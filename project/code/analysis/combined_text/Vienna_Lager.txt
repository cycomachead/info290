worst
beer
i
have
ever
had
3
075
no
está
mal
overall
a
lacking
humdrum
lager
no
mas
overall
a
great
for
my
tastes
amber
lager
it
seems
to
be
they
brewed
an
amber
ale
with
lager
yeast
rather
than
a
lager
with
some
specialty
malts
im
not
positive
i
can
slam
it
back
like
some
easier
drinking
amber
lagers
but
the
first
one
sure
does
go
down
better
it
began
foaming
through
the
neck
as
soon
as
i
popped
the
cap
which
is
always
my
cue
to
begin
a
gentle
pour
as
you
might
imagine
i
was
faced
with
a
lot
of
head
so
i
decided
to
let
things
settle
through
a
rest
before
continuing
finally
a
dense
finger
of
lighttan
head
that
was
collapsing
in
on
itself
like
a
black
hole
color
was
a
deep
copperyamber
srm
13
17
with
nequality
clarity
nose
was
sweet
but
pleasant
with
notes
of
caramel
freshly
baked
bread
and
honey
that
is
what
i
am
usually
looking
for
in
a
lager
the
honeylike
sweetness
mouthfeel
was
mediumtofull
almost
but
not
quite
creamy
it
was
sweet
of
course
and
the
bready
malt
was
in
balance
with
the
honey
sweetness
i
was
really
digging
this
especially
following
another
aal
finish
was
semisweet
with
a
taste
like
honeydrizzled
biscuits
i
would
certainly
drink
uno
mas
of
these
eh
mediocre
poured
from
a
brown
12
oz
bottle
has
a
dark
bronze
color
with
a
12
inch
head
smell
is
of
light
malts
grains
taste
is
malts
caramel
some
hops
very
refreshing
and
easy
drinking
feels
medium
bodied
in
the
mouth
and
overall
is
good
summertime
beer
o
tasty
goes
down
easily
not
too
filling
decent
kick
good
representation
of
style
this
is
a
solid
beer
to
drink
for
a
while
as
amber
lagers
go
this
is
a
great
one
pairs
well
with
fresh
street
tacos
too
luscious
white
head
lacy
and
robust
several
inches
tall
and
long
lasting
medium
amber
color
clear
but
leaning
dark
smells
like
lager
yeast
more
than
grains
but
dry
red
malt
is
ahead
of
sweeter
caramel
malts
on
the
nose
at
least
a
little
sweeter
in
the
flavor
even
brown
sugar
notes
here
but
everything
is
so
relaxed
its
just
sort
of
a
refreshing
nondescript
all
day
drinker
for
me
nobody
would
ever
know
this
is
over
6
abv
feels
barely
like
5
clean
as
lagers
are
but
this
one
is
super
down
easy
even
washes
away
serrano
pepper
heat
rather
effectively
better
than
many
ive
had
from
lost
coast
a
real
crowd
pleaser
here
with
a
medium
but
refreshing
body
happy
carbonation
and
enough
hops
to
balance
out
a
slightly
more
elaborate
grain
bill
it
works
for
me
especially
with
mexican
food
and
i
suspect
it
would
work
for
anyone
in
that
context
beyond
that
maybe
a
little
boring
but
a
tasty
brew
overall
that
looks
superb
and
overall
does
the
trick
pours
a
murky
honey
brown
with
a
2
inch
foamy
orangetan
head
that
settles
to
a
film
on
top
of
the
beer
foamy
swaths
of
lace
form
around
the
glass
on
the
drink
down
smell
is
of
toasted
malt
caramel
and
some
slight
sour
cherry
aromas
taste
is
of
toasted
and
slightly
burnt
malt
caramel
and
a
slight
sour
fruit
note
on
the
finish
there
is
a
mild
roasty
bitterness
on
the
palate
with
each
sip
this
beer
has
a
lower
level
of
carbonation
with
a
slightly
crisp
mouthfeel
overall
this
is
a
pretty
average
beer
flavor
wise
and
definitely
not
something
i
would
go
after
again
opinion
overall
this
is
a
pretty
decent
beer
i
personally
like
the
malty
balance
but
they
may
have
overdone
it
a
bit
for
this
style
i
like
the
high
carbonation
and
it
definitely
keeps
the
beer
from
getting
boring
if
you
are
a
big
fan
of
the
amber
style
i
would
definitely
recommend
that
you
pick
this
one
up
to
recalibrate
yourself
toward
the
malty
side
of
this
style
as
it
is
still
probably
within
the
guidelines
but
it
is
a
bit
of
a
loner
for
a
brewery
on
the
west
coast
nice
mouthful
of
malt
caramel
is
the
pleasant
taste
hops
come
along
before
long
surprisingly
tart
after
a
few
sips
a
bit
of
a
dirty
taste
after
a
while
nice
roasted
malt
nose
a
hint
of
fruit
quite
attractive
coppery
amber
in
the
tulip
glass
nice
lacing
clean
and
well
made
a
good
quaff
each
sip
renews
the
malty
flavor
with
just
a
touch
of
sweetness
taste
is
definitely
caramely
on
the
malts
fairly
sweet
and
has
some
butterflavored
diacetyl
issues
that
actually
work
ok
for
this
style
of
brew
moderate
toasty
flavors
but
never
nears
harsh
and
it
probably
helps
that
i
cannot
detect
any
hops
at
all
if
i
did
not
know
better
i
would
have
said
no
way
this
is
a
lager
tastes
more
like
an
ale
with
a
nutty
yeast
presence
i
like
it
well
enough
though
and
would
reach
for
this
before
a
fat
tire
anyday
after
trying
5
different
left
coast
beers
i
feel
like
im
going
back
to
the
early
90s
to
a
brewery
at
the
forefront
of
the
craft
beer
movement
i
think
these
beers
would
have
been
looked
at
as
fantastic
back
in
1992
but
now
they
struggle
to
be
even
average
compared
to
their
modern
counterparts
id
be
more
willing
to
drop
7
bucks
on
a
sixer
of
this
than
ever
pay
6
bucks
for
a
bomber
again
a
decent
beer
fairly
simplistic
not
much
complexity
at
all
but
nothing
particularly
bad
about
it
one
of
the
more
pleasant
beers
ive
had
from
left
coast
however
just
not
one
i
think
id
pick
up
again
not
a
bad
beer
for
a
hot
day
but
not
too
complex
lacking
any
strong
hop
flavor
so
the
finish
is
a
little
flat
but
a
wholly
drinkable
beer
that
is
a
step
up
from
the
mass
market
stuff
that
said
it
is
priced
with
premium
beers
that
are
more
interesting
i
would
use
this
as
a
good
beer
to
introduce
craft
beer
to
someone
as
a
step
up
from
factory
beer
drinkability
is
ok
ok
beer
to
sweet
for
my
tastes
o
a
quite
respectable
version
of
the
style
even
ignoring
the
low
cost
overall
pretty
good
vienna
here
if
you
arent
expecting
the
world
and
thered
be
no
reason
to
considering
the
price
bargain
deal
from
trader
joes
id
consider
buying
it
again
though
if
im
being
honest
it
wouldnt
even
be
close
to
my
first
choice
at
tjs
o
pretty
good
example
of
the
style
and
easy
to
drink
nothing
outstanding
but
certainly
well
worth
the
very
reasonable
price
definitely
a
malty
brew
but
that
was
to
be
expected
with
the
style
o
this
is
my
first
time
buying
beer
brewed
by
tjs
and
it
was
not
as
disappointing
as
i
thought
it
would
be
pleasantly
surprised
actually
i
am
drinking
this
one
to
do
homework
on
a
recipe
i
plan
to
brew
the
recipe
is
a
vienna
malt
ipa
think
it
might
work
well
find
out
in
the
meantime
if
you
want
something
different
yet
vaguely
familiar
check
out
this
brew
rjt
got
this
as
part
of
a
josephsbrau
12
beer
variety
pack
for
9
99
pours
a
dark
amber
color
with
an
attractive
head
taste
is
mostly
hops
pretty
expected
taste
of
this
style
of
beer
definitely
better
than
some
other
red
aleamber
lager
style
beers
that
ive
tried
overall
the
beer
is
very
tasty
and
i
can
see
myself
picking
up
a
sixer
of
this
next
time
im
at
trader
joes
very
good
job
on
this
one
poured
into
a
seattle
beer
week
pint
glass
pours
a
medium
coppery
amber
with
a
one
finger
ivory
head
kept
intact
by
constant
carbonation
aroma
of
sweet
caramel
malt
with
a
touch
of
toasted
malt
mildy
spicy
flavor
is
biscuit
and
lightly
toasted
malt
starts
semisweet
but
turns
somewhat
dry
light
grassy
hops
and
hints
of
wheat
and
grain
finishes
with
earthy
malt
and
light
vegetal
notes
medium
bodied
with
nice
carbonation
a
satisfactory
example
of
a
traditionally
laid
back
style
nothing
too
exciting
here
but
it
is
what
it
sets
out
to
be
a
decent
budget
vienna
lager
finish
is
slightly
off
but
otherwise
a
pleasant
accompaniment
for
a
meal
or
sessioning
will
grab
this
one
again
i
like
the
balance
of
malt
and
hops
a
beer
that
i
would
repeat
at
6
99
a
six
pack
might
even
keep
in
the
beer
fridge
a
nice
little
beer
vienna
style
lagers
confused
flavor
profile
is
utterly
disappointing
the
ingredients
are
obviously
fresh
the
yeast
strain
doesnt
leave
any
unwanted
flavors
its
got
a
lot
of
potential
but
fails
to
deliver
i
wont
revisit
this
one
o
this
beer
is
nice
and
malty
but
is
also
rather
drinkable
its
a
pretty
good
representation
of
the
style
overall
not
a
bad
beer
especial
if
is
ice
cold
if
i
was
in
mood
for
this
style
of
beer
i
would
buy
it
again
the
price
is
right
too
the
taste
is
too
sweet
and
malty
for
my
liking
some
folks
may
like
that
caramel
and
toffee
notes
up
front
low
to
played
down
bitterness
at
the
end
o
this
beer
manages
to
be
better
than
the
sum
of
its
parts
the
flavors
do
not
stand
out
in
any
way
but
something
about
it
is
slightly
better
than
average
looks
good
apart
from
the
lack
of
head
and
its
easy
to
drink
notes
too
sweet
o
a
decent
lager
probably
wont
get
again
the
dms
and
astringent
characters
detract
from
the
experience
good
melanoidin
flavors
though
taste
is
caramelized
toast
with
a
dollop
of
creamed
corn
not
really
a
good
example
of
the
style
or
a
beer
for
that
matter
but
it
does
not
really
taste
all
that
bad
i
have
a
soft
spot
in
my
heart
for
diacetyl
in
ambers
so
this
is
somewhat
enjoyable
for
me
mouthfeel
is
fairly
full
for
the
style
due
to
the
sweetness
and
the
carbonation
is
ample
not
too
bad
despite
all
the
flaws
but
i
am
ok
with
just
having
this
single
a
decent
take
on
the
style
better
than
most
massmarket
lagers
utilizing
the
name
along
with
an
excess
of
adjuncts
while
ignoring
the
traditions
associated
with
it
o
a
nice
beer
from
tjs
perhaps
the
best
of
the
josephs
brau
line
extra
hops
would
make
it
perfect
o
good
vienna
lager
just
not
a
fan
of
vienna
lagers
per
se
very
good
representation
of
the
vienna
lager
style
pours
with
nice
foamy
white
head
and
biscuity
aroma
characteristic
of
the
style
color
is
a
rich
amber
hue
taste
is
enjoyable
with
carmel
biscuit
malt
favor
reminicient
of
fresh
bread
perfect
for
fall
body
is
medium
but
matches
what
i
would
expect
for
this
style
i
tried
this
by
only
purchasing
two
bottles
i
will
easily
pick
up
a
6pack
next
time
at
trader
joes
good
brew
o
i
dont
know
how
much
i
paid
for
this
but
i
know
it
was
cheap
so
its
got
that
going
for
it
inoffensive
but
nothing
memorable
o
these
tj
beers
seem
to
be
doing
a
great
job
of
lowering
my
ravg
their
oatmeal
stout
notwithstanding
but
truth
be
told
this
is
decent
enough
nothing
special
at
all
but
like
the
other
tj
beers
its
price
point
help
mask
its
deficiencies
somewhat
not
a
bad
beer
overall
the
smell
is
the
only
thing
that
held
it
back
i
guess
its
a
matter
of
taste
whether
you
like
this
flabby
style
of
lager
i
suppose
i
should
try
some
of
the
better
examples
of
vienna
lager
so
ill
know
what
its
supposed
to
taste
like
12
oz
bottle
from
tjs
this
vienna
lager
is
simple
to
the
point
and
tasty
and
at
a
damn
good
price
poured
a
12
oz
bottle
into
a
pint
glass
this
vienna
lager
poured
a
clear
amber
color
produced
a
white
head
average
retention
and
it
left
some
lacing
on
the
glass
the
aroma
consisted
of
malted
grain
and
caramel
medium
in
body
this
brew
had
a
nice
toasted
malted
barley
base
and
a
kiss
of
hop
flavor
excellent
mouthfeel
very
nice
example
of
a
vienna
lager
some
of
the
macro
brews
could
take
a
lesson
from
this
lager
prost
pours
a
clear
copper
color
with
a
1
inch
foamy
orangewhite
head
that
settles
to
a
film
on
top
of
the
beer
thin
rings
of
lace
line
the
glass
on
the
drink
down
smell
is
malty
and
slightly
metallic
as
well
taste
is
malty
and
slightly
fruity
there
is
a
mild
bitterness
that
quickly
fades
after
each
sip
this
beer
has
a
light
level
of
carbonation
with
a
slightly
crisp
mouthfeel
overall
this
is
a
pretty
average
lager
thats
not
too
bad
but
i
wouldnt
buy
this
one
again
cheap
enough
though
at
1
for
the
bottle
o
overall
this
is
a
good
value
a
nice
easy
drinking
lager
id
seek
this
out
again
from
trader
joes
o
this
beers
only
downfall
is
that
it
is
one
dimensional
you
have
a
big
malt
backbone
and
distinct
caramel
chocolate
barley
and
muncih
but
it
lacks
the
balance
that
would
make
it
a
true
top
beer
i
really
did
like
this
beer
in
fact
im
probably
going
to
go
buy
some
more
today
and
i
recommend
you
do
the
same
not
real
great
might
be
oxidized
but
is
several
months
before
the
best
buy
date
so
its
not
due
to
age
1
5
finger
head
which
rapidly
dissipates
on
a
hazy
amber
with
golden
hues
body
nice
lace
very
malt
heavy
aroma
almost
like
you
are
smelling
it
in
the
brew
tank
a
little
musty
flavor
is
also
a
thick
sweet
caramel
malt
flavor
nothing
watered
down
about
this
one
i
actually
really
like
this
flavor
its
very
cereal
like
medium
to
full
body
for
the
style
and
moderate
carbonation
very
drinkable
overall
i
think
this
is
a
very
easy
drinking
lager
with
a
great
taste
i
enjoyed
it
a
lot
o
despite
a
few
minor
flaws
its
a
decent
beer
for
the
price
of
budweiser
which
is
always
welcome
in
my
book
the
taste
was
a
little
malty
with
some
good
spices
it
just
wasnt
to
my
liking
its
caramelized
very
well
but
something
else
was
holding
it
back
for
me
didnt
like
this
one
at
all
avoid
m
the
feeling
is
nice
pleasant
starting
with
some
sweetness
and
a
little
bitterness
ending
o
a
very
well
made
beer
to
style
the
flavour
is
right
where
i
need
it
to
be
at
5
99
a
sixer
this
is
a
steal
di
wish
i
had
known
this
was
made
by
gordon
biersch
because
it
tastes
exactly
like
their
marzen
which
isnt
exactly
my
favorite
marzen
dr
its
very
drinkable
decently
priced
and
of
pretty
good
quality
id
have
it
again
especially
if
it
were
on
draught
smooth
mouthfeel
just
right
and
extremely
drinkable
excellent
beer
as
an
amazing
price
5
99
for
a
sixer
very
good
beer
nice
as
we
easy
into
autumn
heres
a
little
shocker
to
come
out
of
trader
joes
and
what
has
been
mentioned
many
times
over
as
a
bonus
the
price
is
tough
to
beat
t
roasted
malts
come
out
first
and
theres
a
slightly
bitter
quality
to
them
almost
like
they
were
overroasted
a
bit
slight
bit
of
breadiness
creeps
in
with
some
faded
hops
on
the
finish
the
final
taste
is
slightly
off
with
a
hint
of
aspirin
the
carbonation
was
good
too
and
it
wasnt
until
i
worked
my
way
down
my
glass
that
i
was
able
to
pick
up
any
of
the
alcohol
its
present
but
not
enough
to
detract
from
having
more
than
one
in
a
session
if
more
of
the
trader
joes
carried
alcohol
id
certainly
get
this
again
for
a
cheap
beer
this
is
about
as
good
as
it
gets
overall
a
decent
lager
that
tastes
a
lot
like
a
marzin
very
malt
forward
but
still
good
taste
is
very
nice
toasty
bread
grain
caramelly
nuttiness
light
sweetness
with
balancing
light
spicypepperytoasty
bitterness
it
has
a
nice
firm
wellrounded
character
with
good
balance
and
some
complexity
overall
its
an
excellent
vienna
d
a
good
allaround
beer
poured
a
rich
amber
color
with
an
average
amount
of
white
foamy
head
on
it
doesnt
look
like
a
ton
of
carbonation
throughout
the
glass
smells
like
malt
not
much
else
coming
through
taste
is
decent
nothing
spectacular
kind
of
bready
or
grainy
lightmedium
mouthfeel
reasonably
drinkable
wouldnt
be
my
first
choice
but
its
not
bad
overall
it
was
a
nice
sweet
inexpensiv
beer
but
it
was
just
too
sweet
for
me
good
honey
taste
d
this
is
decent
vienna
lager
very
easy
to
drink
at
5
99
a
sixer
serious
consideration
to
have
on
hand
as
a
flavorful
session
option
still
better
than
most
macros
drinkability
a
dollar
wont
get
you
much
these
days
but
what
it
will
get
you
is
a
decent
sweet
costeffective
brew
for
these
tough
bitter
times
prosit
d
there
is
nothing
really
remarkable
about
this
beer
but
it
is
very
drinkable
the
beer
is
a
beautifully
clear
amber
color
with
an
offwhite
head
and
some
moderately
ok
lacing
there
is
sweet
toasted
malt
in
the
aroma
and
a
hint
of
caramel
that
is
inappropriate
for
the
style
but
inviting
none
the
less
the
initial
flavor
is
sweet
toasted
malt
but
the
sweetness
is
not
at
all
overwhelming
the
flavor
immediately
transitions
to
a
slightly
bitter
finish
but
overall
stays
very
balanced
the
flavor
could
use
some
more
complexity
but
it
is
quite
good
an
average
vienna
lager
but
the
quality
to
price
ratio
of
this
beer
are
more
than
enough
reasons
for
me
to
recommend
it
to
anyone
overall
not
terrible
just
an
average
beer
that
was
about
it
pours
a
slightly
cloudy
amber
body
with
a
one
inch
white
head
smells
initially
malty
caramel
prior
to
a
hoppy
bite
slight
etoh
in
the
nose
tastes
pretty
much
the
same
as
the
smell
somewhat
bready
and
a
good
hop
complimentation
to
support
the
caramel
malt
backbone
feels
somewhat
slick
but
not
too
much
to
make
this
beer
offputting
overall
a
great
tj
beer
and
the
best
of
the
three
tjs
i
have
had
so
far
all
in
all
this
is
a
real
solid
vienna
style
lager
its
sweet
and
malty
with
just
a
hint
of
hops
in
the
after
taste
the
beer
pours
an
crisp
amber
color
with
little
head
and
just
a
little
bit
of
lacing
on
the
glass
its
not
a
go
to
style
for
me
but
this
is
a
session
lager
that
id
go
to
instead
of
a
macro
offering
12
oz
bottle
pours
copper
in
color
with
a
nice
lacy
white
head
not
much
carbonation
aroma
is
malty
bready
but
very
weak
watery
on
a
palate
with
a
caramel
malt
upfront
and
week
spicy
hoppy
finish
not
the
best
vienna
but
very
drinkable
and
inexpensive
i
wonder
if
a
chicagostyle
lager
would
be
thick
the
brew
pours
a
clear
amberorange
topped
by
a
bit
less
than
a
finger
of
white
foam
the
nose
comprises
caramel
buttery
biscuits
some
crumbs
of
rye
bread
and
a
touch
of
orange
the
taste
butters
everything
up
literally
while
simultaneously
increasing
the
orange
flavor
interestingly
this
ends
up
being
a
good
thing
tasting
pretty
tasty
the
body
is
a
light
medium
with
a
light
moderate
carbonation
and
a
smooth
feel
overall
i
was
pleasantly
surprised
with
this
beer
after
being
underwhelmed
with
the
look
and
smell
things
turned
for
the
positive
always
nice
to
have
a
happy
ending
insert
massage
parlor
joke
here
easy
enjoyable
with
good
drinkability
overall
this
is
a
choice
brew
definitely
my
favorite
in
the
style
that
ive
tried
yes
even
better
than
sam
adams
especially
for
the
value
this
makes
a
great
standard
brew
to
keep
around
is
both
enjoyable
enough
for
me
to
appreciate
it
and
simple
enough
for
non
beerloving
friends
to
enjoy
also
certainly
the
strongest
in
the
trader
joes
line
of
these
apparently
germaninspired
brews
will
continue
to
pick
this
one
up
pours
a
light
copper
color
with
a
bit
of
an
off
white
head
that
has
a
bit
of
staying
power
but
then
does
not
leave
behind
too
much
lacing
served
into
a
pilsner
glass
the
nose
is
light
with
some
bread
and
a
bit
of
caramel
malt
not
too
much
involved
maybe
a
bit
of
yeasty
dough
light
to
medium
mouthfeel
with
decent
carbonation
average
drinkabilitynothing
wrong
with
it
but
nothing
good
about
it
either
i
got
a
bunch
of
the
german
style
beers
and
assumed
that
the
vienna
lager
i
e
corona
dos
equis
would
be
mundane
and
uninteresting
i
was
looking
forward
however
to
the
pilsner
the
opposite
is
what
happened
i
loved
the
vienna
very
good
color
flavor
aroma
and
balance
very
good
and
ill
have
it
again
the
pilsner
however
is
not
so
great
drinkability
not
a
bad
brew
to
sip
and
relax
without
having
much
complexity
to
think
about
here
pretty
good
beer
a
little
light
in
the
mouthfeel
department
but
a
decent
hop
profile
without
the
malty
syrupyness
i
sometimes
find
in
socalled
viennastyle
beers
i
think
trader
joes
does
a
much
better
job
than
costco
with
their
inhouse
brand
beer
although
i
have
not
tried
all
of
tjs
offerings
i
think
its
great
that
massmarket
retailers
are
finally
trying
to
make
beers
like
vienna
the
price
is
good
too
and
tjs
is
a
good
shopping
experience
with
no
whole
foods
attitude
refreshing
but
a
little
underattenuated
and
thick
nit
a
bad
beer
theres
just
not
much
to
say
it
really
wasnt
anything
in
the
way
of
interesting
oh
well
drinkability
this
is
a
decent
representation
of
its
style
though
even
sam
adams
boston
lager
is
better
still
this
is
vey
cheap
and
cheaper
than
even
bmc
beers
at
least
here
in
nyc
so
is
definitely
something
worth
buying
even
more
than
once
this
is
really
light
and
wonderful
with
a
nice
drying
and
only
a
mild
citrus
aftertaste
i
could
definitely
drink
these
all
day
and
will
be
buying
more
especially
at
under
6
a
6r
at
trader
joes
taste
starts
out
with
a
nice
sweetness
that
leads
into
a
slight
bitterness
nothing
outstanding
but
still
pretty
good
biscuity
and
bready
with
some
sweet
caramel
malt
the
flavor
is
crisp
clean
and
light
a
slight
hint
of
floral
hops
lends
a
little
bit
of
bitterness
to
this
fairly
well
balanced
beer
mediumlight
bodied
and
well
carbonated
this
is
really
a
nice
light
lager
that
is
very
easy
to
drink
unfortunately
i
think
it
falls
short
of
what
a
good
vienna
lager
should
be
but
it
is
a
decent
enjoyable
lighter
beer
drinkability
a
nice
example
of
a
great
style
i
could
easily
drink
this
all
day
long
as
it
goes
down
real
smooth
and
has
a
bit
better
of
a
flavor
profile
than
many
of
the
mexican
versions
add
to
that
the
6
price
tag
and
this
one
looks
like
a
winner
overall
thumbs
up
to
trader
joes
here
a
wellthanaboveaverage
brew
the
mouth
has
a
decent
heft
for
the
style
and
i
think
it
is
pretty
easy
to
drink
would
go
great
with
oriental
chicken
wings
pork
chops
andor
corn
on
the
cob
oh
and
the
most
important
part
the
price
in
manhattan
a
six
pack
goes
for
12
less
than
a
sixer
of
bud
light
short
offwhite
head
doesnt
last
very
long
transparent
amber
colored
beer
holds
a
few
streams
of
slowly
rising
bubbles
mild
aroma
of
spicy
noble
hops
faint
malt
flavor
up
front
crisp
carbonation
washes
it
away
making
for
a
mild
bittnerness
goes
well
with
the
dry
finish
although
the
abv
is
low
there
is
just
a
hint
of
warming
alcohol
overall
a
crisp
clean
malty
beer
that
goes
down
quite
easily
for
a
5
7
beer
i
really
like
this
especially
for
the
price
this
is
the
best
beer
from
trader
joes
that
i
have
tried
for
the
price
you
cant
go
wrong
here
mouthfeel
remains
constant
doesnt
develop
any
nuances
throughout
gets
some
drinkability
props
for
being
cheap
great
session
beer
not
terribly
special
but
very
well
done
12
ounce
bottle
poured
into
a
pint
glass
clear
amber
color
with
a
fading
white
head
aroma
is
sweet
toasted
grains
and
toffee
with
a
whisper
of
bubblegum
and
red
fruit
with
warmth
toasty
grainy
flavor
seems
pretty
similar
to
an
authentic
vienna
lager
but
without
the
earthy
hops
sweet
and
a
little
sticky
for
a
low
gravity
lager
could
stand
to
be
crisper
mediumlight
body
with
ample
carbonation
drinkability
went
excellent
with
a
meal
in
this
case
a
pork
bbq
sandwich
and
fries
could
have
another
if
i
was
having
a
big
meal
d
honestly
i
could
drink
these
all
night
and
theyre
probably
no
more
than
5
99
per
six
pack
could
get
dangerous
an
above
average
lager
with
good
taste
and
a
great
price
tag
of
5
99
will
return
d
far
from
perfect
but
for
the
price
5
99
for
a
six
pack
of
bottles
i
am
not
complaining
the
kind
of
nasty
aftertaste
fades
away
quickly
and
becomes
less
noticable
as
a
bottle
goes
on
not
bad
not
good
i
might
buy
it
again
just
for
the
price
and
because
i
really
like
vienna
lagers
pours
a
clear
dark
amber
rather
typical
but
still
appealing
with
a
fairly
thick
and
persistent
offwhite
head
aroma
is
malty
but
not
strong
nothing
special
but
not
bad
either
flavor
is
malty
and
has
just
a
hint
of
fruit
and
a
touch
of
caramel
texture
is
fizzy
and
tingly
overall
not
too
shabby
hey
it
is
worth
a
try
and
for
the
price
it
is
a
pretty
good
deal
drinkability
vsl
is
very
drinkable
though
its
not
a
hot
day
tailgate
brew
its
a
high
quality
choice
for
a
lager
on
par
with
its
neighbors
in
south
germany
extremely
tasty
but
bitter
i
could
see
this
being
a
once
in
a
while
kind
of
brew
and
drinking
too
much
is
not
recommended
due
to
the
imbalance
between
the
sweetness
and
bitterness
but
very
decent
indeed
drinkability
this
beers
mouthfeel
doesnt
really
make
it
an
incredibly
drinkable
beer
for
me
due
to
the
carbonation
however
it
is
not
a
bad
beer
by
any
means
especially
considering
i
am
typically
not
a
huge
fan
of
lagers
d
for
the
price
this
is
fantastic
easy
to
finish
and
something
different
thats
pretty
sessionable
ill
check
this
one
out
again
and
try
some
of
the
others
in
the
trader
joes
line
nice
clear
amber
with
a
decent
head
and
very
minor
lacings
aroma
is
mild
malts
taste
is
sweet
dark
malts
with
a
pilsner
like
bitterness
to
the
hops
pretty
well
balanced
mouthfeel
is
good
carbonation
level
alright
slightly
dry
finish
quite
sessionable
for
a
lager
good
value
as
well
tjs
vienna
lager
i
can
see
theres
a
little
bit
of
slightly
yellowed
tan
to
the
creamy
onefinger
head
nice
the
body
is
clear
with
a
deepambercopper
color
pretty
good
head
retention
decent
lacing
the
aroma
is
solid
with
a
clean
distinctly
grainy
maltiness
thats
nutty
and
subtly
caramelish
i
dont
find
any
hops
but
they
are
there
in
the
flavor
floral
and
spicy
backing
the
toasty
maltiness
its
rich
but
i
dont
want
to
say
rich
i
dont
want
to
give
the
impression
that
its
bigger
than
it
is
theres
just
the
right
amount
of
maltiness
to
it
and
theres
just
enough
vienna
malt
in
the
grain
bill
that
its
toasty
nutty
and
delicately
caramelish
with
an
almost
fruity
side
as
well
dont
ask
me
to
explain
that
i
cant
i
dont
know
where
it
comes
from
but
i
find
it
in
quite
a
few
vienna
lagersmaerzens
where
the
grain
bill
has
enough
vienna
malt
to
do
it
as
usual
its
really
well
rounded
with
a
malt
focus
and
hopspice
accent
and
its
perfectly
balanced
by
a
stiff
bitterness
that
allows
the
malt
to
shine
but
keeps
it
from
becoming
cloying
it
finishes
dry
but
with
some
residual
malt
and
hops
lingering
behind
this
can
be
a
hard
style
to
do
because
its
easy
to
go
too
light
or
too
full
but
theyve
nailed
it
id
even
prefer
this
to
some
of
the
more
watereddown
versions
coming
out
of
germany
for
oktoberfest
these
days
really
nice
worth
trying
im
getting
a
bit
of
carmel
slight
hops
some
malts
overall
id
say
this
is
good
very
drinkable
again
this
is
another
beer
that
i
dont
find
all
that
complex
but
easy
to
drink
would
buy
again
not
bad
at
all
pretty
spot
on
for
the
style
a
definite
session
beer
and
a
good
example
of
the
style
buy
one
for
a
buck
at
trader
joes
d
high
not
too
flavorful
before
it
warms
a
bit
i
thought
boston
lager
and
maybe
brooklyn
lager
were
vienna
lagers
and
so
i
expected
this
to
taste
more
like
those
but
this
really
tastes
nothing
like
those
for
example
i
cant
say
i
detected
hops
at
all
in
this
very
much
on
the
malty
side
but
its
cheap
so
its
worth
trying
in
case
you
like
it
d
this
is
an
okay
vienna
lager
very
easy
to
drink
and
very
affordable
drinkability
an
overall
mediocre
beer
the
fresh
grain
smell
and
flavor
is
impressive
and
refreshing
but
not
much
else
going
for
it
my
first
and
last
of
this
one
d
one
of
the
better
of
the
trader
joes
offerings
along
with
winterfest
lager
and
trinity
ale
ill
be
bringing
back
some
of
these
in
6ers
to
take
to
poker
night
in
the
future
a
solid
amber
lager
that
i
actually
enjoy
more
than
sa
boston
lager
for
its
mellowness
pours
a
clear
amber
color
with
decent
head
poor
head
retention
and
little
lacing
smells
of
lager
cleanliness
and
some
grass
sharp
rather
sour
aftertaste
that
lessens
with
more
drinks
stronger
than
average
carbonation
rather
bland
characteristics
plus
the
sour
taste
makes
it
hard
to
recommend
this
brew
d
a
good
beer
to
have
with
a
meal
thai
is
what
i
had
or
over
a
game
of
cards
but
nothing
amazing
thanks
john
drinkability
not
bad
for
the
price
i
suppose
and
it
can
be
sessioned
but
more
flavor
and
a
bigger
body
would
do
a
lot
for
this
brew
fyi
you
can
fill
any
sixer
with
any
6
beers
to
form
a
sampler
at
trader
joes
d
pretty
good
solidly
malty
lager
pours
a
nice
amber
copper
color
with
a
medium
head
some
lacing
on
the
surface
aroma
is
muted
herbal
and
grassy
hops
taste
is
mostly
caramel
and
toasted
flavors
becomes
a
little
sweet
then
finishes
with
a
slight
bitterness
some
herbal
hops
medium
bodied
not
overly
carbonated
quite
drinkable
overall
a
pleasant
malty
beer
edit
tried
again
jan
09
smell
is
lighter
taste
is
flatter
and
offers
lighter
carbonation
dinged
the
taste
5
as
a
result
the
dumbing
down
continues
i
guess
d
a
pretty
average
vienna
lager
for
the
price
its
worth
it
especially
if
someone
offers
you
one
i
wouldnt
go
out
of
my
way
looking
for
this
brew
though
the
vienna
lager
is
one
that
is
not
brewed
as
much
as
it
should
be
in
my
estimation
to
me
this
style
is
an
excellent
first
beer
for
those
unfamiliar
with
craft
brewing
this
particular
take
on
this
style
is
well
done
sweet
malty
and
crisp
there
is
nothing
objectionable
here
the
mouthfeel
is
a
little
sticky
but
overall
this
is
a
well
made
lager
that
is
very
easy
to
drink
recommended
poured
true
to
style
bright
amber
with
a
red
hue
nose
is
bit
weak
the
mouthfeel
is
very
limited
watery
lacks
complexity
and
charachter
of
the
style
this
brew
needs
some
tlc
and
i
wont
buy
again
or
recommend
however
if
youre
looking
for
a
cheap
brew
to
down
this

you

a
decent

it
is
very
malty
and
reminds
me
of
sam
adams
with
less
hoppieness
not
a
good
thing
but
this
makes
it
more
aproachable
than
a
more
highly
hopped
version
of
this
style
great
starter
beer
for
the
less
adventurous
but
currious
beer
drinker
if
heineken
made
an
amber
it
would
be
just
like
this
sampled
at

the

pretty

overall
it
is
not
a

beer
but
it
is
not
a
good
beer
it
has
a
nice
pour
and
a
rich
color
but
the
taste
is
nothing
to
be
admired
it
tastes
like
a
cheep
super
market
beer
except
classyer
because
it
was
purchased
at
trader
joes
it
is
good
for
a
cheep
night
before

but
i
would
not
purchase
it
again

a
good
beer
to
have
around
undistinguished
vienna
lager
clean
with
clear
coppery
color
and
weak
evanescent
head
very
little
maltiness
which
is
what
brings
me
pleasure
with
this
style
bitterness
was
in
balance
but
no
detectable
noble
hop
flavor
or
aroma
the
only
plus
was
the
4
99
price
on
a
sixpack
but
if
you
like
this
style
id
spring
an
extra
buck
or
2
for
a
sixpack
of
negro
modela
one
of
many
good
but
not
great
wellpriced
beers
from
tj
you
could
do
a
lot
worse
for
less
than
6six
pack
a
very
smooth
drinkable
maltoriented
lager
d
very
easy
to
drink
and
very
satisfying
for
this
style
even
if
you
dont
know
the
style
this
is
a
smooth
and
drinkable
beer
ive
always
called
this
style
a
sort
of
oktoberfest
light
this
beer
epitomizes
that
wonderful
stuff
this
all
leads
to
a
finish
which
is
slightly
stale
and
of
medium
duration
not
really
much
to
this
beer
appears
a
bright
amberorange
color
with
a
onefinger
head
that
thinned
out
quickly
but
did
leave
some
very
faint
lace
smells
nice
and
malty
with
some
slightly
fruity
esthers
and
floral
scents
as
well
nothing
overwhelming
in
the
aroma
but
quite
pleasant
i
almost
pick
up
some
trace
hints
of
vanilla
and
caramel
as
well
the
taste
is
also
pleasant
simple
malty
with
some
fruitiness
in
the
finish
and
easy
drinking
a
bit
watery
though
which
is
too
bad
but
overall
its
not
a
badtasting
beer
mouthfeel
is
a
bit
weak
but
its
certainly
not
an
undrinkable
beer
ive
definitely
had
worse
lagers
before
they
could
up
the
malt
characteristics
of
this
one
for
sure
but
the
folks
at
trader
joes
have
made
a
decent
beer
here
there
was
quite
a
bit
of
fizziness
in
the
mouth
but
i
usually
like
that
and
it
was
more
fullbodied
then
the
mexican
versions
of
this
styly
usually
offered
the
unpleasant
aftertastes
might
be
broken
up
with
the
right
food
pairing
here
to
allow
the
initial
flavors
a
chance
but
even
at
trader
joes
belowabuckabottle
price
makes
it
hard
to
recommend
pours
a
clear
red
amber
with
a
one
finger
head
and
little
retention
or
lacing
aroma
is
all
malts
mostly
sweet
and
no
hops
taste
is
mostly
mildly
sweet
malts
not
too
sweet
but
a
nice
balance
for
drinking
with
food
mouthfeel
is
pretty
good
although
its
a
little
clingy
very
drinkable
and
could
be
sessioned
excellent
beer
for
less
than
1
so
yeah
a
nice
quaffable
beer
with
a
good
malt
presence
at
less
than
a
buck
a
beer
i
cant
complain
but
i
can
get
better
beers
for
that
price
i
grabbed
a
single
of
their
weizen
while
i
was
at
the
store
and
i
am
wishing
that
i
had
bought
a
sixer
of
the
weizens
and
a
single
of
the
vienna
but
im
not
unhappy
with
the
sixer
of
vienna
and
i
rarely
buy
beers
by
the
sixpack
so
take
that
as
you
will
drank
a
little
above
average
for
the
abv
i
didnt
pick
stale
or
oxidized
characteristics
up
this
was
dissapointing

not

knock

after

its
fucking
beer
not

aftertaste
kind
of
disappointing
finish
definately
drinkable
at
thsuch
a
low
price
might
try
again
d
except
for
the
appearance
everything
about
this
beer
reminded
me
of
olde
english
malt
liquor
easy
to
drink
and
the
price
was
right
bronzed
straw
with
a
slightly
copperamber
color
clear
average
appearance
when
poured
into
a
pint
glass
the
head
is
a
lightly
golden
cream
color
the
aroma
is
dominated
by
a
sweet
honey
character
with
an
underlying
maltiness
theres
also
a
slight
hoppiness
to
the
aroma
and
a
bit
of
funk
somewhat
offputting
at
first
on
the
palate
it
starts
off
sweet
with
the
honey
coming
on
first
this
turns
into
a
pleasing
malty
flavor
with
toasted
grain
and
a
light
kiss
of
hops
and
finally
finishes
clean
and
dry
not
much
lingering
flavor
besides
a
pleasant
grainlike
aftertaste
quite
good
for
the
price
though
i
dont
know
the
style
well
enough
to
comment
on
this
beers
particular
adherence
to
a
vienna
style
lager
the
score
seems
high
to
me
too
but
im
reminded
that
we
review
beer
with
style
in
mind
the
vienna
style
isnt
something
that
has
much
of
an
elite
quality
to
it
but
the
trader
joes
like
many
bas
i
know
who
brews
this
stuff
version
is
quite
solid
exceptionally
drinkable
flavorful
and
a
beer
i
can
imagine
pairing
with
a
good
number
of
cuisines

with
an

that
allows
a
slightly

while
keeping
the

alive
finishes
with
mellow
crystal
and
vienna
toastiness
and
pale

malt
residual
sweetness
lasting
noble

flavor
also
provides
a
magnificent
balance
and
promotes
the
high
drinkability
not
outstanding
but
it
is
wellmade
inexpensive
and
a
great
example
of
the
style
pursue
the
purchase
of
this
one
only
if
youre
on
a
restrictive
budget
drinkability
for
the
price

the

this

its
still
quite
drinkable
for

at

its

to
beat
in

of
these

very

perhaps
the
best
to
come
from
this
trader
joes
brand
i
definitely
recommend
it
if
you
like
malty

and
5

a

it
is
a
steal
overall
the
price
is

this
is
an

stab
at

hey
what
do
you
know
straight
across
the
board
3s
this
is
the
epitomy
of
average
thats
not
a
bad
thing
at
all
lagers
will
rarely
blow
me
away
but
if
it
hits
the
key
points
like
this
one
did
and
have
something
unique
about
it
than
its
worth
the
time
drinkability
i
really
enjoy
drinking
this
beer
its
light
but
has
a
hearty
and
complex
flavor
that
doesnt
get
old
too
quickly
i
imagine
i
could
knock
back
quite
a
few
of
these
at
a
barbecue
drinkability

i
dont
find
this
beer
compelling
and
i
could
not
recommend
it
decent
and
the
price
makes
it
all
the
more
drinkable
mouthfeel
is
rather
nice
with
a
chewy
body
that
has
a
creamy
profile
an
easy
drinking
beer
that
doesnt
require
too
much
thinking
refreshing
and
under
6
for
a
sixer
id
say
its
a
good
crossover
beer
and
ill
pick
it
up
again
if
the
mood
strikes
me
very
drinkable
and
a
good
try
at
a
vienna
nice
i
would
have
again
overall
impression
not
a
bad
beer
but
not
a
great
one
either
not
bad
for
cheap
beer
from
the
supermarket
but
i
wont
be
seeking
it
out
again
moderate
to
thin
mouthfeel
but
fairly
smooth
this
is
a
drinkable
beer
i
guess
but
not
really
exciting
and
not
my
favorite
example
of
the
style
by
a
longshot
an
average
beer
but
for
5
bucks
a
6
pack
im
not
too
dissapointed
this
is
basically
gordon
biersch
marzen
as
gb
contract
brews
for
tjs
notice
the
logo
for
gb
and
tj
is
the
same
except
the
lettering
pours
with
a
brilliantly
clear
deep
copper
almost
amber
color
it
is
topped
by
a
frothy
approaching
creamy
tan
head
that
comes
about
from
a
slight
carbonation
the
aroma
is
almost
nonexistent
but
for
a
lightly
toasted
biscuit
type
maltiness
and
a
suggestion
of
spicy
hoppiness
the
taste
is
lightly
sweet
up
front
with
malty
notes
of
caramel
the
finish
is
lightly
spicy
with
a
hint
of
balancing
bitterness
that
comes
to
dominate
the
finish
but
in
a
good
way
as
it
makes
you
want
to
take
another
sip
this
is
a
simple
brew
it
is
nice
and
refreshing
but
is
lacking
a
depth
of
flavor
that
i
would
like
to
see
in
a
vienna
lager
i
assumed
this
was
a
gb
beer
since
brewed
in
san
jose
others
notes
suggest
this
is
true
for
4
99
not
a
bad
starter
beer
for
macro
converts
drinkability
nothing
special
here
just
a
run
of
the
mill
lager
it
tastes
exactly
like
a
gordon
biersch
beer
should
no
need
to
try
again
an
ok
drinking
beer
not
great
but
it
will
do
for
a
watching
tv
beer
not
my
favorite
of
the
trader
joe
beers
but
if
this
and
heineken
were
my
two
choices
i
would
grab
this
like
all
the
other
tj
beers
it
is
a
good
value
for
the
price
overall
well
nothing
stunning
here
but
not
a
drainpour
either
tjs
vienna
lager
would
work
as
a
decent
intro
beer
for
a
macrolover
but
it
wont
set
a
longtime
beer
enthusiasts
pulse
racing
the
beer
is
smooth
in
your
mouth
with
that
sweetness
what
is
it
some
type
of
berry
there
it
is
a
mellow
sweetness
which
is
good
and
also
why
i
probably
cant
figure
it
out
some
malt
in
that
sweetness
and
just
noticeable
hops
the
aftertaste
is
one
of
the
better
ones
for
a
beer
it
stays
there
and
subtley
reminds
you
to
take
another
pull
if
you
wait
too
long
not
an
overpowering
beer
but
solid
in
a
lot
of
ways
and
did
its
job
while
i
prepared
stirfry
for
dinner
ill
get
this
one
again
overall
not
much
happening
in
this
one
far
from
awful
but
not
one
that
i
would
buy
again
overall
this
beer
is
a
winner
id
buy
it
again
very
smooth
great
lager
this
is
what
american
lagers
should
strive
to
be
like
a
solid
amber
colored
vienna
style
lager
the
beer
has
a
nice
roasted
malt
backbone
with
only
a
touch
of
sweetness
the
finish
is
crisp
and
refreshing
this
has
been
one
of
my
go
to
beers
this
summer
since
i
first
saw
it
in
the
grocery
store
a
few
months
back
i
fell
in
love
with
millstreams
baltic
porter
over
the
winter
this
is
another
offering
from
the
amana
ia
based
brewery
that
does
not
disappoint
the
body
is
medium
maybe
on
the
lighter
side
but
not
too
thin
crispness
is
just
active
enough
a
very
drinkable
respectable
amber
lager
perhaps
it
wont
blow
you
away
but
it
certainly
wont
disappoint
you
either
nice
and
refreshing
o
a
decent
low
abv
beer
nothing
mind
blowing
just
an
easy
drinking
lager
prognosis
thirst
quencher
it
is
and
not
bad
just
not
overwhelmingly
fill
in
the
blank
or
not
overwhelming
in
any
way
head
dissipated
quickly
can
not
get
past
the
sour
aroma
and
sour
taste
will
not
buy
again
but
probably
is
just
my
personal
preference
for
a
more
balanced
overall
drinkable
beer
without
a
major
spike
in
one
characteristic
that
you
fixate
on
while
drinking
medium
bodied
with
light
carbonation
not
bad
but
nothing
to
get
excited
about
either
i
will
pass
on
this
one
in
the
future
an
above
average
vienna
lager
not
a
bad
beer
overall
others
in
this
style
have
more
hops
presence
than
this
one
which
is
a
positive
to
me
it
is
a
touch
sweet
but
the
nut
flavor
and
hop
bite
at
the
end
balance
it
nicely
easy
drinking
and
worth
a
try
finishes
clean
with
light
bitterness
and
lingering
sweetness
quite
drinkable
nothing
spectacular
but
id
drink
it
again
this
beer
pours
a
cloudy
orangeamber
color
the
head
is
one
inch
in
height
and
recedes
quickly
into
minimal
lacing
the
aroma
is
of
caramel
malt
with
a
fairly
strong
sourness
to
it
it
smells
more
like
a
berliner
weisse
than
a
vienna
lager
its
not
a
bad
aroma
on
the
contrary
it
is
actually
quite
pleasant
it
just
isnt
what
a
vienna
lager
should
smell
like
the
taste
is
a
lot
less
sour
then
the
aroma
but
there
is
still
a
faint
hint
of
sourness
in
the
background
up
front
there
there
are
some
nice
caramel
notes
with
some
light
floral
hops
i
think
i
would
like
it
a
bit
better
if
the
sourness
were
a
little
stronger
the
mouthfeel
is
medium
bodied
with
low
carbonation
for
the
style
overall
im
not
sure
if
something
is
off
or
if
the
brewer
really
did
intend
on
this
beer
beings
slightly
sour
either
way
i
cant
see
myself
drinking
this
one
again
o
a
solis
sessionable
lager
worth
buying
o
an
ok
beer
but
other
than
the
aroma
it
more
or
less
disappointed
me
o
tasty
with
a
5
abv
i
could
drink
this
one
again
recommended
this
is
a
very
nice
and
easily
drinkable
beer
not
at
the
top
for
the
style
but
overall
a
beer
that
would
easily
be
sessionable
taste
my
first
impression
is
of
a
slightly
above
average
oktoberfest
the
beer
is
smooth
light
bodied
full
of
biscuity
toasted
malts
and
ultra
drinkable
it
does
come
in
a
bit
fruity
though
maybe
cotton
candy
like
a
pinch
of
spice
from
the
hops
compliments
the
finish
along
with
that
lager
sulphurlike
quality
im
detecting
a
bit
of
apple
and
white
grape
juice
in
there
as
well
for
a
beer
clocking
in
at
below
5
i
have
to
give
millstream
credit
for
pulling
out
tons
of
flavor
from
the
malt
bill
if
youre
looking
for
a
beer
to
pair
with
bratskraut
or
chili
look
no
further
taste
is
again
somewhat
average
it
certainly
has
the
malted
punch
that
my
nose
picked
up
the
fruit
tones
arent
there
as
much
but
it
is
slightly
sour
its
not
complex
so
i
wouldnt
call
it
balanced
but
it
is
enjoyable
its
good
in
its
simplicity
o
tasty
goes
down
very
easily
not
too
filling
mild
kick
good
representation
of
style
this
is
a
nice
solid
beer
worth
pounding
for
while
i
seem
to
be
consistantly
disappointed
by
this
brew
it
looks
good
but
has
kind
of
an
odd
slightly
sour
smell
to
it
the
taste
has
some
good
malt
character
but
that
same
slightly
sour
essence
detracts
from
that
too
much
for
me
to
enjoy
it
the
body
is
good
but
the
sourness
seems
to
linger
ive
had
a
bottle
before
that
i
drained
because
it
was
so
bad
this
would
most
likely
be
a
good
beer
if
millstream
did
better
quality
control
on
it
ive
havent
had
this
problem
before
with
their
other
brews
cheers
d
i
would
try
this
one
again
in
iowa
but
never
again
any
where
else
m
light
body
with
good
carbonation
has
a
sticky
finish
taste
smooth
and
the
malt
content
seems
to
be
just
right
thin
enough
yet
chewy
would
have
liked
to
have
seen
just
a
little
more
hop
zest
2030
ibu
instead
of
what
tastes
like
1015
but
its
probably
more
in
the
tradition
of
a
good
vienna
or
oktoberfest
plenty
of
that
nutty
caramel
thing
going
on
in
the
mouthfeel
but
it
just
is
too
middle
of
the
road
for
me
drinkability
not
much
complexity
but
it
is
tasty
rich
and
very
drinkable
as
an
iowan
i
hate
to
say
this
especially
since
this
beer
just
won
a
gold
medal
at
the
world
beer
cup
when
it
comes
to
vienna
style
lager
i
think
trader
joes
vienna
style
lager
beats
schild
brau
by
a
hair
though
d
not
my
favorite
but
would
drink
again
the
liquid
was
a
very
light
amber
copper
color
with
a
thin
white
head
it
smells
mostly
of
sweet
caramel
malt
there
is
a
hint
of
nutty
malt
and
its
a
little
yeasty
i
could
taste
some
apricot
also
toasted
bread
and
sweet
caramel
candy
the
body
is
light
medium
and
the
carbonation
kind
of
bites
the
tongue
and
it
leaves
the
mouth
sticky
the
schild
brau
has
very
rich
flavor
for
a
lager
i
would
love
to
be
able
to
get
this
on
a
normal
basis
quite
simply
this
is
outstanding
nice
amber
color
good
taste
and
feel
a
little
bit
of
a
bitter
aftertaste
almost
no
head
at
all
when
pouring
its
worth
a
taste
d
sessionable
relatively
but
interesting
as
well
notes
an
averagemiddle
of

beer
not
bad
but
not
outstanding
a
lot
of
malty
flavor
with
a
decent

i
know
i
like
bock
brews
the
best
but
this
brew
is
my
top
favorite
brew
from
millstream
brewing
co

my

when
we
visit
her
sister
of
whom
lives
in
cedar
rapids
not
too
far
away
from
the
amanas
we
always
go
to
the
colony
where
there
the
brewery
in
located
which
i
think
is
in
middle
amana
great
beer
i
really
enjoyed
this
beer
looks
great
dark
amber
color
with
nice
head
great
taste
and
flavor
very
drinkable
for
any
beer
drinker
being
in
iowa
i
need
to
try
some
more
millstream
beers
this
was
the
first
ive
had
and
i
look
forward
to
trying
others
the
palate
starts
malty
and
ends
malty
but
the
middle
has
a
weird
musty
hop
palate
that
doesnt
bridge
the
gap
between
sweet
and
bitter
very
well
all
and
all
a
nice
session
lager
that
i
wouldnt
mind
buying
again
md
light
to
medium
bodied
and
very
crisp
feel
very
easy
drinking
i
had
several
of
these
in
iowa
over
the
holidays
from
the
sampler
pack
and
it
was
by
far
my
least
favorite
in
flavor
those
were
drinking
straight
out
of
the
bottle
vs
this
review
where
it
was
from
a
glass
made
a
huge
difference
from
the
bottle
not
palatable
at
all
very
metallic
from
the
glass
the
floral
and
malt
sweetness
comes
through
and
hides
most
of
the
metal
decent
beer
not
my
favorite

some

drinkable
this
is
a
nice
one
to
drink
d
this
is
quite
quaffable
and
enjoyable
the
flavors
are
subtle
but
there
seems
to
be
a
decent
amount
of
complexity
for
such
a
light
beer
this
leaves
a
nice
flavor
in
the
mouth
which
will
keep
you
coming
back
for
more
this
typically
isnt
my
style
but
i
found
this
version
to
be
quite
enjoyable
not
bad
at
all
pretty
easy
to
drink
and
a
nice
flow
of
flavors
that
complimented
each
other
a
very
drinkable
beer
especially
sitting
out
in
the

the

lots

perhaps
a

bready

no

the
mouthfeel

with
an
almost
creamy

a

this

be
an
easy

beer
the
mouthfeel
is
not
very
refreshing
and
is
kind
of
rough
i
do
like
the
carbonation
because
it
redeems
this
brew
from
being

undrinkable

ofttimes
gets
shuffled
into

favorite

ever
awesome
taste
this
was
kind
of
a
hazy
amber
color
it
had
off
tasting
muddled
grainy
sweetness
this
was
probably
at
least
partially
due
to
dirty
lines
at
pnc
park
but
still
overall
the
flavors
of
the
brew
were
rather
nice
as
the
drier
yet
still
somewhat
complex
flavors
of
the
brew
were
quite
appropriate
for
the
style
making
it
a
rather
good
choice
if
only
the
body
was
a
bit
thinner
and
carbonation
a
bit
higher
than
this
would
have
been
very
enjoyable
for
the
flavors
and
style
overall
however
the
brew
is
well
worth
a
try
good
with
mexican
food
and
most
food
really
perhaps
its
best
attribute
good
food
pairing
the
flavor
is
more
helles
than
vienna
to
me
but
still
could
pass
for
either
there
is
a
lot
of
pils
taste
for
the
low
abv
with
mild
floral
hop
accents
and
subtle
yeast
flavor
which
adds
some
depth
with
a
gentle
mineral
note
the
overall
impression
is
it
is
pretty
decent
for
a
german
style
lager
pretty
expressive
and
very
full
of
flavor
but
i
consider
it
more
helles
so
it
doesnt
fit
the
style
to
a
t
in
my
opinion
but
very
drinkable
nonetheless
a
solid
drinkable
pilsner
which
goes
down
smooth
and
pairs
well
with
average
food
like
a
burger
or
a
chicken
sandwich
doesnt
try
to
do
much
more
than
that
just
a
solid
lager
worth
having
easy
to
drink
and
worth

eliot
ness
this
brewery
does
not
consistently
produce
this
product
well
i
am
not
sure
why
this
beer
is
totally
different
than
in
the
past
but
i
will
never
order
it
again
moderately
overpriced
but
crushes
tha
mainstream
miller
coors
and
budweisers
of
the
world
o
tasty
goes
down
easily
not
too
filling
mild
kick
good
representation
of
style
this
is
a
solid
beer
to
drink
for
a
while
if
youre
in
the
mood
for
the
style
get
this
as
it
is
good
very
drinkable
but
keep
in
mind
this
isnt
a
traditional
pilsner
as
the
label
suggests
overall
served
itself
well
as
an
aperitif
before
heating
up
some
sad
old
leftovers
thanks
penn
pilsner
thank
you
for
that
frosty
gold
beer
with
a
thin
soapy
head
has
a
bready
fruity
aroma
with
hints
of
spice
and
orange
flavors
of
fruit
oats
light
spice
the
taste
is
very
crisp
and
dry
has
a
good
body
without
seeming
heavythis
is
certainly
something
id
drink
again
flagship
beer
with
flagship
taste
this
is
ok
though
i
finds
its
much
better
as
it
warms
that
said
i
have
fond
memories
of
visiting
penn
brewing
a
few
years
ago
and
i
reckon
i
have
a
soft
spot
for
several
of
their
beers
overall
this
is
their
flagship
beer
and
i
must
say
i
dont
like
it
as
much
as
the
gold
or
dark
ow
well
cant
love
them
all
nice
beer
ok
brew
the
tart
edge
threw
me
and
is
really
a
distraction
and
a
negative
trait
a
bit
of
a
raw
beer
notes
a
very
drinkable
lager
overall
cheers
o
not
my
kind
of
beer
nothing
special
going
on
overall
the
smell
ruined
it
for
me
some
days
this
hits
the
spot
and
other
days
not
so
much
today
happens
to
be
a
good
one
sessionable

overall
premium
lagerpilsner
all
the
attributes
are
there
nothing
to
rave
about
but
nothing
to
knock
about
it
either
flavor
is
similar
to
the
nose
advertises
with
grainy
malt
and
a
little
toffee
actually
just
a
bit
of
general
malt
sweetness
there
are
a
bit
of
spicy
hops
but
not
huge
flavor
contribution
i
enjoy
this
beer
but
was
thrown
by
ordering
a
pilsner
and
getting
a
vienna
lager
richer
body
than
i
would
expect
comes
across
like
a
pale
ale
the
hop
is
less
flowery
than
the
czech
versions
of
pils
fairly
typical
malt
base
overall
not
bad
a
nice
easy
drinking
summer
beer
hops
are
an
interesting
character
the
light
dme
like
aroma
and
flavor
takes
away
from
it
a
bit
but
its
not
that
strong
overall
a
disappointment
for
me
this
smelled
so
good
but
the
taste
fell
flat
as
the
flavors
really
just
did
not
mesh
well
i
have
had
lots
better
in
the
style
and
will
pass
on
this
in
the
future
hip
hip
horay
penn
brewery
overall
i
enjoyed
it
and
would
have
it
again
when
in
the
mood
for
a
pilsnerlight
lager
this
beer
pous
a
golden
color
with
a
small
long
lasting
head
the
smell
was
weak
and
watery
the
taste
is
light
and
a
bit
sweet
very
easy
to
drink
and
very
nicely
caronated
could
use
more
flavor
overall
not
bad
could
be
better
like
a
watered
down
sam
adams
o
not
a
bad
beer
by
any
means
not
great
yet
not
subpar
by
any
means
having
lived
in
pittsburgh
for
a
number
of
years
ill
come
back
to
this
one
if
nothing
other
than
supporting
a
pa
brewery
cheers
d
a
good
representation
of
the
style
but
nothing
in
particular
that
would
make
me
come
back
to
it
the
first
taste
is
surprisingly
sweet
and
its
apparent
the
brewers
are
pursuing
a
more
bavarianstyle
pilsner
as
opposed
to
the
paler
and
crisper
bohemian
versions
or
the
drier
northern
german
varieties
with
a
hoppy
hallertau
bite
thats
rather
more
of
a
nibble
this
brew
could
easily
be
considered
a
vienna
lager
rather
than
a
true
pils
still
its
a
very
nice
drinkable
brew
that
would
serve
its
consumer
well
over
the
course
of
an
evening
md
mouthfeel
is
a
itthin
but
not
bad
leaves
a
pleasant
hop
aftertaste
reasonably
drinkable
but
i
think
the
flavor
profile
might
get
to
me
after
a
few
an
amber
viennastyle
lager
beer
that
is
smooth
mellow
and
full
bodied
with
delicate
hop
aroma
a
session
beer
head
and
shoulders
above
most
in
this
style
i
have
this
beer
on
tap
in
my
man
cave
it
is
easy
drinking
great
tasting
and
priced
perfectly
a
must
try
for
someone
who
wants
to
get
into
drinking
craft
brews
d
goes
down
easily
very
tasty
mild
kick
nice
representation
of
style
this
beer
completely
hit
the
spot
one
to
drink
for
a
while
the
original
owner
recently
came
out
of
retirement
and
bought
the
brewery
back
he
was
upset
that
his
labor
of
passion
was
run
into
the
ground
and
eventually
closed
and
contracted
the
brewing
out
of
the
area
well
penn
brewery
is
back
and
is
now
brewing
on
site
again
and
it
shows
this
is
the
penn
brew
we
loved
not
that
other
stuff
that
just
had
their
name
on
it
this
is
what
pennsylvania
german
craft
beer
is
all
about
my
friends
thanks
to
tom
pastorius
for
bringing
traditonal
german
craft
beer
back
to
pittsburgh
try
it
its
a
great
lager

how

it

the
style
on
the
head
even
though
ba
has
called
this
a
vienna
lager
it
is
a
pilsner
prost
this
beer
reinforces
the
fact
that
some
of
americas
best
beer
comes
from
the
beautiful
state
of
pennsylvania
a
total
winner
from
steel
city
drink
it
d
nostalgia
for
me
one
of
if
not
the
first
craft
beer
i
ever
had
did
me
very
well
back
in
my
college
days
this

easy

more
of
a
macro

having
a
clean

crisp

decent
taste
a
nice
crisp
maltiness
and
just
a
slight
bit
of
noble
hoppishness
at
the
end
goes
down
fairly
well
but
a
bit
overcarbonated

my
concern
is
that
i
am
simply
enjoying
this
as
a
first
beer
of
the
evening
and
that
if
i
had
more
maybe
it
wouldnt
still
sit
so
well
its
sitting
well
enough
now
that
i
will
have
to
seek
some
out
another
problem
may
be
finding
this
around
here
dvery
easy
drinking
and
has
big
flavor
for
such
a
low
alcohol
content
beer
definitely
a
great
session
beer
pours

a

fair
amount

aroma
is

malt
and
a
bit
of
citrus

has
a
lingering
aftertaste
that
is
somewhat
grainy
with
a
lingering
sweetness
that
is
offset
by
a
bit
of
hop
bitterness
as
it
warms
a
bit
of
caramel
comes
out
in
the
nose
medium
to
light
feel
with
mild
amount
of
carb
overall
not
bad
i
would
drink
it
again
drinkability
very
sessionable
nothing
that
i
would
seek
out
yet
wouldnt
turn
down
if
i
were
offered
overall
not
the
tastiest
of
all
the
session
beers
i
have
had
but
this
one
is
not
too
bad
definitely
recommended
if
you
just
want
to
kick
back
and
have
a
session
beer
this
isnt
really
a
pilsner
not
as
hoppy
as
most
but
i
still
really
enjoy
this
as
a
fantastic
session
beer
drinkability
high
as
heaven
with
this
one
very
tasty
beer
and
nice
light
body
that
went
well
with
the
food
italian
if
youre
wondering
not
heavy
in
the
least
and
this
would
be
an
easy
beer
to
drink
in
a
session
with
that
really
low
4

smell
is
a
little
skunky
hope
the
taste
can
prevail
pours

lacing
taste
is
malty
and
dry
with
traces
of
bitter
hoppiness
in
the
finish
very
light
and
crisp
yet
flavorful
this
tastes
like
a
distinctly
german
brew
without
a
doubt
good
flavor
for
the
lightness
of
the
style
a
very
refreshing
brew
for
hot
weather
a
high
class
lawnmower
brew
or
a
great
brew
for
bmc
breaking
into
craft
a
tasty
example
of
the
style
d
this
is
certainly
a
vienna
lager
and
not
a
pilsner
strange
to
name
it
a
pilsner
and
then
call
it
a
vienna
on
the
back
label
tastes
sweetly
malty
with
not
quite
enough
hops
in
the
finish
to
make
it
interesting
i
like
it
but
wouldnt
seek
it
out
everything
about
this
beer
just
seems
to
border
on
reminding
me
of
something
horrible
and
disasterous
its
not
bad
but
i
almost
feel
like
something
bad
will
happen
when
i
drink
it
i
could
drink
more
of
these
but
not
going
to
seek
it
out
by
any
means
n
a
nice
beer
could
easily
drink
a
few
of
these
with
friends
notes
i
really
enjoyed
this
sessions
with
this
beer
are
great
and
while
it
states
that
it
is
pilsner
it
is
actually
a
vienna
lager
what
a
good
beer
that
is
so
easy
to
drink
this
is
the
second
penn
beer
ive
had
and
both
had
a
very
strong
mineral
taste
which
i
cannot
stand
d
i
could
pound
these
all
night
if
i
am
drinking
a
pils
its
early
in
the
session
and
it
doesnt
take
long
to
switch
to
a
darker
brew
but
i
could
definately
have
a
few
before
i
thought
about
moving
on
comes
out
of
the
tap
a
clear
golden
yellow
with
a
thick
white
head
aroma
is
crisp
malty
and
quite
inviting
flavor
is
crisp
and
malty
like
a
typical
pilsner
with
a
fruity
undertone
and
more
rounded
out
than
most
pilsners
i
have
tried
texture
is
tingly
lively
and
sassy
i
am
not
a
big
fan
of
pilsners
or
lagers
but
i
did
like
this
one
and
i
recommend
it
to
pilsner
lovers
offering
from
the
beer
of
the
month
club
im
not
usually
a
big
lager
fan
but
this
was
wonderfully
drinkable
poured
a
nice
clear
gold
with
a
foamy
white
head
grains
hit
you
up
front
with
a
sharp
spice
undertone
this
is
a
great
beer
after
mowing
the
lawn
which
i
just
happened
to
do
today
right
before
drinking
im
not
sure
id
buy
these
if
i
was
out
shopping
but
definitely
not
upset
to
have
found
three
of
them
on
my
doorstep
a
very
decent
and
well
made
pils
drank
very
easy
a
vienna
lager
that
matches
most
i
had
over
in
germany
this
pour
was
a
translucent
gold
with
a
small
bit
of
head
the
smell
was
nothing
special
but
certainly
appealing
i
was
expecting
this
to
be
more
hoppy
than
it
was
but
the
hops
taste
was
more
grassy
than
i
was
expecting
and
i
was
pleased
my
big
complaint
is
that
i
could
barely
tell
of
was
drinking
this
beer
i
was
about
halfway
through
that
i
kind
of
wished
i
was
drinking
something
else
it
was
smooth
and
easy
to
drink
however
it
was
a
bit
boring
overall
other
than
the
looks
id
have
to
say
this
is
one
you
might
wanna
pass
on
i
will
say
this
though
i
like
the
photo
of
the
old
man
on
the
label
now
if
only
the
beer
had
that
kind
of
character
d
this
is
a
very
nice
viennastyle
lager
its
clean
and
malty
and
very
well
balanced
its
very
sessionable
also
beer
of
the
month
club
arrival
that
poured
a
goldorange
color
with
a
small
white
head
that
smelled
malty
with
a
whiff
of
orange
malt
and
yeast
flavor
combo
up
front
with
a
crisp
earthy
finish
that
has
a
hint
of
spice
medium
to
heavy
carbonation
makes
it
a
crisp
beer
that
goes
down
smooth
overall
a
bit
dull
but
its
an
ok
to
good
pilsner
based
on
the
slight
spice
taste
after
drinking
3
of
them
i
conclude
its
a
little
boring
for
my
liking
and
i
wouldnt
seek
it
out
at
a
bar
very
drinkable
pretty
refreshing
i
wouldnt
mind
having
a
few
of
these
of
the
may
bom
brews
this
was
my
favorite
poured
into
a
pilsner
glass
this
brew
is
a
golden
wheat
color
with
a
clean
white
head
that
left
no
lacing
but
settled
in
a
nice
cap
the
aroma
is
very
doughy
with
some
sweet
floral
notes
the
taste
is
crisp
and
had
a
bread
taste
but
there
was
a
faint
floral
balance
and
a
mild
bitter
bite
in
the
finish
this
was
moderate
in
body
and
a
little
higher
in
carbonation
all
around
solid
brew
the
taste
was
so
fresh
crisp
and
refreshing
i
wish
i
had
more
to
share
but
the
cost
for
an
extra
12
pack
is
just
too
much
i
guess
i
will
need
to
keep
my
eyes
open
if
in
pennsylvania
maybe
on
the
sweeter
and
darker
side
of
the
pilsner
spectrum
but
definitely
refreshing
recommended
overall
a
simple
easy
drinker
this
beer
has
a
rich
golden
amber
color
with
hues
of
autum
orange
virtually
no
head
or
lace
it
has
a
somewhat
sour
yeasty
smell
not
that
appealing
the
taste
is
very
bready
and
yeasty
with
some
hints
of
carmel
leaves
a
nice
tingling
sensation
throughout
the
mouth
if
find
this
beer
quite
drinkable
pairs
well
with
wings
very
drinkable
this
has
easily
become
one
of
my
favorites
just
wish
it
was
more
available
if
you
like
sa
boston
lager
or
brooklyn
lager
id
say
give
this
one
a
try
doesnt
have
the
same
hop
characteramerican
style
hopping
is
truly
uniquebut
is
much
fresher
than
a
similarstyled
beer
coming
from
germany
not
a
pilsner
so
the
names
stupid
but
just
forget
that
once
you
pour
it
into
a
glass
d
exceedingly
drinkable
definitely
looking
forward
to
these
over
the
summer
fiancee
thinks
its
okay
overall
this
is
really
a
good
beer
just
dont
call
it
a
pilsner
very
sessionable
at
5
d
an
easy
drinking
beer
if
only
because
its
bland
an
average
beer
but
it
misses
the
mark
of
both
a
pilsner
and
vienna
lager
md
not
a
whole
lot
to
this
one
in
my
opinion
i
dont
think
id
search
it
out
again
single
from
whole
foods
raleigh
d
very
enjoyable
lager
would
definitely
make
this
a
goto
beer
good
local
when
looking
for
something
in
the
pilsner
or
vienna
lager
genre
pours
a
clear
dark
yellow
with
a
quickly
receeding
two
finger
soapy
head
and
leaves
some
lace
patches
a
mix
of
grassy
earthy
hops
and
some
sweet
malts
like
caramel
or
honey
this
beer
is
real
smooth
smoother
than
most
pils
ive
had
and
has
a
more
pronounced
hopmalt
balance
good
and
dry
on
the
tongue
with
a
crisp
finish
this
mediumbodied
beer
also
is
a
little
creamy
and
a
tad
sweet
ill
have
this
again
anytime
dvery
drinkable
a
great
session
brew
and
luckily
brewed
20
minutes
from
me
and
always
available
i
like
it
the
us
needs
more
brewers
taking
the
german
styles
and
giving
them
a
twist
like
this
poured
a
medium
brown
small
head
hazy
in
appearance
odd
for
a
pils
not
a
real
strong
presence
of
anything
to
me
in
the
aroma
of
this
beer
hoppy
grassy
and
a
light
hint
of
sweet
apple
i
dont
know
if
its
because
its
10
am
in
the
morning
but
i
smell
an
undertone
of
bready
guinness
in
this
one
for
some
reason
tasted
bread
notes
grainy
and
malty
started
out
a
little
sweet
and
finishes
a
little
bitter
nothing
outstanding
in
the
taste
either
mouthfeel
is
thin
and
light
drinkability
is
pretty
average
to
me
overall
not
a
bad
brew
for
something
from
my
own
state
d
another
solid
offering
from
penn
pa
should
be
proud
to
have
a
well
rounded
classic
style
brewer
like
this
sharing
its
name
dont
go
too
far
out
of
your
way
for
this
one
but
if
your
in
western
pa
pick
one
up
my
brother
and
sisterinlaw
brought
back
a
bottle
of
this
from
brewery
decanted
into
a
pilsner
glass
pours
a
clear
orangish
color
with
a
thin
white
head
good
clean
smells
and
tastes
a
bit
biscuity
kind
of
your
standard
pilsner
loose
mouthfeel
a
little
bit
of
fizz
overall
good
although
not
exceptional
poured
this
into
a
12
oz
glass
from
a
12
oz
bottle
the
color
is
a
light
to
medium
straw
color
with
some
visible
carbonation
and
a
small
amount
of
head
that
disipates
quickly
the
taste
and
smell
are
rather
bland
some
hops
are
evident
but
not
much
else
theres
a
nice
crisp
taste
to
this
beer
nothing
spectacular
but
its
a
decent
beer
its
not
my
favorite
so
i
cant
see
keeping
it
on
hand
except
that
it
comes
as
part
of
the
brewerys
gourmet
selection
hey
its
a
good
lawnmowing
brew
could
drink
this
often
this
particular
one
was
a
little
on
the
flat
side
but
not
a
bad
drink
overall
not
a
bad
pick
not
a
champion
but
not
bad
not
bad
but
wouldnt
be
my
pick
for
a
nice
pils
to
drink
on
a
warm
day
golden
colored
smallish
head
but
some
nice
lacing
is
produced
the
flavor
is
sweet
fruits
with
some
grassy
notes
mild
hops
but
they
are
sweet
and
the
whole
flavor
seems
just
a
little
too
sweet
decent
mouthfeel
but
not
as
crisp
as
id
like
a
pils
to
be
its
quite
drinkable
but
no
better
than
average
this
is
a
well
made
beer
with
enough
flavor
and
character
to
satisfy
another
note
on
this
brew
is
the
resemblence
it
has
to
its
european
brethren
this
tastes
like
something
coming
from
europe
not
the
states
recommended
poured
into
a
plastic
cup
but
a
amberish
deep
copper
good
looking
beer
big
head
with
lots
of
lace
smells
sweet
and
the
taste
backs
that
up
sweet
malts
upfront
with
an
earth
graininessis
that
a
wordwith
a
sweet
aftertaste
mouthfeel
is
creamy
and
crisp
nice
tasty
beer
that
goes
down
well
at
the
baseball
game
drinkability
very
easy
to
drink
lager
and
much
better
than
the
usual
macro
offerings
worth
picking
some
of
this
up
for
some
easy
to
drink
beer
pours
a
crisp
dark
yellow
with
a
thin
head
that
diminishes
to
nothing
the
aroma
is
a
very
weak
trace
of
sweet
malts
and
citrus
hops
the
taste
is
a
nice
jump
up
from
the
aroma
nice
sweetness
with
a
decent
hop
balance
that
leaves
a
nice
lingering
finish
the
beer
is
very
light
and
crisp
a
refreshing
summer
beer
this
is
an
enjoyable
beer
but
id
have
to
be
in
the
mood
for
the
style
to
try
it
again
drinkability
very
tasty
beer
good
summer
beer
nicely
drinkable
due
to
balane
a
solid
brew
d
this
is
definitely
a
beer
i
try
to
find
at
the
stadium
checking
out
the
pirates
trying
to
support
the
local
guys
good
in
the
summertime
pours
a
clear
golden
hue
with
a
full
one
finger
white
fluffy
head
that
sticks
around
for
a
while
nice
creamy
lacing
is
left
on
the
sides
of
the
glass
as
the
cloudy
foam
dies
down
to
a
thin
layer
continuous
bubbles
rise
to
the
top
throughout
the
entire
tasting
smell
is
pretty
sugary
a
good
amount
of
grain
malt
and
honey
a
bit
of
freshly
cut
summer
grass
in
the
nose
as
well
overall
pretty
sweet
aroma
toasted
grains
on
the
tongue
up
front
followed
by
more
of
that
sweet
malty
goodness
a
minor
metallic
flavor
is
hidden
underneath
all
the
sweetness
which
i
could
do
without
aftertaste
is
a
bit
watery
with
a
hay
like
flavor
medium
body
with
a
creamy
feel
and
steady
carbonation
pleasing
to
the
mouth
a
bit
too
sweet
for
me
but
still
very
refreshing
definitely
worth
a
shot
especially
with
summer
approaching
a
very
fresh
herbal
smell
with
a
taste
that
is
very
consistent
more
body
and
flavor
than
a
macro
pilsner
but
just
as
drinkable
cold
on
a
spring
or
summer
day
have
come
to
prefer
their
dark
st
nicholas
bock
marzen
and
my
favorite
their
weizen
but
this
is
a
very
nice
goto
beer
for
company
who
might
want
an
alternative
from
the
standard
crap
light
very
nice
after
grass
cutting
easy
to
find
in
western
pa
final
thought
an
excellent
example
of
a
german
pils
that
is
considered
a
vienna
lager
but
hey
its
all
good
this
is
a
very
solid
brew
very
sessionable
not
in
the
same
league
as
some
other
viennas
like
great
lakes
eliot
ness
but
very
good
in
its
own
right
d
it
is
a
little
light
for
the
style
i
think
but
enough
flavor
to
make
it
enjoyalbe
because
of
its
mellowness
this
goes
down
quite
easily
i
probably
would
not
buy
this
again
if
faced
with
sam
or
this
i
would
likely
take
the
sam
mouthfeel
is
not
too
heavy
a
little
slick
overall
this
is
a
relatively
nice
brew
could
go
through
a
few
of
these
pretty
quickly
and
easily
wont
overwhelm
your
palate
if
you
pair
it
with
food
no
idea
how
much
a
6
goes
for
as
i
picked
this
up
as
a
single
but
yah
nice
brew
pennsylvania
brewing
company
penn
pilsner
pours
a
clear
golden
yellow
typical
of
light
lagers
smell
is
ever
so
slightly
malted
but
mostly
nothing
aromas
given
off
are
similar
to
that
of
a
german
style
lager
the
taste
is
as
well
but
its
watered
down
and
on
the
weak
side
with
not
a
whole
lot
to
offer
mouthfeel
for
the
best
part
is
light
and
smooth
but
it
is
also
thin
and
watery
drinability
is
fair
at
best
its
easy
to
choke
down
but
its
lack
of
everything
makes
it
rather
dull
overall
a
very
easy
drinking
basic
quality
craft
beer
great
beer
to
drink
in
the
spring
and
summer
months
this
beer
poured
a
nice
golden
straw
color
with
a
huge
fluffy
white
head
which
dissaptes
fairly
slowly
the
aroma
is
of
citrus
and
bread
not
much
hops
detected
the
taste
was
a
bit
metallic
but
not
so
as
to
be
offputting
the
taste
was
light
not
too
much
flavor
to
it
but
it
is
a
drinkable
beer
very
refreshing
on
a
hot
day
the
mouthfeel
was
medium
body
with
mediumhigh
carbonation
overall
not
a
bad
brew
just
tried
this
last
weekend
and
i
like
it
pours
a
nice
medium
yellow
with
touch
of
grain
in
the
smellkind
of
toasty
grain
pours
with
about
34
inch
head
light
lacing
in
the
glass
mouth
feel
is
very
nice
as
soon
as
i
had
one
i
ended
up
having
3
a
very
flavorful
drinkable
pilsner
in
the
old
style
i
have
to
say
for
the
price
not
cheap
but
they
have
hit
a
home
run
on
this
one
i
will
go
back
for
more
in
the
very
near
future
this
is
one
very
drinkable
beer
nothing
special
but
not
a
bad
beer
poured
a
little
darker
than
most
pilsners
but
still
had
the
grainy
nose
and
taste
of
pilsners
medium
bodied
with
a
short
finish
pretty
much
a
soso
beer
unfortunately
this
is
another
one
of
those
pilsners
that
would
be
okay
if
served
very
cold
on
a
hiot
summer
day
but
one
to
be
avoided
if
looking
for
an
enjoyable
sipping
beer
d
overall
this
is
just
an
average
beer
it
has
more
taste
than
a
macro
but
not
by
much
pours
a
very
chillhazed
dark
straw
color
with
a
soon
to
fall
quarter
inch
of
head
aromas
are
just
dominated
by
a
barely
colored
malt
with
an
overall
grainy
sense
i
believe
there
is
some
slight
skunking
in
this
bottle
having
tried
sa
imp
pils
i
know
what
hallertaus
should
taste
like
and
this
one
doesnt
give
too
much
of
the
flavor
or
aroma
of
them
a
medium
light
bodied
lager
this
one
has
just
a
touch
of
sweetness
with
the
lightly
toasted
malts
taking
over
i
really
am
missing
much
of
hallertaus
delicate
floral
flavor
in
this
bottle
hopefully
it
is
not
too
old
a
crisp
and
dry
lager
nice
for
the
summer
but
one
i
will
probably
not
revisit
the
beer
was
an
amber
color
it
seemed
a
little
dark
to
me
for
a
pilsner
i
heard
the
beer
was
a
good
one
and
overall
i
was
not
disappointed
i
liked
the
taste
it
had
a
good
hop
character
and
clean
taste
it
wasnt
very
heavy
and
i
felt
like
i
could
have
several
if
i
had
been
so
inclined
without
getting
filled
up
golden
in
appearance
with
a
one
inch
head
served
in
a
pilsner
glass
slight
toasty
smell
with
a
hint
of
grains
the
first
taste
was
refreshing
and
a
slight
tart
taste
and
a
hint
of
lemon
a
drinkable
beer
a
good
pilsner
that
sticks
to
the
glass
and
palate
really
enjoy
this
offering
from
a
beer
of
the
month
club
thank
the
wife
for
that
d
this
beer
has
a
nice
full
flavor
for
a
pilsner
and
good
depth
yet
still
subtle
i
was
shocked
at
how
quaftable
this
beer
was
d
pretty
good
id
wager
im
not
the
hugest
pils
fan
but
this
going
down
rather
nicely
and
i
look
forward
to
drinking
the
others
worth
a
shot
and
this
is
coming
from
a
total
hophead
this
is
a
good
thirstquenching
beer
and
a
great
choice
for
an
everyday
brew
that
doesnt
blow
you
away
with
powerful
flavors
overall
a
great
beer
with
a
lot
of
flavor
for
this
style
pours
a
cloudy
amber
with
a
decent
off
white
head
that
does
not
really
stick
around
too
long
nose
is
a
bit
woody
with
a
slight
perfume
to
it
flavor
is
much
more
robust
than
i
was
expecting
thick
tree
character
with
a
stringent
sweet
edge
that
has
an
overall
thick
caramel
tone
to
it
feel
is
smooth
on
the
liquid
with
a
fairly
low
carbonation
very
drinkable
a
very
well
made
brew
with
a
lot
of
body
and
character
to
it
definitely
worth
a
try
d
could
be
my
new
summer
beer
drinkable
no
chuggable
i
think
theres
some
identity
confusion
between
the
pilsner
on
the
label
and
actual
style
but
its
still
a
good
beer
regardless
it
doesnt
have
the
rich
caramel
malt
of
a
sa
boston
lager
but
theres
still
a
smooth
sweetness
with
a
touch
of
esters
a
crisp
grassy
hops
note
finishes
out
the
beer
to
make
it
a
nice
clean
lager
with
character
after
the
smell
test
i
was
concerned
that
penn
pilsner
would
be
nothing
more
than
another
forgettable
eurostyle
lager
its
much
more
than
that
though
its
a
very
good
example
of
a
style
that
too
few
american
craft
brewers
will
tackle
even
though
ive
only
had
two
beers
from
these
guys
st
nick
bock
im
mightily
impressed
so
far
i
poured
the
12oz
bottle
in
to
a
pint
glass
and
it
had
a
ordinary
appearance
for
the
style
i
believe
it
was
a
light
gold
color
the
smell
was
pretty
much
of
adjuncts
like
corn
it
was
a
good
crisp
smell
the
taste
pretty
much
followed
suite
with
the
smell
it
had
sort
of
a
corn
laced
taste
but
was
crisp
and
refreshing
hit
the
spot
so
to
speak
there
was
barely
any
head
i
dont
know
enough
yet
to
know
if
there
should
be
for
this
style
it
felt
great
in
the
mouth
and
i
feel
would
be
a
good
summertime
beer
it
was
pretty
drinkable
because
it
wasnt
too
heavy
in
the
mouth
or
stomach
i
would
very
much
get
this
again
if
i
am
ever
in
pittsburgh
again
to
visit
the
brewery
or
can
find
it
somewhere
here
in
ohio
this
is
an
extremely
drinkable
light
version
of
a
vienna
lager
which
leads
me
to
question
the
name
penn
pilsner
even
the
brewery
website
describes
the
beer
as
a
vienna
lager
in
any
event
i
quality
lager
i
highly
recommend
despite
the
lightness
of
the
beer
the
taste
is
complex
and
remains
appealing
very
clear
and
dark
gold
with
a
short
cap
of
fine
white
foam
good
head
retention
with
lots
of
lacing
that
showed
some
stickage
big
hop
aroma
mostly
floral
and
a
bit
sulfury
with
a
mild
grainy
malt
quality
the
flavour
was
quite
malty
but
not
overly
sweet
with
a
low
solid
bitterness
some
grain
character
with
faint
caramel
and
spicyfloral
hops
fairly
dry
with
a
light
body
and
moderate
carbonation
a
decent
lager
though
it
misses
the
mark
for
a
pilsner
and
a
decent
summer
beer
d
reasonable
its
not
as
refreshing
as
other
pilsners
ive
tried
i
could
have
a
couple
in
a
session
if
i
wanted
to
but
i
wont
stock
my
fridge
with
them
nice
dark
redorange
color
no
head
or
lacing
to
speak
of
some
sediment
floating
around
not
sure
what
that
is
taste
is
very
smooth
fairly
light
and
decent
flavor
drinkability
is
prob
pretty
high
with
this
being
that
its
pretty
light
very
malty
caramelly
and
yeasty
not
a
bad
brew
but
i
think
i
like
the
penn
dark
better
although
thats
light
too
for
a
dark
beer
but
its
good
id
recommend
penns
brews
they
seem
to
do
a
quality
job
just
not
sure
why
the
pilsner
is
brewed
out
of
state
and
not
in
the
burgh
like
the
rest
good
stuff
penn
bottoms
up
my
friends
served
in
a
snifter
the
beer
pours
a
clear
bright
goldorange
color
with
a
half
inch
white
head
which
goes
away
very
quickly
it
smells
like
grassy
hops
sweet
malt
and
some
breadgrain
overall
the
aroma
is
light
but
clean
it
tastes
like
toasted
malt
grassy
hops
and
bread
with
a
slight
bitter
aftertaste
mouthfeel
is
lightmedium
and
its
crisp
and
smooth
drinkability
is
good
it
goes
down
easy
and
it
wouldnt
be
hard
to
drink
a
few
of
these
at
a
time
overall
i
think
this
is
a
decent
beer
good
and
easy
drinking
dont
drink
and
review
d
this
was
pretty
good
overall
id
session
it
if
it
was
the
best
choice
available
my
least
favorite
of
the
penn
brews
that
i
have
had
so
far
and
it
happens
to
be
their
flagship
go
figure
its
a
decent
pils
but
i
probably
wont
have
it
again
being
that
i
like
thier
other
brews
so
much
a
nice
german
pilsner
all
in
all
and
a
another
good
beer
by
the
pittsburgh
brewery
sean
its
lightbodied
but
got
some
depth
and
complexity
very
drinkable
solid
a
fairly
light
mouthfeeltangy
with
some
slight
cloying
very
easy
drinking
could
drink
this
beer
all
summer
long
very
good
summer
session
beer
could
keep
this
beer
on
tap
all
summer
long
all
penn
beers
taste
best
when
fresh
and
on
tap
this
is
a
very
good
beer
the
consistency
once
was
a
problem
but
with
more
in
house
brewing
this
beer
seems
to
taste
good
every
pour
not
really
a
pilsner
not
really
a
vienna
but
a
very
good
lager
a
little
bit
sweet
but
very
easy
to
drink
more
than
one
highly
recommended
when
in
pittsburgh
this
beer
pours
a
bright
deep
gold
has
an
inch
thick
bubbly
head
that
dissipated
rather
quickly
with
a
little
bit
of
lace
the
aroma
is
of
light
spicy
hops
with
some
fruity
undertones
the
malty
aroma
is
in
the
background
and
comes
through
in
the
flavor
it
balances
nicely
with
the
hop
flavors
there
are
some
light
dms
flavors
in
the
middle
but
they
are
only
light
the
mouth
feel
is
light
and
crisp
but
it
has
a
rather
salty
feel
to
it
overall
its
a
rather
drinkable
beer
but
not
outstanding
from
the
beer
of
the
month
club
12
oz
bottle
the
beer
pours
a
clear
golden
yellow
with
a
white
head
and
slick
lacing
the
aroma
is
full
hop
sweet
malt
and
earth
the
taste
is
smooth
and
malty
with
a
light
body
and
crisp
clean
finish
very
drinkable
and
clean
pilsner
oelergud
pours
light
golden
low
carbonation
with
a
thin
white
head
smells
slightly
of
toasted
caramel
has
a
mild
tart
start
and
a
malt
finish
smooth
and
tasty
a
good
session
beer
and
good
staple
to
come
back
to
not
a
true
pilsner
but
hey
whos
counting
d
a
very
good
beer
which
could
and
no
doubt
will
be
enjoyed
all
night
this
bottle
was
a
gift
from
friend
paul
b
poured
with
a
nice
head
that
soon
faded
no
lace
has
a
hazy
amber
color
nose
was
sweet
bready
caramel
malt
flavor
is
a
bit
tart
however
maybe
from
the
carbonation
shallow
beer
not
at
all
a
pilsner
the
finish
is
the
sensation
of
the
carbonation
on
the
tongue
and
not
much
else
pours
a
transparent
copper
color
with
a
shortlived
white
head
aroma
consists
of
mild
fruit
notes
with
a
touch
of
the
hops
not
much
else
there
taste
begins
with
some
slight
hop
bitterness
with
a
hint
of
orange
peel
and
finishes
with
a
bread
cereal
like
grain
character
that
lingers
for
a
bit
light
bodied
carbonation
might
be
too
much
but
doesnt
hurt
its
drinkability
goes
down
the
hatch
very
easy
not
exactly
a
benchmark
for
the
style
but
it
is
a
quality
beer
in
its
own
right
and
is
very
much
available
in
the
surrounding
areas
excellent
a
fine
beer
refreshing
sessionable
not
going
to
blow
your
mind
with
flavor
or
abv
but
a
pleasure
to
drink
i
think
this
is
going
to
start
me
exploring
this
category
again
pours
a
nice
thick
white
head
carries
some
decent
lacing
down
the
glass
smell
very
average
as
are
most
of
penns
beers
but
it
tastes
of
slight
twingy
hops
and
a
very
malty
sweet
front
very
easy
to
drink
six
can
probably
be
consumed
in
a
short
period
of
time
a
very
nice
session
beer
poured
cloudy
gold
in
the
glass
with
a
small
foamy
head
that
went
quickly
leaving
a
fairly
flat
foamless
top
not
much
in
the
way
of
visible
carbonation
cloudy
but
definitely
there
in
the
moderately
thin
mouthfeel
smell
is
mild
malt
with
a
touch
of
fruity
hops
taste
is
the
same
but
with
a
somewhat
pleasant
tartness
that
is
really
unique
if
a
true
germanstyle
pils
incredibly
fresh
taste
and
oh
so
smooth
that
it
goes
down
with
food
or
as
a
session
drink
in
this
case
its
lack
of
complexity
is
actually
a
benefit
as
you
can
really
enjoy
the
drink
i
bought
a
whole
case
had
to
its
pa
a
month
ago
and
have
been
enjoying
it
ever
since
as
penns
brews
go
this
is
one
of
the
least
flavorful
and
yet
its
great
draught
this
one
pours
a
slightly
dark
mostly
clear
golden
color
mine
had
very
little
head
and
only
a
little
bit
of
lacing
the
aroma
was
a
bit
lighter
there
were
some
notes
of
sweetness
otherwise
fairly
nondescript
the
taste
was
ok
a
decent
beer
but
not
a
true
pilsner
some
malts
a
hair
bitter
not
a
bad
session
beer
but
nothing
special
12oz
bottle
clear
clean
dark
golden
color
with
small
white
head
leaving
spotty
lacing
around
the
glass
smells
of
malt
and
a
faint
of
scent
hops
taste
of
light
caramel
malts
and
a
bit
of
a
hop
bite
feels
crisp
clean
and
refreshing
and
is
very
drinkable
an
easy
beer
to
turn
to
when
your
in
the
mood
for
something
light
and
thirst
quenching
tried
this
one
again
it
is
growing
on
me
stats
have
been
adjusted
accordingly
i
found
this
bottle
to
be
fullflavored
and
delicious
pretty
looking
pour
as
well
pours
a
light
honey
amber
with
a
foamy
head
that
dissipates
quickly
slight
lacing
good
carbonation
smells
of
funky
malts
and
hops
smells
like
a
pilsner
taste
is
pretty
well
balanced
slightly
hoppy
yet
refreshing
as
well
as
having
some
actual
malty
body
which
poor
pilsners
seem
to
lack
overall
a
pretty
decent
pilsner
d
the
beer
is
very
drinkable
the
moderate
abv
and
sweet
malt
flavors
allow
you
to
have
a
few
beer
poured
a
golden
color
with
a
nice
white
head
that
is
hanging
around
i
am
detecting
sweet
and
sour
notes
from
the
boquet
which
i
did
not
expect
taste
is
malty
and
finishes
with
a
nice
crisp
hop
but
not
overwhelmingly
hoppy
mouthfeel
finishes
crisp
and
clean
it
is
medium
bodied
and
well
carbonated
overall
drinkability
is
good
i
am
impressed
with
this
brewery
and
will
seek
them
out
if
in
the
western
pa
area
in
the
future
the
drinkability
as
aok
one
fine
and
fresh
example
of
a
difficult
beer
to
brew
right
prosit
mk
dgood
ill
enjoy
the
other
two
i
received
easy
drinking
but
a
different
pilsner
in
my
opinion
perhaps
because
it
is
classified
as
a
vienna
lager
the
pour
into
my
prima
pils
glass
raises
a
twofinger
offwhite
head
slow
to
fall
the
lacing
is
sudsy
but
sticky
the
body
is
too
hazy
for
a
pils
and
in
fact
i
see
it
labeled
here
as
a
vienna
lager
i
dont
see
it
to
be
dark
enough
for
that
either
despite
their
websites
claims
its
a
barely
transparent
dark
gold
the
nose
is
actually
quite
weak
with
only
a
slight
sweet
grain
aroma
the
taste
is
close
to
what
i
expect
from
a
dortmunder
with
less
pronounced
hop
taste
but
more
body
and
kick
than
a
helles
theres
really
not
much
to
it
the
mouth
is
somewhat
thick
and
the
carbonation
is
tingly
this
is
indeed
easy
to
drink
but
im
glad
this
is
my
last
bottle
since
theres
not
much
going
for
it
and
the
beer
has
something
of
an
identity
crisis
pours
a
golden
yelloworange
color
with
white
head
that
quickly
turns
into
a
thin
lace
aroma
is
faint
with
sweet
malt
and
caramel
smooth
and
malty
taste
that
finishes
with
a
dry
hop
bitterness
overall
this
is
a
pretty
decent
brew
but
lacks
anything
to
make
it
stand
out
drinkability
overall
not
bad
but
the
finish
detracts
from
what
would
otherwise
be
a
decent
session
beer
on
draught
at
heinz
field
amber
color
with
a
medium
thin
beige
head
with
decent
retention
cannot
comment
on
lacing
as
it
was
a
plastic
cup
lightly
malty
aroma
mediumbodied
and
sweet
with
malt
and
caramel
flavors
there
is
a
touch
of
hops
character
too
the
finish
is
mostly
sweet
but
has
touches
of
bitterness
here
and
there
pretty
average
all
around
this
beer
poured
from
the
bottle
came
out
a
nice
dark
golden
color
some
orange
tint
it
produced
next
to
no
head
with
next
to
no
retention
with
next
to
no
lacing
it
gave
off
a
decent
smell
with
good
malt
and
some
sweet
caramel
aromas
the
taste
was
ok
but
somewhat
below
average
i
thought
of
the
style
again
some
roasted
malt
with
lightly
sweet
undertones
mouthfeel
seemed
somewhat
syrupy
mild
carbonation
overall
it
was
ok
but
probably
the
worst
beer
i
had
from
pennsylvania
brewing
which
produces
some
otherwise
really
good
beers
prost
overall
not
the
greatest
example
of
the
style
certainly
drinkable
but
there
are
better
out
there
this
is
not
a
pilsner
it
looks
and
tastes
like
a
weak
amber
lager
even
for
that
style
this
beer
does
nothing
for
me
this
is
an
orange
pilsner
with
a
thin
bubbly
head
the
nose
is
quite
floral
with
generous
helpings
of
biscuit
and
fresh
bread
aromas
the
beer
tastes
very
clean
with
citrus
and
date
flavors
the
carbonation
is
fairly
low
and
the
mouthfeel
is
crisp
drinkability
is
good
this
goes
well
with
light
vegetarian
fare
overall
curiously
listed
as
a
vienna
lager
and
called
a
pilsner
darker
and
maltier
than
most
it
seems
to
fall
between
the
two
styles
aside
i
just
found
this
to
be
soso
with
a
finish
that
was
mucky
as
say
in
yorkshire
a
medium
bodied
vienna
with
a
dry
and
sweet
finish
now
knowing
the
style
as
a
vienna
i
understand
its
malty
aroma
and
malty
taste
satisfying
not
offensive
nor
interesting
corn
and
carmel
too
a
macro
brew
replacement
apparently
not
made
by
the
brewery
an
easy
session
ale
but
pretty
forgettable
for
flavor
cheers
penn
pilsner
pours
a
yellow
color
with
a
nice
white
head
from
a
brown
twelve
ounce
bottle
the
aroma
is
somewhat
hoppy
with
a
bit
of
sweetness
the
taste
is
nicely
hoppy
but
not
overpowering
it
doesnt
hit
you
over
the
head
and
steal
your
wallet
like
some
of
the
double
ipas
out
there
do
there
is
a
bit
of
sweetness
but
it
finishes
with
hops
so
it
doesnt
seem
too
sweet
nice
sessionable
pilsner
worth
a
try
it
looks
good
before
the
head
disappears
but
its
too
dark
to
be
a
pilsner
it
smells
nice
but
its
too
sweet
and
bready
to
be
a
pilsner
the
taste
its
a
vienna
lager
with
all
of
the
malty
toffee
and
caramel
flavor
that
youd
expect
from
sam
adams
boston
lager
and
the
like
i
was
expecting
and
looking
forward
to
the
crisp
spicy
hop
flavor
profile
of
a
pilsner
so
im
disappointed
but
a
solid
vienna
lager
for
4
is
still
worthwhile
another
fine
traditional
germanstyle
beer
from
penn
brewing
yeah
my
chili
is
goood
not
too
great
of
a
beer
will
drink
again
but
only
because
there
are
4
left
in
the
pack
drinkability
a
solid
pils
and
one
ill
definitely
drink
again
im
sure
there
are
better
out
there
but
for
a
pretty
tasty
session
beer
when
you
dont
want
something
super
complex
this
is
definitely
good
for
that
notes
not
for
me
thats
for
sure
i
love
a
good
pils
but
this
one
falls
a
few
yards
short
poured
a
clear
light
brown
color
with
a
1
inch
head
of
white
foam
and
plenty
of
carbonation
bubbles
through
out
the
entire
pilsner
glass
there
wasnt
much
of
an
aroma
with
this
one
mostly
some
sour
hops
and
with
little
malt
in
the
background
not
too
pleasant
the
taste
was
like
the
smell
except
it
wasnt
sour
mostly
hops
with
just
a
little
malt
in
the
background
the
mouthfeel
was
a
bit
too
watery
and
thin
there
also
some
bitter
hops
in
the
aftertaste
it
did
make
for
a
nice
above
average
pilsner
beer
but
it
isnt
my
favorite
from
penn
brewery
had
it
in
a
pils
glass
was
a
clear
honey
color
leaning
towards
golden
with
a
finger
of
good
white
head
the
bouquet
was
biscuity
and
on
the
grain
side
which
is
a
good
seguey
to
the
taste
that
of
toast
and
bread
crust
on
the
dry
side
good
balance
and
carbonation
on
the
crisp
side
i
wasnt
wowed
but
the
brew
was
good
im
new
to
the
pils
style
so
ill
revisit
this
brew
after
i
have
more
of
the
style
under
my
belt
cheers
i
would
get
this
again
im
not
sure
its
in
the
right
style
i
think
it
should
be
a
vienna
its
pretty
damn
good
whatever
it
is
an
ok
drinkable
beer
but
this
did
not
wow
me

at

nice
drinkable
beer
as
a
friend
of
mine
said
its
yuengling
lager
without
the
skunk
drinkability
i
have
had
this
in
bottle
before
and
i
didnt
remember
this
being
so
malty
i
think
its
so
malty
that
it
really
doesnt
taste
like
a
pilsner
more
of
an
american
lager
still
it
was
enjoyable
and
very
drinkable
but
i
did
have
to
dock
it
some
points
for
not
being
a
good
representation
of
the
style
12
ouncer
sampled
no
freshness
dating
to
be
found
pours
cloudy
orangy
amber
with
a
white
head
leaving
nice
fine
lacing
nose
is
of
slightly
burnt
crayons
not
all
that
fond
of
this
one
lacks
the
typical
clean
crisp
hopping
of
the
finer
pilsners
that
ive
come
to
enjoy
this
is
mostly
malty
thru
the
midsection
and
not
as
snappy
in
the
finish
as
would
be
expected
from
the
top
notch
examples
of
the
style
prima
pils
i
agree
would
be
the
choice
of
pennsylvania
pilsners
smooth
for
a
pilsner
more
malt
than
hops
with
a
theres
that
word
again
surprising
caramel
peak
right
on
the
tongue
which
slides
into
a
slightly
more
hops
than
malt
finish
this
was
well
that
word
for
a
pilsner
not
bitter
at
all
very
drinkable
this
could
easily
be
mistaken
for
a
lager
in
a
blind
test
while
not
spectacular
or
a
roller
coaster
ride
of
taste
its
certainly
better
than
everything
else
that
was
on
tap
here
in
pa
with
the
possible
exception
of
yuengling
certainly
worth
a
try
a
small
foamy
head
is
produced
from
pouring
this
dark
golden
almost
amber
beer
the
smell
is
light
malt
and
a
hint
of
hops
with
a
sort
of
metaloily
aroma
lurking
in
the
background
the
taste
is
malty
reminiscent
of
corn
and
yields
to
light
hopping
with
slight
spice
in
the
back
this
beer
sits
well
on
the
tongue
but
might
be
a
bit
too
watery
however
i
say
that
about
a
lot
of
beers
i
mean
water
is
the
main
ingredient
in
beer
so
anyway
this
was
a
good
beer
but
for
a
pilsner
it
lacked
the
sharper
hops
quality
i
have
come
to
expect
id
have
a
prima
pils
before
this
one
no
contest
taste
is
similarly
plain
rather
common
malt
flavor
and
placid
flavors
doesnt
completely
turn
me
off
but
its
nothing
too
intersting
a
seeming
lack
of
bitterness
leaves
crispness
a
preferred
attribute
in
pils
missing
its
not
bad
but
just
not
very
good
thanks

probably
not

i

in

of
hop
bitterness
sweet
bready
taste
that
might
be
overly
cloying
were
it
not
for
hoppy
flavors
that
balance
the
malts
throughout
uncommonly
thick
smooth
texture
is
a
real
treat
and
makes
this
a
very
drinkable
pilsner
when
poured
into
a
pilsner
glass
you
can
really
get
a
look
at
the
rich
golden
color
this
beer
is
an
easy
drink
with
a
good
aftertaste
unfortunately
i
have
to
cross
the
border
to
pa
because
they
do
not
sell
this
beer
in
my
hometown
one
of
my
regulars
had
on
tap
at
brunos
in
indiana
pa
pours
a
clear
amber
with
little
to
no
head
smells
very
balanced
with
nothing
but
malts
and
hops
taste
quite
bready
and
malty
at
first
with
the
hops
shining
through
at
the
end
on
tap
it
tastes
much
hoppier
than
out
of
the
bottle
the
carbonation
is
great
got
a
little
bored
with
the
brew
near
the
bottom
of
the
glass
overall
this
is
a
nice
pilsner
a
little
above
average
but
nothing
complex
or
special
this
has
long
been
one
of
my
favorites
its
what
i
used
to
keep
in
the
fridge
all
the
time
i
took
a
little
break
from
it
though
and
just
had
one
on
tap
and
am
rating
it
for
the
first
time
the
appearance
in
good
a
little
more
amber
color
than
a
pilsner
usually
is
but
it
just
looks
delicious
in
the
glass
the
smell
is
staightforward
malt
and
hops
taste
is
outstanding
perfect
balance
to
my
taste
bready
malt
flavor
balanced
nicely
with
hops
that
are
not
overpowering
bitter
or
dry
just
right
mouthfeel
is
good
not
thin
not
thick
carbonation
is
right
on
very
very
very
drinkable
i
will
be
buying
a
case
of
the
bottles
very
soon
easy
to
drink
this
is
a
very
good
pils
allinall
a
very
nice
beer
pours
a
deep
golden
pilsener
color
with
a
big
thicket
of
offwhite
colored
head
bready
biscuity
and
grainy
pilsener
malt
profile
with
a
bit
of
florallike
hops
thrown
in
to
balance
tastes
mostly
malty
sweet
with
a
small
hop
finish
that
is
pretty
crisp
good
for
a
u
s
brewed
german
style
pils
but
pretty
average
when
compared
to
its
european
counterparts
enjoyable
this
is
a
very
drinkable
brew
and
id
certainly
recommend
it
id
have
given
a
higher
ranking
for
both
taste
and
mouthfeel
but
i
felt
i
had
to
deduct
points
for
deviating
from
the
style
when
i
drink
a
pilsner
i
expect
a
more
carbonated
lightbodied
beer
with
a
pretty
light
taste
and
a
crisp
finish
if
you
had
handed
me
an
unmarked
glass
of
this
brew
i
would
have
guessed
it
was
an
amber
ale
and
would
have
said
lots
of
very
complimentary
things
about
it
its
a
complex
wellbalanced
brew
but
its
not
what
im
looking
for
when
i
open
up
a
pilsner
drinkability
a
good
beer
that
could
be
enjoyed
on
any
occasion
this
beer
and
its
advertizements
seem
to
be
everywhere
in
pittsburgh
on
a
recent
trip
i
had
pleanty
of
bottles
and
was
suprized
at
how
drinkable
the
beer
is
its
golden
and
clear
with
a
thick
bubbly
head
moderate
carbonation
and
a
nice
flowery
hop
aroma
its
initially
sweeth
and
malty
with
little
breadiness
very
soft
and
extremely
drinkable
i
didnt
expect
much
but
the
beer
was
fantastic
dn
a
very
nice
beer
from
a
local
to
me
at
least
brewery
alcohol
level
isnt
too
high
smells
and
flavor
are
very
nice
id
recommend
this
one
pours
a
clear
medium
gold
with
a
one
inch
beige
head
that
has
good
retention
sheets
of
lacing
follow
nice
aroma
of
sweet
caramel
malt
lemony
ctrus
and
a
touch
of
pine
taste
is
extremely
pleasant
the
sweet
malt
backbone
is
well
balanced
by
the
bittering
and
aromatic
hallertau
hops
which
lend
considerable
bittering
this
one
finishes
clean
and
dry
this
may
be
the
best
pilsner
ive
ever
sampled
certainly
the
best
american
pilsner
ive
had
this
is
only
my
second
brew
from
penn
but
ive
been
very
impressed
with
the
quality
of
these
pittsburgh
brews
pretty
good
pilsner
maybe
a
tad
too
sweet
kind
of
boring
but
not
offensive
not
an
everyday
beer
but
interesting
to
try
pours
a
darker
goldendarker
than
most
pilsners
i
have
hadaroma
is
malty
and
bready
not
to
sweet
taste
is
a
nice
malt
accented
crisp
as
a
cracker
with
some
zesty
hop
in
there
but
this
more
of
crispdry
malt
accented
brew
a
little
more
heavy
i
thought
than
most
of
the
style
but
still
a
appetizing
beer
none
the

prosit
how
sad
is
that

with
light

as

a

this

highly
drinkable

one
of
my
staple
beers
a
good
beer
for

drinking
medium
amber
color
small
head
aroma
is
malty
and
slightly
sweet
a
medium
bodied
pilsner
darker
colored
and
very
malty
and
hoppy
for
a
pilsner
perhaps
it
supposed
to
be
a
cross
between
a
pilsner
and
an
amber
malts
are
nutty
and
slightly
sweet
hops
are
citrusy
touch
of
orangish
flavor
in
the
taste
im
not
sure
what
this
beer
is
supposed
to
be
it
not
a
pilsner
and
not
an
amber
or
vienna
its
somewhere
between
the
two
and
gets
sort
of
lost
somewhere
along
the
way
its
drinkable
but
lacks
any
sort
of
identity

overall
a
pretty
nice
beer
had
this
on
draft
in
pittsburgh
nice
golden
copper
color
very
lively
in
the
glass
with
tingly
carbonation
on
the
tongue
solid
body
for
the
style
with
some
big
malt
at
the
front
that
finished
up
a
bit
dry
something
about
the
beer
suggested
a
touch
of
mineral
like
a
hoppedup
bass
very
drinkable
and
pleasant
the
head
comes
on
big
and
dies
in
a
half
a
minute
to
a
lacy
blanket
and
left
next
to
no
trace
on
the
glass
clear
orange
with
yellow
tinture
and
a
bubbling
body
what
a
great
malt
this
beer
has
a
wonderful
bitter
pinch
of
hops
on
the
mid
palate
and
a
floral
scent
lingering
on
in
the
mouth
and
nose
outstanding
scent
for
a
pilsner
not
a
bit
skunky
or
bland
an
earthy
quality
also
is
notable
with
a
flavor
evoking
the
early
fall
by
the
three
rivers
you
dont
have
to
drink
iron
city
to
enjoy
the
steelers
without
getting
beat
up
this
is
very
drinkable
if
a
bit
watery
beautiful
light
beer
loaded
with
beer
thanks
for
reading
my
review
this
was
probably
the
first
micro
i
ever
had
in
my
life
and
err
some
years
later
its
still
one
that
i
enjoy
quite
a
bit
its
a
shame
this
isnt
a
nationally
distributed
beer
but
hey
more
for
us
in
the
burgh
f
an
easy
drinking
relatively
malty
pilsner
that
lacks
some
of
the
qualities
i
expect
in
a
pilsner
i
want
a
pilsner
to
look
clean
and
clear
and
special
this
is
a
dark
gold
hazy
color
the
haziness
is
a
turnoff
right
away
on
the
nose
i
want
some
spiciness
with
this
i
get
fruitiness
like
apples
on
the
finsih
i
want
a
crisp
spicy
hop
bite
on
this
i
get
pretty
much
nothing
except
lingering
sweetness
on
the
plus
side
this
isnt
a
bad
tasting
beer
its
easy
drinking
with
some
good
maltiness
on
the
taste
but
overall
i
find
it
lacking
in
many
areas
i
suppose
i
could
have
a
bad
bottle
but
it
doesnt
taste
spoiled
or
old
nothing
special
here
in
my
opinion
appears
an
amber
gold
in
color
with
an
off
white
cram
colored
head
leaves
rings
of
lace
as
the
glass
empties
aroma
consists
of
caramel
like
malts
with
mild
floral
hallertau
hops
kicking
in
the
background
with
a
sweet
buttery
nose
very
sweet
taste
at
the
forefront
with
a
mildly
syrup
like
flavor
that
is
balanced
by
the
delicate
hop
bitterness
this
beer
will
live
on
as
a
true
classic
from
the
pittsburgh
area
mouthfeel
is
medium
to
light
in
body
but
the
sweet
malt
rolls
over
the
palate
sticking
to
the
tongue
as
each
sip
is
swallowed
down
as
for
drinkability
the
flagship
beer
of
the
penn
brewery
is
one
of
the
most
refreshingsatisfying
session
beers
around
overall
a
good
beer
one
pilsner
i
wouldnt
mind
drinking
a
few
of
drinkability
not
my
favorite
style
of
beer
but
this
does
a
good
job
of
keeping
my
interest
a
hot
and
humid
richmond
summer
day
with
a
nice
grasscutting
session
thrown
in
for
good
measure
would
make
this
beer
taste
even
better
a
good
candidate
for
a
transition
beer
for
the
macrominded
beerdrinker
pours
a
clear
amber
color
with
a
white
head
that
leaves
some
lace
medium
bodied
nose
is
a
slightly
sweet
and
malty
starts
sweet
but
finishes
with
a
some
hoppy
bitterness
actually
a
simple
pilsner
that
isnt
overloaded
with
hops

i
thought
this
was
a
very
unusual
pilsner
my
experience
with
pilsner
and
i
am
not
a
big
fan
of
the
style
is
they
are
usually
harder
crisper
lighter
and
hoppier
this
one
i
liked
a
ton
more
roundness
and
depth
of
flavor
then
what
i
am
accustomed
a
pils
to
be
great
job
here
this
could
become
a
staple
of
mine
i
am
not
usually
a
fan
of
pilsners
not
able
to
accept
that
pilsners
could
be
rescued
from
the
macroworld
i
suppose
but
this
brew
impressed
me
some
deep
amber
slightly
hazy
color
with
a
foamy
white
head
slightly
malty
aroma
with
hints
of
spicy
floral
hops
the
flavor
is
initially
malty
with
a
great
spicy
hop
presence
very
flavorful
and
smooth
lager
with
a
clean
sharp
bitterness
touching
the
finish
pours
a
dark
amber
with
a
bright
white
dense
head
the
head
slowly
fades
to
a
ring
of
foam
around
the
edge
of
the
glass
that
leaves
a
light
lace
as
you
drink
a
slight
chill
haze
is
evident
the
aroma
has
a
noticeable
malt
component
backed
by
the
crisp
yet
spicy
hallertau
hops
the
taste
shows
a
bit
of
malt
sweetness
up
front
with
excellent
hop
levels
in
the
mid
which
results
in
good
bitterness
on
the
finish
the
aftertaste
is
comprised
of
the
lingering
hops
but
a
bit
of
the
malt
sweetness
reappears
after
a
few
seconds
the
mouthfeel
is
solid
for
a
pilsner
with
just
enough
carbonation
to
lend
a
crispness
to
the
palate
the
drinkability
is
also
very
good
as
this
balanced
beer
is
very
enjoyable
and
goes
down
smooth
a
very
good
beer
that
is
the
penn
brewing
staple
and
one
of
the
first
true
local
beers
i
experienced
this
pilsner
poured
a
surprisingly
dark
bronze
color
much
darker
than
your
normal
pils
thin
head
but
good
retention
a
malt
sweetness
greets
the
nose
with
a
bit
of
spicy
hop
notes
the
taste
also
reflects
the
considerable
malt
presence
very
sweet
with
only
a
bit
of
hops
toward
the
end
i
was
again
surprised
by
this
beer
and
its
interpretation
of
a
pilsner
style
only
small
bitter
notes
and
not
too
much
sharpness
or
crispness
the
mouthfeel
was
good
lighter
body
with
good
prickliness
on
the
tongue
while
this
was
definitely
a
new
pilsner
experience
for
me
i
was
impressed
by
its
honest
easydrinking
and
quality
taste
like
most
penn
brewing
products
this
makes
for
a
great
beer
to
be
had
dayin
and
dayout
while
retaining
the
german
roots
of
the
recipes
great
job
from
the
folks
in
pittsburgh
worth
the
time
to
drink
a
few
with
friends
clear
copper
color
surprisingly
dark
for
a
pilsener
light
brown
bubbly
head
the
head
fell
nicely
down
the
glass
noticable
malty
sweetness
on
the
smell
taste
was
bubbly
and
much
sweeter
than
i
expected
as
well
in
fact
i
would
have
never
guessed
it
to
be
a
pils
at
all
subtle
hop
flavors
finally
show
up
toward
the
finish
lacks
the
sour
sharp
bitterness
of
other
pilseners
as
well
as
the
bubbly
back
of
the
tongue
finish
very
easy
to
drink
however
i
think
this
would
make
a
suitable
transition
beer
for
the
macro
drinkers
quite
dark
for
a
pils
maybe
they
should
have
kept
the
crystal
malt
out
for
the
sake
of
style
conformity
also
not
enough
hop
for
the
style
imho
tastes
great
though
i
could
quaff
ten
of
these
easy
and
still
enjoy
the
flavor
bears
a
striking
resemblance
to
their
marzen
clear
golden
in
color
fresh
smell
of
quality
ingredients
rather
boring
taste
not
enough
in
the
way
of
subletees
or
nuances
to
warrent
a
higher
praise
a
little
spritzy
a
pedrestian
brew
but
an
above
average
lawnmower
beer
i
am
sorry
this
beer
may
be
traditionally
decoction
brewed
with
all
barleymalt
but
it
does
not
have
any
real
malt
character
it
is
kind
of
a
boring
pilsner
there
is
nothing
in
the
way
of
hops
in
the
aroma
or
flavor
it
tastes
almost
anheuser
busch
clean
it
seems
like
a
transition
beer
made
for
the
bud
crowd
the
schnitzel
i
had
there
was
delicious
though
i
appreciate
their
efforts
to
help
people
along
with
development
of
their
beer
palates
notes
hmmm
tastes
like
it
was
freshly
shipped
over
from
germany
not
bad
at
all
a
good
find
for
any
pilsner
geek
or
even
a
macro
brewery
becks
or
similar
drinker
this
beer
tases
like
an
ale
maybe
the
slightly
darker
color
is
throwing
me
off
it
is
smooth
to
the
mouth
and
does
invite
you
to
try
more
overall
it
is
above
average
and
would
be
great
with
spicy
foods
back
in
my
pittsburgh
days
i
was
a
big
fan
of
the
brewery
as
it
was
one
of
the
first
to
open
a
public
beer
garden
on
site
penn
pilsner
is
my
favorite
of
their
bottled
products
but
not
as
hoppy
as
the
kaiser
pils
on
tap
at
the
pub
nice
color
bolder
than
a
pilsner
urquel
mouthfeel
is
good
and
a
nice
aftertaste
the
slightly
maltier
dark
has
all
the
charm
of
a
michelob
dark
but
now
im
an
avowed
ale
guy
and
rarely
stray
into
cold
fermenters
except
for
malty
oktoberfests
and
bocks
i
remember
this
as
a
standout
from
a
nearby
brewfest
a
couple
years
back
an
authentic
version
of
this
much
copied
style
a
nice
balance
between
the
grainy
malt
flavors
and
the
subtle
spicy
hops
give
a
smooth
satisfying
taste
though
not
my
favorite
style
this
is
a
wonderful
pilsner
crisp
and
refreshing
how
could
i
not
like
this
beer
in
the
heart
of
pittsburgh
with
a
great
view
of
the
heinz
plant
lets
gander
at
that
label
copy
this
amber
lager
is
one
of
the
worlds
most
balanced
beer
styles
nuanced
flavors
drift
from
semisweet
bready
malt
notes
to
a
floral
and
spicy
kick
from
whole
cone
european
hops
and
more
vienna
style
lairs
were
on
the
brink
of
extinction
until
american
craft
brewers
helped
revive
the
style
its
a
good
thing
they
did
these
delicate
beers
lean
on
light
and
bready
malt
flavors
but
walk
a
fine
balanced
line
with
wholecone
european
hops
contributing
a
dry
finish
overall
one
of
the
few
vienna
beers
that
i
have
had
the
sweet
bready
taste
is
nice
and
different
than
a
normal
beer
it
grows
on
you
as
you
drink
it
overy
delicious
beer
wish
i
had
tried
it
sooner
best
in
style
out
there
excellent
combo
of
hop
and
malt
with
nose
following
taste
make
it
year
round
sn
very
nice
lager
with
a
hoppy
finish
d
superb
drinkability
in
that
this
has
a
ton
of
malt
flavor
with
a
great
body
to
balance
seems
fairly
traditional
to
the
style
and
rather
well
done
to
me
not
sure
what
the
purists
think
but
i
enjoyed
this
quite
a
bit
and
would
take
it
over
a
sam
adams
any
day
of
the
week
pretty
good
but
its
no
boston
lager
nice
and
clear
orange
copper
in
color
with
a
bit
of
a
frothy
head
that
provides
a
bit
of
lace
the
aroma
is
a
bit
thin
but
does
seem
right
for
the
style
i
get
biscuity
grain
with
a
good
bit
of
sweet
caramel
there
is
also
a
dose
of
grassy
flowery
hops
as
well
the
caramel
and
malt
are
the
focus
in
the
taste
however
a
good
deal
of
bitterness
is
in
there
as
well
without
much
in
the
way
of
specific
hop
flavor
that
is
the
finish
is
pretty
neutral
as
the
sweet
character
of
the
beer
is
only
just
surpassed
by
the
bitterness
to
leave
just
a
slight
hop
tingle
on
the
tongue
overall
this
is
good
but
maybe
not
as
good
as
some
others
in
the
style
an
excellent
take
on
a
classic
style
overall
this
is
my
favorite
from
the
sn
fall
pack
im
not
a
huge
lager
guy
but
i
would
definitely
buy
this
again
sn
can
do
no
wrong
even
beer
styles
i
do
not
normally
like
are
good
when
they
make
it
see
black
ipa
sn
brew
masters
are
like
rock
stars
of
the
craft
beer
world
o
i
wanted
to
like
this
beer
i
really
did
i
love
vienna
lagers
to
the
point
that
the
glbc
eliot
ness
is
one
of
my
favorite
beers
of
all
time
but
when
you
take
a
vienna
lager
and
do
your
utmost
to
transform
it
into
an
americanized
hop
monster
version
you
lose
me
completely
overall
its
a
fine
beer
i
wouldnt
rush
to
the
store
to
buy
a
6
or
12
pack
if
that
was
available
for
this
beer
but
its
just
slightly
above
average
the
hop
profile
throws
me
off
a
little
in
something
this
malty
but
thats
just
me
id
say
get
the
fall
seasonal
pack
of
sierra
nevada
beers
if
you
still
see
it
in
your
area
and
give
it
a
try
for
yourself

this
vienna
is
a
pretty
decent
beer
im
not
gonna
say
its
the
best
beer
ive
ever
had
or
even
the
best
vienna
that
goes
to
sam
adams
boston
lager
but
it
is
a
good
beer
on
tap
im
sure
this
beer
would
kill
its
a
good
combination
of
malt
and
hop
and
though
i
wouldnt
go
out
of
my
way
to
buy
a
six
pack
i
would
have
it
again
in
a
single
o
this
is
one
of
the
best

not
a
bad
take
on
the
style
but
i
found
it
to
be
pretty
mediocre
sierra
nevada
did
a
good
job
hopping
up
this
brew
but
this
is
a
style
i
prefer
to
lean
towards
the
malts
rather
than
the
hops
definitely
not
a
waste
of
my
time
or
money
but
not
something
i
would
run
out
and
buy
again
oa
bland
an
boring
beer
not
much
in
the
way
of
flavor
but
there
is
nothing
bad
about
it
taste
is
toasty
and
malty
up

with
a
nice
citrus
hop
zing
at
the
finish
light
balanced
and
very
well
done
enjoyable
mouthfeel
is
probably
the
best
part
nice
medium
body
so
its
not
too
light
or
heavy
yet
it
possesses
a
nice
full
flavor
while
its
buttery
its
still
clean
and
pretty
smooth
carbonation
isnt
too
strong
but
i
wouldnt
describe
it
as
modest
either
its
perfect
for
the
style
hits
both
the
sweet
and
bitter
parts
of
your
tongue
in
a
big
way
and
balanced
perfectly
starts
sweet
yet
gets
a
nice
buttery
and
spicy
somewhat
dry

crazy
drinkable
could
be

anyone
who
likes

not

a

in

profile
at
all
this
beer
would
stand
up

still
be
a

cleanser
another
quality
product
from

o
flavorful
and
easy
to
drink
plus
it
fits
the
season
very
well
somewhat
comparable
to
sabl
but
different
enough
to
be
worth
a
purchase

the
whole

is
pretty

spoton

overall
a

one
i
would
hope
sierra
nevada
revisits
in
the
future
just
picked
up
the
fall
12
pack
and
i
was
a
little
leery
of
the
whole
october
fest
style
so
having
been
a
fan
of
the
pale
ale
already
i
decided
to
try
this
one
first
i
must
admit
its
better
than
i
anticipated
its
a
dry
lager
very
bready
and
not
as
malty
as
some
other
fall
beers
its
got
a
light
crisp
taste
and
a
good
amount
of
carbonation
the
hops
are
ever
present
as
with
most
sierra
nevada
brews
which
i
love
i
dont
know
if
i
would
pick
this
over
torpedo
but
i
definitely
would
revisit
it
o
a
well
done
lager
revisit
the
lager
every
now
and
again
o
superior
balance
makes
this
one
super
drinkable
and
a
welcomed
addition

the
fall

nice
scents
of

a
caramel
aroma
is
also
present
though
it

overall
impression

aroma
is
of
a
wonderfully
crisp
lager
that
is
quite
malt
forward
though
not
quite
so
much
as
an
oktoberfest
it
suffers
only
from
the
caramel
aroma
which
is
not
unpleasant

is
untraditional

nicely

impression

is
of
a
nice
vienna
lager
that
balances
malt
and
hops
quite
well
it
is
malty
upfront
but
gains
a
nice
noble

character
in
the
middle

finish
to
form
a

a
smooth

wonderfully
true

overall
this
is
a
very

it
has
an
excellent

the
xfactor
is
not
an

remarkably

highly
recommended
a

lager

brews

availability
after
the

12

go
away
overall
a
marvelous
lager
from
sierra
nevada
and
one
that
i
hope
they
move
into
seasonal
or
permanent
six
packs
this
beer
would
be
perfect
with
mexican
food
and
is
a
step
above
other
common
vienna
lagers
negra
modelo
as
it
is
considerably
smoother
and
less
earthy
than
the
mexican
examples
very
impressed
and
would
definitely
recommend
o
if
it
didnt
have
that
slight
rubbing
alcohol
medicinal
note
it
would
be
at

a
halfpoint
higher
as
it
is
its
still

to
come
across
as
above
average
for
a
style
that
is
typically
pretty
specific
in
its
range
of
characteristics
this
manages
to
represent
it
well
and
still
set
itself
apart
a
bit
it
isnt
superb
but
memorable
enough
that
it
could
draw
you
back
and
i
could
see
this
becoming
a
budget
favorite
of
mine
among
germaninfluenced
domestic
lagers
this
here
wedding
is
winding
down
and
theres
some
sierra
nevada
at
the
hotel
lets
get
some
eh
this
stuff
pours
a
clear
bronzecopper
topped
by
a
finger
of
offwhite
foam
the
nose
comprises
sweet
biscuit
malt
light
dried
honey
a
twang
of
mild
sweetgrass
and
sweet
flowers
the
taste
brings
in
more
of
the
same
the
relatively
mild
sweetness
of
the
malt
balancing
very
nicely
with
the
floral
lightlygrassy
hops
the
body
is
a
light
medium
with
a
light
moderate
carbonation
and
a
dryish
finish
overall
a
very
strong
vienna
lager
one
thats
far
too
easy
to
drink
for
its
own
good
or
rather
mine
quite
the
pleasant
cap
to
a
wonderful
day
very
good
beer
this
is
a
nice
example
of
the
style
by
sierra
nevada
they
stay
true
to
style
and
present
a
traditional
example
of
the
style
taste
is
bready
malt
and
nuts
with
a
slick
yet
dry
herbal
bitter
finish
this
is
a
solid
drinkable
beer
it
is
tasty
crisp
and
refreshing
yet
it
lacks
the
wow
factor
i
could
drink
lots
of
these
but
there
are
more
flavorful
alternatives
solid
attempt
at
this
classic
style
not
as
fulfilling
as
those
i
have
had
in
europe
but
still
quite
good
i
would
say
that
great
lakes
eliot
ness
is
still
the
standard
bearer
for
u
s
interpretations
of
this
style

the

very

ive
had
in
fact
great
balance
to
it
overall
a
nice
beer
plenty
of
flavor
smooth
and
easy
to
enjoy
pretty
straight
forward
style
yet
has
enough
flavor
to
enjoy
even
the
most
complex

palates
worth
making

fruity
salty
malty
taste
with
a
dry

light

medium

and
good

very
tasty
and
balanced
would
buy
again
the
fruity
notes
detract
somewhat
but
this
is
easy
enough
to
drink
purchased
as
part
of
the
fall
variety
12
pack
for
about
13
50
o
3
5
good
malty
flavor
profile
sessionable
but
im
not
sure
how
often
id
buy
this
even
if
it
was
available
in
6
packs
however
it
is
a
perfect
fit
for
the
mixed
fall
pack
that
i
may
buy
again
this
fallevery
fall
clear
copper
color
nice
malty
nose
and
good
malt
profile
the
body
is
a
thinner
than
a
exceptional
example
of
the
style
but
this
offering
would
make
for
a
darn
good
session
beer
overall
this
is
an
exceedingly
drinkable
vienna
lager
but
a
little
too
sweet
to
be
among
my
favorites
for
the
style
o
ok
nothing
special
imo
but
i
rated
it
a
3
5
as
i
think
it
fits
the
style
nicely
taste
palate
the
flavor
is
well
balanced
leaning
just
towards
the
malty
sweet
side
like
the
aroma
it
has
a
very
nice
malty
sweetness
with
light
toffee
and
nougat
like
sweetness
that
is
delicately
balanced
by
noble
hop
spice
it
has
a
medium
body
and
a
smooth
easy
drinking
feel
the
drinkability
of
this
beer
is
crazy
good
overall
i
wish
they
made
something
like
this
year
rounda
nice
complement
to
the
excellent
elliot
ness
vienna
style
lager
from
great
lakes
brewing
drinks
pretty
easy
needs
a

pretty

this
is

im
not
usually
to
much
of
a
fan
of
lagers
but
i
think
this
is
pretty
good
an
enjoyable
vienna
lager
not
overly
malty
or
hoppy
i
could
drink
a
few
of
these
3

overall
a
good
take
on
the
vienna
style
not
too
exciting
but
a
nice
light
fall
offering
serving
type
bottle
o
the
great
combo
of
light
bready
malts
and
spicy
noble
hops
is
well
done
ive
had
mandarina
hops
in
other
beers
but
never
used
quite
as
well
imo
i
may
have
been
hoping
for
a
less
bitter
more
rounded
malt
character
in
this
beer
but
the
balance
sn
has
achieved
is
very
nice
o
nicely
crafted
in
almost
every
facet
and
surprisingly
good
beats
sam
adams
flagship
brew
at
its
own
game
overall
i
thought
this
was
a
nice
beer
and
i
thought
it
was
a
good
example
of
a
vienna
lager
i
dont
drink
this
style
too
often
simply
because
there
isnt
a
lot
of
them
available
to
me
but
i
know
enough
about
this
style
to
be
able
to
pick
out
a
good
one
and
i
can
tell
that
this
is
what
a
vienna
lager
should
be
like
this
beer
had
good
drinkability
it
was
smooth
clean
crisp
not
filling
and
the
taste
did
a
nice
job
at
holding
my
attention
i
could
see
myself
drinking
a
few
of
these
without
getting
bored
with
it
and
i
think
it
would
make
for
a
nice
lager
to
enjoy
during
the
fall
what
i
liked
the
most
about
this
beer
was
how
true
to
style
it
was
it
had
everything
that
ive
come
to
expect
from
the
style
and
nothing
seemed
out
of
place
or
unnecessary
what
i
liked
the
least
about
this
beer
was
nothing
there
isnt
anything
that
i
disliked
or
would
change
about
it
i
would
buy
this
beer
again
and
on
its
own
i
think
a
six
pack
for
the
fall
would
be
pretty
nice
i
would
recommend
this
to
people
who
like
the
style
or
anybody
whos
looking
for
a
nice
easy
drinking
beer
with
a
little
bit
of
flavor
to
it
all
in
all
i
was
happy
with
this
beer
and
its
just
what
i
want
from
the
style
sierra
nevada
did
this
style
justice
this
isnt
my
favorite
beer
from
sierra
nevada
but
its
got
to
be
one
of
the
best
vienna
lagers
ive
had
nice
job
guys
keep
up
the
good
work
this
is
a
pretty
solid
tasty
brew
very
drinkable
not
my
favorite
style
but
it
would
be
an
enjoyable
accompaniment
on
tap
with
a
meal
overall
score
4
104
15
overall
really
a
great
beer
that
succeeds
in
balancing
sweet
nutty
malts
with
subtle
herbal
hops
if
this
were
made
into
a
612
pack
format
i
would
gladly
buy
this
but
for
now
ill
just
have
to
buy
the
fall
pack
again
hope
this
shows
up
again
next
year
90100
overall
this
is
a
nice
vienna
lager
but
it
doesnt
really
stand
out
o
super
drinkable
lager
and
with
the
extra
body
in
it
this
is
definitely
a
nicer
light
drinking
beer
for
crisp
autumn
days
a
bit
less
malty
than
your
average
oktoberfest
but
still
hearty
nonetheless
awesome
to
see
a
new
autumn
seasonal
from
sierra
nevada
this
is
the
first
of
the
fall
variety
pack
ive
had
but
so
far
its
11
id
say
this
beers
best
quality
is
that
its
very
easydrinking
and
lends
it
self
to
drinking
many
at
a
time
theres
nothing
that
really
shines
in
this
beer
its
more
of
a
lowkey
subtle
offering
in
terms
of
the
malt
forward
octoberfest
styles
this
one
is
better
than
average
right
amount
of
sweetness
and
smoothness
but
far
from
being
insubstantial
in
any
regard
i
would
pass
by
a
sam
adams
boston
lager
to
drink
this
example
of
a
vienna
lager
in
a
heartbeat
not
bad
poured
a
clear
golden
yellow
with
a
finger
of
foamy
white
head
that
receded
to
a
thin
layer
of
bubbles
grainy
aroma
with
notes
of
caramel
malts
same
with
the
taste
grainy
lightly
toasted
caramel
malts
grassy
but
a
little
bit
of
a
stale
aftertaste
lightmedium
body
and
pretty
nonthreatening
and
drinkable
overall
a
tasty
lager
clean
and
nicely
hopped
its
a
light
spicy
taste
with
a
some
grainy
barley
and
wheat
hops
are
slightly
metallic
but
otherwise
add
a
nice
crispness
sweet
and
grassy
this
brew
was
true
to
style
and
on
the
scorchingly
hot
day
when
there
was
a
wait
for
table
yet
the
entire
patio
was
empty
this
brew
really
hit
the
spot
as
my
favorite
of
the
sampler
and
i
ended
up
with
a
half
pint
of
it
very
good
lager
drinkability
im
not
a
big
fan
of
this
style
and
this
one
wasnt
anything
special
for
me
the
high
carbonation
causes
to
much
mouthnumbing
and
bloating
is
that
a
word
on
top
of
that
the
flavor
is
light
and
kinda
boring
a
decent
beer
for
the
style
but
id
rather
go
for
something
else
especially
at
the

a
darker
golden
color
with
a
small
head
there
is
a
slightly
hoppy
aroma
the
taste
has
a
noticeable
hop
flavor
but
mostly
on
a
flat
malty
backbone
good
flavors
and
good
body
but
a
bit
harsh
on
the
tongue
overall
its
a
not
bad
vienna
lager
good
full
flavors
but
a
bit
boring
and
harsh
by
the
way
this
brewery
makes
an
outstanding
root
beer
overall
really
nice
lager
great
balance
and
very
drinkable
rjt
sprecher
is
only
now
distributing
frequently
to
our
area
and
i
have
had
this
one
on
my
want
list
for
some
time
and
now
its
in
cans
so
it
tastes
like
it
was
just
made
pickedit
up
last
night
cold
and
took
it
home
poured
deep
goldenamber
with
nice
12
inch
creamcolor
foam
on
top
ample
carbonation
brought
out
a
subtle
malt
smell
and
hint
of
bitterness
in
the
nose
initial
taste
was
biscuity
malt
with
a
hint
just
enough
of
sweetness
followed
by
a
refreshing
hops
bitterness
that
immediately
tickles
the
taste
buds
and
makes
your
mouth
water
as
it
warmed
it
just
got
better
lacing
the
glass
all
the
way
down
very
well
balanced
very
drinkable
maybe
too
drinkable
and
yet
with
a
craftbrew
mouthfeel
and
only
5
abv
it
was
hard
to
put
down
excellent
ive
been
drinking
this
beer
for
25
years
its
one
of
my
two
or
three
standbys
offering
smoothness
in
a
sessionable
brew
o
pretty
good
session
lager
id
drink
this
again
especially
if
it
was
fresher
o
maybe
having
eliot
ness
earlier
on
this
trip
set
the
bar
high
for
a
vienna
lager
but
this
was
essentially
a
drainpour
ill
pass
wisonsin
has
many
other
good
choices
oa
very
nice
beer
more
like
a
lighter
amber
not
quite
as
robust
as
sam
adams
boston
lager
but
a
more
drinkable
version
if
you
like
boston
lager
but
are
looking
for
something
that
is
a
bit
more
drinkable
in
larger
quantities
e
g
more
of
a
session
beer
and
want
to
save
a
few
pennies
this
is
a
worthy
choice
perhaps
i
got
a
bad
batch
the
beer
was
desent
at
best
overall
its
been
hit
or
miss
with
this
brewery
but
i
just
dont
see
any
reason
to
revisit
this
one
i
had
been
impressed
by
several
sprechers
beers
a
few
years
ago
on
trips
to
the
midwest
but
i
have
not
had
any
good
ones
recently
maybe
the
distributor
strew
some
of
their
beers
around
the
country
a
couple
years
ago
and
left
them
for
the
unwary
beer
adventurer
not
as
refined
as
i
anticipated
but
that
did
not
throw
me
back
at
all
fresh
flavors
and
a
bit
of
rawness
really
worked
here
for
me
o
very
solid
lager
here
and
definitely
one
of
my
favorites
from
sprecher
takes
me
back
to
the
first
brewer
game
played
at
miller
park
i
was
guzzling
these
in
the
sprecher
tent
while
tailgating
the
next
morning
my
dad
asked
me
about
when
they
opened
up
the
retractable
roof
i
was
like
the
what
now
who
won
thanks
sprecher
o
as
i
grow
older
i
find
the
good
experiences
in
my
life
are
growing
in
number
enough
that
i
will
only
remember
the
extraordinary
experiences
a
nice
beer
i
will
not
remember
or
visit
again

o
drinkable
but
i
wouldnt
buy
this
beer
if
i
had
anymore
i
would
probably
give
them
away
to
make
room
for
some
other
stuff
fresh
bottle
from
the
brewery
a
little
cheesy
aroma
much
head
that
resulted
in
a
small
retained
head

light
yellow

not
very
drinkablegrassy
herbal
light

medium

a

just
not
so
tasty
a
little

no
significant

this
beer
is
very
easy
to
drink
and
is
how
a
lager
should
be
good
carbonation
provides
a
rich
mouthfeel
ogood
easy
drinking
not
to
complex
pours
out
translucent
golden
brown
with
a
short
lived
two
finger
fluffy
head
mild
lacing
smells
mostly
of
heavy
caramel
malt
bready
yeasty
notes
and
some
very
mild
earthy
and
spice
hop
aspects
taste
is
like
graham
crackers
and
nuttinged
malts
stampeding
all
over
your
tongue
the
mild
hop
presence
doesnt
even
appear
until
the
finish
and
even
than
it
is
an
understated
kiss
goodnight
of
noble
hops
on
your
lips
it
could
use
a
small
boost
to
those
noble
hops
however
the
body
is
the
main
issue
with
this
brew
to
my
mouth
this
beer
comes
across
as
thin
and
watery
if
only
it
had
a
slightly
chewier
texture
or
just
a
bit
heavier
body
than
i
would
have
to
search
really
damn
hard
to
find
something
else
to
nitpick
pours
a
golden
amber
color
with
a
very
bubbly
head
of
foam
scent
is
strong
with
grassy
wheats
malts
and
a
slight
touch
of
citrus
taste
is
bold
and
refined
it
is
a
smooth
well
blended
mixture
of
wheats
hops
and
malts
is
rather
refreshing
with
a
not
too
lightnot
to
strong
taste
that
drinks
perfectly
probably
one
of
the
best
vienna
lagers
ive
had
to
date
a
good
german
lager
at
a
really
affordable
price
the
crack
introduced
me
to
a
very
active
beer
that
jumped
right
out
at
me
like
a
little
kid
on
the
arrival
of
a
favorite
relative
i
let
it
settle
down
as
i
always
do
with
little
kids
taking
a
w
c
fields
stance
towards
them
the
glug
resulted
in
a
dense
rocky
finger
of
tawny
head
with
modest
retention
as
to
color
this
was
truth
in
advertising
at
its
finest
a
beautiful
deep
amber
bordering
on
copper
with
nequality
clarity
when
i
see
women
with
a
natural
head
of
hair
this
color
i
fall
instantly
in
lust
i
turn
into
lennie
from
of
mice
and
men
so
to
speak
lets
see
where
this
beer
lands
within
that
spectrum
it
pours
a
clear
amber
how
thoroughly
apropos
topped
by
a
halffinger
of
slightly
offwhite
foam
the
nose
comprises
biscuits
with
a
light
moderate
carbonation
and
a
feel
that
leans
toward
watery
without
ever
actually
making
it
all
the
way
there
overall
drinkable
with
meals
or
at
social
occasions
where
the
beer
isnt
the
feature
ie
decent
tablebeer
should
go
well
with

session
beer
if

are
looking

this

throws
out

if
you
are
ever
in
wisconsin
pick
us
up
a
half
barrel
this
is
a
beer
not
to
be
missed
this
beer
is
a
fake
microbrew
made
by
budweiser
it
is
a
cheap
attempt
to
push
actual
craft
brewers
off
the
shelves
of
your
local
liquor
of
grocery
store
watch
the
documentary
called
beer
wars
i
flat
out
refuse
to
purchase
any
budweiser
products
after
seeing
it
about
average
nothing
really
speical
d
a
little
tasty
goes
down
ok
not
too
filling
mild
kick
decent
representation
of
style
it
might
not
be
the
best
organic
beer
out
there
but
its
worth
drinking
for
a
little
while
amber
in
color
with
loads
of
prickle
and
no
discernible
head
classic
beer
nose
nothing
out
of
the
ordinary
or
noteworthy
the
mouthfeel
is
nice
and
crisp
and
i
would
say
refreshing
as
a
matter
of
fact
i
found
the
mouthfeel
to
be
the
highlight
of
this
beer
other
than
the
organic
labeling
the
flavor
shifts
to
a
flat
and
earthy
flavor
unfortunately
the
best
comparison
i
can
make
for
the
flavor
is
day
old
keg
beer
like
the
stuff
you
try
to
drink
the
day
after
the
keg
party
but
didnt
quite
keep
warm
enough
drinkable
but
not
really
that
good
d
mediocre
drinkability
and
overall
enjoyment
worth
a
curious
try
but
not
at
the
expense
of
a
six
pack
a
little
too
watery
overall
not
that
great
an
ok
beer
but
nothing
to
remember
drinkability
was
good
and
if
i
find
a
sixer
on
sale
some
time
i
will
buy
it
good
sessionable
brew
well
i
wasnt
expecting
much
and
i
certainly
didnt
get
much
i
couldnt
call
this
a
vienna
lager
more
of
a
domestic
macro
amber
lager
kinda
reminds
me
of
a
ab
stab
at
sam
adams
light
d
if
it
wasnt
so
bitter
it
may
be
more
drinkable
but
alas
not
only
that
at
89
a
6pack
the
price
is
insanely
high
for
what
it
is
probably
because
its
organic
d
this
is
a
fairly
average
beer
nothing
to
say
wow
about
its
decent
and
coming
form
ab
im
surprised
they
put
out
an
organic
brew
drinkability
this
is
an
okay
vienna
lager
not
great
not
horrible
body
and
drinkabilkity
are
very
average
as
is
this
beer
from
a
12
oz
bottle
that
i
copped
for
about
1
50
from
wine
and
more
in
west
orange
scored
this
organic
lager
which
admittedly
caught
my
eye
because
of
the
organic
advertisement
on
the
bottle
from
the
website
learned
that
this
5
0
vienna
lager
is
organically
brewed
with
the
finest
malts
and
barley
i
really
liked
the
taste
from
this
brewery
in
california
that
ive
never
heard
of
appearance
was
nice
bronze
and
copper
with
a
nice
head
smell
was
robust
very
clear
and
slightly
hoppy
taste
was
very
crisp
clear
clean
and
smooth
nice
slight
caramel
and
vanilla
color
that
went
down
like
water
really
easily
this
brew
is
really
great
easily
drinkable
with
a
good
mouthfeel
slight
bread
and
butter
flavor
with
an
unrivalled
smoothness
definitely
recommended
poured
a
light
copper
gold
clear
wtih
a
sturdy
offwhite
head
aroma
is
very
subtle
just
a
hint
of
sweet
malt
taste
is
a
bit
thin
sweet
then
bitter
nothing
really
wrong
with
this
but
nothing
really
special
either
good
alternative
to
macro
i
guess
appearance
and
smell
was
of
a
standard
lager
a
little
behind
a
sam
adams
which
seems
to
be
the
most
obvious
comparison
had
a
very
strong
metallic
taste
to
me
that
didnt
seem
to
belong
interesting
but
not
something
i
would
really
try
again
its
clear
copper
in
appearance
with
a
twofinger
head
on
top
metallic
hop
twag
and
sweetish
malts
make
up
the
aroma
in
the
beer
sweet
and
doughy
flavors
from
the
malt
in
the
taste
with
a
mild
bitterness
for
balance
it
has
a
thinner
feel
with
mild
carbonation
the
aftertaste
has
a
mild
biscuity
note
overall
a
middle
of
the
pack
brew
this
beer
is
a
clear
straw
color
with
a
thin
white
head
and
minimal
lacing
mild
not
wild
hops
aroma
with
a
touch
of
grain
lightbodied
and
crisp
with
subtle
hops
and
musty
malt
flavoring
i
dont
know
if
pesticides
would
help
the
flavor
but
i
doubt
they
would
hurt
much
the
finish
is
mildly
bitter
and
short
and
there
is
a
lingering
sweetness
afterward
below
average
all
around
which
unfortunately
seems
to
be
the
case
with
most
organic
beers
looks
good
nice
amber
with
healthy
head
and
good
lacing
smell
is
somewhat
harsh
raw
grain
and
alcohol
none
of
that
lager
yeast
tang
and
no
crispness
taste
is
no
great
shakes
either
also
harsh
with
more
grainy
notes
a
touch
of
metal
and
sweet
fruitiness
on
the
end
mouthfeel
is
slightly
prickly
but
not
especially
crisp
eh
willing
to
give
it
a
chance
despite
the
ploy
but
not
much
here
for
me
trying
to
figure
out
the
purpose
of
this
beer
and
i
cant
do
it
considering
the
resources
behind
the
brewery
they
could
do
anything
and
instead
you
get
this
a
lightly
hoppy
light
bodied
lager
with
light
body
very
little
character
almost
no
head
and
no
lace
fruity
nice
clear
amber
color
tho
for
what
thats
worth
overall
as
far
as
vienna
lagers
go
i
guess
this
ones
fair
to
middlin
not
something
id
rush
out
to
buy
more
of
d
this
is
an
okay
vienna
lager
the
odd
bitter
taste
wasnt
good
but
it
still
tasted
descent

and
13
head
as
poured
into
a
pint
glass
light
tan
head
disolves
into
a
considerable
amount
of

left
on
the
glass
body
is
a
honey
gold
in
color
nose
hits
first
with
slight
tangy
hops
than
quickly
yields
to
raw
wheat
and
mineral
feel
but
very
light
after
first
sip
i
must
say
i
had
to
scan
the
label
to
make
sure
this
one
wasnt
secretly
produced
by
one
of
the
big
threecome
to
find
out
it
is
affiliated
overall
bland
with
just
a
tease
of
what
would
be
considered
wild
hops
slightly
bitter
earthy
feel
is
very
soft
on
the
mouthfeel
drinkable
as
you
would
expect
from
a
bland
lager
12oz

bottle
this
one
pours
a
nice
translucent
amber
with
a
thin
film
of
offwhite
head
smells
slightly
like
caramel
malt
tastes
sweet
like
caramel
chocolate
and
coffee
malt
with
a
hint
of
hop
bitterness
toward
the
finish
not
overpowering
certainly
but
a
nice
balance
of
subtle
flavors
lighter
in
body
with
a
generous
bit
of
carbonation
though
its
just
slightly
sticky
or
lingering
overall
a
decent
beer
though
not
the
best
example
of
the
style
not
bad
small
white
head
that
didnt
last
a
bit
of
a
hoppy
aroma
much
more
of
a
hoppy
flavor
than
the
usual
standard
ab
fare
but
nothing
special
drinkable
i
dont
get
the
incognito
idea
with
the
green
valley
brewing
did
they
think
we
wouldnt
find
out
this
is
an
anheuserbusch
product
overall
meh
not
wild
not
hoppy
not
worth
the
8
bucks
dont
get
me
wrong
its
not
bad
its
just
not
good
many
better
choices
out
there
in
the
category
for
the
price
the
mouthfeel
is
light
and
tangy
this
one
is
not
very
hoppy
nor
wild
as
the
name
indicates
but
it
goes
down
pretty
easily
appears
a
light
copper
amber
hue
with
an
off
white
decen
sized
head
dwindles
pretty
quickly
carbonation
is
large
bubbled
and
lacing
is
sporadic
and
sparse
on
my
glass
aroma
has
soft
bready
sweetness
touch
of
caramel
malt
with
a
light
hop
profile
definitely
shouldnt
be
called
wild
hop
maybe
tame
hop
would
be
more
appropriate
pretty
boring
flavor
is
really
mild
grainy
sweetness
no
real
hop
profile
here
touch
of
herbal
mix
of
grassiness
with
a
light
toasted
caramel
malt
flavor
very
boring
and
tame
at
eight
bucks
a
sixer
ill
pass
mouthfeel
is
light
bodied
carbonation
is
a
bit
too
high
and
somewhat
sharp
on
the
palate
drinkabiltiy
is
low
my
crave
factor
to
have
or
want
another
is
nonexistent
ill
pass
on
this
one
in
the
future
this
beer
poured
crystal
clear
and
amber
brown
with
a
descent
level
of
carbonation
the
head
that
was
produced
was
an
off
white
pillowy
foam
thick
and
sticky
and
good
density
of
bubbles
the
head
lasted
a
good
way
down
the
glass
until
it
fell
to
virtually
nothing
with
nothing
left
even
clinging
to
the
sides
this
was
pretty
much
the
highlight
of
the
beer
the
aroma
was
almost
non
existent
some
light
malt
and
a
hint
of
hops
but
that
was
it
on
the
nose
the
taste
was
pretty
much
like
the
nose
some
malt
hops
and
finished
light
with
fading
taste
that
left
you
pallet
very
fast
the
body
was
light
on
the
tongue
and
in
the
mouth
drinkability
maybe
again
depending
on
the
menu
and
i
might
give
it
a
chance
since
this
could
have
been
a
bad
batch
but
i
will
wait
and
see
drinkability
overall
i
found
this
a
boring
beer
that
i
had
a
hard
time
finishing
the
pint
not
worth
trying
d
its
decent
offering
from
a
macro
brewery
if
they
want
to
keep
this
sort
of
thing
up
i
wont
complain
its
better
than
busch
or
bud
and
any
presence
other
than
that
in
the
chain
grocery
aisles
is
a
plus
in
my
mind
not
a
bad
beer
but
not
much
else
to
reccomend
it
blandly
satisfying
would
be
a
good
phrase
to
use
for
it
i
did
note
that
the
fine
print
states
only
the
malts
are
organic
which
seems
a
bit
underwhelming
when
the
label
refers
to
the
beer
as
organic
wild
hop
lager
with
a
picture
of
hops
oh
well
still
this
is
probably
the
most
palateable
ab
product
ive
ever
had
i
probably
wont
buy
this
again
unless
i
have
to
as
there
are
so
many
other
more
interesting
beers
around
but
if
it
happened
to
be
around
it
would
work
for
something
to
drink
from
the
bottle
while
watching
a
baseball
game
nice
medium
hoppiness
definitely
there
but
not
too
strong
with
a
clean
finish
reminiscent
of
berries
maybe
a
little
too
fizzy
with
a
slightly
sticky
finish
overall
it
was
delightful
it
doesnt
taste
that
good
definitely
not
something
id
want
to
session
overall

nicely
hoppedup
for
a
lager
but
somehow
the
balance
seemed
a
bit
off
the
hopping
had
a
touch
of
harshness
or
rawedge
that
needed
some
ale
malt
to
smooth
out
and
it
was
a
bit
much
for
the
lager
to
carry
it
is
nice
however
to
see
this
ab
affiliated
enterprise
taking
on
the
task
of
making
a
hoppy
beer
and
actually
using
hops
pours
a
clear
golden
color
with
a
huge
head
of
large
off

relatively
neutralnot
something
i

as
the

warms

hints
of

mild
with
almost
a

no

hardly
i
guess
this
beer
is
just
trying
to
sell
on
the
fact
it
is
organic
they
may
get
many
to
try
it
based
on
the
organic
status
but
i
doubt
they
will
have
many
repeat
customers
boring
beer
for

and
too
much
grassy

dont
see
how
this

will
last
unless
my
taste

are
completely
off
if
you

i
suggest
you
let
it
warm

a

beer
i
have
to
say
i
had
never
seen
or
heard
of
until
todaypoured
a
lear
bronze
with
almost
no
head
to
speak
of
and
what
was
there
really
left
quickly
leaving
a
flat
looking
beer
afterwards
decent
aromas
some
toasty
and
lighlty
sweet
caramelly
malt
with
a
decent
dose
of
grass
and
sharp
herbbasic
not
much
frill
on
the
palate
outside
of
a
pretty
good
sharpness
imparted
by
a
healthy
dose
of
hop
otherwise
somewhat
sweet
and
caramelly
upfront
somewhat
flat
mouthfeel
kinda
wentdown
like
water
in
a
bad
way
its
decent
close
to
being
very
good
but
misses
on
a
few
key
points
highly
drinkable
subtle
but
well
done
i
saw
this
in
total
wine
in
landmark
va
and
wanted
to
give
it
a
try
having
read
the
recent
asn
and
mabn
articles
on
the
ab
hop
farm
in
idaho
that
mentioned
it
when
poured
in
the
glass
its
a
nice
amber
color
and
very
clear
the
head
starts
ok
but
thins
out
but
there
are
lots
of
bubbles
that
keep
bubbling
right
on
until
the
end
this
beer
has
a
clean
malty
aroma
that
smells
pretty
good
theres
a
decent
flavor
a
little
thin
but
a
lingering
finish
and
good
balance
all
the
way
through
i
think
theres
probably
too
much
carbonation
for
the
body
of
the
beer
all
in
all
theres
not
enough
going
on
to
really
want
any
more
ok
beer
but
nothing
really
special
i
appreciate
the
ecofriendly
and
allnatural
approach
but
i
wont
go
out
of
my
way
way
for
it
again
a
light
caramel
malt
body
and
flavor
with
an
assertive
addition
of
grassy
earthy
hops
lightly
pecanlike
and
mildly
peach
and
appricot
tasting
all
characters
blend
well
in
the
nose
but
the
flavor
is
dominated
by
the
hops
leaving
the
beer
seemingly
thin
and
out
of
balance
i
think
that
the
malts
are
properly
scaled
but
the
hops
are
very
heavy
in
comparison
good
session
brew
this
also
a
great
crossover
beer
but
certainly
not
something
for
hop
heads
light
bodied
and
surprisingly
flavorful
im
beginning
to
think
that
the
marketing
strategy
here
is
less
fool
the
beer
geeks
and
more
hide
the
true
brand
so
bud
drinkers
dont
think
weve
gone
all
fruity
a
surprisingly
nice
offering
from
ab
nonetheless
not
that
bad
an
effort
for
an
ab
beer
it
sure
beats
millers
explorations
into
craft
brewing
too
bad
they
were
20
years
late
in
getting
it
to
market
overall
impressions
not
a
bad
beer
but
im
not
sure
about
the
name
hop
flavors
are
definitely
not
a
dominate
feature
of
this
beer
so
why
name
the
beer
after
hops
body
is
a
bit
thin
but
it
is
drinkable
and
pleasant
a
little
sweet
nice
attempt
at
a
big
hopped
lager
thought
not
sure
of
the
ibus
here
and
victory
prima
pils
is
much
better
example
of
big
hopped
lager
but
good
balance
even
though
i
wanted
a
little
more
malt
cereal
to
come
through
but
thats
my
personal
preference
overall
a
very
drinkable
lager
i
was
pleasantly
suprised
with
this
beer
pours
a
light
orangish
amber
color
that
produces
a
small
fizzy
head
that
quickly
dissapears
into
nothing
very
faint
and
mild
aroma
that
features
some
mild
toasted
malt
and
a
faint
whiff
of
hops
taste
is
faint
toasted
malt
that
finishes
with
a
faint
hop
presence
overall
i
find
this
to
be
a
pretty
bland
and
extremely
watered
down
brew
i
can
almost
compare
it
to
a
watered
down
sam
adams
boston
lager
i
like
that
ab
is
trying
to
make
better
beer
but
this
one
needs
a
little
more
work
wild
hop
lager
starts
with
a
light
white
head
that
falls
quickly
into
just
a
ring
around
the
edge
and
a
few
islands
of
foam
no
lace
on
the
way
down
bright
golden
color
very
clear
and
sparkling
not
dark
enough
for
the
vienna
lager
listed
as
the
style
on
ba
but
more
macro
lager
which
makes
sense
since
the
website
says
green
valley
brewing
is
owned
by
ab
clean
aroma
with
the
fruityness
of
the
cascade
hops
coming
through
the
nose
actually
fairly
assertive
for
a
lager
appleish
smell
like
budcant
remember
what
causes
it
yeast
but
not
suprising
after
looking
at
the
website
the
nose
has
a
bit
of
complexity
at
least
more
than
a
normal
macro
enjoyable
if
youre
expectations
arent
too
high
wild
hop
organic
lager
was
amber
in
color
and
very
clear
with
an
offwhite
head
the
head
was
medium
in
size
with
decent
retention
the
aroma
was
citrus
hops
and
light
malt
the
taste
was
light
hops
with
some
sweet
malt
the
finsh
was
dry
with
light
hop
flavor
and
a
touch
of
bitterness
the
mouthfeel
was
thin
with
good
carbonation
drinkabilty
was
above
average
its
not
nearly
as
hoppy
the
name
wild
hop
would
suggest
but
a
decent
beer
overall
to
me
the
beer
was
way
too
thin
in
flavor
and
smell
i
was
hoping
that
when
ab
jumped
into
this
end
of
the
market
they
would
bring
better
than
this
it
was
quite
drinkable
and
refreshing
but
more
like
a
lawn
mower
domestic
macro
than
a
flavorful
micro
at
7
99
a
six
pack
i
could
have
gotten
more
for
less
overall
its
new
so
i
had
to
try
it
its
not
bad
but
for
the
price
7
50
i
can
get
a
better
beer
being
affiliated
with
ab
its
one
of
their
finer
beers
on
a
side
note
is
this
really
a
vienna
lager
cheers
clear
tangerine
with
some
off
white
head
and
minimal
lacing
smell
is
a
bit
weak
some
maltyness
but
not
much
there
taste
is
a
bit
richer
more
malty
and
some
crisp
hoppyness
in
the
background
mouthfeel
has
some
body
to
it
some
suds
but
finishes
on
the
thin
soapy
side
overall
fairly
drinkable
light
and
refreshing
but
the
soapyness
would
really
start
bothering
me
after
a
few
dont
really
care
for
the
taste
much
it
has
some
toasted
maltiness
but
along
with
a
bit
of
the
perfume
like
hoppiness
leaves
a
bland
aftertaste
relatively
watery
body
not
a
whole
lot
of
flavor
personally
i
think
id
take
a
bud
over
this
not
impressed
with
abs
latest
foray
into
microstyle
beer
and
i
wanted
to
like
this
one
poured
from
the
bottle
to
a
bright
copper
color
with
some
carbonation
a
thin
offwhite
head
that
lingered
and
little
lacing
i
was
able
to
detect
some
hoppy
fruit
although
aroma
was
faint
flavor
was
hard
to
pick
out
anything
dominant
but
it
did
taste
finish
was
some
bitter
dryness
though
not
as
much
as
i
expected
when
you
have
hop
in
the
name
but
this
was
still
a
big
step
up
for
ab
off
to
a
good
start
if
ab
is
taking
craft
beer
seriously
good
things
could
happen
for
those
of
us
who
love
the
stuff
i
was
skeptical
but
this
was
a
positive
first
encounter
6

6pack
this
is
a
curious
move
by
anheuserbusch
its
a
move
toward
craft
beer
without
giving
any
hint
of
being
from
ab
on
the
packaging
it
seems
theyre
trying
to
lure
back
some
craft
beer
drinkers
without
scaring
them
away
with
the
ab
name
the
problem
is
this
one
wont
lure
back
the
craft
beer
crowd
its
just
nothing
special
and
is
essentially
the
first
baby
step
in
crossover
beers
my
only
hope
for
this
series
of
brews
from
ab
is
that
one
or
two
actually
stick
around
and
infiltrate
the
bud
miller
coors
bars
to
at
least
give
a
passable
option
for
craft
beer
drinkers
when
at
one
of
said
locations
other
than
that
this
one
is
an
average
if
not
solidly
made
brew
this
beer
poured
a
clear
golden
color
with
a
quickly
dissipating
head
the
smell
was
surprisingly
sweet
for
a
beer
called
wild
hop
the
taste
of
this
beer
was
smooth
and
balanced
between
malt
and
hops
the
mouthfeel
was
full
with
a
carbonation
bite
i
wasnt
really
expecting
much
with
the
organic
hops
being
advertised
but
was
pleasantly
surprised
i
think
this
is
a
delightfully
drinkable
beer
drinks
okay
but
not
enough
here
to
get
excited
about
having
said
that
this
is
a
step
in
the
right
direction
for
ab
id
buy
it
again
at
many
locales
where
there
arent
many
micros
to
choose
from
an
ab
product
i
have
to
plead
ignorance
when
i
picked
this
up
as
there
is
no
mention
of
this
being
made
by
the
world
macro
superpower
needless
to
say
it
took
only
a
few
sips
to
uncover
the
busch
similarity
and
for
me
to
make
pennance
to
the
gods
of
good
beer
but
that
maltiness
isnt
overwhelming
in
the
taste
nice
balance
with
that
and
noble
hops
grassiness
easy
drinking
nice
light
weight
feel
and
good
carbonation
fizz
would
go
well
with
many
menu
items
or
as
a
beginner
in
a
flight
sure
but
when
am
i
gonna
finally
get
my
hands
on
an
innsbruckstyle
amber
lager
anyway
this
stuff
pours
a
clear
copperamber
topped
by
a
finger
of
offwhite
foam
the
nose
comprises
dried
maple
syrup
straight
barley
light
biscuit
and
a
hint
of
lemon
pepper
didnt
see
that
last
one
coming
the
taste
brings
in
more
of
the
same
along
with
some
very
light
sweetgrass
and
a
thick
veneer
of
some
strange
vague
fruitiness
one
with
a
bit
of
vinosity
buoying
about
every
now
and
again
its
a
kinda
odd
combination
really
and
it
has
me
vacillating
between
bemusement
and
very
minor
disgust
its
hard
to
explain
the
body
is
a
light
medium
with
a
light
moderate
carbonation
and
a
fluid
feel
overall
a
substandard
vienna
lager
one
that
just
comes
across
as
offthemark
to
me
problematic
on
many
fronts
the
beer
in
extremely
very
few
ways
resembles
a
vienna
lager
if
this
is
the
style
you
seek
then
youll
find
great
favor
in
samuel
adams
lager
negra
modelo
and
flying
dog
old
scratch
but
if
you
want
a
real
delight
great
lakes
eliot
ness
is
a
mustwin
choice
o
this
beer
seems
to
be
a
little
too
malty
and
sweet
for
the
style
it
could
use
a
little
more
bitterness
from
the
hops
its
easy
to
drink
but
im
not
sure
if
i
would
have
another
one
of
these
o
much
more
amber
than
vienna
ill
pass
in
the
future

overall
good

decent

o
ive
had
my
share
of
this
style
this
is
middle
of
the
road
at
best
i
have
plenty
of
local
options
that
are
superior
i
dont
see
myself
revisiting
this
beer
zum
wohl
d
maybe
not
my
first
choice
bit
its
an
easily
drinkable
and
enjoyable
beer
overall
not
a
bad
beer
but
nothing
stands
out
either
to
sum
it
up
in
a
word
its
forgettable
the
flavors
seem
to
compete
with
each
other
no
real
defining
characteristic
id
drink
it
again
if
offered
for
sure
but
i
wouldnt
buy
it
a
great
tasting
to
lager
overall
im
surprised
at
how
well
i
liked
this
one
the
smell
and
taste
of
sweetness
is
present
without
being
overdone
highly
drinkable
recommended
not
a
bad
beer
but
the
malt
and
hop
character
seem
to
be
at
odds
for
the
style
its
a
little
sweet
this
probably
wont
be
a
beer
that
i
seek
out
again
overall
not
a
really
exciting
beer
but
not
half
bad
also
not
worth
getting
again
overall
its
a
pretty
good
red
but
isnt
outstanding
in
any
way
note
live
review
overall
im
not
sure
why
they
didnt
blow
up
this
style
to
a
bigger
beer
there
are
good
flavors
here
but
really
this
is
one
of
the
most
pedestrian
craft
beers
ever
not
that
great
an
example
of
the
style
pass
on
this
one
lack
any
real
flavor
or
depth
conclusion
this
isnt
a
bad
lager
but
it
seems
to
lack
a
clean
crispness
that
the
best
of
this
style
have
amber
lagers
can
be
quite
tasty
under
the
right
conditions
the
flavors
i
can
taste
are
good
but
they
dont
mesh
as
well
as
they
could
o
good
malt
character
needs
a
little
carbonation
dr
cheap
enough
and
pretty
drinkable
but
a
bit
too
close
to
watery
for
my
tastes
i
wont
have
it
again
but
serious
fans
of
the
style
might
enjoy
it
onot
sure
about
this
one
it
was
not
good
but
not
bad
just
okay
had
this
at
a
cuban
restaurant
and
it
went
nicely
with
some
salty
sweet
plantain
chips
definitely
worth
pairing
with
something
as
on
its
own
it
was
a
little
harsh
and
dirty
but
the
salt
contrast
made
this
plenty
ok
picked
this
up
at
a
resort
better
than
the
ghastly
bud
light
lime
offering
and
fun
to
drink
a
local
but
pretty
uneventful
much
like
that
movie
trouble
with
the
curve
drink
just
an
average
beer
nice
to
try
a
local
but
wouldnt
seek
this
out
o
a
very
meh
beer
easy
drinking
and
forgettable
but
i
drank
it
pretty
fast
so
at
least
it
is
smooth
pours
a
golden
amber
with
a
1
finger
head
that
dissipates
quickly
aroma
of
some
malt
and
yeast
a
hint
of
grass
to
it
tastes
grainy
and
one
dimensional
no
sweetness
or
hop
flavor
overly
carbonated
harsh
and
watered
down
not
impressed
with
this
o
pretty
drinkable
if
very
average
lager
goes
well
with
sushi
but
unremarkable
otherwise
i
like
my
second
pint
better
than
my
first
which
couldnt
stand
up
to
the
spicy
food
i
paired
it
with
overall
ok
glad
i
do
no
have
a
6
pack
of
it
but
nice
to
have
tried
i
think
this
beer
may
have
been
defunct
for
a
while
maybe
not
but
i
havent
seen
it
around
in
a
few
years
the
brew
pours
a
rich
brassy
golden
hue
and
is
capped
with
an
inch
of
moderatelived
white
head
that
settles
to
a
covering
film
spotty
lace
is
deposited
the
nose
doesnt
do
much
except
avoid
offense
and
comply
with
style
norms
there
is
not
a
tremendous
amount
of
character
expressed
int
the
aroma
the
flavor
however
is
explosive
by
comparison
it
is
also
very
tasty
this
bottle
must
be
fairly
fresh
because
it
has
a
good
deal
of
sublime
and
dynamic
hoppiness
herbal
and
grassy
notes
are
initially
observed
on
the
palate
but
they
turn
to
piney
and
cannabislike
on
the
finish
the
malt
is
very
pale
and
mineraly
at
first
aka
55f
despite
the
relatively
rich
hue
as
it
warms
and
airs
out
notes
of
caramel
and
ripe
fruit
come
through
the
feel
is
light
and
refreshing
offering
soft
carbonation
and
mediumlight
body
overall
i
am
stunned
by
this
brew
as
i
did
not
expect
it
to
be
anything
better
than
mediocre
at
best
based
on
my
recollection
it
is
pretty
close
to
everything
i
would
want
from
a
straightforward
lager
excepting
the
vagueness
of
the
aroma
and
it
is
definitely
a
case
of
the
whole
being
better
than
the
sum
of
its
parts
delta
lounge
tampa
airport
d
easy
to
drink
but
the
overall
lack
of
flavor
does
not
lead
me
to
want
another
one
d
easy
to
put
these
down
good
beer
for
kicking
back
and
in
the
fall
gets
the
amber
lager
idea
across
without
being
too
malty
for
certain
peoples
tastes
drinks
okay
but
nothing
to
write
home
about
not
too
clean
for
a
lager
the
dms
cooked
veggies
comes
out
a
bit
too
long
subpar
compared
to
their
counterparts
whom
they
are
trying
to
emulate
there
are
far
better
import
and
craft
lagers
out
there
to
even
think
about
bothering
with
this
one
d
very
drinkable
better
than
most
d
ok
but
not
a
great
brew
lacks
staying
power
fairly
drinkable
its
not
fantastic
but
it
could
find
a
place
in
my
line
up
poured
a
goldenreddish
tint
with
medium
thick
white
head
that
lasted
thru
mid
glass
yet
left
little
lacing
aroma
and
taste
were
both
very
muted
yet
what
was
there
was
a
fruity
hop
smooth
drinking
and
thirst
quenching
i
found
this
to
not
have
too
many
characteristics
good
or
bad
an
average
beer

around

but
fairly

very
easy
going
down
i
cant
really
comment
on
the
appearance
as
i
drank
it
from
the
bottle
although
i
did
like
the
label
how
it
had
this
rating
scale
for
hops
darkness
and
drinkability
i
think
it
hit
middle
of
the
range
in
all
of
those
i
actually
picked
this
up
in
ybor
city
and
after
seeing
what
looked
like
could
be
a
gang
scuffle
i
promptly
headed
pack
to
my
hotel
to
enjoy
the
beer
and
avoid
getting
shot
anyway
the
beer
was
good
but
im
not
going
to
go
out
of
my
way
to
get
it
i
would
like
to
try
some
of
their
other
beers
on
another
trip
to
tampa
i
felt
it
was
very
drinkable
and
fits
well
into
that
bavarian
style
other
comments
an
ok
lager
but
nothing
to
spend
time
seeking
out
drinkability
quite
drinkable
would
not
kick
this
beer
out
of
bed
for
eating
crackers
body
is
light
and
airy
very
refreshing
and
fitting
for
a
warmweather
beer
i
have
to
say
even
in
december
this
is
a
nice
refreshing
thirstquenching
ale
thats
perfect
for
the
florida
climate
md
the
beer
had
a
medium
body
with
maybe
a
little
too
much
carbonation
overall
the
beer
is
really
not
that
good
and
i
did
not
finish
the
second
one
that
i
ordered
drinkability
easy
to
drink
i
guess
if
this
is
your
thing
but
very
forgetable

this

i
think
that
the

is

in

and
that
the
additions
were
too
little
too
late
other
than
this
reminisecent
of

the
taste
had
hints

and
a

its

in

id
gladly
buy

what
do
i
do
with
the
rest
of
the
six
pack
picked
this
up
at
a
resort
in
florida
better
than
most
of
the
stuff
in
the
fridge
but
well
below
some
of
the
good
lagers
i
have
had
flavor
brings
this
one
back
though
with
an
odd
tinge
of
tropical
fruit
rounding
out
the
toasted
grains
seems
quite
wellbalanced
and
not
overmalted
as
some
lagers
can
be
i
say
this
ones
solid
and
well
worthy
this
pours
a
clear
amber
color
with
a
slight
foamy
head
the
aroma
has
grains
malts
and
a
bit
of
spicy
hops
the
flavor
is
full
of
cheap
grains
reminding
me
of
busch
or
genuine
draft
but
this
is
a
little
better
tasting
very
simple
and
plain
as
its
nothing
out
of
the
ordinary
other
than
a
basic
local
beer
brown
tinted
amber
minimal
head
on
the
pour
scent
brings
notes
of
sweet
malt
extract
with
faint
stale
hopping
taste
carries
over
from
scent
lightly
bitter
and
earthy
sweet
but
not
overly
flavorful
medium
bodied
some
heft
and
lacking
in
carbonation
nothing
to
see
here
folks
really
couldnt
distinguish
this
from
one
of
my
early
homebrew
recipes
these
guys
must
be
starting
out
in
the
craft
business
if
this
is
their
lager
offering
got
3
bottles
as
part
of
a
monthly
beer
club
i
guess
ill
drink
them
also
got
key
west
ale
in
the
shipment
which
is
also
by
florida
beer
hope
it
is
an
improvement
overall
a
pretty
tasty
lager
very
drinkable
and
a
nice
blend
between
sweet
and
malty
not
bad
httpwww

comkajiisbeerreviews
this
is
a
medium
bodied
lightly
carbonated
offering
it
is
fairly
easy
drinking
adjunct
lager
of
sorts
that
was
worth
it
to
say
i
had
it
under
other
circumstances
i
probably
would
have
hated
this
but
in
the
hot
sun
it
wasnt
bad
o
a
decent
vienna
lager
nice
to
try
to
see
the
local
take
on
the
style
and
a
good
update
to
their
ybor
gold
amber
lager
you
can
find
better
takes
on
the
style
though
overall
very
good
but
not
outstanding
o
just
a
great
example
of
a
craft
brewery
doing
a
goodtogreat
job
with
all
their
beers
this
one
is
nudging
great
highly
drinkable
with
a
wonderful
malty
bready
presence
and
just
the
right
amount
of
caramel
sweetness
good
work
on
this
one
snake
river
fresh
from
the
brewery
doesnt
hurt
either
this
is
a
decent
brew
the
flavors
mesh
very
well
but
dont
give
a
large
complexity
it
is
smooth
but
maybe
to
the
point
of
being
slightly
watery
oreally
good
lager
liked
the
style
and
would
drink
more
of
this
my
superior
was
kind
enough
to
bring
a
snake
river
lager
back
with
him
from
a
vacation
out
in
the
jhole
the
beer
poured
a
very
nice
clear
copper
with
thin
white
head
that
is
leaving
a
spot
lace
the
scent
and
taste
is
powered
by
malts
there
is
a
nice
caramel
sweetness
that
keeps
one
wanting
more
the
mouthfeel
is
lighter
in
body
with
good
carbonation
overall
this
is
a
great
session
ale
and
wish
i
had
more
than
just
one
this
is
a
pretty
decent
lager
the
only
thing
id
point
out
about
it
that
i
dont
totally
like
is
that
it
is
quite
malty
sweet
really
too
sweet
id
have
to
say
feel
is
smooth
easy
enough
to
drink
but
i
could
do
with
a
better
rounding
on
the
flavor
profile
o
a
flavorful
lager
with
a
good
balance
of
flavor
and
a
creamy
body
it
a
good
beer
o
i
liked
this
beer
because
it
was
dominated
by
sweet
malty
flavors
but
wasnt
that
difficult
to
drink
because
the
mouthfeel
wasnt
too
heavy
an
ok
lager
way
too
sweet
almost
tastes
old
o
this
beer
is
easy
to
drink
and
sessionable
i
think
it
is
one
of
the
better
american
vienna
lagers
i
have
had
recently
definitely
one
i
would
get
again
and
love
the
fact
that
it
is
available
in
cans
makes
it
a
great
choice
for
outdoor
summer
activities
o
its
not
bad
this
is
a
beer
i
would
enjoy
while
eating
pizza
washes
down
your
food
with
decent
taste
and
nothing
offensive
this
is
the
first
vienna
lager
i
have
reviewed
in
over
3
years
nice
to
see
another
example
of
the
style
although
nowhere
near
as
good
as
eliot
ness
although
it
looks
and
smells
like
a
great
beer
the
flavor
seems
weak
and
slightly
out
of
place
and
the
mouthfeel
is
almost
competing
with
pbr
i
would
drink
this
in
a
pinch
while
traveling
through
the
yellowstone
area
but
can
think
of
numerous
local
beers
id
select
over
it
o
overall
paint
me
impressed
snake
river
steps
to
the
plate
again
hell
of
a
beer
worth
checking
out
even
if
you
dont
dig
lagers
this
one
might
turn
you
around
for
the
style
i
couldnt
imagine
this
beer
being
any
better
poured
from
undated
can
to
a
mug
this
beer
arrives
a
translucent
copper
color
with
a
one
finger
light
tan
head
with
decent
retention
though
little
lacing
the
nose
is
mild
and
rather
nondescript
though
hints
of
toasted
malt
and
a
hint
of
lager
yeast
not
much
to
report
really
not
bad
just
not
there
the
flavor
is
more
pronounced
with
a
mild
pilsner
toast
malt
flavor
mild
earthy
hops
sweet
but
not
overly
so
lighter
bodied
and
creamy
overall
this
isnt
my
favorite
not
bad
just
not
a
lot
going
on
would
be
nice
on
a
hot
summer
day
i
guess
do
what
a
tasty
yet
relatively
low
alcohol
beer
snake
river
continues
to
impress
me
although
this
is
only
my
second
sr
offering
could
contend
with
an
vienna
lager
out
there
definitely
worth
a
pick
up
if
you
are
into
sessionable
beers
o
not
what
i
was
expecting
from
a
lager
wy
tick
overall
while
not
a
taste
altering
beer
it
is
very
drinkable
and
easy
going
the
lightness
of
it
makes
it
appealing
and
certainly
would
go
down
well
at
a
cookout
drinkability
this
is
one
of
those
beers
i
end
up
having
once
a
year
and
afterwards
i
am
glad
i
had
it
but
not
reaching
for
another
the
body
is
light
to
medium
with
a
fairly
creamy
feel
the
carbonation
is
light
but
effective
the
finish
is
a
bit
oily
until
the
very
end
not
much
going
on
with
this
one
pours
brings
a
copperred
brew
that
is
mostly
transparent
with
some
visible
carbonation
thin
white
head
without
too
much
retention
power
some
spotty
lacing
on
the
sides
of
the
glass
the
nose
brings
forward
a
brew
with
a
bit
of
oxidation
along
with
some
light
amber
malt
and
bread
crust
the
flavor
falls
along
the
same
lines
there
is
some
doughy
malt
sweetness
and
a
hint
of
toffee
very
mild
earthy
hop
presence
lingering
in
the
background
medium
body
with
okay
carbonation
and
a
bit
of
an
off
finish
drinks
decently
enough
though
im
not
a
huge
fan
final
notes
a
lager
that
drinks
like
an
ale
full
flavored
full
bodied
and
delicious
a
great
utility
beer
it
would
pair
well
with
just
about
any
food
you
throw
at
it
give
it
a
try
beer
is
medium
in
body
and
a
little
flavorless
no
aftertaste
minimal
sweetness
on
the
front
and
a
clean
wet
finish
its
heavier
than
i
expected
but
unoffensive
a
decent
lager
poured
a
deep
amber
color
not
much
head
at
all
smells
a
bit
of
caramel
good
scent
not
too
strong
rich
caramel
flavor
throughout
this
is
a
pretty
good
beer
i
could
drink
a
few
more
of
these
not
my
favorite
beer
but
definitely
worth
a
try
not
much
of
fan
of
this
after
the
brewery
hype
id
love
to
try
some
of
their
other
offerings
but
this
is
one
worth
skipping
d
this
is
a
little
too
heavy
to
be
a
superb
session
lager
but
its
a
pretty
solid
vienna
all
the
same
i
think
i
like
eliot
ness
a
bit
more
but
its
nice
to
see
another
american
brewers
making
this
style
of
brew
this
one
pours
a
deep
orangered
color
the
finger
of
foam
fades
away
in
a
moderate
fashion
the
smell
is
of
caramel
malts
and
there
are
some
orange
zest
and
clove
spices
the
taste
is
a
bit
off
there
are
plenty
of
malts
but
there
is
a
watery
ironlike
taste
that
seems
to
ruin
what
would
be
a
good
flavor
the
mouthfeel
is
ok
its
carbonated
to
the
right
about
with
good
viscosity
for
the
style
its
pretty
drinkable
but
the
off
parts
of
the
flavor
seem
to
dictate
that
its
not
as
drinkable
as
it
could
be
man
this
is
one
toasty
beer
perhaps
a
bit
too
much
after
a
while
the
toasty
flavors
tend
to
dominate
and
overwhelm
each
sip
a
bit
less
would
allow
the
hops
to
shine
through
cleaning
things
up
and
providing
some
more
balance
that
said
this
is
a
lager
worth
seeking
out
and
trying
another
vdubb
appointee
in
the
ongoing
leaving
falls
church
uberbender
it
pours
a
clear
russet
topped
by
a
halffinger
of
offwhite
foam
the
nose
comprises
greens
flowers
butternut
squash
and
a
healthy
contingent
of
toffee
the
taste
is
similar
but
tends
more
toward
mandarin
orange
notes
than
florals
the
toffee
is
more
of
a
sweeter
caramel
now
as
well
with
some
leftover
butter
spread
over
the
proceedings
the
body
is
a
very
light
medium
with
a
light
moderate
carbonation
and
a
smooth
feel
overall
a
nice
sessionable
brew
something
i
could
see
myself
downing
regularly
in
the
mountains
of
wyoming
i
appreciate
malty
beers
and
i
appreciate
this
one
but
it
feels
to
me
that
bitterness
should
be
expressed
a
tad
more
for
this
style
perhaps
this
is
a
more
traditional
representation
of
the
style
in
any
case
this
is
a
beer
worth
trying
copper
colored
brew
somewhat
hazy
nice

toasted

some

im
not
recalling
a
viennas
relationship
to
ta
oktober
at
the
moment
but
this
reminds
me
of
a
german
oktober
medium
mouth
not
bad
overall
actually
pretty
good
had
this
beer
at
the
brewery
a
couple
of
weeks
ago
the
orangebrown
color
was
a
nice
indication
of
the
type
of
taste
it
was
going
to
bring
the
caramel
malt
is
nice
and
strong
and
this
beer
is
a
very
good
example
of
a
vienna
lager
carbonation
was
at
a
great
level
having
it
on
tapand
though
i
wouldnt
say
that
it
is
quite
on
the
level
of
the
eliot
ness
from
great
lakes
its
still
a
great
beer
i
think
that
darker
lagers
are
often
one
of
the
most
overlooked
beers
i
didnt
pick
up
on
any
of
the
vinegary
taste
that
was
mentioned
in
the
earlier
review
but
i
did
catch
a
great
balance
of
hop
and
malt
and
i
would
like
to
try
it
in
the
bottle
to
see
the
differences
the
mild
vinegar
taste
and
aroma
is
not
one
that
i
normally
associate
with
any
beer
however
it
worked
pretty
well
and
added
an
unusual
nuance
to
the
flavor
this
beer
pours
a
murky
amberorange
color
the
head
is
a
firm
inch
of
white
foam
that
recedes
slowly
into
sticky
lacing
the
aroma
is
of
sweet
malt
with
a
strong
floral
hop
presence
it
isnt
the
most
complex
aroma
ive
experienced
in
a
vienna
lager
but
it
is
nice
nonetheless
the
taste
is
a
lot
like
the
aroma
all
the
residual
sugars
make
it
almost
hide
all
the
the
usual
lager
cleanness
and
make
it
almost
seem
like
and
amber
ale
what
is
there
is
nice
and
quite
interesting
the
mouthfeel
is
medium
bodied
with
a
gritty
texture
and
moderate
carbonation
overall
this
is
a
nice
beer
that
i
would
surely
drink
again
for
me
i
am
a
larger
fan
but
lagers
do
not
have
the
flavors
i
look
for
when
i
drink
a
beer
up
in
the
teton
mountains
dusty
caramel
colored
body
bubbly
dirty
white
head
lace
is
decent
enough
nice
thick
aroma
of
toasted
malts
caramel
and
nuts
flavor
falls
short
of
the
nose
by
a
bit
earthy
maltiness
with
sweet
toffeeish
tones
toasted
dusty
malts
add
a
layer
to
the
flavor
fairly
bland
overall
medium
to
mediumfull
body
moderately
carbonated
kind
of
a
dusty
chalky
mouthfeel
this
is
decent
but
nothing
id
need
to
return
to
in
the
near
future
dnice
flavorful
vienna
lager
that
would
be
a
great
summer
session
beer
d
one
of
the
first
vienna
lagers
ive
had
in
a
while
it
reminded
me
why
i
liked
them
so
much
to
begin
with
its
flavorful
and
round
a
good
session
beer
but
not
one
that
impresses
hugely
picked
up
a
single
from
princeton
liquors
in
maple
grove
mn
appears
a
clear
copper
with
an
offwhite
head
and
lacing
this
vienna
lager
was
simple
and
smooth
witha
plain
caramel
malt
flavor
and
just
a
hint
of
earth
hops
in
the
aftertaste
very
drinkable
but
not
that
inspiring
its
like
a
richer
negra
modelo
drank
this
one
on
its
no
food
d
not
quite
a
session
beer
but
a
really
good
lager
definitely
try
it
if
you
enjoy
this
style
opinion
well
this
is
an
alright
beer
and
i
am
sure
that
it
was
better
in
its
prime
there
isnt
really
anything
wrong
with
it
so
that
is
why
i
think
that
it
would
have
been
better
fresher
my
score
will
have
to
reflect
what
i
am
drinking
but
i
would
hold
out
hope
that
i
will
get
to
give
this
one
another
try
and
a
more
fair
review
pours
a
very
clear
golden
amber
in
color
lighter
than
id
expect
for
the
style
topped
with
an
off
white
head
and
minimal
lacing
chill
haze
nose
is
light
sweet
caramel
with
minimal
use
of
aroma
hops
evincing
what
id
call
a
touch
of
lemon
rind
on
the
first
sip
this
is
pretty
light
on
the
palate
with
some
light
tangy
citrus
leading
the
way
followed
by
as
touch
of
pale
malt
and
plenty
of
caramel
malt
notes
caramel
notes
become
much
more
prominent
as
this
warms
yet
dont
detract
from
the
overall
character
and
the
lemon
rindcitrus
from
the
nose
takes
on
more
of
an
orange
character
a
bit
lighter
in
body
than
id
expected
it
is
rather
crisp
and
drinkable
altogether
and
certainly
doesnt
feel
like
6
although
not
a
huge
beer
its
easydrinkining
nature
does
tend
to
put
it
in
with
other
dangerously
drinkable
brews
i
got
a
12oz
bottle
in
a
trade
from
fishdawg71
i
pop
the
top
and
begin
to
pour
it
into
a
16oz
glass
and
i
am
overwhelmed
with
headheh
there
is
easily
about
45
inches
of
head
and
i
have
barely
poured
any
in
yet
anyways
it
comes
out
an
appealing
golden
straw
color
with
quite
a
bit
of
haze
the
foam
on
this
is
absolutely
gorgeous
you
know
thos
nice
lazy
summer
days
when
you
look
up
into
a
vast
blue
sky
and
see
it
plastered
with
thick
puffy
cumulonimbus
clouds
you
know
what
i
mean
yeah
think
of
that
only
in
a
glass
it
also
collapses
in
a
very
unique
way
it
doesnt
dissipate
evenly
instead
it
partially
falls
and
im
left
with
a
mountain
of
head
its
been
about
five
minutes
and
im
still
letting
this
beast
do
its
thing
the
first
thing
i
smell
is
alcohol
and
lots
of
it
theres
a
pretty
dominant
backbone
of
breadlike
malts
which
smells
absolutely
delicious
probably
not
surprising
but
this
beer
tastes
much
like
smells
plenty
of
alcohol
and
malt
with
very
little
hops
im
certainly
not
complaining
in
fact
i
like
it
it
tastes
pretty
light
on
the
tongue
but
it
has
way
too
much
carbonation
for
my
taste
who
knows
maybe
it
was
a
bad
batch
id
definitely
try
this
one
again
pours
almost
like
a
true
pale
ale
surprising
how
good
this
looks
the
head
isnt
as
attractive
but
the
sheer
color
is
nice
incredibly
malty
on
the
nose
almost
like
a
nice
sweet
pastry
not
much
of
a
hop
presence
noticed
yet
a
very
interesting
mouthfeel
that
is
creamy
yet
very
light
low
carbonation
that
gives
way
to
biscuits
and
sweet
caramel
not
much
more
i
can
say
rather
than
its
quite
drinkable
and
somewhat
complex
drinkability
also
great
ive
had
many
nights
of
drinking
10
of
these
the
only
problem
is
the
accumulation
of
sourness
but
while
youre
drinking
this
its
a
5
on
drinkability
good
carbonation
good
finish
easy
drinking
thanks
younger35
for
the
opportunity
drink
more
lagers
that
was
the
admonishment
as
i
left
boston
and
i
was
merely
following
orders
it
came
with
a
decent
bonewhite
head
exploding
with
lots
of
co2
bubbles
the
color
was
a
beautiful
deepgold
with
nequality
clarity
the
nose
had
the
characteristic
lagermalt
sweetness
the
mouthfeel
was
thintomedium
there
was
a
good
malty
sweetness
on
the
tongue
finish
had
a
good
lingering
sweetness
a
really
good
lager
as
long
as
you
like
lagers
and
i
was
learning
to
do
just
that
everyone
loves
zonker
but
the
vienna
lager
is
my
favorite
snake
river
brew
fantastic
the
beer
pours
a
nice
clear
deep
golden
color
with
a
thick
and
sticky
white
head
the
aroma
is
moderately
malty

kind
of
spicy
and
a
little
sweet
the
flavor
is
well
balanced
between
moderate
malyiness
and
mediumlow
hop
bitterness
there
even
is
a
touch
of
spicy
hop
flavor
the
swallow
is
smooth
a
bit
metallic
the
carbonation
is
moderate
and
body
is
a
bit
thinwatery
overall
not
a
bad
beer
could
use
a
bit
more
body
and
complexity
still
not
bad
pours
apricot
in
color
with
a
cream
head
that
dies
slow
smells
of
sweet
malt
tastes
a
little
caramel
and
some
fruit
sweetness
finishes
with
a
minor
hop
bite
as
balanced
and
subtle
as
a
brew
gets
light
and
crisp
in
the
mouth
goes
down
smooth
and
easy
notes
on
the
sweet
and
malty
side
fresh
flavorful
and
lively
pack
in
a
tight
and
clean
palate
a
beer
i
will
unquestionably
regard
as
one
of
the
best
in
its
style
thanks
to
bitterbill
for
including
this
one
bottom
line
a
most
excellent
in
all
ways
example
of
the
style
i
can
only
recommend
it
i
can
see
why
this
is
listed
as
a
märzenofest
as
thats
really
what
it
reminds
me
of
granted
i
havent
had
too
many
viennas
but
this
one
stands
as
a
wonderful
beer
no
matter
the
style
now
that
i
can
get
this
anywhere
i
think
this
will
be
my
new
always
in
the
fridge
beer
d
very
enjoyable
lager
a
good
alloccasion
beer
i
had
mine
with
a
salad
and
they
complimented
each
other
nicely
i
agree
with
the
recategorization
from
vienna
lager
to
marzen
style
its
a
rather
interesting
and
decent
brew
regardless
a
beautiful
thick
honey
hazy
colored
lager
with
a
two
inch
thick
light
tan
head
that
fades
quickly
nice
with
rich
wheaty
feel
and
a
mineral
zest
with
a
hint
of
syrupy
sweetness
mellow
sweetness
enters
the
mouth
with
a
neat
woodsy
feel
on
the
back
of
the
tongue
the
overall
feel
is
very
thin
especially
in
the
finish
but
a
nice
mouthfeel
overall
sweetness
is
long
and
prominate
characteristic
of
this
beer
but
not
overpowering
this
is
a
very
drinkable
and
much
better
beer
than
i
was
expecting
from
the
style
nice
surprise
it
is
an
attractive
brew
with
its
deep
gold
hue
and
average
head
the
aroma
is
barely
there
maybe
some
corn
but
nothing
else
that
i
could
discern
it
has
a
sweet
flavor
of
corn
and
possibly
some
pineapple
once
again
its
okay
but
not
anything
to
write
home
about
if
i
had
to
put
a
label
on
this
id
call
snake
river
lager
an
upscale
budweiser
tried
a
sample
of
this
at
the
brewpub
and
it
really
stood
out
as
outstanding
redundant
i
know
the
thin
head
from
pouring
melts
to
almost
nothing
though
what
is
left
is
quite
active
the
beer
has
a
rich
dark
slightly
cloudy
amber
color
the
malty
nutty
flavor
leaves
a
nutty
aftertaste
as
well
i
really
wish
id
bought
more
to
take
home
with
me
my
gf
keeps
stealing
drinks
from
mine
whoever
listed
this
beer
as
a
marzen
oktoberfest
got
it
kinda
wrong
as
the
lable
states
it
is
a
vienna
lager
and
a
pretty
good
one
at
that
these
beers
tend
to
fall
too
heavily
on
the
grainy
side
leaving
the
bready
yeasty
flavors
and
textures
lacking
this
beer
remains
malty
and
full
with
breadiness
and
fresh
yeast
throughout
all
the
while
resting
on
a
full
mild
amber
malt
base
sweet
with
caramel
and
malt
and
tempered
with
earthy
hops
this
is
a
well
done
beer
lightens
in
the
finish
but
remains
creamy
and
rich
until
then
excellent
mouthfeel
and
drinkability
surprising
mouth
fullness
for
a
light
bodied
beer
without
being
oily
or
filmy
i
started
to
crave
a
big
old
beefy
burger
to
eat
with
this
i
could
drink
these
all
the
time
smooth
and
tasty
maybe
a
little
too
easy
to
drink
mouthfeel
drinkability
the
beer
is
medium
bodied
the
beer
has
ample
carbonation
the
beer
is
on
the
sweeter
side
but
has
a
good
complementing
grassyness
the
beer
is
major
league
drinkable
i
could
suck
these
down
all
day
long
this
has
a
nice
smooth
mouthfeel
and
is
a
very
drinkable
lager
pours
a
halffinger
light
tan
head
over
a
cloudy
golden
yellowtan
liquid
smells
of
almost
nothing

of

i
get
maybe
a
hint
of

wet

with
a

at
the

to
keep
the
beer
in

mango
is
a
gentle
flavor
because
im
searching
i
think
i
do
see
some
vienna
malt
a
touch
of
rust
fruity
and
playful
mdlight
body
and
finebubbled
carbonation
that
comes
on
a
bit
too
strong
not
much
to
say
not
much
to
it
super
drinkability
from
this
underrepresented
style
compares
favorably
to
any
i
drank
in
germany
seek
this
out
d
very
drinkable
this
is
a
different
kind
of
lager
a
nice
one
at
that
clear
light
honeybrown
body
with
an
airy
white
2finger
head
that
subsides
to
a
thin
layer
and
lacing
is
quite
patchy
nose
is
on
the
sweet
side
with
caramel
and
maple
notes
and
just
a
bit
of
apple
not
much
action
on
the
tongue
but
quickly
filled
with
a
medium
body
heavy
malt
flavors
with
a
touch
of
bread
and
fruits
again
hops
not
all
that
evident
until
grassy
notes
emerge
and
subside
as
quickly
after
it
goes
down
smooth
fairly
light
and
refreshing
for
the
style
easygoing
not
spectacular
but
a
solid
offering
that
makes
for
a
good
session
notes
nothing
special

ounce

with

the
tangy
fruit
flavor
is
more
pronounced
than
in
most
beers
of
the
style
quite
hoppy
too
i
really
enjoy
the
balance
of
flavors
in
this
beer
its
not
really
typical
to
style
but
who
cares
between
this
beer
and
the
zonker
stout
snake
river
appears
to
be
an
impressive
brewery
drinkability
needs
something
like
some
heavier
malt
or
something
to
tie
this
together
kind
of
blad
tasting
overall
this
is
quite
the
easy
drinking
enjoyable
brew
one
i
wouldnt
mind
buying
another
sixer

now
im
curious
to
try

good
beer
this
beer
tastes
like
a
cross
between
an
oktoberfest
and
a
pale
ale
thanks
to
the
relatively
generous
amount
of
hops
that
may
be
anathema
to
purists
of
the
style
but
to
this
hophead
its
a
fine
thing
indeed
although
it
doesnt
rise
to
the
lofty
heights
of
zonker
stout
snake
river
lager
is
pretty
good
beer
in
its
own
right
drinkability
one
to
seek
out
imo
ive
only
had
a
couple
vienna
style
lagers
this
one
is
tops
clear
copperygold
in
hue
a
white
head
reached
a
modest
half
finger
in
height
noticeable
animation
the
head
retention
was
superior
it
took
a
good
moment
before
it
faded
noticeably
the
nose
has
good
potency
for
a
lager
easily
noticeable
maltiness
well
rounded
a
touch
of
toastiness
too
with
earthy
hoppiness
behind
the
malt
the
aromas
are
expected
for
the
style
and
quite
inviting
i
really
enjoyed
the
flavors
on
the
palate
the
hop
flavors
on
the
tongue
are
livelier
than
the
nose
indicated
the
bitterness
is
pronounced
and
crisp
vaguely
earthy
but
more
so
flowery
the
maltiness
is
clean
but
equally
flavorful
with
caramel
and
toasty
bread
notes
the
finish
is
a
blend
of
the
afore
mentioned
flavors
it
is
very
nice
this
was
a
pleasant
quaff
and
ideally
refreshing
and
flavorful
the
body
is
medium
crisp
and
firm
carbonation
that
leads
to
a
sturdy
mouthfeel
this
is
a
nice

comprises
the
sweetness
quite
appetizing
aromawise
but
theres
a
trace
acidic
sourness
that
precludes
excellence
flavorwise
the
dominant
malt
components
are
of
lightly

vienna
malt
with
a
sweeter
more
grainy
munich
edge
agreeably
understated
medium

bitterness
is
mild
perhaps
overly
so
and
leaves
residual
sweetness
uncontested
mellow
floral
and
herbal
hop
flavor
complements
malt
backbone
unfortunately
theres
a
hint
of
husky
tannins
that
carries
an
slight
but
obtrusive
astringency
moderately
bodied
with
a
firm
dextrinous
and

becomes

nonetheless
nice
brewpub
good
beer
this
lager
labeled
as
a
vienna
pours
a
light
copper
with
a
white
head
sweet
malts
on
the
nose
with
some
very
light
hop
backing
its
all
about
the
malt
taste
is
more
of
the
caramelly
slightly
spicy
malt
goes
down
very
easily
finish
is
smooth
and
slightly
bitter
i
found
this
to
be
a
disappointing
vienna
style
lager
that
missed
on
several
counts
though
the
body
had
a
decent
honey
amber
look
to
it
there
was
virtually
no
head
whatsoever
this
followed
through
in
a
lack
of
lacing
the
nose
was
fully
malty
and
that
was
one
of
its
stronger
points
the
taste
was
not
unpleasant
nor
was
it
enjoyable
there
was
an
astringency
to
the
mouthfeel
that
i
did
not
enjoy
id
drink
this
beer
if
there
was
only
macro
available
but
i
would
not
seek
it
out
dayton
oh
alefestthis
beer
had
a
small
sized
ivory
head
with
finesmall
bubbles
that
was
mostly
lasting
it
had
a
clear
body
along
with
some
lively
carbonation
the
hue
was
orange
and
the
nose
was
malty
and
hoppy
this
beers
flavor
was
sweet
and
bitter
tasting
the
mouthfeel
was
smooth
thin
and
somewhat
watery
this
beer
left
excellent
lacing
on
the
sides
of
my
glass
this
beer
was
not
one
of
my
favorites
it
was
basically
a
little
below
average
there
was
a
little
too
much
hoppiness
in
in
it
for
me
it
went
ok
with
a
roast
beef
sandwich
though
there
really
was
not
anything
very
special
about
this
brew
it
did
have
a
decent
head
on
it
i
love
a
beer
with
a
good
lookin
head
on
it
disappointed
will
leave
me
reminiscing
about
my
trip
to
jackson
wy
poors
with
a
nice
cloudy
dark
amber
body
with
a
thick
frothy
head
it
has
a
wonderful
sweet
malty
aroma
with
some
nice
subtle
grain
and
hops
notes
it
has
a
light
sweet
malty
flover
with
a
pleasant
sweet
followthrough
hinting
of
hops
and
fruit
a
wonderful
light
mouthfeel
as
well
very
drinkable
and
highly
recommended
yes
sir
i
liked
it
i
liked
it
a
whole
bunch
color
of
amber
but
with
a
nice
hazy
brown
tint
along
with
a
nice
offwhite
head
that
was
pretty
thick
and
frothy
smell
is
lightly
hinted
but
so
good
and
fresh
had
a
nice
caramel
malt
and
hop
presence
it
was
soft
on
the
nose
and
very
pleasing
sip
slurp
ahhhh
so
good
great
medium
body
feel
and
tight
with
flavor
smooth
toasty
malt
with
just
the
right
touch
of
hop
bitterness
but
the
malt
is
left
to
really
stand
out
everything
comes
together
so
nicely
the
finish
is
a
touch
sweet
very
nicely
done
toasty
fresh
robustand
flavorful
packed
nicely
with
a
6
punch
this
is
one
awesome
vienna
style
beer
one
of
the
best
ive
ever
had
the
pleasure
of
drinking
very
drinkable
and
enjoyable
highly
recommend
picking
some
up
if
ever
in
jackson
holewyoming

this
nice
light
coppercolored
brew
has
a
nice
foamy
head
and
light
malt
aroma
the
flavor
is
light
but
not
too
light
with
a
nice
barely
hint
of
roasted
malt
clean
finish
the
server
said
this
is
her
absolute
favorite
stellar
brew
all
around
highly
recommended
no
good
tastes
like
liquid
tree
a
little
yeasty
and
dry
on
the
back
pallet
maybe
a
bit
too
effervescent
solid
beer
to
drink
like
yuengling
i
had
this
served
to
me
on
tap
at
harpoon
larrys
dark
amber
with
no
head
to
speak
up
minimal
lacing
smell
is
faint
wheat
and
malts
the
taste
was
slightly
floral
with
some
hoppiness
on
the
tongue
but
it
didnt
hit
me
with
the
same
bang
that
eliot
ness
did
a
while
back
the
mouthfeel
is
pretty
solid
with
medium
body
and
a
decent
bite
on
the
back
of
the
tongue
overall
this
is
a
slightly
above
average
vienna
yup
if
enjoyability
was
a
catagory
or
a
word
it
would
be
a
5
the
is
the
ultimate
vienna
lager
the
great
taste
is
memorable
and
this
is
the
one
i
measure
all
other
vienna
lagers
against
light
carbonation
with
a
great
flavor
good
dark
red
lager
low
abv
so
really
nice
on
a
work
night
o
the
smell
and
taste
are
pleasant
and
this
beer
is
quite
drinkable
a
little
lacking
in
the
appearance
but
otherwise
good
smooth
and
very
drinkable
makes
me
hoppy
pint
at
county
grill
in
yorktown
with
family
and
ronnie
donna
smooth
vienna
lager
thats
one
of
my
goto
beers
to
have
in
my
kegerator
as
its
not
too
dark
nor
too
light
for
guests
overall
this
is
good
stuff
whether
on
its
own
or
with
a
meal
and
seems
to
pair
better
with
food
compared
to
the
other
viennastyle
lagers
ive
tried
so
farim
not
sure
what
makes
the
difference
there
maybe
the
particular
variety
of
hops
used
in
each
one
or
maybe
my
taste
buds
just
like
these
kinds
of
beers
more
with
fish
chips
rather
than
with
spicy
chicken
tacos
but
it
was
definitely
appreciated
at
lunch
today
smooth
and
refreshing
malty
lager
just
what
im
looking
for
in
the
style
wife
always
picks
a
good
beer
on
her
away
from
fl
and
she
know
nothing
about
beer
just
a
copper
color
beer
thats
a
crisp
taste
but
also
some
hits
of
hops
taste
ans
carmel
smmoth
so
drink
another
serving
type
bottle
cant
believe
i
hadnt
ever
reviewed
this
great
color
and
light
beige
head
smells
lightly
of
caramel
and
crisp
yet
not
overpowering
hops
sweet
caramel
pops
just
before
a
bitter
taming
from
the
hops
comes
around
smooth
and
slightly
light
mouthfeel
finish
is
clean
no
cloying
sweetness
in
aftertaste
great
all
around
drinker
for
almost
any
situation
and
fantastic
gateway
beer
for
your
macro
friends
hot
damn
i
can
see
why
this
has
garnered
a
couple
gabf
medals
it
holds
a
rich
deep
malt
character
over
a
crisp
dry
body
its
deeply
delicious
and
satisfying
and
also
oh
so
drinkable
the
barley
brings
a
sweet
caramel
note
with
toasty
bread
crust
smooth
husk
and
a
hint
of
fruit
juice
in
the
finish
great
beer
go
find
it
would
definitely
try
again
thought
that
this
was
an
ok
beer
nothing
too
much
exciting
about
itmalt
sweetness
is
about
it
with
muted
flavors
otherwise
however
it
doesnt
offend
either
which
is
better
than
many
beers
very
drinkable
with
a
low
abv
and
if
i
ran
into
again
i
would
consider
it
there
is
a
place
in
the
world
for
good
yet
boring
beer
not
a
lager
fan
generally
but
this
is
about
as
good
as
lager
gets
in
my
opinion
i
am
on
a
work
trip
in
va
so
i
am
devoted
to
drinking
as
many
hard
to
find
breweries
as
i
can
went
to
the
tap
room
in
reston
and
shawn
the
bartender
recommended
this
he
was
reaching
as
the
loose
cannon
was
all
gone
anyways
had
this
since
it
was
a
low
abv
need
to
be
responsible
especially
since
the
next
3
beers
may
not
be
as
kind
anyways
this
beer
was
a
little
wispy
no
head
golden
amber
color
not
a
hop
to
be
found
crispy
and
wet
i
will
give
it
that
if
there
was
a
fire
i
would
immediately
think
to
get
this
beer
my
dislike
has
more
to
do
with
the
vienna
lager
style
i
think
this
was
just
ok
in
my
mind
t
clean
balanced
beer
with
notes
of
grass
honey
wheat
bread
crust
and
toastyness
i
wasnt
terribly
impressed
with
this
beer
it
pours
a
dark
amber
with
a
1
foamy
head
that
dissipates
very
quickly
to
nothing
no
real
lacing
left
along
the
glass
as
you
finish
smell
is
malty
with
a
touch
of
sweetness
but
nothing
really
stands
out
apart
from
the
malt
there
are
slight
hints
of
caramel
but
overall
the
taste
is
very
thin
just
not
much
to
it
by
the
end
of
one
i
was
ready
to
try
something
else
one
of
the
better
examples
of
the
style
i
have
had
in
a
while
nice
and
malty
i
would
get
a
six
pack
of
this
if
i
saw
it
again
not
a
lot
of
hops
detected
but
finishes
with
just
enough
bitterness
to
balance
out
the
predominantly
sweet
malty
flavors
overall
a
very
drinkable
beer
that
most
will
likely
find
to
be
nonobjectionable
but
not
a
revelation
its
delicate
and
maltydry
finish
is
mediumlight
and
never
challenges
the
palate
its
high
drinkability
and
soothing
texture
develops
into
an
herbal
bitterness
to
finish
thats
only
intense
enough
to
offset
the
trailing
malts
revealing
a
near
minty
flavor
and
feel
in
its
wake
eric
my
aggro
pour
created
a
pseudocascade
that
formed
a
brief
finger
of
tawny
head
that
quickly
exhausted
itself
and
became

was
very
sweet
with
notes
of
maple
syrup
and
clover
honey
mouthfeel
was
on
the
thin
side
very
soft
on
the
tongue
the
taste
was
much
like
the
nose
quite
sweet
with
notes
of
syrup
and
honey
along
with
molasses
and
brown
sugar
finish
was
semisweet
not
quite
as
cloying
as
i
might
have
expected
once
again
this
was
more
of
a
curiosity
for
me
than
anything
else
and
now
my
curiosity
and
thirst
was
satiated
flavor
liquid
bread
is
the
correct
description
of
this
beer
the
bready
malt
is
the
primary
flavor
but
adds
some
caramel
malt
sweetness
and
a
nice
hop
bite
for
balance
there
is
a
burnt
toast
bitterness
that
seems
to
be
common
in
vienna
style
lagers
that
i
have
tried
overall
i
am
not
a
vienna
lager
fan
but
this
beer
is
quite
tasty
glad
i
got
it
as
an
extra
in
a
trade
my
beer
guru
sent
this
one
to
me
to
try
it
was
a
great
pour
carbonated
but
and
overly
sized
head
the
head
stuck
around
and
clung
to
the
glass
i
normally
do
not
care
for
a
clear
beer
but
liked
the
appearance
of
this
one
nothing
interesting
in
smell
decent
tasting
beer
especially
from
someone
who
is
typically
meh
about
lager
overall
a
pretty
good
beer
that
i
enjoyed
one
i
would
enjoy
again
but
not
seek
out
o
not
bad
its
a
respectable
lager
lacking
in
pizzazz
i
wouldnt
buy
again
but
it
would
make
a
solid
goto
in
a
place
with
mostly
just
bmc
overall
nice
take
on
the
vienna
lager
style
i
maintain
that
glbcs
elliot
ness
is
a
better
representation
but
this
is
certainly
a
very
solid
take
on
the
style
o
a
friend
told
me
about
stumbling
upon
the
devils
backbone
breweryrestaurant
during
his
travels
and
spoke
well
of
it
when
i
saw
a
bottle
of
this
beer
i
had
to
try
it
im
not
the
worlds
top
lager
fan
and
this
one
didnt
convert
me
but
its
a
very
drinkable
i
e
sessionable
beer
and
for
the
price
ill
be
buying
a
few
more
to
pair
with
meals
this
beer
is
probably
one
of
my
favorite
lighter
colored
beer
i
have
introduced
it
to
several
friends
and
family
they
all
do
a
double
take
at
the
beer
and
a
mental
note
for
their
shopping
list
devils
backbone
for
me
came
out
of
no
where
and
have
been
producing
a
great
product
poured
from
a
brown
12
oz
bottle
has
a
caramel
color
with
a
12
inch
head
smell
is
mild
some
light
malts
taste
is
crisp
some
toasted
malts
a
bit
of
grains
a
refreshing
and
sessionable
beer
feels
medium
bodied
in
the
mouth
and
overall
is
a
pretty
good
brew
overall
meh
i
dont
even
think
its
that
good
for
a
vienna
its
one
of
those
beers
that
you
can
drink
but
really
not
thinking
about
it
a
nice
german
style
lager
made
in
the
midatlantic
i
do
remember
draft
versions
being
more
malty
and
fantastic
so
it
is
possible
that
the
bottled
version
or
at
least
the
one
i
got
isnt
quite
as
good
oa
very
good
vienna
lager
clean
and
crisp
with
a
spicy
hop
bite
that
lingers
over
the
yeast
pale
malt
and
light
fruit
notes
into
a
spicy
dry
finish
slightly
peppery
with
crisp
earthy
hops
somewhat
floral
with
dank
pine
needle
and
grass
followed
by
bread
biscuit
pilsner
malt
and
light
fruit
notes
theres
some
nice
apple
and
pear
sweetness
comlimenting
the
biscuit
malts
and
crisp
hop
bitterness
nicely
balanced
and
easy
to
drink
nothing
too
out
of
the
ordinary
but
surprisingly
flavorful
and
quite
drinkable
the
beer
is
copper
to
amber
colored
with
a
half
inch
of
head
the
aroma
brings
lager
character
yeast
a
touch
of
fruit
sweet
breads
grain
a
tad
sweet
countered
to
a
small
degree
by
a
touch
of
bitterness
pretty
light
in
body
with
moderate
carbonation
a
nice
complement
to
the
bratwurst
and
sauerkraut
overall
a
decent
lager
that
isnt
sam
adams
and
worth
getting
just
for
some
variety

o
a
nice
simple
vienna
lager
a
little
sweet
and
undercarbonated
for
my
personal
taste
but
one
ill
likely
go
back
to
as
its
strong
overall
tasted
this
at
the
ebbitt
grill
brewhaha
during
dc
beer
week
2013
this
is
a
well
made
lager
that
balances
malt
and
a
sufficient
amount
of
hops
good
balance
and
decent
body
makes
for
a
superb
sessional
beer
hope
to
grab
one
in
a
more
relaxing
setting
next
time
o
sessionable
and
full
of
flavor
reminiscent
of
sa
boston
lager
tastes
even
better
when
served
fresh
from
the
tap
overall
a
very
drinkable
beer
at
4
9
its
got
some
great
flavor
and
even
better
drinkability
the
malts
used
have
a
lot
of
flavor
packed
in
this
vienna
lager
for
sure
i
only
had
one
bottle
from
a
trade
but
i
wish
id
had
another
to
follow
up
poured
a
golden
body
with
a
slight
amber
hue
with
good
head
and
carbonation
that
die
quick
with
little
lace
on
top
of
a
light
aroma
not
much
there
but
pick
up
some
bitter
hops
and
touches
of
caramel
sweetness
light
bodied
easy
to
drink
and
hitting
the
spot
theres
not
much
at
all
going
on
with
this
beer
but
it
is
enjoyable
not
as
bitter
or
dry
as
i
am
accustomed
to
a
good
balance
is
in
here
from
the
dry
floral
hop
notes
to
some
sticky
sweet
caramel
as
said
not
too
much
going
on
here
but
not
a
water
light
beer
either
and
i
cant
complain
overall
this
was
the
second
beer
i
have
had
from
this
brewery
and
this
beer
came
with
alot
of
hype
but
as
very
good
it
will
be
purchased
again
and
it
is
worth
a
try
another
good
transition
beer
for
thos
looking
to
expand
beer
horizons
very
clean
and
goes
down
well
very
well
one
of
the
better
american
lagers
ive
sampled
in
recent
months
overall
a
real
disappointment
i
had
never
heard
of
this
brewery
but
was
hoping
i
might
find
a
hidden
gem
alas
it
was
not
to
be
poured
into
a
becker
a
clear
rich
bronze
with
a
well
defined
half
finger
white
head
that
was
pretty
quick
to
fade
aromas
mainly
of
caramel
doughy
maltflavors
start
out
with
caramel
malt
notes
along
with
a
whiskeyish
element
to
ita
decent
smattering
of
spicy
hops
in
the
finish
a
solid
vienna
lager
not
overly
sweet
with
a
nice
amount
of
hops
a
good
beer
for
yard
work
and
opening
day
tiger
baseball
o
i
can
see
why
this
beer
has
done
so
well
in
numerous
competitions
it
layers
bready
light
caramelly
maltiness
with
a
solid
crisp
hops
bite
and
lightmedium
feel
while
i
like
sa
boston
lager
this
beer
crushes
it
sabl
is
very
heavyhanded
without
much
subtlety
unlike
db
vienna
lager
which
layers
a
complex
number
of
clean
malt
characteristics
with
a
crisp
hops
finish
i
feel
lucky
to
have
this
type
of
highquality
beer
available
in
my
backyard
medium
bodied
with
good
carbonation
very
well
tempered
and
really
good
drinkability
mellow
enough
to
serve
with
near
any
meal
no
overpowering
or
lingering
hop
presence
just
enough
bitterness
to
balance
out
the
sweetness
and
esters
mouthfeel
soft
smooth
chwey
mouthfeel
super
drinkable
wellbalanced
excellent
no
complaints
here
nothing
pushing
the
envelope
exactly
what
it
should
be
o
no
major
flaws
recommendation
is
a
tighter
longer
head
the
nose
could
be
stouter
a
little
more
sweetness
could
happen
and
less
bite
o
devils
backbone
vienna
lager
is
a
maltforward
classic
rendition
of
a
great
german
style
soft
and
smooth
with
a
wellbalanced
malt
sweetness
the
beer
is
easy
drinking
delightfully
simple
but
filled
with
understated
complexities
o
a
refreshing
beer
ive
gone
back
to
it
a
few
times
an
easy
drinker
but
nothing
amazing
this
beer
has
grown
on
me
its
not
spectacular
and
not
as
complex
as
the
beers
im
used
to
drinking
but
it
makes
for
a
very
pleasing
session
a
long
draught
reveals
some
mild
but
stubborn
hoppiness
tight
wiring
up
against
the
sweetness
of
the
caramel
malt
plenty
of
carbonation
but
this
is
still
an
easy
to
drink
fairly
refreshing
beer
simple
in
nature
it
makes
the
most
of
this
style
and
leaves
you
satisfied
i
could
drink
these
all
day
particularly
as
the
fall
progresses
overall
while
rather
simple
in
its
flavors
it
is
quite
delicious
and
refreshing
a
fantastic
session
brew
the
palate
opens
with
a
blend
of
earthy
hop
bitterness
a
little
calciumchalky
mineral
character
and
a
toasty
malt
character
a
little
bit
of
burnt
sugar
toffee
toast
and
bread
are
also
present
all
excellent
flavors
in
great
balance
what
this
beer
does
lack
however
is
a
little
bit
of
body
to
carry
these
flavors
as
it
is
a
little
watery
on
the
midpalate
drying
mildly
bitter
herbal
leafy
on
the
finish
with
a
light
mineral
character
this
beer
is
light
too
light
in
body
and
has
a
mediumhigh
level
of
carbonation
solid
stuff
definitely
worthy
but
i
think
the
sam
adams
boston
lager
is
a
better
alternative
o
a
very
drinkable
beer
well
balanced
and
tasty
o
as
they
say
very
sessionable
and
enjoyable
beer
nothing
groundbreaking
here
but
theyve
done
it
right
and
i
would
likely
purchase
this
from
timetotime
if
i
lived
win
the
distribution
area
til
then
will
have
to
convince
the
sisinlaw
to
bring
me
more
samples
from
this
brewery
this
beer
is
a
nice
clean
example
of
the
style
and
it
makes
a
good
choice
for
those
who
want
a
good
introductory
vienna
lager
and
are
not
sure
where
to
start
the
taste
is
not
as
full
and
rich
as
some
of
the
best
in
its
class
but
this
is
still
a
good
example
of
this
style
and
one
worth
trying
if
you
happen
to
find
yourself
in
virginia
and
want
a
nice
fresh
unoffensive
craft
beer
to
sample
overall
its
actually
pretty
decent
but
sort
of
tuned
down
i
think
a
little
too
much
the
sweetness
comes
a
little
more
noticeable
as
it
warms
up
its
alright
clean
and
crisp
with
a
semidry
finish
medium
to
slightly
light
bodied
with
medium
carbonation
decently
refreshing
not
bad
at
all
but
also
not
particularly
exceptional
might
be
just
a
touch
too
sweet
for
my
liking
easy
drinking
extremely
balanced
for
a
maltforward
beer
very
clean
a
real
treat
to
enjoy
and
having
had
only
a
handful
of
vienna
lagers
before
this
one
really
stands
out
and
i
can
see
why
it
earned
a
gold
in
its
category
at
the
world
beer
cup
this
year
really
good
has
a
very
unique
toasty
flavor
quite
intense
maltiness
is
toned
back
allowing
the
toastiness
and
hops
to
shine
awesome
my
first
time
having
this
was
at
the
gloucester
va
brew
jam
it
was
mighty
tasty
in
the
warm
weather
i
would
definitely
session
this
beer
overall
there
is
a
reason
this
beer
took
home
gold
medal
at
the
2012
beerworldcup
its
a
fine
tasting
beer
by
any
measure
finishes
dry
moderate
carbonation
and
thin
to
medium
body
and
its
super
easy
to
drink
defiantly
would
be
a
goto
session
ale
if
i
could
buy
it
locally
ahem
d
i
actually
found
this
to
be
a
little
bit
of
a
miss
for
me
there
is
just
something
missing
in
both
the
malt
and
hop
departments
ive
had
this
on
draft
at
the
brewpub
a
few
times
and
i
remember
it
being
much
better
than
this
hmmm
not
sure
if
there
is
substantial
difference
in
the
water
between
the
brewpub
and
production
brewery
location
but
that
is
the
only
flavor
affecting
factor
i
can
think
of
o
devils
backbone
has
made
a
very
good
lager
here
the
vienna
lager
is
a
classic
example
of
the
style
and
a
very
drinkable
brew
it
may
not
be
the
best
of
the
style
that
honor
belongs
to
great
lakes
eliot
ness
but
it
is
one
of
the
better
ones
quite
sessionable
another
winner
from
virginia
easily
recommended
smell
is
of
crisp
malt
taste
is
slightly
fruity
maybe
apple
malty
but
smooth
slightly
heavy
and
thick
but
slightly
above
average
accross
the
board
ok
brew
not
worth
seeking
out
o
overall
this
is
a
pretty
tasty
vienna
lager
thats
super
drinkable
and
great
for
drinking
in
numbers
though
the
taste
is
fairly
sweet
its
not
too
overpowering
and
provides
enough
noble
hops
to
create
a
well
rounded
flavor
im
glad
this
beer
is
now
being
distributed
in
six
packs
and
look
forward
to
picking
up
some
more
in
the
future
im
very
impressed
by
this
beer
from
a
new
virginia
brewery
at
4
9
it
is
highly
sessionable
and
i
will
definitely
be
buying
multiple
6
packs
of
this
this
summer
pours
a
clear
copper
color
with
a
singlefinger
white
head
and
a
ring
or
two
of
lacing
on
the
way
down
the
nose
brings
some
slight
notes
of
bread
and
caramel
and
a
faint
hop
presence
the
flavor
is
mostly
bread
crust
and
a
touch
of
caramel
with
light
hops
toward
the
finish
providing
a
nice
bitterness
light
body
and
good
carbonation
another
winning
lager
overall
a
nice
beer
thats
easy
to
drink
and
tasty
enough
that
a
beer
love
would
appreciate
this
nazdravi
beer
is
wet
and
medium
to
light
in
body
without
being
watery
strong
malt
presence
props
this
beer
up
nicely
the
finish
isnt
dry
or
grainy
no
apparently
acidity
just
a
nice
finish
id
have
this
beer
again
drinkability
superb
sessionable
beer
as
this
went
down
quickly
and
the
alcohol
level
is
low
great
flavors
make
this
one
a
must
try
while
at
the
brewpub
d
reminds
me
of
an
octoberfest
easy
to
quaf
but
not
my
favorite
combination
of
flavors
but
im
rating
it
good
for
the
style
id
rather
have
a
good
pils
do
they
drink
a
bunch
o
similarlystyled
brews
in
good
ol
osterreich
no
matter
this
one
pours
a
clear
pale
amber
topped
by
a
finger
of
quicklydying
white
foam
the
nose
comprises
tofee
buttered
biscuits
and
a
dab
o
honey
honestly
this
is
sweeter
than
i
imagined
it
would
be
the
taste
is
not
as
sweet
holding
notes
of
light
caramel
light
honey
rye
bread
and
a
bit
o
citrus
zest
the
body
is
light
with
a
light
carbonation
and
a
decently
smooth
feel
overall
a
slightly
above
average
vienna
nicely
drinkable
but
not
much
beyond
that
poured
into
a
pint
glass
from
a
growler
malty
bready
aroma
no
hops
detected
clear
deep
copper
plenty
of
head
that
doesnt
stick
around
moderate
amount
of
lacing
slightly
sweet
with
the
bitterness
creeping
in
at
the
end
medium
to
full
mouth
feel
overall
it
is
a
very
enoyable
lager
this
is
the
one
that
stood
out
for
me
in
the
sampler
enough
to
want
to
take
home
in
a
growler
on
tap
at
brewery
a
great
session
beer
i
echo
the
other
reviews
when
i
say
this
is
one
of
the
best
vienna
style
beers
i
have
ever
tried
in
usa
deep
ruby
color
rich
mouthfeel
malty
body
i
could
drink
this
by
the
gallon
too
bad
its
only
avilbe
at
the
brewpub
or
in
to
go
growlers
this
is
my
go
to
beer
when
at
the
brewery
outside
of
some
german
offerings
this
is
hands
down
the
best
vienna
lager
i
have
had
produced
in
the
states
the
beer
is
very
well
made
and
is
consistent
every
time
i
go
here
i
would
love
seeing
this
bottled
drinkability
another
solid
beer
its
not
over
the
top
or
mindblowing
but
its
definitely
sessionable
low
in
alcohol
crisp
and
refreshing
and
a
solid
addition
to
dbs
repertoire
cant
wait
for
the
outside
seating
here
to
get
finished
this
seems
like
a
summeroutside
on
the
patio
kinda
beer
o
easily
drinkable
love
rock
marries
an
everyday
lager
thats
both
simple
at
first
glance
and
complex
with
deeper
enjoyment
this
germanstyle
lager
has
wonderful
maltiness
underscored
by
the
german
noble
hops
for
a
smooth
and
satisfying
brew
overall
this
is
good
for
a
no
frills
vienna
lager
though
nothing
too
groundbreaking
an
acceptable
poolside
beverage
gotta
love
paul
simon
gettin
stuck
in
your
head
anyway
this
stuff
pours
a
clear
brass
topped
by
over
a
finger
of
creamwhite
foam
the
nose
comprises
flowers
very
light
biscuit
and
even
lighter
somehow
orange
rind
the
taste
brings
in
more
of
the
same
along
with
a
mild
sense
of
honeylike
sweetness
that
pervades
all
aspects
of
life
the
body
is
a
light
medium
with
a
very
light
moderate
carbonation
and
a
fluid
feel
overall
an
okay
little
amber
lager
something
i
could
see
drinking
fairly
easily
but
not
something
i
would
actually
aim
to
drink
all
that
often
not
impressed
bought
this
beer
soon
after
moving
to
wisconsin
and
trying
all
the
wonderful
craft
brews
available
poured
well
enough
into
tall
glass
took
a
sip
and
then
nothing
tepid
first
couple
of
sips
followed
by
that
taste
of
phenol
that
a
lot
of
the
commercial
cheap
lagers
have
over
here
very
surprised
to
taste
such
a
limp
lager
poured
rest
down
sink
this
beer
tasted
watered
down
and
much
like
a
run
of
the
mill
cheap
commercial
lager
for
this
beer
read
miller
poured
into
a
bottle
with
a
fancy
label
to
make
it
look
appealing
overall
not
an
extremely
exciting
beer
but
very
drinkable
a
good
fullbodied
feel
with
good
carbonation
and
pretty
decent
flavor
just
nothing
that
stands
out
as
being
particularly
outstanding
not
a
bad
brew
and
i
expected
a
hoppy
blond
ale
but
to
my
surprise
this
is
a
helles
it
is
a
little
full
flavored
a
helles
for
my
taste
i
would
like
to
try
this
one
cleaner
is
this
from
the
bottle
conditioning
the
yeast
they
used
the
flaming
damsel
pours
deep
goldenlight
amber
color
it
almost
has
a
redpink
hue
to
it
with
a
thin
skim
of
white
head
the
aroma
is
moderately
maltygrainy
sweet
some
hints
of
caramel
inviting
the
flavor
mimics
the
nose
moderately
maltygrainy
a
bit
toastybready
with
just
a
bit
of
spicy
hop
flavor
the
finish
is
smooth
slightly
dry
in
part
to
a
mediumlow
hop
bitterness
carbonation
is
medium
and
body
medium
as
well
overall
a
decent
beer
yes
there
are
better
of
this
style
but
i
would
gladly
take
a
second
one
once
again
a
thanks
to
woodychandler
for
yet
another
canned
beer
for
me
to
try
poured
from
a
16
oz
can
has
a
caramel
color
with
a
12
inch
head
smell
is
dominated
by
malts
taste
also
has
considerable
malts
grains
a
touch
of
hops
are
present
feels
medium
bodied
in
the
mouth
and
overall
is
a
refreshing
and
good
beer
taste
mild
malt
small
hops
low
bitterness
but
very
balanced
pleasing
and
quaffable
but
not
for
me
its
a
nice
enough
amber
lager
blonde
lager
is
that
a
style
and
i
wish
them
well
with
it
this
is
a
clean
easydrinking
beer
that
would
pair
perfectlly
with
a
book
porch
cool
fall
day
if
i
didnt
already
have
a
couple
of
goto
summer
beers
this
one
might
get
an
extended
tryout
refrehsingly
good
brew
their
website
indicates
that
this
is
done
in
the
vienna
lager
style
and
would
be
inclined
to
agree
as
this
possessed
that
tangy
mix
of
fruit
and
bread
that
i
find
so
often
in
these
beers
this
was
decent
but
not
overly
memorable
bottle
poured
into
a
new
glarus
pint
glass
good
appearance
poured
a
cloudy
dark
caramel
ale
color
smelled
very
good
like
a
good
blonde
beer
excellent
taste
some
hops
but
understated
great
mouthfeel
super
drinkable
i
will
be
picking
up
more
of
this
next
time
i
am
in
wisconsin
following
the
crack
glug
the
pour
resulted
in
two
rocky
fingers
worth
of
ecru
head
that
burbled
and
fell
like
a
diver
entertaining
the
turn
of
the
20th
century
crowds
color
was
a
mediumamber
with
nequality
clarity
bupgoo
following
their
advice
i
put
my
face
in
the
glass
and
was
rewarded
with
a
wet
nose
confound
this
beak
of
mine
regrouping
it
was
certainly
malt
forward
but
underlain
with
the
tang
of
saaz
hops
mmm
mouthfeel
was
somewhat
thin
but
with
a
pleasant
lager
sweetness
on
the
tongue
finish
continued
to
be
malty
sweet
which
is
ok
for
the
style
but
less
to
my
liking
not
a
bad
beer
but
not
one
that
i
would
want
a
whole
bunch
of
either
nice
all
around
drinking
beer
overall
this
is
an
outstanding
lager
balanced
and
beautiful
as
somebody
who
prefers
lagers
to
have
this
brewery
dedicate
itself
to
germanic
styles
including
lagers
elevates
it
above
other
chicago
craft
breweries
i
enjoy
the
thick
slighty
chewy
malt
notes
in
here
hops
are
present
but
they
only
support
not
dominate
when
i
go
out
i
try
to
find
a
venue
that
has
this
beer
especially
on
tap
i
should
have
this
beer
more
often
overall
metropolitan
is
certainly
a
premier
brewery
if
you
are
looking
for
lagers
impressive
flavors
produced
with
that
cleanliness
i
always
look
for
in
a
lager
great
stuff
this
is
an
easy
beer
to
session
and
very
easy
to
pair
with
food
perfect
beer
to
give
someone
who
says
they
dont
like
lagers
i
dont
really
drink
a
lot
of
lagers
but
this
beer
is
fantastic
very
sessionable
but
has
a
lot
going
on
with
hops
malt
tad
sweetness
that
balances
out
the
vienna
really
shines
local
too
they
do
a
good
job
of
consistency
which
helps
i
know
i
can
always
trust
in
buying
a
solid
beer
from
these
guys
overall
pretty
typical
for
an
amber
lager
too
sweet
for
my
palate
with
minimal
bitterness
i
really
enjoyed
the
crisp
mouthfeel
however
onot
a
horrible
beer
but
not
nearly
comparable
to
a
boston
lager
or
sprecher
amber
wont
buy
again
for
all
you
extreme
ale
drinkers
out
there
me
included
this
is
a
great
lager
to
bring
you
back
to
earth
very
refreshing
and
a
reminder
of
how
interesting
a
lighter
beer
can
be
overall
this
is
one
of
the
few
lager
styles
that
americans
seem
to
do
pretty
damned
well
hoppier
versions
like
sabl
are
on
one
end
this
is
on
the
other
it
relies
on
perfect
balance
and
expert
malt
development
to
deliver
the
flavour
no
room
for
flaws
in
this
beer
and
there
really
arent
any
at
all
bottle
poured
a
clear
tarnished

with
a
small
lasting
white
head
aromas
of
honey

light
bodied
and
smooth
with
a

finish
flavors
of
honey
straw
and
light
earthiness
with
a
smooth

honey
finish
poured
a
clear
pale
golden
yellow
since
this
was
brought
out
to
me
by
a
waitress
there
was
no
noticable
head
or
lacing
left
by
the
time
it
got
to
my
table
has
a
nice
wheat
scent
mixed
with
some
floral
and
citrus
hints
has
a
slightly
dry
start
with
a
crisp
and
clean
finish
the
finishing
taste
was
a
lot
better
than
the
beginning
taste
i
had
completly
forgot
i
had
tried
this
beer
before
out
of
a
bottle
im
always
one
to
say
beer
is
better
on
tap
but
in
this
case
i
really
didnt
think
so
o
a
solid
enjoyable
beer
could
drink
several
in
one
setting
a
good
lager
overall
this
is
one
of
the
best
american
lagers
i
have
had
it
is
clean
crisp
flavorfull
and
easy
to
drink
miller
and
bud
wish
they
tasted
this
good
another
beer
im
trying
for
the
first
time
after
passing
it
by
all
the
time
at
the
store
it
pours
a
clear
light
brass
topped
by
a
finger
of
lightly
offwhite
foam
the
nose
comprises
buttery
caramel
very
light
lemon
zest
flowers
and
light
sweetgrass
the
taste
holds
notes
of
toffee
very
mild
cocoa
flowers
grass
greens
and
what
seems
like
some
toasted
malts
the
body
is
a
hefty
light
with
a
very
light
moderate
carbonation
and
a
dry
finish
overall
a
fairly
solid
vienna
though
the
nose
is
pretty
weak
and
the
flavors
just
dont
seem
to
meld
all
the
way
if
that
makes
any
sense
anymore
d
a
light
clean
userfriendly
beer
presumably
brewed
for
the
macro
crossover
drinker
a
quality
beer
that
i
found
enjoyable
though
not
overly
memorable
o
this
beer
just
about
nails
the
vienna
lager
style
in
fact
ill
probably
revisit
this
review
in
a
couple
days
after
ive
sampled
a
couple
more
because
it
could
be
just
about
perfect
but
for
the
low
aroma
characters
the
flavor
of
the
beer
is
complex
and
mellow
at
the
same
time
very
much
as
youd
expect
in
the
style
pours
a
clear
copper
color
with
enough
lacing
for
the
duration
of
this
session
toasted
bread
and
a
faintness
of
caramel
in
this
immaculate
nose
refreshing
crispness
reaches
new
levels
here
a
wonderful
mouthfeel
uniform
toastiness
on
the
dry
side
though
there
is
a
quick
touch
of
caramel
in
the
middle
hops
have
a
quick
sting
of
bitter
ness
with
some
raw
herbal
flavors
dry
toastedgrain
ending
a
solid
brew
very
easy
to
drink
with
a
smattering
of
wellplaced
complexities
to
make
it
interesting

d
easy
going
down
and
refreshing
if
this
was
meant
to
be
super
flavorful
and
complex
then
they
screwed
up
but
if
this
was
meant
to
be
a
good
thirst
quenching
beer
then
they
did
just
fine
the
drinkability
on
this
is
decent
for
me
as
i
found
the
flavor
of
this
beer
to
be
very
intriguing
and
fun
overall
likes
its
brother
krankshaft
i
would
describe
this
beer
as
clean
it
had
an
every
mans
beer
quality
or
womans
it
was
good
but
a
solid
offering
that
i
could
easily
go
back
to
again

the
infinite

i
would
like
to
buy
more
of
this
beer
and
feel
fortunuate

is
available
in
my
area
the
mouthfeel
pairs
a
light
to
medium
body
with
light
carbination
the
aftertaste
is
sweet
caramel
that
lingers
and
teases
me
to
take
another
sip
the
only
thing
is
id
love
just
a
touch
more
carbonation
this
beer
is
very
drinkable
this
is
the
second
beer
ive
had
from
metropolitan
and
theyre

this
is

a

the
finish
and
a
touch
more
hops
would
make
it
perfect
overall
i
thought
this
was
a
well
made
vienna
lager
i
hate
to
post
the
exact
same
score
as
kegatron
who
i
received
the
bottle
from
but
i
felt
exactly
the
same
way
about
this
beer
its
pretty
easy
to
drink
i
dont
taste
any
alcohol
and
the
flavor
is
easygoing
and
maltdominant
wow
another
solidly
crafted
lager
from
these
guys
with
its
well
balanced
flavors
and
smooth
body
really
helping
out
with
drinkibility
of
this
well
done
d
easy
to
drink
its
a
unique
flavor
that
makes
it
interesting
to
drink
ill
have
to
try
another
insanely
drinkable
and
enjoyable
beer
from
the
folks
at
metro
my
first
glass
was
empty
in
about
ten
minutes
deasy
drinking
yet
fullflavored
lager
that
i
could
see
being
a
summer
staple
thanks
again
frank
for
giving
me
the
chance
to
try
these
two
metropolitan
beers
drinkability
kick
up
the
bbq
grill
throw
on
the
brats
break
out
this
beer
a
nice
drinker
wish
it
was
available
in
sc
color
is
a
light
caramel
amber
a
finger
of
foam
rises
and
fades
leaving
a
ring
and
skim
across
the
top
lightly
sweet
and
bready
with
a
mild
hint
of
fruitiness
toasty
grain
an
apricot
hints
very
smooth
and
malty
some
honey
and
bread
in
the
aftertaste
easy
to
drink
and
not
overly
sweet
versatile
with
food
a
sixer
always
disappears
too
fast
always
a
solid
option
on
tap
around
chicago
also
the
body
is
light
to
medium
with
plenty
of
carbonation
to
keep
it
lively
i
could
drink
lots
of
these
d
this
beer
has
a
great
freshness
and
a
nice
depth
while
still
remains
a
smooth
rich
lager
it
has
just
enough
sweetness
and
dryness
to
really
make
it
fresh
and
give
it
a
good
depth
great
for
a
session
brew
aswell
not
a
standout
but
a
good
solid
beer
pretty
true
to
style
i
believe
thanks
to
pudge43
for
this
one
drinkability
sessionable
this
might
just
be
my
alltime
favorite
beer
i
normally
tend
to
favor
ales
over
lagers
but
something
about
the
dynamo
commands
my
respect
no
my
reverence
i
happened
across
this
gem
in
a
biker
bar
in
chicago
and
fell
instantly
in
love
with
it
it
is
perfectly
balanced
and
quite
flavorful
it
feels
so
smooth
and
tangy
which
i
realize
are
conflicting
adjectives
and
yet
the
dynamo
can
pull
it
off
if
this
beer
were
a
country
i
would
go
to
war
and
die
for
it
if
this
beer
were
a
band
i
would
be
its
roadie
groupie
and
number
one
fan
as
it
is
with
all
beers
there
is
something
in
the
body
that
is
lost
in
translation
from
tap
to
bottle
but
the
dynamo
still
tastes
and
feels
great
regardless
of
the
medium
by
which
it
is
consumed
i
only
wish
i
could
replace
my
blood
with
it
i
will
abide
d
i
have
to
say
i
really
like
what
metropolitan
has
done
here
i
find
myself
liking
this
beer
more
with
every
sip
i
would
gladly
have
another
or
several
more
overall
impression
just
a
bit
too
sweet
but
not
a
bad
basic
session
beer
mediumlight
body
with
a
good
amount
of
carbonation
i
found
this
beer
to
be
fairly
tasty
but
too
sweet
overall
almost
as
if
it
were
under
attenuated
overall
its
solid
but
not
great
was
excited
to
just
stumble
onto
this
on
tap
but
felt
a
little
let
down
clear
amber
with
a
nice
creamy
head
lightish
nose
is
caramelly
bready
with
grassy
spicy
hops
underneath
taste
follows
suit
with
the
lightly
sweet
malts
gently
washed
out
by
the
supporting
smooth
hop
bitterness
nice
frothy
carbonation
helps
with
mouthfeel
and
drinkability
lightbodied
and
sessionable
very
happy
that
one
of
the
biggest
cities
in
the
us
is
finally
on
the
map
for
beer
i
just
dont
liike
the
fact
that
each
brewery
has
to
find
a
niche
to
become
palatable
to
the
general
public
in
this
city
but
i
suppose
they
are
just
starting
out
look
forward
to
some
different
styles
i
really
respect
the
fact
that
they
are
going
through
the
act
of
making
a
beer
that
is
accessible
to
the
public
that
isnt
easier
to
produce
whereas
most
are
craft
beer
typical
that
steers
away
from
drinkable
and
are
more
preoccupied
with
making
the
ultimate
hop
geared
beer
i
look
forward
to
their
ventures
from
tasting
notes
on
25
jun
2009
d
decent
enough
flavor
and
goes
down
easy
makes
this
a
solid
drinkable
beer
just
nothing
that
really
sticks
out
and
makes
this
stand
out
i
poured
this
copper
colored
lager
into
a
pint
glass
there
was
a
medium
head
with
a
little
bit
of
lacing
the
nose
is
mostly
caramel
with
a
little
bit
of
nuttiness
the
taste
is
refreshing
not
too
sweet
well
balanced
mouthfeel
is
fairly
viscus
for
a
lager
pretty
smooth
i
could
drink
quite
a
few
of
these
in
a
sitting
seems
like
a
good
shoulder
season
drinker
i
think
this
a
good
example
of
a
style
rarely
brewed
by
american
craft
brewers
that
said
i
dont
know
if
i
would
pay
10
for
a
six
pack
of
this
too
often
d
good
i
like
flywheel
better
but
its
nice
to
see
a
brewery
focus
on
lagers
not
something
you
see
much
of
these
days
especially
in
american
brews
d
i
like
ales
better
than
lagers
so
for
me
this
was
a
great
lager
because
it
didnt
meet
the
style
guidelines
very
well
all
that
aside
it
was
easy
drinking
and
sessionable
and
tasted
good
enough
to
want
more
than
one
ring
of
foam
atop
a
hazey
rust
and
copper
colored
amber
brew
faint
spicey
hops
mix
with
toasted
malts
that
give
gariny
carameled
bread
aromas
toasty
vibrant
malts
dance
on
the
tip
of
the
tongue
dry
as
well
as
sweet
malt
flavors
balanced
with
hallertau
hops
and
their
touch
of
spice
dry
ad
malty
palates
make
for
a
flavorful
session
lager
mouthfeel
is
light
bodied
and
smooth
with
good
carbonation
if
you
want
to
taste
what
i
image
most
lagers
should
taste
like
try
this
beer
even
though
i
am
not
a
fan
of
lagers
in
general
i
would
get
dynamo
again
whoa
a
massive
amount
of
foam
about
half
a
halfliter
mug
with
this
one
pours
a
brilliant
copper
almost
red
color
the
foam
settles
leaving
behind
little
sticky
bits
on
the
sides
of
the
glass
its
difficult
for
me
to
pin
down
what
this
beer
smells
like
fresh
grain
is
sort
of
buried
under
another
aroma
perhaps
toasted
marshmallow
its
not
huge
but
i
think
its
there
this
one
drinks
like
a
marzen
its
all
about
caramel
and
toasted
malt
that
almost
gets
a
bit
tawny
in
the
finish
which
has
probably
just
the
right
amount
of
hearty
malt
and
bitter
hops
in
the
finish
quite
tasty
fresh
and
ridiculously
drinkable
this
lager
goes
beyond
mass
market
lagers
in
that
it
has
actual
good
flavor
characterized
by
actual
malt
and
real
hoppiness
its
higher
in
alcohol
than
most
lagers
and
thats
good
other
than
that
its
not
really
a
big
beer
d
in
a
style
that
is
quite
drinkable
although
not
the
best
tasting
variety
that
ive
had
its
nice
to
support
a
local
upandcomer
and
i
really
like
the
idea
of
the
lageronly
brewery
so
ill
probably
go
with
this
one
from
time
to
time
d
nice
to
see
another
chicago
brewery
with
bottles
on
the
shelves
but
this
one
isnt
anything
spectacular
nothing
really
special
about
this
beer
drinks
like
an
immature
lager
i
think
it
may
be
a
bit
misnamed
thought
it
would
have
a
bit
more
color
for
a
copper
lager
it
drinks
easy
and
pours
with
a
nice
head
and
lacing
simply
an
average
beer
both
inn
mouth
feel
and
drinkability
there
are
so
many
other
better
beers
available
to
drink
rjt
o
way

medium
to

a
thick
film
of

with
good
retention
and

lacing
aroma
of
sweet
bready
and
caramel

flavor
starts
with
caramel
malt
with
hints
of
toasted
malt
slight
brown
sugar
finshes
a
bit
thin
with
a
faint
reminder
of
the
sweet
malt
medium
bodied
with
a
peppery
almost
overactive
carbonation
starts
off
pretty
well
if
a
bit
mild
but
the
flavor
tapers
off
fairly
quickly
at
the
same
time
that
the
active
carbonation
becomes
a
distraction
pleasant
enough
to
drink
with
lunch
but
fairly
unbalanced
and
light
tasting
in
the
finish
o
suggests
an
odd
cross
between
a
light
euro
pale
and
a
mexican
amber
ok
but
not
worth
seeking

first
review
novice
who
just
discovered
real
beer
tasting
at
40
o
the
taste
of
this
beer
might
seem
to
be
a
little
bland
but
it
is
still
easy
to
drink
some
hints
of
hop
flavors
might
have
made
it
a
little
more
interesting
overall
nothing
special
but
fairly
easy
to
drink
forgettable
but
still
enjoyable
easy
to
drink
enjoyable
in
a
blind
taaste
test
i
would
have
guessed
an
austrian
märzen
overall
great
wines
come
from
italy
but
they
might
want
to
focus
on
their
beers
in
their
future
might
have
to
stick
to
morrettis
this
one
reminds
me
of
european
lagers
i
have
had
over
the
years
pours
a
nice
clear
darkish
amber
with
a
fairly
thick
ivorytan
head
aroma
is
crisp
more
fruity
than
malty
not
strong
but
still
appealing
malty
flavor
is
crisp
and
a
little
fruity
nothing
special
but
enjoyable
this
makes
a
good
accompaniment
to
a
meal
rather
than
a
standalone
drink
texture
has
average
body
and
a
decent
amount
of
fizz
overall
fair
to
middlin
and
worth
at
least
a
try
overall
not
a
bad
brew
but
not
very
interesting
either
its
aight
o
drinkable
and
enjoyable
style
over
substance
as
it
looks
better
than
it
tastes
still
i
would
have
again
this
beer
really
reminds
me
of
a
slightly
stronger
yuengling
which
isnt
saying
much
overall
you
could
do
worse
but
i
would
have
to
say
i
wouldnt
want
to
have
this
again
really
if
i
had
a
choice
drinkability
without
having
heard
of
this
beer
or
brewery
the
waiter
at
the
italian
restaurant
i
was
at
said
this
was
an
italian
microbrew
and
was
much
better
than
the
rest
of
italys
offerings
he
showed
me
the
interesting
bottle
and
i
decided
to
make
the
plunge
menabrea
will
not
be
getting
any
more
of
my
money
especially
at
import
prices
i
would
love
to
have
a
good
italian
beer
that
would
hold
up
to
my
italian
meal
but
this
just
simply
does
not
do
it
libation
on
the
plus
side
this
is
a
very
well
balanced
lively
beverage
with
some
minor
complexity
an
the
negative
side
it
brings
nothing
to
the
table
in
any
of
those
areas
that
makes
me
want
to
try
it
again
its
a
mediocre
beer
but
add
to
that
the
2
49
price
tag
for
one
bottle
and
this
is
too
high
a
price
for
too
low
a
value
d
experience
wouldnt
have
been
so
bad
if
not
for
the
horrible
aftertaste
also
carbonation
was
almost
too
filling
to
even
stomach
one
bottle
drinkability
is
fair
the
smell
is
good
but
the
beer
goes
downhill
from
there
mouthfeel
is
definitely
the
worst
aspect
and
it
detracts
from
the
drinkability
d
body
is
medium
to
low
which
would
have
allowed
a
moderate
session
but
the
poor
characteristics
blew
the
deal
on
this
one
d
a
lager
i
kind
of
wanted
to
like
but
it
is
not
one
i
would
recommend
at
all
obviously
i
found
this
one
just
was
not
good
to
begin
with
and
left
a
not
good
taste
in
my
mouth
id
consider
this
a
below
average
amber
lager
but
as
a
vienna
lager
it
fails
in
maltiness
breadiness
richness
and
depth
no
where
near
the
intended
flavor
descriptions
why
is
italian
beer
so
damned
expensive
it
isnt
like
theyre
in
anyones
top10
brewing
nations
of
the
world
ive
seen
750s
for
1522
and
even
higher
that
arent
that
highly
regarded
this
single
cost
2
49
which
probably
translates
to
a
sixpack
price
well
over
10
bottom
line
this
is
lousy
beer
at
any
price
drinkable
sweet
brew
overall
not
much
to
say
dont
think
the
long
voyage
did
this
beer
any
favors
would
not
get
this
again
you
can
drink
this
one
very
easily
and
i
might
say
its
not
bad
afterall
much
much
better
than
the
lager
version
of
menabrea
the
beer
pours
a
clear
copper
color
with
a
little
dish
water
head
the
detected
aroma
is
exclusively
from
the
toasted
malts
light
to
medium
bodied
on
the
palate
the
flavor
is
grainy
husky
bready
a
little
caramel
sweetness
this
is
all
balanced
with
some
spice
in
the
finish
drinkable
and
pleasant
not
to
bad
pours
a
four
finger
cream
head
that
fades
quickly
to
a
thin
layer
leaving
some
lace
clear
amber
color
good
carbonation
and
lightmedium
bodied
malty
nose
flavor
is
sweetish
caramel
dont
get
the
metallic
that
some
raters
have
noted
1
99
for
a
330ml
bottle
from
manchester
wine
and
liquors
manchester
ct
overall
below
average
too
metallic
slightly
salty
and
blandish
for
me
not
a
fan
of
overall
character
or
almost
general
lack
thereof
aftertaste
not
too
thrilling
either
not
horrible
has
something
of
a
standard
viennaamber
lager
character
to
it
but
i
certainly
wouldnt
get
it
again
pours
a
bright
burnt
orange
with
a
tall
tan
head
that
retains
exceptionally
well
leaving
lots
of
sticky
sheets
of
lacing
as
it
falls
to
a
quarter
inch
cap
that
holds
the
duration
the
nose
is
mildly
sweet
with
some
nuttieness
as
well
malts
up
front
are
sweet
a
caramely
with
toasted
bread
notes
along
with
hints
of
roasted
sesame
seeds
and
gentleearthyspicy
hops
the
body
is
solid
in
every
manor
of
the
word
with
a
nice
dryness
factor
and
an
aftertaste
that
works
as
a
constant
calling
card
for
another
sip
keep
brewing
this
shit
peoplethis
is
a
fine
amber
overall
a
pretty
good
amber
ale
shame
its
retired
as
could
happily
drink
a
few
more
of
these
sampled

pours
a
clear

brown
with
a
big
off
white
head
a
slight
sweet
hoppy
nose
with
a
nutty
edge
metallic
with
a
slight
nutty
flavor
theres
potential
but
it
doesnt
really
come
through
though
the
nut
character
is
nice
it
is
drinkable
sure
but
for
an
anniversary
edition
brew
i
am
not
blown
away
pours
medium
amber
with
a
nice
head
that
lingers
well
leaving

aroma
is
pretty
strong
malt
and

somewhat
reminiscent
of
a

pretty
fresh
for
a
retired

again
sweet
honeymalt
characters
up

but
not
as
strong
as
the
aroma
hops
in
the
background
faint
but
noticeable
much
better
than
the
original
menabrea
and
something
i
will
look
for
next
time
i
am
in
italy
as
long
as
i
am
somewhere
with
other
choices
i
will
probably
not
seek
this
one
out
anyway
on
to
the
review
this
was
quite
a
weird
beer
for
me
opened
and
poured
into
chimay
glass
an
almost
overwhelming
aroma
of
molasses
hit
me
this
thick
maltiness
made
me
worry
about
what
the
taste
was
going
to
be
like
the
appearence
was
a
clear
dark
amber
colour
with
a
thin
head
thankfully
it
does
not
taste
like
it
smells
it
had
a
much
more
subdued
malty
taste
with
some
sweetness
and
very
little
complexity
i
tired
of
the
taste
quite
quickly
its
not
a
beer
i
would
be
rushing
out
to
buy
again
appearance
is
a
nice
amber
with
a
thick
crisp
head
leaving
a
nice
lace
aroma
is
mainly
sweet
like
honey
blending
nicely
with
the
hops
taste
is
not
as
sweet
as
the
smell
bready
light
malt
and
hop
mouthfeel
is
light
medium
but
maybe
a
bit
thin
carbonation
is
good
giving
it
a
crisp
finish
towards
the
end
of
the
glass
i
think
my
buds
got
tuned
to
beer
wish
i
had
another
to
confirm
that
mouthfeel
drinkability
the
beer
is
approacing
medium
bodied
the
beer
is
well
carbonated
there
are
no
off
smells
or
flavors
present
in
the
beer
this
is
a
very
easy
to
drink
beer
this
beer
went
over
very
well
with
my
macro
drinking
friends
overall
its
a
pretty
decent
beer
similar
to
a
viennastyle
lager
i
actually
though
of
dos
equis
when
i
first
tasted
it
its
not
great
but
its
certainly
not
bad

i
dig
this

in

many

more
of

that
is

this
please
oi
dont
know
what
it
is
with
sun
king
and
their
lagers
but
they
are
really
good
this
and
the
oktoberfest
i
was
worried
about
both
greatly
exceed
my
expectations
a

thin

dark
golden

not
cloudy
at
allvery
solid
decent
aroma
nothing
potent
it
is
a
little
lacking
in
the
taste
but
makes
up
for
it
with
a
solid
showing
in
the
mouthfeel
department
not
bad
but
not
great
pretty
drinkable
pretty
decent
good
local
indianapolis
beer
to
support
the
mouthfeel
is
excellent
by
far
the
best
aspect
of
the
beer
its
almost
medium
in
body
with
perfect
carbonation
the
result
is
a
smooth
hearty
satisfying
feel
overall
a
decent
beer
but
not
one
of
sun
kings
best
i
fully
intend
to
buy
this
many
times
at
ballpark
prices
this
summer
but
wont
be
picking
up
any
more

both
refreshing
and
flavorful
this
is
a
nice
representation
of
the
style
i
like
it
it
would
seem
that
this
brand
has
gone
through
at
least
2
contract
brewers
so
that
would
put
them
in
their
terrible
twos
which
is
an
apt
metaphor
for
minhas
at
least
the
wisconsin
set
at
the
present
time
heres
hoping
that
this
marketing
company
comes
to
their
senses
the
next
time
around
for
their
sake
fat
cat
pours
out
a
hazy
burnt
orange
color
with
a
head
that
retains
very
well
the
aroma
is
deep
and
malty
with
a
touch
of
macroesque
twang
that
honestly
doesnt
work
too
bad
the
taste
offers
a
welldeveloped
caramel
malt
without
much
else
to
hang
out
that
said
its
tasty
but
lacking
in
any
depth
whatsoever
the
mouthfeel
is
light
for
sure
but
has
a
little
heft
and
smoothness
to
help
the
malts
along
the
drinkability
is
good
overall
fat
cat
is
a
solid
malty
lager
this
is
by
far
the
most
refreshing
tasty
mouthful
of
deliciousness
i
have
ever
experienced
in
a
session
beer
i
recommend
that
anyone
who
gets
the
chance
to
taste
this
beer
do
it
it
is
amazing
with
a
malty
toasted
arome
and
slightly
bitter
crisp
taste
and
a
dry
finish
i
wish
it
was
available
in
san
diego
although
i
hear
it
is
coming
soon
way
too
sweet
for
me
but
light
enough
to
make
it
drinkable
on
a
hot
day
its
like
good
cheap
diner
food
but
in
beer
format
it
doesnt
really
conform
to
any
style
per
se
but
say
yes
to
the
wiley
pieeyed
cat
it
far
surpasses
any
of
the
american
pißwassers
and
even
some
of
the
pbrs
naty
bohs
rolling
rocks
and
yuenglings
for
comparable
or
lesser
price
for
a
moderately
price
novelty
i
saw
on
a
shelf
and
kind
of
laughingly
purchased
i
was
kind
of
surprised
i
had
this
one
at
a
small
dive
bar
on
tap
for
a
buck
a
pour
1
pint
its
great
beer
for
a
great
price
the
initial
look
of
it
is
light
golden
had
a
great
head
that
lasted
for
a
good
amount
of
time
smell
of
a
bit
of
corn
kind
of
like
a
pabst
its
mainly
a
basic
lager
mouth
feel
but
its
good
for
after
the
expensive
beer
the
taste
was
nice
crisp
clean
and
down
to
the
point
worth
it
beer
is
medium
to
light
in
body
and
sweet
with
a
heavy
finish
not
very
good
but
not
too
horrid
i
dont
think
id
ever
have
it
again
but
it
is
a
new
brewery
and
worth
a
look
mildly
corn
grain
finish
on
the
backend
o
this
is
a
pretty
decent
brew
and
highly
drinkable
i
could
have
a
few
of
these
on
a
hot
summer
day
absolutely
worth
a
try
nothing
overly
exciting
nothing
really
offputting
just
a
very
straightforward
beer
company
beer
clever
marketing
and
a
cat
on
the
can
and
voila
perhaps
people
will
buy
it
not
half
bad
the
real
factor
will
be
pricing
the
value
is
there
but
only
to
a
certain
level
with
many
other
craft
lagers
in
the
market
the
legendary
woodychandler
comes
through
again
with
another
canned
beer
poured
from
a
12
oz
can
has
a
caramel
color
with
orange
hues
and
a
1
inch
head
smell
is
big
on
malts
biscuts
a
touch
of
sweetness
taste
is
also
very
malty
some
biscuts
and
hops
more
subdued
than
the
smell
feels
medium
bodied
in
the
mouth
and
overall
is
a
quality
brew
this
is
a
nice
ambervienna
lager
and
nothing
like
its
packaging
and
price
range
less
than
9
for
a
twelve
pack
would
suggest
it
is
brewed
and
canned
in
monroe
wisconsin
so
apparently
contract
brewed
by
minhas
for
an
orange
can
with
a
silly
slogan
it
is
actually
good
taste
and
overall
mouthfeel
amber
in
color
this
beer
is
perfect
for
quenching
your
thirst
on
a
warm
summer
day
it
the
end
its
nothing
spectacular
but
it
is
a
definitely
a
plain
ol
good
beer
o
this
is
a
shockingly
good
beer
albeit
subtle
it
compares
very
favorably
to
sa
boston
lager
side
note
the
fat
cat
i
had
was
labeled
as
brewed
by
md
ii
in
madison
wisconsin
not
san
diego
california
as
the
listing
says
d
3
5
i
could
easily
put
down
a
few
of
these
though
i
probably
wouldnt
want
more
than
a
couple
it
is
unique
for
what
ive
tried
i
find
it
a
little
offbalanced
on
the
malt
side
but
there
are
some
other
notes
coming
through
not
my
favorite
combination
of
flavors
but
decent
for
5
9912pack
i
cant
complain
better
than
the
average
massproduced
domestic
anyway
eh
perhaps
a
lawnmowing
beer
but
it
doesnt
finish
crisp
enough
d
nothing
wrong
with
the
beer
clean
finish
and
the
fact
that
it
comes
in
a
can
mean
that
i
can
probably
drink
several
the
flavor
is
a
bit
heartier
than
your
typical
adjunct
lager
but
it
is
much
lighter
than
a
malt
liquor
it
is
like
a
bastard
melding
of
the
two
i
wouldnt
go
so
far
as
to
say
it
is
a
vienna
lager
maybe
it
is
brewed
with
vienna
malt
but
i
cant
really
taste
it
d
decent
but
not
great
i
could
see
this
being
a
pretty
good
choice
for
a
hot
summer
bbq
but
then
again
there
are
a
lot
of
canned
beers
out
there
that
are
way
better
average
all
around
this
is
the
definition
of
a
hipster
beer
the
same
people
who
drink
this
stuff
are
the
same
people
who
ironically
drink
pbr
pretending
its
cool
which
it
is
not
this
beer
is
exactly
what
you
would
think
it
is
and
has
no
distinguishing
features
other
than
the
cute
can
overall
the
body
of
the
beer
is
thin
and
the
finish
is
medium
thin
this
beer
is
not
at
all
good
the
nose
gives
an
english
barleywine
aroma
and
the
taste
is
just
a
cross
between
an
american
adjunct
lager
and
a
red
ale
that
is
sweet
and
under
hopped
the
crack
glug
produced
a
little
better
than
a
finger
of
ecru
head
with
better
retention
than
the
bros
experienced
note
please
see
me
if
you
would
like
to
see
the
glug
pour
performed
before
your
very
eyes
it
can
be
done
in
the
privacy
of
your
own
home
or
onstage
as
audience
size
may
dictate
color
was
a
slightly
hazy
orangishamber
hence
the
cans
color
i
really
dig
truth
in
advertising
nose
was
very
maltysweet
with
a
hint
of
hops
underlying
the
sweetness
mouthfeel
was
medium
with
a
really
honeylike
lager
sweetness
on
the
tongue
i
may
be
jaded
following
so
many
clinkers
out
of
a
can
but
this
was
both
pleasant
and
enjoyable
this
was
unencumbered
lager
plain
and
simple
finish
was
unobtrusive
slightly
sweet
but
not
sugary
and
unquestionably
lager
i
really
liked
this
and
would
certainly
put
it
in
my
infamous
beach
cooler
where
can
i
get
some
more
sometimes
beer
is
just
beer
perhaps
this
is
not
the
poster
beer
for
vienna
lagers
but
it
does
quench
the
thirst
aside
from
the
poor
head
retention
this
is
your
basic
quaffable
amber
lager
pours
a
rather
dirty
orangeygolden
like
hue
with
huge
tan
head
nose
was
a
little
bready
on
the
palate
it
was
light
bodied
watery
even
with
mellow
malt
flavors
and
a
bit
of
melon
fruit
a
peep
of
hop
bitterness
hits
towards
the
end
and
into
the
finish
drinks
easy
but
only
because
flavors
are
so
muted
and
body
is
so
light
packaged
10085
brewed
in
monroe
d
honestly
this
beer
shocked
me
my
brotherinlaw
had
one
sitting
around
and
i
had
really
low
expectations
for
it
however
it
was
surprisingly
tasty
final
notes
i
actually
for
some
reason
really
like
this
beer
an
ideal
beer
to
take
with
you
to
the
beach
or
tailgating
when
you
cant
carry
glassware
and
just
want
to
drink
straight
from
a
can
your
lesserbeer
drinking
buddies
will
also
appreciate
it
i
think
it
has
been
a
while
since
i
last
found
this
beer
but
i
do
remember
it
being
a
not
so
good
experience
i
found
this
beer
once
at
a
local
sams
club
and
have
not
seen
it
sinceand
i
am
not
sad
about
it
the
can
is
eye
catching
and
looks
like
an
old
cartoon
series
the
smell
was
average
i
remember
the
taste
was
that
of
a
cheap
domestic
beer
with
a
taste
of
aluminum
most
beers
are
worthy
of
trying
at
least
once
but
you
may
want
to
purchase
only
1
not
an
entire
case
d
very
high
ill
be
enjoying
these
all
summer
what
a
great
cheap
beer
this
one
is
a
staple
in
my
house
which
is
a
good
thing
for
the
style
and
price
this
beer
goes
great
on
a
summer
afternoon
nice
orange
copper
pour
but
no
head
to
speak
of
after
a
real
short
time
aroma
is
of
a
typical
vienna
lager
malt
taste
is
much
of
the
same
mostly
base
malt
with
a
touch
of
specialty
caramel
malts
and
possibly
even
a
tinge
of
rye
probably
not
some
hops
just
to
balance
it
out
this
is
a
very
drinkable
beer
as
are
most
in
this
style
but
what
i
like
is
that
at
6
4912
pack
i
get
no
hints
of
crappy
additives
in
this
beer
their
may
be
a
touch
of
corn
but
it
tastes
pretty
good
sweet
can
design
many
thanks
to
kenneth
g
for
graciously
sharing
this
beer
originally
reviewed
on
march
16
2006
poured
from
a
can
pours
an
orange
copper
with
a
fast
fading
white
head
aroma
of
dusty
malt
and
light
sweetness
flavor
is
similiar
with
a
markedly
surprising
sweetness
and
caramel
quality
for
the
style
at
least
palate
is
watery
but
drinkable
as
i
commented
to
the
purveyor
for
a
pale
lager
in
a
can
from
wisconsin
its
not
bad
a
try
man
oh
man
this
is
easily
the
most
foul
tasting
beer
ive
ever
come
across
lick
your
hands
after
doing
some
engine
work
and
thats
what
this
tastes
like
cool
can
decent
pour
but
everything
else
is
the
very
worst
i
still
like
the
can
design
although
itd
be
nice
if
they
had
a
good
beer
inside
this
beer
may
be
the
only
beer
with
orange
food
coloring
added
to
it
the
body
is
bright
orange
head
is
small
and
off
white
smells
like
sweet
and
sour
sauce
really
a
funny
egg
smell
to
it
taste
is
rather
thin
and
one
note
malt
and
slightly
sweet
with
barely
perceptable
hops
in
the
background
not
very
good
this
is
cheap
beer
that
makes
an
attempt
at
something
other
than
the
classic
cheap
macro
flavor
which
is
admirable
this
is
not
bad
for
a
cheap
macrostyle
lager
the
flavor
characteristics
are
more
positive
than
not
darker
than
i
expected
fully
reddish
copper
with
a
watery
18
of
an
inch
head
that
hangs
for
about
40
seconds
commalike
lace
lightly
butterscotch
malt
aroma
flavor
goes
the
opposite
direction
slightly
astringent
with
lemon
life
saver
candy
elements
flattens
and
bottoms
out
at
the
close
with
just
a
touch
of
bittering
a
little
south
of
par
in
comparison
to
regional
macros
but
the
appearance
was
much
more
impressive
than
it
could
have
been
well
i
wasnt
really
expecting
much
with
this
beer
and
actually
i
was
pleasantly
surprised
i
found
out
about
this
beer
on
this
site
and
i
always
kept
an
eye
out
for
it
i
finally
found
it
being
sold
in
single
cans
i
figure
since
mn
brewing
is
bankrupt
they
are
just
trying
to
get
rid
of
it
i
does
have
a
nice
deep
orange
color
to
it
and
a
surprising
foamyness
that
sticks
in
white
lace
taste
is
mostly
malt
with
a
slight
hop
bitterness
id
take
this
over
most
american
style
lagers
esp
the
macros
while
it
is
enjoyable
i
dont
know
if
it
is
a
drink
all
day
kind
of
beer
ill
test
that
out
on
my
labor
day
weekend
fishing
trip
i
was
looking
for
another
decent
beer
in
cans
no
bottles
allowed
lightly
hazy
deep
golden
color
with
a
minimal
head
earthy
bready
pilsner
with
hints
of
fruit
an
floral
spicy
hops
nice
brew
that
i
returned
to
a
couple
of
times
but
to
be
world
glass
it
needs
to
clean
up
some
rough
edges
another
good
clean
simple
and
authentic
lager
from
trapp
othis
was
a
pretty
tasty
lager
very
drinkable
overall
a
tasty
malt
forward
lager
tap
poured
a
light
clear
amber
color
lager
with
a
small
foamy
head
with
good
retention
and
some
light
lacing
aroma
of
light
cereal
notes
with
light
caramelized
malt
notes
taste
is
a
mix
of
light
mediumsweet
caramel
malt
with
some
cereal
and
grainy
notes
body
is
light
with
good
carbonation
nothing
earth
shattering
here
but
well
balanced
and
easily
drinkable
growler
from
the
brewery

hazygolden
with
shortlived
white

nose
is
of
noble

and
bready

body
is

crisp
taste
is

biscuit

cooked
vegetables
and
yeast
finish
is
long
and
clean
nothing
special
is
going
on
here
but
it
is
still
crisp
refreshing
brew
this
beer
was
decanted
from
a
pitcher
and
had
no
head
in
my
glass
medium
copper
color
with
good
clarity
aroma
is
lightly
fruity
with
noticeable
but
not
excessive
diacetyl
very
nice
flavor
coming
from
bready
malts
with
a
creamy
chewy
mouthfeel
medium
carbonation
overall
a
real
satisfying
vienna
lager
i
suspect
this
is
the
last
one
of
these
ill
have
for
a
while
the
trapp
beers
come
in
quart
whoops
liter
flippies
which
is
a
format
homebrewers
like
the
vienna
is
a
toasted
hazy
gold
in
the
glass
and
the
head
was
pretty
sturdy
initial
smells
seem
subtle
but
inviting
and
get
better
its
that
first
wonderful
soft
so
balanced
lager
taste
that
wins
every
time
for
this
beer
and
its
brewery
an
absolute
olympic
gold
medal
winner
got
this
while
on
vacation
in
stowe
was
looking
forward
to
this
brew
a
little
disappointed
the
appearance
was
light
copper
in
color
it
had
a
decent
smell
thought
it
might
have
been
a
little
more
malty
though
its
taste
was
average
at
best
nothing
spectacular
overall
a
good
beer
but
again
i
was
looking
for
something
a
little
more
special
i
will
have
to
try
a
different
brew
next
time
i
am
definately
not
giving
up
on
this
brewery
yet
overall
this
is
a
very
solid
lager
and
true
to
the
style
i
also
enjoyed
their
dunkel
lager
on
tap
which
was
just
as
enjoyable
the
vienna
lager
is
an
often
overlooked
beer
style
but
this
example
was
quite
noteworthy
well
balanced
and
quite
flavorful
this
could
be
quite
sessionable
drink
a
pretty
bang
on
example
of
the
style
the
flavour
is
very
well
balanced
and
it
would
work
well
as
a
session
beer
1321
poured
clear
with
a
good
frothy
head
good
retention
smell
is
sweet
malt
with
a
very
faint
caramelcotton
candy
aroma
taste
is
moderately
sweet
malt
commanding
but
not
cloying
there
is
a
faint
burnt
caramel
edge
that
doesnt
quite
fit
in
and
this
affects
the
otherwise
near
perfect
mouthfeel
very
drinkable
would
be
an
a
if
the
malt
was
a
little
smoother
drinkability
is
where
this
beer
really
shines
it
is
crisp
and
clear
and
provides
a
mouthfull
of
taste
mouthfeel
is
light
to
medium
bodied
with
medium
carbonation
a
great
lager
very
smooth
and
drinkable
very
clean
just
fantastic
stuff
drinkability
is
good
nice
balance
crisp
and
refreshing
a
tasty
lager
while
i
found
this
on
tap
at
american
flatbread
i
would
definitely
visit
the
actual
brewery
very
well
done
and
i
think
this
is
the
brewers
allen
van
anda
true
calling
you
can
find
the
helles
lager
at
the
farmhouse
tap
and
brewery
as
well
i
didnt
get
a
chance
to
sample
it
there
taste
is
very
rich
and
malty
and
super
drinkable
theres
a
very
light
hoppiness
and
smooth
crisp
finish
really
this
is
an
xcelle
t
xample
of
the
style
a
bit
less
toasty
than
id
like
but
very
good
overall
this
is
a
delicious
beer
that
is
built
to
be
paired
with
food
of
all
types
i
recommend
using
it
to
wash
down
a
hearty
blackbean
burrito
with
spicy
salsa
and
rich
guacamole
solid
but
taste
like
a
west
coast
hoppy
lager
not
much
danish
about
it
quality
lager
here
and
the
vienna
style
never
really
does
much
for
me
but
this
one
never
gets
sweet
and
relies
more
on
a
special
red
type
malt
than
the
same
generic
medium
crystal
we
always
see
and
the
yeast
character
adds
a
lot
to
a
beer
that
usually
has
very
little
of
it
frothy
looking
light
amber
brew
to
call
it
red
is
a
stretch
but
it
has
great
clarity
and
it
holds
its
head
the
nose
on
it
s
really
muted
almost
stale
and
with
a
wet
cardboard
thing
it
doesnt
smell
real
nice
at
all
honestly
but
the
taste
is
lovely
dry
but
still
malty
is
hard
to
do
refreshing
in
the
finish
with
a
light
dried
fruit
character
and
the
lager
yeast
hops
arent
robust
but
the
beer
is
well
balanced
light
enough
to
drink
a
ton
of
good
in
all
seasons
and
finally
an
example
of
a
vienna
lager
that
i
would
buy
again
flavor
is
clean
and
also
pleasantly
malty
bready
with
a
light
plum
ester
dry
finish
with
trace
hop
bitterness
light
and
medium
bodied
with
very
little
sweetness
if
at
all
pairs
well
with
food
thanks
to
wst
for
this
one
first
time
i
had
this
beer
was
in
a
bomber
that
i
overpaid
for
drank
it
alone
and
was
not
super
impressed
tried
it
again
tonight
this
time
in
a
12
oz
bottle
with
food
and
found
it
quite
enjoyable
and
definitely
superior
to
something
like
sam
adams
boston
lager
this
is
a
smooth
and
easy
drinking
vienna
style
lager
i
will
drink
it
again
was
hoping
for
a
bit
more
but
i
wasnt
terribly
happy
about
this
beer
definitely
decent
for
the
style
but
thats
it
i
love
how
they
just
throw
it
out
there

decent
has
this
great
mineral
quality
in
the
body
of
the
beer
this
poured
a
coppery
liquid
with
an
inch
head
that
flattens
pretty
quickly
there
is
a
citrus
nose
with
maybe
a
bit
of
whisky
barrel
in
the
background
its
very
subtle
and
hard
to
pick
out
the
flavour
has
a
bit
grain
with
slight
fruit
in
the
finish
maybe
apricot
like
the
nose
the
whisky
barrel
is
very
subtle
i
took
a
big
swig
and
held
it
in
my
mouth
the
carbonation
was
active
the
whole
time
o
dont
get
me
wrong
this
is
a
pleasant
beer
i
can
imagine
me
drinking
this
sitting
in
an
australian
caffee
a
pretzel
at
the
side
however
i
was
promised
and
had
payed
for
something
special
a
whiff
of
the
scottish
highlands
a
whisky
malt
red
beer
aged
for
two
months
preferably
in
ancient
oak
barrels
not
really
sure
if
that
was
what
i
got
interesting
malty
beer
with
nice
twist
on
using
whiskey
malt
this
by
the
way
worked
well
assertive
and
not
complex
which
is
nice
so
you
can
better
isolate
its
particular
malt
worth
trying
o
saw
this
in
michael
jacksons
top
500
beers
of
the
world
and
having
the
opportunity
to
buy
this
around
my
40th
birthday
i
decided
to
do
so
at
first
glance
and
based
on
the
reading
on
the
bottle
whiskey
malt
red
beer
it
makes
me
think
of
some
american
ambers
but
this
one
is
way
more
complex
with
the
whiskey
character
i
understand
the
classification
vienna
lager
but
personally
would
not
like
it
to
be
placed
in
that
category
a
malt
whiskey
beer
with
a
scottish
name
nessie
brewed
in
austria
makes
me
think
this
one
is
a
style
in
its
own
right
reminds
me
of
buying
nacho
chips
that
are
a
european
brand
on
the
train
in
sweden
or
a
chinese
version
of
western
food
at
a
high
end
restaurant
in
toronto
cool
bottle
great
concept
o
not
so
goodnot
so
bad
interesting
because
of
whiskey
malt
but
overall
there
is
lots
of
better
red
lagers
while
i
can
see
the
appeal
of
this
as
a
barely
more
interesting
competition
to
innis
gunn
without
the
production
scotch
addition
sorry
but
it
is
the
closest
comparison
it
lack
the
unified
contents
of
a
production
scotch
barrel
beer
or
the
depth
of
a
proper
whisky
malt
beer
that
would
make
it
otherwise
see
unibroue
raftmen
as
a
basic
bottle
conditioned
example
to
be
honest
i
would
take
about
68
other
brands
of
whisky
malt
or
whiskyscotch
barrel
beers
over
this
a
pretty
decent
vienna
lager
i
dont
know
where
all
this
talk
of
scottish
whiskey
barrels
and
highland
malt
is
getting
us
none
of
it
really
manifests
in
the
beer
itself
which
is
fine
by
me
i
like
this
as
it
is
a
wellflavoured
enjoyable
and
altogether
drinkable
malty
lager
this
is
beer
6
from
the
rieder
advent
calendar
it
pours
a
pale
clear
amber
with
a
thin
head
that
remains
for
a
long
while
there
is
a
distinct
sweet
aroma
slightly
reminiscent
of
ryewhiskey
bread
maybe
im
not
crazy
about
the
flavour
theres
a
sharp
metallic
taste
that
doesnt
belong
and
unfortunately
there
arent
really
any
other
flavours
potent
enough
to
mask
it
there
are
some
bready
notes
and
the
whiskey
malt
adds
some
complexity
but
there
just
isnt
much
here
the
finish
is
very
clean
but
weaker
than
i
was
expecting
another
underwhelming
offering
from
this
calendar
o
a
wellcrafted
easy
drinker
a
bit
of
an
eclectic
mix
scottish
ale
and
vienna
lager
but
i
think
it
really
works
now
i
want
to
try
the
previous
stronger
version
o
ehhhh
i
wouldnt
buy
it
again
but
i
will
drink
down
this
bottle
its
not
a
very
flavourful
beer
it
doesnt
taste
offensive
its
just
not
that
exciting
i
was
expecting
a
smokey
peaty
beer
but
the
smoke
is
very
mellow
hard
to
pick
out
not
a
smoked
malt
brew
but
decent
stuff

into

a

half

offwhite
head
dissipates
to
a
film
and

ring
around
the
glass
with

of

malt
dark
fruit
slight
hint
of
whiskey
barrel
flavor
is
thin
sweet
malt
slightly
grainy
finishes
abruptly
with
only
slight
hints
of
malt
and
grain
the
aroma
is
nice
but
the
flavor
is
very
thin
tastes
almost
watered
down
body
is
light
and
uninspiring
i
remembered
this
being
really
mediocre
a
few
years
ago
but
after
trying
other
beers
from
this
brewery
thought
maybe
i
had
tried
an
old
or
bad
bottle
decided
to
give
it
another
taste
this
is
a
very
pleasant
beer
trying
to
escape
from
too
much
dilution
im
sorry
its
a
miss
it
is
decent
would
love
to
try
it
fresh
the
beer
is
lightmedium
in
body
but
bears
little
wateriness
carbonation
is

but
not
prickly
just
makes
the
beer
foam
up
a
bit
on
the
palate
fairly
refreshing
feeling
finish
is
dry
o
id
swear
that
this
was
a
cheap
belgian
strong
dark
ale
very
strange
i
have
another
bottle
not
nearly
as
bad
as
i
thought
it
would
be

not

a

malt
some

i
cant
find
the
whiskey
anywhere
in
this
beer
i
enjoyed
drinking
it
but
its
not
exactly
what
i
expected
overall
the
body
of
the
beer
is
medium
with
a
medium
finish
this
beer
is
good
but
not
great
final
notes
this
beer
is
alright
its
not
what
i
want
in
a
scottish
ale
though
it
could
use
twice
as
much
malt
as
it
has
in
it
disappointing
i
was
hoping
for
something
more
like
the
samichlaus
in
this
brew
ended
up
being
a
little
disappointed
this
beer
has
a
nice
reddish
color
and
thats
about
as
far
as
it
went
for
me
on
the
positives
of
this
brew
i
really
wanted
to
enjoy
this
but
i
found
this
beer
to
be
on
the
weak
side
a
bit
i
was
surprised
the
aromas
didnt
really
do
too
much
for
me
it
smelled
a
little
funny
not
sure
how
to
put
it
really
the
head
vanished
and
it
was
a
little
on
the
flat
side
scottish
ales
are
usually
very
good
to
me
but
this
one
just
didnt
make
the
cut
as
an
edit
to
my
post
always
possible
i
got
a
bad
batch
though
i
am
not
getting
much
of
the
malt
that
other
people
mentioned
i
like
to
review
first
and
then
compare
to
what
others
have
said
i
am
very
sad
if
this
is
just
a
bad
bottle
as
i
will
likely
never
give
it
another
go
again
sounded
like
itd
be
a
great
one
to
go
for
though
this
is
just
not
me
and
i
just
cannot
appreciate
this
if
i
have
what
is

at

becomes

with
hints
of
caramel
and
a
touch
of
whiskey
lots
of
toasted
malt
and
caramel
in
the
taste
along
with
some
nuttiness
grass
vanilla
and
a
touch
of
oak
nice
dry
but
slightly
syrupy
mouthfeel
kept
waiting
to
taste
some
whiskey
but
sadly
it
never
appeared
and
since
the
label
says
its
known
as
the
whiskey
among
the
beers
not
with
malt
but
with
sweetness
the
rest
of
the
smell
is
spot
on
too
some
dark
cherry
is
simply
boring
theres
nothing
going
on

has
a
good
level
of
carbonation
with
a
crisp
but
slightly
medium
bodied
mouthfeel
overall
this
is
a
good
beer
that
is
tasty
and
easy
to
drink
the
palate
opens
moderately
sweet
with
whole
wheat
breadyum
brown
sugar
a
little
buckwheat
honey
and
the
hop
flavors
am
not
earth
and
lemon
hop
bitterness
is
medium
low
with
a
pleasant
earthy
bite
medium
in
im
body
with
a
long
sweetish
finish
with
bread
brown
sugar
and
earthy
hops
this
beer
is
very
smooth
on
the
palate
carbonation
is
creamy
and
delightful
quite
clean
on
the
palate
as
well
i
dont
detect
any
obvious
flaws
though
their
is
a
hint
of
sulfur
way
in
the
back
thoroughly
enjoyable
the
body
was
good
a
bit
lighter
than
normal
not
as
sticky
as
you
often
find
and
with
a
crisp
finish
drinkability
was
very
good
if
i
had
had
a
six
pack
i
probably
would
have
drank
34
of
them
overall
a
pretty
tasty
brew
not
typical
for
the
style
but
very
enjoyable
indeed
worth
trying
when
you
see
it
overall
this
beer
is
wellcrafted
and
balanced
but
the
brewers
chose
to
focus
on
a
flavor
profile
that
just
doesnt
suit
my
palate
i
do
recommend
this
beer
though
it
is
not
exactly
for
me
o
quite
tasty
if
not
the
most
glamorous
of
styles
i
drained
about
half
the
pint
while
finishing
this
quick
little
review
and
i
think
that
says
a
lot
about
what
this
is
o
pretty
much
reminds
me
of
a
less
hoppy
and
more
sweet
version
of
a
sa
boston
lager
o
slightly
roasted
and
darker
lager
than
usual
refreshing
drinkability
is
pretty
high
a
fairly
tasty
satisfying
vienna
larger
that
is
full
enough
to
satisfy
but
balanced
enough
to
session
the
malt
is
well
show
cased
but
i
could
use
less
phenols
poured
into
a
warsteiner
pokal
pours
medium
coppery
amber
with
a
two
finger
white
head
retained
by
active
carbonation
spicy
aroma
of
biscuit
malt
slightly
nutty
with
an
unusual
cola
component
flavor
of
bready
and
biscuit
malt
light
toasted
brown
bread
slightly
sweet
with
a
pleasant
slightly
spicy
lightly
toasted
biscuit
malt
finish
light
bodied
with
active
carbonation
this
is
very
nicely
made
in
a
style
that
often
is
encountered
as
a
mass
market
beer
if
this
is
true
to
the
vienna
lager
style
im
sorry
ive
missed
a
great
example
all
these
years
subtly
flavored
but
refreshing
and
delicious
i
enjoyed
this
more
as
i
drank
the
bottle
and
boosted
the
taste
rating
a
bit
as
a
result
this
is
a
nice
light
lager
for
whatever
reason
this
brewery
just
recently
popped
into
my
local
area
dont
worry
im
not
arguing
just
expressing
the
surprise
at
the
randomness
thats
all
and
this
is
the
first
im
gonna
try
why
not
right
it
pours
a
clear
auburncopper
topped
by
a
finger
of
lightly
offcream
foam
the
nose
comprises
candied
orange
peel
light
brown
sugarcinnamon
and
a
healthy
dose
of
biscuit
the
taste
brings
in
more
of
the
same
with
the
piloncillo
sugar
really
shining
through
providing
a
nice
sweetening
foil
to
the
biscuity
mass
interpenetrating
with
it
the
body
is
a
light
medium
with
a
light
moderate
carbonation
and
a
fluid
feel
overall
a
pretty
nice
vienna
one
that
showcases
the
quasiexotic
sugar
quite
well
not
a
bad
debut
for
these
guys
its
their
debut
for
me
anyway
i
can
understand
why
it
won
a
gabf
medal
in
2013
pours
copper
in
color
with
a
large
pillowy

quickly

toasted

aroma
with
some
light
noble

cutting
through

flavor
very
rich
but
with
a
good
hop
bite
as
well
finishes
dry
and
super
smooth

clean
a
really
nice
lager
from
neshaminy
creek
pairs
well
with
grilled
meats
and
veggies
serving
type
can
i
am
not
a
lager
fan
and
this
is
really
smooth
like
it
better
than
brooklyn
or
sam
adams
as
well
as
a
lakefront
right
out
of
the
can
but
it
looks
amber

tastes
like
how
it

feel
it
was
like
a
better
yuengling
i
like
this
but
most
likely
for
a
while
would
not
buy
again
but
i
do
enjoy
almost
every
beer
ive
had
from
this
brewery
o
very
solid
nice
toast
and
rich
malt
character
but
still
light
and
clean
first
sip
reveals
a
very
clean
and
crisp
textured
beer
with
very
fine
tingly
carbonation
flavor
is
sweet
caramel
and
some
husky
grain
i
do
get
a
little
spicy
hops
on
the
finish
that
linger
with
some
bitterness
actually
dries
my
palate
out
pretty
well
on
each
sip
the
beer
goes
down
very
easy
and
is
simple
and
decent
no
flaws
anywhere
but
not
overly
complex
or
bold

i
was
expecting
more

not
your
typical
lager
in
a
good
and
bad
way
jeremy

was
the
first
microbrewer
putting
his

explain
to

brimful

the
rule
it
cuts
down
on
the
possibility
of
any
oxygenated
headspace
before
the
lid
is
seamed
on
of
course
this
one
was
brimful
when
i
cracked
it
open
an
inverted
glug
netted
me
not
quite
two
fingers
of
dense
tawny

slowly
fell

a
rather
refreshing

quite

lager
very
drinkable
overall
i
am
very
impressed
extremely
tasty
i
recently
had
brooklyn
lager
which
is
rated
very
high
for
this
style
and
i
most
say
churchville
lager
is
every
bit
better
in
all
aspects
it
has
the
looks
the
taste
the
body
and
just
that
overall
enjoyiness
a
must
try
this
could
possibly
be
ncbcs
best
beer
to
date
poured
into
a
pint
as
a
cloudy
deep
amber
with
a
thin
finger
of
creamy
head
smells
light
and
toasted
tastes
toasted
and
light
caramel
malts
fairly
smooth

lacking

any
memorable
characteristics

with

somewhat

the

balanced
with
bread
caramel

grain
malt
flavors
finishes
dry
with
a
mild
lingering
grassy
bitterness
adequate
but
not
the
best
beer
from
their
lineup
overall
simply
wow
ive
never
had
a
beer
like
this
and
i
want
more
and
more
its
a
terribly
wonderful
complex
mix
of
flavors
ive
not
had
elsewhere
though
its
only
got
25
ibu
i
think
the
noble
hops
here
shine
enough
to
keep
the
tartness
noticeable
and
a
wonderful
counterpoint
to
the
sweet
caramel
but
then
theres
a
roasted
bbqed
something
in
there
that
is
lovely
and
hits
the
nerve
endings
that
crave
salt
and
umami
the
mouthfeel
is
also
a
lovely
contradiction
of
sensations
thick
creamy
loveliness
with
crisp
dry
tartness
the
mouth
can
concentrate
on
one
flavor
one
mouthfeel
and
then
the
other
then
the
next
and
keep
going
back
and
forth
into
a
focused
point
where
they
all
become
one
unique
flavor
this
is
a
really
unique
wow
beer
i
havent
ever
had
anything
like
this
and
i
absolutely
love
this
beer
and
it
certainly
feels
like
a
beer
thats
got
a
lot
more
alcohol
than
it
says
on
the
label
by
which
i
mean
it
feels
like
a
doppelbock
or
6
märzen
it
veers
into
märzen
beer
territory
then
becomes
a
liquid
bbq
then
a
pils
in
its
tartness
and
then
back
and
then
whisky
notes
again
wowow
beer
and
a
4
8
of
5
i
certainly
didnt
expect
this
beer
to
knock
my
beerwowmeter
off
kilter
and
im
so
happy
it
did
o
quite
disappointing
a
wellmade
lager
is
generally
crystal
clear
whereas
this
thing
is
muck
its
possibly
quite
old
but
with
no
dating
on
the
bottle
how
could
you
know
just
a
sweet
muddled
mess
i
definitely
wont
try
this
one
again
unless
i
know
its
fresh
summary
not
bad
i
had
this
with
pork
tacos
it
went
well
with
the
meat
but
once
i
hit
a
spicy
pocket
the
beer
clashed
with
it
id
recommend
this
with
a
burger
or
pizza
something
not
spicy
still
this
does
seem
like
a
respectable
effort
from
this
newer
texas
brewery
and
it
does
have
enough
going
for
it
to
recommend
i
plan
to
offer
some
bottles
to
friends
tomorrow
just
to
see
what
they
think
it
isnt
outstanding
but
i
predict
most
everyone
who
tries
it
will
find
it
worthy
of
a
second
bottle
on
tap
at
garland
mall
pours
dark
amber
with
long
lasting
fluffy
white
head
aroma
is
of
caramel
malt
and
hops
body
is
medium
and
crisp
taste
is
of
grapefruity
hops
and
caramel
malt
finish
is
long
citrusy
i
would
prefer
noble
hops
in
this
brew
a
good
lager
for
the
most
part
not
among
the
better
lagers
available
from
texas
breweries
but
still
very
enjoyable
one
of
my
favorite
styles
and
i
am
glad
to
grab
a
sixer
lightmedium
bodied
crisp
beer
i
guess
this
a
good
replacement
for
bmc
if
you
live
in
dallas
i
would
drink
pretty
much
every
other
beer
lakewood
makes
over
this
though
taste
has
alot
of
the
toast
but
it
is
balanced
by
a
sweet
doughy
caramel
hops
are
still
pretty
nonexistent
but
there
is
a
light
drying
bitterness
on
the
finish
a
little
leafy
even
its
a
fairly
good
lager
one
i
would
be
happy
to
order
on
tap
at
a
restaurant
but
it
really
doesnt
do
a
whole
lot
to
distinguish
itself
from
the
pack
of
vienna
lagers
if
i
had
the
choice
id
rather
grab
a
penn
pilsner
firebrick
or
elliot
ness
the
beer
pours
an
orangecopper
color
with
a
white
head
the
aroma
is
very
malty
with
some
biscuit
and
bread
notes
as
well
as
some
toffee
and
a
bit
of
sugar
the
flavor
is
also
very
malty
there
is
good
toffee
and
caramel
in
the
flavor
as
well
as
some
sweet
biscuit
malt
there
is
also
a
hint
of
grass
medium
mouthfeel
and
medium
carbonation
i
used
to
enjoy
this
beer
but
i
opened
one
today
and
poured
it
down
the
sink
the
aroma
is
completely
wrong
for
an
amber
ale
and
reminds
me
of
a
coors
lite
if
i
had
any
i
would
do
a
comparison
the
taste
of
this
beer
is
also
terrible
and
is
reminiscent
of
a
budmillercoors
lager
and
is
not
anything
like
an
amber
ale
there
is
a
faint
hint
of
toasty
malt
but
the
aftertaste
is
more
like
that
of
a
cheap
lager
this
beer
is
also
very
sweet
overall
its
whatever
its
not
a
standout
beer
but
its
not
terrible
either
a
pretty
average
amber
lager
no
bells
or
whistles
nothing
memorable
in
a
good
or
bad
way
definitely
a
blue
collar
beer
at
an
inflated
price
high
hopes
came
with
a
very
nice
pour
of
clear
honey
color
a
2
finger
head
and
plenty
of
carbonation
head
slowly
subsided
and
disappeared
in
about
2
minutes
but
left
some
lace
about
halfway
down
the
initial
aroma
was
faint
but
pleasant
sweet
malt
but
went
away
quickly
never
to
return
again
i
liked
the
carbonation
and
crisp
mouthfeel
but
taste
was
blah
to
be
kind
with
some
kind
bitter
not
in
a
nice
hoppy
way
after
taste
ill
pass
on
any
more
of
these
not
a
bad
beer
have
had
better
this
is
a
solid
good
tasting
amber
lager
for
a
good
price
this
beer
has
a
nice
balance
of
hops
and
malt
flavors
very
surprised
very
nice
not
too
hoppy
the
rating
asks
for
smell
this
doesnt
smell
like
it
supposed
to
beer
is
flavorful
and
a
great
texture
only
one
word
necessary
meh
great
taste
with
a
nice
price
good
taste
and
good
value
pours
with
a
small
white
head
the
beer
is
golden
in
color
initial
aroma
is
stench
and
of
a
pale
lager
tastes
likes
a
generic
amber
lager
with
a
hint
of
hops
goes
down
slightly
harsh
overall
not
a
good
quality
beer
but
i
have
had
worse
yuengling
but
not
quite
as
good
suck
it
coors
i
dont
think
much
when
i
drink
this
beer
that
it
is
light
sweet
juicy
and
cold
is
all
that
matters
that
its
a
coors
product
isnt
even
on
the
screen
coors
needs
to
stick
to
what
they
do
best
manufacturing
swill
o
too
sweet
for
me
and
with
a
weird
metallic
taste
that
was
off
putting
nice
beer
to
drink
i
had
this
on
tap
i
was
pleasantly
surprised
i
thought
this
was
a
very
decent
beer
for
a
lager
from
a
big
company
like
millercoors
youd
expect
hardly
any
flavor
this
one
does
have
flavor
and
it
was
good
i
would
drink
it
again
overall
i
did
not
care
for
the
bottled
version
but
this
review
comes
from
a
16
ounce
can
brewed
in
ft
worth
miller
and
it
is
much
better
than
the
bottled
version
i
hate
to
say
this
as
a
long
time
union
member
but
the
boys
in
ft
worth
are
brewing
some
excellent
beers
check
out
the
fosters
oil
cans
from
the
same
brewery
best
fosters
ever
the
can
date
jun
16
2014
has
to
be
the
brewed
on
date
cause
this
beer
was
really
tasty
poured
from
a
brown
12
oz
bottle
has
a
dark
golden
color
with
a
12
inch
head
smell
is
very
mild
some
light
malts
taste
is
also
mild
malty
a
bit
of
grains
refreshing
but
bland
feels
light
in
the
mouth
and
overall
not
terrible
but
nothing
special
about
this
beer
awesome
this
is
a
really
good
lager
for
after
a
long
day
at
work
the
6
pack
is
really
cheap
at
5
and
some
change
i
really
like
this
beer
i
will
keep
this
beer
in
my
fridge
i
really
dont
know
what
else
to
write
because
it
keeps
saying
invalid
comment
length
this
is
basically
a
plain
old
amber
beer
with
nothing
else
to
differentiate
it
drinkable
for
sure
but
there
are
much
better
beers
to
be
had
bought
a
6pack
of
this
at
the
grocery
store
liquor
store
because
i
noticed
it
was
on
sale
drank
from
the
bottle
poured
into
my
beer
glass
tried
it
both
cold
and
again
when
it
warmed
to
room
temperature
i
really
liked
the
appearance
of
this
one
a
rich
golden
red
12
head
that
dissipated
very
rapidly
very
very
light
lacing
on
the
glass
the
carbonation
was
decent
but
almost
too
much
for
my
taste
very
light
smell
hard
to
pick
it
up
but
id
describe
it
as
wheaty
with
a
light
caramel
apple
in
the
background
taste
was
excellent
very
flavorful
but
not
too
strong
or
overpowering
malt
grass
citrus
and
apple
with
a
very
light
bitter
citrus
aftertaste
i
actually
liked
the
beer
better
after
it
warmed
up
to
room
temperature
the
taste
became
much
more
sweet
and
defined
i
had
mixed
feelings
about
this
beer
before
trying
it
i
had
heard
good
things
about
it
but
wasnt
sure
how
it
would
be
especially
since
its
made
by
coors
im
happy
to
say
that
i
really
enjoyed
this
beer
and
would
definitely
drink
it
again
o
not
too
shabby
nonoffensive
as
one
might
expect
but
the
flavor
really
is
pretty
decent
wouldnt
search
it
out
but
it
presents
a
nice
alternative
to
standard
bmc
aals
i
didnt
realise
this
was
made
by
coors
when
i
bought
it
on
holiday
in
america
its
a
shame
as
i
couldve
brought
something
else
back
unfortunately
it
just
tastes
the
same
as
coors
light
with
a
slightly
more
bitter
backbone
maybe
im
bias
as
it
took
up
a
space
in
my
suitcase
something
else
couldve
but
its
an
experience
and
at
least
i
know
for
next
time
solid
beer
the
appearance
was
the
first
thing
that
stood
out
to
me
i
drank
it
from
an
imperial
pint
glass
that
really
made
the
carbonation
look
cool
coming
up
the
side
and
gliding
off
the
ridge
theres
some
really
cool
amber
notes
in
there
and
its
very
drinkable
the
mouthfeel
is
really
really
nice
carbonated
but
still
smooth
definitely
found
a
new
fridge
staple
overall
a
run
of
the
mill
amber
lager
there
is
little
to
suggest
that
this
resembles
a
vienna
lager
in
any
way
a
beer
for
the
masses
luckily
i
scored
two
cases
of
this
still
fresh
for
under
20
not
really
recommended
but
i
suppose
it
has
it
place
im
drinking
this
as
we
speak
from
a
bottle
the
mouthfeel
is
pretty
good
the
taste
is
average
not
a
drain
pour
but
not
the
best
either
it
really
doesnt
have
a
smell
overall
its
an
okay
beer
but
i
dont
see
myself
buying
a
six
pack
anytime
in
the
near
future
overall
a
very
fine
and
drinkable
beer
it
is
a
darker
amber
color
the
scent
isnt
very
strong
but
is
earthy
with
a
malty
scent
it
tastes
malty
and
oaky
slight
hops
and
slight
sweetness
as
well
has
a
simple
finish
with
a
hint
aftertaste
of
the
earthiness
overall
an
average
amber
lager
dessert
cannot
say
anything
commendable
but
not
as
horrifically
poisonous
as
overall
review
average
denotes
believe
people
skewed
by
fact
its
coors
under
a
different
label
third
shift
amber
lager
brewed
by
coors
brewing
company
this
brew
pours
out
a
dark
amber
color
with
a
small
white
head
i
like
the
color
of
this
brew
not
too
light
but
not
too
dark
third
shift
has
a
an
abv
of
5
3
the
smell
is
rich
and
sweet
there
is
nothing
bad
about
the
smell
of
this
brew
the
taste
is
rich
with
a
hit
of
sweetness
but
a
bitterness
at
the
end
for
being
a
dark
amber
brew
it
is
well
balanced
no
hard
after
taste
at
the
end
this
brew
is
not
overpowering
but
not
underpowering
third
shift
amber
goes
down
smooth
with
a
little
bit
of
bitterness
at
the
end
over
all
im
giving
this
brew
a
3
75
out
of
5
it
is
not
something
i
would
drink
everyday
but
i
would
get
this
brew
again
a
triumphant
4
is
earned
in
my
opinion
i
loved
the
roasted
malt
taste
without
unwanted
sweetness
i
will
certainly
buy
this
brew
again
its
a
great
alloccasion
any
day
of
the
week
type
of
brew
im
willing
to
bet
it
makes
killer
brats
too
i
am
copying
these
notes
over
from
ratebeer
it
does
not
require
as
long
of
review
i
tasted
this
some
time
ago
so
i
cant
add
anything
taste
dry
and
crispy
at
first
which
mellows
well
into
sweet
maltiness
some
crushed
aspirin
at
the
end
overall
i
would
consider
this
an
american
redamber
lager
not
a
vienna
lager
it
looks
o
k
it
has
no
smell
it
tastes
adjunctant
mouth
feel
is
best
but
most
of
all
where
are
the
noble
hops
i
dont
know
what
coors
master
brewers
were
thinking
at
least
blue
moon
was
pretty
good
aside
from
a
pretty
good
look
this
is
what
i
would
point
to
as
average
in
every
way
meh
middle
of
the
road
amber
more
dull
maltyness
more
off
putting
metal
and
plastic
notes
just
not
really
doing
it
for
me
cmon
coors
if
you
are
going
to
try
to
get
part
of
the
craft
beer
pie
make
a
true
tasty
craft
kinda
tasting
beer
i
can
drink
this
its
not
a
good
beer
but
its
cheap
and
the
price
is
right
its
better
than
other
cheap
swill
in
this
range
like
old
milwaukee
natty
and
keystone
again
wet
dog
oi
would
not
buy
this
beer
again
and
was
let
down
a
bit
but
judge
the
beer
by
its
cover
its
funny
how
the
first
couple
of
quick
gulps
are
pleasant
but
the
funny
flavors
emerge
to
the
detriment
of
drinkability
from
the
12
oz
bottle
purchased
at
a
vons
supermarket
im
sure
i
thought
this
was
new
belgium
shift
when
i
bought
it
decent
and
for
a
coors
product
that
is
saying
something
this
stuff
has
the
color
of
a
damn
good
craft
beer
color
of
your
piss
if
you
dont
drink
water
after
a
week
or
so
the
taste
and
mouthfeel
is
oh
man
i
dunno
what
the
hell
it
is
only
thing
it
has
going
is
its
looks
its
darker
than
your
regular
american
adjunct
lagers
so
i
thought
what
the
hell
until
i
tasted
it
oh
man
it
lives
up
to
its
name
of
a
bunch
of
drunks
on
3rd
shift
making
beer
believe
that
folks
not
bad
and
would
drink
it
again
if
handed
to
me
poured
slightly
warm
with
a
nice
creamcolored
foamy
thick
head
that
soon
settled
to
a
ring
and
some
scummy
islands
and
a
bit
of
lace
color
is
a
clear
amber
with
some
bubble
trails
aroma
is
fresh
beer
with
a
little
malt
flavor
is
dominated
by
corn
sweet
has
some
malt
and
carbonic
tang
with
a
hint
of
hop
bitter
its
also
shallow
body
is
a
little
thin
and
carbonation
a
tad
sharp
finish
is
like
flavor
trends
medicinal
and
is
forgettable
this
is
just
drinkable
and
will
be
my
firstlast
i
was
really
suprised
on
the
smell
i
was
not
expecting
it
to
smell
so
nice
and
sweet
i
took
a
sip
and
swore
i
had
tasted
this
before
i
had
dogbite
high
gravity
lager
and
it
tastes
similar
however
this
is
much
smoother
as
for
the
appearance
it
has
an
amazing
color
the
look
i
am
not
sure
of
drinking
straight
from
the
bottle
i
never
drink
lager
beer
so
this
is
new
smell
kind
of
sweet
like
honey
very
pleasant
taste
the
first
one
was
kind
of
strong
for
me
with
a
strong
aftertaste
i
really
enjoyed
the
second
easy
to
drink
kinda
sweet
and
for
6
28
for
a
sixpack
that
is
a
great
value
we
cant
all
drink
the
best
but
i
recommend
this
12oz
bottle
bought
this
at
noon
on
a
sunday
in
bay
city
tx
at
a
gas
station
best
thing
in
the
store
it
pours
a
clear
amber
color
there
was
a
small
offwhite
head
on
it
that
didnt
linger
long
or
leave
much
lacing
the
aroma
isnt
too
bad
malts
a
little
grainy
and
earthy
it
isnt
great
but
really
doesnt
taste
too
bad
a
bit
of
caramel
malt
sweetness
a
little
grainy
and
just
a
touch
of
grassy
hops
itll
do
in
a
pinch
o
the
smooth
lager
feel
is
very
pleasant
but
nothing
else
really
stands
out
o
an
good
example
of
my
favorite
lager
styles
with
good
hops
and
malt
character
o
this
beer
tastes
less
maltier
and
a
little
watered
down
when
compared
to
other
beers
in
the
style
but
is
easy
to
drink
and
doesnt
have
any
off
flavors
pours
a
clear
honey
orange
with
a
foamy
beige
head
that
settles
to
a
partial
film
on
top
of
the
beer
tiny
dots
of
lace
form
around
the
glass
on
the
drink
down
smell
is
of
sweet
malt
grain
and
slight
grassy
aromas
taste
is
much
the
same
with
malt
biscuit
and
metallic
flavors
on
the
finish
there
is
a
mild
amount
of
hop
bitterness
on
the
palate
with
each
sip
this
beer
has
a
lower
level
of
carbonation
with
a
slightly
crisp
mouthfeel
overall
this
is
a
below
average
beer
that
tastes
pretty
decent
but
the
metallic
aspect
detracts
from
things
overall
ill
drink
this
one
but
id
likely
skip
over
it
next
time
it
isnt
a
bad
beer
but
theres
nothing
that
really
makes
me
want
more
and
more
if
you
like
malty
beers
than
you
might
pick
this
one
up
even
better
its
often
on
sale
its
officially
my
sale
lager
its
a
great
lager
with
food
its
very
drinkable
kind
of
like
a
watery
boston
lager
except
significantly
less
bitter
its
a
little
thick
on
the
tongue
but
hey
a
very
drinkable
and
fairly
decent
beer
from
coors
i
wouldnt
trade
my
sam
adams
for
it
but
i
could
definitely
drink
it
again
bready
sweet
aroma
pours
an
orange
amber
body
with
full
but
short
lasting
beige
head
head
quickly
turns
to
thin
oily
film
no
lacing
taste
follows
nose
sweet
and
bready
acidic
aftertaste
if
i
could
use
a
one
word
description
meh
watered
down
sam
adams
lager
at
best
o
nothing
special
but
i
would
drink
it
again
if
nothing
else
was
available
overall
decent
brew
but
nothing
special
it
was
good
good
with
my
burger
i
had
easy
to
drink
o
not
a
bad
attempt
at
a
vienna
but
it
is
more
an
amber
its
doesnt
have
enough
hops
as
vienna
should
be
very
drinkable
and
not
bad
i
will
be
getting
a
full
case
of
this
to
experiment
further
overall
thirstquenching
and
flavorful
even
if
it
is
coors
its
not
a
bad
product
o
better
than
i
expected
after
all
the
advertising
a
decent
brew
that
friends
can
share
around
the
barbecue
pit
pretending
they
have
a
rare
craft
beer
and
feeling
better
about
themselves
ive
given
third
shift
a
3
0
rating
as
a
good
example
of
the
ultramalty
beer
style
actually
its
closer
to
an
ale
but
its
not
to
my
taste
i
really
dont
like
heavy
malty
beers
or
ales
but
if
you
do
then
this
one
should
please
you
just
pretend
its
brewed
by
the
insane
poison
stoner
brewery
and
youll
get
past
any
biases
you
may
be
harboring
tasty
well
balanced
beer
with
good
hops
and
malt
flavor
mouthfeel
is
pretty
good
very
drinkable
overall
very
good
for
a
massmarket
craft
beer

though
so
had
i
researched
it
a
bit
more
i
may
have
passed
on
it
once
i
discovered
it
was
from
coors
that
in
itself
should
say
something
to
any
coors
representatives
reading
this
review
however
i
really
enjoyed
it

more

a

this
for
sure
a
step
up
from
your
typical
bmc
beers
and
if
this
was
at
a
party
or
i
was
offered
it
overall
a
good
beer
to
try
if
you
want
to
sample
lagers
that
arent
made
for
heavilyadvertised
mass
consumption
otherwise
not
a
personal
favorite
cloudy
amber
colored
pour
with
a
small
offwhite
head
great
malty
aroma
with
hints
of
caramel
yeast
and
toast
taste
follows
the
nose
with
caramel
and
bready
malt
flavors
upfront
slightly
sweet
taste
that
also
has
a
nice
cereal
grain
presence
with
just
a
hint
of
hops
light
to
medium
bodied
and
drinks
really
easy
very
well
done
beer
true
to
the
stylevery
drinkable
pretty
tasty
i
would
say
give
this
one
a
try
this
is
a
fine
fine
vienna
a
very
well
made
lager
i
enjoy
this
more
and
more
with
each
sip
i
love
the
style
and
am
glad
there
is
a
good
readily
available
texas
option
o
fantastic
sixpack
i
loved
it
all
the
way
through
and
a
perfect
diversion
from
the
hopcrazy
landscape
out
there
right
now
just
enough
sweetness
for
taste
but
not
enough
to
overpower
the
good
toasted
grain
notes
i
will
definitely
be
drinking
this
one
again
this
is
not
a
bad
beer
by
any
means
but
id
rather
drink
the
pjw
30th
anniversary
ale
overall
a
decent
go
to
lager
especially
when
at
a
p
j
wellingtons
location
solid
contract
beer
would
certainly
have
it
again
some
day
overall
3
fuller
bodied
than
expected
with
a
nice
crisp
hop
presence
up
front
that
provides
a
dry
bitterness
that
lingers
over
the
malt
into
a
sweet
and
slightly
dry
finish
some
grassy
pine
notes
countered
by
the
sweeetness
with
hints
of
caramel
toffee
and
biscuit
theres
some
bready
yeast
adding
fullness
and
light
fruit
notes
in
the
finish
well
balanced
and
easy
to
drink
i
was
pleasantly
surprised
by
this
beer
brewed
by
victory
for
pj
whelihans
as
the
name
would
imply
poured
a
clear
copperamber
color
with
a
thin
fizzy
head
fed
by
obvious
carbonation
smell
of
grains
pils
malts
and
light
floral
hops
very
light
light
body
and
light
taste
sweet
german
and
pils
malts
lightly
hopped
with
floral
and
slight
citrus
accents
nothing
special
but
drinkable
at
least
cheers
d
i
would
definitely
order
this
brew
again
there
is
a
p
j
whelihans
right
down
the
road
and
i
can
see
myself
having
quite
a
few
of
these
down
the
road
it
complements
any
hearty
meal
along
with
their
critically
acclaimed
chicken
wings
nice
taste
refreshing
do
it
good
on

goes
well

not

of
my
favorites

started

pretty
good
with
a
decent

that
hung
around
a
little
while
not
much
smell
light
grain
tasted
crisp
enough
a
little
on
dry
side
but
touch
of
sweetness
a
small
lingering
something
wouldnt
exactly
call
it
bitterness
on

mouthfeel
seemed
light
almost
watery
but
to
be
fair
ive
been
drinking
stouts
and
porters
lately
overall
a
good
vienna
but
not
sure
i
would
choose
this
over
say
a
lighter
porter
such
as
anchor
at
good
remains
me
something
sweet
or
ice
cream
boring

not
an
exciting
beer
no

and
didnt
enjoy
the
beer
at
all
not
much
exciting
with
this
one
a
predominately
bitter
taste
with
slight
malt
character
to
mellow
it
a
bit
dont
understand
why
this
beer
scores
so
low
it
is
a
great
example
of
the
style
and
for
a
low
abv
brew
has
great
body
and
flavor
i
find

slightly
more
complex

it
is

it

it
is

first
tried
this
beer
while
i
was
in
new
orleans
i
love
these
kind
of
beers
although
i
didnt
give
it
such
a
high
rating
i
do
have
to
compare
it
to
other
similar
style
beers
this
lager
is
refreshing
and
goes
down
well
when
its
at
its
prime
temp
once
it
warms
up
a
little
the
bitterness
really
starts
to
set
in
i
continue
to
drink
so
it
cant
be
all
bad
excellent
lager
smooth
and
tasty
is
it
exceptioanlly
unique
well
no
but
abita
amber
is
an
outstanding
refreshing
easytodrink
beer
that
you
can
swig
back
while
enjoying
those
are
becoming
harder
and
harder
to
find
tastes
bready
and
lacks
the
awful
chemical
taste
of
many
macro
lagers
and
ambers
id
drink
it
any
day
if
you
are
looking
for
hoppy
or
complex

look
somewhere
else

i
never
bought
this
beer
before
simply
because
i
felt
there
was
nothing
good
about
a
beer
from
louisianna
i
take
that
back
this
is
a
nice
allaround
beer
it
goes
down
smoothly
and
i
must
admit
i
am
a
fan
of
germanstyle
beers
and
this
one
fits
the
bill
ill
buy
it
again
and
will
try
some

i
was
drinking
a

a
touch

caramel

the
flavor
is
much
the
same
although
the
sweetness
ramps
up
a
touch
more
than
the
aroma
would
indicate
again
flavors
are
wonderful
feel
falls
a
little
flat

its
clean
and
refreshing

may
not
even
be

is
all
over
town
this
week
for
fat
tues
mardi
gras
i
find
this
on
the
cloying
side
leaves
both
an
aftertaste
residue
on
the
tongue
that
wears
out
its
welcome
i
guess
my
expectations
of
a
beer
are
based
on
the
definition
of
a
good
guest
nothing
should
be
left
but
pleasant
memories
this
one
needs
a
chaser
no
need
to
release
the
hounds
but
a
cool
glass
of
water
would
be
in
order
pours
a
light
mostly
clear
amber
a
white
head
burns
off
quickly
leaving
just
a
thin
disc
in
parts
the
aroma
is
light
with
nice
fruit
and
biscuit
notes
the
taste
has
nice
malt
tones
with
light
fruit
and
bread
showing
some
nice
depth
it
has
a
light
weight
and
a
thinner
feel
drank
this
in
nola
draft
and
it
was
outstanding
drank
it
again
in

with
a
couple
dozen

excellent

has
a

east
to

nice
balance
between
an
all
day
beer
and
a
dinner
beer
nice
us
take
on
the
style
it
is
a
refreshing
vienna
lager
all
the
right
flavors
are
there
it
would
be
perfect
if
they
were
more
intense
though
pours
a
pretty
amber
in
color
with
close
to
a
1finger
foamy
white
head
that
settles
down
to
a
thin
layer
on
top
some
spotty
lacing
is
seen
the
aroma
is
very
nice
and
consists
of
caramel
malts
and
yeast
like
freshly
baked
french
bread
the
taste
is
pretty
much
the
same
with
good
malts
and
the
bread
flavor
very
smooth
and
tasty
goes
down
very
easy
with
no
bitter
or
harsh
aftertaste
at
all
medium

liked
this

as
well
as

this
is
the
first
beer
i
have
tried
from

other
than
the
over
popular
purple

a
valiant
effort
for
this
amber
nice

very
creamy

retains

a
bland
lager
sure
but
not
an
irredeemable
one
overall
this
delivers
a
nice
bang
for
the
buck
as
flavor
goes
but
the
periphery
is
a
bit
suspect
the
abita
does
look
nice
i
really
like
the
colour
everything
else
is
just
average
except
the
price
a
very
satisfying
malty
lager
with
just
the
right
touch
of
hop
bitterness
and
mild
sugary
sweetness
nicely
balanced
and
very
refreshing
this
is
a
well
crafted
smooth
and
simple
beer
and
theres
nothing
wrong
with
that
taste
palate
the
flavor
has
an
easy
drinking
malty
character
with
mild
sweetness
through
out
it
matches
the
aroma
with
light
nutty
toasted
and
bready
notes
with
a
touch
of
light
hops
for
balance
pours
a
golden
amber
hue
with
a
wispy
one
finger
head
and
sporadic
lacingthe
smell
is
butterscotchtoffee
and
hints
of
fruitthe
mouthfeel
is
medium
bodied
with
above
moderate
carbonation
just
a
little
too
much
for
me
with
tastes
of
butterscotch
and
toffee
malts
and
finished
with
a
herbal
hop
earthiness
and
overall
yeah
its
alright
but
pretty
pedestrian
cheers
overall
a
very
enjoyable
brew
from
abita
this
is
a
very
nice
example
of
the
style
aroma
is
lightly
toasted
malt
no
hops
or
yeast
color
is
a
beautiful
light

sparkly
medium
light

wit
moderate

grainy
rich
and
malty
while
staying
light
and
not
overly
sweet
finish
is
a
little
sweet
should
be
a
little
dryer
refreshing
but
not
boring
this
ale
is
decent
i
got
tired
of
it
though
as
i
had
several
of
these
at
a
variety
of
receptions
this
week
worth
a
try
amber
pours
an
amber
color
with
not
much
head
the
aroma
is
rather
weak
but
some
pale
malts
come
through
the
taste
is
much
of
the
same
pale
malt
flavors
no
hops
and
very
weak
and
light
flavor
carbonation
is
okay
but
overall
weak
flavors
overall
its
pretty
boring
and
average
o
solid
amber
drinks
like
a
light
beer
but
has
good
flavor
overall
there
is
not
much
flavor
to
this
beer
even
the
hoppiness
is
hidden
within
the
acidic
carbonation
o
overall
a
surprisingly
good
beer
and
when
compared
to
style
its
well
above
average
ive
had
this
one
before
and
id
definitely
drink
it
again
o
a
very
nice
amber
ive
been
wanting
to
try
something
from
abita
im
happy
with
this
purchase
but
wouldnt
necessarily
go
out
of
my
way
to
try
it
again
o
unmemorable
not
an
amber
ale
at
all
vienna
lager
as
it
is
listed
is
a
much
more
fitting
description
ok
only
this
is
their
flagship
beer
suited
to
the
cuisine
i
think
overall
balanced
quenching
and
easy
drinking
displaying
bready
and
nutty
notes
with
a
slightly
bitter
finish
worth
a
shout
overall
a
crisp
clean
delicious
lager
theres
something
to
be
said
for
a
straightforward
lager
this
would
be
a
good
goto
beer
in
bars
if
it
was
widely
available
on
draft
in
new
england
overall
a
easy
drinking
beer
great
for
summer
time
drinking
i
expected
a
darker
fuller
flavor
not
on
the
same
level
as
their
tubordog
we
look
forward
to
trying
this
on
draft
overall
this
is
a
very
solid
lager
and
perhaps
abitas
top
yearround
offering
a
good
sessionable
amber
lager
that
i
could
drink
a
few
of
for
sure
oi
wasnt
impressed
with
this
beer
maybe
the
skunk
smell
turned
me
off
early
but
overall
i
wouldnt
recommend
it
outstanding
beer
o
simple
not
too
flavorful
but
unoffensive
amber
poured
this
vienna
lager
from
a
12
oz
bottle
into
a
pint
glass
poured
a
clear
amber
color
produced
a
nice
off
white
head
decent
retention
and
left
behind
excellent
lacing
the
aroma
consisted
of
toasted
and
caramel
malt
medium
in
body
a
foundation
of
malted
grain
hints
of
caramel
and
some
spicy
hops
overall
very
nice
example
of
the
style
o
though
i
normally
dont
enjoy
this
style
theres
enough
flavor
to
keep
me
interested
and
certainly
doesnt
turn
me
off
in
a
way
its
the
perfect
flagship
beer
for
a
louisiana
brewery
since
the
craft
movement
still
hasnt
fully
matured
there
in
the
way
many
other
states
have
it
has
a
moderately
body
a
pleasant
smell
and
a
solid
but
unobtrusive
taste
resulting
in
high
drinkability
really
not
much
to
argue
with
here
any
craft
beer
drinker
in
the
new
orleans
area
knows
that
if
you
go
to
any
run
of
the
mill
bar
abita
amber
is
going
to
be
the
one
craft
beer
on
tap
it
was
hard
rating
this
beer
because
i
partly
think
the
taps
down
on
bourbon
street
are
disgustingly
dirty
so
maybe
that
is
why
it
doesnt
taste
that
good
but
then
again
ive
had
this
beer
from
bottles
and
it
still
doesnt
taste
that
good
to
me
i
always
get
it
because
it
is
either
this
or
drinking
the
watered
down
mainstreams
each
time
however
the
story
is
the
same
i
take
the
first
sip
and
im
like
wow
this
beer
is
pretty
good
tastes
like
any
other
generic
craft
beer
lager
but
as
it
gets
warmer
in
your
hand
thats
when
it
starts
tasting
like
dirty
feet
simple
lager
here
but
the
flavors
are
clean
and
balanced
nicely
overall
an
easy
drinking
beer
but
it
doesnt
jump
out
at
you
if
the
flavors
were
a
little
bolder
this
would
be
a
great
beer
mild
smooth
hint
of
biscuits
and
lightly
toasted
grains
touch
of
euro
hops
in
the
finish
a
decent
example
of
the
style
otherwise
though
theres
not
too
much
going
on
here
kind
of
run
of
the
mill
with
a
very
basic
malt
and
hop
profile
but
drinks
easy
tastepale
malt
caramel
note
nice
soft
mouthfeel
clean
finish
a
nice
casual
lager
sessionable
and
a
step
up
from
your
macrolagers
a
nice
gateway
brew
for
those
just
entering
the
craft
beer
scene
i
cant
get
over
how
brilliant
this
tasted
i
had
it
on
tap
at
a
bar
because
it
was
cheap
and
ended
up
hooked
after
my
first
glass
i
really
hope
i
can
find
it
back
home
away
from
louisiana
overall
pretty
mediocre
you
get
some
maltiness
but
not
a
lot
its
a
cheap
beer
for
a
reason
and
not
worth
drinking
unless
its
a
very
hot
day
overall
i
feel
the
flavors
in
this
beer
are
too
subdued
compared
to
boston
lager
or
great
lakes
eliot
ness
all
of
the
right
components
are
here
but
need
to
be
bolder
nonetheless
it
is
an
easy
drinking
lager
and
very
sessionable
overall
just
an
average
amber
for
me
somewhat
watery
and
metallic
if
anything
medium
bodied
light
effervescence
overall
though
a
bit
of
sharpness
up
front
finish
is
fairly
clean
though
a
breadymalt
note
lingers
a
bit
nothing
to
really
recommend
this
this
sorry
odanother
yawner
in
terms
of
a
vienna
lager
boston
lager
blows
this
ones
face
off
one
bottle
is
enough
for
me
a
very
boring
offering
from
abita
i
thought
i
was
buying
an
amber
ale
and
got
a
vienna
lager
very
sessionable
and
easy
drinking
not
bad
just
boring

on

tasting
with

it
feels
a

body
with

that
is
good
alcohol
is
well

with
pretty

no

present
on

as
expected
overall
this
is
a
good
vienna
lager
some
good
flavor
balance
and
very
smooth
to
drink
quite
enjoyable
and
very
sessionable
overall
its
not
bad
but
doesnt
really
stand
out
in
my
mind
as
a
must
buy
pours
a
clear
light
brown
with
a
foamy
tan

that
fades
to
nothing
no

on
this
one
smell
is
pretty
mild

and
slight

taste
is
of
toasted
malt
caramel
and
some
mild
herbal
hops
on
the
finish
there
is
a
slight
bitterness
on
the
palate
with
each
sip
this
beer
has
a
good
level
of
carbonation
with
a
crisp
mouthfeel
overall
this
is
a
pretty
good
beer
flavor
wise
but
the
smell
is
lacking
in
my
opinion
oa
perfect
beer
for
la
easy
to
drink
with
a
nice
malty
sweetness
a
very
approachable
beer
a
must
when
i
visit
new
orleans
very
smooth
with
low
carbonation
semisweet
dark
fruits
butterscotch
and
caramel
with
a
clean
english
hop
finish
lingering
semi
sweetness
highly
drinkable
and
delectable
a
bit
too
much
dark
fruit
though
and
by
a
bit
i
dont
mean
alot
simply
overpowers
some
of
the
flavors
only
a
tiny
bit
but
that
could
be
from
the
age
of
it
overall
very
good
though
overall
it
is
very
light
and
easy
to
drink
with
a
nice
not
too
sweet
but
sweet
roasted
flavor
a
brew
that
makes
for
a
decent
session
beer
taste
follows
a
very
nonoffensive
easy
drinking
light
abv
brew
with
much
more
taste
than
your
typical
bmc
the
slightly
caramel
flavor
mild
spices
and
medium
carbonation
make
it
quite
easy
to
put
several
of
these
back
in
a
hurry
on
a
hot
day
in
new
orleans
or
where
ever
you
may
reside
overall
a
decent
lager
disappointing
body
whats
there
is
good
but
its
not
very
flavorful
in
the
very
least
its
easy
to
drink
this
was
my
first
abita
product
and
is
one
of
my
favorite
beers
it
was
paired
with
a
muffaletta
sandwich
at
the
worldfamous
central
grocery
in
new
orleans
it
has
a
good
balance
of
malty
flavor
with
just
a
hint
of
hoppy
bitterness
the
rich
amber
color
looks
great
in
a
glass
and
it
pours
an
ideal
in
my
view
head
it
is
a
full
bodied
beer
that
feels
velvetysmooth
in
the
mouth
and
has
a
clean
finish
this
was
an
ok
beer
im
afraid
that
boston
lager
may
hold
a
slightly
higher
rating
than
this
one
in
my
opinion
regardless
very
high
quality
and
true
to
the
style
lovely
beer
if
this
is
vienna
lager
then
i
am
a
fan
of
the
style
overall
a
pretty
straight
forward
amber
lager
with
a
great
drinkability
and
a
pleasant
taste
overallnot
a
bad
amber
good
summer
time
beer
o
very
nice
brew
good
balance
of
crisp
flavors
with
the
malts
and
very
light
bittering
at
the
end
would
def
like
to
try
it
on
tap
pours

a
good

and
has
you
asking
for
another

i
cant

typical
for
the
style
average
mouthfeel
pretty
standard
carbonation
and
density
an
average
beer
nothing
special
probably
my
favorite
offering
from
abita
though
i
can
remember
one
industry
professional
telling
me
that
ambers
are
dead
by
gar
i
hope
not
ambers
take
many
forms
and
knowing
how
difficult
it
can
be
to
work
with
a
lager
yeast
i
am
duly
impressed
that
this
is
not
a
red
ale
i
got
a
rocky
finger
of
tawny
head
off
of
my
pour
and
it
hung
around
as
long
as
it
could
in
the
humidity
of
the
evening
color
was
a
beautiful
orangishamber
with
nequality
clarity
nose
was
very
malty
but
also
very
clean
mouthfeel
was
full
nearly
thick
and
the
malty
sweetness
reminded
me
of
hot
cereal
oatmeal
or
cream
of
wheat
finish
was
semisweet
sweet
but
not
cloying
by
any
means
it
was
very
pleasant
and
would
be
a
nice
beer
to
have
in
the
cooler
on
a
hot
day
or
during
a
visit
to
the
beach
o
not
impressive
but
not
bad
either
a
nice
easy
drinker
with
a
burger
or
some
barbeque
this
is
an
easy
drinking
vienna
lager
it
has
decent
flavor
and
good
body
its
worth
a
try
o
for
what
it
is
this
is
a
solid
choice
ive
enjoyed
a
few
of
these
in
the
crescent
city
and
some
local
cajun
restaurants
overall
this
is
a
easy
drinking
vienna
style
lager
not
hoppy
but
full
of
malt
flavor
and
more
complex
than
you
would
expect
with
so
many
better
options
that
are
just
as
easy
to
get
and
in
my
opinion
much
better
i
doubt
that
i
would
ever
return
to
this
one
o
decent
beer
goes
down
pretty
easy
good
for
a
couple
i
had
been
led
to
believe
that
abita
beers
were
better
than
this
the
lacing
was
the
best
i
had
viewed
in
some
time
i
would
like
to
do
this
beer
again
as
i
did
have
a
small
cold
going
but
was
still
very
enjoyable
poured
from
tap
into
pint
glass
pours
no
head
or
lacing
nice
slightly
fruity
malt
aroma
taste
is
similar
with
a
slightly
fruity
malt
flavor
and
ever
so
slight
hop
easy
drinker
tastey
and
refreshing
seems
to
be
a
nola
staple
and
i
can
see
why
its
nice
after
a
hot
humid
day
good
brew
but
not
amazing
not
a
bad
vienna
a
bit
sweeter
than
i
would
like
but
a
solid
example
of
the
style
o
very
sessionable
doesnt
have
the
astringent
aftertaste
of
many
abita
styles
one
could
drink
this
all
day
and
they
did
at
the
festival
oh
man
did
they
oa
boring
and
slightly
offputting
beer
i
was
hoping
for
more
and
this
was
a
let
down
o
abita
amber
is
a
very
solid
and
enjoyable
viennastyle
lager
an
enjoyable
offering
o
just
a
little
better
than
your
mass
produced
viennas
not
really
worth
another
purchase
at
9
99
a
six
pack
the
taste
is
very
good
and
it
goes
down
extremely
smoothly
this
is
a
wonderful
munich
style
lager
and
i
would
highly
recommend
it
to
anyone
overall
a
decent
vienna
lager
hops
could
stand
to
be
more
assertive
this
stuff
is
good
i
dont
know
why
but
it
made
me
think
of
negro
modelo
and
sam
adams
boston
lager
taking
the
good
elements
of
both
has
a
nice
amber
color
obviously
and
a
good
looking
off
white
head
the
malty
breadiness
are
prevalent
and
its
got
a
clean
grassy
aftertaste
worth
getting
for
sure
certainly
looks
the
part
amber
color
problem
is
the
head
dissipates
to
nothing
quickly
better
than
average
taste
good
mouthfeel
and
carbonation
overall
this
is
a
very
good
representation
of
a
macrocraft
beer
i
bought
it
because
the
on
other
thing
on
draft
was
the
terrible
omb
copper
overall
very
drinkable
and
refreshing
but
not
overly
flavorful
simple
and
one
dimensional
but
appeases
the
standard
beer
drinker
d
easy
drinking
reasonably
pleasant
enough
no
major
flaws
but
quite
unimpressive
not
really
good
as
a
munich
or
a
vienna
lager
alright
for
washing
down
some
food
or
as
a
hot
weather
thirst
solution
overall
drinkability
like
i
said
i
need
to
give
this
one
another
shot
o
its
very
ehh
its
kind
of
like
a
c
student
it
gets
the
job
done
but
you
wouldnt
want
to
copy
off
him
when
it
counts
i
wouldnt
break
out
the
firstclass
hors
doeuvres
to
go
with
this
beer
but
a
small
bag
of
chips
will
do
ya
cheers
i
had
this
on
tap
it
had
the
sort
of
amber
color
youd
expect
from
something
called
amber
it
had
a
white
head
and
lacing
was
left
on
the
glass
during
consumption
there
was
a
light
aroma
of
malt
but
not
much
else
the
taste
was
fairly
mellow
there
was
a
malty
taste
that
was
dry
and
crisp
it
has
a
light
mouthfeel
overall
this
is
an
average
beer
that
is
still
very
popular
in
louisiana
overall
great
amber
only
runs
you
about
7
dollars
for
6
or
around
13
for
12
a
great
session
bier
that
goes
phenominaly
with
spicy
gumbo
and
shrimp
really
brings
out
the
seafood
and
vegetable
tastes
abita
amber
pours
an
appropriate
amber
and
very
clear
color
with
minimal
head
retention
its
pleasant
aroma
consists
of
mainly
sweet
caramel
graininess
the
flavor
follows
suit
with
a
mellow
pleasing
caramel
malt
backbone
which
is
well
balanced
and
not
cloying
the
body
is
a
touch
on
the
thin
side
and
the
beer
finishes
pretty
clean
and
dry
very
drinkable
perhaps
not
as
rich
and
lingering
as
some
viennas
however
i
liked
it
poured
from
a
12oz
bottle
into
a
ale
mug
rich
amber
color
quite
clear
head
is
decent
on
pour
but
dissipates
quickly
not
much
left
on
the
sides
of
glass
no
bubbles
from
bottom
after
pour
malty
buttery
aroma
with
some
copper
notes
taste
is
quite
sweet
and
a
bit
of
bitterness
from
the
hops
at
the
end
very
light
mouthfeel
not
very
carbonated
poured
from
a
bottle
at
wing
central
in
udistrict
aroma
well
i
cant
really
smell
any
unfortunately
its
still
better
than
smelling
cheap
hard
alcohol
or
skunky
main
stream
lagers
but
theres
nothing
good
about
it
for
sure
appearance
is
just
as
boring
dark
orange
to
amber
with
no
head
to
speak
of
hazy
taste
was
bland
its
not
a
bmc
but
i
dont
think
its
a
craft
beer
either
the
only
flavor
that
i
think
i
can
pick
out
is
the
faintest
hint
of
caramel
palate
might
be
the
acceptable
quality
of
this
beer
mainly
because
it
is
carbonated
and
drinkable
overall
not
something
i
would
ever
plan
on
picking
up
again
theres
no
flavor
to
it
and
no
other
redeeming
qualities
its
just
a
lost
cause
tastes
light
thin
bodied
again
no
hops
but
yet
still
a
pronounced
bitterness
metallic
grainy
alcohol
seemed
pronounced
for
its
actual
level
could
feel
it
or
some
off
flavor
as
i
exhaled
the
sweetness
that
was
lacking
in
the
aroma
shows
up
when
drinking
tastes
like
a
sweeter
brown
ale
theres
nothing
terrible
about
this
beer
but
nothing
to
justify
its
almost
10
a
6er
price
crystal
and
vienna
malt
all
the
way
on
this
beer
4
0
d
a
well
crafted
clean
lager
not
a
ton
of
flavor
but
its
definitely
an
easy
drinker
overall
a
great
flavorful
lager
this
beer
pours
a
clear
orange
color
with
12
inch
head
and
no
lace
its
aroma
is
of
bread
crust
honey
and
grass
the
flavor
has
notes
of
honey
dough
nuts
and
sweet
malt
the
mouthfeel
is
light
abita
amber
is
a
good
beer
smooth
refreshing
and
very
drinkable
a
great
session
beer
recommended
o
this
is
a
decent
vienna
lager
but
is
not
all
that
impressive
compared
to
some
other
takes
on
this
style
abita
amber
offers
nothing
new
or
exciting
not
a
bad
beer
overall
it
was
either
this
or
miller
lite
on
the
riverboat
and
of
course
i
stuck
with
the
abita
amber
it
also
felt
right
drinking
this
on
the
mississippi
notes
nicely
balanced
and
drinkable
its
nice
to
find
another
vienna
lager
cheers
a
nice
standard
amber
lager
a
solid
beer
that
some
non
craft
beer
drinkers
may
appreciate
food
pairing
this
is
a
louisiana
beer
so
i
could
see
this
being
paired
well
with
some
gumbo
overall
a
decent
beer
but
maybe
a
bit
too
sweet
simply
average
d
inoffensive
and
perhaps
a
little
bland
but
the
base
flavor
is
good
enough
to
let
most
of
its
simplicity
slide
overall
very
enjoyable
not
a
good
example
of
a
munich
lager
as
advertised
this
beer
has
potential
but
it
loses
me
with
the
finish
clearly
it
is
a
lighter
beer
and
it
is
good
to
have
on
hand
if
you
have
friends
over
who
arent
big
into
craft
beers
id
much
rather
drink
a
few
abita
ambers
left
over
from
a
party
vs
something
from
the
majors
i
think
of
it
as
an
entry
level
craft
ok
but
not
great
a
well
balanced
beer
that
is
appealing
and
easy
to
drink
overall
i
dont
know
if
id
call
this
a
vienna
lager
but
its
quite
pleasant
and
a
decent
session
beer
nice
balance
but
nothing
stands
out
in
keeping
with
the
louisiana
theme
or
more
accurately
drinking
with
friends
who
just
returned
from
new
orleans
i
can
see
this
being
a
second
or
thirdtier
choice
depending
on
my
options
its
a
great
lighter
beer
that
you
can
drink
all
day
in
the
smoldering
la
heat
a
nice
caramel
malt
flavor
ive
had
it
both
in
the
bottle
and
on
tap
for
many
years
but
this
in
one
that
i
actually
drink
straight
from
the
bottle
gasp
flavorful
and
refershing
a
great
combo
as
far
as
mouthfeel
it
felt
a
bit
bready
disappointing
i
was
hoping
for
more
from
an
amber
overall
there
are
much
better
vienna
lagers
out
there
to
try
than
this
one
mouthfeel
is
pretty
lightbodied
with
average
levels
of
carbonation
finishes
on
the
dry
side
and
is
fairly
drinkable
overall
nothing
impressive
here
just
an
average
brew
that
would
be
good
on
a
hot
day
but
not
something
to
seek
out
color
is
amber
duh
with
a
moderatelysized
offwhite
head
that
fades
fairly
quickly
but
there
are
several
nice
lacing
rings
down
the
glass
that
make
for
a
very
nice
looking
beer
the
scent
is
a
very
pleasant
combination
of
caramelbready
malt
and
fruity
citrus
the
taste
follows
the
nose
with
a
nice
balance
of
malt
and
hops
slightly
sweet
caramel
and
bread
notes
up
front
with
a
nice
touch
of
citrus
bitterness
in
the
background
this
doesnt
have
the
grassy
flavor
that
may
other
lagers
have
which
is
a
positive
in
my
book
mouthfeel
is
okay
but
not
great
id
be
glad
to
have
one
of
these
again
overall
i
like
this
beer
as
a
go
to
beer
great
for
bbqs
and
crawfish
boils
it
is
not
a
hoppy
beer
or
super
malty
beer
but
a
good
basic
drinker
that
would
appeal
to
a
lot
of
folks
the
liquid
was
a
hazy
amber
copper
color
with
a
thin
filmy
white
head
the
aroma
consists
of
sweet
roasted
nuts
and
caramel
candy
i
could
taste
mostly
sweet
malt
with
toffee
and
a
slight
earthy
bitterness
it
has
a
light
medium
body
with
sharp
carbonation
and
a
dry
finish
i
thought
this
was
a
good
amber
but
it
is
a
little
on
the
sweet
side
pours
a
nice
typical
amber
with
a
small
white
head
aroma
is
sweet
malts
some
yeastyness
and
frruity
notes
taste
is
same
as
aroma
palate
is
a
medium
body
with
moderate
carbonation
finish
is
malts
with
a
bit
of
roastiness
some
yeast
overall
flavor
and
aroma
were
a
bit
bland
and
subdued
there
are
better
lagers
its
beers
like
this
that
give
ambers
a
bad
name
so
basic
and
boring
in
look
smell
and
flavor
that
you
might
as
well
be
drinking
a
macro
good
beer
from
abita
the
rest
body
is
medium
this
one
is
just
ok
the
dishrag
taste
on
the
finish
reminds
me
of
a
lot
of
not
very
good
brewpub
beer
this
one
is
just
meh
as
i
said
if
youre
looking
for
a
dark
heavy
amber
this
isnt
for
you
id
almost
classiy
this
as
a
summer
ale
sorry
amber
beer
family
youve
taken
a
step
backwards
with
this
one
d
in
my
opinion
just
a
bit
too
much
sweetdarker
malt
that
takes
it
to
a
sweet
lager
versus
a
maltybalanced
vienna
not
much
here
but
its
strong
an
original
microbrew
and
it
gets
a
lot
of
love
when
in
nola
have
yourself
a
damn
abita
overall
not
one
of
the
better
beers
ive
had
just
left
a
lot
to
be
desired
not
a
bad
beer
but
just
not
enough
flavor
for
me
and
maybe
too
much
carbonation
as
well
just
tasted
too
fizzy
overall
the
abita
amber
is
on
the
lighter
side
but
still
an
interesting
beer
if
youre
in
the
mood
for
something
light
and
refreshing
this
would
be
a
good
call
if
you
prefer
a
little
more
body
however
it
might
not
be
the
right
brew
this
beer
poured
out
with
a
pretty
nice
looking
amber
color
the
head
was
cream
colored
and
fizzy
the
smell
had
a
slight
hoppiness
with
some
caramel
malts
in
there
the
taste
was
too
mild
in
my
opinion
i
couldnt
really
pin
point
any
real
specifics
here
other
than
some
malts
and
a
minimal
hop
bitterness
the
mouthfeel
is
on
the
light
side
too
overall
not
the
most
impressive
amber
ale
really
o
id
be
happy
drinking
an
abita
amber
on
a
hot
day
cook
out
canoeing
or
most
anything
out
doors
its
refreshing
without
being
totally
void
of
taste
and
smell
i
know
ambers
are
supposed
to
have
a
reddish
look
and
a
malty
flavor
this
was
more
nutty
and
kind
of
bland
but
once
again
i
like
things
to
bite
me
good
flavor
for
a
weak
beer
good
porchsitting
or
grillout
beer
i
would
think
this
beer
would
do
great
with
bbq
poured
from
a
bottle
into
a
pint
glass
the
beer
is
a
slightly
hazy
bright
orangeamber
color
with
a
light
foamy
fluffy
white
head
that
starts
around
three
inches
and
quickly
disappears
into
a
managable
halfinch
head
great
lacing
just
from
the
head
recession
aroma
is
a
tangy
caramel
with
a
slight
hopped
spice
towards
the
end
flavor
is
a
little
watered
down
but
a
decent
blend
of
caramel
and
hopped
bitterness
the
caramel
is
a
little
roasted
which
balances
nicely
with
green
and
pepper
from
the
hops
tasty
the
body
is
light
and
crisp
and
the
aftertaste
is
roasted
and
slightly
sour
with
a
dry
finish
pretty
decent
and
a
very
easy
drinker
this
beer
has
a
nice
drinkable
feel
and
goes
down
easy
there
is
a
nice
juicy
feel
that
goes
down
easy
crisp
and
clean
simple
but
wellmade
nothing
too
exciting
but
certainly
good
great
to
have
another
vienna
out
there
this
one
is
worth
your
while
mouthfeel
gains
some
ground
but
cant
possibly
overcome
the
shortage
of
flavor
medium
bodied
with
a
sizzle
of
carbonation
gives
this
beer
an
almost
chewy
feel
not
bad
and
very
drinkable
but
shocking
that
the
nose
is
so
different
from
the
taste
d
very
refreshing
beer
with
great
flavor
and
great
balance
between
the
sweet
caramel
malt
spicy
notes
and
mild
hop
bitterness
could
be
a
goto
session
beer
of
mine
but
i
have
never
seen
it
in
six
packs
around
here
i
didnt
realize
this
was
a
lager
until
now
when
i
tasted
it
and
saw
its
classification
you
learn
something
new
everyday
drink
its
okay
as
i
mentioned
a
little
watery
and
sweet
probably
wont
have
this
again
overall
this
was
a
good
local
beer
in
louisiana
i
wouldnt
mind
having
another
one
but
i
wouldnt
rush
back
for
another
this
is
a
very
easydrinking
minimal
but
delicious
brew
which
could
pair
wonderfully
with
warm
days
and
so
many
different
styles
of
food
it
pours
a
brilliant
orange
with
a
quickly
disappearing
white
head
and
smells
of
orange
blossom
honey
caramel
and
walnuts
the
palate
is
clean
crisp
and
minimal
light
bodied
with
light
caramel
notes
and
a
general
freshness
from
the
hops
which
lead
to
a
shorter
but
still
tasty
finish
poured
into
a
pint
glass
this
brew
has
a
standard
amber
color
for
the
style
semi
translucent
in
the
light
with
a
1
finger
white
head
the
aroma
was
strong
of
bread
and
malts
the
flavor
was
mild
and
had
a
nice
balance
of
hop
spice
and
malt
medium
body
moderate
carbonation
nothing
special
but
certainly
better
than
the
normal
big
box
brews
you
get
to
chose
from
at
a
wedding
d
no
mistake
about
it
this
is
a
sessionable
beer
that
would
be
best
drunk
in
the
summer
given
its
lightness
and
low
alcohol
light
amber
in
color
a
good
looking
beer
with
nice
lacing
and
high
carbonation
smells
of
belgian
yeast
and
some
caramel
sweetness
taste
is
the
same
with
a
slight
bite
and
the
end
mouthfeel
is
light
and
drikablity
is
moderate
decent
beer
not
great
but
ok
d
the
beer
is
drinkable
but
nothing
really
sets
it
apart
to
make
me
want
to
have
another
of
these
d
yeah
it
is
drinkable
but
it
doesnt
make
me
want
to
find
it
again
d
probably
wont
try
this
one
again
i
bought
mainly
because
i
wanted
to
try
something
different
if
you
can
get
past
no
taste
you
can
actually
have
at
this
all
day
its
relatively
low
in
alcohol
and
has
a
neutral
taste
amber
in
color
with
a
creamy
head
that
has
good
retention
and
leaves
sheets
of
lace
on
the
glass
caramel
aroma
and
little
else
the
aroma
more
taps
you
on
the
shoulder
than
slaps
you
in
the
face
caramel
flavored
without
being
too
caramelly
a
hint
of
spiciness
its
a
good
beer
not
overly
interesting
but
good
none
the
less
smooth
yet
thin
mouthfeel
this
is
a
good
session
beer
cross
over
beer
or
something
to
turn
to
when
youre
bored
with
sa
boston
lager
conclusion
for
a
beer
that
is
readily
available
this
was
fairly
solid
i
would
put
this
into
the
same
category
as
sam
adams
i
would
even
go
as
far
as
to
say
it
was
better
than
a
boston
lager
this
would
make
a
good
go
to
beer
if
i
was
faced
with
a
limited
selection
at
a
store
or
bar
drinkability
this
is
a
solid
brew
nothing
too
complicated
or
exotic
this
is
a
working
mans
beer
in
my
opinion
would
be
an
excellent
fall
session
beer
could
easily
set
a
few
of
these
back
without
even
thinking
about
it
goes
down
easy
and
without
fuss
drinkabbility
very
drinkable
and
sessionable
while
its
not
an
outstanding
in
flavor
beer
it
is
very
well
balanced
to
the
point
that
it
goes
fast
and
is
just
good
enough
that
you
dont
mind
having
another
its
mild
flavor
profile
makes
it
go
very
well
with
a
lot
of
foods
i
think
i
think
it
would
be
outstanding
with
bbq
burgers
and
a
variety
of
meaty
dishes
poured
a
clear
amber
with
a
nice
two
fingered
off
white
head
with
some
light
lacing
light
malty
aromas
with
a
just
hint
of
hops
crisp
and
neat
on
the
palate
with
just
touch
of
hoppy
bitterness
this
was
for
the
most
part
a
desent
enough
of
a
brew
from
the
folks
at
abita
a
nice
chalky
finish
caps
of
a
a
smooth
medium
bodied
beer
im
drinking
this
one
on
a
full
stomach
and
its
still
going
down
nicely
12
ounce
stubby
bottle
abita
bills
this
as
an
amber
but
it
pours
a
little
more
gold
in
color
pretty
decent
head
with
a
nice
amount
of
foam
smell
is
slightly
skunky
with
an
unmistakable
lager
smell
beyond
the
skunk
smell
theres
a
decent
amount
of
caramel
and
cereal
in
the
nose
with
some
mineral
notes
as
well
light
mouthfeel
a
little
heavy
handed
in
the
carbonation
wish
there
was
more
to
the
body
of
this
beer
it
just
doesnt
really
stand
up
and
seems
like
its
missing
something
the
caramel
taste
comes
rolling
in
but
washes
to
the
sides
of
the
palate
and
is
chased
by
water
i
get
that
abita
is
proud
of
their
water
im
just
not
sure
if
showcasing
it
in
your
beer
is
the
way
to
go
it
has
a
light
amber
colour
and
a
head
that
dies
very
quickly
and
no
lacing
the
smell
is
weak
and
all
i
got
was
some
yeast
and
hops
this
beer
starts
out
malty
with
hints
of
apple
and
some
hops
quite
nice
it
has
some
carbonation
and
so
is
reasonably
ok
in
the
mouthfeel
department
good
drinkability
in
this
one
easily
a
session
beer
this
ale
rates
a
12
on
the
srm
beer
color
chart
with
a
less
than
one
finger
head
after
pour
which
fizzled
down
to
a
thin
ring
of
lace
in
less
than
thirty
seconds
my
nose
detects
an
aroma
of
roasted
corn
wheat
and
sweet
malt
nothing
extra
about
the
taste
but
not
a
bad
blend
of
flavor
taste
of
sour
dough
bread
yeast
corn
and
sweet
malt
little
to
no
bite
in
the
initial
taste
or
finish
feels
sort
of
watery
in
my
mouth
but
i
do
detect
a
little
fizz
buzz
this
is
a
beer
that
is
hard
to
find
unless
your
are
in
the
brewing
area
louisiana
and
it
is
a
little
pricey
compared
to
similar
ale
i
am
glad
i
had
the
chance
to
sample
one
but
i
would
not
go
out
of
my
way
to
have
another
edit
since
this
review
was
posted
ba
has
changed
the
style
of
this
beer
on
their
site
to
a
vienna
lager
my
new
score
indicates
this
change
pours
a
clear
light
goldenorange
color
nice
fluffy
very
slightly
offwhite
head
nice
scattered
carbonation
smell
is
of
mildly
pungent
malt
and
hops
first
taste
is
light
and
airy
then
a
nice
and
big
malt
presence
sits
down
on
the
bottom
it
just
kind
of
sneaks
up
on
me
like
a
ninja
very
tasty
and
clean
definitely
on
the
malty
side
nice
i
like
it
good
session
beer
and
would
pair
well
with
food
its
a
decent
brew
the
flavors
are
pleasant
and
mellow
its
pretty
standard
and
doesnt
stand
out
but
is
still
drinkable
and
refreshing
a
decent
example
for
this
style
abita
is
usually
hit
or
miss
but
this
beer
is
just
right
o
surprised
to
find
i
liked
this
abita
so
much
mainly
due
to
the
very
flavorful
version
of
this
oft
boring
style
this
is
a
solid
maerzen
style
lager
it
may
not
be
called
an
oktoberfest
but
it
does
fall
in
line
with
the
style
drinkability
is
relatively
high
the
beer
is
easily
sessionable
at
4
5
abv
and
the
flavor
profile
is
simple
but
pleasing
i
enjoy
simple
and
clean
beers
more
and
more
each
day
this
beer
has
a
very
nice
color
with
a
small
and
creamy
head
i
find
the
aroma
underwhelming
and
am
surprised
to
pick
up
more
of
a
bright
and
lively
smell
than
i
anticipated
for
an
amber
i
dont
feel
much
carbonation
and
the
beer
goes
down
very
easily
the
taste
is
unoffensive
and
has
little
to
no
hoppy
characteristics
that
i
can
pick
up
on
an
easydrinking
amber
that
can
be
enjoyed
year
round
d
i
find
this
good
but
for
an
amber
or
oktoberfest
ehh
not
so
much
wouldnt
turn
down
but
again
wouldnt
seek
out
i
love
cheap
singles
we
need
more
of
them
at
more
stores
i
tells
ya
this
one
pours
a
clear
well
amber
how
very
appropriate
topped
by
a
finger
or
so
of
white
microfoam
the
nose
is
heavy
on
the
buttery
biscuits
as
though
company
was
expected
some
light
caramel
and
nutmeg
finish
off
a
strange
olfactory
experience
the
taste
also
has
a
good
amount
of
biscuits
but
theyre
not
as
buttery
as
before
some
mild
wheat
light
caramel
and
following
the
theme
very
mild
hoppy
floral
and
citrus
notes
round
out
the
kinda
lackluster
flavor
the
body
is
pretty
light
with
a
light
carbonation
and
a
semicrisp
finish
overall
an
okay
brew
nothing
special
nothing
objectionable
easy
to
down
though
abita
amber
ale
had
a
real
classic
beer
look
to
it
it
was
a
very
clean
clear
brown
with
just
a
hint
of
redness
the
head
is
mostly
white
and
leaves
little
to
no
lacing
on
the
glass
i
dont
have
much
experience
with
amber
style
beers
so
the
the
nose
is
fairly
new
to
me
the
nose
follows
right
on
the
palate
i
definitely
get
a
malty
sweetness
maybe
that
sweetness
is
a
little
bit
of
wheat
i
barely
get
that
bready
grit
feeling
on
the
back
of
my
tongue
on
the
second
sip
the
finish
is
short
leaving
just
enough
sweetness
in
my
mouth
to
want
to
try
another
sip
overall
its
nothing
to
get
too
excited
about
but
still
a
pleasant
easy
drinking
beer
mf
d
not
much
going
on
here
light
and
rather
crisp
again
nothing
special
here
drinkability
a
pretty
average
beer
overall
and
not
something
i
would
be
getting
too
excited
over
not
bad
but
still
far
from
great
d
pretty
drinkable
flavors
arent
huge
pretty
mild
and
uneventful
drinkability
pretty
good
i
would
drink
it
again
abita
made
a
pretty
good
solid
one
wiith
their
amber
a
solid
bottledrinking
beer
great
for
hot
weather
despite
being
a
little
darker
a
good
gateway
beer
for
people
trying
to
get
into
craft
beer
ffo
brooklyn
lager
sam
adams
lager
long
trail
ale
otter
creek
copper
ale
etc
abita
makes
some
delicious
brews
and
this
is
definitely
one
of
them
poured
a
nice
dark
amber
color
with
a
nice
head
that
lasted
a
few
minutes
smell
was
nice
and
clean
with
some
hints
of
hops
and
grains
first
taste
was
crisp
and
clean
i
really
noticed
the
grain
taste
in
this
beer
normally
im
not
a
grain
kind
of
guy
sometimes
reminds
me
of
crappy
beers
but
i
really
enjoy
it
in
this
beer
finish
was
also
full
of
grain
for
me
with
a
little
hop
and
a
hint
of
caramel
type
flavor
really
enjoyed
this
one
this
is
my
first
review
hope
i
did
this
beer
justice
i
like
this
beer
poured
with
a
nice
off
white
head
and
a
little
lace
color
is
a
clear
medium
amber
aroma
is
malty
caramel
toffee
and
a
bit
of
fruit
flavor
is
where
this
stands
out
not
outstanding
but
very
serviceable
lots
of
slightly
roasty
dryish
malt
with
a
bit
of
caramel
and
toffee
not
too
sweet
good
body
and
carbonation
finish
is
like
flavor
and
tapers
off
in
a
short
to
medium
lenght
easy
drinking
session
beer
overall
a
nice
light
marzen
with
a
supeusingly
dry
finish
a
very
good
amber
thats
pretty
much
like
a
very
tasty
version
of
a
bud
but
much
better
a
good
beer
session
beer
that
i
could
drink
all
night
very
pleased
with
this
beer
and
would
probably
go
for
it
again
its
pretty
light
and
i
would
personally
like
a
bit
more
body
but
it
is
very
drinkable
a
good
year
round
marzen
one
of
the
few
notes
honestly
i
was
hoping
for
an
amber
ale
as
i
popped
this
top
but
then
i
saw
that
it
is
classified
as
a
marzenoktoberfest
also
i
had
this
beer
a
bit
earlier
in
the
week
and
noted
some
metallic
offflavors
d
while
this
isnt
the
best
beer
out
there
its
a
good
session
beer
i
drank
a
number
of
these
while
grillin
with
some
friends
it
wont
blow
you
away
but
its
worth
a
try
d
very
inoffensive
middleoftheroad
brew
the
flagship
beer
of
abita
and
one
that
will
appeal
to
all
but
be
the
favorite
of
none
still
a
big
step
up
from
the
bmcs
can
generally
be
purchased
very
fresh
and
cheap
in
louisiana
its
okay
but
im
not
going
out
of
my
way
to
purchase
id
rather
get
something
more
interesting
d
well
this
beer
is
certainly
easy
to
drink
mostly
from
its
quite
subdued
flavor
still
its
certainly
refreshing
and
pleasant
to
imbibe
it
just
doesnt
pack
the
same
oktoberfest
feeling
as
other
more
developed
märzens
d
a
well
made
amber
ale
that
drinks
just
fine
boring
though
d
more
please
really
one
of
the
best
märzens
i
ever
had
and
more
affordable
than
the
others
as
well
it
pours
a
really
light
straw
yellow
color
with
some
foam
the
best
part
is
that
you
can
really
taste
the
spring
water
in
it
dnot
a
bad
beer
fairly
straighforward
i
would
drink
this
beer
again
if
had
limited
choices
d
a
very
drinkable
beer
nothing
outstanding
here
just
a
really
solid
brew
from
one
of
my
favorite
breweries
taste
is
really
crisp
and
smooth
with
a
nice
malty
backbone
and
some
light
noble
hops
really
tasty
beer
not
like
most
oktoberfest
but
very
tasty
a
good
session
brew
easy
to
drink
i
could
do
several
of
these
in
a
session
and
have
in
the
past
a
good
solid
offering
from
abita
and
an
excellent
gateway
beer
for
your
average
bmc
drinker
d
could
be
a
bit
more
balanced
but
still
easy
to
drink
now
this
isnt
to
say
that
this
beer
is
bad
its
not
abita
is
a
damn
solid
brewer
and
wouldnt
release
crap
its
just
kinda
there
theres
some
fruitiness
in
the
aroma
and
flavor
a
teeny
weeny
bit
of
bready
beeriness
but
thats
it
its
not
bland
its
not
flavorful
it
just
is
this
beer
has
clear
reddish
brown
color
with
an
offwhite
head
which
did
not
setup
very
thick
the
beer
lacks
a
very
distinct
aroma
i
may
have
had
a
slightly
undercarbonated
bottle
which
could
explain
the
weak
head
and
lack
of
aroma
the
flavor
was
also
fairly
bland
with
a
forward
malty
sweetness
and
a
mild
hop
finish
the
beer
is
fairly
smooth
and
easy
to
drink
but
it
lacks
much
of
a
distinct
flavor
a
good
beer
worth
a
shot
more
often
than
just
when
new
orleans
is
doing
something
significant
overall
not
a
bad
representation
of
the
style
but
also
not
my
favorite
orange
amber
with
blonde
highlights
and
a
pillowy
eggshell
head
of
foam
that
melts
slowly
forming
soft
peaks
toasted
caramel
and
chocolate
with
a
touch
of
something
off
like
dishwater
maybe
i
cant
put
my
finger
on
it
this
beer
tastes
better
than
it
smells
for
sure
toasted
pale
malt
and
caramel
with
mild
minty
hop
notes
medium
light
bodied
with
seltzery
carbonation
an
average
to
above
average
domestic
oktoberfest
not
bad
beer
but
fairly
ordinary
this
is
a
unique
amber
brew
that
being
said
i
have
to
admit
it
is
also
one
of
the
better
ambers
ive
had
i
think
abita
has
a
solid
foundation
down
in
louisiana
especially
since
this
brew
seems
to
be
one
of
the
brewerys
staples
my
thanks
go
out
to
drizzam
for
sharing
very
drinkable
nice
brew
well
done
and
easy
to
drink
nothing
crazy
going

just

overall
its
kind
of

of

this
one
is
slightly

id
suggest
this
for
you
to
try

not
to
go
crazy
over
cheers
drinkability
not
a
terrible
beer
but
it
was
rather
forgettable
i

its

nifty
that
abita
chose

looses
points

its

if
its
a
marzen
it
needs
more
malt
if
its
an

it
needs

hops

in

places
in

nice
deep
amber
color
i
remember
that
this
was
the
only
beer
i
drank
while
in
new
orleans
and
i
had
it
on
draft
and
it
was
good
then
i
tried
it
again
in
the
bottle
back
in
atlanta
and
it
was
only
ok
its
got
a
nutty
flavor
that
kind
of
reminded
me
of
michelob
except
a
good
bit
better
its
also
a
bit
spicy
its
a
good
beer
for
the
price
solid
enough
to
hold
its
own
against
spicy
boiled
crawfish
maybe
this
is
rated
so
high
because
its
the
most
wellknown
craft
beer
but
its
just
not
my
style
theres
only
been
one
beer
that
ive
not
been
able
to
even
finish
half
of
and
this
isnt
it
but
i
will
definitely
never
drink
it
again
lovely
fruity
followed
by
a
mellow
malty
after
taste
wow
this
beer
smells
very
good
but
it
leaves
an
odd
flavour
in
the
aftertaste
didnt
like
that
ok
for
last
resort
crft
beer
great
beer
always
start
with
this
one
at
a
bar
it
was
a
very
blan
ipa
not
satisfied
stilla
very
good
amber
lager
i
dont
get
the
hype
with
the
beer
it
just
aint
that
good
and
ive
had
a
bunch
not
a
good
beer
at
all
overhyped
for
a
macrobrew
very
good
taste
distinctive
not
overbearing
great
beer
when
someone
says
do
you
want
to
get
a
beer
this
is
the
first
beer
i
think
of
great
smell
and
color
better
than
average
taste
a
classic
ok
slight
skunky
smell
still
a
decent
beer
boston
lager
is
a
solid
brew
to
introduce
a
novice
into
the
world
of
craft
brewing
its
approachable
and
crisp
a
smooth
lager
that
is
relatively
common
everywhere
i
often
pick
up
a
6pack
at
lower
stocked
store
that
mainly
carry
the
big
brands
this
is
a
pretty
good
beer
for
a
pretty
good
price
the
hops
have
a
very
prominent
appearance
in
its
flavor
but
also
there
is
a
malty
sweetness
to
it
as
well
that
makes
a
great
combination
forget
the
haters
sam
adams
is
my
go
to
sports
bar
beer
it
was
the
first
craft
you
could
even
get
and
still
hits
the
spot
this
is
a
great
lager
looks
and
smells
great
the
taste
doesnt
really
have
much
of
a
bite
but
it
still
has
good
malt
and
just
enough
hoppiness
very
smooth
and
enjoyable
a
classic
i
like
this
beer
and
look
forward
to
my
next
drink
i
enjoyed
the
crisp
and
overall
feel
first
craft
beer
ive
ever
boughtdrinken
and
it
did
not
disappoint
looks
good
smells
good
goes
down
smoothly
and
tastes
great
flavors
are
balanced
well
with
a
little
spice
and
fills
you
up
one
pint
left
me
completely
satisfied
definitely
my
goto
beer
now
its
a
decent
beer
not
bad
something
you
would
show
to
friends
who
are
looking
to
get
into
beers
im
not
such
a
fan
of
lagers
in
general
so
i
guess
its
no
surprise
that
i
didnt
like
this
so
much
i
was
kind
of
hoping
a
lager
from
a
craft
brewery
would
change
that
though
it
didnt
i
guess
i
just
have
to
give
up
on
this
style
altogether
excellent
lager
way
ahead
of
the
macros
very
good
flavor
with
crisp
clean
finish
overall
great
craft
having
incredible
rich
smooth
flavors
but
with
a
strange
nose
indeed
either
much
maligned
or
much
loved
sam
adams
is
a
solid
choice
when
you
want
a
beer
with
more
flavour
vienna
lagers
are
under
appreciated
and
this
beer
compares
favourably
it
has
a
nice
robust
malt
profile
a
bit
of
spice
and
bittering
hops
its
worth
periodic
revisits
because
it
is
widely
available
even
here
in
the
great
white
north
this
is
a
good
beer
very
complex
flavor
but
its
full
and
robust
not
a
bit
smooth
barely
better
than
bmc
terrible
great
look
not
big
on
lagers
but
this
is
a
winner

great

at

did
not
enjoy
this
beer
at
all
it
is
what

its

knock

beautiful

not

in

and
is
for
the
casual
drinker
looking
to
enjoy
a
few
beers
at
parties
you
can
drink
these
like
your
typical
party
beers
bud
coors
etc
but
enjoy
added
flavor
with
every
sip
ok
regular
bar
beer
enough
said
this
is
where
it
all
started
my
taste
palette
developed
so
much
still
a
great
lager
it
taste
like
beer
it
doesnt
have
the
watery
flavor
of
coors
or
bud
this
is
the
beer
that
popped
my
cherry
into
more
hop
forward
beers
im
a
sucker
for
ipas
now
but
this
is
still
a
solid
go
to
beer
you
cant
go
wrong
with
a
boston
lager
beautiful
look
lacing
smell
taste
mouthfeel
its
just
all
around
a
great
brew
if
you
are
someone
who
has
only
had
pilsners
and
other
american
adjacent
lagers
and
are
looking
to
step
up
in
the
beer
world
toward
the
hops
route
this
is
a
great
starter
and
solid
cession
brew
im
a
darker
beer
fan
but
i
like
this
beer
will
always
drink
over
domestics
if
its
on
tap
its
the
most
famous
but
not
their
best
on
draft
at
laguardia
the
other
day
id
rate
this
as
the
best
boston
lager
ive
had
i
think
it
has
evolved
it
is
less
aggressive
in
hop
character
less
astringent
very
good
classic
helles
flavors
which
you
notice
more
in
the
aftertaste
good
everyday
lager
with
lots
of
flavor
a
classic
outstanding
beer
that
is
available
on
a
budget
it
is
easy
to
locate
cheap
and
has
a
beautiful
look
to
it
when
poured
goes
down
easily
and
doesnt
fill
you
up
too
quickly
its
a
smooth
beer
that
can
be
drank
all
day
everyday
and
you
wont
get
sick
of
it
the
ba
score
tells
you
fun
beer
to
try
wish
it
was
more
bitter
i
wouldnt
wish
this
brew
upon
my
worst
enemy

combine
for
a
silky
creamy
palate
good
carbonation
balanced
dry
slightly

finish
its
hard
to
find

here
its
just
a
fine
basic
lager
that
is
thankfully
widely
available
a
standard
good
beer
i
enjoy
sam

great
beer
the
taste
is
smooth

rich
its
a
must
for
the
fall
season
its
samuel
adams
you
bet
its
good
of
all
the
widely
available
lagers
this
one
is
different
and
has
both
good
taste
and
mouthfeel
this
beer
is
so
over
looked
in
our
craft
mania
world
the
fact
that
this
beer
was
kochs
great
grandfathers
recipe
from
the
1800s
is
so
cool
and
remember
this
beer
along
with
bells
amber
ale
and
others
really
kicked
off
the
beer
revolution
we
know
today
so
take
a
step
back
and
try
a
six
pack
you
wont
be
disappointed
this
is
in
my
top
5
of
favorites
great
taste
and
feel
overall
a
archetypal
beer
to
me
nothing
super
exciting
but
solid
middle
of
the
road
its
whatever
great
standard
beer
awesome

imho

great

some
hops
detected
on
the
finish
but
not
much
very
very
smooth
and
highly
sessionable
lots
of
flavor
to
enjoy
here
overall
this
brew
is
a
usual
for
me
would
recommend
everyone
to
try
one
of
the
best
lagers
the
best
everyday
lager
you
can
drink
never
understood
the
hype
for
the
price
this
beer
doesnt
taste
very
good
very
solid
one
of
the
best
lagers
around
always
a
tasty
option
good
looks
nice
balance
in
the

one
of
my
favorite
lager
style
beers
one
of
the
best
beers
ive
had
in
a
while
a
wonderful
session
beer
pleasure
to
drink
my
first
real
beer
still
so
enjoyable
is
always

i
can
always
count
on

option
in
an
average
bar
have
had
this
in

and
on

on
numerous
0ccasions
over

years
a
safe
choice
when
other
offerings
arent

always
solid
and
consistent
really
enjoyed
this
right
out
of

enjoy
the
malt
flavors
that
linger
just
right
i
can
see
why
it
is
a
go

10
times
over
balanced
with
a
lot
of
character
everything
you
wish
from
a
good
beer
way
overrated
this
is
not
a
good
beer
lager
whether
from
the
tap
or
bottle
it
always
has
a
hint
of
vinegar
smell
and
taste
not
worth
the
premium
charge
pioneer
of
craft
definately
surpassed
in
that
field
but
thanks
for
getting
the
taste
of
crack
and
hooker
spit
out
of
my
mouth
at
9
am
that
one
wednesday
you
totally
saved
my
job
and
marriage
i
will
take
this
over
a
macro
brew
any
day
the
beer
pours
a
bright
tangerine
color
with
lively
carbonation
that
sends
bubbles
streaming
to
the
surface
this
one
could
grace
a
beer
commercial
perfect
thick
white
head
that
falls
gradually
with
lacing
all
the
way
to
the
rim
impressive
fruity
esters
and
a
buttery
malt
aroma
in
the
nose
a
little
bit
of
citrus
and
spice
from
the
hops
the
flavor
is
malty
complex
and
delicious
i
think
we
beer
advocates
forget
just
how
good
this
beer
truly
is
theres
just
a
touch
of
caramel
sweetness
with
cereal
grain
and
a
wellbalanced
bitterness
in
the
finish
hints
of
orange
peel
spice
and
some
toffee
on
the
tongue
the
body
is
remarkably
fuller
than
one
might
expect
i
attribute
this
to
a
little
sleight
of
hand
with
the
aggressive
carbonation
the
prickly
suds
convey
a
creamy
mouthfeel
and
feign
fullness
with
masterful
precision
nice
clean
finish
that
begs
for
another
gulp
at
under
5
abv
this
is
a
powerhouse
of
flavor
and
texture
i
cannot
think
of
a
single
small
lager
that
packs
as
much
moxie
as
the
flagship
beer
from
boston
still
world
class
in
todays
glut
of
aspiring
craft
kings
dont
like
everything
sam
adams
puts
out
but
there
flagship
is
defiantly
done
right
you
have
to
think
about
what
style
you
are
drinking
this
beer
is
perfect
the
way
it
is
a
classic
go
to
beer
great
beer
for
everyday
good
beer
to
introduce
new
drinkers
to
craft
beer
boston
lager
from
sam
adams
is
a
great
example
of
how
all
good
beers
dont
need
to
be
microbrews
with
small
name
labels
sam
adams
really
does
put
some
great
care
into
their
brewing
and
definitely
stands
out
to
me
and
continues
to
even
after
trying
beers
such
as
heady
topper
and
other
micro
brews
with
very
high
ratings
thats
not
to
say
that
boston
lager
is
better
than
these
beers
but
it
definitely
holds
its
own
and
remains
relevant
in
todays
increasingly
diverse
micro
and
macrobrew
beer
market
o
i
respect
boston
lager
for
its
craft
and
its
place
but
this
is
not
my
goto
brew
clean
and
crisp
easily
drinkable
it
is
lightyears
ahead
of
the
boring
aals
that
dominate
the
industry
nevertheless
though
i
think
this
is
an
expertly
crafted
brew
i
find
its
elements
and
the
overall
drinking
experience
somewhat
lackluster
and
for
the
style
there
are
examples
elsewhere
that
i
find
more
compelling
medium
bodied
medium
low
carbonation
still
one
of
the
best
american
made
beers
to
sum
it
up
in
my
honest
opinion
it
is
everything
a
beer
should
be
refreshing
delicious
and
timeless
the
gold
standard
of
all
easydrinking

lookreddish

taste
heavy
malty
taste
upfront
with
a

feel
very

with

overall
a
solid
crossover
beer
that
meets
all
the
specifications
of
a
vienna
lager
always
a
solid
lager
smooth
and
favorful
my
go
to
when
options
are
limited
solid
beer
not
the
best
not
the
worst
a
unique
taste
combined
with
smooth
finish
my
go
to
beer
a
real
treat
nice
an
hearty
the
perfect
beer
to
go
with
strong
flavors
didnt
mind
this
brew
at
all
boston
lager
is
one
of
my
least
favorite
sam
adams
brews
and
im
not
sure
if
its
because
i
know
how
much
variety
they
have
elsewhere
or
if
i
just
dont
like
it
that
much
but
its
one
i
typically
pass
up
on
a
menu
unless
theres
nothing
else
worth
drinking
out
of
a
bottle
this
is
some
of
the
best
dark
lager
ive
ever
had
out
of
a
can
its
too
carbonated
good
beer
bought
a
can
for
1
00
recently
some
good
stuff
bought
in
a
quest
to
find
the
best
beer
at
my
gas
station
between
this
lager
and
sierra
nevadas
pale
ale
we
have
a
lager
winner
and
a
ale
winner
blue
moon
belgian
white
is
better
than
the
shock
top
equivalent
over
all
good
buy
and
an
excellent
buy
for
the
money
enjoyable
and
just
easy
drinking
lager
this
is
something
i
would
keep
around
beats
anything
else
besides
the
sierra
nevada
over
all
a
5
out
of
5
excellent
quality
at
a
low
price
after
all
sa
started
the
craft
revolution
considering
this
is
my
first
craft
style
lager
its
better
than
all
the
bud
miller
and
coors
lagers
this
is
my
go
to
beer
when
there
arent
any
craft
beers
to
try
its
better
than
many
craft
beers
and
most
all
mass
produced
beers
the
samuel
adams
taste
had
a
variety
of
strong
flavours
from
the
hops
and
malt
which
were
well
balanced
all
tingling
away
at
my
taste
buds
caramel
was
one
taste
that
stood
out
the
finish
is
strong
with
a
long
lasting
heavy
aftertaste
overall
a
nice
solid
beer
and
a
great
delicious
taste
samuel
adams
is
a
beer
that
you
will
remember
readily
available
commercial
craft
and
after
all
the
years
its
still
a
consistent
recipe
always
stocked
in
my
fridge
never
let
down
with
this
one
4050
overall
this
beer
has
grown
on
me
as
of
late
for
years
i
didnt
really
care
for
it
but
i
have
found
it
more
enjoyable
in
recent
months
you
know
i
dont
really
care
if
people
diss
sam
adams
or
not
i
think
several
of
there
beers
are
pretty
damn
good
this
one
imo
is
there
best
granted
they
do
have
some
pretty
horrid
offerings
see
latitude
48
but
several
are
superb
boston
lager
is
a
very
well
balanced
beer
with
exceptional
drinkability
also
give
them
credit
for
saving
from
near
extinction
one
of
the
greatest
beer
styles
the
vienna
lager
if
you
havent
tried
a
boston
lager
yet
do
yourself
a
favor
and
give
it
a
shot
chances
are
you
will
like
it
great
go
to
beer
as
its
available
almost
everywhere
would
like
to
try
it
on
draft
at
some
point
i
thought
it
tasted
like
i
was
sipping
some
sweaty
locker
room
socks
that
had
been
boiling
in
urine
for
a
good
hour
not
a
fan
overall
sam
adams
is
well
sam
adams
its
not
the
most
flavorful
beer
in
the
world
but
it
generally
beats
out
most
other
cheap
aals
it
used
to
be
my
goto
before
i
wised
up
but
it
still
gets
the
job
done
and
i
wouldnt
turn
one
down
if
it
was
offered
to
me
this
is
an
amazing
example
of
a
lager
style
beer
clean
crisp
and
refreshing
pours
a
beautiful
amber
color
with
a
thin
maybe
14
white
head
the
smell
is
light
a
subtle
dry
hop
smell
to
it
perhaps
very
easy
drinking
tastes
of
a
nice
light
hops
flavor
mixed
with
a
light
citrusy
flavor
this
is
very
easy
drinking
and
has
a
great
traditional
clean
lager
taste
i
especially
enjoy
the
lightly
dry
finish
to
the
sip
if
your
looking
for
something
that
is
quality
and
easy
drinking
for
a
simple
night
this
is
it
real
boring
plain
old
lager
not
great
by
any
stretch
also
not
horrible
either
just
plain
jane
and
mass
produced
pretty
much
exactly
what
you
would
expect
still
holds
it
own
after
all
these
years
so
much
flavor
and
perfectly
balanced
so
easy
to
drink
the
first
shot
across
the
bow
of
the
mega
brewers
and
it
still
works
25
years
later
pretty
good
deep
golden
c
olour
with
a
rich
creamy
head
that
never
seems
to
vanish
lots
of
lace
smell
is
floral
hoppy
not
surewhich
hop
is
used
but
smells
a
bil
like
marijuana
ok
ive
seen
noble
hops
in
another
review
caramel
and
grains
silky
creamy
palate
good
carbonation
taste
of
caramels
malty
grains
hoppy
bitter
finish
the
tart
and
bitter
aspects
are
fairly
intense
and
perhaps
slightly
out
of
balance
with
the
remaining
flavors
which
are
otherwise
rich
and
expressive
along
with
the
smooth
texture
the
overall
effect
is
that
of
an
easily
drinkable
and
satisfying
beer
sam
adams
boston
lager
in
my
eyes
this
is
the
beer
that
kicked
off
the
craft
and
homebrew
revolution
in
the
us
a
must
have
at
all
events
whether
its
the
backyard
bbq
for
the
4th
of
july
or
with
thanksgiving
turkey
or
while
watching
the
superbowl
in
the
dead
of
winter
it
must
be
stocked
and
available
at
all
times
truly
amazing
taste
i
wish
in
canada
we
had
all
sams
beers
very
solid
consistent
beer
it
is
available
almost
anywhere
you
go
and
provides
a
good
option
for
a
tasty
beer
11
one
of
the
beers
that
got
me
into
beers
easy
to
find
and
drink
the
most
contested
beer
in
the
industry
is
it
good
or
bad
your
decide
its
easy
to
knock
because
you
can
find
it
everywhere
but
its
still
pretty
good
o
its
a
nice
solid
lager
thats
affordable
very
available
and
approachable
beats
the
hell
out
of
a
bud
light
its
silly
to
turn
your
nose
up
at
this
the
lower
alcohol
makes
it
very
sessionable
just
a
great
lager
o
a
lot
better
than
i
was
expecting
and
i
am
really
pleased
that
this
us
best
seller
is
miles
better
than
the
shitty
guinness
contract
brew
you
can
buy
in
supermarkets
in
the
uk
i
had
this
one
and
sa
octoberfest
tonight
and
liked
them
both
will
definitely
make
an
effort
to
get
hold
of
some
more
usbrewed
sa
beers
now
glass
samuel

perfect

my
goto

round

perfect
mix
of

and
malt
part
of
variety

malty

with
a
dry
corn
taste
golden
brown
pour
not
a
big

1
finger
of
head
watery
taste
this
is
my
favorite
beer
o
really
very
good
for
a
lager
this
one
tastes
and
drinks
very
like
an
ale
it
is
smooth
and
goes
down
very
easy
like
a
lager
should
but
it
has
some
interesting
flavour
which
for
me
sets
it
apart
from
a
lot
of
others
this
one
is
a
good
session
beer
while
it
is
not
massive
in
flavour
it
is
more
interesting
than
i
was
expecting
and
i
would
definitely
order
this
again
my
personal
goto
just
like
the
label
says
balanced
if
i
had
to
buy
one
type
of
beer
forever
assuming
funds
were
no
object
this
would
probably
be
it
best
not
to
imagine
such
a
scenario
however
the
classic
the
mainstay
the
one
everyone
knows
better
than
all
the
bigmarket
beers
and
a
good
introduction
to
craft
brewing
sam
adams
is
getting
almost
too
big
to
be
really
classified
as
a
craft
brewery
but
nonetheless
they
do
make
some
good
stuff
and
this
is
the
one
you
can
get
everywhere
overall
good
beer
back
to
the
concert
very
good
hoppy
beer
thats
not
an
ipa
not
a
wow
beer
but
its
a
fine
beer
nonetheless
you
get
malts
and
a
nice
hop
presence
without
it
being
too
bitter
i
wouldnt
say
its
a
gateway
to
better
beers
but
some
would
its
cheap
enough
in
everyones
neck
of
the
woods
get
some
to
those
who
dont
yet
know
the
greatness
and
variety
of
the
lager
family
i
say
start
them
off
with
a
sam
adams
boston
lager
and
set
the
record
straight
it
is
a
great
transition
beer
or
starter
beer
for
those
used
only
to
the
super
mass
produced
stuff
and
isnt
too
bold
or
daring
to
intimidate
most
the
beer
itself
is
a
shiny
amber
with
a
fizzy
head
that
really
sticks
to
the
sides
of
your
glass
its
a
pleasant
yet
mild
caramel
aroma
and
tastes
similarly
of
sweet
malts
and
caramel
with
a
solid
finish
good
with
or
without
food
and
not
too
strong
or
weak
for
sit
down
to
a
single
bottle
or
a
few
versatility
is
yet
another
one
of
its
many
finer
points
o
nice
complexity
of
flavors
especially
for
a
lager
bitterness
is
balanced
by
some
sweetness
and
spiciness
very
enjoyable
and
drinkable
3
755
bawston
bottle
poured
into
a
sam
adams
pint
glass
looks
like
a
perfect
beer
with
an
opaque
hazelnut
color
smell
is
very
faint
but
is
overall
not
offensive
the
taste
was
much
stronger
than
i
was
expecting
so
much
so
that
it
was
offputting
consisted
of
hops
on
a
smoky
wood
background
the
finish
was
very
bitter
and
gives
it
a
lower
drink
ability
score
than
most
beers
in
this
category
for
what
this
is
its
a
decent
beer
but
for
the
hyped
up
price
there
are
better
cheaper
options
that
will
provide
the
drinker
with
a
more
desirable
experience
i
had
one
last
night
for
the
first
time
in
a
long
time
i
must
say
i
need
to
start
buying
this
on
a
more
regular
basis
nice
bull
bodied
beer
with
complex
flavors
without
being
over
the
top
drinks
smooth
and
finished
cleanly
with
no
bitter
aftertaste
slightly
hoppy
and
well
balanced
malty
flavor
a
good
stepping
stone
for
those
entering
the
craft
market
overall
beautiful
wellrounded
smooth
beer
perfect
beer
to
start
drinking
to
get
into
craft
beer
o
2
25
it
seems
hard
to
believe
but
i
was
disappointed
and
i
had
pretty
low
expectations
i
have
had
sam
adams
boston
lager
before
but
never
reviewed
it
critically
it
has
no
appreciable
nose
the
taste
is
not
something
that
i
like
and
the
body
was
unimpressive
overall
this
is
not
a
beer
i
would
ever
seek
out
even
on
a
hot
day
id
skip
this
in
favor
of
water
i
guess
if
this
was
the
only
craft
beer
at
a
place
that
server
bmc
then
id
go
for
it
sturdy
cheers
standard
when
it
comes
to
a
smooth
lager
refreshing
tang
and
just
enough
alchohol
for
a
mild
attitude
enhancement
without
the
knockdown
of
more
alcoholic
beers
my
goto
brew
i
allow
myself
one
or
two
per
evening
pours
a
nice
amber
lager
color
1
finger
white
head
smells
like
wheat
and
sort
of
citrusy
absolutely
a
citrus
note
like
orange
on
bread
tastes
quite
similar
a
very
nice
balance
of
wheatbread
with
citrus
pretty
much
put
vienna
lagers
on
the
map
tons
of
malt
with
this
one
for
my
money
great
lakes
elliot
ness
for
the
same
price
point
is
world
class
to
this
above
average
fare
overall
this
is
a
good
lager
more
hoppy
than
most
lagers
im
not
a
huge
fan
of
the
lager
style
but
i
enjoy
them
on
occasion
pours
a
pretty
amber
in
color
with
a
good
12
finger
offwhite
foamy
head
some
spotty
lacing
is
seen
when
sipped
that
actually
leaves
some
rings
even
the
aroma
is
of
roasted
malts
for
the
most
part
the
taste
is
right
up
front
with
the
sweetness
of
the
roasted
malt
followed
by
a
very
slight
hoppy
finish
it
isnt
bad
actually
and
doesnt
linger
even
better
on
draught
overall
a
decent
beer
though
many
of
their
seasonal
beers
are
better
anyone
know
the
answer
to
this
great
beer
i
can
review
it
but
everyone
else
has
and
we
all
know
it
is
consistent
and
good
tasting
and
a
solid
go
to
if
you
dont
have
any
other
options
i
gotta
say
i
love
the
hoppy
taste
and
all
of
the
nice
flavor
of
this
beer
it
is
strong
tastes
sweet
and
very
delicious
fruity
hops
to
me
anyway
dominate
the
experience
in
the
taste
to
me
its
fruity
hops
and
i
get
a
malt
taste
unlike
coors
light
which
is
what
i
drink
all
the
time
it
has
a
taste
to
it
that
is
distinguishable
i
like
this
more
it
is
something
beer
geeks
could
appreciate
i
taste
the
hops
unlike
with
budweiser
or
the
aals
the
aals
taste
like
corn
and
barley
and
things
like
that
this
tastes
different
its
been
a
while
since
i
had
it
but
it
tastes
like
caramel
malts
with
hops
best
ive
had
besides
guinness
blue
moon
and
bourbon
stouts
this
is
a
very
good
beer
not
the
best
but
it
is
a
good
start
sure
you
can
hit
and
miss
with
the
craft
beer
offerings
out
there
but
sam
adams
is
a
known
quality
nice
color
smooth
hoppy
taste
and
a
good
finish
oh
and
the
alcohol
content
is
significant
i
was
told
by
many
people
that
this
is
the
rolls
royce
of
american
largers
maybe
the
hype
was
built
up
too
much
i
guess
it
is
well
put
together
beer
however
i
dont
think
i
will
be
having
it
again
my
opinion
of
this
brew
has
gotten
better
with
time
i
think
the
can
option
actually
results
in
more
flavor
jim
k
has
really
sold
me
on
this
one
great
rich
taste
color
head
truly
drinkable
and
enjoyable
so
much
character
and
like
jk
says
todays
bl
is
better
than
it
was
originally
super
experience
the
crowning
staple
of
the
sam
adams
company
o
you
know
it
youve
had
it
its
sweet
crisp
and
easy
to
drink
theres
nothing
off
in
here
but
of
course
its
your
basic
lager
that
being
said
you
can
drink
this
any
time
and
be
ok
overall
a
classic
american
lager
that
was
at
the
forefront
for
the
past
30
years
in
helping
the
craft
beer
movement
its
well
balanced
and
enjoyable
to
drink
a
good
beer
to
keep
on
hand
yearround
this
beer
was
not
all
that
bad
i
enjoyed
this
beer
i
liked
the
flavor
and
the
aroma
that
it
has
to
me
not
was
a
little
heavy
but
i
enjoyed
this
beer
their
was
head
to
this
beer
but
that
was
ok
i
know
that
i
enjoyed
this
beer
if
anyone
like
loger
beers
they
shpuld
try
this
beer
o
not
the
best
amber
but
the
quintessential
starting
point
a
classic
a
good
american
beer
right
here
marvelous
appearance
bold
golden
hue
love
at
first
pour
it
smells
great
outstanding
four
stars
yeasty
american
lager
smell
this
lager
beer
has
an
impressive
taste
much
more
going
on
here
with
a
impressionable
strong
mouthfeel
and
taste
it
lingers
in
your
mouth
as
a
reminder
that
this
is
not
your
typical
domestic
budweiseresque
lager
of
all
the
lighter
beers
or
lagers
i
have
tried
this
is
one
american
classic
i
can
always
depend
on
as
a
quality
go
to
brew
boston
lager
is
a
very
good
everyday
beer
it
pours
with
little
carbonation
and
a
thin
head
leaving
some
lacing
on
the
glass
the
flavor
is
of
onedimensional
hops
the
color
is
dark
gold
not
quite
amber
and
the
taste
is
crisp
and
refreshing
sam
is
a
really
good
macromicro
brew
a
larger
brewer
who
pretends
to
be
small
imagine
34
sierra
nevada
pale
ale
14
spring
water
you
have
a
sam
adams
easily
one
of
the
very
best
american
lagers
overall
one
of
my
favorite
beers
of
all
time
a
consistent
classic
balanced
and
flavorful
this
is
stranded
on
a
desert
island
beer
a
great
allrounder
as
good
as
the
first
one
i
had
many
years
ago
when
it
was
one
of
the
first
semimicro
offerings
ill
buy
a
case
next
time
around
but
again
the
aroma
is
just
stunning
enjoy
advise
it
to
all
who
dont
know
the
type
but
are
openminded
o
boston
beer
co
would
never
have
gotten
off
the
ground
if
boston
lager
was
a
bad
beer
this
vienna
lager
might
appeal
more
to
the
masses
looking
for
something
beyond
fizzy
yellow
swill
but
by
no
means
does
that
make
it
any
less
noteworthy
the
skill
it
takes
to
create
a
nicely
malty
and
balanced
brew
thats
a
bit
lighter
with
no
flaws
is
what
i
would
call
an
art
this
work
of
bottled
art
is
delicious
on
its
own
balancing
toasty
bready
malts
with
just
enough
bitterness
but
also
begs
to
be
paired
with
pub
fare
as
its
easy
going
and
extremely
drinkable
overall
a
nice
beer
this
beer
is
widely
available
and
is
very
economical
to
be
such
a
quality
choice
sam
adams
sucks
i
hate
all
their
stupid
beers
and
their
stupid
commercials
this
crap
aint
even
from
boston
i
do
like
that
some
people
consider
it
a
craft
beer
and
buy
into
their
dumb
reputation
i
used
to
live
in
boston
and
part
of
why
i
didnt
want
to
stay
was
because
this
beer
company
was
associated
with
it
i
do
like
harpoon
though
that
is
a
much
better
boston
beer
brand
sam
adams
can
suck
it
because
it
does
suck
it
sam
adams
is
my
second
favorite
beer
behind
yuengling
it
has
a
good
color
nice
mouthfeel
wonderful
smell
and
a
great
taste
quite
simply
one
of
the
best
american
beers
that
you
can
find
at
your
local
store
it
would
make
the
founding
fathers
and
mothers
very
proud
purchased
as
part
of
a
12
pack
at
the
hennessey
grocery
in
butte
montana
9
99
on
sale
cheap
something
almost
everyone
has
had
but
still
a
nice
beer
the
pour
was
dark
yellow
almost
orange
and
the
smell
was
a
lot
of
malt
and
a
bit
of
floral
hops
coming
through
the
taste
was
a
nice
amount
of
flavor
from
the
hops
and
malt
which
were
well
balanced
and
a
very
clean
finish
the
mouthfeel
was
nice
as
well
being
a
good
balance
my
biggest
problem
with
the
beer
is
that
even
though
it
does
all
the
things
a
good
beer
should
do
it
doesnt
stand
out
its
basic
but
basic
is
good
too
sometimes
a
standardsetting
lager
nothing
mindblowing
but
an
exemplar
of
how
good
a
simple
recipe
can
be
a
beautiful
clear
amber
with
a
solid
head
it
has
a
pronounced
sweet
caramel
smell
the
caramel
taste
comes
through
wonderfully
in
its
heavy
malt
profile
particularly
at
the
back
it
has
a
light
and
smooth
mouth
feel
that
just
may
possibly
be
under
carbonated
this
is
a
solid
beer
my
go
to
lager
overall
4
50
definitely
in
my
top
10
goto
lagers
incredible
beer
and
incredible
attributes
o
a
solid
flavorful
brew
with
a
good
price
point
one
of
the

this

a
classic
american
made
beer
up
there
in
the
pantheon
with
anchor
steam
and
sierra
nevada
pale
ale
as
one
of
the
greats
and
deserving
of
admiration
and
respect
we
must
always
remember
where
we
came
from
while
enjoying
the
glut
of
new
beers
being
released
every
day
if
were
to
king
a
beer
sa
boston
lager
would
be
very
high
on
my
list
the
taste
and
feel
is
near
perfection
compared
to
beer
of
equal
stature
is
common
being
a
lager
sa
doesnt
feel
like
a
heavy
beer
leaving
one
feeling
bloated
and
feeling
full
the
chilled
sa
boston
lager
is
as
smooth
as
a
beer
comes
not
sweet
but
not
bitter
either
not
leaving
a
bad
after
taste
nice
easy
drinking
and
good
with
any
meal
and
most
especially
available
everywhere
at
a
decent
price
point
this
is
my
goto
beer
considering
this
was
my
gateway
craft
beer
back
in
1985
when
their
six
packs
came
in
a
cardboard
box
it
seems
pretty
average
for
what
it
is
decent
flavor
very
drinkable
just
nothing
special
about
it
overall
a
great
beer
but
only
a
good
vienna
lager
i
would
prefer
a
elliot
ness
over
this
and
its
cheaper
with
higher
abv
sa
makes
decent
beer
however
the
abv
is
always
towards
the
low
side
and
for
10
bucks
a
sixer
i
would
like
more
abv
no
complaints
but
i
have
had
better
vienna
lagers
overall
there
isnt
much
to
say
about
this
that
hasnt
been
said
its
fairly
ubiquitous
meaning
that
it
saves
good
beer
drinkers
from
having
to
tolerate
crap
beer
in
places
that
otherwise
have
only
crap
beer
its
a
terrific
session
lager
and
has
justified
its
following
many
times
over
samuel
adams
boston
lager
brewed
by
boston
beer
company
this
brew
pours
out
a
dark
amber
color
with
a
small
white
head
looks
like
iced
tea
the
smell
is
rich
the
taste
is
bitter
you
can
taste
the
hops
samuel
adams
boston
lager
is
not
like
most
american
style
lagers
this
brew
is
much
more
bitter
there
is
not
much
else
to
say
about
this
brew
it
is
not
smooth
but
it
has
flavor
if
you
like
bitter
beer
then
this
one
is
for
you
not
my
type
of
brew
at
all
over
all
im
giving
this
brew
a
3
25
out
of
5
at
best
overall
i
give
this
brew
a
3
5
again
the
head
and
lacing
are
pretty
nice
it
smells
very
pleasant
although
the
sudden
bitterness
sort
of
jumped
out
at
me
with
that
said
i
may
buy
this
brew
again
for
a
higher
scale

our

o
i
like
this
lager
very

it
brings
a

more
to
the
table
than
the
typical
vienna
lager
i
like
the
expressive
yet
not
overwhelming
use
of
hops
its
right
down
the
middle
for
style
and
is
a
benchmark
session
beer
aside
from
the
metallic
character
theres
more
depth
of
flavor
than
i
recall
the
finish
is
more
bitter
as
well
to
the
guys
and
gals
at
the
boston
beer
co
keep
up
the
good
work
semper
fi
oi
think
this
beer
deserves
some
props
for
the
history
and
the
taste
they
make
good
beer
plain
and
simple
i
also
give
them
a
lot
of
respect
for
naming
their
beer
after
sam
adams
who
was
a
crafter
of
beer
as
was
his
father
cheer
to
guys
and
gals
and
boston
brewing
company
o
i
have
had
this
beer
many
times
before
and
i
will
have
it
again
this
is
true
primarily
because
it
is
the
only
drinkable
beer
i
encounter
at
restaurants
that
do
not
carry
a
wide
variety
of
brews
its
not
my
favorite
but
it
is
not
my
least
favorite
very
nice
beer
this
is
a
great
american
lager
made
by
the
brewer
and
patriots
over
at
samuel
adams
i
feel
like
sam
adams
is
being
slightly
down
graded
from
craft
brew
to
mass
produced
near
beer
and
i
get
it
but
they
do
tend
to
make
some
nice
classics
such
as
this
beer
here
enjoyable
crisp
lager
very
sessionable
and
has
a
decent
complexity
with
the
hop
characters
all
around
a
very
well
performed
american
lager
perfect
for
watching
the
game
or
the
summer
picnic
overall
this
beer
is
very
drinkable
the
flavors
are
well
balanced
and
it
leaves
a
taste
in
your
mouth
that
instantly
makes
you
want
another
sip
my
perfect
go
to
session
beer
its
the
beer
that
got
me
and
many
others
into
quality
craft
beer
say
what
you
want
about
sam
adams
micro
or
macro
status
but
you
cant
doubt
that
this
is
one
beautifully
balanced
gateway
beer
especially
when
its
fresh
cheers
overall
trying
to
be
objective
since
ive
had
this
staple
lager
many
times
its
good
but
not
necessarily
great
long
ago
i
used
to
think
it
was
too
bitter
but
when
my
taste
buds
woke
up
i
realized
the
bitterness
is
just
right
with
the
overall
caramel
flavors
mixed
with
the
right
amount
of
hops
having
this
on
tap
is
the
best
way
to
have
this
but
in
a
bottle
works
just
fine
i
originally
rated
this
a
3
41
but
as
i
drank
it
the
caramel
and
citrus
flavor
wore
on
me
and
i
do
not
believe
it
belongs
in
the
lager
so
i
took
the
score
down
this
beer
pours
a
light
amber
color
with
a
half
nice
white
head
it
had
a
sweet
caramel
smell
with
hits
of
citrus
and
hops
the
flavor
is
sweet
and
slightly
citrusy
with
the
slight
bitter
after
taste
that
comes
with
a
lager
great
beer
from
a
great
brewing
company
overall
a
nice
and
sessionable
vienna
lager
by
samuel
adams
excellent
toasted
malt
and
leafy
hop
balance
beautiful
appearance
with
good
head
retention
o
good
flavorful
classic
craft
beer
easy
to
drink
good
price
always
available
this
is
a
very
good
beer
overall
this
one
is
an
old
standby
that
is
readily
found
at
most
restaurants
sure
its
not
the
most
craft
beer
experience
but
hats
off
the
sam
adams
for
at
least
getting
people
to
try
this
i
first
tried
this
beer
in
1990
at
a
restaurant
and
have
not
tried
it
since
at
that
time
i
thought
that
this
was
the
best
beer
i
had
ever
had
it
was
the
perfect
domestic
beer
for
me
everything
is
smooth
tastes
great
and
had
that
certain
it
about
it
tried
it
again
for
the
first
time
in
23
years
and
although
not
as
great
as
when
i
first
tried
it
it
was
good
nonetheless
nice
full
flavor
and
great
body
very
satisfying
and
highly
recommended
ooh
a
beautiful
finger
of
a
cap
of
eggshellwhite
head
with
lots
of
exploding
co2
bubbles
color
was
a
deep
copper
with
nequality
clarity
nose
was
grassy
noblehop
like
in
its
intensity
my
mouth
was
watering
in
anticipation
mouthfeel
was
full
almost
downright
creamy
in
its
fullness
i
can
only
hope
that
jim
koch
deigns
to
begin
putting
some
of
his
beers
in
a
can
lots
of
grassy
hops
on
the
tongue
making
me
think
of
the
gasthaus
waldesruh
in
cabaret
the
biergarten
where
they
spent
a
pleasant
afternoon
until
the
hitler
youth
began
his
song
they
were
putting
away
a
good
bit
of
lager
bier
along
with
brats
and
pretzels
say
its
time
for
a
midafternoon
snack
and
brats
and
pretzels
would
be
most
excellent
with
this
beer
finish
was
clean
hoppy
a
very
satisfying
beer
1
why
jam
it
into
the
winter
sampler
box
and
2
why
cant
it
come
in
a
can
so
that
i
can
take
it
to
the
beach
or
school
in
my
imaginary
cooler
that
i
imagine
every
day
in
that
classroom
this
beer
is
the
best
beer
you
can
get
for
your
money
the
best
bang
for
your
buck
poured
into
a
regular
glass
mug
clear
yet
deep
amber
color
foamy
tall
head
and
strong
body
a
burst
of
flavors
great
for
having
with
any
type
of
food
including
carmel
malt
hint
a
large
diversity
of
grains
including
wheat
and
barley
tastes
of
yeast
that
makes
it
seem
like
waterbread
almost
and
even
a
hint
of
some
citrus
that
might
just
be
me
a
little
watery
however
somewhat
hoppy
at
the
end
but
not
as
much
as
others
say
overall
this
beer
is
the
gateway
craft
beer
it
has
excellent
balance
and
flavor
o
this
ones
not
for
me
its
something
ive
had
many
many
times
and
likely
will
end
up
having
it
many
more
as
its
often
the
only
thing
available
at
certain
places
but
i
just
really
dont
like
the
flavor
profile
im
actually
a
guy
who
likes
sam
adams
offerings
probably
more
than
the
average
ba
but
this
one
in
particular
is
not
for
me
o
a
decent
beer
as
an
alternative
to
some
bmc
that
youd
find
at
most
restaurants
reminded
my
very
much
of
yuengling
amber
but
with
a
bit
bigger
flavor
and
body
im
happy
living
in
kalamazoo
because
most
restaurants
have
some
bells
usually
two
hearted
and
occasionally
founders
on
tap
and
will
always
be
able
to
go
with
that
over
boston
lager
or
blue
moon
smell
taste
aromas
and
color
are
beautiful
i
find
myself
drinking
this
beer
more
often
samuel
adams
is
a
true
pioneer
when
it
comes
to
beers
boston
lager
is
refreshingsmooth
and
a
great
first
beer
for
beginners
who
want
that
ultimate
bold
and
satisfying
clean
finish
overall
its
good
but
ok
at
the
same
time
i
dont
mind
drinking
it
when
i
buy
the
seasonal
packs
best
american
big
brewing
company
lager
imo
i
could
drink
it
anytime
any
place
and
commonly
do
you
are
going
to
find
better
craft
beers
no
doubt
but
that
isnt
what
this
beer
claims
to
be
i
didnt
rate
it
as
such
prost
boston
lager
is
definitely
a
must
try
pours
a
light
brown
color
with
two
fingers
of
tight
white
bubbles
that
retain
well
the
nose
though
hard
to
detect
even
in
my
relatively
warm
beer
has
bready
yeast
notes
sweet
grainy
malts
and
floral
hops
on
the
way
down
its
all
sweet
malts
with
a
hint
of
caramel
and
a
nutty
backbone
it
tastes
refreshing
with
a
creamy
mouthfeel
and
clean
finish
that
leaves
just
a
little
bitterness
o
this
is
a
full
blown
real
beer
with
no
thought
to
anything
but
a
full
flavoredmalts
and
hops
lager
its
fully
hopped
and
malted
with
crystal
malts
for
a
nice
amber
color
this
is
a
mans
beer
and
might
not
be
a
session
type
lager
because
it
so
full
bodied
and
good
beer
the
way
it
used
to
be
i
think
tm
the
toasty
grainy
notes
hop
to
the
front
of
the
palate
quickly
followed
by
a
caramel
note
and
a
hint
of
lemon
zest
chewy
texture
given
the
style
and
abv
with
plenty
of
scrubbing
bubbles
keeping
things
fresh
finishes
short
and
balanced
with
little
lingering
residue
overall
a
go
to
beer
that
you
know
wont
fail
cant
go
wrong
and
would
never
turn
one
down
overall
not
bad
for
a
non
dark
i
suppose
but
im
not
a
lager
fan
in
general
i
just
tried
it
because
they
had
it
a
party
but
this
is
not
something
id
buy
myself
yup
this
is
perhaps
their
best
beer
aside
from
their
ipa
im
not
sure
about
their
100s
of
flavors
this
is
a
great
lager
this
is
one
of
those
beers
you
can
drink
while
waiting
for
your
plane
to
arrive
and
know
it
want
be
bad
it
wont
be
great
but
it
will
be
ok
good
enough
in
fact
you
might
be
thankful
they
have
it
compared
to
the
other
options
i
am
drinking
this
on
e
in
seattle
waiting
for
the
government
to
go
back
to
work
a
light
russet
brew
with
a
classic
vienna
lager
look
the
color
is
somewhere
between
sunset
orange
and
reddish
with
understated
offwhite
head
aroma
brings
a
malty
sweetness
some
sweet
fruity
notes
almost
akin
to
grape
floral
hops
a
hint
of
spice
palate
is
impressive
there
is
a
downplayed
hazelnut
richness
a
dry
but
somewhat
fruity
bitterness
like
watermelon
rind
a
sour
note
that
just
barely
hints
at
citrus
and
the
expected
toasty
malts
although
each
individual
component
is
subdued
it
all
adds
up
to
a
malt
forward
flavorful
and
wellcrafted
offering
that
deserves
the
sometimes
grudging
respect
of
craft
snobs
like
myself
a
lot
better
than
many
import
lagers
and
also
widely
available
you
have
to
try
sam
adams
if
you
call
yourself
a
lager
fan
and
youll
be
appreciative
to
boot
has
a
strong
tastes
of
grains
very
smooth
not
too
full
in
the
mouth
the
there
is
little
aftertaste
it
finishes
smoothly
its
a
well
rounded
quality
beer
it
only
lacks
on
the
potency
of
the
hops
and
the
fullness
in
the
mouth
i
would
highly
recommend
this
beer
i
believe
its
one
of
the
best
mass
produced
american
beers
overall
a
very
fine
lager
nice
medium
bitter
finish
dismal
aroma
aside
this
is
a
delicious
lager
insanely
easy
to
drink
a
fantanstic
session
beer
cheers
a
pretty
nice
flagship
beer
from
samuel
adams
relatively
nice
intro
to
the
vienna
lager
style
mouthfeel
medium
body
medium
carbonation
incredibly
dry
crisp
finish
golden
color
with
bubble
frothy
white
head
decent
laceing
aroma
is
sweet
bread
spicy
earthy
hops
taste
is
a
nice
medium
body
with
spicy
hops
from
start
to
finish
sweet
bread
with
a
hint
of
caramal
toasted
notes
this
is
got
to
be
damn
near
the
best
lager
made
in
america
and
i
dont
care
how
much
of
this
they
make
ill
keep
drinking
it
o
a
fairly
often
overlooked
beer
for
me
and
most
but
one
that
i
do
come
back
to
and
something
that
i
would
never
feel
bad
having
as
a
staple
in
my
fridge
solid
at
worst
it
definitely
deserves
respect
not
just
for
what
it
has
done
for
the
beer
revival
in
the
us
but
for
still
being
a
great
beer
o
once
again
this
lager
is
one
of
my
goto
beers
it
isnt
the
best
beer
ive
ever
had
but
it
is
sure
to
satisfy
samuel
adams
boston
lager
is
an
outstanding
lager
with
lots
of
character
i
give
my
two
thumbs
up
to
this
one
this
beer
has
given
me
an
appreciation
of
master
craftsmen
who
count
their
successnot
by
the
number
of
barrels
produced
but
by
the
number
oh
happy
beer
drinkers
that
thirst
for
more
mr
koch
salute
and
thanks
for
being
a
passionate
human
being
overall
quite
flavorful
for
an
amber
lager
although
the
metallic
notes
certainly
didnt
win
this
one
any
points
the
color
was
oddly
light
for
the
style
and
was
also
surprising
considering
the
toastiness
of
the
malt
smell
and
taste
i
wouldnt
refuse
it
provided
that
the
metallic
character
isnt
present
in
every
bottle
i
highly
doubt
that
overall
for
a
lager
this
is
a
pretty
good
beer
great
for
just
relaxing
in
the
backyard
on
a
hot
summer
day
and
throwing
back
a
couple
cold
ones
with
your
friends
that
said
i
dont
really
drink
lagers
so
i
dont
really
have
anything
to
compare
with
im
partially
bias
towards
this
beer
because
almost
everyone
is
this
is
my
go
to
beer
its
a
staple
in
my
fridge
its
not
crafty
but
its
fullfilling
enough
to
be
a
quality
brew
the
color
is
great
the
flavor
is
good
for
the
style
this
is
the
entry
beer
into
craft
when
i
go
out
to
eat
to
at
a
chain
restaurant
and
this
is
the
best
beer
available
im
grateful
because
this
is
a
solid
beer
overall
a
3
60
and
i
will
not
decline
this
beer
ofor
what
it
is
sam
is
a
pretty
decent
beer
i
have
never
been
able
to
really
get
into
it
but
there
is
no
denying
that
it
has
some
appealing
qualities
that
other
brews
with
the
same
availability
do
not
possess
the
flavors
here
certainly
leave
a
mark
although
hop
heads
need
not
apply
is
there
a
difference
in
the
water
in
the
boston
area
compared
to
your
other
us
production
facilities
o
an
excellent
beer
i
remember
hating
this
beer
before
and
now
that
i
went
back
to
it
it
was
a
much
better
experience
perhaps
my
palate
wasnt
as
developed
before
its
a
solid
beer
that
goes
well
with
many
food
dishes
and
just
like
the
bottle
says
it
is
a
well
balanced
full
flavored
beer
this
is
always
my
beer
of
choice
when
it
comes
to
having
a
beer
that
i
want
to
drink
a
lot
or
with
a
friend
this
is
probably
one
of
the
most
inoffensive
beers
around
for
those
who
want
to
try
out
beers
outside
the
generic
bmc
this
is
a
sentimental
favorite
it
was
my
gateway
to
microbrew
sam
adams
is
a
full
bodied
malty
mouthful
it
is
luscious
i
taste
roasted
or
slightly
burnt
caramel
some
burnt
sugar
but
it
is
balanced
by
some
hop
bite
at
the
end
i
know
it
is
a
lager
but
it
tasted
like
no
lager
i
had
ever
had
at
the
time
that
was
1989
when
you
abandon
god
its
your
decision
and
yours
alone
i
have
enjoyed
sam
adams
beer
for
decades
but
no
more
o
a
decent
offering
that
can
be
found
at
lots
of
american
pubs
and
steakhouses
i
wish
i
could
get
some
more
easily
where
i
live
elegant
in
cleanliness
and
crispness
good
beer
overall
overall
great
beer
excellent
example
of
a
vienna
lager
and
a
beacon
of
light
in
many
a
dark
supermarket
beer
section
cant
go
wrong
with
this
at
one
point
this
was
my
favorite
beer
and
was
really
my
introduction
to
craft
beers
i
used
to
find
it
extremely
bold
compared
to
the
miller
light
that
i
would
usually
drink
the
flavor
seems
very
mild
and
unassuming
compared
to
more
assertive
style
of
beer
on
the
market
but
its
still
a
prime
example
of
a
dark
lager
done
right
i
have
always
liked
boston
lager
however
i
bought
some
recently
and
it
tasted
a
lot
like
a
beer
from
one
of
the
big
three
breweries
the
notches
were
not
marked
like
they
usually
are
and
the
beer
had
an
overall
mediocre
taste
not
old
just
reminiscent
of
a
cheap
corn
beer
it
was
a
shame
because
this
has
always
been
a
solid
lager
overall
not
a
bad
lager
frankly
i
think
it
looks
and
smells
better
than
it
tastes
but
it
is
still
better
than
many
lagers
out
there
the
taste
is
not
bad
but
it
is
just
kind
of
bland
and
onedimensional
i
want
a
lager
on
a
hot
summer
day
and
this
one
does
not
have
that
crisp
character
that
i
want
when
opting
for
the
style
o
very
well
balanced
and
distinct
beer
classic
sam
adams
malt
profile
that
is
evident
in
their
other
beers
including
their
latitude
48
ipa
good
balance
of
malt
hops
and
medium
bodied
carbonation
to
blend
all
the
flavors
together
palate
a
little
heavy
perhaps
if
your
used
to
it
personally
i
think
its
because
its
a
lager
if
only
they
had
made
it
an
ale
oh
well
its
still
one
of
my
favorites
and
my
common
beer
of
choice
for
your
standard
bar
o
this
is
a
lager
that
truly
is
different
one
of
those
few
that
thinks
its
an
ale
overall
excellent
daily
drinker
that
is
accessible
reasonably
priced
and
serves
as
an
excellent
starter
beer
for
trying
to
convert
friends
to
the
craftier
side
of
beer
o
great
choice
ill
be
buying
it
again
overall
pretty
good
if
not
slightly
better
than
pretty
good
actually
this
is
the
first
samuel
adams
boston
lager
that
ive
had
in
a
while
several
years
in
fact
and
i
have
to
say
that
its
much
better
than
i
remember
boston
lager
used
to
be
too
hoppy
for
me
but
the
hops
seems
to
have
mellowed
either
that
or
my
taste
budssensitivity
to
hops
must
have
developed
more
this
is
pretty
much
the
perfect
lager
it
may
not
get
the
credit
that
it
deserves
on
this
site
frankly
only
because
its
abv
doesnt
exceed
8
but
as
far
as
im
concerned
its
the
lager
with
which
all
other
lagers
should
be
compared
im
not
saying
that
means
it
is
necessarily
the
most
complex
beer
but
in
my
opinion
it
is
a
perfectly
balanced
beer
it
smells
fresh
each
time
just
because
its
easily
available
doesnt
mean
it
isnt
excellent
highly
overrated
overall
this
beer
still
is
pretty
good
i
must
have
had
it
100
times
before
finally
realizing
i
have
not
reviewed
it
it
still
is
a
solid
beer
especially
on
a
110
degree
day
4

this
is
a
great
beer
for
people
that
are
ready
to
step
up
from
the
bud
light
adjunct
world
but
arent
ready
for
the
adventurous
brews
of
most
craft
mainstays
nothing
offensive
but
nothing
to
extraordinary
either
overall
impression
great
easydrinking
flavorful
lager
that
could
be
happily
consumed
daily
or
in
session
toasted
bread
and
floral
tettnang
hop
flavor
dominate
to
bring
a
well
balanced
and
rounded
flavor
to
the
palate
ive
had
this
beer
many
times
and
have
been
very
pleased
with
it
every
time
the
taste
is
always
the
same
great
quality
control
the
color
is
very
nice
for
a
domestic
non
dark
lager
the
taste
is
very
refreshing
with
hints
of
citrus
hops
bread
and
i
always
get
a
little
grassy
like
after
taste
which
is
very
nice
the
carbonation
is
perfect
for
complimenting
the
after
taste
as
well
as
the
full
body
feel
it
has
while
drinking
this
is
for
sure
my
always
never
let
me
down
go
to
beer
boston
lager
is
a
nice
rounded
beer
that
goes
well
with
a
lot
of
food
pairings
or
with
drinking
it
solo
and
it
can
be
enjoyed
just
as
well
on
a
hot
day
or
a
cold
winter
night
boston
lager
is
close
to
my
heart
its
the
first
beer
that
really
made
me
appreciate
what
beer
can
be
certainly
there
are
other
better
beers
but
as
far
as
large
scale
brewing
goes
this
is
definitely
a
keeper
o
this
is
the
one
that
started
it
all
for
me
my
first
breakaway
from
aals
i
owe
quite
a
lot
to
this
one
and
even
though
i
can
safely
say
that
its
no
longer
one
of
my
favorites
its
still
something
that
i
can
enjoy
when
im
feeling
nostalgic
perfect
session
beer
outstanding
for
a
lager
light
flavorful
very
well
balanced
bbc
puts
out
a
lot
of
good
beers
and
doesnt
always
get
the
respect
it
deserves
in
the
craft
beer
world
oddly
however
and
unfortunately
their
iconic
flagship
beer
is
one
of
their
least
impressive
the
main
problem
is
that
it
is
just
a
little
too
bitter
for
the
style
i
like
an
aggressively
hopped
ipa
or
dipa
but
this
beer
enters
a
level
of
hoppiness
that
is
just
a
few
ibus
higher
than
it
should
be
for
what
it
is
and
leaves
me
with
an
unwelcome
and
unwanted
aftertaste
for
this
review
i
will
pour
a
little
into
a
taster
and
sip
the
rest
from
the
can
i
will
provide
a
side
by
side
comparison
of
the
two
drinking
experiences
except
when
it
comes
to
appearance
as
the
can
is
not
see
through
from
the
can
the
beer
pours
a
crystal
clear
amberorange
color
with
a
beautiful
head
of
creamy
medium
sized
bubbles
the
head
leaves
a
lacing
of
sticky
thin
lacing
that
leaves
spider
webs
on
the
glass
from
the
glass
the
beer
graces
the
nose
with
a
clean
crisp
fresh
cut
grassy
smell
with
a
light
biscuit
smell
wafting
beneath
the
grass
and
giving
a
warmth
to
the
nose
from
the
can
the
smell
is
slightly
intensified
to
provide
slight
citrusy
notes
with
the
grassy
hops
alongside
slight
hints
of
wet
dog
and
metallic
can
though
those
might
just
be
me
the
glass
has
the
better
smell
from
the
glass
the
beer
tastes
cleanly
bitter
with
a
warming
bready
sweetness
that
balances
out
the
beer
acids
are
very
light
in
the
mouth
only
providing
a
slight
wetting
to
the
tongue
from
the
can
the
beer
tastes
slightly
sweeter
mellowing
the
bitters
into
a
more
manageable
taste
in
flavor
from
the
glass
the
beer
begins
as
medicinal
bitters
but
quickly
blooms
into
wet
bitter
grass
with
a
warm
backed
biscuit
dough
and
a
touch
of
caramel
the
beer
finishes
grassy
bitter
with
a
touch
of
lemon
citrus
the
aftertaste
is
very
light
with
bitter
grass
from
the
can
the
taste
carries
some
slight
citric
lemon
from
the
start
mellowing
out
the
grassy
bitters
and
bringing
the
caramel
malt
more
onto
the
palate
doing
this
review
i
am
a
little
surprised
that
i
am
liking
the
can
more
than
the
glass
on
the
mouth
in
the
glass
the
beer
feels
on
the
heavy
side
of
light
with
a
heavier
carbonation
of
fluffy
bubbles
that
blanket
the
tongue
nicely
and
provide
a
slight
scrub
from
the
can
the
carbonation
scrubs
the
tongue
slightly
more
perhaps
due
to
the
smaller
hole
after
the
beer
leaves
the
mouth
is
left
slightly
damp
with
saliva
overall
this
beer
is
quite
similar
from
the
can
and
the
glass
which
is
surprising
since
i
have
had
several
of
the
cans
now
and
actually
thought
it
tasted
a
little
different
that
being
said
this
is
a
terrific
simple
lager
with
light
complexities
that
make
it
interesting
while
at
the
same
time
inviting
you
to
drink
more
and
more
boston
lager
is
nearly
sessionable
and
is
a
great
lawnmower
beer
in
my
mind
a
true
classic
remarks
did
not
score
a
t
s
m
at
that
time
disregard
those
scores
hardly
anyone
gets
into
craft
beer
without
enjoying
several
of
these
along
the
way
one
of
the
first
hoppedup
vienna
lagers
i
enjoyed
i
suppose
a
bit
more
malt
character
would
make
this
beer
match
the
style
description
a
bit
better
but
who
cares
lots
of
flavor
and
an
excellent
balance
make
this
a
true
american
classic
with
a
bank
shot
like
alex
english
i
get
distinguished
pours
amberhoney
color
with
thick
foamy
head
with
excellent
lacing
floralfruity
aroma
more
of
an
apple
aroma
malty
taste
up
front
followed
by
very
mild
hoppy
taste
with
an
apple
maltiness
on
the
end
aftertaste
is
more
fruity
good
beer
for
the
style
very
representative
o
mild
and
unobtrusive
good
gateway
beer
to
the
craft
world
decent
not
outstanding
widely
available
o
not
a
huge
fan
of
the
lager
style
overall
but
this
is
quite
the
flavorful
beer
for
its
abv
would
buy
again
for
the
purposes
of
this
review
had
this
poured
from
the
bottle
into
a
pint
glass
but
ive
probably
had
about
a
hundred
of
these
in
my
life
and
it
never
disappoints
one
of
the
best
coldbrewed
beers
around
the
color
is
an
amazing
copper
theres
a
nice
hoppiness
and
malt
balance
thats
very
good
very
nice
fullbodied
lager
its
quite
a
decent
beer
compared
to
the
american
adjunct
lagers
but
still
a
bit
lacking
for
me
i
finally
tried
the
much
anticipated
can
version
of
this
and
i
think
the
money
put
into
designing
this
can
could
have
been
put
to
better
use
the
mouth
itself
has
an
opening
about
14
from
the
lip
and
the
lip
itself
was
curled
out
away
from
the
can
and
the
mouth
was
a
little
wider
than
normal
cans
that
combined
with
the
distance
from
the
lip
you
need
to
tilt
your
head
back
further
to
drink
it
making
it
relatively
easy
to
spill
on
yourself
the
beer
did
not
slide
as
it
normally
does
for
me
i
will
be
sticking
to
bottles
in
the
future
i
have
to
admit
that
for
all
the
crap
that
people
throw
jim
kochs
way
his
boston
lager
is
pretty
good
and
is
better
now
that
its
been
canned
im
glad
that
i
decided
to
go
back
and
drink
the
beer
that
got
me
hooked
on
craft
beer
and
i
might
consider
to
start
picking
it
up
again
during
the
summer
because
of
its
taste
and
low
abv
not
to
mention
its
flexibility
with
food
pairings
o
this
is
one
of
sam
adams
best
known
beers
and
for
a
good
reason
one
of
the
best
wheat
beers
you
can
find
and
for
a
good
price
an
excellent
session
beer
great
for
any
season
recommended
this
beer
has
a
very
nice
color
to
it
and
a
very
nice
rich
head
that
stays
for
awhile
there
is
a
rich
and
creamy
taste
that
hits
the
tounge
all
at
once
and
stays
for
some
time
i
do
enjot
the
aroma
and
the
headyness
of
this
beer
i
could
enjoy
this
beer
with
a
nice
steak
or
grilled
salmon
america
used
to
make
strong
products
which
were
reliable
and
a
value
now
we
mostly
produce
crap
this
beer
is
a
prime
example
of
how
things
used
to
be
done
with
pride
it
harkens
me
back
to
when
american
goods
were
great
from
the
taste
to
the
smell
or
the
price
this
beer
must
make
the
brewers
proud
because
for
the
first
time
in
a
while
i
have
found
a
consistent
american
product
to
be
proud
of
way
to
go
samuel
adams
boston
lager
and
god
bless
america
food
match
everything
that
you
can
find
that
is
honeyglazed
ham
chicken
pork
chops
carrots
potatoes
pecans
and
pears
ground
to
a
fine
paste
on
toasted
bread
this
was
my
gateway
beer
before
trying
boston
lager
i
would
drink
only
lagers
a
notch
above
american
macro
adjuncts
like
stella
heinekin
kirin
sa
bl
introduced
me
to
the
pleasure
of
hops
while
retaining
the
crispy
mouthfeel
that
makes
lagers
so
drinkable
this
beer
has
a
much
stronger
and
more
interesting
malt
character
as
well
as
some
bitterness
from
hops
the
nice
amberish
color
and
thick
frothy
head
give
this
beer
a
great
appearance
especially
for
a
lager
this
is
such
a
good
lager
and
one
of
the
most
recognizable
it
has
a
nice
maple
and
caramel
taste
to
it
and
a
bit
more
bitterness
than
other
lagers
if
youre
in
the
market
for
a
good
standard
lager
look
here
i
will
get
this
again
o
my
first
experience
with
boston
lager
was
years
ago
before
id
become
accustomed
to
hopped
beers
and
i
didnt
like
it
well
tastes
change
and
after
downing
my
fair
share
of
pale
ales
and
trying
a
number
of
beers
i
decided
to
give
it
another
try
i
was
not
disappointed
the
hops
are
clearly
present
but
really
just
introduce
you
to
the
rest
of
the
beer
instead
of
overpowering
it
behind
that
the
mild
amount
of
malt
and
the
rest
of
the
flavors
come
through
cleanly
i
love
this
beer
its
no
wonder
this
beer
opened
people
up
to
craft
beer
o
ive
never
liked
this
beer
such
a
shame
since
i
was
born
in
boston
i
thought
now
that
i
knew
beer
better
things
might
be
different
but
theyre
not
overall
my
goto
beer
in
shitty
bars
really
this
is
an
excellent
beer
that
is
done
really
well
i
actually
enjoyed
this
one
better
from
the
bottle
maybe
due
to
dirty
tap
lines
or
perhaps
i
am
enjoying
the
greater
malt
presence
since
some
of
the
hops
may
have
faded
away
a
solid
beer
nonetheless
goes
down
relatively
crunchy
bubbly
i
think
id
better
stick
to
fresh
boston
lager
on
tap
a
beer
that
has
a
rightful
place
in
starting
the
move
to
craft
i
can
certainly
see
why
it
would
make
converts
of
macro
drinkers
the
malts
and
hops
come
through
to
give
this
beer
some
actual
taste
it
is
a
decent
drinking
lager
style
that
does
up
the
game
wont
be
my
favourite
beer
not
overly
complex
and
despite
the
good
balance
none
of
the
ingredients
really
makes
a
good
case
for
making
a
really
flavourful
beer
good
session
beer
tasty
and
not
a
beer
you
have
to
think
about
too
much
o
a
very
flavorful
balanced
and
drinkable
lager
this
is
definitely
a
nice
session
beer
and
pairs
well
with
steak
i
like
the
fact
that
its
available
at
almost
any
bar
or
restaurant
as
it
easily
beats
out
all
the
other
macro
lager
options
poured
from
12oz
bottle
it
settles
down
quickly
with
a
fine
fizzle
on
top
great
color
with
a
mild
maltalcohol
smell
taste
soft
noble
hops
upfrontsazz
or
hersbruker
maybe
good
filling
mouthfeel
4
star
beer
with
good
flavors
i
love
this
stuff
not
a
geek
beer
for
sure
but
you
wont
go
broke
with
this
one
available
everywhere
pours
a
nice
ambery
color
with
a
good
head
smell
is
just
a
nice
lager
smell
but
the
taste
while
clean
nice
lagery
has
a
certain
nuttiness
or
breadiness
that
i
really
enjoy
carbonation
mouthfeel
all
nice
while
im
not
a
huge
lager
guy
ive
had
enough
american
lagers
to
recognize
that
this
one
is
pretty
well
brewed
and
i
enjoy
the
unique
taste
it
has
i
think
there
are
some
reviewers
here
in
my
humble
opinion
who
forget
to
do
it
based
on
the
style
of
beer
if
you
hold
this
up
against
the
greatest
american
ales
of
the
day
its
not
going
to
do
well
but
for
what
it
is
this
is
good
beer
there
seem
to
be
many
people
like
myself
who
after
drinking
cheap
crappy
beer
in
college
realize
that
maybe
theres
something
better
out
there
and
try
a
better
beer
sam
adams
was
that
better
beer
i
tried
back
in
the
day
and
have
had
on
many
occasions
since
compared
to
miller
light
co
when
i
tried
sam
adams
this
beer
seemed
fantastic
but
after
trying
different
craft
beers
for
a
few
years
i
now
see
its
place
in
the
beer
hierarchy
and
its
a
good
aboveaverage
beer
this
is
what
a
good
normal
beer
is
supposed
to
taste
like
but
theres
nothing
particularly
special
about
it
that
makes
it
stand
out
overall
this
is
a
very
solid
allaround
beer
it
wont
amaze
but
it
is
really
easy
to
drink
and
retains
enough
character
to
remain
interesting
very
easy
to
find
and
affordable
too
an
obvious
choice
for
some
of
the
more
limited
restaurant
tap
selections
and
will
pair
decently
with
many
foods
just
a
very
enjoyable
classic
beer
i
would
call
this
beer
okay
its
a
good
okay
beer
if
youre
looking
for
something
to
drink
and
the
place
youre
at
doesnt
have
much
theyll
probably
have
this
and
while
it
wont
wow
you
itll
be
okay
im
very
glad
i
decided
to
try
this
beer
again
after
many
years
of
passing
it
by
on
the
store
shelfs
this
will
be
one
i
pick
up
more
often
poured
a
12
oz
bottle
into
a
sam
adams
glass
poured
a
a
nice
amber
with
a
big
creamy
head
that
lingers
around
and
leaves
nice
lacing
aroma
is
big
with
notes
of
fruit
raisin
maybe
caramel
and
little
bit
of
hops
taste
is
a
little
dialed
back
from
the
aroma
as
those
aroma
notes
are
present
but
more
blended
together
as
opposed
to
being
distinct
as
they
are
in
the
aroma
still
a
nice
flavor
to
it
with
a
very
slight
hop
bitterness
on
the
finish
fairly
carbonated
and
a
slightly
thinner
mouthfeel
a
good
craft
fallback
slight
hint
of
citrus
in
the
taste
along
with
the
hops
excellent
balance
of
taste
and
filling
great
flavor
without
it
feeling
like
i
just
ate
a
can
of
beans
probably
my
top
choice
for
a
12
pack
great
golden
amber
color
with
decent
head
sweet
hoppy
aroma
that
might
benefit
from
added
depth
and
complexity
but
definitely
pleasing
citrus
and
hoppy
notes
with
a
surprising
depth
that
you
might
not
expect
from
a
lager
slight
bitterness
that
adds
to
the
beer
balanced
mouthfeel
these
two
bottles
are
a
bit
more
bitter
than
usual
but
the
expiration
date
is
far
into
the
future
good
true
finish
o
i
like
this
beer
its
a
great
lager
i
love
lagers
this
one
has
flavor
o
above
average
lager
nothing
too
special
but
drinkable
and
easy
to
find
poured
into
a
seattle
beer
week
pint
glass
pours
a
medium
coppery
amber
with
a
nice
one
finger
offwhite
head
with
good
retention
and
lacing
aroma
of
biscuit
malt
grassy
hops
and
faint
light
fruit
flavor
follows
biscuit
malt
with
well
integrated
moderate
grassy
hops
a
hint
of
pear
and
apple
juice
nuttiness
nice
medium
body
with
light
creaminess
a
very
balanced
pleasant
to
drink
lager
nothing
really
stands
out
here
but
the
whole
lager
is
in
perfect
harmony
this
makes
it
clear
to
me
how
boston
beer
company
got
its
reputation
samuel
adams
boston
lager
45
old
reliable
the
gateway
beer
of
all
gateway
beers
a
kind
welcome
to
the
world
of
better
beer
smooth
simple
and
refined
an
unpretentious
lager
that
makes
for
an
excellent
nostalgic
session
beer
caramel
malts
and
sweetness
with
a
modest
hop
presence
crisp
refreshing
and
good
for
almost
any
situation
as
a
craft
beer
legend
samuel
adams
boston
lager
keeps
it
strong
smooth
and
simple
far
greater
than
american
standard
beers
straight
forward
craft
brew
the
best
thing
about
this
brew
we
can
get
it
almost
everywhere
on
tap
which
means
we
dont
have
to
settle
for
the
average
macrobrewed
american
beer
a
patriotic
beer
indeed
very
nice
amber
color
with
slight
head
depends
on
how
you
pour
i
pour
at
about
45
so
that
may
be
why
a
lot
of
beers
do
not
appear
to
have
a
lot
of
head
taste
is
slightly
hoppy
but
with
no
complaints
goes
well
with
bbq
the
pour
is
a
light
clear
amber
with
a
white
that
fades
fast
the
lacing
is
mediocre
while
the
head
remains
intact
the
aroma
is
very
pleasing
lots
of
spicy
hops
and
a
nice
strong
malty
backbone
the
mouthfeel
is
also
quite
nice
although
there
is
too
much
carbonation
the
mouthfeel
is
pretty
light
as
well
now
the
bad
up
front
it
tastes
of
stale
beer
off
malt
flavors
intertwine
with
hop
witternes
to
create
well
i
dont
know
that
dank
malty
flavor
never
goes
away
there
is
about
a
4
second
window
of
delectable
hops
but
then
it
fades
back
to
the
aforementioned
stale
malt
it
was
good
until
i
tasted
it
i
had
this
one
in
the
bottle
a
few
times
and
never
thought
much
of
it
aside
from
the
fact
that
it
was
an
easydrinker
and
quite
palatable
but
once
i
had
it
on
tap
i
was
hooked
this
one
opened
my
eyes
to
the
fact
that
a
lager
from
america
can
be
a
very
very
good
thing
it
pours
a
nice
light
orangered
with
a
golden
hue
thats
how
id
describe
a
vienna
lager
too
it
smells
of
fresh
earthy
floral
hops
and
a
touch
of
sweetness
nice
head
great
lacing
it
teams
well
with
the
sam
adams
pint
glass
it
was
poured
in
and
it
went
exceptionally
well
with
my
caesar
salad
and
sammy
i
had
a
couple
pints
of
this
solid
brew
that
day
and
have
since
proclaimed
this
to
be
the
best
american
lager
on
the
market
today
it
doesnt
try
too
hard
to
be
different
it
just
happens
that
it
is
brewed
with
all
malt
and
no
adjuncts
gee
big
boys
maybe
you
should
take
a
hint
that
even
the
least
educated
of
palates
can
tell
the
difference
between
your
toxic
slop
and
good
all
natural
and
real
beer

overall
this

nice

very
nice
flavor
balance
and
robustness
and
very
smooth
to
drink
a
very
enjoyable
offering
and
a
nice
option
that
is
available
anywhere
overall
this
a
beer
to
be
enjoyed
often
and
yearround
however
i
have
found
it
to
compliment
most
meals
quite
nicely
as
opposed
to
other
beers
that
really
shouldnt
be
drank
with
certain
meals
this
is
a
very
good
beer
and
i
can
see
how
it
helped
lead
them
to
the
success
they
have
today
i
dont
always
love
every
samuel
adams
i
try
but
i
do
respect
them
and
like
to
try
their
beers
still
even
with
all
of
the
cooler
craft
breweries
out
there
now
overall
ive
enjoyed
sam
adams
boston
lager
for
several
years
actually
sitting
down
and
analyzing
it
i
come
to
the
same
conclusion
as
i
also
have
had
this
is
a
good
beer
but
it
will
not
blow
you
away
with
a
groundbreaking
complex
taste
and
i
feel
that
is
how
this
beer
should
be
would
i
buy
this
beer
again
probably
not
o
im
pretty
happy
with
this
current
batch
of
the
boston
lager
i
have
to
try
it
fresh
on
draught
to
see
if
the
carbonation
issue
is
resolved
and
if
the
flavor
is
any
fresher
but
by
and
by
this
is
a
very
satisfying
brew
one
of
the
most
dependably
decent
beers
you
can
get
at
a
restaurant
and
a
beer
i
will
always
be
grateful
for
having
existed
easy
to
drink
a
bunch
but
also
nice
as
a
single
one
thing
though
wish
theyd
go
back
to
the
more
regal
look
they
had
on
their
bottles
a
few
years
ago
over
this
new
more
theatrical
look
good
ole
sam
adams
didnt
disappoint
i
really
like
this
beer
it
has
a
great
color
rich
and
golden
brownish
i
looks
like
what
i
think
all
beer
should
look
like
the
taste
is
full
but
not
over
powering
there
is
a
rich
bitterness
that
lingers
for
a
second
it
still
however
manages
to
maintain
a
smoothness
its
very
drinkable
it
is
no
wonder
why
samuel
adams
has
had
all
the
success
that
they
have
had
great
beer
that
i
surely
pick
up
again
my
first
experience
with
sam
adams
flagship
beer
was
back
in
berlin
germany
in
1987
or
maybe
1988
at
grunewoche
i
thought
it
was
pretty
neat
to
have
an
american
beer
accepted
for
this
big
fest
overseas
and
really
enjoyed
it
as
i
recall
as
the
years
have
progressed
ive
slipped
away
from
drinking
boston
lager
except
when
its
one
of
the
few
bottled
or
draft
beers
available
at
any
eating
establishments
my
wife
and
i
visit
there
are
just
too
many
other
new
beers
to
explore
these
days
a
good
problem
if
ever
there
was
one
but
back
to
this
review
this
is
still
an
excellent
lager
overall
its
nicely
balanced
and
is
a
mellow
yet
very
tasty
beer
you
cant
go
wrong
with
a
sam
adams
boston
lager
overall
this
is
actually
a
nice
lager
probably
the
best
mass
produced
lager
in
the
us
balance
about
sums
it
up
with
this
one
between
the
aroma
to
taste
to
body
everything
shines
through
and
nothing
is
overdone
o
a
good
vienna
lager
that
pairs
well
with
food
this
is
a
flavorful
lager
but
there
are
other
examples
that
have
really
impressed
me
oa
decent
flavor
profile
with
a
longer
bitter
finish
than
id
like
in
this
style
goes
well
with
a
spicy
dish
im
just
never
been
a
big
fan
of
this
one
o
the
brew
single
handedly
started
my
love
of
craft
brew
with
this
beer
i
realized
beer
is
not
supposed
to
be
tasteless
and
uninspired
and
that
there
was
so
much
more
out
there
to
be
tasted
this
is
a
great
session
and
i
have
no
problem
drinking
this
all
day
the
boston
beer
company
is
my
favorite
brewery
samuel
adams
boston
lager
is
my
favorite
beer
brewed
carefully
with
fine
ingredients
puts
this
companys
products
over
the
line
taste
is
malty
sweetness
bitter
coffee
aroma
is
coffee
sweet
and
bitter
overall
a
5
out
of
5
for
me
a
fabulous
beer
poured
from
a
12oz
bottle
with
a
surprisingly
light
orangeyred
color
and
a
finger
width
head
that
slowly
dissipates
when
on
draft
this
head
lingers
longer
the
smell
is
spicy
with
a
little
hint
of
sweet
boston
lager
maintains
a
malty
taste
that
is
quite
even
in
its
flavor
despite
the
variety
of
spices
and
caramel
that
excite
the
drinker
true
to
its
label
this
beer
really
is
rich
balanced
and
complex
as
a
student
in
boston
this
has
served
as
a
reliable
fallback
option
at
bars
and
restaurants
when
other
sam
adams
varieties
are
unavailable
as
mr
adams
most
popular
brew
this
lager
can
be
found
in
almost
every
seasonal
variety
pack
available
from
the
boston
brewing
company
and
its
popularity
is
certainly
well
deserved
o
this
is
a
great
brew
and
thankfully
its
usually
readily
available
at
establishments
with
limited
options
sam
adams
has
saved
me
many
times
from
having
to
drink
a
bmc
product
o
amongs
the
main
stream
sam
adams
has
always
risen
above
the
tasteless
and
uninspired
back
in
my
days
of
budweiser
coors
keystone
and
malt
liquor
40s
i
heard
sam
adams
had
over
20the
different
beers
and
i
grew
curious
i
grabbed
a
6
pack
of
this
beer
and
it
changed
everything
i
knew
about
beer
i
began
seeking
out
other
sam
adams
opening
me
up
to
a
world
of
different
styles
and
flavors
that
i
never
knew
existed
this
brew
is
an
awesome
session
and
i
owe
it
alot
overall
very
good
beer
by
sam
adams
smooth
drinking
overall
this
is
my
go
to
when
bars
have
a
crappy
draft
or
bottle
list
overall
hit
and
miss
sometimes
it
seems
watered
down
but
either
way
its
a
balanced
tasty
brew
thats
nearly
slammable
with
its
4
9
abv
overall
this
truly
is
a
special
beer
like
i
said
this
got
me
going
into
craft
beer
i
will
still
drink
sabl
anytime
anywhere
it
is
offered
if
i
cant
make
up
my
mind
as
to
what
exotic
ber
i
want
ill
say
forget
it
and
grab
this
generally
this
is
a
sidenote
purchase
at
the
beer
gettin
place
kind
of
a
counter
balance
so
if
all
the
exotic
beers
i
get
suck
at
least
i
got
a
sixer
of
sa
out
of
the
deal
exactly
what
a
beer
should
be
overall
i
drink
boston
lager
every
so
often
particularly
if
its
on
tap
i
used
to
think
lager
meant
fizzy
yellow
boring
beer
and
sam
adams
has
shown
me
different
if
you
live
under
a
rock
and
have
never
had
it
what
are
you
waiting
for
its
available
in
most
areas
of
the
united
states
and
at
a
fair
enough
price
overall
it
truly
is
a
special
beer
its
nice
to
know
its
there
after
ive
struck
out
with
other
beers
that
i
try
overall
3
5
better
than
average
beer
that
certainly
has
withstood
the
test
of
time
i
also
know
two
important
things
about
sammy
a
1
it
is
a
great
session
beer
and
2
it
does
not
go
well
with
some
foods
like
pizza
still
you
could
do
a
heck
of
a
lot
worse
than
this
brew
if
given
a
selection
of
us
domestics
one
of
the
most
beautiful
beers
ive
seen
it
pours
heavy
burnt
orange
with
hints
of
brown
and
gold
floating
off
the
considerably
thick
head
strong
pine
notes
from
the
noble
hops
are
followed
by
a
subtle
citrus
background
on
the
tongue
milder
that
the
strong
hop
scent
would
lead
you
to
suspect
a
slight
honey
sweetness
taking
the
edge
off
the
confident
hop
bite
and
a
quick
clean
finish
that
leaves
you
either
refreshed
or
disappointed
depending
on
your
mood
this
is
a
sold
beer
not
too
complex
but
hitting
all
the
basics
giving
a
great
baseline
with
which
to
judge
more
unique
beers
if
you
so
choose
to
experiment
or
just
a
palate
cleanser
to
go
with
a
burger
or
fish
and
chips

today
i
bought
a
12
pack
i
am
sad
to
say
that
the
experience
was
a
huge
letdown
out
of
the
can
or
poured
into
a
glass
the
beer
tasted
flat
and
bitter
with
an
almost
sour
aftertaste
like
vinegar
think
i
have
decided
that
i
am
finished
with
spending
money
on
boston
lager
from
a
store
its
just
a
different
beer
from
what
is
put
in
kegs
even
guinness
with
their
nitrogen
tap
manages
to
bottle
something
that
tastes
the
same
as
on
tap
get
it
together
sam
as
with
many
people
this
is
the
beer
that
introduced
me
to
the
craft
industry
and
still
to
this
day
remains
a
beer
that
i
can
always
count
on
for
a
quality
well
balance
beer
shocked
that
i
am
just
now
appreciating
it
enough
to
review
i
have
so
much
respect
for
jim
koch
and
sam
adams
and
what
they
have
done
for
the
beer
industry
cheers
o
for
some
odd
reason
this
was
my
first
tast
of
the
boston
lager
i
picked
up
the
harvest
collection
but
left
the
lagers
alone
because
i
thought
they
couldnt
stand
up
to
the
other
seasonal
beers
i
sure
was
wrong
this
one
is
solid
and
i
understand
why
this
is
one
of
the
staples
in
the
craft
world
it
seems
like
it
would
make
a
great
transitional
beer
from
bmc
to
craft
what
can
be
said
about
boston
lager
that
hasnt
been
said
before
it
is
just
one
of
the
classics
it
pours
up
a
deep
goldlight
copper
with
a
fluffy
one
finger
head
some
retention
and
elaborate
lacing
smell
is
biscuit
and
honey
mouthfeel
is
okay
with
decent
carbonation
taste
is
sweet
upfront
with
a
very
mild
metallic
note
but
the
bitterness
on
the
finish
balances
it
perfectly
simply
a
good
beer
found
everywhere
and
a
sure
thing
if
all
that
is
available
is
macros
or
sam
adams
355ml
bottle
poured
into
leffe
chalice
bronze
colour
clear
one

poor

but
kept
some

very
hoppy
aroma
detected
some
kentish
style
hops
plus
the
noble
hops
hallertau
and
tettnang
tasted
fruity
hints
of
apple
had
some
sweetness
which
was
balanced
out
by
the
long
bitter
finish
crisp
mouthfull
smooth
texture
and
was
well
carbonated
cant
add
too
much
more
to
what
has
already
been
said
but
it
was
refreshing
interesting
and
balanced
o
a
classic
in
the
craft
world
so
many
times
this
beer
has
saved
me
from
having
to
drink
macro
in
bars
and
restaurants
this
is
one
of
the
first
beers
that
introduced
me
to
the
other
side
it
will
always
be
a
goto
beer
for
me
and
one
that
compliments
sam
adams
seasonal
packs
quite
nicely
overall
this
is
a
solid
beer
that
is
conveniently
available
in
most
places
its
a
good
default
if
not
much
else
is
available
cheers
ive
tried
lots
of
the
boston
beer
companys
offerings
from
standard
yearround
brews
to
expensive
beers
that
come
in
fancy
bottles
boston
lager
is
its
best
considering
a
company
as
large
as
samuel
adams
its
still
obvious
that
they
put
a
lot
of
care
into
their
brews
as
far
as
the
larger
brew
companies
go
this
is
some
of
the
best
easy
to
drink
and
session
with
and
it
blows
bmc
beers
out
of
the
water
especially
for
the
relatively
low
price
ofor
many
of
us
sam
adams
is
the
first
definable
craft
beer
that
we
have
tasted
sam
adams
flagship
should
be
respected
for
what
it
has
done
for
the
industry
and
it
is
a
definitive
step
up
from
macro
brews
but
when
it
comes
to
taste
it
is
nothing
above
average
overall
rightly
or
wrongly
this
is
the
standard
vienna
lager
today
its
a
fairly
easydrinking
accessible
lager
with
a
good
amount
of
flavor
and
a
nice
hop
profile
nothing
worldchanging
but
something
i
never
mind
having
every
time
i
open
a
sam
adams
mixed
pack
o
it
seems
like
a
bit
of
a
cliche
choice
to
name
this
one
as
one
of
your
favorites
but
maybe
theres
a
reason
for
that
a
wellbalanced
beer
thats
refreshing
and
just
as
good
whether
youre
sipping
or
taking
a
big
gulp
poured
a
nice
clear
amber
with
a
thin
white
head
and
abundant
carbonation
bubbles
a
good
look
for
a
vienna
lager
scents
of
grainy
malt
sweet
honey
malt
and
some
undertones
of
earthy
and
herbal
european
hops
a
quite
nice
aroma
profile
malty
with
a
nice
hit
of
hops
very
good
taste
begins
with
sweet
caramel
and
honeylike
malt
flavors
backed
by
earthy
and
herbal
hop
flavors
the
hop
flavors
remain
throughout
the
sip
and
into
the
finish
and
aftertaste
midway
through
the
sip
the
hops
get
a
bit
more
intense
but
not
overly
so
still
balanced
by
sweet
malt
the
finish
continues
with
the
sweet
malt
and
hops
but
with
a
little
bit
more
grainy
malt
the
aftertaste
is
honey
grainy
malt
and
herbal
and
earthy
hops
a
nice
flavor
profile
very
balanced
between
malt
and
hops
pleasant
to
drink
mouthfeel
is
light
bodied
moderately
carbonated
on
point
for
the
style
with
a
crisp
feeling
very
good
what
a
lager
should
be
overall
this
is
a
good
session
lager
its
balanced
and
flavorful
but
light
enough
to
not
be
overwhelming
its
also
available
everywhere
which
is
nice
its
a
winner
the
mouthfeel
is
lighter
medium
and
its
very
refreshing
and
easy
to
drink
style
tick
how
have
i
not
done
this
one
yet
served
from
tap
into
a
shaker
poured
a
golden
yelloworange
with
a
one
finger
offwhite
head
that
remained
throughout
the
glass
maintained
excellent
lacing
throughout
the
glass
the
aroma
was
comprised
of
sweet
malt
citrus
earth
earth
hop
and
wheat
the
flavor
was
of
sweet
malt
citrus
earth
earth
hop
and
wheat
it
had
a
light
feel
on
the
palate
with
mediumhigh
carbonation
overall
this
was
a
pretty
decent
brew
i
have
to
give
this
beer
credit
as
it
has
definitely
done
its
part
with
converting
people
over
to
craft
beer
there
is
not
a
huge
amount
going
on
here
but
it
is
rather
easy
to
drink
and
is
fairly
well
balanced
at
the
same
time
this
fact
makes
it
rather
easy
to
drink
and
enjoyable
for
those
without
a
palate
for
big
and
bold
craft
beers
however
if
you
do
have
a
palate
like
that
this
one
might
not
be
your
favorite
but
always
remember
to
give
credit
where
it
is
due
and
this
one
deserves
some
of
that
overall
this
has
to
be
one
of
the
best
if
not
the
best
lagers
brewed
in
the
states
o
overall
this
beer
is
excellent
for
the
style
a
perfect
representation
of
how
the
other
macro
breweries
should
be
brewing
their
lagers
this
beer
is
delicious
and
great
for
somebody
wanting
to
transition
to
craft
its
definately
an
excellent
go
to
beer
will
continue
to
have
this
over
and
over
again
not
much
needs
to
be
said
of
boston
lager
everyones
tried
it
its
a
constantly
reliable
easy
drinker
with
considerable
taste
plenty
of
hops
nice
and
bubbly
refreshing
and
relentlessly
sessionable
most
fortunately
you
can
count
on
it
to
be
at
a
lot
of
bars
and
restaurants
so
you
wont
always
have
to
settle
for
awful
domestics
or
subpar
microsimports
fullflavored
and
balanced
super
easydrinking
this
beer
is
a
slight
amber
color
with
a
one
finger
white
head
the
aroma
matched
the
taste
this
is
definitely
a
lager
and
has
a
nice
crispness
to
it
there
is
a
surprisingly
present
hop
profile
in
here
that
i
wasnt
expecting
this
beer
is
however
mostly
malty
and
has
a
light
flavored
malt
profile
ranging
from
crystal
malts
to
toffee
a
heavier
feel
then
expecting
overall
a
solid
lager
that
wacks
all
the
domestics
out
of
the
park

boston
lager
is
a
tasty
balanced
session
brew
packed
with
far
more
flavour
than
your
typical
5ish
massproduced
lager
very
good
for
what
its
meant
to
be
and
something
most
beer
drinkers
from
the
most
hardcore
macro
swiller
to
the
most
uptight
of
bas
can
probably
appreciate
to
some
extent
a
solid
flagship
beer
that
i
will
most
likely
pick
up
again
at
some
point
final
thoughts
while
boston
lager
probably
the
only
samuel
adams
beer
that
i
would
buy
a
six
pack
of
i
dont
feel
any
urgency
to
go
and
do
so
however
where
craft
beer
for
the
masses
is
concerned
it
does
the
job
nicely
o
my
be
considered
a
gateway
beer
from
adjunct
to
craft
but
its
a
signature
beer
to
the
sam
adams
name
and
is
a
hell
of
a
lot
better
than
a
lot
of
brewers
signature
beers
hence
shock
top
blue
moon
wachusett
and
nantasket
ciscoand
maybe
harpoon
its
closest
rival
o
good
lager
beer
beautiful
colour
high
drinkability
appealing
hops
and
a
very
good
malty
taste
this
beer
is
so
consistently
tasty
that
i
felt
it
was
maybe
greater
than
the
sum
of
its
parts
and
deserved
a
4
5
still
a
clear
goto
at
bars
and
cstores
that
dont
really
do
craft
the
body
is
medium
and
carbonation
is
good
drinks
smoothly
and
very
easily
this
is
an
american
classic
an
early
seminal
craft
lager
that
shouldnt
be
overlooked
it
will
be
disdained
or
at
least
ignored
by
nouveau
drinkers
of
big
bigger
biggest
beers
but
its
solid
and
dependable
and
a
nice
session
choice
to
boot
a
great
flavorful
and
easy
drinking
lager
little
hoppy
for
a
vienna
lager
but
pretty
damn
good
and
available
almost
everywhere
overall
in
my
opinion
this
beer
is
perfectly
balanced
delicious
and
refreshing
this
is
my
goto
beer
at
a
bar
problem
i
have
with
the
beer
is
its
too
mainstream
for
the
hip
crowd
but
too
fancy
for
the
mainstream
joints
so
i
tend
to
either
overpay
or
never
see
this
beer
at
my
local
watering
holes
overall
still
my
all
time
favorite
and
always
my
beer
of
choice
still
great
and
always
great
samuel
adams
boston
lager
was
the
first
craft
beer
that
i
ever
tasted
i
imagine
this
is
true
for
a
number
of
bas
at
the
time
i
was
blown
away
now
i
still
like
it
but
i
realize
that
its
not
the
best
even
for
its
style
prior
to
the
bottle
that
i
am
currently
drinking
i
havent
had
this
in
a
while
and
its
because
i
think
this
beer
seriously
upsets
my
stomach
i
dont
know
why
but
i
guess
i
will
find
out
if
this
is
still
true
tomorrow
morning
after
paying
10
for
a
six
pack
of
the
disappointing
summer
ale
by
the
boston
beer
company
i
was
reluctant
to
give
this
stuff
a
try
but
holy
shit
am
i
glad
that
i
did
pours
a
clear
copper
with
a
beautiful
3
and
half
finger
white
head
some
bubbles
within
the
head
from
the
carbonation
just
adds
to
the
beauty
it
doesnt
sound
that
spectacular
but
you
must
see
it
for
yourself
the
smell
reminded
me
a
lot
of
the
latitude
48
ipa
grapefruit
lemon
hops
and
a
whole
variety
of
other
scents
coming
through
although
it
was
a
bit
toned
down
in
this
brew
still
smelled
great
the
taste
followed
the
smell
it
pretty
much
reminded
me
of
an
easier
slightly
lighter
version
of
the
latitude
48
lots
of
hops
lots
of
grapefruit
and
a
delicious
but
very
slight
sherbert
creaminess
flavor
in
the
finish
the
mouthfeel
is
just
as
good
the
flavors
pretty
much
stay
the
same
but
my
oh
my
is
it
creamy
and
delicious
definitely
one
of
the
best
beers
that
i
have
ever
had
if
not
the
best
pick
up
a
6
pack
of
this
now
i
love
the
malty
bready
taste
especially
on
the
first
sip
its
distinctively
boston
lager
ogreat
well
rounded
beer
have
had
it
on
numerous
occasions
and
just
got
around
to
reviewing
it
go
to
beer
at
places
that
doesnt
have
a
large
craft
beer
selection
its
hard
to
believe
i
havent
sat
down
to
review
this
one
yet
the
shining
light
when
stranded
somewhere
in
a
sea
of
macros
pours
a
solidly
clear
deep
golden
color
with
a
fuzzy
white
head
that
slowly
fades
but
also
leaves
some
stickage
on
the
glass
smells
of
bready
and
sweet
pilsner
malts
with
plenty
of
earthy
and
floral
hop
kick
to
go
around
the
flavor
is
rich
and
malty
with
lots
of
sweet
and
bready
honey
like
and
pilsner
malt
to
go
around
earthy
floral
and
herbal
hop
flavor
cuts
through
the
malt
to
provide
some
great
balance
medium
body
with
a
moderate
level
of
carbonation
and
a
slick
sweet
resinous
mouthfeel
this
is
a
great
beer
and
over
the
years
as
my
palette
has
changed
its
great
to
see
what
more
i
can
pick
out
of
this
beer
i
still
think
its
too
hoppy
for
a
vienna
lager
but
the
hop
head
in
me
likes
that
more
now
very
easy
to
drink
a
great
intro
to
craft
type
beers
o
definitely
a
big
step
up
from
your
typical
choices
at
bars
wouldnt
go
out
of
my
way
to
get
it
at
a
restaurant
or
to
tailgate
though
overall
above
average
samuel
adams
boston
lager
has
an
appearance
that
is
pale
amber
in
colour
the
aroma
is
clearly
bready
malty
with
a
tinge
of
spice
it
is
a
simple
almost
gentle
beer
which
can
be
enjoyed
at
a
summer
picnic
in
the
woods
its
got
a
full
flavour
and
a
clean
finish
delicious
jim
you
are
the
rock
star
of
the
beer
biz
overallone
of
my
top
favorites
im
really
into
ipas
but
this
will
always
be
my
go
to
beer
still
a
well
put
together
beer
after
about
a
million
of
these
ill
finally
review
it
this
time
everyone
knows
what
it
looks
like
with
its
specially
made
glassware
it
smells
like
english
malts
bready
and
a
little
sweet
crisp
but
not
light
flavor
is
pretty
standard
but
its
well
made
it
really
is
more
flavor
than
a
lot
of
mass
produced
stuff
but
nearly
equally
easy
drinking
a
real
legitimate
malt
complexion
with
a
quicker
finish
perhaps
a
little
more
body
than
i
want
in
a
lager
and
gets
a
little
filling
after
a
few
at
the
end
of
the
day
its
at
every
bar
and
it
beats
budlight
by
a
lightyear
because
of
that
its
good
im
never
going
to
buy
it
at
a
store
but
at
a
shitty
pub
ill
take
a
pint
any
day
can
be
a
refresher
when
its
ice
cold
the
taste
is
a
balance
of
mildly
sweet
and
bready
malts
and
hop
flavors
hop
bitterness
balances
the
back
end
well
without
a
strong
lingering
aftertaste
there
is
mild
citrus
from
the
hops
present
in
the
flavor
the
flavors
are
well
balanced
the
body
is
light
to
medium
with
adequate
carbonation
the
finish
is
dry
it
is
refreshing
the
drinkability
is
very
high
overall
this
is
an
excellent
beer
that
pairs
well
with
meals
or
as
a
regular
session
beer
o
sam
adams
flagship
beer
is
a
solid
one
theres
nothing
outstanding
going
on
here
but
it
is
a
very
wellbalanced
beer
with
a
diverse
profile
of
malt
and
hop
aromas
and
flavors
great
example
of
a
vienna
lager
theres
a
reason
why
this
is
known
as
a
gateway
beer
into
the
craft
world
its
available
almost
everywhere
cheap
sessionable
not
offensive
in
any
way
and
damn
tasty
for
as
mass
produced
as
it
is
the
flavor
is
really
excellent
and
it
is
a
very
solid
beer
overall
the
color
is
nice
the
feel
in
the
mouth
doesnt
offend
and
the
hops
carry
the
beer
to
a
finish
that
very
few
beers
if
any
can
match
on
this
scale
of
production
i
ordered
a
perfect
pint
and
am
looking
forward
to
using
it
o
this
beer
is
very
easy
to
drink
and
definitely
quite
sessionable
to
me
this
was
a
gateway
beer
to
the
craft
beer
scene
way
back
in
the
early
1990s
when
i
first
started
to
drink
it
the
beer
has
a
nice
flavor
but
it
is
not
one
of
my
overall
favorites
o
a
nicely
hopped
and
complex
lager
which
dances
across
the
palate
with
a
pleasant
character
and
overall
crisp
taste
just
plain
well
rounded
i
highly
recommend
this
as
a
permanent
upgrade
for
anybody
considering
bringing
any
of
the
4
beers
mentioned
in
the
opening
paragraph
to
a
party
its
just
better
no
debate
about
it
a
very
good
example
of
the
style
easy
to
drink
but
it
scales
well
for
the
appreciation
of
the
beer
enthusiast
as
well
a
go
to
beer
on
many
occasions
lovely
light
golden
amber
with
a
good
sized
head
and
wonderful
retention
nice
lacing
smell
carries
a
nice
malt
sweetness
and
good
yeasty
bread
with
a
lovely
spiciness
and
light
leafy
hop
character
taste
is
well
balanced
with
a
solid
bready
malt
core
of
caramel
with
a
hint
of
molasses
and
caramel
sweetness
superbly
balanced
hop
bitterness
is
an
artful
combination
of
florals
and
spicy
but
gentle
sazz
like
notes
feel
is
crisp
with
mildly
a
carbonated
almost
creamy
touch
light
enough
for
sessioning
but
enough
weight
to
satisfy
with
one
a
great
beer
in
total
and
one
i
enjoy
again
and
again
if
my
drinking
consisted
of
this
and
a
few
choice
now
and
thens
i
would
find
enough
quality
variety
and
flavor
to
be
happy
o
a
tasty
beer
and
always
a
solid
choice
when
looking
for
a
step
up
from
a
macro
lager
the
epitome
of
a
gateway
to
craft
beer
on
tap
this
is
an
exceptional
beer
imo
bottled
version
however
isnt
as
good
as
the
tap
version
this
is
by
far
the
best
american
style
lager
i
have
had
maybe
they
should
change
the
name
to
samuel
adams
perfect
balance
balance
between
malt
and
hops
are
amazing
and
hit
at
the
just
the
right
time
neither
being
overpowering
carbonation
is
spot
on
as
well
this
is
definitely
my
yearround
go
to
beer
i
like
a
few
other
sa
beers
but
its
often
hard
to
beat
the
original
a
true
american
staple
im
proud
to
drink
poured
into
a
perfect
pint
pours
a
goldenred
with
a
finger
and
a
half
of
white
head
smells
of
toasted
malt
and
spiced
hops
nothing
too
extreme
but
quite
pleasant
nonetheless
taste
is
a
smooth
balance
of
light
roasted
malt
hop
spice
and
lingering
bitterness
the
mouthfeel
is
surprisingly
fullbodied
for
a
lager
of
this
style
overall
a
very
sessionable
beer
and
a
reliable
standby
and
a
great
option
to
introduce
a
novice
to
craft
beer
overall
a
reliably
good
beer
that
walks
the
line
of
craft
brew
and
mass
appeal
id
drink
it
any
day
overall
a
decent
beer
but
nothing
special
overall
a
very
solid
beer
when
in
the
course
of
human
events
it
becomes
necessary
to
drink
a
more
perfect
beer
one
should
really
start
with
a
samuel
adams
boston
lager
back
in
the
dark
ages
when
all
you
could
get
at
the
packie
were
buds
and
coors
and
millers
in
rode
sammy
a
proclaiming
that
better
beers
were
coming
for
the
betterment
of
all
humanity
approachable
flavor
classy
packaging
i
especially
like
the
design
of
the
22oz
bombers
and
an
extremely
affordable
price
3
2522oz
have
likely
been
responsible
for
the
enlightenment
of
many
a
swill
chugger
the
real
treat
of
sam
adams
however
is
that
it
takes
the
lager
the
most
american
of
beer
styles
and
elevates
it
to
a
level
on
par
with
more
evolved
styles
even
after
all
these
years
it
remains
a
true
pioneer
and
sets
a
standard
that
few
lagers
can
match
cheers
original
review
on
09092010
i
think
its
a
good
start
for
starting
to
drink
better
beers
and
that
said
there
are
plenty
of
better
beers
out
there
the
beer
is
slightly
sweet
and
has
a
great
malty
flavor
with
a
slight
toffee
finish
a
great
session
beer
and
its
availability
makes
it
a
great
alternative
to
the
bmc
versions
found
everywhere
highly
recommended
especially
if
you
know
someone
that
is
a
novice
when
it
comes
to
craftspecialty
beers
while
not
my
favorite
lager
not
sweet
enough
as
said
earlier
this
is
still
quite
good
definitely
a
staple
that
i
wish
others
would
follow
in
making
good
quality
euro
lagers
and
has
remained
this
way
for
decades
o
classic
lager
well
balanced
good
beer
for
anytime
overall
pound
for
pound
one
of
the
best
beers
i
have
had
it
religiously
especially
when
i
hit
the
bar
it
is
the
best
failsafe
out
there
it
has
everything
to
offer
salud
cheers
excellent
appearence
and
smell
taste
a
little
on
the
bitter
side
for
me
good
to
enjoy
one
before
lunch
clear
golden
color
head
not
formed
well
on
the
glass
i
used
for
the
taste
test
i
am
not
really
a
fan
of
bitter
beers
maybe
i
have
to
get
accustomed
to
it
before
i
can
rate
another
bitter
beer
taste
is
hops
up
front
bitter
herb
and
some
slight
bitter
citrus
punch
roasted
chewy
malt
comes
next
with
some
caramel
notes
a
nice
full
body
finishes
dry
with
a
bitter
herb
bite
an
excellent
beer
i
hadnt
had
this
since
i
got
into
craft
returning
to
it
now
i
am
surprised
how
good
it
still
is
o
lagers
kind
of
get
overlooked
a
bit
in
my
opinion
i
myself
am
slightly
guilty
of
this
so
its
always
a
good
idea
to
enjoy
a
classic
craft
brew
such
as
boston
lager
this
is
just
a
really
solid
beer
super
easy
to
drink
perfect
session
option
overall
drinkability
i
wonder
did
the
bar
get
this
beer
diluted
it
doesnt
seem
up
to
snuff
somehow
i
seem
to
remember
this
beer
as
maltier
when
ive
had
it
in
the
past
but
maybe
my
palate
has
changed
so
much
im
tasting
this
quite
differently
than
i
remember
not
sure
ill
have
to
try
it
one
more
time
at
a
place
where
i
know
i
can
rely
up
on
the
quality
and
see
if
the
beer
is
different
yet
again
if
its
better
this
one
is
getting
deleted
as
again
something
isnt
quite
right
or
my
palate
has
really
changed
a
lot
since
the
last
time
i
had
this
beer
o
well
this
is
sam
adams
flagship
what
can
i
say
i
dont
speak
bad
about
this
one
its
good
for
the
style
and
good
for
me
o
i
still
consider
this
a
very
good
beer
nice
drinking
httpabarwithnoname
wordpress
com1001beers
this
is
worth
it
this
is
in
my
opinion
one
of
the
best
session
beers
that
wont
break
the
bank
it
smells
great
and
malty
tasting
like
it
smells
i
would
drink
this
any
day
the
color
golden
and
body
medium
and
head
lingering
are
more
typical
of
ales
which
make
this
lager
a
great
and
interesting
beer
go
pick
up
a
6
pack
o
boston
lager
is
a
classic
for
sure
the
style
is
pretty
plain
but
its
a
very
nice
beer
im
glad
sam
adams
puts
it
in
all
their
mixed
packs
because
while
i
enjoy
this
beer
it
isnt
something
i
would
buy
in
a
six
pack
o
living
in
boston
ive
had
the
boston
lager
quite
a
few
times
it
is
a
decent
go
to
beer
that
is
always
in
the
sam
adams
mixed
12
pack
nothing
amazing
but
always
a
decent
session
beer
d
overall
an
extremely
well
made
beer
i
think
my
only
problem
with
it
is
a
problem
of
mine
and
comes
with
the
territory
its
simplistic
but
its
so
good
and
like
i
said
its
not
the
beers
fault
the
trend
leans
to
the
over
indulged
complexity
hogs
o
a
nice
beer
nothing
too
exciting
though
had
this
in
the
bottle
and
poured
into
a
pint
glass
i
have
not
had
this
in
ages
and
forgot
that
this
is
one
of
those
iconic
beers
that
changed
beer
to
more
of
a
craft
great
color
good
head
nice
balance
and
mouthfeel
this
is
still
a
very
solid
craft
beer
overall
a
fantastically
complex
lager
that
is
one
of
my
favourites
of
the
style
now
very
drinkable
will
definitely
be
picking
up
more
for
the
fridge
well
done
boston
beer
company
deep
amber
color
with
an
ample
white
head
after
the
pour
gives
off
a
decent
hop
aroma
but
nothing
spectacular
flavor
begins
malty
with
some
hop
bitterness
increasing
in
prevalance
over
the
finish
thin
mouthfeel
a
well
balanced
beer
but
nothing
remarkable
crisp
flavorful
drinkable
the
poster
child
of
american
craft
well
o
a
classic
its
fallen
out
of
my
regular
beers
recently
but
ill
have
to
go
back
to
it
more
often
because
its
still
a
great
tasty
beer
o
one
of
my
favorites
and
something
i
try
to
have
often
decently
priced
yeah
theres
quite
a
few
better
beers
but
this
one
definitely
deserves
respect
overall
this
was
a
very
enjoyable
beer
i
could
see
myself
drinking
this
on
a
cold
snowy
night
here
in
colorado
or
with
a
greasy
hamburger
or
hotdog
for
the
price
and
availability
this
is
an
a
beer
ov
the
prototypical
craft
beer
gateway
the
price
point
is
acceptable
and
it
invites
a
novice
drinker
to
explore
it
what
lies
ahead
is
proof
that
better
options
are
in
store
there
are
far
better
choices
but
almost
everyone
should
embrace
this
stepping
stone
before
climbing
the
entire
mountain
of
exquisite
beer
selections
poured
from
a
12
oz
bottle
into
a
14
oz
pint
glass
pours
a
darker
straw
color
with
a
small
white
head
that
dissipates
slowly
and
leaves
great
lacing
smells
of
malt
dominantly
and
some
sweet
tones
possibly
from
hops
but
cannot
put
my
finger
on
it
tastes
of
sweet
malt
with
a
a
little
bite
of
hops
but
definitely
on
the
malt
heavy
side
which
is
fine
for
a
basic
lager
but
this
one
is
superiority
more
flavorful
than
most
american
lagers
carbonation
a
tad
heavy
but
not
offensively
so
goes
down
smooth
with
no
bad
aftertastes
and
definitely
sessionable
overall
a
very
good
beer
and
one
of
my
mainstays
when
i
go
to
bars
with
not
much
selection
of
on
tab
beers
as
many
will
have
this
one
d
its
always
been
a
decent
beer
for
me
one
thats
drinkable
fair
quality
and
fairly
priced
o
i
was
expecting
it
to
taste
like
bud
or
millers
so
i
was
quite
taken
aback
by
its
hoppiness
exactly
the
sort
of
profile
i
like
in
a
cask
ale
not
quite
a
world
class
beer
but
as
far
as
mass
produced
lagers
go
its
the
dogs
bollocks
very
flavoursome
as
a
default
beer
this
would
definitely
appeal
to
british
ale
drinkers
would
easily
rival
guinness
ill
definitely
drink
more
but
on
the
whole
the
flavour
although
delicious
just
doesnt
go
far
enough
for
me
though
o
first
tried
this
a
few
years
ago
and
did
not
like
it
this
was
back
when
i
knew
no
beer
other
than
bmc
products
i
normally
get
two
of
these
22oz
bottles
a
couple
times
a
week
now
1
99bottle
makes
a
good
after
dinner
treat
look
very
clear
orange
amber
color
with
good
looking
lumpy
frothy

pretty
faint
spicy

good

graininess
with
a
good

lots
of

coming
up
on

light
bitter

faint

good

out
a
standard
amber
color
with
good
clarity
and
an
impressive
craggy

white
fluffy
head
which
lasts
for
a
minute
but
leaves
behind
nice
loops
of
lacing
has
a
total
aroma
spectrum
of
noble
hopping
earthy
spicing
and
herbal
all
represented
in
approximately
equal
amounts
in
both
the
nose
and
in
the
flavor
alongside
a
lovely
caramel
malt
all
with
a
smooth
medium
bodied
texture
that
has
the
right
amount
of
carbonation
too
keep
things
lively
in
the
mouth
without
being
overly
distracting
one
of
the
staple
workhorse
lagers
on
the
market
and
it
is
not
difficult
to
see
why
havent
tasted
a
ton
of
beers
the
world
over
but
this
is
one
of
the
best
lagers
i
have
tasted
getting
a
decent
smell
and
taste
into
a
lager
is
a
nice
accomplishment
good
job
sam
adams
o
best
thing
about
this
beer
is
if
im
in
a
shitty
bar
in
the
middle
of
nowhere
i
can
find
this
on
tap
and
be
happy
with
it
defnitely
a
good
beer
perfect
balance
between
hops
and
malts
pours
a
nice
frothy
head
immediately
notice
hops
and
finishes
with
nice
malty
sweetness
this
beer
is
good
for
just
about
any
occasion
for
sure
an
american
classic
without
too
many
peers
o
this
is
a
good
beer
it
lives
up
to
the
hype
behold
the
success
of
the
boston
beer
co
brand
reviewed
with
the
style
in
mind
ofcourse
hench
the
high
marks
im
enjoying
it
though
very
much
so
and
id
recommend
giving
it
a
shot
if
youve
never
done
so
its
at
least
worth
a
onetime
experience
o
when
you
step
into
bobs
country
bunker
and
are
looking
at
the
full
bmc
lineup
with
a
boston
lager
trailing
on
the
end
well
both
select
this
beer
very
drinkable
but
most
other
craft
exceeds
this
brew
3
5
overall
the
best
lager
ive
ever
had
for
sure
smooth
with
slightly
more
hops
than
other
lagers
ive
had
great
as
a
standalone
beer
or
as
an
everyday
beer
for
being
so
attainable
this
is
a
wonderful
beer
the
flavors
play
into
each
other
very
well
m
light
bodied
with
a
good
touch
of
carbonation
serving
type
bottle
pours
a
medium
brown
color
with
a
thin
head
into
my
snifter
minimal
lacing
on
the
side
of
the
glass
very
clear
in
appearance
the
nose
is
yeast
malt
and
slight
hops
very
crisp
smelling
brew
nothing
noteworthy
or
offensive
here
the
taste
follows
suit
this
is
a
very
sessionable
brew
one
that
you
could
put
several
down
and
not
notice
the
abv
feel
is
lightly
carbonated
clean
and
crisp
overall
a
good
beer
for
the
style
cheers
o
this
is
a
very
solid
lager
that
i
have
enjoyed
numerous
times
its
very
well
balanced
with
the
biscuitybready
and
noble
hop
flavors
its
also
super
drinkable
and
has
a
taste
that
is
truly
unmatched
i
can
see
why
sam
adams
includes
this
flagship
beer
in
many
of
their
variety
packs
as
its
a
great
beer
to
enjoy
with
good
company
overall
decent
beer
for
when
you
want
a
beer
and
arent
too
fussed
with
what
sort
and
arent
looking
to
think
about
it
or
remember
it
if
average
is
defined
by
the
range
of
craft
beers
it
is
for
me
this
is
average
if
average
is
macro
territory
this
is
a
bit
above
average
its
not
a
beer
i
look
for
or
crave
but
rather
is
one
ill
accept
and
be
thankful
for
when
the
other
options
are
macros
overall
a
solid
beer
from
sam
adams
that
appeals
to
a
wide
array
of
beer
drinkers
its
their
most
popular
beer
but
not
their
best
imo
over
the
years
ive
found
i
can
get
through
3
or
4
of
these
puppies
before
looking
to
bring
a
reliever
into
the
game
drinks
closer
to
a
red
ale
than
your
standard
lager
underrated
around
these
parts
but
it
deserves
the
all
the
praise
it
has
received
recommended
overall
who
is
to
say
that
the
flagship
beers
of
large
commercial
breweries
cant
be
good
is
really
mistaken
sam
adams
boston
lager
is
fantastic
you
know
i
hadnt
really
had
this
beer
for
years
and
to
be
honest
its
probably
better
then
i
remember
sam
adams
is
interesting
to
me
some
of
their
beers
i
find
barely
drinkable
and
others
like
their
flagship
beer
i
think
are
just
solid
and
decent
all
around
that
being
said
i
think
this
beer
in
terms
of
appearance
smell
taste
and
mouthfeel
is
a
beer
that
was
responsible
for
bringing
people
over
to
the
craft
beer
side
and
i
can
see
why
its
got
some
hops
but
its
not
overly
aggressive
it
has
some
slight
sweetness
in
the
taste
its
well
balanced
it
is
certainly
more
full
then
the
common
american
adjust
lager
definitely
enjoyable
and
easy
to
drink
overall
to
me
its
average
it
appears
it
wants
to
be
something
better
than
budwieser
which
i
guess
it
is
but
the
characteristics
of
it
do
not
really
distinguish
it
as
something
id
brag
about
thats
me
and
my
0
02
od
a
solid
lager
clearly
a
classic
with
a
great
hop
character
and
balance
very
drinkable
its
a
good
starter
craft
beer
and
often
the
best
beer
available
at
chain
restaurants
but
nothing
special
lacking
only
a
bit
more
crispness
to
be
spot
on
style
wise
this
is
a
very
nice
vienna
lager
in
my
opinion
along
the
same
line
as
dos
equis
amber
which
i
like
alot
for
an
any
day
brew
with
about
any
food
this
is
a
solid
a
vienna
to
me
i
wonder
how
many
people
widened
their
beer
horizons
with
a
sip
of
sam
adams
who
could
resist
its
not
very
bitter
but
it
does
provide
a
painless
education
in
hoppiness
a
distinctive
and
reliable
beer
ive
found
it
in
the
driest
beer
deserts
as
well
as
the
cheesiest
mexican
joints
i
think
boston
brewing
does
us
all
a
service
by
making
so
this
flavorful
beer
so
popular
and
widely
available
overall
a
very
enjoyable
lager
nice
flavors
well
balanced
and
drinkable
a
very
good
gateway
beer
overall
a
very
sessionable
lager
just
not
much
there
still
a
step
up
from
the
regular
bmc
selections
a
great
stepping
stone
to
more
flavorful
sam
adams
offerings
o
this
one
is
an
american
classic
wellrounded
balanced
and
sessionable
for
most
bmc
drinkers
that
turn
into
craft
beer
drinkers
this
is
one
of
the
gateways
cheers
overall
its
a
nice
hoppy
beer
very
enjoyable
give
this
one
a
try
o
the
one
that
introduced
me
to
better
beers
tasty
balanced
affordable
great
feel
sessionable
works
throughout
the
year
a
staple
for
a
reason
the
body
is
light
with
good
carbonation
overall
this
one
is
really
a
staple
ive
had
hundreds
of
times
and
ill
have
it
again
its
never
m
first
choice
but
it
never
seems
to
be
a
bad
one
notes
refreshing
thirst
quenching
and
at
4
9
abv
a
highly
sessionable
beer
priced
nicely
and
ubiquitous
this
should
be
an
icon
of
american
beer
o
this
is
a
really
nice
vienna
lager
that
is
not
nearly
as
heavy
as
some
interpretations
of
the
style
though
this
may
not
be
the
most
exciting
craft
brew
out
there
it
has
stood
the
test
of
time
and
is
deserving
of
its
reputation
as
an
american
classic
if
you
havent
tried
this
beer
ignore
the
detractors
and
give
it
a
fair
shot
o
cant
knock
this
great
for
the
price
and
an
above
average
gateway
beer
honestly
am
glad
beers
like
this
are
starting
to
dominate
the
larger
beer
markets
o
a
solid
blevel
craft
beer
thats
available
at
nearly
any
bar
or
corner
store
i
cant
count
the
number
of
times
i
have
been
at
a
restaurant
and
been
saved
from
drinking
bmc
products
by
this
beer
if
im
in
a
hurry
to
get
to
a
party
or
function
where
there
is
a
need
to
bring
beer
and
i
only
have
time
for
a
stop
at
a
convenience
store
this
is
still
a
solid
choice
drank
a
million
of
them
over
the
years
and
probably
have
many
more
ahead
of
me
enjoy

o
samuel
adams
boston
lager
is
a
classic
i
have
a
long
history
with
this
beer
it
was
my
first
legal
beer
and
first
craft
beer
and
its
always
worth
a
revisit
its
not
the
most
exciting
or
complex
beer
but
an
old
friend
and
a
great
standby
whenever
youre
at
a
bar
with
limited
craft
options
you
dont
need
a
review
for
this
its
sam
adams
lager
not
bad
quite
sessionable
in
fact
though
it
has
in
no
way
converted
me
from
my
preference
for
ales
o
one
i
just
never
order
glad
to
finally
try
it
i
keep
forgetting
this
is
a
lager
an
impressive
lager
brew
not
sure
why
but
ive
found
the
bottle
beer
to
be
often
better
than
the
tap
beer
this
is
the
only
beer
ive
found
this
to
be
the
case
prefer
bottle
over
tap
often
find
some
off
flavors
with
the
sams
lager
on
tap
o
one
of
the
best
go
to
beers
around
sure
id
pick
a
lot
of
other
beers
before
this
one
but
consider
this
i
can
walk
a
couple
hundred
feet
to
the
local
dive
bar
and
pick
up
one
of
these
for
about
a
buck
fifty
i
can
find
it
just
about
any
place
that
serves
liquor
and
many
times
this
is
the
only
other
option
apart
from
bmc
corona
and
maybe
heineken
while
its
just
good
overall
its
versatile
nature
and
superb
sessionability
make
it
ideal
for
luring
bmc
drinkers
into
the
world
of
craft
this
is
a
session
beer
that
will
wind
up
in
my
fridge
again
o
probably
the
most
versitle
beers
ever
great
for
any
season
any
occasion
very
sessionable
great
balance
theres
a
reason
its
the
real
king
of
beers
this
is
a
great
anytime
beer
really
good
but
not
over
the
top
in
any
way
simple
and
amazing
beer
im
surprised
i
have
not
reviewed
this
before
o
not
to
shabby
enjoyed
2
glasses
of
it
doubt
i
would
pick
it
over
some
other
local
craft
but
out
at
a
restaurant
wouldnt
mind
another
glass
overall
a
very
well
crafted
beer
just
enou
hops
but
very
well
balanced
this
has
been
popular
for
a
long
time
for
good
reason
its
a
solid
well
crafter
brew
if
this
were
the
sort
of
beer
i
liked
i
could
see
how
this
might
become
a
goto
widely
available
brewed
by
a
macro
brewer
who
still
has
significant
roots
in
the
craft
scene
hard
to
be
outstanding
in
the
style
but
this
is
not
bad
not
bad
at
all
overall
very
nice
and
easy
drinker
hoppy
and
malty
moreso
then
most
lagers
ive
had
a
great
starter
or
evening
sipper
or
a
great
option
if
your
at
a
bar
and
all
they
have
is
nasty
macro
beers
on
tap
nice
great
copper
orange
color
that
develops
a
good
head
of
thick
bubbles
when
poured
in
the
center
of
a
pint
glass
yeasty
maltiness
and
some
good
hop
scents
jump
from
the
glass
good
refreshing
carbonation
this
one
is
a
great
standby
and
will
always
satisfy
this
is
about
the
only
lager
that
i
enjoy
good
example
of
the
samuel
adams
lineup
cheers
flavors
are
similar
some
bready
malt
sweetness
fruity
yeast
feels
a
bit
more
full
bodied
than
many
lagers
lingering
toastiness
with
a
slight
floral
hop
note
little
to
no
hop
bitterness
present
easy
to
have
a
couple
with
food
a
pretty
versatile
above
average
lager
pours
an
amber
color
with
a
one
finger
head
that
sticks
around
with
decent
lacing
aroma
of
caramel
malts
with
a
decent
hop
aroma
taste
follows
the
nose
great
balance
between
sweetness
and
bitterness
crisp
and
clean
this
is
a
refreshing
highly
drinkable
brew
its
nothing
mind
blowing
but
its
a
good
all
around
beer
worth
the
try
far
better
than
any
other
big
name
beers
stateside
o
always
a
faithful
standby
there
is
a
reason
the
samuel
adams
boston
lager
is
the
flagship
brew
of
boston
beer
company
widely
available
and
infinitely
drinkable
you
cant
go
wrong
with
this
beer
wherever
you
are
delicacy
and
attention
to
detail
are
king
for
this
style
this
beer
boston
beer
company
has
done
a
great
job
its
a
good
brew
enjoy
overall
man
i
love
this
stuff
whether
its
winter
spring
summer
or
fall
this
beer
is
appropriate
for
all
times
easy
to
drink
and
easy
to
enjoy
great
taste
and
an
awesome
beer
overall
a
very
good
flavorful
and
refreshing
beer
very
well
balanced
and
extremely
sessionable
overall
this
beers
all
right
with
me
its
pretty
session
worthy
and
a
good
price
o
delicious
available
cant
believe
i
havent
tried
this
in
years
wonderful
and
cheap
beer
overall
an
american
classic
and
it
earned
it
boston
lager
along
with
snpa
and
a
couple
of
other
brews
is
and
always
will
be
one
of
the
quintessential
entrylevel
and
old
favorite
craft
beers
of
me
and
many
other
drinkers
it
remains
balanced
tasty
easydrinking
but
subtly
complex
ive
had
this
many
times
but
ive
only
reviewed
it
on
tap
poured
from
a
12
oz
bottle
into
a
pint
glass
best
before
dec
date
this
pours
a
nice
amber
color
with
nice
foamy
white
held
with
good
retention
the
smells
are
of
crisp
floral
hops
and
malts
the
feel
is
medium
the
taste
is
pretty
good
crisp
floral
hops
and
a
nice
malts
backbone
this
was
always
one
of
my
early
go
to
beers
and
its
still
good
these
days
even
if
i
dont
get
it
as
often
i
will
gladly
take
a
boston
lager
when
im
out
at
a
bar
or
restaurant
it
wouldnt
necessarily
be
my
first
choice
given
other
craft
options
however
i
love
that
this
beer
is
so
widely
available
for
a
solid
fallback
a
very
nice
smooth
and
easy
drinking
craft
lager
i
recommend
this
as
a
gateway
beer
for
people
drinking
adjunct
lagers
that
want
to
move
on
to
something
much
much
better
took
me
a
while
to
actually
write
down
my
thoughts
on
this
standard
of
american
mainstream
craft
beer
pours
a
deep
golden
34
inch
head
into
my
chalice
smell
is
inviting
but
not
too
overpowering
malty
but
not
too
angry
the
lacing
urges
me
to
take
the
beer
and
have
my
way
with
it
and
i
do
nice
firm
malty
backbone
slightly
sassy
with
a
nice
smack
of
hoppy
bitterness
not
trying
to
prove
anything
with
its
medium
body
this
lager
has
got
what
it
takes
to
keep
my
attention
definitely
sessionable
and
overall
my
go
to
beer
when
the
establishment
i
frequent
cannot
provide
an
exotic
beer
overall
definitely
one
of
the
better
options
for
draft
beer
at
most
restaurants
in
my
area
i
can
see
how
this
would
work
well
as
a
gateway
beer
to
get
people
away
from
drinking
basic
boring
macros
o
one
of
the
best
lagers
on
the
market
i
am
not
a
huge
lager
fan
but
it
tastes
good
and
it
easy
to
drink
poured
into
13
oz
tulip
pours
a
nice
bright
amber
with
a
nice
one
inch
head
some
lacing
smell
is
bready
some
citrus
and
pine
taste
is
that
with
a
hint
of
carmel
very
easy
to
drink
this
is
the
beer
that
17
years
ago
changed
me
all
i
wanted
to
do
is
find
that
same
reaction
to
another
beer
that
i
had
to
my
first
sammy
then
i
found
ba
a
year
and
half
ago
and
have
been
amazed
so
many
times
since
still
a
nice
beer
overall
im
not
a
lager
guy
but
this
beer
is
outstanding
compared
to
other
lagers
a
session
beer
goes
great
with
bbqs
something
nice
to
share
with
friends
one
of
the
beers
that
people
often
transition
to
from
drinking
the
macro
beers
their
available
almost
everywhere
a
nice
beer
and
something
you
should
try
if
you
havent
o
one
of
the
best
lagars
i
have
had
i
would
try
again
and
would
love
to
trey
on
draught
overall
honestly
i
might
agree
with
jim
koch
that
this
is
the
diaper
dandy
of
the
samuel
adams
line
it
is
a
wonderful
lager
with
great
malt
and
hop
balance
why
dont
i
get
this
more
often
pours
a
clear
medium
amber
big
white
head
fades
quickly
nice
floral
german
hop
aroma
no
citrus
or
pine
light
on
carbonation
making
the
mouthfeel
a
bit
bland
very
gentle
on
the
palate
easy
to
enjoy
more
than
one
in
a
sitting
overall
an
above
average
selection
iconic
beer
with
wide
appeal
very
easy
drinking
beer
it
has
some
pleasant
subtle
complexities
the
near
perfect
balance
goes
down
easy
and
the
ber
is
very
widely
available
always
a
good
go
to
beer
overall
this
is
one
of
my
go
to
beers
and
is
especially
great
during
warm
weather
a
perfect
example
of
what
a
mass
produced
american
lager
should
taste
like
overall
nothing
special
here
the
aftertaste
lingers
way
too
long
not
an
enjoyable
experience
not
as
good
as
some
of
their
other
brews
overall
i
havent
had
one
of
these
in
years
in
college
i
was
quite
fond
of
it
but
now
that
my
palate
has
changed
this
really
isnt
anything
special
one
of
the
better
mass
produced
beers
though
obviously
i
do
give
sam
adams
a
lot
of
respect
especially
for
their
variety
packs
that
usually
have
6
beers
in
them
to
allow
novice
drinkers
a
warm
welcoming
to
try
something
new
o
their
flagship
beer
obviously
its
really
quite
good
very
drinkable
and
a
crowd
pleaser
to
be
sure
a
nice
compromise
between
flavor
and
taste
overall
this
is
a
solid
lager
and
likely
to
be
a
staple
to
those
who
enjoy
classic
and
subtle
lagers
in
the
german
tradition
highly
drinkable
and
able
to
be
enjoyed
multiple
times
pretty
mediocre
beer
nothing
stands
out
forgettable
and
boring
not
sessionable
as
id
loathe
this
taste
in
my
mouth
for
longer
than
necessary
b
average
lol
overall
a
satisfying
product
extremely
sessionable
lager
that
is
ubiquitous
in
the
us
affordable
and
fresh
you
can
find
it
almost
anywhere
share
with
friends
even
though
i
only
bought
and
had
the
one
bottle
during
my
session
this
was
weak
enough
in
the
alcohol
department
that
i
could
have
easily
had
two
or
three
i
know
that
lagers
get
a
bad
rap
on
here
since
they
dont
measure
up
to
their
stylistic
opposites
but
this
beer
is
as
dark
complex
and
enjoyable
as
most
ales
on
the
market
its
not
the
best
beer
available
on
tap
as
might
have
been
the
case
when
this
was
new
in
the
80s
but
all
beer
lovers
owe
a
debt
of
gratitude
for
the
trailblazing
role
that
this
brew
once
had
its
just
as
good
now
and
still
deserves
to
be
considered
a
classic
overall
a
good
lager
well
balanced
not
very
complex
overall
i
had
a
much
better
drinking
experience
with
boston
lager
this
time
than
the
first
time
i
had
it
the
first
time
it
was
just
not
balanced
to
me
and
the
hops
were
unpleasant
what
a
difference
some
time
makes
in
taste
o
a
good
new
england
standby
a
wellrounded
anytime
beer
nice
if
you
want
something
a
little
heavier
without
being
thick
i
do
love
how
this
looks
in
the
glass
o
i
got
into
craft
beer
because
of
the
ales
i
listened
to
all
of
those
who
insisted
that
lagers
not
be
overlooked
for
their
quality
is
a
more
subtle
one
and
i
agree
this
a
quality
beer
and
i
will
be
looking
to
try
more
o
personally
i
prefer
the
boston
ale
over
the
boston
lager
but
this
is
still
a
decent
beer
sessionable
and
reasonably
priced
not
sure
id
seek
it
out
but
i
wouldnt
turn
one
down
either
o
an
old
standby
that
is
still
pretty
solid
o
okay
i
used
to
drink
lots
of
sam
adams
years
ago
before
so
many
other
great
breweries
and
beers
were
out
there
to
choose
from
now
with
so
much
other
great
beer
around
and
wonderful
selections
readily
available
i
dont
drink
near
as
much
sa
but
they
still
make
good
beer
and
it
can
be
purchased
in
so
many
places
a
good
beer
that
holds
a
special
place
in
my
heart
since
it
is
one
that
got
me
into
a
more
craft
style
of
beer
d
its
boston
lager
it
goes
down
super
easy
i
havent
had
this
in
a
while
probably
2
years
but
it
was
nice
to
return
to
it
again
its
tasty
pretty
well
balance
not
overly
complex
but
just
a
great
beer
to
have
in
the
evening
chilling
out
cooking
or
watching
tv
o
one
of
the
better
lagers
ive
had
probably
a
good
bunch
of
friends
over
beer
o
this
is
the
first
american
beer
i
had
after
living
in
germany
during
my
high
school
years
and
it
turned
me
on
to
american
craft
it
will
continue
to
have
a
place
in
my
fridge
overall
a
nice
lager
with
a
smooth
flavor
although
a
staple
in
the
craft
beer
world
i
had
it
years
ago
and
it
was
much
better
then
overall
as
ive
said
before
this
beer
is
refreshing
light
and
sold
pretty
much
everywhere
so
youre
guaranteed
to
be
able
to
lay
hands
on
it
when
jim
koch
started
making
this
beer
the
craft
brew
revolution
was
still
in
its
infancy
mr
koch
bucked
the
trends
and
got
this
beer
to
the
thirsty
masses
and
the
rest
was
history
its
not
shooting
off
fireworks
these
days
but
its
stuck
around
and
for
good
reason
3
0
o
good
session
beer
a
little
more
carbonated
that
i
would
have
liked
but
overall
quite
enjoyable
o
not
something
id
normally
order
but
at
a
lot
of
restaurants
this
is
the
best
they
have
it
goes
well
enough
with
most
food
and
makes
for
a
pretty
good
palate
cleanser
between
bites
this
got
me
into
craft
beer
and
i
still
enjoy
it
in
from
a
bottle
from
time
to
time
but
i
honestly
think
for
some
reason
it
seems
to
lose
a
little
flavor
on
tap
went
reasonably
well
with
mongolian
beef
from
the
local
chinese
though
and
felt
absolutely
no
guilt
whatsoever
for
sacrificing
its
edge
to
a
sustained
chilli
attack
overall
the
beer
was
rather
refreshing
but
not
very
imaginative
one
of
the
most
prevalent
beers
and
one
of
the
most
reliable
an
american
classic
did
someone
say
session
brew
here
it
is
easy
to
drink
but
not
lacking
in
taste
this
is
one
of
those
beers
that
i
should
turn
to
more
often
its
simple
yet
delicious
and
widely
available
at
a
reasonable
price
this
is
one
of
the
better
lagers
ive
had
feel
feels
good
you
can
take
big
chugs
and
it
isnt
flat
draft
is
the
same
im
surprised
to
see
that
its
considered
a
vienna
lager
like
a
mexican
beer
i
guess
id
have
called
it
an
amber
lager
anyway
you
can
never
go
wrong
but
i
usually
like
to
venture
further
overall
this
is
just
a
solid
lager
not
many
out
there
and
this
is
a
go
to
brew
when
stuck
with
macros
and
nothing
much
else
thanks
poured
from
a
bottle
into
a
12
ounce
mason
jar
a
vigorous
pour
resulted
in
a
nice
amount
of
foam
that
dies
down
and
produces
a
thin
layer
of
bubbles
and
residue
the
beer
is
a
warm
goldenamber
color
like
autumn
leaves
consistent
and
clear
theres
a
sweet
maltiness
to
the
nose
not
so
much
hops
as
malt
this
bears
out
on
the
palate
as
well
the
carbonation
is
there
and
theres
a
bit
of
caramel
that
hits
at
first
then
returns
in
the
finish
very
soft
balanced
and
inviting
i
am
feeling
kinda
like
the
guy
who
stopped
listening
to
his
favorite
band
because
it
became
too
popular
right
about
now
the
boston
lager
is
what
it
is
and
for
being
what
it
isand
being
so
widely
distributed
and
heavily
advertisedit
doesnt
disappoint
overal
its
a
good
beer
with
nice
malty
bready
taste
and
spicy
hops
without
a
lot
of
biterness
just
a
real
good
beer
you
know
you
can
count
on
that
being
said
ive
certainly
had
better
in
the
years
since
first
trying
it
i
never
buy
a
6
pack
of
it
however
i
do
buy
the
sam
mix
packs
so
i
return
to
this
classic
quite
often
overall
hey
if
im
in
a
place
that
only
has
macro
lagers
this
is
probably
what
im
getting
unless
they
have
sierra
nevada
its
a
great
entry
level
brew
that
isnt
necessarily
craft
but
it
is
definitely
a
crossover
into
getting
beer
drinkers
to
see
that
onedimensional
macro
lagers
cheat
them
out
of
respecting
their
beer
however
is
it
just
me
or
has
it
gotten
progressively
worse
as
sam
adams
has
produced
progressively
more
year
to
year
overall
pretty
much
the
gold
standard
for
its
style
good
amount
of
flavour
that
could
potentially
bring
in
drinkers
to
craft
its
crisp
and
drinks
well
what
more
could
you
ask
for
here
one
of
my
least
favourite
styles
here
done
well
enough
i
hope
this
gets
enough
attention
here
eventually
to
enter
chain
restaurants
for
an
alternative
to
light
macros
for
when
i
tag
along
for
after
work
brews
sam
adams
boston
lager
is
my
goto
beer
since
it
is
available
almost
everywhere
it
always
provides
a
nice
background
for
anything
else
im
doing
at
the
moment
one
of
my
favorites
poured
from
a
12
oz
bottle
into
a
mug
poured
a
nice
amber
color
with
a
slight
off
white
head
that
stuck
around
smell
is
heavy
on
hops
with
a
undertone
of
malt
mouthfeel
is
very
good
and
easy
to
drink
taste
is
very
much
like
the
smell
heavy
hops
with
malt
undertones
very
well
balanced
slight
bitterness
in
the
back
of
the
pallet
due
to
the
hops
but
its
a
good
bitterness
you
could
chug
these
theyre
so
good
o
a
very
flavorful
beer
for
a
lager
not
sure
how
they
got
away
with
calling
this
a
lager
really
im
sure
they
do
it
lager
style
but
it
seems
like
theyre
kind
of
breaking
the
rules
very
heavy
and
flavorful
for
the
style
and
quite
sessionable
this
is
certainly
a
complex
lager
i
would
say
its
right
in
line
with
something
like
a
blue
point
toasted
lager
o
one
of
the
best
flagship
beers
out
there
i
never
used
to
like
it
and
i
think
my
palate
has
changed
a
lot
over
the
years
damn
fine
daytoday
beer
and
absolutely
your
best
bet
if
the
only
other
thing
on
tap
is
bud
or
the
equivalent
boston
lager
is
sadly
the
best
choice
at
far
too
many
places
i
say
this
as
sierra
is
a
far
better
best
choice
but
sam
adams
has
really
gotten
their
name
out
i
will
say
this
is
by
far
their
flag
ship
and
is
better
than
most
of
their
other
options
a
great
beer
oh
god
far
from
it
but
im
always
happy
to
have
one
this
is
the
perfect
everyday
for
everyman
everyperson
for
the
politicaly
correct
brew
o
okay
i
first
reviewed
this
brew
a
few
years
back
with
pen
and
paper
but
i
wanted
to
try
the
sensory
glass
and
review
it
again
overall
this
brew
isnt
bad
its
not
great
either
imho
the
sensory
glass
looks
great
but
gave
me
the
same
experience
as
the
mug
ive
always
been
back
and
forth
with
sam
adams
brews
however
this
is
an
average
brew
if
you
are
into
this
style
and
want
something
with
a
speciality
glass
get
the
sam
adams
if
you
want
a
great
brew
in
this
style
get
the
glbc
eliot
ness
we
dont
have
tons
of
options
here
in
town
but
everywhere
i
go
that
has
boston
lager
6
packs
also
carry
glbc
eliot
ness
both
are
considered
vienna
style
lagers
both
are
around
the
same
price
dont
get
me
wrong
boston
lager
is
a
better
than
decent
beer
but
the
glbc
is
world
class
for
the
vienna
style
imo
that
is
mouth
feel
and
overall
much
better
than
the
last
time
i
remember
having
it
i
must
have
gotten
a
skunked
brew
on
my
last
tasting
light
crisp
and
enjoyable
o
believe
it
or
not
this
was
my
first
time
trying
this
american
classic
i
was
not
disappointed
this
is
a
well
made
beer
that
is
widely
distributed
it
is
a
good
goto
reliable
beer
in
a
place
with
limited
choices
served
in
a
sam
adams
glass
the
noble
hops
dominate
the
aroma
in
a
not
very
pleasant
way
the
hops
bite
in
the
smell
reminds
me
a
bit
of
bug
spray
thankfully
this
does
not
apply
to
the
taste
theres
a
faint
noble
hops
taste
with
a
little
malt
sweetness
and
not
a
whole
lot
else
mouthfeel
is
exceptional
i
could
see
sessioning
with
this
but
it
really
doesnt
stand
out
tastewise
it
feels
good
in
the
mouth
but
leaves
no
lasting
memories
on
the
taste
buds
o
a
good
solid
beer
easy
to
session
and
tasty
c
o
this
is
a
very
nicely
flavored
smooth
and
very
easy
to
drink
beer
the
flavor
lingers
well
on
the
palate
after
the
swallow
leaving
a
rich
and
fulfilling
satisfaction
this
is
a
really
good
everyday
beer
and
would
work
well
in
any
situation
plus
i
think
this
would
could
be
enjoyed
by
anyone
this
reminds
me
of
a
light
english
bitter
well
done
opened
this
bottle
819notched
for
519gonna
have
to
pay
more
attentionjust
purchased
this
bottle
appearance
was
very
goodnice
goldenorange
huealso
had
a
descent
frothy
foamy
top
truthfully
could
not
smell
much
of
anything
and
the
taste
was
also
disappointing
i
continually
tasted
a
bitter
floralhoneysweet
taste
that
lingered
no
matter
how
many
times
or
how
i
drank
this
beer
my
mouth
was
quite
dry
once
finishedand
i
found
i
needed
a
drink
of
water
im
sorry
to
say
it
will
be
a
while
before
trying
this
ever
again
great
tasting
beer
that
i
could
drink
in
large
quantities
the
aftertaste
is
refreshing
and
invites
you
to
have
another
definitely
my
goto
beer
when
in
airports
or
other
bars
with
limited
selections
you
can
usually
find
a
sam
adams
in
even
the
worst
of
places
a
great
lager
very
drinkable
it
has
an
aromatic
hop
character
that
puts
industrial
lagers
to
shame
the
only
negative
is
the
pervasive
hint
of
diacetyl
in
the
background
which
spoils
an
otherwise
fantastic
beer
in
any
case
a
must
try
for
all
beer
lovers
a
good
beer
much
better
than
the
average
beers
from
the
big
american
breweries
good
mouthfeel
and
highly
drinkable
just
a
good
beer
overall
it
reminds
me
most
of
sierra
nevada
pale
ale
for
good
or
bad
but
its
one
of
my
goto
beers
depending
on
what
bar
im
at
what
is
there
really
to
day
about
this
brew
its
what
really
got
me
into
craft
and
a
solid
offering
at
most
places
that
carry
only
bmc
it
sure
is
a
looked
with
a
nice
amber
color
and
fluffy
two
finger
head
smell
is
very
floral
and
inviting
nice
malt
profile
up
front
with
a
subtle
hop
flavor
that
comes
around
after
a
while
mouth
on
it
is
almost
perfect
for
the
style
and
is
velvety
smooth
all
the
way
down
overall
you
know
this
beer
and
probably
have
had
your
fair
share
but
its
always
welcome
in
my
home
overall
this
is
an
eminently
drinkable
finelybalanced
beer
in
many
ways
first
it
finds
a
nice
ratio
of
hops
to
malt
skimping
on
neither
but
also
neither
letting
the
flavors
get
out
of
hand
and
second
it
manages
to
find
a
nice
middleground
in
the
larger
panoply
of
beers
easily
staying
away
from
the
waterlike
qualities
of
say
anheuserbusch
but
avoiding
the
harsher
polarizing
palates
of
say
unibroue
yes
there
are
those
who
think
samuel
adams
doesnt
make
anything
decent
but
there
is
a
reason
why
their
beers
have
won
more
awards
than
any
beer
in
history
as
per
their
website

and
keep

lovers
dropping

happy
maybe
sam
adams
best
beer
and
great
for
anytime
of
the
year
o
forgot
how
much
i
enjoyed
this
beer
back
in
the
day
really
enjoy
it
though
i
could
do
without
that
odd
metal
finish
on
the
nose
o
its
a
lager
with
a
lot
of
flavor
and
it
goes
down
easy
and
enjoyably
o
i
really
dont
like
admitting
i
enjoy
anything
from
sam
adams
as
they
have
kind
of
gotten
too
big
and
too
old
for
my
tastes
but
this
is
a
solid
offering
from
them
if
its
the
only
craft
beer
choice
at
a
restaurant
id
go
for
it
o
good
beer
that
has
perfectly
blended
the
flavors
we
expect
in
our
craft
beers
with
the
light
body
and
availability
of
the
big
guys
well
after
not
having
it
for
a
few
years
i
still
like
it
a
lot
definitely
too
expensive
to
be
a
regular
over
more
local
options
but
it
was
a
great
option
when
i
had
no
idea
what
i
wanted
goes
with
most
foods
and
my
macrolovin
friends
will
drink
it
too
overall
not
a
bad
session
beer
at
all
quit
refreshing
less
hops
and
more
malts
would
really
even
this
beer
out
and
make
a
great
vienna
lager
as
it
stands
though
its
just
ok
o
average
nothing
special
in
any
way
i
guess
its
just
not
my
style
overall
great
beer
overall
has
the
perfect
blend
of
color
and
odor
mixed
with
the
taste
and
feel
to
make
this
a
classic
favorite
i
love
this
beer
and
it
is
one
of
my
alltime
favorites
an
okay
lager
not
great
not
bad
needs
more
complexity
to
the
flavor
something
beyond
toasted
malt
and
mildly
bitter
vegetable
hops
overall
this
is
a
solid
brew
that
can
be
had
on
a
budget
can
be
found
everywhere
in
the
u
s
and
is
often
a
lifesaver
at
bars
and
restaurants
where
the
only
other
choices
are
bmc
mouthfeel
is
crisp
like
a
pilsner
but
not
as
carbonated
alcohol
is
not
noticeable
as
expected
decent
beer
but
not
necessarily
a
personal
favorite
that
dirty
diacetyl
tapline
scent
is
the
one
thing
that
bothers
me
with
the
bbc
beers
although
a
gateway
beer
into
craft
for
venturers
o
a
simple
beer
but
a
good
offering
categorically
still
not
my
favorite
style
o
a
nice
lager
not
to
complex
just
clean
and
refreshing
o
its
pretty
well
balanced
albeit
a
little
on
the
hoppy
side
of
things
a
personal
favorite
of
mine
since
its
easier
to
drink
than
an
ipa
but
still
gives
me
the
hop
aroma
and
flavor
i
crave
i
guess
there
is
a
reason
this
beer
has
won
a
number
of
awards
well
done
jim
koch
and
the
boston
beer
co
no
wonder
this
is
your
groups
flag
ship
this
is
a
staple
lager
awesome
beer
great
to
have
at
a
bar
with
limited
taps
o
this
was
a
pretty
nice
beer
thirstquenching
straightforward
and
uncomplicated
would
definitely
buy
this
again
especially
for
a
warm
summer
day
sampled
this
again
over
the
weekend
poured
a
nice
fluffy
head
with
decent
retention
with
a
light
amber
color
sweet
malt
with
some
hops
balancing
it
out
a
little
bready
with
some
fruit
notes
medium
carbonation
and
light
to
medium
bodied
a
decent
offering
and
sessionable
for
me
although
i
am
not
a
lager
fan
o
probably
the
easiest
drinking
craft
beer
ive
had
next
to
sierra
nevada
pale
ale
i
have
and
will
continue
to
drink
this
on
a
very
regular
basis
compared
to
every
other
beer
in
the
world
its
not
much
of
a
contender
but
considering
that
a
lot
of
people
see
this
beer
as
the
transition
from
mass
market
adjunct
mainstream
big
beer
to
the
world
of
diverse
and
creative
microbrews
this
is
a
commendable
effort
regardless
sam
adams
has
a
much
deeper
portfolio
appearance
was
golden
yellow
with
an
inch
of
light
white
foam
that
faded
quickly
smell
was
not
great
lightly
grainy
somewhat
sweet
taste
was
cereal
grains
yeasty
something
that
played
at
hops
and
overall
completely
nondescript
and
generally
weak
overall
this
is
a
completely
middling
offering
drinkable
certainly
if
you
have
nothing
better
to
do
and
some
on
hand
boston
lager
resides
perhaps
two
steps
in
front
of
the
macro
macro
lagers
and
at
least
four
steps
behind
the
micros
o
sure
craft
brewers
including
bbc
have
made
other
mroe
exciting
lagers
this
is
still
a
good
beer
that
got
many
into
enjoying
quality
beer
i
have
tried
this
in
the
past
and
i
cant
get
into
it
ive
tried
approaching
this
beer
again
hoping
it
will
change
my
mind
its
not
a
complete
failure
its
just
boring
it
tastes
better
than
the
macro
lagers
but
thats
not
saying
much
overall
middle
of
the
road
but
enjoyable
and
one
that
will
do
no
problem
this
beer
is
one
of
the
more
balanced
brews
that
you
can
find
in
such
wide
availability
the
notes
here
are
slightly
toasted
malts
with
a
smooth
hop
bitterness
that
is
pronounced
but
not
at
all
overpowering
theres
a
slight
sweetness
that
nicely
balances
this
bitterness
the
beer
itself
feels
slippery
and
bubbly
to
the
tongue
and
not
heavy
at
all
the
result
is
a
very
drinkable
beer
that
is
tasty
enough
as
to
not
be
boring
the
first
micro
brew
i
ever
had
in
1984
the
best
part
it
hasnt
changed
old
faithful
color
a
nice
light
caramel
smell
not
a
highlight
or
praise
worthy
but
not
unpleasant
taste
a
nice
balance
here
a
bit
sweet
with
caramel
notes
finishing
with
a
light
hoppiness
mouthfeel
easy
and
smooth
nothing
harsh
thats
what
makes
a
truely
good
beer
luckily
its
accessible
almost
anywhere
because
everyone
has
been
to
places
where
you
have
six
taps
and
five
are
bud
and
or
miller
products
then
this
ill
take
this
anyday
its
a
very
good
lager
that
is
both
malty
and
filled
with
hop
flavor
its
not
something
i
would
seek
out
but
its
great
to
see
a
good
flavorful
beer
that
is
so
widely
available
i
first
want
to
start
out
by
saying
that
many
great
beer
companies
put
out
much
better
product
and
dont
pump
their
advertisement
every
couple
of
minutes
because
they
dont
need
to
the
product
sells
it
self
i
maybe
a
bit
bias
on
this
review
because
i
had
been
putting
off
trying
it
for
so
long
but
you
can
only
go
to
your
local
store
so
many
times
and
buy
the
greats
before
you
need
to
branch
out
after
feeling
a
little
bold
i
picked
up
a
sixer
with
my
buddy
this
brew
pours
clear
amber
colorlet
me
quickly
say
that
it
looks
darker
on
tv
haha
small
bit
of
froth
no
lacing
smells
sweet
malty
i
taste
some
caramel
in
the
body
sweet
and
simple
but
balanced
just
like
the
commercials
say
in
the
mouth
it
feels
like
a
bit
like
soda
not
bad
for
what
it
is
but
it
is
way
over
priced
i
dont
feel
like
this
should
be
the
work
horse
for
any
beer
company
but
thats
my
opinion
overall
its
a
damn
fine
beer
but
considerably
better
when
its
on
tap
and
youve
got
plenty
of
time
to
kill
between
flights
d
an
american
craft
classic
for
a
reason
well
made
and
very
quenchable
a
very
solid
beer
in
my
opinion
definitely
give
it
a
try
great
american
beer
standard
that
can
be
found
pretty
much
coast
to
coast
pours
a
clear
honeyamber
color
with
a
small
white
head
that
typically
retains
and
laces
well
pretty
good
balance
of
sweet
malts
and
hop
bitterness
the
same
can
be
said
about
the
taste
with
a
nice
malty
profile
to
start
followed
by
a
distinct
but
nonthreatening
hop
bitterness
lightmedium
mouthfeel
and
very
drinkable
d
not
bad
for
what
it
is
but
the
price
seems
a
bit
high
i
have
several
friends
who
love
this
beer
and
occasionally
ill
partake
in
one
of
theirs
but
i
doubt
i
would
ever
purchase
any
o
such
a
nice
lagerone
of
the
best
american
versions
out
there
some
discernible
hops
and
yet
quite
balanced
o
nice
tasting
lager
that
is
more
flavorful
than
most
overallgreat
beer
even
when
consumed
out
of
a
margarita
glass
i
think
with
this
new
joint
opening
up
by
my
apartmentwork
i
will
be
drinking
alot
more
boston
lagers
d
hard
to
judge
something
i
happily
had
hundreds
of
times
without
thinking
of
it
good
beer
if
a
little
uneventful
for
a
beer
that
you
can
get
at
around
1
each
not
bad
at
all
o
awesome
all
around
lager
the
best
part
is
how
readily
available
this
is
o
a
flagship
a
star
a
staple
in
the
craft
world
i
dont
really
like
it
though
it
may
be
the
1
offering
of
the
1
craft
brewery
in
the
country
but
then
again
the
1
beer
in
america
is
bud
light
ill
stick
to
my
guns
and
leave
this
as
something
of
a
lastresort
goto
as
i
know
it
will
almost
always
be
available
i
try
a
lot
of
different
beers
but
i
regularly
find
myself
coming
back
to
good
ol
boston
lager
bl
has
a
very
robust
taste
especially
for
a
brewery
with
this
big
of
an
output
it
always
finishes
nice
and
never
leaves
a
bad
aftertaste
i
will
continue
to
hold
this
one
high
on
my
list
there
are
other
beers
that
i
like
better
and
would
rather
have
on
most
occasions
but
this
one
is
always
a
good
go
to
solid
i
just
have
to
review
this
one
because
it
has
been
a
little
overlooked
in
my
beer
travels
make
no
mistake
this
is
one
of
the
best
beers
in
the
world
malty
perfectly
balanced
on
the
sweet
side
with
a
toasty
slight
hint
of
bitter
and
i
always
have
a
bottle
or
six
in
my
fridge
o
pretty
great
this
is
the
third
time
ive
sa
boston
lager
but
the
first
time
reviewing
reviewing
it
gave
me
a
new
appreciation
for
this
beer
it
is
refreshing
and
pleasant
and
not
bitter
a
definite
favorite
of
mine
not
to
take
anything
away
from
this
beer
and
maybe
the
comparison
isnt
fair
but
as
good
as
this
beer
is
and
it
is
great
i
think
sa
noble
pils
is
better
t
this
is
pretty
well
balanced
very
clean
with
caramel
malt
upfront
and
a
slight
bit
of
hops
hidden
in
the
back
theres
a
faint
breadiness
on
the
finish
o
theres
a
reason
this
is
a
great
gateway
to
craft
beer
its
approachable
for
bmc
drinkers
and
substantial
enough
for
seasoned
craft
fans
havent
had
the
original
lager
in
many
years
got
2
in
a
summer
sampler
pack
even
after
all
the
craft
beers
and
crazy
hopped
ipas
ive
had
recently
this
beer
is
still
a
good
go
to
lager
with
enough
flavor
to
satify
most
of
the
bas
if
anyone
is
in
the
mood
for
a
good
lager
dont
forget
the
original
that
started
it
all
it
holds
up
the
test
of
time
with
the
best
of
them
o
a
well
done
lager
which
i
dont
drink
a
ton
of
but
bbc
does
a
great
job
with
their
flagship
beer
a
solid
go
to
at
a
restaurant
with
bmc
offerings
o
a
nice
alternative
to
the
generic
pale
lagers
out
there
not
a
bad
beer
the
only
thing
keeping
me
from
rating
it
higher
is
the
amount
of
hops
i
prefer
a
little
less
hops
is
my
beer
still
a
pretty
solid
beer
and
if
you
like
something
with
a
nice
hop
bit
but
not
to
the
extent
of
an
ipa
this
is
a
good
choice
still
a
good
lager
as
it
has
more
bitterness
than
expected
the
boston
lager
its
a
classic
brew
the
beer
has
an
attractive
mahogany
color
with
a
light
tan
head
on
it
the
head
settles
but
still
leave
a
decent
lacing
the
aroma
has
a
nice
balance
of
hops
and
malts
the
taste
is
hoppy
which
i
like
its
got
enough
malt
to
keep
it
in
the
lager
category
the
mouthfeel
has
a
bit
of
a
stinging
sensation
on
the
tongue
overall
its
a
great
beer
to
drink
and
enjoy
with
several
friends
prost
o
very
nice
i
used
to
think
this
beer
was
way
too
bitter
in
my
mgd
days
but
now
it
is
quite
mild
still
a
nice
solid
beer
that
i
would
drink
anytime
not
quite
on
par
with
great
lakes
en
vienna
but
good
tasting
and
will
buy
when
on
sale
nice
not
a
must
have
overall
a
very
quality
lager
from
samuel
adams
being
my
first
offering
from
them
i
was
very
pleasantly
surprised
i
was
expecting
it
to
be
just
like
any
other
macro
beer
out
there
although
i
had
my
doubts
once
i
got
a
first
whiff
of
it
but
the
taste
very
quickly
changed
that
and
out
did
my
expectations
miles
above
and
beyond
your
average
macro
lager
definitely
worth
a
try
happy
i
tried
this
one
to
be
honest
o
better
than
i
expected
it
has
been
many
years
since
i
had
this
i
remember
it
being
really
good
will
return
to
it
again
and
reassess
but
it
seems
like
the
beginning
of
a
really
good
beer
that
just
stops
midstride
the
best
american
beer
i
have
tried
beautiful
colour
and
an
awesome
smell
i
liked
the
touch
of
fruits
the
taste
is
also
good
elaborate
and
the
mouthfeel
is
great
it
is
refreshing
and
at
the
same
time
complex
this
next
summer
i
will
try
to
have
some
maine
microbrews
hopefully
as
good
as
this
beer
overall
this
is
a
nice
beer
that
would
be
a
little
better
for
me
if
it
were
less
bubbly
in
that
department
it
resembles
a
bud
light
or
something
that
claims
drinkability
but
ruins
it
with
gasinducing
bubbles
if
that
were
cut
down
youd
have
a
very
good
beer
in
my
mind
as
is
its
merely
good
overall
a
great
beer
that
exceeded
my
expectations
will
definitely
come
back
to
this
and
it
may
even
become
a
regular
o
theres
nothing
bad
about
this
beer
but
then
theres
nothing
compelling
about
it
either
however
the
glass
does
empty
pretty
quickly
nice
golden
color
one
finger
of
head
with
little
lacing
smelll
and
taste
are
the
same
sweet
malts
followed
by
hops
mouthfeel
is
smooth
with
just
enough
carbonation
to
tickle
my
tongue
overall
a
good
beer
i
cant
believe
i
only
drink
this
once
a
year
the
taste
is
hoppier
than
most
lagers
but
not
enough
to
stray
from
the
style
nor
turn
away
those
not
quite
accustomed
to
hops
some
slightly
toasty
malts
round
out
the
flavor
and
put
a
nice
bow
on
the
whole
experience
theres
a
lightness
and
refreshing
quality
to
the
mouthfeel
and
the
crispness
of
the
hops
but
it
still
remains
fullbodied
and
pleasant
best
when
fresh
of
course
but
great
for
any
season
its
just
one
of
those
great
beers
that
got
so
many
people
into
beer
that
has
quality
ingredients
and
better
taste
than
most
macros
despite
how
big
bbc
gets
this
is
certainly
one
of
my
goto
beers
still
and
unless
the
recipe
changes
dramatically
it
will
most
likely
remain
so
o
boston
lager
is
a
relatively
simple
brew
its
easy
to
drink
and
appropriate
for
various
occasions
and
food
pairingsjust
a
good
everyday
beer
o
this
is
the
first
craft
beer
i
had
even
before
i
knew
it
was
craft
beer
still
holds
up
as
nice
widely
available
beer
even
if
a
place
has
a
poor
to
mediocre
beer
selection
i
can
usually
bank
on
boston
lager
to
be
there
became
my
go
to
beer
towards
the
end
of
college
overall
drinkability
reasonably
enjoyable
especially
for
the
style
ill
be
sure
to
give
this
one
a
second
chance
when
i
get
a
fresher
bottle
o
bought
a
6
pack
of
these
for
our
bbq
and
before
i
knew
it
i
drank
them
all
very
easy
to
drink
easy
to
find
low
abv
and
easy
on
the
wallet
surprised
i
waited
this
long
to
have
one
the
taste
was
up
front
semisweet
malts
tuning
into
a
great
bitterness
after
the
drink
very
much
reminds
me
of
almost
a
semisweet
chocolate
i
was
washing
down
german
food
with
this
and
it
stood
up
to
the
vinegary
kraut
perfectly
o
pretty
decent
beer
that
you
can
find
everywhere
o
a
boston
classic
great
beer
for
anytime
of
the
year
or
day
nice
job
with
this
one
boston
beer
co
i
recently
learned
about
the
special
sam
adams
glasses
i
highly
recommend
them
the
aroma
of
the
boston
lager
is
excellent
a
rich
full
beer
experience
which
makes
the
flavor
taste
more
full
the
mouthfeel
is
great
a
crisp
effervescence
escapes
on
the
tongue
with
each
drink
the
color
shines
in
the
classic
amber
hue
while
the
word
standard
may
have
taken
on
the
association
of
average
but
i
prefer
the
sa
seasonals
over
the
boston
lager
any
day
of
the
week
as
far
as
american
lagers
go
though
hell
what
can
i
say
always
my
go
to
beer
and
will
drink
it
anytime

i
would
drink
this
beer
anytime
coating
the
mouth
just
the
right
amount
thick
white
foamy
head
that
slowly
recedes
as
the
beer
sits
a
malty
aroma
with
the
slightest
hint
of
hops
on
deeper
inspection
the
beer
gives
you
a
maltycaramel
sweet
flavor
with
very
slightly
bitter
hops
right
behind
it
for
balance
this
is
usually
it
nothing
that
offends
and
it
tastes
great
i
feel
it
is
much
better

with

all

a

thoughts
i
think
this
review
serves
this
beer
a
bit
better
then
the
last
one
did
id
still
recommend
it
and
some
thin
lacing
smells
of
thin
malt
and
some
floral
hops
the
malt
profile
isnt
as
pale
as
youd
expect
theres
some
caramel
flavors
hiding
in
there
maybe
slightly
biscuity
sharp
carbonation
and
a
decent
amount
of
bitter
hops
cleans
the
palate
not
a
bad
beer
and
its
available
almost

it

when
i
go
out
and
the
bar
does
not
carry
a
great
selection
of
beers
this
is
an
old
reliable
i
have
never
loved
this
beer
it
has
the
bitterness
of
hops
but
not
all
of
the
flavor
benefits
however
it
still
is
a
go
to
beer
in
a
bad
beer
situation
still
has
that
soft
spot
however
and
all
things
considered
an
important
beer
drinkability
is
by
far
the
best
ive
had
in
a
sam
adams
yet
easy
to
drink
and
pairs
well
in
all
fairness
this
is
a
good
beer
hopefully
ill
find
more
of
sams
that
are
like
this

good
beer
i
have
enjoyed
this
beer
for
years
and
will
continue
to
enjoy
for

come
would
like
to
see
them
add
an
additional
holiday
beer
to
the
sample

pack
and
leave
this
one
out
this
is
what
i
get
at
bars
that
dont
cater
to
beer
dorks
a
pleasantly
tasty
example
of
the
prototypical
gateway
craft
beer
and
a
lager
to
boot
which
is
infinitely
more
challenging
a
prospect
fully
satisfying
a
little
zingy
and
worthy
of
its
lore
in
american
brewing
circles
now
wheres
that
clam

im
suddenly
craving

imho
an
above

on

alone
id
call

faithful
you
know

what
youll

is

i

the
best
beers
to
have
with
a
meal
as
well
o
overall
it
seems
things
have
changed
visually
and
aromatically
this
is
still
a
good
beer
sweeter
then
i
remember
flavor
wise
toasty
and
crisp
still
easy
to
consume
refreshing
and
holds
a
special
place
in

not

whats
going

decent
starter
sam
adams
boston
lager
is
my
fall
back
beer
when
im
dont
feel
like
takin
a
chance
it
pours
a
deep
copper
color
with
fairly
substantial
white
head
you
can
smell
flowery
hops
and
carmely
malt
there
are
well
balanced
spicy
hop
to
malt
ratio
with
a
light
to
medium
mouthfeel
this
is
a
highly
drinkable
beer
i
would
have
to
put
it
on
my
list
of
desert
island
beers
along
with
sierra
nevada
pale
ale
and
a
few
others
a
well
balanced
lager
with
nice
hopiness
i
would
agree
with
the
other
posts
that
it
has
an
impressive
quality
for
such
a
mass
produced
readily
available
beer
i
would
really
like
to
try
more
of
their
beers
but
here
only
the
lager
cream
stout
cherry
wheat
and
seasonal
offerings
are
available
such
as
octoberfest
winter
lager
summer
ale
and
i
think
thats
it
drinkability
samuel
adams
flagship
beer
is
leaps
and
bounds
ahead
of
other
massproduced
american
beers
drinkable
but
still
full
of
flavor
and
highly
enjoyable
good
hop
flavor
in
a
lager
especially
one
so
common
taste
mouthfeel
opens
with
semisweet
toasted
malt
flavors
flowery
hops
citrus
zest
and
hints
of
honey
biscuity
dryness
takes
over
soon
after
with
fairly
mild
but
pleasant
bittering
hops
following
its
amusing
to
think
that
i
found
this
beer
intensely
bitter
only
four
years
ago
an
undertone
of
caramel
appears
midfinish
balancing
the
bitterness
to
create
a
wonderfully
smooth
aftertaste
an
exceptionally
good
session
beer
all
in
all
perfectly
balanced
but
complex
enough
to
remain
interesting
after
a
few
pints
drinkability
could
be
a
good
session
beer
for
some
although
id
rather
have
just
one
at
a
time
probably
one
of
the
best
beers
in
its
class
but
i
find
other
sam
adams
beers
to
be
better
drinkability
the
cereal
grain
taste
starts
to
wear
on
your
as
you
drink
it
and
the
hop
bite
isnt
as
clean
as
it
could
be
but
its
not
too
bad
for
a
lager
this
is
a
very
easy
to
drink
beer
what
i
think
is
one
of
the
better
lagers
out
there
d
high
this
is
a
great
american
lager
i
really
enjoy
this
one
as
an
everyday
beer

im

nice
to

basis
since
most
of
the
time
i
drink
it
by
the
pint
and
grumble
that
the
bar
has
nothing
better
to
offer
perspective
is
everything
but
this
beer
will
always
have
a
place
in

are

has
an

sweetness
that

in
a
bar
with
a
poor
beer
choice
then
i
can
always
at
least
hope
they
have
this
beer
it
is
very
easy
to
drink
i
love
the
amount
of
hops
in
it
not
too
much
or
too
little
ok
now
that
i
have
that
out
of
my
system
sam
adams
you
are
good
especially
with
how
you
make
your
holiday
porters
and
stouts
it
is
what
i
look
forward
to
every
winter
thanks
the
color
was
a
rich
reddish
copper
with
plenty
of
tan
creamy
head
i
was
impressed
by
the
head
retention
because
it
was
on
tap
most
beers
dont
retain
the
head
character
like
this
one
smells
like
hops
and
caramel
malts
wow
the
hops
come
through
i
liked
this
lager
it
has
the
flavor
of
an
ipa
but
this
is
definitely
a
lager
this
is
a
unique
beer
with
complex
aftertones
and
very
drinkable
its
hard
to
find
anything
wrong
with
this
beer
great
session
beer
that
is
always
consistent
this
beer
is
easy
to
find
even
in
rural
indiana
i
always
come
back
to
it
dgood
drinkability
its
a
clean
and
relatively
refreshing
lager
beer
wont
fatigue
ones
tastebuds
and
ill
be
drinking
more
of
this
beer
in
the
future
overall
this
is
a
very
easydrinking
beer
and
a
good
choice
if
youre
in
for
the
long
haul
which
is
where
ill
be
sept
5
of
2009
an
allaround
good
beer
this
is
actually
one
of
my
least
favorite
sam
adams
brew
it
pours
a
medium
brown
with
a
decent
head
but
i
just
do
not
like
the
taste
it
has
a
bitter
aftertaste
that
just
stays
with
you
i
like
sam
adams
but
this
is
one
of
my
least
favorites
by
them
i
would
drink
their
light
before
this
still
if
theres
a
better
amber
lager
out
there
i
havent
found
it
yet
the
mouthfeel
and
drinkability
are
good
there
are
tons
of
beers
i
would
rather
have
and
perhaps
just
as
many
i
would
rank
below
this
lager
again
when
in
a
sea
of
doo
doo
here
is
your
life
preserver
light
amber
color
head
isnt
much
to
speak
about
but
the
thin
cap
trails
some
nice
lace
smell
of
toasted
malt
and
some
light
floral
hops
taste
is
pleasant
enough
nice
maltyness
with
hops
for
balance
overall
a
nice
brew
i
bought
a
case
of
this
for
some
non
beer
enlightened
guest
who
would
never
drink
my
normal
beers
it
fit
the
bill
perfectly
not
too
bold
for
the
bmc
drinkers
but
enough
flavor
to
satisy
the
craft
beer
drinker
also
a
good
fallback
in
many
barsrestaurants
that
dont
carry
good
beer
i
could
honestly
drink
this
beer
all
day
and
have
on
several
occasions
it
reminds
me
of
the
past
and
times
forgotten
i
can
remember
being
at
usma
and
drinking
this
delicious
beer
at
the
officers
club
while
watching
the
red
sox
on
the
corner
tv
i
can
remember
drinking
this
beer
at
christmas
with
my
dad
i
can
remember
giving
this
beer
to
so
many
friends
in
an
effort
to
convert
them
to
real
beer
oh
how
this
beer
is
a
tasty
memory
t
tastes
pick
up
a
good
balance
of
high
hop
with
a
malty
aftertaste
and
a
slight
citrus
taste
that
lingers
di
could
definitely
knock
back
a
few
easily
great
session
beer
in
my
honest
opinion
drinkability
easy
to
drink
if
you
prefer
this
style
defintley
a
good
choice
at
a
bar
to
have
something
different
then
all
these
nasty
bud
light
and
coors
products
perfect
balancing
from
the
appearance
taste
and
drinkability
kudos
to
jim
koch
for
making
boston
lager
a
true
american
beer
we
can
be
proud
of
theres
definately
some
fun
complexity
in
the
flavor
more
hops
than
average
id
say
theres
the
grainy
and
the
malty
but
its
well
balanced
with
the
bitterness
this
was
the
first
beer
i
ever
had
when
i
started
drinking
beer
4
years
ago
always
has
been
a
favorite
my
second
favorite
lager
in
the
world
behind
brooklyn
since
its
not
as
available
sammy
has
been
my
go
to
beer
d
definitely
a
session
beer
without
a
doubt
d
easy
to
find
this
as
its
everywhere
and
a
good
session
beer
i
have
always
enjoyed
sa
i
have
yet
to
rate
it
but
it
is
one
of
the
very
best
high
productions
around
di
can
drink
this
beer
all
day
long
at
less
than
5
makes
this
beer
such
a
great
session
beer
with
a
great
amount
of
flavors
not
a
bad
price
either
just
over
20
bucks
for
a
casecount
me
in
baby
pours
a
ambergolden
color
nice
head
with
lots
of
nice
lacing
smells
to
me
like
a
lot
of
bread
smell
not
too
much
going
on
there
drinkability
is
great
this
beer
is
everything
i
want
from
a
lager
not
a
lot
going
on
with
this
beer
but
it
is
a
very
good
lager
that
goes
down
quite
nice
i
could
drink
a
lot
of
these
medium
carbonation
that
made
this
highly
drinkable
this
was
an
ok
brew
i
know
this
is
the
anchor
of
the
brewery
but
they
put
out
so
many
more
good
brews
this
is
better
than
most
mainstream
lagers
but
ill
get
something
better
in
the
future
the
appearance
is
the
best
thing
about
this
beer
amber
colored
with
a
decent
head
no
aroma
to
speak
of
maybe
a
bit
of
malt
but
not
much
taste
is
a
metallic
slightly
malty
flavor
but
just
not
much
going
on
this
beer
is
maybe
half
a
notch
better
than
budmillercoors
but
thats
about
all
i
can
say
that
is
positive
this
is
exactly
what
i
look
for
in
a
lager
not
weak
you
can
taste
the
hops
and
the
finish
is
dry
when
i
go
out
to
eat
and
i
want
a
beer
to
go
with
my
food
this
is
what
i
want
not
some
metallic
watery
beer
that
just
doesnt
satisfy
i
like
this
beer
a
lot
and
will
keep
this
in
my
frig
since
its
so
easy
to
get
poured
into
a
chilled
lager
glass
they
only
had
chilled
so
i
waited
until
the
beer
warmed
up
poured
a
deep
amber
with
decent
head
smell
was
light
floral
hops
mixed
with
subtle
malts
taste
is
why
i
reviewed
this
i
had
been
drinking
budweiser
all
morning
so
this
was
beyond
refeshing
the
hops
really
stuck
out
and
were
quite
floral
i
believe
the
keg
was
freshly
tapped
gentle
carbonation
overall
i
could
session
these
all
day
long
3
5
m4
d
wellbalanced
lager
with
a
soft
malty
mouthfeel
throughout
though
it
could
gain
more
assertive
flavours
from
larger
quantities
of
dark
malts
perhaps
anyway
its
a
refreshing
lager
and
a
solid
brew
by
all
means
ive
enjoyed
this
beer
for
years
but
only
thought
to
review
it
recently
always
a
pleasant
and
easy
to
drink
lager
all
in
all
this
is
a
great
beer
truly
an
american
classic
i
hope
they
dont
change
a
thing
about
it
in
my
life
time
taste
is
not
very
ballanced
plenty
of
hops
in
these
hop
shortage
times
but
i
dont
taste
anything
to
back
it
up
not
much
grain
yeast
or
malt
behind
it
this
beer
has
a
little
carbonated
bite
best
served
cold
from
a
tap
when
i
cant
find
a
decent
alternative
like
many
this
beer
was
my
first
into
the
craft
beer
world
and
i
still
love
drinking
it
to
this
day
the
caramel
undertones
in
the
taste
and
the
overall
appearance
and
drinkability
make
this
one
a
big
winner
for
me
available
anywhere
at
usually
about

a
beer
its
even
at
almost
any
bar
youll
come
across

boston
lager
is
a
wellmade
beer
that
is
a
decent
stepping
stone
up
from
the
macros
not
my
favorite
style
or
flavor
profile
but
ill
have
it
from
time
to
time
poured
into
a
12
oz
glass
nice
head
with
average
staying
power
color
a
nice
goldcopperamber
but
lacks
the
metallic
looking
edge
that
some
beers
have
being
more
like
a
burnished
wood
than
a
polished
metal
the
smell
is
of
citrusy
hops
and
light
to
medium
malt
notes
that
come
through
on
the
flavor
with
grapefruit
notes
and
a
quickly
fading
malt
taste
with
dry
citrusy
finish
ive
always
liked
this
brew
with
seafood
cheers
d
ahh
here
is
where
the
rubber
meets
the
road
this
beer
has
some
lace
it
has
some
taste
it
has
a
name
at
least
in
america
with
sam
adams
it
has
just
enough
taste
to
make
it
a
very
good
session

bottle

weve
come

love

the
taste
ios
light
toffee
with

a
light
pine

builds
toward

the
finish
is

its
crisp
yet
fairly
tasty
smooth
and
easy
to
drink
but
doesnt
have
that
much
too
it
d
very
drinkable
beer
and
highjly
sessionable
i
dont
know
why
others
dont
hop
up
their
lagers
as
this
one
has
everything
they
do
not
well
balanced
and
well
crafted
pours
a
copper
brown
with
about
a
14
inch
head
the
beer
smells
of
sweet
malts
and
hops
the
taste
is
a
good
balance
of
hops
and
malts
sweet
initially
followed
by
the
bitterness
of
the
hops
the
mouth
feel
is
surprisingly
balanced
good
combination
of
hop
bitterness
and
malt
this
is
a
very
drinkable
beer
defiantly
one
i
could
have
more
than
one
of
i
have
found
that
the
flavor
of
the
beer
is
better
as
it
warms
this
is
a
good
fall
back
beer
that
can
be
found
almost
anywhere
in
the
northeast
taste
is
great
its
been
a
long
time
since
ive
had
this
beer
and
forgot
how
good
it
is
a
lot
of
hops
but
not
a
punch
in
the
face
even
maltyness
a
great
balanced
beer
why
dont
i
drink
this
more
its
not
a
blow
your
socks
off
beer
but
it
is
just
really
good
this
is
imo
the
best
commercial
american
lager
available
when
i
first
had
it
years
ago
i
was
much
less
experienced
with
beers
and
couldnt
stand
it
because
all
i
had
been
drinking
was
american
lagers
since
then
ive
been
able
to
expand
my
palate
significantly
and
have
come
to
appreciate
this
for
what
it
is
a
strong
fullbodied
lager
that
does
a
great
job
of
balancing
the
hops
and
the
malt
my
favorite
and
oldreliable
if
im
in
a
bar
or
restaurant
where
no
craft
or
imports
can
be

of

in

in

it
seems
to
be
a
standard
beer
at
the
pubs
which
is
not
a
real
beer
pub
but
enjoyed
this
enough
to
get
it

wont

the
first
time
i
tried
this
and
how
i
was
blown
away
by
it
it
truly
redefined
to
me
what
a
lager
beer
can
be
its
so
lively

flavorful
like

i
enjoy

not
what
i
want
now
had
this
one
at

in

and
all

helped
this
go
down
quite

but
the
bitterness
is
still
there
a
bit
at
teh
end
the
mouthfeel
is
a
bit
heavy
but
rather
familiarity
if
you
havent
tried
it
and
live
in
the
us
well
balanced
out
by
the
malts
and
thus
the
lacing
on
the
glass
is
perfect
the
flavor
is
bold
enough
not
when
a
mediocre
batch
is
mixed
in
with
the
good
for
an
american
lager
this
beer
has
a
great
hop
aroma
that
isnt
found
anywhere
else
for
a
beer
this
widely
distributed
i
love
the
amber
color
the
taste
continues
the
hop
theme
though
the
malts
make
a
balanced
and
tasty
appearance
this
is
simply
a
good
lager
and
one

i
am

theres
not

else
to

nothing
stands
out
in

taste
aside
from
a
slightly
hop
bite
finishing
things
out
that
fades
malts
dont
have
the
caramel
taste
that
i
found
in
the
nose
mouthfeel
is
light
as
expected
and
this
brew
is
extremely
drinkable
its
a
good
tail
gating
go
to
beer
i
rarely
buy
this
in
bottles
its
available
everywhere
and
makes
for
a
good
fallback
brew
when
some
of
the
more
craft
types
are
unavailable
the

my

offering
from
them

but
this
is
the
first
samuel
adams
that
i
got
to
try
out
of
them
i
am
aware
that
this
was
not
a
scientific
test
but
damn
this
was
the
best
tasting
samuel
adams
boston
lager
that
ive
ever
had
thedragontonyjun
08
if
this
is
the
best
beer
in
america
then
i
must
be
heterodox
and
say
it
is
not
ontap
at
fridays
same
old
goodness
from
draft
as
the
bottle
except
a
touch
better
with
the
mouthfeel
sometimes
i
think
i
overlook
how
good
this
stuff
is
as
im
trying
different
kinds
of
beer
a
good
decision
when
restaurants
have
a
limited
tap
selection
but
its
at
its
very
best
when
coming
from
draft
at
a
boston
bar
as
its
overall
flavor
is
much
sweeter
and
carameley
d
i
love
this
beer
it
is
good
for
any
occasion
and
it
is
becoming
available
almost
anywhere
i
go
i
will
defiantly
be
seeing
more
this
beer
in
the
future
overall
this
is
a
mighty
fine
beer
as
far
as
sam
adams
beers
go
this
is
not
my
favorite
but
again
it
is
a
good
beer
theres
just
something
about
the
way
they
brew
their
beer
that
gets
you
really
nicely
buzzed
if
you
like
lagers
then
this
is
the
way
to
go
if
youre
in
a
supermarket
in
a
small
liqour
store
you
might
a
bit
more
selection
depending
on
the
season
for
the
sas
that
are
year
round
this
is
an
overall
good
one
if
you
prefer
lagers
like
myself
if
youre
into
ales
theres
always
the
boston
ale
but
thats
another
review
draft
in

a
darker

color
with
a
thick
foamy
lasting
head
light
lacing
aroma
is
fairly
faint
consists
of
caramel

a
fairly
sweet

scent

of
malts
and
a
bit
of
light
citrus
body
is
light
to
medium
with
a
heavy
dose
of
carbonation
leaves
a
bit
of
a
hoppy
aftertaste
that
is
not

during
initial
consumption

good

nothing

pretty
malty
and
just
a
hint

added
to
this
creation
as
well
taste

i
can
taste
a
bit
of
bread
and
also
some
roasted
barley
and
malt
in
the
mix
also
a

makes

quite

the
flagship
of
the

brand
is

the
fact
that
you
can
find

body

character
than

out

to
really
give

think
about
why
some

think
the
main
thing
to
say
about
this
beer
is
that
it
is
good
ive
had
a
limited
number
of
vienna
lagers
but
this
one
did
not
miss
the
mark
you
get
sweet
caramel
as
expected
and
a
small
but
pleasant
hop
bite
in
the
couple
times
ive
had
this
on
tap
and
a
bit
of
sweetness
its
too
bad
you
cant
find
this
in
a
plentiful
amount
in
seattle
or
i
think
id
buy
it
often
light
carbonation
tantalizes
and

great

in
my
opinion

notes
this
beer
is
great
at
normal
beer
temperature
but
it
is
also
very
refreshing
at
ice
temp
reminds
me
of
brooklyn
lager
in
some
ways
but
i
prefer
the
brooklyn
version
drinkability
an
excellent
beer
that
you
can
find
anywhere
i
would
say
spend
the
extra
money
for
this
instead
of
getting
a
watery
six
pack
of
bud
or
miller
keep
up
the
good
work
samuel
admas
ut
vivat
crescat
floreat
i
just
picked
up
a
6pack
of
this
at
kroger
when
i
was
grocery
shopping
and
i
thought
what
the
heck
ill
try
this
everyone
i
know
doesnt
like
sam
adams
but
they
all
drink
cheap
american
beerflavored
seltzer
water
i
cant
knock
it
if
i
aint
payin
for
it
though
anyway
i
opened
the
bottle
and
sniffed
the
beer
it
has
a
sweet
flowery
aroma
and
i
then
poured
a
little
into
a
clear
glass
it
pours
a
reddishamber
type
color
with
a
brownish
head
that
stayed
there
for
a
long
while
i
then
tasted
it
wow
my
relatives
were
wrong
i
liked
the
mellow
sweet
taste
of
sam
adams
the
taste
was
kinda
nutty
in
the
middle
of
the
sip
and
left
a
clean
crisp
bite
at
the
end
of
it
and
the
aftertaste
was
a
little
hoppy
then
mellowed
a
bit
this
beer
is
underrated
taking
a
backseat
to
the
big
three
however
i
think
i
might
get
me
another
one
or
five
ill
definitely
recommend
this
gem
and
i
will
be
buying
this
one
again
pours
a
light
golden
orange
with
a
big
white
forthy
head
that
sticks
around
all
the
way
to
the
bottom
of
the
glass
nose
is
mainly
of
carmael
malts
just
a
tiny
hint
of
hops
taste
is
pleasantly
malty
gently
hops
finish
pretty
well
balanced
medium
bodied
and
a
little
creamy
this
is
a
solid
fallback
beer
than
is
becoming
nearly
as
ubiquitous
as
the
big
3
well
im
not
sure
i
can
do
this
beer
justice
it
is
a
staple
well
when
i
have
money
it
pours
a
nice
orangeyamber
with
a
nice
creamy
head
the
smell
is
sweet
and
crazy
floral
hoppy
anotherwords
it
smells
great
the
taste
includes
a
nice
balance
of
hops
and
malts
normally
on
tap
tit
has
more
of
a
nuttywheaty
taste
to
it
but
this
time
it
was
a
blast
of
hops
everyone
knows
about
this
beer
and
it
kicks
ass
note
do
not
be
a
dumbass
and
chug
it
then
barf
it
into
a
flower
pot
drinkability
it
is
probably
the
best
u
s
macro
lager
available
on
the
market
and
it
doesnt
use
adjunct
what
a
wellbalanced
and
tasty
lager
some
people
might
not
like
it
but
it
is
one
of
my
best
reviewed
products
overall
a
very
tasty
brew
i
am
always
happy
to
have
one
of
these
and
almost
always
keep
some
on
hand
very
good
beer
probably
my
new
official
backup
beer

you
can
find
this
beer
at
so
many
places
drinkability
this
is
a
quality
beer
although
it
is
not

sam
adams
really
hit
the
spot
when
i
was
just
sitting
at
the
bar
waiting
for
friends
i
could
drink
this
as
a
session
beer
or
a
fallback
beer
i
recommend
it
for
anyone
looking
to
get
into
craft
beer
as
well
as
anyone
who
wants
to
enjoy
a
nice
easy
drinking
lager
i
enjoy
this
beer
thoroughly
it
is
a
regular
choice
of
mine
for
meals
of
all
types
a
great
session
beer
that
is
easy
to
find
my
favorite
for
dinner
parties
goes
well
with
just
about
any
meal
easy
tasty
drinking
but
nothing
too
challenging
for
the
senses
light
candied
sweet
fleshy
fruit
apricotish
aroma
with
a
pinch
of
floral
hops
small
cream
colored
head
fades
quickly
to
a
think
film
but
leaves
a
good
deal
of
lace
not
quite
transparent
copper
colored
beer
with
very
little
carbonation
activity
mildly
sweet
caramelbutterscotch
and
toasted
malt
flavor
is
enjoyable
and
balanced
by
some
mildly
bitter
hops
midway
though
the
bitterness
drops
back
towards
the
end
and
the
original
flavors
make
a
faint
reappearance
body
is
moderately
light
and
the
mouthfeel
is
a
bit
fizzy
in
the
middle
but
generally
soft
most
of
the
boston
lagers
ive
had
were
not
too
bad
but
a
few
including
this
bottle
have
been
really
good
its
more
miss
then
hit
but
sometimes
it
just
hits
the
spot
pours
a
bright
bronze
color
with
an
average
sized
head
it
smells
of
very
sweet
carmelized
malts
maybe
also
a
bit
of
hops
as
well
the
taste
is
nice
also
very
rich
and
malty
with
a
wonderful
smooth
clean
finish
great
tasting
beer
the
mouthfeel
is
great
almost
a
perfect
amount
of
carbonation
in
this
one
the
smoothness
and
great
taste
makes
it
a
highly
drinkable
beer
if
this
was
the
only
kind
of
beer
left
in
the
whole
world
id
be
disappointed
but
not
sad
by
any
means
very
good
beer
especially
for
its
common
availability
this
was
my
first
real
beer
and
my
introduction
into
craft
beer
i
still
like
this
beer
and
drink
it
everyonce
in
awhile
this
is
already
a
clasic

a

so
many
units
in

dont
let
its
ubiquity
scare
you
off
this
is
a
nice
session
brew
and
one
of
my
favorite
samuel
adams
beers
its
better
than
i
remember
from
maybe
2
years
ago
after
initial
down
pillow
a
loose
jail
break
of
carbonation
flies
out
to
a
tracetrance
of
frost
hoar
light
orange
to
amber
hue
and
crystalline
to
the
point
of
a
razors
edge
somewhat
wishywash
of
malt
on
nose
with
just
a
scratch
of
hop
and
wafting
honey
slight
buttery
malt
flavor
hits
right
off
the
bat
with
an
afterthought
of
grapefruitlike
hop
this
would
be
a
good
session
libation
a
very
solid
brew
its
not
overwhelmingly
amazing
but
very
very
good
a
pleasantly
malty
brew
that
is
balanced
nicely
by
its
mellow
hop
aroma
and
flavor
a
very
tasty
brew
that
is
not
too
much
on
the
palate
and
this
combination
makes
it
unusually
drinkable
this
would
make
a
great
beer
to
convert
others
to
craft
beer
appreciation
it
is
widely
available
and
is
not
too
rich
which
means
those
accustomed
to
flavorless
macros
wont
be
scared
off
by
the
taste
of
this
one
and
it
is
good
enough
to
maybe
just
maybe
open
their
eyes
to
a
better
world
of
beer
it
may
sound
like
im
getting
a
little
carried
away
but
i
have
used
this
particular
beer
to
get
a
few
of
my
friends
turned
on
to
craft
beer
in
any
event
this
is
a
slightly
fantastic
beer
which
i
have
returned
to
time
and
time
again
in
the
past
and
will
continue
to
do
so
in
the
future
highly
recommended
the
mouthfeel
had
a
lot
more
weight
to
it
than
i
was
expecting
initially
i
thought
it
was
going
to
be
harsh
but
it
turned
out
to
be
smooth
with
just
the
right
amount
of
carbonation
i
didnt
think
it
would
be
very
drinkable
but
four
more
later
that
also
proved
to
be
wrong
overall
this
was
a
beer
im
glad
i
didnt
trust
my
initial
reaction
to
definitely
one
of
the
more
flavorful
lagers
i
have
ever
tasted
although
it
may
not
be
as
easily
drinkable
as
some
beers
it
holds
its
place
as
an
old
standby
the
beer
poured
a
nice
clear
golden
with
a
pretty
white
head
the
aroma
was
basic
some
malt
overcome
by
hops
the
taste
was
also
pretty
standard
but
showed
quality
it
had
a
slight
malt
start
and
quickly
moved
to
a
hops
finish
that
was
not
overpowering
the
feel
was
nice
and
light
and
had
a
bit
of
effervesence
i
bought
this
today
by
default
i
had
gone
to
a
restaurant
and
this
was
the
only
reasonable
choice
i
was
happy
and
now
feel
i
will
have
a
reasonable
choice
in
these
situations
in
the
future
i
was
having
fish
and
chips
and
it
set
well
against
them
the
hops
gave
a
nice
clarifying
bite
12

into
the
imperial
pint
glass
a
copper
color
with
an
offwhite
2
finger
head
that
leaves
lots
of
lacing
and
rings
the
beer
is
low
on
aroma
but
it
smells
of
caramel
malts
and
floral
hops
the
flavors
are
caramel
with
spicyfloral

there
is
a

beer
12
oz
brown
bottle
good
through
july
2005
one
of
my
all
time
favorite
beers
this
beer
has
one
of
the
best
aromas
out
there
the
floral
hops
aroma
is
perfectly
balanced
by
the
malt
pours
a
light
copper
color
with
a
light
white
head
taste
excellent
balance
between
the
bitter
hops
and
sweet
malt
a
good
sturdy
beer
like
our
grandfathers
enjoyed
it
may
not
be
americas
best
lager
but
is
probably
americas
best
lager
that
is
readily
available
cheers
i
was
a
little
surprised
how
much
i
enjoyed
this
beer
it
didnt
make
a
huge
impression
on
me
years
ago
when
i
gave
it
a
try
but
it
did
this
time
sampled
at
a
bar
in
the
pheonix
airport
notes
by
far
the
classic
american
micro
the
quality
of
the
beer
has
remained
unchanged
even
through
phenomenal
growth
and
the
blitz
of
marketing
a
clean
amber
beer
with
orange
highlights
has
a
very
small
off
white
head
no
lace
the
aroma
is
very
lightly
sweet
and
has
a
hint
of
fruityness
in
the
back
very
light
mouthfeel
kind
of
watery
there
is
a
hint
of
malt
sweetness
at
the
start
of
the
flavor
with
a
light
hop
bitterness
just
before
the
dry
finish
uncle
hamish
says
noine
mare
o
these
and
oi
migh
actually
feel
ait
many
of
us
were
introduced
to
better
beer
by
sam
adams
it
is
still
a
good
brew
to
revisit
and
often
the
only
decent
choice
in
my
neighborhood
boston
lager
might
not
the
best
beer
in
america
but
it
is
a
good
reliable
session
beer
pours
a
clear
amber
color
with
a
light
white
head
many
small
bubbles
are
constantly
making
their
way
to
the
surface
lending
to
very
good
head
retention
the
smell
is
sweet
with
a
nice
hops
bouquet
the
taste
is
a
good
balance
between
malt
and
hops
neither
one
dominates
the
other
the
finish
is
slightly
bitter
a
nice
foil
to
the
initial
sweetness
there
is
also
a
hint
of
spice
that
adds
some
mystery
to
the
experience
the
overall
taste
is
very
crisp
and
refreshing
although
the
taste
is
a
little
light
this
really
lends
to
the
drinkability
and
is
a
nice
change
from
the
heavy
beers
i
am
used
to
i
aint
a
lager
drinker
really
this
does
its
job
though
an
ok
brew
from
samuel
adams
overall
a
good
beer
nothing
special
but
it
is
found
everywhere
and
can
stand
out
at
establishments
with
poor
beer
selections
given
its
relatively
cheap
price
and
availability
i
would
also
have
some
in
the
fridge
for
routine
consumption
this
beer
in
my
mind
is
the
beer
that
set
off
the
microbrewing
phenom
it
has
great
taste
probably
the
best
for
a
mass
produced
beer
and
it
is
easily
something
that
you
can
drink
all
night
long
the
flavor
of
a
sam
adams
after
a
long
day
at
work
is
always
relaxing
i
take
my
hat
off
to
the
boston
beer
company
for
starting
a
wonderful
movement
in
beer
god
bless
this
beer
truely
a
classic
and
a
good
friend
pours
a
light
amber
color
great
head
retention
that
sticks
all
over
the
glass
spicy
hops
and
carmel
malt
come
out
in
the
aroma
the
taste
is
balanced
enough
sweet
malts
and
hops
to
go
around
i
always
enjoy
this
beer
you
can
never
go
wrong
with
it
takes
time
to
warm
to
if
youve
been
drinking
pale
adjunct
lagers
but
one
over
that
is
eminently
drinkable
will
make
this
my
regular
if
stocks
last
o
while
not
overly
impressive
sam
adams
boston
lager
is
a
solid
choice
for
your
widely
available
american
beers
i
wont
go
out
of
my
way
to
find
it
but
as
it
is
often
a
staple
in
bars
and
at
parties
due
to
its
affordability
it
may
surprise
you
in
its
quality
overall
a
very
average
beer
not
too
flavorful
but
not
offensive
either
i
think
these
qualities
are
what
make
it
a
staple
social
beer
always
a
good
decision
yes
it
is
i
dont
know
why
i
didnt
write
a
review
for
this
earlier
but
now
i
am
sams
is
by
far
the
best
american
beer
it
has
the
perfect
color
for
a
lager
dark
but
not
to
dark
the
taste
is
what
a
beer
should
taste
like
it
is
also
a
good
beer
to
ahve
with
lets
say
a
hamburg
steak
andor
a
salad
you
can
also
cook
with
it
pour
it
over
your
burgers
on
the
grill
and
it
will
add
real
flavor
it
never
ever
skunks
up
on
you
so
you
can
hold
on
it
in
the
fridge
for
a
while
too
orange
copper
pour
with
a
nice
white
moonlike
crater
head
that
laces
down
the
sides
of
the
glass
slightly
floral
and
hoppy
with
notes
of
caramel
and
citrus
orange
peel
the
mouthfeel
is
consistant
with
the
style
tastes
great
just
like
the
last
one
i
had
i
can
always
count
on
a
sam
adams
lager
this
beer
pours
a
honey
golden
color
and
produces
little
head
which
leaves
a
ring
about
the
glass
there
are
streams
of
bubbles
rising
from
the
bottom
slightly
sour
malty
smell
is
given
off
by
the
beer
taste
has
a
solid
malt
background
and
a
sort
of
straw
character
to
it
the
boston
lager
is
good
sitting
in
the
mouth
and
isnt
as
light
as
most
lagers
i
could
definitely
drink
a
couple
of
these
and
i
have
too
12

nice

between

but
not
a

the

medium

good
drinkability
so
its
not
problem
to
drink
several
of
these
a
good
simple

is
the

83
for
a
12oz
bottle
from
market
basket
concord
nh
initially
you
should
be
able
to
taste
the
body
and
sweetness
of
the
malt
this
beer
has
real
substance
its
not
thin
or
watery
the
sweet
is
followed
up
by
some
tartness
but
has
a
very
balanced
flavor
the
complexity
is
there
but
not
too
much
a
persone
can
taste
the
toffee
honey
flavor
while
moving
into
the
citrus
flavoring
of
the
hops
served
on
tap
at
applebees
in
chino
ca
ive
had
this
beer
several
times
in
the
bottle
but
never
on
tap
so
i
figured
its
about
time
i
review
it
it
was
served
in
a
tall
pilsner
glass
with
a
nice
off
white
and
creamy
head
on
top
of
the
golen
hued
beer
the
aroma
on
this
beer
is
nice
and
hoppy
without
being
intimidating
the
flavor
is
very
good
with
an
excellent
balance
of
light
malt
flavor
with
floral
hoppy
flavor
the
malt
profile
is
not
bready
in
nature
but
more
crisp
and
sweet
this
is
one
of
the
better
balanced
beers
out
there
very
tasty
with
a
soft
light
to
medium
body
this
is
definately
a
great
standby
beer
for
places
like
applebees
where
they
generally
serve
macro
swill
and
dont
tend
to
serve
good
beer
nice
clarity
a
pale
amber
color
with
decent
head
the
aroma
is
nice
a
hint
of
noble
minty
woody
hops
along
with
a
faint
clear
helping
of
malt
and
not
much
else
the
flavor
is
good
as
well
not
overpowering
or
aweinspiring
but
solid
from
start
to
finish
with
a
clean
maltiness
a
solid
backbone
of
bitterness
at
the
end
some
more
of
that
noble
hop
flavor
again
kind
of
woodlike
to
me
hints
of
cedar
and
spicy
minty
and
a
little
bit
of
caramel
good
mouthfeel
samuel
adams
is
kind
of
maligned
in
that
they
arent
really
a
micro
but
they
make
a
solid
product
that
is
way
better
than
budmillercoors
and
the
imports
like
heinekin
it
was
definitely
the
best
choice
i
had
at
the
convenience
store
this
past
holiday
weekend
christmas
2004
although
the
yuengling
lager
was
my
2nd
choice
as
i
have
never
had
it
before
the
green
bottles
just
keep
me
away
pours
a
medium
amber
with
a
good
2
finger
head
and
good
lace
mildly
smells
of
sweet
malt
with
a
faint
hop
aroma
taste
of
immediate
sweet
malt
that
is
quickly
followed
my
the
hop
spicyness
not
to
overpowering
very
well
balanced
crisp
i
wouldnt
call
this
a
lawnmower
beer
but
it
is
fairly
flavprful
for
a
average
american
lager
and
very
drinkable
this
is
my
standard
when
eating
out
because
it
usually
goes
well
with
all
types
of
food
12oz
single
from
my
holiday
sampler
pours
out
with
a
body
a
perfect
shade
of
amber
similar
to
the
sam
light
i
had
a
few
moments
ago
the
head
is
white
voluminous
and
robust
im
actually
getting
sheets
of
lace
down
the
side
of
the
glass
and
the
head
retention
is
pretty
great
as
well
the
nose
is
sweet
toffee
and
biscuity
malts
with
a
faint
sprinkling
of
earthy
bitterness
about
the
edges
as
i
swallow
the
first
thing
i
notice
is
this
is
quiet
a
bit
sweeter
than
i
remember
it
being
nice
round
toffee
flavors
up
front
accompanied
by
a
mild
fruitiness
the
middle
is
grainy
in
a
good
way
and
is
eventually
accompanied
by
a
wellbalanced
earthen
bitterness
in
the
finish
the
mouthfeel
is
light
but
has
quiet
a
bit
more
body
than
your
typical
pale
lager
a
great
well
rounded
beer
flavorful
and
with
nice
session
appeal
i
think
i
will
find
myself
going
to
this
one
more
often
final
thoughts
i
seem
to
remember
this
beer
as
being
more
robust
in
flavor
and
felt
that
this
has
been
toned
down
its
probably
been
almost
a
year
since
i
have
had
any
sam
adams
products
a
very
good
beer
nonetheless
i
forgot
how
mush
i
missed
this
thanks
to
scott
my
college
roomate
who
introduced
me
to
this
in
the
fall
of
95
and
turned
me
on
to
better
beer
pours
a
very
clear
deep
pale
pumpkin
orange
color
very
carbonated
for
the
style
head
is
thick
white
and
surprisingly
long
lasting
clings
to
the
side
of
the
mug
nicely
taste
is
good
i
can
honestly
say
that
this
macro
lager
tastes
better
than
some
repeat
some
of
the
craft
lagers
ive
had
it
shouldnt
win
any
best
of
show
awards
either
but
the
fact
that
it
is
a
decent
beer
in
a
market
of
fizzy
yellow
beers
is
something
of
merit
quite
sweet
hops
are
subtle
there
are
certainly
no
bold
czech
hops
here
strawlike
and
sweet
then
dry
on
the
aftertaste
if
forced
to
drink
a
macro
as
unfortunately
some
social
situations
demand
i
will
most
likely
ask
for
this
12
ouncer
with
freshness
indication
on
the
label
pours
very
clear
darker
straw
shade
clear
supports
a
snow
white
tiny
bubble
head
which
exhibits
respectable
retention
and
leaves
b
lacing
fine
segemented
and
dispersed
bready
floral
nose
this
is
crisp
and
snappy
lager
widely
available
and
a
useful
fallback
brew
at
many
budmillercooors
light
type
establishments
finishes
clean
and
drying
with
a
hint
of
spice
nice
notes
as
many
beer
fans
say
this
isnt
an
interesting
enough
beer
to
drink
if
theres
a
choice
of
micros
but
its
not
bad
and
at
many
bars
where
its
the
only
choice

the

is
a

of

its
a

odd
the

tastes
maltier

i
remember
or
that
it

should
the

definately
come
in
at

quell

the

heavy

opinion
the

would
make
for
a

beer
albeit
not
a
great
one
a
good
solid
beer
with
no

weeknesses

nothing
outstanding
i
always
look
at
it
as
a

beer

the
choices
are

other

would

ot

really

refreshing
on
a

day
i
sat
outside
and
alternated
between
this
and
live
oak
hefe
both
tasty
brews
definitely
above
average
for
the
style
i
normally
dont
enjoy
amber
lagers
this
much
i
would
definitely
have
this
again
after
drinking
the
belgian
ale
this
is
one
is
a
refreshing
light
beer
the
beertender
reminds
me
this
is
not
a
light
beer
the
color
is
amber
there
was
a
good
head
on
it
after
the
pour
that
is
gone
now
it
has
a
decent
finish
easy
to
drink
with
an
alelike
bitter
taste
i
like
i
could
drink
quite
a
few
of
these
me
thinks
o
overall
rather
unremarkable
i
dont
think
id
drink
this
one
again
not
that
it
was
bad
but
it
certainly
nothing
special
glad
i
was
able
to
try
a
beer
that
is
usually
not
available
to
me
though
pours
a
very
pretty
amber
with
no
head
flavour
profile
is
well
balanced
freshtasting
and
all
around
decent
but
nothing
particularly
interesting
tastes
like
lots
of
other
local
ambers
the
fresh
hops
are
not
really
something
im
particular
fond
of
but
it
adds
a
nice
fresh
fruity
bitterness
a
lot
of
people
might
like
its
just
not
something
im
personally
a
fan
of
o
very
enjoyable
and
a
decent
example
for
the
style
the
lingering
bitterness
it
lingers
for
quite
a
while
makes
the
beer
not
very
sessionable
but
i
would
enjoy
this
beer
at
another
opportunity
just
not
many
of
them
in
a
sitting
this
pours
a
clear
caramel
color
with
a
tight
layer
of
foam
topping
it
theres
a
muted
aroma
and
this
light
malty
flavor
with
a
sharp
hoppy
bitterness
that
rounds
it
out
and
honestly
thats
the
way
i
like
my
amber
lagers
with
character
and
a
kick
not
just
malty
syrup
good
one
overallif
these
beers
were
cannedbottled
this
would
be
my
go
to

beers
another
really
nice
offering
from
live
oak
o
really
exceptional
beer
tasty
and
drinkable
good
representation
of
the
style
happy
they
gave
this
year
around
overall
honestly
im
not
that
big
a
fan
of
brown
ales
or
amber
ales
and
this
one
was
no
exception
it
didnt
do
much
to
separate
itself
from
the
pack
i
always
enjoy
live
oaks
beers
so
i
was
slightly
disappointed
by
this
offering
amber
in
color
smells
of
toffee
and
a
hint
of
cinnamon
taste
is
light
grainup
front
followed
by
caramel
and
finishes
with
oaky
smoke
mouthfeel
is
smooth
low
carbonation
a
pretty
good
beer
somewhat
bland
though
i
like
their
hefei
much
more
than
i
like
this
beer
personally
d
amazing
drinkability
could
drink
this
for
several
hours
really
enjoyed
this
one
will
not
be
seeking
it
out
soon
but
if
its
on
the
menu
i
may
grab
it
again
the
beer
pours
an
amber
color
with
a
white
head
the
aroma
is
very
nice
i
get
quite
a
bit
of
toffee
but
i
also
get
some
bread
and
a
little
bit
of
grape
the
flavor
is
more
of
the
same
with
a
lot
of
toffee
and
bready
malt
as
well
as
a
little
bit
of
pine
and
grass
from
the
hops
i
also
get
a
little
bit
of
grape
in
the
flavor
as
well
medium
mouthfeel
and
medium
carbonation
with
that
said
dont
go
to
cane
and
abels
in
austin
it
a
waste
of
time
had
it
again
in
much
better
quality
but
still
nothing
equal
to
their
other
beers
d
overall
this
is
a
good
sessionable
beer
it
has
a
good
taste
thats
easy
to
drink
not
the
first
live
oak
beer
id
pick
but
a
good
one
thats
worth
a
try
sometime
pours
with
a
dark
amber
color
minimal
head
with
a
transparent
body
smells
were
abundant
with
malts
low
in
hops
compared
to
other

lagers
ive
tasted
the
malts
werent
overpowering
the
taste
was
bitter
with
malts
but
it
wasnt
an
uncomfortable
bitterness
was
a
smooth
drink
overall
this
is
not
a
style
im
very
particular
of
but
this
was
definitely
one
of
the
better
ones
ive
had
a
thin
offwhite
head
that
had
begun
to
dissipate
even
as
it
was
being
served
to
me
color
was
a
mediumamber
with
nequality
clarity
nose
was
fairly
sweet
for
a
lagerstyle
beer
mouthfeel
was
medium
with
a
good
bit
of
sweetness
on
the
tongue
finish
remained
sweet
decent
but
not
compelling
there
is
just
not
a
lot
here
i
cant
see
reaching
for
this
over
the
hefe
though
worth
at
least
one
try
d
i
liked
it
didnt
love
it
im
glad
i
got
to
try
a
local
austin
brewery
beer
ill
look
forward
to
trying
more
when
im
in
the
area
d
no
problem
with
hammering
this
one
over
and
over
if
you
so
desire

not

smell
starts
with

nuttiness
turning

a

vegetal

finish
gives
the
slightest
bit
of
hops
on
the
back
of
your
tongue
med
alcohol
smells
of
citrusy
grapefruit
american
hops
and
maybe
a
little
caramel
from
the
malt
taste
is
dominated
by
big
hop
flavor
with
a
little
caramel
adding
some
balance
the
mouthfeel
is
thin
making
it
good
for
washing
down
a
meal
an
alright
beer
but
a
little
one
dimensional
drinkability
excellent
drinkability
i
could
drink
this
all
night
and
be
happy
none
of
the
flavors
are
too
overwhelming
i
found
it
nicely
balanced
and
i
kept
wanting
more
i
always
find
myself
ordering
this
when
im
in
austin
a
nice
amber
lager
with
a
tasty
hop
assertiveness
that
while
welcome
might
give
this
beer
a
just
slightly
unbalanced
quality
this
was
a
good
beer
very
drinkable
definitely
worth
trying
if
you
find
yourself
in
texas
i
was
told
live
oak
is
a
good
brewery
out
there
this
was
my
first
of
their
line
id
have
it
again
but
wasnt
my
favorite
not
bad
at
all
though
the
aroma
is
full
of
smooth
caramel
malts
the
flavor
matches
with
the
same
caramel
and
bread
but
with
a
dry
almost
burnt
toffee
note
the
beer
finishes
with
grassy
bitterness
its
not
big
but
its
the
most
prominent
taste
d
this
is
a
really
nice
amber
from
a
great
brewery
but
i
was
hoping
they
would
do
even
better
with
this
style
the
mouth
is
smooth
could
be
a
session
beer
but
i
would
want
something
a
bit
more
bold
draft
at
billys
in
austin
light
amber
in
color
with
light
to
medium
carbonation
and
small
to
medium
white
head
smell
is
of
caramel
sweetness
intense
juicy
dried
apricots
slight
maltiness
taste
is
similar
with
a
mild
bitterness
as
well
medium
finish
and
a
good
beer
overall
a
nice
viennastyle
lager
it
came
in
a
big
20
oz
glass
without
a
lot
of
head
on
it
it
was
a
sparkling
amber
color
aroma
was
a
good
amount
of
malt
without
any
cerealness
and
with
a
bit
of
hop
flavor
was
more
of
the
same
a
nice
amount
of
malt
without
any
loss
of
refreshingness
very
good
this
beer
is
pretty
decent
and
clings
to
the
palate
well
makes
for
a
decent
session
the
mouthfeel
is
very
light
very
sessionable
and
pretty
tasty
if
you
like
a
beer
with
a
fairly
low
hop
profile
and
a
nice
flavor
this
should
do
the
trick
for
you
d
good
drinkability
high
sessionability
went
great
with
some
pizza
pours
a
deep
amber
color
with
a
creamy
light
tan
head
that
settles
into
a
nice
lace
nose
is
grassy
and
citrusy
hops
taste
begins
with
fruity
caramel
malt
and
a
toasted
nuttiness
followed
by
a
somewhat
spicy
hop
bitterness
with
a
bit
of
grapefruit
rind
finish
is
crisp
would
make
a
good
session
beer
opinion
this
was
an
ok
beer
but
there
were
a
couple
off
flavors
to
add
to
the
lack
of
carbonation
that
was
disappointing
perhaps
i
had
a
dirty
glass
as
i
saw
latter
pours
that
had
more
head
retention
i
would
like
to
try
this
beer
again
at
the
brewery
to
make
sure
that
i
was
getting
what
they
intended
to
be
poured
draft
at
flying
saucer
in
san
antonio
live
oaks
big
bark
amber
lager
is
a
bolder
amber
lager
with
some
combat
going
on
between
the
malt
and
hops
as
noted
by
other
reviewers
this
beer
wont
please
everyone
but
still
holds
up
with
live
oaks
quality
standards
the
color
is
a
shiny
amber
with
an
averagesized
light
brown
head
the
aroma
is
of
lightly
toasted
malt
pretty
good
but
not
quite
rich
enough
taste
is
more
of
the
same
the
strength
of
the
malts
seems
to
be
just
a
little
weak
for
the
style
a
little
graininess
does
give
the
flavor
another
facet
looking
at
the
other
reviews
it
seems
to
have
been
hoppier
in
the
past
or
i
got
a
weird
batch
anyway
this
beer
seems
taylored
for
session
drinking
but
cannot
compete
in
taste
with
some
of
the
maltier
ambers
this
beer
could
have
been
so
much
better
if
the
hops
were
more
discernable
otherwise
this
is
a
sweet
lager
that
seems
more
like
an
oktoberfest
to
me
overall
impression
a
very
thirst
quenching
beer
i
enjoyed
it
it
reminded
me
of
abita
amber
or
st
arnolds
amber
so
i
think
it
is
fairly
close
to
style
i
would
make
a
decent
session
but
i
was
happy
after
one
beer
next
time
ill
try
another
live
oak
this
is
a
delicious
balanced
maltyhoppynutty
amber
lager
fantastic
drinkabilitynotes
a
bit
offtrail
with
respect
to
the
hoppiness
to
judge
by
the
amber
ales
that
i
have
sampled
but
nonetheless
tasty
and
quite
drinkable
reviewed
on
tap
at
waterloo
icehouse
in
austin
texas
wow
thats
bad
very
cloying
malty
mess
reminds
me
of
a
beer
thats
been
in
the
sun
for
far
too
long
12
oz
bottle
from
bevmo
malt
forward
beers
like
this
typically
dont
get
as
much
respect
but
i
found
this
to
be
a
tasty
rich
tasting
amber
with
faint
yet
distinct
woody
and
earthy
flavors
and
little
hop
bitterness
a
very
smooth
exemplary
lager
and
very
drinkable
im
ready
for
another
overall
nice
and
easydrinking
with
enough
complexity
to
not
get
boring
one
of
those
beers
that
can
be
enjoyed
by
beer
noobs
and
vets
made
me
want
to
have
another
drinkability
definitely
a
recommendation
and
on
my
goto
list
for
easy
drinking
beers
very
tasty
but
a
bit
too
oily
and
not
so
easy
to
drink
overall
this
beer
is
a
cross
between
a
real
amber
ale
think
ballast
point
calico
copper
amber
ale
and
a
miller
genuine
draft
the
beer
is
not
offensive
its
just
lacking
in
character
karl
strauss
own
red
trolly
ale
is
a
better
interpretation
of
the
style
a
decent
easy
drinking
amber
a
good
not
great
amber
lager
very
easy
to
drink
almost
tastes
like
a
light
beer
the
flavor
is
pretty
simple
and
while
theres
not
too
much
to
write
about
here
this
goes
pretty
well
with
food
especially
greasy
bar
food
which
i
gladly
paired
this
with
tonight
on
its
own
it
doesnt
ask
for
much
which
is
why
whoever
drinks
it
wouldnt
have
to
as
well
after
being
a
fan
of
karl
strausss
tower
10
ipa
and
being
spoiled
with
anchor
steam
beer
this
slightly
underwhelms
overall
especially
if
this
is
their
flagship
beer
easy
to
drink
but
it
definitely
is
simple
at
1
30
a
bottle
cant
really
complain
though
overall
a
fairly
good
though
simple
lager
from
karl
strauss
drinks
close
to
an
oktoberfest
marzen
brew
drinkable
and
somewhat
enjoyable
but
i
wouldnt
go
out
of
my
way
to
find
it
would
make
for
a
decent
session
brew
i
was
hoping
for
a
bit
more
but
an
ok
amber
overall
pretty
decent
i
think
that
its
on
par
with
a
boston
lager
flavor
is
a
bit
on
the
lighter
side
and
the
honey
sweetness
is
probably
what
drops
down
the
score
for
alot
of
ppl
but
the
hop
profile
is
refreshing
and
different
in
a
lager
for
what
it
is
its
very
nice
overall
this
is
a
decent
amber
it
is
very
malty
it
has
a
bunch
of
flavors
that
seem
to
only
mix
ok
but
not
perfect
more
nuttiness
oktoberfest
like
sweetness
a
beer
that
drinks
heavier
than
you
would
think
from
looking
at
the
abv
its
not
exactly
complex
but
it
is
a
substantial
step
up
above
fizzy
yellow
stuff
this
is
a
good
gateway
beer
reminiscient
of
sprechers
vienna
lager
if
youre
into
that
use
this
beer
to
warm
people
up
to
the
idea
of
getting
into
drinking
the
heavier
and
crazier
stuff
with
you
someday
its
decent
and
flavorful
without
being
out
there
or
too
adventurous
overall
a
very
simple
amber
lager
with
simplicity
being
its
only
flaw
all
things
considered
this
is
pretty
enjoyable
a
man
could
drink
a
lot
of
this
dr
drinkable
but
very
mundane
i
wouldnt
have
it
again
it
needs
more
complexity
more
smoothness
and
some
serious
flavour
profile
to
be
worthy
of
consumption
solid
vienna
lager
an
extremely
bready
amber
ale
and
flavorful
enough
per
the
style
quite
unassuming
but
a
good
example
of
how
much
flavor
can
be
packed
into
a
lowalcohol
lowhop
beer
it
manages
to
be
quite
drinkable
with
a
warm
flavor
and
just
a
touch
of
tartness
pours
a
clear
orange
color
with
a
1
inch
offwhite
head
that
fades
to
a
thin
film
random
splotches
of
lace
form
here
and
there
on
the
glass
on
the
drink
down
smells
of
toasted
malt
and
slight
haygrass
taste
is
pretty
watered
down
malt
with
some
grasshop
flavors
coming
in
on
the
end
this
beer
has
a
good
level
of
carbonation
with
a
crisp
and
clean
mouthfeel
overall
this
is
a
a
pretty
average
beer
all
around
nothing
too
great
but
nothing
too
offensive
a
good
choice
if
there
is
nothing
else
worthwhile
o
id
order
it
maybe
if
i
needed
a
beer
but
i
dont
really
need
a
beer
most
times
taste
is
light
caramelizedtoast
sweetness
up
front
then
dryer
with
same
light
flavour
and
light
zesty
vague
bittrness
faintly
citrusy
grassy
it
is
pretty
good
pleasant
but
simple
a
bit
thin
and
slightly
watery
d
this
is
basically
in
the
dos
equis
amber
realm
of
vienna
lager
not
bad
tasting
just
not
interesting
at
all
boston
lager
and
negra
modelo
completely
outshine
this
effort
in
the
same
category
poured
ontap
in
downtown
san
diego
at
the
columbia
street
brewpub
there
isnt
a
whole
lot
of
good
to
say
about
this
so
i
will
keep
this
short
and
sweet
the
beer
was
poured
into
a
pint
glass
it
was
extremely
light
colored
especially
for
the
style
the
beer
had
no
real
outstanding
flavors
basic
malt
backbone
with
little
to
offer
past
that
it
has
a
very
disappointing
aftertate
although
typical
of
a
lager
musty
and
a
bit
sour
sour
aftertaste
as
well
there
is
a
very
light
caramel
flavor
as
well
as
a
light
bitterness
flavor
is
clean
overall
but
the
high
carbonation
masks
the
body
and
flavor
nothing
impresses
me
here
but
its
tolerable
thanks
mrmiles
for
the
opportunity
drinkability
solid
session
beer
would
seek
out
again
cheers
a
rather
average
beer
but
for
the
style
its
certainly
not
terrible
its
funny
that
the
reviews
are
sort
of
all
over
the
place
kinda
sounds
like
the
lax
bar
needs
to
clean
their
tap
lines
this
is
a
clean
somewhat
sweet
lager
its
a
nice
clear
amber
with
a
dissipating
white
head
that
manages
to
hang
on
with
a
very
tight
white
cap
after
a
minute
the
aroma
is
mostly
doughy
malt
sweetness
theres
a
faint
hint
of
herbal
hops
but
its
just
a
low
abv
amber
lager
with
its
roots
in
german
brewing
it
lacks
any
real
depth
of
malt
flavor
the
flavor
is
vaguely
sweet
and
fairly
clean
its
nice
to
have
a
4
5
abv
beer
but
this
one
wants
for
flavor
mouthfeel
is
inoffensive
though
the
carbonation
seems
oddly
low
ok
beer
drinkability
very
tasty
and
smooth
drinking
it
is
the
most
flavorful
lager
ive
ever
had
i
did
like
the
carbonation
and
it
was
easy
to
drink
d
it
has
a
special
place
in
my
heart
so
i
can
always
drink
these
at
a
party
though
there
are
a
lot
of
other
beers
i
prefer
nothing
really
stands
out
but
not
really
bad
a
bit
to
sweet
this
was
a
great
beer
i
had
it
at
their
location
in
carlsbad
i
would
have
it
again
first
one
from
karl
strauss
and
i
am
not
impressed
not
having
had
this
beer
in
some
time
i
was
curious
about
the
new
bottling
line
this
beer
tastes
fresher
cleaner
and
a
bit
lightermore
balanced
in
malts
than
i
recall
ill
have
to
reserve
one
to
try
side
by
side
with
a
out
of
state
bottle
to
better
ascertain
drinkability
i
liked
the
beer
it
was
an
average
beer
but
easily
one
i
could
drink
a
lot
of
i
would
recommend
this
to
friends
and
id
drink
this
again
a
tasty
lager
that
wont
wow
you
with
flavor
but
will
be
a
hit
with
most
palates
can
i
order
a
pitcher
its
a
decent
beer
not
too
bad
and
not
too
great
this
would
be
a
good
beer
for
non
bas
not
an
excellent
beer
in
this
category
though
i
may
be
overgenerous
as
it
is
a
hometown
brew
good
color
pours
bright
amber
with
a
short
offwhtie
head
sweet
caramel
and
bread
nose
very
easy
to
drink
with
a
smooth
mouthfeel
sweet
caramel
maltbase
but
light
citrus
hops
are
detectable
wont
blow
anyone
away
but
a
very
good
beer
nonetheless
i
recently
had
this
on
tap
at
lax
and
ive
also
had
it
at
the
brewpub
in
downtown
san
diego
i
think
its
a
mighty
fine
amber
pours
a
cloudy
tan
color
with
a
thin
head
and
not
a
lot
of
lacing
of
the
glass
not
much
of
an
aroma
but
i
like
the
rich
caramel
malt
flavor
that
has
an
almost
buttery
character
as
the
brew
warms
went
well
with
the
turkey
sandwich
i
ate
it
with
last
time
i
had
this
medium
carbonation
a
decent
session
beer
but
not
true
to
style
poured
into
a
weizen
glass
clear
amber
color
with
a
thin
white
head
that
quickly
fades
to
a
ring
spots
of
retention
but
they
dont
last
long
smells
too
sweet
with
caramel
malt
dominating
tastes
better
with
a
touch
of
hop
spice
and
dark
bready
flavors
the
finish
is
dominated
by
the
diacetyl
which
i
think
is
okay
for
the
style
but
its
not
syrupy
like
most
beers
with
high
diacetyl
the
lagering
leaves
it
fairly
light
bodied
for
its
malty
flavor
i
think
this
is
one
of
the
most
sessionable
malty
beers
ive
had
of
late
and
if
i
lived
out
here
i
could
see
buying
a
sixer
of
this
for
some
sweet
summertime
suds
none
for
me
thank
you
my
beer
gut
cant
afford
to
drink
something
that
feels
this
heavy
and
tastes
this
light
drinkable
it
didnt
really
stand
out
poured
a
medium
gold
color
small
white
foamy
head
looked
more
like
an
ipa
or
pale
aroma
is
malty
and
slightly
sweet
mild
malts
and
hops
mild
flavor
good
balance
of
hops
and
malts
slight
taste
of
roasted
malts
very
subtle
finish
is
smooth
aftertaste
is
slightly
malty
no
bitterness
the
neck
label
displays
it
is
karls
favorite
beer
in
small
print
good
choice
karl
or
is
it
i
have
two
other
of
his
beers
in
my
fridge
which
i
will
sample
sometime
so
i
hope
this
while
quite
good
indeed
isnt
the
brands
high
tide
the
mouth
is
slick
and
perhaps
a
bit
over
carbonated
while
this
is
an
easy
enough
drinker
i
think
it
serves
best
as
a
crossover
beer
drinkability
is
much
improved
with
the
malt
tamed
i
have
to
suspect
they
altered
the
recipe
a
beer
that
seems
to
be
better
in
the
bottle
than
the
tap
d
comparing
this
to
other
amber
lagers
i
have
had
i
would
say
this
is
good
and
highly
drinkable
in
my
opinion
even
for
the
style
it
needs
a
little
more
hop
presence
to
be
considered
a
good
brew
that
said
this
is
a
very
good
session
brew
and
more
interesting
than
their
woody
gold
drinkability
not
aweful
but
not
particularly
wonderful
either
mouthfeel
drinkability
well
carbonated
maybe
a
tad
rough
at
the
start
but
mellowed
nicely
there
after
maybe
due
to
increasing
temp
not
a
bad
amber
overall
an
average
beer
nothing
special
here
and
it
can
be
a
bit
too
sweet
theres
enough
good
beers
out
there
so
that
i
wont
have
to
try
this
again
i
had
one
of
these
expecting
another
lagery
sam
adams
microbrew
taste
but
i
was
absolutely
blown
away
the
appearance
is
nice
an
amber
very
well
done
on
the
color
a
bit
anchor
steam
looking
the
smell
is
great
a
lil
bit
of
roasting
and
sweetness
which
reflects
the
taste
very
sweet
like
a
refined
sam
adams
with
stella
artois
characteristics
perfect
the
taste
is
awesome
for
a
lager
i
could
drink
these
all
day
very
very
well
done
a
little
bit
of
roasted
character
with
sweetness
and
subtle
malt
presence
very
little
hops
which
is
great
because
something
this
sessionable
doesnt
need
to
be
bitter
the
mouthfeel
is
above
average
and
in
fact
fairly
heavy
but
the
drinkability
blows
this
out
of
the
water
absolutely
perfect
everyone
should
try
this
when
their
in
the
san
diego
area
very
well
done
strauss
has
a
new
follower
if
you
like
sam
adams
and
like
a
little
bit
of
sweetness
this
is
for
you
not
the
greatest
beer
in
the
world
but
on
a
warm
summer
day
this
makes
a
wonderful
lawnmower
brew
if
you
crossed
a
yeungling
with
a
fat
tire
thats
what
this
beer
is
pretty
easy
to
drink
if
you
dont
mind
the
sweetness
too
many
other
beers
id
much
rather
drink
the
amber
lager
fresh
at
the
brewery
is
another
story
during
a
recent
visit
to
san
diego
i
had
this
brew
on
tap
in
a
gaslamp
area
restaurant
i
found
it
to
be
an
enjoyable
flavorful
if
ordinary
brew
its
a
deep
golden
color
with
only
a
shadow
of
amber
and
a
modest
white
head
the
aroma
is
a
well
proportioned
mix
of
malt
and
hop
of
medium
intensity
theres
a
little
grain
and
notable
caramel
the
taste
is
mildly
sweet
with
a
slant
toward
maltiness
its
certainly
not
outstanding
but
it
went
well
with
dinner
and
left
me
satisfied
cheers
after
drinking
this
beer
i
now
know
why
all
the
other
reviews
for
amber
lager
were
so
short
theres
just
nothing
remarkable
one
way
or
another
about
this
beer
itd
be
a
good
beer
to
have
around
for
nonba
friends
and
as
an
allmalt
lager
its
certainly
several
steps
above
the
macro
lagers
but
other
than
that
theres
no
real
reason
to
ever
try
one
a
very
hohum
brew
imho
nice
copper
look
but
a
weak
head
which
dissipated
quickly
smell
was
quite
faintalthough
i
did
drink
it
in
a
restaurant
which
impedes
the
nose
the
taste
profile
was
true
to
type
but
had
a
definite
watered
down
taste
and
most
noticably
mouthfeel
cannot
stand
head
to
head
with
sa
which
unfortunately
for
strauss
is
its
direct
competitor
easy
guzzler
on
a
hot
day
though
overall
an
uneventful
easily
forgettable
beer
went
well
with
the
pizza
though
west
coast
yuengling
the
beer
as
it
sat
in
my
6
00
plastic
cup
at
the
airport
was
a
translucent
deep
amber
color
with
a
rather
thin
off
white
head
that
was
bubbly
in
texture
and
the
lace
a
micro
thin
sheet
to
not
quite
seal
the
glass
nose
was
mostly
malt
with
a
hint
of
citrus
start
sweet
and
nicely
malted
with
the
top
light
to
middling
in
feel
finish
was
stingingly
acidic
the
hops
apropos
to
the
style
and
the
aftertaste
dry
and
long
lasting
a
drinkable
beer
but
certainly
nothing
to
get
excited
about
medium
gold
color
small
white
foamy
head
aroma
is
malty
and
slightly
sweet
mild
malts
and
hops
mild
flavor
good
balance
of
hops
and
malts
slight
taste
of
roasted
malts
very
subtle
finish
is
smooth
aftertaste
is
slightly
malty
no
bitterness
a
solid
lager
that
has
a
good
look
and
good
taste
the
amber
color
is
joined
by
a
decent
offwhite
head
that
comes
up
full
and
lingers
a
short
while
the
lacing
is
ok
if
not
impressive
malty
caramel
nose
also
gives
slight
hints
of
hops
for
the
balance
that
results
full
bodied
and
tasty
palate
mild
aftertaste
that
leaves
a
bit
of
a
bready
sense
smooth
and
even
feel
very
drinkable
lager
this
is
a
decent
beer
but
not
what
i
expected
it
poured
a
nice
amber
color
with
a
small
head
that
fizzled
away
quickly
the
smell
kind
of
reminded
me
of
coors
which
did
not
get
me
too
excited
about
taking
a
drink
but
lo
and
behold
the
taste
was
not
that
bad
at
all
this
beer
had
kind
of
a
strange
carlmely
flavor
to
it
that
was
pretty
drinkable
along
with
a
kind
of
floral
taste
that
went
down
very
easy
although
this
is
not
a
beer
that
i
would
buy
instead
of
say
stone
pale
ale
or
sierra
nevada
pale
ale
as
a
session
beer
these
would
go
down
pretty
well
if
it
came
down
to
it
a
very
respectable
brew
karl
strauss
amber
lager
deep
brown
beer
no
head
no
lace
but
that
was
solely
due
to
the
publicans
giving
me
every
drop
for
s
strong
malt
aroma
reminds
me
of
milwaukee
as
a
kid
initial
taste
was
very
sweet
almost
unpleasant
improved
significantly
as
it
warmed
with
a
very
pronounced
breadcracker
malt
sweetness
barely
balanced
by
mild
hops
not
bad
overall
omg
i
could
easily
make
this
my
goto
session
lager
if
only
it
were
readily
available
on
the
east
coast
overall
gross
i
wont
be
trying
this
again
im
sure
this
beer
is
great
for
its
style
300

reviewers
cant
be
wrong
however
it
is
definitely
not
one
ill
be
coming
back
for

advocates
did

not

how
this

the
taste

malty

way
with
a
light
bite
at

balance
it
all
off
it
is
fairly
easy

ill

i
thought
this

it

it
wasnt

i
have
seen
this
beer
before
pale
straw
with
a
white
head
that
drops
and
does
not
lace
smells
of
corn
a
sweetness
in
the
body
that
is
clearly
not
from
malt
some
vegetal
and
creamed
corn
flavours
play
on
the
palate
surprisingly
clean
finish
on
the
palate
with
no
substantial
off
flavours
nor
hop
bitterness
for
what
it
is
not
bad
what
i
want
not
so
much
extremely
drinkable
but
not
a
whole
lot
of
flavour
drinkability
wise
you
could
suck
these
down
all
night
i
know
they
used
to
make
splits
my
father
used
to
pound
down
when
he
was
my
age
i
believe
this
paticular
bottle
is
a
canadian
reuseable
bottle
i
would
never
buy
this
i
was
given
a
12pack
as
a
tip
but
its
worth
atleast
one
try
painfully
mediocre
beer
with
no
redeeming
factor
other
then
being
easy
to
drink
got
a
bottle
of
this
at
a
bar
because
i
would
never
buy
a
six
pack
and
wanted
to
get
it
over
with
sweet
toasted
grain
and
corn
flavors
mouthfeel
is
kinda
thin
and
watery
but
drinkable
medium
carbonation
too
best
served
cold
nothing
special
here
just
as
dull
and
somewhat
offputting
as
the
rest
of
the
molsoncarling
premium
lager
products
my
dad
was
bangon
in
his
one
gulp
assessment
it
tastes
like
yer
average
beer
from
back
then
the
times
they
havent
changed
o
v
corn
malt
but
the
grain
sweetness
has
a
similarity
that
just
made
me
think
of
it
this
is
like
an
ofest
extra
light
i
m
happy
to
have
received
a
halfcase
of
these
and
hope
my
return
toss
of
a

4pack
will
be

tale
end
where
they
linger
on
the
tongue
the
taste
is
good
with
clean
overall
flavor
with
bready
and
mild
malt
with
toastiness
in
the
taste
and
a
mild
yeast
taste
which
has
a
gentle
fruitiness
and
slight
hop
spice
adds
to
the
taste
overall
this
is
a
good
lager
but
not
overly
complex
pretty
average
for
the
style
w
good
drinkabliity
o
this
should
be
reclassified
as
an
amber
or
perhaps
even
a
vienna
lager
at
the
very
least
its
an
acceptably
mediocre
ambervienna
not
bad
but
i
dont
see
much
reason
to
pick
this
up
over
sa
boston
lager
which
is
cleaner
crisper
easier
to
drink
and
available
everywhere
pours
a
clear
orange
with
a
foamy
beige
head
that
settles
to
wisps
of
film
on
top
of
the
beer
no
lacing
on
the
drink
down
smell
is
of
malt
spice
and
scented
baby
wipe
aromas
taste
is
much
the
same
with
malt
and
spice
flavors
on
the
finish
there
is
a
mild
amount
of
hop
bitterness
on
the
palate
with
each
sip
this
beer
has
a
lower
level
of
carbonation
with
a
slightly
crisp
mouthfeel
overall
this
is
an
above
average
beer
with
an
odd
smell
but
the
taste
is
decent
enough
if
only
id
brought
an
extra
bottle
or
two
of
this
home
with
me
for
when
i
was
watching
the
super
bowl
or
john
cusacks
performance
in
the
raven
regardless
this
stuff
pours
a
clear
pale
sunset
brass
topped
by
a
finger
of
lightly
offwhite
foam
the
nose
comprises
mild
biscuit
and
very
light
flowers
i
think
i
get
some
hard
water
but
that
may
be
from
the
glass
my
apartments
water
is
harder
than
bricks
the
taste
brings
in
more
of
the
same
along
with
a
few
drops
of
honeylike
sweetness
peeking
through
from
time
to
time
the
body
straddles
the
line
between
hefty
light
and
light
medium
with
a
light
moderate
carbonation
and
a
sortakinda
drying
finish
overall
a
nice
if
nondescript
little
beer
nothing
worth
sneezing
at
and
nothing
bad
enough
to
wipe
your
nose
on
worth
a
go
at
least
o
this
is
essentially
a
runofthemill
lager
while
its
nothing
special
i
will
admit
that
this
one
boasts
more
flavor
and
goes
down
easier
than
most
of
the
massproduced
lagers
for
me
this
is
nothing
more
than
something
id
bring
a
sixpack
or
two
to
a
party
full
of
people
that
dont
really
go
for
the
crafts
its
nothing
id
recommend
to
anyone
unless
they
were
looking
for
a
decent
replacement
for
the
massproduced
lagers
and
light
beers
o
just
a
typical
lager
nothing
i
would
grab
again
t
metallic
aftertaste
almost
a
eurostrong
but
without
the
abv
barley
is
of
a
darker
roast
that
i
would
have
expected
cool
bottle
looks
ok
when
poured
typical
euro
pale
lager
nose
is
too
close
to
the
bad
adjunct
world
taste
is
a
bit
sweet
malty
with
not
enough
hop
balance
flows
down
the
gullet
fine
past
the
palate
nothing
special
actually
less
i
prefer
the
gusto
schlitz
or
speaking
of
baltimore
natty
boh
pours
a
clear
golden
color
with
a
nice
white
head
and
just
a
touch
of
lacing
on
the
edges
the
nose
has
a
bit
of
light
grain
faint
hops
and
just
a
touch
of
sweetness
the
flavor
is
a
really
nice
balance
between
light
malt
and
very
mild
sweetness
just
a
touch
of
grain
flavor
as
well
light
body
with
good
carbonation
and
just
a
bit
of
chewiness
altogether
really
a
nice
lager
overall
not
bad
i
was
expecting
worse
just
a
slight
metallic
flavor
otherwise
no
real
off
flavors
but
no
crisp
or
clean
lager
flavors
either
pours
amber
with
white
fluffy
head
about
one
finger
that
dissipates
quickly
very
floral
nose
with
a
hint
of
some
roasted
malts
in
the
background
but
very
faint
on
those
bitter
flavor
with
some
malt
backgrounds
no
real
detection
of
the
floral
aromas
i
was
getting
in
the
taste
defiantly
lingers
on
the
palette
with
a
pungent
flavor
this
is
a
good
strong
lager
but
doesnt
have
any
thing
too
interesting
about
it
other
than
the
box
it
comes
in
not
a
bad
little
beer
but
a
little
to
pricey
for
the
novelty
when
it
is
a
pretty
standard
brew
poured
a
clear
burnt
umber
with
a
small
offwhite
head
that
dissipated
quickly
grains
and
toasted
malts
in
the
aroma
toasty
malts
in
the
taste
grainy
woody
with
some
caramel
sweetness
some
hop
bitterness
comes
in
towards
the
end
leaving
a
dry
and
somewhat
bland
aftertaste
still
an
overall
ok
brew
lightmedium
mouthfeel
and
pretty
drinkable
though
after
the
fest
i
never
saw
the
stuff
again
overall
is
isnt
a
bad
brew
nice
clean
flavors
really
refreshing
and
sessionable
i
would
drink
this
again
for
sure
d
pretty
boring
beer
fitting
right
in
with
the
style
probably
has
one
of
the
coolest
bottle
caps
with
a
pic
of
edgar
allen
poe
on
it
this
beer
pours
a
clear
rust
color
with
halfinch
head
that
fades
quickly
the
aroma
has
a
balance
of
dough
maple
and
grass
its
flavor
begins
with
caramel
followed
by
maple
honey
and
orange
notes
it
has
just
enough
hops
to
give
a
good
balance
the
mouthfeel
is
slightly
thin
but
smooth
providing
for
a
high
drinkability
recommended
o
this
beer
should
be
called
never
more
i
think
this
beer
has
to
be
older
which
is
why
i
am
not
digging
it
the
abv
is
low
to
have
a
great
many
pints
of
this
but
then
again
why
would
you
if
this
is
how
it
was
suppose
to
taste
oh
well
you
win
some
and
lose
some
d
decently
complements
any
meal
as
long
as
the
meal
itself
is
much
more
flavorful
and
can
hold
its
own
d
average
about
sums
it
up
nothing
to
bring
you
back
despite
flaws
not
a
badtasting
beer
at
least
for
a
maltlover
like
me
but
well
why
not
to
rule
things
out
but
to
quoth
the
raven
nevermore
all
in
all
i
was
a
little
disappointed
with
the
raven
perhaps
living
near
baltimore
i
hoped
that
they
would
do
more
of
a
service
to
edgar
allan
poe
certainly
a
drinkable
lager
but
nothing
really
sticks
out
this
beer
pours
with
a
nice
amber
colour
but
mine
ran
out
of
head
in
about
10
seconds
and
had
very
little
carbonation
it
had
a
weak
but
nice
smell
of
honey
on
toast
it
has
a
decent
taste
but
nothing
stands
out
slightly
hoppy
and
bitter
my
bottle
was
very
flat
in
the
mouth
its
a
very
drinkable
beer
but
there
is
nothing
noteworthy
about
it
except
the
branding
huge
edgar
allan
poe
fan
so
tried
the
beer
overall
i
was
satisfied
but
not
wowed
definitely
comparable
to
stella
artois
well
balanced
beer
but
lacks
creativeness
nothing
stands
out
to
me
nice
label
if
you
like
the
poem
you
should
at
least
try
the
beer
i
had
to
have
it
because
of
the
poe
beer
cap
nice
touch
oh
well
try
it
if
you
get
a
change
its
worth
it
highly
drinkable
medium
bodied
beer
overall
its
really
nice
sweet
slightly
and
finishes
nice
i
think
its
ok
just
a
basic
nofrills
lager
here
but
easy
to
drink
we
expected
more
from
the
head
and
mouthfeel
both
of
which
suffered
all
around
but
balance
and
con
sistent
flavor
made
up
for
that
not
a
bad
pick
if
youre
into
middleoftheroad
lagers
for
the
pairing
throw
this
one
at
a
pulledpork
sandwich
with
pickles
and
slaw
d
i
could
see
this
being
a
session
beer
if
nothing
else
was
available
serving
type
bottle
a
clear
copper
color
pour
with
a
small
white
head
medium
to
light
carbonation
aroma
is
light
with
a
touch
of
grass
some
sweet
clean
malt
garin
very
faint
floral
hop
notes
flavor
is
very
balanced
slightly
bready
malt
with
just
a
bit
of
hops
to
even
things
out
very
clean
crisp
mouthfeel
light
body
a
very
sessionable
brew
with
no
huge
flavors
or
aromas
yet
pretty
darn
good
d
for
a
relatively
basic
lager
theres
a
lot
going
on
here
most
of
it
good
some
of
it
not
so
much
a
touch
metallic
and
vegetal
at
times
but
its
got
some
character
solid
and
respectable
d
i
view
this
as
the
dave
matthews
band
of
beers
competent
but
boring
i
wouldnt
be
upset
if
i
never
drank
it
again
for
the
rest
of
my
life
but
i
wouldnt
have
a
problem
drinking
it
if
i
went
somewhere
where
it
was
the
only
beer
available
the
drinkability
is
extremely
high
i
would
love
to
have
more
of
this
beer
thats
a
great
sign
that
its
drinkable
if
you
see
this
one
buy
a
sixer
and
send
me
at
least
2
d
i
had
about
6
and
wasnt
excitd
just
satisfied
with
an
acceptable
lager
a
clear
golden
in
color
with
no
real
head
no
real
smell
very
neutral
in
taste
not
a
bad
beer
just
nothing
that
exciting
easy
drinking
i
dont
know
that
i
would
have
it
again
for
i
know
many
more
lagers
that
have
more
taste
this
is
well
balanced
and
no
real
negatives
to
this
beer
well
im
not
sure
if
im
board
in
calling
this
a
euro
pale
lager
definitely
seems
to
be
closer
to
a
marzen
or
oktoberfest
to
me
given
the
fairly
deep
amber
color
and
strong
malty
flavors
in
any
case
got
it
cause
it
was
cheap
and
i
hadnt
tried
it
before
although
quite
honestly
i
should
have
gone
with
the
sn
celebration
for
a
dollar
more
pours
an
amber
color
with
a
smallish
big
bubbled
head
that
dissolves
fast
nose
is
mild
malt
a
touch
of
graininess
flavor
is
much
better
if
still
fairly
mild
sweet
and
slightly
spicy
malt
graininess
and
a
bit
earthy
some
light
fruity
flavors
body
is
light
with
fairly
sprightly
carbonation
overall
not
terrible
although
definitely
nothing
too
exciting
either
a
weak
marzen
or
a
good
euro
pale
lager
in
any
case
a
fairly
mediocre
beer
thats
highly
drinkable
pours
a
burnt
flesh
orange
in
color
with
no
head
at
all
plenty
of
carbonation
running
up
the
glass
smell
is
slightly
malty
and
openly
fresh
not
as
bad
as
i
expected
flavor
is
clean
and
slightly
floral
a
bit
of
black
pepper
spice
in
the
taste
very
light
and
clean
in
the
mouthfeel
i
think
this
is
slightly
better
than
what
i
was
expecting
drinkability
easy
drinking
beer
enjoyed
this
one
for
this
style
for
starters
and
i
think
this
is
what
makes
the
difference
between
average
and
good
pale
lagers
theres
absolutely
nothing
offensive
about
this
beer
it
reminded
me
of
a
blander
version
of
full
sails
session
the
aroma
is
faint
but
its
the
same
as
the
taste
with
smooth
sweet
bready
malts
with
just
the
slightest
toasted
note
no
hops
just
a
balanced
lager
were
talking
throwback
lager
here
great
for
the
style
is
this
just
a
microbeer
in
balty
or
is
it
actually
made
only
for
the
raven
in
va
beach
thats
how
that
restaurant
sells
the
beer
at
least
on
the
menu
a
dark
orange
seethru
body
with
one
finger
head
that
died
quickyl
a
slightly
hoppy
smell
with
some
citric
and
flower
notes
along
with
hints
of
sweet
malt
a
bit
of
malt
taste
along
with
light
floral
hops
in
the
taste
mixed
ok
and
rather
faint
has
some
crispness
in
the
medium
body
too
like
sour
apple
and
a
semidry
backbite
tasted
like
any
other
euro
macro
lager
maybe
a
bit
better
and
when
im
at
the
raven
again
ill
stick
to
their
world
famous
mudslide
a
decent
lager
nothing
special
but
good
if
youre
looking
for
something
quaffable
picked
up
a
few
of
these
at
the
raven
restaurant
in
virginia
beach
va
and
drank
it
out
of
a
pilsner
glass
poured
to
a
small
head
that
quickly
dissipated
no
lacing
and
has
a
very
pleasing
goldenamber
color
decently
carbonated
and
a
little
champagne
like
in
that
fact
this
is
an
extremely
drinkable
beer
and
is
gone
before
you
know
it
slight
sweetness
of
caramel
first
hits
you
palate
followed
by
a
small
hint
of
hops
this
is
a
very
good
beer
for
people
that
want
to
make
the
jump
into
craft
beer
very
smooth
d
ones
enough
a
good
tweener
intro
beer
into
the
micro
world
but
really
falls
short
in
satisfying
the
more
experienced
palate
per
style
ive
had
this
beer
on
draft
on
two
seperate
occasions
it
is
definitely
not
going
to
knock
your
socks
off
but
it
drinks
very
nicely
and
way
to
easily
the
color
was
a
pale
orange
amber
with
a
cream
head
you
could
pick
up
on
a
nice
balance
of
hops
and
malts
like
a
pale
lager
should
have
this
is
very
drinkable
probably
a
good
4th
of
july
or
memorial
day
beer
something
you
could
drink
most
of
the
day
with
some
pacing
d
this
is
a
decent
relatively
light
lager
its
not
the
one
i
would
pick
if
i
were
looking
for
a
very
fresh
refreshing
beer
but
if
i
wanted
just
a
little
more
character
than
that
but
not
quite
as
much
as
say
a
typical
vienna
lager
this
would
be
a
good
choice
orange
colored
lager
with
a
head
that
fades
to
nothing
very
quickly
smell
is
sweet
and
citrusytaste
is
citrus
and
malt
i
cant
really
say
if
i
would
recommend
this
or
notthere
is
nothing
that
springs
out
at
you
that
would
make
me
want
to
try
another
incredibly
average
lager
this
is
a
very
drinkable
brew
some
brews
make
me
glad
i
only
bought
a
single
this
one
makes
me
glad
i
bought
a
sixpack
i
dont
love
this
beer
but
for
a
run
of
the
mill
lager
its
quite
good
and
distinct
im
glad
the
brewery
didnt
sully
the
name
of
such
a
famous
author
and
drinker
with
a
crap
beer
worth
a
shot
drinkability
i
think
that
this
is
my
favorite
of
the
style
so
far
imo
it
has
more
character
and
depth
then
most
other
examples
of
this
style
d
refreshing
a
decent
lager
all
in
all
balanced
enough
for
drinking
throughout
a
session
not
a
bad
choice
for
an
easydrinking
sweeter
nobrainer
beer
but
nothing
exciting
or
memorable
by
any
means
imo
drinkability
inoffensive
is
perhaps
the
best
that
can
be
said
slightly
sweet
and
easy
to
drink
but
not
worth
seeking
out
rapping
at
my
chamber
door
tasted
again
for
the
first
time
something
ive
tried
before
but
hadnt
had
it
in
a
long
time
a
friend
said
he
tried
it
at
the
firkin
festival
and
it
was
one
of
his
favoriteseven
among
all
the
dozens
of
others
available
on
tap
so
i
bought
some
again
poured
nice
ambergold
in
the
glass
with
a
hint
of
haze
and
a
short
head
of
foam
that
dissipated
quickly
definitely
smooth
and
slick
with
a
moderate
body
and
light
carbonation
nailed
the
lager
profile
right
on
the
head
hint
of
sweet
malt
in
the
nose
with
a
rich
germanstyle
pale
roundness
not
much
in
the
way
of
off
flavors
and
just
a
hint
of
hops
offering
a
nice
balanced
bitterness
on
the
back
of
the
tongue
so
extremely
drinkable
very
nice
indeed
and
very
fresh
tasting
since
its
made
locally
glad
i
tried
it
ill
have
to
take
some
to
tailgate
at
the
ravens
game
next
week
id
drink
it
again
but
not
right
away
could
be
a
adequate
lawnmower
beer
poured
a
cloudy
red
with
a
foamy
head
that
quickly
dissipated
smelled
toasty
and
a
little
sweet
wellbalanced
aroma
initially
a
slightly
hoppy
kick
with
a
warmingsweet
flavor
going
down
a
roastedmaltiness
in
the
aftertaste
very
drinkable
this
could
be
a
great
everyday
beer
drinkability
very
drinkable
very
solid
for
a
macro
this
is
certainly
a
stepup
from
budweiser
and
considering
the
extra
buck
and
half
in
price
for
a
sixpack
i
think
its
certainly
worth
it
poured
a
crystal
clear
medium
copper
color
with
modest
slightly
offwhite
puffy
head
nice
lacing
as
the
head
slowly
fell
to
a
thin
ring
smell
is
a
pleasant
combination
of
maltiness
and
sweet
fruit
taste
has
a
frim
malty
character
with
a
nice
balancing
amount
of
hops
full
creamy
mouthfeel
very
drinkable
an
excellent
macro
lager
this
is
what
they
should
all
taste
like
pours
a
nice
clear
copper
with
an
offwhite
head
aroma
is
mainly
sweet
bready
malts
with
a
slight
hint
of
hops
flavor
is
along
the
same
lines
mostly
malty
with
faint
fruity
hops
trying
to
make
their
presence
known
mouthfeel
is
ok
nothing
spectactular
average
lager
that
goes
down
easy
sums
this
one
up
12
ounce
bottle
the
taste
is
poetic
label
and
an
edgar
allen
poe
bottlecap
it
poured
a
dark
gold
with
an
off
white
head
the
aroma
was
of
good
malt
the
taste
was
fairly
malty
with
a
light
hop
finish
the
feel
was
med
and
dry
a
resonable
beer
overall
a
decent
lager
im
not
unimpressed
it
would
certainly
be
good
on
a
hot
day
sampled
this
at
a
festival
which
is
the
only
place
i
ever
see
this
beer
pours
a
clear
golden
orange
with
a
good
bit
of
carbonation
visible
and
a
full
finger
of
head
nose
is
weak
and
uninteresting
malty
with
the
unpleasant
corn
aroma
of
an
adjunct
lager
taste
was
simple
but
goodstrong
malts
with
hints
of
caramel
and
just
the
faintest
bit
of
hops
bitterness
which
surprised
me
the
mouthfeel
is
soft
and
smooth
and
it
finishes
with
a
light
malty
aftertaste
as
someone
who
swore
off
beer
for
years
because
i
had
only
tasted
american
lagers
and
despised
the
taste
i
must
say
that
this
is
far
and
away
the
best
of
the
style
ive
ever
had
a
taste
of
that
being
said
there
are
still
a
lot
better
more
flavorful
beers
out
there
and
i
wont
be
buying
this
any
time
soon
mouthfeel
was
smooth
with
a
light
crispness
at
the
start
and
finish
the
caramel
tones
lingered
softly
on
the
tongue
drinkability
is
decent
not
a
beer
to
go
searching
for
but
not
a
bad
offering
at
a
bar
that
only
has
other
macros
good
beer
that
i
would
recommend
highly
ive
seen
this
beer
in
6packs
during
prior
trips
to
virginia
but
it
never
looked
fresh
and
the
bottles
were
not
dated
this
month
i
saw
it
in
cases
at
a
total
wine
store
and
was
able
to
read
a
date
on
the
case
my
6pack
lived
up
to
that
dating
it
was
definitely
fresh
and
refreshing
nice
color
good
head
and
lace
soft
mouthfeel
and
pleasant
malty
aftertaste
i
doubt
this
product
sells
in
much
quantity
as
its
a
limited
contract
brew
nonetheless
i
thought
it
to
be
a
very
acceptable
sessiontype
lager
and
will
be
happy
to
purchase
it
again
on
a
future
trip
if
i
can
find
another
fresh
6pack
have
never
seen
it
outside
of
maryland
and
virginia
this
beer
is
contract
brewed
at
the
clipper
city
brewing
company
in
baltimore
it
pours
a
clear
deepamber
body
with
an
orange
cast
steadily
rising
bubbles
can
clearly
be
seen
adding
to
the
foamy
white
cap
that
holds
well
and
maintains
a
thin
surface
covering
throughout
the
first
half
of
the
glass
the
nose
delivers
a
sweetish
caramel
malt
thats
infused
with
lightly
floral
hops
the
body
is
medium
and
its
smooth
in
the
mouth
with
a
very
fine
moderate
carbonation
that
gently
tingles
the
tongue
the
flavor
offers
a
rich
sweetish
malt
that
indicates
the
use
of
munich
and
perhap
crystal
malts
its
balanced
by
a
firm
bitterness
and
infused
with
lightly
floral
hops
and
finishes
soft
and
smooth
with
some
residual
malt
and
a
light
touch
of
hop
flavor
not
a
bad
brew
to
try
but
one
ive
tried
a
few
different
times
and
its
never
really
caught
on
not
one
id
buy
but
also
not
one
id
turn
down
o
pretty
decent
session
beer
and
fairly
refreshing
good
if
you
are
looking
for
refreshment
and
dont
want
to
get
too
drunk
o
not
one
that
i
will
revisit
and
im
kinda
upset
because
ive
been
waiting
to
try
this
powdery
yeast
and
burnt
herbs
with
a
roughly
put
together
the
flavors
are
there
but
the
execution
was
off
this
was
better
than
the
one
i
had
a
few
years
ago
maybe
the
the
other
one
was
old
but
it
was
awful
this
one
however
was
pretty
tasty
and
well
balanced
a
little
rough
around
the
edges
but
in
a
good
way
an
excellent
session
beer
that
i
could
drink
all
night
long
o
decent
lager
offering
d
good
local
not
out
of
this
world
a
good
session
beer
that
tastes
fresh
the
label
artwork
looks
great
this
year
d
decent
drinker
unoffensive
just
a
tad
sweet
for
my
taste
great
drinkability
not
a
perfect
vienna
lager
but
acquits
itself
very
well
this
will
go
into
the
fall
rotation
when
ever
i
can
pick
this
up
was
pleasantly
suprised
by
this
this
was
better
than
most
of
the
ofestsviennas
ive
had
this
fall
the
look
of
the
beer
may
be
the
one
thing
choc
got
right
on
this
one
it
is
dark
and
inviting
and
despite
the
sweet
smell
you
get
you
could
easily
mistake
a
glass
of
this
to
be
an
actual
malty
oktoberfest
brew
by
appearance
alone
the
taste
is
what
destroys
this
beer
though
and
thats
a
pretty
important
category
in
my
book
the
beer
contains
very
little
malt
or
malt
that
one
can
really
taste
and
decipher
and
a
whole
lot
of
sweetness
with
little
to
no
bitterness
the
brew
actually
tastes
more
like
a
sweetened
ice
tea
than
a
märzen
or
even
a
quality
lager
this
is
the
worst
choc
beer
that
ive
ever
consumed
more
bite
and
a
lot
less
sweetness
would
go
a
long
way
towards
improving
this
one
hope
this
was
just
a
bad
bottlebatch
some
additional
lagering
time
and
better
fermentation
control
would
go
a
long
way
i
wont
be
picking
up
another
bottle
but
its
decent
enough
for
a
hot
summer
afternoon
spent
watching
some
tv
poured
a
dark
golden
color
smells
like
tart
apples
tastes
like
tart
apples
and
a
bit
metallic
mouthfeel
is
good
though
medium
overall
its
the
same
flavors
that
i
get
from
most
of
the
choc
line
that
i
dont
like
tart
apples
and
metal
i
really
want
to
love
this
brewery
since
its
local
but
havent
found
anything
yet
that
i
can
get
excited
about
but
i
will
keep
searching
drinkability
petes
place
along
with
siletz
and
northwoods
is
quickly
becoming
ingrained
in
my
mind
as
brewery
with
infection
issues
what
a
shame
pours
a
clear
copper
color
with
a
small
offwhite
head
that
quickly
dissipates
smells
of
sweet
fruits
like
plums
and
apricots
with
some
mild
floral
notes
present
first
sip
is
fresh
and
clean
but
like
other
beers
from
petes
place
there
is
just
not
enough
flavor
present
the
flavor
that
is
there
is
good
just
not
enough
of
it
it
is
clean
and
refreshing
but
nothing
special
dnot
my
favorite
style
to
begin
with
but
save
for
the
light
mouthfeel
this
one
has
a
nice
sour
tinged
roasted
caramel
malt
flavour
at
least
enough
to
hold
my
interest
overall
this
is
a
pretty
solid
vienna
lager
i
wish
more
widely
available
lagers
tasted
this
good
its
that
time
of
year
again
and
you
can
smell
autumn
in
the
air
this
has
always
been
my
favorite
time
made
even
better
by
one
of
my
favorite
local
breweries
rolling
out
their
munich
lager
this
is
a
hazy
light
brown
brew
with
a
onefinger
topping
of
offwhite
head
retention
is
adequate
and
a
thin
layer
of
bubble
specked
lacing
is
left
behind
it
actually
mells
earthy
and
hoppy
up
front
with
a
good
layer
of
sweet
malt
and
caramel
underneath
it
all
which
makes
for
a
good
combo
the
taste
is
more
mellow
than
the
aroma
but
still
not
bad
hints
of
sweet
malts
candy
and
a
little
spice
exist
some
very
mild
fruitiness
lurks
down
below
everything
carbonation
is
evident
only
after
a
good
shake
this
one
goes
down
extra
smooth
secondary
to
its
light
bodied
mouthfeel
this
is
a
good
session
beer
to
help
you
welcome
in
the
season
prosit
this
beer
pours
a
cloudy
brown
color
with
a
huge
creamy
head
that
leaves
a
ton
of
lace
the
smell
could
almost
be
considerd
a
malt
bomb
super
sweet
malt
character
has
an
almost
nutty
flavor
at
times
the
taste
has
almost
too
much
malt
sweetness
to
it
for
my
liking
this
beer
has
a
nice
smoothness
to
it
most
likely
from
the
bottle
conditioning
not
a
bad
beer
of
all
the
us
made
oktoberfest
beers
it
reminds
me
most
of
st
arnolds
version
nothing
like
the
german
versions
but
thats
ok
between
the
2
beers
i
have
tried
from
petes
place
this
one
was
the
clear
winner
the
other
beer
being
choc
original
it
seemed
to
be
a
good
single
bottle
beer
i
tried
one
bottle
right
after
eating
and
was
not
that
impessed
but
i
had
another
bottle
while
working
on
an
art
project
in
which
i
had
not
eaten
or
had
drunk
anything
for
quite
some
time
and
was
pretty
blown
away
by
the
flavor
of
this
local
brew
the
second
time
around
was
much
better
pours
a
cloudy
dark
orange
color
nice
carbonation
very
nice
thick
creamy
offwhite
head
tons
of
creamy
sticky
lacing
follows
the
nose
is
malty
slightly
spicy
and
a
good
dose
of
caramel
the
taste
is
slightly
sweet
malty
spicy
and
some
caramel
medium
body
very
drinkable
this
is
a
very
tasty
vienna
lager
would
buy
if
it
was
available
in
my
area
recommended
pours
a
dark
orange
hazy
from
being
unfiltered
has
a
large
tan
head
smells
earthy
taste
is
quite
smooth
almost
has
a
lemony
citrus
like
taste
a
bit
tart
and
metallic
too
almost
has
an
ale
like
quality
very
unique
for
a
lager
good
mouthfeel
carbonation
is
good
quite
drinkable
too
i
could
drink
several
of
these
bonus
points
for
being
bottle
conditioned
i
dont
think
ive
had
a
bottle
conditioned
lager
before
so
this
is
pretty
cool
d
overall
not
bad
i
didnt
expect
much
so
i
was
very
pleasantly
surprised
would
make
a
fine
session
beer
thanks
to
beertracker
who
id
like
to
do
another
trade
with
in
the
fall
as
id
like
to
try
this
again
when
its
fresh
as
it
has
something
to
it
not
a
bad
beer
but
it
is
merely
average
compared
to
other
octoberfest
beers
this
is
another
good
brew
from
petes
place
and
i
really
cant
decide
if
i
like
choc
or
chocotoberfest
more
this
beer
has
a
very
good
amberbrown
hazy
appearance
since
its
unfiltered
the
very
large
foamy
head
that
leaves
a
good
amount
of
lacing
i
loved
the
texture
of
the
head
the
beer
has
a
nice
malty
flavor
which
is
followed
by
a
nice
touch
of
hops
overall
a
very
tasty
brew
thanks
beerhandy
for
the
opportunity
d
i
plan
on
buying
a
few
more
mostly
i
think
this
beer
has
suffered
in
the
bottle
some
it
has
low
carbonation
and
that
really
effects
the
rest
of
the
perception
of
this
beer
so
i
only
punished
it
in
the
mouthfeel
as
it
still
smells
really
good
like
sweet
wort
with
a
mince
of
german
hops
and
a
light
touch
of
alcohol
the
taste
is
how
i
prefer
my
octoberfest
beers
a
little
on
the
sweet
side
full
of
caramel
and
toasty
flavors
good
stuff
i
think
it
would
be
better
on
tap
poured
into
an
imperial
pint
glass
formed
a
12
light
tan
head
above
the
clear
orangey
amber
brew
head
fades
quickly
down
to
an
even
layer
of
bubbles
with
average
lacing
aroma
is
balanced
with
a
tending
towards
grain
hulls
taste
follows
the
nose
but
with
a
bit
more
tart
fruitiness
in
the
middle
as
i
would
wantexpect
closes
slightly
chalky
mouthfeel
and
drinkability
not
too
bad
but
this
one
kind
of
let
me
down
in
the
end
pours
to
a
clear
light
amber
color
if
you
pour
carefullly
off
the
sediment
and
permanent
white
head
aroma
is
malty
and
a
bit
sharp
is
there
wheat
in
there
with
caramel
notes
flavor
is
semidry
and
malt
oriented
with
no
discernable
hop
character
other
than
balacing
bitterness
finishes
dry
and
malty
mouthfeel
is
a
bit
thin
and
fizzy
this
is
a
bottleconditioned
maltoriented
amber
lager
with
a
distinctive
original
chocbeer
personality
not
an
extraordinary
beer
but
a
solid
citizen
nonetheless
pours
a
amber
color
with
medium
thin
head
aroma
is
weak
but
of
caramel
and
some
floral
hops
taste
is
a
nice
roasted
malt
followed
up
with
a
decent
amount
of
sweetness
a
bit
of
orange
and
grassy
hops
is
also
evident
it
is
light
on
the
palate
with
a
longlasting
sweet
aftertaste
a
nice
example
of
a
vienna
lager
beer
itself
is
quite
smooth
sweet
upfront
no
bitterness
at
all
really
high
mouthfeel
pretty
thick
a
little
too
thick
finishes
nicely
and
no
aftertaste
drinkability
is
high
really
high
i
would
definitely
order
this
again
i
bet
this
would
be
better
fresh
and
with
a
little
more
carbonation
edit
if
you
are
thinking
about
buying
this
beer
for
the
bottles
dont
let
the
c
discourage
you
the
beer
is
ok
and
i
will
drink
them
it
just
realy
isnt
anything
at
all
to
write
home
about
overall
this
beer
has
a
complexity
that
makes
it
definitely
worth
trying
every
sip
seems
to
bring
about
a
slightly
different
dimension
although
there
is
nothing
that
is
particularly
surprising
about
it
i
would
purchase
it
again
color
is
relatively
clear
slightly
hazed
copper
color
very
weak
off
white
head
that
retains
what
little
body
it
has
and
leaves
very
few
spots
of
lacing
fairly
sweet
nose
caramel
and
toasted
malt
maybe
some
slight
diacetyl
creamy
smooth
body
with
light
carbonation
and
finish
of
slight
hop
bitterness
flavor
again
has
a
slight
diacetyl
presence
which
is
distracting
regardless
flavor
has
strong
toasted
malt
backbone
light
grain
flavors
but
overall
just
feels
flat
and
lifeless
not
bad
but
a
little
more
carbonation
would
help
drinkability
is
hurt
by
diacetyl
presence

simple

good
overall
a
decent
one
but
not
the
best
from

d
id
call
it
thirstquenching
not
bad
for
one
or
two
on
a
hot
a
saturday
afternoon
in
the
summer
but
id
generally
choose
something
else
were
the
selection
better
d
an
easy

beer
sweet

and
no
problem
going
down
would
definitely
buy
and
try

d
i
suppose
this
would
be
ok
on
a
hot
day
out
of
a
cooler
or
if
you
want
a
semicool
bottle
drinkability
is
great
i
cant
say
that
id
drink
this
all
day
but
its
very
easy
to
drink
the
sweetness
isnt
overbearing
to
me
like
a
tripel
but
very
light
very
easy
to
drink
a
few
of
and
pairs
very
well
with
everything
ive
had
it
with
a
great
lunchtimesandwich
beer
d
this
is
a
nice
drinkable
beer
but
i
think
after
two
one
would
be
looking
for
something
new
thats
a
little
more
alive
on
the
palate
i
enjoyed
this
one
and
will
drink
it
again
overall
i
enjoyed
the
quality
and
especially
the
choice
of
hops
good
drinkability
overall
and
worth
a
try
if
you
like
a
good
lager
d
well
worth
the
4pk
5l
swing
top
i
purchased
im
getting
more
and
some
of
there
other
offerings
d
i
suppose
this
would
be
ok
on
a
hot
day
out
of
a
cooler
if
you
wanted
to
impress
budswilling
friends
but
thats
about
it
overall
below
average
and
not
really
worth
you
time
or
money
wont
kill
you
though
a
great
vienna
picked
up
in
batavia
creamy
head
with
dark
chocolate
and
maltinessnuts
and
coconuts
and
in
the
mouthfeel
smooth
drinker
though
on
the
chocolate
milk
feeling
bitterness
right
at
the
end
much
was
done
with
little
the
purity
laws
this
beer
poured
a
redtinted
copper
color
with
a
singlefinger
head
the
smell
is
mostly
malt
sweetness
with
a
hoppy
undertone
the
taste
starts
off
with
some
nice
malty
sweetness
thats
cut
by
a
small
amount
of
hops
and
finishes
with
an
almost
nuttiness
thats
very
tasty
the
mouthfeel
is
smooth
with
a
middling
amount
of
carbonation
its
a
nice
drinkable
beer
and
i
could
see
myself
having
a
couple
in
a
row
not
much
else
to
say
on
this
one
i
will
buy
it
again
but
sporadically
this
is
only
my
2nd
schwelmer
brew
and
so
far
i
am
not
overly
impressed
but
i
am
glad
they
are
actually
available
in
boise
drinkability
well
worth
trying
probably
the
best
vienna
lager
ive
had
outside
of
germany
pours
a
slightly
clouded
gold
with
a
crème
head
that
was
big
off
an
aggressive
pour
but
came
down
fairly
quickly
nose
is
mild
with
a
slight
malt
presence
and
cereal
tone
as
well
not
a
lot
to
it
though
flavor
is
medium
bodied
i
would
say
slight
robust
edge
to
it
and
a
peppery
spicy
bite
on
the
tongue
as
well
feel
is
pretty
standard
drinkable
as
an
average
brew
nothing
to
write
home
about
or
ever
return
to
again
nothing
too
impressive
but
worth
a
shot
drinkability
this
beer
is
nothing
special
for
the
price
but
it
does
go
down
easy
and
has
cool
bottle
headless
horseman
color
and
smell
are
coppery
like
a
penny
looks
kinda
like
carbonated
iced
tea
taste
is
better
until
the
aftertaste
which
is
metallic
and
unpleasant
if
i
were
in
one
of
my
moods
i
would
crucify
this
beer
thing
is
the
taste
is
pretty
good
until
the
aftertaste
but
the
aftertaste
is
among
the
worst
ive
ever
experienced
if
this
were
a
high
gravity
beer
i
would
probably
drain
it
to
spare
my
sobriety
but
dammit
i
dont
know
what
else
to
say
this
beer
is
almost
good
but
it
sucks
and
my
teeth
hurt
tastes
like
fillings
and
flat
cola
yeah
thats
it
reminds
me
of
getting
fillings
which
from
my
standpoint
tends
to
detract
from
a
beers
drinkability
yeah
this
is
garbage
worst
beer
ive
had
since
that
stupid
root
beer
jim
koch
pissed
out
last
year
ugh
its
a
great
tasting
fruity
flavorful
beer
this
is
full
and
lite
similar
to
a
flavor
explosion
good
full
feeling
that
goes
down
smooth
only
lacking
in
that
it
is
almost
sort
of
flat
this
is
very
smooth
summertime
beer
good
alternative
to
the
german
hefeweizen
pours
a
very
light
sunset
burnt
orange
with
a
nice
two
finger
white
head
that
quickly
dies
down
to
a
tiny
layer
stickiness
is
nonexistant
but
this
seems
to
be
the
case
for
lagers
smell
is
a
buttery
yeast
some
caramel
malt
sweet
honey
and
the
tiniest
bit
of
noble
hops
taste
is
a
cleancrisp
bready
malt
with
a
hint
of
bitterness
midway
through
aftertaste
is
a
honey
sweetness
with
a
bit
of
salty
butter
mouthfeel
is
light
bodied
with
a
fair
amount
of
carbonation
that
leaves
an
unexpected
dry
mouth
pretty
good
beer
that
goes
down
quite
easily
i
first
tried
this
one
at
the
ba
german
beer
fest
a
few
weeks
ago
and
had
to
pick
up
a
bottle
good
solid
lager
give
it
a
try
for
sure
this
is
one
of
my
favorites
in
a
bottle
has
a
rich
taste
that
has
always
been
as
fresh
tasting
as
any
bottled
beer
i
have
had
definite
must
to
try
taste
is
malty
and
the
beer
has
some
bitterness
which
is
nicely
balanced
the
beer
has
some
dextrinous
characteristics
which
give
the
beer
a
sweet
and
slightly
sticky
mouthfeel
body
is
medium
and
drinkability
is
good
drinkability
just
too
flawed
by
the
diacetyl
for
me
to
recommend
this
plainish
german
lager
with
some
caramel
grains
it
reminds
me
of
a
euro
pale
lager
with
slightly
darker
grains
like
a
dumbed
down
amber
ale
there
isnt
much
of
a
hops
profile
and
the
malt
isnt
too
special
its
still
smooth
and
somewhat
tasty
not
to
bad
drinkabilityoverall
a
nice
malty
fairly
tasty
little
vienna
nothing
outstanding
but
entirely
drinkable
and
smooth
going
down
failry
easy
enough
to
drink
but
boring
poured
a
clear
light
amber
color
with
an
average
offwhite
head
that
left
some
light
lacing
as
it
dissipated
the
smell
is
not
very
distinct
it
has
a
light
pilsner
hop
smell
peppery
no
real
hop
in
the
taste
has
some
smooth
caramel
maltiness
to
it
the
feel
is
light
and
dry
and
finishes
bitter
not
a
bad
offering
worth
a
sampling
not
sure
if
would
venture
out
for
it
drinks
alright
a
very
basic
vienna
nothing
to
get
worked
up
about
this
beer
poured
an
amber
gold
with
a
half
inch
of
eggshell
head
the
aroma
is
of
mild
husky
and
vaguely
toasty
malt
and
a
slight
herbal
hop
the
taste
is
of
grainy
husky
bisquity
and
slightly
musty
malt
qualities
with
some
more
herbal
mildly
grassy
and
bitter
hop
flavor
too
balance
its
a
very
well
balanced
and
easy
drinking
brew
and
the
flavors
are
quite
pleasant
but
they
are
just
a
tad
bit
underwhelming
or
fleeting
definatly
a
decent
brew
to
quaff
i
can
think
of
much
worse
beer
to
be
imbibing
on
this
night
i
poured
this
half
liter
flip
top
bottle
into
a
glass
beer
mug
i
pours
a
clean
straw
yellow
very
crist
with
a
two
fingered
head
this
is
my
first
vienna
lager
and
i
like
it
its
smell
is
sweet
and
hoppy
very
clean
it
is
chased
with
moderate
bitterness
this
mouthful
is
light
with
moderate
carbonation
overall
this
is
a
very
drinkable
beer
and
may
purchase
it
again
i
cant
recommend
this
pours
a
stale
looking
deep
amber
with
little
bubbles
and
a
small
head
that
lasts
for
only
two
sips
the
smell
is
of
bland
and
watery
sweet
malts
the
taste
is
a
btter
reflection
of
the
aroma
some
light
brown
sugar
and
toasted
mlats
with
a
hint
of
a
quick
roast
to
the
malt
at
the
end
a
little
dry
on
the
palate
but
still
a
little
cleansing
to
the
palate
bb

imo
missing
fullnesmaltsweetness
in
taste
also
and
also
poorly

watery

and

overall
nothing
much
of
interest
an
average
malty
lager
poured
from
a
classic
style
flip
top
bottle
into
a
rastal
pilsner
glass
beautiful
white
head
that
formed
2
fingers
at
the
top
of
the
glass
great
malty
nose
that
reminded
me
of
standing
in
the
middle
of
a
brewery
well
balanced
there
is
a
slight
hop
presence
but
not
hoppy
at
all
slightly
sweet
with
caramel
and
toffy
notes
golden
color
which
surprised
me
since
the
outside
of
the
bottle
says
one
of
a
kind
amber
beer
sensation
overall
very
refeshing
d
felt
a
little
sick
about
half
way
through
not
full
sick
just
wasnt
sitting
quite
right
quite
nice
drinkability
high
couldve
had
a
few
more
of
these
fellas
a
well
made
german
lager
pours
out
to
a
medium
golden
orange
color
with
a
nice
12
inch
head
of
fome
some
lace
medium
low
levels
of
carbonation
aromas
of
bread
and
dough
cross
the
nose
with
some
maltiness
and
grain
notes
even
a
touch
of
honey
nice
taste
is
straightforward
and
direct
no
hidden
or
overly
complex
flavors
here
folks
malts
wood
grain
husk
a
note
of
bread
and
dough
again
quite
nice
the
mouthfeel
is
uneventful
with
little
carbonation
making
it
to
the
tongue
a
step
above
water
otherwise
drinkability
is
ok
this
is
a
good
beer
but
i
cant
see
myself
drinking
it
in
quantity
worth
a
try
pours
a
golden
color
with
a
nice
head
from
a
half
liter
brown
swingtop
bottle
aroma
seems
a
little
fruity
the
taste
is
on
the
malty
side
there
seems
to
be
a
moment
of
metallic
taste
in
it
by
no
means
overpowering
though
i
like
this
beer
its
very
drinkable
worth
a
try
served
in
bottle
i
have
enjoyed
their
alt
before
and
thought
this
would
also
be
good
to
try
the
beer
poured
a
clear
golden
color
with
a
minimal
white
head
with
some
carbonation
the
smell
of
the
beer
is
a
pleasing
caramel
malty
aroma
with
some
citrus
notes
in
the
background
the
taste
is
a
good
balance
of
the
caramel
malts
that
i
noted
in
the
aroma
but
there
is
also
some
nutty
notes
in
the
taste
that
is
enjoyable
this
as
the
alt
from
schwelmer
are
easy
to
drink
and
give
you
a
nice
taste
that
lingers
for
a
bit
i
poured
this
beer
into
a
mug
from
a
500ml
swing
top
bottle
the
beer
pours
a
crystal
clear
ruddy
copper
color
with
a
1
inch
head
which
settles
down
to
a
12
inch
fine
layer
atop
the
beer
it
has
a
light
to
medium
malty
aroma
but
there
is
also
a
hint
of
spice
the
taste
is
of
bread
very
light
citrus
and
is
balanced
with
some
spiciness
the
mouthfeel
is
soft
and
clean
and
sits
very
light
in
the
mouth
this
was
a
very
easy
beer
to
drink
nice
drinkability
this
beer
is
a
nobrainer
nothing
outoftheordinary
going
on
but
quite
delicious
and
easy
to
drink
mouthfeel
is
full
and
smooth
very
nice
and
easy
drinking
vienna
would
be
one
of
my
more
favored
of
the
lager
varieties
and
this
was
an
enjoyable
example
500
ml
flip
top
bottle
schwelmer
bernstein
pours
out
a
clear
yellowish
brown
color
with
a
rapidly
diminishing
head
the
aroma
is
apples
a
little
caramel
and
floral
german
hops
grainy
malt
flavor
with
a
little
bit
of
apple
fruitiness
finishes
with
german
hops
and
a
bit
of
a
metallic
mineral
flavor
the
mouthfeel
is
not
very
crisp
but
its
creamy
decent
drinkability
this
is
a
fairly
good
beer
but
its
not
as
good
as
other
offerings
from
the
brewery
especially
the
alt
a
beer
i
would
happily
drink
again
but
as
the
style
is
not
my
favourite
not
one
i
would
seek
to
drink
a
lot
of
swing
top
bottle
purchased
at
whole
foods
in
middletown
new
jersey
as
a
rule
i
like
this
style
because
it
has
a
nice
sweet
malty
taste
without
being
cloying
or
heavy
this
brew
did
not
disappoint
it
was
a
superb
example
of
the
style
pours
a
nice
amber
brown
with
a
generous
white
head
that
was
not
too
shortlived
nor
was
it
long
lasting
left
lots
of
nice
lacing
and
had
a
sweet
caramel
malt
profile
with
a
nice
short
bitter
hoppy
finish
i
will
buy
this
one
again
an
ok
beer
but
not
a
beer
that
id
return
to
definatley
better
than
locally
brewed
macro
lagers
and
the
bottle
rocked
the
swingtop
bottle
is
cool
and
good
for
homebrewing
i
wish
more
breweries
would
do
this
clear
dark
gold
color
with
bronze
highlights
medium
fluffy
white
head
aroma
is
of
roasted
barley
doughy
bread
and
toasted
almonds
taste
is
lacking
the
flavor
intensity
i
want
palate
seems
a
little
thin
and
undercarbonated
smooth
but
the
flavors
just
dont
come
out
caramel
is
there
along
with
biscuit
and
some
light
floral
hops
in
the
finish
kind
of
forgetable
no
off
flavors
here
but
nothing
great
either
decent
and
drinkable
but
i
wouldnt
recommend
a
very
quick
drinker
not
that
bad
not
complicated
schwelmer
bernstein
sounds
like
the
name
of
a
concert
pianist
is
a
rather
hohum
version
of
the
style
in
my
opinion
the
lack
of
any
horrendous
missteps
means
that
its
drinkable
but
the
lack
of
any
bright
spots
whatsoever
means
that
its
also
forgettable
notes
goes
very
well
with
preseason
bruins
hockey
pours
a
nice
rich
light
copper
with
a
big
fluffy
white
well
retained
headaromas
of
lightly
sweet
pizza
dough
and
and
black
pepper
i
like
the
beginnings
of
this
brew
very
refreshing
and
quaffable
some
may
think
because
of
the
darker
color
this
lager
maybe
not
as
quaffable
but
they
would
be
wrong
here
taste
is
toasty
and
lightly
sweet
but
there
is
a
nice
herbalspicey
hoppiness
that
takes
over
adding
to
the
drinkability
and
keeping
it
balanced
i
personally
love
this
beer
and
this
style
of
beer
its
hard
to
find
and
this
one
is
a
gem
a
mellow
herbal
and
sweet
malt
body
blends
well
with
sharpedged
floral
hop
bite
minor
tastes
of
limes
vie
for
attention
this
is
a

easy

not

could
be
a

oktoberfest
or
vienna
lager
labeled
as
an
amber
for
the

market
dunno
nevertheless
a
tasty
brew
drinkability

this
is
a
good
lager
that
oozes
authenticity
the
flavors
were
a
little
off
but
the
terrific
mouthfeel
and
high
drinkability
of
this
effort
from
schwelm
is
a
winner
drinkability
notes
a
decent
amber
lager
more
of
a
quick
lunch
time
beer
as
i
would
probably
not
drink
more
than
one
i
like
this
one
alot
a
nice
clean
dark
golden
beer
with
a
big
off
white
fizzy
head
the
aroma
has
that
malt
sweetness
that
i
find
a
lot
of
marzen
style
beers
there
is
a
light
fruitiness
in
there
also
with
a
background
hint
of
spice
the
sweetness
is
not
as
assertive
as
again
most
of
this
style
that
i
have
had
but
the
hop
bitterness
creates
an
nice
dry
finish
the
taste
does
not
overwhelm
your
palate
which
would
make
it
a
good
beer
to
drink
many
of
nice
and
tasty
straight
out
of
the
swing
top
bottle
which
opened
with
a
pop
the
beer
was
dark
golden
the
pours
i
gave
david
and
myself
came
topped
with
a
12
of
thick
but
frothy
cream
colored
head
it
has
since
died
down
but
is
still
covering
my
glass
interesting
aroma
i
am
picking
up
some
earthiness
faint
breadyness
and
maybe
some
walk
in
an
apple
orchard
taste
is
pleasant
not
farreaching
in
any
particular
areas
but
concentrating
on
biscuity
malt
followed
by
some
sweetness
and
some
small
mouth
watering
bitterness
easy
to
drink
i
can
see
this
being
a
great
session
brew
the
beer
pours
a
dark
goldamber
color
with
a
thick
frothy
white
head
that
slowly
fades
to
lacing
the
aroma
is
good
it
has
a
dry
yet
creamy
malt
scent
that
boasts
of
pale
and
crystal
malts
it
is
a
bit
musty
and
fruity
on
the
finish
the
taste
is
good
it
has
a
crisp
and
dry
malty
flavor
that
goes
down
easy
and
finishes
slightly
bitter
the
hops
linger
in
the
aftertaste
very
nice
the
mouthfeel
is
decent
it
is
a
medium
bodied
beer
with
good
carbonation
this
is
a
good
drinking
german
octoberfest
it
has
excellent
flavor
and
aroma
a
good
drinker
this
is
schwelmers
newest
creation
and
i
would
say
it
is
an
instant
classic
i
only
tired
it
a
few
times
since
they
only
just
introduced
it
last
year
2002
but
this
ambercolored
beer
is
exceptionally
smooth
and
soft
very
pretty
new
fliptop
bottle
giving
it
the
look
of
a
turn
of
the
century
brew
very
thin
basically
a
viennadark
lager
very
light
malts
drinkable
but
just
far
too
thin
in
body
harsh
after
taste
enjoyed
this
beer
for
many
years
than
i
got
into
craft
no
longer
what
im
looking
for
disappointing
in
almost
every
way
this
is
not
a
bad
beer
but
its
not
nearly
good
enough
to
justify
the
price
id
rather
drink
miller
lite
nothing
special
would
rather
drink
a
corona
with
a
lime
decent
mexican
amber
lager
it
is
labeled
as
a
vienna
style
lager
but
it
seems
like
a
premium
adjunct
lager
imo
however
it
is
refreshing
alongside
ensenada
style
fish
tacos
pretty
good
drinking
beer
but
didnt
have
much
flavor
kinda
tasted
like
filtered
water
with
a
pinch
of
alcohol
mixed
in
draft
revisited
at
canyon
club
in
agoura
hills
wheaty
and
plain
but

this

this
beer
is
much
better
in

form
than
in
a
bottle
every
time
i
have
drank
it
aroma
has
a
bit
of
nutiness
flavor
is
very
malt
forward
but
tastes
a
bit
stale
and
has
cardboard
flavor
hints
of
nuts
make
it
tolerable
one
of
my
favorite
mexican
beers
that
i
can
get
right
at
the
local
mini
market
if
i
cant
find
bohemia
i
get
some
amber
lagers
good
summertime
beer
light
and
easy
to
go
down
dark
amber
pour
with
excellent
character
drinkability
better
then
any
other
beer
south
of
the
border
why
is
so
heavenly
good
on
draft
with
a
lime
and
some
chips
and
salsa
nice
refreshing
lager
nothing
special
but
great
at
a
mexican
restaurant
pretty
standard
weak
mexican
lager
you
wouldnt
drink
it
a
second
time
it
is
okay
on
draft
with
a
lime
much
better
than
corona
in
my
opinion
overall
very
pleasant
easy
drinking
pairs
terrifically
with
spicy
mexican
cuisine
had
at
mexican
pavilion
in
epcot
has
a
fake
malt
taste
to
it
very
weak
taste
for
a
mexican
beer
its
not
bad
thin
mighty
thin
tastes
like
macro
brew
aka
shit
not
a
big
surprise
considering
it
comes
out
of
mexico
the
best
in
my
opinion
in
the
line
up
of
dos
equis
tastes
a
bit
like
water
with
bread
in
it
cant
complain
too
much
a
decent
massproduced
beer
at
a
reasonable
price
and
there
are
far
worse
lagers
on
the
australian
market
than
this
nothing
special
and
its
a
bit
bland

most

dos

amber
is
best
on

with
a
lime
on
the
edge
of
the
glass
the
beer
is
not
great
but
it
definitely
passes
the
time
with
some
good
old
tex
mex
the
color
is
a
deep
copper
with
a
golden
hue
in
the
right
kind
of
light
the
head
is
rather
small
about
a
fingers
width
and
it
lingers
its
aroma
is
of
corn
not
overly
strong
it
tastes
of
grain
a
bit
watery
actually
it
has
a
dry
after
effect
not
bad
not
good
either
but
overall
this
is
a
beer
you
can
have
with
dinner
and
it
wont
ruin
your
evening
at
all
overall
this
is
not
a
terrible
beer
it
is
not
a
great
one
either
but
in
a
pinch
this
will
do

im
a
chatterbox
tonight
sorry
for
the
long
review
this
is
one
of
my
top
ambers
now
next
time
i
see
it
for
a
good
price
ill
pick
up
a
six
or
twelve
i
was
not
expecting
this
as
i
typically
dont
like
mexican
style
beers
but
this
one
somehow
rises
above
lovely
yeasty
bread
dough
with
a
slight
sour
malt
character
bravo
in
every
sense
of
the
word
overly
sweet
vienna
lager
not
that
bad
but
i
will
pass
next
time
overall
this
was
a
beer
had
in
desperation
we
had
flown
into
boston
on
an
evening
flight
for
a
friends
wedding
after
the
hour
long
drive
to
worcester
we
found
ourselves
with
a
hankering
for
some
sauce
at
about
11pm
it
was
a
friday
and
the
beginning
of
a
wedding
weekend
highly
understandable
we
drove
around
worcester
for
an
hour
looking
in
every
walgreens
cvs
and
sketchy
corner
store
we
could
find
looking
for
a
pack
of
local
beverages
to
bring
back
to
the
hotel
and
relax
with
alas
to
our
surprise
we
found
no
such
thing
frustrated
and
defeated
we
turned
back
towards
the
hotel
and
were
happy
to
find
an
alcoholslinging
establishment
a
mere
half
mile
from
our
temporary
abode
this
was
the
only
beer
available
aside
from
pacifico
so
we
really
just
flipped
a
coin
here
the
amber
lager
is
a
standard
mexican
adjunct
lager
giving
cheap
grain
through
the
nose
and
mouth
with
little
to
rest
upon
for
feel
or
sustenance
we
drank
the
swill
quickly
and
it
served
its
purpose
but
after
this
we
rapidly
moved
on
to
sampling
the
beverages
for
which
this
cantina
was
named
not
bad
dont
like
the
taste
at
the
end
overall
a
pretty
good
beer
i
definitely
choose
this
when
i
am
eating
mexican
food
remember
when
the
bottles
had
gold
foil
on
the
neck
the
beer
tasted
a
little
better
then
very
bubbly
o
very
disappointed
havent
had
one
these
in
a
few
years
and
for
some
reason
remembered
it
as
tasting
much
better
will
not
buy
again
o
ok
beer
would
rather
have
a
yuengling
but
not
bad
this
beer
was
okay
i
enjoyed
the
barley
that
was
in
it
and
i
enjoyed
the
malt
of
this
beer
i
liked
the
hops
that
this
beer
has
as
well
ir
was
not
too
heavy
at
all
and
for
a
fairly
cheap
beer
it
was
a
decent
beer
i
have
only
had
this
beer
in
a
bottle
i
would
like
to
try
it
on
tap
and
see
wich
one
taste
better
o
a
below
average
lager
tastes
very
underwhelming
as
expected
from
macro
its
watery
and
metallic
and
the
standard
lager
characteristics
are
so
downplayed
i
find
this
drinkable
because
well
it
is
easily
drinkable
with
its
underwhelming
tastes
but
nothing
really
here
to
note
one
of
my
favorite
lagers
and
much
better
than
the
special
lager
goes
down
easy
and
has
a
rich
taste
and
feel
to
it
very
refreshing
has
the
dark
brown
color
i
expect
from
a
lager
and
isnt
anything
fancy
or
expensive
its
a
decent
amber
lager
that
is
much
better
on
tap
then
out
of
the
bottle
you
can
expect
a
slight
metallic
taste
when
drinking
any
bottled
beer
but
it
is
even
more
so
prevolent
in
this
mexican
favorite
it
completely
takes
away
from
the
true
flavor
that
dos
equis
has
to
offer
overall
a
very
nice
beer
with
interesting
flavor
profile
that
leaves
a
pleasant
taste
good
bar
beer
to
have
with
bar
food
and
watch
a
game
and
goes
good
with
lime
wedge
overall
this
is
one
of
those
beers
where
i
just
dont
understand
the
appeal
its
not
bad
in
the
way
bad
beers
are
bad
meaning
its
not
funky
or
full
of
adjuncts
or
super
watereddown
but
its
also
thoroughly
eclipsed
by
so
many
other
options
sam
adams
flagship
is
the
same
style
probably
around
the
same
price
point
and
is
so
much
better
than
this
i
dont
always
drink
beer
but
when
i
do
prefer
it
to
taste
like
something
doc
equis
amber
lager
is
my
favorite
anytime
beer
i
buy
this
anytime
i
spend
more
that
a
minute
staring
into
a
beer
cooler
its
a
safe
bet
that
ill
enjoy
it
and
the
beer
will
complement
whatever
im
eating
its
much
better
in
flavor
than
sam
adams
in
my
opinion
less
expensive
and
more
pleasant
to
drink
i
think
its
quite
flavorful
and
has
a
pleasant
finish
that
sort
of
wafts
around
my
palate
gracias
oone
of
the
best
lagers
ive
ever
had
in
my
extremely
limited
tasting
experience
other
lagers
ive
had
didnt
have
the
flavor
this
one
did
o
seems
kind
of
like
a
hybrid
of
a
vienna
lager
and
an
american
adjunct
lager
certainly
not
one
of
my
favorite
brews
but
not
horrible
easy
to
drink
and
pairs
well
with
spicy
foods
i
would
actually
prefer
their
lager
because
it
is
even
less
bold
in
flavor
bad
flavor
this
is
actually
a
decent
beer
very
flavorful
and
refreshing
worlds
better
than
the
basic
dos
equis
lager
i
frequently
have
this
or
negra
modelo
at
mexican
or
texmex
restaurants
o
not
bad
but
not
great
goes
well
with
spicy
food
so
when
you
are
eating
a
wonderful
mexican
breakfast
avoid
the
pale
ales
stouts
and
ipas
and
get
a
xx
amber
lager
well
before
noon
yes
i
dont
always
drink
beer
before
noon
but
when
i
do
its
a
xx
amber
poured
from
a
bottle
into
a
schooner
glass
it
has
a
nice
light
amber
hue
with
a
very
small
white
head
that
dissipates
quickly
it
has
a
very
faint
sweet
smell
it
has
a
light
malty
taste
with
a
good
sweetness
to
it
it
has
a
smooth
mouth
feel
with
a
lightly
dry
finish
overall
it
is
an
ok
beer
o
decent
mexican
beerfinally
if
you
are
new
to
beer
snobeness
and
want
to
try
a
nice
amber
beer
this
is
the
one
not
michelob
amber
bock
oh
sorry
thats
for
another
review
although
a
somewhat
average
beer
i
find
the
dos
equis
amber
lager
to
be
a
very
refreshing
and
smooth
beer
it
has
a
good
amount
of
taste
and
is
not
as
watery
as
many
beers
of
similar
pricing
i
find
this
beer
to
be
the
best
of
the
beers
that
one
can
get
a
pint
of
for
34
though
it
wont
overwhelm
you
with
complicated
tastes
and
smells
it
will
refresh
you
and
satisfy
you
goes
well
with
a
lime
garnish
and
makes
a
hot
summer
day
that
much
more
pleasant
o
good
beer
for
mexican
food
or
hot
summer
day
pours
a
clear
amber
with
about
a
12finger
off
white
head
that
settles
down
to
just
along
the
sides
of
the
top
of
the
brew
and
sides
some
very
spotty
lacing
is
seen
very
light
aroma
of
malts
and
caramel
the
taste
is
the
same
with
more
malts
coming
through
a
little
watereddown
but
decent
overall
smooth
to
drink
with
just
a
little
bitterness
for
the
finish
overall
a
decent
brew
o
this
is
an
overall
refreshing
mexican
beer
good
with
spicy
food
and
good
after
cutting
the
grass
if
it
happens
to
be
around
ill
never
turn
one
down
o
overall
i
was
pleasantly
surprised
with
this
beer
im
more
of
an
ale
drinker
myself
so
when
i
go
to
mexican
restaurants
im
always
slightly
depressed
when
i
cant
order
a
good
ipa
to
go
with
my
meal
this
one
definitely
lifted
my
spirits
and
will
probably
be
my
new
favorite
when
it
comes
to
latina
brews
all
in
all
unless
you
must
try
dont
bet
on
this
beer
its
over
priced
thin
and
frankly
disappointing
it
is
what
it
is
decent
when
paired
with
food
but
not
great
on
its
own
i
dont
always
drink
beer
but
when
i
do
its
probably
not
going
to
be
dos
equis
o
this
is
decent
for
what
it
is
when
youre
at
a
mexican
restaurant
eating
spicy
food
you
could
do
far
worse
than
to
order
this
beer
i
think
it
would
do
better
with
food
than
when
drank
on
its
own
as
im
doing
now
great
session
beer
very
smooth
with
a
really
good
taste
could
drink
like
7
of
these
in
1
session
very
easy
to
drink
beer
and
very
tasty
overall
pretty
good
beer
and
i
really
enjoyed
it
bottle
is
better
then
draft
i
was
very
impressed
about
how
great
it
went
down
and
like
it
a
great
deal
more
than
the
regular
dos
equis
o
solid
brew
to
have
on
a
hot
summer
day
with
a
slice
of
lime
this
is
one
of
my
go
to
session
brews
in
the
summer
straw
colored
pours
out
into
a
white
frothy
head
that
quickly
dissipates
into
minimal
lacing
slight
malty
smell
with
hints
of
bubble
gum
and
salt
water
taffy
a
little
malty
in
the
front
with
a
slight
hop
finish
light
to
medium
body
i
like
to
drink
this
with
mexican
cuisine
barely
touch
this
otherwise
its
a
good
beer
overall
i
rate
the
beer
higher
than
average
and
with
the
disclaimer
that
it
has
been
one
of
my
favorites
for
years
now
again
i
will
say
that
without
exception
it
is
vastly
better
south
of
the
border
due
to
the
obvious
freshness
of
being
a

beer
if
youre
gonna
drink
please
dont
drive
and
if
you
drive
for
cryin
out
loud
do
us
all
a
favor
and
dont
drink
stay
safe
im
not
sure
that
ive
had
another
of
this
particular
style
but
ive
been
drinking
these
occasionally
for
a
long
time
they
definitely
go
good
with
mexican
cuisine
and
also
make
a
good
session
brew
overall
i
like
the
sweet
taste
in
the
beginning
but
the
after
taste
was
kind
of
weak
with
the
smell
the
beer
is
clear
and
amber
with
a
small
white
head
weak
aroma
whats
there
is
adjuncts
grain
lager
type
scents
pretty
clean
flavor
initially
with
a
bit
of
corn
and
grain
harshness
in
the
finish
when
paired
with
saucy
and
spicy
food
this
flaw
is
disguised
to
some
degree
a
tad
sweet
with
some
fruity
malt
ok
overall
a
bit
nutty
and
adds
to
its
complexity
as
the
drink
finishes
not
the
mouth
rinse
its
xx
brother
is
but
not
much
else
going
on
beyond
its
extended
body
overall
if
i
had
a
regular
dos
equis
available
to
taste
along
with
it
im
sure
they
would
be
different
but
this
one
just
has
that
light
beer
flavor
with
maybe
a
little
bit
extra
but
ill
continue
to
order
this
with
mexican
when
its
available
light
sweet
malt
flavor
with
a
touch
of
airy
bready
dryness
the
carbonation
adds
to
an
easy
crisp
feel
but
detracts
from
any
real
taste
experience
overall
this
is
better
than
the
other
mexican
beer
options
but
still
not
great
if
its
your
only
choice
at
a
mexican
restaurant
go
for
it
i
am
rating
it
as
high
as
i
am
because
for
some
reason
i
never
tire
of
asking
for
a
dea
and
i
cant
wait
to
have
a
frosted
mug
of
it
placed
in
front
of
me
with
chips
and
salsa
o
better
than
i
was
expecting
light
and
easy
perfect
for
a
summer
day
had
a
few
bottles
of
this
watching
football
at
a
friends
this
weekend
its
an
easy
drinker
slightly
sweeter
than
id
like
but
its
got
more
taste
in
the
malty
range
than
the
domestic
chuggers
decent
aftertaste
too
when
in
the
land
of
mexican
macrobrews
this
is
my
goto
ive
not
had
it
with
a
lime
that
i
can
recall
but
that
might
give
it
a
nice
acidic
balance
i
prefer
negro
modelo
to
be
served
with
one
also
i
agree
with
others
that
this
is
best
when
ice
cold
gets
skunky
when
it
warms
overall
not
bad
at
all
i
had
this
a
few
years
ago
and
picked
up
on
a
variety
pack
and
absolutely
no
regrets
doesnt
hurt
to
have
a
light
beer
every
now
and
then
salud
dos
equis
was
crafted
in
mexico
in
1897
by
a
german
brew
master
who
deluded
his
brewing
heritage
with
the
spirit
of
mexican
traditions
originally
called
siglo
xx
to
celebrate
the
arrival
of
the
20th
century
it
later
became
known
as
just
dos
equis
or
simple
two
xs
in
spanish
dos
equis
amber
is
a
full
flavored
yet
surprisingly
smooth
ambercolored
lager
from
mexio
that
is
easy
to
drink
with
a
clean
finish
overall
not
a
bad
beer
at
all
good
for
hot
days
when
you
wanna
drink
a
six
pack
o
one
of
the
better
mexican
beers
i
sometimes
enjoy
with
salt
and
lime
overall
a
good
quality
easydrinking
amber
that
went
very
very
well
alongside
the
steak
at
the
spanish
club
a
good
beer
for
au43
a
case
definitely
a
goer
overall
ah
it
ok
quite
easy
to
drink
and
a
moderate
amount
of
flavor
quite
nonoffensive
perhaps
the
best
lager
from
mexico
it
has
a
nice
brown
color
and
is
good
with
or
without
food
the
mild
flavor
has
bready
caramel
notes
sharkeristic
if
the
style
overall
decent
beer
refreshing
and
flavorful
i
would
have
it
again
overall
no
real
high
expectations
coming
in
its
worth
a
try
one
time
but
i
dont
think
i
would
buy
it
unless
i
was
eating
mexican
food
with
a
bunch
of
friends
or
something
best
served
ice
cold
it
would
be
ok
with
some
fajitas
that
you
would
be
grilling
out
nothing
i
would
go
to
a
bar
and
order
pours
a
dark
ruby
brown
with
about
1cm
of
creamy
head
that
fades
away
some
but
hangs
onto
the
glass
around
the
edges
smells
yeasty
mildly
fruity
and
a
little
spicy
tastes
very
mild
very
watery
no
hop
flavor
or
bitterness
to
speak
of
mouthfeel
is
creamy
and
a
little
fizzy
not
too
bad
but
not
too
good
either
overall
its
fairly
bland
i
guess
i
should
have
expected
that
from
a
macro
pours
a
ruddy
copper
body
with
a
slight
short
lasting
head
head
disolves
into
a
thin
film
with
slightly
spotty
lacing
unusual
aroma
which
i
realy
couldnt
identify
but
my
wife
describes
as
feet
the
surprise
is
in
the
taste
its
crisp
and
slightly
sweet
at
first
barest
hint
of
hops
aftertaste
is
a
tad
sour
loses
flavor
and
appeal
as
it
warms
would
not
drink
again
certainly
wasnt
a
well
crafted
beer
reminded
me
of
some
dry
beers
i
see
why
a
lot
of
mexican
beers
are
served
with
limes
in
them
because
this
flavorless
dry
beer
needed
something
to
add
a
little
life
to
it
o
i
didnt
have
much
for
expectations
so
i
cant
say
i
was
overly
disappointed
a
touch
more
flavorful
than
their
lager
but
certainly
nothing
memorable
here
overall
this
beer
seems
to
get
progressively
worse
as
the
years
wear
on
i
remember
i
used
to
love
this
one
now
not
so
much
it
tastes
like
metal
and
wet
cardboard
maybe
i
need
to
drink
it
from
the
bottle
with
a
lime
dunno
on
tap
in
a
mug
pours
deep
copper
color
with
fizzy
head
that
dissipates
quickly
the
nose
is
unimpressive
some
whole
grain
bread
and
caramel
the
taste
is
slightly
metallic
with
caramel
sweetness
and
the
palate
is
pure
water
i
drink
this
with
mexican
food
overall
just
average
straight
out
of
a
beers
of
mexico
pack
smelled
as
most
amber
lagers
do
cant
speak
for
a
appearance
since
it
was
in
a
bottle
this
beer
is
quite
tasty
with
the
taste
outperforming
the
original
dos
equis
mouthfeel
was
pretty
great
though
you
could
taste
the
alcohol
but
it
must
be
had
ice
cold
for
it
to
be
as
good
as
mine
was
my
buddy
had
one
that
was
piss
warm
and
it
tasted
like
horrid
jose
cuervo
o
well
not
much
to
say
its
nothing
to
scream
about
id
probably
have
it
again
preferably
on
tap
better
than
many
macros
i
have
tried
easy
to
drink
and
nothing
really
offensive
about
it
still
the
lack
of
flavor
depth
and
complexity
shows
why
craft
beers
have
become
so
popular
pours
a
clear
light
amber
with
a
foamy
orangewhite
head
that
settles
to
a
film
on
top
of
the
beer
foamy
streaks
of
lace
form
around
the
glass
on
the
drink
down
smell
is
of
grain
slight
caramel
and
some
metallic
aromas
taste
is
pretty
much
the
same
there
is
a
mild
bitterness
on
the
palate
with
each
sip
this
beer
has
a
lower
level
of
carbonation
with
a
slightly
crisp
mouthfeel
overall
this
is
a
pretty
average
beer
but
at
least
its
pretty
drinkable
for
what
it
is
supposedly
one
of
the
better
mexican
exports
but
i
did
not
care
for
this
smells
like
an
adjunct
lager
with
a
touch
of
sweeter
malt
kind
of
offputting
in
an
extracty
way
flavor
is
the
same
very
corn
lagery
artificially
sweet
feel
is
really
weird
for
a
beer
expansive
like
a
shaken
up
soda
overly
bubbly
and
funny
in
the
stomach
body
is
less
than
medium
and
its
actually
really
drinkable
aside
from
the
way
it
made
me
feel
i
think
its
also
much
less
refresing
than
the
regular
dos
equis
lager
which
i
dont
mind
too
much
this
one
is
all
up
a
pretty
nasty
beer
but
still
preferable
to
corona
by
a
long
shot
overall
i
picked
this
one
over
the
regular
lager
since
it
had
a
brown
bottle
and
damn
it
if
they
are
right
i
got
a
non
skunked
beer
if
only
it
was
cheaper
i
would
have
it
as
a
regular
in
my
fridge
onot
the
worlds
most
interesting
beer
officially
wont
seek
out
again
except
on
cinco
de
mayo
id
have
again
if
this
was
the
only
quality
choice
oas
far
as
the
mini
tour
goes
this
was
probably
the
best
of
the
bunch
but
when
they
have
to
slice
a
lime
for
every
one
of
the
beers
on
the
tour
its
not
good
especially
when
they
ruin
the
only
decent
one
with
a
lime
which
is
why
i
dont
usually
review
my
old
chicago
beers
but
this
cinco
tour
was
just
not
that
good
amber
body
with
a
short
off
white
head
smell
is
faintly
malty
toast
caramel
taste
similarly
has
toasted
elements
malt
mild
sweetness
and
enough
floral
hop
to
keep
the
palate
clean
mouthfeel
mediumlight
with
good
carbonation
one
of
the
better
mexican
mass
beers
decent
beer
not
great
thin
bodied
on
the
palate
i
guess
is
the
rule
for
mexican
beers
and
light
carbonation
this
is
the
best
dos
equis
that
i
have
tried
so
far
i
like
the
golden
amber
body
of
the
beer
the
crisp
clean
taste
not
chemical
after
taste
the
grains
come
through
in
the
flavor
it
is
one
that
is
an
enjoyable
drink
with
a
meal
or
just
while
watching
tv
i
will
be
enjoying
this
beer
during
my
off
time
this
summer
light
copper
color
with
a
good
head
its
hard
to
judge
a
lace
as
it
was
served
quite
cold
not
much
of
an
aroma
but
at
least
not
offensive
a
nice
hops
taste
when
compared
to
other
mexican
beers
of
this
style
light
taste
but
indicative
of
style
i
would
order
this
over
corona
any
day
pours
a
clear
amber
color
with
no
head
or
lace
its
aroma
is
caramel
and
bread
crust
the
flavor
is
sweet
malt
with
no
hop
bite
and
a
hint
of
caramel
bland
the
mouthfeel
is
thin
dos
equis
amber
lager
is
just
a
regular
beer
nothing
special
not
recommended
o
definitely
better
than
the
regular
dos
equis
with
the
same
smooth
character
but
a
little
more
flavor
and
body
its
a
a
step
above
the
clone
upon
clones
that
are
out
there
but
not
a
gamechanger
o
the
beer
certainly
looks
like
a
vienna
lager
but
does
not
really
smell
like
one
having
more
of
a
resemblance
to
that
of
an
adjunct
lager
o
fantastic
amber
when
youre
eating
mexican
food
and
youre
at
a
good
restaurant
that
has
it
fresh
on
tap
but
its
not
nearly
as
good
from
a
bottle
it
seems
o
drinkable
but
really
not
anything
to
spend
money
on
there
are
plenty
of
other
inexpensive
offerings
that
taste
better
than
this
one
sam
adams
anyone
body
seems
watery
not
a
bad
mexican
beer
overall
a
little
on
the
watery
side
but
i
love
the
flavor
m
mouthfeel
is
average
lightly
toasted
lightly
creamy
in
flavor
with
a
decent
fine
carbonation
bit
of
caramel
sweetness
and
finishing
with
a
hint
of
drying
bitterness
slightly
nutty
after
some
agitation
but
otherwise
a
bit
thin
in
the
end
clean
yet
subtle
across
the
board
a
good
warm
weather
brew
and
more
of
a
dunkel
given
the
malt
structure
poured
this
vienna
lager
from
a
12
oz
bottle
into
a
pint
glass
this
brew
poured
a
light
brown
to
copper
color
and
produced
a
off
white
head
decent
retention
and
nice
lacing
left
on
the
glass
the
aroma
of
this
brew
consists
of
toasted
malt
and
some
trace
amount
of
hops
light
in
body
this
brew
has
the
taste
of
sweet
toasted
grain
semi
dry
feel
some
earthy
hop
bitterness
one
of
my
favorite
mexican
lagers
sure
beats
the
heck
out
of
corona
prost
the
taste
had
hints
of
caramel
and
roasted
malt
with
a
slightly
grassy
hop
flavor
not
bad
but
not
spectacular
either
one
of
the
better
mexican
beers
but
thats
not
saying
much
usually
my
goto
with
mexican
food
overall
again
just
an
awful
example
of
what
a
beer
could
be
this
isnt
the
best
vienna
lager
out
there
but
i
think
its
probably
the
best
beer
ive
had
from
this
particular
brewery
again
better
than
most
macro
offerings
i
was
pleasantly
surprised
after
not
drinking
this
beer
in
years
pretty
good
for
macro
craft
is
now
my
first
love
but
sometimes
dos
e
hits
the
spot
overall
who
doesnt
enjoy
pounding
32oz
mugs
of
this
with
your
friends
at
a
mexican
restaurant
is
it
a
great
beer
no
but
i
can
honestly
say
every
time
i
drink
this
beer
i
feel
happy
i
have
also
had
a
bottle
of
this
served
ice
cold
this
mutes
the
flavours
and
produces
a
very
lame
cgrade
vienna
lager
this
is
one
that
definitely
benefits
from
ten
minutes
on
the
counter
before
being
poured
regardless
of
the
serving
temperature
though
you
can
be
assured
that
this
is
a
much
tastier
beer
than
the
majority
of
its
mexican
lager
counterparts
this
is
often
the
optimal
choice
at
mexican
restaurants
and
its
a
respectable
session
beer
if
nothing
else
i
would
not
be
opposed
to
drinking
this
again
but
its
not
something
id
ever
get
regularly
o
a
decent
brew
certainly
better
than
the
adjunctmacro
lagers
out
there
i
would
certainly
choose
this
over
corona
it
has
the
look
of
an
amber
ale
to
it
taste
is
equally
as
inoffensive
slightly
malty
with
very
little
hops
mouthfeel
and
a
dry
finish
good
on
a
hot
day
and
refreshing
with
mexican
food
but
thats
the
range
of
this
beer
o
ive
had
this
beer
every
time
i
go
to
a
mexican
restaurant
but
this
is
the
first
time
ive
actually
taken
the
time
to
review
it
it
is
a
decent
mexican
beer
but
nothing
great
finisha
little
bit
of
chocolate
spice
and
hops
this
beer
is
not
good
at
all
especially
for
the
price
though
not
bad
it
doesnt
really
seem
to
have
a
place
body
of
a
summer
beer
taste
that
doesnt
match
overall
its
lasting
qualities
in
the
glass
are
poor
as
well
overall
this
beer
is
ok
well
i
certainly
prefer
this
to
the
special
lager
i
think
this
has
a
bit
more
character
and
the
sweet
malts
do
accompany
the
food
quite
well
on
its
own
its
not
the
worst
beer
in
the
world
to
drink
however
i
probably
will
only
consume
these
at
mexican
restaurants
it
just
puts
me
in
the
mood
serving
type
ontap
overall
this
is
a
pretty
good
brew
always
my
choice
at
the
mexican
restaurants
and
much
better
than
any
of
the
other
mass
produced
beers
out
there
i
had
a
bad
experience
before
last
time
i
had
it
it
was
served
with
a
lime
in
it
and
it
was
terrible
keep
your
damn
limes
out
of
vienna
lagers
please
and
thank
you
well
the
color
is
nice
a
medium
amber
smell
is
ok
just
a
beery
whiff
faint
taste
of
caramel
no
thats
imagination
from
the
color
bitterness
is
the
soapy
dishwater
style
i
didnt
realize
this
stuff
was
so
bad
its
just
a
flat
dull
flavor
with
an
unpleasant
cardboard
sort
of
taste
faintly
woody
not
crisp
enough
for
a
decent
gulp
o
this
was
really
gross
tasting
if
this
is
supposed
to
be
the
same
style
as
boston
lager
then
the
differences
are
night
and
day
this
beer
is
not
bad
the
colorisa
very
nice
rich
brown
crystal
clear
the
smell
is
nothing
special
about
average
the
taste
is
better
than
a
usual
lager
more
malty
there
is
a
nice
flavor
here
nothing
exceptional
just
slightly
above
average
i
think
this
beer
is
pretty
sollid
i
like
it
better
on
draft
with
some
nachos
on
the
side
thats
how
i
usually
take
it
not
sure
if
this
story
amounts
to
a
compliment
or
an
insult
but
it
is
all
true
had
a
12
oz
bottle
of
dos
equis
amber
with
my
dinner
at
home
tonight
it
is
a
good
overall
beer
that
goes
almost
with
anything
but
is
especially
suited
for
mexican
food
i
think
dos
equis
amber
is
the
best
of
the
mexican
beers
it
is
better
on
tap
and
the
only
mexican
beer
that
does
not
require
a
lime
to
enhance
the
taste
like
the
commercial
says
i
dont
often
drink
mexican
beer
but
when
i
do
i
prefer
dos
equis
o
nice
easy
drinking
lager
that
pairs
well
with
mexican
food
not
anything
outstanding
but
nothing
offensive
either
a
nice
enjoyable
brew
overall
this
is
a
nice
amber
nothing
special
but
very
drinkable
overall
this
isnt
a
bad
beer
id
consider
this
over
other
generic
lagers
on
a
hot
day
o
a
pretty
solid
beer
the
most
interesting
man
in
the
world
should
advertise
their
amber
instead
of
their
lager
at
least
as
much
in
common
with
an
american
adjunct
lager
as
a
true
vienna
lager
which
is
a
shame
but
one
of
the
better
bigname
pasteurized
beers
available
overall
this
is
not
a
bad
beer
when
you
consider
the
mexican
beer
market
but
if
im
to
compare
it
to
other
vienna
lagers
this
beer
is
mediocre
at
best
poured
a
dark
caramelamber
color
smelled
of
malts
grains
and
hops
the
taste
was
sweet
and
heavily
dominated
by
a
malt
and
caramel
flavor
very
light
on
the
tongue
and
not
much
complexity
finishes
crisp
and
slightly
bitter
but
has
a
nice
aftertaste
not
bad
but
not
outstanding
either
vienna
lagers
should
offer
more
than
this
but
so
few
are
available
on
the
market
this
is
one
of
the
few
examples
most
people
have
had
thats
a
shame
this
may
be
on
of
the
better
mexican
beer
available
but
that
sets
the
bar
pretty
low
o
surprised
by
this
beer
it
was
better
then
i
thought
though
i
may
be
effected
by
the
atmosphere
around
solid
and
much
better
then
bmcs
well
worth
a
try
i
have
to
cop
to
being
impressed
by
the
fingerandahalf
of
thick
deeptan
head
with
decent
retention
off
of
my
pour
color
was
a
gorgeous
copperyamber
with
nequality
clarity
bupgoo
nose
had
a
caramel
sweetness
very
nice
and
very
unexpected
mouthfeel
was
medium
with
a
mildly
malty
sweetness
on
the
tongue
finish
was
semidry
and
quite
drinkable
plus
the
lacing
it
left
behind
was
also
notable
now
i
am
doubly
interested
in
trying
it
from
a
can
this
was
good
not
great
but
still
overall
this
beer
strikes
me
as
a
step
between
budlight
and
bud
i
have
alot
of
respect
for
this
style
but
justice
is
not
done
here
m
o
mouthfeel
is
crisp
clean
and
smooth
with
a
slightly
creamy
taste
overall
a
decent
beer
that
goes
nicely
with
mexican
food
and
is
much
tastier
on
tap
than
in
the
bottle
overall
for
this
category
you
could
do
a
lot
worse
i
would
certainly
pick
this
over
many
of
the
other
massproduced
beers
that
are
similar
in
style
d
overall
not
the
best
or
worst
vienna
ive
ever
had
just
wish
there
was
slightly
more
noble
hop
presence
t
not
sure
what
this
beer
is
trying
to
be
as
it
wouldnt
quench
a
thirst
an
enjoyable
mexican
brew
with
a
bit
more
flavor
than
a
lot
of
what
is
out
there
the
taste
is
mostly
a
combination
of
the
above
a
light
bodied
mass
production
type
beer
it
was
very
drinkable
and
would
serve
the
purpose
in
hot
climates
o
not
a
bad
pairing
with
mexican
food
the
beer
serves
its
purpose
but
it
lacks
a
bit
in
the
flavor
department
looks
like
a
typical
vienna
malt
except
for
no
head
at
all
coppery
colored
and
translucent
smell
however
is
terribly
thin
compared
to
many
other
similar
offerings
sure
its
refreshing
with
your
food
but
thats
because
there
seems
to
be
so
much
water
in
there
taste
is
similarly
bland
and
watered
down
it
does
have
one
thing
in
its
favor
and
that
is
the
lack
of
typical
adjunct
lager
off
flavors
which
i
understand
to
be
common
for
mexican
beers
i
cant
really
detect
any
flavorful
chords
of
any
significance
however
easily
forgettable
but
not
terrible
or
disgusting
to
taste
this
beer
pours
out
as
a
relatively
decent
amber
color
with
not
a
lot
of
head
or
lacing
the
smell
is
rather
generic
its
grainy
and
mostly
a
nose
full
of
malts
the
taste
has
some
hop
bitterness
to
it
but
nothing
too
special
the
mouthfeel
is
a
little
watery
to
me
overall
i
wont
need
to
have
this
one
again
i
dont
think
overall
its
been
a
while
since
i
last
had
a
dos
equis
and
im
afraid
my
tastes
have
just
changed
either
that
or
this
beer
is
trying
too
hard
not
to
offend
anyones
sensibilities
d
simple
lager
but
not
much
else
dont
really
care
for
it
this
is
my
favorite
beer
from
south
of
the
border
overall
if
you
want
a
beer
to
wash
down
those
enchiladas
and
tastes
better
than
corona
go
for
this
if
youre
looking
for
a
genuinetasting
vienna
lager
stay
far
far
away
not
bad
for
what
it
is
but
probably
not
worth
pursuing
outside
of
this
kind
of
context
in
comparison
to
its
grupo
modelo
counterparts
this
cervecería
moctezuma
viennastyle
offering
is
much
more
acceptable
and
closer
to
the
mark
of
an
authentic
european
amber
lager
its
also
a
far
more
drinkable
beer
in
my
opinion
than
the
standard
dos
equis
lager
its
still
no
substitute
for
the
german
or
american
examples
but
it
at
least
provides
a
little
actual
diversity
and
quality
to
the
otherwise
shoddy
mexican
portfolio
not
the
most
flavorful
beer
around
but
smooth
and
easy
to
drink
good
to
chug
down
on
a
hot
day
or
when
eating
spicy
mexican
food
if
youre
going
to
try
it
get
a
6
pack
when
its
30c
out
and
enjoy
overall
drinkability
well
with
mexican
food
this
beer
does
quite
well
from
what
i
remember
in
the
past
the
many
times
ive
had
it
it
does
a
great
job
quenching
spicy
heat
without
drowning
the
flavor
by
itself
though
after
mowing
the
yard
im
not
as
enthusiastic
about
it
i
fear
i
let
general
zaragoza
down
with
this
one
ill
have
to
try
something
better
next
year
will
not
have
again
o
by
no
means
is
this
a
go
to
beer
of
mine
but
a
quality
choice
much
better
than
the
reputation
it
usually
gets
imho
stay
thirsty
my
friends
at
my
watering
hole
again
for
the
mini
tour
a
bit
of
a
redamber
color
with
no
aroma
again
and
very
little
head
taste
was
actually
not
too
bad
the
sweet
malt
that
seems
so
prevalant
in
mexican
brews
is
more
laid
back
i
wont
go
out
of
my
way
to
buy
this
but
at
a
mexican
resturaunt
with
littleno
choice
id
do
this
one
especially
on
tap
this
is
just
my
personal
opinion
but
this
beer
isnt
that
good
although
darker
than
its
lager
counterpart
it
pales
in
comparison
ha
ha
not
the
greattasting
highly
carbonated
beer
from
mexico
ive
come
to
enjoy
green
bottle
dos
equis
this
one
is
a
whole
other
animal
and
the
taste
is
pretty
awful
it
tastes
like
it
has
more
alcohol
than
it
does
which
bothers
me
on
this
one
d
medium
light
mouthfeel
and
smooth
pours
a
dark
amber
color
with
a
short
lived
head
of
foam
has
a
rather
weak
scent
that
makes
it
really
hard
to
pick
anything
out
for
the
taste
you
can
pick
out
some
wheat
and
malts
but
thats
about
it
very
simple
taste
and
nothing
special
here
but
its
probably
of
the
better
mainstream
mexican
beers
the
beer
is
served
on
tap
in
a
giant
mug
hazy
and
lots
of
bubbles
it
is
an
amber
color
with
a
thick
frothy
offwhite
head
toasted
oats
and
semisweet
caramel
smells
the
beer
is
a
decent
tasting
lager
and
is
my
go
to
beer
at
mexican
joints
toasty
and
light
flavors
on
a
sharp
crisp
body
very
easy
to
drink
and
does
not
interfere
with
your
food
no
matter
what
you
are
eating
decent
beer
for
what
it
is
o
a
better
beer
than
i
expected
and
while
i
would
not
buy
a
sixer
of
it
and
bring
it
home
i
would
buy
it
if
out
if
limited
to
mexican
beers
drink
probably
one
of
the
better
beers
available
from
mexico
its
not
offensive
and
its
highly
drinkable
i
wouldnt
purchase
it
again
but
i
wouldnt
turn
one
away
if
offered
overall
see
drinkability
decent
with
chipotle
though
o
i
really
enjoy
this
style
and
dos
equis
amber
is
an
honest
effort
from
a
macro
not
in
the
same
conversation
as
a
sam
adams
but
this
is
probably
among
the
best
choices
at
your
local
mexican
restaurant
interesting
style
but
not
the
best
lager
ever
the
biggest
fault
is
the
weak
flavour
its
watery
and
lacks
depth
i
imagine
that
there
are
better
examples
out
there
drinkable
if
you
dont
want
your
tastebuds
challenged
in
any
way
this
one
reminds
me
of
a
cheap
newcastle
definitely
watered
down
compared
to
it
but
sort
of
your
average
nonlight
beer
probably
would
not
order
this
one
again
as
i
am
not
a
fan
of
dos
equis
d
very
drinkable
buy
one
and
try
it
for
your
self
d
this
is
a
fairly
drinkable
beer
a
lot
of
mexican
restaurants
dont
give
you
much
choice
of
beer
and
i
prefer
this
over
most
of
the
others
that
said
im
not
a
big
fan
ill
buy
it
again
in
a
restaurant
if
theres
nothing
better
to
choose
from
but
i
wont
be
keeping
it
in
the
fridge
the
body
was
a
bit
thin
very
the
style
but
still
decent
drinkability
was
good
but
this
beer
isnt
anything
special
so
why
bother
try
it
or
dont
it
doesnt
really
matter
poured
a
pretty
sexy
onefinger
offwhite
head
unlike
the
original
dos
equis
the
one
has
a
good
smell
to
it
moderate
banana
bread
character
had
to
stick
my
nose
close
in
there
to
smell
it
though
hints
of
toffee
taste
is
a
bit
like
coffee
maybe
a
little
bit
of
herb
or
dark
tea
mouthfeel
is
a
bit
spicey
and
goes
down
smooth
the
aroma
is
watery
and
slightly
like
caramel
and
paper
the
appearance
is
light
amber
with
a
small
head
the
taste
is
slightly
sweet
with
a
chemical
bitterness
that
is
horrible
the
palate
is
average
the
beer
is
not
good
overall
and
i
think
its
a
drain
pour
try
it
wiht
enchiladas
or
fajitas
drinks
about
average
but
maybe
slightly
above
final
thoughts
all
it
all
probably
one
of
the
better
mexican
beers
out
there
and
worlds
better
then
their
lager
this
was
interesting
and
i
was
happy
to
drink
it
and
would
gladly
have
it
again
as
a
side
note
i
can
also
see
this
being
a
beer
you
could
sell
your
nonba
buddies
on
too
d
good
however
there
is
nothing
that
differentiate
this
beer
from
others
of
the
style
solid
amber
colour
soso
foam
up
that
vanished
no
effervecence
smell
is
pretty
harsh
whn
cold
nasty
corn
and
crap
hops
but
when
it
warms
it
well
i
guess
it
doesnt
get
any
better
really
still
sweet
taste
is
ok
with
some
tasty
weak
malts
that
come
across
sort
of
dry
but
the
corn
alcohol
and
whatever
else
kills
any
real
enjoyment
here
the
brew
comes
across
a
bit
watery
fizzy
and
with
some
noticable
alcohol
weak
realistically
it
feels
lilke
i
have
foam
in
my
mouth
empty
finish
final
thoughl
vienna
lager
not
quite
color
is
the
only
thing
this
beer
has
in
common
with
a
vienna
lager
not
hoppy
enough
not
crisp
enough
d
a
solid
beer
i
could
session
this
with
no
problems
and
i
can
find
no
faults
in
the
beer
i
am
kinda
impressed
as
i
was
expecting
something
horrible
if
it
didnt
look
so
pretty
in
a
glass
i
wouldnt
of
even
tried
d
drinks
ok
for
a
mexican
beer
but
i
prefer
corona
over
this
not
the
best
amber
if
you
ask
me
d
good
to
drink
easy
and
satisfying
once
again
i
find
myself
having
stayed
thirsty
throughout
the
better
part
of
the
day
after
summitting
my
second
mountain
in
as
many
days
photographing
a
very
rare
predatory
mountain
goat
i
arrived
at
the
buddhist
temple
in
search
of
enlightenment
instead
they
handed
me
this
fine
chilled
bottle
of
mexican
lager
and
a
fine
tumbler
my
thirst
was
modest
and
started
becoming
quenched
with
the
fine
tawny
juice
a
very
nice
balance
of
noble
hop
and
toasted
malt
slight
metallic
flavor
and
finishing
a
tad
sweet
overall
it
was
a
delight
a
finely
crafted
large
production
entity
its
a
dark
colored
lager
smells
of
freshly
yeasted
sour
dough
the
taste
is
very
mild
and
nondescript
it
has
a
slightly
sour
bite
but
not
very
much
flavor
it
is
watery
and
unoffensive
just
something
neutral
to
drink
while
you
are
having
dinner
or
doing
whatever
you
like
to
do
it
strikes
a
nice
balance
in
my
belly
with
some
fresh
tortilla
chips
and
salsa
fresca
had
this
beer
at
home
in
a
bottle
it
wasnt
terrible
however
it
wasnt
great
for
me
it
was
just
an
average
beer
for
its
style
it
was
a
bit
better
than
what
i
have
had
drinkability
is
good
you
could
do
worse
i
could
drink
a
6
pack
on
a
warm
summer
day
and
be
content
i
would
be
disappointed
if
this
had
been
an
american
amber
beer
nothing
out
of
the
ordinary
part
of
a
variety
pack
of
3
different
dos
equis
beers
sad
to
say
it
just
does
not
live
up
to
the
mystique
of
mexico
go
with
an
amber
american
beer
you
will
be
more
satisfied
pours
a
pale
amber
colour
with
almost
head
no
lacing
either
small
amount
of
caramel
some
grains
but
mostly
not
too
much
in
the
smell
flavour
is
equally
bland
i
wouldnt
trash
this
beer
because
it
doesnt
taste
bad
it
just
needs
more
flavour
drinkability
this
brew
while
not
bad
left
a
little
to
be
disired
in
all
categories
this
could
be
a
beer
to
drink
when
not
desiring
anything
complicated
nothing
distracting
about
it
and
its
easily
drinkable
drinkability
is
pretty
good
for
a
lager
seeing
as
i
dont
enjoy
the
style
i
had
3
but
had
trouble
getting
the
last
2
down
just
a
lack
of
real
flavor
only
reason
i
even
had
these
is
i
was
receiving
free
beer
for
finishing
the
race
12
oz
bottle
at
boiling
pot
in
rockport
tx
pours
amber
hue
with
a
small
white
head
aroma
is
of
sweet
caramel
malt
light
to
medium
body
medium
carbonation
unpleasant
metallic
taste
made
me
regret
trying
this
beer
i
would
not
try
this
beer
again
poured
into
a
shaker
pint
glass
color
is
a
modest
copperbrown
with
a
slight
head
the
nose
brings
forward
a
bit
of
light
bread
and
some
very
mild
and
earthy
hops
the
taste
combines
a
bit
of
earth
and
a
touch
of
toast
fairly
well
at
least
given
who
the
producer
is
decent
body
and
carbonation
this
isnt
half
bad
drinkability
very
drinkable
because
its
delicious
well
done
indeed
serving
type
bottle
drinkability
goes
down
quite
easily
and
works
well
on
a
hot
day
overall
this
goes
down
very
easy
and
is
a
worthy
go
to
brew
when
ordering
mexican
food
in
a
restaurant
drinkability
this
is
reasonably
drinkable
and
while
not
a
beer
id
go
out
of
my
way
for
it
is
certainly
one
id
drink
again
strictly
a
session
beer
that
is
more
costly
than
is
should
be
really
feel
like
it
is
on
par
with
most
beer
commercial
offerings
in
taste
i
wouldnt
buy
this
again
unless
i
was
going
to
a
party
and
it
was
cheaper
than
budlight
pours
a
deep
reddish
brown
color
with
a
thick
white
head
and
a
little
lacing
smells
of
vanilla
and
roastedtoastedburnt
barley
with
some
broccoli
in
there
tastes
of
vanilla
and
roasted
somewhat
burnt
materials
not
a
fan
maybe
spoiled
mouthfeel
is
thin
and
weak
drinkability
is
decent
overall
its
nothing
special
but
its
not
a
bad
beer
in
my
book
when
in
a
mexican
restaurant
drink
as
the
mexicans
might
enter
dos
equis
it
pours
a
clear
sunset
amber
topped
by
about
a
finger
or
so
of
white
foam
the
nose
comprises
light
burnt
wheat
very
light
roasted
malts
caramel
and
flowers
the
taste
follows
pretty
closely
with
the
roast
toned
down
even
further
a
light
bit
of
toasted
biscuit
comes
in
but
dies
away
just
as
quickly
the
body
is
a
heavyish
light
with
a
moderate
carbonation
and
a
finish
that
really
seems
to
wanna
be
dry
overall
nothing
special
going
on
here
but
enough
drinkability
to
go
with
my
tasty
enchiladas
d
not
a
big
fan
of
this
at
all
cant
say
i
will
grab
this
again
unless
theres
nothing
else
better
to
drink
md
light
to
medium
bodied
but
refreshing
easy
drinking
if
you
dont
expect
much
its
a
nice
option
especially
when
in
mexico
a
go
to
beer
at
most
mexican
restaurants
that
only
stock
corona
modelo
especial
and
other
pisstasting
swill
it
has
no
real
flaws
other
than
its
lack
of
character
rjt
i
didnt
enjoy
this
brew
much
it
poured
an
amber
color
with
a
decent
cap
of
foam
the
aroma
is
grainy
malt
with
a
dash
of
hops
nothing
to
exciting
here
but
decent
enough
the
fermented
grain
on
the
palate
has
an
off
flavor
to
it
a
little
tinny
perhaps
as
the
brew
progressed
this
almost
skunk
like
flavor
strengthened
the
bite
of
bitterness
at
the
end
was
welcome
to
balance
the
malts
well
it
is
not
the
best
beer
i
have
ever
had
but
i
have
to
say
it
is
one
of
the
most
refreshing
it
goes
very
well
with
food
one
of
my
beers
of
choice
at
a
bbq
it
has
a
great
amber
color
a
good
amount
of
carbonation
crisp
taste
and
is
great
for
those
long
summer
days
a
dark
tea
amber
rating
a
21
on
the
srm
chart
clear
with
micro
bubble
action
the
head
was
heavy
soap
bubble
in
texture
with
light
yellow
bubbles
the
head
dissipated
to
a
heavy
lace
ring
that
has
little
clinging
power
roasted
wheat
and
corn
with
a
little
sweet
malt
in
the
aroma
rich
grain
and
malt
flavor
with
a
hint
of
bitterness
the
flavor
is
robust
and
crisp
with
a
good
balance
of
sweetness
and
tart
plays
well
with
my
tongue
and
palate
nice
tingle
and
aftertaste
this
is
a
good
choice
of
brew
with
steak
and
cheese
a
good
party
pleaser
although
the
price
is
a
little
high
i
would
spring
for
this
for
my
discriminating
guests
d
not
bad
for
what
it
is
i
dont
always
drink
dos
equis
but
when
i
do
i
could
do
worse
d
its
lightweight
so
a
good
drinker
i
wont
drink
it
again
unless
its
with
mexican
food
but
interesting
beer
and
an
odd
take
on
a
vienna
lager
pours
a
orangy
amber
color
moderate
offwhite
head
with
some
retention
but
little
lacing
scent
is
a
light
blend
of
light
carmle
candied
brown
sugar
with
a
touch
of
bread
and
grass
taste
is
suprisingly
decent
nice
light
malt
sweetness
with
touches
of
bread
and
grass
not
the
freshest
tasting
but
the
sweetness
covers
that
up
lighter
side
of
medium
bodied
decent
carbonation
a
nice
suprise
of
a
beer
d
decent
beer
with
some
mexican
food
note
started
to
notice
a
little
bit
of
a
corn
flavor
in
the
flavor
nothing
too
much
poured
from
the
bottle
into
a
standard
pint
glass
nice
orangish
red
hue
not
too
dark
with
a
slightly
tan
head
of
about
one
finger
that
doesnt
last
very
long
nor
leave
much
lacing
smell
has
the
grassiness
expected
with
a
typical
lager
but
not
much
else
very
nondescript
taste
is
similar
with
some
slight
maltiness
but
nothing
to
really
distinguish
it
from
others
of
the
same
style
feel
is
really
pretty
good
with
some
light
tight
carbonation
and
a
generally
smooth
finish
overall
it
is
not
terrible
but
really
indistinguishable
from
others
i
will
drink
it
if
it
is
the
only
option
but
will
probably
not
search
it
out
crystal
clear
medium
amber
with
a
thin
white
cap
and
collar
short
lived
streaky
lace
and
decent
head
retention
malty
aroma
essentially
no
discernible
hops
but
they
seem
to
be
there
in
the
background
toasted
slight
fruitiness
brown
sugar
low
bitterness
sugary
toasty
with
a
faint
dark
kilned
and
dry
maltiness
quick
finish
slight
fruitiness
that
keeps
it
from
finishing
really
clean
medium
to
light
bodied
with
slightly
creamy
carbonation
dry
not
bad
at
all
it
works
for
a
vienna
lager
and
is
quite
drinkable
d
this
is
a
nice
and
drinkable
brew
a
light
body
gives
for
a
easy
drink
although
the
flavors
are
not
what
is
calling
me
back
to
the
glass
the
overall
refreshing
taste
wins
it
over
great
mexican
beer
poured
a
deep
amber
into
a
pint
glass
with
a
small
white
head
served
with
a
lime
malty
taste
yet
not
sweet
like
a
bock
some
light
hops
and
grain
flavours
came
through
very
refreshing
beer
and
sweeter
more
of
a
carona
but
better
even
though
its
not
nearly
as
tasty
as
this
beer
have
got
to
admit
after
drinking
two
40
oz
mugs
of
this
every
saturday
at
the
mexican
restuarnt
for
the
past
15
years
i
guess
i
would
have
to
say
i
have
a
good
relationship
with
this
brew
better
than
the
average
american
swillbmc
this
stuff
actually
tastes
pretty
decent
and
goes
down
real
clean
so
if
yer
out
gettin
some
enchaladas
and
such
dont
be
afraid
to
check
this
one
out
stay
thirsty
my
friends
a
watery
dark
beer
rusty
in
colour
with
not
much
head
light
malt
sweetness
on
the
nose
with
some
caramel
and
chestnut
no
freshness
date
id
say
its
about
9
months
on
good
carbonation
a
touch
of
sweetness
in
the
finish
but
mostly
dry
mild
bitterness
mostly
malt
driven
not
bad
a
good
consistent
finish
wouldnt
go
out
of
my
way
for
it
but
wouldnt
avoid
it
either
a
formidable
entry
to
mexicos
lineup
of
macromicros
dos
equis
amber
like
most
other
of
its
genre
gets
by
on
its
exceptional
drinkability
its
almost
as
if
mexicos
beers
were
crafted
solely
with
the
thought
of
guzzling
them
under
the
hot
mexcian
sun
dont
try
drinking
these
in
the
cold
and
dark
of
winter
slightly
skunky
even
with
brown
glass
though
far
lessdisarmingly
so
that
corona
this
is
a
beer
to
be
be
enjoyed
one
after
another
in
the
hot
hot
heat
d
mildly
drinkable
and
refreshing
not
bad
but
far
from
memorable
a
viable
alternative
to
craft
beer
when
in
a
tough
spot
but
nothing
i
would
recommend
d
this
is
just
a
so
so
beer
for
me
a
good
pairing
with
mexican
food
but
compared
to
other
vienna
lagers
this
one
falls
a
bit
short
notes
had
this
on
tap
over
the
weekend
862011
and
it
was
very
creamy
and
smooth
making
it
a
great
session
beer
when
its
flowing
like
that
brown
12oz
bottle
7
29
a
6
pack
taste
reflects
the
nose
nothing
great
but
very
sessionable
12oz
bottle
served
in
my
sa
perfect
pint
poured
a
translucent
copper
with
a
one
inch
loose
bubbly
creamcolored
head
head
eventually
dissipates
into
a
broken
skim
some
spots
and
strands
of
lacing
revealed
during
the
session
decent
adhesion
not
much
happening
in
the
nose
some
light
malts
maybe
a
nutty
quality
taste
consistent
with
nose
not
much
complexity
a
little
watery
and
maybe
a
hint
of
acidity
and
a
little
residual
sweetness
mouthfeel
is
lightbodied
with
a
pleasant
lively
carbonation
and
a
fairly
clean
finish
not
a
a
bad
brew
drinks
easy
and
pairs
well
with
mexican
overall
its
strongest
point
is
probably
its
ability
to
quench
a
mouthful
of
flames
after
too
big
a
bite
of
jalapeno
not
much
of
a
stand
alone
beer
this
is
a
decent
beer
but
really
there
is
not
much
to
it
i
would
put
this
in
the
neutral
beer
category
this
is
something
that
is
only
sessionable
and
not
really
enjoyable
as
a
center
piece
everything
about
this
beer
is
typical
grainy
very
slight
malty
sweetness
mainly
just
carbonated
beer
flavor
i
would
not
highly
recommend
this
unless
it
is
a
hot
day
and
nothing
else
is
available
mouthfeel
is
a
little
watery
and
tingly
it
drinks
good
just
doesnt
have
much
flavor
d
this
is
a
decent
beer
on
its
own
without
any
fruit
wedge
needed
goes
best
with
mexican
dishes
the
mouthfeel
is
decent
it
is
quite
drinkable
my
wife
loves
it
but
i
cant
say
that
i
will
be
drinking
it
again
real
soon
in
general
not
worth
it
i
have
spent
many
nights
ordering
nothing
but
dos
equis
amber
the
lager
is
good
too
but
the
amber
is
the
real
good
stuff
probably
my
favorite
of
the
widely
available
mexican
beers
but
its
still
nothing
too
special
im
not
generally
fond
of
mexican
beer
but
this
was
ok
i
wouldnt
pay
for
another
but
would
drink
it
if
given
to
me
a
friend
told
me
about
this
beer
and
i
finally
tried
it
at
a
local
mexican
restaruant
i
dont
usually
like
dark
beers
but
this
is
quite
good
the
first
two
i
had
were
drafts
and
they
were
refreshing
after
a
long
day
if
youve
read
my
reviews
prior
i
hate
alot
of
carbonation
and
like
a
smooth
beer
without
the
fiz
this
beer
is
just
about
right
very
drinkable
and
without
the
fiz
mouthfeel
was
fairly
light
well
carbonated
it
was
easy
to
go
through
a
pitcher
of
this
decent
mexican
beer
side
note
i
love
the
dos
equis
ads
with
the
most
interesting
man
in
the
world
but
they
did
not
contribute
to
my
purchase
of
this
beer
fantastic
advertising
though
arguably
the
best
mexican
macro
out
there
highly
recommended
as
we
turn
the
corner
into
summer
the
body
of
the
beer
is
medium
and
the
finish
is
lightly
medium
this
beer
is
lacking
a
lot
of
characters
of
a
vienna
lager
it
is
easy
to
drink
because
there
is
not
a
lot
of
flavor
but
it
isnt
nasty
i
would
assume
this
is
a
beer
that
the
locals
dont
drink
south
of
a
couple
boarders
from
here
served
to
me
in
a
pint
glass
with
a
small
head
that
dissapated
quickly
color
is
amber
with
a
dark
undertone
smells
a
bit
bready
with
a
sweet
caramel
hint
taste
is
better
than
anticipated
very
smooth
malt
flavor
that
works
very
well
sweet
caramel
flavor
that
hits
the
spot
without
being
too
unbalanced
hop
profile
is
low
as
it
should
be
easy
drinking
flavorful
beer
that
falls
short
of
boston
lager
but
is
easily
the
best
mexican
macro
ive
had
to
date
stay
thirsty
my
friends
really
good
beer
for
drinking
if
you
want
something
with
mexican
food
i
am
a
huge
proponent
of
drinking
beers
that
match
your
food
and
if
i
could
have
a
bunch
of
these
a
margarita
or
two
and
some
chips
and
salsa
i
would
be
one
happy
sob
its
very
smooth
and
its
actually
smoother
than
their
lager
especial
which
surprised
me
this
is
my
favorite
dos
equis
but
i
do
wish
that
its
abv
was
up
there
with
the
lager
especial
which
actually
tastes
like
a
lighter
beer
go
figure
drink
and
be
merry
well
yeah
the
lack
of
fizz
did
kill
the
thrill
that
mightve
been
had
drinking
this
its
not
all
that
bad
for
what
it
is
a
stagnant
leatherbrown
wannabe
vienna
lager
malty
malt
beverage
in
all
seriousness
a
little
co2
could
be
all
it
needs
to
be
worthy
really
it
wasnt
tasteless
by
any
stretch
just
thick
and
caramelly
in
the
mouth
but
thats
about
it
more
than
2
or
3
in
a
row
and
you
might
find
yourself
wanting
to
lay
down
and
rest
that
gut
happy
cinco
de
mayo
well
it
is
only
slightly
more
interesting
than
a
corona
so
it
isnt
worth
trying
really
technically
faithful
to
style
while
being
a
quick
quaffer
in
hot
weather
given
the
distro
though
probably
the
best
option
in
some
backwaters
it
doesnt
hurt
that
you
can
find
these
things
on
special
at
different
mexican
joints
in
32
oz
mugs
hell
to
the
yea
drinkability
while
nothing
spectacular
this
has
to
be
one
of
the
best
mainstream
lagers
around
always
good
with
standard
fare
and
mexican
food
drinkable
enough
but
kind
of
pricey
for
the
quality
an
enjoyable
enough
amber
lager
there
seems
to
be
a
quiet
beauty
in
its
simplicity
maybe
because
of
the
lack
of
offflavours
and
concentration
on
the
malt
something
that
seems
typically
wanting
in
many
of
its
peers
to
the
north
it
definitely
outshone
what
passes
for
a
mexican
restaurant
plate
here
in
hogtown
pours
a
light
amber
color
nice
carbonation
small
white
head
with
some
sticky
lacing
left
behind
the
nose
is
malty
with
some
hops
slight
caramel
the
taste
is
slightly
sweet
malty
slight
hop
note
light
body
not
drinkable
would
not
buy
again
drinkability
its
cold
and
wet
i
bet
this
is
thirst
quencher
in
the
low
latitudes
in
all
an
average
beer
taste
is
malty
toasted
and
just
a
little
sweet
on
the
finish
just
really
isnt
very
flavorful
or
really
anything
that
makes
it
a
dynamic
or
enjoyable
or
experience
just
a
little
thin
and
quick
drink
particularly
for
a
vienna
lager
it
is
what
it
is
but
its
just
not
that
great
di
guess
better
than
other
macro
imports
but
i
see
why
they
always
offer
the
lime
i
would
avoid
drinkability
goes
down
easy
and
is
enjoyable
for
what
it
is
a
nice
brew
to
have
a
couple
of
with
some
fajitas
probably
not
the
best
representation
of
the
style
but
a
decent
brew
its
fairly
weak
in
taste
but
provides
a
nice
refreshing
experience
this
is
however
the
best
mexican
beer
i
can
think
of
without
a
doubt
this
beer
is
a
one
of
my
gotoos
when
im
eating
mexican
pours
a
deep
amber
color
nice
offwhite
head
smells
of
grain
rice
lime
and
barley
tastes
the
same
mouthfeel
is
light
to
moderate
fullness
this
beer
is
solid
nothing
off
color
its
well
rounded
and
perfect
for
mexipairing
by
itself
on
a
hot
summer
day
with
a
lime
yes
its
ok
its
your
beer
do
with
it
what
you
will
i
like
it
with
and
without
depends
on
my
mood
cheers
d
while
this
is
easy
to
drink
due
to
it
being
a
lighter
body
and
not
the
most
flavorful
vienna
style
beer
its
not
a
very
inspiring
beer
its
better
than
a
lot
of
other
mexican
beers
ive
had
i
say
its
very
average
and
might
be
better
with
some
spicy
food
or
something
i
imagine
this
would
be
even
better
for
enjoying
all
day
long
pool
side
not
something
to
bother
smelling
or
noting
head
retention
just
enjoy
i
want
to
lower
my
score
more
with
every
sip
this
brew
just
does
not
hit
any
marks
that
you
would
look
for
in
a
a
good
brew
it
looks
decent
i
guess
but
is
just
way
too
watery
and
unflavorful
to
recommend
next
time
pass
appeared
ambergold
red
and
consistent
smells
forward
pungent
thick
earthy
a
muddy
taste
grainy
mouthfeel
limit
1
and
this
is
acceptable
and
fun
with
strongspicy
food
looked
forward
to
getting
it
over
with
overall
without
food
did
not
involve
a
lime
maybe
should
have
came
highly
recommended
did
not
deliver
this
was
out
of
the
bottle
and
into
a
pint
glass
have
heard
better
about
tap
and
big
happy
hour
glasses
i
am
pretty
sure
ive
only
had
this
beer
on
tap
i
always
get
this
when
we
go
out
for
mexican
food

for
24

pretty
awesome

smooth
always
complemented
nicely
by
two
slices
of
fresh
lime
this
just
has
a
great
bitter
hop
and
malt
presence
that
can
be
appreciated
by
beer
people
and
casual
drinker
alike
mouthfeel
is
thin
to
medium
drinkability
is
rockin
awesome
before
during
and
after
the
beach
enjoy
this
with
a
burrito
the
size
of
your
head
i
poured
this
beer
into
my
tumbler
at
50
degrees
the
color
was
amber
the
beer
had
good
lacing
the
beer
had
a
bit
of
a
skunky
green
smell
but
did
not
taste
that
way
in
fact
it
is
a
good
ber
taste
is
slightly
sewwt
of
candy
with
a
malty
finish
the
beer
had
no
head
at
all
despite
the
retard
commercials
for
this
beer
i
will
buy
again
stay
drunk
my
tasty
friend1
pours
deep
amber
with
a
nice
head
that
leaves
good
lacing
aroma
is
slightly
grainy
and
thin
flavor
is
slight
but
crisp
with
good
amber
malt
flavor
and
a
hint
of
hops
slight
metallic
character
a
whiff
of
sulfur
flavor
falls
away
to
slight
finish
mouthfeel
is
thin
and
watery
but
not
unpleasant
in
any
case
its
often
king
of
the
molehill
in
a
restaurant
keep
your
coronas
and
limes
away
from
me
and
ill
generally
be
happy
with
this
in
my
pint
glass
i
would
take
one
of
these
over
a
corona
any
day
of
the
week
i
know
it
doesnt
have
the
overpowering
flavor
that
us
hop
heads
love
but
it
still
has
a
good
taste
the
one
thing
about
this
beer
is
the
drinkability
of
it
i
could
take
a
12
pack
of
this
and
have
a
good
night
but
overall
its
easy
to
drink
with
a
good
taste
but
nothing
special
this
beer
is
ok
not
bad
not
great
just
ok
but
if
the
mexican
restaurant
carries
bohemia
get
that
instead
taste
is
similar
lightly
toasty
grain
hints
of
nut
and
mineral
hint
of
caramel
light
grass
hint
of
leaf
its
lightly
sweet
with
faint
bitterness
in
finish
with
a
lingering
toasty
grain
aftertaste
it
becomes
a
bit
watery
and
thin
over
time
mi
rancho
in
germantown
with
the
platos
maria
combo
i
didnt
have
high
hopes
for
this
id
had
it
in
a
bottle
before
and
it
was
a
forgettable
albeit
slightly
darker
mexican
lager
but
on
tap
well
color
is
dark
gold
with
a
nice
head
a
bit
of
bubbles
dancing
through
the
glass
smell
is
all
malt
light
to
moderate
mouthfeel
with
nice
carbonation
taste
is
all
malt
with
something
else
rice
corn
that
provides
a
slick
smooth
maltiness
that
stops
just
short
of
cloying
by
a
slight
hops
bitterness
actually
quite
tasty
and
drinkable
the
light
body
and
carbonation
helps
a
lot
in
that
department
and
while
i
kept
asking
myself
this
is
mexican
beer
while
the
quality
and
drinkability
of
the
product
won
me
over
great
with
mexican
food
and
ill
do
it
again
if
on
tap
fairly
easy
to
drink
a
few
of
these
in
a
sitting
d
not
too
heavy
not
too
light
pretty
good
weight
goes
down
easy
except
for
the
aftertaste
decent
mouthfeel
and
drinkability
drinkability
a
supremely
easy
to
drink
brew
would
i
want
to
drink
more
than
a
few
of
these
only
if
there
was
nothing
else
but
the
standard
bmcimports
fare
it
still
tastes
like
they
didnt
put
much
effort
into
quality
and
taste
but
its
better
than
most
shitty
beers
came
home
and
had
a
stone
levitation
to
end
the
night
on
a
better
note
drinkability
fairly
boring
but
goes
down
smoothly
and
easily
i
drank
this
fairly
rapidly
and
could
drink
a
second
without
complaining
but
id
prefer
something
else
drinkability
not
very
interesting
or
especially
easy
drinking
cheers
i
guess
drinkability
is
just
ok
its
not
a
terrible
beer
but
it
just
doesnt
leave
me
wanting
more
just
an
ok
beer
in
my
opinion
drinkability
kind
of
a
meh
beer
for
me
not
the
best
ive
had
not
the
worst
ive
had
probably
worth
a
try
but
dont
go
out
of
your
way
overall
im
not
impressed
miller
light
is
cheaper
and
offers
just
as
much
d
i
hate
this
so
not
drinkable
cheers
pour
is
amber
as
noted
smells
adjuncty
and
of
sweet
malts
taste
is
of
malt
and
grain
this
beer
may
not
be
the
most
interesting
beer
in
the
world
but
compared
to
the
other
dos
equis
were
leaps
and
bounds
in
the
future
here
ill
be
drinkin
you
with
my
burritos
for
years
to
come
i
think
whos
to
say
though
sorry
rips
next
time
you
might
consider
buying
american
or
at
least
european
notes
its
not
the
best
or
most
complex
vienna
lager
but
it
is
drinkable
with
no
off
putting
flavors
aside
from
the
obvious
mexican
or
texmex
this
might
go
really
well
with
corned
beef
on
rye
drinkability
is
quite
good
it
is
refreshing
and
i
imagine
these
would
dissapear
from
my
glass
quite
rapidly
expecially
if
i
were
having
friends
over
for
mexican
if
if
we
were
gaming
or
having
a
barbecue
i
believe
it
would
go
quite
well
with
most
foods
however
i
can
think
of
a
number
of
better
beers
id
rather
buy
for
approximately
the
same
price
aroma
is
of
toasted
malt
tastes
like
bready
malt
not
as
toasted
as
the
aroma
had
hinted
at
with
an
oaken
cherry
syrup
running
through
it
not
good
per
se
but
good
enough
to
wash
down
some
tex
mex
d
well
i
had
3
or
so
cups
at
a
party
and
i
remembered
why
i
havent
had
it
in
a
very
long
time
but
when
in
rome
this
is
a
low
class
beer
that
i
do
not
mind
that
much
the
color
is
nice
amber
there
is
almost
no
smell
moderate
carbonation
with
a
diffuse
head
nothing
to
speak
of
really
no
lacing
on
the
glass
drinks
fine
minor
aftertaste
does
not
last
does
not
really
affect
the
overall
drinkability
this
is
an
average
beer
again
had
this
a
party
this
weekend
it
was
this
or
coors
light
or
miller
lite
had
this
one
the
color
is
ok
and
along
with
the
head
its
a
nice
amber
and
the
smell
is
malts
and
grain
faint
hops
the
mouth
feel
is
ok
and
yeah
you
can
drink
a
couple
nothing
offensive
here
just
would
never
purchase
this
one
easy
to
drink
yet
hard
to
actually
enjoy
since
theres
nothing
fun
about
this
its
potable
but
thats
it
t
to
be
honest
maybe
i
was
drunk
already
but
it
tasted
very
similar
to
the
dos
equis
regular
lager
out
of
the
green
bottle
pilsnery
and
refreshing
on
a
hot
summer
day
but
its
best
in
that
setting
always
pleasantly
surprised
to
enjoy
this
drink
dont
find
it
in
front
of
me
much
couple
times
a
year
or
so
drinkability
this
is
one
of
my
favorite
drinkin
beers
and
i
can
drink
this
stuff
all
day
and
all
night
while
i
actually
havent
had
a
dos
equis
amber
in
awhile
im
finding
myself
really
enjoying
this
one
not
the
most
complicated
beer
out
there
but
who
said
you
could
only
enjoy
complicated
beers
easy
drinking
with
decent
flavor
and
does
a
good
job
of
washing
down
mexican
food
d
nice
and
drinkable
im
enjoying
it
on
a
nice
hot
day
one
of
the
better
mexican
brews
that
ive
had
id
drink
again
poured
from
a
brown
12
oz
bottle
has
an
amber
color
with
a
12
inch
head
smell
is
mild
a
touch
of
malts
taste
is
malty
a
touch
of
caramel
light
hops
very
easy
drinking
feels
a
bit
light
in
the
mouth
and
overall
this
makes
for
a
good
session
beer
this
is
just
a
good
simple
sit
around
the
fire
on
a
cool
summer
night
with
good
company
on
the
edge
of
a
lake
watching
the
neighbors
across
the
lake
shooting
off
hundred
of
their
own
dollars
in
fireworks
while
playing
guitar
just
to
give
you
a
little
visual
but
really
this
is
a
decent
beer
very
fairly
priced
in
most
locations
good
amberauburn
color
small
and
quickly
dissipating
head
nice
malty
aroma
and
i
may
be
wrong
but
i
believe
there
is
almost
a
slight
woodyness
to
the
beer
very
well
could
have
been
the
where
i
was
that
the
woodyness
came
from
good
crisp
mouth
feel
taste
is
mild
nothing
about
the
beer
will
take
you
back
to
wonder
weather
or
not
youll
be
able
to
finish
the
beer
even
for
those
with
not
so
adventurous
palates
a
very
drinkable
and
enjoyable
beer
this
is
a
great
beer
dos
equis
is
a
truely
great
brand
in
the
world
of
7
dollar
six
packs
and
with
their
amber
beer
they
hit
a
unique
style
of
flavorful
brew
and
melds
perfectly
with
any
spicy
meal
not
only
is
it
flavorful
it
is
drinkable
so
if
you
are
going
for
the
gold
this
is
a
winner
in
all
respects
if
you
are
a
drinker
of
light
beers
and
affordable
pilsners
this
may
come
across
a
bit
too
dark
but
it
is
an
excellent
gateway
to
stronger
beers
while
remaining
in
the
mild
drinkable
category
mexican
brews
may
not
be
the
most
complex
in
the
world
and
this
is
no
exception
but
theyre
all
drinkable
and
they
all
go
well
with
a
big
fat
chimichanga
drinkability
i
thought
this
was
pretty
good
its
something
that
i
could
see
myself
drinking
on
its
own
with
no
food
or
anything
worth
a
try
the
body
of
this
beer
is
mediumlight
with
a
good
amount
of
carbonation
not
too
much
not
too
little
very
drinkable
and
hard
to
dislike
but
still
somehow
not
very
memorable
i
would
drink
this
again
if
it
was
offered
to
me
but
i
definitely
would
not
seek
it
out
on
my
own
or
pay
for
it
its
really
just
okay
this
is
a
very
quaffable
beer
kind
of
like
a
lagerversion
of
a
mild
brown
ale
though
less
cloyingly
sweet
than
a
lot
of
browns
not
a
flavor
bomb
but
definitely
something
i
could
drink
several
of
in
a
sitting
drinkability
easy
to
drink
but
not
much
character
d
for
a
mexican
beer
i
found
it
to
be
pretty
good
normally
i
have
had
bad
experienes
with
them
but
this
is
good
a
hot
weather
beer
or
a
food
chaser
not
terrific
but
one
of
the
fairer
choices
from
mexico
appearance
is
slightly
pleasing
a
crystal
clear
dark
amber
without
any
head
but
some
nice
lacing
smell
is
thin
and
pungent
smells
skunked
even
though
it
came
from
a
keg
just
something
off
about
it
mouthfeel
is
nothing
special
sparkling
water
almost
drinkability
isnt
bad
because
theres
hardly
any
flavor
so
you
can
gulp
one
down
without
giving
it
much
thought
out
of
all
the
mexican
imports
this
has
to
be
one
of
my
two
favorites
much
better
on
draft
than
out
of
the
bottle
and
the
lime
isnt
necessary
even
though
i
receive
one
everytime
i
order
great
with
burritos
or
nachos
really
anything
that
might
be
overly
salty
with
cheese
nice
to
have
on
hand
for
grilling
too
refreshing
d
well
i
would
not
recommend
it
as
there
is
really
nothing
going
on
here
better
option
than
many
macro
types
but
not
worth
seeking
out
ah
not
very
delicious
easy
to
drink
but
mild
at
best
mouthfeel
is
way
light
deceptively
so
for
the
rich
color
so
fairly
underwhelming
i
really
think
this
one
is
better
out
of
the
bottle
for
some
reason
having
it
in
the
glass
just
makes
it
look
better
than
it
tastes
d
goes
down
easy
nice
to
sit
back
with
after
some
yard
work
started
well
but
as
the
review
progressed
it
became
obvious
this
wasnt
a
good
beer
no
matter
what
style
it
is
placed
into
its
got
a
nice
amber
color
to
it
and
it
smells
really
good
until
i
sipped
it
i
got
it
on
tap
and
i
do
not
believe
that
they
cleaned
the
filter
at
all
because
it
tasted
like
metal
and
there
was
no
fizz
in
it
it
was
not
a
good
beer
it
was
only
2
on
tap
and
it
was
because
the
bar
had
too
much
of
it
it
was
a
disappointment
overall
a
pretty
decent
beer
and
compliments
mexican
cuisine
well
not
my
favorite
mexican
beer
but
not
bad
the
feel
of
this
beer
is
light
crisp
and
refreshing
and
is
light
in
abv
so
it
makes
for
a
good
session
beer
this
is
a
fairly
easy
drinking
beer
and
is
a
better
beer
for
hot
days
goes
well
with
steak
it
is
hard
to
know
how
to
think
of
dos
equis
part
of
me
wants
to
praise
it
for
being
much
better
than
corona
the
only
other
beer
i
have
tried
from
mexico
but
in
reality
it
is
a
relatively
average
beer
this
is
more
drinkable
than
most
american
macros
though
drinkability
is
lowered
for
a
bit
of
a
lackluster
appearance
d
i
can
see
it
going
down
bottle
after
bottle
but
for
its
cheap
flavor
and
gross
aftertaste
i
wouldnt
want
to
put
very
many
of
these
back
final
thoughts
decent
amber
lager
makes
for
a
good
session
beer
and
what
dos
equis
should
really
push
worth
a
12
pack
especially
during
the
warmer
weather
overall
pretty
average
but
not
too
bad
ive
had
better
amber
lagers
its
got
a
nice
clear
amber
color
leaning
towards
orange
with
no
real
head
or
lacing
to
speak
of
there
is
a
light
sweet
malt
aroma
with
some
citrusy
hops
showing
promise
but
it
tastes
like
dirty
water
no
complexity
or
character
to
speak
of
its
got
a
light
mouthfeel
and
is
pretty
easy
to
drink
amber
colored
beer
with
a
very
rapidly
fading
head
aroma
is
bread
and
malts
taste
is
the
same
bread
and
malts
with
a
touch
of
caramel
mixed
in
smooth
and
tasty
goes
down
real
easy
recommended
and
something
i
can
see
myself
purchasing
in
the
near
future
from
the
355
ml
bottle
marked
02239
sampled
on
april
25
2009
without
a
lime
wedge
the
pour
is
amber
with
a
slight
haze
to
it
and
a
limited
amount
of
head
that
fades
away
in
short
order
the
aroma
is
kind
of
bready
with
a
tad
bit
of
hops
in
the
background
slightly
below
medium
mouthfeel
but
not
watered
down
by
any
means
the
taste
is
bitter
but
not
in
the
traditional
english
bitter
style
bitter
as
in
sour
or
tart
this
is
a
good
one
for
a
hot
day
drink
a
lot
of
these
20
years
ago
in
a
neighborhood
bar
i
frequented
people
used
to
comment
on
the
dark
beer
i
was
drinking
i
havent
had
one
of
these
lately
and
these
werent
bad
on
tap
especially
with
the
spicy
enchiladas
i
was
eating
nice
to
revisit
dos
xx
in
its
proper
environment
beer
with
a
dark
amber
color
and
coppery
tones
small
head
of
foam
that
disappears
quickly
the
smell
is
floral
hops
is
pleasant
the
taste
have
some
roast
malt
wood
and
some
caramelized
hops
tasty
the
mouthfeel
have
a
medium
bitterness
accompanied
by
a
high
carbonation
little
dry
good
body
in
the
drinkability
i
love
drink
this
beer
with
blue
cheese
drinkabilityfinal
thoughts
overall
very
decent
has
some
decent
flavors
which
are
a
little
watered
down
but
its
not
like
this
is
some
expensive
ale
where
talking
about
this
beer
reminded
me
of
negro
modelo
with
similar
flavors
and
aromas
and
surprised
me
in
a
way
with
its
subtle
oak
wood
like
flavors
pretty
enjoyable
and
very
affordable
id
say
give
this
one
a
try
for
the
flavor
the
price
is
right
cheers
not
horrible
not
good
it
may
be
better
than
most
macros
but
it
is
more
expensive
too
a
decent
amber
lager
i
would
order
this
in
a
mexican
restaurant
but
not
buy
again
off
the
shelves
its
well
constructed
with
no
off
flavors
like
skunk
in
corona
but
uninteresting
it
is
highly
drinkable
drinkability
very
easy
but
horrible
dirty
aftertaste
beer
than
a
bud
but
not
better
than
much
other
drinkability
this
beer
sucks
but
it
still
goes
down
smoother
than
a
lot
of
other
cheap
macros
this
beer
probably
would
have
been
more
satisfying
with
a
meal
for
it
was
pretty
dull
by
itself
however
it
is
definitely
a
more
noble
choice
than
some
other
macro
brews
from
south
of
the
border
which
all
have
one
thing
in
common
this
is
one
of
the
best
beers
available
easily
to
me
that
is
brewed
in
mexico
and
it
is
worth
a
try
i
wouldnt
pass
if
it
was
the
only
thing
around
but
its
not
my
first
choice
pours
a
clear
copper
color
34
inch
head
of
a
white
color
decent
retention
and
decent
lacing
smells
of
slight
hops
up
front
then
pale
malt
and
finally
some
yeast
cleanliness
fits
the
style
of
a
vienna
lager
mouth
feel
is
smooth
and
crisp
with
an
average
carbonation
level
tastes
of
pale
malt
up
front
then
very
slight
hops
and
finishes
with
strong
yeast
cleanliness
overall
just
another
poorly
made
vienna
d
easy
to
drink
just
nothing
to
write
home
about
clearly
not
a
horrible
beer
but
its
just
enough
to
be
average
for
the
style
its
certainly
too
bad
as
it
had
a
potential
to
be
decent
you
could
still
enjoy
it
but
it
would
be
easier
to
just
drink
water
d
overall
this
beer
is
ok
its
better
than
other
macro
beers
but
thats
about
it
theres
better
beers
out
there
that
id
drink
before
this
one

goes
down
good
for
around
20
bucks
a
case
not
to
bad
the
best
mexican
beer
i
ever
had
cheers
i
had
the
beer
at
a
restaurant
and
for
some
reason
they
did
not
managed
to
get
me
a
glass
without
glass
i
am
unable
to
say
anything
about
the
color
really
carbonation
seemed
well
balanced
aroma
was
nice
and
malthop
flavor
was
well
balanced
not
sure
if
it
really
can
be
considered
a
true
vienna
lager
by
style
since
it
appeared
to
be
me
more
of
a
bmc
type
beer
overall
beer
went
down
well
and
i
wouldnt
mind
getting
another
one
at
some
point
despite
the
mainstreet
touch
to
the
style
drinkability
extreme
a
session
beer
in
its
glory
meant
for
drinking
alot
and
quick
but
still
enjoyable
enough
to
be
appreciated
cheap
cheap
and
good
for
the
price
you
pay
for
them
i
can
get
12
for
under
10
bucks
worth
the
buy
good
value
for
what
it
is
medium
carbonation
fairly
light
not
too
watery
true
to
the
cliche
pairs
well
with
mexican
food
and
probably
makes
for
a
nice
lawn
mower
beer
at
the
very
least
i
usually
dont
like
mexican
beers
but
this
one
is
alright
you
dont
even
need
to
shove
citrus
down
the
neck
hell
you
can
actually
pour
it
into
a
glass
overall
for
a
cheap
beer
its
not
too
bad
well
carbonated
and
actually
has
some
flavor
very
easy
to
drink
a
lot
of
overall
a
nice
surprise
better
than
other
traditional
macros
imo
a
little
better
atmosphere
than
the
special
lager
flavor
is
pretty
decent
and
feel
is
not
offensive
overall
decent
quaff
not
a
bad
beer
to
drink
but
not
something
i
get
my
hopes
up
for
not
exciting
but
tolerable
drinks
down
smooth
enough
a
dark
amber
colorwith
light
tan
head
malty
slightly
caramel
aroma
flavor
is
somewhat
fruitywith
toasted
biscut
maltseems
subdued
this
could
be
a
really
good
beer
if
the
flavor
came
out
a
bit
morei
detect
little
if
any
hops
crisp
finishsmooth
mouthfeel
better
if
drank
cold
drinkable
but
not
special
in
any
way
drinkability
is
good
not
much
overpowering
flavor
to
get
in
the
way
of
drinking
lots
of
this
pretty
much
just
a
thirst
quencher
or
pairing
with
mexican
food
when
nothing
better
is
to
be
found
not
a
bad
beer
at
all
but
i
could
never
see
this
being
one
of
my
regulars
the
only
time
i
normally
drink
this
is
at
mexican
restraunts
where
it
is
often
the
only
thing
on
tap
outside
of
bud
light
goes
good
with
mexican
food
almost
always
served
with
lime
dont
drink
and
review
clear
brown
with
a
short
white
head
no
lacing
sweet
aroma
of
caramel
and
cereal
possibly
some
grassy
hops
and
as
this
is
a
mexican
beer
corn
taste
is
the
same
only
watery
works
for
mexican
food
as
there
is
nothing
to
fill
you
up
the
original
xx
is
better
pretty
drinkable
very
average
a
bit
dark
some
caramel
some
malt
forced
carbonation
destroys
the
mouthfeel
overall
pretty
average
uninspired
beer
but
i
suppose
its
better
than
some
of
the
other
awful
mexican
beers
ive
had
this
beer
couldnt
be
any
more
average
to
me
tastes
oddly
similar
to
the
other
dos
equis
out
there
just
darker
in
color
and
maybe
a
small
tad
more
taste
i
mean
its
right
on
par
with
michelob
as
a
mass
produced
amber
lager
but
it
cannot
compete
with
the
microbreweries
with
this
style
they
usually
cost
the
same
price
too
which
makes
it
obsolete
basically
its
drinkable
and
and
quench
your
thirst
but
look
elsewhere
for
well
balanced
tasty
beer
the
taste
is
very
watery
very
weak
and
not
terribly
interesting
but
its
an
okay
beer
its
not
objectionable
by
any
means
the
beer
is
primarily
caramel
malty
but
cheaply
made
with
hints
of
adjunct
sweetner
and
macro
who
knows
what
there
is
a
slight
graininess
to
the
beer
maybe
a
slight
cornyness
to
the
beer
too
dominant
is
the
caramel
malts
and
adjunct
sweetner
the
beer
is
light
bodied
only
moderately
carbonated
and
light
in
the
mouthfeel
no
real
aftertaste
to
speak
of
a
pretty
mediocre
beer
that
works
well
in
the
right
occasions
like
a
mexican
themed
cook
out
pours
a
clear
amber
with
a
small
head
after
a
vigorous
pour
the
quickly
fades
to
a
thin
cap
some
spotty
lacing
is
left
on
the
glass
during
consumption
the
aroma
consists
of
some
malt
and
light
floral
hops
very
subdued
aroma
even
in
my
sam
adams
glass
flavor
is
good
with
a
semidry
flavor
profile
the
malt
is
there
but
again
lacks
any
strength
hops
are
light
and
add
nicely
to
the
finish
has
a
light
body
and
a
bit
overcarbonated
not
harsh
but
just
a
little
fizzy
a
decent
beer
but
lacks
enough
flavor
to
make
it
one
of
the
better
lagers
good
enough
to
drink
but
a
bit
expensive
for
what
it
is
pours
somewhat
dark
with
an
indifferent
head
the
smell
is
very
grainy
mostly
corn
taste
is
alright
the
hops
are
there
just
not
jumping
out
at
you
malt
is
weak
you
get
a
strong
taste
of
grain
in
this
not
as
bad
as
some
but
you
wish
there
was
more
malt
this
is
better
than
corona
thats
not
saying
much
the
mexican
restaurant
has
a
couple
of
sam
adams
products
on
tap
as
well
as
wachusett
ipa
ill
be
having
those
from
now
on
and
not
stray
back
to
this
one
a
very
drinkable
brew
but
as
far
as
amber
or
vienna
lagers
go
this
one
is
certainly
geared
more
toward
the
masses
than
even
the
renowned
sam
adams
boston
lager
not
bad
but
certainly
nothing
exceptional
as
far
as
complexity
goes
still
a
good
alternative
to
the
blander
massmarket
lagers
that
dominate
the
shelves
d
this
is
just
another
massproduced
beer
with
little
to
recommend
it
theres
little
taste
or
character
with
this
one
this
ones
a
nice
spot
start
not
one
for
the
regular
rotation
but
when
the
matchups
are
good
itll
eat
up
some
innings
d
a
decent
beer
to
go
for
at
a
mexican
restaurant
though
not
a
great
example
of
a
vienna
lager
however
it
does
make
for
a
refreshing
beverage
light
bodied
but
not
too
light
and
not
overly
done
with
the
carbonation
this
is
an
easy
drinker
and
im
glad
i
tried
it
again
yes
i
am
my
favorite
mexican
import
great
with
mexican
food
chips
salsa
etc
drinkability
well
its
refreshing
enough
on
a
hot
day
but
it
isnt
the
best
beer
to
do
so
with
id
say
its
a
good
beer
though
just
not
amazing
12
oz
bottle
pours
a
dark
amber
color
with
a
thin
quickly
disappearing
white
head
aroma
of
light
sweet
malts
grass
and
a
touch
of
hops
flavor
is
basically
the
same
slightly
bitter
finish
pretty
smooth
and
somewhat
dry
finish
a
decent
mexican
beer
the
head
on
this
one
starts
out
fairly
thick
w
tiny
bubbles
and
medium
dimples
but
then
fades
away
into
obvlivion
there
is
some
mild
lacing
going
on
the
smell
is
mostly
malts
as
well
as
the
taste
it
does
the
style
justice
and
is
a
great
beer
for
those
just
starting
to
experiment
with
darker
beers
it
is
smooth
and
drinkable
aroma
is
just
not
there
and
the
same
can
be
said
for
the
taste
it
is
very
thin
on
the
palate
and
you
keep
smelling
and
trying
again
so
you
can
write
something
meaningful
but
it
is
just
near
tasteless
add
a
lemon
so
it
tastes
like
lemon
but
the
best
option
is
to
stay
away
i
went
on
the
recommendation
from
the
most
interesting
man
in
the
world
and
it
could
have
been
worse
not
a
good
beer
a
thinnish
seethru
cocoa
puff
brown
that
has
a
small
head
but
does
leave
some
lacings
weak
hop
smell
of
floralearth
notes
mixed
with
a
little
bit
of
sweet
malts
coffee
chocolate
caramel
while
overly
dry
and
husky
on
the
tongue
it
does
have
a
crisp
backbite
from
the
hops
not
much
else
from
the
hops
and
a
semisweetness
from
the
malts
a
little
too
much
of
a
bland
aftertaste
but
this
is
not
a
bad
beer
one
of
the
better
mexican
beers
out
there
pretty
refreshing
i
think
it
might
be
better
with
a
lime
wedge
hangs
head
id
say
this
is
a
little
better
than
your
average
mexican
beer
it
pours
a
dark
amber
color
but
it
tastes
a
lot
lighter
than
it
looks
watery
at
times
easy
drinking
though
and
refreshing
enough
id
be
curious
to
do
a
taste
test
with
this
and
i
dont
know
almost
any
other
mexican
beer
and
see
if
theres
a
difference
i
suspect
this
one
would
be
a
bit
better
than
many
of
the
others
prost
a
very
watery
mouthfeel
but
a
nice
refreshing
beer
probably
the
best
mexican
beer
ive
had
so
far
beats
the
hell
out
of
corona
d
pretty
drinkable
beer
that
is
actually
a
nice
mexican
alternative
d
not
a
terrible
brew
but
average
at
best
and
certainly
a
pretty
lackluster
vienna
lager
though
i
actually
thought
i
was
drinking
an
amber
lager
pours
a
darkish
very
translucent
amber
with
almost
no
head
smells
like
beer
maybe
some
malt
comes
through
a
little
bit
tastes
kind
of
like
bread
but
there
isnt
a
whole
lot
of
taste
to
it
mouthfeel
is
pretty
light
and
makes
it
a
pretty
easy
beer
to
drink
overall
a
very
average
beer
though
it
does
go
down
well
with
some
enchiladas
plenty
light
and
refreshing
very
drinkable
on
a
hot
day
the
mouthfeel
might
be
the
most
disappointing
part
of
the
beer
it
feels
extremely
thin
and
watery
undercarbonated
to
say
the
least
i
dont
really
want
another
one
overall
a
nice
and
refreshing
beer
one
i
bought
by
mistake
but
im
glad
i
had
the
opportunity
to
reevaluate
recommended
not
much
of
interest
here
i
can
think
of
a
mexican
vienna
lager
that
blows
this
out
of
the
water
bohemia
on
its
own
bland
but
generally
inoffensive
the
taste
did
not
match
my
expectations
it
was
very
thin
and
watery
which
made
it
easy
to
drink
but
whod
want
to
tasted
very
sweet
and
citrusy
no
crispness
no
bite
nothing
much
going
on
unpleasantly
surprised
could
drink
a
lot
of
these
one
was
good
with
pork
chop
the
other
night
too
overall
this
is
a
good
brew
for
the
price
d
i
could
drink
this
all
night
it
goes
down
easy
and
smooth
a
great
thirst
quencher
on
a
hot
afternoon
or
with
a
plate
of
mexican
food
dont
knock
this
one
until
you
have
had
it
on
tap
d
this
is
a
great
warm
weather
beer
or
just
a
beer
to
enjoy
when
you
are
broke
grew
up
on
the
stuff
and
it
never
gets
old
to
me
unbalanced
all
malt
like
a
doppelbock
mixed
5050
with
water
expensive
to
boot
due
to
import
status
not
at
all
worth
it
cant
believe
i
had
never
tried
this
before
now
that
i
have
and
id
drink
it
again
maybe
get
some
the
next
time
i
have
mexican
i
seriously
down
about
2
tall
mugs
of
this
stuff
every
time
i
head
out
to
the
local
mexican
restaurant
for
only
3
you
practically
get
two
pints
worth
of
this
stuff
and
its
definitely
a
steal
its
a
great
summer
beer
d
having
this
after
negra
modelo
it
didnt
really
stand
up
to
it
not
a
horrible
choice
overall
though
it
has
its
moments
d
excellent
beer
for
a
hot
summer
day
taste
is
not
overpowering
making
it
easy
to
throw
down
a
couple
at
a
time
an
excellent
choice
for
enjoying
a
couple
at
a
bbq
mouthfeel
is
sessionable
light
crisp
but
not
a
lot
of
flavor
a
far
better
choice
for
a
hot
day
than
an
american
lager
d
despite
the
taste
being
nothing
spectacular
the
mouthfeel
was
fairly
nice
and
pleasant
making
the
beer
easy
to
enjoy
and
nice
to
drink
this
beer
is
definitely
one
i
could
see
myself
drinking
with
some
friends
and
just
chilling
during
the
summer
i
had
this
in
mexico
last
weekend
its
certainly
superior
to
most
mexican
macrolagers
its
a
good
escape
from
corona
and
other
mexican
crap
goes
well
with
authentic
mexican
tacos
notes
tried
this
at
a
mexican
spot
and
it
was
not
bad
at
all
i
probably
wont
buy
this
for
my
home
stockbut
it
is
a
decent
beer
not
complexaverage
for
its
style
this
is
a
great
beer
to
start
the
night
off
with
it
isnt
a
common
corn
and
rice
reliant
domestic
but
it
wont
destroy
your
pallet
either
you
can
drink
one
of
these
and
still
enjoy
heavier
more
pronounced
beers
later
on
in
the
night
i
tried
this
beer
on
march
7
2008
at
smokeless
joes
in
toronto
the
beer
poured
a
solid
reddishbrown
colour
with
a
thin
white
head
the
aroma
was
primarily
grassy
with
a
little
malt
the
mouthfeel
was
mediumbodied
but
highly
carbonated
the
flavour
was
grassy
a
little
malt
and
a
little
sourness
definitely
better
than
a
corona
or
a
tecate
thank
goodness
this
was
included
in
a
beers
of
mexico
mix
pack
from
the
brewery
otherwise
id
have
written
them
off
completely
with
the
exception
of
this
and
bohemia
which
should
replace
sol
in
the
pack
but
cant
for
bottles
size
sake
damn
picked
up
a
six
pack
yesterday
to
celebrate
cinco
de
mayo
and
paired
them
with
a
taco
dinner
poured
into
pilsner
glasses
reddish
orange
color
with
a
thin
wispy
head
that
fizzled
out
quickly
didnt
get
anything
in
the
odor
department
taste
was
somewhat
bland
mostly
just
corn
other
than
the
color
not
much
difference
between
this
amber
lager
and
a
regular
lager
tried
one
with
a
lime
and
one
without
not
much
difference
thin
and
watery
overall
i
guess
its
a
good
beer
if
you
want
to
swig
down
a
few
while
munching
on
some
mexican
but
i
wont
seek
this
one
out
again
a
bit
better
that
corona
if
that
means
anything
i
guess
one
of
the
better
massmarket
mexican
beers
for
sure
kicks
corona
and
all
the
american
macros
ive
tried
in
the
balls
mf
d
kinda
fizzy
but
im
thankful
that
it
doesnt
become
syrupy
as
the
temp
goes
up
perhaps
i
have
all
those
bubbles
to
thank
finish
is
crisp
and
clean
and
there
is
enough
flavor
going
on
the
keep
me
interested
while
putting
back
a
few
of
these
not
a
bad
session
beer
it
has
an
amber
color
with
a
white
head
pleasant
syrupy
flavor
somewhat
like
molasses
smell
is
sweet
but
light
faintly
of
hops
mouthful
was
lite
itd
be
a
good
beer
for
sessions
as
it
doesnt
seem
to
be
as
strong
as
some
other
beers
d
average
drinkability
you
wont
be
wowed
but
actually
wont
totally
turn
you
off
as
well
you
can
drink
this
easily
but
may
disappoint
the
hardcore
fans
of
the
american
amber
style
some
may
sell
this
beer
short
as
it
is
not
as
fullbodied
and
interesting
as
most
us
amber
ales
vienna
lagers
however
in
comparison
to
most
other
mexican
offerings
and
taking
into
consideration
its
design
to
be
a
darker
quenching
brew
for
hotweather
climates
this
is
a
very
good
example
of
what
beers
from
mexico
can
bring
to
the
table
i
have
this
on
tap
every
thursday
at
my
local
mexican
restaurant
is
an
amberbrown
color
with
a
moderate
amount
of
lacing
along
the
glass
taste
is
relatively
bitter
its
kind
of
lacking
and
watery
with
the
mouthfeel
overall
not
a
bad
beer
average
across
the
board
md
the
feel
is
lightly
carbonated
and
watery
with
a
decent
bitterness
to
it
the
drinkability
is
good
for
a
light
beer
to
drink
while
working
or
playing
this
one
can
be
kept
in
a
bottle
or
poured
in
a
glass
the
air
does
enhance
the
flavors
a
bit
and
reduces
some
of
the
carbonation
d
a
decent
beer
for
spicy
foods
like
curry
or
mexican
and
a
decent
macro
but
that
is
all
that
is
really
in
this
beers
favor
this
beer
poured
a
dark
brown
with
a
red
tinge
and
next
to
no
head
the
smell
is
of
sweet
malts
with
a
slight
caramel
scent
the
taste
is
of
slightly
toasted
malts
that
start
off
with
some
sweetness
that
is
cut
with
a
slight
amount
of
hops
the
mouthfeel
is
slightly
watery
with
a
moderate
amount
of
carbonation
the
drinkability
is
pretty
good
for
a
lager
but
id
say
the
best
part
about
this
beer
is
how
well
it
pairs
with
good
mexican
food
smells
and
tastes
clean
alcohol
in
the
smell
and
taste
a
nice
sweetness
comes
through
in
the
sip
this
is
not
a
great
beer
but
better
than
most
lagers
i
have
had
d
easily
drinkable
but
slightly
low
on
malt
character
not
particularly
interesting
but
good
for
what
it
is
and
it
deserves
some
recognition
for
consistently
being
the
best
beer
available
at
most
mexican
restaurants
wow
i
got
this
on
sale
for
5
99
a
sixer
at
the
grocery
pours
a
clear
coppergold
color
w
a
decent
white
frothy
head
which
dissipates
very
quickly
leaving
a
fair
amount
of
lacing
in
my
nonic
very
faint
smell
a
bit
of
floral
hops
w
some
hints
at
graininess
and
a
touch
of
alcohol
a
bit
more
malt
present
here
w
caramellike
flavors
and
hop
bite
initially
followed
by
a
nutty
faintly
metallic
taste
midway
got
the
tradional
munichviennatype
finish
a
bit
watery
dry
light
body
decent
co2
helps
thicken
it
though
overall
a
fairly
decent
vienna
and
at
an
even
cheaper
than
macro
price
this
ones
above
average
on
the
drinkability
scale
in
my
book
easy
to
drink
and
unique
from
other
popular
brews
you
could
do
a
lot
worse
d
perfect
with
mexican
food
among
the
best
mass
produced
mexican
beers
d
its
a
refreshing
beer
and
something
id
drink
when
options
are
short
on
a
mainly
macro
taplist
pours
a
nice
golden
clear
copper
very
attracive
no
real
head
and
not
much
lacing
though
which
takes
away
a
little
from
the
apprearance
smells
of
alcohol
some
malt
and
an
unpleasant
ground
corn
tastes
of
a
slightly
roasted
malt
with
a
slight
trace
of
a
mild
hop
taste
is
much
better
than
the
smell
very
smooth
somewhat
crisp
and
yet
a
tad
dry
very
drinkable
because
it
is
smooth
with
no
bitter
bight
but
has
a
pleasant
flavor
stacks
up
very
well
against
other
macros
on
a
side
note
this
beer
is
best
consumed
out
of
the
bottle
and
with
some
chips
and
salsa
of
course
because
of
the
aroma
smells
like
a
cheap
macro
to
me
is
not
appealing
straight
out
of
the
bottle
this
becomes
a
very
good
easy
drinking
macro
this
is
a
tasty
mexican
lager
and
usually
the
best
one
available
on
draft
at
a
mexican
restaurant
it
pours
nice
with
a
small
head
that
leaves
decent
lacing
it
tastes
of
fresh
malt
with
a
bit
of
noble
hops
it
was
very
drinkable
and
went
great
with
mexican
fare
a
go
to
beer
when
in
a
mexican
joint
for
me
probably
because
nothing
else
decent
is
available
i
find
myself
always
going
back
to
this
beer
pours
an
amber
red
smell
is
of
straw
taste
is
a
malty
sweet
straw
flavor
infinitely
more
flavorable
than
most
other
mexican
offering
readily
available
in
northern
california
but
rather
bland
when
compared
to
good
beers
however
this
beer
does
go
excellent
as
a
thirst
quencher
when
eating
spicy
mexican
food
and
i
find
myself
drinking
it
quite
a
bit
avoid
flavor
has
some
toasted
malt
character
lightly
sweet
with
a
dry
residual
sugar
in
the
aftertaste
hint
of
tart
apple
bitterness
is
there
also
white
grape
but
not
too
pronounced
its
light
also
balanced
with
good
carbonation
and
light
maltiness
after
finishing
one
i
had
another
and
so
did
everyone
else
not
a
bad
choice
but
i
still
prefer
bohemia
as
my
1
mexican
lager
paired
well
with
a
carnitaspulled
pork
dinner
as
a
side
note
this
makes
a
mean
michelada
drinkability
i
wish
that
some
of
these
mexican
chain
restaurants
could
get
some
decent
cervesa
this
beer
is
refreshing
but
not
interesting
enough
to
have
again
overall
better
than
many
not
as
good
as
some
for
the
style
and
for
your
money
just
get
a
good
ol
sam
adams
i
had
this
brew
ontap
at
el
coyotes
in
crestview
hills
ky
it
is
amber
in
color
go
figure
and
is
transparent
in
appearance
the
barkeep
at
el
coyotes
needs
to
learn
how
to
pour
a
beer
there
was
absolutely
no
head
so
therefore
there
was
no
head
retention
to
speak
of
taste
was
average
and
slightly
hopped
this
is
the
perfect
beer
for
enchiladas
if
you
get
into
mexican
food
you
gotta
pair
this
beer
with
it
on
its
own
i
would
skip
it
unless
it
is
the
only
beer
worth
drinking
on
the
happy
hour
menu
d
it
pairs
well
with
mexican
cuisine
and
is
pretty
good
served
at
low
temperatures
good
for
mild
summertime
its
my
standard
when
eating
mexican
mouthfeel
drinkability
a
very
smooth
beer
very
easy
to
drink
these
one
after
another
however
i
dont
know
who
would
actually
want
to
do
that
d
the
primary
saving
grace
of
this
beer
is
the
fact
that
it
is
very
easy
to
drink
and
is
a
decent
thirst
quencher
especially
when
enjoying
hot
mexican
food
this
beer
goes
very
good
with
mexican
food
perfect
to
sip
on
next
time
you
go
to
a
mexican
restaurant
this
was
once
a
vienna
beer
unfortunately
most
of
the
character
has
fled
over
the
years
and
it
is
now
only
slightly
more
interesting
than
michelob
dark
grainy
nose
with
hints
of
malt
nice
color
decent
head
but
fades
fast
flavor
is
dry
for
style
but
not
too
bad
some
decent
malt
notes
hops
virtually
absent
except
in
tail
my
sample
came
with
a
frozen
goblet
which
kept
the
beer
cold
the
whole
time
light
reddish
brown
color
topped
off
by
a
good
head
the
smell
is
dextrin
like
but
much
of
the
aroma
is
muted
by
the
cold
temperature
more
of
the
same
in
the
taste
but
with
a
little
bit
of
caramel
and
a
light
bitterness
to
level
it
out
it
features
the
mexican
trademark
of
a
light
and
easy
drinking
beer
very
similar
to
the
other
mexican
beers
brewed
in
the
vienna
style
keep
this
cold
or
risk
dealing
with
corn
flavors

drinkability
i
wouldnt
stand
up
on
a
chair
and
cheer
about
it
but
its
not
altogether
terrible
actually
d
not
bad
would
not
run
out
and
buy
it
but
good
when
you
are
out
to
dinner
or
having
mexican
food
this
was
a
curiousity
beer
that
i
know
many
folks
enjoy
but
i
still
trying
to
figure
out
why
it
is
what
it
is
nothing
to
make
this
beer
stand
out
but
stylistically
righton
i
would
grab
a
sixer
of
this
in
the
summer
if
it
werent
so
expensive
for
the
price
there
are
definitely
more
interesting
beers
out
there
and
people
that
like
these
kind
of
beers
generally
go
for
much
cheaper
offerings
within
this
style
imho
note
i
see
that
the
abv
isnt
listed
ive
seen
a
couple
of
sources
that
say
4
7
4
8t
overall
a
tasty
and
easy
drinking
lager
certainly
worth
a
try
on
tap
its
rather
meek
and
mild
but
it
pairs
really
well
with
food
and
thats
why
i
give
her
an
a
nice
brownishcopper
in
colr
a
pencil
width
of
head
was
all
that
an
aggressice
pour
would
brong
small
gobs
of
lacing
on
the
sides
of
the
glass
faint
aroma
of
roasted
malt
and
some
very
faint
floral
hop
not
much
there
for
taste
other
than
some
very
faint
malts
and
a
metallic
taste
thats
hard
to
describe
found
it
had
a
slight
plasticlike
aftertaste
maybe
thats
the
old
shoelace
iron
dijn
was
describing
average
mouthfeel
for
a
mexican
beer
somewhat
watery
but
easy
enough
to
drink
on
a
hot
day
would
probably
go
with
something
else
next
time
if
my
buddy
offered
dos
equis
amber
has
dark
caramel
or
copper
color
but
theres
almost
no
head
and
it
dissipated
quickly
a
touch
of
lacing
although
the
smell
is
light
it
was
a
nice
combination
of
lemony
citrus
and
caramel
with
a
general
hoppiness
underneath
nice
carbo
sharpness
in
the
first
part
of
the
taste
then
the
caramel
comes
through
but
its
not
overly
sweet
hops
are
also
around
with
a
touch
of
lemon
highlights
but
its
the
malts
the
stand
out
here
finish
was
mild
and
light
with
just
a
touch
of
dry
mouthfeel
was
light
but
not
watery
and
i
enjoyed
the
carbonation
that
was
about
dead
center
not
too
little
or
too
much
drinkability
like
the
carbonation
ill
call
this
one
down
the
middle
too
its
nice
but
unexceptional
having
said
that
i
should
also
say
its
far
from
bad
a
good
beer
for
passing
the
time
when
you
dont
want
to
beer
to
take
center
stage
of
course
a
good
old
standby
while
visiting
a
latin
eatery
i
do
appreciate
this
beer
although
i
find
myself
only
consuming
it
with
a
meal
not
a
beer
i
drink
without
accompanying
latin
food
it
just
pairs
up
nicely
with
such
amongst
other
large
scale
brewing
companies
i
will
give
this
beer
a
fair
amount
of
credit
the
taste
usually
clouded
by
the
meal
so
i
will
refrain
from
getting
too
deep
with
characteristics
definatly
a
summer
time
mexican
beer
light
bodied
despite
the
slightly
darker
color
decent
choice
for
a
bbq
or
outdoor
party
md
quite
smooth
in
carbonation
and
the
body
is
light
wo
tasting
thin
however
this
beer
succeeds
as
far
as
here
its
super
easydrinking
but
very
boring
amber
lager
desperately
in
need
of
lots
of
other
elements
to
boost
up
the
profile
this
is
one
beer
i
cant
see
having
again
its
a
one
n
done
i
compare
all
amber
beers
to
point
amber
brewed
out
of
stevens
point
wisconsin
and
this
one
is
having
a
hard
time
holding
its
own
in
my
opinion
to
top
it
off
it
cost
me
2
99
for
the
bottle
no
thanks
as
for
drinkability
this
was
a
rather
flavorful
and
easydrinking
mexican
offering
however
too
many
aspects
of
this
beer
seemed
off
i
had
this
at
a
mexican
restaurant
yesterday
and
after
years
of
enjoying
this
largely
from
a
bottle
i
have
to
give
it
some
benefit
of
the
doubt
in
my
review
because
this
sample
was
a
bit
disappointing
although
it
looked
its
usual
beauteous
deep
copper
color
the
head
was
a
bit
thin
on
this
one
modest
lace
the
aroma
was
also
very
thin
and
barely
suggested
some
wheat
perhaps
but
not
much
else
the
head
died
pretty
quickly
and
with
the
first
swig
i
was
surprised
at
how
lifeless
this
was
not
quite
flat
officially
but
definitely
not
what
i
have
come
to
expect
there
is
a
light
carmel
flavor
but
i
also
got
a
slight
metal
detector
reading
there
is
a
fine
carbonation
though
it
is
not
too
powerful
there
is
some
sweet
wheat
noted
but
overall
i
was
disappointed
in
this
on
tap
by
the
bottle
it
is
almost
always
a
winner
and
a
great
choice
with
heavy
food
like
you
might
typically
have
at
a
texmex
restaurant
i
will
have
to
review
a
bottle
to
help
even
up
the
score
here
had
this
at
hooters
tonight
because
well
there
was
a
decent
selection
for
hooters
about
40
beers
but
this
was
the
only
one
i
had
never
had
so
that
was
reason
enough
for
me
pored
a
golden
amber
with
a
slight
reddish
hue
a
big
fizzy
white
head
graced
the
top
and
faded
quickly
leaving
behind
a
decent
little
top
of
film
and
some
residual
lacing
for
a
minute
or
two
nice
carbonation
was
evident
from
the
start
smell
was
very
light
practically
non
existent
here
what
was
there
was
maybe
some
kinda
light
grain
but
it
was
really
faint
maybe
a
touch
of
some
kind
of
bready
yeast
the
taste
was
rather
blah
and
non
descript
your
typical
amber
lager
really
lots
of
malt
no
hops
and
a
touch
of
grain
thats
about
it
pretty
good
mouthfeel
as
the
carbonation
kept
things
pretty
lively
on
the
palate
and
it
went
down
very
smooth
with
a
quick
crisp
finish
very
clean
drinkability
was
above
average
as
very
cold
this
was
one
that
you
could
throw
down
a
ton
of
overall
i
have
had
muc
worse
and
for
a
macro
not
actually
half
bad
went
pretty
damn
well
with
dinner
i
would
definatly
have
one
again
though
i
wouldnt
put
a
sixer
in
my
fridge
more
than
competent
beer
here
and
another
that
stands
out
from
the
carta
blanca
and
corona
clones
of
the
mexican
beer
scene
not
my
favorite
but
worth
drinking
definately
sometimes
the
best
choice
available
unfortunately
thanks
josh
for
the
sample
i
had
this
at
abuelos
the
other
night
abuelos
good
dos
equis
ehhh
served
in
a
pitcher
then
poured
into
frozen
glasses
ehhh
amber
in
color
smell
of
grains
corn
some
light
malts
and
a
lighter
hop
scent
taste
is
somewhat
bland
with
nothing
standing
out
too
much
corny
grainy
sweet
malts
i
dont
find
much
balance
in
this
brew
average
mouthfeel
right
carbonation
and
kind
of
refreshing
once
you
get
past
taste
i
couldnt
really
even
pour
my
second
beer
from
the
pitcher
for
some
reason
i
used
to
enjoy
this
a
little
but
its
lost
what
qualities
i
used
to
see
in
it
for
the
most
part
negra
modelo
es
muy
bien
dos
equis
asi
asi
d
good
stuff
one
of
the
better
beers
to
come
out
of
mexico
but
its
still
nothing
to
get
exticed
about
i
drank
two
with
dinner
and
could
happily
session
a
six
pack
summer
or
winter
had
this
ontap
at
a
hoochie
bar
in
a
plastic
cup
appearance
was
nice
a
hazy
amber
really
with
a
creamy
head
and
sticky
lacing
the
other
facets
of
this
beer
did
not
live
up
to
the
looks
kinda
like
a
good
lookin
girl
who
was
lame
in
bed
bouqet
was
pretty
much
nonexistent
i
tried
to
pick
up
some
aromas
but
did
not
discern
anything
in
particular
maybe
a
touch
of
roasted
grains
taste
is
dry
and
a
bit
creamy
with
a
hint
of
roastiness
mouthfeel
was
ok
drinkability
is
alright
assuming
a
relatively
low
abv
but
theres
really
not
enough
going
on
to
compel
you
to
keep
drinking
this
d
i
am
not
trashing
this
beer
but
it
is
one
that
unforunately
taste
better
freezing
cold
in
a
frosted
mug
at
your
favorite
mexican
food
place
i
understand
that
is
probably
the
best
way
for
me
to
drink
it
drinkability
easy
drinking
beer
would
be
good
on
summer
days
of
working
out
in
the
yard
or
anytime
you
go
to
the
mexican
restaurant
and
dont
want
the
girly
margaritas
mouthfeeldrinkability
its
light
bodied
but
you
kind
of
have
to
choke
it
down
not
drinkable
at
all
it
doesnt
taste
good
overall
its
not
a
good
beer
i
wouldnt
recommend
it
theres
nothing
like
celebrating
cinco
de
mayo
with
a
bad
mexican
beer
the
pour
brought
an
initially
promising
head
retention
that
disapeared
after
the
first
sip
leaving
a
film
atop
that
proved
not
appealing
a
weak
amber
color
caramel
later
confirmed
by
the
watery
texture
and
taste
that
the
brew
makes
no
real
attemp
at
quality
aromas
and
flavors
display
light
caramelization
but
not
enough
to
make
any
meaningful
impact
in
the
brew
flavors
hing
on
graininess
watereddown
cola
and
a
faint
resemblance
to
a
lager
thin
body
and
adjucts
lead
to
astringency
and
residual
grain
and
sugars
on
the
palate
though
the
beer
is
not
awful
it
makes
a
good
run
of
it
best
to
stick
with
the
negra
modelos
next
year
picked
up
at
costco
in
a
mexican
beer
sample
case
of
sol
dos
equis
lager
dos
equis
amber
and
tecate
they
were
out
of
sams
brewmaster
collection
so
this
looked
like
something
good
to
try
not
much
smell
to
speak
of
in
the
bottle
poured
into
my
chalice
a
nice
copper
bronze
color
nice
big
bubble
head
with
good
structure
taste
is
subdued
by
carbonation
similar
to
the
lager
especial
i
previously
reviewed
however
there
is
a
slight
sweetness
followed
with
a
bittersweet
hop
flavoring
this
is
a
refreshing
beer
but
nothing
outstanding
one
of
the
more
flavorful
beer
choices
as
far
as
mexican
lagers
go
pours
a
light
amber
color
with
a
small
white
head
that
fades
to
a
ring
decent
but
subdued
aromas
of
mild
malt
and
grain
nothing
offensive
clean
and
crisp
malt
display
and
refreshing
mild
bitterness
washes
down
burritos
easily
your
best
bet
at
a
mexican
restaurent
if
you
want
to
avoid
skunked
lagers
and
corn
taste
very
drinkable
rather
pale
overall
maybe
served
to
cold
one
of
the
best
mexican
import
lagers
at
least
has
some
malt
character
not
a
great
brew
d
i
got
this
at
a
mexican
restaurant
not
bad
for
a
mexican
beer
its
worth
a
try
d
if
you
are
painted
into
a
corner
its
better
than
most
american
lagers
eric
d
this
is
one
of
the
better
brews
from
mexico
certainly
worth
having
on
a
hot
day
d
interesting
enough
to
be
sessionable
the
flavor
is
growing
on
me
but
the
smell
and
mouthfell
are
lacking
12oz

crystalclear

with
a
thin
light

smells
sweet
and
roasty
like
caramel
and
biscuit
tastes
roasty
and
grainy
and
slightly
watery
with
a
clean
finish
light
body
with
only
moderate
carbonation
better
than
standard
macro
lager
but
nothing
particularly
special
youd
be
better
off
with
negra
modelo
having
said
that
its
a
light
drinkable
pleasant
amber
lager
ive
had
this
and
the
lager
here
in
the
us
and
found
them
lacking
tried
this
again
on
a
recent
trip
to
mexico
and
i
swear
theres
a
difference
the
beer
was
a
dark
brown
with
a
thick
tan
head
it
had
a
nice
malty
aroma
taste
also
malty
with
a
little
caramel
and
some
hops
very
enjoyable
and
it
stood
up
well
with
mexican
food
dos
equis
amber
pours
a
dark
amber
color
with
a
one
inch
white
head
leaving
a
fair
amount
of
lacing
along
the
glass
the
smell
is
malty
with
hints
of
hopvery
nice
the
taste
follows
suit
with
a
crisp
malty
kick
this
beer
is
very
refreshing
and
obviously
goes
well
with
mexican
food
i
had
this
for
years
with
the
lime
but
when
i
had
it
again
for
the
first
time
in
a
while
wo
i
definitely
agree
with
purists
to
leave
limelemons
out
of
beers
i
have
this
beer
only
twice
is
a
nice
beer
but
for
one
or
two
not
more
it
have
a
very
nice
color
darkhave
a
little
hard
taste
but
i
like
it
i
would
drink
it
again
this
is
not
a
beer
for
hot
weather
i
buy
it
from
a
gas
station
for
1
61
including
tax
so
is
cheap
and
you
can
find
it
almost
anywhere
not
a
bad
beer
pretty
tasty
on
a
hot
day
d
pretty
good
very
nice
amber
brew
for
those
hot
summer
days
goes
with
almost
any
food
12
oz
bottle
into
a
mug
pours
a
fairly
nice
amber
color
with
a
small
white
head
that
dissolves
quick
smell
is
grainy
and
sweet
but
very
mild
and
definitely
nothing
good
a
little
metal
tossed
in
there
for
fun
even
coming
from
a
bottle
flavor
is
likewise
shitty
all
crap
sweetness
mostly
grain
straightforward
taste
is
pretty
thin
with
high
carbonation
the
beer
is
bad
plain
and
simple
its
a
macrolager
that
tastes
like
a
macrolager
but
that
color
is
trickily
attractive
so
the
crap
taste
is
all
the
crapper
when
it
hits
your
sad
slowly
grimacing
lips
its
still
better
than
pretty
much
every
american
macro
but
i
guess
i
just
had
expectations
that
were
a
little
too
high
in
any
case
it
sucks
the
dark
brownamber
color
invites
a
taste
smell
is
weak
but
hoppy
and
taste
is
fairly
strong
although
not
complex
it
has
a
good
tingly
mouthfeel
with
minimum
bitterness
though
this
is
not
a
fine
beer
it
is
a
good
companion
to
mexican
dishes
i
would
recommend
this
beer
to
those
who
prefer
a
lager
style
finish
with
a
bite
poured
clear
amber
with
a
white
head
that
dropped
pretty
quickly
aroma
is
very
subtle
almost
not
there
the
taste
is
bigger
than
the
aroma
would
suggest
but
still
pretty
mild
sweet
maltyness
rounded
out
with
bittering
hops
rather
pleasant
overall
better
than
macro
if
youre
in
the
mood
for
something
light
drinkability
not
as
easydrinking
as
you
might
think
for
the
style
its
okay
but
it
doesnt
make
up
for
the
blandness
in
taste
and
aroma
d
it
continues
to
go
very
well
with
spicy
food
as
it
did
with
tonights
enchiladas
very
easy
to
put
a
few
of
these
away
enjoyed
this
beer
with
a
slice
of
lime
did
not
see
much
difference
either
way
as
it
did
just
as
well
without
the
lime
not
in
my
usual
beer
rotation
but
there
arent
many
belgians
at
our
local
mexican
restaurant
nice
amber
color
with
minimal
head
and
the
obligate
lime
slice
not
much
aroma
of
note
essentially
masked
by
the
fruit
taste
was
clean
and
crisp
in
general
malty
with
a
very
little
aftertaste
this
beer
goes
down
very
easily
and
pairs
nicely
with
an
enchilada
poured
from
a
12oz
bottle
with
no
head
really
it
was
amber
duh
it
smelled
of
malt
no
surprise
the
flavor
well
its
malty
had
a
zesty
mouthfeel
good
carbonation
very
drinkable
it
washed
down
our
tacos
quite
nicely
after
two
it
started
tasting
a
lot
like
brooklyn
lager
i
never
noticed
this
maybe
it
was
just
lager
lag
d
tastier
than
i
expected
goes
down
easily
slightly
filling
this
was
not
a
bad
beer
and
i
think
it
is
the
type
of
beer
that
would
go
very
well
with
a
meal
rather
than
just
pounding
it
down
color
is
unimpressive
and
nose
is
decently
malty
with
some
adjuncts
taste
was
reasonably
full
with
a
bit
of
creaminess
in
the
aftertaste
that
i
enjoyed
not
great
but
drinkable
at
mexican
restaurantts
when
all
they
offer
is
bmc
and
corona
and
its
clones
my
second
rated
mexican
beer
after
negra
modelo
not
bad
actually
enjoyable
or
was
it
the
scenery
its
has
a
nice
pour
and
some
simple
malt
aromas
and
tastes
just
a
touch
of
bread
dough
but
enough
to
make
it
pass
mustard
texture
was
good
and
the
low
alcohol
makes
this
one
a
decent
pick
also
tried
this
beer
last
night
it
was
better
than
the
kirin
but
not
by
much
had
a
slightly
sweet
smell
and
i
tasted
a
sugary
almost
caramel
flavor
right
away
a
few
people
i
was
with
had
it
with
a
lime
wedge
after
a
few
more
sips
the
flavor
lessened
but
the
carbonation
remained
high
throughout
the
whole
bottle
better
than
a
corona
if
you
have
the
choice
but
i
still
think
there
are
plenty
more
options
available
that
are
much
better
a
beautiful
looking
beer
with
crystal
amber
clarity
and
a
strong
but
not
big
head
taste
was
lacking
somewhat
in
anything
really
noticable
but
probably
because
it
was
served
too
cold
about
33
degrees
no
hop
aroma
or
bitterness
to
speak
of
well
balanced
by
not
much
maltyness
either
would
be
improved
by
more
body
to
back
up
the
color
not
very
good
pairs
well
with
bad
chain
style
mexican
food
a
perfect
session
beernot
a
lot
of
flavorbut
enjoyableneverless
i
had
previously
reviewed
this
one
from
a
bottle
and
i
have
to
wonder
if
it
was
skunked
from
the
tap
this
was
not
half
bad
nothing
flashy
but
very
drinkable
light
and
refreshing
nicely
balancedif
a
little
forgettable
nice
amber
color
not
much
head
went
great
with
my
enchiladas
mouthfeel
is
a
great
consistency
but
damn
this
is
one
flat
beer
and
still
it
stung
the
mouth
a
tad
amber
brown
color
half
inch
head
fades
fast
smell
is
slightly
fruity
first
taste
very
sweet
apple
with
some
malt
mouthfeel
is
light
not
overly
carbonated
clean
no
lingering
after
taste
but
not
much
else
going
on
there
very
drinkable
very
light
flavered
nice
tasting
beer
i
would
buy
it
again
this
beer
poured
a
clear
amber
color
with
a
big
persistent
head
the
smell
was
sweet
and
malty
the
taste
is
malty
and
kind
of
bland

but
not
bad
the
mouthfeel
is
on
the
heavier
side
of
thin
this
is
a
very
average
but
highly
drinkable
beer
as
it
seems
quite
neutral
in
flavors
my
first
impression
is
that
this
beer
seems
a
little
muddled
up
theres
a
faint
metallic
twinge
along
with
the
faint
roasted
malt
presence
and
a
nuttiness
that
never
really
materializes
like
it
should
the
adjunct
skunkiness
is
present
as
well
but
mostly
its
a
soursweet
combination
like
unsweetened
apple
juice
body
is
thin
and
watery
but
the
carbonation
is
near
perfect
slides
down
like
water
as
well
this
is
an
unexciting
beer
but
still
not
nearly
as
dreadful
as
most
beers
from
mexico
try
it
for
a
change
of
pace
you
may
even
like
it
ive
had
this
many
times
and
i
wouldnt
call
it
bad
it
just
doesnt
leave
me
with
any
particular
memory
to
speak
of
overall
an
ok
if
slightly
bland
beer
probably
worth
a
try
if
theres
nothing
else
available
i
had
this
on
tap
with
dinner
poured
to
an
amber
color
with
offwhite
head
and
okay
lacing
seved
cold
in
a
cold
mug
with
lime
and
i
added
salt
for
extra
effect
and
flavor
while
not
the
typical
beer
we
rate
here
for
taste
flavor
and
appearance
it
was
actually
a
good
beer
given
the
circumstances
while
it
was
no
premium
micro
brew
it
beat
the
hell
out
of
most
macros
on
the
market
and
i
will
likely
have
again
under
similar
circumstances
read
limited
chioices
d
very
drinkable
in
the
warm
south
in
the
summer
one
of
the
better
imports
from
the
land
of
sol
goes
good
with
all
mexican
food
to
tone
down
those
spices
and
heavy
cheese
a
light
version
of
vienna
style
lagers
amber
in
color
large
head
at
first
falls
quickly
though
smells
of
malt
and
grains
taste
is
of
bready
malts
and
a
small
amount
of
a
hop
backbone
to
throw
in
some
bitter
pretty
light
mouthfeel
wish
it
was
a
bit
thicker
still
not
bad
overall
an
ok
mexican
beer
pours
an
amber
color
dont
blink
or
you
might
miss
the
head
disappear
taste
is
bready
malts
and
noticeable
hop
flavor
and
bitterness
i
remembered
this
beer
being
better
than
this
its
not
bad
but
of
the
mexican
vienna
lagers
i
prefer
negra
modelo
this
poured
a
not
too
bad
looking
amber
with
a
boring
head
that
quickly
subsides
to
nothing
smell
is
not
so
nice
rotten
cabbage
and
some
metallic
notes
permeate
the
nose
in
this
one
it
however
really
doesnt
taste
as
bad
as
it
smells
a
sweet
malty
aroma
that
goes
down
very
easily
with
a
smoothness
i
really
did
not
expect
this
is
a
decent
easy
drinking
lager
that
would
go
well
with
hot
spicy
food
or
as
a
refreshing
end
to
a
hot
day
i
havent
had
dos
equis
in
quite
a
while
and
that
was
the
stuff
in
the
green
bottle
visitng
baja
this
pours
an
attractive
caramel
brown
smells
somewhat
sweet
taste
well
here
is
where
im
not
impressed
a
bit
of
a
metallic
taste
along
with
an
average
macro
graininess
to
it
not
as
nice
tasting
as
it
looks
overall
quite
disappointed
its
not
a
drainpour
but
for
any
mexican
vienna
lagers
negra
modelo
is
the
one
to
stick
with
not
this
stuff
above
average
amber
lager
thirst
quenchng
with
some
good
roasted
malt
flavor
body
is
on
the
light
side
of
medium
not
much
of
an
aroma
i
like
this
on
a
hot
summer
night
when
i
am
thirsty
but
looking
for
something
with
a
bit
more
flavor
than
a
basic
macro
i
usually
start
with
this
but
then
move
on
to
a
summit
pale
or
something
but
occasionally
this
will
hit
the
spot
so
good
ill
kick
back
3
or
4
of
these
at
a
time
probably
the
best
mexican
beer
i
have
had
dos
equis
amber
pours
a
copper
color
with
a
thin
white
head
from
a
brown
twelve
ounce
bottle
there
is
very
little
aroma
just
a
hint
of
malt
decent
malty
with
a
mild
caramel
flavor
with
just
a
little
bit
of
hops
pretty
good
compared
to
most
of
the
mexican
beers
ive
tried
worth
a
try
no
lime
necessary
overall
this
beer
got
the
job
done
and
it
was
much
better
than
your
average
carona
they
call
this
fullbodied
on
the
label
is
that
a
joke
my
favorite
local
mexican
restaurant
has
anything
from
flavorful
local
witbeirs
like
johns
white
ale
to
st
bernardus
12
ondraft
so
id
be
hardpressed
to
find
myself
ever
drinking
this
there
flavorful
than
most
macros
but
still
misses
the
mark
doverall
it
is
average
not
much
else
to
say
about
it
really
itll
do
in
a
pinch
this
isnt
a
great
beer
but
for
washing
down
some
mexican
food
its
not
bad
as
far
as
what
to
order
at
a
mexican
restaurant
if
the
choice
is
between
this
and
corona
theres
no
contest
nothing
to
seek
out
on
its
own
merits
either
though
happy
hora
mad
mex
robinson
yes
there
were
many
better
options
but
this
one
i
hadnt
had
since
i
was
underage
so
figured
it
was
time
to
revisit
appears
caramel
amber
with
a
white
creamy
head
leaves
a
trail
of
fine
speckled
lacing
behind
aroma
contains
a
touch
of
metallic
character
touch
of
caramel
sweetness
with
not
much
a
hop
character
to
speak
of
flavor
fruity
note
fizzy
caramel
tone
light
spritzy
citrus
note
a
touch
of
an
herbal
edge
noted
not
bad
at
all
mouthfeel
is
light
bodied
higher
carbonation
doesnt
make
it
undrinkable
drinkability
this
ones
a
decent
go
to
in
a
mexican
restaurant
however
not
at
mad
mex
where
the
selection
doesnt
even
warrant
this
brew
to
be
imbibed
there
nice
toasted
malt
character
but
i
need
a
bit
more
flavor
on
average
to
be
happy
one
of
the
better
if
not
the
best
massproduced
dark
lagers
in
north
america
i
will
usually
get
this
at
restaurants
if
there
isnt
anything
more
interesting
and
will
occasionally
get
a
6pack
if
its
on
sale
though
usually
its
not
any
cheaper
than
buying
a
much
better
beer
crisp
and
lightmedium
in
body
this
is
an
easytodrink
lager
that
offers
a
bit
of
character
in
its
toastiness
notes
run
of
the
mill
massmarketed
lager
a
cut
above
some
mexican
imports
corona
but
not
as
good
as
others
bohemia
the
taste
unfortunately
just
cant
live
up
to
the
appearance
go
with
bohemia
if
its
available
this
beer
is
fairly
light
bodied
and
is
average
in
the
mouth
nothing
out
of
the
ordinary
or
spectacular
this
beer
goes
down
easy
but
i
probably
wont
be
buying
it
again
if
i
want
a
vienna
lager
from
mexico
i
think
that
ill
go
for
negra
modelo
this
beer
just
doesnt
do
it
for
me
this
is
a
good
one
to
accompany
food
nothing
wrong
with
the
beer
but
nothing
exceptional
about
it
either
pours
a
fairly
clear
amber
color
with
a
small
head
minimal
lacing
smell
is
very
mild
malt
light
taste
of
malt
and
some
bitternessbut
once
again
very
mild
mouthfeel
a
bit
thin
nothing
unpleasant
in
the
aftertaste
there
is
enough
flavor
here
to
warrant
drinking
a
few
of
these
but
a
session
beer
should
have
a
little
more
interesting
taste
overall
it
is
better
than
macro
lagers
but
it
is
a
bad
vienna
lager
nothing
in
the
beer
to
make
it
a
beer
worth
seeking
this
is
one
of
the
better
beers
from
mexico
and
for
the
record
i
dont
know
why
people
think
mexican
beer
is
so
awesome
its
not
that
special
poured
a
clear
amber
color
with
a
small
head
of
foam
that
went
away
quickly
aroma
was
malty
with
some
whiffs
of
caramel
in
the
nose
taste
was
a
pleasant
mix
of
sweet
malts
some
nutty
flavors
and
a
faint
flavor
of
cherries
the
mouthfeel
was
fairly
smooth
and
light
on
the
palate
very
easy
drinking
and
actually
paired
well
with
a
cuban
roast
pork
sandwich
however
negra
modelo
has
more
character
and
would
have
been
a
better
choice
limp
head
almost
no
head
even
with
a
wild
pour
looks
whatever
smells
like
industrial
cleaners
tastes
a
bit
like
some
kind
of
berry
koolaid
cotton
candy
dry
mouth
aftertaste
does
not
go
well
with
mexican
or
any
food
its
just
the
kind
of
beer
that
says
i
dont
care
im
just
barely
trying
this
beer
poured
a
rusty
amber
with
a
decent
sized
fizzy
white
head
that
held
for
a
little
bit
but
eventually
left
leaving
some
lace
the
smell
is
all
corny
adjunct
and
really
not
plesant
the
taste
is
a
lot
of
adjunct
but
some
nice
amber
malts
and
balanced
with
some
bitterness
fairly
thin
and
overcarbonated
mouthfeel
but
overall
highly
drinkable
in
a
mexican
resturant
poured
this
into
a
pint
glass
from
the
bottle
it
came
in
appearance
is
a
pleasant
brown
color
that
makes
you
excited
to
try
to
beer
nice
head
that
takes
a
while
to
calm
but
which
leaves
a
decent
lace
smell
is
rather
bitter
and
smells
a
bit
sour
the
taste
is
not
what
i
was
hoping
for
very
bitter
almost
metallic
taste
mouthfeel
is
thin
and
watery
i
could
see
myself
drinking
this
beer
again
but
not
as
a
result
of
my
own
beer
run
still
its
worth
a
try
arent
all
beers
mediocre
but
decent
and
drinkable
pours
out
to
an
amber
color
with
a
vigorus
head
of
foam
that
calms
after
a
minute
or
two
some
lace
and
a
medium
level
of
carbonation
aromas
of
fresh
pancakes
and
malt
with
some
yeast
notes
different
taste
is
bland
and
bare
light
bready
malt
with
some
hop
bite
is
overshadowed
by
cooked
corn
and
cereal
grain
elements
mouthfeel
is
unexceptional
drinkability
is
fair
nothing
offensive
but
nothing
great
either
i
love
xx
i
worked
in
a
mexican
resturant
for
years
and
devoloped
a
taste
for
good
mexican
beers
and
tequila
bohemiaxx
and
petron
it
goes
down
great
in
the
summer
sun
and
quinches
your
thurst
note
the
lime
murdered
the
head
and
didnt
enhance
the
flavor
at
all
nothing
unpleasant
just
nothingness
pale
amber
color
though
it
was
tough
to
get
a
proper
guage
in
the
varied
lighting
of
the
mexican
restaurant
in
which
i
sat
thin
head
disappeared
very
quickly
i
tried
to
keep
my
palette
clean
for
the
first
half
of
this
beer
and
i
was
not
all
that
impressed
the
aroma
was
faint
sweet
and
maybe
slightly
toasty
it
went
down
easy
too
easy
it
seemed
really
thin
watery
not
offering
up
much
complexity
as
i
swished
it
about
easy
enough
to
drink
but
not
all
that
interesting
or
delectable
and
it
paired
very
well
with
crab
tacos
and
warm
tortilla
chips
carbonation
seems
to
be
just
right
and
this
finishes
pretty
clean
flavor
is
primarily
toasted
malt
the
corn
is
more
noticeable
on
the
nose
than
the
pallette
and
the
mouthfeel
is
a
bit
on
the
watery
side
an
average
amber
ale
better
than
some
macro
amber
ales
ive
tried
but
not
one
ill
seek
out
and
this
beer
is
really
easy
to
drink
body
is
just
above
light
with
a
crisp
texture
and
average
drinkability
it
went
well
with
the
mexican
feast
it
accompanied
d
this
most
likely
can
be
sessioned
easy
to
drink
enjoyable
probably
can
go
with
almost
any
meal
good
taste
actually
a
really
nice
beer
i
tend
to
drink
it
with
enough
lime
to
drown
out
any
flavor
but
by
itself
its
very
pleasant
not
the
greatest
beer
in
the
world
but
very
drinkable
da
id
be
willing
to
bet
that
dos
equis
is
considered
cool
on
lansdown
street
right
now
the
beer
smelled
of
light
malts
and
hops
nothing
distinctive
the
taste
was
well
balanced
and
smooth
once
again
nothing
extremely
distinctive
but
that
is
because
of
the
balance
mouthfeeldrinkablility
this
was
a
beer
that
was
made
to
be
easy
to
drink
especially
with
spicy
food
worked
great
to
wash
down
my
burrito
d
overall
an
ok
beer
dispite
the
modest
numbers
but
i
wouldnt
drink
it
on
a
regular
basis
d
i
didnt
buy
this
so
im
not
pissed
about
wasting
money
but
i
would
never
buy
this
the
only
plus
about
it
is
you
can
drink
a
bit
of
it
but
whats
that
worth
in
the
end
opinion
i
dont
really
have
much
to
say
about
this
beer
it
is
really
common
in
the
houston
area
in
all
of
the
little
cantinas
around
it
isnt
objectionable
but
just
really
thin
even
though
i
dont
seek
this
beer
out
i
will
drink
it
over
iced
tea
and
it
actually
tastes
pretty
good
with
lime
juice
in
it
it
is
so
neutral
it
doesnt
take
much
totally
drinkable
with
a
mexican
meal
because
its
light
and
mexican
food
tends
to
be
so
heavy
but
still
not
a
beer
i
would
die
for
cheers2beers
drinkability
not
bad
but
there
are
much
better
beers
for
the
price
d
im
glad
i
only
grabbed
a
single
this
pours
a
nice
dark
reddish
color
with
a
smallish
head
the
smell
is
slightly
fruity
and
maltybut
it
is
very
hard
to
smell
this
the
taste
is
light
and
crisp
and
very
refreshing
with
some
maltiness
and
a
bit
of
fruit
the
mf
is
light
and
alittle
watery
but
not
bad
this
is
a
drinkable
beernot
greatbut
i
can
see
myself
having
this
on
a
hot
summer
afternoon
copper
color
with
a
tannish
head
smell
is
citrusy
and
sweet
vanillay
floral
taste
is
similar
clean
simple
malty
and
slightly
toasty
grainy
mouthfeel
is
a
tad
watery
but
creamy
enough
to
make
it
okay
drinkable
sure
light
and
easy
ive
had
worse
overall
my
second
favorite
mexi
beer
negra
modelo
is
my
fave
nothing
exciting
but
wont
let
you
down
either
this
brew
pours
a
clear
amber
color
the
head
is
onefinger
in
height
white
in
color
and
recedes
quickly
the
aroma
is
what
you
would
expect
from
a
vienna
lager
it
is
rather
sweet
with
some
mild
caramel
and
floral
notes
the
taste
is
a
let
down
after
the
nice
aroma
it
is
watery
above
anything
else
some
sweetness
does
make
itself
present
in
the
aftertaste
but
it
is
very
mild
the
mouthfeel
is
mediumlight
bodied
with
nice
carbonation
it
is
rather
perplexing
in
that
there
are
detectable
residual
sugars
yet
they
leave
to
taste
making
the
mouthfeel
seem
watery
overall
this
brew
isnt
horrible
but
it
is
not
good
either
it
is
not
so
bad
that
i
wouldnt
drink
it
but
if
i
had
a
choice
between
this
brew
and
sa
boston
lager
i
would
choose
boston
lager
ever
time
i
tried
it
straight
from
bottle
but
i
think
is
better
on
tap
i
decided
to
try
this
while
out
to
lunch
recently
i
was
under
the
impresssion
that
this
was
supposed
to
be
the
better
of
the
two
major
mexican
beers
the
other
being
corona
of
course
now
i
cant
figure
out
why
i
took
this
straight
from
the
bottle
so
it
should
get
a
rating
of
3
even
but
im
subtracting
half
a
point
because
there
is
absolutely
no
way
a
beer
this
weak
could
possibly
have
the
right
color
for
the
style
they
claim
they
say
its
a
vienna
red
lager
every
indication
i
got
was
of
an
american
light
lager
and
to
put
this
in
perspective
sam
adams
boston
lager
is
also
a
vienna
style
red
lager
i
defy
anyone
to
sample
this
next
to
a
sam
adams
and
claim
they
both
correctly
fit
the
same
style
smell
was
of
alcohol
and
tiny
bit
of
sour
hops
taste
was
of
sour
hops
alcohol
the
faintest
wiff
of
grain
and
get
this
the
bottle
almost
everyone
who
drinks
beer
has
noticed
the
taste
a
can
imparts
but
how
weak
does
a
beer
have
to
be
to
taste
like
the
glass
bottle
it
came
in
as
weak
as
dos
equis
apparently
eventually
when
i
was
almost
at
the
bottom
of
the
bottle
a
tiny
bit
of
hop
bitterness
and
adjunct
grain
flavor
came
through
but
for
at
least
34
of
the
bottle
a
little
bit
of
sour
a
little
bit
of
alcohol
and
a
lot
of
carbonation
were
the
main
flavors
mouthfeel
was
very
watery
and
fizzy
miller
lite
has
less
carbonation
drinkability
lost
some
points
because
this
beer
is
just
so
weak
you
may
as
well
give
up
and
drink
water
really
it
is
harmless
though
it
was
hard
to
find
anything
objectionable
because
the
lack
of
taste
was
so
complete
if
i
was
going
to
take
a
guess
at
the
recipe
for
this
beer
id
say
drink
half
to
23
of
a
michelob
light
leave
it
out
till
it
gets
warm
and
flat
fill
the
bottle
back
up
with
seltzer
water
and
chill
thatd
probably
be
pretty
close
to
dos
equis
the
weakest
tasting
beer
ive
ever
had
it
tastes
even
weaker
than
coors
light
or
miller
lite
though
it
still
compares
favorably
to
coors
light
because
at
least
what
little
flavor
it
had
wasnt
bad
and
i
can
tell
theres
some
alcohol
in
it
enjoyable
and
certainly
a
good
option
to
pair
with
spicy
mexican
food
with
that
being
said
it
isnt
something
that
i
would
buy
and
take
home
or
would
order
if
i
was
just
hanging
out
in
a
watering
hole
it
is
good
for
what
it
is
and
that
is
a
companion
to
mexican
food
overall
not
a
very
fun
beer
ill
take
sam
adams
any
day
a
light
brown
beer
with
hints
of
red
it
has
a
slightly
roasty
and
sweet
smell
with
a
roasted
grain
and
caramel
flavor
it
also
had
a
bit
of
a
chemical
note
on
the
finish
definitely
thin
in
the
body
but
maybe
im
just
a
little
too
used
to
the
heavier
bodied
oktoberfest
beers
overall
this
beer
is
just
a
little
too
muted
both
flavor
and
aroma
wise
to
be
anything
more
than
average
not
as
good
as
sam
adams
boston
lager
but
overall
i
think
id
rather
drink
this
stuff
if
i
had
to
choose
price
pending
pouring
into
a
glass
provides
a
nice
two
finger
fluffy
head
that
quickly
settles
with
almost
no
lacing
the
color
is
amber
almost
root
beery
little
smell
whats
there
is
mostly
clean
lager
smell
slightly
sweettoasty
taste
is
similar
to
sam
adams
and
other
vienna
lagers
but
with
almost
no
bitterness
its
slightly
sweeter
mouthfeel
and
drinkability
is
fine
nothing
special
as
the
temp
rose
some
off
flavors
began
to
show
went
ok
with
my
slice
of
pizza
not
really
great
but
it
does
have
some
interesting
flavor
at
least
overall
a
good
brew
to
enjoy
with
mexican
food
another
vienna
lager
from
mexico
brewer
country
in
latin
america
rich
in
this
beer
style
this
beer
is
exceptional
but
not
over
negra
modelo
servin
type
in
bottles
and
in
nitro
tap
is
popular
in
the
waist
of
my
country
but
since
the
fusion
of
great
breweries
cuauhtemoc
and
moctezuma
are
distributed
and
enjoyed
across
the
country
not
sold
like
his
sister
xx
lager
the
gren
bottle
is
powerfull
in
its
drinkability
and
smell
lilke
a
real
vienna
lager
ancient
heritage
of
the
veracruzans
brewemasters
everything
about
this
beer
was
average
imo
if
we
were
rating
based
on
country
this
beer
would
be
like
a
44
5
but
within
its
style
its
aveage
to
slightly
below
average
a
little
too
sweet
for
my
liking
the
toasted
nutty
base
character
isnt
as
strong
as
i
would
like
and
the
hops
were
very
weak
the
finish
is
a
bit
sulfuric
and
really
kills
this
beers
chances
of
being
good
with
that
being
said
the
malty
flavors
were
enjoyable
and
the
thickness
of
this
beer
was
nice
average
beer
here
not
worth
the
price
and
id
get
a
bohemia
over
this
any
day
when
at
a
mexican
restaurant
but
its
not
the
worst
option
either
the
taste
is
crisp
and
malty
the
hops
are
barely
there
the
mouthfeel
is
sorta
creamy
and
carbonatedely
crisp
to
the
tounge
this
is
nothing
special
but
it
is
the
most
drinkable
thing
i
have
had
out
of
mexico
the
price
makes
it
pointless
for
me
to
buy
though
as
there
are
much
more
enjoyable
brews
out
there
so
yeah
mehh
not
bad
but
not
impressive
i
dont
need
it
and
i
dont
really
want
to
drink
my
last
5
drinkable
sure
i
just
dont
want
to
here
this
beer
is
good
with
mexican
food
give
me
a
break
it
might
be
the
best
thing
on
most
mexican
restaurants
that
doesnt
mean
you
need
to
drink
beer
with
dinner
i
say
skip
this
beer
it
really
isnt
that
good
i
purchased
my
bottle
in
omaha
drinks
ok
and
useful
to
wash
down
hotspicy
food
but
otherwise
unremarkeable
well
nothing
special
to
say
about
it
it
is
like
the
other
lager
beers
but
a
little
more
bitter
one
of
the
elderest
beers
in
mexico
perhaps
hops
are
obviuosly
there
although
with
a
little
foam
the
taste
is
ok
for
a
while
but
it
is
easy
to
get
tired
of
it
drinkability
from
most
of
the
mexican
beers
lagers
this
one
will
be
had
again
m
lighttomoderate
the
use
of
corn
sugar
adjunct
has
lightened
the
body
making
it
a
nice
summer
drinker
though
id
prefer
a
little
more
malt
flavour
the
beer
itself
had
a
solid
and
recognizable
flavor
a
vienna
lager
it
finished
with
some
bitterness
the
taste
was
surprising
but
not
astonishing
the
style
was
recognizable
but
a
watery
rendition
of
what
i
had
hoped
would
come
of
it
its
a
very
drinkable
beer
though
but
because
of
its
light
mouthfeel
and
accessable
and
not
bad
flavor
not
because
it
is
a
very
superior
brew
in
my
opinion
negra
modelo
is
still
the
best
mexican
lager
ive
tried
and
one
of
the
best
vienna
lagers
ive
had
yet
this
one
although
better
than
the
standard
dos
equis
is
nothing
to
write
home
about
a
nice
beer
to
have
on
occasion
if
the
mood
will
strike
me
which
it
might
but
nothing
to
go
clamoring
make
a
beer
trade
for
drinkability
pretty
smooth
considering
what
it
is
theres
enough
taste
to
make
it
worh
drinking
but
it
wont
overpower
even
a
taco
salad
far
superior
to
the
standard
lager
this
is
actually
a
fairly
respectable
tasty
brew
i
had
mine
in
a
huge
frosted
mug
and
it
paired
perfectly
with
my
spicy
mexican
food
appearance
is
a
nice
deep
amber
and
the
taste
while
not
fierce
in
the
least
does
have
a
nice
refreshing
well
balanced
flavor
i
wouldnt
impress
anyone
with
this
beer
but
it
did
the
job
and
i
respect
it
for
that
orangeamber
color
with
a
decend
lace
for
a
head
the
aroma
is
a
roasted
malt
and
thin
spicy
hop
mediumlight
body
and
moderate
amount
of
carbonation
roasted
malts
and
grains
dominate
the
flavor
a
small
amount
of
hoppy
spice
can
be
detected
dry
kind
of
sweet
finish
overall
a
slighty
above
average
amber
lager
not
something
i
would
buy
on
a
regular
basis
but
always
a
favorite
when
eating
mexican
cuisine
pours
a
light
golden
color
no
head
to
speak
of
and
little
lace
lots
of
carbonation
taste
was
not
bad
lightbut
desent
flavor
has
a
fizzy
feel
that
i
did
not
mind
all
in
all
not
a
bad
beer
i
would
buy
it
again
give
it
a
try
if
you
get
a
chance
i
think
its
a
decent
beer
very
drinkable
but
thats
it
very
average
good
for
casual
drinking
with
friends
or
pairing
it
with
mexican
food
pours
crystal
clear
bronze
soapy
onefinger
head
lacking
retention
almost
no
lacing
the
nose
is
pretty
clean
some
vienna
and
dextrin
malt
aromas
but
not
much
in
the
way
of
hops
sweet
munich
flavor
upfront
which
becomes
more
like
karo
syrup
in
the
aftertaste
pilsener
spiciness
is
suggested
at
but
the
taste
is
mostly
bland
perle
or
hallartau
hops
are
mild
but
present
a
good
balance
light
bodied
and
highly
carbonated
this
has
a
rather
thin
mouthfeel
for
the
style
but
a
high
drinkability
this
beer
is
wellsuited
to
warm
weather
and
mexican
quisine
but
vienna
lovers
will
be
dissapointed
never
had
this
you
would
think
that
i
would
have
at
some
point
but
it
just
has
never
appealed
to
me
until
i
got
a
free
bottle
from
a
friend
pours
out
to
a
crystal
clear
copper
forming
a
modest
offwhite
head
with
poor
retention
and
absent
lacing
carbonation
is
medium
the
aroma
is
of
herbal
english
hops
with
caramel
and
mild
toast
not
really
my
cup
of
tea
although
its
not
bad
for
a
macro
mouthfeel
is
zingy
with
a
light
body
and
crisp
finish
if
i
close
my
eyes
this
tastes
like
a
mix
between
any
domestic
big
3
continental
lager
and
a
german
big
three
dark
lager
the
result
boring
bitterness
is
mild
finish
has
a
touch
of
caramel
sweetness
no
discernable
toast
i
have
no
interest
in
drinking
this
again
appearance
is
reddish
brown
with
beige
foam
and
lace
that
hangs
around
for
a
while
the
aroma
consists
of
roasted
grain
malt
and
minimal
hops
initial
taste
is
clean
and
dry
with
a
hint
of
bitterness
aftertaste
is
sweet
and
pleasant
superior
to
most
other
mexican
imported
beers
goes
well
with
your
favorite
mexican
food
one
finger
of
head
on
top
of
a
darkish
amber
brew
the
head
quickly
drops
to
a
thin
layer
but
retains
to
the
bottom
of
glass
decent
lace
smells
of
mostly
malt
with
a
hint
of
corn
maybe
a
little
hop
smell
smell
is
fairly
faint
tastes
mild
toasted
malt
mostly
fair
body
a
little
thin
for
my
taste
most
definately
one
of
the
best
mexican
beers
ive
had
a
very
decent
brew
especially
when
paired
with
carne
asada
and
a
cheese
enchilada
very
drinkable
for
a
lower
priced
beer
well
for
an
adjunct
german
knockoff
this
is
not
bad
it
has
a
decent
amber
color
and
a
white
head
smells
a
tad
skunky
but
i
think
it
is
more
the
adjuncts
i
smell
as
most
adjunct
beer
smell
like
this
too
me
it
has
a
very
clean
even
taste
there
is
a
decent
hop
presence
but
not
a
desercnable
flavor
it
has
a
good
body
and
is
easily
drinkable
and
forgetable
had
one
at
the
santa
fe
in
hilton
head
sc
pours
a
very
nice
dark
amber
color
with
just
a
little
head
aroma
is
of
faint
roastd
malt
with
just
a
hint
of
hops
just
a
hint
of
bitterness
with
a
good
smooth
sweet
malt
finish
considering
everyone
around
me
was
drinking
corona
i
made
the
best
choice
poured
a
light
amber
crystalline
clear
no
head
whatsoever
i
couldnt
smell
a
darn
thing
really
perhaps
a
bit
of
citrusacid
but
thats
it
malty
and
dry
across
the
tongue
with
not
discernable
finish
it
was
carbonated
just
right
but
left
something
akin
to
battery
taste
on
my
tongue
for
minutes
it
was
easy
all
around
though
so
it
was
another
summereasy
drink
but
nothing
special
its
also
typically
cheaper
than
both
its
ok
dog
drinkability
great
with
red
meats
or
just
to
sit
in
a
hot
afternoon
and
relax
decided
to
stop
being
such
a
butthole
and
give
mexican
beer
a
chance
while
out
for
lunch
one
day
had
this
with
a
veggie
burrito
rather
dark
body
darker
than
i
expected
a
rustycopper
color
with
a
head
that
lingered
smelled
of
faint
malt
and
clean
hops
slight
citrus
light
body
tasted
the
light
malt
and
was
impressed
by
the
moderation
of
the
hops
which
made
everything
extremely
crisp
and
drinkable
not
by
any
means
the
best
beer
but
one
that
i
enjoyed
nonetheless
id
probably
get
this
again
on
tap
with
some
veggie
burritos
this
beer
pours
a
brilliantly
clear
brownamber
color
with
frothy
tan
head
the
aroma
has
notes
of
grain
caramel
and
a
hint
of
herbal
hops
the
taste
is
lightly
sweet
up
front
and
this
sweetness
actually
holds
up
throughout
the
beer
there
is
a
hint
of
bitterness
in
the
finish
as
well
as
some
light
astringency
a
pretty
simplistic
beer
that
has
a
nice
caramel
note
it
though
it
does
have
a
distracting
astringency
vegetal
character
to
it
that
i
dont
find
all
that
good
in
the
end
though
this
is
not
nearly
as
flavorless
as
i
was
expecting
it
to
be
not
a
bad
beer
at
all
i
highly
recommend
pairing
it
with
spicy
foods
or
barbecue
good
finish
good
mouthfeel
right
carbonation
level
order
one
up
the
next
time
you
go
out
for
some
texmex
eatin
poured
a
great
dark
amber
color
with
nice
1
tight
offwhite
head
with
slow
lace
nose
was
light
floral
sweet
tongue
was
even
some
body
but
largely
uneventful
very
little
or
no
hops
swallow
was
a
slightly
bitter
version
of
the
tongue
this
is
a
tough
call
i
would
drink
it
again
but
would
try
something
else
if
it
were
an
option
overalla
nice
stab
at
a
vienna
by
this
mexican
brand
far
better
than
other
mexican
beers
currently
running
over
the
u
s
market
and
a
fine
beer
on
its
own
give
this
a
shot
drinkability
is
pretty
good
because
it
is
very
easy
drinking
this
is
not
a
great
beer
but
is
a
preferred
alternative
more
body
more
flavor
to
most
of
the
fizzy
yellow
mexican
beers
found
in
most
mexican
restaurants
i
enjoyed
the
beer
and
would
have
had
another
poured
with
more
head
than
the
bartend
did
with
this
one
but
the
goblet
was
25
oz
and
i
was
quite
good
where
i
was
remembering
back
to
a
bottled
version
of
the
primary
dos
equis
lager
this
one
is
much
better
will
try
on
tap
on
more
occasions
to
verify
quality
drinkability
i
couldnt
even
finish
my
pint
it
was
so
insipid
notes
if
you
want
mexican
beer
go
with
negra
modelo
its
more
flavorful
than
corona
and
not
skunky
at
all
i
got
my
moneys
worth
but
there
is
nothing
to
write
home
about
i
havent
had
one
in
years
so
i
was
pretty
excited
to
order
one
at
a
mexican
restaurant
the
other
day
the
problem
is
my
tastebuds
have
matured
and
become
a
little
more
sophisticated
since
the
last
time
i
had
a
dos
as
we
used
to
call
them
same
pretty
light
brown
color
virtually
no
head
as
it
arrived
at
my
table
mild
toasty
malt
aroma
everythings
fine
so
far
then
i
had
to
taste
it
watery
and
fizzy
are
the
two
best
adjectives
that
come
to
mind
i
thought
it
was
like
bud
with
a
couple
drops
of
brown
coloring
in
it
drinkable
on
a
hot
day
of
course
but
now
that
sa
is
its
competitor
in
the
viennaamber
lager
category
fugettaboutit
not
bad
i
dont
recall
if
ive
ever
had
the
amber
but
its
superior
to
the
ordinary
dos
equis
it
even
has
a
touch
of
character
i
had
this
beer
poured
from
a
bottle
in
a
mexican
restaurant
in
arizona
its
a
reddish
amber
liquid
with
a
nice
thick
firm
white
head
theres
a
toasted
bready
malt
aroma
with
a
touch
of
hops
the
taste
is
slightly
sweet
clean
and
has
a
notable
malt
presence
the
beer
dries
out
a
little
in
the
finish
which
has
a
good
hop
balance
this
is
a
respectable
drinkable
surprisingly
malty
brew
not
bad
for
this
country
that
is
drinkable
with
some
taste
nice
foam
in
pour
and
amber
colour
works
as
a
vienna
smooth
drink
with
significant
malt
light
mouthfeel
mild
bitter
aftertaste
would
work
with
spicy
food
from
broken
sixpacks
at
lcbo
drinkability
a
very
easy
drinker
nothing
extraordinary
here
but
its
still
good
a
definite
departure
from
most
mexican
beers
i
have
had
miles
apart
from
the
adjunct
lagers
that
are
normally
available
from
mexico
if
it
is
necessary
to
consume
a
mexican
lager
i
would
recommend
to
give
this
a
try
brew
pours
to
an
amber
color
and
is
very
clear
has
a
white
head
that
breaks
down
very
quickly
and
leaves
very
little
lacing
around
the
glass
the
aroma
is
ok
grainy
with
a
malt
flavor
not
to
bad
for
a
mexican
beer
taste
is
pretty
good
highlights
of
malt
and
a
little
citrus
twang
with
a
nice
amount
of
carbonation
not
a
overly
interesting
brew
but
better
than
other
mexican
brews
i
have
had
this
is
a
beer
that
i
could
drink
more
heavily
on
a
warm
summer
day
while
in
the
sun
this
is
a
passable
lager
definitely
better
than
north
american
macro
lagers
but
not
without
na
macro
flaws
its
like
a
corny
macro
lager
with
some
roasty
nutty
specialty
malts
put
in
it
poured
clear
and
amber
with
a
slight
cap
of
froth
smelled
hints
of
grain
maybe
citrus
but
a
definite
floral
tone
taste
wasnt
bad
at
all
hops
are
detected
but
faint
some
grain
maybe
a
small
hint
of
lemon
nothing
over
the
top
but
worthy
of
a
second
if
handed
to
me
i
could
do
this
again
if
another
selection
wasnt
available
maybe
the
next
time
i
go
the
local
authentic
mexican
eatery
had
this
at
hernandos
hideaway
in
toronto
it
came
in
a
really
cool
handmade
looking
glass
with
a
tinted
rim
it
was
a
nice
amber
colour
with
an
offwhite
head
that
laced
well
smell
well
it
was
almost
nonexistant
but
at
least
it
didnt
smell
all
skunky
like
corona
a
bit
of
faint
hops
taste
was
rather
good
some
malts
and
a
bit
of
hops
on
the
finish
but
not
too
many
favours
or
too
much
of
it
but
it
was
really
good
with
the
mexican
meal
it
has
a
nice
light
mouthfeel
that
goes
well
with
the
spiciness
of
mexican
food
too
i
found
it
very
drinkable
despite
its
shortcomings
and
it
definitely
it
the
best
mexican
beer
i
have
tried
so
far
big
foamy
almost
creamylooking
head
from
an
aggressive
pour
head
lasts
for
a
bit
and
is
followed
by
very
subtle
lacing
color
is
a
clear
dark
golden
honey
shade
not
quite
amber
in
my
opinion
smell
is
hardly
detectable
but
is
malty
and
slighty
fruity
first
taste
is
light
but
starts
off
with
a
good
malty
quality
and
finishes
with
just
a
hint
of
bitter
it
doesnt
really
excite
my
tastebuds
beyond
that
mouthfeel
is
light
and
watery
this
beer
isnt
horrible
but
i
think
it
needs
to
be
teamed
up
with
some
good
spicy
food
because
alone
it
really
isnt
that
exciting
consumed
in
october
2004
in
cancun
mexico
from
a
bottle
about
your
typical
mexican
beer
poured
a
medium
copperamber
color
with
a
small
head
and
maybe
the
slightest
of
lace
smelled
like
a
combo
of
corn
and
malt
very
light
carbonation
but
not
super
watery
like
some
of
the
others
maybe
a
tinge
of
sweetness
went
down
pretty
easy
a
decent
beer
for
a
hot
day
on
the
beach
would
have
others
above
it
though
while
in
cancun
thin
in
body
but
flavorful
especially
for
a
national
import
a
little
overcarbonated
for
my
tastes
theres
also
a
touch
of
aluminum
in
the
flavor
and
aftertaste
quaffable
certainly
the
more
flavorful
choice
against
the
other
massmarketed
beers
of
the
world
it
was
medium
bodies
with
decent
mouthfeel
i
would
have
again
if
i
had
limited
options
not
bad
when
compared
to
american
macros
skip
it
an
look
for
something
better
tried
a
small
glass
at
the
goose
island
oktoberfest
beer
academy
pours
a
very
clearn
medium
brown
color
with
small
amounts
of
white
foam
theres
a
light
malt
scent
but
nothing
overpowering
the
taste
is
also
very
light
with
citrusy
hops
and
an
odd
vegetable
flavor
in
the
background
the
mouthfeel
is
nicely
crisp
but
after
a
few
sips
that
green
hopveggie
flavor
starts
to
get
a
bit
annoying
and
unpleasant
when
poured
it
had
nice
amber
color
with
very
little
foam
that
was
the
best
of
this
beer
the
smell
of
any
spices
or
hops
were
not
evident
and
the
taste
was
very
flat
with
no
flavor
what
so
ever
will
never
waste
my
money
or
time
drinking
this
amber
ale
not
one
i
would
go
out
of
my
way
to
get
except
at
a
mexican
restaurant
but
better
than
the
special
lager
this
beer
is
a
very
clear
amber
color
with
a
thick
white
head
moderate
head
retention
with
minimal
lacing
smell
is
malty
taste
also
has
a
mild
malt
flavor
body
is
medium
a
good
beer
to
have
with
a
mexican
entree
but
otherwise
there
is
better
beer
out
there
this
ale
pours
a
clean
amber
with
a
bubbly
of
white
head
has
a
grainy
slightly
sweet
aroma
nothing
that
really
jumps
out
at
you
there
was
alight
hop
sharpness
at
the
begining
of
the
taste
with
alittle
sweetness
in
the
middle
and
a
very
light
finish
drinkable
yes
do
i
want
it
more
no
i
may
still
order
dos
equis
amber
lager
on
occasion
to
wash
down
my
enchiladas
otherwise
never
ive
had
worse
mexican
beer
but
that
doesnt
mean
that
dos
equis
is
anything
to
celebrate
thin
body
but
nice
carbonation
and
i
had
no
problem
downing
a
couple
big
ass
glasses
off
it
during
the
course
of
a
meal
decent
mexican
beer
poured
from
the
jug
a
darker
amber
colour
with
a
bit
of
red
tinge
heavy
one
finger
head
that
lasted
and
lasted
bit
of
a
curtain
lace
on
the
glass
sweet
light
malty
smell
bit
of
sugar
as
well
and
some
pepper
again
sweet
malty
taste
didnt
detect
any
pepper
though
for
a
lighter
taste
this
has
a
bit
of
a
heavy
mouthfeel
creamy
and
thick
highly
drinkable
considering
a
few
of
us
had
5
jugs
of
it
i
bought
this
because
i
like
a
well
made
vienna
and
im
on
a
search
to
find
one
i
like
so
far
its
eliot
ness
but
i
cant
get
this
in
canada
and
st
andre
is
too
bitter
and
weak
this
is
a
revisiting
of
dos
equis
after
having
being
bored
with
it
some
years
ago
the
pour
reveals
a
redamber
beer
with
a
smallish
off
white
cap
that
goes
to
a
ring
quickly
aromas
of
sweet
malt
and
cinnamon
very
subdued
the
start
is
sharp
then
mellows
as
the
sweet
malts
mix
with
the
spicy
tastes
and
tart
hops
the
malt
is
pronounced
and
has
a
layer
of
spicyness
in
balance
with
the
hops
finish
is
clean
and
slightly
dry
with
a
malt
aftertaste
for
now
i
will
grab
a
dexx
if
i
feel
the
need
for
a
vienna
managed
to
sneak
this
one
into
the
festval
of
beers
in
brisbane
but
after
i
tasted
i
wondered
why
i
even
bothered
very
bad
amberred
colour
zero
head
retention
sweet
toffee
and
plastic
watery
they
obviously
used
corn
in
this
one
almost
as
bad
as
the
regular
dos
equis
has
this
ontap
in
a
23oz
tall
glass
this
came
out
with
a
copper
body
and
a
tan
head
that
goes
away
fairly
quickly
leaving
a
slight
amount
of
lace
around
the
glass
the
aroma
is
sweet
with
a
good
amount
of
malt
to
and
a
touch
of
hops
can
be
detected
as
this
warmed
up
taste
is
crisp
and
clean
with
malt
and
grain
being
the
main
contributors
there
is
also
a
slight
sweetness
and
bitterness
in
this
as
well
mouthfeel
is
a
bit
thin
but
not
too
bad
and
it
is
adequately
carbonated
this
is
very
drinkable
and
refreshing
to
have
with
a
mexican
dinner
definitely
my
favorite
beer
to
come
out
of
mexico
oelergud
i
generally
prefer
lighter
hoppier
pilsnerstyle
lagers
but
as
far
as
darker
lagers
go
this
is
one
of
my
favorite
widely
available
beers
seems
like
it
would
be
perfect
to
drink
outside
on
a
hot
summer
day
unlike
many
similar
beers
qualityprice
ratio
is
pretty
good
im
sure
this
wont
be
the
last
one
i
buy
tap
clear
amber
colored
beer
with
a
thick
bubbly
head
with
average
retention
aroma
is
quite
sweet
with
some
weak
malt
also
noticeable
taste
is
quite
pleasant
with
again
some
sweetness
and
a
bit
of
malt
that
can
be
notice
very
refreshing
while
drank
on
a
patio
of
a
mexicantexmex
restaurant
much
more
enjoyable
then
corona
or
sol
but
by
no
mean
is
it
a
complex
or
extreme
beer
slightly
fruity
w
mild
hoppy
aftertaste
decent
for
what
it
is
but
not
an
everyday
beer
or
anything
to
get
excited
about
drinkabity
lets
just
say
i
wouldnt
turn
one
of
these
down
if
one
was
offered
i
wont
make
a
point
ot
buy
more
but
its
not
bad
a
shade
better
than
average
its
head
lasts
a
little
longer
than
most
macros
its
color
is
darker
it
has
more
malt
presence
and
body
but
in
the
end
it
is
still
not
something
i
can
imagine
wanting
to
drink
it
must
be
that
momentary
caramel
sweetness
that
helps
it
sell
there
is
just
not
much
there
and
it
has
a
bad
finish
not
recommended
the
color
is
red
brown
served
with
a
small
head
that
left
some
lacing
smell
was
slightly
sweet
taste
was
very
smooth
a
hint
of
sweetness
and
not
much
of
a
noticeable
hop
characteristic
mouthfeel
was
a
bit
thin
not
a
bad
beer
one
of
the
top
mexican
lagers
will
drink
this
again
if
there
are
not
other
more
interesting
choices
available
at
a
mexican
restaurant
had
a
pint
of
this
on
tap
at
a
mexican
bar
and
restaurant
the
beer
pours
an
amber
color
with
a
big
white
head
and
lots
of
lacing
the
aroma
is
one
of
grain
and
hops
the
flavor
is
malty
with
a
hint
of
hops
bitterness
it
is
refreshing
and
clean
in
the
mouth
and
lead
to
drinking
a
couple
this
one
doesnt
need
the
lime
another
old
friend
always
reliable
this
is
the
only
beer
i
actually
like
with
a
lime
ive
also
only
drank
it
out
of
the
bottle
so
i
am
not
too
sure
of
what
it
looks
like
it
is
slightly
hoppy
with
a
slight
bitterness
to
it
but
the
lime
makes
it
a
citrusy
sour
which
is
great
on
a
hot
day
plus
it
makes
you
pucker
up
a
bit
and
want
to
drink
more
a
couple
of
these
on
a
hot
day
always
help
cool
me
off
this
beer
pours
a
nice
deep
amber
color
with
about
1
finger
of
head
that
quickly
deteriorates
into
only
a
thin
ring
there
is
hardly
any
lace
on
the
side
of
the
glass
the
auroma
of
this
beer
is
mainly
of
roasted
malts
and
not
much
else
the
taste
very
much
mirrors
the
smell
of
this
beer
malt
and
not
much
else
its
not
a
strong
malt
but
very
little
of
the
hops
gets
noticed
not
watery
but
not
overly
malty
this
is
by
far
the
best
beer
to
come
from
south
of
the
border
on
a
hot
summer
day
drinking
many
of
these
would
not
be
a
problem
dos
equis
amber
tastes
very
closely
to
abs
texasonly
beer
ziegenbock
i
think
amber
wins
by
a
nose
both
beers
are
well
worth
drinking
as
session
beers
and
have
similiar
pricing
i
picked
this
up
in
a
12oz
bottle
no
freshness
date
to
be
found
supspicion
might
have
had
a
bad
bottle
pours
a
brown
copper
color
with
little
to
no
head
lacing
was
minimal
with
each
gulp
smell
was
fainly
of
malt
with
an
alcohol
twist
grain
bringing
up
rear
taste
was
very
skunk
and
to
bitter
not
a
good
balance
of
hops
and
malts
at
all
very
dry
amber
and
flat
light
bodies
amber
for
sure
i
would
never
drink
this
again
even
though
i
think
i
might
have
had
a
an
over
dated
beer
pass
on
this
amber
better
ambers
out
there
i
had
this
on
tap
at
don
pablos
it
took
them
three
tries
to
get
through
their
thick
skulls
that
i
did
not
want
a
lime
wedge
stuck
on
the
lip
of
the
schooner
once
they
did
i
was
plesantly
surprised
ive
had
this
several
times
but
id
never
really
turned
a
critical
eye
to
it
before
the
malt
sweetness
and
carbonation
combone
to
make
this
a
drinkable
and
refreshing
beverage
as
far
as
mexican
beers
this
currently
occupies
the
top
spot
for
me
they
go
down
very
easy
and
are
a
fine
accompaniment
for
the
standard
texmex
fare
you
get
in
my
neck
of
the
woods
i
might
not
buy
this
one
off
the
shelf
but
at
dinner
with
some
black
angus
fajitas
this
one
is
always
welcome
but
minus
that
damned
lime
sampled
2604
a
clear
amber
pour
with
a
nice
head
the
nose
is
very
mild
light
fuitiness
takes
some
shape
the
taste
overall
is
bland
almost
no
hoppiness
malts
are
sublte
if
not
hidden
there
seems
to
be
a
pinch
of
citrusy
sweetness
on
the
finish
but
that
fades
quite
fast
a
light
bodied
beer
with
a
decent
mouthfeel
an
easy
drinker
but
little
in
the
way
of
interesting
qualities
amber
brown
color
the
head
was
very
thin
and
disappeared
very
quicly
i
didnt
find
anything
particular
in
the
smell
the
taste
is
malty
a
nice
combination
of
caramel
and
red
fruits
but
without
the
sweetness
the
carbonation
is
weak
hops
are
pretty
much
hidden
a
decent
lager
chestnut
brown
with
foamy
white
head
that
quickly
vanishes
mildly
sweet
grain
aroma
and
nothing
else
aggresive
carbonation
makes
this
beer
bubbly
and
sharp
mild
vienna
malt
flavor
and
a
detectable
macro
cornsyrup
sweetness
kiss
of
the
lightest
most
nonaggresive
hops
in
the
end
finishes
clean
and
the
aftertaste
isnt
all
that
bad
overall
a
better
than
average
macro
that
i
can
stomach
at
chain
mexican
restaurants
this
was
a
pretty
good
mexican
beer
it
poured
a
dark
brownish
color
with
a
thin
fizzy
head
that
faded
quickly
the
smell
was
strong
on
grain
and
malt
the
taste
was
pretty
decent
with
good
malt
flavors
and
a
touch
of
hops
although
the
taste
was
dominated
by
grain
it
was
a
smoothe
flavor
that
went
very
well
with
the
chips
and
salsa
i
had
a
good
mexican
brew
to
get
if
it
is
offered
well
an
amber
mexican
beer
would
be
a
step
up
from
the
average
yellow
lagers
that
are
on
the
market
or
so
at
least
i
used
to
think
so
in
theory
this
xx
amber
pours
out
a
decent
looking
clear
roasted
amber
colour
very
little
head
to
speak
of
with
no
retention
at
all
it
has
a
faint
roasted
malt
aroma
more
on
the
grainyhusky
side
flavour
is
very
mild
and
light
hints
of
roasted
malt
and
metallic
grain
and
something
of
a
trace
of
floral
hops
aftertaste
reminded
me
of
what
chewing
on
a
shoe
lace
might
taste
like
and
i
couldnt
drop
that
sentiment
after
the
first
few
sips
watery
mouthfeel
it
is
easy
enough
to
drink
but
that
aftertaste
ruins
it
for
me
this
would
be
a
beer
that
would
have
to
be
paired
with
something
or
other
preferably
spiced
food
hadnt
had
the
amber
version
of
dos
equis
so
i
gave
it
a
try
pours
the
expected
amber
color
with
a
small
head
and
leaves
no
lacing
on
the
glass
the
aroma
is
pretty
plain
but
there
is
a
little
maltiness
to
it
the
flavor
is
a
little
bland
as
well
but
not
bad
kinda
weak
there
is
a
little
maltiness
in
the
flavor
with
possibly
some
caramel
as
well
pretty
well
done
for
a
south
of
the
border
beer
but
not
spectacular
either
poured
a
decent
enough
amber
brown
color
with
no
head
to
speak
of
not
much
aromayour
basic
beer
smell
id
say
slight
malt
flavor
and
no
real
discernable
hop
bitterness
to
it
very
slight
caramel
or
toffee
flavor
nice
smooth
body
but
again
nothing
special
overall
an
ok
choice
to
go
with
your
mexican
mealsure
beats
a
corona
or
a
sharp
stick
in
the
eye
seems
to
be
a
bit
brighter
when
i
have
had
it
in
a
bottlemight
be
dirty
lines
or
something
similar
here
it
really
is
a
nice
amber
color
in
the
bottle
thats
about
where
the
good
comments
end
has
a
very
harsh
taste
i
guess
thats
the
corn
or
rice
or
whatever
little
tinge
of
alcohol
which
makes
it
slightly
more
palatable
but
id
only
drink
this
from
a
pitcher
at
a
mexican
restaurant
in
the
future
20
less
harsh
with
the
addition
of
that
forbidden
fruit
the
lemon
best
thing
i
can
say
at
least
its
not
mgd
the
dos
equis
amber
poured
a
clear
copper
with
a
fizzy
head
that
quickly
disappeared
it
has
a
sweetish
starchy
malt
aroma
with
some
slight
fruity
hints
like
the
regular
dos
equis
it
is
thin
and
watery
it
tastes
a
little
better
though
the
taste
is
mostly
sweet
malts
and
some
caramel
hints
it
has
a
kind
of
skunky
metallic
finish
though
overall
its
better
than
regular
dos
equis
and
at
the
upper
end
of
macros
still
not
something
i
would
get
again
unless
choices
were
very
slim
not
exactly
a
world
classic
but
something
that
goes
well
with
mexican
food
and
thats
all
you
can
really
ask
a
much
better
choice
than
corona
and
one
that
id
enjoy
again
the
next
time
i
do
eat
mexican
fizzy
head
to
top
of
this
brownish
amber
lager
the
aroma
is
of
faint
hops
and
a
floral
hints
taste
is
a
crisp
fruity
taste
with
hints
of
grains
very
sweet
malts
and
an
almost
sugar
character
without
being
overdone
the
hops
are
present
but
nothing
too
strong
carbonation
plays
a
nice
role
and
the
aftertaste
is
very
sweet
this
is
am
easy
to
drink
lager
and
pairs
well
with
a
mexican
dish
would
be
a
real
treat
in
the
summertime
again
this
is
a
quality
lager
pours
amber
duh
with
a
small
head
that
quickly
dissapated
smells
slightly
sweet
with
a
slight
citrus
element
medium
mouthfeel
medium
carbonation
slight
citrus
flavoring
with
little
aftertaste
decent
mexican
beer
good
with
enchiladas
but
wouldnt
drink
alone
nose
is
all
malt
flavor
starts
as
all
malt
sweetness
then
evolves
into
some
breadynessyeastand
caramel
notes
mild
hopping
i
remember
when
this
was
the
good
stuff
this
is
a
refreshing
and
decent
quality
brew
works
in
a
pinch
when
only
macros
are
available
except
for
looking
reasonably
good
this
beer
doesnt
seem
to
put
forward
much
of
an
effort
inoffensive
but
uninspiring
good
to
wash
down
a
sandwich
with
the
beer
pours
an
amber
color
with
a
thin
white
lace
head
the
aroma
is
decent
it
smells
of
pale
and
light
crystal
malts
with
that
lager
yeast
zing
the
taste
is
good
it
is
refreshing
with
a
light
maltiness
and
some
bitter
hops
its
a
lowmedium
bodied
beer
with
good
carbonation
this
is
a
good
drinking
mexican
lager
reddish
amber
in
color
with
a
small
head
that
is
gone
before
i
know
it
a
few
malt
hints
in
the
smell
i
also
pick
up
something
metallic
as
well
immediately
after
i
try
this
beer
i
an
suprised
how
low
the
carbonation
is
i
am
not
sure
if
this
is
how
all
bottles
are
or
not
the
flavor
is
even
weeker
than
the
smell
it
kind
of
reminds
me
of
newcastle
for
some
reason
but
not
as
sweet
very
easy
drinking
but
lacking
in
flavor
no
born
on
or
best
by
date
so
you
are
taking
your
chances
with
this
one
the
body
is
amber
in
its
truest
form
offwhite
head
that
is
thin
but
tall
in
the
beginning
and
then
quickly
disappears
to
a
lace
that
lingers
around
till
about
half
way
though
the
beer
smell
is
better
than
i
expected
from
a
mexican
import
it
is
sweet
and
a
little
grainy
very
nice
to
the
nose
taste
was
very
clean
and
crisp
though
not
much
flavor
not
very
hoppy
some
malt
but
not
much
very
mellow
only
distinct
favors
i
could
pick
out
were
maybe
some
orange
and
some
corn
a
smokey
aftertaste
its
a
tad
bit
on
the
watery
side
i
think
this
beer
would
be
very
good
with
spicy
mexican
food
it
acts
as
a
pretty
good
thirst
quencher
medium
to
high
carbonation
though
the
mouthfeel
is
still
pretty
smooth
there
is
also
a
little
bit
of
creaminess
to
the
beer
over
all
a
very
very
easy
drinking
beer
this
is
a
decent
mexican
amber
beer
i
drank
it
straight
from
the
bottle
but
it
does
have
a
nice
light
amber
colour
and
a
small
white
head
aromas
are
of
slightly
sweet
bready
malts
and
very
background
floaral
hops
the
taste
is
very
sweet
bready
and
malty
with
a
nice
sweet
floral
hop
afterbite
the
mouthfeel
is
thin
but
not
too
thin
for
this
style
and
the
drinkability
is
damn
good
for
a
mexican
beer
decent
it
pours
an
impressive
dark
body
with
a
strong
yet
pleasent
nose
the
taste
is
crisp
and
inviting
with
none
of
the
brackish
after
taste
that
you
get
sometimes
dos
equis
impressed
me
after
all
these
years
and
would
be
a
nice
session
beer
would
go
nice
with
your
typical
bar
food
i
had
this
with
chorizo
enchiladas
and
was
a
great
compliment
to
the
spiciness
of
the
sausage
definately
a
dinner
beer
thats
to
be
consumed
with
food
from
its
home
country
not
a
world
beater
tho
i
did
rather
enjoy
it
over
the
meal
and
would
drink
it
again
next
time
im
having
mexican
food
prost
overall
a
real
bummer
of
a
brew
minimal
head
and
a
sour
maltiness
are
the
first
things
noticed
in
this
one
light
bodied
and
fairly
lean
in
the
mouth
with
a
tangy
malted
twang
quite
carbonatednot
a
lot
of
flavor
and
even
a
bit
dilute
however
this
is
a
sound
choice
if
you
cant
find
bohemia
at
your
next
mexican
feast
mouth
feel
was
good
pretty
malty
definitely
not
watery
pours
a
brownish
amber
colour
with
little
or
no
head
this
could
be
due
to
the
freezing
mug
it
was
served
indespite
my
request
at
first
no
smell
but
once
it
warmed
there
was
a
bit
off
malt
on
the
nose
but
not
much
else
the
taste
was
ok
it
had
a
balance
of
slightly
toasted
maltyness
with
just
enough
hops
to
keep
it
dry
overall
one
of
my
favourite
mexican
beers
i
will
have
it
when
i
go
out
to
eat
mexican
food
or
at
some
sort
of
fiesta
but
i
wouldnt
go
out
and
buy
it
for
a
session
beer
any
time
soon
drinkability
not
the
worst
beer
ive
ever
had
but
overall
rather
bland
and
uninteresting
drink
it
if
youre
handed
one
but
i
can
think
of
a
lot
of
things
id
rather
be
drinking
two
ways
to
describe
this
better
than
corona
not
as
good
as
carta
blanca
basically
a
somewhat
flat
lager
nothing
exceptional
about
it
i
tried
it
one
night
after
dinner
and
i
got
the
same
impression
from
this
beer
as
other
mexican
brews
although
i
think
xx
had
a
bit
more
alcohol
this
was
yet
another
below
average
beer
save
the
dinero
and
buy
americano
or
carta
blanca
drinkability

not
the
tastiest
beer
in
the
world
but
fine
for
a
hot
summer
day
overall
not
too
bad
a
beer
pretty
average
in
fact
does
a
good
job
of
smothering
some
spicy
mexican
food
not
a
beer
im
going
to
stock
my
fridge
with
though
dark
amber
color
small
head
vienna
style
lager
slightly
caramelized
malts
slightly
hoppy
mouthfeel
is
slightly
malty
balance
is
ok
flavor
is
mild
but
acceptable
mouthfeel
is
very
thin
sort
of
watery
finish
is
crisp
and
clean
aftertaste
is
slightly
bitter
this
is
better
than
most
mexican
beers
it
pours
a
medium
to
dark
amberbrown
it
has
no
nose
at
all
that
i
could
detect
which
is
better
than
smelling
like
an
american
macro
the
taste
begins
sort
of
mellow
and
finishes
out
on
the
back
of
the
tongue
with
some
uninteresting
maltiness
balanced
out
with
some
bittering
hops
not
much
of
a
head
its
ok
at
chichis
if
theres
nothing
else
there
not
a
very
drinkable
beer
in
my
opinion
its
to
watery
and
yet
is
harsh
worse
than
i
expected
very
smooth
crisp
clean
taste
with
the
dominate
flavor
of
dry
malt
medium
body
that
finishes
with
a
slight
hop
and
mineral
taste
goes
down
very
smooth
and
very
easy
one
of
the
top
selections
of
mexican
beers
available
at
nearly
every
mexican
restaurant
pairs
well
with
the
food
and
much
better
than
the
other
xx
offering
and
head
and
way
above
a
corona
xx
amber
is
way
ahead
of
xx
special
lager
in
the
flavor
department
but
lacks
the
character
of
negra
modelo
this
stuff
is
easy
to
drink
and
might
be
a
wise
selection
at
a
mexican
eatery
not
much
to
report
i
might
drink
another
one
if
offered
i
would
never
buy
it
nothing
too
exciting
going
on
here
pours
a
dark
amber
color
with
a
medium
and
foamy
light
beige
head
aroma
of
light
malt
rather
lightbodied
with
very
little
flavor
lightly
sweet
finish
my
money
is
on
negra
modelo
or
victoria
over
this
any
day
as
far
as
mexican
viennas
go
in
a
word
unobtrusive
i
had
this
at
a
local
mexican
restaurant
with
some
enchiladas
and
tacos
pours
an
amber
color
topped
off
by
a
tiny
head
that
settles
down
very
quickly
the
aroma
is
malty
with
mild
hops
caramel
and
fruit
undertones
the
taste
is
like
any
other
average
run
of
the
mill
vienna
lager
the
carbonation
level
is
a
bit
too
high
for
this
style
of
beer
even
though
i
didnt
really
care
much
for
this
one
its
still
better
than
corona
pours
from
the
bottle
a
dark
amber
with
a
pretty
large
light
tan
head
that
quickly
diminished
to
leave
a
minimal
lacing
aroma
was
quite
light
mostly
sweet
corn
with
some
toasted
smell
hinting
in
the
back
flavor
is
almost
purely
sweet
like
corn
and
caramel
mixed
again
there
was
some
toasty
malt
flavors
hinting
at
the
end
quite
watery
and
overly
carbonated
a
good
solid
beer
with
the
desire
to
please
decent
dark
lager
coloration
with
a
small
nonretentive
head
minimal
lacing
the
taste
and
smell
are
of
grain
enough
hop
sense
to
moderate
the
malt
sweetness
this
is
a
good
beer
with
mexican
food
as
it
blends
well
with
tortillas
and
quenches
the
spices
that
are
present
this
is
a
good
goto
beer
in
many
seetings
where
macros
predominate
pours
brownishamber
with
little
head
that
thins
out
to
leave
a
ring
around
your
pint
glass
slight
malt
aroma
but
not
strong
smooth
taste
some
malt
slight
carbonation
easy
to
drink
not
a
bad
tasting
lager
better
than
corona
and
its
lighter
relative
dos
x
pours
somewhat
dark
with
an
indifferent
head
the
smell
is
of
grains
mostly
corn
taste
is
smooth
the
hops
are
there
just
not
jumping
out
at
you
malt
is
weak
you
get
a
strong
taste
of
grain
in
this
not
as
bad
as
some
but
you
wish
there
was
more
malt
this
is
better
than
corona
thats
not
saying
much
still
worth
a
try
if
your
at
a
nice
mexican
bistro
all
in
all
this
is
a
good
beer
to
be
served
with
chips
salsa
and
texas
cheese
enchiladas
a
clear
darkish
amber
pour
with
minimal
had
and
almost
no
lacing
generally
put
this
is
an
inoffensive
beer
but
hardly
a
noteworthy
one
smell
is
dominated
by
grains
with
bready
and
floral
notes
less
prominent
taste
starts
out
clean
and
crisp
moving
quickly
to
a
bready
middle
and
a
sweet
malty
finish
mouthfeel
is
rather
sticky
with
the
aftertaste
flavors
clinging
a
bit
pours
dark
amber
in
color
with
a
thin
white
head
that
immediately
fades
into
a
thin
lace
nose
is
lightly
toasted
sweet
malts
and
grains
with
a
touch
of
spicy
hops
taste
is
sweet
and
crisp
up
front
followed
by
some
malty
and
bready
notes
mildy
bitter
hops
are
present
in
a
dry
finish
one
of
the
better
lagers
from
mexico
goes
great
with
a
plate
of
spicy
texmex
very
nice
little
brew
from
our
neighbors
down
south
has
nice
color
to
it
and
a
little
head
to
it
as
well
finishes
smooth
and
leaves
you
wanting
more
has
a
little
bite
to
the
first
taste
i
like
it
almost
as
much
as
bohemia
and
negra
modelo
darn
good
for
the
price
too
i
think
its
like
6
a
sixer
which
is
good
for
a
good
beer
the
colour
however
was
nice
a
very
deep
amber
with
a
large
island
lace
and
thick
glass
ring
pours
a
decent
amber
hue
with
a
white
head
not
a
bad
beer
not
exactly
like
the
other
vienna
lagers
i
have
tried
more
along
the
lines
of
a
traditional
american
lager
with
a
little
bit
of
extra
malt
if
i
have
one
of
these
in
my
hand
you
know
i
am
enjoying
some
mexican
food
which
it
pairs
well
with
the
pour
a
cloudless
amber
gold
color
the
head
modest
and
the
lace
sufficient
to
coat
the
glass
nose
is
all
malt
crisp
and
fresh
front
lightly
sweet
with
a
slender
top
finish
is
quite
acidic
the
hops
adequate
and
the
aftertaste
dry
as
i
said
before
a
good
drinking
beer
that
is
pleasant
to
the
palate
and
always
acceptable
to
me
pours
a
deep
amber
under
a
nice
sticky
head
toasty
metal
grass
nose
wellbalanced
through
a
draught
although
somewhat
of
a
contrived
sweetness
lingers
along
with
the
mild
hops
clean
and
quenching
and
a
fine
choice
for
washing
down
some
tasty
chilaquiles
usually
i
am
not
a
big
fan
of
mexican
beers
but
this
one
definitely
stands
out
from
the
crowd
it
pours
a
rich
amber
color
with
a
very
weak
head
that
fades
to
alomst
nothing
within
a
minute
it
has
a
light
aroma
consisting
mostly
of
hops
there
is
minimal
bitterness
and
the
taste
is
not
at
all
complex
like
the
smell
but
you
can
percieve
hints
of
caramel
the
mouthfeel
is
alright
there
is
a
slight
carbonation
fizz
and
it
is
tad
bit
watery
it
is
very
drinkable
though
it
is
smooth
and
goes
down
quite
easy
while
although
i
gave
this
brew
a
kind
of
average
review
i
do
enjoy
it
quite
a
bit
and
will
surely
purchase
it
again
in
the
future
plus
this
is
my
favorite
beer
to
drink
with
mexican
food
pours
an
amber
colour
with
topped
by
a
poor
head
that
settles
down
quiyte
easily
the
aroma
is
malty
and
light
hints
of
fruits
flavor
nothing
special
really
i
wouldnt
look
for
this
beer
again
carbonation
is
quite
poor
and
mouthfeel
is
average
i
havent
discovered
a
decent
mexican
lager
yet
and
this
vienna
style
lager
wont
make
me
change
my
opinion
the
flavor
of
most
mexican
lagers
fails
to
impress
me
but
dos
equis
is
a
nice
selection
pairs
naturally
with
mexican
food
tried
it
with
fajitas
spicy
dishes
and
pizza
flavor
of
the
beer
doesnt
compete
with
food
but
instead
refreshes
the
palette
this
is
one
of
the
better
mexican
lagers
definately
a
refreshing
brew
to
pair
with
a
mexican
meal
i
like
this
one
better
then
the
special
it
has
a
good
flavor
for
a
mexican
born
brew
nice
dark
color
and
aroma
from
the
bottle
the
lime
helps
but
is
not
necessary
i
would
order
if
it
was
available
at
a
restaurant
clear
amber
with
a
thin
lacy
head
which
almost
dissapears
malty
aroma
biscuity
and
somewhat
fruity
smelling
flavor
is
not
overly
complex
but
has
a
slightly
sweet
breadlike
flavor
medium
thin
body
with
medium
carbonation
this
is
one
of
the
better
mexican
lagers
and
a
decent
vienna
lager
definately
a
refreshing
brew
to
pair
with
a
mexican
meal
more
starchy
tropical
fruit
smell
here
like
underripe
bananas
mangos
etc
a
hint
of
caramel
appears
what
does
one
say
about
something
so
average
i
could
imagine
a
context
where
this
beer
would
be
welcomed
for
its
simple
warmth
hydrating
qualities
it
is
very
watery
and
lovely
brownish
amber
color
think
of
it
like
industrial
70s
and
80s
music
abba
barry
manilow
hall
and
oats
repetition
would
not
be
kind
a
nice
dark
ambercooper
color
brew
alittle
higher
in
carbonation
makes
the
head
appear
fizzy
with
mediumlow
lace
the
taste
has
some
bite
a
balance
of
more
hop
over
malt
i
agree
it
goes
well
with
mexican
food
i
thought
it
brought
out
the
corn
flavors
very
well
i
was
alittle
scared
of
a
mexican
brew
this
was
given
by
a
friend
and
thankfullyso
ill
get
some
for
such
dinning
notes
one
of
the
better
lagers
to
be
imported
from
mexico
and
a
better
pick
from
massproduced
american
amber
lagers
like
michelob
amber
bock
and
the
like
though
pale
in
compairison
to
some
of
the
more
flavourful
vienna
style
lagers
pairs
well
with
mild
bean
or
chicken
burritos
covered
with
monterey
jack
cheese
pours
a
dark
tea
color
with
a
very
small
head
that
dissipated
rather
quickly
the
smell
and
flavor
is
rather
mild
that
goes
nicely
with
mexican
food
it
is
a
very
smooth
and
very
drinkable
beer
has
a
very
mild
hop
taste
i
liked
this
better
personally
than
its
brother
bohemia
i
could
drink
a
few
of
these
without
that
high
and
dry
feel
that
bohemia
has
salud
that
i
even
had
this
to
be
able
to
post
a
review
is
surprising
went
out
to
a
mexican
food
dinner
and
suzanne
wanted
a
beer
i
was
going
the
water
route
until
she
mentioned
this
anyway
that
this
was
the
obvious
choice
gives
you
an
idea
of
what
was
being
offered
it
arrived
with
a
chilled
miller
light
glass
geez
after
letting
the
glass
thaw
a
bit
i
poured
it
appearance
is
surprisingly
good
and
lacing
was
decent
sweetish
flavor
but
essentially
flavorless
at
the
same
time
not
my
favorite
but
much
better
than
your
average
adjunct
riddled
offering
from
south
of
the
border
bottle
at
cantina
dos
amigos
about
average
on
every
category
poured
dark
ambercopper
to
brown
color
nothing
real
noticable
smell
wise
lots
of
carbonation
bubbles
easy
to
drink
with
mexican
food
some
faint
malt
taste
not
much
very
thin
watery
feel
i
would
have
it
over
a
corona
at
a
mexican
place
okay
this
is
a
beer
that
i
will
have
at
one
of
my
mexican
hangouts
while
i
usually
opt
for
negro
this
is
the
one
i
will
pick
over
corona
it
arrives
as
a
light
copper
color
with
a
good
head
its
hard
to
judge
a
lace
as
it
was
served
quite
cold
a
nice
hops
taste
when
compared
to
other
mexican
beers
of
this
style
light
taste
but
indicative
of
style
i
would
order
this
over
corona
if
you
dont
want
a
negro
style
medium
copperamber
in
color
good
head
and
nice
legs
smells
is
somewhat
grainy
with
a
hint
of
floral
hops
very
drinkable
with
slight
malt
taste
and
smooth
adjunct
mouthfeel
slightly
hoppy
but
not
floral
enough
as
the
man
said
drink
this
with
mexican
foos
lovely
dark
copper
color
with
a
prominent
offwhite
head
that
fades
but
remains
to
the
end
and
a
thick
curtain
of
lace
mild
malt
grain
and
hop
aromas
taste
begins
with
malt
rises
towards
a
pleasant
sweetness
finishes
rather
bitter
and
dry
not
bad
but
best
enjoyed
with
southwestern
cuisine
bronze
in
hue
w
excellent
clarity
the
head
retention
is
poor
and
only
a
thin
ring
of
bubbles
is
left
lots
of
grainy
malt
notes
in
aroma
at
first
but
lightly
toasted
munich
and
sweet
crystal
malt
notes
follow
theres
a
bit
of
grassy
hersbrucker
hop
nose
there
as
well
a
bit
rough
in
aroma
light
and
almost
thin
and
high
in
carbonation
malt
flavors
do
manage
to
assert
themselves
and
are
comprised
of
caramelized
sweetness
from
the
combination
of
crystal
and
munich
and
or
perhaps
a
large
percentage
of
vienna
malt
in
the
grist
flaked
corn
sweetness
is
perceptible
as
well
the
hop
bitterness
is
mild
but
does
provide
an
adequate
foundation
to
the
malt
the
use
of
adjuncts
diminishes
the
malt
backbone
it
finishes
quite
bready
and
grainy
with
a
touch
of
sweetness
hmm
dos
equis
is
a
decent
brew
but
isnt
the
type
to
sip
and
savor
it
really
does
need
to
be
paired
with
food
this
is
in
the
same
league
as
the
rest
of
the
mexican
selections
in
restaurants
a
bit
more
flavor
than
most
i
can
actually
taste
some
malt
in
this
for
mexican
beers
offered
in
restaurants
this
is
one
of
the
better
ones
it
is
best
on
draft
limes
and
salt
are
not
necessary
it
is
decent
but
does
not
have
the
body
or
flavor
that
a
negra
modelo
has
as
with
other
mexican
beers
i
recommend
it
only
within
the
context
of
the
mexican
restaurant
otherwise
there
are
better
beers
to
have
dry
crisp
and
bland
is
almost
every
description
of
mexican
beer
dos
equis
is
no
different
unless
you
are
eating
mexican
food
i
dont
see
how
people
can
enjoy
mexican
beer
a
very
tasty
darker
lager
on
draft
i
have
never
had
it
any
other
way
it
also
isnt
as
watery
as
the
other
mexican
beers
i
have
had
so
thats
a
big
plus
anyhoo
this
was
a
decent
lager
nice
malt
taste
that
youll
miss
with
lime
and
frosted
glass
so
as
i
noted
above
dont
let
them
serve
it
this
way
good
compliment
to
mesquite
steak
and
enchiladas
i
love
the
fact
that
due
to
maxamillians
connection
to
austria
that
mexico
does
a
vienna
lager
history
buff
here
this
is
a
very
drinkable
nonagressive
malty
brew
so
one
need
not
wash
down
mexican
food
with
corona
up
here
in
minnesota
schells
does
a
ton
of
coldfermented
styles
including
a
great
fire
brick
vienna
lager
dos
equis
cant
match
the
bricks
subtle
notes
pours
a
crystal
clear
amber
color
with
a
decent
white
colored
head
on
the
nose
the
aroma
is
of
light
malt
and
mild
hoppiness
the
same
story
on
the
palate
a
crisp
bitterness
in
the
flavor
some
what
dry
overall
a
decent
vienna
styled
lager
but
nothing
to
get
excited
about
i
had
one
of
these
last
night
at
the
local
mexicancreole
joint
a
barely
above
average
lager
but
somehow
it
goes
nicely
with
enchiladas
if
forced
to
drink
mexican
beer
this
will
do
my
favorite
mexican
beer
cools
down
spicey
food
without
giving
in
like
light
beers
its
what
i
order
when
eating
mexican
food
in
fact
i
once
ordered
one
without
eating
and
i
was
not
impressed
a
decent
amber
lager
better
than
some
but
mostly
just
an
average
beer
nice
substantial
body
without
being
heavy
great
choice
with
any
mexican
dish
and
is
probably
better
with
food
than
alone
my
favorite
mexican
beer
i
wish
the
world
would
consider
this
as
the
beer
from
mexico
and
not
corona
one
of
the
best
mexican
beers
ive
had
incredibly
smooth
one
of
my
favorite
dark
mexican
beers
easy
to
drink
great
flavor
and
feel
and
something
i
search
out
now
when
im
buying
beer
in
mexico
mexico
overall
this
beer
is
just
alright
highly
forgettable
the
thing
that
gets
me
about
this
beer
is
the
pretentious
bottle
wrapped
in
foil
as
if
this
is
a
really
rare
treat
id
not
be
opposed
to
having
it
again
but
its
just
too
blah
for
me
to
warrant
ever
buying
it
overall
this
is
a
tasty
and
drinkable
lager
and
while
it
may
not
be
quite
stylistically
accurate
i
quite
like
it
would
definitely
have
again
a
quick
observation
i
have
been
told
by
a
friend
that
bohemia
uses
artificial
colors
and
additives
in
it
brewing
process
and
that
it
will
give
you
rather
nasty
hangover
though
i
can
advocate
the
former
to
be
false
nor
true
i
can
say
that
i
have
yet
to
experience
any
kind
of
hangover
from
bohemia
obscura
even
at
times
drinking
more
than
a
dozen
in
one
evening
overall
interesting
but
not
great
some
decent
malts
but
skunked
bad
lager
overall
a
good
beer
among
all
of
the
popular
mexican
beers
out
there
one
of
the
best
but
not
for
much
its
great
for
a
dry
and
hot
weather
like
those
in
a
typical
mexican
summer
highly
recommended
if
you
come
to
mexico
and
want
to
taste
something
different
and
better
than
corona
a
pretty
good
beer
all
things
considered
so
far
its
the
best
of
the
local
options
ive
had
ill
continue
exploring
other
mexican
beers
but
i
suspect
ill
come
back
to
this
one
hints
of
hazelnut
and
coffee
save
this
from
being
really
bad
but
its
not
far
off
fortunately
its
not
cloyingly
sweet
like
some
other
cuauhtemoc
brews
overall
not
a
very
perplexing
beer
to
taste
but
still
interesting
and
good
pleasant
appearance
but
unfortunately
a
brutal
corn
syrupy
aroma
the
higher
alcohol
content
as
compared
to
most
mexican
beers
deepens
the
flavour
profile
which
has
some
maltiness
along
with
the
fundamental
sweetness
and
overriding
corn
adjuncts
what
a
shame
hops
dont
seem
to
have
made
it
south
of
the
border
however
there
is
an
underlying
slight
bitterness
to
the
finish
so
this
beer
is
actually
growing
on
me
as
i
finish
it
a
tasty
beer
best
consumed
from
the
bottle
or
a
glass
where
the
aroma
does
not
pool
again
drinks
well
both
mouthfeel
and
drinkability
are
nice
and
will
have
a
few
more
in
the
next
few
days
md
goes
down
very
smooth
extremely
drinkable
more
complex
than
most
mexican
beers
probably
my
favorite
but
a
little
harder
to
find
in
stores
than
most
in
mexico
if
it
is
available
its
what
i
am
drinking
d
very
drinkable
as
all
are
when
temps
are
over
100
f
lol
d
as
a
macro
drinkability
is
high
this
is
a
little
bit
more
expensive
than
most
of
mexican
macro
beers
and
could
be
the
best
of
them
very
good
to
pair
with
spicy
mexican
food
its
decent
but
nothing
i
drink
in
the
us
and
while
on
vacation
probably
wouldnt
drink
this
in
the
hot
sun
either
perfect
choice
screw
overpriced
coronas
at
the
mexican
shores
get
a
6
pack
from
the
local
wal
mart
for
60
mxn
you
save
money
and
get
6
delicious
beers
this
beats
easily
most
other
cuahtemoc
beers
and
modelo
beers
remember
this
is
not
the
regular
bohemia
this
one
is
bohemia
oscura
and
has
a
silver
seal
on
top
instead
of
gold
very
recommended
d
is
true
that
is
uncomparable
tastes
of
smooth
malts
with
nutty
caramel
and
lingering
coffee
undertones
feel
is
quite
nice
the
light
coffee
sticks
around
in
the
finish
and
is
met
with
some
malts
for
a
balanced
close
not
very
sweet
and
light
on
the
tongue
with
just
the
right
amount
of
carbonation
easy
drinking
dark
and
reasonably
complex
yet
smooth
making
it
well
suited
for
the
typical
weather
of
its
homeland
sometimes
it
is
creamy
somwtimes
it
is
quite
alcoholic
but
it
has
softer
aroma
than
the
regular
it
broke
the
myth
of
bohemia
being
a
dark
one
it
is
malty
in
tste
and
i
prefeer
it
over
the
other
one
the
quality
is
good
but
not
exceptional
let
us
say
it
is
a
potable
beer

here

recommended

a

well
crafted
version
of
the
style
unfortunately
i
have
to
review
this
from
memory
but
based
on
what
ive
got
stored
in
my
brain
this
was
a
good
beer
it
was
malty
but
not
strong
and
it
was
a
nice
shade
of
red
id
order
it

i
suppose
this
beer
has
a

going
for
it
in
terms
of
feel
appearance
and
even
aroma
but
ultimately
winds
up
a
little
bland
and
muted
for
my
tastes
with
just
a
smidge
more
sweetness
than
id
like
overall
the
malts
in
this
one
are
very
flavorful
i
would
like
a
little
more
out
of
the
hops
however
pouring
a
sample
out
for
the
appearance
looks

a

when

something
for

for

this

disconcerting
longer
finish
was
a
pleasant
remembrance
of

but
overall
this
style
should
be
dry
crisp
and
snappy
and
it
was
over
sugary
and
cheap
tasting
overall
not
bad
nothing
really
wrong
a
bit
on
the
light
side
o
nice

drinkable

lager
always
my
default
choice
at

if
theres
nothing

thats
interesting
which
is
rare
overall
excellent
and
interesting
red
considering
it
was
a
lager
the
mix
of
flavors
of
a
traditional

the

too
a
safe
bet
for
a
nonconnoisseur
friend
who
doesnt
know
which
beer
to
order
i
can
even
imagine
sipping
on
this
one
while
playing
softball
on
a
hot
summer
day
its
medium
bodied
but
all
that
malt
makes
the
lager
drink
a
little
chewy
at
points
it
was
like
to
body
of
the
beer
was
not
consistent
from
start
to
finish
its
an
eminently
drinkable
lager
though
with
an
abv
of
5
it
was
a
good
introduction
to
a
style
that
you
do
not
often
see
dont
drink
and
review
drinkability
another
easy
drinking
beer
from
ih
but
the
style
is
usually
lackluster
in
flavor
overall
not
a
bad
beer
but
not
overwhelming
fuller
bodied
than
expected
with
some
nice
toasted
malt
biscuit
and
subtle
spiciness
nice
crisp

balances
things
out
pretty
nicely
slightly
dry
finish
well
balanced
easy
drinking
session
beer
d
easy
drinkabilty
and
average
enjoyment
gives
this
a
push
to
just
slightly
above
average
status
here
once
again
a
good
lawnmower
beer
or
tweener
but
nothing
to
rush
out
or
enthuse
the
more
demanding
craft
driker
this
came
with
a
good
foamy
finger
of
tawny
head
with
good
retention
the
color
was
a
deep
reddishamber
with
nequality
clarity
the
malt
was
much
more
evident
on
the
nose
than
it
had
been
with
the
light
lager
sweetish
with
a
bready
accent
mouthfeel
was
medium
with
a
red
raspberry
flavor
on
the
tongue
i
was
put
in
mind
of
jello
i
do
not
know
if
that
is
good
or
bad
but
i
liked
it
i
also
liked
the
biscuity
finish
this
was
head
and
shoulders
over
the
light
lager
but
they
were
both
very
light
for
my
taste
drinkability
a
tasty
brew
one
of
my
favorite
for
the
evening
given
the
selection
i
sampled
it
was
drinkable
but
average
tor
a
lager
an
ok
beer
but
nothing
great
poured
a
clear
amber
with
some
red
hues
but
not
as
red
as
i
was
expecting
it
to
be
little
head
but
good
lacing
smells
of
biscuits
and
grassy
hops
taste
is
very
similar
sweet
biscuity
malt
up
front
followed
by
a
dry
grassy
and
floral
hop
finish
medium
in
body
with
good
carbonation
good
for
a
staple
beer
with
nice
hop
flavors
very
sessionable
d
this
beer
reminds
me
a
lot
of
yuengling
lager
without
the
graininess
a
little
sweeter
than
i
would
like
for
a
go
to
session
this
beer
appeared
a
clear
amber
color
in
my
glass
there
were
may
be
a
few
hint
of
red
in
the
color
but
if
they
were
going
for
a
traditional
red
color
they
missed
the
mark
the
aroma
was
intially
hoppy
then
had
hints
of
berries
which
i
thought
was
neat
the
flavor
is
pretty
malty
but
generally
it
had
a
clean
lager
body
with
hint
of
caramelized
sugars
the
beer
was
a
little
flat
in
my
glass
which
made
it
a
little
less
drinkable
but
i
wouldnt
say
this
was
the
case
everytime
its
served
for
the
most
part
this
beer
is
just
a
really
malty
lager
d
a
fine
vienna
just
not
my
favorite
style
and
lacks
some
german
malt
character
i
would
try
this
one
again
since
it
is
quaffable
and
perfect
for
sessioning
very
solid
lager
slightly
reddish
tint
nice
head
strong
hop
aromas
taste
was
balanced
but
surprisingly
dominated
by
a
strong
crisp
hop
presence
slightly
bready
maltnot
too
sweet
but
it
lends
the
brew
a
lot
of
weight
slightly
thick
wih
moderate
carbonation
very
refreshing
great
session
brew
with
a
moderate
abv
appeared
a
nice
copper
color
with
a
thin
lasting
head
and
very
little
carbonation
noted
in
the
beer
produced
light
lacing
as
well
aromas
of
bready
malt
all
the
way
this
followed
through
in
the
flavor
which
was
an
airy
bready
malt
with
slight
roasted
quality
as
well
a
little
sweet
too
mouthfeel
was
nice
and
full
but
not
overbearing
this
was
a
perfect
summer
beer
consequently
i
think
ill
have
some
more
a
clear
deep
amber
body
is
capped
by
a
short
offwhite
head
that
holds
ok
before
dropping
to
a
thin
creamy
collar
and
leaving
some
spotty
lace
the
nose
is
gently
malty
and
a
touch
toasty
there
is
a
very
minimal
fruitiness
to
it
but
you
have
to
look
to
find
it
the
body
is
medium
and
its
lightly
crisp
in
the
mouth
the
flavor
displays
the
juicy
malt
that
vienna
style
lagers
are
known
for
its
lightly
fruity
red
berries
and
toasty
the
bitterness
is
restrained
as
expected
but
firm
enough
to
balance
and
it
finishes
dry
with
some
lingering
toasty
malt
and
fruit
very
well
done
very
clean
a
highly
enjoyable
lager
that
satisfies
it
offers
enough
full
flavor
and
complexity
to
maintain
interest
while
still
remaining
quite
drinkable
its
worth
trying
and
since
the
food
and
atmosphere
are
so
good
its
definitely
worth
making
a
trip
overall
average
there
are
plenty
of
other
lagers
i
would
drink
out
of
a
bottle
this
beer
was
a
clear
copper
color
with
two
fingers
of
head
that
quickly
faded
the
aroma
was
of
caramel
malt
and
nuts
the
flavors
were
of
caramel
malt
sweet
malt
and
a
bit
of
nuts
it
was
very
simple
and
though
not
bad
it
wasnt
much
to
talk
about
the
mouthfeel
was
average
the
body
medium
and
the
carbonation
a
bit
high
d
decent
drinker
but
a
tad
sweet
to
have
more
than
12
a
nice
unoffensive
brew
got
as
a
6pack
mixer
there
is
a
pretty
smooth
finish
with
some
mildly
assertive
carbonation
it
was
another
decent
brew
from
wagner
valley
from
whom
ive
never
had
a
dud
yet
good
job
d
very
drinkable
seems
to
be
a
solid
amber
lager
but
im
not
sure
id
go
out
of
my
way
to
have
it
again
overall
id
say
its
a
pretty
decent
beer
at
first
the
initial
sweetness
was
offputting
to
me
when
ive
taken
the
time
to
enjoy
it
i
actually
like
the
balance
of
flavors
the
sixpack
i
picked
up
will
come
in
handy
as
a
nice
refreshment
for
a
summer
day
a
straightforward
malty
easy
drinking
vienna
lager
i
like
this
beer
i
tried
it
for
the
first
time
on
tap
at
the
brewhouse
and
got
a
mix
a
six
pack
with
two
of
these
i
must
say
i
liked
it
better
on
the
tap
but
this
was
still
pretty
decent
poured
into
a
sam
adams
perfect
pint
glass
it
pours
a
nice
hearty
amber
color
with
excellent
clarity
it
has
a
nice
frothy
foamy
head
that
initially
looks
great
but
the
beer
provides
no
lacing
or
glass
retention
at
all
id
probably
give
it
another
full
point
on
the
appearance
scale
if
that
was
the
case
plus
it
clears
up
completely
in
maybe
2
minutes
the
smell
is
pretty
good
too
very
malty
smells
caramelized
and
toasted
the
taste
is
much
like
the
smell
generously
malty
and
great
on
a
cold
night
the
taste
is
initially
sweet
roasted
and
caramelized
malts
theres
an
additional
sweetness
that
i
cant
quite
put
my
finger
on
maybe
like
a
brown
sugar
or
some
type
of
brown
sugar
extract
pretty
nice
and
well
balanced
though
let
this
beer
warm
up
a
little
if
its
in
the
refrigerator
or
dont
refrigerate
it
at
all
the
flavor
is
dulled
quite
a
bit
when
cooled
off
more
so
than
other
beers
ive
tried
i
really
cant
taste
the
hops
but
there
is
a
bitter
feel
at
the
end
so
its
clearly
noticeable
as
an
ingredient
the
mouthfeel
is
good
pretty
full
bodied
and
smooth
a
very
drinkable
beer
i
gotta
say
i
was
really
in
the
mood
for
a
malty
beer
when
i
drank
this
so
go
for
it
if
youre
in
the
mood
for
a
nice
malty
lager
but
at
the
same
token
avoid
it
at
all
cost
when
youre
looking
for
something

the

not

this
beer
pours
a
pretty
amber
color
with
a
tall
white
head
that
recedes
to
lace
the
aroma
presents
some
light
sweet
malt
and
just
a
touch
of
those
bottom
feeders
the
taste
once
again
is
just
a
bit
of
light
sweet
malt
at
the
start
the
odd
citrus
hop
selection
and
the
dry
lager
finish
the
light
body
and
aggressive
carbonation
make
this
a
pretty
easy
drinker
but
not
nearly
as
good
as
the
oatmeal
stout
i
was
expecting
a
little
more
from
this
beer
and
it
just
turned
out
weird
and
offsetting
this
was
the
first
of
a
mixed
six
pack
i
got
as
a
gift
from
this
brewery
so
im
hoping
the
rest
are
a
little
better

a

i
would
hope
would

whats
there
nips
at

too
sweet
too
tangy
pass
drinkability
soso
as
this
is
a
bit
thin
low
alcohol
gives
this
a
bit
higher
nod
but
overall
this
is
a
bit
dull
its
a
shame
because
wagner
does
some
awesome
brews
especially
the
sled
dog
and
maybe
i
got
a
bad
batch
but
overall
im
not
going
with
this
one
again
d
his
is
a
pretty
easy
to
drink
beer
good
taste
and
is
smooth
could
session
this
beer
anyway
without
doing
a
horizontal
tasting
it
seems
to
be
right
along
the
lines
of
the
sled
dog
just
on
the
lighter
side
and
thats
fine
im
sure
i
be
drinking
more

i

it
it

beer
great

it
other
characteristics
are
average
for
the
most

it
is
the
sort
of
beer
you
will
drink
five
of
before
realize
it
decidedly
brown
in
colour
with
a
medium
amount
of
carbonation
its
got
a
nutty
malty
aroma
with
little
hop
influance
the
caramel
malt
is
the
dominant
flavor
along
with
some
minor
notes
of
vienna
and
munich
malts
and
some
clean
bitterness
still
its
a
little
too
cloying
to
have
more
than
one
of
these
its
fairly
average
stuff

the

lager
it

strange

but
its
growing
on

it
has
a

of
an
unsavory
metal
flavor
i
want
to
love
these
guys
i
really
do
anyone
who
both
brews
beer
and
wine
is
worthy
of
everyones
respect
i
wish
i
have
had
a
good
beer
from
them
when
i
was
there
the
other
day
i
bought
a
sixer
of
everything
they
had
this
was
your
perfectly
average
lager
amber
in
colour
it
was
a
moderate
head
the
smell
was
light
all
around
mild
hops
and
mild
malts
a
little
caramel
the
taste
was
exactly
the
same
i
dont
know
its
just
your
middle
of
the
road
lager
12
oz
bottle
yes
it
is
amber
in
color
just
like
the
name
it
pours
pretty
clear
with
a
little
head
the
aroma
is
malty
sweet
with
some
caramel
the
taste
contains
some
roastiness
to
balance
the
sweetness
some
hops
there
in
the
background
not
too
bad
it
gets
better
with
each
sip
where
is
the
malt
flavor
a
mediocre
vienna
lager
ive
tried
many
amber
lagers
in
my
day
but
none
quite
like
this
one
there
was
so
much
carbonation
that
blindfolded
i
might
have
thought
i
was
drinking
some
strange
type
of
soda
pop
while
the
beer
didnt
gush
out
of
the
bottle
it
poured
mostly
foam
into
the
glass
the
bottle
says
its
a
vienna
style
lager
but
to
me
it
gave
off
an
unpleasant
taste
of
sweet
caramel
very
raw
and
unbalanced
as
if
the
product
was
bottled
before
its
time
im
amazed
it
could
have
passed
any
quality
control
test
before
leaving
the
brewery
no
question
the
beer
was
fresh
too
fresh
im
afraid
unfortunately
i
bought
a
6pack
as
ive
had
several
other
wagner
valley
products
particularly
the
sled
dog
dopplebock
which
impressed
me
guess
their
quality
isnt
consistent
from
product
to
product
a
pleasing
if
somewhat
raw
beer
i
had
no
problems
with
gushing
or
overcarbonation

very
attractive

nose
fruity

strong
hints

and
brown
sugar
beer
is
not
as
sweet
as
all
that
although
the
caramel
underbelly
is
certainly
sugary
and
tasty
bitter
piney
hops
and
musty
fruity
yeast
do
a
nice
job
of
evening
out
the
woody
flavor
an
enjoyable
beer
although
novices
may
be
put
off
by
the
strong
unrefined
flavor
not
me
amber
lagers
are
versatile
with
many
different
foods
but
why
not
try
this
in
the
morning
alongside
a
tall
stack
of
flapjacks
the
taste
is
by
far
its
strong
point
with
a
mild
malt
background
and
a
slight
hint
of
caramel
full
bodied
and
impressive
once
you
get
by
its
heady
weakness
thanks
to
davo
for
the
sample
for
a
vienna
style
this
had
a
rather
faint
roasted
malt
with
a
rather
odd
smokey
aspect
perhaps
it
is
the
yeast
strain
being
used
here
but
the
beer
had
an
off
flavor
that
threw
the
beer
out
of
balance
not
bad
but
i
do
not
find
myself
wanting
another
a
solid
offering
in
what
generally
is
a
rather
uninspried
catagory
imho
this
has
some
similarities
to
sa
boston
lager
but
kicked
up
a
notch
or
two
the
malts
are
balanced
nicely
with
spicey
hallertau
and
tettnang
finishes
clean
and
beckons
you
drink
more
overall
nothing
to
write
home
about
just
another
basic
adjunct
lager
that
is
interchangeable
with
so
many
other
beers
in
its
style

about
a
c
this

rather
than
a

i
would
wedge

between

two
groups
a
little
better
than
the
cheap
stuff
but
not
any
better
than
your
typical

purchase

you

this
is

im
going
to
call
it

all
around
but
im
enjoying
it
overall
its
pretty
good
nice
lawnmower
beer
that
is
inexpensive
drinkability
is
okay
i
suppose
its
not
aiming
very
high
to
begin
with
but
still
not
interesting
or
enjoyable
mouthfeel
is
light
bodied
with
medium
to
high
carbonation
a
huge
mess
i
would
avoid
thanks
russ
drinkability
from
a
beer
perspective
this
beer
does
not
have
a
lot
to
offer
would
i
drink
it
again
ya
i
could
see
myself
drinking
if
i
wanted
a
fresh
light
tasting
beer
but
i
would
not
stock
these
on
a
day
to
day
basis
pours
a
clear
pale
orange
colour
with
white
head
that
dissipates
quickly
but
some
lacing
around
the
glass
smells
of
bready
malt
with
some
very
faint
grassy
hops
not
much
in
the
way
of
flavour
but
nothing
off
about
it
is
there
actually
adjuncts
in
here
ok
carbonation
level
and
easy
to
drink
d
this
beer
was
just
alright
nothing
fantastic
here
but
it
would
do
quite
nicely
on
a
very
hot
summer
day
mouthfeel
is
medium
pretty
smooth
but
ultimately
the
beer
does
have
quite
a
sweetness
to
it
and
ends
up
hurting
the
drinkability
i
have
no
problem
with
sweetness
in
something
like
a
barleywine
or
ris
because
it
has
depth
but
this
is
just
grainy
sweetness
d
fairly
high
if
i
wanted
a
really
really
easy
drinking
ontario
lager
with
just
barely
enough
flavour
for
an
evening
of
drinkingthis
would
have
to
be
it
the
4
5
abv
is
also
swell
as
far
as
a
discount
brew
goes
you
can
do
much
worse
at
around
30
bucks
for
a
24
its
not
a
bad
brew
cant
say
i
really
enjoyed
it
that
much
its
not
among
wellingtons
best
offerings
d
a
drain
pour
for
me
and
yet
another
clunker
in
the
wellington
lineup
they
still
make
some
good
beers
but
trailhead
isnt
one
of
them
dont
bother
d
its
drinkable
but
only
because
its
plain
and
bland
it
could
definitely
use
more
hops
theres
nothing
redeeming
about
this
macro
wannabe
a
fair
shake
better
than
your
typical
aa
heh
lager
classificationwise
but
it
doesnt
quite
follow
through
on
the
packagings
promise
of
a
vienna
lager
by
dint
of
czech
hops
and
german
malts
the
requisite
crispness
and
zing
just
arent
there
overall
verdict
wellington
should
stick
to
english
ales
this
isnt
a
bad
beer
by
any
means
its
just
a
really
boring
one
not
bad
for
a
canadian
lager
not
the
worst
aal
ive
tried
but
really
that
far
ahead
in
the
taste
dept
from
old
milwaukee
either
pretty
average
lager
all
around
and
not
the
best
i
have
had
from
the
brewery
but
a
decent
beer
nonetheless
head
is
foamy
and
white
medium
sized
body
is
a
dark
amber
colour
aroma
is
stale
hops
corn
and
a
faint
sweetness
taste
is
hoppy
bitter
sweet
like
sugar
and
slight
corn
finish
is
a
tad
watery
leaving
a
mild
bite
in
the
throat
as
well
not
horrid
but
they
make
better
stuff
mouthfeel
smooth
and
watery
final
thoughts
well
i
knew
this
beer
was
one
of
wellingtons
weaker
offerings
but
even
still
it
has
its
niche
this
would
be
a
great
after
a
long
hike
in
the
woods
which
is
really
what
this
beer
sorta
implies
by
its
name
its
not
bad
for
an
adjunct
lager
but
when
you
pour
it
into
the
glass
the
lackluster
smell
and
appearance
doesnt
do
it
any
favors
during
the
review
drinkability
for
me
this
will
be
the
first
and
last
time
for
trailhead
premium
lager
not
a
good
product
not
a
good
beer
this
has
potential
for
sure
just
round
out
the
carbonation
a
bit
and
we
have
a
winner
here
otherwise
a
great
malty
lager
pours
clear
golden
yellow
with
moderate
white
head
which
dissapeared
quickly
smell
malts
mostly
average
smell
for
this
type
of
beer
taste
sweet
malts
corn
not
too
bad
actually
at
least
id
doesnt
taste
like
medicine
like
other
brews
of
this
kind
feels
a
bit
flat
but
stil
ok
with
clean
finish
its
pretty
drinkable
this
is
not
something
id
drink
on
a
regular
basis
but
still
an
ok
beer
easy
enough
to
drink
but
it
really
lacks
in
substance
could
work
for
a
lawnmower
beer
not
terrible
but
not
worth
what
i
paid
for
it
why
couldnt
they
have
found
an
extra
case
of
arkell
in
the
storeroom
honestly
i
expected
a
bit
better
than
this
from
wellington
but
for
what
it
is
its
not
terrible
worth
a
try
at
least
i
was
expecting
something
a
bit
better
from
wellington
brewery
this
seems
more
along
the
lines
of
the
discount
buckabeer
brews
perhaps
thats
what
its
meant
to
be
anyways

and
watery
sort
of
a
meh
beer
decent
for
camping
but
their
are
much
better
session
beers
but
coming
from
wellington
i
would
expect
much
better
d
overall
a
clean
light
watery
brew
a
good
choice
for
people
who
dont
like
beer
any
way
this
beer
is
like
that
it
tastes
alright
but
just
isnt
anything
memorable
so
i
wont
try
it
again
straw
colour
witha
half
finger
white
head
that
spread
out
soon
enough
with
minimal
lacing
a
mix
of
large
and
small
bubble
carbonation
smells
of
fresh
grass
mild
citrus
taste
is
citrus
hoppy
dry
bitter
malt
slightly
sour
finish
light
to
medium
body
not
a
bad
lager
overall
but
not
a
great
one
by
any
stretch
this
might
appeal
to
the
scores
of
lager
lovers
who
dont
want
to
spend
too
much
its
certainly
better
than
many
of
the
macro
lagers
that
have
unfortunately
cornered
a
certain
market
here
in
ontario
from
wellington
county
an
honest
effort
at
compromise
better
than
most
theyre
competing
with
on
this
level
a
very
lackluster
beer
but
still
a
notch
up
from
bmc
overall
for
the
price
of
this
beer
you
cant
go
wrong
you
pay
for
what
you
get
and
in
trailhead
lagers
case
that
is
an
above
average
brew
at
a
great
price
its
hard
to
find
cheaper
beers
that
are
of
decent
quality
but
wellington
brewery
makes
a
pitch
into
the
buckabeer
market
and
for
once
we
see
a
brewery
make
a
decentdrinkable
natural
beer
thats
better
than
youre
basic
macros
at
an
unbeatable
price
give
this
brew
a
shot
it
may
not
be
the
best
beer
out
there
but
it
sure
is
one
of
the
best
discount
beers
fortunately
theres
enough
good
beer
out
there
that
none
of
us
should
ever
have
to
settle
for
something
thats
just
agreeable
trailhead
was
obviously
designed
for
those
with
low
standards
and
while
not
the
bottom
of
the
barrel
for
beers
in
this
style
and
price
range
i
personally
would
have
to
feel
pretty
down
on
myself
to
sit
through
another
pint
of
it
d
a
good
sessionable
beer
but
the
hop
profile
isnt
my
style
taste
is
a
little
more
muddled
with
an
unpleasant
acidity
that
sets
off
what
is
otherwise
a
pretty
tasty
beer
theres
a
slight
citrus
and
grassy
hop
presence
along
with
a
punchy
malt
backbone
but
something
in
the
finish
says
cheap
a
shame
really
because
otherwise
this
is
a
very
refreshing
lager
a
bit
overcarbonated
perhaps
but
fullbodied
a
decent
offering
and
certainly
drinkable
but
not
the
holy
grail
of
lagers
either
this
is
definitely
a
good
summer
brew
when
the
budget
is
low
but
the
heat
is
high
this
is
a
brew
that
fits
the
bill
a
thirst
quencher
that
i
wouldnt
think
too
much
about
but
would
certainly
enjoy
in
a
pint
glass
or
even
straight
from
the
bottle
trailhead
is
in
all
likelihood
the
best
lager
youll
find
on
the
discount
board
at
the
beer
store
so
bottoms
up
very
clear
golden
colour
topped
with
a
thin
sheet
of
fine
bubbles
fair
retention
and
a
bit
of
lacing
smells
of
maltcorn
sweetness
with
a
bit
of
fruit
and
mild
spicy
hops
the
flavour
is
a
bit
fruity
the
bitterness
quite
mild
and
it
has
a
slightly
acidic
sharpness
at
the
end
very
light
hop
flavour
thats
on
the
spicy
side
it
finishes
offdry
sweetness
is
pronounced
throughout
and
its
too
much
for
the
beer
to
handle
the
body
is
light
but
not
to
the
point
of
being
watery
easy
to
drink
nothing
special
but
worth
a
try

i

taste
is
a

mix

with
some

this
one
lacks
character
overall
and
is
probably
not
the

beer
from
this
brewery

its

possibly
on

day
but
otherwise
this
beer
is
average
at
its
best
the
taste
is
a
little
sweet
but
the
hops
are
also
evident
in
a
twangiesp
aftertaste
that
also
leaves
you
dry
and
wanting
more
worth
a
try
overall
the
malts
in
this
brew
are
definitely
a
stand
out
would
like
to
have
had
just
a
little
more
hops
to
add
a
little
more
balance
otherwise
a
tasty
vienna
lager
the
beer
poured
a
clear
amber
with
a
big
head
that
didnt
last
long
the
nose
is
some
light
breadiness
the
taste
starts
with
some
slightly
piney
hops
with
just
a
little
bit
of
sweetness
to
offset
it
the
hop
oils
linger
on
the
palate
and
make
for
a
bit
of
a
cloying
aftertaste
the
alcohol
is
present
as
well
giving
it
a
little
bit
of
warming
the
mouthfeel
is
slightly
carbonated
with
a
little
thickness
not
a
bad
beer
by
any
means
it
just
doesnt
bring
a
ton
to
the
table
and
feels
a
little
offbalanced
o
just
above
average
for
a
lager
and
its
good
enough
to
easily

nothing

special
here
overall
ive
only
tried
a
few
vienna
lagers
but
kings
vienna
lager
is
by
far
the
best
ive
tried
so
far
solid
all
around
beer
and
im
glad
i
have
5
more
in
my
fridge
o
a
great
go
to
beer
full
of
hints
of
caramel
bread
and
bitterness
not
a
bad
everyday
drink
has
a
good
flavour
to
it
caramel
malts
dominate
and
beer
has
a
good
texture
and
flavour
profile
only
improvement
would
be
to
have
the
caramel
slightly
less
cloyingsweet
id
still
recommend
it
very
sessionable
and
a
good
profile
of
the
style
drinkability
its
a
very
smooth
drinkable
beer
accompanied
with
decent
flavors
and
aromas
very
refreshing
final
thoughts
if
you
want
a
beer
to
teach
you
macro
buddies
on
what
beer
should
be
try
them
on
this
it
has
a
high
drinkability
but
a
rich
malty
flavour
that
should
win
people
over
the
generic
straw
taste
of
so
many
lagers
i
really
have
to
try
more
of
kings
offerings
because
this
was
great
this
is
a
style
i
tend
to
overlook
as
there
just
arent
very
many
quality
ones
available
around
here
not
being
an
expert
in
vienna
lagers
perhaps
the
only
useful
information
i
can
offer
is
this
its
a
better
choice
than
dos
equis
amber
definitely
worth
a
try
and
something
ill
probably
pick
up
again
some
time
o
i
cant
say
that
im
overly
familiar
with
the
style
but
i
can
certainly
say
this
was
a
nonoffensive
flavourful
and
easy
drinking
offering
worth
a
try
and
i
would
certainly
down
a
6er
of
this
no
problem
having
experienced
very
few
examples
of
the
style
all
i
can
say
is
that
this
does
a
fair
job
of
hitting
the
majority
of
the
academic
laundry
list
of
points
and
is
enjoyable
enough
to
have
more
than
a
few
in

to
conveniently

competently
made
drinks
nice
worth
a
try
a
beer
of
this
sort
is
fit
for
a
wide
range
beer
drinking
experiences
it
will
certainly
shine
on
its
own
with
great
company
but
will
also
be
a
wonderful
pairing
with
soft
cheeses
turkey
grilled
or
roasted
chicken
vinaigrette
salads
light
deserts
spice
and
hearty
fare
as
well
as
classic
pub
food
my
personal
favorite
is
fish
and
chips
canadas
king
vienna
lager
would
take
backseat
to
no
authentic
european
offering
it
demonstrates
every
bit
the
quality
and
craftsmanship
of
those
original
oldworld
brands
and
its
engineered
for
germanlevels
of
consumption
too
a
six
pack
of
this
stuff
will
not
last
long
another
good
king
rendition
of
a
germanic
classic
overall
its
alright
actually
a
well
done
lager
that
is
a
bit
average
but
overall
worthy
of
attention
though
not
as
grand
as
their
pilsner
kings
vienna
lager
is
a
decent
serviceable
brew
that
would
make
for
a
fine
patiobbq
sixer
to
bring
along
a
bit
more
assertiveness
and
more
body
would
have
made
this
a
stellar
brew
compare
with
great
lakes
eliot
ness
overall
i
think
this
is
a
good
example
of
the
traditional
vienna
lager
beer
style
not
my
own
personal
favourite
but
would
recommend
to
anyone
who
enjoys
that
style
m
light
body
with
moderate
carbonation
another
solid
entry
from
king
brewery
i
dont
like
it
as
much
as
their
pilsner
but
this
is
a
really
accessible
easydrinking
beer
that
will
likely
find
its
way
into
my
regular
rotation
for
dinner
parties
overall
a
fairly
text
book
example
of
the
style
that
aims
for
greatness
but
falls
just
short
for
me
i
wish
it
had
a
little
more
oomph
and
body
its
incredibly
drinkable
though
pours

with
hints
of
orange

and
another

from

i
could
revisit
and
hope
this
will
see
bottle
distribution
at
some
point
on

at
beer
bistro

a

bready

has
a
small
amount
of
refreshing

but
the
sweetness
comes
through

was
good
this
was
a
good
beer
to
start
off
a
warm
sunday
afternoon
ive
been
impressed
with
everything
ive
tried
from
king
on
tap
at
beer
bistro
slightly
reddish
tinge
body
with
some
lace
great
malt
aroma
dryish
lager
balanced
and
easy
drinking
a
tad
sweet
bang
on
for
the
styleas
this
brewery
accomplishes
consistently
and
likely
my
more
or
less
average
rating
for
this
pleasant
style
over
the
years
satisfying
quenching
yet
flavorful
with
a
decent
malt
discernment
and
hop
bite
this
is
a
keeper
hope
its
not
just
a
one
off
this
beer
is
way
better
on
draft
then
in
a
bottle
hard
to
find
down
south
so
that
probably
causes
me
to
rate
it
higher
than
some
not
a
true
micro
or
artisan
beer
but
a
decent
attempt
by
a
large
brewery
to
appeal
to
a
different
taste
a
pretty
solid
but
basic
red
from
leinenkugels
overall
its
ok
not
sure
wed
have
it
again
here
i
am
at
the
milwaukee
airport
thinking
yeah
leinies
red
been
there
done
that
turns
out
that
no
i
have
never
reviewed
this
beer
and
here
i
am
having
it
on
tap
in
its
home
state
pours
out
to
nice
head
that
falls
down
and
pale
reddish
amber
hue
aroma
is
mild
sweet
malt
and
grassy
hops
flavors
is
balanced
and
refreshing
although
a
bit
weak
mouthfeel
is
light
overall
a
decent
quaff
when
burned
out
on
hop
bombs
chill
it
cold
and
enjoy
not
your
average
lager
as
it
has
a
bit
of
a
malt
backbone
with
a
hop
tingle
at
the
end
nice
ruby
red
color
try
it
as
cold
as
you
can
to
start
im
going
to
say
that
i
love
leinenkugel
beer
all
of
them
whether
its
creamy
dark
or
summer
shandy
there
isnt
much
wrong
i
can
find
wrong
with
them
leinenkugel
red
is
no
exception
my
only
complaint
is
that
i
wish
it
had
a
little
more
head
when
poured
this
beer
is
refreshing
and
its
aroma
and
taste
are
superb
if
you
are
a
fan
of
reds
try
this
out
of
course
it
poured
out
well
with
a
halfinch
cream
head
and
a
rubyorange
color
this
beers
taste
is
well
balanced
with
no
one
characteristic
that
shines
through
thats
why
its
such
a
great
beer
extremely
drinkable
but
hey
im
biased
here
what
can
i
say
this
pours
a
reddish
copper
color
with
a
decent
fluffy
head
the
aroma
is
slightly
malty
with
a
slight
bit
of
spices
the
taste
is
fair
with
a
decent
malt
and
spice
flavor
that
you
would
expect
from
a
red
lager
drinks
pretty
decent
with
a
likable
texture
and
flavorful
finish
this
beer
holds
a
special
place
in
my
heart
it
was
my
gateway
beer
to
microbrews
and
craft
beers
back
when
i
was
drinking
mgd
red
dog
icehouse
and
other
ordinary
beers
this
one
was
my
first
chance
taken
on
something
off
the
path
applebees
had
it
on
tap
and
i
watched
a
server
carry
one
by
in
a
brewtus
glass
i
said
to
myself
i
must
have
one
of
those
so
i
did
and
i
enjoyed
it
it
became
sort
of
an
after
work
tradition
and
soon
after
i
tried
warsteiner
and
guinness
and
the
rest
is
history
cant
remember
the
last
time
i
had
an
mgd
do
they
still
make
it
anyway
about
the
beer
smooth
red
nice
beer
that
deserves
to
be
tasted
i
confess
that
i
havent
had
one
in
a
long
time
i
cant
find
it
anymore
around
here
what
happened
to
it
wish
i
could
find
it
i
would
get
a
6
pack
or
two
of
it
if
its
in
your
area
try
it
this
is
one
of
my
facorites
that
i
have
tried
from
leines
thus
far
the
small
was
very
pleasant
while
the
taste
was
even
better
i
was
given
a
bottle
of
this
on
accident
while
at
a
restaurant
i
am
very
happy
about
the
mixup
or
i
would
have
never
tried
this
beer
i
would
recommend
it
to
anyone
looking
for
a
good
red
beer

just
the
right
hops
too
many
craft
beer
snobs
have
to
have
over
hopped
beer
that
leaves
a
horrible
taste
when
you
belch
i
agree
that
the
head
dies
too
soon
otherwise
this
reminds
me
a
bit
of
the
cold
fermented
ales
alt
biers
served
only
in
dusseldorf
clean
taste
good
mouth
great
beer
o
nothing
stands
out
about
this
beer
i
really
wanted
to
rate
it
lower
but
it
really
is
just
an
average
forgettable
beer
o
good
session
beer
thats
about
the
best
thing
to
say
about
it
o
pretty
good
as
someone
else
said
it
could
serve
as
a
gateway
to
other
craft
beers
drinkable
not
too
much
going
on
here
basic
and
plain
actually
has
a
pretty
nice
amber
color
but
after
that
pretty
straight
forward
plain
aromas
of
very
slight
spicy
fruit
and
that
is
being
nice
taste
is
on
the
boring
side
for
me
i
expect
more
from
a
craft
beer
red
pours
a
slightly
dark
golden
color
with
very
small
head
there
wasnt
much
of
an
aroma
at
all
the
taste
was
rather
malty
and
yeasty
no
other
flavors
came
through
rather
light
in
taste
no
hops
whats
so
ever
and
watery
overall
this
isnt
a
horrible
beer
but
their
isnt
much
here
but
it
doesnt
have
a
bad
taste
o
the
smell
and
the
taste
didnt
leap
out
and
grab
me
but
overall
id
say
its
a
refreshing
beer
thatd
be
great
for
rejuvenating
on
a
hot
day
id
drink
it
again
and
ill
likely
buy
some
more
o
slightly
disappointed
with
this
one
comes
off
at
the
start
with
the
biscuit
dryness
and
then
heads
to
bitterness
from
the
hops
and
then
a
dry
alcohol
feeling
not
much
flavor
that
i
thought
id
have
after
smelling
the
nice
aromas
would
like
to
try
on
tap

compare

up
a

a

beer
easy
to

better
than
macro
brews
but
without
a

of
character
this
isnt
a
great
beer
it
may
be
alright
for
someone
working
their
way
into
craft
beer
but
its
definitely
not
a
great
representative
of
the
style
overall
a
tastyenough
and
drinkable
beer
not
a
bad
thirst
quencher
despite
some
flavor
difficulties
d
one
of
the
nicer
leinie
brews
i
have
had
at

recently
looks
good
feels
good
tastes
fair
and
smells
alright
nice
and
easy
drinking
pretty
solid
this
is
a
bitter
beer
and
not
complex
but
the
bitterness
is
not
overpowering
nor
unbalanced
it
compliments
pizza
and
spinach
or
a
pipe
quite
well
but
it
is
not
the
kind
of
beer
i
want
to
drink
on
its
own
translucent
coppery
red
in
color
with
a
return
to
the
usual
fizzy
stubby
head
without
lacing
from
the
majority
of
the
members
of
the
leinenkugel
session
smell
is
very
faint
almost
nonexistent
just
a
ghost
of
a
whisper
of
malt
nuance
tastes
like
a
watery
and
thinbodied
vienna
lager
with
a
lackluster
sprinkling
of
hops
on
top
im
not
particularly
impressed
or
offended
by
this
one
either
middle
of
the
road
watery
and
thin
beer
but
still
better
than
a
bmc
when
i
poured
this
beer
into
a
pint
glass
it
has
a
light
reddish
brown
body
with
a
very
creamysticky
white
head
i
dont
pick
up
much
from
the
smell
but
a
little
malt
the
taste
is
a
little
malty
with
some
hops
on
the
back
of
the
tongue
the
mouth
feel
is
ok
and
overall
i
wasnt
inpressed
at
all
poured
into
a
pint
glass
pours
an
unsurprising
copper
red
with
a
thin
beige
head
on
top
decent
lace
left
behind
the
nose
is
mild
with
slight
hop
scent
but
mostly
sweet
malts
and
breads
good
clean
mouthfeel
crisp
with
decent
carbonation
a
nice
sweet
lager
here
light
toffee
fresh
bread
little
bit
of
graham
cracker
nice
beer
nothing
earthshattering
but
a
beer
i
wouldnt
turn
down
overall
its
okay
i
like
the
hops
but
other
than
that
nothing
special
overall
its
just
ok
it
has
that
leinies
taste
that
every
one
of
their
beers
has
and
i
dont
know
what
it
is
or
how
to
describe
it
but
its
always
there
a
decent
brew
but
nothing
special
nothing
really
special
here
its
a
vienna
lager
but
thats
about
it
seems
muted
and
missing
a
bigger
malty
backbone
o
this
is
an
average
beer
it
is
drinkable
but
i
wouldnt
buy
again
in
favor
of
trying
something
new
o
although
they
are
different
styles
this
was
somewhat
similar
to
the
classic
amber
i
thought
the
red
was
a
little
better
i
actually
think
that
as
far
as
leinies
beers
go
this
is
pretty
good
i
have
found
leinies
at
many
a
family
gathering
because
they
brew
middle
ground
beer
it
doesnt
typically
scare
of
the
macro
light
crowd
and
it
doesnt
completely
disgust
those
with
a
preference
for
craft
d
rather
enjoyable
that
said
id
prefer
a
sam
adams
to
this
had
ontap
at
a
little
place
in
port
clinton
called
bel
mel
tavern
leinenkugel
much
like
sam
adams
are
usually
solid
choices
when
nothing
else
but
macro
is
present
i
find
both
companies
produce
fairly
decent
styles
if
a
little
unremarkable
most
of
the
time
though
i
find
sam
to
be
better
with
their
offerings
then
leiny
but
i
digress
poured
a
nice
amber
red
into
pint
place
which
arrived
with
a
quarter
inch
or
so
of
fluffy
head
taste
was
a
good
mouth
feel
with
a
noble
hop
crispness
that
mellows
to
a
nice
clean
drinking
biscuit
like
finish
i
have
to
say
i
would
get
this
again
probably
my
personal
favorite
that
i
have
had
from
leinenkugels
as
i
actually
found
myself
wanting
another
instead
of
wanting
something
else
with
a
little
more
a
good
solid
vienna
lager
for
sure
o
probably
the
best
ive
had
from
leines
but
thats
not
really
saying
much
a
similar
beer
to
yuengling
but
not
as
dry
worth
a
pickup
if
you
like
the
style
ill
call
this
one
average
even
though
my
ratings
for
appearance
and
smell
will
inflate
the
overall
score
wow
i
cant
remember
the
last
time
a
beer
left
me
so
stricken
for
words
in
the
manner
of
i
just
cant
describe
this
its
so
booorrring
not
bad
not
good
just
well
not
even
meh
cripes
this
is
the
beer
equivalent
of
being
home
by
10
sure
theres
alcohol
in
here
and
i
could
have
downed
a
few
bottles
of
this
if
i
had
nothing
else
to
drink
here
this
is
a
session
beer
but
thats
not
saying
a
whole
lot
when
this
doesnt
have
a
lot
going
for
it
having
a
blue
point
toasted
lager
or
the
vienna
lager
from
trader
joes
would
be
a
wiser
option
than
this
since
they
have
body
and
flavors
to
match
this
may
be
the
darkest
lawnmower
beer
that
ill
have
this
year
my
first
visit
to
red
lobster
seriously
and
my
first
sam
adams
pint
glass
with
a
lobster
on
it
right
on
the
beer
pours
a
rusty
amber
topped
by
nearly
a
finger
of
cream
foam
the
nose
comprises
caramel
stale
rye
bread
and
musty
oranges
the
taste
holds
notes
of
musty
caramel
orange
rind
light
lemon
peel
black
pepper
and
a
pinch
of
nutmeg
things
dont
quite
meld
well
ending
up
with
a
harsh
bitterness
shrouded
by
a
meek
attempt
at
sweetness
the
body
is
a
light
medium
with
a
moderate
carbonation
and
a
fairly
dry
finish
overall
i
was
nowhere
near
enthused
by
this
brew
but
luckily
the
tilapia
dish
that
accompanied
it
salvaged
the
dinner
very
basic
beer
here
subjectively
i
am
enjoying
this
quite
a
bit
and
find
it
to
be
a
great
session
possibility
but
it
lacks
any
distinguishing
characteristics
that
would
allow
me
to
rate
it
higher
solidly
above
average
brew
though
final
notes
yet
another
letdown
from
lenies
i
keep
hopin
they
give
me
something
memorable
but
it
hasnt
happened
yet
i
wont
be
buying
this
again
and
there
are
much
better
vienna
lagers
out
there
snake
river
lager
and
sabl
come
to
mind
my
leinie
lodge
newsletter
arrived
the
other
day
and
it
made
for
a
pleasant
read
the
beer
poured
pleasantly
enough
giving
me
twoplus
fingers
of
thick
tawny
head
that
began
to
fall
like
wile
e
coyote
off
of
a
cliff
i
am
a
big
fan
of
truth
in
advertising
so
a
reddishamber
beer
that
bills
itself
as
a
red
lager
is
right
up
my
alley
actually
it
was
closer
to
copper
and
it
had
nequality
clarity
which
makes
for
a
pretty
beer
if
nothing
else
nose
was
quite
malty
sweet
making
good
use
of
the
four
varieties
mentioned
on
the
label
mouthfeel
was
medium
with
an
initial
sweetness
but
giving
way
to
a
mild
bitterness
especially
on
the
finish
i
shake
my
head
in
disbelief
that
i
did
not
like
this
on
tap
at
one
point
but
the
circumstances
are
lost
i
know
that
it
was
quite
enjoyable
this
evening
and
if
i
could
get
it
in
a
can
i
would
be
up
for
a
try
the
red
lager
pours
out
as
an
mildly
attractive
amber
color
much
like
any
of
the
red
lagers
out
there
the
head
is
a
very
light
tanish
yellow
color
with
little
retention
the
smell
is
a
little
hoppy
and
a
little
bit
of
malts
going
on
in
there
the
taste
is
malty
up
front
with
some
other
grains
and
finished
up
with
a
little
hoppy
bitterness
the
mouthfeel
is
light
and
easy
to
drink
like
most
of
leinies
brews
overall
its
not
bad
its
not
great
either
but
worth
trying
drinkable
but
unremarkable
im
not
a
big
fan
of
the
red
lager
style
if
you
like
this
one
is
probably
decent
not
a
bad
lager
though
and
id
drink
it
again
because
it
was
refreshing
but
simple
this
is
way
better
than
i
expected
it
to
be
lots
of
clean
flavors
and
very
refreshing
one
of
the
best
ive
had
from
this
brewery
d
fairly
simple
beer
but
good
flavor
a
pleasant
experience
overall
not
too
good
though
i
do
feel
leines
makes
a
couple
decent
beers
poured
from
a
brown
12
zo
bottle
has
a
caramel
color
with
a
1
inch
head
smell
is
dominated
by
malts
taste
is
also
very
malty
some
hops
present
clean
and
refreshing
feels
medium
bodied
in
the
mouth
and
is
very
drinkable
overall
a
good
quality
brew
overall
not
bad
like
i
said
best
of
the
lot
but
that
is
not
saying
a
whole
bunch
from
notes
poured
into
a
pint
glass
crystal
clear
light
copper
color
with
a
beige
head
that
fizzes
out
quickly
toasty
tangy
malt
aroma
with
nothing
else
really
flavor
is
similar
malty
with
a
faint
tanginess
and
a
cereal
grain
finish
light
body
with
mediumhigh
carbonation
good
drinkability
but
pretty
watery
and
boring
d
hey
it
is
not
a
bad
red
pretty
average
low
abv
makes
this
a
pretty
good
session
beer
nothing
to
run
out
looking
for
but
nothing
to
run
away
from
the
mouthfeel
is
light
a
bit
wispy
and
a
touch
sour
in
the
finish
could
use
a
lot
more
depth
and
complexity
would
like
more
malt
backing
and
the
hops
are
wrong
for
style
clean
yeast
notes
though
drinkability
fairly
drinkable
not
a
lot
of
complexity
but
not
bad
tasting
either
md
light
bodied
watered
down
feel
that
makes
it
easily
drinkable
but
than
again
the
low
quality
macros
are
easily
drinkable
but
doesnt
mean
id
want
to
overall
an
average
beer
overall
with
some
aspects
i
like
but
definitely
some
artificial
aspects
i
dont
d
wow
this
is
just
nothing
special
im
not
a
huge
fan
of
vienna
lagers
but
there
are
must
better
representations
of
the
style
than
this
one
pours
a
nice
amber
color
with
an
actual
head
creamy
and
sticks
to
the
glass
smell
is
modest
and
nice
slightly
toasty
with
a
bit
of
mineral
tastes
the
same
a
little
spicy
with
a
mostly
malt
presence
finishes
with
some
mild
bitterness
that
lingers
for
a
while
i
could
use
some
more
body
i
cant
help
but
think
this
is
akin
to
a
starter
homebrew
but
this
beer
is
pretty
decent
and
easy
to
drink
looks
more
than
decent
solid
red
color
with
orangeamber
coloring
good
head
of
1
finger
head
with
a
light
tan
color
clear
and
lively
smell
is
crisp
but
highly
adjunct
and
thin
aromas
taste
is
a
little
better
cheap
malt
character
and
some
noticeable
sweetness
acceptable
hops
taste
im
proud
to
say
true
to
vienna
styling
with
a
honey
hops
finish
taste
is
better
than
i
expected
tasty
pretty
balanced
and
crisp
with
a
clean
finish
some
sourness
present
but
overall
a
surprisingly
decent
macro
beer
poured
into
a
pint
glass
color
is
a
darker
ruby
color
with
an
offwhite
head
the
nose
is
some
bready
malt
with
a
bit
of
caramel
and
light
sweetness
the
taste
is
definitely
characteristic
of
some
amber
malt
with
a
bit
of
dryness
and
some
slight
earth
feel
is
a
bit
sweet
yet
still
slightly
dry
pretty
decent
drinkability
overall
but
not
something
id
really
come
back
to
poured
into
my
coors
banquet
beer
sampling
glass
i
like
the
amber
color
but
the
head
is
gone
in
a
flash
no
lacing
at
all
smell
is
almost
metallic
and
malts
taste
is
uneventful
a
little
bit
malty
and
some
caramel
mouthfeel
is
light
to
medium
body
drinkability
is
average
i
bought
a
sampler
with
thee
in
the
box
so
i
will
drink
one
or
two
more
d
few
distinctives
in
this
beer
make
it
unappealing
for
a
return
visit
id
have
another
one
of
these
in
fact
i
will
in
a
few
minutes
a
good
example
of
a
vienna
lager
from
my
somewhat
limited
experience
d
this
is
a
pretty
weak
beer
not
many
redeeming
qualities
apart
from
that
it
looks
like
a
good
beer
not
impressed
a
great
beer
looks
good
not
too
much
head
smell
of
strong
but
pleasant
hops
taste
is
strong
but
not
too
strong
but
it
keeps
you
coming
back
for
more
beer
mouthful
is
okay
could
be
better
drinkability
goes
along
with
taste
the
better
this
better
taste
the
more
you
feel
like
to
drink
and
the
more
that
you
will
drink
d
this
beer
is
merely
average
there
is
nothing
very
exciting
about
this
beer
just
ok
for
me
d
pretty
decent
for
the
style
good
for
more
than
one
d
all
faults
from
its
selfproclaimed
title
its
really
not
a
baddrinking
beer
for
those
grababrew
days
d
not
the
most
exciting
beer
in
the
world
but
its
light
and
goes
down
easy
a
nice
session
beer
taste
not
bad
better
than
killians
but
not
by
much
nor
anything
to
brag
about
a
real
straight
forward
beer
middle
of
the
road
got
a
lot
more
expensive
lately
not
worth
anywhere
near
6
99
a
6er
notes
a
flavorful
lager
that
inst
trying
too
hard
which
is
a
good
thing
since
it
is
just
a
soso
beer
cheers
okay
not
the
best
tasting
not
the
best
on
the
nose
not
the
best
drinking
experience
ever
but
hey
very
easy
to
drink
if
you
ask
me
makes
a
great
beer
from
a
keg
for
party
in
my
opinion
not
a
bad
offering
poured
into
a
shaker
pint
pours
a
big
foamy
offwhite
head
that
hangs
around
a
long
time
till
going
into
a
film
with
minor
lacing
clear
deep
reddish
copper
color
not
much
of
an
aroma
tastes
a
little
watered
down
almost
seems
like
more
maltiness
will
come
out
but
never
does
some
hoppy
bitterness
overall
i
wouldnt
turn
one
down
if
offered
but
will
not
go
out
of
my
way
to
get
one
drinkable
dthis
is
probably
not
one
that
ill
revisit
anytime
soon
but
id
probably
drink
it
if
someone
handed
it
to
me
at
a
party
the
reasonable
price
point
for
this
beer
doesnt
save
it
t
d
tastes
just
like
it
smells
and
this
is
nice
because
it
isnt
a
blowyourdoorsoff
hop
bomb
of
a
red
or
an
extrabitter
etc
as
the
vienna
style
indicates
its
an
easy
drinker
that
always
pleases
and
doesnt
make
your
brain
or
taste
buds
work
too
hard
amber

impressive
high
carbonation
thin
watery
and
not
the
best
drinkability
drinkability
an
average
vienna
lager
i
like
the
caramel
malt
but
it
is
rather
tameespecially
for
this
brewery
a
solid
beer
that
i
would
not
turn
down
but
most
likely
would
not
rush
out
for
either
leinenkugels
red
is
an
average
lager
that
is
an
easy
drinker
all
in
all
this
is
a
boring
beer
i
have
enjoyed
some
of
their
offerings
a
lot
more
than
this
one
drinkablity
good
brew
decent
richness
while
maintaining
overall
drinkability
for
a
vienna
lager
i
feel
that
this
beer
is
a
very
good
example
of
the
style
it
is
clean
and
has
the
toasty
quality
that
you
should
see
in
a
vienna
lager
the
melenoiden
character
is
nice
and
he
hops
are
sitting
where
they
should
be
for
this
beer
style
the
only
downfall
of
the
beer
is
that
it
is
a
bit
small
on
the
malt
side
although
all
the
flavor
and
aroma
components
are
there
they
are
just
too
small
this
here
beer
was
really
nice
to
drink
i
had
heard
a
lot
about
wisconsin
beers
and
this
brewery
in
particular
so
i
looked
forward
to
checking
this
one
out
it
turned
out
to
be
a
delightful
experience
poured
into
a
pint
glass
at
the
appropriate
temperature
for
a
lager
resulted
in
an
adequate
head
smell
and
appearance
were
good
however
taste
and
mouthfeel
were
just
average
this
is
a
drinkable
brew
i
look
forward
to
trying
more
varieties
from
this
brewery
drinkability
this
really
isnt
anything
to
write
home
about
drinkability
a
pretty
good
vienna
lager
this
style
is
hard
to
do
well
in
my
opinion
so
this
one
is
certainly
worth
a
try
pretty
generic
beer
not
a
big
favorite
drinkability
a
fairly
pedestrian
american
amber
beer
not
one
of
my
favorite
styles
to
begin
with
its
not
bad
but
its
not
anything
special
either
a
watered
down
almost
flat
beer
with
not
enough
flavor
to
make
you
want
to
drink
a
second
one
youre
better
off
drinking
a
light
beer
from
one
of
the
bigger
companies
at
least
that
way
youll
get
some
sort
of
taste
and
flavor
i
have
had
this
in
wisconsin
and
locally
and
it
tastes
just
as
good
as
the
brewery
as
good
in
bottles
and
on
tap
it
makes
the
killians
and
sam
adams
reds
wanting
more
and
not
getting
it
without
miller
involved
it
wasnt
getting
the
exposure
it
deserved
but
it
is
always
present
in
my
fridge
poured
a
clear
reddish
amber
with
a
respectable
head
that
faded
to
a
skin
the
aroma
was
slightly
malt
malty
sweetness
with
a
little
caramel
mouth
feel
was
light
bodied
with
a
good
carbonation

as

brew
not
anything
to
search
the
ends
of
the
earth
for
drinkability
this
is
pretty
good
its
certainly
something
i
could
drink
again
whoa
this
was
a
very
good
vienna
lager
creamy
malty
pretty
what
more
can
you
ask
for
i
coud
drink
this
all

and
i
just
might
a

with

sweetness
with
a
touch
of

for
some
balance
light
carbonationmedium
body
short
finish
quite
drinkable
but
nothing
very
special
for
me
pours
a
clear
copper
amber
color
the
carbonation
is
pretty
intense
that
you
see
there
is
a
one
finger
head
that
gives
way
to
okay
lacing
the
smell
is
of
malt
and
some
spices
maybe
cinnamon
the
taste
is
malty
with
a
slight
bite
of
hops
to
balance
it
out
the
mouthfeel
is
overly
carbonated
the
overall
drinkablity
isnt
that
high
you
could
have
one
or
two
but
not
more
than
that
i
had
trouble
putting
down
two
of
these
in
a
row
not
one
of
leinies
better
beers
i
know
that
many
talk
about
leinenkugels
as
a
good
tweener
that
acts
as
a
bridge
between
the
craft
beers
and
the
standard
macros
i
think
this
beer
fits
that
characterization
quite
well
its
not
too
special
but
its
better
than
something
massproduced
the
sweetness
is
nice
but
it
seems
a
bit
artificial
for
my
taste
this
is
a
good
beer
to
have
at
a
party
given
its
price
and
quality
i
dont
suggest
that
you
go
out
of
your
way
to
try
this
beer
if
youre
an
enthusiast
but
if
youre
just
entering
the
wonderful
world
of
beerdom
then
i
suggest
you
try
it
d
for
a
cheapo
session
brew
its
ok
i
wouldnt
go
out
of
my
way
to
get
it
but
if
its
available
and
my
budgets
tight
id
pick
it
up
every
now
and
then
grabbed
this
one
on
tap
because
it
was
the
best
of
the
offerings
kind
of
surprised
me
while
its
no
mean
a
brewing
masterpiece
it
is
a
nice
mild
light
little
red
lager
with
a
nicely
balanced
mix
of
malt
and
hops
i
dont
expect
much
from
leinenkugel
and
this
did
just
fine
this
beer
pours
a
clear
light
red
color
the
head
is
one
inch
in
height
and
recedes
into
a
nice
cap
of
lacing
the
aroma
is
of
faint
floral
hops
and
caramel
malt
the
taste
is
fairly
well
balanced
with
a
little
more
malt
than
hops
there
is
a
nice
lingering
maltiness
in
the
finish
the
mouthfeel
is
medium
bodied
with
a
lot
of
carbonation
overall
this
is
an
alright
beer
that
would
be
really
good
if
it
had
a
little
more
hops
in
the
taste
ans
aroma
i
have
drank
this
beer
numerous
times
at
bars
when
it
is
the
best
thing
available
and
will
continue
to
do
so
ive
had
mexican
vienna
lagers
that
are
better
than
thisvictoria
and
bohemia
thick
caramel
colored
head
which
regretablly
disappeard
quickly
obviously
being
a
red
it
was
a
darker
color
but
not
as
red
as
i
expected
looked
more
like
a
brown
with
red
hint
smells
of
some
hoppiness
and
spice
taste
hits
the
tongue
as
bitter
and
smooths
out
as
i
run
it
around
my
mouth
and
ends
with
a
very
slight
kick
of
nuttiness
enjoyable
but
not
the
most
drinkable
beer
a
couple
would
be
plenty
though
i
wouldnt
go
out
of
my
way
for
would
be
nice
to
have
to
persuade
your
simple
minded
buddies
away
from
macros
because
its
not
very
extreme
d
another
watered
down
red
with
not
enough
malt
to
save
its
self
some
flavor
i
would
rate
it
with
most
other
mid
level
reds
d
leinies
is
never
that
bad
i
guess
it
really
is
better
after
you
have
had
the
first
one
and
then
you
can
really
think
about
the
beer
a
little
more
but
the
same
can
be
said
about
most
of
the
commercial
brews
you
have
really
i
dont
know
if
it
is
the
beer
talking
beyond
that
point
but
i
think
it
is
best
put
in
the
same
terms
as
ruffles
if
your
going
to
drink
leinies
you
cant
have
just
one
their
red
lager
is
neither
bad
nor
that
good
but
whenever
i
go
over
to
dads
house
he
will
always
have
one
waiting
for
me
and
what
can
you
say
its
beer
and
sometimes
a
beer
is
better
than
no
beer
d
its
a
far
better
than
average
party
beer
something
you
could
have
lying
around
that
wouldnt
be
intimidating
to
just
take
but
isnt
crap
deasy
to
dring
quickly
but
not
one
that
i
would
reach
for
over
and
over
pretty
decent
beer
to
drink
since
its
not
expensive
mouthfeeldrinkability
carbonation
is
light
and
a
medium
body
make
this
an
easy
beer
to
drink
decent
atmosphere
appearance
a
bit
more
notably
but
a
distinctive
nose
as
well
pretty
decent
flavor
feel
is
okay
its
light
body
does
lend
to
good
drinkability
though
pretty
nice
quaff
good
lord
someone
should
bonk
me
on
the
head
the
next
time
i
reach
for
a
leine
because
i
have
yet
to
taste
one
that
i
would
consider
good
this
one
could
be
the
worst
yet
it
is
dreadful
it
doesnt
look
bad
mind
you
a
very
clear
amber
with
red
notes
some
carbonation
the
nose
is
typical
of
leine
beers
it
has
that
wet
cardboard
malty
mustiness
that
just
seems
indicative
of
a
cheaply
made
beer
one
or
two
sips
of
this
and
away
it
went
this
has
a
very
dry
cracked
malty
flavor
with
a
strong
musty
red
roasted
graininess
that
is
really
hard
to
get
down
the
aftertaste
is
like
a
chemical
explosion
in
the
mouth
of
flavors
that
just
shouldnt
be
there
and
have
no
business
being
something
one
would
drink
wow
this
is
bad
stuff
drinkability
is
average
it
goes
down
pretty
easy
and
this
would
make
a
great
cheap
pizza
beer
this
beer
isnt
fantastic
but
has
a
nice
enough
flavor
and
drinkability
that
it
could
be
paired
with
some
other
snacky
foods
or
improved
decent
but
less
than
spectacular
lacing
somewhat
respectable
head
of
foam
though
again
nothing
spectacular
a
rich
redamber
hue
with
about
a
medium
body
some
hint
of
spice
and
a
little
nuttiness
but
traces
of
bitterness
at
times
nothing
spectacular
but
you
could
give
it
a
try
not
bad
reminds
me
of
murphys
red
not
an
overpowering
taste
not
too
light
either
probably
better
in
the
summertime
but
living
in
a
warm
climate
as
i
do
enjoyable
even
in
january
not
as
good
as
my
favourite
red
boreal
amber
but
not
bad
and
worth
a
try
if
available
to
yall
pours
a
fireball
red
coloring
with
a
very
frothy
tannish
head
aroma
is
of
lightly
roasted
hops
and
some
dark
cherry
the
graininess
and
maltiness
counterbalance
the
sweetness
in
a
way
that
is
somewhat
pleasant
at
first
i
thought
i
was
drinking
it
too
cold
but
as
it
warmed
it
still
didnt
have
much
of
a
taste
dnot
great
this
beer
has
few
redeeming
characteristics
and
i
dont
expect
ill
look
for
this
one
any
more
in
the
future
this
beer
would
be
a
good
one
if
youre
going
to
drink
several
for
an
evening
with
its
thinner
body
and
flavor
poured
a
deep
amber
color
with
offwhite
head
that
held
some
decent
lacing
sweet
maltyness
with
some
grains
on
the
aroma
taste
is
of
grains
and
has
a
fresh
biscuit
flavor
as
well
minimal
hop
flavor
medium
body
and
nice
carbonation
combine
for
a
good
mouthfeel
and
also
make
it
very
drinkable
flavor
is
not
unified
in
this
one
unimpressive
a
solid
drinkable
lager
could
be
really
good
if
they
gave
the
hops
a
little
bump
no
overwhelming
taste
or
complexity
here
but
okay
as
a
well
rounded
any
occassion
beer
in
my
opinion
can
hit
home
with
the
cheap
beer
drinkers
and
passes
for
those
who
like
more
complex
beers
definately
an
okay
beer
and
i
always
come
back
to
this
one
a
great
introductory
beer
to
anyone
that
usually
indulges
in
cheap
beer
to
open
their
horizons
on
the
true
world
of
beer
overall
very
passable
not
recommended
i
wont
be
drinking
this

i

for
such
a

above
the
macro
lagers

californias
craft
brewers
put
this
to
shame
california
already
gets
much
better
products
aimed
at
the
mass
market
from
the
pacific
northwest
definite
pass
i
bought
a
few
12
oz
bottles
to
share
with
my
soninlaw
i
found
this
beer
to
average
throughout
the
appearance
was
of
course
reddish
and
it
did
pour
with
a
decent
head
the
smell
and
taste
were
okay
but
nothing
spectacular
the
mouthfell
likewise
was
soso
i
would
not
add
this
to
my
favorites
d
easy
to
drink
with
very
average
qualities
for
a
craft
beer
i
like
it
d
fairly
easy
to
drink
just
nothing
to
it
d
drinkable
just
nothing
very
special
d
low
on
flavor
and
aroma
this
is
a
halfway
decent
stab
at
a
drinkable
lager
this
reminds
me
of
amber
bock
or
something
not
really
all
that
good
and
not
very
flavorful
but
better
than
a
pale
lager
when
you
are
at
a
restaurant
or
bar
that
doesnt
carry
craft
brews
got
this
in
a
leinenkugels
variety
pack
given
as
a
gift
leinies
red
is
an
average
red
lager
that
goes
down
quite
easy
and
wont
fill
you
up
much
but
it
is
far
from
outstanding
leinies
red
looks
quite
nice
poured
from
the
bottle
a
light
redish
hue
topped
off
by
a
nice
head
of
foam
which
dissipates
after
a
couple
sips
the
malty
smell
is
poorer
than
expected
even
kind
of
rottenish
i
prefer
to
not
sniff
it
and
take
it
straight
to
the
mouth
where
it
is
all
right
but
nothing
above
average
a
slight
sour
tasting
lager
red
is
easy
drinking
but
ultimately
thin
and
without
a
lot
of
character
poured
from
the
bottle
into
a
glass
nice
light
amber
color
with
minimal
head
and
decent
lacing
sweet
malty
aroma
that
reminds
me
a
little
of
licorice
the
mouthfeel
is
full
and
smooth
with
an
exceptional
finish
the
flavor
is
really
nice
sweet
malts
dominate
the
overall
taste
followed
by
a
hint
of
hops
there
is
a
slight
watered
downthinness
to
the
flavor
but
not
the
body
of
this
beer
which
is
perplexing
overall
i
do
enjoy
this
lager
much
better
than
most
of
the
standards
that
are
out
there
leinenkugel
has
yet
to
disappoint
me
been
years
since
i
have
had
leinys
red
but
now
after
trying
many
different
beers
and
coming
back
to
red
it
is
actually
pretty
good
color
is
a
dark
copper
with
an
impressive
head
and
retention
the
aroma
is
malt
with
a
slight
citrus
component
the
flavor
is
malty
with
a
mild
hop
bitterness
it
is
a
bit
astringent
with
a
metallic
note
a
bit
overcarbonated
but
has
a
satisfying
body
a
better
than
average
lager
for
sure
nice
alternative
to
the
pale
lagers
and
quite
widely
available
in
this
area
leinenkugels
red
is
a
very
good
introduction
for
a
beer
drinker
who
thinks
killians
is
a
good
red
the
beer
is
reddish
brown
in
color
with
a
rapidly
dissipating
head
the
beer
is
best
cold
but
its
extremely
pleasant
to
drink
a
pitcher
with
some
bw3s
buffalo
wings
the
flavor
is
semiastringent
bitterness
mixed
with
grassymetallic
tracings
the
mouthfeel
is
thin
but
hearty
in
a
weird
way
you
feel
like
youre
drinking
a
very
solid
lager
with
excellent
thirstquenching
abilities
pours
reddish
with
a
lasting
beige
head
smell
is
mostly
slightly
tart
and
sweet
caramelly
malt
taste
is
actually
quite
hoppy
up
front
and
throughout
with
a
nice
citrusy
and
lemony
bittersweet
caramel
malt
flavor
this
was
balanced
refreshing
and
actually
pretty
enjoyable
surprisingly
drinkability
is
fair
quite
a
substandard
lager
with
too
much
carbonation
easytodrink
but
lacking
in
any
creative
or
bold
flavors
it
does
however
have
a
nice
drinkable
balance
to
it
one
of
my
goto
beers
when
trying
to
save
some
or
picking
up
a
12er
to
bring
for
a
crowd
pleaser
to
a
party
bottle
crimson
pour
and
quite
carbonated
pretty
good
for
leineys
i
think
this
is
a
good
deal
better
than
their
other
mass
produced
beer
honey
weiss
i
liked
it
something
to
get
when
you
dont
have
alot
of
cash
and
dont
want
to
buy
the
regular
american
pale
lagers
resonably
priced
and
decent
taste
is
a
good
combination
this
is
a
pretty
decent
offering
for
the
price
i
made
a
session
of
five
of
these
while
watching
a
cubs
game
yesterday
and
it
was
fine
for
that
that
being
said
it
did
not
endear
itself
to
me
so
much
that
i
would
pick
it
over
other
offerings
in
the
price
range
try
it
had
a
couple
of
these
on
the
plane
on
the
way
home
a
decent
brew
defenitely
one
to
take
on
hiking
trips
cans
in
the
summer
pours
an
amber
red
color
with
pretty
good
head
and
lacing
malty
aroma
taste
is
lagery
crispness
with
a
little
boosted
malt
presence
some
slight
caramel
maltishness
but
very
very
faint
a
good
session
brew
that
is
easily
portable
keep
in
mind
this
review
may
be
flawed
from
drinking
nothing
but
lager
in
south
africa
for
the
last
two
weeks
haha
this
lager
pours
a
clear
red
color
with
a
weak
beige
head
the
nose
has
some
stale
malts
and
not
much
else
the
taste
reminds
me
more
of
lager
than
red
really
light
malts
with
some
old
hops
the
body
is
watery
and
over
carbonated
i
had
a
few
sips
of
this
and
dumped
the
rest
out
mouthfeel
is
pretty
light
and
thin
sharp
and
almost
acrid
carbonation
as
far
as
vienna
lagers
go
give
me
a
boulevard
bobs
47
went
down
smooth
and
satisfying
ill
be
buying
a
sixer
next
time
instead
of
a
single
not
a
bad
lager
could
have
a
bit
more
complexity
pours
a
hardy
rouge
color
with
an
ok
head
smells
of
little
malts
and
maybe
a
floral
hop
in
the
very
back
tastes
pretty
clean
with
a
mild
malt
and
an
even
more
mild
hop
character
had
it
in
a
pint
glass
nice
burnt
red
tone
with
a
finger
or
two
of
head
space
lite
taste
little
fruit
taste
and
bubbly
goes
down
fast
ill
give
it
a
whirl
from
time
to
time
for
something
refreshing
this
would
work
i
prefer
my
beers
black
but
i
had
to
try
a
leinies
since
i
was
in
northern
wi
fishing
not
the
greatest
beer
ive
ever
had
and
not
one
id
ever
purchase
at
a
store
but
it
was
a
decent
option
from
the
crap
thats
generally
available
on
a
flight
met
my
needs
at
the
time
poured
a
nice
red
color
with
very
little
head
and
no
lacing
to
speak
of
clean
scent
a
little
sweet
but
very
weak
the
taste
was
weak
as
well
a
nice
mix
of
malts
and
hops
but
very
little
in
the
way
of
defining
character
other
than
a
little
bit
of
sweetness
goes
down
fine
not
the
smoothest
beer
but
its
not
rough
either
poured
a
light
cherry
color
that
foamed
a
small
white
head
that
vanished
fairly
rapidly
nose
was
kind
of
blah
malts
is
about
all
you
smell
here
the
flavor
stayed
the
same
throughout
no
late
bitterness
or
anything
like
that
this
beer
was
soft
if
you
dont
like
bitterness
or
bite
it
might
be
easy
drinking
for
you
overall
you
wont
be
thrilled
but
youll
be
refreshed
the
drinkability
is
not
so
good
i
will
not
need
to
drink
this
brew
again
mk
this
beer
poured
a
brown
color
with
a
thick
white
head
tight
bubbles
the
aroma
is
faint
and
slightly
floral
the
taste
is
malty
and
a
bit
spicy
the
mouthfeel
is
mediumlight
with
a
carbonation
bite
this
isnt
a
difficult
beer
to
drink
but
it
isnt
particularly
interesting
either
not
a
bad
beer
not
a
great
beer
or
even
a
good
beer
but
it
is
an
ok
beer
has
a
crisp
hoppy
taste
with
a
bubbly
punch
to
the
tongue
the
flavor
is
nothing
extraordinary
and
the
smell
is
neither
sort
of
bitter
sweet
in
taste
still
it
is
an
easy
to
drink
beer
and
one
worth
more
then
one
bottle
of
if
its
available
at
some
kind
of
social
gathering
its
alright
i
could
drink
it
on
occasion
slight
bitterness
in
the
back
of
the
throat
smooth
maltiness
across
the
palate
at
first
yeast
produces
a
vague
fruity
note
light
and
a
little
watery
slight
dextrinous
sweetness
but
easy
drinking
wouldnt
refuse
this
under
any
circumstances
its
a
bailout
beer
in
many
a
crappy
dive
bar
mediumbodied
and
a
moderate
level
of
carbonation
not
much
to
it
but
not
offensive
either
this
beer
defines
average
theres
a
weird
orangeredbrown
color
like
i
ate
those
colors
of
crayola
crayons
then
puked
them
into
a
glass
thats
what
the
foam
indicates
also
i
guess
a
burnt
sienna
crayon
could
be
in
there
too
and
i
dont
have
a
cold
but
still
i
cant
smell
much
slight
malt
smell
but
very
mild
not
much
aroma
at
all
not
much
taste
either
very
slight
detection
of
sweet
malt
and
thats
about
it
not
too
bitter
its
easy
to
drink
because
it
not
much
of
anything
leinenkugel
makes
better
beers
than
this
one
the
big
butt
dopplebock
is
pretty
good
and
the
sunset
wheats
good
but
i
wont
get
the
red
again
its
classified
as
a
vienna
lager
but
its
not
even
close
to
what
a
vienna
lager
should
be
im
going
to
try
the
honey
weiss
one
right
now
red
lagers
are
very
good
about
taste
this
one
is
no
exception
this
local
brew
is
very
good
like
one
of
the
most
recent
beer
advocates
killians
irish
red
is
very
much
like
leinenkugels
the
taste
was
average
with
little
hints
of
hops
with
a
smooth
smell
it
goes
down
smooth
and
little
effort
it
is
again
one
of
those
beers
i
suggest
if
your
in
the
area
you
will
have
to
try
and
get
a
12pack
i
am
reviewing
this
beer
after
3
weeks
removed
from
drinking
it
so
i
cant
say
much
except
that
i
love
red
lagers
and
killians
is
one
of
my
favs
i
give
this
a
beer
a
6
out
of
10
in
relation
to
that
12
oz
bottle
pours
clear
amber
with
1
5
cm
offwhite
head
that
is
quickly
diminishing
aroma
is
very
light
and
slightly
sweet
initial
flavor
is
balanced
with
malts
and
hops
no
distinct
flavors
lightly
flavored
pretty
watered
down
no
real
aftertaste
light
watery
body
no
lacing
no
alcohol
noted
drinkable
as
better
than
some
domestics
from
macrobrewers
but
would
most
likely
need
a
gun
to
my
head
to
drink
it
again
pours
an
amberred
color
with
decent
white
head
that
hung
around
a
while
aroma
is
not
real
strong
but
is
a
bit
malty
flavor
doesnt
really
have
any
real
strong
dominant
characteristics
either
mouthfeel
is
okay
and
lacing
was
light
average
beer
that
is
easy
drinking
this
one
pours
a
little
red
indeed
mostly
brown
or
auburn
head
is
medium
but
wont
stay
around
you
can
smell
hop
and
malts
easy
to
drink
but
a
little
metallic
or
bitter
easy
to
get
and
moderately
priced
still
better
than
macros
taste
is
unique
to
me
taste
is
slightly
grainy
slightly
bitter
fairly
balanced
with
no
particular
part
of
it
standing
out
on
the
downside
no
particular
part
of
this
beer
is
worthy
of
standing
out
a
good
if
not
overwhelming
lager
pours
an
amber
with
minimal
head
a
virtually
nonexistent
nose
taste
seemed
to
have
a
somewhat
apple
tone
and
i
felt
there
was
a
thick
syrupy
finish
that
stays
on
the
mouth
its
easily
drinkable
and
certainly
is
a
good
session
beer
with
a
smooth
mouthfeel
though
i
wouldnt
pine
for
the
day
to
be
seeing
it
in
the
store
for
me
to
buy
best
when
fresh
like
i
got
it
im
glad
this
was
the
alternative
to
bud
bud
light
on
my
flight
northwest
airlines
drinkability
excellent
this
beer
can
go
with
almost
anything
and
is
enjoyable
pretty
much
all
the
time
dinner
a
ballgame
or
a
nice
long
bar
session
at
the
end
of
the
week
this
is
what
a
bluecollar
wisconsin
beer
should
be
not
the
plagues
of
miller
pabst
schlitz
and
pabst
i
wonder
how
this
tasted
before
miller
got
their
hands
on
it
anyway
despite
the
above
negatives
seriously
check
out
this
brew
on
color
alone
i
have
no
idea
how
they
can
pack
that
much
color
into
such
an
otherwise
average
brew
i
poured
a
cold
red
into
a
pilsner
style
glass
and
enjoyed
a
light
sweet
smell
after
sniffing
the
beer
i
wanted
to
drink
it
immediately
it
poured
a
nice
two
finger
head
with
plenty
of
lacing
the
taste
was
not
as
sweet
as
the
smell
but
it
was
nice
and
smooth
with
good
mouth
feel
the
after
taste
was
a
little
hoppier
than
i
had
expected
but
it
was
nice
i
dont
have
a
lot
of
experience
with
red
ales
but
i
know
that
i
liked
this
one
and
would
definitely
reach
for
it
again
comes
out
a
crystal
clear
orange
copper
color
with
a
light
tan
head
that
doesnt
dwindle
away
too
fast
after
the
heads
settles
down
into
a
thin
layer
you
begin
to
see
some
mild
lacing
theres
very
little
carbonation
it
does
smell
sweet
and
has
a
mild
scent
of
caramel
but
i
didnt
smell
anything
resembling
hops
it
has
a
sharp
slightly
bitter
taste
but
it
is
smooth
and
it
has
a
sweet
hoppy
flavor
in
its
aftertaste
its
got
a
fairly
light
body
but
full
of
flavor
overall
id
have
to
say
this
is
leinekugels
best
but
i
havent
tried
them
all
yet
d
this
beer
is
easy
to
drink
could
be
a
session
beer
pours
an
orangey
color
aroma
is
average
nothing
to
brag
about
there
taste
has
corn
but
there
is
also
a
hint
of
sweetness
i
would
recommend
this
beer
to
my
friends
and
i
would
buy
it
if
i
came
across
it
again
this
is
a
much
better
offering
than
their
honey
weiss
overall
this
is
one
of
leinies
better
beers
and
can
be
mixed
with
several
other
leiny
products
for
many
different
tastes
pours
a
nice
crisp
amber
with
a
decent
offwhite
head
decent
caramel
aroma
with
a
hint
of
earthy
citrus
hops
the
taste
is
not
what
the
aroma
advertised
in
fact
there
doesnt
seem
to
be
much
to
the
taste
at
all
some
maltiness
but
the
color
seems
to
be
the
only
thing
distinguishing
it
from
a
normal
macro
lager
the
beer
is
light
bodied
but
that
doesnt
really
matter
with
the
lack
of
flavor
this
one
will
make
for
a
moderately
decent
nightcap
at
best
drinkability
an
average
red
that
i
would
drink
again
but
i
would
not
go
out
of
my
way
drinkability
is
good
not
much
here
just
malts
and
a
touch
of
grassy
hops
pours
red
go
figure
25
head
whispy
poor
retention
taste
pretty
good
definately
some
decent
roasted
malt
here
a
little
bitter
some
hops
detectable
nicengrassy
caramel
a
thankfully
not
worse
metallic
hint
all
these
flavors
are
subdued
like
the
mouthfeel
this
is
a
decent
fall
brew
just
a
chill
in
the
air
with
an
easy
drinkin
red
to
keep
you
goin
suprisingly
for
4
9
both
in
taste
and
flavor
for
an
accessible
brewat
least
in
the
midwest
you
could
do
worse
like
others
ive
had
from
leiny
this
is
a
good
session
beer
and
one
i
could
probably
drink
several
of
on
a
hot
sumer
day
but
not
one
to
just
sit
and
enjoy
not
bad
not
great
if
you
compare
it
to
macro
lagers
or
other
miller
products
even
then
its
a
pretty
damn
fine
beer
to
have
under
their
belt
but
as
far
as
vienna
lagers
go
its
a
little
bit
unimpressive
overall
a
pretty
good
dark
amber
with
good
flavors
satisfying
and
easy
to
drink
but
only
slightly
above
ordinary
by
leinenkugels
standards
its
good
not
a
great
beer
not
a
horrible
one
either
i
think
i
can
sum
this
beer
up
with
one
word
meh
no
hops
no
malt
once
again
almost
like
drinking
carbonated
water
that
looked
like
good
beer
d
fairly
drinkable
but
not
complexity
to
really
enjoy
better
lagers
and
yet
another
choice
for
a
good
session
brew
decent
overall
this
is
a
good
beer
better
on
tap
than
any
other
serving
styles
ive
had
this
in
the
flavor
is
as
you
might
expect
based
on
the
aroma
and
its
subtle
caramel
character
blends
quite
well
with
its
delicate
floral
and
grassy
hops
the
bitterness
is
restrained
and
needs
to
be
because
theres
really
not
that
much
malt
here
just
a
tiny
step
above
a
standard
american
macro
lager
it
finishes
dry
with
some
residual
hoppiness
and
a
quick
fading
note
of
malt
i
had
this
beer
on
tap
at
maurys
tiny
cove
in
cheviot
oh
it
goes
great
with
a
cheeseburger
and
fries
this
is
the
beer
that
inspired
me
to
give
homebrewing
a
try
it
has
a
nice
zip
is
flavorful
and
has
a
crisp
finish
the
is
the
definitive
red
lager
well
done
leinenkugel
its
hard
to
make
a
well
balanced
red
ale
the
hops
usually
get
in
the
way
of
the
malt
or
theyre
not
present
at
all
and
when
balance
is
achieved
its
usually
way
heavier
than
the
style
is
supposed
to
be
i
am
amazed
that
i
am
saying
this
but
leinenkugels
a
subsidiary
of
miller
brewing
company
has
made
an
excellent
example
of
the
style
with
their
red
not
servicable
not
decent
excellent
this
had
a
distinct
caramel
taste
like
killians
but
not
as
strong
a
pretty
easy
drinking
beer
but
a
warning
drink
only
if
you
know
you
are
in
a
distribution
region
or
you
may
be
drinking
an
old
beer
that
didnt
sell
well
my
mistake
the
first
time
i
tried
it
there
was
a
slight
bite
to
it
not
quite
bitter
more
like
a
sour
bite
probably
the
breakdown
of
the
sugar
in
it
i
would
recommend
this
but
try
to
drink
close
to
the
source
wisconsin
this
has
a
color
slightly
lighter
than
killians
but
not
as
strong
or
sweet
tasting
still
a
halfway
decent
lager
it
doesnt
have
that
flat
taste
that
the
big
brewers
have
but
it
doesnt
have
the
kick
that
most
craft
beers
have
comparable
to
heineken
in
taste
easy
to
drink
red
copper
color
i
dont
know
if
i
would
go
out
of
my
way
to
find
it
but
alas
free
to
me
beer
is
beer
indeed
really
cause
yeah
its
interesting
enough
but
doesnt
wow
me
drinkability
tastes
similar
to
a
killians
but
is
easier
for
me
to
drink
started
as
a
little
bitter
but
after
the
3rd
or
4th
sip
became
really
smooth
not
very
strong
but
nice
beer
to
drink
while
watching
a
game
on
tv
it
pours
a
nice
deep
orange
color
with
a
creamy
small
white
head
it
has
a
nice
aroma
of
toasty
malts
it
is
slightly
bitter
to
the
tongue
at
first
and
mellows
into
nice
malt
overtones
it
is
pretty
well
balanced
but
may
be
slightly
on
the
bitter
side
which
i
actually
prefer
it
leaves
a
wonderful
aftertaste
of
toasty
malty
vanilla
flavor
it
isnt
extremely
drinkable
but
you
can
definitely
put
down
a
few
of
these
in
one
sitting
overall
not
bad
and
well
worth
trying
if
you
havent
had
it
yet
this
is
a
crisp
beer
that
starts
off
slightly
bitter
and
mellows
into
creamy
vienna
malt
goodness
with
a
nice
toasty
undertone
there
is
a
very
soft
wisp
of
hop
in
the
finish
this
is
an
extremely
soft
smooth
and
balanced
beer
this
is
probably
the
best
vienna
lager
i
have
had
althought
id
have
to
put
it
up
against
negra
to
see
for
sure
drinks
allright
a
blast
from
the
past
the
classic
crossover
beer
i
wonder
if
it
was
any
better
before
miller
got
their
hooks
in
had
it
back
in
the
mid
90s
it
tasted
about
the
same
nice
head
and
retention
that
stays
for
a
while
the
smell
is
nice
and
present
but
a
little
weird
thin
on
the
malts
and
hops
arent
very
good
average
taste
but
a
little
bit
of
an
astringent
dryness
that
isnt
very
pleasant
at
all
mouthfeel
is
thin
and
watery
i
could
drink
this
beer
easily
but
the
wateriness
would
make
me
search
for
something
else
readily
available
a
very
simple
beer
but
tasty
and
very
cheap
around
here
is
the
same
price
of
buds
and
millers
and
definitely
a
lot
better
poured
beer
from
bottle
into
a
pint
glass
beer
is
golden
amber
in
color
with
an
offwhite
foamy
head
smell
is
sweet
mostly
of
crystal
malt
the
beer
is
well
balanced
with
an
initial
malty
taste
followed
by
a
hoppy
dry
finish
the
mouthfeel
is
medium
bodied
with
a
good
amount
of
carbonation
creamy
overall
this
beer
is
a
definitely
drinkable
and
for
the
price
its
a
pretty
good
value
drinkability
quaffer
i
remember
this
being
a
better
beer
but
it
drinks
like
something
that
was
rushed
goes
down
easy
but
without
much
good
flavor
d
dont
think
id
get
this
again
not
very
fresh
tasting
pretty
unimpressive
overall
a
decent
beer
but
not
one
ill
go
out
of
my
way
for
again
this
beer
isnt
bad
but
theres
not
much
to
recommend
it
has
the
backbone
of
something
good
but
appears
to
have
been
dumbed
down
for
mass
appeal
overall
not
a
bad
macro
offering
similar
to
a
genny
red
a
flavorable
alternative
to
bmc
thanks
to
makeitavintage
for
this
one
d
it
is
much
better
than
most
of
the
macro
reds
but
has
no
game
for
the
craft
variety
this
is
styled
after
very
drinkable
as
it
doesnt
offend
the
taste
buds
but
there
are
better
choices
for
a
night
out
enjoying
brews
with
friends
id
recommend
this
beer
if
you
want
to
try
an
easy
going
lightbodied
amber
brew
i
said
why
not
i
enjoyed
the
big
butt
from
leinenkugel
i
just
did
not
enjoy
this
one
especially
compared
to
the
other
vienna
lagers
ive
enjoyed
lately
it
is
crisp
and
rather
light
with
a
malty
characteristic
just
not
my
thang
do
not
recommend
this
one
pours
a
reddish
amber
color
topped
by
a
small
amount
of
creamy
white
head
that
quickly
subsides
to
a
thin
ring
leaving
some
nice
lacing
on
the
glass
aroma
of
light
roasted
malt
with
a
touch
of
adjunct
funkiness
and
not
much
else
palate
is
roasted
malt
blended
with
adjunct
and
some
kinda
harsh
hops
for
balance
still
pleasant
for
a
massproduced
lager
body
is
sturdy
if
a
touch
foamy
i
could
see
drinking
a
few
of
these
if
options
were
slim
up
in
wisconsin
or
similar
locales
not
a
bad
beer
really
it
is
what
it
is
d
it
is
a
descent
lager
it
certainly
isnt
my
favorite
lenie
but
it
will
work
after
drinking
quite
a
few
of
leinenkugels
brews
lately
i
didnt
hold
out
much
hope
for
the
red
but
i
found
myself
liking
it
a
little
hopped
up
for
the
style
but
it
hides
a
lot
of
wouldbe
flaws
toasted
malts
give
a
rich
but
mild
malt
sweetness
caramel
and
toasty
flavors
feels
a
little
less
than
creamy
or
smooth
but
not
watery
either
finish
is
a
little
malty
sweet
but
offset
by
the
added
hops
a
simple
but
solid
brew
drinkability
is
good
as
well
poured
a
reddish
orange
clear
with
a
thin
and
quikly
dissipating
white
head
smell
is
slightly
malty
with
just
a
bit
of
spicy
hop
in
there
taste
is
not
bad
a
little
thin
some
caramel
malt
taste
slight
hop
better
than
killians
and
other
big
brewery
reds
ive
had
and
wotrh
a
try
just
not
quite
enough
flavor
for
me
the
color
is
an
attractive
shade
somewhere
between
red
and
amber
head
body
is
creamy
and
thick
with
an
average
height
aroma
is
of
sweet
malt
with
light
touches
of
toastiness
and
caramel
taste
is
sugary
sweet
with
lightly
toasted
and
caramel
malts
better
flavors
are
overun
by
the
sweetness
that
is
too
strong
and
somewhat
cloying
this
is
average
accross
the
board
i
wanted
to
like
this
beer
i
really
did
the
leinenkugels
culture
marketing
packaging
etc
was
so
appealing
but
in
the
end
the
book
didnt
live
up
to
its
cover
pale
reddish
color
reminded
me
of
strawberry
soda
with
minimal
head
a
bit
spritzy
and
thin
in
the
mouth
the
taste
at
first
was
rather
benign
but
as
the
glass
wore
on
i
noted
a
strong
alcohol
taste
that
seemed
to
overpower
it
all
not
something
id
recommend
i
still
have
extremely
high
hopes
for
the
other
leinies
products
im
a
leinies
lodge
member
after
all
i
cant
wait
to
visit
wisconsin
and
see
if
all
their
beers
taste
better
in
its
home
state
all
in
all
i
didnt
think
this
was
a
bad
beer
it
poured
a
nice
reddish
color
with
about
an
inch
of
foam
at
the
top
that
didnt
stick
around
for
very
long
i
got
some
citrusy
hints
from
the
smell
but
couldnt
pick
up
much
else
overall
taste
was
pretty
good
not
spectacular
but
not
horrible
a
not
too
strong
bitter
finish
on
the
beer
made
me
want
to
keep
coming
back
the
mouthfeel
was
very
light
at
first
and
then
gave
way
to
some
noticeable
carbonation
on
the
whole
drinkability
is
pretty
good
theres
other
beers
id
choose
first
but
i
would
still
take
this
if
given
the
chance
what
can
i
say
but
that
this
is
killians
little
brother
who
tags
along
and
pretends
hes
all
grown
up
too
and
i
guess
he
is
if
we
can
call
a
beer
a
he
and
give
it
human
charateristics
and
wants
but
he
isnt
brash
enough
to
put
up
a
billboard
proclaiming
savored
its
not
as
baritone
i
know
i
make
nonbeer
comparisons
but
im
an
intuitist
at
heart
as
his
pseudoirish
brother
from
budskiland
or
wherever
it
is
big
red
is
from
but
this
little
bird
sings
just
as
loud
and
for
a
few
pennies
less
plus
it
has
an
indian
as
its
emblem
and
what
says
beer
like
a
stoicfaced
injun
three
cross
bows
and
a
pouch
of
wampum
a
common
stepup
beer
a
milwaukee
church
festivals
famous
for
featuring
miller
lite
this
brew
pours
red
in
those
plastic
church
cups
with
a
light
head
with
a
lager
flavor
red
is
a
great
beer
with
brat
and
cheese
curds
it
cuts
the
fat
of
these
foods
with
a
refreshing
finish
a
good
fill
in
beer
in
a
pinch
until
you
get
to
your
favorite
pub
for
your
top
brew
pours
a
coppery
red
what
head
forms
quickly
dissipates
quickly
smellwise
caramel
and
sweet
malts
dominate
with
some
traces
of
floral
hops
as
far
as
taste
goes
its
nothing
real
complex
just
sweet
up
front
with
a
very
light
cirtus
finish
from
the
malts
its
a
little
too
thin
and
lightbodied
for
my
tastes
but
its
highly
drinkable
and
is
not
bad
for
a
leines
theres
better
vienna
lagers
out
there
negra
modelo
and
bohemia
come
to
mind
but
leines
red
is
a
decent
abiet
average
beer
id
probably
still
not
pass
one
up
if
offered
one
or
more
not
a
bad
leines
as
with
other
leines
a
smooth
easy
drinking
brew
that
trades
fullness
of
flavor
for
easy
of
drinking
d
better
than
killians
red
but
that
is
not
saying
much
is
it
i
guess
my
point
is
if
you
are
going
to
brew
this
style
it
cant
be
strip
filtered
and
perhaps
pasteurized
lacks
that
malty
lager
freshness
not
bad
but
nothing
to
go
out
of
your
way
for
drinkability
not
as
poor
as
many
of
leinies
products
the
flavor
is
not
bad
on
this
beer
but
doesnt
match
up
to
the
standards
for
a
dunkel
id
drink
this
before
most
large
brewery
products
i
would
not
however
buy
this
if
i
wanted
a
dunkel
easy
enough
to
drink
but
nothing
special
my
memories
of
this
beer
are
much
better
than
the
beer
itself
a
simple
beer
but
man
what
a
good
tasting
one
the
beer
poured
a
vibrant
amber
color
with
a
medium
thickness
tan
head
that
lasted
a
few
minutes
the
aroma
is
of
caramel
but
balanced
out
somewhat
with
some
hop
bitterness
the
taste
is
a
bit
of
caramel
with
some
citrus
notes
and
a
touch
of
bitterness
but
not
overpowering
this
is
a
very
drinkable
beer
as
it
is
fairly
light
and
refreshing
clear
red
with
a
bit
of
an
orange
hue
topped
by
a
thin
skim
of
white
foam
sweet
caramel
in
the
aroma
along
with
some
bitey
herbal
hops
light
bitterness
not
enough
to
balance
the
sweetness
very
mild
citrus
and
floral
hops
make
a
brief
appearance
herbal
character
lingers
the
body
is
light
but
feels
a
bit
syrupy
yet
dries
the
palate
quite
strange
and
not
appealing
to
me
at
all
i
can
see
why
so
many
people
drink
this
beer
its
non
offensive
and
gets
the
job
done
mouthfeel
is
a
bit
thin
yet
creamy
it
beats
the
hell
out
of
any
macro
drinkability
very
very
drinkable
an
excellent
session
beer
there
are
better
vienna
lagers
out
there
but
this
is
always
reliable
cheap
and
easy
to
find
people
dont
give
leinies
enough
credit
this
is
what
i
figure
budweiser
should
taste
like
but
doesnt
i
was
back
to
my
original
happy
hour
grounds
in
detroit
last
month
and
savored
leinenkugel
for
three
weeks
it
is
not
available
in
my
current
hometown
of
san
diego
red
trolley
there
is
similar
tasting
strangely
enough
i
learned
that
red
trolley
is
brewed
in
wisconsin
where
leinenkugel
is
from
and
trucked
to
calif
leinenkugels
red
is
the
first
member
of
the
j
leinenkugel
family
i
ever
tried
and
still
enjoy
occasionally
any
of
which
are
excellent
values
at
no
more
than
6
a
six
pack
and
far
better
than
any
six
pack
ive
found
at
that
price
readily
available
at
practically
every
grocer
and
liquor
store
around
leines
red
pours
a
dark
crimson
with
little
or
no
head
that
quickly
gives
way
to
a
miniscule
amberhued
lace
a
little
overcarbonated
for
my
liking
although
does
not
take
away
from
the
light
bouqet
of
fruit
and
citrus
flavors
light
mouthfeel
finishes
clean
with
a
crisp
aftertaste
pours
a
brownish
orange
hue
with
great
clarity
dense
one
finger
head
with
decent
retention
and
weak
lacing
toasted
munich
malt
and
caramel
aromas
but
no
hops
sweet
upfront
like
toffe
and
amber
malt
balanced
well
with
a
semidry
and
hoppy
aftertaste
but
this
faux
german
hop
flavor
becomes
stale
and
harsh
in
the
finish
light
body
and
lively
carbonation
soften
the
mouthfeel
but
the
offensive
hop
flavor
ruins
the
drinkability
i
had
a
really
enjoyable
beer
here
i
was
lucky
to
score
it
as
part
of
a
12pack
lieneys
sampler
case
for
9
99
i
would
seek
itbeer
out
again
in
the
future
especially
for
a
price
in
that
range
pours
a
nice
amber
color
head
quickly
went
into
a
weak
lace
has
a
strong
lager
smell
lots
of
carbination
light
mouthfeel
has
a
bit
of
a
spicefriut
flavor
that
was
intresting
bit
of
a
edge
to
the
finish
one
of
those
beers
that
you
might
try
once
and
a
while
but
not
run
out
to
buy
drinkability
this
is
a
rich
enough
dunkel
without
being
too
heavy
this
makes
a
nice
session
brew
reccomeded
espescially
if
youre
in
search
of
a
tasty
beer
on
a
budget
im
not
saying
this
is
a
great
beer
but
i
surely
think
its
better
than
the
average
reviewer
here
will
admit
im
able
to
score
this
consistantly
for
8
47
per
12pack
so
im
also
slightly
partial
for
the
amazing
value
it
pours
as
many
average
beers
pour
has
a
reddish
hue
of
course
very
thin
and
clear
it
has
a
nicely
balanced
malty
character
which
actually
gives
it
some
flavor
unlike
some
of
leinie
reds
other
family
members
nothing
challenging
nothing
groundbreaking
but
cmon
were
talking
about
a
viennastyle
lager
here
and
a
pleasantly
drinkable
one
at
that
eh
that
is
how
i
feel
about
this
beer
its
apperance
is
average
red
like
i
would
expect
from
an
irish
red
nothing
really
stands
out
from
the
flavor
except
that
its
body
is
watery
the
finish
is
crisp
and
clean
but
leaves
you
desiring
something
same
goes
for
the
drinkability
you
can
drink
it
but
after
awhile
i
forgot
that
i
was
drinking
a
beer
i
tasted
this
beer
and
many
others
on
the
ss
badger
ferry
boat
traveling
from
michigan
to
wisconsin
although
it
was
served
in
a
plastic
cup
which
lowered
it
appearance
and
possibly
it
aroma
scores
i
found
this
to
be
a
very
drinkable
offering
poured
a
crystal
clear
red
with
a
slight
grassiness
to
the
otherwise
malty
nose
nice
flavor
with
slight
roasty
notes
the
body
is
crisp
and
sweet
the
finish
is
dry
and
short
nothing
special
but
easy
to
drink
a
cult
favorite
this
beer
is
really
popular
in
wisconsin
where
i
lived
for
a
while
the
appearance
is
translucent
copper
in
color
a
nice
sized
head
of
foam
head
that
lasts
a
good
while
and
leaves
some
lace
aroma
contains
medicinal
herbs
malt
and
dextrose

resulting
in
a
sharp
experience
on
the
tongue
that
gradually
mellows
the
body
is
medium
dry
on
the
palate
and
leaves
a
slightly
unpleasant
aftertaste

and
not
much
desire
to
repeat
the
experience
clear
amber
pour
with
a
moderate
head
not
much
lacing
aroma
is
of
caramel
and
a
little
weak
taste
has
that
caramel
malty
sweetness
in
it
and
some
euro
style
hops
seem
to
be
there
as
well
but
theyre
a
bit
on
the
weak
side
finish
is
momentary
and
forgetable
nothing
inspirational
here
but
nothing
to
scoff
at
either
just
a
simply
somewhat
decent
beer
that
could
easily
be
sessioned
given
the
flavor
alcohol
content
thinnish
body
and
most
importantly
price
worth
a
try
the
beer
poured
a
rich
amber
with
a
nice
tan
head
the
presentation
left
you
saying
now
thats
what
a
beer
should
look
like
the
aroma
was
of
sweet
malt
the
taste
was
big
malt
taste
with
just
the
right
hop
finish
the
feel
was
medium
and
creamy
i
happened
to
find
myself
in
a
bennigans
in
elgin
il
and
looking
through
the
taps
i
saw
this
one
being
the
only
beer
i
hadnt
heard
of
i
had
to
taste
it
i
had
gone
through
two
before
i
knew
it
i
had
to
think
long
and
hard
before
getting
a
hackerpschorr
hw
for
the
finale
i
was
quite
impressed
and
cant
wait
to
get
back
and
sample
this
fine
beer
again
12
ounce
bottle
this
beer
has
a
clear
amber
color
with
a
medium
sized
head
the
aroma
is
sweet
malty
and
just
a
little
fruity
the
flavor
starts
out
caramel
sweet
there
are
some
fruity
berry
flavors
the
finish
is
hoppy
and
bitter
but
there
is
an
offflavor
in
the
finish
like
soap
light
to
medium
mouthfeel
i
thought
this
beer
was
ok
not
flavorless
like
other
reviewers
have
described
it
but
still
not
a
great
beer
pours
a
ruby
amber
color
with
an
average
looking
head
that
doesnt
last
very
long
it
has
a
strong
red
hop
smell
paired
with
carmelized
malts
it
tastes
great
has
a
nice
bite
to
it
but
not
too
overpowering
this
one
could
definitly
hold
its
own
against
counterparts
like
killians
or
smithwicks
the
mouthfeel
is
almost
creamy
not
heavybodied
by
any
means
but
not
too
thin
either
very
nice
job
on
this
one
one
of
my
favorites
dark
reddish
amber
with
an
offwhite
slightly
reddish
large
rocky
head
that
stayed
a
for
a
little
while
and
left
some
lacing
early
aroma
is
a
little
sweet
with
light
hops
and
mild
caramel
maltiness
over
a
bit
of
an
adjunct
stink
taste
is
grainy
and
bland
with
a
short
slightly
bitter
finish
not
bad
really
but
nothing
really
noteworthy
thin
body
watery
texture
average
carbonation
nothing
special
but
still
enjoyable
for
what
it
is
a
reasonablypriced
break
from
the
norm
the
beer
pours
a
reddishamber
color
with
a
14
offwhite
head
that
quickly
fades
to
lacing
the
aroma
is
decent
it
has
a
dry
lager
yeast
scent
along
with
a
weak
caramel
malt
aroma
it
smells
like
a
weaker
killians
the
taste
is
decent
also
it
has
a
sweet
caramel
malt
flavor
that
goes
down
easy
and
finishes
dry
and
grainy
it
has
a
bit
of
an
aftertaste
that
lingers
its
a
bit
musty
and
bitter
the
mouthfeel
is
average
it
is
a
low
bodied
beer
with
good
carbonation
this
is
an
average
drinking
red
lager
it
is
weak
in
aroma
and
taste
as
well
as
mouthfeel
its
one
and
done
for
me
i
dont
agree
with
this
beer
beign
classified
as
a
munich
dunkel
lager
i
looked
back
at
my
reviews
and
this
beer
is
far
from
any
of
those
color
is
red
with
a
small
creamy
offwhite
head
smells
slightly
sweet
and
carmely
not
very
strong
taste
is
also
very
light
and
creamy
light
grassy
malts
and
slight
sweetness
maybe
this
is
a
munich
dunkel
but
who
cares
it
is
an
unimpressive
underpowered
beer
in
any
sense
of
the
word
yet
another
bottle
of
cheap
wisconsin
beer
unfortunately
the
appearance
is
very
unimpressive
there
was
some
head
but
the
beer
itself
looked
watery
with
very
little
lace
the
smell
was
almost
nonexistance
other
than
a
slightly
unpleasant
odor
tastewise
is
was
undrinkable
watery
sour
not
in
a
good
hops
sour
way
either
with
little
taste
what
so
ever
except
for
an
after
taste
that
made
you
want
to
dump
out
the
rest
of
the
beer
which
is
exactly
what
i
did
i
dont
recommend
this
to
anyone
this
beer
was
drinkable
but
it
didnt
do
a
whole
lot
for
me
this
is
in
the
same
vein
as
killians
but
that
seems
to
have
more
flavor
than
this
brew
i
could
take
or
leave
this
red
beer
a
pleasant
and
inexpensive
beer
a
good
everyday
type
beer
drinkability
its
a
relatively
thin
sweet
smooth
beer
thats
can
be
drank
in
succession
the
attractive
price
and
good
drinkability
make
this
beer
one
id
definitely
recommend
anyone
try
pours
light
amber

some
nice

not

lightly

slight

not
really
much
going
on
with
this
one
another
middle
of
the
road
slightly
better
then
macros
brew
from
leiny
pass
it
by
youwe
can
do
better
then
this
limp
and
lame
stuff
good
red
color
but
the
cap
seemed
loose
no
off
tastes
easily
the
best
leinie
ive
tried
so
far
with
a
bustling
white
head
that
lasts
briefly
no

tough
to
pick
out
any

some

always
has

for

99
or
less
a

its

in

the

is

for
which
we
should
all
be
grateful
this
was
a
pretty
good
beer
a
nice

with
a
decent
head
on

of
it
it
had
a
nice
matly
taste
with
some
hops
to
back
it
up
the
mouthfeel
was
light
but
it
had
a
great
consitensy
and
great
carbonation
definitely
a
beer
to
get
when
you
dont
know
what
to
get
tried
this
on

recently
not
much
to
say
deep
red
color
with
a
tired
shortlived

aroma
is
mostly

but
not
a

foretaste

theres
just
not

thats

odd
malt
aroma
mouthfeel
is
thin

fizzy
taste
consists
of
lightly
toasted

with
some
hints
of
caramel
the
finish
has
an
unpleasant
grainy
texture
and
flavor
to
it
i
dont
even
think
id
reccommend
this
vs
other
macro
reds
such
as
killians
pours
an
average
red
color
with
some
head
but
it
didnt
last
though
that
may
have
been
from
my
glass
not
much
of
a
smell
to
it
just
average
beer
smell
that
my
dorm
smelled
like
last
year
pretty
good
tastenot
too
extordinary
in
any
way
but
it
goes
down
easy
and
enjoyable
so
id
recomend
it
if
youre
looking
to
save
a
couple
bucks
and
have
a
halfway
decent
beer
this
brew
poured
a
medium
sized
white
head
of
fine
to
large
bubbles
and
left
no
lacing
as
it
receded
it
has
a
very
mild
malty
aroma
and
a
transparent
light
brown
body
with
carbonation
there
is
a
slight
initial
bite
in
the
flavor
and
it
is
a
bit
fizzy
there
is
a
typical
red
flavor
to
it
that
i
cant
put
into
words
this
is
a
nice
brew
but
nothing
to
write
home
about
color
is
a
nice
dark
amberish
brown
tinted
thin
crowned
glass
of
loose
yogurtlike
offwhite
head
some
lacing
begins
to
stick
in
spots
as
it
becomes
consumed
smell
is
nearly
nonexistent
a
barely
there
sweet
sense
of
malt
and
maybe
corn
grain
taste
is
limpid
sweet
malts
unbalanced
approach
in
light
floral

it
has
some
corn

thinner

but
not
by
much
in
some
standards
of
how
this
style
is
suppose
to
be
needs
a
boost
in
every
aspect
and
im
suspect
of
the
color
that
too
may
be
artificial
as
in
coloring
deep
auburn
brown
medium
head
quickly
fading
unexpected
fruity
aroma
smooth
and
delicate
taste
however
finishes
with
an
acidic
bitterness
which
lingers
traces
of
hops
but
just
a
tad
linnys
is
again
close
to
a
good
beer
but
their
constant
attempt
to
distinguish
themselves
with
their
unique
taste
leaves
this
beer
in
a
class
by
itself
unfortunatly
it
is
a
class
i
prefer
not
to
frequent
recomended
this
beer
poured
a
ruby
amber
orange
color
head
was
large
and
dense
beer
has
a
pungent
grain
and
malt
aroma
very
light
in
body
almost
watery
with
not
much
body
has
a
breadiness
to
it
yeasty
dough
with
some
fruitiness
theres
a
hop
bitterness
there
too
this
is
an
easy
drinking
dry
and
fairly
tasty
lager
but
nothing
spectacular
taste
is
malty
sweet
but
isnt
very
complex
or
deep
its
pretty
drinkable
feels
a
little
heavy
in
the
mouth
lowers
drinkability
a
notch
but
still
a
decent
beer
this
brew
poured
a
medium
head
that
quickly
dissolved
there
was
no
lacing
on
the
sides
of
my
glass
it
had
a
nice
aroma
to
it
there
was
carbonation
in
this
brew
it
had
a
slight
bitter
taste
to
it
i
was
not
overly
impressed
with
this
particular
brew
a
reasonably
solid
red
lager
creamy
head
medium
to
thin
bodied
big
malty
flavor
but
more
or
less
straight
forward
and
not
terribly
exciting
no
real
balance
to
the
beer
as
it
just
has
a
wet
malty
taste
through
the
finish
its
ok
but
theres
nothing
standout
about
this
beer
from
cracking
the
bottle
to
the
last
sip
not
a
bad
beer
to
use
as
a
party
brew
pretty
cheap
and
probably
better
than
most
things
that
a
lot
of
folks
have
lying
around
looks
can
be
deceiving
i
really
like
the
look
of
leinies
labeling
this
being
a
nicely
done
red
an
added
bonus
was
the
initial
look
of
this
pour
that
was
very
appealing
a
great
deep
amber
with
traces
of
red
and
very
well
formed
tan
head
some
retention
and
very
light
lacing
first
hint
of
trouble
came
from
the
aroma
or
lack
thereof
since
this
has
little
nose
some
light
malting
and
small
sense
of
hops
flavor
of
malt
was
only
slightly
balanced
worse
was
an
odd
husk
flavor
and
over
use
of
adjuncts
oddly
chemicallike
as
the
beer
warmed
almost
a
lacquer
sense
not
enjoyable
to
finish
i
probably
trusted
this
beer
too
much
and
should
have
had
it
more
deeply
chilled
if
they
could
reduce
the
chemicaladjunct
presence
this
would
be
a
much
better
beer
still
sometimes
this
is
the
best
beer
some
nonbeer
bars
in
the
midwest
carry
notes
a
bit
odd
for
a
red
beer
this
would
be
confused
for
a
simple
lager
this
beer
lacks
body
leinies
red
is
solid
enough
to
stand
on
its
own
merits
loses
points
for
a
fully
diminishing
head
malty
yet
wellbalanced
unfortunately
for
this
label
but
fortunately
for
beer
lovers
the
red
pseudostyle
fad
is
behind
us
could
have
more
carbonation
better
tasting
than
most
of
the
reds
i
sought
this
brew
out
for
the
bottle
was
a
135th
anniversary
so
if
i
were
to
try
it
nows
the
time
it
poured
a
beautiful
red
color
with
a
massive
offwhite
head
that
settled
to
a
full
coverage
film
lace
is
good
for
the
first
half
of
the
brew
the
aroma
is
of
slight
barley
malt
and
a
note
of
sourness
the
taste
is
the
same
with
the
mouth
left
tart
the
body
of
this
brew
is
weak
for
after
about
15
min
the
brew
waters
down
other
bas
have
said
dont
let
it
sit
and
i
agree
also
colder
is
better
for
a
crisp
start
for
thisone
mine
was
55
and
could
of
helped
with
10
cooler
i
will
buy
this
again
around
thankgiving
for
a
nonpumpkin
autumn
offering
indian
labeled
bottle
it
has
been
a
while
since
i
had
one
of
these
pours
a
redamber
color
with
a
minimal
head
that
fades
to
nothing
fast
left
just
an
island
of
flat
head
floating
in
the
center
of
my
glass
deep
malty
aroma
sweet
with
a
faint
scent
of
mollasses
taste
is
more
bitter
than
i
thought
it
would
be
since
i
didnt
really
smell
a
lot
of
hop
presence
where
are
the
malts
i
smelled
this
beer
just
doesnt
seem
rightalmost
sour
i
wont
be
drinking
this
again
anytime
soon
tasts
average
pretty
sweet
an
little
bitterness
a
thin
mouthfeel
with
a
little
carbonation
sting
on
the
tounge
i
consider
this
a
pretty
good
red
lager
the
color
is
a
nice
dark
amber
with
average
head
the
smell
and
taste
are
mostly
malty
with
the
hops
taking
a
far
backseat
i
enjoy
this
beer
but
it
seems
a
little
too
thin
i
think
killians
does
this
style
better
beautiful
amber
color
which
pours
out
a
thin
head
slight
malty
nose
with
a
hint
of
hoppiness
the
malt
flavor
is
pretty
thin
leaving
me
with
a
watery
aftertaste
it
slides
down
pretty
good
but
so
does
water
ive
had
all
the
brews
from
leinies
before
and
upon
revisiting
a
couple
of
them
i
remember
why
i
waited
so
long
to
review
them
because
they
suck
i
decided
to
give
this
beer
a
second
try
and
yes
i
did
like
it
better
this
goaround
but
i
still
dont
find
it
outstanding
id
drink
it
again
without
complaining
bright
amber
very
red
color
indeed
pour
produces
a
thick
foamy
tan
head
not
much
noticable
smell
wise
some
decent
malt
smells
very
beer
like
taste
is
always
pleasant
to
me
malty
slighltly
thin
on
the
hops
but
very
decent
i
always
thought
it
was
a
amber
ale
not
a
dark
lager
that
shows
you
what
i
know
bigger
bodied
than
you
would
think
but
with
a
wierd
tongue
coating
slime
if
you
live
it
sit
too
long
i
havent
tried
the
others
in
the
leinekugel
line
but
i
would
give
them
a
try
i
used
to
drink
these
all
the
time
in
college
they
were
always
a
1
00
not
a
bad
beer
and
used
to
be
one
of
my
favorites
when
i
thought
this
was
microbrew
exotic
pale
red
in
color
with
almost
nonexistent
head
the
aroma
was
slightly
sweet
although
it
was
not
malt
more
of
a
corngrain
sweetness
the
flavor
was
more
of
the
same
with
slight
hops
appearing
at
the
end
of
the
flavor
to
give
the
lager
taste
from
leines
offerings
i
like
the
original
and
creamy
dark
better
not
a
bad
beer
for
a
change
from
the
macro
lagers
and
because
of
the
high
availability
can
be
found
at
most
of
the
same
places
for
the
same
price
leinenkugels
red
lager
is
not
a
watered
down
and
over
carbonated
red
beer
good
beer
taste
with
pleasant
mouth
feel
the
only
thing
i
would
want
more
of
is
alcohol
i
think
this
beer
is
a
bit
light
in
that
regard
i
liked
this
one
almost
as
much
as
killians
similar
color
and
flavor
but
this
one
seemed
a
little
more
carbonated
but
that
may
be
because
i
had
it
in
a
keg
if
i
was
having
a
leinie
i
would
take
the
creamy
dark
hands
down
a
long
enjoyable
evening
drinking
lenies
red
which
really
grew
on
me
over
the
course
of
the
night
it
is
reddish
with
a
nice
head
that
was
lost
fairly
quickly
this
had
the
malt
taste
that
is
typical
but
i
kept
noticing
an
assertive
hops
flavor
that
was
as
surprising
as
it
was
enjoyable
very
crisp
drinkable
and
refreshing
for
its
style
thanks
to
the
hops
light
red
in
hue
and
typically
clear
the
head
is
poorly
retained
leaving
an
unimpressive
and
thin
layer
odd
metallic
sharp
husky
grain
notes
in
aroma
the
hop
nose
is
paltry
tastewise
this
beer
is
expectedly
bland
but
there
are
no
outright
flaws
sugary
corn
sweetness
is
prominent
but
not
overbearing
theres
no
way
this
brew
is
all
barley
malt
its
very
thin
in
body
and
malt
flavors
are
lacking
that
being
said
this
is
the
epitomy
of
the
style
leinenkugels
red
is
bland
and
the
color
serves
only
for
asthetic
purposes
i
like
this
style
of
beerdrink
alot
of
this
on
tap
in
the
summer
just
as
good
as
killians
i
think
nothin
special
but
i
like
it
perfect
amber
color
with
a
frothy
white
head
that
has
some
retention
slight
caramel
malt
notes
detected
in
the
nose
pretty
clean
taste
just
a

musty

taste
is
negligible
nothing
distinctive
about
this
brew
tastes
like
a
macro
drink
better
leinies
try
hard
but
just
dont
seem
to
measure
up
try
a
creamy
dark
its
too
obvious
and
one
dimensional
in
its
chocolate
approach
the
red
is
the
same
a
little
tangy
and
granular
but
thin
overall
mouthfeel
suffers
the
most
a
winter
lager
that
they
used
to
do
was
one
of
their
best
real
spice
notes
brought
on
by
complexity
but
more
lately
they
seem
to
be
focusing
on
fewer
offerings
the
red
just
dissappears
off
your
tongue
just
a
basic
run
of
the
mill
red
not
a
lot
of
flavor
but
some
maltiness
tries
to
fight
its
way
out
easy
drinking
i
thought
this
was
better
than
killians
but
im
not
sure
right
now
its
not
bad
but
its
pretty
nondescript
creamy
finish
last
time
i
tried
it
i
thought
it
had
more
hopping
than
killians
and
a
unique
taste
i
get
very
little
hops
out
of
this
one
an
average
red
nothing
more
nothing
less
yawn
not
bad
if
the
choices
are
limited
itll
suffice
in
a
pinch
overall
iv
said
it
before
and
ill
say
it
again
great
lakes
makes
some
of
the
best
lagers
i
have
had
from
this
country
i
think
a
lot
craft
beer
enthusiasts
get
lost
in
the
double
and
imperial
beers
and
cant
appreciate
a
well
crafted
lager
for
what
this
is
its
pretty
amazing
and
the
benchmark
for
an
amber
lager
in
my
opinion
great
balance
between
malts
and
hops
yet
light
enough
so
you
know
its
a
lager
along
with
dortmunder
gold
this
is
my
go
to
lawn
mowing
bbq
lager
of
choice
thats
all
folks
overall
i
remember
why
i
fell
in
love
with
this
beer
my
first
microbrew
back
in
2002
perfectly
satisfying
interplay
between
malt
and
hops
with
a
slight
tilt
toward
malt
its
a
solid
reliable
favorite
that
i
will
return
to
again
and
again
although
perhaps
not
quite
true
to
style
great
example
of
what
an
amber
lager
should
be
like
slightly
hopped
and
with
some
pleasant
spicy
overtones
it
almost
makes
driving
to
west
virginia
where
i
got
it
worth
it
nice
head
as
well
despite
a
lousy
poor
on
my
part
good
stuff
here
by
far
the
most
complex
viennastyle
ive
ever
encountered
points
for
uniqueness
heavy
biscuit
on
the
front
leads
to
a
surprising
floralesque
finish
quite
boozy
for
the
style
at
6
2
abv
and
it
can
be
felt
as
the
beer
is
much
heavier
than
say
boston
lager
as
far
as
this
style
goes
i
wish
this
one
was
lightened
up
a
little
bit
all
in
all
it
is
a
fantastic
unique
beer
cheers
very
drinkable
beer
little
bit
of
malt
balance
with
a
spiced
dark
fig
finish
good
beer
always
inth
mix
pack
its
been
a
while
since
ive
had
the
eliot
ness
as
i
have
been
in
the
bubble
of
ipas
and
dipas
for
some
time
and
all
i
can
say
is
that
this
beer
put
a
huge
smile
on
my
face
and
delighted
my
taste
buds
this
is
sweet
and
candied
and
has
a
super
nice
perfume
like
finish
which
is
amazing
i
forgot
how
good
this
beer
is
and
how
nice
it
is
to
step
out
of
the
ipa
haze
and
appreciate
a
style
that
is
different
but
equally
satisfying
this
is
more
malty
and
is
not
very
bitter
a
very
delicious
beer
that
i
will
be
drinking
more
of
my
first
bee
and
a
beer
that
i
will
never
forget
a
strong
dark
taste
very
special
i
could
see
this
being
off
setting
for
light
beer
drinkers
but
if
you
want
a
full
on
dark
beer
look
no
further
this
is
a
solid
very
flavorful
lager
i
dont
particularly
like
the
mouthfeel
and
it
comes
across
a
little
dry
on
the
flavor
as
well
but
its
a
good
brew
to
pair
with
food
an
interesting
year
round
beer
from
glbc
overall
this
is
a
fantastic
lager
by
great
lakes
this
beer
definitely
doesnt
lack
on
flavor
and
is
one
you
can
drink
and
not
get
tired
of
ill
definitely
be
pickin
this
up
more
often
very
bitter
pale
aftertaste
good
amber
but
a
lot
better
out
there
clean
refreshing
and
flavorful
a
well
done
amber
lager
overall
a
fantastic
beer
looking
to
find
more
by
this
brewing
company
rich
clear
dark
amber
color
solid
head
retained
throughout
excellent
rich
malt
flavor
with
just
the
right
amount
of
hoppy
tang
an
excellent
lager
with
the
dortmunder
gold
a
very
close
runner
up
overall
a
little
bit
sweet
at
first
with
caramel
and
toffee
notes
hint
of
nut
flavor
solid
and
smooth
feel
to
it
just
a
really
good
brew
just
an
average
amber
ale
malty
sweet
with
caramel
after
the
initial
assault
of
grapefruit
hops
which
is
uncharacteristic
of
the
german
version
the
hop
settles
down
as
the
caramel
malt
and
sweetness
predominate
perhaps
this
should
be
a
new
style
americanized
vienna
lager
there
is
also
a
bitter
hop
note
in
the
finish
but
overall
an
excellent
example
of
the
style
as
a
fan
of
negra
modelo
and
dos
equis
i
had
to
try
this
based
on
the
glowing
reviews
here
at
ba
definitely
a
very
flavorful
beer
theres
a
lot
to
like
here
easily
one
of
the
best
lagers
i
have
ever
tried
another
great
beer
from
great
lakes
overall
just
an
awesome
example
of
what
an
american
brewed
vienna
lager
can
be
its
very
refreshing
but
still
complex
and
refeshing
you
have
no
idea
its
over
a
6abv
drinking
it
its
follows
german
purity
law
and
still
has
great
flavor
and
great
refeshment
just
a
really
good
brew
dark
redamber
in
color
caramelnutmalt

mild
bite
aftertaste
but
not
offensive
at
all
very
smooth
and
drinkable
goes
well
with
meat
and
potatoes
or
just
some
potato
chips
overall
quite
a
nice
beer
reminds
me
a
bit
of
a
good
german
lager
well
done
great
lakes
the
world
class
flavor
profile
is
intense
complex
and
a
masterpiece
in
balance
it
begins
with
creamy
blend
of
toffee
and
caramel
against
a
slight
sweetness
that
has
a
cracker
character
in
the
middle
a
nice
noble
hop
flavor
emerges
over
a
mild
bitterness
against
a
fading
bitterness
a
nice
spicy
hop
character
emerges
that
is
a
bit
tart
a
bit
clove
like
and
has
a
pepper
aspect
outstanding
the
finish
is
a
bit
dry
but
also
has
a
sweet
biscuit
component
a
slightly
tart
note
lingers
for
a
bit
over
a
receding
caramel
and
biscuit
sweetness
leaving
the
tongue
with
a
slight
pucker
overall
i
would
make
this
a
regular
in
my
fridge
to
offer
to
any
and
all
and
i
would
score
points
with
the
wife
too
iso
medium

a

and
im
not
crazy
about

my
next
goto

lager
try
this
if
you
havent
our
very
favorite
beer
among
beers
good
amber
lager
pretty
smooth
overall
crisp
clean
well
balanced
with
a
nice
mouthfeel
looks
beautiful
with
a
deep
amber
body
and
tan
head
no
suspended
yeast
or
floaties
makes
for
a
very
polished
look
scent
is
in
the
background
nothing
pronounced
other
than
a
malt
blend
taste
begins
with
mostly
malts
then
gives
way
to
hops
notes
of
red
apple
were
also
present
mouthfeel
is
soapy
and
carbonated
with
significant
and
a
surprising
amount
of
alcohol
warmth
for
a
6
2
abv
lager
overall
a
solid
anytime
beer
great
first
impression
with
great
lakes
what
yuengling
was
when
it
was
cool
overall
a
unique
and
memorable
lager
this
is
a
good
one
to
sip
on
as
it
is
not
super
light
but
has
plently
of
flavor
not
the
everyday
lager
for
sure
a
great
beer
to
try
to
divert
oneself
from
the
norm
another
great
lakes
home
run
i
prefer
their
dortmunder
gold
but
this
is
an
extremely
wellmade
and
clean
representation
of
a
vienna
lager
sweet
bready
malts
a
bit
of
honey
and
a
crisp
clean
finish
this
is
on
par
with
devils
backbones
vienna
o
very
good
crisp
lager
reminds
me
of
some
of
the
marzen
beers
overall
this
is
the
way
lagers
should
taste
the
macrobrews
obviously
have
nothing
on
this
i
was
very
impressed
with
it
overall
and
the
fact
that
it
was
on
draught
made
me
a
very
happy
man
i
would
definitely
get
this
again
and
probably
will
by
far
the
best
of
the
style
ive
ever
tasted
it
might
even
be
the
best
beer
ive
tasted
its
not
the
greatest
to
eat
with
due
to
its
complex
hoppiness
in
the
finish
loved
it
excellent
very
good
o

this
beer
is
what
really
opened
the
door
to
craft
beer
for
me
it
has
a
special
place
in
my
heart
it
made
me
realize
not
everything
is
bmc
swill
i
finally
decided
to
review
it
after
reviewing
100
other
beers
this
is
a
great
gateway
beer
for
bmc
drinkers
it
has
some
added
depth
and
complexity
while
not
being
scary
the
flavor
profile
is
nice
and
the
body
and
lack
of
presense
of
the
alcohol
make
it
a
great
lawn
mower
beer
overall
this
is
an
excellent
v
lager
probably
sets
the
bar
for
this
side
of
the
pond
a
very
fine
beer
another
winner
from
great
lakes
o
nothing
to
complain
about
very
good
overall
and
worth
buying
anytime
but
strong
for
me
at
over
6
abv
glbc
rocks
o
i
have
yet
to
encounter
another
vienna
lager
thats
comparable
to
this
one
its
virtually
everything
i
could
look
for
in
this
style
from
the
complex
malt
profile
to
the
slight
hop
presence
and
the
silken
mouthfeel
this
is
a
staple
of
my
beer
enjoyment
serving
type
bottle
o
excellent
take
on
the
style
as
i
would
expect
from
glbc
and
their
tradition
of
brewing
excellent
lagers
why
i
never
reviewed
this
before
im
not
sure
but
i
ought
to
get
around
to
reviewing
their
other
offerings
as
well

i
love
this
beer
it
brings
back
memories
as
this
was
one
of
my
early
transition
beers
into
the
craft
beer
world
classic
this
beer
is
pure
class
untouchable
deep
rustic
red
in
color
with
a
light
haze
poured
with
a
creamy
rich
offwhite
foam
that
left
a
ladder
of
sticky
lacings
on
the
glass
sweet
earthy
grain
and
light
herbal
hop
aromas
medium
bodied
with
rich
creamy
smooth
carbonation
and
a
crisp
light
tangy
hop
bite
near
the
end
sweet
toasted
caramel
malt
flavors
up

with
toffee
and
herbal

notes
into
the

earthy
crisp
hop
flavor
through
the
middle
that
transitions
back
to
sweet
caramel
and
toasted
malt
finished
cleanly
with
a
bready
very
sweeytoasted
malt
aftertaste
a
generally
neglected
and
underappreciated
style
that
leans
to
that
sweet
maltier
side
best
beer
of
its
style
this
side
of
vienna
overall
this
beer
is
good
and
better
than
most
in
its
category
but
it
really
isnt
anything
too
special
its
extremely
drinkable
but
there
are
beers
that
ought
to
satisfy
you
just
as
much

and
its

o
excellent
example
of
vienna
lager
this
is
a
really
nice
beer
for
general
drinking
thats
not
a
bad
thing
good
beer
i
think
ill
go
have
another
o
very
tasty
beer
i
would
pair
it
with
some
fried
chicken
and
waffles
overall
it
was
fair
but
for
a
similar
style
i
would
pick
yeungling
all
day
over
this
its
half
the
price
and
you
can
session
the
hell
out
of
them
to
me
a
lager
is
meant
to
be
consumed
in
quantity
maybe
they
were
shooting
for
quality
but
if
i
go
to
a
lager
its
a
warmhot
day
and
i
want
to
drink
at
least
a
six
pack
this
one
i
could
not
do
that
with
o
this
beer
has
it
it
just
seems
to
have
more
pizzazz
than
other
examples
of
the
style
basically
its
the
best
vienna
ive
ever
had
the
complexity
of
this
really
caught
me
off
guard
too
i
contemplated
buying
a
6pack
of
this
beer
and
honestly
i
really
should
have
this
one
bottle
i
got
isnt
enough
poured
a
deep
clear
amber
with
a
thick
creamy
white
head
the
head
has
great
retention
and
leaves
great
lacing
the
aroma
is
rich
and
malty
with
bread
and
burnt
sugar
the
taste
is
equally
rich
with
nice
caramel
malt
flavors
and
just
a
hint
of
hops
on
the
finish
it
has
a
great
mouthfeel

is

over

by

and
stouts
east
to
drink
lager
that
wont
offend
anyone
an
acceptable
amount
of
character
here
but
id
personally
prefer
a
bit
more
vibrancy
worth
checking
out
if
youre
in

that
wont

taste
is
definitely
sweet
with
everything
in
the
nose
but
a
slight
bit
of
bitterness
from
the
hops
that
i
didnt
notice
in
the
nose
mouthfeel
is
fairly
thin
as
one
would
expect
from
a
lager
overall
i
really
like
this
beer
definitely
one
of
the
better
lagers
i
have
tasted
in
a
long
time
overall
this
is
an
interesting
and
complex
lager
i
definitely
prefer
this
over
the
brewerys
dortmunder
gold
o
not
my
favorite
glbc
brew
but
a
great
solid
lager
poured
from
a
bottle
into
a
shaker
pint
the
beer
is
a
bright
vibrant
rich
amber
coloring
with
a
slow
flow
of
carbonation
bubbling
and
a
filmy
wispy
low
profile
offwhite
head
looks
fantastic
aromas
of
rich
caramel
and
nut
blended
and
balanced
very
well
roasted
notes
throughout
flavors
are
roast
forward
with
nut
and
toffee
all
over
the
forward
tongue
subtle
hops
bitterness
in
the
tail
end
of
the
palate
with
an
overall
tangy
sweet
feel
the
aftertaste
is
roasted
and
tangy
sweet
with
highlights
of
sugary
caramel
smooth
light
and
slightly
crisp
body
with
a
slight
cloying
linger
in
an
otherwise
clean
finish
great
beer
that
is
not
to
say
this
is
a
bad
beer
i
find
it
less
bitter
than
some
amber
beers
ive
had
although
they
may
be
more
ales
in
comparing
this
to
devils
backbone
version
of
a
vienna
lager
i
enjoyed
db
slightly
better
granted
i
had
the
db
from
tap
not
bottle
and
sadly
didnt
rate
here
to
compare
in
both
cases
i
think
the
complexity
is
minimal
which
might
make
these
beers
more
appealing
to
a
larger
crowd
full
bodied
flavor
really
lingers
nicely
for
a
while
great
carbonation
level
and
not
really
much
of
a
bite
anywhere
starts
smooth
with
a
subtle
bite
at
the
finish
great
drinkability
on
this
one
this
is
something
any
beer
lover
could
regularly
have
in
their
fridge
i
understand
why
this
is
a
year
round
brew
from
great
lakes
great
beer
on
in
what
my
opinion
is
a
fairly
under
appreciated
style
overall
another
great
brew
from
great
lakes
full
of
flavor
and
does
not
disappoint
a
first
class
lager
maybe
the
best
i
have
about
8
types
of
lagers
in
my
fridge
and
i
think
the
others
will
have
to
wait
great
lakes
hit
it
perfect
over
all
i
enjoyed
this
lager
and
would
drink
it
again
overall
this
is
another
excellent
beer
from
grate
lakes
i
love
the
perfect
balance
between
the
malt
and
the
hops
medium
plus
body
very
light
effervescence
slightly
warming
late
a
little
drying
as
well
good
brew
the
taste
is
great
a
good
bready
quality
which
has
the
toastiness
of
vienna
malt
with
a
slight
flavor
of
caramel
backing
and
the
malt
is
balanced
well
by
an
herbal
hop
flavor
the
sweetness
is
a
little
more
noticeable
than
when
i
tried
this
on
draft
but
i
didnt
check
the
bottled
on
date
either
i
like
this
beer
a
lot
it
is
perfect
for
a
single
beer
to
sip
or
for
pairing
with
food
a
very
good
representation
of
the
style
with
plenty
of
flavor
pours
a
dark
brownmahogany
color
with
a
foamy
offwhite
head
that
stays
for
a
while
slight
amount
of
lacing
is
left
behind
sweet
smell
of
malt
raisins
molasses
really
nice
taste
is
also
slightly
sweet
with
a
raisin
aftertaste
very
robust
and
thick
but
still
easy
to
drink
could
see
this
as
a
great
thanksgiving
brew

this
was

was

slight

tinted
in
color
and
once
it
settles
it
leaves
a
good
solid
quarter
inch
and
little
bits
of
lace

aroma
has
that
yummy
vienna
lager
grainy
chewy
caramelly
scent
that
i
always
like
light
czech
hops
add
a
refreshing
edge
to
it
taste
is
smooth
with
toasty
roasty
and
nutty
grains
and
carbonation
is
fine
and
prickly
nice
balance
between
bitter
and
flavoraroma
hops
too
mouthfeel
is
sliiightly
chewy
and
mostly
slick
with
a
touch
of
grainy
texture
nice
array
of
textures
overall
i
like
this
i
would
be
happy
to
have
several
more
great
session
beer
o
a
very
tasty
beer
i
was
surprised
at
how
much
i
liked
it
but
not
really
sure
why
i
was
surprised
that
is
another
solid
beer
from
great
lakes
extremely
easy
drinking
pours
a
clear
reddish
amber

a
frothy
lasting

with
some

mediumlight
and
slightly
creamy
another
pleasant
lager
from
great
lakes
o
very
unique
there
is
a
level
of
deepness
to
this
beer
that
is
just
terrific
and
i
feel
as
though
i
didnt
capture
all
there
is
to
capture
in
this
one
this
is
a
really
good
beer
very
sessionable
just
all
around
a
real
pleasure
i
definitely
like
this
better
than
the
dortmund
which
is
not
to
say
the
dortmunder
is
not
a
very
good
beer
i
like
the
maltiness
that
comes
through
on
the
ness
i
know
that
this
beer
is
often
compared
to
sam
adams
boston
lager
i
drink
boston
lager
by
the
yard
but
i
think
this
might
be
a
little
better
at
6
2
abv
this
one
could
sneak
up
on
you
and
take
you
down
pretty
easily
o
a
really
good
beer
that
i
would
love
to
taste
at
the
brewery
as
i
bet
its
a
knockout
fresh
a
really
stout
malty
body
with
a
great
balance
of
sweetness
and
noble
hopping
i
poured
this
beer
into
a
pint
glass
it
has
a
amber
color
body
with
a
nice
foamy
head
that
retains
quite
long
the
smell
is
nice
and
malty
with
some
spice
the
taste
is
like
the
smell
malty
sweet
i
taste
a
little
spice
and
some
hops
the
mouth
feel
is
nice
and
smooth
and
goes
down
very
easy
overall
this
beer
is
great
o
a
good
beer
and
a
shining
example
of
the
style
recommended
poured
from
a
12oz
bottle
into
a
snifter
pours
a
very
clear
amber
color
its
looks
remind
me
of
a
red
ale
about
a
finger
of
a
creamy
off
white
head
sweet
caramel
malt
really
stands
out
in
the
nose
lots
of
sugar
and
a
small
amount
of
hops
also
come
through
taste
is
mainly
sweet
malt
reminds
me
a
lot
of
an
overly
sugary
fruit
punch
light
bodied
with
a
low
level
of
carbonation
an
interesting
lager
but
not
my
kind
of
beer
o
an
awesome
example
of
the
style
and
its
very
easy
to
drink
o
i
was
really
surprised
by
how
good
this
lager
is
the
number
one
rated
vienna
lager
for
a
reason
o
the
beer
is
very
easy
to
drink
and
goes
down
smoothly
pours
a
copperamber
with
some
offwhite
head
that
falls
to
some
bubbles
and
a
bit
of
foam
some
sediment
in
the
body
nose
hold
some
bread
cracker
light
caramel
malt
and
light
hop
character
some
slight
red
apple
notes
taste
is
crisp
initially
with
a
good
hop
bite
some
fresh
bread
a
solid
pale
malt
base
slight
grassiness
good
clean
and
refreshing
feel
with
a
moderate
lingering
bitterness
on
point
for
a
vienna
lager
just
how
i
like
em
absolutely
crushable
o
yet
another
wonderful
beer
from
great
lakes
this
brewery
exudes
quality
and
good
taste
gotta
try
this
again
and
again
i
think
i
rushed
through
this
most
recent
sipping
too
good
o
really
excellent
beer
very
sessionable
plenty
of
interest
great
lakes
hits
another
4bagger
drinkability
high
quality
lager
that
one
can
definitely
appreciate
with
a
higher
than
usual
abv
for
a
lager
to
go
with
it
very
onpoint
i
am
not
the
biggest
glbc
fan
but
this
is
perfection
bravo
all
that
being
said
this
is
perhaps
the
best
lager
i
have
ever
had
o
really
nice
beer
and
one
that
i
would
pick
over
yuengling
anyday
in
a
bar
cant
believe
i
just
said
that
refreshing
while
giving
you
a
clean
malt
bill
that
makes
this
a
solid
beer
with
all
the
great
reviews
on
this
beer
i
expected
more
from
it
to
me
and
my
probably
undeveloped
tastes
this
was
nothing
spectacular
its
good
for
sure
but
nothing
i
would
rave
about
the
appearance
was
for
me
the
best
part
as
it
pour
a
deep
amber
and
white
head
poured
clear
reddishbrown
with
a
small
white
head
caramel
maltiness
aroma
with
some
light
nuttiness
simply
caramel
malt
smoothness
in
the
taste
with
a
hint
of
light
hops
for
balance
bready
with
just
a
touch
of
fresh
cut
grass
lightmedium
body
and
easily
drinkable
overall
a
fantastic
broodworthy
beer
a
very
hearty
lager
ah
pours
a
clean
brownish
red
with
a
2
finger
head
that
lays
on
top
of
the
glass
and
almost
looks
like
cream
as
it
slimes
to
the
side
walls
this
fuckers
got
a
big
lager
scent
with
a
note
of
spice
caramel
malts
bready
alcohol
cloves
ginger
and
a
wiff
of
bittering
hops
on
the
end
sweet
and
smooth
caramel
on
the
tongue
again
with
the
breadiness
nuts
and
whole
grains
sweet
throughout
the
whole
sip
until
the
end
then
the
hops
come
into
play
and
give
a
big
biterness
on
the
finish
that
would
otherwise
go
unoticed
hearty
but
not
too
much
about
a
medium
feel
maybe
a
light
to
some
medium
carbonation
that
tickles
the
tongue
and
dry
on
the
finish
pairs
fantastic
with
a
big
dead
animal
on
your
plate
what
can
i
say
great
lakes
cant
lose
and
this
is
a
home
run
cheers
final
note
unfortunately
i
cant
give
this
5s
across
the
board
due
to
the
slightly
unbalanced
flavor
profile
which
might
benefit
from
a
slightly
heavier
dose
of
hops
but
its
damn
close
to
perfect
grab
this
whenever
you
see
it
available
overall
its
good
very
nice
and
easy
drinking
overall
nice
lager
at
a
nice
price
call
me
crazy
but
i
think
i
would
take
a
boston
lager
over
this
taste
is
malty
with
some
toffee
tones
up
front
and
a
hoppy
twang
at
the
finish
enjoyable
very
sam
adams
lager
like
with
much
bolder
flavors
also
more
malty
and
less
hoppy
than
sa
lager
but
overall
just
fantastic
and
the
best
vienna
lager
ive
ever
had
draft
to
imperial
pint
glass
looks
good
amber
with
malty
expectations
smell
is
its
weakest
asset
its
almost
nonexistent
tastes
good
malty
yet
crisp
goes
down
nicely
could
make
for
a
good
session
beer
i
enjoyed
it
overall
although
i
prefer
more
of
a
bitter
beer
in
general
think
of
it
as
killians
on
steroids
very
nice
beer
and
an
outstanding
example
of
the
vienna
lager
style
ill
admit
im
a
fan
of
sam
adams
this
is
a
nice
alternative
an
excellent
beer
easy
to
drink
and
easy
to
enjoy
ill
buy
this
again
it
would
go
perfectly
with
pizza
pasta
chicken
just
about
anything
o
very
high
drinkability
yet
another
excellent
great
lakes
beer
o
a
great
beer
i
really
enjoyed
it
i
could
easily
session
this
beer
o
to
me
this
beer
is
what
the
big
companies
wish
they
could
make
light
refreshing
tasty
and
highly
drinkable
worth
a
try
and
a
great
beer
for
lounging
around
during
the
warmer
months
this
is
more
enjoyable
to
me
than
sa
boston
lager
very
solid
all
around
pours
a
dark
orangish
red
with
just
a
little
bit
of
foam
in
the
sam
adams
perfect
pint
glass
tastes
of
slightly
sweet
caramal
malts
with
a
breadie
like
finish
for
a
lager
im
not
used
to
having
one
that
doesnt
have
a
bad
aftertaste
this
is
quite
drinkable
wish
lagers
like
great
lakes
were
availabe
here
overall
a
very
good
version
of
a
lager
o
i
was
really
impressed
by
this
beer
im
not
the
hugest
fan
of
boston
lager
so
i
didnt
have
high
hopes
for
this
one
but
i
must
say
that
i
would
drink
this
often
if
it
was
available
to
me
thanks
again
jay
for
a
great
brew
o
this
is
one
of
the
best
lagers
ive
ever
had
absolutely
delicious
and
a
joy
to
drink
cant
go
wrong
with
this
beer
o
overall
a
pretty
good
example
of
the
style
and
a
good
beer
for
when
you
dont
want
something
extremely
heavy
or
light
m
smooth
nice
carbonation
with
a
little
bite
very
pleasant
very
enjoyable
beer
just
like
pretty
much
everything
else
made
by
great
lakes
ive
been
drinking
this
for
years
and
i
wont
stop
any
time
soon
pours
a
clear
reddish
orange
one
finger
of
offwhite
head
spotty
lacing
smell
toffee
buttery
lightly
toasty
with
a
light
floral
hopping
taste
toffee
toasted
grain
a
little
fruity
yeast
not
as
clean
as
expected
fairly
sweet
with
light
floral
and
grassy
hopping
not
special
but
works
for
the
style
best
by
5711
this
one
lets
the
balance
of
malt
to
hops
stand
out
no
hop
aroma
tastes
like
crystal
4060l
good
beer
all
around
its
hard
to
get
excited
about
standard
issued
lagers
if
it
was
a
marzen
then
maybe
i
could
talk
about
the
history
or
the
amount
of
time
and
craftsmenship
that
went
into
making
it
or
how
all
the
malts
create
this
perfectly
smooth
sweet
complex
brew
this
isnt
a
bad
beer
and
as
far
as
lagers
go
it
is
everything
im
looking
for
pours
smooth
amber
color
with
white
head
sweet
flavor
and
clean
finish
and
when
it
was
done
i
ordered
something
more
exciting
burning
river
i
would
say
this
is
a
good
transition
beer
when
youre
going
from
one
style
to
the
other
like
going
from
porter
to
ipa
i
like
great
lakes
as
a
brewery
and
im
really
impressed
with
the
diversity
of
the
styles
they
release
and
the
quality
of
each
beer
ive
tried
some
of
those
styles
like
american
pale
ale
i
point
to
great
lakes
as
a
gold
standard
example
burning
river
so
its
hard
to
get
worked
up
over
eliot
ness
because
great
lakes
has
so
many
other
beers
that
are
better
o
goes
down
easily
tasty
not
too
filling
mild
kick
nice
representation
of
style
as
my
palate
has
changed
this
would
be
a
one
and
done
for
me
but
those
enjoying
a
sweeter
beer
this
is
easily
one
to
sit
with
for
a
long
time
when
we
first
tried
this
beer
years
ago
a
buddy
of
mine
made
it
seem
that
he
was
among
the
untouchables
as
well
in
that
you
couldnt
bribe
him
enough
to
willingly
drink
this
again
lets
see
if
my
tastebuds
have
evolved
since
then
this
stuff
pours
a
clear
copperamber
topped
by
a
halffinger
of
offwhite
foam
the
nose
comprises
caramel
toffee
and
some
very
mild
and
light
orange
zest
the
taste
brings
the
orange
forward
mostly
in
terms
of
the
peel
with
the
caramel
and
toffee
coming
in
later
in
the
end
though
is
a
short
but
sharp
stab
of
harsh
bitterness
this
is
probably
what
turned
my
buddy
and
me
off
so
long
ago
and
not
much
has
changed
though
my
reaction
now
is
decidedly
less
vitriolic
the
body
is
a
light
medium
with
a
light
moderate
carbonation
and
a
sorta
dryish
finish
overall
an
okay
brew
but
not
something
i
really
wanna
go
for
again
pours
a
clear
amber
red
with
a
thin
bubbly
light
tan
head
nice
looking
body
semi
lacking
head
nose
is
sweet
hops
some
caramel
malt
and
bread
taste
is
similiar
to
the
smell
good
balance
between
the
hops
and
other
classic
ingrediants
very
well
crafted
medium
bodied
mouthfeel
a
real
easy
drinking
ale
great
balance
of
the
abv
smooth
tasty
and
enjoyable
a
deserving
and
well
made
beer
very
drinkable
beer
a
nice
smooth
lager
not
my
favorite
from
great
lakes
however
it
was
an
enjoyable
beer
over
dinner
doesnt
do
much
for
me
decent
alcohol
but
thats
about
it
i
just
dont
care
for
lagers
and
this
one
is
nothing
special
overall
this
is
a
great
session
ale
if
your
looking
for
something
for
the
long
haul
or
this
would
definitely
go
well
with
summer
grillables
this
was
a
very
simple
down
to
the
basics
type
of
brew
for
a
vienneamber
lager
this
was
chalked
full
of
flavor
there
was
a
caramel
toasted
malt
flavor
but
it
wasnt
so
over
powering
as
to
distract
from
the
hops
the
hops
lent
a
slight
bitterness
and
dryness
that
gave
this
beer
a
great
balance
like
many
beers
from
great
lakes
this
one
would
be
a
solid
choice
for
any
occasion
d
yet
another
excellent
beer
from
great
lakes
this
brewery
definitely
knows
how
to
make
their
lagers
this
is
an
excellent
example
of
a
vienna
style
lager
lots
of
malt
flavor
but
at
the
same
time
restrained
enough
to
be
very
drinkable
one
of
the
best
examples
for
the
style
a
must
try
if
you
like
good
lagers
excellent
thanks
to
radioscooter
for
the
sample
d
solid
beer
from
great
lakes
im
enjoying
this
one
more
after
revisiting
it
a
couple
of
times
i
had
this
bottle
from
a
12pack
sampler
that
i
bought
to
revisit
some
of
their
beers
but
its
tempting
me
to
try
this
on
tap
when
i
get
a
chance
if
youre
looking
for
a
beer
with
strong
malt
flavors
that
isnt
too
sweet
this
ones
a
great
bet
i
dont
generally
like
lagers
with
a
few
exceptions
but
this
beer
really
wowed
me
and
will
definitely
become
a
staple
for
me
its
a
wonderful
golden
amber
lager
very
refreshing
with
a
smooth
but
sparkly
mouthfeel
flavor
is
mellow
but
surprisingly
complex
clean
crisp
and
malty
almost
perfectly
balanced
simply
delicious
a
fantastic
summer
session
beer
pours
a
rich
amber
color
with
an
impressive
white
head
has
a
malted
aroma
almost
like
a
killians
irish
red
on
steroids
both
being
vienna
lagers
has
nice
carbonation
and
a
good
mouth
feel
taste
is
remarkable
goes
down
smooth
id
recommend
this
beer
id
like
to
go
have
it
on
tap
straight
from
the
brewpub
i
would
absolutely
buy
a
12
pack
and
great
lakes
has
proven
to
make
very
tasty
beers
at
an
affordable
price
d
this
was
a
delicious
and
crisp
vienna
lager
but
has
a
slight
bitter
aftertaste
but
not
as
bad
as
other
viennas
ive
had
the
alcohol
is
well
hidden
in
this
lager
would
be
exceptional
in
the
summer
and
in
the
heat
though
admittedly
dangerous
with
the
6
2
abv
d
very
nice
offering
i
have
to
be
honest
i
tried
a
bottle
previous
to
this
review
and
it
was
off
im
not
sure
if
it
was
coded
or
just
a
bad
seal
or
what
but
im
happy
i
tried
again
solid
brew
verdict
i
have
had
this
beer
a
couple
times
before
and
have
not
once
been
disappointed
with
it
my
favorite
beer
from
great
lakes
very
tasty
beer
exceptional
color
and
smell
and
pretty
easy
to
drink
despite
its
slightly
heavier
appearance
i
would
definitely
recommend
this
beer
to
even
a
casual
beer
drinker
welling
to
expand
their
beer
horizons
and
try
something
different
and
interesting
probably
1920
beers
i
have
are
ales
and
eliot
ness
is
a
pleasant
reminder
that
theres
something
to
be
said
for
a
truly
wellmade
lager
highly
recommended
easily
masked
abv
could
pound
these
back
with
much
fun
another
great
tasting
brew
from
great

poured
a
clear
amber

an
enormous
yellow

with

toast
earthiness
buttered
biscuit
good
carbonation
and
medium
mouthfeel
d
somewhat
more
bitter
than
the

although
the
rather
muted
taste
profile
fits
the
style
not
as
clean
andor
crisp
as
i
like
my
lagers
and
a
tad
too
bitter
for
my
tastes
although
i
can
easily
see
how
this
beer
would
appeal
to
those
who
want
a
recipe
that
leans
in
favor
of
hops
without
the
tastes
being
sharp
the
tradeoff
seems
to
be
between
coldhops
and
warmmalts
update
each
bottle
increases
the
realization
that
this
is
just
about
the
best
lager
i
have
ever
had
other
than
celebrator
i
can
not
think
of
another
lager
beer
i
enjoy
more
an
amazing
beer
that
will
always
be
in
my
fridge
md
the
mouthfeel
is
a
smooth
soft
crisp
clean
finish
that
has
a
pleasant
light
to
medium
body
feel
that
gives
it
a
nice
drinkable
feel
a
six
pack
of
this
would
be
more
than
satisfying
while
watching
a
sporting
event
or
to
make
eliot
ness
proud
while
watching
a
police
related
tv
show
very
light

drinkable
you
most
certainly
could
have
a

followed
by

finished
by
some

maybe
cinnamon
at

nice

overall
this
is
a
good
session
beer
i
was
glad
to
taste
it
would
have
it
again
if
in
the
midwest
d
this
is
a
decent
brew
however
id
like
a
little
more
of
a
hop
kick
to
balance
it
out
drinkabilty
the
alcohol
is
good
the
beer
is
smooth
and
mild
i
can
see
pounding
down

no

a
fine
beer
again
from
great

maybe
at

d
the
crisp
finish
makes
this
beer
an
easy
drinker
great
example
of
the
style
great
lakes
went
right
for
authenticity
it
seems
d
well
i
love
great
lakes
and
this
beer
is
good
but
not
something
i
would
seek
out
again
much
smoother
and
better
tasting
on
tap
still
a
very
good
brew
this
is
definitely
the
best
ive
had
for
the
style
although
i
suppose
its
not
my
favorite
nonetheless
great
lakes
excels
with
beers
like
this
if
youre
looking
for
a
well
crafted
lager
or
just
a
change
of
pace
look
no
further
recommended
notes
probably
the
best
from
this
brewery
havent
had
black
out
yet
oddly
enough
this
beer
taste
very
well
in
the
bottle
as
well
comparable
to
when
poured
one
reason
why
i
miss
ohio
so
much
is
this
wonderful
brewery
please
great
lakes
distribute
to
ma
soon
drinkability
this
is
a
nice
little
beer
a
complex
beer
in
my
opinion
in
both
aroma
and
taste
it
seems
to
be
rather
sweet
so
that
may
get
to
me
after
a
while
but
i
could
set
a
few
back
with
relative
ease
i
dig
it
its
different
than
boston
lager
but
just
as
well
crafted
sure
wish
great
lakes
was
available
somewhere
in
these
parts
d
decent
this
kind
of
beer
is
not
really
my
forte
but
overall
i
was
impressed
with
this
beer
d
great
drinkability
if
youre
looking
for
malt
backbone
good
enough
hop
bitterness
to
let
you
know
its
there
but
the
malt
is
the
king
in
this
beer
drinkability
found
this
to
be
a
fantastic
beer
and
could
have
a
few
the
beer
itself
is
nice
and
full
bodied
poured
into
a
12oz
pint
glass
looks
very
clean
the
way
a
lager
should
nice
head
retention
and
lacing
down
the
side
of
the
glass
smells
of
yeast
and
malt
very
crisp
and
refreshing

also
complex

add
intrest
another
great
brew

pretty
tasty
the

on
this
though
inhibits
the
ability
to
put
more
than
one

down
on
any

occasion
atleast
for
me
an
extra
note
someone
purchased
this
for
me
and
in
the
time
that
it
took
him
to
complete
the
rest
of
his
grocery
shopping
all
of
the
great

products
sold
out

for

noble

nice

not
a
lot
of

a
bit
sticky
very
drinkable
i
thought
this
was
an
outstanding
beer
i
wish
i
could
have
this
more
often
this
is
a
super
drinkable
beer
and
another
great
offering
from
great
lakes
making
solidly
brewed
and
clean
beers
seems
to
be
there
specialty
and
i
am
excited
to
try
the
rest
of
their
portfolio
d
not
my
normal
beer
style
but
goes
down
easy
pretty
well
balanced
this
beer
is
a
very
clear
rich
copper
color
with
a
faint
head
it
presents
a
wonderful
malt
nose
toasted
malt
with
a
very
pleasant
breadcrust
scent
some
herbal
hops
are
present
in
the
aroma
but
again
the
malt
dominates
the
taste
is
slightly
sweet
and
malty
but
overall
quite
balanced
clean
crisp
malty
and
very
satisfying
balanced
and
easy
to
drink
despite
the
nose
i
can
definitely
drink
more
than
one
of
these
this
is
a
fantastic
lager
id
recommend
it
to
anyone
really
a
nice
showcase
of
crystal
malts
overall
a
great
vienna
lager
supremely
well
balanced
and
world
class
drinkablility
this
would
be
a
great
introduction
to
craft
beer
d
very
drinkable
beer
could
definitely
have
a
few
of
these
in
a
sitting
perfer
this
vienna
lager
to
sam
adams
boston
lager
in
that
style
category
summary
great
lakes
always
delivers
a
well
rounded
version
of
whatever
is
advertized
on
the
bottle
case
in
point
i
dont
have
a
lot
to
say
about
this
beer
however
i
dont
love
lagers
amber
lager
being
my
least
favorite
this
could
be
a
crowd
pleaser
for
nonhop
lovers
its
available
in
the
mixed
12
pack
and
tolerable
in
that
capacity
this
beer
is
low
in
abv
and
certainly
sessionable
while
not
my
personal
glbc
favorite
i
would
never
object
to
sharing
a
sixer
of
this
with
my
best
friend
drinkability
not
a
complex
beer
but
not
a
bad
beer
its
a
session
beer
or
a
beer
youd
have
to
complement
your
meal
this
beer
would
be
great
with
some
wings
of
all
of
the
beers
that
ive
had
from
great
lakes
this
is
my
least
favorite
but
it
is
good
for
the
style
so
i
cant
be
too
harsh
this
is
a
pretty
solid
vienna
lager
with
a
nice
amber
color
and
twofinger
head
which
left
lasting
lacing
it
smells
like
spicy
hops
and
a
bit
of
caramel
malt
and
is
very
clean
tasting
with
toasty
malt
a
bit
of
graininess
some
spicy
but
definitely
subordinate
hops
a
little
bit
of
a
bite
at
the
end
and
fine
carbonation
which
makes
it
a
good
drinker
not
incredibly
exciting
but
certainly
an
excellent
beer
this
could
be
one
of
the
beer
session
beers
ive
had
in
a
long
time
extremely
well
balanced
flavorful
and
drinkable
pours
a
deep
brown
color
with
ruby
highlights
and
a
light
brown
head
and
nice
lacing
smells
of
vanilla
roasted
barley
and
malt
tastes
like
malted
barley
roasted
barley
biscuits
and
sweetbread
mouthfeel
is
great
with
a
thick
texture
drinkability
is
high
d
okay
this
is
a
solid
amber
ale
easy
to
drink
and
a
nice
offering
from
great
lakes
cheers
pours
a
clear
amber
color
with
a
frothy
tan
head
that
retains
well
and
leaves
nice
lacing
the
aroma
has
some
hay
and
biscuit
notes
upfront
along
with
caramel
and
toffee
herbal
hops
raw
honey
and
some
alcohol
intriguing
if
not
particularly
complex
the
flavor
is
classic
vienna
lager
with
nutty
and
biscuity
malt
notes
initially
along
with
treacle
and
caramel
brown
sugar
hay
and
must
herbal
hops
and
some
alcohol
the
mouthfeel
is
medium
but
really
smooth
and
drinkability
is
good
but
limited
by
the
alcohol
presence
very
solid
lager
from
great
lakes
like
a
higher
octane
oktoberfest
pours
a
bronzebrown
with
a
medium
sized
tan
head
with
fair
retention
and
lots
of
lacing
properties
aromas
are
predominantly
toasty
with
an
interesting
nutty
element
thats
almost
as
strong
and
a
bit
of
wood
as
well
theres
a
tinge
of
alcohol
on
the
nose
as
well
but
not
enough
to
detract
from
the
main
aromas
flavors
are
remarkably
complex
with
tons
of
toast
and
pecans
up
front
followed
by
toffee
and
tea
on
the
midpalate
and
a
mostly
sweet
and
slightly
woody
finish
medium
body
is
perfectly
carbonated
a
thoroughly
delicious
beer
hands
down
the
best
of
its
style
pours
a
deep
amber
orange
clear
with
a
thin
beige
head
smell
is
a
little
hoppy
and
yeasty
and
alcoholy
first
taste
is
subdued
hops
with
a
nice
finish
of
fruitlike
fresh
bread
kind
of
a
onedimensional
hopsmalt
taste
but
good
and
very
smooth
finish
is
short
with
some
bitterness
a
solid
easily
drinkable
lager
end
beer
musings
again
not
to
harp
but
when
considered
by
style
this
has
to
be
an
a
example
in
my
book
maybe
a
very
good
rating
overall
b
but
this
definitely
trumps
sam
adams
lager
and
i
can
hardly
think
of
any
more
examples
of
vienna
lagers
that
come
close
anyone
bueller
bueller
d
great
brew
very
drinkable
nice
balance
i
would
recommend
this
to
anyone
who
thinks
lagers
are
boring
because
theres
nothing
boring
about
this
best
served
closer
to
room
temperature
due
to
the
alcohol
content
i
wouldnt
necessarily
want
to
pound
these
but
i
wouldnt
mind
either
light
bitter
finish
very
easy
drinking
and
well
crafted
nice
session
brew
d
exceptional
drinkability
great
depth
of
flavor
definitely
malt
forward
but
finishes
with
a
crisp
light
bitterness
to
balance
it
out
fantastic
beer
great
representation
of
the
style
d
good
drinkability
easy
to
drink
well
balanced
pours
a
deep
amber
like
a
dark
brandy
head
sticks
around
for
a
while
with
good
lacing
on
the
glass
the
smell
is
a
sweet
not
quite
caramelish
the
taste
is
a
little
prickly
but
mostly
sweet
with
the
consistency
being
rather
syrupy
its
alright
and
i
could
probably
drink
a
few
before
the
sweetness
overpowered
my
taste
buds
and
i
generally
like
sweet
beers
not
as
bad
as
i
thought
it
might
be
o
could
have
been
so
much
better
im
going
to
give
this
one
another
try
in
a
few
weeks
and
see
if
i
got
a
bad
batch
pretty
drinkable
and
seems
to
fit
the
style
well
not
my
favorite
from
glbc
but
certainly
a
solid
beer
worth
trying
if
you
havent
had
it
dincredible
the
type
of
beer
that
commands
you
drink
only
one
and
drink
it
slowlyappreciating
its
nuanced
flavor
d
excellent
abv
is
a
little
high
to
make
it
a
session
at
least
for
mei
like
something
in
the
45
range
for
a
session
but
the
taste
and
the
craft
make
it
very
easy
to
have
3
or
4
of
these
fantastic
work
by
great
lakes
one
of
my
favorites
drinkability
very
good
beer
but
a
little
strong
in
taste
and
abv
to
drink
more
than
1
or
2
per
sitting
d
this
beer
is
delicious
i
love
malt
but
even
if
you
are
not
a
huge
fan
i
still
think
this
beer
is
very
drinkable
has
enough
bite
for
you
hop
devils
but
enough
smooth
sweetness
for
us
malty
types
i
cant
wait
to
try
another
from
my
gl
variety
pack
the
mouth
feel
is
creamy
and
built
on
a
medium
body
d
great
drinker
much
better
than
i
ever
expected
goes
down
very
easy
requested
another
wihout
hesitation
drinkabilityi
could
drink
this
all
night
poured
into
a
pint
glass
appearance
is
darkish
orange
think
texas
longhorns
burnt
orange
only
extra
burnt
smell
is
hoppy
citrusy
floral
amazing
taste
among
the
best
ive
had
in
a
long
time
the
mouthfeel
is
amazing
just
the
right
balance
of
bitter
and
hops
and
drinkability
is
awesome
this
is
a
great
beer
regardless
of
your
preference
and
the
season
i
think
this
could
be
a
longterm
staple
of
my
collection
im
a
fan
of
this
beer
i
like
the
malthop
balance
and
the
dry
finish
makes
it
drinkable
i
havent
had
many
beers
in
this
style
but
im
impressed
the
eliot
ness
did
not
dissapoint
it
was
a
little
heartier
than
i
normally
like
but
overall
an
excellent
choice
and
i
will
definately
put
it
on
my
list
of
recurring
purchases
d
not
hard
to
drink
and
keeps
you
wanting
another
awesome
color
the
brightest
amber
ive
ever
seen
in
a
beer
good
head
minimal
lacing
decent
but
one
dimensional
aroma
just
some
stale
bread
and
an
idea
of
hops
flavor
is
a
big
improvement
sweet
and
chewy
malts
dominate
only
drawback
is
a
bit
of
an
annoying
floral
characteristic
like
a
maibock
goes
down
easy
and
would
make
a
good
session
beer
even
thought
the
abv
is
a
little
high
a
good
session
candidate
and
so
easy
and
smooth
going
down
nothing
about
this
beer
makes
it
niche
or
novelty
its
not
a
showstopper
but
its
hard
to
imagine
anyone
not
enjoying
it
pours
a
clear

an

pours
an
amber
color
with
about
12
inch
head
one
of
the
better
great
lakes
beers
having
tried
a
lot
of
them
has
a
little
bite
but
once
get
first
down
you
get
used
to
it
wont
drink
this
every
day
but
would
recommend
buying
a
six
pack
to
see
if
you
like
it
i
tried
fitzgerald
but
did
not
like
it
as
much
as
this
one
poured
from
a
brown
12
oz
bottle
has
an
amber
color
with
a
12
inch
head
smell
is
mild
some
hops
taste
is
good
malts
with
some
hops
a
tad
bitter
at
the
finish
well
balanced
feels
medium
bodied
in
the
mouth
and
has
good
drinkability
overall
this
is
a
good
quality
beer
i
would
not
mind
having
this
again
it
is
definitely
a
very
well
made
beer
and
im
looking
forward
to
having
it
again
and
trying
some
of
great
lakes
other
brews
d
despite
the
limited
smell
this
beer
is
well
balanced
and
worthy
of
a
session
d
eliot
ness
has
more
character
than
just
about
any
other
vienna
lager
i
have
tried
solid
through
and
through
i
will
be
seeking
this
one
out
again
despite
its
6
2
abv
its
very
easy
to
drink
and
one
of
these
is
not
enough
edit
i
had
to
go
back
and
review
this
again
after
drinking
it
a
second
time
and
it
was
even
better
than
before
i
really
like
this
beer
and
at
7
50
for
6
its
an
unbeatable
value
d
i
can
pretty
much
drink
this
all
day
no
issues
this
is
just
a
great
beer
by
the
way
this
stuff
is
potent
overall
the
most
unique
beer
in
this
style
thumbs
way
up
d
extremely
drinkable
this
most
recent
batch
im
having
might
be
a
little
bit
old
this
used
to
be
one
of
my
favorite
gl
beers
the
cleveland
water
permeates
all
of
the
gl
beers
and
it
is
noticeable
in
this
beer
not
necessarily
as
bad
as
youd
think
though
scary
how
drinkable
this
one
is
never
had
a
single
person
bitch
or
complain
after
handing
them
on
of
these
babies
great
stuff
to
have
on
hand
at
all
times
if
not
just
for
yourself
nice
d
would
have
another
one
in
a
heartbeat
d
this
is
my
go
to
beer
when
it
comes
to
great
lakes
it
never
gets
old
and
i
always
enjoy
it
i
am
primarily
a
dipa
drinker
but
eliot
ness
never
disappoints
d
very
drinkable
d
a
fine
beer
good
for
the
style
not
super
memorable
but
it
gets
the
job
done
d
very
drinkable
brew
medium
bodied
good
blend
of
caramel
and
malt
i
can
easily
have
more
than
one
of
these
in
an
evening
and
i
recommend
this
brew
overall
this
is
an
amazing
beer
fullflavored
and
easily
drinkable
yet
fairly
light
my
idea
of
a
good
vienna
up
to
this
point
had
been
sam
adams
or
leinies
red
compared
to
those
two
this
is
in
a
league
of
its
own
if
anyone
ever
tells
you
a
lager
is
flavorless
give
them
one
of
these
pours
a
pretty
true
copper
with
a
nice
white
head
nose
is
faint
but
has
whisps
of
dark
fruits
barley
and
very
light
hops
taste
is
all
malts
as
expected
but
is
fairly
one
note
ive
found
vienna
lagers
to
be
a
difficult
style
to
make
good
they
are
either
boring
or
a
mess
this
one
falls
more
in
the
former
d
this
is
for
sure
a
quality
brew
a
bit
on
the
chewy
side
and
not
smooth
as
others
but
the
tastes
do
rival
the
quality
shines
through
and
that
keeps
me
coming
back
go
simple
but
give
me
yum
for
an
example
of
a
truly
good
vienna
lager
id
take
a
try
at
schells
firebrick
pedestrian
at
best
i
really
thought
this
was
an
amber
ale
until
i
decided
to
write
it
up
i
even
had
one
as
little
as
two
days
ago
under
that
assumption
turns
out
its
not
hmmph
amber
lagervienna
lager
i
guess
paying
a
bit
more
attention
to
the
malt
characteristics
reveals
this
its
a
style
i
would
like
to
sample
more
widely
as
it
really
is
a
categorydefying
brew
at
least
eliot
ness
is
now
go
watch
the
untouchables
mouthfeel
is
pleasant
if
not
a
little
wan
while
my
preference
is
for
bigger
beers
this
one
is
good
as
a
session
beer
though
be
careful
at
6
2
it
will
catch
up
on
you
another
winner
from
clevelands
great
lakes
brewing
company
this
beer
pours
a
luscious
dark
amber
kind
of
like
a
maple
syrup
it
has
a
mildhoppy
but
floral
aroma
with
some
various
spices
coming
through
as
well
this
beer
has
such
a
clean
finish
on
your
palate
with
zero
bitterness
lingering
at
all
simply
unbelievable
i
definitely
get
some
residual
sweetness
coming
through
the
malts
here
very
nice
this
is
just
a
fantastic
beer
allaround
and
i
wouldnt
mind
having
this
one
everyday
with
lunch
or
dinner
perhaps
cheers
an
excellent
beer
great
lakes
beers
have
been
in
the
washington
dc
for
a
few
months
and
have
taken
the
place
by
storm
i
intend
i
hope
to
try
as
many
of
their
brews
as
possible
i
enjoyed
drinking
this
one
i
bet
that
elliott
ness
would
probably
have
throw
down
his
axe
had
it
been
available
during
prohibition
great

eliot
ness
amber
pours
a
finger
of
foam
over
a
deep
amber
brew
carbonation
is
spritzy
the
nose
clean
fruity
malt
with
a
note
of
spicy
hops
the
flavor
is
again
sweet
bready
malt
up
front
with
a
nice
subdued
herbalmeadow
kind
of
hop
off
the
back
leaving
a
lot
of
sticky
lace
behind
on
the
glass
the
brew
has
a
light
but
round
mouthfeel
dried
out
just
a
bit
by
those
spicy
hops
long
mellow
herbal
tea
aftertaste
altogether
a
really
solid
drinkable
beer
d
i
have
another
and
im
looking
forward
to
enjoying
it
i
always
think
highly
of
great
lakes
lager
output
and
this
is
an
outstanding
example
of
why
this
was
my
first
beverage
from
glbc
and
this
was
well
done
i
would
revisit
this
as
well
as
try
some
of
their
other
offerings
sweet
malt
and
light
hop
bitterness
are
also
prominent
in
the
flavor
light
bodied
decent
carbonation
and
pretty
good
drinkability
this
is
not
as
good
as
august
schell
firebrick
in
my
opinion
but
is
stilll
a
nice
beer
i
wish
this
beer
was
a
bit
sweeter
and
had
a
little
less
hop
bitterness
medium
light
body
moderately
creamy
and
pretty
easy
to
drink
moderately
high
to
high
carbonation
could
be
a
touch
lower
which
would
increase
the
drinkability
to
absurd
levels
overall
its
a
solid
beer
that
i
will
drink
more
of
since
i
bought
two
mix
twelve
packs
of
great
lakes
beers
d
good
if
you
can
get
over
the
popcorn
taste
i
dont
know
that
i
can
still
a
worth
while
beer
dtype
of
beer
you
can
drink
one
after
the
other
tasty
enough
for
craft
drinker
but
great
entry
for
macro
lover
o
from
the
look
and
smell
i
thought
it
was
going
to
be
a
real
treat
but
it
just
didnt
blow
me
away
the
malt
character
is
outstanding
but
the
dryness
of
the
finish
made
it
hard
to
get
a
full
grasp
of
the
malts
d
yes
i
have
tasted
play
doh
and
yes
this
beer
smells
and
somewhat
tastes
like
it
i
dunno
whats
going
on
here
ill
try
this
beer
another
time
to
sure
just
to
make
sure
its
not
a
fluke
but
if
this
is
what
the
beer
actually
tastes
like
i
dont
think
ill
be
having
much
of
it
pours
an
amber
tan
color
with
a
minimal
head
but
has
a
nice
fresh
beige
ring
the
smell
is
toffee
and
caramel
some
toasted
bread
and
roasty
malts
with
a
little
sweetness
as
in
fruit
or
molasses
the
taste
is
toffee
and
malt
mixed
with
some
hops
and
toast
molasses
and
honey
round
things
out
the
mouth
feel
is
medium
its
creamy
and
smooth
with
well
balanced
malts
and
some
crisp
hops
this
one
is
tasty
and
easy
to
throw
back
a
few
i
like
this
one
d
high
i
wish
i
had
access
to
this
one
a
stellar
example
of
a
craft
lager
i
much
prefer
this
to
sam
adams
boston
lager
and
thats
not
a
knock
against
sam
just
a
testament
to
the
awesomeness
of
this
beer
would
be
a
goto
if
i
had
it
around
in
my
stores
d
i
could
drink
a
few
of
these
with
some
good
food
and
company
i
would
love
to
have
this
on
tap
good
beer
and
a
good
price
over
all
pretty
good
a
very
good
beer
that
has
to
be
the
benchmark
for
the
style
nicely
balanced
this
one
will
please
most
beer
geeks
d
a
good
looking
beer
that
falls
a
little
short
decent
taste
but
a
little
on
the
sweet
side
for
my
liking
i
would
probably
stop
after
two
of
these
drinkability
this
is
a
massive
vienna
lager
almost
seems
like
a
bock
version
of
one
very
tasty
and
complex
but
not
the
easiest
drinking
vienna
out
there
d
a
great
brew
for
sure
it
is
somewhere
between
a
munich
dunkel
and
a
vienna
great
lakes
calls
it
an
amber
lager
and
that
is
what
it
should
be
listed
as
despite
this
en
is
very
well
made
being
both
refreshing
and
rich
at
the
same
time
i
highly
recommend
this
brew
to
any
beer
drinker
pours
a
dark
amber
color
with
a
large
offwhite
head
that
had
excellant
retention
before
settling
to
a
thick
cap
moderate
amount
of
spotty
lacing
is
left
on
the
glass
this
is
one
good
looking
lager
faint
hop
aroma
to
compliment
the
unbaked
bread
malt
profile
aroma
overall
is
relatively
weak
the
flavor
likewise
is
weak
even
for
the
style
slightly
sweet
malt
with
just
a
hint
of
spicy
hops
in
the
finish
finishes
clean
and
semidry
a
good
lager
body
feels
substantial
and
smooth
a
good
drinker
and
high
quality
lager
great
lakes
just
came
to
minnesota
i
started
with
the
one
i
figured
i
might
not
like
unfortunately
my
guess
was
true
this
is
a
decent
vienna
lager
it
just
focuses
on
the
tealike
hops
a
little
too
much
not
my
favorite
beer
flavor
decent
beer
just
not
for
me
excellent
drinkability
though
the
abv
apparently
is
or
is
not
above
the
cutoff
level
for
what
constitutes
a
session
beer
this
seems
like
a
perfect
session
beer
drinkable
but
a
little
pricey
drinkability
is
great
it
goes
down
easy
and
smooth
and
is
pretty
refreshing
great
choice
for
a
session
beer
and
i
plan
to
have
it
again
nice
example
of
the
style
i
do
like
sam
adams
lager
but
id
say
id
take
this
over
that
if
i
had
the
choice
d
very
refreshing
extremely
easy
to
drink
great
brew
d
pretty
easy
to
drink
but
in
general
i
dont
care
much
for
lagers
this
beer
is
ok
but
nothing
fantastic
it
beats
bmc
easily
but
i
dont
really
see
much
reason
to
seek
this
one
out
again
d
refreshing
for
a
vienna
lager
one
of
my
favorites
of
the
style
would
be
a
good
session
beer
d
this
is
a
six
pack
beer
great
for
sessions
very
crisp
and
flavorful
not
too
heavy
to
put
you
on
your
ass
pours
a
nice
clear
dark
amber
color
with
a
nice
one
finger
head
that
gives
way
to
some
lacing
the
aroma
is
of
caramel
malt
and
a
little
toastiness
the
taste
is
of
a
caramel
malt
backbone
with
some
bread
notes
present
and
a
slight
hop
bite
that
is
undistiquishable
the
mouthfeel
is
very
carbonated
overall
it
is
a
good
solid
beer
terribly
complex
but
an
easy
drink
like
i
said
a
little
more
carbonation
than
i
like
so
the
mouthfeel
is
not
perfect
even
with
the
plethora
of
bubbles
i
could
drink
a
lot
of
these
easy
very
drinkable
drinkability
the
beer
is
not
as
easy
of
a
drinker
as
i
would
expect
but
it
is
a
solid
beer
that
i
really
enjoyed
edit
did
not
fill
out
beerspy
location
i
got
it
in
isnt
listed
as
its
not
all
that
great
ledos
pizza
morgantown
wv
price
is
very
reasonable
as
well
if
you
havent
tried
the
style
and
happen
across
a
sixer
or
even
a
case
i
highly
recommend
giving
it
a
try
this
is
still
a
very
nice
brew
from
great
lakes
and
one
that
remains
consistent
on
tap
or
out
of
the
bottle
moreys
bottom
line
im
an
ipa
ale
guy
but
every
so
often
ill
try
a
new
lager
and
this
one
is
without
a
doubt
the
best
one
that
i
have
ever
had
great
lakes
dortmunder
is
the
second
i
really
enjoyed
this
beer
drinkability
another
offering
from
glbc
id
be
more
than
happy
to
drink
all
day
i
love
warm
flavors
and
i
think
this
is
a
great
spring
and
autumn
beer
as
its
a
little
heavy
but
the
abv
is
pretty
moderate
at
6
2
and
none
of
the
flavors
are
harsh
or
overwhelming
to
the
palate
cheers
to
great
lakes
f
some
bitterness
starts
to
hint
with
a
little
spicy
and
grassy
hop
presence
it
dries
quite
a
bit
but
leaves
a
strange
syrupy
sticky
sweet
caramel
flavor
more
lager
lingering
flavors
a
slight
toffee
and
roasted
flavor
lingering
too
a
strange
amber
lager
but
tasty
you
get
a
little
less

the

it

has
much
more
of

one

the
most
fullbodied
lagers
i
have
ever
had
perhaps
decoction
mashing
is
used
my
favorite
vienna
lager
when
compared
to
penn
pilsner
and
sam
adams
not
bad
especially
considering
how
old
the
bottle
is
d
not
bad
drinking
but
doesnt
stand
out
as
particularly
special
this
is
a
good
beer
it
is
definitely
one
that
you
can
sit
back
and
relax
with
pours
a
magnificent
deep
amber
ruby
red
with
a
light
beige
head
that
dissipates
pretty
quickly
this
brew
is
crystal
clear
aroma
is
dominated
by
sweet
malts
and
breadiness
theres
also
a
touch
of
hop
spice
as
well
as
a
tart
and
fruity
yeast
character
in
the
nose
taste
is
of
light
caramel

sweetness
with
a
touch
of
toastiness
finish
is
super
clean
and
noticeably
doughy
biscuity
mouthfeel
is
light
to
medium
bodied
and
a
touch
oily
viscous
zingy
carbonation
overall
a
pretty
good
brew
and
a
nice
change
of
pace
although
its
a
little
too
sweet
for
my
taste
easy
to
see
why
it
won
a
gold
medal
at
the
world
beer
championships
bbq
baked
beans
and
brats
a
natural
pairing
all
in
all
if
you
like
hops
this
is
an
interesting
brew
to
try
at
least
once
otherwise
this
is
a
brew
to
avoid
this
is
a
very
very
drinkable
brew
could
easily
drink
this
year
round
by
the

is
great

a
great
brew
hands
donw
the
best
vienna
lager
i
have
had
great
lakes
is
a
new
favorite
brewery
notes
amazing
one
of
my
favorites
i
enjoy
this
one
a
bit
more
than
their
dortmunder
gold
one
of
the
tastiest
lagers
made
reminds
me
of
an
offshoot
of
an
octoberfest
beer
flavor
profile
actually
has
a
bit
of
an
offputting
character
in
the
finish
however
this
is
relatively
complex
and
with
lots
of
layers
great
one
for
my
100th
review
easily
sessionable
and
an
easy
choice
of
caseworthiness

to
offer

a
creamcolored

is
lots
of
biscuit

toffee
caramel
biscuit
malt
and
some
fruit

slightly
sweet

carbonation
is
medium
d
over
the
top
best
vienna
lager
ive
ever
had
perfect
springtime
or
early
fall
beer
imho
and
it
went
well
with
homemade
pizza
d
this
beer
has
amazing
drinkability
i
couldnt
be
more
happy
with
this
beer
than
when
i
had
it
over
and
over
again
lower
abv
makes
it
a
craft
lovers
session
beer
i
would
recommend
this
to
a
lot
of
people
both
craft
and
bmc
drinkers
dby
far
one
of
the
best
lagers
ive
had
to
date
this
goes
down
so
easy
and
smooth
what
a
texture
and
great
flavor
grab
a
bunch
and
get
your
drink
on
pint
at
the
big
hunt
dc
in
the
midst
of
a
blizzard
dvery
much
so
d
this
is
one
of
my
favorites
in
the
great
lakes
sampler
behind
edmond
fitzgerald
of
course
d
very
enjoyable
and
easy
drinking
beer
this
was
one
of
my
gateway
beers
and
it
remains
a
favorite
standby
in
my
fridge
pretty
good
but
i
have
to
say
not
quite
as
impressive
as
i
had
imagined
did
not
live
up
to
its
mini
hype
for
me
drinkability
supremely
easy
to
drink
the
only
thing
that
hurts
this
is
that
its
6
2
abv
otherwise
i
could
easily
drink
these
all
night
i
probably
shouldnt
have
expected
a
lager
to
be
flavorful
i
like
this
and
it
pairs
well
with
many
food
items
beer
is
medium
bodied
and
smooth
no
real
aftertaste
but
there
is
a
slight
bitterness
at
the
back
of
the
mouth
good
connectivity
slight
sour
from
the
carbonation
nice
bitterness
clean
tasting
and
really
smooth
i
would
order
this
again
i
dont
if
lagers
are
supposed
to
be
this
hoppy
tasting
but
damn
do
i
like
it
poured
from
12
oz
bottle
into
pint
glass
dark
burgundy
color
taupe
1
finger
head
malt
aroma
with
lots
of
spice
light
fruity
hops
bready
malt
and
caramel
flavor
nice
balance
bewteen
the
malt
and
hops
slightly
bitter
hop
finish
moderate
carbonation
overall
a
very
blanced
very
drinkable
beer
ddamn
this
one
starts
out
subtle
but
the
more
you
drink
the
more
you
appreciate
this
brew
and
the
better
it
gets
simply
an
outstanding
example
of
the
style
so
crisp
and
flavourful
this
brew
never
gets
boring
a
masterful
beer
that
could
go
down
bottle
after
bottle
great
lakes
brewing
company
rarely
disappoints
as
this
was
a
delicious
vienna
d
a
very
tasty
and
enjoyable
lager
well
balanced
i
would
enjoy
one
of
these
any
day
but
im
not
sure
this
lives
up
to
all
the
hype
overall
a
very
drinkable
strong
lager
by
far
the
best
selection
for
the
style
i
have
ever
had
d
really
enjoyed
this
beer
sam
adams
drinkers
should
all
try
this
not
quite
as
hoppy
but
much
more
complex
d
i
could
and
will
session
this
its
very
comparable
to
boston
lager
and
probably
even
a
little
better
well
done
cheers
overall
this
is
an
excellent
lager
that
i
just
love
i
drank
up
my
keg
in
record
time
only
one
i
drank
faster
was
two
hearted
and
everyone
that
tried
it
loved
it
another
great
brew
by
great
lakes
they
got
it
going
on
i
will
no
doubt
be
drinking
another
keg
of
this
in
the
future
d
this
is
one
nice
lager
the
flavors
of
caramel
really
stand
out
and
the
addition
of
the
hops
at
the
end
are
great
the
beer
never
became
too
sweet
and
has
a
lower
abv
which
makes
this
sessionable
d
great
year
round
beer
defintely
hides
the
high
abv
this
beer
pours
nicely
from
the
bottle
leaving
a
good
head
a
good
dark
appearance
but
not
cloudy
an
amazingly
smooth
taste
that
goes
down
with
ease
it
sits
nicely
on
the
palate
being
not
to
heavy
or
light
i
truly
enjoyed
this
beer
from
the
beer
sampler
i
bought
drinkibilty
is
really
up
there
and
liked
this
one
very
much
i
like
this
beer
and
would
recommend
it
one
of
the
best
beers
ive
ever
had
a
personal
favorite
and
i
could
never
turn
this
beer
down
mouthfeel
is
medium
bodied
with
low
to
medium
carbonation
great
lakes
has
really
nailed
relatively
low
abv
beers
with
a
whole
ton
of
flavour
aroma
is
sweet
with
notes
of
caramel
and
roasted
malts
taste
follows
the
nose
with
lots
of
caramel
sweetness
with
some
roasted
malts
and
bread
notes
medium
bodied
with
nice
carbonation
very
drinkable
enjoyed
the
only
one
i
have
thoroughly
d
pretty
easy
to
drink
i
could
see
having
a
sixer
at
a
party
drinkability
very
high
excellent
beer
i
highly
suggest
having
this
at
some
point
in
your
life
or
better
yet
get
a
sixpack
a
few
friends
and
have
a
big
healthy
meal
of
roasted
pork
chops
green
beans
parsley
and
garlic
potatoes
and
an
apple
tart
or
crisp
for
dessert
great
lakes
must
have
as
many
gold
medal
winning
beers
as
they
do
employees
this
brewery
has
a
record
of
consistency
for
turningup
quality
delicious
truetostyle
beers
that
i
doubt
could
ever
be
broken
if
such
records
were
kept
the
town
of
cleveland
should
build
a
craft
brewing
hall
of
fame
and
make
these
guys
the
inaugural
inductees
d
a
tasty
lager
very
smooth
and
drinkable
great
lakes
has
yet
to
disappoint
good
drinking
vienna
very
clean
but
on
the
full
side
of
the
style
one
of
few
lagers
aside
from
doppelbocks
and
such
that
i
would
recommend
not
drinking
too
cold
and
in
fact
with
barely
a
chill
this
is
great
if
eliot
ness
the
beer
not
the
dude
is
to
be
lumped
together
in
the
same
league
with
dos
equis
or
sam
adams
boston
lager
i
feel
sorry
for
it
not
that
those
are
terrible
but
seriously
this
is
one
uncommonly
excellent
lager
thanks
to
kels
for
the
hookup
cheers
eric
this
is
a
medium
ambercaramel
color
with
light
head
pretty
light
and
fizzy
appearance
slightly
sweet
aroma
i
pick
up
some
odd
grains
like
rice
hops
are
very
prevalent
in
the
flavor
much
more
than
i
expected
from
the
smell
delicious
and
well
balanced
this
is
sweet
at
first
but
hops
bite
at
the
back
end
there
is
a
lot
of
flavor
here
but
light
bodied
with
low
alcohol
presence
and
excellent
drinkability
great
beer
drinkability
this
is
a
superb
session
beer
that
can
be
quaffed
all
night
long
absolutely
a
must
if
on
tap
drinkability
im
glad
i
bought
a
sixpack
of
this
this
is
a
beer
for
enjoying
with
a
meal
or
by
itself
at
the
end
of
the
day
and
even
going
back
for
another
later
on
its
a
solid
high
quality
beer
for
both
routine
and
special
drinking
occasions
in
my
book
i
think
id
feel
spoiled
if
i
got
to
have
this
all
the
time
and
yet
i
can
if
i
want
hard
to
knock
this
one
a
really
nice
fall
drinker
enough
heft
to
combat
the
cool
evenings
without
going
to
something
overly
heavy
like
a
ris
or
barleywine
really
tasty
mouthfeel
is
ok
but
i
couldnt
drink
more
than
2
sips
before
i
had
to
dump
it
d
at
6
2
abv
the
drinkability
is
great
not
alcoholic
tasting
at
all
very
hearty
hoppier
than
most
vienna
lagers
and
the
hop
aftertaste
slowed
down
my
consumption
very
nice
brew
by
a
very
good
brewery
looking
forward
to
trying
more
by
this
brewer
very
glad
to
have
tried
this
one
indeed
be
good
d
mildly
high
abv
makes
this
a
fun
bottle
to
session
and
the
flavors
mature
into
the
3rd
to
4th
helping
deep
amber
pour
with
2
fingers
of
slowly
receding
head
smell
is
musty
malts
mostly
which
is
mirrored
in
the
taste
almost
has
that
expiredipa
feel
with
the
mustiness
and
crayon
wax
flavors
just
not
something
i
really
can
enjoy
perhaps
if
this
was
in
the
45
abv
range
i
would
like
it
more
but
at
higher
than
6
it
just
isnt
worth
it
very
nice
for
the
style
drinkable
and
well
worth
a
try
possibly
my
favorite
out
of
the
stuff
ive
had
from
this
brewery
so
far
i
could
drink
this
beer
all
day
and
all
night
long
i
need
to
find
a
case
of
this
as
soon
as
possible
overall
this
is
a
good
solid
staple
beer
but
nothing
spectacular
this
one
would
be
one
for
a
friend
whos
a
bud
drinker
and
you
wanna
show
himher
that
theres
beers
out
there
that
arent
to
crazy
but
really
smooth
and
good
d
oh
yeah
the
mouth
feel
is
right
on
smooth
and
clean
yet
big
and
almost
creamy
very
drinkable
and
very
enjoyable
not
only
is
this
beer
spot
on
for
style
its
also
damn
good
pours
a
rosy
copper
that
is
easily
seen
through
with
a
light
layer
of
foam
on
top
aroma
is
faint
as
mentioned
on
the
label
but
not
absent
lightly
pungent
hops
and
grainy
malts
are
balanced
whereas
in
the
flavor
the
malts
step
up
to
the
hops
giving
this
beer
a
pleasant
sweetness
that
is
never
cloying
there
is
an
herbal
quality
that
reminds
me
of
iced
tea
along
with
the
earthy
hops
and
a
touch
of
fruit
finishes
bitter
well
crafted
great
lakes
is
batting
1
000
with
me
so
far
d
great
body
and
flavor
balance
d
this
is
a
style
geared
towards
drinkability
and
this
beer
has
it
the
style
calls
for
a
fairly
low
hops
presence
so
for
some
people
it
might
be
too
sweetmalty
but
thats
the
style
and
it
is
well
done
pours
a
deep
rubyamber
color
with
a
huge
bubbly
beige
that
leaves
lots
o
lace
on
the
way
down
the
glass
smell
is
a
sweet
fruity
malt
aroma
with
a
hint
of
earthy
floral
hops
taste
is
sweet
with
malts
burnt
sugar
caramel
fruity
and
bready
with
just
enough
of
a
hop
bite
about
midway
through
to
keep
the
sweetness
in
check
crisp
carbonation
medium
body
oily
almost
creamy
sensation
in
the
mouth
its
been
a
while
since
ive
had
a
great
lager
this
is
one
easy
drinking
smooth
sessionable
brew
d
goes
down
so
smooth
i
finished
before
i
finished
thinking
about
the
review
good
taste
i
could
drink
a
few
of
these
review
from
tasting
notes
dated
07
aug
2009
this
beer
poured
a
redtinged
amber
with
a
small
head
the
smell
is
candy
sweet
with
a
bit
of
burnt
sugar
the
taste
starts
off
with
a
bit
of
solid
malt
thats
cut
by
some
interesting
hop
bitterness
that
seems
to
give
way
to
even
more
malt
and
a
bit
of
nuttiness
the
mouthfeel
is
slightly
thick
with
some
moderate
carbonation
this
is
an
interesting
beer
and
an
uncommon
style
its
worth
grabbing
if
you
can
find
it
notes
one
of
my
favorite
beers
ive
had
and
especially
for
this
style
awesome
flavor
i
wish
i
could
get
this
all
the
time
i
could
easily
see
this
becoming
a
regular
in
my
fridge
if
i
could
get
it
d
its
heavy
enough
for
a
vienna
that
it
has
some
kick
but
i
could
do
a
few
of
these
pretty
easily
pours
a
dark
amber
with
reddish
tint
and
has
a
respectable
head
that
fades
quickly
i
am
unable
to
get
much
on
aroma
some
malty
sweetness
and
a
slightly
earthy
flavor
mouth
feel
is
about
medium
bodied
with
a
little
carbonation
over
the
top
of
the
tongue
very
drinkable
this
one
could
go
the
entire
night
overall
the
taste
was
not
something
i
expected
in
a
lager
although
it
was
good
just
surprising
a
little
heavier
than
most
lagers
but
it
did
have
lagers
trademark
drinkability
mouthfeel
was
tremendous
which
i
find
hard
to
say
for
most
lagers
this
one
encourages
large
mouthfills
and
goes
down
crazy
smooth
with
no
harsh
aftertaste
simply
refreshing
hoppiness
seems
a
bit
americanized
which
is
fine
impacts
the
aroma
less
than
flavor
when
it
takes
some
from
malty
juicieness
nonetheless
seems
no
freshness
issues
drinks
well
goes
well
with
my
steak
salad
with
blue
cheese
taste
very
balanced
between
the
hops
and
malts
slight
toastiness
finishes
with
a
modest
bitterness
great
example
of
the
style
notes
this
is
an
outstanding
vienna
lager
the
balance
of
sweet
toasty
and
hops
is
spot
on
well
done
great
lakes
might
be
the
best
drinking
lager
on
planet
earth
a
notch
poured
into
a
pint
glass
appears
a
copper
color
with
a
medium
size
head
aroma
of
mostly
caramel
with
some
very
light
citrus
taste
has
more
of
caramel
and
also
some
maple
syrup
very
smooth
and
creamy
to
drink
leaves
a
very
nice
sweet
aftertaste
this
is
the
best
vienna
lager
ive
had
excellent
also
a
great
session
beer
slick
and
silky
mouthfeel
really
nice
medium
bodied
with
some
hop
in
the
after
taste
goes
down
so
easy
and
with
so
much
flavor
it
could
only
be
called
a
beautiful
beer
d
move
over
sam
adams
theres
a
better
vienna
lager
in
town
very
refreshing
though
at
6
2
its
just
on
the
border
of
being
sessionable
nonetheless
its
great
to
taste
an
amber
with
some
complexity
that
still
manages
to
retain
a
high
level
of
drinkability
d
easy
drinker
nothing
too
extreme
in
any
way
good
balance
and
ample
flavor
i
received
this
beer
as
a
gift
not
really
knowing
what
it
was
and
i
was
wonderfully
shocked
this
beer
has
one
of
the
best
flavor
combinations
for
a
lager
that
ive
had
plus
the
texture
of
this
brew
is
awesome
must
find
more
asap
great
drinkability
really
nails
this
style
well
done
great
lakes
3
5
d
really
good
but
a
bit
cloying
d
smooth
tarty
and
zesty
makes
for
some
nice
flavors
and
some
nice
drinkability
this
went
down
before
i
noticed
it
was
gone
a
nice
beer
for
a
style
that
is
generally
uninteresting
o
a
good
beer
the
alcohol
starts
to
peek
out
from
behind
the
malt
flavor
in
the
middle
of
the
taste
which
is
a
little
distracting
id
have
one
or
two
but
then
i
would
have
to
move
on
to
something
else
and
there
is
plenty
to
choose
from
if
you
are
in
the
gl
brepub
the
best
vienna
lager
ive
ever
tasted
and
likely
ever
will
taste
my
goto
beer
as
it
complements
most
any
food
or
situation
the
only
thing
better
than
a
bottle
of
eliot
ness
is
eliot
ness
from
the
keg
review
soon
to
come
drinkabilty
great
beer
too
have
at
any
time
anywhere
with
anyone
just
a
high
quality
lager
drinkability
another
very
good
beer
from
great
lakes
notes
not
my
favorite
glbc
beer
but
it
was
top
3
one
finger
cream
head
on
a
deep
amber
body
head
retention
seems
weak
on
first
glance
as
it
drops
lower
and
lower
before
even
the
first
sip
sweet
nose
sour
taste
alcohol
is
noticed
right
off
almost
a
vinegar
flavor
there
tempted
to
throw
a
lime
in
great
thick
lacing
trails
the
glass
while
the
head
has
pretty
much
stuck
at
a
shallow
constant
crown
vinegar
is
telling
me
this
one
might
be
bad
im
pretty
sure
this
wasnt
what
it
was
intended
though
from
all
appearances
it
looks
fine
first
beer
of
the
day
and
the
drain
was
fed
overall
this
is
an
eminently
drinkable
and
enjoyable
beer
very
balanced
and
very
refreshing
a
bit
too
high
abvwise
to
be
a
session
beer
but
to
my
mind
a
slightly
shorter
session
of
gl
eliot
ness
would
not
be
a
bad
night
drinkability
one
of
my
favorite
session
beers
good
yearround
d
you
cant
have
just
one
this
beer
has
great
drinkability
about
it
wow
this
is
good
eliot
ness
is
plenty
likeable
great
for
washing
down
tacos
and
pizza
doesnt
entirely
stand
out
as
a
beer
to
seek
out
but
im
more
than
happy
to
keep
this
around
as
a
goto
lager
on
a
hot
summer
day
d
yeah
i
could
get
into
this
all
day
drinkability
one
of
my
favorite
beers
to
drink
when
im
back
in
western
pennsylvania
since
you
cant
get
great
lakes
in
the
south
a
bigger
bolder
beer
for
a
lager
but
one
to
sip
and
savor
and
yet
one
that
i
can
certainly
session
and
love
live
for
it
the
best
ive
had
in
this
style
and
possibly
the
best
american
lager
i
can
recall
off
the
top
of
my
head
very
good
beer
enjoy
this
one
anytime
i
very
much
enjoyed
this
beer
very
clear
coppergold
color
very
malty
caramel
smell
with
a
thin
tan
head
taste
is
slighly
metallic
but
sweet
hint
of
a
grain
aftertaste
moderate
mouthfeel
overall
one
of
my
favorite
from
great
lakes
to
have
a
sixer
of
na
zdravje
future
outlook
vienna
lagers
dont
rank
close
to
being
amongst
my
favorite
styles
but
like
all
great
lakes
beer
this
one
is
still
very
solid
probably
wont
ever
seek
this
one
out
but
ill
be
happy
to
have
it
again
if
the
appropriate
situation
arises
this
was
a
great
overall
beer
and
very
drinkable
thank
you
glb
nice
work
light
brown
in
color
fruity
character
to
the
nose
that
is
consistent
with
the
initial
attack
of
the
flavor
something
about
it
makes
me
think
raspberry
the
fruitiness
to
the
flavor
is
complemented
by
some
sour
notes
the
finish
is
a
little
bitter
or
sour
with
that
carrying
through
to
the
aftertaste
pours
out
a
deep
ambercopper
color
about
a
finger
of
creamy
white
head
decent
lacing
and
head
retention
smells
are
of
sweet
malts
a
bit
of
hops
and
spices
also
taste
is
relatively
sweet
a
bit
of
a
bite
from
the
hops
but
the
sweetness
seems
to
dominate
a
bit
of
alcohol
and
spices
finishes
off
the
flavor
mouthfeel
was
smooth
and
lightmedium
bodied
a
great
lager
definitely
drinkable
d
nice
malty
brew
that
is
easily
sessionable
and
full
of
flavor
d
one
of
the
best
lager
beers
that
i
have
every
tried
outstanding
in
almost
every
way
this
is
one
brew
that
i
wouldnt
mind
having
around
all
the
time
another
top
notch
offering
from
a
superb
brewery
well
done
great
lakes
drinkability
i
could
probably
drink
these
all
night
this
is
an
outstanding
amber
lager
tons
of
body
tons
of
flavor
not
overly
bitter
and
far
from
bland
yum
d
definitely
drinkable
a
little
heavy
for
a
lager
though
maybe
i
just
wasnt
feeling
this
one
last
night
ill
have
to
try
it
again
soon
i
really
like
drinking
these
great
lagers
it
is
a
great
change
of
pace
this
is
a
nicey
for
sure
but
doesnt
seem
to
stand
out
to
me
too
much
i
dont
know
if
this
will
become
a
fave
d
i
could
drink
this
all
day
everyday
but
either
the
brewery
would
run
out
of
beer
or
my
liver
would
give
out
either
way
things
dont
look
very
good
on
that
front
its
a
great
beer
and
very
drinkable
have
had
this
beer
in
bottles
and
on
tap
at
the
brewery
it
pours
a
reddish
amber
color
with
a
nice
white
head
it
smells
very
breadlike
and
grainy
it
taste
very
smooth
and
malty
you
can
taste
caramel
bread
hops
and
malts
it
is
extremely
well
balanced
i
can
drink
this
beer
all
day
every
day
this
is
my
favorite
great
lakes
beer
and
quite
possibly
my
favorite
all
around
beer
i
cant
say
enough
about
this
i
wish
i
could
give
this
a
perfect
5
but
i
thats
something
i
cant
see
myself
ever
giving
please
try
this
beer
if
you
havent
i
will
keep
this
in
my
fridge
until
the
day
i
die
d
the
carbonation
gets
a
little
heavy
by
the
end
of
one
bottle
which
would
limit
the
session
possibilities
and
for
me
its
just
not
a
style
that
id
keep
wanted
to
revisit
but
hey
if
you
like
vienna
lagers
this
might
be
as
good
as
it
gets
d
very
drinkable
damn
tasty
this
is
about
as
good
as
an
american
session
lager
gets
seriously
d
decent
a
good
beer
that
i
could
have
a
couple
of
i
wonder
if
it
was
better
fresher
a
fine
beer
no
doubt
about
it
overall
a
distinguished
brew
that
i
will
absolutely
drink
when
given
the
opportunity
supremely
drinkable
this
is
one
id
keep
going
back
to
clean
mouthfeel
medium
bodied
to
light
with
a
sharp
carbonation
drinkability
so
high
as
good
as
it
gets
its
good
alone
its
good
with
food
its
good
when
its
hot
outside
its
good
when
its
cold
outside
its
good
when
well
its
always
good
the
feel
is
smooth
but
with
a
gritty
rougher
texture
at
the
swallow
a
solid
amber
balanced
earthy
bitter
and
flavorful
very
nice
amber
color
a
bit
darker
than
expected
very
nice
malty
smell
not
very
complex
in
smell
but
nice
reminded
me
of
the
lazy
mag
amberjack
a
bit
very
good
flavor
with
malty
goodness
and
just
a
touch
of
hops
for
a
smooth
bittering
it
didnt
feel
overly
impressive
in
the
mouth
pretty
standard
but
the
taste
was
good
and
this
beer
was
very
nice
to
drink
i
couldve
had
a
couple
of
more
if
the
time
was
right
and
the
beer
was
available
wow
another
spectacular
brew
from
great
lakes
nothing
too
overpowering
here
nice
balanced
dark
taste
with
hints
of
caramel
and
citrus
decent
head
retention
about
two
fingers
the
smell
is
my
favorite
characteristic
of
this
beer
very
complex
and
just
plain
good
good
mouthfeel
as
well
just
a
well
rounded
beer
also
great
with
food
i
like
it
with
steak
d
hard
to
find
much
to
complain
about
here
d
very
drinkable
if
i
had
a
6pack
of
this
and
if
i
could
get
this
around
here
it
would
be
one
of
my
goto
beers
for
sure
a
very
basic
style
that
great
lakes
has
brewed
quite
well
poured
this
into
glass
and
formed
a
a
shortlived
2
finger
head
over
a
coppery
gold
body
with
lots
of
carbonation
apparent
very
nice
appearance
the
smell
is
sweet
with
caramel
and
fruit
and
a
bit
of
flowery
hops
the
taste
is
light
caramel
bread
with
a
touch
of
orchard
fruit
and
an
assertive
bitterness
from
the
hops
that
id
call
just
slightly
citrus
the
mouthfeel
is
very
nice
and
yet
not
overly
full
with
a
finish
of
light
citrus
preceded
by
a
quick
slug
of
the
sweet
malt
nicely
balanced
with
a
nod
towards
the
hops
more
than
the
malt
very
drinkable
and
this
aint
even
my
favorite
out
of
the
sampler
pack
mouthfeel
is
light
bodied
though
slightly
heavier
than
i
would
like
with
a
good
amount
of
carbonation
d
top
notch
lager
all
the
way
recommended
to
the
fans
of
the
style
for
a
must
try
md
nice
and
smooth
easy
drinking
with
nice
carbonation
and
flavor
id
definitely
recommend
this
one
overall
it
was
one
of
the
best
vienna
lagers
ive
had
wow
430
reviews
as
of
this
writing
amazing
how
many
well
known
beers
there
are
across
the
us
that
i
dont
get
up
here
in
nh
this
one
is
a
solid
ambered
color
beer
with
a
nice
white
head
bready
malts
and
good
light
piney
hops
drinks
quite
well
and
when
paired
with
a
mild
turkey
chilli
it
went
perfectly
yes
id
have
another
drinkability
is
great
this
is
a
fantastic
beer
and
very
top
notch
easy
drinkability
combined
with
great
flavor
makes
this
a
keeper
ill
be
buying
a
few
six
packs
to
store
up
and
hopefully
my
store
will
continue
to
carry
this
this
would
be
a
nice
beer
if
it
wasnt
for
the
feel
and
that
strange
chemicalplasticrubber
flavor
as
it
is
ill
still
drink
it
but
i
wont
buy
it
again
this
is
the
third
beer
ive
had
from
this
brewery
and
im
still
waiting
to
be
impressed
theyre
not
bad
but
nothing
to
rave
about
in
my
opinon
great
lakes
eliot
ness
poured
a
nice
deep
full
amber
with
a
small
tan
head
the
smell
was
of
caramel
and
citrusy
hops
taste
was
full
of
sweet
malt
and
caramel
followed
by
a
slight
hop
finish
mouthfeeel
was
nice
drinkability
was
pretty
good
almost
goes
down
to
easy
for
6
2abv
overall
this
was
a
very
nice
beer
and
spot
on
for
the
style
will
look
for
this
beer
again
this
is
a
rather
full
bodied
beer
and
really
goes
down
smoothly
this
is
definitely
a
pleasant
brew
to
drink
while
nothing
truly
stands
out
it
is
solid
in
all
categories
well
worth
a
go
drinkability
very
drinkable
the
best
lager
i
have
ever
had
that
being
said
i
would
rather
have
a
burning
river
pale
ale
at
6
1
abv
it
was
higher
that
i
expected
but
you
cannot
tell
when
drinking
it
another
great
beer
from
great
lakes
a
pretty
good
vienna
lager
from
great
lakes
not
great
but
very
easy
to
drink
and
enjoy
another
solid
offering
from
the
brewmasters
at
great
lakes
pours
a
somewhat
murky
dark
redbrown
with
a
lace
ring
down
the
glass
a
mix
of
roasted
and
sweet
malts
dominate
the
nose
mediumtofull
body
with
a
thick
syrupiness
making
up
its
texture
a
fruity
taste
along
with
sweet
malts
dominates
the
mouthfeel
for
a
balanced
beer
that
passes
sweet
and
then
has
a
minor
drying
backbite
not
a
complex
beer
but
a
very
enjoyable
one
drinkability
a
fine
vienna
lager
and
one
of
the
better
american
interpretations
ive
had
if
you
like
the
style
youll
love
this
beer
its
balanced
highly
quaffable
of
a
reasonable
alcohol
level
and
authentic
a
definite
session
brew
d
i
am
new
to
lagers
but
if
this
is
indicative
of
a
vienna
lager
im
in
i
could
session
this
in
a
heartbeat
very
nicely
done
another
cracking
great
lakes
beer
d
refreshing
lager
with
an
easydrinking
crispness
i
could
take
a
second
glass
but
would
look
for
another
beer
afterwards
d
good
beer
not
the
best
in
the
world
but
very
good
this
is
a
reliable
sixer
whenever
you
need
something
good
that
will
please
multiple
palettes
note
after
enjoying
this
beer
i
noticed
that
it
was
three
months
past
its
freshness
date
eh
it
was
still
pretty
damn
good
d
no
real
problems
here
its
held
up
well
past
its
best
by
date
no
off
flavors
malty
clean
easy
drinking
delicious
amber
ale
from
those
ohio
guys
must
be
all
them
germans
out
there
having
some
family
out
in
columbus
definitely
creates
some
anticipation
on
family
visits
to
say
the
least
a
soft
darkhoney
pour
with
unexpected
bubbly
carbonation
that
led
to
a
minimal
head
with
just
slight
lace
retention
a
sweet
hoppy
malt
with
mild
hints
of
nuts
was
apparent
both
in
the
aroma
as
well
as
in
the
tasting
a
good
decent
ale
that
could
lead
to
many
more
i
just
wish
to
get
it
on
draught
next
time
thanks
to
brian
for
sharing
this
at
the
brick
store
pub
what
a
well
crafted
very
nice
beer
pours
a
beautiful
reddish
amber
with
a
great
head
thats
offwhite
and
that
hangs
around
smells
grainy
and
even
crackery
with
a
nice
dry
malty
snap
the
taste
is
beautifully
balanced
being
both
malty
and
rich
up
front
but
dry
and
with
a
crackery
finish
great
for
the
style
rich
in
the
mouth
but
finishes
crisp
i
havent
enjoyed

of

what
a
balanced
and
tasty
brew
much
like
everything
that
comes
from
glbc
if
you
are
looking
for
a
session
beer
or
you
want
to
give
your
taste
buds
a
hop
break
look
no
further
smooth
d
this
is
one
of
my
favorites
big
tasty
malt
flavors
to
be
had
great
mouthfeel
and
all
around
a
very
strong
beer
pours
brown
in
color
with
ruby
brown
highlights
around
the
edges
nice
frothy
inch
of
head
forms
on
the
pour
smell
is
all
malt
and
some
sweetness
very
metallicoff
flavor
in
the
taste
gets
a
bit
cloying
as
well
first
beer
ive
had
from
great
lakes
that
has
been
subpar
overall
one
of
my
favorite
beers
ever
id
love
to
try
this
with
a
meal
and
see
how
well
it
complements
certain
foods
i
plan
on
keeping
this
on
stock
from
this
day
forward
bravo
great
lakes
thanks
rhinos00
for
the
opportunity
drinkability
very
nice
try
to
savor
the
well
crafted
flavor
this
beer
obviously
had
a
lot
of
attention
put
into
it
d
very
drinkable
malt
and
hops
in
good
balance
with
refreshing
carbonation
drinkability
the
cloying
flavor
is
a
bit
of
a
down
note
for
this
beer
but
overall
this
is
a
decent
amber
and
worth
a
taste
for
those
who
are
fans
of
the
style
itd
probably
pair
well
with
food
or
it
would
be
a
decent
beer
for
a
gettogether
i
really
enjoyed
this
beer
i
would
drink
often
if
it
was
avalible
in
my
area
lagers
are
usually
one
of
my
least
favorite
types
of
beer
but
great
lakes
has
two
that
i
buy
on
a
regular
basis
in
this
beer
and
their
dortmunder
gold
both
are
great
session
beers
which
i
highly
recommend
this
is
a
great
vienna
lager
another
great
beer
from
the
great
lakes
brewing
company
keep
up
the
great
work
d
easy
to
drink
and
very
refreshing
wow
what
a
colro
pallete
deep
copper
amber
to
mild
mahogany
stain
great
two
finger
head
after
the
pour
that
very
slowly
recedes
to
nothing
the
aroma
is
a
beautiful
toasted
malt
that
makes
me
think
of
toasted
biscuits
with
just
a
tocu
of
raw
honey
the
taste
has
an
aire
of
peaches
mixed
in
with
the
lovely
toasted
biscuity
malts
fruits
and
bread
in
this
viennese
take
on
lager
great
sessionbility
if
they
could
jus
lower
the
abv
a
touch
d
overall
fantastic
beer
definetly
the
best
vienna
lager
and
likely
the
best
lager
that
ive
had
period
i
actually
thought
this
was
an
amber
ale
at
first
and
i
was
even
more
impressed
when
i
found
out
what
it
was
big
thumbs
up
this
would
be
one
of
those
always
on
hand
brews
if
the
brewery
was
closer
definetly
need
more
great
lakes
md
medium
bodied
and
very
crisp
excellent
carbonation

sessionable

its
a
nice
vienna
d
very
very
high
i
could
down
these
all
day
and
night
what
can
i
say
its
pretty
damn
good
for
an
amber
lager
its
one
of
those
that
you
could
start
drinking
and
keep
drinking
all
night
alas
great
lakes
why
must
you
skip
indiana
on
your
way
to
illinois
d
all
i
can
say
is
wow
this
is
the
first
lager
i
have
been
truly
pleased
by
in
years
very
beautiful
very
flavorful
highly
recommended
notes
if
you
enjoy
ambers
or
anything
related
to
ambers
than
you
owe
it
to
yourself
to
try
this
as
with
other
great
lakes
brewing
company
beers
i
do
recommend
that
it
is
enjoyed
from
the
tap
d
very
flavorful
a
great
blend
in
an
amber
lager
this
lager
truly
deserves
the
gold

vienna
lager
i
have
tasted

can
sip
on
this
substantial
brew
all

yet
another
wonderful
beer
from
great
lakes

lager
pours
a
rich
amber
color
and
is
topped
with
a
thick
creamy
tan
head
mild
carbonation
and
minimal
lacing
this
beer
simply
looks
smooth
the
aroma
primarily
consists
of
sweet
malts
i
am
not
able
to
catch
the
faint
hop
nose
that
is
promised
on
the
bottle
the
flavor
is
outstanding
for
this
style
the
sweet
malts
are
dominant
the
hops
although
minimal
do
make
themselves
present
in
the
taste
maybe
mr
ness
just
needed
to
warm
up
a
bit
thick
creamy
mouthfeel
with
a
smooth
finish
excellent
as
lagers
go
this
one
is
phenomenal
d
im
not
a
huge
fan
of
most
lagers
but
this
was
one
that
i
didnt
want
to
put
down
it
is
very
tasty
and
easydrinking
opinion
this
is
a
pretty
good
with
no
noticeable
flaws
a
lot
like
a
sam
adams
boston
lager
being
a
hopled
amber
lager
i
think
that
the
flavor
is
more
balanced
with
this
one
this
is
a
pretty
nice
beer
and
i
think
that
i
would
drink
it
again
drinkability
high
on
the
drinkability
scale
i
picked
a
helluva
time
to
get
into
good
beers
but
to
think
ive
had
some
of
the
best
beers
in
the
world
on
an
unemployed
wage
beer
is
the
working
class
drink
but
back
to
the
point
i
now
think
that
the
10
price
tag
for
this
sixer
is
cheap
its
a
change
of
mind
state
d
the
alcohol
is
a
bit
higher
than
most
vienna
lagers
but
not
by
too
much
and
is
completely
hidden
regardless
of
abv
this
is
a
great
brew
for
any
time
of
the
year
and
probably
an
even
better
intro
beer
keep
up
the
fantastic
work
great
lakes
nice
light
orange
amber
color
off
white
head
sweet
roasty
caramel
taste
invites
you
to
keep
sipping
right
off
the
bat
very
smooth
and
drinkable
for
how
sweet
it
is
could
be
more
bitter
to
balance
the
sweetness
but
it
has
a
certain
cripsness
that
keeps
the
sweet
in
check
i
cant
always
find
this
but
usually
scarf
up
a
6pack
when
i
do
see
it
please
start
marketing
in
wi
i
would
love
to
find
this
one
on
tap
great
lakes
brewing
company
does
classicly
awesome
stuff
best
vienna
lager
that
ive
ever
had
im
usually
not
a
big
fan
of
beers
that
gear
towards
the
malty
side
but
the
balance
and
body
of
this
really
kept
the
drinkibility
good
for
me
a
very
nice
offering
form
great
lakes
d
totally
dude
eliot
ness
pours
a
clear
ruby
color
and
will
change
to
rustic
brown
when
held
up
to
the
light
a
frothy
small
tan
head
sits
upon
this
estically
pleasing
beer
upon
first
smell
i
get
tons
of
the
malt
scent
hitting
upfront
with
the
earthy
hops
coming
into
play
right
behind
it
i
normally
dont
think
of
a
beer
style
like
this
having
this
nice
of
a
nose
on
it
as
the
beer
warmed
i
got
more
scents
of
sweet
caramel
with
toasted
grains
the
flavor
profile
is
a
perfect
match
when
compared
to
the
nose
the
toasted
grain
comes
through
first
with
a
bit
of
caramel
sweetness
to
it
as
well
and
ends
with
a
slight
touch
of
hops
in
the
finish
the
mouthfeel
is
very
smooth
with
great
balance
and
the
medium
carbonation
the
drinkable
is
very
good
on
this
offering
and
i
would
like
to
replace
some
ipas
in
my
rotation
with
this
beer
glad
to
experience
this
one
again
in
full
glory
i
guess
the
recent
failed
experiences
came
from
bad
kegs
or
something
i
know
fatheads
does
a
great
job
maintaining
their
stock
but
perhaps
the
turnover
isnt
as
high
on
en
as
it
is
for
the
more
exotic
fare
anyway
these
fresh
bottles
were
quite
nice
d
i
wish
this
was
more
readily
available
around
here
this
is
a
great
beer
d
easy
to
drink
another
fine
beer
from
great
lakes
d
very
good
drinkability
flavorful
wellbalanced
refreshing
a
very
nice
vienna
lager
notes
thanks
mike
really
enjoyed
this
one
paired
with
claras
black
n
bleu
burger
which
was
fantastic
they
matched
nicely
as
the
black
n
bleu
was
cajun
seasoned
meat
d
it
would
be
easy
to
drink
if
i
liked
the
taste
i
would
normally
say
i
would
not
revisit
it
but
may
to
see
if
by
any
chance
i
had
an
off
bottle
mouthfeel
was
good
again
i
think
for
this
beer
balance
seems
to
be
the
way
to
think
this
is
a
highly
drinkable
beer
and
one
of
a
nice
field
of
offerings
from
great
lakes
i
was
honestly
supprised
by
this
one
this
is
a
great
example
of
the
style
plus
it
has
complexity
yet
it
is
very
approachable
d
really
easy
to
drink
several
in
a
sitting
ive
had
this
offering
from
great
lakes
numerous
times
and
have
just
never
gotten
around
to
reviewing
it
each
time
it
continues
to
impress
the
only
constructive
criticism
that
i
have
is
that
its
too
light
on
the
nose
other
than
that
its
a
hell
of
a
fine
beer
my
hats
off
to
great
lakes
once
again
d
one
of
favorite
great
lakes
easy
to
put
these
away
drinkability
is
good
tasty
light
crisp
balanced
a
nice
session
beer
appears
dark
amber
with
a
thin
white
head
very
smooth
lager
there
a
hint
of
vegetl
dms
in
the
aroma
with
bready
and
light
caramel
malts
the
flavor
has
a
dry
bread
crust
note
and
finishes
with
a
mixture
of
balancing
hops
and
juicy
candy
sweetness
this
is
so
nice
and
sweet
its
almost
like
a
sugar
cookie
with
a
touch
of
caramel
ive
had
this
many
times
but
never
reviewed
it
its
one
of
the
reasons
i
love
great
lakes
so
much
never
a
bad
choice
in
any
number
of
restaurants
in
oh
the
body
feels
light
but
still
has
a
lot
of
sweetness
although
does
not
have
that
unattenuated
feel
more
with
an
under
balance
of
bittering
hops
to
me
not
a
vienna
maybe
fermented
cold
but
nice
amber
dthis
beer
is
my
go
to
since
i
live
about
12
hour
from
the
great
lakes
brewery
the
beer
is
an
amazing
balance
of
flavor
feel
and
taste
and
it
can
be
had
for
sub
10
for
a
six
the
taste
is
extremely
pleasant
sweet
but
not
too
sweet
just
a
great
blend
straightforward
beer
that
delivers
great
balance
and
taste
highly
recommended
for
anyone
that
appreciates
good
beer
6

abv
so
you
can
enjoy
a
few
very
pleasant
any
day
beer
dthis
is
a
very
nice
lager
sweeter
than
sam
adams
or
brooklyn
but
well
balanced
i
would
drink
this
a
lot
if
it
was
around
more
often
thanks
to
pimpp
for
the
sample
pours
a
dark
amber
with
1
finger
head
smell
is
grains
and
malt
taste
has
a
nice
sweet
grainy
flavor
with
caramel
malt
and
finishes
smoothly
with
a
little
dose
of
hops
mouthfeel
was
smooth
and
pleasant
drinkability
is
good
with
a
6
2
abv
im
not
a
lager
guy
but
this
one
has
made
me
wonder
best
lager
ive
ever
had
cheers
d
great
i
think
i
could
drink
these
all
night
the
price
is
reasonable
but
i
think
for
the
money
trader
joes
vienna
style
lager
is
a
better
bet
i
love
this
beer
it
is
a
lager
but
rprised
it
was
a
lager
gain
sureally
reminds
me
of
a
micro
ale
a
bit
of
a
burned
carmel
te
color
is
medium
the
taste
is
burnt
carmel
but
lighter
than
say
rouge
ead
guy
ale
again
surprised
it
ws
a
lager
great
lakes
wont
stand
out
as
the
best
brewery
ever
but
you
can
trust
what
they
put
out
as
great
quality
and
true
to
style
i
could
drink
this
all
night
long
i
am
thankful
for
a
great
amber
ale
great
lakes
has
a
lot
going
on
i
need
to
visit
their
facility
dvery
easy
to
drink
not
a
favorite
of
mine
but
a
worthy
beer
that
merits
a
try
md
mouthfeel
is
moderate
with
and
creamy
the
carbonation
is
moderate
and
persistent
the
finish
has
a
bit
of
levity
to
it
that
makes
you
want
to
take
another
pull
i
think
i
could
drink
these
all
day
very
nice
d
this
is
very
drinkable
i
like
this
a
lot
it
is
a
nice
change
from
an
apa
and
would
be
a
great
session
beer
if
the
alcohol
was
a
little
lower
likely
to
be
a
great
gateway
beer
to
introduce
a
friend
to
the
wonders
of
good
beer
highly
recommended
i
love
great
lakes
have
to
say
im
surprised
at
the
scores
for
this
one
i
wasnt
impressed
at
all
pours
a
maroon
transluscent
color
with
a
medium
head
smell
is
a
bit
sour
slightly
skunky
and
metallic
tart
maltiness
not
terrible
but
not
inviting
taste
is
not
crisp
at
all
but
rather
sour
smooth
caramel
while
drinkable
i
wouldnt
recommend
it
if
this
as
as
good
as
the
style
gets
maybe
i
just
dont
like
viennas
as
much
as
i
though
i
did
looks
acsolutely
stunning
in
a
glass
its
hard
not
to
want
to
put
the
glass
on
the
windowsill
as
a
permanent
fixture
to
your
home
but
doing
so
would
be
denying
yourself
the
pleasure
of
tasting
this
brilliant
brew
the
aroma
is
intoxicating
the
perfect
blend
of
hops
and
barley
the
flavor
is
full
of
malty
goodness
goes
down
easy
a
real
pleasure
one
of
the
best
beers
out
there
makes
me
glad
to
live
in
ohio
where
these
are
readily
available
i
cant
say
enough
about
great
lakes
brewing
company
the
beers
ive
tried
have
been
outstanding
and
this
one
is
no
exception
it
poured
a
beautiful
redcaramel
color
and
the
head
stuck
around
throughout
its
entirety
its
nose
was
sweet
and
toasty
a
hint
of
coffee
i
really
liked
the
taste
very
smooth
on
the
way
down
and
just
the
right
amount
of
carbonation
full
of
malt
spice
caramel
with
a
hint
of
chocolate
this
was
a
complex
tasting
brew
but
was
refreshing
at
the
same
time
very
drinkable
notes
definitley
one
of
the
best
examples
of
a
session
brew
that
ive
ever
tried
very
balanced
and
very
delicious
theres
really
nothing
wrong
with
this
beer
at
least
nothing
wrong
enough
for
me
to
write
if
you
want
a
great
session
beer
then
you
know
what
to
try
i
looked
forward
to
having
this
one
pours
a
clear
brownishcopper
color
w
a
thin
slightly
offwhite
head
which
dissipates
quickly
leaving
moderatelittle
lacing
in
my
pint
a
mild
malty
aroma
w
lightly
toasted
caramel
notes
very
faint
dark
fruit
detected
as
well
a
rich
grainy
full
malt
flavor
a
profile
much
better
than
most
viennas
ive
had
a
bit
of
a
nutty
datelike
undertone
midway
a
med
body
but
drinks
a
bit
fuller
w
the
co2
giving
it
a
creamy
effect
this
is
an
exceptional
brew
i
regret
only
getting
6
pours
a
clear
darker
brownamber
with
a
nice
off
white
head
that
falls
and
leaves
a
lot
of
lacing
nose
is
minor
leafy
and
earthy
tones
not
much
going
on
very
minor
touch
of
caramel
and
apples
flavor
has
a
tangy
sweet
tone
to
it
adding
to
an
earthy
profile
just
a
slightly
lower
carbonation
sits
with
a
good
liquid
touch
this
is
easy
to
drink
id
be
interested
to
see
this
on
cask
d
very
nice
the
first
drink
almost
took
me
aback
but
as
i
gathered
my
taste
buds
i
was
able
to
ascertain
the
yumminess
of
this
brew
the
first
vienna
lager
ive
had
very
nice
indeed
d
this
is
another
one
that
i
have
had
available
to
me
since
i
started
craft
beer
and
didnt
try
until
now
its
wonderfulthe
perfect
balance
of
citrus
hops
and
caramel
malt
both
eliot
ness
and
dortmunder
are
excellent
lagers
from
great
lakes
ive
had
quite
a
few
of
these
before
without
much
note
however
rating
it
has
opened
my
senses
to
appreciate
it
more
for
what
it
is
its
a
solid
highquality
versatile
beer
that
could
cheerfully
be
sipped
pounded
responsibly
of
course
or
accompanied
with
most
foods
very
very
drinkable
i
could
drink
these
all
night
they
go
down
very
easy
and
arent
overpowering
by
any
means
and
a
bit
bigger
abv
than
many
overall
this
was
good
i
was
very
happy
to
see
it
on
tap
and
it
was
defintily
very
nice
going
with
dinner
i
would
not
say
this
was
excellent
however
it
was
still
a
fine
brew
non
the
less
i
would
say
it
was
a
good
call
in
a
pinch
ddefintiely
up
ther
i
could
drink
all
night
or
even
woth
the
6
2
which
really
isnt
all
that
high
pours
clear
rustic
amber
hue
with
a
one
finger
offwhite
head
that
slowly
dies
down
to
a
thin
layer
of
bubbles
stickiness
is
damn
good
flowing
lacing
all
over
the
sides
musty
caramel
malt
aroma
up
front
with
a
leather
like
smoke
scent
the
faintest
smell
of
pine
hop
in
the
nose
as
well
salty
wood
flavors
with
a
molasses
sweetness
up
front
on
the
tongue
honey
sweetness
with
a
pepper
spice
too
aftertaste
is
soft
roasted
oak
pretty
heavy
for
a
lager
but
enjoyable
smooth
carbonation
on
the
tongue
the
6
2
was
a
shock
this
is
a
damn
good
beer
another
great
beer
from
great
lakes
could
easily
drink
a
good
bit
of
these
but
the
only
downfall
would
be
that
it
is
a
little
heavy
and
that
could
get
old
after
more
than
2
yet
still
a
beer
i
would
go
back
to
drinkability
a
very
lovely
vienna
i
would
have
had
another
right
this
very
minute
if
i
had
one
chilled
and
ready
i
would
have
been
glad
to
chicago
buttery
and
smooth
texture
light
carbonation
and
very
velvety
smooth
and
decadent
finish
really
well
constructed
creamy
and
appetizing
another
awesome
selection
from
great
lakes
this
appears
to
be
a
multi
dimensional
beer
as
it
is
not
only
a
good
thirst
quencher
but
one
you
could
also
allow
to
be
consumed
at
a
slightly
warmer
temperature
to
bring
out
the
nuances
of
the
malt
well
crafted
lager
clear
dark
amber
with
a
frothy
beige
cap
with
good
retention
and
eventual
nice
lacing
roasted
barley
lightly
fruity
and
a
very
soft
floral
faint
pine
hop
character
in
the
aroma
very
balanced
flavors
of
roasted
malts
thats
semidry
and
nutty
with
a
slight
dark
chocolate
bitterness
and
matched
by
fruity
bitter
faint
peppery
hop
notes
and
a
very
slight
smoky
woodsy
flavor
at
times
nicely
consistent
from
beginning
to
end
smooth
mouthfeel
with
a
frothy
to
creamy
carbonation
d
this
is
definitely
a
drinkable
lager
that
has
a
nice
balance
of
malts
and
noble
hops
decent
solid
session
beer
with
some
nice
flavors
cant
say
that
i
am
familiar
with
vienna
lager
as
a
style
but
i
like
this
beer
it
has
a
pleasant
bready
malted
barley
aroma
balanced
by
a
subtle
european
hoppiness
it
has
a
clean
dry
taste
with
a
rich
full
mouthfeel
i
could
drink
these
one
after
another
and
in
fact
have
had
three
of
them
today
this
is
a
very
interesting
beer
good
flavors
but
slightly
different
from
most
other
beers
of
this
style
the
label
states
it
as
an
amber
but
its
actually
a
vienna
lager
over
all
good
beer
in
my
opinion
pours
a
clean
copper
color
with
an
offwhite
tan
head
aromas
of
a
dry
earthiness
and
just
a
hint
of
sweetness
in
the
taste
malty
with
a
dry
end
kind
of
stickysweet
too
a
smooth
mouthfeel
and
a
dry
maltiness
in
the
aftertaste
kind
of
oktoberfest
like
easy
to
drink
and
nice
earthy
malt
first
things
first
i
dont
drink
this
beer
nearly
enough
anymore
it
used
to
be
available
throughout
my
area
of
wv
brought
in
by
wine
and
beverage
merchants
of
weirton
sadly
someone
down
state
decided
to
turn
him
in
for
selling
beer
above
the
6
alcohol
law
that
are
fucked
laws
here
in
the
dub
vee
endorse
yes
a
beer
at
6
2
alcohol
by
volume
has
been
off
the
shelves

brewed
beer
at
its

is
butter
it
caresses
you
the
best
vienna
style
lager
ive
come
into
contact
with
thank
god
i
understand
this
style
due
to
a
single
beer
because
theres
not
many
great
representations
out
there
simple
and
pleasant
a
good
vienna
lager
perhaps
a
tad
more
hopped
than
the
average
pours
a
nice
copper
color
with
a
thin
white
head
not
much
retentionbut
good
lacing
aroma
is
of
sweet
bready
malts
medium
bodied
this
beer
has
little
carbonation
taste
is
of
sweetbreadsand
fruit
but
there
is
a
touch
of
hops
full
flavoredyet
lightand
refreshing
excellent
this
is
a
very
tasty
easy
to
drink
example
of
an
amber
lager
extremely
drinkable
i
found
some
of
this
in
ohio
and
brought
it
back
to
nc
im
already
scheming
to
find
a
reason
to
go
back
a
looks
the
type
as
a
typical
amber
lager
s
has
a
bit
of
a
subdued
smell
not
very
powerful
or
round
like
most
amber
t
just
an
average
taste
kind
of
let
down
as
all
great
lakes
beers
are
generally
superior
has
a
true
microbrew
taste
but
not
overwhelming
a
bit
acidic
lingering
aftertaste
m
solid
mouthfeel
a
nothing
remarkable
d
goes
down
nice
decent
beer
would
prefer
draft
to
bottle
on
this
one
in
particular
overall
a
really
solid
amber
lager
worth
investigating
if
you
havent
tried
it
i
give
this
beer
an
overall
score
of
4
4
out
of
5
the
beer
pours
an
amber
color
with
a
thick
frothy
offwhite
head
that
slowly
fades
to
lacing
the
aroma
is
great
it
has
a
creamy
pale
vienna
and
crystal
malt
scent
its
smooth
and
sweet
with
a
slightly
dry
lager
yeast
aroma
the
taste
is
awesome
as
far
as
lagers
go
this
is
one
of
the
best
around
its
got
excellent
malt
character
as
well
as
a
smooth
creamy
finish
it
goes
down
easy
with
a
slight
breadlike
quality
in
addition
to
a
lager
dryness
the
mouthfeel
is
good
it
is
a
mediumfull
bodied
beer
with
adequate
carbonation
this
is
a
damn
good
lager
its
full
of
malt
flavor
and
is
easy
drinkable
a
real
gem
of
a
beer
drinkability
i
like
this
beer
but
would
let
the
dortmunder
edge
it
out
overall
a
great
beer
really
great
beer
and
a
credit
to
great
lakes
into
a
pint
glass
pours
a
lovely
dark
orange
copper
tone
with
a
solid
inch
of
offwhite
head
decent
retention
down
to
a
nice
filmy
foam
in
a
few
minutes
lacing
in
falling
sheets
and
thick
webbing
the
aroma
is
kind
of
forgettable
but
lots
of
bready
caramel
malts
wafting
about
noble
spicy
hops
swirling
about
the
taste
follows
suit
with
a
more
defined
hop
spice
and
the
malts
start
off
bready
then
roll
over
caramels
quite
delicious
the
mouth
is
over
medium
somewhat
creamy
but
also
nicely
carbonated
pretty
solid
in
all
its
a
beer
thatd
make
me
a
lager
lover
and
thats
saying
a
lot
this
is
a
beer
that
i
would
recoment
to
someone
thats
trying
to
get
into
better
beers
i
could
see
myself
saying
heres
a
good
example
of
a
good
ole
american
amber
lager
drinkability
i
was
sorry
to
see
the
bottom
of
the
glass
here
another
would
be
magic
on
a
lazy
afternoon
or
evening
pours
a
nice
red
amber
color
with
a
nice
head
and
great
lacing
the
nose
is
high
on
malt
with
a
touch
of
grain
flavor
is
fairly
similar
lots
of
caramel
dried
fruit
and
a
touch
of
strawberries
in
there
too
feel
is
solid
full
bodied
and
good
on
carbonation
this
one
was
a
tasty
surprise
in
a
great
lakes
variety
pack
definitely
check
it
out
i
had
an
elliot
ness
right
after
having
a
dortmunder
gold
while
both
are
great
im
going
to
go
for
the
elliot
ness
first
when
im
at
this
bar
its
an
incredibly
flavorful
brew
with
excellent
drinkability
even
on
a
hot
ohio
summer
night
very
good
beer
by
my
standards
12
ounce
bottle
with
a
best
by
date
of
81407
the
beer
pours
an
amberred
color
with
about
an
inch
offwhite
head
head
retention
and
lacing
are
both
good
it
smells
like
toasted
malt
some
grassy
hops
and
some
caramel
the
taste
starts
off
with
malty
sweetness
and
then
has
a
good
hoppy
bitter
finish
good
full
flavor
with
this
beer
mouthfeel
is
medium
its
a
little
bit
creamy
and
slick
with
just
the
right
amount
of
carbonation
it
has
a
coating
finish
which
sticks
around
in
my
mouth
for
a
while
drinkability
is
pretty
good
it
goes
down
smooth
and
easy
great
choice
for
a
session
beer
id
recommend
it
to
anyone
to
try
drinkability
is
high
with
decent
balance
and
nothing
overpowering
drinkability
this
is
yummy
but
its
not
one
i
could
session
with
all
in
all
a
very
good
beer
but
the
overall
taste
was
a
bit
off
at
least
compared
to
the
other
ambers
ive
tried
would
pick
this
up
again
but
check
the
freshness
date
next
time
thought
id
get
around
to
reviewing
this
beer
because
i
enjoy
it
pours
a
clear
dark
rusty
color
with
a
sizable
tan
head
that
casually
fades
nose
is
malts
and
cereal
grains
with
some
hops
and
nice
deep
molasses
sweetness
like
those
candies
grandma
used
to
chew
taste
is
biscuity
sweet
malts
up
front
then
hops
and
a
honeysweet
finish
mouthfeel
is
good
and
full
very
nice
drinkability
is
quite
high
great
brew
drinkability
i
recommend
this
fine
beer
from
glbc
time
for
another
d
overall
a
good
beer
definitely
better
than
boston
lager
crisp
and
clean
tasting
with
a
good
solid
flavor
definitely
worth
the
effort
d
overall
a
nice
beer
but
i
was
disappointed
in
the
appearance
on
its
own
or
paired
with
pizza
this
is
a
real
gem
and
stands
out
for
its
style
this
is
a
very
tasty
beer
good
example
of
the
style
and
very
enjoyable
another
great
beer
from
great
lakes
altogether
a
great
brew
and
one
of
the
best
lagers
ive
ever
had
the
elliot
ness
pours
from
a
12
oz
bottle
to
a
ruby
copper
liquid
a
bubbly
head
leaves
nominal
lacing
smell
is
malt
with
a
caramel
sweetness
taste
is
a
again
the
malty
caramel
with
some
sweet
fruit
as
well
complex
just
enough
hops
to
keep
it
from
being
too
sweet
for
a
complex
lager
they
go
down
very
easy
nice
balanced
brew
this
is
just
a
solid
beer
and
i
may
have
appreciated
it
more
if
i
had
in
in
solitude
tried
it
at
the
venerable
hopleaf
between
many
other
tasty
beers
pours
a
deep
redamber
with
great
clarity
and
a
tan
offwhite
creamy
head
great
lacing
smell
is
dominated
by
the
caramelly
toffeeish
malts
and
some
vegetal
floral
european
hops
nice
malt
sweetness
at
first
in
the
mouth
somehow
balanced
by
the
underlying
supporting
hops
with
an
almost
dry
crisp
finish
medium
bodied
and
great
mouthfeel
i
could
have
had
several
of
these
but
there
were
more
beers
to
try
went
great
with
the
mussels
and
pommes
frites
this
is
a
truly
awesome
lager
ive
never
had
one
quite
like
it
i
limited
myself
to
one
last
night
but
it
left
me
wanting
more
great
lakes
makes
some
of
the
best
lagers
around
i
have
never
disliked
any
of
their
products
a
must
try
pours
a
nice
reddish
amber
color
with
a
off
white
one
finger
head
with
fair
retention
and
lacing
aroma
is
all
sweet
malts
smooth
malts
with
hints
of
sweetness
some
orange
present
very
bready
mouthfeel
is
smooth
and
refreshing
very
drinkable
great
session
choice
poured
out
a
honey
brown
color
with
a
creamy
off
white
head
medium
lacing
nose
was
a
funkadelic
with
some
green
malt
and
other
fresh
smelling
notes
the
taste
was
like
a
straight
up
lager
this
came
accross
like
mgd
to
me
mouthfeel
consisted
of
a
medium
body
and
low
carbonation
not
a
challenging
drink
but
not
an
enjoyable
one
either
translation
easy
drinking
but
who
would
want
to
mouthfeel
is
smooth
due
to
the
ample
balanced
carbonation
would
be
a
great
choice
for
a
summer
session
just
as
good
as
i
remember
great
lakes
worst
beers
are
simply
very
good
and
this
one
is
definitely
above
that
an
outstanding
beer
and
great
example
of
the
genre
this
would
pair
exceptionally
well
with
a
grilled
steak
a
marinated
beef
spicy
pork
cheddar
cheese
a
very
versatile
food
beer
highly
recommended
again
d
the
beers
malty
sweetness
fits
nicely
in
the
style
frankly
regardless
of
the
style
this
beer
is
a
good
drink
all
told
this
is
a
solid
pretty
tasty
lager
and
drinkable
as
hell
has
a
nice
lager
flavor
with
chocolate
malt
hints
of
caramel
and
very
sweet
finish
some
spice
too
i
cant
finger
very
drinkable
and
well
balanced
all
the
way
around
d
very
tasty
goes
down
very
easily
not
very
filling
good
kick
very
good
representation
of
style
this
is
a
very
good
beer
that
i
could
drink
for
a
whole
evening
yet
another
excellent
beer
from
great
lakes
drinkability
this
is
a
great
lager
anyone
who
thinks
lagers
are
boring
should
sit
down
and
have
one
of
these
sessionable
for
sure
not
surprising
to
see
its
the
highest
rated
vienna
lager
poured
into
a
pint
glass
very
nice
very
clear
reddish
brown
look
with
bit
of
head
that
goes
away
fast
leaving
very
little
lacing
no
stickiness
on
the
sides
of
the
glass
either
the
smell
is
sweet
and
toasty
honey
is
definitely
present
taste
is
very
rich
roasted
malts
honey
sweetness
and
a
nice
crisp
dry
finish
mouthfeel
is
good
some
decent
carbonation
melds
well
with
the
malty
creaminess
this
is
an
easy
drinkinggreat
tasting
beer
easily
something
you
could
sit
down
with
and
drink
a
6
pack
with
friends
would
be
a
nice
beer
to
marinade
with
id
bet
highly
recommended
this
really
is
an
exceptional
beer
so
smooth
and
perfectly
balanced
i
could
drink
it
all
night
fantastic
maybe
the
best
lager
ive
ever
had
the
pleasure
to
drink
cheers
a
solid
tasty
easy
to
drink
lager
that
you
cant
go
wrong
with
in
your
fridge
overall
a
very
good
and
drinkable
beer
very
refreshing
and
easy
to
drink
but
still
complex
and
rewarding
very
nice
session
beer
d
you
pay
for
the
lack
of
adjuncts
its
damn
good
but
when
i
get
a
24
of
the
y
for
17
in
cans
and
this
would
be
28
well
see
my
point
who
cares
this
is
excellent
if
this
was
thier
signature
beer
and
was
in
every
bar
like
dortmunder
id
be
a
happy
camper
a
somewhat
inbalanced
beer
with
a
too
strong
hop
bitterness
that
klingers
in
the
mouth
solid
beer
yum
this
is
definitely
an
easy
drinker
my
first
beer
from
great
lakes
and
if
they
are
all
as
well
done
as
this
i
look
forward
to
tasting
them
i
really
dig
this
beer
taste
very
nice
caramel
malts
with
a
nice
hop
balance
more
malty
than
hoppy
this
had
a
crisp
mouthfeel
as
well
i
love
these
beers
because
they
give
a
malt
fix
and
a
hop
fix
without
being
over
bearing
and
are
very
sessionable
a
great
beer
to
start
the
night
with
or
to
make
a
session
with
mouthfeel
was
smooth
but
there
was
some
zestiness
from
the
carbonation
nice
overall
mouthfeel
is
extremely
substantial
for
a
lager
and
feels
appropriate
i
found
this
beer
to
be
very
drinkable
pours
a
clear
dark
amber
color
nice
carbonation
small
fizzy
head
that
leaves
quickly
some
lacing
afterwards
the
nose
is
of
sweet
malts
hops
and
caramel
the
taste
follows
the
nose
sweet
and
malty
nice
touch
of
caramel
lightmedium
body
drinkable
a
nice
offering
from
great
lakes
nice
vienna
in
this
taste
of
great
lakes
day
on
the
palate
the
beer
is
creamy
and
carbonation
doesnt
get
in
the
way
but
is
high
enough
to
notice
without
focusing
on
it
definitely
better
on
tap
than
in
the
bottle
overall
a
great
brew
that
hits
the
spot
in
the
late
fall
and
srping
this
beer
poured
a
red
amber
color
no
too
dark
but
dark
enough
it
had
a
creamy
offwhite
head
had
a
storng
aroma
of
roasted
malt
and
hops
and
some
coffee
to
it
it
tasted
very
malty
and
it
finished
witha
a
very
nice
hop
induced
bitterness
that
was
refereshing
oeral
a
very
attractive
beer
that
reminded
me
a
bit
of
dead
guy
ale
and
was
equally
attractive
to
me
there
is
a
slight
astringency
that
i
am
getting
on
the
finish
that
is
keeping
the
mouthfeel
down
a
bit
still
for
the
flavor
and
the
overall
enjoyment
factor
i
still
have
to
count
this
as
extremely
drinkable
i
found
this
to
be
more
of
an
american
red
ale
than
a
vienna
lager
although
it
is
maltier
than
a
red
way
maltier
but
deeper
than
a
vienna
that
being
said
this
is
like
the
big
brother
of
an
oktoberfest
pours
a
tight
creamy
head
leaving
tons
of
lacing
down
the
glass
tasted
great
with
pork
and
sauerkraut
has
slight
burnt
chocolatey
notes
and
some
plumy
fruit
caramelly
crisp
as
well
nice
thick
body
and
pours
a
nice
red
amber
color
a
great
session
brew
and
another
top
notch
great
lakes
brew
ordered
this
ontap
at
a
small
concert
venue
quick
possibly
the
definition
of
an
easy
craft
beer
you
know
youre
getting
good
quality
beer
but
its
not
terribly
complex
and
very
simple
to
enjoy
pour
a
clear
medium
brown
small
head
on
it
with
a
bit
of
retention
in
terms
of
smell
and
taste
its
a
good
balance
of
lightly
toasted
grains
and
floral
hops
no
really
significant
flavors
stood
out
but
the
mix
of
flavors
again
made
this
an
easy
beer
to
enjoy
medium
mouthfeel
a
tad
watery
for
my
taste
very
very
drinkable
as
i
said
easy
to
enjoy
pours
copper
with
a
small
head
with
lots
of
tiny
carbonation
bubbles
the
beer
leaves
behind
a
fair
amount
of
lace
the
aroma
has
lots
of
sweet
malt
and
floral
hops
the
flavor
is
mediumheavy
hopped
and
a
good
amount
of
bitterness

is
mediumlight
a
good
beer
the
is
only
the

this

overall
a

easily

excellent

and

very

glbc
has
far
better
offerings
then
this
especially
in
the
lager
department
a
pass
in
my
book
drinkability
very
easy
drinking
d
definately
reminiscent
of
an
oktoberfest
not
bad
wellrounded
and
full
of
flavor
its
proof
that
prohibition
was
a
crime
against
nature
hats
off
to
great
lakes
d
not
the
best
tasting
beer
i
wonder
if
i
got
a
bad
batch
mouthfeel
is
clean
and
crisp
slight
increase
in
heaviness
towards
the
finish
a
bit
more
interesting
than
its
stylistic
peer
negra
modelo
but
would
be
just
at
home
paired
with
spicy
mexican
food
very
solid
4s
across
the
board
the
pour
into
my
spaten
becker
glass
raises
a
fastfalling
light
tan
head
with
large
bubbles
over
a
deep
dark
ruby
copper
body
the
lacing
is
substantial
the
nose
is
very
mild
just
hints
of
sweet
caramel
and
graininess
come
to
me
along
with
a
distinct
suphury
smell
that
adds
a
lot
perhaps
there
are
some
english
malts
in
here
the
taste
is
really
subdued
but
quite
nice
theres
a
perfect
light
balance
between
the
malty
goodness
and
bitterness
caramel
is
definitely
present
the
mouth
is
medium
with
fine
carbonation
which
ive
noticed
already
in
other
gl
beers
very
smooth
yet
still
refreshing
this
is
a
very
well
crafted
balanced
beer
that
is
a
joy
to
drink
it
would
possibly
convert
macro
drinkers
well
too
eric
d
about
as
good
as
it
gets
this
is
a
very
drinkable
very
flavorful
beer
this
one
could
easily
become
my
everyday
drinker
slainte
drinkability
is
very
good
here
i
like
this
beer
but
not
as
much
as
the
edmond
fitzgerald
beer
pours
out
a
nice
amberreddish
color
with
a
nice
two
finger
head
there
is
good
retention
and
lacing
as
well
smell
is
fairly
mild
with
some
nice
malt
carameltoffee
and
some
hoppy
aromas
taste
is
excellent
with
a
nice
sweet
body
again
dominated
by
malt
and
carameltoffee
but
balanced
with
just
enough
bitterness
very
nice
full
mouthfeel
and
goes
down
smooth
great
brew
the
eliot
ness
holds
a
special
place
in
my
heart
i
had
been
drinking
what
i
thought
was
better
beer
for
awhile
guinness
sabl
etc
but
the
first
time
we
went
to
the
store
and
picked
out
something
totally
random
we
ended
up
with
eliot
ness
dthis
is
a
nicely
balanced
easy
drinking
beer
a
great
vienna
a
favorite
lager
the
moderate
carbonation
and
mediumheavy
body
meld
nicely
to
give
this
a
crisp
creamy
mouthfeel
i
found
this
to
be
very
enjoyable
all
around
this
is
something
i
could
easily
drink
on
a
regular
basis
well
done
and
nicely
balanced
oh
yes
this
poured
a
nice
ruby
brown
color
with
a
1
inch
high
frothy
tan
head
there
was
a
low
amount
of
carbonation
the
aroma
is
really
malty
and
dark
fruitlike
there
is
a
hint
of
caramel
alcohol
the
taste
is
malty
but
also
nicely
hopped
the
caramel
is
there
too
but
overall
this
tastes
kinda
like
a
belgian
im
not
sure
why
though
this
was
slightly
warming
to
the
belly
after
the
1st
sip
the
mouth
was
dry
crisp
and
sticky
i
could
drink
quite
a
few
of
these
even
though
the
alcohol
is
detectable
there
is
loads
of
flavor
here
nicely
balanced
smooth
tasty
and
easy
to
drink
i
would
love
to
have
this
as
a
regular
in
my
refrigerator
be
very
careful
with
nessy
though
this
is
undoubtedly
the
smoothest
6
abv
on
the
planet
and
could
get
the
average
sessioner
in
quite
a
bit
of
trouble
if
heshe
loses
counttrack
of
time
moderate
mouth
with
crisp
carbonation
this
could
make
a
great
dinner
beer
solid
fours
all
around
the
mild
spiceness
and
balance
of
hops
and
malt
make
this
a
great
beer
to
go
with
just
about
any
savory
dish
one
could
imagei
enjoyed
it
with
pizza
but
looking
forward
to
new
combinations
drinkability
is
good
the
beer
is
a
little
too
complex
and
carbonated
to
serve
as
a
summertime
hot
weather
beer
though
this
is
more
of
a
go
to
the
bar
and
shoot
the
shit
type
of
beer
bright
amber
color
with
medium
tan
head
that
lingers
thru
half
glass
and
good
lacing
aroma
was
apples
and
bananas
with
a
hint
of
grapes
initial
flavor
was
the
fruits
some
hops
and
malt
at
midglass
taste
became
more
malty
and
alcohol
though
only
6
2
abv
was
more
noticeable
a
good
smooth
warming
finish
i
had
heard
there
were
freshness
and
dating
questions
with
these
great
lakes
brews
but
ive
had
no
complaints
so
far
with
this
or
dortmunder
i
had
this
on
tap
at
the
great
american
ballpark
during
a
reds
game
and
was
impressed
this
poured
a
deep
amber
with
a
medium
tan
foamy
head
that
looked
almost
perfect
the
smell
is
very
malty
with
a
sweet
carmel
aroma
to
it
the
taste
is
a
nuttychewy
malt
filled
explosion
the
malt
really
is
the
star
of
the
show
herebut
there
is
a
creamness
to
this
thats
very
good
the
mf
is
medium
with
the
flavors
balancing
very
well
this
is
an
excellant
beer
and
kudos
to
the
reds
for
having
this
on
tap
i
really
liked
everything
about
this
beer
the
color
was
a
very
nice
clear
amberreddish
with
a
bit
of
tan
colored
foam
at
the
top
the
smell
was
pleasant
and
not
overwhelming
but
gave
off
the
scent
of
hops
and
some
toasted
malts
much
like
the
taste
i
was
very
impressed
by
the
taste
and
how
smooth
this
beer
was
i
definitely
caught
a
bit
of
toffeecaramel
somewhere
in
there
which
was
a
nice
surprise
overall
drinkability
is
very
very
high
on
this
one
drinkability
good
this
is
a
very
drinkable
beer
and
is
one
i
will
definately
be
frequenting
after
this
one
who
knew
that
a
vienna
lager
could
taste
so
good
from
the
bottle
the
beer
smells
like
fruit
cake
without
all
of
the
plasticy
and
potpouri
flavors
simple
and
pure
rich
in
dark
dehydrated
fruits
of
dates
figs
nuts
sweet
fruits
are
structured
with
a
big
bready
flavor
and
aroma
full
and
round
in
the
mouth
not
too
sweet
or
heavy
finishes
very
clean
for
such
sweetness
a
little
added
alcohol
keeps
the
beer
interesting
seems
to
give
a
little
in
the
body
and
roundness
compared
to
the
tap
version
still
a
bestofstyle
contender
a
fair
offering
pours
out
to
a
reddish
amber
color
with
a
short
lived
head
of
off
white
orange
foam
and
rings
of
uniform
lace
lower
carbonation
aromas
of
roasted
rich
malts
bread
yeast
notes
some
earth
not
bad
taste
is
medium
bodied
yet
still
rather
rich
flavors
of
rich
malt
and
a
touch
of
alcohol
are
first
noted
and
then
the
beer
kind
of
goes
away
hints
of
bitter
hops
and
biscuts
are
noted
but
not
much
else
mouthfeel
is
bland
and
unexciting
drinkability
is
average
worth
trying
but
glbc
has
better
offerings
great
american
lager
one
of
my
favorites
drinkability
a
great
vienna
lager
that
goes
down
easy
and
would
match
perfectly
with
chicken
this
is
a
clean
balanced
beer
it
starts
sweet
but
bitterness
comes
in
at
the
end
dont
expect
to
be
overpowered
by
hops
though
eliot
ness
doesnt
stray
from
its
german
roots
its
an
impeccable
vienna
style
lager
it
has
ben
over
2
years
nice
i
have
had
this
got
in
in
a
trade
with
leopoldstoch
poured
a
nice
dark
amber
with
a
light
tan
head
that
left
some
lacing
aroma
brown
sugar
malts
a
little
sourness
flavor
a
nice
sweet
malt
with
a
caramel
kick
to
it
followed
by
a
touch
of
hops
just
going

with

nice
copper
color
nice
smooth

with
a

with
a
touch

good
beer
drinkability
goes
down
fairly
easy
the
diacetyl
is
the
hang
up
here
for
me
still
its
a
good
beer
in
spite
of
it
in
fact
i
really
liked
the
first
part
of
the
taste
before
the
diacetyl
finishing
part
oh
well
id
have
a
couple
of
these
in
a
session
on
occassion
pours
a
beautiful
dark
amber
with
a
medium
head
the
smell
had
a
malty
aroma
with
a
hint
of
caramel
to
it
the
taste
was
full
of
malty
body
with
a
medium
hop
bitterness
to
it
i
didnt
believe
that
the
slightly
higher
alcohol
content
had
any
adverse
effect
on
the
taste
the
mouthfeel
was
smooth
with
a
medium
carbonation
and
went
down
easilly
this
is
an
excellent
dark
lager
that
is
easy
to
drink
and
enjoy
and
is
now
one
of
my
favorites
i
would
highly
reccommend
it
eliot
ness
pours
with
a
minimal
head
atop
a
beautiful
crystal
clear
body
with
a
redtinged
amber
color
the
aroma
is
pretty
thin
with
just
a
touch
of
sweet
toffeeish
malts
present
that
trend
doesnt
hold
up
for
the
taste
though
which
is
full
and
deep
while
maintaining
a
quintessential
lager
smoothness
theres
a
sweet
tealike
character
first
off
which
morphs
into
toasted
malts
and
caramel
really
well
done
the
beer
is
smooth
throughout
and
the
carbonation
is
perfect
for
the
style
this
is
an
interesting
pleasing
beer
one
that
makes
you
want
to
drink
more
one
of
the
best
american
lagers
ive
had
d
very
drinkable
clean
finish
crisp
and
dry

just
a
tad
thin
the
6
2
make
it
a
little
tough
for
a
session
brew
but
a
good
performer
nevertheless
a
touch
of
sweetness
and
bitter
tree
bark
lingers
after
the
sip
the
aftertaste
is
quite
long
and
quite
good
however
it
keeps
this
from
being
a
session
beer
glbc
always
seems
to
make
beers
that
are
a
good
benchmark
for
whatever
style
they
are
offering
poured
a
dark
reddish
copper
very
dark
yet
very
clear
body
with
a
thick
fluffy
head
that
laced
the
entire
glass
the
nose
was
very
malty
biscuity
with
a
citrusy
piny
nose
with
the
slightest
floral
the
taste
was
sweet
maltiness
a
little
caramelly
waxy
hop
that
finished
grassy
very
good
drinking
beer
it
is
a
clean
drinker
had
this
with
an
egg
and
cheese
sandwich
on
bagel
with
spanakopia
went
very
well
very
drinkable
but
will
rereview
from
bottle
for
the
smell
of
this
beer
one
i
can
pour
overall
excellent
brew
definately
a
staple
in
my
fridge
and
one
of
the
best
brews
ive
had
in
a
while
ive
never
been
dissapointed
with
a
brew
from
great
lakes
and
this
does
nothing
to
change
my
mind
it
looks
like
great
lakes
brews
are
starting
to
monopolize
my
fridge
an
awesome
brew
from
an
awesome
brewery
a
very
easy
to
drink
beer
which
is
pretty
much
what
lagers
are
all
about
in
the
first
place
tasty
yet
easy
to
drink
this
is
a
great
choice
for
a
session
beer
d
i
havent
had
too
many
brews
in
this
style
but
i
imagine
that
it
would
hang
with
the
best
of
them
great
taste
and
mouthfeel
make
this
an
excellent
session
beer
d
i
could
probably
get
through
2
or
3
of
these
before
switching
to
something
else
the
sweetness
and
lack
of
hops
gets
to
be
a
bit
much
for
me
to
consider
this
a
session
brew
but
im
the
same
way
with
sa
boston
lager
oits
got
malt
so
youd
better
like
malts
but
have
no
fear
just
enough
hops
to
finish
well
worth
a
try
i
found
it
simply
awesome
this
is
in
regular
rotation
great
lakes
has
always
impressed
me
with
their
traditional
tastes
and
they
are
right
on
here
drinkability
is
good
but
not
great
mouthfeel
drinkability
this
is
a
medium
beer
with
a
very
nicely
creamy
texture
dam
this
beer
is
tasty
bring
me
some
more
bright
amber
with
sufficiently
frothy
offwhite
head
bit
of
hop
spice
aroma
on
an
inviting
caramel
malt
base
sweet
but
not
too
sweet
maltiness
with
just
the
right
amount
of
hop
bitterness
at
the
finish
and
a
wonderful
biscuity
aftertaste
lightmedium
body
with
a
juicy
mouthfeel
easy
to
put
several
of
these
back
solid
brew
yet
again
from
great
lakes
d
this
is
a
smooth
soft
lager
but
it
has
nice
depth
and
good
qualities
that
give
in
more
dimension
drinkability
couldnt
be
any
better
the
first
sip
reveals
an
average
body
with
rolling
fine
carbonation
the
beer
glides
across
my
palate
flavor
is
sweet
as
the
nose
advertises
with
caramel
and
toffee
again
and
a
roll
to
some
slight
roasty
graininess
the
beer
is
smooth
and
enjoyable
with
no
hint
of
alcohol
not
an
overly
robust
beer
but
tasty
nonetheless
the
taste
of
this
was
pretty
good
not
great
though
detected
some
hops
and
some
caramel
similar
to
a
sam
adams
boston
lager
but
not
as
sweet
overall
a
good
beer
though
heres
the
deal
its
a
beer
that
i
would
love
to
have
in
a
keg
at
a
party
but
i
would
never
pay
for
it
myself
again
in
a
bottle
in
a
keg
or
at
a
bar
it
beats
macro
lagers
and
some
poor
micro
brews
but
thats
it
i
love
that
it
goes
down
smooth
and
has
6
2
alcohol
but
its
not
worth
it
because
it
doesnt
taste
good
very
drinkable
no
matter
the
weather
great
with
burgers
veggie
burgers
a
very
good
drinkable
brew
overall
another
great
one
from
glbc
just
a
supremelycrafted
clean
lager
i
like
it
a
lot
this
is
an
amazing
malty
treat
very
nice
i
will
be
returning
to
get
more
of
this
brew
the
taste
was
very
sweet
with
a
hopbitterness
undertone
it
got
slightly
more
complex
as
it
warmed
but
still
was
a
little
much
on
the
sweetness
it
was
clean
and
crisp
with
little
carbonation
and
i
could
easily
see
myself
having
a
few
of
these
but
only
a
few
the
sweetness
might
get
a
bit
much
and
also
i
could
see
it
masking
a
decent
abv
however
overall
an
good
suprise
from
gl
notes
a
great
representation
of
the
style
the
taste
is
definitely
sweet
though
thankfully
not
nearly
as
much
as
the
aroma
might
expect
there
are
fruity
notes
of
raisins
and
again
a
hint
of
cherry
the
hops
have
a
nice
though
subtle
contribution
here
that
is
lightly
spicy
every
so
slightly
herbal
and
a
nice
balancing
bitterness
in
the
finish
as
the
beer
warms
up
the
sweetness
picks
up
a
bit
at
times
it
becomes
a
bit
too
much
most
of
the
time
it
is
held
in
check
by
the
hopping
levels
and
the
undercurrent
of
dry
maltiness
like
notes
of
biscuits
and
lightly
toasted
malt
this
beer
certainly
blows
most
examples
of
the
style
out
of
the
water
but
i
cant
help
but
think
that
this
would
be
that
much
better
if
it
had
not
finished
a
little
bit
drier
it
would
be
a
bit
more
in
balance
and
all
that
much
more
quaffable
another
winner
from
a
very
fine
brewery
poured
a
light
amber
colour
with
a
beige
head
that
slowly
melted
down
to
a
thin
layer
of
bubbles
only
traces
of
lacing
in
the
glass
smooth
malt
flavour
to
start
but
finishes
rather
dry
with
a
bit
of
a
spicy
bite
that
lingers
until
the
next
sip
a
very
delicious
and
drinkable
beer
cheers
drinkability
truthfully
im
not
sure
what
a
vienna
lager
is
supposed
to
taste
like
but
its
a
pretty
tasty
brew
the
sweetness
works
good
with
the
malt
flavor
not
really
a
session
beer
for
me
but
a
nice
chance
of
pace
beer
for
sure
thanks
for
the
sample
biglove
uf
ok
an
american
amber
that
is
called
a
vienna
lager
i
guess
i
dont
know
the
style
too
well
no
matter
what
style
this
is
still
pretty
good
amber
as
described
on
the
bottle
malty
smell
and
taste
slight
sourness
on
the
finish
a
fine
amber
beer
pretty
basic
but
good
another
great
one
from
glbc
deep
amber
colored
body
with
a
perfectly
proportioned
beige
head
made
this
a
very
attractive
looking
beer
the
beer
was
well
carbonated
but
not
fizzy
aromatically
clean
and
unobtrusive
the
beer
had
a
malty
floral
sweetish
smell
the
taste
was
also
pleasant
with
a
toffee
like
sweetness
spicy
hops
and
a
touch
of
mandarin
orange
sourness
there
was
not
much
hop
bitterness
but
the
well
attenuated
beer
did
not
suffer
much
because
of
it
very
clean
and
easy
drinking
beer
with
a
simple
but
flawless
construction
typical
of
classic
german
styles
pours
a
clear
bright
red
color
the
head
is
huge
creamy
and
white
with
reddish
hues
the
aroma
is
malty
and
fruity
the
taste
is
sweet
with
some
cherries
but
some
how
lacks
complexity
the
mouthfeel
is
light
bodied
and
slight
over
carbonated
overall
this
is
far
from
being
a
bad
brew
but
i
would
choose
sam
adams
boston
lager
over
this
one
any
day
this
would
be
one
hell
of
a
session
ale
if
it
didnt
pack
such
a
kick
it
still
goes
down
like
fruit
juice
though
an
excellent
full
bodied
lager
very
complex
taste
filled
with
an
almost
fruity
yet
deep
and
sophisticated
body
deep
amber
color
but
a
bit
light
on
the
head
and
the
smell
was
a
little
weak
though
it
is
tough
to
be
too
critical
on
this
point
as
it
taste
damn
good
the
mouthfeel
is
near
perfect
one
of
the
best
beers
ive
had
in
a
long
long
while
you
will
not
be
dissapointed
be
sure
to
note
my
few
objections
with
this
beer
in
the
end
dont
matter
a
bit
its
damn
near
perfect
pours
a
magnificent
shade
of
red
amber
with
a
two
fingers
of
tan
foam
crowning
over
streaming
carbonation
leaves
delicate
patchwork
of
lace
medium
bodied
and
nearly
translucent
excellent
head
retention
smells
of
sweet
toasted
malt
german
and
floral
hops
marvelous
balance
of
toasted
malt
and
noble
hop
flavor
very
smooth
with
a
sweet
but
mostly
clean
finish
if
you
are
in
the
cleveland
area
be
advised
it
is
well
worth
the
trip
to
the
brewery
for
the
freshest
beer
possible
drinkability
very
well
balanced
makes
a
fine
session
for
united
states
microbreweries
great
lakes
ranks
close
to
victory
in
quality
of
lagers
and
this
beer
alongside
their
dortmunder
are
prime
examples
i
struggle
to
find
topend
lagers
that
are
domestic
and
fresh
and
this
is
one
i
will
note
even
more
than
ales
a
lager
like
this
must
be
found
fresh
and
due
to
geography
im
blessed
to
do
so
when
i
used
to
get
great
lakes
bottles
in
philadelphia
they
were
most
often
toast
drinkability
this
beer
would
make
an
excellent
choice
for
a
session
beer
and
summer
beer
to
me
this
was
a
little
bit
better
than
their
dortmunder
this
a
beer
that
i
would
buy
again
and
easily
found
in
theses
parts
this
beer
poured
a
copperamber
color
with
a
light
tan
head
that
held
its
own
for
several
minutes
and
then
hung
around
the
rim
for
the
length
of
the
beer
the
aroma
is
of
a
watered
down
hops
and
slight
wet
paper
and
caramel
the
taste
is
of
toasted
malt
and
caramel
the
bitterness
leaves
it
it
dry
in
the
end
and
quite
bitey
its
light
bodied
which
is
good
but
really
slight
on
the
allaround
flavor
its
a
nice
summer
time
beer
a
real
creamy
feel
in
the
mouth
and
easy
to
sit
and
enjoy
a
great
brew
with
food
or
alone
a
fine
lager
to
enjoy
with
a
meal
or
anytime
taste
very
very
sweet
but
a
good
hop
bite
to
counter
theres
an
aftertaste
i
wasnt
thrilled
about
at
first
but
it
grew
on
me
one
of
my
favorite
from
great
lakes
and
quite
an
interesting
style
this
would
probably
be
the
one
i
would
order
a
second
and
study
and
enjoy
more
carefully
nice
lacing
and
head
creamy
with
caramel
and
toffee
scents
and
tastes
dances
on
the
tongue
pretty
easy
to
drink
but
not
all
evening
long
drinkability
a
very
well
executed
german
lager
style
with
excellent
taste
enjoyable
drinkability
overall
a
good
drinkable
lager
one
that
ill
certainly
come
back
to
and
could
certainly
make
a
decent
session
beer
drinkability
good
not
spectacular
overall
but
a
very
interesting
beer
nonetheless
no
problem
drinking
them
this
will
not
become
a
preference
for
me
though
pours
a
beautiful
amber
color
with
a
minimal
head
aroma
is
rich
and
carmelly
taste
is
strange
i
get
a
funky
almost
lactic
acid
taste
perhaps
its
the
hops
that
im
pick
up
but
its
odd
crisp
enough
but
not
floral
hops
its
spicy
some
toasty
notes
from
the
malt
but
this
is
a
hop
driven
brew
i
need
more
sweetness
and
malt
in
my
viennas
mouthfeel
is
adequate
crisp
and
nice
there
overall
not
an
awful
beer
but
there
are
much
better
ones
from
great
lakes
slàinte
hazy

at
the
end

fuller
then
expected
and
probably
fuller
then
most
vienna
i
tasted
before
overall
this
is
real
good
stuff
this
beer
pours
out
an
attractive
clear
amber
color
with
a
foamy
head
and
lots
of
bubbles
strong

a
little
like
hay

flavor
up

with
some
caramel
nutty
in
the
body
the
finish
comes
with
some
slightly
spicy

this
is
a
highly
quaffable
beer
and
its
no
trouble
drinking
several
another
good
beer
from
glbc
they
are
becoming
one
of
my
favorite
american
breweries
this
beer
is
certainly
due
any
and
all
glory
one
that
you
will
want
to
rerun
over
and
over
a
must
try
for
your
folder
from
that
notorious
cleveland
gang
this
is
a
hell
of
a
lager
i
think
i
just
found
a
great
summer
beer
shit
it
doesnt
even
have
to
be
summer
it
would
be
top
notch
any
time
all
said
this
is
a
nice
lager
something
that
would
make
a
good
session
drink
many
thanks
to

all
in
all
just
very
malty
and
delicious
the

this
beer
out
perfectly
the
mouthfeel
of
this
beer

i
would
have
no

putting
down
six
of

winner
from

well
this
is
a
fine
brew
that
sits
easy
with
spicy
food
and
certainly
can
be
a
session
beer
for
me
lots
of
character
in
this
brew
and
that
is
what
glb
seems
to
do
so
well
in
all
their
offerings
bravo
overall
an
excellent
brew
i
wish
i
lived
closer
to
ohio
so
i
could
enjoy
it
more
often

coming
up
as
well
slightly
sharp
up

going
into

the
hops
balance
this
well
but
do
not
overpower
it
stays
smooth
the
whole
way
through
it
finishes
dry
with
little
aftertaste
it
pours
a
gorgeous
deep
red
amber
with
a
generous
ivory
white
head
the
smell
is
a
sweet
malty
aroma
without
a
hint
of
bitterness
though
that
may
be
slightly
misleading
the
flavor
is
a
perfect
balance
of
caramel
malt
and
earthy
hops
at
35
ibu
its
certainly
not
an
aggressively
hopped
brew
the
experience
finishes
with
a
bittersweet
chocolate
espresso
aftertaste
pours
a
nice
amber
copper
color
with
a
good
two
finger
head
that
leaves
nice
lacing
on

glass
the
smell
is
good
but
very
subtle
mostly
sweet
malts
the
taste
is
absolutely
wonderful
malty
sweet
with
a
little
more
hop
flavor
than
i
was
expecting
but
it
worked
very
nicely
very
tasty
and
easy
to
drink
the
hop
bitterness
along
with
the
carbonation
makes
this
beer
feel
alive
in
the
mouth
i
really
enjoyed

and
a
hint
of
roasted

giving
way
to
some
mildly
acidic
hops
towards
the
finish
to
help
round
out
the
maltiness
a
definite
winner
this
brew
has

this
amber
lager
was
quite
sturdy
a
nice
brownish

rests
on

and
retains
itself
pretty
far
down

on
a
lager
im
impressed
smells
of
light
but
sweet
toasted
malts
and
yeast
taste
is
very
floral
and
well
balanced
with
the
malts
and
the
hops
teaming
up
to
create
a
nice
smooth
and
sweet
boquet
of
goodness
nice
and
wheaty
too
great
smooth
medium
mouthfeel
and
a
pleasure
to
drink
a
great
session
beer
in
fact

get
the
sampler
if
available
because
the
other
beers
are
pretty
awesome
too
i
was
quite
impressed
with
this
little
guy
a
nice
amber
lager
with
lots
of
character
the
beer
has
a
nice
head
that
doesnt
last
long
but
leaves
a
nice
lacing
the
smell
is
a
little
off
some
kind
of
vegetable
in
the
nose
the
taste
is
great
lots
of
biscuittype
tastes
in
the
malt
profile
hops
are
good
they
seem
to
mask
a
bit
of
a
smoky
taste
in
this
lager
moving
to
the
middle
i
can
detect
some
raisin
and
fruitcake
flavors
almost
reminiscent
of
a
barleywine
this
is
an
amazing
amber
lager
check
it

from

was

was
not
quite
there

believe
this
is
the
best
amber
lager
i
have
ever
had
crisp
medium
body
with
sharp
stickling
carbonation
a
decent
beer
and
would
be
easy
to
drink
with
any
good
reason
the
beer
finishes
with
the
light
hops
it
was
crisp
and
clear
after
a
slight
wave
of
acidity
again
like
everything
ive
tasted
from
these
guys
it
was
well
worth
a
few
and
very
well
done

i
wish
this
was
available
in
ontario
it
would
be
my
favorite
fall
quaff
another
well
crafted
brew
from
great
lakes
it
wasnt
quite
what
i
was
expecting
but
very
good
nonetheless
even
though
im
not
an
amber
lager
or
ale
type
of
guy
this
one
is
pretty
darn
good
glad
i
have
another
bottle
and
the
fact
that
its
past
due
doesnt
seem
to
have
affected
the
taste
but
maybe
the
smell
if
only
it
was
available
locally
12
oz
bottle
dated

before

pours
a
clear
reddish
amber
with
big
beige
head
husky
grain
aromas
and
a
fair
dosage
of
grassy
hops
big
vienna
malt
taste
that
is
biscuity
bold
and
aggressive
astringency
from
the
malt
complements
the
botanical
finish
of
the
hops
toasty
as
opposed
to
roasty
in
the
malt
decent
carbonation
keeps
it
burpy
and
drinkable
a
mighty
fine
lager
we
have
a
lot
of
yuengling
drinkers
here
in
western
pa
and
i
always
suggest
this
as
a
better
heartier
alternative
to
those
that
are
adventurous
enough
to
try
out
a
different
amber
lager
above
average
drinkability
another
solid
effort
from
great
lakes
drinkability
very
drinkable
beer
for
the
style
vienna
lagers
can
sometimes
get
a
bit
too
malty
or
toffee
sweet
for
me
but
the
hop
character
balances
this
nicely
and
would
have
be
coming
back
for
more
since
when
should
a
vienna
lager
reek
of
citrus
pith
and
fir
trees
its
dry
prickly
and
more
of
a
chore
to
drink
than
i
would
want
or
expect
from
a
malty
beer
perhaps
ive
been
spoiled
by
a
few
too
many
good
lagers
lately
but
i
couldnt
see
this
beer
holding
up
against
more
balanced
versions
of
related
styles
poured
into
an
imperial
pint
glass
formed
12
of
beige

over
the

brew
dense
head
shows
good
staying
power
with
heavy
foamy
lacing
aroma
is
lightly
of
sweet
malts
taste
is
chewy
for
a
lager
with
a
malty
sweetness
that
reminds
me
of
a
good
honey
pilsner
also
has
a
crisp
tart
closeout
that
leaves
me
smacking
my
lips
for
more
mouthfeel
and
drinkabilty
are
excellent
hard
to
beat
in
my
book
ng
drinkabilty
pretty
easy
to
drink
but
i
cant
seem
to
want
another
after
i
finished
one
sampled
on

at
the

a
ton
of
big
sweet
malts
overpowering
deliciously
fresh
spicy
hops
somewhat
acidic
with
a
monstrously
rich
caramel
flavor
this
brew
has
a
beautifully
creamy
active
mouthfeel
one
of
the
best
ive
had
in
the
style
which
is
not
typically
a
favorite
final
thought
glbc
has
a
great
mix
and
diverse
tasting
beer
lineup
and
this
one
never
disappoints
from
start
to
finish

having
this

am
considering
moving
to
ohio
drinkability
this
is
a
perfectly
cromulent
beer
but
i
suspect
id
grow
bored
with
it
in
short
order
its
good
but
not
interesting
slick
dinkability
and
huge
flavors
make
this
one
of
my
favorites
from
glbc
my
first
great
lakes
brew
thanks
go
out
to
both
zap
and
bighuge
for
setting
me
up
with
this
winner
a
good
looking
beer
amber
with
golden
highlights
a
nice
head
and
good
carbonation
fairly
hoppy
on
the
nose
with
a
few
other
more
earthy
scents
coming
through
as
well
nice
and
smoothly
malted
with
a
hop
tang
at
the
end
tickles
the
tongue
a
little
bit
as
you
drink
it
but
not
in
an
unpleasant
way
at
all
very
easy
to
drink
and
delicious
time
to
get
more
im
feeling
all
of
the
6
2
abv
but
its
a
smooth
comfortable
brew
if
i
had
another
id
have
another
drinkability
is
very
high
very
nice
amber
could
drink
a
lot
of
these
on
the
patio
with
a
cigar
and
an
extra
cheers
to
tavernjef
for
procuring
this
first
sample
for
me
without
a
doubt
an
amazing
beer
a
fantastic
example
of
the
style
and
an
allaround
well
made
brew
great
lakes
never
disappoints
great
lakes
eliot
ness
is
only
the
fourth
vienna
lager
that
i
have
ever
had
and
its
easily
the
best
there
will
undoubtedly
be
many
more
in
my
craft
beer
future
but
its
doubtful
if
any
of
them
will
surpass
this
one
for
acrosstheboard
quality
and
drinkability
simply
put
this
is
beautiful
beer
the
beer
after
seceding
from
the
bottle
pours
a
deep
translucent
burnished
copper
color
the
head
cyclopean
in
size
the
texture
spumescent
and
the
color
a
resplendent
light
tan
with
the
lace
a
glutinous
sheet
to
eclipse
the
glass
nose
is
a
slightly
musky
with
a
big
malt
sweet
backing
and
the
start
mildly
sweet
with
a
pleasing
malt
presence
the
top
moderate
in
its
feel
to
the
palate
finish
is
pesky
in
its
acidity
the
hops
bountiful
and
pleasing
in
their
spiciness
droughty
aftertaste
that
lingers
long
on
the
palate
a
great
beer
from
a
great
brewery
clear
copperyamber
hue
it
is
a
lovely
color
the
tan
head
reached
two
fingers
in
height
on
a
soft
pour
that
is
impressive
the
retention
of
the
foamy
mass
was
very
good
it
took
a
long
while
before
it
dissipated
to
a
cap
the
subsequent
lacing
was
organized
and
very
widespread
the
nose
has
that
typical
lager
cleanliness
to
it
no
complains
as
it
is
appropriate
for
the
style
behind
this
feature
are
notes
of
toasted
caramelgrain
and
nuts
a
faded
hint
of
hay
there
also
seems
to
be
a
kiss
of
hops
spice
the
potency
is
small
but
workable
the
aromas
are
inviting
the
first
sip
of
this
beer
sold
me
on
its
merits
the
palate
was
well
blended
with
toasty
caramel
malts
hints
of
grain
hay
and
husk
the
maltiness
is
plenty
deep
at
the
finish
is
a
good
bite
of
hops
the
hoppines
might
be
a
bit
much
for
a
vienna
maybe
still
they
work
well
in
this
offering
and
that
is
all
that
is
important
frankly
the
finish
is
clean
with
just
enough
of
a
suggestion
of
the
beer
ive
been
quaffing
the
body
is
mediumfull
and
quite
impressive
in
its
fullness
the
carbonation
is
moderately
low
as
a
whole
the
mouthfeel
is
very
pleasing
and
more
noteworthy
than
most
beers
it
is
tremendously
drinkable
eliot
ness
is
a
great
beer
sometimes
life
can
be
so
simple
now
i
will
sit
back
and
savor

this

a

it

with

i
just
love
the

afterwards
drinkability
so
far
ive
really
enjoyed
everything
from
great
lakes
brewing
and
this
is
no
exception
this
is
a
very
easy
beer
to
drink
not
too
much
going
on
to
overwhelm
my
stillintraining

sensors
but
good
enough
that
ill
be
picking
up
a
few
more
on

next

have
never

its

this
is
a

beer
goes
well
with
food
perfect
for

well
balanced
two
to
three
people
to
finish
a
sixpack
a
very
easy
drinking
brew
you
could
easily
consume

it
does
nothing
to
set

i
thought
this
was
vienna
lager
not
a
marzen
but
there
probably
isnt
really
a
difference
whatever
category
you
place
it
it
was
a
very
impressive
beer
and
worth
any
efforts
to
try
it
i
waited
a
long
time
to
try
it
and
it
exceded
my
expectations

good
balance
of

with
a
slight

to
it
smooth
and
eminently
drinkable
with
a
little
caramel
edge
to
it
at
the
back
end
id
love
to
have
a
keg
of
this
stuff
at
a
party
this
marzenstyle
lager
poured
a
nice
copper
colour
with
an
offwhite
head
the
aromas
were
of
malts
and
hops
in
a
nice
perfect
harmony
the
taste
is
malty
of
course
a
bit
fruity
fresh
floral
and
hoppy
the
mouthfeel
is
a
bit
light
on
the
tonuge
but
heavy
enough
to
slightly
coat
the
throat
on
the
way
down
the
drinkability
is
pretty
excellent
as
well
another
good
brew

the

traces
of

down

side
of
the
glass
a
nice
balance
of
noble
hop
and
caramelized
malt
give
this
beer
a
good
taste
very
drinkable
beer
considering
the
alcohol
content
did
not
even
realize
this
was
an
okto
beer
thought
it
was
more
of
a
brown
ale
but
thats
a
compliment
a
nice
creamy
head
alost
stoutlike
had
a
good
beery
smell
with
a
touch
of
fruitiness
that
led
me
to
think
this
was
an
ale
a
complex
hop
taste
that
i
thought
had
more
american
hops
that
the
normal
german
ones
a
delightful
brew
that
stands
out
at
any
autumn
party
what
a
great
session
beer
for
the
chilly
fall
months
nicely
warming
and
comforting
i
will

perhaps
a
bit
more
the

side
but
still
very
nice
the
hoppiness
has
a
nice
finish
that
is
to
say
it
doesnt
hang
around
long
which
is
what
i
like
mouthfeel
is
better
than
average
the
malt
and
hop
flavors
are
very
distinctive
and
seperate
it
would
be
nicer
if
they
were
mixed
together
a
bit
more
so
that
they
compliment
and
help
balance
each
other
better
this
is
a
very
drinkable
brew
not
one
to
get
drunk
on
but
one
to
kick
back
and
enjoy
several
of
the
flavor

pronounced
graininess

an
odd
note
is
that
this
was
given
to
me
by
a
canadian
innkeeper
who
has
guests
bring
this
up
from
cleveland
just
one
of
the
fantastic
beers
out
of
great
lakes
as
much
as
it
pains
me
to
say
it
coming
from
the
pittsburgh
area
something
from
cleveland
isnt
really
all
that
bad
at
all
wow
what
a
gem
if
youre
a
marzen
oktoberfest
fan
pours
a
clear
deep
reddish
amber
with
a
thick
luscious
creamy
light
tan
head
sweet
malt
aroma
seems
almost
bocklike
but
consists
of
caramel
and
raisin
the
mouthfeel
is
smooth
and
creamy
with
just
a
touch
of
carbonation
taste
has
a
real
nice
sweet
rich
chewy
malt
flavor
that
also
consists
of
dark
fruit
raisins
and
caramel
this
seemed
evident
from
the
nose
hallertau
hops
provide
a
mildly
dry
bitter
middle
they
provide
a
good
balance
to
the
sweet
malt
finish
being
a
big
fan
of
oktoberfest
beers
this
was
a
real
treat
a
thank
you
goes
out
to
realale
for
the
bottle
this
was
some
amazing
stuff
never
before
had
i
had
a
vienna
like
this
and
id
be
hardpressed
to
find
another
vienna
that
was
this
high
quality
it
definitely
had
a
sweet
caramel
malt
that
dominated
the
flavor
but
was
not
overbearing
soothing
tealike
hops
came
in
to
balance
and
add
to
complexity
more
flavors
ensued
but
i
could
not
pick
up
on
what
exactly
they
were
they
were
good
though
the
beers
finish
tasted
exactly
like
the
bread
i
buy
from
my
local
bakery
light
honey
nut
wheat
bread
that
is
superb
this
ones
a
classic
pours
a
beautiful
tawny
color
and
sports
a
creamy
light
golden
headi
bet
this
would
make
a
great
color
for
a
lense
on
a
pair
of
sunglasses
take
a
look
through
the
glass
towards
your
favorite
light
source
the
nose
is
almost
that
of
something
sweet
baking
away
in
the
oven
loads
of
baking
spice
here
as
well
as
some
caramelized
vanilla
sugar
in
the
background
now
that
ive
been
smelling
this
beer
sipping
and
enjoying
its
color
there
does
not
appear
to
be
enough
to
give
a
proper
flavor
analysis
ill
open
another
ahhhh
there
you
go
rich
and
malty
bordering
on
syrupy
until
a
spattering
of
hops
clean
things
up
alternate
malt
hop
vanilla
sugar
spice
gulprepeat
as
desired
tastet
stuff
very
wellbalanced
in
the
mouth
with
the
malt
hop
and
carbonation
all
forming
a
lovely
coherent
whole
touch
too
much
caramel
flavor
in
this
one
but
the
sweetness
of
the
malt
is
wellbalanced
great
bottleconditioned
mouthfeel
and
medium
weight
finishes
with
a
hint
of
calciumsulphur
a
nice
red
copper
brew
sits
in
my
glass
with
a
slightly
yellowish
head
that
is
thick
initially
but
quickly
dies
down
to
about
14
sweet
malts
come
to
the
nose
with
the
hops
spices
and
hints
of
fruitiness
coming
through
tastes
kinda
like
a
sourish
sweet
malt
flavor
with
an
apple
like
fruit
presence
this
beer
has
an
odd
complexity
that
i
cant
quite
put
my
finger
on
seems
to
be
more
like
an
amber
ale
at
first
but
then
finishes
with
the
lager
a
different
brew
this
brew
pours
a
glowing
amber
color
with
a
creamy
offwhite
head
nose
is
mostly
sweet
and
fruity
although
some
earthyspicy
hops
peek
their
collective
heads
out
to
let
you
know
theyre
present
too
caramel
malt
is
the
featured
flavor
here
although
some
red
apple
fruitiness
and
spicy
hops
linger
behind
mouthfeel
is
somewhat
carbonated
but
quite
smooth
overall
this
is
a
very
drinkable
beer
and
one
that
i
find
pairs
particularly
well
with
mexican
cuisine
if
youre
a
fan
of
viennastyle
lagers
this
one
is
about
as
good
an
american
sample
as
ive
come
across
this
is
very
similar
to
bells
amber
ale
with
more
earth
plus
a
more
intense
hop
finish
one
of
the
best
amber
lagers
out
there
viennastyle
or
not
another
excellent
brew
from
great
lakes
they
can
do
no
wrong
as
i
have
tried
all
of
glbcs
brews
to
date
i
must
say
this
is
my
least
favorite
having
said
that
it
is
still
a
great
beer
its
just
a
little
different
that
what
i
really
like
however
if
you
like
a
malty
semisweet
finishing
brew
that
is
slightly
heavier
than
a
typical
lager
and
has
alot
more
taste
this
one
should
appeal
to
you
personally
i
feel
it
has
a
lot
of
carbonation
and
it
kind
of
takes
away
from
the
overall
impression
not
my
style
but
i
can
appreciate
it
for
what
it
is
the
eliot
ness
pours
a
clear
red
amber
color
with
a
very
thick
fluffy
offwhite
head
the
smell
is
fairly
mild
some
malt
is
present
as
is
an
almost
bourbon
or
whiskey
type
aroma
the
taste
is
somewhat
spicy
the
primary
flavors
seem
to
be
those
of
malt
with
a
bit
of
hops
the
finish
leaves
an
oaky
taste
and
a
hint
of
the
bourbon
that
came
through
in
the
smell
a
relatively
smooth
medium
bodied
beer
the
drinkability
has
improved
since
the
first
time
i
had
it
although
it
noticeably
drops
as
the
beer
warms
up
ive
given
this
beer
several
tries
at
different
times
thinking
that
i
should
like
it
more
but
never
seem
to
this
beer
pours
an
amber
color
with
tons
of
carbonation
on
the
sides
of
the
glass
and
a
small
head
that
oddly
centers
itself
in
the
center
the
aroma
is
not
very
strong
but
i
can
sense
home
hints
of
fruit
and
light
malts
the
taste
is
amazingly
smooth
and
enjoyable
its
a
little
sweet
and
the
carbonation
makes
it
more
interesting
the
aftertaste
is
sweet
but
reminescent
of
something
earthy
cant
pinpoint
it
very
good
beer
i
could
drink
this
one
all
night
long
originally
sampled
on
10
november
2002
this
pours
a
beautiful
amber
color
w
a
2
5cm
head
crystal
clear
w
a
big
malt
nose
well
balanced
flavors
in
my
humble
opinion
this
is
a
very
good
example
of
what
an
oktoberfest
beer
should
taste
like
this
beer
poured
out
a
clear
and
deep
coppericed
tea
color
and
had
a
foamy
off
white
and
creamy
head
this
one
is
deliciously
bitter
and
malty
at
the
same
time
nice
pairing
of
the
malts
and
hops
the
alcohol
is
well
hidden
here
theres
some
caramel
sweetness
to
it
also
an
excellent
amber
lager
with
a
weighty
body
to
it
highly
drinkable
and
very
enjoyable
this
is
just
about
my
favorite
beer
definately
my
favorite
lager
it
was
a
very
deep
red
color
and
had
a
warm
roasted
smell
tastes
very
smooth
warms
the
mouth
with
a
slightly
nutty
taste
would
never
guess
the
alcohol
content
from
the
taste
it
is
definately
hidden
well
it
was
just
so
good
i
think
im
gonna
have
to
have
another
clear
deep
red
amber
color
with
a
thin
head
and
minimal
lace
aroma
was
sweet
and
smelled
somewhat
of
bready
yeast
the
taste
started
out
with
a
sweet
well
pronounced
carmel
flavor
and
some
bread
flavors
coming
out
as
well
mildly
hoppy
with
floral
hops
but
not
enough
bitterness
to
balance
out
the
malt
sweetness
overall
a
tasty
beer
but
a
little
off
balance
i
had
this
brew
in
a
12oz
bottle
poured
into
a
spaten
oktoberfest
glass
the
color
is
a
deep
red
with
a
large
offwhite
head
which
really
sticks
around
leaving
good
lacing
the
smell
is
almost
a
sweet
caramel
aroma
the
taste
is
a
bit
sweet
and
malty
could
use
a
little
bit
more
hops
the
mouthfeel
is
a
little
oily
this
is
a
very
drinkable
lager
that
is
very
refreshing
im
glad
i
decided
to
grab
a
sixxer
of
this
instead
of
a
single
this
fine
beer
pours
a
deep
copper
red
with
a
thick
tan
head
that
quickly
recedes
to
a
thin
film
the
aroma
is
sweet
and
malty
just
like
the
taste
begins
efore
the
sweetness
gets
a
hold
the
hops
kick
in
just
a
touch
too
much
for
me
and
balance
it
out
very
well
pours
a
clear
amber
with
a
fairly
persistent
cream
colored
head
does
manage
to
leave
behind
some
lace
and
a
thin
layer
of
foam
sits
atop
the
beer
aroma
is
malty
with
caramel
toasted
malt
and
a
touch
of
herbal
hops
flavor
is
sweet
and
fruity
some
hints
of
bread
mixed
in
with
caramel
mouthfeel
is
smooth
and
creamy
with
moderate
carbonation
and
it
has
a
medium
body
i
would
personally
like
a
touch
more
bitterness
in
the
finish
but
this
is
a
very
solid
marzen
style
beer
a
very
complex
brew
but
another
good
one
from
glbc
it
pours
a
very
nice
cranberry
like
amber
with
an
off
white
head
just
under
an
inch
lace
is
good
and
plenty
throughout
the
drink
the
aroma
is
floral
and
of
toasted
grain
taste
is
smooth
but
with
a
bite
a
malty
caramal
with
a
spicy
hop
flavor
the
mouth
is
left
with
a
hop
aftertaste
like
i
said
its
complex
alot
going
on
with
thisone
but
in
good
gl
quality
manor
i
only
had
one
sitting
with
this
id
like
to
try
it
again
now
that
i
know
what
to
expect
yet
another
superb
offering
from
glbc
rich
reddish

is
a

but
rich

mellow
in

i
detect
a
touch
a
light
nut
taste
as
well
the
body
sits
heavy
on
the
tongue
and
carbonation
is
nearly
nonexistent
it
finishes
with
a
silky
feeling
down
the
throat
and
a
dry
feeling
in
the
mouth
extremely
drinkable
and
the
best
vienna
i
have
yet
had
this
beer
pours
a
slightly
hazy
medium
dark
golden
red
with
a
large
dark
tan
head
the
mouthfeel
is
very
firm
the
smell
is
cookielike
and
very
slightly
herbal
the
taste
is
roasted
malt
with
a
very
soft
pleasing
hoppy
finish
this
is
a
very
smooth
drinkable
vienna
style
lager
i
tried
this
recently
on
tap
and
it
seemed
consistent
with
the
bottled
version
although
the
head
lingered
longer
combined
with
a
roast
beef
on

combo

leans
more
toward
a

in

rather
than
the
toasty
characters
of

vienna
lagers
so
i
thinks
its
a
little
off
the
typical
aspects
of
style
still
another
nice
one
from
a
standout
brewery
pours
a
nice
light
brown
reddish
hue
with
a
off
white
head
nice
malty
aroma
tastes
great
the
first
vienna
style
lager
i
have
ever
tried
smooth
maltiness
with
a
little
bit
of
hops
thrown
in
to
balance
things
out
great
lakes
simply
makes
great
beers
i
cant
say
i
have
ever
tried
one
i
didnt
like
pours
deep
red
with
a
real
beefy
head
nice
blend
of
hops
and
malt
providing
both
an
enjoyable
smell
and
even
better
taste
enjoyable
all
the
way
round
nothing
wrong
with
this
one
highly
recommended
for
this
style
this
is
my
first
sample
of
any
great
lakes
brew
and
i
must
say
im
quite
impressed
it
pours
a
deep
reddish
brown
in
the
glass
with
a
tan
head
that
maintains
a
slight
cap
the
smell
is
mostly
the
signature
lightmedium
toasted
malt
so
evident
in
any
good
vienna
lager
with
some
grain
lingering
in
the
background
the
taste
is
malt
dominated
with
a
pralinelike
sweetness
but
theres
ample
hops
to
provide
a
crisp
slightly
herbal
bitter
finish
personally
im
partial
to
hoppy
brews
but
i
know
quality
when
i
taste
it
thank
you
great
lakes
for
an
outstanding
brew
i
look
forward
to
rest
of
my
gl
sampler
pack
rereview
with
side
by
side
comparison
with
sam
adams
vienna
style
more
red
in
appearance
than
sam
adams
the
most
noticeable
difference
from
the
sam
adams
is
the
extra
spicy
hops
kick
in
the
eliot
ness
sam
adams
seems
a
little
flat
in
comparison
this
is
a
good
beer
for
those
who
like
a
lot
of
malt
flavor
as
i
believe
to
be
true
with
viennastyle
lagers
this
beer
is
predominantly
malt
aroma
and
flavor
with
enough
hops
to
clean
up
the
finish
at
warmer
temperatures
this
beer
exhibits
a
wonderful
sweetness
but
its
difficult
to
let
it
sit
long
enough
to
warm
not
much
of
a
head
to
speak
of
but
that
is
just
a
minor
detraction
from
the
initial
impresion
of
this
beer
a
good
beer
but
possibly
the
third
or
fourth
best
from
great
lakes
try
it
if
you
see
it
it
wont
disappoint

styles

4244444although
it
is
a
lager
i
was
pleasantly
surprised
by
this
beer
it
has
a
full
taste
a
bit
malty
very
bubbly
i
would
say
its
my
favorite
mexican
beer
that
ive
tried
so
far
malty
but
very
skunky
in
aroma
the
flavor
is
clean
and
decently
malty
not
bad
overall
passable
overall
a
lessthandecent
beer
with
a
high
grain
bill
and
a
low
hop
presence
the
carbonation
makes
it
drinkable
but
again
as
a
mexican
beer
the
corny
skunk
does
show
up
and
rears
its
ugly
horns
ill
pass
next
time
but
this
was
a
fun
experience
complete
and
utter
crap
drink
water
instead
clean
crisp
and
light
not
your
typical
light
beer
in
that
its
cleanliness
taste
is
not
muddled
by
sweetness
served
in
a
mug
great
mexican
beer
but
not
my
style
this
is
another
example
of
a
beer
that
is
very
good
when
its
fresh
but
when
not
most
of
the
time
it
tastes
like
you
stuck
a
penny
in
your
mouth
metallic
notes
everywhere

of

when

i
think
this
beer
is
a
little
under
rated
for
the
style
beer
this
is
a
refreshingly
good
beer
especially
in
the
summer
months
crisp
taste
easy
drinking
and
no
bitter
after
taste
makes
a
good
beer
for
the
novice
drinker
one
of
the
better
mexican
beers
no
guinness
at
this
mexican
joint
in
arizona
so
they
poured
me
this
not
a
bad
beer
at
all
ice
cold
and
they
didnt
have
my
irish
brew
bottle
poured
into
a
standard
pint
glass
in
cabo
san
lucas
a
light
coppery

color
with

aroma
is
a
muted
caramel
sweetness
corn

and
white

notes
inoffensive
and
thankfully
lacking
an
obvious
dms
element
still
has
that
inescapable
macrolager
smell
though
body
falls
squarely
in
the
moderate
range
with
excessive
carbonation
taste
is
a
smooth
light
corn
bread
sweetness
coupled
with
the
subtle
grape
notes
from
the
nose
minimal
hop
aroma
or
flavor
i
do
get
a
sultana
raisin
sweet
dried
fruit
note
here
and
there
finishes
fairly
dry
with
a
grainy
astringency
and
a
few
metallic
offflavors
rather
pedestrian
brew
unfortunately
even
if
it
does
represent
the
vestiges
of
a
rather
cool
austriangerman
brewing
tradition
this
one
plays
it
overly
safe
and
still
manages
to
hit
a
few
bum
notes
sorry
this
modelo
produced
lager
was
pretty
good
it
was
a
light
tan
beer
with
a
thin
head
that
disappears
quickly
the
aroma
was
only
slightly
hoppy
but
the
taste
was
crisp
and
refreshing
overall
not
too
good
i
knew
people
who
would
bring
victoria
back
with
them
from
mexico
back
before
it
was
commercially
distributed
in
the
us
i
am
not
going
to
argue
that
it
stacks
up
to
craft
beers
but
if
you
are
looking
for
something
on
a
hot
day
or
something
to
stock
for
a
party
of
non
beer
geeks
this
is
a
solid
choice
dark
gold
to
light
brown
in
color
with
wonderful
clarity
just
a
trace
of
white
head
covers
about
a
third
of
the
top
aroma
is
predominantly
corn
but
there
is
also
light
malt
the
taste
is
similar
to
pacifico
with
corn
being
dominant
theres
a
coppery
hop
bitterness
at
the
very
back
of
the
palate
that
is
prevalent
in
the
fade
the
mouth
is
lightly
carbonated
another
warm
weather
quaffer
from
mexico
by
far
my
favorite
cerveza
from
mexico
not
too
watery
not
to
plain
great
flavor
easy
drinking
and
smooth
smells
like
a
lager
would
but
its
not
worth
skipping
viva
la
mexico
this
is
possibly
the
best
tasting
lager
made
in
mexico
thats
available
but
hard
to
find
in
the
u
s
i
do
not
expect
ale
drinkers
to
ever
give
a
favorable
rating
to
a
lager
or
pilsner
in
the
same
respect
i
will
not
rate
a
heavy
dark
beer
unless
i
liked
it
those
of
you
who
like
the
clean
refreshing
flavor
of
pacifico
mexico
will
likely
find
that
youll
love
victoria
unlike
corona
you
dont
have
to
throw
a
salad
into
it
to
realize
its
beauty
the
malt
has
a
good
amount
of
flavor
with
mild
caramel
in
the
taste
and
there
is
a
slight
buttery
diacetyl
element
with
mild
yeast
flavor
and
practically
no
hop
flavor
this
is
a
pretty
standard
vienna
style
lager
with
mild
malt
and
ok
drinkability
i
could
take
it
or
leave
it
standard
mexican
lager
light
malty
refreshing
and
empty
only
for
summer
only
if
you
thirsty
the
flavor
has
some
mild
toasted
malt
and
biscuit
notes
and
a
clean
hop
finish
it
is
a
beer
that
is
meant
to
be
enjoyed
as
an
adjunct
lager
and
yes
it
was
but
craft
no
way
think
of
it
for
what
it
is
and
it
will
get
better
than
a
poor
rating
i
didnt
mind
it
considering
the
circumstances
and
i
had
two
of
them
for
dinner
so
that
says
something
surprisingly
good
great
taste
no
lime
or
salt
needed
only
down
side
is
availability
not
well
known
so
few
sellers
mexican
beers
tend
to
be
a
little
singular
but
this
one
comes
out
of
left
field
and
is
actually
pretty
good
great
flavor
no
cornyrice
after
taste
found
in
most
mexican
beers
it
isnt
skunky
its
really
decent
good
for
a
nice
session
and
good
at
a
bbq
a
change
of
pace
from
coronas
good
stuff
and
really
not
that
expensive
its
a
good
beer
overall
this
beer
is
listed
as
a
vienna
lager
its
gotta
be
better
than
your
typical
aal
im
glad
some
of
my
family
grabs
this
instead
of
coronas
at
family
gatherings
ill
go
for
one
of
these
if
offered
paired
with
mexican
food
i
might
have
more
than
one
great
from
the
tap
with
some
fresh
mexican
chow
pretty
good
in
a
bottle
on
a
hot
summer
day
hanging
by
the
pool
okay
on
an
average
day
though
nothing
special
its
not
a
strong
beer
it
wont
do
much
for
your
buzz
not
worth
the
price
in
my
opinion
pours
to
a
thin
white
head
and
light
amber
color
aroma
is
mildly
grainy
and
malty
with
a
whiff
of
hops
flavor
is
mild
and
grainy
and
reminiscent
of
corona
and
negra
modelo
mouthfeel
is
decent
overall
a
good
mexican
vienna
that
makes
for
a
good
summer
session
o
its
drinkable
and
it
would
be
nice
on
a
hot
day
o
a
halfway
decent
mexican
brew
o
not
bad
not
great
id
pound
down
a
few
of
these
ice
cold
out
on
the
patio
during
the
summer
cheers
pours
a
clear
amber
in
color
and
much
darker
than
a
corona
a
small
white
fizzy
head
was
seen
but
didnt
last
long
and
settles
to
just
around
the
sides
of
the
boot
some
very
light
lacing
was
seen
but
not
much
the
aroma
is
like
more
other
mexican
beers
just
some
grains
and
malts
but
thats
about
it
the
taste
is
pretty
much
like
the
aroma
with
a
hint
of
some
caramel
malts
sweetness
lots
of
carbonation
overall
just
another
average
mexican
brew
my
pour
netted
me
a
brief
finger
of
fizzy
tawny
head
with
lousy
retention
acting
more
like
pop
and
dissipating
all
too
quickly
color
was
a
deepamber
srm
13
17
with
nequality
clarity
nose
had
a
malty
sweetness
that
made
me
think
that
it
was
other
than
an
aal
i
will
buy
vienna
lager
as
indicated
on
this
site
but
it
was
not
clean
i
was
also
getting
minhaslike
notes
of
bubble
gum
and
dry
cleaning
plant
mouthfeel
was
thintomedium
and
the
taste
was
oddly
unique
or
should
i
say
uniquely
odd
it
had
a
slightly
medicinal
quality
underlying
the
utterly
sweet
malt
flavor
it
was
sugary
with
a
tang
of
hospital
sterilization
if
that
can
be
quantified
by
anyone
else
warming
i
was
getting
a
kind
of
peanut
taste
wtf
the
finish
was
semisweet
with
the
melange
of
off
flavors
getting
the
better
of
the
malt
but
not
in
any
kind
of
good
way
i
have
had
far
worse
and
thanks
to
it
being
available
as
a
single
it
was
a
oneanddone
but
this
was
no
bueno
it
may
be
a
ba
misclassification
but
if
this
is
out
there
in
the
same
market
as
negro
modelo
and
theyre
going
to
claim
the
same
style
this
one
might
as
well
not
even
be
out
there
at
all
negro
isnt
great
beer
but
its
respectable
as
opposed
to
this
beer
overall
i
rate
on
style
and
in
this
case
mexican
lagers
get
thrown
in
for
comparison
and
this
was
pretty
decent
based
on
that
i
imagine
it
tastes
a
whole
lot
better
out
of
the
bottle
on
a
nice
mexican
beach
nothing
to
write
home
about
not
bad
adjunct
lager
cool
looking
bottle
label
has
some
character
not
offensive
good
with
food
another
brew
from
south
of
the
border
that
didnt
quite
cut
it
for
me
out
of
the
bottle
the
beer
had
a
great
dark
amber
color
with
a
perfectly
white
head
to
accent
the
beer
unfortunately
the
head
had
no
staying
power
dissipates
ting
very
fast
and
leaving
no
lacing
to
speak
or
write
about
i
was
very
disappointed
with
the
coppery
scent
of
the
beer
and
was
wary
to
actually
drink
it
but
was
surprised
at
the
decent
flavor
and
mouthfeel
overall
if
you
can
get
past
the
weird
odor
victoria
is
pretty
decent
o
this
beer
doesnt
taste
much
like
a
vienna
lager
and
seems
to
be
more
like
a
sweetened
version
of
an
adjunct
lager
o
the
beer
looks
ok
and
it
smells
like
there
is
malts
in
the
beer
but
when
you
taste
it
its
really
bland
and
theres
not
much
there
to
look
at
for
a
vienna
lager
there
are
definitely
better
beers
that
you
can
find
from
mexico
if
youre
looking
for
something
similar
i
would
suggest
maybe
indio
negra
modelo
or
bohemia
those
have
more
flavor
than
this
plus
ive
seen
these
sell
for
about
26
99
for
a
24
pack
an
insane
price
for
the
quality
that
you
get
thin
and
on
the
watery
side
with
just
some
faint
caramel
and
sweet
malt
would
be
passable
on
a
warm
day
or
if
i
was
actually
in
mexico
eating
some
tacos
with
hot
sauce
besides
that
stay
away
clear
amber
beer
with
med
head
scent
and
flavor
are
similar
with
caramel
and
syrup
notes
weighty
mouthfeel
because
it
is
heavier
on
the
malt
than
the
hops
but
not
cloyingly
so
overal
a
tasty
beer
kind
of
like
a
mexican
shiner
ask
for
this
if
you
were
thinking
about
modelo
negro
its
a
good
alternative
and
one
that
isnt
found
many
places
as
with
many
mexican
lagers
this
beer
works
just
fine
with
a
big
spicy
meal
i
have
been
happy
to
see
this
in
the
states
if
nothing
else
for
its
nostalgic
value
salúd
hulk
this
beer
is
nothing
to
run
home
about
but
not
that
bad
something
i
could
drink
many
of
ok
for
what
it
is
poured
from
a
brown
12
oz
bottle
has
a
amberish
color
with
a
12
inch
head
smell
is
of
grains
bready
taste
is
very
mild
crisp
some
grains
not
exactly
bursting
with
flavor
feels
light
in
the
mouth
and
overall
is
nothing
offensive
but
rather
boring
o
fine
in
cloudycool
oregon
terrific
in
toastysunny
mexico
i
now
get
the
allure
of
simpler
lowalcohol
cervezas
in
a
tropical
climate
an
enjoyable
nononsense
pour
i
liked
it
both
straight
and
mixed
with
lime
and
other
fruits
in
a
michelada
a
good
base
beer
or
a
fine
quaff
on
a
hot
day
i
may
now
look
for
this
at
the
local
tiendas
we
do
have
a
few
here
in
portland
to
enjoy
on
those
hottest
of
summer
days
we
do
have
a
few
of
those
too
im
trying
to
figure
out
in
what
situation
i
would
enjoy
this
beer
over
all
the
beer
is
suppose
to
be
a
veinna
lager
yet
has
no
more
flavor
than
your
average
mass
produced
lager
overall
a
pretty
easy
drinking
session
style
brew
there
is
nothing
great
about
it
but
nothing
really
all
that
bad
just
a
soso
brew
a
drinkable
yet
uninspired
lager
good
to
quench
your
thirst
and
probably
on
par
with
a
classic
budweiser
note
since
i
recently
added
a
beautiful
daughter
to
my
family
and
her
name
is
victoria
i
felt
compelled
to
purchase
this
beer
when
i
saw
it
on
the
shelf
overall
one
of
the
better
beers
to
come
out
of
mexico
its
not
a
lager
thatll
blow
anyones
socks
off
but
the
flavors
are
fine
and
its
got
a
great
mouthfeel
this
one
doesnt
need
the
lime
treatment
victoria
lager
is
a
decent
enough
product
and
it
likely
wont
offend
anyone
but
it
is
quite
unremarkable
and
it
leaves
little
that
is
memorable
try
some
if
you
like
just
dont
expect
to
come
away
from
the
experience
feeling
very
impressed
nice
amber
lager
i
have
good
luck
with
this
beer
it
has
a
nice
aroma
and
a
sweet
and
light
hoppy
taste
great
summer
beer
not
heavy
but
has
a
bit
of
color
and
nice
head
being
from
texas
maybe
we
get
fresher
bottles
i
am
surprised
about
some
of
the
weaker
scores
here
i
have
never
found
this
beer
to
be
flavorless
or
lacking
carbonation
maybe
they
should
complain
to
their
supplier
aroma
is
crisp
malty
and
a
bit
fruity
nothing
special
but
at
least
palatable
it
pours
a
nice
dark
amber
with
a
fairly
thick
though
not
persistent
eggshell
head
flavor
is
malty
and
crisp
a
little
fruity
again
nothing
special
but
better
than
what
i
expected
texture
has
a
good
amount
of
fizz
if
average
body
overall
a
decent
beer
though
its
nothing
spectacular
im
glad
to
see
this
finally
available
north
of
the
border
the
body
was
nicely
typical
good
smooth
and
even
perhaps
a
bit
fuller
than
average
and
was
just
a
wee
bit
sticky
on
the
finish
drinkability
was
good
id
have
a
couple
of
these
on
a
hat
day
at
the
park
or
beach
overall
a
nicely
typical
example
of
the
style
you
can
find
both
better
and
worse
versions
out
there
this
one
is
worth
a
shot
if
you
see
it
poured
into
a
glass
from
the
bottle
actually
looks
very
promising
a
brownamber
color
not
much
head
or
lacing
though
smell
isnt
really
that
pleasant
or
present
not
offensive
just
not
much
there
same
with
taste
what
little
taste
there
is
in
this
beer
isnt
that
great
glad
i
got
this
one
as
a
sample
and
didnt
pay
for
it
wouldnt
turn
it
down
if
someone
handed
one
to
me
at
a
cookout
but
wouldnt
ever
buy
it
in
the
store
if
i
remember
correctly
this
one
was
my
first
beer
in
mexico
so
i
might
have
been
more
generous
than
usual
rather
watereddown
though
clean
and
straightforward
not
bad
though
rather
boring
compared
to
what
the
style
could
be

ok
for

very

for
myself
the

was

bitter
nothing
no

i
felt

i
was
drinking
a

that
just
had
no
heart
or
soul
put
into
it
sad
o
nothing
spectacular
here
though
nothing
offensive
and
id
certainly
recommend
this
over
a
corona
extra
main
downfall
is
that
at
4
this
stuff
is
a
bit
too
close
to
water
certainly
an
option
to
rehydrate
from
the
hot
sun
though
listed
here
as
a
vienna
lager
but
it
seemes
too
light
to
hit
that
style
unimpressive
but
unoffensive
as
well
nice
smoothness
to
the
body
and
while
there
is
a
distinct
corn

it
also
lends
a
pleasant
touch

softens
the

even
with
some
lingering

a

better
mexican
beers
wouldnt
seek
out
again
from
notes
at
a
mexican
restaurant
in
old
town
where
it
was
on
tap
not
much
to
choose
from
and
i
hadnt
heard
of
this
stuff
before
i
would
stick
to
bohemia

the

is
offputting
and
appearance
is

overall
i
thought
this
would
be
slightly
better
than
the
usual
aal
crap
not
sure
why
i
thought
that
its
just
as
bad
if
not
worse
nasty
stuff
and
if
this
is
a
vienna
lager
then
im
santa
claus
o
i
like
a
good
vienna
lager
and
mexico
makes
some
solid
examples
negra
modelo
for
instance
this
is
not
one
of
them
tastes
like
it
could
be
the
light
beer
version
of
dos
equis
amber
just
nothing
going
on
ill
finish
the
bottle
but
im
not
buying
this
again
overall
ill
give
this
a
three
because
its
drinkable
and
nobody
cares
about
mouthfeel
anyway
overall
a
better
brew
that
i
have
tried
from
mexico
i
doesnt
sell
itself
with
lime
or
salt
and
doesnt
require
it
either
i
would
buy
this
beer
for
a
cinco
de
mayo
fest
or
if
i
was
in
mexico
and
my
choices
were
limited
thanks
to
my
friend
jose
for
bringing
it
to
me
for
lunch
break
as
its
a
rarity
that
he
gets
it
from
family
from
mexico
terrible
terriblay
typical
macro
perhaps
ever
worse
absolutely
no
taste
might
as
well
have
been
water
i
drank
5
beers
in
one
hour
and
didnt
feel
or
taste
a
thing
whats
the
point
taste
nothing
almost
like
water
smell
nothing
mouthfeel
slight
carbonation
slight
overall
terrible
fing
beer
im
glad
i
didnt
pay
for
it
id
probably
rather
take
a
bmc
over
this
this
is
the
stuff
im
glad
i
avoided
for
so
long
pass
o
not
worth
the
calories
i
would
gladly
drink
a
number
of
adjunct
lagers
over
this
one
overall
its
a
clean
solid
tasty
beer
not
my
first
pick
maybe
but
my
first
pick
out
of
whats
currently
in
the
fridge
12
oz
from
lifesource
salem
1
35
in
appearance
its
a
light
amber
lager
with
a
sparse
dirty
white
head
aroma
is
strange
certainlly
slightly
toasted
malts
but
some
hops
too
the
strange
part
is
i
get
some
old
style
rubber
band
aromas
taste
is
semisweet
malty
a
hint
of
hops
actually
ok
nice
hot
weather
type
palate
i
liked
this
and
if
on
vacation
in
mexico
this
would
be
an
excellent
choice
overall
not
a
good
beer
for
my
tastes
almost
a
drain
pour
maybe
a
bad
batch
wont
buy
again
o
i
picked
this
up
when
i
was
last
in
dallas
im
going
back
soon
i
wont
be
bringing
this
beer
back
with
me
overall
i
dont
really
enjoy
this
its
mostly
flavorless
overall
a
very
plain
beer
probably
wont
buy
again
its
certainly
better
than
its
stablemates
corona
and
pacifico
but
far
less
spectacular
than
its
instyle
mate
negra
modelo
at
least
i
wont
need
to
spend
two
bucks
in
the
future
for
a
single
bottle
just
to
cure
my
curiosity
mouthfeel
nothing
special
needs
a
lime
or
lemon
way
too
expensive
for
this
product
buy
a
40
ounce
before
you
waste
your
money
on
a
six
pack
it
smells
ok
looks
decent
and
the
taste
is
pretty
good
i
will
say
it
is
a
refreshing
beer
not
the
top
mexican
beer
but
you
may
want
to
try
it
its
pretty
good
victoria
has
a
clear
deep
golden
or
even
amber
appearance
with
some
bubbles
streaming
up
and
a
medium
white
head
the
aroma
is
of
toasted
barley
malt
and
clean
water
and
the
taste
is
also
of
barley
a
light
hop
presence
is
in
play
for
balancing
also
one
detects
a
pleasant
sweetness
mouthfeel
is
light
and
watery
and
victoria
finishes
crisp
refreshing
and
mostly
dry
although
not
as
much
as
american
beers
this
is
a
lowalcohol
yet
enjoyable
mexican
beer
i
certainly
think
its
worth
giving
a
try
rjt
overall
i
quite
like
this
beer
a
nice
mexican
lager
for
me
its
right
up
there
with
dos
equis
amber
and
negra
modelo
for
a
mexican
beer
its
about
average
drink
eh
not
something
i
was
gonna
have
again
for
fiqured
why
not
better
than
i
thought
though
t
the
taste
is
eerily
similar
to
corona
and
theres
not
a
whole
lot
to
like
grain
and
a
slight
bit
of
lemon
but
nothing
worthwhile
overall
its
easy
drinking
and
one
of
the
better
lagers
out
of
mexico
a
good
substitute
to
drinking
the
water
when
on
vacation
south
of
the
border
refers
to
itself
as
being
pilsenervienna
i
guess
i
can
see
that
as
its
falling
in
between
a
lackluster
pilsener
and
a
hohum
vienna
drinkability
is
good
not
going
to
be
mistaken
for
a
german
lager
anytime
soon
though
a
decent
beer
and
a
low
alcohol
one
to
remember
if
you
want
a
beer
at
lunch
while
eating
mexican
food
o
okay
for
what
it
is
a
macro
vienna
lager
but
not
much
there
preferable
to
say
coronoa
sol
or
dos
equious
but
thats
not
saying
much
its
4
00
so
it
is
certainly
a
beer
you
could
session
but
in
a
world
of
so
much
choice
imho
choose
a
more
flavorful
beer
what
would
a
cinco
de
mayo
tasting
be
without
some
brews
from
beneath
the
border
this
one
pours
a
clear
very
pale
straw
topped
by
a
finger
of
white
foam
the
nose
comprises
rice
wheat
light
flowers
and
a
very
light
tinge
of
caramel
the
taste
holds
notes
of
light
wheat
hard
water
flowers
and
a
tinny
twinge
in
the
back
the
body
is
pretty
light
with
a
light
moderate
carbonation
and
a
crisp
finish
overall
this
stuff
is
nice
for
a
watery
lager
but
as
a
vienna
it
falls
pretty
damn
short
of
anything
really
good
compared
to
similar
bottles
though
this
stuff
aint
exactly
horrid
definitely
not
my
favourite
beer
style
but
an
easy
drinking
light
beer
a
decent
choice
for
the
upcoming
lawnmower
season
having
the
same
people
that
make
corona
attempt
a
vienna
lager
is
akin
to
casting
mel
gibson
in
a
remake
of
schindlers
list
its
a
joke
and
a
twisted
one
at
that
its
interesting
that
many
germanic
styles
have
been
preserved
in
mexican
brewing
culture
but
its
unfortunate
that
that
culture
now
lay
in
the
hands
of
grupo
modelo
and
like
breweries
picked
up
from
beercart
on
beer
friday
at
work
poured
into
a
plastic
cup
amber
colored
very
clear
with
no
hint
of
a
head
upon
the
pour
aroma
is
nearly
nonexistent
a
faint
hint
of
grainy
malt
flavor
is
very
bland
theres
some
light
caramel
maltiness
bitterness
is
very
low
but
there
are
no
off
flavors
either
no
corniness
an
extremely
inoffensive
beer
and
i
find
that
offensive
growing
up
ive
always
heard
the
stories
of
things
here
being
better
in
mexico
not
the
water
of
course
but
mostly
edibles
like
coke
shrimp
cocktails
and
of
course
corona
weve
all
heard
the
stories
of
the
clear
corona
bottles
however
in
mexico
corona
is
distributed
in
brown
bottles
making
the
overall
taste
a
little
better
sure
its
not
pty
but
then
again
this
is
america
a
place
where
all
things
merge
together
to
form
pieces
of
art
like
fusion
cuisine
or
megan
fox
making
our
land
a
canvas
for
craft
brewers
so
when
i
saw
the
ads
for
this
beer
i
was
extremely
happy
sure
i
didnt
see
an
amazing
craft
brew
but
i
saw
a
new
standard
of
cerveza
in
the
states
go
try
one
for
yourself
and
be
sure
to
have
a
good
time
with
a
little
jugo
de
sanchez
mix
or
some
lemon
and
salt
no
need
to
be
a
snob
about
mejicos
beer
scene
theyre
not
telling
you
to
pour
this
in
your
snifter
you
know
however
if
its
mexican
craft
brew
you
seek
please
look
up
groupo
cucapa
stay
thirsty
my
friends
md
very
light
and
refreshing
well
carbonated
but
appropriate
for
the
style
finishing
dry
and
clean
with
no
funk
aftertaste
that
a
lot
of
other
mexi
beers
have
without
a
doubt
an
all
night
drinker
and
especially
with
a
low
abv
of
4
overall
definitely
worth
a
shot
o
misses
some
style
points
but
nothing
terribly
wrong
very
drinkable
overall
just
nothing
special
aggressive
pour
only
gets
you
about
half
a
finger
of
mixed
bubble
size
head
pure
white
lacks
meaningful
retention
as
well
as
lacing
the
liquid
is
a
blend
of
browns
and
yellows
based
in
orange
has
a
metallic
sheen
which
brightens
it
some
clear
on
the
whole
a
few
lazy
bubbles
meandering
here
and
there
basic
nose
of
grains
wheat
straw
and
then
banana
and
corn
mild
presence
of
flowers
and
peach
apple
fruit
nothing
really
stands
out
from
the
pack
while
uninteresting
equally
inoffensive
mediumbodied
for
its
overall
weight
comes
across
as
dense
and
unyielding
were
it
not
for
the
charge
put
into
it
by
the
carbonation
you
might
not
feel
it
move
the
initial
sweetness
provided
by
the
banana
yeast
clove
flowers
and
corn
fades
in
the
face
of
wheat
germ
rye
and
dried
brown
straw
lowgrade
mixed
white
citrus
and
stone
fruits
more
dirt
than
earthiness
increasingly
metallic
through
the
finish
not
much
more
to
say
lacks
the
native
complexity
to
elicit
further
prose
the
flavor
is
quite
nice
however
with
characteristics
of
sweet
corn
and
light
caramel
that
are
expected
from
a
mexicanstyle
lager
but
there
is
very
little
of
the
metallic
graininess
that
most
of
the
adjunctladen
mexilagers
suffer
from
as
a
result
this
beer
is
an
improvement
over
many
of
the
other
options
available
at
most
mexican
eateries
but
it
still
did
a
fine
job
cutting
through
the
savory
spice
of
the
food
o
while
this
isnt
terribly
offensive
it
wasnt
very
flavorful
either
o
overall
not
a
bad
drinker
but
certainly
not
worth
the
premium
price
for
which
its
been
selling
the
abovementioned
negra
modelo
is
easily
as
enjoyable
and
more
economical
the
sourness
in
the
flavor
starts
to
become
more
distracting
after
a
couple
probably
be
hidden
when
paired
with
food
o
very
drinkable
not
a
bad
brew
needs
some
tacos
to
go
with
it
i
had
been
waiting
for
this
beer
to
be
imported
to
the
states
for
a
very
long
time
best
mexican
beer
out
there
100
times
better
than
that
bullshit
corona
overall
i
think
this
is
one
of
my
favorite
beers
i
would
recommend
for
everyone
to
atlas
try
this
beer
once
you
will
love
it
no
doubt
about
it
whats
up
girlfriend
happy
40th
yeah
baby
so
my
sons
hockey
team
manager
turns
the
big
40
yikes
they
have
the
soirée
at
a
nville
saloon
on
tap
is
victoria
i
said
hey
man
come
down
here
he
said
what
you
want
i
said
i
want
to
try
the
victoria
and
i
am
glad
i
did
this
beer
is
the
best
mexican
beer
i
have
ever
tasted
it
doesnt
have
that
mexican
i
need
a
lime
bullsht
there
wasnt
much
aroma
but
the
taste
and
color
were
very
good
did
i
session
f
yeah
i
did
drinkability
easy
drinking
not
complex
enough
to
stay
interested
but
beats
the
hell
out
of
american
adjuncts
lightly
sweet
in
flavor
with
some
watery
caramel
notes
bit
thin
in
the
middle
and
with
a
bit
of
vienna
maltiness
on
the
finish
feel
is
decent
but
in
keeping
with
the
light
approach
to
the
style
decent
drink
given
its
lack
of
complexity
tastes
like
a
corona
with
some
added
specialty
malts
though
not
enough
to
give
it
any
real
character
d
this
beer
is
unremarkable
but
fairly
refreshing
its
lightness
makes
it
an
easy
drinker
theres
a
touch
more
flavor
going
on
than
in
most
mainstream
mexican
beers
overall
a
light
version
of
a
vienna
lager
hop
bitterness
comes
on
stronger
than
a
bmc
pilsner
but
not
to
the
level
expected
of
a
vienna
lager
one
of
the
better
mexican
beers
i
have
had
which
still
doesnt
make
it
great
poured
into
a
pint
glass
it
has
a
thick
light
tan
head
and
is
very
bubbly
the
head
dissipates
quickly
forming
a
thin
tan
crust
on
top
of
the
body
with
no
lacing
the
body
is
crystal
clear
and
is
a
semi
dark
bronze
color
with
some
good
carbonation
you
can
smell
some
very
light
alcohol
aromas
mixed
in
with
some
wheat
but
not
much
else
the
mouth
feel
is
very
light
with
mild
malt
flavors
and
some
mild
wheat
flavors
as
well
but
not
much
else
this
is
a
good
simple
beer
pours
an
amber
orange
color
with
a
mild
malts
scent
the
taste
starts
rather
bold
with
different
grain
but
subsides
shortly
after
very
litte
carbonation
making
the
texture
feel
rather
thin
a
simple
beer
for
people
looking
for
some
simple
nothing
too
special
here
the
beer
pours
a
yellow
color
with
a
white
head
the
aroma
is
grain
and
grass
with
not
too
much
else
going
on
the
flavor
is
more
of
the
same
i
get
a
lot
of
grain
and
grass
with
some
very
sweet
malt
in
there
as
well
medium
carbonation
and
medium
mouthfeel
extremely
simple
but
actually
not
too
bad
better
than
expected
its
finally
available
on
the
texas
side
of
the
rio
grande
at
least
in
the
rgv
better
than
corona
or
dos
equis
but
thats
not
saying
much
good
drinkability
descent
hops
given
a
choice
id
rather
have
pacifico
or
barrilitos
but
this
isnt
bad
very
good
drinking
beer
bought
one
for
me
and
my
father
paid
25
bucks
for
both
40oz
bottles
herd
stories
from
the
old
folks
about
this
beer
when
i
was
growing
up
they
swore
that
beers
today
dont
compare
to
the
unpasturised
beer
that
victoria
is
they
said
they
could
even
drink
this
beer
at
room
temperature
which
i
came
to
find
out
is
very
true
and
ill
stick
with
the
old
folks
knowledge
since
theyve
been
around
longer
than
me
so
cheer
this
is
mexicos
bet
keep
secret
drinkability
cold
and
wet
you
will
wonder
if
you
are
drinking
beer
nice
almost
amber
color
darker
than
any
other
mexican
lagers
which
are
usually
yellow
enormous
foamy
head
which
sticks
around
and
tenacious
thin
lacing
smells
like
your
basic
high
quality
adjunct
beer
corn
husk
grain
faint
lemon
salt
water
flavors
are
also
of
the
hq
adjunct
variety
bread
corn
slight
tart
fruit
some
nice
caramel
malt
flavors
and
more
of
a
pronounced
hops
flavor
than
most
with
a
dry
finish
all
in
all
nothing
special
but
definitely
nothing
bad
either
its
a
hotrod
version
of
a
macro
lager
a
cut
above
but
just
a
small
cut
theyre
marketing
this
as
a
kind
of
mexican
premium
beer
and
the
price
is
way
too
high
for
what
you
get
this
is
priced
alongside
microbrews
at
10
a
six
pack
should
be
7
max
not
really
worth
the
price
which
bugs
me
if
ba
had
a
value
category
id
give
this
a
2
0
super
high
carbonation
makes
this
really
crisp
but
the
body
is
more
watery
than
water
itself
this
is
a
really
thin
beer
one
of
the
worst
mexican
beers
i
have
had
if
you
want
something
in
this
style
in
mexico
grab
a
bohemia
or
a
negra
modelo
this
beer
sucks
crisp
clean
taste
carbonic
bite
a
bit
fizzy
mild
hint
of
apple
and
crackery
malt
in
a
brown
bottle
no
detectable
skunk
fairly
dry
aftertaste
easy
enough
to
drink
without
thinking
about
it
but
not
really
flavorful
or
memorable
at
all
the
kind
of
beer
that
would
improve
with
a
lime
in
it
unfortunately
i
really
think
some
of
my
beer
bretheren
should
give
this
beer
another
try
since
it
is
finally
available
in
the
us
right
now
its
only
available
in
chicago
but
hopefully
it
wll
move
its
way
to
los
angeles
and
dallas
you
could
pound
down
a
bunch
of
these
and
not
feel
much
but
if
youre
looking
for
a
good
tasting
mexican
vienna
lager
leave
this
one
on
the
shelf
and
get
some
negro
modelo
instead
certainly
thirst
quenching
for
those
hot
mexican
days
but
really
doesnt
belong
in
the
conversation
with
yuengling
or
negra
modelo
if
anyone
has
acess
to
any
other
mexican
40oz
please
send
me
a
message
avoid
this
beer
i
dont
know
how
this
could
have
possible
earned
a
b
i
would
drink
a
6pack
of
corona
without
the
lime
before
i
drank
another
one
of
these
its
that
bad
not
so
harddrinking
though
since
this
is
usually
the
next
best
thing
to
corona
its
tolerable
that
said
this
one
is
crappy
but
doesnt
taste
like
seawater
and
actually
comes
in
a
dark
bottle
in
the
appearance
is
a
copper
color
poor
head
of
foam
and
some
bubbles
due
to
the
high
carbonation
the
smell
is
fresh
some
essences
of
roasted
malts
and
carbonation
in
the
are
roasted
maltas
and
caramel
some
carbonation
again
too
the
mouthfeel
have
a
little
bitterness
and
a
very
refreshing
end
beside
the
high
carbonation
again
in
the
drinkability
its
good
with
the
food
or
for
parties
but
sometimes
i
feel
is
apple
soda
light
to
medium
bodied
this
one
has
taste
compared
to
the
others
same
caramel
cookie
some
hoppy
bite
nothing
in
your
face
nothing
spectacular
but
tasty
and
the
best
option
i
found
around
small
offwhite
head
doesnt
last
for
long
clear
copperorange
in
color
the
smell
kind
of
reminds
me
of
a
german
marzenbier
caramel
malts
with
a
little
bit
of
floral
hops
really
good
stuff
this
is
one
of
the
best
mexican
beers
ive
ever
had
d
tasty
goes
down
easily
not
too
filling
very
mild
kick
good
representation
of
style
this
is
a
decent
beer
with
substance
that
is
worth
drinking
for
a
while
last
summer
i
went
on
a
cruise
to
mexico
with
family
and
friends
and
before
we
got
back
on
the
boat
in
ixtapazihuatanejo
not
sure
which
city
it
was
they
were
the
same
port
but
anyways
there
was
a
dollar
beer
stand
with
corona
and
this
victoria
we
went
for
the
victoria
because
it
was
darker
and
we
had
never
seen
it
before
it
was
surprisingly
good
i
have
never
seen
it
since
we
wiped
out
the
supply
that
the
lady
and
her
kids
were
selling
d
certainly
a
session
beer
despite
the
comments
picked
up
a
940ml
bottle
for
the
beach
for
about
15
pesos
not
bad
for
beer
that
doesnt
suck
like
most
of
the
big
mexican
lagers
this
is
fairly
mellow
in
flavor
its
got
a
decent
aroma
of
caramel
and
barley
the
flavor
is
pretty
similar
but
not
as
strong
and
a
little
sweeter
and
fruitier
not
a
bad
choice
for
a
vacation
goes
well
with
mexican
food
this
is
a
very
basic
beer
with
a
bland
lager
taste
a
lot
like
sol
in
a
way
it
goes
down
nicely
and
doesnt
leave
much
of
an
aftertaste
although
not
very
strong
it
yields
a
satisfying
buzz
probably
due
to
the
fact
that
i
drank
about
three
litres
of
it
its
pretty
cheap
too
so
in
summation
ill
say
its
a
decent
beer
to
get
if
youre
low
on
cash
standing
undecided
in
front
of
the
cooler
at
a
mexican
711
five
minutes
before
midnight
when
they
stop
selling
alcohol
this
brew
poured
to
a
deep
golden
color
showing
a
fair
amount
of
carbonation
had
a
white
head
that
was
medium
in
size
but
does
break
down
quickly
leaving
a
very
fain
trace
of
any
lace
on
the
side
of
the
glass
this
brew
is
actually
quite
nice
smelling
malt
seem
to
come
out
as
well
as
nice
sweet
aroma
over
all
not
a
bad
smelling
brew
but
not
overly
exciting
did
not
have
the
skunky
characteristics
that
a
number
of
the
other
mexican
brews
showed
the
taste
is
good
nice
malt
flavors
mixed
in
with
a
little
hop
flavor
at
the
tail
end
and
good
carbonation
this
brew
was
one
of
my
favorites
while
on
vacation
very
drinkable
with
its
taste
carbonation
as
well
as
the
4
abv
overall
this
is
a
good
brew
not
sure
i
will
run
out
trying
to
track
it
down
while
in
the
states
but
one
i
would
definitely
look
for
while
back
in
mexico
salud
pretty
light
lager
mouthfeel
hops
aftertaste
is
quite
nice
i
could
drink
quite
a
few
of
these
as
far
as
macros
go
this
is
a
very
solid
beer
a
beer
bad
classified
is
a
vienna
lager
not
a
marzen
oktoberfest
how
ever
a
beer
made
only
for
the
domestic
market
special
for
the
mexican
quesadillas
and
bbq
recommended
with
german
cuisine
too
its
bitterness
and
strong
flavro
make
this
beer
favorite
for
mexicans
in
its
bottle
etternaly

salud
pours
with
a
decent
white
head
settling
over
clear
deep
gold
gently
carbonated
liquid
the
nose
is
nothing
more
than
light
maltiness
the
taste
as
well
is
very
light
with
notes
of
brief
grassy
malt
before
drying
out
with
a
nice
amount
of
hop
bitterness
a
slightly
above
average
mexican
lager
consumed
in
october
2004
in
cancun
mexico
from
a
bottle
pours
with
a
pretty
nice
head
and
a
bit
of
lacing
suprised
me
considering
the
rest
all
disappeared
with
a
blink
of
the
eye
smells
of
malt
corn
maybe
rice
fill
the
air
a
bit
of
a
hop
smell
too
definite
hop
tatse
with
the
malt
background
this
would
be
a
decent
beer
to
choose
while
having
dinner
fairly
easy
to
drink
one
of
the
better
ones
down
here
but
still
nothing
even
close
to
brag
about
i
recently
sampled
this
beer
while
vacationing
in
cozumel
mexico
it
was
a
decent
beer
typical
of
most
mexican
beers
in
my
opinion
light
and
easy
drinking
nothing
really
special
about
it
although
it
does
make
a
great
beer
to
chill
on
the
beach
and
drink
decent
mouthfeel
with
very
good
drinkabliltiy
while
not
a
world
beater
this
was
one
of
the
best
beers
i
was
able
to
find
in
cancun
seems
to
have
good
distribution
it
is
worth
a
try
it
is
smooth
and
medium
bodied
a
bit
over
carbonated
but
it
finds
its
way
down
easy
i
did
notice
some
inconsistencies
from
beer
to
beer
maybe
storage
problems
or
the
brewery
is
not
able
to
continually
be
accurate
still
i
enjoyed
this
beer
definitely
one
of
the
better
mexican
beers
this
one
actually
has
some
tint
to
it
it
is
really
easy
to
drink
and
tastes
like
a
riceywatery
malt
mix
i
dont
think
it
is
as
good
as
the
negra
modelo
or
indio
so
at
this
point
you
may
envision
victoria
as
a
decent
alternative
to
corona
with
a
little
color
this
beer
saved
my
trip
down
to
playa
del
carmen
mx
it
is
the
only
darker
beer
i
could
find
and
i
use
the
term
loosely
pours
a
little
browner
than
a
lager
with
a
thin
head
and
little
lacing
the
smell
is
sweet
with
some
hoppiness
the
flavor
and
mouthfeel
was
existent
great
for
a
mexican
beer
this
beer
is
actually
very
good
however
after
8
days
in
mexico
i
noticed
inconsistency
which
may
not
be
the
brewerys
fault
the
brown
bottle
is
also
a
welcome
sight
in
an
area
that
is
not
overly
concerned
with
storage
issues
one
of
the
few
decent
mexican
beers
i
have
been
able
to
find
maybe
not
quite
as
good
as
negra
modelo
which
isnt
really
saying
too
much
but
along
the
same
lines
and
a
decent
alternative
on
the
scale
of
mexican
beers
this
is
in
the
upper
echelon
but
it
really
does
not
stand
up
against
other
more
readily
available
viennas
i
would
go
with
an
elliot
ness
here
in
the
states
but
this
one
is
worth
a
shot
if
you
are
in
mexico
with
only
corona
and
sol
as
your
other
options
decent
enough
better
than
regular
corona
would
do
in
a
pinch
great
taste
while
its
ice
chilled
and
pretty
damn
average
aftertaste
best
mexican
beer
alongside
with
pacificos
a
corona
in
a
larger
version
with
amber
bottle
that
protects
the
beer
better
than
usual
corona
in
a
transparent
bottle
quite
delightful
pretty
watery
and
light
on
any
kind
of
flavor
o
this
is
a
step
up
from
corona
but
thats
not
saying
much
not
a
bad
beach
beer
but
definitely
nothing
to
write
hope
about
i
was
sitting
in
a
mexican
grocery
eating
a
tripe
and
tongue
taco
and
noticed
this
in
the
cooler
i
figured
i
would
enhance
the
experience
by
drinking
a
real
mexican
beer
no
glass
to
serve
it
in
i
drank
it
straight
from
the
32
ounce
bottle
hence
the
higher
score
in
appearance
the
nose
and
flavor
is
straight
rice
with
a
hint
of
barley
graininess
after
i
poured
a
little
lime
juice
in
it
the
flavor
did
improve
but
the
base
beer
is
poor
and
weak
it
served
the
purpose
as
its
light
character
helped
to
extinguish
the
habenero
spiciness
but
i
wouldnt
bother
to
drink
it
again
pours
a
golden
yellow
in
color
and
is
darker
than
they
regular
corona
extra
that
you
see
all
the
time
has
a
good
1finger
white
head
that
settles
down
quickly
to
just
around
the
sides
of
the
glass
some
spotty
lacing
is
seen
but
not
a
lot
the
aroma
is
typical
of
a
mexican
beer
with
just
some
grains
and
hops
nothing
that
stands
out
really
tastes
pretty
much
like
a
regular
corona
extra
with
a
higher
alcohol
content
with
a
sweeter
slightly
dry
finish
overall
all
is
was
ok
cheers
mr
anderson
overall
looks
and
smells
like
corona
extra
this
beer
however
as
a
slightly
harsher
taste
than
the
extra
this
brew
is
inferior
to
corona
extra
overall
pretty
darn
drinkable
the
lack
of
adjunct
offflavors
makes
me
think
this
isnt
a
normal
adjunct
lager
although
again
its
definitely
not
a
vienna
lager
for
beers
that
you
buy
at
the
gas
station
in
a
quart
bottle
its
actually
not
bad
i
have
made
the
appropriate
adjustments
in
the
score
fine
for
what
it
is
was
an
adequate
beverage
to
go
with
that
greasy
burrito
de
pollo
there
is
some
debate
about
the
difference
between
corona
extra
and
familiar
so
i
had
to
try
a
bottle
although
it
does
taste
fresher
it
does
not
taste
like
a
vienna
style
lager
and
the
brown
bottle
could
impact
the
flavor
the
label
did
state
6
abv
but
according
to
the
local
distributor
website
origlio
beverage
familiar
is
4
6
abv
the
same
as
extra
packaged
in
a
larger
bottle
httpwww
origlio
comcrown
php
since
i
am
an
organic
chemist
with
access
to
analytical
techniques
i
checked
it
out
in
the
lab
and
found
it
is
in
fact
a
little
less
than
5
abv
not
6
as
listed
on
the
bottle
and
here
at
ba
thus
it
is
most
likely
the
same
product
as
corona
extra
in
any
case
it
does
taste
fresher
than
extra
but
comes
at
a
price
higher
than
i
am
willing
to
shell
out
for
a
beer
of
this
level
of
flavor
i
will
likely
never
buy
it
again
overall
actually
despite
the
low
rating
this
is
pretty
drinkable
compared
to
corona
extra
its
certainly
no
worse
than
any
other
adjunct
lager
out
there
my
goto
refreshing
brew
no
lime
necessary
overall
it
has
a
bit
more
flavor
than
the
extra
still
works
well
with
some
limes
which
i
added
on
the
2nd
half
taste
was
full
of
corn
and
metal
like
some
cheesy
band
with
a
fake
scary
flyer
i
think
if
you
take
a
regular
corona
some
mineral
water
and
a
sam
adams
light
blend
them
together
you
get
this
beer
i
think
you
can
get
a
little
more
alcohol
taste
to
it
its
better
than
any
other
corona
ive
ever
had
and
hey
you
dont
have
to
drink
as
much
of
it
to
get
a
buzz
lawnmower
or
memory
road
stuff
at
best
overall
this
is
a
good
thirst
quencher
yet
id
choose
bohemia
or
some
other
mexican
beer
if
im
needed
a
fast
cold
one
on
a
hot
day
o
much
better
than
corona
extra
brown
bottle
keeps
the
skunk
out
o
overall
it
was
alright
definitely
not
a
vienna
lager
but
its
better
than
regular
corona
by
a
long
shot
i
really
thought
that
this
was
regular
corona
in
a
really
cool
quartsized
bottle
and
i
bought
it
purely
for
the
novelty
factor
turns
out
that
this
is
like
coronaplus
a
more
medium
bodied
and
much
more
flavorful
lager
maybe
should
be
under
the
vienna
lager
style
here
on
ba
i
think
it
might
be
corona
extra
just
stored
in
the
brown
bottle
changes
the
taste
its
not
bad
will
have
again
this
is
a
great
pilsner
hard
to
find
it
is
not
bitter
not
a
dark
beer
and
not
an
ale
so
dont
rate
it
as
one
a
decent
light
tasting
amber
o
i
enjoy
this
brew
as
a
laid
back
session
beer
low
abv
solid
flavor
doesnt
really
get
old
this
is
a
go
to
for
a
classic
american
beer
drink
it
while
listening
to
a
little
dylan
on
a
warm
summer
night
and
you
might
just
appreciate
it
d
as
far
as
vienna
lagers
go
this
one
is
pretty
tasty
appearance
and
aroma
were
not
impressive
but
this
is
a
good
sessionable
lager
at
a
good
price
drinkability
i
have
a
hard
time
believing
this
is
a
vienna
nothing
offensive
here
but
certainly
nothing
worth
returning
to
either
mouthfeel
is
light
and
crisp
finishes
clean
this
would
be
easy
to
session
and
an
ideal
alternative
to
a
standard
american
lager
pours

feel
is
smooth
and
crisp
with
an
average
carbonation
level
tastes
of
yeast
pale
hops
sweet

and
slight

overall
nothing
special
but
a
rather
decent
vienna
pours
a
clear
amber
color
with
some
lacing
it
has
a
bready
malty
smell
with
some
spice
the
taste
is
thin
with
some
hopspice
and
malt
a
little
grassy
taste
but
not
memorable
the
mouth
feel
is
thin
and
light
this
is
not
one
ill
buy
but
one
to
try
i
guess
a
boring
brew
for
me
but
i
know
alot
of
people
that
would
enjoy
the
hell
out
of
this
style
da
pleasant
easydrinking
brew
a
lighter
body
than
one
may
expect
considering
the
rather
hearty
aroma
very
sessionable
mfd
nice
carbonation
medlight
in
body
for
a
vienna
and
exceptionally
drinkable
for
its
style
i
had
james
page
on
tap
at
a
hotel
in
st
paul
mn
thats
the
only
place
ive
ever
seen
it
im
in
nd
or
even
heard
about
it
but
i
tell
you
what
its
an
excellent
beer
its
a
darker
lager
with
a
bit
of
a
sweet
taste
i
like
dark
beers
and
i
really
like
james
page
amber
lager
if
you
get
a
chance
to
try
it
out
do
it
pours
a
clear
amber
color
with
a
large
white
head
that
had
decent
retention
moderate
amount
of
lacing
is
left
on
the
glass
mild
hop
aroma
but
it
is
evident
with
earthy
and
spice
hints
i
detect
a
hint
of
diactyl
nice
malt
base
is
the
strong
point
in
the
flavor
the
hops
i
was
expecting
from
the
aroma
kind
of
fall
away
in
the
taste
just
hints
of
noble
hops
in
the
finish
again
i
detect
a
little
diactyl
light
body
and
moderately
carbonated
nice
texture
to
this
lighter
bodied
beer
probably
the
best
james
page
beer
and
is
very
sessionable
one
of
the
better
vienna
lagers
i
have
sampled
overall
not
to
bad
but
not
great
the
mouth
feel
is
kinda
mouth
coating
but
slightly
powdery
d
it
is
a
good
session
beer
with
a
low
abv
light
body
and
balanced
and
nonobtrusive
flavors
overall
just
an
average
amber
overall
i
dont
know
if
ill
buy
this
again
but
its
not
too
bad
bottle
from
park
lane
liquor
in
lancaster
ca
bottle
states
it
is
from
minneapolis
mn
the
beer
pours
a
glowing
orangeamber
color
with
a
minimal
offwhite
head
that
bubbles
away
to
nothing
immediately
lacing
is
virtually
nonexistent
tart
fruit
and
light
malt
aroma
mediumbodied
with
a
tart
fruit
and
pungent
malt
flavor
that
makes
me
wonder
if
this
beer
predates
the
stevens
point
ownership
very
little
hops
are
present
the
finish
is
fruity
cough
medicine
pass
kind
of
a
boring
one
dimensional
beer
nothing
that
would
make
me
want
to
try
it
again
presentation
was
in
a
12oz
bottle
and
produced
a
large
head
with
an
amber
almost
ruby
in
color
there
was
a
huge
sweet
malty
aroma
that
staied
there
through
the
inital
taste
with
a
strong
yeasty
bready
flavor
there
wasnt
too
much
hop
flavor
for
my
oppinion
there
was
way
too
much
carbonation
for
the
style
it
has
the
amout
of
carbonation
you
would
see
in
a
secondary
fermention
the
was
no
indication
of
that
or
in
a
beer
like
a
belgan
blonde
the
over
high
carbnation
distracted
from
the
over
all

doesnt
stay
too
long
but
it
doesnt
drop
off
immediately
either
towards
the
end
you
seem
to
notice
some
flaws
in
its
degree
of
smoothness
which
brings
down
the
drinkability
drinkability
safe
nothing
objectionable
just
average

rich
flavor
substantial
mouthfeel
all
in
all
a
fine
example
of
a
style
that
is
not
inherently
all
that
adventurous
this
is
a
surprisingly
good
vienna
lager
truthfully
i
didnt
expect
a
whole
lot
from
this
brew
but
its
a
pleasant
surprise
i
dont
run
into
this
style
too
often
but
this
is
a
good
example
i
used
to
drink
alot
of
this
beer
i
always
enjoyed
it
but
it
isnt
as
good
as
i
remember
it
i
am
not
sure
if
that
has
something
to
do
with
point
brewing
it
now
or
the
fact
that
my
tastes
have
evolved
not
much
head
retention
here
without
much
lacing
aroma
is
pretty
much
nonexsistant
flavor
is
ok
quite
malty
with
a
touch
of
a
genaric
hop
flavor
this
beer
is
still
an
extremely
drinkable
session
beer
but
it
isnt
one
that
i
am
going
to
reach
for
unless
the
selection
is
weak
the
mouthfeel
is
fairly
dry
and
crisp
the
body
is
light
none
too
drinkable
though
im
glad
i
only
got
a
single
drinkability
is
well
ask
my
12
pack
drinkability
is
ok
i
like
the
nuttiness
but
as
with
most
ambers
im
not
impressed
enough
to
seek
this
out
a
very
good
goto
beer
as
a
side
bar
the
flight
attendant
gave
me
3
cans
as
i
got
off
the
plane
for
our
sampling
group
to
savor
in
a
can
on
a
plane
in
a
plastic
cup
is
how
i
enjoyed
this
little
brew
no
freshness
dating
to
be
seen
poured
clear
light
amber
sporting
a
decent
looking
off

that

extra
pale

i
was
pretty

about

it
may
be
nothing
more
than
the
circumstances
surrounding
the
consumption
of
each
but
iron
range
strikes
me
as
a
better
beer
ill
be
sure
to
keep
an
eye
out
for
more
from
this
brewery
whenever
i
next
take
a
trip
up
madison
way
head
that
dissappers
rapidley
to
nothing
not
much
carbonation
either
mouthfeel
is
a
little
slick
and
it
goes
down
pretty
good
with
a
very
slightly
dry
finish
taste
is
good
for
this
style
and
i
would
recommend
giving
this
brew
a
try
poured
from
a
can
this
beer
is
a
clear
amberbronze
color
with
an
averagewhite
head
the
aroma
is
somewhat
enticinga
little
caramel
malt
a
little
grain
some
lightly
toasted
malts
theres
very
little
hops
in
the
aroma
the
taste
is
similar
this
is
a
very
maltcentric
beer
the
malt
flavor
though
is
very
light
slight
extremely
slight
hop
bitter
in
the
finish
moderate
carbonation
and
a
moderate
but
solidly
appropriate
mouthfeel
the
brew
does
produce
a
minor
slickness
on
the
tongue
its
enjoyable
and
fairly
flavorful
its
definitely
more
than
i
expected
di
like
it
smooth
and
very
drinkable
it
reminds
me
a
of
a
slightly
flat
samuel
adams
boston
lager
i
expect
this
would
be
good
with
spicy
foods
12
ounce
bottle
pours
out
a
dark
amber
color
with
a
small
head
stale
corn
and
cooked
veggie
aroma
a
little
bit
of
caramel
flavor
but
mainly
this
beer
has
the
same
cooked
veggie
flavor
as
in
the
aroma
perhaps
a
bit
of
fruitiness
no
hop
flavor
mouthfeel
is
medium
poor
drinkability
i
really
enjoyed
their
pale
ale
so
this
beer
was
a
real
disappointment
tastes
like
macro
crap
for
a
second
after
just
retrying
pages
voyaguer
epa
i
thought
the
move
brought
some
recipe
tweaking
nope
this
is
as
pesdestrian
as
ever
and
maybe
even
worse
than
i
remember
good
crossover
brew
for
the
less
adventurous
a
smooth
malty
vienna
lager
this
beer
is
a
true
european
red
with
100
tworow
malted
barley
spalter
hops
and
munich
malts
german
lager
yeast
and
a
minimum
six
weeks
of
cool
cellaring
a
little
hoppy
but
not
much
depth
seems
thin
aroma
lacks
but
has
smooth
and
malty
tones
throughout
excellent
complex
finish
with
a
sweet
aftertaste
warm
these
guys
are
out
of
business
now
but
the
stevens
point
brewery
seems
to
be
picking
them
up
although
i
havent
seen
anything
new
on
the
shelves
in
this

clear
light
copper

big
white

dissipates
to
a
solid
layer
of

on

of
the

is
carmel
malt
through
and
through
maybe
a
little
biscuit
and
alcohol
scent
also
flavor
is
also
carmel
malt
and
a
solid
hops
backing
flavorful
and
a
thicker
mouthfeel
for
a
lager
very
good
overall
its
good
boot
not
great
worth
a
try
particularly
if
you
like
the
clean
taste
of
lagers
and
the
hopy
yet
sweet
balance
of
an
american
brown
ale
petes
wicked
ale
for
example
in
minnesota
you
might
find
this
beer
offered
at
weddings
or
other
open
bars
and
its
a
fine
choice
for
the
masses
but
i
need
something
more
flavor
is
full
bodied
and
malty
some
caramel
and
woody
flavors
mild
hopping
in
the
finish
giving
it
a
crisp
dryness
medium
carbonation
very
slight
alcoholic
sweetness
in
the
finish
much
like
a
single
malt
a
rather
nice
beer
and
a
good
marzen
with
a
lot
of
character
pours
out
a
clear
amberishcopper

medium
foamy

down
to
very
thin

light
toasted

vienna
in
style
earth
and
grass
hoppiness
is
detected
also
tastes
sort
of
bockish
in
nature
one
dimensional
without
a
real
flavor
that
sticks
out
i
can
detect
the
munich
malts
but
its
thin
in
fact
the
whole
mouthfeel
seems
thin
not
watery
thin
but
flavorless
thin
a
bit
of
earthy
hoppiness
can
be
found
too
im
sorry
to
say
that
jp
iron
range
amber
lager
is
nothing
but
a
crossover
beer
and
nothing
more
id
drink
it
if
it
was
offered
but
i
wont
be
spending
my
on
this
again

an

they
dont
work
well
with

not
a
good
complementthe
hops
to
the
malt
overall
i
wouldnt
buy
this
one
again
but
would
drink
it
if
someone
offered
to
me
out
of
their
fridge
this
clear
amber
beer
throws
out
a
hefty
white
head
that
is
well
retained
nice
malty
aroma
tainted
with
some
slight
spicy
hop
notes
taste
is
a
nice
blend
of
hops
and
malt
but
nothing
above
the
norm
some
vienna
malt
notes
are
noticeable
some
munich
malt
notes
as
well
if
im
not
mistaken
noble
hops
make
their
presence
slightly
throughout
the
beer
this
medium
bodied
beer
is
drinkable
but
not
one
of
my
favorites
pretty
average
clear
brown
with
odd
grayish
head
light
hops
on
the
nose
on
thick
malt
backbone
taste
is
good
malt
with
hint
of
caramel
floral
hops
play
in
the
background
good
match
with
pretzels
brings
out
the
malt
never
heard
of
this
beer
until
a
stewardess
recommended
i
try
one
had
4
cans
on
a
flight
to
detroit
from
st
louis
its
caramelly
malt
flavor
produced
quite
a
surprise
since
this
is
a
canned
beer
1999
a
heavy
hitting
everyday
beer
a
good
beer
but
nothing
jumping
out
to
rate
it
any
higher
amber
color
with
a
decent
head
and
a
good
malt
flavor
taste
like
my
number
rating
the
body
was
a
step
or
two
on
the
light
side
of
medium
for
the
style
and
had
a
slightly
sweet
finish
drinkability
was
good
the
beer
was
gone
quickly
and
i
suspect
one
could
slide
several
of
these
down
in
short
order
overall
a
solid
if
unspectacular
example
of
the
style
worth
trying
if
you
see
it
oddly
estery

im
in

haul
ive
never
found
any
big
treasure
with

but
the
booty
has
been
pretty
consistent
over
the
years
i
like
this
brewery
and
the
bulk
of
their
lineup
is
at
least
respectable
and
more
often
pretty
damn
good
cutlass
i
happen
to
think
is
fantastic
there
arent
many
truer
better
examples
of
the

currently
brewed

would
definitely
get
this
again

this
is
a
solid
beer
to
drink
for

youre
in

mood
for

style
o
almost
as
good
as
eliotness
or
sam
adams

must
try
overall
i
would
love
to
support
this
local
brewery
but
beyond
loose
cannon
and
maybe
small
craft
warning
imperial
pils
most
beers
are
underwhelming
the
draft
versions
around
town
especially
what
i
have
had
at
opacy
have
all
been
much
much
better
than
the
bottled
versions
overall
this
is
a
very
very
solid
lager
great
session
beer
full
of
flavor
nicely
balanced
and
extremely
drinkable
ill
certainly
get
this
beer
again
this
is
a
decently
well
rounded
and
smooth

pleasing
type
of

some
additional

a
bit
of
wet

metallic
flavor
medium
carbonation
and
light

have
yet
to
like
any
beer
from
these
guys
o
this
is
a
pleasant
take
on
a
vienna
lager
from
heavy
seas
its
definitely
no
eliot
ness
and
its
not
exactly
a
boston
lager
but
its
still
enjoyable
oa
nice

lager
nice
if
understated
flavor
very
drinkable
brew
malt
character
is
pleasant
if
the
estery
and
metallic
notes
werent
present
this
would
score
higher
o
this
beer
is
nice
and
malty
and
tastes
like
a
true
representation
of
the
style
awesome

reminds
me
of

not

a

kind
of

a

sessionable

beer
but
flavoring
is
not
up
to
clipper

very

very
bland
kind
of
a
boring
beer
malty
flavorless

brings
toasted
and
nutty
grain
faint
kiss
of

some
earthy

follows
scent
mild
but
flavorful
perhaps
undone
by
the
body
which
just
misses
being
crisp
lighter
side
of
medium
lightly
coating
overall
a
decent
although
light
flavored
and
bodied
vienna
overall
quite
enjoyable
not
sure
why
its
labelled
an
american
amber
when
im
certain
they
told
me
it
was
a
vienna
style
lager
in
no
for
a
wedding
and
sat
and
had
a
sampler
with
dinner
this
brew
was
a
very
thin
and
light
amber
color
nearly
no
head
on
this
to
speak
of
there
was
a
mild
malt
aroma
and
faint
hops
present
the
taste
was
very
thin
and
watered
down
my
wife
really
enjoys
ambers
and
she
had
one
of
these
and
didnt
enjoy
it
for
being
in
the
sampler
i
would
not
recommend
this
brew
nice
ambercopperrust
color
with
about
a
half
inch
head
and
a
fine
bit
of
lacing
flavor
of
nice
toasted
grains
slightly
malted
with
a
nice
little
hop
punch
at
the
end
made
for
a
nicely
balanced
beer
though
a
litter
lighter
than
i
hadbeen
initially
expecting
drinkability
an
excellent
beer
to
beat
the
new
orleans
heat
decent
but
the
diacetyl
is
a
little
to
prevalent
it
does
not
ruin
the
beer
but
it
is
there
a
small
grip
and
an
overall
good
beer
to
quaff
at
the
brewpub
light
to
medium
body
with
medium
carbonation
nothing
special
but
it
seemed
like
the
best
offering
available
i
only
found
myself
in
this
setting
for
a
meeting
so
i
doubt
id
make
my
way
out
again
for
another
overall
a
decent
brew
but
nothing
to
get
excited
about

drinkable
but
not
excellent
okay
at
best
for
the
style
clear
light
amber
beer
with
a
thick
cream
coloured
head
supported
by
constant
aggressive
carbonation
chunky
lacing
with
rings
of
foam
clinging
to
the
glass
the
aroma
had
a
bit
of
chop
to
it
but
was
dominated
by
an
acidic
bite
from
the
excessive
carbonation
the
flavour
was
mild
perhaps
delicate
with
a
bit
of
fruit
malt
and
hops
staying
nicely
balanced
unfortunately
the
bitterness
became
a
bit
dirty
and
harsh
in
the
finish
light
bodied
with
too
much
carbonation
but
the
mouthfeel
did
stay
fairly
soft
fairly
easy
to
drink
but
the
carbonation
was
a
serious
problem
mouthfeel
was
darn
nice
much
more
appetizing
than
the
black
forest
drinkability
is
good
with
this
one
this
is
my
favorite
offering
from
this
tasting
at
crescent
city
the
bartender
told
me
that
it
was
their
signature
beer
i
agree
this
tastes
a
lot
like
crescent
citys
pilsener
except
this
has
a
more
lemony
finish
and
a
slight
bit
more
malt
flavor
red
stallion
pours
an
amber
color
with
a
good
head
smell
is
appropriately
hoppy
with
some
lemon
zest
mixed
in
taste
is
broadly
in
the
vienna
style
i
thought
malt
flavor
wasnt
present
enough
for
full
satisfaction
tastes
too
close
to
their
pilsener
for
a
strong
distinction
this
is
easy
and
enjoyable
enough
to
drink
i
just
wish
it
had
more
kick
the
mouthfeel
is
smooth
with
a
relatively
clean
and
quite
finish
medium
bodied
very
light
carbonation
level
the
flavor
is
slighlty
off
balanced
to
give
it
a
better
score
in
drinkability
and
i
was
getting
slightly
bored
by
the
end
of
the
drink
this
is
a
vienna
style
red
but
is
actually
more
of
a
copper
color
with
a
low
beige
head
aroma
is
malty
and
biscuity
but
not
hoppy
mouthfeel
is
average
moderately
carbed
flavor
is
medium
malt
a
little
doughey
with
bits
of
caramel
and
diacetyl
a
lingering
hop
bite
can
be
felt
in
the
back
of
the
throat
this
one
is
average
to
above
average
in
all
respects
stick
with
the
ipa
if
they
have
it
or
the
black
forest
it
isnt
quite
red
as
the
name
might
make
you
think
it
was
more
of
a
dark
golden
color
with
maybe
a
tinge
of
red
to
it
it
had
a
big
strong
head
that
had
good
lacing
the
nose
was
somewhat
weak
with
no
hops
there
at
all
some
sweetness
to
the
nose
the
taste
was
a
bit
sweet
not
bad
but
not
real
exciting
either
mouthfeel
is
on
the
thin
side
drink
ability
is
fairly
decent
as
the
carbonation
seems
perfectly
calibrated
overall
a
pleasant
beer
not
outstanding
but
not
bad
at
all
i
would
recommend
giving
this
one
a
try
would
probably
pair
very
well
with
cheddar
cheese
and
some
crackers
overall
a
solid
example
of
the
style
tasty
and
very
drinkable
although
not
very
exciting
worth
a
try
o
this
is
a
very
decent
beer
although
i
dont
find
it
to
match
up
to
the
style
listed
here
it
is
well
balanced
between
sweet
and
bitter
and
it
is
more
suited
to
be
an
apa
in
my
opinion
i
like
it
and
think
it
would
go
better
with
a
steak
dinner
rather
than
on
its
own
i
would
get
this
again
if
given
the
chance
and
recommend
it
to
fellow
bas
overall
not
overly
spicy
as
the
style
would
indicate
hoppy
for
a
brown
hops
a
bit
unbalanced
and
simple
cracked
open
a
bottle
to
wash
down
some
korean
takeout
it
poured
a
clear
brown
with
a
short
white
head
the
aroma
is
a
mix
of
toasty
malt
and
honey
the
flavor
has
a
slightly
nutty
character
with
the
caramel
malts
but
it
also
tastes
like
a
theres
a
little
adjunct
corn
i
think
mixed
in
overall
this
kind
of
tastes
like
a
slightly
darker
yuengling
lager
saranac
makes
better
beer
id
stick
to
with
the
black
forest
its
best
to
let
it
breath
well
before
you
drink
it
it
had
a
wonderful
spice
note
complemented
the
powerful
nut
flavor
only
down
side
is
the
spice
sat
pretty
heavy
in
my
mouth
after
i
drank
overall
a
pretty
good
beer
this
beer
qualifies
as
all
that
so
i
probably
scored
it
a
bit
higher
unlike
matts
white
ipa
i
prefer
to
reward
effort
too
saranac
makes
dependably
solid
beer
for
the
prices
they
charge
and
seasons
best
is
no
exception
poors
a
nice
amber
color
nutty
and
toasty
smell
with
a
hint
of
caramel
it
tastes
as
it
smells
which
is
of
light
caramel
and
toasted
nuts
it
also
has
a
slight
hoppiness
to
it
definitely
drinkable
with
a
smooth
and
thin
feel
overall
a
quality
brew
not
what
youd
typically
expect
for
a
winter
seasonal
and
not
a
style
you
see
all
the
time
pours
a
shade
lighter
than
their
pale
ale
with
am
prominent
white
head
smells
nutty
a
little
but
nothing
remarkable
in
the
nose
taste
is
very
average
not
much
different
from
many
other
lagers
perhaps
a
touch
more
richness
and
a
curious
malt
finish
but
not
what
i
have
come
to
expect
from
saranac
i
must
say
they
make
much
better
winter
seasonals
do
not
waste
your
time
with
the
seasons
best
better
than
average
for
saranac
but
im
pretty
harsh
to
these
guys
but
only
based
on
the
quality
of
the
beers
this
beer
pours
a
bold
copper
color
with
a
half
inch
of
tan
foam
and
lacing
that
lasts
to
the
end
its
aroma
is
of
nuts
caramel
and
roasted
malt
the
flavor
is
nutty
with
caramel
and
vanilla
notes
there
is
a
very
good
balance
between
the
malt
sweetness
and
hoppy
bitterness
that
shows
in
the
finish
the
hops
fade
as
it
warms
and
the
malt
again
shows
through
very
complex
it
has
a
medium
mouthfeel
and
a
slightly
dry
finish
saranac
seasons
best
nut
brown
lager
is
an
outstanding
beer
very
drinkable
highly
recommended
poured
a
clear
chestnut
brown
with
a
finger
of
frothy
white
head
that
retains
well
light
aroma
but
toasted
malts
noticeable
nutty
with
a
bit
of
hops
for
balance
toasted
bread
in
the
taste
nutty
light
caramel
finishes
off
with
a
light
hop
bite
and
a
decent
dry
finish
lightmedium
mouthfeel
and
somewhat
drinkable
but
not
too
distinctive
rather
unpleasant
cardboard
aftertaste
with
a
growing
bitterness
i
cant
point
to
big
faults
but
it
is
not
a
favorite
overall
for
the
style
it
was
pretty
dead
on
which
lead
it
to
be
very
quaffable
clear
brown
with
some
amber
highlights
stiff
head
of
ivory
which
laced
the
glass
pretty
well
smells
caramely
and
malty
lightly
hopped
with
some
nice
chocolatey
malt
didnt
get
nut
until
it
warmed
a
bit
not
too
sweet
not
too
dry
mouthfeel
is
thin
but
not
watered
down
kinda
thin
goes
quite
well
with
a
nice
hot
bowl
of
ministrone
i
look
forward
to
this
every
year
pours
a
onefinger
light
khaki
head
that
fades
quickly
leaving
a
good
lace
nice
clear
amber
color
good
carbonation

a
very
attractive
and
pleasant
seasonal
even
a
bit
understated
robust
malts
with
pretty
firm
bitterness
to
match

roasty

for
the

spot
on
for
the

well
done

2010
pours
a
clear
dark
reddish
brown
with
two
fingers
of
creamy
beige
head
and
sheeting
lace
that
diminishes
with
time
the
nose
is
of
sweet
nutty
and
caramel
malt
notes
with
a
pleasant
supporting
notes
of
floral
and
herbal
hops
lightbodied
with
soft
carbonation
and
a
tight
light
yet
significantly
bitter
finish
the
palate
turns
a
touch
astringent
and
drying
at
the
finish
not
among
my
favorites
opinion
this
is
an
ok
beer
i
am
sure
that
it
would
be
better
without
the
oxidation
so
i
will
hold
out
and
say
that
i
wouldnt
mind
trying
this
beer
again
it
could
use
more
carbonation
as
well
but
i
will
guess
that
the
cap
leaked
a
bit
in
all
of
its
age
even
though
it
is
showing
its
age
it
isnt
so
far
off
that
it
isnt
drinkable
and
i
will
finish
my
glass
d
goes
down
nice
and
smooth
and
with
the
low
abv
its
something
you
can
drink
and
relax
pretty
good
brew
dvery
drinkable
for
a
vienna
lager
well
balanced
and
the
sweetness
make
it
a
great
winter
beer
d
very
nice
very
drinkable
would
be
great
on
tap
or
insession
probably
great
with
anything
smoked
or
any
roasted
red
meat
d
pretty
drinkable
nothing
to
blow
you
away
here
but
the
taste
is
fairly
balanced
and
smooth
overall
the
beer
is
very
smooth
and
fairly
refreshing
d
after
1
5
of
these
it
just
kind
of
got
alcoholy
to
me
and
wasnt
pleasant
d
very
high
i
will
pick
up
a
few
more
6pks
of
this
stuff
for
the
price
its
very
nice
a
good
beer
to
sit
with
for
a
while
aroma
is
all
malty
with
some
toffee
caramel
baked
bread
and
roasted
nut
notes
the
tastes
are
very
similar
to
the
aroma
with
the
malts
dominating
there
is
a
pleasant
earthy
hop
and
nutty
malt
finish
mouthfeel
was
a
little
on
the
thin
side
but
is
is
a
lager
so
i
could
drink
a
number
of
these
a
good
cold
weather
session
ale
to
have
at
a
party
so
as
to
not
get
too
sloppy
one
of
the
better
saranac
offerings
i
have
had
recently
d
seasons
best
is
a
pretty
good
brew
good
flavor
as
always
from
the
matt
family
pours
a
nice
clear
amber
with
a
nice
offwhite
head
aroma
of
toasted
caramel
malts
some
light
fruituness
tastes

toasted

with
good
carbonation
finish
toasted

malt
with

overall
an
average
and

d
like
always
saranac
manages
to
make
another
mediocre
brew
thats
drinkable
but
not
particularly
enjoyable
all
in
all
this
is
a
decent
brew
nothing
spectacular
but
a
nice
drinkable
beer
a
nutty
spiced
brown
ale
of
a
seasonalwinter
beer
nothing
particularly
special
but
good
nonetheless
has
an
aroma
of
a
typical
nut
brown
ale
and
its
good
very
drinkable
good
body
admiral
taste
good
smell
overall
pretty
solid
not
groundbreaking
but
not
everything
has
to
be
nice
stuff
overall
drinkability
and
mouthfeel
crisp
with
a
tight
carbonation
it
goes
down
a
little
too
easy
for
a
winter
beer
but
overall
its
a
quality
beer
for
the
category
pours
a
dark
brown
color
with
a
nice
ruby
tint
in
the
back
for
a
glare
effect
fast
dissipating
head
and
some
lacing
noticed
on
the
tumbler
glass
the
smells
are
slight
theyre
of
the
roasted
malt
kind
and
seems
to
be
this
brews
only
below
average
account
taste
is
tolerable
little
slippery
for
a
nut
brown
but
the
flavor
is
right
on
with
the
aspects
of
the
style
hops
play
well
too
moderately
carbonated
which
is
very
nice
abv
nonexistent
in
the
wash
down
little
thin
in
texture
sums
it
up
nicely
drinkability
sure
why
not
cheap
local
and
overall
a
good
seasonal
as
rated
above
it
did
the
trick
for
me
this
year
and
i
may
just
have
to
go
back
again
next
year
until
then
a
solid
offering
from
saranac
d
a
litte
overwhelming
at
first
with
a
thicker
bodied
feel
not
easy
to
session
with
nor
should
it
be
attempted
with
the
higher
abv
overall
i
enjoyed
it
but
failed
in
comparison
to
the
two
other
browns
i
had
yesterday
sam
smiths
and
goose
island
however
i
think
its
a
good
starting
point
for
someone
whose
never
had
a
nut
brown
a
nice
tasty
slightly
chewy
dark
lager
pours
a
light
brown
color
with
a
small
head
the
head
evaporates
quickly
the
taste
is
malty
with
some
flavors
of
coffee
the
smell
is
of
roasted
malts
and
it
has
a
very
good
odor
that
is
a
good
representation
of
the
taste
of
the
beer
a
good
nut
brown
not
very
complex
but
solid
d
a
nice
combination
of
mouthfeel
and
taste
made
this
beer
pretty
drinkable
the
nut
brown
lager
was
an
intriguing
and
pretty
good
beer
overall
bravo
and
uh
happy
holidays
in
late
june
ha
ha
ho
ho
points
for
drinkability
as
this
one
is
mostly
pleasant
and
sparklingly
clean
though
the
finish
is
a
bit
cloying
an
interesting
winter
seasonal
with
that
clean
lager
quality
that
helps
it
fit
in
even
in
the
hot
georgia
summer
medium
body
nice
carbonation
pretty
smooth
dry
finish
easy
drinker
i
had
this
beer
at
a
little
irish
pubbeer
bar
type
of
place
in
swansboro
north
carolina
the
beer
had
a
cloudy
appearance
and
was
a
creamy
brown
color
the
nut
was
apparent
in
the
nose
but
not
so
much
in
the
flavor
the
beer
struck
a
nice
balance
between
the
hops
and
the
malt
it
was
very
pleasant
and
easy
to
drink
just
about
perfect
for
something
to
pass
the
time
not
a
bad
beer
at
all
but
not
my
favorite
of
the
saranac
offerings
amber
colored
beer
with
a
rapidly
fading
head
aroma
is
nutty
taste
is
caramelnuts
and
bread
i
would
classify
this
more
as
a
brown
ale
good
rich
flavor
and
taste
i
think
this
is
something
that
should
be
tried
at
least
onceand
something
i
would
surely
buy
again
picked
up
a
couple
six
packs
at
greens
in
columbia
sc
i
know
one
of
the
employees
there
and
he
informed
me
that
they
were
getting
ready
to
mark
them
down
to
3
99six
so
i
got
the
insiders
deal
the
beer
pours
a
rich
reddish
mahogany
color
with
a
light
tan
head
decent
head
retention
and
some
lacing
the
aroma
is
mostly
from
the
malts
with
toffee
caramel
baked
bread
and
roasted
nut
notes
with
some
piney
hops
in
the
background
taste
is
very
similar
to
the
aroma
with
the
malts
dominating
there
is
a
pleasant
slighty
bitter
hoppy
and
nutty
finish
mouthfeel
was
a
little
on
the
thin
side
but
i
could
drink
a
number
of
these
one
of
the
better
saranac
offerings
in
my
opinion
a
pretty
good
brew
a
nice
addition
to
to
the
winter
brew
pack
definitely
a
beer
to
drink
with
snow
on
the
ground
pours
a
mostly
transparent
and
light
bending
amber
brown
color
with
a
small
sticky
off
white
head
sweet
nutty
and
slightly
smokey
malts
in
the
nose
brown
sugar
caramel
chocolate
and
a
roasty
nuttiness
good
flavor
lightmedium
body
good
carbonation
nothing
id
rave
about
but
definitely
one
of
the
better
offerings
ive
had
recently
from
saranac
poured
from
12
oz
bottle
into
pint
glass
pours
a
very
clear
dark
amber
brown
color
looks
almost
ruby
reddish
brown
when
held
up
to
the
light
has
a
small
caramel
colored
head
that
faded
immediately
to
a
ring
of
foam
around
the
glass
minimal
lacing
hardly
any
noticeable
aromas
in
the
smell
just
a
little
bit
of
nutty
malts
nothing
going
on
in
the
taste
either
slightly
metalic
tasting
some
nuttiness
and
a
little
on
the
watery
side
rather
light
body
to
this
one
and
a
little
to
much
carbonation
almost
reminds
me
of
a
newcastle
brown
ale
only
i
would
prefer
newcastle
over
this
there
really
nothing
going
on
in
this
at
all
its
got
a
little
bit
of
a
nutty
taste
to
it
and
then
thats
it
definately
would
not
seek
this
out
again
and
i
recommend
everyone
do
the
same
saranac
has
yet
to
show
me
a
really
great
beer
d
a
little
tasty
goes
down
ok
not
too
filling
mild
kick
exactly
what
you
expect
out
of
style
its
not
a
bad
beer
but
there
really
isnt
too
much
about
this
beer
that
would
make
it
stand
out
enough
that
id
want
to
drink
it
again
d
this
is
pretty
nice
it
certainly
looks
great
not
especially
complex
but
its
got
a
strong
flavor
and
its
definitely
not
one
of
the
cloying
cinnamon
and
nutmeg
infused
winter
seasonals
from
many
breweries
d
this
would
be
a
great
dark
lager
if
it
werent
for
the
ammonia
smell
that
seems
to
develop
as
the
beer
warms
i
didnt
notice
it
the
first
time
i
drank
the
beer
but
then
again
it
was
cold
and
i
had
a
few
beers
before
it
unfortunately
the
smell
ruins
a
otherwise
decent
beer
for
me
and
reminds
me
off
my
high
school
chemistry
days
of
synthesizing
nitrogen
triiodide
out
of
a
standard
brown
bottle
this
brew
was
a
woodstain
brown
color
with
some
mahogany
highlights
the
head
was
two
fingers
thick
tan
and
left
streaks
of
lacing
off
the
skim
the
aroma
was
mostly
of
roasted
malt
and
caramel
malt
with
little
hop
profile
the
flavors
were
at
first
semisweet
starting
on
the
caramel
malt
note
it
then
became
more
nutty
before
heading
to
a
dry
bitter
finish
it
was
not
unlike
an
e
s
b
in
a
lot
of
ways
complete
with
hints
of
sourness
the
body
was
medium
the
mouthfeel
watery
and
the
carbonation
moderate
pours
a
nice
semideep
brown
with
a
bit
of
head
and
a
tiny
bit
of
lacing
nice
deep
and
malty
scent
hints
of
nuts
but
mostly
malt
good
deep
taste
nice
malty
brown
ale
ent
draught
with
a
perceptible
nutty
flavor
goes
down
very
well
an
excellent
beer
much
like
a
standard
nut
brown
ale
but
evidently
with
a
lager
yeast
making
it
nice
and
smooth
not
a
bad
brew
a
bit
husky
and
nothing
particularly
noteworthy
but
a
decent
lager
with
a
nice
nut
brown
character
no
ifs
ands
or
buts
i
thought
this
one
was
a
nice
brew
drinkable
seasonal
beer
and
very
good
for
style
it
is
a
pretty
complex
taste
it
tastes
like
the
malts
were
well
roasted
i
dont
think
that
i
would
grab
a
6
of
these
no
i
wouldnt
definitely
not
the
seasons
best
beer
that
i
drank
but
not
bad
kind
of
a
session
beer
of
the
beers
that
came
in
the
12
beers
of
winter
sample
pack
this
one
is
by
far
my
favorite
mouthfeeldrinkability
thankfully
better
with
regard
to
texture
than
the
last
few
saranac
offerings
mildly
prickly
in
the
mouth
never
going
over
the
top
and
not
going
flat
either
drinkable
no
doubt
just
unmemorable
and
a
bit
flabby
longneck
poured
into
a
large
ayinger
glass
very
deep
amber
to
light
red
color
with
a
heaping
of
offwhite
head
very
clear
with
just
a
bit
of
carbonation
rising
aroma
of
toffee
chocolate
chip
cookie
dough
and
caramel
flavors
include
dark
toast
caramel
hint
of
chocolate
toasted
nuts
and
a
bit
of
a
spicy
bitterness
in
the
finish
to
balance
everything
out
feel
of
the
beer
is
medium
and
the
carbonation
is
not
overdone
drinkability
is
good
on
this
lager
though
it
is
geared
toward
the
malty
side
there
is
some
dry
bitterness
that
comes
in
and
keeps
it
in
check
a
pretty
solid
beer
year
to
year
from
saranac
and
a
winner
in
the
winter

after
retrying
this
beer
it
reminds
me
of
sa
boston
lager
a
little
less
aggresively
hopped
perhaps
and
since
i
aint
no
hophead
thats
not
a
problem
and
this
stuff
is
starting
to
grow
on
me
i
just
might
run

it
has

which
works
well
with
this

drinkability
is
good
its
smooth
and
goes
down
easy
and
would
be
a
decent
choice
as
an
occasional
session
beer
overall
i
think
this
is
a
good
beer
i
enjoyed
it
well
it
was
certainly
refreshing
for
the
little
amount
of
time
it
occupied
my
glass
this
is
a
really
decent
lager
but
seasons
best
its
not
there
are
quite
a
bit
of
other
selections
around
the
winter
months
that
are
more
intriguing
drinkability
good
this
is
best
of
the

i
do
enjoy
this
one
but
it
just
seems
to
miss
something
from
hihg
end
lager
not
just
seasons
best
but
saranacs
best
i
usually
find
them
to
be
just
an
average
brewery
but
this
stuff
is
nice
3
25
the
taste
is
ok
and
very
mild
maybe
i
was
expecting
something
different
so
that
might
be
what
made
me
not
like
it
that
much
pours
a
clear
amber
brown
color
with
a
tight
cream
colored
head
that
left
some
nice
lacing
on
the
glass
as
it
settled
as
with
most
saranac
offerings
i
have
a
hard
time
picking
much
up
on
the
nose
there
seems
to
be
a
light
caramelbuttery
malt
with
a
subtle
spicy
hop
kick
the
taste
is
sweet
from
the
caramel
malt
there
is
also
a
spicy
sweetness
to
it
as
well
the
sweetness
is
balanced
by
a
spicy
tea
like
hop
the
brew
has
a
moderate
body
with
plenty
of
carbonation
that
leads
to
a
crispness
finishes
bitter
and
astringent
a
servicable
lager
fairly
crisp
and
some
nice
flavors
d
very
drinkable
im
looking
forward
to
having
the
other
one
i
have
notes
overall
this
is
a
solid
ale
and
works
well
as
one
of
saranacs
winter
seasonal
beers
i
fine
beer
by
my
account
interesting
and
drinkable
im
glad
to
get
the
chance
to
try
it
drinkability
considering
the
saranac
winter
pack
was
good
this
one
needs
work
a
mediocre
beer
that
needs
a
facelift
in
the
indentity
department
my
real
beef
is
the
seasons
best
nomenclature
name
on
the
label
i
expected
something
special
for
the
holidays
from
saranac
maybe
a
little
spice
a
little
fruit
something
more
than
a
run
of
the
mill
nut
brown
for
the
season
better
to
go
with
their
black
forest
better
yet
a
brooklyn
chocolate
stout
drinkability
far
from
complex
though
its
fairly
tasty
and
quite
drinkable
deserving
of
a
sturdy
pat
on
the
back
d
not
great
not
bad
somewhere
in
the
middle
really
just
like
most
saranac
not
bad
to
drink
may
search
out
some
other
vienna
lagers
to
better
feel
the
style
this
brew
poured
a
medium
brown
color
with
a
fair
sized
head
that
broke
down
somewhat
quickly
but
did
leave
some
lace
down
the
side
brew
has
a
nice
roasted
malty
nutty
and
caramel
scents
the
flavors
are
quite
nice
as
well
roasted
malts
give
a
sweet
taste
with
a
hop
flavor
that
is
noticeable
then
breaks
quite
quickly
some
coffee
and
chocolate
flavors
are
mixed
in
and
seem
to
make
an
appearance
and
then
quickly
disappear
good
carbonation
while
this
brew
does
not
have
any
real
outstanding
aspects
it
is
very
easy
drinking
and
a
nice
addition
to
the
christmas
12
pack
a
nice
easy
to
drink
if
not
average
beer
pour
was
decent
strong
deep
amber
with
red
hues
no
bubbles
and
no
head
aroma
was
weak
could
pick
up
a
hint
of
caramel
malt
but
very
faint
taste
was
very
malty
with
strong
carbonation
that
pricks
your
tongue
very
easy
to
drink
but
kind
of
bland
drinkability
here
is
good
not
the
best
vienna
but
a
darn
good
one
mfd
medium
bodied
with
a
creamy
mouthfeel
not
a
bad
offering
and
a
nice
addition
to
the
saranac
winter
sampler
nut
brown
lager
wtf
ok
i
guess
im
excited
sounds
pretty
tasty
and
unusual
just
noticed
the
nice
artwork
on
the
label
which
i
dont
think
ive
been
appreciating
when
it
comes
to
the
rest
of
saranacs
beers
pours
a
nice
amber
brown
maybe
a
little
too
similar
to
their
esb
if
theyre
trying
to
differentiate
the
two
based
on
color
but
good
head
and
good
lacing
aroma
is
great
very
perfumey
and
piney
but
its
either
how
it
mixes
with
the
rest
of
the
malt
or
something
else
that
makes
it
unique
taste
is
a
huge
kick
in
the
malt
bone
if
there
was
one
astringency
is
very
noticeable
though
which
seems
to
be
a
problem
for
saranacs
beers
the
complex
roasted
malt
flavors
retain
their
integrity
in
the
face
of
the
lagering
process
which
was
what
i
was
worried
about
i
was
worried
it
was
going
to
be
like
the
indian
brown
ale
and
taste
nothing
like
a
brown
anything
but
it
definitely
pulls
through
unfortunately
the
astringency
is
a
huge
flaw
and
affects
my
score
significantly
mouthfeel
benefits
form
the
overall
malt
character
medium
to
full
body
and
really
pleasant
to
drink
probably
a
tie
with
the
esb
for
my
favorite
in
the
mix
pack
just
fix
that
astringency
apply
it
to
the
other
beers
in
the
pack
and
id
be
really
happy
a
nice
solid
beer
here
pours
a
mahogany
color
and
taste
wise
is
akin
to
a
sa
boston
lager
has
a
touch
of
a
brown
ale
to
it
but
is
a
little
hoppier
than
the
usual
brown
ale
smells
and
looks
great
taste
and
mouthfeel
can
be
improved
for
sure
but
i
definitely
enjoyed
the
2
bottles
in
this
12
pack
lightbodied
a
bit
ashy
feels
like
an
amberred
a
solid
beer
bitter
in
the
amberish
malt
sweet
in
the
caramel
malts
a
good
offering
d
overall
this
is
a
fairly
bland
beer
but
not
too
hard
to
drink
i
dont
care
for
the
funky
rotten
flavor
but
thankfully
it
doesnt
overwhelm
the
other
stuff
going
on
not
terrible
but
probably
not
something
ill
remember
not
this
seasons
best
but
good
this
beer
poured
a
dark
brown
with
twofinger
yellowing
beige
head
the
smell
is
mostly
of
malt
with
a
little
bit
of
hops
and
nuttiness
the
taste
starts
off
with
some
sweet
caramel
maltiness
that
is
intermingled
with
some
slightly
piney
hops
the
mouthfeel
is
thin
and
slightly
oily
with
a
decent
amount
of
carbonation
not
a
difficult
beer
to
drink
but
i
think
it
might
sit
a
little
heavy
d
this
beer
intrigues
me
it
may
take
a
few
to
figure
out
and
i
have
no
problem
with
that
mouthfeel
is
decent
semi
dry
finish
on
a
medium
bodied
brew
the
bottle
calls
it
a
nut
brown
the
site
calls
it
a
vienna
its
more
of
a
brown
ale
and
a
pretty
decent
one
at
that
would
reccommend
to
anyone
who
would
like
a
hoppy
brown
ale
d
a
tasty
straightforward
lager
with
a
nutty
malty
twist
a
nice
effort
from
saranac
quite
drinkable
for
what
it
is
not
a
bad
beer
at
all
smooth
and
creamy
in
the
mouth
surprisingly
fullishmedium
in
body
the
beer
is
pleasant
and
very
drinkable
saranac
calls
this
their
seasons
best
nut
brown
lager
brown
colored
topped
with
a
thick
tan
head
the
aroma
was
pretty
boring
but
theres
a
nice
malt
flavor
in
there
with
a
hoppy
spicy
bite
maybe
a
little
sour
relatively
warming
and
a
nice
one
for
the
holidays
the
correct
style
is
vienna
style
lager
i
got
this
one
on
sale
at
my
local
supermarket
pours
a
clear
med
orangebrown
w
a
fluffy
tan
head
which
dissipates
quickly
leaving
a
decent
amount
of
lacing
in
my
nonic
a
strong
grainy
smell
full
of
toasty
aromatics
some
spicy
hop
aroma
as
well
a
rich
nuttytoastlike
flavor
w
a
good
bite
possibly
from
the
darker
malts
but
there
are
some
hops
present
also
some
darker
fruitlike
undertones
faintly
metallic
as
well
a
dry

bodied
brew
w
a
decent

letting
it

a
very
good

beer
a
decent

for

kind
of
high
in
the
middle
and
droopy
on
the
ends
not
bad
not
great
after
having
this
last
winter
and
loving
it
i
bought
a
six
pack
of
this
years
brew
the
06
was
definitely
takes
the
cake
compared
to
the
07
unless
memory
is
playing
tricks
on
me

in

theres
something
appropriately
festive
about
this
beer
i
think
it
might
be
the

lightly
oily
this
is
actually
a
nice
lager
from
saranac
d
very
good
lightbodied
and
decent
flavor
for
a
wintertype
lager
that
lingering
sweetness
may
keep
me
from
wanting
to
have
more
than
a
couple
but
it
didnt
slow
me
down
with
one
bottle
the
glass
was
empty
in
less
than
20
minutes
one
of
the
better
saranac
brews
but
it
doesnt
have
quite
as
much
depth
as
id
like
even
as
a
lager
highly
carbonated
as
it
should
be
a
very
drinkable
and
tasty
lager
for
the
right
mood
not
a
bad
brew
but
not
terribly
interesting
or
exemplary
still
its
tasty
and
would
make
for
a
very
sessionable
bbeer
another
pretty
solid
but
unspectacular
matt
brew
d
overall
not
a
very
satisfying
beer
seems
like
it
could
do
better
in
the
dark
lager
category
but
falls
short
i
feel
that
its
simply
more
suited
for
an
ale
and
that
a
dark
lager
of
this
vein
could
be
made
patience
is
a
virtue
my
impression
of
saranac
seasons
best
changed
over
the
course
of
the
bottle
again
with
warming
from
eh
to
hey
this
is
pretty
good
beer
this
is
one
of
the
better
saranac
offerings
that
ive
had
but
it
still
isnt
worthy
of
the
anniversary
appellation
a
nice
nutty
lager
with
some
porter
characteristics
lightly
roasted
coffee
in
the
nose
and
strong
on
the
palate
also
some
honey
notes
hops
are
hidden
though
the
hint
of
bitterness
proves
theyre
there
just
not
much
aroma
goes
down
clean
but
not
very
smooth
a
great
session
beer
in
my
opinion
beef
notes
i
picked
this
up
mainly
because
of
the
seasonal
closeout
pricetag
and
while
its
not
bad
im
glad
i
didnt
pay
much
more
for
it
grab
it

you
see
it

is
a

is
very
sharp

you
off

about

it

detect
much
else
the
mouthfeel
is
also

wont

this
beer

there
is
much
better
offerings
from

this
beer
made
my
taste
buds
angry
this
beer
suprised
me
my
first
of
this
style
and
i
had
low
expectations
but
i
enjoyed
this
one
and
will
look
for
more
next
holidays
not
at
all
what
i
anticipated
but
still
very
nice
well
balanced
and
pleasing
i
can
see
three
or
four
of
these
at
the
ski
lodge
in
january
oh
yeah

to
say
beer
somewhat
malty

and
iron
like
finishes
on
the
sweet
side
and
fairly
clean
being
as
this
is
a
lager
vs
an
ale
no
real
nutty
or
slight
chocolate
flavor
that
im
used
to
in
a
nut
brown
average
body
overall
a
very
average
beer
ok
in
a
variety
pack
but
otherwise
i
think
i
would
skip
it
the
apperance
was
a
dark
carmel
color
not
much
of
a
head
the
smell
was
rich
and
nutty
the
taste
was
average
but
one
thing
that
i
did
notice
is
that
the
beer
got
better
with
time
my
first
impression
was
overtaken
by
the
initial
over
carbonation
after
it
was
in
the
glass
a
little
while
and
warmed
up
the
taste
was
better
and
the
mouthfeel
improved
overall
i
would
say
the
nut
brown
lager
was
slightly
above
average
picked
this
one
up
as
part
of
the
12
beers
of
winter
i
must
say
that
this
is
a
really
good
offering
from
utica
ny
while
it
doesnt
exhibit
the
strong
nut
like
nose
or
flavor
of
say
a
sam
smiths
it
is
a
good
quality
brew
which
seems
to
be
a
good
session
brew
i
will
have
to
seek
this
out
on
draught
next
time
i
go
thru
utica
on
the
way
to
buffalo

a
nice

with

for

by
nice

the
flavor

smooth
things
out

thin

a
flimsy

lots
of

that
wont

and
runs
down
into
the
glass
aroma
is
very
mild
really
just
only
slightly
of

earthy
bready
malts
nothing
really
jumps
out

me
in
the

are

right

some

clean
and

the
quality
of
this
one
really
blindsided
me
i

i
wasnt

was

clear
besides
that
with

characterized

by
a
sweet

smell
with
some
nutty
nuances
intermingled
with
the
malt
who
would
have
guessed
that
in
the
background
there
is
a
typical
lager

well
most
likely
from
a
lagerlike

is
light

not

nothing

really
just
nothing
really
there
basically
like
drinking
a
lager
with
a
touch
of
nutty
malt
flavors
there
is
a
strange
finish
to
this
which
i
picked
up
in
their
chocolate
amber
lager
as
well
that
is
hard
to
put
words
to
i
think
it
comes
from
the
lager
background
to
this
beer
yeast
maybe
which
im
not
totally
accustomed
to
mouthfeel
is
bordering
thin
to
medium
drinkability
is
decent
although
the
strange
finish
which
this
one
has
would
deter
me
from
wanting
too
many
i
almost
though
this
was
going
to
be
a
spiced
beer
because
of
the
seasonal
designation
from
a
brewery
that
oftentimes
overuses
flavorings
it
was
nice
to
see
that
it
wasnt
this
dark
lager
is
something
like
a
brown
ale
except
that
its
a
lager
it
has
a
deep
mahoganybrown
body
with
a
foamy
head
of
yellowishoff
white
that
has
poor
retention
it
smells
of
toasted
almonds
very
nutty
and
very
toasted
the
taste
is
much
the
same
its
less
sweet
and
seems
to
have
less
malt
than
most
brown
ales
but
it
retains
that
rich
nutty
flavor
there
is
a
strong
toasted
flavor
mouthfeel
is
a
bit
thin
but
not
bad
for
a
lager
i
could
drink
more
than
one
of
these
but
im
not
willing
to
say
i
reccommend
this
beer
another
average
saranac
this
is
a
decent
holidaystyle
offering
from
saranac
but
probably
seems
not
have
the
makings
of
a
flagship
brew
its
nice
to
have
it
around
once
a
year
not
a
bad
winter
seasonal
but
there
are
much
better
options
out
there
average
beer
give
me
a
rogue
hazelnut
over
this
anyday
this
is
the
blandest
and
weakest
of
the
beers
that
i
have
tried
from
saranac
i
prefer
a
nut
brown
ale
anyday
brew
poured
about
three
shades
of
brown
away
from
amber
rather
light
in
color
very
little
head
and
even
that
vanished
quickly
slightly
acidic
smell
with
a
promise
of
hops
on
the
nose
taste
was
a
bit
quirky
a
tart
flavor
was
present
that
was
not
well
balanced
by
either
hop
or
malt
the
former
was
almost
abscent
the
latter
was
there
but
very
subduded
plenty
of
excitment
and
action
on
the
tastebuds
though
the
tart
flavor
carried
the
day
a
fairly
easy
brew
to
drink
but
not
really
my
cup
of
brew
the
fifth
beer
of
christmas
a
very
bland
and
flavorless
beer
imo
thank
god
theres
only
one
of
these
in
the
mixed
12
pack
i
bought
not
something
ill
be
going
back
to
copper
colored
chestnut
body
with
a
sweet
nutty
malty
aroma
flavor
is
certainly
not
complex
but
it
has
a
good
flavor
profile
and
is
nonetheless
enjoyable
nutty
sweetness
balances
a
crisp
malt
backbone
with
just
the
slightest
twang
of
hop
bitterness
finishes
smooth
and
sweet
a
caramel
nutty
sweetness
that
thankfully
isnt
too
overpowering
a
holiday
seasonal
id
drink
again
bender
factor
as
always
a
exc
brew
for
the
masses
to
put
down
satisfies
its
requirement
3
0s
for
bas
and
5
0s
for
blue
drinkers
buy
your
inlaws
a
holiday
12er
or
a
sixer
of
seasons
best
they
will
actually
like
you
for
a
change
i
initially
thought
this
would
be
a
spiced
beer
i
am
glad
it
was
not
it
didnt
need
it
it
was
very
good
smell
sof
floral
hopsstill
nothing
yet
to
remind
me
of
a
nut
brown
my
personal
favorite
style
nice
winter
warmer
that
reminds
be
of
averys
brewery
but
again
not
of
a
nut
brown
a
bit
too
hoppy
for
me
and
my
palate
expectations
while
my
leastfavorite
of
all
styles
this
is
decent
as
far
as
a
nut
brown
ale
ahem
lager
goes
it
has
the
traditional
characteristics
and
like
i
said
the
yeast
that
normally
pollutes
their
other
beers
with
diacetyl
is
appropriate
here
i
wouldnt
want
to
drink
this
again
but
i
would
recommened
it
to
people
who
like
nutbrowns
but
then
again
who
really
does
matts
seasonal
lager
displays
a
clear
chestnut
body
with
a
reddish
cast
and
goldenorange
highlights
beneath
a
short
but
longlasting
head
of
creamy
ivory
froth
some
minor
lacing
about
the
glass
adds
nicely
to
its
appearance
as
well
the
nose
is
typically
restrained
for
a
dark
lager
with
only
some
mild
malt
coming
through
the
body
is
medium
and
its
finebubbled
carbonation
bristles
gently
on
the
tongue
the
flavor
is
wellbalanced
and
straightforward
throughout
with
a
bit
of
rich
caramelkissed
maltiness
backed
by
a
solid
bitterness
and
some
delicately
spicy
and
floral
hops
it
finishes
dry
with
some
of
its
nutty
maltiness
and
floralspicy
hops
lingering
amidst
a
dull
bitterness
its
not
complex
but
it
satisfies
and
this
is
a
wellcrafted
holiday
seasonal
that
doesnt
need
to
depend
on
any
fruits
spices
or
gimmicks
to
warrant
attention
and
a
place
on
your
holiday
table
well
done
severely
hoppy
on
the
palate
leaving
a
bitter
caustic
finish
might
be
enjoyable
to
hopheads
but
not
to
me
drinkability
a
decent
beer
that
the
masses
would
find
palatable
im
wondering
if
this
is
available
outside
the
sampler
pack
ill
have
to
keep
my
eyes
open
this
fall
pours
out
a
light
brownreddish
color
with
a
slight
head
lots
of
carbonation
with
a
very
nutty
smell
to
it
not
a
bad
taste
but
too
much
carbonation
leaves
your
mouth
feeling
a
bit
dry
afterwards
i
am
a
fan
of
nut
brown
flavor
beers
but
this
is
not
my
favorite
it
has
a
crytal
clear
copper
color
it
leaves
decent
lace
on
the
glass
even
though
i
was
not
impressed
with
the
head
it
has
a
toasted
nut
aroma
with
some
hop
character
that
comes
off
as
grassyhay
like
it
is
medium
bodied
with
toatsed
nut
flavors
and
a
dry
bitter
finish
my
major
quibble
is
that
saranacs
best
beers
are
not
year
round
a
very
good
beer
that
is
much
more
hoppy
than
most
dunkels
i
lean
toward
hops
if
i
was
grading
against
style
id
probably
dock
this
one
but
with
my
preferences
i
like
this
more
than
the
usually
dark
lagers
because
it
is
so
much
more
flavorful
to
me
pours

dark
deep

respectably
solid

cant
say
that
it
impressed
me
thin

there
is
a
hefty

definitely
a
nutty
brew
this
is
my
first
nut
brown
lager
the
mouthfeel
is
very
dry
the
taste
is
strong
with
alcohol
the
hops
dont
stick
out
too
much
seems
like
there
is
a
ton
of
malt
drinkability
is
good
and
it
seems
like
a
good
session
ale
not
sure
about
the
abv
a
good
holiday
ale
drinkability
is
about
average
i
wouldnt
mind
another
but
i
wont
be
searching
for
one
either
it
goes
down
easy
the
beer
pours
an
amber
color
with
a
thick
white

the
aroma
is
of
lager
and
victory

there
is
a
slight
scent
of
nuts
the
taste
is
malty
with
the
addition
of
victory

add
the
nutty
flavor

beer
quite
enjoyable
this

the

just
as
the
name
states
roasted

some
sweetness
the
flavor
is
very
smooth
with
the
taste
coming
from
the
roasted

it
has

good
its

full
flavored
merlin48
i
picked
this
one
up
as
part
of
the
saranac
holiday
12
pack
an
above
average
nut
brown
beer
as
with
other
saranac
offerings
i
wouldnt
go
out
of
my
way
for
it
but
still
very
pleasant
and
so
far
the
best
of
the
12
appearance
ruby
copper
red
with
a
nice
fluffy
cream
colored
head
leaves
little
lacing
not
too
impressive
aroma
full
on
toasted
nuts
this
one
is
very
similar
to
the
erie
railbender
in
my
opinion
not
bad
at
all
they
do
a
nice
job
im
not
sure
what
they
are
talking
about
the
bottle
as
far
as
belgian
malts
in
a
nut
brown
lager
but
whatever
floats
their
boat
taste
nice
rolling
toasted
nut
tones
not
overly
sweet
nice
earthy
hop
bitterness
in
the
finish
simple
but
nice
mouthfeel
a
bit
overcarbonated
is
the
only
thing
bad
about
the
texture
other
than
that
a
lighter
to
medium
bodied
amber
colored
lager
not
bad
drinkability
pretty
tasty
i
could
picture
myself
enjoying
a
couple
of
these
very
nice
toned
down
compared
to
beers
i
have
had
as
of
late

should
enjoy
at

fingered
persistent
off
white
head
leaves
frothy
sparse
lace
sweet
biscuit
along
with
a
nutty
sugary
marzipan
like
impression
dominates
the
aroma
bitter
chocolate
and
woody
hop
tones
timidly
arise
as
the
brew
warms
akin
to
a
dunkel
english
nut
brown
ale
hybrid
in
aroma
gentle
dark
toffee
sweetness
initially
in
flavor
is
ensued
by
mild
toasted
grain
notes
hop
flavor
is
more
herbal
than
expected
from
the
aroma
with
definite
green
hersbrucker
hints
hop
bitterness
is
above
the
norm
for
a
dunkel
but
remains
gentle
and
pleasantly
drying
once
tepid
cocoa
eeks
in
mid
palate
the
flavor
remains
static
with
little
change
other
than
trace
salty
cracker
notes
that
emerge
in
the
finish
well
attenuated
but
sufficiently
dextrinous
and
smooth
in
mouthfeel
once
the
initial
carbonic
bite
subsides
a
relatively
tasty
dunkel
with
an
innocuous
one
dimensional
overall
character
impressively
clean
well
brewed
and
drinkable
though
hm
a
nut
brown
lager
decided
it
would
be
worth
a
try
pours
deep
copper
with
a
mediumsized
head
that
dissipates
rather
quickly
rich
malty
nose
quite
enjoyable
on
the
palate
malty
nutty
a
hint
of
brown
sugar
or
molasses
gives
a
slight
warming
feeling
down
the
throat
too
its
a
bit
like
newcastle
only
slightly
darker
and
a
bit
fizzier
i
have
to
say
i
like
it
medium
bodied
drinkable
but
less
than
exciting
for
a
winter
seasonal
lager
excellent
appearence
with
a
brown
amber
color
and
tanoff
white
head
has
a
floral
hoppy
aroma
with
a
rich
malty
hint
chocolaty
chewy
taste
very
nicely
balanced
has
a
spicy
hoppy
aftertaste
wouldnt
know
this
is
a
lager
if
it
didnt
say
so
on
the
bottle
very
nice
and
very
drinkable
foamy
pale
tan
head
had
decent
staying
power
and
left
some
nice
lacing
the
beer
is
clear
and
dark
chestnut
in
color
the
aroma
is
all
malt
maybe
a
bit
much
for
a
nut
brown
but
since
this
is
a
lager
and
not
an
ale
it
makes
a
little
more
sense
the
flavor
is
a
lot
more
balanced
nice
nutty
maltiness
is
replaced
a
dry
hop
bitterness
in
the
finnish
i
havent
had
too
many
nut
brown
lagers
but
this
is
a
decent
beer
a
little
syrupy
even
im
not
sure
what
to
make
of
this
the
sugars
are
felt
rather
than
tasted
i
wouldnt
want
to
tackle
more
than
one
of
these
in
a
sitting
however
its
a
nice
departure
from
the
usual
saranac
method
of
throwing
hops
at
an
average
brew
until
its
passable
wow
this
saranac
has
a
little
balance
to
it
last
year
i
was
very
disappointed
by
the
12
beers
pack
but
this
is
the
first
one
this
year
and
it
is
doing
pretty
well
nice
backround
of
sweet
malts
and
the
hoppiness
is
there
as
well
a
touch
of
caramel
at
the
start
and
then
it
drops
out
of
the
way
for
a
bit
of
bitterness
a
nice
flavorful
brew
it
is
not
a
world
class
brew
but
it
is
very
drinkable
and
tasty
well
done
on
this
one
i
found
the
dark
amber
appearance
a
bit
misleading
much
lighter
in
taste
and
feel
than
expected
but
a
good
overall
winter
seasonal
from
saranac
like
most
saranac
beers
i
wouldnt
go
out
of
my
way
to
find
it
but
would
certainly
have
no
problem
drinking
this
one
again
an
above
average
offering
from
saranac
nice
dark
brown
appearance
staying
head
flavors
of
nuts
chocolate
and
coffee
interplay
a
solid
brew
typically
found
only
in
the
specailty
packs
aroma
of
caramel
and
other
sweet
malts
the
sweet
malt
flavors
are
right
up
front
not
much
bitter
or
hop
flavor
but
theyre
not
necessary
here
the
mouth
feel
is
substantial
and
not
watery
at
all
this
is
a
really
good
lager
i
could
drink
several
of
these
tasty
beers
with
no

in

out
of

this
beer
was
a

retention
of
the

beige
head
the
aroma
was
of
breadybiscuity
malt
and
a
little
sweetness
from
some
caramel
malt
with
a
touch
of
herbal
hobs
and
vanilla
the
flavors
were
similar
with
the
caramel

sweetness
coming
forth
clearly
with
the
herbal
hops
remaining
in
the
background
a
little
butter
hints

overall
rather
bland
the
mouthfeel
was
average
the

medium
and
the
carbonation
right
on
ok
but
forgettable
notes
for
the
style
it
seems
just
a
little
on
the
light
side
but
everything
is
in
good
balance
for
the
style
once
again
saranac
has
brewed
another
decent
easy
drinking
beer
overall
a
nice
little
lager
nothing
really
earth
shattering
but
nice
and
clean
as
vienna
lagers
go
this
one
was
only
fair
nowhere
near
as
flavorful
as
other
some
of
the
other
viennas
ive
had
lingers
in
the
mouth
perhaps
a
bit
too
long
but
otherwise
a
great
and
easy
to
drink
beer
d
easy
to
drink
nicely
balanced
but
for
the
most
part
kind
of
bland
nothing
earth
shattering

this
one
manages
to
cling

the

on

balanced
well
with
the

bitterness
very
crisp
finish
light
feel
and
moderate
carb
nothing
super
exciting
but
overall
not
bad
this
beer
poured
a
dark
brown
with
a
twofinger
head
the
smell
is
a
mix
of
sweet
biscuity
malt
with
a
smattering
of
spices
the
taste
is
a
pretty
good
reflection
of
the
smell
i
should
have
paid
more
attention
to
the
label
on
the
bottle
to
figure
out
exactly
what
kind
of
spices
they
used
but
it
was
a
nice
addition
without
turning
the
beer
into
something
thats
like
drinking
potpourri
a
nice
solid
beer
thats
probably
one
of
the
better
ones
in
the
winter
holiday
pack
i
liked
this
brew
a
lot
and
could
see
myself
drinking
several
of
these
d
a
light
winter
lager
yeah
thats
what
this
one
feels
like
to
me
good
interpretation
of
one
but
watered
down
even
so
it
could
certainly
be
a
session
brew
and
even
beer
rookies
might
enjoy
this
one
drinkability
a
very
easy
drinking
vienna
lager
i
do
prefer
this
to
some
of
the
more
commercial
ones
out
there
however
i
do
find
the
roasted
malts
a
bit
distracting
and
not
true
to
style
it
maybe
kinda
suited
as
a
winter
lager
if
they
bottled
this
year
round
it
might
make
a
good
addition
to
saranacs
line
up
overall
not
a
great
brew
but
worth
trying
and
worth
drinking
if
its
around
however
this
is
only
available
in
the
12
beers
of
winter
my
pour
resulted
in
two
fingers
worth
of
eggnogcolored

not
great

i

mouthfeel
is
okay

drinkablility
is
high
this
is
a
really
good

too
bad
its

this
would
make

overall
a
fairly
nice
winter
lager
that
definitely
warms
you
however
the
odd
bitterness
and
lack
of
balance
seems
to
detract
from
my
desire
to
seek
this
out
poured
into
a
pilsner
style
glass
nice
copper
color
with
a
head
the
quickly
turns
into
a
film
sporatic
lacing
hint
of
caramel
in
the
finish
not
a
bad
beer
by
any
means
but
strangely
nondiscript
one
of
the
weaker
beers
in
the
saranac
winter
sampler
which
i
highly
recommend
picking
up
copped
as
part
of
a
twelvepack
winter
sampler
one
of
the
better
brews
in
the
bunch
but
still
nothing
to
write
home
about
pretty
bland
and
nondescript
in
terms
of
overall
flavor
profile
not
enough
substance
in
the
mix
hints
of
bread
butter
and
caramel
struggle
to
be
noticed
not
recommended
d
very
enjoyable
well
balanced
brew
across
the
spectrum
d
though
not
particularly
complex
the
flavors
are
wellbalanced
and
definitely
capture
the
spirit
of
the
winter
a
good
afterwork
beer
for
the
colder
months
drinks
okay
but
a
bit
weak
uninteresting
maybe
one
of
the
most
disappointing
saranac
beers
ive
had
part
of
a
case
version
of
their
twelve
beers
of
winter
double
the
enjoyment
for
the
holidays
nice
longneck
was
poured
into
a
tall
slender
german
lager
glass
a
hard
pour
produced
a
couple
healthy
inches
of
creamcolored
head
on
top
of
a
darker
than
expected
amber
colored
liquid
very
lively
carbonation
working
its
way
up
through
smells
of
golden
brown
toast
some
cooked
vegetable
and
sweet
malt
flavors
include
lightly
toasted
malt
some
light
caramel
sweetness
cooked
vegetable
and
a
metallic
bitterness
in
the
finish
feel
in
the
mouth
is
medium
with
a
bright
carbonation
this
is
a
pretty
easy
drinking
beer
for
the
season
that
is
dominated
by
heavier
stronger
ales
this
lager
is
close
to
being
very
good
but
falls
a
little
short
compared
to
some
of
their
others
i
think
a
nice
mix
up
to
the
winter
pack
drinkability
nothing
stands
out
about
this
beer
but
it
is
tasty
nontheless
id
drink
it
again
mouthfeel
is
of
a
rather
light
body
but
very
crisp
overall
an
enjoyable
refreshing
brew
very
easy
to
enjoy
several
of
these
at
once
cheers
d
the
fuller
malts
add
a
great
deal
to
the
body
strengthening
it
up
significantly
another
good
lagerbier
from
saranac
part
of
the
saranac
twelve
beers
of
winter
pack
poured
aclear
bronze
with
a
tight
one
finger
bone
white
head
that
left
decent
lace
as
it
settled
pretty
slowly
not
much
in
the
aromasome
lingering
spice
and
caramel
bit
its
really
light
flavors
are
much
of
the
samelightly
sweet
caramel
and
some
toasted
malt
but
really
thats
about
it
eh
pretty
ho
humnot
a
real
vienna
lager
in
its
true
form
by
any
means
drinkability
this
is
an
above
average
attempt
at
the
style
that
is
easy
to
session
i
could
have
six
of
these
while
watching
a
game
but
it
is
not
anything
i
would
get
too
excited
about
still
a
very
solid
effort

just
not
as
soft
as
it
should
be
overall
tasty
vienna
style
not
the
best
but
a
solid
approachable
beer
for
any
of
the
in
laws
during
the
holidays
this
was
a
pleasant
beer
not
especially
big
assertive
or
unusual
just
a
really
nice
balanced
malty
lager
rich
enjoyable
to
drink
overall
a
nice
winter
lager
is
what
this
beer
is
very
drinkable
and
to
the
style
thanks
jason
for
this
extra
i
am
glad
i
got
to
try
it
d
nice
if
not
mild
winter
lager
very
drinkable

pours
a
nice
semi
see
through
brown
color
little
wisp
of

some
lacing
for
a
winter
lager
this
is
definitely
on
the
light
bodied
side
not
the
typical
heartyheavy
winter
seasonal
still
pretty
drinkable
though
not
too
much
there
flavor
wise
if
this
is
a
vienna
lager
id
much
rather
have
boston
lager
that
one
has
a
lot
more
pronounced
flavors
than
this
one
not
bad
but
ive
had
a
lot
better
ones
from
this
brewery
rest
of
their
winter
mixed
pack
is
better
from
the
12
fl
oz
bottle
2009
batch
marked
26490834
sampled
on
nov
11
2009
the
pour
is
a
darker
amber
color
with
a
lot
of
bubbly
carbonation
flowing
upward
to
a
thin
offwhite
head
the
lacing
is
limited
in
the
aroma
i
note
some
muted
malts
and
hops
with
something
a
bit
fruity
and
grassy
the
mouthfeel
is
thin
the
taste
has
a
bit
more
to
offer
than
the
aroma
with
a
hint
of
caramel
bitterness
with
a
slightly
bolder
hoppy
finish
but
overall
it
is
quite
average
although
easy
to
drink
but
with
the
character
of
a
cheaper
winter
lager
for
a
slightly
larger
dollar
overall
my
1st
from
this
years
winter
variety
pack
and
a
decent
offering
a
good
1
to
start
off
the
night
with
it
would
probably
go
alright
with
burger
and
fries
pours
a
crystal
clear
amber
color
with
a
tight
eggshell
colored
head
that
settles
into
a
light
ring
the
aroma
is
of
a
light
caramel
malt
a
bit
bready
with
hints
of
copper
the
taste
is
of
caramel
malt
a
little
doughy
light
spice
and
a
touch
of
grassy
hops
all
of
the
flavors
are
rather
light
the
feel
is
light
but
not
watery
plenty
of
carbonation
well
balanced
finishes
with
an
ever
so
slight
bitter
hop
this
is
a
darn
refreshing
beer
very
clean
flavors
and
very
crisp
no
offputting
flavors
not
the
most
flavorful
brew
but
its
very
drinkable
great
to
session
not
what
i
was
expecting
more
of
a
lighter
octoberfest
cant
say
i
am
familiar
with
the
vienna
style
lager
before
this
one
still
it
is
done
well
well
balanced
albeit
a
bit
uninteresting
i
tend
to
go
for
darker
ales
in
the
winter
overall
a
decent
lager
the
strange
sweetness
adversely
affected
the
experience
for
me
12oz
bottle
purchased
as
part
of
a
seasonal
12pack
at
shaws
in
windham
nh
pours
a
crystal
clear
amber
to
red
body
with
a
good
inch
of
shortlived
offwhite
head
smells
slightly
caramel
malty
with
a
bit
of
a
soapy
quality
tastes
malty
with
caramel
chocolate
and
a
slight
fruity
medium
in
both
body
and
carbonation
while
the
aroma
was
a
bit
discouraging
the
flavor
was
pleasant
and
balanced
and
as
good
as
any
other
vienna
ive
had
d
very
drinkable
prob
one
of
the
better
am
brewed
viennas
out
there
i
wish
they
had
6rs
of
this
nice
good
beer
with
an
overall
malty
taste
that
releases
more
malt
flavor
and
taste
as
it
warms
up
and
goes
down
easy
not
exceptional
flavor
but
quite
drinkable
very
nice
i
could
swear
that
its
a
clone
of
the
sa
version
very
easy
to
drink
and
tasty
definitely
one
of
the
better
beers
from
saranac
cheers
d
alright
not
my
favorite
from
the
12
beers
of
winter
pack
a
little
thin
and
not
as
flavorful
as
it
could
be
saranac
winter
lager
is
a
clear
amber
beer
with
a
fluffy
off
white
head
that
has
decent
retention
it
smells
slightly
sweet
malty
and
peppery
its
mediumlight
bodied
and
the
finish
is
a
little
gritty
it
has
a
peppery
twang
thats
balanced
well
with
a
green
botanical
bitterness
that
lasts
through
the
finish
theres
nothing
really
standout
here
