i
do
not
know
if
this
proposal
is
even
but
found
no
body
and
so
the
smoky
artificial
id
rather
be
wrong
foam
almost
absent
and
elusive
the
smoked
only
felt
in
the
aftertaste
a
sessionable
rauchbier
maybe
worth
it
as
an
entrance
for
beginners
but
far
from
the
usual
smoked
intense
for
the
style
o
good
drinkability
great
rauchbier
made
in
brazil
a
single
i
picked
up
since
i
liked
the
weizenbock
i
tried
from
this
brewery
and
smoked
beers
are
interesting
this
is
a
pretty
decent
smoked
beerrauch
not
overpowering
in
the
smokiness
but
gives
a
nice
smoked
sausage
flavor
worth
a
shot
o
i
bought
this
in
a
mixasix
because
my
daughter
liked
the
picture
of
the
train
on
the
label
glad
she
did
i
didnt
pay
attention
to
the
cost
of
the
bottle
or
of
a
sixpack
so
i
dont
know
if
it
was
worth
what
i
spent
but
i
think
so
i
think
this
is
going
to
be
the
thanksgivingdinner
sixpack
this
year
the
eisenbahn
rauchbier
was
available
a
figiera
restaurant
in
sao
paulo
i
tried
this
beer
after
the
pale
ale
the
rauch
or
smoke
beer
was
ok
the
appearance
was
a
rich
clear
amber
and
a
decent
white
head
was
present
the
scent
was
somewhat
smokey
but
not
dominate
the
taste
was
decent
malt
and
grain
present
with
tinges
of
roastsmoke
the
mouthfeel
was
slightly
downgraded
because
alcohol
was
definitely
present
overall
a
decent
beer
and
worth
a
try
medium
mouthfeel
and
medium
carbonation
a
nice
solid
surprisingly
clean
offering
with
more
of
a
tendency
towards
a
visceral
subtle
meatiness
than
sinus
or
palate
searing
smoke
a
nice
beer
would
surely
try
again
pours
a
clear
rust
color
12
inch
head
of
an
offwhite
color
good
retention
and
slight
lacing
smells
of
smoke
sweet
malt
slight
roasted
malt
and
a
hint
of
grain
fits
the
style
of
rauchbier
mouth
feel
is
smooth
and
clean
with
an
average
carbonation
level
tastes
of
smoke
sweet
malt
slight
roasted
malt
slight
earthy
malt
hint
of
grain
and
a
hint
of
hops
overall
a
lot
better
then
the
dourada
good
mouth
feel
and
blend
overall
sweet
rich
malts
and
caramel
very
nicely
balance
the
moderate
smoke
in
this
which
creates
decent
complexity
and
interest
for
a
smoke
beer
especially
one
as
sweet
as
this
one
this
is
highly
drinkable
and
enjoyable
fairly
unimpressed
with
this
but
will
happily
give
this
a
second
chance
with
a
fresh
bottle
if
anyone
from
oz
wants
to
import
another
batch
gets
slightly
cloying
after
a
while
with
the
sweetness
raising
its
head
once
too
often
it
doesnt
strike
me
as
a
particularly
good
rauch
but
it
has
its
moments
drinkability
is
very
good
this
is
a
nice
one
to
have
when
youd
like
a
little
smoke
but
not
too
much
it
is
a
pretty
good
rauchbier
poured
from
a
brown
12
oz
bottle
has
a
caramel
color
with
a
12
inch
head
smell
is
mild
some
malts
taste
is
good
malts
and
smokes
meat
some
notes
of
hops
feels
light
in
the
mouth
and
has
average
drinkability
overall
a
pretty
interesting
and
not
bad
beer
pours
a
clear
amberbrown
with
about
a
finger
of
light
head
that
leaves
little
lacing
on
the
glass
the
smell
is
of
mesquite
bbq
with
hints
of
green
apple
cocoa
and
plums
the
taste
begins
with
a
subtly
sweet
maltiness
allowing
the
smokiness
to
build
up
behind
that
maltiness
is
what
lingers
in
the
aftertaste
though
rather
than
the
smoke
as
would
be
expected
the
medium
body
coupled
with
the
overall
sweetness
makes
for
a
more
drinkable
rauch
than
usual
quite
drinkable
for
a
rauchbier
though
i
find
myself
preferring
the
boldness
of
the
richer
smokier
versions
ddamn
solid
certainly
not
the
best
rauchbier
i
have
ever
had
but
considering
this
is
made
in
brazilwell
color
me
impressed
a
pleasant
well
made
and
easy
drinking
brew
i
think
xingu
will
have
to
take
a
back
seat
to
my
new
favorite
beer
from
brazil
this
is
an
excellent
lager
taste
is
smokey
but
again
not
too
much
so
quite
malty
in
the
smokeiness
with
light
stewed
plumapple
fruitiness
hint
of
caramel
mineral
quality
its
lightly
sweet
before
a
more
dry
zesty
minerallyleafy
herb
finish
it
has
light
grain
elements
throughout
too
and
is
very
easy
to
drink
it
is
perhaps
on
the
thin
side
and
sweet
side
and
is
not
too
complex
but
has
good
character
that
hold
up
well
dont
know
if
anyone
would
want
to
polish
off
a
full
6
of
these
all
in
one
sitting
but
i
sure
wouldnt
mind
another
one
overall
a
fine
beer
the
smoked
flavor
is
interesting
and
though
not
my
personal
favorite
i
give
this
beer
a
good
rating
because
it
is
different
from
the
usual
import
lager
overall
this
was
a
pretty
good
rauchbier
the
flavors
certainly
improve
as
the
beer
warms
so
be
sure
to
let
this
one
get
to
a
good
temperature
worth
a
shot

would

again

called
brazil

over

considering
it
a
beer

it
is

to
see
craft
beer
taking

i
like
this
style
and
while
this
is
no
great
beer
its
pretty
good
i
wonder
if
the
brazilian
restaurant
in
the
city
serves
this
they
should
well
brewed
if
i
could
be
guaranteed
to
get
ahold
of
this
fresh
id
love
to
try
some
more
from
this
brewer
mdboth
are
fine
with
higher
marks
to
drinkability
just
because
the
subtlety
of
the
smoke
doesnt
overpower
your
palate
better
for
a
more
offbeat
session
than
for
something
thats
gonna
knock
your
socks
off
with
noveltyfor
those
expecting
a
sock
of
smoke
youll
be
disappointed
and
probably
even
bored
could
have
been
more
flavorful
for
the
abv
very
drinkable
as
it
is
smoky
but
not
overly
so
allowing
other
characteristics
to
come
through
that
complement
the
smokiness
well
alcohol
is
wellmasked
solid
choice
for
a
smoky
but
not
overpowering
brew
with
a
balanced
maltiness
a
very
nice
one
here
picked
up
a
single
bottle
at
nikkis
liquors
in
ri
poured
into
my
nonic
pint
glass
a
clear
golden
amber
color
with
a
quickly
vanishing
offwhite
head
smells
mildly
of
smoked
malts
and
burnt
caramel
with
a
unique
taffy
like
sweetness
tastes
of
sweet
brown
sugar
coated
smoked
ribs
the
smoke
is
mild
and
not
overpowering
a
bit
thin
in
body
with
medium
carbonation
it
did
not
take
long
for
my
glass
to
become
empty
worth
a
try
if
you
see
it
but
where
this
shines
like
i
mentioned
before
is
its
drinkability
it
is
so
balanced
and
actually
really
feminine
for
a
beer
of
this
style
i
could
easily
but
back
a
sixer
of
this
i
guess
i
was
dreaming
of
a
bit
more
smoke
its
great
that
so
many
delicious
micros
are
coming
from
latin
america
this
is
one
ill
seek
out
down
in
brazil
this
summer
for
sure
amber
brown
color
with
pretty
hues
of
orange
and
yellow
found
at
the
bottom
edge
of
the
glass
it
has
a
sweet
aroma
a
mix
of
smoked
meat
and
sweet
pale
malt
its
mellow
the
taste
is
a
surprise
to
my
expectations
not
very
smoky
but
not
very
intense
a
surprise
given
its
6
5
listed
on
the
bottle
theres
some
juicy
meat
flavor
found
but
its
leans
more
towards
a
helles
lager
no
odd
flavors
either
a
good
rauchbier
to
be
had
and
one
that
paired
well
with
homemade
churrasco
poured
a
12oz
bottle
into
my
new
belgian
globe
this
beer
pours
a
dark
caramel
with
just
a
slight
off
white
head
that
completely
disappeared
leaving
no
remnants
left
behind
in
my
glass
the
aroma
is
distinctly
smoked
barley
not
that
fake
liquid
smoke
aroma
that
you
find
in
so
many
rauchbiers
its
not
overpowering
but
it
is
definitely
the
most
distinctive
aroma
in
it
a
nice
meaty
smoke
the
flavor
is
just
a
really
subtle
smoke
complement
very
well
by
a
sweet
caramel
malty
backbone
the
mouthfeel
is
a
very
light
and
smooth
but
just
a
little
to
dry
for
me
i
can
honestly
say
that
this
is
the
first
rauchbier
i
have
truly
enjoyed
strong
copper
color
with
some
light
ruby
and
hay
colored
highlights
very
light
tan
two
finger
head
after
a
zealous
pour
pretty
good
retention
and
some
sticking
after
each
sip
smokey
bread
and
old
world
candy
aroma
the
hops
and
yeast
combine
to
add
a
touch
of
spicy
fruit
to
the
nose
starts
with
soesoft
campfire
toasted
malt
that
give
a
note
of
fruity
coffee
cakeroasted
plums
mix
with
a
faint
peppermint
hop
lingering
in
the
back
of
the
tongue
medium
smokey
smooth
body
maybe
not
sessionable
in
my
book
but
still
a
drinkable
beer
this
beer
pours
a
murky
ruby
color
the
head
is
one
inch
in
height
and
recedes
slowly
into
nice
lacing
the
aroma
is
of
caramel
and
toffee
malt
with
a
smoke
undercurrent
the
taste
is
a
bit
smokier
than
the
aroma
and
there
is
still
a
solid
malt
presence
the
mouthfeel
is
medium
bodied
with
a
lot
of
carbonation
which
seems
to
slightly
get
in
the
way
of
the
taste
overall
this
is
a
decent
rauchbier
that
i
could
drink
again
but
there
are
better
examples
out
to
be
had
overall
i
would
not
get
it
again
but
it
was
interesting
whatever
style
you
want
to
call
it
it
was
interesting
d
this
is
a
nice
stab
at
a
rauchbier
it
wasnt
quite
a
schlenkerla
but
its
unfair
to
judge
everyone
against
that
if
you
like
rauchbier
try
this
it
wont
disappoint
huge
thanks
to
schellsbeer
overall
impressed
with
my
first
brazilian
beer
will
i
search
this
one
out
probably
not
since
it
is
2
50
per
bottle
before
taxes
and
i
can
have
a
three
feet
down
for
much
less
than
that
however
great
experience
if
you
have
the
chance
i
say
try
one
i
have
2
that
i
am
going
to
enjoy
poured

pretty
quick
no

is
salted
meat
with
a
mild
phenolic
plastic
note
some

the
smoke
making
this
beer
less
intense
than
the
schlenkerla
rauchbiers
flavor
is
pretty
much
identical
nice
light
smokiness
not
like
drinking
a
christmas

pretty

lacks

of

i
would

i

again

pretty
full
in
the
mouth
goes
well
with

sweet
and
smoke
kissed
til
next
time
this
beer
holds
together
beautifully
with
neither
the
sweetness
nor
the
smoke
coming
across
as
heavyhanded
an
absolute
charmer
of
a
rauchbier
which
could
satisfy
a
fan
of
the
style
without
putting
off
the
curious
novice
who
has
never
tasted
one
before
drinkability
is
good
this
is
by
no
means
a
style
i
seek
out
but
this
offering
is
very
impressive
an
oily
malt
sweetness
cuts
the
smoke
perfectly
making
this
an
extremely
drinkable
example
for
the
style
thanks
to
this
im
now
craving
a
big
plate
o
ribs
quite
a
tasty
and
satisfying
smoke
with
the
medium
lager
mouthfeel
backdropping
the
right
amount
of
smoked
malt
flavour
with
some
long
finish
and
some
complexity
sweetish

not
too
sweet

tiny
white

significant

pours
an
interesting

with
ok
white

nose
is
slight
smoke

good

with

some
roast
and
noticeable
smoke
flavor
a
good
crisp
finish
adequate
carbonation
in
the

pretty
good

an
interesting
style
done
fairly
well
i
love
rauchbier
but
im
not
sure
i
like
it
in
a
lager
form
it
would
be
good
for
an
introduction
to
the
style
for
those
unfamiliar
it
is
good
but
it
is
nothing
particularly
special
or
flavorful
good
beer
just
not
amazing
i
wasnt
crazy
in
love
with
it
but
it
had
its
place
and
seemed
to
me
to
be
a
clean
smoky
interpretation
of
the
style
that
could
serve
both
as
entrypoint
and
reference
point
for
rauchbiers
pours
a
nice
clear
and
darker
copper
with
a
thinner
creme
head
nose
is
only
slightly
smoked
flavor
is
actually
pretty
good
nice
smooth
smokiness
nice
malty
edge
its
nice
smooth
feel
with
a
slightly
biting
carbonation
to
it
like
i
said
its
nice
a
smooth
and
unobtrusive
rauch
thats
quite
easy
to
drink
purchased
plaza
liquors
tucson
az
mouthfeel
is
medium
light
the
smoked
malt
lingers
in
the
mouth
very
pleasing
this
is
drinkable
for
sure
but
is
actually
a
bit
filling
or
maybe
i
was
full
from
dinner
if
you
happen
to
see
it
somewhere
pick
it
up
and
give
it
a
try
definately
recommended
i
bought
this
bottle
at
stimmels
market
in
bowling
green
ohio
the
label
says
defumada
eisenbahm
smoked
lager
batch
06
i
chose
the
sam
adams
uberglass
for
the
occasion
of
my
1st
brazilian
craft
beer
everything
about
this
beer
was
spoton
its
as
if
they
rebottled
something
from
bamburg
the
beer
was
copper
colored
and
crystal
clear
like
a
sun
tea
the
smell
was
smoked
malts
with
a
hint
of
sweetness
the
flavor
was
definitive
rauchbier
smoky
aftertaste
but
not
so
much
as
to
seem
like
a
campfire
delicious
easy
to
pound
and
completely
recommended
a
good
amount
of
carbonation
very
refreshing
aftertaste
is
of
caramelized
sugar
dark
fruits
and
a
little
dry
prost
an
interesting
beer
a
nice
introduction
to
the
style
highly
recommended
a
very
good
smoked
beer
from
brazil
no
less
wish
i
had
bought
more
than
2
bottles
d
this
is
an
excellent
rauchbier
im
very
pleasantly
surprised
by
this
brewery
from
brasil
i
guess
i
didnt
expect
that
much
and
they
keep
surprising
me
with
wonderful
beers
this
one
being
a
great
example
drinkability
a
restrained
even
sensible
smokiness
for
an
altogether
balanced
beer
i
never
thought
id
use
the
word
sensible
when
describing
a
rauchbier
but
there
it
is
appears
a
ruby
amber
tone
nice
velvety
light
tan
head
dwindles
slowly
leaves
behind
fine
even
lacing
looking
good
smelling
even
better
smoked
rauchbier
at
its
finest
smoked
meats
and
peated
malt
accents
burnt
wood
with
sweet
fruit
malt
undertones
not
getting
much
hops
but
thats
okay
i
never
have
from
a
true
rauchbier
flavors
like
camp
fire
roasted
caramel
covered
nuts
and
smoked
meats
combine
to
form
a
slight
woody
flavor
with
enough
malts
coming
through
to
really
forms
a
tasty
balanced
smoked
lager
a
touch
of
alcohol
and
sweet
ripened
plums
combine
but
the
lingering
smokiness
is
killer
really
great
brew
texture
wise
i
get
fine
even
carbonation
even
a
bit
bubbly
medium
bodied
ale
with
lingering
presence
on
the
palate
due
to
the
dry
smokiness
drinkability
is
nice
i
could
see
myself
indulging
on
a
couple
bottles
of
this
stuff
smoked
beer
grows
on
you
especially
after
a
couple
in
a
session
this
would
be
addictive
for
me
especially
with
some
assorted
meats
and
cheeses
crystalclear
brown
with
candy
corn
coloration
around
the
edges
thin
wisp
of
resilient
foam
aroma
gives
off
even
parts
honey
and
beechwoody
smoke
medium
smoke
nose
smells
rich
and
multidimensional
first
sip
is
a
tad
sweet
immediately
lots
of
that
uber
malty
german
pils
character
once
my
mouth
is
coated
with
that
sensation
further
sips
contain
more
and
more
of
this
wonderfully
subversive
smokiness
definite
balanced
mix
between
the
bambergstyle
which
is
all
smoke
and
no
wood
and
a
smoky
flavor
one
would
associate
with
a
bourbon
barrelaged
beer
the
latter
might
be
perceived
as
the
beer
leans
toward
the
heavier
richer
side
of
lagers
but
who
the
fuck
cares
this
beer
goes
down
easy
like
a
hooker
on
hunts
point
next
to
the
rauchator
dopplebock
from
fort
collins
this
is
my
second
favorite
smoked
beer
of
all
time
beats
the
piss
out
of
schlenkerla
helles
why
didnt
i
buy
a
sixer
of
this
next
time
drinkability
i
like
my
smoked
beers
to
be
subtle
but
discernable
and
this
is
one
of
the
best
examples
i
have
found
a
masterful
achievement
d
this
beer
has
some
nice
malt
flavors
but
the
smoke
is
a
bit
odd
that
being
said
most
breweries
cant
get
the
smoke
correct
for
stouts
and
porters
so
im
very
impressed
that
they
attempted
a
lager
with
smoke
they
really
made
a
smoked
lager
better
than
i
could
ever
expect
quite
a
refreshing
beer
on
a
hot
day
this
is
an
unbelievable
rauchbier
perfectly
integrated
big
and
chewy
complexity
rich
coating
thick
mouthfeel
and
very
easily
drinkable
melted
heath
bar
with
milk
duds
on
the
side
big
chewy
fresh
caramel
smoke
isnt
overpowering
at
all
and
lends
a
great
compliment
to
the
thick
malts
a
slight
hop
bitterness
on
the
2
minute
finish
easily
one
of
the
best
lagers
ive
tasted
reasonably
good
beer
a
nice
surprise
from
my
country
not
exactly
known
from
great
beers
but
a
little
below
what
i
expect
from
rauchbiers
perhaps
a
good
introduction
for
nonrauchbier
lovers
but
i
prefer
the
wicked
smoked
flavors
of
the
german
counterparts
d
admittedly
i
didnt
have
much
hope
for
a
rauch
coming
from
brazilian
brewery
fortunately
i
was
quite
wrong
this
beer
is
very
drinkable
and
is
pleasant
in
all
areas
the
subtlty
of
the
smoked
malt
makes
this
a
great
introduction
to
rauchbiers
before
jumping
into
the
schenkerlas
finish
is
clean
a
nice
caramel
malt
driven
lager
the
smoky
aftertaste
hangs
around
long
enough
to
be
effective
but
is
also
whisked
nicely
off
the
palate
by
scrubbing
hops
all
around
a
very
nice
brew
this
is
a
style
i
am
warming
up
to
a
bit
and
i
have
read
and
heard
some
really
good
stuff
about
this
brazilian
brewer
so
it
was
a
no
brainer
for
me
to
pick
this
up
today
poured
into
a
5
liter
stein
a
deep
rich
amber
with
a
swirling
tight
1
one
finger
off
white
head
very
nice
clarity
to
the
pourthe
smoke
is
prominent
but
there
is
a
big
brown
sugar
and
taostiness
to
compliment
the
hardwood
smoke
starts
off
sweet
before
the
smoke
cuts
thru
it
a
nice
mix
of
brown
sugar
sweetness
and
smoke
like
a
brown
sugar
cured
smoked
ham
a
very
well
made
rauchbier
better
than
alot
of
bamburg
ones
i
have
had
eisenbahn
impresses
in
my
first
encounter
with
them
hooked
up
with
this
beer
thanks
to
msubulldog25
much
respect
flyin
out
to
b
to
tha
g
the
beer
fills
the
glass
with
a
deep
copper
hue
the
finger
of
very
bubbly
head
falls
quickly
to
a
quarter
inch
over
top
though
a
constant
stream
of
bubbles
helps
to
keep
it
stationary
there
the
color
is
very
brilliany
and
clarity
is
fantastic
even
before
getting
near
i
get
excellent
sweet
smokey
notes
wafting
towards
me
taking
a
closer
smell
i
find
a
nice
and
delicate
smokey
character
with
a
more
mild
sweetness
playing
below
that
the
sweetness
from
the
smoke
and
the
malt
play
well
together
and
are
hard
to
tease
apart
the
first
sip
brings
a
reserved
smoke
character
with
a
solid
bready
and
slightly
grainy
malt
base
that
hits
directly
after
the
smoke
the
smoke
then
kicks
again
before
fading
to
a
very
bready
finish
there
is
excellent
balance
between
smoke
and
malt
here
there
is
even
just
a
hint
of
a
hop
bitterness
on
the
finish
i
definitely
get
a
lot
of
the
base
beer
without
feeling
i
lost
any
of
the
rauchbier
character
that
i
love
this
is
excellent
mouthfeel
is
moderate
with
a
light
to
moderate
carbonation
a
little
more
carbonation
would
be
nice
but
that
is
just
my
personal
opinion
overall
this
beer
is
impressive
from
start
to
finish
im
used
to
smoked
beers
with
a
very
dominant
smoke
i
think
i
may
like
the
balance
of
this
more
than
others
i
have
had
i
will
be
having
this
one
again
mouthfeel
is
medium
bodied
and
maybe
a
touch
sticky
from
the
sweet
malts
with
a
pretty
darn
good
drinkability
drinkability
this
is
an
ideal
candidate
for
an
introduction
to
the
style
not
over
the
top
smoked
like
a
schlenkerla
rauchbier
but
definitely
enough
to
get
a
feel
for
the
style
beer
tasting
candidate
for
certain
perhaps
the
most
sessionable
smoker
ive
had
the
mouthfeel
is
moderately
heavy
for
a
lager
which
i
like
and
somewhat
creamy
unlike
a
lot
of
rauch
beers
i
could
drink
a
few
of
these
in
a
row
but
more
because
of
its
great
balance
and
not
because
it
lacks
a
notable
smokiness
if
blindfolded
i
believe
id
most
closely
compare
it
to
a
scotch
ale
in
flavor
it
is
a
subtly
smoky
beer
which
might
make
it
a
good
introduction
to
the
style
thank
you
to
todd
the
beer
guy
at
mckean
and
charles
in
waldoboro
for
getting
me
to
try
this
i
never
would
have
tried
it
without
his
suggestion
and
then
i
would
have
really
missed
out
this
is
a
great
almost
phenomenal
beer
a
12oz
bottle
batch
06
poured
into
a
pint
glass
dark
amber
color
small
head
faint
campfire
smoke
aroma
with
a
some
fruit
very
pleasant
fruit
malt
taste
with
the
faint
smoke
flavor
coming
in
afterwards
very
subtle
very
comfortable
truly
a
beer
to
enjoy
i
need
to
see
if
tullys
carries
this
because
i
dont
get
up
to
waldoboro
that
often
in
spite
of
the
fact
that
my
bottle
says
defumada
smoked
lager
im
pretty
confident
that
were
talking
about
the
same
beer
and
what
a
beer
it
is
this
brazilian
offering
can
hold
its
head
high
among
the
worlds
best
rauchbiers
i
love
being
surprised
like
this
i
feel
pretty
confident
that
once
word
gets
out
about
this
and
its
more
available
it
will
become
one
of
the
best
of
its
stylegenre
just
a
fantastic
beer
truly
a
barreled
spirit
in
11oz
form
complete
with
the
smoke
if
you
like
single
malts
bourbon
or
whiskey
with
a
little
charcoal
in
the
background
some
caramel
up
front
stone
fruits
here
and
there
and
a
big
chewy
finish
i
cannot
recommend
this
enough
a
new
member
of
my
personal
top
10
perhaps
top
5
seek
this
out
enjoy
overall
a
better
session
candidate
than
bigger
rauchbiers
like
schlenkerla
spezial
and
rauchenfelser
very
clean
and
inviting
dr
as
said
before
its
impossible
to
drink
only
one
another
excelent
beer
from
eisenbahn
the
small
brewerie
from
blumenau
sc
not
a
bad
beer
it
just
doesnt
fit
my
personal
taste
no
too
drinkable
a
couple
are
enough
to
appreciate
goes
very
well
with
pork
meat
roast
beef
and
barbecue
overall
a
tasty
user
friendly
smoked
ale
drinkability
the
smell
of
this
one
is
just
amazing
the
bitterness
at
the
end
is
unique
this
may
be
one
of
the
best
domestic
rauchbiers
i
have
had
i
will
look
for
this
whenever
i
am
in
pennsylvania
it
is
just
a
really
great
beer
sly
fox
continually
impresses
me
with
the
high
quality
of
the
beers
they
churn
out
1343
this
is
my
first
time
having
this
style
so
its
tough
to
review
to
style
that
being
said
this
is
one
delicious
brew
i
was
expecting
smoky
flavors
which
it
has
but
i
wasnt
expecting
such
a
deep
hardwood
palate
there
are
also
a
fair
amount
of
malt
sweetness
that
pulls
it
all
together
i
would
compare
it
to
smoky
version
of
a
scotch
ale
only
with
the
refreshing
qualities
of
a
well
crafted
amber
lager
this
is
certainly
worth
a
taste
if
you
happen
upon
it
cheers
pours
clear
copper
with
big
fluffy
head
aroma
is
strongly
smoky
flavor
is
clean
and
smoky
powerful
yet
delicate
not
overwhelming
it
suggests
leather
and
rich
pipe
smoke
not
so
much
like
a
campfire
as
with
some
rauschbiers
there
is
some
butterscotch
malt
back
there
but
mostly
smoke
mouthfeel
is
quite
delicate
drinkability
this
beer
goes
down
smoothly
and
would
go
well
with
bbq
meats
nice
beer
overall
and
worth
a
try
mdboth
are
excellent
as
the
active
carbonation
brightens
and
lightens
this
enough
to
keep
it
from
being
mouthcoating
its
fairly
thin
thinner
than
the
flavor
profile
would
suggest
which
is
a
necessary
offset
for
such
big
flavors
again
think
bbq
and
not
no
barbecue
chicken
with
like
grilled
scallions
bring
on
the
pulled
pork
gentlemen
id
drink
this
before
the
meat
was
on
the
smoker
when
i
was
getting
the
fire
ready
during
the
smoking
process
when
the
meat
and
wood
smells
were
mixing
and
after
it
was
through
and
i
could
gnaw
my
way
through
some
bones
at
5
2
percent
i
may
just
survive
such
an
endeavor
great
american
take
on
the
style
tied
with
the
aurora
ipa
as
my
favorite
brew
tasted
tonight
out
of
ten
as
expected
light
hef
on
the
body
carbonation
is
a
little
too
strong
even
after
three
weeks
sitting
in
a
bottle
but
it
works
well
with
food
maybe
its
to
keep
the
fat
from
congealing
p
on
tap
111608
the
pint
was
delivered
with
a
clear
deep
amber
almost
chestnut
body
beneath
a
short
head
of
white
that
fades
shortly
but
somehow
manages
to
leave
walls
of
thin
lace
about
the
glass
the
nose
was
smoky
but
not
overdone
its
woody
clearly
beech
and
just
lightly
bacon
or
bbq
hints
of
caramel
are
present
as
well
the
flavor
follows
suit
but
theres
more
caramel
than
the
nose
suggests
the
smokiness
is
flavorful
and
an
integral
part
but
not
commanding
and
very
nicely
balanced
i
was
immediately
surprised
at
how
drinkable
it
was
and
although
i
didnt
have
a
second
pint
i
surely
could
have
i
paired
it
with
the
portobello
sandwich
and
it
complemented
nicely
wellbrewed
superbly
balanced
suprisingly
drinkable
and
worth
seeking
out
drinkability
a
very
drinkable
beer
that
provides
a
balanced
amount
of
flavor
unfortunately
only
available
on
tap
overall
a
highly
session
able
tight
little
ale
from
sly
fox
this
is
a
style
that
can
be
done
incredibly
wrong
if
you
are
not
careful
so
it
was
refreshing
to
see
another
hit
come
out
of
them
go
check
this
one
out
while
it
is
still
available
i
have
this
on
tap
at
home
i
was
very
happy
to
find
a
sixtel
of
this
it
pours
a
dark
clear
amber
with
a
nice
white
head
the
smell
was
smoky
but
not
overdone
i
really
like
the
way
it
seems
to
just
be
around
to
complement
the
sweet
malt
the
smoke
is
a
bit
more
noticeable
in
the
taste
it
really
is
balanced
nice
with
the
malt
the
body
is
almost
full
there
is
a
nice
level
of
carbonation
to
keep
the
body
on
the
light
side
of
full
it
is
very
drinkable
very
smooth
the
flavors
just
keep
coming
for
the
entire
beer
easily
one
of
my
favorite
rauchbiers
in
the
end
its
just
a
basic
rauchbier
that
you
would
give
to
somebody
to
try
and
get
them
into
the
style
for
me
it
was
too
light
for
a
rauchbier
flavor
is
fiery
smoke
with
notes
of
cured
meats
and
barbecue
there
is
a
slight
hop
to
cut
in
but
not
too
noticeable
also
a
touch
of
alcohol
is
present
in
the
flavor
sly
fox
has
done
a
nice
job
of
recreating
this
german
style
without
americanizing
it
too
much
its
not
quite
as
potent
as
some
of
the
more
famous
german
rauchbiers
but
thats
not
necessarily
a
bad
thing
here
nice
job
with
the
style
d
this
is
a
well
crafted
beer
that
is
spot
on
to
the
style
i
could
definately
have
a
few
of
these
on
crisp
fall
afternoons
overall
a
style
im
very
starting
to
enjoy
more
than
ever
solid
smokey
flavor
throughout
good
solid
beer
clear
light
chestnut
deep
amber
with
a
reddish
hue
with
a
short
cap
of
white
foam
good
retention
and
the
fine
bubbles
showed
some
stickage
to
the
glass
very
nice
aroma
all
malt
and
smoke
there
were
notes
of
caramel
and
peat
giving
it
a
singlemalt
scotch
character
also
a
light
ashiness
almost
like
a
campfire
the
smell
was
fairly
mellow
overall
though
solid
bitterness
was
balanced
by
sweet
malt
and
wood
smoke
kind
of
like
a
ham
many
of
the
qualities
of
the
aroma
carried
into
the
flavour
but
the
smokiness
was
more
subdued
mediumlight
body
with
lowish
carbonation
some
dryness
and
decent
texture
i
really
enjoyed
sly
foxs
interpretation
of
a
rauchbier
im
not
normally
a
fan
but
the
balance
worked
for
me
pours
a
very
dark
amber
with
abt
a
14
inch
pearly
head
smell
is
strong
of
smoke
and
caramel
taste
is
also
heavy
smoke
with
almost
a
beef
jerky
smoked
pepper
taste
finishing
with
dark
fruits
pours
a
cloudy
medium
amber
normal
head
volume
above
average
retention
and
lacing
excellent
nose
of
wood
smoke
with
distinct
cherry
like
sweet
notes
it
lacks
the
meatiness
of
the
aecht
schlenkerla
rauchbiers
and
is
lower
in
intensity
light
medium
body
with
a
somewhat
oily
texture
normal
carbonation
with
a
bit
of
effervescence
in
the
finish
the
flavor
profile
is
outstanding
and
follows
the
nose
in
regard
to
aecht
schlenkerla
rauchbiers
no
meat
less
complex
and
less
intense
it
begins
with
a
burst
of
smoke
over
a
sweet
cherry
note
the
middle
is
a
subtle
bitterness
with
an
ashy
quality
over
caramel
sweetness
the
finish
is
a
slow
fade
of
smoky
sweetness
with
a
slight
alcohol
note
a
very
good
offering
especially
for
style
introduction
purposes
but
not
in
the
same
league
as
aecht
schlenkerla
so
far
im
concerned
aecht
schlenkerla
is
the
epitome
of
rauchbier
most
brewers
and
beer
writers
and
evidently
beer
advocates
agree
so
i
tend
to
base
my
opinions
of
smoked
beers
on
how
they
compare
and
if
i
didnt
know
any
better
id
swear
this
southern
oregon
town
was
actually
part
of
upper
franconia
calderas
rauch
ür
bock
fairs
very
well
indeed
wow
picked
this
up
on
a
whim
from
the
corner
store
and
i
am
super
impressed
its
pretty
much
an
ideal
version
of
the
style
sweet
hickory
roasty
campfire
goodness
reminiscent
of
barbecue
interesting
flavor
and
smell
overall
this
is
a
very
tasty
rauchbier
sweet
malt
and
savory
smoke
play
perfectly
together
right
up
there
with
the
standard
schlenkerla
rauchbier
urbock
glad
to
see
that
rose
petal
mess
wasnt
an
indicator
of
the
rest
of
the
kettle
series
o
i
really
liked
this
rauchbier
as
i
felt
that
the
smoke
was
quite
powerful
but
not
overdone
it
seems
like
it
would
go
well
with
bbq
food
overall
an
excellent
rauch
and
one
of
the
better
nongerman
examples
i
have
had
very
drinkable
the
smokiness
is
tad
diluted
in
the
taste
but
it
is
still
vibrant
enough
to
satisfy
the
cherry
kicks
in
to
balance
everything
off
with
a
modest
bitter
bite
at
the
finish
the
bros
are
right
on
when
thy
give
this
one
a
world
class
rating
this
may
be
the
highest
rating
i
have
ever
given
a
beer
on
beer
advocate

dark

smell
is
of
candied
smoked
ham
mmmm
taste
is
quite
sweet
up
front
and
follows
with
a
tad
bit
of
smoke
extremely
palatable
lovely
actually
very
light
bodied
but
it
doesnt
detract
very
much
recommended
im
a
sucker
for
smoked
beers
this
is
a
good
one
i
actually
want
more
smoke
flavor
but
this
is
a
damn
fine
balanced
beer
and
if
you
like
smoked
beers
especially
in
the
bamburg
vein
definitely
check
this
out
overall
good
beer
and
excellent
representation
of
the
style
surprisingly
wellbalanced
as
even
in
german
versions
of
this
style
the
smokiness
overpowers
almost
everything
else
worth
a
taste
and
a
good
beer
for
a
change
of
pace
oa
pleasantly
surprised
i
didnt
have
high
expectation
for
this
going
into
it
but
im
happy
to
have
tried
it
not
a
style
im
going
to
buy
regularly
but
ill
certainly
return
to
the
style
maybe
to
pair
with
some
vegan
food
d
a
very
well
done
beer
that
is
traditional
like
schlenkerlas
beers
its
hard
to
rate
this
beer
and
thats
because
i
didnt
like
it
i
dont
have
time
to
write
a
full
review
so
i
will
edit
this
later
but
for
those
who
are
interested
this
was
an
intensely
smokey
beer
the
smoke
flavor
was
over
powering
and
i
didnt
enjoy
it
which
is
odd
because
i
would
bathe
in
a
smokehouse
if
i
could
for
some
reason
it
just
didnt
work
for
this
beer
for
me
this
is
not
a
beer
i
can
drink
more
than
a
few
gulps
out
of
the
glass
however
i
did
use
the
rest
of
this
brew
to
cook
with
i
had
made
a
smoked
gouda
and
cheddar
cheese
dip
for
serving
with
soft
pretzels
i
added
the
remainder
of
the
beer
and
it
came
out
fantastic
the
dip
didnt
last
the
first
quarter
of
the
football
game
last
week
this
is
a
very
easydrinking
beer
to
relax
with
given
its
relatively
high
alcohol
it
could
be
dangerous
but
nevertheless
quite
enjoyable
overall
this
beer
paired
excellent
with
the
beef
jerky
i
would
say
that
this
beer
will
pair
great
for
smoked
cookouts
steak
chicken
sausage
this
is
an
excellent
representation
of
the
american
rauch
beer
i
think
caldera
brewing
company
did
an
excellent
job
overall
a
great
rauchbier
but
not
as
good
as
the
originals
from
bamburg
germany
still
this
is
a
great
brew
that
any
beer
advocate
would
enjoy
great
roasted
smokey
flavor
that
pairs
well
with
smoked
foods
and
beef
jerky
i
will
gladly
buy
this
again
as
i
am
a
huge
fan
of
rauchbiers
overall
this
is
fantastic
its
well
balanced
and
has
all
the
great
smoked
qualities
i
love
after
this
beer
i
feel
like
ive
sat
around
a
campfire
an
entire
22
ounce
bottle
might
be
a
bit
much
for
this
flavourful
beer
though
i
would
certainly
have
this
beer
again
i
will
need
to
remind
myself
to
really
take
time
with
it
to
get
a
full
experience
not
many
beers
take
you
in
so
many
directions
as
this
rauchbier
manages
to
do
a
from
the
22
oz
bottle
bought
at
best
damn
in
san
diego
label
says
grains
are
smoked
with
cherry
and
beech
wood
definitely
one
of
the
best
smoked
beers
ive
had
rich
and
sweet
with
a
fragrant
smokiness
o
very
tasty
aromatic
and
allinall
a
good
not
great
highly
drinkable

pours
a
deep
redorange
amber
with
little

and
no
lacing
aroma
of
smoke
and
fruit
strong
smoke
start
with
an
average
lager
body
light
flavors
of
malt
and
fruit
are
overwhelmed
by
smoke
which
leaves
a
chemically
aftertaste
like
burning
electronic
components
i
didnt
really
enjoy
this
beer
im
a
fan
of
smoked
beers
but
the
finish
on
this
one
was
just
way
off
for
my
taste
my
experience
was
so
much
different
from
most
others
that
i
may
have
to
revisit
this
beer
in
the
future
to
see
if
i
got
an
off
bottle
o
im
really
surprised
that
its
not
too
sweet
i
really
like
the
mouthfeel
its
not
too
thick
and
syrupy
to
me
and
the
look
is
welcoming
as
well
the
smell
isnt
incredibly
smokey
nor
is
the
taste
but
its
enough
to
make
you
want
more
for
sure
just
a
great
rauchbier
id
definitely
pick
this
one
up
again
cheers
o
not
bad
at
all
in
fact
pretty
dark
good
it
was
a
bit
warm
i
think
a
few
degrees
colder
would
make
for
an
even
enjoyable
experience
o
one
of
the
more
peculiar
smoked
beers
ive
ever
had
good
but
not
exceptional
pours
a
murky
light
brown
with
a
1
inch
fizzy
tan
head
that
settles
to
a
film
on
the
top
of
the
beer
small
dots
of
lace
slowly
drip
back
into
the
remaining
beer
on
the
drink
down
smell
is
of
smoked
meat
smoked
cheese
campfire
smoke
etc
taste
is
of
smoked
meatcheese
campfire
smoke
wood
and
a
slight
cocoacoffee
flavor
on
the
finish
the
aftertaste
is
also
cocoacoffee
with
just
a
hint
of
the
smoke
flavors
this
beer
has
a
crisp
level
of
carbonation
with
a
bubbly
mouthfeel
overall
this
is
a
very
good
rauchbier
from
caldera
that
has
a
bit
of
a
different
flavor
than
german
rauchbiers
feel
is
standard
smooth
but
went
flat
quite
fast
very
good
example
from
caldera
here
excellent
use
of
the
smoke
with
its
subtleties
a
ruby
pour
with
a
half
finger
off
white
head
opaque
smells
like
bacon
its
so
smoky
very
much
a
wood
smoked
scent
great
on
an
autumn
night
the
flavor
is
full
but
not
overbearing
smoky
with
a
hint
of
sweetness
i
dig
this
a
lot
will
seek
out
other
rauchbiers
for
some
comparison
this
is
delicious
for
the
first
68oz
then
it
gets
to
be
a
little
much
i
imagine
after
having
this
a
few
times
you
appreciate
the
flavors
more
maybe
i
shouldve
picked
a
tamer
rauchbier
to
be
my
first
o
i
had
heard
some
good
things
about
this
beer
and
it
certainly
lived
up
to
my
expectations
its
a
very
well
crafted
beer
where
the
smoke
asserts
itself
but
doesnt
drown
out
everything
else
ill
pick
this
up
again
without
a
doubt
aroma
and
flavor
alone
are
mouthwatering
bravo
more
please
a
flavorful
brew
strong
smokiness
is
tempered
by
the
rich
caramel
malt
qualities
a
real
winner
that
could
bring
the
nonsmoke
lover
around
great
rauchbier
this
was
quite
delicious
the
pour
made
it
seem
a
little
lacking
in
carbonation
and
while
indeed
it
was
light
in
carbonation
i
think
it
would
have
been
awkward
if
it
had
been
heavier
considering
the
taste
profile
this
beer
does
such
a
good
job
of
hitting
the
sweet
and
savory
side
of
smoke
nice
big
campfire
smoke
smell
and
taste
without
any
roughness
to
it
with
a
nice
smoked
bacon
savory
sweetness
this
is
easy
to
drink
and
just
downright
delicious
would
love
to
have
a
keg
of
this
by
my
desk
overall
this
is
a
really
well
made
smoked
lager
the
nose
is
wonderfull
but
the
beer
turns
out
to
be
plenty
drinkable
i
usually
am
a
one
and
done
with
smoked
beers
not
this
one
another
great
offering
from
caldera
best
brew
ive
had
in
a
while
first
ive
had
from
this
brewery
if
their
others
are
even
close
to
as
good
as
this
i
wont
be
disapointed
poured

a
real

smoked
bock
beeri
will
grab
a
few
of
these
this
fall
while
eating
alot
of
smoked
meat
off
my
smoker
o
not
too
complex
because
of
the
intense
smoke
taste
but
it
works
excellent
in
this
beer
i
will
definitely
be
picking
this
up
again
overall
if
you
love
the
idea
of
smoked
anything
actually
you
will
love
this
beer
it
is
hands
down
one
of
the
most
smoky
beers
i
have
had
to
the
point
where
it
almost
looses
balance
like
say
alaskan
smoked
porter
or
ass
kisser
smoked
porter
however
if
you
are
into
smoked
beers
this
one
is
a
must
try
overall
at
some
point
in
trying
this
beer
you
will
say
holy
shit
it
is
unlike
any
any
beer
ive
had
and
any
smoked
beer
for
that
matter
its
very
interesting
but
good
although
it
very
hard
to
drink
alot
of
it
definitely
a
bottleshare
i
could
smell
it
all
day
as
far
as
drinking
it
im
cool
with
1oz
at
a
time
its
that
intense
if
you
like
smoked
beers
then
check
this
out
if
not
stay
away
i
kind
of
like
them
trying
to
get
into
them
more
so
id
try
it
again
next
time
but
for
now
im
not
worthy
a
wonderful
effort
overall
i
wouldnt
go
so
far
as
to
say
world
class
but
the
brew
does
have
a
nice
bit
of
elegance
which
always
gets
more
points
from
me
and
the
smokiness
carries
a
lot
of
power
without
being
too
heavy
overall
its
not
bad
but
as
far
as
a
rauch
feels
like
to
much
of
that
peated
taste
dont
know
if
i
would
pick
it
amongst
other
smoked
beers
if
i
hadnt
stuffed
myself
with
chinese
food
earlier
in
the
night
i
may
have
been
more
tempted
to
overdose
on
rauch
ur
bock
only
kidding
i
have
a
good
idea
when
to
stop
warning
you
may
be
temped
buy
more
bottles
after
you
try
your
first
in
short
superb
dsimply
putoutstanding
quite
possibly
one
of
the
finest
rauch
beers
i
have
had
the
pleasure
of
imbibing
this
is
a
beer
i
wish
i
would
have
tried
sooner
so
i
could
have
gone
out
and
stocked
up
on
well
done
caldera
this
is
a
beer
you
should
be
very
proud
of
overall
a
really
nice
and
interesting
beer
i
saw
this
on
the
shelf
and
hadnt
tried
anything
yet
from
this
brewery
but
looked
interesting
figured
i
would
try
it
it
was
really
a
nice
beer
it
definitely
had
a
lot
of
smoky
and
meaty
flavor
to
it
very
interesting
and
nice
beer
overall
i
would
drink
it
again
a
good
warming
smoky
beer
do
this
oregonbrewed
rauchbeer
develops
some
of
the
most
intense
woodsmoke
essence
encountered
thus
far
but
it
may
be
at
the
expense
of
the
strong
lager
that
is
its
base
deciphels
of
the
imports
from
bamberg
would
find
this

thanks
augustgarage
this
beer
pours
a
dark
amber
color
with
a
perfect
size
head
that
did
dispate
quickly
the
smell
is
strongly
of
malts
and
a
smokyness
the
taste
starts
off
very
malty
smoked
flavors
then
finishs
with
a
smoked
sausage
like
flavor
the
aftertaste
is
strongly
of
a
smoked
meat
and
the
flavor
stays
on
your
palette
for
some
time
also
nicely
carbonated
overall
fantastic
beer
very
odd
but
still
enjoyable
the
smoke
was
pretty
intense
i
enjoyed
it
okay
but
ill
have
to
try
some
other
rauchbier
to
compare
im
not
usually
one
to
say
this
but
its
almost
a
touch
maltforward
not
that
its
a
bad
thing
i
think
this
is
probably
my
favorite
domestically
produced
rauchbier
ive
had
the
pleasure
of
tasting
it
really
hits
on
all
cylinders
a
touch
sweet
and
malt
forward
but
all
in
all
it
does
what
its
going
for
and
works
beautifully
definitely
worth
seeking
out
drinkability
is
really
quite
good
for
such
a
smoke
bomb
no
doubt
inspired
by
aecht
schlenkerla
with
the
body
and
color
of
the
marzen
but
the
punch
of
the
ur
bock
it
one
of
the
best
stateside
examples
of
the
style
which
is
rarely
attempted
and
even
more
rarely
successful
i
have
to
say
this
was
really
good
and
with
just
a
touch
less
phenols
would
be
up
a
notch
easily
it
was
still
a
beer
that
im
glad
i
grabbed
they
dont
make
many
in
the
style
anyways
notes
id
be
interested
to
see
exactly
how
they
brewed
this
beer
the
smoke
seems
more
of
an
extract
additive
than
natural
smoke
a
bit
much
for
me
however
a
12oz
bottle
would
have
been
more
appealing
for
one
sitting
and
it
has
nothing
to
do
with
the
moderate
abv
its
a
rich
sob
great
beer
loads
of
smoke
and
very
authentic
d
a
good
beer
there
are
not
too
many
smoked
beers
made
so
for
that
reason
alone
i
tried
it
well
worth
it
though
it
was
not
my
favorite
smoked
beer
i
found
this
a
little
difficult
to
drink
at
first
due
to
its
uniqueness
but
grew
accustomed
to
the
pungency
this
is
a
nice
sipper
if
given
a
chance
and
im
really
glad
i
tried
it
recommended
i
envy
anyone
who
has
access
to
growlers
of
this
the
drinkability
is
superior
as
well
as
the
flavor
a
a
great
rauchbier
one
i
could
enjoy
frequently
if
it
werent
such
a
large
bottle
the
mid
7
hinders
it
slightly
too
but
this
was
great
to
share
and
i
loved
the
complexity
of
bock
malts
w
smoke
and
smoothness
from
the
lagering
it
is
a
beer
i
would
like
to
see
more
brewers
attempt
this
is
a
good
representative
of
the
style
so
smoky
so
tasty
love
the
different
woods
used
on
the
malt
alcohol
is
clean
and
nearly
hidden
until
halfway
through
the
bottle
a
big
quaff
m
d
body
feels
a
little
lighter
in
the
mouthfeel
but
seems
to
pick
up
a
little
weight
after
going
down
however
little
sense
that
might
make
the
alcohol
content
is
perhaps
a
little
high
but
a
little
slower
sipping
never
hurt
anyone
not
a
bad
take
on
the
style
though
i
think
i
personally
would
have
enjoyed
it
better
if
the
actual
smokiness
were
a
touch
more
robust
a
beer
that
performs
as
advertised
smoke
meat
and
lager
all
in
one
not
really
a
style
i
want
more
than
one
of
but
still
tasty
this
beer
pours
a
very
clear
and
attractive
shade
of
ruby
brown
much
less
dark
than
i
had
anticipated
and
carrying
a
diminutive
but
attractive
head
of
parchment
foam
that
leaves
very
nice
lace
the
smoky
aroma
of
this
beer
is
very
nice
it
smells
like
the
smoke
that
would
waft
from
the
smoker
at
a
little
restaurant
in
my
home
town
of
traverse
city
michigan
porky
sweet
and
delectable
with
notes
of
brown
sugar
i
suddenly
have
a
huge
craving
for
an
all
meat
mess
the
flavor
is
also
quite
nice
in
that
the
smoke
is
not
too
overpowering
other
flavors
include
sweet
dark
malt
brown
sugar
a
bit
of
cinnamon
and
leather
quite
nice
and
well
blended
the
body
is
medium
with
a
mouthfeel
that
seems
a
bit
sticky
but
is
pretty
good
surprisingly
drinkable
and
would
be
great
of
course
with
bbq
not
the
first
smoked
beer
i
have
had
but
the
first
i
have
reviewed
this
one
makes
me
want
to
seek
out
more
d
this
is
the
best
of
the
kettle
series
ive
had
a
very
well
made
rauchbier
in
the
same
league
as
schlenkerla
at
a
cheaper
price
rare
style
too
good
job
caldera
d
despite
a
heavenly
aroma
and
feel
and
good
flavor
this
only
can
muster
a
4
0
simply
due
to
a
hefty
alcohol
girth
its
a
touch
on
the
sweet
side
urbock
but
the
smokiness
is
well
done
sure
its
worth
a
glass
or
two
and
is
one
id
definitely
have
again
maybe
the
one
i
got
was
bad
but
it
tasted
like
sour
cigarette
smoke
i
like
sour
beers
and
i
like
smoked
beers
the
problem
is
this
taste
like
it
shouldnt
be
sour
decent
levels
of
smoke
more
like
cigarettes
than
smoked
food
chili
is
surprisingly
dominant
with
some
whiskey
coming
through
interesting
mix
but
overly
sweet
for
my
taste
pretty
sure
its
liquid
smoke
added
i
hate
that
black
with
low
mocha
head
low
to
average
lacing
the
aroma
is
wood
smoke
also
meaty
aroma
leather
i
dont
feel
chilli
at
all
the
taste
is
also
smokey
leather
soy
sauce
and
sweet
palate
it
thin
low
carbonation
the
beer
is
lighter
than
you
could
expect
due
to
sweet
character
very
drinkable
really
nothing
special
not
the
smokiest
of
beers
rather
light
same
goes
for
the
chili
part
easier
to
drink
but
probably
many
people
will
find
it
lacking
o
first
off
i
dont
know
that
id
call
this
a
rauchbier
id
call
it
a
stout
with
peated
malt
second
if
you
like
scotch
smoke
with
roasty
notes
id
definitely
recommend
it
i
liked
it
a
lot
honestly
my
expecations
are
never
that
high
for
de
molen
the
half
belgian
half
other
style
brews
they
do
are
always
just
a
bit
of
a
miss
for
me
this
one
however
is
a
strong
representation
for
the
style
if
they
could
just
get
that
carbonation
under
control
overall
after
drinking
a
bit
of
this
i
lost
interest
in
it
quickly
not
rich
enough
and
the
chocolate
flavor
dropped
off
o
wow
this
is
an
interesting
beer
to
say
the
least
good
malt
great
smoke
alot
of
earthy
flavors
i
couldnt
drink
alot
of
this
but
it
is
very
enjoyable
and
would
go
so
well
with
a
nice
robust
steak
or
cigar

this
one
pours
a
light
bodied
milk
chocolate
brown
with
a
billowing
three
finger
very
carbonated
and
active
mocha
head
like
most
of
their
12oz
bottles
this
one
appears
to
be
a
little
too
carbonated
the
nose
is
full
of
chile
pepper
leather
and
peat
its
very
intriguing
im
glad
it
holds
its
own
on
the
pepper
front
the
flavors
are
smoky
dry
leathery
has
some
bark
to
it
and
earthy
musty
pepper
its
interesting
its
peaty
the
peaty
characteristic
is
its
greatest
strength
it
drinks
lighter
in
body
than
youd
think
because
of
the
carbonation
its
effervescent
overall
this
was
a
nice
smoked
beer
it
was
pretty
well
balanced
between
the
peat
earth
and
pepper
solid

one
of
the
best
beers
i
have
had
in
last
few
months
smoked
beer
with
chili
peppers
what
could
go
wrong
dark
brown
in
color
with
an
offwhite
head
intensely
smokey
with
lots
of
roasted
malt
mild
char
and
maybe
a
bit
of
dark
chocolate
interesting
the
chili
peppers
arent
all
that
strong
the
smoke
is
just
as
strong
on
the
palate
is
on
the
aroma
a
touch
of
peat
to
go
along
with
all
the
char
and
ash
maybe
even
a
bit
of
glue
a
moderate
spiciness
and
some
burnt
nuts
not
very
pleasant
all
in
all
it
kinda
feels
gimmicky
and
ends
up
being
somewhat
muddy
and
confusing
to
my
palate
atleast
it
does
surprisingly
well
as
a
refreshing
beer
in
the
summer
though
d
neat
but
lots
of
smoke
and
not
as
much

a

example
of

with

however
a
bit
too
phenolic
in
the
aroma
certainly
a
beer
i
am
glad
i
tried
and
a
worthy
adversary
to
other
in
the
style
to
drink
at
cellar
t
with
smoked
meat
looking
at
the
ingredients
list
chilies
whiskey
malts
umm
where
is
this
bouquet
and
flavor
this
is
a
novocaine
dentist
office
trip
mess
i
am
craving
a
schlenkerla
now
this
is
not
good
and
just
makes
me
think
what
the
heck
where
they
thinking
terrible
youve
done
better
i
am
scoring
this
overall
real
low
this
is
no
fun
at
all
and
this
is
one
of
my
favorite
styles
really
dropped
the
ball
here
ok
i
admit
using
a
snifter
on
this
was
a
bit
overkill
but
the
taste
on
this
is
a
real
disaster
o
of
course
a
beer
like
this
wont
please
everyone
but
it
is
worth
a
shot
if
you
like
rauchbiers
overall
i
could
not
drink
more
than
a
bottle
of
this
but
i
must
say
it
definitely
achieves
its
goal
lookswise
this
gives
the
overall
impression
of
a
malted
milk
ball
dark
thick
chocolatey
brown
with
a
big
sandy
beige
head
the
aroma
is
mostly
a
hickorylike
smoke
molasses
bandaids
a
drop
of
honey
and
unfortunately
little
else
however
the
flavor
is
nice
and
has
a
fair
amount
of
nuance
although
its
too
try
and
thin
to
really
savor
lots
of
chocolate
some
whiskylike
smoke
dates
walnuts
and
oak
rich
and
savory
as
for
the
chilli
its
there
but
its
very
very
subtle
at
first
you
just
get
its
flavor
which
integraes
well
with
the
smoke
but
over
time
it
steadily
builds
to
a
satisfying
heat
that
warms
the
whole
mouth
pretty
good
but
imbalanced
and
just
a
little
uninteresting
there
are
similar
and
much
better
beers
available
from
mikkeller
black
isle
and
rogue
o
i
must
say
i
am
impressed
chili
heat
is
dialed
in
the
balance
of
sweet
and
smoke
is
on
point
and
the
mouthfeel
is
excellent
top
notch
rauchbier
overall
this
beer
is
way
too
medicinal
im
really
not
a
fan
and
wouldnt
have
another
as
an
aside
i
enjoyed
half
the
bottle
with
chicken
molé
and
the
combination
was
fabulous
its
funny
i
came
to
the
local
option
looking
to
try
a
different
de
molen
smoked
beer
only
to
find
it
kicked
and
this
one
freshly
tapped
fair
trade
to
me
it
pours
a
dark
blackbrown
topped
by
a
finger
of
creamwhite
foam
the
nose
comprises
campfire
smoked
honeybaked
ham
caramel
and
toffee
this
is
what
im
talkin
bout
right
here
tasty
the
taste
brings
in
more
of
the
same
with
a
lighter
bit
of
toffee
and
more
of
a
beechleaning
smoke
as
opposed
to
the
woodsier
campfire
of
the
smell
still
pretty
tasty
the
body
is
a
light
medium
with
a
very
light
moderate
carbonation
and
a
slick
feel
overall
a
damn
fine
bit
o
smoky
goodness
good
times
o
considering
everything
this
is
a
pretty
nice
rauchbier
complex
o
not
particularly
good
or
memorable
taste
is
too
bland
and
mouthfeel
is
kind
of
a
wreck
on
this
beer
o
drains
were
invented
for
times
like
this
d
its
a
nice
smoked
beer
that
is
hampered
by
a
weak
mouthfeel
id
try
this
again
ontap
if
i
saw
it
at
local
option
or
one
of
the
few
other
bars
that
have
de
molen
kegs
d
alcohol
is
very
well
hidden
very
drinkable
i
had
it
in
a
side
by
side
tasting
with
schlenkerla
rauch
märzen
its
the
same
quality
but
the
rook
vuur
is
so
more
intense
in
many
ways
more
smoke
better
smoke
if
youd
ask
me
as
in
the
side
by
side
schlenkerla
tasted
more
like
an
ashtray
and
the
rook
vuur
like
smoked
sausage
it
has
way
more
body
but
of
course
a
higher
abv
as
well
looked
great
when
down
easy
quite
nice
i
must
say
pretty
good
a
solid
take
on
the
style
perhaps
not
quite
as
balanced
as
schlenkerla
but
wellcrafted
nonetheless
looks
alright
while
the
aroma
and
flavour
are
intensely
smoky
and
woody
hints
of
smoked
meatfish
and
fruitiness
can
be
discerned
decent
body
lingers
long
on
the
palate
tasty
if
youre
a
fan
of
rauchbiers
then
this
is
certainly
worth
sampling
beer
is
medium
to
mediumlight
in
body
with
mediumlow
levels
of
carbonation
intensity
resulting
in
a
smooth
lightly
foamy
and
wellflowing
mouthfeel
closes
dry
with
substantial
stickiness
on
the
palate
and
lips
o
a
fairly
average
beer
personally
i
felt
as
if
the
smoke
was
underdone
and
i
am
not
even
a
fan
of
smoked
beers
but
its
not
as
if
this
beer
had
the
body
to
balance
off
any
more
smoke
its
almost
as
if
this
beer
is
something
akin
to
a
rauchbier
light
poured
into
a
glass
mug
the
beer
pours
dark
caramel
brown
with
a
thin
offwhite
head
and
some
yeast
sediment
the
head
lingers
for
a
long
time
the
beer
is
wonderfully
smoky
with
hints
of
caramel
and
chocolate
theres
some
of
that
breadiness
from
the
smoked
malt
as
well
the
flavor
is
malty
slightly
sweet
and
smoky
the
smokiness
lingers
in
the
mouth
along
with
some
mild
back
end
bitterness
i
get
some
of
those
chocolate
notes
as
well
but
theyre
faint
the
body
is
medium
to
full
with
low
carbonation
the
beer
coats
the
mouth
allowing
for
a
smoky
aftertaste
to
linger
the
beer
is
pretty
easy
to
drink
this
is
an
excellent
beer
its
not
quite
up
there
with
the
german
rauchbiers
but
its
not
far
off
this
was
a
nice
take
on
the
rauchbier
style
it
offers
a
complex
encapsulation
of
the
style
it
has
a
few
rough
edges
toward
the
end
and
the
dry
smokiness
can
be
a
bit
overshadowing
but
its
a
quality
beer
and
i
would
have
it
again
overall
oftentimes
smoked
beers
take
on
a
bandaid
character
but
in
this
case
the
smoke
and
the
caramel
blend
perfectly
bringing
complexity
and
balance
feel
is
a
bit
thin
taste
is
a
bit
more
subdued
light
ash
sweet
char
mellow
whiskey
lingering
barklike
bitterness
odd
twangy
fruit
finish
paired
with
the
thin
beaded
body
the
overeager
start
im
guessing
that
this
one
will
start
turning
sooner
rather
then
later
pours
a
clear
dark
orange
with
a
foamy
tan
head
that
settles
to
a
film

of
the
beer

foamy
curtain
of
lace
coats
the
glass
on
the
drink
down
smell
is
of
smoked
malt
campfire
and
smoked
meats
and
cheeses
taste
is
much
the
same
with
a
slight
adhesive
bandage
flavor
and
a
very
smokey
aftertaste
this
beer
has
a
lower
level
of
carbonation
with
a
slightly
crisp
mouthfeel
overall
this
is
a
good
beer
with
some
nice
aromas
and
flavors
for
the
style
i
get
used
to
the
smoke
after
half
the
glass
but
the
beer
reains
interesting
o
the
review
looks
worse
than
it
really
is
i
do
enjoy
this
beer
and
would
give
it
a
much
better
score
if
it
had
a
more
luxurious
mouthfeel

im
very
impressed
and
will
buy
this
again
poured
a
chestnut
color
with
a
cream
colored
finger
and
a
half
of
frothy
head
aroma
was
nice
with
a
not
overpowering
but
assertive
smokey
malt
aroma
with
some
hints
of
caramel
toffee
and
meatiness
the
charred
smokiness
is
super
assertive
theres
some
nuttiness
and
caramel
with
hints
of
toffee
on
the
finish
much
more
intense
than
the
aroma
the
feel
has
a
quite
creamy
feel
medium
bodied
overall
this
is
quite
nice
its
an
assertive
rauchbier
but
i
like
em
that
way
o
this
has
good
drinkability
it
just
goes
down
really
easy
add
it
has
a
really
nice
flavor
to
it
overall
i
think
this
is
a
really
nice
beer
and
a
good
example
of
the
style
i
really
enjoyed
this
beer
and
i
would
be
happy
to
drink
it
again
i
recommend
checking
it
out
dots
of
white
lace
stick
to
the
glass
of
this
amber
brown
colored
beer
the
nose
brings
out
a
modest
smoke
note
and
cured
meat
also
some
sweet
malt
for
those
afraid
of
a
really
smokey
beer
you
dont
need
to
be
afraid
this
dutch
brew
the
smoke
is
modest
but
a
sweet
smoke
its
almost
like
candied
bacon
more
commonly
found
is
the
marzenlike
maltiness
and
sweetness
fairly
smooth
and
light
medium
bodied
which
helps
make
this
a
pleasant
beer
for
anytime
poured
an
almost
brown
amber
body
w
one
finger
offwhite
head
that
died
slow
on
top
of
a
strong
roasted
malt
aroma
w
some
smokiness
but
a
rather
mild
smokey
aroma
not
overpowering
or
beef
jerkyish
for
a
rauchbier
this
brew
tones
down
the
dry
roasted
malts
in
favor
of
a
slightly
smoother
creamier
version
dont
get
me
wrong
the
smoke
is
there
and
it
is
good
and
i
like
the
sweet
notes
and
a
touch
of
minor
grassy
hops
on
the
finish
for
a
slight
prick
on
the
tongue
but
when
i
think
of
rauchbiers
i
tend
to
think
of
real
dry
and
smokey
average
bodied
bitter
aftertaste
rhubarb
smokiness
full
with
a
long
and
pleasant
bitterness
this
went
great
with
some
smoked
almonds
dutch
cheese
an
prosciutto
light
carbonation
light
mouthfeel
overall
pretty
good
stuff
extremely
well
balanced
o
if
you
love
a
beer
that
is
huge
in
smoke
this
beer
is
awesome
but
missing
on
carbonation
o
a
good
rauchbier
you
get
what
you
pay
for
but
nothing
wowing
here
a
little
one
sided
but
a
good
rauch
massive
thanks
goes
out
to
jeff
and
charles
at
appalachian
vintner
in
asheville
for
giving
me
this
one
on
my
most
recent
visit
thanks

with
a
one
and
a
half
finger
offwhite

that
subsided
to

finger
slowly
maintained
nice
lacing
throughout
the
glass
the
aroma
was
comprised
of
roasted

smoke
and
ham
the
flavor
was
of
sweet
malt
smoke
ham
and
pulled
pork
it
had
a
light
feel
on

with
mild
carbonation
overall
this
was
a
pretty
tasty
brew
massive
amounts
of
smoked
meat
flavors
going
on
in
this
one
honestly
tasted
like
i
was
at
a
bbq
and
has
made
me
one
to
plan
one
for
this
summer
now
reason
being
is
that
i
wish
i
had
some
to
go
with
this
brew
it
will
definitely
be
present
when
i
have
a
bbq
next
time
great
aroma
and
flavor
going
on
in
this
one
a
very
nice
example
of
the
style
and
a
must
try
in
my
opinion
overall
this
is
a
good
but
not
great
rauchbier
it
has
a
good
smokey
flavor
to
it
but
it
isnt
quite
as
bold
as
i
would
like
it
to
be
i
would
drink
this
again
but
i
might
not
buy
it
for
the
price
and
taste
i
probably
wont
get
it
again
but
it
was
certainly
interesting
i
dont
find
it
superdrinkable
but
this
could
be
well
paired
with
food
duck
nice
to
try
but
i
will
not
buy
it
again
mostly
because
of
the
price
it
is
a
nice
one
but
have
a
bamberger
rauch
for
less
money
rather
than
this
pours
a
hazy
thick
mud
brown
with
clear
shades
of
a
nutbrown
too
smells
of
sweet
bocklike
malt
with
some
kind
of
smokish
notes
pleasant
and
pretty
clean
but
too
much
like
a
doppel
bock
the
smoked
malt
comes
through
a
lot
more
in
the
flavor
it
does
come
through
as
strong
as
aecht
schlenkerla
rauchbier
but
perhaps
the
difference
is
what
makes
this
one
nice
but
not
as
good
id
say
this
one
tastes
more
like
smoke
that
meat
that
has
been
smoked
its
not
a
strong
bacon
or
smoked
salmon
flavor
that
makes
the
other
classic
examples
good
but
not
extremely
drinkable
in
high
frequency
i
picked
this
up
at
a
store
in
brooklyn
new
york
pours
a
murky
brown
colour
with
very
thin
head
lots
of
smoke
almost
bacony
i
find
the
flavour
to
have
almost
a
salty
aftertaste
with
the
lingering
bacon
flavour
as
an
aftertaste
medium
bodied
carbonation
kens
bottle
a
decent
enough
smoked
beer
though
not
exceptional
it
is
worth
trying
not
my
favorite
style
or
one
i
am
too
familiar
with
but
ordered
this
up
at
vaandag
in
nyc
it
had
a
dark
amber
color
and
a
faily
unremarkable
aroma
the
taste
and
mouthfeel
was
on
the
money
a
nice
amount
fo
smokiness
which
means
a
subtle
amount
it
was
there
and
noticable
but
mostly
towards
the
end
of
the
palate
a
perfect
amount
to
compliment
a
smokey
food
or
to
contrast
with
something
less
robust
very
creamy
motuhfeel
excellent
a
rather
exceptional
beer
when
it
comes
to
food
accompaniment
with
a
excellenct
balance
of
smoked
malt
and
dark
fruit
qualities
pour
is
cloudy
dark
orangeamber
with
about
two
fingers
of
nearly
white
head
nose
is
plum
black
berry
and
smokey
camp
fire
palate
is
first
off
smokey
as
expected
but
a
dryness
that
is
equal
to
the
citrus
notes
of
the
hops
palate
has
a
meaty
black
currant
to
it
plum
and
blackberries
like
in
the
nose
but
with
a
quality
of
subtle
cherry
yogurt
this
beer
has
not
in
any
way
gone
bad
its
very
subtle
and
it
may
be
because
i
have
it
with
liver
shallots
and
kale
in
balsamic
vinegar
but
it
brought
out
some
fantastic
potential
in
the
range
pours
a
slightly
hazy
amber
color
suspended
sediment
is
present
23
inch
head
of
an
offwhite
color
great
retention
and
decent
lacing
smells
of
sweet
malt
smoke
slight
roasted
malt
hint
of
alcohol
and
an
odd
bacon
grease
aroma
that
is
amazing
fits
the
style
of
a
rauchbier
mouth
feel
is
smooth
and
clean
with
an
average
carbonation
level
tastes
of
smoke
sweet
malt
slight
roasted
malt
hops
hint
of
citrus
and
a
hint
of
yeast
overall
great
aroma
great
body
and
great
blend
pours
a
cloudy
chestnut
brown
with
a
big
thick
frothy
head
that
is
still
around
at
the
very
last
sip
i
got
subdued
aromas
of
woody
smoke
bbq
pork
and
a
bit
of
dark
fruit
flavors
are
much
of
the
same
not
as
smokey
as
i
like
it
but
i
really
like
the
smoke
flavor
thought
that
i
got
more
wood
and
well
seasoned
meat
salty
chinese
bbq
pork
ribs
is
what
i
am
thinking
in
fairness
i
should
mention
that
i
am
drinking
this
with
a
nicely
seasoned
rib
eye
for
dinner
extremely
smooth
and
really
perfect
on
the
palette
excellent
i
would
drink
this
all
night
but
honestly
not
as
flavorful
as
the
schlenkerla
urbier
or
marzen
but
very
nice
still
and
it
is
its
own
beer
over
all
very
nice
and
would
get
again
vdubb
hearkens
back
to
his
familys
roots
with
his
selection
a
continuation
of
the
leaving
falls
church
uberbender
this
conspirator
pours
a
clear
russet
topped
by
a
finger
or
so
of
creamy
ecru
foam
the
nose
is
definitely
dominated
by
charred
smoke
though
some
honeydrizzled
ham
sits
savoringly
in
the
clearaired
background
theres
a
vague
sweetness
in
there
as
well
the
taste
focuses
more
on
the
ham
to
begin
with
a
slice
of
pineapple
laying
on
top
the
smoke
comes
in
near
the
end
diminished
in
strength
since
the
smell
the
body
is
pretty
light
with
a
light
moderate
carbonation
and
a
kinda
crisp
finish
overall
this
is
a
pretty
decent
rauch
though
a
bit
light
on
the
smoke
for
me
still
it
is
very
smooth
and
seems
to
go
down
insanely
easily
md
well
bottleconditioned
the
mouthfeel
is
consistently
mildly
effervescent
and
smooth
against
a
medium
body
all
in
all
i
find
this
belgian
take
on
smoked
beer
a
very
successful
and
succulent
one
coming
with
a
bit
different
complexity
than
the
original
bamberg
stuff
highly
enjoyable
d
the
smoke
has
some
nice
complexity
to
it
and
the
bandaid
note
is
in
the
background
and
not
the
offensive
plastic
taste
but
a
good
cloth
bandaid
note
malt
is
a
bit
buried
but
plays
a
good
supporting
role
tasted
from
10
14oz
bottle
pours
clear
amber
with
a
decent
offwhite
but
quickly
receding
head
the
nose
has
a
hint
of
sweetness
with
hickory
smoke
salty
brine
and
some
lightly
roasted
malt
flavor
is
smoked
hickory
with
smoky
roasted
almonds
and
some
malt
the
body
is
fairly
light
with
average
carbonation
and
a
mediumlength
smoked
finish
d
this
beer
was
relatively
easy
to
drink
although
the
smoked
smell
and
flavor
wasnt
quite
as
intense
as
some
of
the
other
rauchbiers
out
there
a
friend
gave
me
a
growler
of
this
as
a
housewarming
gift
this
was
definitely
among
the
best
smoked
beers
ive
ever
had
poured
into
a
pint
glass
a
cloudy
dark
bronzed
brown
with
a
patchy
offwhite
head
smelled
like
some
kind
of
awesome
barbeque
of
beer
with
the
smokey
aroma
pretty
much
dominating
all
big
taste
of
smoked
meats
heavy
on
the
malts
woody
earthy
with
just
a
hint
of
piney
hops
making
it
through
once
the
smoke
has
mellowed
a
bit
medium
mouthfeel
chewy
lots
of
character
very
drinkable
for
the
style
however
i
really
have
to
be
in
the
mood
for
a
beer
this
smokey
i
like
it
alot
just
have
to
be
in
the
mood
i
had
this
one
at
the
princeton
locaton
on
11908
when
i
was
there
it
was
called
a
rauchbock
with
a
7
3
abv
im
sure
its
the
same
beer
the
color
of
this
beer
was
dark
burgendy
mixed
in
with
some
mahagony
brown
it
had
a
long
lasting
head
of
white
foam
that
left
behind
a
small
white
film
plenty
of
white
foamy
rings
and
quite
a
few
streaks
of
white
lace
it
had
a
heavy
aroma
of
olives
smoke
smoked
wood
peat
and
smoked
meats
the
aroma
was
so
heavy
you
could
just
smell
the
beer
as
they
were
pouring
it
i
thought
that
since
the
aroma
was
strong
the
taste
was
going
to
follow
suit
that
wasnt
the
case
instead
the
taste
had
a
medium
powered
kick
of
smoked
meats
olives
smoked
malts
and
just
plain
and
simple
smoke
it
was
a
medium
bodied
beer
with
a
short
lived
aftertaste
of
smoked
meats
and
smoked
malts
usually
the
aftertaste
of
a
rauchbier
lingers
on
for
quite
a
long
time
but
this
aftertaste
felt
like
it
just
gave
up
i
would
say
that
this
one
is
worth
a
shot
you
usually
dont
find
that
many
rauchbier
brewpub
beers
if
i
saw
it
again
i
would
give
it
another
shot
im
a
big
fan
of
rauchbier
and
this
is
one
of
the
best
ive
had
fantastic
smell
a
smokier
sausageflavor
instead
of
the
usual
baconmaple
bacon
scents
great
taste
as
well
delivering
on
all
the
promise
of
the
smell
while
true
to
the
style
of
beer
a
little
lighter
than
usual
rauchbiers
in
the
mouth
but
that
detracts
only
a
little
from
the
finish
great
effort
and
one
to
seek
out
if
you
like
or
want
to
try
this
style
beer
lightly
crisp
mouthfeel
and
it
finishes
slightly
dry
the
smokiness
lasts
briefly
on
the
tongue
if
this
is
on
tap
when
you
visit
you
must
try
it
only
wish
i
could
have
had
a
slab
of
bbq
ribs
with
this
reccomended
as
this
rauch
can
bridge
the
gap
between
an
intro
for
the
beginner
and
a
tasty
treat
for
the
road
traveled
pro
smell
is
of
smoke
very
strong
even
for
me
with
my
limited
sense
of
smell
taste
is
of
hickory
bacon
and
smoke
not
as
intense
aecht
schlenkerla
rauchbier
marzen
but
that
is
a
very
good
thing
the
smoke
isnt
subtle
either
smooth
and
drinkable
as
all
get
out
the
ba
who
likes
a
good
brown
or
stout
and
has
not
found
a
rauchbier
to
their
liking
would
do
well
to
seek
this
out
wow
they
advertise
that
this
is
brewed
with
99
smoked
malt
but
it
doesnt
come
off
nearly
as
smokey
as
that
suggests
its
clearly
a
beechwood
smoked
malt
and
i
think
theyre
using
weyermanns
but
in
any
case
it
works
its
clear
copper
body
rests
beneath
a
thin
head
of
bright
white
foam
that
drops
shortly
to
just
a
collar
the
nose
is
distinctly
beechwood
smoked
grainy
malt
the
body
is
medium
and
its
crisp
in
the
mouth
with
a
standard
carbonation
the
flavor
is
malty
and
smokey
with
some
floral
and
spicy
hops
and
a
touch
of
sulphur
that
accentuates
its
solid
bitterness
it
finishes
short
and
dry
with
just
a
slight
residual
smokiness
well
done
its
very
enjoyable
on
its
own
and
it
pairs
exceptionally
well
with
most
cheesy
dishes
including
their
grilled
pizza
appetizer
worth
trying
mouthfeel
is
full
bodied
coating
and
probably
well
suited
for
pairing
with
a
chili
this
beer
has
a
pretty
nice
color
to
it
it
was
an
attractive
medium
shade
of
brown
with
a
slight
head
on
it
the
smell
is
quite
smokey
kind
of
overpowers
much
of
the
other
aromas
that
might
be
in
there
the
flavor
is
super
smokey
in
my
opinion
its
just
too
much
for
this
beer
some
smoked
beers
are
really
tasty
if
theyre
gone
right
but
i
just
feel
this
one
was
a
little
overboard
the
mouthfeel
was
pretty
good
too
the
flavor
of
this
beer
just
didnt
do
it
for
me
1209
not
a
bad
beer
this
was
much
better
than
i
had
anticipated
but
im
not
sure
i
would
go
for
it
again
d
pretty
decent
rauchbier
overall
although
it
could
benefit
greatly
from
a
more
robust
mouthfeel
and
more
prominent
hop
presence
however
the
flavor
is
pretty
solid
and
while
it
goes
down
rather
easily
its
not
terribly
memorable
i
should
have
stopped
there
with
just
one
drink
but
its
a
growler
so
i
am
dedicated
to
the
last
glass
the
more
you
drink
this
the
less
enjoyable
it
becomes
had
i
stopped
this
review
after
one
beer
the
rating
would
have
been
higher
but
thats
not
the
case
the
malt
sweetness
gets
to
be
too
overbearing
the
amount
of
malt
sweetness
reminds
me
more
of
a
maibock
than
rauchbier
d
this
one
works
much
like
jolly
scot
the
fuller
malt
profile
and
lightly
smoked
flavor
really
work
kudos
to
abc
for
this
one
d
a
very
easy
drinking
beer
but
i
cannot
really
say
that
this
was
a
very
good
example
of
a
rauchbier
while
the
beer
was
fairly
filling
the
smokiness
needed
more
of
a
presence
in
the
beer
to
be
a
better
rauchbier
the
beer
looked
great
and
had
a
decent
taste
i
would
definitely
recommend
giving
this
brew
a
try
if
it
is
on
draft
i
like
my
rauchbiers
a
tab
bit
more
smokier
than
this
but
its
still
a
very
good
mildly
smoky
rauchbier
i
would
be
happy
to
try
this
beer
again
if
its
still
on
tap
its
worth
a
shot
this
was
definitley
more
bock
than
rauch
but
did
still
possess
enough
smokey
quality
and
crisp
enough
nature
to
keep
things
balanced
and
fairly
interesting
i
didnt
have
too
much
of
a
problem
finishing
my
mug
enjoy
would
have
again
worth
trying
3
75
serving
type
bottle
serving
type
bottle
overall
too
sugary
for
me
to
really
enjoy
it
had
promise
poured
from
the
bottle
into
a
tulip
glass
the
drinker
is
greeted
with
a
moderately
dark
cloudy
cola
brown
hue
with
an
impressive
beige
head
along
with
an
aroma
of
rich
aromatic
campfire
smoke
dried
dark
fruit
raisins
meat
curing
brine
and
associated
spices
hard
to
describe
this
element
it
is
probably
the
product
of
an
association
in
my
mind
and
the
smoky
malt
and
toffee
inviting
on
the
palate
the
smoke
is
refined
yet
assertive
evokes
maple
bacon
or
some
other
sugar
cured
meat
combining
with
some
sweet
flavors
to
remind
me
a
little
of
campfire
marshmallow
i
am
getting
all
kinds
of
cool
stuff
here
raisins
walnuts
and
vanilla
perhaps
a
little
celery
seed
with
the
smoke
building
in
intensity
but
never
reaching
acrid
proportions
body
resembles
that
of
a
wellattenuated
porter
midrange
and
a
little
chewy
with
moderate
carbonation
lifting
up
the
smoke
finishes
quite
sweet
with
little
bitterness
or
roast
great
silky
smooth
cultured
rauchbier
that
comes
pretty
close
to
my
preferred
smokesweet
balance
for
the
style
overall
a
rauchbier
with
good
flavour
elements
however
i
would
have
liked
to
taste
more
smokiness
from
the
malts
the
smoked
meat
spices
was
a
unique
twist
something
i
have
never
drank
before
overall
i
found
this
to
be
a
decent
rauchbier
ive
had
much
better
from
this
brewery
i
liked
the
pull
between
the
woodymeaty
quality
and
its
sweeter
sticky
side
for
the
style
i
love
when
the
bamberg
smoked
malts
are
highlighted
to
the
fullest
degree
where
the
smoky
meaty
woody
quality
is
pungent
rich
and
in
your
face
i
found
this
to
be
the
watered
down
version
of
that
where
drinkability
supersedes
flavour
bottle
poured
a
light
brown
color
beer
with
a
nice
offwhite
foamy
head
with
good
retention
and
some
lacing
aroma
consists
of
medium
smoked
malt
notes
with
some
caramelized
malt
taste
is
a
superb
balanced
between
smoked
malt
with
some
dry
caramelized
sugar
and
just
the
right
amount
of
residual
sugars
body
is
about
full
with
nice
creamy
touch
and
good
carbonation
love
the
balance
in
this
one
with
the
just
about
the
right
amount
of
complexity
i
had
this
the
other
day
at
a
tasting
and
it
smelled
like
shit
well
a
fart
actually
was
the
worst
brew
of
the
evening
its
possible
the
bottle
we
shared
was
a
little
off
wouldnt
be
the
first
time
i
had
a
bad
bottle
from
ltdd
this
time
around
id
say
it
was
a
solid
beer
that
id
drink
again
but
id
be
hesitant
knowing
theres
a
variance
bottle
to
bottle
and
its
not
cheap
mon
dieu
these
rockbandthemed
offerings
just
seem
to
be
getting
better
and
better
remember
though
the
acdc
eurolager
we
started
with
and
this
is
the
cutting
edge
at
the
current
moment
a
stellar
franconian
lager
all
meat
and
smokey
tears
up
front
and
a
more
balanced
crazily
drinkable
affair
thereafter
which
if
it
wasnt
whod
want
anything
to
do
with
that
looking
at
you
fantome
anyways
highly
recommended
even
if
smoke
isnt
your
thing
when
it
comes
to
beer
and
though
i
must
confess
that
im
only
passingly
familiar
with
the
guest
brewer
here
via
the
hockey
song
i
appreciate
the
cancon
all
the
same
light
side
of
medium
higher
carbonation
much
higher
carbonation
than
the
appearance
would
leave
one
to
believe
goes
down
easy
but
you
have
to
like
the
smoke
was
pleasantly
surprised
by
this
compared
to
two
years
ago
reviews
o
ive
really
been
disappointed
with
starr
hills
selection
and
this
did
nothing
to
lift
the
mediocrity
everything
they
brew
feels
unnecessarily
watery
and
tastes
like
not
much
and
this
was
no
exception
pours
a
clear
golden
body
with
creamy
never
say
die
head
that
leaves
lace
as
it
slowly
descends
a
smokey
but
not
too
smokey
i
e
beef
jerky
smell
and
i
can
detect
a
hint
of
sweetness
taste
is
more
of
the
same
as
this
mediumbodied
beer
isnt
as
dry
or
cutting
as
other
smoke
beers
but
has
a
good
smoke
profile
and
also
some
sweet
caramel
and
other
sugary
malts
poke
through
not
as
smokey
as
other
rauchbiers
and
the
profile
of
the
beer
is
a
little
generic
but
overall
i
enjoyed
this
one
o
good
rauchbier
sweeter
than
expected
soft
and
undemanding
the
smoke
is
secondary
but
always
in
the
background
recommended
i
would
drink
again
simply
put
this
is
one
of
the
highlights
on
starr
hills
roster
of
beers
one
dimensional
perhaps
but
it
doesnt
pretend
otherwise
a
good
beer
to
make
a
convert
out
of
your
mainstreambeer
loving
friend
although
you
should
ask
yourself
if
someone
who
loves
mainstream
beer
is
really
your
friend
not
recommendable
for
people
who
dont
like
smokey
flavor
but
if
you
do
youre
in
for
a
treat
overall
beer
is
decent
perhaps
a
little
too
much
smoke
character
with
not
enough
balance
on
the
malt
side
pretty
smooth
a
somewhat
creamy
feel
with
a
medium
body
drinkability
a
very
interesting
beer
but
not
from
a
style
i
care
too
much
for
that
being
said
i
still
enjoyed
this
one
and
would
be
more
than
happy
to
give
it
a
try
again
though
i
fear
availability
will
be
an
issue
alcohol
is
completely
hidden
despite
its
level
a
good
falltime
beer
taste
again
woody
caramel
smoky
like
burnt
mesquite
and
caramelized
campfire
wood
very
mellow
and
pleasant
certainly
a
lovely
brew
faithful
to
style
and
light
enough
to
enjoy
anytime
this
particular
night
rainy
cold
before
a
watter
show
was
perfect
do
overall
just
a
tad
sweeter
than
id
like
from
a
rauchbier
personally
other
than
that
really
no
complaints
this
is
a
beer
i
wouldnt
mind
drinking
in
bunches
on
a
fall
night
comes
off
as
a
milder
rauch
with
some
marzen
character
decent
but
not
really
bringing
the
goods
or
really
interesting
to
me
taste
is
lightly
smoky
nutty
toasted
malt
comes
through
as
well
finishes
dry
and
is
light
to
medium
bodied
with
ample
carbonation
overall
a
nice
easygoing
rauchbier
that
would
be
a
good
intro
for
the
style
pretty
drinkable
and
actually
refreshing
which
is
rare
for
the
style
a
decent
rauchbier
not
overpowered
by
the
smokiness
this
is
pretty
good
its
not
nearly
as
aggressive
and
intense
as
its
bamberg
counterparts
but
its
no
slouch
id
consider
it
to
likely
be
a
more
accessible
entrance
into
rauchbier
this
rauchbier
smoked
beer
type
of
beer
with
a
distinctive
smoke
flavor
imparted
by
using
malted
barley
dried
over
an
open
flame
pours
a
very
dark
drown
with
ruby
highlights
almost
black
in
color
actually
with
a
thin
beige
head
spotty
lacing
was
seen
when
sipped
the
aroma
is
very
pleasant
of
german
roasted
malts
yeast
with
a
light
hint
of
smoke
the
taste
starts
out
a
little
salty
not
overdone
at
all
with
some
dark
bread
with
a
light
hint
of
smoke
that
wasnt
over
done
at
all
very
nice
and
goes
down
very
easy
no
harsh
or
bitter
aftertaste
at
all
perfect
carbonation
and
mediumbodied
never
had
this
style
of
brew
before
and
really
liked
it
have
to
say
i
was
very
impressed
prosit
overall
the
label
describes
this
as
subtlysmoked
and
it
succeeds
there
a
pretty
decent
rauchbier
that
doesnt
overwhelm
and
delivers
some
solid
ol
fashioned
german
lager
flavors
out
of
the
box
nice
this
rauchbier
doesnt
just
rely
on
heavily
smoked
malts
but
has
tasty
hops
and
a
great
munichstyle
helles
malt
sweetness
still
if
you
want
that
rough
barbecue
aftertaste
this
isnt
the
right
beer
for
you
d
looks
and
smells
great
has
a
nice
level
of
smokiness
and
malt
sweetnessbitterness
levels
let
down
by
this
thin
finish
overall
very
drinkable
though
this
is
a
weird
beer
although
im
still
within
the
best
by
date
i
fear
this
bottle
may
be
past
its
prime
drinkability
this
strikes
me
like
a
bit
of
a
smoked
english
pale
ale
combined
with
some
german
ale
characteristics
it
is
different
from
other
rauchbiers
i
have
had
could
have
several

would

not

the

this

find

probably
the
most

ive
ever

after
trying
three
rauchbier
recently
i
really
really
long
to
fly
to

in
the

to
taste
these

not

fizzy
with
a

peaty
and
smoky
with
light

in

and

up

with
an
herbal
hop
bitterness
sneaking
in
quickly
before
subtle
smoked
malts
present
themselves
after
a
few
pulls
the
smokiness
starts
to
linger
and
excite
the
senses
but
never
never
really
kicks
off
light
bodied
and
easy
going
all
the
way
really
digging
the
fact
that
southern
star
tackled
this
oh
too
rare
style
but
this
one
needs
to
grow
some
balls
overall
exceptional
this
is
a
keeper
and
will
be
in
my
fridge
again
way
too
much
carbonation
i
was
burping
all
night
do
the
only
outstanding
flaw
i
see
here
is
southern
stars
rauchbier
is
all
but
one
dimensional
take
a
clean
pilsner
and
throw
in
10
beechwood
smoke
malt
a
good
one
to
introduce
others
to
the
world
of
smoke
thanks
for
the
style
want
kojevergas
overall
a
well
done
beer
not
going
to
have
any
trouble
with
the
squat
1
pt
1
oz
bottle
but
there
isnt
much
of
a
wow
factor
which
again
is
a
nice
execution
of
a
style
that
so
often
goes
overboard
c
this
is
a
medium
to
light
bodied
brew
with
a
crisp
feel
light
yet
enjoyable
smokiness
and
very
enjoyable
without
being
overbearing
smoked
beers
are
not
something
i
crave
and
sit
down
and
plow
through
any
real
quantity
of
however
this
one
i
could
probably
go
back
for
more
decent
attempt
but
not
exceptional
a
few
tweaks
could
make
this
an
outstanding
rauchbier
thanks
to
fatsbelvadere
for
sending
this
in
the
hr
derby
bif
poured
from
the
bottle
into
a
worthy
burger
snifter
smells
like
hot
dogs
a
little
bit
of
pork
also
probably
the
lightest
raunchbier
ive
seen
in
awhile
2
finger
head
dissipated
real
quick
not
digging
the
taste
missing
the
campfire
or
porkbacon
taste
i
love
theres
just
a
weird
acidic
smoke
flavor
disappointing
as
its
hard
to
find
this
style
atmosphere
is
really
nice
bubbly
white
head
lots
of
carbonation
no
lacing
nose
is
malty
and
smoky
not
much
else
light
malt
with
a
nice
hop
all
wrapped
up
in
a
nice
smoky
blanket
overall
this
is
a
good
quaff
pours
an
orange
color
some
clarity
somewhat
hazy
soapy
finger
of
tan
color
dissipated
quickly
the
aroma
was
meaty
with
more
of
a
ham
note
and
a
bit
of
backing
malt
sweetness
not
very
complex
but
pleasant
smoky
notes
on
the
taste
but
ample
malt
sweetness
up
front
that
sort
of
take
away
from
the
smoke
making
the
smoke
a
bit
muddled
body
was
on
the
medium
side
at
best
with
a
slight
prickly
bit
of
carbonation
high
drinkability
but
could
really
use
a
more
smoky
smell
and
flavor
to
make
this
a
real
rauch
treat
worth
trying
though
as
its
not
a
style
that
is
typically
inundated
and
its
more
that
decent
smoke
is
a
little
lighter
on
the
flavor
than
id
hoped
but
it
still
has
some
terrific
smokiness
and
meaty
flavors
the
grain
is
maybe
a
little
too
light
the
mouthfeel
suffers
a
bit
because
of
it
i
fear
this
is
definitely
not
quite
up
to
the
standards
set
by
my
homies
in
bamburg
there
is
not
a
whole
lot
of
complexity
here
but
the
smoke
flavors
are
nice
and
the
beer
maintains
a
clean
graininess
all
the
way
through
i
could
drink
a
lot
of
this
but
not
at
the
price
point
it
is
at
currently
can
this
shit
and
sell
it
for
8
a
fourpack
fine
but
dont
charge
6
a
pint
for
it
poured
into
a
glass
mug
the
beer
pours
hazy
dull
golden
with
a
fizzy
white
head
that
doesnt
dissipate
very
quickly
the
beer
has
the
campfire
smell
with
wood
smoke
and
there
is
some
nice
caramel
malt
sweetness
in
the
nose
as
well
it
reminds
me
of
a
nice
smoked
ham
the
flavor
of
this
beer
takes
me
back
to
aecht
schlenkerla
lagerbier
but
it
isnt
as
clean
and
its
smokier
those
smoky
notes
come
through
strongly
in
the
flavor
and
theres
some
nice
malt
sweetness
too
theres
some
hop
bitterness
in
the
back
end
playing
with
the
smokiness
the
body
is
light
with
moderate
carbonation
the
finish
is
dry
and
the
smokiness
lingers
in
the
mouth
the
drinkability
is
very
high
this
is
a
very
good
beer
a
nice
effort
for
sure
just
not
my
style
pours
a
pale
yellow
cloudy
body
with
a
creamy
white
head
lasting
good
sized
ham
aroma
some
smoke
some
malt
sweet
crisp
taste
smokey
ham
creamy
mouthfeel
clean
aftertaste
a
little
too
much
after
a
while
nice
im
a
fan
of
smoked
malt
in
my
beers
and
this
seemed
pretty
darned
spot
on
for
the
rauchbier
style
i
wish
they
would
can
this
on
a
regular
basis
as
i
would
definitely
trade
for
some
more
pours
a
cloudy
golden
yellow
color
nice
carbonation
nice
little
fizzy
white
head
with
some
sticky
lacing
left
behind
the
nose
is

nice

with
some
spice
the
taste
is
malty
with
some
nice
smokyness
to
it
slight
spice
thrown
in
medium
body
drinkable
i
like
this
one
not
bad
at
all
this
brew
pours
up
a
clear
golden
color
with
a
small
white
head
the
nose
is
straight
smoked
pork
sausage
the
taste
is
very
smokey
smoked
meat
subtle
sweet
malts
faint
hops
medium
bodied
low
carbo
very
smoothe
a
very
sessionable
rauchbier
but
that
raises
the
question
is
it
possible
to
buy
a
sixer
of
a
rauchbier
and
sit
and
enjoy
can
one
person
really
enjoy
drinking
a
light
easy
smoked
porkflavored
beer
as
a
session
i
dunno
this
has
to
be
the
most
odd
beer
that
i
have
ever
tasted
i
passed
it
around
the
table
just
to
see
what
others
thought
i
got
various
descriptions
smoked
salmon
bacon
and
salami
were
the
words
that
they
used
it
smells
like
smoked
meat
it
tastes
like
smoked
meat
this
may
be
the
rauchbier
style
so
if
you
are
looking
for
that
in
your
beer
this
is
the
one
if
not
i
would
look
for
something
else
to
sip
on
very
nicely
done
overall
a
very
good
example
of
the
rauchbier
style
its
good
to
see
a
rauchbier
available
in
texas
i
enjoyed
this
at
the
brewery
for
the
oktoberfest
party
not
bad
at
all
but
i
think
i
need
to
be
more
familiar
with
the
style
i
hope
to
try
some
more
of
this
in
the
near
future
d
ive
only
had
a
few
other
rauchbiers
before
this
one
and
i
must
say
that
it
fits
the
style
good
compared
to
the
others
ive
had
this
is
a
good
beer
to
drink
with
grilled
food
worth
trying
overall
not
bad
but
not
great
ive
had
better
and
worse
rauchbiers
it
brings
plenty
of
smoke
but
not
much
else
i
think
ive
yet
to
have
a
marshall
wharf
beer
that
didnt
impress
the
pants
off
me
and
once
again
i
find
myself
pantless
this
was
a
very
smooth
and
delicious
beer
the
smoke
was
kind
of
in
the
background
and
not
right
in
your
face
very
nice

there

the
smokey

flavors
are

light
especially
after
the
heavy

mostly

the

more
roasted

in

taste
with

happening
but
not
overly
smokey
compared
to
other
rauchbiers
a
bit
of

coming
through
on

medium
bodied
and
pretty
drinkable
if
youre
a
fan
of
the
style
poured
from
the
growler
not
too
much
carbonation
so
no
need
to
be
careful
with
your
pour
this
beer
is
definitely
not
for
everyone
the
main
characteristic
is
certainly
smokey
almost
reminiscent
of
bacon
which
i
dont
mind
at
all
underlying
sweetness
rounds
out
the
taste
definitely
will
try
this
one
again
ordered
this
at
novare
res
but
the
keg
kicked
halfway
into
my
pint
which
the
bartender
kindly
provided
without
charge
had
this
in
a
pint
glass
on
tap
at
novare
res
the
pour
was
decent
the
bartender
said
it
would
take
a
bit
to
settle
and
after
a
couple
pours
then
settles
i
had
a
clear
brown
beer
with
a
small
white
head
no
visible
carbonation
and
my
ability
to
see
right
through
this
beer
really
surprised
me
i
was
expecting
something
a
little
more
heavy
after
looking
at
it
for
a
while
i
stuck
my
nose
right
in
deep
purple
gives
a
faint
smell
of
a
smokehouse
flavor
as
if
i
where
smoking
bacon
not
much
else
to
the
nose
its
really
dominated
by
smoke
not
much
to
taste
in
this
one
a
little
bit
of
the
smokey
bacon
flavor
i
was
expecting
from
the
aroma
but
there
wasnt
enough
of
anything
this
was
really
watery
and
had
zero
carbonation
i
really
felt
like
i
was
drinking
dirty
smoked
water
the
lack
of
carbonation
and
extremely
light
body
give
this
beer
an
off
putting
mouth
feel
this
would
be
easier
to
drink
if
the
flavors
where
more
there
i
just
feel
like
there
wasnt
enough
of
anything
im
really
hoping
my
next
marshall
wharf
endeavor
is
better
i
ended
up
only
drinking
about
a
third
of
this
before
just
calling
it
a
night
i
love
rauchbier
its
one
of
my
favorite
styles
and
this
is
just
really
not
good
screwy
mix
of
flavors
through
a
wet
palate
this
is
almost
as
if
someone
took
flat
homebrew
and
mixed
it
with
nestle
quick
and
served
it
this
i
would
buy
again
and
would
recommend
to
folks
that
appreciate
the
style
o
true
to
style
carbonation
was
a
bit
much
other
than
that
good
beer
drink
not
for
me
i
tried
it
probably
the
worst
rauchbier
i
have
had
poured
from
a
brown
12
oz
bottle
has
a
black
color
with
a
12
inch
head
smell
is
of
roasted
malts
and
smoke
taste
is
roasted
malts
meaty
a
good
bit
of
smokiness
feels
full
bodied
in
the
mouth
and
overall
although
i
am
not
a
huge
fan
of
this
style
this
was
an
enjoyable
beer
overall
a
nice
easy
to
drink
brew
one
that
is
well
worth
trying
color
is
very
dark
brown
almost
black
thinnish
head
goes
down
fairly
quickly
nose
is
very
mild
a
little
sweet
not
especially
indicative
of
the
taste
i
couldnt
really
perceive
any
smoke
in
the
nose
immediately
after
it
was
drawn
and
not
much
after
it
had
stood
a
bit
either
taste
is
nicely
balanced
between
sweet
malt
lightly
bitter
coffee
and
smokey
with
some
meatysavory
character
very
nice
rauch
i
will
certainly
look
forward
to
trying
more
offerings
from
roy
pitz
brewing
if
this
is
an
indication
of
their
beers
cheers
this
is
probably
my
favorite
brew
from
roy
pitz
ive
had
their
fat
daddy
sacks
and
blonde
on
tap
back
in
november
and
wasnt
very
impressed
i
was
convinced
to
take
a
visit
to
their
brewery
after
visiting
my
local
homebrew
show
i
wasnt
disappointed
they
gave
free
samples
of
every
beer
they
had
on
tap
there
quad
was
delicious
as
well
overall
nicel
done
brew
clean
dunkel
flavor
light
smokiness
to
come
through
and
linger
nicely
this
beer
poured
out
as
a
brownish
tone
with
a
white
fizzy
head
on
top
the
smell
of
the
beer
gives
off
a
malty
aroma
with
a
light
smoked
aroma
in
there
too
the
taste
of
the
beer
has
elements
of
smoke
and
lagered
malts
in
there
the
mouthfeel
was
pretty
good
its
got
a
lighter
body
that
remains
drinkable
overall
this
beer
was
decent
its
not
something
id
need
to
have
again
but
its
not
bad
had
this
at
1
draft
night
at
the
shippen
place
hotel
pours
what
appears
to
be
black
in
color
hard
to
tell
for
me
as
i
was
outside
on
the
patio
as
the
sun
went
down
didnt
retain
much
head
however
smelled
mostly
roasty
with
otherwise
a
clean
smelling
aroma
maybe
a
little
coffee
from
the
roasts
but
i
thought
it
was
mostly
subdued
didnt
get
much
smokiness
from
the
malts
i
think
maybe
just
enough
was
added
to
this
beer
to
add
a
little
complexity
but
thats
about
it
tasted
roasty
with
a
light
mouthfeel
would
have
liked
to
see
better
head
retention
but
a
nice
beer
nonetheless
m
the
mouthfeel
is
clean
chewy
with
a
dark
undertone
im
impressed
with
how
well
the
flavors
combine
poured
dark
brown
with
some
deep
chestnut
highlights
minimal
head
retention
very
smoky
in
the
aroma
sort
of
a
sweet
hickory
scent
roasted
and
perfume
notes
as
well
as
a
hint
of
cocoa
and
honey
sweetness
smoke
very
present
on
the
palate
followed
by
slight
tartness
and
a
mildly
bitter
finish
body
is
lightmedium
and
very
creamy
average
drinkability
smokiness
is
a
bit
overpowering
d
i
havent
tried
many
but
this
is
one
of
the
better
rauchbiers
ive
tried
very
nicely
done
serving
type
ontap
d
the
taste
lasts
a
little
too
long
on
the
tongue
almost
a
bothersome
effect
that
detracts
from
an
overall
pretty
good
beer
excellent
drinkability
very
enjoyable
d
ive
never
had
a
rauchbier
beer
before
but
i
was
expecting
more
smoke
flavor
overall
a
solid
offering
i
look
to
try
more
from
the
local
roy
pitz
d
probably
the
best
offering
ive
had
from
roy
pitz
to
date
ludwigs
revenge
boasts
a
wellrounded
mouthfeel
and
pleasant
smoked
flavor
that
left
me
wanting
more
my
first
rp
brew
and
hopefully
not
the
last
dthis
was
quite
a
drinkable
beer
goes
down
easy
and
smooth
dnot
quite
a
traditional
rauchbier
and
not
hefty
enough
to
be
a
smoked
porter
falls
in
between
the
two
maybe
a
smoked
brown
regardless
of
what
it
really
is
it
is
a
winner
i
love
smoked
beers
and
when
done
right
i
become
a
fan
quickly
do
a
great
rauchbier
that
follows
the
guidelines
of
the
style
to
a
tee
the
smokiness
is
kept
in
check
by
the
malts
and
hints
of
hops
if
you
enjoy
rauchbiers
like
i
do
the
drinkability
of
this
brew
if
very
high
well
done
rp
cheers
i
described
it
as
very
pleasant
but
a
little
too
sweet
on
the
bar
napkin
poured
from
tap
into
nonic
pint
at
standard
tap
philly
pours
a
golden
brown
more
brown
than
golden
a
bit
of
head
and
lacing
the
aroma
really
shines
here
lots
of
subtle
smoke
and
sweet
maltiness
not
crazy
but
deff
present
again
the
flavor
is
on
the
more
aggressive
side
of
subtle
with
the
smoke
perfect
amount
for
me
with
a
nice
sweet
malt
balance
easy
easy
easy
drinker
and
very
pleasant
i
have
been
drinking
some
really
nice
rauchs
lately
a
lot
with
the
subtleness
of
smoke
and
bacon
which
i
really
prefer
and
this
one
really
hits
the
mark
for
me
overall
a
great
rauchbier
for
this
who
like
the
subtle
smoke
without
the
bacon
this
poured
out
as
a
clear
looking
copper
color
with
a
white
head
on
top
that
faded
pretty
fast
there
wasnt
any
retention
or
lacing
on
this
one
the
smell
of
the
beer
is
definitely
smoked
its
not
overwhelming
but
you
can
tell
what
style
theyre
going
for
here
the
taste
of
the
beer
is
smokey
as
well
with
a
bit
of
caramel
in
the
finish
the
mouthfeel
of
the
beer
is
light
to
medium
bodied
with
a
light
carbonation
overall
this
beer
was
average
to
me
this
one
makes
me
long
for
fall
sitting
out
back
by
a
campfire
and
was
a
fantastic
pairing
to
a
chunky
prime
rib
hoagie
earlier
medium
bodied
with
a
good
balance
of
smokey
and
sweet
malt
notes
like
the
nose
the
flavor
of
this
beer
consisted
mostly
of
the
sweeter
characteristics
until
it
warmed
up
after
about
ten
minutes
the
smoked
malt
flavors
began
to
appear
with
hints
of
charcoal
bbq
bacon
and
burnt
toast
this
is
nicely
balanced
by
hints
of
caramel
toffee
hazelnut
rye
and
a
touch
of
dry
earthy
hops
complex
but
not
overly
smokey
making
it
relatively
easy
to
drink
a
good
introdction
to
the
style
taste
solid
and
crisp
not
to
heavy
on
the
tongue
no
lingering
after
taste
i
drink
this
baby
all
night
its
like
drinking
liquid
bacon
d
not
my
thing
really
i
wouldnt
go
seeking
out
this
beer
but
it
may
be
worth
a
shot
to
some
if
rauchbier
is
your
thing
di
had
this
beer
before
it
won
the
2008
gabf
gold
and
i
stated
this
is
without
question
the
best
nongerman
rauchbier
i
have
ever
had
glad
to
see
the
judges
agreed
with
me
for
me
a
smoked
beer
geek
this
is
about
as
good
as
it
gets
no
wonder
i
had
something
like
four
in
a
row
d
a
nice
mouthfeel
and
taste
combination
a
pretty
good
smokebeer
that
was
pretty
drinkable
overall
an
easy
drinking
smoked
beer
paired
well
with
my
bacon
apple
red
onion
and
cheddar
melt
d
very
drinkable
this
was
a
perfect
accompaniment
to
some
pretzels
and
spicy
mustard
the
sly
fox
rauchbier
delivers
a
deep
copper
body
beneath
a
short
but
creamy
head
of
ivory
froth
the
retention
is
fairly
good
and
it
leaves
some
nice
lace
about
the
glass
the
body
is
medium
and
combines
with
a
finebubbled
median
carbonation
to
give
it
a
lightly
crisp
and
then
somewhat
creamy
mouthfeel
theres
little
smoke
in
the
nose
but
much
more
in
the
flavor
the
maltiness
is
rich
and
round
as
well
lightly
sweet
and
velvety
on
the
tongue
its
very
much
like
a
vienna
lager
done
with
smoked
malt
the
gently
sweet
and
lightly
toasty
malts
combine
seamlessly
with
the
smokiness
and
its
backed
by
a
firm
bitterness
unlike
many
examples
of
the
style
i
think
this
one
really
nails
the
smoke
level
properly
lending
it
enough
character
to
keep
it
interesting
without
letting
the
smoke
building
on
the
palate
very
well
balanced
well
done
this
had
a
medium
offwhite
head
with
decent
if
not
great
retention
the
color
was
a
clear
deep
amber
with
a
hugely
smoky
nose
the
beginning
struck
me
as
imparting
a
slight
honey
taste
which
gave
way
to
a
sausagelike
flavor
on
the
palate
the
mouthfeel
was
full
not
quite
creamy
the
finish
was
more
towards
porkbacon
if
one
is
capable
of
making
that
kind
of
subtle
distinction
i
was
so
taken
with
this
that
i
put
my
where
my
mouth
and
pen
were
and
sprung
for
a
growler
this
will
be
part
of
an
upcoming
smoke
em
if
you
got
em
dinner
at
my
uncles
place
absolutely
yummy
but
a
steady
diet
of
it
might
put
me
off
so
no
5
for
drinkability
this
is
a
very
nice
smoke
beer
the
smoke
is
not
over
bearing
like
some
smoke
beers
ive
had
it
is
nice
and
smooth
poured
from
tap
into
pint
glass
at
bulldog
midcity
pours
a
slight
brown
color
with
slight
foamy
head
some
smokeybacon
aromas
with
sweet
malts
taste
is
really
nice
smokey
and
bacon
mixed
with
great
sweet
malts
it
super
well
balanced
and
not
so
harsh
maybe
my
fav
smoked
brew
i
ever
had
and
i
usually
dont
like
smoked
brews
overall
nice
brew
and
great
rauch
brew
this
beer
is
smooth
and
easy
to
drink
its
not
much
of
a
rauchbier
but
its
ok
for
what
it
is
i
am
not
a
fan
of
rauchbiers
but
this
is
excellent
plenty
of
smoke
but
incredible
balance
well
done
and
highly
recommended
smoky
mary
isnt
a
terribly
complicated
brew
but
is
definitely
a
solid
offering
from
nola
overall
so
far
my
favorite
from
the
nola
folks
very
sessionable
perfect
for
a
fall
weekend
when
da
saints
and
dem
tigers
chug
down
victories
had
a
pint
a
ny
pizza
on
magazine
st
in
new
orleans
i
had
the
odd
urge
to
eat
this
beer
the
mix
of
spice
and
smoke
with
toasty
malt
and
caramel
reminds
me
of
food
or
at
least
itd
make
a
great
pairing
with
anything
spicy
this
is
surprisingly
complex
for
an
amber
or
smoked
ale
with
a
great
balance
between
the
smoke
and
malt
find
this
beer
outstanding
with
a
burger
nice
but
too
subtle
to
call
it
smoked
overall
once
again
nola
brewing
continues
to
amaze
with
their
specialty
beers
would
love
to
see
this
one
in
22oz
bottles
the
cap
popped
off
without
any
untoward
events
and
i
was
sort
of
gentle
on
my
pour
this
still
created
threeplus
fingers
of
rocky
bonewhite
head
with
moderate
retention
color
was
a
goldenamber
srm
5
i
usually
dont
pair
beer
with
food
but
since
were
doing
the
smoked
thing
here
i
think
this
would
pair
beautifully
with
smoked
salmon
add
goat
cheese
and
a
crostini
and
voila
barbecue
or
other
smoked
meats
would
be
great
as
well
better
than
your
average
turkish
beer
but
id
be
really
curious
to
see
what
they
were
thinking
when
they
put
this
together
this
poured
out
as
a
copper
colored
beer
with
not
a
lot
of
head
on
it
the
aroma
was
very
mostly
like
any
other
lager
other
there
with
just
a
little
bit
of
a
smoked
smell
to
it
the
flavor
of
this
beer
is
of
malts
and
some
hops
nothing
outstand
really
the
aftertaste
gives
off
a
little
salty
smokiness
the
mouthfeel
is
pretty
light
and
not
very
complex
to
sat
the
least
this
brew
overall
isnt
that
great
of
a
smoked
beer
i
suppose
if
youre
new
to
the
whole
thing
you
can
try
it
and
see
what
you
think
nasty
diacetyl
gross
movie
popcorn
type
of
diacetyl
it
takes
over
all
flavors
and
the
finish
is
thick
and
narsty
no
smoke
i
dont
know
what
this
is
this
is
close
to
undrinkable
pours
a
light
brown
with
average
head
smells
very
sweet
with
a
hint
of
smoke
aroma
but
when
you
taste
it
wow
overpowering
smoke
flavor
it
almost
has
a
flavor
of
burnt
wood
even
giving
the
impression
of
an
old
campfire
mouthfeel
is
average
drinkability
not
really
high
but
its
excellent
in
cooking
easily
imparts
a
good
smoked
flavor
to
dishes
that
wouldnt
normally
be
amenable
to
smoking
maybe
not
great
to
drink
but
a
decent
cooking
beer
i
imagine
that
this
might
be
a
decent
rauchbier
but
it
doesnt
appeal
to
me
i
find
the
smoke
on
the
tongue
to
be
a
tad
too
strong
particularly
because
of
the
lighter
malts
no
notable
hop
thin
body
but
appropriately
so
drinkability
despite
being
a
wretched
example
of
a
rauchbier
it
is
somewhat
drinkable
not
quite
a
drain
pour
d
smelled
like
bbq
but
taste
like
potato
very
weird
not
recommended
very
strange
brew
d
not
a
big
fan
of
this
one
i
have
no
idea
what
you
would
serve
or
eat
this
with
hard
to
finish
the
bottle
this
is
very
deceiving
smell
great
but
thats
about
it
d
the
diacetyl
in
this
beer
is
way
too
much
for
being
acceptable
that
aside
this
is
just
an
average
lager
with
a
hint
of
smoke
i
really
wanted
to
like
this
beer
too
as
im
partial
to
smoked
beers
but
this
just
doesnt
fit
the
bill
recipe
or
brewing
practice
spend
your
money
elsewhere
but
not
on
a
bmc
if
youre
interested
in
turkish
beer
check
out
efes
d
an
unsuccessful
copy
of
german
rauchbier
does
not
have
the
full
body
and
taste
of
the
real
stuff
not
necessarily
a
bad
beer
the
quality
is
not
below
average
but
even
the
abv
4
5
tells
that
this
beer
is
too
light
to
be
a
rauchbier
overall
we
thought
this
brew
to
encompass
typical
characteristics
of
any
rauchbier
and
ultimately
found
it
to
be
an
interesting
find
our
favorite
part
about
it
was
the
creamy
slurpiness
lent
by
the
carbonation
and
the
billowy
head
overall
at
first
taste
this
beer
seemed
subdued
but
as
the
ale
warmed
the
flavor
greatly
expanded
great
smoke
presence
and
good
malt
balance
the
malt
flavors
are
neutralized
by
the
smoke
but
the
flavors
compliment
another
very
nice
maine
beer
the
taste
is
a
lot
like
smoked
cheddar
cheese
the
smokiness
does
not
meld
as
well
with
the
malts
but
instead
it
has
a
kind
of
buttery
flavor
and
a
lightly
mild
bitterness
at
the
end
smoked
beers
are
high
on
my
style
list
and
this
one
has
some
good
points
but
not
quite
to
the
level
i
would
have
hoped
poured
into
a
dogfish

a
dark

with
a

and
campfire
smoke
flavor
of
charred

light
caramel
malt
smokehouse
faint
dark
fruit
that
is
hard
to
detect
under
the
smokiness
light
bodied
with
peppery
active
carbonation
an
interesting
rauchbier
but
has
a
fairly
light
malt
bill
and
little
flavor
other
than
the
smokiness
the
smoke
is
nice
and
tastes
natural
but
could
use
some
other
interesting
flavors
to
support
it
in
the
background
the
carbonation
in
this
bottle
was
a
little
overachieving
and
distracted
from
the
light
flavors
glad
i
tried
it
but
probably
would
not
repeat
a
lightduty
smoked
beer
with
very
mild
smoke
m
rich
and
malty
mouthfeel
overall
though
this
is
a
pretty
darn
good
example
of
the
style
cant
think
of
too
many
other
american
made
rauchs
that
are
this
good
or
close
to
the
german
textbook
greatness
producers
schlenkerla
i
could
have
this
anytime
worth
drinking
again
smoky
smoky
smoky
beautiful
dark
color
and
woodsmoke
aroma
this
is
an
intense
beer
it
tastes
like
your
clothes
smell
after
a
campfire
thats
part
good
and
part
bad
for
uniqueness
i
give
it
a
5
but
for
drinkability
i
give
it
a
2
i
split
a
bomber
with
2
other
people
and
that
was
plenty
to
get
the
full
flavor
of
this
old
german
style
beer
its
a
beer
i
will
be
talking
about
for
awhile
but
i
dont
know
how
often
i
will
drink
it
solid
delivery
of
smoked
malt
flavors
but
lacks
depth
the
mouthfeel
leaves
me
asking
for
more
decent
kind
of
interesting
flavor
profile
some
smokiness
there
but
felt
a
little
weak
overall
will
pour
a
five
finger
cream
head
that
fades
slowly
leaving
a
good
lace
cloudy
dirty

color
strong
carbonation
and

for
a
22oz
bottle
from
tullys
beer
wine
wells
me
poured
ontap
and
served
in
a
tumbler
pint
the
beer
is
a
rubyauburn
coloring
with
a
beige
head
that
quickly
settles
into
a
filmy
ring
aroma
is
rich
and
meaty
with
a
solid
charcoal
smoke
character
the
flavors
are
roasted
with
a
nutty
and
caramel
sweet
backbone
carbonation
keeps
the
body
lighter
than
most
rauchbiers
the
aftertaste
is
smokey
with
a
dark
nutty
sweetness
underlying
smooth
finish
seals
up
a
solid
brew
this
beer
was
underwhelming
to
me
it
didnt
have
those
nice
rauchbier
characteristics
dark
brown
with
a
soft
white
head
aromas
of
beechwood
smoke
rich
malt
clean
lager
yeast
and
sweet

with
some
subtle

spicy
smoky
flavorrich
german
malt
sweetness
and
a
touch
of
salted
caramel
medium
crisp
and
clean
with
some
finishing
lager
yeast
pretty
enjoyable
and
easy
to
drink
amply
smoky
perhaps
a
touch
simplistic
but
it
is
exactly
what
i
was
hoping
for
when
i
ordered
this
you
will
of
course
have
to
really
like
smoked
beers
to
like
this
and
i
really
like
that
they
stayed
away
from
the
alternate
smoked
malts
so
many
of
the
newer
and
peat
too
smoked
malts
get
harsh
and
weird
tasting
nice
smokey
sweet
malt
aromas
and
taste
is
similar
a
bit
over
malty
but
easy
drinker
nice
mild
smoked
brew
and
a
borderline
session
its
so
easy
nice
but
not
amazing
very
drinkable
goes
through
an
enjoyable
flavor
progression
i
have
not
had
too
many
rauchbiers
but
this
may
be
the
best
that
i
have
sampled
so
far
mouthfeel
and
drinkability
easygoing
on
the
palate
allinall
a
lightbodied
lightly
spiced
smoked
lager
quite
sessionable
with
a
bit
of
fruity
sweetness
on
the
finish
pours
a
clear
dark
brown
with
a
beige
head
that
settles
to
a
film
on
top
of
the
beer
a
foamy
curtain
of
lace
coats
the
glass
on
the
drink
down
smell
is
of
malt
caramel
and
some
slight
smoke
aromas
taste
is
much
the
same
with
a
light
smoke
flavor
that
lingers
on
the
finish
this
beer
has
a
lower
level
of
carbonation
with
a
slightly
crisp
mouthfeel
overall
this
is
a
pretty
good
beer
but
the
smoke
is
very
mild
in
the
aroma
and
taste
thankfully
the
smokiness
is
more
evident
in
the
flavor
than
the
aroma
nice
balanced
of
smoke
and
sweet
malt
notes
with
hints
of
charcoal
ash
and
smokes
meat
followed
by
caramel
and
toffee
smokiness
nicely
integrated
throughout
but
never
becomes
a
smoke
bomb
i
generally
like
more
smoke
but
this
i
see
is
well
balanced
easy
to
drink
and
flavorful
ive
not
had
many
rauchbiers
before
but
this
one
seems
a
bit
sweeter
certainly
an
interesting
beer
to
try
i
enjoyed
it
but
i
wouldve
preferred
a
halfpint
just
a
tang
of
acidity
pleasant
nose
with
a
whiff
of
the
campfire
in
the
tulip
glass
at
tiger
tiger
in
san
diego
where
abv
is
listed
at
7
3
ive
also
seen
5
9
6
0
6
6
so
maybe
nobody
knows
overall
i
really
enjoyed
this
the
smoke
isnt
nearly
as
intense
as
other
rauchbiers
ive
had
aecht
schlenkerlas
for
example
but
the
balance
of
complex
malt
and
beechwood
smoke
makes
for
an
enjoyable
and
very
drinkable
beer
recommended
o
for
a
rauchbier
i
thought
this
was
pretty
enjoyable
nice
depth
of
flavor
to
it
an
average
rauchbier
a
bit
too
sweet
you
would
think
the
smoke
would
bring
an
earthy
quality
but
no
i
do
think
that
the
smoke
is
approriate
for
the
body
the
body
is
light
and
so
is
the
smoke
it
does
drink
fairly
well
o
overall
a
little
toned
down
wish
it
had
more
of
a
robust
taste
on
tap
from
the
brewery
at
old
grove
drink
it
was
hard
to
finish
there
are
other
smoked
beers
a
lot
worse
and
i
am
sure
better
this
was
right
down
the
middle
for
me
this
smoked
lager
is
actually
not
too
bad
the
smokiness
actually
give
off
some
kind
of
sweetness
instead
of
a
saltiness
like
some
smoked
beers
do
the
smoke
is
light
enough
that
its
doesnt
over
power
the
beer
either
the
color
is
a
copper
with
a
pretty
nice
head
on
it
the
taste
doesnt
scream
bacon
which
is
pretty
nice
for
a
change
the
beer
has
a
medium
mouthfeel
that
allows
the
drinkability
to
increase
not
a
bad
brew
but
it
could
be
a
little
stronger
medium
body
mellow
carbonation
sticky
and
dry
nice
flavor
and
use
of
smoke
not
overpowering
and
pretty
smooth
overall
solid
all
around
beer
order
a
pint
with
food
if
you
can
find
it
poured
brown
with
maroon
highlights
that
had
a
finger
of
head
and
left
good
sticky
lacing
i
really
enjoy
smoke
beers
like
this
which
had
a
great
smokey
aroma
with
roasty
malts
faint
caramel
and
crazy
barbeque
notes
that
were
like
throwing
meat
on
the
grill
very
intresting
upfront
the
smokiness
also
dominated
the
taste
that
had
roasted
malts
caramel
and
barbequed
meat
accents
there
was
also
very
faint
hop
characters
which
popped
up
in
the
background
the
beer
was
medium
body
with
a
good
amount
of
carbonation
that
had
a
real
big
smokey
meaty
and
chewy
finish
overall
the
brew
drank
quite
well
for
me
and
was
really
enjoyable
i
do
like
smoke
beers
and
this
one
was
no
exception
great
offering
from
ballast
point
that
was
out
of
the
ordinary
good
job
overall
not
bad
but
it
could
have
been
better
still
very
enjoyable
and
a
nice
change
to
see
the
style
on
tap
poured
into
a
standard
pint
glass
a
deep
reddish
brown
with
a
minmal
headaromas
were
very
lightfaint
caramel
and
even
more
faint
smoke
are
all
i
really
picked
up
flavors
are
still
light
on
the
smoke
but
there
is
some
good
maltly
sweetnes
to
itbrown
sugar
and
some
modest
roast
flavorsa
light
drying
almost
earthy
finish
not
bad
but
not
one
of
the
higher
end
of
the
style
in
my
modest
opinion
clear
clean
dark
brown
color
with
some
reddish
tinges
along
the
sides
and
a
good
white
head
on
the
nose
i
get
mostly
peat
smoke
along
with
some
roasted
nuts
but
mostly
smoke
intense
peat
smoke
dominates
on
the
palate
as
well
hiding
a
nice
caramel
malt
sweetness
that
lies
beneath
the
surface
a
noble
interesting
and
ultimately
nice
effort
but
i
know
one
was
more
than
enough
quite
drinkable
pairs
well
with
food
on
the
other
hand
i
would
prefer
something
more
potent
a
smoked
lager
maybe
but
a
rauchbier
im
not
so
sure
dvery
good
rauchbier
would
be
great
with
bbq
i
think
this
would
be
a
nice
beer
to
introduce
rauchbier
would
drink
again
d
this
was
a
fairly
tasty
brew
good
pairing
with
bbq
as
it
isnt
too
filling
if
there
is
a
style
secondary
to
american
ipas
and
czech
pilseners
for
me
it
is
rauchbier
this
was
presented
to
me
with
a
finger
of
tawny
head
erupting
with
co2
bubbles
and
evincing
good
retention
nose
had
a
slightly
smoky
sweetness
like
a
mild
bbq
sauce
color
was
a
deep
reddishamber
with
nequality
clarity
mouthfeel
was
mediumtofull
with
a
good
deal
of
smoke
on
the
tongue
warming
the
malt
became
a
bit
more
forward
making
it
taste
like
hickory
or
maple
woodsmoke
cured
bacon
the
finish
filled
my
sinuses
with
that
baconlike
flavor
i
found
it
pleasant
but
it
may
not
be
for
everyone
this
would
be
outstanding
with
bbq
ribs
no
doubt
on
tap
at
hamiltons
and
looked
like
an
amber
color
but
it
was
so
dark
in
there
i
could
not
be
sure
the
smell
was
a
little
odd
but
the
taste
was
something
else
it
smelled
a
little
smoky
which
was
fine
but
then
the
flavor
was
like
wet
dog
and
smoke
it
was
like
somebody
soaked
a
dog
in
lager
and
then
squeezed
it
into
my
glass
yuck
i
drank
it
anyway
ontap
at
tap
and
table
in
emmaus
pa
for
6pint
i
thought
this
was
a
wonderfully
balanced
smoked
beer
it
appeared
a
slightly
hazy
brown
with
no
head
the
aroma
was
a
bit
simple
with
liquid
smoke
but
the
flavor
was
a
tasty
mix
of
molasses
milk
chocolate
bacon
yum
caramel
and
toffee
the
aftertaste
is
a
bit
thin
but
the
basic
profile
is
delicious
definitely
worth
a
try
if
you
a
smokey
but
not
allsmoke
beer
d
nice
smoked
beer
thats
not
too
meaty
or
overwhelming
at
all
i
found
this
to
be
quite
drinkable
overall
as
ive
slowly
been
getting
more
into
this
style
lately
d
a
bit
above
sessionable
but
i
would
not
go
for
another
because
smoked
beers
are
not
my
thing
although
this
was
the
most
drinkable
one
ive
had
yet
glad
i
tried
it
out
not
sure
if
its
bottled
another
fine
beer
from
this
impressive
southern
california
brewery
my
girlfriend
tried
a
bit
and
declared
it
bitter
bacon
water
that
goes
down
smooth
d
good
for
drinking
with
some
tasty
bbq
i
couldnt
really
see
myself
just
having
one
of
these
alone
though
its
a
dark
lager
with
a
brownorange
hue
and
very
little
head
that
somehow
fades
to
less
head
no
matter
if
its
a
good
beer
it
will
taste
good
right
smell
is
smokey
like
smoked
ham
and
charred
toffee
or
caramel
taste
is
crisp
caramel
that
fades
to
toasty
toffee
finally
finishing
with
a
strong
deep
smoke
malt
quite
a
lot
of
taste
it
finally
finishes
in
a
long
barleysmoke
aftertaste
warms
to
even
more
smoke
great
smoked
lager
pours
clear
copper
with
a
small
ring
of
offwhite
bubbles
light
aroma
of
smoked
corn
taste
is
weak
until
the
beer
warms
once
it
does
it
is
a
pleasant
smoked
malt
with
some
meatbacon
flavors
a
little
iron
good
but
i
just
want
more
smoke
in
my
smoked
beer
on
tap
at
toronado
san
diego
not
exactly
what
i
expected
with
a
name
like
abandon
ship
i
thought
it
would
be
richer
and
fuller
but
i
guess
i
should
never
judge
a
beer
by
its
name
its
a
dark
amberredchestnut
in
color
beneath
an
offwhite
head
head
retention
and
lacing
are
limited
the
aroma
is
clearly
smoky
but
it
doesnt
beat
you
over
the
head
its
baconwoodbbq
over
a
moderately
caramelish
malt
base
the
smokiness
is
probably
from
beechwood
but
i
cant
be
certain
the
flavor
is
pretty
much
as
the
nose
suggests
with
the
addition
of
a
hint
of
roastiness
and
some
mild
grassy
hops
the
bitterness
is
balancing
and
the
smokiness
does
the
rest
its
mediumlight
in
body
and
moderately
carbonated
overall
its
a
fairly
drinkable
pint
but
i
dont
think
that
theres
enough
malt
there
to
sustain
the
smokiness
for
more
than
one
or
two
its
interesting
though
in
that
its
fairly
restrained
and
that
makes
it
pretty
unique
thin
mouthfeel
didnt
want
to
finish
my
glass
d
a
tasty
drinkable
rauchbier
went
well
with
my
bbq
brisket
sandwich
an
interesting
offering
from
ballast
point
definitely
worth
a
try
never
heard
of
this
ballast
point
brew
and
it
sparked
my
curiousity
so
this
was
the
first
thing
i
ordered
that
day
not
of
their
best
brews
but
definitely
a
unique
one
would
drink
again
recommended
drinkability
is
moderate
low
alcohol
presence
this
is
an
effervescent
smokey
beer
that
is
a
lighter
version
of
heavier
rauchbiers
good
balance
but
i
wouldnt
drink
a
large
amount
of
this
one
d
this
is
not
my
favorite
style
of
beer
but
definetly
an
interesting
offer
from
bp
pours
a
clear
dark
brown
with
a
white
head
aroma
of
smoked
meat
and
peat
flavor
of
salty
smoked
meats
although
it
gets
sweeter
as
you
taste
the
taste
has
modest
levels
of
malt
and
a
bit
of
chocolate
here
and
there
a
pretty
decent
smoked
beer
and
certainly
sweet

and

to

theres
a

more
going
on
in
the

some

and
mildly
acidic
but
theres
still
some
smokiness
very
dry
medium
bodied
with
lowish
carbonation
fairly
enjoyable
especially
for
a
style
im
not
partial
to
its
probably
the
maltiness
that
i
find
most
appealing
from
the
tap
at
the
brewery
poured
a
deep
mahogany
aroma
light
smoke
maltssweet
chocolate
pears
apples

hints
of

and
pears
this
is
the
2nd
smoked
beer
i
have
had
and
i
liked
this
one
the
mouth
fel
was
a
little
thin
i
asked
the
bartender
for
something
different
that
i
have
never
had
their
smoked
beer
is
what
i
recieved
he
described
it
was
liquid
sausage
reddish
brown
in
color
with
a
tan
head
that
sat
atop
the
brew
but
not
for
long
aroma
was
of
roasted
malts
and
a
faint
whif
of
that
liquid
sausage
taste
was
of
lightly
roasted
coffeebeans
toffee
but
not
a
whole
lot
of
the
smoked
flavor
i
was
expecting
it
was
there
it
just
wasnt
the
dominant
flavoring
mouthfeel
was
somehwere
between
medium
and
thick
a
good
beer
a
different
beer
but
not
what
i
expected
ill
have
to
try
other
samples
of
smoked
beer
before
i
say
this
was
an
inadequete
example
enjoyed
the
experience
made
with
10
smoked
barley
could
have
fooled
me
i
agree
with
trbeer
that
this
beer
is
ok
its
just
not
a
rauchbier
its
not
even
remotely
close
the
brewers
either
1
have
never
had
kaiserdom
rauchbier
before
or
2
dont
want
to
lose
money
on
a
beer
that
most
people
would
consider
undrinkable
with
that
in
mind
this
brew
looked
nice
clear
chestnut
to
mahogany
in
color
with
auburn
accents
forming
a
light
beige
head
atop
small
bubbles
but
with
poor
retention
and
lacing
aroma
is
predominantly
butterscotch
and
toffee
not
even
a
hint
of
smoke
here
folks
thin
fizzy
mouthfeel
with
a
light
body
taste
is
earthy
amber
malts
with
earthy
bittering
hops
and
thats
about
it
starting
things
off
at
a
lovely
new
localish
bar
with
a
rauchbier
i
thought
had
passed
me
by
long
ago
it
pours
a
clear
topazsienna
topped
by
a
halffinger
of
dirty
ash
foam
the
nose
comprises
hickorysmoked
honeyglazed
ham
caramel
light
charcoal
and
a
hint
of
pear
the
taste
brings
in
more
of
the
same
the
ham
character
droned
out
a
bit
by
some
extra
smoke
and
caramel
the
body
is
a
lithe
medium
with
a
light
moderate
carbonation
and
a
sortakinda
drying
finish
overall
a
very
nice
rauchbier
nice
and
heavy
on
the
smoke
without
overdoing
it
i
approve
everytime
i
burped
for
the
duration
of
the
night
it
was
appalling
and
foul
will
not
be
trying
this
one
again
d
a
solid
rauchbier
that
i
enjoyed
for
the
most
part
true
to
style
and
surprising
easytodrink
once
the
bubbles
die
down
one
of
the
few
revolution
beers
where
the
party
mug
feels
appropriate
served
on
tap
at
the
brewery
the
appearance
is
a
clear
amber
with
thin
head
the
nose
is
exactly
as
the
nose
would
imply
tons
of
smoke
the
aroma
is
straight
campfire
with
some
caramel
and
amber
malts
in
the
background
the
taste
is
more
of
the
same
tons
of
wood
char
campfire
and
smoke
the
body
is
light
with
medium
carbonation
overall
this
beer
certainly
features
the
flavor
and
aroma
of
smoke
very
well
i
would
say
that
it
dominates
the
beer
and
the
malt
and
hops
are
tough
to
pick
out
as
a
result
turbid
muddy
brown
appearance
with
an
off
white
head
of
one
finger
that
fades
at
a
glacial
pace
smells
of
smoky
cured
meats
summer
sausage
bacon
beef
jerky
and
pepperoni
the
cured
meat
aromas
from
the
nose
carry
over
to
the
palate
in
only
the
slightest
manner
which
is
probably
a
good
thing
i
get
smokey
toasted
malt
followed
by
a
nice
shot
of
acidity
to
keep
this
very
drinkable
the
mouthfeel
is
incredible
rich
thick
and
creamy
new
glarus
and
lakefronts
rauchbiers
are
the
only
ive
previously
had
both
were
good
but
nothing
special
black
huskys
is
easily
a
step
or
two
above
this
is
a
must
try
if
youre
into
smoked
beers
o
i
was
warned
about
this
beer
by
the
owner
and
brewmaster
tim
about
a
month
before
opening
it
his
exact
words
escape
me
but
essentially
smoke
monster
isnt
usually
supposed
to
turn
out
this
way
i
cant
speak
to
how
smoke
monster
normally
turns
out
but
whatever
he
did
to
mess
it
up

this
had
me
at
its
stylistic
description
a
rauchweizen
right
on
right
on
it
pours
a
mostly
clear
garnet
topped
by
a
finger
of
sandstone
foam
the
nose
comprises
buttery
biscuit
backed
up
by
a
hint
of
beech
smoke
hm
the
taste
holds
notes
of
cracked
wheat
light
orange
zest
mild
dry
toffee
clove
and
mild
beech
smoke
the
body
is
a
light
medium
with
a
light
moderate
carbonation
and
a
fluid
feel
overall
this
beer
was
a
bit
of
a
disappointment
to
me
the
smell
is
too
vague
for
its
own
good
the
smoke
character
is
barely
there
and
the
weizen
character
is
subdued
you
cant
see
it
but
my
head
is
hanging
a
bit
here
great
stuff
not
the
most
aggressive
rauch
but
packed
with
flavors
and
a
bit
more
easy
to
drink
than
many
bambergerborn
ones
a
pleasant
and
approachable
version
of
this
most
heady
of
german
brewing
styles
the
weizen
character
as
notable
as
the
meaty
smoke
for
the
most
part
easy
to
drink
until
the
unchecked
sweetness
catches
up
to
you
and
you
start
to
think
about
that
as
yet
unused
fire
pit
simulacrum
you
just
procured
i
think
i
like
this
beer
id
drink
a
lot
of
this
throughout
the
summer
very
light
but
full
of
flavor
and
the
smokiness
im
a
sucker
for
o
this
beer
didnt
seem
as
heavy
on
the
mouthfeel
compared
to
other
rauchbiers
and
i
think
this
was
because
the
beer
is
branded
as
a
rauchweizen
and
is
brewed
with
a
combination
of
wheat
and
barley
malts
for
this
reason
it
is
rather
drinkable
served
in
a
0

liter
stange

murky
rusty
brown
color
with
a
small
beige

minimal

bready

the
taste
caramel
sweetness
bready

banana

honey
ham
a
little
weird
but
not
necessarily
bad
medium
body
and
pretty
easily
drinkable
especially
when
paired
with
good
german
food
decent
overall
but
not
really
worth
a
second
visit
flavors
of
charred
malt
burnt
caramel
somewhat
nutty
and
lightly
bitter
in
the
aftertaste
body
was
full
fairly
smooth
and
creamy
in
feel
left
more
of
an
impression
of
a
roast
malt
brown
ale
this
was
an
odd
one
couldnt
really
get
into
it
though
i
love
rauchbiers
across
the
whole
spectrum
the
initial
taste
is
fairly
neutral
but
the
finish
is
strongsmoky
with
lots
of
wheat
present
the
body
is
thin
and
the
carbonation
elevated
the
aftertaste
is
short
lived
and
a
bit
sour
interesting
because
it
is
different
but
not
enough
to
seek
out
its
rare
so
i
would
order
if
you
find
it
a
quite
pleasant
beer
with
smoke
that
is
not
too
strong
pours
a
murky
orangebrown
with
a
foamy
orangetan
head
that
settles
to
a
partial
film
on
top
of
the
beer
small
dots
of
lace
form
around
the
glass
on
the
drink
down
smell
is
of
malt
grain
and
smoke
aromas
taste
is
much
the
same
with
smoke
and
metallic
flavors
on
the
finish
there
is
a
mild
amount
of
smoke
bitterness
on
the
palate
with
each
sip
this
beer
has
a
lower
level
of
carbonation
with
a
slightly
crisp
mouthfeel
overall
this
is
an
above
average
beer
with
some
decent
aromas
and
flavors
overall
i
thought
this
was
a
pretty
nice
beer
and
i
thought
it
was
a
nice
and
pretty
unique
example
of
a
rauchbier
i
thought
the
fruit
aspect
worked
well
with
the
lighter
medium
smoke
and
the
combination
was
somehow
a
little
refreshing
which
i
liked
its
like
a
smoked
beer
for
the
summer
this
beer
had
pretty
good
drinkability
it
was
smooth
pretty
crisp
slightly
crispy
strangely
refreshing
not
filling
at
all
and
the
taste
did
a
nice
job
at
holding
my
attention
i
dont
think
i
would
mind
drinking
a
couple
pints
of
this
and
like
i
said
i
think
it
makes
for
a
good
warmer
weather
rauchbier
what
i
liked
the
most
about
this
beer
was
that
the
smoke
was
at
just
the
right
level
and
i
also
thought
the
mouthfeel
and
drinkability
were
pretty
good
those
were
the
highlights
of
this
beer
what
i
like
the
least
about
this
beer
was
that
more
of
those
vivant
yeast
flavors
didnt
come
through
i
think
that
would
make
this
beer
just
a
little
better
i
would
buy
this
again
if
i
had
the
chance
its
just
the
type
of
rauchbier
i
want
to
drink
in
warmer
weather
and
i
would
recommend
this
to
most
people
i
think
its
worth
trying
at
least
once
all
in
all
i
was
pretty
happy
with
this
beer
it
was
just
about
the
same
as
i
remember
it
and
i
just
think
its
another
tasty
and
unique
beer
made
by
brewery
vivant
it
isnt
my
favorite
rauchbier
but
it
might
be
the
most
drinkable
one
ive
had
and
its
the
only
one
that
i
would
call
a
little
refreshing
its
not
my
favorite
vivant
beer
but
its
got
a
solid
place
in
their
specialty
lineup
nice
job
guys
this
was
a
very
solid
and
unique
rauchbier
keep
up
the
good
work
overall
i
am
not
a
huge
fan
of
smoked
beers
but
i
seem
to
enjoy
them
more
with
a
dark
beer
base
this
beer
is
just
way
too
dominated
by
the
smokiness
and
saltiness
i
also
dont
enjoy
how
meaty
the
taste
is
just
came
on
tap
at
my
job
so
it
pours
up
a
nice
cloudy
rust
color
with
a
lil
decent
white
crown
aromas
consists
of
very
faint
malts
and
absolutely
no
smokiness
or
pork
or
any
traditional
rauch
aromas
tastes
of
pretty
damn
sweet
malts
a
kiss
of
hop
backdrop
and
no
smokiness
not
impressed
here
the
mediumleaningtofull
body
was
great
and
the
carbo
was
nice
and
crisp
it
wasnt
a
terrible
brew
a
little
too
sweet
in
my
opinion
but
they
sell
this
too
you
saying
it
keeps
in
the
old
germanic
rauch
tradition
but
ive
had
quite
a
few
rauch
brews
from
germany
and
this
wasnt
like
them
sorry
circle
not
this
time
i
suspect
this
beer
is
homage
to
roger
baylors
wellknown
love
of
smoked
franconian
rauchbiers
i
find
this
to
be
a
wellbalanced
and
easily
drinkable
smoked
beer
it
is
so
drinkable
that
it
would
be
easy
to
gloss
over
the
subtle
yet
present
layers
of
this
enjoyable
beer
i
am
confident
this
would
pair
well
with
anything
from
your
grill
or
smoker
this
summer
4
75
d
very
solid
rauchbier
plenty
of
flavor
with
depth
and
complexity
and
a
killer
mouthfeel
both
the
taste
and
mouthfeel
were
borderline
4
75
so
i
put
it
here
instead
something
id
never
buy
but
was
an
interesting
extra
the
flavors
while
smokey
seemed
muted
and
the
body
was
a
bit
thin
happy
to
have
tried
it
but
once
was
enough
for
me
when
the
bottle
foamed
out
of
the
top
just
a
wee
little
bit
and
it
was
über
foam
on
the
pour
i
was
concerned
apparently
without
warrant
this
is
an
outstanding
rauch
mild
smoked
tones
keep
things
at
what
i
want
to
say
is
a
perfect
tone
this
can
so
easily
go
obnoxious
this
is
a
real
pleasure
to
drink
dont
want
to
write
about
it
just
want
to
enjoy
drinking
it
overall
its
not
bad
i
appreciate
the
highish
abv
but
could
do
without
the
watery
feel
really
an
attractive
looking
and
smelling
beer
just
loses
it
a
bit
after
that
o
reminded
me
a
bit
of
a
baltic
porter
very
nice
really
cool
name
for
a
beer
the
beer
is
black
with
a
small
brown
head
the
aroma
brings
some
lager
scents
roast
smoke
the
flavor
lacks
cohesion
i
love
the
idea
of
combining
the
attributes
of
a
black
lager
and
a
smoke
beer
but
this
marriage
just
doesnt
make
it
slightly
sweet
with
some
chocolate
and
smoke
notes
medium
bodied
with
adequate
carbonation
overall
this
was
ok
black
body
with
not
even
a
finger
of
medium
brown
head
even
with
an
extra
aggressive
pour
nose
has
a
tad
of
campfire
smoke
brown
sugar
toasty
malts
chocolate
and
some
sweeter
caramelmarshmallow
qualities
tate
has
more
chocolate
and
smokey
sweetness
mild
roast
and
a
sweet
malt
quality
well
into
the
finish
smoke
as
an
accent
there
really
medium
heavy
feel
low
carbonation
which
although
i
thought
wouldve
been
detrimental
to
the
mouthfeel
actually
aided
the
beer
smokey
and
on
the
sweeter
side
something
i
definitely
dig
if
you
like
smoked
beers
this
is
a
musttry
i
enjoyed
this
beer
but
didnt
love
it
i
like
the
smoked
notes
but
it
needs
to
be
a
bit
richer
to
add
complexity
overall
still
comes
across
a
bit
watery
22
ounce
bottle
served
in
a
mug
the
beer
pours
a
very
dark
brown
with
a
huge
carbonated
dark
tan
head
once
the
head
settled
down
some
a
slow
pour
helped
keep
the
carbonation
down
some
when
pouring
the
rest
of
the
bottle
into
the
glass
head
retention
is
good
and
theres
also
a
decent
amount
of
lacing
aroma
is
very
nice

it
tastes

roastedcharred
malt
coffee
and
some

mouthfeelbody
is
medium
its
a
bit
creamy
but
has
way
too
much
carbonation
even
though
the
carbonation
did
settle
down
some
while
i
was
drinking
it
it
was
still
a
bit
too
much
for
me
in
the
end
overall
i
thought
this
was
a
good
brew
ill
try
this
again
in
the
future
and
hope
that
the
carbonation
in
the
next
bottle
isnt
as
strong
as
this
one
was
7
99
a
bottle
overall
one
of
the
more
sweet
offerings
ive
had
in
this
style
drinkable
in
small
quantities
almost
tastes
flat
bonfire
of
the
valkyries
pours
a
medium
bodied
smooth
and
creamy
black
in
color
looking
all
the
part
of
a
schwarzbier
it
has
a
nice
beige
lacing
around
the
glass
the
nose
is
slightly
smoky
with
some
ham
and
salt
before
finishes
smooth
chocolaty
and
creamy
the
smoke
isnt
nearly
as
strong
as
i
imagined
it
would
be
but
thats
a
good
thing
there
isnt
much
smoke
in
the
flavors
either
but
its
there
its
smooth
and
creamy
dark
chocolate
with
a
light
hammy
finish
its
like
a
slightly
smoked
version
of
sprechers
black
bavarian
the
body
is
near
identical
light
and
very
very
smooth
and
creamy
overall
this
was
a
really
nice
beer
id
definitely
say
its
a
schwarzbier
thats
slightly
smoked
and
not
necessarily
a
rauchbier
its
a
nice
alternative
if
you
dont
want
to
get
smoked
out
by
aecht
schlenkerla
overalll
this
has
piqued
my
interest
in
what
this
stuff
is
supposed
to
taste
like
ive
had
a
few
that
were
beers
with
nice
hints
of
smoke
ill
come
back
and
rereview
if
i
learn
this
is
just
the
style
o
after
being
underwhelmed
by
new
albanians
baltic
porter
this
smoked
black
lager
kind
of
surprised
me
its
not
the
best
rauchbier
ive
ever
had
but
it
is
interesting
and
quite
drinkable
i
still
think
new
albanians
strength
lies
in
their
strong
ales
but
i
wouldnt
mind
picking
this
lager
up
again
o
much
better
than
i
expected
and
very
easy
to
drink
i
am
glad
the
smoke
was
not
overpowering
quite
drinkable
and
i
might
go
back
and
get
a
bomber
of
this
brew
this
is
probably
one
of
my
favorites
from

the
risk
paid
off
this
time
d
this
beer
was
mighty
drinkable
i
personally
enjoy
heavy
smoked
beers
which
this
one
leaned
more
toward
being
heavy
in
the
smoke
taste
the
abv
makes
this
one
enjoyable
while
drinking
i
had
many
glasses
of
this
but
i
know
some
of
the
other
guys
didnt
like
this
one
very
much
pours
a
dark
brownblack
with
a
finger
of
tan
head
smells
roasty
a
little
smoky
and
a
hint
of
sweet
malt
tastes
some
roasted
malts
hints
of
chocolate
some
smokyness
and
coffee
but
really
balanced
slightly
drying
finish
but
a
good
mouthfeel
and
drinkable
one
of
the
better
beers
ive
had
in
this
style
solid
schwarzbier
its
pitch
black
in
appearance
and
smells
of
roast
coffee
and
chocolate
the
foam
lacing
doesnt
stick
for
too
long
the
taste
is
very
similar
to
the
smell
black
malt
must
have
been
a
key
ingredient
some
vanilla
lingers
in
the
back
with
a
possibility
of
liquid
smoke
easy
to
drink
not
too
sticky
had
on
tap
at
barley
island
broad
ripple
as
a
guest
beer
served
at
the
tomlinson
tap
room
in
indy
appearance
was
totally
black
with
not
much
carbonation
and
very
little
tan
colored
head
aroma
is
not
very
strong
but
smells
of
roasted
malt
primarily
with
some
sweetness
and
a
faint
hint
of
smoke
the
flavor
is
great
with
smooth
maltiness
roasted
coffee
and
chocolate
lightly
blending
with
a
touch
of
smoke
very
smooth
and
drinkable
medium
to
full
bodied
a
very
nice
beer
d
not
my
fave
of
the
ales
offered
at
nabc
but
still
drinkable
and
better
than
average
imo
a
big
smokey
ale
that
can
get
to
be
a
bit
much
if
you
have
more
than
a
pint
of
smoked
ale
i
consider
this
quaffable
and
would
be
a
nice
complement
to
and
smoked
cheese
or
meat
assortment
on
tap
at
richos
publick
house
as
part
of
the
saturnalia
fest
bonfire
arrived
dark
and
opaque
in
the
glass
topped
by
a
small
but
creamy
light
brown
head
sheet
lacing
is
left
behind
on
the
glass
as
it
empties
aroma
is
wood
smoke
minimal
spicy
hops
and
cocoa
and
espresso
notes
creamy
medium
body
taste
is
smoky
but
not
overdone
nice
edge
of
bitter
hops
to
compliment
the
slightly
roasty
tones
of
mild
coffee
and
light
milk
chocolate
a
very
enjoyable
version
of
the
style
horrible
and
not
enjoyable
in
any
way
overall
certainly
a
good
beer
that
combined
some
elements
of
a
hefeweizen
with
the
intricacies
of
a
rauchbier
and
while
the
overall
feel
is
a
bit
lighter
and
probably
a
bit
more
approachable
for
craft
newbies
the
smokiness
is
less
thorough
and
not
quite
as
enjoyable
still
a
great
beer
combining
some
fruitiness
with
smoked
meats
in
such
a
waym
is
no
easy
feat
certainly
an
interesting
beer
albeit
not
one
of
want
all
the
time
id
like
to
try
their
smoked
marzen
aecht
schlenkerla
rauchbier
weizen
offers
all
the
meaty
and
campfire
qualities
i
love
about
the
märzen
but
in
a
leaner
lighter
package
theres
really
no
reason
to
feel
intimidated
here
as
the
singed
roughhewn
wood
notes
are
even
more
deeply
entwined
with
sweet
malt
fruity
esters
and
spicysavory
phenolics
its
one
thatll
certainly
change
peoples
impressions
of
beer
been
working
my
way
through
the
schlenkerla
offerings
thus
far
really
enjoying
the
marzen
and
not
being
so
fond
of
the
eiche
didnt
know
what
to
expect
with
weizen
other
than
a
recent
newfound
appreciation
for
weizens
but
this
one
jumped
the
tracks
pretty
quickly
totally
could
be
an
old
bottle
issue
and
id
happily
revisit
it
again
to
make
sure
but
for
now
i
have
to
score
it
low
best
way
to
describe
it
would
be
bbqflavored
potato
chips
literally
smelled
salty
the
weisse
bier
notes
just
couldnt
be
found
too
muddled
in
with
the
salty
bbq
smoked
malt
i
choked
down
as
much
as
i
could
before
waving
the
white
flag
again
hope
to
find
it
on
tap
someday
to
verify
these
findings
o
i
think
i
like
it
better
than
the
smoked
marzen
but
its
a
lot
of
the
same
which
is
to
say
a
ton
of
smoke
flavor
that
manages
to
remain
well
short
of
tasting
burnt
it
really
is
like
a
toasted
flavor
or
the
duh
flavor
of
the
smoke
coming
off
a
burning
log
not
the
burning
log
overall
not
schlenkerlas
best
but
even
that
puts
in
squarely
in
the
top
5
of
beers
a
great
beer
that
shows
what
can
be
done
without
brewing
with
adjuncts
one
of
my
favorite
rauchbiere
recommended

single

moderately

with
a
slight
spicy
note
the
smoke
aroma
is
not
as
intense
as
their
marzen
and
urbock
variants
and
is
expertly
balanced
with
sweetness
light
medium
body
that
is
somewhat
slick
in

also
has
a
grainy

a
bit
of
effervescence
in
the
finish
and
middle
the
outstanding
flavor
profile
is
not
as
intense
as
their
other
variants
it
is
more
balanced
with
malt
sweetness
and
a
bit
more
complex
the
delicious
smoke
character
is
always
present
but
never
overpowering
it
begins
with
a
moderate
campfire
bacon
like
smoke
over
a
sweet
background
that
has
both
biscuit
and
caramel
characteristics
the
middle
allows
the
hops
to
impart
a
rather
low
level
bitterness
that
has
a
clove
like
note
as
it
effervesces
and
a
banana
quality
as
it
fades
the
finish
is
dryer
than
the
others
somewhat
crisp
sweeter
and
leaves
you
with
a
touch
of
clove
and
a
lingering
smokiness
as
if
youve
sitting
around

campfire

the

was
nice
4
a
very
old
style
and
traditional
one
that
warrants
your
investigation
and
more
brewers
in
the
new
world
riffing
on
smoked
weissbier
you
say
im
game
as
a
weissbier
connoisseur
i
was
curious
to
try
this
variation
would
it
be
like
a
dunkles
weissbier
or
a
thing
of
its
own
making
pour
dark
muddy
coffee
dark
in
a
weihenstephaner
weissbier
glass
average
head
that
dissipates
to
nothing
after
a
few
minutes
smell
is
wonderful
aroma
of
warm
smoked
meat
leather
taste
follows
the
smell
as
smoked
malt
followed
by
the
tart
cloves
and
a
touch
of
sweetness
mouthfeel
is
unexpectedly
light
and
carbonation
is
weak
and
this
is
where
this
beer
comes
up
short
its
a
nice
change
of
pace
from
a
weissbier
or
dunkles
weissbier
but
id
think
twice
before
paying
5bottle
for
another
one
aecht
schlenkerla
rauchbier
weizen
isnt
as
good
as
its
märzen
cousin
still
the
wheatinspired
flavors
bring
out
some
interesting
aspects
of
the
smoked
malts
give
it
a
try
overall
fantastic
this
is
a
playground
for
a
mans
palet
overall
this
is
an
enjoyable
smoked
wheat
beer
and
one
i
would
certainly
return
to
pours
a
murky
dirty
brown
with
a
big
tan
head
smells
like
banana
and
allspice
taste
begins
with
some
banana
flavor
then
some
light
grain
then
some
deep
smokiness
and
finishing
with
a
rich
bread
flavor
mouthfeel
is
rich
overall
a
fantastic
beer
the
only
downside
is
its
less
than
stellar
appearance
this
rauchbier
is
more
easydrinking
than
typical
and
forms
an
excellent
accompaniment
to
a
perfectly
clear
sunny
summer
afternoon
this
beer
lends
itself
to
long
casual
conversations
memories
of
childhood
summers
relaxing
with
friends
and
smoked
whiting
while
conversations
lasted
well
into
the
cool
night
its
a
pretty
straightforward
beer
it
smells
like
burnt
birch
branches
and
it
tastes
like
beef
jerky
encrusted
with
barbecue
flavoured
potato
chips
this
a
beer
style
all
its
own
so
unique
in
fact
that
the
characteristic
flavour
profiles
dominate
to
the
extent
that
its
really
difficult
for
anything
to
come
through
that
reminds
us
this
is
beer
it
could
just
be
some
sort
of
beef
jerky
flavoured
soda
or
maybe
fermented
diluted
barbecue
sauce
that
said
its
not
bad
really
its
probably
an
acquired
taste
for
most
my
chief
complaint
is
that
its
not
thicker
for
something
this
robust
my
palette
demands
that
it
be
thicker
if
it
tastes
like
im
eating
woodsmoked
meat
i
dont
want
it
to
feel
like
im
drinking
water
you
know
i
crave
the
consistency
of
a
stout
or
at
least
a
doppelbock
when
im
drinking
this
i
also
wish
some
maltiness
could
come
through
to
complement
the
smoked
meat
flavour
its
got
a
really
basic
flavour
to
how
dominant
that
smokiness
is
i
know
thats
just
the
way
this
style
is
meant
to
be
though
so
i
shouldnt
really
be
applying
that
to
my
criticism
of
this
specific
example
i
really
do
hope
i
come
across
a
version
of
this
thats
got
a
thicker
mouthfeel
one
day
though
thatd
be
pretty
great
that
said
this
is
an
overall
an
extremely
enjoyable
drinkable
beer
that
i
highly
recommend
but
please
leave
some
for
me
at
the
downtown
specs
cause
i
will
be
back
overall
better
than
other
smoke
beers
that
i
have
had
that
dont
have
a
backbone
well
put
together
for
this
style
o
so
glad
this
finally
got
distributed
to
tx
i
picked
this
and
the
doppelbock
up
this
did
not
disappoint
this
is
another
stellar
beer
by
schlenkerla
not
my
favorite
from
them
but
another
example
of
what
they
do
so
well
a
clean
wonderful
german
alelager
with
smoked
flavors
remarks
did
not
score
a
t
s
m
at
that
time
disregard
those
scores
as
a
rauchbier
this
beer
hits
it
with
the
taste
there
is
a
slight
smoothness
to
the
feel
with
the
wheat
and
the
cloudiness
fits
in
nicely
with
classic
german
weizen
stylings
an
excellent
choice
for
anyone
wanting
to
try
a
rauchbier
but
dont
necessarily
want
to
start
off
with
schlenkerlas

examples

murky

which
has

color
and
clarity
of

head
is
one
inch
dense
fluffy
and
offwhite
nose
expresses
a
hint
of
smoke
and
some
dark
fruits
similar
to
a
weizebbock
in
character
with
a
trace
of
clove
and
banana
esters
towards
the
back
taste
is
quite
mild
on
all
accounts
smoke
is
very
subdued
but
masks
a
lot
of
the
character
of
a
typical
weizen
there
is
a
bit
of
fruitiness
but
its
really
a
bit
muddled
theres
also
a
slight
herbalpeppery
quality
to
the
flavor
profile
mouthfeel
is
lightmedium
in
body
but
closer
to
light
with
a
carbonation
that
is
not
quite
crisp
but
does
have
a
bit
of
a
bite
definitely
an
interesting
take
on
the
style
but
not
really
something
i
would
look
for
in
a
wheat
beer
beer
is
medium
to
mediumlight
in
body
with
plenty
of
soft
effervescent
carbonation
the
result
is
a
smooth
slightly
fizzy
at
first
then
rather
foamy
mouthfeel
that
meshes
well
with
the
body
closes
rather
dry
with
little
residual
stickiness
on
the
palate
poured
with
swirled
yeast
sediment
its
a
cloudy
brown
colored
ale
topped
with
a
tan

smoky
aroma
faint
wheat
and
hefeweizen
with

coming
out

tastes
are
fruity
tart
smoky
actually
refreshing
with
some
banana
notes
as
it
warms
lighter
body
with
moderate
carbonation
overall
pretty
good
classic
rauchbier
here
but
i
preferred
their
märzen
or
doppelbock
over
this
one
overall
im
still
getting
used
to
rauchbiers
and
this
one
seems
an
awful
lot
more
drinkable
than
the
urboch
i
think
ill
have
to
have
quite
a
few
more
of
these
before
i
allow
myself
to
pass
any
kind
of
judgement
on
them

i
need
to
try
it
again
with
a
food
pairing
the
beer
on
its
own
was
just
a
little
too
intense
for
me
rjt
o
good
but
go
for
the
marzen
for
your
bacon
beer
the
blend
of
the
german
yeast
strain
and
the
smoked
malts
is
quite
good
smoky
bananas
mmmm
this
makes
we
want
to
go
start
a
campfire
because
it
reminds
of
those
pesky
nights
starting
the
fire
for
the
campsite
i
was
initially
afraid
to
taste
this
beer
given
it
was
hard
to
picture
a
smoked
wheat
beer
but
they
made
it
work
their
marzen
version
is
awesome
but
this
one
is
also
incredible
and
maybe
a
bigger
brewer
challenge
for
that
this
should
bear
a
good
score
nice
beer
but
probably
my
least
favorite
schlenkerla
beer
it
is
not
bad
but
i
l
prefer
other
flavours
im
my
hefeweizens
and
i
also
think
the
smoke
goes
better
with
their
urbock
or
the
märzen
version
this
is
definitely
a
tasty
and
distinct
beer
i
gulped
a
pint
down
in
a
matter
of
minutes
which
speaks
to
its
smoothness
and
drinkability
despite
the
strong
smoke
overtones
it
has
a
refreshing
quality
still
not
something
id
want
to
have
frequenting
my
glass
because
of
the
distinct
flavor
but
it
could
definitely
enter
into
my
beer
rotation
would
go
amazingly
well
at
a
barbeque
on
a
summer
night
due
to
the
smokey
taste
and
refreshing
quality
considering
the
price
point
isnt
too
harsh
its
certainly
worth
checking
out
as
i
said
more
on
the
nose
but
it
may
be
the
fault
of
my
nose
but
i
still
would
top
it
out
at
4
75
i
would
like
more
creaminess
and
more
body
on
the
mouth
feel
but
i
guess
it
is
a
marzen
so
stylistically
it
is
correct
in
the
taste
profile
more
wood
and
a
little
less
oil
but
that
is
a
personal
preference
i
love
wood
smoke
its
an
intro
rauchbier
the
marzen
is
a
waste
for
me
give
me
more
body
and
more
smoke
and
more
smoke
and
more
smoke
and
body
and
smoke
the
4
35
average
it
gets
is
generous
considering
my
tastes
it
would
only
be
about
a
3
83
95
this
was
lovely
theres
a
good
weissbier
base
working
here
and
the
added
smokiness
just
ups
it
o
of
the
three
marzen
urbock
weizen
aecht
schlenkerla
rauchbiers
this
is
the
most
balanced
and
approachable
to
a
rauchbier
novice
in
my
opinion
i
could
session
drink
this
one
where
the
other
two
are
tasting
beers
o
as
usual
with
this
brewery
a
solid
smoke
beer
i
think
this
style
is
a
little
too
light
to
really
utilize
the
smoked
barley
but
its
still
good
nonetheless
i
prefer
the
marzen
and
urbock
but
this
is
still
recommended
if
you
like
rauchbier
poured
into
a
samuel
adams
perfect
pint
glass
pours
dark
toffee
brown
like
a
dunkel
with
a
thick
white
head
it
appears
to
be
well
carbonated
the
aroma
is
of
light
smoke
and
wheat
malt
i
dont
get
any
expected
weizen
notes
like
banana
and
clove
the
taste
is
more
reflective
of
a
weizen
with
notes
of
the
smoked
malt
i
get
some
of
the
banana
and
clove
pairing
with
the
mild
smokiness
of
the
malts
there
are
some
chocolate
notes
as
well
the
body
is
light
with
moderate
carbonation
the
finish
is
smooth
and
clean
the
drinkability
is
high
this
is
an
excellent
beer
d
this
was
very
tasty
classic
weissbier
flavours
with
a
nice
chocolatesmoked
mix
of
side
notes
was
very
tasty
with
my
lumberjack
pork
fillet
poured
into
a
celebrator
pokal
pours
a
rich
orange
amber
with
massive
carbonation
strings
rising
through
the
glass
three
finger
fine
off
white
head
that
continued
to
slowly
build
until
settling
into
a
long
lasting
cap
with
massive
lacing
nice
smoked
aroma
with
hint
of
smoked
meat
and
malt
very
faint
wheat
flavor
is
light
wheat
with
complex
smoky
wood
elements
finishes
somewhat
dry
and
smokey
the
smoke
dominates
the
light
wheat
and
malt
flavors
but
is
still
pleasant
the
maltier
styles
seem
to
blend
their
character
with
the
smoke
a
little
better
than
this
and
i
miss
the
weizen
flavors
still
a
pleasant
smoked
beer
from
a
great
brewery
nice
medium
body
with
a
hint
of
creaminess
more
similar
to
some
of
the
scandanavian
smoked
beers
this
is
a
very
good
beer
ive
tried
all
the
rauchbiers
from
brewery
and
theyre
all
great
overall
another
great
beer
from
schlenkerla
if
you
are
looking
for
huge
smoke
in
a
lighter
package
this
is
it
if
you
are
looking
for
rauch
in
general
schlenkerla
is
forever
a
great
decision
if
you
do
not
like
smoke
in
your
beer
do
not
even
think
about
touching
this
to
your
lips
o
easy
to
drink
and
enjoyable
this
would
pair
exceptionally
well
with
any
kinds
of
smoked
meat
great
complementary
flavors
like
bbq
or
bacon
i
enjoyed
this
beer
shortly
after
enjoying
a
grilled
hot
dog
and
burger
and
that
matched
very
well
i
like
the
fact
that
the
smokiness
in
this
beer
is
not
overwhelming
o
not
complex
but
highly
enjoyable
this
is
one
of
the
beers
in
the
style
that
can
convert
people
and
make
them
drinkers
of
rauchbier
i
certainly
am
now
pours
a
murky
brown
smoke
is
big
on
the
nose
and
the
taste
the
wheat
properties
peer
through
but
in
a
lot
of
regards
its
hard
to
distinguish
from
its
marzen
brother
i
can
tell
that
this
one
isnt
as
thick
but
the
smoke
character
which
is
a
major
part
of
the
beer
is
almost
identical
im
overstating
this
a
bit
i
know
overall
i
do
like
the
marzen
better
and
this
one
doesnt
seem
to
be
a
necessary
try
for
all
but
its
still
an
exemplary
rauchbier
pours
a
murky
chestnut
brown
color
with
a
dense
but
foamy
beige
head
the
aroma
is
a
robust
combination
of
smoked
meat
earth
crusty
bread
and
only
a
whisper
of
a
wheaty
tang
the
flavor
similarly
features
a
rich
smokey
complexity
and
yet
rather
than
being
overpowering
it
provides
more
of
a
soft
comforting
woodiness
with
the
smoke
largely
dominating
the
flavor
the
wheat
is
not
featured
but
merely
provides
a
light
dry
cereal
sweetness
the
texture
is
light
on
the
tongue
without
being
watery
and
a
fine
prickly
carbonation
cuts
through
the
meaty
substance
overall
the
smoked
characteristic
is
apparent
up
front
but
it
is
well
controlled
making
this
a
beer
that
i
would
be
happy
to
have
again
o
i
really
liked
this
one
its
not
as
smokeforward
as
their
marzen
and
still
tastes
like
a
good
probably
dunkel
weissbier
i
already
love
the
märzen
and
this
one
might
top
it
need
to
do
a
hellertrum
sidebysidebysidebyside
soon
such
a
fascinating
brew
will
pick
this
up
next
time
i
see
it
for
sure

nice

woodiness
with
some

there
somewhere
odd
but
very
nice
seems
light

most
certainly
heavy
on

theres
a
sharpness
in

too
suggesting
the
wheat
making
its
presence
known
among
the
smokydelicious

this
is
a
unique
and
delicious
beer
overall
an
interesting
weizen
but
still
an
average
rauchbier
or
at
least
an
average
style
to
attack
with
smoke
o
this
is
an
exceptional
bier
ive
never
had
anything
quite
like
it
but
now
that
i
know
what
im
in
for
i
look
forward
to
trying
more
in
this
line

of
the

small
dots
of
lace
slowly
drip
into
the
remaining

on
the

down
smell
is
of
smoked

smoked

smoked

and
some
slight
bandaid

taste
is
of
smoked
meatcheese
up
front
with
a
definite
wheat
presence
in
the
middle
and
finishing
with
a
smoked
wheat
aftertaste
this
beer
has
a
good
level
of
carbonation
with
a
crisp
mouthfeel
overall
this
is
a
good
rauchbier
that
still
allows
the
wheat
used
to
come
across
in
the
flavor
o
it
was
no
surprise
to
me
that
i
love
this
because
i
love
all
of
their
beers
im
dying
to
try
this
with
a
warm
bbq
soon
actually
what
i
really
want
it
with
is
a
bbq
chicken
pizza
this
is
an
outstanding
beer
while
not
my
favorite
of
the
schlenkerla
series
it
is
an
interesting
take
on
a
witbier
and
is
amazingly
refreshing
and
quaffable
half
finger
rapidly
dissipating

on
a
murky
golden
with
a
brownish
orange
hue
no
lacing
really
aroma
is
very
smokey
with
wheat
and
honey
notes
the
flavor
is
very
smokey
with
mesquite
notes
but
overall
compared
to
others
in
the
genre
this
one
is
subdued
the
wheat
can
be
experienced
throughtout
high
carbonation
and
light
to
medium
body
o
i
absolutely
love
it
i
should
add
that
this
bottle
was
2
months
past
its
bb
date
o
extremely
easy
to
drink
highly
recommended
beer
o
not
my
style
but
i
think
i
could
have
one
every
once
in
a
while
o
an
enjoyable
and
easy
drinking
rauchbier
for
the
style
this
is
extremely
well
done
it
seems
this
style
is
much
like
bourbon
barrel
ales
it
isnt
a
style
as
much
as
a
finishing
element
but
because
of
tradition
it
has
a
style
i
like
the
smoke
flavors
but
some
element
of
this
process
isnt
working
with
the
hef
i
really
think
there
is
potential
for
these
two
to
mesh
but
either
a
touch
less
smoke
or
a
touch
more
malt
is
needed
to
get
things
going
in
the
right
direction
d
another
keeper
from
schlenkerla
this
is
the
6th
beer
ive
had
from
these
guys
and
while
it
is
not
my
favorite
it
is
a
very
unique
brew
that
plays
wheat
and
smoke
very
well
together
carbonation
is
much
too
high
pours
a
dirty
dark
brown
with
a
fluffy
khakicolored
head
that
settles
to
a
thick
cap
lovely
smoke
aromas
that
reminds
me
of
woodgrilled
salmon
oily
spicy
and
wonderfully
meaty
this
is
a
great
smelling
rauchbier
weizen
flavors
of
banana
and
clove
come
through
in
the
flavor
only
to
be
swallowed
up
by
more
of
that
fishy
smoke
i
gotta
admit
the
weizen
backbone
isnt
as
appealing
to
me
as
the
more
traditional
marzen
i
just
feel
the
caramelmalt
flavors
stand
up
to
and
compliment
the
smoke
better
still
good
though
my
qualms
with
the
weizen
backbone
carry
through
to
the
mouthfeel
i
could
definitely
go
for
something
a
bit
more
substantial
as
is
were
looking
at
a
touchunder
mediumbodied
slightly
creamy
with
moderately
crisp
carbonation
overall
a
very
solid
addition
to
schlenkerlas
wonderful
rauchbier
lineup
but
certainly
not
my
favorite
mediumbodied
with
good
carbonation
smokiness
lingers
on
the
palate
after
every
swallow
easy
drinking
if
youre
more
keen
on
the
smokey
quality
of
rauchbiers
märzen
is
the
better
option
but
the
weizen
still
holds
its
own
nicely
and
is
as
equally
as
enjoyable
pours
a
muddy
dark
brown
with
some
shades
of
mahogany
and
and
chestnut
around
the
edges
tan
head
with
some
floaties
in
the
body
maybe
i
shouldnt
have
poured
the
yeast
in
big
sticky
lacing
great
retention
and
good
amounts
of
carbonation
stream
up
from
the
bottom
of
the
glass
nose
has
some
smoked
bananas
wheat
and
a
touch
of
spice
that
the
smoke
has
overtaken
beautiful
smoked
woodmeats
in
true
schlenkerla
fashion
taste
has
a
faint
sourness
at
the
beginning
although
this
disappears
with
warmth
with
a
creamy
and
chewy
mouthfeel
initially
revealing
some
bananas
and
smoked
woodmalts
thins
out
as
it
moves
over
the
palate
leaving
behind
more
smoke
mouthfeel
starts
off
fuller
than
it
finishes
residual
smoke
on
the
palate
and
a
faint
sense
of
the
weizen
wouldve
loved
more
body
in
here
ala
weihenstephaner
overall
a
good
offering
if
a
bit
onedimensional
and
thin
at
times
gladly
have
this
with
cheese
crackers
and
nuts
at
thanksgiving
o
rauchbiers
are
a
favorite
style
of
mine
and
while
this
is
a
lighter
one
from
schlenkerla
its
still
a
very
good
beer
that
i
could
drink
all
night
long
worth
trying
if
you
ever
see
it
around
overall
it
was
nice
to
be
able
to
taste
some
other
flavors
in
a
rauchbier
easy
to
drink
the
smoke
flavor
was
complemented
well
by
the
other
tastes
i
would
have
this
one
again
o
feels
like
a
weizen
tastes
similar
and
yet
not
a
unique
beer
but
still
a
simple
perfectly
balanced
easily
enjoyable
and
drinkable
one
d
tasty
goes
down
easily
not
too
filling
mild
kick
good
representation
of
style
this
is
good
beer
to
drink
for
a
while
if
youre
in
the
mood
for
the
style
overall
i
like
this
version
better
than
the
bock
in
terms
of
drinkability
very
smooth
smoke
flavors
and
good
hefe
flavors
to
mingle
not
sure
if
this
is
an
old
bottle
id
like
to
try
it
on
tap
to
verify
actually
quite
redundent
to
figure
the
best
offering
from
this
brewery
as
they
are
all
different
and
strong
it
should
be
had
the
grade
is
irrelevant
i
personally
like
this
and
the
urbock
most
drinkability
in
terms
of
smokiness
weizen
plays
second
fiddle
to
its
märzen
brother
but
it
is
still
a
high
quality
brew
tons
of
complexity
and
flavor
the
beer
went
down
very
well
the
smokiness
combining
nicely
with
the
mild
bananavanilla
flavours
from
the
wheat
contents
not
sure
id
want
a
night
drinking
it
but
pleased
ive
had
one
visited
the
brewery
years
ago
but
didnt
have
one
of
these
overall
a
good
mild
rauchbier
a
good
introduction
to
the
style
this
would
be
especially
good
in
the
fall
pours
a
slightly
hazy
darkish
amber
with
very
nice
offwhite
head
the
head
seems
to
last
quite
awhile
and
even
lingers
toward
the
bottom
of
the
glass
smells
of
ham
light
pork
scent
of
bacon
basically
any
kind
of
smoke
cured
meat
you
can
think
of
i
cant
tire
of
the
aroma
from
this
beer
just
plain
awesome
theres
also
some
aromas
of
burnt
wood
kind
of
like
after
a
bonfire
finally
goes
out
reminds
me
of
a
summer
campfire
bbq
tastes
similar
to
taste
with
some
bitterness
towards
the
end
after
some
sweet
crystal
malt
character
light
in
mouthfeel
but
bitterness
is
rather
even
balanced
with
the
smoked
malts
overall
a
great
smoke
beer
i
would
believe
this
one
is
a
tad
lighter
in
smoke
character
than
some
of
the
brewerys
similar
offerings
this
one
goes
excellent
with
pork
chops
sauerkraut
yummy
o
a
really
complex
yet
easy
drinking
rauchbier
great
for
summer
bbq
o
the
flavor
is
good
but
not
quite
what
the
aroma
is
less
nuanced
great
beer
regardless
d
to
paraphrase
the
most
interesting
man
in
the
world
i
dont
often
drink
rauchbier
but
when
i
do
i
prefer
schlenkerla
schlenkerla
is
one
of
those
beers
that
qualifies
as
a
classic
of
classics
and
this
particular
one
is
as
good
as
it
gets
the
smoke
and
weizen
yeast
work
together
masterfully
and
the
malt
character
softens
everything
to
the
point
that
it
is
perfectly
drinkable
the
aroma
really
reminds
me
of
an
old
barbecue
restaurant
or
perhaps
more
appropriately
an
old
old
brewpub
with
decades
of
smooth
smoke
soaked
into
the
walls
an
excellent
beer
that
i
feel
lucky
to
be
drinking
drinkable
yet
i
think
i
enjoy
other
schlenkerla
smoke
brews
more
i
would
not
want
more
than
2
glasses
of
it
this
beer
pours
as
a
cloudy
looking
yellowish
gold
color
with
a
thin
white
head
the
smell
was
obviously
smokey
with
some
light
wheat
aromas
in
there
the
taste
was
smoked
as
well
but
the
wheat
seemed
to
mute
the
strength
of
it
the
mouthfeel
is
lighter
than
the
other
rauchs
this
brewery
puts
out
overall
its
a
decent
brew
but
the
smoked
brews
arent
really
my
thing
d
fantastic
beer
not
as
smokefilled
as
their
marzen
but
thats
okay
this
brew
is
a
different
sort
of
beast
and
a
tasty
one
at
that
highly
recommended
some
might
find
this
beer
a
little
bland
but
i
really
enjoyed
not
a
lot
of
body
or
insane
flavor
but
the
beer
is
crisp
and
has
a
great
aftertaste
very
sessionable
i
split
this
beer
with
zep9865
the
beer
poured
a
dark
dark
raisin
brown
in
color
with
a
two
finger
beige
colored
head
it
is
incredibly
murky
and
really
doesnt
let
any
light
pass
through
it
there
is
also
a
moderate
amount
of
sediment
on
the
bottom
it
certainly
wasnt
what
i
expected
the
aroma
is
really
only
of
smoked
malt
but
it
isnt
nearly
as
smoky
as
their
other
beers
and
when
smoke
is
the
main
aroma
you
cant
really
pick
up
anything
else
the
flavor
interestingly
enough
is
of
both
mild
yeast
and
lightly
smoked
malt
its
interesting
because
you
get
a
slight
watered
down
ham
flavor
paired
with
the
flavor
of
bread
after
its
been
dipped
in
pea
soup
its
interesting
to
say
the
least
and
the
more
i
think
about
it
the
more
i
get
that
pea
soup
flavor
it
drinks
alright
but
its
nothing
overly
appealing
its
just
kind
of
an
odd
pairing
i
just
cant
like
this
one
as
much
as
their
others
but
its
an
interesting
try
o
there
is
good
drinkability
here
it
goes
down
easy
and
tastes
great
overall
i
really
enjoyed
this
beer
it
is
less
smokey
than
the
others
i
have
had
but
i
think
it
is
a
great
more
mild
take
on
the
style
i
recommend
giving
this
a
try
and
i
look
forward
to
having
this
again
aecht
schlenkerla
weizen
is
a
pretty
clear
red
brown
beer
topped
with
a
fluffy
white
foam
that
has
outstanding
retention
and
lacing
it
has
a
very
smokey
aroma
like
pine
embers
its
medium
bodied
smooth
and
a
little
foamy
it
leaves
the
mouth
a
little
slick
smoke
is
the
dominant
flavor
theres
a
little
banana
underneath
wheat
flavor
comes
toward
the
end
of
the
taste
along
with
a
little
botanical
bitterness
it
seems
like
an
odd
style
to
smoke
but
it
works
pretty
well
its
a
very
distinct
flavor
o
probably
tastes
just
like
youd
except
a
german
wheat
with
prominent
smoke
flavor
i
think
the
combination
works
well
and
the
beer
still
ends
up
being
fairly
refreshing
notes
there
is
a
little
more
balance
to
the
weizen
compared
to
some
of
there
other
offerings
and
so
it
is
more
interesting
and
drinkable
for
my
taste
o
well
if
pressed
i
could
drink
this
no
problem
most
smoke
beers
turn
me
off
but
this
was
a
pleasant
surprise
t
beautiful
floral
and
wheat
taste
with
a
citrus
undertone
definitely
smokey
but
not
overly
carbonated
a
mildly
strong
alcohol
taste
to
it
great
great
blend
this
is
an
easy
one
to
rate
fantastic
for
the
style
not
the
one
to
try
first
if
it
is
your
first
attempt
at
the
style
this
is
very
direct
and
sharp
edged
a
realdeal
rauchbier
o
very
solid
a
true
mix
of
rauchbier
and
weizen
worth
a
pick
up
for
the
experience
this
is
okay
bit
its
not
really
i
think
very
enjoyable
its
a
tad
small
for
smell
and
classic
rauchbier
taste
but
it
doesnt
even
have
classic
wheat
beer
properties
or
flavor
or
even
body
its
almost
as
if
the
two
dont
work
together
and
cancel
out
properties
that
make
both
of
them
great
ill
pass
cheers
i
really
like
this
and
without
that
copperish
twang
on
the
end
itd
be
rated
higher
id
like
to
have
another
to
see
if
thats
unique
to
this
bottle
or
a
general
thing
another
great
rauchbier
from
schlenkerla
the
wheat
flavors
are
very
light
but
are
fantastic
when
they
show
through
d
nice
overall
the
smokiness
tends
to
fade
a
bit
as
you
drink
but
still
nice
the
beer
appears
a
hazy
dirty
yellow
hue
with
a
sizable
head
head
retention
is
good
and
plenty
of
lacing
is
visible
upon

the
aroma

schlenkerla
rauchbiers
are
the
benchmark
of
the
style
and
this
beer
is
no
exception
peat

scents

with

the
flavor
is
well

and
delicious
if
an

could
be
a
sessionable
beer
it
would
be
this
this
is
the
perfect
union
of
hefeweizen
and
smoke
beer
great
stuff
personally
i
dont
want
this
beer
often
but
with
ribs
smoked
meat
ribs
cheeses
you
just
cant
go
wrong
give
a
try
under
these
circumstances
after
many
minutes
and
nearly
half
way
through
the
heads
still
kickin
it
stellar

d
id
never
consider
this
style
a
session
beer
but
this
is
probably
as
easydrinking
as
rauchbier
comes
and
would
be
a
great
way
to
introduce
somebody
to
this
rare
yet
interesting
and
flavorful
style
a
great
brew
and
an
even
better
conversation
piece
drinkability
is

excellent
integration
between
the

and

the
aroma
is
baconlike
smokiness
masking
the
qualities
of
the
underlying
beer
although
bananaish

emerge
together
with

the
flavor
is
dominated
by
baconlike
smokiness
with
greasy
notes
and
burnt
wood
touch
rolled
in
wheat
perceived
as
bread
followed
by
low
hoppy
bitterness
towards
the
finish
which
is
quite
dry
due
to
the
moderate
carbonation
and

the
wheaty
texture
imparts
creamy
fullness
to
the

unfortunately
the
bananaish
sweetness
combined
with
bacon
is
quite
odd
and
reduces
the
the
drinkability

the
color

the

me
more

explaining
the

very
unusual
style
that
i
like
the
beer
came
in
a
0
5
liter
brown
stubby
bottle
which
feels
extremely
authentic
as
a
result
of
a
100
german
label
written
in
gothic
lettering
when
poured
into
a
lager
glass
the
wonderful
smoke
aroma
hits
you
at
an
arms
length
underneath
it
there
are
faint
notes
of
bananas
and
cloves
and
a
bit
of
orange
peel
it
is
a
very
handsome
beer
with
a
burnt
amber
cloudy
appearance
topped
off
with
a
tall
white
lasting
head
and
generous
lacing
worthy
of
its
weizen
heritage
the
taste
is
a
balance
of
fruity
esters
bananas
lemons
orange
peel
and
herbs
cloves
coriander
mixed
with
a
smoky
dryness
the
smoked
malt
is
a
bit
harsh
on
the
palette
and
the
beer
lacks
enough
body
to
temper
the
rough
edges
in
this
department
a
very
nice
smoky
detour
from
the
ordinary
beers
and
a
nostalgic
look
at
what
beers
might
have
tasted
like
prior
to
the
industrial
revolution
taking
over
the
malting
process
taste
is
smoky
but
not
as
overwhelming
as
you
would
expect
from
the
smell
hickory
smoke
offset
by
a
sweet
maltiness
eminating
from
the
wheat
lightly
salty
and
a
bit
sour
especially
in
the
finish
a
lightly
bitter
smokiness
in
the
finish
also
pretty
damn
drinkable
for
rauchbier
much
less
overpowering
than
their
marzen
for
example
a
must
try
if
you
can
find
it
pours
a
cloudy
dark
amber
with
an
off
white
foamy
head
there
seemed
to
be
a
big
amount
of
carbonation
from
the
bottom
of
the
glass
the
head
stayed
for
almost
the
duration
of
the
beer
and
there
was
a
fair
amount
of
lace
on
the
glass
the
smells
was
a
wonderfully
oaky
smoke
smell
that
was
not
overwhelming
but
actually
quite
pleasant
i
continuously
smelled
this
beer
as
i
drank
it
taste
was
slightly
sour
with
hints
of
smoke
at
the
end
wow
it
may
sound
strange
but
this
works
body
was
thin
to
medium
and
there
was
a
good
amount
of
carbonation
i
am
not
sure
if
this
is
very
drinkable
but
i
would
certainly
have
it
again
perhaps
with
some
type
of
sausage
murky
brown
hue
with
a
thin
white
head
quickly
becoming
a
ring
typical
intense
heller
aroma
roasted
pork
and
tons
of
smoked
ham
sweet
maple
syrup
campfire
just
rich
malt
altogether
and
intense
smokiness
it
somehow
reminds
vermont
maple
smoked
cheddars
which
is
no
little
task
taste
is
actually
quite
wheaty
and
fruity
banana
lemon
so
its
actually
pretty
well
made
since
it
was
clearly
the
intention
but
i
dont
really
enjoy
the
atmosphere
created
from
wheaty
dusty
tartness
mixed
with
the
big
smokiness
medium
bodied
very
carbonated
far
from
as
interesting
as
the
other
2
if
you
like
lapsang
souchong
give
this
a
try
a
unique
experience
but
a
brew
i
would
rarely
drink
unless
i
lived
in
bamburg
this
would
make
a
great
sauce
and
go
well
with
nachtwurst
and
coleslaw

a
bottle
i
also
have
to
say
that
this
brewers
website
is
first
rate
great
info
on
all
aspects
of
beer
production
especially
the
production
of
smoked
malt
also
great
pics
of
their
products
brownish
color
on
a
thick
head
the
smell
is
smoky
but
less
than
for
the
marzen
by
the
same
brewery
the
taste
is
clearly
cut
in
two
halfs
smoke
on
one
side
smoked
bacon
or
something
like
that
wheat
on
the
other
side
hops
arent
noticeable
the
beer
although
it
is
less
smoky
than
the
marzen
is
still
interesting
and
more
refeshing
leaves
a
clean
dry
feeling
on
the
palate
nice
but
less
extravagant
than
the
marzen
the
smoke
is
intense
though
noticeably
less
than
the
marzen
or
urbock
it
is
a
ruby
brown
with
a
big
head
it
has
a
sweet
smokey
aroma
with
some
fruit
in
the
nose
the
body
is
crisp
and
relatively
light
and
then
the
smoke
hits
you
it
finishes
fairly
clean
with
some
lingering
smokiness
i
love
this
with
ham
16
9oz
bottle
poured
into
a
weizen
glass
it
pours
a
murky
dark
brown
color
with
three
fingers
of
head
there
is
quite
a
bit
of
lacing
left
on
the
glass
the
smell
is
fairly
smoky
but
also
has
hints
of
wheat
malt
and
fruit
maybe
a
hint
of
cloves
in
there
as
well
the
taste
is
also
very
smoky
but
not
overly
strong
very
malty
and
like
smoked
gouda
going
across
the
tongue
a
little
bit
of
esters
and
a
slight
clove
flavor
from
the
yeast
as
well
almost
no
trace
of
hops
the
body
is
fairly
thick
and
heavy
good
for
a
weizen
the
drinkability
also
fairs
well
a
very
very
unique
wheat
beer
after
i
finished
the
beer
there
was
a
lingering
aftertaste
in
my
mouth
like
i
just
had
a
huge
dip
it
was
quite
enjoyable
my
spouse
who
does
like
wheats
was
less
impressed
saying
that
it
made
her
crave
smoked
fish
which
russians
like
to
eat
with
beer
anyway
shes
right
though
this
would
go
very
well
with
some
smoked
trout
starts
a
bit
tingly
and
it
then
quickly
smoothes
out
the
body
is
a
medium
plus
delicious
flavor
of
smoked
ham
it
reminds
me
of
holidays
at
my
grandparents
there
are
some
noticable
tastes
of
wheat
in
there
but
the
smokiness
really
dominates
this
is
a
very
interesting
style
it
is
not
quite
as
smoky
as
other
rauchbiere
but
it
definitely
has
plenty
of
flavor
the
drinkability
is
also
great
i
just
wanted
to
take
my
next
sip
time
after
time
appearance
the
body
is
a
cloudy
unfiltered
amber
brown
with
jets
of
carbonation
running
up
from
the
bottom
forming
a
large
creamy
textured
tan
head
beautiful
as
for
lacing
is
perfect
thick
and
spaced
evenly
aroma
its
just
about
brunch
here
and
i
figured
why
not
sample
a
beer
that
taste
liked
smoked
bacon
this
is
liquified
canadian
bacon
as
weird
as
that
sounds
its
kind
of
smells
good
underneath
the
layers
of
smoke
are
mild
clove
and
fruit
esters
and
a
sharp
scent
of
malted
wheat
taste
sharp
sweetness
of
a
wheat
the
fizzy
high
carbonation
and
the
neverending
barrage
of
smokiness
that
shouldnt
even
be
drinkable
but
somehow
you
get
used
to
it
after
your
second
sip
mouthfeel
spritzy
medium
bodied
smoked
wheat
wow
this
beer
is
different
drinkability
just
cant
imagine
drinking
multiple
offerings
of
this
in
one
sitting
that
would
be
a
bit
much
but
the
taste
is
shocking
unexpected
for
me
at
any
level
for
me
the
smoked
meatlike
taste
not
a
bad
one
at
all
and
worth
repeating
is
unlike
any
other
beer
ive
ever
tried
and
it
pleases
me
to
have
been
introduced
into
this
new
rauchbier
style
the
mouthfeel
is
thick
but
nice
et
all
the
drinkability
is
good
as
long
as
your
budget
allows
this
rare
specimen
here
in
paris
overall
just
another
outstanding
beer
from
this
brewery
the
wheat
touch
throws
me
off
a
little
but
it
is
a
weizen
after
all
not
the
beer
for
everyone
but
if
you
like
smokey
beers
this
is
a
must
try
the
weizen
has
a
hint
of
smoke
to
itwhich
may
have
been
stronger
but
i
just
drank
their
märzen
the
beer
was
quite
dark
in
fact
much
darker
than
even
your
standard
dunkel
weiss
the
beer
had
a
good
deal
of
a
caramel
taste
to
it
with
not
as
much
of
the
clovey
banana
flavor
one
associates
with
a
weizen
you
really
ought
to
try
this
one
it
must
be
one
of
the
beer
communitys
best
kept
secrets
muddy
colour
typical
of
a
dunkel
weizen
with
foam
not
very
compact
and
persistent
for
a
weizen
beer
the
smell
is
smoke
smoke
and
smoke
the
smoked
flavour
of
a
scamorza
italian
smoked
cheese
smoke
of
green
wood
the
typical
flavour
of
a
weizen
is
still
present
even
if
a
little
difficult
to
feel
in
the
abundancy
of
the
smoke
at
the
taste
the
smoke
is
less
predominant
and
the
weizen
feeling
is
more
perceptible
with
a
little
of
citric
lime
aftertaste
of
smoke
ma
vaunbalanced
nice
dark
colored
wheat
beer
with
thick
head
head
looked
like
a
sponge
through
the
side
of
the
glass
with
its
large
bubbles
nice
beachwood
smoked
malt
flavor
with
emphasis
on
wheat
and
smoke
flavor
overall
a
great
smoked
wheat
but
i
think
i
like
the
rauchenfelser
slightly
better
with
the
addition
of
hop
extract
which
gives
it
a
little
more
character
this
is
a
quality
beer
but
just
not
to
my
liking
i
really
enjoy
how
the
smoke
flavor
accents
alaskan
smoked
porter
and
stone
smoked
porter
but
i
got
a
whole
different
vibe
from
this
beer
im
obviously
not
as
into
the
smoke
flavor
as
some
bas
rauchbier
weiss
beer
a
weiss
smoke
beer
brown
in
color
and
definitely
smoky
in
the
aroma
very
little
head
what
there
was
dissipated
quickly
wow
i
do
not
get
this
whole
smoke
beer
concept
it
tastes
like
an
arson
investigation
consequently
i
swirled
the
yeast
at
the
bottom
and
added
it
to
the
glass
thats
better
it
went
from
a
felony
to
an
aggravated
misdemeanor
really
bad
pour
is
a
cloudy
medium
brown
with
a
huge
white

with
some

with
the
banana
becoming

towards
the
end
body
is

some
pretty
strong
carbonation
this
beers
pours
a
hazy
copper
color
with
a
creamy
head
that
last
for
a
little
while
the
smell
of
smoked
is
very
very
strong
and
tastes
the
same
beef
jerky
lovers
beer
the
smoked
flavor
does
not
last
very
long
as
an
after
taste
which
is
good
this
by
far
is
the
best
rauchbier
i
have
ever
had
i
plan
on
brewing
it
my
self
pours
a
murky
light
brown
with
a
thick
white
head
smells
like
a
smoky
wheat
beer
with
clove
dominating
the
wheat
i
have
to
admit
that
at
first
the
smell
seemed
intensethis
has
been
a
totally
different
beer
experience
for
me
i
have
never
tasted
a
beer
quite
like
this
truly
an
enjoyable
beer
strong
flavors
and
intense
smokiness
one
hearty
beer
notes
drinkability
i
just
love
a
good
rauchbier
and
this
is
one
of
the
best
it
combines
the
pleasantries
of
a
tasty
wheat
beer
with
old
school
flavours
to
create
one
helluva
an
exceptional
brew
notes
a
simple
yet
deep
smoked
brew
quite
drinkable
and
pairs
best
with
lighter
dishes
like
apple
wood
smoke
chicken
or
a
mildly
smoked
pork
shoulder
laced
with
bbq
sauce
this
beauty
pours
with
a
nice
healthy
beige
colored
head
that
settles
atop
effervescent
reddishbrown
liquid
turning
a
bit
murky
once
the
residual
yeast
sediment
is
swirledpoured
into
the
glass
nose
ahh
the
nose
light
wheat
malts
enrobed
in
a
blanket
of
wonderful
smokiness
very
appetizing
to
all
the
senses
tasting
reveals
the
light
body
from
the
proportion
of
malted
wheat
used
then
wave
upon
wave
of
wonderful
smoke
flavors
coat
the
palate
a
very
subtle
hop
presence
is
tasted
after
swallowing
finishes
smoky
then
the
traditional
weizenbier
flavors
banana
clove
make
a
brief
apperance
but
the
finish
is
not
as
intense
or
as
long
as
in
the
marzen
urbock
but
is
still
a
wonder
to
behold
a
nice
less
inyourface
introduction
to
the
style
truly
one
of
the
worlds
most
distinctive
beers
a
musttry
brown
in
color
with
a
dull
mahogany
glow
when
held
to
the
light
you
can
see
the
effervescence
thats
present
as
billows
of
tiny
bubbles
rise
to
the
surface
supporting
a
thick
creamy
ivory
head
the
head
holds
extremely
well
throughout
the
glass
but
leaves
little
lace
the
body
is
medium
with
a
very
fine
and
effervescent
carbonation
that
gives
a
creamy
mouthfeel
the
aroma
is
outstanding
with
a
very
rich
deep
beechwood
smokiness
the
flavor
starts
with
a
lightly
sweet
fruity
and
gently
tangy
maltiness
that
reveals
some
soft
caramel
notes
as
it
warms
in
the
mouth
and
then
a
burst
of
soft
smokiness
immediately
following
the
swallow
the
smokiness
lingers
for
a
few
moments
and
then
receeds
at
least
partially
from
the
palate
at
this
point
much
of
the
yeast
character
is
noticeable
with
a
gentle
clove
that
works
extremely
well
with
the
residual
smoke
character
as
well
as
some
vanilla
very
light
banana
and
soft
phenolic
plastic
very
nice
the
smoke
character
is
extremely
well
done
never
overwhelming
the
palate
but
with
enough
presence
to
be
continually
noticeable
throughout
the
entire
serving
absolutely
worth
trying
brownish
orange
and
hazy
this
beer
sported
a
fluffy
offwhite
head
with
of
whiff
of
this
nobdy
could
ever
mistake
this
beer
for
a
nonsmoke
one
bigtime
smoke
aroma
as
well
as
a
little
malt
there
was
still
immense
smoke
taste
but
it
wasnt
as
big
as
in
the
nose
i
tasted
the
hearty
wood
smoke
first
followed
by
mild
wheat
characteristics
mainly
the
body
and
mouthfeel
and
the
beer
departed
with
a
slight
hop
bitterness
it
tasted
a
little
like
hickory
smoke
but
ive
been
told
otherwise
it
was
much
more
balanced
beer
than
one
would
expect
from
smell
alone
a
great
beer
for
for
when
youre
in
the
mood
for
something
a
little
differnet
its
also
fun
to
introduce
others
to
a
world
beyond
bud
with
this
one
cheers
to
venom
for
the
sample
this
beer
is
a
murky
brownorangeamber
in
color
a
big
fluffy
beige
head
sits
on
top
and
sticks
around
for
a
while
huge
smoke
on
the
nose
of
this
one
similar
to
a
campfire
what
a
conglomeration
of
various
tastes
on
the
buds
very
interesting
indeed
this
beer
may
not
be
right
for
everybody
but
it
is
growing
on
me
first
there
is
of
course
the
smoke
flavor
fairly
heavy
but
also
rounded
then
there
are
the
weizen
characteristics
banana
cloves
vanilla
phenolic
character
and
pepper
body
is
about
medium
and
the
carbonation
is
just
about
right
nice
mouthfeel
unique
beer
worth
a
try
interesting
experience
ive
has
peatsmoked
beers
before
but
using
wood
to
smoke
the
malt
makes
for
such
a
higher
quality
flavor
and
aroma
its
got
a
good
estery
dunkel
weizen
flavor
going
on
underneath
the
smoke
too
the
way
the
smoke
and
ester
flavors
combine
iss
like
it
almost
creates
a
feel
of
creamed
smoke
more
than
a
new
flavor
it
went
well
with
my
wifes
first
attempt
at
a
pot
roast
and
i
can
only
imagine
how
much
better
it
would
go
with
grilled
or
smoked
pork
or
beef
the
turbid
dark
bronze
hued
brew
is
topped
by
a
dense
very
well
retained
ivory
white
head
with
stiff

peaks

lingering
flavorful
to

although
the
rauchmalt
overpowered
many
basemalt

esters
were
still
discernible
the
combination
of
smoke
and
typical
weizen
characteristics
result
in
a
very
unique
and
highly
drinkable
rauchbier
provided
that
youre
accustomed

rauchmalt
liked
it
a

very
nice
smoky

flavour
mixed
in
with
a
slightly
tart
flavour
character
in
weissbiers
not
as
thick
and
flavoursome
as
the
marzen
but
still
very
good
i
did
like
the
marzen
a
bit
better
but
the
wheat
is
much
lighter
and
suitable
for
summer
spicy
orange
and
clove

also
make
a
great
beer

something
different
but
a
winner
in
my
book
i
mean
its
the
strangest
beer
ever
its
pure
smoked
meat
on
the
nose
and
the
taste
is
salty
smokey
dark
german
ale
very
odd
overall
what
a
great
beer
gotta
try
this
one
with
some
good
bbq
cant
imagine
it
could
get
much
better
than
that
overall
i
used
to
think
all
rauchbiers
tasted
like
campfires
but
my
palate
has
shifted
and
i
must
say
i
love
this
beer
4

smooth
almost

just
enough

at
the

this
beer
is
very
good
and
one
of
my
favorite
smoked
beers
but
one
of
myfavorites
in
general
o
i
like
to
imagine
myself
having
one
of
these
in
a
wooden
stein
as
i
sit
in
front
of
a
roaring
fireplace
in
an
old
world
tavern
rich
decadent
and
meaty
this
is
the
perfect
cold

beer
and
a
perfect
companion
for
bbq
and
smoked
meat

first
example
of
a
rauchbier

will
be
searching
out
more
examples
of
the

the

sitting
at

table

watching
the
tourists
come
and
go
in
a
great
rush
as
a
sidenote
i
gave
a

to
my
friend
who
doesnt
usually
venture
away
from
pale
lager
his
first
reaction
was
wow
it
tastes
of
bacon
he
seemed
to
like
it
though
so
take
from
that
what
you
will
personally
i
really
enjoyed
it
although
the
powerful
flavour
would
make
it
difficult
to
get
through
much
more
than
half
a
pint

one
sitting

hits
your

i
can
understand
how
it
would
be
a
turn
off
but
for
me
it
worked
the
taste
was
surprisingly
malty
and
sweet
however
the
finish
has
a
bitter
dry
and
smoky
finish
which
lingers
in
your
taste
buds
a
very
robust
full
bodied
and
filling
beer
one
is
quite
enough
overall
i
would
have
this
one
once
in
a
while
and
with
a
hearty
meaty
meal
im
glad
i
tried
it
and
i
hope
to
get
to
know
more
of
this
style
smoke
beer
not
my
thing

had

smoke
more
pronounced

but
i
am
not
sure
how
old
the
keg
is
likely
not
a
popular
beer
at
the
location
i
was
having
it
will
keep
my
review
as
is
this
is
a
great
smoky
beer
very
drinkable
beers
like
this
remind
me
that
i
need
more
imports
a
perfectly
integrated
rauchbier
this
is
truly
how
the
masters
of
the
style
integrate
such
pronounced
flavors
into
an
almost
delicate
and
certainly
delectable
beer
really
really
fantastic
if
i
rated
this
only
to
style
it
might
earn
5
0s
across
the
board
i
prefer
the
märzen
over
this
without
question
its
lighter
on
the
palate
and
more
drinkable
my
least
favorite
so
far
from
a
brewery
with
otherwise
world
class
beers
great
with
spicy
lamb
pizza
this
beer
pours
a
beige
fine
thick
stable
foam
and
a
dark
brown
body
smell
is
smoke
taste
is
smoke
as
well
but
with
a
great
malty
backbone
it
is
like
eating
smoked
pork
on
a
slice
of
bread
even
better
if
you
combine
with
pork
if
you
dig
smoke
in
your
beer
and
like
malt
it
doesnt
get
better
than
this
one
wow
the
appearance
isnt
particularly
special
but
everything
else
is
the
smoky
aroma
fills
my
nose
with
subtly
sweet
accents
the
smoke
isnt
overpowering
but
it
is
very
present
the
flavor
is
led
by
the
wonderful
liquid
smoke
which
just
seeps
into
my
mouth
layered
throughout
is
that
subtle
sweetness
which
is
mostly
present
on
the
back
end
very
low
bitterness
given
the
flavors
it
is
also
incredibly
clean
and
drinkable
silky
smooth
and
delicious
not
quite
sure
what
this
beer
is
lacking
to
make
it

slightly
more
carbonation
and
more
body
and
texture
the
superb
flavor
profile
is
even
more
outstanding
in
that
it
obtains
a
higher
degree
of
balance
by
being
slightly
sweeter
and
coats
the
tongue
with
a
slick
layer
of
bacon
like
smoke
the
flavor
profile
is
a
masterpiece
of
intensity
balance
and
complexity
the
delicious
smoke
character
is
always
present
but
never
overpowering
it

with
a
campfire
bacon
like
smoke
over
a
moderately
sweet
background
that
has
dark

characteristics
the
middle
allows
the
hops
to
impart
a
low
level
bitterness
that
has
a
citric
note
as
it
effervesces
the
finish
is
less
dry
than
the
marzen
somewhat
crisp
slightly
sweet
and
leaves
you
with
a
touch
of
dark
fruit
and
a
lingering
smokiness
as
if
youve
sitting
around
a
campfire
world
class
and
ever
so
slightly
better
than
the
marzen
variant
ok
i
hate
to
even
review
this
because
it
may
be
well
crafted
it
may
be
the
best
rauch
beer
you
could
buy
but
its
not
for
me
holy
terrible
solution
put
the
smoked
ribs
in
a
blender
and
add
beer
no
mess
6
the
perfect
beer
to
drink
with
a
blt
food
match
i
couldnt
help
but
think
that
the
entire
menu
of
a
bavarian
pub
would
work
with
this
especially
anything
pork
related
if
you
see
schinken
on
the
menu
get
it
i
bought
this
one
to
make
some
sauce
the
ribs
im
making
and
i
think
ill
need
to
grab
another
bottle
to
eat
with
them
the
quintessential
rauchbier
mild
smoke
in
the
nose
with
a
nice
malty
character
starts
off
with
a
nice
toffee
flavor
that
is
quickly
usurped
by
the
smokiness
and
man
is
it
smoky
mild
hops
bitterness
on
the
finish
barely
noticeable
through
the
smoke
very
nice
thecuriograph
com
picked
this
up
with
hesitation
as
i
had
yet
not
had
a
rauchbier
i
liked
this
was
the
gamechanger
pours
a
deep
rich
mahogany
with
a
onefinger
or
so
head
deep
smokiness
in
the
nose
which
corresponds
to
the
flavor
like
delicious
slowsmoked
pork
with
just
a
hint
of
malty
sweetness
a
bit
effervescent
on
the
tongue
almost
overwhelming
the
taste
profile
but
overall
very
very
good
overall
this
is
a
magnificent
beer
i
was
truly
impressed
with
how
the
malts
and
smoke
complimented
each
other
in
this
beer
rather
than
the
smoke
being
overpowering
or
playing
second
fiddle
to
a
sweet
bock
beer
both
flavor
elements
combined
in
a
truly
masterful
brew
the
abv
on
this
one
isnt
too
high
at
only
6
6
but
if
you
like
a
rauchbier
this
one
will
really
sneak
up
on
you
since
it
is
so
smooth
and
easy
to
drink
a
must
try
this
is
hard
to
describe
but
its
well
worth
tasting
the
intense
smoked
malt
is
everpresent
but
its
a
good
example
of
how
a
crazy
flavor
can
work
in
a
beer
not
expensive
from
the
500
ml
bottle
purchased
at
bottleworks
in
the
wallingford
neighborhood
of
seattle
the
uniqueness
factor
wouldnt
have
me
drinking
this
often
but
when
i
do
it
will
easily
be
enjoyed
like
many
a
good
german
beer
this
beer
is
complex
creamy
with
low
to
medium
carbonation
a
smooth
finish
and
very
clean
the
beer
is
like
a
camping
trip
or
a
thanksgiving
ham
in
a
bottle
whats
especially
impressive
about
urbock
is
that
despite
its
dominant
smoke
flavors
it
doesnt
send
me
into
smokey
bacon
and
barbecued
meats
land
sure
those
flavors
are
present
but
theres
a
sophistication
in
this
beers
flavor
profile
that
is
absent
from
any
of
the
other
smoked
beers
ive
tasted
in
this
style
i
think
that
the
malty
backbone
of
the
duppelbock
style
deserves
some
of
the
credit
but
most
of
it
goes
to
the
brewers
at
aecht
schlenkerla
who
have
produced
something
special
here
been
looking
forward
to
this
beer
for
a
long
time
pours
a
bark
root
beer
brown
with
a
big
foamy
tan
head
that
recedes
to
a
14
inch
cap
aroma
is
alder
smoke
big
time
over
a
mild
beery
underpinning
smooth
going
down
the
adler
smoke
is
not
as
evident
in
the
taste
as
the
aroma
but
very
very
nice
indeed
mixed
perfectly
with
a
caramelly
malt
and
tiny
grassy
hop
flavor
eminently
drinkable
the
16
9
oz
is
disappearing
quickly
spectacular
with
pork
love
a
good
rauchbier
and
this
one
is
up
there
with
the
best
while
heavily
smoked
there
is
still
some
finesse
love
schlenkerla
bier
uber
alles
this
does
seem
to
have
a
bit
of
a
lighter
boozelifted
essence
that
is
at
once
reminiscent
of
bocks
and
actively
burning
beechwood
fires
still
one
hell
of
a
sturdy
gritty
and
of
course
eye
and
palatewatering
smoky
deal
veritable
truth
in
advertising
that
cannot
be
denied
and
if
there
was
any
homeland
beer
that
rammstein
should
hold
close
to
heart
it
would
be
this
sorry
beer
peeps
i
just
dont
get
the
smoke
beerthing
looked
nice
a
dark
brown
with
a
small
head
aroma
was
a
sweet
and
potent
smokiness
i
gave
it
the
benefit
of
the
doubt
as
i
really
like
smoked
meats
in
general
unfortunately
the
smoke
flavor
was
just
too
much
for
me
i
definitely
dont
want
it
as
part
of
my
beer
i
get
that
a
lot
of
people
might
enjoy
these
not
me
looked
like
a
decent
beer
mouthfeel
was
pleasant
but
that
overpowering
smokiness
was
just
a
killer
good
smoke
beer
but
to
me
it
doesnt
stand
up
to
the
maerzen
now
patiently
awaiting
the
1
december
release
of
the
oak
smoke
overall
this
is
a
damned
fine
beer
and
i
just
loved
it
i
will
definitely
be
buying
more
of
this
one
o
i
like
this
beer
i
would
drink
it
again
this
is
a
must
try
if
you
like
smoked
rauchbier
unbelievably
spectacular
this
beer
has
a
wonderful
smokiness
that
is
truly
unique
the
taste
hits
you
with
hints
of
wood
caramel
and
bacon
this
is
a
medium
bodies
beer
that
has
a
smooth
feel
and
is
very
easy
to
drink
i
loved
this
beer
and
it
has
become
a
new
favorite
of
mine
beer
is
medium
to
mediumheavy
in
body
with
carbonation
of
mediumlow
intensity
resulting
in
a
mouthfeel
that
is
lightly
foamy
13
and
smooth
23
a
bit
more
carbonation
would
be
ideal
but
this
is
still
quite
good
for
the
smooth
smoky
flavors
embodied
in
this
particular
lager
and
the
style
in
general
closes
dry
with
heavy
stickiness
lingering
on
the
palate
and
lips
overall
an
extremely
smoky
rauchbier
that
is
bound
to
turn
off
many
but
should
be
experienced
just
for
the
experience
if
i
were
on
a
liquid
diet
and
was
craving
barbecue
id
stock
up
on
this
stuff
the
best
schlenkerla
and
also
the
last
one
that
i
needed
to
try
oa

intensely
smoky
so
much
so
that
i
can
smell
the
smoke
emanating
from
the
glass
112
feet
away
from
me
as
i
jot
down
the
tasting
notes
the
taste
is
wonderfully
smoky
sweet
pungent
with
excellent
mouthfeel
not
much
in
the
way
of
hoppiness
here
but
when
theres
this
much
flavor
packed
into
a
beer
like
this
its
hardly
missed
finishes
long
with
huge
notes
of
smokiness
with
sweet
malts
coming
in
behind
just
a
fantastic
example
of
the
brewers
art
here
for
the
novice
try
it
if
you
dont
like
it
try
it
again
it
may
take
3
or
4
bottles
but
once
you
acquire
the
taste
its
nothing
short
of
one
of
the
greatest
drinking
experiences
youll
ever
have
for
anyone
else
who
is
apprehensive
about
them
this
is
an
excellent
one
to
try
the
style
with
overall
lightly
sweetened
bbq
taste
in
a
glass
here
roasted
smoked
with
a
bit
of
char
sweet
and
delicious
pours
a
translucent
clear
mahogany
color
with
a
voluminous
bone
colored
head
excellent
lacing
through
out
the
drinking
left
on
the
sides
of
the
glass
for
the
aroma
i
picked
up
some
fruit
esters
underneath
the
wonderful
charred
wood
scents
after
a
taste
i
found
it
to
be
similar
to
that
of
smoked
gouda
cheese
meat
some
hoppiness
with
a
soft
bready
finish
very
complex
something
about
the
mouth
feel
reminded
me
of
a
menthol
cigarette
nice
and
light
bodied
for
the
seasoned
connoisseur
of
smoked
beer
plenty
of
others
have
already
pontificated
long
and
hard
about
this
fine
brew
i
agree
with
most
of
them
that
scored
it
high
and
liked
it
appearance
dark
caramel
with
a
light
beige
head
the
strong
smell
bacon
hits
you
immediately
like
fatback
bacon
frying
over
an
open
campfire
with
hickory
smoke
in
the
air
taste
follows
the
smell
but
surprisingly
not
as
strong
like
liquid
smoke
smooth
for
such
a
complex
beer
full
bodied
with
medium
carbonation
this
is
an
intense
beer
that
takes
you
to
the
edge
without
going
over
ill
definitely
try
this
again
but
next
time
with
a
nice
serving
of
bbqd
baby
back
ribs
anyways
not
as
dry
on
the
end
still
damn
good
overall
if
youve
ever
been
curious
about
smoked
beer

im
lucky
enough
to
have
3
craft
been
bars
here
that
have
thousands
of
beers
between
their
coolers
and
taps
and
a
beer
store
with
several
hundred
beers
as
well
ive
tried
countless
beers
over
the
years
and
come
to
love
a
handful
that
id
recommend
to
anyone
o
i
am
convinced
that
schlenkerla
is
starting
to
spoil
me
with
their
rauchbiers
take
it
from
a
man
who
normally
dislikes
bacon
this
is
excellent
overall
a
fun
beer
with
some
interesting
charachteristics
the
marzen
version
was
similar
but
i
thought
it
was
better
the
urbock
seemed
a
little
light
overall
which
let
some
more
agressive
notes
comes
through
in
the
taste
and
finish
certainly
unique
i
had
all
three
smoke
variations
at
a
recent
testing
and
this
is
the
one
that
stood
out
the
most
as
with
all
three
schlenkerla
smoke
beers
the
rich
smokey
aroma
is
something
close
to
heaven
the
dark
color
gives
us
americans
visions
of
barbecue
but
that
is
not
where
the
taste
goes
smooth
milk
chocolate
and
caramel
set
off
this
urbock
if
you
search
the
smoothness
may
even
tell
your
brain
that
vanilla
is
present
with
the
smoke
as
its
backbone
it
creates
an
interesting
mix
a
smokey
caramel
taste
continues
into
the
aftertaste
which
lingers
because
of
a
mildly
thick
mouthfeel
smoke
beers
are
not
for
everybody
but
there
is
little
doubt
who
makes
the
best
this
is
their
best
offering
note
pairs
very
well
with
a
robust
highquality
cigar
tastesmoked
malt
liquid
smoke
caramel
honey
ham
charred
beechwood
a
bit
of
a
dry
finish
and
all
wonderfully
balanced
strong
flavors
not
for
everyone
but
classically
crafted
and
a
great
match
for
smoked
or
bbqd
meats
or
just
to
sip
slowly
on
a
cool
night
by
a
warm
fire
poured
into
a
glass
mug
pours
dark
brown
with
a
light
tan
head
there
is
some
visible
ruby
colored
light
visible
along
the
edges
of
the
glass
the
head
retains
very
well
the
smoked
malt
hits
the
nose
right
up

and
its
quite
prominent
its
that
nice
campfire
smell
and

the

this
is
a
most
excellent
beer
if
youre
looking
for
a
smoked
beer
to
try
look
no
further
im
not
a
huge
fan
of
smoked
beers
but
im
starting
to
think
that
maybe
its
because
i
havent
had
the
right
ones
yet
the
smoked
flavor
was
clearly
present
and
on
the
forefront
however
it
was
not
so
strong
that
the
beer
was
harsh
or
undrinkable
great
balance
mouthfeel
is
a
bit
deceiving
until
you
remember
that
such
a
rich
and
powerful
aroma
is
coming
from
a
6
6
abv
beer
its
rather
light
but
creamy
enough
to
be
enjoyable
overall
how
could
you
top
this
beer
not
sure
its
possible
as
this
one
pretty
much
defines
the
style
american
craft
beer
drinkers
are
used
to
getting
this
much
flavor
and
aroma
from
their
big
bold
stouts
and
barley
wines
but
lets
not
forget
even
in
a
modest
6
6
package
you
can
be
blown
out
of
this
world
wish
it
were
cheaper
than
5
could
drink
this
often
pours
a
super
dark
brown
with
pure
ruby
highlights
when
held
up
to
the
light
thin
creamy
tan
head
aromas
hint
of
bbq
and
some
brown
sugar
taste
begins
with
a
smoky
molassas
then
an
ashy
charcoal
middle
and
an
earthy
creamy
finish
mouthfeel
is
rich
perfect
overall
an
amazing
beer
i
love
the
smoke
component
this
is
probably
closer
to
the
taste
of
beers
of
centuries
past
than
other
modern
interpretations
overall
a
great
beer
very
original
and
tasty
i
dont
think
it
was
quite
as
good
as
the
marzen
but
still
worth
looking
out
again

this
is
the
beer
that
introduced
me
to
rauchbiers
thanks
schlenkerla
very
nice
but
without
the
meaty
complexity
sophistication
and
seemingly
gentle
force
of
the
doppelbock
o
overall
i
would
rate
this
beer
higher
in
the
taste
and
overall
enjoyment
categories
if
it
had
just
a
touch
of
sweetness
from
malt
as
a
good
bock
will
have
as
it
is
this
is
classic
franconian
rauchbier
for
anyone
looking
to
sample
the
style
some
call
it
an
acquired
taste
but
brauerei
heller
keeps
the
smokiness
mellow
and
tasty
without
hitting
you
over
the
head
flavor
is
naturally
very
much
smoke
with
some
nicely
charred
wood
in
there
too
its
a
rich
and
strong
flavor
profile
and
will
instantly
drive
anyone
away
who
doesnt
already
love
smoked
foods
for
me
this
is
absolutely
a
treat
and
a
beer
i
wish
i
could
get
easier
around
here
will
be
drinking
more
of
these
in
the
future
as
soon
as
i
can
get
my
hands
on
them
overall
not
nearly
as
smoke
dominant
as
most
rauchbiers
ive
tried
this
bottle
has
been
in
the
fridge
a
couple
years
so
it
may
have
mellowed
worth
a
try
overall
this
is
quite
a
fine
rauchbier
it
feels
strangely
anachronistic
because
its
oldworld
suggestions
stand
out
against
modernday
america
it
brings
to
mind
a
bygone
time
recommended
to
all
dark
beer
lovers
or
anyone
seeking
something
a
little
bit
different
prost
o
a
very
interesting
beer
i
could
see
this
being
very
good
with
some
good
meats
or
cheese
not
sure
i
would
drink
this
on
its
own
again
ever
again
though
it
is
very
intense
and
almost
overpowering
at
first
but
moves
into
being
very
drinkable
after
the
first
few
sips
a
very
solid
beer
o
an
interesting
beer
glad
i
picked
one
up
would
go
great
with
smoked
meats
6
a
500ml
an
easy
drinking
comfortable
beer
suitable
for
winding

way

i
wouldnt
try
this
again
but
i
was
glad
to
experience
o
this
is
the
second
of
these
smokebeers
ive
tried
and
they
just
get
better
and
better
the
best
part
about
these
are
the
amazing
nose
and
the
nostalgia
it
brings
back
good
memories
of
camping
all
summer
long
in
oregon
overall
im
deriving
a
lot
of
enjoyment
from
drinking
this
beer
i
feel
like
i
could
drink
a
ton
of
it
and
not
get
tired
of
it
there
are
so
few
really
good
smoked
beers
out
there
ill
take
this
whenever
i
can
get
it
o
this
stuff
is
delicious
o
most
probably
wouldnt
like
this
but
its
still
well
made
this
is
something
i
could
enjoy
on
occasion
its
different
but
still
pretty
good
in
its
own
way
reminds
me
a
lot
of
the
country
outings
im
accustomed
to
during
summer
and
autumn
some
may
not
like
this
but
i
do
and
i
appreciate
its
quality
as
well
as
the
class
brauerei
heller
possess
o
no
alcohol
can
be
observed
in
either
the
smell
or
the
taste
which
makes
this
beer
easier
to
drink
due
to
the
intensity
of
the
smell
im
not
sure
i
could
drink
more
than
one
of
these
in
an
evening
but
it
is
a
beer
i
definitely
enjoy
the
smell
really
reminds
me
of
a
good
bbq
pit
o
as
is
the
case
with
all
of
aecht
beers
youll
either
like
them
or
not
this
is
a
pretty
solid
drinkable
beer
o
a
very
interesting
style
it
is
more
drinkable
than
i
remember
ill
use
this
as
a
measuring
stick
for
craft
interpretations
of
the
style
very
drinkable
daydreaming
of
its
fresh
excellence
o
good
beer
paired
with
bas
brown
ale
beef
and
barley
soup
recipe
and
it
was
a
damn
fine
pairing
it
has
a
very
smokey
aroma
almost
like
i
was
near
a
bbq
because
there
was
a
slight
sweet
smell
its
head
is
a
light
brown
with
decent
head
retention
and
nice
lacing
down
the
glass
the
beer
itself
was
brown
and
murky
but
yet
it
was
still
enticing
as
for
the
taste
it
starts
upfront
very
smoky
and
ends
with
a
slightly
burnt
taste
i
had
a
medium
mouthfeel
and
the
smokiness
would
not
stick
around
forever
overall
a
good
beer
and
i
would
also
like
to
experiment
cooking
with
it
o
i
enjoyed
this
a
lot
more
than
i
thought
i
would
as
i
usually
am
not
a
big
fan
of
smokebased
beers
this
beer
though
presents
additional
character
that
accents
the
smoke
and
provides
a
unique
flavor
experience
locally
they
would
become
a
staple
overall
glad
i
tried
it
before
this
i
had
never
had
a
rauchbier
and
always
wanted
to
try
one
i
prob
wouldnt
spend
the
money
on
this
one
again
but
its
one
id
reccomend
having
under
your
belt
overall
i
really
enjoyed
this
beer
as
i
can
get
a
few
smoke
beers
here
in
slc
but
not
many
the
smoke
beer
style
is
a
take
it
or
leave
it
for
a
most
people
i
would
think
if
you
have
an
adventurous
friend
they
may
enjoy
sharing
this
beer
i
do
enjoy
the
style
although
one
is
enough
a
first
rate
rauchbier
this
is
what
all
other
smoke
beers
should
aspire
to
smokey
and
smooth
with
loads
of
sweet
malt
i
really
enjoyed
the
smoke
meat
presence
well
worth
seeking
out
if
you
enjoy
smoke
beers
or
are
just
looking
for
a
change
of
pace
pours
a
crystal
clear
dark
brown
with
a
2
inch
foamy
tan
head
that
settles
to
a
film
on
the
top
of
the
beer
thin
clumps
and
streaks
of
lace
cling
to
the
glass
on
the
drink
down
smell
is
all
about
the
smoke
but
in
a
more
subtle
was
than
the
marzen
smoked
meat
smoked
cheese
campfire
etc
i
am
getting
a
slight
whiff
of
malt
if
i
search
for
it
taste
is
also
of
the
aforementioned
smoked
items
with
a
nice
sweet
malt
that
supports
everything
the
smoke
flavors
arent
as
powerful
in
the
aftertaste
compared
to
the
marzen
leaving
more
of
a
sweet
and
subtle
roast
flavor
this
beer
has
a
nice
mouthfeel
with
a
solid
body
and
a
crisp
amount
of
carbonation
overall
this
is
a
very
good
rauchbier
and
hands
down
my
favorite
of
the
schlenkerla
beers
i
have
tried
thus
far
o
i
think
this
beer
would
be
a
great
pairing
at
a
barbecue
but
it
also
does
very
well
on
its
own
i
was
a
little
apprehensive
when
i
first
smelled
it
but
it
tastes
pretty
damn
good
o
this
was
a
very
unique
beer
i
loved
how
overpowering
the
smoke
was
but
beneath
it
was
a
the
complexity
of
a
bock
might
drink
again
for
a
bock
not
my
favorite
style
i
definitely
like
this
the
smokiness
is
present
but
not
overpowering
and
the
alcohol
is
well
hidden
im
not
sure
i
can
say
this
is
my
favorite
of
their
rauchbiers
but
this
is
good
and
worth
having
if
you
like
bock
it
might
be
an
interesting
take
on
the
style
to
add
some
smokiness
poured
deep
dark
brown
creamy
tight
little
head
and
some
very
decent
lacing
much
nicer
than
what
i
usually
get
from
the
bottle
aroma
of
smokey
bbq
meaty
bacon
smoke
delicious
taste
is
just
as
it
smells
nice
balance
between
sweet
meaty
bbq
and
a
slight
bitter
aftertaste
that
leaves
the
palate
clean
and
ready
for
food
or
the
next
sip
lighter
on
the
tongue
than
youd
expect
and
smooth
as
can
be
overall
this
is
a
beer
experience
one
that
helped
to
change
my
own
attitude
as
to
what
beer
could
be
it
is
one
of
my
all
time
favourites
oif
you
enjoy
smoked
foods
this
pairs
very
well
just
smelt
the
empty
glass
15
minutes
after
drinking
smells
like
a
bbq
pit
o
delicious
much
more
complex
than
its
weizen
brother
with
a
less
assertive
barbecue
character
and
more
of
a
noticeable
malt
presence
really
a
perfect
beer
for
this
time
of
year
thanks
a
lot
to
brandonpixieskid
for
bringing
this
back
for
me
from
bamberg
nice
rauch
beer
but
im
not
as
much
of
a
fan
as
i
used
to
be
seems
more
like
a
novelty
than
anything
else
i
quite
enjoy
smoked
beers
but
prefer
the
smoke
to
be
more
of
a
component
of
the
overall
taste
than
the
heavily
dominant
flavor
these
days
once
in
a
while
though
this
is
just
what
the
doctor
ordered
pair
it
with
the
right
foods
and
its
perfect
500
ml
bottle
served
in
a
mug
the
beer
pours
a
reddishbrown
color
with
about
a
half
inch
light
tan
head
head
retention
is
decent
with
a
small
amount
of
lacing
aroma
is
strong
it
smells
mostly
like
smoked
meats
and
malt
along
with
some
bready
malt
and
wood
the
taste
is
similar
to
the
aroma
its
mainly
smoked
meatsmalt
but
theres
also
some
wood
caramel
malt
and
a
bit
of
sweet
dark
fruit
noticeable
too
mouthfeelbody
is
medium
its
a
bit
creamy
with
moderate
soft
carbonation
i
think
its
a
pretty
good
overall
brew
id
buy
this
again
in
the
future
o
a
nice
warming
beer
perfect
for
winter
decent
complexity
and
suprising
drinkability
given
its
strong
smokiness
o
a
very
nice
camp
fire
aroma
is
carried
through
into
the
beer
the
wood
flavor
is
present
but
not
overpowering
it
is
pleasant
this
is
a
very
enjoyable
beer
for
cold
weather
overall
this
is
it
for
rauchbiers
i
dont
need
others
this
one
will
do
just
fine
pours
a
dark
mahogany
with
thin
offwhite
head
that
fades
quickly
aromas
is
of
smoke
fairly
meaty
campfireforward
with
a
heavy
caramel
malt
profile
smoky
but
not
as
much
as
i
hopedexpected
guessing
its
an
older
bottle
taste
is
right
in
line
with
the
nose
smokey
but
not
overly
so
with
a
strong
caramel
malt
backbone
mediumbodied
with
a
smooth
mouthfeel
and
good
carbonation
overall
a
nice
rauchbier
but
i
think
i
need
to
track
down
a
fresh
bottle
i
was
expecting
a
smokebomb
o
an
interesting
beer
jury
is
still
out
on
how
much
i
enjoy
it
right
now
id
put
the
alaskan
smoked
porter
above
it
as
far
as
smoked
beers
go
i
will
try
again
though
definitely
with
some
bbq
or
cheese
prost
i
wouldnt
expect
a
beer
with
this
much
smoke
flavor
to
be
so
damn
drinkable
this
glass
is
vanishing
way
too
fast
i
will
say
that
id
enjoy
an
imperial
version
with
some
chocolate
malt
to
mix
with
the
smoke
i
really
loved
this
beer
but
this
is
also
my
first
of
its
style
and
while
ive
had
a
wide
variety
of
beers
this
one
is
quite
unique
overall
i
think
i
like
this
beer
better
than
the
marzen
it
is
a
lot
more
in
your
face
with
the
smoke
and
i
will
definitely
seek
it
out
again
d
was
a
little
more
impressed
by
the
taste
than
the
marzen
but
like
it
this
beer
is
still
heavy
leaving
you
weighted
down
and
feeling
like
a
meal
in
itself
note
given
the
early
responses
to
this
thread
httpbeeradvocate
comforumread4151434
i
might
give
this
one
another
shot
i
have
had
this
in
the
bottle
and
out
of
the
tap
at
the
brewery
of
course
the
tap
is
better
it
has
a
dark
brownred
body
with
an
odd
colored
head
i
want
call
offwhite
but
that
would
not
be
exactly
right
there
is
lots
of
foam
the
aroma
is
very
much
like
an
old
smokehouse
with
a
little
bit
of
sweetness
to
finish
it
off
this
is
one
of
their
smoother
not
going
to
make
you
gag
if
you
are
new
to
smoked
beer
styles
just
like
all
of
their
beers
it
will
have
that
ham
bacon
taste
the
mouthfeel
is
on
the
heavier
end
of
medium
i
only
recommend
smoked
beer
especially
if
you
are
new
to
them
with
meals
or
for
late
night
sessions
overall
love
it
bacon
in
a
glass
love
the
schlenkerlas
well
i
feel
like
a
schlenkerla
fanboy
but
damn
i
love
these
smoked
beers
they
are
head
and
shoulders
above
everything
other
smoked
beer
out
there
so
good
picked
this
up
at
total
wine
for
about
4
overall
excellent
beer
overall
i
am
new
to
the
world
of
rauchbiers
but
ive
liked
what
ive
had
so
far
i
dont
see
how
they
can
get
much
better
than
this
highly
recommended
this
is
the
measuring
stick
for
rauchbiers
supremely
drinkable
stuff
i
only
wish
it
werent
so
expensive
where
i
live
bacon
deliciousss
filling
space
requirements
overall
seems
to
work
and
feel
better
on
tap
slightly
pours
a
really
dark
brown
w
nice
carbonation
and
little
lacing
nice
one
finger
cocoa
head
which
disappears
quickly
nose
is
fairly
amazing
especially
for
the
style
smoke
and
then
more
smoke
followed
by
beechwood
bacon
split
pea
soup
really
nice
and
not
overpowering
nose
taste
is
really
good
a
little
more
balanced
than
the
nose
fairly
similar
to
the
nose
except
the
taste
of
hops
in
the
background
malt
as
well
on
the
aftertaste
feel
is
medium
to
medium
full
with
a
fairly
thin
finish
overall
this
is
a
great
beer
theres
a
reason
its
2
for
the
style
cheers
ogreat
smokey
rauchbier
i
have
heard
that
this
was
the
standard
i
was
not
disappointed
overall
this
is
an
excellent
rauchbier
expertly
balanced
and
a
pleasure
to
drink
overall
this
was
a
treat
i
wouldnt
hesitate
to
purchase
again
i
cant
say
if
this
is
great
for
the
style
but
as
an
intro
to
smoked
beers
it
worked
for
me
d
an
intense
smokey
experience
while
still
retaining
bocklike
malt
sweetness
very
tasty
and
im
sure
an
excellent
pairing
for
a
lot
of
foods
needs
a
little
carbonation
feels
very
watery
and
thin
o
a
very
smokey
yet
a
very
nice
dark
beer
i
havent
tried
it
yet
but
i
think
this
beer
would
be
great
with
a
nice
grilled
steak
or
bbq
a
great
medium
bodied
delicacy
which
i
highly
recommend
as
a
must
try
for
any
beer
advocate
o
forgettable
wouldnt
get
it
again
it
isnt
bad
just
wanted
something
different
from
the
marzen
overall
the
smoke
is
just
right
and
a
solid
malt
balance
to
clean
it
up
clean
flavors
and
somewhat
dry
finish
are
nice
if
drank
in
moderation
paired
with
the
right
cheese
and
breadcrackers
this
could
be
one
of
the
most
enjoyable
experiences
you
could
have
with
beer
i
will
definately
be
splitting
a
bottle
of
it
with
my
father
later
this
year
oddefinitely
a
individual
style
worth
a
try
i
just
could
never
see
myself
craving
a
rauchbier
not
my
style
i
guess
couldnt
finish
a
great
beer
not
something
you
could
drink
pint
after
pint
of
but
still
easy
drinking
look
forward
to
more
of
the
schlenkerla
offerings
pairs
okay
with
veggie
burgers
but
even
in
that
context
it
didnt
really
sing
o
i
was
surprised
this
didnt
really
remind
me
of
smoked
meat
obviously
there
is
no
fishiness
to
the
beer
but
i
just
cant
get
my
uncles
fresh
smoked
salmon
with
its
salty
and
smoky
flavors
out
of
my
head
overall
this
was
enjoyable
and
i
look
forward
to
seeking
out
more
beers
of
the
style
o
not
a
sessionable
beer
but
perfect
to
savour
over
45
minutes
on
a
cold
night
this
is
only
the
second
rauchbier
i
have
tasted
and
its
uniqueness
and
quality
hit
me
like
a
mallet
ill
have
my
eyes
peeled
for
them
from
now
on
but
this
is
a
tough
act
to
follow
overall
the
smoke
wasnt
as
intense
as
i
expected
and
the
bitterness
was
stronger
i
would
have
liked
a
little
more
smoke
and
to
dial
the
bitterness
down
just
a
bit
another
solid
offering
from
this
brewery
this
was
the
first
smoked
beer
that
i
ever
got
ahold
of
the
style
was
new
to
me
so
i
wasnt
sure
of
what
to
expect
the
beer
poured
out
as
a
dark
brown
with
a
generous
amount
of
head
on
it
the
head
settled
leaving
a
touch
of
lacing
on
the
glass
the
smell
reminded
me
of
bacon
its
had
the
smokiness
of
fresh
cooked
bacon
and
that
was
about
all
on
the
nose
the
taste
of
the
beer
was
also
smokey
and
even
what
i
found
to
be
a
little
salty
the
mouthfeel
was
smooth
but
the
flavors
kept
the
drinkability
to
a
minimum
for
me
overall
i
have
to
say
that
for
a
smoked
beer
it
really
has
those
elements
all
over
it
its
not
really
my
favorite
style
all
that
much
it
is
good
for
those
who
like
them
as
to
be
expected
this
beer
is
amazing
to
pair
with
the
right
foods
o
i
had
this
when
i
first
started
drinking
beer
and
ive
been
a
fan
since
truly
an
epic
rauchbier
i
plan
to
have
some
of
this
in
bamberg
soon
if
you
havent
had
rauchbier
before
split
a
bottle
with
a
friend
or
two
and
some
meats
and
cheeses
its
worth
the
experience
bottle
purchased
from
chans
in
destin
and
poured
into
a
willibecher
pint
glass
beautiful
dark
red
with
a
big
head
that
laces
wonderfully
i
immediately
love
the
smell
not
so
much
bacon
but
to
me
smoked
brisket
smooth
malty
nice
bitterness
surprisingly
drinkable
i
was
intimidated
by
this
style
but
i
am
so
happy
to
have
finally
gotten
hold
of
one
mouthfeel
is
remarkably
lighter
than
i
expected
slightly
oily
not
extremely
carbonated
fairly
clean
and
smoky
finish
and
an
absolutely
delectable
aftertaste
i
will
buy
several
next
time
i
go
to
destin
pours
a
dark
brown
off
white
head
aroma
is
of
deep
smokey
malts
bacon
cured
pork
oaky
smoke
the
flavor
is
of
smoked
malt
bacon
alittle
caramel
and
soft
tea
like
hop
flavor
mostly
just
the
astringent
smoke
mouthfeel
is
medium
bodied
with
a
long
lasting
smokey
finish
overall
similar
to
the
aecht
schlenkerla
marzen
ashy
charcoal
bacony
rauch
goodness
the
mouthfeel
is
medium
bodied
and
smooth
delicious
savory
sipper
this
was
a
sipper
an
i
could
never
do
2
in
a
row
but
this
was
just
great
took
me
a
long
time
to
get
into
and
appreciate
the
style
shows
you
that
you
have
to
keep
trying
as
i
would
have
missed
out
on
something
spectacular
drinkability
awesome
and
great
for
pairing
with
foods
overall
tough
beer
to
judge
and
for
me
definitely
more
of
a
food
beer
the
smoke
components
can
wear
you
out
quickly
but
they
are
a
welcome
novelty
absolutely
would
recommend
with
grilled
meats
couldnt
think
of
a
better
pairing
than
aecht
schlenkerla
rauchbier
urbock
and
ribs
o
this
is
great
its
a
new
taste
experience
for
me
would
probably
be
wonderful
with
bbq
pork
unique
style
and
enjoyable
though
not
an
everyday
beer
for
me
o
if
you
love
smoked
foods
and
bbq
what
is
not
to
love
about
this
beer
ive
been
working
on
trying
new
beers
and
this
one
did
not
disappoint
in
the
least
bit
i
could
kill
some
of
these
on
a
winter
night
fittingly
by
a
bonfire
aasher
just
informed
me
of
its
smoked
hamlike
taste
which
i
cant
believe
i
didnt
catch
onto
this
beer
was
shared
with
zep9865
during
a
mini
tasting
it
poured
a
dark
dark
brown
with
a
one
finger
off
white
head
that
laced
the
glass
it
smells
of
smoked
ham
wood
chips
and
oak
its
full
on
ham
and
is
close
to
krebs
smoked
porter
and
the
alaskan
smoked
porter
in
terms
of
the
nose
the
flavor
is
a
little
subdued
compared
to
the
aromas
it
has
good
flavor
and
is
very
heavy
on
the
ham
but
subdued
compared
to
other
smoked
beers
that
ive
had
i
do
enjoy
this
one
however
its
the
lightest
smoked
beer
that
i
can
say
that
i
really
like
this
is
like
hog
light
in
a
bottle
it
drinks
between
light
and
medium
in
body
and
leaves
behind
a
very
ham
like
aftertaste
and
is
very
moist
its
a
likable
beer
and
worth
a
try
for
sure
i
will
buy
it
again
o
unreal
omy
first
rauchbier
and
it
was
delicious
cheers
i
think
the
smoke
is
a
bit
much
in
this
guy
more
of
a
novelty
experience
than
enjoyment
but
again
it
paired
well
with
food
d
im
a
sucker
for
this
style
so
im
loving
this
if
you
like
smoke
smoked
meats
smoked
cheese
smoked
anything
you
will
like
this
beer
great
representation
of
the
style
from
one
of
the
best
rauchbier
makers
pours
like
a
solid
dark
lager
with
a
off
white
head
and
a
nice
clear
copper
body
and
as
i
was
expecting
the
smokey
bomb
of
a
noted
bacon
smell
i
got
a
nice
interesting
foreground
of
munich
that
was
quite
beery
but
not
something
heavy
handed
not
bacon
but
apples
and
peat
malt
and
beechwood
palate
was
quite
lean
but
with
a
nice
carbonation
that
feel
like
a
lager
had
a
latitude
but
it
was
rather
quick
from
beginning
to
end
palate
of
smoked
malt
dextrose
munich
apple
malty
and
a
ardbeg
scotch
without
the
citrus
notes
the
meatiness
is
there
but
its
let
off
into
something
quite
grainy
this
is
still
a
beer
and
a
great
great
great
food
beer
o
i
was
pleasantly
surprised
with
this
one
having
been
disappointed
by
the
first
couple
german
beers
we
tried
bump
up
in
score
for
the
ridiculousness
of
the
smell
wish
i
could
give
it
a
10
for
smell
very
good
and
one
id
highly
recommend
if
you
want
to
try
a
smoke
beer
but
have
been
scared
off
by
the
smell
pours
dark
mahogany
wood
brown
with
a
nice
uniform
lighttan
head
instant
smoky
overdose
in
the
nostrils
like
walking
into
a
smokehouse
very
malty
with
taste
is
pure
essence
of
wood
grilled
beef
jerky
hard
to
get
over
the
thick
smoke
but
when
paired
with
some
sharp
cheddar
i
changed
my
tone
a
bit
when
i
say
paired
with
sharp
cheddar
i
actually
meant
chased
the
fucker
with
four
cheese
cheezits
but
the
flavor
combination
speaks
for
itself
just
works
o
one
of
the
best
representations
of
a
smoked
beer
that
you
can
get
the
germans
always
do
it
right
when
it
comes
to
smoked
beers
d
i
could
drink
2
of
these
but
not
really
sessionable
i
would
imagine
that
it
tastes
great
with
a
barbecue
pairing
d
this
seems
like
something
that
must
be
paired
with
food
i
like
it
but
it
seems
like
it
should
serve
a
complimentary
role
to
a
meat
dish
so
thats
what
im
going
to
do
pretty
drinkable
every
sip
of
this
takes
you
deeper
beneath
bamberg
where
this
taste
and
smell
has
been
oozing
out
of
for
centuries
this
is
the
quintessential
rauchbier
nice
flavors
but
couldnt
have
many
of
these
the
smoked
flavor
is
only
nice
in
small
doses
and
can
get
overwhelming
after
a
while
ive
been
becoming
more
and
more
a
fan
of
smoke
beers
and
this
has
tipped
the
scale
maybe
its
just
a
phase
but
im
in
love
an
awesome
unique
german
lager
definitely
an
acquired
taste
but
underrated
in
my
book
i
liked
this
much
better
than
their
marzen
rauchbier
man
do
i
loves
me
the
smoke
even
better
that
i
get
to
revisit
this
old
smoky
favorite
it
pours
a
sunset
russetbrown
topped
by
a
finger
of
dirty
white
foam
the
nose
comprises
smoked
bacon
toffee
and
clean
cedar
the
taste
puts
a
bit
more
char
into
the
smoke
and
a
touch
more
cedar
into
everything
the
toffee
is
toned
down
a
decent
amount
allowing
the
slightly
mapley
smoke
to
run
as
wild
as
it
wants
the
body
is
on
the
lighter
side
of
medium
with
a
light
moderate
carbonation
and
a
lightly
drying
finish
overall
a
very
nice
bit
o
rauch
a
classic
indeed
a
nice
pleasant
surprise
but
if
for
some
reason
you
dont
care
for
smoked
bacon
this
is
not
a
beer
for
you
for
sure
drinkability
a
nice
beer
in
the
german
rauchbier
style
drinkability
is
great
great
balance
excellent
smokey
character
that
balances
really
well
with
the
base
beer
definitely
my
favourite
of
the
schlenkerla
lineup
that
ive
had
tasty
rauch
mouthfeel
is
great
medium
to
full
bodied
with
low
carbonation
silky

i
may
even
try
it
again
way
down

perhaps
after
trying
less
intense

especially
if
i
had
the
right
cheese
and
someone
to
split
it
with
maybe
i
should
just
go
back
to

it

just

i

i
had
to
dump
the

ill
have
a
bitter

but
this
is
extreme
recommended
pspil
am
from
the
same
brewery
as
weizenbock
and
i
enjoyed
it
d
very
nice
the
combination
of
the
rich
sweet
bock
malt
character
with
the
smoky
malt
creates
something
that
is
almost
like
a
stout
or
smoked
porter
this
beer
seems
more
toasted
and
smoky
than
what
i
have
had
from
schlenkerla
in
the
past
and
it
has
a
high
level
of
sweetness
that
helps
to
balance
out
the
intense
smoke
this
is
well
worth
trying
though
i
would
stick
with
the
marzen
if
given
a
choice
of
the
brewerys
beers
dark
tawny

mostly
clear
and
brilliant
but
a
good

of
yeast

around
thinnish

a
longlasting
haze
on
the
surface
good
amount
of
active
carbonation
intense
smoke
aroma
meaty
and
earthy
rich
robust
malts
create
a
slightly
sweet
odor
the
flavor
is
not
quite
as
smoky
instead
of
overpowering
the
smoke
complements
a
sweet
and
complex
malt
profile
slight
floral
hop
flavor
with
a
nice
balancing
bitterness
light
to
medium
in
body
with
a
substantial
yet
airy
mouthfeel
the
intensity
of
the
smoke
aroma
was
a
bit
offputting
at
first
but
the
flavor
of
this
one
is
a
great
mix
of
smokiness
and
malt
sweetness
with
just
enough
hop
bitterness
to
balance
it
all
out
drinkability
quite
nice
d
a
very
good
example
of
a
rauchbier
its
insanely
smokey
and
bacony
i
enjoyed
it
and
would
have
it
again
paired
with
some
extra

a

some

it

tastes

i
dont
find
rauchbiers
to
be
all
that
drinkable
but
this
one
is
somewhat
easy
to
quaff
considering
very
good
rauchbier
d
this
beer
is
fascinating
and
i
bet
goes
very
well
with
bbq
the
initial
smokiness
is
intense
but
mellows
within
a
few
minutes
i
dont
know

so

hate

d
a

while
your

warms
up

but
well
worth
the
journey
the
body
is
medium
and
feels
somewhat
watery
overall
this
is
a
top
notch
rauchbier
definitely
the
best
i
have
tried
to
date
although
i
have
often
stayed
away
from
this
style
in
the
past
d
great
beer
loved
every
minute
of
it
of
course
i
love
me
a
smokey
bacon
bbq
beer
and
this
is
one
that
tops
the
cake
for
me
a
full
flavoured
bock
without
those
raw
alcoholic
flavours
with
a
very
mellow
and
elegant
smoke
way
better
than
the
bottled
version
asking
the
publican
regarding
this
he
thought
it
might
be
because
of
the
cask
and
the
freshness
this
beer
was
filled
just
a
few
days
ago
d
an
acquired
taste
great
with
grilled
meat
drink
it
warm
and
slow
mediumbodied
lightly
carbonated
drinkability
is
good
for
as
bold
a
taste
smell
as
this
presents
its
very
easydrinking
i
think
the
mouthfeel
has
a
lot
to
do
with
it
the
bold
flavor
subsides
a
bit
mellowing
out
great
beer
drinkability
wow
when
a
beer
is
this
intense
for
the
drinkability
to
be
this
high
is
a
true
achievement
taking
nearperfect
balance
just
a
phenomenal
beer
and
like
pretty
much
everything
they
put
out
an
absolute
benchmark
of
the
style
overall
this
beer
is
well
balanced
and
delicious
surprisingly
easy
to
drink
too
i
thoroughly
enjoyed
drinking
this
overall
this
was
actually
my
first
time
trying
a
rauchbier
and
i
honestly
have
to
say
this
is
a
new
style
ive
fallen
in
love
with
however
its
very
unique
and
will
probably
come
as
an
acquired
taste
for
many
nonetheless
something
tells
me
ill
be
coming
back
to
this
one
regularly
during
the
winter
and
enjoying
some
sausage
or
bratwursts
with
it
drinkability
good
stuff
not
sure
ill
be
loading
up
on
it
but
glad
i
tried
it
drinkability
rauchbiers
are
certainly
unique
brews
ive
never
known
a
beer
that
tasted
and
smelt
like
meat
this
is
the
first
rauchbier
ive
had
but
ill
certainly
be
looking
to
try
more
of
them
in
the
future
i
can
understand
why
this
beer
is
so
revered
but
its
not
something
i
can
drink
a
lot
of
in
small
quantities
its
very
enjoyable
drinkability
is
a
little
lower
with
the
sticky
finish
minerality
salty
flavor
and
heavy
smoke
which
are
all
tolerable
but
knock
it
down
a
bit
drinkability
heavy
but
tasty
enough
for
one
to
drink
this
in
quantity
but
it
will
lose
some
of
its
richness
best
to
enjoy
only
a
few
at
a
time
one
of
the
worlds
greatest
breweries
d
drinks
well
enough
but
it
doesnt
leap
out
and
scream
for
more
final
notes
quite
a
good
beer
overall
looks
and
smells
wonderful
and
is
very
potent
tastes
pretty
good
and
feels
very
good
but
one
of
these
will
be
more
than
enough
d
very
drinkable
though
i
find
one
glass
to
be
sufficient
this
brewery
sets
the
standard
for
german
rauchbiers
highly
recommended
pleansantly
surprised
with
this
i
really
liked
it
this
one
is
a
winner
nose
is
incredibly
smoky
mesquite
wood
dark
almost
opaque
body
taste
is
overpoweringly
smoky
but
good
with
very
faint
apple
and
heavy
malt
complemented
by
smoked
gouda
for
obvious
reasons
mouthfeel
is
almost
insubstantial
not
the
focus
of
this
beer
highly
drinkable
especially
with
cheeses
d
i
opened
this
on
a
day
i
grilled
a
beef
tritip
roast
for
optimal
tasting
conditions
but
i
still
couldnt
handle
this
beer
i
only
made
it
3
or
4
sips
in
before
moving
on
to
something
else
the
smoke
flavor
was
so
strong
that
it
overpowered
anything
else
the
similarity
to
liquid
smoke
didnt
help
at
all
either
it
was
much
smoother
than
i
thought
it
would
be
so
if
i
was
really
in
the
mood
for
a
nice
cold
glass
of
smoke
this
would
probably
be
what
i
would
drink
obviously
this
isnt
a
style
i
have
learned
to
appreciate
yet
but
i
do
see
how
someone
might
enjoy
this
drinkability
this
is
my
first
rauchbier
and
i
really
like
the
style
i
love
smoked
gouda
cheese
and
this
basically
tastes
like
smoked
gouda
cheesebeer
fantastic
dgreat
beer
this
is
a
classic
smoked
beer
not
overly
smoky
at
all
i
would
have
this
beer
again
d
quite
drinkable
not
sure
i
could
drink
it
everyday
but
i
could
certainly
try
d
pretty
intense
smoke
flavor
with
this
one
so
its
definitely
no
session
beer
but
is
a
nice
sipper
would
probably
be
great
with
some
nice
dark
bread
and
an
aged
swiss
style
cheese
drinkability
this
is
truly
a
unique
beer
however
this
beer
has
a
definitely
overpowering
smokiness
that
needs
to
be
paired
with
a
meal
to
truly
enjoy
it
not
a
daily
drinker
but
definetly
one
for
special
occasions
pours
a
clear
dark
brown
color
13
inch
head
of
a
pale
tan
color
great
retention
and
great
lacing
smells
of
smoke
sweet
malt
and
a
hint
of
roasted
malt
fits
the
style
of
a
rauchbier
mouth
feel
is
slightly
smooth
and
clean
with
an
average
carbonation
tastes
of
strong
smoke
sweet
malt
slight
roasted
malt
hint
of
yeast
and
hint
of
grain
overall
a
very
good
rauchbier
drinkability
this
is
a
fine
beer
but
ive
found
with
this
one
as
i
do
with
most
of
the
smoked
beers
ive
tried
the
smoke
conceals
some
of
the
things
i
enjoy
in
a
bock
this
was
worth
a
try
and
i
did
enjoy
it
but
that
said
ill
probably
not
repeat
it
very
often
and
given
a
choice
id
go
for
the
helles
lager
from
the
same
brewery
since
in
that
beer
the
smoke
is
more
subtle
and
for
me
is
better
integrated
with
the
rest
of
the
flavors
at
the
cloverleaf
tavern
caldwell
nj
poured
a
deep
mahogany
brown
nearblack
with
less
than
onefinger
of
beige
head
smelled
like
liquid
kielbasa
roast
malt
toast
biscuit
smoke
and
even
some
bitter
chocolate
and
coffee
came
through
in
the
nose
the
taste
was
immensely
smokey
at
first
with
a
malty
dissolve
and
a
slight
coffee
finish
with
a
smoke
aftertaste
thicker
yet
more
carbonated
than
expected
which
eased
the
intake
commensurately
truly
an
excellent
specimen
of
the
style
if
not
the
bellwether
d
this
beer
is
so
potent
in
flavor
that
it
becomes
taxing
rapidly
i
have
nothing
to
add
chaps
other
than
get
some
i
will
have
no
problem
finishing
this
bottle
and
i
will
continue
to
seek
out
more
like
this
being
the
first
rauchbier
i
have
had
i
have
a
feeling
this
one
sets
the
bar
pretty
high
this
one
has
a
nice
cherrystained
wood
appearance
clear
with
some
tan
rocky
head
that
leaves
a
little
lacing
pretty
color
better
head
than
the
marzen
smell
is
ok
some
smokiness
and
some
nuttiness
though
it
is
quite
muted
taste
is
pretty
good
some
nice
charred
smoke
flavors
with
some
nuttiness
and
a
bit
of
maltiness
in
there
my
only
complaint
is
that
the
smoke
flavors
arent
quite
as
rich
and
flavorful
as
some
other
rauchbiers
ive
hadthis
one
flirts
with
the
ashy
side
of
smoke
which
i
do
not
like
it
doesnt
go
quite
as
far
on
the
ashiness
as
weyerbachers
fireside
ale
but
its
not
perfect
im
looking
for
flavors
of
roasted
pork
bbq
etc
medium
mouthfeel
clean
and
light
on
the
palate
without
moving
too
fast
to
get
any
flavor
decent
drinkability
though
the
ashiness
came
out
as
the
bottle
came
along
making
it
a
bit
tougher
toward
the
end
monument
to
balance
and
drinkability
for
the
style
i
need
to
line
up
some
of
the
other
releases
from
this
brewer
to
tease
out
the
differences
overall
an
interesting
beer
and
one
that
would
have
totally
taken
me
by
surprise
if
it
werent
for
fort
collins
brewery
and
their
z
lager
after
taking
a
shot
at
aecht
marzen
a
while
ago
and
after
finding
myself
in
a
rather
smoky
mood
at
the
liquor
store
i
thought
id
give
this
one
a
try
glad
i
did
too
it
retains
the
phenomenal
meaty
charred
scent
characteristic
of
aechts
brews
but
with
a
slightly
richer
flavor
thats
more
in
line
with
what
one
would
expect
of
such
a
wellpresented
beverage
mouthfeel
again
is
slightly
more
watery
than
id
hope
but
still
drinkable
and
the
taste
lingers
pleasantly
in
the
mouth
for
a
while
would
probably
buy
again
beer
is
medium
to
light
in
body
and
the
smoke
is
the
dominant
flavor
in
here
it
finishes
pretty
cleanly
and
the
smokiness
kind
of
lingers
in
your
mouth
but
not
as
an
aftertaste
there
is
some
mild
caramel
in
there
if
you
can
see
past
the
smoke
overall
its
pretty
good
not
my
favorite
of
the
bunch
but
a
damn
fine
one
singles
were
30
discounted
so
i
picked
this
one
up
because
ive
always
wanted
to
try
it
but
the
price
tag
had
always
scared
me
off
very
pleasantly
surprised
nice
smoky
flavor
without
being
too
overthetop
definitely
reminded
me
of
smoked
ham
mmmm
ham
beer
d
what
an
experience
this
beer
is
a
all
the
way
d
as
with
the
marzen
this
is
a
crazy
experience
delicious
stuff
the
ultimate
bbq
beer
every
bbq
restaurant
should
have
this
stuff
in
bottles
went
well
with
a
charcoal
grilled
memorial
day
burger
the
beer
pours
dark
red
with
a
tan
head
this
is
an
awesome
looking
beer
the
aroma
is
lots
of
meaty
smoke
with
a
little
roasted
malt
the
flavor
is
heavy
on
the
smoke
with
some
darker
malts
and
some
dark
fruits
mixed
in
as
well
as
the
beer
warms
the
smoke
becomes
more
intense
medium
mouthfeel
and
lowmedium
carbonation
d
the
beer
has
enough
flavor
to
probably
stand
up
on
its
own
but
its
likely
best
paired
with
foods
such
as
barbecue
having
recently
had
a
rauchbier
on
tap
at
the
other
side
this
one
caught
my
eye
today
in
the
beer
store
16
9oz
brown
bottle
pours
a
chestnut
brown
with
visible
carbonation
and
small
whitish
head
that
quickly
dissipates
the
smell
is
great
smoky
as
expected
immediately
calling
to
mind
backyard
bbqs
and
fireplaces
taste
follows
especially
up
front
but
back
end
has
some
smoother
maltiness
agree
with
other
reviews
that
mouthefeel
is
somewhat
thin
and
would
not
be
able
to
go
for
more
than
1
of
these
but
an
excellent
beer
nonetheless
at
first
i
felt
that
i
would
not
be
able
to
finish
this
beer
but
the
tongue
gets
used
to
the
smoky
flavor
and
it
becomes
more
and
more
welcome
with
each
mouthful
although
i
completed
it
im
not
sure
id
order
another
perhaps
this
is
just
not
my
style
i
poured
into
a
pint
glass
to
three
fingers
of
tan
head
it
is
brown
the
aroma
is
smoky
like
barbeque
the
taste
is
smoky
as
well
with
some
burnt
caramel
malt
the
mouthfeel
is
medium
it
is
another
good
rauchbier
this
one
is
more
subtle
than
the
marzen
i
preferred
the
stronger
smokiness
of
that
one
i
did
confirm
my
suspicion
this
beer
is
great
with
grilled
meat
d
a
great
beer
for
a
few
ounce
glass
but
a
little
more
than
that
especially
without
an
accompanying
food
pairing
and
this
will
get
overwhelming
3
5
d
this
is
my
first
true
rauchbier
and
its
quite
a
ride
the
smoke
flavor
is
massive
and
i
probably
wasnt
prepared
ill
try
to
find
a
bunch
more
of
these
then
come
back
to
this
one
and
see
if
i
feel
any
different
about
it
medcarbonation
light
bodied
and
oh
so
drinkable
very
well
balanced
and
the
smoke
isnt
overpowering
in
the
slightest
overall
very
enjoyable
and
pleasantly
surprising
md
seems
very
light
and
would
need
to
be
consumed
with
the
right
foods
i
just
couldnt
get
into
this
beer
it
was
somewhat
overwhelming
in
taste
and
smell
i
attribute
that
to
my
lack
of
exposure
to
this
style
i
would
like
to
try
again
now
that
i
know
what
to
expect
d
hard
to
say
i
could
enjoy
the
smoke
sip
after
sip
but
the
aftertaste
is
wearing
on
me
i
havent
seen
any
mention
of
this
issue
in
the
other
reviews
ive
read
so
ill
chalk
it
up
to
this
bottle
i
would
love
to
try
it
again
especially
from
a
different
source
while
it
makes
me
thirsty
it
does
beckon
sip
after
sip
not
that
i
have
shelves
full
of
options
in
this
style
but
this
just
became
my
goto
rauchbier
to
me
this
is
a
great
beer
experience
i
let
my
wife
motherinlaw
and
fatherinlaw
take
a
sip
and
lets
just
say
the
ladies
werent
into
it
you
will
definitely
be
wowed
by
this
and
it
is
an
acquired
taste
to
be
sure
im
actually
really
digging
this
brew
i
just
popped
my
smokebeer
cherry
with
this
but
i
am
already
anxious
to
try
more
rauchbier
to
see
how
this
measures
up
another
winner
from
this
brewery
i
dare
say
all
their
beers
seem
to
pretty
much
taste
the
same
to
a
degree
but
when
they
taste
this
good
who
cares
that
familiar
bacon
roast
bushfire
smokiness
perhaps
not
as
pronounced
as
some
of
their
other
beers
no
hop
action
to
speak
of
but
that
doesnt
matter
a
medium
weighted
body
hardly
any
bitterness
but
lovely
dry
smokiness
all
the
way
down
lovely
stuff
in
my
adventures
and
travels
5
years
ago
i
came
across
a
small
town
in
germany
named
bamberg
i
was
there
with
the
173rd
airborne
this
town
is
know
for
its
exceptional
smoked
beers
now
at
first
you
might
think
smoking
a
beer
sounds
crazy
but
let
me
tell
you
have
a
big
old
plate
of
jager
schnitzel
with
a
few
of
these
so
heavenly
im
not
going
to
go
into
detail
about
this
beer
but
i
must
tell
you
its
is
a
must
for
any
beer
connoisseur
for
the
sheer
experience
very
interesting
in
a
very
good
way
curious
to
see
what
other
rauchbiers
are
like
d
what
an
outstanding
beer
i
hope
i
make
it
to
bamberg
someday
to
test
the
drinkability
of
several
rauchbiers
its
amazing
that
despite
the
oddity
and
intensity
of
the
style
this
is
a
beer
that
i
want
served
by
the
liter
feel
and
drinkability
body
is
heavy
with
low
carbonation
as
befits
the
bock
part
of
this
cant
ask
more
from
the
feel
aspect
of
this
it
cant
be
beat
this
is
one
hell
of
a
drinkable
beer
its
easy
to
drink
i
love
it
the
only
problem
is
though
id
like
to
drink
more
than
one
of
these
after
a
while
the
taste
buds
become
used
to
the
smokiness
and
smoked
meat
that
it
offers
and
it
becomes
less
potent
and
mind
blowing
as
i
near
the
end
of
the
bottle
the
palate
becomes
accumulated
to
it
however
this
is
prolly
the
fourth
or
fifth
bottle
ive
had
in
the
span
of
two
months
for
a
single
beer
that
costs
about
six
dollars
thats
pretty
regular
definitely
give
this
a
try
hugely
worth
it
ill
always
be
coming
back
to
this
beer
its
a
shame
that
this
was
my
first
smoked
beer
it
being
one
of
the
best
ill
be
disappointed
with
all
others
i
try
d
this
is
a
nice
beer
huge
nose
and
smokey
flavor
it
would
be
great
with
nice
meal
or
like
i
drank
mine
sitting
by
the
fire
i
dont
think
of
it
as
a
session
beermy
eyes
might
start
watering
notes
certainly
a
brew
not
ready
for
all
palates
occasions
or
even
smoked
sessions
but
quite
the
awesome
beer
in
any
case
knowing
what
is
coming
and
in
the
right
moment
this
can
be
wonderful
its
not
rough
around
the
edged
not
at
all
but
there
is
nothing
shy
about
the
german
smoked
profile
here
d
fairly
easy
to
drink
there
are
a
ton
of
flavors
going
on
here
and
letting
this
warm
up
a
lot
helps
all
the
flavors
to
meld
together
and
mix
nicely
nice
beer
that
is
great
in
the
winter
and
would
pair
nicely
with
just
about
any
strongly
flavored
meat
recommended
d
i
dont
find
any
rauchbiers
to
be
very
drinkable
but
this
one
goes
down
a
bit
easier
than
others
i
have
tried
still
one
bottle
is
enough
for
me
in
a
sitting
d
starts
of
pretty
tasty
but
at
about
half
way
through
it
gets
a
bit
cloying
mouthfeel
if
you
dont
enjoy
the
taste
its
hard
to
enjoy
whatever
complexities
may
be
evidence
from
throwing
a
roasted
pig
or
something
into
the
boil
drinkability
this
is
damn
challenging
the
pour
produces
garnetlike
dark
brown
fluid
with
reddish
hue
topped
by
contrasting
light
tan
creamy
head
that
dissipates
forming
thin
yet
firm
film
smoke
soot
from
burnt
wood
is
by
far
the
most
prominent
aroma
followed
by
melanoidins
subdued
prunes
and
well
masked
soft
alcohol
the
smoky
bitter
and
prune
like
sweet
fruity
flavors
of
the
smooth
creamy
and
slightly
greasy
fluid
correspond
to
the
aromas
excellent
without
any
harsh
burnt
or
charred
flavors
this
brew
brings
a
sensation
of
small
cooking
chambers
blackened
from
smoke
soot
that
were
in
use
in
ancient
times
and
can
still
be
seen
in
preserved
rustic
farm
houses
an
interesting
beer
to
say
the
least
500ml
bottle
poured
in
dimpled
mug
big
beer
hardcore
smoke
lots
of
malt
smoke
and
alcohol
with
sausage
like
smokey
flavour
comes
with
all
the
expected
aroma
too
great
experience
creamy
tan
head
pours
about
2
fingers
and
quickly
settles
with
some
lacework
sweetish
full
body
with
lots
of
roasted
malt
and
caramel
bittersweet
finish
d
well
this
was
certainly
a
unique
beer
experience
that
im
glad
i
tried
but
not
one
ill
be
trying
again
anytime
soon
rauchbier
in
general
this
really
wasnt
my
style
but
i
couldnt
really
pan
it
as
it
seemed
to
fit
the
criteria
of
the
style
in
general
it
really
did
deliver
on
the
description
so
if
you
think
youd
like
it
give
it
a
try
this
was
my
first
foray
into
the
style
of
smoked
beers
the
beer
wasnt
that
bad
but
the
smoke
profile
was
definetly
what
you
would
call
an
acquired
taste
perhaps
if
that
smoke
flavor
were
more
subdued
this
would
have
been
a
more
enjoyable
experience
but
it
was
too
overpowering
for
me
to
be
enthusiastic
about
exploring
this
again
anytime
soon
drinkability
is
really
very
impressive
considering
the
super
high
smoke
character
it
tastes
very
traditionalnatural
and
not
at
all
like
liquid
smoke
this
beer
pours
extremely
smooth
with
a
tan
head
that
lasts
forever
i
had
read
about
the
beer
before
so
i
knew
it
was
smoky
but
i
had
no
idea
that
it
would
taste
as
my
vegan
friend
put
it
like
liquid
bacon
i
thought
the
smoked
beers
i
have
tried
before
were
representative
of
the
style
but
this
blew
them
out
of
the
water
the
others
stone
alaskan
anything
else
purporting
to
be
smoked
has
nothing
on
aecht
schlenkerla
rauchbier
it
took
some
getting
used
to
but
i
thoroughly
enjoyed
this
beer
pours
a
ruby
brown
color
with
a
one
finger
off
tan
head
with
good
retention
smell
is
smoky
much
like
smoked
ham
with
some
sweet
malt
the
flavor
is
smoky
and
sweet
and
still
reminds
me
of
smoke
ham
some
caramel
is
present
in
the
flavor
very
much
a
malt
lovers
beer
very
smooth
and
easy
to
drink
low
carbonation
and
medium
bodied
many
have
said
rauchbiers
are
an
acquired
taste
but
i
acquired
a
taste
for
them
right
away
very
drinkable
poured
a
ruby
reddish
brown
with
one
finger
head
that
slowly
died
an
intense
roasted
smokey
malt
smell
that
has
obvious
meat
smells
as
well
a
dry
smokey
meaty
taste
in
a
thick
body
but
maintains
a
smoothness
that
borders
on
creamy
and
is
not
overpowering
in
fact
a
good
balance
between
the
smokiness
and
some
sweet
malts
as
well
as
a
hint
of
dark
fruit
is
noticeable
making
this
a
very
enjoyable
beer
that
is
great
to
sip
on
as
it
finishes
nice
and
clean
im
a
fan
time
to
look
out
for
more
rauchbiers
from
this
brewery
pours
a
pure
black
darkness
bit
of
white
head
but
not
a
ton
even
with
a
vigorous
pour
lacing
is
intense
with
a
pure
sheet
of
foam
sticking
to
the
sides
smells
very
smoky
as
expected
taste
is
less
smoky
than
expected
but
incredibly
refreshing
and
light
for
the
style
hints
of
caramel
and
brown
sugar
mouthfeel
is
very
light
for
such
a
dark
beer
drinkability
is
good
but
hampered
by
the
strong
smoke
presence
very
enjoyable
beer
poured
into
a
shaker
pint
rich
clear
copper
color
and
a
nice
tan
head
that
slowly
turns
to
a
film
good
lacing
this
is
one
beer
i
could
sit
around
all
night
just
to
inhale
the
aroma
which
is
just
like
walking
into
a
smokehouse
filled
with
bacon
its
really
smooth
with
a
barely
able
to
detect
bock
taste
a
wonderful
smokey
aftertaste
makes
me
want
to
run
out
to
my
local
rib
joint
for
a
rack
taste
is
nice
toasty
fruitiness
with
raisiny
spice
some
prune
light
fruityalcoholic
sweetness
accompanied
by
light
but
persistent
smokey
quality
complementing
everything
it
is
mostly
dry
but
with
light
sweetness
before
dryish
finish
and
faintly
sweet
aftertaste
it
has
a
light
herbal
toasty
bitter
hint
as
well
d
a
fascinating
brew
with
an
amazing
flavor
this
is
one
of
the
smokier
rauchbiers
ive
come
across
worth
seeking
out
d
how
do
i
get
this
in
my
bar
and
who
is
the
local
distributor
ive
had
3
beers
from
this
brewery
and
i
know
i
know
that
when
i
get
a
bottle
of
the
marzen
i
will
have
an
immediate
stiffy
like
sushi
if
one
can
get
over
any
taboo
that
may
be
associated
with
this
style
squash
any
fear
or
apprehension
it
will
ultimately
result
in
one
of
the
most
pleasurable
drinking
experiences
life
has
to
offer
not
a
session
beer
for
me
but
one
hell
of
a
beautiful
thing
great
beer
if
of
course
completely
dominated
by
the
smoke
with
some
thought
and
consideration
other
qualities
become
apparent
poured
with
very
little
head
and
a
tiny
bit
of
lace
color
is
an
almost
opaque
dark
aged
cherry
wood
aroma
is
as
stated
above
smokey
and
then
some
malt
and
thats
about
it
flavors
the
same
with
a
little
malt
and
dark
ripe
fruit
sweetness
body
is
decent
and
so
is
carbonation
finish
is
pretty
much
smoke
and
then
theres
the
smokiness
dont
notice
the
alcohol
much
pretty
good
beer
within
the
narrow
class
not
a
session
beer
unless
youre
a
smoke
fanatic
overall
this
is
the
classic
rauchbier
i
would
rank
just
above
their
marzen
and
way
above
the
weizen
most
highly
recommend
especially
if
you
want
to
try
the
rauchbier
style
might
as
well
start
at
the
top
for
me
i
love
the
style
but
the
meaty
aroma
and
flavor
would
be
too
much
after
one
so
this
is
an
every
couple
months
style
when
i
want
to
have
a
rauchbier
this
one
will
jump
to
front
of
mind
for
sure
rotation
not
avail
in
tx
so
got
as
an
extra
if
avail
here
id
have
every
couple
months
asis
keep
trading
for
it
definite
ontap
if
i
can
find
it
pretty
much
the
same
thing
as
the
marzen
i
probably
could
not
tell
the
difference
between
the
two
this
one
might
have
a
little
more
sweet
malt
but
it
is
hard
to
tell
this
is
a
world
renowned
brewery
and
their
beers
are
without
a
doubt
worth
a
try
i
am
just
not
the
biggest
rauchbier
fan
a
must
for
fans
of
the
style
though
this
is
my
first
review
im
half
thru
with
this
beer
and
all
i
can
say
is
wow
i
typically
drink
lighter
beers
like
a
good
crystal
wissbier
i
am
a
avid
bbq
er
and
love
smokey
flavor
this
is
like
drinking
the
smokey
flavor
i
usually
have
to
wait
all
day
to
taste
after
smoking
ribs
to
get
not
a
beer
id
drink
every
day
but
ill
be
drinking
this
one
alot
more
poured
into
a
snifter
no
head
and
barely
any
bubbles
on
top
but
the
color
and
clarity
are
great
sorta
deep
brownishred
kinda
soy
sauce
colored
but
brilliantly
clear
aroma
of
sweet
smoke
faint
milk
chocolate
and
blackstrap
molasses
flavor
comes
in
with
chocolate
a
sorta
light
milk
chocolate
clean
smoke
and
a
great
mineralslate
character
like
smelling
someones
fireplace
while
walking
around
outside
during
a
wet
winter
wow
thats
a
little
much
huh
finishes
with
a
nice
clean
crisp
bitterness
that
leaves
the
palate
clear
and
ready
for
another
sip
perfect
body
and
easy
to
drink
although
as
much
as
i
love
this
beer
i
dont
think
id
be
up
for
3
or
4
of
these
in
an
evening
the
smoke
could
get
oppressive
d
tasty
goes
down
easily
not
too
filling
mild
kick
good
representation
of
style
this
is
one
beer
that
does
the
smoked
flavor
quite
well
and
would
be
one
of
the
first
beers
id
look
for
if
i
were
in
the
mood
of
that
kind
of
beer
one
of
the
best
smoked
beers
available
overall
very
nice
to
drink
especially
with
food
but
more
of
a
onceoff
beer
really
reading
the
description
of
a
rauchbier
this
beer
is
very
true
to
the
style
so
i
had
trouble
rating
this
one
its
definitely
worth
trying
as
this
is
a
unique
bee
style
however
i
dont
think
i
could
drink
more
than
one
of
these
at
a
sitting
d
i
could
drink
this
all
night
another
excellent
rauchbier
from
aecht
schlenkerla
a
beer
that
everyone
should
try
at
least
once
again
awesome
with
food
having
some
with
homemade
pizza
now
and
it
is
the
perfect
accompaniment
overall
this
is
the
biggest
smoked
beer
that
ive
had
and
i
will
certainly
revisit
it
again
at
some
point
in
the
future
not
as
wellbalanced
as
the
marzen
but
if
smoke
is
what
youre
looking
for
then
look
no
further
the
taste
and
smell
are
amazing
there
is
smokiness
with
a
bit
of
pork
like
smoked
sausage
the
flavor
is
not
overwhelming
though
and
would
allow
you
to
drink
a
couple
of
these
without
killing
your
tastebuds
great
effort
mfd
slightly
oily
but
very
drinkable
i
dont
think
i
would
want
to
drink
these
all
day
but
1
or
2
serves
as
a
nice
fall
treat
deep
amber
with
a
thin
tan
head
with
good
retention
great
lacework
too
on
the
nose
this
is
glorious
smoky
bacon
with
a
great
brown
sugarcaramel
character
lending
an
almost
bbq
like
aroma
mild
tobacco
smoke
is
also
present
the
opening
flavors
are
smoky
with
a
woody
smoky
bacon
character
with
a
prominent
earthy
hop
bite
excellent
mild
sweetness
with
caramel
and
brown
sugar
mid
palate
before
a
dry
smoky
finish
medium
in
body
with
high
carbonation
a
touch
higher
than
it
needs
to
be
this
beer
is
a
joy
to
drink
especially
this
fresh
this
is
really
good
stuff
a
tad
disappointing
given
the
reputation
but
still
a
good
smoky
beer
the
beer
is
a
dark
mahoganyred
with
a
slowly
dissipating
head
the
aroma
is
smoky
but
more
restrained
than
expected
its
the
smoke
aroma
of
a
subtle
refined
smoked
meat
its
complex
and
sweet
malt
manages
to
peak
out
from
the
smoke
the
flavor
is
good
and
smoky
without
being
completely
dominated
by
meat
or
smoke
the
malt
is
a
bit
lighter
and
simpler
than
expected
but
theres
more
hops
and
bitterness
its
warm
with
notes
of
fruit
berries
sweet
coffee
and
citrus
the
mouthfeel
is
a
tad
thin
but
not
too
bad
i
do
enjoy
a
smoked
beer
though
and
this
one
is
fairly
delicious
notes
i
am
new
to
smoked
beers
and
on
my
first
impression
i
was
a
little
put
off
by
the
smell
because
of
the
strong
bacon
scent
i
was
pleasantly
surprised
by
the
smooth
yet
complex
taste
of
the
beer
i
wouldnt
defiantly
go
out
of
my
way
to
taste
this
again
very
smooth
drinking
medium
body
especially
since
it
is
so
smokey
huge
smoked
malt
flavor
with
hints
of
oatmeal
chocolate
malt
barbecued
bacon
charcoal
and
subtle
hop
presence
the
smokiness
is
not
overbearing
and
i
actually
wish
there
was
more
of
it
this
beer
is
awesome
pours
a
clear
rich
mahogany
in
color
with
a
bit
over
a
finger
of
tan
head
aroma
is
dominated
by
a
nice
smoky
character
that
is
moderately
strong
and
is
at
times
reminiscent
of
bacon
there
is
a
good
malt
presence
in
the
background
taste
is
much
like
the
aroma
the
character
is
mostly
smoky
with
malty
and
toasty
undertones
the
character
of
this
beer
is
fairly
reminiscent
of
a
marzen
with
some
nice
smoky
aroma
and
flavor
mouthfeel
is
pretty
good
with
medium
body
and
moderatehigh
carbonation
drinkability
is
pretty
good
overall
this
beer
is
easy
to
drink
with
great
complexity
and
plenty
of
flavors
to
keep
things
interesting
cheers
mfd
this
is
a
full
flavour
beer
but
it
has
a
medium
body
though
it
is
undoubtedly
a
small
problem
i
would
have
wanted
the
beer
to
have
more
of
a
body
my
increasing
the
carbonation
a
little
more
the
beer
is
just
above
flat
the
head
is
testimony
to
that
im
not
saying
this
beer
should
be
a
big
frothy
and
bubbly
lager
but
i
think
it
needed
more
carbonation
to
make
the
mouthfeel
a
bit
more
lively
and
to
thicken
out
the
body
in
general
d
this
beer
is
amazingly
drinkable
as
i
could
easily
throw
back
a
few
mugs
and
still
crave
more
this
is
definitely
up
there
on
my
favorites
list
this
beer
pours
a
clear
deep
reddish
brown
with
a
half
inch
light
tan
head
head
recedes
rapidly
but
leaves
nice
sporadic
sheets
of
lacing
on
the
glass
nose
is
pure
campfire
goodness
nice
smokiness
hint
of
bacon
but
not
too
overpowering
as
you
can
pick
up
on
caramel
malts
and
just
a
touch
of
hops
taste
is
quite
nice
smoked
flavoring
is
a
given
at
first
its
about
all
you
taste
bottled
campfire
but
its
not
as
heavy
on
the
smokiness
as
the
marzen
the
emphasis
on
the
malts
mostly
caramel
come
through
much
more
as
the
beer
warms
a
bit
woody
taste
and
a
touch
of
i
think
maple
is
in
here
there
is
definitely
a
sweeter
finish
too
it
that
linger
on
the
tongue
medium
bodied
medium
carbonation
a
bit
of
an
oily
feel
to
it
this
is
a
great
beer
it
actually
worked
quite
well
with
some
smoked
cheddar
and
bread
perfect
dinner
blend
for
me
last
evening
its
a
smoked
beer
for
sure
and
a
good
one
the
brewery
has
their
own
smoked
takes
on
certain
styles
and
this
is
certainly
drinkable
i
would
not
drink
more
than
one
in
a
sitting
but
this
is
more
subtle
than
their
other
offerings
the
mouthfeel
is
light
and
acidic
but
there
is
some
creaminess
i
could
easily
drink
multiple
of
these
especially
during
an
oktoberfest
party
the
mouth
feel
is
decent
the
maltyness
gives
this
beer
a
full
body
and
mouth
feel
like
i
said
this
beer
would
go
great
with
a
meal
of
smoked
meat
or
cheese
overall
this
beer
is
definitely
not
everyones
cup
of
tea
however
for
someone
like
me
who
enjoys
a
smoked
beer
every
now
and
then
this
one
is
hard
to
beat
i
have
never
had
a
beer
that
was
so
robust
in
flavor
and
aroma
every
ingredient
was
noticed
and
was
used
to
perfection
over
a
decent
beer
with
some
unique
flavors
worth
trying
d
i
had
this
by
a
fire
watching
a
movie
superb
not
sure
i
could
put
more
than
500ml
away
in
a
sitting
but
this
is
a
superb
beer
regardless
drinkability
is
ok
the
beer
drinks
nice
but
is
not
something
i
would
drink
more
then
one
of
in
a
sitting
the
taste
is
more
malty
than
the
nose
suggests
try
this
beer
one
of
the
good
rauchbiers
that
ive
had
d
a
very
interesting
beer
not
for
everyone
but
i
enjoyed
it
would
pair
wonderfully
with
some
bbq
sausage
or
sharp
and
smoky
cheese
mouthfeel
is
light
bodied
and
slick
with
good
carbonation
d
i
would
love
to
buy
this
beer
again
to
have
it
with
a
steak
or
pork
roast
but
i
wouldnt
buy
this
to
drink
in
my
leisure
a
very
very
good
beer
though
d
this
is
tough
the
beer
is
nice
to
drink
and
is
something
i
want
to
drink
but
it
is
odd
and
not
something
you
want
to
have
more
than
one
of
sure
enough
it
has
a
baconlike
taste
to
it
nice
bitter
aftertaste
great
beer
clear
dark
ruby
amber
with
a
dense
creamy
sand
colored
head
that
melts
slowly
leaving
fine
lace
behind
the
nose
is
pure
smokey
goodness
kind
of
like
smoked
ham
or
bacon
soaked
in
german
lager
the
flavor
is
pure
campfirevery
heavily
charred
malty
sweetness
with
a
faint
charcoal
bitterness
medium
bodied
with
light
fine
carbonation
a
really
big
and
good
beer
i
enjoyed
this
thoroughly
but
it
was
just
too
intense
for
a
high
drinkability
score
impressive
in
small
doses
a
deep
but
clear
mahogany
brownblack
with
a
moderate
fizzy
head
of
a
grey
brown
color
and
weakly
laced
at
best
the
aroma
brings
strong
smokey
winelike
quality
burnt
oak
deep
and
luscious
speaks
of
ham
and
licorice
clove
and
molasses
quite
nice
and
complex
the
taste
suggests
lots
more
smoke
over
molasses
in
a
near
full
bodied
brew
with
some
malt
sweetness
a
luscious
feel
to
the
tongue
smooth
and
edible
theres
a
coffee
bean
bitterness
not
a
session
brew
but
highly
enjoyable
big
time
unique
and
a
flavorful
experience
dont
miss
trying
this
smokey
treat
great
with
the
left
over
ham
mmm
d
perfect
with
smoked
sausage
the
lighter
smoke
flavor
makes
this
beer
a
bit
easier
to
take
all
alone
but
it
still
goes
best
with
smoked
meats
and
heavy
cheeses
a
very
nice
beer
this
is
a
bit
thinner
than
expected
im
enjoying
this
and
thinking
of
some
interesting
food
pairings
but
i
cant
help
thinking
this
should
have
just
a
little
more
body
drinking
though
this
is
probably
the
smoothest
of
the
schlenkerla
rauchs
although
its
been
a
long
time
since
i
drank
the
marzen
and
really
youd
have
to
have
them
all
lined
up
in
a
row
to
really
compare
them
because
the
smoke
is
always
the
dominant
factor
this
one
though
is
pretty
wellbalanced
and
very
drinkable
still
this
is
an
impressively
robust
rauch
one
that
leaves
everything
up
to
the
smoke
character
and
you
have
to
appreciate
it
for
that
drinkabilitynotes
what
a
unique
beer
a
standard
bearer
for
the
rauchbier
style
nice
and
smoky
with
charred
meat
and
fire
embers
and
hints
of
dark
fruit
hidden
in
the
wonderful
smokiness
a
great
beer
to
sip
would
be
ideal
sitting
by
the
fireplace
or
around
the
campfire
or
bbq
easy
to
drink
with
alcohol
well
hidden
a
fantastic
change
of
pace
beer
and
a
beer
the
everyone
should
at
least
try
once
though
i
will
definitey
buy
more
of
this
highly
recommended
seek
and
enjoy
i
have
a
little
cold
so
i
think
thats
why
i
cant
smell
the
intense
smoke
like
everyone
else
can
damn
conclusion
this
is
a
damn
weird
beer
my
first
of
the
style
its
odd
delicious
awesome
drinkability
one
of
these
is
highly
drinkable
especially
if
paired
well
with
food
however
more
than
one
might
let
palate
fatigue
set
in
decent
the
aftertaste
changes
from
sweet
malts
to
a
more
dry
bitterness
mixed
with
smoke
although
there
is
a
lot
af
flavour
it
still
is
a
very
drinkable
beer
smokie
smokie
looks
great
smells
smokie
taste
is
good
until
the
after
if
you
like
smokie
beers
this
one
is
good
for
you
i
dont
prefer
it
so
much
mouthfeel
is
alright
drinkability
is
no
so
great
because
of
the
smoke
having
said
all
of
that
i
do
have
to
give
props
for
this
unique
beer
i
would
drink
it
daily
but
i
did
give
it
decent
marks
because
of
the
difference
mouthfeeldrinkability
as
if
this
beer
hasnt
already
won
me
over
the
mouthfeel
only
adds
to
the
experience
and
allows
the
nuances
of
smoked
malt
molasses
and
hops
to
unfold
their
bountiful
properties
a
classic
in
every
regard
theres
something
to
be
said
for
this
brewerys
absolutely
stunning
offerings
drinkability
is
very
low
for
me
im
glad
i
tried
the
style
but
it
isnt
for
me
based
on
the
taste
im
sure
that
this
is
a
great
representation
of
the
stylye
but
again
not
for
me
maybe
ill
revisit
it
in
a
couple
years
but
for
now
no
thanks
aecht
schlenkerla
rauchbier
urbock
is
a
mouthful
not
just
the
name
but
the
beer
as
well
its
got
a
really
nice
unique
smoke
flavor
i
think
thats
the
extent
of
its
purpose
its
probably
typical
for
the
style
i
dont
have
any
prior
experience
for
comparison
for
what
it
is
its
good
i
cant
say
its
something
id
seek
out
frequently
in
a
beer
but
its
definitely
very
nice
and
should
be
experienced
by
every
ba
at
least
once
taste
smokey
beef
jerky
flavor
followed
by
a
nice
bitter
finish
smokiness
stays
on
your
palate
for
awhile
really
lovely
stuff
my
favorite
smoked
beer
fo
sho
definitely
a
different
experience
if
you
love
bacon
or
pork
you
will
like
this
beer
could
go
very
well
with
similar
tasting
foods
or
smoked
cheese
a
must
try
for
any
real
beer
fan
overwhelmig
aroma
of
wood
fireplace
at
first
then
a
smoked
sausage
aroma
no
visible
head
and
no
lacing
taste
is
very
smoky
cant
really
discern
any
other
flavor
lingers
on
the
palatte
might
work
with
the
proper
food
pairing
certainly
not
a
drinkable
beer
in
my
opinion
review
numbers
wil
bear
in
mind
that
skoked
beer
probably
is
not
my
favorite
drinkability
i
feel
sort
of
bad
giving
this
all
fives
but
truth
be
told
i
believe
this
is
the
benchmark
for
my
favorite
style
if
i
could
have
one
beer
for
the
rest
of
my
life
this
is
it
the
smoke
is
not
subtleit
is
amazing
the
other
flavors
are
very
complex
this
hides
the
alcohol
well
everything
a
rauch
should
be
everything
a
beer
should
be
this
is
the
beer
for
me
i
liked
it
a
lot
i
found
it
very
drinkable
and
well
balanced
the
smoke
taste
is
quite
powerful
ive
found
that
drinking
them
before
smoking
is
not
as
pleasurabe
as
after
d
like
all
of
the
schlenkerla
rauchbiers
this
one
is
hugely
smoky
yet
still
retains
a
high
drinkability
recommended
for
those
wanting
to
experience
a
true
german
smoked
beer
drinkabilty
to
me
this
is
a
beer
that
would
be
ideal
with
good
spicey
food
or
some
great
summer
bbq
food
to
me
of
their
three
main
beers
by
this
company
this
was
by
far
the
best
and
if
i
try
again
it
would
be
this
one
with
food
paired
up
d
very
full
unique
flavor
with
this
beer
if
you
want
something
different
this
is
it
while
i
dont
think
i
would
drink
more
than
one
of
these
at
a
time
i
would
definitely
keep
this
in
the
rotation
ive
been
wanting
to
try
a
rauchbier
for
a
while
and
i
have
to
say
i
wasnt
the
least
bit
disappointed
highly
recommended
bottle
poured
a
very
dark
brown
with
a
creamy
offwhite
head
that
dissipated
quickly
but
left
extensive
lacing
on
the
glass
intense
aroma
of
smoke
when
poured
good
flavor
of
malt
with
smoke
flavor
intense
but
not
so
it
overpowers
the
malt
flavor
clean
and
not
too
heavy
on
the
palate
excellent
drinkability
not
sessionable
imo
but
i
find
myself
wanting
to
try
these
beers
with
a
wide
range
of
food
types
to
see
what
works
and
what
doesnt
the
rauchbier
poured
darkly
into
my
tulip
glass
settling
with
a
minimal
light
head
the
aroma
wafting
from
the
glass
was
amazing
beaming
with
richly
layered
aldersmoky
cherry
malt
with
a
colatinged
edge
and
dark
fruit
esters
powerful
and
sublime
the
taste
matched
the
aroma
but
was
less
sweet
than
expected
well
balanced
delicious
colatinged
aldersmoked
malts
again
with
dark
fruit
notes
and
now
some
bacon
undertones
nice
levels
of
hoppiness
and
cola
lingered
in
satisfying
finish
carbonation
and
a
medium
smooth
body
rounded
out
the
flavors
perfectly
excellent
one
day
ill
make
my
pilgrimage
to
the
brauerei
in
bamberg
to
sample
franconias
famous
specialty
fresh
vom
fass
but
until
then
the
bottled
imports
continue
to
serve
as
a
reminder
to
mark
that
one
on
the
calendar
d
this
was
quite
good
but
i
found
it
to
be
a
bit
less
drinkable
compared
to
the
aecht
maerzen
i
will
definitely
have
this
again
though
d
very
drinkable
i
love
rauchbier
oh
and
forewarn
your
significant
other
about
the
particular
strain
that
is
the
rauchbier
fart
mouthfeel
was
smooth
up
front
but
ends
with
some
zippy
carbonation
not
too
much
though
hard
to
choose
between
this
and
the
marzen
both
are
great
got
to
love
the
rauch
the
drink
is
lightbodied
very
wellcarbonated
and
a
superb
drinker
if
you
can
stand
all
the
smoke
i
love
it
and
could
drink
the
aecht
schlenkerla
family
of
rauchbiers
all
day
any
day
there
is
really
nothing
else
like
this
in
the
world
awesome
aecht
schlenkerla
rauchbier
urbock
pours
a
dark
brown
with
a
thin
off
white
head
from
a
brown
half
liter
bottle
the
aroma
is
very
smoky
with
a
touch
of
sweet
malt
the
taste
is
very
smoky
with
a
touch
of
sweet
malt
as
well
worth
a
try
but
wont
be
to
everyones
taste
as
smoked
beers
go
this
is
one
of
the
best
deep
brown
pour
with
a
lighter
brown
head
that
dissipates
into
a
constant
ring
great
lacing
aroma
is
exactly
the
same
as
the
smell
of
a
charcoal
barbeque
grill
when
you
first
open
it
to
light
it
bacon
malt
and
oak
are
mixed
nicely
in
the
flavor
not
as
overpowering
as
the
marzen
version
i
only
wish
this
one
was
easier
to
find
d
this
is
my
very
first
rauchbier
smells
and
tastes
great
but
this
is
more
of
a
novelty
drink
to
me
than
something
that
i
could
enjoy
regularly
not
as
drinkable
as
most
lagers
i
like
it
though
and
would
buy
it
again
supposedly
the
gold
standard
of
rauchbiers
but
i
prefer
surly
smoke
nice
mahogany
color
but
not
much
of
a
head
the
nose
has
a
huge
smoked
malt
presence
over
sweet
malts
taste
is
a
nice
balance
of
smoke
and
dark
malts
medium
body
matches
style
well
a
good
exampel
of
the
style
huge
smoke
presence
nice
example
of
the
style
ruby
to
brown
pretty
big
head
on
this
one
that
leaves
some
decent
stringy
lacing
smell
and
taste
are
all
straight
woody
smoke
literally
a
burning
campfire
in
a
bottle
that
completely
overtakes
anything
else
that
might
be
in
there
interesting
at
first
but
pretty
onedimensional
this
is
a
taste
i
only
want
so
much
of
smooth
chewy
mouthfeel
though
drank
with
my
thanksgiving
turkey
i
feel
like
this
really
needs
to
be
paired
with
some
big
pungent
cheeses
or
charred
meat
poured
a
nice
brown
color
with
hints
of
ruby
and
a
small
tan
head
that
dissipated
quickly
the
aroma
was
pure
smokiness
flavor
is
dominated
by
the
woody
smoke
flavor
but
a
bit
of
grain
and
caramel
maltiness
are
detectable
mouthfeel
is
of
a
mediumbodied
beer
i
found
it
very
drinkable
and
enjoyed
it
immensely
d
all
i
need
is
a
platter
of
pulled
pork
and
some
sweet
bbq
sauce
complex
standout
beer
notes
i
can
think
of
little
better
for
a
campout
in
front
of
a
fire
i
mean
it
would
be
a
bit
like
drinking
the
campfire
itself
but
i
think
that
it
would
be
great
i
really
enjoyed
this
experience
i
went
in
a
little
nervous
and
came
out
wanting
more
such
a
unique
style
drinkability
is
great
this
is
a
very
managable
rauchbeer
without
the
harsh
smokeyness
that
some
can
exhibit
for
a
ba
who
loves
the
smoked
notes
this
ones
could
have
been
a
bit
more
assertive
in
taste
but
in
the
end
it
pays
off
with
a
more
balanced
profile
on
the
palate
a
solid
rauchbeer
cheers
this
is
definitely
the
more
robust
and
smokey
of
the
schlenkerlas
and
more
akin
to
what
i
was
hoping
for
in
a
smoked
beer
nice
but
an
acquired
taste
nonetheless
drinkable
in
the
colder
seasons
by
the
fire
in
my
opinion
and
certainly
worth
a
try
solid
4s
across
the
board
drinkability
perhaps
schlenkerla
has
slowly
worked
me
up
the
smoke
scale
to
the
point
where
i
find
this
both
pleasant
and
keenly
drinkable
but
well
i
find
it
both
pleasant
and
keenly
drinkable
the
sweetest
of
the
aecht
beers
the
aroma
is
sweet
as
well
as
smokey
the
appearance
is
a
deep
maroon
brown
and
the
head
is
smaller
than
the
other
aecht
beers
the
sweet
flavor
in
this
one
is
similar
to
molasses
the
palate
could
be
a
bit
thicker
overall
this
is
the
best
of
the
aecht
smoke
beers
but
still
very
smokey
pours
a
pleasing
chestnut
brown
with
ruby
highlights
and
a
nice
tan
head
that
unfortunately
doesnt
stick
around
for
to
long
the
smell
reminded
me
of
a
nice
islay
sotch
like
ardbeg
or
laphroaig
pungently
smokey
i
like
it
the
taste
is
fantastic
smoked
pork
nutty
cheeses
a
slight
fruitiness
followed
by
a
slight
alcohol
warmth
love
that
smokey
aftertaste
lightly
carbonated
with
smooth
mouthfeel
and
a
medium
body
that
is
on
par
for
the
style
im
going
back
tomorrow
for
a
rack
first
rauchbier
pours
a
clear
reddish
brown
with
dense
tan
head
that
fades
to
a
thin
layer
smell
smoked
gouda
smoked
pork
tavern
ham
blackenedcharred
bonfire
taste
same
smokiness
roasted
malt
caramel
a
little
coffee
munich
malt
slight
graininess
mildly
sweet
with
perhaps
a
hint
of
spicygrassy
hops
at
the
end
of
the
sip
nice
carbonation
for
a
somewhat
creamy
medium
body
this
is
quite
tasty
it
would
pair
well
with
a
wood
fire
in
the
fireplace
not
here
a
hunk
of
cheese
and
crackers
and
someone
to
split
the
500ml
with
when
i
first
tried
this
beer
i
took
a
smell
then
a
sip
then
i
walked
away
from
it
i
was
horrified
then
i
said
to
myself
i
have
never
tasted
anything
like
that
in
my
life
and
decided
i
had
to
man
up
and
drink
it
beer
pours
a
dark
burnt
brown
color
smell
the
smell
is
what
got
to
me
at
first
strong
odor
of
campfire
and
beef
jerky
the
taste
complements
the
smell
very
well
acrid
jerky
ham
and
burnt
log
taste
sounds
unappealing
but
is
very
common
for
this
style
of
beer
i
made
the
mistake
of
making
this
the
first
rauchbier
i
ever
tried
start
with
the
helles
and
work
your
way
up
to
this
one
i
give
it
a
low
drinkability
based
on
personal
preference
a
perfect
beer
to
share
and
experience
with
someone
looking
to
swim
in
unfamiliar
waters
d
a
nicely
done
beer
and
an
intriguing
and
tasty
style
i
could
enjoy
another
bottle
once
i
was
done
this
one
quite
good
the
smell
and
initial
taste
are
very
reminiscent
of
a
smoked
cheese
not
sure
if
i
like
it
but
i
dont
hate
it
definitely
can
taste
some
smoke
that
compliments
the
hops
in
a
unique
way
has
a
strong
malt
flavor
one
of
the
most
original
beers
i
have
drank
in
a
while
but
doesnt
exactly
hit
my
go
to
list
i
would
drink
it
again
and
be
happy
it
would
probably
get
better
with
the
next
beer
now
that
i
have
a
better
idea
what
to
expect
does
have
a
similar
taste
to
some
other
alt
beers
ive
had
in
a
sort
of
bitterness
at
the
end
this
was
beautiful
though
definately
have
again
d
this
is
a
fantastic
rauchbier
and
one
of
my
favorites
however
it
is
a
bit
strong
to
session
this
one
even
if
it
is
so
wonderful
d
fantastic
beer
very
drinkable
finally
a
terriffic
smoked
beer
to
compare
all
others
to
this
was
my
first
smoke
beer
and
wow
i
was
not
prepared
for
this
pours
dark
brown
with
an
offwhite
head
with
nice
thin
lacing
smell
is
huge
smoked
ham
and
bbq
the
taste
is
smoky
salty
sweetness
and
smoked
meat
this
beer
has
medium
body
and
is
nicely
carbonated
i
was
happy
drinking
the
pint
size
bottle
but
i
dont
think
i
would
drink
another
one
especially
with
the
high
price
tag
not
something
i
would
drink
on
a
regular
basis
but
certainly
worth
a
try
d
the
smokiness
gets
to
you
quickly
very
good
overall
but
suffers
a
little
bit
on
drinkability
in
the
end
this
was
my
first
smokebeer
it
was
not
as
dark
as
i
imagined
i
used
a
goblet
there
was
no
head
but
i
dont
know
if
this
is
because
i
poured
it
slow
or
not
it
took
me
longer
than
usual
to
finish
this
determined
that
smokebeer
isnt
for
me
although
i
didnt
hate
it
mouth
feel
was
lighter
than
expected
not
thick
like
a
stout
this
beer
would
probably
go
well
with
something
from
the
charcoal
grill
this
is
also
my
first
review
overall
another
excellent
rauchbier
from
schlenkerla
definitely
recommended
easily
the
most
interesting
beer
ive
ever
had
ill
most
likely
give
this
beer
and
the
style
overall
another
chance
but
the
smokiness
was
more
then
i
had
bargained
with
highly
recommended
d
a
halfliter
will
do
fine
for
me
though
i
would
like
another
paired
well
with
the
bratwurst
i
had
for
dinner
pours
a
deep
deep
brown
color
with
an
average
white
head
that
settled
into
a
light
ring
the
aroma
is
of
smoke
smoke
and
more
smoke
there
are
seared
meat
and
jerky
aromas
charcoal
wood
anything
that
resembles
a
grill
or
campfire
a
big
smoke
and
meat
flavor
punches
upfront
but
the
urbock
has
a
malt
backbone
that
punches
back
unlike
their
other
offerings
nice
char
flavor
along
with
wood
and
peat
and
rounded
out
with
a
lightly
roasted
malt
this
is
what
i
imagine
an
old
old
old
old
school
beer
tasting
like
the
feel
is
still
fairly
light
for
such
a
strong
flavored
brew
it
has
soft
carbonation
with
a
sweet
and
savory
finish
i
feel
that
i
should
be
eating
a
leg
of
cow
or
something
the
pinnacle
of
smoked
brews
cant
get
more
smokey
except
for
the
other
brews
in
their
lineup
this
one
is
tops
due
to
a
nice
malt
presence
cant
drink
a
lot
of
these
but
look
forward
to
having
one
by
my
fire
pit
come
colder
weather
in
short
this
is
a
bacon
beer
it
looks
smells
and
tastes
like
liquid
bacon
d
very
good
i
thought
once
you
get
used
to
the
style
and
this
brand
especially
all
others
will
pale
by
comparison
multiples
may
be
limited
but
one
or
two
will
be
sure
to
leave
you
satisfied
for
the
night
drinking
this
was
an
experience
and
its
unlike
anything
i
have
tried
before
i
doubt
i
would
ever
buy
it
again
but
it
is
certainly
worth
one
try
for
any
beer
geek
smokey
treat
indeed
wow
im
constantly
amazed
at
how
diverse
beer
can
be
and
this
one
is
amazingly
out
there
aroma
is
heavily
smoked
malty
and
meaty
how
could
this
not
deserve
a
10
pour
is
dark
and
opaque
creating
a
fluffy
off
white
head
leaving
generous
amounts
of
lacing
mouthfeel
is
creamy
and
surprisingly
delicate
flavor
is
in
step
with
the
aroma
smokey
and
rich
and
so
good
next
time
im
picking
up
some
meats
and
cheeses
and
having
one
hell
of
a
go
at
it
incredible
the
style
to
me
doesnt
have
inherently
high
drinkability
but
this
is
comparably
quite
smooth
enjoyable
in
the
right
setting
this
is
my
first
rachbier
and
i
have
to
say
its
way
up
there
on
my
list
of
favorite
styles
the
smokey
flavor
compliments
the
bock
flavors
well
this
brewery
has
two
others
available
in
the
mid
atlantic
the
marzen
and
a
weizen
cant
wait
for
the
marzen
beware
if
youre
vegetarian
one
whiff
of
this
and
youll
find
yourself
in
the
car
on
the
way
to
the
gas
station
to
grab
some
oberto
recommended
taste
sweet
and
roasted
malts
turn
into
smoke
quickly
leather
and
sausage
are
evident
finish
is
very
smoky
and
sends
a
bit
of
the
flavor
back
up
into
the
nostrils
after
swallowing
however
this
smokiness
isnt
like
breathing
in
a
campfire
but
more
like
standing
in
a
meat
smoker
and
sticking
your
tongue
out
very
distinct
and
not
for
the
faint
of
heart
thin
whisp
of
a
head
nut
brown
ale
color
dark
rich
flavors
help
to
balance
out
the
smoke
goes
great
with
roasted
or
cured
meats
and
nuts
at
first
you
think
the
smoke
is
going
to
be
overwhelming
but
it
always
seems
to
be
in
the
background
adding
to
the
complexity
of
the
beer
very
well
made
and
very
consistant
something
i
would
think
in
this
style
of
beer
to
be
very
difficult
though
widely
available
locally
a
rare
beer
would
like
to
see
this
in
a
cork
enclosed
750ml
for
aging
pours
a
deep
ruby
brown
and
smells
of
smokey
outdoors
quite
an
incredible
smell
that
makes
you
want
to
eat
some
smoked
sausage
has
a
decent
offwhite
head
that
sticks
around
and
leave
lacing
the
flavor
is
quite
like
the
smell
a
little
bit
of
metallic
yet
really
smokey
and
tasty
this
is
a
great
example
of
the
style
and
should
be
sought
out
if
you
have
never
had
a
smoked
beer
it
is
quite
strong
tasting
with
a
medium
to
heavy
body
i
dont
think
i
could
drink
too
many
of
these
and
my
mouth
tastes
like
i
smoked
a
cigar
when
im
finished
with
the
bottle
d
i
loved
this
beer
and
wish
i
could
easily
get
it
on
draft
here
ive
had
it
in
the
bottle
but
that
in
no
way
compares
to
the
goodness
on
tap
the
rauchbiers
from
schlenkerla
are
all
good
beers
for
certain
occasions
and
the
urbock
has
proven
to
be
a
great
match
with
grilled
meat
this
memorial
day
finely
smoothly
carbonated
a
bit
of
slickness
a
pleasure
to
drink
d
i
love
rauchbiers
and
this
is
another
damn
fine
one
from
them
that
said
1
or
2
at
a
sitting
is
the
limit
with
the
urbock
the
marzen
or
the
weizen
i
could
have
more
overall
this
is
a
really
nice
smokedbeer
my
favorite
of
the
schlenkerla
brews
pairs
nicely
with
a
smoked
cheddar
and
french
rolls
the
finish
is
very
smooth
and
its
quite
drinkable
ill
have
to
give
the
other
styles
a
chance
and
see
what
other
flavors
stand
out
that
make
them
different
we
got
a
shipment
of
the
marzen
at
my
store
and
people
always
give
me
a
strange
look
when
i
say
the
beer
tastes
like
smoked
sausage
so
i
was
very
excited
to
try
the
urbock
because
the
marzen
was
so
delicious
i
enjoyed
it
slightly
chilled
in
my
warstiener
mug
poured
a
thick
reddish
brown
color
the
nose
was
delightful
with
wonderful
smokey
malts
and
a
bit
of
an
earthy
quality
the
taste
was
heavenly
with
sweet
smoke
and
peat
staying
silky
smooth
on
the
tongue
with
a
clean
finish
one
hell
of
a
beer
good
drinkability
the
smoke
doesnt
hinder
things
in
the
way
you
might
think
and
as
you
drink
it
recedes
a
little
letting
other
flavors
shine
the
best
rauchbier
ive
had
to
date
d
im
not
often
in
the
mood
for
smoked
beers
but
this
is
one
id
like
to
have
again
d
for
what
the
beer
is
it
is
a
work
of
art
but
can
only
be
truely
appricated
once
in
a
while
this
poured
a
dark
and
clear
tan
with
fluffy
white
head
it
had
an
interesting
smell
like
smoky
malt
and
oak
it
tasted
even
more
interesting
like
hickory
smoked
ham
or
bacon
with
salty
roasted
malt
flavors
it
was
slightly
thick
with
some
carbonation
and
a
smooth
yet
strong
smoky
aftertaste
overall
this
was
extremely
unique
like
drinking
a
black
bean
and
ham
soup
with
a
porter
base
weird
this
beer
pours
a
dark
mahogany
color
the
head
is
one
inch
in
height
and
recedes
slowly
into
thick
chunky
lacing
the
aroma
is
of
smoke
bacon
and
caramel
the
taste
has
more
caramel
in
it
than
does
the
aroma
and
it
masks
some
of
the
smoke
and
bacon
the
mouthfeel
is
mediumfull
bodied
with
a
silky
texture
overall
this
is
a
great
beer
i
will
certainly
drink
this
again
with
some
good
bbq
a
wonderfully
dark
and
very
smokey
beer
blackish
with
a
foam
head
malted
down
and
average
mouthfeel
hot
dog
in
a
bottle
understated
carbonation
to
me
over
the
top
on
the
smoke
i
can
take
more
moderation
but
appreciation
for
the
craftmanship
of
what
it
is
d
this
is
my
first
experience
with
a
rauchbier
and
it
was
very
enjoyable
i
cant
say
i
will
be
craving
this
type
of
beer
every
week
but
i
will
definitely
try
this
beer
again
the
only
real
negative
is
the
price
its
always
about
3
99
per
bottle
no
matter
where
i
find
it
in
the
usa
still
a
very
solid
beer
and
a
necessary
purchase
if
youre
into
rauchbiers
well
what
can
i
say
its
a
smoked
beer
if
you
didnt
want
a
smoked
beer
then
you
shouldnt
have
bought
it
ill
reiterate
the
sentiments
of
many
of
the
other
reviewers
and
say
that
this
is
definitely
not
an
everyday
beer
however
on
the
right
occasion
i
imagine
it
could
be
downright
blissful
the
age
of
the
bottle
didnt
seem
to
do
this
sample
any
harm
although
i
cant
know
for
sure
as
ive
never
had
a
fresh
one
nevertheless
this
is
still
a
damn
good
beer
recommended
provided
you
know
what
youre
getting
into
really
good
beer
i
dont
know
why
i
havent
tried
this
sooner
as
this
beer
warms
the
malts
begin
to
shine
in
my
opinion
they
were
a
little
heavy
handed
with
the
smoked
malts
but
it
was
a
good
beer
nonetheless
the
marzen
is
still
my
favorite
from
aecht
schlenkerla
the
only
problem
was
a
slight
mustiness
that
is
present
im
not
sure
if
that
is
normal
or
not
i
got
this
bottle
from
discount
liquor
in
milwaukee
i
really
enjoyed
the
taste
but
even
this
bottle
grew
tiresome
to
drink
i
think
its
just
too
much
smokey
flavor
finish
is
dry
and
smokey
carbonation
is
modest
pretty
mellow
and
easy
to
drink
md
mildly
spritzy
and
softly
textured
this
beer
drinks
absolutely
great
smooth
and
refreshing
with
a
full
body
yet
very
little
hint
of
alc
having
tried
the
draught
version
last
month
at
the
nwaf
2008
that
was
spoton
i
first
had
some
reservation
about
this
bottled
version
but
now
its
proved
to
be
almost
just
as
nice
for
me
this
is
a
moreish
smoked
beer
and
a
brilliant
drink
drinkability
if
you
like
a
smokebeer
not
too
hard
to
knock
a
couple
of
these
back
prosit
from
a
brewery
that
specializes
in
worldclass
smoked
beers
this
along
with
their
marzen
are
probably
some
of
the
best
smoked
beers
in
the
world
this
one
certainly
lives
up
to
the
reputation
pours
a
jetblack
ebony
color
with
slighttan
head
smell
is
all
smoked
flavors
with
dark
warming
grainy
fishlike
aroma
taste
is
very
thick
rich
and
full
of
intricate
smoked
flavors
as
expected
the
smoked
flavor
is
very
pronounced
and
hardhitting
it
really
comes
through
would
be
a
great
beer
to
pair
with
meats
and
other
smoked
foods
perhaps
sushi
an
allaround
outstanding
brew
good
mouthfeel
average
drinkability
due
to
the
rich
thick
flavor
very
flavorful
brew
an
amazing
depiction
of
the
style
if
you
like
smoked
beers
you
will
love
this
one
cant
get
much
closer
to
a
great
representation
of
the
style
recommended
d
not
for
everyone
but
personally
i
love
it
not
something
to
drink
all
the
time
just
a
treat
every
now
and
then
pours
a
deep
brown
with
thin
tannish
head
nose
is
a
little
smokey
but
not
that
much
i
really
had
to
sniff
to
get
some
good
nose
taste
was
smokey
the
moment
it
hits
the
mouth
and
down
it
tasted
of
smoke
and
something
else
i
could
not
put
my
finger
on
someone
below
aid
ham
and
that
seems
pretty
close
some
type
of
meat
overallit
lived
up
to
its
name
and
it
was
different
for
me
good
beer
and
a
great
beer
for
a
change
of
pace
bottle
poured
a
deep
brown
color
ale
with
a
big
foamy
head
with
good
retention
and
some
lacing
aroma
is
totally
dominated
by
smoked
ham
notes
with
some
malt
taste
is
also
dominated
by
some
smoked
bacon
notes
with
some
nice
malt
backbone
body
is
full
with
limited
filtration
and
good
carbonation
i
am
not
sure
if
i
am
getting
used
to
drinking
smoke
beer
but
i
thought
this
went
down
better
then
the
marzen
that
i
had
a
year
or
two
ago
pours
deep
deep
brown
with
slight
hints
of
red
very
nice
three
finger
head
tan
with
brown
highlights
the
aromas
are
subtle
hints
of
smoked
candied
fruit
the
beer
is
very
smooth
smoky
raisin
like
flovors
the
beer
is
not
deep
with
flavor
it
seems
a
bit
hollow
the
finish
is
thick
almost
like
a
barley
wine
its
a
decent
brew
d
this
is
a
very
particularized
beer
for
me
i
really
like
it
but
can
only
imagine
a
couple
occasions
where
i
would
choose
it
because
its
style
is
so
distinctive
not
for
everyday
drinking
but
is
tasty
d
my
first
true
experience
with
this
style
and
it
was
not
bad
at
all
really
met
my
expectations
of
the
style
though
i
cant
say
this
is
a
beer
id
reach
for
every
time
the
time
drinking
this
was
enjoyable
i
love
smoked
meats
the
smell
of
smoke
i
own
a
smoker
and
get
grilling
quite
often
so
naturally
i
thought
smoked
beer
that
sounds
great
wrong
ladies
and
gentlemen
this
is
the
first
beer
i
have
ever
ever
poured
down
the
drain
smelled
good
though
smoky
d
light
body
moderate
abv
and
complex
flavors
with
a
clean
finish
thats
a
nice
recipe
for
a
very
drinkable
beer
personal
score
88100
d
obviously
this
would
be
perfect
with
some
good
bbq
but
also
good
on
its
own
couldnt
drink
every
day
but
a
nice
treat
overall
i
love
the
smokiness
that
comes
through
i
dont
like
the
off
notes
in
the
nose
and
taste
ill
have
to
try
this
one
again
sometime
i
had
a
hard
time
drinking
more
than
8
oz
of
this
do
not
get
me
wrong
i
liked
it
but
plan
to
buy
this
one
for
a
bbq
and
serve
small
amounts
in
a
snifter
glass
to
everyone
poured
this
into
my
great
taste
of
the
midwest
glass
because
its
the
only
cylinder
shaped
glass
i
have
and
i
dont
want
to
pour
this
into
a
2
liter
mug
pours
a
dark
brown
color
with
a
thick
light
brown
head
the
lacing
is
strong
smell
is
sweet
burnt
wood
that
reminds
me
of
pork
there
is
also
a
small
background
of
sweet
dark
malts
the
taste
is
smokey
burnt
flavors
with
a
slight
roasty
maltiness
really
reminds
me
of
smoked
pork
mouthfeel
is
good
and
smooth
overall
this
is
a
great
beer
and
i
will
have
this
again
ive
loved
making
bbq
sauce
with
it
a
nice
one
to
pair
with
the
obvious
smoked
meats
my
favorite
of
the
three
rauchbiers
ive
had
from
this
brewery
drinkable
for
style
though
still
a
special
occassion
brew
poured
a
very
dark
brown
almost
black
with
a
thin
head
the
nose
is
of
smokey
sausage
up
front
but
it
is
maltier
on
the
back
end
even
slightly
winey
taste
is
similar
slightly
spicy
and
nicely
smokey
up
front
without
being
overpowering
then
a
hit
of
dry
malt
with
a
touch
of
sweetness
and
a
deep
smokiness
on
the
finish
complex
interplay
of
the
malt
and
smoke
make
this
beer
delicious
and
intriguing
very
smooth
mouthfeel
medium
bodied
very
nice
example
of
a
rauchbier
and
although
smokey
it
is
kept
nicely
balnced
so
that
the
tastebuds
arent
quickly
worn
out
a
killer
food
beer
dark
brown
with
amber
highlights
and
a
dense
creamy
onefinger
head
the
nose
is
dominated
by
a
campfire
smokiness
and
just
beyond
is
some
floral
and
fruity
notes
here
and
there
and
a
little
alcohol
ester
smoked
malts
really
cover
the
regular
malt
characters
initially
but
some
sweetness
comes
through
as
it
warms
tartness
in
the
background
light
anise
notes
earthy
and
bitter
hops
ate
the
end
burnt
sugar
to
molasses
sweetness
becomes
more
evident
the
finish
is
primarily
smokey
flavors
chary
and
bitter
nice
full
mouthfeel
with
a
creamy
build
and
a
crispness
just
before
its
gone
drinkability
definitely
a
good
pairer
about
to
have
some
chili
with
this
i
would
love
this
by
the
campfire
or
any
bbq
highly
recommended
this
beer
is
a
pretty
solid
rauchbier
poured
a
dark
amber
color
with
a
small
tan
head
unfortunately
there
was
very
small
retention
and
no
real
lacing
worth
mentioning
the
smell
was
very
nice
and
smoky
reminding
me
of
wooden
embers
being
snuffed
out
at
the
end
of
a
big
bonfire
the
taste
was
equally
as
smoky
reminding
me
a
little
bit
of
burnt
bacon
and
again
the
taste
of
the
embers
the
mouthfeel
was
nice
and
fullbodied
and
it
went
down
pretty
smooth
while
i
am
usually
a
fan
of
rauchbiers
halfway
through
this
one
i
was
not
really
enjoying
it
so
much
anymore
it
did
not
really
have
me
asking
the
bartender
for
another
one
i
would
definitely
give
it
a
go
especially
when
i
was
out
camping
all
in
all
the
only
problem
is
that
its
such
a
treat
that
i
couldnt
see
myself
drinking
a
whole
lot
of
it
opinion
this
beer
is
a
nice
experience
it
is
not
one
that
i
would
drink
all
the
time
not
even
if
i
lived
in
bamberg
but
it
has
a
unique
flavor
that
i
would
certainly
like
to
try
somewhat
frequently
to
keep
my
palate
in
check
it
is
not
for
the
faint
of
palate
but
it
is
a
stamp
in
history
that
everyone
should
at
least
try
once
to
see
if
they
either
love
it
or
hate
it
it
definitely
was
a
new
flavor
for
me
and
i
loved
it
especially
with
the
sausages
we
were
eating
at
the
time
this
one
is
a
great
addition
to
my
beer
collection
and
flavors
i
can
add
to
the
list
definition
of
a
rauchbier
in
my
opinion
if
youre
interested
in
the
style
this
is
the
one
to
get
taste
is
quite
unique
and
special
i
think
i
am
drinking
a
bbq
smoked
liquid
or
something
of
course
you
feel
the
smoked
malt
presence
of
the
beers
followed
by
some
spices
and
shy
hops
everything
is
surrounded
by
a
shy
but
warming
alcohol
flavours
i
would
recommend
pairing
this
with
a
plate
of
smoked
salmon
or
meats
smoked
cheeses
and
dark
bread
oelergud
less
smoky
in
the
flavor
as
i
believe
is
usually
the
case
but
this
is
a
good
thing
there
is
an
amazing
balance
between
the
smoke
and
the
rich
malty
qualities
that
makes
this
really
remarkable
got
a
light
the
pour
was
a
darker
brown
color
with
amber
highlights
a
good
pour
left
a
foamy
head
that
had
limited
retention
the
nose
is
interesting
with
a
grainy
malt
presence
that
mixes
with
the
smokiness
of
the
beer
the
smoke
is
unique
with
more
of
a
meaty
or
jerky
like
aroma
to
it
the
taste
is
different
from
what
the
nose
would
indicate
there
is
a
sweet
malt
flavor
upfront
with
some
almost
molasses
like
tastes
to
it
the
smokiness
is
still
there
with
a
more
meaty
flavor
but
balances
well
with
the
beer
overall
a
light
roasty
finish
only
accentuates
the
meaty
presence
the
body
is
full
with
a
under
attenuated
feel
the
carbonation
is
light
but
does
leave
a
smoke
finish
that
is
great
for
a
bbq
afternoon
in
the
backyard
somewhere
there
is
probably
an
old
german
man
who
puts
away
six
of
these
with
dinner
he
is
a
much
much
bigger
man
than
me
the
alcohol
is
only
at
6
5
yet
this
beer
drinks
much
bigger
than
that
it
has
really
captured
what
in
my
mind
is
a
chewy
bock
like
character
i
have
been
semiregularly
brewing
a
rauch
märzen
because
of
sampling
this
and
spezials
beer
fresh
at
the
source
i
have
been
toying
with
brewing
a
bock
version
for
the
last
couple
years
and
this
has
sealed
the
deal
i
definitely
need
to
brew
a
couple
kegs
of
this
up
this
is
just
so
damn
tasty
and
wonderful
d
this
is
what
a
smoked
ale
is
all
about
big
on
flavor
and
big
on
smoke
i
love
this
style
and
this
is
the
standard
for
all
others
to
build
upon
recommeded
nevertheless
the
entire
flavor
experience
is
such
that
i
find
this
beer
quite
enjoyable
and
id
gladly
order
another
bottle
but
i
wouldnt
walk
a
mile
for
it
i
bet
this
beer
would
be
bad
ass
with
some
smoked
pork
product
i
dont
eat
pork
but
i
might
try
pairing
andor
marinating
it
with
some
beef
sausage
one
of
these
days
pours
out
of
the
half
litre
bottle
a
deep
garnet
colour
with
a
thick
but
fine
head
very
little
laciness
intense
smoke
aroma
not
overpowering
but
definitely
the
star
of
this
brew
some
underlying
maltiness
sweet
notes
of
caramel
and
chocolate
the
charred
flavours
and
smokiness
in
the
taste
profile
intermingle
quite
nicely
with
a
neatly
balanced
malt
bill
sweet
toffee
and
caramel
some
choco
and
coffee
flavours
on
display
all
accompanied
by
the
all
ever
present
delicious
smokiness
that
makes
this
bock
beer
outstanding
its
layered
and
complex
mouthfeel
is
about
perfect
and
the
body
is
about
perfect
for
a
bock
style
finishes
dry
drinkability
is
very
good
although
one
might
want
to
pair
this
with
some
sort
of
cured
meats
and
bold
cheeses
on
its
own
a
half
litre
or
maybe
a
full
litre
might
be
enough
at
one
time
i
like
this
beer
and
will
revisit
it
again
under
the
right
circumstances
yummy
stuff
d
i
needed
a
long
time
to
warm
up
to
this
style
as
i
have
grown
to
appreciate
it
i
find
that
few
beers
are
so
filling
but
the
smokiness
is
definitely
an
acquired
taste
d
god
i
love
these
beers
dark
maple
syrup
amberbrown
with
a
creamy
persistent
light
khaki
head
that
laces
well
nose
is
wonderfully
smoky
smoked
ham
and
other
assorted
meats
come
to
mind
delightful
campfire
works
too
i
can
pick
up
some
caramelly
malt
amidst
the
smokiness
but
its
a
bit
onedimensional
sweetish
malt
flavors
up
front
before
the
smoky
meat
settles
in
i
really
like
the
sweetsmokesalt
dynamic
in
this
beer
finish
is
smoky
and
slightly
bitter
yum
medium
bodied
with
a
smooth
gentle
feel
very
good
beer
drinkability
a
perfect
beer
for
bbq
beef
or
ribs
but
by
itself
it
is
still
a
nicely
drinkable
beer
poured
from
a
500ml
bottle
into
my
imperial
pint
glass
a
dark
amberbrown
color
with
about
two
fingers
of
off
white
head
smells
of
smoked
ham
smokey
bacon
beef
jerky
roasted
toasty
malts
tastes
almost
just
as
it
smells
smoked
meaty
flavors
prevail
with
a
nice
touch
of
malt
sweetness
medium
bodied
with
a
slightly
bitter
smokey
aftertaste
another
great
rauch
from
schlenkerla
i
enjoyed
this
beer
with
a
nice
smokey
pulled
pork
bbq
sandwich
it
paired
beautifully
the
smoked
aroma
is
extra
meaty
on
this
one
tall
froathy
cream
colored
head
holds
strong
dark
chestnut
colored
beer
with
an
amber
hue
chocolate
and
dark
malt
in
the
flavor
along
with
some
smoked
wood
towards
the
finish
moderately
sweet
with
just
a
hint
of
hop
bitterness
in
the
finish
the
marzen
was
the
first
for
me
so
i
compare
the
other
smoked
beers
to
it
the
smoked
aroma
is
stronger
but
the
taste
is
weaker
dont
get
me
wrong
there
is
plenty
of
flavor
but
its
less
intense
my
recommendation
is
have
at
it
wow
gotta
go
buy
another
one
of
these
unlike
their
smoked
marzen
which
is
too
concerned
with
putting
up
a
proper
front
of
beeriness
to
really
let
loose
hellertrums
smoked
urbock
cranks
the
smoke
up
to
11
for
those
of
us
who
like
a
smokey
smoke
beer
this
one
is
a
musttry
this
paired
soooo
fin
welll
with
hickory
farms
smoked
summer
sousage
with
hickory
farms
smoked
cheddar
and
swiss
on
top
on
ritz
crackers
mmnn
damn
good
also
this
beer
cooks
very
well
i
made
a
excellent
batch
of
chili
with
this
beer
drinkability
is
only
average
for
this
powerful
beer
the
flavors
are
delicious
but
this
sytle
easily
overpowers
the
palate
after
one
bottle
this
is
a
fantastic
beer
if
you
are
not
a
smoker
do
not
hesitate
to
try
it
although
it
definitely
smells
like
smoke
it
is
more
like
woodfired
oven
smoke
than
say
cigars
or
cigarettes
a
very
good
example
of
the
style
likely
the
best
i
have
had
outside
of
germany
what
an
amazing
beer
i
was
blown
away
by
the
weizen
but
that
did
not
prepare
me
for
this
wonderful
flavor
i
cant
wait
to
try
the
marzen
a
big
distinctive
brew
that
nevertheless
seems
well
balanced
not
too
sweet
and
not
too
bitter
but
still
full
in
body
and
flavor
a
beer
that
really
delivers
loads
of
flavor
without
slamming
you
on
the
head
with
big
sweet
malt
or
bitter
hops
it
also
paired
very
well
with
my
homemade
barbeque
ribs
hell
yeah
this
is
probably
not
for
me
perhaps
its
just
that
i
dont
find
smokey
things
particularly
attractive
im
sure
with
some
experience
and
practice
i
could
learn
to
feign
interest
in
it
but
i
doubt
ill
give
this
style
much
of
a
chance
overall
if
you
do
not
like
smoke
beer
this
is
a
try
to
say
you
have
had
otherwise
if
you
like
smoke
beer
this
is
a
nice
interpretation
of
one
a
must
have
the
flavor
is
a
blend
of
the
traditional
bock
characteristics
which
are
tasty
on
their
own
bready
malts
some
spice
alcohol
plus
a
full
blown
hickory
smoke
flavor
very
assertive
and
powerful
as
a
oneshot
this
is
great
any
more
than
one
however
and
you
may
become
sick
both
of
the
flavor
and
to
your
stomach
still
it
tastes
awesome
and
is
a
really
unique
and
great
brew
i
have
been
putting
this
one
of
for
a
while
in
fear
of
how
it
would
taste
turns
out
its
pretty
darn
good
i
think
i
will
have
to
get
more
of
this
during
the
summer
time
while
im
grilling
meat
warm
chewy
mouthfeel
but
then
it
tastes
like
im
eating
a
piece
of
meat
so
why
shouldnt
it
feel
like
it
too
definitely
an
acquired
taste
as
the
description
states
decent
drinkability
but
i
doubt
i
could
drink
more
than
one
on
a
night
very
easy
to
drink
with
smoked
sausages
the
prototypical
smoked
beer
had
this
on
tap
at
the
map
room
in
chicago
and
its
the
beer
i
remember
the
best
because
of
how
interesting
and
delicious
it
was
poured
very
dark
into
a
schlenkerla
glass
with
big
lacing
and
a
large
white
head
odor
was
of
smoke
hickory
wood
and
malts
taste
is
fantastically
jerkolicious
super
beefy
smokiness
nice
malt
underneath
makes
it
so
its
not
just
a
onetrick
pony
im
always
amazed
when
i
have
a
good
rauchbier
about
how
you
can
make
a
beer
taste
like
this
very
full
and
excellent
drinakability
makes
me
think
im
sitting
by
a
fire
mmmm
pours
a
darkish
brownred
without
much
head
lacing
shows
up
down
the
glass
smell
is
of
smoky
meat
extra
smokey
bacon
was
my
first
thought
tastes
of
smoke
and
a
little
malt
has
a
slight
peaty
flavor
really
quite
smokey
slight
bitter
finish
this
is
my
first
rauchbier
and
boy
is
it
like
nothing
else
still
not
sure
if
it
is
a
style
for
me
drinkability
is
limited
because
of
the
strong
smoke
if
you
like
real
smokey
flavors
i
think
you
would
really
enjoy
this
it
was
a
little
too
extreme
in
the
smokiness
for
me
but
i
am
glad
i
tried
it
its
fairly
bitter
actually
and
theres
a
good
amount
of
malty
sweetness
floating
around
under
the
smoke
flavors
the
smoke
is
prevelent
enough
that
i
cant
really
imagine
what
the
beer
would
taste
like
without
it
but
i
doubt
it
is
meant
to
be
a
beer
with
a
smokey
hint
its
a
smoke
beast
and
i
love
it
another
great
smoked
beer
from
this
brewery
quite
similar
to
the
marzen
with
a
little
less
overall
smokiness
if
thats
possible
a
slight
notion
of
hops
and
a
bit
sweeter
at
the
finish
quite
enjoyable
and
drinkable
note
everything
here
save
the
drinkability
was
reviewed
to
style
its
taste
was
not
a
pleasant
smokiness
unlike
the
aroma
drinkability
im
gonna
do
this
again
but
not
terribly
often
this
is
a
very
interesting
libation
that
will
be
reserved
for
special
and
smoky
occasions
here
at
chez
jeff
what
a
stupid
concept
for
a
beer
style
lets
make
a
beer
that
tastes
like
burnt
meat
i
like
it
though
it
works
somehow
this
drinks
a
lot
easier
with
some
bbq
or
some
other
complimentry
food
add
another
51
point
when
you
drink
this
in
bamberg
on
draftoutta
the
barrel
drinking
a
half
liter
at
the
source
with
a
nice
schweinhaxen
some
other
franconian
goodies
takes
it
to
a
straight
across
the
boards
5
this
the
gold
stanard
for
rauch
biers
imo
although
they
have
serveral
respectable
rivals
in
bamberg
had
this
bottled
many
times
in
germany
this
bottle
was
as
good
as
any
i
had
there
a
world
classic
pours
a
deep
reddish
brown
color
with
a
large
offwhite
head
smells
strongly
of
smoke
reminds
me
of
bacon
like
the
smell
the
taste
is
dominated
by
the
smoke
flavor
a
friend
once
said
the
beer
reminded
him
of
liquid
bacon
the
mouth
is
pretty
good
with
good
carbination
a
good
introduction
to
smoked
beer
but
not
for
everyone
i
love
this
beer
with
brats
or
any
grilled
meat
also
try
it
as
a
turkey
marinadebasting
liquid
works
quite
well
great
beer
from
an
oldworld
style
this
one
beer
makes
me
wish
that
there
were
more
rauchbiers
available
overall
i
am
surprised
and
might
have
to
try
this
style
again
sometime
drinkabilitynotes
quite
excellent
although
not
a
session
beer
would
likely
pair
exceptionally
well
with
barbecue
or
smoked
meats
and
strong
cheeses
as
far
as
the
style
goes
i
would
say
this
is
one
of
the
better
smoke
brews
ive
had
d
its
fairly
bold
but
the
drinkability
is
decent
drinkability
is
not
bad
great
for
the
style
prosit
mk
i
must
say
the
mere
mention
of
smoke
in
the
description
of
this
one
was
what
drew
me
in
very
intriguing
at
first
until
i
took
a
whiff
of
it
extremely
strong
smell
of
liquid
smoke
which
for
some
may
make
it
unbearable
very
dark
brownalmost
black
in
color
with
very
little
foam
or
lacing
albeit
the
glass
given
to
me
was
much
too
small
for
the
0
5
liter
bottle
as
for
taste
and
mouthfeel
this
was
my
first
smokebeer
so
i
was
taken
aback
by
the
flavors
a
bit
if
you
can
get
past
the
intense
burnt
wood
smell
you
will
notice
that
the
beer
itself
is
rather
smooth
malty
and
quite
crisp
very
light
on
the
tongue
yet
chewy
at
the
same
time
if
you
can
believe
that
as
for
drinkability
this
is
definitely
not
a
session
beer
and
it
should
definitely
be
paired
with
something
grilled
on
the
backyard
bbq
the
smokiness
would
go
well
with
steaks
and
ribs
its
crispness
and
levity
would
go
well
with
chicken
and
pork
overall
though
at
8
a
bottle
once
and
done
is
enough
for
me
the
first
time
i
reviewed
this
beer
above
i
was
not
ready
for
or
expecting
the
intense
smokey
flavor
of
a
rauchbier
i
recently
revisited
this
one
and
enjoyed
it
much
more
than
i
thought
i
would
i
am
starting
to
develop
a
taste
for
rauchbiers
as
long
as
you
know
ahead
of
time
what
to
excpect
schlenkerlas
urbock
is
a
damn
fine
brew
i
have
reevaluated
my
scoring

i
gave
this
3

and
1

respectively
for
a

drinkability
drinkable
both
as
a
bock
and
as
a
smokebeer
malts
and
smoke
balance
each
other
well
and
neither
overwhelms
the
palate
slightly
lighter
body
supports
the
complex
cross
of
flavors
sessionable
for
smoke
beer
fans
overall
a
pretty
tasty
smoked
bock
i
think
i
prefer
new
glarus
smoked
rye
bock
with
its
complexity
but
this
is
tasty
nonetheless
a
bottle
or
two
would
probably
be
it
for
me
though
delicious
maltiness
and
unique
mesquite
smokey
character
a
nice
fullflavored
bock
on
its
own
but
the
smoked
barbecue
quality
makes
this
one
quite
dynamic
this
crap
was
horrible
pleasing
appearance
with
ruby
red
highlights
in
the
midst
of
coffeedark
brown
with
a
wheatcolored
head
that
sticks
around
in
the
form
of
a
substantial
ring
huge
smoke
aroma
like
smoked
gouda
cheese
dominates
but
theres
a
discernable
sweet
malt
backing
typical
of
any
german
bock
on
the
palate
the
smoke
is
there
and
up
front
but
the
initial
taste
of
this
beer
is
quite
sweet
with
bocky
malts
molasses
big
time
showing
through
the
smoke
mixes
well
with
those
malts
in
the
midpalate
while
the
finish
switches
with
a
snap
over
to
pure
smoke
the
finish
holds
on
for
a
while
pretty
smooth
mouthfeel
owing
to
the
huge
malt
component
but
drinkability
without
a
food
to
match
this
with
is
pretty
low
without
that
the
smoke
is
a
bit
much
for
me
to
down
a
whole
500
ml
bottle
drinkability
damn
good
the
pour
is
dark
brown
almost
black
for
some
reason
i
was
thinking
this
would
be
like
a
maibock
yes
i
was
very
suprised
when
i
smelled
what
reminded
me
of
a
smokehouse
surprised
but
very
pleased
i
love
smoked
beers
initial
taste
reminds
me
of
the
skin
on
a
burnt
sausage
i
get
raw
unsweetened
caramel
as
well
and
maybe
a
hint
of
burnt
sugar
mouth
is
medium
i
could
certainly
see
myself
buying
this
again
from
time
to
time
i
greatly
enjoyed
this
beer
a
very
nice
beer
the
smoke
does
not
dominate
the
taste
this
is
suprisingly
accessible

this

a

to
go
along
with
stews
chilis
bbq
and
cigars
whenever
im
at
a
good
beer
bar
i
cant
leave
without
having
one
big
half
liter
german
bottle
with
no
freshness
date
it
pours
an
ambercopper
color
with
some
hefty
carbonation
that
builds
up
to
a
finger
of
tan
head
that
is
creamy
and
leaves
a
nice
thin
layer
of
foam
the
aromas
are
beechwood
smoke
smoked
salmon
and
bacon
along
with
some
pale
malts
and
faint
hops
it
leaves
lots
of
smoke
on
the
palate
along
with
a
big
malt
sweetness
sweet
smoke
toasted
malts
and
faint

hops
that
contribute
a
mild
bitterness
the
body
is
medium
to
full
and
quite
smooth
with
the
taste
leaving
a
long
finish
my
second
offering
from
this
brewery
and
i
must
say
i
prefer
their
märzen
over
this
one
however
any
rauchbier
is
a
welcome
change
of
pace
especially
from
hellertrum
poured
a
clear
deep
rich
amber
with
a
fluffy
quite
sticky
two
finger
white
headwhoo
the
smoke
is
huge
on
the
nose
like
black
forest
ham
smokey
with
hints
of
brown
sugar
but
man
iam
tellin
ya
its
like
smoked
ham
unbelievable
now
iam
the
first
one
to
say
iam
not
a
big
fan
of
smoked
beers
yet
they
still
intrigue
medrinking
this
was
like
drinking
a
smoked
ham
hock
with
an
underlying
brown
sugarlike
sweetness
but
not
overly
sweet
a
nice
almost
salty
finish
this
woud
have
to
be
the
perfect
pair
with
hickory
smoked
pork
i
mean
what
could
be
better
i
could
see
basting
a
shoulder
with
thisunique
and
i
enjoyed
this
beer
somewhat
i
could
drink
a
ton
of
these
i
wouldnt
say
that
ive
become
obsessed
with
smoked
beers
but
i
have
recently
become
utterly
fascinated
with
them
ive
had
the
schlenkerla
marzen
dozens
of
times
but
this
was
my
first
taste
of
the
urbock
the
aroma
is
welcomingly
smoky
fresh
and
intense
my
wife
said
that
she
could
smell
it
from
several
feet
away
when
i
opened
the
bottle
wonderful
the
intensity
however
isnt
great
enough
to
overwhelm
a
rich
malty
aroma
thats
hidden
underneath
the
color
is
a
deep
amberbrown
with
a
sticky
tan
head
similar
to
the
aroma
theres
smoke
at
the
center
of
the
taste
its
got
a
peppery
tingle
on
the
tongue
but
it
doesnt
completely
eclipse
the
malt
good
sweetness
and
a
notable
malt
flavor
bitterness
is
in
the
finish
but
you
cant
really
taste
the
hops
through
the
smoke
i
love
these
beers
this
is
a
beer
with
good
drinkability
especially
if
you
are
into
this
style
of
beer
truly
a
treat
thanks
to
rick
for
popping
the
bottle
drinkability
for
me
is
unfortunately
low
i
like
the
beer
very
much
but
its
just
one
of
those
items
id
like
10oz
of
rather
than
20oz
its
one
of
those
beers
that
would
make
a
good
one
to
split
at
the
end
of
the
night
but
this
is
the
opposite
of
a
session
beer
imo
pours
a
translucent
brown
with
a
nice
tan
head
the
aroma
is
intense
with
big
roasted
malt
smoked
bacon
floral
hops
and
some
slight
sweetness
the
flavor
is
also
initially
roasty
followed
by
some
big
smoked
meats
bacon
beef
jerky
some
coffee
caramel
floral
hops
and
some
alcohol
the
mouthfeel
is
on
the
light
side
but
appropriate
for
the
style
with
moderate
carbonation
drinkability
is
good
for
a
beer
with
a
huge
malt
profile
this
is
my
first
rauchbier
but
it
was
excellent
nothing
gimmicky
about
this
beer
all
of
these
rauchbiers
by
schlenkerla
are
worth
trying
yes
similar
in
taste
in
style
but
very
pecuilar
in
their
own
right
a
good
beer
almost
tastes
like
a
stout
but
feels
alot
lighter
and
looks
like
a
brown
ale
id
love
to
drink
this
beer
again
poured
from
a
bottle
overflowing
with
foam
into
my
new
belgium
globe
glass
it
is
a
rubyalmost
black
and
started
off
with
a
tan
creamy
head
that
just
didnt
last
very
long
although
leaving
a
chunky
lacing
could
have
fooled
me
into
believing
that
this
was
a
stout
my
first
whiff
of
this
hit
me
as
if
i
had
a
glass
full
of
bacon
the
more
my
nose
gets
acclimated
the
more
i
smell
the
dark
sweet
malts
and
some
herbal
hops
tastes
like
a
campfire
with
a
sweet
malty
backbone
and
good
bittering
hops
in
the
finish
kind
of
hard
to
pick
out
complexities
in
this
as
the
smoke
is
so
forceful
although
the
malt
is
sturdy
enough
not
to
let
the
smoke
completely
take
over
alcohol
becomes
a
bit
apparent
as
it
warms
still
this
is
tasty
mouthfeel
is
creamy
and
does
not
weigh
the
tongue
down
delicious
and
unique
beer
mouthfeel
is
quite
pleasant
i
could
see
sitting
around
doing
some
serious
rauchbier
drinking
with
friends
or
having
this
as
a
great
compliment
to
a
really
good
steak
or
a
christmas
ham
much
easier
to
drink
than
the
marzen
they
are
each
highly
recommended
in
their
own
way
great
brew
one
of
the
best
smoked
beers
out
there
very
drinkable
even
with
an
intense
but
smooth
smokiness
and
damn
tasty
highly
recommended
i
think
ill
have
to
pick
up
their
marzen
rauchbier
tomorrow
first
rauchbier
since
i
quit
smoking
still
didnt
make
a
difference
this
was
powerful
smoke
nice
brownred
white
a
sticky
white
head
and
some
lace
a
smell
of
campfire
clothes
and
malty
sweetness
that
has
plenty
of
presence
wild
and
phenolic
it
is
like
a
fire
racing
across
my
touch
burning
out
any
other
tastes
nice
sweetness
in
the
aftertaste
balances
the
smoke
rising
from
my
tongue
a
body
like
a
good
bock
no
complaint
a
little
challenging
in
the
first
few
sips
but
rewarding
and
pleasing
the
rest
of
the
way
through
drinkability
overall
this
made
for
a
very
nice
beer
but
only
a
beer
that
would
be
only
good
once
in
a
while
no
way
i
could
drink
this
on
a
regular
basis
its
too
thick
with
smoked
meats
d
eminently
drinkable
more
because
of
the
smokey
smoothness
than
in
spite
of
it
id
very
much
like
to
make
this
a
regular
with
smoked
foods
and
grilled
meats
drinkability
im
going
to
say
that
this
is
not
one
ill
often
return
to
it
doesnt
work
as
a
session
beer
and
i
dont
think
that
is
its
aim
overall
this
is
a
whole
lot
of
beer
intensely
flavorful
rich
and
complex
not
an
every
day
beer
but
it
might
be
great
for
special
occasions
next
time
i
have
one
of
these
i
will
have
it
with
smoked
ham
on
dark
rye
with
some
nutty
swiss
and
good
spicey
german
mustard
mmmm
i
was
pleasantly
surpised
should
be
a
great
addition
to
a
marinade
if
this
is
beechwood
flavor
i
need
to
get
some
to
grill
with
all
in
all
far
and
away
the
most
interesting
beer
i
have
ever
tasted
the
style
is
utterly
unique
and
a
distinct
slap
to
the
palate
i
will
endeavour
to
seek
out
more
of
this
style
drinkability
is
the
only
drawback
this
is
an
acquired
taste
fortunately
i
am
one
who
loves
this
style
but
even
i
can
only
have
so
much
this
is
a
very
welcome
departure
from
some
of
the
most
prevalent
beer
styles
every
beer
lover
should
try
this
at
least
once
aecht
schlenkerla
rauchbier
urbock
is
the
big
kahuna
the
head
honcho
the
top
dog
not
only
of
the
brauerei
hellertrum
lineup
but
of
all
rauchbiers
the
world
over
it
manages
to
combine
an
eyewatering
palateflooding
amount
of
smokiness
with
a
superbly
crafted
urbock
the
result
of
which
is
a
transcendant
drinking
experience
that
one
is
unlikely
to
find
anywhere
else
a
nice
tan
head
forms
on
top
of
a
very
dark
brown
beer
light
barely
penetrates
on
the
edges
as
with
all
of
schlenkerlas
beers
the
aroma
explodes
out
of
your
glass
filled
with
an
intense
smokiness
that
dominates
and
imparts
a
meaty
aroma
as
a
result
in
the
background
is
a
definite
malt
background
holding
everything
together
the
taste
is
more
of
the
same
delivered
on
a
wave
of
startlingly
strong
carbonation
an
intense
smokiness
lets
call
it
bacon
the
malt
base
comes
through
in
the
finish
with
a
slight
sweetness
and
seems
to
hold
everything
together
after
the
swallow
these
tastes
wrap
around
your
tongue
like
a
blanket
ensuring
their
enjoyment
for
a
long
time
if
you
enjoy
rauchbiers
this
one
goes
down
very
easily
my
preference
is
for
their
marzen
because
it
seems
to
have
a
more
complex
malt
element
but
this
is
a
great
beer
in
its
own
right
that
said
this
beer
is
more
drinkable
than
the
marzen
the
all
important
question
is
not
nature
vs
nurture
its
savour
vs
session
i
still
think
i
prefer
the
maerzen
over
this
as
the
smokiness
is
not
quite
as
dominant
in
this
one
also
the
maerzen
seemed
to
have
a
stronger
hop
profile
than
this
though
i
last
had
it
ultrafresh
at
the
tavern
in
bamberg
so
my
opinion
may
be
skewed
there
obviously
unique
but
also
classy
in
its
advertisement
and
execution
this
is
the
beer
that
defines
its
style
much
like
urquell
and
guiness
no
other
explanation
is
needed
its
one
of
those
beers
to
me
thats
well
crafted
and
well
put
together
but
it
just
doesnt
completely
work
its
like
trying
to
make
smoked
cherries
good
beer
for
the
style
just
not
sure
this
style
is
good
d
this
is
a
very
interesting
beer
it
think
this
is
one
of
the
most
intense
smoked
beers
ive
had
the
bock
characteristics
are
missing
or
at
least
overshadowed
by
the
smoke
nice
to
sip
but
not
a
session
beer
comments
i
am
totally
blown
away
by
this
beer
totally
bold
over
the
top
and
it
doesnt
pull
its
punches
the
flavors
are
incredible
i
do
not
want
to
have
this
with
food
because
i
dont
want
to
disturb
the
flavors
heck
this
is
food
i
can
drink
this
all
day
and
night
the
beer
pours
a
deep
burgandy
color
with
a
thick
frothy
tan
head
that
slowly
fades
to
lacing
the
aroma
is
awesome
it
has
an
intense
smokey
aroma
that
is
complimented
with
crystal
and
roasted
malts
the
taste
is
awesome
as
well
it
has
a
smooth
creamy
flavor
that
boasts
of
crystal
chocolate
and
peated
malts
this
is
one
tastey
beer
it
goes
down
easy
and
finishes
slightly
sweet
with
that
dry
smokiness
the
mouthfeel
is
good
it
is
a
full
bodied
beer
with
adequate
carbonation
this
is
a
damn
fine
beer
i
love
the
aroma
and
the
taste
a
great
sessions
beer
pours
nicely
a
dark
garnet
highlighted
color
clear
with
a
fluffy
cloudlike
head
of
over
an
inch
nice
laces
fairly
thick
on
one
side
of
the
glass
whew
meaty
salty
aromas
slight
fruitwood
mouthfeel
is
airy
and
fluffy
light
with
restrained
carbonation
a
brief
sense
of
caramel
maltiness
and
a
bit
of
nuttiness
and
then
comes
the
overpowering
rich
fireplace
of
smoked
sensations
tangy
and
beefy
pickled
antelope
sausage
jerky
with
leather
and
oak
chips
scorched
earth
bitter
finish
just
welldone
i
really
like
the
monster
flavors
with
the
cotton
candy
lightbodied
mouthfeel
its
a
coolasfrigginhell
combination
that
floats
like
the
smoke
from
a
mid
summer
fire
pit
at
the
campground
these
schlenkeria
beers
are
hellaciously
smoked
beers
as
usual
with
rauchbiers
i
do
have
a
problem
drinking
more
than
one
drinkability
well
this
was
my
last
attempt
ever
i
think
at
a
rauchbier
i
wanted
to
go
out
in
good
fashion
by
trying
a
highly
rated
one
this
proves
that
rauchbiers
or
smoked
beers
are
not
my
cup
of
tea
i
wanted
to
give
it
good
makrs
because
you
are
supposed
to
rate
accoring
to
style
which
this
one
hits
dead
on
but
i
just
cant
if
you
like
smoked
beers
go
for
it
its
all
yours
an
aquired
taste
to
be
sure
cola
colored
when
poured
with
some
garnet
highlights
frothy
head
yields
some
pleasant
smoke
shed
aromas
i
enjoyed
the
full
chewy
mouthfeel
smooth
cool
malt
ends
in
tingly
smokiness
at
6
6
abv
this
is
one
to
not
go
bonkers
on
but
if
you
do
it
wasnt
so
hot
that
you
be
in
pain
later
the
style
is
one
that
grows
on
you
i
think
for
me
though
one
glass
or
half
is
enough
mid
sized
bottle
wo
freshness
dating
pours
a
deep
rich
shade
of
dark
honey
maple
tan
head
minimal
lacing
observed
from
my
sample
nose
is
clearly
and
boldly
the
expected
and
yearned
for
smoke
big
and
flavorful
brew
smokey
oily
greasy
ahhh
all
the
best
qualities
in
a
beer
im
sure
this
style
is
not
for
everybody
but
i
enjoyed
a
bottle
with
some
bbq
chicken
would
be
great
with
most
types
of
bbq
fare
fine
quality
brew
great
with
meats
and
hearty
foods
although
the
smoke
is
the
dominant
character
it
is
a
little
more
subdued
than
the
marzen
this
actually
falls
somewhere
between
the
marzen
and
weizen
this
beer
kicks
ass
the
germans
know
how
to
brew
a
mean
ass
rauchbier
pours
out
to
a
dark
amber
color
with
a
nice
dense
cloud
like
tancream
head
aroma
is
very
smokelike
as
can
be
expected
also
noted
were
elements
of
rich
roasted
malts
and
an
earthy
overtone
one
can
tell
that
this
is
a
serious
brew
for
the
true
beer
lover
flavor
is
badass
with
tones
of
smoke
herbs
and
a
slight
sweetness
nearly
perfectly
balanced
finished
with
an
almost
tangy
note
of
smoke
that
seemed
slighly
salty
a
truely
amazing
beer
very
drinkable
as
well
highly
recommended
having
this
beer
is
an
experience
not
simply
having
a
drink
and
it
definitely
is
not
for
everyone
as
for
me
well
i
think
its
a
very
nicely
crafted
brew
the
mouthfeel
is
medium
which
helps
make
this
a
good
food
beer
does
a
great
job
of
washing
down
the
smoked
salmon
and
cheeses
im
pairing
this
one
with
extraordinarily
unique
a
malty
thing
dominated
by
the
smoke
and
its
tenacious
associations
this
is
my
first
rauchbier
and
all
i
can
say
is
wow
this
is
one
interesting
beer
when
poured
it
appears
a
dark
murky
brown
very
much
like
a
dark
doppelbock
its
tan
head
quickly
dissipates
and
leaves
a
sticky
rim
that
leaves
a
lot
of
lace
on
my
glass
the
aroma
is
very
rich
and
malty
and
the
smoke
i
love
the
smoky
aroma
the
taste
is
smooth
an
malty
and
dominated
by
the
smoky
malt
when
i
say
smoky
i
mean
a
smokiness
that
is
almost
mind
blowing
i
am
in
love
with
this
brew
and
consider
it
a
must
to
have
around
continuing
to
exhale
as
i
sipped
provided
a
glimpse
of
hop
bitterness
before
i
became
overcome
again
by
smoke
as
this
delectable
urbock
fades
away
like
a
campfire
slowly
dying
out
in
the
wee
hours
of
the
morning
the
residual
taste
in
my
mouth
is
almonds
the
bbq
ones
i
swear
overall
i
say
this
one
is
extremely
drinkable
from
some
reviews
i
have
read
it
seemed
like
people
said
its
wither
good
or
bad
i
say
this
one
is
one
to
try
and
i
love
it
i
think
its
one
i
could
drink
all
day
long
1
pt
9
fl
oz
bottle
pours
out
a
clear
dark
amber
color
big
smoke
aroma
like
smoked
salmon
and
smoked
ham
the
first
time
i
had
this
beer
i
thought
the
smell
was
nasty
and
out
of
place
in
a
beer
but
i
have
come
to
enjoy
it
that
same
smoke
aroma
is
also
found
in
the
flavor
along
with
a
big
maltiness
these
flavors
complement
each
other
beautifully
no
hop
flavor
drinking
one
of
these
is
great
but
i
wouldnt
call
this
beer
drinkable
goes
well
with
grilled
meat
i
have
been
warming
to
the
smoked
beers
more
and
more
in
the
past
year
i
may
even
have
to
brew
one
myself
this
beer
poured
a
rubied
dark
brown
color
wtih
a
lack
of
head
the
nose
is
big
smoke
it
smells
like
jerkey
or
smoked
meat
to
me
very
intense
and
full
the
flavor
is
very
much
what
the
nose
gave
me
the
smoke
is
so
big
it
is
hard
to
get
the
nuances
of
the
beer
underneat
the
smoke
i
really
like
it
wow
the
feel
is
a
light
moderate
with
a
light
carbonation
i
really
like
the
big
smokyness
in
the
beer
i
have
now
had
this
beer
3
times
and
it
gets
better
each
and
every
time
dark
caramel
in
body
with
orange
hues
around
the
edges
head
was
nearly
white
and
settled
somewhat
quickly
a
couple
of
floaties
where
seen
doing
what
they
do
bestfloating
around
i
was
skeptical
about
the
ability
for
a
beer
to
really
smell
like
smoke
i
was
expecting
some
heavily
toasted
malt
flavor
but
low
and
behold
this
really
does
smell
like
smoke
there
is
quite
a
distinct
hickory
and
oak
wood
smoke
to
this
and
reminds
me
of
some
of
the
local
barbeque
pits
i
have
around
home
additionally
there
is
a
quite
recognizable
sweet
malt
aroma
which
is
highlighted
by
some
dark
fruit
essences
the
taste
is
quite
unique
and
immediately
biting
on
the
tongue
which
covers
up
some
of
the
initial
flavors
regardless
of
that
i
detect
essences
of
the
ripe
dark
fruit
which
was
in
the
aroma
and
only
some
subtle
flavors
of
backwoods
campfire
the
smoke
flavor
doesnt
come
through
in
the
main
body
of
this
beer
but
towards
the
finish
after
the
biting
sensation
has
all
but
passed
good
flavor
overall
but
i
was
expecting
a
bit
more
in
the
smoke
in
the
flavor
department
mouthfeel
is
very
heavy
and
it
definitely
feels
that
way
in
my
stomach
the
extremely
heavy
mouthfeel
brings
the
drinkability
down
a
bit
this
is
definitely
a
beer
to
try
due
to
its
uniqueness
in
the
right
mood
and
with
the
right
food
this
brew
is
awesome
i
will
buy
this
again
and
again
note
i
also
sampled
their
marzen
while
slightly
lighter
and
a
bit
less
sweet
overall
the
two
taste
so
similar
i
saw
no
reason
to
review
it
either
will
do
nicely
overall
a
drinkable
brew
but
i
think
i
would
have
to
set
my
limit
as
one
or
two
20oz
brews
in
a
sitting
has
a
smokey
barbecue
aroma
with
a
smooth
mouthfeel
i
tasted
almonds
and
subtle
hops
after
trying
the
weizen
first
i
was
thought
that
the
urbock
would
follow
suit
and
be
disappointing
well
i
wasnt
greatly
impressed
i
did
find
this
brew
to
be
much
smoother
and
less
aggressive
in
terms
of
that
smokey
flavor
this
would
go
well
with
a
burger
or
barbecue
this
is
one
great
looking
brew
clear
mahogany
with
rising
bubbles
and
a
head
that
appears
alive
both
big
and
small
bubbles
and
what
appears
to
be
a
layer
a
grease
on
the
head
smoked
pork
heavy
in
the
aroma
yum
the
taste
is
a
great
mix
here
there
is
sweet
caramel
maltiness
charcoal
smokiness
and
and
nice
dose
of
salty
bacon
fat
to
finish
things
off
very
big
on
taste
here
mouthfeel
is
good
but
the
carbonation
sometimes
gets
in
the
way
of
the
taste
im
longing
for
drinkablity
not
very
drinkable
to
be
honest
but
a
great
beer
nonetheless
i
wasnt
sure
what
to
expect
since
this
was
my
first
rauchbier
but
it
was
surely
a
pleasant
experience
there
will
certainly
be
a
return
trip
to
brauerei
hellertrums
products
flavor
is
light
on
the
smoke
which
is
just
right
smoke
beers
that
taste
like
cigarettes
and
burnt
meat
or
too
overdone
this
one
is
extremely
well
balanced
between
sweet
malts
dark
fruits
a
clove
spiciness
and
roasted
game
if
i
didnt
pour
this
myself
from
the
bottle
i
would
have
sworn
it
was
from
the
cask
great
smooth
mouthfeel
with
only
mild
carbonation
exceptionally
well
done
deep
mahogany
to
brown
color
white
foamy
head
disappears
fairly
quickly
to
a
thin
ring
aroma
seems
like
a
cross
between
campfire
and
beef
jerky
can
a
beer
really
smell
like
this
yes
sweet
malt
flavor
subtle
smokiness
very
little
hop
flavor
or
bitterness
this
beer
is
all
about
the
malt
and
the
sublte
smoke
based
on
the
aroma
you
would
think
the
smoke
would
dominate
but
this
is
not
the
case
medium
body
moderate
carbonation
drinkability
may
suffer
but
this
is
a
fantastic
beer
great
with
smoked
meats
and
cheeses
try
this
one
for
sure
overall
while
i
really
am
taken
with
this
style
it
remains
so
potently
smokey
that
i
can
only
take
in
one
and
not
all
that
often
so
the
drinkability
takes
a
minor
hit
still
brauerei
hellertrum
has
certainly
mastered
this
style
of
beer
and
has
a
devoted
fan
everyone
should
try
this
particular
beer
at
least
once
this
is
a
very
drinkable
beer
i
am
very
surprised
i
had
this
with
a
nice
meal
and
i
would
highly
recommend
this
beer
to
anyone
the
smoke
may
be
too
much
on
its
own
but
with
food
it
is
just
the
right
amount
the
bottle
disappeared
much
too
quickly
and
i
was
looking
for
another
that
i
did
not
buy
since
i
didnt
think
i
would
like
it
damn
live
and
learn
drinkability
and
overall
this
is
one
of
the
most
interesting
beers
ive
had
to
date
powerful
and
agressive
some
people
will
probably
be
turned
off
especially
those
of
a
weaker
palate
but
i
love
it
the
richest
tasting
brew
my
taste
buds
ever
came
across
so
overall
this
was
a
challenge
to
taste
and
a
weird
one
not
for
the
faint
of
heart
this
cannot
be
drunk
without
foodespecially
smoky
or
bbq
foods
it
will
not
be
for
everyone
it
does
have
a
flavor
that
sticks
with
you
and
makes
you
keep
taking
a
few
more
sips
i
guess
its
like
learning
to
like
blue
cheese
but
really
i
cant
imagine
finishing
whats
in
my
glass
much
less
having
more
than
one
i
cant
say
it
was
really
for
me
this
was
a
frustrating
beer
for
me
the
alltoobrief
sweet
malt
flavor
and
chewy
texture
made
me
want
more
but
the
incredibly
heavy
liquidpork
flavors
that
dominate
and
finish
the
beer
made
it
very
difficult
for
me
to
get
through
the
bottle
a
taste
im
not
sure
i
care
to
acquire
appearance
murky
mahogany
brown
with
a
nice
sized
tan
cream
head
leaves
fine
evenly
dispersed
lacing
not
bad
aroma
smoked
pork
you
choose
variety
sausage
bacon
etc
however
this
one
seems
to
be
much
more
complex
then
the
marzen
and
weizen
from
aecht
schlenkerla
a
huge
undertow
of
malt
here
the
bock
presence
along
with
alder
wood
smoking
process
equals
appetizing
taste
doesnt
destroy
or
ruin
your
palate
with
the
smoked
meat
varieties
it
opens
a
whole
new
realm
of
balanced
flavor
between
the
herbal
german
hops
and
bock
variety
malts
with
underlying
fruit
notes
masked
with
the
smokiness
just
tastes
incredible
smoked
meats
still
flow
along
your
palate
yet
its
not
overdone
within
the
urbock
but
definitely
a
beer
you
have
to
be
in
the
mood
for
mouthfeel
medium
body
smoked
malts
give
it
a
heavier
tone
carbonation
is
smooth
going
down
drinkability
pure
flavorfulness
of
the
malts
makes
this
a
slow
sipper
however
it
can
still
become
an
addicted
oddity
of
the
beer
world
the
heavily
smoked
malts
start
to
call
out
to
you
and
the
cravings
come
for
this
flavor
and
then
all
of
a
sudden
many
american
micro
versions
of
a
rauchbier
can
never
be
smokey
enough
thats
when
you
make
your
way
back
to
the
beer
store
to
hunt
down
some
aecht
schlenkerla
rauchbier
straight
outta
bamberg
drinkability

this
is
a
big
smokey
classic
german
rauchbier
with
tons
of
port
flavors
a
truly
big
exciting
interesting
very
tasty
beer
the
color
of
this
brew
is
a
deep
mahogany
creating
a
25
inch
mocha
colored
head
after
pouring
that
dissipates
from
the
center
of
the
glass
after
5
minutes
although
remains
around
the
edges
through
the
experience
the
nose
has
a
moderate
malty
smokiness
that
is
similar
to
a
tea
called
lapsang
souchong
a
tea
that
is
prepared
over
smoldering
pine
needles
this
particular
brews
malt
is
smoked
over
smoldering
beechwood
logs
to
impart
its
smoky
nose
and
flavor
the
smoky
flavor
is
pronounced
and
forward
much
more
so
than
the
nose
would
suggest
the
aftertaste
lasts
upwards
of
1
minute
the
structure
of
this
beer
is
akin
to
a
brown
ale
but
an
underlying
acidity
brightens
the
taste
and
allows
the
flavors
to
emerge
from
its
smoky
peaty
confines
the
mouth
feel
is
lacking
a
bit
of
weight
and
roundness
but
its
composition
does
allow
for
spirited
and
effortless
consumption
surprisingly
so
for
a
brew
that
has
such
profound
and
intense
flavors
i
would
robustly
recommend
this
brew
based
on
the
premise
of
its
pure
unadulterated
and
unusual
style
a
perfect
accompaniment
to
winter
stews
and
well
seasoned
meat
dishes
this
is
one
of
the
few
rauchbiers
smoke
beers
which
are
prepared
and
brewed
in
house
start
to
finish
a
superb
example
of
the
style
prosit
acquired
via
trade
the
last
smoked
beer
i
had
was
the
alaskan
smoked
porter
damn
that
was
a
good
beer
this
not
so
much
the
beer
is
a
nice
dark
brown
color
with
a
medium
beige
head
and
thin
lacing
the
aroma
is
equal
parts
ashtray
smoke
and
purina
beggin
strips
mediumbodied
with
a
very
smoky
character
as
a
matter
of
fact
it
dominates
everything
else
in
the
beer
the
finish
is
more
of
the
same
i
think
my
wifes
question
of
why
i
smelled
like
a
cigarette
i
dont
smoke
after
drinking
it
about
sums
it
up
its
just
too
much
bottle
bacon
salamy
mixed
in
with
grassy
herbal
flavours
the
bottle
i
had
may
have
been
a
bit
old
some
stale
flavours
came
though
may
have
been
a
bit
old
still
enough
flavour
to
keep
me
interested
i
think
i
still
prefer
the
weizen
and
marzen
versions
this
is
still
very
nice
though
beautiful
color
that
can
be
best
described
as
burnt
amber
the
body
was
clear
and
was
topped
with
a
foamy
tan
head
the
head
thinned
out
but
never
quite
died
the
aroma
is
that
of
an
intensely
smoky
grill
sprinkled
with
sugar
the
sweet
and
acrid
smell
hit
me
at
an
arms
length
and
nearly
put
me
into
a
higher
orbit
with
its
intensity
every
time
the
glass
touched
my
lips
the
taste
was
just
as
good
as
the
smell
with
a
caramelized
sweet
maltyness
and
a
smoky
bitterness
there
were
some
mildly
grassy
hop
presence
but
that
was
only
a
secondary
pleasure
the
mouthfeel
was
full
and
satisfying
and
the
smoky
aftertaste
lingered
on
forever
very
good
and
intricate
beer
that
is
the
best
of
the
rauchbier
offerings
in
my
opinion
the
mouthfeel
is
lighter
than
expected
and
clean
with
that
hint
of
smokiness
lingering
i
could
easily
have
gone
to
a
second
but
would
not
make
a
steady
diet
of
the
rauchbiers
this
was
a
wellbalanced
rauch
this
poured
out
a
very
dark
brown
with
a
reddish
hue
and
a
small
tan
head
that
was
the
result
of
an
aggressive
pour
the
small
head
quickly
falls
to
a
coating
of
bubbles
leaving
not
much
in
the
way
lace
holy
smokes
is
all
that
came
to
mind
when
i
first
poured
this
the
smell
of
the
smoke
quickly
filled
the
room
leaving
not
much
else
the
way
of
smell
besides
a
faint
trace
of
smoked
meat
i
believe
was
bacon
following
in
suit
was
thee
smokiness
that
dominated
the
flavor
i
started
to
detect
slightly
sweet
dark
fruity
malt
notes
as
well
as
a
bit
of
caramel
as
this
warmed
and
some
of
the
smoke
died
down
a
bit
of
a
smoky
aftertaste
lingers
around
after
each
sip
this
was
about
lighter
medium
bodied
and
hard
good
carbonation
and
a
smoky
coating
feel
to
it
pretty
drinkable
stuff
once
the
smoke
mellowed
out
definitely
a
beer
i
would
have
to
be
in
the
mood
for
overall
an
excellent
beer
that
delivers
on
the
rauchbier
experience
i
would
like
to
try
it
next
time
with
some
smoked
meat
as
the
scent
and
flavor
would
seen
to
go
perfectly
with
it
this
is
my
first
experience
with
smoke
beer
i
was
not
disappointed
this
stuff
poured
a
dark
brownish
red
colour
with
a
really
nice
25mm
or
so
head
that
stayed
for
a
while
the
smell
is
absolutely
awsome
not
an
unpleasant
smoke
smell
like
burning
leaves
or
something
but
a
meaty
smoke
smell
like
a
hickory
smoked
ham
or
ribs
or
something
very
delicious
smell
indeed
the
taste
wasnt
what
i
was
expected
as
i
have
heard
only
bad
about
this
stuff
i
thought
the
taste
was
fantastic
like
taking
a
sip
of
a
nice
oktoberfest
type
brew
while
having
a
mouthful
of
ham
and
bacon
who
wouldnt
like
that
very
impressed
will
buy
again
poured
a
deep
brown
with
ruby
highlight
lightly
cloudy
white
head
gives
up
without
much
fuss
the
smell
is
a
delectable
chocolate
and
smoke
almost
a
smoked
rib
meat
or
smoked
bacon
scent
the
taste
is
a
hint
of
chocolate
malt
a
bit
of
caramel
malt
then
a
lot
of
smoke
then
a
bit
of
hops
bitterness
then
a
bunch
more
smoke
oh
simply
heaven
the
mouthfeel
is
just
about
right
not
too
thin
not
too
thick
delightfully
in
the
middle
smoky
without
being
astringent
just
a
enough
sweetness
to
balance
it
all
out
a
fantastic
beer
and
the
inspiration
of
my
next
batch
of
homebrew
this
beer
poured
a
medium
brown
color
with
auburn
red
highlights
head
is
on
the
small
side
but
i
do
see
a
decent
amount
of
bubbles
rising
to
the
top
the
aroma
reminds
me
a
of
big
breakfast
with
sausage
eggs
bacon
and
toast
awesome
the
taste
has
less
of
a
smokiness
than
the
aroma
the
initial
flavor
is
of
a
nonsweet
malt
like
barley
but
there
is
a
sweetness
behind
the
initial
malt
base
akin
to
a
chocolatecaramel
mixture
i
notice
a
oak
like
flavor
in
the
base
of
this
beer
the
finish
is
more
smoky
and
it
lingers
the
balance
of
smokiness
to
sweetness
is
very
good
i
could
see
this
pairing
amazingly
with
any
smoked
meat
much
more
balanced
and
tastier
than
i
remember
the
marzen
being
a
very
good
beer
the
best
of
theirs
imho
smooth
medium
body
with
nice
light
carbonation
a
good
smoked
beer
but
nothing
ill
be
craving
anytime
soon
drinkability
is
a
very
high
very
obvious
smoke
flavor
which
i
truly
enjoyed
repeatedly
this
beer
is
absolutely
fabulous
with
bratwurst
or
other
smoky
meats
strong
flavored
foods
a
must
try
beer
dont
let
the
smoke
scare
you
this
is
a
dangerously
drinkable
brew
this
beer
is
truly
transcendental
this
brew
and
coheed
makes
me
wonderfully
happy
i
love
the
marzen
the
best
of
the
bunch
but
any
beer
from
schlenkerla
has
been
touched
by
god
seek
out
drink
up
and
be
merry
simply
amazing
drinkability
is
a
good
question
not
a
beer
i
would
want
to
drink
everyday
but
it
is
more
drinkable
than
you
would
think
i
have
many
good
ideas
for
cooking
with
this
rauchbier
poached
salmon
is
just
one
of
them
ruby
brown
generous
offwhite
head
receding
to
a
big
ring
aroma
is
heavily
smoky
youve
got
to
like
this
aspect
theres
just
tons
of
ham
bacon
pork
its
intensely
meaty
and
feels
like
a
meal
in
itself
very
expressive
and
one
that
you
can
smell
from
far
in
this
ragard
this
can
do
wonders
as
a
welcome
home
beer
or
a
barbecue
apetizer
it
remains
rather
sweet
too
with
its
maple
suggestions
peppery
and
salty
theres
even
leather
and
woody
flavours
in
there
this
is
pretty
complex
with
tons
of
character
the
oldest
sharp
smoked
cheddar
youll
come
across
body
is
mediumthick
fulfilling
with
a
bit
above
average
carbonation
mild
bitterness
in
the
finish
balances
from
the
rather
sweet
malts
fantastic
probably
the
smokiest
beer
on
the
planet
and
it
will
never
get
on
your
nerves
actually
i
wished
some
brewery
would
make
something
smokier
and
as
pleasant
than
this
but
this
is
an
old
mans
daydream
nevertheless
this
remains
the
father
of
smoked
beers
and
an
experience
to
enjoy
as
often
as
possible
a
truly
unique
product
of
great
appeal
the
flavor
too
is
well
smoky
but
considerably
less
so
than
the
aroma
and
mostly
toward
the
finish
at
the
start
after
youve
given
your
palate
a
few
sips
to
acclimate
the
malt
has
a
much
sweeter
character
as
it
warms
this
develops
notes
of
bitter
chocolate
the
smoke
really
kicks
in
at
the
finish
leaving
a
dry
almost
salty
feel
in
the
mouth
full
bodied
and
very
fullflavored
this
is
truly
a
beer
to
be
experienced
but
let
it
warm
a
while
and
give
yourself
time
to
enjoy
it
trust
me
youll
get
over
the
smoke
and
in
transcending
the
smoke
ye
shall
truly
come
to
love
it
overall
this
is
the
king
of
smoked
beer
and
with
good
reason
the
only
smoke
beer
ive
ever
had
that
was
better
was
the
peatsmoked
adelscott
from
fischer
i
love
smoke
beers
with
a
passion
and
you
should
too
not
an
everyday
beer
you
either
like
this
type
or
you
dont
sorry
especially
given
its
highly
unique
take
on
smoked
malts
a
perfect
example
of
a
wow
beer
a
must
try
with
food
mine
was
with
juicy
pork
fillets
and
a
little
maltier
than
the
marzen
a
little
bit
of
hops
on
the
finish
slow
sipping
smoked
brautwurst
beer
the
smoke
flavor
is
perfect
touches
of
barbque
or
mustard
sauces
but
a
bit
too
chewy
and
the
drinkability
is
good
as
well
this
is
a
good
beer
all
across
the
beer

combining
with

fairly
complex
this
seems
to
be
less
smoky
than
their
other
beers
from
what
i
recall
in

aroma

taste
is
exceptional
as
well
the
smoke
is
the
dominant
flavor
but
it
does
not
overpower
the
senses

the
smokiness
is
a
fairly

is

light

the

profile
mouthfeel
is
mediumlight
in

with
a
crisp
carbonation
and
a
touch
of
dryness
at
the
finish
overall
a
bit
more
subdued
than
the
marzen
and
drinks
easier
somewhat
akin
to
a
smokey
brown
ale
however
i
have
to
say
that
if
im
going
for
a
rauchbier
id
have
to
go
with
the
marzen
tap
poured

clear
light
maple

a
small
foamy

great

this
beer
continues
to
prove
how
good
schlenkerlas
smoke
beer
line
up
is
none
of
them
have
failed
me
and
this
is
possibly
their
best
probably
the
best
rauchbier
i
have
every
had
the
smoke
is
extremely
intense
and
over
the
top
but
yet
there
are
numerous
other
subtle
flavors
that
manage
to
come
through
im
extremely
fortunate
to
have
tasted
this
beer
and
i
really
hope
i
find
it
again
sometime
had
a
friend
pick
out
my
last
beer
of
the
night
at
maxs
and
was
presented
with
this
smells
like
a
straight
up
campfire
the
smokiness
in
the
aroma
was
as
pungent
as
ive
ever
smelt
in
a
beer
was
a
bit
worried
about
how
the
taste
would
be
but
man
was
i
blown
away
it
tastes
like
a
campfire
but
its
also
delicious
smoked
meat
and
bacon
flavors
come
through
and
its
flavorful
and
incredibly
well
balanced
goes
down
smoothly
with
a
great
finish
by
far
one
of
the
best
smoked
beers
ive
had
and
would
order
another
one
the
next
chance
i
get
worth
seeking
out
for
sure
o
a
really
nice
rauchbier
the
aroma
is
amazing
and
as
usual
schlenkerla
has
done
an
awesome
job
although
i
think
i
slightly
prefer
both
the
regular
urbock
and
marzen
thick
2
finger
head
with
excellent
retention
on
a
clear
deep
amber
body
aroma
is
like
a
meat
dominated
breakfast
with
ham
and
bacon
combined
with
mesquite
and
bbq
aromas
flavor
is
mild
which
is
good
for
the
style
with
a
very
smooth
toasted
malt
and
mesquite
flavor
finishing
smokey
with
bbq
notes
medium
body
and
lighter
side
of
moderate
carbonation
this
is
a
very
highly
drinkable
smoked
beer
with
an
excellent
chocolate
and
caramel
sweetness
definitely
the
most
drinkable
rauchbeir
and
one
of
the
best
tasting
of
the
style
i
have
had
very
well
balanced

wish
i
had
ordered
this
earlier
in
the
evening
to
enjoy
with
the
fff

m
unusually
clean
finish
on
the
medium
bodied
beer
clean
in
the
sense
that
it
is
unusually
stubby
in
length
for
a
rauchbier
usually
smoked
beers
linger
on
the
palate
for
much
longer
than
this
this
could
be
a
good
thing
or
a
bad
thing
depending
upon
your
personal
preferences

throughout
that
gracefully
fades
out
through
the
finish
on

at

bavarian

in

il
an
incredible
smoked
beer
available
for
a
very
short
time
during
lent
if
you
are
a
smoked
beer
fan
this
is
a
must
try
this
is
so
drinkable
that
even
if
you
are
just
thinking
of
trying
a
smoked
beer
this
is
the
one
to
try
you
will
be
hooked
as
this
version
is
a
gateway
smoked
beer
dont
fear
the
smoke
and
enjoy
lighter
body
soft
carbonation
the
base
of
this
beer
is
nice
but
when
the
smoke
comes
in
it
really
adds
another
dimension
fantastic
had
a
tulip
of
fastenbier
at
crescent
vine
in
astoria
honestly
its
pretty
similar
to
the
rest
of
schlenkerlas
rauchbiers
aside
from
the
dark
amber
color
its
also
a
crisper
and
a
touch
lighter
the
smoked
malts
are
cleaner
as
in
this
beer
doesnt
just
taste
like
bacon
it
has
a
dusty
flour
and
bready
malt
undertone
to
is
the
dark
malts
are
hard
to
pull
out
but
theres
a
slight
hit
of
smooth
caramel
malt
i
think
its
my
favorite
of
the
brewerys
many
smoked
beers
o
great
beer
you
wont
find
it
at
a
package
store
because
it
doesnt
come
bottled
so
if
you
happen
upon
it
at
a
bargrowler
store
you
should
take
advantage
of
it
i
am
not
sure
if
i
had
this
on
tap
or
cask
i
am
assuming
since
i
had
it
at
the
keller
it
was
on
cask
the
body
is
light
amber
brown
with
a
red
hue
it
had
a
creamy
head
with
good
follow
through
lace
the
aroma
is
a
deep
smoke
and
wood
scent
the
flavor
was
like
eating
meat
and
drinking
a
beer
it
the
same
time
with
some
subtle
hop
tones
it
was
light
bodied
and
went
down
easy
this
poured
out
as
a
reddish
looking
brown
color
with
a
very
thin
white
colored
head
on
top
the
head
settles
quickly
and
leaves
no
lacing
the
smell
of
the
beer
is
smoked
there
is
no
doubt
about
it
the
aroma
of
this
beer
though
it
not
quite
as
smokey
as
some
of
the
other
brews
from
this
brewery
the
taste
of
thee
beer
was
pretty
good
mostly
smokey
malts
with
a
light
saltiness
and
a
bit
of
toasted
flavors
in
there
too
the
mouthfeel
was
a
little
watery
i
thought
overall
this
brew
was
pretty
good
i
liked
it
as
it
was
but
cant
say
that
i
thought
it
was
the
best
out
of
all
of
them
pours
a
fairly
clear
burnt
orangered
with
a
nice
white
frothy
head
smells
smokey
and
light
some
nice
malty
sweetness
on
the
backbone
brown
sugar
notes
on
the
nose
smells
great
tastes
brown
sugary
and
sweet
the
smokiness
is
light
and
tasty
finishes
very
dry
overall
a
great
light
smoky
brew
that
is
distinctly
better
than
any
other
rauchbier
ive
had
pours
a
deep
amber
color
with
a
big
fluffy
white
head
the
aroma
is
smoky
with
some
charred
wood
smoked
meat
and
a
mild
maltiness
mostly
it
smells
of
sweet
aromatic
smoke
and
thats
just
fine
the
flavor
is
surprisingly
dry
and
bitter
while
maintaining
that
strong
smoky
character
i
hate
to
say
smoked
meat
again
as
this
does
not
actually
taste
like
meat
but
rather
a
bit
like
the
smoke
flavor
you
get
with
a
very
high
quality
smoked
meat
the
beer
has
a
nice
chocolate
note
to
it
as
well
and
this
is
perhaps
one
of
the
most
complex
of
the
schlenkerla
lineup
a
real
treat
i
cant
wait
till
it
comes
around
next
year
o
certainly
an
enjoyable
beer
that
would
go
great
with
some
bbq
think
of
this
as
schlenkerla
light
and
enjoy
it
for
what
it
is
man
im
i
happy
to
have
tried
this
one
one
of
the
best
rauchbiers
to
ever
touch
my
lips
i
do
enjoy
the
intense
baconysmoke
flavors
of
the
likes
of
urbock
and
marzen
but
this
beer
really
brings
all
that
intense
smokiness
down
a
level
making
it
incredibly
well
balanced
and
easily
the
most
drinkable
rauchbier
ive
ever
had
decent
but
didnt
like
this
as
much
as
their
other
offerings
amazing
beer
with
excellent
drinkability
o
really
good
this
is
probably
my
new
favorite
schlenkerla
draft
at
churchkey
dc
schlenkerla
just
isnt
going
to
disappoint
me
overallthis
is
a
wonderfully
balanced
rauchbeer
with
a
lot
of
complexity
on
tap
at
gourmet
haus
staudt
clear
mahogany
brown
with
a
lasting
offwhite
cap
smells
like
a
ham
sandwich
smoked
meat
saltiness
and
dark
crusty
bread
are
all
covered
theres
a
little
bit
of
sweetness
too
light
on
the
tongue
less
sweet
than
schlenkerlas
marzen
or
urbock
this
is
sort
of
like
a
session
rauchbier
unlike
their
helles
the
meaty
woody
smoke
character
doesnt
hold
any
punches
here
its
the
dominant
flavor
with
a
bready
toasted
malt
backbone
rounding
out
the
flavor
i
really
enjoyed
this
one
on
the
whole
possibly
my
favorite
from
this
brewery
behind
their
excellent
helles
flavorful
stuff
though
i
dont
see
how
remarkable
this
fastenbier
is
compared
to
the
rest
of
schlenkerlas
lineup
basically
like
a
slightly
stronger
version
of
the
rauchmärzen
pours
a
moderate
brown
color
with
some
copper
highlights
offwhite
head
forms
at
a
few
fingers
and
lingers
for
a
bit
before
falling
into
a
thin
cap
a
bit
of
lacing
the
nose
carries
a
light
amount
of
oak
as
well
as
what
is
reminiscent
of
oak
light
malt
with
a
bit
of
toast
smoke
is
not
overwhelming
smoke
hits
the
palate
really
well
in
the
flavornot
overpowering
but
definitely
the
dominant
character
light
woody
and
earthy
characteristics
and
a
bit
of
toasted
malt
the
mouthfeel
is
really
nicea
bit
of
smoke
as
well
as
an
almostcreamy
texture
really
really
well
done
one
of
the
best
smoked
beers
ive
come
across
poured
a
light
brown
color
with
a
twofinger
head
that
died
quickly
and
left
some
lace
mostly
a
meaty
smell
with
that
hint
of
pilslike
malt
and
grassiness
i
always
get
from
aecht
biers
this
one
isnt
as
smokymeaty
as
the
others
theyve
turned
down
the
smokecharrness
to
let
the
hops
peek
through
as
this
beer
is
light
smooth
and
theres
a
touch
of
sticky
sweetness
all
in
there
but
yes
mainly
a
smoky
beer
with
a
dry
finish
prickly
due
to
carbonation
this
beer
is
crisp
and
bitter
and
a
real
sipper
i
find
that
i
like
this
but
not
as
much
as
other
beers
from
this
brewery
overall
pretty
solid
glad
i
had
it
and
would
have
again
at
the
drop
of
a
hat
d
excellent
smooth
smoke
character
with
a
perfectly
balanced
malt
profile
obviously
smoked
beers
tend
to
be
something
that
most
people
either
love
or
hate
but
i
have
always
thought
that
a
few
bad
examples
have
given
the
whole
style
a
bad
name
this
beer
even
more
than
the
rest
of
the
schlenkerla
lineup
proves
that
theory
with
its
balanced
and
masterful
use
of
smoke
in
the
beers
flavor
profile
it
blends
so
well
with
the
malt
and
turns
a
pretty
standard
lager
into
something
truly
extraordinary
very
drinkable
this
is
something
that
any
open
minded
beer
drinker
could
enjoy
drinkability
awesome
and
great
for
pairing
with
foods
on
tap
at
kickbacks
gastropub
in
jax
poured
into
a
unibroue
tulip
mild
head
atop
a
rubyruddy
brown
body
lacing
is
sticky
and
almost
leaves
sand
like
bubbles
on
the
glass
then
leaves
a
creamy
swirl
in
the
body
of
the
liquid
aroma
is
certainly
smoky
and
toasted
campfire
and
beef
jerky
both
peppered
and
kippered
come
to
mind
taste
is
backed
by
a
bit
of
malt
sweetness
but
the
smoked
flavor
dominates
no
my
favorite
style
really
hard
to
review
a
beer
in
a
style
i
dont
love
but
i
cant
imagine
drinking
more
than
one
of
these
in
a
sitting
even
if
this
style
is
your
favorite
all
the
carbonation
seems
to
have
been
knocked
out
of
this
beer
during
its
service
from
the
tap
so
it
is
quite
smooth
feeling
but
it
still
has
some
viscous
heft
to
it
the
smoke
flavors
are
more
subtle
than
the
aroma
would
have
suggested
but
it
is
still
the
dominant
note
especially
in
the
finish
up
front
there
is
a
nice
sweet
maltiness
that
helps
to
balance
the
smoke
there
are
almost
some
berry
like
flavors
to
this
beer
perhaps
from
the
maillard
maltiness
that
is
not
really
caramel
but
definitely
rich
flavors
of
umami
and
peatsmoke
even
though
this
is
beechwood
smoked
malt
are
also
noticeable
here
this
is
definitely
a
beer
that
has
a
big
smoke
character
to
it
but
i
am
a
sucker
for
beers
like
this
so
it
definitely
hits
the
spot
i
dont
know
it
started
off
alright
but
was
a
little
work
trying
to
finish
not
the
best
aecht
has
to
offer
the
mouthfeel
was
crisp
and
on
the
thin
side
but
i
think
it
complimented
the
beer
well
and
enhanced
drinkability
as
with
other
smoke
beers
ive
had
if
they
are
too
dominating
and
full
bodied
the
pint
seems
to
be
a
challenge
about
halfway
through
this
beer
was
light
on
the
tougne
and
the
smoke
didnt
leave
a
harsh
aftertaste
my
first
smoke
beer
from
this
well
known
brewery
and
i
will
be
seeking
out
their
other
offerings
i
have
to
say
that
ive
come
around
on
these
rauchbiers
in
the
last
year
a
lot
its
been
a
rough
road
but
i
understand
them
now
and
semilook
forward
to
trying
additional
examples
pours
a
clear
dark
amber
color
14
inch
head
of
an
offwhite
color
good
retention
and
great
lacing
smells
of
smoke
slight
roasted
malt
yeast
and
hint
of
pale
malt
fits
the
style
of
a
rauchbier
mouth
feel
is
sharp
and
crisp
with
an
average
carbonation
level
tastes
of
smoke
yeast
sweet
malt
slight
pale
malt
and
a
hint
of
hop
wow
the
best
rauch
ive
ever
had
this
is
substantial
enough
to
drink
slowly
and
enjoy
and
the
flavor
is
remarkably
stable
as
it
warms
an
extraordinarily
nice
experience
this
smoked
lager
from
germany
poured
amber
brown
into
the
pint
glass
leaving
a
beige
thick
head
nose
of
smokey
goodness
just
an
exquisite
smokey
brew
not
bacon
smokey
but
oaky
smokey
easy
drinking
brew
the
smokieness
combines
well
with
the
lager
flavours
making
for
a
great
drink
the
low
alcohol
content
makes
the
beer
more
easy
to
drink
and
enjoy
somewhat
like
a
magical
cross
between
their
helles
nonsmoked
and
the
marzen
a
musttry
the
feel
is
nice
and
totally
easy
to
drink
d
though
this
is
a
highly
interesting
style
and
expression
of
a
rauchbier
it
is
not
something
that
i
would
want
to
partake
in
more
than
once
or
so
in
a
given
month
and
only
in
the
winter
months
at
that
if
you
like
rauchbier
i
think
this
might
be
a
very
good
one
d
its
really
easy
to
drink
this
beer
however
one
is
plenty
for
me
as
the
smokiness
while
done
expertly
and
mouthfeel
lower
the
rate
of
consumption
full
bodied
which
is
not
surprising
for
a
lent
beer
but
i
still
wasnt
expecting
the
mouthfeel
to
be
so
dense
nice
and
smokey
yet
still
well
balanced
by
other
flavors
making
it
extremely
complex
and
drinkable
slightly
nutty
with
lots
of
toasty
malt
and
bready
yeast
notes
contributing
to
the
full
body
with
a
surprisingly
strong
oak
presence
and
some
nice
crisp
hop
bitterness
the
hop
presence
was
much
more
prominent
that
i
had
expected
and
it
was
a
very
pleasant
surprise
although
these
other
flavors
are
present
this
beer
is
still
dominated
by
smoked
malt
lots
of
smokey
campfire
flavor
with
hints
of
bacon
barbecue
charcoal
and
burnt
toast
as
in
the
nose
there
are
a
lot
of
different
elements
contributing
to
the
complexity
of
this
beer
in
one
sip
you
get
smoke
oak
nut
caramel
and
bitter
dry
hops
all
complimenting
each
other
without
anything
becoming
to
overpowering
even
the
smokiness
incredibly
quaffable
and
absolutely
delicious
highly
recommended
on
a
curve
due
to
its
powerful
taste
this
was
very
drinkable
i
am
happy
to
have
gotten
to
try
this
d
tasty
goes
down
ok
not
too
filling
mild
kick
good
representation
of
style
the
smokiness
was
a
little
too
strong
for
me
but
its
a
good
beer
overall
on
tap
at
bullfrog
brewery
the
guest
tap
this
smoked
lagerhelles
had
a
yellow
bodyw
hisp
of
white
head
and
some
lace
lines
bit
of
smoke
light
mouthfeel
smoked
flavour
was
decent
minerally
balanced
with
a
bit
of
malt
for
drinkability
hits
the
mark
notes
the
final
beer
listed
here
on
ba
from
this
brewery
all
of
them
are
excellent
drinkability
is
phenomenal
for
what
it
is
this
is
one
of
the
first
true
rauchbiers
ive
had
a
whole
serving
of
and
drinking
this
one
is
much
much
easier
than
i
expected
so
much
balance
for
such
an
intense
smokebomb
overall
outstanding
this
was
the
definition
of
the
smoked
beer
i
was
looking
for
super
drinkable
and
a
near
perfect
example
of
the
style
medium
brown
with
small
head
fantastic
rauchbier
aroma
of
sweet
smoked
meat
and
bacon
the
thrid
i
have
had
from
this
brewery
adn
i
have
never
been
disappointed
the
flavor
is
full
on
smokiness
but
surprisingly
light
by
memory
i
cant
detect
a
lot
of
differemce
from
their
marzen
as
with
other
rauchbiers
from
this
brewery
amazingly
drinkable
i
dont
get
tired
of
this
intense
wonderful
smoky
flavor
more
this
is
one
tasty
rauchbier
and
it
never
gets
old
bye
bye
growler
i
was
really
glad
to
have
had
the
opportunity
to
try
this
remarkably
flavorful
and
rare
lenten
beer
although
no
one
aspect
really
stood
out
as
being
remarkable
the
beer
was
quite
interesting
nevertheless
this
would
pair
perfectly
with
some
german
smoked
sausages
overall
a
delicious
and
highly
drinkable
smokey
delight
that
said
its
probably
hard
to
drink
more
than
one
big
seidel
of
this
unless
youre
really
thirsty
andor
have
a
bunch
of
wellmatched
food
to
eat
along
with
it
the
smokiness
and
robustness
of
flavor
actually
does
not
provide
for
infinite
drinkability
the
final
word
this
is
kinda
like
a
cross
between
the
aecht
helles
and
urbock
i
never
find
schlenkerla
beers
to
be
super
quaffable
the
flavor
is
so
bold
to
start
with
that
i
take
small
sips
and
before
i
know
it
ive
had
about
a
tenth
of
the
glass
after
10
minutes
does
start
to
go
down
easier
after
getting
used
to
the
flavor
really
could
use
a
meal
with
this
all
in
all
no
regrets
in
trying
this
but
i
wouldnt
lose
sleep
over
missing
it
fans
of
the
brewery
wont
be
disappointed
enjoyed
a
glass
on
tap
at
track
84
in
ri
nice
roasty
brown
with
a
creamcolored
headlacing
aroma
is
pure
rauchbier
campfire
bacon
charcoal
this
is
one
of
those
beers
that
tastes
exactly
as
it
smells
like
drinking
a
liquid
campfire
but
somehow
it
works
having
this
alongside
a
stone
smoked
porter
really
highlights
the
strong
flavors
this
smoky
beast
makes
the
stone
taste
like
a
run
of
the
mill
porter
not
sure
that
i
would
have
more
than
one
but
the
experience
was
well
worth
it
truly
a
unique
beer
from
the
barrel
in
their
taproom
brown
almost
black
color
with
a
persistent
off
white
head
a
bit
of
smoke
and
roasted
malt
in
the
aroma
though
it
was
difficult
to
tell
in
the
bar
initially
sweet
taste
like
a
milk
stout
some
roasted
malt
flavor
and
bread
flavors
the
smoked
malt
beef
jerky
flavor
is
strong
in
the
finish
and
became
increasingly
noticeable
as
the
beer
warmed
very
filling
mouthfeel
as
it
warmed
the
smoked
malt
flavor
became
a
bit
overwhelming
and
the
thickness
of
the
beer
became
quite
filling
still
having
this
beer
on
tap
at
its
home
was
an
amazing
experience
d
definitely
the
most
drinkable
of
the
rauchsmoke
beers
ive
tried
the
slightly
lower
abv
than
the
regular
aecht
offerings
and
the
mild
aftertaste
and
residual
feel
make
this
surprisingly
sessionable
wish
this
was
a
yearround
offering
and
not
only
for
lent
worth
seeking
out
especially
for
lovers
of
the
style
a
pleasingly
mouthcoating
thickness
is
cut
by
the
carbonation
so
that
the
overall
feel
is
of
medium
body
smooth
to
drink
which
i
appreciated
in
a
rauchbier
i
was
really
caught
off
guard
by
just
how
drinkable
this
was
sipping
and
tasting
while
taking
notes
and
before
i
knew
it
it
was
half
gone
the
pour
was
somewhere
in
the
vicinity
of
22
oz
and
i
would
gladly
have
had
another
if
there
werent
other
beers
to
try
if
i
ever
again
find
myself
in
an
establishment
with
this
available
i
wont
think
twice
about
ordering
it
drinkability
this
is
my
second
favorite
offering
from
the
brewery
and
well
worth
a
try
the
smoke
is
not
overpowering
and
the
flavor
is
incredible
while
i
will
not
drive
the
hour
to
taste
this
again
this
year
i
will
happily
order
this
again
come
next
lent
on
tap
tonight
at
deep
ellum
served
in
a
0
5l
mug
dark
brown
color
huge
white
head
the
smell
was
like
sticking
your
nose
in
a
campfire
smoke
very
nice
outdoorsy
smell
taste
was
a
bit
more
subdued
but
the
smoke
flavor
was
there
body
was
light
enough
to
allow
one
to
drink
this
in
larger
quantities
not
overpowering
so
this
beer
remained
drinkable
even
in
a
larger
serving
like
the
one
i
received
if
you
like
rauchbiers
you
can
go
wrong
with
the
gold
standard
that
is
aecht
schlenkerla
as
a
cigar
smoker
i
found
this
brew
very
refreshing
tappity
tap
at
maxs
in
bmo
marzeny
amberbock
with
a
nice
aroma
of
smoky
malts
and
a
bit
of
the
ole
german
hops
in
the
background
taste
is
smoky
and
the
smokerauch
notes
mix
well
with
the
big
bolshy
bread
malts
and
the
faint
spicy
floral
hops
in
the
background
mouthfeel
is
medium
bodied
and
drinkability
is
good
for
this
smoky
treat
one
of
the
best
from
hellertrum
i
wish
we
saw
this
one
out
in
sf
more
often
ive
only
seen
it
at
toronado
once
or
twice
and
maybe
that
german
place
in
hayes
valley
once
or
twice
as
well
d
outstanding
plenty
of
smoked
character
but
with
a
kind
of
balance
that
makes
this
one
endlessly
drinkable
pours
dark
brown
with
mahogany
tints
with
very
little
head
and
a
little
lacing
wowzers
this
one
smells
like
smoked
sausage
up
front
with
the
roasted
malts
in
the
background
the
taste
follows
the
aroma
with
a
huge
smoked
bacon
and
sausage
flavor
but
the
sweet
malt
base
comes
through
a
little
more
in
the
taste
and
balance
the
brew
very
well
the
body
is
medium
with
the
smoky
malt
lingering
on
the
palate
for
ages
ive
only
had
a
few
rauchbiers
but
this
one
is
the
best
by
a
mile
highly
recommended
i
was
lucky
enough
to
find
this
on
tap
at
ashleys
in
ann
arbor
i
got
a
pint
and
slowly
immersed
myself
in
the
smoky
goodness
that
is
this
beer
it
was
dark
reddish
copper
colored
mostly
clear
with
a
thick
offwhite
foam
the
aroma
is
nearly
intoxicating
in
smokiness
possibly
the
most
appetizing
rauchbier
presence
ive
yet
smelled
the
taste
was
sublime
sweet
and
malty
with
a
perfect
smoky
wood
flavor
i
think
this
is
my
favorite
rauchbier
out
of
the
maybe
8
ive
tried
if
you
see
this
give
it
a
chance
its
a
treat
a
perfect
pour
for
this
style
great
head
that
leaves
excellent
lacing
throughout
the
session
and
sticks
around
slightly
hazy
chestnut
in
color
balanced
malt
and
smoke
aromas
this
doesnt
seem
like
ham
in
a
glass
but
much
more
subtle
and
interesting
than
that
there
is
quite
abit
of
bitterness
in
the
mix
as
well
that
adds
to
the
intrigue
the
bitterness
especially
makes
this
far
from
one
dimensional
the
taste
is
similar
with
a
great
herbal
bitterness
that
nicely
balances
the
smoke
very
complex
with
all
sorts
of
things
changing
moment
by
moment
bitter
sweet
smokey
herbal
woody
mouthfeel
is
a
bit
woody
and
tannic
which
also
plays
well
with
the
smoke
and
cuts
through
the
big
flavors
extremely
enjoyable
i
must
have
had
six
of
these
over
the
week
it
was
on
very
special
dont
make
a
final
judgement
about
rauchbier
until
you
try
this
one
d
it
was
a
well
blended
brew
that
was
unique
and
well
worth
sampling
the
light
body
and
low
abv
make
it
very
drinkable
but
the
bite
of
spices
and
bold
smoky
flavor
make
it
a
beer
i
could
enjoy
occasionally
but
not
in
a
session
dthis
is
a
rauchbier
for
true
smoke
lovers
really
fantastic
with
no
holds
barred
d
wow
this
beer
is
something
else
and
it
really
is
quite
unique
my
gf
and
i
both
enjoyed
a
bit
and
id
certainly
do
another
sometime
if
it
were
available
d
a
blend
of
delicious
smokiness
and
low
abv
make
for
a
very
drinkable
experience
an
excellent
beer
surprized
to
find
this
on
tap
at
fiddlers
hearth
in
south
bend
theyve
had
some
excellent
stuff
lately
though
poured
into
a
glass
with
the
brewerys
name
on
it
looked
good
tawny
brown
short
tan
head
disappeared
after
a
minute
or
two
smelled
smokey
and
clean
hint
of
hops
taste
starts
out
a
little
smokey
with
solid
malts
and
an
unidentifiable
bitterness
hops
and
smoke
flavors
become
more
pronounced
as
i
drink
resting
on
a
firm
but
light
malt
backbone
finish
is
like
a
good
cigar
with
leafy
spicy
hops
and
a
ghostly
smoke
presence
extremely
satisfying
and
very
tasty
id
have
had
a
few
more
but
it
was
lunchtime
i
can
def
imagine
drinking
this
with
a
smoked
ham
or
smoked
gouda
simply
awesome
brew
that
has
to
be
enjoyed
slowly
its
my
first
rauchbier
but
it
was
fantastic
is
it
possible
that
it
tasted
even
better
than
it
smelled
this
is
what
i
wrote
down
last
night
before
i
put
my
notebook
away
awesome
heavy
malts
balanced
by
big
smoke
and
slight
hop
bitterness
dry
finish
spectacular

the
one
thing
that
surprises
me
a
little
bit
is
that
this
is
apparantly
a
rauchbier
based
on
a
dopplebock
recipe
as
for
the
dopplebock
part
id
expect
more
thick
maltiness
in
the
flavor
more
heft
in
the
body
and
a
higher
alcohol
percent
but
in
any
case
this
is
a
damn
good
rauchbier
very
interesting
beer
to
drink
though
i
can
see
where
it
might
not
be
for
everyone
while
i
quite
liked
it
i
cant
see
myself
putting
down
more
then
one
or
two
of
these
at
a
sitting
smokey
feel
persists
but
remains
mellow
in
the
mouth
long
lasting
malt
has
a
marzen
feel
to
it
not
sure
what
style
fastenbier
is
supposed
to
be
a
lenten
fasting
beer
it
would
suit
me
if
were
ever
inclined
towards
selfdiscipline
i
thought
a
bock
which
they
already
do
would
cover
that
category
for
those
who
arent
so
severe
in
their
austerity
this
was
a
nice
drinkable
smoked
ale
balanced
with
a
good
level
of
carbonation
this
is
second
only
to
the
helles
for
sessionability
this
rauchbier
poured
a
hazy
amber
color
with
creamy
tall
fluffy
offwhite
foam
that
clung
to
the
glass
a
bit
the
smell
was
a
very
nice
smoke
aroma
with
good
moderate
maltiness
the
taste
was
mildly
smokey
smoked
meat
with
sweetish
malt
beneath
the
smoke
and
mild
hoppiness
throughout
the
mouthfeel
was
smooth
and
creamy
with
medium
body
and
moderate
carbonation
the
smoke
and
malt
lingered
pleasantly
on
the
palate
this
was
a
very
nice
beer
not
overly
smoked
somewhat
less
smokey
than
other
schlenkerla
rauchbiers
and
more
reminiscent
of
spezials
rauchbier
it
was
just
as
good
from
a
growler
a
day
or
two
later
the
memory
of
this
beer
makes
me
long
for
lent
on
tap
10
ounce
sample
at
maduros
in
madison
wi
served
in
an
aecht
schlenkerla
glass
this
beer
has
a
hazy
brown
color
topped
with
a
small
head
as
the
beer
was
set
in
front
of
me
i
immediately
smelled
smoked
malt
fruit
and
a
hoppy
aroma
that
i
didnt
expect
from
this
beer
the
hoppiness
worked
quite
well
however
the
flavor
is
a
meaty
smokiness
with
caramel
fruit
and
hops
malty
but
not
too
sweet
the
fruitiness
and
hoppiness
made
this
beer
quite
different
from
the
other
beers
made
by
this
brewery
mouthfeel
is
not
too
heavy
drinkability
is
superb
my
glass
was
finished
much
too
quickly
this
is
mighty
tasty
stuff
one
of
the
most
incredible
tasting
beers
ive
tasted
served
in
a
25
cl
aecht
fastenbier
glass
looks
like
a
mini
imperial
pint
glass
on
tap
at
maduro
in
madison
wi
medium
dirty
orange
brown
body
hazy
with
frothy
head
the
color
of
aged
white
wallpaper
in
a
smokers
home
sweet
smoky
aroma
with
a
subtle
bitter
hoppness
very
mellow
and
light
bodied
and
yet
it
tasted
like
a
mesquite
grilled
steak
really
after
one
gets
past
the
initial
blast
of
prairie
fire
smoke
this
beer
tastes
just
like
a
nice
hunk
of
beef
finishes
with
a
nice
caramel
sweetness
very
easy
to
drink
overall
im
not
really
sure
if
this
is
my
thing
i
dont
know
a
lot
about
rauchbiers
but
this
one
seems
pretty
damn
great
for
the
style
to
me
its
less
intimidating
then
some
of
the
others
out
there
smoke
wise
but
the
chewy
meatiness
is
just
great
what
a
unique
mouthfeel
i
honestly
dont
understand
what
the
big
deal
about
this
beer
is
basically
its
a
mellower
session
version
of
the
big
3
dont
get
me
wrong
killer
beer
i
could
drink
it
all
day
but
compared
to
the
other
rauchbiers
from
the
same
brewery
its
mediocre
sort
of
the
aecht
shlenkerla
baby
rauch
poured
in
a
big
wine
glass
it
had
a
strong
aroma
of
sweet
smoke
not
bitter
smoke
or
woody
smoke
but
sweet
one
of
the
best
smelling
beers
i
have
ever
encountered
the
head
was
moderate
and
somewhat
grayish
in
color
the
beer
fairly
dark
in
the
glass
a
milder
taste
than
other
rauchbiers
ive
had
sweeter
hoppier
gentler
but
still
undeniably
smoky
and
strong
another
poster
mentioned
being
reminded
of
toasting
marshmallows
by
the
fire
and
that
is
the
perfect
way
of
describing
the
blend
of
flavors
very
drinkable
and
not
too
strong
it
would
have
been
easy
to
down
the
whole
glass
but
it
was
worth
a
slow
drink
wonderfully
drinkable
an
unbelievable
smoked
session
beer
that
could
replace
any
food
and
leave
you
satisfied
although
it
goes
great
with
smoked
ham
and
radishes
i
was
deeply
dissapointed
when
the
growler
was
finished
guess
ill
have
to
wait
until
next
year
or
brew
my
own
many
thanks
to
the
dilly
deli
for
procuring
one
of
only
2
kegs
brought
into
ohio
this
was
a
rare
treat
that
really
exceeded
my
expectations
this
was
a
fantastic
beer
first
rauchbier
looking
forward
to
trying
more
they
totally
nailed
all
the
flavors
with
this
beer
pours
a
clear
dark
brown
with
a
creamy
twofinger
head
that
dissipates
to
a
thin
ring
leaving
lots
of
lacing
in
its
passing
the
smell
is
of
smoked
ham
and
treacle
roasted
malt
and
caramel
the
flavor
reflects
the
aromas
in
perfect
harmony
moderate
carbonation
and
silken
mouth
feel
round
out
this
classic
marzen
based
rauchsbier
a
very
enjoyable

o
not
my
cup
of
tea
but
an
extraordinarily
well
executed
beer
which
hits
exactly
the
notes
it
promises
surprisingly
restrained
all
told
strikes
me
as
having
interesting
potential
for
use
with
a
cheese
plate
or
accompanying
bbq
from
the
can
brewed
according
to
the
bavarian
purity
law
dark
brown
clear
beer
with
a
heavy
smoky
aroma
its
taste
is
malty
with
a
light
hoppy
bitterness
the
smoke
dominates
the
aroma
light
brown
and
long
lasting
head
light
bitter
flavor
with
a
long
smoky
finish
texture
and
mouthful
is
ok
and
not
too
watery
what
can
i
say
i
have
enjoyed
this
in
the
summer
winter
and
fall
smokey
and
enjoyable
i
recommend
at
least
three
half
liter
servings
before
condeming
the
nasty
smokiness
overall
this
could
be
a
marmite
beer
you
either
love
it
or
hate
it
me
i
love
it
i
like
smoky
things
and
whilst
i
have
beers
with
smoky
elements
to
the
flavour
profile
think
stouts
and
so
forth
none
are
as
complete
as
this
its
very
much
malt
and
smoke
driven
so
theres
nothing
much
for
the
hopheads
but
even
so
its
different
enough
to
be
worth
a
try
for
anyone
was
better
than
i
expected
some
sweetness
in
with
the
smoke
just
not
my
favorite
style
tastes
and
smells
like
barbeque
char
chocolate
malt
flavor
comes
through
as
well
good
stuff
outstanding
beer
with
very
good
smell
and
taste
o
again
wild
its
got
some
of
that
peaty
scotch
ale
thing
happening
and
the
smoke
is
everpresent
but
theres
nothing
over
the
top
here
either
the
malt
offers
just
enough
sweetness
to
keep
it
from
tasting
like
a
burnt
oak
log
a
different
experience
but
one
worth
having

a

the
flavor
isnt
as
intense
and
i
am
appreciative
the
peat
campfire
and
smoky
bacon
give
way
to
some
slight
malt
and
general
beer
flavor
the
body
feels
fuller
because
of
the
scent
and
flavor
intensity
not
much
of
a
rauchbier
lover
this
one
falls
right
in
line
with
the
rest
of
them
for
me
hey
at
least
this
brewery
go
full
bore
and
christens
you
with
smokey
meat
and
peat
dont
love
it
but
i
suppose
i
respect
it

finally
settles
down

just
along
the

of
the

after
a
good
30
minutes
some
spotty
sticky

is
seen
when
sipped
the
aroma
is
of
smoked
roasted

for
the
most
part
the
taste
is
pretty
much
the
same
with
a
very
light
hint
of
caramel
malts
in
the
mix
also
the
smoke
is
not
over
done
though
but
it
is
there
really
no
bitter
or
harsh
aftertaste
to
speak
of
mediumbodied
with
perfect
carbonation
overall
it
was
different
but
ok
overall
another
great
beer
from
schlenkerla
but
not
as
good
as
the
urbock
in
my
experience
i
really
enjoy
the
more
pure
campfire
smoke
in
the
urbock
than
the
meaty
smoke
in
this
one
may
be
my
favorite
beer
overall
surprising
since
the
first
time
i
drank
it
at
the
brewery
i
found
it
actually
kind
of
gross
the
smoke
is
delicious
but
not
overwhelming
it
has
a
nice
smooth
almost
creamy
feel
with
a
medium
body
this
is
great
paired
with
german
fare
preferably
something
pork
with
strong
fllavors
priceless
experience
if
you
can
enjoy
a
liter
of
it
at
its
source
delicious
the
smoke
is
well
balanced
with
the
sweetness
and
hops
i
was
hestitant
to
try
this
after
other
mediocre
smoked
beers
back
to
back
with
beaus
rauchstack
i
like
smoked
food
but
i
cant
handle
this
didnt
care
for
the
aroma
of
smoked
meats
o
a
great
place
to
start
for
anyone
wanting
to
taste
a
mildly
smoky
beer
while
this
is
good
i
prefer
its
stronger
cousin
the
rauchbier
urbock
o
i
have
a
very
hard
time
with
smoked
beers
rauchbiers
usually
because
the
smoke
component
is
way
too
strong
and
in
your
face
however
this
actually
is
very
balanced
and
you
can
still
tell
there
was
a
base
beer
in
there
somewhere
with
the
caramel
sweetness
of
the
marzen
an
excellent
version
of
rauchbier
this
was
my
first
rauchbier
and
i
was
very
impressed
i
loved
the
smokey
nature
of
it
and
the
depth
of
its
flavor
like
drinking
a
bonfire
smoked
malts
used
to
make
this
beer
take
out
all
chocolate
and
malty
flavor
great
mouth
feel
and
very
unique
flavor
this
poured
a
nice
clear
dark
liquid
with
a
dime
sized
tan
head
the
nose
is
smoke
bbq
ribs
smoke
with
a
hint
of
malt
the
taste
is
surprisingly
less
smoky
with
an
earthy
quality
to
it
there
is
a
bit
of
sweetness
that
comes
through
as
you
let
the
beer
linger
the
carbonation
also
lingers
a
bit
on
back
of
the
tongue
helping
to
balance
the
beverage
out
i
was
expecting
a
little
more
smoke
but
am
i
happily
surprised
with
how
balanced
and
tasty
it
is
they
werent
kidding
when
they
classify
this
as
a
smoked
beer
drank
straight
from
the
bottle
reminded
me
of
smoke
kielbasa
around
a
campfire
pleasant
beer
to
drink
very
crisp
and
easy
to
drink
beer
delicious
smokey

seriously
had

i

its

actually
quite
drinkable

highly
enjoyable
drink
this
one
with
some
smoked

while
sitting
around

a
really
well

that
harnesses
the

instead
of
letting
it
go

do
not
fear
the

overall
really

i
wouldnt

i
truly
enjoyed

i
picked
up

beautiful

great

and
a
tradition
that
i
hope
stays
for
good
the
definition
of
craftartisanal
beer
overall
for
sure
one
of
the
most
unique
beers
i
have
ever
tasted
not
a
huge
fan
of
the
style
but
from
reading
the
description
it
really
seems
to
nails
it
i
think
the
rating
are
all
over
the
place
for
this
beer
because
the
style
is
pretty
different
and
maybe
not
the
most
palatable
for
everyone
i
could
see
this
being
a
very
good
cheese
paring
beer
though
poured
from
a
16
9
oz
bottle
into
a
belgian
tulip
glass
o
oh
god
what
an
excellent
beer
one
of
the
more
full
and
complex
lagers
out
there
glad
to
see
that
a
few
of
the
bamberg
breweries
are
still
cranking
out
traditional
smoked
beers
and
doing
a
worldclass
job
of
it
this
is
worldbeating
stuff
an
absolute
musttry
for
any
serious
beer
aficionado
overall
i
think
i
prefer
the
urbock
but
this
is
tasty
overall
a
well
executed
rauchbier
with
a
smoke
profile
followed
by
a
supporting
roasted
malt
backbone
would
definitely
recommend
to
give
this
one
a
go
if
you
are
a
fan
of
the
style
o
very
interesting
smoke
aromas
and
flavors
in
this
beer
without
being
overwhelming
very
enjoyable
especially
for
someone
that
enjoys
smoke
and
pretty
easy
to
drink

well

smoked
sausages

smoked

an
interesting
beer
the
quality
seems
fine
but
it
may
take
a
few
of
these
to
develop
my
palate
for
them
my
first
one
was
not
that
enjoyable
and
i
have
tried
most
styles
asr
poured
an
attractive
chestnut
brown
colour
with
a
large
slightly
offwhite
head
that
lasted
for
several
minutes
before
fading
to
a
18
cap
of
foam
leaving
some
modest
lacing
and
spotting
down
the
glass
its
aroma
was
strong
and
made
up
of
wood
smoke
and
back
bacon
the
beers
flavour
was
distinct
but
somewhat
more
subtle
than
its
aroma
beginning
continuing
and
ending
with
wood
smoke
with
a
mild
bitterness
noticeable
at
the
finish
both
the
smokiness
and
slight
bitterness
continued
as
a
long
lasting
aftertaste
i
found
the
carbonation
to
be
quite
moderate
but
well
suited
to
the
beer
and
would
describe
asr
as
medium
bodied
though
i
was
a
bit
nervous
at
the
start
due
to
past
experience
with
a
couple
of
overpowering
smoky
beers
this
was
a
refreshing
change
of
pace
not
a
style
that
i
would
drink
every
week
but
a
bit
of
a
flashback
to
a
bygone
age
when
all
malt
for
brewing
in
germany
was
dried
over
a
wood
fire
and
quite
reasonably
priced
at
3
15
per
bottle
o
my
first
experience
with
the
rauchbier
style
though
not
my
first
smoked
beer
that
being
said
i
have
had
better
smoked
beers
but
overall
this
was
an
enjoyable
drink
more
of
a
winter
or
early
spring
beer
than
any
other
time
i
would
think
pours
a
nice
dark
brownish
red
with
a
decent
head
that
dissipated
fairly
quickly
smells
smokey
of
course
and
the
taste
is
a
bit
smokey
but
not
nearly
as
strong
it
smells
was
a
fairly
easy
beer
for
me
too
drink
its
got
a
lot
going
on
but
not
so
much
that
it
feels
too
complex
was
a
simple
beer
imo
i
enjoyed
it
very
much
but
it
does
take
a
little
getting
used
to
overall
very
good
but
not
something
i
will
drink
often
prefer
to
share
this
pint
with
a
friend
in
the
winter
months
quite
literally
the
best
beer
ive
ever
tasted
smooth
but
very
very
full
and
rich
taste
without
being
overwhelming
the
smokey
tones
really
make
this
beer
unique
for
those
of
us
that
like
dark
and
complex
beers
this
is
an
absolutely
wonderful
experience
o
pretty
tasty
overall
ill
definitely
be
having
this
and
the
urbock
sometime
in
the
future
overall
i
thought
this
was
a
pretty
good
beer
and
a
pretty
good
example
of
the
style
i
havent
gotten
that
smoked
meat
flavor
in
many
smoked
beersand
i
thought
that
it
worked
well
with
the
campfire
smoke
aspect
and
it
helped
the
smoke
not
wear
on
the
palate
this
beer
had
pretty
good
drinkability
it
was
smooth
clean
fairly
crisp
not
filling
and
the
taste
did
a
nice
job
at
holding
my
attention
i
thought
the
smoke
would
start
to
wear
on
me
but
it
doesnt
and
i
think
i
could
drink
a
couple
pints
of
this
but
that
may
be
my
limit
for
some
reason
i
think
this
would
be
a
nice
fall
time
beer
maybe
because
of
the
smokey
aspect
what
i
liked
the
most
about
this
beer
was
the
balance
in
the
taste
the
smoke
really
showed
up
but
it
wasnt
too
overpowering
and
it
let
some
of
the
nice
marzen
flavors
come
through
what
i
liked
the
least
about
this
beer
was
nothing
there
isnt
anything
that
i
can
of
think
that
would
improve
this
beer
its
good
just
the
way
it
is
i
would
buy
this
beer
again
when
im
in
the
mood
for
the
style
and
i
would
recommend
it
to
anyone
who
likes
smoked
beers
i
like
the
style
but
in
my
experience
some
of
them
wear
on
me
quickly
with
the
harsher
smoke
flavor
but
this
beer
kept
all
aspects
pretty
balanced
and
it
was
more
drinkable
than
i
thought
it
would
this
beer
made
a
good
first
impression
for
aecht
schlenkerla
ill
be
looking
for
more
of
their
beer
and
so
far
this
is
my
favorite
traditional
german
rauchbier
nice
job
guys
this
is
one
tasty
and
drinkable
rauchbier
keep
up
the
good
work
overall
this
brew
is
overhyped
in
my
opinion
its
a
work
of
art
but
the
scent
just
destroys
it
it
smells
like
piss
im
sorry
but
it
does
im
going
to
try
and
finish
it
though
well
see
where
my
opinion
takes
me
towards
the
end
of
it
overall
pretty
good
beer
that
is
a
very
good
example
of
the
style
aecht
schlenkerla
is
definitely
where
it
is
at
for
rauchbiers
definitely
worth
a
try
even
if
you
dont
like
smoky
beers
this
is
sweet
and
fruity
enough
that
it
might
just
change
your
mind
the
rauchbier
had
toasty
campfire
tobacco
tastes
and
surprisingly
mediumbody
smoothness
and
it
deliciously
complemented
the
smoky
fish
chowder
and
salty
crackers
i
ate
for
dinner
i
didnt
even
want
to
have
a
6th
sip
let
alone
eat
something
this
is
the
best
german
brew
ever
in
my
humble
opinion
pours
the
color
of
brown
sugar
you
immediately
smell
the
smoky
aroma
delicious
mouthful
is
substantial
but
not
too
full
the
taste
is
smoky
brown
sugar
like
a
perfectly
cured
ham
this
is
my
favorite
german
import
cannot
get
enough
it
is
perfection
overall
sexy
bacon
beer
fo
real
try
it
this
is
one
of
my
favorite
beers
being
the
premier
example
of
a
rauch
beer
easy
drinking
almost
a
session
beer
taste
smoked
meat
was
unable
to
adequately
decipher
all
of
the
complex
flavors
but
the
smoked
meat
is
what
stands
out
initially
not
too
heavy
a
beer
each
sip
i
could
only
describe
as
intriguing
there
is
more
than
a
smokey
meat
flavor
and
smell
but
it
will
take
further
investigation
for
this
beginners
palate
to
unravel
the
intricacies
of
this
beer
given
its
history
it
is
at
very
least
a
must
try
for
any
beer
lover
it
is
easy
to
see
how
one
of
these
could
be
enough
for
a
beer
drinker
but
it
is
equally
easy
to
see
how
one
could
become
slave
to
the
uniqueness
of
this
style
of
beer
i
for
one
have
no
choice
but
to
delve
deeper
into
the
mysteriousness
of
the
flavors
and
smells
of
these
beers
o
granted
this
is
my
first
rauchbier
but
this
beer
is
great
great
change
up
from
the
normal
and
the
smoked
pork
flavor
is
phenomenal
the
work
of
masters
this
beer
is
a
beer
opera
of
deep
emotional
taste
aecht
schlenkerla
rauchbiers
märzen
has
the
kind
of
complex
flavor
profile
to
which
even
days
of
repeated
sipping
and
notetaking
couldnt
do
justice
the
addition
of
roasted
malts
makes
this
beer
darker
than
most
märzens
but
their
presence
is
perhaps
what
makes
this
beer
so
outstanding
ill
be
sure
to
pick
up
another
bottle
next
year
ges
gesch
rauchgeschmack
full
disclosure
i
mentioned
i
bought
this
among
a
few
other
marzens
around
oktoberfest
but
this
one
was
still
around
only
because
it
just
looked
like
something
i
wouldnt
really
like
so
its
safe
to
say
i
was
very
pleasantly
surprised
by
the
aroma
and
flavor
would
go
great
with
any
smoky
gouda
sausage
or
grilled
meat
overall
ive
known
people
who
felt
the
smoke
in
this
brew
was
overwhelming
but
to
me
its
nearly
perfectly
balanced
everything
works
amazingly
well
the
smoke
attack
quickly
calms
down
and
the
fruit
profile
slowly
begins
to
dominate
although
always
leaving
a
healthy
amount
of
room
for
the
smoke
i
havent
had
many
rauchbiers
but
i
keep
coming
back
to
this
one
great
stuff
overall
4
0
definitely
not
for
the
unadventurous
this
beer
is
unusual
and
highly
rewarding
smooth
refined
and
certainly
not
something
that
was
brewed
as
a
one
off
or
an
experiment
this
brew
is
expertly
balanced
and
just
fantastic
it
matches
perfectly
with
certain
foods
the
slight
bleu
cheese
taste
led
me
to
try
it
with
bleu
cheese
and
i
was
very
impressed
with
the
results
if
you
find
it
and
are
on
the
fence
invest
the
paltry
amount
of
money
and
try
this
brew
out
on
tap
at
millwrights
tavern
in
simsbury
ct
amber
color
but
two
tone
colored
a

settles

and
leaves
sheets
of

up
the
sides

the
glass
malty
and

aroma
rich
flavor

biscuit
malt
laced
with
peat
smoked
malt
good
balance
rich
and
malty
with
a
nice
even
smokiness
rich
and
full
mouthfeel
been
wanting
to
try
this
one
for
a
while
and
pleasantly
surprised
to
see
it
on
tap
right
in
my
home
town
very
good
beer
othis
is
a
really
tasty
example
of
the
style
the
smoke
is
strong
but
it
never
overpowers
things
and
provides
a
nice
complex
flavor
the
flavors
are
balanced
and
smooth
even
though
the
feel
is
a
little
soft
and
heavy
drinkability
is
high
as
well
o
an
amazing
beer
like
a
fine
bordeaux
rather
than
a
big
brooding
shiraz
or
zin
so
much
taste
and
complexity
without
being
aggressive
a
recalibration
of
my
tastebuds
look
this
is
the
my
first
of
the
style
and
if
this
beer
is
supposedly
as
good
as
others
say
it
is
it
will
be
my
last
it
pours
a
nice
color
with
a
medium
head
and
very
good
lacing
the
smell
is
all
smokeso
much
so
that
i
can
barely
taste
the
bacon
and
meat
that
others
rave
about
but
then
again
if
i
wanted
to
smell
meat
i
would
buy
meat
the
taste
in
my
maybe
naïve
and
unsophisticatedopinion
is
drowned
out
by
smokiness
some
reviewers
have
congratulated
this
beer
for
its
complexity
and
for
the
smoke
flavor
for
being
nuanced
but
what
i
find
is
smokiness
that
has
gotten
out
of
control
i
love
a
beer
with
some
character
and
theres
nothing
more
attractive
than
a
beer
that
compliments
both
a
campfire
and
a
steak
at
the
same
time
but
this
just
seems
to
go
too
far
and
in
the
process
loses
the
complexity
that
some
are
convinced
that
it
has
o
amazing
beer
my
first
rauchbier
and
i
absolutely
loved
the
style
one
of
the
few
really
great
beers
ive
had
in
a
long
time
recommend
to
try
o
a
truly
unique
beer
yet
it
manages
to
be
more
than
just
a
great
aroma
the
sweeter
aspects
of
the
beer
are
completely
unexpected
after
the
intense
smoky
nose
and
ham
and
bacon
hints
and
this
makes
the
beer
all
the
more
impressive
easily
could
become
a
regular
beer
for
me
smoke
dominant
but
with
enough
malty
sweetness
to
counter
very
intriguing
flavor
profile
would
go
great
with
bbq
this
is
a
perfectly
balanced
flavorful
beer
that
makes
no
apologies
for
being
the
cream
of
the
crop
i
cant
imagine
anything
making
it
better
except
for
possibly
getting
it
fresh
at
the
source
which
would
be
something
worth
striving
for
a
smoked
marzen
beer
is
always
an
interesting
choice
i
had
to
try
this
one
this
pours
a
medium
brown
color
with
a
thin
head
the
aroma
has
that
classic
smoked
grain
smell
which
always
reminds
me
of
bacon
the
texture
is
smooth
due
to
low
carbonation
very
unusual
flavor
not
quite
sure
what
to
make
of
this
one
other
than
interesting
o
not
as
bacon
tasting
as
other
rauchbiers
ive
had
pretty
good
but
not
something
id
have
without
food
overall
a
very
tasty
beer
the
smoke
flavor
is
just
enough
not
overpowering
a
very
tasty
brew
although
an
occasional
one
for
me
this
beer
still
impresses
me
rich
meaty
smokiness
that
to
me
palate
never
gets
overwhelming
the
only
thing
i
could
hope
for
would
be
a
bit
more
bitterness
on
the
finish
but
otherwise
this
is
a
standout
waves
of
flavour
and
still
really
good
drinkability
probably
not
for
everyone
im
a
fan
of
smoked
things
in
general
but
the
offerings
by
schlenkerla
take
it
to
a
new
level

smells
like

with

the
taste
is

the
aroma

some
burnt

earthy

but
with
a
good
sized
amount
of

times
light
but
creamy

this
is
a
style
i
love
but
cant
find
a
whole

of
overall
solid
rauchbier
ill
be
buying
again

toffee

it
will
be
great
of
course
with
a
smoked
salmon
of
some
other
smoked
fish
but
great
too
with
sausages
not
for
everyones
palate
maybe
even
for
mine
but
a
good
beer
indeed
i
was
somewhat
apprehensive
about
the
smoke
in
this
as
i
am
fairly
new
to
the
whole
rauchbier
thing
but
those
fears
were
allayed
as
the
masters
from
bamberg
crafted
a
ride
that
welcomes
you
with
subtlety
and
nuance
instead
of
bashing
your
face
in
the
background
of
a
stellar
märzen
a
style
im
not
usually
that
big
on
combined
with
a
gently
dominant
smoke
makes
this
a
very
good
beer
and
an
excellent
introduction
to
the
style
i
suppose
theyre
the
benchmark
for
a
reason
i
dont
think
making
a
better
rauchbier
is
possible
the
smokiness
in
this
beer
is
amazing
and
i
would
love
to
pair
this
with
some
smoked
meats
o
im
having
a
pepperoni
bacon
and
jalapeno
pizza
with
this
beer
and
the
combination
is
great
maybe
a
little
one
dimensional
to
have
on
its
own
but
the
lingering
smoke
flavor
melds
great
with
the
savory
spicy
pizza
edit
had
to
revise
this
yet
again
as
i
revisited
and
the
taste
and
mouthfeel
are
great
of
the
style
just
a
get
beer
that
is
balanced
smoke
heavy
but
never
overwhelming
this
is
one
of
my
first
forays
into
rauchbiers
and
i
have
to
say
i
enjoyed
it
i
would
not
drink
this
all
of
the
time
but
i
appreciate
just
how
different
it
is
compared
to
some
traditional
styles
i
am
glad
that
for
my
first
try
i
got
one
of
the
best
examples
of
the
style
i
cant
say
that
i
would
have
it
again
and
i
cant
even
finish
the
bottle
its
strong
but
not
harsh
did
not
score
a
t
s
m
at
that
time
disregard
those
scores
i
seriously
need
to
grill
some
sausage
to
go
with
this
beer
o
this
is
the
best
smoke
beer
i
have
ever
had
it
defines
the
style
for
a
reason
most
smoke
beers
i
drink
are
way
too
heavy
handed
this
is
subtle
balanced
and
delicious
cheers
overall
quite
a
tasty
rachbier
with
a
huge
smoky
nose
but
yet
rather
palatable
and
pleasing
blend
of
flavors
beyond
just
smoke
i
love
this
flavorful
and
legendary
beer
how
can
you
possibly
make
a
brew
that
tastes
like
bacon
and
still
is
refreshing
and
very
pleasant
to
drink

no

overall
drinkability
this
is
a
good
beer
but
is
not
as
good
as
schlenkerla
eiche
i
do
love
the
overall

effect
this
has
which
is
definitely
a

of
big
bacon
and
smoked
pork
mixed
with
notes
of
smoked
hickory
on
the
tongue
the
beer
tastes
of
savory
smoky
malt
faint
bitters
from
the
roasted
malt
and
slight
sweet
malt
flavors
begin
with
smoky
malts
that
move
quickly
into
bacon
and
smoked
salmon
with
a
touch
of
smoky
wood
as
it
warms
some
slight
dark
fruit
notes
can
be
detected
in
the
malts
the
finish
moves
into
notes
of
canned
cat
food
mixed
with
more
notes
of
big
bacon
the
aftertaste
is
light
salty
bacon
on
the
tongue
in
the
mouth
the
beer
feels
medium
to
heavy
in
body
with
a
smooth
carbonation
the
slips
over
the
tongue
leaving
the
mouth
a
little
thick
with
a
dry
bacon
feel
with
some
slight
saliva
running
from
the
tongue
from
acidity
overall
i
like
this
beer
it
is
a
classic
rauchbier
and
fills
all
the
requirements
of
the
style
it
does
leave
a
slight
cat
food
flavor
in
the
mouth
which
is
a
little
odd
as
i
notice
it
more
and
more
but
it
is
still
tasty
and
displays
the
smoked
malts
well
very
focused
on
the
smoke
obviously
but
lets
the
other
flavors
play
out
the
aroma
is
much
stronger
in
smoke
than
the
flavor
the
aroma
has
more
of
a
bbq
smell
while
the
taste
has
more
of
a
smoked
grass
flavor
awesome
if
you
like
smoked
beers
taste
is
the
same
smokey
sweet
malts
so
nice
its
smoked
flavor
is
so
smooth
and
balanced
glad
i
revised
this
its
awesome
my
palate
has
definitely
changed
over
the
years
because
i
really
enjoyed
this
beer
httpwww
youtube
comwatchvyyfgaryke4qfeaturesharelistpl2bgeaoaxbdbwvixnvfklbcod4yfdcw9m
overall
i
have
to
say
that
im
seriously
relieved
i
think
this
is
a
beer
that
pairs
better
with
some
pretty
strong
foods
bbqed
meat
especially
i
tried
this
with
a
tandoori
chicken
pizza
and
it
was
great
i
would
actually
try
this
smoke
beer
again
which
is
a
first
for
me
because
all
the
other
smoke
beers
ive
had
were
way
too
smokey
drinkin
this
with
my
corn
dog
amanda
dark
brown
in
color
with
ruby
edge
and
a
faint
white
head
aroma
is
pork
smoke
char
light
malt
flavor
is
same
as
nose
with
fruity
yeast
esters
nice
hop
balance
very
well
balanced
crispy
carbo
light
bodied
very
deelish
when
i
first
started
trying
new
beers
i
picked
this
one
up
not
knowing
what
it
was
i
saw
a
guy
walk
in
to
the
liquor
store
make
a
beeline
to
this
beer
grab
4
and
leave
i
presumed
it
was
good
and
bought
one
as
well
when
i
got
around
to
trying
it
i
hated
it
i
have
definitely
matured
my
palate
because
this
is
an
excellent
beer
especially
for
what
it
is
i
believe
i
liked
the
urbock
a
little
bit
more
although
id
really
have
to
try
them
back
to
back
just
to
be
sure
and
i
think
i
might
do
that
soon
i
remember
loving
the
thick
and
creamy
body
of
the
urbock
and
the
flavors
popped
a
bit
more
this
one
might
have
a
better
nose
though
either
way
both
are
quintessential
examples
of
the
rauchbier
style
the
nose
was
quite
impressive
and
a
bit
intimidating
but
it
did
not
translate
to
the
taste
though
that
is
not
to
say
that
taste
was
a
let
down
as
it
was
still
enjoyable
and
combined
with
the
mouthfeel
made
it
easy
to
drink
as
strong
as
the
smokey
bbq
scents
are
the
taste
is
relatively
tepid
smokiness
pervades
but
the
meaty
flavors
are
not
there
a
bit
of
wateriness
strikes
the
tongue
at
an
in
opportune
time
and
smothers
the
finish
i
do
like
the
taste
and
it
finishes
easy
and
refreshing
but
i
had
hoped
the
taste
would
emulate
the
scent
and
it
did
not
rjt
notes
actually
was
surprised
at
how
accessible
the
beer
is
i
could
easily
see
myself
putting
down
a
second
in
the
same
sitting
the
smoky
profile
is
not
palate
fatiguing
in
the
least
great
food
beer
and
a
must
try
style
imo
it
pours
a
dark
clear
red
with
a
tan
head
the
head
recedes
to
leave
a
thin
layer
of
foam
that
leaves
excellent
lacing
the
aroma
is
distinctivly
smokey
but
the
malt
peaks
through
at
times
the
taste
is
not
nearly
as
intense
as
the
aroma
malt
and
dark
chocolate
eventually
fade
to
reveal
a
sweet
delicate
smoke
flavor
the
mouthfeel
is
wonderful
it
is
surprisingly
light
bodied
leaving
a
crisp
and
clean
feeling
with
low
carbonation
very
strange
but
very
good
the
hopness
is
wellbalanced
with
the
slim
body
and
the
aftertaste
is
lingering
very
pleasing
fantastic
beer
different
from
everything
i
ever
had
before
drink
it
fresh
a
true
smoky
beer
experience
as
billed
baconsausage
and
meaty
favors
come
to
mind
a
mild
slight
caramel
as
well
the
amber
black
hue
imparts
a
final
touch
of
campfire
goodness
i
really
enjoy
this
style
and
want
to
revisit
the
offerings
from
schlenkerla
ran
into
a
fellow
beer
geek
when
he
recommended
this
wonderful
beer
to
me
popped
off
the
cap
and
the
smokey
aroma
that
reminds
me
of
pork
or
smoked
bacon
deep
amber
hue
with
a
fluffy
head
and
lacing
around
the
glass
overall
i
really
like
this
beer
the
smoked
flavours
really
make
it
great
highly
suggest
this
another
excellent
rauchbier
from
aecht
schlenkerla
has
a
really
nice
balance
between
the
marzens
sweet
maltiness
and
smoke
this
is
freakin
tasty
oh
yes
this
is
a
beer
no
telling
how
many
of
these
i
had
in
my
couple
days
in
bamberg
a
neat
shapeshifter
of
a
beer
this
one
is
the
initial
aromatics
are
so
pungent
that
i
could
see
lesser
mortals
turning
away
at
this
point
however
if
one
persists
a
more
agreeably
smoky
malty
offering
emerges
one
that
is
actually
rather
drinkable
and
even
enjoyable
also
a
bit
of
an
appropriate
metaphor
for
tonights
supposed
end
of
the
world
theatrics
o
not
a
beer
to
be
taken
lightly
definitely
pair
with
a
strong
flavored
food
amazing
late
night
beer
with
asskicking
but
well
balanced
smoke
flavor
o
i
loved
this
but
then
again
i
really
like
this
style
definitely
the
best
rauchbier
i
have
ever
had
the
american
attempts
dont
hold
a
candle
to
this
german
beast
im
looking
at
you
sam
adams
this
is
the
real
deal
omaybe
the
best
rauchbier
ive
had
it
just
has
the
perfect
amount
of
smoke
to
it
a
lot
of
rauchbiers
ive
had
were
more
like
novelty
beers
you
try
them
when
you
want
to
impress
your
friends
with
something
unique
but
not
this
beer
this
is
a
good
beer
to
sip
or
quaff
by
the
fire
on
a
nice
relaxing
night
the
flavors
are
complex
but
mellow
the
smoke
is
there
not
as
a
punch
in
the
face
but
as
a
nice
reminder
of
all
those
good
times
youve
had
by
a
nice
fire
o
this
is
the
iconic
german
example
of
a
style
that
few
make
and
even
fewer
do
well
when
in
the
mood
i
would
absolutely
get
another
of
this
and
the
price
and
availability
make
that
very
likely
o
i
have
to
admit
i
just
review
3
belgians
through
out
the
day
and
though
i
was
craving
any
thing
but
a
belgian
i
dont
think
it
affected
this
review
all
and
all
it
was
a
great
beer
my
only
complaint
was
that
it
was
more
like
a
brown
then
a
marzen
i
tasted
no
sweet
malts
as
i
would
expect
from
a
marzenocktoberfest
i
was
very
nutty
which
taste
wise
complemented
the
smokiness
style
wise
forced
me
to
lower
the
score
one
this
awesome
brew
an
amazing
beer
not
a
good
beer
at
all
this
one
had
such
a
strange
and
unusual
taste
that
it
wasnt
enjoyable
at
all
it
was
a
hard
one
to
get
your
head
round
as
it
basically
tasted
like
a
ham
or
broth
and
nothing
like
a
beer
for
the
most
part
there
was
a
smoky
flavour
in
there
but
it
wasnt
a
beer
that
i
liked
at
all
o
this
might
be
my
favorite
marzen
to
ever
touch
my
glass
even
though
this
is
a
rauchbier
this
really
puts
a
damper
on
all
marzens
to
touch
my
lips
this
is
a
hearty
fallwinter
beer
to
keep
you
warm
even
though
the
abv
is
low
my
only
regret
was
not
drinking
this
with
my
bbq
beef
ribs
last
night
poor
timing
but
great
beer
the
best
brew
out
of
my
advent
calender
so
far
far
not
sure
if
it
was
worth
the
100
but
id
pay
a
few
bucks
to
drink
another
one
of
these
o
medium
body
and
carbonation
a
favourite
for
me
because
it
is
drinkable
and
unique
poured
into
a
glass
mug
pours
fairly
clear
dark
caramel
brown
with
an
offwhite
head
i
can
see
plenty
of
bubbles
in
the
beer
and
along
the
side
of
the
glass
the
head
retreats
slowly
this
beer
definitely
smells
smokey
and
earthy
on
the
nose
the
smokiness
in
the
nose
is
not
overpowering
in
the
flavor
i
pick
up
some
of
those
sweet
malts
its
a
little
earthy
the
body
is
light
to
medium
with
moderate
carbonation
the
finish
is
fairly
clean
and
the
drinkability
is
high
this
is
an
excellent
beer
taste
is
definitely
woodysmoky
with
a
tinge
of
sweet
malts
underneath
just
enough
around
the
edges
to
add
some
balance
this
is
a
tasty
drinkable
and
positively
a
unique
experience
that
any
serious
beer
advocate
needs
to
try
the
only
other
schlenkerla
beer
ive
had
is
the
urbock
and
as
expected
this
one
is
incredibly
similar
first
sip
is
smokey
but
not
as
overpowering
as
the
aroma
is
it
plays
the
leading
role
but
the
sweetness
of
the
malts
plays
a
nice
secondary
role
hints
of
brown
sugar
and
caramel
before
the
inevitableness
that
is
the
schlenkerla
savory
smoked
meat
finish
the
biggest
difference
between
märzen
and
urbock
would
be
in
the
body
with
the
lighter
alcohol
of
the
märzen
being
noticeable
in
the
mouthfeel
this
brew
poured
a
really
dark
brown
with
a
one
finger
white
head
the
carbonation
on
the
brew
was
moderate
the
nose
was
exactly
what
i
wanted
from
a
rauchbierlots
of
smoke
and
bacon
and
there
is
absolutely
nothing
wrong
with
smoke
and
bacon
this
was
a
really
pungent
nose
but
one
i
enjoyed
the
taste
again
is
filled
with
smoke
and
bacon
there
was
also
a
hint
of
malt
in
this
brew
the
one
thing
that
really
shocked
me
on
the
beer
was
how
thin
it
was
and
how
mild
the
carbonation
was
a
beer
with
big
flavors
likes
this
should
really
be
a
little
thicker
in
my
opinion
but
thats
my
only
complaint
this
was
also
a
nice
session
brew
that
was
really
drinkable
and
unique
i
would
definitely
have
this
again
but
its
not
for
the
faint
of
heart
overall
i
am
pleased
with
the
beer
its
great
for
food
pairing
and
its
a
great
introduction
to
smoke
beers
o
fabulous
especially
compared
to
what
rauchbiers
ive
had
so
far
smoke
is
strong
but
nicely
compliments
other
malt
flavors
in
the
beer
most
smoked
beers
i
can
barely
have
one
of
but
i
could
drink
a
few
of
these
fabulous
o
pleasantly
surprised
but
ze
germans
do
all
of
their
beer
right
a
joy
to
drink
this
style
may
not
be
for
everybody
but
its
most
likely
one
of
the
best
offerings
o
nice
bamberg
style
brew
nevertheless
of
the
few
that
i
have
tried
this
one
is
by
far
the
best
that
thick
smoky
flavor
gives
way
to
some
sweet
malts
and
caramel
the
marzen
aspect
of
the
beer
definitely
comes
through
a
little
but
its
smothered
in
smoked
ham
might
go
well
with
some
sharp
cheddar
or
bbq
but
putting
down
500ml
of
this
alone
proves
to
be
a
bit
more
difficult
overall
though
the
friend
im
with
doesnt
like
this
beer
since
his
palate
cannot
wrap
itself
around
this
bold
style
i
really
like
it
i
will
admit
that
ive
only
tried
sam
adams
version
but
as
a
beer
on
itself
it
holds
up
very
well
o
if
i
didnt
follow
the
suggestions
of
herrburgess
and
drink
this
as
my
first
beer
of
the
night
i
likely
would
have
gone
lol
bacon
sux
i
no
liek
this
beer
and
given
it
something
along
the
lines
of
a
2
55
overall
luckily
i
took
his
word
seriously
and
the
beers
i
had
before
helped
smooth
this
out
brilliantly
its
one
of
those
beers
that
works
better
the
more
you
drink
it
allowing
me
to
see
it
for
the
incredible
beer
that
it
is
o
my
first
venture
into
rauchbiers
was
truly
unforgettable
what
an
outstanding
beer
im
not
sure
how
wide
the
interpretations
of
this
style
go
but
anything
that
can
beat
this
in
complexity
aroma
and
drinkability
would
be
nothing
short
of
superb
overall
a
great
german
beer
of
which
there
are
plenty
but
this
one
still
manages
to
stand
out
from
the
crowd
overall
lots
of
smoke
but
its
a
bit
thin
with
some
off
notes
overall
a
delicious
treat
well
worth
the
high
cost
best
rauchbier
ever
my
girlfriend
and
i
pick
up
a
bottle
every
month
or
two

0
this
beer
is
surprisingly
drinkable
but
it
almost
feels
like
a
gimmick
beer
were
one
to
forget
history
it
suffers
from
being
this
unique
and
not
having
many
beers
at
least
commercially
accessible
to
compare
and
establish
a
referential
so
the
fear
of
underestimating
this
beer
is
present
nonetheless
its
something
everyone
should
try
i
would
recommend
this
brew
to
a
friend
high
b
overall
this
beer
is
a
classic
for
a
reason
on
its
own
its
a
fun
beer
to
drink
and
as
a
beer
drinker
it
is
really
in
the
top
20
beers
you
really
have
to
try
but
itd
be
really
great
skillfully
paired
with
food
or
use
in
preparing
bbq
not
with
bbq
but
like
in
a
preparation
for
some
reason
i
want
panseared
scallops
paired
with
this
to
give
an
overall
smokiness
to
the
dish
or
something
like
that
where
the
beer
could
add
that
smoke
flavour
to
the
food
its
really
versatile
and
if
you
havent
had
it
you
really
ought
to
definitely
worth
seeking
out
to
have
at
least
once
o
a
good
beer
overall
im
not
too
familiar
with
the
style
but
the
super
smokey
aspects
are
tasty
o
clean
and
somehow
simple
beer
despite
its
peculiar
character
has
more
to
it
than
the
not
so
complex
flavour
suggests
in
terms
of
balance
drinkability
pure
smoked
feel
briefly
not
super
tasty
but
definitely
perfect
o
of
all
the
smoked
beers
that
ive
had
this
one
is
definitely
the
most
pure
and
clean
tasting
it
reminds
me
of
winters
at
home
the
smell
is
reminiscent
of
hickory
smoked
bacon
and
has
a
hint
of
almonds
dark
clear
amber
color
and
absolutely
perfect
cream
colored
head
low
carbonation
and
balance
make
this
one
an
easy
drinker
d
as
a
marzen
its
amazing
as
a
rauchbier
its
smoked
out
amazing
ive
been
wanting
to
try
this
one
for
some
time
but
honestly
didnt
expect
it
to
be
this
good
the
smoke
isnt
so
overbearing
and
without
the
smoke
it
would
be
one
of
the
best
marzens
in
my
shiny
brown
marzen
book
metaphor
the
smoke
almost
takes
over
the
10
foot
radius
around
the
opened
beer
it
really
hit
me
when
i
popped
the
cap
its
a
full
hickory
almost
oaky
smoke
like
bbq
type
smoke
the
taste
is
dominated
by
the
smoke
very
oaky
and
dominated
by
the
wood
its
the
tale
of
an
unbalanced
rauchbier
all
in
all
another
smoke
beer
to
fall
in
love
with
though
this
one
may
be
for
those
with
a
more
delicate
taste

sweet
malt
aroma
smoky
with
a
light
bitter
malt
start
somewhat
dry
light
malt
middle
and
smoky
with
a
hint
of
hop
finish
light
to
medium
bodied
sidebyside
with
the
urboch
the
marzen
does
not
show
much
of
its
malt
body
smokiness
is
dominant
throughout
i
like
the
urbock
better
because
it
is
more
complex
this
is
a
decent
light
flavored
rauchbier
if
the
urbock
is
not
available
overall
this
is
quite
a
mild
and
refreshing
beer
not
what
i
was
expecting
based
on
previous
smoked
beer
experiences
everything
seems
so
ballanced
and
besides
the
smoke
other
sublte
flavours
come
through
best
of
the
style
so
far
for
this
guy
o
something
done
very
well
that
i
really
enjoyed
totally
unique
and
i
would
love
to
try
more
it
is
not
something
youd
likely
session
but
it
tastes
delicious
poured
from
a
brown
16
9
oz
bottle
has
a
very
dark
brown
color
with
a
12
inch
head
smell
is
of
smoked
meats
taste
is
unlike
anything
i
have
had
before
smoke
bacon
meaty
i
can
see
where
it
would
appeal
to
some
but
i
was
unable
to
finish
it
feels
medium
bodied
and
unpleasant
in
the
mouth
and
overall
i
did
not
enjoy
it
at
all
consumed
from
an
aecht
schlenkerla
pint
glass
this
makes
an
excellent
choice
for
relaxing
with
friends
while
eating
grilled
hot
dogs
on
a
hot
day
would
be
awesome
while
camping
or
fishing
mahogany
brown
in
color
with
deep
red
hues
and
good
clarity
pours
with
a
thick
light
beige
froth
that
dissipates
to
a
wispy
cap
but
leaves
plenty
of
sticky
lacings
on
the
glass
smells
like
smoked
ham
in
a
glass
smoke
malt
aroma
dominates
throughout
on
the
heavier
side
of
medium
bodied
with
a
silky
smooth
feel
smokey
flavor
throughout
but
mostly
upfront
bitter
hop
flavors
are
introduced
thru
the
middle
that
transition
to
a
brief
toasty
marzenlike
maltiness
if
smoked
is
your
thing
youll
like
this
however
its
not
mine
othis
is
the
perfect
beer
for
a
singlemalt
scotch
lover
highly
recommended
and
a
must
for
rauchbier
fans
o
for
the
first
rauchbier
i
try
this
beer
is
really
interesting
flavours
are
nicely
blended
making
a
very
drinkable
brew
which
would
pair
perfectly
with
a
grilled
meet
o
absolutely
delicious
what
can
i
say
this
would
be
perfect
with
eggs
sausage
and
pancakes
overall
ive
never
had
a
smoked
or
rauchbier
before
but
after
having
this
i
think
i
may
have
fallen
in
love
this
style
its
flavors
are
rich
and
smooth
which
compliment
its
easyonthepalette
feel
plus
it
tastes
like
smoked
bacon
in
a
good
way
d
im
not
a
regular
rauchbier
drinker
but
i
do
enjoy
the
occasional
one
and
this
is
definitely
one
id
pick
up
again
mellower
taste
transition
from
smokey
to
plums
were
real
pleasing
i
have
little
experience
with
rauchbier
but
this
was
definitely
interesting
more
refreshing
than
i
would
have
thought
i
really
got
the
summer
weekendhotdog
association
with
this
beer
im
going
to
take
one
of
these
camping
this
summer
d
nice
but
i
would
tire
after
1
or
2
i
cant
say
im
a
huge
fan
of
the
smoked
marzen
but
this
was
a
very
nice
taste
experience
overall
almost
a
perfect
beer
for
the
style
i
guess
when
you
make
rauchbier
this
long
you
really
can
get
it
down
but
wow
what
a
fantastic
beer
a
rauchbier
is
one
of
the
most
distinct
of
beer
flavors
aecht
does
this
better
than
anyone
else
i
know
of
and
their
märzen
version
can
only
be
challenged
by
their
urbock
version
for
topofclass
in
this
beer
style
overall
im
glad
i
was
able
to
find
this
at
a
local
store
but
i
wont
seek
it
out
again
for
myself
but
probably
to
share
with
others
no
head
smells
like
beef
jerky
taste
like
a
campfire
or
beechwood
lingers
in
the
cup
as
well
has
a
heavy
mouthfill
it
stays
in
your
mouth
after
a
few
swallows
i
wouldnt
recommend
this
beer
it
has
a
very
bitter
taste
but
the
smoke
makes
it
hard
to
get
past
anything
else
the
smell
hits
you
right
away
not
a
good
beer
the
best
smelling
beer
i
have
ever
smelled
in
my
entire
life
it
has
such
a
smoked
flavor
that
the
aroma
can
come
off
as
sort
of
a
liquid
bacon
ham
smoked
salmon
teriyaki
chicken
smell
delicious
the
taste
is
less
magnificent
but
its
smokey
and
does
not
have
a
heavy
mouthfeel
the
brown
color
is
also
pleasing
to
the
eye
and
corresponds
nicely
with
the
smell
this
beer
was
very
surprising
to
me
it
had
a
smoked
smell
which
i
have
never
smelled
in
a
beer
before
that
being
said
before
i
drank
i
did
not
think
it
would
go
down
smooth
surprisingly
this
beer
went
down
very
smooth
and
it
tasted
good
which
was
very
enjoyable
it
has
a
light
head
and
it
is
a
nice
dark
color
overall
this
is
a
decent
beer
due
in
part
to
the
fact
that
i
do
not
prefer
a
smoky
flavor
when
it
comes
to
beer
but
this
smokiness
flavor
does
bring
in
a
lot
of
complexity
when
tasting
and
smelling
it
because
it
is
out
of
the
ordinary
poured
this
into
my
tulip
and
let
it
sit
for
a
minute
and
my
wife
asked
if
i
had
smoked
summer
sausage
out
this
beer
pours
out
a
deep
brown
ith
some
ruby
highlights
a
half
finger
of
creamy
off
white
head
slowly
settles
to
a
nice
ring
with
little
lacing
smell
and
taste
are
amazing
both
are
filled
with
a
nice
smoked
sausage
flavor
that
is
complimented
well
with
a
nice
body
full
of
malt
mouthfeel
is
kinda
thick
and
chewy
but
goes
down
easy
with
a
soft
dry
smoky
finish
i
cant
believe
it
took
me
so
long
to
try
a
rauchbier
but
i
bet
it
wont
be
that
long
before
i
try
another
one
overall
drinkability
quite
drinkable
at
first
i
was
a
little
bit
concerned
due
to
the
interesting
smell
the
phenol
but
the
more
i
drank
the
more
i
liked
it
and
the
more
drinkable
it
became
went
fantastic
with
pork
chops
and
green
beans
and
i
think
would
go
really
well
with
a
variety
of
other
meat
dishes
i
think
that
the
smoke
is
just
right
too
much
and
it
could
really
overpower
everything
but
here
nicely
balanced
prominent
but
not
domineering
a
very
good
beer
overall
and
again
nicely
drinkable
poured
into
small
german
glass
bier
stein
deep
copper
hues
but
you
cant
see
through
it
two
finger
head
fades
to
short
head
with
some
lacy
stickiness
on
the
side
of
the
glass
called
bacon
beer
by
the
americans
in
germany
the
first
whiff
gives
on
the
impression
of
smoked
pork
the
smoke
definitely
comes
through
in
the
flavor
dominating
the
dark
beer
notes
leaving
a
bitter
taste
on
the
back
of
the
tongue
not
for
the
faint
of
heart
but
definitely
for
the
adventurous
probably
helps
that
i
just
finished
a
plate
of
german
wurst
noodles
and
vegetables
one
finger
light
tan
head
in
one
glass
minimal
head
in
the
other
quick
dissipation
in
both
broken
layer
of
head
on
former
and
a
small
ring
around
edge
of
glass
in
latter
medium
brown
clear
body
a
few
streams
of
bubbles
visible
rising
around
the
edge
of
the
glass
holy
smokes
or
in
the
words
of
john
michaelsen
good
grief
smoke
bomb
on
the
nose
fairly
sweet
malts
for
balance
floral
hops
absolutely
subsumed
by
the
smoky
aromas
one
of
the
most
unique
smelling
beers
on
planet
earth
the
smoky
profile
continues
tastewise
more
smoky
wood
than
ashtray
fairly
sweet
in
the
middle
typical
marzen
profile
except
for
the
smoke
faint
floral
hops
on
backend
mouthfeel
is
medium
good
effervescence
not
something
i
could
drink
all
the
time
nor
finish
the
entire
bottle
by
myself
only
downside
is
this
beer
absolutely
trashes
your
palate
tried
to
refresh
with
a
dipa
and
i
still
tasted
the
smoke
until
halfway
through
that
beer
an
absolute
must
for
lovers
of
smoky
beers
the
benchmark
that
all
rauchbiers
along
with
the
urbock
must
be
measured
against
o
if
you
like
smokedrauch
beer
this
is
it
great
smokey
tones
go
with
this
incredibly
easy
drinking
marzen
which
is
medium
body
and
big
flavor
will
buy
this
any
time
i
need
a
rauchbier
fix
this
is
a
unique
beer
i
will
pair
this
one
with
food
next
time
if
you
like
it
try
it
again
if
you
dont
at
least
you
can
say
you
have
had
the
world
famous
rauchbier
by
schlenkerla
well
this
is
the
best
smoked
beer
i
have
had
easily
it
has
notes
of
bbq
honeybaked
ham
and
campfire
smoke
so
if
thats
your
thing
i
cant
imagine
anything
better
that
said
this
beer
style
is
not
for
me
and
i
am
not
into
this
beer
at
all
overall
it
was
my
first
rauchbier
so
im
not
sure
what
to
say
that
being
said
it
was
far
too
much
smoke
for
me
to
drink
alone
im
likely
to
split
my
other
or
to
wait
to
open
it
until
i
do
some
cooking
o
excellent
rauchbiers
are
my
new
kick
and
i
look
forward
to
enjoying
this
one
often
with
spicy
foods
overall
buy
it
today
not
a
sixpack
this
one
you
should
savor
i
poured
from
a
bomber
into
a
nonic
dark
pour
with
a
medium
white
head
the
aroma
is
lots
of
smoke
some
saltiness
bacon
a
lot
of
smoke
cured
meats
bit
of
malty
sweetness
it
finishes
with
more
smoke
the
body
is
full
good
carbonation
not
everyday
beer
nice
change
overall
very
nice
easy
to
drink
beer
not
quite
as
smokey
flavored
as
i
figured
judging
from
the
smell
would
be
a
killer
beer
to
eat
meat
with
or
smoke
a
cigar
with
alcohol
is
masked
very
well
its
a
little
pricey
but
other
then
that
well
done
overall
the
body
of
the
beer
is
light
and
the
finish
is
really
strong
this
is
one
of
the
better
smoke
beer
i
have
tried
nonetheless
it
is
still
difficult
to
drink
gettin
back
to
my
smoky
roots
with
one
of
the
first
rauchbiers
i
tried
it
pours
a
clear
sunset
garnet
topped
by
a
finger
or
so
of
sandy
tan
foam
the
nose
comprises
rich
woody
almost
barbecuelike
smoke
hanging
like
a
heavy
pall
over
some
sweet
creamy
caramel
good
times
indeed
the
taste
brings
some
even
darker
smoke
but
beyond
that
keeps
things
pretty
steady
smoky
indeed
the
body
is
a
light
medium
with
a
light
moderate
carbonation
and
a
pretty
dry
finish
overall
one
of
the
best
rauchbiers
out
there
nuff
said
avant
garde
guys
like
me
should
check
out

gies
whispering

drinkability
smoky
woody
with
a
balancing
malt
foundation
this
beer
has
great
character
and
balance
and
is
an
incredibly
easy
drinking
beer
the
perfect
pint
for
a
cold
new
england
fall
night
half
litre
bottle
poured
into
pint
glass
one
and
a
half
finger
tanned
head
which
went
quickly
dark
mahogany
colour
clear
at
the
edges
cloudy
in
the
middle
very
distinct

was
like
being
in
a
room
full
of
smoked
ham
strong
malty
smoked
taste
not
too
muchgoing
on
apart
from
smoke
was
surprised
by
the
high
amount
of
carbonation
poured
from

into
dfh
snifter
pours

dark
brown

transparent

nothing

maybe
a

of
cherry
or
sweet
fruit
on
the
front
of
the
palate
on
the
end
some
roasty
bitterness
this
is
a
well
balanced
nice
beer
i
am
not
generally
a
fan
of
rauchbier
but
this
one
is
really
nice
great
beer
all
around
with
just
the
right
amount
of
smokeyness
o
a
really
solid
brew
i
will
be
getting
this
again
d
i
call
this
smoke
mild
but
im
sure
to
most
this
is
still
pretty
smoky
great
balance
between
smoked
and
nonsmoked
malts
the
dry
finish
makes
this
brew
easy
for
me
to
revisit
pretty
tasty
stuff
and
definitely
a
nice
change
of
pace
from
what
i
usually
drink
i
havent
had
a
lot
of
smoked
beers
but
its
not
hard
to
see
why
this
one
is
so
highly
acclaimed
ill
probably
get
this
again
at
some
point
except
i
have
never
seen
it
stocked
at
a
local
liquor
store
so
this
might
be
my
only
bottle
for
quite
a
while
o
this
is
what
a
smoked
beer
should
taste
like
the
smoke
is
everpresent
but
not
overwhelming
obviously
not
for
someone
whos
not
a
fan
of
the
rauchbier
style
its
by
far
the
best
that
ive
ever
had
d
ive
had
these
beer
on
several
occasions
ontap
and
in
the
bottle
but
have
never
rated
it
among
rauchbeers
this
is
the
leader
of
the
pack
in
terms
of
originality
and
taste
the
beer
however
is
relatively
heavy
and
hard
to
drink
more
than
a
few
without
feeling
weigheddown
well
dang
i
remembered
this
as
better
than
it
is
now
etc
etc
story
weve
all
heard
and
told
before
ive
just
spoiled
myself
on
the
nicest
rauchs
i
can
get
my
hands
on
i
guess
but
the
original
still
stacks
up
i
am
really
glad
i
decided
to
try
this
again
now
i
am
wanting
to
try
more
rauchbiers
and
wish
more
were
available
all
in
all
i
was
glad
for
the
chance
to
expand
the
horizon
on
my
journey
to
learn
more
about
beer
if
youve
never
tried
a
smoked
beer
before
its
definitely
worthwhile
to
experience
the
flavor
at
least
once
however
i
would
recommend
picking
up
a
single
bottle
to
try
while
i
would
partake
of
a
smoked
beer
again
its
not
on
my
must
drink
again
soon
list
really
is
an
acquired
taste
and
my
wife
hates
this
beer
weve
been
to
bamberg
a
few
times
i
am
not
a
smoked
bacon
guy
nor
do
i
smoke
or
eat
much
smoked
ham
or
cheeses
but
i
do
like
this
beer
i
enjoyed
this
beer
im
not
sure
i
woud
want
to
drink
it
all
the
time
but
is
is
unique
and
very
wellmade
this
one
and
the
urbock
are
my
two
favorite
from
schlenkerla
i
might
have
to
go
with
this
one
though
i
might
be
being
bias
too
i
love
marzen
and
this
is
an
interesting
twist
on
the
other
hand
the
smokiness
sort
of
drowns
out
some
of
the
traditional
marzen
traits
it
has
a
dark
brown
body
with
a
bit
of
orange
hue
the
aroma
is
not
as
marzen
like
this
is
the
main
thing
that
takes
a
backseat
to
the
smokiness
in
the
beer
it
has
that
old
smokehouse
scent
just
like
all
their
beers
the
taste
is
meaty
and
there
is
subtle
sweet
roasted
malt
flavor
before
the
smoke
sets
in
the
body
is
medium
and
this
is
a
great
heavy
meal
beer
could
be
my
senses
arent
ready
for
these
flavors
in
a
beverage
but
in
reviewing
the
style
i
think
its
a
top
notch
representation
lots
of
smoke
wood
and
not
much
else
wow
like
drinking
a
campfire
pours
a
slightly
transparent
deep
brown
smells
like
a
scotch
ale
on
steroids
peat
smoke
mmmm
extremely
intense
smoke
smell
and
smoke
flavor
through
and
through
on
the
heavier
side
of
medium
bodied
insanely
unique
beer
never
had
anything
quite
like
this
could
imagine
it
going
amazing
with
some
grilled
pork
loin
a
must
try
this
fall
this
was
perfect
for
an
afternoon
of
grilling
the
smoke
added
another
level
of
complexity
to
the
beer
along
with
the
good
depth
and
complexity
to
begin
with
this
was
a
really
good
beer
that
was
very
easy
to
drink
enjoy
poured
a
clear
dark
brown
with
a
fluffy
khakicolored
head
wonderfully
smoky
aromas
mingle
with
dark
german
malts
and
a
distinctive
baked
brown
bread
character
smoke
is
very
nice
walks
the
line
between
campfire
and
meat
nicely
taste
is
quite
similar
to
the
nose
the
smoke
character
is
delicate
and
sweet
and
compliments
the
bready
malt
profile
nicely
mouthfeel
is
smooth
and
creamy
with
a
touchovermedium
body
and
good
carbonation
i
could
easily
sip
on
this
all
day
anytime
but
on
a
cool
fall
day
nothing
is
better
overall
a
really
nice
marriage
of
two
styles
one
of
my
favorite
oktoberfests
every
year
overall
great
looking
beer
the
smoke
was
strong
but
not
completely
overpowering
id
have
another
i
was
excited
to
see
this
on
cask
pours
a
black
brownish
color
which
only
allows
light
around
the
edges
with
a
tan
one
finger
head
the
head
gives
way
to
gobs
of
lace
up
and
down
the
glass
the
aroma
has
a
big
smoky
aroma
the
smoke
smells
like
a
camp
fire
with
some
spice
present
the
taste
follows
suit
with
a
caramel
malt
backbone
and
then
a
big
smokey
flavor
the
bbq
flavor
along
with
spice
and
beef
jerky
become
more
pronounced
the
mouthfeel
is
moderately
carbonated
overall
a
great
beer
nice
big
smokey
aroma
and
flavor
the
beer
becomes
more
enjoyable
as
you
go
pours
dark
brown
with
a
mocha
head
that
fades
fast
smell
has
huge
smoke
with
some
sweet
notes
the
smoke
flavor
is
layered
a
mix
between
barbecue
and
fireplace
the
flavor
starts
somewhat
sweet
and
moves
into
the
smoke
flavor
which
isnt
overpowering
but
still
the
main
focus
the
smoke
lingers
in
the
aftertaste
and
stays
on
the
palette
the
mouthfeel
is
mediumlight
smooth
and
enjoyable
overall
a
great
beer
the
smoke
was
done
well
with
the
complex
flavor
thinner
medium
body
higher
carbonation
a
little
watery
on
the
tongue
dryness
lingers
really
interesting
and
tasty
smokiness
although
the
body
wasnt
great
overall
a
superior
rauchbier
very
enjoyable
it
was
much
easier
to
drink
than
i
expected
i
would
totally
have
this
again
overall
definitely
a
unique
style
and
interesting
to
try
not
so
sure
i
will
seek
out
again
though
malty
aroma
has
a
fruity
and
floral
overtone
and
a
hint
of
hickory
smoke
it
pours
a
dark
barely
translucent
brown
with
a
thick
velvety
yellowish
tan
head
that
looks
a
lot
like
the
head
on
a
property
poured
crater
of
guinness
flavor
has
malty
fruity
and
hickory
smoke
tones
whoa
is
that
bacon
i
taste
there
is
also
just
a
hint
of
caramel
body
is
a
bit
lacking
but
texture
is
still
fairly
fizzy
and
leaves
a
tasty
finish
o
a
unique
experience
as
i
have
never
had
a
smokebeer
would
be
a
good
selection
if
on
a
camping
trip
or
enjoying
a
crisp
and
cool
autumn
day
a
classic
representative
of
the
rauchbier
style
warm
tangy
and
not
overpowering
ok
this
is
the
rauchbier
others
are
measured
by
still
i
think
it
could
gain
from
a
little
more
hops
and
forest
fire
a
smoked
marzen
perhaps
the
standardbearer
for
the
style
it
pours
a
rich
dark
brown
color
with
a
wonderfully
smokey
aroma
a
big
bouquet
of
smokey
goodness
that
surprises
on
the
palate
its
not
as
bold
tasting
as
one
might
expect
rather
the
smokiness
comes
across
as
mellow
and
wellbalanced
it
doesnt
drop
out
nor
does
it
overpower
rather
the
notes
are
there
and
remain
present
as
it
warms
much
like
a
mildtasting
scotch
the
carbonation
holds
up
and
its
effervescence
helps
the
smoke
come
across
im
a
big
fan
of
smoked
beers
so
count
me
as
a
fan
of
this
one
light
but
unique
a
greater
concentration
of
flavors
would
improve
this
for
me
the
wateriness
was
disappointing
this
was
the
first
smoked
beer
i
have
ever
drank
so
it
holds
a
special
spot
in
my
heart
but
i
think
i
have
had
better
smoked
beer
and
the
smoke
flavor
seems
to
be
more
that
of
a
hardwood
rather
than
a
fruit
wood
the
one
ive
definitely
had
the
most
the
easiest
to
find
and
in
my
opinion
the
meatiest
there
is
the
harvest
apple
note
that
makes
it
have
the
sweetness
of
applegate
bacon
pour
is
amber
with
a
very
slight
off
white
head
nice
built
of
something
much
creamier
than
expected
a
benchmark
if
i
was
on
a
desert
island
and
i
had
to
choose
one
rauch
it
would
be
from
this
brewery
the
only
distinct
difference
is
the
meat
youre
suggestively
eating
with
it
this
i
would
say
it
just
right
for
chinese
bbq
pork
light
sweet
like
grain
savory
mineral
smoke
dry
overall
if
you
havent
had
a
schlenkerla
rauchbier
you
need
to
period
end
of
sentence
fin
thats
all
folks
overall
a
very
smoky
and
interesting
beer
i
enjoy
it
a
lot
but
it
is
not
for
everyone
o
i
was
blown
away
by
this
when
i
had
it
almost
10
months
ago
but
now
that
ive
had
it
a
few
more
times
and
delved
into
the
style
a
bit
im
sure
this
is
top
notch
o
overall
quite
tasty
it
may
be
a
little
overpowering
on
the
smokey
side
but
it
is
delicious
none
the
less
perhaps
a
good
introduction
to
the
style
but
i
dont
think
id
be
too
likely
to
have
a
few
in
a
row
maybe
one
of
two
but
id
stop
there
from
a
bottle
pours
a
clear
dark
burgundy
with
a
nice
head
nose
is
smoked
meat
tending
toward
ham
salt
pork
not
so
much
bacon
in
this
case
salty
and
light
pleasant
mouth
is
soft
smoked
ham
very
light
somehow
airy
i
picture
cubed
hunks
of
artisan
ham
here
yep
artisan
ham
fluffy
with
an
appropriate
bittering
hop
near
the
finish
dry
nice
stuff
o
very
satisfying
to
nurse
at
home
on
a
cold
night
very
similar
to
the
urbock
in
every
way
to
my
palate
and
like
the
urbock
is
pretty
unforgettable
overall
smoked
beers
you
hate
them
or
you
like
them
we
had
a
tasting
with
4
people
i
was
the
only
one
that
didnt
drainpour
this
one
one
of
the
better
ones
on
the
market
o
really
nice
beer
this
is
the
first
true
rauchbier
ive
had
and
it
was
really
good
t
he
only
thing
i
can
say
is
that
the
mouthfeel
is
a
little
thin
after
that
huge
campfire
scent
its
not
bad
just
thought
i
would
get
something
bigger
however
i
cant
really
judge
as
i
am
new
to
the
style
di
like
that
this
rauchbiersmoked
beer
isnt
overwhelmingly
rich
i
find
this
really
aids
the
drinkability
as
the
smoke
qualities
bring
in
a
richness
of
their
own
it
was
a
little
thin
but
a
nice
warmth
and
dry
finish
overall
it
was
delicious
this
is
a
sipper
to
enjoy
with
a
smokey
meal
perhaps
a
meatlovers
pizza
overall
a
very
nice
rauchbier
with
solid
smoke
taste
and
pretty
affordable
to
boot
this
brew
pours
a
deep
mahogany
hue
with
average
carbonation
that
leaves
behind
an
one
finger
head
and
sporadic
lacingthe
smell
is
wow
straight
out
smokey
woodfire
and
crispy
burnt
baconit
has
a
medium
bodied
very
drinkable
mouthfeel
with
tastes
of
burnt
baconsmoked
woodcandied
fruits
and
finishes
with
a
pleasant
spicy
hop
dryness
and
overall
a
beautiful
example
of
the
style
and
truly
tasty
would
buy
again
d
while
i
really
like
this
beer
i
would
think
drinking
more
than
one
in
a
session
would
be
detrimental
to
my
palate
and
might
destroy
my
ability
to
taste
anything
else
while
enjoying
multiples
of
this
beer
o
the
aroma
is
so
overpowering
it
almost
makes
you
not
want
to
drink
more
but
when
you
force
yourself
to
drink
more
its
amazing
like
it
for
the
experience
but
hate
it
for
more
than
a
once
a
year
beer
edit
i
will
have
to
admit
that
this
has
grown
on
me
a
little
since
my
visit
i
still
prefer
the
one
from
spezial
and
wish
i
could
get
it
more
readily
but
this
is
still
a
beer
i
randomly
crave
here
and
there
the
bottled
version
still
has
more
smoke
than
the
draft
one
but
its
tasty
nonetheless
t
one
quick
note
on
pairing
i
would
not
pair
this
beer
with
smoked
foods
i
e
pulled
pork
briscut
or
cheese
it
is
impossible
to
appreciate
the
smoke
character
when
paired
with
smoked
foods
i
was
at
the
american
royal
in
kc
last
year
and
decided
to
bring
both
the
aecht
urbock
and
marzen
to
taste
with
some
smoked
pork
shoulder
a
buddy
of
mine
was
entering
the
shoulder
ran
roughshod
over
the
beer
the
beers
both
tasted
like
above
average
dark
german
lagers
just
my
two
cents
pours
a
clear
dark
brown
with
a
1
inch
light
tan
head
that
fades
to
a
thin
cap
thin
rings
of
lace
and
random
splotches
of
lace
form
around
the
glass
on
the
drink
down
smells
of
smoked
meats
campfire
and
bandaids
taste
is
of
smoked
sausages
liquid
smoke
bandaids
and
roasted
malts
on
the
finish
the
bitter
smoke
flavors
fade
quickly
after
each
sip
this
beer
has
a
good
level
of
carbonation
with
a
crisp
and
smooth
mouthfeel
overall
this
is
a
very
interesting
beer
this
is
the
first
of
the
style
that
i
have
had
and
it
wasnt
as
bad
as
i
thought
it
was
going
to
be
i
would
try
other
rauchbiers
in
the
future
poured
from
a
500
ml
bottle
a
dark
brown
brew
with
a
sizable
head
and
some
lace
sticking
to
the
glass
aroma
of
most
delicious
bbq
meat
and
smoke
obviously
from
the
beechwood
smoked
malts
a
lush
caramel

is
a
great
palate
for
the
smoke
to
dance
on
malty
roasty
smokey
fantastic
kind
of
tastes
like
how
a
dying
fire
smells
there
is
a
subtle
malt
sweetness
that
works
with
the
smoke
malt
comes
off
roasted
a
seperate
flavor
from
the
smoke
hops
are
lightly
bitter
but
barely
percievable
until
the
finish
there
is
a
lingering
smoked
meat
flavor
that
sticks
with
you
as
it
sticks
to
the
beer
mouthfeel
is
medium
bodied
carbonation
is
about
right
moderate
overall
a
great
rauch
epitomizes
the
style
went
well
with
grilled
steak
quesadillas
and
smoked
poblano
salsa
the
marzen
nuances
may
very
well
get
lost
here
but
so
what
o
a
very
nice
rauchbeir
though
i
was
done
about
half
through
the
glass
as
i
drank
on
the
smoke
seemed
develop
a
more
chemicallike
aspect
to
it
which
hindered
the
drinkability
a
bit

short

its
smoky
like
that
theres
a
subtle
nutty
malt
aroma
in
the
back
that
smokiness
carries
over
abundantly
into
the
taste
theres
a
bit
of
a
spicy
bready
note
in
there
and
after
the
smoke
clears
theres
a
rich
maltiness
in
the
back
fighting
for
stage
presence
the
lesser
side
of
this
is
the
feel
bit
to
far
on
the
light
end
of
things
overall
though
solid
rauchbier

really
this
brew
poured
out
as
a
brown
color
there
was
a
decent
head
at
first
but
went
away
quickly
the
smell
of
the
beer
is
a
super
smokey
it
was
like
being
near
a
fire
or
something
the
taste
brought
the
same
smoked
strength
onto
the
tongue
for
a
salty
baconlike
experience
the
mouthfeel
was
pretty
smooth
though
and
was
drinkable
enough
to
finish
my
glass
the
beer
overall
isnt
really
my
favorite
style
i
think
sometimes
the
smoke
is
too
much
and
it
hinders
the
brew
i
try
to
give
each
of
these
a
fair
chance
od
smoother
than
youd
think
not
exactly
a
warm
summer
patio
beer
but
it
has
its
place
and
for
such
a
rare
style
it
seems
well
put
together
d
its
hard
to
gauge
how
easy
this
is
to
drink
on
one
hand
its
a
bit
of
an
acquired
taste
as
is
usual
for
the
style
on
the
other
its
superbly
balanced
with
a
nuanced
flavour
profile
with
that
said
its
unquestionably
worth
buying
if
only
for
the
experience
and
an
excellent
rauchbier
altogether
overall
quite
fine
an
excellent
beer
with
interesting
and
delicious
smoke
flavor
this
by
far
is
the
best
rauchbeer
ive
ever
had
a
true
example
of
brewing

awesome
no

again
it

some

that
even

harm
it
the

you

the

this

this

actually
very
easy
to
drink
not
too
complex
but
still
very
nuanced
cold
somewhat
inactive
drink
not
too
sure
about
this

as
a
winter

throughout

the
aroma
was
comprised
of

pork
the
flavor
was
of
roasted

smoke
ham
pork
and
slight
bacon
it
had
a
light
feel
on
the

with

overall
this
was
a
pretty
nice
brew
definitely
had
a
great
smoked

flavor
aspect
going
on
in
this
one
i
really
needed
to
have
bbq
with
this
brew
it
would
have
made
me
appreciate
it
soooo
much
more
seems
like
all
of
the
rauchbiers
ive
had
lately
make
me
want
bbq
maybe
it
is
a
sign
great
flavor
and
aroma
going
on
here
a
definite
must
try
for
any
rauchbier
fan
or
smoked
meat
fan
out
there
without
a
doubt
o
you
know
its
just
not
my
thing
but
ive
graded
this
one
with
style
in
mind
as
i
feel
like
this
is
a
pretty
good
example
if
you
read
up
on
what
the
style
is
about
if
rauchbiers
are
your
thing
this
one
probably
ranks
up
there
good
for
the
style
other
than
the
mouthfeel
was
a
letdown
and
a
good
enough
experience
i
guess
othis
is
great
im
glad
it
is
readily
available
where
i
live
could
be
the
difference
in
my
preference
bw
weizen
and
marzen
i
like
weizen
beers
better
and
liked
it
better
overall
good
taste
and
aroma
im
a
bit
bothered
by
the
lingering
hop
grassy
taste
at
the
finish
o
this
has
good
drinkability
this
is
my
first
rauchbier
and
i
have
to
admit
i
was
a
little
nervous
to
try
it
it
is
definitely
a
very
interesting
beer
it
has
a
nice
smokiness
that
i
thought
worked
really
well
with
the
toasted
malt
background
i
could
definitely
see
this
one
pairing
really
well
with
food
i
am
looking
forward
to
trying
more
beers
of
this
style
and
i
would
definitely
drink
this
one
again
drinkability
awesome
and
great
for
pairing
with
foods
o
highly
drinkable
and
absolutely
delicious
drinking
this
beer
really
puts
you
in
the
mood
for
a
barbecue
this
beer
is
all
about
the
smoke
and
its
always
nice
to
see
a
beer
really
focus
on
one
simple
characteristic
and
do
it
perfectly
drinkability
one
amazing
beer
that
must
be
had
by
all
beer
lovers
i
know
alot
of
people
dont
like
smoke
beers
but
this
may
be
the
one
that
turns
there
opinion
around
aecht
schlenkerla
rauchbier
is
the
most
authentic
of
any
rauchbiers
ive
ever
had
its
smooth
smokey
and
easy
to
sip
ive
yet
to
try
this
with
some
smoked
bbq
but
i
can
imagine
it
is
amazing
very
glad
i
tried
this
and
look
forward
to
trying
many
more
beers
from
the
cellars
of
schlenkerla
in
bamberg
o
probably
my
favorite
from
the
brewery
pours
pretty
dark
good
amount
of
head
smells
malty
and
pretty
smoky
tasting
it
tastes
like
a
bonfire
in
my
mouth
its
very
smokey
no
joke
not
bad
either
but
its
kind
of
boring
its
just
a
ton
of
smoke
with
some
malts
and
it
feels
like
it
could
use
some
other
kick
otherwise
glad
i
bought
this
beer
o
this
wasnt
as
bad
as
i
had
remembered
it
being
but
i
still
wouldnt
drink
more
than
a
few
ounces
of
it
i
cant
think
of
a
better
beer
for
a
barbecue
pairs
amazingly
o
a
very
interesting
and
unique
beer
much
more
palatable
than
anticipated
successfully
fills
both
roles
as
a
rauchbier
and
a
marzen
probably
not
a
favorite
but
would
have
again
o
overall
it
was
not
very
enjoyable
to
drink
at
least
for
me
felt
like
i
was
drinking
bacon
juice
drinkability
is
ok
based
on
the
smell
alone
i
thought
this
was
going
to
be
much
worse
but
the
smokiness
in
the
flavor
although
powerful
is
wellbalanced
with
the
rest
of
the
flavors
i
liked
the
beer
and
i
want
to
try
it
again
with
some
german
sausage
or
roast
saurbraaten
i
just
dont
want
a
splinter
from
all
the
charred
wook
making
this
just
a
joke
that
isnt
possible
overall
on
tap
or
in
the
bottle
this
beer
just
delivers
in
spades
super
drinkable
and
just
meets
expectations
in
feel
all
around
poured
a
clear
medium
brown
with
an
average
sized
offwhite
creamy
head
that
was
mostly
lasting
and
had
fair
lacing
the
aroma
was
of
smoked
malts
a
moldy
yeast
with
a
heavy
note
of
smoke
and
meat
like
a
smoked
ham
it
tasted
a
little
acidic
that
had
a
mild
malt
flavor
and
an
intense
smokey
flavor
from
start
to
finish
with
the
flavor
lingering
on
the
taste
buds
for
a
long
while
mouthfeel
was
light
to
medium
in
body
and
watery
yet
creamy
in
texture
with
a
soft
carbonation
overall
a
very
different
brew
than
what
i
am
used
to
kind
of
like
drinking
liquid
smoke
not
all
beers
are
for
everyone
and
this
one
is
definitely
not
for
me
very
impressed
with
my
first
smoked
beer
and
did
not
allow
personal
tastes
to
shy
me
away
not
very
thirst
quenching
nor
crisp
in
the
least
bit
but
agree
that
this
should
be
paired
with
fatty
foods
maybe
meats
but
i
enjoyed
half
of
it
before
some
crispy
chicken
artichoke
pizza
made
it
all
the
better
i
will
buy
this
again
as
a
treat
or
to
break
someone
else
into
smoke
beers
this
is
a
surprisingly
drinkable
beer
that
may
be
a
bit
of
an
acquired
taste
i
think
it
would
be
best
paired
with
some
smoked
meats
turkey
butts
or
something
and
you
could
maybe
even
make
it
a
night
with
some
rice
and
things
i
expected
a
2
x
4
of
smoke
to
the
head
but
what
this
beer
gave
me
was
more
subtle
clean
and
light
than
expected
sometimes
less
is
more
this
is
a
fantastically
crafted
smoke
beer
pretty
tasty
on
its
own
but
it
pairs
phenomenally
with
so
many
foodsa
great
beer
to
have
on
hand
at
all
times
md
the
mouth
feel
is
a
bit
watery
although
nice
and
coating
no
alcohol
flavor
with
a
nice
mixture
of
sweet
and
smoky
bitterness
the
smoke
intermingles
perfectly
with
the
light
bittering
hops
and
sweet
base
this
is
the
best
smoked
beer
ive
tried
so
far
the
smoke
flavors
dont
muddle
the
beer
and
instead
refine
it
to
a
nicely
balanced
sweet
and
smoky
experience
fairly
easygoing
and
drinkable
with
a
low
abv
at
5
1
although
the
beer
is
not
something
i
would
pick
for
a
session
i
would
drink
this
again
and
would
be
curious
to
see
how
it
pairs
with
food
i
was
supprised
at
how
good
this
beer
tasted
not
only
was
this
my
first
ba
review
this
was
my
first
rauchbier
and
ill
admit
to
being
a
bit
intimidated
by
the
smokebeer
label
the
smokey
characteristics
are
quite
subtle
and
lend
themselves
to
a
fine
brew
given
the
circumstances
i
would
happily
drink
a
boatload
d
highly
drinkable
i
presume
your
tastebuds
slowly
acclimate
to
the
smokiness
and
after
one
of
these
the
next
would
become
more
highly
drinkable
d
one
of
my
favorite
beers
probably
because
the
smokiness
aromas
and
flavors
drive
me
crazy
overall
the
beer
makes
my
mouth
water
and
then
settles
in
quite
nicely
and
pairs
well
with
cheese
such
as
gouda
this
is
a
good
beer
great
with
wings
smokiness
is
almost
overwhelming
tasty
treat
but
not
an
every
day
drinker
poured
from
12
oz
bottle
into
a
tulip
glass
pours
a
thin
beige
head
over
a
clear
reddish
brown
black
body
aroma
is
primarily
smoke
with
a
bit
of
grilled
meat
and
sweet
malts
taste
initially
is
toffee
then
balanced
by
smoke
and
then
mild
hop
bitterness
mouthfeel
is
relatively
light
carbonation
low
smoked
beers
are
interestingly
different
from
each
other
this
one
is
a
campfire
in
a
glass
cant
stay
this
is
my
style
of
beer
d
very
easy
to
drink
could
go
very
well
with
barbecue
food
drinkability
nicely
drinkable
beer
that
goes
perfectly
with
bbq
easy
to
quaff
this
beer
500
ml
bottle
served
in
a
mug
the
beer
pours
a
clear
ruby
redbrown
color
with
a
couple
inch
frothy
offwhite
head
head
retention
and
lacing
are
both
pretty
good
aroma
is
mostly
smoked
meatbacon
and
some
bready
malt
taste
is
pretty
much
the
same
as
the
aroma
its
mostly
smoked
meat
and
some
roasted
malt
mouthfeelbody
is
medium
its
a
little
bit
coating
with
decent
carbonation
drinkability
is
pretty
good
its
very
smooth
and
easy
to
drink
this
is
one
of
the
better
rauchbiers
ive
tried
and
would
definitely
buy
this
again
i
thought
it
was
a
pretty
good
brew
i
loved
the
smokiness
in
both
the
taste
and
aroma
pours
a
dark
brownmahoghany
clear
with
a
few
fingers
of
eggshell
head
which
leaves
some
good
lace
and
moderate
retention
couldnt
imagine
how
that
could
be
improved
great
look
to
it
nose
is
smoked
everything
ham
sausage
and
meats
of
all
kinds
barbecueesque
with
an
underlying
caramel
sweetness
of
some
sort
to
complement
taste
is
smoke
from
the
getgo
rich
malts
barbecued
and
smoked
meats
on
the
palate
are
adequate
but
not
extensive
and
overpowering
smoke
still
in
the
finish
solid
feel
to
it
and
id
definitely
have
another
cant
wait
for
barbecue
season
to
roll
around
the
pairings
im
coming
up
with
as
i
drink
this
are
driving
me
nuts
overall
this
is
a
wonderful
beer
on
every
level
the
look
smell
and
taste
all
come
together
to
make
you
feel
right
at
home
in
bavaria
even
when
youre
thousands
of
miles
away
d
this
brewery
sets
the
bar
for
rauchbiers
when
i
have
a
hankering
for
a
rauchbier
schlenkerla
brews
are
the
first
thing
that
comes
to
mind
based
on
the
smell
i
was
expecting
more
in
your
face
smoky
flavor
but
was
i
wrong
there
is
no
smokiness
at
all
in
the
flavor
and
it
is
surprisingly
very
smooth
and
clean
a
beautiful
beer
d
i
would
like
to
do
some
food
pairings
with
this
but
i
dont
really
care
for
it
by
itself
drink
well
i
gave
it
a
shot
this
is
definitely
not
the
style
of
beer
for
me
i
see
that
others
have
mentioned
how
well
this
beer
compliments
certain
foods
but
to
me
this
beer
is
a
food
on
its
own
it
actually
tasted
like
meat
i
tried
to
get
through
the
bottle
but
unfortunately
i
had
to
drain
pour
i
even
had
to
break
out
my
last
sierra
nevada
celebration
ale
just
to
cleanse
my
palette
overall
for
the
style
excellent
beer
and
would
drink
again
i
have
to
think
that
drinking
more
than
a
pint
of
this
beer
in
one
sitting
is
difficult
for
anyone
and
the
flavors
are
so
powerful
i
am
fond
of
smoked
beers
this
one
is
a
treat
as
a
once
in
a
while
thing
but
too
bacon
heavy
for
regular
drinking
that
and
i
like
to
find
the
beer
in
my
glass
so
going
too
bacon
or
coffeeor
grapefruit
or
bourbonand
losing
the
beernessis
not
ideal
i
am
utterly
shocked
at
how
well
this
drinks
i
will
have
zero
problem
finishing
this
bottle
alone
the
flavor
is
perfect
and
the
smoke
does
not
overwhelm
at
all
this
is
top
notch
for
the
style
and
easy
to
drink
to
boot
great
beer
that
everyone
needs
to
try
at
least
once
pours
a
murky
brown
colour
with
hints
of
amber
thick
white
head
with
some
nice
lacing
really
nice
head
retention
smells
quite
smokey
almost
similar
to
the
smoke
from
bacon
so
any
beer
that
reminds
me
of
bacon
is
a
plus
i
believe
the
other
stuff
im
smelling
is
similar
to
salty
caramel
flavour
has
some
sweetness
but
the
aftertaste
is
quite
smokey
smooth
carbonation
level
im
really
enjoying
this
beer
now
note
5
1
seriously
if
you
ever
have
the
opportunity
to
try
this
beer
do
not
hesitate
extremely
tasty
amazing
smell
and
it
even
looks
good
to
boot
this
pours
a
very
dark
brown
with
a
thick
head
and
lots
of
lacing
the
first
thing
i
noticed
was
the
heavy
smoked
scent
i
immediately
got
excited
because
i
love
that
smell
and
i
couldnt
wait
to
taste
how
it
would
translate
into
a
beer
i
was
not
let
down
there
was
a
heavy
yet
not
overpowering
in
my
opinion
taste
of
smokiness
it
blended
well
with
the
maltiness
of
the
underlying
beer
and
the
hit
of
hops
in
the
background
it
isnt
something
i
would
drink
every
day
but
i
have
had
a
couple
since
my
first
taste
among
the
6
other
taste
testers
on
the
beer
in
my
group
i
was
the
only
one
that
enjoyed
it
and
boy
did
i
ever
ranked
as
one
of
my
all
time
favorites
it
has
an
outstanding
smell
the
initial
taste
is
an
earth
shaker
if
you
like
smoky
flavor
please
dont
die
before
you
sample
this
outstanding
from
start
to
finish
i
cant
rain
enough
accolades
on
this
gem
this
is
one
of
the
first
rauchbiers
that
i
tasted
and
remains
one
of
my
favorite
pours
a
dark
ruby
with
low
head
retention
smells
like
campfire
with
a
subtle
malt
background
tastes
like
bacon
mouthfeel
is
perfectly
smooth
really
one
of
my
favorite
german
beers
d
excellent
easy
to
drink
and
hits
the
rauchbier
notes
perfectly
it
is
the
original
apparently
drinkability
wow
the
beech
wood
smoke
is
absolutely
awesome
unfortunately
the
marzen
beer
style
is
too
bland
for
me
personally
i
guess
that
is
what
makes
this
beer
so
awesome
wonderful
beech
wood
smoke
in
a
beer
style
that
lets
the
smoke
be
the
highlight
d
good
beer
for
times
when
longing
for
the
outdoors
childhood
memories
and
for
occassional
novelty
beer
nice
nice
beer
not
among
the
top
of
the
smoke
beers
imo
although
having
been
to
geramany
the
rauchbiers
are
much
better
there
overall
this
is
a
decent
enough
beer
but
not
one
that
i
would
really
feel
the
desire
to
drink
again
i
liked
it
but
apparently
no
one
else
i
was
with
could
really
appreciate
this
one
pours
inky
black
with
a
tall
white
head
that
lingers
the
smell
is
indeed
smokey
it
almost
seems
like
the
smell
is
ridiculously
strong
since
my
friend
across
our
small
table
said
he
could
smell
smoke
when
i
poured
this
brew
in
reality
it
was
malty
and
smokey
and
the
taste
was
much
the
same
smoke
is
the
dominant
thing
here
people
if
you
somehow
came
upon
this
brew
and
were
unaware
that
this
was
a
large
component
of
the
beer
you
would
completely
thrown
i
think
to
be
honest
several
hours
afterward
i
would
taste
the
smoke
smell
in
the
back
of
my
throat
it
has
a
smooth
mouthfeel
but
due
to
the
unusual
experience
with
the
overwhelming
smokequality
id
say
its
not
an
easy
beer
to
drink
id
order
it
again
but
it
absolutely
scared
my
friends
off
and
would
not
recommend
it
to
people
who
are
not
used
to
strong
andor
odd
beers
try
this
beer
if
you
like
marzens
or
smoked
beers
d
pretty
easily
drinkable
especially
if
you
like
smokey
brews

very
rich

full
in

a

very
fine
flavor
and
really
fills
my
sense
with
pleasure
i
will
have
to
pick
up
more
my
next
beer
buying
adventure
pretty
big
and
sweet
for
a
marzen
for
such
a
nontraditional
or
more
traditional
actually
beer
spectacularly
balanced
layered
and
drinkable
ive
forgotten
the
smoke
by
the
3rd
sip
is
this
the
best
smoked
beer
out
there
the
body
is
comfortably
weighted
and
moderately
carbonated
very
smooth
tastes
and
soft
spice
notes
in
the
finish
the
smokey
bacon
roasted
honey
and
fried
pork
fat
flavors
that
dominate
the
aroma
is
one
thing
but
the
smooth
translation
from
nose
to
the
taste
and
the
smooth
finish
brings
this
beer
together
very
nicely
poured
into
a

mug
served
at
cellar
temp
fizzy
carbonation
sounds
like
soda
and
the
brown
body
looks
like
root
beer
smell
is
probably
the
most
unique
youll
find
in
a
bottle
it
reminds
me
of
a
smoldering
campfire
or
a
smoked
ham
at
easter
just
wonderful
anything
smoked
is
just
plain
better
taste
is
a
bit
more
subtle
than
the
nose
would
portray
lots
of
notes
of
bacon
wood
peat
and
ash
also
this
beer
is
not
very
chewy
as
it
is
quite
smooth
on
the
palate
it
became
a
bit
more
mellow
as
it
warmed
to
room
temp
granted
i
like
this
beer
a
lot
but
its
not
one
to
drink
several
at
a
time
the
smell
and
flavor
could
be
overpowering
if
you
are
not
in
the
right
mood
but
one
bottle
is
a
perfect
size
to
enjoy
i
dare
you
to
find
a
better
made
rauchbier
there
is
a
reason
this
one
is
called
the
original
i
was
not
expecting
to
like
this
beer
so
much
really
delicious
i
served
it
warm
as
i
am
currently
freezing
my
ass
off
i
was
anticipating
liquid
smoke
as
in
tremendously
oversmoked
but
actually
it
has
delectable
smoky
tones
to
the
beer
camp
fire
ashey
wood
flavors
a
wonderful
base
beer
under
the
rauch
flavor
it
would
have
been
successful
beer
regardless
of
the
smoked
malt
addition
caramel
dark
malt
character
good
germen
yeast
with
what
tastes
like
a
perfect
fermentation
would
definitely
have
another
sometime
great
beer
for
the
style
easy
drinker
although
i
might
tire
of
the
smoke
after
a
few
well
worth
a
try
cheers
wow
i
really
like
this
awesome
beer
for
the
style
much
smokies
and
baconlike
than
mikeller
beer
geek
bacon
drinks
easily
despite
the
potent
flavor
and
aroma
schlenkerla
has
long
been
my
favorite
rauchbier
for
the
simple
fact
that
they
do
it
better
than
anyone
else
no
other
brewer
can
deliver
the
complexity
and
the
pure
unadulterated
liquid
smokiness
and
drinkability
i
find
in
these
overall
this
is
an
excellent
beer
i
recently
read
about
this
beer
and
its
history
in
brew
magazine
and
read
of
this
bacon
flavor
i
just
figured
sure
its
maybe
a
hint
of
bacon
but
no
this
is
more
of
a
dominant
characteristic
of
the
beer
as
much
as
i
enjoyed
this
i
cant
say
this
will
be
a
frequented
beer
by
me
this
might
be
something
saved
for
special
occasions
during
the
winter
time
overall
i
highly
recommend
trying
this
one
d
just
flat
out
amazing
taste
it
just
doesnt
get
any
better
than
this
as
far
as
rauchbiers
go
full
flavor
body
and
aroma
its
all
here
highly
sessionable
i
really
wish
texas
would
start
importing
this
pours
a
dark
clear
brown
ruby
colour
with
a
good
amount
of
head
in
the
samuel
smith
pint
glass
a
lot
of
smoke
flavours
as
one
would
guess
with
this
beer
a
good
malty
finish
to
go
along
with
the
smoked
flavours
drinks
down
pretty
smooth
and
the
smoke
isnt
overpowering
at
all
as
i
was
worried
about
decent
beer
d
this
is
a
smoked
beer
that
is
not
over
the
top
smoke
to
the
point
that
it
would
not
be
enjoyable
good
example
of
the
style
this
beer
is
exceptionally
beautiful
to
pour
its
a
dark
mahogany
with
ruby
tints
and
a
pillowy
offwhite
head
which
lasts
throughout
most
of
the
beer
the
smell
is
fantastic
predominated
by
smokecured
meats
caramel
and
a
faint
hint
of
graininess
the
taste
is
very
good
smokecured
meats
predominates
but
is
not
overpowering
also
present
are
caramel
and
toasted
grains
with
a
hint
of
sweet
maltiness
this
is
a
very
well
crafted
rauchbier
the
mouthfeel
is
spoton
but
drinkability
well
it
is
what
it
is
i
prefer
this
beer
solo
without
food
and
when
i
drink
it
one
is
enough
drink
well
my
friends
the
mouthfeel
was
smooth
but
not
overly
carbonated
as
for
drinkability
i
cant
see
myself
having
more
than
one
at
the
moment
the
smoke
seems
to
be
a
touch
overpowering
but
i
would
definitely
try
this
beer
and
again
other
rauchbiers
for
that
matter
pours
a
clean
deep
copper
color
with
a
light
tan
head
in
the
aroma
smokey
woody
and
a
mixture
of
beef
and
pork
in
the
taste
light
smokey
wood
like
a
nice
dry
campfire
a
smooth
ad
medium
bodied
mouthfeel
with
a
dry
faint
campfire
aftertaste
it
is
like
drinking
next
to
a
campfire
with
a
small
fruit
hint
d
smoke
really
dominates
every
aspect
of
this
beer
while
i
enjoy
a
wellbalanced
smoked
porter
like
alaskan
i
felt
that
the
malts
are
too
smoked
and
burnt
for
a
marzen
very
very
tasty
like
highland
park
scotch
in
beer
form
taste
a
little
smoke
caramel
malts
and
hops
at
first
the
malt
and
hops
subside
and
the
smoke
really
shines
in
the
aftertaste
d
this
was
my
first
rauchbier
and
it
didnt
disappoint
pours
a
moderately
dark
copper
color
with
an
off
white
head
the
nose
brings
smoke
smoke
and
smoke
smoked
wood
chips
and
a
bit
of
char
almost
meaty
the
taste
confirms
this
latter
scent
as
this
really
starts
to
taste
like
bacon
thats
been
a
tad
bit
overdone
mouthfeel
is
nice
and
smoky
with
a
pleasant
finish
considering
what
it
is
this
drinks
really
well
d
its
a
delicious
high
quality
beer
but
i
can
only
drink
one
in
a
sitting
db
a
lighter
smoked
beer
i
would
like
a
bit
more
smokey
malt
but
still
enjoyed
it
i
want
more
fantastic
beer
which
rarely
gets
better
pours
a
clear
dark
amber
color
54
inch
head
of
an
offwhite
color
great
retention
and
great
lacing
smells
of
strong
smoke
sweet
malt
and
slight
roasted
malt
fits
the
style
of
a
rauchbier
mouth
feel
is
smooth
and
clean
with
an
average
carbonation
level
tastes
of
strong
smoke
slight
roasted
malt
sweet
malt
slight
yeast
and
a
hint
of
hop
overall
good
appearance
aroma
and
body
this
is
the
beer
that
saved
smoke
beer
for
me
instead
of
smelling
just
like
a
lit
fireworks
punk
like
the
first
sample
in
this
case
the
smoke
balances
with
other
smells
and
flavors
tastewise
im
getting
bacon
and
smoked
cheeses
although
i
wouldnt
want
this
every
night
i
pretty
much
enjoyed
the
marzen
a
unique
and
quality
product
mouthfeel
is
very
creamy
and
mediumbodied
basically
almost
finished
with
my
pint
as
i
complete
this
review
what
an
example
of
the
rauchbier
style
especially
as
my
first
officially
my
new
favorite
german
beer
gonna
keep
this
beer
in
mind
for
any
upcoming
bbqs
damn
the
smell
was
great
taste
was
good
i
wish
it
was
more
smoky
harsh
and
thick
but
it
is
what
it
is
i
question
the
freshness
coming
from
the
dusty
ol
import
shelves
on
the
expensive
side
for
a
german
import
still
stoked
to
try
the
other
ones
i
guess
this
is
what
rauchbiers
are
like
i
generally
like
smoked
things
but
the
combination
of
the
smoked
meats
with
the
sweetness
got
to
be
too
much
for
me
quickly
very
interesting
but
i
didnt
find
it
very
drinkable
a
very
intriguing
beer
and
one
id
like
to
try
again
andor
other
examples
of
this
unique
style
i
think
ill
be
revisiting
this
beer
as
the
colder
months
approach
i
really
didint
think
i
could
drink
this
smoked
stuff
but
when
consumed
in
the
context
of
this
ancient
restuarant
in
this
really
neat
medieval
town
i
was
hooked
yes
it
is
drinkable
but
the
excitement
would
be
gone
as
the
flavors
disappear
the
further
you
get
into
it
as
it
is
difficult
for
the
palate
to
keep
up
the
characteristic
identification
of
your
initial
sips
i
would
recommend
1
at
a
time
brownish
red
with
one
finger
head
quickly
fading
aroma
is
malty
with
overtone
of
smoked
meats
opens
with
sweet
caramel
maltiness
spicy
hops
bitterness
at
the
back
smoke
on
the
edges
of
the
aftertaste
medium
body
decent
carbonation
easy
to
drink
d
good
drinkability
though
i
might
personally
be
worn
out
by
the
burnt
maltwood
finish
after
a
few
still
a
solid
well
made
beer
creamy
carbonation
could
be
upped
a
little
i
must
say
that
if
your
in
the
mood
for
smoke
nothing
hits
the
spot
like
a
schlenkerla
d
goes
down
pretty
easy
but
the
flavor
is
so
overpowering
and
strong
that
i
cant
see
myself
wanting
a
second
not
a
bad
thing
just
dont
let
the
5
abv
make
you
think
youre
going
to
session
this
a
great
example
of
the
style
and
an
enjoyable
beer
all
around
d
i
definitely
want
to
try
this
one
again
as
i
previously
tried
their
weizen
and
i
was
a
big
fan
not
sure
id
do
multiple
smoked
beers
in
an
evening
as
the
flavor
profile
is
pretty
strong
and
id
be
satisfied
with
1
d
really
not
that
hard
to
drink
it
makes
for
a
great
marinade
as
well
as
pairing
with
grilled
food
i
like
it
a
lot
for
what
it
is
but
again
its
pretty
onedimensional
mediumbodied
and
very
drinkable
this
one
needs
a
second
review
this
is
probably
the
most
interesting
beer
ive
ever
had
to
be
honest
i
didnt
care
for
it
much
the
first
time
around
mostly
because
of
poor
foodpairing
the
second
and
subsequent
tastings
have
been
more
rewarding
give
it
a
chance
drinkability
strangely
alluring
wasnt
completely
sure
about
this
beer
for
the
first
half
but
then
i
just
wanted
more
and
more
it
can
be
hard
to
pair
this
marzen
with
food
but
it
can
also
be
easy
richly
smoked
cheeses
roast
beef
ribs
pulled
pork
sandwiches
fried
potatoes
and
absolutely
anything
barbecued
is
a
natural
match
for
this
magnificent
beer
no
doubt
it
is
one
of
my
favorites
and
will
always
have
a
place
in
my
fridge
ontap
at
redlight
redlight
in
orlando
fl
pours
a
dark
brownish
color
with
a
light
tan
head
the
aroma
is
fantastic
a
lot
of
smoked
malts
dominate
the
nose
the
taste
like
the
aroma
is
deliciously
smokey
this
beer
is
great
in
the
bottle
and
even
better
ontap
dvery
interesting
beer
quite
smoked
and
meaty
but
enough
balance
to
it
that
is
seems
to
work
very
well
together
and
be
enjoyable
plus
after
the
onslought
of
acidity
and
vinegar
of
la
folie
05
there
was
a
need
for
malt
drinkability
this
is
damn
good
stuff
very
unique
and
very
tasty
i
was
unsure
how
i
would
react
to
the
smoky
qualities
and
the
bacon
and
not
because
im
a
vegetarian
and
im
pleased
to
say
i
thoroughly
enjoyed
both
notes
overall
its
an
interesting
beer
but
its
not
one
that
i
could
see
myself
drinking
much
of
d
overall
marzen
style
is
very
drinkable
strong
smoke
makes
for
a
good
grilling
brew
this
was
poured
into
a
weihenstephan
glass
with
about
two
and
a
half
fingers
of
light
tan
head
atop
a
black
body
it
smells
very
strongly
of
smoke
with
some
malts
seeping
through
upon
tasting
i
find
the
smoke
very
baconlike
but
its
all
i
can
taste
i
nice
moderatebodied
beer
with
lowmed
carbonation
i
cant
drink
one
after
another
quite
tasty
though
i
like
schlenkerlas
helles
lagerbier
better
because
of
the
lighter
smoked
flavour
i
can
taste
other
parts
of
the
beer
better
all
around
really
good
i
think
this
is
going
on
my
list
of
things
to
pick
up
again
in
the
future
d
a
very
smoked
rauchbier
either
youll
love
it
or
hate
it
i
had
my
first
one
a
couple
of
years
back
then
i
hated
it
this
time
its
a
lot
better
dthis
is
one
of
those
beers
that
you
will
either
love
or
hate
a
really
great
and
different
style
to
try
to
drinkability
this
is
a
beer
i
just
couldnt
finish
not
even
on
a
bet
drinkability
this
beer
is
good
but
its
a
bit
much
to
consume
a
lot
of
im
going
to
enjoy
this
bottle
but
i
dont
think
im
likely
to
ever
have
two
in
a
sitting
medium
bodied
with
a
fair
amount
of
fine
carbonation
feels
pillowly
and
soft
in
the
mouth
the
first
time
i
had
this
it
was
a
bit
of
a
shock
but
after
giving
it
some
time
and
a
second
chance
knowing
what
im
getting
into
this
is
a
damned
good
beer
this
is
a
drinkable
piece
of
living
history
the
process
of
malting
the
barley
over
a
beechwood
fire
dating
back
to
a
time
before
someone
had
the
idea
of
malting
the
barley
in
a
kiln
i
think
i
want
to
hunt
for
more
rauchbiers
there
is
nothing
and
i
mean
nothing
like
a
beer
from
schlenkerla
the
marzen
like
all
other
beers
from
this
brewery
is
rank
with
smoke
from
top
to
bottom
from
beginning
to
end
and
let
us
not
leave
out
the
salted
ham
the
salami
the
tobacco
the
prosciutto
the
entire
pig
smoked
on
a
rod
slowly
without
the
apple
in
its
mouth
which
i
find
so
silly
anyhow
if
youre
careful
youll
detect
some
light
hops
at
the
end
which
adds
just
a
nip
to
the
beer
on
the
whole
its
softer
and
loftier
than
the
urbock
but
not
as
light
as
the
lager
both
worth
your
6
an
acquired
taste
perhaps
but
one
which
is
worth
acquiring
you
cannot
go
wrong
this
is
by
far
one
of
the
most
unique
beers
ive
ever
tried
i
really
wanted
to
like
it
but
i
couldnt
again
its
not
you
baby
its
me
the
beer
pours
a
hazy
reddish
brown
color
with
a
tan
head
the
aroma
is
very
smokey
with
some
meaty
notes
i
also
get
a
little
dark
fruit
in
the
aroma
the
flavor
is
smoke
roasted
malt
chocolate
dark
fruit
and
ash
medium
mouthfeel
and
medium
carbonation
this
beer
was
similar
to
the
urbock
but
i
feel
this
one
was
a
little
less
smoky
but
also
more
complex
in
the
flavor
department
dark
murky
brownishred
swamp
color
in
body
with
floating
offwhite
fluffy
head
aroma
of
ham
meats
woodchips
smoke
tobacco
spice
and
black
pepper
more
subtle
in
flavor
than
it
looks
ham
meats
smokiness
slight
tobacco
towards
the
finish
bacon
hops
without
the
bitterness
towards
the
finish
as
well
medium
in
body
with
a
rather
refreshing
mouthfeel
and
taste
a
tasty
brew
that
quenches
a
strange
thirst
for
a
cigarette
with
your
bacon
and
eggs
overall
this
is
a
beer
that
scares
people
i
was
and
had
some
preconceptions
from
a
tasting
decades
ago
this
smells
harsher
than
it
is
and
it
is
a
far
cry
from
liquid
bacon
great
balance
allows
for
the
drinkability
might
be
tough
to
do
more
than
one
at
a
sitting
but
this
is
very
special
beer
worth
the
try
by
far
pleasant
and
unusual
one
thing
i
will
say
is
that
the
smokey
flavor
tastes
more
authentic
than
i
have
had
in
american
beers
so
they
probably
did
this
right
very
drinkable
and
goes
down
smooth
this
is
a
well
constructed
beer
that
is
true
to
style
im
not
normally
into
smoke
flavors
in
my
beer
but
i
would
definitely
buy
this
again
it
would
be
hard
to
find
something
about
this
beer
that
i
dont
like
other
than
the
fact
its
not
sold
in
six
packs
near
me
a
truly
fine
beer
d
a
great
introduction
to
rauchbier
but
falls
short
of
the
urbock
this
is
a
very
special
and
unique
beer
the
enjoyment
of
this
beer
depends
on
what
you
drank
before
it
what
you
are
eating
to
accompany
it
and
what
your
mood
is
i
was
not
in
the
most
adventurous
mood
so
i
could
not
enjoy
it
as
much
as
i
did
before
still
overall
good
beer
highly
recommended
d
first
time
i
had
this
beer
about
3
years
ago
i
couldnt
finish
it
palette
has
luckily
changed
for
the
better
will
be
trying
their
other
versions
this
is
an
amazing
beer
a
whole
new
world
of
flavor
for
me
a
definite
gouda
cheese
accompaniment
might
also
consider
using
this
in
a
chili
or
black
bean
dish
great
experience
real
easy
to
drink
would
buy
this
again
would
suggest
it
to
someone
to
introduce
them
to
rauchbier
overall
i
feel
like
this
beer
was
a
brand
new
experience
for
me
i
loved
it
d
well
i
couldnt
say
that
i
could
toss
back
a
whole
lot
of
this
beer
but
i
would
enjoy
a
pint
or
two
especially
with
some
bbq
meat
very
good
id
like
to
try
others
of
the
style
but
id
definitely
go
for
more
american
craft
brews
before
this
one
a
unique
style
of
beer
but
definitely
not
my
favorite
mouthfeel
is
light
and
medially
carbonated
drinkability
is
good
because
of
its
light
body
but
i
cant
help
relating
the
taste
and
smell
to
leather
oh
well
give
this
beer
a
try
if
you
have
the
chance
pretty
smoky
but
i
guess
thats
the
style
would
love
to
have
this
next
to
a
nice
chili
or
even
in
it
hard
to
imagine
drinking
pints
of
it
though
the
smokiness
would
just
be
too
much
d
went
down
like
water
smoky
thick
delicious
water
best
smoky
beer
and
smokiest
ive
ever
had
and
im
sad
being
an
ocean
away
from
having
it
on
tap
overall
outstanding
this
is
the
classic
rauchbier
this
is
especially
enjoyable
after
trying
a
good
bock
or
doppelbock
to
put
the
difference
into
perspective
or
paired
with
bacon
or
beef
d
this
beer
was
very
easy
to
drink
the
aroma
and
taste
are
intriguing
by
themselves
but
i
could
definitely
see
paring
this
up
with
german
food
landjäger
immediately
comes
to
mind
or
barbeque
da
good
beer
but
the
style
is
not
among
may
favorite
and
while
it
good
to
enjoy
one
on
occasion
there
no
way
i
could
drink
this
all
night
im
a
big
of
fan
of
darkerlooking
beers
and
this
beer
is
almost
perfect
in
that
respect
leaves
a
nice
thick
head
too
unfortunately
the
flavor
wasnt
quite
as
thick
and
rich
as
i
was
expecting
i
dont
think
anything
on
earth
could
live
up
to
that
smell
its
still
pretty
delicious
and
hearty
though
ill
probably
buy
a
few
other
aecht
beers
if
only
to
smell
them
i
paired
this
with
an
aged
gouda
i
think
it
worked
well
d
certainly
a
beer
for
a
barbequemeat
dish
i
remember
having
this
beer
a
few
years
ago
and
being
completely
overwhelmed
by
the
smoke
this
time
around
i
can
appreciate
the
smoke
while
noting
the
underlying
marzen
malt
flavours
making
the
beer
much
more
accessible
and
not
all
about
one
flavour
lovely
stuff
d
i
wasnt
too
excited
about
drinking
this
as
its
not
really
my
favorite
style
however
this
really
grew
on
me
the
more
i
drank
of
it
a
very
drinkable
beer
it
could
certainly
be
considered
a
session
beer
none
of
the
flavors
are
ever
overwhelmingly
strong
so
its
really
a
pleasure
to
drink
that
said
youve
gotta
like
the
taste
of
smoked
meats
to
get
into
this
cheers
to
the
lcbo
for
actually
importing
something
interesting
i
cant
see
too
many
people
enjoying
this
one
but
im
loving
it
i
dont
know
if
id
ever
want
to
session
this
but
id
be
happy
to
drink
it
regularly
it
i
would
love
to
pair
this
up
with
some
grilled
brats
and
burgers
the
ontap
experience
is
worth
to
travel
to
bamberg
while
great
by
itself
would
be
an
obvious
pairing
for
all
manner
of
meats
bbqd
smoked
or
otherwise

i
could
drink
this
beer
next
to
a
campfire
all
night
the
best
of
its
style
thus
far
along
my
smoked
beer
journey
it
has
everything
that
a
smoked
beer
should
have
a
true
must
try
for
those
who
have
not
tried
it
before
dark
copperbrown
color
with
ruby
highlighting
pretty
thin
light
tan
head
but
it
does
have
some
staying
power
lots
of
smokiness
in
the
aroma
reminded
me
of
a
strong
smoked
cheese
and
smoked
salmon
smoke
dominates
the
flavor
as
well
has
some
bitterness
in
the
finish
but
im
really
having
trouble
discerning
much
beyond
the
smokiness
this
stuff
is
super
smooth
and
goes
down
very
easy
i
wish
id
have
drank
this
with
my
philly
sandwich
i
had
for
lunch
im
generally
not
much
for
beer
with
food
but
i
think
this
would
be
perfect
with
the
right
meal
pours
a
dark
molasses
brown
color
with
some
moderate
tan
head
that
fades
rapidly
bubbles
a
little
seems
carbonated
like
a
soda
smell
is
huge
as
soon
the
bottle
is
opened
at
first
its
almost
all
smoke
like
smoked
pork
or
bacon
rolls
into
some
darker
malts
but
still
big
smoke
taste
follows
with
some
smokeiness
and
chocolate
malt
very
interesting
ive
never
really
had
anything
like
this
and
i
really
like
it
the
smoke
is
big
though
not
overpowering
the
rye
toastroasted
malts
come
come
through
as
it
warms
big
flavors
really
good
mf
is
a
bit
thin
though
not
overcarbonated
as
i
expected
great
drinkability
very
smooth
and
interesting
great
beer
pours
a
murky
chocolate
color
with
a
one
finger
tan
head
boom
that
smell
hits
ya
right
away
im
reminded
of
my
summer
quests
involving
over
smoked
venison
meat
haha
beef
jerky
strong
hickory
it
says
beechwood
on
the
bottle
but
it
smells
just
like
hickory
to
me
leather
sausage
pepper
tons
of
spices
and
clove
oddly
appealing
to
me
like
picking
up
a
dirty
shirt
and
smelling
it
twice
thankfully
the
taste
is
not
as
strong
as
the
aroma
smoke
on
the
water
light
malty
and
slightly
sweet
bbq
beer
for
sure
unique
and
cool
i
wouldnt
call
this
one
a
sipper
more
like
a
sniffer
ha
get
this
one
if
you
see
it
served
with
a
sticky
fluffy
head
of
two
fingers
tanned
over
a
mahogany
body
not
much
lace
nose
is
strongly
baconlike
with
notes
of
open
flame
and
burned
wood
slight
sweetness
in
the
flavor
thats
not
present
in
the
nose
some
roasted
barley
in
there
the
rest
of
the
flavor
is
heavily
smoked
lightly
bitter
herbal
hopping
component
is
also
noted
light
body
with
high
carbonation
not
so
easy
to
drink
due
to
the
unusual
nature
of
the
beer
but
a
solid
drink
for
when
youre
in
the
mood
for
a
supersmoky
sip
very
drinkablei
recommend
this
one
before
a
meatlovers
pizza
or
some
german
sausage
excellent
beer
happy
mardi
gras
notes
i
really
liked
the
smoked
meat
aspect
of
this
beer
but
it
seems
like
that
would
be
a
bit
more
subject
on
the
person
i
could
see
this
going
well
in
the
summer
with
a
barbecue
or
just
some
meat
in
general
overall
this
rauchbier
delivers
if
youre
looking
for
a
smoked
marzen
then
look
no
further
this
brewery
hits
the
nail
on
the
head
in
terms
of
staying
true
to
the
style
definitely
give
it
a
try
if
youre
at
all
interested
in
this
type
of
beer
overall
this
brew
is
a
contender
for
best
in
class
plus
it
goes
great
within
bbq
mouthfeel
is
nice
although
the
brew
is
not
quite
as
thick
as
the
smell
might
lead
one
to
believe
nice
overall
combination
of
carbonation
and
smoothness
drinkability
is
excellent
a
great
late
morningearly
afternoon
hearty
smoke
bomb
something
to
drink
by
the
fire
d
i
wouldnt
be
able
to
drink
this
unless
im
in
the
mood
for
it
as
a
breakfast
beer
paired
with
the
obvious
bacon
i
could
see
this
being
even
better
all
in
all
it
tastes
good
and
if
you
like
or
want
to
try
out
a
smoked
beer
this
is
the
one
d
this
one
really
challenges
the
senses
its
an
enjoying
offering
and
one
that
im
happy
i
tried
but
im
not
sure
its
repeatable
or
one
that
i
would
seek
out
purposefully
seek
out
in
the
future
looks
like
a
beautiful
marzen
dark
amber
color
and
a
large
white
head
the
head
quickly
collars
and
dies
smells
like
a
hickory
tree
campfire
tastes
like
a
rich
and
malty
marzen
with
mesquite
bbq
flavors
i
love
this
beer
poured
into
a
wheat
type
glass
dark
mahogany
with
light
tan
head
the
hangs
around
very
slowly
disapates
laces
somewhat
that
great
smokey
aroma
masks
any
others
that
might
be
present
this
was
the
best
of
the
three
rauchbiers
aecht
offers
here
as
much
as
i
loved
the
bock
i
thought
this
was
a
better
melding
of
smoke
and
flavors
if
you
are
only
going
to
sample
one
of
these
make
sure
it
is
this
one
taste
is
of
smoke
smoke
smoke
malt
wood
oily
feel
each
taste
is
a
little
better
than
the
last
it
is
shocking
at
first
and
then
as
your
tastebuds
form
to
the
unique
taste
it
mellows
out
and
is
quite
pleasant
feel
and
drinkability
light
leaning
towards
mediumlight
in
body
much
lighter
than
what
the
color
would
leave
you
to
believe
spritzy
carbonation
for
something
that
youd
not
thing
to
have
higher
and
spritzy
carbonation
feels
great
in
the
mouth
levels
of
the
carbonation
are
in
agreement
with
the
weight
of
the
body
it
all
works
very
nice
definitely
something
to
check
out
i
was
once
at
a
fancy
shmantsy
indian
restaurant
and
ordered
a
curried
lamb
shank
the
waiter
suggested
a
smoked
shiraz
from
india
to
pair
it
with
at
first
i
was
put
off
not
knowing
much
about
smoked
drinks
at
the
time
and
it
turned
out
to
be
perfect
thats
something
id
like
to
try
this
with
the
sweetness
of
this
beer
and
i
loves
me
sweet
beers
needs
to
be
balanced
with
something
spicy
i
think
or
maybe
some
intense
german
food
like
a
good
bratwurst
with
spicy
saurkraut
just
thinking
d
tasty
goes
down
easily
not
too
filling
mild
kick
very
good
representation
of
style
to
me
this
style
is
something
you
have
to
really
be
in
the
mood
for
or
have
a
good
food
pairing
to
go
with
it
but
this
beer
is
the
one
that
youd
want
to
go
for
at
that
time
dgreat
beer
this
is
a
classic
smoked
beer
not
overly
smoky
at
all
i
would
have
this
beer
again
drinkability
enjoyable
i
will
be
drinking
more
of
these
as
it
stands
im
cooking
pulledpork
sandwiches
tonight
so
im
adding
some
of
this
to
the
cooking
pot
to
spice
it
up
d
the
classic
of
the
style
and
the
beer
to
have
if
you
want
to
now
what
rauchbier
is
all
about
a
throwback
to
the
early
lagers
and
one
of
the
most
traditional
flavours
youre
going
to
get
will
definitely
be
buying
again
the
color
of
a
persian
sunset
over
the
elburz
mountains
the
smell
of
that
alder
smoked
grain
punishing
the
room
like
my
kitchen
at
8
with
the
best
bacon
around
i
want
this
beer
for
breakfast
i
guess
i
just
want
this
beer
not
to
be
gone
if
you
are
worried
about
drinking
liquid
bbq
saucefear
not
this
brew
is
an
amazing
balance
of
perfect
execution
malt
carbonation
yeast
and
smoke
all
play
a
dominant
role
yet
all
work
together
what
an
amazing
and
traditional
brew
i
now
must
find
the
urbock
i
love
this
beer
all
those
sharp
flavors
combine
in
an
enjoyable
assault
on
the
taste
buds
and
the
nose
kicks
ass
pours
a
clear
ruby
brown
with
a
fluffy
slightly
offwhite
head
that
leaves
a
heavy
residual
head
that
allows
heavy
lacing
down
the
glass
aroma
is
smoke
roast
salty
bacon
flavor
is
sweet
toasty
malt
forward
with
smoke
and
salt
and
a
sweet
finish
slightly
bready
mediumfull
bodied
with
a
moderate
amount
of
carbonation
considering
the
smoke
character
this
beer
is
highly
drinkable
and
well
engineered
well
done
smoked
and
not
as
overthetop
as
a
fresh
alaskan
smoked
porter
d
good
drinkability
if
you
can
handle
the
strong
smokey
smell
and
flavor
d
very
complementary
to
certain
foods
and
extremely
delicious
as
a
standalone
i
only
gave
the
drinkablilty
a
3
5
considering
i
couldnt
drink
much
of
it
one
bottle
was
just
about
right
but
i
would
definately
drink
it
again
d
definitely
a
smoked
beer
almost
so
over
the
top
that
it
becomes
a
novelty
something
id
come
back
to
sometime
down
the
road
but
not
for
a
while
i
was
really
looking
forward
to
this
one
after
reading
the
reviews
in
short
a
must
try
but
i
couldnt
drink
more
than
one
it
poured
a
beautiful
dark
amber
with
a
2
inch
creamy
head
it
smelled
of
smoke
like
others
have
said
imagine
the
smell
of
a
bbq
the
taste
was
ok
very
unique
it
wasnt
bad
but
it
wasnt
incredible
either
the
aftertaste
is
what
turned
me
off
it
really
left
a
taste
of
smoke
in
my
mouth
that
i
couldnt
help
but
associate
with
a
tailgate
hours
later
i
still
tasted
it
overall
this
is
a
must
try
at
least
once
beer
i
remember
this
beer
being
awesome
from
the
gravity
feed
barrels
at
the
brewery
in
bamberg
i
still
enjoy
it
but
needs
to
be
paired
with
some
robust
food
only
had
one
or
two
other
rauchbiers
but
this
one
was
great
and
really
makes
me
want
to
explore
this
category
more
this
beer
is
drinkabile
despite
its
intense
smell
the
dry
finish
doesnt
linger
this
is
a
very
smooth
beer
to
drink
not
too
much
carbonation
medium
bodied
the
sweetness
of
this
beer
comes
through
more
as
it
warms
i
would
buy
this
again
god
i
love
these
beers
if
you
like
things
smoked
cheese
salmon
ribs
bbq
sauce
etc
you
cant
go
past
this
mind
you
it
isnt
some
kind
of
novelty
beer
this
has
structure
balance
and
flavour
in
spades
beautiful
smokey
tar
coffee
on
the
nose
with
a
very
pleasant
dry
charcoallike
presence
on
the
palate
enjoyed
this
with
a
rump
steak
with
wild
mmushrooms
and
peppercorns
and
it
rocked
the
house
d
goes
down
very
smooth
for
me
might
be
a
tad
rich
to
have
too
many
d
good
to
have
one
drink
but
more
than
one
is
a
little
bit
pushy
because
you
feel
like
you
ate
more
than
a
pound
of
bacon
not
bad
at
all
i
am
just
not
a
huge
fan
of
rauchbiers
i
guess
i
really
appreciate
the
craft
that
goes
into
a
beer
like
this
though
i
prefer
the
smoke
flavor
to
compliment
the
malt
not
the
other
way
around
if
you
like
the
style
or
interested
in
any
way
this
is
the
place
to
start
mfd
medium
bodied
and
smooth
my
clear
cut
favorite
from
aecht
schlenkerla
give
it
a
try
the
weird
thing
i
love
grilling
bacon
sausage
just
not
as
part
of
my
beer
who
knows
maybe
ill
try
this
again
when
my
palate
is
more
developed
heaven
knows
sn
porter
and
stout
were
tough
for
me
10
years
ago
now
i
love
them
at
the
same
time
there
is
none
of
that
ale
staleness
but
a
crisp
refreshingness
mixed
with
sweet
malt
flavours
outstanding
final
thoughts
certainly
a
good
experience
and
i
would
recommend
trying
it
at
least
once
if
i
wanted
something
odd
id
buy
it
again
sure
really
though
there
isnt
much
id
pair
this
beer
with
and
seems
to
be
more
of
a
novelty
then
anything
try
it
its
certainly
different
from
my
experience
about
half
a
dozen
different
smoked
beers
i
could
barely
finish
a
glass
of
rauchbier
but
ill
have
no
problem
going
trough
this
500ml
bottle
amazing
this
is
an
extraordinarily
unique
beer
style
that
ive
never
had
before
ive
heard
that
people
generally
either
really
hate
it
or
love
it
and
i
definitely
love
it
i
couldnt
drink
too
many
of
these
in
a
row
though
because
of
the
strong
smokiness
this
is
a
great
sipping
beer
thanks
bobsy
for
another
great
beer
to
be
honest
i
hate
this
style
and
didnt
like
this
beer
but
i
did
it
because
its
always
good
to
be
open
based
on
the
reviews
and
comments
on
other
rauchbiers
this
is
exactly
what
they
taste
like
and
is
a
good
reproduction
so
this
is
probably
the
best
rauch
ive
ever
had
and
i
may
be
coming
around
on
this
style
and
these
beers
because
i
finished
it
and
i
understood
it
i
still
didnt
rank
it
as
high
as
most
but
i
think
im
beginning
to
understand
the
general
appeal
pours
a
very
dark
brown
no
head
minimal
lacing
oily
surface
smell
is
pure
smoke
smells
like
charcoal
plus
good
pork
bbq
front
is
puuure
smoked
bacon
back
doesnt
taste
much
different
than
the
front
very
nice
mouthfeel
not
thick
but
substantial
overall
really
good
if
you
can
get
it
and
love
pork
d
excellent
for
sipping
the
taste
is
too
strong
for
more
than
one
the
complex
smokiness
the
malty
sweetness
and
the
relatively
light
lager
character
creates
a
wonderful
mélange
that
makes
for
a
very
drinkable
and
moderately
complex
beer
i
imagine
that
i
could
easily
quaff
a
couple
of
pints
of
this
beer
one
after
another
much
more
drinkable
than
the
bottled
version
this
one
is
fairly
complex
and
definitely
unique
if
youre
going
to
try
a
rauchbier
it
has
to
be
one
from
bamberg
d
i
cant
really
do
this
maybe
its
an
acquired
taste
maybe
ill
acquire
it
but
for
now
i
like
my
meat
on
a
plate
the
taste
is
light
for
a
rauch
its
smokey
and
porky
but
there
are
some
definite
malts
there
with
a
little
sweetness
the
sweetness
to
some
might
make
it
more
drinkable
but
to
me
its
distracting
from
what
i
really
want
which
is
hardcore
smokiness
nice
chestnut
browncoppery
color
low
aromaslight
smokey
quality
trace
of
a
caramelnutty
note
malty
flavor
with
a
nice
moderate
level
of
smoke
touch
of
hop
bitterness
to
go
with
it
good
body
for
a
maerzen
very
drinkable
beer
my
german
friend
tries
to
scare
me
off
of
the
smoke
beers
as
he
hates
them
i
find
this
quite
enjoyable
d
this
was
the
perfect
beer
for
sitting
out
on
my
deck
watching
the
leaves
fall
awesome
beer
for
this
time
of
year
and
ill
definitely
pick
some
up
the
next
time
im
going
camping
d
i
think
i
really
need
to
move
to
bamberg
germany
rauchbiers
are
one
of
my
favorite
beers
and
aecht
schlenkerla
is
the
brewery
that
all
other
rauchbiers
should
be
judged
by
i
could
seriously
drink
this
stuff
all
day
and
all
night
a
must
try
o
excellent
beer
excellent
drinkability
thats
what
you
can
expect
from
an
aecht
schlenkerla
i
want
to
thank
my
friend
jim
for
giving
me
this
beer
as
this
was
a
great
and
unique
brew
that
i
could
enjoy
once
or
twice
a
year
this
beer
is
not
for
everyone
but
for
the
adventurous
beer
drinker
this
is
a
must
try
beer
as
it
was
so
aromatic
that
it
almost
overwhelms
the
senses
but
the
flavor
is
very
good
and
not
nearly
as
dramatic
as
the
smell
a
very
good
beer
which
is
a
nice
one
to
sip
and
savor
i
can
imagine
this
going
quite
well
with
some
bread
and
cheese
overall
this
is
an
excellent
beer
especially
for
drinking
in
the
fall
and
cooler
months
im
gonna
run
down
to
the
store
first
thing
tomorrow
and
a
grab
a
few
more
of
these
highly
recommend
the
best
rauchbier
ive
tasted
you
certainly
have
to
be
in
the
mood
for
one
of
these
but
when
that
time
comes
this
is
the
most
delicious
not
to
mention
drinkable
of
the
lot
perfect
for
the
autumn
season
i
hate
to
slam
a
beer
but
this
was
amazingly
bad
ive
had
a
smoked
porter
before
and
didnt
like
that
either
but
this
was
far
worse
my
wife
said
it
smells
like
bandaids
and
she
has
a
point
this
beer
smells
smoky
obviously
and
at
the
same
time
medicinal
for
me
it
was
like
someone
scooped
up
the
coals
of
a
burned
down
building
and
made
a
tea
out
of
them
by
steeping
them
in
beer
truly
awful
d
despite
all
its
merits
i
simply
dont
see
myself
drinking
this
beer
more
than
once
a
season
its
a
terrific
flavour
to
be
sure
but
rarely
one
im
looking
for
in
my
glass
well
worth
the
experience
however
and
certainly
one
id
recommend
for
one
up
to
the
challenge
mouthfeel
is
light
to
medium
bodied
with
low
to
medium
carbonation
perfect
body
glad
ive
started
to
like
rauchs
again
because
they
are
great
truly
a
unique
delicious
musttry
beer
experience
notes
give
smoked
beer
a
shot
at
least
once
its
very
unique
and
if
you
are
looking
for
something
different
this
is
a
great
place
to
look
this
beer
has
evoked
words
such
as
meat
wood
jerky
etc
aecht
schlenkerla
marzen
is
an
earthy
and
hearty
beer
and
probably
the
best
of
the
rauchbiers
this
one
is
worth
it
d
again
i
know
ill
have
to
come
back
to
this
once
ive
tried
more
rauchs
but
definitely
tasty
and
sessionable
going
great
with
my
extra
sharp
cheddar
mac
and
cheese
a
very
good
rauchbier
this
style
isnt
for
everyone
but
the
well
controlled
smoke
character
in
this
example
make
it
a
quite
drinkable
version
this
beer
is
an
aquired
tast
but
very
damn
good
and
tasty
i
would
drink
one
of
these
and
move
to
another
but
not
for
a
bad
reason
this
is
a
great
brew
that
is
meant
to
be
sipped
and
enjoyed
nice
if
you
like
the
rauchbier
style
this
is
your
brew
very
smoky
hints
of
smoked
ham
or
bacon
found
in
the
aroma
translating
into
a
very
smoky
flavor
that
is
well
balanced
with
the
malts
not
much
hoppiness
to
speak
of
very
drinkable
since
the
smoke
flavor
isnt
overbearing
im
a
fan
had
a
halfliter
bottle
with
my
burger
at
the
farmhouse
in
emmaus
pa
i
remembered
this
beer
being
supersmokey
and
i
was
not
mistaken
its
not
like
most
american
smoke
beers
however
that
drink
like
liquid
bacon
not
that
thats
a
bad
thing
this
flavor
is
rich
with
smoked
wood
flavor
more
in
line
with
what
you
get
in
homemade
jerkey
its
a
big
but
smooth
roasted
taste
that
reminds
you
of
a
fireplace
the
malt
provide
sweet
crust
and
caramel
background
but
mostly
just
props
up
the
smoked
beechwood
the
body
despite
the
strong
flavor
is
very
drinkable
overall
this
is
a
classic
rauchbier
dark
brown
with
a
thin
beige
head
with
good
retention
and
nice
lace
on
the
nose
its
deep
and
roasty
meaty
and
savory
almost
sausagelike
mild
caramel
sweetness
is
present
the
palate
opens
smoky
in
a
way
that
reminds
me
of
smoking
wet
wood
with
an
earthy
hop
character
the
hops
work
very
well
with
the
smoke
enhancing
the
experience
smoky
and
meaty
this
stuff
is
great
light
in
body
and
the
carbonation
is
a
touch
higher
than
it
needs
to
be
the
finish
is
solid
dry
and
smoky
but
could
use
a
little
bit
more
character
thoroughly
enjoyable
this
beer
is
pretty
excellent
d
while
i
do
enjoy
this
the
taste
is
a
little
too
strong
to
take
repeatedly
d
not
bad
for
a
smoky
hammyass
beer
this
is
a
novelty
for
sure
but
overall
i
like
it
pours
a
clear
dark
brown
with
ruby
highlights
and
a
creamy
beige
head
that
recedes
to
a
cap
but
sticks
around
forever
smells
like
a
brisket
thats
been
smoking
away
for
14
hours
well
actually
it
smells
more
like
the
smoke
than
the
brisket
i
strain
and
maybe
think
i
find
some
caramel
or
toffee
underneath
but
the
smoke
is
powerful
and
hides
anything
else
that
is
in
there
i
now
understand
why
some
people
say
smoked
smells
like
bacon
the
taste
is
rich
malty
and
creamy
with
a
heavy
hand
of
smoke
there
are
some
sweet
malts
in
there
caramel
toffee
and
maybe
some
brown
sugar
in
the
taste
lightly
carbonated
medium
body
i
would
have
to
say
this
must
be
an
acquired
taste
i
can
appreciate
it
for
what
it
is
but
i
cant
imagine
myself
enjoying
many
of
these
i
think
its
very
well
done
but
not
for
me
this
is
the
second
smoked
beer
i
have
had
and
it
was
much
better
than
the
first
stone
smoked
porter
has
a
rich
amber
color
and
smells
like
a
barbeque
has
some
serious
drinkability
but
at
the
same
time
could
not
see
myself
drinking
more
than
two
of
these
16
ozers
even
though
its
the
2nd
smoked
beer
i
have
head
you
can
just
tell
that
just
among
the
best
i
was
very
surprised
by
this
one
and
highly
recommend
this
one
for
curious
drinkers
this
is
a
beer
everyone
should
try
very
peculiar
id
probably
buy
one
or
2
again
in
the
future
just
for
somthing
diffrent
but
this
is
definitly
not
my
favorite
style
pours
a
dark
brown
with
a
thin
tan
head
nose
has
beige
head
nose
has
big
smoke
presence
over
crisp
malts
toffee
and
caramel
taste
also
quite
smokey
yet
still
well
balanced
clean
body
is
quite
refreshing
im
really
starting
to
enjoy
this
style
and
these
guys
do
a
great
job
sat
on
the
patio
with
the
cantankerous
for
this
one
and
watched
the
birds
playing
in
the
woods
behind
our
house
the
smell
of
the
aecht
schlenkerla
was
especially
pleasing
surprised
by
how
much
i
liked
this
this
beer
was
poured
into
a
pint
glass
as
the
coloration
is
that
of
deep
brown
color
it
is
actually
a
good
deep
red
tone
to
it
as
well
the
smell
of
smoke
aroma
is
the
over
tones
of
smell
it
reminds
me
of
meet
curing
to
be
jerked
the
taste
is
that
of
smoke
and
nice
deep
caramel
tones
as
well
makes
me
want
to
try
more
smoked
beers
pours
a
very
dark
amber
with
2
finger
head
of
barely
offwhite
foam
leaves
quite
a
bit
of
lacing
on
the
glass
as
soon
as
you
crack
this
beast
open
you
know
you
are
dealing
with
something
a
little
different
you
dont
even
have
to
breath
through
your
nose
and
you
can
easily
pick
up
on
the
smokiness
in
the
nose
i
cant
fight
my
way
through
it
all
i
smell
is
delicious
smokey
nay
very
smokey
bacon
taking
a
sip
i
am
immediately
thinking
of
a
delicous
roast
beef
dinner
with
gravy
what
the
hell
is
this
dinner
in
a
bottle
finish
is
a
little
bitter
but
the
smoke
remains
in
your
mouth
long
after
you
have
taken
a
sip
another
noticable
feature
is
a
bit
of
a
metallic
taste
the
bottle
is
labled
as
a
marzen
but
you
could
easily
lie
to
me
and
tell
me
it
is
something
else
i
guess
if
you
took
away
the
smokey
flavor
it
might
taste
like
a
marzen
but
i
am
too
caught
up
in
the
beefy
taste
to
tell
what
it
is
about
all
this
beer
has
to
offer
that
is
like
a
marzen
is
the
color
and
even
that
looks
like
it
has
been
set
on
fire
and
burnt
a
little
my
first
experience
was
an
explosion
of
dark
wheat
colored
thick
foam
all
over
a
mess
the
color
was
a
beautiful
mahogany
amber
with
cola
highlights
the
smell
was
very
dominate
smoked
or
even
burnt
wood
aroma
maybe
cedar
with
a
slight
chocolate
accent
and
other
potent
spices
the
taste
was
the
same
as
the
smell
mouthfeel
deep
mediumbodied
and
smooth
drinkability
it
was
real
good
but
the
smokiness
was
a
little
overpowering
this
is
a
unique
beer
that
every
ba
should
try
at
least
once
one
of
a
kind
beer
that
is
well
worth
the
high
price
makes
me
remember
why
i
so
enjoyed
living
in
germany
for
four
years
d
im
still
developing
a
palate
for
this
style
but
i
really
liked
this
beer
i
cant
say
that
id
be
able
to
put
away
several
pints
at
a
sitting
but
paired
with
the
right
smokyspicy
foods
this
beer
provides
a
unique
drinking
experience
d
moderately
high
the
smoke
can
get
to
you
but
for
me
i
fing
love
this
beer
in
my
opinion
this
is
a
unique
fantastic
and
oneofakind
beer
that
is
prefect
for
stretching
your
concepts
of
what
a
beer
can
be
although
its
an
oldworld
technique
this
beer
can
hold
its
own
and
even
teach
a
thing
or
two
to
modern
brewers
fanfingtastic
my
passion
for
this
beer
is
almost
unrivaled
one
of
the
best
beers
ive
ever
had
recommend
it
great
for
the
style
but
not
everyday
as
for
mouthfeel
it
is
light
and
fairly
smooth
but
i
can
practically
sense
the
carcinogens
suspended
in
this
as
i
swallow
needless
to
say
drinkability
suffers
because
of
the
offputting
flavors
definitely
a
unique
experience
and
surely
an
acquired
taste
one
i
cant
really
see
myself
trying
to
hard
to
develop
not
my
favorite
beer
but
fits
the
style
well
and
will
make
fans
of
this
style
very
happy
dont
think
you
would
throw
back
more
than
one
of
these
per
night
though
fun
to
try
i
really
enjoy
various
amounts
of
smoke
in
a
beer
this
one
has
the
most
of
any
that
ive
had
and
i
like
it
this
is
one
of
those
beers
that
i
like
but
wouldnt
want
every
day
like
sculpin
but
once
every
two
weeks
would
be
pleasant
overall
an
interesting
and
complex
beer
that
i
think
every
beer
fan
should
try
at
least
once
to
see
if
they
like
it
i
would
drink
another
if
given
the
opportunity
overall
im
surprised
im
not
a
fan
of
smokiness
and
yet
i
kind
of
really
dig
this
beer
huh
very
drinkable
if
the
smell
doesnt
bother
you
you
can
out
down
many
of
these
a
unique
style
definietly
worth
trying
mouthfeel
is
crisp
with
a
moderate
amount
of
carbonation
present
flavor
is
smoke
smoke
meat
smoke
smoked
meat
slight
bitter
hops
and
smoke
wow
i
was
a
little
hesitant
going
into
this
one
but
i
dig
it
i
wouldnt
want
to
drink
one
after
the
other
as
it
is
a
bit
different
but
i
can
drink
this
one
plenty
fine
smoked
bbq
does
not
do
much
for
rauchbiers
as
i
first
imagined
i
have
found
chili
to
be
really
tasty
with
it
though
would
go
well
with
grilled
or
spicy
foods
i
couldnt
drink
more
than
one
in
a
sitting
though
definitely
something
different
and
worth
a
try
dont
know
what
took
me
so
long
to
try
this
beer
i
think
other
smoke
beers
i
have
tried
were
not
nearly
this
good
so
i
wasnt
interested
i
highly
recommend
this
one
and
i
will
be
having
it
again
soon
the
smoke
is
really
light
and
not
overpowering
the
sweetness
is
upfront
reminds
me
of
bbq
spicy
and
very
complex
in
the
middle
the
malt
is
thick
and
rich
lightly
hopped
finishes
clean
not
grainy
sweetness
is
on
the
tip
of
the
tongue
and
extremely
dry
throughout
taste
lingers
until
the
next
sip
i
see
why
dad
loves
this
he
was
based
in
bamberg
in
the
50s
and
60s
the
bier
garden
is
the
place
to
try
this
if
you
are
ever
in
bamberg
50cl
bottle
into
a
half
maß
a
joy
to
drink
but
not
all
the
time
d
goes
down
very
smooth
the
smoke
does
not
seem
to
negatively
affect
drinkability
in
fact
this
would
be
amazing
paired
with
some
smoked
sausages
or
ribs
when
i
first
had
this
beer
as
a
teenager
i
was
utterly
horrified
that
a
beer
could
be
smoked
then
again
i
didnt
know
german
at
that
age
so
rauchbier
was
inaptly
translated
as
somethingorotherbeer
but
now
i
knew
what
was
coming
and
i
can
say
that
i
love
it
aecht
schlenkerla
rauchbier
marzen
is
a
great
experience
however
a
little
goes
a
long
way
im
glad
i
tried
it
however
i
may
not
go
back
for
more
this
beer
poured
a
dark
amberbrown
with
a
head
that
was
generous
but
lighter
in
color
than
anticipated
aroma
is
of
smokebacon
taste
is
the
same
mouthfeel
is
very
nice
i
like
this
the
best
of
the
schlenkerla
smoke
beers
still
this
is
not
something
i
could
session
on
a
regular
basis
the
taste
ehh
not
so
much
its
too
thin
if
this
was
an
ale
and
not
a
lager
i
think
i
would
like
it
better
but
al
i
taste
is
smoke
no
malt
and
the
mouthfeel
is
too
thin
good
well
made
beer
but
not
my
cup
of
tea
this
beer
pours
a
deep
brown
with
a
lot
of
red
highlights
to
it
almost
amber
in
color
but
too
deep
to
really
be
amber
a
two
finger
of
tan
head
that
recedes
to
a
nice
14
cap
nice
lacing
left
behind
nose
is
reminiscent
of
a
campfire
ok
campfire
and
bacon
i
was
practically
salivating
at
this
point
taste
is
if
i
could
bottle
a
campfire
this
is
exactly
what
i
would
think
it
tasted
like
deeply
smoked
malts
are
the
basis
of
this
beer
start
to
finish
with
saltiness
to
the
taste
reminds
me
of
smoked
bacons
and
hams
nice
mouthfeel
rather
creamy
mildly
carbonated
this
is
a
beer
that
i
could
drink
for
a
good
session
its
not
everyones
cup
of
tea
but
its
a
damn
fine
beer
for
me
and
also
compared
to
the
urbock
it
has
a
more
mild
taste
to
it
with
more
carbonation
zesty
almost
candy
spice
taste
to
it
wow
what
a
beer
quite
complex
and
layered
while
its
got
the
smoke
down
pat
it
doesnt
stop
there
plenty
to
contemplate
while
you
sip
and
let
the
beer
warm
seriously
enjoyable
pours
dark
brown
color
with
huge
tan
head
retention
is
very
good
smell
very
smoky
malty
quite
nice
taste
smoky
again
some
caramel
sweetness
finishes
slightly
bitter
very
smooth
and
rich
fairly
balanced
quite
drinkable
i
liked
this
one
it
would
make
good
session
beer
d
another
surprise
with
all
that
smoke
it
still
goes
down
nice
and
easy
maybe
couldnt
down
many
of
these
by
themselves
but
with
some
bratwurst
or
some
ribs
hell
yeah
keep
it
comin
the
beer
pours
a
dark
wineish
brown
with
some
nice
lacing
the
aroma
is
wood
smoke
from
a
campfire
with
a
touch
of
smokehouse
pork
however
these
smoke
flavors
dont
entirely
crowd
out
the
solid
malt
backbone
hellertrum
does
an
excellent
job
controlling
the
meaty
potential
of
the
beer
the
flavor
is
similarly
good
and
affords
some
interesting
insight
into
the
historical
practices
of
brewing
its
good
that
german
brewers
maintain
these
older
styles
the
malt
is
sweet
and
lush
with
a
crisp
touch
of
bitterness
in
the
finish
the
beer
has
a
pleasing
mouthfeel
smooth
and
round
drinkability
is
definitely
a
case
of
personal
preference
but
its
not
a
heavy
beer
to
drink
despite
the
depth
of
flavor
d
this
is
a
very
nice
full
flavored
beer
with
some
nice
depth
and
smoke
was
only
one
flavor
of
many
the
bandaid
notes
were
very
soft
and
pleasant
much
more
so
than
beers
with
to
much
peat
smoked
malt
i
would
be
interested
in
trying
to
pair
this
beer
with
food
first
smokebeer
pours
a
deep
red
smells
much
like
a
camp
fire
and
smoked
sausage
the
taste
is
actually
much
more
subtle
you
can
taste
the
malts
and
the
smoke
taste
is
much
more
mild
on
the
palate
it
leaves
a
pretty
great
taste
in
your
mouth
like
chewing
on
a
beef
jerky
great
for
certain
occasions
and
probably
only
have
one
of
these
each
time
overall
this
is
a
well
done
rauchbier
its
not
too
overdone
with
the
smokiness
but
its
still
front
and
center
definitely
worth
a
shot
half
liter
bottle
poured
into
my
dimpled
mug
appears
a
dark
ruby
brown
color
with
an
inch
of
dense
lingering
light
ecru
foam
nose
and
tastes
is
of
a
smokey
campfire
freshly
fried
bacon
seltzers
lebanon
bologna
a
regional
pa
thing
really
comes
to
mind
due
to
the
welcoming
caramel
sweetness
that
creeps
in
from
the
malt
there
is
a
pleasant
spiciness
as
well
reminiscent
of
smoked
peppered
ham
about
a
notch
better
than
medium
bodied
with
ample
carbonation
as
you
aerate
it
in
your
mouth
the
smokiness
appears
it
is
smooth
not
think
pleasent
in
the
mouth
and
interesting
to
drink
and
discuss
very
smooth
the
bacon
flavor

hold
some

2009
outside
temperature
of
70degrees
farenheit
the
pour
is
a
slightly
cloudy
brown
with
a
tremendous
amount
of
foamy
tan
head
that
bubbles
until
the
end
and
never
really
goes
away
the
aroma
is
spectacular
like
nothing
else
i
have
smelled
it
is
like
smoked
cheddar
cheese
malts
and
hops
play
second
fiddle
to
the
amazing
smoky
aroma
the
mouthfeel
is
medoium
to
bold
and
kind
of
creamy
the
taste
is
an
intricate
balance
of
smoked
malts
and
wheat
this
is
probably
the
best
wheat
beer
i
have
ever
had
ive
always
really
liked
the
beer
from
this
brewery
and
i
think
they
set
the
standards
for
rauchbier
for
everyone
else
these
beers
are
international
treasures
and
should
be
appreciated
for
what
they
are
pours
a
slightly
reddish
dark
brown
with
a
very
loosely
beaded
head
that
fades
to
a
ring
absolutely
scrumptious
aroma
of
ethereal
woodsmoke
and
tangy
malt
the
taste
has
plenty
of
that
same
woodsmoke
as
well
as
a
slightly
sour
graininess
and
a
long
bitter
almost
tannic
finish
at
mid
taste
the
malts
are
smooth
and
creamy
quite
lovely
and
very
firm
great
by
itself
but
a
wonderful
food
beer
try
it
with
somke
roast
pork
and
potatos
or
with
some
sharp
cheddar
cheese
overall
a
remarkable
brew
very
happy
i
picked
this
one
up
the
smoked
meats
in
the
nose
really
get
the
salivary
glands
going
nothing
overpowering
and
very
well
balanced
paired
this
with
some
cheddar
cheese
and
man
was
that
ever
good
it
would
be
interesting
having
another
rauchbier
and
compare
the
two
but
unfortunately
this
is
the
only
one
available
in
my
area
atleast
for
the
time
being
dont
be
intimidated
by
the
fact
that
this
is
a
smoked
beer
highly
recommended
bone
white
head
very
thin
with
a
pool
of
large
bubbles
in
the
middle
no
lacing
to
be
had
dark
brown
to
mahogany
red
in
hue
close
to
full
transparency
though
very
consistent
hue
like
duh
the
nose
is
very
smoky
like
a
dry
kindling
fire
crispy
bacon
touch
of
molasses
like
slow
roast
pulled
pork
some
pine
resin
as
well
toasty
sourdough
solid
nuttiness
too
some
grape
to
cherry
fruit
scents
no
citrus
really
light
to
mediumbodied
but
that
smokiness
is
so
bodacious
it
just
fills
the
mouth
bacon
beef
jerky
saltlick
quite
obvious
its
interesting
to
taste
a
liquid
so
woody
yet
with
no
hint
of
oak
barrel
treatment
theres
a
light
bitterness
which
teases
out
a
moment
of
white
grapefruit
conversely
not
without
sweet
notes
of
molasses
honey
and
caramelized
brown
sugar
green
raisin
to
fig
fruit
in
minute
portions
the
finish
swirls
with
persistent
smokiness
it
doesnt
leave
until
you
intentionally
put
something
else
in
your
mouth
to
tame
it
recommended
d
changed
by
mind
the
more
i
drank
as
i
got
more
familiar
with
the
smokey
flavor
this
would
be
a
great
beer
to
drink
if
youre
munching
on
a
snack
tray
d
i
can
tell
you
that
when
fresh
rauchbier
is
highly
drinkable
through
an
evening
of
stubehopping
around
bamberg
ive
never
tried
more
than
one
bottle
in
a
sitting
here
in
the
states
but
i
just
might
soon
dark
brown
clear
liquid
with
an
offwhite
fluffy
head
strong
bacon
smell
covering
everything
but
a
hint
of
woodsiness
the
beef
jerky
taste
just
keeps
coming
upfront
there
is
some
bready
maltiness
but
then
the
jerky
takes
over
and
lingers
in
the
finish
very
intriguing
but
not
as
rich
and
balanced
as
their
fastenbier
very
unique
beer
would
love
to
have
one
of
these
next
time
im
having
pastrami
or
some
good
smoked
barbecue
i
could
drink
this
all
night
so
long
as
i
was
hungry
and
in
the
mood
for
an
exceptionally
tasty
beer
a
nice
light
brown
color
some
ruby
highlights
dark
in
the
middle
fairly
clear
with
a
thin
1cm
head
loose
bubbles
collapses
to
a
thin
swirl
very
little
lacing
looks
about
how
id
expect
smell
is
definitely
is
smoked
very
smoked
but
this
one
is
more
woody
than
the
first
i
tried
and
much
less
meaty
still
some
burnt
pork
like
bbq
but
with
a
distinct
malt
sweetness
underneath
again
a
good
smell
for
a
rauchbeir
though
its
hard
to
look
past
the
fresh
wood
smoke
smell
like
ashes
the
taste
comes
across
first
with
the
woody
smoke
like
eating
smoked
meat
without
the
meat
underneath
definitely
a
very
interesting
taste
but
i
think
this
one
is
much
more
palatable
for
me
than
other
rauchbiers
and
i
think
this
one
is
what
thayre
all
shooting
for
i
really
only
get
wood
smoke
though
sometimes
like
cooked
meat
sometimes
like
raw
wood
pulp
theres
a
light
malty
finish
with
a
bit
of
sweetness
but
nothing
impressive
the
smoke
is
king
here
and
its
pleasant
the
carbonation
is
nice
makes
it
more
interesting
for
me
otherwise
this
is
kind
of
like
liquid
smoke
its
in
a
nice
place
between
thick
and
thin
good
body
though
the
drink
is
nice
i
suppose
very
good
for
a
smoked
beer
and
the
alcohol
doesnt
get
you
but
in
the
overall
scheme
of
beers
this
just
isnt
easy
to
drink
im
interested
in
the
flavors
though
i
think
that
lasts
briefly
and
the
onedimensionality
will
force
me
to
slow
down
and
lose
interest
worth
a
shot
for
those
who
are
interested
drinkability
a
tasty
brew
if
you
like
your
smoke
cold
and
wet
as
the
temps
begin
to
warm
this
is
the
push
i
need
to
get
the
smoker
ready
for
the
seasons
first
conquest
a
ten
pound
brisket
chomp
d
for
the
fact
that
i
was
scared
of
this
beer
and
the
smell
of
bacon
and
smoky
ham
i
could
drink
these
all
day
at
5
4
i
could
really
have
a
number
of
these
all
together
very
pleasing
i
was
worried
i
wouldnt
appreciate
the
flavor
but
like
everything
else
smoked
i
seem
to
love
this
beer
im
now
glad
i
got
their
wheat
rauchbier
too
d
i
will
be
buying
more
of
this
it
was
more
than
a
pleasure
to
drink
this
would
go
very
well
with
a
veggie
burger
grilled
on
an
old
coal
bbq
topped
with
caramelized
onions
an
interesting
change
of
pace
but
one
that
didnt
deliver
as
hoped
it
didnt
complement
the
sausage
i
had
with
it
as
well
as
most
other
beers
ive
had
in
the
past
specifically
there
wasnt
much
of
an
interplay
of
flavors
just
an
overpowering
smokiness
o
i
am
very
preferrential
to
this
beer
while
marzens
are
probably
my
favorite
style
the
addition
of
the
rauch
malt
to
this
makes
it
even
better
smokey
but
not
over
the
top
take
the
chance
give
it
a
try
conclusion
great
rauchbier
its
beers
like
aecht
schlenkerla
rauchbier
that
make
beer
tasting
so
exciting
inspiring
and
fascinating
dark
red
liquid
with
tan
lacing
and
coffee
and
tobacco
smell
smokey
overall
smellaromaflavor
but
not
overwhelming
compared
to
other
brews
in
the
style
smoked
ham
salty
meat
dishes
and
coffee
are
the
greatest
characteristics
of
the
taste
would
work
great
with
obviously
smoked
dishes
pork
and
fish
smoked
mackerel
comes
to
mind
or
even
ye
ole
bbq
overall
i
really
couldnt
stomach
much
of
this
beer
it
felt
like
drinking
bacon
grease
or
something
it
was
interesting
and
fun
to
try
but
not
a
beer
i
can
drink
much
of
overall
when
i
saw
this
at
the
local
corner
store
i
almost
screamed
with
excitement
i
only
found
out
about
these
recently
my
girlfriend
said
it
best
its
like
two
of
your
favorite
beers
got
together
and
had
a
baby
if
you
like
marzens
andor
rauchbiers
be
sure
to
get
as
many
of
these
as
you
can
but
seriously
finish
is
nice
with
a
little
smokey
aftertaste
i
have
had
other
marzens
and
this
one
by
far
is
one
of
the
best
although
it
is
more
of
a
rauchbier
drink
slow
unless
you
want
your
burps
to
smell
like
the
pits
at
coopers
bbq
in
llano
texas
i
miss
that
place
drinkability
i
love
rauchbier
and
this
is
one
of
the
kings
not
quite
as
good
as
their
urbock
but
an
excellent
example
of
the
style
again
maybe
my
tastebuds
were
weird
that
night
or
maybe
it
was
a
bad
bottle
d
read
about
the
style
and
it
says
acquired
taste
well
isnt
that
the
truth
d
very
smoky
but
also
very
drinkable
i
have
to
be
in
the
mood
for
this
stuff
but
when
i
am
this
is
the
real
deal
for
me
mouthfeel
really
smooth
and
lightly
creamy
with
low
carbonation
that
suits
the
style
feels
great
going
down
i
dont
think
a
highly
carbonated
smoke
beer
would
work
beer
feels
more
like
an
interesting
change
of
pace
than
a
session
beer
the
more
i
drink
it
the
more
im
not
sure
the
smoky
flavors
are
all
that
desirable
in
a
beer
drinkability
i
imagine
this
could
be
a
good
sipping
beer
paired
with
the
proper
foods
not
something
personal
i
could
see
drinking
often
or
alot
but
definitely
and
interesting
try
this
is
an
interesting
one
it
looks
smells
and
tastes
like
a
standard
dunkel
say
könig
ludwig
but
it
has
a
really
powerful
and
enjoyable
smokey
aftertaste
for
all
the
world
like
decent
hessian
ahle
wurst
i
tried
the
bottled
version
but
im
sure
the
smokebomb
is
even
stronger
on
tap
and
bamberg
looks
like
a
great
spot
for
a
beer
holiday
im
still
not
sure
whether
to
view
this
as
a
novelty
beer
or
a
precious
classic
but
if
youre
a
fan
of
cured
meat
and
good
beer
and
youd
like
to
see
the
two
combined
then
schlenkerla
rauchbier
is
for
you
if
youre
not
among
the
initiated
you
wont
want
to
come
near
this
not
a
session
brew
but
this
ba
wouldnt
have
a
problme
enjoying
more
than
one
in
one
sitting
a
wonderful
treat
d
lovely
drink
i
havent
consumed
more
than
one
at
a
time
so
not
sure
of
the
longterm
effects
of
smokiness
dthis
is
not
somethin
i
could
drink
very
often
but
it
is
a
very
unique
brew
mouth
is
suprisingly
clean
maybe
slightly
dry
drinks
really
really
slow
it
might
take
me
a
while
to
finish
this
one
but
damn
its
a
good
beer
im
thinking
it
would
be
good
to
make
a
chili
or
ham
and
beans
with
di
must
say
i
am
not
a
huge
smoked
beer
fan
so
while
i
greatly
appreciate
the
history
and
tradition
of
this
style
i
do
sruggle
to
get
a
whole
pint
down
very
tasty
stuff
went
down
real
easy
this
was
my
first
rauchbier
and
will
definitely
not
be
my
last
pretty
well
balanced
and
great
drinkability
you
gotta
try
this
stuff
if
you
have
not
already

beer
better
go
find
a
miller
lite
who
needs
coffee
stouts
for

you
can
drink
this
instead
or
have
this
with

yummy

the
taste

this

d
a
very
pleasant
drink
overall
but
i
must
say
that
if
drinking
it
alone
it
could
become
boring
after
just
one
pint
or
is
it
because
the
beer
has
expired
after
all
when
i
tasted
it
gotta
revisit
this

pours
a
very
dar
brown
with
white
head
aroma
of
roasted
malts
but
dmoinated
by
a
smokey
charcoal
bbq
scent
this
beer
has
a
very
complex
taste
that
is
dominated
by
a
smoked
charcoal
taste
burnt
malt
accompanied
by
hickory
bbq
very
unique
and
original
but
not
for
everyone
d
too
much
for
me
would
only
want
one
of
these
at
a
time
goes
good
with
a
contrasting
sharp
aged
cheddar
but
would
probably
compliment
a
quality
smoked
meat
at
a
bbq
but
worth
trying
look
forward
to
a
rauchbier
in
bbq
season
somehow
this
seeming
novelty
really
works
as
a
delicious
and
drinkable
beer
quite
a
surprise
the
smoke
is
strong
but
not
overwhelming
or
ashy
great
fun
and
well
worth
seeking
out
definitely
appropriate
for
sipping
by
a
roaring
fire
and
would
be
interesting
to
pair
with
smoked
or
sweet
foods
this
is
the
best
rauchbier
i
have
had
if
you
like
the
style
youll
like
this
brew
d
this
beer
was
a
definite
change
of
pace
for
me
drinkability
is
tough
for
me
to
judge
as
id
have
to
be
in
just
the
right
mood
to
drink
another
one
of
these
however
the
beer
seems
an
excellent
example
of
the
style
i
enjoyed
the
beer
best
when
i
started
drinking
it
alongside
heavy
cheeses
i
studied
in
bamberg
germany
for
a
year
and
this
was
by
far
the
best
and
most
distinct
beer
to
come
out
of
that
famous
brewing
town
many
brews
in
europe
and
abroad
have
tried
to
replicate
this
recipe
but
its
quite
exceptional
the
color
is
mostly
brown
with
some
reddishbrown
elements
and
a
rather
large
head
the
smell
is
immediately
the
first
thing
to
truly
reach
your
senses
and
smells
like
bacon
or
pork
it
goes
down
smooth
and
has
exceptional
taste
but
beware
it
definitely
leaves
a
strong
reminder
in
your
mouth
long
after
consumption
i
highly
recommend
drinking
this
beer
with
a
traditional
german
pork
dish
such
as
schweinebraten
wuerstchen
or
haxe
the
beer
can
also
be
used
to
flavor
foods
when
cooking
this
beer
is
truly
one
of
a
kind
its
easy
to
see
why
this
is
regarded
by
many
as
the
prototype
of
smokebeer
pleasantly
coincidental
is
the
fact
that
under
all
the
smokescreen
this
savory
treat
is
also
a
pretty
damned
fine
marzen
aecht
schlenkerlas
smoky
brew
is
fullish
in
body
with
a
creamy
feel
mild
carbonation
and
great
drinkability
this
beer
pours
a
redish
brown
with
an
beige
colored
head
there
was
good
lacing
on
the
glass
the
aroma
had
a
great
smoky
earthy
smell
to
it
the
taste
was
again
smoky
and
almost
tastes
like
some
variation
of
smoked
bacon
with
a
sweet
malt
background
to
it
the
mouthfeel
was
just
what
it
should
be
the
strong
smokey
flavor
would
make
it
difficult
for
me
to
drink
very
many
of
these
in
one
sitting
this
is
my
first
of
the
style
and
i
am
rating
it
as
best
i
can
but
damn
this
stuff
is
different
really
interesting
style
and
i
think
i
might
have
to
get
another
of
their
offerings
d
very
approachable
for
this
style
of
beer
not
a
session
brew
but
rather
a
sipper
on
a
cold
night
or
with
barbecue
for
those
who
have
not
tried
a
smoke
beer
i
highly
reccommend
they
try
this
one
great
spicy
food
or
cigar
brew
purchased
this
at
wine
and
spirits
shoppe
at
bradley
park
in
columbus
georgia
beer
is
dark
amber
in
color
it
smells
very
smoky
with
a
little
malt
in
the
nose
wow
it
tastes
very
good
the
taste
is
less
smoky
than
the
aroma
it
is
well
balanced
and
fine
tasting
a
surprise
to
say
the
least
i
would
never
have
believed
a
smoke
beer
could
be
so
fun
to
drink
very
diverse
thanks
to
nash
for
the
bottle
the
aroma
is
very
smokey
and
covers
any
other
smells
that
might
be
there
save
a
hint
of
malt
the
appearance
is
dark
brown
and
the
head
is
persistent
the
flavor
is
also
very
smokey
and
not
unlike
beef
jerky
the
palate
was
not
as
thick
as
i
wanted
but
still
its
not
thin
a
very
unique
beer
thats
a
must
try
like
it
or
not
m
d
the
lighter
side
of
a
medium
body
finishes
very
smooth
and
refreshing
this
makes
for
a
wonderful
session
choice
on
a
chillier
fall
day
granted
today
was
not
one
but
it
would
have
been
all
that
much
better
had
it
been
as
a
big
fan
of
dark
germanstyle
lagers
i
found
the
mouthfeel
to
be
maybe
a
bit
light
for
my
taste
but
overall
this
is
a
brilliant
rauchbier
an
enjoyable
sipper
d
i
dont
think
i
could
have
more
than
one
bottle
on
its
own
perhaps
id
make
it
into
my
second
with
some
fine
bbq
to
go
along
with
it
pours
a
leather
brown
body
with
twofinger
tan
head
with
minimal
lacings
one
of
the
strongest
smells
ever
from
a
beer
incredible
smokiness
i
took
a
few
big
whiffs
and
ended
up
with
stuff
like
smoked
meat
think
slim
jims
mints
roasted
malts
mixed
with
spices
just
a
beer
you
have
to
smell
to
believe
so
is
the
taste
to
be
honest
it
is
real
smooth
and
creamy
almost
fullbodied
yet
there
is
this
smokey
dry
almost
processed
meat
taste
to
it
and
i
mean
that
in
a
good
way
there
are
hints
of
sweet
and
roasted
malts
and
dark
fruits
but
the
smokiness
really
comes
through
on
this
beer
but
it
is
reasonable
the
backbite
is
dry
but
not
overly
dry
and
your
pallete
is
killed
like
this
is
a
dipa
or
anything
i
wouldnt
mind
this
beer
again
but
one
is
enough
for
me
it
took
a
little
getting
used
to
d
my
second
true
rauchbier
i
liked
this
much
more
than
their
weizen
probably
because
i
had
it
with
food
a
sirloin
steak
and
my
palate
for
smoked
beers
is
evolving
i
didnt
think
that
a
smoked
flavor
would
mix
well
with
beer
but
i
am
somewhat
surprised
here
this
beer
does
an
excellent
job
of
being
what
its
supposed
to
be
poured
a
nice
dark
reddishgold
appearance
with
thick
offwhitedark
yellow
head
and
lots
of
lacing
the
hints
of
smoked
meat
ham
are
very
present
but
not
over
powering
unique
is
the
word
and
thats
goood
drinkability
an
enjoyable
beer
a
smokeminded
treat
even
but
not
one
i
could
down
on
a
daily
basis
such
a
smokey
baconladen
flavor
and
aroma
that
it
might
be
even
more
recommended
to
friends
of
the
jewish
persuasion
paired
well
with
some
chicken
pan
fried
noodles
the
driver
refused
to
partake
in
the
beer
once
he
smelled
it
the
taste
is
more
complex
with
smokey
grain
lapsang
souchong
tea
up
front
soon
mellowing
and
joined
by
light
toasted
grain
hay
cola
general
toastyherbalspice
dunkel
qualities
the
smokeiness
lingers
though
lightly
after
the
finish
its
light
in
body
but
tatsy
interesting
and
drinkable
with
the
smoke
just
tame
enough
and
just
balanced
enough
so
as
not
to
be
overpowering
d
pretty
drinkable
smokey
flavored
beer
this
would
go
very
well
with
a
good
meat
dinner
it
is
strangely
drinkable
i
highly
recommend
trying
it
drinkability
is
pretty
good
if
you
like
smokey
beers
lacking
subtlety
if
you
wanted
a
märzen
with
a
hint
of
smoke
youll
be
disappointed
i
like
the
fact
that
its
so
robust
and
not
that
strong
only
5
1
abv
on
my
label
still
not
something
id
want
to
drink
all
night
one
is
enough
for
me
i
wanted
to
like
this
more
then
i
did
ive
only
had
their
urbock
previously
and
preferred
the
darker
malts
with
the
smoke
for
a
more
balanced
palate
hey
at
least
we
know
there
werent
any
rats
in
the
grain
this
is
an
outstanding
smoked
beer
the
nose
is
reminiscent
of
a
hungarian
smokehouse
that
i
used
to
patronize
in
bridgeport
ct
without
the
paprika
of
course
it
is
unbelievable
how
wellbalanced
this
beer
is
although
i
was
expecting
the
smoke
taste
to
overwhelmingly
prevail
i
find
that
the
malt
comes
right
through
as
well
this
is
certainly
not
a
session
beer
but
will
nicely
compliment
any
barbecued
food
you
bring
to
the
table
d
this
is
a
an
odd
case
its
not
like
other
beers
but
its
complex
and
drinkable
i
havent
had
that
many
rauchbiers
but
this
one
is
by
far
the
most
interesting
poured
a
clear
brown
color
with
a
small
tan
head
that
faded
fast
smelled
of
steak
and
meat
a
little
a1
sauce
in
there
the
taste
was
the
same
i
picked
up
a
lot
of
smoked
flavors
and
a
steak
or
burger
merinade
some
smoked
wood
going
on
as
well
it
had
a
very
clean
finish
nothing
lingered
for
a
bad
aftertaste
smooth
and
easy
to
drink
this
is
a
very
unique
and
special
beer
it
has
a
dark
brown
color
its
aroma
is
pretty
strong
but
not
strong
enough
compared
to
its
taste
it
will
surprise
you
the
first
time
you
try
it
it
tastes
more
like
bacon
and
ham
than
beer
trying
it
a
couple
will
get
you
addicted
as
you
will
often
feel
the
need
to
have
this
delicacy
it
goes
perfectly
with
meat
it
wont
change
your
taste
but
you
can
also
drink
it
alone
if
you
can
handle
the
strong
taste
then
there
is
no
limit
in
how
many
of
these
you
can
have
in
one
drinking
session
im
not
sure
that
beers
of
this
style
are
really
my
favorites
but
this
is
definitely
a
rauch
done
right
which
i
could
definitely
see
myself
enjoying
at
the
right
place
a
campfire
barbecue
or
smoked
cheese
complimetary
for
sure
d
this
is
a
wonderful
rauchbier
and
lives
up
to
its
classic
status
ive
had
this
beer
on
previous
occasions
and
this
tasting
is
just
as
good
as
previous
i
would
love
to
travel
to
bamberg
and
have
it
close
to
the
source
notes
this
is
my
first
real
rauchbier
and
it
really
is
different
i
am
not
sure
that
i
am
a
big
fan
of
the
style
but
this
seems
like
this
is
a
good
example
of
the
style
note
added
later
i
have
thought
about
this
beer
for
weeks
after
tasting
it
there
have
only
been
a
few
that
stuck
in
my
memory
like
this
one
i
am
upgrading
the
taste
i
can
still
remember
it
for
that
reason
from
4
5
to
5
0
could
not
think
of
a
more
appropriate
beer
to
enjoy
with
an
authentic
german
meal
preferably
with
lots
of
meat
that
matches
the
smokiness
of
the
beer

spots
of
cottony

is

a
deep
dark
amber
color
with
a
three
finger
thick
cream
colored
head
forms
on
top
the
head
laces
slowly
down
the
glass
the
smokiness
is
an
incredible
scent
it
blends
itself
with
a
malty
sweetness
and
doughiness
there
is
no
real
hop
aroma
in
this
beer
the
malt
hits
the
palate
with
a
mild
sweetness
and
the
smoky
flavor
that
dominates
and
envelopes
around
every
taste
bud
then
a
surprisingly
mild
citrus
bitterness
finishes
the
taste
out
a
very
smooth
feel
with
a
mild
crispness
and
is
very
silky
along
the
palate
this
is
an
incredible
beer
there
are
styles
that
you
have
to
taste
from
the
source
this
beer
is
it
throw
this
at
some
smoked
ribs
or
a
pulled
pork
sandwhich
plus
why
doesnt
barbaque
places
have
this
beer
on
tap
or
bottle
smoke
all
the
way
from
the
moment
you
open
the
bottle
you
can
really
feel
the
smoke
hit
you
the
beer
guy
at
whole
foods
that
recommended
this
beet
said
some
people
said
it
tasted
like
drinking
an
ashtray
but
i
disagree
by
just
smelling
the
beer
i
thought
of
smoked
bacon
dunno
i
even
felt
weird
about
drinking
something
that
smelled
like
bacon
the
looks
are
ok
thin
lace
over
a
ruby
colored
body
taste
is
good
it
definitely
does
not
taste
like
meat
or
an
ashtray
it
does
taste
like
an
oktoberfest
covered
in
smoke
some
sweet
malts
medium
body
good
overall
not
my
favorite
style
but
fits
the
style
perfectly
pours
into
my
liter
mug
with
a
deep
chestnut
brown
color
and
a
relatively
tight
cream
head
as
i
poured
i
picked
up
the
melanoidin
malt
that
is
what
a
marzen
is
all
about
upon
further
investigation
the
malt
aroma
starts
out
fully
as
a
smooth
smoke
and
then
gives
way
though
lightly
to
malt
flavor
is
all
malt
up
from
with
medium
body
and
and
more
smoke
at
swallow
after
its
warmed
im
not
sure
if
ive
found
a
bit
of
hops
in
the
finish
of
it
its
just
the
smoke
its
has
a
medium
intensity
and
i
notice
it
more
as
i
breath
out
nowhere
near
as
rich
as
i
expected
this
is
my
first
schlenkerla
but
so
far
is
rather
drinkable
nice
brew
glad
i
tried
it
but
once
will
be
enough
drinkability
is
high
if
you
like
beers
like
this
not
really
my
cup
of
tea
but
it
is
nice
to
try
something
different
every
once
in
a
while
taste
mouthfeel
very
smoky
up
front
but
not
as
dominant
as
the
aroma
suggests
malt
provides
a
good
balance
though
its
not
overly
sweet
a
nice
bold
hop
bitterness
melds
pleasantly
with
the
smoke
in
the
finish
the
light
body
and
crisp
carbonation
make
this
one
surprisingly
drinkable
this
beer
pours
a
semi
dark
amber
with
a
1
fingered
head
with
no
lacing
the
smell
wow
it
smells
like
bacon
like
hickory
smoked
bacon
very
original
to
my
palate
for
a
beer
but
intriguing
the
taste
is
of
bacon
and
malts
with
hardly
any
hops
flavor
the
mouthfeel
is
pleasant
and
the
carbonation
level
is
nice
its
a
nice
novelty
beergag
joke
that
actually
tastes
good
but
not
something
i
would
drink
alot
of
i
got
one
of
these
for
my
brothers
wife
who
puts
mayo
and
bacon
on
everything
she
eats
d
this
one
was
interesting
id
never
had
anything
like
it
before
very
tasty
and
a
perfect
pairing
with
sweet
bbq
or
a
smoked
turkey
sandwich
slightly
warming
in
the
throat
smooth
medium
bodied
brew
very
light
effervescence
i
really
like
this
style
but
the
other
offerings
from
this
brewer
are
better
the
weizen
somewhat
the
urbock
much
more
so
a
fine
beer
and
unique
to
me
the
flavor
is
not
overpowering
by
any
means
but
i
can
only
do
so
much
smoke
overall
an
excellent
that
i
highly
recommend
great
example
of
the
style
only
wish
it
was
available
here
would
be
part
of
the
semi
regular
rotation
if
here
since
its
not
its
a
definite
pickup
every
time
i
go
to
indy
look
forward
to
others
by
them
d
what
an
amazing
beer
easily
drinkable
and
will
pair
amazingly
with
meats
i
intend
to
always
have
a
couple
of
these
in
my
fridge
wow
had
on
tap
at
the
old
bierhall
in
bamberg
the
beer
is
clear
dark
copper
with
interesting
highlights
the
head
is
thin
tan
and
slightly
rocky
the
smell
is
smoke
burnt
caramel
pepper
and
hops
and
smoke
and
more
smoke
it
tastes
of
warm
scotch
caramel
a
touch
of
mint
and
a
smoky
but
not
overpoweringly
so
finish
plus
more
smoke
the
mouthfeel
is
slick
very
smooth
but
just
a
bit
watery
very
little
carbonation
it
is
drinkable
beer
with
a
good
balance
of
sweetness
smoke
after
a
while
the
smoke
builds
up
its
just
too
much
for
me
rauchbiers
are
interesting
but
they
are
for
someone
else
if
you
like
them
go
to
bamberg
you
wont
be
dissappointed
d
pretty
good
barring
the
alcohol
tingle
i
only
have
only
had
one
other
rauchbier
which
was
from
the
same
brewery
and
i
prefer
that
one
the
other
one
tasting
more
like
beef
jerky
rather
than
bacon
this
one
isnt
bad
seems
to
be
balanced
without
having
overpowering
smoke
flavor
i
think
the
smokiness
goes
better
with
the
thickness
of
the
bockier
beer
recommended
although
the
beer
is
excellent
that
smoky
taste
is
too
much
for
more
than
one
beer
not
as
flavorful
and
complex
as
i
had
imagined
in
my
mind
oh
well
pours
a
dark
brown
color
with
ruby
highlights
with
a
dense
offwhite
head
the
quickly
dissipates
into
a
light
ring
the
aroma
is
of
liquid
smoke
charred
soy
marinated
meat
wet
burnt
wood
big
smoke
flavors
charred
malt
roasted
meat
a
touch
of
soy
sauce
the
total
campfire
experience
the
feel
is
fairly
light
for
such
a
heavy
flavored
beer
i
would
like
to
have
a
little
more
malt
body
to
help
handle
the
intense
smoke
flavors
great
smoke
flavors
in
this
brew
it
pretty
much
emcompasses
the
whole
beer
i
would
like
to
see
a
heavier
nonsmoked
malt
to
balance
the
smoke
and
add
some
additional
flavor
had
this
at
novare
res
in
portland
served
in
a
seidel
it
was
a
dark
brown
color
with
red
highlights
the
head
was
offwhite
and
thick
and
left
some
great
lacing
the
aroma
was
definitely
smoky
in
a
good
way
as
well
as
some
caramel
the
taste
echoed
the
aroma
there
was
a
little
mild
hop
taste
later
a
smooth
enjoyable
beer
this
is
a
good
beer
session
beer
no
tasty
beer
yes
may
have
the
strongest
smoke
taste
of
any
smoked
beer
i
have
ever
had
d
i
cant
wait
to
have
a
few
of
these
with
ribs
or
pulled
pork
i
wouldnt
want
more
than
a
few
but
hard
to
stop
once
you
start
mdthis
has
a
bite
on
the
front
and
after
that
it
goes
down
smooth
the
smoke
scent
is
something
that
for
me
is
too
overwhelming
i
would
like
to
try
the
other
brands
before
giving
up
on
this
one
i
concede
that
rauchbier
isnt
my
style
of
choice
but
the
flavor
is
intriguing
to
say
the
least
dusty
earthen
malts
up
front
are
followed
by
a
blast
of
beefy
smoke
a
kiss
of
green
peppery
hops
light
up
the
back
of
the
palate
on
the
finish
body
is
lighter
than
i
anticipated
but
is
smooth
and
semicreamy
with
a
perfect
carbonation
level
this
was
a
good
beer
experience
and
one
i
look
forward
to
having
again
id
love
to
see
how
this
rauchbier
pairs
with
some
grilled
meat
or
dark
chocolate
i
love
smoked
food
and
this
is
just
the
absolute
perfect
pairing
for
a
night
outside
with
some
friends
and
a
smoker
wonderful
never
had
a
beer
like
this
i
read
the
other
reviews
and
was
scared
to
try
it
because
of
the
smoky
taste
i
actually
like
the
smoky
taste
the
smoke
is
more
of
an
aftertaste
you
taste
the
smoke
more
when
you
breath
out
after
a
sip
kind
of
weird
ill
pick
this
one
up
again
edit
had
to
lower
my
drinkability
score
on
a
more
opinionated
note
i
found
it
harder
to
drink
this
as
it
warmed
and
the
flavors
intensified
just
a
bit
too
intense
for
me
and
not
sessionable
turned
into
a
sipper
however
again
because
this
is
such
an
interesting
style
and
more
likely
a
great
interpretation
of
it
it
is
a
decent
brew
just
not
something
i
would
look
too
hard
for
but
if
i
was
at
a
bbq
this
would
be
a
nice
surprise
to
accompany
some
well
cooked
meats
tastes
very
similar
to
smoked
meats
bacon
comes
to
mind
some
hop
bitterness
and
sweet
malts
drinkability
on
most
rachbiers
wont
ever
be
more
than
a
4
for
me
theyre
too
potent
but
usually
and
in
the
case
of
this
one
its
not
in
any
sort
of
negative
way
its
just
stops
you
from
gulping
it
keeping
this
in
mind
though
the
urbock
beer
by
this
brewery
is
better
and
more
potent
smokewise
in
my
opinion
this
is
surprisingly
drinkable
i
thought
would
have
trouble
choking
it
down
but
the
way
the
smoke
presents
itself
is
extremely
approachable
i
doubt
id
drink
it
often
but
it
was
well
worth
the
price
of
admission
drinkability
is
great
this
is
a
very
distinct
and
unique
brew
the
smoked
flavors
give
it
a
meaty
profile
while
the
malts
balance
out
the
spice
from
the
smoke
the
aftertaste
is
reminiscent
of
beef
jerky
this
could
very
well
be
a
polarizing
brew
because
of
the
flavors
present
but
the
proportioning
and
profile
are
excellent
nonetheless
cheers
d
sure
its
a
bit
like
a
meal
but
it
is
incredibly
smooth
and
surely
hit
or
miss
to
most
you
either
love
it
or
hate
it
and
i
love
it
an
all
time
favorite
d
this
is
an
unusual
and
very
savory
beer
it
is
an
excellent
example
of
the
style
and
while
it
may
be
a
difficult
taste
to
aquire
its
a
great
beer
when
youre
in
the
right
mood
d
an
interesting
beer
for
something
different
not
something
id
drink
every
day
but
id
love
to
have
another
with
some
smoked
sausage
and
german
potato
salad
drinkability
quite
drinkable
with
somewhate
less
smokiness
than
the
bottled
version
and
a
great
balance
of
smoke
with
the
hops
beautiful
beer
fresh
from
the
casks
and
a
world
class
experience
at
heller
trum
in
bamberg
this
is
not
a
style
i
care
to
delve
much
more
deeply
into
some
beers
are
an
acquired
taste
this
is
not
one
i
think
i
care
to
acqure
pours
a
dark
ruby
hue
with
a
one
finger
light
khaki
colored
head
that
dies
down
to
a
fluffy
layer
of
bubbles
spotty
lacing
is
left
on
the
sides
of
the
glass
smell
is
beef
jerky
and
campfire
smoke
with
a
hint
of
sweet
molasses
lots
of
roasted
grains
and
a
bit
of
caramel
malt
in
the
nose
as
well
i
have
never
smelled
anything
like
this
before
lets
see
how
this
one
tastes
taste
begins
with
a
smoked
kielbasa
that
was
cooked
while
tailgating
truthfully
in
the
parking
lot
of
ralph
wilson
stadium
midway
a
bit
of
brown
sugar
sweetness
tickles
the
tongue
ending
with
a
charred
oak
like
aftertaste
thats
on
the
dry
side
medium
to
full
body
with
a
creamy
smooth
feel
carbonation
is
fairly
low
but
fits
the
beer
very
well
this
beer
really
improves
as
it
warms
the
flavors
seem
to
be
more
pronounced
to
be
honest
before
i
even
opened
this
bottle
i
wasnt
sure
if
i
would
be
able
to
finish
this
beer
i
would
be
in
heaven
if
dinosaur
bbq
downtown
had
this
on
hand
drunken
spicy
shrimp
tres
hombre
and
aecht
schlenkerla
rauchbier
marzen
may
just
be
the
perfect
combination
i
may
have
to
get
another
bottle
of
this
and
some
dinosaur
take
out
very
soon
d
very
good
drinkability
making
for
a
great
smoky
treat
the
first
time
i
had
this
i
was
literally
shocked
by
the
pronounced
huge
flavor
now
having
and
enjoying
this
beer
and
style
several
times
it
is
perhaps
one
of
the
finest
and
smoothest
by
nature
and
a
prime
example
extremely
smooth
and
easy
to
consume
once
you
are
accustomed
to
its
unique
and
straightforward
flavor
and
only
gets
easy
and
better
after
every
tasting
i
tried
this
beer
on
january
28
2008
at
smokeless
joes
in
toronto
the
beer
poured
a
brownishblack
into
the
glass
with
minimal
head
and
an
oily
look
the
aroma
was
smoked
wood
as
well
as
some
roasted
malty
tones
the
mouthfeel
was
light
bodied
almost
watery
yet
creamy
with
little
carbonation
the
flavour
was
very
much
like
burnt
bacon
and
burnt
coffee
m
full
body
with
a
medium
carbonation
if
i
ever
get
another
bottle
of
this
brew
i
will
definately
mix
it
to
try
some
improvements
it
is
not
enjoyable
to
drink
this
pure
you
might
as
well
lick
an
ashtray
ive
saved
this
bottle
for
my
100th
review
and
now
im
glad
that
i
did
this
pours
dark
and
almost
purple
looking
until
held
to
direct
light
then
it
reveals
deep
mahogany
with
lots
of
redthe
cap
is
almond
and
leaves
polka
dot
lacing
as
it
dissapates
the
smell
is
almost
all
smokelike
a
jumbo
smoked
turkey
leg
with
hints
of
fresh
cut
oak
timbers
and
leather
this
tastes
like
smoked
ham
and
suttle
cloveits
mostly
malty
with
burnt
tobacco
notesthe
flavors
sound
overwhelming
but
are
anything
butthis
is
a
medium
body
brewnot
heavy
like
i
expectedi
am
impressed
this
is
my
first
experience
with
a
rauchbier
and
might
be
my
only
for
awhile
as
it
looks
like
this
is
the
only
rauchbier
carried
by
my
local
total
wine
it
was
easy
for
me
to
evaluate
this
beer
based
on
my
own
tastes
but
i
really
couldnt
compare
it
in
context
it
was
a
highly
unique
and
enjoyable
experience
far
out
of
the
realm
of
most
beer
im
used
to
and
wouldnt
mind
trying
more
yummo
a
tasty
smoky
treat
maybe
not
the
best
for
warmer
times
but
a
nice
addition
to
a
fall
or
winter
meal
overall
the
smoke
flavor
could
have
been
toned
down
for
me
personally
not
sure
how
this
stacks
up
against
other
beers
of
this
style
because
it
is
only
my
second
finish
is
clean
as
you
would
expect
from
a
lager
suprisingly
this
would
be
a
good
session
beer
a
beer
unlike
any
other
ive
had
id
love
to
try
another
rauch
da
nice
rauch
but
not
quite
as
good
as
the
festbier
of
theirs
i
first
saw
this
style
of
beer
at
total
wine
in
fort
myers
fl
as
i
attempted
to
pronounce
the
phlegm
inducing
tongue
twister
of
a
name
i
thought
to
myself
smoke
beer
is
this
going
to
taste
like
dear
old
grandma
abigails
ashes
it
was
nothing
like
that
at
all
i
slowly
poured
the
rich
tawny
brew
into
a
pilsener
stlye
glass
i
had
never
heard
of
rauchbeir
before
then
so
i
had
no
idea
what
vessel
to
enjoy
it
in
i
put
my
nostril
up
to
the
rim
and
inhaled
deeply
fresh
smokey
hardwood
wafted
into
my
nose
it
reminded
me
of
a
summer
barbeque
with
weiners
on
the
grill
i
took
a
swig
and
swished
it
around
my
pallet
what
a
symphony
of
smoked
meat
flavoring
and
faint
oak
it
was
absolutely
delectable
i
had
never
experienced
anything
close
to
it
now
i
live
in
gainesville
and
i
am
totally
craving
the
jimmy
dean
goodness
that
is
rauchbeir
i
have
already
ordered
a
case
for
the
liquor
store
i
work
at
d
very
special
and
different
would
go
great
with
a
bbq
but
would
not
pick
this
beer
to
drink
one
after
the
other
a
very
nice
rauchbier
that
i
recently
had
the
privelege
of
trying
in
a
party
ball
miniature
keg
for
my
pa
people
you
can
get
them
at
shangys
in
emmaus
for
22
00
francisweizen
and
i
are
enjoying
one
right
now
strong
rich
smokey
flavor
very
mellow
warm
mouthfeel
one
of
the
tastiest
marzens
i
have
had
the
initial
flavor
comes
smooth
and
slow
and
builds
to
a
full
minutely
bitter
finish
if
you
are
in
the
market
for
a
nice
rauchbier
this
is
probably
one
of
your
best
options
this
is
a
very
interesting
beerstyle
i
really
enjoyed
it
not
an
everyday
beer
but
its
a
nice
novelty
treat
would
pair
perfectly
with
some
southern
pork
bbq
smoked
whitefish
or
maybe
a
smoked
gouda
crackers
clouds
of
smoke
in
the
flavour
which
although
peculiarly
meaty
has
a
fairly
light
mouthfeel
theres
a
prominent
graininess
thatll
be
all
the
smoked
bamberg
malt
and
really
not
much
else
other
than
wave
after
wave
of
smoke
decent
level
of
carbonation
overall
this
is
a
bit
of
a
onedimensional
beer
but
what
a
dimension
i
imagine
it
would
be
perfect
with
sausages
and
by
the
fire
on
a
cold
night
sounds
like
ill
be
taking
this
with
me
next
time
i
go
camping
very
unique
to
my
palate
and
highly
enjoyable
smooth
and
easy
drinkin
despite
the
extreme
flavor
medium
body
and
perfect
carbonation
drinkability
is
decent
for
me
i
could
have
one
more
but
then
i
would
be
done
with
it
cheers
even
though
not
everybody
is
going
to
like
this
bier
the
style
is
worth
a
try
drinkability
the
taste
is
such
that
its
hard
to
imagine
drinking
several
in
one
sitting
its
great
to
test
ones
palate
to
but
the
smoked
character
of
this
beer
makes
it
difficult
to
enjoy
without
some
sort
of
food
or
alone
multiple
times
very
very
good
overall
in
one
sitting
however
drinkability
this
is
my
first
foray
into
the
realm
of
the
rauchbier
it
was
very
interesting
and
not
totally
uninviting
im
glad
i
chose
the
malty
marzen
version
its
an
acquired
taste
and
i
think
that
given
time
i
can
get
to
where
i
really
appreciate
it
i
paired
this
with
some
grilledsmoked
andouille
sausage
which
was
a
perfect
compliment
to
the
rauchbier
from
city
beer
store
in
s
f
poured
a
rich
dark
brown
in
a
weizen
glass
with
a
nice
light
tan
head
good
lacing
too
smell
was
very
reminiscent
of
salted
and
peppered
beef
jerky
and
smoked
bbq
and
although
it
was
very
obvious
it
wasnt
as
extremely
overpowering
or
offensive
as
i
feared
i
found
it
extremely
enticing
and
the
taste
was
not
a
letdown
either
the
base
of
the
beer
itself
was
smooth
perfectly
malty
and
sweet
with
a
touch
of
lingering
smokiness
and
light
bitterness
in
the
finish
it
was
very
full
flavored
not
overdone
and
perfectly
crisp
from
the
carbonation
and
i
was
shocked
at
how
drinkable
this
stuff
was
i
expected
this
to
be
a
letdown
bc
i
was
quite
excited
to
try
it
but
i
was
very
pleasantly
surprised
very
good
and
i
cant
wait
to
try
the
other
2
varieties
d
i
truly
love
this
beer
i
can
imagine
how
perfect
it
would
be
with
pulled
pork
bbq
and
smoked
ribs
unfortunately
i
currently
only
have
baked
potato
pringles
i
need
more
and
you
need
to
try
it
just
do
it
the
lack
of
complexity
and
the
overriding
campfiresmoker
taste
somewhat
hinder
the
drinkability
yet
this
isnt
bad
by
any
means
its
worth
a
try
and
went
well
with
a
good
slice
of
pepperoni
pizza
i
wish
i
had
some
anchovies
on
it
which
probably
would
have
been
great
with
this
rauchbier
i
dont
know
how
often
ill
grab
this
or
any
other
smoke
beer
but
if
someone
offers
me
a
cold
aecht
schlenkerla
rauchbier
marzen
i
wont
say
no
fear
not
i
couldnt
finish
this
beer
ill
be
sure
to
keep
away
from
beers
labeled
smoked
in
the
near
future
maybe
when
im
older
ill
revisit
them
and
maybe
ill
look
for
ones
in
smaller
bottles
taste
is
not
too
bad
but
funny
thing
is
the
nose
strangles
the
flavour
i
can
tell
im
drinking
a
particularly
flavoured
lager
but
then
the
smoke
kicks
into
my
nose
and
i
lose
the
flavour
maybe
thats
the
point
im
getting
hints
of
that
smokey
bacon
flavour
on
the
front
palate
and
a
bit
of
toastiness
the
back
palate
which
is
disappointingly
short
is
where
the
hops
lie
and
it
would
be
quite
underwhelming
in
flavour
if
not
for
the
fact
that
the
back
palate
is
where
the
aroma
comes
blundering
in
overall
an
interesting
brew
i
certainly
couldnt
drink
masses
of
it
but
its
an
experience
and
not
a
bad
one
like
i
said
earlier
if
im
in
the
mood
for
something
a
little
off
the
beaten
path
this
is
what
i
pick
up
this
is
one
world
class
rauchbier
drinkability
astoundingly
i
could
drink
lots
of
this
at
any
barbecue
cookoff
or
any
other
meat
eating
activity
but
to
not
be
food
racist
im
sure
this
would
pair
well
with
smoked
mushrooms
as
well
there
was
a
strong
but
smooth
smoke
aroma
immediately
upon
opening
the
bottle
it
has
a
very
pretty
reddish
brown
color
and
a
thin
off
white
head
that
dissipates
quickly
smells
like
bacon
on
a
campfire
very
smooth
mouthfeel
the
smoky
flavor
gives
way
to
a
buttery
nutty
flavor
that
hangs
in
your
mouth
long
after
finishing
the
beer
this
is
the
most
drinkable
rauchbeer
ive
had
and
definitely
one
of
my
favorites
plenty
of
smoke
but
perfectly
integrated
very
tasty
and
balanced
beer
with
no
shortage
of
character
poured
a
22oz
into
a
chimay
chalice
2
pours
poured
a
dark
brown
with
ruby
highlights
and
a
nice
1
inch
head
that
dissipated
quickly
and
left
no
lacing
aroma
is
smoked
meats
like
oak
smoked
bacon
slight
saltiness
i
thought
the
taste
was
very
1
dimensional
i
get
the
salty
smokiness
but
not
much
more
the
smoke
is
a
bit
overpowering
it
doesnt
highlight
the
beer
it
overwhelms
it
mouthfeel
is
medium
bodied
with
light
carbonation
i
think
this
is
a
dont
miss
if
youre
a
big
smoked
beer
person
i
think
this
is
the
first
5
i
gave
anything
on
flavor
that
is
because
within
its
style
category
i
cannot
imagine
it
improving
any
more
also
i
had
it
fresh
on
tap
across
the
street
from
the
brewery
a
warm
buffed
and
oiled
woodsy
brown
with
a
pillowy
offwhite
head
aromas
of
juicy
munich
malt
campfires
and
a
hint
of
sulphur
flavors
of
smoked
pork
charred
wood
but
without
bitterness
and
the
finely
tooled
leather
belt
they
used
to
jam
in
my
mouth
during
my
childhood
fits
this
is
incredible
stuff
and
is
certainly
not
for
everyone
bottled
bacon
is
an
aquired
taste
d
highly
drinkable
for
a
rauchbeer
and
i
feel
a
better
than
the
urbock
brown
body
with
amber
highlights
little
head
to
speak
of
aroma
is
all
smoky
wood
virtually
no
malt
just
burning
wood
flavor
is
also
heavy
on
the
smoky
notes
some
malt
comes
through
but
pretty
much
all
smoke
mouthfeel
is
solid
drinkability
is
ok
but
a
little
more
rich
malt
sweetness
to
balance
the
dry
smokiness
would
be
nice
pours
deep
brown
with
reddish
hues
nice
two
finger
tan
head
a
nice
aroma
off
the
top
of
smoked
sausages
i
never
thought
the
smell
of
sausage
would
be
good
in
a
beer
first
sip
is
very
nice
a
hint
of
sweetness
followed
by
a
lemon
sharpness
the
flavor
in
the
beer
mellows
as
the
beer
warms
the
drinkability
is
ok
very
filling
i
dont
think
i
could
drink
more
than
one
when
all
is
said
and
done
an
extremely
tasty
brew
this
one
will
definately
be
revisited
interesting
i
think
i
was
expecting
something
on
the
lines
os
smokey
scotch
whisky
which
i
love
think
lavagulin
or
talisker
the
smell
was
promising
just
enough
smoke
with
malts
all
i
get
on
the
pallete
is
smoke
like
a
barbecue
or
smokehouse
or
my
fireplace
i
would
probably
enjoy
aout
4
oz
of
this
at
the
right
time
to
me
this
is
definately
not
a
quaffer
i
will
try
it
again
paired
with
food
pours
a
orangetinted
amber
topped
by
a
just
notquitewhite
head
as
youd
expect
from
a
classic
marzen
one
has
to
prepare
for
the
smoky
aroma
with
a
hint
of
malt
it
was
disconcerting
until
i
thought
of
the
smokiness
id
expect
from
a
nice
singlemalt
islay
scotch
or
a
smoked
dryaged
schwarzwalder
ham
with
that
in
mind
the
smokiness
is
a
nice
rich
flavorful
smoke
that
complements
the
marzen
remarkably
well
unlike
some
other
flavored
beers
this
one
does
not
skimp
on
the
base
beer
the
melanoidin
maltiness
comes
through
the
cloud
of
hardwood
campfirey
smoke
and
smooths
the
edges
of
the
smoke
and
light
hop
bitterness
the
mouthfeel
is
typical
marzen
and
while
it
would
otherwise
be
a
dangerously
drinkable
beer
the
smoke
flavor
would
wear
out
its
welcome
drinkability
i
had
about
two
sips
before
my
carcrash
fascination
wore
off
and
i
pushed
it
back
to
my
friend
a
powerful
beer
not
something
for
everybody
but
something
thats
worth
seeking
out
i
will
definitely
be
drinking
this
again
drinkability
its
a
rauchbier
an
occasional
indulgence
at
best
but
an
enjoyable
one
when
you
do
go
there
overall
this
is
an
interesting
style
i
like
the
smoked
flavors
and
aromas
but
i
would
be
hard
pressed
to
drink
more
than
one
of
these
unless
maybe
i
was
trying
to
finish
a
honeybaked
ham
i
purchased
this
bottle
in
bamberg
after
visiting
the
brewery
pours
a
dark
ruby
red
with
big
clingy
head
smoke
aroama
is
very
present
but
not
offensive
after
a
few
swigs
one
becomes
acostemed
to
the
smoke
and
you
can
tell
this
a
very
good
marzen
nicely
balanced
malt
falvor
with
a
hop
bitterness
i
had
this
beer
with
some
smoked
salmon
and
it
was
fantastic
very
easy
drinking
and
pure
joy
to
consume
my
first
ever
smoked
beer
and
im
not
really
sure
what
to
say
i
have
nothing
to
compare
it
to
so
this
review
is
a
little
more
different
than
usual
appearancewise
this
strongly
resembles
a
stout
although
not
entirely
as
dark
a
brownishcocoa
color
that
pours
with
a
nice
head
smell
is
very
smoky
as
would
be
expected
from
what
is
called
a
smoked
beer
this
definitely
does
taste
very
smoky
with
a
distinct
smoked
flavor
dominating
the
palate
tastes
somewhat
liked
smoked
fish
and
is
very
different
from
anything
ive
ever
sampled
an
interesting
brew
that
certainly
deserves
recognition
for
its
unique
aroma
and
flavor
this
is
a
good
brew
but
not
sure
if
id
want
to
drink
more
than
the
1
09
fl
oz
that
the
bottle
provided
as
the
taste
can
be
somewhat
overpowering
at
times
all
in
all
definitely
worth
a
try
and
very
unique
this
one
however
tastes
rather
like
a
light
stout
good
dryness
with
some
smoked
ham
addition
i
am
having
it
with
some
black
forest
ham
just
a
delicious
pairing
d
any
more
than
one
in
a
session
would
be
too
much
but
its
a
top
notch
beer
that
i
would
recommend
to
someone
wanting
something
different
to
the
usual
fare
d
i
love
a
rauchbier
and
this
is
top
notch
finally
theres
a
bit
of
an
acidic
of
even
iodine
note
in
the
very
back
of
the
flavor
of
the
two
i
prefer
the
marzen
but
both
are
great
no
yeast
in
this
bottle
either
25
oz
bottle
from
the
lighthouse
in
manchester
dark
brownred
translucent
body
with
a
good
half
inch
of
offwhite
head
smells
malty
peaty
and
smokey
tastes
malty
at
first
but
quickly
goes
to
peaty
and
ashy
for
the
style
this
is
spoton
and
i
suspect
itd
pair
greatly
with
a
smoked
gouda
or
pork
sausage
as
it
is
its
a
bit
overwhelming
by
itself
for
my
taste
nevertheless
nearly
flawless
and
wellcrafted
for
sure
it
is
what
it
is
wow
i
have
to
keep
in
mind
that
im
reviewing
this
beer
with
the
strict
consideration
of
its
style
i
didnt
think
that
a
smoked
flavor
would
mix
well
with
beer
but
i
am
somewhat
surprised
here
i
make
my
own
jerky
in
a
smoker
and
this
beer
also
has
the
same
kind
of
odor
as
smoked
beef
and
venison
this
beer
does
an
excellent
job
of
being
what
its
supposed
to
be
the
beer
has
a
nice
dark
reddishgold
appearance
with
thick
offwhitedark
yellow
head
and
lots
of
lacing
it
almost
tastes
just
like
my
jerky
as
well
minus
the
spicyness
but
theres
also
a
sweet
kind
of
malt
flavor
as
well
maybe
a
little
nutty
too
not
too
thick
nor
weak
just
right
this
seems
to
be
to
be
a
special
kind
of
beer
that
you
only
have
one
of
as
a
treat
while
watching
family
guy
and
eating
sharp
cheddar
cheese
before
you
go
to
bed
i
like
this
beer
way
better
than
the
first
time
i
had
it
about
five
or
six
years
ago
much
better
than
i
remember
very
good
rauchbier
d
i
never
keep
more
than
a
bottle
in
my
place
because
that
is
all
you
need
one
of
these
is
a
nice
departure
but
i
could
never
envision
myself
having
more
than
one
definitely
different
a
worth
a
try
though
500
ml
bottle
from
bevmo
this
beer
pours
a
very
dark
bark
brown
with
a
cream
colored
head
that
slowly
dissipates
the
aroma
is
very
strong
with
smoke
and
roasted
malts
flavor
is
very
smoke
forward
there
is
a
character
of
smoked
kielbasa
bacon
coffee
and
some
earthy
notes
hops
are
well
integrated
and
barely
noticeableno
surprise
considering
the
strong
smoke
flavor
the
mouthfeel
is
silky
but
thin
carbonation
is
light
but
adequate
finishes
long
with
more
smoke
flavor
overall
i
really
like
this
beer
it
has
big
bold
flavors
recommended
d
the
classic
smoke
flavor
of
schlenkerla
is
one
that
most
seem
to
either
love
or
hate
personally
i
enjoy
the
complexity
and
flavor
it
brings
forth
transforming
an
everyday
marzen
into
a
smoky
delight
taste
of
smoked
sausage
and
smoked
fatty
fish
a
light
bitter
combined
with
a
maltbitterness
on
top
of
a
light
maltbase
the
smoke
sets
the
character
of
this
beer
and
although
the
smoke
is
not
sharp
or
burned
it
lays
a
small
layer
of
smoke
in
my
mouth
body
is
quite
thin
and
carbonation
is
low
aftertaste
is
lingering
smoke
s
this
is
a
very
rich
beer
that
should
be
a
onepernight
sort
of
thing
i
cant
see
myself
drinking
a
lot
of
this
at
all
it
drinks
fairly
slowly
because
of
the
richness
was
cooking
out
today
keeping
in
the
spirit
decided
to
do
a
rauch
this
beer
pours
a
dark
copper
color
w
a
slight
head
that
dissapates
quickly
decent
lacing
a
smoky
sweetish
aroma
hard
to
tell
whats
under
the
smoke
but
it
is
pleasant
more
smoke
here
w
some
hop
flavor
a
slightly
caramel
note
nice
med
body
clean
finish
w
a
smokey
aftertaste
that
gently
lingers
not
overpowering
at
all
tho
it
gets
a
bit
much
towards
the
end
this
beer
went
well
with
my
brats
hots
and
is
a
very
drinkable
rauch
indeed
i
really
like
the
beer
incredibly
drinkable
smoke
is
not
overpowering
at
all
the
malt
sweetness
and
light
hop
twang
add
complexity
i
am
a
big
fan
of
anything
smoky
and
this
beer
is
no
exception
had
with
some
bbq
chicken
wings
and
sharp
cheddar
which
made
a
very
nice
pairing
mouthfeel
was
a
bit
chewy
lingering
on
the
tongue
for
a
few
seconds
a
good
beer
certainly
worth
a
try
but
not
sessionable
by
any
means
i
think
ive
found
a
new
favorite
this
smells
like
a
good
ol
southern
bbq
very
porkybeefy
aroma
and
a
very
smooth
taste
super
dark
super
rich
and
a
wonderful
treat
i
cant
even
describe
it
but
i
defintely
spent
about
10
minutes
with
my
nose
buried
in
the
glass
just
enjoying
the
smell
this
beer
is
a
true
masterpiece
d
could
anything
possibly
be
better
with
a
sausage
and
cheese
plate
i
love
rauchbiers
in
fact
its
one
of
my
favorite
styles
and
this
is
a
prime
example
of
how
drinkable
a
rauchy
can
be
although
i
like
the
more
powerful
and
assertive
urbock
this
one
is
slightly
more
drinkable
although
much
less
complex
i
need
to
do
a
side
by
side
tasting
of
all
the
aechtschlenkerla
rauchbiers
with
a
big
ass
give
box
of
all
of
those
cheeses
and
sausages
from
swiss
colony
that
would
be
heaven
first
taste
overwhelmingly
rich
flavor
takes
over
the
palate
this
beer
is
huge
on
taste
besides
being
smokey
there
is
a
bitterness
like
walnuts
which
ends
with
a
big
grain
flavor
in
a
way
i
wish
there
was
more
to
say
about
this
beer
but
the
simplicity
and
notable
balance
in
its
character
speak
for
itself
highly
recommended
a
true
tasting
experience
with
brew
craftsmanship
to
be
awed
drinks
very
easy
great
raucshbier
a
little
more
restrained
for
better
worse
than
the
urbock
yummy
the
first
taste
is
incredibly
strong
in
both
a
good
and
bad
way
it
truly
pleases
the
taste
buds
and
is
quite
smooth
but
the
smokiness
of
the
beer
somewhat
overpowers
any
other
tastes
at
first
after
a
few
sips
the
flavor
starts
to
mellow
a
little
bit
and
the
beers
fullness
truly
comes
through
all
in
all
its
not
necessarily
a
beer
i
would
search
out
and
certainly
one
to
drink
too
many
of
but
a
tasty
beer
nonetheless
the
beer
is
recognizably
well
crafted
and
skillfully
balanced
still
it
can
be
a
little
overwhelming
offputting
even
on
first
try
it
is
perhaps
the
most
acquired
taste
of
all
beer
styles
it
took
me
a
bit
of
time
to
appreciate
rauchbiers
but
i
love
them
now
and
those
brewed
by
brauerei
schlenkerla
are
unquestionably
the
best
out
there
whether
you
end
up
loving
or
hate
it
trying
rauchbier
promises
to
be
a
unique
experience
taste
is
wildly
earthy
and
untamed
like
the
outdoors
campfire
smoke
and
more
smoke
sausage
some
sweet
malty
caramel
notes
to
balance
heathery
sweetness
as
well
some
cocoa
bitterness
and
lots
of
woody
flavour
as
well
with
a
good
crackery
malt
base
mouthfeel
is
awesome
with
a
smooth
soft
water
feel
mellow
carbonation
is
just
spot
on
very
mild
and
subtle
light
sticky
driness
in
the
finish
but
creamy
in
the
mouth
well
done
and
i
wish
i
had
access
to
this
beer
in
mb
its
just
a
natural
pairing
for
so
much
good
eastern
european
food
had
this
one
at
a
friends
beertasting
session
first
one
on
the
list
appearance
is
brown
with
a
smallish
head
a
light
touch
of
lacing
nose
is
bacon
tons
of
of
smoked
malt
likewise
the
taste
is
smoked
malt
interesting
cause
its
highly
smoked
but
also
very
smooth
meat
flavors
come
through
also
almost
no
hops
medium
body
a
tasty
and
unique
one
deep
brown
and
clear
with
reddish
and
burnt
orange
highlights
fine
beige
foam
settled
quickly
to
a
thick
ring
and
thin
layer
of
bubbles
sticky
fine
lacing
smells
like
a
combination
of
a
camp
fire
and
smoked
meat
really
burnt
and
smokey
mild
bitterness
with
plenty
of
sweet
malt
notes
of
caramel
and
brown
sugar
before
the
smokey
flavour
kicks
in
at
the
finish
lightish
body
with
moderate
carbonation
solid
mouthfeel
although
the
smoke
is
strong
in
the
aroma
its
really
balanced
nicely
in
the
flavour
rauchbiers
really
arent
my
thing
but
this
one
has
a
nice
balance
that
i
like
without
sacrificing
the
smoke
still
it
smells
like
smoked
bacon
maybe
next
time
i
should
try
it
with
sunday
brunch
drinkability
is
higher
than
i
would
have
thought
i
can
see
drinking
a
few
of
these
on
a
winter
night
in
bamberg
nice
beer
nice
style
d
obviously
a
true
smoked
beer
is
going
to
suffer
at
least
a
little
on
drinkability
but
for
the
style
its
unexpectedly
smooth
appearance
is
a
rich
dark
brown
with
a
thin
head
that
dissapates
quickly
aroma
has
a
lot
of
definate
smoke
reminds
me
of
smoked
ham
tastes
like
it
smells
woody
and
smoky
mouthfeel
is
more
on
the
lighter
side
with
good
body
a
good
one
to
try
if
you
like
smoked
meats
or
just
to
experience
a
good
german
smoked
beer
this
is
a
great
representationn
of
a
smoke
flavor
in
its
proper
place
that
enhances
a
beers
flavor
rather
than
act
as
a
cheap
gimmick
would
pair
well
with
some
salmon
but
would
have
difficulty
holding
up
against
most
bbq
sauces
definetly
worth
a
try
especially
if
youve
never
given
a
rauchbier
a
go
serving
type
bottle
the
rauchbier
is
the
style
that
could
easily
be
horrible
if
illtuned
but
this
one
is
right
on
the
money
set
a
pile
of
old
clothes
on
fire
extinguish
it
with
a
bucket
of
water
and
drink
the
runoff
d
not
great
however
over
in
germany
is
was
often
said
that
you
must
have
more
than
one
follow
the
first
with
a
shot
of
schnapps
and
then
it
gets
better
another
excellent
rauchbier
from
the
masters
of
smoked
beer
theres
not
much
more
to
write
other
than
drink
some
pours
a
very
dark
reddish
hue
looks
black
until
you
hold
it
up
to
the
light
solid
2
inch
offwhite
head
leaves
free
form
lacing
while
making
a
hasty
exit
the
aroma
is
almost
exclusively
of
smoked
meats
like
jerky
and
smoked
salmon
more
powerful
than
i
had
anticipated
but
i
like
it
the
taste
is
the
same
very
smoky
and
all
i
can
think
about
is
how
much
i
love
smoked
salmon
this
beer
brings
back
memories
that
have
nothing
to
do
with
beer
i
like
that
there
is
some
definite
hop
bitterness
in
the
middle
and
i
dont
get
any
sweetness
until
the
very
end
very
interesting
brew
love
the
smoke
but
there
is
something
in
the
aftertaste
that
i
wish
would
just
leave
me
alone
something
in
there
just
doesnt
belong
imo
there
is
also
a
slight
abrasiveness
on
the
tongue
but
this
is
still
a
very
good
beer
and
id
definitely
purchase
it
again
if
my
smoketooth
starts
harassing
me
again
cant
help
but
wonder
what
a
touch
of
this
could
do
for
a
nice
homemade
bbq
sauce
or
maybe
a
marinade
overall
im
impressed
to
go
with
the
rauchbier
the
last
time
shrug
d
this
is
the
ultimate
beer
to
enjoy
with
barbeque
as
with
the
style
i
think
it
should
be
enjoyed
sparingly
and
correctly
highly
recommended
aecht
schlenkerla
rauchbier
marzen
was
a
mahogany
in
color
with
an
offwhite
head
the
head
had
decent
retention
and
left
some
lacing
the
aroma
was
dominated
by
smoke
the
taste
was
sweet
malt
with
plenty
of
smoke
with
some
bitterness
towards
the
long
smoky
dry
finish
it
was
medium
bodied
with
fairly
mild
carbonation
drinkability
was
good
its
a
nice
beer
with
a
good
smoke
flavor
its
definately
worth
a
try
oelergud
d
depending
on
ones
desire
to
let
this
go
a
bit
flat
for
a
while
and
then
drink
it
slightly
warmed
down
its
super
and
could
even
be
a
nice
sessionbeer
if
one
could
afford
it
ive
had
smoked
beers
not
even
rauchbiers
that
smell
all
too
much
of
spent
wood
or
ashcans
not
here
though
as
the
smoke
is
deep
rich
and
woody
delivering
the
notable
edge
of
controlled
combustion
on
its
own
its
fairly
drinkable
but
with
virtually
any
assertively
savory
food
it
becomes
a
luscious
companion
so
ill
split
the
difference
and
say
its
plenty
good
and
the
whole
time
its
like
youre
drinking
a
pint
of
brewing
history
overall
i
like
it
i
think
it
would
go
well
with
some
game
meat
stronger
flavoured
cheeses
like
an
aged
white
chedar
too
or
with
kielbasa
my
first
german
rauchbier
and
im
hooked
as
for
drinkability
you
feel
like
you
have
gotten
your
protein
for
the
day
with
just
one
but
it
goes
down
very
easy
would
drink
lots
if
i
could
afford
it
tmd
this
a
really
unique
mouth
feel
big
round
and
smooth
malts
the
beer
is
extremely
easy
to
drink
medium
bodied
and
filling
smokey
and
meaty
almost
a
liquid
beef
jerky
feel
it
is
really
unique
and
wonderful
if
you
dont
like
it
on
first
taste
you
will
appreciate
it
when
you
finish
the
bottle
not
something
for
everyday
but
definitively
something
i
will
return
too
d
if
i
want
a
smokytasting
beer
im
going
for
this
one
really
its
like
no
other
beer
ive
had
even
smoked
malt
porters
come
nowhere
near
this
i
wouldnt
have
this
all
the
time
but
would
definite
recommend
it
for
a
try
under
the
premise
that
its
smoky
it
boured
a
sparkling
red
color
with
a
medium
amount
of
head
from
a
minikeg
it
had
a
salty
smokey
meaty
smell
it
was
downright
baconlike
in
flavor
but
i
wish
had
more
beer
character
i
felt
the
beerflavor
in
this
beer
was
totally
overwhelmed
by
this
bacon
flavor
it
had
a
salty
mouthfeel
like
a
mouthful
of
seawater
not
very
drinkable
overall
drinkability
this
is
one
of
my
favorite
beers
most
people
either
love
it
or
hate
it
if
you
enjoy
smoked
foods
and
dont
mind
this
flavor
in
your
beer
then
this
is
one
to
try
typically
i
will
have
no
more
than
one
in
an
evening
as
any
more
seems
like
too
much
of
a
good
thing
the
smell
is
very
interesting
and
unique
but
it
doesnt
translate
as
well
into
the
flavor
still
nice
and
enjoyable
but
a
bit
excessive
at
times
id
rather
be
eating
that
smoked
ham
right
now
nevertheless
i
still
think
that
this
is
definitely
a
beer
worth
trying
and
id
consider
having
it
again
especially
when
i
had
some
discerning
friends
over
this
is
coming
from
someone
who
loves
black
licorice
so
take
that
as
you
will
if
you
dont
like
schlenkerla
that
just
means
more
for
me
oh
god
what
was
i
thinking
this
is
a
smokebeer
i
dont
know
i
didnt
catch
that
before
i
smelled
and
tasted
like
bacon
i
am
not
a
fan
of
bacon
the
pour
was
ok
it
was
a
light
brown
really
however
the
hint
of
smoke
or
as
i
call
it
bacon
was
just
over
powering
after
my
first
sip
i
was
tempted
to
pour
it
out
however
i
stuck
it
out
and
was
left
with
the
same
feeling
it
wasnt
that
good
pours
a
dark
brown
color
nice
carbonation
nice
two
finger
creamy
head
which
lasts
a
long
time
nice
sticky
lacing
throughout
the
drink
the
nose
is
malty
smoked
big
time
toffee
and
caramel
the
taste
is
malty
smokey
with
nice
touch
of
caramel
medium
body
drinkable
the
taste
reminds
me
of
sardines
so
because
of
this
i
would
not
buy
again
500ml
bottle
purchased
from
lcbo
in
toronto
pours
a
clear
medium
brown
with
no
head
and
a
bit
of
carbonation
aroma
reminiscent
of
a
smoky
fireplace
taste
is
of
malts
quickly
replaced
by
a
smoky
aftertaste
which
is
not
as
dominating
as
i
was
fearing
the
beer
went
down
pretty
nicely
in
the
end
and
i
must
admit
i
was
a
bit
terrified
about
drinking
this
one
based
on
some
of
the
reviews
i
read
on
the
other
hand
my
wife
just
told
me
that
i
smell
like
cigarettes
not
my
cup
of
tea
or
pack
of
smokes
but
interesting
to
try
would
love
to
see
what
their
smoky
weizen
is
like
bham
uk
taste
follows
through
with
the
nose
although
there
is
a
rich
porterlike
quality
of
mild
hops
barley
and
molasses
mouthfeel
is
excellent
full
creamy
without
being
cloying
and
smooth
without
being
watery
drinkability
is
high
although
this
style
might
not
agree
with
everyone
and
i
think
about
1
beer
will
do
it
for
me
because
of
the
intensity
for
the
style
though
this
is
a
very
good
bier
pours
mahoganyred
with
a
loose
ring
of
a
head
on
it
jerky
and
smoke
odor
is
weaker
than
expected
taste
is
spicy
meaty
beef
and
smoked
gouda
a
little
bitter
kind
of
like
drinking
water
that
several
cigars
have
been
extinguished
in
if
you
can
imagine
that
in
a
good
way
drinkable
because
its
interesting
enough
to
keep
drinking
it
but
not
too
weird
to
make
you
want
to
stop
dark
cloudy
brown
pour
small
bubbly
head
aromas
dominated
by
a
citrusy
hickory
smokiness
some
malt
present
but
fleeting
taste
was
surprisingly
fruity
great
malt
flavor
in
the
background
while
the
smoke
wasnt
overdone
no
unpleasant
aftertaste
though
i
would
have
liked
some
more
hop
flavor
to
balance
the
malt
almost
like
a
stout
in
its
mouthfeel
smooth
silky
and
slightly
carbonated
very
easy
going
down
but
like
most
most
smoked
beers
the
palate
suffers
from
overload
after
a
few
of
these
dark
but
translucent
with
nice
red
and
brown
hues
slight
head
nose
is
smoky
oily
malts
taste
is
pleasant
like
nice
roasted
coffee
beans
and
toasted
smoky
malts
mouthfeel
is
good
and
so
is
drinkability
good
beer
for
the
style
id
like
to
marinate
some
fish
in
this
stuff
the
taste
is
sweet
and
smoky
at
the
same
time
it
reminds
me
of
the
smoked
salmon
you
get
in
slices
at
home
i
suppose
this
would
go
with
a
cuisine
like
that
or
to
balance
out
a
sweet
dessert
taste
is
liquid
jerky
a
bit
of
alcohol
chewy
yet
smooth
is
not
as
thick
as
it
looks
or
smells
drank
very
well
good
for
pairing
with
grilled
meats
id
imagine
aecht
schlenkerla
rauchbier
marzen
pours
a
dark
copper
color
with
a
tan
head
from
a
brown
50
cl
bottle
the
aroma
is
dominated
by
smoke
the
flavor
is
also
quite
smoky
as
one
of
my
friends
put
it
it
tastes
like
the
drippings
from
a
barbeque
that
may
be
a
bit
of
an
exageration
but
it
sure
is
smoky
i
think
you
either
like
this
beer
or
you
dont
there
probably
isnt
a
lot
of
room
to
be
on
the
fence
on
this
one
i
like
it
if
you
like
smoke
beers
this
is
definitely
one
you
should
try
drinkability
is
quite
good
and
this
is
the
one
rauchbier
i
would
suggest
for
someone
new
to
them
or
even
for
a
bmc
drinker
probably
a
perfect
barbecue
beer
cook
with
the
urbock
and
drink
this
one
pours
out
a
clear
brown
that
turns
more
rusty
when
put
to
the
light
head
is
far
from
exceptional
but
is
made
up
of
a
series
of
fine
bubbles
smell
is
initially
of
smoked
ham
but
underneath
it
all
is
malty
and
clean
like
a
good
lager
as
with
the
aroma
with
the
taste
the
flavor
is
at
first
a
punch
of
smoke
but
there
is
depth
to
the
malt
that
holds
its
own
bready
and
nutty
with
a
faint
noble
hop
appearance
finishes
clean
with
a
nice
bitter
kick
mouthfeel
isnt
very
heavy
and
the
carbonation
is
mellow
great
session
i
like
this
way
better
than
the
urbock
this
is
the
most
drinkable
schlenkerla
that
ive
tried
so
far
and
my
favorite
rauchbier
to
date
this
paired
very
well
with
some
pepperjack
cheese
but
im
really
looking
forward
to
bringing
it
along
to
a
bbq
d
an
easytodrink
beer
the
smoke
is
a
nice
finish
that
does
not
overpower
the
tastebuds
a
nice
beer
to
drink
in
front
of
a
fireplace
or
just
to
get
in
a
rustic
mood
this
beer
pours
a
clear
ruby
red
color
the
head
is
three
finger
in
height
and
recedes
very
slowly
into
thick
lacing
the
aroma
is
like
a
camp
fire
all
smokey
and
warm
the
taste
isnt
nearly
as
smokey
as
the
aroma
but
is
still
heavily
so
the
smoke
however
is
balanced
out
nicely
my
malt
the
mouthfeel
is
a
touch
lighter
than
medium
bodied
with
nice
carbonation
overall
this
is
a
fine
rauchbier
that
i
will
certainly
have
again
ill
have
another
drinkability
is
good
i
think
the
smoke
beer
is
a
bit
of
an
acquired
taste
and
probably
not
for
everyone
but
im
enjoying
it
overall
this
would
go
good
with
some
smoke
cheese
and
some
beef
unless
you
like
smoke
beers
this
is
a
try
beer
wavz
drinkablity
its
awesome
not
the
most
drinkable
beer
but
well
worth
a
try
this
also
paired
very
nicely
with
homemade
smoked
barbeque
ribs
d
easy
to
drink
perfect
pairing
with
smoked
meats
i
love
it
with
sausage
like
all
other
hellertrum
rauchbiers
if
you
know
what
youre
getting
into
love
barbecued
food
enough
to
drink
it
or
want
a
completely
new
beer
experience
try
this
rauchbier
personally
it
was
a
little
too
much
for
me
to
handle
and
has
probably
made
me
gun
shy
toward
other
rauchbiers
out
there
ill
stick
to
the
american
smoked
this
is
a
beer
that
begs
to
be
consumed
with
food
its
a
most
unique
style
this
would
obviously
pair
well
with
smoked
foods
like
salmon
bbq
ribs
and
grilled
sausage
the
style
is
probably
an
acquired
taste
and
i
think
it
takes
a
few
times
to
get
it
but
once
you
do
wow
its
amazing
drinkablity
this
is
one
unique
brew
and
a
superior
example
of
the
rouchbier
marzen
style
this
beer
would
pair
great
with
smoked
fish
like
mullet
or
grilled
shark
steaks
as
well
as
any
smoked
or
meats
grilled
over
wood
coals
the
clerk
at
grapes
and
hops
where
i
picked
this
up
said
of
this
beer
that
you
either
love
it
or
hate
it
im
kind
of
ambivilant
about
it
i
think
im
more
in
the
like
category
this
is
amazingly
different
and
tasty
but
not
really
for
everyday
consumption
i
also
feel
a
coronary
coming
on
from
just
tasting
this
brew
only
for
the
adventurous
and
carnivorous
but
they
shall
be
rewarded
this
is
a
great
accompaniment
to
a
smoked
sausage
or
other
meats
a
nice
fall
barbecue
beer
ive
had
it
alone
and
its
good
for
what
it
is
can
be
a
bit
much
but
to
complement
the
right
food
its
very
good
while
not
a
session
beer
this
will
certainly
make
a
regular
appearance
in
my
cellar
its
very
drinkable
even
with
such
a
robust
smokiness
this
would
be
beautiful
to
drink
while
eating
some
rare
beef
poured
into
my
quasistange
a
14ounce
explum
jam
jar
my
bottle
is
labeled
as
containing
5
1
abv
a
negligible
difference
from
the
5
4
stated
on
this
website
clear
dark
russet
with
a
lumpy
cloud
of
khaki
foam
smells
unmistakably
like
a
toasted
sandwich
with
shaved
smoked
ham
and
melty
smoked
gouda
god
i
bet
that
sandwich
would
pair
superbly
with
this
beer
deeper
whiffs
reveal
a
bit
of
a
worty
malt
scent
but
really
the
only
aroma
that
matters
here
is
the
smell
of
meaty
smoke
this
smoked
pork
flavor
powerfully
introduces
the
taste
and
lingers
throughout
the
middle
of
the
sip
at
which
point
the
faint
hops
and
bready
malt
flavor
of
the
maerzen
beer
comes
through
briefly
then
a
rather
strong
mineral
taste
seeps
in
lasts
through
the
finish
and
then
disappears
in
a
cloudy
smoky
aftertaste
that
lasts
about
half
a
minute
sticky
webs
of
lacing
hang
about
after
a
bit
the
smoke
flavor
takes
on
more
of
a
been
breathing
through
my
mouth
at
a
campfire
character
medium
body
slightly
chewy
overall
dry
mouthfeel
this
is
really
unlike
any
other
beer
ive
ever
tasted
ive
had
smoked
porters
before
but
they
aint
got
nothin
on
the
smokiness
of
this
specimen
its
truly
fascinating
it
strikes
me
as
something
id
only
crave
from
time
to
time
and
only
on
certain
occasions
nevertheless
i
could
see
this
beer
really
growing
on
some
folks
palates
and
becoming
a
regular
choice
for
everyday
drinking
simply
put
a
fascinating
beer
this
beer
poured
a
very
dark
amberbrown
with
a
thick
tan
head
it
definitely
smelled
of
sweet
smoke
and
slightly
malty
the
taste
is
malty
and
sweet
with
a
heavy
smoke
flavor
the
mouthfeel
is
full
but
not
chewy
this
is
far
more
drinkable
than
i
was
expecting
in
a
smoked
beer
and
id
consider
it
highly
drinkable
it
a
very
tasty
beer
but
i
think
it
would
be
best
to
save
this
one
for
the
right
occasions
not
really
a
session
beer
this
beer
is
fairly
dark
and
there
was
a
thin
head
the
smell
features
the
smoke
flavor
prominatly
as
does
the
taste
the
style
profile
states
this
type
of
beer
may
taste
like
smoked
meat
and
this
is
evident
as
well
this
beer
tastes
like
smoked
salmon
the
mouthfeel
is
fairly
smooth
and
the
drinkability
is
good
a
very
different
type
of
beer
a
clear
dark
copper
pour
with
some
crimson
highlights
makes
for
a
unique
color
fine
offwhite
head
persists
rather
nicely
the
dominant
smell
is
of
smokethe
real
sort
of
wood
smoke
that
evokes
an
open
fire
or
heavily
smoked
bacon
sweet
malts
peek
through
a
bit
as
well
taste
starts
out
with
a
sweet
maltiness
that
quickly
bows
to
a
smokiness
that
is
full
and
rich
but
not
overly
assertive
especially
for
this
style
dry
in
the
finish
with
a
pleasant
crispness
the
mouthfeel
is
nicely
balanced
for
such
an
unbalanced
beernot
too
chewy
or
clingy
but
not
too
crisp
to
betray
the
malty
foundation
of
the
style
more
drinkable
than
i
would
have
expected
even
when
compared
to
beers
outside
the
style
a
good
choice
and
certainly
worth
getting
again
not
to
mention
this
would
make
a
premium
marinade
this
is
my
first
ever
rauchbier
and
i
have
to
say
its
a
very
unique
style
it
would
most
likely
be
an
exellent
choice
to
pair
with
a
hearty
meaty
meal
overall
a
very
interesting
beer
i
wouldnt
call
it
drinkable
just
too
much
smoke
taste
to
drink
too
many
also
very
important
to
match
with
the
right
food
certainly
some
bbq
or
a
good
hamburger
would
work
drinkabilitynotes
excellent
and
very
drinkable
the
smoke
notes
are
somewhat
restrained
quite
distinctive
absolutley
delicious
i
have
had
quite
a
lot
of
the
urbock
but
this
is
by
first
baptising
in
märzen
i
feel
this
smoke
flavour
profile
is
much
much
stronger
in
this
than
the
urbock
it
poured
about
the
same
colour
a
brownish
red
bronze
with
a
slight
chill
haze
and
off
white
head
that
dissolved
in
a
few
seconds
leaving
a
lovely
looking
blanket
of
frost
about
the
surface
smell
was
camp
fire
smoke
bacon
and
sweet
malts
such
as
one
would
expect
from
a
good
oktoberfest
bier
such
as
paulaner
taste
was
more
smoke
and
a
bit
drier
than
the
urbock
with
less
sweet
of
a
finish
than
the
urbock
as
well
i
think
i
prefer
this
to
the
urbock
which
unfortunately
i
have
easier
access
to
than
this
mouthfeel
is
very
smooth
with
a
great
weight
to
be
a
märzen
even
with
the
smoke
rauchbier
would
easily
be
in
my
top
five
favourite
styles
and
i
believe
i
just
found
my
favourite
rauchbier
wunderbar
now
im
not
usually
a
fan
of
marzens
but
when
its
coupled
with
this
bombastic
smoked
flavor
its
much
better
to
me
the
sweet
smooth
crisp
marzen
flavor
definitely
is
there
but
its
overshadowed
by
the
smokiness
which
enhances
it
i
think
ill
definitely
be
trying
more
of
these
rauchbiers
in
the
very
near
future
pours
crystal
clear
mahogany
with
half
inch
of
creamy
head
that
slowly
recedes
to
film
and
medium
lace
smells
fragrantly
smoky
a
bit
greasy
grainy
light
malt
sweetness
on
the
front
of
the
tongue
slightly
chewy
grains
in
the
center
finishes
with
very
clean
and
appetizing
smokiness
that
isnt
overwhelming
the
dichotomy
between
the
smoke
and
cool
clean
finish
is
shocking
at
first
but
quite
mouthwatering
after
a
few
sips
taste
light
and
wellbalanced
between
cream
and
carbonation
my
favorite
of
the
hellertrum
beers
so
far
delicious
and
easydrinking
mouthfeel
is
ultrasmooth
with
a
nicely
sweet
malt
backbone
that
is
surrounded
by
the
sensation
of
smoked
ham
bits
that
appear
in
cambells
soup
bean
w
bacon
comes
to
mind
i
tried
this
about
two
years
ago
and
poured
the
bottle
down
the
drain
considering
it
undrinkable
fast
forward
to
today
and
i
find
it
amazing
one
of
the
smoothest
beers
ive
encountered
while
the
smoke
and
malt
sweetness
pair
nicely
pours
mediumtodark
brown
wtih
about
34finger
head
only
two
apparent
smells
are
dark
roasted
malt
and
smoked
pork
you
may
think
you
dont
want
your
beer
smelling
like
meat
but
this
ones
kosher
believe
me
thin
and
watery
on
the
tongue
moderate
carbonation
the
smoke
flavor
picks
up
immediately
before
youve
even
had
a
chance
to
swallow
tastes
almost
entirely
of
smoky
roasted
malt
almost
no
hop
presence
whatsoever
nor
any
trace
of
meat
flavoring
thank
whomever
altogether
extremely
smoky
but
not
in
a
burnt
sort
of
way
i
could
probably
drink
a
number
of
these
in
one
sitting
maybe
not
quite
a
session
beer
but
something
that
i
can
imagine
myself
jonesing
for
in
the
future
mouthfeel
is
a
bit
on
the
thin
side
but
the
drinkability
is
higher
than
i
was
expecting
this
is
only
the
second
true
rauchbier
that
ive
had
and
i
cant
believe
how
good
it
is
i
have
a
couple
more
different
ones
to
sample
and
now
i
cant
wait
to
try
them
overall
a
fairly
drinkable
beer
quite
drinkable
for
a
rauch
and
entirely
inoffensive
marzen
the
workingmans
rauchbier
drinkable
not
as
complex
in
development
as
the
schlenkerla
bock
but
this
is
definitely
a
drinkable
and
sessionable
rauchbier
lighter
flavors
showcase
the
smoke
but
facilitate
easy
consumption
i
prefer
the
flavor
of
the
urbock
but
admire
the
easydrinking
agreeableness
of
this
beer
a
damn
fine
brew
worth
a
trip
to
bamberg
on
its
own
3
59
16
9
oz
wider
brown
euro
style
bottle
i
sniffed
thinking
that
it
was
alot
like
smoked
salmon
and
took
a
sip
not
bad
like
an
overly
smokey
bbq
with
some
tobacco
and
ashy
backgrounds
thought
that
it
would
require
some
more
sweetness
or
complexity
in
there
to
make
it
more
drinkable
nice
to
sample
dont
know
if
ill
be
coming
back
to
it
it
would
make
an
excellent
backbone
to
a
bbq
sauce
d
really
good
stuff
drank
the
second
half
of
it
with
some
smoked
cheddar
which
worked
well
i
could
see
how
this
would
be
great
with
bbqed
meat
we
did
however
put
the
beer
to
good
use
as
a
marinade
for
our
barbecued
chicken
now
that
i
can
handle
this
is
great
i
wish
there
were
more
smoked
beers
around
ive
been
drinking
them
up
lately
but
there
arent
many
others
guess
ill
have
to
buy
this
whenever
i
want
a
smoke
fix
zum
wohl
mk
overall
this
is
an
interesting
beer
i
dont
think
id
like
to
drink
a
lot
of
this
straight
up
however
i
think
the
flavors
in
this
beer
will
be
excellent
to
cook
with
this
pours
a
clear
dark
brown
with
a
small
tan
head
that
disappears
quickly
the
smell
is
a
smoked
wood
bbq
aroma
that
makes
your
mouth
water
the
taste
is
a
mesquite
wood
bbq
this
is
like
liquid
babyback
ribs
malt
and
molasses
are
also
in
this
beer
its
almost
like
a
bbq
sauce
the
mf
is
medium
with
the
flavors
all
mixing
well
a
wonderful
tasting
and
smelling
beer
for
summer
bbqs
bring
on
the
ribs
overall
i
liked
this
beer
fairly
well
id
recommend
trying
it
at
least
once
and
id
love
to
have
it
again
with
some
smoked
babyback
ribs
not
something
id
want
to
enjoy
over
and
over
again
though
i
rated
drinkability
as
3
0
only
because
im
too
much
a
virgin
to
drink
more
of
this
tonight
but
i
will
try
it
again
and
probably
rerate
when
my
tongue
grows
up
the
mouthfeel
is
overall
ive
been
really
anxious
to
try
a
rauchbier
since
i
love
the
smoke
flavors
in
beer
i
was
not
dissapointed
at
all
however
i
was
dissapointed
that
i
didnt
pick
up
the
other
two
versions
of
this
beer
while
this
may
not
be
everyones
favorite
beer
its
definitely
unique
and
something
every
beer
lover
should
at
least
try
drinkability
i
wont
finish
this
bottle
this
is
either
a
taste
i
have
not
yet
acquired
or
the
beer
itself
just
isnt
enjoyable
enough
ill
likely
try
the
style
again
in
the
future
to
see
if
i
like
it
more
but
this
one
is
mediocre
at
best
hand
carried
back
from
kansas
city
mo
and
if
you
do
get
some
make
sure
you
buy
an
extra
bottle
to
cook
with
the
lady
friend
is
making
some
bbq
sauce
as
we
speak
with
it
thats
awesome
the
first
taste
was
good
but
it
did
not
taste
as
smokey
as
it
smelled
it
had
a
nice
malt
flavor
with
little
to
no
hops
it
was
thicker
than
normal
and
had
a
fairly
nice
mouthfeel
the
smell
and
the
taste
just
seemed
very
different
should
give
it
a
try
if
you
have
never
had
a
smokey
beer
it
is
very
interesting
overall
as
far
as
smoked
beers
go
this
one
kicks
ass
i
cant
say
ive
had
one
like
this
definetly
worth
trying
at
least
for
the
novelty
of
it
drinkability
when
i
first
took
a
sip
of
this
i
thought
man
this
is
good
but
im
not
sure
i
can
finish
it
but
the
more
i
drink
the
more
i
like
this
i
wouldnt
mind
having
another
and
i
really
look
forward
to
pairing
this
with
meats
d
still
very
smokey
a
little
overwhelming
i
couldnt
drink
many
of
these
give
this
one
a
try
mouthfeel
is
medium
to
full
not
as
heavy
as
its
sister
beer
drinkability
is
excellent
the
lighter
mouthfeel
and
meaty
smoke
flavor
makes
this
one
unique
and
highly
quaffable
i
really
like
this
just
dont
know
how
often
ill
pick
it
up
ive
been
sitting
on
this
one
for
a
while
i
paid
just
under
3
00
for
a
1
pint
9
oz
bottle
and
poured
it
into
a
pint
glass
it
looked
kind
of
like
an
english
brown
ale
reddish
brown
and
clear
with
a
thick
tan
foam
on
top
but
the
smell
was
way
different
smelled
like
a
camp
fire
more
than
anything
but
also
a
little
like
smoked
ham
it
doesnt
sound
right
for
a
beer
but
it
worked
for
me
tasted
smoky
and
malty
and
was
very
carbonated
from
now
on
ill
recommend
everyone
tries
this
at
least
once
finally
got
my
hands
on
a
rauchbier
i
saw
their
lager
at
the
store
and
woulda
bought
it
as
well
if
i
had
known
that
so
few
people
had
reviewed
it
anyway
from
a
big
german
bottle
into
a
german
mug
it
pours
a
rich
deep
copper
with
very
active
carbonation
and
an
inch
of
khaki
head
that
consists
mostly
of
small
bubbles
and
retains
a
quarter
inch
throughout
leaving
some
nice
patchesrings
of
lace
the
aroma
is
very
smoky
from
the
beginning
i
can
smell
the
wood
they
used
and
the
aroma
reminds
me
of
a
good
smoked
meat
or
cheese
by
the
end
there
are
notes
of
faint
hops
and
clean
malts
and
the
smoke
seems
to
be
sweeter
if
that
makes
sense
the
first
sip
kickstarts
my
bacon
craving
which
by
end
becomes
a
smoked
salmon
craving
the
taste
is
highly
smoky
at
the
start
with
notes
of
spices
but
i
soon
find
notes
of
faint
coffee
and
green
almost
citric
hops
with
a
mild
to
medium
bitterness
that
intensifies
as
i
progress
as
does
a
tobacco
flavor
which
leaves
the
taste
of
chaw
in
my
mouth
the
mouthfeel
is
medium
to
full
and
incredibly
smooth
and
creamy
for
a
lager
leaving
a
long
finish
that
makes
me
want
another
bottle
it
is
surprisingly
drinkable
as
i
was
a
bit
hesitant
of
the
style
but
it
is
a
wonderful
beer
that
is
totally
unique
to
my
palate
i
must
try
their
other
offerings
a
great
deal
at
under
4
a
bottle
i
have
been
pretty
fearful
of
smokebeers
until
now
and
it
turns
out
that
this
one
at
least
is
better
than
id
hoped
yes
it
has
a
frightening
smell
of
smoke
and
meat
but
its
surprisingly
quaffable
verdict
a
very
tasty
example
of
a
unique
style
recommended
d
after
hearing
a
lot
of
buzz
about
these
beers
in
the
forums
ive
finally
popped
my
rauchbier
cherry
and
couldnt
be
happier
the
character
of
this
beer
is
incredibly
unique
im
drinking
this
beer
by
itself
now
and
loving
it
but
i
cant
wait
to
try
this
with
something
off
the
grill
pours
a
clear
mahoganey
with
ruby
edges
and
a
small
light
tan
head
smell
hmmm
woah
the
nose
is
smoked
bacon
on
a
crisp
canadian
morning
i
reckon
with
a
side
of
eggs
and
some
strong
coffee
well
be
able
to
hunt
moose
and
fish
walleye
all
day
amazingly
strong
smoked
meat
aromas
faint
caramel
malt
in
there
but
the
smoke
covers
all
else
luckily
i
like
smoked
meats
smoked
prosciutto
flavors
greet
the
mouth
alongside
caramelized
carrots
and
faint
malt
sweetness
ham
and
campfire
smoke
throughout
more
sweetness
detectable
in
the
long
smoky
finish
mediumbodied
with
a
surprisingly
lively
feel
not
liquid
smoke
just
really
smoky
and
delicious
beer
this
one
is
awesome
on
tap
from
a
5
liter
minikeg
that
was
22
at
shangys
in
emmaus
this
one
kicks
ass
dark
amber
in
colour
with
a
lovely
cascading
head
of
foam
that
lasts
and
is
thick
and
rich
in
itself
aromas
of
smoked
malts
and
all
things
smoke
as
well
as
fruity
balance
and
intriguing
malt
complexity
sure
its
smoky
but
it
is
most
certainly
not
one
dimensional
taste
is
smoky
fruity
and
malty
with
a
nice
bread
character
to
it
as
well
drinkability
is
awesome
mouthfeel
is
medium
bodied
and
lovely
with
very
lively
carbonation
i
love
this
beer
and
this
brewery
very
much
these
days
flavor
is
smokey
and
meaty
salty
too
almost
chewy
more
than
one
of
these
would
make
me
taste
terrible
poor
anna
but
still
very
palatable
all
the
flavors
really
linger
in
the
mouth
and
i
can
still
taste
it
well
after
the
sip
very
full
flavorkind
of
takes
over
the
head
id
be
wary
of
getting
to
close
to
the
girlfriend
after
drinking
one
of
these
but
still
quite
tasty
moderate
pour
into
my
23
ounce
pilsner
glass
yields
a
nice
2finger
offwhite
head
over
a
clear
mahogany
body
head
fades
to
a
solid
ring
with
nice
lacing
aroma
of
smoked
malt
deer
sausage
some
piney
hops
toasted
sourdough
bread
smoked
almonds
fascinating
the
taste
is
a
nice
marzen
light
bitterness
with
some
floral
hop
notes
the
smokiness
is
not
as
pronounced
as
in
the
aroma
or
as
in
the
rauchbier
urbock
its
more
in
the
background
nice
toasted
malt
notes
with
some
pine
hops
then
the
smoke
is
in
the
aftertaste
very
pleasant
mouthfeel
is
clean
and
crisp
like
a
marzen
should
be
at
5
4
this
is
very
drinkable
but
i
lowered
the
mark
because
of
the
price
i
am
really
happy
that
my
friend
put
this
in
my
cart
at
the
beer
store
this
is
a
fantastic
brew
i
love
bbq
and
think
this
would
pair
fantastically
with
some
good
slow
smoked
bbq
pork
ribs
but
the
beer
tastes
like
a
meal
in
itself
though
too
i
wish
they
carried
this
at
dinosaur
bbq
i
will
definitely
seek
out
more
beers
of
this
style
great
stuff
this
rauchbier
d
as
delicious
as
this
is
its
way
too
heavy
to
be
any
kind
of
session
brew
a
special
occasion
showofftoyourfriends
sort
of
beer
alsohard
to
find
around
here
this
is
a
fun
beer
rich
smokey
aroma
and
flavor
not
for
the
faint
at
heart
makes
me
think
of
nc
bbqeastern
great
food
beer
especially
with
smoked
meats
not
something
to
quench
your
thirst
with
after
mowing
the
lawn
dont
be
a
wuss
go
try
this
beer
drinkable
but
i
cant
imagine
drinking
many
of
these
and
only
with
the
right
food
surprisingly
complex
really
a
lovely
beer
a
better
understanding
of
the
style
would
probably
give
me
a
greater
appreciation
for
this
beer
this
has
to
be
the
most
fascinating
things
ive
ever
had
being
the
first
rauchbier
ive
had
im
very
very
fascinated
this
looks
good
dark
brown
with
a
nice
amount
of
lacing
smell
is
like
campfire
with
hints
of
a
smoked
sausage
totally
delicious
taste
is
absolutely
phenomenal
this
would
go
so
so
well
with
a
side
of
summer
sausage
carbonation
is
just
right
and
delivers
the
aromas
just
perfectly
drinkability
is
pretty
good
but
for
some
the
aftertaste
might
be
a
bit
too
much
personally
this
ranks
among
the
best
ive
ever
tasted
very
unique
and
quite
flavorful
im
getting
some
of
these
next
time
i
have
a
barbecue
overall
an
exceptional
example
of
this
style
highly
recommended
its
better
to
state
this
from
the
beginning
i
prefer
my
cured
meats
on
the
side
and
not
in
the
brew
the
rauchbier
poured
with
two
fingers
of
beige
foam
it
has
a
nice
brown
color
and
smells
of
cured
meats
and
burned
wood
the
taste
is
smokey
of
cured
meats
and
some
metal
with
a
bitter
bite
of
hops
in
the
end
it
has
a
creamy
mouthfeel
although
it
feels
a
bit
weird
to
drink
i
think
it
is
an
interesting
beer
but
drinking
it
will
never
be
a
habit
of
mine
i
have
had
this
many
times
before
but
each
time
it
is
such
an
intense
experience
poured
a
nice
deep
brown
with
a
slight
head
which
dissipated
fairly
quickly
but
of
course
the
aroma
and
taste
are
the
headliners
here
i
always
associate
this
with
the
smoked
gouda
i
love
only
more
intense
i
think
the
smoked
flavor
overwhelms
the
other
elements
slightly
in
this
one
theres
probably
a
better
balance
in
the
urbock
version
but
i
guess
thats
the
point
the
carbonation
acts
well
with
the
highmedium
texture
to
make
it
an
enjoyable
treat
in
moderation
i
would
probably
only
drink
one
ideally
paired
with
a
big
tray
of
sausages
and
cheese
i
am
enjoying
this
with
a
bit
of
smoked
turkey
on
oregano
triscuits
perfect
combination
i
must
say
would
definitely
go
well
with
smoked
bbq
sandwich
or
smoked
kilbasa
sausage
this
is
one
incredible
beer
reminds
me
of
my
german
heritage
one
of
the
worlds
finest
range
of
brews
and
this
is
one
of
the
picks
of
the
bunch
in
my
book
you
havent
really
drank
beer
until
youve
had
at
least
one
of
these
beauties
whether
you
end
up
liking
it
or
not
in
my
all
time
top
10
easy
its
ok
looks
good
smells
pretty
much
as
expected
etc
etc
in
general
an
interesting
rauchbier
but
not
distinguished
enough
for
me
just
better
than
average
in
most
regards
but
still
just
a
run
of
the
mill
brew
as
far
as
im
concerned
drinkability
well
you
either
dig
the
smoke
or
not
this
was
my
first
rauchbier
and
i
love
the
change
of
pace
i
can
really
appreciate
this
style
however
wouldnt
picture
myself
drinking
more
than
a
couple
of
these
just
yet
i
didnt
drop
the
drinkability
of
this
beer
too
much
since
its
supposed
to
taste
like
it
does
but
i
sure
couldnt
drink
a
lot
of
them
or
even
more
than
one
really
definitely
worth
trying
but
i
dont
think
im
a
big
fan
and
i
definitely
prefer
the
lighter
more
complex
bieropholie
calumet
reviewed
earlier
a
very
nice
and
wellbalanced
rauchbier
a
bit
tame
for
the
styleid
give
it
to
someone
whos
never
had
a
smoky
beer
before
to
help
ease
them
in
i
think
every
ba
should
try
this
one
or
a
comparable
rauch
its
about
broadening
our
experiences
afterall
the
taste
might
be
jarring
at
first
but
i
think
that
once
you
get
over
the
initial
shock
youll
realize
that
its
a
reasonably
smooth
beer
drinkabilty
i
like
the
smoked
taste
but
i
dont
know
if
i
could
drink
more
than
one
of
these
at
a
time
very
good
nonetheless
the
flavour
was
a
little
dissapointing
compared
to
the
smell
sure
it
was
very
smokey
with
a
rich
malty
almost
caramel
character
to
it
but
just
not
what
i
was
expecting
had
a
nice
lingering
malt
and
smoke
flavour
with
the
smoke
dominating
very
easy
drinking
sadly
not
as
good
as
rauchenfelser
on
the
funny
side
the
bar
manager
came
out
to
see
if
we
were
enjoying
our
meals
sees
that
tease
is
drinking
the
rauch
and
says
something
like
wow
youre
brave
a
very
strong
flavoured
beer
im
not
too
keen
on
it
myself
i
prefer
a
little
less
smoke
than
this
but
why
would
i
complain
and
along
with
its
brothers
the
urbock
and
weizen
but
its
worth
trying

appearance
is
really
dark
with
absolutely
no

penetration
the
smell
is
very
original
almost
like
bbq
pork
the
taste
is
the
same
way
i
have
never
tried
a
beer
like
this
and
its
amazing
it
is
almost
like
bbq

meat
you
can
tell
the
smoke
that
went
into
this
beer
thats
about
all
i
can
say
about
the
taste
its
that
if
you
have
never
had
a
rauchbier
before
this
will
be
a
real
treat
pours
a
deep

a
big
frothy

this
beer
smells
like
a
midsummer
pig
roast
like
a
well
seasoned
brisket
bacon
frying
easter
ham
the
smoke
is
overwhelming
not
even
a
hint
of
anything
else
magnificent
i
didnt
even
want
to
drink
this
beer
just
swirl
it
in
the
snifter
for
hours
tastes
just
like
the
nose
all
smoke
with
just
a
little
sweetness
and
a
subtle
sort
of
metallic
tang
medium
body
fits
this
beer
to
a
t
highly
drinkable

i
would
have
like
a

its
still
really
nice
o
the
carbonated
version
of
this
beer
is
pretty
good
but
nitro
makes
this
brew
great
i
find
that
carbon
dioxide
can
make
smokiness
taste
slightly
acrid
much
like
getting
campfire
smoke
in
your

but
the

lets
the

give
the
beer
extra

i
havent
had
a
beer
from

that
wasnt
above

this
is
not
an
exception
it
is
not
my
favorite
beer
from
jacks
abby
but
it
is
still
worth
repeating
outstanding
closest
thing
to
an
authentic
german
smoked
lager
yet
overall
nice
smokey
black
lager
ill
revisit
this
one
again
in
the
future
overall
a
good
beer
in
the
style
rauchbeer
this
is
a
very
tasty
rauchbier
black
lager
according
to
ja
eminently
drinkable
and
approachable
a
great
choice
for
a
slightly
darker
beer
on
a
hot
day
o
this
is
a
great
treat
beer
i
would
absolutely
buy
this
any
day
a
little
involved
of
a
beer
for
a
hot
day
and
a
little
thin
to
be
a
great
winter
beer
hell
of
an
autumn
beer
though
i
would
equate
this
almost
to
a
brown
alelight
porter
just
beautiful
stuff
a
love
how
much
complexity
they
could
squeeze
into
this
beer
o
this
beer
to
me
is
schwarzbier
and
rauchbier
this
combination
works
so
well
here
in
smoke
dagger
drinkable
and
with
tons
of
flavor
this
could
be
a
great
session
beer
the
unique
profile
of
this
beer
makes
it
ripe
for
some
great
food
parings
if
you
see
this
give
it
a
try
o
great

highly

murky

subtle

the
taste
is
really
drinkable
with
light
smokiness
a
bit
of
dark
cherry
more
chocolatey
malt
and
a
dry
roasty
bitter
finish
smooth
and
soft
in

with
just
enough

really
easy

and

quite

the

me
pitch

with
just
a
hint
of
ruby
on
the
edges
aromas
of
roasted
coffee
and
dark

nibs
very
nice
balance
of
hoppy
character
and
malty
sweetness
its
bitter
coffee
up
front
and
a
clean
crisp
finish
that
leaves
a
resiny
hops
bite
on
the
back
palate
the
description
of
it
being
a
cross
between
a
rauch
and
a
schwartzbier
is
apt
the
smokiness
is
there
especially
on
the
nose
but
its
not
all
in
your
face
the
flavor
and
body
are
much
more
schwarzbier
o
a
very
well
crafter
beer
with
an
excellent
balance
of
flavors
the
smoke
flavor
builds
as
you
enjoy
the
beer
but
the
other
elements
come
through
as
well
the
brew
combined
the
best
elements
of
smoked
porter
and
schwarzerbier
fun
beer
from
jacks
abby
sort
of
a
cross
between
a
schwarz
and
a
rauchbier
being
a
darker
smoked
lager
type
medium
brown
color
to
this
with
great
carbonation
a
one
inch
off
white
head
and
picture
perfect
ring
lacing
as
it
drinks
the
nose
is
not
as
smoked
as
i
anticipated
more
spiced
than
smoked
really
with
some
chocolate
malt
and
a
range
of
other
well
toasted
grains
lager
yeast
abounds
the
flavor
is
still
only
lightly
smoked
subtle
especially
in
a
rauchbier
context
darker
malt
gives
some
earthy
character
without
a
ton
of
sweetness
and
there
is
an
astonishing
lack
of
body
for
the
color
a
really
nice
feature
lending
to
drinkability
well
carbonated
and
the
finish
is
light
smoke
and
wintery
spice
a
nice
combination
not
much
hops
though
but
they
arent
really
missed
i
like
that
complexity
of
this
especially
for
a
lager
jacks
abby
has
really
redefined
what
it
means
to
be
a
lager
and
beers
like
this
are
a
perfect
example
of
their
crusade
against
convention
this
beer
is
done
right
in
pretty
much
every
way
the
smoke
is
very
subtle
but
detectable
the
body
is
a
perfect
balance
of
dry
sweet
and
thick
its
not
too
bitter
or
over
hopped
to
me
this
is
like
a
single
strength
plead
the
fifth
with
a
hint
of
smoke
its
become
a
regular
buy
for
me
and
deserves
more
than
the
88
score
that
it
had
at
the
time
of
my
review
o
excellent
beer
this
is
an
incredibly
smooth
full
flavored
and
balanced
beer
it
has
the
smoothness
of
a
black
lager
with
the
touches
of
a
porter
overall
this
is
a
tasty
brew
with
smoke
quality
that
pairs
nicely
with
the
roasted
malts
the
palate
opens
with
a
blend
dark
chocolate
smoke
and
a
little
coffee
dark
caramel
sweetness
is
present
along
with
a
robust
bitterness
the
label
mentions
that
this
skirts
the
line
between
porter
and
schwarzbier
and
i
see
why
the
blend
of
chocolate
smoke
grainy
acidty
and
german
hop
character
brings
to
mind
just
that
mediumlight
in
body
and
with
a
mediumhigh
level
of
carbonation
this
feels
quite
good
on
the
palate
the
carbonation
does
thin
out
the
mouthfeel
a
little
bit
though
smoke
and
dark
chocolate
linger
on
the
finish
very
nice
overall
tasty
but
after
the
fire
in
the
ham
not
quite
as
good
one
finger
of
resilient
tan
head
on
a
dark
brown
brew
smells
of
caramel
plum
and
a
bit
of
spent
grain
tastes
of
more
caramel
and
black
licorice
and
has
a
slight
smokiness
light
to
medium
and
edgy
going
down
becomes
more
woody
and
smoky
as
it
goes
fine
fine
drinking
on
a
snowy
vermont
eve
o
i
picked
this
up
because
it
is
from
jacks
abby
not
because
it
is
a
rauchbier
which
is
a
new
style
to
me
this
is
the
sort
of
beer
that
makes
me
want
to
further
explore
a
style
recommend
also
goes
great
with
food
well
made
tasty
deft
touch
with
the
smoke
worthy
of
a
try
had
on
tap
at
champions
seems
jacks
abbey
is
everywhere
these
days
this
was
billed
as
a
smokey
dark
beer
which
i
am
always
hit
or
miss
with
this
poured
a
very
dark
color
with
little
head
very
malty
and
caramels
smell
and
the
taste
doesnt
disappoint
nice
crisp
taste
and
the
hints
of
smoke
are
not
overwhelming
which
i
like
i
could
have
a
couple
of
these
like
this
a
lot
this
is
a
medium
bodied
brew
with
a
modest
amount
of
carbonation
it
is
pleasantly
smokey
but
with
plenty
of
other
character
to
take
in
as
well
very
easy
drinking
and
crisp
thanks
again
for
this
one
heath
this
is
a
fantastic
beer
that
is
lighter
than
you
might
expect
and
yet
still
has
all
the
beechwood
smoke
flavor
you
want
it
is
a
roasted
malt
paradise
for
the
eyes
and
for
the
palate
the
full
bodied
taste
is
not
heavy
and
the
mouthfeel
is
silky
and
smooth
there
is
a
touch
of
hop
floral
on
it
that
livens
the
dark
flavors
but
doesnt
compete
with
them
it
has
the
faintest
touch
of
fruit
another
great
beer
from
jacks
abby
overall
i
dont
get
any
of
the
chocolate
malt
indicated
on
the
label
but
still
a
good
dark
lager
overall
best
smoked
lager
i
have
had
so
far
i
typically
dont
like
them
this
beats
out
their
lawsons
collab
for
sure
that
one
had
a
little
cloying
to
it
i
could
drink
several
of
these
brews
i
love
how
easy
this
is
to
drink
i
find
most
smoked
beers
difficult
to
drink
in
excess
cumbersome
to
the
pallet
if
you
will
ill
be
heading
to
the
fridge
for
another
immediately
following
this
review
if
that
tells
you
anything
another
good
offering
from
the
boys
in
framingham
great
beer
unique
style
perfect
for
early
fall
kind
of
like
a
porter
but
different
the
beer
is
murkier
than
most
black
lagers
ive
had
from
these
parts
its
a
dense
boston
fog
of
a
beer
again
perhaps
not
something
entirely
pleasurable
but
it
socks
you
in
and
asks
you
to
study
to
read
and
to
think
the
taste
lingers
like
the
winters
and
tastes
damp
in
your
mouth
for
a
while
like
the
spring
overall
im
a
fan
i
think
this
is
a
great
placebased
beer
note
manufactured
on
april
15
2013
it
definitely
feels
like
a
bigger
beer
than
i
am
used
to
for
schwarzbier
lagers
but
thats
not
a
bad
thing
this
is
their
take
its
also
smoky
which
is
not
quite
appropriate
for
the
style
either
however
its
a
easy
to
drink
beer
interesting
flavor
and
very
satisfying
o
overall
a
decent
smoke
beer
but
fairly
watered
down
o
this
is
a
great
beer
with
a
lot
of
character
and
very
pleasant
qualities
i
really
enjoy
the
smokiness
despite
being
heavy
i
feel
that
this
beer
can
be
enjoyed
any
time
of
the
year
i
highly
recommend
it
like
the
aroma
the
taste
has
a
good
smoked
malty
character
that
is
lightly
sweetened
and
finishes
clean
yes
i
would
have
it
again
o
im
a
sucker
for
these
beers
big
on
flavor
not
as
filling
could
session
this
yum
ointeresting
blend
of
styles
a
little
porter
a
little
dark
lager
did
not
get
a
lot
of
smokiness
in
this
a
really
solid
beer
simple
flavors
but
executed
nicely
really
dug
it
a
dark
murky
brown
colored
brew
with
a
modest
but
stubborn
light
tan
colored
cover
and
decent
lacing
this
brew
served
chilled
in
a
pint
glass
is
looking
pretty
inviting
the
aroma
brings
a
deep
toasted
brown
bread
and
chocolate
malt
medley
with
a
bit
of
a
juniper
bite
over
the
top
very
appealing
the
flavor
comes
on
with
a
fairly
sharp
grassy
hop
tang
which
is
immediately
followed
by
a
charcoal
malt
idea
this
is
definitely
a
bit
brighter
and
more
bitter
than
i
anticipated
with
subtle
smokey
qualities
its
a
tad
thin
in
feel
but
offers
a
brisk
carbonation
in
what
otherwise
is
a
mediumlight
bodied
beer
theres
a
vague
chalkiness
but
nothing
negative
this
generally
strikes
me
as
a
grassy
vegetable
sort
of
brew
with
a
good
smokeymalt
theme
that
makes
for
a
decent
overall
result
a
bit
too
grassy
for
my
tastes
but
not
bad
at
all
overall
an
excellent
brew
sort
of
a
beer
frankenstein
blending
elements
from
a
few
styles
rauchbier
schwarzbier
and
smoked
porter
the
finished
product
is
a
smooth
flavorful
beer
proves
you
dont
need
an
imperial
to
deliver
and
onslaught
of
character
while
i
wouldnt
count
any
of
the
aforementioned
styles
among
my
personal
favorites
smoke
and
dagger
does
work
for
me
and
though
it
wont
earn
a
spot
in
my
regular
rotation
i
will
definitely
be
back
for
more
in
the
future
o
smoke
and
lots
of
lager
yeast
o
its
impressive
that
jacks
abby
only
makes
lagers
and
find
ways
of
making
lagers
taste
absolutely
nothing
like
a
lager
smoke
dagger
is
no
different
and
tastes
like
a
different
style
of
beer
its
a
pretty
solid
and
a
favorite
of
mine
by
them
when
the
weather
puts
me
in
the
mood
for
a
black
lager
will
definitely
purchase
this

i

the

flavors
are
quite
pleasant
and
really
add
to
the
beer
without
being
overwhelming
or
having
too
much
of
an
iodine
flavor
the
beer
was
easy
to
drink
and
i
had
no
problem
putting
down
a
22
oz
bottle
on
my
own
in
fact
i
wish
there
was
a
little
more
of
it
to
drink
would
pair
very
nicely
with
meats
overall
i
liked
this
more
than
i
expected
and
would
definitely
have
it
again
a
nice
dark

that
would
be
perfect

more

and
perhaps
the
best
ive
ever
had
overall
a
curious
melding
of
several
styles
schwarzbier
porter
and
rauchbier
i
think
they
all
worked
together
very
well
but
this
is
kind
of
onetime
beer
that
i
wouldnt
probably
seek
out
again
i
split
a
bottle
of
this
with
goblinmunkey7
roughly
a
year
ago
and
this
bottle
is
even
better
than
i
remember
there
are
some
nice
smoke
and
chocolate
notes
here
in
an
impressive
amount
of
balance
another
winner
from
jacks
abby
with
a
touch
of
confusion
i
can
see
why
the
beer
doesnt
settle
on
a
set
style
when
a
blend
of
welltested
recipes
will
obviously
work
better
jacks
abby
proves
that
theres
a
ton
of
imagination
that
if
not
bound
by
the
rules
of
beer
making
light
body
with
some
decent
soft
carbonation
easier
to
drink
rauchbier

being

a

it

cheers
i
love
everything
about
this
beer
i
love
that
jacks
abby
makes
such
wonderfully
unique
lagers
and
that
its
a
neighborhood
brewery
for
those
of
us
in
the
boston
area
the
12
liter
bottle
and
label
are
beautiful
and
the
color
and
aroma
are
great
whats
exceptional
for
me
was
the
mouthfeel

wine
arlington
ma
i
just
found
out
that
theres
a
peanut
butter
of
this
beer
which
i
now
must
have
overall
i
really
enjoyed
this
beer
i
was
super
easy
to
drink
and
quite
interesting
i
would
definitely
have
more
in
the
future
o
this
is
a
great
smoked
beer
it
smells
nice
and
tastes
great
with
much
more
complexity
than
expected
from
the
nose
this
is
really
tasty
and
very
drinkable
especially
for
a
smoky
beer
like
this
poured
a
deep
brown
with
two
fingers
of
rich
creamy
tan
head
that
thinned
quickly
but
plenty
of
foam
clung
to
the
glass
aroma
was
a
whiff
of
smoke
maybe
a
little
malt
underneath
not
much
there
really
but
the
flavor
really
popped
in
a
nice
little
surprise
package
definite
smokiness
definite
roasted
malts
some
chocolate
tones
in
the
dark
sweet
area
nothing
dominates
and
very
well
balanced
a
little
bitter
on
the
finish
but
carbonated
well
enough
to
brighten
things
up
and
make
it
lively
crisp
and
clean
a
very
balanced
enjoyable
brew
this
is
one
of
the
best
americanmade
lagers
ive
had
i
love
the
dryness
combined
with
the
malt
complexities
all
in
a
highly
drinkable
package
the
other
jacks
abby
brews
ive
had
have
been
somewhat
underwhelming
but
smoke
dagger
is
excellent

thanks
man
appearance
is
a
deep
auburn
with
crimson
highlight
layer
of
tan
head
with
plenty
of
sticky
lacing
the
nose
is
like
a
campfire
heavily
smoked
with
layers
of
hickory
ash
and
roasted
malts
the
taste
meets
the
palate
with
some
caramel
malt
character
which
brings
a
little
sweetness
before
the
smoke
cuts
through
roasted
malts
and
smoke
take
turns
as
it
finishes
with
heavy
woody
smoke
character
this
is
a
very
flavorful
and
smokey
rauchbier
lots
of
depth
in
the
flavor
the
mouthfeel
is
somewhat
thin
with
moderate
to
high
carbonation
overall
a
winner
especially
if
smoked
beers
are
your
thing
o
havent
had
many
black
lagers
or
rauchbiers
but
i
like
this
one
theres
a
smoky
aspect
but
its
not
overpowering
a
solid
session
brew
that
i
think
would
be
easy
to
like
this
beer
is
named
after
jacks
abbys
two
brewery
cats
smoke
and
dagger
it
pours
a
very
dark
brown
color
bordering
on
black
but
sits
in
the
glass
as
just
plain
clean
black
with
a
light
white
fluffy
head
that
has
the
barest
hints
of
tan
in
it
on
the
nose
the
beer
smells
nicely
smoked
with
rich
beechwood
notes
and
slight
chocolate
and
black
coffee
the
beer
smells
very
much
of
woodsy
smoke
but
the
smell
still
carries
the
clean
lager
aromatics
that
are
expect
from
the
style
i
was
hoping
for
a
little
more
pungency
but
now
that
the
beer
is
before
me
i
think
too
much
smell
would
offput
its
lager
qualities
and
ruin
the
beer
on
the
taste
the
beer
is
richly
layered
with
woodsy
smoke
in
the
initial
gulp
there
is
big
beachwood
notes
that
are
slowly
enveloped
with
rich
smoke
and
then
roasted
chocolate
malts
and
then
rich
dark
coffee
all
the
while
shinning
with
the
rich
complexities
of
the
beechwood
in
the
middle
of
the
taste
the
chocolate
malts
do
provide
a
slight
burp
of
sweet
that
borders
on
strange
but
is
quickly
enveloped
by
the
other
complexities
of
the
beer
and
dutifully
managed
citrus
is
also
present
in
the
taste
as
a
faint
ghost
that
haunts
the
latter
half
of
the
swallow
the
aftertaste
of
this
beer
is
light
with
beechwood
smoke
and
hints
of
coffee
but
nothing
more
this
beer
is
meaty
with
flavor
and
deliciously
easy
to
sip
on
the
mouth
the
beer
feels
thin
crisp
and
refreshing
as
all
lagers
should
carbonation
is
effervescent
but
not
prickly
working
to
nicely
cleanse
the
palate
and
ready
it
for
another
sip
after
each
sip
the
mouth
is
left
only
slightly
dry
with
woodsy
smoke
and
with
the
faintest
hints
of
sticky
saliva
griming
the
tongue
and
roof
of
the
mouth
with
the
sweet
smoke
taste
overall
this
beer
is
another
success
from
jacks
abby
i
think
i
like
it
more
than
the
version
brewed
with
coffee
as
this
beer
stands
perfectly
on
its
own
and
i
feel
that
the
coffee
cuts
through
some
of
the
complex
flavors
of
this
beer
this
beer
is
very
drinkable
and
completely
worthy
of
a
try
with
great
locally
sourced
ingredients
and
an
even
better
taste
it
even
pairs
well
with
gorgonzola
cheese
try
this
beer
o
solid
brew
finds
the
right
balance
of
smoke
roast
and
sweetness
drinks
more
like
a
smokey
porter
to
me
but
nonetheless
another
solid
offering
from
ja
overall
this
is
very
nice
fare
boasting
a
wellrounded
nicely
balanced
and
flavorful
body
that
is
everything
a
schwarzbier
should
be
with
a
tantalizing
touch
of
smoky
peat
added
that
pushes
the
flavors
to
wonderful
heights
its
not
necessarily
a
beer
that
brings
anything
new
to
the
style
but
instead
prefers
to
set
itself
aside
by
being
simply
a
finelycrafted
example
and
a
model
of
understated
perfection
in
craft
taste
begins
with
a
shot
of
smoke
goes
quite
sweet
in
the
middle
coupled
with
a
shot
of
citrus
and
then
closes
with
a
light
bitterness
mouthfeel
is
smooth
and
drinkability
is
great
seemed
maybe
too
sweet
but
it
came
together
nicely
for
me
in
the
end
pour
is
dark
black
with
a
tan
head
and
some
larger
bubbles
nose
is
light
malt
and
chocolate
notes
with
a
light
grain
and
herbal
hop
taste
is
a
good
full
flavored
dark
chocolate
and
light
roast
to
it
stout
like
favors
with
a
lighter
body
and
grainy
hoppy
finish
dry
clean
finish
and
well
carbonated
overall
way
above
my
expectations
for
another
smoked
beer
i
usually
hate
smoked
beer
but
this
was
enjoyable
with
its
many
stoutlike
qualities
o
another
solid
beer
from
ja
though
it
would
be
smokier
but
it
wasnt
over
the
top
and
blended
nicely
with
the
rest
of
the
flavors
a
balanced
beer
with
very
light
smoke
and
a
bit
thin
for
my
tastes
i
would
just
like
more
of
all
aspects
of
this
beer
poured
on
nitrotap
and
served
in
a
tumbler
pint
the
beer
is
a
dark
rich
rubyhazelnut
coloring
that
comes
with
a
decent
cascade
after
the
fireworks
settle
you
end
up
with
a
thick
dense
creamy
tan
head
looks
great
and
always
fun
to
watch
aromas
of
coffee
and
chocolate
both
roasted
bitter
and
creamy
with
a
toffee
highlight
this
smells
like
a
sweettooth
satisfier
flavors
are
roasted
and
slightly
smokey
initially
with
a
nutty
and
coffee
backbone
the
smoke
continues
throughout
as
there
is
an
unveiling
of
charcoal
and
campfire
qualities
that
take
over
the
palate
toffee
sweet
intertwines
through
the
palate
as
a
highlight
and
backbone
at
the
same
time
the
body
is
light
and
crisp
almost
to
the
point
of
being
watered
down
great
coating
cling
along
the
glass
as
you
drink
the
aftertaste
is
smokey
with
a
dose
of
the
rich
sweet
background
flavors
smooth
creamy
and
clean
finish
this
is
a
tasty
brew
very
drinkable
and
very
tasty
o
overall
a
pretty
good
beer
kind
of
reminds
me
of
guinness
light
with
a
hint
of
smoke
tons
of
roasted
malts
and
chocolate
along
with
light
smoke
and
easy
to
drink
would
like
to
have
again
and
would
jump
to
have
it
again
on
nitrotap
pours
a
very
dark
brown
with
a
fluffy
offwhite
head
smell
is
a
nice
mix
of
roasted
malt
chocolate
and
smoke
that
all
blend
together
quite
nicely
and
none
of
the
aromas
are
too
overpowering
the
smoke
is
more
prominent
in
the
flavor
than
in
the
nose
but
still
doesnt
overpower
as
the
roastiness
and
chocolate
hold
up
against
the
smoke
nicely
interestingly
the
more
i
drink
the
less
smoke
i
taste
and
the
more
the
roasted
malts
come
through
not
sure
if
thats
a
product
of
the
warming
or
just
getting
accustomed
to
the
smoke
flavor
mouthfeel
is
lightmedium
bodied
with
nice
carbonation
overall
this
comes
off
as
a
nice
smokey
schwarzbier
im
impressed
that
the
schwarzbier
characteristics
shine
through
as
well
as
they
do
and
balance
out
the
smoke
nicely
i
like
this
one
more
than
the
cascadian
schwarzbier
as
i
feel
like
the
smoke
suits
the
beer
better
than
the
hops
do
overall
this
is
a
nice
beer
that
i
would
happily
drink
again
the
label
describes
this
as
somewhere
between
a
schwarzbier
and
a
smoked
porter
which
is
a
lengthier
but
more
accurate
description
than
a
rauchbier
the
smoke
is
quite
tame
here
that
being
said
pretty
great
beer
and
very
easy
drinking
lots
of
porterlike
flavors
while
maintaining
that
lager
feel
another
winner
from
jacks
abby
smoke
dagger
pours
jet
black
with
a
surprising
three
and
a
half
fingers
of
khaki
colored
foam
head
retention
is
very
good
and
lacing
while
night
quite
sheetlike
is
very
good
the
nose
has
a
nice
balance
between
roasty
grains
and
smoke
though
id
say
the
roast
leans
more
towards
coffee
than
chocolate
the
flavor
profile
is
more
of
the
same
the
front
end
is
a
nice
smooth
black
coffee
with
some
subtle
chocolate
undertones
smoky
bbq
type
flavors
then
begin
to
creep
in
and
build
in
intensity
eventually
taking
over
the
beer
completely
by
the
finish
the
body
is
sturdy
while
maintaining
a
dry
enough
finish
to
avoid
becoming
overly
full
or
rich
the
carbonation
has
a
little
bit
of
pep
to
it
but
stays
on
the
lower
end
of
the
spectrum
smoke
and
daggers
was
my
first
jacks
abby
brew
and
i
definitely
dug
the
smoky
schwarzbier
vibe
the
pour
is
a
dark
amber
color
with
an
offwhite
head
strong
smoke
aroma
to
this
but
still
plenty
of
malt
sweetness
good
caramel
toffee
and
toasted
bread
aromas
a
light
woodiness
to
it
the
flavor
is
sweet
and
malty
with
a
nice
smokiness
light
wood
and
salt
notes
plenty
of
toast
and
caramel
malts
a
light
chocolate
flavor
to
it
as
well
overall
nice
and
chocolaty
rauch
ranks
right
up
there
with
the
best
i
have
had
being
produced
in
the
states
the
chocolate
element
distinguishes
this
beer
from
others
in
the
category
probably
my
second
favorite
from
the
brewery
only
behind
leisure
time
lager
pours
a
solid
dark
brown
with
a
huge
creamy
off
white
head
that
persists
forever
smells
of
bread
and
chocolate
mostly
with
a
hint
of
smoke
and
coffee
the
flavor
has
little
bit
more
roast
and
coffee
than
i
expected
huge
notes
of
chocolate
and
caramel
in
each
sip
with
a
light
smoky
essence
in
the
background
medium
body
with
a
moderate
level
of
carbonation
and
a
sweet
slick
mouthfeel
very
flavorful
smooth
easy
drinking
dark
lager
its
nice
that
they
didnt
go
overboard
with
the
smoked
malt
like
everyone
seems
to
be
doing
these
days
not
smooth
or
refreshing
i
figured
itd
be
great
for
a
hot
summer
day
but
it
didnt
quite
hit
the
spot
good
but
not
memorable
o
not
as
complex
as
i
was
expecting
but
still
good
and
highly
drinkable
really
love
the
mouthfeel
definitely
something
to
experience
i
cant
think
of
any
other
american
breweries
doing
a
beer
like
this
easily
worth
a
buy
especially
at
the
very
fair
price
of
2
99
a
bottle
the
four
pack
is
even
more
economical
500ml
bottle
served
in
a
reissdorf
stange

the
color
and
clarity
of
cola
with
a
loose
2
5
inch
khakicolored
head
that
sizzles
and
pops
as
it
slowly
fizzes
down
to
an
18th
inch
cap
thick
textured
swaths
of
lacing
are
revealed
during
the
tasting
nose
expresses
hints
of
chocolate
and
roast
with
the
merest
suggestion
of
smoke
towards
the
back
end
taste
follows
nose
however
it
all
comes
off
a
bit
watery
and
closer
to
a
schwartzbier
than
a
rauchbier
in
my
opinion
mouthfeel
is
light
in
body
and
starts
off
with
an
almost
silky
feel
at
the
tip
of
the
tongue
but
quickly
yields
to
a
more
watery
consistency
carbonation
is
assertive
without
being
prickly
or
gassy
overall
this
beer
is
lacking
in
the
smokiness
ive
come
to
associate
with
the
style
and
im
actually
okay
with
that
i
didnt
realize
this
was
a
rauchbier
when
i
purchased
it
that
said
a
decent
brew
but
definitely
closer
to
a
schwartzbier
than
a
rauchbier
and
there
are
better
examples
of
schwartzbiers
out
there
if
that
is
what
you
are
looking
for
another
excellent
offering
from
jacks
abbey
a
fine
introduction
to
the
more
potent
rauchbiers
out
there
o
this
was
a
good
smoked
beer
from
jacks
abby
i
didnt
like
it
nearly
as
much
as
hoponius
union
it
is
one
of
the
better
rauchbiers
ive
had
but
definitely
not
the
best
the
beer
is
very
easy
to
drink
has
a
nice
aroma
a
wellbalanced
taste
and
a
pleasant
feel
the
only
thing
it
could
have
used
a
tiny
bit
more
of
is
a
little
bit
more
flavor
other
then
that
this
beer
was
definitely
a
good
quality
rauchbier
at
11
50
for
a
4pack
of
500ml
bottles
or
3
25
for
a
single
you
cant
go
wrong
i
definitely
recommend
giving
it
a
try
o
all
that
adds
up
to
one
really
good
beer
jacks
abby
does
it
again
smoke
and
dagger
is
fantastic
and
at
2
50
a
pint
at
the
local
packie
ill
have
another
notes
this
big
boy
is
all
malt
and
very
drinkable
and
very
tasty

this

has
certainly
opened
my
eyes
to
jacks
abby
not
nearly
as
smoky
as
most
rauchbiers
i
have
experienced

still

i
will
definitely
pick

up
again
in

notes
body
is
slightly
fuller
then
average
with
medium

which
suits
the

well
brewed
and
somewhat
unique
i
would
love
to
have
a
more
regular
access
to
this
beer
drink
overall
it
was
pretty
good
wasnt
the
best
nor
the
worst
great
layered
flavors
but
doesnt
punch
you
in
the
face
toasty
dark
roasted

but
not
overdone
the
slight
sweet
note
is
pushed
aside
as
this
brew
finishes
crisp
coffee
a
little
smokiness
mild
bitterness
smooth

highly
drinkable
and
medium

but
maybe
on
the
light
side
of
that
enjoyable

worthy
o

i
have
had
this
one
was
also
a
damn
steal
at
2
30ish
for
a
half
liter
this
beer
has
actually
turned
me
on
to
a
style
i
dont
like
very
much
after
only
having
2
of
jacks
abbys
beers
i
can
already
say
they
are
one
of
the
best
breweries
in
the
state
and
even
all
of
new
england
smokiness
is
quite
mild
and
palatable
if
youve
never
tried
a
rauchbier
not
a
bad
first
one
to
try
mouthfeel
is
solid
medium
light
body
cant
say
light
cause
its
a
dark
beer
with
a
light
and
smooth
lager
carbonation
the
more
you
drink
the
more
the
smoke
comes
through
this
would
be
excellent
with
anything
grilled
poured
a
1
5
cappucino
head
with
long
life
the
body
pours
dark
but
clear
but
in
masstone
its
a
deep
umber
brown
verging
on
coffee
the
smell
is
very
mild
and
mainly
roasted
malt
taste
is
much
weaker
than
i
was
expecting
but
has
the
crispness
of
a
lager
a
touch
of
smoke
and
a
little
roasted
malt
and
easy
drinking
enjoyable
and
not
boring
lager
mouthfeel
is
light
and
velvety
smooth
overall
a
very
tasty
beverage
sure
to
please
any
smoked
beer
fan
o
pretty
simple
rauchbier
im
honestly
not
a
fan
of
smoked
beers
at
all
but
this
one
isnt
overpowering
the
smoke
doesnt
just
taste
like
liquid
smoke
either
tastes
like
hickory
bbq
the
chocolate
and
coffee
compliments
it
well
too
cheers
very
drinkable
this
is
not
a
smokey
beer
at
all
while
the
smoke
exists
it
really
is
merely
to
complement
the
other
flavors
not
overpower
them
if
you
want
a
smokey
rauchbier
youll
be
disappointed
i
however
really
appreciated
the
subtly
balance
and
immense
drinkability
o
very
good
for
a
rauch
bier
but
i
think
i
would
group
this
more
in
the
smoked
porter
category
but
a
great
use
of
smoke
just
the
same
not
overwhelimg
but
in
their
just
right
for
balance
o
tasty
goes
down
easily
not
too
filling
decent
kick
good
representation
of
style
this
beer
was
an
excellent
complement
to
pastrami
sandwich
and
overall
is
a
very
good
smoked
beer
o
this
was
a
really
nice
rauchbier
that
was
supereasy
to
drink
for
a
style
i
find
hard
to
have
much
of
i
would
say
this
is
more
of
a
lager
with
some
smoke
qualities
added
in
there
good
stuff
would
drink
again
d
a
very
good
and
authentic
rauchbier
this
isnt
the
most
sexy
style
of
beer
and
i
was
a
bit
apprehensive
about
having
2l
of
rauchbier
i
neednt
have
worried
about
it
as
i
returned
to
this
for
numerous
refills
during
the
course
of
the
super
bowl
i
highly
recommend
this
beer
for
rauchbier
lovers
its
delicious
another
fabulous
beer
from
jacks
abby
almost
runs
the
fine
line
between
black
lager
and
mildy
smoked
porter
the
meaty
smoke
flavor
in
this
beer
is
absolutely
stunning
good
stuff
djust
an
awesome
beer
so
clean
and
yet
so
flavorful
i
would
not
only
drink
this
again
but
i
would
seek
it
out
the
boys
at
jacks
abby
have
another
winner
with
smoke
dagger
while
the
mild
smokiness
had
me
comparing
this
beer
more
to
a
schwarzbier
than
a
rauchbier
this
is
a
damn
fine
brew
nonetheless
overall
nice
smoke
is
done
well
without
the
heavy
smoke
flavor
not
too
bitter
or
tannic
either
and
nice
soft
malt
and
lager
flavors
nice
oats
and
even
a
hint
of
chocolate
coming
late
much
different
than
anything
ive
had
before
i
think
and
done
fairly
well
they
easily
could
have
gone
overboard
on
anything
but
didnt
perhaps
a
touch
more
of
the
lager
flavors
and
crispness
would
have
been
nicer
o
went
very
well
with
the
bbq
i
had
at
redbones
definitely
would
drink
this
brew
again
i
was
graciously
given
a
growler
from
a
friend
who
made
a
visit
to
the
brewery
last
weekend
he
knew
my
affinity
for
dark
beers
poured
into
a
tall
beer
glass
super
dark
black
body
great
looking
white
head
forms
with
a
vigorous
pour
but
that
soon
fades
the
body
looks
a
bit
undercarbonated
once
the
beer
has
sat
for
a
bit
the
smell
is
a
wonderful
aroma
of
campfire
smoke
the
taste
is
great
too
love
the
earthy
peaty
aroma
but
i
get
less
smoke
flavor
as
i
drink
and
more
of
a
burntend
brisket
taste
while
bbq
is
not
a
bad
thing
its
more
charcoal
flavor
than
smoke
mouthfeel
was
a
bit
thin
but
thats
what
i
expected
from
a
smoked
lager
overall
its
a
decent
beer
and
i
liked
it
better
than
the
red
lager
or
the
ipl
this
one
just
seemed
more
unique
a
nice
intro
the
brewery
and
i
wish
them
well
o
overall
this
was
a
pretty
nice
lightly
smoked
beer
good
appearance
and
malt
characteristics
make
this
a
definate
have
again
brew
this
was
a
great
beer
i
usually
dont
go
for
lagers
but
these
guys
are
definately
doing
things
right
o
i
enjoy
sd
more
the
coffee
compliments
the
smokiness
but
there
was
some
underlying
sweetness
that
turned
me
off
the
coffee
and
hint
of
smoke
really
make
this
beer
delicious
this
is
perfect
on
a
cold
evening
by
the
fire
excellent
coffee
nose
not
subtle
coffee
taste
but
very
good
smoky
malts
seem
to
awake
more
as
i
drink
the
beer
but
the
coffee
is
most
of
the
show
here
as
it
seems
just
as
strong
as
the
malt
base
i
have
always
been
a
fan
of
the
base
beer
and
i
am
now
just
as
big
of
a
fan
of
this
iteration
fresh
coffee
and
rauchbier
means
good
smells
decent
light
hint
of
smoke
little
bit
of
coffee
pretty
much
same
with
the
flavor
with
occasional
hints
of
light
chocolate
i
just
now
got
a
little
toasted
coconut
on
the
end
slight
bitterness
lingers
for
a
bit
ive
had
smoke
and
dagger
a
handful
of
times
but
probably
variations
of
it
more
than
the
original
id
really
like
to
compare
it
to
this
side
by
side
solid
beer
overall
anyway
it
wont
change
your
life
but
it
is
a
good
take
on
getting
a
coffee
beer
and
making
it
seemingly
cleaner
and
more
light
bodied
in
character
i
do
wish
there
were
more
smokiness
and
representation
of
the
yeasty
profile
at
hand
it
gets
a
little
drowned
out
overall
cant
say
its
my
favorite
from
these
guys
but
cant
say
theres
anything
particularly
wrong
with
it
500ml
bottle
served
in
a
stange
pours
the
color
and
clarity
of
cola
with
a
fizzy
one
inch
tancolored
head
head
eventually
settles
into
a
18th
inch
cap
with
some
residual
strands
of
lacing
left
in
the
wake
of
the
receding
brew
nose
suggests
chocolate
malt
roast
and
a
hint
of
coffee
taste
is
roasty
with
a
metallic
quality
in
the
forefront
chocolate
character
is
almost
nonexistent
and
the
overall
flavor
profile
comes
off
a
bit
watered
down
finish
is
slightly
bitter
and
lingers
between
quaffs
mouthfeel
is
light
and
a
bit
watery
with
a
prickly
carbonation
overall
i
have
to
say
that
im
a
bit
disappointed
by
this
one
definitely
not
getting
a
rauchbier
vibe
either
not
sure
if
it
is
classified
correctly
pours
dark
brown
with
a
medium
foamy
tanmocha
head
aroma
has
dark
chocolate
roasty
malts
and
a
slight
woody
note
flavor
still
has
plenty
of
dark
chocolate
but
adds
nice
roastiness
mild
coffee
notes
that
help
cut
the
sweetness
and
must
the
faintest
hint
of
woody
smoke
mouthfeel
is
full
and
the
finish
lingers
to
a
blend
of
coffee
and
faint
dark
chocolate
regular
smoke
and
dagger
is
great
the
cask
version
of
this
one
is
just
ok
not
all
that
exciting
o
decent
but
i
wouldnt
actually
get
this
again
theres
much
better
coffee
beers
out
there
this
one
isnt
smooth
and
refined
as
youd
want
it
but
hey
im
sure
theres
people
who
would
prefer
this
over
some
others
this
is
a
very
good
rauchbier
that
benefits
from
the
addition
of
coffee
but
the
enhancement
is
not
particularly
profound
smoke
dagger
is
already
a
great
beer
this
is
simply
a
nice
spin
on
it
worth
a
try
this
is
the
first
time
a
ja
beer
has
left
me
disappointed
o
solid
beer
but
unimpressive
in
my
opinion
nothing
special
and
a
tad
disappointing
tastes
and
smells
like
they
just
took
the
base
beer
and
dumped
in
some
coffee
concentrate
jacks
abby
doesnt
make
a
bad
beer
and
rarely
makes
a
mediocre
beer
but
this
is
a
case
of
a
mediocre
offering
from
them
this
bottle
was
graciously
laid
on
me
by
jamie
m
during
a
lancaster
visit
he
knows
im
a
fan
of
all
things
lager
if
i
had
an
issue
with
this
really
fine
beer
it
would
be
that
it
verges
on
being
out
of
balance
although
the
combination
of
pronounced
flavors
dont
obscure
its
lager
basis
although
cold
this
evening
the
weather
isnt
quite
bad
enough
to
warrant
drinking
this
hefty
and
delicious
black
lager
flakes
may
be
necessary
this
is
a
medium
bodied
brew
with
a
modest
amount
of
carbonation
it
is
crisp
easy
reinking
and
enjoyable
a
nice
subtle
difference
from
the
base
brew
if
i
was
going
to
complain
about
anything
with
this
it
would
be
that
after
having
the
regular
smoke
and
dagger
just
before
drinking
this
the
coffee
inclusion
was
almost
undetectable
thanks
again
heath
for
this
one
o
smoked
beers
are
easily
my
most
hated
style
this
one
has
a
decent
sweetness
to
it
to
help
balance
out
the
acrid
smoke
like
the
base
beer
the
addition
of
coffee
helps
even
more
and
adds
some
nice
complexity
at
the
same
time
i
feel
that
the
coffee
could
be
a
little
stronger
and
it
would
really
set
this
brew
apart
but
jacks
abby
isnt
huge
on
making
adjuncts
over
the
top
so
i
understand
o
really
good
cheers
o
overall
i
am
relatively
shocked
here
i
am
used
to
home
runs
from
jacks
abby
and
this
one
with
the
watery
mouthfeel
and
shockingly
mediocre
appearance
at
a
loss
for
words
i
guess
every
brewery
has
its
flukes
but
yeah
let
down
by
this
one
from
the
new
batch
poured
from
the
bottle
into
a
tree
house
snifter
bought
the
coffee
that
they
used
from
red
barn
also
but
thats
for
coffeeadvocate
com
pours
nice
and
dark
smell
of
roasted
coffee
and
faint
smoke
about
a
finger
head
and
that
was
from
a
pretty
vigorous
pour
no
retention
to
speak
of
no
lacing
either
taste
is
awesome
roasted
coffee
up
front
mild
smoke
not
nearly
as
much
as
i
would
like
but
this
isnt
targeted
to
a
rauchhead
like
me
very
easy
drinker
and
a
definite
upgrade
from
the
regular
version
i
dont
know
how
often
they
are
planning
on
bottling
this
but
definitely
pick
one
up
o
very
good
stuff
i
recalled
the
regular
smoke
and
dagger
not
having
as
much
smoke
and
theres
not
a
lot
of
coffee
notes
but
its
still
quite
nice
had
this
one
at
a
recent
tasting
while
mississipping
was
in
town
served
from
bottle
into
a
mikkeller
taster
flute
poured
a
massively
dark
redbrown
with
a
half
finger
offwhite
head
that
subsided
to
a
minimal
amount
slowly
maintained
excellent
lacing
throughout
the
glass
the
aroma
was
comprised
of
sweet
malt
powdered
chocolate
roasted
malt
cream
and
coffee
the
flavor
was
of
sweet
malt
cream
coffee
milk
chocolate
and
earth
it
had
a
light
feel
on
the
palate
with
mediumhigh
carbonation
overall
this
was
a
pretty
decent
brew
based
on
the
other
brews
from
jacks
abby
that
ive
had
they
have
the
aroma
aspect
of
beers
absolutely
nailed
nice
notes
of
sweetness
and
roastiness
from
the
coffee
going
on
kept
this
one
really
well
balanced
and
enjoyable
to
the
nose
the
flavor
had
some
of
the
same
notes
but
it
just
wasnt
as
robust
and
well
balanced
as
the
aroma
going
on
still
definitely
worth
your
time
trying
if
you
get
the
chance
o
more
smoke
than
coffee
in
this
one
nothing
dominates
too
much
though
and
execution
is
quite
good
a
well
crafted
brew
for
sure
that
was
certainly
very
interestingunique
definitely
worth
trying
though
i
certainly
prefer
jacks
hoppy
lagers
overall
i
really
enjoy
this
beer
for
the
style
its
one
of
the
better
coffee
beers
ive
had
and
isnt
an
overpowering
stout
better
than
regular
smoke
and
dagger
too
overall
pretty
good
nice
coffee
addition
the
nutty
malts
are
nice
as
well
coffee
is
fairly
fresh
with
no
burnt
flavors
and
the
smoke
is
just
in
the
right
balance
a
good
beer
but
nothing
to
write
home
about
pretty
drinkable
i
should
have
bought
more
than
one
good
but
not
great
stuff
nice
change
of
pace
from
the
regular
s
d
what
an
interesting
beer
i
like
the
idea
coffee
with
the
sd
makes
perfect
sense
but
i
almost
wish
it
was
bigger
the
coffee
doesnt
overpower
but
the
lager
really
doesnt
give
it
enough
backbone
you
almost
need
a
double
or
imperial
sd
to
give
it
some
more
girth
otherwise
the
clean
lagered
body
with
the
coffee
just
makes
it
taste
like
watered
down
coffee
great
coffee
but
watered
down
its
still
a
really
great
beer
though
despite
what
might
read
like
my
negative
review
kudos
to
ja
for
pushing
the
envelope
who
makes
a
coffee
rauchbier
too
smokey
for
me
ive
had
other
rauchbiers
and
this
was
just
over
the
top
smokey
it
overpowered
the
beer
and
made
it
seem
like
i
was
drinking
a
bottle
of
liquid
smoke
strange
all
around
really
liked
smoke
and
dagger
but
this
is
another
level
of
smoke
with
it
being
in
the
forefront
i
did
not
care
for
it
ok
wow
tastes
like
smoked
ham
wrapped
in
smoked
bacon
thats
really
all
there
is
to
say
about
this
beer
very
unique
never
had
anything
like
it
smoke
flavor
is
not
overpowering
like
other
smokey
beers
ive
had
not
something
i
could
drink
that
often
but
something
i
would
definitely
encourage
everyone
to
try
at
least
once
o
way
more
balanced
than
i
expected
after
reading
reviews
the
smoke
is
intense
and
unique
but
not
as
intense
as
advertised
in
my
opinion
overall
this
is
usually
one
of
my
least
favorite
styles
as
it
can
easily
become
overly
meaty
but
this
one
balances
out
quite
nicely
the
smokiness
is
delicate
as
it
should
be
and
the
malts
provide
just
enough
sweetness
to
balance
everything
out
overall
a
nice
beer
but
5
of
a
liter
was
way
too
much
for
me
id
have
to
cap
it
at
46
oz
personally
if
you
love
super
smokey
beers
check
it
out
but
a
bit
too
much
for
me
to
want
a
full
glass
of
again
a
grilled
mccadam
cheddar
horseradish
dill
havarti
on
multi
grain
bread
with
tomato
cheddar
bisque
definitely
helped
bring
out
the
earthiness
of
this
beer
they
are
not
kidding
about
the
ham
taste
my
god
deeply
unpleasant
to
my
palate
but
kudos
to
ja
for
trying
new
things
you
have
to
like
this
style
if
you
dont
this
beer
wont
be
for
you
it
is
extremely
smoky
almost
meat
like
excellent
accompaniment
to
food
its
a
little
bit
too
meaty
for
its
lighter
body
beef
up
the
malts
a
bit
and
this
would
be
better
nice
smoke
balance
and
not
fake
tasting
but
the
ham
flavor
doesnt
work
for
me
this
specialty
brew
is
a
cloudy
golden
hue
with
a
respectable
white
cover
and
very
little
to
show
for
lacing
the
aroma
offers
a
clear
perfume
of
hickory
smoke
with
a
subtle
ham
and
wheat
idea
to
inspire
the
palate
and
the
flavor
follows
but
my
first
impression
is
that
its
a
bit
watered
down
from
what
the
aroma
suggested
in
fact
this
brew
seems
to
be
aiming
for
a
lighter
sessionable
appeal
with
a
decidedly
frisky
feel
from
pin
point
carbonation
and
a
generally
mediumlight
body
this
is
solid
stuff
that
will
translate
very
well
into
the
summer
months
or
to
accompany
an
appropriate
meal
but
the
flavor
hits
up
front
and
then
seems
to
quickly
dissipate
into
the
heavy
carbonation
likeable
enough
one
id
definitely
drink
again
but
not
a
show
stopper
creation
as
some
of
these
abby
beers
are
however
i
dont
think
they
were
aiming
for
that
anyway
this
beer
was
as
i
have
finished
a
real
treat
for
me
thanks
again
kevin
this
is
a
medium
bodied
bree
with
a
modest
amount
of
carbonation
overall
an
interesting
mix
and
enjoyable
this
is
easy
to
approach
and
really
easy
drinking
i
would
not
mind
having
this
again
thanks
heath
overall
fits
the
name
a
pilsner
with
a
great
meaty
smoke
flavor
o
very
nice
take
on
a
rauchbier
much
lighter
than
expected
and
quite
the
easy
drink
good
show
jacks
overall
im
surprised
by
this
one
not
really
into
smoked
beers
that
much
but
this
is
solid
o
a
nicely
executed
americanbrewed
rauchbier
that
provides
plenty
of
smoke
in
the
nose
while
not
being
completely
onedimensional
in
the
taste
easy
to
quaff
and
drink
lots
of
track
some
down
if
youre
a
fan
of
smoked
beers
o
really
well
balance
and
easy
to
drink
smoke
dominates
and
is
deliciously
flavored
thanks
again
kevin
overall
this
is
a
very
very
good
beer
with
a
nicely
balanced
flavor
winner
poured
from
bottle
into
a
tree
house
snifter
i
am
a
rauchhead
so
this
may
be
a
biased
review
smell
is
amazing
campfire
mixed
with
a
little
ham
and
bacon
i
could
sniff
this
all
day
pours
light
amber
color
about
a
1
inch
head
with
very
little
retention
taste
is
also
awesome
the
smoke
is
actually
lighter
than
it
is
on
the
nose
but
there
is
definitely
a
porkbacon
taste
here
this
is
insanely
drinkable
for
a
rauchbier
if
you
like
smoked
beer
at
all
try
this
its
a
step
below
the
best
schlenkerla
beers
but
its
still
great
and
like
all
ja
beers
great
value
pale
orange
very
light
amber
in
color
with
a
decent
head
but
not
too
big
the
first
thing
i
get
when
i
smell
is
the
smoke
nice
sweet
smoke
almost
like
mesquite
wood
taste
is
surprisingly
light
and
fruity
at
first
sip
and
the
smoke
follows
afterward
not
overpowering
at
all
it
starts
crisp
and
clean
slides
into
a
smooth
smokiness
and
then
finishes
amazingly
crisp
and
clean
again
its
almost
like
a
campfire
but
the
smokiness
is
sweeter
and
less
astringent
this
beer
goes
down
easy
and
it
refreshing
at
the
same
time
which
can
be
hard
to
say
about
some
smoked
beers
all
in
all
this
is
a
pretty
stellar
concoction
i
definitely
dig
the
unabashed
bacon
flavors
the
sweet
malts
blend
nicely
as
well
making
this
feel
especially
breakfasty
i
would
prefer
some
more
complexities
and
lager
qualities
however
oa
decent
smoked
beer
with
intense
flavor
and
a
backbone
to
support
it
the
beer
pours
a
surprisingly
golden
yellow
color
with
a
lager
clean
body
that
has
a
nice
murky
haze
and
tons
of
little
carbonation
bubbles
racing
to
the
surface
the
head
is
huge
and
white
full
of
a
gradually
growing
size
of
bubbles
which
top
out
around
medium
sized
the
beers
lacing
is
fat
and
foamy
on
the
sides
of
the
glass
leaving
long
strings
and
fangs
on
the
glass
on
the
nose
the
beer
smells
terrifically
meaty
with
smoke
and
a
nice
underlying
caramel
malt
this
is
not
the
most
overpowering
rauchbier
but
it
has
a
nice
big
nose
that
brings
bacon
and
a
tender
malty
beer
into
ones
mind
on
the
tongue
the
beer
tastes
dry
and
salty
and
is
terrifically
complex
with
bacony
smoked
malts
light
hay
hops
and
a
touch
of
salt
the
beer
begins
with
light
hayish
hops
and
a
touch
of
caramel
malts
which
quickly
open
into
big
smoked
malts
with
a
salty
bacon
flavor
that
really
just
lingers
in
the
mouth
moving
into
smoked
duck
flavors
and
then
mellowing
into
meaty
salt
the
aftertaste
rings
with
meaty
salt
and
a
touch
of
hayish
hops
on
the
mouth
the
beer
feels
light
and
almost
watery
on
the
finish
leaving
the
mouth
dry
yet
slightly
sticky
overall
this
is
a
nice
rauchbier
that
i
could
slug
back
a
lot
of
terrific
meaty
flavors
and
wonderful
drinkability
though
i
do
wish
the
mouthfeel
was
a
little
thicker
if
only
because
my
mind
sees
that
as
matching
the
flavors
better
another
great
beer
from
jacks
abby
try
this
beer
eric
hooked
me
up
in
a
great
trade
well
recommended
o
this
is
a
very
tasty
beer
i
wish
i
could
appreciate
some
more
aromas
or
flavors
but
the
aromas
and
flavors
that
are
here
are
very
well
done
this
is
an
extremely
drinkable
beer
especially
for
something
that
tastes
like
smoked
ham
im
completely
sold
on
jacks
abbey
i
had
a
5
minute
love
fest
with
the
clerk
at
the
beer
store
today
about
how
everything
ja
makes
is
good
and
reasonably
priced
mdo
you
have
to
love
it
when
a
beer
exemplifies
a
particular
style
this
well
without
losing
its
soul
of
a
beer
and
this
beer
is
one
of
those
beers
if
you
are
a
fan
of
rauchbiers
try
to
get
this
one
m
its
a
lightmedium
bodied
brew
without
the
smoked
meatiness
it
would
be
crisp
and
light
i
believe
notes
wow
this
one
is
quite
and
experience
and
a
dam
amazing
one
its
bacon
pork
and
wood
in
a
bottle
and
would
make
an
incredible
breakfast
i
will
definitely
pick
this
one
up
again
cheers
taste
starts
smoky
and
sweet
soft
and
fluffy
in
the
middle
and
comes
back
with
the
smoke
and
a
bit
of
hops
bitter
at
the
close
mouthfeel
is
very
smooth
and
drinkability
is
superb
i
always
think
theres
room
for
more
smoke
but
this
one
puts
it
together
well
balanced
yet
doesnt
leave
the
bacon
in
the
pan
cheers
o
this
was
another
great
beer
from
jacks
abby
there
was
a
nice
smokiness
that
paired
well
with
a
nice
juicy
lager
taste
everything
was
nicely
balanced
and
overall
it
was
very
easy
to
drink
i
havent
had
too
many
smoked
beers
but
this
is
definitely
one
of
the
better
ones
ive
had
of
the
style
if
you
like
smokey
flavors
then
i
definitely
recommend
trying
this
o
smoke
doesnt
overpower
as
it
does
in
most
rauchbiers
overall
a
decent
albeit
simple
and
interesting
beer
o
seems
to
be
going
for
a
smoked
helles
lager
and
it
hits
its
mark
intensely
smokey
and
very
authentic
tastes
like
it
could
have
come
from
bamberg
its
right
up
there
with
the
schlenkerla
stuff
overall
decent
beer
nice
smoked
flavors
nice
smoked
meat
and
bacon
like
flavors
esp
a
decent
malt
base
but
seems
a
bit
too
light
overall
for
the
smoked
character
and
the
lager
portion
gets
mostly
drowned
out
but
seeing
as
they
only
make
lagers
its
hard
to
make
a
lager
that
wouldnt
get
drowned
out
by
the
smoke
unless
its
a
big
dark
malty
beer
and
then
not
much
of
a
lager
anyways
overall
one
of
the
better
domestic
rauchbiers
and
except
for
a
bit
of
an
off
taste
at
the
end
this
one
is
very
good
i
do
like
this
better
than
smoke
and
dagger
i
will
be
picking
this
up
again
great
value
rauchbier
pours
a
slightly
hazy
medium
golden
color
with
a
wisp
of
a
white
head
that
never
really
materializes
but
never
really
leaves
either
yup
that
is
a
smokey
aroma
it
smells
like
a
cross
between
a
day
old
campfire
and
old
bacon
with
a
hint
of
melanoid
and
pilsner
malt
the
flavor
is
a
hint
of
sweet
up
front
with
some
grainy
and
sweet
pilsner
malt
able
to
come
forward
before
an
onslaught
of
smokey
meaty
goodness
medium
body
with
a
moderate
level
of
carbonation
and
a
slick
smokey
sweet
mouthfeel
this
is
a
bit
over
the
top
for
my
taste
but
i
can
appreciate
the
greatness
here
this
is
a
really
nice
smoked
beer
with
a
lot
of
complexity
even
if
this
is
not
my
favorite
style
mouthfeel
is
good
light
bodied
crisp
and
a
good
carbonation
level
digging
the
balance
overall
and
its
really
drinkable
overally
a
great
smoked
beer
a
must
try
if
youre
into
the
style
o
a
very
good
rauch
bier
there
is
pleanty
of
smoke
going
on
here
but
it
somehow
keeps
from
being
overbearing
in
a
way
some
beers
of
this
style
infin
to
be
far
to
much
campfire
smoke
going
on
but
this
is
nicley
done
mildly
sour
with
a
dry
nearly
astringent
flavor
the
smoke
is
in
the
backgroundi
applaud
this
as
most
rauchbiers
have
too
much
smoke
starts
like
a
pale
ale
with
a
touch
of
sweetness
thin
bodied
and
highly
carbonated
has
alot
of
hits
and
a
few
big
whiffs
at
the
plate
yet
again
im
starting
to
sound
like
a
broken
record
another
great
beer
by
jacks
abby
if
youre
a
fan
of
aecht
schlenkerla
beers
youll
love
having
a
local
american
version
a
real
winner
here
im
glad
i
picked
up
2
growlers
this
was
definitely
one
of
the
most
meaty
beer
i
have
ever
tried
quite
an
interesting
take
on
the
style
and
worth
a
shot
if
you
can
get
your
hands
on
a
bottle
o
excellent
brew
i
prefer
this
over
the
smoke
and
dagger
almost
tastes
like
a
super
smoky
hoponius
union
in
its
smootheness
try
this
when
you
get
a
chance
its
veganfriendly
as
well
balance
of
smoke
and
base
beer
not
an
easy
thing
to
do
for
some
brewers
the
smoked
malts
lends
some
great
flavors
while
not
killing
the
rest
of
this
beer
this
is
a
highly
quaffable
winner
for
smoked
beer
fans
nice
work
odi
am
very
limited
in
my
rauch
experience
i
am
limited
because
i
dont
really
like
the
style
this
is
quite
cool
and
superunique
i
did
not
love
it
well
crafted
but
not
my
style
i
like
their
smoke
dagger
considerably
more
it
tastes
like
it
should
be
a
beer
that
is
pitch
black
in
color
this
brew
is
a
great
example
of
the
abundance
of
talent
at
jacks
abby
but
this
one
really
isnt
for
me
overall
this
is
a
pretty
simple
beer
super
smoke
flavors
on
top
of
a
solid
lager
base
i
bumped
up
the
overall
score
because
the
taste
was
a
4
25
o
this
is
a
very
wellcrafted
rauchbier
almost
near
the
level
that
schlenkerla
is
on
a
smoky
tasty
fresh
lager
that
is
wonderful
for
the
season
jacks
abby
knows
how
to
make
a
lager
o
i
dig
this
brew
smoked
malt
left
home
alone
to
run
a
muck
in
the
best
possible
way
though
i
liked
blabber
smoke
more
this
is
a
close
2nd
in
the
rauchbier
category
in
my
opinionaccording
to
my
palate
i
will
definitely
be
drinking
this
one
again
this
ones
got
the
look
thats
perfect
considering
the
style
with
a
sweet
and
chocolaty
aroma
the
flavor
remarkable
pulls
off
exactly
as
the
name
implies
its
very
reminiscent
of
tobacco
oak
smoke
and
that
sort
of
citrus
flavor
one
gets
from
flavored
cigars
the
hops
involved
are
somewhat
herbal
in
nature
almost
a
touch
of
menthol
hiding
in
there
one
of
the
most
unique
beverages
ive
ever
experienced
on
tap
at
freebridge
liquors
in
phillipsburg
nj
very
small
pour
but
enough
to
get
a
good
understanding
of
the
beer
this
is
my
first
experience
with
a
rauchbier
and
i
am
a
bit
of
a
newbie
to
smoked
beers
in
general
but
this
was
very
good
an
aromaand
to
some
extent
taste
of
weed
dominates
this
beer
there
is
very
little
orange
flavor
i
found
it
at
the
back
end
but
if
i
wasnt
looking
it
would
have
gone
by
unnoticed
a
very
unique
beer
to
me
and
something
i
would
make
the
effort
to
purchase
on
a
regular
basis
if
i
had
the
chance
the
concept
is
well
executed
and
i
loved
it
for
that
but
a
couple
will
be
enough
i
like
it
much
more
than
most
smoked
beers
but
you
only
get
so
many
beers
in
your
life
it
seems
i
had
a
switched
draft
line
what
i
drank
was
more
like
a
coffee
stout
and
had
neither
orange
nor
smoke
i
was
surprised
at
the
time
given
the
name
but
now
reading
reviews
im
sure
of
it
solid
but
not
much
orange
pours
dark
dark
brown
with
a
tan
leathery
head
swisher
starts
smokey
and
ends
with
a
nice
little
citrus
burst
pretty
interesting
beer
from
a
fresh
growler
fill
from
the
brewery
orange
zest
but
not
in
your
face
amazing
beer
but
i
personally
think
this
beer
shines
on
cask
creamy
with
peat
notes
and
a
body
that
gymnast
fucking
dank
orange
is
a
really
nice
touch
this
year
leather
weed
orange
nice
original
smoke
beer
ive
had
my
share
of
the
sticky
icky
before
in
both
blunt
and
nonblunt
form
so
i
understand
what
carton
was
trying
to
emulate
with
this
beer
it
just
fell
a
little
short
for
me
i
feel
it
could
be
improved
by
dialing
down
the
hops
and
boosting
the
smoked
malts
perhaps
the
thin
body
is
its
biggest
flaw
so
making
it
a
little
more
full
bodied
would
provide
more
support
for
all
of
the
bold
flavors
its
trying
to
achieve
two
thumbs
up
to
carton
for
creativity
just
not
my
favorite
beer
from
them
this
pours
the
color
of
a
wellmade
craft
lager
like
a
clear
goldtan
with
no
hint
at
all
of
the
flavor
explosion
in
store
smells
like
a
campfire
tastes
like
smokey
bandaids
and
if
thats
your
thing
as
it
is
for
me
then
youll
enjoy
it
otherwise
avoid
more
for
me
taste
is
pleasant
and
mild
hint
of
smoke
among
the
malty
grains
very
drinkable
and
a
fresh
twist
on
a
summertime
brew
that
i
wish
more
would
attempt
this
beer
pours
clear
light
amber
color
with
a
frothy
white
head
the
beer
tastes
as
it
sounds
it
is
a
smoked
lager
the
smoke
is
the
domiant
flavor
and
is
still
quite
light
there
is
a
slight
oak
character
as
well
as
a
touch
of
bbq
other
then
the
smoke
this
beer
seems
like
a
plain
old
lager
it
has
a
light
malt
backbone
and
a
subtle
grain
character
the
lager
yeast
is
obvious
and
also
attributes
to
the
flavor
this
beer
is
balanced
easy
drinking
and
pretty
well
done
it
is
also
quite
safe
and
boring
pours
a
clear
light
golden
color
with
a
very
thin
head
that
doesnt
stick
around
for
long
the
nose
is
slightly
smokey
with
a
bit
of
meat
touch
of
malt
in
the
background
flavor
adds
in
a
good
touch
of
smoke
and
hits
the
crisp
malt
quite
well
nice
balance
and
not
overly
smoked
light
to
medium
body
with
good
carbonation
and
a
smokey
finish
tasty
i
like
it
reviewed
on
6242010
on
tap
at
eccentric
cafe
pours
a
clear
orange
with
a
small
white
head
aroma
of
mild
smoke
and
malt
flavor
of
smoke
tons
of
leather
and
tar
very
thin
palate
and
overall
this
was
a
gross
disgusting
beer
and
normally
i
am
a
fan
of
smoked
beers
would
not
recommend
drinkability
this
is
really
good
and
would
be
great
for
outdoor
evenings
from
the
summer
throughout
the
fall
moderate
abv
allows
for
plenty
of
drinking
it
but
i
would
personally
limit
it
after
a
bit
as
the
smokiness
may
become
a
bit
much
after
a
while
solid
though
glad
i
got
to
try
this
unique
beer
the
mouthfeel
and
flavor
of
the
beer
are
both
substantially
better
than
expected
full
bodied
with
a
prominent
spicy
hoppy
character
ip
front
that
is
slowly
countered
by
a
sweet
caramel
malt
backbone
which
has
a
nice
smokey
presence
that
lngers
into
a
long
dry
finish
subtle
hints
of
charcoal
bbq
bacon
campfire
and
butane
the
smokiness
bcomes
more
evident
as
this
beer
mares
and
really
shows
in
the
finish
but
i
wish
it
was
a
touch
more
intense
nicely
balance
bur
not
one
of
the
best
examples
of
he
style
conclusion
the
first
few
sips
of
this
i
was
pretty
sure
i
hated
it
grew
on
me
as
i
drank
it
and
i
reconciled
myself
to
the
fact
that
this
was
not
a
smoked
meat
kind
of
rauchbier
overall
decent
i
might
give
it
another
try
its
a
grainy
sweet
lager
with
wellexecuted
bitterness
the
smoke
flavor
is
strong
and
thoroughly
bambergian
though
more
woody
than
meat
product
thats
a
funny
thing
to
say
about
a
beer
you
might
say
i
always
think
of
those
wonderful
bamberg
rauchbiers
as
bacon
in
a
glass
but
the
smoke
in
this
one
seems
more
like
woodfire
than
smoked
sausage
faint
smoke
on
nose
lite
smoke
on
taste
excellent
i
love
smoked
beer
and
this
one
is
a
real
surprise
it
at
first
seems
very
ordinary
but
the
first
taste
hits
like
it
was
a
beer
brewed
on
the
other
side
of
the
pond
the
brewer
absolutely
nailed
this
one
and
at
4
7
abv
i
could
see
myself
drink
a
lot
of
this
in
the
possible
future
adventurous
style
a
pale
rauchbier
this
looks
like
any
other
belgian
but
things
get
interesting
when
you
bring
it
to
your
lips
big
campfire
nose
the
light
body
cant
quite
stand
up
to
the
fouralarm
smoke
needs
more
of
a
malt
backbone
to
firm
this
one
up
and
give
it
some
ballast
props
for
creativity
though
holy
liquid
smoke
i
felt
like
i
had
been
sitting
near
a
camp
fire
from
the
smells
and
taste
coming
from
my
glass
nose
is
way
too
medicinal
taste
is
peaty
bitter
and
medicinal
finishes
enjoyable
with
a
good
smokey
aftertaste
i
know
this
is
a
rauchbier
but
what
the
heck
is
with
the
medicine
flavor
clearish
medium
amber
pour
into
a
33cl
glass
with
a
small
white
head
that
retained
as
a
small
ringlet
biscuity
malt
aroma
with
a
nice
scent
of
a
fresh
burning
campfire
a
nice
smoky
malt
flavor
here
that
wasnt
too
potent
or
overdone
making
this
an
easydrinking
rauchbier
lesser
notes
of
toasted
bread
and
maybe
a
faint
whisper
of
leafy
hops
it
wasnt
a
fullblown
smoked
ham
like
some
rauchbiers
but
i
think
thats
a
good
thing
i
have
to
kind
of
be
in
the
mood
for
a
smoked
beer
and
even
then
one
is
usually
enough
this
one
was
light
and
palatable
enough
for
me
to
want
to
go
back
for
more
pours
an
amberbrown
color
with
an
eggshell
colored
head
and
good
carbonation
good
lacing
through
consumption
smells
smokey
yet
some
sweetness
is
present
via
the
nose
taste
reveals
some
caramel
or
candy
up
front
and
then
finishes
with
a
long
smokey
flavor
a
definite
favorite
from
victory
drinking
this
from
a
tap
at
goodtago
in
chambersburg
pa
beer
has
a
decent
color
the
taste
is
definitely
a
bit
smoky
and
reminds
me
of
hot
dog
grill
water
but
not
in
a
bad
way
by
any
means
we
dont
have
much
experience
with
smoked
beers
but
this
is
unusual
but
drinkable
overall
what
we
liked
best
about
this
beer
was
the
flavoring
through
the
aftertaste
and
the
creamy
feel
the
smoke
was
pervasive
throughout
adding
depth
to
the
flavoring
and
the
nose
but
it
avoided
becoming
overwhelming
which
we
appreciated
the
beer
remains
light
and
highly
drinkable
and
is
rather
comforting
but
it
does
at
times
border
on
cheapness
may
be
spot
on
for
the
style
i
dont
know
i
can
only
say
for
smoked
beer
its
not
great
in
my
opinion
i
have
used
liquid
smoke
in
cooking
and
thats
what
i
taste
it
gets
a
little
better
as
it
sits
but
still
tough
to
palate
overall
still
trying
to
get
into
these
smoked
beers
this
one
is
good
once
you
start
to
get
through
it
d
boldly
smoky
but
surprisingly
drinkable
the
malty
octoberfest
like
base
works
well
with
the
smoke
and
softens
its
slightly
medicinal
character
definitely
hits
the
sweet
spot
if
bigtime
smoke
is
what
youre
looking
for
but
lacks
the
depth
of
the
aecht
schlenkerla
rauchbiers
a
pint
was
plenty
here
not
bad
though
overall
its
a
bit
too
sweet
for
my
tastes
and
its
light
bodied
but
it
sure
does
feel
true
to
style
and
would
certainly
substitute
for
schlenkerla
nicely
o
enjoyable
beer
wouldnt
mind
having
it
again
the
flavor
is
a
good
example
of
the
style
and
its
pretty
easy
to
get
down
oi
dont
know
what
it
is
but
i
really
like
this
its
just
such
a
unique
taste
and
its
very
full
flavored
i
definitely
wouldnt
mind
having
a
lot
of
this
in
fact
i
might
have
to
come
back
to
this
bar
soon
so
i
can
get
some
more
on
a
guest
tap
at
fatheads
cleveland
a
little
disapointing
as
i
like
anything
smoked
but
still
drinkable
i
was
hoping
to
growler
this
very
smokeand
a
little
too
much
like
inhaling
at
a
public
bbq
not
getting
much
else
complexity
average
mouthfeel
served
at
correct
temperature
it
is
delicious
starts
with
a
burst
of
sweet
toasty
malt
then
fades
into
the
strong
but
not
overpowering
smokiness
that
lingers
like
the
memory
of
bacon
on
an
otherwise
dastardly
morning
it
just
stays
telling
a
story
medium
bodied
a
damn
fine
lager
i
hope
to
see
this
around
ny
a
bit
more
often
o
i
think
this
has
good
drinkability
i
can
see
how
a
lot
of
people
would
not
like
this
style
of
beer
if
you
werent
expecting
the
smokiness
but
i
for
one
really
enjoy
it
overall
i
thought
this
was
a
really
nice
rauchbier
and
i
hop
i
get
a
chance
to
drink
it
again
give
it
a
shot
if
you
come
across
it
pours
a
clear
copper
nice
sized
foam
and
lace
stickage
aroma
of
smoke
cured
meats
and
beechwood
smoked
malt
follows
through
in
the
taste
with
a
nice
smoked
profile
bbq
meats
ham
and
charcoal
beefy
tasty
medium
bodied
feel
good
carbonation
level
overall
a
tasty
rauch
but
not
for
the
faint
palate
there
is
a
very
strong
smoke
flavor
borderline
overwhelming
the
smoke
overpowers
any
sweetness
all
i
taste
is
an
ashy
flavor
honestly
i
dont
really
get
the
appeal
of
rauchbiers
pours
a
clean
yellowish
color
with
a
small
off
white
head
in
the
aroma
bacon
and
smoke
with
hints
of
a
lager
in
there
somewhere
in
the
taste
beef
jerky
and
smoked
pork
a
smooth
and
light
bodied
mouthfeel
with
a
dry
cabin
fire
and
smoked
pork
kind
of
aftertaste
still
a
lager
but
nice
smoke
pretty
damn
nice
this
is
a
beer
with
a
real
smoky
taste
and
smell
the
color
was
orangegold
with
a
light
foamy
head
i
feel
it
would
be
better
consumed
along
with
food
which
i
didnt
have
at
the
time
in
order
to
balance
the
strong
flavors
probably
would
be
good
with
bbq
smoked
salmon
or
strong
cheese
i
could
barely
finish
one
pint
and
did
not
enjoy
it
ill
always
remember
what
a
rauchbier
is
after
this
pour
d
eminently
drinkable
but
the
smoke
builds
up
on
the
palate
a
sipper
for
sure
i
quickly
looked
his
beer
up
on
my
phone
and
it
appeared
to
be
either
new
or
on
tap
only
i
sampled
one
ounce
of
this
and
was
drinking
liquid
smoke
i
could
not
drink
a
full
one
my
friend
is
bold
and
orders
a
tall
goblet
of
scarlet
fire
and
cant
finish
one
on
his
own
so
i
help
him
out
and
review
it
color
is
copperorange
slighty
cloudy
and
the
head
and
lacing
are
like
that
of
wine
so
none
aroma
smoke
i
cant
smell
anything
but
smoke
like
jerky
the
taste
is
only
that
of
smoked
malt
this
beer
is
way
overdone
on
smoked
malt
and
needs
to
go
back
to
formula
sorry
victory
d
the
beer
isnt
that
difficult
to
drink
because
the
smoky
aroma
and
taste
is
not
overpowering
overall
this
wasnt
as
smooth
as
some
of
the
betterknown
smoked
beers
but
i
still
enjoyed
it
worth
a
shot
pours
a
deep
brown
with
a
tan
head
and
a
bit
of
lacing
nose
brings
a
good
dose
of
smoke
and
a
little
bit
of
earth
taste
is
smoky
but
not
overly
so
not
a
huge
amount
of
other
flavors
and
lacking
in
the
leafy
character
of
many
beers
of
the
style
feel
is
fairly
light
and
a
bit
dry
drinks
really
well
with
great
body
and
a
not
overpowering
level
of
smoke
d
not
really
engrossing
enough
for
me
to
revisit
mainly
because
of
its
simplicity
and
watery
character
the
bottom
line
dont
have
to
learn
the
hard
way
not
to
let
this
pass
by
try
it
if
you
have
the
chance
youll
be
grateful
too
get
you
some
before
you
end
up
dead
schlenkerla
marzen
was
the
first
rauch
i
had
and
i
loved
it
i
suppose
i
more
or
less
judge
any
other
rauch
against
that
the
schlenkerla
is
art
a
lot
of
domestics
are
okay
but
offbalanced
with
scarlet
fire
i
found
a
domestic
rauch
thats
very
wellbalanced
not
trying
to
push
any
envelopes
within
the
style
and
crazy
easy
to
drink
overall
a
tasty
smoked
beer
d
the
scarlet
fire
is
an
excellent
smoked
lager
with
a
prominent
but
not
overwhelming
smoke
flavor
easy
to
sip
on
but
not
for
long
term
drinking
good
mouthfeel
with
good
drinkability
glad
i
tried
this
one
but
i
would
not
actively
seek
this
one
out
in
the
future
barely
above
average
overall
this
beer
is
confusing
when
i
first
taste
it
i
think
medium
bodied
but
by
the
time
i
swallow
i
think
it
was
quite
watery
there
isnt
really
any
bitterness
or
sweetness
to
it
some
moderate
to
low
body
in
the
front
and
it
finishes
cleanly
some
of
the
smoke
character
is
left
as
a
late
or
even
a
slight
aftertaste
and
the
smoke
builds
the
more
you
drink
overall
its
a
pretty
decent
rauchbier
could
use
some
beefing
up
though
this
guys
been
a
want
since
i
learned
it
existed
luckily
for
me
churchkeys
draft
list
is
badass
the
pour
results
in
a
clear
copperamber
with
about
half
a
finger
of
white
foam
on
top
good
start
right
well
the
honeymoon
ends
when
i
smell
the
thing
whatever
is
there
is
very
faint
unlike
any
rauch
or
smoked
beer
ive
had
before
theres
a
tinge
of
smokiness
as
though
the
grill
wasnt
working
properly
theres
also
an
intimation
of
wheat
thats
about
it
the
taste
comes
off
similarly
theres
a
light
smoked
ham
flavor
along
with
some
wheat
bread
and
a
vague
dull
bitterness
frankly
according
to
my
tongue
this
is
one
of
the
weakest
smoky
beers
ive
ever
had
that
said
its
not
badtasting
just
not
what
it
claims
to
be
the
body
is
pretty
light
with
moderate
carbonation
and
a
smooth
and
moist
feel
honestly
not
a
bad
brew
overall
but
i
expected
better
from
victory
dthis
has
a
nice
smokey
presence
toit
with
a
good
balance
of
sweetness
from
the
malts
and
hops
in
the
back
has
some
good
stuff
going
on
here
pours
a
clear
ruby
red
good
carbonation
smells
of
attractive
hickory
smoked
flavor
bartender
said
this
was
a
one
off
but
it
smells
tastes
great
wish
they
would
offer
this
more
flavor
id
almost
liken
the
malts
and
taste
to
are
flavors
on
a
bbq
grill
with
ham
or
rib
flavor
excellent
for
any
beer
drinker
who
loves
ribs
wings
or
any
bbq
i
really
like
this
wish
i
could
get
a
sixer
i
can
see
if
some
are
turned
off
as
this
one
probably
has
a
smaller
audience
than
most
beers
mesquite
smoke
aroma
taste
is
similar
smoke
with
a
carolina
tangmemphis
sweet
hybrid
bbq
sauce
mish
mash
sweetness
underlying
fruit
which
seems
out
of
place
pharmaceutical
huskiness
with
swallow
mouthfeel
is
a
little
juicy
really
drinkable
i
downed
my
pint
in
no
time
good
beer
overall
the
smoked
ham
aftertaste
really
lingers
in
my
mouth
and
makes
it
salivate
and
because
of
this
dominating
taste
does
not
get
high
marks
from
me
for
drinkability
i
was
intrigued
to
try
it
when
i
read
the
description
of
this
brew
but
probably
wouldnt
get
it
again
unless
it
was
paired
well
with
a
meal
poured
into
a
tulip
from
a
growler
obtained
yesterday
and
kept
in
the
fridge
pours
a
dark
caramel
redamber
with
a
fingerwidth
head
with
substantial
retention
aroma
is
caramel
toffee
some
bready
malt
and
a
suggestion
of
smokiness
from
the
smoked
malt
mouthfeel
is
mediumbodied
with
medium
carbonation
not
too
heavy
in
anticipation
of
watching
some
afcnfc
championship
football
the
taste
however
is
a
different
story
taste
is
caramel
toffee
wholegrain
bread
toast
light
charcoal
and
a
light
astringent
smokiness
i
expected
a
dark
roasty
smokiness
from
this
beer
but
the
smoke
is
merely
a
background
note
no
hop
presence
to
speak
of
overall
this
beer
is
not
one
i
would
try
again
i
saw
smoked
malt
on
the
victory
brewpub
menu
and
after
trying
stones
smoked
porter
i
have
to
try
any
smoked
beer
next
time
i
will
be
more
discerning
drinkability
as
for
drinkability
this
is
a
fine
beer
but
more
of
a
curiosity
for
me
i
dont
mind
the
smoky
flavor
and
would
drink
it
again
if
offered
but
i
dont
think
this
is
a
preferred
style
for
me
so
i
wont
go
out
of
my
way
to
have
it
again
i
think
for
me
this
a
good
representative
of
an
unusual
style
but
not
something
i
feel
the
need
to
seek
out
and
have
again
0
4
litre
glass
at
the
brewpub
pours
a
clear
golden
amber
color
with
thin
white
head
aroma
was
kind
of
week
not
as
smokey
as
i
would
like
flavor
was
also
weak
watered
down
with
only
a
faint
hint
of
smoked
malt
very
disappointing
this
beer
poured
a
golden
color
with
a
slight
redness
to
it
the
carbonation
was
too
much
and
resulted
in
a
nice
enough
head
but
nothing
really
note
worthy
the
aroma
had
a
smokiness
that
couldnt
be
missed
and
a
sweet
maltiness
that
pretty
much
dominated
any
real
hop
complexity
the
taste
was
a
very
upfront
smokiness
that
i
thought
was
more
aggressive
than
the
sly
fox
rauch
still
a
very
well
balanced
beer
overall
this
was
an
odd
one
for
me
not
bad
at
all
just
very
different
the
spiciness
of
the
profile
really
took
me
off
guard
on
here
i
would
have
no
issue
with
trying
this
one
again
it
was
just
a
bit
weird
is
all
leave
it
to
victory
to
nail
another
german
styleawesome
just
awesome
take
on
this
one
notesgreat
balance
and
a
really
good
beer
i
liked
it
and
i
really
did
not
detect
any
sausage
flavor
or
meat
taste
i
dont
think
i
would
have
minded
though
overalli
will
have
this
again
pours
a
clear
amber
fairly
mild
smoked
nose
flavor
is
a
nice
meaty
smoked
thing
nice
pronounced
flavor
nice
ride
for
the
tongue
well
balanced
on
the
smoke
feel
is
good
drinkability
is
high
this
is
a
rauch
that
more
than
the
average
person
could
go
on
theres
no
abrasive
smoke
on
it
and
its
well
balanced
enough
that
you
can
quickly
go
through
it
d
this
is
a
good
beer
but
the
smokiness
sort
of
limits
its
drinkabilitysessionability
still
i
enjoyed
it
and
would
order
again
its
just
not
something
i
could
drink
a
lot
of
i
love
bbq
real
bbq
slow
smoked
pork
but
had
a
real
hard
time
with
this
beer
too
smoky
no
complexity
if
you
like
smoked
beers
you
will
like
this
one
but
im
not
liking
smoked
beers
so
i
dont
like
this
one
d
i
have
been
drinking
this
beer
since
it
went
on
draft
at
friscos
wont
quit
until
its
gone
the
beer
poured
a
clear
dark
amber
with
a
thin
white
head
into
a
pint
glass
a
slightly
sweet
smell
of
yeast
with
no
discernable
smoky
aroma
a
very
nice
smoke
flavor
not
overpowering
with
a
very
smooth
finish
with
a
very
low
hop
profile
very
refreshing
and
drinkable
an
accurate
representation
of
the
rauchbier
style
in
my
opinion
tried
this
on
tap
at
tria
pours
a
hazy
rust
like
color
had
a
slight
smell
of
burnt
wood
chip
soaked
in
chick
pea
brine
the
taste
was
that
of
a
four
day
old
italian
hoagie
covered
in
liquid
smoke
not
for
me
at
all
it
was
tought
to
get
down
but
good
for
the
style
i
just
dont
like
rauchbier
the
taste
haunts
me
just
beyond
accurate
description
i
am
eager
for
another
d
this
is
a
good
alternativfe
to
a
marzen
style
especially
coming
out
of
the
winter
months
it
remind
you
that
bbq
weather
is
around
the
corner
alway
a
good
style
with
grilled
sausage
and
the
like
and
this
is
spot
on
this
is
an
easy
drinking
rauch
with
a
well
blended
smoke
flavor
it
arrived
with
a
big
offwhite
head
that
slowly
reduced
to
a
light
coating
of
wisps
the
color
was
a
hazy
lightorange
the
nose
had
a
great
smoky
sweetness
to
it
not
unlike
hickorysmoked
bacon
if
that
is
your
thing
its
definitely
mine
the
mouthfeel
was
on
the
thin
side
but
it
still
had
a
nice
effervescence
i
really
got
a
jolt
of
smoke
on
the
tongue
and
the
lingering
smokiness
on
the
finish
was
just
what
i
had
dreamt
about
smoke
em
if
youve
got
em
boys
and
girls
i
applaud
victory
for
keeping
things
new
and
exciting
and
also
going
smoke
free
as
of
this
past
week
d
very
drinkable
with
a
low
abv
check
this
out
while
it
lasts
and
enjoy
a
bit
of
bamberg
in
pennsylvania
dutch
country
for
the
record
this
was
the
first
time
ive
tried
this
style
and
while
many
say
its
an
acquired
taste
i
must
have
acquired
it
right
then
and
there
my
fiancee
who
isnt
a
huge
beer
drinker
also
found
this
to
be
quite
enjoyable
did
pair
well
with
a
buffalo
chicken
pizza
and
chicken
cheese
steak
overall
a
very
drinkable
brew
i
would
have
liked
a
bit
more
smokiness
in
the
aroma
but
flavors
were
right
on
the
mark
not
over
powering
like
a
lot
of
the
smoked
beers
a
nice
soft
balance
with
the
hops
in
the
role
of
complementing
the
malts
another
nice
job
from
victory
of
a
little
seen
style
in
the
states
nothing
like
a
pint
of
liquid
beef
jerky
on
an
empty
stomach
i
think
to
myself
as
i
now
belch
up
some
smoky
goodness
it
poured
a
dark
copperamber
color
with
a
thin
head
that
was
gone
before
i
even
started
drinking
granted
i
let
the
beer
sit
for
a
while
first
it
smelled
of
malt
and
sticky
caramel
the
taste
was
surprisingly
mild
for
the
malty
smell
and
full
of
smoky
flavor
it
finished
with
a
slight
bitterness
that
only
lasted
a
second
this
beer
was
very
light
and
very
drinkable
i
could
have
easily
had
more
if
only
i
had
more
to
eat
first
it
would
have
gone
great
with
smoked
gouda
although
i
will
admit
not
to
be
a
huge
fan
of
this
style
i
was
pleasantly
surprised
when
one
of
our
locals
montys
krown
lounge
rochester
ny
wrangled
a
host
of
victory
offerings
recently
a
very
nicely
balanced
smokiness
that
fades
as
the
pint
goes
down
altogether
extremely
pleasant
quaffing
experience
ive
been
told
that
authentic
german
rauches
a
much
more
smoky
to
the
point
of
chewing
on
charcoal
which
is
probably
why
this
is
not
a
huge
style
category
even
in
the
fatherland
this
little
tipple
is
most
likely
a
good
entre
into
the
style
i
will
probably
seek
out
a
few
more
for
investigation
and
experimentation
552
very
clear
reddish
beer
not
as
smokey
as
one
might
expect
the
taste
seems
to
mostly
come
from
the
hops
sort
of
a
hop
devil
lite
very
drinkable
and
enjoyable
nuanced
from
what
i
have
observed
its
a
crowd
pleaser
maybe
its
the
name
but
lots
of
people
are
attracted
to
trying
it
and
they
like
it
a
lot
draught
victorys
brewpub
light
copper
in
color
not
much
head
taste
may
be
a
hair
lighter
than
some
of
their
other
beers
but
this
still
has
a
full
maltiness
as
well
as
a
little
smokiness
to
it
a
fine
session
beer
another
beer
to
make
the
trip
there
worthwhile
prost
o
it
has
the
makings
of
a
great
rauchbier
i
loved
the
aroma
and
the
initial
flavor
was
good
i
didnt
like
the
dry
bitter
finish
o
this
definitely
wasnt
my
bag
the
chemicalband
aide
affect
in
the
taste
left
a
lot
to
be
desired
pleasent
to
smell
not
so
much
to
taste
didnt
finish
the
bottle
22
ounce
bottle
served
in
a
mug
the
beer
pours
a
slightly
hazy
orangeamberbrown
color
with
a
half
inch
light
tan
head
that
fizzled
away
pretty
quickly
not
much
lacing
at
all
aroma
is
pretty
much
all
smoked
meatsmalt
bacon
along
with
a
bit
of
wood
the
taste
is
similar
to
the
aroma
it
tastes
mostly
like
smoked
maltmeats
and
theres
also
some
wood
and
an
apple
juice
flavor
noticeable
too
mouthfeelbody
is
medium
its
a
bit
slick
and
coating
with
a
decent
amount
of
carbonation
i
think
its
a
solid
brew
its
definitely
worth
trying
tried
hard
but
couldnt
enjoy
it
i
dont
know
if
the
word
bacon
on
the
label
messed
with
my
head
but
the
first
hickory
filled
sip
had
me
thinking
a
slice
of
bacon
had
slipped
into
the
bottle
had
to
pour
out
the
rest
and
move
on
to
a
beer
of
known
quality
andor
likability
overall
i
am
impressed
with
this
beer
i
am
a
big
fan
of
rauchbiers
and
this
one
did
not
disappoint
i
wonderful
hearty
beer
perfect
for
a
cold
evening
just
not
the
beer
for
me
i
can
appreciate
the
concept
and
the
attempt
the
final
result
leaves
me
wanting
more
than
it
can
deliver
one
pour
is
enough
and
then
time
to
move
on
d
very
high
drinkability
for
me
very
happy
i
have
another
one
the
taste
isnt
too
heavy
but
the
smell
is
dank
i
am
very
glad
this
one
delivered
bacon
beer
baby
glad
i
git
to
try
this
but
pretty
rough
to
put
down
after
a
few
sips
mouthfeel
drinkability
the
body
of
the
beer
is
just
shy
of
medium
i
think
a
little
less
fizzyness
would
improve
the
drinkability
i
would
certainly
grab
another
bottle
of
this
should
i
see
it
great
bang
for
the
buck
at
5
00
a
bomber
drinkability
a
nice
meal
in
a
bottle
one
bomber
satisfys
md
mouthfeel
is
about
perfect
coats
the
tongue
but
still
light
and
goes
down
smoothly
very
drinkable
for
the
style
and
worth
a
look
for
rauchbier
fans
keep
making
em
and
ill
keep
drinking
em
not
a
huge
fan
of
smoked
beverages
other
than
alaskas
smoked
porter
and
a
few
other
smoked
porters
so
i
was
surprised
when
i
found
myself
enjoying
this
more
than
i
expected
to
smells
like
smoked
bacon
right
off
the
bat
for
me
it
marries
well
with
the
bock
style
very
impressed
d
definitely
something
i
would
like
to
get
again
i
think
i
could
drink
a
few
pints
of
this
and
try
to
figure
it
out
a
little
better
overall
a
decent
beer
worth
trying
i
dont
know
of
another
locallybrewed
rauchbier
tastes
very
smoky
kinda
like
you
put
brown
ale
and
hickory
beef
jerky
in
a
blender
its
not
bad
fun
beer
to
try
when
i
first
heard
about
this
beer
i
went
crazy
with
excitement
i
love
the
fall
and
the
smell
of
bonfires
i
drank
this
beer
out
of
a
pint
glass
it
has
a
deep
amber
color
with
a
strong
head
but
when
put
against
the
light
you
can
see
the
lightness
to
it
a
very
cool
color
the
smell
was
amazing
i
felt
like
i
was
sitting
next
to
a
bonfire
however
after
finishing
half
my
glass
i
was
about
done
the
after
taste
of
burning
wood
overwhelmed
the
overal
positive
taste
of
the
beer
which
was
moderate
at
first
but
then
got
way
too
strong
a
huge
fan
of
samuel
adams
and
their
autumn
harvest
beers
i
was
disappinted
by
this
will
be
sticking
to
octoberfest
and
harvest
pumpkin
for
the
fall
season
from
sa
btw
i
like
bacon
but
this
was
somethign
else
although
its
been
well
over
a
year
since
i
last
tasted
this
gem

poured
out
as
a

with
a
fizzy
cream
colored
head
on
top
that
had
a
pretty
good
retention
the
lacing
was
very
minimal
the
smell
of
the
beer
was
lightly
smoked
with
i
liked
there
was
enough
smoke
in
there
to
tell
you
its
a
rauch

not
too
much
that
it
makes
me
wanna
gag
the
taste
was

nicely
balanced

the

this

the

is
a

not
too
bad
not
my
top
pick
of
the
sam
adams
beers
but
i
think
this
one
would
be
a
great
one
to
drink
on
a
night
when
the
air
gets
that
first
chill
of
fall
in
it
since
that
time
is
almost
here
i
look
forward
to
trying
this
one
again

not
bad
as
the
name
suggests
if
maybe
a
little
too
moderate
for
such
an
outthere
style
of
beer
this
is
a
great
rauchbier
to
give
people
who
have
never
had
rauchbier
before
im
glad
that
despite
their
size
and
profile
that
sam
adams
is
still
doing
interesting
things
with
their
beers
and
making
styles
that
may
not
appeal
to
a

52this
is
the
shortest
review
ive
written
this
beer
completely
rubbed
me
the
wrong
way
the
fact
that
it
probably
wont
rate
as
the
worst
beer
ive
reviewed
is
a
testament
to
how
bad
some
other
beers
can
be
but
still
darker
than
your
usual
ale
the
first
sip
tastes
of
smoked
wood
immediately
followed
by
heavy
malt
the
mouthfeel
reflects
this
flavor
very
heavy
and
coats
your
entire
mouth
if
you
are
a
fan
of
the
smoke
variety

enjoyed
in
snifter
this
smoked
bock
pours
a
brilliant
hazy
copper
with
a
firm
white
head
and
nice
lacing
nose
of
smoked
malts
caramel
raisins
and
more
smoke
flavors
of
sweet
caramel
up
front
very
rich
moderate
smoke
to
the
aftertaste
with
figs
and
raisins
alcoholic
warming
and
lots
of
smoke
with
age
the
smoke
dissipates
but
still
pretty
strong
with
a
goodly
mouth
feel
very
wet
but
coating
decent
big
but
decent
body
is
full
lighter
carbonation
o
the
smoke
is
big
throughout
making
it
hard
to
drink
the
entire
bomber
however
it
paired
nicely
with
some
brick
cheese
and
summer
sausage
i
think
this
style
is
better
tackled
with
some
food
overall
worth
a
try
thanks
brother
atmosphere
is
okay
nice
foamy
head
but
no
real
lacing
nose
is
roasty
and
bacony
malt
grains
smoked
in
peat
balanced
with
bitter
and
some
odd
sweetness
overall
this
is
an
okay
quaff
thank
you
beeradvocate
for
maintaining
this
site
its
valuable
to
me
and
very
much
appreciated
great
brew
high
abv
and
you
can
definetely
taste
it
i
have
not
had
any
true
rauchbiers
but
this
one
tastes
like
a
great
cross
betweens
sa
doublebock
and
wee
heavy
which
i
freaking
love
the
smoke
is
there
not
overpowering
like
in
a
wee
heavy
but
enough
to
give
the
beer
a
nice
flavor
i
let
this
brew
sit
out
1
hour
before
i
drank
it
and
it
was
very
tasty
o
a
pretty
darn
good
beer
i
really
view
this
more
as
a
doppelbock
w
some
smoke
rather
than
a
rauch
very
suprised
its
ranked
as
low
as
it
is
not
quite
as
good
as
sam
adams
double
bock
but
its
still
a
quality
beer
lots
of
taste
lots
of
power
and
pairs
well
with
food
highly
recommend
for
any
fans
of
bocksdoppelbocks
or
extreme
beers
o
kind
of
a
miss
on
this
one
not
special
pretty
good
overall
but
a
bit
too
sweet
for
my
taste
i
enjoyed
the
smoke
though
poured
into
ceramic
stein
allowed
head
to
develop
and
stayed
for
a
good
while
overall
a
curious
and
unique
melding
of
styles
but
not
of
the
caliber
as
the
schlenkerla
rauchbiers
overall
i
probably
wouldnt
buy
it
again
but
sometimes
the
sam
single
bottles
are
surprisingly
good
just
not
this
one
samuel
adams
cinder
bock
is
a
very
clear
dense
copper
beer
with
a
soft
fluffy
yellowed
foam
that
has
great
staying
power
its
mostly
smoke
in
the
aroma
but
a
tart
malt
is
detected
as
well
it
smells
a
touch
sweet
its
very
full
bodied
and
smooth
with
a
creamy
chewy
finish
the
flavor
is
much
like
the
the
aroma
smoke
and
tart
malt
theres
a
slightly
sweet
herbal
flavor
thats
somewhere
between
cola
and
a
cough
drop
smoke
is
the
dominant
flavor
here
when
combined
with
the
malt
it
comes
off
as
umami
theres
a
sort
of
salmiakki
aftertaste
this
is
reasonably
bold
and
complex
its
a
sipping
beer
with
a
lot
of
character
there
are
subtleties
to
it
but
the
overall
flavor
is
quite
bold
not
sure
how
old
this
is
but
i
think
batch
1s
smoke
has
faded
o
if
i
have
to
taste
band
aids
this
is
the
least
offensive
of
the
kinds
but
it
grows
stronger
and
stronger
with
each
sip
i
think
there
is
a
tasty
beer
in
this
bottle
with
nice
hints
of
malt
sweetness
but
it
is
well
hidden
in
the
loud
salty
bacon
band
aid
flavors
it
was
a
bit
to
rough
to
finish
overall
pretty
good
its
also
dangerously
drinkable
for
nearly
10
overall
i
really
liked
this
beer
i
actually
happen
to
like
peat
smoked
beer
and
it
is
very
hard
to
find
and
this
beer
has
a
good
balance
of
smoked
peat
and
a
caramelized
malt
that
i
love
i
would
buy
again
if
i
can
find
it
overall
this
is
a
rather
enjoyable
brew
it
has
a
good
blend
of
toast
smoke
sweet
nut
and
booze
with
a
chewy
and
thick
body
that
suits
the
flavors
rather
nicely
i
poured
this
beer
into
a
glass
it
has
a
red
amber
color
body
with
a
2
tan
creamy
head
to
it
the
aroma
is
of
a
smoky
malty
ness
to
it
the
taste
has
a
rich
deep
smoke
flavor
followed
by
a
sweetness
malt
on
the
back
of
the
tongue
the
mouth
feel
is
bold
and
full
it
grips
the
taste
bud
very
well
with
the
smokyness
and
sweetness
overall
this
is
a
really
good
beer
great
flavor
and
balance
great
job
saumel
adams
o
this
beer
definitely
feels
somewhat
filling
like
a
doppelbock
but
manages
to
hide
its
alcohol
extremely
well
its
a
good
selection
if
you
want
something
that
is
like
a
meal
in
itself
but
isnt
too
smoky
beer
is
heavy
in
body
with
carbonation
of
medium
intensity
leading
to
a
slightly
fizzy
mouthfeel
that
foams
up
quickly
leading
to
a
latterhalf
feel
that
is
smooth
and
somewhat
creamy
ethanol
can
be
felt
in
the
nostrils
and
back
of
throat
which
is
somewhat
disappointing
given
the
malt
intensity
in
this
beer
sweet
smokiness
all
the
way
through
from
the
nose
through
the
taste
like
backyard
barbeque
brisket
thats
been
smoking
under
coats
of
sauce
all
day
nice
creamy
head
deep
red
color
not
a
taste
id
want
all
the
time
but
a
good
beer
in
that
style
sweetens
dramatically
as
it
warms
overall
good
beer
but
it
could
be
a
little
less
sweet
o
was
pretty
surprised
how
easily
this
is
to
drink
and
the
sweetness
at
the
end
this
has
been
one
of
the
best
bocks
i
have
tried
and
if
i
saw
this
on
tap
i
would
venture
to
try
it
again
the
smoke
and
initial
taste
on
this
is
kinda
strange
but
when
the
aftertaste
hits
it
starts
to
become
pleasant
beer
is
medium
in
body
a
little
sweet
a
little
smoky
not
over
the
top
a
decent
beer
by
my
estimation
the
finish
is
nice
as
well
not
dry
id
consider
having
it
again
o
a
bit
too
smokey
for
my
taste
but
certainly
not
over
the
top
for
a
rauchbier
glad
i
tried
it
its
good
but
not
great
nice
ruby
color
but
no
head
to
speak
of
my
main
impression
is
that
this
is
a
very
sweet
bock
the
smell
is
sugary
instead
of
smokynot
idealand
the
base
beer
is
also
too
much
caramel
and
booze
for
me
nice
hickorybeech
smoke
but
i
would
turn
the
sweetsticky
characteristics
down
a
lot
before
i
would
drink
this
beer
again
glad
to
see
the
attempt
at
the
style
though
in
summary
a
promising
nose
that
leads
to
disappointment
in
the
mouth
my
best
suggestion
would
be
to
dry
it
out
some
more
by
about
20
with
additional
noble
hopping
so
that
the
malts
present
less
like
a
milk
chocolate
bar
with
a
pile
of
cigarette
ash
on
top
the
breadiness
that
exists
needs
to
be
brought
into
the
foreground
and
accentuated
with
the
smoke
id
give
this
one
a
pass
unless
you
are
morbidly
curious
what
controlled
cellaring
smoke
degradation
would
do
for
it
i
poured
from
a
bomber
into
a
tulip
dark
pour
with
a
very
large
white
head
light
lacing
ton
of
smoke
on
the
nose
lots
of
roasted
smokey
flavors
thick
and
chewey
full
bodied
good
carbonation
the
9
abv
is
well
hidden
a
very
enjoyable
rauch
beer
from
sa
this
was
possibly
my
most
anticipated
of
the
single
batch
releases
thus
far
save
for
verloren
lets
get
our
smoke
on
shall
we
this
stuff
pours
a
clear
russetamber
topped
by
a
finger
of
ashy
cream
foam
the
nose
comprises
mild
beech
smoke
light
caramel
and
a
twinge
of
cocoa
the
taste
is
a
surprising
barrage
of
sweetness
with
caramel
light
cocoa
and
buttercream
melding
with
some
mildthoughsubstantial
booze
to
form
a
harsh
assault
on
the
tongue
throughout
a
vein
of
mild
smoke
pervades
a
mixture
of
hickory
and
beech
but
it
never
comes
close
to
even
matching
the
sweetness
nor
does
it
ever
get
to
stand
on
its
own
the
body
is
a
light
medium
with
a
light
moderate
carbonation
a
lightly
syrupy
feel
and
a
fairly
dry
finish
overall
a
decent
rauchbier
but
one
that
comes
across
too
sweet
and
notsmokyenough
for
its
own
good
i
love
a
good
smoked
beer
this
one
is
a
dark
amber
color
with
an
offwhite
head
nice
clarity
the
aroma
is
fantastic
campfire
wood
smoke
charcoal
and
some
underlying
roasty
malts
sweet
at
the
foretaste
with
more
malt
character
great
balance
this
beer
avoids
the
pitfalls
of
a
lot
of
smoked
beers
that
is
its
not
hollow
astringent
or
acrid
its
a
really
enjoyable
and
well
made
smoked
beer
great
body
and
very
easy
to
drink
sorry
jim
this
is
not
my
idea
of
a
rauchbier
proper
a
bruiser
of
a
bock
sure
a
lot
of
flame
but
no
meatiness
that
id
enjoy
it
didnt
blend
overall
pretty
rich
and
tasty
would
go
great
with
cheese
and
snack
foods
o
these
sa
small
batch
beers
have
been
pretty
damn
hit
or
miss
havent
they
this
was
pretty
bad
to
the
point
where
i
couldnt
finish
it
hell
i
needed
something
to
clean
my
damn
palate
with
just
to
get
the
taste
of
fart
out
of
my
mouth
on
the
plus
side
its
a
few
tweaks
away
from
being
ok
so
uh
keep
at
it
sam
adams
i
guess
this
beer
started
out
well
but
lost
its
lustre
as
consumption
contunued
im
not
exactly
sure
what
it
is
perhaps
the
yeast
im
not
a
fan
of
belgian
beers
and
this
seemed
to
have
some
of
those
belgian
taste
qualities
i
certianly
dont
get
any
rauch
flavors
as
the
style
catagory
would
suggest
oi
had
it
with
marshmallow
makes
sense
right
smoky
cmpfire
beer
and
a
marshmallow
dont
you
judge
me
not
a
bad
beer
from
what
id
consider
an
overrated
brewer
loose
around
the
edges
but
not
a
bad
beer
high
abv
thats
reasonably
well
hidden
you
can
smell
and
taste
the
abv
but
it
kind
of
sneaks
up
on
you
overall
between
average
and
good
pours
a
two
finger
cream
head
that
fades
to
a
ring
leaving
some
lace
nice
crystal
clear
amber
color
medium
carbonation
and
medium
bodied
smoky
nose
and
flavor
is
sweet
peat
and
some
smoke
would
go
well
with
a
barbeque
higher
abv
is
hidden
7

for
a
22oz
bottle
from
tullys
beer
wine
wells
me
wonderfully
creamy
and
smooth
mouthfeel
overall
a
really
tasty
beverage
but
not
quite
smoky
enough
for
me
to
consider
this
a
true
rauchbeer
overall
probably
a
bit
much
but
a
good
overall
beer
nice
one
sam
overall
interesting
beer
i
could
not
see
myself
drinking
alot
of
this
but
it
was
definitely
worth
trying
6913
update
aged
a
second
bottle
for
nearly
a
year
hasnt
changed
very
much
perhaps
a
little
less
smokiness
and
heat
balance
is
very
good
give
it
another
05
10
overall
beautiful
dark
amber
color
in
the
glass
with
an
off
white
head
that
settles
to
a
thin
layer
of
film
with
some
lace
the
aroma
is
a
bit
light
but
i
do
get
a
solid
caramel
malt
base
with
a
touch
of
sweetness
on
top
of
that
reminiscent
of
ripe
fruit
the
whole
thing
is
tied
together
by
a
touch
of
light
smokiness
not
a
campfire
smoke
but
a
nice
sweet
smokiness
the
taste
is
sweet
bready
malt
somewhat
thick
with
a
bit
of
the
alcohol
apparent
the
smoke
is
right
there
too
my
first
thought
was
of
bacon
or
at
least
the
smell
and
taste
of
smoked
bacon
that
thought
fades
but
only
slightly
as
the
meaty
character
does
persist
this
is
a
pretty
thick
beer
as
the
carbonation
is
low
and
it
has
a
drying
smoky
finish
with
the
evident
alcohol
overall
this
is
definitely
interesting
im
not
a
huge
fan
of
rauchbiers
but
the
smoke
in
this
one
is
balanced
pretty
well
with
by
a
good
malt
character
and
the
high
alcohol
content
seems
to
help
too
if
only
the
smoke
character
wasnt
as
meaty
i
think
this
beer
would
be
more
enjoyable
i
think
this
would
go
good
with
some
ribs
and
cornbread
definitely
not
something
to
quaff
more
of
a
sipper
to
go
along
with
a
nice
dark
churchill
on
the
deck
a
good
starting
spot
with
some
smaller
improvements
this
could
be
really
good
rjt
good
not
must
have
mouthfeel
this
is
a
very
smooth
and
easy
drinking
beer
but
it
has
a
richness
to
the
mouthfeel
that
makes
it
even
better
drinking
than
a
lot
of
bocks
that
tend
to
be
on
the
heavy
side
o
while
i
am
not
one
to
leave
a
glass
unemptied
i
am
not
terribly
impressed
this
is
nothing
i
would
seek
out
again
in
the
future
o
tasty
goes
down
easily
not
too
filling
good
kick
good
representation
of
style
this
is
a
solid
smoked
beer
to
drink
for
a
while
if
youre
in
the
mood
for
the
style
decide
to
try
something
different
with
this
review
since
there
is
two
suggested
glasses
i
thought
it
would
be
fun
to
try
this
beer
in
both
glasses
mug
and
stange
appearance
is
the
same
for
aroma
i
prefer
the
aroma
in
the
stange
and
for
the
taste
and
mouthfeel
there
is
no
difference
i
cannot
wait
to
try
the
other
beers
in
this
same
batch
series
from
sam
adams
o
not
too
shabby
but
overall
not
something
id
buy
again

up
improves
this
beer
a
lot
really
allowing
the
smoke
to
come
out
moved
the
smell
and
taste
scores
up
12
point
each
because
of
it
though
they
are
still
down
from
the
competition
this
was
the
most
unusual
and
unpleasant
flavor
i
have
ever
tasted
in
a
beer
way
too
smoky
for
my
taste
while
i
love
many
of
the
sam
adams
varieties
this
beer
is
among
my
least
favorites
i
would
definitely
not
recommend
this
one
the
abv
at
9
4
is
enticing
but
the
flavor
is
a
turnoff
d
nicely
done
it
is
a
touch
too
sweet
for
my
taste
and
this
element
becomes
a
bit
cloying
towards
the
end
however
the
smoke
is
nice
and
the
dark
malt
works
well
with
it
not
quite
schlenkerla
but
a
good
attempt
overall
sweeter
than
others
i
have
had
which
doesnt
really
balance
the
beer
but
makes
it
different
from
others
i
have
had
in
the
genre
kind
of
forgettable
for
the
style
pretty
much
what
one
would
expect
from
reading
any
reviews
of
rauchbier
but
not
really
a
great
example
of
the
style
the
high
abv
for
such
a
low
price
helps
out
but
really
not
even
a
good
introductory
beer
for
the
style
certainly
not
a
session
beer
o
a
strange
beer
but
still
enjoyable
i
bet
this
will
pair
well
with
rich
cheeses
couldnt
drink
this
on
a
regular
basis
but
would
make
a
nice
session
beer
in
the
middle
of
winter
poured
a
1
5
rusty
beige
head
of
medium
life
the
body
is
burnt
umber
brown
in
masstone
but
a
nice
deep
amber
held
to
the
light
it
smells
of
rich
malt
and
mild
smoke
then
the
taste
flips
that
around
with
medium
rich
malt
and
dominant
smoke
ive
had
a
few
other
smoked
beers
and
while
others
have
that
deep
porterlike
belly
satisfaction
this
one
i
find
more
of
a
refreshing
easy
drinking
version
i
quite
liked
it
and
its
one
of
the
better
limited
release
experiments
from
the
makers
of
sam
so
i
dont
quite
get
why
it
didnt
score
better
with
others
overall
i
enjoyed
it
but
i
would
definitely
only
drink
about
68
ounces
of
it
before
it
became
sickly
sweet
worth
a
try
though
cheers
nice
effort
from
sam
adams
it
has
all
the
makings
of
a
great
smoked
beer
but
this
thick
and
oily
9
45
abv
brew
is
just
a
bit
too
much
for
my
tastes
o
overall
strong
malt
presence
mid
level
amount
of
smokiness
more
malty
sweet
generally
easy
to
consume
with
a
alcohol
that
will
creep
up
on
you
poured
into
a
large
brandy
snifter
pours
clear
dark
amber
with
a
tall
biege
head
that
dissipates
at
a
moderate
pace
some
lacing
is
left
on
the
side
of
the
glass
as
the
head
dissipates
some
bubbles
can
be
seen
rising
from
the
bottom
of
the
glass
not
much
head
is
left
at
the
top
after
dissipation
mild
smokiness
hits
the
nose
up
front
there
are
sweet
malts
and
some
hops
in
the
aroma
as
well
the
smokiness
is
more
intense
in
the
flavor
than
it
was
in
the
aroma
it
has
a
sweet
malt
background
with
spicy
hops
its
well
balanced
with
some
alcohol
taste
even
for
8
4
the
flavors
are
balanced
enough
to
prevent
this
from
tasting
too
boozy
i
find
i
get
used
to
the
smokiness
as
i
continue
drinking
this
beer
the
body
is
medium
to
full
with
adequate
carbonation
to
liven
this
beer
the
drinkability
is
high
for
a
high
abv
sipper
the
beer
is
smooth
overall
this
is
a
great
beer
i
havent
tried
many
examples
of
this
style
but
ive
been
looking
for
a
reason
to
like
this
style
and
explore
it
more
good
job
for
helping
me
on
my
journey
boston
beer
d
very
drinkable
nice
rauchbier
with
some
good
smokey
flavor
and
enough
body
to
balance
out
the
flavors
it
pours
well
and
looks
great
the
aroma
is
extremely
inviting
the
mild
hop
leaves
for
an
interesting
aftertaste
but
the
nose
is
a
faint
spicy
smoke
the
taste
is
of
a
campfire
and
the
finish
is
a
complementary
heavy
earth
note
of
toffee
and
maybe
roasted
nuts
before
that
touch
of
hop
aftertaste
finally
kicks
in
this
is
clearly
the
best
out
of
the
bunch
of
limited
release
beers
this
year
that
ive
had
so
far
havent
had
the
vixen
or
third
voyage
yet
i
wish
it
had
more
smoke
more
on
a
schlenkerla
level
i
would
buy
this
year

it
were

great

i
really
have
no
complaints
on
this
one
really
well
done
and
very
enjoyable
cheers
fortunately
the
base
beer
is
good
after
the
smoking
the
rauch
adds
little
to
the
experience
overall
i
liked
this
much
more
than
i
thought
i
would
and
it
would
be
a
great
choice
for
the
cellar
d
this
was
a
very
nice
rauchbier
that
had
plenty
of
character
but
not
overthetop
smoke
the
scent
and
taste
were
nicely
balanced
and
the
body
was
excellent
the
alcohol
was
well
hidden
and
the
finish
was
smooth
so
it
was
very
easy
to
drink
perfect
beer
for
a
cookout
or
camping
recommended
taste
is
somewhere
in
between
a
sa
chocolate
bock
and
a
shiner
smokehaus
just
waaay
to
sweet
for
this
kind
of
style
hell
any
style
really
one
could
only
dream
it
would
be
like
a
schlenkerla
urbock
but
that
is
not
even
in
the
same
galaxy
not
to
mention
ballpark
i
have
been
moderately
impressed
with
whatever
this
series
of
22
oz
beers
bbc
has
been
putting
out
lately
tasman
griffins
bow
dark
depths
etc
but
this
one
is
the
bottom
of
the
dung
heap
for
me
too
sweet
overly
sweet
not
enough
smoke
and
did
i
mention
ridiculously
sweet
dont
think
i
can
finish
one
on
my
own
im
afraid
i
might
wake
up
with
type
i
diabetes
pours
a
dark
reddish
copper
color
with
a
hlaf
finger
head
which
recedes
to
edging
and
leaves
little
to
no
lace
the
aroma
is
of
caramel
malts
and
a
hint
of
smokiness
the
aroma
of
the
smokiness
gets
stronger
as
the
beer
warms
the
taste
starts
off
with
a
caramel
malt
taste
the
middle
has
the
taste
of
toffe
brown
sugar
and
dark
fruits
the
very
end
of
the
beer
is
smoke
again
the
smokiness
gets
stronger
as
the
beer
warms
the
mouthfeel
is
sticky
and
lowly
carbonated
overall
it
was
an
okay
beer
it
seemed
to
be
more
of
a
bock
than
a
rauchbier
the
smokiness
is
more
subdued
than
what
i
expected
o
highly
enjoyable
a
great
hybrid
rauchbierdouble
bock
note
dopplebockrauch
light
the
taste
was
surprisingly
more
of
the
same
i
wasnt
aware
it
was
going
to
be
a
smoky
beer
all
i
knew
is
it
would
be
a
bock
i
mean
it
had
a
goat
on
it
and
rauchbier
isnt
something
ive
heard
of
before
the
beer
is
very
sweet
very
malty
and
definitely
smoky
but
not
at
all
overly
so
it
smells
a
bit
like
it
might
be
peatsmoked
even
though
theres
no
indication
that
it
is
but
that
would
explain
that
garbage
smell
so
would
highly
fermented
malt
heaviness
though
i
suppose
this
beer
has
a
lot
of
doppelbock
qualities
it
doesnt
taste
like
what
the
description
of
rauchbier
describes
the
smokiness
is
not
too
upfront
and
well
balanced
with
sweet
maltiness
the
name
and
flavour
would
indicate
to
me
that
this
is
part
doppelbock
part
rauchbier
id
say
its
more
on
the
doppelbock
side
but
thats
just
me
damn
if
the
combination
isnt
delicious
as
hell
love
the
big
malty
sweetness
of
it
even
if
it
is
a
bit
sticky
almost
cloying
love
the
alcohol
burn
and
love
that
unique
flavour
added
by
the
rauch
smoke
i
would
highly
recommend
this
to
other
lovers
of
big
sweet
beers
too
much
smoke
imo
so
i
can
easily
say
it
was
not
balanced
at
least
for
me
thankfully
this
is
a
big
beer
so
it
can
take
a
few
lumps
good
to
sip
but
there
is
no
way
i
could
see
finishing
this
bottle
off
during
a
long
session
asking
you
to
try
it
would
be
a
dare
if
you
are
not
into
smoked
beers
even
if
you
are
it
might
be
a
challenge
appearance
is
a
warm
carmel
color
not
opaque
the
aroma
is
a
strong
bacon
odor
very
smoky
good
lacing
and
a
nice
settled
head
taste
is
a
sweet
smoke
flavor
with
a
hint
of
cinnamon
the
texture
is
a
little
syrupy
but
not
overbearing
would
pair
nicely
with
a
banana
creme
brulee
or
anything
with
bacon
i
liked
the
beer
but
it
is
a
little
too
smoky
for
my
tastes
22
oz
poured
into
pilsner
glass
appearance
is
a
dark
copper
with
a
decent
head
thatdinished
to
about
14
inch
good
lacing
the
smoke
stands
out
first
in
the
aroma
but
is
definitely
not
overwhelming
its
followed
by
toffee
and
maybe
some
kind
of
spice
tastes
very
pleasant
and
surprisingly
smooth
considering
the
abv
the
smoke
is
very
subtle
which
is
nice
and
the
beer
is
well
balanced
i
usually
dont
like
smoky
beers
this
much
because
theyre
always
too
smoky
but
this
beer
was
very
well
done
o
i
appreciated
the
subdued
smoke
which
didnt
overwhelm
a
topnotch
dbock
excellent
offering
at
a
reasonable
price
overall
a
tasty
bock
easy
to
drink
i
like
the
smokiness
no
alcohol
present
nice
overall
a
solid
brew
there
isnt
really
much
to
say
the
masking
of
the
high
alcohol
is
impressive
another
solid
sam
adams
beer
again
i
havent
had
too
many
rauchbiers
so
i
dont
know
what
to
look
for
but
i
found
this
brew
pretty
enjoyable
this
was
a
nice
gateway
beer
for
the
style
so
i
think
that
ill
need
to
add
more
on
to
my
beers
to
drink
list
d
from
the
22
fl
oz
bottle
batch
no
1
sampled
on
april
23
2012
it
was
served
at
about
4748
degrees
fahrenheit
it
pours
an
attractive
medium
to
dark
amber
with
ruby
red
highlights
flickering
in
the
light
along
with
a
long
lasting
foamy
beige
head
there
are
caramel
and
other
malts
on
the
nose
along
with
an
inviting
smokiness
light
yeast
and
a
touch
of
alcohol
the
body
is
medium
to
bold
the
taste
is
just
as
smoky
as
the
aroma
with
a
full
bitterness
wellintegrated
alcohol
and
and
a
near
dry
ending
a
likable
beer
o
first
off
i
love
rauchbiers
so
this
one
was
right
up
my
alley
the
flavor
was
awesome
the
body
was
spot
on
and
the
aroma
was
very
inviting
almost
equal
to
the
german
rauchbiers
highly
recommended
o
ive
had
better
rauchbiers
in
my
life
but
this
was
still
quite
good
the
sam
adams
taste
profile
worked
well
in
this
setting
doa
in
order
for
me
to
give
a
perfect
score
in
any
category
of
a
beer
i
have
to
be
wowed
and
in
awe
of
it
and
i
gotta
say
i
was
both
in
the
pour
of
this
beer
poured
a
rich
deep
bronze
with
a
perfectly
formed
cremay
one
finger
light
tan
head
that
has
held
thru
the
durationjust
perfect
color
and
definition
and
creaminess
in
the
head
the
aromas
dont
bring
so
much
promise
with
some
hardwood
smoke
and
mild
sweetness
that
creamy
head
translates
in
the
feel
with
a
creamy
coating
feelvery
nice
a
nice
mix
of
sweet
caramel
and
anise
flavors
and
more
subtle
upfront
smokethe
smoke
plays
a
larger
role
in
the
finish
hey
i
love
this
hybridthe
smoke
is
somewhat
assertive
as
is
the
doppelbock
toasty
sweetness
and
warming
notesi
loved
it
medium
body
with
lower
carbonation
alcohol
is
hidden
well
while
not
overly
smoky
the
base
dopplebock
here
is
really
good
well
made
boston
beer
company
did
a
credible
job
with
cinder
bock
my
hopes
were
honestly
not
all
that
high
its
a
pretty
decent
collision
of
a
rauchbier
and
a
doppelbock
the
smoke
and
malt
flavors
seem
to
fight
for
space
if
the
smoke
flavor
were
a
little
lighter
the
problem
would
be
solved
not
a
bad
beer
though
if
youre
into
smoky
beer
check
it
out
i
like
that
samuel
adams
is
experimenting
with
smoked
malts
and
i
hope
they
do
more
i
like
their
rauchbier
and
hope
maybe
theyll
do
a
smoked
porter
this
beer
is
very
well
made
adventurous
and
thoughtful
beer
i
would
prefer
more
smoke
malts
and
maybe
less
alcohol
but
an
enjoyable
taste
nonetheless
just
ok
for
me
i
didnt
dislike
it
so
dont
get
me
wrong
here
i
just
felt
like
it
could
have
been
a
lot
better
not
enough
smoke
for
my
tastes

sweet
and
almost
dessertlike
rauch
i
agree
that
this
one
has
very
little
that
reminds
me
of
a
bock
i
suppose
the
ubermaltiness
could
make
a
case
for
it
but
after
the
smokiness
has
had
its
way
those
qualities
have
morphed
into
something
completely
different
i
really
enjoyed
this
beer
and
would
have
it
again

gets
larger
as
it
warms
up
a
smooth
and
medium
to
lighter
bodied
mouthfeel
with
a
dry
fruitiness
in
the
aftertaste
more
fruit
presence
than
smoke
it
is
just
ok

im
a

this

bit
of
alcohol
popping
up
the
taste
is
actually
wellbalanced
the
smokiness
really
takes
the
sweet
edge
off
of
what
im
assuming
is
a
fairly
similar
recipe
to
their
imperial
series
double
bock
i
can
still
taste
the
sweetness
but
its
not
cloying
like
i
found
their
double
bock
the
mouthfeel
is
on
the
heavier
side
of
mediumbodied
and
the
drinkability
is
pretty
alright
overall
its
a
solid
smoked
beer
thats
a
good
break
from
the
smoked
porters
and
lagers
that
dominate
the
market
alcohol
ends
up
being
more
of
an
issue
in
the
feel
than
the
flavor
where
its
well
masked
not
quite
going
so
far
as
to
impart
astrincency
but
close
enough
to
detract
otherwise
thos
doppel
has
a
pretty
big
body
with
some
smoothness
to
it
and
depth
is
no
issue

medium

with

nicely
balanced
and
enjoyable
overall
a
pretty
nice
double
bock
with
smoked
flavor
enhancements
the
smoke
is
a
complimentary
flavor
instead
of
overpowering
everything
and
i
think
it
works
pretty
well
it
didnt
feel
as
strong
as
the
abv
overall
this
brew
does
a
good
job
of
mixing
the
rauchier
and
bock
styles
watch
out
for
the
9
45
abv
content
because
it
will
hit
you
at
the
end
of
the
glass
o
another
one
that
surprises
me
from
sam
adams
pretty
good
and
ill
be
looking
for
more
of
these
specialties
the
body
was
average
perhaps
a
bit
thin
for
my
tastes
for
a
bock
drinkability
will
depend
on
your
tolerance
for
the
smoke
if
you
like
it
youll
find
this
beer
very
drinkable
if
not
not
as
much
overall
a
good
solid
brew
thats
worth
a
shot
if
you
see
it
im
happy
to
see
a
large
brewery
like
bbc
stepping
out
and
making
some
of
these
lesser
known
styles
available
to
a
wider
audience
congrats
to
em
pours
a
rich
brownish

and
strong

caramel
toasted

smoked
malts
are
all
apparent
right
away
decent
bready
notes
that
give
it
that
bockish
style
there
is
a
mild
spicy
hop
and
spicy

still
remains
smokey

the

through
with
some

cured
meat
flavor
mouthfeel

a

well
carbonated
overall
a
good
strong
smoked
beer
it
will
kick
your
ass
though
feels
moderately
carbonated
warming
to
the
palate
overall
im
torn
because
this
is
a
unique
beer
or
at
least
ive
never
had
the
style
im
glad
i
tried
it
and
it
was
interesting
but
the
look
and
mouthfeel
were
disappointing
i
love
bbq
but
maybe
not
in
a
beer
i
guess

with
a

smokiness

slowly
fades
into
a
sweet
malty
taste
some
toffeecaramel
underneath
good
carbonation
tasty
smokiness
is
a
touch
strong
and
gets
to
be
a
bit
much
at
the
end
o
the
taste
was
very
disappointing
after
a
nice
aroma
the
beer
is
too
sweet
and
boozy
i
wish
the
bready
malts
and
smokiness
was
turned
up
quite
a
bit
and
the
sweetness
was
turned
down
a
lot
overall
i
quite
like
this
and
have
found
this
new
series
from
bbc
to
be
quite
impressive
smoky
flavors
up
front
with
a
hint
of
cooked
vegetables
sweet
malts
fill
in
and
take
over
midpalate
caramel
cookie
dough

rummy
fruits
mingle
charred
smoky
woody
flavors

lingering
smoke

full

syrupy
feel
slightly
warming
overal
a
very
tasty
mix
of
smoke
and
sweet
ok
like
the
combination
but
not
sure
it
works
very
well
this
is
one
that
i
would
have
to
wait
a
while
before
having
again
worth
a
try
carbonation
resides
on
the
low
side
and
it
has
a
body
somewhere
between
medium
and
full
its
almost
a
bit
sticky
overall
i
would
say
this
beer
is
quite
good
i
enjoyed
it
thoroughly
taste
begins
with
rich
malt
sweetness
tannins
and
some
smoke
in
the
middle
and
a
dry
alcoholic
close
mouthfeel
is
pretty
slickery
and
drinkability
is
okay
wanted
more
smoke
but
not
everyone
wants
schlenkerla
levels
like
me
anyways
o
one
of
samuel
adams
better
creations
well
made
and
eminently
drinkable
its
fair
game
to
say
that
doppebocks
are
among
the
earliest
examples
of
extreme
beers
if
so
then
this
sam
adams
example
makes
extreme
out
of
extreme
by
boosting
the
alchols
up
a
few
degrees
and
weaving
in
the
smoky
elements
of
traditional
rauchbiers
still
i
would
prefer
the
beer
to
demonstrate
a
drier
and
toastier
body
like
ayinger
celebrator
or
a
more
succulent
sherrylike
version
of
weihenstephaner
korbinian
because
the
molasses
sweetness
in
cinder
bock
gets
a
little
onedimensional
and
americanized
for
me
yet
another
wellmade
strong
beer
from
boston
beer
a
little
pricey
at
8
99
for
the
22
oz
bottle
overall
better
than
its
bonfire
predecessor
but
just
like
that
beer
this
one
does
have
a
purpose
besides
making
your
face
squirm
i
would
definitely
use
it
in
a
marinade
which
it
probably
would
excel
in
i
have
had
worse
beers
in
my
life
but
with
the
label
of
sam
adams
this
is
by
far
at
the
bottom
of
the
list
if
i
had
a
slogan
it
would
be
looks
good
taste
morbid
either
way
at
4
99
this
is
a
really
affordable
bomber
and
well
worth
the
money
spent
overall
a
pretty
solid
take
on
a
rauchbier
the
smoke
is
very
noticeable
but
not
overwhelming
and
blends
well
with
the
malts
mouthfeeloverall
medium
bodied
with
moderate
carbonation
pretty
nice
feel
and
it
does
drink
lighter
than
9
5
abv
very
flavorful
but
it
stays
reasonably
drinkable
pretty
good
rauschbier
admittedly
im
notl
experienced
with
this
style
but
this
beer
is
pretty
nice
and
not
over
the
top
in
smoke
flavor
which
i
appreciate
o
overall
a
nice
rauchbier
the
nose
is
a
little
one
dimensional
but
the
taste
is
really
nice
its
lightly
smokey
and
fruity
would
have
it
again
the
beer
pours
a
deep
red
color
with
a
tan
head
the
aroma
is
definitely
that
of
a
smoked
beer
i
get
a
ton
of
meaty
bbqlike
smoke
as
well
as
a
little
bit
of
roasted
malt
the
flavor
follows
suit
there
are
a
lot
of
burnt
malts
as
well
as
as
good
dose
of
smoke
and
a
little
bit
of
sweetness
from
the
toffee
or
caramel
malt
still
this
beer
is
all
about
the
smoke
and
it
definitely
delivers
on
that
front
i
dont
get
any
alcohol
which
is
surprising
since
the
beer
is
nearly
10
percent
medium
creamy
mouthfeel
and
medium
carbonation
overall
not
a
bad
tasting
brew
at
all
and
decently
interesting
to
sample
my
first
encounter
with
a
rauchbier
its
intriguing
but
the
alcohol
was
a
little
overpowering
and
the
metallicy
aftertaste
was
a
turnoff
the
abv
totally
killed
what
would
otherwise
be
a
nice
bock
noticable
alcohol
flavor
and
burn
just
not
needed
overall
a
nice
and
drinkable
beer
especially
at
this
abv
and
for
this
style
the
rauchbier
notes
are
not
overdone
at
all
but
they
could
be
a
bit
more
however
they
blend
nicely
with
the
bock
notes
nicely
done
and
good
for
the
price
not
sure
if
i
would
get
it
regularly
but
definitely
something
im
glad
i
tried
a
decent
if
not
strong
rauch
beer
the
smokiness
is
not
too
overpowering
to
still
get
a
decent
idea
of
this
beers
bock
backbone
however
im
finding
it
to
be
getting
a
bit
too
sweet
as
i
get
further
through
this
brew
this
is
a
very
dark
copperbrown
beer
with
a
small
head
that
fades
away
to
nothing
at
all
very
shortly
smokiness
comes
through
in
the
nose
sharply
phenolic
without
much
maltiness
the
taste
on
the
other
hand
is
very
heavily
malty
together
with
harsh
fusel
alcohol
notes
smoke
is
certainly
present
but
this
beer
lacks
the
superbly
tasty
smokiness
of
the
classic
schlenkerla
it
would
be
better
represented
in
a
less
strong
beer
i
think
its
nice
and
clear
in
the
glass
with
not
enough
head
maybe
the
next
warmer
glass
will
be
even
better
i
would
recommend
this
for
comparing
with
hellertrum
the
rauchbier
it
is
real
close
overall
i
like
the
beer
despite
my
problems
with
the
style
the
smoke
notes
here
are
still
too
strong
for
my
tastes
but
they
are
nicely
balanced
except
in
the
aftertaste
by
lovely
sugary
dark
fruit
esters
and
for
most
of
the
mouthful
neatly
complement
the
brew
so
well
made
is
the
beer
that
even
subsequent
mouthfuls
dont
lose
their
potency
or
nuance
assuring
a
smooth
drink
for
the
entire
bottle
worth
trying
oat
the
end
of
it
the
flavor
was
too
off
for
it
be
enjoyable
their
bonfine
rauch
was
better
than
this
o
judging
it
as
a
rauchbier
its
definitely
up
there
i
can
imagine
trying
to
get
the
right
balance
of
smoke
sweet
and
bitter
can
be
tricky
enjoyable
mediumbodied
maybe
a
little
on
the
sweet
side
i
liked
it
o
this
has
good
drinkability
it
has
nice
flavor
and
i
could
easily
have
a
few
pints
of
this
overall
i
think
this
is
a
solid
beer
and
a
nice
example
of
the
style
the
booze
is
well
hidden
for
being
as
high
as
it
is
i
just
think
this
is
a
nice
and
interesting
beer
i
recommend
trying
it
out
i
would
buy
it
again
i
was
a
little
wary
on
this
one
because
i
dont
get
into
rauchbiers
too
much
but
this
was
definitely
a
balanced
and
deliciously
pleasant
surprise
pick
it
up
if
youre
looking
for
a
unique
and
tasty
beer
a
very
interesting
rauchbier
creation
i
didnt
find
the
smokiness
particularly
noticeable
in
the
taste
like
some
of
bambergs
best
rauchbier
offerings
but
the
complex
taste
and
exceptionally
smooth
mouthfeel
makes
this
beer
stand
out
to
me
no
this
isnt
a
schlenkerla
but
this
is
its
own
unique
take
on
the
rauchbier
style
overall
this
may
be
my
favorite
sam
adams
brew
this
beer
is
a
combination
of
two
styles
that
really
do
not
combine
within
the
brew
but
take
separate
turns
at
being
excellent
the
rauchbier
aspect
is
dead
onsimilar
to
aecht
scherlenkerlas
urbockand
the
dopplebock
that
follows
almost
has
more
of
a
sweetness
that
i
associate
with
an
english
barleywine
the
alcohol
is
scarily
barely
noticeable
this
one
is
right
up
there
with
the
best
i
have
had
this
year
i
would
not
take
this
over
scherlenkerlas
urbock
or
marzen
but
for
a
cheaper
us
treat
i
would
stock
this
on
a
regular
basis
d
im
a
sucker
for
smoke
and
this
brew
does
not
disappoint
smokeysweet
flavors
makes
for
one
of
the
biggest
rauchbiers
i
have
ever
had
not
bad
but
uninteresting
overall
not
much
complexity
and
a
bland
smokiness
rauchbiers
are
not
known
to
be
easy
drinking
but
a
bomber
of
this
solo
is
a
haul
i
approve
i
enjoy
this
rauchbier
you
might
too
its
not
an
authentic
german
example
but
it
comes
really
damn
close
and
ups
the
abv
in
the
process
prost
overall
i
like
these
new
additions
to
sam
adams
they
are
kind
of
fun
and
different
from
the
normal
offerings
this
one
is
another
nice
addition
to
the
group
o
a
good
choice
not
a
heavy
beer
but
with
some
kick
abvwise
smooth
drinking
and
enjoyable
this
is
one
i
will
be
again
and
put
some
away
for
later
on
beer
is
a
bit
thick
with
very
little
carbonation
overall
this
is
an
enjoyable
beer
i
dont
think
id
choose
it
as
an
example
of
a
bock
but
regardless
of
its
strict
adherence
to
a
particular
style
its
still
an
enjoyable
beer
for
its
perhaps
offbeat
whim
of
smoke

definitely

before
i
wish
it
had
overall
im
pleasantly
surprised
interesting
experiment
well
executed
and
more
importantly
a
tasty
brew
i
would
recommend
splitting
the
bottle
with
a
buddy
though
as
the
flavors
are
pretty
massive
and
intense
and
can
wear
ya
out

an
interesting
and
great
tasting

i
will
be

a

i
am
familiar

smoked

taste
is
just
as
aggressive
unfortunately
i
cant
get
anything
else
out
of
it

of
those
styles
that
amazes
me
it

a
decent

o
this
is
far
from
my
favorite
samuel
adams
offering
perhaps
if
the
presence
of
smoked
malt
were
a
little
more
noticeable
this
beer
would
be
a
winner
but
as
is
its
a
bit
rough
maybe
i
just
dont
like
the
way
samuel
adams
handles
bocks
but
this
is
not
what
i
typically
look
for
in
the
style
verdict
o
another
solid
hybridstyle
beer
from
sa
you
definitely
get
both
bock
and
rauch
characters
and
they
combine
to
make
a
surprisingly
good
overall
beer
tried
a
little
bit
of
a
sample
at
the
ebf
the
beer
poured
out
looking
really
nice
it
has
a
red
color
with
some
shaded
of
brown
in
it
the
smell
of
the
beer
is
super
smokey
the
taste
of
the
beer
is
too
smokey
i
think
i
wasnt
digging
this
ones
flavor
too
much
the
mouthfeel
was
surprisingly
heavy
i
thought
overall
this
beer
was
didnt
go
over
too
well
with
me
mainly
because
of
the
flavor
i
prefer
the
bonfire
rauch
that
came
in
the
autumn
variety
pack
more
poured
from
a
bottle
into
a
stemmed
pilsner
the
beer
is
a
bright
crisp
slightly
hazed
chestnutauburn
coloring
with
a
thin
small
bubbled
offwhite
head
that
rests
a
very
low
eighth
of
an
inch
aromas
of
campfire
charcoal
and
darkly
sweet
caramel
flood
the
nose
the
beer
carries
the
smoked
qualities
directly
into
the
taste
with
a
meaty
and
charcoal
burst
of
flavors
on
the
forward
tongue
followed
by
more
subtle
and
sweet
characteristics
including
carmel
and
toffee
very
smooth
and
almost
creamy
in
mouth
the
brew
has
a
subtle
aftertaste
of
toffee
and
cream
with
just
a
hint
of
smoke
the
finish
is
quick
for
the
most
part
with
a
bit
of
the
smokey
residue
remaining
on
the
roof
of
the
mouth
and
the
back
of
the
tongue
good
venture
into
the
world
of
rauchbier
for
bbc
not
a
bad
beer
at
all
a
really
really
good
rauchbier
drank
out
of
a
1l
mab
but
only
poured
a
half
liter
the
nose
is
also
overwhelming
though
the
scent
itself
is
mild
hickory
hickory
hickory
large
amounts
of
lace
after
a
moderate
head
of
off
white
gobs
attractive
beer
big
white
bubbles
hang
around
after
the
head
thins
out
smoked
flavor
is
subdued
and
mellowed
out
with
a
maltiness
reminscent
of
a
watered
down
old
chub
malt
profile
carbonation
is
light
to
moderate
but
with
the
smokiness
and
malt
background
its
fitting
i
dont
think
my
5l
will
last
until
tomorrow
no
work
no
worries
overall
solid
and
paired
up
well
with
some
sausages
and
sauerkraut
check
it
out
if
there
but
wouldnt
be
the
first
on
my
list
in
their
lineup
this
was
a
very
interesting
beer
but
i
confess
to
struggling
a
bit
in
drinking
it
and
it
is
not
a
style
that
i
would
particularly
go
for
sweet
cherry
wood
bacon
almost
gamey
and
milk
chocolate
on
the
nose
a
very
promising
start
the
palate
has
a
fair
bit
of
fizz
and
unfortunately
this
keeps
the
flvaours
under
wraps
certainly
underfruited
when
compared
to
the
nose
and
only
a
touch
of
milk
chocolate
pokes
out
the
germans
are
a
much
better
option
even
if
they
cost
more
the
bottle
says
this
is
a
smoked
dark
ale
rather
than
a
lager
as
is
usually
the
case
with
a
traditional
rauchbier
either
way
it
is
an
easy
drinking
if
ultimately
unmemorable
smoked
beer
all
and
all
this
beer
is
an
exact
example
of
schlenkerla
made
for
the
mass
australian
market
it
could
be
improved
craft
beer
wise
by
adding
more
captivating
malts
pretty
good
attempt
at
the
style
d
light
on
smoke
for
the
style
but
the
chocolate
notes
made
up
for
it
not
bad
overall
im
not
convinced
there
is
a
better
rauchbier
brewed
in
australia
this
makes
a
very
decent
stab
at
the
style
it
really
lacks
fullness
and
sweetness
on
the
palate
but
otherwise
very
decent
d
this
isnt
too
bad
for
the
style
it
has
a
reasonable
amount
of
flavour
and
isnt
overbearingly
smoky
i
cant
see
myself
drinking
lots
and
lots
of
this
but
i
cant
see
myself
sessioning
any
rauchbier
that
is
not
to
say
it
isnt
a
well
made
beer
though
just
not
to
my
taste
an
interesting
beer
a
unique
mix
of
flavours
that
whilst
being
enjoyable
and
somewhat
compelling
doesnt
actually
add
to
the
drinkability
of
the
beer
and
by
the
looks
of
the
other
reviews
it
seems
they
may
have
finally
sorted
out
some
of
the
earlier
problems
give
it
a
go
brown
to
black
in
colour
almost
completely
flat
strange
aroma
maybe
slightly
infected
or
oxidised
more
or
less
no
smoke
aroma
and
very
little
flavour
at
all
had
to
pour
it
out
d
apart
from
the
smell
which
i
suspect
may
be
from
too
high
a
fermentation
temp
this
is
a
decent
enough
beer
interesting
yet
not
too
full
on
like
some
other
rauchbiers
can
be
somewhat
sweet
but
really
good
smoke
flavour
tons
of
toasty
bacony
goodness
looks
good
too
b
slightly
below
the
schlenkerla
helles
overall
it
has
some
pleasant
characters
but
its
a
pretty
weak
example
of
a
rauch
as
much
as
the
initial
characters
are
promising
it
just
falls
flat
and
ends
up
pretty
bland
1276
d
i
honestly
expected
a
lot
more
smokiness
as
it
warmed
the
smoke
came
through
a
bit
more
very
enjoyable
and
to
style
nonetheless
this
is
a
nicelooking
brew
a
beautiful
clear
coppergold
color
with
a
white
head
and
great
lace
the
smell
has
a
very
light
smoke
nose
the
smoke
is
not
quite
as
intense
as
i
expected
think
of
it
not
as
standing
near
a
fire
but
smelling
the
smoke
on
something
that
had
recently
been
near
the
fire
there
is
a
little
lightly
toasted
malt
underneath
the
smoke
not
bad
the
taste
is
fairly
dry
with
a
sharpness
and
starkly
character
a
little
on
the
acidic
side
not
much
in
the
way
of
hop
notes
the
smoke
is
still
present
in
the
taste
but
far
quieter
than
it
is
in
the
smell
the
mouthfeel
is
very
light
and
somewhat
bright
decently
drinkable
nothing
special
this
is
my
first
rauchbier
and
while
i
found
the
smoke
interesting
there
just
wasnt
enough
after
reading
some
reviews
of
others
beers
in
the
style
i
think
i
chose
poorly
ill
have
to
revisit
this
style
again
and
make
a
more
thoughtful
selection
overall
it
is
a
refreshing
brew
the
taste
was
a
little
too
delicate
for
me
i
was
pleased
at
first
but
by
the
end
it
started
tasting
like
water
nontheless
its
a
beer
i
would
choose
when
introducing
someone
to
craft
brew
had
this
around
the
same
time
as
the
spezial
rauch
lager
both
were
very
similar
pours
clear
gold
with
a
short
white
head
smoky
sweet
nose
sweet
taste
kind
of
a
pilsener
with
a
smoky
finish
fair
mix
of
malt
and
hops
okay
but
if
you
are
claiming
to
be
a
smoked
beer
be
more
smokey
not
as
intense
in
smoke
flavor
as
i
was
expecting
but
nonetheless
could
make
a
nice
training
wheels
rauch
for
those
looking
to
jump
into
the
style
one
of
the
more
drinkable
rauchbiers
available
tasty
and
smoky
without
wiping
out
your
sense
of
taste
overall
pretty
drinkable
a
decent
version
of
the
style
i
just
wish
the
smokey
aspect
of
this
brew
was
more
pronounced
still
i
wouldnt
turn
one
down
if
offered
the
harmony
of
flavors
is
very
good
i
just
wish
that
those
flavors
had
a
bit
more
intensity
but
the
mouthfeel
is
elegant
and
the
smoke
enhances
the
malty
flavors
without
overwhelming
them
there
are
more
flavorful
examples
of
the
rauchbier
style
available
but
this
one
is
graceful
nicely
balanced
and
well
made
light
meatysmoked
aroma
tall
frothy
dirty
white
head
fades
briskly
as
bits
of
lace
are
pulled
down
with
it
deep
golden
beer
holds
a
few
streams
of
carbonation
a
mild
malty
sweetness
forms
the
base
and
it
holds
until
late
in
the
game
toward
the
finish
there
is
a
bit
of
campfire
mixed
with
spicy
hop
bite
mild
carbonation
mixed
with
a
moderately
full
body
make
for
a
beer
that
goes
down
easy
a
mild
and
balanced
smoked
beer
you
dont
see
many

this
beer
poured

than
expected
the
color
of
the
beer
was
a
hazy
yellow
color
with
a
really
nice
white
domed
head
on
top
the
lacing
left
behind
was
scattered
but
still
very
nice
the
smell
of
the
beer
was
indeed
smokey
but
had
some
faint
malt
aromas
in
there
too
the
smell
was
mostly
a
salty
smoke
flavor
not
overwhelming
the
mouthfeel
was
nice
overall
it
fits
the
style
pretty
well
o
admittedly
my
first
encounter
with
the
style
and
i
wasnt
really
sure
what
to
expect
that
being
said
this
beer
is
incredibly
drinkable
and
while
the
flavor
was
very
awkward
at
the
start
i
found
myself
getting
used
to
and
enjoying
it
more
and
more
as
time
went
on
a
great
introduction
to
the
rauchbier
style
worth
picking
up
o
im
normally
not
one
for
smoked
beers
but
this
wasnt
too
terrible
probably
couldnt
drink
too
much
but
good
to
try
at
least
dvery
easy
drink
here
and
probably
one
of
the
most
subtle
and
inviting
smoke
presences
of
any
rauchbier
i
have
had
the
juicy
hop
presence
balances
it
very
well
and
adds
a
nice
refreshing
dimension
this
is
for
the
bottle
entry
i
think
this
should
be
merged
with
bamberg
style
rauchbier
as
its
the
same
bottle
pours
a
very
clear
medium
goldorange
with
a
large
white
head
nose
is
what
i
would
describe
as
a
vienna
malt
with
some
yeasty
influence
and
a
beautiful
salty
smoked
ham
mouth
is
at
first
just
a
touch
of
yeast
and
light
grains
and
this
really
lovely
smokey
quality
ive
had
smoked
beers
before
and
havent
enjoyed
one
nearly
this
much
light
bitterness
at
the
tail
end
the
smoke
expresses
itself
in
bacon
or
cured
ham
its
fairly
light
but
marries
perfectly
i
feel
like
i
could
down
a
750ml
of
this
quickly
and
easily

abv
wow
this
is
a
benchmark
for
this
style
absolutely
no
off
flavors
just
so
interesting
and
pleasant
drinkability
this
is
a
beer
worthy
of
driving
long
distances
for
i
love
this
style
and
it
may
be
my
favorite
american
version
of
the
style
the
smoke
balances
with
the
caramel
malt
perfectly
true
to
the
german
style
with
an
american
kick
go
get
this
one
arrived
with
a
fingers
worth
of
offtan
head
with
decent
retention
color
was
a
slightly
hazy
golden
honeyyellow
nose
had
a
perfect
light
smokiness
that
would
make
it
perfect
for
the
beginner
yet
palatable
for
the
initiated
mouthfeel
was
medium
with
a
mildly
smoky
slightly
tart
taste
on
the
tongue
finish
was
just
smoky
enough
to
make
the
german
in
me
smile
i
love
this
kind
of
thing
from
our
american
craft
brewers
this
is
a
world
class
rauchbier
and
probably
the
most
drinkable
example
ive
tasted
well
crafted
d
more
please
the
ale
lacks
an
alcohol
presence
but
it
cracks
a
solid
flavor
a
nice
take
on
the
style
this
is
my
first
foray
into
this
style
while
the
beer
wasnt
bad
i
didnt
particularly
enjoy
it
that
much
given
that
ive
had
lots
of
other
iron
hill
beers
and
enjoyed
them
tremendously
i
have
come
to
the
conclusion
that
rather
than
this
being
a
poor
representation
of
the
style
i
must
just
not
enjoy
this
style
of
beer
personally
nicely
done
rauchbier
here
with
just
the
right
amount
of
smokey
quality
that
keeps
you
interested
but
also
doesnt
detract
from
the
drinkibility
i
unfortunately
skipped
this
when
it
was
on
draft
last
month
but
i
wont
make
the
same
mistake
next
time
i
see
it
d
im
not
very
well
acquainted
with
smoked
beers
but
this
one
just
felt
right
mouthfeel
is
great
with
a
nice
flavor
spread
throughout
the
entire
mouth
drinkability
is
better
than
most
rauchbiers
i
could
actually
do
a
growler
of
this
stuff
if
you
like
smoke
type
beers
this
one
is
for
you
this
is
quite
quaffable
though
it
does
drink
quite
a
bit
bigger
than
the
3
8
alcohol
would
suggest
in
another
beer
the
crazy
underattenuation
might
get
to
me
but
i
really
like
the
fullness
that
this
beer
has
it
really
seems
to
work
in
this
smoky
brew
on
the
other
hand
at
this
alcohol
level
a
750ml
bottle
is
quite
easy
to
knock
back
wow
i
just
sneezed
quite
vigorously
and
it
really
opens
up
a
new
level
to
the
smoke
aromatics
in
this
brew
rich
smoked
aromas
seemed
to
be
pasted
to
my
scent
receptors
for
a
minute
or
so
after
sneezing
i
highly
recommend
it
if
you
get
the
chance
over
all
its
not
a
bad
attempt
at
a
rauch
the
flavor
was
a
bit
of
a
let
down
but
combined
with
the
smell
it
kept
a
lot
of
its
drinkability

malty
sweet

crystal
clear
deep
amber
the
smokey
flavor
lives
up
to
its
namesake
but
is
not
a
nice
balance
in
this
beer
the
malt
flavor
and
body
are
too
light
it
would
be
a
much
better
fit
in
a
porter
with
deep
roasted
malts
overall
this
is
a
brilliant
beer
i
want
one
in
the
summer
and
spring
when
im
grillingwhy
dont
i
have
some
brats
with
me
right
now
pours
up
to
a
moderate
foam
head
and
leaves
bits
of
foam
down
the
glass
hazy
amber
color
aroma
is
roasted
nuts
biscuit
and
munich
malts
flavor
is
more
of
the
same
although
intensitywise
this
is
reportedly
weak
for
the
style
mouthfeel
is
light
and
refreshing
which
is
also
on
the
low
end
of
style
overall
i
give
the
beer
a
4
5
because
here
is
where
i
can
say
screw
the
style
guidelines
i
really
like
this
beer
theres
a
soft
smokiness
watery
roastiness
and
touches
of
malt
and
nut
the
taste
is
not
rich
enough
not
robust
enough
for
the
style
its
still
good
and
tasty
but
seems
to
miss
the
mark
o
if
i
had
to
introduce
someone
to
a
rauchbier
i
think
this
beer
would
be
a
good
choice
because
the
smoky
flavors
are
subtler
and
its
lighter
in
body
compared
to
the
standard
german
beers
in
this
style
needless
to
say
it
goes
down
very
easily
pours
dark
amber
reddish
tinted
with
a
thick
14
inch
fluffy
white
foam
smoky
nose
mixed
in
malt
taste
is
thin
caramel
with
a
fierysmoky
close
little
bit
of
bitter
hangs
out
at
the
finish
slightly
sour
smoke
is
a
little
off
putting
at
the
end
served
from
the
bottle
into
a
standard
shaker
at
the
pantry
on
32213
pours
a
dark
burnished
orange
like
a
worn
sunbleached
oak
barrel
there
is
a
little
cream
colored
head
that
dissipates
quickly
without
much
lacing
left
behind
the
nose
is
off
it
smells
like
a
standard
amber
ale
with
hints
of
melted
sugar
and
baked
brown
bread
but
there
is
the
smoke
smell
as
well
they
just
dont
work
well
together
on
the
nose
and
it
reminds
me
more
of
just
pure
liquid
smoke
which
is
just
a
touch
offputting
the
taste
is
not
very
smoky
though
there
is
definitely
a
biscuit
taste
and
some
sweet
caramel
with
just
a
touch
of
that
artificial
smoke
flavor
mouthfeel
is
medium
overall
this
is
just
not
working
for
me
maybe
the
smoked
flavor
is
more
of
a
porter
thing
for
me
and
i
need
to
keep
trying
things
but
i
just
didnt
like
it
rjt
serving
type
bottle
its
very
pretty
in
the
glass
the
aroma
is
not
that
of
a
rauchbier
so
a
huge
ding
but
the
taste
is
great
and
the
mouthfeel
is
too
another
great
colorado
beer
i
thought
this
was
a
nice
more
mild
version
of
the
style
the
smokiness
isnt
so
dominant
that
you
dont
have
a
difficult
time
tasting
what
else
is
here
overall
i
thought
this
was
a
decent
beer
not
true
to
style
enough
to
be
called
a
rauchbier
but
for
an
amber
ale
i
would
say
it
was
a
little
above
average
this
beer
was
pretty
drinkable
it
was
really
smooth
and
the
flavor
did
an
ok
job
at
holding
my
attention
i
could
drink
two
of
these
but
i
think
that
would
be
my
limit
what
i
liked
most
about
this
beer
was
the
flavor
and
aroma
they
were
the
highlights
of
this
beer
and
were
both
pretty
balanced
what
i
liked
least
about
this
beer
was
the
lightness
of
the
smoke
and
the
higher
carbonation
i
needed
more
smoke
and
less
carbonation
i
would
be
buy
this
beer
again
when
looking
for
a
lightly
smokey
beer
but
i
wouldnt
buy
it
often
i
recommend
giving
this
beer
a
try
it
might
make
for
a
good
gateway
rauchbier
all
in
all
this
was
a
lightly
smokey
amber
what
it
lacked
in
intensity
it
made
up
for
in
drinkability
this
was
the
second
beer
i
have
had
from
this
brewery
and
it
was
better
then
their
chocolate
stout
i
thought
it
was
a
pretty
solid
beer
and
i
wouldnt
mind
trying
some
more
beers
from
this
brewery
overall
an
ok
rauchbier
but
far
from
the
top
in
the
style
i
would
drink
it
again
though
purely
for
the
ease
of
accessibility
and
lack
of
rauchbiers
on
the
market
o
pretty
good
beer
but
there
are
much
better
examples
of
the
style
that
are
easy
enough
to
come
by
wouldnt
turn
it
down
if
someone
offered
me
one
though
o
this
is
the
first
rauchbeir
i
have
ever
had
but
it
was
a
style
i
longed
to
try
since
i
like
other
smokey
things
so
i
cant
tell
you
if
its
a
good
example
of
its
style
however
its
well
balanced
and
come
on
it
tastes
a
little
like
bacon
who
wouldnt
like
that
i
was
always
told
rauchbeirs
were
overbearing
so
i
dont
know
if
they
toned
down
the
smoke
or
if
its
simply
that
i
like
smokey
things
i
went
into
this
thinking
it
was
going
to
be
meh
but
i
was
pleasantly
surprised
sure
its
not
a
very
in
your
face
rauchbier
but
its
a
well
put
together
beer
and
tasty
despite
being
on
the
mild
side
for
the
style
a
fine
beer
that
could
be
sessionable
however
it
lacks
inspiration
id
buy
it
again
this
is
a
really
nice
easy
to
drink
everyday
amber
lager
i
certainly
would
not
call
it
a
rauchbier
by
any
stretch
of
the
imagination
but
i
would
buy
it
again
seeing
as
how
its
a
nice
blend
between
two
of
my
favorite
beers
eliot
ness
and
fat
tire
this
is
a
nice
addition
to
our
distribution
one
of
the
better
fort
collins
brews
has
a
fantastic
nose
of
smoked
malt
and
dried
pitted
fruit
described
as
a
lager
there
is
nothing
lager
about
what
i
taste
here
smokey
like
a
grill
fire
slightly
sweet
like
caramelized
malts
and
quite
refreshing
despite
its
heavy
flavors
this
beer
is
in
excellent
balance
and
the
mouthfeel
is
just
right
fuller
bodied
for
a
lager
and
well
carbonated
i
could
easily
down
a
sixpack
of
these
in
a
session
any
time
of
year
not
as
smokey
as
some
of
the
traditional
rauchbiers
but
in
that
vein
this
is
great
very
interesting
smoked
beer
i
like
the
flavors
but
the
lingering
sweetness
gets
a
little
sickly
after
a
couple
glasses
still
this
is
easily
the
best
beer
ive
had
from
this
brewery
so
far
i
cant
tell
what
to
think
about
this
beer
is
it
an
ale
is
it
a
lager
do
i
even
like
it
im
not
really
sure
but
its
definitely
worth
a
try
i
might
not
buy
it
for
myself
but
i
wouldnt
turn
it
away
if
someone
offered
it
to
me
o
glad
i
got
to
try
it
there
are
no
off
flavors
and
i
did
enjoy
it
but
its
not
something
id
seek
out
i
may
be
in
the
minority
here
but
i
wish
a
lot
of
the
rauchbiers
ive
tried
featured
the
smoke
more
as
a
main
character
rather
than
an
extra
maybe
all
the
smoked
texas
barbecue
i
grew
up
with
has
desensitized
me
this
is
very
drinkable
and
would
make
a
nice
cold
weather
beer
overall
though
the
flavor
is
mild
and
not
very
complex
pours
a
nice
dark
tinted
ambercopper
colored
ale
with
an
offwhite
foamy
head
that
stays
pretty
well
throughout
the
session
funky
aroma
i
am
getting
smacked
in
the
nostrils
with
some
smoked
meat
which
is
making
me
hungry
meaty
and
campfire
smoke
abounds
there
are
some
green
olives
and
malt
in
there
too
i
think
its
great
more
smokiness
on
the
taste
and
there
is
still
some
meat
along
with
slight
coffee
and
roastiness
slight
bandaid
aftertaste
which
is
a
little
puttingoff
overall
i
enjoyed
my
experience
with
this
beer
i
wouldnt
say
it
is
one
of
the
greatest
but
it
has
a
lot
going
on
and
i
enjoyed
the
session
medium
bodied
with
a
prominent
spice
character
up
front
that
takes
away
from
what
little
smokiness
is
underneath
hints
of
cinnamon
and
brown
sugar
along
with
faint
bitter
hops
that
are
slowly
countered
by
a
sweet
malt
backbone
very
faint
smokiness
but
it
is
completely
overpowered
by
the
other
characteristics
lots
of
sweet
caramel
along
with
some
biscuit
and
toffee
as
it
warms
the
smokey
elements
become
more
evident
but
are
still
considerably
weak
overall
a
very
solid
smoked
lager
this
is
well
worth
trying
if
you
are
a
smoked
beer
fan
overall
balanced
well
but
too
subtle
on
the
smoke
easy
enough
to
drink
a
very
nice
smoked
lager
thats
about
as
formitable
as
negra
modelo
except
with
a
balance
of
smoke
aroma
and
flavor
thats
careful
not
to
dominate
the
brew
very
dark
amber
in
appearance
no
cloudiness
at
all
single
finger
creamcolored
sticky
head
nice
lacing
a
bit
too
thin
in
body
smells
of
mild
baconey
smoke
with
a
medium
strong
malt
underneath
and
tastes
exactly
the
same
as
the
nose
only
with
a
heavy
emphasis
on
the
sweet
malt
did
i
mention
that
the
smoke
is
really
mild
for
a
rauchbier
this
seems
like
its
meant
to
be
an
intro
to
the
style
for
those
unfamiliar
with
it
nice
and
mild
but
not
what
i
want
when
i
seek
out
a
rauchbier
overall
it
tasted
really
good
i
would
drink
this
again
for
sure
pours
a
clear
dark
copper
orange
with
a
1
inch
offwhite
head
that
settles
to
a
thin
film
small
dots
and
streaks
of
lace
form
on
the
glass
on
the
drink
down
smell
is
of
roasted
malt
and
some
smokecampfire
aromas
taste
is
of
roasted
malt
smoke
flavors
and
a
coffee
grounds
aftertaste
mild
bitterness
on
the
palate
after
each
sip
good
carbonation
with
a
crisp
and
clean
mouthfeel
overall
this
is
a
pretty
good
american
take
on
a
rauchbier
style
that
is
much
more
mild
than
any
of
the
others
i
have
tried
so
far
o
quite
bland
and
meh
dr
very
drinkable
for
a
rauchbier
but
then
it
really
isnt
one
its
quite
affordable
in
any
case
and
while
it
wont
please
hardcore
fans
of
the
style
it
would
make
an
excellent
introduction
to
the
style
for
newcomers
before
plunging
them
into
schenkerla
its
certainly
worth
a
spin
and
i
admire
the
brewerys
boldness
in
trying
to
capture
an
american
mainstream
market
with
this
overall
very
good
smoked
lager
highly
recommended
if
you
like
smoked
beers
o
this
is
a
nice
beer
but
its
nowhere
near
as
intense
as
schlenkerla
more
like
spezial
if
were
going
german
calderas
is
better
domestically
but
frankly
hardly
any
brewers
make
this
style
so
its
always
nice
to
see
a
cheers
this
lager
pours
brilliantly
clear
deep
red
with
garnet
hues
and
a
sticky
offwhite
head
the
aroma
is
moderatehigh
peaty
smoky
malt
a
bit
biscuity
spicy
and
sweet
very
inviting
the
flavor
is
moderately
malty
earthy
a
bit
spicy
maybe
from
hops
and
malt
a
sweet
caramel
flavor
comes
through
at
the
swallow
the
beer
finishes
quite
smooth
and
rather
balanced
the
carbonation
and
body
are
both
moderate
overall
a
well
crafted
tasty
brewworth
a
try
one
wish
would
be
the
flavor
to
come
through
a
bit
more
intensely
like
the
nose
o
a
nice
smoked
beer
for
those
who
dont
really
want
to
drink
liquid
bacon
its
not
too
heavy
like
many
rauchbiers
and
isnt
overwhelmingly
smoky
o
this
is
a
tasty
smoke
beer
but
it
lacks
complexity
and
does
not
stick
out
in
any
way
a
decent
beer
and
a
good
introduction
to
the
smoked
variety
but
as
a
rauchbier
lover
i
really
hoped
for
a
more
intense
experience
a
medium
copper
color
with
light
carbonation
and
little
foam
the
aroma
has
a
mild
smokiness
reminiscent
hickory
chips
in
a
fire
pit
the
taste
has
a
nice
maltiness
but
i
was
expecting
a
little
denser
body
which
seems
a
tad
watered
down
probably
from
being
produced
on
the
level
it
is
it
has
promise
up
front
with
the
aroma
but
is
weak
on
the
followthrough
a
unique
brew
but
really
not
what
im
looking
for
in
an
enjoyable
beer
smokey
qualities
are
adequately
demonstrated
but
without
much
of
a
hop
presence
to
balance
the
malty
sweetness
it
begins
to
get
flat
and
unpleasant
fcb
could
deliver
this
one
a
bit
better
d
a
great
brew
and
an
excellent
choice
for
someone
looking
to
get
into
smoke
brews
zs
smoke
is
subtle
but
easily
perceived
so
that
it
will
give
the
drinker
a
good
idea
of
what
smoke
is
all
about
without
overwhelming
them
allinall
this
is
a
very
well
balanced
brew
that
deserves
some
attention
the
verdict
i
personally
did
enjoy
this
beer
at
all
i
was
very
disappointed
with
it
after
getting
excited
to
see
it
in
my
local
store
it
tasted
very
similar
to
three
skulls
buccaner
bacon
which
was
also
not
very
good
let
me
preface
this
review
by
saying
i
didnt
think
the
beer
was
bad
and
i
enjoyed
it
but
when
i
was
told
by
the
bartender
it
was
a
rauchbier
and
then
tried
it
i
felt
let
down
poured
a
reddish
copper
with
minimal
head
that
stuck
around
and
died
slow
and
left
lace
ring
had
a
bittery
watery
smell
for
some
reason
and
some
sweet
malts
but
not
the
smokey
smell
i
expected
taste
follows
the
same
as
instead
of
a
smokey
bullish
malt
beer
i
get
a
rather
lightly
sweetened
bitter
pale
ale
it
seems
as
a
lighttomedium
body
passes
over
my
tongue
w
sharp
hoppy
bitterness
and
hints
of
roasted
malts
mixed
w
minor
sweet
caramel
it
finishes
dry
and
was
alright
to
drink
but
they
missed
the
ball
on
this
one
d
i
am
no
a
fan
i
am
appreciate
a
good
smoked
beer
but
i
am
not
sure
what
this
wants
to
be
odd
that
this
comes
from
fort
collins
which
brews
such
great
beers
their
rocky
mountain
ipa
is
one
of
my
favorites
and
is
an
undiscovered
gem
d
this
beer
is
undrinkable
with
a
great
nose
and
a
nice
malt
flavor
buried
under
the
awful
peat
smokechlorine
phenol
quality
i
love
rauchbiers
and
this
is
not
one
it
is
to
harsh
to
drink
drinkability
is
bad
i
cant
finish
this
beer
i
finish
every
beer
i
start
i
normally
love
fort
collins
but
i
would
not
recommend
this
beer
to
anyone
its
an
odd
beer
definitely
one
for
a
campfire
side
you
could
basically
suck
of
a
charred
piece
of
wood
and
get
the
same
effect
d
tasty
but
forgetful
a
good
change
up
but
not
interesting
enough
to
be
a
regular
purchase
want
more
smoke
drinkability
pretty
goodno
heatno
over
abrassive
elements
at
all
smoke
isnt
too
big
to
make
it
a
repeat
drink
this
beer
pours
a
deep
amber
color
with
a
head
of
offwhite
foam
that
reduces
to
a
film
on
the
surface
the
aroma
of
this
beer
is
mostly
of
caramel
but
if
you
dig
real
deep
you
can
pull
out
the
smoke
aroma
that
is
supposed
to
be
there
there
are
also
hints
of
ginger
and
cinnamon
the
taste
is
much
lighter
than
i
would
have
expected
there
is
an
initial
bitterness
that
is
immediately
followed
by
a
sweet
caramel
flavor
the
aftertaste
is
where
the
smoke
comes
in
and
its
rather
obvious
on
the
aftertaste
palate
honestly
its
not
nearly
as
strong
as
i
was
thinking
that
it
would
be
on
the
overall
palate
the
palate
is
odd
to
me
everything
seems
to
be
there
but
still
it
seems
thin
in
the
body
this
is
a
drinkable
beer
nothing
overall
wrong
with
it
but
its
a
stoically
unimpressive
good
beer
not
great
d
drinkable
yes
as
theres
nothing
particularly
aversive
but
there
are
better
smoked
beers
out
there
wont
be
seeking
this
out
again
overall
fairly
drinkable
for
a
smoked
brew
and
nicely
done
if
you
dont
want
to
be
completely
overwhelmed
with
smoke
in
a
rauchbier
more
smoke
in
the
nose
than
in
the
flavor
this
would
make
a
nice
compliment
to
chili
or
even
a
great
ingredient
in
a
pot
would
be
a
fun
beer
to
pair
with
bbq
or
other
foods
as
the
light
smoke
would
play
well
and
not
overwhelm
the
food
worth
a
try
this
is
a
nice
beer
not
great
but
it
does
drink
well
and
i
feel
it
would
work
nicely
as
a
fall
beer
especially
around
a
campfire
this
would
pair
awesomely
with
any
grilled
fare
d
fort
collins
has
had
a
lot
of
brews
that
i
have
enjoyed
a
lot
this
version
of
a
rauchbier
isnt
terrible
and
it
is
something
that
anybody
should
try
there
are
certainly
areas
that
could
be
improved
but
overall
i
was
quite
impressed
by
it
mouthfeel
is
creamy
smooth
and
finishes
with
a
sweetness
yet
semi
dry
finish
this
is
a
solid
brew
and
an
interesting
idea
to
make
a
rauchbier
out
of
an
amber
lager
rather
than
a
darker
sturdier
brew
but
it
works
well
here
burnt
orange
color
nice
smoked
malt
aroma
relatively
subtle
but
noticable
body
is
about
medium
but
firm
nice
smoked
malt
flavor
a
bit
of
caramel
as
well
clean
tasting
excellent
drinker
well
done
this
would
be
an
excellent
summer
bbq
beer
d
well
i
got
two
and
they
are
sadly
gone
but
i
have
to
agree
with
everyone
if
you
never
had
a
rauchbier
this
was
a
pretty
darn
good
one
such
a
unique
lager
everyone
should
try
this
once
just
to
experience
it
an
excellent
pairing
with
grilled
smoked
or
bbqd
meats
like
drinking
a
bbq
buy
again
yes
d
this
is
a
nice
and
safe
rauchbier
its
light
flavor
makes
it
a
good
intro
to
the
style
for
the
newcomer
a
nice
pickup
pours
an
orange
brown
color
with
a
medium
sized
peachy
head
a
mild
smokeyness
in
the
nose
which
is
very
dominated
by
a
sweet
malt
note
some
further
smokeyness
in
its
flavor
as
well
again
very
mild
good
active
carbonation
helps
its
drinkability
a
style
not
explored
by
many
us
brewers
for
a
reason
this
offering
was
average
at
best
would
i
buy
more
of
it
i
might
i
just
might
d
very
good
with
a
meal
on
its
own
this
might
be
a
little
too
unique
to
really
session
with
certainly
an
interesting
beer
i
kinda
dig
it
the
smoke
flavors
are
not
overpowering
making
this
an
interesting
change
of
pace
from
a
normal
amber
ale
based
on
this
beer
id
be
interested
in
trying
more
rauchbiers
the
burnt
orange
colored
body
was
topped
with
a
small
head
and
the
overall
presentation
was
typical
amber
lager
the
aroma
was
malty
and
mellow
with
the
smoke
only
evident
with
some
deep
breaths
the
taste
is
where
this
beer
fell
apart
for
me
all
i
got
was
slightly
smoky
flavor
and
sweetened
water
like
industrial
malt
taste
not
particularly
interesting
in
the
approach
except
the
hint
of
smoke
pretty
thin
in
the
mouth
as
well
with
a
zap
of
carbonation
like
soda
water
not
a
very
good
imitation
of
the
bamberg
classics
pours
a
nice
clear
coppery
amber
with
a
decent
if
not
persistent
offwhite
head
aroma
is
strong
and
malty
with
smoky
fruity
and
caramel
hints
mouthfilling
flavor
is
malty
and
slightly
fruity
with
a
hint
of
caramel
and
a
whisper
of
sweetness
texture
is
very
smooth
and
minimally
tingly

a
sixer
at
my
joint
on
sale
good
deal
i
guess
if
you
like
this
style
pours
a
rich
coppery
amber
with
a
very
miniscule
white
froth
for
a
head
which
dissappears
pretty
quickly
regardless
of
its
lack
of
body
the
smell
is
of
malts
with
a
barbecue
chicken
backbone
honestly
i
was
hoping
for
more
smoke
but
hey
thems
the
breaks
the
taste
pretty
much
follows
the
nose
but
the
smoke
is
thankfully
more
pronounced
bringing
the
desired
complexity
missing
from
the
smell
the
mouthfeel
is
a
little
on
the
slick
watery
side
but
this
does
serve
as
a
foil
to
the
smoke
leading
to
an
overall
high
level
of
drinkability
i
just
love
rauchbiers
this
is
not
the
best
i
have
had
but
it
is
certainly
a
winner
pours
a
lucid

goes
down

not
delicious
average
mouthfeel
appropriate
carbonation
dvery
drinkable
the
flavor
while
being
very
pallatable
a
standout
for
the
style
seems
restrained
which
combined
with
the
body
make
for
a
good
session
beer
though
im
not
sure
that
many
would
choose
it
nice
sweet
and
smoky

aroma
the
smoke
is
dialed
down
and
approachable
flavor
is
similar
sweet
and
a
hint
of
smoke
with
a
trace
of
dry
bitterness

aftertaste
lingers
for
awhile
mildly
dry
and
campfire
wood
smoke
feel
is
a
little
watery
as
the
carbonation
escapes
decent
enough
seems
like
a
nice
beer
for
a
rauch
beginner
or
for
a
fall
night
by
the
fire
drinkable
a
sipper
for
me
but
would
go
oh
so
well
with
some
choice
meaty
cheesy
foods
i
actually
like
this
style
quite
a
bit
at
least
from
what
i
can
tell
from
fort
collins
version
i
understand
there
are
smokier
versions
out
there
im
curious
to
try
them
at
some
point
im
kind
of
excited
that
i
like
this
style
seeing
as
how
it
may
not
be
the
most
popular
with
everyone
good
stuff
fort
collins
poured
into
a
pint
glass
this
brew
is
a
deep
amber
color
with
nice
red
tint
when
held
to
the
light
the
head
is
less
than
a
finger
and
leaves
nearly
no
cap
and
no
lacing
the
aroma
is
smoky
and
has
some
hints
of
caramel
and
thick
malts
the
taste
is
extremely
overwhelmed
by
smokiness
the
bottle
states
the
malts
are
dried
over
an
open
fire
this
seems
to
overpower
the
entire
brew
the
carbonation
is
nice
and
there
is
some
balance
with
hops
in
the
finish
but
it
is
very
hard
to
get
over
the
initial
taste
that
just
lingers
i
am
glad
i
purchased
this
as
a
single
as
i
am
not
going
to
have
again
beer
poured
a
clear
amber
with
a
white
head
that
is
barely
hanging
on
in
mid
glass
nose
is
smoked

but
not
overwhelming
as
one
might
think
taste
is
strong
on
smoked
malts
initially
with
an
unexpected
decent
bittering
hop
finish
mouthfeel
is
medium
bodied
and
lightly
carbonated
overall
drinkability
is
pretty
good
the
beer
is
initially
strong
on
the
smoke
but
becomes
more
agreeable
to
the
palate
as
the
bottle
is
consumed
it
is
drinkable
quite
drinkable
i
need
another
to
sparkle
that
aftertaste
away
pours
a
clear
copper
color
with
a
large
offwhite
head
that
had
excellant
retention
before
settling
to
a
thick
cap
a
good
amount
of
sticky
lacing
is
left
on
the
glass
aroma
has
the
appropriate
amount
of
smokey
charactor
a
touch
of
sweetness
is
lingering
underneath
the
smoke
the
smoke
goes
a
bit
mild
in
the
flavor
we
dont
want
to
offend
the
masses
type
of
way
still
quite
noticable
a
touch
of
sweetness
balances
things
out
i
would
of
liked
a
bit
more
smoke
to
bring
this
up
to
good
grade
levels
the
body
seems
a
little
thin
by
far
the
weakest
component
of
this
beer
a
more
sessionable
rauchbier
as
several
of
these
could
be
consumed
without
getting
tired
of
the
smoke
the
real
good
rauchbiers
makes
one
compare
them
to
ham
or
bacon
cannot
do
that
with
this
one
thanks
again
to
whoever
sent
this
to
me
sorry
i
took
so
long
to
get
to
it
normally
i
dont
appreciate
smoked
beers
and
this
one
was
really
pretty
nice
d
a
really
good
smokey
beer
i
wish
i
had
some
vegetarian
riblets
from
morningstar
farms
medium
bodied
with
an
appropriate
carbonation
level
surprisingly
easy
drinker
just
a
subtle
kiss
from
the
smoke
in
the
finish
very
very
pleasant
surprise
drinkability
while
not
a
bad
beer
this
one
was
a
bit
of
a
disappointment
the
smoky
taste
is
there
but
the
finish
is
harsh
i
may
have
this
again
but
i
think
there
are
way
better
in
the
style
d
this
is
my
first
rauchbier
its
a
very
interesting
style
that
im
glad
i
tried
this
wont
be
a
regular
drinking
brew
for
me
but
it
was
very
interesting
and
enjoyable
id
drink
this
again
but
ill
stick
to
one
per
session
this
beer
pours
a
clear
red
color
the
head
is
none
existent
the
aroma
is
smoke
with
a
hint
of
caramel
malt
it
is
a
rather
simple
aroma
the
taste
is
like
the
aroma
i
like
that
there
is
a
lot
of
smoke
but
there
isnt
nothing
else
the
mouthfeel
is
medium
bodied
with
moderate
carbonation
and
a
smooth
texture
overall
this
is
a
decent
beer
that
could
be
a
lot
better
if
it
had
a
more
complex
malt
bill
i
could
drink
it
again
but
there
are
better
smoked
beers
out
there
d
good
better
with
some
food
though
note
smokiness
seems
to
fade
as
you
drink
more
of
the
beer
which
could
be
good
or
bad
depending
on
how
much
you
like
the
smokey
flavor
taste
is
a
little
tame
but
a
nice
semisweet
lager
i
feel
like
im
describing
a
wine
smoke
flavor
is
far
in
the
back
backing
up
the
amber
flavor
fruity
around
the
edges
definitely
let
down
in
terms
of
smoke
flavor
but
im
enjoying
it
mouthfeel
is
a
hit
as
is
drinkability
because
its
a
nice
easy
drinking
flavorful
lager
which
is
why
i
like
this
style
we
used
to
get
kegs
of
rohrbachs
amber
lager
in
college
and
it
was
always
a
treat
not
sure
if
this
is
what
they
were
going
for
here
i
think
there
could
be
a
nice
imperial
version
of
this
in
the
making
in
my
basement
at
some
point
d
dry
finish
makes
this
a
very
drinkable
amber
in
spite
of
the
very
present
smoke
you
can
bet
i
order
this
if
i
see
it
on
tap
overall
this
was
definitely
in
the
bottom
half
of
rauchbiers
ive
had
however
it
may
be
a
good
gateway
beer
for
those
not
so
sure
about
smoked
malt
the
initial
smokiness
nods
at
rauchbier
but
id
like
to
see
a
deeper
smoke
this
is
a
solid
rauchbier
but
i
wouldnt
put
it
up
there
with
the
schlenkerla
beers
then
again
i
love
a
big
ole
super
smoky
rauchbier
so
take
that
statement
for
what
its
worth
d
easy
drinking
with
a
nice
flavor
profile
solid
smoke
presence
that
manages
to
stand
out
without
being
overpowering
i
dont
have
a
lot
of
experience
with
rauchbiers
but
enjoyed
this
offering
quite
a
bit
drinkability
is
good
not
an
overpowering
beer
but
a
nice
lager
with
a
subtle
smokey
flavor
overall
this
is
a
nice
smoked
beer
thats
subtle
enough
to
be
a
beer
to
drink
regularly
and
introduce
people
to
the
style
i
love
rauchbiers
and
could
drink
a
couple
of
these
pretty
easily
d
im
a
big
fan
of
smoked
beers
and
this
is
another
tasty
one
not
my
favorite
but
an
easy
drinking
one
that
i
wouldnt
mind
having
again
would
make
an
excellent
tailgatingcookout
beer
pours
a
smokey
dark
amber
hue
with
just
a
little
bubbling
ok
lacing
with
a
quick
ring
of
foam
smokey
bready
mlats
ad
a
little
bit
of
toasted
oak
and
a
little
campfire
caramel
and
bready
malts
with
a
dash
of
funky
hops
toasted
barrel
hits
the
middle
but
fades
away
to
the
finish
bringing
back
some
dark
caramel
the
palate
is
very
smooth
and
a
touch
of
smoke
since
the
smokiness
is
on
the
lighter
side
this
is
a
pretty
sessionable
rauchbier
overall
decent
but
nothing
inspiring
worth
a
bottle
or
2
d
a
decent
mouthfeel
and
taste
combination
makes
this
beer
pretty
easy
to
drink
as
more
of
the
smokiness
came
out
it
made
the
beer
nicer
decent
smokebeer
overall
d
im
a
big
fan
of
smoked
beers
and
this
is
another
tasty
one
not
my
favorite
but
an
easy
drinking
one
that
i
wouldnt
mind
having
again
would
make
an

beer
notes
this
was
so
welcomed
at
my
latest
grilling
session
smoky
and
flavorfulbut
not
overwhelming
so
far
gotta
love
the
fort
collins
lineup
these
beers
are
excellent
i
kept
on
passing
on
them
for
the
longest
time
they
definitely
need
a
rep
in
the
burgh
these
beer
has
potential
to
sell
anyways
this
smoked
lager
pours
a
beautiful
amber
ruby
hue
with
a
light
off
white
cream
colored
head
lacing
is
even
and
covers
the
edges
of
my
chalice
like
a
blancket
between
each
sip
a
great
nose
of
mild
smoked
malts
with
slightly
charred
wood
and
smoke
bacon
at
the
minimal
herbal
hops
also
play
nicely
with
the
smoked
malt
additions
classically
american
style
flavor
has
a
great
round
edge
of
smokiness
with
sweet
amber
and
caramel
malt
lager
characteristics
again
hop
flavor
comes
through
as
herbal
yet
the
flavor
that
finishes
the
beer
is
the
smoked
malt
kickin
through
like
an
american
version
of
spezial
ruachbier
great
stuff
its
not
going
to
kick
compared
to
an
scherlenkerla
bier
but
its
sweet
to
taste
the
german
influences
in
american
micros
mouthfeel
is
a
fuller
bodied
lager
soft
carbonation
with
lingering
smoked
wood
and
lightly
salted
smoked
meat
components
drinkability
overall
is
wonderful
a
beer
that
im
proud
to
represent
every
time
i
try
to
remember
my
z
beer
in
the
alphabetical
list
in
the
database
d
very
nice
the
smoke
is
readily
apparent
and
adds
a
great
deal
of
character
to
the
hoppy
amber
lager
body
but
it
does
not
overwhelm
the
palate
the
smoke
seems
a
bit
more
restrained
than
the
german
versions
that
i
have
had
but
it
has
all
of
the
same
qualities
and
could
be
a
good
introduction
to
the
style
a
great
example
of
the
style

a
32
ounce

at
deciccios
in

rubyblood
orange
tinged
amber
minor
head
and
just
a
smidge
of
lace
seems
to
be
on
the
low
carbonation
side
of
things
moderate
smoke
in
the
nose
pleasantly
malty
brew
noticable
but
fairly
restrained
levels
of
smoke
complexity
is
enjoyable
and
this
one
would
likely
go
well
with
some
bbq
nothing
amazing
but
pleasant
enough
smoke
up
offering
worth
a
try
for
those
with
a
taste
for
a
smike
infused
easy
drinking
lager
unfortunately
the
smokiness
in
the
flavor
is
a
bit
more
tame
but
still
tasty
has
a
heavy
caramely
malt
base
that
brings
forth
a
sweetness
that
does
not
match
really
well
with
smoky
and
salty
flavors
overall
though
it
is
a
pretty
impressive
offering
from
fcb
probably
the
first
i
have
had
that
i
would
actually
buy

sixer

try
z
lager
pours
a
dark
orange
with
a
thin
tan
head
from
a
brown
twelve
ounce
bottle
the
flavor
is
quite
malty
and
the
smoke
is
quite
noticeable
but
it
isnt
as
strong
as
the
smoke
in
some
german
rauchbier
that
ive
had
lots
of
caramel
as
this
beer
warms
not
bad
i
could
drink
a
few
of
these
this
beer
pours
a
gorgeous
clear
orangered
not
much
of
a
head
to
speak
of
what
is
there
recedes
very
quickly
with
a
tiny
little
white
film
layering
the
top
very
little
spotty
lacing
left
nose
is
of
deep
toasted
malts
and
smokiness
reminds
me
of
smoked
bacon
without
much
of
the
bacon
smell
taste
is
sweet
at
first
caramel
malts
lead
the
way
and
then
leads
in
to
toasted
malts
and
a
great
smoked
flavoring
theyve
blended
this
nicely
perfect
balance
of
sweet
and
smoked
mouthfeel
is
a
medium
bodied
smooth
beer
slightly
creamy
nicely
carbonated
slight
aftertaste
this
beer
goes
down
far
too
easily
a
definite
can
and
will
sit
with
it
for
an
evening
the
feel
is
lagery
smooth
but
with
a
creamy
ashy
feel
at
the
swallow
smoky
and
pretty
nice
really
a
lager
with
hints
of
smoke
rather
than
a
true
rauchbier
drinkability
just
the
right
amount
of
smoke
layered
onto
a
light
refreshing
lager
sort
of
the
young
kid
brother
of
the
schlenkerla
brews
paired
fairly
well
with
the
fish
n
chips
i
seem
to
consistently
give
beers
from
this
brewery
slightly
better
scores
than
other
bas
do
and
this
beer
is
no
exception
its
not
so
much
that
i
think
the
beers
are
stellar
but
merely
that
they
are
well
made
often
in
unexciting
styles
but
not
really
extreme
in
any
way
they
are
what
they
are
and
what
they
are
are
simple
wellmade
beers
now
a
rauchbier
might
not
fit
the
bill
for
that
philosophy
but
this
one
is
relatively
balanced
and
while
there
is
some
moderate
smokiness
it
isnt
quite
the
salami
taste
that
some
of
the
style
has
in
other
words
its
smoky
enough
to
be
interesting
but
still
accesible
enough
to
appeal
to
someone
who
isnt
used
to
the
style
brown
with
little
head
with
a
very
light
amount
of
malt
grain
and
smoke
on
the
nose
the
taste
is
a
bit
smokier
and
maltier
smooth
and
easy
to
drink
not
bad
at
all
d
interestingly
tasty
beer
with
good
balance
the
smoke
is
not
overdone
so
it
doesnt
taste
like
the
bottom
of
an
ashtray
i
dont
know
about
a
session
beer
but
id
definitely
drink
it
again
12
oz

smoke
is
really
just
an
accent
here
finishes
some
smoke
and
hops
very
drinkable
good
example
overall
a
great
beer
that
just
misses
on
being
legendary
since
the
awesome
smoke
aroma
and
taste
really
start
to
fade
halfway
thru
as
i
noted
earlier
mine
was
missing
some
head
and
lacing
that
others
got
so
i
may
not
have
had
a
fresh
one
will
need
to
retry
this
one
in
the
future
and
possibly
rereview
it
for
now
still
highly
recommend
as
is
it
would
be
a
player
in
the
rotation
if
the
smoke
sticks
around
longer
it
could
be
a
major
player
d
overall
not
a
bad
beer
i
just
like
a
more
smokey
meaty
flavor
in
my
smoked
beers
but
its
still
an
enjoyable
beer
to
drink
good
with
food
from
the
grill

reduces
to

back
it
all
up
it
has
a
lightish
dry
body
with
a
crisp
tingle
that
makes
this
beer
very
easy
to
drink
i
loved
this
one
incredibly
balanced
and
insanely
drinkable
if
i
had
to
critique
it
i
would
desire
a
more
robust
smokiness
but
as
it
is
its
a
very
approachable
and
refreshing
rauchbier
make
sure
you
grab
at
least
two
bottles
if
you
see
this
one
this
is
definitely
an
acquired
taste

had
other

tasting
beers

was

toasted
malts
and
then
some
sweeter
caramel
maybe
finishes
off
with
a
yest
cleanliness
lageresque
of
the
smoked
beer
ive
had
this
is
by
far
the
best
the
smoke
flavor
is
noticeable
but
not
overpowering
which
is
an
easy
error
to
make
as
far
as
ive
read
still
not
a
great
beer
but
very
good
for
its
category
pours
a
copper
color
with
the
tiniest
little
head
to
it
and
zero
lacing
smell
reminds
of
being
a
t
campground
when
i
was
younger
some
nice
smokiness
but
not
overpowering
nice
smooth
and
creamy
mouthfeel
and
nice
body
tastes
like
someone
blew
some
smoke
up
a
lagers
ass
literally
except
i
mean
this
in
a
good
way
very
easy
to
drink
i
was
actually
surprised
that
it
doesnt
taste
as
smokey
as
it
smells
and
felt
maybe
it
could
have
used
a
tad
more
taste
my
first
time
having
this
style
and
i
would
def
want
to
try
more
of
it
poured
out
into
a
pint
glass

with

smoke
the

definitely
comes
through
on
the
nose
a
lot
more
than
the
taste
mouthfeel
and
drinkability
are
both
average
dont
drink
and
review
mouthfeel
is
a
pretty
strait
forward
lager
body
i
guess
for
smoked
beers
i
lean
more
towards
porters
and
the
such
d
while
not
as
smoky
as
one
may
hope
for
this
does
make
for
a
nice
drinking
lager
that
is
highlighted
with
just
enough
of
a
smoky
presence
to
appreciate
fans
of
rauchbier
may
be
let
down
a
bit
expecting
a
barn
burner
like
aecht
schlenkerla
but
this
can
still
appreciated
for
its
clean
though
light
flavor
and
can
easily
be
session
material
z
is
a
decent
beer
a
good
one
even
but
nothing
stands
out
at
all
i
would
enjoy
this
with
a
grilled
beef
dish
but
its
never
going
to
blow
me
away
decent
effort
and
worth
picking
up
but
i
probably
wont
be
buying
it
again
my
first
smoked
amber
and
dont
know
what
to
expect
but
fort
collins
always
makes
some
good
brews
so
here
goes
pours
bright
red
with
a
fairly
dense
one
and
a
half
finger
tan
head
retention
is
good
with
a
couple
of
outcroppings
of
lace
left
behind
smells
of
sweet
malts
nuts
and
caramel
with
a
smoked
undercurrent
tastes
sweet
and
malty
at
first
then
some
earthiness
and
faint
notes
of
spice
come
into
play
the
smokey
affect
shows
itself
furtively
in
the
aftertaste
its
lightbodied
with
a
quick
burst
of
carbonation
bubbles
upon
a
good
shake
not
bad
for
my
first
smoked
amber
but
i
can
see
i
need
to
try
some
more
before
i
jump
to
any
major
conclusions
a
very
nice
little
beer
mild
smoke
character
but
adding
interest
and
well
integrated
surprisingly
sweet
on
the
finish
but
just
pulls
it
off
medium
to
light
bodied
slick
and
well
done
mouthfeel
i
would
appreciate
a
little
more
spritz
both
in
the
glass
and
the
mouth
but
not
worth
a
ding
bready
in
the
middle
smoky
up
front
and
a
sweet
linger
on
the
finish
the
way
the
savory
aspect
of
the
smoke
wonderfully
dissipates
into
this
balancing
sweetness
is
really
nice
some
caramel
in
the
nose
and
honey
in
the
mouth
probably
the
lightest
smoke
smoked
beer
ive
ever
had
but
an
enjoyable
drink
cheers
to
ft
collins
and
andrew
for
the
sample

is
great
for
a
smoked

taste
is
initially
fruity
and
sweet
quickly
moves
to
a

lightly

finish
mouthfeel
is
on
the
lighter
side
of
medium
has
a
more
subtle
kiss
of
carbonation
that
pushes
the
flavor
forward
at
a
moderate
pace
rather
than
overwhelms
drinkable
and
improved
when
paired
with

if

it

the

the

reason
these

is
that

served

with

had

poured
a
massively
dark
brown
basically
black
with
a
minimal
khaki
colored

maintained

lacing
throughout
the

the
aroma
was

of

smoked
malt
smoke
and

the
flavor
was
of
sweet

smoke
ham
milk
chocolate
and
dark
chocolate
it
had
a
medium
feel
on
the
palate
with
mild
carbonation
overall
this
was
a
pretty
good
brew
i
can
see
why
germans
love
this
style
of
brew
as
it
is
one
of
my
favorites
out
there
too
the
smokey
tones
come
through
very
nicely
on
this
brew
and
are
quite
refreshing
i
was
quite
concerned
upon
inspecting
and
smelling
the
cork
note
for
future
openers
of
beers
with
moldy
corks
do
not
smell
it
really
glad
this
didnt
translate
into
the
beer
at
all
a
definite
must
try
if
you
get
the
opportunity
to
do
so
this
is
a
very
unexpectedly
nice
beer
the
smokey
full
body
actually
makes
for
a
solid
cold
weather
offering
this
was
ultimately
not
worth
the
hype
or
pricetag
but
its
interesting
its
kinda
surprising
that
the
rauchschwarz
isnt
a
more
common
style
but
i
find
it
more
compatible
with
a
bock
or
wheat

very
nice
beer
that
straddles

for
awhile
and
i
am
glad
it
showed
up
on
tap
it
was
easy

very

do
this

provides
a

i
like
this
quite

went

fun
beer
overall
a

o
this
is
a
very
enjoyable
smoked
beer
and
a
good
effort
from
flying
dog
i
really
liked
this
one
worth
trying
if
toy
ever
see
it
around
o
just
enough
smoke
in
the
finish
to
make
it
a
unique
flavor
on
its
own
and
really
brought
out
the
sweet
heat
of
my
meal
the
7
8

is
detected
but
it
doesnt
impede
the
sweet
roasted
malts
and
smoky
finish
quite
tasty
and
brought
out
the
flavors
of
my
loaded
up
grilled
sausage
burger
nicely
overall
i
liked
this
one
a
tasty
and
approachable
smoked
beer
drinks
pretty
easy
i
think
even
non
smoked
beer
folks
would
enjoy
drinking
this
o
i
guess
i
was
expecting
the
smoke
flavor
to
be
more
prominent
but
to
be
fair
the
beer
is
probably
about
3
years
old
and
has
held
up
very
well
it
was
expensive
for
what
it
was
but
id
certainly
pay
1415
for
a
four
pack
of
this
if
flying
dog
ever
added
it
to
their
canis
major
series
this
beer
pours
out
like
a
cola
color
with
a
thick
tan
colored
head
on
it
the
head
leaves
a
really
good
lacing
down
the
glass
the
smell
of
the
beer
isnt
heavily
smoked
which
i
personally
like
there
is
a
light
hop
aroma
along
with
the
roasted
malts
on
the
nose
just
beyond
the
smoke
the
taste
isnt
overly
smokey
either
its
a
got
a
strong
hoppiness
to
it
than
anything
else
i
think
perhaps
its
the
bitterness
from
the
dark
malts
im
getting
the
mouthfeel
is
lighter
than
i
expected
it
to
be
overall
it
was
pretty
good
im
not
sure
if
id
seek
it
out
again
o
quite
nice
very
drinkable
for
a
smoked
brew
for
the
cash
i
am
unsure
why
this
is
so
expensive
its
nothing
like
a
aecht
schlenkerla
rauchbier
try
their
beers
and
if
possible
share
this
don
waste
your
time
o
i
like
the
smoke
but
the
flavor
is
just
off
dmost
american
smoked
or
rauchs
cant
equal
aecht
schlenkerla
but
this
one
does
highly
drinkable
an
interesting
beer
poured
cola
with
a
light
tan
head
smell
is
sweet
and
malty
maybe
a
bit
like
cocoa
powder
taste
is
sweet
with
a
bitter
finish
not
in
extreme
but
just
enough
to
make
it
work
as
a
bitter
sweet
taste
has
alot
in
common
with
a
porter
or
stout
but
with
an
interesting
almost
licorice
finish
it
has
a
smooth
finish
and
as
such
is
very
drinkable
beer
is
medium
to
light
in
body
with
a
nice
midpalate
full
of
hickory
smoke
the
finish
is
mildly
bitter
and
has
an
odd
almost
tannic
quality
to
it
this
is
why
i
think
the
bottle
was
old
i
think
it
may
have
been
slightly
corked
as
the
beer
waremed
up
it
got
a
little
more
bitter
and
started
tasting
like
cork
the
smoke
and
mild
sweetness
seemed
to
be
unaffected
by
late
corkiness
but
it
did
distract
and
detract
from
the
overall
experience
of
the

has

everything
is

i
thought
it

cool
camping
nights
definitely
grab
one
if
you
have
the
chance
overall
i
like
this
beer
the
balance
is
really
quite
good
without
any
flavor
overpowering
any
other
that
said
i
feel
like
the
roasty
flavors
are
almost
too
subtle
if
they
were
a
little
more
forward
i
think
this
could
be
a
really
outstanding
brew
f
semi
bitter
drier
lingering
smoke
and
smoked
meat
some
syrupy
sweetness
as
well
alcohol
is

this

is

to

this
didnt
live
up

definitely
a

but
i
didnt

it
had
enough
of
a
smoked
character
to
categorize
it
as
such
seems
to
me
its
a
schwarzbier
with
some
slightly
smoky
elements
i
guess
im
just
suffering
from
some

this
is
by
no

bad

drinkability

to
drink
for
a

hurts
that
i

had
a

are
by

the

in

this

is

i
just

mild

here

have
to
say
one
and
done
if
youre

on
bitterness
this
is
not
your
beer
its
also
significantly
smokier
than
many

of
like
a
very
dry
dry
stout
phonetic
spelling
of

a

reviewing
them
side

is
the
only
sensible
way
to
choose
between
weizenbock
and
dog
schwarz
as
the
best
of
the

wild

series
of
those
that
ive
had
so
far
unfortunately
the
insane
price
of
18
59
for
this
bottle
ensures
that
that
comparison
will
never
come
to
pass
if
it
was
12
id
buy
this
one
again
in
a
heartbeat
d
only
7
8
strong
flavor
and
malts
make
this
a
savory
delight
pair
it
with
food
hard
to
find
but
if
you
see
it
get
it
good
smoked
beer
no
schlenkerla
but
it
has
enough
smoke
to
keep
things
interesting
i
was
suprised
to
see
this
bottle
in
the
bottleshop
as
ive
never
heard
of
it
b4
and
usually
hear
about
most
of
the
flying
dog
brews
b4
they
arrive
so
stoked
to
try
something
a
little
different
from
them
anyways
the
brew
pours
a
lucious
dark
chocolate
colour
with
a
nice
tan
one
finger
head
and
sporadic
lacingthe
aroma
is
definately
original
it
has
smells
of
an
open
woodfireliquoricechocolate
and
some
boozy
coffeeit
has
a
nice
silky
mouthfeel
which
fills
the
palette
with
tastes
of
expressodark
chocolateroasted
malts
and
also
some
dark
berries
and
the
abv
is
well
hidden
but
the
last
taste
it
leaves
you
with
i
find
is
the
dominant
coffee
flavour
almost
like
you
have
just
drank
a
coffee
which
probably
made
my
drinkability
not
that
high
but
dont
get
me
wrong
i
will
easily
finish
this
750ml
bottle
i
personally
cannot
finish
this
bottle
but
like
i
said
i
think
it
is
just
that
im
not
familiar
with
the
style
at
least
i
tried
something
new

a

smelled
like
lots

smoke
and
oak
and

with
some
roasted

and

and
coffee
it
tasted
like
smoke
and
oak
and
peat
and
roasted
coffee
with
some
burnt
barley
and
a
bit
of
molasses
it
was
fairly
thick
with
a
bit
of
carbonation
and
had
a
bitter
smoky
aftertaste
overall
this
had
a
nice
rich
flavor
with
great
body
it
had
tons
of
smoke
of
course
but
it
wasnt
too
overwhelming
and
the
peat
flavors
made
this
seem
more
like
scotch
the
alcohol
was
hidden
quite
well
but
this
is
still
more
of
a
sipping
beer
due
to
the
bold
flavors
this
beer
would
be
perfect
with
a
bbq
cookout
d
this
is
a
very
tasty
to
me
beer
but
such
strong
flavors
and
the
7
5
abv
could
make
this
a
challenge
to
even
finish
much
less
drink
more
than
one
the
excessive
carbonation
can
be
a
bit
annoying
at
first
luckily
some
persistent
aggressive
swirling
brings
this
down
to
a
reasonable
level
the
initial
hard
carbonation
accentuates
a
burnt
roast
vegetal
note
that
i
find
in
some
roasted
grain
malt
heavy
beers
that
is
a
touch
off
putting
but
remains
fairly
light
and
does
disappear
as
the
carbonation
does
in
the
end
this
beer
is
quite
enjoyable
i
like
how
the
light
smokiness
makes
this
a
rich
tasting
brew
even
though
the
aroma
is
a
touch
too
flat
though
still
enjoyable
definitely
another
solid
wild
dog
beer
from
this
brewery
d
i
liked
this
one
the
smoky
character
takes
the
lead
from
start
to
finish
but
it
never
gets
too
overpowering
or
cloying
instead
its
rather
delicate
actually
drinkability
delicious
stuff
once
you
get
the
bottle
open
would
definitely
have
again
if
theres
anything
to
fault
the
dog
schwarz
its
just
that
theres
just
not
enough
of
the
dog
schwarz
the
restraint
of
the
smokiness
and
the
superb
balance
are
great
but
at
the
same
time
i
really
feel
there
could
have
been
more
flavor
overall
and
still
maintained
the
balance
overall
its
more
like
a
smoked
schwarz
than
a
double
smoked
schwarz
on
that
note
im
off
ive
got
to
try
to
sell
the
empty
bottle
on
ebay
to
recoup
some
of
my
costs

for

this
it
was
a
deliciously
balanced
strong
smoke
beer
poured
black
with
a
short

head
sure
it
tastes
kind
of
like
bacon
but
like
a
good
rauchbier
theres
more
to
it
im
reminded
of
the
smell
of
cedar
planks
on
the
grill
for
a
toasted
wood
flavor
the
background
malts
have
a
touch
of
caramel
with
smooth
dark
chocolate
very
drinkable
for
a
good
smokey
beer
worth
a
try
i
liked
the
effort
here
a
schwarbier
with
a
bit
of
smokey
rauch
attitude
seemed
to
be
what
they
were
shooting
for
here
and
for
the
most
part
they
succeeded
i
personally
would
have
liked
to
have
had
a
bit
more
smoke
in
the
taste
but
hey
that
may
just
be
me
on
a
side
note
while
i
liked
this
for
the
most
part
imho
this
is
not
worth
the
1517
per
bottle
that
most
places
are
selling
it
for
they
need
to
release
this
in
sixpacks
and
make
it
a
fall
release
a
good
variant
of
the
rauchbier
generally
found
in
amber
beers
out
of
bamberg
germany
they
create
a
mouthful
of
beef
jerky
and
bacon
however
with
the
darker
roastier
flavors
of
a
shwarzbier
and
different
complexity
is
created
hint
of
chocolate
maybe
dark
fruit
are
just
highlights
of
something
that
tastes
like
it
was
pulled
out
of
a
campfire
this
was
a
pricey
beer
but
definitely
worth
it
highly
recommended
d
the
7
5
dark
lagerrauchbier
qualities
still
well
referenced
a
very
drinkable
beer
and
one
i
would
definietly
look
forward
to
tasting
again
the
combo
of
schwarzrauch
is
very
well
matched
i
was
wishing
there
was
more
when
the
bottle
was
finished
light
syrupy
black
and
maple
syrup
colored
brew
great
to
finger
plus
brown
head
that
quietly
returns
to
the
black
smokey
hickory
some
charcoal
heavily
roasted
malts
and
even
some
pipe
tobacco
charcoal
roasted
malt
that
was
first
smoked
over
hickory
oak
and
some
peet
the
smokey
malts
help
accentuate
the
pipe
tobacco
flavor
while
the
peet
rounds
out
the
taste
with
an
earthy
finish
very
silky
but
a
little
syrupy
still
a
nice
rauchbier
good
sipping
this
brewery
makes
very
good
beers
but
this
one
was
definitely
a
letdown
with
how
good
its
overall
rating
is
i
wonder
if
i
might
not
have
gotten
a
bad
bottle
however
given
the
fact
that
a
bottle
runs
about
16
i
dont
think
ill

a
very
enjoyable
and
refreshing
beer
clean
simple
and
characterful
at
first
i
was
apprehensive
about
opening
the
bomber
because
i
didnt
know
if
the
boldness
and
smoke
flavor
would
wear
on
me
quickly
but
now
that
i
am
at
the
tail
end
of
the
bottle
i
could
easily
open
another
on

note
it
must
have
been
hard
for
flying
dog
to
make
a
sub50ibu
beer
overall
a
pretty
amazing
smoke
beer
the
balance
act
that
this
beer
showed
between
the
smokey
flavor
and
the
rest
of
the
taste
was
a
marvel
in
itself
it
was
the
perfect
combination

the
taste
was
plein
de
smoke
along
with
some
fruit
although
a
smooth
mouthfeel
this
one
just
isnt
that
drinkable
to
me
i
do
not
like
smoky
beers
and
this
one
definitely
isnt
worth
its

go
ahead
and
try
this

if
its

youre

i
also
have
difficulty
categorizing
this

the
label
says
its
a
smoked
double
lager
and
calls
it
a
schwarzbier
but
i
have
to
agree
with
the
previous
reviewer
and
say
that
it
is
a
rauchbier
its
a
dark
brown
color
with
beautiful
red
highlights
a
thick
tan
head
that
left
a
bit
of
lacing
once
you
catch
a
whiff
theres
no
doubt
its
a
rauchbier
very
strong
but
pleasant
smoke
aroma
the
smoke
is
less
noticeable
in
the
taste
where
the
malt
predominates
just
an
incredibly
smooth
beer
one
that
i
want
to
get
more
of
second

best
before
date
d
i
would
have
this
again
when
im
in
a
mood
for
rauchbier
but
want
something
lighter
cheers
overall
ordinarily
it
seems
like
if
you
take
something
great
and
make
it
bigger
youll
make
it
even
better
however
i
actually
liked
the
maerzen
better
than
this
bock
version
to
their
credit
the
brewers
at
spezial
jacked
up
the
bitterness
to
keep
this
bock
balanced
but
while
i
didnt
feel
overwhelmed
i
just
felt
like
some
of
the
nuances
were
lost
definitely
try
this
if
you
get
a
chance
but
dont
feel
bad
if
youre
there
at
a
time
other
than
late
october
through
christmas
and
you
have
to
settle
for
the
maerzen
this
bockbier
poured
a
dark
coffeebrown
color
with
light
brown
sudsy
foam
that
settled
the
smell
was
malty
and
slightly
tangy
but
mild
the
taste
was
malty
with
some
caramel
but
not
very
sweet
there
was
a
tanginess
and
a
hint
of
hops
in
the
finish
the
mouthfeel
was
smooth
and
malty
with
medium
light
body
there
was
a
lingering
tangy
and
hoppy
aftertaste
the
drinkability
was
good
this
was
a
somewhat
dry
and
easy
to
drink
bock
adored
by
many
who
dont
adore
schlenkerla
it
is
close
to
my
favorite
bamberg
bier
while
i
love
them
all
i
always
visit
the
spezial
for
their
beer
good
beer
some
smoke
but
not
overwhelming
try
it
if
you
can
find
it
starts
with
salty
earthy
malts
and
a
good
amount
of
smoked
ham
while
malts
tend
to
turn
sweeter
while
drinking
lively
carbonation
supports
big
waves
of
smoke
while
only
a
whiff
of
salt
shines
through
finishes
with
a
short
dry
glance
then
sweeter
toffeeish
malts
go
well
along
with
the
smokiness
o
was
not
impressed
i
understand
a
classic
rauchbier
is
not
meant
to
be
an
in
your
face
beer
but
i
was
comparing
it
on
schlenkerlas
offerings
and
this
is
definitely
subdued
and
lacking
complexity
by
comparison
definitely
the
worst
tasting
beer
ive
ever
tried
although
perhaps
not
the
absolute
worst
overall
about
five
different
people
at
a
party
tried
a
sip
of
this
and
all
formed
similar
opinions
this
one
was
drain
pour
pure
and
simple
all
in
all
a
nice
rauchbier
starter
beer
less
aggressively
over
the
top
than
others
turns
out
this
is
a
rauchlager
wasnt
expecting
that
the
taste
was
quite
hammy
and
smoky
the
nose
didnt
indicate
too
much
smoke
and
was
a
lot
less
dull
than
the
beers
i
had
at
schlenkerla
still
a
wonderful
brew
had
a
couple
while
chatting
with
this
new
found
brit
beer
enthusiast
and
the
night
went
downhill
from
there
beer
is
medium
to
mediumlight
in
body
with
medium
to
mediumhigh
carbonation
levels
this
results
in
a
semifizzy
mouthfeel
that
is
wellmatched
by
the
weight
of
the
beer
does
not
close
dryly
d
for
me
by
far
the
best
rauchbier
in
bamberg
this
baconblack
pudding
note
is
awesome
with
the
kiss
of
biscuit
malts
it
goes
down
far
too
easy
excellent
nothing
really
stands
out
on
the
palate
but
you
get
a
nice
array
of
smoked
meat
and
camp
fire
flavors
with
the
sweet
caramel
and
bready
malts
rather
light
on
the
body
and
crisp
making
for
quite
an
enjoyable
but
more
delicate
rauchbeer
overall
a
solid
tasty
brew
and
a
nice
alternative
when
you
want
just
a
bit
of
smoke
as
opposed
to
the
wonderful
onslaught
you
get
from
schlenkerla
half
litre
bottle
golden
colour
clear
small
poorly
retained
head
aroma
was
like
a
smokery
as
was
the
case
with
the
other
rauchbiers
ive
sampled
smoke
was
understated
tasted
malty
with
hints
of
apple
smoke
gave
the
beer
more
character
than
expected
for
a
beer
of
4
6
abv
crisp
body
smooth
texture
with
more
carbonation
than
expected
overall
a
very
well
balanced
beer
where
the
smoke
is
present
but
not
over
powering
overall
a
very
solid
rauchbier
although
not
quite
in
the
same
league
as
the
schlenkerla
series
something
i
would
pick
up
again
if
i
ever
saw
it
though
the
beer
pours
an
orange
color
with
a
white
head
as
a
fan
of
smoked
beers
the
aroma
is
great
i
get
a
ton
of
heavy
meaty
smoke
with
not
too
much
else
coming
through
the
flavor
is
a
little
bit
more
complex
there
is
still
a
ton
of
meaty
smoke
as
well
as
a
little
bit
of
sweetness
from
the
toffee
malt
medium
mouthfeel
and
medium
carbonation
nice
rauchbier
not
as
smokey
as
some
but
still
plenty
of
that
campfire
essence
to
it
pours
rich
copper
in
color
with
a
slender
tan
head
that
doesnt
last
too
long
smells
like
smoke
dark
german
malts
and
even
a
touch
of
wheat
malt
flavor
is
smokey
up
front
a
little
woody
in
the
middle
before
the
semisweet
malt
finish
draws
on
feel
is
good
mellow
carbonation
and
a
lighter
body
than
the
color
would
indicate
very
drinkable
in
the
summer
season
particularly
moving
into
fall
overall
a
nice
beer
lighter
on
the
smoke
than
some
other
rauchbiers
and
rather
affordable
pours
a
slightly
hazy
amber
with
a
1
inch
puffy
light
tan
head
that
settles
to
a
foamy
film
on
top
of
the
beer
chunky
rings
of
lace
form
around
the
glass
on
the
drink
down
smell
is
of
grainmalt
and
some
subtle
smoke
aromas
taste
is
of
smoked
malt
up
front
with
a
light
fruity
flavor
on
the
finish
the
smoke
in
the
taste
is
also
pretty
subtle
and
doesnt
stick
around
on
the
palate
very
long
this
beer
has
a
light
level
of
carbonation
with
a
slightly
crisp
mouthfeel
overall
this
is
a
pretty
good
beer
but
the
smoke
in
the
aroma
and
flavor
is
pretty
mild
overall
a
little
low
in
character
for
the
style
but
very
clean
and
refreshing
this
one
would
be
great
with
some
mexican
food
not
bad
but
the
metallic
flavor
on
top
of
the
heavy
smoked
meat
makes
this
more
of
a
one
and
done
for
me
i
am
not
a
huge
fan
of
the
style
but
even
so
aecht
schlenkerla
blows
this
out
of
the
water
overall
its
okay
nothing
more
o
really
nice
rauchbier
not
in
the
same
league
as
schlenkerla
but
a
nice
diversion
nonetheless
its
been
over
a
year
since
i
last
tried
this
stuff
which
means
its
been
too
long
right
it
pours
a
mostly
clear
sunset
rust
topped
by
over
a
finger
of
thick
dirty
cream
froth
the
nose
comprises
light
toffee
being
dominated
by
a
strong
though
still
nowhere
near
oerbearing
beech
smoke
coming
off
almost
like
a
mutedly
honeysmoked
ham
this
one
though
is
earthier
than
most
german
rauchbiers
ive
had
with
a
twinge
of
wet
soil
and
dark
greens
seeping
into
the
background
its
meek
and
doesnt
hurt
the
overall
smokiness
much
but
it
is
noticeable
the
taste
brings
in
more
of
the
same
with
this
earthiness
toneddown
to
a
nice
mild
grassy
quality
the
smoke
isnt
exactly
strong
but
its
in
no
way
subtle
the
body
is
a
light
medium
with
a
light
moderate
carbonation
and
a
somewhat
slick
feel
overall
a
damn
fine
rauchbier
its
not
as
good
as
the
schlenkerlas
but
it
definitely
comes
very
close
d
this
is
suprisingly
refreshing
and
crisp
pretty
good
beer
dr
low
abv
and
good
pricing
but
limited
drinkability
vey
much
different
then
aecht
schlenkerla
that
im
most
familiar
with
but
good
too
this
rauchbier
is
wellbalanced
yet
personally
leaves
me
wanting
more
when
i
think
rauchbier
im
reminded
of
schenkerlas
powerful
märzen
if
youve
had
it
you
know
what
i
mean
overall
great
nice
smoke
that
isnt
overpowering
great
crisp
lager
flavors
nice
malts
almost
oktoberfest
like
this
beer
is
an
average
colored
lightamber
colored
lager
the
head
is
soapy
white
and
firm
and
the
beer
is
sufficiently
clear
the
smell
is
smoky
like
a
good
smoked
salmon
and
a
bit
grainy
slightly
astringentsmelling
with
some
wood
and
slight
medicinal
smell
the
taste
is
light
and
dry
smoke
is
prominent
in
the
taste
the
beer
is
light
in
mouthfeel
and
sweeter
than
expected
from
the
smell
interesting
but
not
really
a
great
brew
pours
a
moderate
goldenbrown
color
with
a
thin
offwhite
head
a
bit
of
lacing
the
nose
is
nice
with
a
bit
of
bacon
and
smoked
meats
plus
actually
some
normal
malt
slightly
earthy
as
well
the
flavor
is
really
nice
and
balanced
between
the
base
malt
and
some
smoke
the
smoke
is
there
for
sure
but
it
doesnt
take
over
the
entire
beer
which
is
actually
pretty
nice
really
easy
to
drink
without
thinking
about
coughing
medium
body
and
good
carbonation
highly
enjoyable
drinkability
well
balanced
equally
drinkable
lager
the
appearance
on
this
beer
was
pretty
nice
looks
like
just
about
any
other
lager
the
color
was
a
yellowish
gold
with
a
white
head
on
top
the
aroma
had
a
light
smokiness
to
it
nothing
overpowering
the
lager
aroma
was
there
too
there
were
malts
and
some
grassy
notes
in
there
as
well
the
taste
was
also
lightly
smoked
kind
of
nice
that
it
was
on
the
lighter
side
this
allowed
the
lager
flavors
to
remain
there
as
well
the
mouthfeel
is
light
and
bubbly
much
like
most
german
lagers
overall
this
was
a
decent
brew
overall
fine
but
no
reason
to
prefer
over
another
smoky
beer
light
bodied
too
light
and
thin
in
my
opinion
lightly
carbonated
a
decent
beer
but
not
one
of
the
better
rauchbiers
i
have
had
somewhat
disappointing
i
wish
this
would
have
been
smokier
i
still
dig
it
overall
seem
to
push
the
right
rauchbier
buttons
for
me
so
i
still
dig
it
o
the
beer
is
very
easy
to
drink
but
the
smokiness
is
a
bit
more
subtle
compared
to
other
rauchbiers
this
beer
could
serve
as
a
good
introduction
to
the
style
for
a
novice
because
the
smoke
doesnt
overpower
the
taste
pours
a
clear
amber
color
13
inch
head
of
an
offwhite
color
good
retention
and
slight
lacing
smells
of
sweet
malt
slight
nut
slight
earthy
malt
smoke
and
a
hint
of
pale
malt
fits
the
style
of
a
rauchbier
mouth
feel
is
sharp
and
crisp
with
an
average
carbonation
level
tastes
of
smoke
sweet
malt
hint
of
earthy
malt
hint
of
pale
malt
hint
of
roasted
malt
and
a
hint
of
hop
overall
a
good
session
beer
smoke
essence
isnt
as
strong
as
i
would
like
but
still
well
done
d
good
flavor
and
aroma
clean
body
but
less
than
impressive
appearance
the
flavor
is
not
as
robust
imo
as
other
rauchbiers
from
bamberg
beer
is
light
in
body
and
minimally
flavored
until
the
smoke
comes
up
on
the
second
half
of
the
palate
and
finishes
oddly
bitter
and
dry
overall
its
not
my
favorite
rauchbier
but
im
glad
i
had
it
i
doubt
i
would
return
to
it
though
d
while
perhaps
the
mouthfeel
could
be
thicker
the
drinkability
is
high
i
inadvertently
drained
my
glass
in
short
time
and
wished
i
had
more
ill
be
having
this
again
rauchbiers
are
an
interesting
set
of
tastes
this
one
goes
a
little
too
far
into
the
carbon
for
me
like
picking
something
out
of
the
charcoal
and
giving
it
a
taste
edit
had
this
in
bamberg
and
its
just
as
good
if
not
better
great
pairing
with
some
jagerschnitzel
too
i
prefer
it
to
the
ones
from
schlenkerla
and
would
say
its
definitely
among
the
top
beers
in
town
in
fact
id
say
everything
they
had
was
top
notch
pours
a
clean
orangeish
to
copper
color
with
a
white
head
in
the
aroma
a
small
hint
of
smoke
and
a
smell
of
sweet
tea
in
the
taste
small
dry
smoke
and
a
hint
of
sweet
tea
maltiness
a
small
bite
and
medium
to
light
bodied
mouthfeel
with
a
small
dry
tea
like
aftertaste
light
smoke
and
a
big
presence
of
sweet
tea
malt
and
a
hint
of
lemon
im
a
bit
disappointed
the
malt
character
needs
some
depth
it
is
a
lager
but
this
seems
to
be
a
decision
of
smoke
over
all
other
beer
elements
and
there
it
fails
a
bit
the
smoke
isnt
overpowering
the
liquid
bacon
factor
doesnt
come
into
play
it
just
lacks
a
bit
more
depth

more
of
the
style
drank
this

numerous

living

the
export
bottles
in
the
us
just
arent
nearly
on

with
what
you
can

in

still
nice
to
have
it
once
in

to
bring
back
the
memories
when
in

join
the
locals
at
the
long
tables
and
drink
the
smoked

bambergers
drink
overall
this
was
good
and
definitely
in
my
top
3
beers
from
bamberg
ill
drink
it
again
but
only
one
per
sitting
i
enjoyed
this
thoroughly
on
the
whole
the
subtle
smoke
complex
malt
profile
and
low
alcohol
made
it
a
pleasure
to
drink
not
at
all
what
i
expected
but
no
misgivings
here
as
i
saddled
up
to
the
other
side
bar
on
a
cold
wet
spring
day
i
decided
on
the
rauchbier
much
maligned
sadly
it
seemed
like
the
perfect
day
for
a
deep
smoky
rich
beer
instead
of
a
porter
as
i
had
some
great
lamb
meatloaf
awaiting
me
instead
a

the

stuck
about
in
small
pockets
and
minimized
on

as
i
drank
i
thought
that
the
aroma
would
be
smoky
as
well
but
only
in
a
subtle
if
you
were
looking
for
it
youd
notice
it
kind
of
way
likewise
with
the
flavor
only
a
subtle
smokiness
that
rounded
off
the
malt
flavors
in
this
exceptional
near
dunkel
lager
fresh
crisp
and
a
bit

bright

liquid
crystal
clear
with
a

dissipating
head
the
aroma
is
milder
and
more
refined
than
other
rauchbier
that
ive
tried
mostly
schlenkerla
spezials
lager
tends
more
toward
rich
caramel
and
fruity
malt
the
smoke
doesnt
make
the
beer
feel
old
or
hammy
its
more
like
a
fresh
mesquiteish
accent
to
a
nice
malty
lager
the
flavor
is
relatively
sweet
but
also
much
bigger
than
its
abv
would
suggest
a
bit
like
a
good
mild
its
a
great
malty

flavor
nutty
and
yeasty

very
good
lager
this
was
another
nice
smoked
beer
the
smoke
was
very
subtle
and
really
served
to
enhance
the
beers
flavors
without
overpowering
them
smells
fruity
there
is
smoke
there
as
well

its
not

the
smoke

with
a
equally
pleasant
toasty
lager
again
not
as
smoke
heavy
as
many
rauchs
but
still
plenty
good
enough
overall
a
great
beer
that
isnt
for
all
but
can
be
something
to
be
accustomed
to
drinkability
this
one
drinks
like
a
smoked
amber
it
is
super
easy
to
drink
even
with
the
high
carbonation
the
smoke
is
strong
and
pleasant
i
could
have
several
on
tap
at
deep
ellum

served
in
a
0
4l
german
mug
dark
amber
color
fizzy
white
head
that
faded
quickly
slight
smell
of
smoke
in
the
nose
nice
peaty
and
smoky
flavor
but
not
as
intense
as
a
typical
rauchbier
since
this
is
a
lager
i
feel
that
the
brewer
wanted
to
tone
that
aspect
down
a
bit
so
that
it
retained
some
of
the
drinkability
of
a
lager
that
is
the
quality
that
i
liked
the
most
it
had
that
smoky
flavor
but
was
easy
to
drink
in
a
big
german
beer
mug
light
enough
body
but
had
just
enough
malt
behind
it
to
make
it
a
sturdy
brew
a
nice
beer
for
smoked
beer
lovers
and
a
nice
beer
for
lager
drinkers
best
of
both
worlds
paired
nicely
with
my
pasta
with
sage
and
pumpkin
cream
sauce
poured
into
an
english
style
pint
glass
hazy
goldamber
color
with
a
big
bubbled
head
that
very
slowly
disapates
into
a
thin
film
with
almost
no
lacing
slight
smokey
aroma
very
little
smoke
in
taste
but
i
thought
this
was
a
very
good
german
lager
i
like
the
stronge
smokey
beers
which
this
is
not
yet
i
still
enjoyed
this
beer
i
have
a
friend
that
is
not
crazy
about
rauchbiers
but
i
think
he
would
enjoy
this
very
drinkable
taste
is
surprisingly
not
overly
smoky
there
is
a
bit
here
and
there
but
the
flavor
profile
overall
is
very
much
in
line
with
a
munich
dunkel
a
good
dunkel
at
that
and
the
hints
of
smoke
make
it
that
much
more
enjoyable
good
beer
but
needs
more
smoke
of
course
that
is
coming
from
someone
who
could
use
more
smoke
in
the
skerlenka
urbock
this
would
be
a
good
intro
into
the
world
of
bamburg
produced
rauchbiers
bottle
into
maß
appearance
is
not
bad
but
doesnt
inspire
particular
hope
either
not
much
smoker
taste
either
real
disappointing
the
feel
is
ok
but
the
body
isnt
carbonated
enough
the
colour
is
like
a
light
coke
the
head
is
slightly
brown
overall
i
am
quite
disappointed
with
this
beer
compared
to
the
schlenkerla
urbock
and
regular
poured
into
an
imperial
pint
glass
formed
a
14
offwhite
head
over
the
cloudy
orangey
amber
brew
head
is
quickly
down
to
an
uneven
layer
of
bubbles
leggy
with
average
lacing
aroma
is
sweet
leathery
smokey
with
a
touch
of
citrus
taste
is
very
sweet
to
start
countered
some
by
bitterness
starting
in
the
late
middle
with
the
smoke
blowing
through
but
not
dominant
mouthfeel
is
smooth
possibly
due
to
low
carbonation
and
drinkability
is
alright
okay
amount
of
smoke
in
an
okay
beer
d
must
be
a
bad
day
for
beer
in
my
world
2
disappointments
in
a
row
and
im
about
to
just
call
it
a
night
maybe
this
bottle
is
old
i
cant
find
a
freshness
date
drinkability
is
superior
the
comparatively
low
alcohol
content
makes
this
beer
a
good
candidate
for
a
summer
time
cold
beer
refresher
unfortunately
the
price
per
bottle
that
i
pad
means
there
are
lots
of
potential
competitors
with
a
far
more
satisfying
flavor
profile
d
i
wish
this
had
more
smoke
but
was
pleased
overall
since
the
smoothness
of
the
lager
makes
it
very
drinkable
d
i
could
drink
this
all
night
in
fact
i
did
in
bamberg
nicely
drinkable
and
did
go
well
with
some
food
pork
it
just
wasnt
as
exciting
as
i
had
hoped
frankly
id
reach
for
a
rogue
smoke
beer
long
before
trying
this
again
d
this
is
an
ok
but
not
great
rauchbier
there
are
better
examples
of
this
style
to
be
found
mild
smokiness
just
seemed
way
too
subtle
to
me
d
its
a
reasonable
quaffer
as
far
as
alcohol
content
goes
but
it
ends
there
it
was
all
unfortunate
as
the
style
can
be
incredibly
good
and
i
had
really
hoped
for
a
more
assertive
and
robust
beer
drinkability
is
poor
for
a
rauchbier
this
brew
is
not
impressive
the
smoked
character
is
almost
nonexistant
on
the
palate
even
though
the
aroma
is
quite
promising
this
one
is
easily
passed
up
for
a
schlenkerla
not
recommended
this
was
a
refreshing
beer
with
an
interesting
smokey
flavor
at
first
i
didnt
care
for
the
taste
of
this
beer
but
after
having
a
few
sips
it
started
to
grow
on
me
i
would
recommend
trying
a
rauchbier
if
you
have
never
had
one
they
arent
for
everyone
but
who
knows
you
might
be
in
for
a
treat
not
an
everyday
beer
but
if
youre
interested
in
the
style
this
is
what
i
recommend
taste
is
malty
with
some
smoke
not
the
like
a
bonfire
smokiness
but
battling
with
the
malt
for
first
place
the
malt
is
sweet
and
has
some
biscuity
and
honey
notes
although
smoked
beers
are
not
widespread
this
beer
has
a
typical
german
character
a
clean
well
brewed
beer
with
a
bottom
fermented
taste
aftertaste
is
smokey
and
a
little
dry
it
seems
like
the
bitterness
also
comes
from
the
smoked
malt
not
too
strong
on
the
alcohol
at
all
i
could
drink
a
few
of
these
no
problem
d
this
one
is
decent
though
by
no
means
the
best
rauchbier
that
ive
tasted
smooth
light
to
medium
body
with
touch
of
astringency
near
the
finish
crisp
carbonation
complementary
copper
color
body
with
a
filmysoapy
head
smell
may
hint
on
smokiness
but
only
if
youre
looking
for
it
some
tame
sweet
malt
and
slight
caramel
overall
this
beer
is
semi
ordinary
a
slight
hint
at
smokiness
comes
through
perhaps
im
being
overly
critical
but
ive
had
better
rauchbiers
for
sure
pours
a
slightly
hazy
iced
tea
color
with
a
smallish
off
white
head
the
aroma
is
very
doughy
like
a
helles
lager
sweet
with
honey
i
cant
really
pick
up
much
smoke
in
the
nose
the
taste
is
of
munich
malt
doughy
and
sweet
there
is
a
very
light
metal
flavor
as
well
as
a
meaty
smoke
flavor
the
smoke
is
subtle
and
not
over
the
top
picture
a
helles
dunkel
with
a
touch
of
smoke
the
feel
is
light
with
prickly
carbonation
sweet
overall
a
bit
of
a
meaty
aftertaste
a
fairly
easy
drinking
brew
nice
munich
malt
flavor
with
a
touch
of
smoke
everything
is
kept
in
check
clear
amber
with
a
white
head
the
taste
is
malty
grainy
bready
with
some
smoke
in
the
aftertaste
the
smokiness
is
very
subdued
like
sitting
a
few
tables
away
from
the
beef
jerky
instead
of
having
it
shoved
in
your
face
great
beer
if
not
the
best
in
town
the
mouthfeel
and
taste
were
lighter
than
i
expected
quite
drinkable
quite
frankly
too
bland
for
me
to
ever
want
to
drink
again
halfliter
german
bottle
with
some
code
on
the
front
label
it
is
a
clear
light
amber
beer
with
two
fingers
of
semicreamy
light
tan
head
that
takes
several
minutes
to
recede
smells
of
helles
with
a
hint
of
smoke
a
mildly
husky
graininess
and
some
late
earthymalty
notes
the
flavor
reveals
a
tame
rauch
with
hints
of
beech
a
mild
sweetness
and
some
lightly
earthy
and
grassyspicy
noble
hops
that
impart
a
medium
bitterness
the
body
is
light
to
medium
crisp
and
clean
with
a
nice
dry
and
hoppy
finish
overall
it
comes
across
as
a
soso
rauch
but
as
a
great
helles
very
drinkable
and
damn
tasty
but
some
more
smoke
would
make
for
a
truly
great
rauchbier
pours
a
nice
honey
orange
with
a
tall
taupe
head
the
foam
doesnt
have
a
lot
of
staying
power
reducing
to
a
small
solid
cap
quite
quickly
but
it
does
leave
a
decent
amount
of
lacing
smells
sweetly
malty
initially
but
a
light
woody
smoke
aroma
hits
soon
after
surprising
fruitiness
thats
i
havent
found
in
many
lagers
the
taste
is
equally
nice
quite
malt
concentrated
but
not
overly
sweet
the
smoke
flavor
is
quite
mild
and
works
well
to
dry
out
the
malt
interesting
slightly
tart
finish
thickish
feel
overall
a
very
nice
smokebeer
thats
quite
easy
to
drink
makes
schlenkerla
especially
the
weizen
seem
like
liquid
smoke
vary
chalky
smoky
kind
of
taste
to
it
it
was
too
burnt
in
my
opinion
tingles
a
bit
on
the
tongue
not
a
bad
beer
it
just
doesnt
do
muc
hfor
me
but
it
looks
cool
the
base
beer
character
is
a
bit
underwhelming
and
is
not
fully
fermented
but
the
softer
smoke
flavor
balances
the
beer
in
the
absence
of
hops
and
offers
enough
variety
to
keep
the
beer
from
boredom
beyond
this
dinner
id
have
this
again
gladly
as
i
found
it
to
be
quite
flavorful
but
smoked
in
a
mellow
understated
but
balanced
way

and
a
faint
aroma
of
prunes
mouthfeel
was
watery
with
a
light
effervescence
forming
the
backdrop
easy
drinking
and
interesting
but
not
a
beer
i
would
seek
out
pours
with
a

that
fades
slowly
to
a
thin
layer
leaving
some
lace
cloudy

carbonation
and

bodied
faint
smokey
nose
flavor
is
has
some

and
malty

just
maybe
a

smoke
but
not

idea
of
a
rauchbier

for
a
500ml
bottle
from
a

wine
wells
me
d
this
is
a
very
easy
drinker
although
i
typically
like
more
smoke
character
out
of
a
beer
i
feel
like
i
could
have
a
few
of
these
whereas
one
is
usually
enough
with
other
smoked
beers
d
decent
enough
but
ill
buy
aecht
schlenkerla
many
times
before
i
buy
this

a

gold
with
a
short

lovely

and

aroma
too
bad
it
turns
out
to
be
false
advertising
taste
is
very
lagery
lots
of
saaz
and
sweet
malt
but
only
a
subtle
smoked
finish
i
want
more
out
of
my
smoked
beer
this
is
like
a
czechvar
with
a
drop
of
liquid
smoke
md
refreshing
enough
clean
lightbodied
and
delicious
for
a
lightweight
smoked
bier
nothing
like
schlenkerla
märzen
but
this
is
a
delicately
smoked
amber
bier
with
a
decent
level
of
bittersweetness
as
a
lovely
balancer
very
drinkable
i
had
this
several
times
ontap
at
the
spezial
brewery
in
bamberg
which
is
nearly
100
years
older
than
aecht
schlenkerla
rauchbier
and
is
located
just
across
the
bridge
it
has
a
reddish
color
with
a
head
equal
to
that
of
schlenkerla
but
a
much
more
subdued
smell
which
is
indicative
of
the
taste
its
very
easy
to
drink
and
the
typical
rauchbier
taste
is
only
noticed
after
taking
a
swig
not
during
spezial
definitely
doesnt
have
the
same
impact
as
schlenkerla
but
it
certainly
is
a
beer
worth
drinking
if
you
want
to
drink
a
much
easier
rauchbier
the
brewery
though
certainly
has
the
best
beer
keller
around
with
fantastic
views
of
the
bamberg
cathedral
and
town
dont
expect
the
intensity
of
schlenkerla
expect
a
lovely
beer
with
a
pyrotechnic
hint
i
am
finding
it
easy
enough
to
drink
and
id
not
turn
down
another
if
it
was
free
i
think
ill
drop
my
dime
elsewhere
next
time
this
ones
on
the
shelf
though
i
might
finish
the
bottle
but
overall
this
was
odd
enough
and
it
fell
short
on
smoke
maybe
a
session
with
smokey
the
bear
or
a
retreat
to
the
tennessee
smokies
could
inspire
the
brewers
to
get
more
smoke
flavor
into
this
beer
the
taste
though
has
a
clear
but
very
ight
smokiness
that
primarily
developes
the
overall
character
rather
than
dominating
it
it
has
a
smokytoasted
grain
character
a
hint
of
dark
chocolate
caramel
dried
fruit
yeasty
bread
and
mineral
water
there
is
a
light
burnt
bitterness
that
becomes
stronger
in
the
finish
almost
too
strong
for
the
rather
thin
flavour
and
feel
bottom
line
i
need
to
revisit
this
brew
with
a
fresher
sample
as
is
its
not
bad
tasting
and
is
easy
to
drink
but
if
this
is
as
old
as
im
guessing
it
is
it
should
not
have
been
on
the
shelf
found
this
bottle
id
never
seen
before
at
city
market
so
into
my
pint
glass
it
went
good
head
retention
that
leaves
curtains
of
tiny
tanbubbled
lacing
the
aroma
was
dominated
by
toasted
malt
and
peat
smoke
with
some
hints
of
hops
hidden
beneath
the
flavors
were
at
first
toasted
malt
and
dry
grain
with
a
little
hop
bitterness
in
the
middle
quickly
followed
by
the
finish
which
is
all
peat
smoke
the
mouthfeel
was
a
little
rough
and
the
body
medium
not
a
bad
beer
and
a
good
example
of
the
style
but
you
have
to
love
the
peat
smoke
flavor
to
really
dig
it
d
this
is
a
very
pleasant
rauchbier
while
it
might
not
be
my
favorite
smoked
beer
its
very
sessionable
and
tasty
d
overall
a
good
beer
just
lacking
in
malt
quality
to
make
it
stand
out
per
style
pours
a
hazy
amber
with
zero
head
smell
is
rather
like
cider
taste
is
slight
malt
upfront
with
a
woody
smoky
middle
the
finish
is
slightly
grassy
also
has
an
oxidized
cidery
component
as
well
mouthfeel
is
pretty
good
carbonation
levels
nice
and
low
a
pretty
drinkable
beer
i
wonder
though
if
the
trip
has
aged
it
a
bit
more
than
it
should
though
this
really
shines
in
the
drinkability
department
perfect
for
any
barbecue
meal
just
the
right
amount
of
smoke
bottle
poured
a
clean
light
brown
color
ale
with
a
oneinch
foamy
head
with
good
retention
and
some
lacing
aroma
of
smoke
is
not
as
present
as
i
would
have
expected
taste
is
a
mix
between
a
light
caramel
malt
bills
with
some
medium
smoke
average
body
with
some
good
carbonation
easily
quaffable
but
not
as
much
character
as
i
would
have
expected
d
im
not
so
familiar
with
the
rauchbier
style
but
this
was
an
ok
beer
it
didnt
blow
me
away
but
still
pretty
well
done
this
doesnt
have
the
power
that
other
examples
of
the
style
have
schlenkerla
in
particular
but
the
subtlety
of
it
and
the
smoothness
makes
this
far
more
drinkable
even
sessionable
than
typical
try
it
with
lighter
smoked
food
a
burger
perhaps
heavy
smoked
foods
might
overshadow
it
poured
from
bottle
into
a
mug
this
beer
had
a
nice
rich
caramel
color
to
it
lacing
was
minimal
and
head
retention
was
quick
in
the
mouth
this
beer
is
a
nice
medium
bodied
lager
with
a
slight
sweetness
of
malt
followed
by
a
subtle
smokiness
finishing
with
more
maltiness
carbonation
is
very
well
balanced
lower
alcohol
level
makes
this
beer
perfect
as
a
session
beer
excellent
beer
for
grilled
foods
nuts
and
cheeses
this
beer
went
down
fast
while
the
aecht
schlenkerla
rauchbier
marzen
will
always
be
my
favorite
german
beer
spezial
puts
up
a
great
fight
medium
dark
amber
color
with
a
smokey
sweet
honey
after
taste
this
lager
as
the
label
claims
is
refreshing
especially
after
a
hot
day
at
work
it
has
a
lasting
flavor
i
that
i
never
get
from
lagers
i
also
dont
drink
many
so
i
cant
boast
perfect
for
bbqs
to
drink
and
for
marinades
why
the
hell
not
i
have
only
been
able
to
find
the
bigger
bottles
at
bevmo
and
once
at
toronado
i
hope
to
see
more
of
this
im
not
a
huge
fan
of
lagers
but
this
baby
only
at
4
6
will
keep
me
coming
back
very
subtle
smoky
flavors
and
not
in
your
face
like
other
examples
of
the
style
other
rauchbiers
can
go
overboard
and
it
ends
up
smelling
and
tasting
like
a
campfire
but
this
was
well
done
and
very
drinkable
had
during
a
memorable
session
with
my
wife
at
the
dundee
dell
in
omaha
ne
poured
into
a
fat
goblet
it
produced
a
thick
head
that
lasted
forever
and
emitted
a
glorious
scent
of
leather
and
smoke
color
was
a
hazy
brown
allowing
some
light
to
pass
through
but
not
much
there
was
very
little
fizz
and
it
had
a
lot
of
thickness
in
the
body
that
made
it
feel
heavy
when
in
the
mouth
but
had
a
very
smooth
overall
texture
it
lacked
the
hammy
ultrasmoky
violence
of
aecht
schlenkerla
my
alltime
favorite
rauchbier
but
held
a
sublime
charm
very
much
worth
a
try
dont
drink
it
very
cold
not
the
best
depiction
of
the
style
yet
more
subdued
and
light
drinkability
easily
drinkable
perhaps
the
easiest
of
any
rauchbier
ive
ever
had
restrained
smokiness
makes
it
a
good
introductory
beer
for
rauchbier
beginners
perhaps
the
quintessence
of
style
and
subtlety
not
bad
at
all
d
fairly
drinkable
would
have
again
sometime
this
would
pair
nicely
with
some
bbq
or
good
cheese
d
much
more
drinkable
than
other
rauchbiers
reminds
me
of
the
times
i
pent
int
the
spezial
brewery
in
bamberg
pours
a
slightly
cloudy
light
coppergold
with
a
thin
white
head
which
dissipates
a
bit
quickly
leaving
little
lacing
in
my
stange
not
a
strong
smell
some
crystal
and
munich
malts
not
much
smoke
or
hops
kinda
smells
more
like
a
marzen
a
crisp
malty
flavor
def
backed
up
by
smoke
more
munich
malt
here
a
touch
of
noble
hops
somewhere
in
there
as
well
a
bit
thin
but
well
carbonated
keeps
it
a
little
creamier
not
a
bad
rauch
at
all
subtly
smokey
and
very
drinkable
d
drinkability
remains
good
throughout
this
beer
any
trace
of
alcohol
is
hard
to
pick
out
body
is
light
flavor
has
a
good
balance
these
are
qualities
of
a
beer
that
is
quite
drinkable
had
this
on
tap
at
the
moan
and
dove
really
wicked
good
dark
amber
appearance
with
a
slowly
thinned
head
the
smell
was
the
key
it
was
a
little
hard
to
discern
at
first
yes
it
definitely
had
a
smoked
texture
to
it
but
the
real
flavors
of
both
malt
and
grain
were
deliciously
discovered
through
the
nostrils
those
same
flavors
were
bittersweetly
shown
in
the
taste
of
the
beverage
a
pretty
good
medium
body
saved
it
from
being
too
watery
overall
this
is
definitely
a
drink
to
check
out
d
i
liked
the
modesty
of
the
smoke
in
this
it
allowed
other
flavors
sugar
tart
to
matter
more
not
one
id
have
too
often
it
is
a
quirky
style
but
one
id
have
again
and
would
recommend
dark
copper
color
with
a
weak
lace
top
and
minimal
ring
some
unexpected
aromas
of
apple
juice
brown
sugar
and
a
faint
earthy
malt
this
rauch
exhibits
some
fruitiness
to
start
melon
apple
mixed
with
tea
raw
barley
grainy
cereal
nutty
and
a
mild
caramel
flavor
the
smokey
character
is
subdued
but
picks
up
ground
towards
the
finish
and
is
bigger
in
the
aftertaste
which
for
me
is
just
fine
as
i
am
not
a
rauch
fan
enjoyable
mouthfeel
with
a
light
creaminess
to
the
carbonation
spezial
rauch
makes
a
good
gateway
rauch
but
i
appreciate
its
subtleness
and
it
ends
up
being
pretty
drinkable
i
have
not
tried
any
other
rauchbier
styles
from
this
brewers
to
compare
with
but
this
was
pretty
good
cant
say
i
wont
ever
get
it
again
but
i
will
probably
pick
up
the
marzen
or
urzbock
next
time
i
reach
for
this
brewery
pours
with
a
thick
head
that
dissipates
to
a
thin
one
rather
quickly
is
a
light
smokey
amber
in
color
the
aroma
is
heavy
in
grain
with
strong
smokey
surprise
overtones
flavor
is
light
with
smoke
grains
dominating
it
leaves
me
desiring
something
a
bit
thicker
and
heavier
to
accompany
the
smoke
spezial

lager
pours
a
slightly
hazy
orangecopper
color
with
a
thick
white
head
from
a
brown
twenty
five
ounce
bottle
there
is
a
mild
malty
sweetness
and
a
subdued
smoke
character
in
the
aroma
the
flavor
starts
off
with
a
sweet
maltiness
and
then
the
smoke
flavor
comes
in
this
is
relatively
mild
on
the
smoke
flavor
compared
to
others
ive
tried
nicely
balanced
and
quite
enjoyable
pours
a
nice
goldorange
color
with
a
small
but
tight
head
that
leaves
huge
lace
all
the
way
down
the
glass
it
is
a
little
hazy
aroma
is
softly
smoky
grainy
and
toasty
very
nice
and
sweet
flavor
is
grainy
and
smoky
malty
sweet
with
a
very
restrained
noble
hop
smoke
comes
through
the
most
in
a
soft
aftertaste
very
pleasant
beer
with
a
great
but
restrained
smoke
character
initially
excellent
it
seems
to
get
a
little
watery
and
thin
as
i
get
past
the
halfway
point
in
my
glass
still
quite
a
tasty
and
smokey
brew
looking
forward
to
trying
it
again
when
it
gets
warm
enough
to
fire
up
the
charcoal
grill
pours
a
pretty
reddish
amber
hue
with
absolutely
no
head
i
got
this
as
part
of
a
trader
and
it
has
a
bottled
on
date
of
2904
6
days
after
i
turned
21
so
its
been
legal
as
long
as
i
have
without
a
doubt
the
oldest
beer
ive
ever
had
scent
is
very
strong
a
very
unique
biscuit
maltiness
to
it
has
a
smokey
essence
to
it
as
well
taste
is
very
watery
taste
is
bland
maybe
its
the
age
of
this
beer
but
it
didnt
age
very
well
it
isnt
bad
per
say
but
it
isnt
good
either
is
just
a
lack
thereof
started
off
really
good
but
kind
of
fell
off
probably
just
the
aging
as
far
as
i
know
lagers
dont
age
that
well
but
i
could
be
wrong
d
very
drinkable
beer
although
not
remarkable
there
are
better
rauchs
to
start
out
with
pours
a
practically
clear
amber
gold
with
an
off
white
head
slight
smoke
on
the
nose
and
a
bit
of
hops
very
mild
on
the
flavor
and
not
very
much
smoke
there
to
speak
of
at
first
but
as
it
warmed
up
those
smoke
characteristics
peeked
out
if
i
did
a
blind
tasting
of
this
as
it
was
when
i
first
drank
it
i
am
not
sure
if
i
would
know
this
is
a
rauchbier
feel
is
standard
a
bit
like
a
macro
lager
nothing
much
going
on
here
this
is
my
second
dance
with
this
style
and
the
first
was
much
more
impressionable
its
drinkable
yes
but
for
the
money
and
lack
of
flair
in
flavor
why
overall
recommended
for
a
try
if
you
like
the
style
i
would
be
interested
in
trying
some
of
the
brewerys
other
offerings
pours
a
nice
amber
color
with
a
decent
amount
of
head
aroma
is
nice
and
smoky
and
not
too
overpowering
in
that
department
sweet
as
well
taste
is
light
and
smoky
with
the
clean
lines
of
a
lager
showing
through
aftertaste
is
decent
and
the
beer
goes
down
really
smooth
a
nice
and
drinkable
good
quality
rauchbier
from
spezial
clean
crisp
flavors
actually
go
surprisingly
well
with
the
mild
smokiness
give
it
a
try
if
you
see
it
d
a
very
unique
an
idiosyncratic
beer
the
way
they
were
made
in
the
old
days
in
south
germany
i
think
this
is
a
style
of
beer
that
you
either
like
or
you
dont
i
do
and
i
think
it
is
a
beer
and
a
style
of
beer
that
would
go
great
with
a
bbq
in
the
summertime
drank
too
slow
because
of
the
cloying
sweetness
dont
recall
this
being
that
sweet
in
bamberg
perhaps
an
old
bottle
overall
this
was
a
nice
little
brew
for
sure
i
am
not
so
sure
that
i
would
go
out
and
get
more
of
it
or
not
as
there
are
soo
many
others
i
am
waiting
to
try
however
for
just
an
all
around
good
expierence
this
was
nice
if
it
was
offered
i
would
not
turn
it
away
and
would
love
to
expierence
it
on
tap
as
fresh
this
might
be
very
good
indeed
a
would
say
it
was
a
good
call
to
try
it
if
you
see
but
no
need
to
seek
it
out
at
all
costs
drinkability
very
drinkable
of
all
the
rauchbiers
i
have
had
i
would
say
that
this
one
is
one
of
the
most
drinkable
in
the
bunch
and
at
5
that
could
easily
be
very
drinkable
for
a
session
it
had
a
very
average
taste
to
it
almost
like
a
light
lager
i
tasted
very
little
smokiness
which
is
what
the
ruachbier
style
is
know
for
i
had
it
at
the
waterfront
ale
house
in
brooklyn
which
is
known
for
a
good
selection
of
beers
not
worth
what
is
paid
to
have
it
imported
it
did
also
have
a
sweeter
malt
than
expected
i
had
this
on
tap
at
the
old
forge
restaurant
in
massachusetts
it
was
presented
in
a
goblet
and
had
a
clear
amber
brown
color
with
a
wisp
of
a
head
the
aroma
was
malty
and
smoky
but
not
as
aggressive
as
i
expected
for
an
authentic
german
rauchbier
a
little
less
of
a
campfire
smell
than
ive
seen
from
several
others
the
taste
was
also
a
little
more
neutral
than
other
rauchbiers
but
definitely
had
some
smoky
flavor
in
it
in
my
opinion
this
is
a
good
gateway
rauchbier
to
bring
someone
into
the
fold
16
9oz
bottle
pours
a
brownish
amber
color
with
a
nice
white
head
the
aroma
smells
like
smoked
meats
the
taste
is
a
little
more
subdued
than
i
was
expecting
but
it
features
some
of
the
delicious
smoky
flavors
that
are
present
in
the
aroma
overall
this
is
a
highly
drinkable
and
enjoyable
rauchbier
that
is
recommended
in
fact
this
is
actually
a
pretty
good
beer
for
those
who
are
looking
to
ease
into
the
enjoyable
world
of
smoked
beers
interesting
if
drank
quite
warm
a
lot
warmer
than
i
like
and
in
my
opinion
lacking
a
bit
of
character
when
i
want
a
rauchbier
i
like
it
heavily
smoked
but
that
is
just
me

but
otherwise
nothing
special
above
average

had
this
on
tap
at
brauerei
spezial
in
bamberg
on
an
especially
rainy
day
a
lovely
dark
looking
lager
colour
in
the
glass
smoked
flavour
is
more
prominent
in
the
smell
than
in
the
taste
very
drinkable
beer
is
very
smooth
rather
like
a
helles
its
a
better
bet
to
try
this
rauch
beer
first
as
its
a
good
introduction
to
the
style
without
being
overpowered
with
smoke
a
nice
easy
to
drink
beer
it
didnt
blow
me
away
and
perhaps
it
could
even
be
a
little
smokier
richer
deeper
and
still
be
easy
on
the
buds
easily
the
lightest
rauchbier
ive
had
which
is
not
a
bad
thing
this
would
pair
nicely
with
some
very
mild
cheese
some
onion
soup
a
toasted
deli
beef
sandwich
or
some
mild
sausage
nothing
spectacular
but
a
nice
easy
to
drink
beer
that
could
be
a
great
transitional
rauchbier
for
those
looking
to
ease
into
the
genre
id
drink
it
again
but
wouldnt
be
opposed
to
trying
something
else
as
well
give
it
a
shot
doverall
a
good
beer
but
needs
more
smoke
still
this
is
a
refreshing
change
of
pace
was
able
to
give
this
brew
a
try
on
tap
and
i
must
say
what
a
delight
as
i
am
a
big
fan
of
rauchbier
but
rarely
get
them
and
even
more
rare
to
see
them
on
tap
was
presented
with
an
amber
color
with
orange
highlights
had
a
good
sized
slightly
off
hedging
to
tan
white
head
that
had
nice
retention
and
left
a
good
amount
of
lacing
down
the
side
of
the
glass
the
aroma
is
very
pleasant
as
the
smokiness
shows
through
along
with
what
i
perceive
as
a
nice
malt
scent
the
taste
is
really
where
the
smokiness
comes
out
seems
to
have
the
flavors
that
would
go
along
with
smoked
meats
minus
the
meats
kind
of
like
a
smoker
before
food
is
added
i
know
that
there
are
other
beers
out
there
that
have
a
more
smoke
filled
profile
but
i
think
that
this
one
has
the
balance
that
is
needed
for
this
type
of
brew
besides
the
smoke
flavors
i
am
able
to
pick
up
the
malts
that
seem
to
give
a
sweet
taste
while
having
a
nice
dry
finish
overall
this
is
a
very
easy
drinking
brew
this
would
easily
be
a
great
session
brew
in
my
book
if
you
like
this
type
i
got
a
10oz
of
this
at
mahars
because
i
am
always
a
bit
wary
of
rauchbiers
i
wish
i
had
gotten
a
bigger
one
in
retrospect
it
pours
a
light
amber
with
a
one
finger
white
head
the
aroma
was
very
malty
with
a
good
biscuit
quality
and
a
hint
of
zoo
funk
in
there
the
flavor
is
very
malty
with
a
good
but
not
overpowering
smoke
character
it
reminds
me
of
a
roasted
pig
somewhat
there
are
some
caramel
notes
as
well
the
body
was
light
to
medium
overall
one
of
the
better
smoked
beers
ive
had
mostly
clear
deep
golden
copper
body
with
a
few
flecks
of
yeast
i
tried
to
keep
them
out
foamy
inch
or
so

edge
taste
starts
out
smoky
and
good
bready
malts
fillin
under
a
smoky
haze
again
reminds
me
of
a
wet
campfire
light
sweetness
detectable
like
a
honey
glaze
on
a
smoked
ham
moderate
hop
bitterness
in
the
mostly
sweet
smoky
finish
nice
moderate
body
with
a
slightly
soapy
feel
would
love
to
see
more
examples
of
this
style
im
developing
a
thing
for
rauchbiers
taste
is
crisp
and
surprisingly
clean
in
body
the
smoke
is
even
and
less
meat
oriented
than
other
rauchs
ive
sampled
aftertaste
has
more
earthy
peaty
wood
tones
as
well
texture
is
surprisingly
light
and
easy
to
drink
if
such
a
thing
as
a
sessionable
rauch
exists
this
may
be
it
stubby
cocoa
colored
head
left
specs
of
lace
all
over
the
glass
glowing
chestnut
colored
beer
smells
like
a
mix
of
caramel
malt
and
musty
leather
flavors
of
tea
leather
beef
jerky
and
caramel
malt
blend
together
nicely
the
body
is
on
the
light
side
of
full
and
there
is
just
the
right
amount
of
carbonation
a
nice
well
balanced
smoked
beer
drinkability
this
was
my
first
rauchbier
and
it
definitely
is
a
particular
taste
this
doesnt
really
seem
like
my
type
of
beer
but
i
plan
on
trying
some
more
at
some
point
16
9oz
bottle
has
some
sort
of
numbers
for
bottling
date
info
but
it
made
no
sense
oh
well
they
tried
pours
dark
dull
honey
cloudy
and
lowish
carbonation
after
initially
being
fairly
active
tan
head
quickly
goes
bye
bye
musty
slightly
sweet
and
smokey
nose
this
is
a
pretty
middle
of
the
road
little
smoke
beer
smoke
notes
quite
moderate
some
orangy
sweetness
continues
to
flow
across
the
palate
nothing
special
but
this
would
do
in
a
pinch
for
a
summer
bbq
easily
drinkable
although
not
what
i
would
really
expect
from
a
rauchbier
pretty
much
just
a
solid
tasty
lager
id
recommend
giving
it
a
try
but
not
if
youre
looking
for
a
bold
smokiness
no
where
near
the
kick
the
aecht
schlenkerla
beers
but
still
very
nice
a
session
rauch
that
very
much
embodies
the
lager
as
much
as
the
smoke
i
like
it
d
the
lager
is
easy
to
drink
it
just
wont
shake
you
to
the
core
d
decently
drinkable
but
not
the
best
or
most
unique

havent

yet
poured
a
light
orange
color
only
the
slightest
hint
of
cloudiness
small
head
when
i
stuck
my
nose
in
it
the
smoke
and
sausage
hit
it
right
away
and
they
continue
to
dominate
this
is
my
first
smoked
beer
and
im
impressed
with
how
spoton
these
smells
are
you
can
smell
the
spice
in
the
sausage
the
taste
continues
with
the
smokesausage
dominating
but
its
overall
lighter
than
expected
not
as
heavy
as
you
would
think
of
something
described
as
smoked
very
clean
the
mouthfeel
too
is
surprising
light
even
a
tad
watery
for
my
taste
overall
an
easy
to
drink
beer
unique
flavors
although
this
style
is
definitely
not
my
favorite
drinkability
very
easily
quaffable
nice
taste
and
something
a
little
different
overall
a
nice
rendition
of
the
style
very
easy
drinking
i
could
easily
have
gone
for
another
more
of
a
session
beer
version
of
a
rauchbier
unlike
its
more
robust
counterparts
from
the
schlenkerla
lineup
a
good
one
to
introduce
newbies
to
the
style
drinkability
was
nice
and
easy
it
went
down
really
well
i
liked
it
a
lot
if
it
were
not
for
the
cost
this
would
be
a
good
session
beer
as
it
is
i
can
see
downing
a
couple
with
a
few
brats
much
better
american
craft
smoked
beers
readily
available
better
tasting
and
more
economical
it
would
be
great
to
try
this
fresh
in
bamberg
surprisingly
easy
to
drink
is
what
this
is
it
is
almost
difficult
not
to
guzzle
it
down
pleasantly
dry
this
would
compliment
grilled
and
smoked
grub
famously
i
could
see
this
as
being
a
summer
staple
brew
taste
is
also
smoky
and
meaty
pork
again
this
is
way
porky
seriously
cant
say
that
enough
earthy
too
nose
is
stronger
in
the
meaty
and
smokyness
though
some
light
toffee
flavors
come
through
as
well
as
some
breadygrainyness
a
lightly
smoky
aftertaste
mouthfeel
is
sudsy
but
on
the
lighter
side
wish
it
had
a
bit
more
body
overall
a
tasty
unique
beer
excuse
me
i
have
to
go
bbq
now
high
marks
for
drinkability
but
i
prefer
a
bigger
brew
with
more
smoke
cheers
rereview
72509this
time
pours
out
to
a
limpid
mildly
carbonated
dark
tan
with
not
much
smoke
in
the
nose
actually
quick
a
bit
more
malt
like
a
bock
or
dopplebock
with
suggestions
of
raisins
and
prunes
mouthfeel
is
still
somewhat
thin
for
the
style
and
smoke

there

mild
still
pretty
good

i
wonder
if
i
dont
have
a
fresh

smoke
and
slightly
grainy
viennamunic
malts
is
most
inviting
flavors
evolve
as
the
palate
becomes
anestised
to
the
smoked
malt
faint
sweetness
from
c40
or
a
lighter
crystal
malt
but
not
enough
to
require
bitterness
for
drying
body
medium
light
but
with
help
of
the
fine
carbonation
fill
the
mouth
giving
a
rich
nutty
middle
that
is
easy
to
hold
on
to
a
nobel
hop
tries
to
outlast
the
smoke
in
the
finish
a
good
introduction
to
rauchbier
that
is
well
done
but
more
restrained
than
aecht
schlenkerla
rauchbier
marzen
the
smoke
flavor
is
exclusively
up
front
and
out
back
in
the
middle
its
all
malt
and
hops
mouthfeel
drinkability
the
beer
is
light
bodied
the
beer
is

this
is

after

i
want
more
smokiness
the

got

enough
to
let

lets
a
very

shine
through

not
a

that
brings
about
the
images
of
jerkey
or
chops
but
i
think
it
makes
it
more
drinkable
this
could
be
a
session
rauchbier
whereas
others
are
only
something
i
can
do
a

at

theres
a

to

with
a

smokiness
toasted
malt
flavor
with
noticable
smokiness

is
balanced
by
the
smokiness
theres
a
little

of
apple

flavor
crisp
mouthfeel
alcohol
is
not
noticable
this
beer
has
a
great
drinkability
its
a
great
choice
either
paired
with
a
meal
or
on
its
own
this
is
the
first
smokedrauchbier
that
ive
tried
so
unfortunately
i
havent
tried
any
other
beers
in
the
style
to
compare
it
to
overall
i
think
that
its
good
and
id
definitely
try
it
again
ive
had
smoked
beers
before
but
always
as
a
darker
fuller
beer
so
the
smoke
flavor
is
not
the
only
thing
you
can
taste
with
this
weaker
beer
the
smoke
flavor
is
just
a
bit
too
much
not
worth
persuing
but
a
tasty
lager
for
sure
the
actual
body
and
make
up
of
the
beer
is
near
excellent
but
as
a
rauch
it
just
doesnt
deliver
ill
revisit
it
at
some
time
to
see
if
it
was
just
a
bad
bottle
this
is
definitely
the
most
drinkable
rauchbier
ive
ever
had
i
feel
like
i
could
drink
it
all
night
and
if
i
had
a
couple
more
i
just
might
d
very
very
drinkable
taste
the
beer
tastes
like
bacon
with
a
slight
hint
of
sweetness
to
balance
there
is
very
little
hops
going
on
in
this
brew
as
far
as
the
mouth
feel
this
beer
feel
good
in
the
mouth
and
leaves
your
mouth
a
little
dry
perhaps
as
a
result
of
some
tannins
that
were
extracted
from
the
dark
smoked
grains
used
in
this
beer
over
all
a
good
brew
id
love
to
have
this
stuff
fresh
in
the
bamberg
drinkability
and
overall
a
very
nice
example
of
a
rauchbier
although
it
lacks
robustness
very
easy
drinking
though
and
defeinitly
one
id
like
to
have
again
as
other
reviews
have
noted
this
beer
is
a
bit
lacking
in
being
well
smoky
other
rauchbiers
ive
sampled
have
much
more
of
a
smokymeaty
smell
and
flavor
to
them
however
this
is
the
only
bottled
rauchbier
ive
ever
ran
across
here
in
lincoln
paired
correctly
this
would
make
a
great
dining
beer
this
might
be
too
toned
down
i
might
have
to
try
a
more
intense
rauchbier
before
deciding
if
i
like
this
style
this
is
rather
enjoyable
not
the
most
exuberant
of
the
bamberg
rauchbiers
ive
had
but
that
may
be
due
in
fact
to
freshness
yet
another
reason
to
return
to
one
of
the
most
unique
beerproducing
cities
on
the
planet
finishes
dry
and
slightly
bitter
not
as
smoky
as
i
expected
smoky
sweet
malt
is
the
profile
and
the
beer
itself
is
refreshing
mouthfeel
is
good
low
carbonation
very
drinkable
maybe
not
smoky
enough
for
some
drinkability
overall
this
made
for
a
very
nice
light
beer
that
could
be
used
for
a
rauchbier
session
beer
maybe
not
the
best
rauchbier
but
a
good
one
none
the
less
this
rauchbier
pours
a
mostly
clear
amber
with
little
active
carbonation
and
no
head
to
speak
of
there
is
some
floating
sediment
throughout
the
glass
the
smell
is
nutty
and
of
smoked
wood
with
some
some
faint
hops
coming
though
also
the
taste
is
much
of
the
same
smokey
with
a
light
caramelly
sweetness
the
finish
is
not
as
bitter
as
i
would
have
expected
the
smoke
flavor
dominates
this
one
as
the
malt
and
hop
flavors
dont
come
out
very
strong
the
mouthfell
is
thin
and
the
lower
carbonation
makes
it
taste
a
bit
watered
down
not
bad
if
you
prefer
smokier
beers
but
it
could
use
a
better
presentation
and
more
robust
flavor
d
very
good
beer
to
have
on
a
wet
cold
night
such
as
this
one
reminds
me
of
living
up
in
the
mountains
and
having
the
fireplace
around
cant
argue
with
that
spezial
rauchbier
lager
is
good
beer
if
you
like
smoke
youll
probably
enjoy
it
if
you
dont
you
probably
wont
hows
that
for
a
brilliant
analysis
i
like
it
just
fine
even
though
i
dont
crave
rauchbiers
very
often
i
plan
to
buy
this
one
whenever
i
happen
to
run
across
it
the
light
body
and
moderate
smoke
flavors
make
for
a
rauch
less
interesting
then
some
of
the
schlenkerla
but
this
could
make
for
a
better
dinner
beer
lightmedium
bodied
fairly
easy
to
drink
should
work
well
with
barbecue
or
wild
game
thanks
to
putnam
for
letting
me
know
about
this
one
pours
out
to
a
orange
copper
color
with
a
head
of
about
18
inch
minor
notes
of
lacing
and
a
medium
level
of
carbonation
aroma
is
quite
good
but
doesnt
quite
stack
up
to
the
power
and
intensity
of
aecht
schlenkerlas
urbock
or
marzen
this
is
very
much
a
lager
and
rauchbier
not
one
or
the
other
smells
like
bacon
smoke
and
cured
ham
nice
but
couldve
been
a
bit
stronger
taste
is
similar
to
the
aroma
but
with
some
lager
characteristics
mixed
in
for
good
measure
smoke
spice
applewood
malts
and
some
light
hops
toward
the
finish
blend
rather
well
mouthfeel
is
medium
bodied
and
slightly
smooth
good
drinkability
i
could
have
this
everyday
unlike
aecht
schlenkerla
urbock
or
marzen
probably
a
good
starting
point
for
those
looking
to
try
the
rauchbier
style
recommended
m
crisp
finish
smoothed
out
by
the
lingering
smoke
not
an
everyday
beer
but
very
drinkable
on
occasion
intersting
bamberg
brew
not
nearly
as
assertively
smoky
as
schlenklera
products
but
tasty
and
refreshing
light
bodied
with
definite
malt
and
fruity
yeast
in
the
palate
as
well
you
can
taste
the
hops
at
thetail
end
as
well
to
be
honest
i
was
anticipating
more
smoke
and
consequently
was
disappointed
but
it
was
tasty
just
not
as
tasty
as
the
others
poured
into
a
mug
a
hazy
tarnished
brass
foam
starts
rocky
and
drops
to
a
ring
smell
is
a
mellow
smoked
sausage
making
the
saliva
glands
work
in
anticipation
of
the
savory
flavor
the
taste
is
light
lagerish
with
heavy
smoke
throughout
malts
are
subdued
and
a
low
hop
presence
makes
itself
known
mouthfeel
is
rather
light
but
the
flavor
makes
up
for
any
lack
of
character
here
this
beer
disappears
rather
quickly
if
you
like
smoke
ales
then
this
lager
based
version
is
worth
a
try
the
beer
pours
a
dark
goldorange
color
with
a
thick
frothy
offwhite
head
that
slowly
fades
to
lacing
the
aroma
is
decent
it
has
a
typical
lager
scent
with
a
slight
light
crystal
malt
and
smokey
aroma
the
smoke
is
light
but
noticable
the
taste
is
good
it
has
a
smooth
lager
taste
with
an
earthy
smokiness
in
the
finish
it
goes
down
easy
and
finishes
dry
and
musty
the
mouthfeel
is
decent
it
is
a
low
bodied
beer
with
a
little
too
much
carbonation
this
is
a
decent
beer
it
has
good
taste
but
it
lacks
mouthfeel
all
in
all
it
still
drinks
well
but
i
wouldnt
buy
it
again
dn
my
first
rauchbier
thanks
to
the
manager
at
sharp
edge
for
pointing
my
towards
this
one
its
a
different
sort
of
beer
than
im
usually
drinking
and
quite
a
pleasant
diversion
i
was
worried
that
a
smoked
beer
would
be
like
drinking
another
skullsplitter
so
i
was
very
wary
of
this
one
but
happily
this
one
isnt
like
sucking
on
an
ashtray
worth
a
try
bottled
02092004
honey
gold
and
semi
unclear
can
see
sediment
throughout
it
just
the
slightest
bit
of
a
white
ring
of
dusty
head
only
a
touch
of
liquid
smoke
in
the
scent
but
not
much
else
did
catch
an
almost
honey
scent
as
it
warmed
fairly
thin
bodied
with
a
bit
of
carbonation
not
too
much
not
as
smokey
as
the
other
rauchs
i
have
tried
before
but
there
is
a
decent
amount
of
liquid
smoke
in
the
background
it
just
is
not
too
intense
in
the
flavors
the
smoke
seems
to
be
more
in
the
aroma
and
lingers
in
your
mouth
after
the
sip
you
smell
it
on
your
breath
heavily
too
seems
funny
to
say
the
aroma
lingers
on
your
mouth
mild
flavors
mainly
just
malty
with
a
touch
of
smoke
and
a
bit
of
darkened
toast
left
in
the
back
of
the
mouth
interesting
one
to
try
hmmm
interesting
glad
i
tried
this
but
i
dont
think
ill
be
going
back
to
it
its
just
not
my
style
that
being
said
pours
a
fairly
average
looking
golden
color
with
some
white
bubbly
head
on
top
smell
is
fairly
nondescript
but
includes
notes
of
spicy
hops
dust
and
smokeyness
the
tasteaftertaste
is
way
too
smoky
for
me
i
realized
that
it
was
supposed
to
be
smoky
but
i
didnt
think
it
would
be
that
overpowering
i
enjoy
a
bit
of
the
subtle
smoke
flavor
of
some
porters
but
this
flavor
was
right
out
front
and
was
difficult
to
ignore
in
order
to
taste
the
rest
of
what
the
beer
had
to
offer
as
you
drink
this
beer
you
kind
of
get
used
to
the
smokiness
but
was
a
challenge
for
me
to
finish
a
whole
one
and
i
dont
think
ive
ever
said
that
in
a
review
before
try
this
one
at
your
own
risk
and
know
ahead
of
time
that
youre
in
for
something
weird
weird
isnt
necessarily
bad
but
i
didnt
like
this
beer
it
pours
an
amber
color
with
2
fingers
of
fizzy
lacey
white
head
very
clean
looking
aroma
is
quite
grainy
w
an
almost
lima
bean
aroma
yeah
really
but
not
much
aroma
at
all
and
it
reminded
me
almost
of
beef
vegetable
stew
and
i
hate
beef
vegetable
stew
taste
is
a
slight
smoke
flavor
w
a
hickory
meat
taste
almost
like
beef
jerky
some
grainy
malts
and
very
little
hops
overall
i
was
not
happy
feel
is
tingly
carbonation
on
the
sip
followed
by
a
thinning
feel
by
the
swallow
not
much
else
going
on
this
is
quite
possibly
the
worst
beer
i
have
ever
had
honestly
flavor
is
similar
to
nose
no
smoke
flavor
is
sweet
and
fruity
apples
pears
and
tangy
yeast
i
get
some
lemon
and
slightly
spicy
hops
but
again
no
smoke
dont
get
me
wrong
the
beer
is
quite
tasty
but
i
ordered
what
i
thought
was
a
smoke
beer
and
it
ended
up
tasting
like
a
dubbel
enjoyable
beer
but
my
marks
are
low
due
to
lack
of
smoke
a
dark
golden
amber
beer
has
a
very
small
white
head
that
dissappers
quickly
there
is
a
light
grainy
lager
aroma
with
some
malty
sweetness
in
the
background
and
maybe
a
hint
of
smoke
smokey
flavor
covers
you
tongue
quickly
with
a
light
fruity
sweetness
in
the
background
looks
a
bit
musty
brown
decent
carbonation
big
bubble
but
not
frothy
decent
smells
of
campfire
and
beer
in
that
order
this
is
my
first
bamburg
rauchbier
i
enjoy
the
smoke
but
would
prefer
not
to
drink
it
solo
better
paired
with
something
else
smoky
i
imagine
this
isnt
bad
but
im
not
head
over
heels
for
it
either
good
enough
to
try
and
maybe
like
i
may
even
find
myself
revisiting
it
someday
recommended
consumed
in
october
2004
at
the
toronado
on
tap
well
for
starters
this
apparently
isnt
my
type
of
beer
which
makes
it
really
hard
to
review
im
not
a
fan
of
smoked
beers
as
i
was
not
aware
that
this
type
of
beer
was
smoked
so
i
apologize
to
all
smoked
beer
lovers
for
the
low
rating
i
am
going
to
give
i
guess
its
just
one
of
those
aquired
taste
beers
just
like
i
love
ipa
to
the
max
beers
others
cant
tolerate
them
ok
poured
a
brownish
reddish
hazy
color
with
virtually
zero
head
whatever
it
left
next
to
no
lace
also
the
smell
was
a
bit
pungent
ive
always
read
the
reviews
of
barnyard
type
scents
and
never
understood
now
i
have
a
bit
of
an
understanding
ugh
didnt
enjoy
the
taste
at
all
mainly
because
of
the
smoky
overtones
next
to
zero
carbonation
and
tasted
like
a
pair
of
used
sweatsocks
that
have
been
soaking
in
some
aged
iced
tea
sorry
but
not
my
kind
of
beer
im
sure
its
a
perfectly
good
one
for
the
smoked
beer
fans
out
there
though
so
pay
no
attention
to
my
rating
unless
you
dislike
smoked
beers
like
i
do
ok
another
rauchbier
from
bamburg
umm
what
happened
did
they
lose
he
smoke
pours
a
nice
dark
amber
brown
with
a
host
of
floaty
things
smell
is
malty
but
oddly
not
smoky
taste
is
more
like
a
heavy
dunkle
lager
with
just
a
touch
of
smoke
this
beer
reminds
me
of
stones
smoked
porter
it
says
it
has
smoke
but
im
trying
to
find
it
some
one
give
me
a
cigarette
so
i
can
have
some
smoke
with
my
smoked
bier
its
a
tasty
brew
but
it
aint
that
smokey
i
love
the
aecht
schenkerla
rauchbiers
but
this
one
falls
so
short
of
them
its
not
even
funny
its
like
schlenkela
is
marlboro
and
this
bier
is
marlboro
ultra
lite
its
tasty
in
a
malty
almost
martzen
way
but
not
gonna
be
smokey
enough
for
rauch
lovers
this
brew
has
a
dark
ambercopper
body
with
a
tan
head
that
ran
away
from
me
slight
smokey
aroma
on
top
of
a
malty
lager
scent
kinda
reminds
me
of
a
dark
euro
lager
with
smoke
hints
slight
hop
flavor
nice
level
of
maltiness
med
to
light
mouth
not
as
intense
on
the
smoke
as
say
the
rogue
makes
this
beer
much
more
appealing
to
mainstream
beer
drinkers
i
would
think
wyll
tasters
may
compare
this
to
the
aecht
schlenkerla
rauchbier
beers
which
come
in
marzen
wheat
and
urbock
stylesstyles
also
brewed
by
spezial
the
lager
is
sweeter
has
less
alcohol
and
lessassertive
smokyness
the
roastyness
added
interest
poured
into
a
tall
pilsner
glass
from
the
25
oz
bottle
it
delivers
a
clear
deepambercopper
body
with
an
orangeish
glow
and
some
golden
highlights
at
the
base
of
the
glass
plumes
of
very
tiny
somewhat
effervescent
bubbles
stream
upwards
towards
its
creamy
ivory
head
the
head
retention
is
very
good
and
it
holds
well
and
leaves
some
nice
lace
about
the
glass
the
aroma
displays
a
distinct
but
nicely
restrained
beechwood
smoke
over
a
grainy
maltiness
very
nicely
done
there
are
some
examples
that
push
the
limits
and
there
are
some
that
hold
back
a
bit
too
much
but
like
the
finest
examples
of
the
style
this
one
is
right
on
the
body
is
medium
and
combines
with
a
very
finebubbled
median
carbonation
it
gives
a
lightly
crisp
and
then
smooth
mouthfeel
in
the
flavor
the
beechwood
smokiness
is
wrapped
within
a
blanket
of
distinctly
grainy
lightly
toffeeish
malt
its
very
well
balanced
between
the
two
and
backed
by
a
firm
bitterness
that
becomes
more
solid
at
the
swallow
leaving
it
to
finish
dry
with
some
rising
spicy
hops
and
just
a
mild
touch
of
lingering
smoke
although
some
tasters
might
believe
that
this
is
a
bit
restrained
for
the
style
thats
far
from
the
truth
not
all
bamberg
rauchbiers
are
as
bold
as
the
best
known
examples
and
in
fact
this
is
a
perfect
example
of
the
very
drinkable
and
balanced
dunkle
lager
that
you
might
find
at
a
tavern
hotel
or
keller
in
the
area
its
smokiness
does
not
build
on
the
palate
after
a
few
litres
and
it
retains
its
lightly
sweet
and
grainy
maltiness
very
nice
an
excellent
example
of
an
authentic
bambergstyle
rauchbier
thats
absolutely
worth
trying
pours
a
deep
copper
hue
that
is
a
bit
cloudy
and
has
about
and
inch
tall
white
head
the
head
dissolved
fairly
quickly
into
a
light
bubbly
cap
on
the
beer
with
almost
no
sign
of
lacing
there
is
definitely
a
smoky
scent
detectable
but
it
does
not
completely
dominate
the
aroma
some
malt
sweetness
stood
out
as
well
with
hints
of
spiciness
detected
the
taste
is
very
similar
to
the
smell
with
a
definite
smokiness
with
sweet
malt
and
a
slight
hoppiness
present
the
finish
was
dry
and
smoky
which
hung
around
in
the
mouth
for
a
while
this
has
a
good
medium
body
and
a
very
smooth
drinking
beer
this
was
my
first
experience
with
a
rauchbier
and
i
am
very
intrigued
by
the
style
it
has
a
great
unique
taste
and
would
defiantly
recommend
this
to
anyone
who
has
not
tried
the
style
not
as
complex
as
it
could
be
but
this
is
an
interesting
and
historical
style
that
i
really
enjoy
this
oozes
charcoaled
beechwood
malt
from
start
to
finish
very
pleasant
to
sip
clear
amber
in
hue
with
noticeable
highlights
of
copper
and
maybe
a
splash
of
bronze
a
foamy
white
head
of
a
half
finger
formed
but
failed
to
hold
long
it
quickly
faded
to
a
bubbly
collar
subsequent
lacing
never
transpired
honestly
i
was
expecting
a
darker
more
mysterious
looking
beer
i
like
surprises
the
smokiness
of
the
nose
was
obvious
but
light
the
aromatics
from
the
malts
displayed
a
soft
smoked
meatbeef
jerkycampfire
baked
beans
with
lots
of
bacon
characteristics
behind
these
smells
laid
a
suggestion
of
lager
airiness
maybe
a
hint
of
hops
too
the
potency
is
modest
the
invitation
is
clear
enough
lets
drink
upfront
on
the
palate
the
smoky
qualities
of
the
beer
are
found
cured
baconham
notes
a
beechwood
campfire
off
in
the
distant
and
a
hint
of
wet
wood
these
qualities
are
all
pleasant
none
of
them
are
loud
maybe
i
am
being
greedy
but
i
was
looking
for
more
still
no
complaints
in
the
middle
and
especially
at
the
finish
this
beer
nearly
sheds
its
smoky
start
and
becomes
a
lager
like
a
pils
or
a
smaller
helles
the
hops
really
slice
through
the
heavy
malty
qualities
that
seems
pils
like
but
there
is
also
a
faint
suggestion
of
noncured
malt
that
lends
itself
to
resemble
a
helles
the
main
point
is
the
smoky
flavors
fade
away
this
beer
would
work
wonders
with
many
meaty
bbq
dishes
the
start
of
the
beer
matches
the
flavors
of
firecooked
food
but
the
end
of
the
beer
is
crisp
enough
to
lift
away
the
residual
heft
this
allows
for
consumption
of
new
flavors
the
aftertaste
grows
more
hammy
and
smoky
tacky
too
in
the
mouthfeel
i
wonder
if
a
bit
more
carbonation
would
help
regardless
the
mouthfeel
is
good
this
is
plenty
drinkable
but
not
too
challenging
i
e
smoky
i
liked
it
im
glad
i
tried
it
i
now
know
what
to
expect
if
you
want
to
get
smokedout
skip
this
and
go
for
an
aecht
schlenkerla
if
i
want
a
clean
german
lager
with
a
rachbier
background
i
would
select
this
i
purchased
a
500

bottle
in
iowa

trying

dark
copper
with
a
thin

pleasantly
smokey
tastes
like
a
typical
lager
but
with
a
thorough
yet
not
overpowering
smokiness
mouthfeel
is
a
little
thin
but
surprisingly
drinkable
for
a
smoked

i
could
picture
being

at
the
brewery
located
on
the
river
drinking
this
on
tap
would
be
such
a
treat
in
any
case
for
what
it
was
this

the
smokiness
here
seems
to
be
expressed
through
leather
hints
theres
also
a

going

beer
this
is
perfect
for
when
one
of
the

offerings
would
be
too
much
this
beer
pours
with
some
viscosity
it
creates
small
bubbly
tan
head
above
the
slightly
hazed
light
copper
beer
that
literally
vanishes
before
my
very
eyes
the
aroma
reminds
me
of
camping
in
the
wisconsin
northwoods
damp
and
smoky
wet
leaves
i
like
it
a
lot
the
smoke
is
very
subtle
on
the
nose
on
the
buds
this
one
hits
the
spot
the
smoke
is
intertwined
nicely
with
some
slightly
bitter

tones
a
toasty
vienna
like
malt
foundation
no
ashtray
here
just
a
nice
drinking
rauchbier
recommended
for
fans
and
novices
alike
this
rauchbier
poured
a
clear
dark
amber
color
with
creamy
light
tan
foam
that
settled
but
coated
the
glass
the
smell
was
mildly
malty
the
taste
was
malty
with
a
hint
of
smokiness
and
with
tangy
hops
in
the
finish
very
nice
and
not
overly
smokey
the
mouthfeel
was
smooth
with
medium
body
and
moderate
carbonation
there
was
a
slight
smokey
feel
and
a
light
tanginess
this
was
a
very
nice
rauchbier
with
a
light
smokiness
very
easy
to
drink
beautiful
golden
orange
color
with
a
foamy
bubbly
white
head
smell
is
of
a
distinct
smokiness
most
akin
to
smoked
salmon
with
some
caramel
thrown
in
for
good
measure

moderate
smokiness
penetrates
through
the
palate
leaving
notes
of
bready

spicy

and
smoked

mediumbodied
lightly
carbonated
with
a
smooth

mouthfeel
drinkability
is
good
for
the
style
but
this
beer
is
still
a
little
much
for
me
to
regularly
drink
nonetheless
an
attractive
rauchbier
with
lots
of
character
that
would
be
perfect
with
your
next
barbecue
turbid
orange
based
gold
color
with
nice
thicket
of
white
head
smoky
nose
to
some
extent
definitely
not
overwhelming
smells
more
of
a
quality
lager
with
a
slight
smoky
nose
almost
as
how
ones
clothes
smell
the
day
after
being
around
a
campfire
minus
of
course
the
humanly
stenches
of
dayold
clothing
i
feel
some
smoked
beers
can
be
a
little
taxing
in
the
drinkability
department
but
this
one
has
the
sublty
to
send
its
drinkability
sky
high
a
plethora
of
culinary
delights
could
be
paired
with
this
beer
orangecopper
in
appearance
with
a
nice
size
head
a
bit
of
caramel
in
the
aroma
smokiness
is
very
mild
smoke
is
a
little
more
prevalent
in
the
taste
but
still
very
mild
a
slight
metallic
taste
as
well
although
this
is
a
lager
it
reminds
me
of
an
amber
ale
i
was
looking
for
a
more
intense
smokey
flavor
a
somewhat
enjoyable
beer
but
it
doesnt
compare
to
some
of
the
other
rauchbiers
ive
had
a
nice
copper
color
pours
with
a
good
cream
tan
colored
head
first
aroma
is
of
a
hoppy
spiciness
a
bit
surprising
in
a
good
way
but
then
a
background
smokiness
kicks
in
and
soon
becomes
all
you
can
smell
good
amount
of
body
to
this
brew
nice
solid
malt
presence
accompanied
by
a
bit
of
malt
sweetness
very
nice
finishes
with
a
smoky
finish
that
soon
infuses
the
whole
taste
of
the
beer
from
start
to
finish
the
smoke
is
reasonably
subdued
though
not
quite
as
good
and
hearty
as
when
sampled
fresh
at
the
brewery
but
if
this
is
all
you
can
get
dont
miss
it
another
beer
id
never
seen
on
tap
at
redbones
which
meant
only
one
thing
try
it
and
review
it
here
goes
poured
a
dark
straw
color
with
about
the
prettiest
head
ive
ever
seen
nice
creamy
and
rounded
this
was
in
a
half
pint
glass
not
a
true
pint
glass
however
the
aroma
was
woody
sweetfruity
and
of
course
smokey
taste
was
actually
slightly
sweet
and
mild
followed
by
an
all
smoke
finish
the
adjective
that
comes
to
mind
for
this
brew
is
mild
the
smoke
flavor
is
not
overwhelming
not
a
style
i
would
go
for
normally
but
certainely
worthy
of
a
half
pint
which
wasnt
bad
drinking
pat
taste
clean
smoked
grilled
wurstel
but
maybe
too
marked
and
invedent
you
can
only
feel
a
light
note
of
malt
and
hops
light
body
too
but
with
a
great
drinkability

almost
seems
to
dissapate
and
malt
flavors
become
more
assertive
as
i
drink
this
brew
hop
bitterness
is
moderate
and
pleasant
while
the
hop
flavor
is
herbal
hallertauer
finishes
clean
and
crisp
w
a
mellow
and
fading
smokiness
this
is
the
most
drinkable
rauchbier
ive
had
it
wet
my
appetite
for
smoked
food
i
will
now
comb
the
pantry
this
was
the
first
zero
gravity
beer
i
tried
several
years
ago
it
wasnt
that
good
then
now
its
amazing
so
so
much
better
onice
example
of
the
style
easy
drinking
and
enjoyable
1537
dreally
nice
beer
great
food
beer
i
would
drink
this
again
wow
the
taste
is
awesome
its
smokey
but
also
very
rich
malty
with
a
light
hoppysmokey
finish
very
nice
crisp
an
smooth
mouthfeel
with
a
dry
finishthays
really
good
one
of
the
best
rauchbiers
ive
ever
had
its
always
nice
to
have
a
local
version
of
this
style
its
rich
satisfying
and
definitely
something
that
youll
want
to
savor
slowly
and
sparingly
a
decent
pour
for
the
style
as
it
settles
in
and
gives
off
a
nice
two
finger
head
tha
slips
down
the
sides
of
the
glass
effortlessly
aroma
was
smoked
to
high
heaven
but
rather
one
sided
some
touches
of
a
cough
syrup
like
smell
coming
off
it
as
it
warmed
not
sure
what
that
was
but
hints
of
grain
buried
underneath
as
well
the
flavor
was
surprisingly
good
though
rich
notes
here
of
peat
and
malted
grains
nice
roasted
touches
and
a
very
nice
and
well
balanced
grain
bill
definitely
a
very
nice
flavor
and
it
took
me
off
guard
the
feel
was
a
bit
thin
and
one
sided
but
still
not
terrible
the
cpj
a
12
ounce
bottle
from
a
mixed
pack
poured
into
a
standard
shaker
glass
this
rauch
appears
a
clear
medium
chestnut
color
with
a
finger
of
fizzy
ecru
foam
the
head
vanishes
in
less
than
a
minute
smells
and
tastes
of
very
mild
smoke
maybe
i
use
the
schlenkerla
rauchs
as
a
standard
but
this
is
barely
kissed
with
smoke
notes
of
spicysweet
caramelized
malts
are
also
present
rather
thin
and
watery
as
well
with
just
about
adequate
carbonation
take
it
or
leave
it
good
drinkability
too
bad
this
isnt
one
of
their
regulars
this
is
one
of
their
better
ones
twelve
ounces
of
amberorange
body
and
no
ead
what
so
ever
not
much
carbonation
bubbles
either
caramel
malts
and
thats
pretty
much
it
in
the
nose
i
taste
some
malts
and
smoke
the
smoke
is
at
the
end
of
the
sip
and
its
nice
its
not
offensive
to
meits
delicate
its
a
bit
watery
but
that
doesnt
take
any
points
from
the
overall
score
this
is
tasty
as
are
all
of
the
saranac
beers
ive
tried
so
far
they
do
a
good
job
smooth
body
and
carbonation
is
tingly
overall
take
on
it
this
is
a
rauchbier
for
people
that
dont
like
rauchbiers
a
good
primer
for
those
wanting
to
try
this
style
i
really
enjoyed
this
beer
if
they
had
just
called
it
a
malty
beer
or
a
beer
its
got
some
good
flavor
and
is
good
drinkability
the
last
of
the
winter
pack
we
had
not
a
bad
drink
at
all
dont
let
the
word
smoked
on
the
label
through
you
off
saranac
rauchbier
is
oh
so
close
to
good
beer
if
i
could
send
a
smoke
signal
message
to
the
brewers
it
would
go
something
like
this
add
more
smoke
to
rauchbier
please
its
too
bad
more
american
craft
brewers
dont
take
a
shot
at
this
style
pours
a
quarter
inch
off
white
head
that
fades
quickly
to
a
ring
on
the
glass
with
a
orange
amber
color
smelled
a
little
musty
or
like
over
ripe
fruit
taste
was
stale
bread
maltyness
with
a
touch
of
toffee
and
very
slight
smoke
taste
mouthfeel
was
ok
would
not
buy
this
beer
again
not
a
fan
of
smoked
beers
in
general
overall
this
is
an
ok
beer
i
did
enjoy
it
but
there
are
a
lot
of
things
that
could
be
improved
kudos
to
saranac
for
trying
some
less
common
styles
and
giving
them
to
us
in
a
12
pack
with
one
beer
per
style
so
we
can
sample
poured
out
an
orange
golden
honey
brown
with
a
thin
quickly
dissapearing
off
white
head
the
nose
is
mostly
munich
malt
biscuity
in
a
way
with
some
toffee
sweetness
and
a
bit
of
hickory
the
taste
is
more
like
a
dark
lager
than
a
rauchbier
has
some
maltyness
to
it
and
a
bit
of
well
malt
nothing
else
here
no
smoke
no
rauch
no
fun
has
a
medium
body
and
slightly
carbonated
mouthfeel
fairly
drinkable
but
a
terrible
example
of
the
style
clear
medium
amberorange
with
a
small
creamy
offwhite
slowlydiminishing
head
smell
is
of
lightly
smoky
malts
supported
by
some
light
citrus
from
the
hops
some
very
light
earthy
yeast
and
caramel
taste
is
more
of
the
same
except
with
more
piney
hops
than
the
citrus
in
the
nose
it
has
a
medium
body
dry
texture
and
soft
carbonation
this
is
very
good
for
a
rauchbier
because
it
lets
the
smoke
aroma
and
flavor
stand
out
without
being
overpowering
or
faketasting
like
so
many
other
rauchbiers
ive
tasted
very
easy
drinking
and
enjoyable
a
delicate
smokiness
enhances
and
also
acts
as
a
counterpoint
to
the
gently
caramelish
maltiness
of
saranacs
rauchbier
it
pours
a
clear
glowing
ambercopper
body
beneath
a
short
head
of
creamy
ivory
beechwood
smoke
is
found
in
the
nose
but
it
doesnt
leap
out
at
you
and
when
some
of
the
sweetish
malt
from
below
peeks
through
it
takes
on
the
mouthwatering
scent
of
bacon
its
crisp
in
the
mouth
with
a
delicate
mediumlight
body
and
finebubbled
median
carbonation
the
carbonation
helps
to
bring
out
the
smokiness
and
cut
through
the
maltiness
the
flavor
is
initially
fairly
light
on
smoke
but
as
you
progress
through
the
glass
it
builds
on
the
palate
increasing
its
presence
its
lagerlike
clean
and
just
a
touch
sulphury
underneath
the
malt
is
lightly
caramelish
a
touch
sweet
honeyish
and
backed
by
some
grassy
and
spicy
hops
the
smokiness
runs
the
gamut
from
smoked
meats
and
ham
specifically
to
scotch
wiskey
its
drying
and
in
combination
with
the
jagged
bitterness
leaves
the
palate
mostly
scrubbed
of
malt
smoke
lingers
and
its
kind
of
cigarlike
but
not
nearly
as
full
or
harsh
well
done
nicely
rounded
with
a
good
balance
and
an
appropriate
level
of
smokiness
worth
trying
12oz
bown
bottle
with
no

pours
a
crystal
clear
medium
light
amber
with
a
poor
head
and
lace
rather
weak
smelling
caramel
malts
are
present
mixed
with
a
slight
hop
floralness
and
an
even
slighter
smokiness
upon
tasting
caramel
notes
are
up
front
mixed
with
a
decent
hop
flavor
but
very
little
smokiness
as
a
rauchbier
it
is
poor
but
as
a
traditional
lager
its
not
bad
ill
give
it
average
on
taste
because
its
a
decent
lager
but
poor
as
a
smoked
lager
its
is
a
very
drinkable
beer
though
it
tastes
like
they
took
their
typical
lager
and
added
just
a
tiny
bit
of
smoke
d
not
bad
a
nice
addition
to
the
winterpack
ive
never
had
a
rauchbier
before
but
this
seems
kind
of
like
a
rauchbiers
little
brother
the
potential
is
there
but
it
hasnt
reached
adulthood
yet
thanks
to
saranac
for
putting
out
such
diverse
styles
in
a
single
package
at
a
cheap
price
an
average
beer
good
to
eat
with
a
grilled
sausage
sandwich
defintly
not
a
style
for
everyone
this
one
is
just
an
average
offering
to
the
style
drink
it
if
oyu
got
it
in
the
mixed
pack
but
otherwise
pass
drinkability
good
going
down
but
the

smokiness
probably
turns
off

a

that

clean
and
dry
with
weak
traces
of
charred

and
a
humble

residue
as
far
as
german
amber
lagers
go
this
is
highly
drinkable
and
unique
but
its
really
lacking
the
true
smoke
taste
and
aroma
of
a
traditional
rauchbier
the
beer
pours
a
gold
color
with
a
slight
reddish
hue
it
has
a
nice
foamy
white
head
that
slowly
fades
to
lacing
the
aroma
is
decent
it
has
a
dry
malty
scent
that
boasts
of
munich
and
a
bit
of
peated
malt
the
smoke
scent
is
faint
the
taste
is
decent
also
it
has
a
very
average
taste
with
a
bit
of
munich
and
very
little
peated
malt
its
light
and
easy
drinking
but
lacking
in
character
the
mouthfeel
is
fine
it
is
a
mediumfull
bodied
beer
with
good
carbonation
this
is
an
average
brew
its
run
of
the
mill
i
wonder
why
these
guys
even
bother
with
making
such
poor
examples
of
the
styles
hell
even
ab
is
making
better
beer
these
days
oelergud
brew
poured
to
a
clear
amber
color
with
a
ever
so
slight
off
whitelight
tan
head
that
had
no
real
retention
and
left
hardly
no
lacing
at
all
the
aroma
is
of
malt
mostly
maybe
some
smokiness
but
i
am
having
a
hard
time
picking
it
up
the
malts
seem
to
remind
me
of
caramel
the
taste
is
interesting
definite
malt
flavors
come
through
at
the
start
with
a
slight
smoke
flavor
that
comes
bout
in
the
middle
and
sticks
around
for
a
bit
over
all
it
is
a
pretty
good
brew
not
sure
how
it
would
stack
up
with
others
within
the
same
type
category
but
i
would
suppose
that
it
is
a
nice
intro
to
this
style
i
feel
that
saranac
his
hit
the
mark
based
on
what
i
have
seen
them
produce
in
these
limited
batches
nice
addition
to
the
12
beers
of
winter
while
introducing
people
to
different
beers
amber
thin
body
ruachbier
the
smoke
takes
a
few
sips
to
get
through
the
malty
overtones
rocky
head
but
not
chewy
like
other
rauchbiers
nose
is
malty
and
very
faint
smoke
smooth
clean
mouthfeel
and
since
not
real
smoky
or
heavy
quite
drinkable
but
not
overpowering
a
nice
effort
by
a
large
brewing
company
light
and
watery
smooth
but
without
much
body
sits
on
the
tongue
a
bit
light
color
and
feel
the
dark
flavor
is
suprising
given
how
light
it
looks
a
very
solid
beer
surprisingly
good
a
weak
flavored
rauchbier
not
unpleasant
but
not
a
good
take
on
the
style
whatsoever
not
a
lager
to
be
proud
of
this
is
not
a
bad
tasting
beer
at
all
but
i
have
to
doubt
whether
it
can
really
be
called
a
rauchbier
okay
they
used
smoked
malts
but
it
doesnt
have
the
gusto
of
other
more
assertive
smoked
beers
bah
humbug
got
this
in
the
saranac
12
beers
of
winter
sampler
this
would
be
my
first
foray
into
the
rauchbier
style
this
was
an
excellent
tasting
lager
and
much
better
than
saranacs
adirondack
lager
the
smokiness
was
barely
noticable
but
perhaps
thats
what
makes
this
an
all
around
good
beer
would
serve
this
beer
at
barbques
and
with
other
smoked
foods
im
eager
to
try
some
true
german
made
rauchbiers
with
the
stronger
smoke
flavors
after
this
one
sarancac
should
add
this
to
their
regular
lineup
saranac
rauchbier
is
a
clear
amber
beer
with
a
shallow
white
head
the
aroma
is
full
of
soft
melanoidinladen
malt
theres
a
very
modest
hint
of
smokiness
behind
the
malts
its
a
mild
and
simple
smoke
sensation
one
that
seems
like
more
of
an
afterthought
than
a
centerpiece
the
taste
is
similar
with
lightlyroasted
and
a
bit
smoky
malt
flavors
the
finish
is
moderately
dry
with
a
slight
bitterness
soft
and
round
mouthfeel
with
lower
than
average
carbonation
this
is
a
pretty
good
beer
but
id
like
a
rauchbier
to
have
a
lot
more
smoke
character
this
one
is
far
too
restrained
ill
definitely
have
another
soon
cheers
pours
a
clear
golden
amber
color
with
a
small
head
which
dissipates
quickly
leaving
no
head
the
smell
is
of
caramel
malts
but
no
real
hint
of
any
smokiness
to
it
the
taste
is
of
dull
hops
caramel
malts
again
no
real
smoke
taste
light
bodied
well
carbonated
finishes
easy
not
dry
or
bitter
this
lager
drinks
well
enough
though
it
reminds
me
more
of
an
amber
lager
poured
from
a
12oz
bottle
into
a
pint
glass
a
nice
golden
color
with
what
looks
like
good
carbonation
and
almost
no
head
retention
no
lacing
to
speak
of
either
a
very
light
fruity
aroma
a
nice
robust
taste
as
it
hits
the
buds
not
as
carbonated
as
it
looked
from
initial
viewing
definately
could
be
a
little
more
carbonated
imo
mouthfeel
was
good
pretty
drinkable
doesnt
leave
a
very
pleasant
after
taste
pretty
well
drinkable
taste
did
start
to
fade
as
beer
warmed
up
might
just
be
me
something
i
have
never
experienced
before
overall
a
drinkable
beer
one
i
would
like
to
try
with
a
good
burger
overall
boooo
what
a
letdown
no
smokiness
at
all
so
watery
and
so
little
flavor
the
dud
of
the
12
pack
sampler
appears
a
light
copper
amber
tone
leaves
even
lace
with
an
off
white
head
almost
a
beige
tone
aroma
has
malts
that
come
with
upfront
caramel
and
a
touch
of
smoked
malts
just
barely
evident
flavor
is
clean
with
mild
smokey
flavor
and
leafy
tobacco
hop
tones
that
blend
well
together
overall
a
mild
mainstream
rauchbier
better
than
nothing
but
by
no
means
comparable
to
a
true
rauch
from
bamberg
mouthfeel
is
medium
bodied
evenly
carbonated
not
much
else
going
on
in
the
complexity
region
drinkability
is
decent
but
by
no
means
is
this
a
rauchbier
and
flavors
dont
blend
that
well
overall
im
not
impressed
by
this
effort
the
obvious
this
beer
lacks
that
authentic
smokey
presence
that
any
true
german
rauchbier
would
flaunt
reminds
me
more
of
an
oktoberfest
with
its
juicy
caramel
malts
and
clean
drinkable
quality
a
nice
drinking
beer
but
i
think
they
forgot
to
put
any
smokiness
in
my
bottle
horrible
representation
of
the
style
very
little
if
any
smoke
prescence
seems
like
a
decent
amber
beer
but
rauchbier
im
not
sure
definitly
the
most
dispointing
in
the
12
pack
sampler
would
never
think
about
picking
this
up
again
and
would
advise
the
same
taste
is
the
same
sweet
up
front
with
a
slightly
smoky
hoppiness
bitterness
toward
the
end
if
this
were
called
saranac
amber
lager
it
wouldve
scored
higher
because
the
beer
itself
isnt
terrible
tasting
theres
just
no
way
its
a
rauch
mouthfeel
is
thin
and
fizzy
not
awful
but
misleading
in
title
this
tastes
like
water
compared
to
an
actual
rauch
bottom
linenot
a
smoked
beer
at
all
worst
of
the
12
pack
by
far
i
had
this
one
with
some
very
good
smoked
salmonand
it
ruined
the
experience
ill
not
try
this
one
again
in
fact
i
am
now
done
with
the
2006
winter
12
pack
and
i
will
definitely
not
get
another
12
pack
this
season
very
disappointing
overall
only
liked
2
of
the
new
ones
saranac
failed
here
for
sure
notes
maybe
its
the
light
smoke
maybe
its
the
fact
f
x
matt
brewing
was
daring
enough
to
make
a
try
at
the
style
i
dont
know
all
i
know
is
i
bought
this
12
beer
sampler
for
this
one
and
have
fallen
for
it
regardless
of
whether
it
is
appropriate
for
the
style
or
not
its
official
matt
brewing
here
is
your
winner
brew
it
year
round
change
the
name
to
something
like
campfire
smoke
lager
and
put
it
in
cans
this
is
my
savior
beer
and
i
am
madly
in
love
poured
a
deep
burnt
orangegolden
with
a
nice
fluffy
well
formed
white
head
that
stuck
around
for
quite
awhile
a
pretty
clean
nose
with
light
notes
of
brwon
sugar
and
subtle
smoke
and
even
a
tinge
of
ironwhat
i
liked
about
this
rauchbier
is
that
it
gave
off
smoked
flavor
without
tasting
like
a
smithfield
ham
i
know
alot
of
people
like
that
big
smoke
me
not
so
much
this
gave
off
enough
smoke
flavor
to
satisfy
with
out
being
overbearing
a
nice
brown
sugar
note
went
along
with
the
smokiness
along
with
a
noticable
herbal
sharp
hoppiness
i
like
it
i
like
it
alot
i
like
the
new
offerings
in
the12
beers
of
christmas
pack
this
year
d
the
beer
is
drinkable
with
a
nice
malt
mouth
but
dont
expect
a
real
smoked
experience
this
12
oz
bottle
was
from
a
2006
beers
of
winter
variety
pack
none
of
the
saranac
beers
in
this
box
has
any
freshness
dating
pours
clear
light
orangy
amber
thin
off
white
head
and
leaving
minimal
lacing
malty
nose
with
perhaps
the
slightest
hint
of
smoke
pleasant
enough
brew
nothing
remarkable
very
minor
smoke
presence
typical
middle
of
the
road
saranac
offering
craft
beer
maybe
but
just
barely
poured
12
oz
bottle
into
a
glass
mug
nice
orangeamber
color
with
a
small
white
head
the
smell
of
smoke
is
prevalent
even
in
the
smell
tasted
very
smooth
and
it
had
a
smoky
meat
aftertaste
which
was
very
delightful
and
made
me
want
to
go
camping
very
nice
mouthfeel
didnt
feel
like
i
was
drinking
water
i
like
the
smoky
taste
so
id
have
to
say
that
this
beer
is
very
drinkable
adn
will
be
with
me
next
time
im
going
camping
or
roasting
something
over
a
fire
pit
md
smooth
and
easy
down
a
nice
beer
with
a
nice
blended
flavor
but
unremarkable
pours
a
rich
honey
color
thin
white
head
not
much
retentionbut
decent
lacing
smell
is
sweet
and
smoked
body
is
medium
no
carbionation
to
speak
of
taste
is
of
bready
malts
with
a
hint
of
smoke
nice
sweet
honey
like
finish
a
very
enjoyable
brew
pours
a
clear
light
orange
color
with
a
thin
head
of
small
bubbles
smoke
is
readily
apparent
in
the
nose
at
first
but
quickly
fades
fades
to
a
light
smoke
and
bread
along
side
a
rich
sweet
malt
flavor
follows
suit
with
the
aroma
smoke
and
bread
give
way
to
the
sweet
malt
malty
aftertaste
no
hops
to
speak
of
overall
light
on
the
smokiness
but
very
well
done
very
easy
to
drink
and
a
departure
from
a
standard
lager
for
whatever
reason
this
one
hit
the
spot
i
am
not
a
rauchbier
fan
i
likened
the
first
i
tried
to
beer
strained
through
the
ashes
left
in
the
bottom
of
my
fireplace
not
a
pleasant
thought
so
when
i
bought
the
12
beers
of
winter
from
saranac
the
other
day
i
figured
id
probably
be
discarding
this
one
after
tasting
it
surprise
it
was
really
pretty
good
not
that
im
a
rauchbier
convert
but
this
time
the
smoke
flavor
was
more
like
the
traditional
roasting
i
was
used
to
seemed
a
bit
more
carbonated
than
expected
but
that
helped
make
it
taste
more
refreshing
than
it
might
have
been
definitely
worth
a
tryespecially
in
the
variety
pack
cheers
its
a
nice
beer
its
just
a
shame
its
not
actually
that
smokey
yeah
i
can
tell
the
smoke
is
there
somewhere
but
up
against
another
american
smoked
lager
ft
collins
zs
lager
this
beer
just
doesnt
hold
up
it
looks
like
an
amber
beer
smells
of
amber
malts
with
a
hint
of
smoke
tastes
of
burnt
caramel
kind
of
smoke
and
the
flavor
isnt
too
rich
basically
like
the
adirondack
amber
with
a
little
something
extra
meh
overall
a
tasty
beer
however
not
really
a
rauchbier
as
there
was
little
to
no
smoked
element
i
poured
from
a
12
ounze
bottle
into
a
solo
cup
all
of
my
glasses
were
dirty
i
did
notice
that
there
wasnt
much
head
or
much
lace
the
smell
was
pretty
decent
bitter
but
subtle
the
taste
was
essectially
the
same
this
was
a
solid
beer
but
not
awsome
dont
drink
and
review
drinkability
pretty
decent
overall
and
this
would
pair
nicely
with
some
milder
bbq
since
the
smoke
tones
are
weak
but
wouldnt
overpower
the
food
worth
trying
in
the
variety
12
pack
quite
a
let
down
from
saranac
usually
thier
seasonals
a
pretty
damn
good
but
this
just
doesnt
do
it
no
smoke
present
at
all
i
guess
after
youve
aecht
schlenkerla
no
other
rauchbier
will
do
this
is
one
of
saranacs
bizzaro
creations
that
they
seem
to
trot
out
every
winter
a
drinkable
beer
that
sails
vastly
wide
of
the
style
printed
on
the
label
i
like
saranac
though
their
seasonals
can
be
somewhat
hitormiss
im
impressed
by
their
willingness
to
tackle
rauchbier
and
have
some
moderate
success
in
doing
so
