i
would
love
to
try
beers
from
100
countries
but
until
we
start
getting
better
imports
such
as
some
foreign
craft
beers
that
i
have
read
about
i
will
have
to
endure
a
lot
of
mediocrepoor
brew
to
reach
my
goal
this
beer
could
be
dangerous
it
is
easy
to
drink
and
if
served
by
the
pint
or
by
the
pitcher
i
could
see
with
a
few
slices
of
pizza
of
downing
a
gallon
of
this
stuff
it
might
not
be
delicious
but
it
sure
is
easy
to
drink
cheers
overall
a
really
unbalanced
beer
loads
of
malts
and
caramel
with
little
else
add
in
the
watered
down
mouthfeel
and
this
beer
doesnt
have
a
lot
going
for
it
but
its
interesting
to
try
beer
from
unassuming
countries
such
as
greece
overall
i
couldnt
bring
myself
to
call
it
average
but
i
also
couldnt
really
rate
it
as
good
as
a
4
it
feels
like
as
youre
drinking
it
you
almost
feel
a
potential
that
it
just
doesnt
live
up
to
tastes
better
than
i
expected
it
isnt
as
sweet
as
the
smell
suggests
theres
also
enough
hop
to
give
some
good
balance
body
is
okay
and
the
carbonation
is
slightly
understated
pretty
much
tastes
like
a
sweet
american
amber
i
poured
this
really
average
beer
into
my
tumbler
at
45
degrees
the
beer
was
a
reddish
color
and
poured
a
tan
head
head
the
beer
was
a
bready
tasting
affair
and
really
had
nothing
exceptional
but
then
it
really
was
not
terrible
either
regardless
it
just
did
not
stand
out
enough
warrant
buying
again

2

the

and
some

mouthfeelbody
is
lightmedium
its
a
bit
creamy
with
moderate
carbonation
its
also
smooth
and
easy
enough
to
drink
overall
i
think
this
is
an
ok
brew
and
worth
trying
o
this
is
an
okay
dark
lager
it
was
better
than
their
regular
lager
had
this
with
my
excellent
gyro
at
lefteris
restaurant
in
tarrytown
ny
about
an
hour
before
i
saw
los
lonely
boys
rock
the
music
hall
and
what
a
pleasant
surprise
i
expected
an
adjunct
but
this
beer
was
quite
good
poured
a
nice
copper
with
about
a
finger
of
head
and
some
nice
lacing
malty
smell
with
just
a
hint
of
hop
slightly
sweet
with
a
caramel
overtone
good
carbonation
which
cut
through
the
strong
lamb
flavors
i
was
eating
very
drinkable
and
a
great
compliment
to
the
greek
food
i
eat
at
lefteris
when
i
can
so
ill
be
ordering
this
up
again
good
beer
that
is
very
drinkable
o
overall
this
beer
is
nothing
spectacular
but
certainly
not
the
worst
ive
had
definitely
a
good
middle
of
the
road
euro
lager
and
certainly
worth
a
shot
would
have
again
solid
1
thumb
up
not
a
bad
beer
at
all
my
only
question
is
what
is
glucose
syrup
doing
in
my
beer
this
beer
has
a
dark
brassy
color
and
good
stickage
on
the
glass
it
has
a
bready
aroma
with
some
sweetness
and
hints
of
cooked
veggies
and
herbal
hops
its
very
smooth
with
some
body
its
maltiness
and
bready
caramel
un
dertones
all
go
dry
with
a
pulling
graininess
the
hops
are
modest
with
a
kiss
of
bitterness
and
some
vague
flavor
in
the
end
dried
hay
and
a
bit
of
dry
biscuit
finish
things
off
this
beer
settles
in
to
be
a
decent
amber
lager
we
were
asked
to
pair
it
with
a
burger
as
well
and
we
agreed
for
some
reason
i
thought
this
beer
would
be
bad
its
not
mythos
is
most
likely
a
irishstyle
beer
that
has
been
lagered
instead
of
treated
like
estery
irish
ales
this
gives
a
very
clean
and
smooth
flavor
and
feel
to
the
maltysweet
beer
and
with
just
enough
malt
complexity
the
beer
doesnt
need
much
else
d
goes
down
easily
not
filling
the
sweetness
in
the
finish
detracts
slightly
not
a
bad
beer
but
i
wouldnt
seek
it
out
d
easily
could
knock
back
a
few
but
it
isnt
my
favorite
more
of
a
caramel
sweetness
in
the
taste
nutty
and
slightly
sharp
and
metallic
but
not
to
an
unbearable
extent
not
as
bad
as
i
expected
i
wouldnt
buy
it
but
it
has
to
be
better
than
their
green
bottle
helles
lager
d
tasty
goes
down
very
easily
not
too
filling
mild
kick
good
representation
of
style
this
is
a
very
solid
beer
that
is
worth
drinking
for
an
entire
evening
prolly
the
best
qualityprice
ratio
of
any
beer
you
can
get
here
d
being
in
greece
this
would
be
my
choice
if
one
prefers
local
products
might
change
my
review
in
case
chemicals
are
added
the
beer
is
thin
and
watery
actually
and
a
bit
of
a
let
down
after
the
intial
smells
and
first
couple
of
sips
what
i
thought
and
hoped
id
found
wasnt
up
to
stratch
in
the
end
a
pity
awesome
notes
of
cocoa
make
for
a
great

enough
to
satisfy
the

with

lovers
happy
easy

and
accessible
to
fans
of
any
beer
style
when
i
got
home
i
was
unbelievably
impressed
great
pour
great
smell
amazing
head
how
many
times
are
we
actually
able
to
say
that
in
our
lives
it
was
rich
malty
hoppy
and
dark
honey
dark
caramel
chocolate
fall
leaves
and
burnt
hay
just
fantastic
overall
for
a
edl
i
enjoyed
it
ill
revisit
thus
again
one
of
the
best
lagers
i
have
ever
tasted
i
only
sought
this
after
seeing
it
being
made
on
the
beer
geeks
tv
show
great
on
tap
at
the
brewery
where
i
was
told
i
would
not
be
able
to
find
it
in
bottle
shops
heh
that
may
have
been
true
in
sd
but
in
la
i
tracked
a
couple
down
still
tasty
as
hell
this
beer
is
disgusting
i
love
the
idea
but
the
execution
is
appalling
really
granted
my
bottle
had
a
little
date
on
it
and
may
have
deteriorated
some
but
i
cannot
imagine
a
great
beer
ever
lived
in
here
sticky
brown
caramel
color
with
some
tan
suds
the
nose
is
sweet
malt
but
not
fresh
and
harvest
grainy
but
more
a
euro
extract
thing
like
a
home
brewers
extract
no
hops
at
all
in
nose
or
taste
but
thats
there
least
of
the
worries
here
the
flavor
is
an
acrid
funk
that
turns
into
unfermented
sweetness
old
taffy
and
gum
and
gross
fair
candy
come
to
the
forefront
behind
stale
grain
and
other
off
flavors
hard
to
believe
this
is
rated
as
high
as
it
is
thick
and
textured
for
a
lager
although
carbonation
is
fine
the
price
is
right
on
some
of
these
port
bombers
but
as
much
as
midnight
expression
made
my
day
for
being
so
awesome
and
cheap
this
one
turned
me
right
back
off
if
you
can
make
older
viscosity
you
can
do
better
than
this
a
real
interesting
refreshing
take
on
a
lager
and
quite
fun
too
very
nice
overall
a
decent
lager
worth
trying
maybe
youll
like
it
a
lot
more
than
i
did
it
also
wasnt
terribly
expensive
so
a
worthwhile
experiment
overall
im
into
trying
new
brews
but
this
one
was
a
disappointment
im
a
big
fan
of
west
coast
ipa
and
this
lager
didnt
do
it
for
me

alcohol
is

after
the

overall
this
is
an
excellent
stein
beer
dark
lager
all
around
nice
balance
complexity
and
robustness
of
flavors
and
very
smooth
to
drink
a
very
enjoyable
offering
it
is
an
interesting
note
about
dropping
the
glowing
hot
rocks
into
the
boil
but
i
wonder
how
much
that
contributes
overall
to
the
flavor
this
is
just
a
great
standard
beer
with
some
great
properties
i
like
the
way
it
laces
on
the
sides
i
like
the
semichocolatey
taste
i
like
the
6
5
abv
its
not
a
super
awesome
brew
but
a
great
standard
which
is
very
easy
to
drink
and
with
a
respectable
abv
overall
this
is
pretty
good
it
wont
knock
anybody
socks
off
but
it
doesnt
do
anything
wrong
i
probably
gave
this
beer
a
bit
better
rating
than
i
should
have
it
definitely
had
its
moments
o
delicious
refreshing
gulpable
sweet
balanced
earthy
good
price
point
5
15
ill
buy
again
o
interesting
and
not
exactly
what
i
was
expecting
when
i
opened
this
one
the
hot
volcanic
lava
rocks
must
have
made
the
brewing
experience
interesting
very
malty
but
pretty
easy
to
drink
reminds
me
a
bit
of
a
schwartzbier
o
this
beer
is
easy
to
drink
and
seems
a
little
reminiscent
of
a
schwartzbier
and
a
porter
taste
is
nice
zesty
toasty
caramelly
dark
chocolate
dry
woodytoasty
licorice
finish
with
light
bitterness
after
being
sweeter
up
front
feel
is
good
however
it
does
not
pack
much
character
for
the
abv
an
interesting
brew
that
really
has
some
euro
flavor
with
an
american
slant
that
makes
it
interesting
but
not
great
definitely
worth
a
try
if
you
see
it
on
tap
i
dont
think
many
will
dislike
this
beer
but
of
course
not
many
may
fall
head
over
heals
for
it
either
overall
good
but
not
impressive
comes
across
as
fairly
generic
lots
of
simple
hop
character
with
a
basic
malt
character
based
on
the
flavor
profile
id
have
never
guessed
this
to
be
a
pale
ale
or
a
light
ipa
not
a
lager
o
ive
gotta
get
this
again
this
beer
impressed
me
with
its
quirky
character
and
refreshing
flavor
and
body
ill
see
if
my
lighter
beer
drinking
friends
might
like
this
very
easy
drinking
and
packed
with
flavor
a
very
nicely
done
dark
lager
this
was
a
good
beer
sweeter
than
i
expected
with
no
roastyness
to
speak
of
still
worth
a
try
overall
okay
by
all
standards
if
you
like
this
style
you
will
most
likely
enjoy
this
brew
port
does
a
good
job
with
their
hot
rocks
lager
but
it
misses
the
mark
for
me
the
combination
of
malty
sweetness
and
roasty
grains
coats
the
tongue
in
a
manner
which
i
dont
much
care
for
in
any
event
a
solid
brew
but
one
i
wont
be
revisiting
any
time
soon
o
intriquing
flavor
at
the
start
interesting
but
a
bomber
may
overstay
its
welcome
as
it
loses
some
mystic
by
the
bottoms
end
i
would
suggest
splitting
with
a
friend
the
flavor
stays
fresh
intriquuing
and
leaving
you
wanting
more
this
way
then
like
a
house
guest
after
3
days
still
an
interesting
take
this
is
a
nice
dark
lager
when
i
got
the
initial
hits
of
malt
and
caramel
i
was
worried
that
it
was
going
to
be
too
much
but
it
ended
up
being
quite
balanced
and
even
thorough
flavor
profile
even
delivery
not
overly
complex
but
it
works
i
can
dig
it
deep
brownalmost
black
in
body
with
khaki
head
that
stays
around
smells
of
hazelnut
almost
light
coffee
and
vague
pine
tastes
of
hazelnut
roasted
coffee
slight
prune
vague
chocolate
and
some
grassiness
colalike
in
mouthfeel
and
medium
bodied
sticky
on
the
palate
but
worth
trying
not
something
id
buy
regularly
but
a
tasty
one
off
o
not
to
bad
pours
an
almost
opaque
super
dark
brown
with
a
1
inch
foamy
dark
khaki
head
that
settles
to
an
oily
film
on
top
of
the
beer
small
dots
of
lace
of
lace
form
randomly
around
the
glass
on
the
drink
down
smell
is
of
toasted
malt
slight
caramel
and
some
mineral
aromas
taste
is
of
roasted
and
toasted
malt
and
some
burnt
caramel
and
slight
mineral
flavors
there
is
a
medium
roasty
and
hop
bitterness
on
the
palate
with
each
sip
this
beer
has
a
lower
level
of
carbonation
with
a
slightly
crisp
mouthfeel
overall
this
is
a
pretty
good
beer
but
i
prefer
the
way
it
smells
over
the
way
it
tastes
doa
overall
an
easy
to
drink
dark
lager
but
the
flavor
profile
is
a
bit
mild
a
refreshing
twist
to
the
dark
lager
style
at
the
very
least
its
a
good
malt
option
for
those
who
are
bured
from
hops
i
dont
understand
the
packaging
here
this
beer
is
made
by
putting
redhot
chunks
of
granite
into
the
wort
this
is
how
some
oldschool
germans
boiled
their
wort
and
it
lends
the
beer
a
hearty
rich
cookedsugar
complexity
that
is
entirely
unique
if
the
earth
were
a
beer
this
is
what
it
would
taste
like
this
deep
winter
euro
dark
lager
stein
beer
screams
of
its
german
ancestry
so
why
put
it
in
a
bottle
with
little
hawaiian
guys
dancing
around
a
fire
on
the
label
beats
me
hand
me
another
surprisingly
chocolaty
but
you
can
definitely
taste
the
granite
a
really
unique
taste
flavors
blend
together
well
toasted
malta
touch
of
caramel
chocolate
and
a
mineral
like
quality
the
granite
really
adds
a
unique
quality
to
this
dark
lager
somehow
makes
it
taste
cleaner
and
crisper
a
strange
beer
for
sure
but
overall
its
pretty
good
a
little
boring
and
a
little
too
malt
heavy
at
times
though
a
good
dark
lager
decently
balanced
for
flavor
smooth
and
easy
drinking
o
i
really
wasnt
sure
what
effect
the
hot
rocks
using
hot
rocks
to
achieve
the
boil
method
they
used
would
have
maybe
thats
where
the
roasty
flavors
come
from
or
as
the
label
hints
it
was
just
fun
to
do
either
way
while
its
nothing
earth
shatteringly
different
i
really
enjoyed
this
beer
and
will
be
putting
it
in
the
regular
rotation
pours
a
dark
semitransparent
cola
brown
with
a
very
thick
but
not
too
persistent
light
tan
head
the
sample
i
got
fizzed
like
nobodys
business
so
you
may
want
to
have
a
towel
handy
malty
aroma
has
a
firm
fruity
note
and
just
a
hint
of
miso
flavor
has
a
malty
core
plus
fruity
and
woody
notes
and
just
a
touch
of
caramel
there
also
seems
to
be
a
dusty
or
dirty
tone
perhaps
from
the
rocks
used
to
heat
the
wort
smooth
texture
has
good
body
and
a
fair
amount
of
fizz
overall
a
very
tasty
dark
lager
with
a
nice
bright
and
dark
flavor
on
draft
and
very
drinkable
which
is
why
i
bought
a
growler
after
tasting
it
on
draft
d
very
drinkable
feels
smooth
with
a
nice
roasted
dryness
that
balanced
the
hop
and
other
flavors
nicely
bomber
poured
into
a
pint
glass
dark
copper
color
with
a
tan
head
aroma
is
full
of
caramel
and
dark
fruits
specifically
the
dank
odor
of
prunes
and
the
sweetness
of
figs
flavor
is
very
similar
pungent
dark
fruits
and
a
light
toffee
finish
this
is
a
fullflavored
lager
that
can
hold
my
attention
but
unfortunately
the
sweet
prune
combo
is
a
little
much
to
deal
with
over
the
course
of
22
ounces
c
final
thought
this
is
a
very
very
nicely
crafted
lager
5
a
pop
6
and
just
all
around
awesome
o
wow
not
what
i
was
expecting
in
a
lager
lagers
are
not
my
favorite
style
so
i
am
pleasantly
surprised
well
done
o
got
to
admit
i
was
expecting
something
a
little
lighter
when
i
purchased
this
bottle
and
not
that
this
is
a
bad
beer
but
the
plan
was
to
pair
this
with
japanese
food
and
this
just
didnt
work
with
it
now
i
understand
that
isnt
the
beers
fault
but
it
is
what
it
is
otherwise
a
decent
brew
with
lots
of
malty
characteristics
and
a
fair
drinkability
the
appearance
of
the
hot
rocks
lager
is
great
the
beer
poured
a
ddep
rich
amber
that
was
nearly
opaque
a
huge
froathy
offwhite
head
formed
and
is
lacing
down
on
the
glass
the
aroma
carried
caramel
malt
and
slight
spice
the
taste
starts
with
a
sweet
malt
then
becomes
dry
on
the
pallet
the
mouthfeel
is
good
medium
body
big
carbonation
which
i
think
affects
the
taste
slightly
overall
this
is
a
good
beer
o
a
very
nice
beer
i
dig
that
this
was
a
collaboration
with
some
brewery
ive
never
heard
of
even
still
i
like
the
experiment
in
using
dark
granite
rocks
to
help
heat
the
wort
and
give
some
nice
offkilter
flavors
think
the
process
produced
some
nicely
done
caramelized
almost
decoctionlike
qualities
really
glad
to
have
tried
this
more
complex
than
you
think
and
expect
a
very
nice
lager
fairly
dry
heavy
side
of
light
lively
carbonation
drinks
easy
i
just
realy
dont
think
i
would
visit
it
again
even
with
the
higher
scores
but
thats
how
i
feel
about
the
style
in
general
o
probably
the
best
lager
ive
had
from
the
west
coast
i
am
an
ale
sort
of
person
but
definitely
not
opposed
to
lagers
i
just
normally
drink
ales
in
a
very
good
way
this
beer
reminds
me
of
a
delicious
brown
ale
o
really
impressed
with
this
beer
for
the
abv
and
lager
style
it
has
the
depth
of
flavor
of
a
stronger
porter
or
stout
this
would
be
an
excellent
christmascold
weather
beer
you
should
try
this
great
stuff
bright
and
ballsy
malt
profile
with
plenty
of
added
intrigue
from
the
hot
rocks
pours
a
thick
murky
brown
hue
with
dark
copper
highlights
and
leaves
a
bubble
laden
two
finger
head
that
settles
to
an
outer
rimthe
smell
is
steamcaramelfruity
hops
and
toffee
fonduethe
mouthfeel
is
spot
on
for
a
lager
its
light
bodied
but
the
difference
setting
it
apart
from
other
lagers
is
this
light
body
has
abit
of
backbone
which
carries
the
tastes
nicely
of
sticky
caramelburnt
toffeeraspberriespoached
fruit
and
finishes
pretty
much
like
a
milky
bitter
white
coffee
that
you
have
been
waiting
for
ages
to
cool
down
and
is
ready
for
sculling
and
overall
im
a
big
fan
of
this
brew
as
you
dont
see
the
hot
rock
method
used
too
much
these
days
and
compared
to
one
of
our
local
australian
micro
breweries
that
brews
a
brew
using
the
similar
style
this
one
is
far
superior
and
my
only
complaint
is
that
i
probably
will
not
see
this
again
for
a
while
and
am
looking
forwards
to
seeing
it
again
one
day
cheers
a
treat
a
lager
with
a
lot
of
flavor
but
still
very
sesionable
could
drink
a
ton
of
this
o
a
really
enjoyable
brew
with
a
very
alelike
presence
and
big
malty
flavor
that
surpasses
any
schwarzbier
ive
had
before
great
job
port
overall
looks
good
smells
good
taste
good
feels
good
but
nothing
spectacular
very
affordable
at

99
a
bomber
a
great
lager
seriously
a
must
try
for
those
who
appreciate
lagers
o
for
a
beer
that
looks
like
i
just
poured
a
coke
once
a
lot
of
the
carbonation
burned
off
this
beer
was
pretty
drinkable
interesting
flavors
but
i
wasnt
blow
away
huh
im
surprised
ba
doesnt
have
a
style
category
for
steinbier
though
i
think
this
i
only
the
second
example
ive
tried
of
the
style
the
first
being
a
ceramic
bottle
with
a
grolschtype
lid
from
germany
that
was
very
flat
and
not
very
good
this
one
is
alright
tmo
really
nice
sweet
bready
malt
flavor
melded
nicely
with
hints
of
raisins
and
plum
sourness
is
not
there
at
all
id
be
concerned
of
sour
flavor
of
this
beer
being
bad
but
really
was
only
present
in
the
aroma
mouthful
was
slightly
chewy
flavor
lingered
nicely
and
dissipated
just
in
time
to
want
to
take
another
sip
has
a
slight
warming
effect
abv
at
6
5
just
low
enough
i
believe
to
be
sessionable
but
on
the
low
end
usually
i
find
any
lager
to
be
very
filling
but
this
one
wasnt
to
bad
this
isnt
your
typical
strait
forward
lager
either
it
definiently
has
character
id
recommend
it
for
sure
although
id
probably
go
for
there
ipa
thats
just
my
style
preference
pours
a
dark
nearly
opaque
brown
a
bit
reddish
on
the
edges
with
decent
offqhite
head
that
dies
to
a
decent
film
laces
ok
enough
aromas
are
a
bit
of
a
sweet
maltiness
a
touch
of
brown
sugar
and
light
caramel
candies
bit
of
toast
and
nuts
coupled
with
faint
vanilla
sweetness
and
chocolate
more
on
the
softer
side
than
bitter
initial
is
decent
bodied
toasty
and
smoothed
out
with
a
nice
creaminess
vanilla
chocolate
caramel
and
a
good
nuttiness
round
out
the
base
flavors
moving
to
a
light
brown
sugar
touch
of
roast
and
decent
bitterness
on
the
backend
the
roast
and
bitterness
stay
on
the
palate
well
as
this
beer
should
be
a
bit
lighter
than
expected
but
still
packs
pretty
good
flavor
for
just
a
dunkel
the
sweetness
isnt
cloying
as
roast
and
toast
with
pretty
good
hoppiness
come
in
to
balance
i
liked
this
beer
for
what
it
was
and
only
qualm
may
have
been
that
the
bitterness
and
roast
on
the
finish
although
enjoyable
could
have
been
smoothed
out
a
bit
for
a
more
sessionable
experience
o
interesting
lager
with
a
nice
array
of
malty
flavors
it
is
rich
while
still
being
light
bodied
at
the
same
time
pours
a
hazy
deep
amber
color
with
a
light
tan
head
in
the
aroma
small
fruit
charcoal
and
some
small
smoke
in
the
taste
small
sweet
fruit
dry
rocks
and
a
hint
of
smoke
a
small
bite
and
medium
to
lighter
bodied
mouthfeel
with
a
dry
hint
of
smoke
almost
like
a
rauch
and
quite
grill
like
overall
i
dig
hot
rocks
for
its
combination
of
toasty
sweet
and
smokey
reminds
me
of
a
kostritzer
with
a
tinge
of
rauchbier
i
cant
say
its
smooth
its
not
but
it
is
flavorful
and
pairing
well
with
the
seasoned
hamburger
and
noodles
in
gravy
im
eating
with
it
due
to
its
more
abrasive
effect
on
the
palate
one
per
sitting
is
all
i
need
very
smooth
and
easy
to
drink
very
well
crafted
lager
at
499
22oz
i
will
certainly
seek
this
out
in
the
future
o
another
solid
beer
from
port
brewing
very
flavorful
for
such
a
clean
drinkable
beer
hot
rocks
lager
is
a
decent
lager
and
another
great
choice
from
what
im
realizing
must
be
a
fantastic
brewery
o
an
interesting
beer
that
reminds
me
very
much
of
a
schwartzbeer
ill
probably
try
this
again
if
it
is
a
yearly
release
i
tried
this
a
couple
of
months
ago
but
it
was
a
year
old
bottle
i
like
this
one
better
feels
more
balanced
bottled

pours
a
dark
brown
color
with
a
large
creamtan
colored
head
that
goes
down
rather
slowly
scent
is
extremely
malty
with
hints
of
chocolate
and
roasted
nuts
hints
of
vanilla
as
well
taste
is
initially
very
malty
with
some
roasted
chocolate
flavors
there
is
a
bit
of
burnt
nuttiness
along
with
bread
and
dark
fruits
i
find
this
beer
to
be
very
tasty
mouthfeel
is
pretty
fullbodied
and
wellcarbonated
leaves
a
bubbling
sensation
in
the
mouth
and
has
a
very
smooth
crisp
finish
drinkability
is
high
overall
this
is
a
fantastic
dark
lager
that
i
would
definitely
purchase
again
drink
i
thought
this
was
pretty
good
i
like
the
dark
lager
aspect
to
it
with
some
malts
sweetness
and
a
little
yeast
in
the
profile
probably
wont
have
again
but
still
pretty
good
taste
is
fairly
bitter
and
sharp
theres
a
lot
of
coffee
and
almost
tart
flavors
from
the
toasty
roasty
flavors
unique
but
good
a
heavy
and
thick
lager
more
reminiscent
of
a
porter
than
anything
else
earthy
and
roasty
lots
of
flavor
and
perfect
with
food
good
enough
for
a
second
pint
especially
at
3
drinkable
thats
its
best
attribute
its
not
a
particularly
captivating
beer
although
i
like
the
concept
of
the
way
it
was
brewed
perhaps
they
could
have
produced
a
more
interesting
result
however
o
i
enjoyed
the
little
story
behind
the
beer
on
the
bottle
it
actually
turned
out
quite
nice
light
yet
full
and
warming
its
odd
it
seems
a
perfect
accompaniment
to
a
cool
summer
meal
or
a
warm
winters
feast
a
very
nice
balance
i
enjoyed
this
greatly
not
a
bad
beer
at
all
not
a
bad
rich
flavor
but
not
much
for
drinking
a
pint
o
this
is
tasty
and
is
the
easiest
finishing
bomber
ive
ever
had
this
isnt
mindblowing
in
the
taste
category
but
goes
down
easily
enough
good
stuff
reminds
me
a
lot
of
a
brown
ale
in
some
ways
very
tasty
and
another
great
brew
from
port
who
has
yet
to
disappoint
plenty
drinkable
this
is
a
smooth
and
tasty
beer
overall
an
interesting
lager

a

of
roast
some
grainy
sourness

not
too
sour
just
a
hint
of
sour
although
not
very
complex
certainly
quite
tasty
and
super
drinkable
my
favorite
dunkel
thus
far
drinkability
is
also
good
this
is
a
pretty
tasty
lager
id
happily
have
another
nice

of
chocolate
malt
and
bittering
hop
peppery
the
body
is

the
finish
is
interesting
as
it
mostly
dark

not
hoppy
the
aftertaste
is
muted
but
lasting
similar
to
drinking
hot

a
smooth

thin

perhaps
its
just
so
smooth

definite

points
for

4
and
for
the
uniqueness
of
this
beer
i
thought
this
beer
was
okay
nothing
extraordinary
being
brewed
with
hot
rocks
in
the
process
i
wouldnt
pass
it
down
if
offered
as
a
sidenote
this
beer
had
a
ton
of
sediment
in
the
bottle
luckily
very
little
of
it
came
out
most
had
partially
solidified
at
the
bottom
maybe
that
bottle
conditioning
gave
it
that
perfect
head
all
in
all
a
good
dark
lager
that
is
easy
to
drink
and
i
would
love
to
have
again
d
this
beer
is
very
dry
with
the
melanoidinnougat
flavor
grown
and
just
the
hop
bitterness
to
follow
it
would
be
nice
if
there
was
more
caramel
flavors
form
the
lava
rocks
to
add
some
depth
and
flavor
drinkability
for
a
lager
seemed
a
bit
rough
no
signs
of
abv
though
d
this
is
a
pretty
interesting
beer
that
im
enjoying
quite
a
bit
it
has
a
good
taste
but
i
think
one
or
two
in
a
sitting
is
enough
for
me
worth
trying
sometime
the
technique
doesnt
produce
as
distinct
a
beer
as
it
seems
it
would
but
it
does
result
in
the
hands
of
these
two
capable
brewers
at
least
in
a
notably
flavourful
and
superbly
drinkable
lager
too
bad
this
beer
itself
is
nearly
as
rare
as
the
brewing
methods
used
to
make
it
i
could
see
enjoying
a
good
many
of
these
if
it
were
regularly
accessible
dpretty
easy
drinking
for
something
so
reminiscent
of
a
dopplebock
but
as
with
those
beers
the
richness
catches
up
with
you
after
awhile
the
ever
creative
port
brewing
nails
it
again
a
generally
subtle
style
with
a
slight
spin
and
it
makes
this
brew
exciting
hunt
this
one
down
md
medium
body
lots
of
carbonation
that
help
bring
out
the
flavors
finishes
just
a
tad
on
the
sweet
side
from
the
grains
very
drinkable
because
of
the
taste
is
refreshing
and
doesnt
dry
out
the
palate
also
the
low
alcohol
level
allow
for
good
drinkability
quite
complex
over
the
course
of
the
tasting
worth
a
second
try
looking
forward
to
comparing
it
to
the
original
theres
a
metallic
roughness
to
the
flavor
thats
supported
by
toasted
and
caramelized
malt
light
roastiness
hints
of
coffee
and
fruitiness
its
rather
fullbodied
and
rich
making
it
not
exactly
sessionable
but
certainly
enjoyable
and
easy
enough
to
drink
a
pint
of
its
nice
to
see
new
breweries
using
traditional
arguably
archaic
brewing
methods
such
as
this
i
dont
think
ive
had
another
stone
beer
beyond
this
one
but
id
love
to
try
more
d
overall
its
a
pretty
good
offering
from
port
brewing
drinks
well
but
it
reminds
me
of
an
amber
ale
drinkability
this
is
a
strange
one
that
youll
love
or
hate
i
enjoyed
the
uniqueness
of
this
effort
and
especially
appreciated
the
expert
lagering
that
went
into
the
storage
process
i
dont
know
if
it
was
the
granite
or
whatever
but
this
had
that
musty
character
like
it
was
aged
in
a
damp
cave
something
almost
impossible
to
find
outside
of
germany
i
like
the
novelty
of
this
although
youd
never
know
it
was
brewed
using
black
granite
if
you
werent
1
told
so
or
2
an
expert
on
black
granite
as
is
its
a
refreshing
dark
lager
that
elbows
into
bock
territory
flavorwise
although
not
really
texturally
all
i
know
is
the
flavor
is
the
best
thing
about
it
which
is
pretty
much
95
of
the
reason
i
drink
beer
and
i
was
left
wanting
more
of
the
same
after
this
bomber
was
gone
drinks
pretty
easy
not
perfect
but
right
in
my
maltcentric
wheelhouse
i
wonder
if
these
guys
will
do
rauch
or

they
might
want
to
give
it
some
serious
thought
poured
its
cherry
coke
lookin
self
into
my
zatec
fluted
glass
a
finger
of
lagerish
foamy
head
smells
a
bit
nutty
a
bit
cocoay
and
a
bit
toastedy
dry
bockish
taste
highly
carbonated
with
a
very
dry
cocoa
powder
light
coffee
and
toasted
flavor
not
my
favorite
port
brew
but
for
style
its
pretty
tasty
i
could
go
for
a
couple
more
pours
a
dark
cherry
cola
color
with
red
hues
and
a
full
finger
foamy
tan
head
that
fades
with
stringy
patterns
of
belgian
lacing
behind
the
smell
is
sweet
and
spicy
with
a
toasted
malty
character
really
significant
cinnamon
notes
medium
bodied
mouth
feel
nicely
carbonated
and
creamy
smooth
the
texture
compliments
the
rich

this
one
is
a
easy
drinking
keeper
recommended
drinkability
a
lot
of
malty
flavor
like
a
big
dunkel
but
a
nicely
balanced
hop
profile
too
d
tasty
goes
down
easily
not
too
filling
decent
kick
different
representation
of
style
this
is
a
solid
beer
to
drink
if
youre
looking
for
a
poundable
darker
beer
that
is
different
from
your
typical
stout
or
porter
overall
this
was
a
rather
uninteresting
beer
it
is
ok
not
true
to
style
at
all
but
not
bad
dnice
stuff
crisp
and
dry
with
good
flavours
overall
in
this
interestingly
created
brew
a
well
done
lager
from
the
ipa
and
wild
beer
masters
liked
this
beer
a
lot
improved
as
it
warmed
the
last
few
sips
were
the
best
need
to
get
back
to
philly
and
get
another
bottle
overall
this
was
a
really
intresting
beer
and
not
at
all
what
i
was
expecting
found
a
bottle
of
this
last
spring
at
by
the
bottle
in
vancouver
wa
the
colour
was
a
garnetbrown
and
had
about
a
14
inch
head
the
aroma
was
malty
and
sweet
with
some
biscuit
but
no
other
standout
smells
on
the
palate
there
was
burnt
malt
light
smoke
some
brown
sugar
and
some
bitterness
around
the
back
of
my
palate
the
finish
was
sweetly
malty
but
not
overtly
so
22oz
bottle
picked
up
down
in
oc
this
was
an
interesting
beer
i
went
into
this
not
really
knowing
what
to
expect
from
it
very
malty
overall
with
a
rich
sweetness
that
makes
it
drink
like
a
bigger
bock
beer
than
it
is
i
would
almost
call
it
a
doppelbock
in
the
malt
department
but
the
steinbier
thing
has
given
it
a
malt
profile
that
is
truly
unique
and
intriguing
dark
redbrown
in
color
with
a
thick
light
beige
head
that
leaves
a
lasting
slick
after
a
few
minutes
the
aroma
is
sweet
and
malty
with
a
smooth
lager
character
caramel
burnt
sugars
licorice
and
light
smoke
the
flavor
is
squarely
malt
driven
and
sweet
with
caramel
some
chocolate
burnt
marshmallows
dried
fruit
light
smoke
and
a
light
spicy
hop
bitterness
mediumfull
bodied
with
mediumlow
carbonation
i
liked
this
beer
because
of
the
cool
malty
flavors
but
couldnt
help
but
with
it
was
a
little
drier
or
hoppier
for
balance
by
the
end
of
the
bomber
the
sweetness
became
a
little
too
intense
drinkability
really
nice
and
very
drinkable
seems
a
pretty
unique
style
people
should
make
more
i
had
high
hopes
for
hot
rocks
perhaps
too
high
i
like
collaboration
beers
and
this
effort
by
port
and
bend
brewing
has
an
interesting
story
read
the
label
if
youre
interested
i
wont
rehash
it
here
the
results
are
alright
but
arent
spectacular
it
just
doesnt
have
any
standout
qualities
that
make
it
shine
its
alright
and
is
definitely
worth
a
try
but
go
for
the
single
bomber
you
can
thank
me
later
a
dark
brown
beer
poured
into
a
pint
glass
the
first
smell
is
of
a
malty
sweetness
that
smells
very
inviting
the
taste
is
different
than
the
smell
with
chocolate
and
roasted
grains
being
the
predominant
flavor
there
is
not
a
lot
of
carbonation
which
is
okay
in
this
beer
overall
this
is
a
very
drinkable
beer
that
would
go
very
well
with
a
hamburger
or
a
steak
d
easy
to
drink
but
not
that
impressive
and
in
all
reality
tastes
a
lot
more
like
a
porter
or
a
stout
than
a
lager
really
not
that
impressed
with
this
beer
just
doesnt
really
do
anything
for
me
some
nice
flavors
but
has
some
off
maybe
a
little
green
flavors
very
cool
collaboration
but
the
end
product
just
didnt
do
it
for
me
d
interesting
flavor
combinations
but
lacks
any
outstanding
charachter
this
is
a
fine
beer
but
not
really
doing
it
for
me
more
roast
and
malt
than
i
was
expecting
eh
a
fun
beer
to
try
with
a
these
days
rather
unique
brewing
process
but
it
is
not
that
great
a
beer
to
really
enjoy
at
least
not
for
me
the
flavor
is
very
strange
and
a
bit
too
bitter
and
herbal
for
me
in
a
dark
lager
like
this
overall
more
of
a
dunkel
than
a
red
ale
light
to
medium
bodied
highly
drinkable
but
slightly
undercarbonated
for
the
novelty
alone
this
is
worth
checking
out
since
it
is
a
collaborated
effort
and
they
did
heat
the
wort
with
hot
rocks
mouthfeel
was
slightly
thin
drinkability
was
great
but
its
not
a
session
beer
a
nice
lager
but
i
think
im
more
in
love
with
the
way
it
was
brewed
than
how
it
tasted
poured
into
an
imperial
pint
glass
formed
a
12
tan
head
over
the
clear
reddish
brown
brew
head
recedes
gradually
to
a
slight
layer
of
froth
with
average
lacing
aroma
is
deeply
of
rich
malt
reminiscent
of
a
black
lager
but
dialed
back
a
bit
taste
mirrors
the
nose
maybe
the
second
runnings
of
a
schwartzbier
chewy
sweetness
upfront
peeks
of
crisp
hoppiness
to
close
mouthfeel
is
good
and
drinkability
is
nice
and
easy
one
i
would
definitely
look
for
again
the
process
by
which
hot
rocks
lager
was
brewed
is
more
interesting
than
the
beer
itself
that
said
this
is
a
pretty
enjoyable
schwarzbier
that
is
a
few
more
flavor
facets
away
from
being
worthy
of
a
repeat
purchase
if
its
ever
released
again
that
is
10
oz
pour
at
the
brickskellar
dc
drinkability
high
not
including
bamberg
germany
im
not
much
of
a
lager
fan
if
forced
to
drink
one
i
would
probably
choose
this
but
there
just
isnt
a
whole
lot
going
on
im
glad
i
tried
it
but
im
sorry
to
say
i
wont
be
having
an
other
anytime
soon
d
an
easy
to
drink
brew
just
nothing
that
really
stands
out
for
me
pours
a
coppery
brown
color
with
2
fingers
of
khaki
tan
head
into
a
pint
glass
ok
retention
and
some
spotty
lacing
smells
of
roasted
malt
chocolate
molasses
cinnamon
and
some
floral
hops
tastes
of
chocolate
molasses
cinnamon
nuts
roasted
malt
coffee
smooke
and
light
citrus
medium
in
body
with
good
carbonation
smooth
with
a
light
bitter
finish
easy
to
drink
nice
and
roasty
overall
id
like
to
taste
more
beers
that
actively
use
rocks
in
the
brewing
process
as
the
two
ive
had
definitely
change
the
flavor
profile
definitely
worth
a
shot
d
easy
to
drink
great
darker
lager
but
it
doesnt
seem
to
have
much
direction
pours
a
dark
mahogany
with
a
thick
tan
head
looks
opaque
until
held
up
to
the
light
thick
lacking
burnt
sugar
and
roasted
malt
aroma
some
caramelmolasses
aroma
as
well
toasty
heavier
mouthfeel
than
expected
somewhat
syrupy
with
a
long
finish
not
the
taste
i
was
expecting
none
of
that
sweet
lagery
nonsense
grainy
and
minerals
with
a
strong
malt
character
balanced
well
with
spicy
hops
finish
is
also
spicy
but
sweeter
with
the
maple
syrup
everyone
reports
very
roasty
throughout
it
tricks
you
into
thinking
its
coffee
but
my
guess
is
that
its
from
the
burnt
grain
and
malt
from
the
superheated
granite
loved
this
beer
mfd
has
a
fullness
to
the
body
that
i
really
like
although
its
not
a
very
complex
brew
im
finding
it
highly
drinkable
not
bad
tasting
at
all
but
doesnt
really
taste
like
a
lager
ends
up
tasting
like
a
stout
d
very
drinkable
beer
but
maybe
this
type
of
beer
isnt
my
thing
but
i
expected
more
from
port
d
big
malty
lager
with
a
spicy
flair
port
always
brews
a
quality
beer
and
this
is
no
exception
cheers
definitely
worth
a
try
in
the
end
this
is
quite
malt
focused
even
if
i
cant
quite
decide
if
the
initial
hop
focus
in
the
flavor
was
distracting
or
intriguing
this
is
quite
a
tasty
beer
and
the
unique
notes
presumably
from
the
stoning
process
makes
this
that
much
more
interesting
to
try
drinkability
intensely
drinkable
could
knock
them
back
all
day
abv
is
no
where
to
be
found
d
a
great
lager
but
this
is
sort
of
too
much
for
me
so
there
is
no
way
id
drink
more
than
1
d
not
overly
complex
overt
in
toasted
malt
charachter
easy
enough
to
drink
or
sip
this
very
dark
deep
amber
colored
beer
poured
out
with
a
good
amount
of
lacing
that
retreated
to
wisps
of
lacing
the
beer
smelled
of
good
balance
of
hops
and
malt
with
the
aroma
of
a
good
roast
the
caramel
and
chocolate
gave
hints
to
a
fig
like
taste
overall
this
beer
was
a
roasted
dry
excellent
light
porter
which
is
a
lager
strange
but
an
excellent
beer
overall
somewhat
drinkable
the
strength
of
the
brew
should
spit
out
an
unnoticeable
8
0
alc
by
vol
but
doesnt
bit
sweet
but
overall
very
good
d
pretty
nice
easy
enough
to
drink
always
cool
to
see
two
brewers
collaborate
and
try
using
a
technique
not
commonly
used
i
would
prefer
even
more
hops
in
this
one
all
the
malt
flavor
makes
me
want
to
go
for
something
else
but
for
4
00
i
am
not
going
to
complain
tasty
sweet
nutty
toasty
quality
comes
out
in
this
biznatch
its
a
nutty
of
an
o
is
hot
rocks
lager0
but
i
am
good
for
1
or
2
bombers
worth
if
the
mood
is
right
drinkability
was
impressed
by
this
one
i
like
the
flavors
and
mouthfeel
and
found
it
very
drinkable
interesting
take
on
the
steinbier
always
good
to
see
invention
alive
and
well
cool
beer
that
tastes
pretty
good
pours
cola
colored
brown
with
small
head
that
disappears
completely
within
moments
nose
is
weak
to
nonexistent
with
a
suggestion
of
musty
caramel
palate
has
an
earthy
quality
that
is
probably
the
rock
influence
but
beyond
that
its
just
a
light
roasty
malt
flavor
profile
its
watery
with
not
much
exciting
going
on
this
is
the
first
beer
ive
had
that
took
the
stein
bier
concept
quite
literally
and
i
like
it
a
lot
smooth
like
a
lager
should
be
yet
nice
and
sweet
in
its
own
right
i
would
love
to
see
more
brewers
take
a
crack
at
this
style
definite
thumbs
up
from
me
good
work
on
this
beer
with
all
the
problems
the
lost
abbey
has
been
having
lately
its
good
to
see
that
quality
control
issues
aside
they
still
put
together
fantastic
recipes
no
significant
problems
with
this
beer
id
love
to
see
this
become
a
regular
beer
in
the
port
lineup
as
opposed
to
a
oneoff
it
is
always
nice
to
see
something
new
from
port
on
the
shelf
this
bomber
was
bought
at
liquor
world
in
cambridge
for
six
bucks
i
was
surprised
when
i
started
pouring
in
that
this
beer
is
a
lot
darker
than
i
was
expecting
it
has
a
colaroot
beer
look
to
it
and
a
creamy
white
heading
one
of
the
best
looking
beers
i
have
encountered
in
a
while
nose
has
some
malted
milk
balls
chocolate
bit
of
rye
and
toasted
bread
more
of
the
same
comes
from
the
taste
which
is
fine
as
all
the
flavors
really
work
well
in
unison
body
is
somewhere
in
the
middle
of
light
and
medium
while
it
is
an
easy
drinker
sometimes
the
sweetness
of
it
becomes
a
bit
much
still
let
this
one
unfold
and
you
will
see
that
there
are
multiple
layers
of
complexity
a
very
nice
beer
they
have
crafted
here
i
love
the
fact
that
they
brewed
this
style
which
i
rarely
try
im
a
lager
fan
and
happy
to
see
more
coming
from
our
leading
craft
breweries
this
ones
fine
but
nothing
to
get
too
excited
about
beef
up
the
carbonation
a
bit
get
a
bit
more
hop
bite
then
this
one
would
be
special
as
i
watch
the
bs
seal
the
game
1
deal
i
gotta
say
that
this
drinks
well
ill
leave
the
commentary
to
the
habs
antics
for
a
more
relevant
forum
this
drinks
very
nicely
and
is
enjoyable
as
hell
i
would
never
have
guessed
this
was
a
lager
very
unusual
beer
for
port
to
make
once
they
did
away
with
the
amigo
lager
i
thought
they
were
going
to
go
for
more
extreme
style
beers
pours
a
dark
brown
almost
black
color
with
almost
no
head
mostly
dark
malt
aroma
no
hop
aroma
whatsoever
the
taste
was
extremely
good
though
really
nice
carmalazation
not
roasty
but
malty
sweet
but
well
balanced
good
co2
a
very
good
example
of
a
german
schwarzbier
in
my
opinion
drinkability
fairly
enjoyable
its
definitely
good
to
see
someones
trying
to
bring
a
little
excitement
to
the
humble
sometimes
dull
lager
especially
when
its
in
the
form
of
broiled
hunks
of
granite
d
excellent
flavor
and
excellent
feel
this
is
a
solidly
enjoyably
ale
that
id
definitely
recommend
dark
brown
colored
beer
with
a
rapidly
fading
head
aroma
is
malty
with
a
hint
of
coffee
taste
also
is
coffeemaltssweet
cream
and
perhaps
a
pinch
of
chocolate
this
is
very
smooth
and
creamy
from
the
first
sip
to
last
gulp
i
would
recommend
and
purchase
again
d
nothing
crazy
here
but
a
nice
solid
stein
beer
that
i
could
session
i
dont
drink
a
lot
of
lagers
i
would
definetly
drink
this
one
again
cool
colaboration
i
would
like
to
see
the
process
of
making
this
beer
or
at
least
the
magma
think
austin
powers
here
part
cracked
open
a
bomber
and
poured
into
a
mug
lives
up
to
the
dark
lager
name
in
color
borders
on
dark
red
and
brown
and
has
a
thin
tan
head
sweet
malty
goodness
on
the
nose
mostly
caramel
and
molasses
the
same
sweetness
in
the
aroma
comes
through
in
the
taste
roasted
flavor
mixes
with
an
assortment
of
fruits
that
dont
seem
like
they
should
be
in
a
lager
regardless
still
very
good
reminds
me
more
of
a
brown
ale
although
it
resembles
a
lager
feel
on
the
finish
not
usually
a
style
i
go
with
but
overall
this
was
a
tasty
brew
also
interesting
to
try
out
a
beer
using
the
hot
rocks
method
as
explained
on
the
label
on
a
side
note
i
remember
a
brew
by
alesmith
and
tomme
arthur
and
another
port
brewer
bagby
or
nickels
i
think
that
used
this
same
method
for
brewing
using
with
the
hot
rocks
cant
quite
remember
the
name
of
that
brew
except
the
word
stone
or
stoned
was
in
it
cool
to
hear
tomme
collaborated
with
bend
brewing
on
this
and
also
the
whole
idea
of
this
brew
in
general
did
not
even
know
this
type
of
thing
was
done
will
be
drinking
again
recommended
quite
refreshing
i
enjoyed
it
d
not
a
bad
little
brew
out
of
port
glad
i
got
to
try
it
a
little
prickly
mediumlow
carbonation
on
the
tongue
and
some
body
a
little
harsh
in
the
finish
which
seems
to
be
from
a
combination
of
the
alcohol
and
grain
tannins
not
bad
but
the
finish
is
just
a
tad
harsh
a
little
smoother
as
it
warms
up
very
robust
and
flavorful
certainly
worth
a
try
overall
its
good
but
nothing
i
would
search
out
for
and
very
overpriced
all
in
all
good
and
interesting
as
ive
never
had
a
stein
beer
before
i
have
no
frame
of
reference
for
properly
rating
and
judging
this
but
it
did
taste
good
i
dont
drink
a
lot
of
lagers
im
really
only
so
so
on
double
bockseven
those
that
are
supposed
to
be
the
best
in
the
style
but
this
is
a
real
nice
beer
the
color
is
ruddy
brown
and
slightly
hazy
red
when
held
in
front
of
a
lightvery
pretty
the
smell
is
malty
the
mouthfeel
is
clean
and
crisp
lager
the
taste
is
also
clean
malty
slightly
nutty
with
a
detectable
toasty
backdrop
very
well
balanced
and
exceptionally
drinkable
good
beer
well
done
port
brewing
the
idea
that
this
was
brewed
using
hot
rocks
to
boil
the
wort
also
adds
serious
coolness
points
hot
rocks
is
pretty
damn
flavorful
for
a
lager
of
the
darker
persuasion
its
very
similar
to
a
schwarzbier
spotted
this
on
tap
at
the
toronado
last
night
i
asked
what
kind
of
beer
it
was
and
he
said
something
along
the
lines
of
not
sure
its
dark
i
think
its
a
rauchbier
well
i
love
rauchbiers
and
since
it
was
one
of
the
few
lines
going
id
never
tried
i
ordered
it
what
it
is
is
a
tasty
schwarzbier
with
a
hint
of
roastiness
from
the
malt
but
certainly
not
smokey
more
of
a
dark
muddy
brown
than
black
it
looks
smells
and
holds
its
own
certainly
has
some
punch
guessing
at
least
6
abv
quite
worthwhile
trying
though
not
my
new
favorite
at
least
after
just
one
go
d
its
a
bit
big
for
a
euro
lager
im
really
nitpicking
here
but
i
expected
something
that
was
a
bit
more
sessionable
i
would
definitely
have
another
glass
if
i
see
it
again
tan
onefinger
quickly
dissipating
head
over
dark
almost
opaque
brown
body
with
a
fair
bit
of
lacing
sweetish
caramel
and
b
and
m
baked
brown
bread
in
the
nose
and
a
slightly
sweetish
malt
taste
not
overly
hoppy
but
there
is
enough
presence
in
the
nose
and
taste
to
make
this
one
drinkable
lager
for
the
hopheads
among
us
very
tasty
and
a
much
needed
lagerlicous
deviation
from
ale
madness
lets
hope
tomme
and
tonya
get
together
again
soon
this
was
quite
the
tasty
lager
with
a
deep
tangy
feel
to
it
and
a
solid
drinkibility
that
worked
for
me
good
stuff
and
its
nice
to
see
another
lager
beer
coming
out
of
port
brewing
not
going
to
get
into
aroma
i
love
lagers
but
i
dont
find
them
to
be
nose
pleasers
per
say
off
white
head
holds
on
nicely
throughout
the
glass
especially
against
the
dark
base
tried
to
get
a
decent
pic
of
the
pretty
deep
brown
color
the
roasted
malt
comes
through
though
not
to
the
extent
the
color
would
lead
you
to
believe
also
a
surprisingly
faint
coffee
taste
along
with
almost
a
nutty
flavor
going
to
look
through
reviews
and
see
if
anyone
else
gets
that
sort
of
a
dark
lagerbrown
ale
combo
off
the
top
of
my
head
i
think
it
is
a
better
version
of
a
becks
dark
this
is
where
it
gets
interesting
i
had
to
use
a
spoon
to
get
some
of
the
head
out
of
the
glass
to
pour
the
rest
the
taste
was
okay
nothing
special
but
like
i
said
i
think
this
was
a
bad
bottle
i
will
find
this
again
and
give
it
a
fair
shot
the
mouth
feel
is
foamy
too
foamy
still
it
was
an
experience
just
one
i
dont
care
to
repeat
o
not
bad
but
not
up
with
for
example
better
czech
versions
the
beer
pours
a
dark
dull
amber
with
a
razor
thin
head
that
doesnt
lace
the
nose
has
a
grain
sweetness
notes
of
coffee
and
roast
but
not
much
else
it
drinks
with
a
grainforward
sweetness
with
a
touch
of
fruit
and
caramel
but
very
little
bitterness
the
mouthfeel
presents
a
lingering
grain
sweetness
good
carbonation
a
mild
reinforcing
roast
touch
of
chocolate
and
a
little
bitterness
this
is
a
decent
beer
but
absolutely
average
d
i
didnt
expect
much
from
this
one
but
im
pleasantly
surprised
a
tasty
flavorful
brew
that
i
could
definitely
drink
more
than
one
of
at
first
before
ive
identified
the
style
its
from
the
feel
that
i
definitely
notice
this
isnt
an
american
bruiser
of
any
kind
nor
is
it
in
porter
or
stout
territory
it
isnt
bland
though
and
its
crispness
and
moderate
carbonation
keep
it
going
while
it
doesnt
lack
smoothness
so
that
even
as
a
light
to
mediumbodied
dark
lager
it
works
its
medium
bodied
for
a
lager
and
once
again
its
the
best
lager
i
have
ever
had
from
any
brewery
thanks
chuck
o
a
very
flavorful
roasty
and
sweet
lager
that
drinks
like
a
milk
stoutporteroatmeal
stout
hybrid
great
creamy
mouthfeel
and
very
sessionable
this
would
be
a
staple
in
my
fridge
if
i
could
get
this
beer
around
cleveland
this
is
a
very
enjoyable
beer
it
had
very
little
head
or
lacing
in
a
pint
glass
smells
good
and
taste
improves
as
it
warms
a
bit
smooth
with
toasty
coffeelike
flavor
pairs
better
with
food
than
porter
but
has
a
flavor
that
is
similar
i
was
glad
to
discover
elevator
brewing
since
it
a
local
brewery
columbus
brewings
regular
offerings
are
good
but
more
for
hop
enthusiasts
the
smell
is
somewhat
subdued
but
a
little
sulfur
is
noticeable
at
the
fringe
with
a
little
bit
of
caramel
the
taste
is
similar
with
roasted
malts
caramel
and
a
tiny
amount
of
chocolate
maybe
even
vanilla
not
a
very
sweet
beer
at
all
but
thats
to
be
expected
overall
actually
one
of
the
best
dark
lagers
ive
had
extremely
sessionable
but
at
the
same
time
not
boring
would
love
to
get
my
hands
on
a
6pk
of
this
o
overall
i
would
definly
have
this
again
loved
it
and
all
i
tasted
there
overall
a
not
too
shabby
dark
larger
actually
contemplating
another
bottle
the
mouthfeel
is
a
little
thinner
than
i
expected
but
it
makes
it
easy
drinking
and
very
enjoyable
the
carbonation
is
just
right
with
a
slight
sting
on
the
palate
overall
this
is
an
easy
drinking
flavorful
lager
things
came
together
pretty
well
here
another
solid
offering
from
elevator
overy
good
beer
overall
it
has
great
color
and
taste
and
a
fairly
good
aroma
as
well
this
beer
is
definitely
one
that
you
can
drink
an
entire
6pack
of
on
a
hot
summer
day
overall
this
is
a
pretty
nice
brew
they
boast
on
the
label
that
it
won
a
bronze
medal
at
the
great
american
beer
festival
and
i
can
see
why
this
beer
poured
a
clear
very
dark
amber
color
and
formed
a
nice
foamy
light
tan
head
that
coated
the
glass
with
lace
as
it
subsided
an
aroma
of
malts
breads
and
lightly
of
chocolate
the
flavor
was
of
malt
chocolate
and
bread
the
body
is
fairly
light
and
the
finish
slightly
sweet
not
a
bad
beer
future
outlook
a
pleasant
easy
drinking
beer
but
not
really
in
line
with
my
preferences
and
not
something
i
will
likely
seek
out
in
the
future
lighter
body
but
not
overly
fizzy
alcohol
is
a
nonfactor
here
overall
not
terribly
interesting
but
without
any
major
flaws
this
would
be
easy
to
drink
a
lot
of
elevator
dark
horse
lager
is
solid
beer
from
the
gate
to
the
backstretch
to
the
finish
line
even
though
it
uses
lager
yeast
its
really
more
of
an
american
brown
ale
than
anything
else
forget
being
a
dark
horse
this
stuff
is
a
favorite
medium
bodied
with
modest
carbonation
for
a
brew
at
just
over
5
abv
the
alcohol
is
quite
pronounced
but
plays
off
with
a
nice
subtle
fruity
flavor
that
meshes
well
with
the
other
flavors
it
is
quite
drinkable
but
a
little
too
sweet
for
my
liking
and
at
times
the
buttery
notes
just
dont
blend
well
with
the
other
flavors
as
the
brew
warms
it
picks
up
a
bit
of
a
light
roasted
quality
about
the
malt
that
lingers
in
the
mouth
drinkability
is
good
slides
down
easy
and
has
enough
flavor
to
warrant
making
it
a
session
beer
medium
bodied
for
a
lager
slightly
dry
but
overall
a
very
smooth
and
easy
drinking
beer
i
am
slowly
becoming
sold
that
i
need
to
be
paying
more
attention
to
elevator
and
next
time
i
see
this
in
stores
ill
probably
come
home
with
some
this
is
good
dark
lager
try
it
not
too
shabby
dark
horse
is
straightforward
plays
it
safe
certainly
nothing
wrong
with
that
still
with
other
quality
beers
available
locally
from
elevator
others
this
wont
end
up
in
any
sort
of
regular
rotation
pours
a
clear
dark
brown
color
with
a
faint
head
that
gives
way
to
very
little
lacing
the
aroma
is
nice
a
caramel
malt
with
some
breadiness
and
some
biscuit
present
the
taste
is
of
a
caramel
malt
backbone
with
a
nice
taste
of
toast
and
biscuits
there
is
also
a
hint
of
dark
fruits
present
the
mouthfeel
is
overly
carbonated
it
is
a
little
too
much
going
on
in
the
mouth
the
drinkability
is
very
good
a
nice
smooth
flavor
with
a
nice
taste
there
is
a
nice
enough
balance
to
keep
you
wanting
more
the
mouthfeel
is
a
little
bit
distracting
though
note
the
beer
did
not
survive
this
review
d
this
is
an
easy
drinker
the
aromas
were
a
little
roasted
and
bready
yeast
it
was
very
light
and
subtle
basically
what
i
look
for
in
a
lager
when
it
comes
to
smell
the
flavor
was
roasted
and
sweet
at
the
same
time
it
was
crisp
and
light
in
the
mouth
with
good
carbonation
it
was
a
easy
brew
to
drink
and
was
looking
for
more
when
i
finished
it
d
pretty
sessionable
finishes
clean
and
dry
easy
to
drink
d
easy
drinker
for
sure
not
something
out
would
go
out
and
seek
but
then
again
i
wouldnt
turn
it
down
either
pours
a
transparent
dark
amber
almost
brown
color
less
than
a
12
finger
of
head
that
dissipates
to
a
then
film
almost
immediately
not
a
whole
lot
on
the
nose
a
hint
of
toasty
sweet
bread
the
taste
is
dominated
by
roasted
barley
and
a
bready
malt
backbone
a
little
sweetness
kicks
in
before
it
finishes
slight
bitter
and
dry
this
beer
has
the
crispness
you
expect
from
a
lager
while
providing
nice
roasted
characters
the
mouthfeel
is
quite
pleasant
as
well
an
overall
easy
drinking
and
enjoyable
brew
overall
a
nice
little
lager
i
have
to
say
not
the
biggest
fan
of
the
style
but
i
have
to
admit
this
kind
of
worked
for
me
i
would
have
no
issue
at
all
with
trying
this
one
again
any
day
this
was
decent
definitely
a
little
darker
tasting
than
you
would
expect
from
a
normal
lager
im
not
sure
how
old
this
bottle
was
but
it
seemed
to
have
a
bit
of
fade
on
it
id
like
to
rereview
in
the
future
with
a
fresher
sample
i
had
this
ontap
at
the
huntington
field
ballpark
in
columbus
while
i
was
pleased
to
find
an
alternative
to
bud
light
i
cant
say
this
beer
is
anything
to
get
too
excited
about
darkbrown
body
light
frothy
head
minimal
aroma
flavor
was
newcastleish
some
light
toffee
roastiness
accompanied
by
wateriness
not
bad
but
hardly
terrific
this
might
be
the
closest
to
style
beer
that
the
elevator
offers
if
compared
to
good
dunkels
cheers
to
session
beers
d
a
nice
drinkable
lager
the
first
dark
lager
i
think
ive
had
ill
definitely
try
this
one
again
thanks
to
csmiley
for
the
opportunity
to
sample
this
above
average
brew
gives
off
a
floral
smell
with
roasted
malt
character
not
quite
as
dark
as
the
name
suggests
but
does
taste
more
like
a
schwarzbier
than
a
lager
mouthfeel
is
average
and
is
on
par
with
redamber
lagers
with
a
bit
more

it

is
fair

the
well

of

definitely
pick
this
up
again
its
a
good
choice
and
the
first

is
selling
in
the
columbus
area
recommended
drinkability
very
smooth
will
be
revisited
in
the

certain

with
a
lingering

pretty
good
all
around
how
they
call
this
thing
a
black
lager
i
dont
understand
i
mean
while
that
might
be
true
of
this
it
is
certainly
a
whole
lot
more
than
that
and
to
call
it
that
is
a
major
understatement
more
than
dark
malt
and
lager
yeast
i
taste
blackberries
fresh
and
sweet
and
almost
jammy
if
thats
achieved
with
grain
alone
then
hats
off
to
you
moa
the
feel
is
also
different
for
the
declared
style
robust
in
both
body
and
carbonation
perhaps
a
product
of
the
bottle
fermentation
i
am
sick
of
hearing
people
bash
these
beers
and
watching
them
sit
on
shelves
they
are
splendid
especially
for
the
price
and
while
i
dont
love
this
as
much
as
their
breakfast
i
think
it
speaks
volumes
about
quality
and
uniqueness
of
this
brewing
culture
where
to
the
berries
come
from
and
all
the
body
while
still
being
low
alcohol
all
these
bubbles
make
it
sing
like
an
ale
yet
refresh
like
the
stated
lager
i
am
confused
but
happily
surprised
by
this
really
well
made
beer
that
stands
out
from
the
crowd
making
something
complex
out
of
something
simple
isnt
always
good
but
in
this
case
its
stupendous
brown
lager
euro
dark
lager
whatevs
this
sort
of
beer
is
already
borderline
in
terms
of
lack
of
sexiness
so
applying
a
yeasty
overly
carbonated
bottle
treatment
is
hardly
the
cure
lads
all
it
does
is
transfer
the
focus
of
banality
a
little
like
rearranging
lifeboats
on
the
titanic
not
worth
the
10
bones
this
goes
for
around
here
that
much
is
certain
food
match
would
suit
both
dessert
and
a
main
course
im
drinking
it
with
a
vegan
pie
that
has
ale
in
it
and
they
go
together
well
and
i
could
see
this
working
with
chargrilled
steaks
too
or
with
a
chocolate
tart
for
dessert
a
delightful
dark
lager
with
a
lightly
sweet
character
wellbalanced
with
roasted
grain
notes
and
a
decent
hop
bitterness
all
rolled
into
a
smooth
drinking
lager
beer
body
overall
not
very
good
the
aroma
isnt
too
bad
but
the
flavor
doesnt
really
do
well
too
many
bad
flavors
and
aromas
are
a
bit
meh
as
well
way
too
much
carbonation
not
very
drinkable
i
def
wont
finish
the
entire
750
by
myself
and
im
glad
it
was
cheap
o
while
this
beer
doesnt
have
the
strongest
aromas
and
flavors
it
definitely
makes
up
for
it
in
terms
of
drinkability
this
beer
goes
down
like
a
breeze
another
new
offering
for
me
from
these
guys
and
after
a
push
again
from
my
local
i
grabbed
as
i
gotta
admit
this
brewery
scares
me
at
times
anyway
it
pours
a
light
mahogany
hue
which
leaves
a
three
finger
khaki
creamy
head
and
similar
lacingthe
smell
is

a

its
alright

would

it
can
be
enjoyed
over
a
good

sure
overall
it

o
while
this

does
have
some
flaws
and
inconsistencies
it
is
still
very
easy
to
like
d
overall
this
is
a
very
interesting
beer
i
dont
think
ive
ever
smelled
or
tasted
anything
quite
like
it
interesting
doesnt
translate
into
outstanding
but
this
is
a
good
beer
and
i
will
probably
try
it
again

this
is
not

i
do
like
this
beer
very
refreshing

ma
dark
lager
no
really
if
i
hadnt
seen
the
label
id
think
this
was
a
dark
ale
from
the
uk
it
has
all
the
signature
citrus
and
slight
bitterness
of
an
epa
with
none
of
the
pithish
dry
bitterness
of
american
black
lagers
smooth
taste
thin
body
and
a
nice
malty
finish
make
this
an
easy
thing
to
drink
bonus
nice
curvy
bottle
shape
unusual
but
fits
well
in
your
hand
dont
drink
it
too
slowly
as
it
develops
a
somewhat
corny
smell
after
a
while
worth
seeking
out
overall
pretty
tasty
nothing
earthshattering
but
enjoyable
and
very
easy
drinking
more
intensity
would
improve
this
a
cheaper
price
would
too
5

makes
this
tough
to

i
liked
it
pours
a
slightly
hazy
warm
brown

not
persistent
pale

aroma
is
malty
and
just
slightly
nutty
not

but
still
inviting
flavor

malty
with
nutty
and
hoppy

not
wonderful
but
enjoyable
nevertheless
texture
is
smooth
and
fizzy
leaving
a

of
a
tingle
behind
along
with
a

d
nice

not

still
good
to
sit
down
with
a

it
werent
so
pricey
the
beer
pours
an
orangebrown
color
with
a
white

the
aroma
is
pretty
basic
with
toffee

the
flavor
is
more
of
the
same
lots
of
toffee
medium
mouthfeel
and
medium
carbonation
not
bad
but
nothing
specials
the
best
of
the
lot
from
the
three
moa
beers
i
tried
recently
much
better
than
the
original
lager
and
much
more
character
than
the
blanc
pours
dark
brown
almost
black
with
a
nice
robust
head
that
is
very
finely
beaded
and
pure
white
nice
smells
and
tastes
of
bitter
chocolate
not
at
all
sweet
overlay
the
deep
smooth
lager
undertones
and
there
are
some
nice
clean
earthy
notes
throughout
it
fades
a
little
as
it
warms
and
picks
up
just
a
touch
of
grainy
sourness
but
overall
a
very
pleasant
beer
i
will
say
that
the
beers
are
a
bit
confusing
with
names
like
noir
and
blanc
the
champagne
yeast
and
the
bottle
you
certainly
initially
expect
a
belgian
style
ale
not
a
lager
other
than
that
nice
to
see
another
craft
beer
from
down
under
moa
noir
is
to
new
zealand
as
eisenbahn
dunkel
is
to
brazil
none
of
the
three
moa
beers
ive
had
exceeded
5
5
abv
despite
that
all
three
including
this
have
been
good
to
me
moa
has
certainly
carved
itself
a
part
of
the
beer
market
most
breweries
of
its
generation
moa
was
founded
in
2003
have
shyed
away
from
d
i
didnt
want
this
bottle
to
end
very
impressive
when
i
swirled
the
yeast
and
poured
it
into
my
glass
i
picked
up
a
slight
belgian
dubbel
vibe
very
enjoyable
d
a
great
dark
lager
sweet
like
a
minidopplebock
glad
to
try
it
notes
a
decent
dark
lager
but
fairly
subtle
in
lots
of
ways
easy
to
drink
im
sure
this
is
a
crowd
pleaser
and
would
be
a
good
gateway
beer
for
some
who
says
they
dont
like
dark
beers
could
drink
quite
a
few
of
these
funny
looking

two
fingers
deep
and
dissolving
fast
viewing

from
the

outsides
big
bubbles
from
the
open

dense
microfoam
no
real
lacing
leaves
a
brown
cream
dusting
across
the
surface
very
clear
amber
brown
color
with
red
hues
the
transparency
is
almost
shocking
more
ochre
at
the
rims
creamy
but
not
necessarily
soft
nose
of
milk
chocolate
malt
cocoa
and
a
touch
of

nor
roasty

the
carbonation
is
broad
and
very
bubbly
lifts
things
off
the
tongue
almost
immediately
while
still
heavy
on
the
malts
with
chocolate
cocoa
coffee
accents
theres
more
grain
cereal
and
meadow
grass
elements
to
give
it
erectness
some
peat
moss
and
earth
too
the
additional
hoppiness
does
not
bring
bitterness
more
so
dryness
which
leads
into
a
crisp
precise
finish
makes
you
want
to
categorize
it
as
a
food
beer
after
enjoying
the
moa
original
lager
i
decided
to
pick
this
up
toaday
and
i
enjoyed
this
to
poured
more
of
a
russett
color
with
a
tight
one

that
settled
slowly
big

roast
and
a

wich
was
a
surprise
not
a
bad
one
just
a
surprise

the

i
have

finishes
tingly
clean
crisp
and
dry
tasty
and
drinkable
beer
happy
to
have
stumbled
upon
it
in
a
wine
bar
d
the
carbonation
on
these
beers
makes
them
awesomely
drinkable
d
wow
this
was
a
killer
beer
i
had
wanted
to
try
this
one
but
was
afraid
the
green
bottle
would
screw
up
the
flavor
no
worries
there
this
was
like
a
beautiful
combination
of
a
dunkel
and
a
porter
delicious
and
sessionable
drinkability
nope
see
taste
out
of
a
750ml
corked
and
caged
bottle
pours
a
cola
brown
color
with
a
khaki
colored
tight
head
that
dissipated
into
a
solid
cap
light
lager
aromas
a
bit
of
roasted
malt
wood
and
tin
bigger
roasted
character
in
the
taste
some
wood
andor
smoke
the
feel
is
thin
with
fizzy
carbonation
finishes
with
a
roasted
bitterness
an
easy
drinking
lager
with
a
light
feel
yet
some
nice
flavor
the
taste
is
rich
caramelised
fruit
burnt
buttery
caramel
bread
crust
toasty
whole
wheat
it
starts
sweet
and
develops
light
bitterness
and
a
light
yeastyfruity
sourness
and
its
zesty
and
a
little
spicey
its
very
tasty
complex
with
a
lot
of
flavour
and
character
a
lot
is
going
on
and
it
all
coordinates
very
nicely
its
highly
drinkable
good
stuff
d
stout
like
flavours
without
the
heaviness
i
dig
it
drinkability
overall
a
nice
schwartzbier
could
have
some
more
sweetness
to
be
considered
a
contender
though
raped
in
the
ass
from
the
7
bucks
my
wife
paid
for
it
maybe
worth
about
2
a
great
challenger
to
the
german
dunkels
not
bad
by
any
means
but
really
not
that
good
either
maybe
a
field
trip
to
czech
republic
is
in
order
to
try
it
closer
to
the
source
overall
just
an
ok
beer
nothing
special
poured
into
a
pint
glass
from
the
500
ml
bottle
bought
at
the
utah
liquor
store
in
sugar
house
drinkability
is
good
this
beer
surprised
me
i
wouldnt
call
it
a
black
lager
to
me
this
tastes
more
like
a
porter
or
stout
it
has
a
strong
malt
taste
to
it
and
very
good
going
down
i
was
surprised
at
how
much
i
liked
this
beer
but
i
would
have
it
again
if
it
was
available
o
worth
the
money
about
average
not
terrible
final
notes
its
an
ok
beer
not
something
i
would
buy
again
but
its
not
bad
would
probably
make
a
great
barbecue
or
tailgating
beer
i
would
have
given
it
a
3
5
on
taste
had
it
not
been
for
that
metallic
back
end
that
taste
is
crap
drinkability
this
is
a
nice
drinkable
dark
lager
abv
is
low
enough
to
be
a
really
good
session
beer
although
it
is
just
a
tad
sweet
to
drink
all
night
long
its
still
good
for
a
couple
of
pints
suprisingly
good
dark
lager
happily
this
bottle
tastes
quite
fresh
god
bless
my
local
bevmos
eastern
european
clientele
the
beer
is
about
the
color
of
medium
strength
coffee
the
head
is
big
and
rocky
lots
of
lacing
the
aroma
is
sweetly
malty
all
caramel
dough
and
lightly
toasted
pumpernickel
the
flavor
is
sweet
with
malt
sugars
just
barely
tamed
by
some
subtle
hops
this
beer
drinks
a
lot
bigger
than
its
abv
the
mouthfeel
is
creamy
and
pleasing
it
reminds
me
of
a
good
dark
mild
made
as
a
lager
good
stuff
d
this
beer
is
quite
drinkable
easy
to
swallow
easy
on
the
stomach
very
tasty
but
not
overtly
complex
would
probably
make
a
nice
dark
session
beer
though
it
is
equally
enjoyable
when
drank
slow
glad
i
took
a
chance
on
this
one
and
picked
it
up
the
aroma
is
very
sweet
with
cola
toasted
malt
coffee
chocolate
and
syrup
the
appearance
is
nice
with
a
large
foamy
head
and
a
red
brown
color
the
flavor
is
like
the
aroma
with
a
bit
of
fruitiness
the
palate
is
thin
overall
its
interesting
but
its
sweet
and
a
tad
bit
strange
pours
a
nice
black
color
nice
carbonation
nice
little
creamy
tan
head
with
some
sticky
lacing
to
follow
the
nose
is
malty
with
lots
of
caramel
the
taste
is
sweet
malty
with
some
caramel
medium
body
drinkable
better
than
i
expected
thanks
chuck
d
not
bad
at
all
pretty
simple
flavors
but
tasty
nonetheless
goes
down
easy
this
could
be
a
good
session
a
good
change
of
pace
for
the
brown
ale
drinker
the
taste
is
sweet
and
creamy
toasty
fruity
with
hints
of
chocolate
a
lot
of
sweetly
caramelized
prune
and
raisin
with
very
faint
bitterness
and
a
slightly
dryish
finish
toasty
with
a
hint
of
leaves
pours
out
a
dark
and
clear
amberbrown
color
with
a
thick
offwhite
head
the
aroma
is
full
of
toasted
malts
and
light
chocolates
a
strong
toasted
malt
flavor
with
a
very
sweet
aftertaste
some
nutty
and
light
fruit
a
soft

much
dr

makes
it
a
drink
you

with

of
dried

not
much

happening
dry
quick
finish
leaves
the
impression
of
wateryness
pretty
thin
on
the
palate
but
that
might
just
be
the
finish
a
drinkable
enough
beer
but
totally
unremarkable
the
bottle
is
past
the
date
stamped
on
it
by
about
2
months
pours
very
dark
with
a
pretty
good
head
that
is
maintained
as
a
thick
lacing
throughout
the
rest
of
the
glass
has
a
sweet
mild
aroma
to
it
and
also
has
a
very
sweet
flavor
its
almost
too
sweet
without
having
enough
other
elements
to
balance
it
or
give
it
the
stiffness
it
needs
it
almost
tastes
like
a
mix
between
a
belgian
dark
ale
and
a
regular
czech
pilsner
its
good
and
reminds
me
of
my
days
drinking
in
germany
but
not
a
real
stellar
performance
the
mouthfeel
is
pretty
fizzynothing
fabulous
here
maybe
i
was
tired
but
i
was
bored
before
i
got
to
the
end
of
the
bottle
very
easy
drinking
for
a
beer
this
dark
as
it
warms
a
bit
you
get
some
chocolate
after
notes
its
really
quite
a
pleasant
beer
much
to
my
suprise
its
not
great
but
is
is
good
cheers
this
beer
is
malty
sweet
with
limited
hops
it
definitely
isnt
overdone
cool
crisp
and
refreshing
easy
to
drink
but
not
overly
unique
a
good
czech
beer
not
a
bad
beer
for
sitting
around
enjoying
the
scenery
a
nice
surprise
what
is
most
surprising
is
the
other
ratings
makes
me
wonder
if
you
were
drinking
this
too
cold
this
brew
is
supposed
to
be
chillled
pour
it
at
45
degrees
not
35
a
bit
of
an
odd
taste
combination
but
not
bad
taste
is
ok
i
guess
i
dunno
this
isnt
real
exciting
im
kind
of
looking
forward
to
finishing
this
so
i
can
try
something
else
no
date
on
the
bottle
again
well
started
out
promising
deep
clear
burgundy
pour
with
nice
tan
head
and
lacey
nice
chocolaty
malt
aroma
taste

hmmm
earthy
hoppy
with
a
proper
hop
balance
but
crap
kinda
thin
and
watery
lite
on
the
carbonation
so
it
was
ok
and
drinkable
a
good
summer
session
brew
just
not
anything
special
burgundy
appearance
with
a
fizzy
light
tan
head
aroma
was
accented
towards
a
coffee
like
acidity
with
light
fruits
in
the
background
flavor
had
more
bready
notes
with
a
little
residual
sweetness
body
was
lighter
actually
medium
but
the
flavors
werent
enough
weak
finish
easy
to
drink
easy
to
enjoy
one
of
but
im
done
after
that
lowish
level
of
carbonation
is
nice
for
the
style
quite
drinkable
if
a
bit
unexciting
had
this
at
spencers
steak
house
in
salt
lake
city
maybe
it
tasted
better
than
it
should
of
since
i
had
spent
an
entire
day
manning
a
booth
at
a
convention
but
this
beer
really
satisfied
me
nothing
astounding
but
a
solid
tasty
black
lager
nice
malty
aroma
a
little
burnt
malt
or
bitter
chocolate
definitely
not
too
sweet
quite
crisp
dry
almost
a
metallic
dryness
but
not
necessarily
in
a
bad
way
for
0
25
more
than
a
miller
light
i
couldnt
go
wrong
drinkability

i
enjoyed
the
malt
aspect
of
this
lager
but
could
do
without
the
summer
fruit
character
notes
not
bad
at
all
quite
a
appetizing
dark
lager
that
i
would
go
back
for
time
and
time
again
made
for
a
great
lunchtime
brew
with
hot
pastrami
on
rye
pours
a
clear
black
with
a
creamy
light
brown
head
moderate
lacing
light
carbonation
has
a
sweet
malty
smell
with
hints
of
chocolate
when
you
first
taste
it
its
really
good
creamy
and
chocolately
a
touch
of
bitterness

finishes
extremely
thin
like
water

leaves
a
metallic
and
dry
aftertaste
tastes
great
at
first
but
finishes
pretty
awful
pours
a
nice
deep
crimson
color
looks
better
when
held
up
to
the
light
with
a
pretty
thin
headaromas
of
caramel
and
even
a
little
brown
sugar
with
a
light
burnt
hint
as
well
taste
has
a
bready
kinda
note
to
it
with
some
roasted
malt
with
a
big
czech
hop
note
in
the
finish
makes
the
beer
very
clean
and
dry
tasting
a
little
thin
in
the
body
but
a
pretty
solid
czech
lagera
nice
find
this
beer
looked
and
smelled
pretty
good
color
was
very
dark
brown
with
ruby
highlights
when
held
up
to
the
light
a
bubbly
tan
head
quickly
faded
to
a
thin
ring
leaving
a
trace
of
lace
the
smell
promised
big
roasted
malt
and
coffee
flavors
and
those
flavors
were
there
along
with
a
big
off
aftertaste
that
was
somewhere
between
plastic
and
metallic
letting
it
warm
a
little
helped
some
but
it
was
still
nearly
undrinkable
pours
a
deep
dark
mahogany
with
very
little
light
coming
through
the
glass
the
aroma
is
all
about
roasted
maltschocolate
the
taste
follows
suit
with
some
mellow
roasted
malts
the
mouthfeel
is
relatively
smooth
and
there
is
a
slight
bitternessdryness
hop
to
the
finish
this
mildly
crisp
end
to
each
sip
snaps
you
out
of
roasted
malt
mode
and
reminds
you
that
hey
im
a
lager
too
poured
black
with
a
thick
tan
head
smelled
of
roasted
malts
carmel
sweetness
and
some

the
taste
had
chocolate
and
coffee
notes
and
some
maltiness
to
it
as
well
the
aftertaste
finished
with
a
slight
bitterness
mouthfeel
was
very
smooth
overall
a
good
beer
dark

dark

aftertaste
is
malty
and
slightly
bitter
when
this
beer
was
poured
into
my
glass
this
beer
had
a
small
tan
head
with
fine
sized
bubbles
the
body
was
clear
with
a
brownreddish
hue
the
lacing
was
only
fair
on
the
sides
of
my
glass
with
this
beer
the
flavor
reminded
me
of
burnt
coffee
and
the
mouthfeel
was
smooth
as
it
spills
from
the
bottle
a
very
deep
blackberry
color
the
head
impressive
in
size
spumous
in
structure
light
beige
in
color
and
the
remining
lace
a
nice
coating
sheet
nose
is
caramel
sweet

laden
fresh
and
pleasant
to
the
senses
sweet
at
the
start
lots
of
malt
the
top
thin
and
a
bit
watery
finish
is
mildly
acidic
crisply
hopped
dry
but
the
thinwaisted
feeling
detracts
much
and
leaves
me
lacking
and
the
best
i
can
do
is
average
and
thats
stretching
it
a
bit
this
is
not
a
bad
beer
by
any
stretch
but
its
also
not
something
id
go
out
of
my
way
for
either
there
is
very
little
complexity
but
the
dark
malts
do
factor
into
the
flavor
but
weakly
this
struck
me
as
a
fairly
pilsnerlike
beer
despite
the
darkness
this
is
their
best
offering
hands
down
the
body
has
a
deep
dark
brown
color
with
orange
hue
head
pours
large
but
disapates
quickly
to
a
cloud
of
offwhite
that
floats
on
the
surface
not
a
fragerant
brew
but
on
a
strong
whif
appetizing
scents
of
sweet
malts
become
apparent
taste
is
unique
not
solely
bitter
or
very
sweet
for
that
matter
a
nice
mellow
blend
of
both
with
an
odd
metallic
aftertaste
body
is
slightly
chewy
and
carbonation
is
light
i
would
say
this
would
be
a
very
drinkable
brew
if
not
for
that
aftertaste
light
texture
smooth
mouthfeel
very
mellow

but
very
satisfying

creamy

delicious
i
like
it
i
like
it
a
really
nice
just
really
pleasant
beer
from
pretty

i
wish
this
style
got
more

from
breweries
its

beer
id

it

but

this
beer
is
more
than
the

parts
an
excellent
and
fully
enjoyable
brew
the
whole
way
through
overall
i
have
never
never
had
a
bad
beer
from
pretty
things
but
i
have
to
admit
i
came
to
this
bottle
with
low
expectations
but
this
beer
has
taught
me
a
lesson
not
to
judge
a
beer
by
its
ba
category
i
am
compelled
by
the
complexity
here
top
notch
o
a
very
nice
eurostyle
lager
with
lots
of
maltiness
and
yeast
character
to
go
along
with
it
great
to
sip
on
and
enjoy
as
it
opens
up
and
unfolds
nicely
as
it
warms
definitely
worth
trying
poured
into
a
flute
glass
pours
a
very
dark
mahogany
brown
with
a
thin
light
tan
head
that
dissipates
to
a
ring
around
the
glass
nice
aroma
of
toasted
malt
and
chocolate
flavor
is
toasted
malt
charred
coffee
and
chocolate
light
grassy
hops
medium
bodied
a
nice
ale
on
the
border
between
porter
and
brown
ale
but
with
more
char
and
chocolate
than
usually
encountered
in
those
two
styles
im
not
sure
that
euro
dark
lager
is
really
very
accurate
for
this
more
complex
dark
ale
m
substantial
thick
nourishing
the
beer
style
reminds
of
a
porter
with
its
chocolate
and
toffee
tastes
and
smells
overall
st
winny

an
okay
beer

ill
probably

for
a
22oz
bottle
from
julios
liquors
westborough
ma
o
surprisingly
good
brew
its
basically
an
english
brown
lager
toasted
malt
nuttiness
a
little
smoke
lagering
it
seems
to
have
made
it
super
smooth
though
thus
extremely
drinkable
great
variety
and
balance
of
flavors
i
enjoy
brown
ales
in
general
so
im
a
little
biased
another
nice
beer
from
pretty
things
the
beer
pours
a
dark
brown
and
sits
in
the
glass
as
almost
black
with
a
deep
maroon
tint
to
it
and
a
rocky
finger
width
sandy
head
made
of
medium
sized
bubbles
that
smooth
out
on
top
to
create
a
creamy
texture
the
body
is
lager
clean
and
full
of
racing
bubbles
that
refill
the
head
the
beers
lacing
is
dry
and
sticky
on
the
sides
of
the
glass
leaving
thick
sheet
on
the
glass
on
the
nose
the
beer
smells
warmly
roasty
with
hints
of
coffee
bakers
chocolate
and
nice
nutty
scents
theirs
a
slight
metallic
tinge
to
the
smell
presumably
coming
from
the
lager
yeast
it
is
a
pleasing
yet
clean
smell
on
the
tongue
the
beer
tastes
roasted
sweet
and
bitter
with
a
faint
hint
of
an
acidic
tingle
the
balance
between
hoppy
bitter
and
a
roasted
bitter
seems
to
be
well
played
out
in
this
beer
the
flavor
begins
with
roasted
nut
flavors
and
a
touch
of
char
the
finish
is
oddly
dampered
and
mellow
compared
to
the
rest
of
the
taste
bringing
light
sweet
bread
flavors
to
mind
with
a
hint
of
raisin
and
date
dark
fruit
flavors
the
aftertaste
returns
to
the
roast
of
the
malts
which
touch
slightly
charred
flavors
as
the
beer
warms
the
dark
fruit
flavors
rise
in
the
mouth
and
linger
in
the
aftertaste
on
the
mouth
the
beer
feels
clean
and
crisp
on
the
mouth
it
feels
on
the
high
end
of
light
in
body
and
leaves
the
mouth
with
a
nice
light
dry
roast
in
the
mouth
overall
this
is
a
lovely
dark
lager
with
some
really
nice
roasty
malt
qualities
i
think
its
timing
in
release
is
perfect
as
pretty
things
releases
it
just
as
winter
begins
to
loosen
its
grip
on
the
land
the
beer
is
light
and
drinkable
but
with
some
lovely
dark
beer
roast
flavors
and
nuances
the
touch
of
dark
fruit
on
the
finish
adds
a
lovely
layer
of
complexity
to
this
beer
and
reminds
me
slightly
of
triple
bag
by
long
trail
on
lighter
this
beer
is
delicious
and
quite
drinkable
try
it
dark
chestnut
with
a
1
dense
tanbeige
cap
that
produced
solid
sheets
of
very
sticky
lace
good
head
retention
too
enjoyable
aroma
with
a
rich
maltiness
dry
roast
and
floral
notes
a
bit
of
yeasty
sharpness
a
bit
nutty
with
a
hint
of
toffee
roasty
flavour
with
mediumlow
bitterness
light
floral
hoppiness
with
bread
and
malt
character
nicely
balanced
to
keep
it
from
being
overly
sweet
mild
toffee
and
cocoa
grassy
bitterness
in
the
finish
medium
to
full
body
with
creamy
carbonation
slight
astringency
nice
texture
overall
this
was
an
enjoyable
beer
and
i
would
purchase
it
again
the
only
thing
that
seemed
slightly
out
of
balance
was
the
pronounced
bitterness
in
the
finish
overall
an
example
of
the
kind
of
lagers
more
brewers
should
be
trying
to
create
big
powerful
and
packed
full
of
flavor
pretty
things
shows
that
these
often
overlooked
styles
can
deliver
when
done
right
o
this
is
a
very
nice
lager
that
i
recommend
to
everyone
it
says
its
brewed
to
mark
the
end
of
winter
but
this
would
be
just
as
nice
in
the
fall
around
a
fire
o
a
bigger
bocklike
beer
with
a
deep
and
complex
malt
character
owing
to
the
decoction
mashing
it
has
shades
of
a
big
english
brown
ale
to
it
as
well
though
it
is
very
clean
this
beer
begs
to
be
paired
with
a
game
stew
o
the
flavors
of
earthy
hopsparticularly
those
that
persist
through
the
finishdont
make
this
one
of
the
easiest
beers
to
drink
but
it
a
rather
interesting
beer
to
sip
o
overall
this
is
a
good
beer
but
not
my
favourite
from
pretty
things
all
up
really
lovely
stuff
in
no
way
comparable
to
the
generic
euro
darks
which
share
its
classification
in
fact
this
has
the
complexity
and
style
of
the
better
doppelbocks
if
perhaps
losing
something
of
the
booze
and
sweetness
dont
let
the
classification
put
you
off
this
is
very
good
indeed
o
beautifullycrafted
but
sweet
to
a
fault
lovely
saint
winefride
hits
an
interesting
high
in
the
dark
lager
style
i
wouldnt
buy
it
again
but
it
was
a
nice
drink
o
an
excellent
browndark
lager
i
am
a
fan
of
this
style
and
this
one
really
hits
the
mark
the
malty
sweetness
and
body
really
are
excellent
would
love
to
have
this
one
again
good
stuff
d
very
drinkable
really
nice
dark
lager
the
flavors
are
really
nicely
balanced
and
complex
i
like
the
bit
of
nuttiness
and
dark
fruit
d
this
was
surprisingly
enjoyable
i
had
low
expectations
but
this
was
a
very
nice
brown
lager
and
was
a
nice
palate
cleanser
among
the
sours
and
stouts
we
had
would
gladly
drink
this
again
o
pretty
good
a
lot
like
the
standard
brown
ale
but
with
a
lot
lighter
body
for
a
style
i
dont
drink
very
often
i
certainly
enjoyed
this
one
a
somewhat
transluscent
but
dark
brown
color
with
a
healthy
light
brown
head
and
very
decent
lacing
the
aroma
is
deep
near
charcoal
swampy
brown
bread
malt
a
nice
sour
mash
edge
nice
the
flavor
excites
with
unheard
of
earthy
molasses
brown
bread
and
bitter
charcoal
theres
a
nice
grassy
hop
here
that
finishes
a
bit
dry
like
a
nice
brown
ale
but
delivers
a
certain
bocklike
quality
and
it
is
very
drinkable
from
a
chilled
glass
tart
malty
mediumlight
bodied
with
a
dry
edge
and
modest
but
entirely
adequate
carbonation
a
great
lager
brew
unique
overall
this
is
quite
a
treat
best
dark
lager
ive
ever
had
o
interesting
too
roasty
for
my
liking
for
this
style
but
at
least
this
beer
was
different
and
unique
delicious
no
real
category
for
this
very
unique
22
oz
bottle
from
best
damn
in
san
diego
as
always
an
interesting
offering
from
pretty
things
other
than
the
husky
astringent
qualities
of
the
bitterness
i
quite
like
this
beer
i
think
it
is
going
to
be
a
seasonal
release
i
would
definitely
look
for
it
again
next
year
taste
starts
malty
with
a
burnt
chewy
texture
to
the
middle
and
closes
with
some
warmth
and
a
lasting
bitterness
mouthfeel
is
pretty
smooth
and
drinkability
is
good
as
well
nice
brew
overall
the
taste
of
this
is
not
like
most
lagers
more
bocklike
with
some
gentle
raisin
and
slight
toasted
malt
with
a
light
nutty
roasted
tinge
with
more
spice
as
it
goes
on
the
hops
have
a
very
herbal
quality
and
lasting
bite
as
they
increasingly
take
over
the
malt
from
midtaste
until
the
dry
finish
each
taste
starts
the
ride
over
again
with
the
malt
in
front
and
keeps
a
decent
amount
of
chewy
and
almost
biscuitlike
tastes
overall
i
enjoyed
this
for
what
it
is
a
unique
lager
with
higher
than
average
hop
presence
it
is
kind
of
like
a
brown
pilsner
or
hoppy
bock
depending
which
way
your
palate
favors
i
like
that
it
is
a
style
bender
this
is
pretty
good
a
nice
dark
lager
like
a
less
estery
brown
ale
the
body
is
a
bit
heavy
and
somewhat
chewy
soft
carbonation
overall
real
tasty
stuff
here
glad
to
try
it
and
would
grab
this
again
mouthfeel
is
decent
full
bodied
chewy
with
medium
light
carbonation
good
beer
wouldnt
get
it
again
if
im
looking
for
a
lager
but
maybe
if
im
looking
for
a
good
dark
brew
overall
a
cross
between
saint
botolphs
and
and
english
brown
not
a
bad
beer
as
it
has
moments
of
real
depth
and
complexity
i
have
been
blown
away
by
several
pretty
things
brews
however
this
one
just
struck
me
as
just
above
average
not
likely
to
get
this
one
again
22oz
bottle
served
in
a
pilsener
glass
at
53
degrees
pours
a
semihazy
brown
with
red
highlights
when
backlit
head
is
one
inch
dense
and
creamcolored
and
eventually
settles
into
a
creamy
broken
slick
thick
textured
rings
of
lacing
coat
the
sides
of
the
glass
during
the
tasting
nose
expresses
toasted
malts
a
nutty
character
and
a
trace
of
wet
cardboard
reminds
me
of
a
nut
brown
ale
taste
consistent
with
nose
although
thankfully
no
wet
cardboard
i
have
to
say
that
the
flavor
profile
is
very
wellrounded
theres
is
almost
a
nutty
sweetness
but
a
pleasant
lightearthy
hops
bittering
peaks
out
and
cuts
it
to
keep
it
from
being
cloying
theres
also
a
slight
ashiness
or
char
towards
the
back
mouthfeel
is
lightmedium
in
body
with
a
consistent
carbonation
level
that
falls
just
short
of
lively
theres
also
a
slight
acidity
present
overall
i
cant
say
that
i
am
rating
this
to
style
however
i
did
quite
enjoy
this
beer
as
previously
stated
this
beer
had
a
lot
of
qualities
reminiscent
of
a
nut
brown
ale
in
my
opinion
that
said
i
found
it
really
wellbalanced
and
quite
drinkable
the
7
99
pricetag
would
probably
keep
me
from
buying
this
beer
on
a
regular
basis
but
it
has
definitely
piqued
my
interest
in
exploring
this
style
further
tastey
beer
with
character
and
punch
but
a
bit
outside
of
what
might
be
expected
for
this
style
feel
is
at
a
pretty
much
medium
there
is
some
life
in
the
carb
and
the
aftertaste
is
lingering
i
have
never
had
an
off
bottle
of
pretty
things
they
know
how
to
tweak
the
carb
per
style
which
is
english
dominated
from
what
ive
seen
i
love
these
guys
another
quality
offering
from
pretty
things
nothing
quite
falls
into
traditional
style
guidelines
but
nothing
is
too
extreme
as
to
be
hard
to
drink
a
bit
pricey
but
thats
nitpicking
the
flavor
is
an
improvement
darker
malts
predominate
the
smell
theres
a
good
hop
counterpoint
the
unpleasant
smell
comes
back
in
the
swallow
but
the
aftertaste
has
an
enjoyable
bitterness
the
body
is
as
would
be
expected
the
carbonation
is
similarly
neutral
im
looking
forward
to
the
day
im
a
crazy
old
man
who
sits
on
the
porch
and
yells
at
the
world
passing
by
i
could
do
it
with
this
beer
in
hand
the
alcohol
was
right
on
target
as
i
couldnt
taste
it
but
certainly
felt
it
once
i
worked
my
way
through
the
bomber
there
isnt
a
description
for
this
category
of
beer
on
here
and
i
had
yet
to
try
one
from
this
style
before
tonight
with
that
being
said
this
was
wonderful
to
try
and
had
made
me
wonder
why
more
beers
like
this
arent
on
the
shelf
this
taste
probably
leans
too
much
toward
the
earthy
aspect
of
bitterness
for
some
drinkers
but
those
who
seek
this
out
looking
for
deviance
from
the
norm
will
not
be
disappointed
it
may
look
like
cola
and
have
the
initial
taste
of
sasparilla
but
theres
no
doubt
that
this
is
a
pretty
thing
unto
itself
a
perfect
beer
for
this
time
of
year
overall
its
enjoyable
but
i
was
hoping
for
a
little
more
too
similar
in
experience
to
st
botolphs
and
not
quite
as
good
for
me
to
ever
choose
this
over
botolphs
overall
a
pretty
nice
beer
nice
lager
flavors
and
crispness
with
nice
brown
toasty
malts
nice
hop
kick
fairly
bitter
and
tasty
but
a
decent
hop
profile
although
maybe
slightly
too
bitter
and
earthy
but
otherwise
pretty
nice
pint
glass
pours
a
deep
brown
with
a
big
tan
head
not
much
lacing
smell
is
grain
and
herbs
some
woody
notes
taste
starts
off
with
rich
grainy
notes
then
some
burnt
toffee
then
lots
of
charred
bitterness
the
burnt
quality
takes
over
as
it
warms
its
medium
in
body
moderately
carbonated
a
decent
beer
but
a
little
too
strong
and
a
little
too
burnt
o
a
great
and
unique
brew
i
really
enjoyed
this
one
nice
and
roasty
toasty
great
for
the
end
of
winter
as
is
intended
nice
but
not
overwheliming
complexity
and
a
very
nice
drink
ability
i
would
deffinatley
recommend
this
one
extremely
dark
mahogany
from
a
distance
it
looks
black
a
small
amount
of
foam
is
is
left
around
the
rim
rich
chocolate
and
coffee
aroma
slightly
smokey
flavor
is
heavy
on
roasted
malts
chocolate
and
coffee
just
like
the
aroma
faint
amounts
of
an
earthy
hop
character
but
it
is
covered
by
the
large
amount
of
malts
thin
body
and
a
big
carbonation
tingle
but
it
has
a
subtle
creamy
mouthfeel
soon
after
the
big
malt
flavor
a
overwhelming
bitterness
sets
in
extremely
earthy
and
dry
a
bitterness
that
will
not
leave
the
back
of
my
palate
a
true
winter
brew
lean
on
sweetness
big
on
bitter
i
like
this
odexceeded
my
expectations
after
i
head
this
beers
description
but
then
i
remembered
that
this
was
a
pretty
things
brew
and
i
remembered
that
they
can
do
no
wrong
another
bottle
of
liquid
gold
from
pt
this
is
a
mighty
fine
dark
lager
exactly
the
hearty
smooth
deliciousness
other
examples
from
the
style
seem
to
lack
i
have
to
try
it
on
draft
because
this
bottle
was
quick
finished
overall
i
am
a
big
fan
of
pretty
things
and
this
is
another
great
beer
to
add
to
their
lineup
i
highly
recommend
trying
it
if
you
find
it
this
saint
even
as
a
solid
lager
at
7
could
make
you
drink
a
few
perhaps
causing
you
to
do
something
stupid
or
dare
i
say
lose
your
head
dark
chocolately
but
surprisingly
light
to
medium
bodied
easy
drinking
and
smoothfinishing
this
is
not
bad
at
all
this
is
a
very
good
black
lager
that
i
try
to
keep
in
my
fridge
dark
roasty
coffee
chocolate
crisp
and
fin
delicious
this
beer
should
always
be
in
my
fridge
and
i
cant
believe
it
doesnt
get
more
love

a

was
pretty
light
for
a

didnt

relax
and
enjoy
a
few
on
a
cold
day
with
a
close
friend
ive
had
a
strong
craving
for
dark
lagers
after
returning
from
the
czech
republic
so
i
was
happy
to
see
this
on
the
shelves
of
my
local
whole
foods
its
a
lightbody
beer
with
notes
of
toffee
caramel
and
roasted
coffee
perhaps
sweeter
than
im
familiar
with
but
very
pleasant
for
stoutlovers
stuck
in
summer
weather
one
of
the
best
dark
lagers
i
have
had
that
is
for
a
good
price
overall
ill
give
1554
black
lager
new
belgium
brewing
a
4
25
if
it
were
just
a
hair
more
savory
i
would
have
rated
this
higher
it
could
certainly
have
a
little
more
to
it
then
this
would
be
phenomenal
i
may
or
may
not
pick
this
brew
up
again
it
was
part
of
the
folly
variety
pack
recently
released
around
here
stark
county
oh
so
i
honestly
dont
know
if
its
available
for
individual
sale
very
nice
i
like
how
much
not
a
bad
beer
kinda
watered
down
with
a
little
carbonation
and
some
chocolate
undertones
overall
a
very
nice
black
lager
the
roast
is
pleasing
and
balances
well
with
the
other
malts
would
recommend
trying
if
your
looking
for
a
fresh
schwarzbier
in
the
us
and
you
can
get
it
just
about
anywhere
black
lagers
are
hard
to
come
by
and
new
belgium
does
a
great
job
on
this
one
dark
in
color
but
the
mouth
feel
is
super
light
decent
black
lager
drinkable
worth
a
try
now
1554
seems
like
nothing
special
its
certainly
ok
and
im
drinking
all
of
the
6
pack
i
bought
but
its
not
as
tasty
as
a
really
good
lager
and
not
as
interesting
as
a
dark
beer
as
any
of
the
porters
i
can
think
of
neither
fish
nor
fowl
just
kind
of
bleh
love
me
some
new
belgium
i
stick
to
my
roots
perfect
mix
of
malt
and
freshness
the
same
as
the
enlightened
black
aleand
thus
underrated
i
was
pleasantly
surprised
with
this
beer
pours
thick
and
dark
brown
with
minimal
tan
head
not
strong
on
the
nose
but
there
is
a
slight
dark
malt
scent
medium
to
heavy
body
very
light
on
the
lager
taste
comes
off
like
a
light
porter
very
drinkable
and
i
could
see
drinking
plenty
by
a
campfire
a
nice
smooth
finish
and
soft
dark
taste
completely
agree
with
arch578s
review
a
few
reviews
below
this
one
overall
very
nice
id
say
quite
comparable
to
guinness
with
a
different
taste
1554
contains
much
more
toasty
flavor
12
oz
bottle
poured
into
an
undersized
hotel
glass
on
a
montana
ski
trip
i
love
black
lagers
so
was
excited
to
find
this
nb
take
on
the
style
it
is
sweeter
than
i
usually
prefer
with
plenty
of
chocolate
a
hint
of
coffee
and
a
very
dry
finish
in
some
ways
this
seems
like
a
beer
that
forgets
to
be
a
beer
if
that
makes
sense
really
not
impressed
with
this
beer
nothing
special
about
its
appearance
or
aroma
and
the
taste
just
reminded
me
of
a
cheap
porter
i
understand
that
lagers
are
usually
meant
to
be
more
drinkable
but
i
feel
this
one
went
beyond
drinkability
to
the
point
of
lacking
body
and
depth
im
not
particularly
fond
of
the
style
to
begin
with
but
i
dont
think
this
beer
lived
up
to
what
a
schwarzbier
can
and
should
be
o
but
for
the
nose
this
would
be
jumping
into
my
main
beer
rotation
the
taste
and
drinkability
are
a
great
combination
and
the
flavors
offer
sufficient
variety
and
depth
to
offer
different
aspects
to
focus
upon
with
each
drink
so
it
will
be
something
ill
grab
occasionally
instead
fat
tire
was
my
favorite
until
i
tried
this
beer
perfect
blend
of
spices
not
too
heavy
and
surprisingly
refreshing
a
decent
beer
overall
but
disappointing
this
is
by
far
the
best
offering
from
new
belgium
i
have
had
and
without
a
doubt
the
best
black
lager
ive
ever
had
as
well
the
dang
thing
didnt
look
like
a
lager
it
looked
like
a
guinness
it
didnt
taste
like
a
lager
way
much
richer
and
full
bodied
and
it
sure
didnt
feel
like
one
not
so
carbonated
to
take
away
from
the
tasting
experience
i
dont
know
if
this
is
a
sessionable
beer
but
for
me
it
certainly
will
be
in
the
future
poured
from
a
brown
12
oz
bottle
has
a
black
color
with
a
12
inch
head
smell
is
sweet
and
malty
taste
is
roasted
malts
chocolate
sweet
very
easy
drinking
feels
light
in
the
mouth
and
overall
is
an
enjoyable
beer
fantastic
beer
the
chocolate
flavor
lingers
on
my
tongue
and
the
coloring
is
just
gorgeous
one
of
my
favorites
to
have
with
breakfast
after
a
night
at
work
in
fact
it
has
dethroned
a
few
others
now
it
is
delicious
dark
dry
chocolate
notes
and
character
around
a
toasty
biscuit
malt
lager
highly
drinkable
and
a
crisp
finish
poured
into
a
frozen
thick
glass
24
oz
mug
thick
persistent
amber
head
fruity
on
the
nose
crisp
front
palate
followed
by
a
smoooooooth
finish
carrying
a
moderate
hint
of
malted
dark
chocolate
im
not
a
fan
of
chocolate
tasting
beers
but
this
is
different
i
may
be
giving
this
a
higher
score
than
most
as
the
beer
is
clearly
not
complicated
yet
i
would
argue
that
our
early
brew
masters
never
intended
for
beer
to
be
complicated
yet
im
sure
that
in
1554
this
beer
was
considered
by
most
a
quite
complicated
i
know
were
also
not
meant
to
allow
our
emotions
to
come
into
the
analysis
but
i
love
this
beer
overall
this
is
a
decent
dark
lager
thats
sweeter
than
it
is
roasty
nothing
to
write
home
about
but
not
bad
either

a

well
done
i
love
this
stuff
the
dark
roast
of
the
malt
makes
me
imagine
of
a
kind
of
protoschwarzbier
that
according
to
new
belguim
was
being
brewed
in
1554
enjoyed
a
six
of
this
at
the
quality
inn
in
valdosta
on
the
way
to
the
barber
vintage
moto
fest
an
okay
version
of
a
black
lager
not
their
best
very
descent
schwarzbier
with
not
to
lose
to
the
euro
counterparties
this
is
a
lager
packed
with
dark
chocolate
flavors
not
overly
sweet
and
with
huge
drinkability
onot
what
i
typically
drink
but
it
works
better
than
anticipated
a
solid
beer
for
those
that
like
dark
beers
but
shy
away
from
bone
dry
thin
stouts
and
huge
high
alcohol
imperials
impressed
although
i
think
unitas
black
lager
is
a
step
better
this
is
a
damn
good
beer
excellent
addition
to
their
current
selection
bought
an
entire
6
pack
the
only
other
black
lager
that
i
ever
had
was
by
guinness
and
i
found
it
somewhat
boring
this
ones
a
different
story
very
good
taste
and
a
chocolaty
edge
give
it
a
shot
ohaving
had
the
new
belgium
black
ale
numerous
times
i
didnt
even
notice
this
was
the
lager
when
i
bought
it
anyway
there
are
similarities
between
to
the
two
in
their
flavor
profiles
which
are
both
decent
enough
maltforward
drinkable
dark
beers
nothing
spectacular
here
but
definitely
worth
a
try
when
you
want
to
break
your
routine
of
iipas
and
riss
and
the
like
poured
from
a
bottle
into
a
shaker
pint
the
beer
is
a
dark
brown
color
crystal
clear
with
a
chestnut
hue
around
the
edges
and
a
filmy
clingy
dense
cream
colored
head
aromas
of
toasted
nut
sweetness
subtle
cream
highlights
hints
of
grain
subtle
coffee
bitterness
and
some
light
cocoa
highlights
the
flavors
are
roasted
and
richly
sweet
forward
again
heavy
on
the
nutty
characteristics
with
a
tangy
cream
tone
this
time
the
roasting
coincides
with
a
subtle
coffee
highlight
to
provide
enough
bitterness
to
balance
throughout
the
body
is
light
and
smooth
with
a
tangy
sweet
nutty
lingering
aftertaste
the
finish
is
smooth
and
lingering
as
well
easy
drinker
and
very
flavorful
overall
a
drinkable
beer
that
is
not
remarkable
but
is
flavorful
without
complexity
overall
its
a
damn
smooth
black
lager
with
lacing
smell
and
not
too
intense
flavors
very
good
beer
for
a
not
so
handcrafted
beer
this
is
a
wonderful
example
of
a
beer
thats
just
enjoyable
along
with
moving
average
uneducated
american
beer
drinkers
into
something
thats
not
piss
yellow
made
from
nothing
nbb
is
a
go
to
beer
for
just
about
anyone
as
an
aside
im
curious
why
sam
adams
black
lager
counts
as
a
schwarzbier
but
new
belgium
1554
black
lager
gets
stuck
in
the
euro
dark
lager
category
that
same
sweetness
keeps
this
beer
from
getting
too
sweet
too
soon
easing
into
the
dryness
the
same
way
the
flavor
does
the
somewhat
ashy
nature
applies
to
the
texture
as
well
and
again
it
works
here
the
crispness
is
light
but
firm
and
the
light
body
isnt
watery
or
shallow
a
creamy
smoothness
starts
right
off
with
the
crispness
on
the
tip
of
the
tongue
and
carries
through
into
the
woody
finish
the
mouthfeel
is
medium
bodied
with
good
amounts
of
carbonation
and
a
little
bit
of
a
sticky
finish
overall
this
is
a
good
dark
lager
with
nice
flavors
good
balance
a
clean
finish
and
it
looks
great
not
my
favorite
style
ever
but
an
enjoyable
beer
this
is
one
to
leave
out
the
fridge
for
1520
min
much
better
nice
lacing
on
the
mug
overall
nice
brew
black
in
colorbut
it
does
allow
some
light
through
when
held
up
to
the
light
i
see
a
half
inch
head
of
khaki
colored
foam
brussels
lacing
i
get
caramel
and
chocolate
notes
in
the
aroma
the
body
is
smooth
and
creamy
i
get
dark
malt
and
a
light
bitterness
on
the
front
of
the
palate
the
finish
brings
out
the
sweet
chocolate
notes
the
flavor
seems
a
bit
muted
the
nb
1554
black
lager
is
a
decent
offering
the
beer
poured
a
nearly
opaque
dark
with
creamy
slightly
offwhite
head
that
is
leaving
a
lace
the
scent
carries
slight
roast
corn
flare
the
taste
starts
with
a
roast
grain
then
turns
slightly
bitter
and
finally
finishes
a
little
sweet
the
mouthfeel
is
medium
in
body
with
good
carbonation
overall
this
is
a
decent
sessionable
beer
o
easy
to
drink
and
somewhat
refreshing
though
not
overly
interesting
i
would
perhaps
order
it
again
but
i
would
not
seek
it
out
alcohol
is
well
hidden
it
really
is
ok
to
to
drink
but
very
easy

overall
a
refreshing
and
drinkable
beer
its
crisp
and
clean
but
all
in
all
does
not
do
much
to
stand
out
from
the
pack
overall
its
a
great
beer
new
belgium
gets
a
lot
of
flack
because
they
are
growing
into
such
a
huge
industry
but
that
should
every
businesses
goal
to
grow
good
beer
is
good
beer
no
matter
how
big
the
brewery
is
new
belgium
keeps
growing
without
sacrificing
quality
and
i
keep
buying
overall
it
is
pretty
decent
beer
easy
to
drink
a
few
of
them
overall
decent
but
nothing
to
special
kind
of
like
a
hybrid
porterlager
its
a
bit
weak
in
the
flavor
though
but
in
all
very
smooth
and
easy
to
drink
but
at
the
same
time
very
easy
to
forget
the
taste
rocks
like
its
1599
a
nice
balanced
beer
and
very
mild
for
the
style
but
very
drinkable
it
is
missing
the
overly
roast
flavor
most
black
lagers
have
and
thats
a
good
thing

sessionable

smooth
overall
im
into
this
beer
and
i
cant
wait
to
try
more
from
new
belgium
o
ive
had
this
beer
before
and
i
like
it
a
little
robust
for
a
black
lager
but
i
aint
complaining
i
would
definitely
drink
this
again
another
new
belgium
brew
that
has
high
marks
this
beer
was
not
bad
it
pours
a
clear
deep
mahogany
brown
body
beneath
creamy
head
of
light
tan
that
holds
well
and
leaves
some
very
nice
lacing
the
nose
it
gently
caramelish
mainly
dark
caramel
nutty
and
lightly
toasty
the
flavor
adds
some
more
golden
caramel
to
it
a
hint
of
light
fruitiness
and
a
touch
of
dusty
chocolate
as
well
backed
by
some
leafy
and
herbal
hops
its
got
a
very
firm
bitterness
to
it
and
it
finishes
dry
with
a
bit
of
crushed
granite
some
bakers
chocolate
and
more
leafy
hops
eric
taste
is
a
roasted
sweetness
balanced
by
a
decent
hop
finish
not
overly
crisp
and
clean
but
pretty
tasty
solid
overall
dark
lager
which
is
a
style
uncommon
to
expect
from
an
american
craft
brewer
o
this
is
a
very
drinkable
beer
with
a
couple
slight
rough
edges
but
nothing
that
would
prevent
me
from
drinking
many
more
quite
enjoyable
corn
sweetness
and
bitterness
level
makes
this
very
enjoyable
a
decent
enough
dark
lager
with
more
than
a
few
munich
dunkel
notes
to
recommend
it
by
perhaps
a
tad
plain
but
thats
a
positive
aspect
in
this
realm
where
offflavours
and
unwelcome
phenols
tend
to
lurk
worthy
of
a
round
or
two
over
dark
wooden
tables
a
well
done
dark
lager
easy
drinking
but
still
quite
flavorful
not
too
bad
but
nothing
extraordinary
about
this
one
a
strong
roast
bitterness
but
not
necessarily
a
deep
roast
malt
feel
with
a
light
yeast
character
just
doesnt
blend
together
all
that
well
for
me
with
the
flavor
switching
from
yeast
to
roast
to
a
metallic
off
flavor
very
small
but
comes
out
nonetheless
overall
i
was
expecting
more
from
a
stellar
brewery
this
beer
is
certainly
drinkable
sessionable
but
lacking
a
real
knockout
punch
of
flavor
a
big
thanks
to
the
legendary
woodychandler
for
this
beer
poured
from
a
16
oz
can
has
a
cola
color
with
a
1
inch
head
smell
is
very
mild
some
light
roasted
malts
are
detected
taste
is
also
kind
of
light
some
roasted
malts
a
touch
of
smoke
really
not
a
whole
lot
going
on
feels
mediumfull
in
the
mouth
and
overall
is
pretty
much
a
mediocre
beer
o
this
is
a
nice
dark
lager
its
a
bit
surprising
to
see
this
coming
from
california
but
anderson
valley
did
a
good
job
of
capturing
a
wellrounded
drinkable
version
of
a
somewhat
unpopular
style
overall
meh
not
the
best
schwarzbier
lager
seemed
a
little
too
warm
some
metallic
notes
decent
dark
malts
overall
just
not
the
best
put
together
beer
o
ive
probably
had
about
50
of
these
im
writing
this
review
as
i
drink
my
last
one
this
is
a
great
beer
i
could
see
myself
returning
to
this
over
and
over
again
its
perfectly
balanced
and
makes
for
an
awesome
everyday
beer
i
really
cant
recommend
this
enough
overall
an
enjoyable
beer
with
some
great
flavor
o
again
not
exactly
what
i
was
hoping
for
an
interesting
head
scratcher
beer
especially
from
avbc
good
perhaps
better
as
dark
summer
beer
but
definitely
not
great
what
can
you
do
when
a
beer
foams
through
the
opening
right
after
the
crack
not
an
inverted
glug
i
assure
you
i
allowed
things
to
settle
in
until
two
fingers
of
dense
deeptan
head
had
formed
evincing
good
retention
i
had
poured
it
into
my
anderson
valley
can
glass
which
is
pretty
darn
cool
color
was
a
deep
dark
brown
srm
34
44
with
nequality
clarity
and
ruby
highlights
nose
had
notes
of
milk
chocolate
and
a
light
smokiness
mouthfeel
was
medium
and
the
the
taste
was
very
chocolaty
more
sweet
than
i
might
have
preferred
but
not
bad
beautiful
lacing
began
to
appear
as
i
drank
from
the
glass
finish
was
silky
smooth
and
i
was
halfway
through
it
before
it
even
registered
how
quickly
that
i
was
drinking
good
stuff
and
worth
a
shot
if
this
is
your
style
of
beer
for
me
im
going
back
to
an
ipa
light
body
but
full
feeling
in
the
mouth
prickly
and
brisk
carbonation
but
the
beer
holds
up
to
it
typical
of
something
akin
to
a
negro
modelo
but
definitely
more
roast
character
a
bit
more
complexity
and
body
lightly
roasted
malt
up
front
dry
grains
along
the
mid
palate
and
balancing
faint
hop
bitterness
roast
character
lingers
subtle
notes
of
coffee
and
toffee
pairing
oddly
really
well
with
garlic
pesto
right
now
brings
out
the
more
sublte
flavors
pretty
good
overall
a
good
beer
not
something
i
will
likely
buy
again
though
the
beer
just
doesnt
wow
me
o
not
amazing
but
easy
to
drink
and
pairs
very
well
with
some
lamb
sausages
off
the
grill
there
is
a
little
more
subtly
to
the
flavor
and
aroma
of
this
beer
but
i
can
appreciate
it
16oz
can
deep
clear
amber
with
a
rocky
offwhite
head
this
retains
with
a
smooth
froth
that
rings
the
sides
of
the
glass
with
sticky
lace
the
aroma
is
a
nice
mix
of
sweet
and
roasty
maybe
even
smoky
with
a
tinge
of
green
citrus
and
floral
accents
on
the
edges
the
taste
has
a
crisp
green
hop
bite
surrounded
by
a
combination
of
malt
sweetness
and
lingering
roast
the
mouthfeel
is
medium
bodied
with
a
tight
creaminess
to
the
carbonation
yet
this
remains
very
smooth
this
was
decent
it
could
have
used
a
bit
more
of
a
push
from
the
malts
but
its
still
pretty
drinkable
16oz
can
poured
into
chilled
glass
the
color
is
a
medium
brown
with
a
foamy
beige
head
the
aroma
has
a
nice
malt
smell
to
it
the
texture
is
ok
with
a
heavy
malt
taste
i
didnt
know
what
to
expect
from
this
beer
but
the
taste
was
pretty
unique
not
really
a
fan
of
the
overall
flavor
but
im
sure
others
would
like
it
not
a
bad
brew
from
a
brewery
im
not
very
fond
of
if
only
there
were
some
actual
mexican
beers
as
drinkable
as
this
from
the
16
oz
can
purchased
at
bine
vine
in
san
diego
many
craft
beer
folk
will
not
appreciate
this
beer
since
its
flavor
is
so
subdued
subtle
and
simplevery
unlike
most
american
style
hoppy
ales
still
this
is
a
classic
spartan
super
high
quality
beerto
be
appreciated
by
those
with
cultivated
tastes
opretty
drinkable
and
fairly
flavorful
no
where
near
as
good
as
death
and
taxes
but
its
tough
to
beat
moonlight
cheers
el
steinber
for
what
its
worth
is
a
spoton
american
craft
version
of
a
euro
dark
lager
thats
not
in
a
green
bottle
it
nails
the
taste
of
the
euro
imports
ive
had
from
the
nice
maltiness
right
down
to
a
slight
metallic
aftertaste
itd
be
better
if
they
lost
that
characteristic
aftertaste
but
its
still
a
good
beer
thats
highly
drinkable
the
body
was
smooth
and
easy
as
is
typical
for
the
style
drinkability
was
good
16oz
can
was
gone
quickly
and
i
see
myself
grabbing
more
in
the
future
overall
a
pretty
good
beer
not
quite
up
with
the
best
examples
of
the
style
but
certainly
worth
a
shot
if
you
see
it
pours
a
really
nice
clear
brown
with
a
deep
redness
thick
head
with
a
good
bit
of
nice
lacing
smell
has
a
slight
caramel
to
it
with
a
little
maltiness
taste
is
all
malt
with
a
little
hoppiness
comes
across
pretty
light
for
such
a
dark
brew
over
all
this
is
a
pretty
solid
beer
i
definitely
wouldnt
be
opposed
to
trying
more
beers
from
anderson
valley
overall
this
beers
got
some
nice
things
going
for
it
in
fact
it
might
be
the
best
euro
dark
lager
style
beer
ive
come
across
this
is
a
beer
in
can
form
id
bring
with
me
to
the
river
that
said
its
not
a
style
that
really
grabs
me
id
rather
go
with
a
nice
esb
even
without
that
crisp
lager
edge
o
considering
that
the
euro
dark
lager
isnt
exactly
the
greatest
or
most
complex
style
el
steinber
is
a
pretty
good
version
of
it
oddly
drinkable
overall
this
is
quite
a
fail
on
anderson
valley
i
expected
a
dark
lager
with
chocolate
tones
and
sweet
malts
and
got
a
dry
bitter
lager
skip
it
if
you
can
pours
a
clear
dark
copper
with
a
foamy
dark
khaki
head
that
settles
to
a
partial
film
on
top
of
the
beer
small
dots
of
lace
form
around
the
glass
on
the
drink
down
smell
is
of
toasted
malt
char
and
slight
nutty
aromas
taste
is
much
the
same
with
toast
and
slight
metallic
flavors
on
the
finish
there
is
a
mild
amount
of
roasty
bitterness
on
the
palate
with
each
sip
this
beer
has
a
lower
level
of
carbonation
with
a
slightly
crisp
mouthfeel
overall
this
is
a
pretty
poor
beer
with
a
metallic
flavor
that
lingers
in
the
mouth
and
is
quite
unpleasant
overall
this
beer
really
doesnt
grab
me
the
lingering
aftertaste
and
the
relatively
strong
corn
aroma
are
not
pluses
in
my
book
however
there
is
some
pleasure
to
be
had
drinking
this
beer
it
could
just
be
cleaner
overall
i
thought
this
was
a
nice
beer
and
a
good
example
of
the
style
it
had
some
nice
roasty
flavors
with
some
crisp
and
clean
lager
flavors
it
fulfilled
my
craving
for
this
style
this
beer
had
pretty
good
drinkability
it
was
pretty
smooth
crisp
clean
and
the
flavors
did
a
nice
job
at
holding
my
attention
i
could
drink
a
few
of
these
on
a
cool
summer
night
i
think
its
fairly
sessionable
what
i
liked
the
most
about
this
beer
was
the
appearance
and
the
mouthfeel
they
were
pretty
good
and
the
taste
was
pretty
nice
also
its
pretty
much
what
i
want
from
the
style
what
i
liked
the
least
about
this
beer
was
the
aroma
it
was
pretty
bland
and
it
didnt
get
me
too
excited
to
drink
this
beer
i
think
the
aroma
could
use
a
little
work
i
would
buy
this
beer
again
when
in
the
mood
for
a
black
lager
its
got
just
about
everything
that
i
look
for
in
the
style
and
i
would
recommend
it
to
anyone
who
likes
the
style
and
it
might
make
a
for
good
introduction
to
dark
beers
all
in
all
i
was
pretty
happy
with
this
beer
it
really
hit
the
spot
on
this
warm
spring
night
and
i
know
i
will
be
drinking
a
few
more
of
these
this
summer
good
job
guys
this
is
one
solid
beer
interesting
overall
beer
definitely
sessionable
in
fact
if
i
could
find
a
sixer
of
this
i
would
take
it
to
the
next
poker
night
or
nhl
playoff
watch
party
as
a
standalone
not
going
to
blow
you
away
an
interesting
choice
for
anderson
valley
but
at
the
same
time
you
can
see
why
they
did
it
high

overall
works
fairly
well
as
a
easygoing
easydrinking
dark
lager
this
beer
left
a
ridiculous
amount
of
lacing
on
the
glass
it
was
like
a
sheet
unfortunately
the
taste
didnt
stack
up
to
the
apparent
thickness
of
the
beer
i
realize
that
adjuncts
were
used
in
it
to
make
it
a
bit
lighter
but
i
dont
think
that
did
the
beer
any
real
favors
it
was
easy
to
drink
no
doubt
but
it
wasnt
particularly
enjoyable
in
some
regards
it
tasted
like
an
improved
formula
for
dos
equis
i
dont
regret
trying
it
but
av
is
way
better
than
this
medium
body
and
mostly
firm
feel
though
a
bit
thinner
than
the
best
lagers
the
beer
has
a
nice
clean
toffeelike
malty
flavor
up
front
and
a
slight
spicy
note
at
midpalate
that
carries
through
to
the
finish
unfortunately
the
beer
lacks
the
malty
chewiness
one
finds
in
the
best
examples
still
a
nice
easydrinking
sessionable
lager
in
the
european
tradition
that
accompanies
just
about
any
meal
o
the
thin
and
watery
nature
of
this
beer
makes
it
taste
somewhat
like
a
mexican
munich
dunkel
lager
o
overall
a
pretty
average
beer
not
much
going
on
except
some
roasted
malts
probably
wouldnt
seek
it
out
again
overall
not
bad
got
it
for
a
buck
in
a
closeout
section
of
the
local
beer
shop
i
wouldnt
hunt
for
this
again
this
is
some
rough
stuff
i
hope
that
it
toughens
up
their
army
troops
drinkability
i
got
a
single
bottle
of
this
for
the
name
and
the
country
and
hopefully
for
something
different
and
though
im
glad
i
tried
it
i
wouldnt
try
it
again
if
i
had
a
choice
a
pretty
below
average
brew
all
around
and
nothing
more
d
tasty
and
it
seemed
to
get
better
as
i
drank
it
goes
down
easily
not
too
filling
mild
kick
in
a
style
that
usually
doesnt
do
too
much
to
impress
a
beerdrinker
this
beer
isnt
that
bad
i
could
drink
a
few
but
wouldnt
pick
it
if
i
had
a
decent
group
to
choose
from
pours
a
brown
with
an
orange
tint
when
light
is
held
to
it
nose
is
like
dirty
water
slight
sugary
sweet
tone
to
it
flavor
is
a
little
bit
better
than
i
was
expecting
but
still
pretty
lackluster
metallic
aftertaste
is
preceded
by
a
slight
sweet
touch
and
a
deeper
typical
lager
feel
is
standard
on
the
carbonation
drinkable
sure
if
this
were
cheaper
i
might
go
for
it
in
larger
quantities
but
i
am
not
so
impressed
that
i
would
be
dropping
the
money
for
it
ever
again
really
at
least
i
get
to
add
another
country
to
the
tally
served
in
a
pint
glass
the
beer
pours
a
clear
amber
color
with
a
very
small
white
head
which
goes
away
very
quickly
the
aroma
isnt
strong
but
it
smells
like
toasted
malt
and
caramel
it
tastes
the
same
except
theres
some
nuttiness
and
some
hops
too
mouthfeel
is
light
and
a
bit
watery
but
its
also
smooth
drinkability
is
good
its
refreshing
and
easy
to
drink
it
has
just
enough
taste
to
make
it
interesting
its
not
a
bad
choice
as
a
session
beer
if
you
wanted
something
that
wasnt
overpowering
but
still
has
more
taste
than
regular
macro
lagers
mouthfeel
is
smooth
and
light
with
a
fizzy
fast
moving
carbonation
easy
to
drink
and
refreshing
overall
this
was
a
pretty
tasty
lager
with
a
some
nice
subtle
flavors
hidden
within
much
better
than
your
standard
pale
euro
lager
i
could
see
myself
drinking
this
again
if
the
situation
presented
itself
check
it
out
if
you
can
find
it
this
is
probably
my
first
brew
from
israel
oh
and
it
definitely
cannot
hang
with
good
barbecue
trust
me
on
this
got
this
from
my
great
niece
and
i
appreciate
the
taste

but
i
wouldnt
buy
this
the
only
thing
that
surprised
me
about
this
beer
is
how
much
i
enjoyed
it
its
kinda
funny
to
me
that
this
beer
tastes
a
lot
like
certain
english
bitters
but
scores
so
much
lower
im
not
a
huge
fan
of
the
style
but
given
my
druthers
id
be
more
apt
to
shell
out
the
5
bucks
a
sixer
for
this
than
some
of
the
others
i
didnt
mention
put
it
succinctly
the
bang
for
the
buck
factor
is
high
i
definitely
would
not
purchase
this
beer
again
but
i
also
wouldnt
turn
it
down
if
the
only
alternative
is
the
american
macrobreweries
might
be
worth
checking
out
if
you
happen
to
like
this
style
but
otherwise
id
pass
my
chief
advice
to
the
brewers
would
be
to
improve
the
mouthfeel
i
found
layla
just
a
tad
too
watery
and
lacking
in
carbonation
otherwise
a
solid
if
not
earthshattering
brew
just
an
slightly
less
then
average
beer
it
would
refresh
on
a
hot
day
only
for
its
very
watery
taste
and
body
i
would
only
serve
this
with
food
as
a
last
resort
since
almost
any
pairing
is
going
to
leave
the
food
feeling
overpowered

malty

a
slight

taste
is
a
mild
malt
with
more
of
the
berry
sweetness
very
low
carbonation
just
barely
feel
it
on
the
tip
of
my
tongue
im
not
sure
if
its
not
supposed
to
have
a
lot
of
carbonation
or
if
its
just
flat
this
looked
interesting
in
the
mix
and
match
section
i
doubt
ill
get
it
again
it
is
fairly
smooth
but
more
from
the
wateriness
than
from
the
flavor
there
was
nothing
especially
bad
about
it
but
nothing
stood
out
either
its
a
mediocre
brew
at
best
a
pretty
enough
brew
golden
a
good
amount
of
head
that
stays
for
a
while
pretty
clear
not
unappealing
smell
and
taste
are
pretty
basic
some
sweetness
and
maltyness
not
too
much
in
the
way
of
hops
kinda
reminds
me
of
a
slightly
less
tasty
pbr
but
you
can
actually
let
this
guy
warm
a
little
without
being
afraid
of
it
mouthfeel
is
kind
of
bleh
nothing
exciting
overall
easy
to
drink
and
i
could
have
a
few
but
this
is
an
unexciting
brew
on
the
whole
not
bad
when
cold
but
probably
not
terribly
wonderful
for
what
youre
likely
goind
to
spend
on
it

well

of

and
grassy
hops
mediumbodied
with
a
sweet
malt
character
as
well
as
some

and

flavoring
the
finish
is
sweet
and
a
little
chalky
with
a
mild

bitterness
lingering
passable
overall

bland
and
rather
dull

with

i
picked
up
a

for
a
330ml
bottle
from
colonial
spirits
acton
ma
certainly
far
better
than
the
mass
produced
lagers
in
north
america
and
europe
still
this
is
a
dull
beer
which
might
take
care
of
your
thirst
but
not
your
tastebuds
d
lower
too
sweet
not
very
drinkable
it
would
be
better
with
a
mood
wish
we
knew
the
abv
but
this
is
tasty
enough
with
a
sessionable
character
to
it
sour
fruity
yeast
aroma
a
little
unusual
for
a
lager
foamy
lightcolored
beer
head
didnt
last
too
long
ive
been
trying
to
think
of
a
comparable
beverage
taste
it
almost
reminds
me
of
a
citrusapple
cider
mix
dont
get
me
wrong
this
is
a
very
good
beer
i
just
didnt
know
what
to
expect
it
was
very
light
would
probably
be
good
as
an
afterdinner
brew
drinkable
and
refreshing
altogether
a
decent
lager
also
kosher
m
d
very
light
but
a
more
pronounced
malty
sweetness
on
the
palate
would
love
to
have
many
of
these
over
the
course
of
an
evening
the
mouthfeel
suffers
from
the
biting
flavors
and
abundant
carbonation
not
impressed
enough
to
desire
another
hmm

not
a
bad
offering
its
basic
tasty
and
drinkable
but
a
cleaner
finish
and
less
metal
would
have
been
nice
this
lager
poured
a
clear
amber
color
with
fluffy
white
foam
that
persisted
and
clung
to
the
glass
the
smell
was
lightly
malty
with
a
touch
of
roastiness
though
overall
very
minimal
aroma
the
taste
was
lightly
malty
with
a
hint
of
sweetness
and
a
very
mild
hoppiness
somewhat
soapy
hops
there
was
some
adjunct
sweetness
and
a
touch
of
coffee
the
mouthfeel
was
smooth
and
dry
overall
with
mediumlight
body
and
moderate
carbonation
the
aftertaste
had
a
touch
of
sweetness
this
was
an
ok
lager
though
not
very
memorable
whiskey
and
water
colored
vaguely
sooty
aromas
combine
with
hash
and
burlap
notes
its
like
the
grains
were
smoked
over
a
campfire
on
the
palate
its
dry
with
a
splintered
edge
of
dry
wood
flavor
raisin
cookie
fruits
cant
compete
with
the
tide
of
watery
neutrality
on
the
finish
nor
with
the
dirty
bitterness
a
decent
dark
lager
nothing
id
go
out
of
my
way
for
i
saw
this
beer
at
my
local
store
and
was
very
shocked
to
see
it
came
from
israel
how
could
i
pass
up
the
opportunity
to
try
an
israeli
beer
even
though
it
was
a
bit
pricey
i
decided
to
give
it
a
try
the
pour
was
a
murky
copper
color
which
surprised
me
because
i
was
thinking
that
this
was
going
to
be
a
pale
lager
but
then
i
looked
on
the
bottle
its
a
dirty
blonde
lager
well
thats
a
good
way
to
describe
it
the
smell
was
nice
with
a
strong
toasted
grain
flavor
and
a
caramel
sweetness
i
noticed
hops
on
the
smell
but
they
seemed
to
be
very
weak
there
was
an
added
off
flavor
which
i
would
equate
to
dms
in
the
smell
that
flavor
seemed
to
follow
in
taste
esp
in
the
finish
the
taste
was
nice
at
first
really
caramelly
sweet
but
after
awhile
it
was
cloying
and
too
sweet
for
my
liking
maybe
because
this
was
an
older
bottle
the
hops
were
too
degraded
but
this
beer
definitely
needed
a
little
more
on
the
hoppiness
there
was
also
a
little
metallic
flavor
in
the
body
this
is
a
thick
beer
esp
for
a
lager
the
aftertaste
lingered
and
was
not
really
pleasant
im
glad
i
tried
it
but
im
not
going
to
get
this
one
again
a
decent
beer
here
pours
a
golden
orange
color
with
a
small
film
of
a
head
that
departed
into
the
unknown
even
before
the
first
sip
the
aroma
has
some
fruity
malts
and
has
a
nice
estery
quality
theres
some
hop
mustiness
and
a
hint
of
ripe
cherry
a
refreshing
and
lightly
sweet
body
of
malt
comes
through
in
the
flavor
the
body
is
flavorful
and
medium
to
light
overall
a
pretty
mellow
and
flavorful
beer
not
bad
basically
a
nice
beer
good
either
for
just
one
or
for
a
session
an
isreali
beer
who
knew
not
a
bad
beer
it
has
a
dark
amber
colorwith
a
nice
head
that
doesnt
seem
to
want
to
retain
all
too
much
a
caramel
smell
leads
to
a
caramel
taste
i
detect
slight
hops
but
not
enough
to
notice
all
to
much
its
an
average
beer
i
would
put
it
in
the
same
catergory
as
labatts
blue
this
is
surprisingly
not
a
bad
little
brew
from
israel
of
all
places
its
a
kosher
brew
to
boot
i
think
a
thats
a
first
for
me
methinks
this
may
be
tank
beer
repackaged
for
a
couple
of
reasons
it
was
in
the
tank
beer
slot
at
the
beer
store
theyre
both
brewed
by
the
same
brewery
both
were
referred
to
as
dirty
blonde
lagers
the
tank
beer
site
is
no
longer
functional
and
tanks
and
israel
do
not
equal
good
pr
these
days
so
they
may
have
made
a
name
switch
or
i
may
be
reading
too
far
into
this
anyway
to
start
the
best
before
date
is
cleary
marked
on
the
back
of
the
bottle
and
my
best
before
was
21
may
2004
so
this
is
seemigly
a
fresh
batch
i
found
the
brew
pours
a
decent
amber
colour
with
a
moderate
head
that
dissolves
waaay
too
fast
no
lacing
either
boo
the
smell
of
caramel
is
quite
evident
here
along
with
a
hint
of
toasted
grain
perhaps
the
taste
while
not
very
complex
parallels
the
smell
but
adds
a
bit
more
sweetness
and
a
bit
of
maltiness
as
well
in
general
this
is
a
clean
refreshing
brew
that
while
not
superb
is
alot
better
than
i
had
anticpated
id
try
it
again
in
the
warmer
months
mmmm
beer
a
so
tasty
overall
i
guess
its
the
antilager
syndrome
on
this
site
but
this
is
a
solid
pale
lager
no
question
about
that
the
nose
and
flavor
were
plenty
enjoyable
and
well
balanced
and
the
look
was
rather
appealing
as
well
a
good
lager
worth
checking
out
if
youre
in
france
probably
not
as
bad
as
indicated
here
but
a
rather
plain
take
on
the
style
the
pour
from
the
brown
flip
top
bottle
is
the
best
feature
developing
almost
a
nitro
looking
cream
head
above
a
bronze
tinted
liquid
the
nose
is
sweet
like
fresh
baked
desserts
all
lined
up
pie
crust
flavors
also
abound
with
minimal
hop
presence
and
a
bit
of
unfermented
sugar
left
over
in
the
finish
nothing
off
or
offensive
in
my
bottle
not
sure
why
such
low
scores
for
this
here
medium
body
it
drinks
pretty
well
but
the
finish
is
quite
sweet
fine
carbonation
and
the
head
has
lasted
roughly
the
whole
glass
not
everyday
i
get
to
drink
beer
from
france
so
this
was
a
treat
despite
being
a
relatively
ordinary
brew
o
look
elsewhere
for
your
beer
this
one
is
not
very
good
there
is
no
defined
malt
or
hops
just
meh
sweet
malts
candylike
caramel
buttery
theres
sourness
towards
the
finish
body
is
light
a
little
dryness
in
the
aftertaste
medium
carbonation
o
i
cant
believe
i
used
to
drink
this
stuff
well
not
fischers
specifically
but
im
sure
if
i
would
have
tried
this
five
years
ago
i
would
have
told
you
thats
how
beer
should
taste
no
its
not
i
was
just
looking
for
a
fliptop
bottle
for
a
light
caramel
malt
taste
i
do
believe
there
are
about
5000
beers
that
would
better
qualify
yet
i
have
only
had
maybe
a
hundred
of
them
i
guess
i
better
do
some
work
overall
a
good
beer
that
is
very
drinkable
it
isnt
going
to
wow
anybody
but
id
drink
it
if
it
was
put
in
front
of
me
again
i
received
a
30
beer
from
around
the
world
from
my
mom
so
far
so
good
and
i
will
definetly
rate
all
of
them
as
i
drink
them
o
are
you
sure
this
is
a
lager
the
bottle
says
ale
and
it
tastes
fruitier
than
a
typical
lager
that
said
not
bad
or
offensive
but
not
one
to
get
again
theres
a
reason
france
is
known
for
a
great
many
things
but
not
beer
really
not
much
good
to
say
here
it
didnt
taste
offensive
and
wasnt
hard
to
drink
but
it
had
no
balance
at
all
and
it
was
kind
of
hard
to
drink
14oz
of
this
because
the
flavor
was
so
bland
not
quite
as
bad
as
a
typical
macro
lager
but
pretty
close
i
would
have
to
imagine
the
ibu
of
this
beer
would
be
in
the
teens
i
had
never
heard
anything
positive
about
the
french
and
beer
and
this
beer
shows
why
pretty
clearly
it
just
wasnt
good
at
all
not
drain
pour
bad
but
certainly
not
good
enough
to
visit
again
i
enjoyed

would

it
again
d
one

this
would
be
a

a

for
color
just
not
enjoyable
really
and
was
a
little
too
pricey
for
what
it
was
id
probably
rather
drink
bmc
i
guess
its
a
decent
homebrew
bottle
drinkability
no
real
strong
flavor
here
pretty
dull
beer
goes
down
okay
though
pretty
cool
in
nose
one
feels
both
the
grain
but
also
citrus
the
mouth
is
easy
affordable
and
even
enjoyable
if
slight
level
of
flavor
it
still
tasted
citrus
sweet
and
fairly
present
level
of
language
and
where
the
malt
by
sips
we
feel
there
a
good
foundation
however
beer
is
no
basic
unpretentious
d
easy
to
drink
but
not
much
flavor
with
it
a
bit
to
watery
also
i
wouldnt
buy
it
again
drinkability
a
tad
simplistic
and
ordinary
but
its
goodly
quenching
as
i
sit
here
in
muggy
ga
with
the
ac
on
the
fritz
for
being
light
in
flavor
i
would
prefer
to
see
less
alcohol
but
its
no
big
deal
i
suppose
i
dont
know
about
this
beer
it
is
not
an
amber
ale
or
even
close
it
is
entirely
an
easy
drinking
thin
high
abv
beer
with
a
little
flavor
drinkability
suffers
greatly
because
of
the
abv
and
the
alcohol
prominence
no
reason
i
should
taste
alcohol
this
much
with
a
6er
d
dont
know
what
i
was
expecting
but
it
was
more
than
this
quaff
been
there
done
that
wont
be
back
not
a
bad
beer
nothing
outrageously
special
either
taste
is
about
as
crisp
as
a
sparkling
cider
flavor
is
a
bit
sweetsour
in
an
interesting
way
but
mouthfeel
is
quite
thin
and
theres
virtually
no
finish
i
wouldnt
say
its
dry
either
actually
very
drinkable
great
with
a
sandwich
good
alternative
to
a
soda
the
only
real
downside
to
fischer
tradition
amber
was
the
smell
it
smells
very
skunky
very
light
colored
pale
beer
with
nice
foamy
white
head
lightly
carbonated
not
a
whole
lot
of
taste
and
flavor
but
somehow
a
little
refreshing
a
bit
of
an
aftertaste
that
some
may
not
like
i
actually
like
this
beer
for
the
most
part
i
would
suggest
trying
it
hop
bitterness
doesnt
quite
balance
the
beer
but
does
keep
the
beer
from
becomming
cloying
while
offering
a
nice
herbal
tone
to
taste
the
beer
ultimately
dissapoints
a
bit
because
of
its
onedimentional
maltgrain
ratio
and
harsh
astringent
mouthfeel
notes
not
a
horrible
beer
but
slightly
below
average
d
although
mild
and
rather
lackluster
this
is
a
pleasant
readily
drinkable
dark
lager
aside
from
a
weak
mouthfeel
this
was
fairly
enjoyable
d
i
hope
to
never
have
another
need
for
a
swingtop
bottle
for
a
long
time
id
rather
not
drink
this
again
the
after
burp
car
tell
you
a
lot
about
the
beer
you
just
had
and
this
one
tasted
of
a
mimosa
burp
test
scale
of
15
0
d
about
a
third
of
the
way
into
the
glass
the
taste
got
too
be
too
much
didnt
finish
and
wont
be
looking
for
this
one
again
taste
is
worse
than
it
smells
very
toasty
malts
up
front
with
a
sugary
and
metallic
finish
harsh
alcoholic
notes
even
though
it
is
only
6
perhaps
this
is
why
the
french
like
wine
better
i
am
not
sure
if
i
will
be
able
to
finish
this
thing
mouthfeel
is
fairly
thin
even
with
the
nearly
cloying
malts
to
sum
it
up
cool
bottle
shitty
beer
d
the
rubber
flavor
is
off
putting
enough
to
rate
it
low
im
going
to
try
to
find
the
beer
without
a
swing
top
to
try
again
first
drain
pour
in
a
long
time
overall
this
1
looks
good
but
falls
flat
a
typical
euro
lager
cool
bottle
though
drinkability
i
dont
really
like
it
too
much
it
is
drinkable
and
i
am
able
to
tolerate
it
but
i
dont
want
to
mouthfeel
is
boring
and
the
beer
is
just
ok
would
have
been
nice
if
the
souress
was
diminished
this
was
the
best
i
could
get
the
best
part
about
this
beer
was
that
they
had
great
kolsch
type
bottles
but
22oz
and
i
got
5
to
take
home
from
others
in
my
party
poured
from
a
swingtop
bomber
into
pint
glass
it
was
a
rustygolden
color
with
a
minimal
head
and
a
little
lacing
the
smell
was
bitter
with
some
malts
some
bread
some
spice
the
taste
was
ok
it
was
cerealgrain
with
some
malts
some
rice
and
a
metallic
bitter
taste
i
finished
the
bomber
but
was
glad
it
was
gone
the
best
thing
about
this
brew
was
the
bottle
just
over
all
bad
beer
if
youve
gotten
this
im
sorry
i
hope
you
have
a
decent
beer
to
wash
it
down
d
there
arent
many
redeeming
qualities
to
this
beer
and
especially
not
in
the
taste
i
dont
think
ill
have
another
bottle
poured
a
bright
golden
color
ale
with
a
medium
bubbly
white
head
with
good
retention
aroma
of
cereal
and
light
sweet
notes
are
quite
simple
taste
is
also
dominated
by
lightly
sweet
cereals
with
not
much
other
characteristics
body
is
about
average
with
good
carbonation
not
bad
as
much
as
terribly
boring
d
ended
up
pouring
this
down
the
drain
the
flavor
is
just
awful
drinkability
its
got
nice
lager
drinkability
plus
a
nice
if
unconventional
flavor
i
would
definitely
quaff
a
few
of
these
sitting
at
a
sidewalk
cafe
on
a
warm
day
nothing
to
see
here
avoid
poured
from
a
brown
12
oz
bottle
has
a
light
brown
color
with
reddish
hues
smells
a
tad
sour
with
some
fruitiness
taste
is
sour
and
finishes
bitter
not
all
that
impressive
feels
light
in
the
mouth
definatly
not
a
beer
i
could
drink
all
night
overall
nothing
special
about
this
one
not
my
favorite
style
of
beer
but
this
one
will
wet
your
whistle
if
you
are
in
tune
with
the
american
craft
ambers
a
great
value
at
2
10
had
one
of
these
last
night
at
a
restaurant
and
enjoyed
it
a
little
more
than
i
thought
i
would
the
fischer
beers
have
been
on
the
shelves
for
years
and
have
never
been
my
favorites
but
it
was
the
only
interesting
choice
last
night
and
it
was
surprisingly
good
the
flavor
was
refreshing
mouthfeel
was
good
good
enough
that
i
ordered
a
second
one
not
good
enough
that
ill
buy
it
in
the
store
overall
this
is
a
better
bottle
than
a
beer
its
a
decent
brew
but
certainly
not
the
best
ive
ever
had
its
pretty
smooth
and
drinks
easily
though
in
the
end
fischer
tradition
amber
is
a
capable
enough
amber
ale
if
youre
a
francophile
dive
right
in
the
rest
of
us
will
stick
with
the
dozens
upon
dozens
of
american
ambers
that
are
just
as
good
or
better
bottom
line
unless
you
celebrate
bastille
day
every
july
give
this
one
a
pass
edit
make
sure
you
drink
this
beer
ice
cold
if
it
warms
it
becomes
very
astringent
yuck
overall
this
beer
is
just
plain
not
good
the
bottle
is
the
coolest
part
about
it
i
think
id
rather
drink
a
bud
light
over
this
one
really
bought
this
in
part
for
its
22
oz
swing
top
container
for
growler
pour
offs
yet
the
seal
seems
glued
to
the
ceramic
cap
not
sure
if
i
can
maintain
a
sanitary
situation
or
replace
the
seal
hmmmm
22
oz
bottle
poured
aggressively
into
imperial
pint
glass
head
exploded
like
a
shaken
soda
even
on
second
less
aggressive
pour
golden
twinge
to
orange
big
head
dissipates
but
still
leaves
nice
lacing
smells
dry
tastes
fruity
and
dry
like
a
white
wine
but
it
is
carbed
so
sparkling
white
wine
okay
drinkability
and
mouthfeel
big
head
belies
actual
smoother
feel
and
light
body
of
this
beer
i
could
go
either
way
on
this
one
poured
a
one
finger
head
cloudy
light
amber
color
sweet
hop
nose
mild
sweet
hop
taste
i
suppose
this
is
kind
of
a
euro
macro
beer
better
than
a
us
macro
i
suppose
i
had
never
heard
of
this
beer
but
alscace
i
believe
is
a
german
speaking
region
of
france
an
ok
beer
but
nothing
i
would
seek
out
this
was
a
unique
one
really
different
if
id
known
what
it
would
be
i
probably
wouldnt
have
bought
it
but
it
really
wasnt
bad
it
has
a
neat
locking
cork
type
thing
that
was
sort
of
neat
it
poured
a
nice
three
finger
head
it
has
a
sweet
malty
scent
not
unlike
several
macro
brews
ive
had
except
it
has
a
bit
more
hoppy
scent
than
what
id
expect
from
a
macro
the
head
dissipates
after
about
4
or
5
minutes
leaving
a
residual
eighth
of
an
inch
or
so
that
just
stays
around
the
taste
is
better
than
i
expected
i
really
expected
a
traditional
american
macro
but
its
better
than
that
the
smell
of
hops
was
right
theres
definitely
more
hops
than
in
any
macro
ive
tried
and
the
sweet
malty
flavor
is
really
quite
good
its
really
not
what
id
want
all
the
time
but
give
it
to
me
on
a
hot
day
after
work
when
im
just
tired
and
thirsty
and
give
me
a
hotdog
or
something
to
go
with
it
and
it
would
really
be
quite
refreshing
i
might
actually
get
it
again
just
for
a
day
like
that
d
not
a
beer
that
i
would
buy
again
conclusion
odd
but
not
bad
the
aromas
here
had
me
running
for
the
hills
but
the
flavors
while
simple
and
a
bit
strange
are
somewhat
tasty
actually
kind
of
like
a
mild
caramel
apple
the
appearance
of
the
beer
in
my
pint
glass
is
as
you
would
guess
amber
in
color
the
head
is
white
with
pretty
good
lacing
the
clarity
of
the
beer
suggests
forcefiltration
the
aroma
is
decent
no
hops
are
detectable
but
sweet
barley
is
yeast
esters
are
faintly
apparent
the
flavor
of
the
beer
is
slightly
bitter
but
the
malt
is
not
sweet
at
all
like
the
aroma
would
suggest
the
finish
is
dry
with
average
mouthfeel
all
in
all
the
beer
is
pretty
bland
and
flat
if
you
are
looking
for
something
with
more
complexity
skip
this
brew
all
together
pours
a
very
clear
light
brown
colored
body
with
a
smallish
white
head
and
quickly
diminishing
has
a
malty
nutty
aroma
reminiscent
of
english
beers
has
that
same
mallty
englishness
in
the
taste
okay
with
a
spicy
shrimp
boil
d
save
yourself
some
money
and
stay
away
from
this
beer
its
just
not
good
unless
your
into
rotten
apple
beer
final
thought
love
the
poptop
a
decent
brew
from
a
country
that
specializes
better
with
wine
and
creative
food
i
should
know
better
than
to
check
ratings
before
i
review
a
beer
but
sometimes
i
just
cant
help
it
and
i
have
to
see
about
the
proper
glassware
yeah
right
its
an
amber
so
youre
not
buying
it
huh
you
know
when
ratings
are
consistently
in
the
cs
across
the
board
for
a
brewery
that
you
might
not
be
in
for
a
stellar
beer
that
being
said
i
go
by
the
motto
that
man
should
prejudge
no
beer
or
else
he
might
miss
out
on
something
he
truly
likes
but
theres
only
one
way
to
find
out
so
here
we
go
a
bubbly
almost
pure
white
head
grows
to
the
rim
after
a
hard
pour
the
brew
color
is
a
very
light
amber
with
some
copper
hues
a
few
skinny
vertical
lines
of
lace
are
left
after
the
head
recedes
aroma
is
sweet
grainy
and
vegetal
taste
involves
some
almost
indiscernible
fruits
some
sweetness
a
slight
essence
of
bitterness
and
some
malts
none
of
which
mix
very
well
a
lingering
and
unwelcomed
booziness
exists
and
it
doesnt
set
well
on
the
stomach
during
the
course
of
the
session
and
actually
becomes
bothersome
mouthfeel
is
medium
bodied
and
theres
a
decent
amount
of
carbonation
this
beer
is
a
weird
as
it
has
some
underlying
complexities
that
seem
to
want
to
shine
but
theyre
all
so
subtle
and
unbalanced
that
any
worth
given
is
quickly
taken
away
in
spades
pours
a
super
bubbly
clear
gold
with
a
tall
tan
head
smell
is
not
appealing
has
the
same
almost
characterless
malt
aroma
that
borders
on
skunkiness
as
many
macrolagers
with
a
tad
of
zest
taste
is
not
too
bad
shockingly
sweet
malts
hit
you
fast
upfront
with
sugary
caramel
notes
citrusy
hops
on
the
finish
but
not
enough
to
balance
the
malts
light
body
is
fine
this
beer
is
drinkable
but
not
impressive
too
bad
because
the
bottle
looked
looked
so
appealing
dabilty
clean
drinking
slightly
belgian
styled
beer
though
it
was
an
ale
while
drinking
out
of
a
fliptop
bottle
this
beer
was
hazy
honey
gold
color
the
head
was
huge
a
threefinger
tower
of
cream
colored
bubbles
that
retained
very
well
as
a
cap
and
left
scattered
lacing
the
aroma
was
semisweet
a
blend
of
slightly
doughy
malt
caramel
malt
floral
hops
and
herbal
hops
the
flavors
started
on
a
sweet
note
of
caramel
malt
that
then
became
more
musty
and
earthy
the
hops
and
malt
did
not
seem
to
blend
together
well
and
produced
a
dull
effect
on
the
tongue
the
body
was
medium
the
mouthfeel
average
and
the
carbonation
average
not
a
bad
beer
but
not
a
good
one
either
overall
this
is
an
okay
beer
the
nose
is
far
different
from
the
taste
there
are
funny
perfumery
in
the
lingering
finish
of
the
beer
to
me
it
also
comes
off
as
kinda
skunky
the
mouth
feel
is
kinda
alkalinedetergent
the
finish
lingers
for
a
bit
i
find
rather
unpleasant
pours
a
clear
brown
with
a
13
to
14
inch
head
and
slight
retention
good
lacing
smells
of
a
euro
light
lager
mixed
with
some
odd
malts
since
there
is
yet
a
style
description
for
this
type
im
going
to
have
to
assume
it
fits
the
style
tastes
of
sweet
malts
that
are
tempered
down
theres
some
hop
bitterness
as
well
as
some
tart
flavor
low
carbonation
feels
almost
syrupy
not
crisp
slightly
smooth
but
feels
as
if
it
coats
your
mouth
reminds
me
of
a
cough
medicine
and
i
do
not
enjoy
that
overall
just
an
odd
beer
with
to
much
of
cough
medicine
resemblance
ill
file
this
under
the
good
thing
i
want
this
bottle
for
homebrewing
category
a
euro
dark
lager
they
claim
this
one
to
be
first
time
i
have
had
it
and
its
type
i
say
you
might
as
well
try
it
i
would
drink
this
beer
again
but
i
wouldnt
savor
it
to
me
this
beer
is
about
sitting
down
at
a
pub
and
knocking
a
few
back
light
to
medium
bodied
this
would
be
a
great
summer
heat
brew
still
tasty
in
the
cooler
fall
weather
d
certainly
a
drinkable
brew
thats
much
better
than
a
lot
of
whats
out
there
its
just
not
all
that
special
i
love
fischer
amber
poured
from
a
22
oz
into
a
pint
glass
rich
goldencoppery
color
average
head
lots
of
spicy
herbs
on
the
nose
from
alsace
so
it
actually
reminds
me
a
little
bit
of
a
big
spicy
gewurztraminer
solid
depth
of
flavor
and
just
totally
drinkable
sadly
the
price
is
just
too
high
these
days
for
what
it
is
a
solid
beer
that
is
totally
food
friendly
and
a
pleasure
to
quaff
d
this
is
a
very
drinkable
beer
it
goes
well
with
food
if
there
is
no
food
around
pour
another
bottle
the
taste
is
a
good
basic
lager
with
a
decent
zestyhoppy
pine
and
herbal
finish
the
taste
has
breadcrust
hints
of
wine
and
pine
herb
and
citrus
but
all
light
and
with
a
definite
thin
mineral0water
quality
and
body
it
is
however
very
pleasant
and
fairly
refreshing
this
brewski
is
strongly
recommended
for
a
light
brew
drinker
not
so
much
a
thick
stout
flavored
brew
d
this
is
nothing
more
than
an
average
massproduced
euro
beer
theres
no
real
character
or
complexity
to
it
not
the
worst
ive
ever
had
but
not
good
either

this
was
my
first
french
beer
and
if
this
is
any
indication
probably
my
last
one
for
the
price
of
this
i
was
expecting
a
bit
more
avoid
if
possible
if
given
to
you
for
free
just
smile
and
say
thank
you
and
do
with
it
what
you
want
d
nice
for
summer
but
the
smell
is
rancid
poured
a
clear
light
amberorange
with
a
large
white
head
that
leaves
a
nice
lace
down
the
glass
nose
is
interesting
to
say
the
least
although
not
unpleasant
it
is
quite
unexpected
ill
try
to
explain
the
taste
but
i
fear
i
cannot
do
it
justice
biscuity
malts
and
other
funk
blah
22
oz
custom
swingtop
with
a
smudged
bestby
date
on
the
plastic
cap
the
beer
is
a
mildlyhazed
ambergold
with
medium
carbonation
and
four
fingers
of
offwhite
head
that
i
can
tease
above
the
rim
within
five
minutes
the
head
recedes
but
it
does
manage
to
leave
some
nice
lacing
almost
no
aroma
but
what
is
there
consists
of
some
husky
grain
and
perhaps
some
adjuncts
very
similar
flavor
with
a
light
bitterness
and
a
touch
of
apples
in
the
finish
it
is
light
quite
dry
with
waytoohigh
carbonation
and
almost
no
aftertaste
just
about
the
only
reason
one
would
purchase
this
beer
is
to
use
the
bottle
for
homebrewing
as
i
did
but
the
price
and
quality
negate
that
reason
for
buying
it
avoid
unless
you
really
want
to
keep
the
bottle
boycott
of
france
continues
overall
other
than
the
mouthfeel
a
drinkable
brew
ive
has
far
worse
lagers
than
this
and
it
was
only
a
couple
bucks
for
a
good
sized
bottle
so
it
was
worth
a
try
d
a
very
drinkable
beer
especially
for
the
price
i
think
i
paid
1
99
for
a
single
serving
type
resealable
bottle
very
nice
this
beer
tastes
like
mickeys
malt
liquor
it
smells
like
mickeys
malt
liquor
it
leaves
virtually
no
after
taste
it
might
taste
good
with
something
to
munch
on
like
jalapeno
potato
chips
or
cheetos
which
i
didnt
have
when
i
drank
this
if
you
were
buying
it
at
a
cheap
price
i
would
recommend
it
for
generic
beer
drinking
but
it
is
not
worth
importing
from
anywhere
i
cant
believe
france
would
support
a
beer
industry
that
produced
beer
like
this
but
on
the
other
hand
the
us
supports
mickeys
malt
liquor
so
go
figure
avoid
unless
you
have
a
swingtop
bottle
collection
for
me
this
misses
the
mark
it
may
be
different
from
the
mass
produced
european
lagers
but
i
dont
necessarily
find
it
better
clear
golden
color
with
a
hint
of
red
big
frothy
head
that
laces
well
and
stays
for
the
entire
duration
lots
of
smell
coming
from
this
beer
but
none
of
them
are
great
smells
theres
some
sweet
fruit
hidden
in
there
but
mostly
american
macro
metallic
smell
it
gets
worse
with
the
taste
this
beer
gives
new
meaning
to
the
saying
rotten
applejuice
unfortunately
this
bad
apple
taste
hangs
around
this
beer
isnt
worth
your
money
if
youre
dying
to
buy
something
french
get
some
cheese
or
something
sink
i
have
not
seen
many
french
beers
so
i
tried
this
this
is
probably
why
they
concentrate
on
wine
d
i
could
barely
finish
the
four
ounce
sample
so
im
unlikely
to
want
to
try
this
for
a
session
brew
i
may
try
another
sampling
just
to
ensure
i
did
not
have
a
spoiled
bottle
d
starts
out
as
a
promising
lighterbodied
beer
but
ends
up
missing
the
mark
i
see
a
few
qualities
to
this
such
as
its
subtle
nature
and
body
that
leans
toward
the
lighter
side
that
make
it
rather
easy
to
drink
but
theres
not
enough
flavor
involved
also
it
comes
off
with
a
bit
of
an
adjuncty
taste
that
doesnt
sit
well
with
the
potential
this
beer
could
have
substantial
mineral
content
really
accentuates
the
carbonation
in
this
one
not
my
ideal
vision
of
fine
lager
carbonation
drinkable
but
little
to
recommend
it
this
is
bottle
4

my
six
pack

a

but
ill
be
damned
if
i
can

it

i
speak

very
average
had
a
very
metalic
after
taste
would
not
buy
again
had
difficulty
finishing
the
bottle
due
to
the
after
taste
the
best
thing
about
this
beer
is
the
bottle
overall
this
isnt
too
bad
of
a
beer
but
i
dont
think
that
i
will
be
buying
this
in
the
future
i
was
fairly
excited
to
try
this
beer
as
the
company
i
work
for
just
started
selling
it
thus
i
didnt
want
to
give
it
such
a
low
rating
but
the
beer
forced
my
hand
it
isnt
a
bad
tasting
beer
the
beer
just
does
not
have
much
taste
at
all
i
am
a
big
fan
of
amber
beers
but
this
one
just
lacks
taste
i
sense
a
general
lack
of
hops
as
there
is
not
much
of
a
smell
to
the
beer
either
well
i
guess
all
in
all
the
french
should
stick
to
wine
i
love
this
beer
750ml
bottle
i
believe
it
is
a
9
beer
and
is
fairly
available
nice
kick
head
is
a
bit
weak
but
it
makes
up
for
it
in
taste
nice
amber
appearance
smell
is
slightly
sweet
for
an
amber
the
mouthfeel
is
light
the
drinkability
very
smooth
drinkability
not
good
this
beer
is
worth
trying
but
comes
to
a
halt
after
that
being
that
this
beer
is
affiliated
with
heineken
im
sure
it
is
the
macro
staple
in
france
if
not
for
us
the
french
would
be
speaking
german
right
now
get
your
beer
right
its
steep
price
may
lead
you
to
think
it
must
be
really
unique
but
it
isnt
it
tasted
cheap
but
bombers
of
this
run
for
the
price
of
craft
beer
steer
clear
of
this
this
was
overall
not
a
bad
experience
but
i
was
not
impressed
it
wont
be
the
first
second
or
third
choice
the
next
time
i
go
to
purchase
some
brews
packaging
was
a
clear
bottle
which
knowing
the
effect
of
light
on
beer
i
always
find
disconcerting
unless
its

is
a

with

is

glad
i
had
a
chance
to
flavours
are
level
and
well
formed
not
the
most
flavorful
but
a
nice
czech
dark
thats
very
easy
to
drink
drinkable
fairly
enjoyable
in
a
average
sort
of
way
probably
because
of
how
easy
it
was
to
drink
not
the
best
czech
dark
beer
but
a
nice
offering
with
a
decent
alcohol
content
a
wellbalanced
taste
a
very
drinkable
and
easy
going
beer
with
just
enough
taste
o
overall
i
felt
this
was
a
solid
czech
beer
nice
light
roast
and
good
grains
solid
overall
not
bad
but
not
as
good
as
the
other
czech
beers
i
had
o
really
goodworth
of
trying
beer
o
a
pretty
nice
dark
lager
nice
a
wellcrafted
dark
lager
rich
and
smooth
a
blend
of
subtle
flavours
give
it
a
rounded
character
czech
quality
at
its
finest
definitely
worth
your
time
o
one
of
the
best
and
tastiest
czech
dark
lagers
od
nothing
overly
interesting
flavourful
but
maybe
too
sweet
i
didnt
mind
it
drinkability
well
balanced
equally
drinkable
lager
d
the
beer
is
very
easy
to
drink
and
is
also
quite
sessionable
poured
with
a
nice
foamy
frothy
somewhat
thick
light
tan

taht
mostly
lasts
and
a
little

color
is
a
very
nice
clear
dark
cherry

is
super
nice
dark
toasty
roasty
malts
a
little
cocoa
toffee
and
the
barest
hint
of
dark
ripe
fruit
flavor
is
like
aroma
but
sweetness
comes
out
a
bit
more
but
just
barely
subtlely
delicious
body
is
ok
and
carbonation
is
maybe
just
a
bit
fizzy
finish
is
like
flavor
and
slowly
tapers
to
a
medium
to
long
duration
session
i
enjoyed
bernard
cerne
mildly
but
its
fairly
simple
and
isnt
anything
to
write
home
about
an
average
european
dark
lager
that
is
undoubtedly
better
at
the
source
would
pair
with
a
pork
and
cabbage
based
dish
in
quantity
overall
one
of
the
best
dark
lagers
i
have
tried
i
think
even
the
best
drinkability
as
its
flavorful
yet
remains
light
and
relatively
low
in
alcohol
for
once
the
idea
of
a
weekend
at
bernies
doesnt
sound
so
bad
quite
a
nice
dark
lager
actually
ill
admit
to
being
a
bit
hesitant
towards
these
odd
imports
from
remote
places
in
eastern
europe
but
ill
cheerfully
try
any
other
bernard
products
in
the
future
d
the
heaviness
and
strength
of
flavour
make
it
a
bit
hard
to
drink
a
lot
of
the
burnt
molasses
is
the
main
flavorvery
sweet
with
burnt
biscuity
mouthfeel
light
alcohol
warmth
it
is
a
little
too
coyly
sweet

my
taste
glad
i
had
it
and
yes
it
was
worth
the
extra
wonga
other
comments
this
is
one
of
the
better
dark
lagers
ive
tried
well

a
try

two

three

four

the
texture
is

it

are

ok

a

one
dimensional
notes
highly
carbonated
thanks
for
a
great
beer
matt
an
unusual
masterpiece
thanks
to
georgina
for
bringing
from
her
hometown
from
the
resealable
cap
through
the
finish
this
style
turned
me
and
my
mates
on
my
head
why
did
i
agree
to
share
it
starting
as
a
tart
and
sweet
stout
with
roastiness
and
coffee
and
some
chocolate
it
moved
through
as
a
dunkel
and
finished
with
a
mildly
sour
but
beautiful
yeast
at
the
end
of
the
bottle
appearance
mocha

overall
not
something
i
would

again
i
can
understand
the
market
i
guess
but
definitely
not
my
cup
of
tea
or
beer
for
that
matter
also
im
not
understanding
the
cold
brewed
methodology
they
are
boasting
i
would
pair
this
with
a
nice
reuben
sando
or
corned
beef
and
cabbage
i
mean
thats
the
only
time
i
would
ever
consider
a
guinness
beer
it

extremely

great

and
no

first
time
guinness
drinker
here
cant
wait
to
try
more
guinness
i
am
not
sure
why
people
dont
care
for
this
beer
but
i
love
the
taste
and
the
smooth
coffee
smell
and
flavor
while
i
recognize
that
there
are
better
black
lagers
i
maintain
this
is
an
oldie
but
goodie
a
good
unique
beer
but
doesnt
rock
my
house
for
a
lager
pretty
good
while
drinking
no
doubt
its
a
guinness
light
for
a
dark
beer
light
good
quality
as
always
as
i
stated
earlier
we
very
much
miss
the
guinness
black
lager
with
the
holidays
near
we
are
looking
for
a
different
brand
to
replace
the
guinness
black
lager
here
in
fort
collins
colorado
ive
put
the
word
out

this
beer
is
not
a
bad
beer
just
very
bland
the
appearance
is
dark
black
with
an
off
white
head
the
smell
is
very
subtle
with
some
sweetness
coming
through
the
taste
was
a
bit
flat
there
was
a
bit
of
bitterness
in
the
beginning
but
the
rest
was
rather
neutral
also
not
a
fan
of
the
mouthfeel
which
was
too
thin
and
not
enough
carbonation
overall

dump
a
poorly
executed
dark
beer
i
didnt
think
id
be
giving
this
5s
but
i
didnt
expect
it
to
be
quite
this
bad
either
the
roast
flavor
is
okay
but
it
stays
too
long
and
becomes
pasty
on
the
palate
after
the
swallow
a
good
example
of
how
to
not
brew
a
black
lager
very
bland
beer
extremely
faint
flavors
roasted
malts
with
no
chocolate
or
coffee
present
good
excellent
beer
full
bodied
and
sessionable
everything
you
could
ask
for
in
a
beer
0
055
because
some
other
schwarzbiers
are
better
in
my
opinion
though
this
is
a
goto
beer
for
me
rjt
i
would
say
that
this
beer
is
not
terribly
sweet
but
has
a
luscious
mouthfeel
that
accents
the
subtle
flavors
that
it
does
have
has
a
brief
bite
from
carbonation
and
drinks
very
well
after
taste
is
brown
bread
o
people
dont
seem
to
like
this
but
i
think
it
is
a
decent
beer
overall
a
nice
euro
dark
lager
i
would
order
this
if
i
saw
it
on
a
bar
list
this
beer
pours
with
a
lot
of
promise
nice
foamy
head
good
colour
decent
nose
overall
there
is
nothing
wrong
with
this
beer
it
is
underwhelming
more
than
anything
else
the
roasted
malts
are
very
faint
and
there
is
little
depth
or
complexity
in
the
flavour
there
are
far
better
euro
dark
lagers
than
this
but
i
would
not
turn
it
down
if
there
was
nothing
else
to
drink
as
the
name
suggests
its
a
bit
of
a
darker
spin
on
guinness
stout
pour
yields
a
gentle
head
the
aroma
is
intoxicating
the
roasted
barley
absolutely
dances
off
the
beer
like
the
stout
it
seems
much
darker
and
heavier
than
it
actually
is
the
malt
is
balanced
very
nicely
so
full
of
flavor
without
feeling
too
overpowering
guinness
and
lager
do
not
mix
i
love
guinness
regular
in
the
pub
and
guinness
extra
stout
and
my
favorite
is
foreign
extra
but
this
guinness
is
terrible
it
tasted
slightly
like
guinness
but
it
just
didnt
hit
the
spot
of
the
way
other
guinness
tastes
lager
is
lager
and
guinness
is
guinness
just
keep
it
that
way
o
i
wanted
to
like
this
but
it
really
just
seemed
like
a
sweeter
black
macro
lager
to
me
i
could
easily
see
this
appealing
to
youre
average
bmc
drinker
if
they
were
told
to
drink
it
straight
from
the
bottle
and
didnt
know
it
was
black
poor
example
of
style
and
just
a
lame
lack
luster
beer
in
general
bottle
poured
a
clear
dark
color
lager
with
a
small
offwhite
foamy
head
with
ok
retention
aroma
of
lightly
toasted
malt
is
mildly
pleasant
taste
is
also
dominated
by
lightly
toasted
malt
with
light
dry
bitter
notes
and
watery
finish
body
is
light
with
ok
carbonation
this
is
a
waterdown
version
of
guinness
which
says
a
lot
about
this
beer
this
lager
pours
a
deep
brownish
mahogany
with
a
dish
soap
like
off
white
head
and
minimal
lacing
the
nose
is
an
unappealing
blend
of
malt
sweetness
and
an
almost
chemical
aroma
mouthfeel
is
smooth
and
creamy
as
one
would
expect
from
a
guiness
product
the
flavor
is
a
lack
luster
blend
of
roasted
malts
and
well
not
much
else
this
one
isnt
bad
but
it
is
nit
something
ill
be
returning
to
again
overall
imagine
a
very
attractive
women
with
little
personality
this
beer
looks
great
but
the
overall
experience
is
unsatisfying
dont
get
me
wrong
this
is
not
a
bad
tasting
beer
the
taste
initially
is
pleasant
almost
immediately
however
the
flavor
disappears
this
beer
is
chugable
but
aside
from
the
buzz
whats
the
point
this
beer
is
less
than
the
some
of
its
parts
hence
the
3
50
overall
rating
p
s
your
american
adjunct
lager
drinking
buddies
might
like
it
overall
this
is
what
i
expected
a
supplement
for
guinness
draught
not
my
cup
of
tea
if
you
know
what
i
mean
i
mean
guinness
was
just
ok
its
little
brother
is
gonna
be
weaker
the
only
plus
is
the
great
looking
bottle
and
maybe
less
calories
a
strong
guinness
character
should
not
try
to
coverdumb
down
their
signature
taste
guinness
and
lager
do
not
mix
o
it
tastes
like
guinness
light
i
think
i
may
prefer
it
to
guinness
on
tap
on
tap
it
tends
to
fill
me
up
this
is
easier
to
quaff
i
am
pleasantly
surprised
by
this
one
o
nice
clean
black
lager
easy
drinking
with
a
light
roasted
character
and
smooth
mouth
final
grade
3
19
a
c
guinness
black
lager
is
no
schwarzbier
its
dull
and
forgettable
compared
to
the
german
examples
ive
tried
although
technically
this
is
a
euro
dark
lager
so
i
suppose
that
comparison
is
of
questionable
fairness
that
being
said
theres
nothing
really
wrong
with
this
beer
id
drink
it
again
and
maybe
pay
for
a
pint
at
the
bar
if
i
were
in
the
mood
though
i
doubt
id
buy
it
instore
at
its
standard
price
point
a
decent
rendition
of
an
inherently
mediocre
beer
style
taste
is
the
real
weakness
here
its
very
light
thin
in
feel
and
character
with
thin
light
toasty
taste
and
not
much
else
except
a
hint
of
mineral
it
is
very
bland
onedimensional
finishes
abruptly
like
mineral
water
with
a
little
ground0up
burnt
toast
in
it
guinness
black
lager
poured
from
a
can
into
a
glass
dark
also
black
over
all
i
really
like
this
brew
not
something
i
would
get
on
a
everyday
bases
but
drinkable
it
is
heavy
compared
to
american
style
lagers
i
got
the
smell
of
a
dark
rich
beer
over
all
i
gave
this
brew
a
3
75
not
a
big
fan
of
guinness
brews
but
this
one
is
good
this
is
pretty
unremarkable
it
really
does
have
the
taste
and
feel
of
a
watered
down
cola
the
malt
is
there
barely
something
roasted
is
about
all
youll
get
out
of
it
its
enjoyable
but
mainly
in
the
drinkability
factor
i
wouldnt
recommend
this
one
mouthfeel
like
guinness
draught
and
bluemoon
it
is
very
smooth
leaving
a
refreshing
satisfying
feel
as
it
goes
down
almost
perfect
in
my
opinion
overall
not
a
bad
brew
i
would
have
this
again
if
it
was
offered
to
me
overall
im
not
sure
what
guinness
is
trying
to
do
with
this
beer
with
the
roasted
barley
it
starts
out
with
the
possibility
of
being
a
good
light
bodied
ale
it
however
misses
the
mark
starting
with
its
light
aroma
the
beer
starts
with
toasted
malt
promise
but
ends
up
being
with
a
flat
commercialized
beer
concoction
overall
not
half
bad
but
im
pretty
sure
the
only
difference
between
this
and
guinness
draught
is
the
yeast
they
use
i
would
have
preferred
a
guinness
draught
over
this
because
of
the
silkysmooth
mouthfeel
would
not
recommend
would
not
buy
this
beer
came
out
a
while
back
and
i
recall
getting
a
sixpack
and
destroying
this
in
short
order
while
doing
yard
work
it
served
its
purpose
admirably
at
this
time
now
for
the
formal
review
treatment
does
look
the
part
brownish
black
with
the
odd
red
twinkle
certainly
carbonated
like
a
euro
lager
bubbly
and
can
muster
a
decent
offwhite
to
vaguely
tan
colored
head
smells
quite
sweet
and
fruity
some
fresh
dough
along
with
the
requisite
dark
malt
aroma
that
in
this
case
recalls
stale
dark
chocolate
there
is
some
pleasant
roasted
barley
character
on
the
nose
though
which
is
of
course
linked
in
ones
brain
to
the
prototypical
irish
dry
stout
whose
fan
base
this
brew
is
intended
to
lure
over
to
the
lager
dark
side
palate
is
indeed
a
hybrid
of
guinness
style
roasted
flavors
and
lager
traits
including
aggressive
carbonation
and
some
lager
yeast
character
quite
dry
tastes
roasted
but
with
a
little
barley
sugar
sweetness
and
a
fruitiness
like
red
grapes
lurks
in
the
background
i
get
a
licorice
toffee
effect
somewhere
at
the
interface
of
grainy
dough
chalky
chocolate
and
the
aforementioned
sweetness
theres
the
odd
boozy
note
that
emerges
as
well
the
alcohol
peaking
out
from
behind
the
roasted
flavors
and
some
grain
husk
and
ash
in
the
dry
finish
a
few
offflavors
metal
and
cardboard
but
not
terrible
in
this
regard
i
had
the
same
problem
with
this
beer
than
i
have
with
its
more
famous
brother
you
keep
trying
to
taste
more
but
at
the
end
of
the
day
its
a
simple
no
frills
brew
could
be
better
could
be
worse
othis
beer
had
a
very
smooth
taste
that
had
no
real
flavor
overall
seemed
a
bit
better
then
the
last
time
i
had
it
which
may
be
due
to
pouring
it
into
a
glass
overall
decent
enough
for
a
black
lager
but
would
normally
prefer
something
else
while
it
may
not
be
as
accessible
if
youre
looking
for
something
in
the
same
vein
try
schwarzbier
as
the
roasty
characteristics
come
out
even
more
and
flavor
and
aromas
are
much
fuller
they
also
dont
necessarily
cost
much
more
than
this
either
overall
i
thought
this
was
decent
beer
and
a
nice
example
of
the
style
the
balance
was
pretty
good
with
all
of
the
aspects
showing
up
just
enough
and
theres
no
off
flavors
to
be
found
this
beer
had
good
drinkability
it
was
smooth
crisp
clean
not
filling
and
the
taste
did
a
decent
job
at
holding
my
attention
im
sure
i
could
drink
more
than
a
few
of
these
if
i
was
in
the
mood
for
it
i
like
the
taste
the
most
and
the
very
thin
body
the
least
i
might
buy
this
again
and
i
would
order
it
at
a
bar
if
nothing
better
was
available
i
would
recommend
this
to
anyone
who
wants
the
lightest
possible
dark
beer
if
regular
guinness
is
too
thick
for
you
then
this
might
make
a
good
alternative
all
in
all
this
isnt
a
bad
beer
and
its
about
the
same
as
a
remember
not
a
bad
choice
when
theres
not
a
good
selection
at
hand
o
im
glad
there
were
only
two
in
the
eight
pack
it
isnt
bad
but
i
wont
be
looking
for
it
this
could
have
been
better
but
taking
into
account
that
its
a
lager
and
not
meant
to
be
a
meal
in
a
bottle
this
could
also
be
much
worse
its
a
good
beer
to
bring
to
parties
thats
for
sure
and
i
may
go
get
myself
some
more
when
the
weather
starts
to
warm
up
again
theres
nothing
particularly
special
in
this
so
i
ask
you
to
use
your
discretion
but
i
enjoyed
it
to
good
health
and
good
beer
guinness
black
lager
however
is
a
halfdecent
example
of
a
dark
lager
its
dulled
forgettable
features
mind
you
are
unmistakably
those
of
a
very
hackneyed
commercialized
offering
as
such
its
best
suited
as
an
introduction
to
those
accustomed
to
mainstream
lagers
drinkers
already
familiar
with
german
schwarzbiers
and
quality
craft
renditions
need
not
bother
with
it
poured
into
a
pint
glass
nice
head
developed
semidense
and
tan
in
color
good
lacing
and
retention
aroma
was
a
milt
malt
and
coffee
with
the
appearance
being
as
expected
black
had
a
dry
taste
with
some
coffee
notes
mouthfeel
was
lighter
than
expected
almost
watery
dry
aftertaste
seemed
like
guinness
stout
light
to
me
final
thoughts
all
in
all
a
good
experience
but
world
shattering
it
isnt
its
certainly
something
different
from
the
brewery
well
known
for
its
stout
and
i
suppose
this
is
a
decent
enough
test
of
them
to
bring
stout
aspects
to
a
lager
worth
a
go
overall
meh
this
is
about
as
average
a
brew
can
get
its
not
horrible
but
not
good
either
would
particularly
recommend
o
guinness
black
lager
is
a
worthy
effort
from
a
legendary
brewery
although
i
didnt
find
it
extremely
great
i
would
recommend
it
nonetheless
if
guinness
bumped
up
the
carbonation
and
hopping
i
believe
this
would
be
an
excellent
brew
this
is
a
very
worthy
effort
from
guinness
although
not
a
traditional
lager
this
is
something
completely
original
in
the
lager
category
the
beer
is
not
as
dark
as
one
may
think
it
is
a
dark
amber
color
and
pours
a
nice
amount
of
head
and
lace
the
beer
has
an
earthy
aroma
and
taste
leaving
a
nice
hint
of
earthy
malts
on
the
palette
overall
this
beer
is
great
and
easy
to
find
making
it
a
great
choice
when
the
selection
is
limited
at
your
local
supermarket
im
surprised
that
guinness
black
lager
is
rated
as
poorly
as
it
is
on
the
site
i
thoroughly
enjoy
this
beer
and
if
im
ever
out
somewhere
that
has
it
i
almost
always
get
it
rather
than
whatever
i
was
going
to
order
before
i
saw
it
on
the
menu
this
beer
not
only
looks
cool
with
its
dark
appearance
but
is
surprisingly
smooth
considering
how
dark
it
is
it
still
packs
a
good
lager
flavor
though
of
course
its
not
traditional
guinness
but
its
just
as
enjoyable
to
me
poured
from
a
341ml
bottle
into
a
pilsner
glass
of
all
things
the
beer
pours
black
what
a
shocker
the
smell
is
faint
but
there
are
some
nice
malty
and
roasty
aromas
its
nothing
fantastic
but
its
okay
this
is
a
beer
that
is
less
than
meets
the
eye
for
sure
it
looks
like
itd
be
similar
to
guinness
in
taste
but
its
a
lot
more
milder
its
slightly
sweet
and
slightly
malty
with
a
very
clean
finish
and
no
unpleasant
aftertaste
it
reminds
me
of
waterloo
dark
lager
in
that
it
is
opaque
as
anything
but
doesnt
deliver
a
huge
hit
of
taste
thats
not
really
bad
though
this
is
still
a
fine
beer
and
id
gladly
drink
it
again
but
wouldnt
buy
a
six
pack
there
is
better
stuff
available
i
actually
liked
this
one
it
has
that
guinness
quality
to
it
without
being
as
in
your
face
this
is
more
a
version
to
drink
on
a
hot
day
it
goes
down
pretty
easily
and
smoothly
yet
still
true
to
its
heritage
tldr
it
went
okay
this
is
what
i
call
a
meh
beer
its
okay
but
nothing
special
not
quite
as
good
as
guinness
stout
but
a
decent
offering
by
guinness
brewery
appearance
is
dark
chocolate
black
with
a
three
finger
head
that
quickly
dissipates
to
nothing
smells
of
stale
coffee
plums
raisins
and
malts
taste
has
a
bit
of
dark
chocolate
with
heavy
plums
and
raisins
oddly
the
aftertaste
is
stronger
than
when
the
beer
is
actually
in
your
mouth
mouthfeel
is
thin
and
watery
overall
a
meh
beer
id
pick
it
up
if
it
were
cheap
or
free
at
a
party
but
the
stout
is
a
better
beer
basic
black
lager
where
theres
nothing
wrong
but
nothing
standing
out
either
i
wouldnt
say
no
if
passed
to
me
but
i
doubt
id
spend
my
hard
earned
money
on
this
one
several
bottle
samples
at
the
lcbo
on
wilson
as
i
explained
what
the
term
and
style
was
to
the
friendly
rep
they
sent
out
its
black
without
much
head
or
unfortunately
much
taste
either
its
not
up
to
the
style
better
than
the
stout
they
serve
here
a
bit
thin
and
overcarbonated
i
was
in
my
local
beer
buying
place
today
looking
for
something
new
and
grabbed
a
6pack
of
the
guinness
black
lager
since
i
like
black
beers
and
lagers
i
knew
it
would
now
be
as
strong
or
have
the
body
and
flavor
of
a
traditional
guinness
stout
but
that
was
what
i
was
looking
for
since
the
6pack
was
already
chilled
i
had
one
when
i
got
home
and
found
it
to
be
very
refreshing
and
drinkable
by
its
self
on
a
hot
summer
day
this
is
a
great
dark
beer
with
a
low
abv
that
allows
you
to
have
several
at
one
sitting
enjoy
in
moderation
overall
nothing
like
their
benchmark
dry
irish
stout
overall
a
tasty
easy
drinking
beer
overall
really
no
complexity
or
taste
only
tried
it
out
of
curiosity
and
you
know
what
that
did
to
the
cat
60
i
tried
this
beer
on
a
recommendation
from
a
friend
so
i
went
and
got
a
6pack
i
must
say
that
coming
from
guinness
i
was
expecting
more
as
far
as
taste
this
one
fell
flat
for
me
although
it
does
have
a
pretty
smooth
texture
it
just
has
a
bland
forgettable
flavor
prost
lampertland
nice
earthiness
to
it
i
dont
necessarily
like
the
price
but
it
might
be
a
bit
underrated
in
these
circles
overall
not
a
bad
beer
worthy
of
a
try
but
not
one
i
will
seek
in
the
future
overall
the
best
thing
about
this
beer
was
its
lightness
unfortunately
there
is
very
little
smoke
roast
or
general
complexity
but
no
other
components
came
out
as
intensely
offensive
at
really
any
point
in
the
tasting
things
just
remained
monotone
throughout
with
the
aroma
striking
overly
basic
notes
with
the
flavor
following
suit
the
feel
lent
little
towards
redemption
in
thickness
froth
or
coating
happy
st
patricks
day
but
were
reaching
for
something
else
next
not
enough
going
on
here
to
warrant
another
attempt
not
sure
what
the
point
of
this
beer
is
really
easy
to
drink
but
fairly
boring
if
you
want
something
like
this
but
better
stick
to
authentic
schwarzbiers
could
be
a
good
beer
for
nonbeer
geeks
to
drink
that
is
dark
but
not
heavy
and
bitter
ha
ha
like
real
guinness
a
decent
surprisingly
easy
drinking
beer
this
euro
dark
lager
must
be
a
relatively
new
designation
as
there
are
no
guidelines
listed
as
yet
but
i
am
already
a
fan
my
pour
created
two
dense
fingers
of
lighttan
head
with
good
retention
color
was
a
deep
dark
brown
with
garnet
highlights
and
good
clarity
despite
its
low
light
penetration
nose
had
the
characteristic
lager
honeylike
sweetness
but
in
this
case
married
with
a
light
roastiness
chocolate
malt
perhaps
i
wonder
about
what
exactly
constitutes
roasted
barley
for
them
mouthfeel
was
on
the
thin
side
even
for
a
lager
but
the
taste
was
a
pleasant
mix
of
chocolate
and
smokiness
along
with
a
mild
sweetness
i
do
not
like
cascadiandarkblack
ipas
because
i
feel
as
though
such
flavors
get
in
the
way
of
my
beloved
hops
but
in
this
case
they
meld
nicely
finish
was
semidry
and
the
mild
smokiness
seemed
to
linger
well
past
the
swallow
as
usual
i
would
not
want
a
steady
diet
of
this
as
a
selfavowed
hophead
but
it
beats
a
lot
of
other
lagers
not
bad
overall
pretty
mediocre
beer
really
started
turning
into
a
corn
bomb
as
i
went
through
the
glass
stick
to
their
stouts
i
hate
the
commercials
for
this
beer
how
can
something
be
both
refreshing
and
flavorful
i
hope
someone
gets
fired
for
that
i
bought
a
bottle
of
this
because
of
how
much
the
advertising
sucks
the
beer
itself
isnt
bad
but
its
not
memorable
in
any
way
more
bland
than
anything
o
i
will
not
be
getting
this
one
again
i
managed
to
get
a
6
pack
for
3
50
but
even
regret
that
this
was
very
lacking
and
did
not
have
any
of
the
guinness
flavors
i
was
expecting
overallwhat
can
i
say
about
this
its
okay
its
sessionable
beyond
belief
you
could
drink
this
all
day
with
out
much
effort
very
light
and
fluffy
tones
in
this
brew
really
the
only
thing
going
for
this
beer
is
its
drink
ability
3
i
wasnt
really
sure
what
guinness
wanted
to
accomplish
with
this
new
offering
but
since
it
strikes
a
perfect
balance
between
the
bone
dry
draught
and
the
chewy
extra
stout
my
guess
is
that
is
exactly
what
they
were
looking
for
a
beer
to
reach
for
when
you
want
a
guinness
but
are
put
off
by
extremes
this
is
actually
growing
on
me
a
good
session
beer
with
a
bit
more
character
as
well
as
a
great
companion
to
a
meat
heavy
pizza
or
tomato
and
red
pepper
soup
cheers

2oz
bottle
pours
a
colalike
black
with
a
bubbly
tan
colored
head
that
dissipates
quickly
leaving
some
bubbly
lacing
at
the
top
of
the
glass
aromas
and
flavors
are
similar
with
roasted
barley
chocolate
lager
yeast
a
little
bit
of
cola
in
the
flavor
also
thinner
bodied
finishes
clean
while
the
roasted
barley
lingers
a
bit
overall
great
drinkability
but
pretty
one
note
as
far
as
flavors
go
overall
average
ok
for
casual
drinking
but
it
does
not
have
anything
that
stands
out

o
overall
it
was
okay
at
best
i
dont
think
id
have
it
again
it
would
be
good
as
a
crossover
beer
however
poured
into
a
12
oz
sam
adams
glass
pours
a
nice
deep
black
as
advertized
with
a
short
lived
coffee
colored
head
that
leaves
no
lacing
aroma
was
minimal
with
little
hints
of
the
roasted
malt
but
not
much
depth
beyond
that
its
taste
isnt
bad
but
its
not
quite
as
robust
as
a
german
schwarzbier
it
didnt
really
have
the
chocolate
or
coffee
profile
one
would
expect
but
just
a
pared
down
roast
flavor
like
a
schwarzbier
turned
down
to
5
or
6
it
has
a
good
lager
mouthfeel
it
could
be
pretty
good
i
just
wish
that
the
roast
flavor
matched
its
dark
color
as
a
huge
fan
of
euro
dark
lagers
and
schwarzbiers
is
there
actually
a
difference
i
had
to
try
the
guinness
version
i
found
this
one
very
smooth
and
drinkable
as
they
should
be
not
the
sweetest
or
most
bitter
but
the
balance
was
about
perfect
sure
i
would
rather
have
a
draft
kostritzer
but
since
i
live
in
the
us
this
is
not
always
possible
right
out
of
the
bottle
this
is
a
great
dark
lager
which
would
pair
well
with
any
food
if
i
had
more
income
i
would
keep
this
beer
in
stock
but
unfortunately
in
the
present
economy
i
cannot
afford
it
the
mcsorleys
black
irish
lager
brewed
by
pabst
is
much
more
affordable
and
imho
has
more
flavor
the
taste
is
well
balanced
the
after
taste
is
quite
nice
too
with
a
little
more
bite
than
i
would
expect
overall
this
is
a
nice
easy
brew
and
vastly
underrated
a
verry
nice
lager
verry
balanced
and
smooth
pours
an
almost
opaque
super
dark
brown
with
a
foamy
dark
khaki
head
that
settles
to
a
film
on
top
of
the
beer
foamy
patches
of
lace
form
around
the
glass
on
the
drink
down
smell
is
of
dark
roasted
malt
char
and
a
sour
metallic
aroma
taste
is
much
the
same
with
a
dark
bread
and
metallic
flavor
on
the
finish
there
is
a
mild
amount
of
roasty
bitterness
on
the
palate
with
each
sip
this
beer
has
a
lower
level
of
carbonation
with
a
slightly
crisp
mouthfeel
overall
this
is
a
pretty
average
beer
that
tastes
slightly
better
than
it
smells
but
that
isnt
saying
much
my
first
time
rating
a
guinness
i
have
to
say
this
was
a
bit
better
than
i
thought
it
would
be
heading
into
it
nothing
really
stands
out
there
but
it
gets
the
job
done
not
sure
if
id
have
it
with
so
many
better
beers
out
there
though
overall
i
thought
it
was
an
ok
beer
there
are
definitely
other
black
lagers
i
would
choose
first
but
this
is
easy
to
drink
and
not
unenjoyable
overall
tought
to
gauge
this
beers
heartis
it
a
genuine
attempt
to
expand
a
good
brand
or
propaganda
riding
the
word
black
at
the
expense
of
arthurs
good
name
at
least
the
brewery
made
a
modest
move
by
staying
dark
with
its
first
lager
this
beers
strenght
will
be
in
its
weight
however
its
lack
of
roast
will
be
its
limitation
o
not
offensive
but
not
memorable
my
first
go
of
a
euro
dark
lager
that
im
aware
of
drinkable
for
sure
prolly
not
my
cup
of
brew
though
o
not
horrible
wouldnt
seek
it
out
or
probably
even
buy
again
but
id
gladly
drink
one
if
offered
to
me
freely
this
has
its
place
being
the
weak
link
in
the
guinness
winter
selection
pack
this
was
my
very
first
black
lager
and
it
has
been
a
great
introduction
into
the
field
i
look
forward
to
trying
more
since
trying
this
beer
very
pleased
this
was
a
good
change
from
the
usual
college
beers
hence
im
a
college
student
i
will
continue
to
purchase
this
beer
it
has
a
warm
malty
taste
to
it
that
is
welcoming
ha
i
tend
to
crave
this
taste
throughout
the
day
nothing
like
any
other
college
beer
bud
light
miller
lite
nat
lite
etc
furthermore
this
beer
has
kept
my
interest
high
into
beer
since
i
use
to
think
it
just
tasted
like
breaded
water
this
proved
that
notion
wrong
by
dispelling
it
to
the
types
of
beers
i
had
drank
before
it
i
know
im
a
novice
but
i
look
forward
to
working
my
way
through
my
beers
to
sharpen
my
buds
i
hope
this
review
helps
someone
another
toast
to
my
sink
drain
another
one
that
comes
from
my
parents
fridge
im
sure
itll
be
better
than
most
of
the
swill
i
get
to
review
from
there
guinness
black
lager
pours
a
muddy
brown
color
with
a
full
head
that
quickly
recedes
the
aroma
is
actually
very
nice
it
does
a
good
job
at
capturing
the
roasty
essence
of
guinness
with
a
nice
lager
twist
the
taste
does
away
with
most
of
the
roast
flavor
instead
presenting
a
solid
euro
pale
lageresque
import
taste
with
just
a
bit
of
the
roastiness
coming
in
on
the
finish
the
mouthfeel
is
thin
and
light
but
the
drinkability
is
rather
good
overall
its
a
slightly
better
than
average
twist
on
the
euro
pale
lager
perfectly
drinkable
i
wouldnt
mind
having
some
of
these
when
its
warmer
out
o
the
beer
is
easy
to
drink
but
really
lacks
complexity
and
depth
to
the
flavors
and
aromas
to
make
it
a
more
desirable
beer
in
my
opinion
also
i
thick
it
could
benefit
from
a
little
fuller
body
o
not
bad
a
pleasant
twist
on
the
regular
wouldnt
let
it
sit
around
long
though
i
imagine
it
might
get
too
bitter
poured
from
a
bottle
into
a
goblet
this
black
lager
from
guinness
is
pretty
good
the
color
is
black
with
a
light
tan
head
the
smell
is
nothing
remarkable
theres
a
little
hint
of
smoke
and
some
nuttiness
but
nothing
really
grabs
you
i
do
like
the
taste
its
less
potent
than
guinness
draught
which
makes
it
really
drinkable
its
like
you
get
all
the
fashion
of
walking
around
with
a
black
beer
in
your
hand
with
out
anyone
knowing
that
its
tame
guinness
is
a
lot
heavier
than
this
you
could
drink
several
of
these
in
one
sitting
i
dont
know
if
this
beer
will
catch
on
i
dont
see
die
hard
guinness
drinkers
likeing
it
and
i
dont
see
bud
drinkers
picking
it
up
but
i
think
is
pretty
good
o
honestly
this
tastes
like
a
bmc
style
dark
lager
only
the
hops
in
the
finish
save
this
from
being
complete
crap
the
malt
taste
is
way
to
dextrinlike
and
the
flavors
in
general
are
extremely
bland
i
know
guinness
can
do
better
than
this
bleh
overall
drinkability
not
a
bad
brew
still
not
nearly
as
good
as
good
ole
guinness
stout
great
job
guinness
keep
it
up
pretty
lame
and
boring
brew
unfortunate
that
guinness
doesnt
seem
to
care
to
put
out
more
of
an
interesting
product
oh
well
glad
i
only
poached
one
of
these
from
a
friends
assortment
box
the
beer
exits
the
330
ml
bottle
black
with
some
brownish
hues
toward
the
edges
and
a
modest
amount
of
foam
the
aroma
is
dark
malt
with
hints
of
cocoa
powder
and
charcoal
husky
grain
is
the
first
things
that
hits
the
palate
followed
by
sweet
dark
malt
malt
dominates
the
experience
and
there
isnt
much
of
hop
presence
the
beer
is
drinkable
nothing
wrong
here
but
i
would
have
liked
to
see
some
more
complexity
overall
a
pretty
terrible
beer
tastes
nothing
like
traditional
guinness
and
is
kind
of
a
watered
down
mess
if
you
want
to
drink
guinness
just
get
the
regular
stuff
i
had
high
hopes
for
this
beer
but
was
really
disappointed
it
almost
seems
to
have
a
metallic
taste
to
it
like
a
cheap
canned
beer
it
had
a
flat
mouth
feel
for
such
a
dark
beer
it
didnt
seem
well
balanced
not
as
heavy
as
the
guinness
im
accustomed
to
i
wont
buy
it
again
o
not
bad
but
there
are
better
lagers
for
cheaper
would
drink
it
again
but
not
buy
it
myself
i
would
appreciate
some
body
and
flavor
give
me
something
to
like
or
dislike
dont
be
messin
with
this
beer
man
youre
better
than
that
no
recs
to
listen
to
this
just
turn
on
a
shitty
radio
station
big
yuck
something
is
terribly
wrong
here
it
barely
tastes
like
beer
at
all
but
more
like
evil
cola
sweet
but
insipid
and
nasty
and
over
carbonated
i
am
not
sure
i
can
finish
this
or
why
i
should
this
is
a
mistake
all
around
this
beer
upsets
me
i
love
guinness
every
thing
they
were
and
still
should
be
what
they
stood
for
with
this
they
have
lost
alot
of
my
respect
they
have
sold
out
to
the
mass
market
guinness
is
not
supposed
to
be
for
everyone
im
sad
im
sick
this
is
like
metallica
singing
turn
the
page
cheap
i
understand
what
they
are
trying
to
do
be
relevant
current
what
they
dont
understand
is
that
the
timeless
rock
of
a
beer
they
have
been
brewing
for
250
years
would
keep
them
current
on
its
own
bc
it
demands
respect
its
a
fucking
institution
its
not
my
favorite
beer
i
prefer
more
aggressive
american
stouts
but
its
one
of
the
worlds
best
liquids
black
lager
is
no
better
than
yeungling
black
and
tan
or
1554
like
bud
with
black
die
in
it
poser
the
slogan
for
this
beer
is
if
you
are
a
pussy
and
are
lying
about
it
drink
black
lager
not
something
i
will
ever
buy
again
myself
the
beer
poured
out
very
smoothly
and
ended
with
a
pillowy
tan
head
and
it
stuck
around
for
good
while
the
beer
was
true
to
its
name
it
was
black
to
my
eyes
and
actually
looked
good
in
the
glass
for
being
so
dark
the
carbonation
was
high
leading
to
an
average
mouthfeel
the
smell
of
roasted
barley
was
strong
not
overpowering
but
it
did
take
the
place
of
the
normal
hoppy
taste
in
most
beers
it
was
a
good
difference
for
a
change
overall
i
have
it
a
rating
just
above
average
due
to
its
amazing
black
color
this
is
a
descent
black
lager
nothing
too
special
here
but
as
would
be
expected
its
highly
drinkable
and
easy
to
approach
the
body
was
very
good
clean
and
crisp
with
a
dry
finish
drinkability
was
very
good
you
could
easily
drink
several
of
these
low
abv
brews
with
wiping
out
your
taste
buds
overall
a
very
nice
little
brew
that
easy
on
your
palate
and
on
your
wallet
worth
trying
for
most
people
and
a
must
try
if
you
like
the
style
i
was
kinda
disappointed
with
this
beer
when
i
saw
that
guinness
had
guinness
black
lager
i
had
to
try
it
i
guess
guinnesss
regular
stout
is
kind
of
the
measuring
stick
for
anyone
trying
to
make
a
stout
and
was
kind
of
hoping
that
that
would
ring
true
for
this
as
well
guess
not
overall
the
body
of
the
beer
is
medium
and
the
finish
is
medium
as
well
what
to
think
about
this
beer
is
the
question
well
it
is
not
great
nor
is
it
bad
guinness
original
is
much
better
offering
i
find
this
one
a
tad
watery
for
my
liking
good
beer
and
easy
to
drink
ho
hum
o
would
never
buy
this
again
i
was
drinking
this
with
a
spicy
curry
and
it
made
my
food
taste
bad
i
could
not
believe
how
burned
the
beer
tasted
overall
a
nice
beer
to
try
if
you
are
just
getting
into
darker
beers
however
it
lacks
complexity
refreshing
roastedness
and
clean
finish
to
thick
body
and
moderate
carbonation
not
that
much
different
from
the
irish
stout
overall
drinkable
but
nothing
groundbreaking
by
any
means
it
has
a
decent
amount
of
bitterness
at
the
end
but
its
pretty
basic
tasting
other
than
that
i
wouldnt
buy
it
again
but
i
wouldnt
turn
one
away
if
offered
o
the
velvety
dry
aspect
is
nice
makes
me
think
of
the
easygoing
smoothness
of
guinness
draft
dark
berry
quality
feels
appropriate
for
late
fall
and
winter
taste
like
an
average
lager
with
some
roasted
notes
decent
enough
but
i
wouldnt
buy
again
overall
about
what
is
to
be
expected
a
lighter
bodied
guinness
but
guinness
strength
its
nice
creamy
mouthfeel
is
nowhere
to
be
found
thats
a
bad
thing
id
drink
it
if
offered
but
ill
probably
never
buy
it
again
especially
if
it
comes
down
to
this
or
either
of
the
guinness
stouts
picked
up
a
mix
six
of
random
beers
most
of
the
beers
available
were
ones
i
already
had
it
had
been
a
while
since
i
had
a
black
lager
and
give
it
a
go
cola
color
with
a
nice
malty
colored
head
the
roasted
malt
aroma
is
pretty
faint
it
is
a
drinkable
was
hoping
for
a
bit
more
out
of
this
beer
for
my
none
beer
drinking
friends
this
can
be
a
stepping
stone
for
the
style
pour
is
cola
in
color
with
a
thick
offwhite
head
nose
is
bland
but
a
bit
roasty
a
little
bit
sour
maybe
really
watery
its
hard
to
really
smell
anything
the
flavor
is
just
as
bad
its
almost
like
drinking
black
water
just
a
hint
of
roasted
malt
a
tinge
of
sourness
perhaps
a
light
earthiness
but
im
really
stretching
for
that
one
not
sure
what
the
appeal
is
here
o
not
too
enjoyable
id
certainly
prefer
it
to
a
yellow
fizzy
beer
but
when
is
that
gonna
be
the
choice
im
facing
glad
i
bought
just
a
single
dark
brown
but
not
quite
black
in
color
this
beer
has
a
tan
head
some
streaks
of
red
shine
through
the
liquid
when
its
held
to
the
light
the
aroma
has
a
touch
of
malt
a
little
roasty
dark
chocolate
and
faint
coffee
its
a
clean
smell
no
fruit
and
little
hops
the
taste
is
equally
clean
and
the
mouthfeel
is
smooth
some
chocolate
and
toasted
malt
together
with
a
medium
hop
bitterness
medium
to
light
in
body
its
not
as
flavorful
as
i
would
have
liked
nothing
offensive
or
wrong
with
this
beer
its
a
clean
and
tasty
black
lager
unfortunately
theres
also
nothing
particularly
exciting
here
overall
a
somewhat
weak
brew
it
is
pretty
one
note
but
it
just
seems
watered
down
o
this
beer
is
very
easy
to
drink
but
could
use
a
fuller
body
and
stronger
aromas
and
flavors
the
appearance
is
quite
deceptive
because
you
would
think
that
this
beer
is
a
lot
fullerbodied
than
it
actually
is
overall
we
think
this
is
a
beer
that
was
made
to
be
mass
produced
and
is
not
sticking
to
the
roots
they
are
known
for
its
refreshing
but
has
little
more
than
that
d
hate
to
keep
comparing
it
to
guinness
stout
but
its
hard
not
to
ive
always
been
a
fan
of
black
lagers
and
this
delivers
on
expectations
its
a
dark
lager
that
tastes
like
guinness
a
little
easier
drinking
if
less
satisfying
take
on
the
original
that
said
very
drinkable
again
light
but
with
a
nice
flavor
pours
a
very
dark
brown
almost
black
thin
tan
head
smells
of
brown
sugar
and
dried
prunes
taste
is
clean
lager
yeast
followed
by
some
mild
cracker
malt
and
finishing
with
a
tangy
slightly
roasted
coffee
finish
mouthfeel
is
average
overall
an
ok
beer
though
a
bit
bland
o
simplistic
and
thin
i
guess
this
beer
is
supposed
to
be
guinness
for
people
who
dont
actually
like
guinness
easily
drinkable
but
still
not
sure
why
i
would
want
to
oim
not
overly
familiar
with
euro
dark
lagers
but
this
was
somewhat
enjoyable
i
wouldnt
purchase
a
6pack
of
it
but
might
try
it
on
tap
or
would
choose
it
over
most
adjunct
lagers
if
i
was
in
the
mood
for
a
more
bitter
beer
overall
good
but
not
great
you
can
and
will
find
a
whole
lot
better
even
from
guinness
for
the
same
price
salud
its
a
decent
beer
but
nothing
to
write
home
about
guinness
is
mostly
overrated
to
begin
with
and
this
new
beer
does
nothing
to
dispel
my
feelings
its
something
better
than
normal
ole
draught
but
its
a
very
average
beer
fairly
easy
to
drink
a
rather
impressive
lager
to
me
poured
nearly
black
with
hints
of
brown
nearly
no
head
left
though
may
be
a
half
finger
or
so
taste
was
sharp
but
overtly
refreshing
beer
was
very
heavy
though
good
beer
for
repeadly
drinking
for
a
few
days
or
so
then
off
to
the
next
one
comparable
to
most
of
the
other
euro
dark
lagers
i
have
tried
the
mouthfeel
is
just
a
bit
too
light
but
besides
that
not
bad
poured
from
a
12oz
bottle
into
a
guinness
pint
glass
a
dark
brown
almos
black
color
can
see
why
they
call
it
black
lager
smelled
like
a
less
aromatic
version
of
guinness
nothing
really
jumped
out
at
me
flavorwise
this
bottle
had
been
in
my
fridge
for
a
while
so
it
tasted
a
bit
sour
towards
the
end
but
not
bad
overall
a
fine
beer
much
more
drinkable
than
regular
guinness
nothing
to
write
home
about
but
fine
if
you
like
guinness
this
would
be
a
good
alternative
for
the
warmer
months
o
this
beer
is
pretty
crisp
and
refreshing
when
cold
but
as
it
warms
it
gets
a
little
ugly
guinness
black
lager
pours
a
very
dark
copper
color
with
a
tan
head
from
a
brown
330
ml
bottle
the
head
is
leaving
a
thick
lace
as
it
fades
the
aroma
is
kind
of
bready
when
its
cold
there
is
only
a
slight
bit
of
roastiness
and
thats
it
and
its
not
much
better
or
different
when
it
warms
not
terrible
but
the
question
remains
why
bother
an
ok
enough
black
lager
i
suppose
just
lacking
a
bit
of
sass
in
either
the
crispness
of
the
grain
or
the
roast
or
the
hops
nothing
wrong
really
but
nothing
all
that
right
either
for
that
manner
it
does
well
to
follow
in
the
footsteps
of
its
much
more
ubiquitous
stout
brother
overall
this
beer
isnt
half
bad
granted
im
partial
to
the
euro
dark
lager
style
but
id
definitely
have
this
again
overall
a
decent
malty
lager
which
is
a
nice
addition
to
the
guinness
line
of
products
but
just
an
above
average
beer
unlike
the
classic
guinness
stout
though
it
looked
amazing
in
my
glass
and
smelled
wonderful
the
taste
was
average
at
best
and
it
had
the
consistency
of
water
i
have
yet
to
have
a
good
glass
of
guinness
here
in
the
states
hopefully
i
will
be
proven
wrong
if
i
ever
go
to
the
emerald
isle
overall
meh
about
what
youd
expect
its
guinness
minus
anything
distinguishing
i
absolutely
love
guinness
as
well
as
the
foreign
extra
and
i
think
this
is
a
great
beer
it
was
getting
so
much
hate
that
i
decided
to
create
an
account
and
do
this
as
my
first
review
it
is
very
refreshing
and
goes
down
great
not
much
smell
but
great
taste
and
aftertaste
and
easy
to
put
down
if
you
are
looking
for
something
lighter
than
guinness
overall
this
was
okay
but
nothing
special
not
very
flavor
my
brother
described
as
the
equivalent
of
an
american
amber
i
agreed
overall
i
have
to
mark
this
even
lower
than
the
macros
becuase
i
hold
guinness
to
hi
standard
and
they
fell
well
short
overall
nothing
too
spectacular
but
not
bad
i
prefer
the
original
stout
as
the
lager
is
a
bit
more
onedimensional
in
my
opinion
the
lager
pours
black
with
a
moderate
tan
head
that
diminishes
to
skim
yet
leaves
lacing
down
the
glass
the
aroma
is
mediumlow
malts
roast
a
bit
of
chocolate
and
a
bit
grainy
the
flavor
is
pretty
much
the
nose
mediumlow
roasted
malt
a
little
bittersweet
chocolate
with
a
dry
crisp
finish
the
carbonation
is
mediumhigh
and
body
mediumlight
overall
the
flavors
are
restrained
yet
still
there
decent
beer
ideal
as
a
night
long
session
beer
with
some
character
o
its
not
bad
its
not
great
its
just
there
easy
drinking
im
glad
i
still
grabbed
a
six
pack
of
foreign
extra
at
the
liquor
store
overall
its
an
ok
beer
if
you
want
an
easy
drinker
with
a
bit
more
flavor
than
say
a
bud
but
other
than
that
nothing
exciting
i
cannot
comment
on
the
appearance
of
the
beer
as
i
drank
it
out
of
the
bottle
my
son
bought
a
twelver
of
bud
light
plantinum
at
the
same
time
i
got
this
and
the
bud
was
better
it
kills
me
to
say
that
overall
pretty
much
a
typical
black
lager
nothing
here
to
make
it
particularly
memorable
overall
on
sale
for
st
pats
i
bought
a
12pack
actually
about
a
11
pack
of
12
fl
oz
bottles
for
12
99
not
a
bad
price
to
try
this
out
overall
i
applaud
guinness
for
doing
something
different
i
just
think
that
this
a
bit
subdued
and
safe
overall
it
wasnt
that
bad
just
boring
and
unimpressive
if
youre
a
huge
guinness
fan
it
might
be
worth
a
taste
other
wise
i
wouldnt
bother
poured
into
a
pint
glass
a
very
dark
black
with
almost
a
half
inch
tan
head
with
good
retention
smells
sweet
with
roasted
malts
not
very
aromatics
tastes
good
like
roasted
barley
a
little
sweet
and
very
litltle
hop
bitterness
not
a
whole
lot
of
flavor
coming
out
of
here
mouthfeel
is
smooth
on
the
lighter
side
with
low
carbonation
overall
its
a
good
beer
with
nothing
offensive
to
speak
of
very
easy
to
drink
and
im
glad
i
tried
it
a
good
beer
for
this
st
pattys
day
weekend
guinness
black
lager
pours
a
dark
brown
with
some
ruby
highlights
and
a
slight
tan
head
that
dissipates
quickly
and
leaves
minimal
lace
roasted
malt
dominates
the
nose
with
hints
of
chocolate
cocoa
and
coffee
peaking
through
roasted
malt
flavors
again
take
over
the
pallet
hints
of
coffee
chocolate
and
caramel
are
noticeable
the
lager
yeast
makes
this
medium
bodied
medium
carbonation
finish
crisp
clean
and
dry
a
solid
dark
beer
for
a
novice
drinker
or
a
beer
blogging
nerd
like
us
overall
drinkability
the
taste
makes
me
think
they
really
did
blend
harp
and
guinness
together
for
this
one
funny
thing
is
i
like
each
of
those
beers
on
their
own
just
fine
but
this
one
combined
its
just
ok
and
is
less
than
the
sum
of
the
two
beers
alone
ok
but
not
worth
having
again
this
beer
pours
black
period
there
is
a
one
finger
light
brown
head
with
lasting
lace
the
aroma
is
of
burnt
toast
and
anise
the
flavor
is
roasted
malt
with
nutty
and
phenolic
notes
its
mouthfeel
is
light
with
a
black
licorice
aftertaste
guinness
black
lager
is
an
okay
beer
slightly
recommended
looks
and
smells
like
guinness
stout
coffee
roasted
malts
and
that
ever
so
subtle
hint
of
coffee
but
the
difference
is
the
bite
its
got
an
astringent
feeling
that
i
associate
with
things
like
budweiser
coors
light
and
keystone
the
taste
is
basically
a
combination
of
the
stout
and
a
bmc
sad
o
i
thought
this
was
pretty
good
dare
i
say
this
impressed
me
more
than
the
stout
on
another
note
do
not
compare
this
to
a
schwarzbier
this
beer
is
not
trying
to
be
like
sam
adams
black
lager
it
is
a
lager
version
of
guinness
stout
made
with
the
intent
to
get
customers
who
are
too
intimidated
by
the
stout
overall
i
expected
more
but
maybe
i
shouldnt
have
theres
no
reason
to
think
the
makers
of
one
of
the
best
stouts
would
be
any
good
at
making
a
dark
lager
opretty
ordinary
if
its
trying
to
be
a
schwarzbier
it
misses
the
mark
wouldnt
recommend
an
okay
black
lager
wellbalanced
with
what
flavors
are
there
certainly
drinkable
but
i
would
rather
go
with
a
full
sail
session
black
or
mcsorely
irish
black
lager
if
given
the
option
for
a
black
lager
if
i
want
a
dark
guinness
product
one
of
the
stouts
would
be
more
to
my
liking
t
it
does
taste
a
whole
lot
like
a
lager
very
light
and
smooth
taste
with
some
light
flavors
of
roasted
malt
and
a
dry
finish
with
a
hint
of
coffee
not
particularly
offensive
but
nothing
id
go
out
of
my
way
for
comments
dry
and
very
drinkable
this
beer
is
a
good
introduction
to
the
dark
side
for
regular
lager
drinkers
when
they
want
to
try
the
deep
end
of
the
pool
the
body
is
medium
with
good
carbonation
overall
this
one
is
not
bad
but
i
will
always
choose
something
else
as
a
guinness
lover
i
was
very
disappointed
with
the
black
lager
i
really
wanted
to
like
it
but
couldnt
tried
it
cold
room
tempertureand
with
without
food
when
poured
it
didnt
have
the
cascade
it
didnt
have
the
rich
smell
nor
did
it
have
the
guinness
taste
it
sort
of
reminded
me
of
what
one
would
have
if
you
added
water
to
the
stout
and
the
price
not
worth
it
overall
a
very
tasty
black
lager
fairly
straight
forward
flavor
profile
tastes
like
a
lighter
version
of
guinness
stout
d
very
light
in
everything
but
color
not
a
lot
stands
out
other
than
th
beer
looks
really
good
im
not
too
wellversed
in
the
euro
dark
lager
style
because
i
dont
seek
them
out
but
guinness
didnt
make
a
bad
beer
here
not
satisfying
to
pick
up
a
sixer
of
but
im
glad
my
girlfriend
brought
some
back
to
the
house
dont
mind
turning
to
it
when
i
want
a
beer
overall
very
easy
drinking
and
refreshing
but
maintains
the
classic
guinness
character
disappointing
about
sums
up
this
beer
poured
from
bottle
into
room
temp
glass
the
beer
is
as
black
as
the
bottle
if
it
were
a
tire
mark
on
asphalt
id
call
it
not
a
scratch
or
burned
rubber
but
maybe
a
skid
lacing
was
nearly
absent
head
was
weak
and
quickly
dissipated
into
a
big
donut
hole
the
flavor
was
not
offensive
but
not
memorable
either
the
mouthfeel
frankly
sucked
it
was
watery
and
overly
carbonated
more
like
drinking
a
soft
drink
than
a
beer
i
wouldnt
but
another
unless
my
only
other
options
were
bud
miller
or
coors
the
nose
is
bland
maybe
some
faint
bready
smell
but
that
is
it
the
flavor
is
not
much
better
there
is
not
a
strong
roast
profile
here
in
fact
the
whole
thing
is
quite
thin
not
sure
of
the
purpose
in
adding
this
offering
to
the
guinness
line
the
appearance
was
interesting
looks
to
have
a
robusthard

too
the

all
thatbut
the
smoke
overwhelms
the

tasteor
its
too
watered
down
not
sure
but
i
felt
for
a
guinness
the
taste
is
too
diluted
overall
not
badjust
not
special
like
i
was
hoping
very
boring
lets
say
this
its
better
than
buttwiper
i
guess
it
was
ok
but
i
was
expecting
so
much
more
from
this
company
and
was
very
let
down
i
can
see
what
they
are
trying
to
do
and
that
is
build
a
better
beer
to
compete
w
the
american
standard
beers
well
they
have
done
that
but
was
that
really
an
accomplishment
or
an
epic
fail
fail
in
my
eyes
i
wont
buy
another
this
is
the
sort
of
beer
that
actively
caters
to
the
lowestcommondenominator
of
beer
tastes
ill
be
quite
content
to
never
drink
another
one
of
these
in
my
life
this
almost
make
raul
cry
poured
from
a
12
oz
bottle
into
a
pint
glass
light
black
in
color
ruby
highlights
about
a
finger
of
off
white
head
sits
on
top
not
much
lacing
to
speak
of
mild
roast
up
front
with
some
bread
like
aroma
taste
is
super
light
exactly
what
i
expected
decent
carbonation
not
my
style
d
overall
a
light
beer
little
smell
little
taste
good
mouth
feel
till
it
dries
your
mouth
out
o
im
not
trying
to
give
guinness
a
bad
rap
but
there
are
better
black
lagers
out
there
this
one
was
just
way
too
thin
in
every
aspect
d
a
little
tasty
goes
down
ok
not
too
filling
very
mild
kick
decent
representation
of
style
its
not
a
bad
beer
but
there
are
others
in
the
style
that
i
would
choose
first
compared
to
regular
guiness
this
is
a
lighter
beer
now
i
dont
mean
its
a
light
beer
but
its
easier
to
drink
and
not
as
heavy
as
regular
guiness
besides
that
it
has
a
slightly
darker
taste
a
very
refreshing
dark
beer
for
the
summer
o
not
something
id
buy
again
but
certainly
not
bad
either
a
good
choice
for
those
who
are
victims
of
the
dark
is
heavy
sterotype
a
guiness
for
the
warm
summer
months
o
not
bad
an
average
dark
lager
overall
not
a
bad
beer
but
not
my
style
either
i
guess
i
really
prefer
ales
this
one
has
a
decent
roast
that
may
appeal
to
newbies
but
is
easy
to
move
on
to
bigger
and
better

not

this
really
did
nothing
for
me
i
was
okay
but
not
spectacular
if
offered
one
by
a
friend
i
would
gladly
accept
and
drink
without
complaint
however
as
far
as
buying
goes
i
would
not
o
meh
at
best
the
strange
flavors
made
this
one
undrinkable
and
i
drain
poured
it
a
normal
guinness

is
a
thousand
times
better
this
is
just
a
failed
experiment
of
some
kind
maybe
im
being
a
bit
harsh
here

i
sure
expected

is
roasted
dark

barley
some
yeasty
notes
with
some
light

on
the
end
seems
a
bit
lacking
in
flavor
and
aroma
for
this
style
but
drinkable
overall
nothing
really
remarkable
an
average
brew
overall
this
is
really
unexciting
and
just
not
cutting
it
for
me
really
boring
with
nothing
much
to
offer
i
dont
get
the
angle
on
this
brew
as
to
what
guinness
was
trying
to
do
here
i
dont
see
the
appeal
id
rather
have
a
good
schwarzbier
o
not
as
good
as
guinness
draught
it
looses
coffee
and
chocolate
flavors
for
burnt
and
roastiness
not
a
bad
beer
just
not
one
id
buy
over
the
regular
draught
offering
would
drink
if
offered
one
though
black
with
reddish
highlights
and
a
fluffy
tan
cap
decent
head
retention
and
lots
of
clingy
lacing
mild
aroma
with
just
a
hint
of
roast
green
grapes
and
dry
maltiness
mostly
the
same
in
the
flavour
with
low
bitterness
faint
chocolate
im
just
not
a
fan
of
how
the
roast
and
malt
character
clashes
with
the
grapey
fruitiness
light
bodied
with
plenty
of
carbonation
this
is
pretty
middle
of
the
road
for
me
i
wont
look
for
it
again
though
due
to
the
odd
combination
of
flavours
malty
aroma
has
a
smoky
undertone
and
a
firm
yeasty
note
it
pours
an
opaque
darkchocolate
brown
with
a
thick
frothy
light
tan
head
malty
smoky
flavor
has
hints
of
molasses
licorice
and
coffee
texture
unfortunately
seems
to
be
on
the
thin
side
though
it
has
a
good
fizz
ok
but
their
classic
stout
is
still
the
best
on
tap
if
you
like
black
lager
drink
this
o
not
guinness
best
effort
its
not
a
terrible
beer
but
i
wouldnt
purchase
again
this
is
a
big
miss
for
me
poured
from

the
name
does
not
lie
it
pours
black
color
with
little
head
that
disappears
quickly
smalls
of
dark

but
it
is
not
very
strong
at
all
tastes
of
malt
with
a
hint
of
hops
has
a
good
amount
of
carbonation
but
has
a
little
bit
of
an
aftertaste
overall
an
ok
beer
drinkability
good
flavor
in
a
lighter
form
a
workable
alternative
when
options
are
limited
do
this
isnt
what
i
expected
but
i
dont
know
why
i
had
higher
expectations
pretty
boring
not
very
well
balanced
and
mouthfeel
is
unpleasant
i
swiped
one
of
these
from
my
dad
and
probably
should
have
left
it
in
the
fridge
for
him
black
lager
pours
a
black
color
with
a
nice
size
light
tan
head
the
smell
is
a
bit
cheap
has
a
bit
of
a
roasted
malty
aroma
but
not
sweet
the
taste
is
a
little
smokey
pretty
malty
some
bitter
and
hops
come
through
but
its
small
and
its
a
very
wet
flavor
a
bit
too
carbonated
and
not
sure
if
i
would
go
have
a
few
of
these
overall
its
not
a
horrible
beer
its
pretty
decent
has
a
cheap
but
trying
taste
it
just
isnt
there
i
hope
guinness
can
redo
this
one
and
bump
it
up
it
really
needs
less
carbonation
and
a
drier
taste
almost
there
but
not
quite
beer
is
medium
in
body
and
tastes
like
nothing
really
i
take
that
back
it
is
rather
thin
on
the
palate
finish
is
fine
unoffensive
but
not
bold
or
interesting
in
any
way
at
all
a
lot
like
guinness
probably
a
good
beer
to
convert
people
who
think
all
dark
beer
is
thick
and
nasty
there
are
no
off
flavors
and
what
is
there
is
plenty
mild
i
thought
it
was
the
best
out
of
the
draught
extra
stout
and
foreign
extra
i
like
strong
beers
but
i
think
the
bite
of
the
foreign
extra
ruined
the
taste
id
say
the
extra
stouts
better
than
the
draught
and
i
just
really
like
the
taste
of
the
black
lager
they
go
down
so
good
and
smooth
its
a
really
enjoyable
beer
overall
not
very
enjoyable
i
dont
really
know
what
to
think
about
this
one
its
almost
like
a
watered
down
version
of
original
guinness
its
very
drinkable
but
if
im
drinking
a
dark
beer
i
prefer
a
bit
more
kick
overall
drinkability
no
off
characters
drinkable
and
smooth
good
craft
gateway
for
bmc
diehards
d
this
is
a
case
of
where
classification
can
get
you
a
bad
rep
taste
is
more
like
a
edl
but
they
decided
on
naming
their
baby
black
instead
of
dark
its
somewhere
in
between
with
a
little
bit
of
weak
stout
dna
mixed
in
a
failed
attempt
in
my
opinion
but
i
know
several
people
who
really
like
it
still
not
bad
and
entirely
drinkable
i
just
wouldnt
buy
another
sixer
picked
up
a
single
for
2
poured
a
nearblack
brown
with
a
tan
head
huh
this
is
essentially
a
blander
version
of
guinness
draught
theres
no
sour
tang
and
also
almost
no
aroma
just
a
faint
bready
not
roasty
malt
note
its
similarly
bitter
through
the
finish
and
the
body
is
light
its
drinkable
and
theres
a
vague
cocoa
taste
id
even
say
theres
more
citrus
hop
flavor
than
malt
but
theres
not
a
lot
going
on
here
its
a
boring
beer
o
a
certain
step
down
from
any
other
guinness
offerings
good
drinkable
beer
and
probably
a
good
session
beer
but
nothing
special
slainte
and
happy
new
year
overall
a
pretty
good
beer
it
has
a
lot
of
promise
but
it
sticks
a
little
too
much
to
macrobrew
principles
to
truly
realize
its
potential
overall
a
sessionable
dark
beer
that
i
wouldnt
turn
down
if
offered
nothing
to
bring
me
back
for
more
just
another
tick
on
the
list
as
far
as
im
concerned
pours

nice

nice

medium

not
too
bad
but
still
would
not
buy
again
odhey
i
really
didnt
mind
this
one
i
gotta
respect
the
innovation
trying
to
sell
a
dark
brew
to
a
populous
of
beerwater
drinkers
hell
it
could
have
went
way
worse

settles
to

lightly
smokey
mild

with
some

the
flavor
is
surprisingly
weak
dark

and
caramel
maybe
a
hint
of
cocoa
thin
somewhat
bitter
mouthfeel
not
too
good
pretty
boring
overall
o
not
overly
impressed
with
this
offering
from
guinness
they
should
stick
to
the
original
the
feel
is
is
just
right
snappy
and
dry
lager
body
light
to
medium
with
a
smooth
creamy
finish
with
plenty
of
jazz
and
kick
left
to
make
it
very
easy
to
quoff
amazingly
easy
quoff
this
beer
reminds
me
of
the
guinness
draught
but
it
is
a
bit
more
flavorful
the
stout
is
my
favorite
so
this
does
not
stack
up
to
what
i
want
it
is
a
pretty
good
lager
and
i
would
take
this
over
any
light
adjunct
i
enjoyed
it
and
might
buy
it
again
pretty
good
but
for
the
most
part
i
will
stick
with
the
stout
overall
personally
dry
stouts
always
leave
me
wanting
as
if
someone
skimmed
the
top
off
an
imperial
or
foreign
extra
stout
and
served
it
to
me
this
beer
is
along
those
lines
less
nutty
than
a
brown
porter
less
roast
character
than
a
robust
porter
or
any
other
proper
stout
restrained
roastiness
more
in
line
with
a
dry
schwartzbier
if
you
like
guinness
draft
youll
like
this
was
pretty
hesitant
about
this
at
first
after
a
recent
trip
to
ireland
but
turns
out
this
is
the
only
guinness
i
will
drink
since
returning
to
the
states
although
it
does
resemble
the
taste
of
regular
guinness
it
offers
a
more
malty
nutty
flavor
that
is
enjoyable
best
guinness
in
a
bottle
by
far
im
slightly
disappointed
in
this
beer
it
is
not
reminiscent
of
the
guinness
flavor
i
am
fond
of
i
would
much
rather
taste
coffee
espresso
flavored
roasted
malt
if
i
close
my
eyes
i
feel
like
im
drinking
a
lighter
lager
like
a
bass
ale
harp
or
something
similar
i
would
much
rather
stick
to
guinness
stout
not
very
good
oddly
bitter
and
dry
o
overall
good
but
i
was
expecting
better
for
the
price
there
are
better
black
lagers
so
i
may
not
try
this
again
a
decent
light
lager
but
im
not
sure
when
or
why
someone
would
go
for
this
particular
one
overall
its
a
very
decent
enjoyable
beer
i
first
tried
guinness
black
lager
with
an
open
mind
and
knowing
its
not
supposed
to
be
like
the
original
guinness
hence
the
name
black
lager
i
liked
it
allot
and
i
am
not
a
big
lager
fan
it
has
now
become
what
i
call
my
everyday
drinking
beer
it
is
a
nice
dark
lager
with
a
slight
roasted
taste
overall
there
were
very
few
beer
options
at
the
event
i
was
at
so
it
seemed
like
a
good
idea
at
the
time
in
retrospect
i
probably
should
have
seen
this
coming
this
is
something
i
will
not
be
having
again
at
least
since
they
are
going
for
that
import
vibe
i
only
had
to
have
11
2
oz
of
this
failed
experiment
thank
jebus
its
cold
brewed
overall
very
disappointing
for
a
beer
brewed
by
guinness
there
are
so
many
good
dark
lagers
guinness
should
have
stuck
to
the
beer
they
are
good
a
brewing
and
it
wasnt
this
one
black
in
color
just
like
the
name
says
and
like
a
typical
guinness
white
head
poured
from
a
bottle
very
surprised
with
the
taste
it
wasnt
very
thick
and
tasted
like
a
very
smooth
lager
smells
of
roasted
malt
and
dark
chocolate
this
roasted
taste
is
throughout
the
entire
beer
and
makes
it
different
overall
im
not
especially
impressed
with
this
one
oh
guinness
stick
to
irish
stout
smooth
but
on
the
thin
side
nothing
offensive
but
also
nothing
stands
out
to
make
it
at
all
memorable
o
i
doubt
if
i
would
come
back
to
this
12
oz
bottle
poured
into
sam
adams
glass
head
gone
in
a
flash
and
no
noticeable
lacing
aroma
has
that
prepared
to
be
dissapointed
eurolager
vegetable
smell
although
if
i
dig
a
little
deeper
theres
kind
of
a
pleasant
honey
note
taste
is
pretty
bland
with
mild
roasted
malts
and
light
hop
prescence
thin
mouthfeel
kind
of
flat
a
little
dry
on
the
finish
i
realize
that
this
beer
was
not
aimed
at
someone
who
loves
west
coast
ipas
and
imperial
stouts
but
unlike
this
one
ive
found
most
of
the
guiness
lineup
acceptable
ill
probably
see
this
in
the
future
at
a
wedding
reception
as
an
offering
to
those
who
like
better
beer
it
does
have
a
cool
looking
bottle
but
id
probably
have
a
peroni
or
st
pauli
girl
ahead
of
this
one
pours
a
black
color
13
inch
head
of
a
offtan
color
great
retention
and
great
lacing
smells
of
slight
roasted
malt
sweet
malt
slight
pale
malt
and
a
hint
of
sulfur
fits
the
style
of
an
euro
dark
lager
mouth
feel
is
sharp
and
crisp
with
an
average
carbonation
level
tastes
of
slight
roasted
malt
hint
of
sweet
malt
slight
pale
malt
hint
of
hop
and
slight
sulfur
overall
great
appearance
good
blend
but
only
average
mouth
feel
and
the
aroma
and
body
are
lacking
overall
its
alright
if
the
flavors
were
stronger
and
it
lost
a
bit
of
the
carbonation
it
would
be
much
better
refreshing
but
not
very
tasty
just
did
not
work
for
me
cannot
see
buying
this
again
o
not
your
fathers
guinness
frankly
the
classic
versions
are
much
better
no
need
for
me
to
have
another
of
black
lager
when
the
original
still
exists
cheers
o
alright
i
guess
i
could
see
drinking
this
now
and
again
but
its
not
my
favorite
rough
all
around
despite
the
ups
and
its
only
a
matter
of
time
till
my
palate
cant
take
anymore
im
craving
an
eisenbahn
dunkel
to
revive
my
mind
o
overall
a
pretty
decent
beer
looks
like
i
like
this
one
more
than
most
if
youre
looking
for
a
beer
like
guinness
irish
dry
stouts
this
isnt
it
as
it
is
more
of
an
easy
drinking
lager
but
i
liked
it
lots
of
roasted
malts
and
some
nice
fruit
in
the
taste
as
well
id
have
it
again
guinness
is
trying
to
expand
and
maybe
this
will
reach
those
uneducated
beer
drinkers
that
still
describe
guinness
draught
as
a
heavy
beer
when
they
notice
the
more
common
word
lager
but
when
it
comes
down
to
it
im
still
reaching
for
a
guinness
draught
if
i
want
a
stout
or
a
saranacsam
adams
if
i
want
a
lager
overall
not
a
bad
beer
and
certainly
above
average
for
the
style
i
could
see
myself
getting
a
glass
or
two
again
probably
my
least
favorite
from
the
brewery
try
to
grade
against
others
i
have
had
in
the
style
if
i
was
not
this
beer
would
be
closer
to
a
c
personally
i
believe
that
guinness
needs
to
be
very
careful
when
releasing
beers
i
love
normal
guinness
and
i
always
thought
they
could
build
their
beers
off
of
that
it
seems
they
started
from
scratch
maybe
this
is
the
miller
lite
of
guinness
but
if
that
is
the
case
they
should
charge
15
a
case
o
light
euro
lager
for
dark
beer
enthusiasts
not
sure
what
guinness
ltd
was
thinking
here
but
this
beer
is
very
unimpressive
do
not
expect
schwartzbier
flavors
but
rather
something
on
par
with
becks
dark
perhaps
id
pass
again
and
wil
continue
to
wonder
about
why
this
beer
exists
drinkability
this
is
an
easygoing
beer
that
wont
impress
anyone
but
will
stay
out
of
the
sink
black
in
color
with
a
tan
head
with
minium
retention
and
lacing
in
the
glass
the
smell
is
pretty
lack
luster
no
major
aromas
of
anything
the
taste
of
this
beet
was
pretty
plain
no
great
strong
flavors
that
i
was
hoping
for
in
this
beer
the
mouthfeel
was
also
very
light
and
watery
this
would
be
refreshing
to
have
maybe
one
or
two
but
not
to
sit
down
and
really
enjoy
a
beer
overall
this
beer
was
ok
but
it
was
pretty
much
a
major
let
down
from
what
i
was
expecting
uninspired
and
uninteresting
there
are
better
beers
out
there
that
deserve
your
money
the
taste
is
good
but
not
really
impressive
i
mean
it
is
clean
and
slightly
mineral
in
character
with
light
lager
yeast
flavor
and
subtle
toasted
malt
verging
on
roast
notes
with
a
light
hop
bitterness
to
accent
the
malt
the
finish
is
dry
and
has
only
the
slightest
amount
of
sweetness
this
is
a
pretty
decent
lager
but
doesnt
really
do
anything
to
differentiate
itself
from
the
rest
other
than
to
be
well
brewed
without
many
flaws
that
are
noticeable
i
would
drink
this
again
since
it
is
a
good
value
for
the
price
and
i
am
a
fan
of
the
style
color
is
black
with
an
almost
brown
bubbly
head
that
leaves
a
good
deal
of
lacing
the
rest
not
very
good
more
black
water
than
black
lager
wouldnt
waste
my
time
with
this
one
again
the
beer
is
totally
black
or
maybe
so
dark
brown
that
i
cant
tell
the
difference
it
has
nice
carbonation
but
the
weak
and
quickly
dissapearing
head
is
dissapointing
maybe
its
my
bottle
but
there
is
an
overpowering
metal
smell
mixed
with
a
very
faint
but
nice
roastiness
the
taste
also
had
a
faint
mild
roastinesswith
possibly
a
hint
of
molasses
kind
of
reminding
me
of
a
mild
brown
beer
because
its
a
bit
bland
the
beer
is
so
easy
to
drink
and
i
love
the
carbonation
on
my
tongue
its
mild
to
medium
body
with
the
really
great
mouthfeel
makes
me
want
to
swish
the
beer
around
my
mouth
before
swallowing
this
beer
is
ideal
for
a
thirst
quencher
on
a
hot
day
but
a
lot
of
times
ill
prefer
something
much
bolder
this
is
a
medium
bodied
brew
with
a
modest
amount
of
carbonation
perhaps
its
best
attributes
are
the
aroma
and
crispness
to
its
finish
the
taste
really
left
me
expectingwanting
more
character
it
is
easy
drinking
and
overall
quite
a
forgettable
experience
d
highly
drinkable
as
it
is
low
abv
and
drinks
very
very
easily

guinness
brews
becks
dark
perfectly
fine
dunkel
i
was
worried
it
might
somehow
be
some
sort
of
off
light
stout
but
no
it
really
does
taste
like
a
german
dark
lager
to
those
asking
why
well
why
not
except
the
usual
guinness
premium
price
tag
i
picked
up
a
sixpack
of
this
for
7
in
nh
which
was
why
i
tried
it
not
worth
any
extra
outlay
if
the
becks
is
there
and
cheaper
but
if
you
can
find
it
cheap
try
it
lesson
learned
dont
judge
a
brew
by
how
it
looks
in
the
pint
glass
a
c
brew
especially
on
a
morning
that
is
27
degrees
o
very
sessionable
lager
better
than
i
expected
this
is
a
very
poor
outing
and
likely
my
one
and
only
time
trying
this
beer
thin
and
watery
a
sour
astringent
taste
and
poor
acidic
aftertaste
i
love
guinness
stout
but
this
is
not
a
winner
black
liquid
with
a
thin
offwhite
head
aromas
of
roasted
grain
and
yeast
with
a
hint
of
chocolate
toasted
chocolate
flavor
with
crisp
grains
and
seltzer
light
hints
of
caramel
and
cola
has
a
light
easydrinking
body
despite
looking
like
something
that
should
be
much
thicker
ill
definitely
be
drinking
this
again
poured
from
a
brown
11
2
oz
bottle
has
a
black
color
with
a
12
inch
head
smell
is
of
roasted
malts
taste
is
mild
some
malts
a
touch
of
bitterness
at
the
finish
not
very
flavorful
feels
light
in
the
mouth
and
overall
is
a
decent
but
unspectacular
beer
o
4
o
not
good
nuff
said
overall
very
drinakable
and
not
bad
at
all
though
i
think
i
would
rather
just
have
a
guinness
like
many
have
said
im
not
sure
what
the
point
of
this
beer
is
as
regular
guinness
is
much
better
and
not
heavy
perhaps
the
idea
that
guinness
is
too
heavy
prompted
the
creation
of
this
one
just
ok
but
there
are
much
better
options
out
there
in
just
about
every
category
o
theres
not
much
substance
to
it
its
easy
to
kick
some
back
but
theres
nothing
worth
remembering
here
d
overall
a
very
light
beer
that
has
a
nice
if
watery
maltiness
to
it
not
something
to
marvel
at
but
its
an
easy
drinking
beer
when
youre
feeling
thirsty
overall
this
beer
drinks
easy
and
tastes
alright
but
its
simple
so
if
youre
expecting
a
lot
you
wont
find
it
here
well
this
is
just
bad
it
is
not
that
it
has
poor
taste
it
just
has
no
taste
it
has
a
dark
look
with
a
decent
pour
to
it
but
that
is
where
it
ends
it
is
a
water
tasting
lackluster
attempt
by
guinness
very
disappointing
i
would
say
to
pass
on
this
if
your
in
a
guinness
mood
and
get
the
stout
and
nothing
more
oit
feels
like
every
part
of
the
flavor
restrained
in
this
beer
i
dont
dislike
this
beer
but
im
not
sure
i
would
seek
it
out
again
poured
into
a
weisse
vase
the
beer
pours
jet
black
with
a
large
foamy
cascade
that
is
like
watching
a
guinness
stout
cascade
on
fastforward
you
end
up
with
a
huge
chunky
airy
foamy
light
brown
head
that
starts
around
two
inches
but
settles
into
an
uneven
covering
sparse
lacing
along
the
glass
as
the
head
settles
aromas
are
clean
with
a
dark
roasted
scent
riding
alongside
a
grainy
nose
flavors
are
rich
with
a
roasted
almost
charred
flavor
throughout
the
backbone
and
a
bitter
light
hopping
at
the
end
also
the
beer
has
hints
of
coffee
throughout
the
aftertaste
is
short
and
sweet
with
a
round
sweet
somewhat
nutty
flavor
to
it
very
clean
smooth
finish
interesting
brew
from
the
guinness
company
poured
into
my
guinness
pint
glass
with
a
frothty
tan
head
with
thick
foamy
lacing
dark
brown
not
as
black
as
the
stout
very
earthy
aroma
with
hints
of
raisins
flavors
of
coffee
dirt
and
smoke
nice
light
flavor
and
easy
to
drink
a
little
bitter
at
the
end
id
rather
drink
the
stout
and
i
do
not
agree
with
the
comercial
of
this
beer
making
people
enjoy
a
dark
beer
o
just
barely
average
wont
buy
again
unless
confronted
by
competing
macro
lager
swill
o
this
brew
is
on
par
with
their
trademark
stout
good
but
not
great
just
kinda
middle
of
the
road
i
was
a
little
disappointed
by
guinnesss
take
on
black
lager
but
its
not
bad
pours
out
black
held
up
to
a
light
some
red
hues
shine
through
smell
is
really
pale
some
roasted
hints
taste
is
also
really
pale
nothing
offensive
here
at
all
just
really
watery
some
roasted
taste
hidden
in
the
back
mouthfeel
is
like
water
overall
not
horrible
but
i
would
much
rather
enjoy
a
typical
guinness
overall
this
is
passable
and
i
drank
the
whole
bottle
i
cant
say
it
was
all
that
enjoyable
though
i
wouldnt
search
this
one
out
head
disappeared
to
a
lace
nose
is
roasted
malt
much
like
regular
guinness
flavor
us
of
roasted
malt
and
enough
hop
to
dry
off
the
tongue
harder
carbonation
then
regular
guinness
lighter
mouthfeel
than
guinness
refreshing
marketed
to
a
light
beer
drinker
that
wants
to
look
like
a
good
beer
drinker
looks
like
light
guinness
smells
like
light
guinness
tastes
like
light
guinness
you
do
the
math
not
bad
better
i
think
then
the
other
reviews
state
i
could
drink
this
all
night
but
then
again
i
could
drink
guinness
all
night
so
there
isnt
too
much
point
to
buying
more
of
these
ill
just
buy
the
regular
black
stuff
side
note
went
really
well
with
horseradish
cheddar
rated
via
beers
advocate
for
iphone
overall
a
disappointment
as
far
as
black
lagers
go
there
are
much
better
domestic
versions
of
the
dark
lager
variety
so
there
isnt
much
impetus
to
ever
revisit
this
again
o
im
not
a
big
fan
of
this
and
dont
think
ill
revisit
it
overall
the
only
thing
this
beer
has
going
for
it
is
the
aroma
which
is
misleading
this
is
a
big
mistake
and
is
a
pointless
beer
imo
scrap
the
losses
in
marketing
and
go
back
to
making
stouts
guinness
overall
i
was
expecting
to
be
disappointed
from
reading
other
reviews
but
i
thought
this
was
a
decent
drinker
smooth
goes
good
with
swiss
cheese
sam
adams
black
lager
is
a
bit
better
but
i
have
no
complaints
with
this
guinness
version
it
wont
win
any
stout
drinkers
away
from
the
guinness
mother
ship
has
a
very
strong
chemical
odor
to
it
hits
the
tongue
with
a
nice
crisp
kick
then
descends
into
chemical
bitterness
the
aftertaste
is
hard
to
describe
but
easy
to
explain
awful
really
surprising
from
guinness
the
initial
taste
and
aroma
are
very
romising
but
soon
after
the
initial
taste
everything
falls
apart
if
i
had
to
give
a
difference
between
this
and
guinness
stout
the
black
lager
is
a
little
more
watered
down
but
not
in
a
bad
way
it
is
almost
more
crisp
and
refreshing
but
with
still
some
of
the
roasty
malted
characteristic
of
the
stout
that
said
though
it
is
pretty
average
across
the
board
it
would
be
an
easy
one
to
pound
back
a
lot
of
i
say
that
about
a
lot
of
average
but
not
bad
beers
if
you
were
in
the
mood
for
some
dark
beer
but
nothing
i
will
buy
again
overall
the
black
lager
is
different
enough
from
the
stout
but
not
really
distinguishing
enough
to
ever
make
it
as
popular
as
what
guinness
is
known
for
too
average
to
convert
anyone
i
think
and
i
doubt
it
will
come
as
a
surprise
that
it
can
be
easily
avoided
o
nothing
out
of
the
ordinary
here
very
average
i
imagine
this
beer
is
aimed
at
the
lagerobsessed
u
s
mainstream
market
but
considering
the
popularity
of
guinness
draught
this
beer
is
more
than
a
bit
redundant
overall
as
bland
boring
and
deficient
as
their
flagship
beer
but
without
the
treasured
history
of
the
standard
guinness
stout
poured
into
a
pint
glass
a
brownishblack
color
with
a
rocky
tan
head
of
decent
size
that
leaves
just
a
bit
of
patchy
lacing
on
the
glass
not
too
much
in
the
aroma
department
just
basic
scents
of
dark
malts
and
light
cocoa
dark
malts
in
the
taste
grainy
lightly
toasted
pretty
basic
decent
but
not
overly
flavorful
medium
mouthfeel
at
best
first
sip
actually
seemed
a
little
sandy
but
maybe
that
was
just
me
nothing
spectacular
especially
when
things
like
kostrizer
schwarzbier
exist
or
guinness
extra
stout
for
that
matter
fairly
drinkable
and
worth
a
try
but
thats
about
it
as
this
beer
warms
up
it
starts
to
taste
more
like
that
gross
smell
o
certainly
not
the
best
euro
dark
on
the
market
if
given
a
choice
between
your
average
adjunct
and
this
the
guiness
black
lager
might
win
but
not
by
a
lot
o
glad
i
got
to
try
this
but
this
was
a
very
bland
beer
an
easy
pounder
for
sure
but
thats
about
it
o
this
beer
really
disappointed
me
it
was
a
decent
black
lager
but
with
a
name
like
guinness
i
was
expecting
more
notes
guinness
as
a
lager
the
carbonation
gets
in
the
way
and
it
works
against
the
sour
flavor
profile
the
mouthfeel
is
not
heavy
a
drinkable
beer
but
not
an
excellent
one
o
wasnt
impressed
by
this
offering
i
think
guinness
should
have
gone
a
bit
bolder
with
this
one
easy
to
drink
ok
but
boring
beer
o
strange
offering
from
guinness
maybe
i
just
dont
get
it
just
not
very
euro
dark
lager
more
schwarzbier
and
not
a
very
good
one
this
could
be
a
fair
session
beer
but
there
are
other
brews
out
there
that
i
would
rather
drink
including
those
with
a
lower
abv
and
more
flavor
and
aroma
o
while
i
highly
enjoy
the
stout
and
i
am
glad
i
tried
it
i
wont
come
back
to
it
there
are
more
flavorful
well
rounded
black
lagers
on
the
market
edit
i
have
had
this
beer
many
more
times
since
my
review
and
it
has
improved
a
bit
in
my
opinion
i
think
the
initial
issue
was
that
i
was
drinking
it
too
cold
which
masked
the
taste
notes
now
i
find
it
to
be
malty
slightly
smokey
and
also
a
very
slight
hint
of
caramel
i
have
bumped
up
the
smell
and
taste
notes
by
a
full
point
each
and
the
same
for
the
overall
score
taste
is
some
black
patent
malt
and
tangy
minerals
not
really
very
pleasant
to
be
honest
not
sure
why
but
i
was
expecting
a
little
more
from
this
new
brew
its
watery
metallic
and
lacks
any
sort
of
character
i
would
like
to
see
at
least
a
little
sweetness
and
would
a
hint
of
hop
character
be
too
much
to
ask
im
not
even
going
to
comment
on
the
cold
brewed
nonsense
on
the
label
this
beer
is
a
total
farce
avoid
at
all
costs
guinness
should
be
thoroughly
ashamed
of
themselves
for
creating
this
monstrosity
its
ok
but
absolutely
no
reason
to
buy
this
over
sam
adams
black
lager
just
not
very
good
at
all
truly
i
would
expect
more
from
a
beer
coming
out
of
guinness
not
horribly
offensive
but
really
nothing
to
recommend
it
not
good
better
than
i
expected
easily
sessionable
alot
of
people
will
probably
hate
on
this
because
its
from
guinness
but
its
actually
not
too
bad
for
style
othis
is
decent
definitely
enjoyable
not
alot
of
alcohol
not
as
thick
as
it
appears
i
dont
mind
this
at
all
nothing
exceptional
but
overall
pretty
good
guinness
black
lager
is
a
black
beer
with
a
waxy
turbanado
colored
foam
that
has
pretty
nice
lacing
and
retention
the
aroma
is
very
muted
and
of
wet
cardboard
theres
a
touch
of
roast
and
maybe
spice
in
the
nose
its
mediumlight
bodied
fluffy
and
crisp
its
lightly
flavored
from
a
dark
malt
twang
at
the
first
taste
to
a
lightly
bitter
finish
of
coffee
and
medicine
this
stuff
just
goes
down
like
water
its
a
very
simple
refreshing
black
lager
overallnot
exactly
why
this
beer
is
being
produced
people
go
to
guinnes
to
drink
guinness
not
this
overall
eh
o
not
actively
bad
just
so
bland
and
inoffensive
i
cant
see
why
anyone
would
want
one
sam
adams
black
actually
has
flavor
as
does
session
black
try
those
instead
pours
a
deep
amber
to
black
color
with
a
light
tan
head
in
the
aroma
caramel
note
of
chocolate
and
still
lager
like
in
the
taste
light
chocolate
note
of
caramel
both
very
mellow
a
small
bite
and
medium
to
lighter
bodied
mouthfeel
with
a
small
roast
to
a
clean
aftertaste
lack
of
flavor
but
a
lager
form
of
guinness
for
sure
very
thin
and
watery
on
the
positive
side
you
could
drink
a
number
of
these
in
one
sitting
i
poured
from
a
bottle
into
a
nonic
dark
pour
big
white
head
nice
lacing
a
little
roast
on
the
nose
it
has
a
light
roasted
flavor
slight
astringent
notes
lingering
bitter
finish
the
beer
is
very
light
in
body
high
carbonation
easy
drinking
i
would
not
buy
this
again
why
make
this
beer
why
not
its
like
a
coors
light
with
a
guinness
after
taste
this
seems
to
be
the
result
of
guinness
responding
to
the
population
at
larges
idea
that
guiness
is
a
heavy
beer
and
for
those
who
do
like
it
that
sometimes
they
want
something
lighter
funny
in
dublin
a
met
a
girl
that
was
drinking
bud
heavy
cause
it
was
lighter
than
guinness
draught
that
said
im
regular
guinness
drinker
and
while
i
dont
love
this
i
wouldnt
mind
it
here
and
there
cold
brewed
oh
god
here
we
go
pours
dark
brown
with
light
tan
head
nose
on
the
really
light
side
with
faint
roasty
malts
cocoa
light
flavors
on
palate
of
roasty
malt
and
watery
coffee
watery
light
body
very
drinkable
but
not
much
to
savor
as
far
as
taste
and
nose
though
slight
lager
yeast
taste
think
harp
a
bit
of
sulfur
creamy
roasted
barley
chocolate
flavor
fairly
hefty
carbonation
and
light
body
just
a
tad
sweet
finish
sort
of
a
mix
of
the
extra
stout
and
harp
not
bad
definitely
the
most
thirst
quenching
dark
beer
ive
had
in
a
while
good
for
what
it
aims
to
be
i
wonder
if
it
will
last
i
might
buy
it
again
not
a
bad
beer
just
doesnt
do
much
for
me
could
use
more
depth
and
more
roasted
malt
character
i
was
looking
forward
to
trying
this
didnt
really
even
have
my
expectations
set
very
high
but
this
was
not
good
dont
think
im
going
to
finish
this
one
o
taken
as
a
schwarzbier
this
is
pretty
good
overall
not
horrible
but
at
the
same
time
not
the
best
type
of
brew
ive
had
from
guinness
dark
brown
colored
brew
with
an
aroma
of
roasted
malts
still
very
much
like
guinness
in
the
taste
clean
lager
yeast
with
a
touch
of
roasted
malt
reminds
me
of
a
dunkel
light
char
and
hop
notes
mouthfeel
is
medium
bodied
with
a
good
amount
of
carbonation
overall
a
lager
with
roasted
malts
somewhere
between
a
dunkel
schwarzbier
and
regular
guinness
o
a
nondiscript
offering
from
guinness
i
guess
its
for
people
who
want
to
be
hip
but
do
not
like
stouts
o
guinness
draught
was
the
first
beer
i
ever
had
back
in
2005
so
this
brewery
will
always
hold
a
special
place
in
my
heart
but
this
beer
is
not
good
i
feel
like
guinness
just
invented
the
black
light
lager
thats
really
what
it
is
just
reeks
of
corporatism
and
dumbing
down
for
the
masses
foreign
extra
stout
came
out
last
year
and
it
was
great
i
was
hoping
for
something
similar
here
didnt
happen
o
this
is
a
bland
beer
really
really
bland
its
not
offensive
like
bud
light
but
its
not
good
either
it
reminds
me
of
becks
with
much
the
same
hohum
taste
profile
and
watery
feel
warsteiner
dunkel
easily
bests
this
in
pretty
much
every
aspect
and
is
cheaper
than
most
guinness
offerings
avoid
notes
i
cant
figure
out
what
guinness
is
trying
to
do
with
this
beer
to
whom
is
this
supposed
to
appeal
my
best
guess
is
that
theyre
trying
to
capture
a
new
market
segment
by
making
a
beer
thats
more
americafriendly
while
still
staying
true
to
the
essence
of
their
brand
they
know
theres
a
lager
bias
here
and
they
imitate
american
macro
marketing
strategies
by
plastering
cold
brewed
and
other
such
nonsense
on
the
label
but
they
had
to
keep
it
dark
and
roasty
lest
they
stray
too
far
from
the
image
they
have
crafted
for
the
brand
the
problem
with
this
is
that
the
misconceptions
surrounding
light
beer
and
dark
beer
are
too
powerful
to
overcome
by
playing
the
lager
card
lager
has
become
synonymous
with
light
beer
over
here
the
average
joe
doesnt
care
that
its
a
lager
or
that
its
cold
brewed
because
its
still
a
dark
beer
the
fact
that
its
dark
is
what
alienates
people
so
who
will
drink
this
people
who
dont
mind
dark
beer
the
story
behind
it
sort
of
a
lesser
guinness
that
has
a
typical
carbonation
of
a
euro
lager
i
guess
i
just
dont
see
the
market
for
it
i
can
understand
why
fes
was
brought
to
the
states
this
one

finally
got
around
to
trying
this
due
to
the
fact
that
they
refuse
to
stock
the
fes
until
this
is
out
of
the
area
that
being
said
it
pours
a
nice
brown
color
with
garnet
fringes
and
a
nice
frothy
white
head
the
smell
is
a
bit
off
there
is
the
caramel
notes
and
rice
im
not
sure
how
the
smell
tapers
at
the
end
like
that
guinness
black
lager
is
probably
a
decent
introduction
for
the
noncraft
consumer
its
not
something
id
buy
for
myself
o
a
pretty
bland
beer
but
better
than
most
of
your
average
macros
cant
even
begin
to
hold
a
candle
to
some
of
unibroues
other
beers
but
its
acceptable
it
would
be
a
great
beer
for
a
session
drinker
but
not
something
id
like
to
sit
down
and
enjoy
one
or
two
of
better
than
most
macros
but
thats
really
not
saying
much
not
impressed
i
would
avoid
it
that
is
unless
youre
looking
to
drink
something
on
the
cheap
the
label
looks
cool
though
drinkability
its
a
lighter
tasting
lager
with
not
much
flavours
present
good
for
a
summer
beer
about
a
dollor
a
bottle
its
kind
of
like
a
higher
end
macro
ok
disappointing
given
the
brewery
what
we
have
here
folks
is
a
more
fizzy
version
of
good
ol
rickards
red
why
the
good
folks
at
unibroue
felt
they
needed
to
go
down

can
only
be
explained

and
the
like
a
pity
my
fatherinlaw
picked
up
a

pack
of
this
brew
on
a
recent
trip
quebec
i
read
the
reviews
of
this
beer
and
i
am
surprised
it
got
such
low
marks
its
certainly
not
the
best
ale
i
have
ever
tasted
but
in
this
reviewers
opinion
it
is
in

like

youd
never
be
able
to
tell
that
this
is
a
session
beer
weighing
in
at

a
first
gulp
reveals
a
pleasantly
carbonated
sweet
yet
roasted
light
bodied
smooth
beer
since
it
is
a
session
beer
it
is
very
easy
to
put
down
but
the
full
flavor
of
the
beer
makes
it
seem
more
practical
to
sip
slowly
and
enjoy
absolutely
fantastic
i
would
absolutely
make
this
a
mainstay
provided
i
could
get
it
on
tap
regularly
or
in
sixerstwelve
packs
the
flavor
is
bold
but
its
contituents
are
all
well
balanced
and
below
the
cloying
threshold
remarkably
similar
to
some
of
my
favorite
schwarzbiers
highly
recommended
the
beer
pours
a
dark
dark
brown
bordering
on
black
with
the
faintest
hint
of
ruddy
red
coloring
the
beer
pours
with
a
nice
lightly
khaki
color
head
that
sits
a
fingers
width
above
the
beer
with
plenty
of
tightly
packed
little
bubbles
that
form
a
very
smooth
top
to
the
head
the
lacing
on
the
sides
of
the
glass
is
thin
tightly
packed
and
moves
out
with
tendrils
along
the
glass
on
the
nose
the
beer
smells
lightly
roasty
with
a
nice
bready
tinge
and
some
slight
hay
notes
as
the
beer
is
swirled
in
the
glass
i
get
strong
waftings
of
milk
chocolate
with
the
slightest
hint
of
sea
salt
which
has
me
very
intrigued
the
smell
is
light
lagerclean
and
inviting
on
the
tongue
the
beer
tastes
roasty
but
clean
and
light
the
beer
begins
with
light
and
watery
milk
chocolate
before
pulling
in
watered
down
and
light
roasted
malts
that
suggest
very
light
coffee
and
is
really
quite
pleasant
the
finish
of
the
beer
is
where
it
really
shines
bringing
the
roast
to
a
full
flavor
and
hinting
at
chocolate
on
the
sides
of
the
taste
the
aftertaste
rings
with
light
roasted
chocolate
coffee
and
even
a
slight
hint
of
vanilla
on
the
mouth
this
beer
feels
light
and
clean
in
body
as
a
lager
should
and
is
honestly
a
little
watery
in
feel
though
paired
with
the
flavors
of
this
beer
that
is
certainly
not
a
bad
thing
after
the
beer
passes
the
mouth
is
left
clean
with
only
a
light
feeling
of
dryness
on
the
roof
of
the
mouth
overall
i
love
this
beer
notch
has
done
it
again
all
hail
the
session
king
it
is
smooth
light
and
extremely
drinkable
and
yet
still
is
packed
with
flavors
reminiscent
of
a
big
old
stout
this
beer
could
be
knocked
back
all
night
and
is
perfect
to
sip
in
front
of
a
fire
try
this
beer
taste
is

of

in
the
middle
and
then
cruises
through
the
close
with
a
sedate
bitterness

is
very
smooth

drinkability

a
given
factor
here
certainly
a
bold
flavor
profile
for
its
size
great
to
see
notch
broaden
their
portfolio
and
further
define
their
intent
of
brining
sessionable
beers
to
the
public
overallfor
the
style
this
is
one
of
the
best
i
have
had
i
would
make
this
more
the
a
3
5
3
75
if
not
grading
to
style
i
like
to
roastiness
of
this
one
not
my
favorite
from
notch
but
certainly
one
of
their
better
offerings
i
would
pick
this
one
up
again
impressive
flavors
for
such
a
small
beer
overall
no
hits
no
runs
but
no
errors
either
overall
pretty
good
they
def
got
plenty
of
dark
malt
flavor
and
kept
the
overall
beer
light
and
sessionable
nice
chocolate
caramel
coffee
and
roast
without
charred
bitterness
or
acidity
hint
of
bittering
hops
nice
hints
of
lager
appearance
as
well
this
drinks
like
a
schwarzbier
and
i
think
this
is
what
we
have
here
very
easy
to
drink
way
easy
on
the
wallet
odat

very

at

abv
great
mouthfeel
flavor
and
feel
mix
together
to
create
an
enjoyable
experience
per
sip
perhaps
i
should
give
their
other
beers
a
shot
this
is
a
very
drinkable
tasty
beer
i
could
easily
drink
2
or
3
at
one
sitting
great
work
chris
ill
reiterate
the
previous
reviewers
note
about
the
labels
happy
to
get
to
reuse
the
bottle
for
homebrews
a
touch
of
light
sweetness
alit
on
the
palate
with
subtle
cocoa
powder
and
dark
choco
action
following
had
a
smidge
of
roastyness
and
a
little
bitterness
following
the
choco
notes
lingered
well
like
a
mocha
milkshake
quite
nice

beer
is

and
dark
mildly
dry
finish
you
know
what
i
think
it
is
brett
o
i
thought
about
this
review
and
description
for
a
couple
of
hours
and
this
is
what
i
landed
on
i
think
this
beer
is
made
or
finished
with
brett
o
it
is
only
mildly
tart
but
not
funky
not
heavy
but
light
on
that
palate
i
did
not
enjoy
this
beer
as
much
as
i
hoped
i
think
death
and
taxes
is
a
superior
beer
by
far
and
im
basically
done
with
this
thanks
for
another
1
if
it
survives
the
spot
after
this
review
but
i
dont
think
id
have
it
again
pours
a
dark
brown
with
a
light
tan
head
and
a
bit
of
lacing
thin
collar
the
nose
brings
a
slight
amount
of
roast
as
well
as
some
mild
hops
and
a
slight
acidic
cherry
character
the
flavor
is
mostly
malty
with
a
bit
of
roast
and
some
noticeable
continental
hops
a
bit
of
cherry
there
as
well
light
body
and
slight
acidity
not
bad
at
all
but
not
quite
as
good
as
the
moonlight
dark
lagers
that
ive
come
across
interesting
flavor
and
profile
though
it
doesnt
quite
measure
up
now
of
course
a
lot
of
the
enjoyment
of
this
beer
is
the
experience
of
where
youre
drinking
it
with
the
accordion
player
or
oompah
loompah
duo
playing
tunes
the
servers
constantly
bringing
you
new
glasses
because
they
know
you
want
one
before
you
do
the
other
servers
cajoling
you
into
shots
of
cinnamon
schnapps
and
the
beer
cheese
appetizer
you
cant
help
but
love
this
beer
great
color
great
head
great
smell
great
feel
incredible
taste
what
a
great
beer
and
what
a
great
place
to
enjoy
it
i
did
not
find
it
a
tourist
trap
at
all
d
the
beer
goes
down
very
smoothly
and
is
very
sessionable
only
available
on
tap
at
the
2
places
mentioned
a
must
have
beer
for
the
novice
or
the
professional
its
a
dark
mahogany
brown
lager
with
a
very
rich
blackish
hue
head
is
voluminous
and
voluptuous
light
aromas
of
roast
malt
some
candy
sugar
dry
in
taste
smooth
easy
and
pairs
excellently
with
roast
pork
and
dumplings
well
done
all
around
did
not
even
know
prague
had
the
very
dark
lagers
until
i
stumbled
onto
this
beer
even
thought
it
was
a
stout
at
first
thats
how
similar
it
smelled
tasted
and
felt
would
have
to
say
this
beer
even
beats
out
many
stouts
at
what
they
do
best
a
complex
blend
of
darker
malt
flavors
i
can
detect
black
patent
grains
there
is
a
good
shot
of
hops
at
the
swallow
the
body
is
moderate
with
an
above
average
level
of
carbonation
frankly
this
is
a
delicious
treat
dark
in
color
and
has
a
light
full
flavor
taste
perfect
example
of
what
a
dark
lager
should
be
i
cant
locals
were
saying
this
beer
was
going
down
hill
how
much
better
can
it
be
this
beer
is
very
good
for
geting
people
into
dark
ale
just
a
shame
they
dont
export
it
i
picked
up
a
glass
and
another
for
a
mate
at
the
shop
dinkability
a
very
good
beer
not
in
the
style
euro
dark
lager
but
marzen
dark
as
stated
before
u
fleku
is
a
tourist
trap
you
must
visit
in
prague
avoid
the
awful
liquor
they
put
in
front
of
you
and
expect
you
to
pay
for
more
than
one
of
these
beers
is
too
much
finishes
smooth
and
clean
not
too
dry
or
sweet
not
that
youd
notice
though
since
the
waiter
will
have
given
you
another
before
youve
put
the
empty
glass
down
tourist
trap
prices
and
they
stick
a
little
glass
of
liqueur
in
front
of
you
and
expect
you
to
pay
for
it
which
is
a
little
irritating
there
are
waitpersons
lurking
about
with
big
trays
of
beer
ready
to
stick
another
mug
in
front
of
you
the
moment
you
finish
drinking
but
this
stuff
is
actually
a
little
unique
and
a
trip
to
prague
would
not
be
complete
without
drinking
a
mug
or
two
of
this
interesting
brew
as
someone
else
said
i
too
was
tired
of
drinking
all
the
pils
so
popular
in
czech
and
eastern
europe
so
when
i
walked
in
this
place
i
was
in
heaven
poured
a
dark
brown
color
with
a
nice
tan
head
nose
was
strong
of
roasted
malt
which
was
welcoming
also
had
notes
of
coffee
and
maybe
some
caramel
i
came
here
several
nights
in
a
row
and
drank
a
lot
of
this
the
drinkabilty
is
so
high
that
even
some
friends
who
dont
normally
like
dark
beer
were
quaffing
these
down
i
miss
this
beer
this
beer
was
good
so
for
me
that
i
forgot
to
eat
beautiful
unfiltered
dark
beer
with
very
complex
flavours
has
if
anything
improved
since
the
brewery
renovation
in
the
mid1980s
a
good
example
of
a
dunkles
maerzen
a
style
rare
outside
the
czech
republic
and
franconia
some
bitter
notes
in
the
aftertaste
light
liquorice
herbal
bitterness
not
bad
on
the
palate
its
generally
rich
darkmalty
and
consists
of
almost
all
the
elements
as
i
could
sense
from
its
aroma
with
a
tinge
of
blackfruits
tartness
and
fruity
hops
which
provide
very
good
balance
between
sourness
and
sweet
maltiness
but
perhaps
because
it
is
served
one
degree
too
cold
some
of
the
flavours
really
are
kept
at
bay
the
aftertaste
is
equally
affected
as
well
i
thinka
bit
short
and
light
with
a
little
bit
of
brownsugary
sticky
mouthfeel
left
on
the
sides
of
my
tongue
which
i
am
not
so
fond
of
overall
its
a
mediumbodied
mediumrich
flavoured
for
lagers
dark
beer
though
as
an
alegoer
id
expect
it
to
have
more
assertive
flavour
and
complexity
to
be
really
interesting
but
thats
just
my
biased
opinion
on
beers
in
general
and
i
do
think
it
can
be
a
much
more
complex
and
enjoyable
dark
lager
if
served
at
a
slightly
higher
temperature
this
stuff
looks
quite
good
deep
deep
color
almost
black
with
a
nice
tan
head
to
top
it
off
smells
good
lots
of
roasted
malts
and
a
bit
of
coffee
and
chocolate
thrown
in
as
well
the
taste
is
quite
good
as
well
nice
clean
and
crisp
as
a
lager
should
be
but
with
a
hefty
amount
of
flavor
lots
of
roasted
flavors
with
a
bit
of
hoppy
goodness
to
round
it
out
medium
carbonation
i
could
drink
this
stuff
all
night
if
it
werent
so
expensive
all
around
an
excellent
beer
and
definitely
a
must
try
while
youre
in
prague
draught
at
u
fleku
served
too
cold
very
dark
brown
nearly
black
colour
impenetrable
for
light
moderate
creamy
tan
head
lovely
aroma
of
leather
and
oak
dark
chocolate
and
liquorice
flavour
is
malty
and
moderately
roasty
notes
of
dark
chocolate
and
coffee
never
mind
the
inflated
prices
by
czech
standards
this
beer
is
a
must
at
least
once
and
the
liqueur
we
were
forced
to
buy
which
i
drank
after
the
beer
actually
tasted
nottoobad
the
atmosphere
was
a
little
silly
a
touristy
rendition
of
an
old
beer
hall
complete
with
oompah
tuba
and
accordion
music
and
the
food
was
standard
czech
fare
the
waitpersons
however
circulate
continuously
with
handfuls
of
mugs
containing
u
flecku
house
beer
it
pours
a
dark
brown
with
a
lightish
tinge
around
the
edges
and
a
light
tan
head
the
aroma
is
buttery
with
some
caramel
and
toffee
yet
it
is
clean
the
taste
has
some
butter
caramel
some
chocolate
and
is
slightly
sweet
with
a
mild
spiciness
there
is
low
hops
and
bitterness
but
it
is
smooth
clean
and
refreshing
the
best
dark
beer
in
cz
to
be
sure
really
a
great
beer
if
you
make
it
to
prague
make
sure
to
hit
u
fleku
just
for
the
beer
too
bad
the
growlers
at
the
pub
are
so
darn
expensive
the
best
beer
i
tasted
during
my
10day
trip
to
prague
and
also
the
best
dark
beer
i
ever
had
you
can
only
find
it
in
the
u
fleku
brewpub
a
black
coloured
beer
topped
by
a
large
tanned
head
aroma
is
malty
and
my
nose
also
cought
coffee
hints
taste
is
heaven
damn
this
beer
its
excellent
if
u
ever
find
your
self
in
pague
go
to
this
pub
just
to
taste
the
beer
it
will
worth
it
quite
drinkable
and
strong
mouthfeel
the
abv
is
ideal
to
spend
some
time
at
the
pub
drinking
the
u
fleku
house
beer
excellent
beer
a
classic
very
drinkable
dark
czech
lager
one
of
the
best
available
in
the
czech
republic
in
my
opinion
the
crack
and
inverted
glug
threatened
to
overflow
my
anderson
valley
canglass
with
its
dense
twoplus
fingers
of
dense
deeptan
head
with
good
retention
it
also
created
a
nice
pseudocascading
action
before
i
was
forced
to
back
off
color
was
a
deep
darkbrown
with
light
penetration
only
at
the
edges
nose
was
rich
with
a
smoky
dark
chocolate
smell
mouthfeel
was
a
little
on
the
thin
side
for
my
taste
but
oh
what
a
taste
i
described
an
earlier
beer
today
as
being
like
drinking
a
chocolate
milk
shake
but
this
was
even
closer
to
the
taste
than
that
one
very
chocolaty
without
being
overly
sweet
which
is
just
the
way
that
i
like
such
things
sweet
really
turns
me
off
finish
was
semisweet
and
the
chocolate
flavors
really
lingered
well
after
the
swallow
overall
this
is
a
nice
euro
dark
lager
whatever
that
means
reminds
me
of
a
less
impressive
lion
stout
still
enjoyable
would
recommend
if
you
are
facing
this
versus
any
mainstream
japanese
pilsneresque
beers
orion
kirin
asahi
etc
had
this
on
tap
at
the
yebisu
museum
in
ebisu
tokyo
poured
into
a
halfpint
glass
no
transparency
at
all
with
a
thick
beige
creamy
head
head
is
delicious
and
flavored
like
coffee
roasted
coffee
dominates
the
scent
as
well
the
taste
is
a
bit
watery
but
still
palatable
very
bitter
like
iced
coffee
beautiful
scattered
ring
lacing
around
the
glass
overall
a
wonderful
black
lager
especially
if
you
are
looking
for
a
coffeeinfluenced
taste
a
tasty
black
lager
o
again
if
it
comes
down
to
either
ordering
the
standard
asahi
kirin
sapporo
golden
lagers
or
this
one
im
choosing
this
all
day
long
definitely
not
one
that
would
be
my
beer
of
choice
back
in
the
states
but
i
applaud
the
effort
by
sapporo
to
market
a
darker
beer
now
if
only
demand
for
this
kind
of
product
would
increase
so
the
other
big
brewers
came
out
with
similar
products
o
overall
its
not
super
great
but
its
probably
the
most
tasty
refreshing
native
beer
in
japan
that
you
can
drink
all
day
at
the
park
or
just
walking
around
overall
fine
japanese
attempt
at
the
dark
euro
style
quite
drinkable
i
will
be
having
this
again
o
not
a
terrible
example
of
the
style
i
think
if
you
could
get
this
on
tap
and
it
was
just
a
little
bit
creamier
it
would
be
a
damn
fine
beer
as
it
is
its
pleasant
enough
d
easy
drinker
good
for
a
few
one
of
my
first
choices
when
i
find
it
available
while
traveling
in
japan
d
great
beer
and
recommeded
d
yeah
reach
for
the
others
when
you
are
in
a
japanese
supermarket
this
was
fine
when
it
was
the
only
one
on
the
market
but
now
there
are
so
many
better
ones
both
japanese
and
imported
md
the
carbonation
is
kept
at
a
healthy
level
i
e
soft
enough
and
not
at
all
spritzy
while
the
body
remains
mediumminus
to
go
well
with
the
refreshing
flavour
profile
i
find
this
beer
more
like
a
slightly
more
malty
heavier
schwarzbier
which
aided
by
sapporos
dryish
touch
and
a
delicate
hop
profile
is
rendered
even
more
quaffable
drinkability
i
would
have
this
again
and
would
recommend
this
to
those
who
like
to
try
a
roasted
malt
and
mildly
hoppy
black
beer
d
overall
a
very
average
dark
lager
admittedly
though
i
have
pulled
more
of
these
off
the
shelves
of
japanese
convenience
stores
than
any
other
beer
but
this
is
mostly
a
testemant
to
the
lack
of
dark
brew
options
here
overall
the
beer
was
quite
bland
imo
mouthfeel
drinkability
medium
body
mild
carbonation
on
the
whole
not
nearly
as
good
a
beer
as
the
hop
moderately
drinkable
enjoyed
at
the
ginza
lion
beerhall
nice
dark
brown
bordering
on
black
with
a
large
mocha
head
an
impressive
appearance
from
a
major
brewer
caramel
cocoa
and
coffee
in
the
aroma
smooth
roasty
taste
somewhat
like
kostritzer
with
the
emphasis
very
much
on
the
malts
creamy
mouthfeel
and
mild
carbonation
surprisingly
good
and
a
solid
quaffer
d
i
have
always
been
kind
of
a
fan
of
this
beer
but
it
is
really
smooth
on
tap
had
at
the
yebisu
beer
museums
bar
its
deep
black
with
brown
edges
and
a
tan
head
that
fades
looks
good
nose
is
roasted
caramel
malts
and
slight
hoppy
sweetness
taste
is
decent
malty
goodness
slightly
burnt
on
the
finish
and
an
underlying
sweetness
not
bad
average
mouthfeel
and
drinkability
this
beer
is
a
bit
off
the
beaten
path
compared
to
most
japanese
beers
if
youre
looking
for
a
native
beer
that
doesnt
lack
flavor
and
is
a
bit
more
malty
than
hoppy
this
beer
is
a
good
bet
its
one
of
the
best
beers
ive
been
able
to
find
in
japan
that
is
even
available
in
the
smaller
cities
its
far
better
on
tap
if
you
can
find
it
i
did
at
my
local
ikaku
restaurant
but
dont
hesitate
to
drink
it
straight
from
the
can
or
bottle
thumbs
up
from
this
gaijin
that
there
could
be
more
to
it
i
highly
recommend
this
if
youre
in
japan
it
beats
the
kirin
and
other
sapporo
products
ive
tried
drinkability
this
is
my
goto
beer
in
japan
as
its
generally
the
most
flavorful
option
at
most
stores
and
it
doesnt
run
quite
as
expensive
as
japanese
craft
brews
definitely
recommended
in
this
land
of
rice
lagers
and
happoshu
not
bad
for
a
macro
not
bad
at
all
had
a
couple
of
these
at
the
da
vinci
bar
in
the
ana
hotel
in
akasaka
quite
pleasant
roasty
aromas
and
a
good
roasted
caramel
flavour
although
fairly
weak
in
body
carbonation
was
a
bit
higher
than
id
like
as
well
but
still
pretty
drinkable
abv
stated
on
can
as
5
this
is
a
nice
wellbalanced
beer
no
surprise
its
pale
brother
yebisu
was
my
favorite
macro
for
a
long
time
overall
taste
and
mouthfeel
average
not
bad
above
average
for
japanese
massproduced
lagers
worth
a
try
its
a
nice
to
try
beer
seems
like
the
japanese
has
this
for
a
session
beer
they
can
enjoy
an
enjoyable
easy
drinking
beer
a
quickly
disappearing
cokelike
head
brownish
with
big
bubbles
the
color
is
dark
purple
and
the
only
thin
i
could
get
from
the
smell
was
some
winy
notes
the
taste
is
interesting
smoked
malts
winy
grape
notes
cherry
and
dark
chocolate
floury
on
the
tongue
the
carbonation
is
citric
and
iodated
the
mouthfeel
is
a
bit
rough
from
the
chocolate
like
bitterness
but
shows
some
creamyness
too
a
nice
beer
i
enjoy
drinking
this
beer
despite
its
inflated
price
it
lacks
the
taste
that
asahis
black
beer
pulls
off
but
its
great
presentation
and
feels
good
in
the
mouth
the
smells
a
little
watery
with
only
a
slight
maltiness
the
very
dark
red
color
and
fleeting
head
remind
me
of
a
nice
pennsylvania
dutch
birch
beer
not
beer
theres
a
pretty
high
carbonation
which
unfortunately
doesnt
give
way
to
too
much
else
theres
some
type
of
earthy
slightly
bitter
unrefined
beer
taste
like
peanut
shells
or
something
maybe
a
little
dark
cherry
taste
in
there
as
well
the
was
an
extraordinarily
average
beer
tan
rapidly
disappearing
head
medium
to
light
lacing
the
faintest
aroma
of
coffee
and
nuts
this
is
very
similar
to
the
original
yebisu
only
with
the
ever
distant
coffee
and
hazelnut
flavor
in
the
background
i
would
not
bother
to
drink
this
again
but
then
again
i
am
not
a
big
fan
of
the
style
as
of
2014
it
is
an
award
winning
brew
that
has
a
solid
unique
flavor
not
too
bad
of
a
beer
not
a
bad
goto
beer
dark
malt
pils
not
exceptionally
malty
nor
exceptionally
hoppy
if
you
like
dark
lagers
this
is
for
you
to
add
to
the
beer
you
had
i
will
drink
it
again
this
is
very
interesting
just
because
of
how
unique
it
is
sbcs
other
yearround
beers
are
very
mediocre
but
i
really
enjoyed
the
pilsnoir
since
it
stood
out
among
their
other
offerings
o
probably
a
good
dead
of
summer
refresher
pils
noir
pours
a
dark
copper
color
with
a
small
nonlacing
head
there
is
a
rich
malty
aroma
with
a
nice
spice
note
the
taste
has
nice
malty
backbone
with
a
good
spice
note
nice
crisp
sweet
malt
finish
nice
flavors
but
overall
the
body
is
a
bit
watery
overall
its
a
nice
lighter
beer
good
spice
notes
nice
flavors
my
pour
netted
me
a
finger
of
fizzy
deeptan
head
that
quickly
fell
away
to
wisps
color
was
a

deepruby
srm

with
nequality
clarity
when
held
up
to
the
dying
light
of
the
day
nose
had
a
very
caramellike
sweetness
perhaps
from
the
decoction
caramel
and
milk
chocolate
actually
mouthfeel
was
prickly
as
though
the
carbonation
was
very
tight
the
taste
was
smoky
chocolaty
a
little
nutty
and
somewhat
caramel
man
this
was
a
liquid
candy
bar
of
some
stripe
although
i
could
not
put
my
finger
on
it
finish
was
a
bit
too
sweet
for
my
taste
but
there
was
nothing
intrinsically
wrong
with
it
you
might
be
disappointed
if
you
had
your
heart
set
on
a
schwartzbier
but
otherwise
this
was
a
decent
bier
that
said
this
offering
did
pair
well
with
my
tilapia
dinner
bottom
line
decent
brew
ojust
a
step
below
excellent
still
pretty
damn
good
is
pretty
damn
good
id
give
it
two
thumbs
up
especially
at
its
reasonable
price
still
finding
it
hard
to
believe
that
i
preferred
the
bottle
to
the
draught
though
inoffensive
is
the
best
i
can
say
this
is
a
medium
bodied
brew
with
a
modest
amount
of
carbonation
it
is
clean
crisp
and
one
of
the
more
enjoyable
schwarzbiers
i
have
had
in
a
long
time
i
wish
it
would
have
included
just
a
bit
of
roast
however
its
drinkability
and
clean
profile
make
up
for
that
it
is
to
be
commended
that
this
the
first
schwarzbier
i
have
had
in
a
long
time
that
did
not
have
a
strange
mineral
aspect
to
the
finish
and
little
to
no
diacetyl
well
done
would
drink
again
i
would
drink
this
again
good
brew
central
pa
the
beer
pours
a
dark
brownblack
color
with
a
thick
frothy
offwhite
head
that
slowly
fades
to
lacing
the
aroma
is
decent
it
has
a
light
pale
malt
scent
along
with
a
touch
of
black
malt
earthiness
its
bone
dry
with
a
slight
bitterness
the
taste
is
decent
as
well
it
has
a
smooth
earthy
black
malt
flavor
its
faint
but
adds
a
solid
bitterness
and
excellent
color
the
mouthfeel
is
fine
it
is
a
medium
bodied
beer
with
adequate
carbonation
this
is
a
pretty
good
beer
but
nothing
too
interesting
nonetheless
id
throw
a
few
of
these
in
the
fridge
any
day
o
interesting
and
different
i
dont
beleive
i
have
ever
had
a
schwarzbier
do
i
cant
rate
it
accurately
wow
what
a
wonderful
beer
took
me
by
surprise
dark
in
color
and
smooth
in
taste
a
great
beer
a
beer
you
can
drink
and
drink
puts
a
a
smile
om
your
face
a
good
drink
beer
all
susquehanna
beers
are
worth
drinking
all
night
enjoy
theese
beers
thank
you
sbc
your
worth
drinking
d
first
of
all
this
should
be
labeled
on
this
website
as
a
schwarz
not
simply
as
a
german
pils
baring
the
mislabeling
on
ba
this
is
a
pretty
solid
schwarz
plenty
of
bitter
dark
malt
while
not
being
fruity
lagerlike
throughout
wouldnt
hate
for
a
touch
more
on
the
hop
aroma
side
of
things
maybe
some
aroma
has
worn
off
due
to
time
since
bottling
but
without
any
date
coding
impossible
to
tell
o
not
bad
a
unique
brew
if
anything
a
gimmick
if
you
will
dont
get
me
wrong
its
a
good
beer
but
i
wouldve
hoped
a
little
more
character
could
be
in
a
unique
beer
such
as
this
regardless
sbc
still
has
yet
to
disappoint
me
so
keep
it
up
guys
similar
to
a
schwarzbier
in
flavor
the
pilsner
qualities
are
completely
lost
i
cant
say
that
im
crazy
about
this
one
i
like
this
beer
it
was
good
i
hope
to
try
more
of
thier
products
as
they
come
my
way
once
again
thank
you
sbc
sweet
and
more
fullbodied
than
what
you
find
in
this
part
of
the
world
i
think
that
it
had
a
nice
fruity
complexity
and
was
well
done
when
in
thailand
and
all
you
can
find
is
light
lagers
this
beer
is
like
carmel
gold
this
is
a
big
miss
in
just
about
every
way
drinkable
but
thats
it
no
real
taste
to
it
this
is
one
amazing
beer
i
was
in
a
discount
grocery
store
and
stumbled
upon
this
selling
for
just
2
99
for
a
6
pack
seriously
2
99
i
have
tried
a
few
discounted
beers
and
so
far
they
rank
up
there
with
the
best
micro
brews
i
have
had
smooth
and
zesty
this
is
one
of
them
and
even
my
girlfriend
who
is
not
too
huge
a
beer
fan
agrees
amazing
is
all
i
can
say
it
honestly
is
one
of
the
best
tasting
micro
brews
i
have
ever
had
that
with
the
2
99
price
unbelievable
like
seriously
unbelievable
this
is
a
beer
that
you
can
drink
1
after
another
or
drink
with
a
good
steak
or
burger
it
is
cheaper
than
most
micro
brews
by
3x
at
least
at
this
store
here
in
cali
and
tastes
as
good
or
better
if
you
like
dark
beers
you
gotta
get
your
lips
on
these
i
am
all
for
american
brews
but
this
imported
brew
blows
american
brews
out
of
the
water
as
i
was
drinking
it
i
was
thinking
about
the
cost
to
make
it
bottle
it
import
it
on
boats
from
thousands
of
miles
away
and
how
it
still
is
so
cheap
and
so
damn
good
tasting
i
am
blown
away
the
only
reason
i
didnt
give
it
a
5
is
because
it
is
the
first
time
i
have
had
it
beerlao
dark
does
not
compare
to
the
dark
lagers
of
continental
europe
but
its
one
of
the
more
approachable
flavourful
and
all
around
better
beers
ive
tried
from
southeast
asia
having
never
traveled
there
i
imagine
this
may
be
as
good
as
it
gets
in
that
part
of
the
world
a
reasonable
assumption
given
the
awful
exports
ive
been
subjected
to
decent
dark
lager
its
body
is
a
bit
too
thin
and
boozy
but
its
hoppy
and
caramel
profile
were
a
positive
surprise
overall
it
became
an
interesting
beer
onot
bad
as
far
as
asian
lagers
go
it
goes
well
with
spicy
food
the
flavor
has
a
mild
cereal
and
bready
malt
flavor
which
is
mildly
sweet
essence
with
toastiness
of
lightly
roasted
malt
and
gentle
yeast
which
has
a
tangy
flavor
but
not
over
the
top
just
enough
to
notice
as
it
finishes
with
a
slight
crisp
branlike
taste
with
a
mix
of
sweetness
and
earthy
malt
flavors
with
slight
residual
sweetness
as
it
finishes
with
a
slight
dark
brown
sugar
accent
overall
a
pretty
decent
dark
lager
not
the
best
but
has
a
nice
drinkability
and
was
better
than
expected
the
appearance
is
dark
mahogany
with
crimson
highlights
big
soapy
white
head
that
hangs
around
for
a
long
time
the
aroma
is
pretty
faint
some
lager
yeast
dark
fruits
brown
bread
prickly
carbonation
too
prickly
actually
with
some
hop
bitterness
in
the
back
a
tad
sweet
light
to
medium
in
body
ok
m
not
too
heavy
sweet
and
boozy
while
still
managing
to
be
drinkable
and
refreshing
overall
slightly
above
average
wouldnt
purchase
again
but
i
wouldnt
refuse
it
if
someone
offered
it
to
me
o
this
is
a
surprising
easy
to
drink
euro
dark
lager
with
a
slightly
lighter
body
which
makes
it
good
for
drinking
in
warm
weather
pairs
well
with
intensely
flavorful
foods
od
an
ok
dark
lager
definitely
a
step
up
from
the
run
of
the
mill
yellow
lagers
around
the
country
i
could
have
a
few
of
these
but
it
really
doesnt
stand
out
too
much
style
wise
decent
but
off
style
and
far
too
sweet
for
our
first
experience
with
beerlao
euro
dark
lager
i
am
very
impressed
i
will
be
buying
more
of
this
in
the
near
future
i
bet
this
would
be
a
great
beer
to
pair
with
some
brown
rice
sushi
or
with
an
asian
chicken
dish
o
interesting
and
a
little
better
than
expected
this
is
a
pretty
simple
onedimensional
beer
if
this
were
american
itd
be
a
poorly
put
together
amber
lager
as
a
european
lager
i
give
it
slightly
more
credit
nonetheless
its
disappointing
and
forgettable
quite
disappointed
with
this
beer
like
the
other
beer
lao
it
is
just
a
sweet
and
malty
bland
beer
with
some
caramel
and
just
a
hint
of
spices
quite
sweet
and
sugary
very
little
bitterness
has
some
of
that
old
lager
flavor
but
for
the
most
part
it
goes
down
fairly
easy
its
still
drinkable
but
far
from
a
great
beer
overall
a
decent
and
drinkable
dark
lager
im
going
to
award
some
bonus
points
here
for
the
light
smokiness
which
really
is
a
treat
here
again
if
not
tostyle
this
is
a
decent
beer
but
nothing
exceptional
pours
a
transparent
ruddy
color
with
a
generous
creamcolored
head
aroma
is
mildly
malty
and
nondescript
flavor
profile
is
malty
dark
malt
and
onedimensional
but
not
unpleasant
an
easytodrink
beer
with
enough
flavor
to
keep
you
interested
but
nothing
to
write
home
about
i
used
to
buy
this
all
the
time
at
a
thai
restaurant
on
9th
avenue
in
hells
kitchen
new
york
city
matched
my
tom
yum
fried
rice
amazingly
well
it
is
one
of
the
darkest
lagers
ive
seen
from
southeast
asia
only
comparable
to
abc
stout
from
singapore
although
this
beer
is
much
better
the
smell
is
enjoyable
with
lots
of
nutty
notes
even
more
than
most
guinness
sold
abroad
but
the
highest
note
for
this
beer
as
it
should
be
for
any
is
the
taste
amazingly
smooth
yet
thick
in
the
way
a
good
dark
lager
should
be
this
brew
fulfills
all
of
my
expectations
of
what
i
want
when
i
order
a
dark
beer
hard
to
find
but
if
you
can
get
a
bottle
and
enjoy
it
a
great
representation
for
the
country
of
laos
d
drinkable
yes
desirable
hardly
cool
to
sample
a
brew
from
laos
but
otherwise
not
really
worth
seeking
pours
a
super
dark
brown
w
a
one
finger
cocoa
head
impossible
to
see
through
and
almost
zero
lacing
on
my
snifter
glass
nose
is
that
of
caramel
malt
nuttiness
and
diapers
not
a
big
fan
of
that
last
smell
fortunately
i
dont
get
the
diaper
in
the
taste
just
caramel
malt
and
nuttiness
maybe
a
hint
of
chocolate
as
well
mouthfeel
is
probably
the
strongest
part
of
this
beer
its
full
bodied
malty
actually
pretty
good
overall
i
would
not
seek
this
beer
out
again
my
first
brew
from
laos
though
so
i
wanted
to
check
it
out
cheers
surprisingly
beerlao
has
created
a
pretty
decent
beer
here
this
is
my
first
laotian
beer
and
i
have
to
admit
i
was
honestly
surprised
the
beer
has
a
nice
nutmeg
brown
color
and
a
somewhat
spicy
aroma
the
beer
pours
smoothly
and
goes
down
smoothly
it
tastes
very
clean
and
goes
down
smoothly
the
beer
has
a
decent
amount
of
alcohol
in
it
but
does
not
have
the
overly
sweet
taste
usually
asociated
with
higher
alcohol
content
beers
a
worthy
effort
i
look
forward
to
finding
more
laotian
beers
in
the
future
overall
i
fully
expected
a
lot
less
flavor
than
this
nice
beer
45
o
overall
this
is
a
surprisingly
good
beer
definately
a
hidden
gem
this
is
a
tasty
beer
from
a
country
i
quite
honestly
wasnt
expecting
something
good
from
would
definately
purchase
this
again
o
i
found
this
beer
to
be
surprisingly
good
i
would
definitely
have
it
again
the
beer
pours
a
translucent
dark
brown
color
with
a
thick
frothy
tan
head
that
slowly
fades
to
lacing
the
aroma
is
average
it
has
a
solid
pilsner
and
caramel
malt
scent
thats
sweet
to
the
nose
but
also
dry
in
the
finish
theres
also
a
metallic
character
as
well
that
takes
away
from
the
aroma
the
taste
is
decent
it
has
a
smooth
caramel
malt
flavor
laid
over
a
base
of
pilsner
malts
it
goes
down
easy
with
a
velvety
sweetness
and
mouthfeel
and
finishes
dry
with
a
slight
metallic
edge
the
mouthfeel
is
fine
it
is
a
mediumfull
bodied
beer
with
good
carbonation
this
is
a
pretty
solid
dark
lager
its
an
easy
drinker
with
good
malt
character
really
good
drinkable
not
too
light
yet
not
too
overburden
load
i
would
definitely
pick
this
one
up
again
summary
i
enjoy
this
one
and
if
i
have
a
chance
to
travel
to
laos
i
can
say
that
ill
have
another
dark
lager
there
d
i
wouldnt
go
back
for
another
i
enjoyed
this
beer
a
lot
if
for
no
other
reason
than
that
i
can
cross
off
another
southeastern
asian
country
off
my
to
drink
list
overall
about
what
youd
expect
from
the
style
give
it
a
shot

youre

but
the
flavor
doesnt
reflect
that
too
much
other
than
a
slightly
toasted
tone
a
good
pick
to
change
things
up
overall
it
was
a
solid
enjoyable
beer
and
boasted
one
of
the
higher
abvs
youre
going
to
find
in
an
asian
beer
available
in
shanghai
d
okay
i
just
happened
upon
a
free
single
of
this
and
figured
why
not
its
not
an
awesome
beer
but
its
solid
i
probably
wont
pick
it
up
again
though
d
its
quite
drinkable
for
a
dark
beer
and
is
particularly
suited
for
drinking
during
the
summer
months
or
southeast
asian
climate
d
decent
and
i
can
see
it
complementing
laotian
food
well
by
providing
respite
from
the
strong
flavors
apparently
the
easiest
beer
from
southeast
asia
for
me
to
acquire
out
here
in
nova
huh
anyway
it
pours
a
clear
dark
tawny
with
about
half
a
finger
of
light
ecru
minifoam
on
top
the
nose
is
dark
wheat
cinnamon
and
nutmeg
a
helluva
lot
better
than
i
was
expecting
i
blame
thailand
and
nam
for
this
the
taste
doesnt
deviate
too
far
with
notes
of
dark
malts
wheat
and
a
slight
underlying
sweetness
honestly
this
may
be
the
besttasting
euro
dark
ive
had
in
a
long
goddamn
time
whoda
thunk
it
the
body
is
light
with
a
lightly
moderate
carbonation
and
a
rather
watery
feel
not
an
optimal
feel
but
a
surprisingly
highly
drinkable
brew
nonetheless
right
on
laos
pours
a
three
finger
cream
head
that
fades
quickly
to
a
thin
layer
leaving
some
lace
nice
crystal
clear
amber
color
mystery
bits
in
bottom
of
glass
that
may
or
may
not
be
yeast
light
carbonation
and
medium
bodied
faint
malty
nose
flavor
reminds
me
of
honey
cough
syrup
far
better
than
their
lager

some

in

after
warming
quite
a
good
beer
the
body
on
this
beer
is
a
bit
light
for
the
style
it
initially
feels
medium
but
really
is
a
bit
too
watery
on
the
way
down
flavor
has
an
earthiness
to
it
and
exhibits
a
decent
malty
character
weakness
is
the
lack
of
any
balanced
sweetness
makes
you
wonder
how
water
from
different
regions
affects
the
beer
in
this
case
its
a
negative
to
me
overall
a
fairly
drinkable
beer
and
better
than
any
other
asian
beer
ive
had
with
exponentially
more
body
and
flavors
than
the
other
beers
made
in
this
region
for
now
this
is
the
go
to
beer
in
se
asia
other
than
any
imports
you
can
find
which
are
scarce
but
increasingly
available
in
some
places
overall
it
is
pretty
easy
drinking
wherever
you
may
enjoy
it
good
drinkability
compared
to
most
others
ive
tried
in
this
style
over
the
past
this
one
stands
out
dark
brown
with
a
hint
of
orange
under
nary
a
finger
of
beige
head
smells
of
skunkiness
and
caramel
malts
theres
a
metallic
thing
going
on
in
the
taste
as
well
as
a
sour
overtone
this
is
really
quite
bad
its
thin
and
drinkable
if
you
can
overcome
the
flavor
not
for
me
can
chen
aroma
is
fruity
and
a
bit
fruitsweet
with
a
malty
undertone
pours
a
slightly
hazy
cinnamon
brown
with
a
decent
creamcolored
head
flavor
is
crisp
malty
slightly
yeasty
and
just
a
little
fruity
with
just
a
tiny
bit
of
sweetness
texture
is
rather
smooth
and
fizzy
rather
typical
worth
a
try
this
would
make
for
a
respectable
drinker
in
the
hotter
weather
not
the
greatest
not
the
worst
ever
drank
drinkability
is
alright
its
hot
humid
and
this
dark
beer
lao
is
easy
to
drink
and
a
bit
more
tasty
than
other
brew
surprisingly
white
colored
head
given
the
deeper
brown
to
amber
hued
liquid
you
get
about
a
half
finger
with
average
retention
good
tenacity
in
what
lacing
there
is
fully
transparent
direct
and
simple
nose
based
in
caramelized
brown
sugar
cola
bean
rice
and
processed
flour
some
okra
or
greens
notes
over
time
a
strong
earthiness
comes
out
not
much
by
way
of
fruit
or
citrus
for
what
its
worth
clean
dissolve
light
to
mediumbodied
the
carbonation
has
a
tough
edge
to
it
adds
some
turbulence
not
that
sweet
however
the
caramel
honey
brown
sugar
the
most
prominent
part
by
default
cant
shake
that
vegetal
edge
maybe
just
maybe
some
orange
peel
more
of
the
earthy
sort
of
minerally
stuff
you
can
drink
it
without
pain
nor
suffering
but
once
the
glass
is
empty
you
hardly
remember
it
skip
this
one
even
if
you
are
in
the
area
the
taste
is
caramel
and
a
bit
nutty
the
overly
processed
taste
to
the
beer
and
what
appears
to
be
a
cheaply
made
beer
is
enough
for
me
this
isnt
good
enough
to
suffer
through
perhaps
with
a
fresher
beerlao
i
would
think
differently
but
i
only
have
the
one
to
rate
and
it
isnt
good
overall
i
dig
beer
lao
the
light
is
better
than
the
dark
in
my
opinion
but
this
is
something
i
wouldnt
mink
having
every
once
in
a
while
yeah
anyways
this
ones
just
kinda
there
for
me
has
that
kind
of
skunky
smell
that
all
important
green
bottles
or
anything
from
the
south
pacific
has
kind
of
a
syrupy
mouthfeel
with
a
sweet
no
roast
flavor
this
is
pretty
much
how
dark
beers
from
warm
climate
breweries
always
taste
yeah
well
probably
shelve
this
at
the
store
cause
it
will
attract
about
a
months
worth
of
curiosity
purchases
but
i
doubt
this
will
hang
with
other
beers
from
its
region
like
singha
or
tiger
beerlao
dark
is
a
very
clear
brown
lager
with
a
fluffy
off
white
head
that
leaves
nice
lacing
it
has
a
faint
aroma
of
grain
and
vegetables
with
a
hint
of
sweet
and
a
hint
of
sour
it
has
a
smooth
medium
body
with
a
watery
finish
it
tastes
slightly
sweet
like
dark
malt
extract
with
no
roastiness
really
theres
a
touch
of
chocolate
and
caramel
and
maybe
squash
or
yams
its
relatively
inoffensive
finish
then
finishes
with
long
pleasant
malt
and
hops
end
palate
and
finish
is
strength
of
this
beer
not
what
i
would
call
drink
friendly
overall
this
is
much
better
than
the
standard
beerlao
and
i
guess
if
i
was
stranded
there
id
go
for
this
drinkability
especially
for
southeast
asia
this
is
one
of
the
more
drinkable
options
being
a
dark
beer
which
in
itself
distinguishes
it
from
other
options
it
displays
a
few
dunkel
characteristics
as
well
making
it
a
good
change
of
pace
from
the
singha
variety
beers
dark
opaque
and
typically
dunkel
in
apppearance
i
love
the
malty
aromas
with
roasted
coffee
bean
and
toffee
that
isnt
too
overbearing
its
just
right
the
taste
is
a
liitle
bit
of
a
letdown
unfortunately
i
mean
again
it
tastes
like
a
usual
dunkel
beer
from
germany
but
i
feel
that
it
is
lacking
character
considering
ive
never
had
a
beer
from
laos
before
and
was
hoping
for
some
ingenuity
i
dont
consider
rice
additives
ingenuity
by
the
way
the
finish
has
enough
bitters
to
keep
me
reaching
for
my
glass
though
the
length
is
slightly
short
drinkability
delightfully
tolerable
and
here
i
was
worried
a
tolerable
beer
from
laos
would
be
as
incredibly
rare
a
find
as
the
laotian
rock
rat
from
a
twelve
ounce
bottle
pours
a
clear
brownish
red
below
average
carbonation
and
lacing
smells
of
mild
malts
and
mild
hops
maybe
some
rice
or
other
adjuncts
first
sip
is
surprisingly
lighter
than
expected
some
mild
bitterness
weak
malt
backbone
on
a
whole
not
very
good
but
better
than
their
lager
this
is
a
dark
beer
that
goes
down
easy
in
hot
weather
by
the
mekong
river
i
did
this
review
after
finishing
a
delicious
beerfest
here
in
st
louis
so
it
faired
poorly
compared
to
what
id
been
drinking
the
truth
is
its
a
damn
good
brew
for
the
part
of
the
world
its
from
youre
lucky
to
find
any
other
commercially
produced
beer
in
asia
thats
not
just
headacheinducing
formaldahydebrewed
piss
plus
its
cheap

for

49
this
beer
is
surprisingly
decent
pours
dark
chestnut
with
an
okay
head
that
fades
to
a
swirly
cap
smells
grainy
and
malty
with
some
notes
of
cocoa
and
cream
as
well
as
a
touch
of
lager
yeast
the
taste
is
similar
with
nice
cocoa
notes
over
a
grainy
malty
base
that
lacks
the
grainy
sourness
you
sometimes
find
in
these
euro
lagers
relatively
clean
in
the
mouth
with
a
pleasantly
creamy
finish
not
bad
at
all
decent
beer
which
i
bought
in
a
supermarket
when
i
was
in
the
south
of
france
couple
months
ago
light
ambercolor
and
decent
carbo
not
a
spectacular
beer
but
drinkable
pours
clear
light
brown
and
looks
beautiful
thin
evanescent
head
not
much
going
on
in
terms
of
smell
just
bland
nutty
notes
the
mouthfeel
is
light
almost
watery
with
a
fair
amount
of
carbonation
tastes
nutty
with
some
floral
and
fruity
notes
and
some
acidity
not
really
bad
but
not
to
be
missed
a
good
refreshing
brew
to
be
enjoyed
well
chilled
sessionable
o
overall
a
pretty
average
beer
not
strong
in
any
of
the
flavors
and
not
a
ton
going
on
though
not
offensive
or
bad
at
all
easy
to
drink
but
better
beers
to
find
in
france
brasserie
pietra
is
a
french
brewery
on
the
isle
of
corsica
in
the
mediterranean
sea
corsica
is
known
for
its
production
of
chestnuts
and
the
beer
is
brewed
with
chestnut
flour
not
surprisingly
the
clear
ambercolored
beer
actually
tastes
of
chestnuts
its
balanced
fluctuating
between
a
sweet
maltiness
and
a
drying
bitterness
that
may
be
in
part
due
to
the
chestnuts
themselves
the
body
is
medium
with
a
dextrinous
edge
and
a
median
carbonation
at
6
0
alcohol
by
volume
its
strong
but
not
overly
so
and
the
alcohol
is
wellcloaked
probably
best
served
wellchilled
to
begin
with
its
a
unique
and
interesting
beer
thats
well
worth
trying
clearish
mahogany
pour
into
a

a
14
cap
of

foam
on
top
that
sank
to
a
ringlet
leaving
dots
of
lacing
behind
caramel
malts
on
the
nose
wood
and
nutshells
had
a
nutty
taste
somewhat
reminiscent
of
a
nut
brown
ale
but
nothing
really
distinctively
chestnut
about
it
caramel
malt
sweetness
mild
leafy
hops
and
a
bit
of
earth
and
cardboard
there
was
nothing
amazing
going
on
here
but
i
still
quite
enjoyed
this
one
and
these
days
for
me
to
enjoy
a
lager
is
saying
a
lot
lightmedium
body
smooth
clean
basic
easily
drinkable
not
bad
o
i
couldnt
make
it
through
the
glass
and
the
plastic
bandaid
flavor
sticks
in
my
mouth
even
after
im
finished
i
couldnt
really
detect
any
other
flavors
hiding
out
in
there
overall
interesting
enough
glad
i
got
the
oppurtunity
to
try
has
a
unique
flavor
profile
yet
is
approachable
to
the
average
consumer
decent
drinking
brew
o
nicely
drinkable
and
decently
refreshing
an
easy
simple
beer
but
with
a
bit
of
a
distinct
character
enjoyable
o
well
considering
thats
a
french
beer
we
can
say
that
its
not
that
bad
overall
i
think
this
a
nice
beer
that
would
have
been
decent
without
the
chestnuts
but
their
addition
does
bring
a
nice
earthiness
to
the
mixture
that
works
quite
well
dr
she
drinks
easy
helped
by
the
low
abv
the
quality
is
good
for
an
amber
i
trust
the
brewers
definition
of
style
over
beeradvocates
im
glad
they
didnt
overcaramelize
the
malt
that
flavour
wouldnt
suit
the
beer
give
her
a
spin
the
price
is
fair
by
french
standards
though
i
got
her
in
a
supermarket
pours
a
dark
golden
yellow
color
with
a
good
amount
of
head
that
doesnt
last
long
mostly
malt
maybe
a
bit
of
a
floral
aroma
in
the
smell
taste
was
also
very
malty
better
than
your
typical
lager
but
still
kind
of
average
decent
carbonation
and
overall
was
an
okay
beer
overall
while
i
have
a
hard
time
enjoying
lagers
much
any
more
this
one
really
did
much
better
by
me
than
most
if
youre
staring
at
a
menu
full
of
coors
and
buds
and
this
one
happens
to
be
on
there
go
for
it
overall
the
beers
taste
seemed
to
improve
as
it
got
warmer
but
i
still
wasnt
really
a
big
fan
there
was
just
something
about
the
taste
that
i
really
didnt
enjoy
a
beer
brewed
with
chestnut
flour
pours
a
2
offwhite
head
which
lasts
a
reasonable
time
body
is
hazy
amber
almost
apricot
in
hue
taste
and
smell
are
both
fairly
standard
lager
which
surprised
me
considering
the
special
addition
ingredient
i
would
say
its
richer
than
average
with
a
medium
weight
body
and
i
think
thats
where
the
chestnuts
contributed
so
just
slightly
better
than
bmc
beers
pours
clear
light
amber
body
with
fleeting
white
head
the
nose
is
chestnut
dried
apple
slices
and
grassy
hops
in
contrary
to
the
aroma
i
cant
get
any
chestnut
flavor
out
of
this
the
taste
is
caramel
malt
and
grassy
hops
with
bitter
finish
light
bodied
nothing
memorable
d
i
would
buy
again
of
this
beer
the
chestnut
makes
it
a
very
different
beer
of
what
we
are
used
to
im
not
sure
its
a
dark
lager
but
there
is
something
different
with
this
beer
it
boasts
that
it
has
the
taste
of
chestnuts
but
id
have
to
be
hard
pressed
to
guess
this
solely
from
tasting
it
though
it
has
some
sort
of
interesting
earthy
flavour
and
i
kind
of
like
it
i
tried
this
beer
on
march
27
2009
after
pourchasing
from
one
of
my
local
lcbo
outlets
the
beer
poured
a
translucent
reddish
gold
with
a
1
thick
white
head
which
quickly
dissipated
the
aroma
was
sour
grainy
malt
and
some
floral
notes
the
mouthfeel
was
medium
bodied
with
medium
carbonation
the
flavour
was
grainy
malt
some
toffee
hints
and
a
bitter
finish
this
one
skirts
the
vienna
lager
genre
but
the
color
is
not
right
just
the
same
it
is
a
sturdy
flavorful
munchenstyle
lager
that
can
compete
with
any
commercial
munich
amber
also
this
beer
is
obviously
in
the
wrong
category
when
poured
into
glass
the
foam
was
almost
white
in
color
with
a
somwhat
yellow
haze
and
smooth
the
color
was
a
beautiful
amber
the
smell
was
woody
wheat
and
earthy
with
a
small
hint
of
flowers
taste
had
a
large
overtone
of
earth
almost
dirt
small
hints
of
wheat
and
flowers
and
a
small
citrus
undertone
the
earthy
tone
was
very
overpowering
mouthfeel
lightbodied
drinkability
after
tasting
the
earthydirt
tones
of
the
beer
it
stops
with
an
almost
nasty
taste
no
wonder
it
was
on
sale
one
of
the
worst
sessions
ive
had
a
hot
summer
day
and
a
sixpack
of
pietra
would
be
a
nice
combo
if
you
want
to
try
something
slightly
different
overall
a
highly
mediocre
beer
i
wouldnt
seek
it
out
but
its
also
not
totally
unpleasant
dark
gold
with
a
big
head
this
is
a
pleasant
nutty
marzen
very
drinkable
and
well
finished
the
beer
shows
the
chestnut
flavour
as
it
warms
up
and
opens
up
a
bigger
mouthfeel
and
more
complex
flavour
than
expected
from
a
corsican
beer
worth
trying
d
this
beer
is
pretty
drinkable
because
it
tastes
good
and
is
rather
on
the
light
side
overall
its
a
pretty
simple
brew
tasty
and
refreshing
but
nothing
spectacular
an
interesting
brew
considering
it
has
chestnut
flour
in
it
not
bad
at
all
as
for
drinkability
itd
be
fine
to
have
a
couple
d
the
chestnut
flour
gives
this
beer
a
complexity
that
takes
it
a
step
above
other
beers
of
this
type
not
bad
overall
but
not
something
id
put
on
a
must
try
list
really
solid
atmosphere
solid
appearance
and
a
really
pleasing
interesting
but
not
in
an
offensive
way
more
in
an
intriguing
way
nose
distinctive
flavor
but
not
in
a
strange
secret
ingredient
which
overwhelms
way
and
seemed
like
it
may
have
been
a
good
idea
but
in
effect
just
distracts
from
the
beer
way
just
in
a
unique
flavor
and
solid
balance
way

is
a

a

this
is
an
interesting
beer
its
not
very
hoppy
or
sumptuosly
malty
but
it
does
have
its
own
appeal
the
weird
musty
flavor
is
not
unpleasant
and
adds
a
unique
character
to
the
beer
its
not
oxidization
but
somewhat
similar
maybe
it
has
something
to
do
with
the
chestnut
flour
used
not

almost
unpleasant

d
this

to
be
sure
it
really
defies
classification
after
one
i
cant
say
that
i
really
know
if
i
like
it
or
not
it
has
an
interesting

that
is
puzzling
but
might
get
tiresome
after

glad
i

this

had
a

that
featured
a

bitter
middle
and
malt
finish
all
of
it
punctuated
by
sweetness
that
was
fleeting
bubblegum
kept
coming
to

overall
a
tasty
brew
although
chestnuts
didnt
particularly
stand
out
its
too
bad
some
beers
dont
turn
out
as
interesting
as
they
sound
the
sweetness
of
the
nut
is
far
more
noticeable
than
its
flavour
that
one
lovely
distinct
element
aside
the
beer
possesses
no
more
texture
or
character
than
any
other
amber
beer
mainstream
or
otherwise
its
curious
how
mediterranean
beers
all
seem
to
pair
so
poorly
with

little
too
much

the

chestnuts
are

and
again
not

what
they

provided
i
would
not

it
is

better
than
average
supermarket
beers
maybe
i
will
drink
it
again
it
is
strange
but
drinkable
very
intrigued
by
this
beer
when
i
came
upon
the
bottle
chestnuts
in
beer
hmmm
that
could
be
good
well
the
beer
pours
an
appealing
color
burnt
ambers
copper
and
bronze
all
of
differing
tones
capped
with
a
simple
and
shallow
white
head
its
a
decent
looking
beer
the
aroma
carries
a
little
malt
and
sugar
but
little
else
the
taste
is
restrained
but
there
is
a
notable
nut
character
i
expected
the
chestnut
to
stand
out
more
i
was
thinking
of
the
sweet
meat
inside
a
roasted
chestnut
but
got
chestnut
flour
theres
a
touch
of
bitterness
and
rustic
qualities
that
i
assume
come
from
the
nuts
along
with
a
bit
of
chestnut
flavor
that
carries
on
throughout
the
beer
medium
body
but
a
nice
flavor
the
finish
is
bitter
and
firm
it
could
be
a
little
more
intense
certainly
but
i
applaud
the
effort
and
enjoyed
having
something
interesting
it
really
tastes
like
a
typical
beer

the

the

i
dont

that
ive

that

a

without

not
monotonous
a
refreshing
dunkel
not
overly
sweet
or
cloying
resulting
in
high
drinkability
but
very
low
complexity
nevertheless
i
would
prefer
having
this
to
any
adjunct
lager
but
that
is
it
overall
complimented
with
a
mediumrare
steak
this
beer
is
even
better
straight
and
simple
salud
this
beer
might
be
nice
for
those
living
in
portugal
but
my
palate
is
more
advanced
than
this
not
trying
to
be
a
snob
here
but
man
this
is
just
not
a
good
beer
glad
it
was
a
small
bottle
oh
and
the
burp
provides
more
of

flavors
now
i
want
to
light
up
some
sugar
and
see
if
i
can
replicate
that
flavor
an
okay
beer
and
a
welcome
change
for
the
scores
of
pale
lager
portugal
has
to
offer
this
one
is
by
no
stretch
a
fantastic
beer
but
it
is
a
pleasant
enough
one
and
definitely
worth
a
try
if
youre
in
the
country
o
decent
unexciting
but
very
drinkable
o
expected
more
portuguese
market
hunger
for
better
personality
beers
od
more
of
a
mishmash
than
anything
it
was
an
ok
beer
just
lacked
structure
and
purpose
for
me
kinda
like
they
didnt
know
what
they
were
trying
to
do
i
didnt
dislike
it
but
i
was
ready
for
something
much
better
other
than
the
wateriness
which
is
a
pretty
big
problem
nothing
taking
away
from
the
drinkability
but
not
much
making
you
want
to
drink
more
either
for
0
65
euro
from
a
lisbon
convenience
store
you
could
do
worse
very
thin
and
really
not
worthy
of
a
lot
of
discussion
its
bland
neutral
and
really
quite
unexciting
d
easy
enough
to
drink
and
of
a
completely
sessionable
strength
no
complaints
while
i
wont
necessarily
seek
this
out
again
it
definitely
is
a
tastywelldone
selection
for
its
style
worth
a
try
purchased
plaza
liquors
tucson
az
after
being
in
portugal
for
several
days
without
any
hints
of
anything
other
than
basic
golden
lagers
i
was
pleasantly
surprised
to
find
this
at
a
local
grocer
still
somewhat
nervous
from
my
experience
thus
far
i
only
bought
one
when
i
opened
it
i
was
happy
to
catch
a
big
roasty
smell
with
some
caramel
undertones
i
poured
it
in
my
glass
and
enjoyed
the
deep
dark
amber
almostbrown
color
with
a
nice
light
tan
head
that
leaves
a
fair
amount
of
lacing
upon
drinking
i
was
blown
away
to
taste
rich
roasted
malt
and
toffee
with
hints
of
coffee
i
had
been
just
about
ready
to
give
up
on
my
beer
tasting
while
in
portugal
until
i
found
this
gem
the
mouthfeel
was
a
little
disappointing
in
that
it
was
slightly
overcarbonated
and
left
a
slightly
slick
feeling
on
the
tongue
but
after
having
this
beer
i
got
it
everywhere
i
went
very
drinkable
thank
you
sagres
overall
not
a
bad
brew
but
nothing
to
go
out
of
your
way
to
get
on
a
final
note
one
of
the
best
brews
from
portugal
although
thats
not
saying
much
the
beer
itself
is
closer
to
a
dunkel
than
a
euro
dark
lager
will
have
again
drinkability
average
beer
nothing
memorable
id
rather
drink
this
over
budweiser
any
day
and
its
the
same
price

the
liquor
store

some

wasnt

what
to

definitely
not
a
doppelbock
a

maybe
roast
at
the
front
of
the
palate
but
little
else
to
back
it
up
finishes
dry
reminiscent
of
xingu
must
be
a
portugese
speaking
thing
mouthfeel
lighter
than
expected
from
a
beer
this
color
carbonation
fine
drinkability
is
reasonable
goes
down
easy
but
not
much
to
commend
itself
flavorwise
overall
a
not
very
pleasant
dark
lager
the
first
impression
given
by
the
nose
is
lost
after
the
first
swallow
i
probably
will
not
give
this
one
another
try
when
first
poured
this
beer
showed
some
promise
dark
brown
and
shadowy
with
crimson
undertones
the
head
is
an
attractive
tan
color
and
the
aroma
is
of
roasted
and
somewhat
smoky
malts
somewhere
after
the
first
impression
though
this
one
dropped
the
ball
the
taste
is
onedimensional
and
very
restrained
its
dry
and
a
little
metallic
the
nice
smoky
roasted
character
of
the
aroma
is
lost
on
the
tongue
theres
some
chocolate
malt
flavor
but
it
doesnt
come
out
in
the
taste
very
light
body
and
a
willowy
finish
it
sort
of
left
me
wanting
more
good
effort
but
its
not
what
it
could
be
this
was
an
incredibly
drinkable
dark
lager
i
recommend
it
highly
this
may
be
the
best
of
the
porteguese
beers
although
that
is
not
saying
much
definitely
below
usuk
beer
standards
the
beer
pours
a
dark
brownblack
color
with
a
12
tan
head
that
slowly
fades
to
lacing
the
aroma
is
good
it
has
a
rich
and
creamy
dark
malt
aroma
that
boasts
of
crystal
roasted
and
chocolate
malts
the
taste
is
decent
it
has
a
weak
and
watery
malt
feel
that
boasts
of
roasted
and
chocolate
malts
its
easy
going
but
quite
dry
and
earthy
on
the
finish
it
has
some
metallic
aftertastes
the
mouthfeel
is
decent
also
it
is
a
medium
bodied
beer
with
adequategood
carbonation
i
was
hoping
for
a
thicker
creamier
body
this
is
a
good
drinking
dark
lager
but
it
could
be
so
much
better
i
would
classify
this
as
a
schwarzbier
style
a
very
nice
presentation
but
it
all
goes
downhill
from
there
the
brew
is
appealing
to
behold
and
sniff
but
thats
about
it
a
bland
weakened
dunkel
lager
probably
geared
for
duller
palates
it
reminds
me
of
something
like
abs
bareknuckle
stout
in
the
fact
that
it
feels
dumbed
down
to
appeal
to
the
consumer
that
would
like
to
drink
a
dark
beer
but
cant
handle
the
bittersweetness
id
pass
on
this
if
youre
looking
to
try
a
quality
brew
from
portugal
this
beer
poured
a
deep
mahogany
brown
color
very
clear
and
was
topped
with
a
creamy
lacy
head
pleasant
and
subtle
aroma
of
small
bits
of
chocolate
coffee
and
roasted
grains
the
taste
is
dry
and
bittersweet
has
some
chocolate
nutty
texture
the
body
is
light
and
flavorful
i
enjoyed
this
easy
drinking
dark
beer
it
was
1
00
and
from
portugal
the
first
beer
id
seen
from
that
country
its
a
shame
the
flavor
doesnt
deliver
on
the
aromas
promise
because
if
it
did
this
beer
would
actually
be
quite
good
as
it
is
however
its
simply
soso
even
disappointing
after
that
initial
buildup
if
i
ever
find
myself
in
portugal
ill
drink
this
and
not
feel
at
all
putupon
at
home
though
its
not
something
ill
buy
again
in
spite
if
it
being
rather
drinkable
in
its
way
it
comes
across
a
tad
boring

guess
i
just
dont

lighter
than
the
aroma
suggests
but
fairly
nice
with
a
smooth
chocolatey
and
gently
molassestinged
maltiness
the
bitterness
is
in
balance
but
display
a
little
roughness
in
the
dry
finish
which
lingers
with
some
light
roastiness
this
beer
has
some
character
to
it
but
is
overall
a
bit
light
leaving
it
just
a
bit
better
than
your
average
beer
not
sure
what
this
was
meant
to
be
not
truly
an
offensive
beer
but
a
strange
and
ultimately
unsatisfying
one
overall
i
havent
had
this
one
in
a
while
a
nice
euro
dark
lager
that
was
easy
to
drink
refreshing
and
flavorful
with
good
drinkability
a
joyful
session
beer
i
had
low
expectations
and
i
was
positively
surprised
o
overall
a
surprisingly
good
beer
very
smooth
clean
and
drinkable
not
the
average
generic
dark
euro
lager
by
far
the
most
interesting
beer
ive
found
during
my
short
stay
in
portugal
think
of
it
as
a
beacon
of
hope
in
this
desert
of
craft
beer
a
very
nice
beer
and
one
that
took
me
a
little
by
surprise
there
is
a
good
balance
of
taste
and
aroma
with
the
two
pretty
evenyl
matched
and
there
is
a
fair
bit
of
favour
in
each
sip
when
in
portugal
drink
the
rose
wine
is
my
advice
tastes
like
an
english
brown
ale
which
i
wasnt
expecting
quite
refreshing
and
sweet
poured
into
a
seattle
beer
week
pint
glass
pours
a
dark
mahogany
amber
with
reddish
tones
thin
light
tan
head
dissipates
immediately
to
slight
patches
of
bubbles
on
the
surface
very
light
aroma
of
sweet
malt
with
some
toasted
malt
a
hint
of
dark
fruit
reminiscent
of
a
light
doppelbock
flavor
follows
with
bready
and
toasted
malt
faint
dark
fruit
slight
hops
very
similar
to
a
bock
but
dryer
nice
malty
finish
more
flavorful
than
most
euro
dark
lagers
but
not
as
sweet
and
intense
as
a
good
bock
light
to
medium
body
with
a
hint
of
carbonation
a
pleasant
lager
with
a
lowkey
but
nice
malty
taste
nothing
really
stands
out
o
tastes
almost
like
a
dopplebock
but
not
as
rich
very
well
balanced
and
tasty
i
like
this
one
enough
that
i
can
definitely
see
myself
picking
up
a
bottle
again
somewhere
between
an
american
amber
a
bock
and
a
biere
de
garde
im
liking
where
this
one
is
sitting
11
2
oz
single
not
a
bad
looking
beer
at
all
nice
amber
body
and
a
good
thick
creme
coloured
head
aroma
isnt
to
bad
either
caramel
bit
of
nut
resiny
hop
deep
in
the
back
sweet
malt
driven
flavour
as
per
style
slightly
toasty
slight
hazelnut
actually
very
nice
liked
the
palate
on
this
one
quite
full
and
also
smooth
im
going
to
say
this
is
quite
a
nice
dunkel
im
way
against
the
grain
on
this
one
it
isnt
anything
superb
but
it
will
get
the
job
done
probably
could
have
used
a
tad
less
sweetness
and
a
bit
more
bdy
the
taste
was
like
the
smell
or
aroma
there
was
roasted
malts
mild
hops
and
touch
a
caramel
and
a
hint
of
other
spices
a
nice
balance
of
sweetbitterness
to
the
finish
not
to
dry
nor
sweet
this
was
a
pleasant
surprise
this
is
probably
a
popular
beer
in
its
homeland
its
sweet
full
crisp
easy
to
drink
and
has
a
fairly
high
abv
for
a
standard
lager
overall
a
pretty
quality
example
of
a
brew
in
a
category
loaded
with
pretty
bad
beers
glad
to
have
been
able
to
try
it
not
bad
at
all
this
is
a
nonoffensive
beer
thats
very
easy
to
drink
its
not
going
to
wow
you
but
if
youre
beer
choices
are
slim
its
worth
a
try
drinkability
while
the
flavor
is
not
bad
the
lack
of
some
balancing
hops
flavor
and
the
general
oversweetness
would
make
this
one
a
little
difficult
to
take
as
a
session
beer
i
wont
have
a
problem
finishing
this
one
though
had
this
in
sagres
and
was
quite
happy
with
the
amber
pour
had
a
good
amount
of
just
offwhite
head
that
dissipated
pretty
quickly
smelled
nice
with
mild
roasted
malt
and
toffee
tasted
pretty
similar
just
a
little
bit
sweeter
nicely
carbonated
leaving
me
with
a
smooth
mouthfeel
my
kind
of
amber
lager
i
could
drink
a
bunch
the
mouth
has
excellent
carbonation
which
helps
overcome
an
average
feel
drinkability
is
just
ok
given
the
sweetness
nice
looking
reddish
amber
puts
up
a
full
head
but
fades
rather
quickly
faint
sweet
candylike
malt
aroma
tastes
ok
nut
brownish
sweet
and
a
little
fruity
a
heartier
offering
than
the
adjunct
cervesas
drinks
pretty
easy
id
have
another
not
bad
drinkability
a
unique
brew
and
the
best
of
the
sagres
line
i
have
tried
very
complex
i
would
get
another
six
pack
mouthfeel
is
lightish
as
is
the
carbonation
this
is
quite
good
and
easy
drinking
my
first
brew
from
portugal
and
im
quite
pleased
with
it
one
that
is
easytodrink
when
looking
for
something
sweet
and
light
it
is
an
easy
drinking
amber
lager
drinkability
kind
of
an
odd
tasting
beer
to
me
not
too
fond
of
it
overall
average
for
the
style
perhaps
a
bit
too
sweet
for
my
taste
overall
a
satiating
and
balanced
amber
lager
an
interesting
beer
although
the
level
of
sweetness
does
not
recommend
it
for
a
hot
day
i
could
give
this
one
another
try
d
not
very
tasty
but
it
goes
down
easy
simply
because
there
isnt
much
to
it
its
worth
drinking
if
your
alternative
is
a
fizzyyellowbeer
but
i
would
prefer
something
a
bit
more
flavorful
in
beer
starved
portugal
this
is
one
of
the
better
offerings
still
this
wouldnt
stand
up
to
the
micros
in
america
cheers
i
have
had
this
beer
here
several
times
over
the
past
few
years
at
this
establishment
it
appears
to
be
one
of
the
restaurants
staple
beers
the
beer
is
a
very
nice
dark
cola
color
that
produced
a
very
nice
thick
offwhite
head
that
is
well
retained
the
beer
has
a
lighter
sweet
malt
aroma
as
does
the
taste
but
the
taste
is
certainly
more
full
the
beer
has
a
lighter
feel
to
it
it
is
smooth
and
creamy
and
good
to
the
last
drop
this
beer
is
really
well
done
i
am
a
huge
fan
a
great

dry
finish
i
was
introduced
to
this
beer
at
a
social
gathering
so
i
wasnt
really
able
to
give
it
my
full
tasting
experience
attention
but
i
liked
it
so
much
i
decided
to
post
for
me
the
rich
dark
ebony
appearance
was
very
appealing
enhanced
by
the
bottle
packaging
i
didnt
have
access
to
proper
tasting
glassware
but
on
direct
pour
some
head
appeared
but
quickly
dissipated
which
was
somewhat
disappointing
from
an
aesthetic
standpoint
but
as
i
found
out
this
in
no
way
degraded
the
positive
experience
for
me
also
the
lower
carbonation
made
it
much
lighter
on
the
midsection
aroma
was
slightly
raisiny
slightly
chocolaty
to
me
and
again
very
inviting
initial
wash
over
the
tongue
was
smooth
and
creamy
with
a
pleasantly
sweet
aftertaste
which
i
loved
and
just
balanced
with
the
right
amount
of
bitterness
overall
this
beer
for
me
is
probably
best
in
fallwinter
months
with
biggerflavored
meals
and
would
probably
make
for
some
fantastic
recipes
as
well
as
complement
some
deserts
but
i
thoroughly
enjoyed
it
on
a
warmer
evening
overall
i
tend
to
like
dark
european
lagers
and
this
is
among
the
better
of
them
id
definitely
have
this
again

o
a

thats
a
cross
between
a
munich
dunkel
and
a
schwarzbier
i
would
love
to
sample
this
fresh
at
the
source
its
the
type
of
dark
lager
i
love
to
find
o
being
a
czech
dark
lager
i
expected
more
saaz
hops
its
certainly
well
made
but
like
i
said
its
just
too
sweet
at
the
end
of
the
day
still
pretty
good
o
nice
complexity
and
layers
of
flavors
but
honestly
a
bit
overpowering
the
coffee
is
a
little
too
dominating
if
this
were
subdued
a
bit
the
subtleties
of
the
other
flavors
would
work
better
in
the
overall
scheme
however
still
good
plays
like
a
brown
or
a
porter
the
sour
aftertaste
was
unsatisfying
light
molasses
and
sweetened
coffee
in
the
aroma
some
toasted
marshmallow
and
sweet
grains
and
coarse
yeast
flavors
are
similarly
lightly
sweet
toasted
grains
molasses
and
honeyed
toast
feels
a
bit
thin
but
not
out
of
place
for
the
style
easy
to
have
several
certainly
no
chore
to
drink
simple
but
tasty
enough
worth
trying
after
enjoying
the
pils
figured
id
jump
right
into
this
guy
the
cousin
it
pours
a
clear
dark
sienna
topped
by
over
a
finger
of
dusty
wan
khaki
foam
the
nose
comprises
husky
barley
and
a
touch
of
lightly
watereddown
maple
syrup
its
insanely
simplistic
yet
still
pleasant
right
on
the
taste
holds
notes
of
darkly
toasted
malts
bruleed
cocoa
and
what
seems
like
some
blackstrap
molasses
things
are
darker
sweeter
than
i
imagined
to
say
the
least
thing
is
everything
is
too
light
to
make
it
stick
so
to
speak
like
a
thick
stout
or
porter
would
im
not
sure
what
to
think
of
this
frankly
things
are
overly
sweet
a
bit
too
roastyish
a
complete
pendulum
swing
from
the
usual
watereddown
roast
that
normally
finds
its
way
into
these
euro
darks
the
body
is
a
light
medium
with
a
light
moderate
carbonation
and
a
relatively
dry
finish
overall
i
just
couldnt
deal
with
the
nearcloying
sweetness
of
this
beer
it
was
all
too
much
i
think
i
prefer
the
basic
lager
to
the
dark
one
in
this
case
it
seems
a
little
thin
for
what
it
is
and
the
lager
yeast
sort
of
clashes
with
the
mildly
tannic
grain
feel
but
i
like
the
beer
on
the
whole
and
its
one
of
those
darker
beers
you
can
have
with
a
big
meal
or
drink
by
the
pitcher
during
the
game
and
not
get
full
so
in
that
context
its
a
winner
there
is
a
nice
light
brown
foam
head
on
it
at
the
pout
but
it
dissipates
rather
quickly
leaving
a
silky
medium
brown
beer
with
a
ruby
glow
in
the
bright
light
notes
of
chocolate
malt
wheat
and
a
little
oxidation
arise
in
the
smell
and
the
taste
holds
those
aromatics
accountable
as
the
two
sensory
experiences
are
essentially
identical
finish
is
longer
than
it
is
in
other
dark
lagers
not
quite
done
or
something
but
the
low
alcohol
and
lighter
medium
body
help
it
drink
easy
less
of
a
classic
than
the
original
but
there
is
a
nuttiness
i
like
in
it
and
i
appreciate
its
deep
roots
better
on
draft
than
in
a
bottle
too
finally
got
to
try
this
one
i
have
been
looking
forward
to
it
underrated
and
very
appealing
beer
a
benchmark
for
dark
czech
lagers
no
doubt
about
that

i
have
to
wonder
what
it
might
be
like
if
i
had
a
fresh
bottle
but
this
somewhat
dated
beer
has
been
a
very
good
experience
decent
beer
but
nothing
special
good
if
you
are
looking
for
a
mellow
dark
lager
overall
not
bad
nothing
special
more
of
that
eastern
euro
style
herbal
earthy
vegetal
like
root
like
malt
thing
almost
like
there
is
a
root
beer
like
syrup
in
it
and
raw

etc
decent
hops
a
little
light
feeling
the
best
dark
lagers
are
traditionally
from
eastern
germany
and
czech
republic
within
this
geographical
region
this
brew
is
rather
unspectacular
nevertheless
a
very
clean
and
nifty
sample
of
the
style
there
might
be
more
spectacular
dark
lagers
out
there
but
you
dont
go
wrong
with
this
one
taste
is
similarly
dry
and
roasty
light
coffee
and
toast
clean
and
smooth
without
any
bitterness
quite
drinkable
though
it
gets
a
little
thin
in
the
body
lightly
carbonated
easily
sessionable
its
rare
within
this
style
to
be
dry
and
not
cloyingly
sweet
as
many
edls
can
be
this
leans
more
towards
english
porter
territory
though
its
still
unique
and
very
good
originally
grabbed
this
just
to
get
the
review
but
the
use
of
malts
here
is
actually
quite
nice
a
very
nice
toasted
nuttiness
and
the
roasted
flavors
work
well
awesome
balance
of
malt
flavors
across
the
spectrum
overall
impression
a
nice
alternative
to
the
classic
bohemian
pilsner
balancing
roasty
stout
like
properties
with
lager
like
drinkability
this
beer
deserves
a
place
in
the
occasional
session
takin
a
trip
to
the
dark
side
of
czech
lagers
this
stuff
pours
a
deep
midnight
garnet
topped
by
over
a
finger
of
khaki
foam
the
nose
comprises
mild
malted
milk
balls
light
dark
greens
and
a
hint
of
toast
the
taste
brings
in
more
of
the
same
with
a
bit
of
a
tealike
character
pervading
the
proceedings
the
body
is
a
hefty
light
with
a
very
light
moderate
carbonation
and
a
fluid
feel
overall
a
pretty
tasty
dark
lager
one
that
nudges
you
in
the
gut
with
its
dark
elbows
making
sure
not
to
say
anything
too
forward
too
offensive
or
even
too
loud
not
bad
at
all
stick
with
regular
czechvar
o
cool
beer
nothing
super
special
but
with
very
nice
mix
of
flavors
better
than
average
dark
lager
o
very
enjoyable
o
really
enjoyable
its
nice
to
drink
a
beer
this
complex
that
is
under

abv
overall
a
beer
that
needs
to
be
tried
very
recommendable
o
a
nice
light
dark
beer
im
not
wowed
by
the
flavor
but
its
good
peaty
brown
coloured
beer
with
a
head
which
soon
dissipates
to
a
rim
job
roasted
malt
nose
with
a
hint
of
marmite
well
carbonated
in
the
abundance
of
very
small
bubbles
sense
with
a
rather
woody
very
slightly
smoky
taste
hops
very
much
relegated
to
the
background
as
malt
dominates
fairly
one
dimensional
but
eminently
drinkable

o
an
outstanding
czech
dark
lager
although
probably
at
its
best
here
at
the
brewery
trying
the
beer
again
many
km
from
the
brewery
i
find
the
beer
to
be
indistinguishable
from
that
at

carbonation
is
a

very
drinkable
the
bitter
roasted
notes
that
you
might
expect
in

dark
lager
are
attenuated
here
as
a
result
it
slides
down
all
too
easily
makes
a
good
introduction
to
the
style
and
well
worth

a
decent
well

certainly
better
than

wood
earthy
chocolate
mouth
has
dried
fruits
chocolate
and
a
the
burnt
wood
earthy
finish
medium
to
light
body
i
would
have
like
it
a
little
bit
more
strong
drinkable
and
good
but
i
prefer
the
usual
lager
one
d
the
beer
goes
down
smoothly
and
is
very
easy
to
drink
making
it
quite
sessionable
bottle
solicited
from
intimex
super
market
in
hoan
kiem
district
hanoi
served
in
my
budvar
glass
the
original
imported
dark
lager
nice
almost
reminds
me
of
a
stout
with
the
dark
brown
tint
and
dark
beige
foam
gave
me
two
inches
of
fluffy
foam
with
some
light
lacing
smells
of
coffee
and
slight
metallic
smell
taste
is
like
toffeecoffee
slightly
bitter
malts
and
some
balls
mouthfeel
is
medium
bodied
drinkability
is
high
i
wish
i
had
picked
up
more
but
will
seek
them
out
later
cheers
budvar
i
like
you
as
much
as
your
cousin
regular
budvar
budweiser
is
an
insult
to
your
heritage
a
mouth
with
spicy
enough
coffee
in
the
aftertaste
that
gives
a
fairly
strong
bitterness
ibu
quite
high
i
presume
not
necessarily
powerful
but
very
persistent
the
nose
smells
the
coffee
but
more
style
cafe
macchiato
full
tasting
there
are
also
touches
of
acidity
almost
like
a
winey
side
maybe
coffee
liqueur
the
finish
is
a
little
licorice
what
makes
a
strange
contrast
between
the
entrance
and
slightly
winey
and
acid
output
completely
bitter
this
side
had
advantages
in
the
pale
lager
but
here
in
the
dark
lager
it
looks
worse
thanks
to
lukie
at
corkers
cellars
for
this
one
the
beer
was
well
within
expiry
and
tasted
very
fresh
i
will
certainly
be
buying
this
again
it
is
a
very
complex
drinkable
delicious
dark
lager
seems
like
just
a
bunch
of
dark
malts
thrown
into
regular
budvar
considering
its
a
good
lager
to
begin
with
thats
no
bad
thing
d
a
very
drinkable
beer
one
that
i
could
definitely
spend
an
evening
with
overall
not
a
bad
beer
but
personally
i
think
the
beer
lacks
body
most
flavors
are
just
not
it
didnt
finish
this
one
and
will
probably
not
have
it
again
d
quite
decent
the
balance
of
the
sweet
with
the
bitter
and
the
lighter
body
make
it
drinkable
the
aroma
is
mostly
dark
malt
but
there
are
notes
of
yeast
and
sour
cherry
dry
tastes
of
caramel
toffee
feels
of
sweet
bready
maltiness
great
smooth
finish
very
drinkable
great
easy
beer
to
enjoy
while
traveling
taste
of
sweet
bitter
chocolate
bitterness
is
just
at
the
right
level
it
balances
between
quite
hoppy
and
melting
with
the
maltbitterness
coffee
and
roasted
malts
are
abundant
a
clean
malt
profile
where
the
hops
are
almost
hidden
but
can
still
display
some
spicy
saazlike
character
overall
a
very
pleasant
one
this
nothing
groundbreaking
but
a
well
made
and
very
quaffable
example
of
a
dark
lager
everytime
i
drink
this
dark
lager
i
am
reminded
of
coffee
and
just
the
slightest
hint
of
burnt
caramel
two
of
my
favourite
flavours
the
colour
is
more
of
a
very
very
dark
red
than
black
and
the
head
is
usually
tinged
with
a
slight
brown
the
head
is
usually
about
an
inch
deep
and
disappears
quite
quickly
in
the
mouth
this
lager
manages
to
be
a
paradox
of
smoothness
and
bitterness
a
paradox
i
like
muchly
mouthfeel
is
smooth
good
carbonation
and
enough
body
to
lend
enjoyability
but
without
hurting
an
extremely
high
drinkability
md
the
body
is
just
about
right
to
match
its
low
alc
strength
while
the
texture
is
softlyspritzy
and
quite
clean
without
any
undesirable
sugary
or
sticky
finishing
touch
as
happens
in
quite
a
few
sweet
dark
lagers
made
in
europe
overall
the
condition
is
not
bad
at
all
but
compared
with
my
first
encounter
with
this
beer
in
the
czech
republic
which
was
as
fresh
and
perfect
as
it
could
get
this
beer
is
strangely
much
milder
and
boring
i
wonder
if
its
to
do
with
the
psychological
effect
of
drinking
local
beers
in
the
local
area
all
in
all
a
solid
beer
without
much
complexity
to
play
with
on
the
palate
i
like
this
beer
and
think
that
i
could
drink
more
than
one
in
a
sessionbut
i
am
not
sure
if
i
would
drink
it
all
night
long
i
quite
like
this
beer
at
it
never
dissapoints
and
at
the
moment
i
have
a
few
in
the
fridge
excellent
mouthfeel
due
to
the
maltyness
very
drinkable
and
would
be
a
pleasure
to
drink
as
my
everyday
beer
if
i
were
a
resident
of
prague
d
much
prefer
dark
bohemian
lagers
to
the
light
a
nice
offering
but
not
the
most
flavoursome
out
there
this
is
an
ok
beer
not
one
i
will
rush
out
and
find
again
but
drinkable
d
an
ok
beer
which
quenches
the
thirst
but
not
overly
interesting
pours
a
clear
dark
brown
under
a
1
5
finger
offwhite
head
that
fades
fairly
slowly
to
thick
film
and
collar
sweet
caramel
nose
both
strong
and
enticing
the
mouth
is
wellcarbonated
light
but
fairly
sticky
nice
combination
here
of
candy
sweet
caramel
and
roasted
nuts
followed
by
smoe
mild
dry
hops
the
caramel
lasts
the
longest
leaving
a
sweet
aftertaste
accented
by
a
touch
of
bitter
nice
product
tasty
and
refreshing
pleasant
to
clarify
when
i
say
sweet
i
mean
it
tastes
like
someone
added
a
few
packets
of
equal
at
bottling
not
a
desireable
attribute
in
beer
not
too
bad
really
decent
aroma
body
appearance
flavor
reminds
me
a
bit
of
a
soft
drink
and
carbonation
is
a
tad
aggressive
finish
is
like
flavor
yet
not
too
bad
you
could
do
a
lot
worse
this
might
be
the
best
beer
out
of
this
brewery
i
could
see
having
another
of
these
overall
this
is
a
decent
beer
with
potential
but
not
without
flaws
the
carbonation
is
a
bit
overthetop
and
the
sweetness
could
be
toned
down
a
bit
better
balancing
would
definitely
make
this
one
a
winner
o
ok
i
wish
the
hop
presence
was
a
little
more
notable
there
is
only
just
enough
to
keep
it
from
being
cloyingly
sweet
the
malt
character
is
similar
to
a
bock
pecatonica
nightfall
lager
3
55
overall
a
very
enjoyable
beer
that
id
easily
drink
more
of
not
real
sure
what
to
make
of
this
one
try
it
if
you
love
molasses
i
guess
will
be
interested
to
see
what
they
do
with
the
taproom
down
the
road
yet
another
random
new
wisconsin
brewery
coming
into
the
area
this
offering
is
a
dark
lager
brewed
with
cascade
centennial
and
hallertauer
hops
alright
spoken
in
a
fake
australian
accent
it
pours
a
dark
garnetbrown
topped
by
a
finger
or
so
of
ashen
foam
the
nose
comprises
walnuts
mild
coffee
dark
greens
and
a
kiss
of
toasted
rye
bread
the
taste
brings
in
more
of
the
same
along
with
a
distinct
vein
of
strong
dark
molasses
that
clashes
with
the
milder
notes
surrounding
it
the
body
is
a
light
medium
with
a
moderate
carbonation
and
a
slightly
watery
feel
overall
a
decent
dark
lager
but
that
weird
molassesy
bit
hinders
things
flavorwise
and
the
overlyhigh
carbonation
and
a
watery
body
dont
help
matters
either
beyond
those
issues
though
its
pretty
good
altogether
i
can
see
this
as
being
a
nice
easydrinker
in
the
summer
heat
as
its
not
too
strong
and
is
rather
refreshing
in
its
own
right
its
not
bad
for
the
price
i
paid
for
it
6
99
but
im
sure
it
would
be
a
better
beer
within
code
overall
drinkability
ive
had
this
before
and
i
remember
it
with
more
fondness
then
but
it
was
the
summer
and
i
had
it
with
a
spicy
meal
which
is
where
i
think
this
beer
would
shine
better
it
doesnt
quite
work
well
in
the
winter
with
a
simple
stir
fry
still
i
rather
enjoyed
it
and
i
wouldnt
mind
another
but
i
need
to
find
the
right
food
to
pair
it
with
overall
an
easy
drinking
somewhat
sweet
beer
that
would
pair
well
with
spicy
asian
or
mexican
food
tasty
beer
no
bottling
date
found
i
like
this
beer
and
will
look
forward
to
my
next
drink
good
value
and
pairs
well
with
food
but
i
wouldnt
seek
it
out
a
pretty
standard
toasty
malty
dark
lager
flavorful
enough
nothing
wrong
with
it
as
mentioned
above
the
kind
of
beer
that
feels
right
to
drink
on
a
warm
evening
pours
a
solid
dark
brown
with
clear
ruby
highlights
at
the
edges
and
a
huge
creamy
off
white
head
that
takes
forever
to
dissipate
aromas
of
molasses
overwhelm
me
as
soon
as
i
get
beer
to
meet
glass
hints
of
smoke
roast
and
chocolate
round
out
the
aroma
but
my
god
this
smells
like
sugary
unfermented
molasses
mostly
wow
the
flavor
does
not
stray
from
the
aroma
much
sweet
brown
sugar
and
molasses
run
the
show
here
light
prunes
and
plums
in
the
flavor
as
well
and
little
to
counter
the
malty
or
adjucty
sweetness
in
this
beer
medium
to
thick
body
with
a
light
to
moderate
level
of
carbonation
and
a
sweet
thick
sugary
syrupy
mouthfeel
i
have
no
way
to
tell
how
old
this
bottle
is
but
i
suspect
it
may
be
less
than
fresh
that
said
the
burnt
sugar
and
molasses
seem
to
be
all
this
beer
offers
it
reminds
me
more
of
the
barley
malt
sodas
that
i
had
in
the
caribbean
than
actual
beer
this
is
one
of
those
beers
that
just
never
gets
talked
aboutno
hype
just
an
allaround
good
brew
it
is
way
outside
of
the
box
as
most
beers
in
this
realm
light
or
dark
are
dry
and
usually
lacking
any
real
complex
characteristics
it
is
the
same
thinking
of
the
sweeter
stouts
consumed
in
hotter
climates
for
something
completely
different
give
it
a
go
it
is
drinkable
not
unpleasant
but
nothing
special
on
a
global
scale
first
had
this
years
ago
when
it
was
known
as
creveca
negra
enjoyable
beer
i
dug
this
a
lot
not
what
i
expected
it
to
be
a
nice
rich
flavorful
beer
great
toasted
malt
character
fairly
nutty
with
just
enough
roast
to
not
overwhelm
some
off
flavors
but
not
am
offensive
beer
i
got
a
bottle
of
this
under
the
cerveza
negra
alias
as
a
part
of
a
mix
and
match
6
pack
i
included
it
on
a
whim
as
a
generally
enjoy
dark
lagers
and
had
never
heard
of
this
beer
i
was
very
pleasantly
surprised
even
drinking
it
straight
from
the
bottle
the
roasted
malts
and
caramel
tones
were
very
evident
it
was
an
extremely
smooth
lager
witha
great
mouthfeel
thick
but
not
porter
thick
it
was
exactly
what
a
dark
lager
should
feel
like
this
may
become
my
new
go
to
session
beer
pleasantly
surprised
i
would
pick
this
over
negra
modelo
all
day
long
o
enjoyable
and
better
than
expected
at
least
average
even
by
european
standards
from
your
options
in
the
p
i
if
you
are
unable
to
get
the
golden
eagle
this
is
your
best
bet
each
of
them
are
ok
though
there
are
far
worse
options
in
the
world
and
especially
in
the
philippines
a
very
nice
dark
beer
with
some
bold
delicious
presence
rich
and
satisfying
it
poured
a
nice
thick
tan
head
that
dissipated
into
a
nice
ring
around
the
edges
smelled
like
roasted
and
caramel
malt
period
tasted
like
roasted
and
caramel
malt
high
carbonation
fullbodied
a
little
sour
tastiing
at
first
but
the
aftertaste
was
sweet
and
wet
an
average
dark
lager
that
is
good
to
drink
during
the
winter
not
my
favorite
beer
overall
overall
this
is
the
first
dark
lager
ive
ever
tried
its
ok
its
like
a
brown
ale
with
just
heavier
flavors
not
a
bad
brew
really
especially
for
this
part
of
the
world
it
pours
quite
dark
from
the
bottle
chocolate
syrup
looking
with
a
one
inch
mocha
colored
head
with
surprisingly
good
retention
the
nose
is
real
malty
german
in
origin
like
an
extract
though
a
little
bit
off
and
not
totally
fresh
but
some
cocoa
powder
aroma
wakes
it
up
a
bit
the
flavor
doesnt
carry
as
much
chocolate
as
the
nose
but
it
is
yummy
all
the
same
a
little
bitterness
turns
metallic
in
the
finish
my
main
critique
plenty
drinkable
fuller
bodied
but
well
carbonated
fairly
priced
and
down
easy
not
so
nice
when
it
warms
up
but
if
you
drink
it
quickly
this
is
a
pretty
good
euro
style
dark
lager
wow
what
a
great
beer
always
wanted
to
try
it
they
have
new
bottles
a
now
im
sorry
i
wanted
so
long
a
dark
pour
which
makes
your
mouth
water
a
taste
that
goes
smooths
a
tasty
bit
of
malts
and
carmel
that
will
make
a
enjoy
night
for
anybody
only
5
0
so
drink
drink
drink
o
this
beer
seems
to
taste
like
a
sweeter
and
fruitier
version
of
a
schwartzbier
its
not
a
bad
choice
if
you
are
looking
for
something
thats
dark
but
still
extremely
drinkable
pours
a
dark
brown
substantial
tan
head
that
dissipates
quickly
very
smooth
extremely
malty
roasty
sweetness
with
a
unique
buttery
note
as
a
huge
fan
of
dark
beers
and
in
particular
schwarzbiersdark
lagers
i
would
have
to
rate
this
beer
as
one
of
the
best
more
flavorful
than
kostritzer
very
sessionable
pairs
well
with
mexican
and
spicy
asian
food
and
is
never
harsh
or
bitter
perfectly
balanced
not
as
dark
as
most
euro
darks
but
pretty
malty
and
definitely
not
watery
there
is
a
sweetness
to
this
that
is
interesting
but
not
entirely
pleasant
i
enjoyed
it
much
to
my
surprise
a
little
more
caramel
then
i
like
in
a
beer
as
i
do
prefer
the
beers
that
have
more
hops
presence
overall
strange
beer
with
lots
of
caramel
overpowering
all
other
flavoros
o
goes
down
pretty
easy
somewhat
tasty
not
too
filling
mild
kick
ok
representation
of
style
if
the
sweetness
didnt
hold
in
the
aftertaste
so
much
this
would
be
a
much
more
enjoyable
beer
tolerable
more
so
than
their
pils
and
light
lager
from
the
355
ml
bottle
it
pours
dark
brown
with
reddish
highlights
when
held
to
the
light
a
decent
enough
head
that
lingers
and
settles
into
a
ring
the
aroma
is
of
dark
sweet
roasted
malts
yeast
and
sugar
the
hops
are
more
in
the
background
while
the
body
is
nice
and
smooth
it
does
not
have
a
lot
of
texture
to
it
i
would
put
it
at
light
to
medium
the
taste
is
overly
sweet
and
malty
with
moderate
bitterness
and
a
clean
finish
it
brings
me
back
to
my
early
days
of
beer
drinking
when
i
would
drink
heineken
dark
michelob
dark
or
becks
dark
conclusion
without
doubt
this
is
the
best
euro
dark
lager
i
have
tasted
it
far
exceeded
my
expectations
and
is
surprisingly
smooth
and
balanced
the
flavors
are
not
as
excellent
as
one
might
expect
from
a
small
established
craft
brewery
but
they
are
outstanding
for
a
large
macrotype
brewing
operation
the
beer
appears
a
deep
dark
brown
hue
with
beige
cap
that
fades
rapidly
leaving
random
traces
of
lacing
on
the
glass
the
aroma
offers
a
heavy
dose
of
brown
bread
pumpernickel
malt
fruit
smells
good
the
flavor
is
ok
i
like
the
aroma
better
a
bit
sweet
slightly
dry
in
the
finish
a
solid
example
of
the
style
folks
seem
to
rate
lagers
a
bit
low
in
my
opinion
while
this
beer
is
not
stellar
its
a
nice
example
of
the
style
offering
balance
and
complexity
in
both
the
aroma
and
flavor
i
would
have
this
again
pours
a
dark
chestnut
brown
color
w
a
thin
cocoa
head
average
lacing
on
my
snifter
glass
very
dark
nose
is
toffee
dark
fruit
and
roasted
malt
taste
is
actually
not
that
bad
toffee
malt
dark
fruit
and
slight
hops
maybe
some
coffee
in
the
background
feel
is
medium
a
little
flat
w
a
toffeecoffee
aftertaste
probably
the
weakest
point
of
this
beer
overall
this
isnt
bad
at
all
especially
for
the
style
cheers
m
the
sensation
is
pretty
good
there
is
a
balanced
flavor
and
aroma
it
is
pleasant
and
last
medium
to
long
for
a
nice
bittersweet
ending
more
sweet
than
bitter
12oz

a

and
taste
is
sweet

lightly
toasted
malts

with
light

finish
is
sweet
dark
malts
some
very
light
fruitiness
and
light
hops
flavor
is
lacking
and
becomes
bland
carbonation
turns
flat
and
ends
overly
sweet
overall
not
my
favorite
and
would
not
buy
again
d
an
all
around
solid
brew
it
boasts
an
interesting
flavor
profile
without
trying
to
do
too
much
didnt
expect
much
coming
in
but
this
beer
certainly
exceeded
expectations
overall
this
is
fun
to
drink
because
my
dad
has
plenty
of
stories
involving
being
too
young
too
far
from
home
and
having
this
beer
be
far
too
accessible
during
a
scary
time
long
ago
not
that
now
isnt
scary
as
well
but
thats
another
topic
for
another
website
pours
an
almost
opaque
super
dark
amberbrown
with
a
2
inch
tan
head
that
settles
to
a
small
cap
nice
foamy
rings
of
lace
mark
the
drink
down
smell
is
of
dark
malt
caramel
and
malted
milk
taste
is
of
roasty
dark
malt
malted
milk
powder
with
a
carameltoffee
finish
there
is
a
nice
roasty
bitterness
on
the
palate
after
each
sip
this
beer
has
a
lower
level
of
carbonation
with
a
medium
body
and
smooth
mouthfeel
overall
this
is
a
good
dark
lager
and
my
first
beer
from
the
philippines
i
would
definitely
get
this
one
again
in
the
future
this
isnt
a
bad
brew
the
flavors
are
nice
very
tasty
beer
great
surprise
darker
than
expected
the
pour
is
deep
brown
with
a
nice
topping
of
foam
and
lace
raw
barley
husk
cocoa
powder
and
a
sourdough
tang
form
the
main
flavor
components
with
grape
skin
and
sulfur
in
the
back
clean
and
fairly
full
for
the
style
better
than
the
usual
lagers
imported
from
tropical
locales
nice
for
the
style
but
im
sure
its
main
appeal
in
the
states
is
the
stubby
fancy
import
bottle
t
a
light
body
not
a
very
nice
flavour
is
so
flat
just
a
little
roast
no
end
at
all
overall
very
typical
asian
dark
lager
not
all
that
easy
to
drink
its
a
bit
to
sweet
for
me
a
decent
enough
dark
lager
given
its
predisposition
the
drawbacks
ever
so
slight
drinkable
yet
hardly
recommendable
when
compared
to
more
headier
euro
and
otherwise
competition
as
it
kind
of
lags
on
the
palate
after
a
while
dont
actually
ask
me
what
that
means
rjt
overall
i
could
drink
something
like
this
all
day
great
taste
less
filling
a
good
surprise
from
the
philippines
well
done
o
i
would
buy
again
overall
nice
thick
lager
with
great
malty
flavor
this
beer
is
pretty
nice
to
be
honest
it
has
nice
complexity
and
good
heft
a
solid
pickup
overall
this
brew
gives
off
the
appearance
of
a
nut
brown
ale
its
darker
in
color
but
still
transluscent
enough
to
see
through
it
its
got
a
roasted
aroma
to
it
but
its
not
strong
the
flavor
also
plays
the
same
role
its
more
full
flavored
than
most
beers
from
this
area
but
still
doesnt
compare
to
a
stout
its
got
more
of
a
lager
taste
than
a
roasted
flavor
to
it
drinkability
its
light
yet
flavorful
body
makes
for
a
great
drinkability
but
there
is
always
something
better
out
there
still
a
good
brew
drinkability
a
richly
tasty
and
eversodrinkable
beer
it
reminds
me
of
the
flavors
of
a
mild
ale
except
with
a
fruity
lager
kick
i
can
really
dig
it
san
miguel
dark
has
caused
me
to
raise
my
opinion
of
the
whole
philippine
archipelago
decent
drinkability
decent
but
unspectactular
fairly
smooth
with
light
effervescence
at
tip
of
tongue
medium
body
leans
towards
light
maltcaramelvanilla
aftertaste
lingers
and
tapers
off
nicely
very
good
brew
i
highly
recommend
it
san
miguel
was
my
favorite
import
for
as
long
as
i
can
remember
long
before
i
became
a
ba
this
is
very
much
as
i
remember
it
and
it
is
much
better
than
any
bmc
or
the
most
ubiquitous
import
swill
b
d
in
my
opinion
a
little
too
sweet
to
drink
more
than
one
in
a
session
the
beer
pours
a
hazy
medium
to
dark
brown
color
with
a
white
head
for
an
aroma
i
get
earthy
hops
dark
malt
caramel
toffee
and
bread
the
flavor
is
very
malty
with
some
toffee
and
bready
malts
as
well
as
some
earthy
hops
to
keep
the
beer
somewhat
balanced
medium
carbonation
and
medium
mouthfeel
looked
promising
but
never
really
wowed
me
in
any
area
dont
go
looking
for
this
but
drink
it
before
the
water
if
your
ever
in
manila
im
very
impressed
with
this
beer
its
given
me
hope
that
there
is
actually
good
asian
beer
out
there
appears
deep
cola
in
color
tan
head
goes
to
skim
and

is

dark

some
lite
hops
bite
a
touch
of
black
licorice
dry
slightly
bitter
aftertaste
mouithfeel
is
active
carbonation
a
touch
harsh
in
my
opinion
lightmedium
body
not
especially
smooth
but
ok
i
drank
this
years
ago
before
ba
and
enjoyed
it
now
its
just
a
decent
dark
euro
lager
how
things
have
changed
int
he
beer
world
overallsessionable
drinkable
if
a
bit
underpowered
pours
a
dark
rubybrown
that
wants
to
be
cloudily
opaque
but
doesnt
quite
get
there
the
frothy
tan
head
starts
out
as
a
thick
mass
but
dissipates
fairly
quickly
leaving
almost
no
lacing
behind
the
nose
holds
notes
of
dark
malts
dark
coffee
and
toasted
wheat
the
taste
basically
follows
with
the
harsher
aspects
of
coffee
pushed
to
the
fore
along
with
a
kind
of
overly
smoked
influence
all
told
its
as
though
the
smell
was
peat
smoked
and
soured
but
in
a
bad
way
leading
to
a
partly
objectionable
flavor
the
body
is
lightly
moderate
with
a
moderate
carbonation
and
a
thick
but
slippery
feel
overall
this
is
almost
a
pretty
good
brew
but
the
flavor
misses
the
mark
leading
to
a
feeling
of
if
only
nonetheless
it
spitefully
maintains
a
decently
high
level
of
drinkability
just
not
as
high
as
it
could
be
the
major
downfall
of
this
beer
is
that
the
taste
is
only
fair
not
great
but
at
least
it
is
inoffensive
in
other
areas
san
mig

taste
is
good
mostly
of
chocolate
malts
a
degree
of

in
the
mouth
and
has
good
drinkability
overall
this
is
a
good
quality
beer
pours
a
pretty
dark
reddish
color
body
with
a
huge
tan
colored
head
lasting
very
strong
malty
aroma
some
nuttiness
and
lots
of
earthiness
some
funkiness
too
like
ripe
bananas
somewhat
watery

somewhat
creamy
too
malty
earthy
aftertaste
some
bananas
in
the
taste
some
roasted
notes
not
too
shabby
carbonated
but
not
harsh
a
little
sweet
after
a
while
drinkability
not
so
bad
really
and
a
nice
surprise
after
the
poor
showing
of
their
unwelcome
flagship
lager
d
its
drinkable
but
id
probably
switch
to
something
else
after
one
or
two
a
dark

a
thick
foamy
lasting
light
brown
head
aroma
is

crisp
clean

medium

high

a

in

finish
quite
sessionable
not
too
bad
d
i
could
see
heart
burn
happening
after
a
few
of
these
but
nonetheless
it
goes
down
good
but
probably
isnt
the
beer
you
would
want
to
chug
and
finish
the
night
off
with
flavor
unfortunately
is
very
muted
compared
to
the
scent
still
a
heck
of
a
beer
that
if
i
had
to
classify
would
be
a
schwarzbier
nice
roasty
malt
character
with
a
hint
of
ale
fruitiness
i
actually
like
this
beer
quite
a
bit
and
would
be
more
than
happy
to
kick
it
in
the
philippines
with
this
tasty
lager
drinkability
easy
to
drink
not
overpowering
drinkablity
i
think
i
would
have
another
this
is
an
interesting
brew
i
really
appreciate
the
look
and
aroma
offered
but
find
the
flavors
to
be
sub
par
i
think
this
brew
to
be
at
best
average
concerning
the
overall
drinkability
however
i
must
admit
this
beer
does
get
better
as
is
goes
down
overall
i
would
not
purchase
this
beer
again
there
is
too
much
to
be
desired
however
it
is
easy
to
drink
i
would
say
simply
because
it
is
so
light
tastes
of
light
malts
a
bit
creamy
and
with
an
unexpected
lingering
finish
offers
good
carbonation
and
a
decent
feel
and
drink
fairly
decent
with
a
light
malt
structure
one
would
expect
from
the
latitude
of
origin
yet
far
from
the
hot
weather
styles
typical
thereof
a
very
robust
sweet
quaff
but
im
not
so
sure
that
id
call
it
a
euro
dark
lager
perhaps
an
asian
dark
lager
poured
from
the
bottle
into
a
pint
glass
the
beer
is
dark
burnt
amber
with
red
hues
the
head
is
caramel
and
quickly
diminishes
to
a
very
light
lace
the
nose
is
very
sweet
and
you
get
the
malts
and
spiciness
in
the
background
the
taste
is
ok
sweet
malt
forward
a
little
out
of
balance
due
to
the
sweetness
this
is
an
ok
session
beer
probably
would
not
purchase
it
but
would
drink
many
if
they
were
free
and
the
company
was
good
a
nice
dark
lager
would
certainly
revisit
this
beer
bottle
thanks
to
mmmbeer
pours
a
dark
black
color
which
is
reddish
when
held
up
to
a
light
source
a
small
white
head
a
pleasant
nutty
and
fruity
aroma
some
malt
too
the
flavor
is
quite
nice
tons
of
dark
fruits
plums
and
prune
but
also
something
quite
sweet
berries
perhaps
a
toasted
malt
and
a
bit
of
light
milk
chocolates
i
like
this
beer
it
is
full
of
flavor
and
well
made
d
this
reminds
me
of
newcastle
like
that
omnipresent
brew
there
is
nothing
wrong
with
some
watery
nutty
flavors
and
easy
drinkability
boring
but
unoffensive
sort
of
a
wallflower
really
d
a
good
drink
overall
sweet
and
very
smooth
to
consume
a
six
pack
wouldnt
go
to
waste
and
you
can
easily
drink
3
or
4
no
problem
despite
its
sweet
nature
poured
into
a
pint
glass
this
brew
was
a
very
dark
almost
black
color
with
a
minimal
tan
head
leaving
light
lacing
the
smell
was
slightly
sweet
with
some
caramel
and
fig
notes
the
taste
was
of
raisin
and
roasted
malts
this
brew
has
an
alcohol
finish
that
is
unusual
not
the
best
flavor
brew
nothing
i
was
really
looking
for
in
a
session
not
very
impressed
this
beer
poured
a
brownish
almost
black
color
but
when
i
held
my
glass
up
to
the
light
it
showed
a
dark
amber
color
and
looked
thin
the
head
was
34
inch
thick
with
a
brown
color
which
dissapeared
after
a
few
minutes
beer
smelled
of
sweet
roasted
grains
with
hints
of
caramel
and
toffee
w
a
slight
pungent
smell
that
creeps
through
as
the
beer
warms
up
i
could
smell
some
raisens
the
beer
has
a
sweet
malt
taste
of
butterscotch
caramel
there
is
bitterness
present
w
a
slight
burnt
aftertaste
smd
is
a
light
to
medium
body
beer
and
the
carbonation
is
good
i
would
like
to
try
this
beer
with
some
filipino
food
like
adobo
or
kare
kare
good
beer
overall
the
taste
is
very
smooth
with
a
great
sweetbitter
balance
light
tartness
and
a
lot
going
on
it
is
constantly
interesting
tantalizing
yet
pleasant
with
toasted
grain
licorice
chocolate
fruit
whisky
and
leaves
despite
a
full
flavour
and
palate
it
is
light
in
body
with
a
very
lively
engaging
palate
drinkablity
during
all
the
time
i
have
spent
in
the
philippines
i
have
never
seen
this
brew
there
i
will
be
on
the
lookout
for
it
next
time
though
it
would
be
a
tasty
alternative
to
san
miguels
other
brews
surprisingly
good
honestly
i
hadnt
expected
much
in
the
way
of
flavor
due
to
the
style
i
really
enjoyed
the
combination
of
smokey
dark
grain
and
sweet
dark
fruit
flavor
is
unified
and
has
enough
depth
of
character
to
be
interesting
i
would
definitely
get
this
again
during
a
brewery
tour
i
was
told
they
had
produced
an
all
malt
product
in
the
past
it
was
discontinued
due
to
cost
malted
barley
is
imported
mostly
from
australia
when
the
average
beer
here
sells
for
about
0
50
usd
you
can
see
where
it
would
be
hard
to
make
an
all
malt
beer
that
would
have
to
sell
at
twice
the
price
given
ghow
disappointing
san
miguel
lager
was
i
was
pleasntly
surprised
by
this
efes
dark
is
a
better
valuie
where
i
live
so
not
sure
when
ill
be
paying
saint
micheal
another
visit
some
roasting
aromas
looks
like
hour
old
coca
cola
some
decent
flavours
in
this
dark
lager
but
a
quite
thin
i
guess
the
hotter
weather
is
made
for
this
one
smooth
but
needs
more
cowbell
there
are
many
better
dark
lagers
out
there
but
who
really
cares
d
very
smooth
i
could
drink
a
bunch
of
these
i
am
sure
it
taste
better
in
the
country
that
it
is
made
in
wasnt
expecting
much
for
a
beer
labeled
dark
lager
but
hey
what
do
i
know
beer
was
dark
with
a
bit
of
tan
head
taste
was
roasty
maltiness
that
wasnt
too
bad
mouth
feel
was
even
better
i
had
two
of
these
the
other
night
at
a
harvest
celebration
a
good
beer
that
is
very
drinkable
drinkability
a
good
sweet
beer
not
what
i
was
expecting
in
a
very
good
way
drinkability
tasty
and
drinkable
good
for
the
style
drinkability
flavorful
but
a
bit
too
sweet
i
will
be
searching
for
this
one
again
i
would
love
to
see
this
on
tap
d
a
good
beer
a
nice
surprise
drinkable
and
at
5
the
type
of
beer
i
would
gladly
have
a
couple
of
definitely
worth
trying
a
very
drinkable
beer
i
love
the
way
this
feels
in
the
mouth
so
smooth
mouth
feel
is
light
and
refreshing
and
i
think
would
be
a
good
pairning
with
mexican
food
or
thaipour
me
another
light
mouthfeelsome
creamyness
and
a
grainy
texture
goes
down
very
smooth
a
good
refreshing
taste
could
session
this
one
reminded
me
of
samuel
smithif
you
like
those
beers
youll
like
this
one
although
its
classified
as
a
euro
dark
lager
its
very
similar
to
a
schwarzbier
its
very
drinkable
however
i
found
that
the
aftertaste
is
a
little
bit
of
a
dissapointment
it
doesnt
ruin
the
beer
but
i
feel
it
shouldnt
be
there
its
definately
worth
a
try
especially
if
its
fresh
a
purply
dark
pour
some
light
peeks
through
at
at
the
edges
and
a
small
white
head
with
high
carbonation
the
smell
arrives
shortly
after
the
bottle
is
opened
a
little
coffee
and
light
malt
the
taste
is
similar
but
is
thinner
than
expected
considering
the
strength
of
the
aroma
the
body
is
simply
too
light
this
one
is
oh
so
close
to
being
a
nice
sessionable
alternative
to
american
lagers
drinkable
but
the
subpar
mouthfeel
and
overall
bubbliness
detract
pours
a
very
dark
mahogany
color
with
a
tall
bubbly
tan
head
that
quickly
fades
into
a
thin
lace
nose
is
sweet
roasted
malts
and
as
another
reviewer
mentioned
saltwater
taffy

taste
is
sweet
malt
along
with
some
molasses
and
dark
buttery
toffee
mildly
bitter
hops
are
present
towards
the
end
the
carbonation
level
seems
a
bit
high
fairly
unremarkable
overall
except
for
the
odd
if
somewhat
interesting
taffylike
aroma
pours
a
dark
ruby
amber
color
with
an
average
head
smell
is
an
average
malty
flavor
and
maybe
some
coffee
tones
taste
is
a
mess
without
any
direction
to
it
just
a
lot
of
roasted
malt
flavors
yes
its
dark
yes
its
a
lager
i
just
wish
there
were
more
here
no
hoppiness
to
speak
of
either
mouthfeel
is
watery
and
thin
the
aftertaste
is
acidic
and
annoying
not
much
body
to
it
i
wouldnt
recommend
this
to
anyone
unless
they
were
stuck
on
an
island
in
the
philippeans
notes
it
was
just
alright
to
me
average
would
sum
it
up
cheers
overall
troublefree
and
uncomplicated
but
far
from
boring
a
social
beer
that
has
an
acceptable
profile
for
lovers
of
dark
lagers
a
reasonable
effort
which
doesnt
disappoint
above
average
overall
a
good
example
of
the
style
a
solid
lager
with
deep
dark
flavors
a
good
yearround
choice
thanks
for
the
phillipine
beer
darren
san
miguel
dark
lager
comes
in
a
twelve
ounce
stubby
i
like
the
retro
look
although
im
not
sure
theyve
ever
changed
their
bottle
it
pours
a
dark
brown
color
as
advertised
with
a
tan
head
ive
got
to
say
the
aroma
is
much
more
interesting
than
i
had
anticipated
it
consists
primarily
of
sweet
malt
nice
sweet
malty
flavor
hops
arent
a
player
in
this
beer
frankly
much
better
than
i
anticpated
definitely
worth
a
try
pours
deep
burgudy
with
mahogany
highlights
and
good
clarity
soapy
dark
tan
head
shows
poor
lacing
and
no
lacing
whatsoever
roasted
barley
with
a
hint
of
coffee
in
the
nose
background
crystal
malt
and
very
faint
fruitiness
the
taste
is
crystal
sweet
with
a
good
roasted
bitterness
and
a
faint
raisin
flavor
semidry
aftertaste
with
very
low
english
hop
profile
the
roasted
character
takes
care
of
the
bitterness
and
the
flavor
is
wellbalanced
the
smooth
light
body
has
medium
carbonation
and
finishes
mellow
with
a
hint
of
licorice
quaffable
with
a
pleasent
sweetroasted
flavor
the
color
is
a
dark
brown
with
a
ruby
glow
aroma
is
of
dark
sweet
malts
with
a
distinct
aroma
of
fresh
dark
bread
taste
is
more
of
the
sweet
dark
malt
with
an
element
of
breadiness
middle
of
the
sip
becomes
more
bittersweet
and
is
reminiscent
of
toffee
or
molasses
the
only
disappointment
here
is
a
weak
abrupt
finish
wow
this
is
surprisingly
very
good
with
plenty
of
flavor
and
enough
complexity
this
gives
most
euro
dark
lagers
a
run
for
their
money
i
did
not
expect
this
good
of
a
beer
from
a
macro
brewery
from
the
philippines
pours
a
dark
mahogany
with
a
finger
or
so
of
offwhite
head
nose
is
a
quirky
mix
of
molasses
caramel
and
bready
malt
taste
is
rather
unique
as
well
gobs
of
molasses
and
caramel
bready
malt
lactose
with
a
hint
of
dark
fruit
and
a
metallic
finish
mouthfeel
is
medium
and
smooth
hard
to
get
a
hold
on
this
one
sweet
milky
bready
metallic
cloying
i
cant
imagine
drinking
too
many
of
these
in
the
humid
tropics
in
the
philippines
theres
a
lot
going
on
but
it
doesnt
quite
mesh
one
and
done
for
me
not
that
i
could
easily
get
ahold
of
more
bottom
line
this
dark
lager
falls
a
little
short
in
flavour
but
its
worth
a
try
overall
avoid
pours
a
deep
brown
into
my
carlsberg
imperial
pint
glass
a
bit
of
bubly
making
its
way
to
the
surface
to
help
form
a
slight
ring
around
the
beer
foam
smells
very
bland
but
promising
of
roasted
malts
to
be
enjoyed
flavor
profile
was
a
little
roasted
and
rye
bredy
but
for
the
most
part
very
country
kitchen
pretty
refreshing
though
something
i
could
drink
all
night
at
a
bar
if
the
price
is
right
plus
the
second
beer
ive
ever
had
from
the
phillipines
and
the
first
one
ive
reviewed
sweet
maltycolalike
aroma
dark
brown
color
with
a
thumb
thick
bubbly
tan
head
fairly
decent
looking
brew
lots
of
raisin
in
the
fore
quite
sweet
some
stewed
prunes
caramel
dates
and
some
mild
roasty
notes
i
think
they
were
obvioulst
going
for
a
schwarzbier
here
and
that
is
mostly
what
it
tastes
like
i
think
it
should
be
classified
as
such
rather
than
as
a
dark
larger
its
a
pretty
tasty
brew
if
you
are
into
schwarzbiers
which
i
am
reminescent
of
an
irish
red
and
a
weaker
german
bock
a
solid
lager
with
toasted
bready
yeasty
malty
and
moderatly
grainy
characteristics
in
the
nose
and
flavor
appears
clear
and
mohogany
ruby
brown
quickly
fading
head
and
little
protein
finsihes
a
bit
sugary
and
again
grain
like
better
than
most
southoftheboarder
beers
but
still
not
my
favorite
the
mouthfeel
was
very
watery
when
i
first
poured
it
but
as
it
warmed
up
it
became
more
substantial
the
pour
is
dark
brown
with
red
hues
and
a
frothy
tan
head
that
fades
into
memory
the
nose
is
roasty
with
sweet
toffee
and
caramel
malts
the
taste
is
right
along
those
lines
burnt
malt
molasses
toffee
caramel
a
dash
of
chocolate
and
a
lactoselike
sweetness
with
a
mild
tangy
hop
finish
mouthfeel
is
a
little
thin
but
highly
carbonated
i
wont
be
rushing
out
to
buy
more
of
this
but
i
wont
pass
it
up
it
if
i
should
ever
see
it
at
a
party
i
used
to
drink
this
stuff
a
lot
during
the
80s
when
i
was
in
the
military
because
they
seemed
to
always
have
great
prices
and
a
good
supply
at
the
onpostonbase
liquor
stores
id
first
tried
the
lighter
version
and
enjoyed
it
both
have
a
bit
of
a
slightly
sweet
taste
not
in
my
interestzone
any
longer
but
it
was
very
enjoyable
i
was
a
bit
shocked
when
i
was
in
spain
recently
to
see
so
many
san
miguel
signs
but
i
then
discovered
that
spain
has
its
own
san
miguel
im
not
sure
if
theyre
connected
or
totally
unrelated
this
is
a
good
overall
dark
beer
fine
with
meals
and
steak
cookouts
etc
pours
a
black
but
when
held
near
light
it
has
a
dark
red
hue
it
has
a
foamy
head
and
is
existent
until
the
end
i
sense
some
sweet
malty
and
scotch
aromas
scotch
is
apparent
in
the
taste
a
and
maybe
a
little
bourbon
too
goes
down
quite
smooth
even
though
it
is
quite
carbonated
has
a
slightly
bitter
aftertaste
this
happens
to
be
a
tasty
fullbodied
brew
and
enjoyed
this
better
than
the
regular
san
miguel
very
nice
flavor
with
a
little
bit
of
a
carmel
taste
and
hints
of
coffee
its
also
not
bitter
in
the
least
all
in
all
one
of
my
favorite
beers
to
drink
both
at
home
and
at
the
pubs
mouthfeel
is
medium
lighter
than
a
stout
but
not
quite
as
light
as
typical
schwartzbiers
finishes
clean
very
robust
holds
my
interest
i
could
session
this
deep
tan
head
settles
over
clear
brownishred
liquid
very
dark
in
appearance
nose
is
heavy
on
earthy
and
sweet
maltiness
hint
of
light
smokiness
some
hints
of
light
chocolate
decent
mouthfeel
taste
is
heavy
on
sweetness
almost
too
much
there
some
more
chocolate
notes
barely
any
hoppiness
to
report
finishes
quite
malty
and
sweet
thats
about
it
not
nearly
as
good
as
i
remember
it
being
years
ago
when
i
last
drank
it
overall
a
good
nonthinking
lager
for
the
summertime
paired
with
some
picnicbbq
appearance
is
awesome
same
with
the
mouthfeel
everything
else
is
just
average
drinkability
much
better
than
what
i
was
expecting
i
could
see
drinking
a
few
of
these
with
a
pizza
hey
now
pretty
nice
find
on
beergeek
solid
dark
lager
pour
was
dark
brown
with
a
smallish
tan
head
minimal
lacing
nice
malt
and
light
chocolate
aroma
and
in
the
taste

which
also
was
tangy
slightly
sweet
typical
dark
lager
low
in
hops
high
in
malts

good
deal
thin
to
medium
bodied
and
carbed

a
good
dark
brew
for
long
haul
drinking
5
small

middle
bursting
with

a
tangy

finish
more
caramel

a
little
bitter
not
bad
fairly
flavorful
the
beer
pours
a
translucent
dark
brown
color
with
a
14
tan
head
that
fades
to
lacing
the
aroma
is
good
it
has
a
nice
malty
scent
that
boasts
of
pale
and
crystal
malts
with
a
creamy
yet
slightly
dry
lager
yeast
aroma
it
is
sweet
with
caramel
malts
the
taste
is
decent
it
has
a
very
sweet
crystal
malt
flavor
that
is
a
little
bland
and
dry
on
the
finish
it
has
a
nice
roasted
quality
to
it
the
mouthfeel
is
fine
it
is
a
medium
bodied
beer
with
adequategood
carbonation
this
is
a
decent
dark
lager
it
has
good
aroma
and
decent
flavor
its
not
the
best
ive
had
but
i
would
drink
it
again
if
it
was
in
the
fridge
overall
impression
this
one
started
strong
and
faded
its
not
offensive
and
shows
glimmers
of
greatness
but
it
just
cant
go
the
distance
for
a
lager
its
rather
interesting
and
enjoyable
im
not
driven
to
a
session
but
im
not
against
another
either
im
waffling
like
a
belgian
on
this
one
not
bad
not
great
worth
a
try
dont
kill
yourself
looking
presentation
packaged
in
a
custom
twelve
ounce
brown
glass
bottle
with
a
pryoff
crown
served
in
a
standard
pint
tap
glass
overall
the
aroma
is
worth
the
go
around
but
the
taste
just
did
not
hit
the
spot
and
thats
the
most
important
part
edit
so
after
reviewing
i
noticed
it
was
euro
dark
lager
not
the
style
i
expected
perhaps
this
is
more
to
its
style
then
i
let
on
i
beleive
this
is
the
first
of
this
style
i
have
ahd
so
perhaps
it
is
my
lack
of
knowledge
not
the
beers
lack
of
personality
still
say
skip
it
tastes
moderately
sweet
and
raisin
no
bready
malty
backbone
to
this
one
the
mouthfeel
is
much
thicker
than
i
expected
really
its
a
thick
beer
but
dont
expect
a
stout
theres
no
roasted
maltcoffeechocolate
flavors
here
the
flavor
just
kind
of
drops
off
a
cliff
this
beer
pours
out
dark
brown
with
some
ruby
highlights
has
a
nice
light
brown
head
there
is
a
strong
malty
aroma
with
serious
molasses
overtones
and
a
coffee
background
the
flavor
is
very
sweet
at
first
but
disappears
quickly
with
a
hint
of
coffee
bitterness
on
the
finish
has
a
very
watery
mouthfeel
i
shuddered
when
i
picked
this
bottle
up
the
name
brought
back
bad
memories
from
when
i
was
in
viet
nam
in
68
san
miguel
is
one
of
the
few
beers
that
we
could
get
and
most
of
the
time
had
to
drink
in
warm
it
was
one
of
the
worst
beers
over
there
and
it
was
not
dark
lager
so
i
thought
i
would
give
this
1
a
go

weak
could
hardly
pull
anything
out
faint
hints
of
chocolate
toffee
and
some
cherry
but
had
to
let
it
stay
in
my
mouth
for
a
while
watery
it
wasnt
as
bad
as
i
thought
it
was
going
to
be
san
miguel
dark
lager
is
a
much
better
beer
than
is
san
miguel
premium
lager
its
better
than
decent
solo
and
would
probably
go
well
with
a
wide
variety
of
foods
now
if
i
could
only
find
a
filipino
restaurant

the

off
sour

leathery

of
a

the
taste

semi
malty
some

notes
are
evident
light
almost
watery

overall
this
is
a
smooth
easy
to
drink
lager
that
has
an
interesting
and
satisfying
roasted
character
about
it
not
much
depth
to
it
but
enjoyable
this
beer
poured
very
dark
and
with
barely
any
head
to
speak
of
nose
was
somewhat
abrasive
sweet
caramel
malts
taste
matched
the
smell
sweet
with

it
reminded
me
of
some
sort
of
weak
version
of
coke
faint
hop
dryness
creamy
in
the
mouth
and
low

i
think
helped
this

to
be
a
little

drinkable
for
me
poured
from

330

no

a
quick
fizzle

almost
looks

poured
a

it
gets
that
cherry
red

appearance
when
held
up
to

light
right
off
the
start
i
pick
up
dried
date
and
fig
aromas
on
the
nose
while
a
sort
of
sweet
malty
molasses
shows
up
after
that
and
then
notes
of
black
current
as
well
curious
im
not
sure
if
the
flavour
has
decided
upon
where
it
wants
to
stand
i
have
the
dried
fruit
toasted
malt
and
molasses
kind
of
thrown
at
me
all
at
once
however
its
not
a
very
strong
throw
it
falls
a
bit
short
due
to
the
watery
mouthfeel
which
also
affects
the
strength
of
the
flavour
as
well
which
is
rather
weak
no
sir
im
not
impressed
with
this
at
all
however
to
end
on
a
positive
note
how
about
3
cheers
for
uberstubbies
not
a
bad
beer
notes
the
smell
pumps
you
up
and
the
taste
brings
you
back
down
its
not
bad
and
it
has
its
strong
points
but
lacks
in
the
most
important
which
is
taste
just
a
little
too
watery
and
thin
mabuhay
this
was
a
real
surprising
beer
from
san
miguel
after
the
experiences
drinking
san
miguels
not
the
dark
lager
in
the
p
i
back
in
the
day
i
wasnt
too
sure
id
be
getting
anything
very
good
with
this
one
this
is
one
easydrinking
brew
and
worth
picking
up
if
you
see
it
on
the
shelf
tasty
drinkable
brew
almost
could
be
a
bock
beer
the
beer
disembogues
the
bottle
a
deep
sanguineous
color
the
head
bunyanesque
in
size
and
a
light
brown
color
the
texture
is
frothy

the

a
thick
and
clinging

is
sweet

is
lightly
sweet
nicely
malted
top
a
bit
thin
finish
is
mild
in
its
acidity
the
hops
mild
and
pleasing
to
the
palate
aftertaste
very
dry
and
longlasting
drinkable
but
a
much
better
beer
on
july
4
1962
when
i
pulled
my
first
liberty
in
subic
bay
philippines
and
sampled
my
first
foreign
beer
geez
that
more
than
40
years
ago
time
sure
flies
when
youre
having
fun
begins
with
a
creamy
but
receding
beige
head
with
an
average
amount
of
lace
the
aroma
is
a
surprisingly
interesting
mixture
of
roasted
coffee
chocolate
or
mollasses
and
even
a
hint
of
raisins
there
is
a
sourness
and
bitterness
to
this
beer
initally
it
has
a
stoutlike
flavour
and
there
is
a
suggestion
of
soapiness
you
can
taste
the
alcohol
in
the
finish
on
the
palate
san

dark
is
softly
carbonated
dry

notes
middling
dark
lager
this
is
a
nice
beer
from
the
philippines
i
must
say
perhaps
a
bit
one
dimensional
due
to
the
malt
being
the
focal
point
but
it
is
quite
easy
to
drink
and
i
can
imagine
having
this
with
some
dark
poultry
like
duck
for
instance
it
isnt
a
grounbreaking
beer
in
anyway
but
is
a
good
old
easy
to
drink
dark
lager
poured
a
dark
brownish
color
sweet
malt
aroma
on
the
first
sniff
first
taste
was
surprisingly
great
i
was
hit
by
a
blast
of
sweet
chocolate
roastedness
which
leveled
out
as
the
glass
went
down
but
i
savored
it
to
the
end
tasty
refreshing
all
a
beer
should
be
it
reminded
me
of
xingu
but
i
thought
this
was
better
dark
brown
color
large
head
aroma
is
roasted
malts
dark
roasted
malts
slightly
sweet
hops
are
subdued
mild
taste
and
flavor
well
balanced
but
a
little
thin
tasting
not
a
bad
beer
but
nothing
special
better
than
i
expected
mouthfeel
is
full
and
round
finish
is
clean
and
smooth
aftertaste
is
slightly
sweet
drinkability

this
goes
great
with
cotton
candy
giant
swirly
lollipops
and
pier
fries
a
clear
very
deep
mahogany
body
rests
beneath
a
creamy
head
of
light
tan
foam
that
slowly
receeds
to
a
solid
collar
and
leaves
some
very
nice
transient
lace
the
nose
offers
a
sweetish
toffee
malt
thats
clean
and
welcoming
its
smooth
and
creamy
across
the
palate
with
a
medium
body
and
delicate
somewhat
restrained
carbonation
the
flavor
delivers
a
mild
fruity
note
and
a
dollop
of
gentle
sweet
buttery
caramel
thats
just
enough
to
keep
it
interesting
the
underlying
bitterness
balances
very
nicely
in
the
mouth
and
emerges
a
bit
in
a
shortlived
finish
that
expresses
some
light
nuttiness
a
wellbrewed
beer
with
some
interesting
character
very
nice
this
is
a
very
nice
dunkel
from
the
phillipines
it
pours
a
very
dark
amber
with
some
retention
in
the
cream
colored
head
a
small
level
of
lace
was
observed
through
most
of
the
glass
a
very
nice
nose
gives
a
bit
of
floral
and
caramel
malt
sense
and
the
flavor
is
sweet
but
not
over
the
top
as
with
many
heavy
dunkels
there
apears
to
be
only
a
moderate
abv
for
this
beer
though
none
is
listed
overall
this
is
a
nicely
drinkable
dunkel
at
moderate
price
levels
taste
im
not
that
familiar
with
dark
lagers
i
really
felt
like
this
tasted
like
an
unfinished
beer
if
that
makes
any
sense
there
is
a
slightly
hoppy
taste
to
it
but
im
left
considering
the
dark
color
expecting
a
richness
that
just
wasnt
there
rings
rather
hollow
like
a
can
of
dr
pepper
left
out
overnight
well
i
heard
good
things
about
this
one
but
i
didnt
think
to
highly
of
it
not
as
dark
as
i
thought
it
would
be
almost
a
chesnut
brown
colordid
have
a
nice
head
wich
stayed
for
awhile
smell
was
spiceyand
malty
the
flavor
was
a
little
dry
for
me
i
was
hoping
it
would
be
a
little
sweeterreal
light
texture
wich
made
kind
easy
to
drink
but
didnt
feel
great
in
the
mouth
nothing
to
write
home
about
but
okay
clear
dark
brown
with
a
nice
big
and
cottony
head
very
caramel
aroma
malty
to
be
sure
nice
chocolate
and
toffee
early
flavor
minimal
hops
but
the
early
flavor
is
taken
to
the
close
by
a
mediumbodied
mouthfeel
slight
sense
of
papery
notes
but
not
pronounced
not
a
huge
impression
but
unexpectedly
good
tasty
and
drinkable
one
of
the
best
darker
lagers
ive
had
from
an
equatorial
country
i
dont
know
about
this
one
it
looks
a
hell
of
a
lot
better
than
the
regular
san
miguel
but
in
the
end
there
was
nothing
happening
very
thin
body
watery
texture
quite
sweet
and
very
bland
cerveza
negra
is
the
taste
of
a
robust
spirit
full
of
flavor
with
caramel
tones
that
tease
the
palate
when
poured
it
is
rich
and
creamy
a
surprising
favorite
of
mine
from
the
philippines
just
imbibed
two
pints
at
a
calgary
pub
near
work
another
big
rock
brew
that
has
been
around
for
a
long
time
and
ive
probably
had
it
numerous
times
previously
without
caring
too
much
about
what
i
was
drinking
this
is
classified
as
a
euro
dark
lager
here
sure
i
guess
it
does
have
some
old
world
character
and
theres
a
dearth
of
obvious
american
hop
flavors
a
coppery
reddish
brown
beer
with
minimal
beige
foam
one
that
smells
vaguely
like
brown
sugar
and
cereal
bowl
malts
with
a
hint
of
grassy
hops
overall
a
pretty
subdued
aroma
tastes
malty
and
sweet
as
well
theres
a
sweetness
that
one
might
as
well
describe
as
honey
coupled
with
sweet
dough
not
sure
if
this
actually
contains
said
honey
could
be
more
of
a
light
brown
sugar
effect
though
theres
a
similarly
light
nuttiness
hints
of
cherry
bubblegum
and
some
dry
cardboard
and
semiearthy
hops
in
the
finish
thin
and
fizzy
like
a
standard
macrolager
nothing
too
terrible
but
whats
there
is
largely
forgettable
this
is
what
big
rock
used
to
represent
and
still
backslides
into
at
times
d
pretty
much
a
runofthemill
brew
for
local
big
rock
a
marginal
improvement
over
usual
macrolagers
but
doesnt
hold
a
candle
to
true
craft
this
brewery
is
really
only
good
as
a
gateway
to
bigger
better
things
in
the
world
of
beer
problem
is
some
people
get
stuck
here
and
never
find
their
way
to
the
vast
world
of
craft
beer
a
decent
brew
but
ill
pass
next
time
simple
stuff
brewed
for
the
masses
theres
nothing
wrong
with
it
but
not
something
id
bother
with
again
drinkability
quite
drinkable
due
to
its
lightness
i
do
not
recommend
drinking
this
with
food
as
the
food
will
surely
overpower
the
beer
flavoring
d
went
down
smoothly
id
drink
more
d
drinkable
yes
but
quite
bland
d
i
must
say
ive
found
big
rock
beers
to
be
rather
plain
but
was
taken
aback
by
the
sweet
honey
flavour
in
this
one
definitely
impressed
and
would
actually
order
this
one
over
their
other
offerings
the
next
time
im
at
a
pub
i
have
yet
to
come
across
a
fantastic
honey
lager
but
this
one
beats
the
bunch
ive
had
the
honey
is
natural
in
the
taste
sweet
but
not
cloyingly
so
overall
this
is
a
very
simple
and
sweet
thirst
quenching
lager
average
at
best
but
a
good
alternative
to
the
standard
macro
i
would
highly
recommend
this
beer
its
a
very
nice
smooth
brown
lager
lightbodied
with
low
carbonation
and
a
slightly
syrupy
mouthfeel
this
a
simple
decent
easy
drinking
lager
if
that
honeyed
sweetness
isnt
too
much
for
you
i
like
it
but
dont
think
i
would
want
to
have
more
than
one
or
two
two
fingers
of
ecru
head
with
solid
retention
color
was
a
rich
deep
amber
with
nequality
clarity
nose
was
sweet
but
not
just
lager
sweet
enhanced
with
a
honey
scent
mouthfeel
was
medium
with
a
nice
smooth
taste
of
sweet
honey
finish
had
a
nice
smooth
sweetness
drinkability
really
not
something
i
would
seek
out
there
are
better
examples
of
the
style
that
arent
so
overbearing
and
much
cheaper
final
thoughts
as
a
fan
of
sleeman
honey
brown
i
thought
this
offering
might
be
somewhat
comparable
but
sadly
it
falls
a
little
bit
flat
i
would
certainly
drink
it
again
if
offered
but
i
would
not
go
out
of
my
way
for
this
beer
the
bottles
gone
fairly
quickly
so
its
not
a
pain
to
drink
but
not
one
i
will
seek
out
not
quite
balanced
in
taste
or
mouthfeel
this
is
a
mediocre
offering
not
enough
character
to
be
really
likeable
and
not
enough
to
demand
one
more
drink
either
my
strangely
affectionate
history
with
this
brewer
coupled
with
this
brews
overall
temperateness
makes
for
an
easy
if
not
at
all
complex
hot
tub
sipper
as
far
as
the
hotel
management
was
concerned
it
was
honey
brown
cola
all
right
pours
a
clear
and
dark
amber
and
topped
with
a
quickly
disappearing
bone
white
head
leaving
little
lacing
smell
is
bland
maybe
a
crack
of
honey
but
otherwise
phenolic
and
green
apple
like
in
both
taste
and
aroma
with
only
the
slightest
hint
of
honey
taste
i
wouldnt
really
classify
this
as
a
dunkel
lager
as
its
not
even
that
dark
and
has
no
real
qualities
of
a
dunkel
lager
not
really
sure
where
this
beer
fits
in
but
is
not
a
beer
i
would
seek
out
or
drink
again
for
any
real
reason
the
beer
looks
better
than
it
tastes
there
is
a
sweet
caramel
note
to
this
brew
that
decreases
its
drinkability
in
fact
the
finish
is
too
cloying
considering
this
beer
should
be
easydrinking
pass
on
this
offering
from
big
rock
and
get
the
much
better
trad
ale
instead
this
one
has
a
nice
copper
orangey
color
with
a
good
size
white
bubbly
head
and
leaves
very
mild
lacing
the
nose
is
sweet
honey
and
mollases
and
some
fruity
aroma
in
there
too
taste
is
a
little
too
sweet
for
my
likingdefinetly
honey
in
there
and
comes
at
you
with
a
dryness
to
itkinda
tastes
like
orange
marmalademedium
body
with
some
mild
carbsnot
a
bad
beer
i
guess
if
you
like
it
sweet1
is
good
enough
for
me
this
poured
copper
with
a
creamy
head
that
dwindled
to
a
thin
ring
not
much
to
smell
other
than
some
floralclover
sweetness
and
honey
the
taste
is
slightly
sweet
with
honey
and
additional
molasses
no
detectable
hops
the
mouthfeel
seems
right
for
the
style
but
theres
not
much
to
recommend
here
beyond
saying
its
not
a
bad
beer
if
youre
offered
one
this
one
doesnt
do
it
for
me
besides
looking
at
it
nothing
is
very
pleasant
here
poured
as
agressively
as
possbile
and
still
managed
only
1
finger
of
head
some
lacing
stuck
around
nice
copper
colored
look
to
this
beer
smelt
of
malt
and
sweet
flowers
very
sweet
would
be
the
initial
impression
followed
by
a
hint
of
chocolate
malt
and
a
hint
of
euro
mineral
water
kind
of
watery
and
too
sweet
compared
to
what
is
out
there
overall
the
beer
is
sweet
though
not
fruity
sweet
but
a
cloying
feeling
in
the
mouth
it
look
pretty
in
the
classclear
golden
and
crisp
with
a
white
fluffy
head
the
maintains
good
retention
but
the
aroma
signaled
where
it
went
down
hillvery
light
aroma
no
hop
and
the
smell
thats
present
is
somewhat
medicinal
the
taste
has
caramel
notes
with
a
little
nutty
flavor
but
hard
to
tell
very
watery
with
little
mouthfeel
just
not
much
there
maybe
a
lawnmower
beer
if
its
the
only
thing
offered
otherwise
go
another
direction
pours
a
clear
brownred
with
orange
highlights
big
white
head
some
nice
lacing
on
the
glass
smell
is
sweet
honey
and
molasses
citrus
and
floral
taste
is
sweet
and
honeymolasses
with
some
grains
and
citrus
mouthfeel
is
light
bodied
with
medium
carbonation
not
a
bad
beer
smell
is
of
bready
malts
with
caramel
and
toffee
notes
not
too
bad
taste
is
less
impressive
a
bit
too
sweet
for
my
taste
cavity
inducing
almost
bready
but
not
much
bite
to
speak
of
soft
and
smooth
in
the
mouth
but
and
slides
down
pretty
easily
like
i
said
a
bit
too
sweet
for
my
taste
it
makes
my
teeth
hurt
after
a
couple
which
could
make
it
hard
to
make
this
one
a
session
beer
i
wasnt
impressed
with
this
one
at
all
light
brown
in
colour
with
hints
of
gold
fairly
carbonated
with
some
earthy
hop
presence
i
hardly
got
any
honey
flavor
at
all
but
i
did
get
an
unpleasant
bitter
chemical
flavor
not
much
body
either
quite
watery
if
you
want
a
honey
beer
do
yourself
a
favor
avoid
this
one
and
try
fullers
organic
honeydew
if
you
can
find
it
even
sleemans
honey
brown
is
better
than
this
one
this
would
actually
be
a
really
good
beer
if
it
wasnt
for
the
aftertaste
just
kills
everything
all
the
big
rock
beers
i
have
tried
have
this
same
unpleasant
aftertaste
if
this
could
be
changed
they
all
would
be
alot
better
id
be
willing
to
give
this
a
try
again
in
the
future
to
see
if
it
was
just
the
case
i
bought
but
i
wont
be
hunting
any
down
anytime
soon
not
recommened
d
very
light
tart
beer
with
not
much
hops
to
balance
the
tartness
it
is
missing
any
sort
of
malt
depth
that
i
would
accept
from
this
style
deep
bronze
in
color
small
but
lasting
head
of
dense
foam
that
leaves
some
lacing
smell
of
grain
and
alberta
clover
honey
gives
a
floral
aroma
taste
is
sweet
at
the
start
but
has
some
hop
to
balance
very
well
rounded
finishes
with
a
controlled
bitterness
i
found
it
a
bit
sweeter
than
other
honeybrowns
my
favourite
compared
to
sleeman
and
rickards
pours
an
amber
color
with
a
solid
rocky
head
and
some
decent
lacing
the
aroma
is
mostly
of
honey
sweetness
with
some
soft
fruitiness
taste
is
of
strong
honey
with
some
floral
hop
notes
and
not
much
malt
complexity
this
has
more
honey
taste
than
any
beer
ive
tried
before
its
almost
too
sweet
to
be
drinkable
but
theres
just
enough
hoppiness
to
make
the
finish
palatable
very
watery
mouthfeel
i
dont
think
ill
buy
it
again
but
its
not
terrible
the
flavour
is
lightly
malty
with
the
grainy
toasty
finish
and
a
bit
of
honey
bite
i
think
the
honey
must
be
giving
it
a
lightly
acidic
character
which
is
actually
quite
refreshing
that
brightness
keeps
the
mouthfeel
light
and
overall
its
very
easy
drinking
a
clear
amberishorangey
looking
beverage
it
pours
out
with
a
healthy
frothy
white
head
which
recedes
to
a
decent
ring
and
leaves
a
fair
amount
of
lacing
the
nose
is
sweet
flowery
malt
akin
to
a
spring
meadow
which
always
takes
me
to
a
wonderful
place
however
regarding
the
flavour
any
present
malt
sinks
immediately
into
the
rich
sweet
taste
of
fermented
clover
honey
no
roasted
malt
character
to
be
detected
at
all
which
is
what
i
usually
crave
in
a
brown
of
any
kind
far
too
sweet
to
drink
more
than
one
of
in
any
sitting
this
is
bordering
along
mead
sweetness
ill
stick
to
grasshopper
for
now
as
my
regular
at
4
5
abv
this
would
be
my
session
beer
of
choice
if
only
it
was
available
at
local
liquor
stores
in
something
other
than
a
mixed
pack
overall
i
like
it
a
good
dark
beer
id
probably
buy
this
again
to
have
as
an
option
among
other
beers
at
a
party
overall
3
755
this
is
alright
see
it
more
of
as
a
staple
dark
in
that
its
very
drinkable
without
a
very
aggressive
flavour
character
tasty
for
sure
and
very
drinkable
o
tasty
ale
glad
to
have
tried
it
wish
the
lcbo
was
more
consistent
in
town
with
getting
the
ocb
mixers
an
easy
drinking
dark
ale
deep
chestnut
brown
colour
ruby
highlights
show
when
held
to
light
topped
by
two
fingers
of
tan
head
fair
retention
and
good
lace
mute
aroma
toasted
bread
and
light
coffee
notes
a
hint
of
burnt
sugar
pleasant
but
quite
weak
malt
forward
burnt
toast
and
black
coffee
flavour
lightly
sweet
finishes
clean
aside
from
some
light
char
that
lingers
in
the
back
of
the
mouth
lightbodied
with
low
carbonation
thin
but
not
quite
watery
a
little
slight
on
character
but
whats
there
tastes
decent
drinkability
its
a
very
smooth
drinkable
beer
accompanied
with
decent
flavors
and
aromas
smooth
mild
and
easy
to
throw
back
this
is
a
serviceable
fairly
enjoyable
example
of
a
beer
style
that
i
often
find
either
bland
or
cloying
potentially
very
sessionable
if
you
are
in
the
mood
for
something
dark
but
not
complex
enough
to
satisfy
serious
beer
geeks
i
could
definitely
see
myself
getting
this
again
if
i
found
it
ontap
somewhere
o
a
drinkable
brew
that
is
not
quite
balanced
could
be
i
do
not
like
the
style
which
i
have
only
tried
once
before
with
a
similar
result
od
not
bad
but
it
could
be
improved
upon
its
got
too
much
cola
and
burnt
coffee
needs
improvement
but
its
alright
m
very
light
body
and
taste
the
mouth
feel
is
too
simple
all
the
goodness
of
the
coffee
like
aroma
and
tasting
is
lost
with
the
missing
malts
or
other
flavors
not
bad
but
seems
to
be
missing
something
either
punch
or
body
im
not
sure
saved
it
for
last
but
probably
my
least
favourite
of
the
4pack
sampler
of
the
four
that
come
in
the
mixed
pack
i
would
have
to
say
this
is
the
weakest
theres
just
not
a
lot
that
interests
me
in
the
taste
certainly
worth
a
try
as
this
is
by
no
means
a
bad
effort
indeed
as
i
can
see
from
my
review
not
bad
as
a
descriptor
keeps
coming
up
it
just
needs
some
work
to
stand
out
among
the
other
efforts
featured
in
this
dark
ale
heavy
province
final
thoughts
camerons
has
always
struck
me
as
a
gateway
brewery
they
dont
quite
brew
stuff
that
appeals
to
the
beer
connoisseur
but
they
are
certainly
not
the
kind
of
brewery
who
brews
macro
swill
to
get
by
this
beer
is
no
exception
and
is
really
the
kind
of
beverage
to
ween
someone
off
adjunct
lager
syndrome
and
into
more
flavourful
beer
drinking
drinkability
i
found
this
to
be
a
very
blah
beer
in
the
end
there
was
a
bit
of
a
higher
expectations
in
the
end
i
would
not
go
after
this
beer
drink
a
nice
drinkable
beer
would
be
pretty
decent
as
a
session
beer
for
the
dark
beer
fans
im
interested
in
trying
the
other
varietys
in
camerons
lineup
pours
a
dark
reddishbrown
but
not
quite
opaque
colour
with
light
tan

some
spotty
lacing
down
the
glass
i
can
smell
some
hops
with
the
dark
chocolate
malt
flavour
has
a
mild
bitterness
but
it
wasnt
too
much
to
overpower
the
sweetness
of
the
beer
quite
sweet
overall
maybe
a
bit
too
much
body
is
a
little
bit
thin
but
carbonation
was
nice
easy
to
drink
and
have
pitchers
of
but
not
something
to
seek
out
a
decent
dark
lager
that
would
make
a
good

ultimately
a

d
very
disappointing
beer
it
was
bland
and
almost
completely
lacked
flavour
for
me
after
seeing
the
dark
brown
pour
in
to
my
glass
i
had
higher
expectations
and
this
missed
those
expectations
without
a
doubt
wont
be
buying
this
again
people
who
like
this
little
flavour
and
character
in
their
beers
are
not
the
ones
likely
drink
a
beer
with
dark
in
its
name
colour
aside
this
has
no
difference
from
most
conventional
pale
ales
or
lagers
it
has
no
more
sweetness
roast
bitterness
or
body
the
brewery
claims
that
it
took
266
batches
to
get
the
recipe
right
i
suggest
they
try
a
few
more
light
but
not
too
thin
the
wateriness
in
the
nose
does
not
come
through
in
the
body
a
good
alternative
to
macro
lagers
a
standard
canadian
microbrewed
dark
ale
with
maybe
a
bit
more
complexity
than
is
the
norm
but
still
nothing
to
get
all
that
excited
about
now
on
to
the
more
vaunted
wine
pairings
for
the
evening
bring
it
on
reds
yawn
thought
i
was
going
to
get
this
nice
beefy
dark
styled
beer
but
was
left
thinking
where
is
the
umpff
all
in
all
very
drinkable
and
would
be
a
great
dark
beer
for
someone
who
doesnt
drink
a
whole
lot
of
beer
especially
dark
although
the
colour
is
nice
dont
let
it
fool
you
all
in
all
a
decent
beer
but
i
was
hoping
for
a
nice
dark
roasted
malt
bitter
finish
well
i
guess
i
will
just
have
to
try
all
the
camerons
beers
to
find
one
i
like
kinda
plain
and
disappointing
although
im
sure
it
would
be
a
decent
stepping
stone
beer
as
theres
more
going
on
in
here
than
in
some
of
the
more
commercially
available
beers
the
vote
is
still
out
on
camerons
one
good
one
bad
overall
a
good
dark
lager
final
statement
no
comment
certainly
a
well
crafted
canadian
dunkel
with
a
unique
character
which
i
enjoy
smooth
flavorful
satisfying
certainly
this
brewers
best
offering
and
the
second
best
dunkel
on
the
ontario
market
hope
they
make
this
a
mainstay
brand
i
found
this
to
be
an
excellent
beer
definitely
will
have
again

can

there
was
something
about
the

came

a

on

overall
a
decent
quaff
that
is
worthy
of
repeating
o
okay
really
better
than
i
was
expecting
but
still
cheap
tasting
and
syrupy
this
the
most
balanced
of
the
baltikas
likely
the
best
one
along
with
number
6
but
it
is
good
not
great
if
you
like
caramel
beers
this
may
be
your
choice
the
sweetness
is
prevalent
in
the
flavor
at
first
with
a
quick
hint
of
low
bitterness
at
the
end
it
seems
to
fit
into
the
style
well
enough
but
there
is
nothing
extraordinary
about
it
easy
to
drink
though
i
think
this
is
a
very
middle
of
the
pack
output
from
baltika
the
color
looked
great
inviting
progressing
from
a
dark
brown
to
dark
yellow
there
was
a
hint
of
sweetness
to
the
smell
that
wasnt
supported
by
the
taste
the
finish
reminded
me
of
caramel
both
in
taste
in
sucking
it
off
the
sides
of
my
mouth
i
think
in
the
future
ill
stick
with
6
if
i
can
but
this
wouldnt
be
the
worst

i
just
have
two
things
in
mind
when
i
drink
it
if
it
is
best
suited
for
after
dinner
or
after
dessert
that
is
the
question
salud
this
pours
a
dark
amber
color
with
a
fluffy
beige
head
the
scent
is
mainly
malts
with
some
yeast
present
the
taste
is
sweet
and
malty
to
begin
with
and
finishes
with
a
toasted
malted
after
taste
leaves
a
decent
lacing
around
the
glass
and
drinks
rather
smoothly
a
pretty
decent
dark
lager
from
russia
the
color
when
poured
into
a
glass
was
a
medium
dark
golden
brown
with
a
reddish
hue
there
was
no
foam
or
lace
what
so
ever
the
smell
of
roasted
malts
caramel
and
molasses
was
very
evident
in
the
aroma
of
this
dark
larger
i
could
taste
the
roasted
malts
but
also
it
had
a
flavor
reminding
me
of
i
hate
to
say
this
but
alfalfa
it
had
a
grassy
aftertaste
there
is
also
a
taste
of
sweet
caramel
and
molasses
on
the
aftertaste
along
with
the
alfalfa
if
not
for
the
grassy
taste
this
would
be
a
lot
better
dark
lager
i
have
never
been
to
russia
but
i
love
the
name
and
i
love
the
culture
what
i
know
of
it
anyway
i
know
when
i
was
in
poland
they
drank
more
vodka
than
we
do
water
maybe
in
russia
they
drink
more
baltika
than
water
if
i
lived
there
i
know
i
would
poured
this
euro
dark
lager
from
a
bottle
into
a
pint
glass
poured
a
hazy
amber
color
produced
a
small
cream
colored
head
poor
retention
and
left
little
lacing
on
the
glass
the
aroma
of
this
lager
consisted
of
sweet
candy
syrup
and
caramel
the
foundation
of
this
brew
consisted
of
sweet
cereal
grains
caramel
grapes
and
some
spicy
hops
the
balance
of
this
brew
was
off
it
was
way
to
sweet
unlike
any
euro
lager
i
have
had
decent
session
beer
if
your
looking
for
something
different
but
not
something
that
i
would
go
back
to
if
there
are
other
options
o
this
is
actually
pretty
drinkable
and
alongside
some
complexity
this
beer
is
far
from
a
waste
of
this
brewerys
beers
i
find
this
to
be
on
the
high
end
not
bad
for
the
2
price
tag
atmosphere
is
okay
decent
appearance
although
no
lacing
nose
is
simple
combo
of
malt
and
hefty
infusion
of
molasses
flavor
is
malty
with
the
a
slight
sweet
tinge
but
seems
a
little
a
shallow
and
washedout
overall
this
is
a
decent
quaff
overall
its
okay
lacks
a
decent
balance
probably
wouldnt
buy
again
murky
and
unpleasant
but
a
lovely
sudsy
brew
label
says

so
this
stuff
is
a
year
and
a
half
old
thank
you
bevmo
for
dusting
the
bottles
so
no
one
notices
that
might
explain
the
uninspiring
taste
ill
check
the
dates
next
time
taste
is
like
the
smell
its
earthy
its
malty
its
pungent
not
a
lot
of
hops
its
got
a
dark
fruit
flavour
to
it
and
it
tastes
old
not
surprising
since
it
was
brewed
9
months
ago
and
is
a
lager
it
says
its
good
for
a
year
though
its
by
no
means
a
complex
beer
but
its
by
no
means
bad
either
i
probably
wont
buy
it
again
since
i
liked
the
9
a
lot
better
and
it
is
the
same
price
actually
i
will
probably
buy
another
one
if
it
is
noticeably
fresher
this
one
has
a
staleness
to
it
that
might
not
be
there
if
it
were
on
the
fresher
side
za
vas
food
match
what
goes
with
pumpernickel
tasting
beers
pumpernickel
for
the
uninitiated
pumpernickel
is
a
dark
rye
bread
that
is
as
dense
as
a
black
hole
just
as
dark
and
a
little
sour
o
this
beer
seems
to
be
a
bit
sweet
and
lacks
any
complexity
in
the
taste
o
this
is
not
a
great
beer
and
that
is
unfortunate
because
baltika
makes
some
decent
beers
i
am
unlikely
to
buy
this
beer
again
the
best
part
of
this
beer
is
the
appearance
out
of
a
bottle
this
beer
was
a
clear
copper
color
with
a
nice
amount
of
rising
carbonation
the
offwhite
head
retained
itself
rather
well
and
laced
as
a
sliding
curtain
the
aroma
was
of
bread
malt
a
little
brown
sugar
caramel
malt
some
nuts
and
a
hint
of
hops
the
flavors
were
appealing
and
i
can
see
why
this
became
their
flagship
beer
i
tasted
caramel
malt
toasted
malt
sweet
malt
it
was
a
sweet
beer
in
general
some
bread
a
little
butter
and
booze
on
the
finish

fool
you
this
is
a
smooth
beer
for
sessions
or
light
meals
a
bit
pricey
for
casual
drinking
but
if
you
are
feeling
adventurous
baltikas
are
never
in
the
bad
category
and
like
this
one
are
usually
quite
good
for
a
country
known
for
its
vodkas
they
make
a
damn
fine
beer
because
of
its
sweetness
it
is
a
terrific
beer
to
give
someone
who
thinks
that
all
dark
beers
taste
of
charcoal
overall
this
is
really
a
sugar
bomb
drinkability
suffers
as
a
result
and
really
the
actual
flavors
just
arent
that
good
t
light

same

little
bittternes
at
the

very
simple

butand
it
is
worth
buying
one
of
the
better
dark
lagers
that
i
have
tasted
my
pour
produced
over
two
fingers
worth
of
fizzing
mochacolored
head
with
surprisingly
decent
retention
underneath
the
head
was
a
glass
of
burnt
orangishamber
beer
with
neplus
quality

bupgoo
bringing
the
glass
up
to
my
sniffer
it
evinced
a
nutty
chocolaty
odor
and
i
was
primed
mouthfeel
was
medium
and
it
had
a
grainy
nutty
chocolaty
taste
in
my
mouth
like
a
chocolatecovered
granola
bar
boy
howdy
after
having
sifted
through
can
after
can
of
aals
this
was
a
welcome
change
of
pace
i
have
never
felt
ripped
off
after
drinking
a
baltika
beer
even
if
it
was
not
all
that
great
given
their
relatively
low
price
point
finish
continued
with
that
same
nutty
chocolate
flavor
and
i
found
myself
wishing
that
i
had
another
bottle
good
stuff
this
brew
poured
out
as
a
decent
looking
brown
color
the
head
was
pretty
good
looking
at
first
but
disappeared
within
a
few
minutes
the
smell
of
the
beer
had
some
typical
lager
earthy
notes
to
it
with
a
slight
roasted
sweetness
the
taste
of
the
beer
had
some
caramel
elements
to
it
along
with
some
roasted
nuts
and
grassy
earth
flavors
the
first
sip
wasnt
that
good
to
me
but
as
i
drank
the
beer
it
got
better
the
mouthfeel
was
decent
had
a
medium
body
and
carbonation
overall
this
brew
wasnt
too
bad
but
i
wasnt
blown
away
by
it
either
it
was
ok
i
might
drink
it
again
depending
on
the
situation
appearance
is
a
dark
ruby
amber
having
a
thin
stiff
head
that
dissipates
to
a
thin
film
smell
of
rich
malt
molassas
and
darker
fruits
taste
follows
the
nose
having
a
mild
hop
note
that
finishes
clean
mouthfeel
is
medium
a
little
viscous
with
good
carbonation
overall
a
very
enjoyable
dark
lager
o
besides
the
slightly
metallic
finish
nothing
bad
about
this
beer
but
nothing
stands
out
either
hard
to
review
it
since
this
style
does
not
have
a
description
there
was
a
decent
amount
of
alcohol
flavor
in
the
front
of
the
mouth
the
finish
continues
the
redundancy
of
sweetness
and
i
cant
help
but
think
that
if
the
yeast
had
more
aggressive
in
their
feasting
that
this
beer
would
have
come
out
a
little
drier
and
more
enjoyable
for
my
palate

must

one

with

a
scummy
off

it
smells
of
sweet

and
kind
of
has
a
chocolate
malt
like
ovaltine
aspect
to
it
i
didnt
quite
expect
that
so
all
in
all
in
smells
appealing
the
flavor
is
very
sweet
and
on
the
verge
of
syrupy
its
all
malt
and
actually
tastes
like
a
scottishwee
heavy
its
lightly
nutty
has
a
lot
of
sweet
fruit
going
on
its
very
interesting
and
much
better
than
i
thought
it
would
be
it
is
very
sweet
though
it
drinks
between
light
and
medium
in
body
and
is
a
really
smooth
drinker
overall
its
a
solid
brew
and
exceeded
my
expectations
o
pleasantly
surprised
by
this
beer
its
not
the
greatest
in
the
world
but
for
the
style
its
very
drinkable
and
has
a
pleasant
flavor
recommended
for
the
style
overall
not
a
bad
brew
at
all
it
tastes
good
and
is
at
least
somewhat
interesting
to
think
about
pours
a
slightly
hazy
deep
reddish
copper
brown
color
with
a
decent
beige

that
dissipates

minimal
lace
smells
of
caramel
molasses
and
brown
sugar
with
hints
of
corn
and
grain
deep
underneath
very
little
hop
presence
but
hints
of
earthy
floral
hops
sweet
caramel
toffee
and
molasses
flavor
almost
a
bit
too
sweet
little
to
no
hop
taste
whatsoever
crisp
carbonic
acid
is
the
only
thing
keeping
this
from
being
overly
cloying
medium
body
with
a
sweet
slick
mouthfeel
despite
the
fact
that
this
is
an
old
bottle
i
actually
kind
of
enjoyed
it
i
wonder
if
a
fresher
bottle
might
have
more
hops
to
counter
the
sweetness
further
research
is
surely
warranted

maybe

overall
i
think
it
worth
a
go
see
how
it
sits
on
your

this
is
the
kind
of
brew
you
will
be
quaff
on
a
regular
basis
if
the
unusual
flavor
makes
it
for
you
overall
beer
i
would
drink
again
but
not
necessarily
seek
it
out
i
am
eager
to
try
other
beers
from
this
brewery
im
a
fan
of
baltika
and
this
beer
is
no
exception
however
it
is
so
smooth
and
easy
drinking
as
to
render
it
uninteresting
still
worth
a
try
as
are
some
of
baltikas
other
offerings
overall
a
solid
brew
and
a
pleasant
surprise
id
expected
something
a
little
more
pedestrian
based
on
the
scores
but
i
dig
this
almost
reminds
me
of
a
dark
german
lager
pretty
good
stuff
and
quite
drinkable
im
usually
a
fan
of
sweet
beers
but
this
just
takes
it
a
little
too
far
too
sweet
too
cloying
with
not
enough
balance
of
bitterness
and
hops
cant
really
stomach
more
than
one
serving
of
this
picked
up
a
5l
bottle
for
1
90
in
astoria
this
beer
actually
tastes
more
like
a
vienna
lager
thanks
to
the
spicy
hop
finish
the
beer
starts
with
a
big
caramel
flavor
with
a
toasty
edge
from
a
corporate
lager
i
didnt
expect
much
but
this
had
a
balance
from
euro
pepper
and
lemon
hops
the
body
is
a
touch
thick
to
be
really
drinkable
but
id
have
a
few
copper
pour
with
a
creamy
offwhite
head
aroma
is
sweet
and
malty
with
some
hints
of
raisins
and
cookie
dough
flavor
is
sweet
and
malty
at
the
beginning
with
a
good
hint
of
dough
and
raisins
near
the
middle
finishes
sweet
with
some
hints
of
apple
skins
alcohol
warms
quite
a
nice
beer
d
i
really
enjoy
most
of
the
baltika
beers
and
this
one
was
no
exception
very
tasty
and
would
probably
buy
again
d
very
drinkable
might
have
to
let
the
wife
try
let
me
just
say
this
isnt
a
bad
beer
by
any
means
ive
had
far
more
disgusting
brews
that
being
said
this
beer
really
falls
short
in
the
taste
category
seeing
as
i
dont
have
any
general
characteristics
upon
which
to
base
euro
dark
lagers
i
can
only
go
by
what
i
know
and
i
know
this
should
be
darker
meatier
and
foamier
this
beer
was
relatively
cheap
compared
to
other
single
bombers
i
usually
pick
up
was
not
expecting
much
out
of
this
but
i
was
very
impressed
it
definately
tastes
better
than
it
smells
just
like
tika
the
guinea
piggie
lol
but
having
only
tasted
two
baltikas
so
far
i
bet
this
one
is
going
to
be
my
favorite
for
sure
remember
im
a
weirdo
shiner
drinker
from
texas
so
base
your
judgement
of
my
review
on
that
but
i
can
assure
shiner
lovers
that
the
chances
of
them
enjoying
this
beer
are
quite
high
overall
i
really
enjoyed
this
beer
and
the
large
bottle
and
was
left
wanting
more
drinkability
taste
is
not
bad
however
its
not
anything
special
either
that
combined
with
the
watery
finish
makes
it
something
that
i
dont
think
ill
buy
again

brew

the
aroma
is
actually
pretty
nice
i
get
notes
of
grapes
toffee
biscuits
and
iced
tea
the
flavor
is
similar
but
a
little
more
exciting
in
addition
to
the
dominant
toffee
malt
characteristics
i
get
earthy
and
grassy
hops
caramel
honey
and
graham
crackers
medium
mouthfeel
and
medium

not
bad
at
all
drinkability
this
beer
is
better
than
i
was
anticipating
i
rather
like
the
flavor
feel
and
smell
of
this
beer
it
might
have
to
go
into
rotation
around
here
d
baltika
4
and
6
are
two
beers
i
would
consider
sessionable
i
have
a
hard
time
imagining
be
able
to
drink
this
all
night
as
it
is
i
only
have
one
bottle
and
can
test
this
hypothesis
the
sweetness
is
a
bit
much
but
the
spice
does
provide
some
balance
a
dark
lager
i
am
not
sure
carb
is
a
little
too
soft
for
such
a
sweet
beverage
body
is
medium
drinkability
nothing
to
write
home
about
but
wont
have
much
trouble
finishing
this
one
db
cheap
stuff
wanted
to
try
some
of
their
offerings
the
flavor
has
its
good
points
but
is
a
bit
sweet
certainly
a
refreshing
dark
lager
not
bad
for
what
it
is

good

i
would
have
imagined
russian
beers
to
not
be
of
good
quality
but
this
changed
my
perception
overall
this
is
definitely
an
enjoyable
beer
especially
for
the
price
i
have
yet
to
be
disappointed
with
baltika
brews
and
this
one
is
no
exeception
drinkability
this
beer
certainly
isnt
bad
but
it
lacks
depth
that
keeps
it
from
being
a
quality
beer
its
cheap
though
and
definitely
worth
a
try
tasted
watered
down
no
hints
of
caramel
that
is
usually
present
i
expect
more
substance
from
my
dark
lagers
fairly
unremarkable
not
a
beer
to
be
recommended
but
some
may
like
it
i
like
several
of
the
baltika
brews
this
one
is
ok
wont
be
revisiting
with
examples
like
hofbrau
or
spaten
dunkel
on
hand
didnt
really
enjoy
the
experience
should
of
spend
my
euros
on
a
belgian
beer
beer
is
smooth
and
nice
finishes
cleanly
with
no
aftertaste
there
is
a
mild
sweetness
up
front
and
not
a
whole
lot
in
the
back
this
is
a
very
drinkable
beer
overall
mouthfeel
is
good
but
the
flavor
is
a
little
mild
second
taste
im
bumping
the
flavor
up
its
reasonably
sweet
and
has
a
hint
of
roast
at
the
end
but
its
not
distracting
i
like
this
beer
i
tihnk
baltika
is
criminally
underrated
on
this
website
shame
on
you
16
9
oz
bottle
picked
up
locally
well
chilled
lets
give
a
whirl
bottle
smell
is
some
molasses
some
sweet
malt
almost
smells
like
a
dubbel
not
much
hopping
pours
to
an
opaque
medium
brown
with
a
thin
quickly
disappearing
head
taste
is
heavy
thick
and
sweet
a
dark
lager
this
is
more
like
a
tripel
lots
of
molasses
and
brown
sugar
great
thick
mouthfeel
and
body
but
woah
sweet
too
sweet
for
me
this
would
probably
go
good
with
some
really
spicy
food
but
alone
its
tough
to
swill
drinkability
i
find
this
beer
to
be
cloyingly
sweet
and
too
malty
one
is
enough
as
the
combination
just
does
not
work
for
me
baltika
4
is
a
very
clear
sparkling
brown
beer
with
a
thin
bubbly
blotchy
off
white
head
that
leaves
nice
lacing
it
has
a
very
sweet
aroma
like
wort
boiling
it
also
kind
of
reminds
me
of
brown
sugar
and
sorghum
its
medium
bodied
and
smooth
with
a
dry
finish
its
pretty
sweet
and
nutty
its
a
very
simple
malt
flavor
with
a
slight
hint
of
grassy
bitterness
its
a
sweet
and
simple
affair
this
beer
pours
a
clear
watery
dark
amber
color
the
head
is
one
inch
in
height
and
recedes
quickly
into
minimal
lacing
the
aroma
is
of
caramel
and
hints
of
chocolate
it
is
a
pleasant
aroma
the
taste
is
much
like
the
aroma
it
lacks
any
sort
of
complexity
but
is
mildly
interesting
the
mouthfeel
is
medium
bodied
with
carbonation
that
is
a
little
too
low
overall
this
is
a
decent
beer
that
i
could
drink
again
notes
this
is
a
very
approachable
european
lager
however
it
has
enough
hop
presence
to
distinguish
itself
it
has
all
that
nice
easy
body
and
slight
caramel
malt
however
it
actually
has
a
hop
presence
which
most
dont
dthe
high
carbonation
makes
this
a
rough
sip
not
a
bad
taste
but
could
be
smoother
overall
not
a
very
good
beer
in
terms
of
taste
i
would
advise
you
to
buy
it
for
two
reasons
the
color
is
excellent
and
worth
pouring
just
to
see
and
the
packaging
also
is
intriguing
and
artistic
a
sweet
lager
which
i
dont
find
incredibly
pleasant
to
drink
it
hits
pretty
much
all
the
marks
for
the
style
though
and
is
a
decent
representation
of
what
it
should
be
carbonation
is
too
low
and
lets
the
sweetness
run
rampant
overall
the
beer
is
ok
but
nothing
like
i
thought
it
would
taste
with
the
name
dark
lager
its
more
like
a
light
ale
theres
a
good
balance
of
crispness
and
smoothness
is
a
wellrounded
mouthfeel
complimented
by
a
carbonation
thats
just
the
right
level
in
a
medium
to
full
body
again
my
thanks
to
mike
and
ranee
for
the
gift
offers
enough
structure
to
hold
its
own
and
shows
no
obvious
weakness
smooth
creamy
and
fullbodied
very
good
just
wish
it
looked
a
little
better
but

a

slightly

the
beige
cap
fell
after
a
few
minutes
to
a
lingering
collar
not
much
in
the
way
of
lacing
aromas
of
cereal
grain
barley
husk
caramel
and
a
kiss
of
hops
malty
grainy
sweetness
with
a
little
buttery
toffee
and
chocolate
adding
some
depth
bitterness
was
low

still
present

noticeable
in

some

final
thoughts
starts
with
a
slightly
watery
toasted
malty
slightly
fruity
crisp
and
refreshing
drink
for
summer
then
adds
all
kinds
of
weird
flavors
on
the
finish
that
only
go
away
when
you
drink
more
which
makes
you
drunk
faster
so
i
guess
it
somewhat
does
its
job
a
beautiful
deep
copper
colour
with
sweet
molasses
notes
in
the
aroma
head
is
not
persistent
but
overall
impressions
were
promising
flavour
is
sweet
malttreacle
and
bread
offset
with
a
moderate
carbonation
and
enough
hop
to
prevent
cloying
quite
enjoyable
but
the
sweetness
reduces
the
drinkability
a
little
it
kind
of
reminds
me
of
barons
black
wattle
though
they
are
different
beers
hmm
relatively
light
mouthfeel
crispy
toward
the
end
maybe
a
bit
flat
in
the
carbonation
good
drinkability
overall
a
tasty
dark
lager
tm
light
body
lacking
punch
until
the
very
end
it
is
waterlike
until
it
hits
the
back
of
the
tongue
then
the
carbonation
comes
through
same
buttery
malts
from
the
nose
are
present
on
the
palate
a
faint
hint
of
hops
balances
out
the
caramel
and
butterscotch
malts
finally
a
touch
of
banana
finishes
her
off
in
the
aftertaste
overalldrinkability
good
i
can
see
buying
this
again
reminds
of
brown
ales
and
better
then
alot
the
best
baltika
i
have
had
yet
and
a
few
months
past
its
prime
overall
its
the
best
baltika
ive
had
but
thats
only
out
of
4
i
will
have
to
try
more
from
this
russian
brewery
asap
the
foam
was
med
wheat
in
color
semi
thick
and
dissapated
rather
quickly
the
color
was
dark
ruby
red
amber
highlights
with
a
mahogany
undertone
the
smell
was
hoppy
and
dark
fruity
undertones
it
has
a
deep
lager
taste
with
a
hint
of
carmel
mouthfeel
med
to
fullbodied
a
good
throwdown
drinkability
deep
and
smooth
a
good
session
looks
red
and
perfectly
clear
smells
almost
syrupy
malty
which
it
is
tastes
of
oodles
of
pure
malt
with
just
a
hint
of
odd
metallic
astringency
holding
it
back
a
no
frills
straightforward
uncomplicated
lager
picked
up
a
bottle
for
2
25
at
blanchards
in
allston
poured
into
a
tall
lager
glass
tons
of
carbonation
with
bubbles
coating
most
sides
of
the
glass
sunset
red
color
fluffy
white
head
that
remained
afloat
for
a
lot
longer
than
expected
smell
was
of
faint
traces
of
cherry
and
licorice
taste
was
dominated
by
malt
that
pretty
much
took
over
the
beer
from
there
this
beer
was
also
a
bit
more
watery
than
i
would
at
guessed
after
my
first
glance
no
really
harsh
aftertaste
or
anything
combined
with
a
decent
abv
makes
this
beer
fairly
drinkable
this
was
my
first
baltika
from
what
i
can
remember
and
it
was
a
pleasant
surprise
this
is
a
pretty
extreme
beer
as
far
as
im
concerned
i
cant
even
notice
any
hops
just
very
very
sweet
and
malty
it
clogs
the
throat
with
its
insanity
too
much
for
more
than
a
sip
or
a
drizzle
over
a
rich
and
heavy
dessert
surprisingly
refreshing
although
there
is
that
deep
sticky
flavour
of
spicy
raisins
on
the
midpalate
i
think
its
just
too
cold
waiting
for
it
to
warm
up
now
still
waiting
okay
slightly
sour
on
the
front
very
fruity
with
overtones
of
burnt
toffee
throughout
hint
of
artificial
lemon
flavour
towards
the
back
like
those
lemon
sherbet
lollies
without
the
sherbet
the
dominant
flavour
though
is
that
toffee
raisin
character
very
heavy
for
breakfast
very
sweet
and
heavy
but
very
good
in
the
mouthfeel
id
rather
have
this
in
my
mouth
than
saddams
cock
not
all
that
drinkable
this
early
in
the
morning
but
thats
my
fucking
fault
for
drinking
it
this
early
in
the
morning
d
average
at
best
would
not
drink
a
bunch
of
them
pours
a
very
attractive
ruby
hue
with
a
tan
head
that
dissipates
quickly
smells
of
toasty
and
fruity
malts
that
promise
a
lot
of
sweet
flavors
to
come
it
is
definitely
sweet
but
not
overwhelmingly
so
maraschino
cherrylike
taste
with
lots
of
toasty
and
carmelly
malts
it
has
a
distinct
spiciness
that
is
hard
to
describe
but
makes
it
more
interesting
it
could
definitely
use
some
more
hops
to
give
it
a
nice
roundness
but
it
is
quite
good
nonetheless
i
would
rate
its
taste
higher
if
not
for
a
small
but
pesky
taste
of
alchol
that
should
not
be
detectable
in
a
beer
with
this
abv
level
along
with
the
hefeweizen
and
porter
this
is
one
of
my
favorite
baltikas
d
this
one
is
a
lot
sweeter
than
i
expected
nothing
wrong
with
a
cold
sweet
iced
tea
but
this
is
not
really
what
i
want
from
a
dark
lager
light
and
easily
drinkable
i
could
certainly
revisit
this
beer
or
have
a
couple
bottles
per
sitting
pretty
tasty
dark
lager
and
by
far
the
most
flavorful
ive
had
from
baltika
d
the
flavor
and
aroma
are
not
anything
amazing
but
i
would
consider
picking
up
a
few
of
these
if
i
wanted
to
drink
heavily
its
very
easy
drinking
and
it
by
no
measure
tastes
bad
to
me
at
least
a
cloudy
tea
in
color
with
a
small
beige
colored
head
and
no
lace
to
speak
of
smell
is
much
better
with
caramel
and
candy
and
strong
tea
aromas
present
taste
is
same
with
flavors
melding
together
nicely
mouthfeel
and
carbonation
good
russian
beers
keep
surprising
me
i
would
buy
this
beer
again
any
time
pours

it
light

good
carbonation
overall
one
of
the
best
i
had
in
the
series
drinkability
not
the
most
elegant
graceful
beer
around
but
its
a
reasonably
tasty
eastern
europe
brew
and
one
of
the
standouts
in
the
rogues
gallery
that
is
the
baltika
line
moutheel
felt
rather
thin
overall
i
did
not
enjoy
it
too
much
the
beer
is
not
bad
but
it
is
quite
unusual
and
did
not
appeal
to
my
taste
d
i
think
this
works
better
as
a
dunkel
but
still
would
have
some
faults
even
in
this
category
especially
with
regards
to
aroma
and
taste
however
if
you
are
looking
for
a
russian
beer
at
an
affordable
price
this
is
a
good
beer
for
you
d
good
stuff
overall
unique
enough
to
stand
apart
but
tame
enough
to
make
for
an
easy
drinking
brew
full
of
flavor
and
character
a
pleasure
to
drink
overly
sweet
and
toasty
taste
for
me
kind
of
acrid
and
cardboardy
some
hoodlum
unfermented
sugars
crept
up
and
stole
the
rims
of
this
civic
not
very
tasty
but
certainly
not
a
drain
pour
either
i
like
the
other
3
baltikas
ive
had
better
89
and
6
the
dark
fruitiness
is
too
prevalent
for
a
lager
imo
get
rid
of
some
of
that
sweetness
and
they
may
have
something
unimpressed
even
with
its
89
score
at
bevmo

another
pleasant
surprise
from

my
expectations
were
low
for
this
beer
but
it
provided
a
tasty
treat

a
low

a

quality
overall
decent
but
not
my
favorite
malt
presence
is
a
little
too
heavy
for
my
tastes
but
if
you
like
malty
brews
youll
probably
find
it
enjoyable
the
beer
sort
of
reminds
me
of
a
dumbed
down
version
of
becks
dark
which
is
not
a
particularly
impressive
beer
to
begin
with
however
this
beer
has
less
flavor
and
is
even
more
watery
then
becks
not
good
d
fairly
drinkable
but
the
malt
is
a
bit
one
dimensional
drinkability
is
good
its
not
the
best
beer
ive
had
but
all
things
considered
including
the
sale
price
id
drink
it
again
without
question
overall
a
fine
beer
but
not
as
good
as
others
in
its
style
d
i
think
this
is
one
of
the
better
baltika
beers
it
has
a
good
taste
thats
pretty
easy
to
drink
with
a
price
thats
dirt
cheap
for
1
75
you
have
to
try
it
once
poured
a
16
9oz
bottle
into
my
brand
spanking
new
new
belgium
globe
this
really
is
surprisingly
a
pretty
beer
when
poured
it
reminded
me
of
all
those
fancy
beer
pictures
you
see
on
the
cover
of
crappy
beer
books
this
beer
pours
almost
a
brandy
color
with
a
2
inch
beige
head
that
leaves
little
lacing
the
aroma
is
raisins
malt
and
a
little
bit
of
roasted
barley
the
taste
is
caramel
raisins
and
just
a
bit
of
barleywine
after
taste
the
mouthfeel
is
medium
bodied
and
pretty
creamy
compared
to
the
only
other
offering
ive
had
from
baltika
9
in
a
big
2
liter
plastic
bottle
this
is
heaven
sent
but
on
the
range
of
good
beer
this
falls
in
the
middle
brown
in
color
with
gentle
prickle
and
a
wispy
head
this
review
was
done
on
a
bottle
although
i
had
it
on
draft
originally
at
the
russian
house
in
washington
d
c
it
seemed
much
better
to
me
when
i
had
it
on
draft
but
it
may
have
been
the
romance
of
the
moment
it
has
a
malty
nose
with
hints
of
lightly
roasted
malts
fresh
and
smooth
attack
awkward
taste
at
first
but
builds
to
a
smooth
malty
flavor
with
pronounced
chocolate
clean
finish
i
would
call
this
beer
from
a
bottle
a
c
very
average
dunkel
which
is
fine
with
me
good
aroma
of
caramel
malts
that
is
all
i
could
pick
up
pours
a
rich
amber
color
with
a
thick
dissipating
head
that
leaves
no

relatively
smooth
mouthfeel
somewhat
thin
on
the
palate
and
a
good
aftertaste
flavor
is
solid
what
your
standard
dark
lager
should
be
i
like
this
beer
and
the
price
is
right
so
i
will
try
to
keeep
a

of
these

it
was

for
a
single
good
size
bottle
nice
for
a
dark
lager
easy
on
the
abv
not
very
enjoyable
the
light
flavors
allowed
the
imperfections
to
stick
out
d
this
is
an
okay
dark
lager
it
was
really
sweet
d
a
run
of
the
mill
dark
lager
nothing
stands
out
but
nothing
makes
me
turn
away
in
disgust
overall
this
was
a
very
good
brew
nothing
outstanding
but
still
very
good
i
agree
with
the
other
reviews
on
the
richness
and
hardiness
of
this
beer
would
be
good
for
winter
not
a
lot
of
depth
but
a
delicious
beer
and
satisfying
drink
everything
about
this
beer
works
together
well
recommended
overall
this
is
a
beer
that
is
definitely
worth
a
try
i
got
mine
for
less
than
2
a
bottle
a
decent
sized
bottle
too
it
has
the
characteristic
baltika
maltiness
but
even
more
so
since
this
is
a
darker
version
not
for
everyone
but
those
who
like
baltika
will
enjoy
it
d
ok
drinkability
i
had
never
heard
of
a
dark
lager
before
but
this
was
a
really
interesting
drink
i
drank
this
straight
from
the
bottle
so
im
not
really
sure
what
it
looked
like
however
it
had
a
strong
molasses
flavor
that
was
interesting
and
mostly
enjoyable
its
mouthfeel
was
thicker
than
any
of
the
other
baltikas
it
was
sweet
at
first
with
a
slight
bitterness
in
the
aftertaste
interesting
specialty
beer
d
a
slightly
below
par
dark
lager
i
drank
this
beer
quite
a
bit
while
in
russia
and
uzbekistan
apparently
my
nostalgic
thoughts
were
misplaced
d
this
is
an
outstanding
brew
but
i
dont
think
i
could
stomach
more
than
one
due
to
the
outrageous
sugary
cake
batter
sweetness
pours
a
slightly
hazy
medium
dark
amber
color
with
lots
of
brownish
tan
head
and
great
tracing
aromas
of
sweet
caramel
melanoidin
toastiness
light
dark
fruity
aromas
and
just
a
touch
of
hops
on
the
palate
it
really
opens
up
lots
of
sweet
chocolate
flavor
toasted
bread
raisin
toffee
and
a
hint
of
spice
hop
flavor
is
close
to
none
and
bitterness
is
just
barely
there
not
enough
to
keep
up
with
the
sweetness
carbonation
is
medium
low
providing
a
rich
malty
mouthfeel
a
little
too
sweet
for
my
taste
hurting
drinkability
with
the
introduction
of
a
new
beer
department
guy
at
the
grocery
comes
a
few
changes
on
the
shelves
fortunately
quality
imported
lagers
are
among
his
favorites

the

exudes
berry

faint

but
is
a

weak
the
taste
is
better
a
little
more

than
the

and
the
mix
of

makes
for
a
candyish
taste
without
going
overboard
the

goes
flat
a
bit
early
a
disappointment
and
resulting
in
a
lower
drinkability
than
it
otherwise
might
have
received
a
fairly
good

could

a
bottle
definitely
drinkable
candy
in
a
glass
this
was
my
first
baltika
brew
and
i
was
very
surprised
at
how
nice
it
was
the
smell
was
of
a
sweet
malt
reminding
me
of
a
doppelbock
the
taste
had
a
great
semisweet
flavor
with
a
very
slight
hop
bitterness
in
the
end
to
round
it
out
nicely
the
bitterness
didnt
linger
at
all
in
the
finish
i
will
definatley
be
buying
some
more
baltika
dark
lager
very
soon
my
first
thought
was
that
this
dark
lager
was
pretty
much
a
watereddown
baltika
porter
maybe
i
should
have
had
this
before
the
porter
highly
recommended
d
all
in
all
not
a
bad
beer
somewhat
unique
to
what
i
have
had
before
very
drinkable
would
be
good
year
round
next
was
the
dark
lager

i
find
this
addition
from

quite
good
i
could
drink
a
gallon
of
this
stuff
easy
no
real

flavors
just
thick
malt
sweetness
with
some
prunes
or
raisins
neither
complex
nor
awe
inspiring
but
pleasant
better
than
expected
after
reading
the
reviews
sweet
with
hints
of
raisins
strong
malt
and
no
hops
to
speak
of
a
bit
more
alcohol
taste
than
you
would
expect
at

still
prefer
the
baltika
porter
but
a
good
change
of
pace
for
a

like
me
great

at

much

dunkel

available
poured
into
a
pint
glass
from

the

pours
a
deep

a
1
inch
creamy

good
amount
of
light
lacing
along

the

with
a
light

medium
mouthfeel
full

smooth

make
for
a
very
drinkable
and
sessionable
ale
overall
i
enjoyed
this
brew
more
than
i
thought
definitely
worth
drinking
again
d
a
style
i
havent
had
much
of
but
am
appreciating
as
a
very
tasty
session
beer
when
i
want
malt
over
hops
as
in
now
in
winter
without
being
full
from
a
few
like
can
happen
with
stouts
scotch
ales
and
the
like
the
only
real
downside
is
the
pricing
ive
only
seen
this
beer
in
bombers
and
its
usually
not
cheap
still
dont
let
that
take
away
from
this
brew
its
excellent
and
multipurpose
when
i
first
poured
it
i
couldnt
tell
what
color
it
was
because
there
were
so
many
carbonation
bubbles
that
it
blocked
my
eyes
from
peering
into
the
beer
when
they
left
i
saw
that
the
beer
is
a
murky
brown
but
when
held
up
into
the
light
it
was
then
a
dark
cranberry
red
color
it
had
a
nice
and
fluffy
1
finger
head
of
white
foam
that
when
it
dissipated
away
it
decided
to
leave
a
small
film
of
white
foam
some
white
rings
and
a
just
a
small
spatter
of
white
sticky
lace
here
and
there
it
had
a
light
aroma
of
milk
chocolate
caramel
toasted
malts
and
a
small
hint
of
peppery
hops
when
i
swirled
it
around
to
see
if
i
could
get
the
aroma
to
wake
up
this
slight
smell
of
vegetables
came
out
from
hiding
it
didnt
ruin
the
smell
but
it
didnt
need
to
be
there
whatever
you
do
dont
swirl
it
around
to
wake
the
aroma
up
it
had
a
very
nice
light
gentle
taste
of
milk
chocolate
a
touch
of
sweet
caramel
toasted
malts
and
the
slightest
taste
of
hops
at
the
end
i
couldnt
tell
what
kind
of
hops
they
were
because
the
taste
of
hops
was
too
small
the
mouthfeel
was
nice
and
light
with
an
aftertaste
of
clean
water
thats
good
roasted
and
toasted
malts
and
a
hint
of
milk
chocolate
i
think
i
might
have
found
a
new
cheap
1
80
for
this
big
bottle
decent
light
beer
this
was
another
one
of
those
beers
that
i
kept
taking
sip
after
sip
and
then
finding
out
the
i
had
just
drank
the
whole
bottle
without
even
noticing
it
i
will
get
another
bottle
of
this
in
the
near
future
i
sure
hope
i
dont
break
the
bank
if
i
buy
another
one
nothing
spectacular
here
but
i
wouldnt
turn
down
one
either
an
interesting
beer
with
a
slightly
unusual
taste
for
this
style
worth
trying
and
its
pretty
cheap
too
but
hardly
anything
spectacular
the
drinkability
is
very
good
for
those
with
an
open
mind
i
like
this
brew
a
lot
and
fell
that
is
is
over
looked
and
under
rated
prosit
mk
tried
this
beer
tonight
at
the
bier
stein
eugene
or
not
nearly
as
dark
as
i
would
expect
a
dark
lager
to
be
more
of
a
dark
amber
thick
creamy
head
slight
sour
taste
possibly
the
rye
malt
coming
through
tasted
better
than
i
thought
it
would
to
be
honest
i
smelled
the
faintest
notes
of
apple
to
me
it
seemed
to
have
a
fizzy
texture
not
bubbly
but
i
would
compare
the
texture
to
a
witbier
like
hoegarden
perhaps
easy
to
drink
there
is
little
carbonation
in
the
flat
but
creamy
brew
and
while
its
easy
to
drink
it
wont
be
my
first
choice
upon
next
bottleshop
visit
nor
a
regular
choice
there
really
are
layers
of
flavors
in
this
brew
and
im
enjoying
the
discovery
drinkability
not
something
id
get
regularly
but
its
a
good
drinker
notes
oddly
enough
even
though
this
beer
wasnt
great
for
some
reason
it
makes
me
look
forward
to
trying
the
rest
of
the
s
in
the
baltika
line
drinkability
i
would
have
preferred
to
share
this
bottle
glad
ive
had
my
first
russian
beer
though
wont
seek
this
one
out
though

from
the

tan

foamy

is

and
a

maybe
a
little
oversweet
slightly
chocolately

though
overall
thicker
than
2

and
ok
for
the

a
good

a

tiny

sweet

is

and
malty
slight

aftertaste
whole

is
decent
and
smooth
ok
drinkability
not
bad
too
sweet
for
me
will
not
buy
again
would
pair
brilliantly
with
any
slow
cooked
full
flavored
beef
or
pork
dish
but
certainly
stuffed
cabbage
with
a
tomato
based
sauce
would
be
great
as
well
enjoy
i
kinda
want
to
compare
this
beer
to
german
dunkels
because
of
the
firm
pilsner
base
that
holds
more
maltiness
than
graininess
but
with
added
amber
grains
that
said
the
grains
add
a
caramel
and
lightly
toasted
bread
flavor
but
not
as
much
as
good
dunkels
its
not
as
caramellike
or
toffeelike
as
english
redsjust
caught
somewhere
in
between
an
underlying
sweetness
is
noticed
but
undefined
powder
sugarlike
not
a
bad
beer
just
remains
a
bit
vague
for
me
drinkability
this
is
a
pretty
drinkable
beer
but
would
you
want
to
considering
the
choices
out
there
its
worth
a
try
for
sure
and
if
you
get
a
hold
of
a
6pack
you
wont
get
bored
of
it
but
better
tasting
beer
is
out
there
id
recommend
trying
porter
from
baltika
which
is
quite
a
delight
pours
a
deep
orangeish
brown
nice
tight
creamy
head
that
fades
away
but
clings
to
the
glass
the
smell
is
yeasty
and
a
little
malty
tastes
very
sweetmalty
tiny
bit
of
bitterness
with
some
hop
flavor
but
not
enough
to
really
make
out
what
it
is
some
citrus
so
maybe
cascade
some
caramel
notes
as
well
its
thick
and
creamy
some
carbonation
scraping
on
the
tongue
but
not
too
much
all
in
all
its
very
drinkable
i
would
buy
it
again
drinkable
i
could
easily
enjoy
another
a
smooth
drink
and
i
really
rather
enjoyed
it
i
will
definately
be
buying
this
again
served
in
a
pint
glass
it
pours
a
cloudy
brownorange
color
with
an
offwhite
fluffy
head
i
can
only
smell
caramel
and
bready
malts
not
much
else
since
the
aroma
isnt
strong
it
tastes
the
same
way
to
me
like
caramel
and
malt
it
finishes
slightly
bitter
but
the
aftertaste
doesnt
linger
for
too
long
the
mouthfeel
is
slick
with
a
lightmedium
body
it
is
relatively
easy
to
drink
with
not
too
much
carbonation
its
an
ok
beer
i
guess
nothing
impressive
but
its
not
awful
either
one
day
ill
have
to
try
a
fresher
bottle
of
this
id
drink
this
again
but
i
dont
think
this
will
become
a
regular
beer
for
me
despite
its
blandness
and
lack
of
anything
special
it
was
somewhat
drinkable
but
that
was
due
more
to
its
water
qualities
than
beer
qualities
it
used
to
be
a
very
pleasant
dark
beer
with
substantial
notes
of
rye
reminding
to
some
of
us
homemade
black
bread
sadly
to
say
quality
has
diminished
in
last
two
or
three
years
and
now
no
4
is
another
example
of
highly
publicized
crap
from
former
ussr
there
is
an
unpleasant
tone
in
aroma
even
more
unpleasant
sourness
in
the
palate
and
quite
a
lowgrade
aftertaste
stopped
buying
it
not
worth
a
try
definitely
the
beers
from
baltika
brewery
has
been
a
pleasant
surprise
just
stay
away
for
9
as
that
stuff
is
swill
one
finger
tan
head
moderate
carb
bubbles
and
reddish
brown
body
coriander
pepper
bit
of
banana
esters
not
an
overpowering
aroma
altogether
mouthfeel
is
medium
heavy
fizzy
slightly
chewy
leads
you
to
expect
more
out
of
this
than
what
you
get
taste
is
overwhelmingly
malt
maybe
a
hint
of
hops
on
the
back
end
drinkable
but
not
really
impressive
in
any
regard
last
swigs
tastes
like
crunchy
pretzels
gotta
dig
the
cheap
big
bottles
of
baltika
always
an
adventure
this
is
actually
not
bad
ive
never
tried
a
beer
brewed
in
russia
before
so
this
seemed
like
a
nice
change
from
the
norm
poured
a
cloudy
brownish
red
color
with
no
head
and
a
very
small
white
lacing
that
one
could
barely
notice
smell
was
very
nice
dark
fruits
honey
candy
taste
was
even
better
with
some
sugars
accentuating
the
flavors
that
had
noticed
in
the
smell
it
also
has
an
almost
juicy
character
that
one
would
not
expect
from
the
description
on
the
back
of
the
bottle
mouthfeel
was
hoppy
and
medium
bodied
with
the
hops
hitting
you
up
front
leading
into
the
juicy
tastes
seemed
very
well
balanced
as
well
i
could
see
myself
drinking
a
few
of
these
and
still
wanting
more
next
time
im
at
the
dan
murphys
im
picking
up
some
more
of
these
as
i
was
taken
aback

the

rife

this

and
caramel
the
taste
is

its
not
really
my
cup
of

so
to
speak
but
it
is
interesting
for
what
it
is
definitely
not
bad
ive
been
pleasantly
surprised
by
the
beers
from
this
brewery
i
really
didnt
have
very
high
expectations
and
while
their
beers
are
not
spectacular
they
certainly
arent
bad
either
worth
a
try
i
wouldnt
go
looking
for
this

i
wouldnt

would

try

again

by
no

would
go
out

flavor
spices
in
the
finish
no
real

this
is
a

the
nutty
flavors
are
nice
but
the
sweetness
is
cloying
alcohol
level
is
noticable
and
high
i
became
bored
with
this
beer
long
before
i
reached
the
end
of
the
half
liter
could
be
worse
but
certainly
nothing
ill
ever
buy
again
mouthfeel

medium
drinkability
an
above

dark

lager
pretty
pleasing
compared
to
what
i
was
expecting
definitely
worth
a
try
at
2
per
this
sweetness
is
just
right
a
thin
brew
on
the
high
carbonated
side
overall
not
bad
just
weak
weak
seems
to
be
the
defining
word
here
if
offered
i
would
partake
just
will
not
seek
out
for
purchase
color
is
of
powdered
ice
tea
this
beer
has
a
nice
dried
fruit
armoa
especially
raisins
its
funny
but
a
russian
beer
reminds
me
of
irish
soda
bread
with
raisins
a
inviting
aroma
for
those
cold
russian
summer
nights
taste
is
simple
touch
of
fruittouch
of
tea
bit
grainy
in
the
mouth
definitly
a
cold
climate
beer
the
aftertaste
is
very
subtle
but
has
a
lasting
effect
a
good
beer
with
dinner
if
you
just
need
something
to
help
wash
down
the
food
id
much
rather
enjoy
this
beer
while
camping
in
the
fall
and
eating
some
stew
out
of
a
can
this
is
my
first
baltika
but
it
wont
be
my
last
not
too
bad
at
all
i
really
dont
think
its
a
true
lager
but
it
tastes
ok
to
me
feel
is
clean
and
creamy
within
a
medium
sticky
malt
laden
body
not
too
sweet
it
seems
to
fit
just
right
for
what
it
is
which
is
pretty
good
all
around
in
flavor
body
and
drinkability
just
sweet
enough
with
just
the
right
amount
of
light
dryness
a
very
nice
little
dark
lager
much
better
from
other
times
ive
ventured
to
try
it
by
far
the
best
sample
yet
helps
to
get
it
fresh
well
as
fresh
as
it
can
get
being
from
the
otherside
of
the
earth
poured
a
very
cloudy
reddish
brown
color
with
moderate
head
smell
is
of
caramel
mioxed
with
toasted
malt
taste
follows
through
with
carame
also
some
molasses
prsent
too
sweet
for
my
taste
almost
like
a
scottish
ale
but
not
as
good
finished
with
more
sweetness
ok
but
not
something
to
try
again
drinkability
although
an
interesting
brew
ultimately
this
one
becomes
very
difficult
to
finish
the
hotness
carbonation
and
full
body
makes
it
very
filling
and
the
bitterness
is
not
particularly
enjoyable
the
mouthfeel
is
rather
light
and
clean
revealing
its
lager
rather
than
ale
background
but
if
you
consider
it
a
vienna
lager
its
pretty
close
to
style
overall
good
but
not
great
i
could
session
this
though
baltika
4
is
one
of
the
better
edls
that
ive
had
so
far
it
cleaves
pretty
closely
to
the
style
guidelines
as
i
understand
them
and
wins
its
drinker
over
with
competence
rather
than
flash
batika
is
perhaps
the
best
of
the
former
eastern
bloc
breweries
and
continues
to
impress
in
a
moderate
expectations
kind
of
way
drinkability
lets
just
say
one
bottle
is
enough
while
i
enjoyed
this
beer
i
would
definatly
retire
this
after
one
my
dad
took
and
a
few
sips
and
found
it
to
be
quite
enjoyabe
overall
it
was
alright
it
was
unique
and
worth
trying
pours
a
brilliantly
clear
ruby
color
when
held
up
to
the
light
it
is
tipped
by
a
frothy
slightly
rocky
light
tan
colored
head
i
smell
aromas
of
thin
grain
slight
caramel
and
a
hint
of
toasted
dark
grain
character
the
beer
has
a
light
filling
fullness
to
it
as
it
hits
my
palate
for
the
first
time
there
is
a
light
caramel
sweetness
here
and
it
is
joined
by
a
slightly
herbal
almost
menthol
like
character
this
beer
has
a
slight
character
of
aged
malt
in
the
finish
but
other
than
this
it
is
pretty
clean
the
finish
on
this
beer
is
lightly
sweet
with
a
light
complimenting
bitterness
drinkability
pleasant
although
not
earthshattering
beer
i
am
glad
that
they
began
distributing
this
to
texas
mouthfeel
was
very
nice
creamy
oily
enough
carbonation
to
penetrate
the
taste
into
your
gums
yumm
sticks
to
the
roof
of
your
mouth
type
of
beer
very
solid
dark
lager
the
mouthfeel
is
too
light
and
the
sweetness
gets
annoying
after
a
while
the
beer
is
highly
carbonated
and
goes
down
well
it
is
easy
drinking
and
not
bad
i
think
it
should
be
relabeled
as
an
oktoberfestmarzen
though
mouthfeel
is
plesant
though
and
easy
drinkable
could
just
have
litle
more
taste
baltika
4
is
dark
brown
in
color
with
an
above
averagesized
light
brown
head
retention
is
pretty
good
the
aroma
is
of
dark
caramel
malts
very
german
in
smell
but
not
as
powerful
as
it
could
be
the
taste
is
also
very
germanlike
very
full
and
malty
caramel
and
bready
tastes
with
some
sugary
sweetness
this
definently
isnt
a
typical
generic
dark
euro
lager
there
is
plenty
of
ease
in
drinkability
without
sacrifice
of
flavor
too
sweet
for
my
tastes
but
a
wellbrewed
beer
and
the
second
best
ive
tasted
of
the
baltika
line
after
the
wheat
poured
a
distinct
translucent
amber
with
a
2
finger
tan
head
that
slooowly
dissipated
leaving
a
cover
on
top
and
some
lacing
aroma
of
bread
and
dark
fruits
taste
was
malty
and
fruity
with
medium
body
and
a
slightly
bitter
finish
with
all
these
semi
obscure
and
very
interesting
beers
on
the
market
i
doubt
ill
ever
buy
a
macro
again
the
mouthfeel
is
smooth
rich
and
creamy
drinkability
is
for
me
fantastic
i
love
the
rye
bread
flavor
i
percieve
easily
one
of
the
best
eurolagers
ive
had
would
make
a
nice
session
brew
drinkability

this
was
on
the
lighter
side
of
the
edls
that
ive
had
but
it
was
very
tasty
and
made
for
a
great
midafternoon
snack
i
told
myself
this
would
be
the
final
baltika
beer
id
try
but
i
enjoyed
this
one
especially
when
it
was
cold
really
enjoyed
this
dark
lager
chilled
d
a
nice
mellow
all
malt
brew
that
is
well
built
but
not
very
interesting
there
is
no
depth
to
the
malt
and
no
hops
or
alcohol
to
support
it
it
also
had
a
powerful
carbonation
that
detracted
from
the
brew
the
beer
pours
a
deep
rosey
amber
color
with
a
finger
of
head
that
falls
to
coat
the
beer
the
nose
is
raisiney
and
bready
and
caramel
sweet
the
flavor
is
right
there
with
the
nose
big
bit
of
riasiney
very
slight
roasted
in
the
background
not
bad
the
feel
is
a
little
thin
for
the
flavor
i
want
a
more
robust
feel
on
it
overall
this
is
an
okay
beer
im
not
really
going
back
to
it
as
fast
as
i
would
a
better
beer
starts
with
a
big
frothy
head
that
hangs
around
atop
a
good
amber
body
happy
little
beer
smell
slightly
better
than
your
average
dark
beer
taste
is
a
little
bit
biscuity
but
mouthfeel
is
somewhat
watery
its
labaled
as
original
some
presumably
this
was
the
first
style
for
this
brand
drinkability
is
average
id
drink
it
again
but
id
drink
a
lot
of
things
again
definitely
not
bad
poured

yellow

with

stayed
around
for
a

with

a

maybe
honey
slight
bitterness
flavor
was
about
the
same
not
to
bad
of
a
beer
but
noy
overly
impressed
by
it
i
was
tremendously
impressed
with
this
one
for
those
who
seemed
skeptical
perhaps
this
just
wasnt
for
them
i
however
was
greatly
impressed
with
this
one
it
poured
a
reddish
brown
colour
very
red
and
crystal
clear
about
a
12mm
thick
head
that
quickly
subsided
to
a
thin
haze
at
this
point
im
still
expecting
mediocrity
perhap
something
even
substandard
i
gave
my
glass
a
swirl
and
took
a
smell
wow
malt
and
some
sweetness
and
that
sweetness
is
undeniably
caramel
big
sweet
caramel
malt
smell
the
taste
too
was
big
malt
and
sweet
a
little

the
finish

cinnamon
some
light

sugar
and
some
toffee
and
sweet
pear
smooth
and
creamy
mouthfeel
leads
to
a
sweet
malty
flavor
a
little
syrupy
only
the
second
beer
ive
ever
called
cloying
there
is
molasses
and
sweet
toffee
and
tingly
undercurrent
of
hops
in
the
finish
a
strange
aftertaste
lingers
cant
put
my
finger
on
that
flavor
but
it
may
keep
me
from
finishing
the
bottle
ive
been
burned
by
several
russian
or
insert
variant
former

entity
here
beers
so
i
wasnt
expecting
too
much
from
my
first
pass
at
this
brewery
i
guess
my
basic
reaction
is
not
too
bad
chestnut
amberishbrown
with
a
nice
head
that
stayed
a
while
some
caramel
and
cane
sugar
in
the
flavor
pretty
sweet
but
not
over
the
top
finish
is
clean
on
the
heavyhanded
side
for
a
lager
but
still
drinkable
this
beer
is
a
dark
amber
brown
color
with
alight
tan
head
that
does
not
stick
around
for
long
it
has
a
malty
sweet
aroma
with
a
hint
of
molasses
the
first
taste
gives
you
that
molasses
witha
hint
of
licorice
followed
by
a
more
balanced
maltyness
with
a
slight
hop
spiceyness
even
after
the
distinctive
flavors
weaken
by
the
middle
of
the
bottle
you
are
still
left
with
a
malty
sweetness
at
the
back
of
your
tongue
nice
this
copper
brown
lager
formed
an
attractive
head
when
poured
into
a
pint
glass
there
was
little
aroma
simple
hints
of
grassy
spices
the
flavors
were
watery
caramel
spices
and
a
lager
yeast
finish
while
it
wasnt
impressive
this
brew
was
quite
easy
to
drink
drinkable
no
this
is
crap
ok
so
this
isnt
oe

but
it
is
bad

finish

little

much
on
the
sweet
side
medium
to
lighter
side
on
the
mouth
just
too
sweet
for
me
not
balenced
enough
to
make
it
better
than
just
average
surprisingly
i
found
that
i
hadnt
had
this
yet
and
chose
it
to
accompany
ukrainian
meatballs
at
karmancyks
russian
deli
in
nordeast
minneapolis
for
lunch
today
and
they
met
each
other
well
a
tasty
beer
that
probably
is
better
than
my
rating
indicates
nice
malty
flavor
and
smells
pretty
good
goes
down
smooth
with
a
nice
aftertaste
its
weird
that
i
cant
come
up
with
more
to
describe
it
its
good
but
nothing
really
stands
out
i
would
buy
it
again
very
drinkable
will
purchase
again
poured

is
flat

unimpressive

the
appearance

big
letdown
bit
of
hops
to
lead
things
off
then
when
you
expect
the
caramel
and
toasted
malt
flavors
you
get
a
big
hole
filled
with
a
vague
malt
flavor
that
never
truly
develops
to
its
potential
finishes
off
with
a
nice
hop
aftertaste
kinda
like
a
bite
but
more
of
a
slow
gnawing
instead
mouthfeel
is
alright
medium

very
drinkable

not
too
interesting

keep
ordering

better

a

the

not
great

there

the
balance
between

there
is
an
annoying

here
it
tastes
like
a
dark
whitbread
ale
the
mouthfeel
is
alright
i
would
like
a
little
more
carbonation
and
a
lighter
body
it
drinks
fairly
well
this
is
my
first
russian
brewed
ale
this
bier
was
pretty
good
looking
but
when
i
drank
it
i
wondered
how
something
as
dark
as
this
could
be
so
watery
in
taste
no
real
hoppiness
at
all
in
the
nose
or
on
the
tongue
caramel
malts
come
through
as
well
as
some
molasses
finishes
with
a
spicy
alcohol
taste
the
finish
is
the
best
part
of
this
one
when
this
beer
was
poured
into
my
glass
it
poured
a
large
offwhite
head
with
finesmall
bubbles
there
was
fizzy
carbonation
observed
with
this
beer
the
beer
had
excelent

the
body
was
clear
and
the
hue
was
amber
the
nose
was
malty
and
the
flavor
was
somewhat
bitter
the
body
is
light
and
thin
and
the
mouthfeel
was
smooth
and
thin
this
is
a
very
drinkable
beer
that
goes
down
very
easily
i
hope
to
have
the
chance
to

this
one

this
brewery
i
like
time
to
get
some
more
poured
a
clear
red
amber
with
a
nice
head
that
left
way
too
soon
big
malt
sweets
dominate
this
brew
fruity
is
there
too
balance
is
seemingly
unwanted
but
almost
achieved
a
spicy
bitter
is
there
but
im
not
sure
it
tastes
all
that
much
like
a
hop
bitter
a
drinkable
beer
but
nothing
extra
special
however
im
not
sure
how
baltikas
lighter
incarnations
would
fare
in
my
taste
tests
as
this
dark
beer
is
really
more
of
an
amber
the
bottle
pops
like
a
soda
bottle
when
you
open
it
not
a
good
sign
theres
also
too
much
foam
in
the
head
the
good
news
so
to
speak
is
that
this
too
much
head
disappears
very
quickly
the
remaining
lace
is
ok
but
it
slides
down
a
bit
too
quickly
there
is
also
a
hint
of
sourness
in
the
bouquet
maybe
not
the
best
bottle
to
judge
by
the
color
is
a
nice
caramel
malt
while
the
taste
has
a
definite
hoppy
bite
the
sour
nose
does
not
translate
to
the
tongue
it
is
a
bit
thin
in
the
mouth
but
the
hops
persist
leaving
a
nice
impression
this
is
a
good
drinkable

slightly
in
the
finish
from
the
somewhat
subdued
hopping
then
sweetens
up
as
it
fades
out
i
wasnt
expecting
too
much
from
this
one
but
i
do
say
that
i
enjoyed
this
one
until
the
last
drop
smoky
amber
color
a
rough
pour
produced
a
bubbly
beige
head
didnt
last
long
at
all
some
minor
lacing
thin
and
wispy
head
barely
covers
the
top
smell
is
faintly
of
toasted
carmel
malt
taste
is
somewhat
sweet
carmel
malts
and
added
sugars
not
much
hops
to
balance
thin
and
watery
but
not
overly
carbonated
beer
seems
to
thin
out
and
flavors
evaporate
as
it
warms
slightly
sweet
malt
and
sugar
finish
lingers
nothing
really
wrong
with
this
beer
just
a
little
away
from
being
good
the
bumpy
rocky
well
retained
head
sits
atop
a
garnet
hued
crystal
clear
brew
the
overall
mellow
aroma
is
comprised
of
herbal
hops
dark
caramel
sweetness
and
a
hint
of
chocolate
malt
malt
sweetness
persists
at
a
high
level
from
start
to
finish
in
this
brew
tapered
only
slightly
by
meager
hop
and
roasted
malt
bitterness
depth
of
malt
character
is
lacking
w
notes
of
dark
munich
malt
overshadowed
by
the
strong
sweetness
that
being
said
sweetness
never
becomes
cloying
and
this
brew
retains
decent
drinkability
lightly
bodied
w
an
underattenuated
sugary
mouthfeel
that
lends
an
artificial
fullness
finishes
expectedly
sweet
w
light
toasty
malt
on
the
back
of
the
tongue
baltika
dark
although
lacking
all
around
in
character
for
a
dunkel
is
a
unique
brew
in
itself
although
it
grew
on
me
as
i
drank
it
the
sweetness
is
a
touch
overbearing
an
attractive
beer
reddishbrown
with
a
big
tan
head
there
is
a
noticeable
metallic
and
astringent
flaw
in
the
beer
but
it
is
drinkable
sweet
molasses
and
malt
nose
not
a
lot
of
bitterness
and
sometimes
cloying
alcohol
is
pronounced
for
the
concentration
i
didnt
know
what
to
expect
i
bought
the
bottle
simply
because
id
never
had
a
russian
beer
before
159
pours
a
dark
brown
amber
in
color
the
aromas
were
of
fruit
and
caramel
malt
the
same
on
the
palate
didnt
really
enjoy
it
i
may
of
had
a
bad
bottle
im
not
sure
i
did
not
inspect
it
well
i
was
sitting
on
the
stoop
with
the
neighbors
in
any
sense
i
will
have
to
rereview
it
notes
quite
and
interesting
brew
an
oddity
to
enjoy
perhaps
not
whole
heartedly
bad
but
not
what
one
would
expect
in
a
beer
in
the
traditional
sense
very
rarely
am
i
so
rough
on
a
beer
but
this
stuff
is
god
awful
it
smelled
like
metal
so
bad
that
i
could
barely
get
past
that
there
was
no
substance
to
the
beer
very
flat
and
no
taste
if
anything
it
tastes
like
it
smelled
bad
it
did
have
a
decent
color
though
pours
to
a
buff
head
that
lasts
and
laces
transparent
ruby
black
color
slight
roast
and
decocted
malt
aroma
with
a
honeylike
floral
hop
note
flavor
is
reminiscent
of
molasses
coffee
and
toffee
with
a
balancing
clean
bitterness
and
hop
spice
mouthfeel
is
light
medium
overall
an
outstandingly
satisfying
and
complex
dark
lager
this
is
truly
a
finely
crafted
lager
poured
into
a
33
cl
žatec
glass
pours
a
dark
mahogany
with
an
appetizing
head
wonderful
complex
caramel
chocolate
slightly
sweetroasted
nose
taste
confirms
the
nose
and
boy
is
there
a
lot
to
taste
in
this
wonderfully
crafted
czech
beer
light
rolling
body
that
actually
build
up
a
bit
on
the
back
end
nice
roasted
character
and
toasted
malts
caramel
and
toffee
on
the
side
of
the
tongue
burnt
malt
bitterness
with
a
touch
of
alcohol
heat
a
little
thin
up
front
but
has
no
astringencies
obviously
well
crafted
but
not
something
that
butters
my
biscuit
there
is
nothing
bad
about
this
beer
i
would
just
prefer
others
before
reaching
for
this
good
beer
faithful
to
style
and
very
pleasant
to
drink
a
beer
not
for
drinking
a
single
bottle
once
it
has
a
good
mix
between
drinkability
and
flavor
taste
is
dryish
toasty
bread
crust
lightly
sweet
caramelised
prunes
raisins
woodypeppery
light
bitterness
dry
toastiness
dominating
finish
o
i
much
prefer
this
over
the
zatec
pilsner
a
nice
sessionable
lager
finishes
with
roast
and
light
chocolate
easy
drinking
and
unoffensive
poured
from
a
500
ml
bottle
into
a
14
oz
pint
glass
pours
a
dark
black
with
a
large
off
white
head
smells
of
dark
roasted
malt
and
some
flowery
hops
tastes
of
malt
with
some
chocolatey
overtones
and
some
hops
a
nice
surprise
for
a
dark
lager
beer
is
carbonated
perfectly
and
has
good
balance
for
its
light
body
overall
a
pretty
good
beer
overall
drinkability
quite
a
nice
beer
but
i
find
one
is
enough
there
are
aspects
of
this
beer
which
are
very
much
doppelbock
in
style
aroma
especially
sometimes
the
taste
which
perhaps
makes
this
an
even
more
appealing
beer
in
he
end
tasty
aromatic
and
yet
one
500
ml
is
enough
i
guess
this
beer
is
nicely
sating
as
well
so
while
i
tried
it
im
not
seeing
a
desire
to
go
out
and
get
more
an
ok
schwartzbier
but
the
waxlike
flavours
spoils
it
a
bit
pours
a
curious
translucent
muddy
caramel
color
similar
to
maudite
with
a
frothy
tan
head
that
dissipates
in
fairly
short
order
the
aroma
is
mild
and
clean
with
a
malt
sweetness
akin
to
maple
syrup
the
syrupy
sweetness
manifests
much
more
in
the
taste
which
is
almost
bocklike
not
a
whole
lot
of
complexity
here
in
spite
of
the
saaz
hops
touted
by
the
label
to
me
the
body
is
too
light
to
support
the
malty
backbone
which
perplexes
the
palate
and
makes
the
beer
taste
watered
down
in
spite
of
the
pronounced
sweetness
there
is
some
consolation
in
the
fact
that
the
finish
is
cleaner
than
one
would
expect
but
on
the
whole
i
feel
this
brew
misses
the
mark
being
short
on
identity
and
lacking
in
complexity
overall
i
started
to
like
this
beer
a
little
more
as
i
drank
it
i
feel
that
its
way
too
carbonated
though
but
it
has
a
good
taste
profile
well
composed
balanced
and
easy
to
drink
overall
not
a
bad
beer
at
all
though
i
wish
there
a
bit
more
hops
involved
to
balance
out
the
sweeter
flavors
o
good
drinker
that
goes
down
easy
good
example
of
the
style
well
worth
checking
out
overall
i
wish
this
beer
werent
so
mild
but
that
being
said
it
is
still
quite
tasty
and
very
quaffable
indeed
id
have
this
again
o
a
little
too
out
of
balance
for
me
to
really
enjoy
i
want
a
slight
amount
of
bitterness
andor
hops
to
make
the
flavor
profile
whole
for
me
not
overly
easy
to
drink
not
sure
that
i
would
really
want
to
go
out
of
my
way
to
sample
this
again
o
this
beer
isnt
overly
difficult
to
drink
but
could
use
a
little
more
hops
to
help
balance
out
some
of
the
sweetness
out
of
a
bottle
this
beer
was
a
dark
brown
color
with
some
garnet
highlights
that
appeared
when
held
up
to
sunlight
the
head
was
a
thin
layer
of
tan
foam
that
retained
fairly
well
and
left
sliding
bands
of
lacing
the
aroma
was
of
chocolate
brown
sugar
molasses
bread
and
toasted
malt
the
flavors
were
just
plain
delicious
and
i
was
impressed
i
tasted
lots
of
chocolate
caramel
and
some
honey
followed
by
some
earthy
malt
and
toasted
malt
i
also
tasted
some
dark
fruits
as
it
warmed
up
the
finish
was
clean
and
crisp
aided
by
just
enough
czech
saaz
hops
the
mouthfeel
was
smooth
the
body
medium
and
the
carbonation
perfect
this
in
short
was
the
best
authentic
euro
dark
lager
ive
ever
had
and
i
can
now
see
what
this
brewery
has
been
doing
for
over
a
1000
years
ill
be
on
the
lookout
for
more
of
these
tmavé
lagers
and
ill
likely
grab
some
more
bottles
of
this
particular
beer
in
the
future
rock
solid
if
other
dark
czech
lagers
are
anything
like
this
one
i
need
to
go
overall
this
is
almost
exactly
what
i
am
looking
for
in
a
dark
lager
the
effervescence
and
clean
finish
of
a
lager
with
the
depth
of
malt
character
and
well
constructed
hop
profile
of
an
ale
im
a
little
surprised
by
this
one
as
i
didnt
expect
much
but
it
was
pretty
good
im
not
saying
this
is
a
beer
thats
going
too
blow
you
away
but
for
the
style
of
beer
its
great
deep
amber
capped
by
a
slight
off
white
head
with
good
retention
scent
is
pretty
clean
hint
of
caramel
and
yeast
taste
is
trending
sweet
with
toffee
and
worthers
origional
like
caramelly
goodness
light
grassyness
light
bodied
this
is
a
good
beer
but
not
as
good
as
another
dark
lager
i
just
had
from
the
brother
neighbor
to
the
east
overall
this
was
a
very
nice
alternative
to
all
the
lagers
and
pilsners
of
europe
porters
and
dark
lagers
from
europe
are
getting
better
with
every
one
i
review
that
means
they
can
onle
be
better
across
the
ocean
on
draft
someday
someday
a
thing
all
by

the
czechs

are
for

dark
is
great
for
this

the

compliment
the
coffee

there
is

so
slight

this

middle

about
what

is
lacking

leaves
the
beer
feeling
a
bit
dull

is
a
bit
outside

wheelhouse
and
is
probably
a
beer
i
wouldnt
have
picked
up
on
my
own
but
im
glad
i
got
to
try
it
as
its
a
fairly
solid
offering
a
great
very
drinkable
beer
which
id
love
to
find
again

d
this
is

this
is
one
of
the
better

taste
is
also
very
malty
some
notes
of

feels

overall
this
is
a
good

beer
nazdravi
dark

brown
with
a

dark

and
cocoa
in

with
a
touch
of
noble
hop
sweet
chocolate
and
raisin
with
butterscotch
and
molasses
flavors
light
bodied
with
sharp
fizzy
carbonation
a
pretty
good
dark
lager
with
flavors
that
almost
nudge
it
into
bock
territory
enjoyable
for
what
it
is
but
not
the
same
calibre
as
the
pilsener
a
pretty
good
dark
lager
retaining
the
underlying
czech
bright
pilsner
characteristics
amongst
the
blackened
malt
upgrade
easy
to
drink
and
appropriate
for
this
seasonally
interstitial
period
in
the
beerswilling
continuum
a
very
drinkable
brew
if
you
are
willing
to
try
it
yet
i
would
prefer
a
dark
lager
with
more
hops
dont
get
me
wrong
i
enjoyed
the
regular
zatec
i
just
dont
like
this
beer
because
a
it
is
likely
why
most
nonbas
hate
dark
beer
and
b
its
a
waste
of
their
time
perfecting
the
lightcolored
zatec
should
be
their
priority
you
can
still
drink
it
and
it
has
something
over
average
macro
lagers
etc
d
tasty
goes
down
easily
not
too
filling
mild
kick
very
good
representation
of
style
this
is
a
nice
beer
to
drink
for
a
while
if
youre
in
the
mood
for
the
style
this
beer
kicks
some
major
major
ass
di
wouldnt
go
out
of
my
way
for
it
but
its
nice
enough
full
of
body
and
flavor
this
is
a
solid
choice
for
those
looking
for
something
a
bit
more
meaty
in
a
lager
light
dark
fruit
is
added
in
the
flavor
soft
dark
plum
and
prune
the
malt
gives
it
a
sweetness
like
a
jolly
rancher
candy
but
not
too
powerful
slightly
chewy
on
the
back
end
hops
dont
intrude
much
here
and
being
from
the
czech
rep
i
kind
of
expected
a
bit
more
saaz
but
still
this
is
a
nice
beer
the
mouthfeel
is
about
right
for
this
style
from
the
looks
of
the
bottle
i
was
expecting
something
closer
to
a
schwarzbier
but
this
is
still
a
nice
beer
with
good
flavors
i
could
definitely
enjoy
another
one
really
drinkable
and
enjoyable
overall
quite
a
nice
lager
that
makes
me
look
forward
to
my
upcoming
month
in
prague
a
very
nice
balance
of
malt
and
hop
somewhat
sweet
somewhat
dry
if
not
for
the
relatively
high
abv
this
might
make
a
very
nice
session
beer
hopefully
ill
get
to
try
it
on
tap
sometime
this
summer
expected
a
more
full
flavour
beer
left
a
bitter
after
taste
o
a
little
cheesy
on
the
nose
flavor
is
not
too
bad
and
mouth
feel
is
fine
not
too
bad
overall
overall
unremarkable
not
likely
to
be
purchased
again
would
rather
have
something
else
acceptable
id
order
it
if
i
went
to
a
bar
or
restaurant
that
had
it
this
is
another
beer
that
to
me
would
appeal
to
people
that
are
trying
to
get
away
from
the
typical
bud
light
type
beer
this
to
me
could
be
considered
a
gateway
beer
for
future
rogue
and
stone
drinkers
i
buy
a
can
of
this
once
every
couple
months
because
i
like
dunkels
and
its
one
of
the
two
widely
available
in
ontario
the
other
being
the
markedly
superior
king
dark
lager
so
the
fact
that
im
even
drinking
this
stuff
is
more
a
testament
to
the
neglect
of
this
underrated
style
than
evidence
of
any
real
fondness
for
it
still
until
i
can
get
the
king
more
readily
or
until
another
local
craft
brewery
starts
making
a
dunkel
ill
keep
drinking
this
once
in
a
while
these
beers
are
tricky
to
find
in
alberta
so
im
likely
not
going
to
search
out
this
particular
one
out
overall
its
okay
it
is
very
drinkable
has
no
harsh
aftertaste
and
the
nice
dark
colour
can
make
it
seem
like
youre
drinking
fancy
beer
if
your
friends
are
having
canadian
still
i
wouldnt
have
minded
a
little
more
caramel
or
vanilla
flavour
and
a
heavier
body
d
not
terrible
but
not
very
good
either
i
think
i
made
it
through
6oz
before
i
gave
up
and
moved
on
to
something
better
more
flavorful
than
the
fizzy
yellow
beer
that
is
so
popular
in
ontario
but
only
marginally
so
would
do
in
a
pinch
over
labatt
or
something
but
not
something
id
buy
again
overall
well
it
was
a
little
too
sweet
and
cola
like
in
flavoring
for
me
not
bad
if
that
is
what
you
want
from
a
beer
but
not
something
that
i
personally
really
enjoyed
a
ok
beer
final
thoughts
this
one
has
me
at
a
crossroads
on
the
one
hand
it
has
a
strange
flavor
to
it
that
is
putting
me
off
and
on
the
other
hand
there
really
isnt
anything
outright
bad
about
it
would
i
drink
it
again
no
im
probably
not
even
going
to
finish
the
one
im
drinking
now
o
theres
some
sour
metallic
notes
that
make
this
one
miss
the
mark
in
the
flavour
department
the
flavour
is
just
light
overall
making
this
one
is
quite
easy
to
drink
this
isnt
something
ill
seek
out
pours
a
clean
deep
amber
to
brown
in
color
with
a
light
tan
head
in
the
aroma
lager
like
notes
with
a
note
of
caramel
roast
in
the
taste
a
caramel
like
roast
in
the
beginning
and
the
end
but
in
the
center
of
it
all
is
a
basic
lager
a
small
bite
and
a
medium
to
lighter
bodied
mouthfeel
with
a
small
dry
small
roasty
lager
like
aftertaste
well
it
is
a
basic
dark
lager
overall
a
sub
par
euro
dark
lager
if
this
is
what
its
trying
to
be
unpleasant
aromas
and
bizzare
flavours
make
this
almost
a
drain
pour
disappointed
and
hoping
to
try
a
better
representation
of
the
style
in
the
future
overall
a
pretty
decent
product
from
the
canadian
brewery
a
good
beer
to
either
enjoy
in
mass
quantities
or
with
a
hearty
meal
o
bias
declaration
i
just
dont
see
the
point
of
dark
lagers
either
buy
a
lager
or
buy
an
ale
a
dark
lager
tries
to
be
both
and
ends
up
being
nothing
last
time
i
try
one
urg
what
is
it
with
the
stuff
that
brick
sends
west
both
this
and
the
amber
lager
taste
like
a
buckabeer
with
a
stingy
dose
of
caramel
syrup
stirred
in
not
even
up
to
rickards
reds
oh
so
lofty
standards
uneven
and
unappetizing
actually
like
any
boring
mass
produced
dark
lager
m
the
sensation
is
not
bad
refreshing
as
a
good
lager
and
with
a
lasting
ending
again
nothing
important
going
on
here
not
smooth
changes
between
sweetness
and
bitterness
or
in
between
this
poured
a
dark
brown
with
a
tiny
head
although
it
kept
decent
lacing
throughout
the
glass
the
smell
is
pretty
nonexistent
and
the
taste
is
roasted
malt
some
dark
fruits
cola
nutty
aftertastes
but
not
really
a
lot
of
body
here
sweeter
than
i
would
ideally
like
but
it
drinks
okay
and
i
did
have

with

dont

about
this

availability
yearround
like
a
pale

with
more
sweetness

from
the

on
the
beer
improves
on
this
with
a
lot

not
a

but
it
is
a
nice
one
and
certainly
one
worth
trying
particularly
if
you
can
find
it
ontap
anywhere
overall
not
nearly
as
good
as
most
of
the
beers
i
had
while
in
prague
this
tasted
more
macro
like
not
a
lot
of
care
in
the
lagering
syrup
adjuncts
added
which
brought
fake

tastes
fusel

flavors
despite
the

added

i
hope
the
other
bottles
arent
as
poor
as
this
or
ill
be
very
disappointed
d
this
is
a
pretty
good
beer
and
my
favorite
to
date
of
the
staropramen
lineup
o
a
fine
mediumdark
lager
worth
seeking
out
drinkable
and
pleasant
poltmavy
beer
as
an
european
i
am
slightly
irritated
that
there
is
very
detailed
classification
of
american
beers
on
ba
com
but
clearly
distinct
czech
brews
are
simply
assigned
very
broad
european
styles
as
much
as
i
have
some
reservations
against
staropramen
brewery
i
can
not
deny
it
is
a
well
made
beer
overalla
unique
beer
but
it
doesnt
entirely
come
together
for
me
worth
a
try
though
a
rather
good
dark
lager
interesting
fruit
associations
d
this
is
a
very
nice
beer
ill
buy
it

that
are

not
in
the

way
almost
some
citric
oj
notes
come
through
flavor
is
much
the
same
easy
to
throw
back
on
an
empty

and
entertaining
enough
to
repeat
again
and
again
d
this
is
my
kind
of
lager
im
a
stout
guy
but
id
much
order
this
again
rather
than
try
to
pair
my
bratwurst
with
guinness
drinkability
overall
a
good
beer
not
my
favorite
dark
lager
but
a
good
choice
nonetheless
drinkability
staropramen
has
something
interesting
beers
notning
compares
to
this
i
liked
though
interesting
beer
not
only
worth
a
try

sincerely
recommended
a

overall

an

beer
with

k
polotmave

it
is
overall
a
czech
pils
with
some
roasted
notes
not
very
exciting
pours
a
dark
translucent
gold
color
there
is
a
very
light
smell
which
is
similar
to
regular
staropramen
like
the
classic
lager
the
taste
however
is
much
more
complex
that
most
lagers
it
is
mildly
malty
and
light
on
the
hops
the
thing
that
surprised
me
is
the
layers
which
the
taste
hits
you
very
unexpected
from
a
staropramen
brand
great
overall
for
heavy
drinkers
of
light
sippers
draught
at
the
brewery

some

in

this

bought
this
0
5l
bottle
in
prague
while
visiting
and
drank
it
back
at
home
in
ireland
pours
a
rich
dark
amber
with
a
1
5
finger
head
that
had
a
bit
of
yellowish
to
it
but
was
basically
white
and
it
disappeared
slowly
into
a
decent
lace
that
stuck
around
throughout
the
drink
the
smell
was
great
malty
hints
and
some
light
floral
fruity
hints
the
taste
is
exactly
what
you
would
expect
from
the
smell
and
was
very
smooth
going
down
with
more
and
more
light
fruity
sugary
notes
coming
through
as
it
warmed
up
not
a
strong
or
harsh
beer
that
went
down
great
and
something
i
could
drink
all
day
longwish
it
was
more
available
this
one
was
served
cold
but
others
were
cellar
temp
and
a
bit
better
in
the
flavor
one
of
the
best
darks
from
the
czech
republic
recommended
a
quite
nice
dark
lager
this
is
hardly
going
to
be
a
contender
for
the
greatest
dark
beer
award
however
the
brew
has
its
merrits
and
although
the
first
feel
was
a
bit
odd
i
actually
began
to
enjoy
it

the
taste

the

this

this

it

pours
a
healthy
clear

much
like
a

but
with
almost
no
head
whatsoever
also
like
a
cola
the
nose
was
mildly

kind
of
like
a
cola
while
the
mouth
was
prickly
sweet
well
um
kind
of
like
a

doesnt
taste
like
a
cola
however
theres
a
touch
of
sour
too
close
to
the
best
before
date
to
go
with
the

theres
not

follow
through
at

there

even
some

its
a
bit
on

light
side
in
the
flavor
and
feel
though
all
in
all
this
is
a
pretty
decent
dark
lager
when
drinking
it
it
took
me
back
into
what
it
must
of
been
like
drinking
beer
back
in
the
good
ol
days
of
czech
poland
hungary
austria
before
the
turn
of
the
century
the
first
thing
that
meet
you
is
a
big
smell
of
raisins
which
combines
together
with
a
slight
touch
of
coffee
the
taste
isnt
so
big
unfortunately
its
fruity
and
reminds
a
bit
of
porters
its
semisweet
and
not
bitter
at
all
quite
easy
to
drink
overall
i
cant
say
im
disappointed
because
i
didnt
expect
much
at
all
but
its
definately
worth
trying
out
pretty
poor

from

falls
between
a
dry

and
english
stout
sweet
and

sickly

to
the
sweetness
like

not
roasty
enough
for

not

id
take
it

not

still
an
interesting

on
i
suppose
a

i
would
drink
this
again
o
a
little

goes
down
easily
not
too
filling
decent
kick
good
representation
of

this
is
a
decent
beer
to
drink
for
a
while
if
youre
in
the
mood
for
the
style
fairly
complex
malt
character
the
diacetyl
complements
the
chocolate
well
probably
cloyingly
sweet
to
some
i
enjoy
the
indulgence
overall
this
is
an
extremely
flavorful
beer
with
a
fantastic
mouthfeel
lots
of
dark
fruits
balanced
out
with
a
cocoa
finish
a
very
soild
beer
the
taste
begins
sweet
with
coffee
and
chocolate
along
with
a
kind
of
black
licorice
note
there
is
a
thin
bitterness
at
first
but
it
tends
to
grow
as
i
drink
the
beer
although
it
never
takes
over
the
beer
pours
dark
brown
with
a
slight
off
white
head
that
instantly
recedes
aroma
leads
with
some
figs
and
caramel
underneath
theres
some
roastiness
with
a
little
earthiness
flavor
offers
a
nice
dose
of
figs
and
raisins
caramel
a
lttle
chocolate
and
closes

with

roasted

grinds
not
very
delicate
more
heavy

fuller

overall
solid
beer
here
better
than
i
went
in
expecting
it
to
be
rjt
overall
a
good
example
of
the
style
its
kind
of
like
a
lageryeasted
porter
something
about
which
i
cant
complain
this
dark
lager
bock
whichever
has
a
nice
flavor
of
malt
which
does
seem
roasty
with
some
fruity
raisin
and
mild
herbal
hops
adding
to
the
woodiness
and
cocoa
flavors
from
the
chocolate
malt
and
crystal
type
malts
i
am
guessing
the
yeast
has
a
subtle
berry
aspect
which
adds
to
the
creamy
sweet
flavor
of
the
malt
which
works
well
with
the
lager
smoothness
the
flavor
is
roast
ier
as
it
warms
bringing
an
almost
burnt
marshmallow
type
caramel
flavor
in
the
finish
overall
i
am
a
fan
of
this
style
and
this
is
one
of
the
better
examples
bock
as
full
sail
calls
it
i
like
the
enhanced
roast
as
it
adds
to
the
complexity
of
some
of
the
caramel
malts
utilized
poured
into
a
dogfish
head
pint

pours
a
very
dark

with

pleasant
the
flavor
here
is
fairly
rich
and
porterlike
in
a
blind
taste
id
probably
identify
this
as
a
baltic
porter
flavor
is
full
and
interesting
and
a
quite
nice
mouth
feel
probably
the
best
and
my
favorite
from
this
series
taste
gets
a
few
more
things
going
some
toast
licorice
and
some
vegetal
earthiness
cocoa
is
still
there
drier
than
it
smelled
not
much
sweetness
here
mouthfeel
is
fairly
full
for
an
edl
more
bockish
if
you
axe
me
not
bad
a
solid
addition
to
the
enjoyable
ltd
series
i
try
and
buy
a
sixer
each
time
i
see
a
new
one
this
beer
would
be
better
if
the
tanginess
could
be
reduced
and
the
head
retention
improved
its
drinkable
but
nothing
to
write
home
about
overall
okay

one
perhaps
too
multidirectional
a
worth

experiment
but
slightly
over
done

beer
certainly
worth
a
try
the
label
says
i
will
think
coffee
and
chocolate
not
sold
really
nice
richer
looking
dark
brown
color
and
some
patchy
just
off
white
lace
on
it
a
nose
of
lager
yeast
must
and
roasted
barley
rather
simple
but
fully
appetizing
the
taste
is
also
straight
forward
there
is
indeed
some
chocolate
here
a
mix
of
cocoa
powder
and
hershey
bar
not
sweet
but
only
because
its
a
lager
and
the
long
slow
cold
fermentation
tames
it
bitter
on
the
back
end
like
a
cup
of
drip
but
its
from
the
barley
clearly
i
do
like
the
feel
a
lot
with
a
slightly
fuller
body
and
a
dusty
almost
chalky
palate
still
with
nice
carbonation
the
dark
malt
is
awesome
simple
and
clean
which
is
just
right
what
i
do
not
like
is
its
semigimmicky
mix
of
flavors
its
filling
qualities
and
its
odd
mix
of
bitter
and
sweet
its
good
not
great
at
7
abv
i
dont
need
more
than
one
but
i
am
glad
i
tried
it
when
full
sail
first
hit
the
scene
it
was
magic
since
then
even
in
this
ltd
series
its
been
lackluster
the
verdict
delicious
tastes
like
a
cross
between
an
irish
stout
and
kona
pipeline
porter
complex
brew
with
enough
coffee
and
chocolate
flavor
to
make
you
accuse
the

of
lying
the
alcohol
is

hidden
too

some

notes
a
little
caramel
that
shows
up
more
as
the
beer
warms
thick
and
heavy
in
the
mouth
but
still
ridiculously
easy
to
drink
sweet
up
front
a
little
nutty
tons
of
chocolate
and
a
little
coffee
roasty
finish
makes
you
want
to
take
another
drink
absolutely
fantastic
a
constant
in
my
fridge
as
long
as
its
available
this
is
a
smooth
drinking
dark
winter
treat
would
pair
well
with
both
hearty
meals
or
deserts
or
just
drink
it
as
your
desert
what
it
lacks
in
head
and
nose
it
more
than
makes
up
for
with
flavor
and
mouthfeel
full
sail
remains
one
of
the
best
values
in
craft
beer
this
ltd
series
is
amazingly
complex
and
an
awesome
value
essence
of
chocolateat
the
beginning
with
a
clean
coffee
finish
definitely
get
coffee
in
both
the
nose
and
appearance
inviting
and
delicious
alcohol
is
well
hidden
in
this
one
much
more
complex
than
your
average
dark
lager
amazingly
the
alcohol
was
almost
completely
hidden
here
as
i
didnt
feel
it
all
during
the
time
i
enjoyed
this
while
this
was
not
a
knockout
i
was
really
impressed
by
how
daring
and
unique
this
was
and
this
was
certainly
worthy
of
the
ltd
and
the
boastful
claims
on
the
bottle
fine
on
its
own
or
as
a
dessert
beer
this
deserves
a
go
and
higher
ratings
than
what
it
currently
has
on
here
i
love
beers
that
push
the
envelope
of
whats
possible
and
this
certainly
fell
within
that
category
and
theres
no
doubt
that
this
deserves
a
bigger
audience
and
higher
ratings
than
what
it
currently
has
on
here
worth
a
purchase
if
you
see
one
o
this
is
a
nice
7
dark
lager
i
continue
to
be
impressed
with
these
guys
o
theres
really
no
coffee
and
chocolate
in
this
keep
making
more
please
in
my
opinion
its
a
wellcrafted
beer
its
among
the
better
american
bockstyle
beers
ive
had
overall
an
interesting
beer
i
would
almost
call
this
a
true
baltic
porter
the
style
that
used
to
be
made
lots
of
dark
malt
flavors
cocoa
little
coffee
caramel
light
black
malt
very
little
bitterness
all
that
with
the
crispness
of
a
lager
the
way
baltic
porter
used
to
be
before
people
started
calling
anything
a
baltic
porter
the
very
light
burnt
flavor
from
the
black
malt
might
be
the
only
issue
with
this
beer
and
it
is
light
the
booze
does
feel
a
little
stronger
than
it
should
due
to
the
soft
lager
feel
but
i
like
it
if
i
think
of
this
as
a
baltic
porter
its
right
where
it
should
be
i
think
poured
into
a
pint
glass
this
brew
has
basically
no
headwhat
is
there
is
tan
clear
and
black
with
ruby
highlights
when
held
up
to
the
light
aromas
of
chocolately
malt
is
dominant
holiday
spices
also
heremostly
remniscent
of
nutmeg
a
really
nice
taste
like
the
aroma
milk
chocolate
malt
nutmeg
and
a
bit
of
cinnamon
along
with
a
fair
amount
of
sweetness
present
just
a
hint
of
bitterness
in
the
aftertaste
really
easy
to
drink
hard
to
believe
this
is
7
medium
bodied
and
carbonatedsmooth
and
slightly
velvetlike
in
mouthfeel
pleasantly
surprised
by
this
beer
very
solid
nice
work
o
a
conundrum
here
tip
my
hat
to
full
sail
for
making
a
lager
with
such
flavor
and
complexity
but
still
i
wish
it
was
richer
and
smoother
it
has
typical
lager
carbonation
and
characteristics
and
is
a
bit
offputting
with
the
real
darkness
of
this
one
odpleasantly
surprised
here
a
porter
made
with
lager
yeast
essentially
i
love
porters
and
therefore
i
liked
this
one
quite
a
bit
definitely
a
cool
beer
to
try
at
least
once
overall
good
beer
but
its
not
really
doing
it
for
me
its
basically
a
porter
in
a
lager
body
no
problem
drinking
it
but
i
probably
wouldnt
buy
it
again
if
only
because
id
rather
have
an
actual
porter
or
stout
in
its
stead
o
good
brew
but
full
sail
has
a
tendancy
to
brew
good
beers
glad
i
picked
this
up
not
usually
a
lager
fan
but
i
am
a
sucker
for
roasty
chewy
beers
that
dont
taste
like
sulfur
one
of
my
least
favorite
lager
characteriatics
overall
an
easy
drinker
with
some
decent
dark
flavours
going
on
drank
a
few
of
these
in
the
hot
tub
on
some
snowy
evenings
at
the
cabin
over
the
christmas
break
perfect
for
that
venue
o
wow
this
is
excellent
it
is
super
creamy
smooth
and
drinkable
has
favorable
elements
from
a
typical
good
brown
ale
and
also
porterish
roasted
malt
great
combination
excellent
complexity
and
it
goes
down
easy
to
boot
taste
is
quite
full
for
a
lager
yet
without
the
sweet
malt
profile
one
might
expect
from
a
bock
more
light
roast
chocolate
and
a
bit
of
dark
fruit
in
the
background
hops
not
so
present
on
the
taste
offers
a
nice
carbonation
for
the
pour
which
gives
a
lingering
malt
finish
full
body
with
a
smooth
and
easy
drinkability
interesting
brew
and
tough
to
pinpoint
as
for
stylecomparison
though
ive
had
plenty
of
worse
porters
along
the
way
a
tasty
dark
lager
the
flavors
of
a
stout
in
a
lager
overall
this
is
considered
a
lager
it
has
an
earthy
grainy
texture
and
feel
i
like
the
fact
people
are
experimenting
with
ingredients
and
i
appreciate
the
effort
but
i
resent
the
lager
labelling
it
definitely
seems
more
of
a
porter
or
a
stout
and
i
desire
to
label
it
as
so
but
it
is
a
decent
drink
and
i
can
handle
a
few
more
of
these
but
i
just
wish
it
were
labelled
correctly
so
i
could
understand
whats
next
up
on
my
list
a
great
brew
in
the
end
decent
but
not
special
i
guess
for
a
lager
you
could
almost
say
its
pretty
good
i
doubt
ill
have
it
again
worth
a
try
if
you
are
a
ticker
i
guess
overall
i
enjoyed
this
twist
on
a
christmas
time
beer
a
straightforward
lager
with
a
very
good
taste
o
probably
the
best
ltd
offering
i
can
remember
from
full
sail
at
7
a
sixer
this
offering
is
a
steal
4s
across
the
board
a
real
nice
beer
this
is
a
very
high
quality
lager
i
am
very
impressed
at
the
unique
flavor
i
would
reccomend
this
highly
as
one
of
the
best
seasonal
lagers
produced
here
in
the
united
states
the
chocolate
stands
out
more
than
any
other
flavor
to
me
the
flavor
is
breadier
than
the
nose
describes
i
liked
this
one
the
euro
dark
lager
style
can
be
ho
hum
but
this
one
shines
through
ive
been
impressed
with
all
the
ltd
series
d
euro
dark
lager
thought
it
was
a
doppelbock
pours
coffee
black
slight
ring
of
brown
around
the
edges
small
beige
head
dissipates
relatively
quickly
the
aroma
is
coffee
chocolate
and
a
sweet
clean
malt
sweetness
unfortunately
that
sweetness
tends
a
bit
toward
the
somewhat
sickly
flavor
of
strong
lagers
it
doesnt
spoil
the
beer
or
anything
but
the
note
makes
me
kinda
wish
that
it
was
an
ale
the
flavor
is
quite
nice
its
a
stoutish
dunkler
bock
fairly
sweet
more
caramel
in
the
taste
though
theres
some
chocolate
throughout
and
plenty
of
roast
in
the
finish
pretty
full
bodied
nice
round
feel
finish
feels
a
bit
too
sticky
no
noticeable
booziness
interesting
beer
i
liked
it
more
than
expected
id
be
curious
to
try
the
same
recipe
made
with
a
clean
ale
yeast
overall
this
is
a
very
drinkable
dark
lager
that
has
a
nice
balanced
flavor
and
is
also
refreshing
definitely
worth
trying
this
o
its
a
very
nice
stoutlike
beer
even
though
it
says
euro
dark
lager
semantics
perhaps
flavorful
and
refreshing
t
gotta
say
i
wasnt
a
huge
fan
of
the
other
ltd
beers
but
this
one
is
pretty
solid
some
chocolate
upfront
with
a
hint
of
roasted
malt
a
touch
of
dark
roasted
coffee
and
burnt
malt
on
the
finish
pretty
nice
and
smooth
definitely
worth
a
try
i
have
to
score
this
one
high
since
this
euro
dark
category
is
such
a
catchall
of
a
lot
of
really
mediocre
stuff
from
the
bottle
in
the
sixpack
bought
at
mayfair
liquor
in
denver
the
flavor
becomes
more
enjoyable
as
it
warms
initially
i
was
put
off
by
the
harsh
roasty
notes
but
they
start
to
mellow
out
as
this
brew
sits
longer
the
carbonation
is
spoton
and
in
spite
of
the
slightly
stale
coffee
flavor
that
comes
across
i
found
this
overall
to
be
much
more
pleasing
and
enjoyable
than
i
had
initially
expected
for
the
price
id
have
another
a
well
done
lager
easy
drinking
a
good
winter
beer
pretty
good
and
a
fun
departure
for
the
season
with
the
ltd
lineup
it
isnt
perfectly
suited
for
my
tastes
but
its
not
bad
either
if
you
like
session
black
youll
probably
like
this
too

overall
an
excellent

best
of
the

an
almost
opaque
super
dark

with
a
foamy

that

an
oily

of
the
beer
foamy
rings
of

the

on

down
smell
is
of
dark
roasted

and
some
slight
cocoa
and
coffee

taste
is
much
the
same
with
a
mild
roasty
bitterness
on
the
palate
with
each
sip
this
beer
has
a
lower
level
of
carbonation
with
a
slightly
crisp
and
medium
bodied
mouthfeel
overall
this
is
a
good
beer
that
is
tasty
and
easy
to
drink
o
impressive
lager
ive
heard
it
described
as
a
czech
dark
and
now
a
doppelbock
whatever
the
case
this
is
pretty
good
for
a
lager
and
just
like
the
6pack
holder
states
there
are
nice
notes
of
chocolate
and
coffee
throughout
my
kind
of
beer
picked
up
a
sixer
of
this
for
5
score
the
label
mentions
chocolate
but
i
would
not
go
that
far
dark
black
color
decent
head
smells
roasty
dark
malts
flavor
is
more
of
the
same
very
dark
malts
this
is
a
good
lager
not
sure
what
style
it
would
be
because
im
pretty
much
a
novice
at
drinking
lager
beers
i
would
definitely
buy
another
one
of
these
for
5
that
was
a
fucking
steal
a
nice
sixpack
surprise
from
full
sail
with
their
ltd
series
pretty
nice
overall
if
a
bit
too
carbonated
dark
roasted
flavors
are
a
highlight
worth
checking
out
an
alright
dopplebock
nothing
too
exciting
but
a
decent
entre
to
the
style
a
nice
dry
light
chocolate
taste
well
done
edit
the
message
under
the
bright
orange
cap
says
live
the
dream
nice
transparent
red
colour
smell
of
roasted
corn
not
very
pleasant
taste
medium
bitter
average
not
very
exciting
this
beer
poured
out
as
a
nice
looking
brown
color
the
head
was
big
and
fluffy
the
lacing
was
pretty
good
down
the
glass
the
smell
of
the
beer
was
roasts
and
had
a
bit
of
smoke
on
the
nose
as
well
the
taste
of
the
beer
was
a
lot
like
a
porter
its
roasted
and
has
a
slight
sweetness
to
it
the
mouthfeel
was
a
little
lighter
than
expected
but
still
not
bad
overall
the
beer
was
fun
to
try
and
i
enjoyed
it
d
i
have
had
other
polish
beers
that
have
impressed
me
this
beer
is
a
resounding
meh
d
goes
down
relatively
easy
decent
representation
of
style
based
off
the
nose
and
tastes
i
would
have
preferred
a
touch
heavier
body
but
a
decent
beer
nontheless
drinkability
again
this
is
much
dark
than
i
expected
and
i
really
liked
it
drinkability
i
really
like
this
beer
there
is
a
nice
smokiness
to
this
that
is
not
overpowering
with
the
low
abv
i
could
sip
the
four
pack
in
a
sitting
i
liked
this
quite
a
bit
i
was
expecting
a
fairly
average
tasting
beer
and
this
was
rather
enjoyable
something
id
go
back
again
after
having
a
single
of
and
seek
out
a
six
pack
to
purchase
the
next
time
im
in
the
mood
for
something
like
this
definitely
worth
a
try
poured
from
a
22oz
bomber
into
a
beer
mug
a
deep
reddish
brown
clour
with
a
quickly
dissipating
head
tastes
of
caramel
and
toffee
all
the
way
a
strong
malt
presence
can
be
felt
in
the
first
sip
sweet
with
burnt
sugar
almost
too
much
for
a
euro
dark
lager
mouthfeel
is
thin
and
pretty
above
average
on
the
sting
i
would
pass
this
as
average
on
drinkability
because
of
its
sweetness
not
a
match
for
the
porter
but
few
brews
are
shoot
for
the
price
this
is
a
great
beer
d
the
clean
and
toasted
flavors
are
nice
but
they
are
hidden
in
the
background
this
makes
me
drink
even
faster
to
try
and
get
more
of
that
taste
that
is
eluding
my
tongue
drinkability
is
good
enough
to
finish
the
bottle
but
not
good
enough
to
wish
i
had
another
one
really
enjoyed
this
one
it
poured
a
very
dark
brown
almost
black
with
a
slightly
off
white
head
about
a
finger
and
a
half
a
really
nice
looking
beer
and
a
neat
looking
bottle
by
the
way
smelled
nice
sort
of
a
burnt
chocolate
smell
the
taste
was
what
you
would
expect
from
the
smell
sort
of
a
burnt
chocolate
with
just
a
hint
of
bitterness
behind
it
maybe
a
burnt
bitter
chocolate
really
i
expect
it
really
is
derived
from
their
porter
to
me
it
tastes
like
a
porter
it
reminded
me
a
lot
of
sierra
nevadas
porter
if
the
bottle
has
said
porter
it
would
have
been
an
excellent
representation
of
the
style
medium
carbonation
felt
just
about
right
a
couple
would
be
enough
due
to
the
style
i
really
enjoyed
it
though
would
hightly
recommend
it
and
im
hoping
they
still
have
some
in
stock
when
i
get
back
to
the
store
drinkability
is
pretty
solid
for
what
it
is
as
a
euro
dark
lager
this
is
one
of
the
better
beers
ive
had
in
quite
some
time
and
by
far
the
best
out
of
my
polish
beer
kick
definitely
worth
picking
up
more
in
the
future
to
me
this
is
more
of
a
schwarzbier
than
a
bp
due
to
abv
thickness
and
strength
of
flavor
as
the
latter
this
would
be
among
my
favorites
but
as
a
baltic
porter
it
lacks
both
punch
and
character
dark
tawny
amber
with
a
nice
whipped
mocha
head
that
leaves
sliding
globs
of
lace
down
the
glass
smell
is
pretty
mild
faint
toasted
cereal
grain
and
dark
malts
tastes
of
semisweet
chocolate
and
dark
fruit
that
is
perfectly
balanced
with
bittering
hops
light
bodied
and
well
carbonated
a
nice
session
beer
it
reminded
me
of
a
schwarze
bier
in
its
soft
malty
character
which
made
it
very
easy
drinking
overall
i
was
expecting
more
of
a
roasted
flavor
which
was
rather
subdued
overall
this
is
not
something
i
plan
on
drinking
again
granted
it
was
a
free
bottle
that
i
received
due
to
an
error
but
that
still
doesnt
make
it
a
good
beer
ill
stick
with
okocims
exceptional
porter
thank
you
very
much
overall
this
was
a
decent
baltic
porter
but
much
to
light
for
my
liking
this
is
a
pitch
black
red
hued
beer
with
a
prolific
slowly
receding
thick
tan
head
multilayers
of
sticky
spotty
lace
cling
to
the
pint
glass
right
above
a
good
12
finger
covering
of
froth
which
doesnt
go
away
until
a
drink
is
taken
strong
and
sweet
malt
aromas
float
to
the
nose
and
envelop
notes
of
butter
coffee
and
slight
medicinals
has
a
medium
to
fullbodied
mouthfeel
with
a
small
amount
of
viscosity
the
palate
involves
some
spicy
alcohol
up
front
with
some
more
sweet
malts
and
a
hop
hit
at
the
end
for
balance
not
as
portery
as
expected
but
still
a
good
drinker
that
has
its
own
character
to
make
up
for
its
shortcomings
in
the
taste
department
excellent
porter
seems
a
little
light
to
be
labeled
a
baltic
but
very
good
nonetheless
this
is
good
stuff
a
beer
with
baltic
porter
flavors
but
an
even
higher
drinkability
very
nice
beer
i
could
see
buying
a
four
pack
of
this
in
the
future
for
some
sessioning
drinkability
were
it
not
so
sweet
this
would
be
a
very
nice
beer
as
it
stands
it
is
decent
and
flavorful
just
not
a
style
that
i
would
seek
out
every
day
or
many
days
for
that
matter
clear
dark
mahoganycolored
reddishbrown
with
a
moderately
large
light
tan
head
smokey
nose
with
deeply
caramelized
molassesy
and
slightly
burnt
grainy
aromas
full
thick
chewy
mouth
feel
full
malty
flavor
with
lots
of
molasses
and
smoke
up
front
fading
to
mostly
molasses
with
a
hint
of
burnt
chocolate
malt
in
the
finish
rather
sweet
with
no
obvious
hops
at
all
just
enough
to
provide
counterbalance
to
the
ample
malt
leaves
a
smokey
aftertaste
somewhat
similar
to
a
german
rauchbier
tho
not
as
intensely
smokey
and
caramelized
rather
like
a
baltic
porter
too
has
the
fullness
and
intense
toasted
malt
character
overall
very
interesting
but
not
necessarily
outstanding
a
little
on
the
sweet
side
for
me
d
palone
doesnt
live
up
to
the
original
okocim
but
still
a
good
beer
might
well
serve
as
a
sessionable
substitute
for
its
bigger
brother
id
drink
more
of
this
if
i
had
more
than
one
bottle
drinkability
is
incredible
even
though
ive
only
had
just
this
one
bottle
i
could
drink
these
all
day
great
price
not
that
heavy
or
strong
ridiculously
good
apparently
this
is
firebrewed
and
tastes
like
it
a
very
smoky
touch
to
it
which
i
personally
thinks
works
great
almost
remind
me
of
a
scotch
ale
with
the
smokiness
to
it
all
in
all
it
works
well
and
makes
for
a
tasty
smooth
beer
poured
from
a
500ml
bottle
it
pours
well
with
a
creamy
head
nice
dark
amber
color
smells
like
caramel
malt
not
too
aromatic
but
enough
to
peak
my
interest
tastes
a
little
weak
but
with
the
same
sweet
caramel
malt
as
the
smell
i
expected
more
of
a
roastier
flavor
being
that
it
is
firebrewed
but
it
isnt
bad
drink
well
with
soft
aftertaste
off
of
the
tongue
i
probably
wont
drink
it
again
but
it
was
an
okay
find
overall
in
comparison
to
their
porter
this
is
much
more
sessionable
but
still
keeps
the
delicious
flavors
very
nice
i
would
buy
again
for
sure
d
i
got
this
at
discount
liquor
in
milwaukee
whatever
style
this
beer
is
it
is
damn
good
nice
low
abv
aids
drinkability
i
would
not
session
this
because
of
the
smokiness
and
burnt
bitterness
okocims
lighter
sibling
compared
to
its
8
1
abv
porter
is
an
easy
beer
to
get
familiar
with
i
could
see
myself
at
a
campfire
roasting
marshmallows
with
this
beer
in
hand
a
polish
beer
its
a
first
for
me
too
out
of
the
bomber
this
brew
was
a
dark
woodstain
brown
color
with
a
fizzy
khaki
head
no
visible
carbonation
little
retention
it
looked
almost
exactly
like
a
root
beer
and
little
lacing
aromas
of
toasted
malt
and
grain
with
horseblanket
mustiness
classically
what
one
would
expect
from
a
baltic
porter
well
balanced
flavors
of
sweet
malts
roasted
malts
and
hops
with
a
long
smoky
finish
medium
body
and
light
to
medium
carbonation
the
fizziness
is
again
present
in
the
mouthfeel
nothing
remarkable
but
straight
up
a
fine
brew
extra
apperance
points
for
the
super
cool
logo
on
the
bottle
pours
a
nice
deep
ruby
with
a
large
off
white
head
moderate
lacing
awesome
nose
a
great
purpley
granity
aroma
the
same
that
i
love
in
sam
smiths
it
smells
a
little
figgy
caramely
and
sweet
and
tastes
the
same
way
figs
caramel
you
have
to
like
a
sweet
beer
to
like
this
one
but
as
i
come
back
the
simplicity
and
granity
taste
make
this
one
a
winner
it
rolls
across
the
tongue
to
a
smooth
finish
and
i
could
easily
drink
this
all
night
long
only
the
sweetness
keeps
this
from
a
perfect
score
in
the
dark
lager
or
doppellbock
category
no
similarity
to
a
synbrnchoff
okocim
or
zyweic
porters
i
bought
this
beer
looking
for
eastern
european
porter
and
got
something
totally
different
and
totally
delicious
flavor
is
pleasant
and
unified
certainly
sweeter
and
lighter
than
i
had
expected
for
a
baltic
porter
i
dont
think
this
should
be
in
the
baltic
porter
category
more
like
a
very
well
done
dark
euro
lager
that
said
this
is
quite
tasty
and
easy
to
drink
a
nice
session
or
crossover
beer
a
very
flavorful
brew
very
balanced
and
easy
to
drink
good
job
okocim
d
a
pleasant
drinker
easy
to
consume
there
are
no
real
standout
qualities
but
still
its
a
solid
choice
one
im
glad
to
have
tried
and
one
id
snag
again
without
much
armtwisting
this
is
a
dunkel
not
a
baltic
porter
as
the
page
suggests
it
pours
a
nice
clear
brown
with
a
small
soft
tan
head
there
is
a
great
caramel
malt
aroma
it
has
a
nice
sweet
subtle
nuttiness
in
the
flavor
possibly
with
a
little
vanilla
the
mouthfeel
is
about
what
youd
expect
from
a
dunkel
it
finishes
very
nicely
and
leaves
a
little
sweetness
on
your
palate
overall
its
an
enjoyable
easydrinking
beer
drinkability
because
of
the
wateriness
i
dont
feel
like
this
is
very
filling
so
i
could
probably
drink
a
few
but
because
of
the
strange
taste
i
might
not
want
to
still
pretty
good
drinkability
is
good
not
the
best
porter
ive
had
but
a
nice
variation
a
bit
watery
not
what
i
was
expecting
from
a
baltic
porter
but
softly
carbonated
and
very
drinkable
d
im
totally
disappointed
this
is
listed
on
this
site
as
a
baltic
porter
but
i
totally
disagree
with
that
classification
i
feel
that
this
is
more
of
a
roasted
euro
dark
lager
or
something
og
that
sort
it
has
more
in
common
with
a
munich
dunkel
than
it
does
with
a
baltic
porter
where
is
the
big
heavy
body
the
high
abv
the
chocolate
and
roasted
grains
this
isnt
terrible
but
its
far
from
good
very
tasty
not
as
good
as
the
original
okocim
porter
it
tastes
sugary
and
sweet
there
is
a
faint
hoppy
or
bitterness
in
the
finish
of
the
drink
in
the
mouth
is
pretty
thin
this
to
me
could
almost
be
a
session
beer
dark
style
smell
reminds
me
of
an
herbal
root
tea
very
earthy
taste
has
that
too
but
gets
covered
by
the
roasted
malt
flavors
a
rubyish
dark
red
porter
highly
carbonated
thicker
syrupy
mouthfeel
finishes
pretty
well
with
that
same
herbal
root
tea
taste
a
very
unique
beer
would
like
to
see
the
brewing
process
on
this
one
pours
a
five
finger
light
tan
head
that
fades
slowly
leaving
some
lace

easily
sessionable
the
sweet

might
turn

off
but
i
think
this
is
a
very
good
beer
really
great
to
try
and
even
better
to
keep
as
a
regular

well
final
verdict
too
watery
too
sweet
too
awkward
and
too
unbalanced
for
my
liking
but
not
so
awful
its
undrinkable
the
flavour
is
there
its
just
not
executed
that
well
recommended
id
still
take
their
normal
porter
over
this
most
any
day
but
this
is
a
solid
beer
the
mouthfeel
stays
with
this
for
ever
silk
crushed
velet
between
your
toes
good
the
brown
tilted
amber
has
a
nice
head
that
wish
would
have
stayed
around
longer
it
smells
of
a
sweet
malta
type
drink
with
a
bock
swager
good
but
different
taste
of
a
sweet
dark
larger
with
a
good
bit
of
rounding
out
of
flavors
i
have
come
to
know
as
a
baltic
dark
lager
with
a
kiss
of
smokiness
this
is
a
damn
good
beer
and
an
all
day
drinker
for
sure
poured
from
the
500ml
bottle
into
a
pint
glass
color
is
somewhere
between
amber
and
burgundy
topped
by
a
smallish
light
tan
head
that
is
rather
shortlived
aroma
of
sweet
roasted
malt
with
notes
of
caramel
and
toffee
and
a
hint
of
peat
smoke
palate
is
again
dominated
by
sweet
malt
a
touch
of
roastiness
and
sweet
caramel
and
light
fruit
finish
is
actually
fairly
dry
and
ends
with
a
touch
of
peat
smoke
the
body
is
rich
enough
to
handle
the
sweet
flavors
here
with
a
slight
velvety
character
very
nice
a
wellbuilt
dark
lager
a
pretty
nice
brew
pleasantly
surprised
easy
to
drink
satisfying
and
slick
recommended
dan
above
average
dark
lager
the
mouthfeel
and
look
of
this
beer
are
excellent
i
will
be
picking
this
up
again
but
overall
it
is
a
solid
beer
i
do
think
the
beer
loses
something
in
its
downsizing
a
baltic
porter
should
be
big
and
uncompromising
and
this
beer
aint
really
it
tastes
like
a
5050
mix
of
their
ok
beer
and
their
baltic
porter
both
very
good
beers
in
their
own
right
but
this
combination
is
good
but
id
rather
keep
those
brews
separate
drinkability
i
drank
it
slow
but
it
was
decent
d
quite
drinkable
nice
pleasant
to
drink
beer
here
that
i
think
could
just
as
easy
be
classified
as
a
schwartzbier
a
little
too
sweet
i
think
but
still
not
a
bad
beer
and
one
i
would
drink
again
palone
is
nowhere
near
the
excellence
of
okocim
porter
but
then
i
didnt
expect
it
to
be
its
probably
my
second
favorite
euro
dark
lager
behind
podkovan
dark
a
czechoslovakian
beer
that
defines
the
style
as
far
as
im
concerned
i
love
the
bottles
and
the
labels
that
browar
okocim
has
chosen
thankfully
the
beer
aint
too
shabby
either
this
is
a
very
nice
looking
beer
i
had
a
pint
bottle
but
only
an
oz
schooner
glass
so
i
had
two
pours
there
was
a
nice
creamy
head
but
it
didnt
last
long
the
colour
is
like
a
deep
coca
cola
garnet
the
aroma
was
faint
but
a
bit
smokey
and
a
little
sweet
the
flavour
was
interesting
and
kinda
like
a
smokey
chinese
bbq
sauce
its
a
bit
sweet
and
some
more
hops
might
offset
this
for
better
balance
but
overall
its
an
interesting
and
drinkable
brew
its
also
a
medium
body
beer
which
is
deceptive
after
initial
inspection
it
would
be
great
with
kransky
or
some
other
polish
sausage
pity
im
a
vego
okocim
palone
was
found
at
binnys
in
river
grove
il
a
tasty
easydrinking
brew
dark
malt
with
a
mild
progressive
smokiness
easy
to
drink
but
quite
forgettable
would
pair
well
as
a
background
beer
with
ribs
or
barbeque
a
good
beer
one
will
have
no
problem
drinking
this
half
liter
bottle
my
glass
is
already
half
empty
after
this
review
picked
up
a
4
pack
of
16
9
ozers
for
less
than
seven
bucks
id
say
i
got
my
moneys
worth
maybe
not
quite
what
i
was
expecting
from
a
beer
from
okocim
but
worthwhile
found
at
eagle
provisions
nyc
very
decent
for
its
style
it
has
a
decent
dark
appearance
and
malty
aroma
quite
drinkable
nicely
malted
not
sweet
balanced
with
some
moderate
bitterness
a
bit
of
smoke
in
taste
and
average
mouthfeel
i
taste
caramel
poured
into
an
imperial
pint
glass
a
dark
translucent
brown
with
half
an
inch
of
tan
foam
that
dissipates
quickly
aroma
was
roasted
sweet
smokey
malts
tastes
of
sweet
raisin
caramel
malt
and
semisweet
chocolate
all
with
a
slightly
smokey
overtone
crisp
with
medium
carbonation
this
was
very
tasty
and
not
as
smokey
as
i
thought
it
would
be
very
subtle
smokiness
which
is
just
what
i
was
looking
for
i
would
search
this
one
out
again
palone
pours
a
dark
brown
almost
black
with
only
the
slightest
amount
of
ruby
at
the
edges
and
an
off
white
head
from
a
brown
500
ml
bottle
the
aroma
is
kind
of
odd
almost
woody
there
is
a
smoky
malt
taste
that
predominates
tasty
definitely
worth
a
try
i
love
the
whole
fire
brewed
marketing
a
nice
contrast
to
the
ice
brewed
craze
of
the
90s
in
the
us
and
canada
recommended
i
was
excited
to
try
this
as
i
loved
the
zywiec
porter
it
poured
a
brownish
black
color
with
a
one
finger
tan
head
smell
was
intensely
sweet
alcohol
soaked
fruit
and
honey
flavor
was
much
of
the
same
with
a
smoky
overtone
to
everything
and
big
sweetness
predominantly
honey
i
wasnt
too
fond
of
the
combination
of
smokiness
with
fruit
this
is
a
unique
brew
therefore
i
couldnt
give
it
a
bad
rating
but
i
couldnt
drink
too
many
of
these
the
appearance
is
dark
brown
with
a
small
tan
head
the
flavor
is
like
the
aroma
and
is
moderately
bitter
the
palate
is
thin
and
the
aftertaste
is
sweet
toasted
malt
and
chocolate
light
aroma
of
roasted
and
burnt
malts
very
nice
roasted
malt
flavor
mixed
with
some
sweet
caramel
malts
really
nice
combination
of
flavors
makes
for
a
tastier
than
average
dunkel
had
this
yesterday
with
some
roast
pork
braised
red
cabbage
and
potato
pancakes
and
an
almost
near
perfect
match
in
my
mind
poured
a
richy
tawny
brown
with
a
light
brown
one
finger
head
lighter
aromas
hints
of
brown
sugar
and
smoke
a
little
ironlike
quality
as
wellflavors
are
subtle
upfront
but
really
came
out
with
food
that
smokiness
reappeares
and
really
did
show
itself
with
flavors
of
the
pork
the
lightly
sweet
brown
sugar
quality
and
caramel
sweetness
was
a
nice
contrast
to
the
braised
cabbagea
nice
fluffylike
mouthfeel
kept
the
beer
from
being
filling
what
a
cool
dark
lager
unique
in
its
smokinees
i
think
and
quite
nice
subtle
complexities
to
go
along
with
being
just
crazy
food
friendlya
real
polish
winner
here
pours
a
clear
chestnutty
brown
topped
with
a
pufy
cream
colored
head
unusual
color
as
brown
beers
are
actually
more
like
mahogany
this
ones
much
more
towards
an
aged
leathery
brown
color
good
retention
and
lacing
sticking
around
for
the
long
haul
pretty
dunkellike
aroma
with
a
hint
of
woodsy
campfire
smokiness
light
but
present
and
intriguing
a
bit
of
floral
hops
in
the
mix
the
flavor
opens
with
lagery
clean
malt
sweetly
roasty
in
that
dunkel
way
burnt
caramel
with
an
added
splash
of
woodsmoked
malty
sweetness
which
always
reminds
me
of
smoked
cheddar
or
bacon
clean
all
the
way
through
absolutely
no
off
flavors
lightly
smoky
finish
with
modest
floral
hop
bitters
dryish
with
feisty
carbonation
lightish
bodied
a
nice
sessioner
with
a
bit
of
smoke
for
complexity
but
not
enough
so
that
you
cant
even
look
at
bacon
for
a
week
id
like
to
see
one
of
these
brewed
by
a
us
craft
brewery
rather
than
a
smoked
porter
firebrewed
dark
beer
pours
an
dark
brown
almost
pitch
black
color
with
a
creamy
light
tan
head
smell
consists
of
coffee
and
slight
hints
of
dark
fruit
and
chocolate
taste
is
just
delicious
taste
starts
out
with
sweet
roasted
malt
and
finishes
slightly
bitter
with
a
lingering
coffee
aftertaste
wow
mouthfeel
is
velvety
smooth
overall
this
is
an
outstanding
brew
that
is
definately
recommended
this
is
a
difficult
beer
to
review
its
tasty
with
a
nice
smoked
flavor
but
not
enough
to
be
a
porter
a
beautiful
dark
beer
with
a
12
inch
head
on
it
the
smell
is
sweet
malt
and
smokey
roasted
malt
its
a
great
full
beer
both
in
taste
and
mouthfeel
that
really
makes
me
realize
that
flavor
and
how
a
beer
feels
in
my
mouth
is
really
the
most
important
thing
fr
me
appearance
and
aroma
are
great
but
give
me
taste
anytime
i
think
on
of
these
is
my
limit
overall
a
very
interesting
beer
essentially
a
light
bodied
porter
nothing
really
that
amazing
here
but
enjoyable
nonetheless
16
9
ounce
bottle
i
am
familiar
with
okocims
porter
so
i
eagerly
jumped
at
the
opportunity
to
try
this
one
since
it
is
a
large
bottle
0
5
l
i
poured
it
into
a
large
glass
over
0
5
l
it
poured
a
dark
reddishblack
with
a
large
tight
tan
head
which
dissipated
slightly
leaving
nice
lacing
the
aroma
is
immediately
malty
and
sweet
with
hints
of
dark
fruits
the
taste
is
also
malty
and
slightly
sweet
and
fruity
but
very
complex
with
hints
of
smoke
after
all
the
malts
are
fire
roasted
around
the
edges
it
is
fullbodied
and
smooth
and
drinks
really
easily
its
not
perfect
but
it
certainly
got
my
attention
as
a
beer
that
id
like
to
keep
around
a
good
beer
that
is
very
drinkable
and
enjoyable
try
it
its
a
pretty
drinkable
beer
and
if
i
find
it
ontap
i
will
give
it
another
go
i
wont
ask
my
friend
to
bring
this
one
back
from
poland
again
some
head
residue
a
muddy
brown
with
amber
highlights
when
held
to
the
light
a
rather
pleasent
aroma
nice
nose
on
this
one
some
smokey
chocolat
darker
malts
well
present
light
bodied
but
quite
decent
tasting
for
a
dunkel
lager
a
little
watery
maybe
but
i
think
its
just
part
of
this
style
to
not
be
too
robust
nice
malt
featured
in
the
back
part
of
the
mouth
not
much
aftertaste
or
finish
but
more
taste
as
far
as
in
terms
of
standard
lagers
like
a
refreshing
taste
this
i
found
to
be
perhaps
a
little
artificial
at
times
very
caramelly
malt
but
reminds
me
of
purple
freezies
in
being
more
of
an
artificial
flavour
i
think
perhaps
its
the
amber
malt
leaving
me
with
this
feeling
that
aside
this
is
a
good
one
not
bad
at
all
tasty
an
interesting
brew
clearly
an
effort
to
design
a
rauchbier
for
the
masses
as
already
mentioned
much
better
than
regular
okocim
lager
worth
a
try
update
i
thought
id
update
by
2006
review
with
a
2008
sample
it
is
greater
than
the
sum
of
its
parts
my
ratings
are
all
3
5
with
one
3
0
but
i
will
buy
this
whenever
i
see
it
in
the
store
its
nothing
stellar
but
strangely
sessionable
500
ml
bottle
bought
in
poland
beautiful

colour
large
and
lasting
creamy
tan
head
aroma
of
rye
bread
caramel
and
toasted
malts
hints
of

flavour
is
very
rich
and
malty
sweet
you
might
say
very
sweet
notes
of
caramel
and
plenty
of
lightly
toasted
malts
hints
of
coffee
just
enough
hops
in
the
finish
to
balance
the
sweetness
interesting
beer
d
while
remaining
an
easydrinking
dark
lager
it
lacks
enough
flavour
and
body
to
make
it
really
enjoyable
hence
the
belowaverage
drinkability
reading
the
review
of
others
i
was
surprised
that
no
one
called
out
the
distinct
molasses
aroma
my
glass
has
been
empty
for
quite
a
while
and
i
can
still
detect
it
also
it
seems
that
the
ratings
are
low
because
the
reviewers
expected
this
beer
to
be
something
it
is
not
it
is
actually
a
fine
representation
of
a
dark
malty
lager
this
is
a
very
enjoyable
beverage
give
this
beer
a
try
ignoring
the
pseudointellectual
critics
who
have
complained
pours
a
caramellycola
color
maltysweet
smell
with
a
offputting
musty
car
note
cloying
and
syrupy
wholly
uninteresting
but
still
it
tastes
alright
and
is
unoffensive
which
is
about
all
you
can
hope
for
with
these
euro
lagers
the
peak
of
pilsener
brewery
the
caramel
content
gives
a
distinct
flavor
and
feel
to
this
high
alcohol
beer
o
this
is
a
pretty
forgettable
beer
that
being
said
the
euro
dark
lager
style
does
not
lend
itself
to
greatness
an
okay
euro
dark
lager
not
much
to
write
home
about
but
not
exactly
offensive
either
though
it
could
possibly
be
improved
upon
if
fresher
i
suppose
at
least
ive
had
another
beer
from
an
islamic
nation
which
is
something
of
a
rarity
overall
good
brew
especially
if
you
are
looking
to
try
offerings
from
around
the
globe
put
this
turkish
beer
on
your
list
not
a
bad
turkish
offering
to
be
honest
this
is
just
about
as
good
as
ive
tried
from
the
country
with
only
the
odd
exception
definitely
drinkable
and
easy
going
its
one
worth
picking
up
if
youre
in
the
country
but
probably
not
if
you
mange
to
find
it
elsewhere
overall
this
turkish
whale
definitely
lives
up
the
the
lack
of
hype
a
solid
dark
lager
for
sure
people
will
give
it
a
rough
time
as
this
style
is
not
as
well
appreciated
as
others
but
its
definitely
a
good
example
of
the
style
and
something
i
would
have
appreciated
seeing
more
often
or
at
least
at
all
while
i
was
in
turkey
thanks
for
sending
your
sketchy
buddy
to
do
all
the
dirty
work
on
this
one
doops
well
worth
it
o
looking
past
the
aging
effects
i
see
a
solid
dunkel
worth
revisiting
efes
could
have
been
on
the
verge
of
being
a
surprise
if
it
were
in
prime
condition
clear
glass
is
usually
not
a
beers
friend
more
so
in
the
sunny
climate
of
turkey
stay
away
until
its
the
only
game
in
town
then
find
another
town
appears
very
dark
brown

fairly

smooth
easy

aftertaste
thin

overall
not

it
has
a
good
mild

and
high
drinkability
pours
an
almost
opaque
super
dark
crimsonbrown
with
a
foamy
khaki
head
that
settles
to
a
partial
film
on

of
the
beer
thin
rings
of
lace
line
the
glass
on
the
drink
down
smell
is
of
toasted
malt
caramel
and
a
brewed
tea
aroma
taste
is
mainly
of
toasted
bread
and
slightly
burnt
caramel
there
is
a
very
mild
amount
of
roasty
bitterness
on
the
palate
with
each
sip
this
beer
has
a
lower
level
of
carbonation
with
a
slightly
crisp
mouthfeel
overall
this
is
a
pretty
average
beer
that
is
decently
drinkable
but
nothing
too
exciting
rjt
mouthfull
is
heavy
and
it
fills
your
whole
mouth
giving
you
a
dry
taste
however
i
liked
it
in
this
one
because
it
wasnt
very
sour
smells
and
tastes
partially
skunky
but
there
is
some
mild
toasted
bread
in
there
in
the
background
of
the
flavor
and
some
mild
floral
hopping
in
the
aroma
and
thats
it
a
simple
beer
with
not
much
going
for
it
other
than
the
very
basics
overall
its
not
very
good
but
not
quite
bad
enough
for
me
to
call
it
terrible
it
is
however
completely
forgettable
and
most
certainly
not
good
enough
to
actually
seek
out
some
character
through
the
burned
notes
overall
efes
dark
is
certainly
drinkable
and
better
than
some
other
dark
lagers
i
have
had
but
i
think
i
prefer
their
standard
pilsner
o
this
beer
is
rather
easy
to
drink
and
has
a
nice
amount
of
flavors
o
the
flavor
of
this
beer
almost
reminds
me
of
an
english
mild
but
a
little
sweeter
this
beer
is
enjoyable
and
easy
to
drink
might
be
a
little
too
high
abv
to
be
sessionable
but
definitely
one
i
would
have
again
odrink
it
coldworth
to
try
it
this
really
looked
like
cola
as
it
was
being
decanted
from
the
bottle
into
a
glass
well
except
for
the
twoplus
fingers
of
dense
deeptan
head
that
seemed
determined
to
hang
around
color
was
a
deep
brown
with
garnet
highlights
and
good
clarity
for
the
shade
nose
gave
an
initial
hit
of
molasses
and
i
wondered
how
that
would
translate
in
terms
of
taste
only
one
way
i
know
of
to
find
out
mouthfeel
was
medium
at
best
and
the
taste
was
somewhat
medicinal
like
cough
syrup
when
i
was
a
kid
but
not
necessarily
in
a
bad
way
i
was
still
getting
the
molasses
vibe
and
as
long
as
you
are
okay
with
that
flavor
profile
it
was
a
drinkable
beer
finish
exuded
a
light
tartness
to
go
with
the
light
astringency
not
bad
not
great
but
definitely
interesting
perhaps
if
a
style
descriptor
is
ever
written
i
can
revise
my
scores
as
needed
now
that
this
is
available
in
bc
in
a
can
i
gave
it
a
try
not
a
bad
dark
lager
with
a
nice
caramel
note
to
the
finish
on
par
with
many
of
the
euro
dark
lagers
i
like
the
full
mouthfeel
and
the
slightly
nutty
nose
it
is
also
very
food
friendly
which
makes
it
a
good
bbq
beer
i
will
be
picking
up
some
cans
of
this
for
the
summer
as
it
is
hard
to
find
decent
darker
lagers
in
cans
poured
from
a
brown
11
2
oz
bottle
has
a
very
dark
brown
color
with
a
12
inch
head
smell
is
of
malts
toffee
taste
is
good
malts
smoke
some
caramel
a
touch
of
sweetness
feels
medium
bodied
in
the
mouth
and
overall
is
a
refreshing
and
enjoyable
beer
overall
i
dont
know
why
this
beer
doesnt
get
more
love
im
finding
it
very
satisfying
and
tasty
o
its
a
bit
better
than
your
average
euro
dark
lager
not
overwhelmingly
so
but
only
a
bit
so
worth
a
try
but
maybe
not
worth
the
price
overall
this
is
a
bit
of
a
mixed
bag
im
personally
not
too
into
it
but
i
see
how
some
people
might
be
if
there
was
something
missing
i
would
say
that
with
its
slightly
elevated
alcohol
content
there
is
not
any
extra
alcohol
flavor
which
i
think
would
be
a
plus
no
need
to
hunt
this
one
down
efess
pilsener
is
better
o
pretty
good
for
what
it
is
would
have
never
guessed
the

had
a
can
of
this
beer
that
i
shared
with
others
at
a
beer
tasting
i
borought
this
back
from
turkey
the
can
is
quite
cool
black
with
a
red
panther
the
appearance
was
a
darker
amber
almost
a
caramel
color
decent
carbonation
lent
to
a
nice
head
that
did
not
lace
there
really
was
nothing
on
the
nose
perhaps
some
malt
but
that
was
it
the
taste
did
have
some
malt
and
sweetness
to
it
but
mostly
grain
this
beer
wasnt
too
bad
but
i
probably
just
pefer
to
drink
the
standard
efes
the
beer
pours
a
dark
brown
color
with
a
tan
head
the
aroma
is
heavy
on
the
malt
with
some
toffee
and
a
little
bit
of
grass
from
the
hops
the
flavor
is
equally
malty
i
get
some
cocoa
and
toasted
malt
as
well
as
some
toffee
and
a
little
bit
of
grass
thin
to
medium
mouthfeel
and
medium
carbonation
not
bad
but
nothing
special
not
bad
for
the
area
but
nothing
i
would
ever
get
out
of
the
area
a
surprisingly
quaffable
if
not
particularly
memorable
strongish
dark
lager
reminiscent
at
times
of
a
lowgrade
dunkel
on
the
sweet
side
overall
but
balanced
to
the
point
where
my
palate
essentially
just
doesnt
give
a
flying
fuck
despite
what
my
brain
is
telling
it
i
went
to
restraint
row
in
new
york
city
and
experienced
turkish
food
for
the
first
time
when
i
asked
for
a
turkish
beer
they
offered
fees
and
fees
dark
i
went
with
the
dark
and
i
would
compare
it
to
new
castle
which
i
love
unfortunately
it
was
not
as
creamy
and
it
was
a
hint
skunky
i
would
like
to
give
a
fresh
efes
beer
a
try
but
the
initial
smell
ruined
my
experience
with
this
beer
decent
for
the
style
impressive
for
the
efes
family
overall
enjoyable
but
not
noteworthy
acceptable
on
the
palate
and
drinkable
enough
if
the
flavor
suits
the
drinker
this
would
easily
wash
down
some
fresh
bread
with
figs
and
cheese
or
sustain
a
long
evening
with
some
turkish
coffee
at
the
end
d
got
this
in
the
botm
shipment
guess
i
enjoyed
the
other
2
because
i
had
a
few
too
many
beers
before
but
this
one
isnt
impressive
at
all
after
i
sat
down
to
review
it
the
first
and
worst
beer
i
had
on
the
hot
holiday
trip
2010
overall
a
respectable
entry
out
of
turkey
but
nothing
id
go
out
of
the
way
for
i
really
didnt
like
this
beer
and
probably
was
generous
on
the
ratings
if
this
is
turkeys
best
i
hope
they
have
a
good
beer
import
overall
a
weak
lager
that
just
didnt
have
many
redeeming
qualities
standard
bland
macro
not
available
here
in
tx
though
we
do
get
the
efes
pilsener
which
i
have
at
cafe
istanbul
as
its
best
option
there
got
in
bomc
rotation
liked
the
pilsener
so
wanted
to
try
this
one
its
on
the
menu
there
but
they
never
have
it
and
cant
explain
why
on
the
menu
glad
i
got
to
try
it
finally
but
one
is
enough
nn
comments
a
beer
of
the
month
selection
although
i
have
traveled
in
turkey
i
cannot
remember
trying
this
beer
in
country
i
would
like
to
try
this
beer
at
its
freshest
moment
this
is
a
very
refreshing
tasty
and
drinkable
dark
lager
as
good
as
any
other
european
dark
lager
ive
tried
drinkability
an
easy
drinking
beer
that
has
a
good
taste
to
it
thought
the
clear
glass
bottle
puts
one
off
the
smell
for
now
efes
beers
are
pretty
much
the
only
ones
you
can
get
in
turkey
beer
culture
is
obviously
not
a
big
component
in
this
country
but
this
beer
in
particular
makes
miller
light
seem
drinkable
quite
simply
even
for
its
style
profile
its
boring
bland
undercarbonated
and
doesnt
feel
right
efes
dark
is
a
very
sparkling
solid
dark
reddish
brown
beer
with
a
small
turbulent
khaki
head
it
has
a
skunky
aroma
yeah
its
just
skunk
here
cant
really
pick
up
on
anything
else
it
has
a
medium
light
body
thats
lively
in
the
mouth
with
a
rough
finish
a
poison
chemical
flavor
overpowers
everything
im
pretty
sure
thats
fusel
there
is
a
faint
sweetness
and
bitterness
in
there
but
i
really
have
to
pay
attention
to
detect
it
this
gave
me
a
headache
at
least
it
looked
nice
im
going
to
chalk
this
up
to
a
lightpoisoned
bottle
d
could
be
better
with
some
more
carbonation
i
would
consider
this
great
tho
it
is
ultra
carbonated
the
flavor
is
metallic
and
crappy
if
budweiser
were
dark
like
most
edls
the
color
stands
as
a
highly
translucent
dark
amberbrown
with
a
minor
white
froth
standing
in
for
a
beefier
head
the
smell
here
is
very
musty
with
a
strong
malt
character
coming
through
though
drier
than
usual
theres
a
hint
of
smoke
but
the
darker
more
foreboding
style
of
smoke
rather
than
the
peated
variety
commonly
found
in
rauchs
and
schwarzes
there
is
also
a
slight
inexplicable
sourness
hanging
in
the
background
like
a
traitor
of
old
the
taste
follows
the
nose
with
more
must
and
more
sourness
with
the
malts
thrust
into
the
background
with
some
force
this
is
unfortunately
the
extent
of
the
complexity
here
luckily
it
has
a
very
light
body
and
does
not
coat
the
mouth
allowing
the
strange
sour
must
to
leave
rather
quickly
im
not
impressed
here
this
beer
pours
a
brilliantly
clear
dark
brown
with
a
surprisingly
large
rocky
head
that
fades
rather
quickly
the
bubbles
are
tan
and
smallish
aroma
wise
i
get
a
faint
graininess
and
stinky
cabbage
along
with
a
touch
of
roast
the
beer
is
thin
and
lifeless
with
a
slight
toasted
note
but
it
finishes
very
dry
in
the
back
of
the
palate
not
a
pleasing
dry
but
borderline
astringent
no
hop
aroma
flavor
and
just
the
slightest
hint
of
bittering
not
an
appealing
beer
at
all
i
would
not
recommend
it
i
first
had
this
beer
in
turkey
though
i
would
revisit
it
well
i
think
it
was
better
in
turkey
maybe
it
was
more
fresh
this
pours
dark
but
not
not
thick
at
all
doesnt
have
much
nose
at
all
maybe
a
hint
of
coffee
the
taste
is
somewhat
lacking
but
is
pretty
drinkable
body
was
a
bit
lacking
for
a
dark
beer
not
a
good
effort
just
a
sweet
and
syrupy
beverage
that
misses
the
mark
i
guess
i
can
say
ive
tried
it
but
i
wont
be
going
back
dont
go
out
of
your
way
for
this
one
the
mouthfeel
is
pretty
light
zingy
carbonation
very
refreshing
so
points
for
that
a
nice
efes
option
for
beer
geeks
in
turkey
who
want
something
maltier
d
not
bad
lots
of
pretty
good
flavors
they
dont
seem
to
come
together
to
create
a
good
beer
though
d
not
too
bad
pretty
good
for
the
style
the
aroma
is
sweet
like
maple
syrup
and
brown
sugar
combined
with
some
toasted
gains
throw
in
the
appearance
is
dark
brown
with
a
super
small
head
the
flavor
is
like
the
aroma
with
medicinal
bitter
and
cardboard
elements
the
palate
is
thin
overall
its
bad
after
a
while
the
beer
gets
a
bit
generic
perhaps
even
a
little
sloppy
with
a
musty
head
and
grainy
body
pours
a
solid
brown
with
no
special
features
the
mouthfeel
is
more
comforting
with
a
little
bit
of
spice
and
a
little
bit
of
cocoa
and
a
whole
lot
more
of
porter
feel
than
a
typical
knockoff
dark
all
in
all
though
because
of
its
crispness
it
is
quite
refreshing
and
very
drinkable
d
pretty
much
average
good
no
but
its
not
bad
either
bland
i
would
call
it
it
is
has
mostly
a
lightly
sweet
roasted
toffee
flavour
with
hints
of
herbs
prunes
and
nuts
in
the
finish
its
easy
to
drink
smooth
and
has
fairly
firm
character
tastes
of
a
generic
dark
beer
lots
of
malts
good
mix
with
spices
smokey
flavor
with
a
lot
of
caramel
mixed
in
reminded
me
of
another
beer
that
i
had
couldnt
put
my
finger
on
it
i
would
recommend
it
to
try
i
was
happy
with
one
wouldnt
go
as
far
as
a
six
pack
not
a
bad
beer
to
throw
back
i
do
enjoy
the
efes
lager
better
this
was
a
different
experience
from
a
country
i
generally
dont
associate
with
beer
which
is
why
i
tried
it
i
like
some
of
the
ideas
going
into
it
but
the
variety
of
components
are
a
bit
too
much
and
it
feels
unbalanced
and
a
bit
unpleasant
this
was
pretty
average
all
the
way
around
with
hthe
exception
of
taste
i
was
really
surprised
poured
up
a
clear
dark
brown
and
almost
looked
like
a
furniture
varnish
smell
was
like
most
any
other
lager
with
a
tiny
bit
of
toasted
malt
way
down
inside
you
really
have
to
be
looking
for
it
mouthfeel
is
pretty
average
being
neither
unpleasant
nor
note
worthy
the
taste
though
really
caught
me
off
guard
this
actually
had
a
fair
hop
bitterness
to
it
and
a
lovely
dry
dark
malt
flavour
on
the
finish
nice
indeed
still
not
an
amazing
beer
but
somewhat
better
than
i
was
anticipating
pours
dark
with
some
light
passing
through
nose
is
dirty
seems
almost
rotten
in
a
way
flavor
is
pretty
decent
smooth
sweet
tone
with
a
minor
earthy
edge
that
is
kind
of
like
dirtier
water
feel
is
kind
of
thin
on
liquid
with
a
decent
carbonation
easy
to
drink
but
not
as
smooth
as
youd
want
really
nice
to
try
nice
to
move
on
d
very
disappointing
their
pilsner
is
quite
nice
this
is
a
let
down
its
not
bad
its
ok
to
drink
but
its
pretty
mediocre
overall
will
have
to
tell
the
cashier
lady
to
keep
stocking
this
one
drinkability
not
bad
not
great
i
found
it
surprisingly
drinkable
considering
the
sweetness
lack
of
carbonation
and
the
lack
of
balance
to
me
this
is
sort
of
a
dessert
lager
who
would
have
thought
that
not
me
even
though
i
thought
this
beer
was
kind
of
interesting
i
dont
really
think
id
go
back
to
it
it
was
worth
trying
once
i
purchased
my
bottle
in
council
bluffs
ia
as
part
of
a
mix
sixpack
efes
dark
isnt
one
of
the
more
stellar
members
of
a
style
that
struggles
to
be
relevant
in
my
eyes
its
a
more
faithful
version
of
its
style
than
its
german
pilsener
wannabe
brother
but
thats
about
as
much
praise
as
i
can
muster
upon
decanting
into
the
glass
the
beer
released
an
exremely
peppylepue
aroma
tha
that
detered
me
instantly
just
because
you
brew
a
eurolager
doesnt
give
permission
to
release
a
brew
that
smells
badly
nevertheless
after
time
the
beer
does
outgass
and
reveals
a
much
improved
ordinary
beer
a
mildly
toasty
brew
that
houses
a
very
amber
bockish
flavor
falls
short
of
the
beer
that
i
wanted
it
to
be
moderate
in
every
sense
at
the
textrue
though
nothing
obtrusive
finishes
short
of
clean
or
crisp
just
not
the
ideal
brew
a
simple
attempt
at
a
german
dunkel
that
needs
help
pours
a
medium
brown
color
with
a
thick
tan
head
and
spotty
lacing
nose
is
of
sweet
malts
and
some
fruity
yeasty
characteristics
palate
is
a
smooth
moderately
sweet
malty
dominance
with
only
a
faint
hop
balance
finish
is
surprisingly
dry
body
is
lightmedium
and
has
moderate
carbonation
i
find
this
beer
easy
to
drink
but
a
bit
unmemorable
wouldnt
go
out
of
my
way
for
it
but
wouldnt
turn
it
down
if
offered
either
its
okay
not
a
bad
try
but
needs
improvement
the
brew
has
a
rich
dark
color
a
bit
like
dark
chocolate
and
lots
of
visible
carbonation
a
decent
head
dissipated
quickly
the
aroma
is
malty
and
a
bit
floral
i
cant
say
much
for
the
taste
the
malty
sweetness
hits
immediatly
followed
by
the
bitterness
of
hops
it
could
use
a
lot
more
complexity
balance
and
flavor
besides
simple
sweet
and
bitter
and
it
feels
rather
thin
in
the
mouth
i
wouldnt
necessarily
say
i
like
it
better
than
efes
pilsener
which
i
think
is
an
honest
pils
i
freqently
find
that
baseline
indigenous
beers
like
this
one
find
their
place
mated
with
regional
food
like
indian
lagers
with
spicy
curries
so
i
drank
the
efes
dark
with
a
selection
of
turkish
vegetable
appetizers
and
flat
bread
again
from
the
turkish
store
natch
the
pairing
didnt
yield
the
greatest
results
but
perhaps
one
would
have
better
luck
drinking
it
with
something
more
meatbased
like
a
good
spicy
kebab
to
anyone
who
would
choose
to
go
this
route
i
would
only
say
afiyet
olsun
pours
a
brown
color
but
looks
watery
as
i
can
see
through
it
not
much
head
poor
retention
no
lacing
the
aroma
is
fairly
malty
with
some
caramel
and
hints
of
spicy
hops
the
flavor
is
quite
smooth
and
there
is
quite
a
bit
of
caramel
malt
present
the
finish
is
fairly
bitter
the
body
is
light
and
the
drinkability
is
good
fairly
light
but
theres
really
nothing
special
here
opinion
i
am
pretty
disappointed
in
this
beer
the
aroma
was
a
lot
more
pleasant
than
the
flavor
this
dry
grainy
thing
is
really
distracting
i
dont
think
that
the
bitterness
in
the
finish
is
made
up
as
much
of
hops
as
it
is
from
the
base
malts
and
the
roast
pours
a
dark
mohogany
with
a
thin
head
that
disapears
into
a
few
stray
bubbles
the
aroma
is
clean
a
little
sweet
hint
ofchocolate
the
flavor
is
prune
malty
chocolate
spicy
hint
of
hopsack
little
peppery
in
the
finish
the
mouthfeel
is
a
little
thick
i
did
not
like
that
it
had
the
consisticy
of
a
big
stout
or
barleywine

the

offers
a

its

crossed
the

its
lightly

and

caramelish
cocoaish
and
lightly

flavor
appears
and
widens
as
it
warms
a
firm

apparent
and
its
floral
and
spicy
hop
flavors
appear
in
the
finish
along
with
some
lingering
residual
bittersweet
chocolate
as
you
progress
through
the
glass
its
alcohol
starts
to
show
but
it
never
becomes
more
than
an
attractive
additional
asset
to
the
beer
its
not
real
complex
or
even
that
rich
but
it
is
a
very
nicely
done
dark
beer
with
an
interesting
maltiness
kudos
the
beer
pours
a
translucent
dark
brown
color
with
a
thick
frothy
tan
head
that
slowly
fades
to
lacing
the
aroma
is
decent
it
has
a
sweet
malty
scent
that
boasts
of
pale
crystal
and
roasted
barley
it
has
a
dry
fruity
lager
yeast
aroma
as
well
the
taste
is
decent
as
well
it
has
a
thick
and
rich
malty
flavor
that
goes
down
smooth
and
finishes
sweet
and
dry
this
is
a
pretty
good
brew
but
its
a
little
too
syrupy
the
mouthfeel
is
fine
it
is
a
medium
bodied
beer
with
adequate
carbonation
this
is
a
good
drinking
brew
despite
the
fact
that
it
leaves
a
lot
of
residual
sweetness
in
the
finish
this
was
my
first
brew
from
turkey
very
nice
one
at
that
i
was
expecting
something
skunky
and
wimpy
instead
i
got
a
nice
dark
lager
with
a
dark
malty
backbone
had
a
nice
amount
of
alcohol
in
the
brew
but
was
hardly
detectable
a
bit
chocolatey
up
front
and
clean
afterwards
very
nice
brew
its
dark
and
its
light
what
more
could
you
want
i
cant
think
of
any
received
this
in
my
final
selections
from
the
beer
of
the
month
club
not
too
sure
its
been
off
the
shelf
but
it
did
not
taste
fresh
it
did
pour
a
great
head
and
nice
lacing
with
decent
carbonation
no
accents
of
caramel
or
chocolate
that
is
mentioned
with
the
accompanied

on

side
served
at
a

the

kind

the
butter
seems
dominant
which
is
too
bad
as
i
was
hoping
for
something
with
a
bigger

bit
if
a
cloying
sweetness
like
candied
sugar
or
lollipops
bit
of
a
sticky

its
nothing
to
bitch
about
but
it
certainly
deserves
no
praise
either
despite
its
heaviness
i
could
drink
several
its
memorable
far
better
than
the
pilsener
pours
clear
dark
amber
almost
caramel
color
under
a
thin
offwhite
head
that
fades
quickly
to
collar
and

no
lace
the
nose
has
a
touch
of
caramel
to
it
the
mouth
is
light
and
prickly
the
taste
is
not
unpleasant
but
i
expect
more
from
a
dark
theres
some
caramel
and
malty
sweetness
in
the
opening
and
a
very
slight
hint
of
hops
in
the

no

the

is
sweet
this
is
the
best
beer
ive
had
today

im
not

a

this
is
a
big
fail
i
dont
know
if
the

beer
out
of
a
bottle
this
beer
was
a
copper
color
with
one
finger
of
khaki
colored
head
the
retention
was
soso
and
it
left
spots
of
lacing
the
aroma
was
of
cereal
grains
a
bit
of
toasted
malt
and
a
bit
of
sweet
malt
the
flavors
were
not
as
appealing
however
it
tasted
a
bit
skunky
with
notes
of
cereal
booze
sweet
malt
caramel
malt
and
an
underlying
flavor
of
h
that
seemed
to
spoil
the
rest
the
mouthfeel
was
frothy
the
body
medium
and
the
carbonation
a
touch
too
high
i
wasnt
really
sure
what
to
expect
from
this
one
and
even
after
trying
it
i
wasnt
really
sure
what
to
think
personally
it
just
didnt
appeal
to
my
palate
oi
saw
this
a
cyclone
liquors
the
other
day
so
i
decided
to
pick
it
up
for
2
49
and
was
pleasantly
suprised
for
the
price
considering
it
is
from
the
ukraine
very
good
value
and
really
tasty
o
as
far
as
european
dark
lagers
go
this
one
is
very
enjoyable
if
it
displayed
a
more
pronounced
hop
flavor
and
a
little
less
carbonation
it
would
be
a
stellar
example
of
the
style
overall
this
is
a
very
solid
dark
lager
though
there
is
room
for
improvement
appearance
has
a
red
ruby
brown
color
leaving
a
quickly
dissapating
head
smell
of
mellow
malts
and
hops
taste
of
lightly
roasted
malts
with
a
balanced
mellow
hop
that
finishes
clean
and
slightly
dry
mouthfeel
is
light
with
good
carbonation
nothing
complex
just
an
easy
drinker
overall
a
beautiful
beer
in
color
disappointing
head
great
aroma
and
good
flavor
goes
down
smooth
but
leaves
you
with
too
much
syrup
flavor
i
would
prefer
to
try
this
in
the
fallwinter
seasons
i
may
get
this
again
cracked
open
a
bottle
for
a
sunday
night
cap
there
were
hint
of
oxidation
and
prolonged
aging
but
this
was
still
a
fine
beer
sure
ill
say
it
had
a
velvety
feel
as
the
label
suggests
its
a
moderately
thick
somewhat
sweet
not
too
sweet
lager
thats
heavy
with
dried
fruit
flavors
notes
of
roast
and
caramel
and
a
hint
of
leather
and
cider
from
age
i
presume
theres
a
mild
balancing
bitterness
this
really
is
not
a
bad
beer
at
all
in
the
end
id
call
it
a
tasty
dessert
beer
thats
not
cloying
or
filling
2
19
or
whatever
hell
theres
some
flavor
there
for
sure
ill
go
in
again
poured
a
2
head
which
pretty
quickly
dissipated
to
18
dark
in
color
but
with
a
reddish
tint
when
held
to
the
light
no
wonder
they
call
it
velvet
smell
and
taste
of
barley
malt
and
rye
a
very
mild
beer
easy
to
drink
in
fact
the
mildness
is
a
surprise
considering
the
darkness
theres
also
a
zingy
acidity
which
is
refreshing
very
drinkable
not
a
whole
lot
above
a
good
pilsner
but
still
a
fine
beer
id
enjoy
any
time
a
decent
dark
lager
nothing
eliciting
strong
oohs
or
aahs
but
still
rather
balanced
and
drinkable
not
bad
as
a
decendant
of
uke
immigrants
im
somewhat
relieved
it
doesnt
suck
this
would
be
great
with
grilled
kielbasa
if
you
want
to
pay
homage
to
ukraine
as
mentioned
i
can
drink
this
by
itself
i
could
see
it
going
well
with
a
big
slice
of
black
forest
cake
the
hint
of
cherry
and
chocolate
would
pair
beautifully
with
this
neat
euro
lager
find
poured
from
a
green
16
9
oz
bottle
has
a
dark
amber
color
with
a
1
inch
head
smell
is
very
mild
some
malts
taste
is
of
malts
some
caramel
sweetness
a
bit
of
hops
good
flavor
feels
full
bodied
in
the
mouth
and
has
good
drinkability
overall
this
is
a
good
quality
beer
i
poured
this
into
a
sam
smith
nonic
the
appearance
looked
very
good
a
mahogany
red
body
an
offwhite
head
with
good
retention
some
lacing
on
the
bottle
smell
is
of
plums
and
dark
fruit
and
the
taste
was
just
that
with
a
little
bit
of
malts
added
in
mouthfeel
was
medium
and
smoooth
and
i
found
myself
gulping
this
down
d
having
one
of
these
every
once
and
a
while
would
be
nice
but
not
to
many
im
about
to
read
other
reviews
on
this
one
because
the
flavor
i
cant
place
is
bugging
me
a
fair
bit
im
not
going
to
give
you
a
reason
not
to
try
this
beer
but
im
not
going
to
give
you
a
reason
to
look
for
it
either
a
mediocre
unoffensive
dark
lager
with
a
bit
of
off
flavour
the
more
it
warms
although
quite
forgettable
ill
pass
on
this
next
time
d
there
are
some
nice
flavors
here
though
it
would
be
better
if
it
loses
the
macro
lager
skunk
and
mouthfeel
d
not
a
bad
beer
still
has
a
little
ways
to
go
with
the
cheap
lager
stank
and
dank
d
i
was
fairly
thirsty
when
i
opened
the
bottle
but
even
after
only
a
few
sipswas
already
looking
forward
to
a
different
beer
sure
one
can
drink
a
bunch
of
these
but
why
im
not
sure
ill
finish
the
rest
of
this
bottle
and
i
would
question
if
it
was
brewed
with
reactor
water
from
chernobyl
but
then
that
was
a
graphite
cooled
plant
i
will
be
looking
for
a
more
appealing
offering
from
the
ukraine
i
was
most
impressed
by
this
beers
smell
it
hinted
cherry
and
smoked
aromas
it
was
actually
very
pleasant
but
that
smell
didnt
translate
into
flavor
which
was
quite
frankly
very
bland
i
was
not
impressed
with
so
much
stuff
to
try
out
there
i
would
not
do
a
take
2
on
this
one
i
never
expected
this
beer
to
be
so
good
d
really
a
pretty
good
tasting
beer
could
be
a
little
bit
overcarbonated
leading
to
a
somewhat
harsh
moutfeel
but
overall
pretty
darn
tasty
in
my
opinion

d
pretty
drinkable
for
the
first
500
ml
but
with
the
strong
caramel
and
toffeecoffee
notes
food
pairing
is
narrow
working
best
with
smokey
foods
like
barbecue
or
chocolate
cake
medium
effervescence
was
a
bit
more
than
expected
medium
body
good
beer
but
not
great
it
aint
no
aventinus
a
decent
malty
dark
lager
with
a
mid
to
dark
colour
and
a
good
head
the
nose
is
subtle
but
grows
as
the
beer
warms
the
beer
is
smooth
drinking
with
a
nice
malty
finish
not
the
hugest
body
of
a
dark
lager
but
food
friendly
and
well
balanced
i
prefer
the
pils
but
would
buy
this
again
the
more
i
think
about
the
more
i
would
relate
this
too
a
lot
of
dunkels
i
have
had
ok
but
not
worth
seeking
out
looks
a
lot
like
pepsi
when
poured
into
my
new
spaten
hefe
glass
tan
head
rushes
to
the
top
of
the
glass
before
it
quickly
runs
out
of
steam
and
settles
to
a
solid
1
inch
head
that
is
flush
with
the
top
of
the
glass
it
then
settles
further
to
a
14
inch
atop
the
dark
brown
beer
i
really
dont
see
any
carbonation
to
speak
of
from
the
bottom
of
the
glass
the
smell
is
of
toasted
malt
cookie
dough
candi
sugar
and
mild
yeast
the
flavor
is
nothing
special
but
in
no
way
offensive
it
has
a
gentle
wave
in
the
flavor
profile
of
toasted
grain
sweetness
upfront
then
a
slow
and
gradual
bittering
towards
the
end
of
the
sip
overall
this
is
a
decent
session
beer
if
you
are
in
the
mood
for
something
similar
to
a
german
schwarzbier
mouthfeel
is
lightmedium
bodied
overall
its
not
to
bad
nothing
spectacular
but
i
wouldnt
avoid
it
either
its
crisp
with
a
good
kick
i
am
a
fan
acquired
at
a
jons
supermarket
in
hollywood
california
the
obolon
oksamytove
is
presented
in
an
eye
appealing
green
bottle
with
gold
and
red
labeling
a
best
before
box
on
the
back
label
remains
undated
but
the
bottle
and
labels
are
in
mint
condition
pouring
a
deep
mahogany
brown
and
featuring
a
rich
n
tan
head
accompanied
by
a
dank
and
slightly
sour
smell
upon
tasting
the
lighttomoderately
carbonated
smooth
mouthfeel
is
appreciated
alongside
subtle
notes
of
chocolate
however
as
i
progress
through
the
glass
a
tangy
bitterness
builds
and
there
is
nothing
too
terribly
exciting
about
this
beer
that
would
motivate
me
to
actively
seek
it
or
recommend
it
to
friends
drinkability
well
ill
never
drink
this
stuff
again
so
draw
your
own
conclusions
from
that
call
me
naive
but
i
actually
thought
oksamytove
had
a
chance
to
be
the
best
obolon
beer
of
them
all
maybe
it
was
the
impressive
label
maybe
it
was
the
intriguing
deep
velvet
who
knows
i
suspected
that
i
was
mistaken
on
the
pour
because
i
smelled
what
was
entering
my
pint
glass
these
guys
need
to
go
back
to
the
drawing
board
better
yet
they
need
to
close
down
and
save
the
taste
buds
of
a
few
million
ukrainians
md
unlike
the
fiercely
fizzy
outlook
the
mouthfeel
is
really
very
smooth
standing
up
to
the
beers
name
alls
well
very
enjoyable
but
the
flavour
profile
is

about

not

either

the

nothing

a

when
you
want
to
keep
it
simple
o
a
mediocre
czech
tmavé
which
by
global
standards
means
a
fine
beer
drinkability
is
ok
kind
of
a
rough
beer
and
quite
heavy
too
although
you
shouldnt
let
the
cheap
looking
bottle
and
the
sugar
listed
in
the
nutricion
facts
frighten
you
off
in
the
end
its
better
than
one
expects
firstly
my
bottle
looks
abit
different
to
this
but
its
exactly
the
same
beer
and
it
pours
a
ruby
cola
hue
with
nice
carbonation
that
leaves
behind
a
creamy
two
finger
head
and
a
layer
of

around

like
the
aroma
of
this

almost
like
maple

lots

it
definately
took
me
by
suprise
as
i
wasnt
expecting
it
to
be
like
this
and
my
only
real
complaint
is
its
mouthfeel
and
if
you
dont
like
sweet
beers
you
will
not
like
this
one
but
im
quite
enjoying
it
and
more
than
likely
will
revisit
the
primator
beers
are
just
hopped
in
the
wrong
way
for
me
overall
a
nice
dark
lager
mouthfeel
is
lighter
than
i
expected
for
such
a
dark
and
flavourful
beer
and
is
surprisingly
refreshing
very
drinkable
all
things
considered
pours
an
extra
dark
chestnut
brown
with
a
couple
fingers
of
thick
tan
head
displaying
some
good
retention
and
fair
lacing
the
aroma
is
is
nutty
umami
mildly
roasty
and
figgy
the
flavor
is
lightly
vinous
nutty
and
meaty
with
a
nicely
bitter
oatmeal
raisin
cookie
finish
mediumthick
bodied
with
a
pleasantly
subdued
carbonation
nicely
done
though
perhaps
a
bit
light
for
the
richly
full
flavor
overall
this
is
a
really
nice
beer
a
fully
flavored
lager
with
nutty
rich
characters
but
also
low
in
alcohol
and
easy
drinking
very
good
d
i
havnt
had
so
many
dark
lagers
but
if
theyre
all
like
this
im
sure
gonna
drink
a
lot
of
them
the
taste
is
full
rich
and
complex
yet
still
light
and
easy
going
with
great
depth
it
has
toasted
grain
hint
of
rich
whole
wheat
earth
caramelised
grain
hint
of
mapple
syrup
root
beer
fullflavour
it
has
both
sweetness
and
a
little
bitterness
plus
a
zesty
spicey
bite
but
the
sweetness
is
a
little
too
strong
and
the
bitterness
is
very
light
the
spicey
zestiness
being
the
main
counterpoint
to
the
sweetness
dunkels
and
dark
lagers
generally
shouldnt
be
very
bitter
anyway
but
it
is
still
just
a
tad
on
the
overly
sweet
side
overall
its
wellrounded
fairly
balanced
with
solid
depth
and
range
of
character
very
pleasant
enjoyable
satisfying
yet
easy
to
drink
a
dark
eurolager
or
a
swartzbier
i
think
it
is
more
in
the
latter
style
anyway
this
beer
is
very
pleasant
tasty
and
highly
drinkable
it
suits
both
a
mediterranean
meze
and
bbq
nice
dark
brown
with
a
tan
head
this
beer
smells
malty
and
tastes
malty
with
a
pleasant
sweetness
to
the
finish
full
bodied
with
long
finish
this
is
a
nice
version
of
the
style
food

with

this
would
be
a
good
addition
to
any

a
good

the
style
dark
lager
worth
a
try
but
there
are
czech
dark
lagers
much
better
than
this
one

drinkability
the
mouthfeel
is

smooth
while
the

and

are

this

a
very
nice
creamy
dark
beer
a
little
disappointed
with
a
name
like
dark
creamy
well
you
get
what
im
saying
dark
yes
creamy
not
even
close
parts
of
this
are
ok
but
its
not
very
balanced
wth
to
much
carbonation
bitterness
and
way
to
thin
i
bought
in
a
sample
pack
would
not
buy
in
a
sixer
overall
a
semi
decent
brew
from
leinenkugels
but
lacking
in
certain
qualities
to
qualify
for
a
creamy
brew
overall
wouldnt
be
my
first
choice
but
still
its
a
solid
enough
beer
for
drinking
now
and
then
wouldnt
go
out
of
my
way
to
get
this
one
leinenkugels
creamy
dark
35
overall
a
solid
beer
that
i
would
recommend
for
others
to
try
overall
ok
brew
the
taste
grew
on
me
a
bit
as
it
warmed
up
for
a
decent
priced
dark
lager
this
does
the
trick
a
very
nice
looking
beer
with
a
somewhat
disagreeable
taste
for
me
originally
in
2008
gave
it
a
solid
eh
would
keep
that
grade
you
know
this
doesnt
suck
and
for
an
american
dark
lager
style
is
actually
isnt
that
bad
good
winter
lager
quality
it
would
be
nice
if
this
beer
was
as
creamy
as
the
name
suggests
but
it
simply
isnt
its
got
some
crispness
to
it
and
its
not
devoid
of
smoothness
its
semidry
and
pretty
light
in
body
o
this
is
the
most
metallic
tasting
beer
ive
had
without
it
this
would
be
a
pretty
good
beer
i
like
a
dark
creamy
beer
and
this
doesnt
really
disappoint
i
would
like
a
little
more
alcohol
content
to
make
this
standout
however
i
decided
to
halfn
half
this
with
canoe
paddler
and
was
pleasantly
surprised
i
poured
the
canoe
paddler
in
an
english
pub
imperial
pint
glass
and
used
a
pouring
spoon
to
drizzle
on
the
creamy
dark
i
am
not
a
huge
fan
of
the
canoe
paddler
by
itself
but
do
like
it
at
times
during
a
session
but
this
half
and
half
i
would
take
to
about
a
4
happy
with
it
i
lived
in
blighty
for
four
years
and
drank
many
a
arf
n
arf
from
many
pubs
they
were
better
but
this
is
nice
for
the
states
wonder
if
anyone
at
leinie
though
of
this
o
worth
buying
again
in
the
fall
a
decent
beer
o
leinenkugel
seems
to
be
improving
with
actual
indications
of
flavor
compared
to
earlier
renditions
ive
experienced
by
them
this
one
is
creamy
sweet
and
dark
and
decent
by
all
accords
o
its
a
beer
worth
knowing
its
a
dark
lager
for
the
masses
it
serves
a
purpose
id
like
to
see
someone
try
this
who
doesnt
drink
beer
outside
of
light
american
lagers
as
far
as
my
money
goes
i
would
only
purchase
this
if
i
was
in
a
dining
situation
where
nothing
else
struck
my
interest
i
wont
bring
him
home
again
i
thing
that
i
dont
like
about
this
beer
is
the
aftertaste
its
very
dull
and
underwhelming
overall
this
is
a
solid
beer
i
do
not
know
if
i
would
buy
a
sixpack
yet
id
try
it
on
draught
at
the
first
notice
drinkability
meh
it
does
not
get
me
excited
but
i
suppose
it
is
a
decent
beer
it
is
not
over
the
top
but
does
provide
nice
flavor
o
the
flavors
in
this
beer
are
pretty
nice
i
didnt
expect
that
much
of
a
hop
presence
in
this
beer
but
i
was
pleasantly
surprised
o
this
beer
is
easy
to
drink
but
does
not
have
any
interesting
flavors
and
seems
a
little
too
watery
on
the
palate
overall
a
decent
beer
drinkable
but
nothing
exceptional
the
estery
character
and
cola
flavor
are
a
bit
offputting
to
the
point
typical
easy
drinking
leinenkugel
not
big
in
flavor
but
if
you
want
to
drink
a
few
and
sit
around
the
campfire
during
the
winter
this
should
do
the
trick
that
is
the
only
reason
i
pick
it
up
o
overall
this
was
exceptional
for
the
company
the
flavors
meld
nicely
compares
to
some
good
stouts
in
my
opinion
the
smell
of
this
beer
is
rich
and
sweet
and
as
creamy
as
you
would
hope
from
a
bottle
with
creamy
in
its
title
it
is
smooth
and
easy
to
drink
but
the
finish
of
the
taste
does
not
maintain
the
high
standard
set
by
the
aroma
the
hops
are
not
over
powering
but
still
leave
more
after
taste
than
my
personal
preference
12oz
bottle
poured
into
a
mug
pours
a
slightly
transparent
dark
blackbrown
with
a
thin
beige
head
no
lace
the
aroma
is
sweet
with
freshbaked
cookies
bread
toffee
sweet
malts
a
moderately
crisp
body
deepens
the
the
feel
of
this
lager
but
theres
a
slickness
to
it
on
the
finish
that
weakens
it
for
me
the
sweetness
carries
over
as
this
beer
is
like
fresh
warm
bread
with
sugar
on
top
light
chocolate
malt
notes
round
out
and
theres
just
a
kiss
of
alcohol
on
the
finish
this
is
an
easy
drinker
though
a
bit
middleoftheroad
that
i
would
like
to
have
on
hand
time
and
again
drinkability
refreshing
but
otherwise
unremarkable
had
this
one
after
softball
poured
into
my
dixie
cup
pours
a
brown
color
with
a
creamy
kahki
one
finger
head
not
bad
here
aroma
is
sweet
roasted
grains
lactose
nuts
flavor
follows
with
a
slightly
nutty
and
sweet
flavor
rather
smooth
a
bit
of
hops
on
the
finish
with
a
slight
sweetness
lingering
on
the
palate
very
smooth
and
easy
drinking
not
bad
honestly
and
i
could
drink
a
lot
of
this
at
a
bbq
for
what
this
is
its
fairly
solid
certainly
not
something
id
go
for
all
the
time
but
when
the
only
options
are
bmc
this
is
a
cut
above
creamy
dark
pours
an
almost
black
dark
color
with
a
tan
head
that
disapated
quickly
there
was
a
bit
of
smokey
aroma
to
it
but
overall
was
weak
the
taste
was
a
little
creamy
a
bit
smokey
and
had
a
decent
sweet
malty
backbone
to
it
but
was
a
bit
watery
overall
a
decent
dark
beer
its
enjoyable
but
could
have
been
better
poured
from
a
brown
12
oz
bottle
has
a
very
dark
brown
color
with
a
1
inch
head
smell
is
mild
some
malts
and
smoke
taste
is
smoke
up
front
some
malts
a
hint
of
charcoal
different
and
unexpected
flavor
profile
feels
medium
bodied
in
the
mouth
and
overall
is
a
decent
brew
overall
i
kind
of
purchased
this
as
a
novelty
idea
for
1
dollar
but
it
ended
up
being
as
good
as
said
price
not
something
to
seek
out
but
never
really
worth
turning
away
overall
this
euro
dark
lager
has
more
positive
points
than
negative
it
would
just
be
nice
if
they
were
more
pronounced
and
given
a
body
that
had
more
heft
oi
like
it
easy
drinking
good
flavor
just
the
right
abv
a
good
dark
lager
tastemouthfeel
smooth
from
the
get
go
yes
creamy
not
so
much
crispness
of
the
hops
gives
way
to
a
dull
malty
finish
thats
not
watery
so
much
as
unremarkable
overall
still
on
the
hunt
for
a
darkblack
lager
that
i
would
buy
again
this
seems
like
a
poor
mans
bock
overall
this
is
a
positively
average
beer
nothing
bad
but
few
things
that
really
make
it
stand
out
if
you
like
lighter
beers
check
it
out
otherwise
probably
pass
pours
a
warm
dark
semitransparent
brown
with
a
nice
thick
light
tan
head
that
hangs
around
for
a
bit
and
leaves
just
a
little
lacing
aroma
has
licorice
unsweet
chocolate
and
miso
notes
plus
a
hint
of
molasses
flavor
seems
a
bit
on
the
thin
side
smoky
with
woody
unsweet
chocolate
and
licorice
notes
not
great
but
still
pleasing
maybe
this
was
from
not
the
best
batch
or
its
better
ontap
texture
has
average
body
and
aboveaverage
fizz
overall
decent
if
not
great
and
worth
a
try
while
this
beer
will
probably
not
win
many
awards
when
stacked
up
against
other
crafts
it
has
a
nice
flavor
and
drinkability
that
make
it
a
very
good
value
i
grew
up
with
leinenkugel
beers
and
i
owe
a
lot
of
my
current
appreciation
of
craft
beer
to
that
company
creamy
dark
doesnt
try
to
do
too
much
and
what
it
does
do
can
really
hit
the
spot
try
pairing
this
with
sauerkrautcovered
bratwurst
from
the
grill
overall
this
is
a
nice
beer
for
the
season
not
exactly
creamy
and
warming
like
one
would
think
this
is
a
great
dark
lager
for
those
who
do
not
care
for
fullflavor
dark
lagers
i
was
expecting
a
bit
more
i
know
leinenkugels
generally
doesnt
get
the
best
ratings
on
here
but
i
do
like
the
taste
of
some
of
their
beers
this
one
was
just
all
right
though
appears
a
clear
dark
brown
color
with
a
relatively
larger
and
lacier
head
than
all
the
other
beers
ive
had
yet
in
my
leinenkugel
session
still
i
would
only
call
the
lacing
and
head
average
quality
at
best
for
something
with
the
word
creamy
on
the
label
the
texture
is
actually
not
all
that
creamy
either
just
a
standard
medium
thickness
still
this
medium
level
of
body
is
slightly
thicker
in
feel
than
all
the
other
beers
from
this
session
thus
far
just
not
really
creamy
to
my
mouth
taste
and
smell
follow
each
other
exactly
once
again
some
chocolate
malt
with
a
modicum
of
roastiness
and
mild
bittering
finishing
things
off
it
does
succeed
at
having
a
classic
clean
lager
character
to
both
the
nose
and
the
flavor
but
thats
about
all
that
strikes
me
as
memorable
about
this
one
not
bad
not
really
great
either
pours
a
deep
amber
to
black
in
color
with
a
light
tan
head
in
the
aroma
a
small
roast
and
creaminess
in
the
taste
a
small
roast
lager
like
and
a
small
lactose
presence
a
smooth
and
medium
bodied
mouthfeel
with
a
small
dry
creamy
roast
in
the
aftertaste
standard
dark
lager
but
a
bit
creamier
and
sweeter
another
unconventional
lager
from
leinenkugels
pours
dark
and
frothy
just
short
of
a
guinness
in
appearance
smells
like
a
standard
dark
lager
roasty
and
malty
im
guessing
here
the
creamy
refers
to
its
texture
not
the
presence
of
lactose
sugars
ala
a
milk
stout
because
there
is
no
residual
sweetness
in
the
smell
or
taste
the
texture
is
not
in
fact
as
creamy
as
i
was
hoping
and
i
found
it
to
be
a
bit
thinner
than
i
was
after
but
still
fuller
bodied
and
smooth
slightly
better
than
average
o
this
is
a
pretty
good
beer
it
doesnt
wow
or
excel
but
its
very
drinkable
and
a
great
cold
weather
beer
overall
yikes
this
is
not
an
f
but
this
is
not
very
good
either
but
at
least
its
better
than
the
one
made
by
guinness
i
snagged
this
brew
for
the
cold
season
that
has
started
meant
to
warm
me
up
in
the
snow
but
doesnt
do
much
of
that
not
as
heavy
as
id
like
i
see
it
as
generic
dark
brew
otherwise
unable
to
be
categorized
wisconsin
you
can
do
better
than
this
its
not
disgusting
overall
its
a
pretty
crappy
beer
i
dont
have
much
else
to
say
besides
that
mouthfeel
this
beer
does
have
a
creaminess
that
is
very
enjoyable
and
makes
for
a
very
drinkable
smooth
beer
overall
this
beer
is
weird
for
me
it
doesnt
taste
like
much
but
i
still
really
like
it
this
is
also
a
beer
that
i
can
consume
rapidly
its
gulpable
not
necessarily
a
good
thing
but
if
youre
not
careful
6
of
these
can
disappear
in
a
hurry
poured
into
a
standard
pint
glass
pours
a
deep
deep
roasted
ruby
red
with
a
black
overtone
airy
fluffy
head
dissipates
to
a
tiny
layer
of
bubbles
surprisingly
there
is
lacing
smells
of
burnt
malts
and
tangy
hops
theres
a
sourness
in
the
aroma
im
not
impressed
with
the
taste
at
all
theres
bitter
chocolates
in
there
if
you
really
look
for
it
otherwise
its
more
like
bitter
hops
over
roasted
malts
even
for
the
euro
dark
lager
style
i
just
feel
like
this
beer
is
a
mess
the
mouthfeel
is
like
that
of
a
lager
overall
i
will
never
drink
this
beer
again
its
not
creamy
and
its
the
wrong
kind
of
dark
not
as
heavy
as
one
would
think
this
is
a
pretty
smooth
offering
from
leinies
it
pours
a
subtle
head
that
dissipates
rather
quickly
smells
roasty
with
a
little
chocolatecoffee
this
is
an
easy
beer
to
drink
that
has
a
nice
smooth
finish
not
to
heavy
for
a
dark
beer
overall
this
was
a
pleasant
surprise
ill
drink
it
again
in
the
winter
months
especially
if
leinies
remains
less
expensive
than
some
of
the
other
darks
i
like
drinkability
is
okay
for
a
dark
lager
it
doesnt
have
the
most
amount
of
taste
for
a
dark
lager
but
it
does
have
enough
balance
to
drink
a
good
amount
of
drink
this
if
youre
at
a
party
and
offered
one
but
dont
go
out
of
your
way
to
get
one
pours
a
dark
cola
brown
color
with
thin
cap
of
greyish
tinted
head
gone
quickly
leaving
a
spot
or
two
floating
on
the
top
scent
is
pail
and
has
notes
of
heavily
toasted
malt
with
faint
notes
of
sweet
cream
and
a
splash
of
unwelcoming
onion
taste
carries
some
enhanced
notes
of
dark
caramel
malts
sweetness
higher
than
expected
ends
with
an
odd
lightly
grassy
and
oniony
note
medium
bodied
lightly
creamy
and
moderately
high
in
carbonation
off
notes
in
scent
and
taste
interfere
with
a
mildly
decent
beer
cheers
m
for
being
a
creamy
i
would
say
this
was
awfully
watery
okay
coating
odd
finish
my
pour
resulted
in
just
under
a
finger
of
lighttan
head
that
wilted
quickly
in
this
unrelenting
heat
color
was
a
deep
darkbrown
with
cola
highlights
at
the
edges
nose
smelled
of
licorice
and
molasses
in
a
lager
mouthfeel
was
kind
of
thin
and
it
tasted
like
drinking
watery
cocoa
powder
mix
wtf
man
this
was
one
bizarre
beer
even
for
me
finish
was
lightly
chocolaty
with
a
mild
smokiness
on
the
extreme
finish
i
really
have
no
point
of
reference
on
this
one
i
am
not
a
fan
of
the
black
ipa
hybrid
style
but
this
was
something
different
i
guess
that
what
bugged
me
was
its
thin
mouthfeel
and
its
lack
of
ooomph
in
terms
of
flavor
its
a
neat
concept
but
it
could
be
better
executed
imho
d
doesnt
do
a
lot
for
me
not
a
lot
of
depth
or
character
the
mouthfeel
is
equally
as
weak
with
a
good
carbonation
but
overlly
dry
for
a
sub
5
brew
just
like
everything
else
the
feel
has
little
to
no
character
and
not
much
enticing
me
to
drink
more
i
can
finish
this
bottle
and
then
never
expect
to
have
another
really
a
simple
not
so
great
brew
this
brew
pours
out
as
a
really
dark
brown
almost
black
in
color
with
a
nice
looking
tan
head
the
aroma
is
packed
with
roasted
and
burnt
malts
and
some
nice
hints
of
hops
on
the
nose
the
taste
is
nicely
roasted
with
a
good
amount
of
malts
upfront
with
a
rich
burnt
bitterness
in
the
aftertaste
the
hops
dont
really
shine
thorugh
in
the
flavor
at
all
the
mouthfeel
is
lighter
than
most
dark
lagers
which
is
ok
i
suppose
id
prefer
it
to
be
a
little
thicker
overall
i
was
happy
to
have
tried
this
one
because
it
was
one
of
the
harder
leinies
to
find
in
my
area
id
drink
this
one
again
o
this
is
certainly
the
best
leinenkugels
offering
i
have
tried
it
looks
amazing
in
the
glass
the
smell
is
nothing
but
inviting
the
taste
is
very
good
and
the
smooth
consistency
is
quite
pleasant
i
highly
recommend
it
overall
not
terrible
by
any
means
and
it
is
what
it
is
from
notes
brownishblack
pour
with
a
minimal
tan
head
aroma
is
of
caramel
roasted
malts
a
bit
of
chocolate
and
heavy
cream
taste
is
creamy
malty
a
bit
of
chocolate
and
lighter
of
the
style
palate
is
sweet
short
and
somewhat
watery
overall
its
not
the
best
dark
lager
ive
ever
had
but
its
about
what
i
expected
from
leinenkugels
decent
drinkability
this
is
an
easy
beer
to
drink
i
believe
i
could
only
drink
23
at
most
the
coffee
taste
is
good
and
it
has
a
nice
balance
that
isnt
too
complex
or
too
boring
d
very
easy
to
drink
good
flavors
and
low
abv
so
you
could
drink
a
few
again
a
pretty
good
little
brew
from
leinenkugels
worth
a
try
actually
kind
of
surprised
to
find
this
in
my
parents
fridge
where
they
have
with
no
small
amount
of
influence
on
my
part
evolved
towards
two
hearted
bells
java
stout
and
other
very
respectable
brews
but
i
can
see
where
it
might
be
the
right
one
for
the
job
under
certain
circumstances
not
bad
not
great
d
out
of
all
the
leines
this
is
one
of
the
few
i
dont
mind
not
a
must
have
but
not
awful
either
taste
it
takes
a
little
while
to
first
get
a
flavorful
taste
but
then
it
goes
from
a
mild
bitterness
to
a
very
pleasant
nutty
aftertaste
i
really
like
the
aftertaste
of
this
one
and
would
really
enjoy
having
a
few
of
these
i
am
not
a
big
fan
of
this
style
but
it
is
just
an
ok
version
of
the
style
it
is
easy
to
drink
but
nothing
i
would
seek
out
again
not
bad
for
the
price
in
the
end
this
could
be
a
gateway
beer
for
mgd
drinkers
ending
in
a
discovery

it
certainly
has
a
handsome
looking
dark
amberruby
red
pour
with
a
little
bit
of
head
that
never
quite
goes
away
the
aroma
is
rather
thin
with
elements
of
yeast
grains
and
malts
the
body
weight
is
around
medium
the
flavor
has
a
hint
of
bitterness
but
it
leaves
a
sour
aftertaste
i
had
it
with
pizza
and
it
was
fine
m
smooth
and
as
advertised
a
bit
creamy
drinkability
this
beer
isnt
bad
decent
little
change
the
brew
looked
and
smelled
good
enough
might
be
more
of
an
entry
level
dark
beer
for
people
looking
to
expand
their
horizons
i
could
drink
a
few
of
these
for
sure
from
the
bottle

i
would
say
that
yes
it
is
smooth
and
easy
to
drink
enjoyable
tasty
brew
worth
another
purchase
this
dark
beer
from
leinies
while
pouring
very
nicely
into
my
beer
mug
where
i
see
a
dark
brownish
beer
with
a
small
yellowishwhite
head
that
has
good
retention
with
not
much
lacing
the
carbonation
is
very
good
and
when
smelling
the
beer
i
can
faintly
smell
some
hops
but
nothing
that
stands
out
i
will
admit
that
this
beer
looks
and
feels
a
lot
better
than
it
tastes
because
while
it
has
a
nice
creamy
texture
to
the
mouthfeel
and
goes
down
nice
and
smoothly
the
taste
is
not
as
good
as
i
was
expecting
when
drinking
it
i
can
taste
some
malts
with
a
slight
taste
of
hops
and
even
though
the
bottle
says
nothing
about
chocolate
being
in
there
i
am
pretty
sure
i
can
taste
a
slight
bitterness
of
chocolate
in
the
aftertaste
i
have
learned
from
this
beer
that
it
might
not
always
taste
as
good
as
it
looks
i
dont
think
this
is
a
bad
beer
but
not
something
to
go
out
of
your
way
for
either
d
malty
easy
drinking
not
complex
or
that
tasty
overall
but
not
so
bad
this
beer
tastes
very
good
it
is
a
bit
darker
and
heavier
than
others
but
nowhere
near
say
a
guinness
draught
d
i
could
drink
this
over
basically
any
other
non
stout
or
porter
drinkability
is
good
i
would
grab
this
beer
if
it
was
one
of
10
beers
available
i
didnt
get
a
whole
lot
out
of
this
beer
glad
i
got
it
in
a
mixed
6
another
step
into
wisconsin
beer
during
the
mans
weekend
it
pours
a
dark
brown
with
garnet
highlights
topped
by
a
finger
of
offwhite
microfoam
the
nose
is
nearly
nonexistent
a
fact
which
was
corroborated
by
others
at
the
table
though
some
intense
nasal
digging
did
eventually
flush
out
some
very
light
notes
of
roasted
malts
coffee
and
caramel
the
taste
is
also
kinda
light
but
not
nearly
as
much
so
as
the
smell
notes
of
coffee
cream
vanilla
and
roasted
malts
dance
around
playfully
on
the
buds
the
body
is
a
sleek
medium
with
a
light
carbonation
and
a
decidedly
creamy
feel
overall
a
nice
little
bit
o
darkness
nothin
too
dark
but
something
easily
drinkable
and
enjoyable
especially
given
the
morethanreasonable
pricetag
overall
this
is
not
a
bad
beer
at
all
especially
for
the
style
on
a
cool
fall
night
i
would
have
no
problem
drinking
a
handfull
of
these
taste
more
tobacco
a
little
bit
of
bitterness
undesired
in
a
cream
style
beer
roasted
malt
and
tobacco
rule
here
no
hops
alcohol
and
bitterness
way
too
amped
up
in
the
mouthfeel
for
this
style
coffee
even
seems
to
come
into
this
pass
this
is
a
perfect
example
of
a
dark
creamy
lager
its
velvety
and
smooth
and
chocolaty
without
a
burned
flavor
in
most
dark
beers
smooth
doesnt
even
cover
it
really
it
truly
creamy
the
empty
bottle
is
up
on
my
shelf
as
examples
of
great
beers
right
next
to
midas
touch
sunset
wheat
and
cherry
wheat
something
i
would
recommend
to
a
friend
who
doesnt
know
what
real
beer
is
but
wants
a
great
introduction
probably
not
but
the
point
is
its
an
amazing
beer
8
thanks
to
tom
h
for
the
leinies
sampler
i
suppose
this
brew
epitomizes
what
you
would
normally
expect
from
leinenkugels
its
an
attempt
at
something
different
but
it
doesnt
quite
blow
you
away
because
it
falls
just
short
its
good
but
not
great
this
was
an
awesome
beer
to
use
for
boiling
bratwurst
but
its
not
an
excellent
beer
for
drinking
now
i
would
much
rather
have
this
than
some
other
macro
but
i
wouldnt
quite
say
that
it
does
the
style
justice
again
its
a
good
beer
but
not
a
great
example
of
what
it
aims
to
be
d
fairly
easy
to
drink
but
theres
just
not
a
lot
going
on
i
poured
into
a
pint
glass
to
three
fingers
of
off
white
head
it
is
a
really
dark
rust
color
reminiscent
of
a
bock
it
has
a
sweet
grainy
smell
the
taste
is
of
a
lager
but
there
is
a
roasted
malt
character
to
it
as
well
it
has
a
watery
mouthfeel
i
remember
liking
this
beer
a
few
years
ago
i
would
still
choose
it
over
a
bmc
but
my
palate
does
not
respect
lagers
the
way
it
used
to
d
easy
to
drink
no
alcohol
bite
no
hops
bite
decent
taste
drink
em
up
notes
not
really
great
but
not
bad
either
an
unfortunate
middle
of
the
road
dark
lager
without
much
flavor
not
bad
feel
like
it
could
2
or
3
in
a
row
at
most
not
a
whole
lot
to
uncover
mouthfeel
roast
may
start
to
wear
wouldve
sworn
this
was
a
schwarzbier
but
what
do
i
know
overall
basically
all
of
the
leinenkugels
ive
ever
had
fall
into
the
same
category
of
good
to
very
good
ive
yet
to
discover
one
thats
absolutely
outstanding
i
definitely
will
not
knock
this
brewer
its
a
good
option
and
you
can
expect
goodness
d
refreshingly
good
could
very
easily
drink
this
one
everyday
this
is
a
decently
drinkable
brew
i
have
a
feeling
leinenkugels
take
pride
on
brewing
beers
that
are
simple
yet
drinkable
i
dont
care
who
owns
or
distributes
this
beer
it
is
allright
with
me
poured
into
a
shaker
pint
pours
a
clear
chestnut
brown
with
a
big
creamy
head
that
hangs
around
a
while
before
going
into
a
film
with
pretty
good
lacing
aroma
reminds
me
of
a
water
down
version
of
their
fireside
nut
brown
ale
burnt
malts
burnt
malt
taste
with
a
hint
of
citrus
and
a
bit
of
hops
this
tastes
like
a
beer
that
wants
to
be
more
but
just
does
not
get
there
drinkable
drinkability
eh
its
okay
i
guess
a
light
counterpart
to
the
rest
of
leinenkugels
fruity
pebblestasting
lineup
paired
well
with
watching
a
program
about
jimmy
stewart
pbs
dpretty
easy
to
drink
but
not
a
lot
of
character
here
seems
to
be
a
defining
characteristic
of
leinenkugel
beers
i
could
see
it
being
a
great
gateway
beer
though
as
its
more
complex
than
adjunct
lagers
and
but
isnt
too
complex
overall
and
me
being
a
big
fan
of
leinies
in
general
think
this
is
one
of
their
better
offerings
better
than
anything
that
comes
to
mind
from
this
category
that
i
tried
while
in
europe
cheaper
too
stylewise
its
nice
but
i
wouldnt
consider
it
a
goto
i
have
to
say
this
brew
looked
great
but
fell
a
bit
flat
in
the
flavor
department
the
nearly
black
substance
filling
my
perfect
pour
glass
with
1
5
fingers
of
head
and
when
it
settled
it
made
a
shape
resembling
the
bahama
islands
the
aroma
had
a
hint
of
malt
with
toffee
the
taste
and
body
were
a
bit
weak
and
unimpressive
it
wasnt
too
bad
but
i
wont
go
out
of
my
way
to
get
one
drinkability
a
winner
from
leinenkugel
this
a
perfectly
drinkable
light
beer
the
coffee
taste
is
pleasing
and
i
love
the
multiple
flavors
in
this
beer
i
could
have
two
or
three
a
clear
brown
pour
with
a
foamy
two
finger
off
white
head
some
spotty
lacing
medium
to
high
carbonation
aroma
of
slightly
burnt
caramel
roasted
malts
a
bit
of
chocolate
some
small
metallic
hints
probably
from
the
carbonation
flavor
is
roasty
and
slightly
tannic
hints
of
chocolate
and
walnut
shells
light
body
with
a
watery
mouthfeel
smooth
slightly
roasty
finish
as
promised
quite
sessionable
and
a
decent
offering
d
a
standard
euro
lager
that
doesnt
offer
too
much
on
the
nose
or
palate
but
is
fairly
drinkable
would
be
good
for
some
sunday
football
i
suppose
this
brew
is
well
balanced
crisp
and
revitalizes
the
palate
quite
well
i
would
venture
to
say
this
would
hold
up
well
with
any
german
schwarz
black
beer
drinkablity
tasty
and
sessionable
well
crafted
brew
do
the
chickens
have
large
talons
i
have
noticed
for
the
first
time
just
how
similar
all
the
leinie
brews
taste
i
bought
one
of
the
explorer
12
pks
and
went
through
on
of
each
flavor
in
the
course
of
an
afternoon
and
evening
i
really
am
not
as
impressed
as
when
i
was
a
young
guy
and
a
trip
to
chippewa
falls
for
free
tour
and
beer
was
something
to
look
forward
too
taste
is
mildly
sweet
malt
with
a
surprising
amount
of
fruitiness
for
a
lager
burnt
toast
flavor
is
a
bit
of
a
turnoff
and
there
is
really
not
much
else
to
support
it
except
a
bit
of
stale
malt
cardboard
the
quantity
of
flavor
is
pretty
low
so
it
is
easier
to
put
down
than
my
review
makes
it
sound
i
dont
think
i
will
be
purchasing
much
of
this
one
in
the
future
creamy
dark
is
one
of
4
beers
from
leinenkugels
explorer
variety
pack
and
is
my
favorite
sure
worth
a
try
if
you
are
looking
for
a
brewed
in
america
dark
lager
ive
been
waiting
a
year
for
leinenkugels
to
get
this
one
to
our
area
thus
i
was
happy
to
see
the
sampler
12
pack
in
the
stores
last
weekend
to
date
leinies
has
been
hit
and
miss
so
i
had
high
hopes
for
creamy
dark
fortunately
it
was
pretty
good
dark
cola
color
in
the
glass
with
a
creamy
head
that
offered
some
lacing
roasted
dunkel
malt
in
the
nose
that
remained
in
the
first
taste
mellowing
to
a
fairly
robust
nutty
roast
malt
with
an
odd
charcoalcardboard
offtaste
that
detracted
from
though
it
didnt
quite
eliminate
the
positive
drinkability
the
sip
ended
with
a
hint
of
hops
bitterness
the
thinner
body
made
it
refreshing
but
less
satisfying
and
an
astringent
alcohol
scent
permeated
the
nose
during
the
last
few
warm
sips
at
the
bottom
of
the
glass
so
for
leinies
it
was
good
but
there
are
far
better
craft
dunkels
out
there
despite
the
fairly
aggressive
carbonation
and
relative
thinness
it
does
have
a
decent
dark
character
and
enough
balance
to
make
it
an
easydrinking
enough
beer
not
as
sweet
as
the
other
offerings
ive
had
from
this
brewery
though
sweet
enough
for
the
style
while
this
is
certainly
not
a
hopcentric
style
i
do
with
they
would
dump
the
bland
cluster
hops
in
the
end
this
beer
does
have
a
malty
but
balanced
character
and
with
less
fizz
and
more
body
could
be
much
better
another
easy
drinking
brew
from
lienies
not
sure
about
the
creamypart
it
tastes
somewhat
like
a
hobgoblin
nuttyhint
of
dusted
cocoa
a
carbonated
crisp
finish
very
light
hop
note
as
i
said
in
other
lienies
reviews
their
beers
are
a
bit
lighter
then
what
type
of
beer
it
is
for
a
world
of
big
beers
high
hops
and
malt
and
other
flavorings
this
beer
is
great
to
go
back
to
and
relax
my
pallet
and
not
in
a
bad
way
very
drinkable
o
respectable
showing
from
this
wisconsin
based
regional
brewer
since
1867
but
nothing
that
jumps
out
to
separate
itself
from
other
craft
brews
drinkability
a
pretty
bland
lager
doesnt
have
much
taste
or
flavor
to
speak
of
leinenkugels
has
a
fairly
disappointing
lineup
and
this
beer
falls
squarely
into
that
category
im
not
all
that
familiar
with
the
euro
dark
lager
style
as
far
as
i
know
this
is
the
only
one
i
have
ever
tried
not
bad
looking
beer
dark
brown
to
black
translucent
with
some
faint
rust
clolored
hues
white
moderate
head
with
ok
lacing
not
much
in
the
way
of
smell
some
understated
sweet
roasted
somewhat
smokey
notes
but
nothing
really
grabs
you
taste
is
kind
of
the
same
some
bittersweet
chocolatey
roasted
malty
flavors
not
much
in
the
way
of
a
hop
presance
smooth
but
nothing
all
that
great
my
impression
of
this
beer
was
that
it
was
almost
like
a
porter
light
the
flavors
kind
of
remind
you
of
a
porter
but
not
really
its
not
bad
its
pretty
smooth
and
drinkable
it
does
have
a
thick
creamy
mouthfeel
as
advertised
not
a
bad
beer
but
i
wouldnt
go
out
of
my
way
for
one
pretty
forgetable
ive
tried
this
on
in
the
past
and
knew
that
it
was
a
decent
above
average
beer
i
recently
bought
the
leines
explorer
pack
and
this
is
far
and
away
my
favorite
in
there
fall
pack
with
the
oktoberfest
i
would
buy
this
one
again
but
as
a
solo
6pack
as
the
rest
of
the
beers
included
are
not
anything
special
nice
easy
drinker
easy
to
drink
but
has
no
lasting
taste
or
complexity
to
it
interesting
making
the
beer
underwhelming
this
beer
is
too
simple
but
there
is
malt
a
light
roast
and
amber
color
vagueness
that
lingers
little
watery
could
have
another
but
wont
my
friend
left
me
a
whats
left
of
a
12
pack
might
use
it
for
cooking
or
tomato
beer
ed
notes
tastes
good
as
tomato
beer
combo
if
you
get
bored
drinking
it
straight
overall
this
is
a
completely
average
dark
lager
i
wish
they
would
have
attempted
to
add
more
flavor
to
the
brew
however
i
will
say
this
is
my
favorite
leiny
product
i
could
sit
here
and
drink
these
beers
all
night
however
it
lacks
the
flavor
and
complexity
of
something
that
would
make
me
want
to
go
to
the
fridge
or
store
and
get
another
certainly
a
drinkable
beer
a
good
option
from
the
leine
brand
i
could
drink
quite
a
few
of
these
no
problem
this
is
in
my
top
two
of
leinies
beers
that
ive
tried
nice
malty
aroma
but
surprisingly
not
creamy
that
is
the
name
isnt
it
a
letdown
from
a
brewery
that
is
my
fave
micromacro
from
north
america
more
body
and
complexity
neededyou
would
think
they
just
took
bottles
of
their
lager
and
added
caramel
coloring
after
extraaging
this
is
a
good
beer
though
not
what
i
remember
i
use
to
drink
this
all
the
time
either
my
tastes
have
changed
or
the
beer
has
changed
still
and
easy
beer
to
drink
definitely
worth
a
try
though
one
of
leinies
better
offerings
drink
very
sessionable
could
have
a
lot
of
them
i
think
this
is
a
good
drink
out
of
the
bottle
beer
you
are
not
going
to
miss
much
by
not
using
a
glass
and
yet
there
is
some
flavor
to
this
beer
certainly
drinkable
would
make
a
nice
addition
to
the
session
fare
at
a
family
gathering
or
a
decent
crossover
brew
not
much
here
though
however
to
hold
the
interest
of
the
dedicated
craft
beer
afficionado
glad
to
have
tried
it
probably
wont
again
unless
im
at
another
shitty
liquor
store
with
shitty
selection
hmmm
sounds
like
the
circumstances
that
lead
to
the
purchase
in
the
first
place
d
not
bad
at
all
but
just
bland
the
aroma
and
flavor
are
unexciting
which
lands
this
beer
in
a
meh
category
not
bad
but
not
something
id
ever
go
out
to
get
in
fact
i
dont
know
of
a
case
in
which
i
would
get
it
period
highly
drinkable
and
refreshing
this
beer
pours
a
clear
brown
color
the
head
is
an
inch
in
height
and
recedes
quickly
into
minimal
lacing
the
aroma
is
of
caramel
and
roasted
malt
it
is
a
very
pleasant
aroma
but
very
simple
too
the
taste
is
again
is
simple
yet
there
is
enough
there
to
make
it
nice
to
drink
the
mouthfeel
is
mediumlight
bodied
with
a
high
level
of
carbonation
from
a
beer
called
creamy
dark
i
would
expect
the
mouthfeel
is
be
a
lot
smoother
but
the
excess
carbonation
really
gets
in
the
way
of
that
overall
this
is
a
decent
beer
and
one
of
leinies
better
ones
i
could
drink
this
again
if
it
were
the
best
beer
available
pours
a
decent
dark
brownblack
with
some
very
nice
initial
head
and
a
bit
of
lacing
slight
malt
scent
not
much
there
but
nothing
bad
either
decent
taste
nice
maltiness
but
not
much
in
the
way
of
anything
dark
its
pretty
much
a
slightly
smoky
lager
goes
down
quite
smooth
definitely
not
disappointing
a
little
more
body
would
have
been
nice
but
its
quite
drinkable
im
a
bit
biased
to
leines
because
its
kind
of
a
family
favorite
both
sides
of
the
fam
from
wisco
but
this
one
is
imo
one
of
leines
best
offerings
and
as
always
redily
available
for
a
good
price
mouthfeeldrinkability
very
easy
to
drink
good
overall
it
is
very
drinkable
a
fairly
neutral
beer
with
dark
lager
qualities
drinkability
great
session
beer
this
drink
has
most
of
the
good
bold
flavors
that
many
superior
dark
beers
have
yet
less
bitterness
and
ethanol
this
is
a
great
accompaniment
to
italian
or
french
bread
and
butter
a
very
good
but
average
lager
pours
a
darkish
brown
with
a
clingy
head
subtle
hop
taste
there
is
a
crisp
finish
i
noticed
a
smokey
aftertaste
that
i
really
enjoyed
when
the
boys
at
my
local
hilo
beverage
have
nothing
good
and
im
in
a
pinch
i
usually
pull
the
trigger
on
this
one
poured
into
a
pint
chilled
glass
a
dark
red
pour
with
single
finger
non
creamy
head
that
quickly
subsides
just
could
not
get
into
this
beer
not
much
aroma
poor
on
taste
poor
on
mouth
feel
nothing
really
to
write
home
about
not
sure
if
i
would
try
this
again
good
pub
draft
that
is
one
of
my
top
rated
active
bottled
beers
of
the
dark
lager
style
pours
a
very
beautiful
clear
mahogany
with
a
warm
reddish
glow
creamy
beige
head
that
sticks
to
my
glass
nose
of
roasted
malt
lightbodied
almost
watery
with
distinct
lightly
sweet
accents
of
roasted
malt
and
an
almost
coffeeish
edge
basically
no
bitterness
rather
smooth
and
lovely
good
but
nothing
like
the
dunkels
from
across
the
pond
d
i
am
going
to
pick
up
a
sixer
of
this
stuff
asap
i
see
the
low
reviews
before
me
and
i
just
wonder
if
this
beer
is
better
from
the
tap
or
if
i
just
got
a
super
fresh
pour
anyway
i
liked
this
beer
and
thats
all
that
matters
this
brew
is
very
drinkable
another
good
beer
from
leines
not
overly
impressive
but
it
doesnt
disappoint
overall
not
bad
i
enjoyed
the
dark
fruit
and
mild
earthyness
a
decent
mild
session
beer
a
pretty
solid
euro
dark
lager
as
per
typical
macros
its
very
light
on
the
hops
overall
not
to
bad
of
a
beer
for
a
lager
but
not
something
id
drink
again
pours
medium
dark
amber
in
color
looks
nice
at
first
but
loses
nearly
all
its
head
fairly
quick
little
or
no
lace
either
the
smell
is
very
unique
and
difficult
to
place
howver
the
taste
resembles
roasted
almost
burt
almonds
the
burt
nutty
taste
is
a
bit
to
strong
for
my
taste
all
in
all
id
drink
this
beer
again
but
it
wouldnt
be
my
first
or
second
choice
this
beer
is
caught
between
a
marginal
macro
lager
and
a
legitimate
dark
lager
the
aroma
has
an
unfortunate
cooked
corn
smell
but
the
flavor
is
dominated
by
a
pairing
of
nutty
and
roasted
malt
flavor
that
are
quite
nice
its
a
shame
leinys
cant
follow
through
and
really
make
this
a
good
beer
still
quite
drink
despite
the
flaws
poured
hard
into
a
pint
glass
nice
clear
rick
dark
brown
color
with
a
light
tan
2
finger
head
that
quickly
disappeared
produced
a
well
developed
aroma
consisting
mainly
of
roasted
malt
with
a
bit
of
hop
the
flavor
wasnt
as
sweet
as
i
thought
id
would
be
kinda
of
a
burnt
woody
flavor
with
a
little
hop
on
the
finish
i
nice
drinking
beer
that
wasnt
overly
heavy
d
they
go
down
like
water
easy
but
nothing
in
the
excitement
department
d
not
quite
one
and
done
intersting
enough
and
drinkable
enough
its
a
clear
backup
beer
not
quite
balanced
enough
for
me
but
easy
to
drink
one
of
leines
better
beers
give
it
a
try
if
you
havent
already
this
is
also
a
good
beer
for
those
afraid
of
the
dark
rereviewing
this
brew
after
having
a
good
years
worth
of
reviewing
this
beer
poured
into
a
pint
glass
has
a
dark
brown
color
with
a
nice
1
12
inch
off
white
head
that
leaves
nice
lacing
the
smell
is
of
roasted
malt
with
hints
of
mild
caramel
and
chocolate
the
taste
is
similar
to
the
smell
some
burnt
chocolate
and
mile
sweetness
not
as
bold
of
flavor
as
some
dark
lagers
but
this
is
a
solid
brew
one
of
the
best
from
leinies
worth
it
from
a
local
brewery
worthy
of
a
drink
d
d
very
drinkable
dark
lager
this
is
one
of
my
favorite
american
dark
lagers
for
many
reasons
great
dark
amber
color
pours
well
into
a
glass
the
creamy
head
does
vanish
to
next
to
nothing
but
a
good
lacing
remains
the
aroma
is
real
nice
lots
of
malts
and
some
hops
can
easily
be
detected
good
roasted
flavor
along
with
some
chocolate
and
maybe
a
bit
of
licorice
finishes
strong
and
very
drinkable
this
is
a
quality
dunkel
that
goes
well
with
a
good
meal
or
simply
on
its
own
served
in
a
glass
from
a
12oz
bottle
the
beer
poured
a
dark
brown
forming
a
1
inch
tan
head
with
little
lacing
the
aroma
consisted
of
light
malts
and
grain
the
taste
was
a
smooth
mix
of
sweet
malts
and
light
grain
not
at
all
complex
mouthfeel
was
medium
and
smooth
this
beer
had
a
decent
flavor
for
a
lager
and
low
alcohol
to
make
it
an
easy
drinker
overall
this
beer
wasnt
bad
while
i
wouldnt
want
to
drink
this
all
night
one
here
and
there
would
be
good
especially
on
a
hot
summer
day
worth
a
try
this
creamy
lager
is
dark
but
not
creamy
it
poured
a
decent
brown
with
a
marginal
head
the
nose
has
some
mild
malts
and
light
sweetness
the
taste
was
a
bit
grainier
than
i
expected
just
not
much
going
on
here
a
watery
body
has
lots
of
carbonation
not
very
enjoyable
this
beer
was
just
a
tad
above
average
and
one
i
would
drink
on
future
occasions
drinkability
is
very
much
a
good
thing
this
is
a
great
lighter
beer
that
you
an
serve
off
the
tap
at
a
barbeque
and
not
have
too
may
people
sleeping
on
your
couch
this
is
one
of
my
favorites
from
leinenkugels
while
it
doesnt
compare
to
many
craft
and
microbrews
it
is
exceptional
for
a
mass
produced
beer
it
has
a
nice
head
with
a
very
smooth
taste
it
is
a
darker
beer
that
i
think
even
people
who
prefer
lighter
beers
could
get
into
pours
very
transluscent
dark
brown
with
a
small
offwhite
head
light
roasted
malt
and
cardboard
on
the
nose
mostly
flavor
is
very
cardboard
like
with
a
very
thin
watery
body
some
roastiness
is
showing
but
i
guess
a
decent
amount
for
an
american
dark
lager
not
very
good
overall
though
but
drinkable
for
a
leinenkugel
mainstream
beer
this
is
actually
one
of
their
more
quaffable
offerings
keeping
to
the
tradition
of
a
dark
lager
it
has
the
crispness
and
smooth
lager
qualities
the
taste
finishes
with
a
slight
hop
flavor
very
subtle
and
has
an
almost
toffeish
malt
characteristic
to
it
of
all
the
leinies
styles
offered
this
is
one
of
the
beers
that
is
worth
a
taste
all
in
all
not
a
bad
offering
from
leinenkugel
but
i
wont
be
searching
for
this
beer
again
any
time
soon
note
i
hoist
this
fine
brew
in
honor
of
brett
farve
retiring
today
heres
to
you
brett
i
would
rate
it
about
the
same
except
for
the
taste
would
down
grade
it
a
bit
i
will
try
it
in
this
style
once
more
just
to
see
this
is
a
really
good
beer
it
could
be
on
of
my
regulars
not
a
mindblower
but
some
good
flavor
at
a
reasonable
price
overall
better
than
i
thought
it
would
be
i
wouldnt
mind
having
this
one
again
when
i
am
not
in
the
mood
for
something
complex
and
just
enjoying
a
good
time
with
friends
but
will
i
stock
my
fridge
with
it
no
cant
drink
many
of
these
in
fact
i
got
a
lenies
sampler
as
a
present
and
would
not
buy
this
again
a
drinkable
beer
smells
hoppy
taste
is
crisp
of
smokey
in
chracter
but
not
bitter
in
taste
mouthfeel
is
just
average
easy
to
swallow
it
is
however
a
very
drinkable
lager
but
not
one
id
go
out
of
my
way
to
get
again
this
beer
would
be
appropriate
to
accompany
a
hot
milk
cake
with
chocolate
icing
mouthfeel
drinkability
the
mouthfeel
was
ok
but
was
definitely
just
your
average
lager
i
dont
intend
on
many
more
of
these
drinkability
is
great
a
few
of
these
would
not
hurt
any
beer
advocate
cheers
poured
a
very
attractive
dark
brown
color
with
decent
head
that
dissipated
slowly
aroma
was
of
roasted
maltiness
with
hints
of
chocolate
and
coffee
flavor
is
also
malty
that
is
well
balanced
by
a
suprising
hoppiness
mouthfeel
is
good
and
lacing
on
glass
is
decent
very
drinkable
beer
i
would
def
not
purchase
a
six
pack
of
it
for
recreational
drinking
d
i
guess
i
expected
more
from
leinenkugel
on
this
one
there
just
wasnt
enough
flavor
to
get
me
to
buy
these
and
not
some
other
dark
beer
this
is
by
far
my
favorite
leinies
beer
its
dark
but
its
pretty
thin
and
easydrinking
i
love
the
deep
brownblack
color
and
the
wonderful
toastedcaramel
aroma
creamy
dark
is
extremely
smooth
in
the
mouthfeel
department
perhaps
a
bit
thin
but
it
makes
that
5th
and
6th
pint
very
easy
to
drink
the
flavor
is
not
overwhelming
but
very
tasty
and
again
caramelly
try
this
beer
if
youre
new
to
the
leinenkugel
stable
its
a
very
dark
reddishbrown
beer
with
a
nice
head
and
almost
no
lacing
and
it
has
some
mild
carbonation
smells
like
roasted
nuts
and
chocolate
and
wheat
bread
its
pretty
smooth
and
has
a
semicrisp
taste
followed
by
a
slightly
bitter
aftertaste
its
not
a
full
bodied
beer
after
i
let
it
warm
up
a
bit
the
bitter
aftertaste
seemed
to
mellow
out
a
bit
d
itll
do
ina
pinch
but
just
slighty
better
than
your
average
macro
its
dark
and
unoffensivemight
be
good
training
beer
for
the
masses
first
sip
carries
a
mild
astringency
grainy
with
a
minor
roast
note
and
low
level
sweetness
in
the
aftertaste
fairly
clean
but
bland
mouthfeel
has
adequate
carbonation
but
its
a
bit
watery
papery
dry
aftertaste
something
about
this
beer
makes
you
want
to
just
throw
it
back
without
pondering
it
at
all
not
good
its
easy
enough
to
drink
but
im
glad
i
didnt
buy
the
sample
flavor
is
toasty
roasted
and
bitter
dry
finish
with
hints
of
sweeter
fruits
hidden
in
the
background
d
easy
to
drink
could
have
a
few
of
these
in
one
sitting
overall
this
brew
isnt
bad
but
it
isnt
good
if
you
had
this
on
tap
along
with
your
typical
macros
i
would
go
for
it
but
if
you
are
in
a
shop
looking
for
a
6
pack
there
are
many
better
beers
though
this
brewery
is
usually
priced
about
right
one
of
my
favorites
from
leines
smells
nice
and
dark
with
some
roasty
malts
nice
dark
flavors
with
roasted
malts
and
carmels
and
woodybarky
type
flavors
mouthfeel
is
creamy
but
finishes
a
bit
lacking
all
in
all
pretty
drinkable
though
not
as
complex
as
id
like
edit
after
tasting
many
more
beers
this
is
good
but
not
as
great
as
i
thought
it
was
drinkability
a
nice
mild
beer
for
a
dark
beer
would
go
great
with
a
meaty
dish
subtle
weakish
notes
of
a
nutty
malt
taste
is
along
the
lines
of
a
fizzy
root
beer
but
with
enough
hops
to
balance
it
out
and
add
a
bit
of
a
bite
at
the
finish
a
dark
beer
thats
not
too
heavy
and
light
enough
with
the
alcohol
to
push
it
to
session
status
finish
is
okay
but
not
what
you
would
hope
for
with
a
dark
lager
if
im
going
to
drink
much
dark
beer
i
think
ill
go
all
the
way
to
a
stout
overall
this
is
a
nice
no
brainer
of
a
beer
some
strongish
flavors
but
not
the
most
enjoyable
to
just
sip
on
a
good
session
beer
i
guess
it
is
a
lager
afterall
that
says
all
a
pretty
good
beer
drinkability
this
would
be
a
good
beer
to
have
when
you
anticipate
on
having
a
lot
it
wont
fill
you
up
it
tastes
ok
on
the
lighter
tastewise
side
but
if
thats
your
thing
go
for
it
overall
impression
this
beer
is
not
the
best
of
its
style
out
there
but
for
the
price
its
quite
a
good
offering
overall
this
is
a
very
good
brew
i
enjoyed
it
a
lot
but
can
not
see
myself
drinking
it
on
a
daily
basis
of
that
sunset
wheat
there
d
not
very
good
with
the
long
haul
lowenbrau
bubbly
head

it
had
been
quite
a

years
since
i
had
one
of
these
beers
and
while
it
wasnt
bad
but
when
they
are
less
than
a
buck
a
peice
at
the

its
kind
of

bubbly
head
that
dissipates
quickly
but
clings
a
bit
nose
seemed
more
grainy
than
dark
d
the
creaminess
makes
it
a
little
hard
but
the
flavor
is
light
enough
to
accomodate
it
i
wouldnt
go
out
of
my
way
to
try
this
but
when
presented
with
the
opportunity
i
found
it
to
be
a
drinkable
brew
drinkability
this
is
by
far
leines
best
product
good
tasting
drinkable
and
honestly
described
unlike
leines
doppelbock
not
a
great
deal
of
complexity
but
a
darn
tasty
lager
from
a
large
producer
drinkability
light
and
lively
this
one
is
an
easy
drinker
one
of
those
beers
that
may
look
imposing
due
to
its
dark
color
but
is
anice
easy
drinking
lager
i
am
pleased
with
this
brew
and
it
will
likely
find
its
way
into
my
fridge
again
i
poured
this
beer
poured
into
a
0
4
liter
schooner
and
it
resulted
in
a
1
5
cm
tan
head
that
held
up
for
a
few
minutes
then
dissapated
to
2
mm
the
color
of
the
beer
is
a
chocolate
brown
the
smell
is
a
roasted
graincoffee
mocha
most
dark
beers
are
much
heavier
than
this
beer
and
it
has
a
crisp
taste
for
a
dark
beer
the
flavor
however
is
abundant
with
roasted
overtones
and
a
sweet
hoppy
undertone
this
beer
has
a
sparkly
mouthfeel
and
is
very
light
and
refreshing
best
to
be
dranken
very
cold
the
price
is
right
for
this
beer
it
came
in
a
case
of
24
with
three
other
leinie
flavors
for
18
if
your
looking
for
a
heavy
stout
this
isnt
your
beer
but
if
your
looking
for
a
refreshing
crispy
beer
with
dark
beer
flavor
this
is
your
ticket
while
in
detroit
visiting
i
bought
a
case
of
leinenkugel
at
a
costco
their
red
ale
has
been
a
favorite
of
mine
and
sorry
to
say
it
is
not
available
in
san
diego
i
am
currently
in
vietnam
until
apr
06
there
are
some
brew
pubs
here
now
putting
out
black
beer
which
reminds
me
of
sam
adams
black
lager
and
leinenkugel
dark
pours
dark
brown
with
brown
head
that
disappear
fairly
fast
but
left
evidence
of
its
existence
by
good
amount
of
lacing
there
is
some
taste
to
this
lager
in
the
form
of
roasted
malt
it
has
a
watery
mouthfeel
the
finish
was
clean
i
cant
say
this
beer
overly
excites
me
but
i
really
cant
knock
it
either
it
should
be
rated
worth
a
try
rather
than
not
recommended
this
beer
pours
a
nearly
not
quite
opaque
dark
brown
with
a
decent
if
not
long
lasting
tan
head
some
sticky
lace
in
the
pint
glass
and
a
table
of
bubbles
smell
is
mild
roasted
malt
with
corn
odors
at
least
this
doesnt
have
the
horse
piss
smell
of
many
euro
lagers
mouthfeel
is
thin
just
too
thin
drinkability
is
fine
if
you
are
looking
for
stamina
and
not
flavor
it
isnt
terrible
but
it
isnt
good
either
this
beer
is
supersmooth
but
still
has
an
excellent
bold
flavor
i
think
this
is
a
truly
unique
beer
ata
great
price
and
a
good
session
beer
for
the
cooler
months
this
isnt
a
world
class
beer
but
something
about
it
makes
it
pretty
darn
good
poured
out
to
a
darker
brown
color
with
a
well
formed
12
inch
head
and
some
notes
of
lacing
medium
level
of
carbonation
smell
was
rather
weak
overall
but
not
absent
aromas
of
roasted
nuts
and
wood
with
a
trace
of
aged
cheese
were
noted
and
overall
light
taste
was
decent
flavors
of
lightly
roasted
malts
mild
grains
and
maple
wood
nice
mouthfeel
was
appropriate
for
the
style
medium
bodied
smooth
and
creamy
a
good
level
of
drinkability
this
is
a
very
well
made
mass
produced
beer
at
an
inexpensive
price
good
for
the
fall
months
recommended
the
beer
is
ruby
tinged
and
has
an
opaque
creamy
head
it
has
a
nice
roasted
malt
and
chocolate
aroma
the
flavor
is
of
hazelnut
and
chocolate
with
the
roasted
flavor
coming
through
on
the
finish
the
body
of
this
beer
is
somewhat
thin
all
in
all
this
is
a
very
nice
and
drinkable
dark
beer
that
is
a
good
value
for
the
price
a
definite
fridge
filler
and
a
good
gateway
brew
for
our
macrobrew
loving
friends
notes
try
this
one
with
strawberries
and
chocolate
some
time
strawberries
really
improve
this
beer
and
this
beer
those
strawberries
smooth
with
just
enough
bitterness
so
is
this
a
macro
and
if
so
it
is
too
damn
expensive
i
mean
it
is
nice
but
for
6
bucks
they
serve
this
beer
on
tap
on
the
ss
badger
a
ferry
that
riuns
from
michigan
to
wisconsin
poured
a
dark
brown
with
smallish
brown
head
and
low
carbonation
could
have
been
the
plastic
cup
nose
hints
of
malty
sweetness
which
will
turn
out
to
be
a
tease
malt
sweetness
in
the
flavor
smooth
and
light
in
body
but
then
a
big
malt
taste
appears
for
a
short
time
before
the
slightly
malty
aftertaste
comes
in
pours
a
very
dark
brown
color
from
the
tap
with
an
average
sized
foamy
head
that
i
had
figured
would
be
a
little
darker
the
scents
are
of
coffee
and
sweet
malts
the
flavor
is
respectable
strong
coffee
flavors
with
accents
of
bittersweet
chocolate
and
probably
more
coffee
i
notice
the
mouthfeel
to
be
a
little
slim
at
first
but
as
i
get
half
way
through
the
beer
i
begin
to
change
my
mind
it
could
be
the
dark
color
that
made
me
expect
this
one
to
go
down
like
tar
maybe
a
mediumbodied
beer
here
i
really
wouldnt
want
it
much
heavier
the
drinkability
is
good
as
well
it
would
take
quite
a
few
of
these
before
i
got
tired
of
them
worth
a
try
cheers
the
name
is
a
bit
baffling

not
a
stout
not
a
porter
just
dark
and
creamy
beer
appearance
is
dark
amber
with
a
touch
of
copper
a
beige
head
that
sticks
around
and
leaves
some
lace
aroma
is
as
advertised
creamy
with
a
hint
of
malt
initial
taste
promises
to
be
full
and
good
but
quickly
reneges
on
its
promise
and
goes
nowhere
malt
caramel
and
water
light
body
weak
carbonation
finishing
with
a
whimper
pass
the
appearance
is
solid
dark
brown
with
a
disappointing
head
both
the
smell
and
the
taste
can
be
summed
up
by
one
word
with
one
capital
letter
coffee
the
taste
has
the
dark
chocolate
overtones
of
strong
coffee
this
is
followed
by
a
brief
blast
of
coffee
bitterness
finish
is
clean
not
a
bad
beer
but
nothing
to
write
home
about
drinkability
not
a
bad
session
beer
especially
for
the
price
definitely
drinkable
an
adequate
flanker
for
the
miller
machine
drinkabilitythis
beer
has
a
high
drinkability
given
that
the
taste
vanishes
quickly
with
no
taste
if
there
was
a
budweiser
stout
this
would
be
it
yuck
poured
from
a
12
oz
bottle
5
99
for
a
6pack
at
the
local
tops
supermarket
this
does
indeed
appear
quite
dark
and
is
slightly
opaque
with
a
121
thin
head
that
fades
after
a
while
leaving
some
lacing
on
the
glass
smell
and
taste
are
not
very
distinctive
nose
consists
of
some
malt
some
alcohol
and
a
slight
yeast
odor
maybe
a
little
citrus
the
taste
is
slightly
smoky
with
a
little
bit
of
hops
again
nothing
too
distinctive
mouthfeel
is
not
creamy
at
all
rather
watery
and
thin
with
light
to
moderate
carbonation
the
most
distinctive
aspect
of
this
brew
is
of
all
things
the
grapefruit
aftertaste
which
i
find
odd
and
not
all
that
pleasant
it
was
good
to
try
but
i
wont
be
buying
this
again
another
great
beer
that
sold
out
the
sab
monster
this
is
a
nice
diversion
beer
when
you
are
out
at
a
restaurant
in
some
wisconsin
areas
this
is
a
very
dark
brown
leather
with
a
nice
malty
body
to
it
and
a
caramel
finish
as
far
as
the
current
leinenkugel
lineup
goes
this
is
probably
my
favorite
if
looking
for
something
other
than
the
utterly
gross
berry
weiss
and
honey
weiss
from
leinies
go
for
this
one
12
ouncer
sampled
wo
any
freshness
indication
on
the
labelbottle
pours
dark
maple
syrup
in
color
off
white
head
disolving
to
a
tiny
bubble
film
this
left
behind
some
middle
of
the
road
lacing
ho
hum
so
far
the
nose
highlighted
some
maple
syrup
and
molasas
flavor
notes
included
some
caramel
and
lighly
roasted
malts
smooth
mouthfeel
but
a
bit
thin
and
watery
this
is
a
decent
lower
cost
brew
basically
malty
wo
much
of
a
hop
presence
dark
beer
with
training
wheels
overall
a
good
beer
if
youre
in
the
mood
for
something
above
a
heineken
you
dont
have
to
put
too
much
thought
into
this
beer
which
is
why
i
buy
it
on
occasion
it
actually
makes
a
good
summer
alternative
drinkable
i
guess
i
wouldnt
get
another
next
time
ill
just
stick
to
soda
the
beer
pours
a
translucent
dark
brown
color
with
a
thick
frothy
tan
head
that
slowly
fades
to
lacing
the
aroma
is
decent
it
has
a
very
dry
roasted
scent
with
lots
of
caramel
malts
and
a
lager
yeast
aroma
the
taste
average
it
has
a
very
bland
and
dry
flavor
that
goes
down
slow
and
finishes
weak
and
watery
it
has
some
caramel
malt
sweetness
but
it
is
roasted
and
dry
with
a
mustybitter
aftertaste
the
mouthfeel
is
decent
it
is
a
lowmedium
bodied
beer
with
good
carbonation
this
is
an
average
dark
lager
it
has
decent
aroma
but
average
flavor
its
one
and
done
for
me
at
6
99
a
sixpack
i
could
definitely
find
a
better
beer
on
which
to
spend
my
money
this
beer
is
a
very
dark
brownish
red
with
a
mediumsized
offwhite
creamy
head
that
quickly
diminished
to
a
2mmthick
film
that
stuck
around
until
almost
the
end
some
specks
of
lacing
but
not
much
the
aroma
is
mild
roasted
malt
and
corn
with
hints
of
grass
and
resin
taste
was
a
little
more
interesting
a
little
grainy
still
malty
and
maybe
a
little
nutty
nothing
special
but
not
bad
the
finish
was
odd
a
little
sweet
lightly
bitter
and
possibly
a
hint
of
cherry
or
maybe
thats
just
in
my
head
it
has
a
watery
mouthfeel
but
theres
kind
of
a
chalkiness
toward
the
end
thats
the
odd
part
otherwise
it
was
fairly
drinkable
not
my
favorite
leinie
by
any
means
and
i
doubt
ill
buy
it
again
but
its
not
bad
just
average
highest
quality
roasted
malt
combined
with
a
hint
of
chocolate
but
comes
off
a
bit
on
the
thin
side
slightly
watery
to
average
moutfhfeel

really
this
would

beer
not
terrible
as
an
unthoughtworthy
quaffer
but
dont
get
excited
had
it
on
tap
at
buffalo
wild
wings
whose
only
decent
beers
on

were
of
the
leines
ilk
this
beer
has
the
least
clever
name
ever
this
beer
is
creamy
and
dark
i
dont
even
know
what
style
they
were
going
for
when
they
made
this
but
it
is
average
overall
better
than
berry
and
honey
weiss
not
as
good
as
red
or
oktoberfest
one
of
leines
better
offerings
and
i
will
continue
to
drink
it
as
my
fatherinlaw
buys
it
mouthfeel
is
average
while
drinkability
is
decent
this
is
not
a
beer
i
would
expect
this
brewery
to
make
given
the
rest
of
their
stable
still
it
is
a
decent
stab
at
a
style
that
is
often
overlooked
this
wasnt
that
great
of
a
beer
an
average
apperance
that
didnt
really
say
much
about
the
beer
it
had
a
small
head
that
discipated
there
was
a
nice
malty
flavor
to
the
beer
but
had
a
bad
after
taste
that
turned
me
off
to
it
not
a
bad
beer
but
i
can
definitely
do
without
this
one
had
this
one
on
tap
during
a
recent
business
trip
appearance
is
dark
and
solid
with
an
appreciably
thick
lasting
head
aroma
is
slightly
of
mixed
grains
and
malt
first
taste
is
slightly
sweet

less
than
i
anticipated
somewhat
watery
but
nicely
drinkable
worth
having
if
theres
nothing
but
macros
on
the
menu
but
not
worth
going
out
of
your
way
to
try
for
a
dunkel
this
beer
is
lacking
in
its
nose
and
flavor
it
poured
a
small
sized
tan
head
that
contained
finesmall
bubbles
that
quickly
dissipated
the
body
was
so
dark
brown
that
i
could
not
tell
if
there
was
any
carbonation
in
this
beer
the
nose
was
malty
with
a
light
roasted
nose
the
flavor
was
too
mild
for
a
dunkel
and
it
was
lightly
chocolate
the
mouthfeel
was
smooth

thin
with
a

there
was
fair

with
this

the

down

special
here
but
i
am
glad
we
met
this
is
a
very
nice
leinies
that
is
quite
enjoyable
the
appearance
is
quite
nice
being
dark
brown
with
red
highlights
and
a
tan
head
decent
lacing
along
the
journey
through
this
glass
roasted
malt
nose
and
a
decent
malt
sense
in
the
taste
somewhat
thin
body
but
it
has
a
nice
finish
that
is
fairly
dry
overall
a
quality
dark
lager
but
nothing
special
i
remember
enjoying
this
beer
much
more
in
the
past
im
not
sure
if
they
altered
the
recipe
or
if
my
tastes
have
changed
either
way
you
look
at
it
rather
disappointing
ive
rated
a
bunch
of
beers
now
and
didnt
expect
to
like
this
one
that
much
but
really
to
me
it
is
a
decent
dunkel
and
worth
drinking
if
you
like
this
style
definitely
above
average
true
to
its
word
it
ia
a
very
creamy
dark
beervery
dark
brownblack
with
good
creamy
head
that
doesnt
stick
around
lond
chocolatey
aroma
smells
very
sweet
toasted
malty
taste
and
chocolatykinda
thin
after
a
few
drinks
pretty
good
beer
had
it
with
some
hot
wings
and
seemed
to
pair
up
pretty
good
color
was
a
nice
off
black
brown
with
some
offwhite
head
no
lace
smell
is
a
malty
caramel
roast
with
some
vanilla
notes
taste
is
a
balance
of
sweet
chocolatey
malt
and
roasted
malt
with
little
hop
presence
the
body
is
to
thin
and
light
and
could
be
more
flavored
its
smooth
and
light
somewhat
creamy
i
guess
nothing
stood
out
for
me
very
clean
light
and
roastly
sweet
not
bad
sweet
malts
with
some
dark
roasted
malts
hints
of
coffee
and
a
nice
chocolate
kick
make
this
a
pretty
good
brew
the
body
is
a
tad
thin
and
the
flavor
is
not
quite
as
full
as
it
should
be
it
is
very
smooth
with
light
carbonation
i
guess
you
could
say
creamy
it
is
also
very
drinkable
i
could
possibly
go
down
this
road
again
but
a
friend
brought
it
from
va
so
i
dont
think
i
will
see
it
any
time
soon
notes
its
tough
to
tell
what
leinny
is
doing
with
any
of
its
beers
evident
by
the
namecreamy
dark
lager
do
they
mean
a
stout
or
porter
this
is
more
of
a
light
porter
but
the
best
offering
by
leinenkugel
still
somewhat
on
the
average
side
probably
the
best
beer
that
leinenkugels
puts
out
this
is
pretty
close
to
being
a
schwarzbier
a
darn
good
american
dark
lager
which
you
dont
find
too
often
dark
brown
auburn
to
light
source
with
a
nice
light
brown
head
nutty
and
roasty
malt
aroma
and
flavor
possible
traces
of
a
cornish
aroma
but
so
slight
it
was
hard
to
tell
for
sure
and
it
certainly
did
not
detract
i
found
the
beer
to
be
on
the
lightbodied
side
but
certainly
creamy
leinenkugels
creamy
dark
lager
is
how
the
label
on
the
bottle
reads
but
this
beer
is
really
a
stout
this
is
a
very
attractive
beer
that
just
did
not
excite
my
tastebuds
it
was
rather
uninspiring
it
did
have
a
nice
rich
color
and
an
attractive
head
it
did
not
seem
creamy
at
all
and
it
had
a
peculiar
aftertaste
which
i
cant
quite
put
my
finger
on
but
it
was
almost
like
chocolate
flavored
lemon
juice
sounds
weird
but
thats
about
the
best
i
can
do
it
was
definitely
an
acidic
finish
not
one
of
my
favorites
and
not
one
i
will
try
again
soon
p
s
do
i
need
to
see
a
doctor
i
could
swear
that
the
mouthfeel
of
this
beer
was
plenty
thick
for
the
style
if
the
style
being
referring
to
is
american
dark
lager

i
am
nuts
pours
dark
brown
with
nice
tan
foamy
head
that
lingers
aroma
has
backdrop
of
perhaps
cluster
hops
on
malt
tang
taste
has
slight
chocolate
and
sweetness
followed
by
hop
bitterness
body
is
too
light
for
style
and
not
creamy
as
the
name
would
suggest
not
a
bad
beer
if
you
are
looking
for
something
with
more
depth
than
the
typical
macro
beer
largely
earthybrown
in
hue
slightly
darker
in
the
middle
but
it
doesnt
approach
black
golden
highlights
where
the
light
penetrates
it
thoroughly
sides
of
the
glass
for
example
the
tan
head
reached
a
modest
finger
in
height
it
held
well
enough
not
much
subsequent
lacing
was
produced
i
can
sumup
the
palate
in
one
word
odd
the
chocolate
malt
is
very
restrained
as
is
any
roasted
flavors
i
doubt
that
leinienkugel
was
aiming
for
roasted
flavors
but
the
absents
of
them
in
a
dark
lager
is
still
disappointing
there
is
a
faint
sweetness
too
maybe
oats
or
grits
caramel
malts
the
hops
taste
old
and
dull
and
kind
of
cheesy
in
taste
the
sweetness
and
cheese
flavor
are
the
origins
for
the
odd
taste
remark
the
mouthfeel
has
a
very
modest
creamy
sensation
maybe
oats
or
maybe
i
am
being
susceptible
medium
in
body
but
watery
and
thinner
that
need
be
it
is
easy
to
drink
because
it
is
easy
on
the
palate
i
often
resort
to
drinking
this
at
local
sporting
events
it
has
enough
flavor
to
keep
me
interested
but
not
enough
to
purchase
for
home
consumption
even
when
sixpacks
run
for
5
00
it
poured
nearly
black
with
a
thick
caramel
head
the
aroma
of
malt
was
present
though
not
overwhelming
the
flavor
also
contained
a
malty
sweetness
but
balanced
well
with
the
chocolate
flavors
present
i
gave
it
a
slightly
lower
mouthfeel
because
it
was
a
bit
thin
i
enjoy
this
beer
which
can
be
found
on
sale
quite
reasonably
some
times
the
beer
pours
a
dark
shade
of
ruby
and
throws
out
a
medium
brown
creamy
head
theres
a
nice
little
chocolatecoffee
aroma
to
this
beer
very
pleasant
the
taste
is
really
lacking
something
i
had
this
on
tap
a
year
ago
and
i
remember
it
being
quite
a
bit
better
the
taste
has
some
shades
of
cocoa
and
coffee
bean
a
very
small
amount
of
bitterness
coming
from
the
roasted
malt
i
believe
pretty
average
brew
here
very
impressive
color
and
aroma
smooth
pour
and
it
earns
the
creamy
moniker
as
i
was
surprised
how
smooth
it
was
for
a
dark
beer
my
first
dunkel
and
i
would
definitely
buy
again
my
friends
and
i
like
this
beer
its
thick
creamy
a
bit
cooked
creamy
head
doesnt
reflect
its
taste
in
the
smell
though
but
it
doesnt
smell
bad
dark
in
presentation
and
nice
smell
small
and
speedy
bubbles
short
dense
head
very
heavy
on
a
chocolate
taste
the
malts
are
obviously
chosen
for
this
effect
a
little
more
hop
would
also
help
very
one
dimensional
in
flavor
no
complexity
and
less
mouthfeel
than
implied
by
the
pour
nice
try
but
doesnt
make
it
regardless
i
found
this
simply
fantastic
o
meh
not
anything
special
on
tap
at
hopmonk
sebastol
location
a
smoked
beer
really
smoky
and
yet
smooth
creamy
black
coloured
great
drinkability
even
for
lunch
without
the
sweetness
or
peatiness
from
some
smoked
bears
its
the
death
on
taxes
on
smoke
heaven
steroids
notes
from
33
beers
notebook
very
floral
rather
than
overwhelming
smoke
aroma
taste
is
full
bodied
balanced
sweetbitter
hint
of
sour
very
clean
and
balanced
with
sweet
dark
fruits
plum
pudding
dark
toast
hints
of
chocolate
coffee
singed
leaves
it
is
highly
drinkable
and
excellent
d
very
drinkable
really
like
the
heavily
roasted
flavors
and
sweetness
interesting
mix
of
a
lager
but
it
turns
out
to
be
super
tasty
pours
essentially
black
in
color
with
a
finger
of
dense
khaki
head
a
nice
roast
and
chocolate
aroma
a
touch
of
earthy
hops
and
pine
some
slight
sweetness
on
the
nose
maybe
a
light
herbal
note
flavor
is
quite
earthy
and
roasty
with
a
subtle
bitterness
a
piney
and
herbal
hoppiness
to
it
medium
bodied
with
a
creamy
carbonation
and
mouthfeel
its
blackened
and
bitter
on
the
palate
the
malt
character
is
stoutlike
heavily
roasted
with
only
a
hint
of
sweetness
to
support
it
this
could
be
mistaken
for
a
stout
in
fact
except
that
theres
the
subtle
presence
of
sulfurous
lager
yeast
nuttiness
comes
out
more
in
the
finish
along
with
a
kick
of
burnt
and
bitter
malt
very
dry
and
somehow
even
refreshing
this
is
damn
impressive
stuff
d
tasty
has
a
decent
kick
to
it
and
its
filling
i
had
my
pint
and
was
happy
id
get
it
again
it
smelled
like
dark
chocolate
with
hints
of
coffee
the
taste
was
similar
with
the
added
heat
of
the
alcohol
the
mouth
feel
is
what
really
surprised
me
this
tasted
much
more
like
a
black
lager
than
death
taxes
very
drinkable
very
good
d
drinkability
pretty
high
very
good
and
not
too
intense
overall
this
an
awesome
schwarzbier
on
of
the
best
ive
tried
better
than
death
and
taxes
imo
this
is
the
kind
of
beer
that
is
often
reviewed
out
of
the
proper
perspective
it
isnt
high
alcohol
it
isnt
barrel
aged
and
it
isnt
bottled
and
wax
dipped
hence
most
wont
make
a
big
deal
over
it
however
it
is
absolutely
delicious
and
a
clean
relatively
low
alcohol
beer
like
this
is
a
lotto
winner
in
my
book
a
nice
clean
beer
with
bright
and
intense
roasted
malt
pretty
similar
to
a
german
schwarz
in
that
the
malt
is
clean
and
sort
of
one
dimensional
but
stronger
and
a
little
punchier
in
the
hops
department
somehow
seems
a
little
rougher
around
the
edges
than
death
and
taxes
but
along
the
same
lines
on
tap
at
the
red
in
santa
cruz
pitch
black
with
a
thin
mocha
head
that
leaves
filmy
lacing
boozy
brownie
mix
aroma
kinda
like
southern
tier
choklat
but
lighter
some
red
fruity
esters
too
flavor
is
light
milk
chocolate
sweetness
that
gets
trampled
by
more
bitter
dark
chocolate
dry
herbal
hop
finish
complements
the
roastiness
fluffy
body
light
but
flavorful
wellcrafted
beer
great
for
lovers
of
the
darkest
bitterest
chocolates
milk
chocolate
lager
this
was
a
very
dark
brown
beer
with
a
thick
tan
head
delicious
creamy
mouthfeel
supplemented
with
thick
head
this
tasted
to
me
like
a
lightbodied
chocolate
milk
ale
though
the
taste
was
fairly
dry
not
a
sugar
bomb
very
well
balanced
and
id
love
to
see
this
pop
up
more
around
the
bay
area
so
much
better
than
a
typical
6

abv
brew
i
see
this
is
tagged
a
schwarzbier
need
to
try
more
of
these
to
me
bony
fingers
sits
very
nicely
on
the
spectrum
between
a
dry
irish
stout
and
the
syrupysweet
american
version
whatever
the
style
i
could
drink
this
all

by
a
creamy

is

i
had
a
hard
time
trying
to
determine
what
style
of
beer
this
is
i
might
have
called
it
a
porter
the
folks
at
flavor
didnt
really
know
nice
place
but
some
of
the
bartenders
dont
get
beer
interesting
beer
i
think
it
great
he
brings
this
out
as
a
fall
seasonal
rather
than
the
traditional
marzen
consumed
in
october
2004
from
the
toronado
pub
in
san
francisco
ca
poured
a
very
very
dark
black
with
a
small
head
and
had
decent
lacing
smelled
on
super
burnt
coffee
and
deep
dark
malt
tasted
about
the
same
as
it
smelled
tasted
super
dark
a
little
bitter
and
definite
coffee
overtones
didnt
really
catch
a
lot
of
chocolate
as
in
many
stouts
but
it
was
thick
and
chewy
the
bartender
didnt
really
know
how
to
describe
it
he
thought
it
would
be
best
put
under
a
lager
but
after
i
tasted
it
i
cant
see
it
as
anything
other
than
a
stout
a
nice
beer
but
super
dark
and
chewy
a
bit
on
the
dry
side
also
give
it
a
try
the
name
dragged
me
into
it
my
first
beer
from
moonlight
on
tap
at
toronado
sf
i
was
eager
to
try
this
having
had
coffee
and
cigarettes
at
cellarmakers
about
a
mile
or
so
from
toronado
the
look
and
smell
were
good
but
honestly
i
was
not
enjoying
the
taste
a
strong
charred
burnt
taste
that
was
overpowering
the
rest
of
the
beer
maybe
the
fact
i
had
cc
earlier
that
day
distorted
my
rating
i
realize
that
one
is
a
porter
and
the
othe
a
euro
dark
lager
but
i
wound
up
leaving
some
of
this
beer
in
the
glass
which
i
rarely
do
unless
a
beer
is
completely
missing
it
for
me
i
know
othe
bas
like
this
lager
and
maybe
on
another
day
i
would
have
liked
it
more
i
cant
recommend
this
beer
the
batch
i
had
on
tap
had
a
substantial
diacetyl
problem
too
bad
really
felt
like
the
beer
couldve
been
great
will
try
again
4
oz
draft
pour
in
santa
rosa
ca
at
flavor
bistro
typically
dont
care
much
for
black
beers
but
this
one
is
miraculously
almost
paradoxically
light
no
gutbusting
thickness
or
crazy
highabv
undertow
beneath
the
flavor
which
is
impressively
complex
slightly
charred
pleasant
notes
of
coffee
and
chocolate
very
freshtasting
too
which
is
the
upside
of
it
being
brewed
only
a
few
miles
away
wonderfully
balanced
and
presented
with
a
classic
lager
feel
wonderful
brew
on
tap
at
the
toronado
in
san
francisco
and
only
5
dark
black
good
head
aroma
is
dark
malts
nice
flavor
is
dark
malts
with
hints
of
mild
chocolate
and
a
definite
lager
flavor
this
definitely
tastes
like
a
schwartzbier
another
nice
beer
from
moonlight
this
is
by
far
their
most
intensely
flavored
beer
ive
been
able
to
sample
from
them
so
far
but
its
also
the
most
challenging
to
finish
a
full
pint
of
unfortunately
im
astonished
on
how
a
dark
lager
could
ever
taste
this
bready
thick
and
intense
and
yet
still
retain
a
low
gravity
definitely
not
a
bad
offering
during
the
colder
months
however
and
i
always
gladly
revisit
this
whenever
im
in
the
mood
recommended
for
those
wanting
an
adventurous
new
favorite
lager
i
suggest
riding
the
midnight
ghost
like
kerouac
up
to
san
francisco
to
try
this
one
my
children
o
middling
black
lager
apparently
i
am
totally
bucking
the
reviews
i
wish
i
had
another
chance
to
review
this
on
tap
pours
a
very
dark
brown
with
small
tan
head
that
has
good
retention
and
leaves
some
light
lacing
on
the
glass
the
aroma
is
quite
roasty
with
a
bit
of
coffee
and
some
light
dark
chocolate
the
taste
is
dry
and
roasty
with
light
coffee
and
dark
bitter
chocolate
the
finish
is
dry
with
some
roastiness
and
a
light
bitterness
lingering
roastiness
light
body
medium
carbonation
this
is
quite
enjoyable
a
light
bodied
dry
roasty
beer
that
you
can
easily
have
several
of
awesome
this
is
a
stellar
black
lager
incredibly
fresh
the
deep
malt
flavors
yet
still
light
and
extremely
quaffable
seek
this
out
if
youre
in
the
bay
area
o
great
beer
it
seems
fairly
complex
and
its
gets
even
zanier
as
ti
warms
im
actually
really
impressed
damn
id
drink
this
all
day
long
if
i
could
solid
wow
hallelujah
thats
the
first
thing
that
comes
to
mind
after
i
take
a
whiff
of
this
one
and
taste
it
the
complexities
of
this
one
almost
seem
like
a
porter
or
stout
but
its
a
lager
brilliant
amazing
beer
this
is
one
of
my
top
beers
of
the
year
i
appreciate
when
brewers
can
make
beers
outside
of
the
popular
styles
of
the
day
and
really
do
it
well
this
is
one
of
those
beers
a
real
pleasure
to
drink
this
would
garner
my
highest
suggestion
for
a
beer
to
try
do
it
if
ya
get
the
chance
i
could
drink
this
half
liter
for
a
while
great
rendition
of
a
dark
lager
lots
of
flavor
but
still
very
light
i
only
give
a
4
overall
because
this
isnt
my
favorite
style
to
drink
smells
smokey
and
malty
taste
sweet
and
very
flavorful
lots
of
roast
and
malty
goodness
well
carbonated
good
mouth
feel
overall
a
really
good
representation
of
the
style
it
looks
smells
and
feels
like
a
stout
almost
with
an
easysipping
smoothness
in
spite
of
the
roasted
notes
the
flavor
is
smooth
with
roast
and
bittering
to
define
it
as
well
as
a
robust
roast
and
a
dry
finish
its
full
flavored
with
so
much
going
on
and
it
remains
one
of
my
absolute
favorite
brews
brian
hunt
is
an
unsung
marvel
of
brewing
bravo
o
delicious
would
be
excellent
with
a
dark
chocolate
dessert
or
perhaps
a
nice
charred
steak
and
garlic
potatoes
highly
recommended
great
lager
pours
an
opaque
black
with
a
foamy
dark
khaki
head
that
settles
to
a
film
on
top
of
the
beer
foamy
rings
of
lace
form
around
the
glass
on
the
drink
down
smell
is
of
dark
roasted
malt
coffee
and
some
hop
aromas
taste
is
much
the
same
with
a
mild
roasty
and
hop
bitterness
with
each
sip
this
beer
has
a
good
level
of
carbonation
with
a
crisp
mouthfeel
overall
this
is
a
good
beer
that
is
tasty
and
easy
to
drink
had
this
a
couple
times
on
tap
on
a
recent
trip
to
sf
im
always
a
fan
of
the
style
seeking
out
new
at
least
to
me
examples
and
this
is
the
best
ive
had
it
has
the
agreeable
drinkability
of
your
standard
dark
lager
or
schwarzbier
but
the
depth
of
a
great
baltic
porter
there
were
fruity
cherry
tones
at
times
and
then
dry
toffee
and
cocoa
with
an
interesting
cola
edge
im
so
impressed
by
how
many
clean
distinct
and
delicious
dark
malt
flavors
are
crammed
into
this
lager
go
find
this
beer
you
need
it
o
an
awesome
beer
moonlight
makes
some
of
the
most
flavorful
lagers
ive
had
in
a
long
time
this
is
a
really
drinkable
tasty
beer
overall
just
a
bit
too
much
i
love
char
and
roast
and
other
bitter
flavors
but
this
was
a
bit
over
the
top
o
one
of
the
worlds
easiest
drinking
beers
flavors
are
rich
enough
to
be
interesting
but
not
overly
complex
or
strong
loved
it
reminds
me
of
sam
adams
black
lager
with
an
extreme
roast
mashed
grain
flavor
bonus
points
in
the
overall
flavors
of
belgian
dark
chocolate
islay
smoke
coffee
all
nicely
interwoven
a
dry
roasty
finish
that
leaves
a
dose
of
lingering
bitterness
medium
bodied
and
creamy
with
a
fine
blend
of
flavors
easily
sessionable
and
one
of
the
most
intensely
flavorful
lagers
in
recent
memory
paired
nicely
with
pesto
foccacia
and
an
appetizer
of
celery
wrapped
in
parmesan
and
thin
raw
beef
moonlight
makes
some
very
good
beers
and
this
one
is
no
exception
it
has
tons
of
flavor
for
the
abv
and
if
you
get
the
chance
to
try
it
i
highly
suggest
it
never
has
any
brewer
so
successfully
obliterated
style
guidelines
while
it
drinks
like
a
schwarzbier
its
flavour
profile
is
on
a
whole
other
level
on
my
extended
vacation
in
california
i
learned
that
you
can
be
certain
of
more
in
life
than
just
death
and
taxes
you
can
be
sure
that
wherever
theres
moonlight
on
tap
theres
worldclass
beer
to
be
had
o
awesome
very
complex
beer
whenever
i
see
this
on
tap
i
order
it
at
5
this
is
a
beer
you
can
and
should
have
a
few
of
d
very
drinkable
the
flavors
here
are
extremely
well
balanced
and
very
complex
it
seems
to
get
more
and
more
complex
with
each
sip
overall
this
was
a
great
beer
a
very
very
nice
black
lager
bottle
poured
a
dark
color
lager
with
a
large
foamy
head
with
good
retention
and
some
light
lacing
aroma
of
lightly
roasted
malt
notes
with
some
caramel
and
light
black
chocolate
notes
taste
is
also
a
mix
between
some
light
caramel
malt
with
subtle
notes
of
chocolate
and
light
dry
bitter
finish
body
is
about
average
with
good
carbonation
well
doe
for
the
style
with
great
drinkability
and
complexity
ratio
poured
from
tap
into
pint
glass
very
little
head
black
but
holds
a
dark
dark
amber
in
the
light
nose
is
fair
cocoa
a
tad
splash
of
coffee
roasty
malt
towards
to
end
taste
is
sweet
chocolate
much
like
the
nose
forecasts
but
a
good
amount
of
coffee
comes
forth
mouth
feel
is
good
good
carb
for
the
light
nature
of
the
brew
drinkability
is
excellent
goes
down
easy
and
is
not
heavy
on
the
tongue
like
a
guinness
but
more
body
overall
a
great
session
goto
for
a
darker
beer
that
brings
flavor
black
color
light
brown
head
with
good
retention
nose
is
full
of
roasted
malts
and
coffee
taste
is
equally
intense
with
the
roast
and
coffee
but
adds
a
sweet
caramel
and
chocolate
for
a
robust
taste
medium
body
good
moderate
carbonation
super
creamy
for
the
abv
this
has
the
flavor
of
a
robust
porter
but
accomplishes
this
with
a
low
abv
and
lager
yeast
overall
the
taste
is
decent
and
the
the
drinkability
is
very
high
on
this
one
i
think
that
based
on
the
high
ratings
on
this
site
that
i
expected
more
from
it
however
the
appearance
is
boring
and
the
mouthfeel
was
lacking
id
still
drink
it
again
though
simple
and
delicious
nothing
else
o
this
one
did
go
down
easily
thanks
to
the
somewhat
thin
body
and
light
abv
but
the
not
particularly
great
flavor
makes
this
just
an
average
beer
all
around
was
interesting
to
have
a
lightly
smoky
lager
in
contrast
to
the
very
oversmoked
ones
ive
had
in
the
past
d
that
smooth
body
and
lightness
on
the
tongue
make
this
a
very
drinkable
beer
in
fact
i
had
one
more
before
moving
on
had
this
on
tap
during
my
california
trip
last
fall
reviewing
from
my
notes
pours
pitch
black
with
thin
tan
head
nice
lacing
down
the
glass
smells
of
some
roasted
malt
and
more
hops
than
i
expected
i
got
a
hint
of
some
citrus
small
bitterness
in
the
flavour
fairly
well
balanced
a
very
delicious
beer
nice
carbonation
level
drinkable
for
days
as
the
tastes
were
not
too
strong
and
the
brew
went
down
almost
too
easily
highly
recommended
if
you
happen
on
it
have
always
been
a
fan
of
this
beer
and
only
wish
i
had
more
of
a
chance
to
drink
it
one
of
the
best
domestic
lagers
i
can
think
of
and
at
only
5
abv
this
is
the
sort
of
beer
i
could
hang
back
with
and
drink
all
night
great
stuff
d
true
to
style
and
fairly
interesting
this
dark
lager
from
moonlight
is
easy
to
drink
and
less
strong
than
most
ales
that
offer
similar
roasty
qualities
still
it
doesnt
provide
any
unique
appealing
sensory
qualities
over
a
good
american
porter
i
feel
that
i
may
have
done
this
beer
a
slight
disservice
in
drinking
it
alone
since
its
profile
begs
to
be
paired
with
savory
or
spicy
food
d
i
get
this
whenever
i
see
it
on
tap
it
was
listed
as
4
2
alcohol
on
the
menu
and
i
cant
think
of
another
4
2
beer
with
this
much
flavor
or
character
highly
recommended
i
am
glad
i
tried
it
while
down
here
since
this
is
probably
my
only
chance
to
get
a
taste
since
i
have
never
seen
it
in
boise
it
would
be
a
boise
favorite
i
tell
you
if
it
was
distributed
but
as
i
said
one
man
show
how
the
story
was
told
to
me
though
is
the
guy
is
totally
happy
with
that
i
personally
think
that
is
cool
that
he
has
found
his
work
load
and
happy
spot
stay
with
it
is
what
i
say
beer
is
a
little
ashy
medium
to
light
in
body
creamy
mouthfeel
but
the
bitterness
at
the
back
of
the
beer
is
distracting
its
quite
ashy
the
beer
gets
better
the
more
i
drink
and
the
more
i
allow
it
to
warm
but
this
was
a
little
bit
of
a
disappointment
for
me
16
ounces
was
way
way
more
than
enough
honestly
i
dont
think
id
have
it
again
ive
had
other
schwartz
beers
that
were
better
overall
a
tasty
and
complex
dark
lager
same
and
straightforward
in
the
taste
its
has
medium
carbonation
and
is
very
smooth
going
down
nothing
fatiguing
about
this
lager
at
all
extremely
drinkable
and
very
enjoyable
enjoyed
on
tap
at
toronado
i
like
the
style
and
this
was
a
decent
example
of
it
though
not
the
best
i
have
had
served
a
little
cold
lacey
above
average
mouthfeel
with
chocolate
and
a
little
sour
or
rather
coffee
bitter
astringent
good
drinkability
for
some
reason
it
did
not
seem
at
peak
condition
a
soft
black
lager
served
in
a
tall
glass
light
but
not
thin
dark
but
not
overly
roasty
with
a
classic
clean
dry
stoutstyle
finish
that
makes
this
not
only
a
good
drinker
but
an
excellent
accompaniment
to
food
the
longer
i
sipped
it
the
more
i
enjoyed
it
a
beautiful
beer
d
its
nice
to
have
a
good
moonlight
beer
again
after
the
abomination
that
is

quite
a
nice
dark
lager
clear
and
deep
brown
with
coppery
edges
not
much
of
a
cap
on
my
pint
but
that
was
okay
the
bit
of
foam
that
was
present
stuck
like
glue
to
the
glass

left
a
lot
of
lace
behind

and
a
nice
follow

reality
czech
j
a
solidly
made
beer
thoroughly
enjoyable
lots
of
flavor
but
still
restrained
enough
to
appeal
to
a
novice
palate
huge
drinkability
glad
to
know
you
can
find
pitchers
of
this
at
some
of
the
other
eateries
in
the
area
ok
maybe
not
but
oh
dear
lord
dt
is
amazing
moonlight
makes
some
consistently
enjoyable
beers
and
this
is
one
of
my
favorites
early
in
my
beer
drinking
career
i
decided
i
didnt
like
this
style
but
beers
like
this
one
have
cause
me
to
do
a
complete
180
if
youre
ever
in
the
bay
area
one
of
your
top
beery
priorities
should
be
finding
out
where
moonlight
is
on
tap
d
tasty
tasty
beer
goes
down
easily
highly
drinkable
the
abv
on
this
makes
it
ridiculously
drinkable
d
ive
tried
other
schwatzbiers
and
found
them
to
be
like
other
lagers
except
black
this
was
more
like
a
stout
brewed
with
lager
yeast
full
of
flavor
and
complex
one
of
the
best
surprises
and
one
of
the
best
beers
ive
had
in
a
very
long
time
unfortunatelyto
the
best
of
my
knowledge
its
not
available
in
kansas
city
if
youre
ever
in
the
northern
california
area
seek
it
out
you
will
not
be
disappointed
pours
a
shimmering
opaque
black
there
is
a
nice
tan
head
and
a
good
deal
of
lacing
the
nose
is
roasted
malt
chocolate
dry
coffee
and
hints
of
smoke
the
taste
brings
forward
a
lot
of
bitter
dark
chocolate
and
some
coffee
a
bit
of
sweetness
in
the
finish
mouthfeel
is
light
and
dry
quite
drinkableas
much
as
i
was
disappointed
by
reality
czech
i
was
very
pleased
with
this
one
drinkability
this
is
what
a
schwarzbier
wanted
to
be
all
along
lots
of
complexity
with
chocolate
and
roasted
coffee
flavors
along
with
the
grassy
germanic
hop
bill
just
incredible
d
this
is
under
5
this
is
a
schwarzbier
i
could
drink
this
one
all
night
the
best
of
the
moonlight
beers
that
i
tried
on
my
trip
another
quality
standby
from
the
moonlight
camp
the
only
downfall
of
dt
is
that
it
is
only
avail
in
a
tiny
part
of
the
us
fortunately
i
live
there
moonlight
is
a
brewery
of
dreams
and
starlight
may
they
brew
forever
super
light
for
the
extreme
flavor
goes
down
like
crazy
you
see
the
color
you
taste
the
complexity
and
then
you
wonder
why
its
not
9
5
abv
drinkability
how
about
drinkasuckadong
yeah
i
said
it
ill
drink
dt
until
the
day
i
die
d
here
is
where
this
lager
excels
for
a
beer
that
is
blacker
than
black
it
drinks
like
water
light
bodied
and
more
drinkable
and
darker
than
schwarzbiers
native
to
germany
world
class
beer
if
youre
in
the
bay
area
and
get
the
opportunity
to
drink
this
beer
do
so
drinkability
is
ok
i
dont
drink
a
lot
of
schwartzbier
but
like
most
any
other
western
us
version
of
a
classic
euro
style
this
one
seems
amped
up
which
maybe
i
like
but
id
probably
just
assume
have
a
porter
at
that
point
as
i
always
found
a
lot
of
the
charm
of
a
schwartz
to
be
the
light
body
but
the
huge
flavor
and
low
abv
is
still
a
plus
my
first
moonlight
beer
in
spite
of
the
style
i
had
to
order
it
based
on
the
name
and
thats
probably
its
best
feature
one
of
the
better
interprestations
of
this
style
it
wasnt
bad
but
nothing
distinctly
stood
out
aside
from
the
unusual
aroma
carbonation
was
good
filling
and
warm
as
it
hits
the
stomach
something
i
could
easily
drink
for
days
had
this
on
tap
at
ben
n
nicks
in
oakland
ca
a
true
masterpiece
and
for
my
money
the
best
in
its
class
pours
a
an
impenetrable
black
the
way
a
schwarzbier
should
with
a
beautiful
brown
head
that
scatters
aromas
of
dark
chocolate
trouffles
and
expresso
right
and
left
this
is
one
enticing
beer
the
tastes
of
dark
chocolate
and
french
roast
with
the
perfect
level
of
bitterness
come
through
loud
and
clear
its
body
is
on
the
mediumlight
end
of
the
spectrum
and
its
surprisingly
low
abv
make
it
one
of
the
most
of
the
most
drinkable
black
brews
out
there
i
highly
recommend
it
d
very
god
i
loved
this
one
d
not
sure
the
best
way
to
rate
drinkability
for
this
one
definitely
easy
to
drink
but
i
would
expect
so
at
4
2
nevertheless
good
will
likely
get
it
again
the
taste
is
similar
but
with
a
strongly
toasted
malt
emphasis
and
without
the
caramel
it
has
hints
of
chocolate
and
coffee
burnt
toast
with
initial
sweetness
balanced
by
a
zesty
spicy
bitterness
it
has
a
long
mellow
finish
and
is
satisfying
smooth
and
fairly
light
while
having
fairly
full
body
and
flavor
it
is
not
especially
complex
though
and
overtime
starts
to
become
slightly
dulled
d
thinner
and
light
with
an
ok
after
taster
i
guess
that
means
it
is
drinkable
coffee
chocolate
it
reminded
me
of
a
porter
on
cask
rich
foamy
gummy
head
not
too
sweet
low
alcohol
presence
not
much
aroma
d
great
stuff
this
very
good
a
rich
schwarzbier
it
seems
to
dial
back
the
roast
and
coffee
bitterness
and
smooth
it
out
somehow
makes
it
a
very
easy
to
drink
and
enjoy
beer
d
lots
of
flavour
for
a
4
or
so
beer
moonlight
strikes
again
with
another
quality
product
enjoyed
ontap
at
the
hydro
grill
in
calistoga
the
sulphur
flavor
scared
off
my
brother
but
i
really
dug
this
beer
pours
a
complete
black
color
not
thick
but
thin
in
appearance
no
head
and
light
on
the
carbonation
nose
was
spent
matches
and
fireplace
ash
not
overly
strong
but
just
enough
to
be
able
to
piece
it
together
flavor
was
the
aroma
but
all
the
more
so
plus
i
got
some
cocoa
and
coffee
beans
coming
out
but
as
if
they
were
placed
in
the
roaster
and
forgotten
about
for
an
extra
hour
or
so
second
beer
from
moonlight
and
it
was
quite
good
would
love
to
try
the
sour
version
of
this
not
too
familiar
with
this
style
but
better
than
the
ones
i
have
had
in
the
past
tasted
great
with
my
pulled
pork
sandwich
will
definitely
drink
this
again
if
i
see
it
recommended
drinkability
rather
drinkable
i
must
say
the
only
drawback
is
that
it
is
a
bit
intense
its
my
understanding
that
as
a
lowalcohol
lager
this
is
supposed
to
be
an
easydrinking
dark
beer
this
beer
is
many
things
many
of
them
extremely
positive
but
as
i
had
to
stop
after
two
pints
i
wouldnt
say
its
the
most
drinkable
overall
i
have
had
this
beer
before
and
i
liked
it
i
still
like
it
i
tend
to
find
myself
leaning
away
from
lagers
and
drinking
more
sour
beers
and
hop
bombs
this
beer
is
a
good
reminder
that
there
are
many
good
lagers
out
there
on
tap
toronado
black
color
thin
head
of
light
tan
foam
the
aroma
is
mild
with
notes
of
toasty
malt
and
a
brisk
hoppiness
the
taste
is
very
pleasant
lightly
sweet
toasted
malt
with
a
solid
lingering
hop
bitterness
it
is
very
enjoyable
and
the
lingering
bitterness
keeps
you
coming
back
medium
body
with
decent
carbonation
this
is
a
true
session
beer
and
if
i
didnt
have
so
many
other
choices
at
the
toronado
i
would
probably
stick
with
it
this
is
the
best
kept
secret
of
northern
california
beers
while
this
beer
is
almost
black
it
is
very
light
and
refreshing
the
lager
yeast
and
dark
malts
balance
perfectly
to
make
this
the
most
drinkable
dark
beer
i
have
ever
tasted
only
on
draft
it
is
the
most
commonly
found
of
moonlights
beers
on
tap
at
the
flavor
bistro
in
santa
rosa
ca
poured
a
nice
dark
black
but
with
good
clarity
when
viewed
at
its
edges
high
roasted
smell
and
flavor
mediumlight
mouthfeel
the
roastiness
is
front
and
center
but
on
a
little
lighter
body
not
a
creamy
mouthfeel
or
anything
like
guinness
good
beer
to
showcase
a
roasted
malt
character
and
not
be
overtaken
by
alcohol
or
anything
else
mouth
enters
crisp
and
lightly
soured
though
rich
coffee
and
caramel
prunes
and
raisins
give
way
to
a
burnt
toast
bitter
finish
that
allows
a
hop
balance
to
shine
through
a
bit
mouthfeel
is
creamy
yet
it
contains
some
sparkly
carbonation
that
tickles
the
roof
of
my
mouth
swallow
is
creamy
and
bright
this
is
my
favorite
schwarzbier
and
is
quickly
becoming
one
of
my
favorite
beers
period
d
flavors
are
intense
burntsmoky
flavor
is
overbearing
after
a
while
i
liked
the
flavor
in
moderation
but
wanted
something
sweeter
after
this
actually
wanted
some
water
and
a
tongue
scraper
a
very
good
beer
to
try
not
sure
about
making
it
a
session
beer
despite
its
low
abv
still
a
very
tasty
example
pitch
black
like
a
stout
with
no
head
whatsoever
due
to
the
bartenders
pour
not
a
lack
of
carbonation
strong
aromas
of
roasted
barley
and
faint
smoke
like
the
smell
the
taste
is
intensely
roasty
undertones
of
bittersweet
chocolate
and
burnt
toast
are
present
as
well
its
not
an
extremely
complex
brew
but
i
dont
think
its
trying
to
be
its
pretty
lightbodied
and
crisp
despite
the
big
flavor
very
quaffable
stuff
hard
to
believe
this
is
only
4

abv
a
great
brew
all
in
all
and
one
of
the
better
schwarzbiers
ive
had
admittedly
not
many
forget
all
day
i
could
drink
this
all
week
excellent
beeer
for
the
style
and
really
just
an
excellent
beer
all
around
i
remember
drinking
this
beer
while
i
worked
on
my
taxes
on
jupiters
patio
in
berkeley
10
or
15
years
ago
it
was
great
to
have
it
again
and
see
its
still
a
fine
brew
pours
black
with
a
thin
tan
head
and
little
lacing
the
sccent
is
mostly
of
clean
lightly
toasted
grain
no
sourness
from
the
grain
which
you
sometimes
get
with
the
style
the
flavor
is
a
perfectly
balanced
mix
of
hop
bitterness
and
light
toastiness
with
a
crisp
mouthfeel
and
good
medium
body
its
refreshing
tasty
and
clean
not
grainy
in
the
mouth
sour
too
toasty
nor
sweet
beautiful
example
of
a
style
thats
hard
to
find
done
right
in
this
country
the
brew
had
a
medium
body
with
medium
to
high
carbonation
appropriate
for
the
style
i
did
not
want
another
one
after
this
i
would
never
have
guessed
that
moonlight
death
and
taxes
would
be
my
cofavorite
beer
from
georges
mostly
unauthorized
home
bottling
project
ii
especially
given
the
hoppy
nature
of
the
others
its
amazing
beer
though
and
will
probably
never
be
topped
by
another
schawarzbier
in
terms
of
flavor
and
sheer
drinkability
the
grim
reaper
and
the
taxman
can
go
screw
themselves
ill
drink
death
and
taxes
and
think
about
ways
to
cheat
them
both
22
oz
bottle
filled
using
a
counterpressure
technique
you
all
know
the
drill
it
pours
from
the
bottle
a
solid
dark
brown
to
black
color
a
small
finger
of
head
falls
to
a
very
spotty
coat
over
top
the
dark
quality
leaves
me
unsure
about
the
clarity
and
there
is
no
detectable
carbonation
working
up
to
the
surface
the
aroma
is
nice
with
a
solid
chocolate
and
roast
malt
character
with
a
very
solid
pine
backbone
that
really
acts
as
an
arbitrator
between
the
chocolate
and
roast
i
like
it
the
flavor
hits
with
a
strong
roast
to
ashen
character
that
moves
to
the
nice
solid
chocolate
sweetness
finishing
with
a
strong
but
not
offensive
pine
hop
that
has
a
strong
bitterness
associated
with
it
the
finish
leaves
me
with
hints
of
mintyness
but
i
know
this
is
not
a
flavor
from
anything
but
from
the
sum
of
the
parts
it
is
interesting
and
i
like
how
it
comes
across
mouthfeel
is
on
the
lighter
end
of
moderate
with
a
carbonation
that
is
of
the
same
quality
i
am
very
impressed
with
the
magnitude
of
the
flavor
and
aroma
of
this
brew
it
really
hits
hard
and
sticks
with
me
im
not
sure
the
hop
is
right
for
a
traditional
schwarzbier
but
i
like
how
it
plays
with
the
other
flavors
and
the
minty
aftertaste
really
draws
me
back
this
one
is
a
winner
especially
at
4

mouthfeel
is
quite
arid
and
light
in
body
with
a
somewhat
chalky
dryness
to
it
as
well
goes
down
incredibly
easy
and
is
packed
full
of
flavor
an
interesting
brew
that
im
happy
to
have
had
the
chance
to
sample

love
the

in

this
is
certainly
a
fresh
beer
perhaps
a

on
the
illconceived
side
more
than
anything
its
definitely
not

bag
the
only
lowpoint
in
a
box
of
wondrous
treats
thanks
george
drinkability
is
great
very
nice
black
lager
here
kudos
to
brian
for
brewing
this
one
the
best
schwarzbier
i
have
had
a
plenty
tasty
and
easy
to
drink
beer
refreshingly
dry
and
highly
hopped
this
is
a
great
beer
for
those
that
find
most
lagers
a
bit
too
sweet
my
critisims
of
this
beer
are
really
just
minor
tweaks
that
would
make
a
solid
beer
and
excellent
one
d
not
a
stout
nor
a
porter
very
nice
and
original
a
great
dark
lager
in
the
same
league
with
sprechers
black
bavarian
anyway
this
was
a
real
treat
and
proved
to
be
another
signature
beer
from
the
everingenious
moonlight
brewing
these
guys
never
cease
to
amaze
and
i
felt
honored
to
partake
of
this
fine
schwarzbier
at
the
flavor
bistro
with
my
wonderful
wife
and
a
great
ba
rapapoda
this
is
a
nice
drinkable
beer
it
seems
like
a
porter
that
was
made
with
lager
yeast
on
tap
at
the
toronado
poured
a
deep
brown
almost
black
color
with
a
fluffy
white
head
with
good
lacing
the
aroma
is
led
by
some
bold
roasted
malts
coffees
and
a
bit
of
hops
in
the
background
the
taste
is
what
you
smell
big
toasty
malts
with
a
bit
of
hop
bitterness
blended
well
this
beer
is
enjoyable
and
leaves
your
mouth
wanting
more
this
is
my
first
moonlight
beer
and
i
really
enjoyed
it
wish
i
could
get
some
of
their
beers
back
in
the
east
drinkability
i
really
enjoyed
this
beer
and
i
highly
recommend
it
someone
at
the
table
next
to
me
proclaimed
hell
yes
theyve
got
death
and
taxes
on
tap
when
he
looked
at
the
menu
i
think
that
says
it
all
drinkability
im
digging
it
i
really
like
the
light
sweetness
level
very
drinkable
will
visit
again
in
the
future
comments
its
hard
to
imagine
how
good
this
beer
is
without
trying
it
yourself
one
of
the
strongest
flavored
beers
i
have
had
to
date
overall
lovely
session
brew
with
a
little
smokiness
to
change
things
up
this
was
on
tap
at
the
toranado
very
dark
brown
to
black
thin
head
that
left
a
beautiful
lace
on
the
side
of
the
glass
aroma
has
roast
malt
mild
chocolate
heavy
espresso
the
taste
has
the
espresso
up
front
followed
by
the
mil
chocolate
definite
hop
bite
in
the
flavor
just
brightens
the
taste
a
bit
slick
full
mouth
feel
with
just
a
touch
of
alcohol
heat
decent
drinakbility
drinkability
went
down
pretty
smooth
i
wish
a
local
bar
had
this
as
i
would
order
it
often
as
it
an
easy
drinker
drinkability
and
notes

great
drinkability
has
all
of
the
wonderful
flavors
of
a
great
american
stout
without
the
filling
ultraheavy
body
i
will
rate
this
beer
ignoring
that
it
is
a
schwarzbier
because
while
this
is
really
not
really
to
style
i
like
it
more
than
any
schwarzbier
that
i
have
ever
had
i
must
admit
i
didnt
like
this
beer
as
much
as
i
wanted
to
black
as
any
stout
on
the
market
a
thin
tan
head
topped
it
and
lacing
was
minimal
slight
roasted
aroma
was
followed
by
a
very
roasted
taste
profile
with
moderate
bitterness
a
very
sticky
aftertaste
was
a
bit
unappealing
for
me
very
spritzy
mouthfeel
and
i
opted
for
another
beer
when
i
had
a
second
pint
possibly
this
one
could
grow
on
me
but
inital
meeting
was
take
it
or
leave
it
814
ontap
le
toronado
strong
coffee
coloured
with
a
nice
tan
head
of
foam
that
lasts
and
leaves
excellent
lacing
as
well
the
aromas
are
crazy
for
a
lager
coffee
chocolate
big
german
malts
and
nice
spicy
hops
in
the
background
as
well
the
taste
was
magnificent
malty
as
all
hell
with
a
great
roastiness
up
front
totally
lagerlike
and
german
up
front
but
it
really
gets
alelike
in
complexity
and
almost
porterstout
like
in
the
middle
palate
and
finish
mouthfeel
is
medium
bodied
and
the
carbonation
levels
are
plush
drinkability
is
insane
its
like
crack
great
stuff
a
almost
always
end
up
having
one
of
these
at
toronado
nice
bubbly
head
lasting
on
an
intense
dark
color
body
the
smell
shows
a
strong
coffee
character
dry
coffee
beans
on
one
side
and
coffee
and
cream
or
ice
cream
on
the
other
the
taste
is
definitely
coffee
notes
of
toffee
and
praline
quite
sparkling
biscuity
in
the
mouthfeel
with
some
refreshing
notes
of
lemon
and
a
hint
of
grassy
hoppiness
that
dries
the
mouth
a
little
bit
mouthfeel
is
light
and
fesh
roasted
and
almost
smoked
wooden
and
creamy
quite
drinkable
the
taste
is
just
as
you
would
smell
it
its
loaded
with
coffee
and
licorce
flavors
slightly
chocolate
for
all
of
this
its
still
a
pretty
light
beer
its
feel
is
full
bodied
but
still
light
enough
to
be
described
as
feeling
like
a
lighter
lager
its
very
refreshing
and
very
easy
to
drink
theres
no
bitterness
that
is
often
associated
with
dark
beers
this
would
be
a
great
beer
for
those
who
have
never
really
drank
darker
styles
but
would
like
to
its
very
easy
to
drink
lots
of
it
tap
toronado
san

a
pretty
unique
dark
lager
mashyoaty
quite
ashy
and
salty
pretty
big
hit
of
hops
and
bitterness
pretty
tasty
but
a
little
unbalanced
quite
smooth
and
grainy
to
pretty
interesting
stuff
didnt
think
it
was
a
dunkel
when
i
was
trying
it
though
this
was
one
of
my
favorite
beers
when
playing
pool
with
my
buds
it
is
only
available
on
tap
in
the
sf
bay
area
but
if
you
see
it
go
for
it
if
you
like
porters
and
stouts
try
this
it
is
similar
but
a
little
different
dark
black
color
with
a
dark
purple
tint
that
rather
pretty
medium

aroma
is
roasted

and
coffee
a
medium
bodied
schwarthbeir
malts
are
roasted
coffee
and

clean
and
smooth
aftertaste
is
slightly
bitter
paddys
irish
red
pours
a
slightly
hazy
orange
amber
with
a
thin
bubbly
head
the
aroma
is
malty
with
hints
of
caramel
and
nome
nice
herbal
hops
the
flavor
is
really
nice
a
well
balanced
blend
of
mildly
sweet
malt
and
a
nice
firm
but
not
overpower
hop
character
there
is
a
nice
toffee
undertone
with
a
hint
of
nutty
chocolate
o
based
on
the
style
it
actually
is
quite
fitting
offering
up
tealike
hop
notes
and
a
super
dry
finish
that
being
said
the
metallic
notes
were
a
bit
of
a
turnoff
and
the
mouthfeel
made
for
a
less
than
pleasurable
experience
drinkability
its
a
very
smooth
drinkable
beer
accompanied
with
bland
flavors
and
aromas
its
drinkable
but
a
very
underwhelming
example
of
the
style
and
i
cant
envision
myself
ever
recommending
this
to
someone
or
buying
it
again
if
you
must
drink
one
of
trafalgars
iras
their
elora
irish
ale
is
closer
to
the
style
and
at
least
marginally
better
honestly
though
i
like
smithwicks
more
than
either
of
them
and
that
should
tell
you
all
you
need
to
know
trafalgars
slogan
is
we
only
sell
what
we
cant
drink
ourselves
theres
a
reason
you
can
find
so
much
of
their
brands
on
the
shelves
here
in
ontario
obviously
even
they
dont
want
to
drink
the
stuff
themselves
certainly
no
one
else
will
want
to
take
it
while
paddys
may
be
one
of
their
more
agreeable
offerings
in
that
its
not
infected
and
reasonably
drinkable
its
still
strives
to
be
nothing
more
than
an
average
beer
too
dirty
smelling
and
tasting
to
have
more
than
one
or
two
ever
unless
it
was
all
that
i
had
can
poured
a
clear
medium
amber
color
ale
with
a
medium
foamy
head
with
good
retention
and
some
lacing
aroma
of
dry
unrefined
grain
is
somewhat
bland
taste
is
also
dominated
by
dry
unrefined
cereal
taste
with
no
discernible
hops
and
not
that
great
of
a
drinkability
factor
very
bland
average
for
style
and
though
there
is
no
brewing
flaws
there
is
nothing
too
spectacular
to
speak
of
d
drinks
reasonably
easy
i
suppose
if
you
dont
mind
the
bitterness
scored
from
north
of
the
border
lets
give
it
a
whirl
nice
foamup
on
popping
the
tall
boy
poured
into
a
pint
american
16oz
glass
it
is
red
but
also
gold
nice
foamy
head
smells
kind
of
adjunct
taste
is
very
different
balanced
but
from
both
ends
very
sweet
malts
then
offset
with
peppery
sharply
bitter
but
not
overly
so
hoppiness
nice
mouthfeel
carbonation
is
there
but
not
over
evident
in
the
aftertaste
the
bitterness
continues
and
fades
to
a
dry
finish
good
head
holds
up
throughout
the
pint
a
good
pint
overall
the
noble
hops
add
a
nice
touch
final
thoughts
after
having
this
beer
my
thoughts
suddenly
turn
to
the
simpsons
and
that
episode
where
homer
has
red
tick
beer
not
sure
why
but
i
think
the
red
dog
on
the
can
might
have
done
it
anyways
i
will
give
this
to
trafalgar
they
are
consistent
when
i
need
to
tell
someone
a
brewery
to
stay
away
from
they
are
at
the
top
of
my
list
i
know
they
sell
mead
in
addition
to
beer
and
maybe
its
a
bit
better
however
this
offering
was
disappointing
which
sadly
seems
par
for
the
course
for
this
brewery
i
cant
also
help
but
ask
why
brew
this
their
elora
irish
red
is
quite
a
bit
better
then
this
so
why
brew
this
stuff
overall
a
watery
bland
and
lackluster
irish
red
im
not
a
huge
fan
of
the
style
but
there
just
is
some
flavor
that
is
missing
here
the
flavors
are
not
bad
just
not
alway
there
just
lackluster
all
around
aside
from
the
disastrous
nose
this
brew
wasnt
too
bad
ill
probably
not
get
it
again
though
knowing
how
many
other
reds
there
are
available
to
me
but
its
drinkable
the
appearance
of
this
beer
is
a
stunning
dichotomy
it
pours
a
nice
rich
head
that
is
lacing
heavily
yet
it
is
much
too
light
a
beer
to
be
described
as
red
having
had
numerous
pale
ales
redder
than
this
the
nose
is
lightly
hopped
and
malty
sweet
and
enjoyable
but
the
body
does
not
meet
these
very
characteristics
it
is
a
little
bit
bready
and
thin
with
a
hint
of
bitterness
isnt
strong
in
the
mouth
but
is
an
easy
drinking
beer
with
a
little
bit
of
character
too
bad
this
beer
doesnt
hold
up
to
team
canadas
play
20
after
two
periods
but
no
extra
points
for
this
underwhelming
canadian
suds
offering
i
had
expected
much
worse
im
not
sure
if
i
could
call
this
a
red
ale
but
its
moderately
tasty
and
pretty
drinkable
wont
be
buying
it
again
but
wouldnt
turn
one
down
this
could
be
a
good
gateway
beer
for
people
who
drink
macro
stuff
its
a
step
up
but
nothing
that
would
scare
someone
away
mouthfeel
is
light
to
medium
bodied
with
medium
carbonation
easy
to
drink
and
theres
nothing
really
wrong
with
it
besides
being
totally
plain
reminds
me
of
rickards
red
taste
is
unbalanced
too
much
sweetness
for
me
also
has
a
weird
fruity
tang
not
worth
buying
again
i
thought
i
just
got
a
bad
bottle
but
it
doesnt
seem
anyone
elses
opinion
of
this
brew
is
much
different
from
my
own
unforunate
really
d
not
overly
tasty
mild
sessionable
drink
light
and
refreshing
if
you
like
that
sorta
thing
notes
is
this
really
a
red
seriously
i
think
trafalgar
can
do
better
much
better
this
was
another
lackluster
beer
from
this
brewery
i
get
the
impression
that
they
are
an
all
extract
brewery
and
that
they
have
an
irrational
fear
of
hops
i
agree
with
everyone
else
stay
away
another
red
beer
that
isnt
red
and
isnt
worth
buying
again
the
colour
is
sort
of
an
orangered
dark
tea
colour
no
head
whatsoever
no
lacing
whatsoever
smells
of
caramel
malts
and
used
teabags
taste
is
a
bit
sickly
sweet
with
a
bit
of
a
nutty
character
mouthfeel
is
light
and
dry
rather
bland
would
not
drink
it
again
am
rather
upset
im
left
with
five
more
bottles
d
a
little
more
flavour
than
richards
red
but
it
should
still
be
easily
approachable
to
the
average
consumer
it
is
a
little
heavier
sweet
though
a
650
ml
bomber
was
enough
for
me
it
wasnt
a
nice
experience
harsh
could
not
take
more
than
a
sip
some
malt
a
tad
roasted
and
oily
nothing
else
to
balance
they
could
lose
this
one
bottled
version
was
better
carbonation
from
ontap
adds
some
temporary
fizz
but
otherwise
no
head
so
see
red
colour
like
a
herbal
tea
mild
slightly
sweet
malt
was
all
i
got
out
of
drinking
this
one
a
hint
of
hops
if
you
let
it
warm
up
long
enough
no
dimension
to
this
beer
this
beer
poured
a
nice
dark
red
color
which
was
good
not
much
head
it
also
lacked
some
excitment
in
the
smell
this
lead
to
a
kind
of
bland
taste
having
spent
some
time
in
ireland
i
have
grown
to
love
the
irish
beers
especially
the
ales
i
must
say
that
this
was
a
good
attempt
but
it
lacked
some
authenticity
i
will
drink
it
again
though
pale
copper
quarterinch
pale
beige
head
is
gone
as
soon
as
it
arrives
no
lace
aroma
is
faint
giving
notes
of
toast
and
diacetyl
insipidly
malty
with
a
gentle
bready
note
followed
by
buttery
and
metallic
notes
mildly
bitter
finish
lightbodied
with
somewhat
low
carbonation
thin
but
slightly
slick
mouthfeel
swill
pretty
alright
brew
definetly
enjoyed
it
lots
of
off
notes
here
ill
probably
avoid
it
anytime
ill
be
in
the
mood
for
a
lager
amber
or
any
other
kind
overall
not
overly
impressed
but
does
a
great
job
of
quenching
thirst
and
is
about
as
inoffensive
as
can
be
overall
another
rubbish
beer
from
faxe
i
notice
its
classed
here
as
a
dark
rather
than
an
amber
but
in
either
category
i
would
reach
for
others
first
final
grade
3
15
a
c
overall
i
was
pleasantly
surprised
by
this
beer
thats
not
saying
its
anything
spectacular
but
its
not
offensive
and
is
quite
drinkable
it
actually
reminded
me
a
bit
of
a
toned
down
english
ipa
it
would
work
well
as
a
session
beer
pours
a
dark
copper
color
with
moderate
carbonation
and
a
frothy
lace
of
head
smell
is
on
the
light
side
but
acceptable
and
its
hard
to
pinpoint
and
specific
aromas
goes
down
really
smooth
taste
is
typical
dark
lager
which
is
pretty
darn
good
and
slight
sensation
or
bittterness
carbonation
feels
very
minimal
but
no
complaints
overall
very
drinkable
beer
and
would
pick
up
another
but
have
not
seen
this
in
the
states
overall
quite
drinkable
but
not
remarkable
no
glaring
problems
but
a
little
boring
this
beer
is
okay
different
take
on
amber
beers
but
feels
in
inconsistent
not
bad
for
the
price
try
it
out
if
you
like
sugary
apple
tastes
d
decent
beer
and
fairly
inexpensive
where
i
live
drinkability
i
found
this
beer
became
more
pleasurable
as
i
drank
more
and
more
sips
was
a
decent
tasting
beer
and
the
taste
became
very
pleasant
after
the
first
few
mouthfuls
i
would
recommend
this
beer
to
anyone
looking
for
a
nice
looking
beer
with
a
decent
taste
d
fairly
easy
to
go
down
and
pretty
cheap
i
just
didnt
like
how
it
sat
in
my
stomach
faxe
amber
exceeded
my
expectations
which
by
admission
were
quite
low
given
that
ive
found
all
of
this
brewerys
other
offerings
rather
disagreeable
despite
that
it
failed
at
being
all
that
desirable
it
isnt
something
i
see
myself
drinking
again
but
its
not
anything
i
mind
finishing
now
that
ive
already
started
drinking
it
this
time
this
will
probably
be
my
last
faxe
brew
pretty
disappointed
with
both
offerings
although
this
one
was
admittedly
more
drinkable
dont
avoid
this
its
actually
pretty
good
for
canned
beer
and
if
you
are
in
canada
at
2
a
can
its
also
a
pretty
good
price
another
faxe
brew
this
was
my
second
venture
into
the
world
of
faxe
and
it
will
be
my
last
after
having
their
extra
strong
lager
i
thought
this
would
be
interesting
but
i
was
sorrily
mistaken
poured
out
of
the
500ml
can
into
a
pint
glass
it
looks
real
nice
nice
copper
color
with
a
nice
2
inch
fluffy
off
white
head
i
had
high
hopes
at
this
point
i
took
a
nice
big
whiff
of
the
smell
of
the
beer
and
man
did
it
smell
bad
skunky
metallic
even
when
poured
out
of
the
can
wet
hay
smell
brutal
after
the
first
sip
i
was
so
repulsed
by
this
that
i
almost
poured
it
out
it
has
a
watered
down
malty
taste
with
little
hops
with
a
metallic
twang
just
like
the
extra
strong
lager
i
think
thats
the
trademark
taste
for
this
brewery
just
bad
thin
and
watery
mouthfeel
very
light
this
is
insanely
hard
to
drink
even
when
cold
i
was
barely
able
to
choke
down
the
whole
thing
avoid
drinkability
isnt
bad
id
drink
this
again
and
it
makes
a
great
party
beer
not
as
bad
as
some
might
lead
on
but
this
definately
isnt
cream
of
the
crop
or
top
shelf
quality
consider
this
as
you
would
any
readily
available
domestic
beer
better
than
corona
vikings
are
awesome
they
plunder
and
pillage
to
their
hearts
content
the
one
on
this
can
seems
happy
although
i
think
if
he
tried
this
beer
hed
be
crying
on
the
inside
this
one
poured
a
clear
light
brown
with
lots
of
carbonation
a
fairly
thick
head
that
dissipated
moderately
slow
to
a
good
lacing
then
nothing
there
was
almost
no
scent
i
only
detected
a
tiny
bit
of
malt
faintly
hoppy
and
malty
definitely
watery
with
no
strong
taste
the
feel
of
this
one
is
clean
but
thin
and
watery
for
the
lands
that
brought
us
vikings
this
one
isnt
good
you
would
think
it
would
be
but
it
is
not
at
least
the
can
is
cool
why
oh
why
did
i
try
this
one
oh
ya
because
it
was
danish
their
was
a
viking
on
the
can
and
the
can
was
comiceley
huge
now
that
we
have
dicused
the
good
parts
the
color
was
week
for
an
amber
the
taste
was
bland
untill
the
discusting
after
taste
and
after
a
pint
glass
i
still
had
to
suffer
at
least
23rds
of
the
can
well
i
fell
victom
to
the
navelty
can
if
you
are
smart
you
will
get
as
far
away
from
this
one
as
you
can
i
mean
it
this
one
sucked
the
will
to
live
out
of
me
i
know
the
review
seems
a
bit
high
for
a
notgood
beer
but
its
not
bad
for
what
it
is
d
i
could
drink
all
of
it
i
am
choosing
not
to
not
bad
amusing
for
the
comically
large
can
if
nothing
else
pours
nicely
actually
with
a
pillowy
creme
head
and
a
clear
amber
color
flavor
is
bitter
and
eck
with
a
metallic
tone
and
nothing
positive
going
on
for
it
feel
is
decent
but
who
cares
this
is
a
pretty
lame
beer
thankfully
it
has
the
novelty
of
coming
in
a
massive
can
so
at
least
people
will
but
it
maybe
the
best
oktoberfest
in
a
can
seriously
this
tastes
just
like
an
ok
fest
nice
dark
tan
colour
with
decent
head
and
a
caramel
nose
more
malt
than
hops
the
flavours
are
full
and
slightly
sweet
with
a
solid
finish
considering
the
2
a
tall
can
this
is
a
solid
beer
in
a
style
not
often
seen
in
a
can
purchased
the
can
more
as
a
novelty
because
of
its
size
it
was
the
only
cold
beer
i
had
in
the
house
last
night
settling
into
an
snl
rerun
looking
forward
to
anything
and
i
had
to
pour
this
down
the
sink
after
my
second
taste
maybe
i
thought
the
first
taste
was
just
me
and
maybe
it
was
if
you
like
terrible
beer
with
a
hint
of
turpintine
this
may
be
the
beer
for
you
otherwise
avoid
at
all
costs
a
decent
beer
nothing
spectacular
and
certainly
nothing
id
try
again
my
favorite
part
of
the
beer
is
that
ingredients
are
listed
on
the
can
water
barley
malt
hops
and
maize
drinkability
ive
never
had
a
beer
that
was
a
constant
temperature
the
whole
time
and
the
smell
and
taste
change
every
10
seconds
i
had
no
idea
that
one
could
do
that
but
faxe
somehow
did
my
mind
is
not
going
to
be
like
this
beer
its
made
up
about
having
another
faxe
product
never
again
after
all
the
changing
im
surprized
the
beers
color
didnt
change
at
the
end
poured
from
the
can
light
amber
with
an
off
white
head
which
hung
around
for
just
a
bit
hard
to
smell
much
of
anything
in
this
beer
but
there
were
some
nondescript
malt
and
hop
aromas
taste
was
understated
as
well
a
bit
of
bread
malt
and
mild
hop
bitterness
almost
convinced
me
that
this
was
beer
but
not
quite
pretty
bland
for
sure
certainly
nothing
objectionable
or
difficult
to
swallow
about
this
beer
just
not
that
much
in
its
favor
either
i
tried
this
beer
on
july
25
2007
after
purchasing
from
my
local
lcbo
store
it
poured
a
beautiful
translucent
copperyred
colour
into
the
glass
with
a
generous
head
that
left
absolutely
no
lacing
the
aroma
is
that
of
burnt
malt
the
mouthfeel
is
slimy
with
some
mild
carbonation
the
taste
is
malty
with
a
strong
bitterness
towards
the
end
overall
alot
of
these
brews
from
denmark
seem
rushed
to
many
extracts
if
you
ask
me
worth
a
try
d
should
appeal
to
the
masses
faxe
amber
pours
a
crystal
clear
deep
amber
body
beneath
a
short
head
of
offwhite
the
head
retention
is
fair
and
the
lacing
is
limited
the
nose
offers
a
light
bit
of
grainy
malt
and
some
very
mild
grassy
hops
its
crisp
across
the
palate
with
a
mediumlight
body
and
gently
effervescent
finebubbled
carbonation
the
suggestion
of
caramel
malts
appears
in
the
flavor
but
theyre
not
distinct
some
hops
do
appear
however
herbal
and
spicy
against
the
delicately
grainy
malt
a
bold
bitterness
backs
it
and
it
finishes
dry
and
refreshing
overall
very
basic
but
well
made
500ml
can
poured
a
clear
and
light
amber
color
beer
with
a
big
white
foamy
head
with
good
retention
aroma
of
nutty
malt
is
the
only
noticeable
thing
taste
of
lightly
sweet
nutty
malt
with
a
clear
finish
which
very
little
or
no
hops
included
in
this
beer
overall
this
is
a
bland
and
boring
but
refreshing
vienna
at
one
liter
this
was
hands
down
the
biggest
beer
can
ive
every
had
the
brew
pours
a
light
and
clear
amber
with
a
soapy
head
the
aroma
is
primarily
caramel
and
malt
with
very
little
hop
presence
the
taste
is
a
little
hollow
with
a
touch
of
sweetness
in
the
foretaste
theres
a
little
caramel
and
toastiness
but
their
qualities
are
restrained
to
the
point
of
disinterest
its
a
light
and
almost
watery
brew
with
very
little
to
make
you
pay
attention
the
finish
has
just
enough
hops
to
provide
a
little
balance
and
the
brew
could
stand
to
have
a
lot
more
bitterness
fairly
low
carbonation
makes
this
one
very
easy
to
quaff
its
just
not
very
flavorful
not
offensive
but
certainly
not
exciting
a
fairly
drinkable
brew
albeit
lackluster
and
uneventful

to
an

color
with
a
smaller
head
of
white
foam
that
dissipated
after
the
first
few
sips
medium
low
carbonation
aromas
of
caramel
malts
and

taste
is
medium

mild

some

somewhat
dry
on

this
could
quench
a
thirst
if
one
was
so
inclined
mouthfeel
was
otherwise
uneventful
with
little
carbonation
making
its
way
to
the
palate
drinkability
is
average
worth
trying
i
bet
this
is
better
on
tap
probably
the
least
objectionable
of
the
faxe
dextrose
extract
lagers
but
this
type
of
high
gravity
extractbrewed
beer
always
tastes
lifeless
stale
and
too
sweet
to
me
this
is
the
type
of
crap
steelback
makes
on
this
side
of
the
ocean
i
see
no
need
to
import
more
from
denmark

copper

strong
carbonation

sweet

with
a
hit
of

sweet
flavors
caramel
and
toffee
with
a
bit
of
peppery
hop
on
the
finish
surgary
sweet
without
any
interesting
malt
character
to
back
things
up
a
poor
effort
and
barely
drinkable
well
the
head
was
wispy
despite
being
given
plenty
of
room
to
grow
in
my
wiezen
glass
i
thought
the
taste
was
pretty
bland
and
while
it
may
go
down
well
on
a
hot
afternoon
it
certainly
isnt
anything
special
this
stuff
really
isnt
all
that
bad
difficult
to
drink
difficult
to
enjoy
forget
about
it
might
be
tolerable
if
its
found
on
tap
this
is
a
little
better
than
their
premium
lager
it
has
less
flavor
but
also
less
dms
still
their
are
much
more
interesting
euro
lagers
available
pours
an
orangish
pink
under
a
slightly
offwhite
one
finger
head
that
actually
manages
to
linger
fairly
well
and
maintains
a
large
collar
and
a
few
strands
of
lace
the
nose
is
strong
and
sweet
mainly
of
plum
or
grape
the
mouth
is
very
light
and
quite
prickly
the
taste
is
a
real
let
down
as
there
isnt
much
here
at
first
as
it
warms
it
becomes
harsher
with
metallic
hops
coming
on
strong
the
appearance
and
nose
are
misleading
as
the
brew
is
ultimately
quite
unsatisfying
colour

clear
copperamber
head
pours
out
about
a
14
inch
thick
and
disipated
to
nothing
but
a
thin

weak
smell
mainly
of
malts
grass
herbs
and
grain
husks
though
what
i
do
smell
is
nice
it
needs
more
strength
tastes
like
a
decent
beer
that
has
been
watered
down
definite
bready
malts
grains
grassy
and
herbal
flavours
with
some

bitterness
but
its
too

i

its
alright
not

subpar
okay

out
a
light

nice
white

right
after
the

then
settled
down
to
a
thin
cap

the

not
alot
of

some

of
grass

and
tiny
bit
of
hops
flavour
has
some
sweetness
in
the
middle
and
a
very
mild
hoppy
finish
taste
is
ok
but
if
if
you
are
expecting
a
full
flavor
it
will
seem
a
touch
watered
down
not
alot
of
carbonation
giving
a
smooth
mouthfeel
rather
than
a
crisp
tingle
an
average
amber
ale
drinkable
but
nothing
special
for
the
higher
import
price
i
will
probably
pass
next
time
sad
well
who
would
have
thought
i
found
a
drinkable
product
from
the
faxe
brewery
here
came
in

over
to

and
ends
on
a
mild
hoppy
note
with
a
faint
astringent
aftertaste
faintly
herbal
mouthfeel
lacks
carbonation
but
gets
fuller
as
it
passes
along
the
palate
although
even
then
the
body
is
light
for
a
faxe
beer
this
is
actually
drinkable
im
impressed
that
i
dont
have
to
pour
the
rest
of
it
out
but
in
comparison
to
everything
else
sitting
around
it
on
the
shelf
of
your
beer
haunt
of
choicenecessity
its
pretty
much
a
pass

very
onedimensional

at
best
thx
did
i
mention
this
was
boring
drinkability
a
below
average

extremely
light
in
all
aspects
i
would
pretty
much
never
buy
this
brew
again
good
but
still
no
the
perfect
one
for
me
poured
from
a
12
oz
bottle
into
a
pint
glass
this
is
a
much
better
beer
than
their
green
meenie
it
is
very
flavorful
and
is
lightly
carbonated
not
often
seen
in
the
states
but
worth
a
try
deep

with
an
amber

this

rate

b
v
with
a

i
enjoyed
this
more
than
their
flagship
product
which
ive
only
ever
had
the
green
bottled
version
of
at
the
time
of
this
review
pours
a
deep
mahogany
in
color
with
some
ruby
highlights
about
a
good
12
finger
of
foamy
beige
head
is
seen
when
first
poured
settles
down
a
a
few
mms
during
the
drink
spotty
lacing
is
seen
that
sticks
to
the
sides
of
the
glass
the
aroma
is
mostly
of
sweet
dark
roasted
malts
with
a
hint
of
dark
fruits
pretty
much
the
same
for
the
taste
with
a
hint
of
dark
bread
also
very
smooth
and
goes
down
easy
forgot
how
good
this
one
is
i
like
this
much
better
that
the
regular
heini
that
comes
in
the
green
bottle
mediumbodied
with
medium
carbonation
overall
a
great
brew
great
beer
better
then
the
normal
heineken
o
this
one
surprised
me
its
very
easy
to
drink
and
quite
flavorful
worth
a
shot
if
youre
into
dark
lagers
or
dark
beers
in
general
overall
not
bad
considering
flavor
chocolate
medium
roasted
barley
caramel

with
some
grassy

in
the
finish
overall
a
very
pleasant
dark
lager
nicely
done
alleluia
just
got
this
at
the
distributor
havent
had
heineken
dark
since
the
90s
good
deep
brown
and
a
fine
head
even
a
little
lacing
it
has
a
faint
sweet
roasted
smell
nothing
grand
malt
is
the
star
of
the
show
here
and
some
toasty
caramel
as
the
brew
warms
a
little
great
feel
it
is
just
as
good
an
easy
drinking
brew
as
i
remembered
it
to
be
if
you
want
an
extra
delicious
dark
style
go
doppelbock
this
is
just
meant
to
be
a
straightforward
sessionable
brew
and
if
you
want
the
regular
heineken
lager
from
the
store
to
taste
less
skunky
go
with
the
can
for
a
fresher
taste
i
have
no
problems
with
heineken
but
the
dark
especially
makes
me
smile
heineken
dark
is
by
far
my
favorite
dark
lager
beerand
i
myself
have
never
tasted
another
dark
lager
that
even
comes
close
to
its
perfect
balance
of
flavors
and
tasteit
simply
is
an
utterly
delishious
and
perfectly
rounded
beercheers
overall
this
taste
like
a
poorly
brewed
thin
stout
not
sure
of
what
the
brewers
are
trying
to
do
with
this
one
this
is
not
a
good
beer
at
all
dont
ask
why
i
tasted
this
just
thank
me
for
taking
the
bullet
instead
of
you
i
am
a
huge
fan
of
heineken
and
even
heineken
light
nothing
is
better
for
a
day
full
of
outdoor
activities
needless
to
say
heineken
went
too
far
when
producing
this
euro
dark
lager
it
lacks
a
clear
difference
in
flavor
profile
from
its
counterpart
and
doesnt
feel
complete
it
might
be
worth
trying
as
reviews
are
mixed
but
i
wouldnt
recommend
buying
a
full
case
on
a
whim
o
pleasantly
surprised
given
the
tepid
ratings
for
this
beer
ill
definitely
drink
this
in
the
future
call
me
old
fashion
but
i
primarily
rate
my
beers
based
upon
taste
im
also
a
big
heineken
fan
however
this
brew
still
disappointed
me
it
lacked
a
clean
after
taste
and
the
flavor
that
it
did
have
did
not
satisfy
personally
i
would
not
recommend
this
brew
however
that
is
just
me
i
found
it
truly
disappointing
i
find
this
beer
to
be
very
sessionable
and
delicious
this
is
indeed
a
beverage
that
i
will
seek
out
in
the
future
i
would
consider
this
an
underrated
beer
for
sure
i
never
heard
of
it
until
i
was
at
a
friends
place
and
was
handed
a
bottle
of
it
and
was
very
thankful
once
i
started
drinking
it
it
is
definitely
a
little
bit
darker
than
a
normal
lager
but
that
makes
it
enjoyable
to
me
since
most
porters
are
too
dark
but
sometimes
i
like
to
have
darker
beers
than
a
traditional
lager
if
you
have
not
tried
this
beer
i
would
definitely
recommend
it
this
beer
makes
me
feel
like
i
am
drinking
a
less
filling
porter
i
love
the
flavor
and
smell
its
smooth
with
a
great
semicoffee
aftertaste
im
definitely
a
brownamber
lager
kind
of
guy
so
this
beer
fit
right
into
my
preference
i
think
this
beer
will
be
my
staple
for
a
while
o
kind
of
tastes
like
cheap
gas
station
coffee
not
too
bad
but
not
too
good
either
its
alright
i
could
drink
lots
of
these
so
id
recommend
it
nothing
amazing
just
another
beer
overall
this
wasnt
too
bad
but
it
isnt
anything
to
get
excited
over
im
surprised
i
chose
this
beer
as
ive
had
poor
results
with
dark
lagers
i
first
tried
this
beer
with
a
friend
and
was
a
little
unconvinced
that
heineken
could
pull
this
off
well
i
was
wrong
they
nailed
it
for
me
if
a
dark
somewhat
light
lager
is
what
you
prefer
with
hints
of
chocolate
caramel
cream
and
roasted
malt
you
have
to
try
this
stand
out
beer
from
heineken
top
5
of
mine
for
sure
another
beer
that
i
used
to
drink
decades
ago
but
havent
touched
in
years
i
recall
back
then
that
this
beer
was
a
delicious
find
and
i
think
this
holds
true
today
perhaps
a
little
fizzy
on
the
mouthfeel
side
of
things
but
its
warm
welcoming
dark
flavors
are
the
highlight
the
pour
erased
any
question
that
it
might
not
be
dark
i
had
twoplus
fingers
of
rocky
deeptan
head
by
the
time
that
i
was
done
and
it
looked
like
the
top
of
a
root
beer
float
color
was
rubyred
with
nequality
clarity
and
i
began
to
think
of
the
last
time
i
had
seen
a
beer
this
pretty
nose
was
rich
with
caramel
toffee
even
coconut
mouthfeel
was
medium
and
the
taste
was
very
caramellike
with
a
hint
of
smoke
on
the
tongue
finish
was
likewise
faintly
smoky
and
semidry
not
sweet
at
all
first
of
all
i
am
not
ashamed
to
say
that
i
was
impressed
secondly
is
it
too
much
to
ask
them
to
can
this
beer
i
would
readily
put
some
in
the
cooler
i
would
definitely
give
this
one
a
try
even
if
you
dont
care
for
typical
darks
i
would
give
it
a
2
255
i
dont
think
i
will
buy
it
again
but
its
not
bad
definately
worth
trying
atleast
once
heineken
dark
lager
35
o
this
beer
is
very
easy
to
drink
although
the
taste
is
a
little
bland
there
arent
any
off
flavors
i
had
one
this
weekend
and
was
pleasantly
surprised
it
was
a
nice
blend
of
flavors
with
good
color
and
smell
nothing
to
overpower
the
senses
but
nothing
to
offend
them
either
good
job
on
this
brew
its
beautiful
and
definitely
worth
the
price
overall
i
would
not
recommend
this
but
it
is
better
than
standard
heineken
which
is
one
of
the
worst
beers
ive
ever
had
i
guess
you
could
give
it
a
shot
once
but
i
would
never
buy
this
again
this
is
a
totally
decent
beer
12

and
a

body
is

is

aroma
with
mostly
fruit
and
caramel
slight
hint

short
sweet
finish
it
was
ok
with
steak
better
than
other
selections
at
this
place
tastes
somewhat
comparable
to
other
examples
of
the
style
i
have
tried
it
just
lacks
depth
generally
and
reminds
me
too
much
of
regular
heineken
in
the
end
overall
pretty
nice
looking
and
smelling
but
the
taste
and
mouthfeel
are
pretty
lackluster
o
looks
like
a
munich
dark
tastes
like
a
mexican
amber
does
improve
a
little
with
some
warming
and
significantly
better
than
the
widely
available
imported
lager
in
the
green
bottles
and
cans
flavor
is
similar
fairly
sweet
with
wet
paper
graininess
very
bland
and
dull

cereal
malt
oatmeal
and
brown
sugar
wet
stewed
grain
husks
watery
body
fairly
clean
aftertaste
not
something
id
revisit
its
a
laughable
feeble
attempt
at
a
dark
lager
this
one
poured
out
as
a
deep
amber
coloe
with
a
thin
fizzy
cream
colored
head
on
top
the
smell
of
the
beer
is
pretty
sweet
with
lots
of
caramel
notes
on
the
nose
the
taste
of
the
beer
was
also
on
the
sweeter
side
the
malts
were
nicely
roasted
also
the
mouthfeel
of
this
beer
was
decent
but
nothing
too
special
i
could
have
had
a
little
more
body
to
it
overall
this
beer
was
pretty
good
to
me
i
would
like
to
have
it
again
one
day
just
to
try
it
again
overall
man
are
some
folks
trying
to
hype
this
beer
not
nearly
worth
the
a
rating
to
some
and
not
close
to
a
b
either
this
is
just
a
typical
heineken
brewed
with
more
malt
pass
on
it
if
you
can
this
beer
is
an
especially
pleasing
brew
to
enjoy
its
a
nice
dark
lager
the
beer
has
a
smooth
taste
to
it
it
tastes
hoppy
and
has
a
nice
carmel
or
chocolate
flavor
to
it
because
of
all
that
is
in
it
i
cannot
really
name
what
makes
this
wonderful
flavor
except
for
one
of
those
things
being
hops
i
can
taste
malt
there
also
it
has
a
sort
of
dry
tannish
brown
head
the
head
gets
medium
large
the
color
of
the
beer
itself
is
about
lighter
than
guinness
but
darker
than
an
amber
ale
it
almost
has
the
consistency
and
color
of
guinness
but
lighter
the
smell
is
kind
of
of
caramel
because
of
how
the
whole
beer
yields
that
certain
taste
the
taste
is
in
my
opinion
delicious
enough
making
it
very
smooth
the
caramel
taste
is
very
very
pleasing
in
this
beer
it
being
very
smooth
makes
it
easy
to
drink
i
drank
it
down
within
ten
minutes
because
its
pleasing
and
smooth
i
really
like
this
beer
if
you
dont
like
dark
beers
dont
try
it
but
if
you
do
this
is
a
must
try
being
one
who
has
guinness
as
the
favorite
beer
this
one
fights
to
be
up
there
with
guinness
i
would
give
it
a
b
plus
just
because
i
save
the
a
region
for
extremely
pleasing
beers
i
was
told
this
wasnt
half
bad
though
it
was
by
a
wholesale
salesman
selling
it
it
pours
a
deep
dark
ruby
topped
by
a
finger
of
dusty
paletan
foam
the
nose
comprises
flaky
biscuits
caramel
and
a
vague
sense
of
mandarin
orange
syrup
the
taste
follows
suit
with
some
slightly
darker
caramel
some
very
light
cocoa
backing
that
up
and
a
slightly
lessvague
sense
of
the
mandarin
orange
syrup
the
body
is
a
rather
light
medium
with
a
light
moderate
carbonation
and
a
watery
feel
overall
i
gotta
say
i
was
pleasantly
surprised
by
this
beer
its
not
all
that
great
but
its
nowhere
near
offensive
and
it
borders
on
downright
easilydrinkable
in
fact
i
could
see
drinking
this
again
not
bad
for
once
heineken
overall
drinkability
while
i
dont
have
high
regard
for
its
light
lager
brother
this
beer
might
be
one
of
the
best
in
the
euro
dark
lager
style
at
least
as
far
as
ive
had
not
much
in
the
way
of
off
characters
except
for
the
slight
metallic
astringency
and
mild
acidity
but
that
might
be
a
result
of
shelf
life
not
amazing
in
any
sense
but
definitely
worth
a
try
overall
im
glad
i
tried
it
i
was
pleasantly
surprised
its
a
very
sessionable
brew
that
i
would
not
be
afraid
to
tote
to
a
party
of
nonbas
but
still
be
known
as
the
beer
expert
o
heineken
may
be
known
for
its
green
bottled
skunk
lager
but
theres
none
of
that
here
i
found
it
very
delicious
and
exceedingly
drinkable
pours
a
clear
dark
crimson
brown
with
a
1
inch
beige
head
that
fades
to
nothing
no
lacing
whatsoever
smell
is
of
toasted
malt
caramel
and
some
nutty
aromas
taste
is
of
caramel
malt
bread
and
nuts
mild
bitterness
on
the
palate
after
each
sip
this
beer
has
an
almost
sodalike
carbonation
with
a
very
crisp
mouthfeel
overall
this
is
a
pretty
good
dark
lager
from
heineken
that
is
much
better
than
their
regular
green
bottle
style
pours
a
clear
light
brown
color
fizzy
head
forms
and
retention
is
little
to
none
light
aroma
of
sugary
malts
and
noble
hops
in
the
flavor
a
crisp
caramel
maltyness
toasted
grain
hint
of
bitterness
and
a
more
or
less
clean
finish
very
unoffensive
and
easily
consumed
a
nice
macro
euro
dark
lager
that
has
no
unpleasant
qualities
but
little
else
to
offer
i
thought
this
was
sort
of
the
corona
of
holland
and
generally
wasnt
impressed
at
all
not
a
bad
beer
but
i
wish
it
was
more
like
the
green
with
that
said
if
you
hate
the
green
id
say
check
this
out
its
very
different
t
a
medium
light
body
some
sweet
notes
toast
flavour
bitterness
but
the
end
is
not
so
long
the
beer
is
a
dark
brown
color
with
red
highlights
and
a
bubbly
tan
head
that
quickly
faded
the
smell
is
mostly
roasted
malt
with
some
nutty
flavor
and
earthy
hops
tastes
a
bit
weak
there
are
flavors
of
roasted
malt
molasses
abd
copper
feels
thin
and
watery
with
low
carbonation
this
is
a
solid
brew
i
could
see
myself
drinking
this
if
there
isnt
craftbeer
to
choose
from
md
medium
body
somewhat
sticky
considering
abv
interesting
beer
interesting
to
drink
a
nonskunked
brew
from
heine
not
a
bad
beer
at
all
pours
brown
with
red
highlights
little
tan
head
with
lacing
very
big
on
the
malt
smell
sweet
tasting
roasted
coffee
with
light
hopping
lager
yeast
is
evident
easy
drinking
somewhat
comparable
to
negra
modelo
good
beer
enjoyable
even
certainly
better
than
its
green
bottled
lager
brother
rjt
i
had
some
chinese
food
tonight
with
my
wife
at
mandarin
gourmet
in
brookline
on
the
menu
the
beer
list
includes
one
offering
merely
shown
as
dark
beer
i
asked
the
server
and
he
replied
it
was
heineken
dark
i
hadnt
had
one
before
so
i
gave
a
bottle
a
try
poured
into
a
short
stemmed
water
goblet
dark
brown
color
with
red
highlights
got
a
decent
sized
head
with
a
sturdy
pour
smell
was
bready
and
malty
the
flavor
was
actually
decent
it
reminded
me
a
bit
of
a
cross
between
a
brown
ale
and
a
dubbel
it
had
the
similar
flavor
profile
of
each
a
bit
malty
like
a
brown
but
a
touch
of
sweetness
as
in
a
belgian
ale
mouthfeel
was
somewhat
thin
but
smooth
drinkability
was
surprisingly
good
for
a
euro
dark
beer
it
paired
well
with
the
food
and
was
a
lot
more
flavorful
than
a
run
of
the
mill
heineken
deasy
to
drink
just
not
interesting
to
drink
definitely
one
of
the
better
euro
dark
beers
no
similarity
in
comparison
to
regular
heineken
has
a
bittery
malty
taste
a
beautiful
dark
amber
color
minimal
head
and
a
slight
but
welcomed
aftertaste
definitely
a
beginner
beer
but
you
can
never
go
wrong
with
heiny
dark
d
considering
the
thin
body
and
low
abv
and
really
reserved
flavor
this
one
is
really
easy
to
drink
however
the
notsogreat
flavor
kind
of
takes
away
from
the
drinkability
d
easy
to
drink
my
second
euro
dark
lager
and
i
like
this
style
so
far
pours
a
deep
brown
russet
color
with
a
thick
soapy
off
white
head
and
some
lacing
smells
of
vanilla
and
barley
soaked
in
wet
dog
scent
tastes
of
barley
some
sweet
malts
and
a
little
hop
bitterness
mouthfeel
is
medium
with
minimal
carbonation
drinkability
is
decent
pours
a
dark
brown
with
ruby
highlights
one
finger
head
gone
in
a
jiffy
fruity
aroma
dominates
a
blend
of
prunes
and
apples
also
a
faint
malt
essence
coming
in
under
the
rest
taste
is
initially
covered
up
by
carbonation
but
malt
sweetness
eventually
emerges
and
fruity
hops
come
in
behind
the
rest
nothing
firm
and
distinct
about
this
dark
lager
but
several
qualities
are
muddled
together
vague
breadiness
long
into
the
aftertaste
medium
body
lack
of
excellence
and
clarity
leaves
me
done
at
one
a
friend
recommended
this
beer
for
me
to
try
and
im
glad
he
did
its
incredibly
hard
to
find
it
but
i
finally
found
it
after
looking
30
different
liquor
stores
i
finally
found
3
six
packs
at
a
bevmo
in
orange
county
and
bought
all
3
of
them
normally
i
cannot
drink
heineken
but
i
can
easily
say
this
is
brew
is
now
one
of
my
top
5
favorites
of
all
time
if
you
ever
get
a
chance
to
at
least
try
it
do
not
pass
it
up
this
beer
according
to
the
label
won
two
awards
in
paris
in
the
1800s
if
thats
the
only
critical
acclaim
this
beer
has
enjoyed
that
would
be
a
shame
i
would
definitely
recommend
this
beer
to
anyone
who
enjoys
a
good
dark
lager
just
fantastic
poured
into
a
pint
glass
a
dark
mahogany
with
a
nice
foamy
beige
2
finger
head
good
retention
and
substantial
lacing
slight
roasted
nutty
aroma
taste
was
dominated
by
sweet
malt
caramel
and
raisin
bread
a
mediumlight
body
with
big
carbonation
goes
down
easy
and
is
quite
refreshing
unintrusive
aftertaste
a
yearround
session
brew
and
much
more
likable
than
regular
heineken
lager
drinkability
average
drinkability
the
lasting
bitter
aftertaste
wears
on
my
palette
after
awhile
making
this
beer
a
shorter
than
wanted
experience
d
all
around
a
slightly
better
than
average
beer
and
one
preferible
to
the
mainstream
normal
heineken
d
above
average
this
is
a
much
better
beer
than
i
am
used
to
from
the
usually
embarrassing
heineken
a
bit
more
body
and
an
firmer
sense
of
self
would
make
this
beer
really
good
d
due
to
the
fact
that
it
taste
more
like
a
bock
makes
it
even
for
tastier
and
drinkable
for
me
d
tasty
goes
down
easily
not
too
filling
mild
kick
good
representation
of
style
i
found
this
beer
to
be
much
better
than
i
had
anticipated
i
was
pleasantly
surprised
to
find
that
this
beer
is
quite
sessionable
drinkability
nice
balance
of
a
lighter
lager
and
slightly
darker
tones
easy
to
drink
more
than
a
six
pack
heineken
dark
was
one
of
those
beers
i
drank
in
the
80s
when
i
wanted
something
different
that
was
before
i
got
into
the
craft
styles
this
poured

had
a
mild
mixture
of
caramel
malts
thin
hops
and
bread
the
taste
had
a
sweet
bitterness
like
an
esb
with
a
nudge
of
thin
hops
at
the
end
i
drank
this
quickly
and
easily
it
does
bring
back
some
memories
but
there
are
plenty
of
similar
and
superior
beers
to
choose
from
these
days
poured
from
a
12
ounce
bottle

no

a

tastes
consists
of
caramel

and
some
chocolate
thin
watery
mouthfeel
with
decent
carbonation
the
drinkability
is
below
average
not
much
to
get
excited
about
here
if
you
like
dark
beer
this
is
a
must
try
aroma
is
malty
but
not
skunky
it
pours
with
a
light
brown
creamy
long
lasting
head
is
a
clear
dark
caramel
color
smooth
and
creamy
to
the
palate
with
a
nutty
toasty
flavor
with
little
aftertaste
it
compliments
a
variety
of
foods
ie
brie
and
rich
cheeses
spicy
dishes
but
doesnt
overpower
like
guinness
low
alchohol
and
good
price
makes
it
a
good
choice
for
a
party
not
easy
to
find
its
worth
looking
for
drinkability
has
to
rank
high
on
drinkabilty
a
nice
balance
of
a
lighter
lager
and
slightly
darker
tones
a
very
great
session
dark
lager
a
good
beer
i
would
seek
out
again
though
i
wish
it
were
available
in
12
packs
somewhat
impressed
better
then
i
expected
i
would
drink
this
one
any
day
over
a
normal
heine
p
s
if
you
are
drinking
green
heineken
always
opt
for
the
heinecan
drinkablity
the
abv
obviously
isnt
a
problem
i
just
find
it
lacks
any
kind
of
oomph
so
1
bottle
at
a
sitting
is
enough
for
me
d
tasty
the
first
one
but
becomes
cloying
to
take
several
a
very
nice
dark
lager
while
its
somewhat
light
in
the
body
this
beer
has
a
firm
malt
base
it
is
smooth
creamy
with
just
enough
of
a
dark
malt
profile
to
give
it
character
while
its
by
far
not
a
hoppy
lager
it
finishes
dry
with
little
aftertaste
dvery
good
sessionable
beer
indeed
not
bad
i
would
have
it
again
if
someone
brought
it
to
a
bbq
or
something
d
good
it
was
too
easy
to
drink
actually
i
found
myself
wanting
to
gulp
it
down
and
not
write
down
notes
there
were
enough
complex
smells
and
flavors
to
keep
me
guessing
this
beer
would
be
good
by
itself
one
of
the
best
macro
beers
ive
had
in
a
long
time
i
had
trouble
believing
this
was
the
same
company
d
a
surprisingly
refreshing
and
complex
lager
especially
considering
its
evil
distant
cousin
the
heineken
pale
lager
nice
balance
of
malts
and
just
enough
bittering
hops
if
im
in
a
lager
mood
and
theres
no
micro
options
i
wont
hesitate
to
grab
a
few
of
these
poured
from
a
brown
12
oz
bottle
has
a
dark
amber
color
with
a
12
inch
head
smell
is
of
caramel
and
malts
taste
has
some
malts
and
caramel
a
little
milder
than
i
expected
feels
medium
bodied
in
the
mouth
and
has
average
drinkability
overall
this
is
a
fairly
good
beer
cheers
one
of
my
favorite
beers
be
far
highly
drinkable
if
you
can
find
it
its
that
damn
good
taste
is
exponentially
better
than
heineken
lager
but
still
is
not
all
that
tasty
a
bit
too
sweet
with
a
fake
chocolate
flavor
and
an
astringent
plasticy
aftertaste
body
is
light
and
only
slightly
watery
carbonation
is
adequate
i
would
probably
take
a
baltika
4
over
this
one
but
ive
yet
to
come
across
a
euro
dark
that
i
really
enjoy
drinkablity
well
done
brew
good
alternative
to
regular
heineken
very
drinkable
yet
presents
hearty
qualities
mfd
i
wish
this
beer
were
just
a
bit
thicker
i
good
offering
from
a
macro
beer
company
d
meh
pretty
average
brew
to
me
easy
to
drink
i
suppose
it
would
be
sessionable
if
you
had
no
other
alternative
pours
a
clear
dark
brownish
copper
color
with
a
very
thin
tan
colored
head
nose
is
dominated
by
sweet
malts
and
grains
with
a
hint
of
fruitiness
taste
is
roasted
malts
with
notes
of
caramel
and
dark
bread
a
strong
maltiness
is
present
both
upfront
and
in
the
finish
this
is
a
decent
beer
but
it
doesnt
really
have
any
distinguishing
characteristics
aside
from
the
strong
maltiness
i
wanted
to
like
it
more
but
couldnt
a
dark
amber
color
pour
with
a
small
offwhite

a
pretty
good

heineken
dark
lager
is
very
average
in
the
grand
scheme
of
beer
the
nose
is
weak
the
flavors
convoluted
and
uninspiring
and
its
not
enjoyable
that
being
said
i
dont
really
hate
it
theres
just
not
much
to
like
if
it
had
something
to
add
some
pizzazz
itd
be
dramatically
improved
maybe
some
hops
pretty
average
all
around
maybe
worth
a
try
but
i
wouldnt
suggest
seeking
it
out
d
easy
session
beer
ive
drank
this
beer
a
lot
just
not
recently
one
of
my
gateway
beers
its
good
to
see
that
this
is
one
that
i
still
enjoy
id
recommend
it
to
anyone
looking
for
a
bit
of
a
change
drinkable
despite
its
flaws
the
prospect
of
a
darker
heineken
excited
me
however
ill
stick
to
the
regular
stuff
not
a
very
good
beer
just
has
a
very
odd
taste
and
its
just
not
good
overall
not
too
bad
but
nothing
youd
put
near
the
top
of
your
list
either
i
always
find
this
on
the
beer
menu
in
thaichinesevietnamese
restaurants
but
never
try
it
glad
i
did
as
it
is
an
interesting
spin
by
this
huge
brewer
d
well
its
better
than
heinekens
lighter
offerings
why
dont
they
use
this
wonderful
brown
bottle
for
their
other
beers
maybe
then
they
wouldnt
have
such
a
bad
reputation
for
being
lightstruck
all
the
time
d
this
beer
was
just
okay
for
me
i
would
have
trouble
buying
it
if
it
was
next
to
something
else
in
the
store
d
goes
down
easily
hops
are
a
little
too
strong
for
my
taste
but
not
overpowering
crisp
finish
for
a
dark
lager
would
be
good
on
a
hot
day
would
pare
well
with
red
meat
its
not
bad
ive
had
worse
that
cost
more
than
this
it
wont
be
one
of
my
regulars
or
even
semiregulars
though
very
surprised
by
this
beer
it
is
an
awesome
combo
with
a
good
salmon
meal
pours
a
nice
rich
red
color
though
not
much
to
say
for
a
nice
frothy
head
the
flavor
is
right
on
for
a
dark
lager
not
too
powerful
but
still
great
i
got
a
cedarcoffee
dark
taste
from
it
this
may
be
one
of
my
new
favorite
brews
drinkability
nothing
jumped
out
at
me
i
was
expecting
more
flavor
and
body
very
bland
and
weak
either
i
got
an
old
bottle
or
this
is
a
really
poor
beer
overall
it
is
an
okay
beer
not
to
bad
pours
brown
into
the
glass
with
decent
head
that
sticks
it
out
a
little
smells
of
a
touch
of
yeast
maybe
a
bit

smacking

in

decently

with
a
touch
of

flavor
up

and
fades
off
to
a

flavor
and

highly
carbonated
better
than
this
beers
more
popular
brother
fairly
drinkable
feel
is
better
again
than
the
original
but
nothing
too
much
the
body
is
slight
but
there
and
the
carbonation
is
good
keeps
it
refreshing
d
while
this
is
certainly
better
than
most
other
heineken
beers
its
still
wildly
uneven
on
the
whole
well
its
better
than
the
usual
heineken
in
the
green
bottle
actually
a
beautiful
brown
color
in
the
glass
with
a
nice
small
head
that
stays
with
it
taste
wise
it
feels
like
there
is
some
potential
at
first
but
once
swallowed
you
just
get
blandness
def
above
average
but
not
by
much
drinkability
sits
heavier
than
the
mouthfeel
would
indicate
flavor
is
mild
not
a
great
black
lager
but
i
could
drink
it
i
suppse
an
ok
dark
lager
it
tasted
better
on
my
first
six
pack
not
sure
yet
if
theyre
be
a
3rd
average
stuff
d
drinkability
was
a
huge
disappointment
dump
and
avoid
at
all
cost
back
in
college
i
would
often
treat
myself
to
a
six
pack
if
i
had
some
extra
cash
or
i
was
just
feeling
special
its
a
very
good
dunkel
completely
different
in
taste
from
regular
heineken
lager
the
heavier
flavor
and
thick
appearance
are
great
although
not
real
complex
in
flavor
i
think
the
overall
taste
does
this
beer
justice
my
biggest
drawback
is
the
overinflated
price
of
heineken
if
i
want
to
enjoy
a
good
dark
beer
i
can
save
a
couple
of
bucks
and
pick
up
lots
of
other
choices
just
as
good
if
not
better
than
this
one
heineken
i
apologize
for
my
previous
bias
not
too
shabby
though
one
can
do
better
in
the
category
makes
a
nice
changeup
in
their
portfolio
and
shows
they
dont
only
brew
pale
colored
beer
for
a
beer
from
a
massmarket
brewer
this
isnt
too
bad
nothing
about
it
is
going
to
excite
a
true
beerlover
but
its
a
whole
lot
better
than
the
regular
heineken
thats
for
sure
slightly
malty
and
bready
with
a
good
nose
and
a
halfway
decent
head
the
taste
is
good
if
only
there
was
more
of
it
i
knocked
this
one
back
in
no
time
flat
the
way
i
might
with
a
good
quality
root
beer
theres
not
a
lot
to
savour
and
enjoy
here
but
what
little
there
is
deserves
some
acknowledgement
from
those
of
us
who
appreciate
a
good
beer
nice
drinking
but
nothing
out
of
the
ordinary
medium
feel
with
nice
bubbly
carbonation
this
would
be
drinkable
if
i
could
get
past
the
diacetyl
the
taste
is
fairly
sweet
with
a
hint
of
bitterness
somewhat
toasty
with
caramel
but
develops
a
faint
unpleasant
burnt
taste
before
a
fairly
nice
grainy
finish
its
somewhat
fizzy
and
thin
with
a
weak
watery
fizzy
palate
that
vanishes
quickly
to
leave
almost
no
remnant
in
the
mouth
it
also
overall
gets
worse
as
one
drinks
it
overall
not
a
bad
drinking
beer
is
it
worth
the
money
probably
not
but
more
so
than
its
greenbottled
i
just
paid
nine
bucks
to
drink
skunk
urine
counterpart
i
bought
this
beer
expecting
much
worse
things
and
was
pleasantly
surprised
i
havent
had
a
heineken
dark
in
years
decades
is
more
like
it
and
im
no
fan
of
their
lager
counterpart
which
to
me
is
just
a
slightly
sweeter
version
of
any
number
of
characterless
american
macros
enough
said
the
beer
was
a
bit
of
a
pleasant
surprise
just
because
i
was
expecting
so
little
it
pours
a
nice
amber
copper
color
very
clear
clean
with
a
decent
off
white
head
that
hangs
around
a
bit
and
laces
too
the
smell
is
nutty
malts
caramel
and
an
off
medicinal
quality
although
some
of
the
off
smells
dissipate
as
things
settle
the
smell
is
the
weakest
link
the
taste
is
subdued
it
has
a
nice
caramel
backbone
plenty
of
caramelized
malts
some
roasted
flavors
and
a
bit
of
a
metallic
edge
as
well
the
beer
is
approaching
a
medium
body
with
not
much
carbonation
the
finish
is
a
bit
off
and
thats
where
some
of
the
metallic
flavors
emerge
not
much
aftertaste
one
way
or
another
not
a
bad
beer
and
im
glad
i
gave
it
a
try
d
not
sure
if
i
would
have
this
again
it
would
really
have
to
pair
well
with
the
food
i
would
eat
not
for
casual
consumption
good
all
around
beer
try
it
if
you
havent
you
can
tell
its
heineken
when
you
taste
it
if
youre
picking
this
up
thinking
it
will
be
a
completely
new
and
different
experience
than
heineken
lager
just
put
the
bottle
back
down
that
being
said
this
is
a
decent
dunkel
not
the
best
by
far
but
certainly
not
a
purchasethat
you
will
regret
i
mentioned
heines
lager
because
this
is
literally
just
a
dark
version
of
their
standard
lager
no
major
difference
except
that
it
has
a
more
pleasant
scent
to
it
and
the
taste
has
a
heavier
maltinfluence
i
wouldnt
mind
picking
up
a
sixer
of
this
again
in
the
near
future

while
never

it

very

a

for
those
who
say
they
like

doesnt
last
too
long
unfortunately

looking

smell
isnt
too
strong
to
begin
but
the
lightly
malty
caramel
alcohol
smells
i
do
pick
up
are
subtle
but
nice
at
first
but
then
turn
into
an
almost
nauseatingly
artificial
syrupy
caramel
smell
tastes
of
some
lightly
roasty
malts
a
touch
of
yeast
and
has
a
very
quick
finish
and
basically
no
bitterness
body
is
a
tad
watery
yet
has
a
fairly
rich
full
flavor
for
a
darklager
nonetheless
overall
a
good
easy
drinking
darker
session
beer
not
terrible
but
i
wouldnt
get
this
again
d
this
is
an
okay
brew
i
thought
it
improved

it
warmed
up
not
bad
at
all
for
the
style
lacks
the
euroskunk
and
sulfurish
blandness
of
its
pale
counterpart
not
a
bad
brew
for
a
conventionalalmost
pedestrian
sessionable
dark
lager
acceptable

i
will
not
be

this
one

overall
a
pretty
good
beer
could
use
a
little
refinement
on
the
malt
but
not
too
bad
i
would
have
probably
guessed
this
one
was
a
decent
brown
ale
if
i
didnt
see
the
bottle
this
one
is
definately
worth
a
try
completely
ordinary
dark
lager
basically
overalla
pleasent
surprise
this
is
a
fairly
well
flavored
and
deviously
drinkable
dark
lager
that
also
isnt
too
overbearing
this
could
end
up
becoming
a
guilty
pleasure
for
me
from
time
to
time
the
beer
pours
a
beautiful
ruby
red
color
with
a
thick
frothy
tan
head
that
quickly
fades

the

that
boasts
of
pale

with

it

it
is
a

this
is
a
good
dark
lager
and
another
fine
offering
from
heineken
it
goes
down
easy
a
good
drinker
nothing
at
all
like
the
much
more
popular
green
heineken
poured
very
red
nice
slightly
offwhite

which
almost
appeared
to
have
a
slightly
creamy
consistency
nice
lacing
but
the
head
disapeared
a
little
too
fast
the
smell
was
very
malty
and
a
bit
sweet
too
taste
was
of
a
dry
roasted
malt
with
almost
a
toasted
aftertaste
very
nice
the
mouth
feel
was
a
lot
thinner
than
i
would
have
thought
by
simply
looking
at
it
and
smelling
it
so
much
so
that
i
rated
it
as
average
that
is
really
that
only
real
negative
thing
i
have
to
say
about
this
stuff
is
that
it
is
really
thin
other
than
that
i
thought
it
was
great
mouthfeel
was
all
right
nothing
spectacular
a
somewhat
drinkable
beer
though
much
much
better
than
the
greenbottled
crap
i
am
a
true
lover
of
lagers
in
all
styles
that
said
i
absolutely
despise
heineken
its
one
of
the
worst
beers
out
there
and
its
high
price
and
huge
popularity
constantly
infuriate
me
heinekens
trademark
skunky
flavor
has
been
the
subject
of
countless
beergeek
discussions
and
i
for
one
have
resolved
never
to
touch
the
stuff
again
so
when
i
stumbled
across
a
sample
of
heineken
dark
i
wasnt
sure
what
to
expect
i
approached
the
beer
with
an
open
mind
and
was
pleased
to
discover
it
didnt
have
the
sewerlike
skunkiness
that
makes
their
regular
pisslager
so
hateful
so
is
the
beer
a
success
does
it
redeem
the
dutch
as
a
nation
of
beermakers
i
hate
grolsch
and
amstel
too
not
exactly
the
beer
is
too
sweet
and
remains
cloying
long
after
the
swallow
ive
experienced
good
german
dunkel
lagers
and
i
recognize
that
the
big
malt
sweetness
is
a
force
to
be
reckoned
with
and
that
a
delicate
interplay
with
the
hops
is
necessary
to
keep
the
beer
from
going
overboard
however
either
the
makers
of
heiny
dont
know
jack
about
hops
or
wanted
to
make
the
beer
as
licoricesweet
as
possible
to
appeal
to
the
tasteless
masses
a
somewhat
appealing
dark
ruby
liquid
sustains
a
buoyant
persistent
head
with
a
heaping
aroma
of
sweet
caramel
and
molasses
the
flavor
is
initially
appealing
but
there
is
no
dryness
no
finish
simply
a
lingering
sweetness
that
tastes
like
red
licorice
a
confection
i
hate
with
a
similar
acuity
to
that
of
yellow
heineken
the
beer
is
not
bad
in
fact
with
the
proper
caramelized
dish
it
might
be
pleasing
at
this
particular
moment
in
time
though
it
is
too
sweet
too
cloying
although
i
am
pleased
to
say
it
is
not
nearly
as
disgustingly
bileinducing
as
that
dribble
that
comes
in
the
green
bottles
drinkability
a
worthwhile
session
beer
for
the
most
part
i
enjoyed
it
i
cant
say
that
i
like
heineken
lager
but
i
do
find
it
to
be
drinkable
heineken
dark
though
needs
a
recipe
change
the
dr
jekyl

is
okay
but
the

is

not
nice
enough

almost
even

in

nice

off

though
it
did
not

the

malty

even
touches
of
chocolate
again
the
flavour
is
much
more
malty
and
even
has
hints
of
chocolate
milk
small
hop
bit
at
the
end
kinda
average
on
the
palate
does
tend
towards

near

end

a

dark
lager
at

i
would
drink
again

hardly
a

even
the

pinch
this
brew
is
a
clear
dark
brown
colored
drink
with
a
decent
sized
brown
bubbly
head
topping
it
off
some
caramel
malt
scent
clean
tasting
some
roasted
malt
tones
some
slight
hop
bitterness
mediumthin
bodied
i
know
what
the
idea
is
that
theyre
going
for
but
theyre
keeping
the
flavor
lowkey
to
attract
the
people
who
dont
like
the
taste
of
beer
not
bad
but
dont
buy
it
unless
its
on
sale
or
the
best
thing
in
the
bar
smells
strong
of
malt
with
a
malty
bready
taste
the
beer
says
what
it
needs
to
say
lets
you
think
about
it
for
a
bit
then
goes
away
and
expects
you
to
take
another
sip
i
could
have
one
or
two
of
these
but
im
certainly
not
sitting
back
with
a
six
pack
to
pass
the
waning
hours
worth
a
try
if
its
free
like
this
one
was
zum
wohl
the
pour
was
dark
copper
with
a
nice
threequarter
inch
head
that
quickly
dissapated
to
a
thin
foam
the
remaining
head
stuck
to
the
glass
nicely
the
smell
was
light
and
sweet
with
no
real
great
overtones
of
anything
other
than
malt
the
drink
starts
very
sweet
with
a
slight
hop
bite
in
the
middle
followed
by
a
smooth
clean
finish
with
little
or
no
aftertaste
this
would
make
a
great
lawnmower
beer
drinkable
great
for
a
macro
but
i
can
find
better
clear
tealike
brown
color
with
a
middling
head
in
size
and
overall
duration
laces
in
spare
simple
strings
some
pumpernickle
to
the
overall
bready
aroma
mouthfeel
is
a
tad
on
the
watery
side
the
flavor
is
pleasantly
neutral
in
malt
sweetness
with
a
decided
graininess
to
add
some
texture
low
degree
of
hoppiness
overall
the
finish
is
the
most
distinct
part
of
the
beer
light
but
dry
with
a
continued
grain
fabric
the
attenuation
and
nonthreatening
middleoftheroad
flavor
leads
me
to
believe
that
a
lot
of
people
could
find
this
brew
accessible
if
you
have
to
drink
heineken
this
is
the
one
to
get
i
have
a
nostalgiac
affection
for
this
beer
as
it
was
the
very
first
dark
beer
that
i
tried
long
before
i
was
on
the
craft
brew
path
it
pours
a
deep
mahogany
with
a
beige
head
that
quickly
disappears
the
aroma
is
of
burnt
toast
roasted
nuts
and
bittersweet
chocolate
very
appealing
imo
unfortunately
the
taste
doesnt
back
up
the
promise
of
the
aroma
toasty
roasted
grain
flavors
come
through
in
the
flavor
with
some
nondescript
simple
sweetness
not
bad
just
not
enough
oomph
its
a
very
clean
brew
that
could
use
a
bit
more
malt
to
add
some
character
and
mouthfeel
still
this
is
not
a
bad
choice
if
youre
looking
for
a
lightbodied
dark
beer
a
nice
deep
maroon
color
with
a
creamy
tan
head
smells
of
roasted
malt
and
sweetness
this
is
much
better
than
heineken
lager
still
a
little
too
thin
and
sweet
to
be
considered
a
very
good
beer
in
my
opinion
but
much
improved
over
their
flagship
brew
wow
i
was
shocked
when
i
tried
this
beer
i
was
expecting
the
flavor
of
heineken
lager
which
i
do
not
care
for
but
it
was
not
the
case
with
this
beer
this
beer
was
totally
different
taste
was
very
sweet
and
nutty
since
it
is
a
dark
beer
i
was
expecting
some
sweetness
but
i
could
not
believe
how
sweet
this
beer
was
i
drank
this
beer
twice
since
i
really
do
like
it
i
did
however
get
a
slight
stomach
ache
afterwards
wasnt
sure
if
it
was
the
beer
so
i
drank
it
again
another
day
but
got
the
same
feeling
in
my
stomach
again
weird
because
the
beer
tastes
great
i
would
definately
drink
this
beer
again
if
i
didnt
feel
sick
after
drinking
it
bottom
line
if
you
like
malty
flavors
and
you
are
at
a
bar
with
a
limited
beer
selection
give
heine
dark
a
try
otherwise
it
is
simply
a
medicore
dark
lager
this
was
much
better
than
i
expected
it
was
a
nice
brownred
color
with
a
small
head
that
faded
to
a
lace
the
smell
was
malty
the
taste
was
malty
as
well
with
a
little
bit
of
hops
at
the
end
the
mouthfeel
was
very
good
it
was
nice
and
meaty
and
had
well
rounded
edges
in
accords
to
cabonation
i
could
make
this
a
session
beer
easily
i
cant
believe
i
am
saying
this
but
for
a
beer
brewed
by
heineken
this
is
a
fairly
decent
beer
it
poured
a
medium
sized
tan
rocky
head
with
finemedium
sized
bubbles
that
mostly
diminished
there
was
carbonation
observed
and
it
had
an
opaque
body
with
a
reddishbrown
hue
the
nose
consisted
of
malt
and
caramel
with
a
sweet
brown
flavor
the
mouthfeel
was
smooth
slightly
tingly
thin
textured
and
lightmedium
bodied
the
downside
is
that
it
lacks
in
the
flavor
department
comments

chase
this
with
a
shot
of
jaegermeister
on
the
pour
a
deep
incarnadine
color
the
head
miniscule
the
color
something
akin
to
dirty
grey
the
lace
awol
nose
prototypical
malt
and
nothing
else
the
start
slightly
sweet
with
the
top
cadaverous
and
the
finish
ferine
in
its
acidic
bite
hops
as
one
would
expect
for
the
style
and
brewery
sparse
dry
aftertaste
another
habeas
corpus
beer
wheres
the
body
and
wheres
the
flavor
not
a
bad
beer
but
not
great
its
a
cookie
cutter
example
of
a
dark
euro
at
first
pour
it
comes
out
a
very
very
deep
mohogany
with
a
tan
head
that
fades
fast
wit
hthe
first
sip
youll
notice
a
good
amount
of
malt
and
a
lsightly
thin
mouthfeel
but
not
overly
watery
some
hop
notes
are
found
at
the
end
but
not
as
much
as
you
would
expect
not
a
bad
beer
if
you
cant
find
better
this
beer
pours
a
dark
amber
color
with
a
small
head
and
moderate
lacing
on
the
glass
the
aroma
is
slightly
sweet
and
interesting
i
really
had
decent
hopes
for
this
one
because
i
thought
that
since
it
was
dark
it
would
be
decent
not
sucky
like
normal
heineken
i
was
wrong
the
taste
was
a
little
malty
but
pretty
crappy
and
enjoyable
the
taste
was
very
reminescent
of
normal
heineken
with
a
bit
more
sweetness
didnt
like
it
much
i
liked
the
beer
at
first
but
towards
the
end
of
the
glass
i
got
bored
with
it
nothing
wrong
with
it
over
all
okay
balance
just
slightly
boring
deep
mahogany
body
really
throws
off
some
red
highlights
topped
by
a
decent
but
loose
light
tan
head
that
relatively
quickly
fades
to
nothing
aroma
of
slight
whiskey
malt
and
old
socks
maybe
moldy
malt
taste
is
slightly
better
with
a
wet
grain
taste
that
gives
way
to
a
touch
of
roastiness
hint
of
bitterness
on
the
dry
finish
actually
quite
astringent
mouthfeel
is
harsh
with
moderate
but
noticeable
carbonation
atop
a
weak
body
drinkability
is
poor
this
is
a
typical
macro
style
lager
with
a
bit
more
character
but
i
still
dont
care
for
it
in
summary
a
decent
product
not
as
drinkable
as
some
other
similar
beers
but
much
less
offensive
than
the
regular
heineken
lager
the
downside
of
that
is
we
become
too
accustomed
to
the
lager
as
a
bare
minimum
beer
therefore
we
give
little
credibility
to
the
other
heinekens
on
the
market
get
past
that
commercial
stigmata
then
you
can
enjoy
their
more
craftier
brews
this
pours
with
light
brownish
head
that
settles
on
top
of
clear
ruby
liquid
tinged
with
brown
dark
malts
and
some
caramel
detected
in
the
nose
taste
is
pleasing
to
the
palate
with
notes
of
light
roasted
malt
that
offers
a
bit
of
dryness
minimal
hop
bitterness
just
enough
perhaps
and
again
some
scant
caramel
flavors
pop
up
midway
finshes
smooth
and
satisfying
with
a
light
light
bittersweetness
that
quietly
fades
away
fresh
samples
really
make
all
the
difference
here
a
great
intro
to
dark
beers
for
someone
curious
about
them
drinkability
totally
unexciting
why
bother
a
decent
example
of
a
macro
european
dark
lager
head
is
dark
white
with
very
little
lacing
taste
is
of
chocolatey
malts
with
a
slight
hop
taste
the
finish
is
a
bit
rough
burning
on
the
way
down
i
liked
this
somewhat
i
wish
it
were
cheaper
here
in
the
states
as
i
might
try
it
more
often
not
a
great
dark
lager
but
not
bad
heineken
trying
to
make
a
decent
brew
this
dunkel
is
not
that
bad
but
then
again
its
not
that
good
pours
a
very
dark
ruby
amber
with
a
tan
fizzy
head
high
levels
of
artificial
carbonation
this
beer
leaves
practically
no
lace
definitely
a
macro
were
dealing
with
here
the
aroma
is
an
off
astringent
metallic
scent
and
underneath
of
that
there
is
sweet
malt
with
nutty
tones
smells
pretty
good
lighter
in
flavor
than
it
looks
this
is
a
the
caramel
malt
is
toned
down
and
there
are
some
fruit
tones
in
the
background
all
tied
together
with
a
little
bite
of
alcohol
mouthfeel
is
thin
lacking
a
lot
of
body
here
overall
though
i
would
order
when
while
out
at
a
place
with
a
shabby
selection
depending
on
the
price
i
wouldnt
drink
that
many
of
these
because
its
nothing
special
but
it
does
pull
off
an
overall
pretty
enjoyable
beer
that
could
be
consumed
in
quantity
really
this
beer
is
not
all
that
bad
in
fact
its
a
decent
flavorful
dark
lager
pours
deep
brownishred
with
a
slight
whispy
head
roasted
grain
and
hop
aroma
is
faint
but
appealing
initial
taste
is
sweet
and
malty
very
drinkable
light
body
and
slightly
watery
mouthfeel
but
not
nearly
as
light
as
expected
this
beer
is
certainly
overpriced
but
it
is
enjoyable
the
taste
is
very
sweet
for
a
socalled
dark
beer
and
i
was
not
so
fond
of
this
there
was
a
blend
of
malts
with
again
granny
smith
apples
it
was
so
strange
i
cant
say
it
was
a
horrible
taste
but
it
was
not
like
a
dark
beer
it
only
had
very
subtle
roasty
flavors
and
you
had
to
have
a
hunting
dog
to
find
the
roasty
aromas
or
flavors
in
this
one
taste
trys
far
too
hard
to
be
inoffensive
theres
a
little
bit
of
roasted
malt
here
but
not
enough
to
be
a
good
dark
beer
bland
bittering
hops
and
none
too
many
of
them
the
only
redemption
is
a
mildly
interesting
bittersweet
finish
would
work
as
a
session
beer
in
a
pinch
if
it
wasnt
so
overcarbonated
dark
ruby
brown
with
a
minimal
amount
of
head
consisting
of
atypically
small
bubbles
dissipates
quickly
with
minimal
lacing
smell
is
rather
hohumsomewhat
weak
and
dominated
by
grain
tastes
with
only
a
bit
of
roasted
darkness
the
darkness
of
this
beer
is
also
rather
weak
in
its
taste
yeast
flavors
come
through
every
bit
as
strongly
turns
a
little
crisper
at
the
end
which
is
pleasant
mouthfeel
is
a
bit
clingy
but
remains
lighter
than
it
might
be
its
as
drinkable
as
any
mainstream
brew
a
category
in
which
heineken
comfortably
resides
pours
a
dark
brown
color
with
a
tan
head
that
lasted
through
a
few
swallows
its
nice
to
taste
a
heinekin
product
in
a
brown
bottle
nice
malty
taste
kind
of
reminds
me
of
a
newcastle
brown
i
really
like
this
stuff
it
would
really
make
a
nice
session
beer
pours
a
clear
dark
brownish
copper
color
with
a
very
thin
tan
colored
head
nose
is
dominated
by
sweet
malts
and
grains
with
a
hint
of
fruitiness
taste
is
roasted
malts
with
notes
of
caramel
and
dark
bread
a
strong
maltiness
is
present
both
upfront
and
in
the
finish
this
is
a
decent
beer
but
it
doesnt
really
have
any
distinguishing
characteristics
aside
from
the
strong
maltiness
i
note
with
satisfaction
that
this
beer
is
packaged
in
brown
glass
rather
than
the
familiar
heineken
green
heineken
special
dark
beer
is
a
well
built
dark
beer
that
satisfied
my
taste
for
both
a
stout
and
a
porter
at
the
same
time
although
a
bit
thin
for
a
stout
or
porter
if
your
not
too
picky
this
one
will
be
a
winner
it
was
for
me
pours
a
dark
tea
color
with
a
2
finger
tan
head
the
smell
is
extremely
faint
maybe
a
little
caramel
and
slightly
sweet
smell
to
it
but
really
hard
to
tell
it
has
a
slightly
creamy
mouthfeel
with
an
earthymusty
taste
but
not
offensive
it
has
a
light
to
medium
body
and
almost
a
bit
watery
at
the
finish
okay
beer
prosit
light
brown
garnet
hue
w
a
head
that
settle
into
a
thin
but
persistent
layer
the
aroma
consists
of
lightly
toasty
munich
malt
a
bit
of
dark
caramel
and
a
touch
of
chocolate
malt
hop
nose
is
completely
absent
the
malt
profile
and
body
is
lacking
for
a
dunkel
consisting
of
understated
munich
malt
and
light
chocolate
hop
bitterness
is
low
and
lets
residual
malt
sweetness
to
assert
itself
theres
really
not
much
else
there
flavorwise
the
finish
is
a
bit
grainy
and
sweet
this
is
a
pretty
insipid
example
of
the
style
reddishbrown
tan
head
that
doesnt
hold
no
real
smell
to
speak
of
no
real
taste
to
speak
of
either
slight
bitter
aftertaste
watery
darkbrownred
with
tan
head
aroma
was
not
appealling
in
the
least
and
try
as
i
did
i
could
not
identify
any
specific
smells
highly
carbonated
after
puring
in
the
bottle
it
fizzed
like
sode
for
a
short
time
malty
and
moderately
bitter
i
ended
up
not
wanting
to
finish
this
beer
had
to
force
my
way
through
it
almost
no
flavor
and
the
metallic
aftertaste
was
unpleasant
to
say
the
least
not
bad
looking
though
notes
not
too
shabby
if
you
like
dark
lagers
this
is
not
really
that
bad
it
is
somewhat
middle
of
the
road
but
there
are
no
off
flavours
or
complexities
that
jump
out
and
make
your
taste
buds
scream
sweet
with
a
pronounced
apple
aroma
some
caramel
malt
but
not
much
mildly
hopped
mouthfeel
was
thin
not
very
satisfying
unless
having
it
on
tap
in
europe
is
dramatically
different
than
having
it
in
the
bottle
which
i
have
never
had
i
am
really
surprised
to
see
such
low
scores
here
i
found
this
to
be
a
really
nice
dry
lager
this
was
an
odd
beer
for
me
it
reminds
me
of
one
of
those
nonalcoholic
malt
drinks
the
appearance
is
nice
dark
brown
body
with
great
tan
and
lace
the
smell
is
overly
sweet
and
only
has
strong
tone
of
malt
it
has
chocolate
over
sweet
taste
with
a
very
chalky
aftertaste
it
has
a
full
body
o
this
beer
isnt
too
sweet
so
it
is
easy
to
drink
but
doesnt
taste
much
like
a
bier
overall
what
we
enjoyed
most
about
this
brew
was
the
look
the
coloring
was
nice
and
the
head
was
clean
and
inviting
the
flavoring
however
proved
to
be
one
of
the
sweetest
things
weve
ever
had
the
sugars
were
synthetic
like
aspartame
which
was
so
overpowering
it
made
this
beer
quite
one
dimensional
it
was
just
so
overpowering
and
the
bottle
was
actually
pretty
hard
to
finish

a

beige

that
goes
out
fast
sweet

very

reminds
me
of
a
beer
an
uncle
of
mine
was
giving
me
when
i
was
56
years
old
a
kids
beer
it
was
that
which
hooked
up
on
beers
i
guess
so
i
really
liked
this
beer
also
nostalgia
o
not
a
beer
overall
way
to
sweet
less
sugarmore
hops
please
compared
to
other
oud
bruins
ive
had
this
is
not
exactly
good
i
dont
believe
its
in
the
belgian
style
or
intended
to
be
the
carbonation
helps
a
bit
but
theres
just
too
much
residual
sweetness
o
absolutely
terrible
one
of
the
worst
if
not
the
worst
beer
ive
ever
had
a
complete
waste
of
time
and
money
my
advise
dont
try
it
picked
up
a
bottle
at
superfood
in
aruba
color
was
a
nice
brown
fairly
flat
appearing
the
sweet
aroma
should
have
been
my
first
clue
that
i
would
not
enjoy
this
flavor
was
a
sickening
cloying
sweetness
that
overwhelmed
any
other
tastes
i
suppose
some
hint
of
malt
but
it
was
like
drinking
sugar
water
mouthfeel
was
slightly
sickening
i
managed
to
sample
half
the
bottle
before
giving
up
and
dumping
it
i
apologize
if
this
is
to
style
as
it
is
not
one
im
used
to
but
i
have
to
rate
it
based
on
how
i
enjoyed
it
and
it
was
terrible
very
common
drink
a
disappointing
experience
corn
taste
is
beer
is
just
the
worst
the
beer
pours
a
dark
brownishamber
color
with
a
tan
head
the
aroma
is
very
faint
but
i
get
a
little
bit
of
toffee
the
flavor
is
more
pronounced
i
get
some
toffee
and
some
nuttyness
from
the
malt
the
beer
is
fairly
sweet
medium
mouthfeel
and
medium
carbonation
overall
this
tastes
like
a
watered
down
english
brown
ale
overall
not
a
fan
i
dont
really
know
the
style
very
well
yet
but
i
definitely
wont
be
picking
this
one
up
again
too
thin
water
and
overly
sweet
i
couldnt
finish
it
thanks
to
my
student
for
brining
it
in
but
ill
have
to
pass
next
time
i
couldnt
rate
this
properly
because
there
isnt
a
style
for
this
on
ba
so
i
dont
know
what
the
guidelines
are
for
the
style
it
is
currently
categorized
incorrectly
as
a
flanders
oud
bruin
btw
this
is
not
a
flanders
oud
bruin
but
a
dutch
oud
bruin
a
completely
different
style
dutch
oud
bruin
is
a
dark
sweet
lowalcohol
lager
all
the
dutch
lager
brewers
produce
one
they
vary
in
strength
from
2
5
abv
to
3
5
abv
as
a
beer
its
not
the
best
but
i
think
it
fits
the
style
fairly
well
i
personally
liked
it
and
recommend
trying
it
at
least
once
again
i
am
not
saying
this
is
a
bad
beer
i
am
just
stating
i
dont
like
it
definitely
not
for
everybody
but
worth
trying
as
its
a
style
youre
not
going
to
find
outside
of
holland
i
tried
this
on
recent
trip
to
amsterdam
this
beer
tastes
like
root
beer
i
felt
like
i
was
sucking
on
a
cube
of
brown
sugar
beyond
the
incredible
sweet
stickiness
there
was
virtually
no
body
to
this
and
very
little
carbonation
maybe
im
just
not
familiar
with
the
old
brown
style
but
i
cant
think
of
a
reason
why
i
would
want
to
every
try
this
again
smell
is
sugary
very
very
malty
and
thats
what
the
taste
is
pure
malt
no
hops
barely
any
alcohol
in
itself
no
emotions
nothing
bring
me
a
coke
for
that
matter
sweet
i
was
going
to
make
it
a
one
word
review
but
i
wasnt
allowed
to
this
beer
is
almost
overpoweringly
sweet
and
if
you
arent
prepared
for
that
then
you
might
find
it
quite
suprising
it
is
also
2
5
so
is
not
very
rewarding
even
if
you
do
manage
to
get
it
all
down
the
prominent
heineken
logo
leads
one
to
expect
some
form
of
lagery
goodness
but
i
guess
variety
is
the
spice
of
life
and
heineken
ought
to
be
appluaded
for
making
something
out
of
the
massproduced
norm
but
this
one
is
just
too
sweet
and
not
hoppy
enough
for
my
unrefined
tastebuds
sweet
and
a
little
smokey
in
flavor
kind
of
woody
too
though
i
couldnt
place
the
woodiness
not
for
the
average
but
would
also
be
a
good
starter
beer
for
those
that
judge
a
beer
by
its
color
this
is
a
black
beer
darker
than
guiness
from
what
i
recall
but
not
near
as
heavy
and
did
i
say
sweet
this
is
considered
an
after
dinner
or
desert
beer
from
what
the
waiter
told
me
and
is
also
rather
low
in
alchohol
content
my
wife
even
liked
it
and
she
hates
beer
dark
brown
appearance
with
a
healthy
head
sweet
dark
grain
prunelike
aroma
sweetness
is
the
predominate
flavor
with
pruneraisin
molasses
essence
and
only
hints
of
bitterness
mouthfeel
is
full
semislick
not
bad
at
all
just
a
bit
cloyingly
sweet
o
not
very
complex
but
whats
there
is
enjoyable
the
medium
body
focuses
on
crispness
and
leans
pretty
light
toasty
dryness
builds
gently
yes
the
legendary
woodychandler
comes
through
again
with
another
canned
beer
poured
from
a
12
oz
can
has
a
dark
brown
color
with
a
12
inch
head
smell
is
nutty
a
bit
of
hops
taste
is
well
balanced
hops
and
malts
a
bit
of
nuts
very
easy
drinking
feels
medium
bodied
in
the
mouth
and
overall
is
an
enjoyable
beer
a
nice
loud
crack
revealed
a
brimful
can
so
in
salute
to
the
brewers
i
utilized
an
inverted
glug
the
pseudocascade
was
brilliant
finally
settling
into
two
fingers
of
dense
foamy
lighttan
with
limited
retention
although
it
was
already
beginning
to
evince
some
great
lacing
color
was
more
coppery
than
brown
srm
22
but
with
nequality
clarity
nose
had
a
really
malty
sweetness
and
i
would
have
sworn
that
i
was
drinking
an
ale
mouthfeel
was
mediumtofull
and
the
taste
was
kind
of
chocolaty
sort
of
nutty
and
very
reminiscent
of
newcastle
brown
ale
did
i
just
type
that
well
i
kid
you
not
and
if
this
is
a
lager
then
i
am
deeply
impressed
the
hops
were
not
what
the
verbiage
had
led
me
to
expect
as
they
were
pretty
much
not
discernible
but
the
finish
had
the
same
sweet
malt
flavors
that
i
usually
get
in
an
ale
this
would
be
worth
seeking
out
as
a
novelty
but
if
you
are
into
brown
ales
i
am
not
then
you
should
definitely
see
how
this
stacks
up
against
some
of
your
faves
poured
to
a
great
off
white
head
with
great
creaminess
and
excellent
retention
and
lacing
appearance
was
a
clear
dark
copper
color
aroma
was
of
malt
and
caramel
with
some
fruit
notes
tasted
very
malty
with
strong
notes
of
chocolate
caramel
and
toffee
nice
creamy
mouth
feel
with
a
sweet
to
dry
aftertaste
slight
bite
at
the
end
the
flavor
reminded
me
of
a
lager
version
of
sam
smiths
brown
ale
it
has
good
malt
balance
a
wonderful
hop
bitterness
its
a
wonderful
beer
to
drink
and
i
would
argue
possibly
better
than
brooklyn
lager
o
overall
a
pretty
nice
brown
ale
lots
of
malts
and
easy
to
drink
definitely
on
the
fruitier
side
of
brown
ales
worth
checking
out
on
the
palate
there
is
a
very
pleasant
bready
nuttiness
but
a
snap
that
keeps
it
from
being
heavy
very
mild
bitterness
smooth
and
drinkable
shows
excellent
balance
well
made
i
am
hoping
to
try
more
from
this
local
brewery
first
sip
is
nicely
malty
with
a
faint
hint
of
fruity
flavor
from
the
yeast
malt
dominates
and
the
beer
finishes
clean
with
no
harsh
flavors
overall
a
vey
nice
beer
i
would
certainly
get
this
again
o
delicious
when
fresh
note
ive
had
this
a
second
time
where
the
keg
was
pastprime
and
unfortunately
the
beer
doesnt
hold
up
to
age
at
all
mouthfeel
is
light
smooth
and
almost
slick
with
almost
no
carbonation
a
medium
and
flow
thats
smooth
and
watery
a
really
nice
brown
lager
thats
highly
drinkable
and
easy
to
put
down
light
enough
and
tasty
enough
to
be
a
session
beer
if
this
taste
suits
you
kelso
nut
brown
lager
looks
darker
than
your
usual
lager
it
fills
the
pint
glass
with
a
glossy
shoe
polish
brown
color
with
not
much
of
a
cap
up
top
no
stickage
smell
is
rather
fruity
with
some
nutty
appeal
and
a
apparent
roast
going
on
taste
is
pleasant
enough
for
the
style
i
do
get
some
dark
fruit
and
i
dont
know
why
feel
is
medium
and
a
bit
watery
the
lack
of
carb
detrs
me
from
drinking
alot
of
it
d
the
beer
goes
down
very
easily
and
i
wouldnt
have
a
problem
drinking
this

had
a
pint
at
sweet
afton
for
6
i
tried
this
once
before
and
i
feel
about
the
same
this
is
a
great
sessionable
lager
the
flavor
is
a
touch
light
but
there
are
sharp
toffee
notes
a
smoother
nutty
taste
and
then
a
mild
caramel
background
id
be
happy
to
have
a
few
pints
of
this
lager
any
time
check
it
out
next
time
youre
in
the
city
poured
nicely
into
a
shaker
pint
with
a
frothy
cascading
head
that
dissipated
to
a
thin
lingering
film
on
top
of
a
brown
hazy
unfiltered
looking
body
smells
very
doughy
yeasty
malty
taste
is
great
with
a
very
strong
malt
profile
a
good
yeast
taste
and
a
very
slight
hopbitterness
in
the
back
velvety
texture
mediumfull
body
and
light
carbonation
make
this
a
great
pleasure
to
drink
my
first
beer
from
kelso
and
certainly
not
my
last
nothing
too
exceptional
about
it
the
taste
was
very
thin
to
me
some
malt
up
front
and
then
nothing
i
dont
know
much
about
the
dark
lager
style
and
my
palate
might
be
more
accustomed
to
ales
recently
drinks
really
easily
though
with
the
right
amount
of
carbonation
and
mouthfeel
to
take
down
four
or
five
without
much
trouble
if
thats
what
youre
looking
for
good
balance
between
hops
and
sweet
verging
on
a
brown
ale
though
there
are
better
examples
of
the
style
overall
nice
to
try
this
out
but
not
the
greatest
example
of
the
style
not
sure
how
this
is
a
euro
dark
lager
imo
anyway
decent
brew
slight
bitterness
great
robust
flavor
carbonated
with
malt
in
the
back
of
the
throat
dvery
high
especially
given
the
abv
packed
with
flavor
for
a
session
beer
an
interesting
good
if
not
great
beer
id
call
it
a
hangyourhaton
kind
of
beer
one
growler
down
before
the
third
string
quarterback
got
thrown
to
the
dogs
id
call
that
drinkable
its
pretty
nice
to
be
able
to
take
this
one
home
medium
body
but
a
crisp
finish
for
the
lager
style
its
something
they
do
with
the
hops
its
very
drinkable
one
of
my
standard
choices
at
local
bars
found
on
tap
at
67buger
in
fort
green
brooklyn
pours
a
nice
chocolate
copper
color
with
about
one
finger
worth
of
fluffy
white
head
smells
of
toasty
malt
and
subtle
hops
taste
is
a
strong
caramel
malt
and
brown
sugar
up
front
followed
by
a
nice
solid
hop
flavor
and
bitterness
nice
toasted
barley
character
in
there
too
mouthfeel
is
a
bit
off
its
nice
at
first
but
then
thins
out
in
the
middle
of
the
sip
and
then
picks
up
again
at
the
back
of
the
palate
not
bad
it
went
great
with
my
blue
cheese
and
bacon
burger
and
sweet
potato
fries
very
drinkable
to
boot
with
enough
flavor
and
character
to
keep
me
interested
poured
out
a
dark
copper
brown
color
with
a
big
uneven
off
white
head
nice
lacing
the
nose
offered
a
good
malty
spine
surrounded
by
mild
spice
and
a
hint
of
wood
the
taste
countered
with
some
hop
action
but
balanced
nicely
by
the
sweet
malt
mild
spicing
adds
good
character
to
the
beer
crisp
mouthfeel
and
a
clean
finish
this
beer
has
sessioning
written
all
over
it
overall
a
nice
drinkable
lager
certainly
a
solid
session
beer
o
another
euro
dark
lager
par
for
the
course
if
not
a
notch
below
drinkability
suffers
as
the
body
is
rife
with
residuals
to
the
point
of
being
sticky
nothing
here
that
warrants
a
second
look
quite
decent
considering
it
is
an
adjunct
lager
plain
but
tasty
with
high
drinkability
semiroasted
grain
with
a
sweet
astringency
of
nickel
corn
syrup
and
light
cocoa
not
terrible
easy
kickback
beer
drinks
light
with
a
rough
carbrush
finish
husky
grains
accentuate
that
coarseness
not
a
bad
choice
o
needs
to
be
revisited
with
a
sample
that
is
definitively
fresh
reason
1345
for
a
trip
to
spain
a
definite
step
up
from
the
other
alhambra
beers
ive
tried
there
was
a
great
balance
to
the
beer
and
the
roasted
malts
are
complimented
beautifully
by
the
sweetness
and
the
touches
of
chocolate
really
a
solid
dark
lager
great
taste
and
smell
with
that
lager
lightness

it

this
is
a

very
drinkable
with

alcohol
ive
never
seen
this
on
a
store
shelf
so
if
youre
in
the

area
stop
in
and
give
it
a
try
just
a
2

so
a
convenient
stop
for
a

almost
goes

however
its
a

really
made
for
a

go
along

some
really
good
tapas
during

chicago
bottle

south
american
restaurant

pours
an
almost

with

much
the

roasted

taste
and
a
sweet

presence
a
very
slight
roast
bitterness
on
the
tongue
after
each

that
quickly
fades
a
good

overall
this
is
a
pretty
good
beer
that
is
very
easy
drinking
finishes
with
a
light
dry
roasted
aftertaste
this
beer
to
me
was
a
bit
surprising
i
picked
up
a
bottle
years
ago
at
my
local
shop
and
gave
it
a
try
it
poured
out
as
a
deep
brown
color
the
head
was
pretty
good
looking
and
tan
in
color
the
smell
of
the
beer
has
some
aromas
of
sweet
roasted
nuts
and
some
burnt
caramel
the
taste
was
a
little
sweet
upfront
and
slowly
faded
into
a
more
bitter
toasted
aftertaste
the
mouthfeel
was
a
little
watery
but
still
had
enough
body
to
hold
my
interest
overall
i
found
this
beer
to
be
much
better
than
i
expected
it
to
be
mediumlight
body
its
just
like
a
premium
version
of
an
industrial
beer
d
meh
i
dont
think
i
will
need
to
get
this
again
definitely
a
little
thin
and
odd
ball
poured
a
dark
brown
in
color
with
brown
highlights
that
had
a
thinhead
and
left
almost
no
lacing
sticking
to
the
glass
the
aroma
had
toffee
roastiness
upfront
with
coffee
bean
and
faint
vanilla
notes
the
toffee
was
more
potent
on
the
palate
with
nutty
caramel
malts
and
vanilla
accents
the
brew
was
light
in
body
with
a
fair
amount
of
carbonation
which
had
a
sweet
malty
nutty
and
crisp
finish
it
drank
good
and
was
surprisingly
good
coming
from
spain
drinkability
after
a
few
moments
of
deliberation
i
cannot
think
of
any
reason
to
go
out
and
buy
this
any
bar
or
store
that
has
this
will
have
better
beers
available
drinkability
really
quite
uninteresting
dont
think
id
buy
it
again
drinkability
this
is
a
very
quaffable
approachable
lager
dark
in
color
but
light
in
intensity
the
subtle
complexities
make
up
for
its
lack
of
boldness
good
stuff
d
easy
going
down
im
not
sure
i
would
qualify
this
as
a
session
brew
it
has
some
strange
aromas
going
on
which
is
welcomed
sometimes
i
would
recommend
it
if
you
come
across
it
glad
i
tried
it
my
first
iberian
brew
it
pours
a
translucent
garnet
nearly
clear
when
light
is
added
with
nice
black
highlights
as
though
klaus
jansen
inked
it
topped
by
over
a
finger
of
fluffy
ecru
foam
the
nose
comprises
dark
wheat
that
awesome
soapy
smell
that
seems
to
hang
around
all
sorts
o
brews
and
the
slimmest
possible
slice
o
chocolate
the
taste
holds
notes
of
light
chocolate
even
lighter
coffee
dark
wheat
and
a
hint
of
hoppy
florals
and
greenery
the
body
is
a
heavy
light
with
light
carbonation
and
a
fairly
dry
finish
not
bad
for
a
euro
dark
if
i
needed
a
fairly
inexpensive
darker
lighter
brew
i
might
definitely
lean
this
bottles
way
comments
this
beer
was
featured
in
one
of
my
beer
of
the
month
clubs
this
is
an
interesting
and
solid
entry
in
the
euro
dark
lager
style
overall
a
standard
dark
lager
didnt
suck
but
didnt
impress
either
if
in
spain
or
spanish
themed
restaurant
and
faced
with
limited
choices
i
could
have
another
but
outside
of
that
i
wouldnt
have
another
nn
d
super
nice
drinkability
i
was
able
to
pair
many
very
excellent
dishes
with
it
and
the
best
being
some
simple
roasted
almonds
go
figure
d
overall
this
is
a
decent
beer
definitely
not
the
first
beer
id
grab
but
if
given
to
me
id
still
drink
it
if
euro
lagers
are
your
thing
its
worth
a
shot
d
could
definitely
drink
a
few
of
these
with
a
meal
would
love
to
see
this
offered
at
mexican
restaurants
would
be
good
on
a
hot
summer
day
too
overall
this
is
a
good
dark
lager
that
i
would
reccomend
to
others
particularly
since
you
dont
often
get
a
chance
to
sample
a
quality
spanish
beer
poured
a
dark
cola
brown
into
a
tulip
glass
nice
foamy
off
white
head
that
does
not
last
long
some
lacing
remained
after
the
head
dissipated
aroma
was
not
strong
a
earthy
dark
fruit
smell
tasted
some
malt
maybe
a
little
fig
or
raisin
the
beer
was
thin
not
much
body
body
which
you
would
expect
with
this
type
of
beer
was
drinkable
and
i
would
drink
again
however
i
would
not
go
out
of
my
way
to
obtain
one
corn
and
other
grain
flavors
appear
up
front
but
luckily
soon
afterward
the
roast
and
smoke
flavors
kick
in
helping
you
forget
the
lackluster
beginning
to
this
highly
sessionable
light
bodied
brew
the
finish
is
pleasant
very
dry
with
no
lingering
bitterness
very
clean
not
bad
in
small
doses
but
that
aftertaste
shows
up
just
builds
which
hurt
my
overall
enjoyment
of
it
this
is
a
very
enjoyable
brew
d
very
drinkable
quenching
substantive
and
pairable
this
is
mass
brewing
at
its
finest
pretty
drinkable
my
first
beer
of
the
style
so
i
dont
know
a
whole
lot
about
them
but
this
certainly
isnt
bad
its
just
not
great
ill
have
no
problem
finishing
these
but
theres
probably
better
out
there
average
stuff
from
southern
spain
the
body
was
what
youd
expect
from
a
lighter
lager
like
this
the
drinkability
was
also
typical
for
the
style
overall
a
pleasant
enough
beer
id
grab
another
one
from
the
deli
to
go
with
a
sandwich
buy
i
probably
wouldnt
seek
it
out
poured
from
a
brown
11
2
oz
bottle
has
a
black
color
with
a
small
head
smell
is
very
mild
some
malts
taste
is
of
malts
and
chocolate
finishing
a
tad
bitter
feels
medium
bodied
in
the
mouth
and
has
average
drinkability
overall
not
bad
but
nothing
special
about
this
beer
d
highly
drinkable
this
is
a
nice
schwarzbier
that
could
be
an
easy
session
beer
especially
with
spicy
latino
food
tamarind
d
a
real
nice
surprise
out
of
spain
which
has
been
giving
me
some
good
beers
lately
a
deep
dark
brown
color
body
with
a
short
lasting
light
tan
head
light
carbonation
aroma
of
licorice
brown
bread
faint
floral
hops
and
brown
sugar
flavor
of
toasted
malt
caramel
cereal
grain
light
chocolate
spicy
hops
and
a
hint
of
dark
fruit
light
body
thin
mouthfeel
with
a
hint
of
licorice
in
the
finish
drinkable
and
better
than
expected
but
nothing
special
maybe
a
bit
of
oxidation
in
this
one
after
a
long
trip
across
the
sea
and
maybe
some
considerable
shelf
time
md
the
mouthfeel
is
effervescent
with
any
bit
of
supposedly
refreshing
carbonation
broken
up
on
the
palate
and
disappearing
in
no
time
at
each
sip
this
is
a
artificially
fizzy
super
thinbodied
really
badmade
beer
that
has
almost
nothing
to
provide
apart
from
sugary
water
definitely
one
of
the
worst
ive
had
in
the
past
two
years
this
could
be
a
decent
dessert
beer
maybe
with
some
ice
cream
or
chocolate
mousse
the
fruit
flavors
would
go
well
with
that
on
its
own
though
or
with
a
meal
theres
just
not
much
exciting
about
this
beer
the
aroma
is
dark
fruit
and
toasted
malt
with
a
touch
of
paper
the
appearance
is
dark
brown
with
a
small
head
the
flavor
is
like
the
aroma
the
palate
is
thin
overall
its
not
bad
but
not
good
its
one
of
those
beers
where
you
can
feel
the
potential
but
the
brewer
wont
get
it
there
as
european
dark
lagers
go
alhambra
negra
isnt
bad
unfortunately
it
isnt
good
either
it
has
just
occured
to
me
that
this
is
what
budweiser
dark
should
ab
ever
decide
to
go
that
route
would
taste
like
bottom
line
dumbed
down
dark
beer
for
those
who
think
its
cool
to
be
seen
drinking
an
import
drinkability
not
so
bad
oh
wait
this
isnt
a
malta
from
a
bottle
pours
dark
brown
almost
black
but
clear
pale
with
a
small
almost
non
existent
head
smells
of
malts
and
corn
first
sip
is
malty
with
some
corn
with
a
not
much
hop
presence
finishes
well
nicely
bodied
not
typical
of
beers
from
latin
america
thin
body
with
not
much
going
for
it
other
then
the
fact
that
its
cold
and
wet
feels
slightly
watered
down
and
has
an
unnatural
processed
flavor
this
one
i
bet
tastes
great
on
vacation
in
spain
but
here
in
the
comfort
of
my
home
its
a
poor
showing
alhambra
negra
pours
a
dark
brown
with
a
tan
head
from
a
brown
twelve
ounce
bottle
the
aroma
is
a
touch
malty
and
a
bit
estery
the
flavor
pretty
much
reflects
that
too
no
real
hop
flavors
standout
tastes
kinda
like
a
macro
lager
no
real
off
flavors
but
not
compelling
in
any
way
d
this
beer
is
very
unique
for
me
i
think
a
sixer
is
just
what
the
dr
ordered
this
was
alright
but
seemed
a
bit
tiredold
could
be
better
at
the
source
not
a
style
that
please
me
to
begin
with
but
would
take
it
over
bmc
or
most
eurolagers
ive
had
d
this
beer
didnt
do
much
for
me
while
it
did
have
some
strong
points
it
didnt
measure
up
with
its
taste
the
mouth
is
slightly
above
pedestrian
easy
enough
to
drink
and
went
well
with
the
grilled
octopus
curry
chicken
salad
olives
i
would
not
drink
this
beer
again
unless
i
were
presented
with
extremely
limited
options
d
tried
it
cold
didnt
like
it
let
it
warm
liked
it
less
maybe
paired
with
the
right
dish
it
could
be
better
i
have
no
idea
how
old
this
is
but
based
on
the
carbination
i
imagine
its
within
expiration
ive
moved
past
my
days
of
being
a
beer
snob
like
i
had
any
rite
and
try
my
best
to
go
at
every
beer
i
try
with
an
open
mind
we
have
american
macrolagers
that
turn
their
nose
up
at
this
one
maybe
this
is
an
aquired
taste
the
adjuncts
in
this
beer
make
it
a
lower
quality
brew
i
got
this
in
my
beer
of
the
month
package
and
its
the
only
thing
that
has
disappointed
me
so
far
d
this
is
a
nice
clean
drinkable
lager
even
though
spanish
beer
might
be
viewed
as
a
novelty
beer
in
the
us
and
perhaps
north
america
this
beer
is
done
well
and
i
believe
it
is
suited
well
to
quite
a
wide
range
of
food
pairings
i
tried
this
with
north
africanstyle
marinated
fish
and
spicy
spanish
rice
and
it
was
quite
wonderful
this
may
be
one
of
the
more
interesting
beers
in
the
wineloving
country
of
spain
however
its
massappeal
style
is
not
my
style
it
is
different
from
the
ubiquitous
light
lagers
of
the
world
overall
not
offensive
but
weak
watery
beer
it
can
be
quite
refreshing
for
a
dark
lager
but
not
much
in
there
not
a
bad
beer
and
it
sure
is
a
nice
treat
to
try
a
european
beer
not
from
belgium
just
to
see
what
other
countries
are
doing
again
if
im
at
amada
i
might
order
it
again
but
i
just
cant
see
myself
buying
this
beer
outside
of
a
restaurant
pours
dark
brown
into
a
pint
glass
it
has
a
black
body
that
fades
towards
the
edges
of
the
glass
the
head
on
top
of
this
one
crackels
and
doesnt
retain
itself
too
well
it
has
a
well
balanced
taste
that
isnt
overly
sweet
and
has
some
roasted
charactersitcs
to
it
it
felt
a
little
stronger
than
the
listed
abv
but
still
quite
enjoyable
matched
nicely
with
my
bbq
beef
sandwich
guess
i
was
expecting
a
beer
more
similar
to
negra
modelo
i
am
a
bit
disapointed
instead
of
a
creamy
malty
vienna
lager
i
got
this
grainy
concoction
of
semiroastiness
and
raw
cereal
grain
not
that
this
session
was
a
disapointment
just
lacking
any
of
the
benifits
that
i
hoped
to
receive
the
beer
begins
with
a
moderately
brown
lightly
headed
medium
carbonated
brew
eerily
similar
to
an
amber
bock
but
more
robust
in
its
look
the
aromas
show
a
light
brown
ale
maltiness
but
soon
follows
with
a
lot
of
graininess
and
adjuncts
residual
sweetness
and
soulless
flavors
continue
the
part
malt
part
cereal
grain
character
with
hints
of
nuts
toast
and
grain
hulls
nearly
thin
in
the
body
with
an
emphasis
on
an
oversparge
astringency
that
hurts
the
drinkability
finishes
quite
grainy
and
void
not
the
beer
that
i
was
hoping
for
at
all
not
the
greatest
beer
in
the
world
but
not
bad
its
generally
hard
to
find
negras
in
spain
and
im
not
sure
i
had
more
than
one
when
i
was
over
there
so
i
thought
id
try
this
here
in
the
states
poured
a
nice
dark
brown
almost
black
with
some
chestnut
highlights
thick
creamy
head
with
no
lacing
the
smell
consists
merely
of
a
light
sour
graininess
and
its
surprisingly
sharp
the
beers
worst
feature
happily
the
flavors
dont
taste
off
its
fairly
light
with
a
little
toasted
grain
and
smooth
relatively
thin
malts
clean
and
mostly
without
the
grainy
sourness
of
the
smell
light
to
medium
bodied
and
smooth
mouthfeel
a
hot
weather
beer
that
is
more
interesting
than
some
especially
other
spanish
brews
ive
had
d
a
very
sippable
beer
but
it
could
use
a
bit
more
flavor
to
make
it
stand
out
in
the
dark
lager
category
it
seems
like
more
could
be
done
to
distinguish
itself
especially
being
from
southern
spain
i
expected
some
form
of
regional
distinction
this
beer
was
actually
better
than
i
thought
it
would
be
poured
to
a
dark
brown
with
medium
tan
head
that
lasted
well
and
left
decent
lacing
aroma
was
a
little
faint
but
i
caught
a
combination
of
malty
dark
fruits
and
a
hint
of
licorice
flavor
was
a
semisweet
molasses
body
was
a
tad
on
the
thin
side
and
mouthfeel
was
a
little
tingly
all
this
led
to
a
finish
that
was
of
medium
duration
and
a
little
warming
i
tried
this
in
a
tapas
restaurant
and
was
not
expecting
this
one
at
all
for
a
beer
that
has
a
modest
abv
this
one
packs
a
punch
it
is
a
very
dark
thick
somewhat
syrupy
pour
the
head
is
okay
smell
is
good
but
not
great
the
taste
is
definitely
caramel
or
molasses
and
lots
of
it
not
a
strong
bite
some
hops
in
the
nose
but
more
malt
than
anything
else
its
a
good
beer
not
great
and
i
cant
say
that
it
particularly
went
well
with
the
tapas
i
ordered
but
it
was
a
surprise
for
a
spanish
beer
its
worth
a
try
lchaim
notes
ill
have
to
keep
my
eyes
open
for
this
in
the
future
judging
by
the
number
of
reviews
it
cant
be
all
that
common
would
love
to
see
this
in
some
mexicanspanish
style
restaurants
this
is
a
dark
black
beer
with
chocolate
milk
head
that
leaves
stripes
of
sandy
lacing
all
the
way
down
the
smell
is
delicious
milk
chocolate
tast
is
smooth
but
a
little
heavy
for
the
style
before
i
looked
it
up
i
thought
i
was
surely
drinking
porter
or
stout
definately
has
the
mouthfeel
of
stout
drank
it
down
no
problem
a
great
brew
recommended
an
entirely
unoffensive
beer
with
a
surprising
amount
of
flavor
worth
a
try
for
sure
id
buy
it
in
a
restraunt
that
is
lacking
in
good
beers
otherwise
i
dont
think
i
would
seek
it
out
solid
though
d
which
all
results
in
a
high
drinkability
very
surprised
and
impressed
fairly
drinkable
this
is
a
good
summer
time
substitute
when
youre
in
the
mood
for
a
porter
or
stout
but
its
too
hot
for
one
11
15
oz
33o
ml
yellowish
brown
bottle
with
the
alhambra
logo
embossed
around
the
neck
4
times
left
me
wanting
for
more
i
wanted
what
i
was
smelling
to
come
though
in
the
taste
it
just
needed
a
little
kick
still
the
experience
was
still
enjoyable
and
would
have
you
try
a
bottle
if
ever
given
the
opportunity
poured
a
deep
brown
color
with
moderate
tannish
puffy
head
smell
is
attractive
being
a
nice
roasted
malt
scent
taste
foloows
through
on
the
smell
with
a
toasty
flavor
mixed
with
hints
of
caramel
finished
on
the
sweet
side
with
only
a
mild
creaminess
very
easy
to
drink
but
not
anything
spectactular
my
first
beer
from
spain
d
this
is
okay
but
just
okay
its
unusual
in
taste
and
maybe
worth
a
try
if
you
can
get
a
single
just
to
say
you
did
over
all
nothing
impressive
about
this
beer
and
i
wont
go
out
of
my
way
to
try
it
again
drinkable
not
a
drain
pourer
but
why
bother
overall
the
taste
and
smell
is
very
similar
to
amber
bock
kinda
dissapointing
overall
just
an
average
but
refreshing
and
easy
drinking
beer
the
pour
is
a
dark
opaque
brownishreddish
with
a
tan
head
that
starts
out
small
but
lasts
until
the
end
of
the
glass
roasted
malts
dominate
the
mild
aroma
the
roasted
malt
flavor
has
a
sweetness
to
it
while
earthy
hops
give
this
beer
a
crisp
finish
the
taste
is
almost
medium
bodied
however
somebody
forgot
to
tell
this
to
the
slightly
watery
mouthfeel
this
beer
didnt
wow
me
but
i
enjoyed
it
much
more
then
i
thought
i
would
very
crisp
and
lagericious
i
would
say
that
this
beer
reminds
me
of
a
mix
between
a
schwarz
and
a
vienna
lager
it
was
good
and
drinkable
and
it
washed
the
rather
exotic
food
down
quite
well
recommended
for
the
apparantly
few
amount
of
bas
that
have
access
to
it
but
dont
expect
anything
particularly
mind
blowing
note
i
like
most
of
my
beers
on
the
warmer
side
but
this
one
really
needs
a
good
chilling
to
go
down
smooth
drink
straight
out
of
the
fridge
d
this
was
definitely
a
diamond
in
the
99
cent
bin
at
the
liquor
store
im
not
really
sure
it
fits
into
the
euro
dark
lager
style
cause
i
dont
really
drink
enough
of
them
to
know
it
has
good
balance
and
is
very
nice
to
quaft
i
think
i
will
have
to
try
some
other
brews
from
alhambra
if
i
can
find
them
is
it
possible
that
its
a
moorish
brewery
i
didnt
think
so
reviewed

overall
not
sure
how
i
feel
about
it
sometimes
i
like
the
flavors
sometimes
they
seem
off
as
i
click
review
i
like
it
that
could
change
by
the
end
of
the
glass
had
at
tasting
vintage
was
06
or
07
one
of
about
850
first
appearance
was
great
it

dark
as

50
ft
under
the
earth
with
a
finger
width
tan
to
cream
white
head
aroma
is
certainly
overloads
of
black
licorice
hints
of
cookie
dough
and
vanilla
taste
see
above
with
a
short
alcohol
burn
for
the
back
of
your
throat
very
cream
and
full
the
whole
way
through
my
advice
is
split
it
if
ya
have
it
it
does
have
a
level
of
sweetness
and
licorice
to
it
that
would
make
it
hard
to
finish
more
than
half
a
bomber
overall
a
homerun
especially
in
tasting
eviroment
i
have
to
admit
i
put
two
strikes
against
this
one
since
it
was
a
licorice
beer
however
interestingly
enough
there
seems
to
be
a
nice
minty
tone
to
this
from
the
licorice
and
thankfully
the
licorice
doesnt
overpower
things
at
all
what
you
get
is
a
nice
evenly
robust
lager
with
a
nice
little
flavor
ride
odd
as
it
seems
for
me
to
say
this
may
end
up
being
one
of
my
favorite
shorts
brews
o
im
pleasantly
surprised
ive
been
very
critical
of
shorts
to
date
of
the
beers
that
ive
had
from
them
to
this
point
ive
felt
theyve
been
forced
gimmicky
or
too
busy
and
discordant
this
beer
has
done
a
lot
to
restore
my
faith
in
them
it
is
delicious
and
perfectly
balanced
great
idea
even
better
execution
o
its
a
decent
beer
but
the
funky
end
is
really
off
putting
i
have
had
so
many
bad
experiences
with
shorts
beers
that
i
will
never
trade
for
any
of
their
stuff
again
i
guess
im
just
gonna
have
to
make
it
out
to
their
brew
pub
someday

is
fairly

very
nice
overall
balance
of
flavors
with
no
cloying
at
all
medium
carbonation
and
body
with
a
fairly
creamy
and
slick
mouthfeel
very
smooth
to
drink
at
8
alcohol
is
well
hidden
with
only
a
slight
warming
on
the
finish
overall
this
is
a
surprisingly
nice
and
interesting
black
lager
that
is
very
drinkable
and
balanced
d
very
drinkable
really
big
an
bold
flavors
but
they
come
together
really
nicely
and
taste
balanced
i
really
like
the
vanilla
been
and
anise
combination
bourbon
corn
and
then
i
was
getting
mostly
the
mint
here
the
concoction
tasted
off
yes
lactose
lager
secondary
black
coloured
body
some
chalky
taste
a
little
roasted
malt
whole
thing
does
not
carry
together
rather
ordinary
though
drinkable
stephens
bottle
from
a
previous
batch
tried
again
with
steves
bottle
and
much
better
soft
bodied
licorice
and
mint
better
drinkable
o
definitely
very
drinkable
and
delicious
a
nice
surprise
mo
bitter
up
front
a
bit
hot
maybe
this
is
partially
due
to
the
vanilla
bean
but
overall
drinks
smoothly
ill
bet
this
beer
is
really
something
when
fresh
and
while
odd
this
was
not
bad
at
all
even
at
a
ripe
old
age
of
3
interesting
offering
as
always
from
the
folks
at
shorts
certainly
not
your
typical
euro
dark
lager
but
i
like
what
theyve
done
here
flavors
working
well
with
one
another
o
wow
this
has
to
be
one
of
the
worst
beers
ive
had
the
misfortune
of
trying
as
of
recent
unbearably
heavy
on
the
anise
with
virtually
no
redeeming
quality
that
i
can
think
of
its
as
if
someone
took
a
subpar
dark
beer
and
thought
they
might
spice
it
up
a
bit
by
adding
mouthwash
to
it
it
simply
doesnt
work
on
so
many
levels
a
beguiling
brew
and
id
expect
nothing
less
from
shorts
im
a
big
fan
of
both
licorice
and
the
combination
of
chocolate
and
mint
and
i
found
this
very
interesting
though
likely
not
a
beer
ill
seek
out
again
another
interesting
idea
comes
up
short
too
watery
and
the
yeast
strain
doesnt
play
nice
with
the
initial
licorice
flavor
thanks
a
ton
dan
for
the
opportunity
to
try
this
hope
to
try
more
shorts
too
o
just
a
really
weird
funky
flavor
and
aroma
to
this
not
very
good
o
goes
down
ok
not
very
tasty
well
hidden
kick
interesting
represntation
of
style
i
wanted
to
like
this
beer
but
it
just
didnt
do
it
for
me
it
was
a
licorice
beer
it
was
licorice
with
beer
and
it
was
a
bit
much
this
beer
doesnt
work
for
me
my
big
caveat
though
is
that
i
dont
like
licorice
and
i
dont
like
the
way
it
combines
with
beer
adding
sharpness
and
bitterness
on
top
of
something
thats
already
bitter
and
sharp
doesnt
help
adding
black
licorice
to
a
rich
sweet
stout
might
work
but
here
it
just
accentuates
the
qualities
i
dont
like
the
acrid
and
thin
bitter
flavors
my
experience
with
this
beer
pretty
much
mirrored
the
one
that
i
had
with
it
on
draft
last
year
the
nose
really
delivering
the
promised
flavors
and
it
seemed
even
a
bit
more
here
in
the
bottle
but
the
flavor
while
still
good
just
didnt
bring
it
as
hard
this
is
still
a
really
tasty
and
unique
offering
from
shorts
though
and
id
definitely
recommend
checking
it
out
if
given
the
chance
very
unique
brew
glad
i
got
to
try
it
not
really
a
fan
of
licorice
though
a
really
cool
beer
to
be
able
to
try
this
lager
aged
quite
well
id
say
the
anise
is
strong
but
probably
at
the
highest
level
it
can
be
without
ruining
the
beer
i
had
assumed
the
flavor
would
be
overwhelmingly
of
black
licorice
but
happily
its
nicely
integrated
into
the
dark
lager
experience
dark
gummy
fruit
notes
make
an
appearance
too
suggesting
fig
and
sweet
prunes
slightly
hoppy
herbal
finish
with
a
kiss
of
mint
sharpness
mouthfeel
is
mediumthin
in
consistency
with
a
creamy
carbonation
and
smooth
body
another
absurd
yet
wellcrafted
beer
from
shorts
is
there
any
flavor
they
cant
capture
in
a
pint
hmm
a
very
odd
beer
yet
good
something
weird
happening
on
the
finish
like
a
balloon
swelling
on
the
tongue
very
minty
and
full
of
bitter
anise
light
vanilla
on
the
finish
and
again
the
mint
girl
scout
cookies
some
almost
bourbon
notes
but
more
like
a
canadian
whiskey
milk
chocolate
dark
bready
malts
and
more
a
oddly
interesting
brew
lighter
body
with
a
good
feel
from
the
carbonation
some
alcohol
is
felt
but
still
hidden
well
this
is
the
most
complex
dark
lager
i
have
had
certainly
unique
with
many
layers
well
done
and
this
is
from
someone
who
doesnt
like
black
licorice
much
o
this
is
a
very
well
done
experimental
beer
with
a
taste
of
anise
that
is
very
well
balanced
with
all
the
other
elements
it
does
not
become
over
powering
very
interesting
brew
o
a
complex
brew
but
it
just
wasnt
doing
it
for
me
not
quite
to
my
taste
but
seemed
to
be
well
crafted
well
call
it
average
o
not
a
bad
beer
the
anise
and
licorice
arent
so
overpowring
as
to
wreck
the
beer
like
often
seems
to
happen
here
good
effort
by
shorts
poured
into
a
snifter
this
is
a
nice
dark
brown
lager
a
couple
fingers
worth
of
a
tan
head
the
smell
is
very
strong
on
the
mint
but
i
also
get
hints
of
the
vanilla
and
anise
maybe
even
some
chocolate
it
is
a
really
interesting
smelling
beer
the
taste
is
a
little
heavier
on
the
anise
and
vanilla
then
it
finishes
with
a
nice
mint
and
chocolate
it
is
a
little
thinner
than
id
like
but
it
isnt
a
style
i
drink
very
often
overall
it
is
a
very
interesting
brew
from
shorts
id
drink
it
again
if
it
was
offered
maybe
even
pick
another
up
if
i
see
one
at
one
of
the
shops
i
go
to
as
someone
who
isnt
too
fond
of
licorice
flavor
i
was
surprised
with
how
subdued
shorts
made
the
anise
flavor
it
is
just
in
the
background
with
the
vanilla
adding
complexities
and
making
this
a
really
good
beer
bottle
this
beer
pours
a
dark
brown
with
very
little
transparency
and
small
beige
head
that
quickly
fades
to
a
thin
ring
around
the
edges
of
the
glass
the
aroma
consists
of
moderate
doses
of
licorice
with
light
coffee
vanilla
and
hints
of
mint
the
flavor
starts
with
a
quick
dose
of
black
licorice
and
is
slightly
bitter
and
dry
the
finish
has
moderate
dark
chocolate
roasted
coffee
and
a
touch
of
vanilla
it
leaves
behind
a
minty
chocolate
aftertaste
mediumbodied
with
moderate
carbonation
fuller
medium
body
slightly
higher
carbonation
attempts
to
be
creamy
but
some
prickly
feel
as
well
another
off
beat
and
interesting
beer
from
shorts
although
it
feels
like
theres
something
off
here
after
having
the
horrific
experience
of
having
the
pb
j
ale
by
shorts
i
was
kind
of
turned
off
by
the
company
but
i
am
so
glad
that
i
tried
this
this
is
one
of
the
best
beers
ive
had
in
a
long
time
i
didnt
find
the
anise
flavour
to
be
very
strong
to
me
it
tasted
more
like
mint
chocolate
chip
ice
cream
a
beautifully
crafted
beer
i
went
into
this
knowing
that
this
beer
would
not
be
my
cup
of
tea
so
i
kept
an
opened
mind
when
reviewing
it
is
tasty
and
flavorful
no
denying
that
but
i
think
the
mint
keeps
it
from
tasting
like
the
namesake

pours
black
with
a
nice
fluffy
khaki
head
when
held
up
to
the
light
you
can
see
its
actually
dark
brown
with
some
ruby
hue
active
carbonation
but
the
bubbles
are
very
small
wow
aroma
is
very
powerful
anise
chocolate
and
mint
are
prominent
im
having
trouble
detecting
the
vanilla
initially
there
is
a
mint
chocolate
chip
ice
cream
which
happens
to
be
my
favorite
thing
going
on
with
the
aroma
taste
is
sweet
with
a
nice
mix
of
anise
and
chocolate
mint
again
there
is
some
bitterness
but
its
mostly
roasty
rather
than
hoppy
medium
bodied
with
a
slick
texture
finish
is
smooth
and
seems
like
it
cleanses
the
palate
as
anise
and
chocolate
mint
tend
to
do
this
is
a
pretty
unique
beer
and
one
that
i
enjoyed
if
you
dont
like
anise
or
chocolate
mint
then
you
will
have
a
tough
time
with
this
another
interesting
beer
from
shorts
who
always
seems
to
stray
from
the
beaten
path
overall
while
the
quality
of
the
brew
is
evident
it
just
didnt
sit
well
on
my
palate
the
mint
and
anise
while
a
nice
combination
in
theory
end
up
working
against
one
another
here
again
others
may
find
this
better
than
i
do
mo
mouthfeel
is
a
nice
medium
body
that
has
a
slight
dry
feel
to
it
and
is
very
relaxing
and
enjoyable
to
drink
after
a
nice
meal
o
very
good
beer
i
would
definitely
like
to
have
it
again
considering
i
love
chocolate
mint
foods
etc
this
beer
was
a
very
good
drink
for
me
overall
solid
beer
and
i
would
certainly
love
to
have
this
again
i
doubt
i
would
want
more
than
a
12
oz
bottle
to
myself
in
one
sitting
but
certainly
an
enjoyable
beer
and
a
great
way
to
be
introduced
to
this
creative
and
innovative
brewery
d
i
am
intrigued
by
this
one
the
flavors
all
take
their
turn
and
meld
nicely
i
cant
say
its
something
i
would
drink
often
but
it
was
nice
to
try
3

the
body

topper

dissipates
quick
and
leaves
little
lace
shorts
has
created
an
interesting
beer
once
again
nose
is
of
mint
anise
and
vanilla
the
taste
follows
with
more
mint
and
chocolate
tasty
if
you
like
mint
medium
body
and
lowmedium
carbonation
very
smooth
and
extremely
drinkable
everyone
must
try
this
beer
not
everyone
will
like
this
beer
beer
is
mildly
sweet
with
a
nice
moderate
finish
the
anise
is
the
star
of
the
flavor
and
it
does
have
this
medicinal
quality
to
it
but
i
dont
hate
it
i
like
it
more
than
other
anise
beers
ive
had
and
id
even
have
it
again
o
this
beer
was
interesting
to
me
as
to
be
honest
i
didnt
think
i
would
like
it
the
flavors
were
very
well
blended
and
no
one
flavor
outshined
the
others
abv
is
a
little
high
but
it
never
really
shows
itself
while
drinking
this
beer
overall
another
great
beer
from
shorts
o
an
interesting
beer
from
shorts
as
usual
probably
not
something
i
would
buy
again
but
im
glad
i
tried
it
massive
thanks
goes
out
to
beeruser
for
sharing
this
one
with
funkydelic
and
i
at
an
impromptu
tasting
served
from
bottle
into
a
mikkeller
sampler
wine
glass
poured
a
deep
dark
brown
with
a
minimal
slightly
tan
offwhite
head
maintained
decent
lacing
throughout
the
glass
the
aroma
was
comprised
of
sweet
malt
fruit
smoke
and
licorice
the
flavor
was
of
sweet
malt
nutty
and
licorice
it
had
a
light
feel
on
the
palate
with
mild
carbonation
overall
this
was
a
decent
brew
nothing
on
this
one
really
made
me
want
to
drink
a
whole
lot
of
it
it
was
very
interesting
that
they
were
able
to
tie
the
licorice
into
this
beer
very
effectively
but
i
was
not
a
fan
of
the
flavors
that
came
along
with
it
worth
trying
for
any
licorice
fan
but
i
would
leave
it
at
that
i
really
enjoyed
this
a
well
executed
oneoff
that
didnt
disappoint
overall
i
thought
this
was
pretty
good
and
interesting
beer
i
have
to
admit
i
came
into
this
beer
thinking
i
probably
wouldnt
like
it
but
i
came
away
pretty
impressed
with
the
way
shorts
took
the
black
ale
base
and
infused
all
these
different
flavors
to
make
a
pretty
damn
tasty
brew
only
shorts
can
take
a
food
i
dont
like
and
model
a
beer
after
it
that
i
do
like
thats
some
serious
skill
this
beer
isnt
that
drinkable
i
think
one
is
enough
for
the
night
i
dont
think
i
would
buy
a
six
pack
of
it
but
i
would
pick
up
a
single
when
in
the
mood
if
you
like
black
licorice
or
those
mint
chocolate
cookie
then
you
should
give
this
brew
a
try
another
solid
and
unique
offering
from
shorts
overall
i
found
this
to
be
a
pretty
enjoyable
brew
given
that
i
am
not
a
huge
fan
of
licorice
i
think
that
the
anise
and
mint
pair
well
together
and
also
go
great
with
the
chocolaty
notes
i
am
not
sure
if
this
is
something
i
would
get
all
the
time
but
it
is
a
pretty
interesting
treat
if
i
am
in
the
mood
for
something
very
different
but
well
executed
overall
another
nice
idiosyncratic
brew
from
shorts
as
usual
another
extremely
interesting
beer
from
shorts
this
one
is
pours
dark
and
slightly
murky
but
with
a
head
that
sticks
around
very
nice
aroma
thats
heavy
on
chocolate
and
vanilla
and
lighter
on
anise
and
mint
the
beer
is
aged
on
chocolate
mint
leaves
anise
and
vanilla
beans
and
im
surprised
how
much
chocolate
comes
through
from
the
chocolate
mint
leaves
the
anise
is
almost
lost
on
the
nose
but
the
overall
effect
is
very
pleasant
with
a
light
snap
of
mint
right
at
the
end
the
taste
is
heavier
with
dark
licorice
notes
bitter
chocolate
roastiness
and
a
bitter
earthiness
there
are
some
vanilla
notes
throughout
and
some
mintiness
on
the
end
again
a
substantial
beer
and
perhaps
just
a
touch
harsher
than
it
should
be
but
so
very
interesting
d
i
dont
detect
the
madagascar
bourbon
vanilla
on
the
nose
or
tongue
a
unique
beer
interesting
enough
to
seek
out
more
shorts
d
overall
a
pretty
decent
beer
from
shorts
one
of
their
better
beers
that
ive
had
lots
of
sweet
licorice
in
the
taste
probably
couldnt
drink
more
than
one
of
these
personally
due
to
licorice
overload
but
nice
none
the
less
another
great
brew
from
the
shorts
crew
i
found
the
nose
very
inviting
and
the
bold
dark
sweet
flavors
mingled
well
on
my
palate
although
i
didnt
find
the
overall
flavor
to
taste
be
quite
like
black
licorice
this
did
not
deter
my
brain
from
enjoying
this
charming
flavorful
dark
brew
its
really
something
unique
to
my
mind
and
i
will
definitely
buy
this
again
to
savor
next
to
a
roaring
fire
during
this
cold
michigan
winter
season
this
is
an
unusual
mix
of
flavors
so
its
particular
to
the
drinker
but
theres
good
drinkability
to
it
abv
keeps
it
down
a
touch
as
well
drinkability
final
thoughts
this
beer
isnt
hard
to
drink
and
its
not
a
terrible
beer
but
some
things
about
it
were
a
little
offputting
to
me
when
i
see
such
a
dark
pour
with
light
carbonation
and
a
small
tan
head
and
smell
dark
chocolate
and
burnt
coffee
i
except
a
rather
full
chewy
mouthfeel
and
lots
of
bready
roasted
malt
character
however
this
beers
body
is
medium
at
strongest
and
there
isnt
nearly
the
strength
of
roasted
malt
flavor
one
might
expect
i
also
think
the
cooling
spice
flavors
would
work
better
if
they
were
held
up
against
a
thicker
body
and
breadier
flavors
as
it
stands
they
come
like
an
afterthought
in
an
otherwise
fairly
straightforward
and
not
particularly
exemplary
eurostyle
dark
lager
shorts
doesnt
entirely
miss
the
mark
but
theyve
brewed
much
better
pour
a
brown
with
a
bit
of
head
the
disappears
quickly
smells
strongly
of
licorice
but
not
too
overwhelmly
strong
tastes
a
bit
bitter
but
overall
fairly
smooth
a
lot
of
black
licorice
on
the
palette
but
well
balanced
with
the
rest
of
the
malt
profile
fairly
drinkable
for
a
bitter
herbal
beer
the
mouthfeel
is
medium
bodied
with
carbonation
being
below
average
drinkability
is
pretty
decent
and
better
then
i
expected
going
in
the
star
anise
was
a
little
strong
for
me
but
i
liked
how
the
chocolate
kicked
in
some
towards
the
finish
pretty
decent
beer
overall
drinkability
is
nice
this
is
pretty
nice
dark
lager
with
good
subtle
hints
of
black
licorice
poured
from
the
tap
a
deep
dark
brown
almost
black
with
ruby
hued
edges
and
a
short
khaki
head
aromas
of
black
licorice
mint
tarragon
and
simmering
cocoa
on
the
palate
this
one
was
fairly
crisp
medium
bodied
somewhat
medicinal
with
chocolatemint
licorice
and
roasted
malt
good
but
not
all
that
drinkable
drinkability
is
good
not
a
wow
beer
but
ill
enjoy
the
bottle
i
have
d
good
i
bought
it
again
so
i
could
rate
it
because
i
liked
it
so
much
i
may
not
buy
a
sixpack
but
id
definitely
order
a
second
pint
d
not
too
shabby
all
in
all
a
fine
and
very
creative
concoction
poured
from
bomber
into
snifter
liquid
is
a
dark
brown
with
a
small
mocha
head
that
quickly
fades
smell
is
lots
of
black
licorice
some
dark
malts
no
hops
at
all
taste
is
a
very
bitter
black
licorice
sugary
dark
malt
a
slightly
toasted
flavor
and
the
finish
is
more
black
licorice
mouthfeel
was
very
heavy
with
a
medium
carbonation
i
would
have
liked
this
one
to
be
a
little
cleaner
it
was
tough
finishing
this
one
i
give
shorts
credit
for
their
creativity
but
i
think
there
could
have
been
something
done
to
balance
out
some
of
the
strong
flavors
in
this
beer
medium
mouthfeel
and
medium
carbonation
d
one
is
enough
for
me
but
i
enjoyed
it
pours
near
black
with
a
thin
head
and
not
much
lacing
the
nose
is
quite
nice
with
a
good
dose
of
black
licorice
after
that
a
tad
bit
of
vanilla
and
light
molasses
taste
is
all
black
licorice
slightly
sweet
tastes
fairly
authentic
good
feel
with
a
nice
sweetness
and
good
carbonation
nice
feel
a
fairly
one
dimensional
brew
but
quite
good
and
spot
on
in
nailing
the
flavor
overall
a
very
solid
an
very
interesting
offering
i
could
see
myself
doing
this
one
on
a
whim
again
d
a
fun
and
unique
take
on
the
style
a
nice
idea
to
kick
up
the
flavor
a
notch
with
the
black
licorice
addition
smooth
and
creamy
a
successful
offering
from
shorts
the
pour
is
like
a
decently
formed
schwarts
beer
black
dark
brown
clear
with
an
off
white
head
of
about
two
fingers
nose
was
a
very
brisk
lager
apple
fruit
with
a
hint
of
molasses
and
a
lot
of
black
licorice
palate
was
a
savory
brew
of
a
tad
bit
of
tang
acidic
quality
of
leathery
malt
not
particularly
smokey
just
an
accent
to
the
digestive
aid
quality
of
the
beer
licorice
blends
fantastically
not
chocolatly
malt
but
on
the
fruit
plum
side
great
beer
great
brewery
fantastic
food
beer
broad
palate
range
with
a
jean
feel
drinkability
im
not
sure
what
a
euro
dark
lager
is
especially
since
there
is
no
description
on
this
site
however
i
will
say
it
does
not
blow
me
away
shorts
in
my
opinion
has
done
better
with
other
beers
this
is
decent
but
honestly
when
they
give
a
description
of
how
the
beer
should
taste
i
e
licorice
one
normally
cannot
deny
that
the
beer
indeed
does
taste
exactly
like
it
i
e
imperial
spruce
india
pilsner
holy
pine
trees
here
i
do
not
get
the
same
the
licorice
flavor
is
lackluster
though
it
is
noticeable
overall
not
a
bad
beer
but
short
pun
intended
of
what
i
expected
from
shorts
fun
to
try
and
one
of
the
most
unique
beers
ive
had
cant
see
myself
having
more
than
one
of
these
and
i
wouldnt
need
to
try
it
again
worth
trying
but
i
can
see
how
people
could
get
turned
off
by
this
one
dpretty
high
this
is
one
elegant
beer
im
gonna
get
another
one
of
these
as
soon
as
possible
d
i
cant
do
more
than
3
or
4
sips
of
this
i
dont
love
black
licorice
but
never
hated
it
this
is
just
a
bit
too
much
for
me
i
hope
this
never
touches
my
lips
again

d
another
tasty
and
innovative
beer
from
shorts
usually
you
wont
find
both
of
those
words
in
the
same
sentence
but
shorts
seems
to
do
it
like
clockwork
i
like
this
a
lot
as
it
is
but
if
it
were
a
bit
thicker
it
could
be
great
d
better
than
i
expected
reminded
me
of
thin
mints
or
licorice
cough
drops
like
fishermans
friend
i
had
a
couple
pours
of
this
one
and
i
may
seek
out
a
few
of
the
new
12oz
bottles
to
compare
i
have
found
other
lagers
that
i
really
like
this
one
i
love
i
could
drink
multiple
bottles
of
this
in
a
sitting
solid
beer
from
beginning
to
end
highly
recommended
great
beer
d
fairly
drinkable
its
helped
by
the
fact
that
shorts
did
not
go
overboard
on
the
licorice
there
are
many
other
flavors
going
on
with
this
that
keep
it
interesting
alcohol
is
well
hidden
and
its
easy
on
the
palate
pours
jet
black
with
a
nice
tan
head
in
the
aroma
vanilla
and
bourbon
like
notes
in
the
taste
bourbon
notes
vanilla
chocolate
and
a
small
minty
burn
a
smooth
and
light
bodied
mouthfeel
with
a
semi
dry
licorice
and
mint
aftertaste
nice
bourbon
like
flavor
minus
the
oak
and
kind
of
like
the
minty
chocolate
in
the
end
this
is
a
beer
worth
seeking
out
if
you
want
something
original
thanks
irishkyle21
for
sending
this
one
my
way
d
seems
to
have
a
lot
of
flavors
working
in
this
one
makes
you
want
to
keep
sipping
all
night
trying
to
pick
them
all
out
very
good
beer
all
around
though
would
love
a
few
of
these
this
winter
what
a
weird
brew
weird
but
good
i
dont
believe
i
need
another
any
time
soon
but
its
certainly
piqued
my
interest
to
see
what
other
bizarrities
this
brewery
has
cooked
up
dvery
interesting
beer
tons
of
licorice
everywhere
but
the
flavor
seems
to
meld
some
rich
chocolaty
malts
and
the
licorice
to
create
a
very
dessert
like
beer
that
hasnt
been
seen
before
d
another
interesting
one
by
shorts
i
think
this
one
would
have
been
better
a
year
or
so
ago
and
is
heading
downwards
i
enjoyed
it
but
others
at
the
tasting
didnt
like
it
so
much
try
at
your
own
risk
that
said
i
think
you
could
say
that
with
mostall
of
shorts
crazy
beers
tastes
great
sweet
licorice
molasses
a
warming
alcohol
that
leaves
me
wanting
more
great
beer
another
huge
thanks
to
sean
for
bringing
this
pours
a
dark
brown
with
a
super
light
tan
head
aroma
is
medium
lots
of
stuff
going
on
black
licorice
dominates
get
some
of
the
mint
on
the
back
taste
is
lighter
than
the
aroma
the
black
licorice
does
not
prenent
as
much
as
you
would
think
light
feel
for
sure
lager
totally
shows
very
drinkable
if
you
are
looking
for
something
different
buy
it
buy
it
regardless
you
wont
regret
it
overall
impression
an
odd
beer
cant
say
ive
ever
had
one
like
it
enjoyable
but
not
sure
id
seek
it
out
again
a
rare
one
and
glad
i
could
try
it
once
overall
another
very
unique
beer
from
shorts
some
unique
flavors
a
very
big
lager
that
i
wasnt
expecting
drinks
easy
however
md
i
could
pound
this
beer
so
at
8
percent
it
is
super
drinkable
also
super
creamy
and
smooth
feel
great
brew
d
the
ale
doesnt
feel
like
an
8
whopper
of
course
these
12
oz
bottles
could
be
lower
an
interesting
take
that
oculd
use
a
little
more
anise
overall
a
different
and
extremely
wellmade
beer
i
might
get
a
sixpack
for
the
cellar
another
unique
one
and
well
done
by
shorts
a
nice
change
of
pace
beer
this
goes
down
slower
than
a
standard
lager
a
nice
black
pour
with
a
light
tan
two
finger
head
leaving
some
spotty
lacing
medium
carbonation
aroma
of
black
licorice
vanilla
roast
and
a
hint
of
mint
leaves
flavor
is
much
the
same
as
the
aroma
roasty
wood
vanilla
chocolate
licorice
and
light
hops
lighty
bitter
short
finish
light
body
thin
feel
quite
drinkable
and
not
too
bad
cheers
to
you
shorts
you
really
know
how
to
make
them
this
is
certainly
one
of
those
beers
you
wish
was
yearround
even
with
the
oddball
ingredients
the
quest
to
obtain
this
beer
will
be
worth
it
3

cheers
d
its
a
definite
sipper
flavor
made
me
want
to
take
full
sips
but
the
abv
really
sneaks
up
on
you
about
halfway
through
the
bottle
the
complexities
of
this
beer
really
make
me
want
to
drink
it
again
to
try
to
figure
it
out
d
due
to
this
beer
being
a
lager
itis
very
smooth
and
clean
nice
to
have
a
few
glasses
but
may
become
a
little
much
i
treated
my
snifter
to
shorts
black
licorice
lager
which
had
a
dark
rich
brown
color
with
a
copper
red
outline
along
the
curves
of
the
glass
the
head
produced
was
minimal
with
a
heavy
straw
tinting
to
it
and
the
lacing
climbed
descended
and
clung
beautifully
as
i
swirled
the
beer
the
smell
came
across
strongly
of
roasted
malts
perhaps
roasted
chocolate
malt
with
nice
toasty
whiffs
and
pleasant
bits
of
sweetness
it
was
akin
to
a
slightly
overdone
cookie
upon
the
first
sip
i
was
struck
again
by
roasted
malts
this
time
coming
across
like
a
nice
toasty
biscuit
as
i
swallowed
i
was
hit
with
a
pop
of
the
star
anise
producing
a
drop
of
black
licorice
on
the
tongue
there
are
very
subdued
slight
suggestions
of
vanilla
and
a
refreshing
aftertaste
that
could
be
construed
as
mint
if
one
were
so
inclined
for
all
of
the
flavor
elements
involved
it
is
still
a
remarkably
smooth
beer
the
lager
wins
out
in
the
end
in
what
is
a
crisp
clean
and
well
made
affair
the
body
is
full
and
the
beer
finishes
slightly
dry
overall
this
is
a
perfect
showcasing
of
what
shorts
can
do
with
good
quality
ingredients
outside
of
barley
yeast
hops
this
whacky
combination
of
ingredients
really
makes
for
a
stunningly
flavorful
and
pallet
training
experience
id
love
to
pair
this
with
some
lamb
vindaloo
and
some
nan
bread
with
mango
chutney
this
beer
is
begging
for
a
daring
food
pairing
for
sure
although
its
doing
quite
fine
on
its
own
on
this
perfect
70f
latespring
night
d
shorts
certainly
nailed
the
flavor
it
is
also
very
easy
drinking
and
wouldnt
of
guessed
it
was
8
this
has
a
lot
of
flavor
and
you
should
definitely
try
it
i
wouldnt
really
like
to
session
this
one
but
very
tasty
a
nice
treat
with
a
meal
i
would
imagine
d
the
alcohol
is
well
hidden
but
it
does
catch
up
with
you
the
mint
aspect
is
a
bit
overdone
but
this
is
unique
tasty
and
well
worth
a
try
di
wanted
this
beer
to
give
me
more
than
it
did
i
was
looking
forward
to
this
but
came
away
somewhat
disappointed
based
on
my
apparently
lofty
expectations
this
is
pretty
off
the
wall
with
an
complex
mix
of
flavors
im
not
sure
if
it
really
tastes
like
black
licorice
but
it
does
taste
interesting
i
love
trying
shorts
beers
because
of
stuff
like
this
overall
i
like
it
i
dont
know
that
i
would
stock
the
fridge
with
it
though
dark
crimsonbrown
in
the
glass
excellent
clarity
and
head
retention
the
nose
is
a
melange
of
licorice
vanilla
and
root
beer
its
faintly
tarlike
chocolatey
minty
roasty
the
taste
is
similarly
odd
licorice
root
beer
green
tea
and
mint
at
the
forefront
with
a
subtle
vanilla
character
mediumlight
body
herbal
spicy
unique
black
licorice
finish
an
odd
beer
but
very
enjoyable
palate
is
mediumfull
and
fairly
smooth
with
somewhat
soft
carbonation
overall
this
beer
is
good
and
very
different
my
only
real
criticism
is
that
drinkability
is
not
terribly
high
d
good
damn
these
imperial
series
brews
are
so
good
and
so
unique
the
best
lager
to
ever
pass
my
lips
overall
this
is
a
wonderfully
crafted
and
very
sweet
dessert
beer
thats
not
fooling
around
when
it
comes
to
the
licorice
their
imperial
series
has
been
a
wonderfully
creative
mix
of
beers
and
this
is
definitely
one
of
my
favorites
an
outstanding
beer
very
smooth
and
medium
on
the
mouthfeel
enjoyable
and
well
done
poured
a
dark
brown
color
with
a
large
5
finger
sized
off
white
head
aromas
of
licorice
anise
roasty
vanilla
beans
and
chocolate
tastes
started
off
very
minty
with
licorice
chocolate
lighter
vanilla
herbal
and
anise
this
one
was
as
most
shorts
are
different
and
i
appreciate
a
brewer
trying
beers
like
this
d
drinkability
is
good
this
is
one
of
the
most
interesting
brews
ive
had
for
a
while
the
alcohol
content
is
fairly
high
but
does
not
hinder
the
beer
in
any
way
unfortunately
the
flavor
combination
really
does
not
work
that
well
for
me
still
not
a
bad
brew
though
as
it
warms
the
flavors
start
to
smooth
out
a
little
better
throughout
i
had
the
nagging
sensation
that
i
was
drinking
sour
milk
but
it
never
came
through
strong
enough
to
really
hamper
beer
overall
just
something
that
sits
in
the
back
of
the
mind
and
will
not
go
away
still
im
glad
i
got
the
chance
to
try
it
out
black
licorice
lager
is
an
extremely
interesting
and
unique
beer
i
truly
have
never
experienced
a
beer
quite
like
it
given
the
fact
that
i
hate
licorice
im
surprised
that
i
like
it
as
much
as
i
do
but
it
has
a
very
nice
flavor
and
really
impresses
i
cant
say
im
in
love
with
it
but
i
definitely
like
it
quite
a
bit
i
havent
had
much
experience
with
shorts
beer
but
i
am
very
impressed
with
what
ive
had
they
certainly
have
a
knack
for
blazing
unchartered
territory
this
venture
is
an
overall
success
recommended
if
you
can
find
a
bottle
thanks
to
hoppymeal
for
this
one
drinkability
this
is
by
far
the
tastiest
shorts
brew
ive
had
so
far
although
i
have
a
growler
of
cup
o
joe
in
the
fridge
expecting
good
things
its
pretty
damned
unique
and
not
some
crazy
ass
licorice
beer
like
the
name
implies
its
lightly
chocolaty
with
some
licorice
and
caramel
i
wish
the
mint
played
more
of
a
role
but
nonetheless
this
thing
is
tasty
big
thanks
again
to
jeff
for
his
generosity
from
the
other
shorts
beers
i
have
tried
im
not
sure
if
i
could
have
finished
a
whole
750ml
bottle
by
myself
maybe
their
imperial
black
cherry
porter
but
i
will
have
no
problem
finishing
and
savoring
this
bottle
thanks
to
hoppymeal
for
sending
this
as
an
extra
in
a
trade
a
while
back
roasted
malts
and
anise
spice
up
front
hints
at
being
a
licorice
bomb
but
luckily
more
flavors
quickly
blend
in
midpalate
dark
chocolate
hints
of
fruity
kenyan
coffee
tobacco
leather
and
some
very
ripe
plums
slightly
tangyspicy
edge
throughout
maybe
fennel
earthy
anise
and
licorice
root
also
stays
throughout
but
its
not
overbearing
reminds
me
of
root
beer
more
than
black
licorice
its
actually
pretty
tasty
as
it
lingers
in
the
long
finish
medium
body
with
a
somewhat
oily
feel
especially
in
the
finish
i
like
this
a
lot
another
great
brew
from
joe
short
mouthfeel
is
smooth
and
creamy
easy
drinking
somewhat
lighter
lager
body
quite
an
interesting
complex
brew
overall
a
good
one
to
share
with
its
strong
flavor
herbalspicy
profile
and
aftertaste
if
you
enjoy
black
licorice
you
need
to
seek
this
out
another
wonderful
experiment
by
shorts
drinkability
recommended
the
best
root
beer
ive
had
in
a
coons
age
yet
another
wonderful
creation
by
shorts
brewing
thanks
again
hoppymeal
d
split
the
bottle
with
some
fellow
bas
and
enjoyed
every
sip
the
light
mouthfeel
and
low
alcohol
makes
it
easy
to
drink
but
the
licorice
taste
could
be
a
little
much
after
a
750
of
this
so
goes
with
the
taste
very
well
balanced
soft
bourbon
anise
fennel
and
caramel
blend
nicely
presently
surprising
the
aniselicorice
is
not
the
main
focus
slight
medicinal
touches
easy
drinking
as
well
very
nice
brew
pours
black
with
a
small
light
coffee
and
cream
colored
head
that
slowly
recedes
to
a
ring
sediment
at
the
bottom
of
the
bottle
aroma
is
strong
of
anise
like
a
box
of
good
and
plentys
also
some
nice
cola
like
vanilla
aroma
that
blends
with
a
soft
mintiness
a
great
aroma
very
soft
and
yet
very
complex
taste
is
soft
vanilla
and
cola
up
front
that
quickly
blends
with
some
anise
which
dwells
on
the
palette
into
the
somewhat
astringent
and
slightly
roasted
aftertaste
mouthfeel
is
medium
definitely
some
malts
here
to
get
that
alcohol
up
there
but
still
crisp
and
clean
soft
carbonation
on
the
tongue
mid
taste
and
an
astringent
slightly
bitter
and
nicely
dry
finish
i
cant
get
enough
of
this
beer
for
its
alcohol
content
it
is
very
well
balanced
the
anise
and
vanilla
melded
very
well
together
and
the
lagering
allows
these
flavors
to
come
thru
better
without
fighting
other
yeast
flavors
outstanding
aroma
and
very
tastey
no
problem
with
the
full
750ml
if
you
like
black
licorice
seek
this
out
overall
the
thing
that
i
find
odd
on
this
is
there
is
not
even
a
hint
of
sweetness
from
the
malts
or
anything
else
i
am
not
into
sweet
but
couldnt
there
somehow
be
some
sweetness
here
and
particularly
malt
depth
to
this
beer
ill
pass
really
not
my
cup
of
tea
baby
o
average
at
best
just
was
not
a
pleasant
beer
to
drink
with
all
of
the
other
much
better
chocolate
beers
out
there
there
is
no
way
i
will
ever
buy
this
again
sorry
fellas
pours
a
deep
copper
color
with
a
stingy
white
head
minimal
retention
and
lace
smells
of
caramel
butterscotch
hersheys
chocolate
syrup
light
bit
of
roasted
grains
with
little
to
no
hop
presence
taste
is
sweet
with
chocolate
vanilla
caramel
hints
of
coffee
theres
barely
any
lupulin
to
be
found
in
this
brew
and
the
sweetness
builds
because
of
it
medium
body
and
carbonation
level
with
a
creamy
syrupy
mouthfeel
sweetness
aside
this
is
not
a
bad
brew
the
label
claims
they
use
cacao
nibs
in
this
i
was
thinking
it
taste
more
like
chocolate
extract
myself
ill
bet
this
would
be
good
over
ice
cream
definitely
worth
a
try
12oz
bottle
pours
a
light
brownish
amber
color
with
a
thin
layer
of
head
aroma
is
of
roasted
malts
chocolate
and
a
hint
of
burnt
coffee
taste
is
of
chocolate
toasted
marshmallows
vanilla
and
roasted
malts
a
bit
earthy
this
is
a
lighter
crisp
beer
that
strikes
a
good
balance
with
the
chocolate
flavor
a
lot
easier
to
drink
than
most
chocolate
beers
this
is
one
of
the
best
beers
of
the
winter
mix
12
pack
just
like
the
big
moose
ale
i
wouldnt
mind
seeing
this
in
its
own
six
pack
overall
an
interesting
beer
that
is
worth
having
again
for
certain
i
like
beer
i
like
hershey
syrup
they
arent
supposed
to
go
together
im
pretty
sure
that
a
chocolate
beer
could
work
but
it
doesnt
here
i
was
pretty
excited
to
try
this
from
my
favorite
brewery
poured
into
a
pint
glass
amber
color
with
a
creamy
one
finger
head
the
head
fell
apart
fairly
quickly
and
almost
no
lacing
smells
a
little
of
cocoa
more
of
a
coffee
smell
a
little
thin
on
my
tounge
tastes
of
a
mixture
of
chocolate
and
malt
but
neither
is
terribly
impressive
highly
carbonated
just
ok
i
guess
but
then
i
hold
saranac
to
a
high
standard
really
shocked
by
how
nice
this
one
was
really
a
stellar
example
of
the
style
and
one
of
the
better
beers
of
the
night
pours
black
with
a
1
finger
tan
head
with
a
light
chocolate
aroma
light
chocolate
and
roasted
malt
flavors
very
thin
mouth
feel
is
not
helped
by
the
higher
carbonation
overall
not
terrible
but
nothing
noteworthy
here
lacks
depth
and
balance
boring
yanked
from
a
saranac
mixed
pack
and
poured
into
my
standard
shaker
glass
this
lager
appears
a
clear
deep
crimson
brown
color
with
about
an
inch
of
fluffy
ecru
foam
smells
and
tastes
of
medium
roasted
grains
a
slight
touch
of
chocolate
malt
and
caramel
mild
grassy
hops
rather
thin
bodied
and
could
use
a
bit
more
carbonation
for
its
style
thanks
for
sharing
jay
thanks
jason
for
sharing
an
average
beer
with
chocolate
aroma
a
little
soapy
head
and
some
lace
on
a
clear
chocolate
body
a
below
average
mouthfeel
ike
a
chocolate
hershey
drink
lagerish
with
chocolate
an
some
sourness
in
the
finish
not
getting
roast
if
so
its
very
faint
its
a
very
interesting
brew
to
say
the
least
not
quite
what
i
was
expecting
but
its
pretty
refreshing
and
satisfying
not
bad
but
i
cant
help
myself
from
thinking
its
kind
of
like
a
bad
porter

its
o
k
but
not
really
worth
going
out
of
your
way
for
pours
a
chocolate
amber
what
a
surprise
smells
very
sweet
with
a
hint
of
chocolate
tastes
like
burnt
roasted
sweetness
with
barely
any
chocolate
taste
doesnt
taste
much
like
a
lager
not
horrible
but
i
wouldnt
seek
out
this
brew
this
would
be
a
good
beer
for
someone
that
hasnt
had
really
good
beer
as
it
is
fairly
light
but
has
some
interesting
flavors
a
little
interesting
but
definitely
not
too
offensive
for
the
casual
beer
drinker
a
darkish
brown
almost
black
body
with
a
tan
two
finger
head
that
stuck
around
for
awhile
a
light
roasted
malt
smell
with
maybe
a
hint
of
hops
a
decent
dry
roasted
malt
taste
mediumboided
and
creamy
very
light
chocolate
notes
and
a
rather
bland
syrupy
beer
not
too
bad
but
not
worth
seeking
out
only
a
slight
hint
of
chocolate
in
the
smell
and
in
the
taste
of
this
one
i
thought
it
had
way
too
thin
of
a
body
and
the
carbonation
was
not
apparent
enough
it
was
a
little
too
hard
to
enjoy
with
it
being
so
flat
on
the
plus
side
it
was
a
style
i
really
never
had
too
much
before
wasnt
too
bad
pricewise
and
was
somewhat
tasty
and
was
very
smooth
another
specialty
brew
from
saranac
it
pours
a
very
dark
brown
color
not
a
whole
lot
to
the
aroma
but
theres
a
faint
roasted
malt
scent
roasted
malty
flavor
coffee
and
a
little
bit
of
chocolate
the
flavors
are
a
bit
weak
but
this
was
pretty
nice
tmd
a
little
lacking
but
the
roasted
malts
and
chocolate
notes
are
there
a
bit
grainy
and
not
a
great
deal
follows
on
the
finish
which
is
a
little
disappointing
ultimately
ends
up
being
like
a
very
very
light
porter
though
the
body
is
about
the
same
as
one
in
some
ways
a
little
unusual
but
not
a
horrible
experience
that
strange
somewhat
metallic
flavour
the
saranac
flavour
that
ive
mentioned
in
other
reviews
of
these
products
is
there
in
some
way
and
i
fear
ill
never
understand
what
exactly
it
is
that
brings
that
out
overall
this
was
on
sale
for
46
pack
which
was
pretty
good
this
is
a
decent
chocolaty
lager
that
is
kind
of
like
a
porter
it
would
complement
a
steak
dinner
or
ribs
better
served
cold
d
the
flavors
are
weird
on
this
one
but
it
does
have
a
lot
of
flavor
with
low
abv
another
gift
to
beer
geeks
on
a
budget
it
has
a
dark
murky
brown
color
with
dark
red
highlights
the
head
is
tan
in
color
foamy
and
leaves
nice
lace
on
the
glass
there
is
a
dark
malty
aroma
with
a
heavy
toasted
flavor
there
are
some
chocolate
notes
as
well
as
some
mildly
bitter
hops
within
a
creamy
smooth
medium
bodied
palate
this
is
a
very
good
offering
from
the
saranac
family
of
beers
black
and
thick
with
a
super
fine
bubbled
tan
head
with
spotty
lacing
it
has
a
mild
wheat
aroma
with
decided
metallic
hints
the
flavor
is
coffee
and
delicate
chocolate
with
a
smokey
bite
at
the
back
i
sensed
a
little
metallic
taste
at
first
but
it
disappeared
very
drinkable
fairly
fizzy
it
disappointing
but
still
worth
the
try
i
wouldnt
mind
giving
it
another
shot
after
the
first
few
tastes
this
beer
seemed
drinkable
but
the
more
i
tried
the
less
i
wanted
to
continue
drinkability
a
solid
lager
in
the
ages
of
the
ale
this
beer
is
sessionable
and
delicious
perfect
for
any
chilly
night
one
of
matts
better
beers
d
okay
drinkability
i
guess
not
heavy
but
it
doesnt
leave
me
wanting
another
one
of
the
better
beers
in
the
saranac
variety

this
came
out
of
dark
brown
with
a
small
head

quality
chocolate

really

taste

crispness
once
again
i
didnt
get
the
chocolate
but
the
malt
was
still
very
nice
mouthfeel
is
rich
chewy
drinkability
is
good
smooth
light
crispness
i
bought
a
six
pack
of
this
based
on
the
name
alone
chocolate
amber
lager
sounds
really
appealing
i
wasnt
extremely
pleased
with
this
but
to
me
most
of
saranacs
beer
leave
me
with
the
same
feeling
d
fairly
decent
beer
probably
best
not
to
drink
more
than
one
or
two
one
is
enjoyable

more

one

i
dont
know
about
this
beer
its
inviting
with
chocolate
in
the
title
but
doesnt
live
up
to
it
maybe
i
say
this
after
having
sts
choklat
on
draft
a
few
nights
ago
this
beer
poured
a
very
dark
opaque
brown
with
a
twofinger
head
the
smell
is
mostly
roasty
malts
with
some
coffee
and
chocolate
notes
the
taste
is
mostly
roasted
malts
with
a
little
bit
of
bitter
chocolate
characteristic
with
an
emphasis
on
the
bitter
the
beer
has
a
decent
amount
of
carbonation
and
a
fairly
thick
mouthfeel
but
sits
a
little
heavy
for
me
to
consider
drinking
more
than
one
at
a
time
if
i
ever
even
grab
it
again
interesting
beer
to
try
but
its
definitely
not
going
to
make
it
into
my
regular
rotation
drinkability
notes
a
little
hard
to
put
down
due
to
the
husky
and
mildly
acrid
flavors
there
are
many
other
dark
lagers
that
are
worthy
of
my
palate
as
this
one
does
not
make
the
cut
as
far
as
my
taste
goes
d
eh
nothing
special
i
had
one
and
thats
enough
for
me
not
a
bad
beer
but
ive
had
better
munichs
poured
into
a
standard
pint
glass
color
was
dark
brown
almost
black
head
was
offwhite
and
dissipated
almost
immediately
into
little
more
than
a
thin
skim
scent
of
malt
and
chocolate
taste
similar
to
nose
mouthfeel
was
on
the
watery
side
with
a
little
effervescence
on
the
tongue
but
somewhat
of
a
chalky
finish
a
more
or
less
mediocre
brew
overall
i
feel
that
chocolate
amber
is
a
bit
overwhelming
and
complex
but
to
me
this
is
what
is
great
about
trying
beers
its
worth
a
try
by
all
means
d
quite
easy
a
drinkable
yet
flavorful
lager
d
its
goood
i
havent
said
that
on
saranac
beers
much
but
this
one
was
better
than
the
rest
and
would
warrant
a
repeat
visit
d
a
bit
too
much
acidity
and
unevenness
but
solid
overall
pours
like
a
porter
or
stout
basically
a
pitch
body
with
a
tan
head
and
a
malty
nose
very
sweet
first
taste
a
nice
roasted
malt
flavor
that
comes
of
citrusy
and
clean
mouthfeel
is
a
little
thick
for
a
lager
but
over
all
a
pretty
enjoyable
beverage
pours
black
with
amber
hues
at
the
edges
very
minimal
light
tan
head
smell
is
slightly
sweet
a
bit
roastychocolatey
with
some
light
hops
and
just
a
bit
of
astringent
alcohol
taste
is
fairly
complex
a
mix
of
sweet
malt
and
caramel
chocolate
and
roasty
malts
with
just
enough
hop
bitterness
to
balance
this
beer
out
mouthfeel
is
good
lightmedium
body
with
lowmoderate
carbonation
drinkability
is
quite
good
this
beer
is
fairly
light
in
terms
of
body
but
has
some
of
my
favorite
flavors
this
might
be
a
good
gateway
brew
for
people
who
dont
like
dark
beer
a
little
dry
in
the
feel
chalky
smoother
at
the
end
medium
bodied
feels
like
a
stout
first
then
an
amber
not
bad
but
not
amazing
feel
like
a
mixed
bag
drinkability
ok
not
a
great
munich
dunkel
it
might
make
a
decent
session
beer
from
some
this
one
is
somewhat
enjoyable
except
for
the
finish
i
like
the
flavors
it
presents
up
until
the
end
barely
recommended
had
this
in
their
sample
pack
i
was
a
bit
taken
aback
by
the
appearance
extremely
thick
darkness
we
are
talking
complete
brownblack
color
that
more
looks
thick
than
creamy
the
head
was
also
probably
the
darkest
foam
i
have
seen
in
awhile
its
smells
are
pretty
faint
for
what
i
expected
roasty
aromas
of
mainly
light
malts
and
caramel
but
really
no
chocolate
i
could
detect
the
taste
did
have
more
of
a
chocolate
taste
but
it
was
so
light
and
wrapped
around
some
coffeeish
flavors
that
it
really
minimized
that
flavor
mouthfeel
really
got
me
disappointed
the
drink
was
really
watery
and
lacked
any
punch
to
it
especially
with
those
flavors
way
too
carbonated
i
would
say
overall
it
is
approachable
and
accessible
since
it
lacked
any
overpowering
qualities
but
that
also
hinders
it
from
really
actualizing
some
potential
drinkability
an
ok
beer
imo
it
is
certainly
better
then
most
of
the
macros
in
terms
of
flavor
but
the
smell
and
slightly
bitter
taste
limit
it
pours
a
very
deep
brown
although
it
looks
more
like
its
from
the
chocolate
instead
of
being
a
dark
lager
decent
head
and
lacing
nice
chocolate
scent
but
not
very
much
else
for
a
lager
of
any
kind
i
would
say
its
weak
but
it
gives
the
chocolate
scent
as
promised
by
its
name
same
for
the
taste
its
almost
like
chocolate
milk
but
with
beer
not
much
to
taste
from
the
lager
side
as
its
covered
up
by
the
chocolate
then
again
if
you
dont
like
chocolate
style
beers
you
shouldnt
be
trying
this
one
it
goes
down
very
very
smoothly
it
would
be
easy
to
drink
a
few
of
these
if
you
like
the
flavor
although
too
many
and
it
will
sit
in
your
stomach
like
several
chocolate
milks
would
it
wont
be
a
problem
to
finish
these
off
but
id
prefer
a
hint
of
chocolate
flavor
instead
of
nothing
but
chocolate
flavor
2
from
the
sampler
was
this
one
pours
an
almost
black
ruddy
brown
w
a
thin
tan
head
which
dissipates
quickly
leaving
a
minimal
amount
of
lacing
too
dark
for
the
style
as
well
a
roasted
chocolate
malt
aroma
prevails
w
some
faint
fruity
datelike
alcoholic
undertone
a
rich
dry
chocolate
malt
and
roasted
malt
profile
balanced
w
hop
bitterness
do
make
it
reminiscent
of
bakers
chocolate
i
rather
enjoyed
this
one
more
like
a
stout
than
a
dunkel
w
some
yeasty
esters
a
dry
med
bodied
beer
nice
co2
level
makes
the
flavor
stick
around
a
while
definitely
a
drinkable
beer
hard
to
believe
its
a
5
8
abv
brew
i
wish
there
were
more
than
two
in
the
holiday
twelvepack
but
hopefully
the
others
will
live
up
to
this
one
overall
not
a
bad
beer
but
not
exceptional
easy
to
drink
with
a
decent
flavor
but
maybe
sometimes
you
need
a
beer
thats
not
over
the
top
popped
it
open
and
poured
it
into
a
nonic
a
rich
black
with
an
inch
of
cappuccino
foam
i
dont
quite
see
whats
so
amber
about
this
chocolate
brew
it
smelled
like
sweet
chocolate
with
hints
of
coffee
the
taste
was
sweet
yet
bitter
much
like
a
a
good
dark
chocolate
it
had
a
mild
carbonation
that
danced
on
the
tongue
a
decent
brew
but
definitely
one
to
have
for
dessert
with
a
block
of
dark
chocolate
certainly
not
a
session
beer
nice
dark
body
but
the
head
was
small
initially
and
disappeared
quickly
the
aroma
isnt
strong
but
there
is
a
burnt
smell
in
there
the
flavor
doesnt
stand
out
either
but
has
a
certain
saranac
quality
to
it
the
body
is
pretty
light
and
the
drinkability
isnt
great
i
would
assume
this
beer
aged
quite
well
i
cant
remember
drinking
it
5
years
ago
but
i
have
to
wonder
if
it
was
this
good
overall
another
somewhat
unimpressive
selection
from
saranac
it
doesnt
fail
as
a
winter
brew
however
as
it
is
sweet
and
warming
12
ounce
bottle
part
of
the
saranac
12
beers
of
winter
pack
served
in
a
sam
adams
bl
glass
the
beer
pours
very
dark
brown
with
an
inch
and
a
half
frothy
tan
head
head
retention
and
lacing
are
both
pretty
good
it
smells
like
chocolate
and
roasted
malt
not
much
else
to
it
taste
is
similar
to
the
aroma
with
a
bit
of
bitter
hops
in
the
finish
mouthfeel
is
medium
its
nice
and
smooth
with
moderate
carbonation
drinkability
is
good
too
overall
i
think
this
is
a
good
beer
i
could
drink
quite
a
few
of
these
at
a
time
it
could
use
a
little
more
chocolate
imo
but
its
still
good
not
a
bad
choice
at
all
this
is
a
unique
hybridish
brew
that
i
found
to
be
better
than
avaerge
for
this
brewery
and
not
at
all
hard
to
drink
pours
black
with
a
big
light
tan
head
lacing
on
surface
and
sides
mild
roasted
malt
aroma
with
some
chocolate
notes
mild
chocolate
malt
flavor
a
little
roasted
malt
bitterness
some
herbal
hops
are
present
in
the
finish
balanced
medium
bodied
and
smooth
quite
drinkable
solid
beer
overall
pours
a
black
color
with
an
ample
brown
head
aroma
is
smooth
and
malty
with
a
hint
of
chocolate
in
the
nose
taste
is
much
of
the
same
kind
of
sweet
on
the
tongue
with
the
lager
characteristics
shining
through
a
very
thin
layer
of
roastiness
very
drinkable
and
simple
a
good
start
for
the
style
the
chocolate
part
is
subtle
and
could
use
a
bit
more
oomph
d
not
being
a
chocolate
fan
this
isnt
too
terrible
i
definitely
liked
the
toasted
quality
whether
that
was
a
product
of
storing
for
the
last
6
months
or
not
saranac
chocolate
amber
is
a
strange
beast
that
in
my
opinion
is
best
thought
of
as
a
black
and
tan
in
looking
back
at
my
review
of
the
brewerys
actual
black
tan
which
i
consider
to
be
one
of
their
best
offerings
i
dont
see
a
whole
lot
of
difference
between
that
beer
and
this
one
sca
is
a
little
too
unrefined
to
be
a
star
but
is
a
reasonably
pleasant
brew
all
the
same
taste
isnt
all
that
chocolate
though
there
is
some
with
some
coffee
but
nothing
too
robust
very
easy
beer
to
drink
it
is
what
it
is
a
darker
lager
with
a
more
deep
taste
than
a
lager
might
have
but
nothing
super
layered
or
super
interesting
i
must
admit
im
almost
through
my
saranac
mixer
12
pack
saranac
puts
out
alot
of
good
products
few
really
wowed
me
but
they
make
an
above
bar
brew
time
and
again
at
an
affordable
price
note
price
did
not
affect
my
scores
if
so
they
would
be
higher
anyway
good
show
saranac
pours
a
dark
brown
with
ruby
highlights
and
a
three
finger
tan
head
that
held
well
and
a
fair
amount
of
lacing
weak
dark
chocolate
and
roasted
malt
aromas
taste
is
better
with
slightly
bitter
chocolate
mixing
with
the
roasted
malt
and
dark
caramel
mouthfeel
was
light
with
a
slight
after
taste
good
drinkable
beer
but
not
special
in
any
way
i
wish
my
friend
would
have
brought
back
another
sampler
pack
from
this
brewery
its
so
nice
that
there
are
12
different
beers
overall
it
was
not
at
all
what
i
would
have
expected
form
the
style
it
is
too
lite
and
watery
for
me
it
is
drinkable
but
i
would
rather
have
something
else
given
the
choice
drinkability
is
reasonably
good
though
im
ready
to
move
on
to
something
else
neither
the
worst
nor
the
best
of
the
12
pack
sampler
i
would
not
buy
this
on
its
own
poured
a
dark
murky
brown
with
a
quickly
vanishing
head
aromas
are
fleeting
coffee
slight
green
hops
some
roasted
malts
taste
is
not
much
different
first
a
sweetened
toffee
followed
by
burnt
black
coffee
almost
burning
and
acidic
with
raw
hop
bitterness
some
chocolate
malt
attempts
to
break
through
in
the
finish
but
is
held
back
by
the
ugly
coffee
and
burnt
malts
watery
finish
and
goes
down
easy
if
you
can
ignore
what
your
tastebuds
are
tellling
you
right
off
the
bat
i
could
only
get
it
to
prduce
a
very
thin
offwhite
head
that
had
little
retention
the
color
was
a
deep
dark
brown
with
ruby
highlights
the
nose
was
sweet
especially
with
a
cocoa
scent
mouthfeel
was
mediumtothick
with
a
light
chocolate
presence
in
the
mouth
the
finish
had
a
full
effervescent
feel
to
it
with
the
same
light
chocolatiness
continuing
the
drinkability
is
good
i
would
not
mind
trying
it
again
prosit
mk
oelergud
a
surprise
in
the
mixed
pack
would
work
well
as
a
pairing
for
smoked
mozzerrella
a
decent
offering
if
you
are
looking
for
something
with
a
range
of
flavors
worth
a
taste
urk
a
good
dark
session
lager
id
buy
it
again
d
its
ok
not
the
top
of
my
list
i
woudnt
buy
it
again
though
on
a
side
note
saranac
is
a
local
brewery
and
i
am
a
big
fan
they
are
great
with
the
community
and
do
a
lot
of
great
events
at
the
brewery
for
the
public

thursdays
if
you
ever
find
yourself
in
utica

looking
for
something
to
do

saranac
you
will
not
be
disappointed
poured
a
dark
brown
color
with
hints
of
amber
small
tan
head
that
dissipated
quickly
the
smell
was
kind
of
faint
for
a
style
that
uses
roasted
malts
the
lager
had
a
sweet
roasted
malt
flavor
though
not
very
chocolatey
with
a
bitter
hop
aftertaste
the
mouthfeel
was
moderate
with
decent
carbonation
nothing
special
about
this
lager
not
something
i
would
drink
many
of
the
taste
is
more
of
the
same
big
chocolate
sweet
malt
and
very
little
hop
presence
it
wasnt
overly
complex
but
it
did
the
job
mouthfeel
was
thin
which
is
ok
for
the
style
serviceably
drinkable
one
of
the
better
ones
out
of
the
saranac
winter
pack
got
this
in
the
saranac
12
beers
of
winter
sampler
poured
a
dark
chocolate
brown
and
had
a
nice
lasting
head
to
it
had
a
chocolate
malt
smell
it
had
a
rich
malty
flavor
dry
finish
and
medium
bitterness
reminded
me
of
a
porter
but
less
sweet
overall
this
was
a
very
enjoyable
dark
beer
cheers
drinkability
would
be
better
if
the
taste
was
up
to
par
appears

deep
ruby

coming
through

nice
but
kinda
porterish
to
me
also
has
a
clean
roasty
mild
fruity
note
its
just
solid
mouthfeel
is
medium
bodied
even
carbonation
silky
feel
to
it
on
the
palate
drinkability
is
outstanding
stuff
more
like
a
porter
than
a
chocolate
amber
although
i
havent
had
many
to
compare
it
to
i
wouldnt
mind
seeing
this
one
year
round
major
flavors
include
chocolate
and
cocoa
with
a
crazy
smoothness
very
creamy
and
light
while
keeping
a
respectable
chocolate
malt
flavor
i
enjoyed
this
one
i
was
pretty
suprised
with
this
not
as
upfront
with
the
chocolate
as
i
would
have
liked
but
decent
enough
a
testament
to
this
beer
though
is
the
drinkability
this
beer
went
down
ultra
smooth
poured
more
of
a
brown
amber
than
a
black
very
little
nose
taste
is
smooth
and
okay
dont
know
how
it
would
stand
up
to
brooklyn
brewerys
offering
but
not
many
in
this
style
do
poured
12
oz
bottle
into
a
glass
mug
nice
rich
dark
amber
color
with
thin
tan
head
that
dissipates
quickly
into
a
ring
a
malty
fruity
chocolaty
smell
that
permeates
your
nostrils
quite
nicely
a
roasted
chocolate
taste
with
a
bitter
aftertaste
interesting
salty
remnants
left
on
your
lips
after
each
sip
a
pretty
good
mouthfeel
a
good
beer
to
drink
during
the
winter
good
if
youre
into
chocolate
beer
this
12
oz
bottle
was
from
a
2006
beers
of
winter
variety
pack
none
of
the
saranac
beers
in
this
box
has
any
freshness
dating
pours
clear
ruby
almond
with
a
nice
looking
tiny
bubble
head
film
and
then
wispy
lacing
nose
is
of
dark
chocolate
and
sweet
malts
this
is
a
sugary
sweet
ale
chocolate
and
cocoa
quite
present
in
the
flavor
profile
perhaps
with
dessert
not
my
cup
of
tea
pours
black
with
red
hues
with
a
dark
tan
head
that
fades
quickly
smell
is
mostly
malt
with
hops
and
chocolate
characters
the
taste
is
similar
to
other
saranac
beers
with
the
exception
of
the
chocolate
which
is
somewhat
low
key
compared
to
other
chocolate
brews
this
one
is
much
more
subtle
the
chocolate
comes
through
more
in
the
aftertaste
the
mouthfeel
is
ok
a
small
hop
bite
if
you
are
a
saranac
fan
this
is
an
easy
drinker
with
a
subtle
twist
this
is
a
good
brew
and
worth
checking
out
pretty
cool
little
beer
if
i
do
say
so
myself
worth
a
try
md
a
well
blended
and
well
balanced
flavor
and
an
easy
down
beer
even
the
girlfriend
didnt
mind
it
i
very
much
like
this
beer
well
done
matts

dark
brown
color
with

thick
head
with

good
retention
and
lacing
poured
from
a
bottle
into
a
pilsner
glass
the
smell
it
has
isnt
quite
as
strong
as
i
would
have
expected

very
malty

has
a
strong
chocolatey
coffee
taste
to
it
feels
fairly
light
in
the
mouth
and
has
a
lot
of
carbonation
overall
a
decent
beer
but
nothing
too
special
overall
a
very
tasty
lager
easy
to
drink
and
rather
robust
d
i
see
myself
having
a
bottle
or
two
before
the
flavors
overwhelm
my
palate
drinkability
not
that
impressive
as
this
is
thin
and
just
plain
dull
not
one
of
the
highlights
of
this
mixed
2
pack
the
best
part
of
this
beer
is
the
way
it
looks
i
poured
from
a
12
ounze
bottle
into
a
pint
glass
one
of
these
days
im
either
going
to
stop
buying
12
ounze
beers
or
start
buying
12
ounze
glasses
it
poured
a
nice
color
with
a
good
head
the
retention
was
fair
and
so
was
the
lace
but
not
very
sticky
there
wasnt
much
of
chocolate
taste
or
smell
for
the
most
part
it
was
an
average
beer
dont
drink
and
review
d
im
moving
straight
to
the
subjective
here
i
didnt
really
enjoy
this
largely
because
the
toasted
aspect
came
off
as
burned
which
wasnt
inviting
at
all
the
next
time
i
try
this
there
is
always
a
next
time
a
more
dominant
wheat
taste
to
it
but
not
one
i
would
seek
out

think
that
this
was
one
of
the
better
beers
from
the
winter
12
pack

and
easy
to

a
little
on

side

and
some
nice
big
lacing
as
well
taste
is
a
decently
strong
sweet
malt
overlaid
with
a
cocoa
powder
kind
of
chocolate
taste
is
a
nice
malty
taste
which
i
guess
is
the
idea

i
cant

5the
best
part
of
this
brew
was
the
nice
dark
body
and
the
thick
foamy
head
the
head
did
die
out
though

5brew
was
poured
to
a
dark
brown
color
with
a
fair
sized
head
that
seems
to
have
pretty
good
retention
as
it
leaves
lace
rings
down
the
side
of
the
glass
the
aroma
seems
to
be
of
chocolate
with
what
seems
to
be
a
smoked
malt
scent
not
an
overly
aromatic
brew
but
what
was
there
was
ok
the
flavors
are
very
malty
first
off
it
is
just
simply
chocolate
maybe
a
small
bit
of
coffee
quite
unlike
most
amber
ive
had
but
i
just
dont
feel
the
chocolate
flavor
contributes
to
this
beer
perhaps
a
floral
or
fruity
aftertaste
the
aftertaste
is
slightly
bitter
and
dry
mouthfeel
is
more
light
than
heavy
this
is
ok
but
only
because
there
isnt
much
flavor
to
turn
you
off
with
blitz134jan
25
and
toffee
rather
simple
flavor
malt
is
onedimensional
caramel
and
only
subtly
so
not
as
chocolatey
as
expected
nondescript
hop
flavor
is
quite
prominent
thin
but
very
smooth
reminiscent
of
nitro
an
average
beer

which
does
present
some
more

characteristics
than
the

just
the
tiniest
bit
of
fruitiness
with
a
caramel
twist
and
hints
of
cocoa
i
can
imagine
some
folks
finding
this
a
bit
annoying
i
couldnt
give
it
any
higher
because
i
am
not
sure
i
like
having
the
aftertaste
linger
as
long
as
this
one
does

hits

hmmm
yet
its

to
remain
an

lager
the
flavor
has
qualities
of
dark
roast

definitely
one
to
be
on
