perfectly
clean
overall

really
light
and
easy
to
drink
nothing
special
and
the
flavors
are
very
light
its
fine
for
a
summertime
beer
to
pound
away
at
but
nothing
id
take
over
a
lot
of
other
summertime
beers
poured
into
a
sam
adams
glass
developed
a
nice
bubbly
white
head
with
some
retention
and
minimal
lacing
aroma
had
notes
of
yeast
and
grain
appearance
was
a
golden
straw
with
some
clouding
tasted
light
with
mild
grain
and
grass
notes
some
hoppy
bite
on
the
back
mouthfeel
was
light
with
a
mild
and
clean
aftertaste

sly

golden
lager
is
a
stellar
lager
with
just
the
right
mix
of
pilsner
and
munich
graininess
with
noble
hopping
they
have
made
an
outstanding
brew
here
overall
just
got
home
from
the
gym
and
this
beer
quenched
my
thirst
just
moved
on
to
the
second
can
next
time
through

there
will
be
a
it
stop
in
pottstown
overall
a
nice
and
clean
sessionable
lager
not
the
most
complex
beer
but
a
good
one
i
have
had
better
in
the
style
but
would
not
turn
this
down
this
is
an
awesome
basic
beer
when
you
just
want
a
straight
up
beer
highly
drinkable
also
really
dug
the
open
top
cans
good
job
sly
fox
not
a
dud
but
below
par
for
sf
it
has
a
sweet
pils
malt
aftertaste
and
bitterness
up
front
of
tettnanger
but
if
it
were
sold
in
germany
itd
be
on
par
with
oettinger
a
really
cheap
beer
sold
in
germany
and
usually
seen
in
the
hands
of
street
people
and
thats
not
good
o
this
is
a
pretty
good
beer
i
enjoy
the
straw
flavor
which
tastes
fresh
and
rich
unlike
many
other
golden
lagers
of
america
with
their
stale
pissy
flavors
appears
crystal
clear
golden

decent
if
not
better
than
decent
a

of

ilk
no
problem
to
polish
off
three
or
four
in
a
single
session
havent
tried
drinking
from
the
can
yet
yet
being
the
operative
word
here
overall
another
great
beer
from
sly
fox
but
i
have
had
better
reps
of
the
style
goes
down
easy
though
with
session
able
qualities
i
started
the
crack
and
the
whole
top
came
off
in
my
hand
aaaaahhh
i
can
see
into
the
can
itself
this
is
not
how
the
canquest
operates
and
i
am
not
sure
that
i
like
it
no
glug
but
more
of
a
blorp
like
emptying
a
can
of
food
into
a
bowl
or
dish
i
had
a
brief
finger
of
bonewhite
head
but
it
quickly
dissipated
color
was
a
deep
goldenyellow
with
nequality
clarity
nose
had
the
characteristic
honeylike
sweetness
of
good
adjunctfree
lager
mouthfeel
was
medium
and
the
taste
was
unmistakably
lager
with
a
light
grassiness
thanks
to
the
hops
finish
was
mild
semisweet
very
unobtrusive
given
its
relatively
low
abv
and
unimposing
flavor
i
can
see
why
people
would
flock
to
this
it
is
certainly
appropriate
for
the
cooler
and
the
can
is
a
novelty
but
i
hope
that
it
is
not
a
coming
trend
o
tastes
like
beer
beer
with
a
belgian
touch
not
bad
but
im
digin
the
can
design
big
time
i
hope
it
catches
on
if
everyone
is
going
to
start
switching
to
canning
great
beer
not
sure
if
i
like
the
price
36
its
not
that
memorable
of
a
beer
and
doesnt
have
a
real
signature
taste
its
not
a
bad
beer
its
just
a
good
light
german
ale
its
a
solid
choice
if
youre
a
fan
of
pilsners
sly
fox
does
lagers
as
well
as
anyone
the
can
design
puts
it
over
the
top
this
will
be
a
staple
in
my
fridge
transparent
golden
yellow
with
a
thick
creamy
white
head
the
nose
is
lightly
toasted
grain
with
a
touch
of
dough
malt
balanced
by
a
fairly
assertive
citric
hop
in
the
back
with
a
grassy
earthy
grain
lingering
in
the
back
the
flavor
has
a
more
assertive
grain
flavor
light
notes
of
dough
with
a
strong
citric
bitterness
there
is
a
lightly
floral
and
grassy
hop
note
accompanied
by
some
tangy
rye
like
grain
in
the
finish
really
light
fluffy
and
creamy
feel
with
a
medium
syrupy
body
and
crisp
assertive
carbonation
the
beer
is
balanced
and
smooth
light
and
crisp
nice
stuff
stronger
on
the
grain
side
than
i
love
but
still
very
enjoyable
d
a
simple
and
straightforward
enjoyable
and
refreshing
doesnt
try
to
be
anything
more
than
what
it
actually
is
a
very
drinkable
lager
the
4
6
makes
it
even
more
drinkable
any
one
seeking
out
a
simple
straight
forward
and
well
executed
lager
should
give
this
sly
fox
offering
a
change
overall
a
tasty
beer
and
good
rendition
of
the
style
overall
delicious
and
quenching
this
1
is
a
must
to
try
if
you
visit
the
brewpubs
perfect
session
beer
if
youre
in
the
mood
for
a
fresh
german
style
lager
pours
pale
yellow
with
a
fluffy
head
and
lots
of
carbonation
smell
is
grainy
and
bready
with
a
kiss
of
hops
flavor
very
light
grainy
with
a
bit
of
noble
hop
mouthfeel
is
quite
light
great
summer
beer
i
got
hooked
on
this
beer
when
i
was
working
at
the
royal
tavern
in
south
philly
and
since
it
has
become
one
of
my
favorite
lagers
nice
golden
body
crisp
taste
with
very
little
aftertaste
which
is
fine
by
me
pretty
good
example
of
the
style
except
for
maybe
being
a
bit
bolder
than
what
you
would
normally
find
great
beer
awesome
brewery
overall
a
nice
light
drinking
lager
that
i
enjoyed
i
have
had
better
lagers
but
sly
fox
did
a
nice
job
making
this
what
its
meant
to
be
5
pint
cheers
if
i
didnt
know
anything
about
any
of
the
beers
this
company
made
and
a
stranger
asked
for
my
recommendationid
tell
them
to
try
anything
except
the
helles
all
of
the
beers
they
make
are
great
except
this
one
the
same
goes
for
what
should
be
a
crisp
lightbodied
beer
it
weighs
heavy
with
an
off
slickness
on
the
tongue
it
is
somewhat
crisp
but
not
enough
to
redeem
this
beer
had
this
moerlein
offering
at
the
wilder
ky
mellow
mushroom
for
a
bengals
game
day
lunch
wanted
something
local
to
cincinnati
and
glad
i
chose
this
came
in
a
chilled
pint
glass
reminded
me
alot
of
stella
artois
but
with
a
smoother
finish
very
tasty
not
bitter
went
very
well
with
an
all
meat
pizza
was
so
impressed
that
i
went
out
and
purchased
a
six
pack
from
party
town
in
erlanger
ky
mediumlight
body
lightly
crisp
carbonation
slightly
dry
finish
this
being
an
ohio
beer
and
me
living
in
ohio
i
admit
that
i
wanted
to
like
it
but
it
really
doesnt
have
much
to
likeor
dislike
for
that
matter
the
nose
and
taste
are
dominated
by
sweet
malt
but
theres
a
considerable
dryness
to
the
finish
flavors
are
muted
here
but
youll
smell
and
taste
bread
and
caramel
the
mouthfeel
is
thin
and
carbonation
is
relatively
low
overall
this
is
a
step
up
from
the
macro
lagers
but
at
8
498
99
for
a
six
pack
it
just
doesnt
have
much
to
make
it
stand
out
from
the
others
beers
in
that
price
range
while
i
didnt
dislike
this
i
wont
be
buying
this
one
again
next
time
im
looking
for
an
ohio
beer
ill
be
sure
to
stick
to
great
lakes
thirsty
dog
or
columbus
brewing
company
i
got
this
out
of
a
variety
pack
it
pours
a
clear
straw
color
with
a
good
amount
of
carbonation
1
finger
white
head
goes
away
quickly
typical
lager
smell
maybe
a
little
more
robust
then
some
this
beer
has
a
lot
of
crispness
to
it
for
what
it
is
this
lager
has
a
wonderful
feel
and
finish
with
its
small
abv
this
beer
could
be
drank
all
night
long
moerlein
as
a
whole
makes
too
many
lagers
but
most
are
quite
good
it
would
be
a
good
start
for
someone
who
only
drinks
budweiser
overall
for
how
light
this
was
i
enjoyed
it
it
represented
the
style
fairly
well
the
blandness
was
the
only
bad
part
while
not
moerleins
best
this
is
still
okay
for
giving
to
your
bmcdrinking
friends
at
tailgates
or
house
parties
its
a
good
transition
beer
as
i
said
or
if
you
dont
necessarily
want
to
go
allout
for
your
regular
goto
beer
this
might
suit
you
overall
a
very
mild
helles
lager
that
leaves
you
wanting
a
bit
more
malt
flavor
very
easy
to
drink
but
one
is
enough
in
a
session
o
this
beer
tastes
a
bit
cleaner
compared
to
other
munich
helles
lagers
and
doesnt
have
quite
as
pronounced
hop
flavors
original
lager
pours
a
golden
color
with
lots
of
carbonation
and
a
nice
size
head
looks
refreshing
there
is
a
nice
strong
pale
aroma
very
dry
but
strong
the
taste
is
a
bit
watery
and
light
at
first
then
finishes
with
a
strong
dry
flavor
on
the
palette
easy
to
drink
and
enjoyable
overall
this
one
took
me
by
surprise
the
first
sip
could
be
better
but
the
beer
gets
better
the
more
you
drink
overall
a
very
drinkable
beer
albeit
lacking
in
intangibles
overall
i
was
a
little
disappointed
with
this
beer
all
the
flavors
were
somewhat
muted
and
it
was
really
boring
not
sure
i
would
seek
out
again
the
flavor
is
sweet
and
yeasty
a
bit
of
noble
hops
really
not
typical
for
the
style
much
better
than
expected
wow
i
must
have
had
much
worse
taste
in
college
or
this
new
iteration
of
cm
doesnt
live
up
to
what
i
remember
either
way
ill
finish
this
sixer
for
nostalgias
sake
but
dont
see
myself
seeking
this
out
again
what
bums
me
out
most
is
that
i
picked
up
extras
of
this
for
a
friend
who
grew
up
in
the
cinci
area
and
intended
to
surprise
him
with
it
now
my
concern
is
that
the
surprise
will
be
at
the
decline
of
this
beer
rather
than
the
fact
that
i
found
it
at
all
o
overall
i
like
this
beer
its
not
the
perfect
helles
but
the
nostalgic
flavor
seems
to
have
grabbed
me
sort
of
like
going
back
in
time
especially
nice
in
the
summertime
bright
frosty
goldcolored
liquid
topped
with
a
thin
bubbly
head
smells
of
sweet
grains
honey
and
candied
vegetables
tastes
similar
to
its
odor
primarily
honey
and
vegetables
very
different
from
the
sweet
vegetable
flavor
associated
with
adjunct
lager
though
has
a
nice
light
body
despite
the
complex
flavor
profilei
could
drink
several
of
these
without
getting
tired
of
it
or
feeling
full
d
easy
to
drink
and
great
to
have
a
cooler
full
of
it
overall
a
step
up
from
the
normal
yellow
fizzy
beers
not
unique
enough
to
grab
my
attention
but
would
drink
again
this
would
be
a
good
gateway
beer
for
bmc
drinkers
drinkability
this
to
me
is
a
step
above
the
macros
it
still
has
some
of
the
characteristics
however
like
the
pronounced
corngrain
aromas
and
taste
this
would
be
nice
in
the
summer
but
i
would
probably
look
elsewhere
after
a
couple
this
stuff
has
a
decent
flavor
and
i
would
take
it
over
a
lot
of
other
sessionable
beers
if
i
had
the
offer
perhaps
it
is
the
season
that
is
making
critical
if
it
were
summer
this
stuff
would
hit
the
spot
this
very
much
called
to
mind
bitburger
poured
golden
a
bit
washedout
flavor
was
clean
and
crisp
with
a
distinctive
german
hops
note
that
to
me
always
carries
a
slight
note
of
grape
just
a
bit
thin
and
lacking
however
not
bad
but
seemed
like
the
grain
bill
could
have
been
improved
if
the
beer
avoided
the
diacetyl
oily
character
attenuated
better
and
had
any
herbal
hop
flavor
or
balanced
bitterness
then
a
better
assessment
can
be
made
with
that
theres
too
many
distractions
not
sure
if
this
is
an
attempt
at
a
munich
helles
or
a
preprohibition
pilsner
or
anywhere
in
between
pretty
nondescript
i
am
not
too
experienced
with
a
munich
helles
but
i
do
like
this
beer
nothing
offsetting
about
it
in
the
taste
though
the
nose
is
a
little
to
vinous
for
my
taste
drinkability
very
very
drinkable
i
could
easily
have
another
of
these
it
went
very
well
with
a
meal
refried
bean
burritos
and
i
could
easily
see
myself
drinking
a
few
of
these
with
some
nuts
on
the
side
popping
them
in
while
chatting
and
drinking
the
beer
for
quite
awhile
but
i
have
a
sweet
tooth
i
think
for
some
this
could
get
old
after
a
few
but
if
you
balance
it
with
something
stronger
or
salty
then
it
will
shine
nicely
d
i
could
easily
see
going
through
a
6pack
of
this
on
a
hot
day
my
enjoyment
of
lager
house
closely
follows
the
progression
of
the
finish
in
this
particular
instance
i
think
a
cooler
temperature
works
in
this
beers
favor
served
in
a
pint
glass
poured
from
a
cellar
temperature
bottle
the
beer
has
a
golden
hue
with
a
bit
orange
mixed
in
there
is
noticeable
carbonation
rising
within
the
glass
there
was
a
small
white
head
but
is
disappeared
very
quickly
virtually
no
lacing
to
speak
of
it
has
an
average
citrus
hop
aroma
its
pleasant
but
unremarkable
it
has
a
typical
malty
flavor
its
a
bit
bready
and
a
bit
buttery
there
is
a
hop
presence
but
it
is
very
small
it
has
a
medium
body
and
very
little
mouth
coating
you
can
really
feel
the
carbonation
bubbles
to
me
it
feels
sharp
on
my
tongue
i
dont
like
it
all
that
much
i
prefer
a
smoother
lager
the
beer
is
pretty
middleoftheroad
when
it
comes
to
drinkablity
it
goes
down
all
right
but
with
every
sip
i
kind
of
wish
i
had
opened
a
different
bottle
theres
nothing
wrong
with
this
beer
its
a
perfectly
well
made
craft
brew
but
its
average
for
the
field
there
are
many
other
beers
i
prefer
more
than

not

it
has
enough
going
for
it
to
be
a
worthwhile
purchase
for
those
cincinnatians
looking
to
drink
locally

d
pretty
good
beer
i
usually
hate
the
style
but
this
one
is
a
winner
i
like
the
idea
that
large
brewers
like
boston
beer
company
try
and
make
a
local
product
but
they
should
put
more
effort
into
it
like
most
of
what
i
have
tasted
from
bbw
i
dont
think
this
is
really
not
up
to
their
normal
standards
drinkability
a
fine
serviceable
lager
when
it
comes
to
light
easy
drinking
but
for
me
im
left
wanting
just
a
skosh
more
in
the
flavor
and
aroma
department
next
time
id
like
to
see
a
little
more
moerlein
all
in
all
this
was
not
bad
but
i
know
there
are
better
helles
out
there
maybe
in
cincy
at
a
bar
i
might
try
this
again
but
i
am
not
running
to
the
store
to
get
more
of
this
anytime
soon
the
lack
of
hop
presence
reminds
me
of
a
cheap
adjunct
lager
definitely
not
up
to
par
for
the
style
i
thought
maybe
i
had
poured
the
wrong
beer
in
my
glass
when
i
first
tasted
this
as
it
tastes
very
bmc
d
pretty
good
beer
i
liked
it
better
as
i
made
my
way
through
the
pint
initially
wasnt
crazy
by
the
end
i
wanted
another
nikki
mouthfeel
is
slightly
watery
and
thin
carbonation
is
good
and
refreshing
decent
summer
lawn
mower
beer
light
body
with
medium
high
carbonation
makes
this
easy
to
toss
back
an
important
quality
in
a
helles
but
otherwise
this
fairly
inoffensive
lager
misses
the
hellesmark
pretty
badly
definitely
not
in
spaten
territory
if
you
are
looking
for
an
inoffensive
quencher
at
a
reasonable
price
this
is
fine
if
you
want

of

this
was
the
first
legal
beer
i
had
two
years
ago
with
an
excellent
steak
dinner
at
the
precinct
in
cincinnati
this
week
i
tried
another
bottle
at
the
southgate
house
and
decided
it
needed
another
review
this
beer
basically
tastes
like
a
slightly
more
flavorful
bmc
it
is
a
bit
more
golden
than
the
others
with
only
a
little
more
taste
and
smell
the
big
advantage
this
has
over
the
big
guys
is
that
its
local
which
raises
it
a
couple
notches
in
my
book
while
nothing
special
i
would
recommend
at
least
trying
it
when
in
the
cincinnati
area
if
for
nothing
else
than
to
support
the
local
brewery
pours
gold
in
color
with
whatever
head
there
is
disappearing
before
i
can
walk
away
from
the
counter
smell
is
malty
but
not
a
very
good
malt
not
a
lot
of
hops
or
spice
in
this
at
all
very
malty
highly
carbonated
tastes
very
bmcish
a
little
puckering
bittering
in
the
end
but
im
not
sure
thats
from
any
semblance
of
hopping
a
little
bit
of
a
letdown

at

this
is
a
damn
fine
session
overall
though
it
ws
a
decent
effort
though
i
have
to
admit
not
very
exciting
i
would
not
mind
trying
it
again
thought
i
would
doubt
that
i
would
pay
for
one
drinkability
hell
yeah
all
day
long
d
this
is
a
very
smooth
brew
id
consider
is
a
summer
beer
a
smooth
drinker
which
could
use
a
bit
more
character
overall
but
still
fulfills
its
intended
purpose
d
nice
easy
and
crowd
pleaser
for
spring
or
summertime
not
my
favorite
style
of
beer
but
it
was
good
for
its
style
id
recommend
it
d
tasty
enough
and
very
sessionable
wouldnt
mind
knocking
a
few
more
of
these
back
after
a
long
day
in
the
sun
their
website
lists
this
as
5
2
abv
mouthfeel
and
drinkability
body
is
medium
with
delicate
carbonation

is
close
to
dry
this
is
an
easy
drinking
beer
that
i
do
enjoy
i
can
definitely
see
myself
picking
this
one
up
again
when
in
the
mood
for
malt
rather
than
hops
drinkability
not
a
great
sessionable
but
a
good
one
it
would
work
for
most
any
season
except
maybe
winter
i
imagine
it
would
do
well
with
a
number
of
foods
too
o
solid
helles
not
the
best
example
but
available
from
majestic
wines
for
equivalent
of
1
60
a
bottle
well
worth
the
money
nice
beer
crispy
fresh
in
my
country
is
a
little
expensive
but
sometimes
i
can
find
it
in
beer
sales
all
in
all
i
would
say
this
is
a
pretty
average
lager
which
came
as
a
bit
of
a
disappointment
to
me
as
i
had
been
expecting
considerably
more
of
a
supposedly
premiumclass
german
lager
great
munich
helles
can
really
taste
the
malt
served
in
a
pilsner
glass
who
knows
how
old
this
bottle
was
and
how
it
was
stored
great
german
helles
lager
found
this
when
i
was
exploring
various
biergartens
in
munich
this
is
a
very
beery
beer
and
one
of
the
best
of
the
style
this
is
an
excellent
beer
the
smell
is
nice
the
taste
is
nice
and
its
one
of
those
beers
that
i
can
drink
all
evening
long
without
feeling
the
need
to
switch
to
a
different
type
o
if
i
didnt
get
the
skunkiness
this
would
have
been
really
good
very
light
smooth
and
drinkable
with
plenty
of
cleanly
sweet
malt
and
just
a
little
punctuating
bitterness
it
also
has
a
sour
quality
which
isnt
too
appealing
ill
take
a
hofbrau
or
spaten
over
this
any
day
o
would
be
great
with
some
bread
and
cheese

huge

buildup
took
a
while
to
go
away
smells
bready
and
of

tastes
of
chemicals
and
grain
something
offputting
about
it
i
got
a
lingering
bitter
aftertaste
im
going
to
have
to
revisit
it
may
be
due
to
not
having
had
a
lager
in
quite
some
time
pours

a
slight
white

some
lacing
left
along
the
glass
as
you
finish
good
amount
of
carbonation
smell
is
sweet
malty
and
fresh
taste
is
also
malty
but
with
a
subtle
hint
of
grapes
medium
bodied
good
session
beer
and
a
good
alternative
for
someone
that
feels
like
getting
a
lager
with
a
little
kick
to
it
but
nothing
crazy
paired
this
with
sausage
and
peppers
on
the
bbq
on
a
hot
summer
day
and
it
was
very
enjoyable
pours
a
pretty
golden
in
color
with
a
good
half
of
a
finger
foamy
white
head
that
settles
down
to
just
along
the
sides
of
the
glass
some
spotty
lacing
is
seen
when
sipped
perfect
carbonation
the
aroma
is
of
bready
malts
for
the
most
part
the
taste
has
more
going
on
even
with
a
sweet
bread
taste
followed
by
a
slight
dry
finish
clean
and
crisp
and
goes
down
easy
no
bitter
or
harsh
aftertaste
at
all
lighter
to
medium
bodied
overall
a
great
brew
final
thoughts
not
quite
as
great
as
i
was
hoping
given
the
freshness
and
dark
bottle
a
good
example
of
the
style
and
worth
a
try
if
you
are
a
fan
of
the
style
nothing
special
but
far
and
above
adjunct
swill
on
the
market
would
i
drink
it
again
on
a
hot
day
its
fine
but
lacks
any
distinguishing
characteristics
pours
a
deep
clear
gold
with
a
creamy
white
head
the
head
has
only
the
barest
retention
slightly
hanging
on
around
the
circumference
of
the
glass
and
leaving
no
lacing
the
aroma
has
nice
bready
malt
with
hints
of
earthy
hops
the
taste
is
similar
but
with
just
a
really
good
depth
to
it
its
not
complicated
its
just
good
the
body
is
not
too
heavy
but
has
a
satisfying
weight
to
it
and
a
light
hops
bite
on
the
finish
always
a
good
lager
overall
beer
3
from
the
paulaner
mix
pack
a
solid
helles
lager
nice
balanced
flavor
and
easy
to
drink
worth
a
try
if
you
want
a
traditional
german
lager
overall
this
is
a
delicious
beer
the
smell
is
nice
the
taste
is
nice

it
is

one
of
those
beers

i
can

all

nothing
exceptional
leaps
out
at
you
with
this
beer
but
it
is
tasty
wet
and
soothing
overall
theres
a
pleasant
marriage
with
the
light
biscuitlike
graininess
and
rounded
hop
bitterness
starting
midway
through
the
sip
and
on
past
the
finish
probably
wont
bowl
you
over
in
any
manner
but
most
likely
wont
disappoint
you
either
o
crisp
helles
w
a
good
taste
although
a
little
too
sweet
for
the
style
imo
helles
lagers
are
such
a
great
style
of
lager
in
regards
to
flavor
there
are
certainly
better
examples
of
the
style
but
its
a
decent
interpretation
of
the
style
overall
it
is
too
watery
and
lacking
in
flavor
however
it
is
very
pleasant
to
drink
otherwise
with
no
bad
qualities
better
than
most
competitors
in
its
category
o
likely
my
favorite
of
the
german
helles
but
as
wrong
as
it
feels
to
say
ill
still
take
stoudts
gold
lager
o
a
very
clean
crisp
refreshing
beer
i
keep
this
one
around
for
when
im
in
the
mood
for
something
very
light
have
received
quite
positive
feedback
from
several
noncraft
beer
drinkers
so
this
seems
to
be
a
nice
gateway
beer
o
a
middle
of
the
road
helles
does
the
job
but
nothing
more
its
unbelievable
to
imagine
that
this
is
what
budweiser
has
been
trying
to
make
all
this
time
this
is
the
quintessential
bright
lager
nothing
heavy
nothing
complex
just
the
basic
super
fresh
beer
ingredients
that
leave
a
light
taste
in
your
mouth
and
you
wanting
more
this
is
definitely
a
beer
i
would
give

my
adjunct

its

wouldnt

turn
it
down
ill
enjoy
finishing
these
off
another
easy
drinking
helles
i
do
love
this
style
overall
a
really
enjoyable
beer
nothing
great
about
it
except
its
simplicity
which
is
an
awesome
thing
to
have
a
pleasure
to
drink
it
slips
down
a
treat
overall
an
average
lager
nothing
special
overall
i
enjoy
this
beer
every
time
and
will
always
come
back
to
it
at
several
points
in
the
year
superb
poured
into
a
pint
glass

a
thick
white
head
and
plentiful
streaming
bubbles
the
head
dissipates
slowly
the
beer
smells
of
barley
malt
and
some
grassiness
from
the
noble
hops
the
taste
follows
the
nose
to
the
letter
i
get
those
flavors
of
the
malt
which
are
pretty
bready
those
noble
hops
provide
some
nice
mild
grassiness
on
the
back
end
to
help
balance
the
beer
the
body
is
light
to
medium
with
moderate
carbonation
the
drinkability
is
very
high
this
is
a
very
good
beer
and
a
solid
example
of
this
style
this
is
a
decent
malty
sessionable
beer
it
has
good
flavor
but
little
in
the
way
of
hop
character
it
was
enjoyable
once
but
im
not
sure
ill
pick
it
up
again
overall
a
very
good
german
lager
buy
some
and
share
it
with
your
friends
o
the
flavor
in
this
beer
isnt
quite
as
bright
compared
to
other
munich
helles
lagers
but
it
is
easy
to
drink

fresh

with
a
pretty
attractive
foamy
glossy
ricky
head
herbally
trace

the
taste

almost
light

finish

the
eye
ressembles

no
pretentions
but
quality

very
good

what
it

refreshing

easy

brew
a
go
to
for
a
traditional
refreshing
beer
a
perfectly
clear
golden
beer
it
initially
has
a
foamy
head
of
about
2
fingers
but
it
quickly
fades
down
to
a
thin
covering
the
aroma
has
a
grainy
slightly
spicy
character
to
it
as
it
enters
the
nose
like
wheat
and
cloves
and
one
can
also
detect
banana
and
european
hops
as
well
the
flavor
is
nice
and
balanced
with
a
sturdy
malt
foundation
and
just
the
right
amount
of
hop
bitterness
it
is
light
bodied
but
feels
good
coating
the
mouth
and
going
down
the
only
negative
i
find
is
that
there
is
a
tiny
bit
of
a
metallicoxidized
off
flavor
in
there
sometimes
overall
this
is
a
staple
everyday
beer
in
my
refrigerator
there
is
nothing
special
about
this
beer
it
looks
yelloworangeish
in
color
it

it

of
about
the

things
the
mouthfeel
is
crisp
light
to
medium
in
body
not
very
filling
which
is
a
good
thing
for
someone
wanting
to
drink
a
step
up
from
the
bmcs
overall
its
really
just
an
average
compare
to
lets
say
their
hefeweizen
or
oktoberfest
which
are
so
much
better
made

a
wonder
balance

very
easy

after

i
love
this
beer
and
many
of
their
other
formulas
served
from
bottle
into
a
shaker
poured
a
pale
golden
yellow
with
a
one
finger
pure
white
that
subsided
to
a
minimal
amount
slowly
maintained
decent
lacing
throughout
the
glass
the
aroma
was
comprised
of
sweet
malt
wheat
grain
spices
rice
fruit
and
subtle
alcohol
the
flavor
was
of
sweet
malt
wheat
grain
spices
floral
fruit
and
very
subtle
alcohol
it
had
a
light
feel
on
the
palate
with
mild
carbonation
overall
this
was
a
decent
brew
the
aroma
on
this
one
was
definitely
not
my
favorite
of
this
style
however
the
flavor
did
a
pretty
good
job
of
making
up
for
this
the
flavor
was
really
nicely
balanced
but
wasnt
very
complex
unfortunately
worth
trying
for
sure
as
it
is
very
easy
to
drink
worthy
brew
high
drinkability
yet
tasty
i
would
buy
more
to
stock
my
inventory
as
this
beer
could
be
able
to
match
in
any
occasion
not
a
bad
helles
but
far
from
being
my
favorite
of
the
style
poured
into
a
standard
pint
glass
the
beer
is
a
light
straw
yellow
a
foamy
head
sits
on
top
and
dissipates
to
an
even
layer
then
a
white
ring
smells
of
lemon
grass
and
faint
citrus
the
beer
tastes
like
it
smells
a
lemony
undertone
with
a
crisp
citrus
finish
the
mouthfeel
is
light
bright
and
very
drinkable
overall
this
would
be
a
great
beer
to
have
at
a
pub
while
watching
a
game
highly
sessionable
very
refreshing
and
it
just
tastes
really
good
overall
a
very
good
representation
of
style
not
my
favorite
but
on
sale
for
3
99
impossible
to
pass
up
surprising
i
had
not
tried
this
paulaner
offering
before
despite
my
lackluster
interest
in
traditional
german
styles
this
one
is
worth
a
second
try
for
me
just
turned
21
recently
and
this
was
one
of
the
first
biers
i
graded
i
had
it
on
tap
at
the
alpine
village
in
torrance
ca
this
is
still
one
of
the
best
biers
i
have
ever
tried
clean
solid
taste
very
smooth
and
tastes
great
i
recommend
it
to
everyone
overall
not
bad
fairly
light
but
should
be
nice
lager
flavors
no
real
off
flavors
the
finish
gets
a
bit
iffy
though
with
the
hops
getting
a
bit
to
nagging
bitter
and
not
much
clean
or
crisp
like
it
started
also
not
sure
where
the
haze
comes
from
but
it
should
be
fairly
clear
d
highly
drinkable
light
and
clean
with
no
bad
aftertaste
this
is
a
drinkable
refreshing
beer
o
this
is
a
boring
beer
a
very
drinkabledonthavetothinkaboutit
boring
but
still
kind
of
boring
o
i
like
this
one
i
like
a
lot
of
beers
but
this
is
up
my
ally
the
appearance
and
smell
in
the
paulaner
original
are
fine
and
what
youd
expect
its
good
tasting
no
long
lingering
finish
just
grains
malt
a
little
lemony
spice
and
clean
feel
on
the
palate
i
cant
say
im
not
impressed
any
beer
that
tastes
just
like
it
should
taste
works
for
me
id
get
this
again
its
a
good
anytime
beer
the
rest
body
is
medium
for
a
lager
this
is
far
superior
to
the
bmc
lagers
its
slightly
grainy
without
the
offputting
adjunct
taste
with
a
nice
hint
of
bitterness
good
brew
overall
easy
to
drink
clean
taste
overall
its
tasty
would
have
it
again
for
sure
overall
everything
about
this
beer
was
quite
good
except
for
the
flavor
which
is
where
it
really
counts
there
was
nothing
off
about
this
one
but
the
flavor
was
simply
too
weak
and
watery
to
really
be
worth
drinking
one
of
the
weaker
examples
of
the
style
skip
this
and
reach
for
a
augustiner
when
in
munich
my
brother
likes
this
beer
he
says
he
drank
a
lot
of
it
in
germany
and
it
was
his
favorite
so
he
gave
me
one
to
try
thanks
g
it
pours
golden
and
is
capped
with
a
billowing
offwhite
head
lacing
ensues
good
looking
for
a
lager
the
brew
is
malty
in
a
pale
and
honeyish
way
and
besides
that
it
offers
some
mineral
notes
a
herbal
bitterness
on
the
finish
and
a
delicate
floral
aroma
lively
carbonation
and
refreshing
overall
this
is
a
very
nice
lager
o
this
is
a
very
good
lager
from
a
brewery
that
also
produces
one
of
the
best
hefewaizenbeers
out
there
i
would
buy
this
lager
again
mouthfeel
is
crisp
light
and
dry
very
clean
with
little
aftertaste
this
is
a
simple
and
enjoyably
refreshing
lager
easy
drinking
session
beer
that
i
would
buy
again
imo
the
germans
make
the
best
beer
in
the
world
and
this
fine
beer
is
one
of
the
countries
best
clear
yellow
color
with
a
tall
lasting
lumpy
white
head
on
top
aromas
of
pale
cereal
malt
honey
and
soft
floral
noble
hops
grassyearthy
hops
and
dusty
grain
greet
the
tongue
a
hint
of
lemon
finishing
with
gentle
sweetness
decently
crisp
lightbodied
and
certainly
poundable
solid
helles
i
remember
that
dry
character
from
the
fresh
beers
in
munich
but
it
seems
to
suffer
from
exportpasteurization
becomes
sort
of
harsh
close
to
astringent
too
bad
cheers
oif
this
were
still
drinkability
it
would
get
a
4
5
overall
though
its
a
very
run
of
the
mill
and
unimpressive
lager
im
not
drinking
lager
haterade
either
they
have
grown
on
me
over
the
past
year
but
there
are
much
finer
german
lagers
out
there
than
this
if
you
want
a
good
paulaner
beer
stick
with
their
hefeweizen
it
is
delicious
rjt
o
highly
drinkable
and
simple
but
still
a
beer
with
some
character
and
no
flaws
the
perfect
drink
if
you
are
looking
for
something
refreshing
t
some
slightly
staletasting
grassy
hops
pale
malts
and
a
pretty
heavy
metallic
taste
the
finish
is
pretty
clean
and
the
drinkability
is
pretty
good
on
this
one
still
its
not
one
of
the
better
german
beers
ive
had
very
good
refreshing
lager
that
id
be
happy
to
have
again
drinkability
this
is
a
nice
lager
i
am
not
a
huge
fan
of
the
style
but
i
could
have
several
of
these
overall
a
good
dependable
product
from
paulaner
opinion
well
i
would
have
to
say
that
this
is
a
classic
example
of
this
style
so
it
is
going
to
get
high
marks
there
isnt
a
whole
lot
for
me
to
say
about
it
but
the
subtlety
of
this
beer
speaks
for
the
style
well
that
said
i
would
take
an
augustiner
helles
over
this
any
day
but
it
still
a
good
brew
and
one
of
the
better
malt
accentuated
beers
available
here
is
texas
at
the
time
from
notes
subtle
bready
notes
in
the
nose
pours
a
sparkling
clear
straw
the
mostly
lasting
white
creamy
head
is
super
sticky
stiff
like
meringue
and
leaves
behind
light
lace
the
flavor
is
typical
of
a
lager
well
balanced
but
nondescript
light
acidity
leads
to
a
grainy
finish
the
light
creamy
body
is
soft
wont
knock
off
augustiner
as
my
fave
for
the
style
but
nevertheless
a
solid
brew
from
paulaner
d
deliciouscleansubtle
and
restrained
a
welcome
relief
to
the
overthetop
hop
bombs
that
are
all
the
rage
vivaldi
vs
acdc
the
epitome
of
a
session
beer
nice
beer
for
warm
and
hot
day
and
party
opener
drinkability
very
easy
to
drink
this
beer
if
you
are
looking
for
a
good
lager
this
will
hit
the
spot
i
dont
get
much
of
a
chance
to
try
helles
lagers
this
particular
one
pours
a
crystal
clear
light
golden
color
with
a
quickly
dissipating
white
cap
of
foam
very
clean
the
aroma
is
subtle
as
expected
for
the
style
barely
toasted
barley
is
detectable
very
crisp
and
clean
on
the
palate
the
malt
is
the
highlight
but
it
gives
way
to
touch
of
citrus
which
sticks
with
the
palate
after
the
beer
is
gone
drinkable
and
balanced
my
friend
brought
me
6
pack
of
12oz
bottles
i
would
not
buy
it
myself
the
beer
has
no
color
no
smell
no
taste
i
dont
understand
how
people
can
drink
this
i
guess
coors
light
would
taste
like
that
if
i
tried
it
but
at
least
that
one
is
cheap
drinkability
very
drinkable
well
balanced
and
pleasing
one
of
my
favorites
of
the
style
never
had
this
one
in
the
states
perhaps
the
quality
suffers
a
bit
in
transport
d
average
nothing
special
md
drinks
smoothly
the
taste
isnt
the
best
so
the
drink
ability
is
effected
strong
carbonation
tingle
d
nice
feel
pretty
good
taste
lower
alcohol
drinkable
drinkability
well
this
is
very
good
in
the
drinkability
department
while
the
each
of
the
individual
components
of
this
beer
are
just
above
average
these
things
combined
are
more
than
the
sum
of
their
parts
this
beer
went
really
fast
refreshing
and
outstanding
with
a
meal
and
i
could
easily
have
another
one
or
two
so
very
sessionable
as
well
an
outstanding
drinkable
beer
thank
goodness
i
got
a
six
pack
of
this
what
a
classy
frat
party
teehee
it
pours
a
clear
pale
golden
straw
topped
by
a
nice
finger
of
thick
white
froth
the
nose
comprises
flowers
very
light
lemon
wedge
and
light
wheat
the
taste
holds
notes
of
coriander
lemon
wedge
lots
o
grasses
wheat
and
flowers
the
body
is
light
with
a
light
moderate
carbonation
and
a
refreshing
feel
overall
a
nice
helles
the
quality
probably
due
to
the
freshness
which
ive
never
seen
in
a
stateside
german
beer
before
this
was
an
incredibly
fresh
batch
of
this
stuff
it
appeared
as
pale
as
youd
expect
this
beer
to
be
but
it
rocked
a
nice
finger
or
so
of
the
head
as
well
the
aromas
were
a
bit
off
they
smelled
quite
strongly
of
hops
that
were
getting
close
to
being
too
old
as
well
as
a
serious
amount
of
pale
malt
aroma
the
taste
however
was
rather
straight
forward
and
real
pleasant
the
hops
tasted
rather
fresh
still
on
the
palate
and
the
malts
were
savory
and
crisp
on
a
side
note
i
was
so
happy
because
i
was
later
able
to
consume
bratwurst
which
works
so
well
with
that
fresh
on
the
palate
the
mouth
feel
was
a
bit
syrupy
but
then
again
this
was
old
school
from
the
keg
who
knows
how
the
carbonation
worked
it
still
tastes
really
fresh
and
went
down
so
very
smooth
it
was
one
hell
of
a
good
beer
the
mouthfeel
is
also
very
clean
with
a
light
touch
of
bubbles
and
slight
hop
bitterness
an
easy
drinker
that
is
all
around
above
average
this
one
goes
down
easy
and
has
some
nice
mild
flavor
to
it
i
can
sit
and
drink
on
this
one
all
night
very
easy
to
drink
it
is
refreshing
and
can
be
enjoyed
as
a
social
beer
very
little
complexity
but
tastes
good
for
the
flavor
that
it
has
i
would
buy
it
again
as
a
beer
to
share
with
friends
who
do
not
like
very
complex
beer
d
good
beer
would
have
another
3
5
pretty
good
doesnt
have
great
flavor
but
decent
the
combo
of
that
with
it
being
light
crisp
and
refreshing
makes
it
an
easy
beer
to
drink
a
good
sessionable
beer
d
very
easy
to
drink
and
even
easier
to
order
a
second
before
you
are
half
way
done
your
first
since
it
is
officially
oktoberfest
in
munich
now
i
figured
on
getting
a
slew
of
german
beers
to
celebrate
this
one
is
the
first
stop
nice
golden
yellow
with
an
egg
shell
head
crackery
grain
clean
and
crisp
with
a
little
hop
kick
at
the
end
pretty
simple
but
so
damn
good
a
nice
place
to
start
i
love
the
paulaner
lineup
of
brews
o
high
drinkability
paulaner
quality
great
german
lager
excellent
session
beer
pours
a
pale
golden
yellow
colour
with
about
a
finger
of
head
nice
retention
smell
is
of
floral
hops
with
biscuity
malt
the
malt
and
hops
both
seem
to
come
out
more
in
the
flavour
than
in
the
smell
very
well
balanced
lager
i
had
this
right
after
the
paulaner
premium
pils
and
prefered
this
decently
drinkable
beer
with
some
flaws
but
it
certainly
isnt
bad
by
any
means
no
reason
to
get
overly
excited
but
give
it
a
try
if
the
price
is
right
ive
had
better
and
worse
from
the
style
but
definitely
had
better
from
paulaner
drinkable
but
boring
same
as
any
other
yellow
beer
i
prefer
weihenstephaner
original
over
this
any
day
this
beer
is
definitely
one
that
can
be
enjoyed
by
anybody
probably
a
good
introduction
to
better
beer
for
the
uninitiated
i
can
imagine
making
this
a
regular
session
beer
all
in
all
a
very
good
lager
a
good
beer
for
a
scorching
hot
day
this
lager
appears
a
light
yellow
color
bubbles
rise
rapidly
from
the
bottom
of
the
pilsner
glass
there
is
a
pretty
average
sized
head
that
fades
rapidly
leaving
a
thin
coating
of
lacing
on
the
glass
the
smell
is
pretty
straight
forward
and
simple
pilsner
malt
and
a
slightly
sweet
flavor
comprise
the
taste
and
the
aroma
the
feel
is
pretty
thin
as
expected
this
beer
is
crisp
refreshing
and
very
easy
to
drink
there
are
no
off
flavors
or
astringent
notes
that
i
detect
overall
a
plain
simple
decent
tasting
brew
that
goes
down
easy
paulaner
lager
has
a
refreshing
appearance
with
shades
of
pale
gold
the
head
wanes
but
leaves
a
consistent
thin
layer
supported
by
carbonation
streamers
the
bouquet
is
similar
to
the
smell
of
yeast
bread
the
taste
is
crisp
balanced
with
a
little
yeast
and
sweetness
and
a
slight
hops
floral
jumps
in
the
mouth
the
texture
is
light
and
smooth
this
lager
is
very
drinkable
and
could
be
a
designated
hitter
for
the
entire
night
drinkability
the
flavor
is
good
and
the
beer
is
somewhat
drinkable
but
the
lack
of
a
decent
mouthfeel
really
hurts
this
one
for
me
im
thinking
ill
have
to
try
this
beer
again
sometime
down
the
road
perhaps
there
were
bottling
issues
with
this
batch
more
muted
banana
taste
pricklier
feel
be
it
from
the
hops
or
the
carbonation
taste
certainly
exceeded
appearance
some
lemon
came
in
light
bodied
lightly
hopped
little
bitterness
but
close
to
full
flavored
a
decent
hot
weather
beer
kind
of
pricey
for
what
you
get
is
this
all
you
could
ever
want
in
a
beer
the
short
is
yes
with
an
if
and
the
long
answer
is
no
with
a
but
paulaner
münchner
is
a
simple
if
conventional
beer
but
its
emblematic
of
germanys
outstanding
tradition
of
crafting
clean
agreeable
insanely
quaffable
lagers
which
is
about
all
you
could
want
from
a
typical
beer
mouthfeel
is
light
and
refreshing
this
beer
is
a
pounder
you
can
drink
one
right
after
another
easily
i
wish
i
had
one
of
those
bierstiefel
boot
shaped
mugs
d
this
is
a
good
lager
i
couldnt
believe
that
i
had
never
triedpurchased
it
i
always
assumed
that
i
had
tried
all
of
paulaners
regular
lineup
this
was
worth
buying
excellent
beer
to
substitute
for
bad
macro
brews
all
the
companions
are
there
but
mild
the
head
is
not
as
voluminous
as
a
proper
german
lager
but
the
nice
is
a
mild
apple
yeasty
a
very
balanced
beer
in
body
and
palate
with
nice
light
fizz
palate
of
gentle
hops
and
a
soft
sweet
finish
with
a
bit
of
earth
overall
hits
the
spot
on
a
hot
summer
day
a
very
refreshing
beer
no
off
flavors
and
grain
notes
to
speak
of
a
good
beer
a
very
easy
drinking
and
sessionable
lager
with
just
a
classic
beer
profile
i
can
see
myself
drinking
a
lot
of
this
in
the
company
of
friends
or
at
a
party
light
and
mild
but
tasty
just
what
you
look
for
in
this
kind
of
beer
in
all
respects
above
average
this
isnt
a
bad
beer
just
not
that
exciting
much
better
on
tap
if
you
can
find
it
fairly
typical
of
this
style
of
beer
d
session
session
session
crisp
clean
nicely
carbonated
a
great
quencher
body
is
pretty
light
though
there
is
plenty
of
flavor
within
and
drinkability
is
very
high
indeed
i
was
very
impressed
with
this
beer
i
wasnt
expecting
too
much
out
of
it
it
pours
like
a
very
traditional
beer
it
is
a
lovely
shade
of
gold
with
foamy
white
head
that
laces
the
glass
by
no
means
will
this
beer
blow
you
away
there
isnt
a
great
deal
of
flavor
but
the
little
flavor
it
has
is
pleasing
there
is
little
aftertaste
which
makes
this
very
easy
to
drink
i
can
imagine
it
would
be
easy
to
drink
many
of
these
beers
in
one
sitting
this
is
a
very
good
beer
that
shouldnt
be
overlooked
this
is
a
world
class
brewery
perhaps
best
known
for
its
hefe
weizen
this
is
a
very
satisfying
helles
just
not
at
the
very
top
of
the
style
a
fine
helles
for
sessions
i
think
i
like
this
better
than
the
hacker
edelhell
notes
what
can
really
be
said
about
a
beer
such
as
this
its
not
flashy
it
wont
knock
your
socks
off
but
then
again
thats
not
really
the
point
with
a
beer
of
this
sort
paulaner
original
is
just
plain
old
good
beer
so
im
going
to
drink
up
a
bit
on
the
waterythin
side
just
a
little
lighter
than
appropriate
carbonation
seems
spot
on
the
brew
is
damned
drinkable
easy
drinking
can
go
well
with
food
or
great
on
a
summer
day
good
simple
beer
after
2
youd
want
something
more
interesting
but
youd
never
knock
this
either
decent
conclusion
is
it
crazy
complex
nope
does
it
need
to
be
nope
this
beer
would
make
for
a
nice
daily
drinker
perfect
with
german
food
or
pizza
d
a
very
easy
drinker
that
it
the
essence
of
what
a
lager
should
taste
like
nothing
bad
to
say
here
as
clean
a
lager
as
they
come
spot
on
for
the
style
d
very
easy
to
drink
light
enough
that
it
is
easy
to
drink
a
lot
of
it
notes
somewhat
like
a
lager
especially
in
the
body
but
more
bready
and
more
hops
than
the
macros
a
little
thin
for
a
wheat
beer
but
good
beer
d
highly
drinkable
refreshing
not
as
good
as
other
paulaner
options
especially
the
ones
you
can
get
in
germany
but
a
great
beer
none
the
less
wouldnt
be
one
of
my
first
preferences
would
generally
prefer
something
with
more
flavour
even
for
a
basic
lager
but
works
well
for
the
style
and
is
enjoyable
poured
a
straw
yellow
with
good
carbonation
lots
of
bubbles
rising
to
the
top
nice
white
head
looks
good
nose
is
grains
light
hops
some
citrus
taste
is
grains
light
hops
floral
and
a
bit
of
citrus
maybe
light
honey
hardly
any
booze
no
bite
just
easy
drinking
and
very
tasty
wow
i
could
drink
alot
of
this
not
because
of
low
abv
but
because
it
is
tasty
and
crisp
d
goes
down
super
smooth
very
very
sessionable
particularly
in
the
wamer
weather
pours
a
crystal
clear
pale
yellow
with
a
medium
white
head
that
fades
fast
smells
of
fresh
dough
and
a
hint
of
sulfur
taste
is
bready
sweetness
up
front
with
a
very
herbal
earthy
middle
and
a
bittersweet
finish
mouthfeel
is
slightly
thin
medium
carbonation
drinkability
is
quite
good
i
suspect
if
american
macro
brewers
did
not
create
their
beers
to
be
so
bland
they
would
taste
similar
to
this
look
yellow
nector
color
apparently
cloudy
very
white
and
fat
foamy
head
smell
sweet
malt
and
toffee
essences
taste
sweet
malt
slightly
smoky
and
spice
create
notes
to
bitter
olives
mouthfeel
refreshing
and
bittersweet
medium
body
drinkability
reminds
me
birra
moretti
very
easy
to
drink
nice
bubbly
body
head
rather
fluffy
i
consider
average
the
body
was
golden
wheat
in
color
it
has
a
very
smooth
mouthfeel
you
get
a
good
tingle
when
it
runs
down
the
back
of
your
tongue
has
a
very
sweet
taste
with
a
hint
of
bitterness
i
really
enjoyed
this
beer
this
beer
has
given
me
a
new
sense
of
hope
for
lagers
i
never
had
a
good
lager
but
now
that
i
found
one
and
it
has
inspired
me
to
not
completely
right
them
off
d
overall
a
very
satisfying
brew
that
goes
well
with
an
evening
meal
d
easy
to
have
a
few
as
it
isnt
too
heavy
and
has
the
typical
bitter
aftertaste
of
a
lager
but
there
is
nothing
too
special
taste
defines
grainy
freshly
crushed
light
malted
barley
is
dominant
there
is
some
light
floral
and
grassy
hop
flavors
to
help
balance
things
out
a
bit
this
is
one
of
the
cleanest
beers
i
have
ever
had
amazing
job
by
the
brewers
to
eliminate
any
offflavors
this
is
a
very
good
helles
lager
and
one
i
would
love
to
try
fresh
from
the
source
cheers
overall
definitely
on
the
lower
end
of
the
flavour
scale
of
european
lagers
but
still
a
quality
helles
overall
this
is
a
pretty
solid
lager
i
think
i
may
have
gotten
an
older
bottle
based
on
other
reviews
since
i
hardly
noticed
the
hops
in
this
one
ill
definitely
try
it
again
and
see
but
this
would
be
a
great
beer
to
drink
while
eating
a
pizza
and
watching
a
game
this
was
my
first
time
drinking
this
particular
beer
and
i
am
duly
impressed
another
fine
product
that
will
always
have
a
home
in
my
fridge
dvery
drinkable
could
definitely
enjoy
quite
a
few
of
these
on
a
poker
night
feel
good
in
the
mouth
and
is
refreshing
d
overall
its
a
really
good
beer
of
the
style
one
of
the
best
ive
had
very
refreshing
and
very
memorable
the
fruitiness
is
outstanding
d
even
tho
its
a
bit
chilly
here
today
this
beer
downright
tastes
great
could
will
drink
several
of
these
esp
on
a
nice
warm
day
with
burgers
hot
dogs
or
even
a
pizza
pours
a
clear
golden
yellow
nice
rich
colour
big
and
thick
white
head
forms
slowly
settles
down
to
a
thick
ring
around
the
glass
good
layer
good
lacing
great
retention
on
this
one
smell
is
nice
really
toasty
and
biscuity
caramel
honey
pretty
intense
aroma
tons
of
biscuit
and
toast
character
some
floral
really
well
done
very
clean
taste
is
similar
nice
sweet
malty
character
up
front
honey
and
some
caramel
big
biscuity
middle
burnt
toast
floral
very
clean
and
malty
popcorn
nice
clean
herbal
bitter
finish
mouthfeel
is
light
bodied
with
medium
carbonation
very
nice
helles
and
very
drinkable
i
really
dig
this
stuff
overall
a
nice
munich
helles
lager
for
a
good
price
a
perfect
option
for
something
refreshing
and
sessionable
or
perhaps
a
good
beer
to
have
bmc
fans
give
a
shot
i
cant
help
but
feel
that
the
problem
here
is
one
of
freshness
with
the
long
journey
from
europe
taking
its
toll
on
the
quality
of
this
beer
d
another
solid
brew
that
has
mass
appeal
and
can
be
enjoyed
by
all
an
enjoyable
offering
that
goes
well
with
pizza
football
and
good
friends
recommended
as
safe
option
which
is
very
approachable
to
a
wide
audience
i
was
not
very
impressed
by
this
beer
poured
a
nice
golden
color
with
a
decent
aroma
the
major
complaint
i
have
with
this
beer
was
in
its
drinkability
and
mouthfeel
i
had
a
whole
6
pack
in
1
sitting
and
it
just
sat
way
too
heavy
for
a
beer
of
this
style
this
beer
pours
exactly
like
a
nice
pilsnera
pale
see
thru
straw
colour
with
nice
carbonation
that
leaves
a
fast
vanishing
two
finger
head
and
a
ring
of
lacingthe
aroma
is
average
with
smells
of
malted
barleyish
coated
hopsit
has
an
average
mouthfeel
with
a
barleyish
hop
tastedefinately
not
the
best
example
of
the
style
that
ive
tried
and
tastes
more
like
a
pilsner
but
in
saying
that
could
easily
drink
this
as
a
nice
session
beer
grainy
and
sweet
on
the
nose
with
a
bit
of
barnyard
going
on
which
settles
out
with
a
bit
of
exposure
nice
sweet
hop
nose
when
agitated
a
bit
taste
follows
and
is
somewhat
simple
sweet
for
the
style
not
offering
a
lot
of
body
or
depth
to
the
malt
structure
rather
crisp
nonetheless
and
with
a
lingering
light
lemon
finish
light
body
limits
this
beer
however
typical
appearance
for
the
style
id
have
a
pretty
difficult
time
rating
the
appearance
of
any
munich
helles
or
pilsener
a
5
since
they
all
look
more
or
less
the
same
smell
is
wonderful
fresh
clean
and
crisp
with
spicy
noble
hops
making
their
presence
known
taste
is
fantastic
crisp
and
tart
with
just
enough
malt
sweetness
to
balance
i
love
it
ample
carbonation
suits
this
brew
well
highly
drinkable
this
beer
always
does
it
for
me
a
favorite
to
be
sure
severely
underrated
in
my
opinion
call
me
crazy
but
to
me
this
is
comparable
to
weihenstephaner
original
only
much
easier
to
find
d
easy
to
drink
nice
and
refreshing
crisp
and
clean
could
easily
drink
a
couple
the
beer
was
light
bodied
with
the
classic
taste
of
a
german
pilsner
beer
very
drinkable
session
beer
that
is
very
refreshing
glad
i
have
a
sixer
too
watery
this
helles
is
very
traditional
a
bit
bland
overall
but
clean
with
no
off
flavors
i
could
drink
it
on
a
hot
day
for
sure
but
its
not
exactly
a
session
beer
as
i
would
get
bored
easily
worth
a
try
not
the
most
complex
lager
ive
had
which
is
a
good
thing
when
you
want
something
easy
refreshing
to
drink
a
dark
golden
color
with
white
foamy
head
the
taste
and
aroma
were
sweeter
than
i
imagined
a
bit
more
malty
than
hoppy
a
mediummedium
body
it
was
very
smooth
with
just
a
bit
of
crispness
im
definitely
going
back
for
more
of
these
notes
a
session
brew
with
a
solid
drinkability
i
was
new
to
the
helles
style
lager
when
i
tried
this
and
came
away
thinking
this
was
a
slightly
above
average
beer
it
felt
thin
on
the
tongue
but
still
had
a
decent
taste
of
hops
was
very
drinkable
excellent
for
a
hot
summer
day
one
of
the
better
pale
lagers
i
have
enjoyed
light
crisp
and
refreshing
feel
plus
good
taste
make
this
a
very
easy
beer
to
drink
d
great
session
beer
if
not
a
terribly
complex
one
not
my
favorite
paulaner
beer
but
a
nice
representation
of
the
style
the
low
abv
makes
this
beer
go
down
very
easy
quite
a
good
beer
really
possibly
deserves
to
score
higher
i
just
found
it
a
little
boring
weihenstephaner
makes
a
better
tastier
helles
lager
overall
very
light
easy
drinking
beer
with
a
sutle
malt
sweetness
i
could
drink
a
few
of
these
but
i
only
bought
one
pint
this
spring
so
far
d
give
me
a
twelve
pack
of
these
and
i
would
be
glad
to
finish
them
any
time
a
great
big
2
finger
head
over
the
pale
gold
body
sure
looks
the
part
a
hoppy
nose
albeit
seems
to
getting
on
a
bit
in
freshness
slight
touch
of
lemon
in
the
background
with
a
niggling
smell
of
weet
bix
that
would
be
a
cereal
aroma
drinks
lightcreamy
and
smooth
with
a
mild
bitterness
a
nice
long
finish
with
a
pleasant
aftertaste
id
definitely
drink
it
again
this
helles
is
totally
well
balanced
with
not
too
much
carbonation
that
it
drowns
out
the
taste
this
leaves
the
palate
very
refreshed
and
ready
to
have
some
more
i
wish
i
wouldve
tried
this
beer
sooner
god
bless
paulaner
drinkability
this
is
easily
drinkable
and
i
could
easily
see
having
a
few
in
the
heat
of
summer
or
with
friends
while
sitting
around
chatting
etc
nice
smooth
drinker
with
good
fizzy
carbonation
and
some
light
cerealbarleygrapenut
grain
in
the
malt
profile
hops
are
crisp
slightly
metallic
and
a
nicely
spicy
this
is
one
very
well
balanced
beer
utterly
true
to
the
helles
lager
style
and
soooo
drinkable
delicious
drinkable
enough
light
mouthfeel
goes
down
easy
definitely
one
of
my
favorite
helles
biers
from
munich
especially
among
the
big
brewers
if
you
want
to
compare
it
to
its
brother
hacker
pschorr
lager
just
not
that
everything
about
the
hacker
pschorr
lager
would
be
stronger
and
more
flavorful
i
like
this
one
a
lot
though
i
think
i
slightly
prefer
spaten
over
this
definitely
will
be
having
it
again
im
a
big
fan
of
the
german
helle
lagers
typically
but
this
fails
on
every
front
poured
a
pale
straw
colour
with
very
little
head
that
dissappeared
almost
instantaneously
had
very
little
lacing
smelled
like
straw
with
a
bit
of
a
corn
aroma
taste
and
smell
are
pretty
much
the
same
has
a
slight
bitter
aftertaste
that
lingers
very
thin
mouthfeel
and
quite
watery
with
a
fair
bit
of
fizz
it
is
drinkable
but
not
one
of
my
favourites
this
is
a
slightly
better
than
average
lager
no
off
flavors
or
scents
but
it
just
needed
a
little
something
extra
to
make
me
want
to
go
out
of
my
way
to
have
another
drinkability
an
average
beer
in
the
style
munich
helles
lager
d
certainly
an
easydrinking
beer
though
not
as
drinkable
as
some
of
the
better
examples
of
this
style
i
could
take
a
second
pint
but
thats
about
it
pretty
good
drinkability
decent
atmosphere
good
flavor
light
body
not
overwhelming
on
the
alcohol
gives
this
great
drinkability
good
quaff
foam
is
creamyi
would
just
appreciate
it
would
last
much
morecarbonation
too
is
easily
lost
giving
a
bad
taste
to
the
last
sips
d
balance
taste
with
a
crisp
mouthfeel
make
this
one
pretty
drinkable
for
me
drinkability
smooth
and
creamy
with
enough
flavor
to
make
it
interesting
not
my
favorite
style
but
a
classic
example
of
this
style
this
beer
has
a
very
sweet
and
grainy
aroma
it
is
a
bit
grassy
but
not
as
grassy
as
some
other
beers
of
this
style
it
has
a
straw
gold
color
that
has
an
almost
ivory
colored
head
and
lace
the
flavor
is
crisp
and
for
the
most
part
malty
there
is
very
earth
but
mild
spicy
flavor
this
is
a
very
clean
and
light
beer
i
would
say
that
it
is
refreshing
and
versatile
at
the
time
of
consuming
this
beer
i
was
not
wasted
but
i
cannot
honestly
say
i
tasted
this
with
a
fresh
palate
i
will
rereview
this
beer
at
a
later
time
sweet
grainy
aroma
pretty
subdued
light
golden
pour
mild
head
with
some
minimal
lacing
and
nice
steady
carbonation
crisp
with
a
touch
of
sourness
to
the
mouthfeel
rather
refreshing
nice
taste
lightly
hopped
to
a
light
malt
content
sweet
and
grassy
its
tasty
but
i
enjoyed
the
harp
i
had
prior
to
this
much
more
d
great
like
beers
in
this
style
something
about
the
light
characteristics
make
is
very
drinkable
easy
drinking
lager
pretty
representative
of
the
style
a
clean
light
bodied
beer
paired
with
a
good
carbonation
level
that
crisps
things
up
and
creates
an
easy
drinking
beer
something
that
is
meant
to
be
enjoyed
by
the
liter
this
is
surely
the
thing
for
the
job
it
is
very
drinkable
and
enjoyable
preferably
served
quite
cold
a
fine
beer
with
many
of
the
characteristics
i
look
for
in
a
lager
it
had
a
nice
light
golden
color
while
retaining
a
small
head
with
light
lacing
down
the
glass
i
like
the
nice
maltiness
in
the
smell
the
taste
is
smooth
while
being
crisp
and
having
a
mediumlight
weight
on
the
palate
the
malt
flavor
is
balanced
nicely
by
the
hops
on
the
back
end
i
can
drink
a
whole
lot
of
these
d
i
dont
drink
a
lot
of
lagers
but
i
could
drink
several
of
these
very
nice
taste
is
malty
with
hop
finish
making
this
beer
unobjectionable
but
not
remarkable
it
would
be
nice
to
try
this
on
tap
really
fresh

drinkable

d
a
nice
simple
german
lager
wont
hurt
your
brain
thinking
about
this
one
you
pretty
much
get
what
you
expect
a
well
made
easy
to
drink
unoffensive
fairly
plain
lager
md
this
one
is
best
cold
and
i
enjoyed
it
that
way
a
unique
beer
and
a
quite
good
one
at
that
i
dont
want
to
have
children
with
it

this
beer
pours
a
clear
golden
color
the
head
is
bright
white
fluffy
and
recedes
very
slowly
into
thick
chunky
lacing
the
aroma
is
of
bready
malt
mild
noble
hops
and
a
hint
of
metal
the
taste
is
breadier
than
the
aroma
with
only
a
trace
of
hops
the
mouthfeel
is
on
the
lighter
side
of
medium
bodied
with
nice
lively
carbonation
overall
this
is
a
fine
helles
that
i
would
certainly
drink
again
pours
a
crisp
pale
yellow
with
a
nice
white
head
that
recedes
quickly
but
leaves
good
lacing
nose
is
slightly
skunked
malt
and
grain
taste
follows
with
good
grain
slight
skunk
a
nice
hop
kiss
and
some
good
grassy
finish
with
slight
apple
nice
and
crisp
mouthfeel
is
good
maybe
slightly
thick
drinkability
is
very
good
here
as
this
is
certainly
a
good
choice
for
a
summer
slammer
good
lager
this
is
a
good
beer
maybe
not
my
favorite
beer
from
paulaner
but
nonetheless
not
bad
at
all
taste
some
citrus
in
it
and
i
feel
the
taste
was
very
light
which
is
good
for
summer
d
way
easy
to
drink
this
would
go
with
a
variety
of
food
and
occasions
any
time
of
year
very
refreshing
very
bready
aroma
and
taste
this
is
notthing
fancy
but
is
a
damn
solid
beer
would
pair
well
with
all
sorts
of
different
foods
and
its
really
sessionable
this
is
a
good
example
of
a
german
lager
d
this
is
not
a
particularly
heavy
beer
to
me
but
has
wonderful
flavors
and
smells
if
youre
with
a
drinking
buddy
this
is
a
fine
relax
and
chat
brew
overall
i
did
not
like
this
one
i
was
unimpressed
with
it
because
of
the
other
great
beers
that
paulaner
brews
a
well
done
light
beer
though
maybe
not
the
best
well
it
was
good
and
i
would
drink
it
if
it
was
offered
but
just
not
alot
to
remember
and
it
filled
me
up
more
than
expected
for
the
style
crisp
and
refreshing
with
outstanding
drinkability
d
six
pack
worthy
by
all
means
making
for
a
great
summer
drinking
lager
which
was
crisp
and
refreshing
and
the
perfect
session
lager
on
the
palate
is
light
bodied
crisp
clean
refreshing
lager
that
focuses
towards
the
malt
but
is
nonetheless
very
light
and
refreshing
in
flavor
this
is
what
a
pale
lager
should
be
amazing
the
aroma
is
your
typical
yeasty
lager
a
bit
of
wheat
aroma
a
bit
of
grassy
hop
in
there
too
the
taste
is
a
tad
bit
lemony
grassy
a
bit
chewy
not
all
that
crisp
there
is
a
slight
honey
like
sweetness
a
touch
of
some
sourish
notes
but
both
are
very
subtle
characteristics
im
actually
getting
more
grassy
aromas
as
the
beer
settles
this
is
a
very
light
bodied
refreshing
beer
the
finish
and
aftertaste
are
both
quite
mild
this
is
a
very
nice
traditional
lager
lchaim
not
a
bad
beer
but
probably
the
worst
thing
ive
had
from
paulaner
to
date
12oz
bottle
poured
into
a
pint
glass
bottled
in
0108
clearly
noted
on
label
pours
a
pale
golden
yellow
color
with
a
lot
of
tiny
little
bubbles
rising
to
the
top
to
support
a
thin
white
head
with
sporadic
lacing
the
aroma
is
a
soft
and
clean
with
grainy
malt
and
a
touch
of
grassy
hops
the
taste
is
very
clean
and
refreshing
and
similar
to
the
aroma
with
some
grainy
malt
and
a
nice
dry
crispness
from
the
hops
the
mouthfeel
is
light
bodied
and
very
heavily
carbonated
overall
this
is
a
classic
over
and
germany
and
i
can
see
why
it
is
very
drinkable
and
would
be
great
to
enjoy
in
the
warm
outdoors
while
eating
a
bratwurst
this
is
easily
my
favorite
beer
it
has
a
nice
full
body
great
odor
and
color
and
tastes
like
heaven
this
is
what
beer
is
supposed
to
taste
like
so
its
no
surprise
that
this
beer
is
the
local
favorite
of
munich
its
a
little
diminished
bought
when
bought
in
the
states
but
nothing
can
beat
drinking
a
liter
of
this
beer
in
the
biergarten
bottle
pours
a
clear
golden
body
with
a
small
vanilla
head
that
falls
into
some
delicate
silky
lacing
aroma
is
somewhat
restrained
featuring
floral
and
spicy
hops
and
some
toasted
grain
light
medium
in
body
with
a
crisp
carbonation
taste
is
dominated
by
a
spicy
hop
bitterness
that
is
never
out
of
check
sweet
toasty
malt
sweetness
provides
an
ideal
balance
hints
of
golden
apple
fruitiness
add
interest
one
of
the
most
drinkable
lagers
in
the
world
and
a
true
classic
clean
and
pure
tough
to
argue
with
a
classic
the
beer
pours
an
inviting
straw
color
with
froathy
white
head
formation
and
very
good
retention
while
lacing
periodically
aromas
of
soft
pilsner
malts
balance
well
against
a
complementary
cereal
grain
flavor
that
doesnt
seem
to
deter
spicy
earthy
saaz
hops
are
undeniable
pungent
and
grassy
flavors
favor
the
malts
but
balanced
once
again
with
the
raw
barley
flavors
and
spicy
hop
notes
even
deep
into
the
finish
clean
and
light
on
the
palate
nearly
airy
thirst
quenching
refreshing
crisp
in
the
finish
and
a
smooth
spicy
hop
lingering
this
beer
begs
to
be
sessioned
on
these
90
degree
days
d
good
drinkability
very
refreshing
and
light
it
has
a
similar
rich
taste
and
a
full
body
it
has
strong
toasted
grain
and
bread
light
honey
sweetness
lemony
citrus
and
hint
of
pine
a
full
sweetness
is
balanced
with
pleasant
light
bitterness
to
the
end
with
a
finish
of
bread
and
hops
full
of
subtle
complexity
and
lasting
flavours
it
is
a
little
oily
very
smooth
and
incredible
drinkable
its
also
very
clean
overall
something
id
go
to
when
i
need
something
cleansing
and
easy
to
drink
nice
bite
of
carbonation
but
too
watery
for
what
i
would
like
smooth
and
nice
means
you
could
continue
on
these
however
not
my
favorite
style
by
any
means
but
a
pretty
decent
lager
for
what
it
is
drinkability
very
drinkable
because
of
the
crispness
had
at
mollys
after
my
preemployment
screen
fun
times
nice
bitters
has
a
good
solid
flavour
not
as
crisp
as
one
would
think
more
like
an
ale
in
someways
on
the
house
after
that
crap
leight
seems
to
be
a
middle
of
the
road
beer
o
nononsense
helles
lager
that
tastes
great
infinitely
more
drinkable
than
your
average
american
macro
probably
make
a
decent
session
beer
at
a
local
pub
in
germany
its
taste
is
boring
but
its
easy
to
drink
in
most
places
im
sure
you
can
find
better
though
nice
foam
as
i
poured
it
into
my
pint
glass
pale
golden
sweet
aroma
bready
and
nice
starts
with
a
sweet
malt
flavor
and
then
there
are
some
hops
to
keep
it
in
balance
although
there
could
be
more
hops
nice
aftertaste
good
as
a
session
helles
especially
on
a
summer
day
d
this
one
is
easy
to
drink
since
there
is
no
strong
taste
or
alcohol
burn
since
its
light
and
refreshing
it
can
be
drank
easily
d
what
lacks
in
other
aspects
certainly
makes
up
for
itself
if
d
crisp
and
bright
and
thirst
quenching
but
even
with
a
hard
pour
im
burpin
every
few
minutes
brilliant
old
gold
color
sweet

round

a
tangly
light
to
medium
body
with

lemon
tangerine
toast
and
golden
raisin
flavors
finishes
with
a
gentle
sweet
citurs
and
mineral
fade
not
too
bad
munich
helles
is
a
brand
that
is
certainly
losing
its
favour
even
in
its
hometown
paulaner
is
no
exception
while
this
beer
is
miles
ahead
of
most
modern
lagers
paulaner
many
decades
ago
set
the
bar
very
high
its
current
state
shows
that
it
is
evolving
into
a
euro
lager
again
not
a
bad
beer
just
a
disappointing
one
pours

crisp

with
a
rapidly

beer
not
my
favorite
helles
but
it
is
readily
obtainable
reasonably

and
goes
with
most
springsummer
fare
oelergud
d
refreshing
but
light
even
for
a
munich
hells
lager
was
hoping
for
more
from
this
beer
pours
straw
gold
with
a
short
white
head
no
real
retention
the
aroma
is
a
bit
too
mild
but
still
nice
and
appropriate
for
the
style
with
sulfur
and
pale
grains
the
flavor
however
and
this
is
why
this
style
is
so
different
from
the
american
macro
is
fullflavored
with
sweet
pale
grains
mild
hops
minerals
from
hard
water
and
lager
character
the
weihenstephaner
is
a
little
richer
but
this
is
still
a
great
beer
d
tasty
and
sessionable
lager
solid
offering
for
style
d
very
good
i
could
enjoy
having
a
few
of
these
with
dinner
and
could
even
comfortably
make
a
night
of
it
definitely
worth
a
try
excellent
drinkability
due
to
the
light
abv
and
crisp
flavor
which
was
very
refreshing
and
would
prove
to
be
quite
a
thirstquencher
on
a
hot
humid
summer
day
nice
stuff
worth
a
shot
pours
slightly
light
golden
with
decent
quickly
fading
head
smell
is
a
nice
mix
of
light
hops
and
malty
sweetness
taste
is
honey
malt
sweetness
light
to
medium
bitter
hoppiness
slightly
thin
with
a
minimal
malty
yeast
finish
to
it
overall
this
is
very
drinkable
a
very
beery
beer
and
enjoyable
although
not
really
unique
kind
of
pilsner
like
i
thought
and
i
could
drink
this
again
i
wouldnt
say
a
bad
beer
just
one
that
is
definetly
not
for
my
taste
buds
this
is
a
true
lager
what
beer
is
suppose
to
taste
like
any
one
that
likes
beer
will
like
this
it
is
a
good
strong
style
with
nothing
fancey
no
fruit
no
spice
just
beer
if
you
want
a
beer
exceptional
drinkability
you
will
love
this
if
your
still
drinking
the
likes
of
bud
and
coors
this
makes
a
great
beginner
beer
into
the
world
of
real
beer
this
brew
pours
to
a
golden
yellow
color
with
a
thick
frothy
white
head
that
had
a
low
retention
and
left
just
spotty
lacing
at
the
top
of
the
glass
the
aroma
seems
to
have
pronounced
grain
presence
sort
of
a
grass
like
smell
the
taste
goes
along
with
the
aromas
a
grainy
flavor
of
grass
seems
to
come
out
slight
sweet
feel
finishes
with
a
slight
hop
to
it
that
goes
well
not
one
of
my
favorite
brews
but
had
it
and
though
i
would
review
it
probably
a
lower
grade
for
me
than
most
just
because
i
dont
think
very
highly
of
it
not
a
brew
i
would
actively
track
down
pours
a
clear
yellowgold
with
tight
1
12
head
leaves
a
light
lace
on
side
of
glass
more
hop
aroma
and
mouthfeel
than
typical
american
lager
taste
seems
weak
and
watery
at
first
but
more
pleasant
with
each
sip
hops
are
a
little
more
predominate
than
malt
this
is
a
good
session
beer
clear
golden
appearance
nice
finger
head
that
disappears
somewhat
quickly
but
leaves
a
good
bit
of
lacing
smells
of
banana
and
some
other
fruit
i
cant
put
my
finger
on
almost
smells
too
much
like
a
weizen
maybe
its
supposed
to
and
im
missing
something
good
flavor
with
banana
gangbanging
my
tastebuds
mild
hoppy
flavor
in
the
background
but
mostly
banana
smooth
light
feel
to
it
with
a
clean
brisk
palate
great
session
beer
thats
easy
to
enjoy
all
afternoon
not
much
of
a
celebratory
beer
but
much
better
than
an
mbc
as
a
grass
cutting
beer
drinkability
a
good
lager
easy
to
drink
it
has
some
taste
but
should
appeal
to
a
macro
drinker
less
than
5
abv
its
sessionable
as
well
i
wish
there
were
more
and
better
domestics
available
like
this
as
i
stated
previously
this
is
one
of
the
fresher
oringinal
munchners
i
have
seen
and
its
three
months
old
when
you
consider
most
of
the
beer
drunk
in
the
world
is
related
to
this
style
of
beer
you
realise
that
this
is
a
very
good
example
of
the
style
one
of
the
nicest
lagers
i
have
tried
though
not
widely
available
golden
lightheaded
lager
with
many
tiny
bubble
fizzing
to
the
top
no
overpowering
aromas
jump
out
at
you
just
hints
of
the
basic
ingredients
consistant
with
the
german
purity
law
of
1516
can
be
detected
thats
how
a
basic
lager
is
supposed
to
be
thats
all
im
looking
for
here
the
taste
is
exactly
what
a
lager
is
supposed
to
be
as
well
theres
a
hint
of
bitterness
thin
and
moderately
carbonated
and
very
easy
to
drink
i
like
it
good
lager
not
as
good
as
sam
adams
but
good
appearance
is
a
golden
transparent
lager
with
2030
very
small
carbonation
bubbles
rising
from
below
poured
into
glass
with
very
slight
head
which
dissapeared
within
30
seconds
smell
is
hoppy
mildly
alcohlic
but
dissappointingly
average
i
was
not
impressed
with
taste
to
me
it
is
a
slight
step
above
miller
genuine
draft
in
terms
of
taste
mouthfeel
also
very
average
again
reminds
me
of
mgd
because
of
its
similarity
to
mgd
its
drikability
is
just
average
as
well
i
was
dissapointed
in
this
beer
as
it
was
recommended
and
i
expected
better
from
a
munich
brewer
like
paulaner
pours
a
very
light
color
of
gold
and
very
clear
the
soft
looking
white
head
grows
past
14
inch
but
then
falls
into
a
thin
layer
of
head
with
no
lacing
the
breadiness
is
very
nice
in
the
smell
aromatically
soft
and
sweet
breadiness
very
nice
the
taste
is
crisp
and
clean
with
good
breadiness
the
taste
has
fresh
bread
and
its
very
nice
the
mouthfeel
is
crisp
and
slightly
harsh
with
carbonation
but
not
by
much
overall
this
is
a
very
good
beer
and
im
glad
to
get
it
without
any
off
flavors
d
not
a
style
im
very
familiar
with
or
very
fond
of
but
this
beer
isnt
that
bad
not
that
i
thought
it
was
going
to
be
its
just
a
nice
servicable
malty
lager
nuff
said
bottled
on
0707
pours
a
pale
gold
with
a
white
head
that
hangs
around
for
a
while
bittering
hops
and
crackery
malt
make
up
for
the
smell
with
a
bit
of
honey
backing
things
up
bittering
hops
are
more
present
in
the
taste
and
call
me
crazy
but
have
a
very
green
taste
to
the
them
this
is
the
freshest
ive
had
this
beer
before
hops
up
front
and
in
the
finish
too
atop
crackery
malt
and
mild
grain
taste
honey
and
light
pear
juice
are
present
too
medium
bodied
for
a
helles
with
a
perfect
amount
of
carbonation
drinkability
is
like
givin
birth
on
labor
day
color
me
impressed
i
had
this
ontap
in
a
bistro
in
salzburg
austria
i
learned
much
about
beer
on
my
trip
to
europe
but
the
central
lesson
was
that
a
lager
can
actually
be
a
pleasurable
experience
as
opposed
to
america
where
microbreweries
are
aleheavy
and
the
only
lagers
are
along
the
lines
of
budweiser
and
pbr
and
this
was
the
best
lager
that
i
had
rich
and
bready
almost
like
a
meal
yet
with
the
smooth
drinkability
inherent
to
the
lager
style
really
something
that
has
to
be
experienced
abroad
akin
to
heineken
poured
into
a
stange
it
looks
like
your
typical
yellow
lager
with
a
dismal
head
this
brew
is
a
little
sweeter
than
your
typical
helles
lager
so
those
who
prefer
a
hoppier
lager
may
want
to
go
for
something
else
as
the
hop
flavor
is
minimal
at
best
its
a
little
light
making
it
a
good
choice
for
a
warm
day
when
you
need
something
to
wet
your
whistle
overall
refreshing
elegant
and
pleasant
beer
i
was
expecting
a
little
bit
more
body
but
i
would
like
to
have
another
one
after
drinking
both
lagers
back
to
back
this
one
wins
out
it
is
a
smooth
drink
that
goes
down
lightly
i
just
reviewed
two
beers
back
to
back
in
hopes
of
discovering
which
was
the
better
munich
helles
lager
i
reviewed
the
hackerpschorr
munich
gold
and
paulaner
original
munich
too
be
honest
i
could
not
find
a
difference
between
the
two
of
them
both
were
very
solid
and
good
beers
nothing
spectacular
honestly
there
is
such
subtle
differences
between
the
two
beers
that
i
ended
up
rating
them
exactly
the
same
so
i
tried
to
discover
which
is
better
and
im
sorry
to
report
there
is
not
much
a
difference
but
both
are
good
solid
beers
the
beer
is
quite
chilled
right
now
which
causes
it
to
be
quite
crisp
with
a
biting
bitterness
and
a
crackerlike
malt
character
at
this
temperature
the
beer
is
quite
dry
as
it
warms
up
a
bit
a
soft
though
simple
malt
sweetness
becomes
present
as
does
a
touch
of
butterscotch
the
hop
character
opens
up
a
bit
more
it
leans
towards
grassy
notes
with
perhaps
a
hint
of
lemon
zest
the
perception
of
bitterness
really
is
muted
once
the
beer
warms
up
as
well
though
it
still
provides
a
sharp
backbone
to
the
flavor
profile
somewhat
light
bodied
but
still
has
a
touch
of
structure
and
body
to
it
a
decent
beer
which
is
probably
even
better
fresh
d
i
would
be
able
to
enjoy
this
beer
for
the
better
part
of
the
evening
but
i
wouldnt
recommend
eating
a
ton
of
food
with
this
as
it
will
do
a
good
job
filling
your
stomach
up
on
its
own
very
flavorful
and
unique
id
recommend
this
one
to
anyone
looking
for
something
slightly
sweet
and
with
a
little
umph
i
really
like
their
weiss
beer
so
i
decided
to
give
this
a
try
poured
golden
yellow
with
pretty
decent
head
that
lasted
a
while
not
bad
but
no
real
characteristic
that
stood
out
very
drinkable
however
very
smooth
and
would
make
a
good
session
beer
i
had
this
on
tap
1l
mass
in
the
seehaus
beer
garden
in
munich
englischer
garten
this
was
definitely
the
best
location
to
enjoy
the
beer
in
its
own
element
as
it
were
the
beer
was
pale
yellow
straw
color
the
real
show
in
terms
of
appearance
being
the
massive
swirling
poof
of
foam
on
top
the
smell
was
light
and
malty
maybe
you
could
imagine
honey
in
the
aroma
could
be
the
color
of
the
beer
or
surroundings
that
did
that
to
me
the
flavor
was
simple
but
delicate
malt
with
a
nice
carbonation
tickle
and
a
hint
of
hops
bite
on
the
backend
just
about
right
for
the
syle
i
think
incredibly
drinkable
in
a
beautiful
beer
garden
by
a
lake
this
is
one
to
remember
fondly
d
very
good
typical
of
a
lager
of
this
type
very
refreshing
and
easy
to
drink
straightforward
what
you
see
is
what
you
get
but
a
great
example
of
the
munich
helles
lager
type
pours
a
clear
straw
color
with
a
rather
large
soapy
white
head
that
left
some
nice
rocky
lacing
the
smell
has
a
light
noble
hop
aroma
peppery
the
taste
is
very
light
but
very
refreshing
again
some
light
noble
hop
taste
and
a
light
dry
cracker
like
malt
the
feel
is
light
and
well
carbonated
no
offensive
flavors
on
the
palate
a
very
drinkable
lager
very
light
tasting
but
a
great
thirst
quencher
a
real
nice
pils
with
a
hoppy
nose
clean
crisp
finish
but
with
a
complexity
that
other
lagers
often
seem
to
miss
a
great
summer
beer
that
is
more
than
patio
fodder
i
hope
this
shows
up
in
bc
since
i
got
this
in
winnipeg
the
hops
show
up
at
just
the
right
time
to
let
you
know
that
the
brewer
knows
his
business
drinkability
found
this
beer
bland
and
disappointing
thought
i
was
drinking
a
light
beer
pours
a
fairly
light
and
perfectly
clear
strawyellow
with
a
goodsized
pure
white
head
that
lasts
reasonably
well
and
leaves
some
lacing
smell
is
clean
and
grassy
light
hops
with
some
grainy
malts
and
a
light
sweetness
as
well
nice
but
not
anything
extraordinary
taste
is
along
the
same
lines
light
noble
hops
and
a
well
done
malt
profile
but
nothing
out
of
the
ordinary
mouthfeel
is
crisp
well
carbonated
and
refreshing
and
drinkability
is
very
good
a
very
nice
lager
well
made
and
easy
to
drink
on
a
hot
day
the
taste
was
a
nice
clean
smooth
balanced
maltiness
without
a
lot
of
bitterness
dryer
than
anticipated
based
on
the
smell
a
very
crisp
easydrinking
beer
actually
the
drinkability
is
off
the
charts
im
not
going
to
seek
this
out
if
im
in
the
mood
for
intellectual
stimulation
from
my
beverage
but
it
would
sure
be
nice
to
have
a
few
more
of
these
around
on
a
warm
night
watching
a
ballgame
and
it
would
certainly
pair
well
with
a
dinner
salad
on
the
deck
not
big
enough
to
overpower
a
lighter
meal
crisp
and
easy
drinking
with
decent
balance
and
a
little
bitterness
up
front
carbonation
is
a
little
high
as
expected
but
this
finishes
smooth
and
is
an
enjoyable
session
beer
the
extra
bubbles
make
me
burp
more
than
usual
falls
down
in
the
smell
category
big
time
but
its
a
very
nice
beer
to
drink
and
would
make
a
great
session
beer
wish
i
had
bought
some
more
of
these
good
balance
crisp
finish
an
excellent
beer
refreshing
flavoursome
and
moreish
pours
a
faded
gold
with
a
foamy
head
that
subsides
eventually
lives
thick
strings
of
lacing
on
the
glass
smells
of
bready
malts
mild
grain
earthy
hops
and
a
very
mild
whiff
of
alcohol
tastes
of
light
honeyed
bread
juicy
light
fruits
and
tea
hops
body
is
solid
and
appropriately
bubbly
awesome
drinkability
this
bottle
didnt
last
but
about
5
minutes
12
oz
bottle
color
of
golden
yellow
with
a
frothy
white
head
nose
of
hay
grass
mild
floral
hopps
malt
and
slight
skunk

taste
of
bubblegum
sweet
malts
and
light
hopps
body
smooth
crisp
and
medium
carbonation

aftertaste
of
grassy
and
slight
resin
a
world
classic
that
to
me
was
better
in
the
past
i
dont
know
if
its
my
changing
tastes
or
if
it
just
isnt
made
the
same
as
it
used
to
be
or
a
combination
still
in
all
a
decent
lager
that
makes
for
an
easy
session
choice
d
i
dunno
i
was
disappointed
thankfully
it
was
my
last
of
the
evening
as
i
became
the
dd
midway
through
the
night
d
tasty
goes
down
easy
not
very
filling
good
representation
of
style
this
is
a
nice
light
and
refreshing
beer
i
could
stick
with
this
beer
for
a
while
i
normally
prefer
something
with
a
bigger
kick
but
its
a
very
good
choice
if
i
want
something
lighter
d
good
i
could
session
this
fo
sho
drinkabiliby
very
drinkable
but
not
very
impressive
hopefully
i
just
got
a
bad
bottle
its
hard
to
believe
paulaner
would
consistantly
release
a
beer
this
unimpressive
that
said
its
a
nice
easy
drinking
beer
that
would
be
good
on
a
hot
day
d
the
beautiful
taste
of
the
munich
malt
holds
a
special
place
in
my
heart
making
this
munich
helles
a
favouite
with
me
however
this
offering
is
pretty
crap
very
watery
ive
had
this
beer
drinking
from
the
bottle
in
a
munich
nightclub
which
had
more
flavour
will
get
some
more
bottle
of
it
and
rereview
i
have
had
the
urtyp
version
of
this
by
the
bottle
and
this
was
excellent
will
need
to
do
a
direct
comparison
to
find
the
true
champion
maybe
i
am
warming
up
to
this
style
who
knows
paulaner
is
a
great
beer
company
and
makes
nothing
except
top
of
the
line
beers
this
one
pours
a
rich
deep
golden
color
with
a
craggy
head
the
head
cools
down
quickly
not
leaving
much
lacing
either
smells
of
some
and
tastes
of
some
bananaorangy
flavor
with
hallertau
hops
coming
in
nicely
balancing
the
brew
a
classic
representation
of
the
style
overall
i
like
paulaner
original
münchner
and
will
recommend
it
to
my
friends
had
this
tonight
first
time
i
ever
saw
this
brand
of
brew
a
nice
straw
like
appearance
witha
bright
orangeyellow
body
similar
to
blue
moon
a
nice
whaite
head
that
is
retained
throughout
the
beer
if
you
feel
like
you
want
more
head
give
it
a
swish
and
up
it
comes
an
interesting
malty
smell
with
earthy
tones
tasted
kind
of
sweet
at
first
with
an
earthy
aftertaste
that
is
pleasant
and
lingers
in
your
mouth
i
liked
that
very
much
a
nice
thick
mouthfeel
makes
this
beer
very
drinkable
highly
recommended
it
being
served
with
a
lemon
is
nice
the
bitterness
of
the
lemon
offsets
the
earthy
tones
quite
nicely
producing
a
wellbalanced
beer
beer
was
poured
into
a
tumbler
at
50
degrees
very
pale
lager
very
normal
beer
was
very
clean
and
fresh
tasting
and
while
nothing
really
stands
out
about
the
brew
there
is
certainly
nothing
wrong
with
it
a
great
all
year
around
beer
and
it
was
great
with
the
steamed
shrimp
i
cooked
i
would
purchase
again
d
pretty
good
if
i
am
in
a
nondoppelbock
lager
mood
not
a
frequent
event
but
it
could
happen
i
might
reach
for
one
of
these
the
flavor
is
more
pronounced
that
many
nonbock
lagers
pretty
nice
this
is
the
ultimate
munich
helles
to
wash
down
some
good
bavarian
food
or
to
be
drank
in
fairly
large
quantities
however
for
a
sipping
session
brew
i
prefer
something
with
a
little
more
flavor
and
body
to
it
however
true
to
the
style
this
munich
helles
is
a
damn
good
brew
pours
a
light
yellow
color
with
little
head
crisp
clean
grainy
aroma
taste
of
light
malted
grain
with
a
slightly
sweet
flavor
followed
by
a
crisp
finish
with
a
bit
of
subtle
hoppiness
lingering
on
the
palate
an
enjoyable
tasty
lager
thats
easy
to
drink
in
the
past
couple
months
i
have
become
increasingly
fond
of
this
style
perhaps
not
coincidentally
i
think
i
may
have
finally
given
up
on
my
old
standby
brand
of
american
macro
lager
that
i
would
keep
on
hand
just
so
i
could
drink
it
cold
and
fast
and
so
munich
helles
has
stepped
in
as
my
present
light
beer
of
choice
drinkability
would
be
a
nice
keg
beer
for
a
summer
party
i
imagine
too
bad
the
basic
macro
lagers
cant
spit
out
beers
like
this
as
their
standards
near
perfect
mouthfeel
which
when
paired
with
the
straightforward
nature
of
the
taste
makes
for
an
exceptionally
drinkable
beverage
clear
pale
apple
cider
color
thin
and
bubbly
white
head
lace
is
sparse
i
love
the
thick
bready
aroma
on
this
one
slight
nuances
of
sweet
cookie
dough
and
bread
pudding
really
nice
aroma
for
this
style
taste
follows
suit
with
great
bready
malt
tones
warm
and
biscuity
rounded
sweetness
crisp
and
ever
so
slightly
dry
on
the
finish
medium
full
body
with
an
agreeable
mouthfeel
this
is
a
very
solid
helles
lager
bottle
poured
a
golden
yellow
color
lager
with
a
nice
medium
foamy
head
with
average
retention
aroma
of
floral
malt
is
light
but
pleasant
taste
is
quite
light
with
some
floral
malt
with
some
sweetness
and
a
slightly
dry
finish
with
low
hops
well
done
beer
with
limited
complexity
but
very
refreshing
mouthfeeldrinkability
there
isnt
much
to
say
about
mouthfeel
except
its
pretty
average
mellow
light
and
subtly
carbonated
it
doesnt
necessarily
improve
or
diminish
the
beers
overall
enjoyment
this
is
the
first
time
im
drinking
this
out
of
an
appropriate
glass
and
its
a
much
more
interesting
beer
effortless
and
thirstquenching
id
pair
this
with
burgers
or
common
german
cuisine
anytime
and
be
quite
content
overall
a
nicely
crafted
beer
that
does
nothing
wrong
it
leans
more
toward
a
helles
than
a
marzen
a
bit
more
malt
noble
hops
and
color
would
put
this
more
squarely
into
the
okto
category
and
give
hp
and
spaten
a
better
run
for
their
money
this
is
a
good
example
of
the
style
wellbalanced
but
a
bit
spicy
too
overall
a
lovely
crisp
clean
and
easy
drinking
premium
munich
helles
that
goes
down
all
too
easily
one
of
the
better
versions
out
there
this
should
more
widely
recognized
for
my
money
but
it
always
seems
to
get
overlooked
dont
make
that
mistake
because
this
is
a
great
munich
helles
not
to
be
missed
md
clean
not
crisp
palate
lightbodied
with
ideal
carbonation
for
a
lager
very
refreshing
and
mildlyflavoured
to
quaffbut
not
as
lively
as
draught
in
a
sense
this
is
a
very
approachable
helles
but
my
palate
tells
me
one
bottle
is
more
than
enough
it
simply
fails
to
keep
my
interest
or
focus
as
i
simply
prefer
fuller
hoppy
lagers
like
a
true
pilsner
that
said
this
beer
is
wellcrafted
for
sure
this
beer
is
all
about
tasteful
and
subdued
harmony
it
is
absoutely
a
top
notch
go
of
a
helles
lager
in
my
mind
with
no
flavor
overbearing
any
other
this
makes
this
beer
extremely
drinkable
it
would
be
quite
easy
to
get
carried
away
with
this
one
at
the
price
this
is
a
tough
sell
for
me
but
if
i
lived
in
europe
this
would
certainly
be
in
my
fridge
a
lot
i
cant
review
it
from
draught
because
it
is
some
years
since
i
last
tried
it
but
i
am
sure
the
scores
would
have
been
much
higher
d
about
as
drinkable
as
beers
get
if
youre
after
a
lager
this
would
be
a
fine
choice
overall
a
very
nice
session
beer
i
could
see
all
enjoying
of
all
the
german
munich
helles
that
are
fairly
easy
to
find
in
a
bottle
here
in
the
us
this
one
rivals
augustiner
for
my
favoriteand
is
usually
less
expensive
it
looks
marvelous
in
the
glass
bright
frothy
yellowamber
with
a
delicate
hops
smell
as
you
raise
the
glass
to
your
nose
the
taste
is
mostly
malt
with
a
nicely
balanced
bitternessfruitiness
that
makes
it
almost
irresistable
excellent
drinkability
i
think
ill
have
another
very
crisp
and
sharp
and
ridiculously
refreshing
its
not
the
most
flavorful
brew
but
there
is
nothing
at
all
offensive
about
this
beer
would
definitely
recommend
especially
on
a
hot
summer
day
like
today
when
poured
it
was
medium
light
yellow
in
color
with
very
little
foam
and
some
lace
on
the
face
of
the
glass
this
was
the
high
point
as
far
as
i
was
concerned
the
flavor
was
lack
luster
the
finish
was
so
short
that
there
was
no
flavor
what
so
ever
i
grade
this
beer
as
average
but
i
was
feeling
very
generious
i
will
never
purchase
this
brew
again
what
a
dissapointment
taste
reveals
a
hefty
and
nutty
malt
presence
and
sticky
and
oily
hops
that
balance
this
beer
out
well
theres
a
slight
unpleasant
sharp
acidic
soapiness
at
first
that
mellows
as
the
brew
warms
and
comes
into
its
own
but
nonetheless
is
there
mouthfeel
is
sparkly
and
warm
full
bodied
and
not
overcarbonated
a
decent
summer
brew
but
the
taste
leaves
just
a
little
something
to
be
desired
nonetheless
a
thirstquencher
for
this
hot
afternoon
d
like
all
well
done
german
lagers
this
one
is
a
very
quaffable
easy
drinker
very
refreshing
on
a
hot
day
there
are
better
examples
of
the
style
but
this
is
certainly
one
of
paulanders
finer
offerings
helles
is
a
difficult
style
for
me
to
judge
because
all
but
the
best
examples
seem
invariably
bland
still
i
think
paulaners
is
one
of
the
mediocre
versions
salud
ours
to
a
golden
color
with
thin
white
head
that
dissipates
quickly
and
not
much
lacing
aroma
is
mostly
hops
offsewt
slightly
by
malt
sweetness
has
a
fruity
flavor
with
an
ok
taste
and
finish
all
and
all
there
was
just
nothing
that
really
stood
out
for
me
with
this
beer
smooth
mouthfeel
very
nice
and
not
overcarbonated
very
nice
lawnmower
beer
should
be
imbibed
by
the
liter
feels
good
in
your
mouth
very
drinkable
beer
a
sweeter
lager
with
more
malt
than
paulaners
lighter
offerings
but
doesnt
really
stand
out
golden
color
and
sweet
aroma
this
is
a
beer
t
o
enjoy
on
a
warm
summer
afternoon
not
entirely
refreshing
but
better
than
mass
market
american
lagers
makes
you
want
to
have
another
and
see
if
it
really
is
a
good
session
beer
very
good
beer
although
i
was
either
not
in
the
right
mood
when
i
sampled
it
or
else
this
was
a
subpar
sixer
great
session
beer
if
you
have
the
cash
for
it
one
of
the
alltime
great
quaffables
goes
down
easy
but
doesnt
entertain
much
it
is
very
hot
for
may
in
edmonton
but
still
the
light
flavour
isnt
enough
i
wont
be
looking
for
it
again
crisp
and
refreshing
but
nothing
very
exciting
here
overall
a
very
drinkable
beer
with
pleasant
light
malt
lager
taste
and
a
refreshing
clean
finish
not
exactly
exceptional
but
a
good
beer
for
a
hot
day
and
at
4
90
abv
something
to
be
consumed
in
mass
quantities
gold
in
colour
with
medium
to
high
carbonation
aromas
of
light
malt
some
german
noble
hop
and
a
slight
touch
of
sulfur
pretty
much
your
standard
pilsner
light
malthop
combo
as
far
as
the
flavor
goes
it
could
have
used
a
bit
more
bitterness
and
hop
flavor
and
perhaps
it
lacks
a
bit
of
snap
on
the
finish
overall
this
is
an
inoffensive
but
well
made
german
lager
d
very
good

well

well

could
easily
be
a

in

this
and
paulaners
other
offerings
make
for
terrific

beers
for
any
bas
fridge
overall
even
at
6
months
its
not
a
bad
drop
taste
is
highly
malt
based
with
nay
a
hint
of
hops
mouthfeel
is
smooth
with
a
minimal
amount
of
carbonation
a
drinkable
and
respectable
beer
but
nothing
to
write
home
about
something
more
in
the
aftertaste
but
not
too
much
a
little
watery
pours
a
clear
pale
gold
with
a
very
small
foamy
mostly
diminishing
head
some
decent
lacing
it
has
a
rather
typical
euro
smell
with
light
perfumey
hops
over
moderate
lightly
toasted
grains
the
taste
is
clean
and
crisp
with
a
nicely
dry
finish
but
its
a
bit
on
the
bland
side
even
for
the
style
it
has
a
mediumlight
body
watery
texture
and
low
carbonation
i
was
not
impressed
with
this
one
at
all
its
rather
blah

definitely
not
worth
the
money
beer
pours
a
light
yellow
with
a

light
german

in

and
a

the

too
timid
and
mild
to
be
a
good
munich
helles
note
the
bottle
that
i
used
to
rate
this
ive
had
in
my
fridge
for
a
while
now
however
it
tastes
the
same
way
that
i
remember
the
palate
features
perhaps
a
bit
too
much
hop
bitterness
and
throws
off
the
delicate
balance
that
i
appreciate
in
this
style
there
are
also
creamy
malt
and
lime
peel
present
but
not
at
the
level
that
this
bitterness
would
require
still
it
is
a
nice
beer
that
stands
up
to
multiple
beer
sessions

hell
yeah
when
theyre

otherwise
not

im
thumping
myself
to
think
that
ive
never
tried
this
before
if
ever
im
in
the
mood
for
a
good
smooth
utterly
untroubling
lager
this
would
be
my
choice
this
one
at
first
didnt
sit
well
with
mea
bit
too
sweet

through
i

to

the

overall
this
is
what
a
lager
should
taste
like
an
excellent
very

beer
recommended
i
really
enjoyed
this
beer
for
what
a
lager
is
supposed
to
be
this
lived
up
to
it
in
almost
every
way
except
the
smell
is
a
bit
uninviting
with
sour
being
the
leading
power
poured
in
a
tulip
duvel
glass
it
had
a
nice
head
that
quickly
faded
and
little

is
fairly
bold
for
a
lager
wheatyeast
apparent
and
the
finish
completely
wipes
the
palate
clean
with
a
lemon
slighty
sour
finish
that
makes
the
drinkability
high
every
drink
your
starting
fresh

is

there
is
minimal
foam
and
almost
no

aroma
is
that

compliments
the
initial
taste

consists
of
roasted

grab

overall

how

it
tasted
similar
to
boddingtons

i
enjoyed

a

notes
every

i
try
this

on

at

it

i
have
had
better
in

past
from

not
one
id
buy
outright
but
not
terrible
overall
this
one
is
nice
and
refreshing
a
great

brew
one
i
will
certainly
get
again
an
infinitely
sessionable
and
wonderfully
nuanced
lager
maybe
the
best
offering
from
penn
in
terms
of
session
candidates
pairs
great
with
a
wide
range
of
foods
but
tastes
good
enough
to
drink
on
its

excellent

definitely
a
beer
i
will
return

helles
with
plenty

nice
to

lager
every

thanks
for
representing
my
home
state
with
the
name
of
your
wonderful
brewery
this
is
what
beer
is
supposed
to
be
a
straight
up
no
pretense
beer
damn
good
put
this
up
there
with
victory
lager
in
terms
of
a
pure
beer
some
of
the
best
beers
in
the
world
come
out
of
pennsylvania
pours
a
clean
yellow
color
with
a
white
head
in
the
aroma
a
sweet
malt
and
fresh
lager
notes
in
the
taste
a
small
sweet
lager
notes
quite
fresh
and
a
bit
watery
a
very
small
bite
but
mainly
smooth
and
a
light
bodied
mouthfeel
with
a
small
and
dry
graininess
in
the
aftertaste
quite
fresh
yet
a
bit
sweet
nice
but
just
about
average
wow
this
one
way
surpassed
my
expectations
when
i
first
poured
it
i
expected
it
to
have
a
macro
watery
taste
but
i
was
truly
blow
away
by
the
flavor
of
this
beer
this
beer
is
able
to
be
extremely
light
across
the
palate
and
yet
has
a
great
flavor
quite
possibly
the
most
drinkable
beer
i
have
ever
had
due
to
being
overall
light
in
body
full
in
flavor
and
low
in
alcohol
percentage
very
sessionable
beer
in
one
of
my
favorite
styles
im
lucky
enough
at
the
moment
to
live
in
pittsburgh
where
germanic
and
east
european
heritage
has
rubbed
off
on
local
breweries
like
the
pennsylvania
brewing
company
and
church
brew
works
they
both
make
nice
germanstyle
lagers
i
hope
to
see
more
lagers
from
american
craft
companies
overall
one
of
the
best
i
have
ever
encountered
good
flavor
medium
bodied
and
sessionable
would
consider
trying
it
again
in
the
bottle
to
see
if
its
as
good
md
mouthfeel
is
very
light
and
smooth
but
watery
very
drinkable
in
the
same
way
all
very
light
beers
are
drinkable
would
be
a
good
substitute
for
a
bmc
not
an
absolute
behemoth
beer
and
not
one
to
get
all
excited
about
by
beer
geeks
but
truly
a
wonderful
take
on
the
helles
style
lager
d
very
easy
drinking
beer
well
balanced
low
abv
you
could
drink
quite
a
few
of
these
but
there
is
just
not
enough
here
for
me
to
buy
again
and
again
good
but
not
fantastic
dthe
beer
is
balanced
and
has
a
good
flavor
reminiscent
of
the
established
german
munich
helles
beers
its
lighter
body
and
good
balance
of
flavor
makes
is
a
very
good
session
beer
drinkable
and
at
4
abv
easy
to
pack
away
a
few
a
good
brew
no
complaints
sweetness
clings
to
the
mouth
early
but
the
aggressive
carbonation
scrubs
the
malts
and
grains
off
of
the
tongue
the
acidity
helps
with
the
crispness
along
with
the
carbonation
but
that
co2
and
sulfur
texture
scratches
a
bit
in
the
end
drinkability
was
good
penn
gold
has
a
pleasing
flavor
and
a
very
low
abv
you
could
drink
these
all
day
pours
a
very
clear
golden
color
with
a
thin
white
head
slight
hop
spiced
aroma
blends
with
some
maltiness
and
a
touch
of
butter
it
is
a
subtle
nose
but
quite
pleasant
very
drinkable
beer
with
a
crisp
finish
tastes
include
grain
malt
and
slight
bitter
hops
to
balance
it
out
medium
feel
and
moderate
to
light
carb
it
is
simple
yet
good
enough
to
want
and
sit
down
and
have
a
few
of
i
poured
this
beer
into
my
tumbler
at
45
degrees
the
beer
had
a
nonexisting
head
and
was
a
nice
gold
color
the
beer
had
a
bit
of
a
fruity
smell
the
beer
i
think
was
old
as
it
was
a
bit
flat
tasting
it
had
a
slightly
bitter
finish
i
was
not
impressed
and
will
not
buy
again
maybe
the
beer
was
old
or
a
bad
example
i
plan
to
try
again
to
give
a
fair
shake
overall
as
a
fan
of
the
style
i
would
prefer
a
bit
more
of
everything
as
this
seems
to
almost
be
a
helles
lager
light
pours
an
orange
copper
color
with
a
slight
head
the
smell
is
a
little
faint
but
has
the
presence
of
sweet
malt
and
some
sweet
breads
the
overall
taste
is
a
little
weak
as
well
there
is
a
grain
and
sweet
malt
backbone
with
some
bread
taste
and
a
faint
citrus
hop
the
mouthfeel
is
of
moderate
carbonation
overall
this
is
an
average
beer
you
can
drink
one
or
two
but
no
more
d
well
really
easy
to
get
down
especially
if
im
eating
food
with
it
can
drink
these
all
day
moreys
bottom
line
to
give
this
beer
a
fair
shake
ill
likely
edit
this
review
down
the
road
after
ive
had
the
chance
to
explore
the
style
a
bit
more
good
but
to
me
its
not
living
up
to
its
reputation
i
had
stoudts
helles
a
few
weeks
ago
and
i
enjoyed
it
a
bit
more
very
much
worth
trying
but
not
a
run
to
the
store
immediately
beer
n
a
nice
helles
lager
but
a
bit
too
adjunctlike
all
in
all
a
good
choice
but
could
use
a
little
tweaking
drinkability
im
not
exactly
sure
what
i
should
be
looking
for
with
this
style
but
this
was
extremely
easy
to
drink
i
wish
there
was
more
flavor
and
a
longer
finish
but
i
could
easily
drink
a
few
of
these
no
problem
this
is
a
very
easy
drinker
also
quite
refreshing
it
would
be
easy
to
drink
a
bunch
of
these
tm
this
is
an
absolute
thirst
quencher
clean
fresh
delicious
light
bodied
with
a
nice
carbonation
to
boot
sweet
on
the
front
provided
by
the
malts
and
a
slight
bitter
back
end
with
the
hops
again
nothing
overpowering
just
a
fine
mix
of
two
a
beer
with
just
the
purest
flavors
it
should
put
the
macros
out
of
business
i
know
like
my
words
arent
doing
this
justicebut
it
was
damn
good
i
think
the
subtleties
were
a
bit
past
my
depth
honestly
i
do
know
that
despite
my
lack
of
appropriate
words
this
beer
was
really
good
and
ill
be
having
more
a
very
refreshing
lager
smooth
malts
with
a
good
amount
of
balancing
hops
really
hit
the
spot
on
a
warm
spring
afternoon
very
easy
drinking
beer
especially
on
a
hot
day
like
today
d
could
drink
the
whole
12pack
on
a
sunny
day
by
the
pool
good
authentic
german
style
beer
with
a
fresh
taste
and
no
gimmicks
nice
golden
color
head
was
a
little
thin
out
of
bottle
may
have
better
head
on
draft
a
relatively
simple
beer
with
no
complex
flavors
a
great
beer
to
pair
with
brats
also
a
fine
beer
for
a
hot
summers
day
something
i
could
definitely
see
being
a
safe
goto
beer
if
it
were
more
available
in
my
area
great
for
parties
or
introducing
macro
beer
drinkers
to
the
craft
world
not
a
whole
lot
not
to
like
about
this
beer
in
the
past
ive
paired
this
beer
with
homemade
buffalo
wings
and
would
definitely
recommend
it
d
keep
em
coming
drinkability
is
pretty
huge
tasty
and
mild
enough
that
you
could
drink
it
all
night
2nd
from
penn
that
ive
had
after
st
nicholaus
brewers
reserve
and
i
conclude
they
are
an
excellent
brewery
pours
a
nice
golden
color
go
figure
its
a
golden
lager
nice
luxurious
head
and
plenty
of
body
16oz
chilled
pint
glass
nice
lacing
mouthfeel
is
exceptional
im
saying
this
cause
i
like
it
when
a
lager
is
impressive
bitterness
and
maltiness
are
perfectly
balanced
this
is
a
real
german
style
lager
low
alcohol
makes
it
easy
to
drink
a
few
and
taste
makes
it
totally
possible
as
well
think
this
is
worth
a
brewery
visit
d
very
drinkable
beer
the
flavor
is
nicely
balanced
and
not
too
powerful
and
the
abv
makes
this
a
great
all
night
drinker
penn
definitely
knows
their
lagers
drinkability
what
is
it
with
pennsylvania
brewing
and
their
noteperfect
germanstyle
beers
i
loved
penn
weizen
and
i
like
this
quite
a
bit
wonder
if
they
brew
a
dopplebock
penn
gold
is
a
solid
pale
lager
that
is
probably
ubiquitous
within
50
miles
of
the
brewery
western
pennsylvanians
probably
drink
a
lot
of
this
stuff
in
the
final
reckoning
twelve
ounces
was
just
enough
to
convince
me
that
the
flavor
score
deserves
an
increase
bottom
line
no
frills
just
good
beer
i
has
a
very
pale
yellow
color
which
is
slightly
cloudy
it
has
a
large
head
the
aroma
is
very
clean
with
a
hint
of
bread
and
sweet
malt
it
starts
with
a
nice
biting
carbonation
there
is
a
lot
of
malt
sweetness
in
it
oddly
id
say
corn
although
i
know
they
dont
use
corn
in
their
brewing
i
also
get
a
bit
of
lemon
and
slight
bread
the
finish
is
clean
with
a
little
hops
but
definitely
lots
of
sweetness
very
light
and
drinkable
overall
lagers
are
not
my
thing
but
there
are
a
few
that
are
real
good
and
this
is
one
of
them
if
i
were
to
session
any
beer
i
would
probably
pick
this
d
excellent
a
wonderfully
flavorful
yet
modest
beer
without
any
offensive
characteristics
penn
gold
is
definitely
something
i
would
purchase
in
quantity
in
the
future
will
never
buy
again
but
would
like
to
taste
it
again
to
see
if
it
was
really
skunked
or
not
this
beer
sure
is
drinkable
a
great
session
beer
balance
of
the
bitterness
from
the
hops
and
sweetness
of
the
malt
keeps
it
from
becoming
too
boring
crisp
smooth
body
with
a
dry
finish
makes
you
want
to
take
another
sip
great
lager
single
from
whole
foods
raleigh
not
a
carbon
copy
of
the
munich
originals
but
possibly
just
as
good
in
its
own
way
drinkability
this
is
a
near
five
on
drinkability
as
a
lawnmower
beer
which
it
is
it
has
amazing
poundability
factor
smooth
and
very
drinkable
i
would
get
this
again
and
not
put
so
much
age
on
it
next
time
pretty
easy
and
drinkable
i
guess
a
nice
german
lager
session
beer
but
nothing
exceptional
to
make
me
return
to
it
d
another
solid
offering
from
penn
definetly
worth
trying
if
youre
nearby
but
not
one
to
go
out
of
your
way
for
penns
definetly
a
solid
brewery
doing
a
good
job
providing
affordable
classic
style
brews
drinkability
is
through
the
roof
one
of
the
most
neutral
but
still
flavorful
session
brews
around
it
never
gets
old
and
it
goes
well
with
pretty
much
anything
foodwise
one
of
my
favorite
renditions
of
the
style
poured
into
a
glass
from
the
12oz
bottle
lovely
medium
lasting
head
over
a
pale
amber
body
smells
of
hops
and
malt
in
balance
neither
overpowers
the
other
and
the
taste
is
the
same
although
the
hops
bitterness
seems
to
linger
at
the
back
of
the
palate
way
after
the
malt
taste
theres
a
good
body
a
little
creaminess
perhaps
with
some
light
carbonation
and
a
slightly
dry
finish
this
is
a
good
beer
with
or
without
food
an
excellent
drinkin
brew
the
hops
give
this
grainy
malty
taste
some
needed
balance
with
notes
of
spice
and
medium
bitterness
the
texture
is
light
and
juicy
and
presumably
quite
refreshing
overall
this
is
genuine
quality
german
style
drinking
beer
and
i
would
pick
up
a
sixer
if
i
saw
one
starting
to
get
very
hard
to
find
in
my
area
easy
drinker
if
they
could
up
the
aroma
a
bit
it
would
be
top
notch
bottoms
up
perhaps
i
am
being
overly
critical
of
this
beer
as
i
have
enjoyed
the
others
i
have
reviewed
from
this
brewery
and
expected
the
same
with
this
one
this
is
a
good
beer
just
not
the
quality
i
have
come
to
expect
from
penn
brewing
d
very
drinkable
would
make
a
great
ontap
session
d
an
allaround
great
lager
very
enjoyable
in
the
spring
and
summer
definitely
a
refreshing
beer
all
in
all
and
i
could
recommend
it
for
sure
its
not
really
my
style
though
so
it
may
be
a
while
before
i
purchase
another
one
for
myself
o
maybe
not
my
first
pick
but
i
think
this
beer
achieves
the
clean
bright
flavor
associated
with
the
style
drinkability
another
eay
quaffing
brew
from
pbc
flavor
profile
is
mellow
but
pleasant
mouthfeel
is
good
good
helles
lagers
have
a
pillowy
soft
mouthfeel
and
a
little
crispness
this
one
fits
the
bill
drinkability
is
excellent
this
is
an
ideal
summertime
session
beer
mouthfeel
is
sudsy
and
light
a
bit
thin
overall
a
very
refreshing
brew
but
not
as
tasty
as
i
thought
itd
be
slightly
cloudy
appearance
in
a
pint
glass
with
a
very
faint
aroma
and
a
very
clean
finish
a
much
better
summer
beer
than
a
lot
of
what
is
out
there
and
not
so
robust
so
that
you
might
be
able
to
convince
some
of
the
light
beer
guzzlers
to
give
it
a
try
i
have
a
feeling
this
beer
will
see
many
springs
and
summers
with
me
drinkability
a
fine
example
of
the
style
goes
down
great
on
a
hot
day
floral
notes
are
present
throughout
this
beer
very
easy
to
drink
and
i
can
imagine
myself
in
the
biergartens
that
the
back
of
the
bottle
speas
of
clear
pale
yellow
under
a
pure
white
head
lacing
all
the
way
down
the
glass
clean
pilsner
malt
sweetness
in
the
aroma
balanced
with
a
mild
noble
hoppiness
soft
pale
malt
flavor
with
a
touch
of
grassy
hops
light
clean
and
simple
i
could
drink
many
on
a
toasty
day
in
the
sun
or
any
time
i
suppose
final
thought
this
was
definitely
a
suspectskunked
bottle
and
the
beer
will
be
reviewed
at
a
later
time
ive
had
a
case
of
this
before
and
dont
recall
this
backlash
from
the
brew
this
is
a
very
tasty
drinkable
brew
i
dont
often
reach
for
a
lager
but
if
i
wanted
a
good
one
this
would
definitely
hit
the
mark
pours
a
slightly
hazy
golden
straw
color
with
no
head
formation
whatsoever
even
with
aggressive
swirling
dirty
glass
in
the
nose
i
first
get
hints
of
hallertau
hops
a
little
bit
of
cooked
corn
slight
butter
but
overall
quite
clean
on
the
palate
its
light
pils
malt
all
the
way
with
a
nice
grainy
flavor
finishing
with
a
floral
note
from
the
hops
a
medium
low
body
without
a
strong
carbonation
level
make
this
an
easy
quaffer
however
id
have
to
say
there
isnt
a
strong
enough
supporting
role
for
the
hops
to
make
this
one
id
pick
up
again
this
is
a
very
drinkable
lager
as
the
first
ive
had
from
this
brewery
its
a
good
sign
pours
a
slightly
foggy
straw
gold
nice
crème
head
nose
is
uneventful
cant
seem
to
pull
anything
off
of
it
flavor
is
pretty
grain
toned
seems
to
be
a
steady
and
consistent
with
nice
thick
malt
character
to
it
feel
is
good
on
the
liquid
and
the
same
on
the
carbonation
overall
very
drinkable
well
made
and
goes
down
fairly
easy
though
the
body
is
a
bit
thicker
than
the
standard
boring
old
lager
i
cant
say
i
would
go
for
it
again
not
my
style
but
it
is
definitely
well
made
i
feel
that
this
is
a
clean
wellbalanced
beer
but
nothing
spectacular
i
would
definately
have
another
as
i
find
it
quite
drinkable
a
consistent
goto
beer
but
doesnt
stand
out
take
it
for
what
its
worth
ill
say
the
aroma
is
delicate
alright
it
fades
after
a
few
minutes
at
first
its
a
beautiful
citrus
rind
herb
and
farmhouse
funk
but
that
fades
to
a
creamy
orange
smell
the
flavor
is
a
bit
bland
but
still
nice
it
finishes
with
a
smooth
pale
grain
taste
while
the
main
taste
has
a
typical
lager
tang
with
a
semisweet
apple
but
the
overall
flavor
is
clean
and
almost
pure
unlike
the
pale
euro
lagers
that
are
mass
produced
there
are
better
munich
lagers
but
this
is
still
a
nice
example
overall
a
very
tasty
munich
lager
smooth
and
crisp
yet
flavorful
highly
drinkable
recommended
clear
straw
gold
with
a
bright
white
head
composed
of
fine
bubbles
the
foam
settled
quickly
but
left
some
lacing
behind
aromas
of
sweet
malt
were
accompanied
by
a
light
fruityspicy
character
and
a
hint
of
lemon
delicate
bitterness
balanced
on
the
sweet
side
with
ample
malts
and
mild
lemony
hops
the
finish
went
by
very
quickly
light
bodied
with
moderate
carbonation
a
little
thin
in
the
finish
very
easy
drinking
with
some
pleasant
character
solid
penn
gold
is
balanced
and
refreshing
its
not
extreme
in
any
sense
of
the
word
its
the
type
of
beer
thats
not
going
to
scare
the
bud
drinker
but
its
not
gonna
wow
the
hopheaded
beer
geek
its
a
solid
lager
d
great
i
could
session
and
enjoy
this
all
day
i
will
get
this
one
again
i
would
have
this
againvery
good
for
the
summer
and
refreshing
well
this
is
ok
but
really
i
was
expecting
more
on
the
plus
side
though
there
isnt
anything
bad
at
all
about
this
lager
it
is
just
rather
mild
mannered
and
lacking
in
anything
different
or
outstanding
of
what
an
good
lager
should
do
its
a
bright
bright
gold
with
barely
any
head
leaves
little
lacing
there
is
a
slight
hop
aroma
but
not
much
at
all
what
it
is
is
rather
spicy
there
is
a
little
bit
of
grainy
flavor
that
is
some
what
sweet
very
easy
to
drink
the
mouth
feel
is
rather
bland
simple
and
rather
slick
overall
its
a
nice
beer
but
nothing
spectacular
scent
was
little
to
none
there
was
a
malt
smell
but
very
light
head
formed
and
cleared
quickly
with
small
amount
of
carbonation
and
very
little
lace
looked
like
a
typical
burp
beer
to
me
the
mouth
was
likewise
nothing
to
write
about
average
hops
were
barely
detectable
and
wash
was
clean
well
for
flavor
i
had
to
check
that
this
wasnt
a
light
beer
i
let
it
marm
a
bit
on
my
palette
and
found
trace
amounts
of
malt
slight
alcohol
and
they
say
this
is
a
pure
barley
beverage
all
i
have
to
say
is
clean
ill
agree
that
the
taste
is
as
light
and
clean
and
refreshing
it
would
be
a
good
hot
weather
beer
so
would
i
get
this
again
not
really
if
it
were
on
special
or
someone
gave
it
to
me
id
accept
because
its
so
light
its
really
easy
to
drink
other
than
that
i
want
more
flavor
in
my
beers
i
got
this
on
tap
at
tanks
taproom
in
tampa
fl
it
poured
very
little
head
that
had
a
nice
slow
retention
there
was
thin
to
no
lacing
the
color
was
a
deep
gold
the
smell
had
an
odd
sweet
aroma
something
that
i
know
i
have
smelled
before
but
i
cannot
place
the
taste
was
the
same
as
the
smell
but
better
blended
the
mouthfeel
was
an
excelent
smooth
feeling
all
in
all
a
fair
drink
dont
drink
and
review
i
am
very
surprised
at
how
much
i
enjoyed
this
one
i
am
not
crazy
about
this
syle
at
all
pours
a
rich
golden
color
with
a
fizzy
head
disapating
to
nothing
leaves
no
tracing
that
is
all
that
is
well
average
the
taste
is
great
light
bodied
with
some
toasty
buttery
oatness
with
some
true
tettenang
hops
to
balance
out
the
sweet
maltiness
a
well
balanced
and
heck
as
good
as
any
other
of
the
syle
ive
tried
12oz
bottle
poured
a
pale
golden
color
with
very
little
head
and
almost
no
lacing
not
much
in
the
scent
but
some
sweet
malt
and
a
slight
hop
aroma
taste
of
sweet
grain
malt
with
just
a
bite
of
fresh
hops
the
mouth
feel
is
light
to
medium
not
as
watery
as
it
looked
more
of
a
hot
summer
beer
than
a
fallwinter
brew
very
good
beer
slightly
better
imo
than
the
pilsner
d
in
the
day
of
big
bold
imperial
ales
this
beer
suffers
from
lack
of
alcohol
and
big
bold
hops
this
beer
gets
back
to
fundamentals
and
nails
them
the
malts
are
biscuity
and
sweet
and
go
down
very
smoothly
the
drinkability
is
quite
good
sessionable

very
fine
well
rounded

overall
i
was
not
entirely
impressed
with
penn

it
is
a
decent
lager
that
really
does
not
have
anything
that
makes
it
stand
out
against
the
rest
overall
a
drinkable
straightforward
brew
that
is
as
refreshing
as
it
is

good
accompaniment
to
any
light
meal
notes
impressive
tough
to
find
a
really
good
munich
helles
lager
but
the
bus
can
stop
here
was
a
joy
to
sit
down
to
this
as
an
after
work
relaxing
beer
on
a
hot
summer
day
add
this
to
your
shopping
if
you
can
get
it
poured
from
the
bottle
a
nice
light
gold
with
a
small
and
tight
head
that
didnt
stick
around
too
long
smell
was
average
fairly
light
with
malt
dominating
some
mild
hops
malt
again
was
the
prevailing
flavor
on
the
tongue
and
it
was
the
carbonation
that
dominated
the
mouthfeel
which
was
light
very
crisp
and
again
carbonated
beer
was
pretty
drinkable
enjoyed
a
few
back
to
back
overall
much
cleaner
than
the
previous
bottle
of
penn
pilsner
which
i
sampled
earlier
i
noticed
that
this
is
brewed
within
the
reinheitsgebot
laudable
i
enjoyed
this
one
rather
quaffable
too
a
solid
münchener
helles
very
drinkable
and
contradicting
it
a
harsh
acidic
lemon
finish
noticeable
hops
and
light
yellow
with
a
decent
head
hoppy
like
a
pale
ale
more
bitter
than
sweet
perhaps
some
corn
in
there
medium

cheers
a
fine
example
of
an
all
purpose
beer
suitable
for
any
gathering
poured
a
straw
yellow
color
with
a
small
head
of
foam
that
dissipated
fast
that
very
few
rings
around
the
glass
the
best
part
of
the
appearance
was
that
i
saw
all
those
carbonation
bubbles
rising
to
the
top
of
the
pilsner
glass
the
aroma
was
that
of
what
smelled
like
sour
malt
or
hops
but
it
you
swirled
it
around
a
grainy
smell
emerges
the
taste
was
very
grainy
with
a
slight
hoppy
aftertaste
it
was
too
grainy
for
my
taste
buds
the
mouthfeel
was
pretty
much
average
clean
crisp
and
with
some
carbonation
this
made
for
a
nice
affordable
lager
and
thats
it
nothing
too
special
and
although
somewhat
ok
this
was
the
worst
beer
out
of
the
variety
pack
not
the
best
beer
from
penn
brewery
very
easy
to
drink
but
it
reminds
me
of
budweiser
a
bit
which
i
dont
really
dig
on
this
isnt
my
favorite
style
but
it
was
worth
a
try
not
a
bad
session
beer
though
if
you
like
the
style
if
helles
lagers
are
your
thing
this
one
is
worth
a
try
drinkability
is
ok
considering
this
is
not
my
favorite
choice
from
penn
i
found
that
this
beer
was
just
ok
penn
gold
poured
to
a
more
hazy
golden
color
rather
than
crystal
clear
a
nice
white
head
full
of
carbonation
with
great
lace
down
the
side
of
my
glass
average
taste
but
it
didnt
have
the
crispness
that
i
found
with
other
beers
of
this
style
good
body
with
and
ok
finish
drinkability
it
was
pretty
good
and
refreshing
i
had
this
beer
during
a
pirates
game
at
pnc
park
it
was
also
a
very
good
thing
to
find
local
micros
there
and
helped
me
out
to
avoid
bmc
awful
macros
also
its
price
was
about
the
same
thing
than
the
others
brands
sold
on
location
if
i
got
the
opportunity
i
would
drink
it
again
penn
gold
pours
a
slightly
hazy
golden
color
topped
by
a
white
foamy
head
which
produces
some
light
lacing
there
are
streams
of
bubbles
coming
from
the
bottom
the
smell
is
sweet
malt
with
hints
of
straw
and
just
a
whiff
of
lemon
the
taste
is
really
refreshing
and
clean
it
is
marked
by
a
strong
slightly
sweet
and
bready
malt
character
with
a
tinge
of
lemon
the
aftertaste
produces
a
light
bitter
feeling
in
the
back
of
the
mouth
mouthfeel
is
light
refreshing
but
possibly
a
bit
more
carbonated
than
id
like
this
is
pretty
good
lager
and
is
easy
to
drink
and
tastes
better
than
any
macro
beer
is
good
happy
beering
enjoyed
this
beer
on
tap
at
their
brewery
this
poured
a
clean
deep
golden
color
the
aroma
has
a
chalky
maltiness
about
it
the
taste
is
wonderfully
clean
and
crisp
soft
malts
and
floral
hops
meld
together
flawlessly
and
finish
with
a
slightly
winey
lemony
finish
overall
a
very
nice
smooth
and
clean
tasting
beer
drinkability
fantastic
would
make
a
superb
beer
to
have
a
few
of
one

more
robust

the
flavor
would
lead
you
to
believe
beers
with
such
a
delicate
and
balanced
taste
are
usually
a
bit
thin
but
this
one
stands
up
well
drinkability
is
good
as
this
beer
is
enjoyable
and
easy
going
the
hops
talk
back
just
a
bit
more
than
youd
expect
which
hurts
drinkability
a
bit
over
all

very
good
beer
that
surpasses
most
lighter
lagers
in
taste
and
body
another
good
example
of
an
authentically
styled
german
beer
from
penn
brewing
as
the
name
entails
it
pours
a
crystal
clear
golden
hue
with
a
nice
full
white
head
reading
the
description
of
this
beer
on
the
back
makes
it
that
more
enticing
the
hallertau
hops
have
an
almost
biscuit
like
aroma
and
the
malt
sweetness
diffuses
into
my
senses
along
with
the
hops
very
pleasant
and
mild
aroma
here
a
crisp
refreshing
maltiness
along
with
a
unique
yeast
flavor
the
hops
give
the
overall
flavor
a
light
rolling
bitterness
that
blends
perfectly
with
the
rest
of
whats
going
on
lighter
body
but
its
perfect
for
this
munchner
helles
style
lager
very
drinkable
maybe
too
drinkable
making
this
beer
one
great
session
beer
the
penn
gold
poured
a
light
tan
color
with
an
almost
clear
appearance
lots
of
active
carbonation
bands
rose
quickly
to
the
small
creamy
head
some
lacing
was
noticed
but
not
too
much
a
nice
fruity
aroma
greeted
the
nose
along
with
some
sweet
malt
and
a
vague
lemon
scent
i
was
very
impressed
with
the
golds
taste
nice
malt
presence
thats
somewhat
dominated
by
the
hallertau
at
first
but
makes
a
recovery
during
the
swallow
towards
the
end
a
strange
but
invigorating
lemoncreamy
taste
made
an
appearance
followed
some
bitterness
very
nice
interplay
here
great
taste
the
lighter
mouthfeel
was
also
pleasing
and
very
appropriately
smooth
penn
gold
has
great
session
qualities
very
drinkable
with
a
wonderful
taste
my
new
favorite

notes
drinkable
to
say
the
least
three

from

1993
1998
enough
said
a
great
lunch
time
beer
goes
well
with
rubens
or
roastbeef
on
dark
rye
expected
more
from
surly
not
one
of
their
perfect
summery
type
beer
good
head
lite
in
color
o
a
nice
interpretation
of
the
style
sweet
corn
bread
very
smooth
perfect
yard
work
beer
fantastic
its
ok
just
not
my
favorite
style
its
right
on
what
i
expect
a
helles
lager
to
be
clear
golden
body
with
an
inch
of
white
head
aromas
of
fruity
esters
corn
lager
yeast
light
and
fruity
mild
sweetness
finishing
with
a
dash
of
hop
bitterness
easy
drinking
solid
good
light
pale
ale
no
happy
after
taste
i
like
it
perfect
for
grilling
or
a
latenight
session
when
one
just
needs
a
little
refreshment
is
it
superb
nobut
it
is
supremely
drinkable
as
promised
and
light
without
sacrificing
substance
truly
lagerly
without
ever
falling
into
heavy
fruitiness
not
surlys
most
unique
beer
but
a
welldone
sessionable
drinker
sweet
and
drinkable
this
is
one
helluva
beer
poured
into
a
pokal
a
clear
somewhat
dull
lighter
golden
with
a
nice
thick
white
crown
atop
all
malts
in
the
nose
with
a
tinge
of
ironjust
a
faint
leafy
hop
aroma
is
detected
smooth
and
drinkable
with
toasted

well
with
some
pork
shanks
and

in

and
a

nice

of
bready

faint
grassy
notes
something
a
bit
floral
too
taste
follows
the
nose
with
the
bready
biscuity
taste
even
more
pronounced
this
is
a
great
summer
brew
and
a
refreshing
break
from
the
intensely
hopped
ales
im
often
pulled
towards
i
dont
have
access
to
enough
good
helles
or
zwickels
to
be
sure
about
how
this
holds
up
against
the
best
in
class
but
this
is
miles
better
than
the
macro
lagers
interesting
like
a
typical
american
crap
commercial
brew
but
with
a
twist
slight
resiny
hops
in
the
background
a
fresher
and
cleaner
build
on
the
malts
compared
to
say
a
coors
but
still
a
little
bit
of
pisswater
taste
but
thats
not
always
bad
particularly
on
a
warm
summer
day
after
mowing
the
lawn
just
not
now
or
today
after
a
mastermind
and
a
zombie
dust
i
suppose
it
kind
of
takes
me
back
to
my
local
barcantina
late
at
night
looking
for
some
ugly
hooch
for
a
quick
bed
ive
heard
great
things
about
surly
its
a
shame
this
is
my
first
go
at
one
of
their
brews
another
surly
first
for
me
thanks
to
my
main
man
vdubb
this
stuff
pours
a
slightly
hazy
straw
topped
by
a
finger
or
so
of
lightly
offwhite
foam
the
nose
comprises
light
grass
mild
biscuit
light
dried
honey
mild
flowers
and
the
faintest
notion
of
hard
water
the
taste
brings
in
more
of
the
same
with
a
stronger
contingent
of
both
grass
and
flowers
if
i
didnt
know
any
better
id
say
this
was
an
american
take
on
a
czech
pils
rather
than
a
helles
lager
whatever
the
body
is
fairly
light
with
a
light
moderate
carbonation
and
a
wet
feel
overall
an
enjoyable
drink
no
matter
the
style
the
surly
hell
is
ok
nothing
spectacular
in
my
humble
opinion
the
beer
poured
a
clear
golden
with
thin
white
head
that
is
not
leaving
much
of
a
lace
the
scent
is
very
faint
if
at
all
maybe
some
bittering
hops
the
taste
has
biscuit
with
touches
of
grass
and
peat
the
mouthfeel
is
medium
in
body
with
good
carbonation
overall
this
is
a
good
session
beer
o
this
is
a
nice
sessionable
beer
that
is
clean
with
good
malt
character
more
full
that
a
typical
german
munich
helles
but
just
as
nice
however
after
drinking
a
16
oz
can
of
this
i
fell
like
had
just
eaten
a
meal
i
see
the
can
reports
unfiltered
but
id
think
there
would
be
more
yeasty
breadiness
because
of
that
d
very
drinkable
with
some
delicate
flavors
built
around
a
base
of
pilsner
malts
i
am
no
expert
on
this
particular
style
but
i
found
surly
hells
lager
to
be
utterly
refreshing
to
drink
this
beer
is
the
reason
why
i
need
to
check
out
more
lagers
overall
a
masterfully
executed
brew
and
has
single
handedly
rejuvenated
my
love
for
lagers
great
lagers
seem
to
be
few
and
hard
between
in
the
american
craft
seen
but
this
one
is
a
must
try
surly
hell
45
looking
forward
to
some
furious
and
bender
the
next
time
around
o
good
easy
drinking
refreshing
lager
but
i
prefer
an
authentic
german
munich
helles
especially
at
this
price
point
10
99
for
4
cans
o
super
drinkable
i
could
drink
this
all
the
time
a
very
different
helles
missing
lots
of
the
bakery
malt
action
and
almost
comes
off
as
a
crisp
czech
like
pilsner
with
more
yeast
like
punch
a
very
good
lager
from
surly
pale
and
bright
in
color
with
a
dish
soap
frothy
looking
head
but
this
may
be
best
consumed
right
from
the
can
nose
of
german
pilsener
malts
and
light
vegetal
hops
more
czech
in
aroma
than
german
or
american
but
its
tough
to
tell
through
the
cereal
heavy
smell
of
it
all
tough
to
pick
out
lager
yeast
too
as
even
in
taste
this
is
not
as
clean
as
more
traditional
versions
bready
pils
malt
up
front
in
taste
dense
and
hearty
yet
i
find
this
impossibly
easy
to
drink
hops
just
bitter
very
little
real
flavor
coming
from
them
but
their
contribution
is
critical
i
almost
get
some
oats
or
something
slightly
sweeter
and
fuller
bodied
here
the
body
on
this
is
large
and
the
carbonation
gives
it
a
pillowy
mouthfeel
not
usually
associated
with
this
style
it
really
makes
it
for
me
luxurious
and
creamy
are
not
lager
words
so
props
to
surly
for
making
that
association
for
the
first
time
for
me
not
their
most
epic
work
but
a
darn
good
daily
drink
here
hell
pours
a
golden
straw
color
with
a
small
head
there
is
a
slightly
stale
and
very
sweet
aroma
very
crisp
the
taste
is
on
the
lighter
side
a
nice
sweetness
crisp
light
malt
flavors
very
refreshing
nice
feel
good
carbonation
but
lighter
flavor
overall
its
a
very
refreshing
and
tasty
beer
would
be
great
for
the
summer
i
know
im
in
the
minority
when
i
say
this
but
this
is
my
overall
favorite
surly
beer
the
taste
is
full
without
being
overpowering
the
after
taste
has
what
they
call
a
bread
like
flavor
and
to
me
it
goes
well
with
anything
from
pizza
to
steak
an
absolute
winner
this
is
a
beer
i
could
have
everyday
if
only
surly
could
bring
the
price
down
a
buck
or
so
whether
or
not
this
is
a
tribute
to
helles
lager
or
a
dortmunder
its
very
curious
to
see
more
definitive
american
breweries
known
for
fruity
intense
hop
profiles
and
the
classic
2row
caramel
malt
flavor
brewing
these
kinds
of
lagers
when
they
are
switching
up
their
game
from
brewing
ales
i
tend
to
prefer
lagers
that
are
a
bit
more
balanced
with
an
emphasis
on
the
classic
toffee
maltspicy
and
grassy
hop
profile
but
i
suppose
this
is
a
good
change
of
pace
for
the
brewery
this
isnt
a
style
that
always
leads
to
great
things
and
in
this
case
nothing
is
wrong
with
it
id
love
to
have
it
fresh
on
tap
someday
however
as
i
feel
many
of
nuances
that
seem
lost
in
this
can
would
be
far
more
present
pours
a
hazy
straw
gold
capped
by
a
bright
white
head
great
retention
plenty
of
grain
and
yeast
on
the
nose
bready
lager
yeast
and
herbal
hops
upfront
very
light
fruit
accent
finishes
with
bread
crust
and
light
honey
notes
light
and
crisp
body
fairly
smooth
lively
carbonation
wonderful
zwickel
very
drinkable
and
a
great
pairing
with
almost
anything
clean
and
smooth
light
apple
and
crackers
very
mild
grassy
bitterness
soft
supple
finish
clean
and
dry
well
carbonated
and
not
at
all
watery
this
is
a
great
helles
very
traditional
and
tasty
when
fresh
tailor
made
for
warm
weather
in
the
biergarten
a
fine
lager
by
the
folks
at
surly
o
a
very
drinkable
that
pairs
well
with
pizza
and
is
sure
to
please
the
average
bmc
drinker
but
give
the
craft
beer
guy
something
to
work
with
not
something
id
get
regularly
but
solid
light
in
body
and
high
carbonation
this
is
a
very
refreshing
lager
and
quite
damn
tasty
as
well
overall
4
great
lager
better
than
the
other
aals
goes
down
like
water
o
very
nice
take
on
munich
helles
lager
i
enjoyed
it
on
a
90
degree
day
superb
drinkability
no
doubt
i
love
a
good
helles
lager
and
one
in
a
can
no
less
this
beer
exhibits
cosmoslevel
balance
in
the
fact
that
it
would
be
acceptable
to
bmc
drinkers
looking
to
turn
to
craft
while
also
being
an
excellent
rendition
of
the
style
it
represents
pleasing
even
people
who
have
been
in
the
game
for
while
now
far
better
than
many
of
the
other
craft
helles
beers
available
in
my
area
why
cant
surly
extend
their
reach
just
a
few
states
east
overall
a
pleasant
very
drinkable
lager
i
could
easily
have
a
few
of
these
back
to
back
not
particularly
complex
or
mysterious
just
solid
and
consistent
o
very
much
true
to
the
style
i
really
enjoyed
drinking
this
beer
for
its
light
qualities
and
flavor
this
is
a
great
beer
for
summer
because
you
can
drink
a
large
quantity
and
not
feel
bloated
i
can
definitely
see
myself
drinking
this
beer
during
an
all
day
tube
float
down
the
quadalupe
river
in
austin
very
enjoyable
lager
i
am
starting
to
enjoy
craft
lagers
and
this
is
most
certainly
a
very
good
one
very
refreshing
and
not
offputting
at
all
pours
a
pale
yellow
into
an
imperial
pint
with
about
an
inch
of
soft
white
head
moderate
lacing
smells
very
bready
and
sweet
with
a
hint
of
spice
and
citrus
hops
taste
is
very
clean
predominantly
breadycrackers
with
subtle
notes
of
spicy
noble
hops
and
citrus
finishes
dry
very
little
linger
light
mouthfeel
very
clean
with
a
fair
amount
of
carbonation
very
drinkable
this
is
an
excellent
lager
although
i
tend
to
prefer
ales
an
excellent
sessionable
brew
very
clean
and
easy
drinking
plenty
of
flavor
but
light
enough
to
have
a
few
and
not
feel
filled
up
d
a
solid
example
of
style
a
wonderfully
sessionable
brew
nice
change
of
pace
for
me
and
a
great
example
of
the
style
pours
a
straw
yellow
color
slight
bit
of
unfiltered
haze
golden
liquid
is
topped
by
half
an
inch
of
white
head
smell
has
a
slight
grainy
sweetness
with
just
enough
hop
presence
grassy
and
a
bit
herbal
taste
is
very
similar
to
the
aroma
no
suprises
just
a
crisp
refreshing
beer
mouthfeel
is
light
crisp
dryish
finish
very
drinkable
would
pair
well
with
most
meals
and
still
great
on
its
own
my
recommendation
a
great
beer
for
the
style
extremely
drinkable
surly
continues
to
do
things
and
if
you
can
get
up
north
to
minnesota
to
get
some
buy
a
bunch
or
order
from
france44
com
the
beer
is
medium
bodied
with
carbonation
that
is
of
medium
intensity
and
feels
big
on
the
tongue
this
creates
a
fairly
full
mouthfeel
with
some
foamy
nuances
closes
semidry
with
little
residual
stickiness
on
the
palate
o
ill
likely
never
drink
this
again
but
it
seems
to
be
a
decent
example
of
a
beer
style
i
dont
care
for
in
some
ways
the
mouthfeel
is
simple
and
clean
but
it
really
has
some
delicate
and
appropriate
touches
and
nuances
theres
a
little
floral
non
hopped
aspect
like
some
kind
of
literal
flower
petal
in
there
mild
pepper
notes
etc
its
kind
of
like
an
episode
of
the
simpsons
it
can
work
on
different
levels
be
it
the
simple
punch
in
the
crotch
laugh
or
something
a
little
more
high
brow
at
the
same
time
example
duffman
proclaiming
in
court
while
being
sued
by
duff
brewery
for
intellectual
property
violations
ever
heard
of
fair
use
hip
thrust
oooohh
yeah
o
this
is
a
really
good
lager
well
done
by
surly
pours
a
clear
golden
color
with
a
medium
white
head
scent
is
somewhat
citrusy
with
a
grainy
aroma
light
hop
aroma
very
light
probably
the
least
appealing
surly
beer
ive
tried
aromawise
taste
is
a
little
bit
better
nice
light
blend
of
hops
grain
malt
and
lemon
very
light
and
easydrinking
mouthfeel
is
light
and
crisp
drinkability
is
high
overall
this
beer
does
not
have
a
lot
going
on
i
could
see
this
one
being
very
user
friendly
to
bmc
drinkers
it
is
very
refreshing
and
decent
for
the
style
of
beer
it
is
not
my
favorite
surly
beer
almost
like
a
pilsner
i
think
this
is
more
of
a
wannabe
oktoberfest
poured
with
a
rich
white
head
and
had
a
golden
wheat
colored
body
picked
up
from
the
midwest
a
standard
pilsner
style
beer
not
too
much
to
write
home
about
but
not
the
shittiest
beer
ive
ever
had
supposed
to
be
a
reminder
of
germany
but
i
have
had
better
c
thanks
to
flax
for
this
one
o
solid
example
of
the
style
though
nothing
exceptional
fairly
drinkable
and
will
satiate
any
lager
craving
o
this
beer
tastes
somewhat
like
a
pale
lager
but
has
a
lot
more
flavors
due
to
its
unfiltered
nature
its
relatively
easy
to
drink
overall
i
dont
think
this
beer
stands
out
like
several
of
surlys
other
offerings
im
glad
i
tried
it
but
id
probably
pass
in
the
future
this
poured
out
looking
like
liquid
gold
it
was
very
nice
looking
it
was
a
very
clear
looking
yellowish
gold
color
with
a
nice
solid
white
head
on
top
the
retention
and
lacing
on
this
beer
was
quite
nice
and
rather
impressive
for
a
beer
of
this
style
the
smell
of
of
the
beer
is
a
little
on
the
yeast
side
with
some
subtle
hops
aromas
and
malt
sweetness
the
taste
of
the
beer
is
malty
with
a
strong
hop
bitter
finish
some
lighter
notes
of
grain
and
bread
in
there
not
overly
grassy
which
i
was
happy
about
the
mouthfeel
is
clean
and
crisp
its
sharp
feeling
too
good
carbonation
and
body
overall
this
is
a
good
brew
not
my
favorite
style
but
it
goes
down
really
easy
and
could
be
enjoyed
anytime
o
very
enjoyable
and
super
easy
to
drink
i
would
recommend
this
beer
to
others
good
flavors
and
aromas
definitely
sessionable
overall
its
simplicity
allows
each
flavor
to
really
stand
out
and
flourish
and
its
just
so
damned
easy
to
drink
just
recently
it
was
announced
that
this
would
be
a
year
round
offering
which
is
good
because
i
will
be
having
this
quite
often
from
now
on
o
nice
lager
right
here
certainly
enough
flavor
and
body
to
separate
itself
from
the
run
of
the
mill
offerings
glad
to
recommend
easy
drinking
lager
with
some
actual
flavor
excellent
on
a
hot
summers
day
loses
points
for
being
expensive
if
it
were
somehow
cheaper
i
would
be
drinking
it
consistently
it
is
very
easy
to
drink
and
the
beer
highlight
of
my
recent
visit
to
the
cities
drinkability
i
like
it
it
is
a
simple
and
refreshing
lager
that
offers
a
nice
and
subtle
complexity
o
a
fine
lager
indeed
wellworth
seeking
out
d
very
drinkable
really
nice
zwickel
really
smooth
and
well
balanced
and
finishes
really
clean
16
oz
can
poured

straw
colored
with
a
faint
amount
of
haze
dense
white
head
forms
and
retains
well
considerable
amount
of
lacing
left
behind
the
nose
starts
with
lemon
and
bread
the
bready
component
features
notes
of
wheat
and
yeast
and
gives
a
biscuit
like
quality
to
the
aroma
light
herbal
hops
make
a
presence
at
the
finish
paired
with
mellow
lager
yeast
the
taste
starts
with
mellow
malty
sweetness
notes
of
lemon
grain
and
corn
this
is
followed
by
huge
bready
dryness
that
off
sets
the
mellow
sweetness
and
provides
a
great
balance
the
finish
features
one
last
wave
of
lemon
zest
tons
of
delicate
flavors
here
balanced
terrifically
mouthfeel
is
light
and
refreshing
this
is
a
terrific
lager
definitely
worth
seeking
out
even
for
the
ale
heads
this
is
a
great
summer
beer
crisp
good
body
flavorful
this
beer
has
a
decent
taste
although
to
much
of
the
light
corn
syrupy
taste
for
me
other
than
that
some
goodness
going
on
here
final
thoughts
i
was
expecting
not
to
be
impressed
by
this
offering
from
surly
lagers
and
wheat
beers
in
general
dont
usually
keep
my
attention
this
long
would
pair
amazingly
with
backyard
bbq
fare
its
light
enough
to
go
down
easy
with
a
hamburger
and
just
complex
enough
to
stand
on
its
own
will
be
seeking
this
one
out
in
the
future
especially
as
a
session
beer
hell
yes
this
bad
boys
been
on
my
wants
for
a
very
long
time
huge
thanks
to
corbet
this
one
pours
out
a
vibrant
golden
color
with
a
large
head
the
aroma
is
light
and
grainy
with
some
hops
and
breadiness
awww
yeah
this
hits
the
tongue
with
the
perfect
lager
crispness
theres
a
perfectly
balanced
bit
of
sweet
bready
and
grainy
maltiness
along
with
a
bit
of
slightly
bitter
floral
hops
the
mouthfeel
is
light
and
briskly
carbonated
and
the
drinkability
is
very
good
everything
is
in
balance
here
its
just
a
perfectly
smooth
balanced
and
delicious
lager
this
is
a
very
good
germanstyle
lager
it
tastes
fresh
and
crisp
has
a
beautiful
malt
backbone
and
only
a
flirtation
with
hops
i
have
nothing
to
complain
about
with
this
beer
it
is
up
to
the
standards
of
having
surly
on
its
label
very
light
and
crisp
kind
of
like
a
wheat
lager
sweetness
isnt
too
much
its
definitely
sweet
but
its
crisp
enough
not
to
make
it
syrupy
maybe
its
the
style
but
its
so
light
and
smooth
yet
finishes
clean
with
just
a
hint
of
grassy
sweetness
o
ive
had
tons
of
lagers
and
only
lagers
before
i
got
to
the
us
many
years
ago
and
this
is
a
topnotch
one
not
as
aggressive
as
a
czech
not
quite
like
most
germans
very
refined
and
clean
o
these
styles
are
very
challenging
for
me
because
they
dont
distinguish
between
each
other
that
much
frankly
this
drinks
like
a
pilsner
with
a
little
extra
yeast
and
a
little
less
hop
bite
its
mellow
grainy
and
wellrounded
for
a
low
abv
summer
sipper
this
is
great
a
big
thank
you
goes
out
to
cpolking
for
sending
me
this
beer
poured
from
a
16
oz
can
pours
a
golden
color
with
a
12
inch
head
smell
is
sweet
malty
taste
is
good
bready
malts
somewhat
sweet
very
refreshing
feels
medium
bodied
in
the
mouth
and
overall
is
a
great
summertime
beer
a
very
good
take
on
a
very
underrated
style
from
surly
great
summer
beer
overall
when
the
weather
warms
up
during
the
year
this
is
the
style
i
look
for
and
surly
did
a
great
job
with
their
take
on
it
i
will
be
coming
back
for
more
and
more
i
am
thankful
to
live
in
the
twin
cities
where
this
is
a
fairly
accessible
beer
in
the
liquor
stores
out
here
i
may
not
be
the
biggest
fan
of
surlys
yearround
line
up
but
they
hit
some
real
homeruns
with
their
seasonals
oone
of
the
better
summer
beers
ive
had
and
one
of
the
better
pale
lagers
ive
had
good
job
surly
anyway
its
quite
simple
and
clean
in
its
flavors
but
the
finish
is
more
sweet
than
it
is
dry
light
body
and
high
carbonation
works
refreshing
and
a
good
summer
beer
on
all
counts
at
the
same
time
not
the
best
summer
beer
i
would
reach
for
a
pilsner
first
that
i
think
surly
should
totally
brew
nothing
memorable
no
noticeable
standout
flavors
or
scents
a
typical
light
lager
very
easy
drinking
wish
i
would
have
bought
more
of
this
one
considering
the
hot
streak
were
having
currently
o
decent
beer
dont
even
know
what
keller
bier
zwickel
bier
is
but
its
pretty
good
for
a
light
colored
lager
not
complex
but
fine
like
your
haircut
is
fine
o
wow
surly
does
no
wrong
hell
is
just
as
good
as
a
prima
pils
to
me
so
drinkable
that
i
dont
know
what
to
say
other
than
i
could
drink
these
non
stop
surly
is
amazing
o
b
solely
because
it
isnt
a
style
that
i
really
care
for
drinks
like
a
good
outdoor
summer
beer
this
might
be
a
candidate
for
my
bonnaroo
beer
in
a
few
weeks
crisp
clean
with
subtle
hops
and
mild
malts
o
i
liked
this
beer
but
it
doesnt
carry
all
of
the
traditional
qualities
of
the
style
i
dont
like
the
american
hopping
like
in
their
other
beers
it
just
doesnt
fit
that
well
all
in
all
though
this
is
still
a
drinkable
enjoyable
beer
o
overall
a
pretty
decent
beer
for
the
style
but
im
just
not
a
big
fan
of
lagers
i
realize
the
keller
bierzwickel
bier
is
a
style
of
its
own
but
i
am
generalizing
my
thoughts
here
nice
to
drink
out
of
a
can
though
for
maximum
cheesiness
i
drank
this
while
watching
hellboy
and
frequently
asked
myself
what
the
hell
is
a
keller
bier
zwickel
bier
good
times
this
was
good
but
it
wasnt
particularly
remarkable
if
i
could
get
this
i
probably
would
drink
it
again
with
food
o
a
fantastic
hells
o
good
clean
drinking
beer
not
sure
if
it
fits
the
style
but
i
am
just
basing
that
of
the
style
note
provided
its
good
but
trying
to
rate
vs
style
it
loses
some
points
o
a
good
lager
thats
refreshing
and
easy
to
drink
the
style
has
personally
never
done
much
for
me
but
as
always
surly
makes
a
valiant
effort
o
sorry
folks
im
just
not
a
fan
of
lagers
this
is
definitely
better
than
most
but
thats
not
saying
much
just
take
a
look
at
the
scores
i
gave
it
if
you
like
lagers
im
sure
youll
dig
this
but
i
think
there
are
significantly
better
beers
on
the
market
by
this
brewery
beats
the
hell
out
of
bmc
for
that
nice
easy
drinking
beer
o
pretty
good
pilsner
like
beer
went
down
very
well
with
some
pizza
o
this
is
a
pretty
good
beer
thats
easy
to
drink
the
taste
is
smooth
and
refreshing
that
keeps
me
coming
back
for
more
overall
worth
picking
up
if
you
have
the
chance
overall
this
one
is
pretty
drinkable
as
the
can
conveys
i
could
see
the
sweetness
though
getting
to
be
a
bit
too
much
after
a
can
or
two
i
would
enjoy
this
one
more
if
the
sweetness
were
turned
down
a
notch
and
if
more
hops
were
thrown
in
not
a
bad
one
just
not
my
style
overall
this
is
a
nice
and
well
made
lager
refreshing
and
very
drinkable
another
very
good
surly
brew
lightly
toasted
grains
up
front
tailed
by
spicy
peppery
hop
bitterness
light
bready
crackery
malt
fills
up
the
palate
with
a
sweetish
honey
edge
doughy
malts
and
slight
mineral
water
bitterness
into
the
finish
finish
is
dry
with
some
snappy
peppery
bitterness
and
lingering
sweetbread
malts
moderate
to
light
body
with
a
crisp
lively
feel
but
not
seltzery
a
very
tasty
easy
drinking
lager
o
overall
a
pleasant
beer
better
suited
for
summer
than
october
but
this
paired
nicely
with
an
80
degree
day
worth
buying
if
youre
in
surlys
distribution
area
but
nothing
special
and
not
worth
hunting
for
overall
i
was
amazed
at
how
much
i
liked
this
i
usually
dont
like
lagers
but
i
could
drink
this
for
hours
pleasantly
surprised
this
is
quite
the
lager
they
dont
get
the
credit
or
attention
they
deserve
but
there
is
still
nothing
harder
to
do
than
brew
a
great
lager
surly
has
done
that
here
with
hell
i
for
one
would
like
to
give
them
props
for
that
nice
work
guys
d
not
my
preferred
surly
but
it
really
shows
their
versatility
nice
lighter
brew
pretty
light
gold
crystal
clear
lots
of
visible
carbonation
good
sized
and
very
persistent
head
smell
is
grassy
hops
and
a
little
light
malt
taste
is
biscuity
light
malt
pleasant
sweetness
herbal
hops
nicely
balanced
medium
to
full
bodied
well
carbonated
very
easily
drinkable
very
solid
beer
overall
o
im
not
that
familiar
with
the
style
but
i
really
enjoyed
this
nice
flavor
not
overpowering
in
any
way
tasty
stuff
straw
colour
fresh
hopped
light
and
tasty
great
drinkability
although
so
dainty
that
the
carbonation
though
not
aggressive
is
obtrusive
moderate
citrus
thanks
john
for
bringing
back
something
that
i
can
drink
pint
after
pint
of
spot
on
overall
hoping
this
sticks
around
the
shelves
for
a
while
because
i
would
make
this
a
staple
beer
even
at
the
around
11
per
4
pack
of
16
oz
cans
that
it
costs
the
mouthfeel
is
light
bodied
high
carbonation
and
just
works
great
overall
this
is
a
nice
sessionable
brew
ive
had
better
but
this
is
something
that
works
great
for
mnf
and
ill
be
finishing
off
the
4
pack
next
weekend
for
college
football
overallfirst
beer
of
the
style
so
im
not
going
to
go
crazy
however
this
is
definitely
a
top
5
session
beer
that
i
would
drink
if
i
could
access
it
but
i
cant
bummer
o
an
enjoyable
lager
to
say
the
least
very
easy
to
drink
and
a
great
way
to
start
the
2011
nfl
season
this
would
be
the
beer
to
tail
gate
with
no
doubt
about
it
recommend
o
nice
offering
and
very
refreshing
do
this
does
not
seem
like
a
beer
that
should
fatigue
the
palate
yet
it
does
so
in
capable
fashion
the
taste
is
authentic
losing
some
refreshment
to
the
boldness
of
the
early
flavors
and
even
more
to
the
harsh
burn
of
acidity
in
its
defense
it
would
probably
go
down
more
easily
in
the
presence
of
savory
food
pretty
drinkable
but
to
be
honest
a
bit
of
a
let
down
so
far
surlys
german
iterations
the
few
ive
tried
havent
wowed
me
i
would
happily
take
st
geargen
brau
or
bischof
keller
bier
over
this
any
day
was
looking
for
a
bit
more
fruittyness
i
could
drink
this
all
day
but
do
not
se
it
as
a
bencmark
for
the
style
by
any
any
means
the
lightness
and
finish
lends
drinkability
the
soft
hops
and
smooth
fruits
flavors
make
it
tasty
id
call
this
more
of
a
helles
that
a
zwickelkeller
and
would
love
to
see
this
in
my
mass
anytime
nice
session
lager
very
light
and
easy
to
drink
yet
it
has
enough
flavor
to
keep
you
interested
and
coming
back
this
is
a
light
bodied
brew
with
a
modest
level
of
carbonation
it
is
crisp
on
the
finish
which
encourages
you
to
continue
with
the
consumption
and
the
alcohol
is
fairly
well
integrated
for
5
with
a
light
warmth
down
the
back
of
the
throat
overall
this
is
a
fantastic
take
on
the
style
very
well
done
this
is
not
a
style
of
beer
i
reach
for
often
but
if
this
was
readily
available
for
me
i
would
drink
it
quite
frequently
throughout
the
summer
light
and
zesty
cereal
grains
fresh
baked
bread
flakey
buttermilk
biscuits
noble
hops
earthy
and
herbal
with
a
slight
floral
quality
in
the
finish
a
nice
flavor
to
this
helles
however
the
body
is
a
bit
off
lacking
in
cabonation
leaves
things
watery
need
more
zip
ahh
and
the
more
i
sip
the
more
pils
flavours
shine
on
in
i
love
this
brew
note
i
dont
have
any
qualms
with
beers
being
canned
opposed
to
being
bottled
but
the
design
on
the
can
is
not
alluring
to
me
at
all
tenfidy
an
amazing
beer
from
oskar
blues
is
canned
yet
has
a
design
that
doesnt
reek
of
fourloko
or
another
cheap
energy
drinkalcohol
hybrid
not
that
this
has
anything
to
do
with
the
beer
itself
its
just
a
note
hell
pours
a
slightly
cloudy
goldenrod
color
lightening
to
straw
in
places
when
held
directly
to
light
theres
close
to
two
fingers
of
white
foam
crowning
the
beer
and
it
shows
moderate
head
retention
and
lacing
the
nose
is
redolent
of
freshly
baked
white
bread
and
crackers
with
a
hint
of
delicate
spiciness
from
the
sterling
hops
the
flavor
is
a
carbon
copy
of
the
nose
theres
really
not
much
too
add
everything
comes
across
very
crisp
and
theres
a
nice
balance
between
all
the
flavors
the
body
is
firm
for
a
sub
5
beer
and
the
carbonation
has
just
a
little
bit
of
kick
in
it
to
keep
things
interesting
i
really
enjoyed
my
can
of
hell
its
got
a
great
combination
of
good
flavor
and
being
very
easy
drinking
i
can
see
myself
buying
this
in
bulk
to
go
along
with
allagash
white
as
my
go
to
beers
next
summer
enjoy
o
a
very
solid
beer
other
than
the
lackluster
appearance
this
is
one
of
my
favorite
lagers
so
drinkable
flavorful
but
not
at
all
fatiguing
cheers
taste
is
grainy
light
and
fresh
this
reminds
me
more
of
a
helles
lager
than
a
zwickel
the
yeast
is
just
not
there
hops
provide
a
nice
bittering
clean
finish
and
the
beer
is
very
drinkable
but
i
am
surprised
that
both
of
the
german
imports
ive
sampled
in
this
style
were
tastier
than
this
i
think
surly
is
one
of
the
best
breweries
in
the
country
but
this
one
just
does
not
really
do
it
for
me
o
this
is
my
first
surly
offering
and
i
really
liked
this
lager
it
was
very
well
balanced
lager
and
i
liked
the
traditional
aspects
about
it
good
work
surly
now
im
ready
for
some
more
o
a
really
enjoyable
lager
but
still
a
lager
no
less
for
those
curious
very
glad
to
have
tried
this
offering
from
surly
for
an
american
brewery
trying
to
squirm
out
a
helles
lager
it
is
a
better
attempt
than
most
but
american
brewers
have
a
lot
to
learn
if
they
want
to
make
a
quality
helles
o
a
bmc
drinkers
cross
over
beer
nothing
sexy
just
easy
drinking
overall
a
solid
beer
nothing
to
get
really
excited
about
but
its
well
made
found
on
tap
at
baileys
taproom
body
is
a
bright
golden
color
rather
still
and
without
much
head
crisp
slightly
sweet
malt
on
the
nose
with
a
decidedly
bready
character
palate
is
crisp
with
a
slight
tang
im
never
sure
how
to
describe
it
but
its
a
telltale
marker
of
the
helles
style
notes
of
light
fruit
bready
malt
and
mildly
fruity
hops
are
present
as
well
body
is
light
and
airy
although
some
more
carbonation
would
not
be
a
bad
addition
a
decent
beer
for
the
start
of
an
evening
in
late
summer
thats
for
sure
do
only
real
complaint
is
on
appearance
shot
out
of
the
gate
like
a
lager
thoroughbred
then
fizzled
and
was
lifeless
tastes
great
though
that
if
they
were
to
lower
the
price
to
about
4
for
6
99
it
may
well
be
my
goto
read
have
to
trade
for
a
couple
cans
beer
every
summer
o
vastly
different
from
the
last
keller
bier
i
had
with
the
other
one
being
my
preference
not
bad
but
probably
my
least
favorite
beer
from
surly
thus
far
o
very
smooth
and
light
refreshing
a
nice
flavorful
lager
that
is
hitting
the
spot
after
doing
some
yardwork
in
the
summer
heat
o
pretty
decent
beer
been
a
while
since
ive
had
a
straight
up
lager
beer
this
is
a
great
lager
style
but
its
not
something
i
would
go
scouring
the
land
for
its
like
a
fuller
flavor
bigger
bodied
mgd
in
my
honest
opinion
which
isnt
a
bad
thing
as
i
feel
this
is
how
a
lager
should
taste
or
how
mgd
wants
to
taste
like
anyway
o
nice
on
a
hot
day
but
the
gastric
quality
was
a
bit
of
a
turnoff
i
think
ill
stick
with
hefeweizens
when
im
in
the
mood
for
a
summer
beer
awesome
can
pretty
good
brew
m
o
drier
than
i
would
have
guessed
this
demands
large
sips
the
finish
is
excellent
just
bitter
enough
to
fade
out
gently
leaving
a
cleansing
lemonmaltsweet
finish
i
am
rather
surprised
by
the
relatively
low
scores
this
has
been
getting
with
a
beer
of
this
style
freshness
is
paramount
im
happy
to
say
this
one
passes
with
flying
colors
surly
hell
is
a
true
tostyle
winner
wish
we
had
it
here
o
this
is
a
marginally
hoppier
version
of
any
bmc
beer
i
dont
find
this
offensive
possibly
because
its
a
fresh
can
but
also
perhaps
because
there
is
very
little
flavor
theyve
nailed
the
light
lager
style
which
i
hear
is
technically
difficult
to
produce
the
cpj
o
pretty
good
one
of
the
better
lagers
ive
had
but
not
a
style
i
go
nuts
over
d
definitely
crisp
and
refreshing
during
this
heat
wave
we
are
having
but
this
is
definitely
not
surlys
best
stuff
this
beer
is
not
fun
it
was
hell
to
drink
the
malts
were
heavy
and
syrupy
seemed
not
very
carbonated
and
flat
yeast
taste
was
very
rough
and
gave
me
a
headache
not
impressed
with
this
beer
surprised
by
the
high
ratings
yokel
was
better
than
this
a
lot
better
from
my
memories
and
that
is
only
other
zwickel
i
have
had
so
far
but
that
was
a
long
time
ago
o
overall
a
nice
easy
drinking
summer
type
beer
tastes
very
good
and
ill
have
to
try
this
again
o
extremely
drinkable
simple
and
very
well
made
i
would
makethis
a
regular
if
i
could
o
such
a
drinkable
refreshing
light
beer
simple
and
yet
something
in
the
flavors
that
are
quite
complex
o
goes
down
easily
tasty
not
too
filling
mild
kick
nice
representation
of
style
this
is
a
fantastic
easy
drinking
beer
perfect
for
a
nice
summer
night
overall
well
this
might
be
the
first
surly
offering
that
im
underwhelmed
by
especially
for
the
price
if
this
came
straight
from
deutschland
i
could
understand
but
this
is
down
the
road
on
i94
a
few
hundred
miles
anyways
its
a
delicate
style
and
probably
not
my
favourite
in
the
grand
scheme
of
things
i
suppose
i
could
recommend
this
but
i
wont
ever
revisit
it
too
many
other
summer
quenchers
at
much
more
reasonable
prices
hard
to
say
anything
bad
about
this
beer
poured
a
lovely
strawyellow
with
a
solid
white
head
that
dissipated
quickly
the
aroma
is
of
german
hops
and
sweet
bread
dough
hell
drinks
light
and
refreshing
while
maintaining
a
viscous
texture
it
is
really
quite
interesting
no
bitterness
at
all
more
of
a
sweet
beer
with
just
enough
hops
to
keep
things
even
keel
perfect
for
drinking
while
grilling
which
incidentally
is
what
i
was
doing
poured
into
my
bruery
snifter
golden
yellow
clear
pour
with
bubbles
and
a
small
white
head
smells
nice
i
am
shockingly
under
qualified
to
review
a
zwickel
beer
a
light
sweetness
and
mild
hop
profile
combine
with
a
mild
breadiness
the
taste
follows
the
nose
with
a
fresh
and
clean
flavor
making
this
astonishingly
drinkable
mouthfeel
is
clean
relatively
light
and
carries
a
very
small
lingering
sweetness
this
is
such
a
nice
drinker
on
a
porch
with
my
wife
after
work
on
a
warm
day
go
get
em
surly
overall
a
very
solid
take
on
a
german
style
refreshing
easy
to
drink
and
with
enough
flavor
going
on
to
keep
things
interesting
overall
a
very
tasty
lager
that
is
well
balanced
and
fairly
light
surly
knocks
it
out
of
the
park
again
lots
of
oldtime
bready
sweetness
on
the
palate
mixed
the
grain
is
surprisingly
smooth
as
it
goes
down
the
slightest
kiss
of
hops
at
the
end
provides
balance
i
could
and
did
drink
this
all
night
o
a
well
put
together
beer
for
what
it
is
nevertheless
not
as
complex
as
i
wanted
at
the
time
yet
an
enjoyable
quaff
after
a
hot
day
at
the
lake
i
realize
this
probably
takes
a
lot
of
skill
to
produce
this
type
of
quality
lager
and
the
price
in
theory
may
be
justified
but
i
really
think
this
could
really
become
a
go
to
beer
for
many
if
it
was
priced
a
little
lower
and
marketed
to
the
macro
crowd
i
could
see
this
being
surlys
spotted
cow
but
only
100
times
better
it
is
hard
to
do
justice
in
describing
just
how
awesome
this
beer
tastes
and
smells
one
of
surlys
more
drinkable
beers
to
be
sure
not
that
i
dont
love
some
of
surlys
heftier
offerings
but
its
nice
to
see
them
brew
an
awesome
beer
that
while
falling
slightly
outside
of
true
session
abv
range
could
certainly
be
sessioned
crisp
clean
tasty
refreshing
and
awesome
on
a
hot
summer
day
o
not
really
a
fan
of
light
beers
but
this
is
quite
tasty
and
refreshing
during
the
summer
months
another
solid
seasonal
offering
from
surly
overall
its
a
style
i
drink
very
rarely
but
one
that
i
feel
surly
has
done
a
solid
job
with
grab
a
lawn
chair
enjoy
a
couple
of
these
and
call
it
a
fine
summer
day
o
im
not
a
big
fan
of
lagers
this
is
one
of
the
better
more
refreshing
lagers
ive
had
but
its
not
a
style
i
care
about
solid
brew
on
the
lower
scale
of
beers
from
surly
imo
im
constantly
wowed
by
surlys
beers
but
this
one
didnt
bowl
me
over
i
know
its
a
pale
lager
but
its
lacking
the
subtlety
and
complexity
ive
come
to
expect
from
their
takes
on
milder
styles
i
might
drink
it
again
i
might
not
leaning
towards
not
im
looking
forward
to
trying
this
on
tap
somewhere
soon
of
the
summer
styles
ive
been
trying
lately
i
think
hell
takes
the
cake
overall
what
this
beer
lacks
in
complexity
it
makes
up
in
sheer
drinkability
this
is
a
great
beer
for
drinking
on
a
warm
summer
day
or
night
not
one
to
pass
up
as
the
style
presents
something
new
to
many
craft
beer
drinkers
and
oh
yeah
its
in
a
can
pours
a
golden
yellow
with
two
fingers
of
white
head
smells
of
a
breadybiscuity
with
a
slight
grassy
hop
aroma
taste
of
bready
malt
dry
grassy
hops
with
a
slight
lemon
citrus
mouth
is
nicely
carbonatednot
too
much
like
some
lagers
very
light
this
is
a
great
beer
for
all
seasons
but
would
be
best
for
these
hot
months
this
is
just
a
regular
ol
helles
its
wellbrewed
like
i
said
but
you
could
have
told
me
it
had
come
from
any
other
competent
brewer
and
i
would
have
believed
you
the
beer
pours
a
rich
golden
color
with
a
finger
of
white
foam
head
recedes
leaving
a
thick
coaster
and
some
nice
lacing
the
nose
is
bready
malt
and
mild
citrus
taste
is
malt
forward
with
a
nice
citrus
quality
at
play
in
the
background
the
body
is
light
but
not
thin
a
high
level
of
carbonation
suits
this
beer
well
overall
this
is
another
solid
offering
from
surly
glad
i
got
the
opportunity
thin
to
medium
mouthfeel
and
medium
carbonation
very
nice
d
very
easy
to
drink
a
very
suitable
summer
beer
note
i
rated
this
comparing
it
to
what
it
is
supposed
to
be
not
in
comparison
to
other
styles
such
as
dipa
and
imperial
stouts
etc
for
a
lager
beer
it
really
hits
on
all
cylinders
it
is
light
on
taste
too
though
while
it
does
the
keller
bier
style
with
poise
its
just
not
really
that
tasty
a
style
for
being
as
light
as
it
is
theres
still
a
bready
feel
in
the
mouth
that
gives
you
something
to
look
forward
to
each
sip
that
combined
with
the
low
abv
of
it
and
the
ease
on
the
palate
makes
this
a
very
drinkable
beer
one
i
would
repeat
en
masse
without
regret
poured
a
hazy
pale
golden
yellow
with
a
finger
of
fluffy
white
head
and
left
a
little
lacing
sticking
to
the
glass
the
aroma
was
quite
light
but
nice
consisting
of
malts
various
grains
slight
hop
character
and
some
citrus
notes
peeking
through
the
flavor
brought
out
the
hops
a
tad
bit
more
alongside
the
varoius
grains
citrus
accents
and
a
malt
backing
to
balance
out
the
zwickel
the
brew
was
light
in
body
with
a
good
amount
of
tingly
carbonation
which
had
a
grainy
citrusy
and
slight
hop
bite
finish
it
drank
very
good
and
was
very
refreshing
i
hope
i
can
get
my
hands
on
more
of
these
surly
beers
it
never
ceases
to
amaze
me
at
how
full
surly
fills
their
cans
following
the
crack
the
glug
has
to
take
place
rather
quickly
to
avoid
foamover
i
started
with
just
better
than
a
finger
of
foamy
bonewhite
head
that
quickly
fell
leaving
some
lacing
in
its
wake
color
was
a
slightly
hazy
goldenyellow
i
was
frankly
disappointed
as
i
hoping
for
opaque
filled
with
yeastdriven
haze
oh
well
nose
was
very
bready
up
front
with
a
a
tang
of
noble
hops
behind
it
mmmm
mouthfeel
was
mediumtofull
with
a
minty
grassy
hoppiness
on
the
tongue
initially
but
giving
way
to
a
bready
biscuity
maltiness
finish
was
clean
and
crisp
with
a
nice
balancing
act
between
to
hops
and
malt
i
was
not
blown
away
by
the
experience
but
on
the
other
hand
i
have
had
so
many
pspoor
lagerstyle
beers
out
of
a
can
that
this
was
a
welcome
change
id
leave
some
room
in
my
cooler
but
there
are
better
surlys
to
be
had
skål
when
the
folks
at
surly
created
this
beer
they
did
so
in
a
manner
that
allowed
for
true
character
to
shine
through
theres
no
place
for
error
to
hide
with
this
beer
which
is
fine
cause
i
dont
think
theres
any
error
to
discuss
d
excellent
clean
dry
finish
leads
to
maximum
chugability
this
is
an
excellent
summer
time
brew
perfect
for
hot
days
playing
horseshoes
from
personal
experience
the
crisp
bitterness
satisfying
as
is
the
malt
i
cant
say
this
is
something
im
after
again
but
i
wanted
to
try
it
it
is
leaps
and
bounds
in
front
of
macros
big
thanks
to
billab914
for
this
extra
in
a
recent
trade
served
from
can
into
a
warsteiner
mug
pours
a
golden
yellow
orange
with
a
one
finger
pure
white
head
that
subsided
to
a
minimal
amount
maintained
nice
lacing
throughout
the
glass
the
aroma
was
comprised
of
malt
citrus
bread
and
spices
the
flavor
was
of
malt
citrus
spices
and
subtle
hop
it
had
a
light
feel
on
the
palate
with
mild
carbonation
overall
this
was
a
very
nice
brew
i
am
definitely
glad
i
got
the
chance
to
try
this
one
it
had
a
very
nice
refreshing
flavor
to
it
with
great
flavors
went
down
very
easily
and
quickly
due
to
this
fact
this
is
a
definite
must
try
without
a
doubt
hell
is
top
notch
for
drinkability
incredibly
flavorful
balanced
the
american
hops
do
wonders
for
the
beer
without
overshadowing
the
finer
aspects
if
possible
this
would
have
regular
visits
in
the
old
beer
fridge
recommended
i
feel
like
surly
has
a
cult
following
and
some
will
overrate
their
beers
based
on
reputation
however
it
is
a
reputation
they
fully
deserve
this
is
not
a
typical
surly
beer
but
it
is
excellent
a
great
summer
brew
glad
i
got
to
experience
it
this
is
light
and
easy
in
every
way
zesty
and
grainy
but
refreshing
another
very
good
beer
from
surly
havent
had
a
subpar
one
yet
if
i
had
a
regular
supply
this
would
be
staple
in
my
fridge
during
the
summer
the
flavor
is
similarly
mild
but
unequivocally
delicious
lightly
toasted
pale
pilsen
malts
lay
down
a
solid
dry
base
thats
both
crisp
and
refreshing
a
tinge
of
grassy
hops
is
saved
for
the
finish
with
a
light
mineral
presence
the
body
is
perfectly
balancednot
too
thinand
nicely
carbonated
hell
drinks
incredibly
smooth
with
a
little
bite
on
the
end
an
excellent
lager
from
a
can
from
the
good
folks
at
surly
and
a
fun
exercise
in
subtlety
for
the
imperial
age
decent
beer
but
not
especially
exciting
in
any
particular
attribute
honestly
the
only
thing
that
keeping
this
one
at
4
in
the
drinkability
category
is
the
style
this
style
practically
defines
the
term
for
me
thus
any
bit
of
coarseness
is
a
bit
of
a
hit
even
a
minor
one
as
in
this
one
a
perfect
summer
lager
with
nice
flavor
and
mouthfeel
d
the
perfect
summer
session
beer
incredibly
refreshing
but
gives
you
almost
nothing
to
think
about
when
drinking
it
goes
down
easy
as
hell
though
ill
be
needing
more
of
this
as
the
football
season
kicks
into
gear
d
a
pretty
nice
beer
that
is
very
easy
to
drink
some
nice
fruit
in
the
smell
and
taste
would
try
again
it
did
become
a
bit
boring
towards
the
end
if
i
werent
thinking
about
it
i
wouldnt
have
noticed
though
d
other
than
the
overly
bloaty
carbonation
i
cant
see
anything
that
would
be
a
big
inhibitor
wish
this
was
available
at
the
ballpark
or
something
a
better
session
beer
than
gossamer
in
my
opinion
drinkability
is
good
the
alcohol
is
hidden
well
but
it
leans
a
little
toward
sweetness
so
its
not
completely
balanced
quite
tasty
mouthfeel
is
light
bodied
with
low
carbonation
just
a
hint
of
acidity
goes
down
real
easy
a
nice
lager
with
some
different
character
thanks
russ
and
jen
pours
an
unfiltered
cloudyclear
straw
golden
color
with
an
airy
white
head
that
quickly
fades
to
wispy
ring
with
little
lacing
looks
like
any
other
lager
only
slightly
more
hazy
aroma
is
again
very
lager
like
pale
malts
breadiness
mild
green
fruit
sweetness
and
very
little
hop
presence
flavor
is
slightly
richer
than
your
average
lager
with
a
slight
yeast
taste
adding
some
snap
to
an
otherwise
unremarkable
and
light
bready
malt
body
the
finish
is
the
most
unique
part
with
the
hops
showing
up
at
the
last
minute
with
some
zesty
lemon
notes
light
bodied
with
full
carbonation
and
a
clean
dry
finish
is
this
the
best
surly
beer
or
keller
no
but
in
the
context
of
other
light
lagers
this
is
phenomenal
drinkability
good
in
person
trade
with
dirtylou
thanks
dood
the
mouthfeel
is
on
the
lighter
side
with
carbonation
being
moderate
for
the
style
drinkability
is
very
good
it
was
a
very
easy
drinking
and
flavorful
beer
it
has
a
very
nice
balance
to
it
that
aided
in
the
drinkability
the
lager
crispness
made
this
a
nice
refreshing
choice
after
working
on
my
kitchen
renovation
all
day
this
was
a
disappointing
brew
its
very
1sided
what
you
taste
initially
is
what
you
get
nothing
else
emerges
as
you
drink
dont
bother
hunting
this
one
not
worth
you
time
pours
a
very
clear
yellowy
orange
color
with
a
niven
creamy
white
head
aroma
has
some
lemony
hops
and
some
sweet
bread
nice
balance
taste
is
very
clean
and
crisp
similar
to
a
helles
lager
but
this
has
some
more
hops
to
it
really
beautiful
flavors
and
great
for
the
summer
the
mouthfeel
is
medium
bodied
but
light
flavorwise
on
the
finish
drinkability
is
up
there
and
love
the
cans
can
grabbed
a
fresh
4
pack
the
other
day
and
time
to
revisit
this
old
friend
after
drinking
plenty
of
it
last
year
pours
an
absolute
crystal
clear
golden
color
with
a
white
as
snow
2
finger
head
the
smell
is
very
clean
slight
hops
and
balanced
sweetness
the
taste
can
only
really
be
described
as
clean
and
crisp
a
great
summer
time
beer
for
anyone
including
macro
only
drinkers
from
surly
you
expect
a
big
hop
bomb
or
something
else
extreme
but
this
is
just
a
straight
up
drinking
beer
if
you
are
looking
for
strong
hops
then
look
somewhere
else
as
this
will
not
satisfy
that
craving
lightmedium
mouthfeel
d
excellent
drinkability
this
beer
seems
to
disappear
quickly
its
light
enough
to
offer
good
sessionability
with
just
enough
complexity
to
keep
my
interest
well
crafted
and
worth
seeking
out
thanks
to
sean
for
this
great
beer
to
start
the
night
pour
is
nothing
special
looks
like
a
lager
aroma
is
light
but
refreshing
not
any
skunk
taste
is
also
lighter
with
light
hops
but
totally
easy
to
drink
no
skunks
at
all
one
of
the
best
lagers
ive
had
this
is
a
nice
beer
and
very
drinkable
great
hot
weather
beer
for
sure
i
think
id
choose
a
pilsener
first
in
most
cases
but
i
would
be
quite
happy
grabbing
a
can
of
this
on
a
warm
day
as
well
good
stuff
thanks
to
connor
for
getting
surly
to
ny
for
me
poured
into
a
pint
glass
the
beer
has
a
nice
twofinger
fluffy
white
head
which
recedes
to
a
thin
film
smell
the
lager
yeast
with
a
very
sweet
malt
profile
behind
it
clean
tasting
with
strong
yeasty
bready
flavors
its
very
smooth
and
light
bodied
very
refreshing
this
is
a
great
and
easy
beer
to
drink
im
glad
they
come
in
16
oz
cans
beer
is
medium
to
light
in
body
with
minimal
grainy
bitterness
very
smooth
in
the
mouth
minimal
carbonation
on
the
palate
nice
sweetness
up
front
finishes
wet
a
great
and
easy
drinking
summer
brew
from
surly
what
can
i
say
this
beer
was
a
knockout
in
my
opinion
and
i
really
wish
this
was
a
beer
that
we
could
get
regularly
here
in
pennsylvania
if
i
had
to
come
up
with
a
one
word
description
of
this
beer
i
would
say
balance
because
this
baby
is
perfect
the
drinkability
on
this
was
extremely
high
and
i
know
i
could
drink
a
few
more
right
now
this
was
light
and
crisp
and
mildly
hoppy
which
was
a
great
combonation
for
for
just
about
every
beer
drinker
across
the
board
i
really
feel
that
this
could
be
a
great
gateway
beer
for
the
bmc
drinkers
out
there
if
you
get
a
chance
to
try
this
beer
id
highly
recommend
it
and
you
should
seek
it
out
if
you
are
into
beer
trading
because
you
will
not
be
disappointed
a
slightly
above
average
brew
good
to
wash
down
a
grilled
kielbasa
sandwich
not
the
top
offering
from
the
brewery
worth
a
try
if
you
see
it
solid
on
style
but
not
really
my
cup
of
tea
semibland
but
would
be
great
after
cutting
the
grass
on
a
hot
afternoon
serving
type
can
supremely
drinkable
o
very
solid
offering
and
not
a
typical
surly
hopbomb
d
very
drinkable
low
abv
makes
it
a
nice
session
beer
very
nice
for
the
style
this
is
very
disappointing
coming
from
surly
this
is
the
second
time
i
have
had
this
beer
at
a
different
location
this
time
around
so
no
mistake
in
getting
the
order
right
it
reminded
me
of
japanese
beer
perhaps
if
it
were
chilled
to
34f
it
would
be
more
palatable
drinkability
is
nice
good
crisp
and
low
abv
bitterness
detracts
a
bit
from
drinkability
depic
summer
beer
best
lager
ive
probably
ever
had
in
my
life
as
usual
im
in
debt
to
my
friends
in
the
cities
d
drinkability
is
off
the
charts
awesomely
crisp
and
very
very
refreshing
goes
down
sooo
smooth
and
fast
easily
go
through
a
4pack
no
problem
and
a
low
abv
to
boot
fiendishly
drinkable
no
doubt
not
really
sure
why
this
beer
is
so
popular
and
so
difficult
to
procure
there
are
many
lagers
that
i
would
drink
over
this
d
very
drinkable
brew
lighter
than
any
of
the
other
surly
brews
nice
refreshing
taste
a
well
put
crafted
brew
perfect
summer
sipper
i
recommend
this
brew
and
will
for
sure
have
this
again
thanks
shango42
anyways
this
clear
golden
brew
pours
with
a
medium
white
head
the
aroma
has
toasted
barley
with
light
blackberries
and
creamy
orange
the
flavor
starts
out
with
a
strong
toast
and
cracker
but
rich
yet
mellow
herbal
citrus
hops
there
are
also
hints
of
vanilla
cinnamon
cream
soda
and
lemon
i
know
this
style
is
meant
to
be
enjoyed
cold
but
this
beer
comes
alive
at
cellar
temperature
its
not
a
straightup
traditional
helles
like
the
label
says
or
zwickel
but
its
close
to
both
and
a
damn
fine
lager
i
want
more
and
so
should
you
cant
believe
i
havent
reviewed
this
yet
might
as
well
start
now
i
poured
this
can
up
to
the
brim
in
a
pint
glass
and
there
was
still
some
left
in
the
can
bonus
however
this
means
no
head
or
lacing
but
its
a
nice
golden
color
with
yellow
edges
takes
a
few
sips
while
its
resting
on
the
desk
yum
okay
the
smell
aroma
is
lightly
fruity
with
a
pale
malt
sweetness
and
only
mild
hops
taste
is
great
everything
i
expect
out
of
light
lager
smooth
easy
drinking
crisp
mild
sweetness
just
enough
bitterness
to
back
things
up
with
no
real
hop
flavor
present
only
light
bitterness
bready
and
grainy
this
is
how
all
american
macro
lagers
should
taste
feel
is
light
almost
medium
low
carbonation
and
certainly
quaffable
session
beer
bitches
the
overall
character
combined
with
lower
abv
a
higher
carbonation
and
light
body
lends
to
a
clean
palate
and
high
drinkability
very
drinkable
perfect
beer
for
a
hot
summer
day
as
pale
lagers
or
kellerbiers
go
this
is
pretty
much
right
on
track
for
the
style
perhaps
a
bit
more
american
then
german
as
its
sweetness
isnt
as
deep
and
softly
breaded
as
the
german
types
that
ive
enjoyed
solid
none
the
less
and
surlys
only
true
drinking
summer
beer
that
needed
to
be
released
about
a
month
earlier
its
been
hot
and
this
quenches
the
summer
thirst
well
drinkability
is
excellent
very
refreshing
and
easy
to
drink
d
incredibly
drinkable
and
perfect
for
a
hot
summer
mn
day
like
today
the
only
problem
with
this
beers
drinkability
is
that
one
might
be
too
inclined
to
chug
it
down
but
the
truth
is
as
great
as
it
is
cold
if
you
let
it
warm
ever
so
slightly
the
flavors
become
more
pronounced
i
feel
like
ive
said
this
about
another
beer
but
now
this
is
the
best
lager
ive
ever
had
once
again
surly
is
awesome
d
quite
easy
to
down
a
tasty
can
of
this
very
good
session
beer
pours
a
crystal
clear
yellow
color
with
a
finger
of
head
aroma
a
nice
light
corn
maltiness
very
clean
and
appetizing
the
flavor
follows
suit
with
a
clean
corn
and
biscuit
maltiness
dominating
none
of
the
mustiness
that
i
often
find
comes
with
this
type
of
flavor
profile
the
body
is
medium
and
the
carbonation
is
nice
and
soft
the
drinkability
is
high
in
terms
of
volume
but
average
in
terms
of
desire
simply
because
it
is
not
an
exciting
style
overall
a
very
solid
example
of
the
style
and
a
blueprint
session
beer
d
top
notch
a
little
light
in
the
aroma
department
but
all
around
nice
and
refreshing
with
warm
days
around
the
corner
this
is
a
good
choice
for
roof
top
drinking
the
can
is
a
plus
the
beer
is
light
bodied
and
highly
carbonated
the
carbonation
adds
to
the
crisp
and
sharp
flavors
and
characteristics
of
the
beer
there
is
also
a
nice
dry
finish
that
gives
the
beer
an
even
more
clean
vibrant
flavor
this
is
something
i
could
enjoy
several
cans
of
the
low
alcohol
light
body
and
sharpclean
flavors
make
this
very
drinkable
and
enjoyable
another
good
beer
from
surly
i
have
yet
to
be
disappointed
by
any
of
their
offerings
pours
a
nice
straw
color
with
a
bit
of
unfiltered
haze

nice

of
white

nice

it

has
a
pilsner
grainy
sweetness
with
an
eversoslight
hop
presence
a
bit
grassy
with
hints
of
herbal
earth
taste
is
very
similar
with
a
tiny
amount
of
spice
thrown
in
there
mouthfeel
is
light
with
a
nice
crispness
very
drinkable
reminds
me
yet
again
why
i
need
to
always
have
more
surly
see
you
in
hell
poured
from
the
can
into
a
tulip
thanks
eric

a
brilliant
yellow
gold
with
a
fluffy
1
head
and
a
slight
haze
smells
of
fresh
breads
some
toastiness
and
lightly
of
hops
nice
crisp
flavor
some
bready
yeast
and
a
good
amount
of
bitterness
on
the
sides
of
my
tongue
slightly
cloying
bitter
aftertaste
lessens
the
drinkability
score
but
would
be
a
great
lawnmower
beer
on
a
nice
summer
day
part
of
my
secret
santa
2009
haul
from
scoobydank
this
is
the
only
beer
i
was
missing
in
order
to
have
tried
everything
surly
has
put
into
cans
thus
far
poured
from
a
16
ounce
can
into
my
nonic
imperial
pint
glass
appears
a
mildly
hazed
bright
golden
yellow
color
with
around
a
finger
of
fluffy
white
foam

and
flavors
consist
of
toasted
grain
bread
nice
fruitiness
apple
pear
grape

touch
of
sweetness
light
caramel

medium
bodied
with
adequate
carbonation
dry
clean
and
pretty
drinkable
nicely
done
keller
are
one
of
the
few
lagers
that
i
truly
enjoy
and
this
one
hits
the
mark
pours
rich
golden
with
low
cloudiness
and
a
nondescript
white
head
that
displays
fair
retention
and
spots
of
lace
aroma
is
primarily
earthy
hops
with
lots
of
straw
and
an
easy
malt
sweetness
tastes
of
straw
with
earthy
hops
that
provide
a
pleasantly
moderate
amount
of
bittering
malt
sweetness
takes
a
background
for
a
crisp
finish
with
only
the
kiss
of
the
hops
light
to
medium
in
body
with
a
good
moderate
carbonationnot
too
fizzy
but
plenty
of
bubbles
overall
a
very
pleasant
pale
lager
on
par
with
americas
best
examples
edit
after
reading
up
on
keller
bier
a
style
i
admittedly
new
very
little
about
before
drinking
this
beer
i
raised
the
appearance
from
3
0
to
3
5
this
beer
is
traditionally
cloudy
overall
a
very
solid
session
offering
from
surly
definitely
wouldnt
hesitate
to
pick
this
up
if
were
available
to
me
drinkability
this
beer
is
a
great
example
of
an
all
night
easy
drinking
sessionable
beer
to
me
it
has
good
flavor
but
nothing
too
robust
or
extreme
i
can
see
myself
tossing
back
a
few
of
these
in
an
evening
however
i
will
have
to
move
on
to
something
else
since
this
is
my
only
one
reviewed
on
9122009

cheers
pours

the

is

with

good

i
really
like
the
beer
and
could
see
myself
drinking
it
often
in
the
summer
poured
from
a
16
oz
can
into
an
oversized
pilsner
glass
golden
color
thick
white
head
that
dissipated
into
good
lacing
all
the
way
down
sweet
aroma
with
a
bit
of
hoppy
shaprness
at
the
edges
this
had
a
pleasant
sweetess
all
the
way
through
and
finished
very
clean
i
can
imagine
a
good
goto
beer
on
a
hot
summer
day
ill
have
to
save
one
until
it
warms
up
a
bit
here
d
this
brew
was
pretty
easy
to
drink
the
sweetness
really
threw
me
off
guard
very
easy
to
drink
on
the
palate
i
get
grain
and
fruit
flavors
and
ample
bitterness
from
hops
and
grain
husk
its
light
clean
refreshing
as
hell
lmao
with
a
grainy
mildly
bitter
finish
beyond
a
hint
of
initial
sweetness
upfront
this
beer
is
quite
dry
and
crisp
another
delicious
canned
offering
from
surly
can
this
brewery
do
wrong
the
answer
fyi
is
yes
they
can
but
not
often
d
oh
so
easy
to
drink
refreshing
and
perfect
on
a
surprisingly
temperate
november
afternoon
low
alcohol
definitely
could
have
another
gone
too
quickly
thanks
jim
d
and
overall
impression
drinkability
gets
high
marks
with
the
low
abv
and
the
light
body
i
could
have
quite
a
few
of
these
overall
for
what
this
is
this
is
a
good
beer
very
macro
like
but
with
a
fuller
flavor
but
that
being
said
surly
makes
much
better
offerings
skal
drinkability
im
not
a
fan
of
the
style
or
the
flavor
profile
but
its
a
session
beer
all
the
way
d
easy
drinking
helles
that
is
well
balanced
and
has
a
nice
fruity
aroma
and
flavor
i
was
expecting
something
a
bit
more
extreme
from
surly
but
this
was
just
a
fine
example
of
the
style
d
drinkability
is
pretty
good
for
the
hell
flavor
is
mild
alcohol
is
low
its
very
smooth
thats
pretty
much
the
trifecta
of
an
easy
drinking
brew
the
aroma
could
probably
use
a
little
work
but
thats
really
about
it
i
could
easily
see
this
beer
find
a
niche
in
the
concert
sporting
event
crowd
given
the
current
distribution
i
probably
wouldnt
seek
this
one
out
again
if
given
the
chance
though
id
probably
never
turn
it
down
either
overall
this
is
a
very
clean
lager
that
has
a
good
amount
of
drinkability
worth
a
shot
lots
of
crisp
light
flavor
but
not
watered
down
at
all
refreshing
slightly
creamy
medium
body
with
a
nice
amount
of
bready
yeast
and
crisp
light
fruit
im
picking
up
a
lot
of
apple
first
in
the
aroma
and
now
in
the
flavor
there
is
a
lot
of
sweet
pilsner
malt
that
is
countered
by
a
slight
zest
spiciness
and
an
amazing
crisp
floral
hop
presence
as
well
as
a
pleasant
toasted
biscuit
malt
character
this
is
an
insanely
drinkable
very
flavorful
session
beer
that
i
wish
that
i
had
constant
access
to
this
is
a
very
solid
lager
from
surly
and
extremely
drinkable
not
sure
its
my
favorite
style
but
this
is
a
very
good
example
pours
a
clear
straw
yellow
with
a
big
three
finger
fluffy
white
head
a
slow
crawl
down
the
sides
of
the
glass
leaves
behind
spotty
spiderweb
lacing
smell
is
pretty
mild
corn
honey
and
some
bready
malts
nothing
more
nothing
less
after
the
first
sip
i
realize
the
taste
is
exactly
like
the
nose
corn
honey
and
bready
malts
the
only
difference
is
a
slight
floral
hop
flavor
but
its
very
minimal
pretty
hefty
medium
body
for
a
lager
i
like
good
carbonation
with
a
creamy
feel
drinkable
for
sure
but
it
should
be
its
a
5
1
lager
i
had
two
cans
of
this
prior
to
my
review
and
at
first
i
really
loved
this
beer
now
sitting
down
and
reviewing
it
i
find
that
that
love
has
faded
kinda
like
danos
stone
washed
jeans
nothing
too
crazy
about
this
one
its
good
dont
get
me
wrong
but
a
beer
this
is
not
hell
is
neither
eternal
punishment
nor
eternal
reward
its
much
much
closer
to
the
latter
and
might
even
get
there
with
a
few
wellchosen
changes
in
the
end
surly
purgatory
is
probably
a
more
appropriate
name
i
applaud
todd
and
omar
for
going
small
and
hope
they
continue
to
do
so
as
long
as
the
beers
that
made
them
famous
continue
to
be
brewed
thanks
to
feloniousmonk
for
setting
one
aside
for
me
d
very
sessionable
easy
to
drink
and
palette
is
still
fresh
the
mouth
was
a
tad
wet
and
thin
but
for
the
style
that
may
be
normal
not
sure
very
easy
to
drink
though
the
body
was
light
with
little
carbonation
play
on
the
tongue
flavor
was
pretty
decent
light
citrus
pop
with
hints
of
hop
bitterness
and
a
semisour
finish
this
is
my
first
of
this
style
it
reminds
me
of
a
kolsch
or
something
of
the
sort
this
was
refreshing
id
have
another
overall
this
is
a
drinkable
beer
as
it
is
balanced
and
not
overpowering
in
alcohol
or
flavor
however
that
lack
of
intensity
is
also
probably
what
keeps
me
from
rating
it
a
bit
higher
mouthfeel
is
strangely
flat
despite
the
big
white
head
d
a
really
nice
beer
lagers
get
a
bad
name
but
they
can
be
really
good
and
this
is
a
great
beer
i
would
love
to
always
have
this
in
the
fridge
at
the
ready
d
very
drinkable
really
this
should
be
called
surly
session
i
really
liked
this
beer
more
than
i
thought
i
would
one
of
the
best
lagers
ive
had
pours
a
clear
golden
body
with
a
puffy
white
head
that
leaves
decent
lacing
and
is
slow
to
fall
aroma
is
of
light
grassy
hops
and
clean
malts
light
bodied
mouthfeel
with
medium
carbonation
a
mild
bitterness
up
front
leads
to
a
light
sweet
malt
flavor
at
mid
tongue
and
a
slightly
bitter
finish
not
a
bad
beer
but
i
dont
find
myself
wanting
a
second
pint
when
im
through
with
the
first
this
just
isnt
very
good
can
shared
via
piscator34
pours
straw
golden
with
fluffy
two
finger
head
very
soapy
lacing
nose
buttery
sweetness
faint
grassy
hops
taste
grass
mineral
sweet
dough
finish
drying
aspirin
like
low
to
medium
carbonation
drinkability
is
pretty
good
but
dryness
of
finish
in
mouthfeel
gets
old
after
awhile
a
satisfying
medium
fullness
here
to
the
lager
flavors
with
a
light
and
crisp
feel
surly
sure
picked
an
easy
drinking
one
to
put
in
a
16
oz
can
i
think
ill
go
have
another
d
the
fairly
mild
and
overall
nonoffensive
flavors
of
this
beer
combined
with
the
light
mouthfeel
make
it
a
very
easy
drinker
im
generally
not
a
big
lager
fan
and
this
beer
certainly
didnt
change
my
mind
that
said
it
was
pretty
good
and
very
nice
to
have
tried
surly
has
yet
to
dissapoint
my
first
of
a
4pack
received
from
mothman
thanks
ben
this
is
clear
golden
colored
a
surpise
as
i
expected
some
cloudiness
in
the
zwickel
style
big
rocky
head
that
had
a
dryappearing
surface
the
beer
smelled
a
little
grainy
and
not
too
different
from
several
popular
lagers
maybe
a
little
floral
hops
but
mainly
grain
same
with
the
taste
delicately
sweet
and
malty
not
exactly
rich
but
just
about
right
for
a
lager
this
goes
down
like
water
hard
to
imagine
much
better
drinkability
overall
a
well
done
lager
id
have
liked
more
haze
or
other
evidence
of
the
unfiltered
production
but
tasty
and
made
to
the
style
in
every
other
way
overall
a
very
drinkable
and
refreshing
beer
good
for
a
summer
afternoon
d
great
like
a
standard
euro
lager
really
which
is
good
i
suppose
but
at
the
same
time
not
first
off
let
me
thank
tytoanderso
for
throwing
way
more
than
he
needed
to
into
the
box
of
surly
beers
this
came
in
i
poured
this
straight
in
to
a
guinness
pint
glass
and
was
not
disappointed
by
the
results
i
got
a
clear
golden
colored
beer
with
a
stunning
white
head
that
froths
and
sticks
for
quite
some
time
smell
is
very
doughy
like
freshly
baked
bread
and
malt
same
thing
comes
through
in
the
taste
mainly
bread
but
some
hint
of
fruit
here
and
there
feel
is
light
refreshing
and
really
drinkable
it
is
really
cool
to
see
surly
tackling
a
lighter
style
of
beer
like
this
and
putting
their
own
spin
on
it
an
excellent
session
beer
that
went
well
with
pizza
cheers
drinkability
who
would
have
thought
a
light
lager
could
pack
this
much
flavor
surly
did
overall
probably
the
best
light
beer
i
have
ever
had
it
has
so
much
flavor
for
such
a
light
beer
very
drinkable
i
will
have
not
problem
with
my
can
i
highly
recommend
this
if
you
dont
like
light
lagers
because
i
dont
and
i
love
this
one
the
ultimate
lawnmower
beer
a
very
good
beer
this
is
something
that
should
be
slipped
to
devoted
macro
drinkers
to
begin
to
shimmy
them
over
to
the
dark
side
and
they
would
like
it
ive
never
been
able
to
tell
the
difference
between
a
helles
and
a
kellerbier
but
i
would
call
this
a
helles
if
i
had
to
pick
that
said
if
this
was
available
locally
i
would
buy
it
again
and
again
during
the
summer
and
i
would
slap
myself
in
the
hand
anytime
i
ever
reached
for
pbr
again
overall
a
wonderful
addition
to
their
lineup
this
is
damn
near
a
perfect
summer
brew
i
could
have
drank
ten
of
these
without
batting
an
eye
it
was
just
that
smooth
go
get
this
one
i
get
lemon
and
slight
breadiness
in
the
taste
buds
though
im
not
picking
up
as
much
of
that
bready
malt
as
i
thought
i
would
this
is
very
refreshing
but
i
have
to
admit
isnt
doing
a
whole
lot
for
me
carbonation
is
good
and
this
is
very
quaffable
but
im
not
floored
like
i
have
been
with
other
surly
offerings
perhaps
this
should
have
been
paired
with
food
happy
for
the
opportunity
but
i
wont
be
seeking
any
out
any
more
down
the
line
this
is
an
easy
drinking
lager
from
surly
it
could
be
a
crossover
beer
for
the
nonbeer
advocate
crowd
but
still
gives
some
interesting
flavor
for
the
more
discerning
palettes
d
strong
gimme
more
i
would
order
another
and
definitely
buy
another
four
pack
or
two
i
do
see
what
all
the
fuss
was
about
this
is
a
beer
to
be
tracked
down
and
enjoyed
on
a
warm
day
in
the
sun
drinkability
is
out
of
this
world
very
drinkable
highly
recommended
thanks
to
arsenal04
personally
id
like
to
see
a
solid
german
beer
like
this
brewed
with
some
german
hops
instead
of
american
hops
and
id
like
to
see
the
malt
featured
even
moreso
over
the
hops
poured
into
a
pint
glass
this
beer
left
a
one
finger
head
that
took
a
couple
minutes
to
dissipate
which
left
a
thin
frothy
layer
on
top
the
beer
is
a
darkerthani
thoughtitwouldbe
yellow
with
orange
hues
the
can
boasts
fresh
bread
aroma
and
its
very
apparent
as
the
smell
reminds
me
of
driving
past
my
hometowns
bread
factory
i
also
pick
up
what
i
believe
to
be
lemon
that
is
lurking
in
the
backdrop
interesting
malts
are
very
dominate
after
the
first
taste
of
this
beer
what
i
find
rather
pleasant
is
that
i
detect
some
citrus
flavors
as
well
the
beer
has
a
unique
aftertaste
that
reminds
me
of
a
saison
very
light
feel
to
it
that
is
easy
to
drink
even
chug
if
i
was
thirsty
overall
a
solid
beer
that
matched
my
expectations
going
in
drinkability
hell
yeah
this
is
a
damn
tasty
beer
with
a
moderate
abv
and
a
crisp
clean
taste
that
makes
it
very
easy
to
do
a
session
with
i
had
a
few
off
the
tap
and
they
went
down
very
easily
total
session
beer
these
would
go
down
all
night
long
without
question
great
beer
d
this
is
an
exceptional
lager
im
not
super
familiar
with
the
style
but
it
is
definitely
one
i
want
more
of
this
beer
is
the
epitome
of
drinkability
this
should
be
a
summer
seasonal
for
surly
it
would
be
in
my
fridge
all
summer
long
a
great
companion
on
golf
outings
and
fishing
trips
or
just
after
a
night
mowing
the
lawn
which
i
should
get
around
to
this
beer
pours
a
clear
spun
gold
color
the
head
is
one
inch
in
height
and
recedes
slowly
into
nice
sticky
lacing
the
aroma
very
bready
slightly
spicy
and
has
a
nice
faint
metallic
thing
going
on
that
reminds
me
of
a
lot
of
good
beers
i
drank
while
living
in
germany
for
a
golden
lager
this
beer
has
a
very
robust
aroma
the
taste
is
as
bready
as
the
aroma
with
a
hop
presence
that
is
noticeable
but
certainly
plays
second
fiddle
to
the
malt
the
nice
metallic
taste
from
the
aroma
is
present
in
the
taste
too
again
like
the
aroma
the
taste
is
larger
than
one
would
expect
from
a
golden
lager
the
mouthfeel
is
medium
bodied
with
lively
carbonation
and
a
smooth
texture
overall
this
is
a
very
nice
beer
it
is
sessionable
flavorful
and
has
good
complexity
in
more
taste
and
aroma
i
would
really
like
to
see
surly
making
this
into
a
yearround
beer
stellar
drinkability
very
rounded
brew
it
sucks
that
it
will
only
be
available
for
a
week
or
two
i
could
drink
this
on
the
daily
d
this
is
yet
another
unique
brew
from
omar
and
the
guys
its
excellent
and
i
wish
they
would
have
brewed
more
of
it
definitely
a
great
session
brew
medium
bodied
and
medium
carbonation
this
beer
is
well
made
and
very
drinkable
dhighly
drinkable
tasty
an
accessible
example
of
the
style
while
still
slightly
pushing
the
boundary
in
typical
surly
fashion
this
is
an
exceptional
summer
lager
made
in
right
here
in
good
old
mn
so
fresh
so
tasty
so
nicely
balanced
so
damn
good
went
to
my
local
store
to
buy
a
4pak
of
furious
and
what
do
i
see
helll
in
4paks
on
the
shelf
i
did
not
think
surly
was
canning
this
of
course
i
bought
a
4pak
of
a
style
that
is
not
my
favorite
but
this
is
surly
ok
it
pours
a
golden
yellow
with
a
really
fresh
head
it
smells
of
noble
hops
and
sweet
malts
really
smooth
the
taste
is
the
same
its
a
good
version
of
the
style
bready
and
malty
with
a
smooth
hop
bite
this
is
not
a
hop
bomb
but
a
good
entry
for
1st
time
surly
drinkers
i
wont
buy
this
very
often
but
will
recommend
trying
because
it
is
tops
in
its
style
very
clear
light
gold
body
small
white
head
tops
it
off
sweet
pils
malts
dominate
the
nose
some
grassy
notes
as
well
very
sweet
taste
bready
and
grassy
bit
of
bitter
hops
rounds
it
out
pretty
lively
on
the
tongue
wet
and
thin
mouth
quite
a
tasty
brew
wish
they
would
keep
it
around
d
very
high
this
is
a
surly
beer
for
everyone
really
nothing
special
about
it
and
sort
of
rediculous
due
to
the
hype
that
surrounded
the
release
i
would
prolly
not
buy
it
again
if
it
came
out
regularly
just
because
its
so
plain
for
the
price
still
a
good
beer
though
this
august
surly
and
summit
both
released
an
unassuming
german
beer
style
and
hit
home
runs
with
their
helleszwickel
and
kolsch
respectively
i
want
to
face
them
off
against
each
other
to
see
which
is
better
i
really
dont
know
who
would
win
while
surly
did
a
fantastic
job
here
i
have
to
commend
summit
for
standing
up
to
surlys
challenge
to
the
minnesota
craft
beer
scene
great
brew
surly
you
fooled
me
into
liking
lagers
again
drinkability
great
nice
easy
drinking
lager
that
does
manage
to
not
be
totally
lame
and
bland
nice
and
malty
with
the
slightest
kiss
of
hops
that
i
really
enjoyed
it
was
very
drinkable
and
could
easily
be
sessioned
for
hours
and
hours
without
getting
crucified
for
blasphemy
this
would
be
an
excellent
beer
for
sunday
morning
bloody
beers
tasty
football
beer
that
accompanied
my
potato
pancakes
wonderfully
did
it
knock
me
over
with
flavor
no
but
i
didnt
really
expect
it
to
it
was
malty
balanced
and
refreshing
i
am
sad
that
is
likely
the
only
glass
i
will
get
but
im
glad
i
searched
5
places
for
it
the
drinkability
of
this
beer
is
high
it
is
a
beer
that
i
would
consider
lawnmower
beer
yet
fully
flavored
you
can
hand
this
to
a
lagerlover
and
win
them
over
lots
of
heat
with
this
one
and
it
is
good
too
overall
my
wife
who
is
a
miller
lite
fan
and
tells
me
she
is
really
trying
to
like
my
beers
loved
this
one
i
ordered
her
a
8oz
hell
she
ordered
a
12oz
firey
hell
with
the
meal
overall
this
is
a
nicely
approachable
chili
pepper
beer
from
the
very
first
sippable
pull
of
the
liquid
into
your
mouth
the
spicy
oiliness
becomes
apparent
by
the
end
of
the
sip
you
can
find
some
relatively
decent
heat
packed
into
the
flavor
this
is
particularly
true
of
the
aftertaste
which
tends
to
linger
even
after
it
is
long
gone
from
the
palate
the
pepper
which
seems
commercially
comparable
to
a
smoky
habanero
even
though
it
isnt
builds
nicely
upon
the
basic
base
munich
helles
malt
profile
it
actually
improves
the
base
rather
than
muddying
it
or
obscuring
it
you
keep
that
bittered
crisp
grain
profile
which
deviates
from
many
hotter
chili
beers
that
try
to
meet
the
heat
with
more
of
a
sweeter
cream
ale
style
grain
profile
or
a
hoppier
wash
dont
expect
a
beer
like
crime
or
punishment
to
kick
you
to
the
curb
take
in
the
milder
heat
enjoying
it
for
what
it
is
this
is
german
and
minnesotan
and
welldone
good
on
you
surly
othought
this
was
very
good
not
a
big
pepper
fan
but
i
liked
this
one
its
worth
a
try
fir
sure
i
like
the
base
beer
a
lot
in
many
of
the
pepper
beers
ive
had
by
other
brewers
the
pepper
and
usually
its
heat
overwhelms
the
base
beer
instead
of
harmonizing
with
it
here
the
pepper
is
nicely
integrated
it
is
quite
strong
but
it
isnt
too
fiery
nor
is
it
overwhelming
i
dont
like
it
as
much
as
hell
on
its
own
but
it
is
interesting
and
it
is
wellmade
overall
i
like
this
better
than
hell
i
thought
the
peppers
and
oak
barrels
made
this
beer
a
bit
more
complex
id
drink
more
of
this
if
its
around
i
had
it
on
tap
last
night
at
the
blue
nile
i
had
very
little
to
no
nose
of
the
pepper
infusion
i
had
a
minor
intial
taste
of
pepper
the
heat
was
subtle
in
the
front
but
it
had
a
more
pronounced
heat
in
the
finish
that
lingered
a
few
minutes
it
was
a
very
good
beer
however
if
i
had
more
than
the
small
portion
in
the
flight
im
unsure
how
long
it
would
take
to
finish
it
probably
didnt
help
that
i
had
heat
with
the
food
prior
hands
down
one
of
the
best
beers
for
pairing
with
pizza
a
great
option
for
food
pairing
from
acadias
flier
blah
blah
about
hell
and
then
cask
conditioned
and
aged
on
hickory
wood
and
puya
chiles
for
a
slow
burn
on
the
back
of
the
tongue
4
5
abv
12
degrees
plato
20
ibu
overall
the
spice
whacks
the
tongue
but
this
is
pretty
good
if
you
like
extreme
flavors
a
nice
kick
to
the
base
hell
beer
would
easily
stand
up
to
a
spicy
mexican
dish
definitely
a
fest
novelty
that
i
would
not
particularly
want
to
purchase
in
4pack
cans
but
will
try
whenever
it
makes
an
appearance
overall
i
found
another
weltenburger
outlet
in
southern
california
mattern
sausage
in
orange
carries
the
stuff
this
is
good
news
as
weltenburger
is
not
available
at
bevmo
total
wine
of
high
times
this
is
a
very
nice
lager
the
flavor
is
subdued
yet
complex
absolutely
chugable
my
only
issue
with
this
beer
is
that
i
wish
it
were
a
bit
more
aggressive
a
good
german
lager
tastes
of
husky
grains
and
leafy
hops
hay
some
citrus
and
a
little
bit
of
white
bread
clean
tasty
and
thirst
quenching
45
this
one
was
another
really
good
beer
from
weltenburg
definitely
a
brewery
that
seems
to
constantly
deliver
for
me
and
this
one
was
no
exception
the
beer
was
very
smooth
and
really
easy
to
drink
the
palate
being
a
particular
highlight
but
the
taste
and
smell
were
not
back
either
very
refreshing
and
with
some
good
fruits
and
citrus
coming
through
as
well
this
one
was
a
great
beer
and
one
well
worth
picking
up
this
is
unlike
any
helles
i
have
ever
had
and
probably
goes
somewhere
else
for
5
6
abv
the
result
though
is
really
memorable
absolutely
love
it
o
another
excellent
helles
if
you
see
it
buy
it
and
guzzle
it
down
as
soon
as
it
is
cold
i
really
love
this
beer
but
cant
get
over
how
different
the
taste
is
from
the
smell
i
so
wanna
make
some
sort
of
obama
joke
but
alas
the
spellings
just
dont
mesh
anyway
this
stuff
pours
a
mostly
clear
lemonstraw
topped
by
a
finger
of
white
foam
the
nose
comprises
barley
mild
flowers
and
a
strong
twinge
of
lemon
rind
that
shocks
from
the
start
through
to
the
middle
not
unlike
a
bolt
of
pain
from
the
sciatic
nerve
when
that
uppity
ganglion
group
gets
grumpy
the
taste
brings
in
more
of
the
same
with
a
stronger
sense
of
lemon
but
one
that
is
simultaneously
milder
softer
less
rindy
a
vein
of
lightlybuttered
biscuit
pervades
in
a
constant
undertow
providing
a
nice
semicounterpunch
to
the
lightlyfruity
aspects
the
body
is
a
light
medium
with
a
light
moderate
carbonation
and
a
lightly
creamy
feel
overall
an
enjoyable
helles
something
i
could
see
drinking
regularly
with
ease
golden
colour
clear
medium
fading
head
good
lacing
aroma
was
initially
reminiscent
of
a
premium
lager
but
this
gave
way
to
malt
and
vanilla
and
later
yeast
and
berries
tasted
toasted
honey
orange
malt
hints
of
grain
and
wheat
finish
was
sharp
wheaty
and
slightly
bitter
texture
slightly
thick
heavy
carbonation
resulted
in
a
coarse
edge
overall
this
was
more
of
an
export
than
a
helles
as
it
had
that
slightly
in
your
face
character
was
impressed
by
the
depth
which
was
better
than
normal
drinkability
a
good
beer
in
the
style
munich
helles
lager
o
i
really
enjoyed
this
brew
ive
had
quite
a
few
munich
helles
lagers
lately
and
this
was
the
most
enjoyable
o
an
ok
beer
i
got
this
as
a
gift
so
i
cant
complain
to
much
but
not
something
i
would
spend
money
on
i
may
just
be
a
weakling
but
does
anybody
else
think
they
oughtta
make
large
drinking
vessels
with
two
handles
instead
of
one
poured
a
luminous
gold
with
two
fingers
of
white
fluffy
head
laces
well
on
my
oversized
pilsner
glass
smell
of
yeasty
malt
and
lemongrass
not
a
lot
on
the
nose
smooth
malty
flavor
with
a
bit
of
lemony
citrus
sweetness
nice
vague
hop
bitterness
on
the
back
of
the
tongue
bubbly
and
light
mouthfeel
very
drinkable
extremely
refreshing
great
pizza
or
pretzel
beer
this
would
be
a
good
stepping
off
point
to
get
your
bmc
friends
to
try
something
new
o
overall
nice
level
of
drinkability
not
much
to
hold
you
back
here
making
for
an
easy
brainless
downer
helles
is
a
style
not
often
given
the
respect
and
craftmenship
it
deserves
and
this
fairs
worthy
to
good
by
style
my
gold
standard
for
such
continues
to
be
hacker
pschorrs
munich
gold
overall
an
impressive
polished
lager
with
a
great
floral
hop
character
perhaps
thats
what
the
baroque
label
refers
to
very
nicely
done
o
a
decent
session
beer
medium
bodied
and
fuller
than
expected
with
a
nice
balance
of
bready
yeast
crisp
light
fruit
biscuitpale
malt
earthy
hops
grass
and
straw
there
is
a
nice
crisp
floral
hop
bite
up
front
that
lingers
throughout
over
the
sweeter
malt
apple
and
pear
notes
into
a
dry
finish
o
really
easy
to
drink
and
really
clean
and
pleasant
d
not
a
bad
helles
but
just
not
my
cup
of
tea
light
orange
with
a
dense
white
head
with
excellent
retention
and
nice
lacing
this
is
what
id
expect
from
a
good
helles
maybe
just
a
touch
of
haze
the
nose
is
decent
surprisingly
theres
a
little
sulfur
up
front
and
the
malt
character
is
very
rustic
with
a
raw
grainy
bouquet
theres
also
a
delicate
hop
character
light
and
with
earthy
aroma
not
the
cleanest
of
lagers
theres
a
touch
of
yeast
here
reminding
me
of
a
kellerbier
im
initially
disappointed
but
this
is
really
growing
on
me
and
part
of
the
reason
for
this
the
reason
it
tastes
delicate
and
complex
this
is
a
joy
to
drink
light
earthy
hop
flavor
with
a
little
lemon
as
well
theres
a
firm
bitterness
that
balances
the
malt
flavors
here
rustic
a
little
bready
and
with
a
touch
of
cotton
candy
this
is
top
notch
drying
on
the
finish
with
a
firm
bitterness
a
little
earth

nice
beer
i
love
this
style
and
so
it
had
a
leg
up
to
start
but
this
is
a
good
and
very
fresh
brew
the
only
flaw
being
perhaps
that
it
lacks
quite
enough
bite
and
bitterness
the
body
was
nicely
clean
and
round
drinkability
was
terrific
i
could
easily
spend
a
nice
long
day
with
this
brew
overall
a
wonderful
example
of
the
style
a
must
try
when
you
see
it
overall
a
decent
lager
but
nothing
ultra
special
here
besides
the
taste
d
outstanding
im
gonna
remember
this
one
every
time
i
get
a
craving
for
a
good
bavarian
helles
whatever
it
is
its
a
good
helles
it
is
very
close
to
a
czech
pilsener
but
does
have
less
hops
spicearoma
and
more
malt
to
it
its
cleaner
and
crispier
than
a
german
lager

a

extremely
light
extremely
delicious
in
the
first

it
hits
the

the
beer
is
straight

style
with
a
neutral

yet
it
still
manages
to
have
a
very
mild

a
crisp

i
think
i
found
my
summer
beer
while
its
not
my
favorite
example
of
this
style
this
one
was
quite
good
however
if
its
on
the
shelf
next
to
weihenstephaner
original
im
grabbing
that
d
a
nice
beer
a
little
more
hop
character
would
make
a
great
brew
nonetheless
a
step
up
from
the
urtyp
hell
i
had
last
week
drinkability
very
enjoyable
all
around
beer
nice
flavors
scents
and
easily
drinkable
this
would
be
a
great
transition
beer
for
bmc
drinkers
the
taste
is
also
very
nice
a
solid
lively
helles
character
with
plenty
of
bread
honey
herbs
and
lemon
its
lively
and
crisp
however
the
feel
is
a
little
on
the
thin
side
slightly
watery
pours
a
hazy
golden
yellow
color
with
a
white
head
in
the
aroma
a
small
dryness
and
a
fruity
white
grapeish
smell
in
the
taste
just
like
the
aroma
dry
fruitiness
with
white
grape
being
the
the
biggest
flavor
a
smooth
and
medium
to
small
bodied
mouthfeel
and
a
dry
lager
like
aftertaste
nice
fruitiness
and
quite
smooth
nice
lager
drinkability
is
high
this
is
an
awesome
lager
wow
i
dont
drink
many
lagers
but
in
the
last
few
days
ive
had
some
of
the
best
ive
ever
had
one
local
and
this
one
from
bavaria
pretty
much
the
opposite
side
of
the
world
the
only
ding
on
drinkability
is
this
isnt
the
cheapest
by
the
bottle
although
it
was
honestly
pretty
much
the
same
price
as
the
draft
keller
bier
i
was
referring
to
from

up
to
the

a
solid
german

this
is
a
very
enjoyable
helles
and
quite
sessionable
if
needed
smooth
creamy
balanced
and
refreshing
recommended
drinkability
is
high
if
you
like
german
lagers
a
good
beer
to
be
sure
but
not
something
to
seek
out
unless
german
beer
is
really
your
thing
md
while
its
clean
and
crisp
on
the
mouthfeel
the
carbonation
also
remains
pretty
restrained
and
not
too
lively
the
superior
texture
plus
little
sign
of
alc
makes
this
stronger
version
of
helles
a
pleasant
beer
to
quaff
i
cant
think
of
anything
bad
about
this
lager
but
if
anything
its
the
slight
lack
of
character
considering
the
nice
balance
and
superbly
clean
flavour
profile
however
really
this
is
a
very
wellexecuted
product
poured
into
a
stange
this
beer
is
hazy
blondestraw
with
a
big
puffy
white
head
that
holds
well
the
smell
is
mostly
comprised
of
lemon
notes
and
grass
while
the
flavor
brings
out
more
of
the
same
maybe
a
little
too
much
puckering
lemon
actually
subtle
hop
bitterness
is
towards
the
back
and
the
beer
has
a
light
body
with
a
kiss
of
carbonation
solid
in
every
other
aspect
but
the
sweetness
makes
this
borderline
sessionable

in

it
is
very
good
a
sipper
in

it
would
be
ideal

that
i

d
man
if
they
sold

would

they
would

hit
the
spot

worth

try
this
beer
pours
a
hazy
gold
has
the
typical
head
that
one
would
expect
from
a
helles
and
it
left
tracing
down
the
glass
the
beer
had
a
midly
malty
flavor
though
not
overpowering
and
not
cloying
there
was
a
hint
of
hops
but
not
much
more

a
fine
example
of

it
grew
on

as
i
quaffed
very
subdued
and
mellow
in

really
a
treat
and
well
put

easily
a

it
held
my

till

i
was
dissapointed
to
have
to
move
on

beer
nothing

the

quite
like
a
good
german
lager
overall
this
proved
to
quite
drinkable
and
enjoyable
one
of
this

id
be

come

it
almost
smells
like
a
sweet
fruit
juice
the
taste
is
light
and
sweet
not
a
great
finish
slightly
sticky
and
unsatisfying
very
easy
beer
to
drink
though
and
i
could
see
myself
enjoying
a
good
number
of
these
nothing
exciting
in
the
flavor
department
just
some
sweet
malts
and
a
little
bit
of
hops
in
the
finish
its
pleasant
to
drink
though
and
definitely
would
be
a
great
session
beer
the
hops
in
the
finish
is
what
hit
me
as
making
it
highly
drinkable
it
keeps
just
interesting
enough
to
be
happy
wow
this
beer
pours
a
very
very
light
pale
straw
color
almost
looks
like
it
has

is
not

to

about
this
beer
really
sort
of
nondescript
vaguely
memorable
a
very
restrained
beer
subtle
but
somehow
this
a
really
great
drinking
beer
a
triumph
of
the
gentle
touch
f
a
little
thinner
than
i
like
but
still
very
good
really
good
on

a

one
of
the
best

beers
ever
bottle
of

lager
drank

munich
helles
lager
easily
and
cheaply
found
in
these
parts
great

easy
drinking
beer
not
too
sweet
not
too
filling
i
am
sure
on
draft
unpasteurized
it
would
be
even
better
enjoy
really
bright
clear
somewhat
goldenish
color
smell
is
the
weak
point
for
this
because
it
had
a
very
small
hint
of
skunkiness
green
bottle
tastes
very
refreshing
and
is
incredibly
smooth
and
easy
to
drink
i
could
seriously
drink
this
stuff
like
water
not
usually
a
seeker
of
german
pale
lagers
but
when
i
have
to
drink
one
it
might
as
well
be
spaten
its
so
light
and
clean
one
could
literally
consume
a
dozen
of
these
in
an
afternoon
with
little
consequence
blonde
and
bright
nice
and
fizzy
refreshing
and
really
clean
in
the
finish
enjoying
the
hops
on
it
more
than
others
and
the
yeast
is
an
absolute
classic
often
found
skunked
out
in
the
market
because
of
the
green
glass
but
when
fresh
this
really
is
an
excellent
lager
distinct
from
the
others
in
its
class
i
think
and
pleasantly
flavorful
for
what
it
is
often
the
best
beer
available
at
non
craft
spots
o
a
little
light
struck
but
still
a
really
nice
beer
quite
a
nice
lager
without
really
doing
much
to
stand
out
from
the
crowd
being
from
germany
is
almost
enough
to
elevate
it
above
most
lagers
youre
likely
to
try
in
the
uk
but
it
is
by
no
means
a
classic
it
had
enough
going
for
it
to
keep
you
interested
and
the
crisp
finish
was
particularly
pleasing
but
its
not
a
beer
id
go
out
of
my
way
to
track
down
again
smells
like
grass
tastes
like
lemongrass
fresh
and
crisp
but
couldnt
get
past
the
strange
hop
flavor
integrated
into
the
brew
cheers
everything
a
lager
should
be
this
beer
feels
light
but
with
great
carbonation
felt
in
your
mouth
which
leaves
a
really
nice
finish
what
lagers
should
aspire
to
o
far
from
terrible
far
from
great
its
not
a
beer
ill
buy
again
because
we
import
so
much
better
from
the
region
but
its
also
a
serviceable
helles
with
an
interesting
hop
mix
of
grass
in
the
nose
and
black
pepper
on
the
tongue
good
beer
mmmmm
lager
now
if
you
want
a
good
lager
this
is
it
crisp
clean
and
lovely
but
dont
expect
it
to
be
an
ipa
smooth
yet
slightly
bitter
beer
without
too
much
bite
its
a
good

never

just
seems
right
to
me
and
i
would
be
hard

to

something

if
this
was
available
sometimes
you
just
want
a
beer
and
youd
be

to
find

great
lager
than
this
smooth

creamy
with
just
the
right
amount
of
crisp
hops
to
finish
it
off
its
a
shame
that
no
big
name
american
beer
even
resembles
something
this
good
o
i
think
its
unfortunate
that
the
irrational
craze
for
ales
especially
overthetop
ipas
over
the
last
few
years
has
left
the
traditional
lager
woefully
underappreciated
and
yet
the
truth
is
that
a
good
lager
is
mighty
difficult
to
brew
much
more
so
than
an
ale
well
this
is
damn
good
lager
refreshing
and
crisp
yet
simultaneously
hearty
great
stuff
you
see
how
the
germans
drink
this
stuff
by
the
liter
at
their
beer
halls
o
solid
beer
beach
beer
lawnmower
beer
summer
beer
enough
flavor
to
keep
ya
happy
while
being
a
thirst
quencher
i
forgot
how
much
i
liked
this
one
will
be
revisiting
again
this
was
very
reminiscent
of
heineken
but
skunkier
its
probably
due
to
the
duration
of
shipping
its
wasnt
particularly
great
but
ill
drink
it
if
its
available
i
wasnt
too
impressed
though
i
would
like
to
try
their
other
beers
for
sure

ive
had
this
beer
on
a
number
of
occasions
since
my
last
formal
review
since
its
one
of
my
everyday
great
drinking
beers
you
want
to
sit
down
with
a
beer
and
not
think
about
it
but
just
enjoy
it
this
might
beer
the
beer
for
you
anyway
i
havent
noticed
any
sort
of
metallicness
in
probably
the
last
ten
times
ive
had
this
so
this
score
deserves
a
half
point
bump
in
the
aroma
department
light
golden
color
with
a
smallish
white
head
that
dissipates
quickly
rich
bready
pilsner
malt
with
a
hint
of
carmelization
and
some
light
fruity
notes
dms
was
quite
evident
upon
first
pour
but
seems
to
have
mostly
dissipated
light
floral
hop
aroma
the
flavor
is
rich
toasty
sweet
bready
caramel
maltiness
with
a
hint
of
light
sweet
fruit
light
earthy
spicy
hop
flavor
with
a
light
level
of
hop
bitterness
medium
body
with
a
moderate
level
of
carbonation
and
a
sweet
rich
malty
mouthfeel
nice
flavorful
malt
forward
beer
the
dms
was
a
bit
heavy
at
first
im
glad
that
went
away
i
could
drink
many
of
these
given
half
a
chance
o
well
balanced
between
the
sweetness
of
the
malts
and
the
bitterness
of
the
hops
making
it
easy
to
drink
and
quite
enjoyable
a
classic
example
of
the
style
overall
this
is
of
the
highest
quality
lager
in
the
world
i
would
put
this
up
in
there
with
the
best
of
them
for
this
style
is
world
class
beer
the
verdict
pretty
good
beer
nothing
fancy
or
complex
just
a
good
solid
german
lager
overall
just
a
good
enjoyable
beer
nothing
world
class
but
its
just
solid
and
a
brew
i
think
almost
any
kind
of
palate
would
enjoy
middle
of
the
road
helles
nothing
too
remarkable
here
but
overall
a
decent
helles
appearance
is
lacking
some
color
pale
golden
and
head
very
spare
aroma
is
malt
taste
is
mostly
malt
hops
barely
make
an
appearance
here
much
better
to
be
found
in
germany
o
again
one
of
my
favorite
beers
overall
i
realize
that
lagers
get
a
bit
of
an
unfair
bummed
rap
around
here
but
you
have
to
remember
there
are
plenty
of
excellent
lagers
out
there
the
fact
that
most
crap
american
beers
are
lagers
plays
into
this
negative
stereotype
which
i
think
is
wrong
this
beer
has
a
perfect
amount
of
taste
and
refreshment
the
ultimate
and
my
favorite
session
beer
and
one
of
my
top
5
overall
highly
recommended
for
any
lager
fans
or
anyone
who
likes
to
session
with
quality
tasty
beer
the
texture
is
silky
smooth
with
some
prickly
carbonation
mediumbodied
this
is
a
refreshing
brew
its
smell
stands
out
the
most
just
like
a
lemon
drop
it
tastes
like
a
pilsner
but
it
has
a
hint
of
lemon
this
is
certainly
not
exciting
but
its
definitely
drinkable
i
might
get
this
again
certainly
not
the
most
exciting
lager
but
this
seems
like
a
good
standard
for
an
authentic
helles
its
refreshing
drinkable
and
not
offensive
good
cookout
beer
i
imagine
overall
this
is
a
good
beer
and
i
would
love
to
try
it
on
draft
i
wont
buy
it
in
bottles
again
for
the
life
of
me
i
cant
understand
that
if
the
germans
were
such
purists
why
they
kept
the
usage
of
green
bottles
the
skunk
detracts
from
the
beer
there
is
no
question
but
not
terribly
so
im
going
to
give
this
beer
high
3s
out
of
5
o
green
bottles
mean
i
wouldnt
buy
this
one
again
however
i
would
seek
it
out
on
tap
an
underappreciated
lager
unfortunately
scorned
both
by
its
bottle
color
and
by
who
makes
it
brewed
in
munich
this
is
another
delicious
germany
beer
simple
but
delicious
i
had
this
beer
a
lot
when
i
was
in
germany
and
thought
it
was
delicious
color
is
not
the
darkest
ive
seen
in
a
beer
but
was
also
not
the
lightest
clean
fullbodied
flavor
very
very
tasty
brew
this
beer
to
me
exemplifies
a
german
premium
lager
its
an
excellent
beer
rich
tasty
highly
drinkable
poured
on
tap
in
a
shaker
at
the
pantry
minus
the
green
food
coloring
offered
due
to
st
pattys
crisp
golden
color
like
a
mildly
tarnished
golden
wedding
band
with
a
cap
of
thick
white
head
that
kept
pretty
good
retention
and
a
touch
of
lacing
smelled
a
lot
of
biscuit
mix
freshly
kneaded
in
the
kitchen
from
several
feet
away
as
well
as
a
touch
of
some
citrus
the
citrus
came
out
more
pronounced
in
the
taste
and
mouthfeel
almost
like
a
bit
of
lime
zest
andor
rind
along
the
back
of
a
bready
malt
the
mouthfeel
was
pretty
light
and
just
a
very
small
touch
of
carbonation
and
spritz
pretty
good
for
a
lager
overall
o
here
we
see
a
high
quality
beer
that
encompasses
everything
i
look
for
in
a
lager
it
hits
all
the
high
notes
you
expect
out
of
a
quality
lagerthe
very
qualities
that
are
absent
from
mainstream
lagers
popular
in
america
today
i
will
stock
up
on
these
around
the
summer
months
as
something
this
refreshing
cant
be
passed
up
overall
this
makes
a
good
beer
to
drink
when
you
just
want
to
drink
a
few
beers
and
not
think
about
it
balanced
and
refreshing
solid
overall
very
good
quality
lager
i
thought
it
must
have
been
a
light
ale
or
a
pilsener
au80
a
case
for
2
x
500ml
not
bad
value
at
all
for
such
a
good
quality
lager
overall
spaten
premium
lager
is
a
decent
beer
to
try
its
not
my
favorite
style
but
i
could
see
myself
getting
an
itch
that
this
style
could
scratch
on
occasion
i
dont
think
i
would
buy
it
the
majority
of
the
time
however
its
a
good
lighter
choice
for
when
you
dont
want
to
sacrifice
taste
like
some
other
coughamericanmacrolagerscough
light
choices
o
an
average
german
lager
that
drinks
easily
overall
great
beer
to
have
over
and
over
again
am
easy
go
to
and
one
of
the
best
failsafes
that
you
can
rely
on
salud
o
good
drinkability
an
authentic
bavarian
lager
good
session
beer
o
great
lager
worth
trying
bitterness
lingers
for
a
long
time
full
of
great
clean
taste
overall
this
is
a
kind
of
beer
that
i
could
drink
all
night
or
at
a
cookout
very
light
and
clean
just
not
much
going
on
with
it
i
pretty
much
love
all
of
spatens
recipes
this
pours
nicely
laces
in
little
spots
and
smells
very
pilsnerly
lager
smells
hoppy
tastes
very
dr
finishes
clean
with
a
crisp
taste
nice
session
beer
dry
a
little
bitter
very
germany
wish
they
would
bring
back
the
clubweisse
o
pretty
good
stuff
very
clean
and
nothing
offputting
at
all
o
this
beer
is
very
well
balanced
between
the
malt
and
hops
and
is
also
quite
easy
to
drink
o
munich
helles
lagers
done
right
are
some
of
my
favorite
lagers
for
summer
that
being
said
this
helles
is
done
to
near
perfection
pick
up
a
six
pack
for
yourself
and
enjoy
a
summer
afternoon
or
two
or
three
poured
from
a
bottle
into
a
lager
glass
pours
a
dark
yellow
in
color
with
a
three
finger
head
quite
nice
i
guess
though
nothing
special
pretty
much
smells
of
any
other
lager
including
adjuncts
with
some
strong
skunkiness
coming
through
taste
is
realistically
no
better
than
a
pbr
except
with
some
very
slight
fruitiness
the
mouthfeel
is
pretty
much
the
same
as
the
taste
with
no
additional
flavors
coming
through
however
it
is
not
harsh
at
all
overall
its
a
pretty
average
beer
nothing
worth
buying
in
my
opinion
i
got
the
bottle
for
free
so
i
cannot
complain
overall
i
thought
this
was
an
ok
beer
and
a
slightly
above
average
example
of
a
munich
helles
lager
it
had
just
about
everything
that
i
look
for
in
the
style
but
the
skunkyness
prevented
it
from
being
as
good
as
it
could
be
this
beer
had
pretty
good
drinkability
it
was
smooth
but
the
flavors
couldnt
quite
hold
my
attention
but
i
could
still
drink
two
or
three
of
these
if
in
the
mood
what
i
liked
most
about
this
beer
was
the
mouthfeel
it
was
true
to
style
and
just
where
it
should
be
no
complaints
there
what
i
liked
least
about
this
beer
was
the
fact
that
it
was
a
little
skunky
i
think
thats
from
the
green
bottle
these
older
brewerys
that
still
use
green
bottles
need
to
get
with
the
times
i
might
have
this
beer
again
if
i
was
looking
for
a
sessionable
lager
but
i
would
be
more
inclined
to
revisit
this
again
on
draft
its
got
to
go
great
with
brats
this
beer
made
for
an
ok
first
impression
for
spaten
and
i
would
be
interested
to
try
more
of
their
beers
but
you
can
be
sure
that
i
will
be
a
little
leery
if
they
are
in
the
same
green
bottle
good
brew
it
just
needs
better
packaging
thin
head
on
a
clear
straw
body
a
little
lemon
custard
with
pale
malts
but
overall
very
light
flavor
is
a
touch
bitter
with
more
pale
malts
and
grains
but
very
simple
no
off
putting
aftertaste
light
body
and
moderate
to
high
carbonation
overall
drinkable
but
simple
not
bad
not
great
got
a
case
on
clearance
for
20
and
was
psyched
to
try
this
highly
esteemed
lager
maybe
its
the
fact
that
ive
been
accustomed
to
americanized
lagers
but
i
was
astounded
by
the
syrupy
quality
this
beer
has
in
aftertaste
it
poured
a
golden
color
with
a
generous
foamy
head
into
my
pilsner
glass
in
look
and
in
taste
it
reminded
me
if
yuengling
premium
which
im
not
above
drinking
but
it
is
what
it
is
decent
beer
but
it
didnt
give
me
an
exceptional
vibe
taste
is
definitely
malty
sweet
but
crisp
and
light
a
perfect
thirst
quencher
for
hot
summer
days
and
aside
from
the
aroma
a
solid
lager
this
is
a
decent
quaffable
smooth
decently
flavored
beer
it
does
have
the
typical
characteristics
of
a
euro
lager
but
the
hop
character
and
grain
bill
do
a
good
job
of
overcoming
it
its
worth
a
try
overall
not
a
great
beer
but
for
a
minikeg
on
a
huge
occasion
it
works
especially
at
a
nice
price
but
really
disappointing
apparently
a
classic
their
optimator
doppelbock
still
floors
me
to
this
day
but
this
manages
to
hold
on
its
own
as
an
excellent
product
totally
worth
buying
six
packs
to
pair
with
pretty
much
any
meal
pours
a
clear
light
orange
with
a
1
inch
foamy
offwhite
head
that
settles
to
a
film
on
top
of
the
beer
thin
broken
rings
of
lace
form
around
the
glass
on
the
drink
down
smell
is
of
grain
grape
juice
and
some
slightly
skunky
aromas
that
disappear
after
the
pour
taste
is
of
sweet
maltgrain
and
some
grape
juice
and
fruity
flavors
there
is
a
slight
hop
bitterness
that
quickly
fades
after
each
sip
there
is
a
lower
level
of
carbonation
with
a
slightly
crisp
and
medium
bodied
mouthfeel
overall
this
is
a
good
and
easy
to
drink
lager
that
is
pretty
refreshing
in
general
a
good
light
german
lager
with
a
very
clean
taste
o
a
nice
thirst
quencher
on
a
hot
day
or
as
an
accompaniment
to
a
warm
meal
a
good
example
of
a
lager
spaten
premium
pours
nicely
with
a
thick
foamy
head
and
in
a
bar
clean
class
had
good
retention
and
lovely
lacing
it
is
best
served
chilled
at
cellar
temps
not
ice
cold
the
nose
is
subtle
but
does
have
nice
malt
presence
and
subtle
sourdough
bread
notes
the
perfect
goldenyellow
is
what
you
would
expect
from
a
munich
helles
and
is
nicely
effervescent
but
not
overly
carbonated
for
me
it
is
moderately
sweet
on
the
front
of
the
sip
and
leaves
no
off
flavor
aftertaste
but
finishes
clean
an
d
a
bit
wet
overall
an
excellent
example
of
an
everyday
german
lager
for
everyday
lager
drinkers
and
a
great
value
buy
a
5
liter
mini
keg
and
enjoy
while
grilling
some
brats
o
not
too
bad
def
lives
up
to
the
hype
that
i
recall
of
good
german
beer
from
my
college
days
o
havent
had
this
in
years
but
pretty
much
as
expected
works
best
with
food
overall
this
brew
is
not
very
complicated
its
straight
forward
and
easy
to
appreciate
perfect
all
year
round
d
a
very
nice

plenty

munchner

premium

a

for

sauerkraut
recommended
normally
i
never
go
right
down
the
middle
on
my
reviews
but
this
is
an
exception
its
not
that
this
beer
is
not
good
it
is
that
it
is
not
really
remarkable
either
it
pours
a
very
average
light
seethrough
typical
color
of
what
you
would
expect
from
a
lager
it
has
the
carbonation
lace
and
head
of
a
lager
and
the
aroma
of
barley
and
hops
youd
expect
from
a
better
lager
the
beer
to
me
resembles
a
malt
liquor
in
terms
of
the
bitterness
and
dryness
and
it
is
evident
on
the
tongue
for
a
strong
mouthfeel
not
a
bad
brew
not
a
great
brew
i
would
drink
spaten
if
it
was
the
only
other
option
other
than
a
cheap
american
adjunct
lager
a
good
lager
that
was
a
pleasant
surprise
not
a
lager
fan
but
this
style
seems
to
appeal
to
me
would
definitely
grab
it
again
or
sip
a
few
next
octoberfest
notes
nice
beer
and
a
good
example
for
the
style
goes
down
easy
and
is
refreshing
decent
level
of
hops
to
contrast
with
the
maltiness
resulting
in
a
well
balanced
refreshing
beer
overall
very
drinkable
light
body
beer
that
lingers
slightly
great
beer
for
a
hot
afternoon
a
good
session
beer
and
a
definite
step
up
from
the
usual
lager
really
liked

there

this

for
anyone
who
loves
to

classic
american

such
as

will
love

is
neither
bitter
or
sweet
but
perfectly
balanced
the
color
of
the
beer
is
light
golden
and
has
a
malty
aroma
with
a
hint
of
lemon
very
transparent
light
straw
color
with
an
eggshell
white
foam
head
that
lasts
for
quite
some
time
but
leaves
minimal
lacing
aroma
at
first
whiff
reminds
of
apricots
and
tangerines
but
resolves
into
a
cracker
malt
with
strong
and
complex
herbal
floral
hopping
taste
is
somewhat
pushed
into
sweetness
but
not
unbearably
so
finish
is
semisweet
but
lasts
for
a
respectable
amount
of
time
texture
is
lighter
side
of
medium
body
refreshing
and
definitely
worth
sessioning
this
beer
is
a
relatively
average
lager
it
is
and
enjoyable
and
easy
beer
to
drink
the
color
is
a
light
golden
it
comes
in
a
green
bottle
with
a
neat
label
the
smell
is
wheaty
or
grassy
it
has
a
very
clean
finish
the
taste
is
very
balanced
neither
too
sweet
nor
too
bitter
there
is
a
slight
caramel
flavor
as
well
this
beer
is
similar
to
a
heineken
extra
didnt
particularly
care
for
this
beer
it
was
your
average
run
of
the
mill
beer
the
taste
was
identical
to
that
of
coors
or
heineken
this
beer
was
lighter
yellow
in
color
to
me
it
was
just
like
a
typically
standard
beer
what
you
think
of
when
you
hear
the
word
beer
it
has
an
herbal
almost
grassy
taste
and
was
pretty
smooth
not
my
favorite
but
what
i
did
like
about
this
beer
was
that
it
has
a
super
clean
finish
and
did
not
leave
a
horrible
after
taste
this
beer
comes
in
a
neat
green
bottles
with
a
cool
unique
logo
it
has
golden
color
light
brown
this
beer
has
just
about
no
head
another
neat
thing
is
the
carbonation
of
this
beer
it
reminds
me
of
champagne
thus
beer
smells
like
clean
cut
grass
it
has
a
sweet
malt
taste
and
a
clean
after
taste
this
beer
goes
down
smooth
and
is
a
classic
german
lager
o
ive
had
the
optimator
and
the
marzen
oktoberfest
and
i
was
a
little
disappointed
at
first
but
then
remembered
its
a
light
lager
and
should
be
judged
as
so
that
being
said
its
pretty
good
and
its
probably
not
nearly
as
fresh
as
the
domestics
being
in
the
middle
of
america
not
a
bad
drink
but
probably
needs
to
be
icy
cold
and
really
fresh
so
you
get
a
nice
froth
seems
to
be
all
about
the
perfume
of
the
hops
modestly
bitter
aftertaste
in
the
right
mood
this
could
be
fine
but
it
is
a
little
unusual
o
a
fine
beer
that
i
will
often
revisit
pairs
excellently
with
german
cuisine
watchin
jeopardy
and
drinkin
german
brews
good
times
this
one
pours
a
clear
pale
straw
topped
by
a
finger
of
relatively
shortlived
white
foam
the
nose
comprises
grass
flowers
light
wheat
and
a
very
light
twist
of
lemon
the
taste
takes
a
simpler
tack
rocking
just
wheat
and
flowers
almost
pilsnerlike
the
body
is
pretty
light
with
a
very
light
moderate
carbonation
and
a
smooth
feel
overall
a
decent
helles
lager
but
lacking
any
kind
of
real
character
any
kind
of
discerning
remarks
so
to
speak
its
nowhere
near
bad
just
not
something
i
would
aim
for
especially
with
other
quality
german
choices
around
this
beer
had
great
promise
i
was
told
by
the
owner
of
the
shop
i
bought
it
from
that
its
one
of
the
best
lagers
on
the
market
but
as
soon
as
i
smelled
it
i
knew
he
was
wrong
maybe
it
was
skunked
cause
this
thing
smelled
foul
good
color
loads
of
bubbles
look
was
great
mouthfeel
light
taste
was
ok
slightly
more
complex
than
a
bud
not
buying
this
again
not
asking
that
dude
what
he
reccomends
again
overall
a
nice
light
german
easy
drinker
a
very
clean
and
easy
drinking
beer
exactly
what
one
would
expect
of
the
style
easy
to
drink
and
i
could
see
myself
drinking
this
sort
of
brew
on
a
hot
summers
day
in
a
munich
bier
garden
o
its
not
as
good
as
the
spaten
dunkel
oktoberfest
or
optimator
but
a
very
nice
pale
lager
definitely
a
step
up
from
the
cheaper
european
lagers
like
becks
or
heineken
but
unless
youre
crazy
about
pale
lagers
id
recommend
one
of
spatens
darker
beers
instead
especially
now
in
october
overall
drinkability
its
not
a
bad
beer
perhaps
slightly
better
than
average
for
the
style
overall
this
is
great
stuff
i
wish
american
lagers
had
this
much

i
would

again
prost
d
solidly

brew
a
good
light
but
nonwimpy
brew
overall
impression
not
my
favorite
of
the
helles
lagers
but
still
brings
me
back
to
austriangerman
festival
days
easy
drinking
light
clean
and
bottoms
up
prost
o
a
nice
snappy
lager
easy
to
knock
back
a
few
and
a
great
alternative
if
your
looking
to
mix
it
up
o
good
not
outstanding
this
is
one
you
could
drink
all
day
at
a
barbeque
or
cookout
and
goes
quite
well
with
my
sisters
fried
chicken
she
cooks
it
like
my
mom
may
she
rest
in
peace
prost
this
is
a
classictasting
and
very
wellbalanced
lager
what
you
see
is
what
you
get
with
this
one
the
lack
of
surprises
or
significant
complexity
in
this
one
is
compensated
by
smoothness
and
solid
flavors
throughout
it
may
not
raise
many
eyebrows
but
it
really
does
everything
that
a
good
lager
should
overall
its
definitely
better
than
most
of
the
run
of
the
mill
eurobeers
out
there
but
there
are
a
few
other
beers
in
this
category
that
id
rather
be
drinking
o
the
germans
know
how
to
make
good
lagers
and
this
is
an
example
as
good
as
any
i
cant
complain
about
anything
maybe
it
misses
that
extra
thing
to
make
it
special
but
ill
bet
i
could
drink
this
on
most
occasions
as
most
german
lagers
it
doesnt
cost
much
either
the
feel
of
this
beer
is
pretty
crisp
and
has
the
signature
of
a
german
pilsner
there
is
a
bready
aftertaste
with
some
smooth
feel
as
this
goes
down
a
well
made
larger
that
would
got
well
with
some
pulled
pork
o
this
beer
is
average
at
best
it
feels
like
every
other
green
bottled
euro
beer
to
me
and
does
nothing
to
set
itself
apart
from
the
middle
of
the
road
the
cpj
rjt
overall
i
like
this
a
bit
better
than
the
hackerpschorr
i
just
had
much
more
cleaner
and
crisp
with
a
nice
hop
flavor
overall
a
pretty
boring
german
lager
not
much
character
to
it
flavors
are
subdued
to
the
point
of
being
almost
unnoticeable
compared
to
the
paulaner
pils
i
reviewed
yesterday
this
is
a
german
budweiser
this
is
yet
another
euro
beer
that
proves
that
most
american
beers
are
generations
away
from
the
fine
quality
enjoyable
beers
made
in
germany
belgium
and
england
i
use
this
often
as
a
celebration
beer
as
an
alternative
to
pacifico
my
regular
daily
beer
this
beer
was
a
pleasant
surprise
and
is
definitely
a
beer
i
would
drink
again
o
pretty
solid
beer
not
the
best
in
the
world
but
you
could
derfinately
do
worse
for
a
helles
o
good
lager
i
would
buy
it
again
for
lawn
mowing
purposes
o
i
think
this
beer
is
done
very
well
though
ill
probably
reconsider
the
overall
rating
once
ive
tried
more
from
this
style
overall
i
thought
i
wouldnt
feel
so
strongly
about
a
relatively
standard
plain
style
of
beer
but
this
is
perfect
right
now
i
have
been
craving
something
to
balance
out
the
range
of
overmalty
to
uberhoppy
beers
i
have
been
drinking
for
the
last
six
months
it
also
satisfies
a
nice
balance
between
hoppy
czech
my
usual
favorite
and
dry
german
pilsners
spaten
hits
the
spot
o
solid
example
of
this
style
can
be
consumed
in
copious
amounts
without
any
problems
have
experienced
this
on
tap
on
many
occasions
but
the
bottled
product
is
just
as
good
very
light
aftertaste
good
bitterness
this
is
a
great
beer
to
have
with
food
when
you
dont
want
a
big
beer
to
drown
out
the
food
flavor
you
are
pairing
it
with
a
decent
palate
cleanser
as
well
without
being
water
or
watered
down
cheers
i
was
a
huge
fan
of
spaten
hell
when
i
started
drinking
good
beer
some
34
years
ago
in
tasting
it
again
after
quite
a
long
time
i
was
expecting
a
bit
of
a
letdown
im
instead
very
glad
this
is
one
the
best
hells
out
there
o
pleasant
beer
that
goes
well
alone
or
as
an
accompaniment
to
medium
to
high
boldness
foods
the
lack
of
complexity
does
not
make
the
beer
any
less
pleasant
very
enjoyable
crisp
smooth
and
a
good
amount
of
flavor
for
such
a
simple
beer
ill
make
sure
to
get
some
more
of
these
on
some
hot
summer
days
another
german
pilsner
so
much
of
these
out
there
the
beer
is
a
hellish
gold
color
with
fluffy
white
head
on
it
the
brew
is
light
bodied
and
has
flavors
of
some
hops
malts
and
fresh
cut
grass
the
grassy
flavors
arent
too
strong
in
the
this
which
is
nice
i
can
drink
this
beer
if
i
have
too
i
wouldnt
go
out
of
my
way
to
get
it
a
tasty
oktoberfeststyle
lager
refreshing
an
easy
to
quaff
in
large
quantities
nothing
exciting
about
the
brew
but
you
can
tell
that
this
brew
is
crafted
well
for
summerfestival
consumption
overall
not
a
very
flavorful
beer
tastes
are
lacking
but
the
criteria
for
the
style
is
good
for
me
its
not
very
good
i
like
more
complexity
in
my
beers
the
liquid
is
a
pale
golden
yellow
with
a
soapy
white
head
smells
of
hay
and
skunk
with
hints
of
lemon
when
you
take
a
sip
there
is
a
slightly
bitter
lemony
hop
bite
with
other
grassy
hop
notes
and
a
base
of
bready
malt
it
is
light
with
lots
of
prickly
carbonation
and
it
has
a
dry
finish
this
is
a
good
german
lager
its
solid
all
the
way
around
very
very
drinkable
you
could
really
enjoy
a
few
pints
of
this
with
no
problems
whatsoever
okay
i
could
d
shoooot
this
is
of
the
highest
quality
i
would
put
this
up
in
there
with
the
best
of
them
if
this
were
a
pils
id
say
it
wasnt
hoppy
enough
but
its
not
for
this
style
an
excellent
beer
smooth
and
easy
drinking
this
is
a
perfect
hot
weather
cutting
the
grass
beer
clean
relatively
light
in
body
with
a
underlying
taste
of
citric
lemon
this
brew
can
be
quaffed
endlessly
without
any
challenge
slightly
offdry
in
the
mouth
and
totally
refreshing
this
brew
satisfies
without
being
over
the
top
or
over
endowed
a
great
all
around
year
long
lager
that
is
authentic
and
genuinely
germanic
and
satisfies
with
ease
d
i
am
quickly
becoming
a
huge
fan
on
munich
beer
i
suppose
since
they
have
been
doing
it
since
the
beginning
of
time
they
ought
to
know
how
to
do
it
right
my
girlfriend
notes
this
doesnt
taste
good
with
pretzels
and
i
would
agree
spaten
premium
pours
a
light
golden
color
with
a
centimeter
or
so
of
white
foam
given
the
size
and
look
of
the
foam
it
left
considerable
lacing
the
aroma
is
inviting
with
doughy
bready
notes
a
light
mouthfeel
with
some
buoyant
carbonation
grainy
malt
along
with
some
starchiness
begins
on
the
palate
as
the
beer
moves
back
the
mild
hops
balances
the
subtle
beginning
this
is
a
well
rounded
beer
a
classic
refreshing
brew
yeah
palatable
enough
once
you
get
over
that
medicinal
finish
but
nothing
special
the
label
says
malt
liquor
good
i
was
feeling
cheap
drinkability
this
is
a
well
done
thirst
quenching
beer
d
great
easy
drinking
all
around
lager
dnothing
is
wrong
with
this
beerexcept
maybe
the
green
bottle
it
just
doesnt
have
anything
special
to
differentiate
itself
from
others
in
this
style
d
i
find
that
this
is
a
very
easy
beer
to
drink
this
glass
is
nearly
finished
by
the
end
of
my
review
i
wish
it
werent
bottled
in
green
bottles
to
help
combat
some
of
that
skunk
i
would
love
to
try
this
one
on
tap
i
wish
all
beer
finished
as
clean
and
crisp
drinkability
this
is
an
ok
beer
i
am
coming
to
the
conclusion
that
german
pilsners
and
lagers
dont
do
much
for
me
they
are
not
bad
but
just
nothing
i
flip
out
over
they
are
a
good
change
for
me
on
occasion
but
i
dont
want
to
make
an
evening
out
of
this
just
not
my
preferred
style
drinkability
im
always
thrown
off
at
first
but
the
taste
grows
on
me
and
this
beer
is
quite
refreshing
i
buy
it
often
times
the
flavors
on
this
helles
are
light
subtle
and
clean
very
tasty
and
quite
drinkable
i
really
wanted
to
like
this
beer
just
like
ive
really
wanted
to
like
it
in
the
past
i
just
dont
find
it
to
very
interesting
or
tasty
i
would
drink
it
again
probably
with
the
hope
id
finally
stumble
across
that
really
good
tasting
spaten
lager
d
light
crisp
refreshing
very
drinkable
and
unlikely
to
slow
you
down
all
in
all
a
good
helles
d
the
flavours
are
pleasant
but
nothing
really
jumps
out
pretty
rounded
the
slightly
dry
finish
just
makes
you
want
to
have
another
sip
a
very
easy
drinker
and
would
be
a
very
good
session
beer
d
this
style
has
grown
on
me
and
to
me
this
is
one
of
the
better
examples
that
ive
had
lots
of
clean
flavors
with
good
balance
overall
a
delicious
german
beer
of
the
munich
helles
lager
variety
i
would
probably
take
this
over
warsteiner
or
pilsener
urquell
it
seems
to
have
more
character
while
still
being
quite
pleasing
to
many
peoples
tastes
i
found
this
beer
to
be
slightly
above
average
but
not
much
else
dont
get
me
wrong
this
eclipses
anything
for
bmc
but
it
isnt
anything
to
go
nuts
for
a
good
beer
but
not
great
i
love
helles
and
maybe
am
spoiled
by
penn
gold
but
this
wasnt
exactly
what
i
was
expecting
pours
a
nice
straw
color
with
some
lively
carbonation
and
a
nice
white
head
nose
is
aromatic
with
a
bit
of
floral
and
herbal
hops
though
mostly
light
bread
and
grain
taste
is
slightly
bitter
with
some
grain
and
straw
feel
brigs
brisk
carbonation
leading
to
some
pretty
good
drinkability
drinkability
went
well
with
a
meal
pottage
and
bread
but
i
think
this
would
be
better
with
pizza
or
a
burger
very
drinkable
d
great
session
beer
balanced
fairly
low
in
alcohol
with
no
offflavors
this
is
a
fine
beer
with
wellbalanced
pleasant
flavor
that
sits
well
on
the
palate
those
looking
for
pungency
and
strength
may
do
better
elsewhere
but
you
cant
fault
spaten
premium
for
being
a
fine
easygoing
brew
theres
a
place
for
that
i
think
bud
drinkers
and
aficionados
alike
can
find
something
here
the
difference
between
this
and
a
typical
macrobrew
is
the
subtle
additional
flavors
that
come
across
a
little
malt
a
little
lemon
some
balanced
hop
flavor
all
which
combine
to
produce
good
bavarian
beer
pours
a
light
pale
yellow
color
with
a
thin
white
head
which
gives
way
to
not
much
lacing
the
aroma
is
of
bready
malt
and
biscuits
with
hints
of
honey
and
a
touch
grassy
hops
the
taste
has
a
biscuit
and
bread
malt
backbone
with
slight
hints
of
honey
and
a
little
hop
bite
at
the
back
end
the
taste
is
crisp
and
refreshing
the
mouthfeel
is
moderately
carbonated
and
creamy
the
drinkability
is
good
it
is
crisp
refreshing
and
there
is
not
much
to
make
you
dislike
it
but
the
flavors
arent
over
the
top
drinkability
is
100
definitely
a
session
brew
if
youre
into
the
lighter
colored
ones
overall
its
not
something
that
particularly
strikes
my
fancy
but
in
and
of
itself
its
not
a
bad
brew
very
neutral
beer
has
an
odd
late
bitterness
at
the
back
that
lingers
in
what
could
if
i
were
more
cynical
could
be
described
as
an
aftertaste
but
its
not
a
swallow
flavor
its
a
late
grainyhoppy
bitterness
the
mouthfeel
is
like
waterseriously
its
wet
and
thin
and
light
easy
drinking
for
sure
the
forward
of
the
beer
is
mildly
sweet
and
middle
falls
a
little
flat
it
finishes
well
except
for
that
distracting
bitterness
its
pretty
good
and
id
have
it
again
its
a
good
lawnmower
beer
this
is
an
excellent
session
brew
for
warm
months
or
really
anytime
of
the
year
what
i
can
say
is
that
it
poured
well
with
a
foamy
head
the
aroma
is
clean
honey
sweet
and
biscuity
it
tasted
very
crisp
and
carbonated
with
a
warming
mouthfeel
the
hops
add
a
mild
bitter
flavor
certainly
a
drinkable
beer
all
in
all
a
rather
middling
brew
im
not
complaining
but
there
are
so
many
better
examples
of
the
style
decent
showing
decent
to
drink
but
refreshing
maybe
the
flavor
is
nice
for
this
style

borders
on
being

take

got
a
6

of
this
for

a

the

soon

open

and
a
beer
you
can
drink
all

long
slight
carbonation

much
better
lager
than

for

you
cant

or
maybe
not
a
few
days
i
polished
it
off
over
the
course
of
the
whole
day
while
watching
all
the
rocky
movies
but
the
newest
that
was
a
lazy
day
d
simple
and
tasty
session
brew
not
much
use
for
this
brew
but
its
not
a
bad
brew
at
all

quaffable
and
pleasant
to
drink
an
authentic
munich

lager
definitely
a
warmer

time
brew
poured
from
a
12oz
bottle
into
a
pilsner
glass
the
beer
poured
a
deep
yellow
with
no
head
or
lacing
the
aroma
is
light
consisting
of
a
light
skunkiness
a
little
hop
sweetness
and
a
hint
of
malt
the
taste
is
also
very
light
mostly
a
sweet
taste
from
the
hops
and
a
little
thickness
created
from
the
malt
not
really
a
whole
lot
in
the
taste
that
stands
out
light
mouthfeel
overall
i
could
see
having
this
beer
on
a
summer
afternoon
to
relax
but
if
flavor
was
the
issue
i
would
be
going
elsewhere
its
not
to
say
that
this
is
a
bad
beer
but
its
always
hard
to
enjoy
a
lager
such
as
this
one
for
its
flavor
its
stubborn
but
i
am
still
trying
to
get
more
into
lagers
i
will
try
this
one
again
in
a
few
months
and
see
how
my
taste
has
changed
i
am
a
very
strong
supporter
of
all
spaten
works
they
make
great
beer
and
this
is
their
way
of
a
balanced
smooth
light
beer
the
premium
evens
out
their
line
up
as
far
as
intensity
goes
holding
the
reins
of
the
optimator
safe
bet
as
youll
ever
get
the
way
to
go
for
a
great
simple
beer
that
doesnt
taste
like
a
macro
corn
brew
from
the
cheap
bud
and
coors
overall
a
very
drinkable
lager
on
draft
a
good
madison
square
garden
beer
a
simple
and
refreshing
beer
more
malty
than
hoppy
not
sure
if
this
wasnt
an
old
example
it
seemed
to
lack
a
certain
pop
in
the
flavor
despite
otherwise
being
a
clean
and
attractive
beer
pale
yellow
beer
with
thin
little
head
does
last
a
while
though
smells
more
like
todays
mexican
beers
i
know
a
lot
of
the
mexican
beers
were
started
by
german
brewers
that
traveled
to
mexico
more
than
a
german
nice
tart
kind
of
taste
kind
of
creamy
with
hints
of
corn
mouthfeel
is
smooth
and
easy
going
down

is
fair
crisp
refreshing
this
beer
came
out
a
nice
golden
yellow
thats
was
crystal
clear
and
covered
with
a
nice
thick
head
that
slowly
tapered
away
into
a
thin
head
simply
put
this
beer
looks
really
inviting
i
can
barely
smell
the
hops
in
this
one
but
it
does
have
a
semi
sweet
aroma
it
looks
and
smells
better
than
it
tastes
dont
get
me
wrong
its
not
a
bad
beer
but
it
could
use
some
work
when
it
first
hits
your
tongue
it
feels
slightly
dull
and
a
little
dry
and
its
aftertaste
has
a
bit
of
a
dry
kick
to
it
as
well
i
can
really
taste
the
bitterness
of
this
beer
as
it
hits
my
throat
has
a
nice
dark
golden
yellow
color
pours
with
a
nice
thick
head
with
tinny
bubbles
that
lace
the
litre
glass
as
they
recede

aroma

vienna
malt

i
would

what
a
lager
should
be
i
could
drink
an
awfully
lot
of
this
beer
again
this
is
not
a
beer
that
will
smack
you
and
tell
you
how
great
it
is
in
fact
it
is
not
great
but
on
a
sunday
afternoon
watching
the
eagles
lay
waste
to
a
really
lame
redskins
squad
it
went
quite
nicely
with
the
wursts
and
salads
so
while
it
is
more
or
less
pedestrian
its
also
very
drinkable
flowing
like
the
proverbial
water
though
with
a
more
fun
result
i
wont
seek
it
out
but
short
of
other
options
i
wouldnt
say
no
if
it
was
offered
i
suppose
this
is
a
decent
session
beer
and
good
for
a
european
macro
this
would
probably
not
be
my
1st
choice
of
imports
but
i
do
like
it
better
than
some
massmarketed
european
macros
and
sure
beats
the
hell
out
of
the
majority
of
american
massmarketed
beer
the
taste
was
somewhat
heavier
than
expected
with
a
flowing
sweet
quality
to
it
that
marked
the
50
liter
barrel
for
certain
emptiness
by
the
end
of
the
night
as
it
was
one
4
barrels
i
got
back
to
it
when
it
was
half
way
done
for
a
half
cup
which
confirmed
how
refreshing
it
was
d
a
very
drinkable
beer
could
go
through
quite
a
few
of
these
im
really
starting
to
appreciate
the
bottom
fermented
beverages
of
the
world
alot
more
d
went
down
reasonbly
smooth
it
really
wasnt
something
i
could
have
more
than
two
of
but
if
you
do
like
strong
smelling
malted
lagers
the
smell

it
while
having

the

more
like
a
pils
but
it
does
not

like
it
the
foam
is
white
and
thick
good
taste
great
beer
among
those
that
are
shipped
to

look

to
another
one
eric
d
crisp
and
refreshing
malty
but
not
overly
sweet
easy
to
drink
on
the
whole
i
was
disappointed
by
this
beer
its
a
cut
above
american
macro
lagers
but
has
none
of
the
complexity
and
depth
that
characterize
spatens
other
offerings
very
drinkable
i
will
find
this
one
again
drinkability
a
nice
refreshing
easy
drinking
beer
good
on
one
of
the
last
days
of
summer
with
temps
in
the
mid
80s
after
i
finished
mowing
the
lawn
d
quite
drinkable
better
than
most
lagers
spaten
premium
was
golden
in
color
and
very
clear
it
had
a
fairly
large
white
head
with
good
retention
and
some
lacing
it
had
a
light
malt
aroma
the
taste
was
slightly
sweet
at
first
but
is
followed
by
the
hops
to
balance
out
nicely
leaving
a
slight
hop
aftertaste
this
beer
is
medium
bodied
and
tasty
it
would
be
very
easy
to
drink
several
in
a
sitting
this
is
a
nice
beer
to
have
when
you
just
want
to
relax
not
at
all
demanding
on
the
taste
buds
just
very
crisp
and
smooth
a
well
balanced
beer
i
am
impressed
spaten
premium
lager
pours
a
light
golden
color
with
a
white
head
from
a
green
twelve
ounce
bottle
the
aroma
is
very
mild
and
has
just
the
slightest
amount
of
skunk
taste
is
surprisingly
good
a
really
well
done
lager
balanced
to
a
tee
very
highly
drinkable
would
make
an
excellent
session
beer
this
beer
poured
a
nice
yellowishgold
in
color
and
had
a
good
1
head
that
was
retained
relatively
well
the
aroma
was
of
malt
and
hops
the
taste
was
very
light
dry
and
crisp
and
extremely
smooth
i
detected
some
hops
but
not
an
overwhelming
amount
the
mouthfeel
was
thin
but
not
in
a
bad
way
and
had
a
good
amount
of
carbonation
this
beer
was
extremely
easy
to
drink
and
very
refreshing
had
this
one
at
a
golf
club
in
the
bar
i
wasnt
expecting
much
selection
but
they
did
have
this
one
on
tap
wow
was
i
surprised
at
how
much
i
enjoyed
it
looks
very
ordinary
pale
golden
lager
with
a
slight
white
head
the
taste
was
exceptional
slighly
sweet
grainy
malt
nicely
balanced
with
hops
very
drinkable
i
could
have
stayed
all
night
this
is
a
good
one
for
a
session
poured
on
tap
from
one
of
portlands
great
places
to
find
german

served

well

typical

scents
on

full
rounded

and
superb
balance
between

and
a
malty
sweetness
a
great
munich
helles
man
this
beer
man
this
beer
it
is
so
freakin
tastey
a
brainless
drink
but
man
does
it
ever
taste
good
d
if
i
had
to
have
only
one
beer
for
the
rest
of
my
life
i
could
settle
on
this
overall
this
is
a
very
drinkable
beer
through
and
through
this
is
the
first
legitamate
german
beer
that
i
have
tired
and
it
is
exactly
what
i
expected
and
then
some
very
pleased
this
is
certainly
the
best
munich
helles
lager
that
ive
had
and
ive
tried
a
fair
number
better
than
the
other
in
every
respect
looks
better
smell
and
taste
is
more
balanced
andor
refined
easy
and
nice
to
drink
for
practically
any
occasion
this
will
definitely
be
on
my
next
shopping
list
a
pilsener
through
and
through
i
bought
this
thinking
it
was
a
helles
which
is
what
i
was
in
the
mood
for
still
quite
good
prosit
mk
this
is
one
of
the
finest
beirs
on
the
planet
a
monumental
achivement
excellent
taste
nice
smell
very
good
appearance
and
drinkability
good
balance
among
malt
yeast
and
hops
it
worth
a
try
for
sure
drank
very
easy
super
impressed
that
this
stood
up
so
well
from
its
swim
across
the
pond
brings
bak
memories
of
a
gasthaus
we
frequented
in
garmisch
spaten
joint
that
was
walking
distance
from
the
campground
had
stellar
food
great
summer
time
session
bier
a
great
quaffable
pilsener
very
drinkable
d
wow
very
unimpressed
with
this
offering
from
what
i
consider
to
be
a
great
brewery
love
optimator
and
love
their
oktoberfest
but
this
traditional
lager
leaves
a
lot
to
be
desired
particularly
the
presence
of
any
hops
not
sure
if
this
beer
is
trying
to
be
more
of
a
pils
or
helles
but
either
way
pass
this
by
not
a
terrible
beer
and
i
can
see
trying
it
on
tap
particularly
if
i
can
back
to
munich
anytime
soon
but
in
the
bottle
its
mostly
weak
and
uninspiring
all
in
all
a
pretty
good
lager
so
yes
i
could
see
getting
this
again
and
having
it
with
pizza
the
better
choice
to
bmc
and
wont
scare
off
nonbas
opinion
i
am
disappointed
in
the
green
bottle
that
these
beers
come
in
this
is
a
pretty
tasty
beer
and
one
that
i
am
sure
is
better
in
germany
vom
fass
it
has
a
meaty
enough
presence
that
it
holds
it
own
as
a
topnotch
beer
but
it
isnt
in
the
best
of
shape
by
the
time
it
makes
it
over
the
big
water
i
would
like
to
try
this
beer
fresh
and
on
tap
drinkability
very
drinkable
especially
on
a
hot
day
not
my
first
pick
to
buy
but
i
wont
turn
one
down
when
offered
i
have
been
to
germany
many
times
and
drank
alot
of
beer
even
made
the
octoberfest
once
i
wish
i
had
written
down
each
beer
i
drank
if
i
could
have
held
a
pen
bottle
pours
a
pale
golden
color
with
a
finger
width
white
cap
the
cap
dissipated
with
a
thin
lacings
on
surface
and
on
sides
there
is
a
constant
uprising
shower
of
tiny
bubbles
even
from
my
basic
pilsner
glass
smell
is
citrus
hops
and
cereal
maltiness
just
like
the
style
should
taste
is
basic
german
pils
but
not
quite
as
bold
as
i
would
like
flavors
do
blend
well
just
light
a
little
on
the
watery
side
with
medium
level
of
carbonation
this
is
very
smooth
going
down
and
refreshing
as
i
usually
say
about
this
style
great
burger
and
hot
day
brew
finishes
of
clean
and
very
thirst
quenching
put
some
brats
and
burgers
on
the
grill
this
brew
makes
me
think
of
summer
mouthfeel
is
nice
and
clean
like
a
light
beer
should
be
it
has
a
nice
clean
balanced
flavor
that
isnt
biased
its
usually
a
little
light
for
my
taste
but
is
just
right
when
im
in
the
mood
for
something
that
wont
fill
me
up
man
was
i
disappointed
when
i
got
this
from
beer
poker
2
50
for
whatever
bottle
they
pull
out
at
the
flying
saucer
my
buddy
got
rogue
dead
guy
and
another
60
minute
ipa
nobody
would
trade
me
it
could
have
been
disappointment
in
poker
but
my
general
impression
was
this
one
was
not
impressive
a
dinkle
acker
of
prima
pils
is
more
my
style
this
ones
a
bit
bitter
more
of
a
euro
lager
in
appeance
and
smell
easy
enough
to
drink
but
i
wont
pick
this
one
again
but
will
probably
play
beer
poker
again
heres
a
clear
pale
golden
colored
liquid
with
twofingers
of
brilliantly
white
soapy
foam
lots
of
carbonation
just
look
at
the
endless
upward
march
of
bubbles
nice
lace
attractive
beer
theres
sweet
malt
in
the
nose
along
with
some
vegetal
characteristics
and
a
grassy
herbal
hop
smell
its
not
a
powerful
aroma
but
it
is
pleasing
and
much
more
appealing
than
most
euromacro
lagers
the
taste
is
composed
of
a
nice
malt
flavor
pilsner
thats
well
balanced
the
high
carbonation
gives
the
beer
a
spritzy
quality
that
i
could
have
done
without
the
finish
has
a
mild
shot
of
hop
bitterness
along
with
a
lingering
semisweetness
mediumlight
body
this
is
certainly
a
lot
better
than
some
of
its
direct
competitors
easy
to
drink
and
enjoyable
in
my
opinion
spaten
lager
is
a
refreshing
light
lager
which
definitely
leans
more
to
german
pils
although
spaten
also
makes
a
pils
than
to
műnchner
helles
it
is
quite
drinkable
and
definitely
sessionable
a
great
beer
for
a
mass
krug
in
the
biergarten
on
a
nice
summer
afternoon
overall
easy
drinking
it
has
been
a
couple
years
since
ive
touched
a
spaten
im
glad
ive
revisited
it
d
very
drinkable
would
recommend
poured
a
perfectly
clear
strawyellow
into
a
pilsener
glass
white
foamy
one
and
a
half
finger
head
fell
to
light
lacing
pretty
quickly
smells
crisp
sweet
definite
balanced
hop
and
malt
aroma
present
as
well
tastes
as
crisp
and
clean
as
it
smells
very
refreshing
beer
hints
of
citrus
then
the
hops
come
in
finishes
with
the
balanced
malt
no
bitterness
or
alcohol
bite
present
whatsoever
a
definite
session
beer
goes
down
nice
and
smooth
despite
moderate
carbonation
on
the
tongue
but
the
crisp
finish
is
absolutely
remarkable
would
purchase
again
a
fine
example
of
a
german
pilsener
from
a
fine
german
brewer
mouthfeel
was
rather
nice
however
while
somewhat
thin
it
was
very
smooth
and
mellow
a
definite
easy
session
drink
but
overall
an
average
beer
i
have
a
hard
time
picking
out
distinct
flavors
in
lagers
but
this
one
is
pretty
good
and
its
definitely
easy
to
drink
i
just
dont
find
myself
as
satisfied
drinking
this
lager
as
a
lot
of
spatens
other
brews
which
i
think
are
some
of
the
best
from
germany
fizzy
carbonation
and
a
totally
clean
finish
it
goes
well
with
any
food
which
is
a
plus
and
you
can
drink
it
year
round
it
will
take
the
chill
away
in
the
winter
and
cool
you
down
in
the
summer
try
it
and
you
will
be
hooked
pale
yellow
color
with
nice
volume
of
dense
white
head
smells
of
light
grains
with
a
bit
of
hoppy
spice
taste
shows
a
similar
blend
of
lightly
sweet
malts
touched
with
a
bit
of
crispness
the
mouthfeel
seems
a
little
offby
no
means
unpleasant
but
somewhat
illdefined
still
this
beer
goes
down
easily
and
is
a
good
example
of
a
style
that
in
general
i
find
uninspiring
overall
this
is
a
fine
lager
and
good
for
when
youre
looking
for
something
good
to
drink
on
a
hot
day
or
when
you
dont
want
a
really
heavy
hitter
a
boring
german
pilsner
but
then
i
find
the
style
boring
in
general
so
i
guess
i
should
try
to
compare
this
to
other
pilsners
ive
had
a
pretty
average
and
followtheguidelines
style
beer
right
down
to
the
smallest
detail
obviously
its
better
than
most
american
pilsners
and
mostly
the
same
as
other
european
pilsners
whew
there
is
just
not
much
to
say
one
way
or
the
other
about
this
one
i
am
quite
surprised
with
this
beer
i
didnt
really
expect
much
and
it
turned
out
to
be
something
worth
drinking
it
is
a
good
beer
if
you
cant
decide
what
to
drink
because
it
hits
the
spot
without
any
extreme
stuff
going
on
a
person
used
to
cheap
beer
may
even
like
this
because
it
isnt
overly
flavorful
but
does
have
more
than
the
junk
beers
i
recommend
that
both
seasoned
beer
drinkers
and
those
stuck
on
american
lite
beers
try
it
pours
a
pale
straw
crystal
clear
bubbly
two
finger
head
with
good
retention
and
decent
lacing
the
floral
hop
aroma
is
strong
with
background
sweet
malt
the
pale
munich
type
flavor
upfront
is
faint
but
balanced
well
with
bold
noble
hops
spicy
whole
hop
aftertaste
that
comes
on
strong
then
gracefully
fades
light
body
and
actively
carbonated
for
a
smooth
mouthfeel
with
a
very
mild
hoppy
finish
a
quality
pilsener
with
no
skunk
character
and
high
drinkability
i
found
it
amusing
that
the
label
indicates
this
is
malt
liquor
it
also
tries
to
make
up
for
its
mediocrity
by
playing
the
reinheitsgebot
card
overall
a
very
good
lager
very
drinkable
recommended
drinkability
pretty
drinkable
spaten
premium
lager
is
good
solid
beer
if
there
was
any
justice
in
the
world
this
kind
of
balanced
shouldappealtoall
flavor
profile
would
be
embraced
by
bmc
as
the
blueprint
for
their
standard
lagers
maybe
then
i
could
get
some
degree
of
enjoyment
out
of
those
occasions
when
im
forced
to
drink
their
products
pours
a
clear
golden
color
with
a
nice
white
head
on
tap
into
16oz
pint
glass
grassy
aromas
and
hops
are
present
taste
has
a
lot
of
grain
present
nice
crisp
hops
and
a
slightly
sweet
finish
pleasant
lively
carbonation
abounds
a
very
crisp
and
refreshing
beer
highly
drinkable
a
good
session
beer
or
refresher
on
a
hot
day
this
is
my
standard
reference
beer
by
which
i
measure
all
the
others
not
one
thing
about
this
beer
is
outstanding
but
nothing
is
flawed
either
very
drinkable
and
dependable
beer
choice
that
isnt
that
hard
to
find
i
was
surprised
that
i
had
not
reviewed
this
beer
yet
when
i
noticed
the
omission
definitly
would
not
turn
away
and
are
drinkable
just
nothing
groundbreaking
here
in
this
german
lager
other
great
spaten
brews
available
however
reading
the
description
of
the
style
i
think
it
fits
very
very
well
its
spicy
often
times
a
bit
coarse
on
the
palate
definitly
herbal
and
citrus
like
so
i
give
some
point
to
that
not
my
favorite
style
though
pours
golden
clear
with
a
fine
thick
whitish
head
that
fades
slowly
citrus
grapefruit
and
grassy
nose
taste
is
bitter
hoppy
watery
and
yet
somewhat
plain
still
theres
something
there
and
a
good
bitter
finish
mouth
is
more
watery
than
id
like
but
its
pretty
drinkable
overall
a
good
pilsner
though
not
as
good
as
some
other
spaten
offerings
its
just
an
average
lager
and
i
can
find
some
domestic
beers
that
are
quite
better
than
this
one
a
terrific
thirst
quencher
looks
a
solid
straw
in
color
and
crystal
clear
forms
a
fairly
dense
head
that
lingers
at
about
14
smells
lightly
malty
vegetal
herbal
and
hoppy
tastes
lightly
sweet
on
the
side
of
light
honey
or
powdered
sugar
hop
balance
is
present
in
the
flavor
and
bitterness
this
brings
out
an
herbal
character
through
the
body
light
apple
flavors
rise
and
remain
through
the
finish
the
body
is
medium
and
carbonated
coats
the
mouth
nicely
without
being
buttery
finishes
crisply
and
suddenly
without
drying
only
mild
hop
flavors
persist
in
the
aftertaste
a
very
drinkable
and
thirst
drenching
brew
appearance
is
translucent
gold
a
white
head
that
leaves
some
lace
aroma
is
of
grasses
and
herbs
barley
and
malt
there
is
promise
here
that
is
not
fulfilled

roasted

fescue
along
with
pungent
bitter
hops
may
be
to
the
taste
of
some
but
i
will
pass
nice
bronze
colored
pour
with
a
foamy
white
head
thats
quite
large
and
holds
up
well
moderate
lacing
but
not
too
much
aroma
begins
really
grassy
but
not
really
herbal
some
sweet
honey
notes
come
into
the
picture
as
well
taste
has
a
remarkable
balance
between
the
sweet
grainy
flavors
and
the
grassy
hoppy
bitterness
but
with
that
being
said
the
flavors
arent
really
anything
too
great
soft
almost
weak
begins
more
grassy
and
grows
sweeter
the
further
i
go
finish
is
a
sweetness
more
than
a
dryness
which
is
odd
to
me
for
this
style
decent
beer
solid
rounded
mouthfeel
well
crafted
but
nothing
amazing
imo
the
bubbles
are
very
lively
in
this
pilsners
pale
to
gold
body
the
good
sized
white
head
sticks
around
to
the
last
sip
it
smells
nice
with
cut
grass
and
hop
aromas
it
has
enough
of
that
saaz
bite
to
satisfy
me
this
beer
isnt
particularly
complex
however
it
is
very
refreshing
and
very
easy
to
drink
i
picked
this
stuff
up
for
a
party
at
which
no
one
drank
and
im
happy
to
be
stuck
with
it
overall
im
giving
this
a
3
for
drinkability
i
like
it
just
fine
for
what
it
is
but
i
find
it
not
really
worthy
of
the
price
i
paid
for
it
and
i
probably
wont
purchase
it
again
anytime
soon
if
i
find
it
ontap
ill
probably
give
it
another
try
however
drinkabilty
i
like
it
but
im
unfamiliar
with
the
style
not
bad
but
i
would
not
seek
another
at
this
time
need
to
try
more
than
revisit
this
one
certainly
one
of
the
least
offensive
beers
one
could
try
but
simple
in
scope
and
complexity
not
a
bad
brew
to
offers
noobies
before
moving
them
on
to
stouts
this
one
would
certainly
hit
the
spot
after
a
heavy
day
of
labor
in
the
sun
bright
clear
golden
yellow
body
with
a
large
thick
offwhite
head
smells
of
clean
honeyish
malt
with
a
pungeant

honey
biscuit

up

sweetened
snappy

bitterness

finishes
clean
with

light
bitterness
not
bad
light
to
medium
bodied
with
a
refreshing
feel
very
light
color
and
a
decent
pure
white
head
the
lesseducated
folks
at
my
table
assumed
that
i
was
drinking
some
sort
of
domestic
megaswill
they
were
fortunately
wrong
a
noseful
of
hops
with
some
malt
good
taste
with
a
hit
of
hops
early
and
nice
amount
of
sweetness
nice
light
and
crisp
with
ample
carbonation
a
bit
astringent
but
it
comes
with
the
territory
im
not
a
huge
hops
fan
so
the
drinkability
is
hurt
a
bit
by
having
to
work
through
the
initial
taste
still
a
quality
brew
and
a
proper
representative
of
this
genre
this
beer
pours
a
nice
golden
color
with
a
brilliant
pure
bright
white
head
it
appears
to
be
very
bubbly
and
highly
carbonated
it
smells
of
smellls
of
hops
and
seems
kind
of
grainy
the
taste
is
impressive
the
bitter
hops
are
pronounced
well
at
first
yet
not
too
overwhelming
at
all
tastes
great
the
mouthfeel
is
great
as
well
it
doesnt
quite
seem
to
have
that
lightbodied
feel
to
it
that
i
expected
above
average
pilsener
by
my
standards
final
thought
germany
has
the
most
drinkable
mainstream
beers
with
spaten
and
warsteiner
leading
and
krombacher
and
konigpilsener
while
in
germany
itself
this
is
one
of
those
beers
that
i
could
and
have
drink
an
insane
amount
of
i
have
more
than
once
after
all
knocked
out
one
of
those
5
litre
minikegs
of
this
stuff
by
myself
in
2
hours
or
so
this
stuff
pours
a
golden
straw
colour
with
a
white
foamy
head
that
subsides
after
a
few
minutes
the
nose
is
quite
mild
with
pleasantly
noticeable
amounts
of
both
hops
and
malt
though
malt
does
seem
to
dominate
the
taste
of
the
beer
is
quite
malty
with
a
pleasantly
bitter
hops
kick
on
the
finish
lack
of
huge
carbonation
makes
this
easy
to
drink
and
have
a
smooth
mouthfeel
theres
a
ton
of
becks
fans
out
there
but
in
my
opinion
in
the
way
of
german
lagers
spaten
is
könig
despite
the
fact
that
i
am
not
a
big
lager
fan
i
enjoyed
this
one
and
will
most
likely
purchase
it
again
balance
is
the
key
to
a
brilliant
pilsener
and
spatens
premium
lager
has
it
beyond
its
typically
crystalclear
golden
body
and
brightwhite
head
lies
a
perfectly
balanced
combination
of
grassy
and
mildly
spicy
hops
amidst
a
grainy
and
mildly
sweet
malt
its
nose
is
bright
and
welcoming
with
the
hops
and
malt
taking
turns
in
appearance
but
also
working
together
to
deliver
a
more
concise
presentation
the
flavor
follows
along
the
same
lines
and
its
rich
and
exciting
without
being
overly
bold
its
malt
is
nicely
grainy
and
softly
sweet
with
suggestions
of
munich
malts
and
it
acts
as
the
perfect
supple
blanket
on
which
to
lay
its
grassy
and
spicy
hop
flavors
its
components
are
distinct
but
always
kept
in
check
even
its
bitterness
is
solid
and
clearly
present
but
not
aggressively
bold
this
is
a
southern
german
pilsner
thats
balanced
with
a
gentle
hand
and
formulated
for
drinkability
and
it
succeeds

low
for

nice
aroma
though
i
was
given
this
beer
by
mistake
and
got
to
try
it
for
free
i
found
it
rather
ordinary
for
a
german
lager
it
poured
a
pale
yellow
with
a
small
white
head
that
disappeared
way
too
quickly
the
aroma
was
pleasantly
grassy
with
some
hints
of
the
malt
the
taste
is
bland
with
nothing
really
presenting
itself
strongly
there
was
a
mediocre
malt
base
with
a
very
slight
hop
finish
it
was
thin
but
cleansing
in
the
mouth
i
found
that
it
went
down
quickly
but
not
nearly
as
satisfying
as
the
franziskaner
that
i
ordered
sampled
from
a
refrigerator
sized
minikeg
i
think
it
was
about
5l
in
size
instructions
are
clearly
marked
but
freshness

beer
i
had
this
beer
out
of
a
1gallon
keg
it
poured
golden
but
with
little
head
i
think
this
had
to
do
with
the
way
the
tap
worked
and
i
was
doing
this
at
an
akward
angle
the
aroma
was
sweet
floral
hops
the
taste
was
where
it
was
at
though
when
this
sweet
lager
hit
my
taste
buds
i
was
in
heaven
this
beer
was
sweet
but
not
soda
sweet
it
was
just
the
right
thickness
and
coated

mouth
well
drinkability
is
high
this
is
a
beer
i
could
drink
a

its
a
very
well
balanced
lager
that
goes
down
quite
smoothly
and
deserves
multiple
offerings
it
does
have
a
strong
malt
flavor
which
isnt
for
everyone
but
i
was
pleasantly
surprised
a
fairly
good
lager
not
anything
special
but
has
good
level
of
drinkability
drinkability

this

a

combines
with

and
enhances
the
overall
experience
on

in
my
exploits
of
sampling
loads
of
beer
sometimes
its
nice
to
revert
back
to
a
beer
that
it
reminiscent
of
what
i
drank
in
my
teenage
years
though
this
is
way
better
than
some
of
the
swill
i
drank
back
then
very
drinkable
excellent
for
the

i
could

in
this
one
there
is
just
enough

pushing
through
to
give

very

and

balanced
beer
this
beer
came
to
me
as
quite
a
surprise
as
it
might
to
anyone
who
expected
a
typical
somewhat
bland
lager
unique
and
very
refreshing
a
great
summer
beer
drinkability
very
very
drinkable
too
drinkable
goes
down
like
carbonated
water
but
is
this
a
good
thing
the
only
thing
holding
back
its
drinkability
is
that
that
taste
becomes
boring
fast
and
starts
to
build
up
its
boringness
this
is
a
fairly
good
representation
of
the
style
which
almost
tends
to
be
unexceptional
by
definition
nevertheless
theres
some
elegance
about
it
any
misstep
in
production
or
design
would
be
immediately
noticeable
and
a
nice
seamless
quality
it
has
a
pleasantly
restrained
nose

good
session
brew
had
a
minikeg
of
this
at
a
little
party
tonight
it
poured
a
medium
gold
color
with
a
very
nice
white
head
that
settled
after
about
5
minutes
and
left
nice
lace
down
my
glass
the
smell
was
quite
malty
with
a
very
bread
like
scent
overall
the
taste
was
very
smoothe
and
was
largley
dominated
by
a
thick
maltiness
slight
grain
and
apple
flavors
were
there
as
well
and
pretty
much
no
hoppiness
to
it
whatsoever
the
mouthfeel
was
quite
flat
im
thinking
the
mini
keg
might
have
gone
flat
or
it
was
not
tapped
right
or
something
all
in
all
it
was
a
good
easy
drinking
beer
that
went
very
well
with
the
pizza
and
bean
dip
i
hadnt
had
this
beer
in
a
while
as
i
usually
leery
of
green
bottles
but
biermanva
left
a
couple
over
at
my
casa
after
a
cook
out
and
well
im
not
gonna
let
it
go
to
waste
pours
a
nice
clear
golden
hue
with
a
fluffy
almost
pure
white
head
smell
was
crisp
with
the
typical
german
lager
hoppiness
with
a
bit
of
the
sweetness
of
the
malt
coming
through
as
well
taste
was
clean
and
crisp
a
bit
of
slightly
sweet
maltiness
at
first
which
was
washed
away
by
the
nice
crisp
drying
noble
hops
a
bit
prickly
on
the
tongue
with
the
carbonation
but
still
nice
very
drinkable
i
can
see
being
able
to
suck
these
down
with
abandon
on
a
hot
summer
day
i
would
certainly
pick
up
a
few
of
them
this
summer
especially
in
the
5
liter
keg
which
cant
get
light
struck
i
did
like
this
beer
even
if
it
was
a
bit
neutral
and
unexciting
having
a
fresh
sample
probably
did
wonders
for
this
beer
this
beer
can
be
used
to
wash
down
some
wursts
and
spaetzle
with
no
problem
as
an
average
everyday
beer

might
be
a
slightly
better

flavor
of
the
best
lagers
this
would
always
do

i
rarely
buy
it
because
there
are
better

this
is
in
my
opinion
a
brew
that
is
criminally
underrated
true
to
the
style
refreshing
and
tasty
too
this
is
a
wellrounded
brew
that
unfortunately
lacks
the

character
that
we

seem
to
crave
in

ill
admit
that
the

do
little

me

is
warm

some
serious

to
round
it
out
some
hops
lurk
in

background

largely
serve
to
make
the

is

i
could
see
this
being
a
topnotch
session
beer
very
clean
and
crisp
in
the
mouthfeel
and
an
extremely
clean
finish
as
the
bitterness
fell
off
the
tongue
immediately
carbonation
levels
were
just
right
extremely
drinkable
as
a
lighter
bodied
beer
but
one
could
get
bored
of
this
over
time
if
what
you
want
is
a
simple
thirst
quencher
clearly
made
from
quality
ingredients
or
just
a
nice
beer
to
keep
around
for
guests
accustomed
to
macro
lager
this
is
certainly
worth
considering
i
think
ill
pour
another
one
now
probably
a
classic
but
just
not
a
lot
going
on
here
for
the
long
haul

to
be
drunk

am

drink
one
this
is
it
in
this
new
land
of
extreme
and
huge
beers
this
beer
is
a
perfect
example
of
what
can
be
accomplished
in
a
simple
beer
pale
straw
color
active
carbonation
and
a
creamy
white
head
not
much
boquet
although
you
can
smell
a
little
bread
and
grass
tastes
light
and
malty
with
not
much
hops
backing
a
semidry
finish
makes
this
an
aboveaverage
beer
not
that
great
compared
to
optimator
though
drinkablility
the
standard
bearer
for
yellow
beers
the
head
was
as
white
as
a
models
teeth
dissapeared
quickly
back
into
the
clear
golden
liquid
where
it
originated
sweet
malt
and
skunky
hops
make
up
the
faint
aroma
theres
more
carbonation
than
flavor
in
this
beer
it
tastes
the
same
as
it
smells
not
a
bad
beer
just
not
a
whole
to
it
notes
a
tad
grainy
for
my
tastes
paid

for

6er
drinkability
if
this
dms
doesnt
bother
you
then
its
rather
drinkable
id
probably
drink
it
if
someone
bought
it
for
me
but
thats
about
it
came
out
clear
gold
under
a
big
slightly
offwhite
contoured
head
that
left
excellent
lace
down
the
glass
the
nose
is
mildly
malty
with
unfortunately
a
touch
of
soap
the
mouth
is
prickly
and
light
as
it
should
be
the
flavor
features
a
good
light
malt
followed
by
a
nice
hoppy
bite
in
the
finish
the
aftertaste
combines
the
light
malty
sweetness
with
a
hoppy
bitterness
making
you
long
for
the
next
sip
good
stuff
pours
out
to
a
bright
golden
in
the
glass
with
a
slight
very
white
head
aroma
is
that
of
a
light
lemon
and
grass
the
taste
is
very
eurolager
and
is
quite
good
this
could
be
an
easy
session
beer
to
sit
back
with
during
a
sporting
event
on
the
tube
i
liked
this
beer
i
gave
it
an
average
on
appearance
because
i
drank
it
straight
from
the
bottle
this
night
i
have
had
it
before
in
a
pub
but
cannot
remember
it
or
much
else
from
that
night
it
has
a
slightly
wheatymalt
aroma
with
good
rich
hops
the
taste
was
very
crisp
and
refreshing
and
mellows
excellently
as
it
warms
up
it
has
a
sweet
and
malty
taste
and
feels
great
going
down
the
throat
i
found
it
very
drinkable
it
was
easy
to
drink
even
at
the
end
of
a
night
of
moderate
partying
after
the
oktoberfest
and
the
optimator
i
was
disappointed
light
gold
color
small
white
foamy
head
aroma
is
grainy
and
sweet
a
light
bodied
lager
slightly
hoppy
and
mildly
malty
nice
flavor
somewhat
fruity
mouthfeel
is
full
and
round
finish
is
clean
aftertaste
is
slightly
bitter
light
and
refreshing
being
a
big
optimator
fan
i
thought
this
would
be
a
nice
surprise
well
it
was
it
was
less
than
great
the
color
aroma
and
head
all
seemed
to
fit
into
the
lager
arena
but
the
taste
left
me
wondering
if
they
mistakenly
bottled
their
weisse
beer
in
the
lager
bottles
i
mean
the
flavors
of
wet
grain
and
grass
were
there
and
it
just
took
me
by
surprise
not
much
in
the
way
of
hops
and
the
malt
is
present
in
small
doses
ah
well
one
of
these
is
still
infinitely
better
than
a
case
of
anything
made
by
ab
very
easy
going
down
and
could
make
a
good
session
brew
not
a
lager
fan
but
this
one
seems
right
on
for
flavor
and
drinkability
served
in
a
half
liter
malles
munich
mug
and
had
a
bright
golden
color
it
started
out
a
little
grainy
but
the
hops
were
evident
towards
the
end
the
mouthfeel
was
smooth
for
this
lightbodied
beer
and
it
went
down
pretty
easy
smoothness
leads
to
a
great
drinkability
for
this
beer
john
on
the
palate
it
is
decidedly
firm
with
a
solid
cold
grip
of
baked
grain
and
mineral
easy
malty
sweetness
reigns
over
the
soft
bubbly
mousse
the
only
structural
check
offered
as
there
is
no
acidity
or
burnt
bitterness
to
speak
of
perhaps
a
little
top
heavy
or
soapy
but
a
lovely
little
lager
nonetheless
poured
medium
head
with
finesmall
bubbles
that
quickly
dissolved
there
was
not
much
lacing
with
this
brew
there
was
carbonation
observed
rising
to
the
top
it
had
a
fruity
citrusy
aroma
to
it
it
was
a
thin
and
watery
brew
the
body
was
a
light
yellow
this
brew
reminded
me
too
much
of
american
massproduced
beers
this
was
disappointing
notes
one
of
the
originals
and
some
what
underrated
in
my
opinion
this
brew
has
no
problem
pairing
with
a
plate
of
knock
and
bratwurst
with
a
tangy
kraut
and
some
german
potato
salad
my
green
bottle
wasnt
skunked
but
i
think
there
are
tastier
versions
of
this
out
there
slightly
drier
hoppier
and
with
a
bit
more
bite
in
the
taste
pat
this
is
one
of
the
classic
world
beers
a
helles
is
the
highest
measure
of
bavarian
brewing
skills
subtle
and
nuanced
any
flaws
are
readily
apparent
i
would
love
to
drink
this
fresh
in
munich
this
brew
pours
a
medium
head
of
fine
to
medium
sized
white
bubbles
and
a
transparent
straw
yellow
lager
colored
body
it
has
a
hoppy
aroma
with
a
fizzy
initial
burp
taste
and
a
hoppy
slightly
bitter
acidic
flavor
that
lingers
well
after
it
finishes
it
left
only
a
fair
lacing
i
expect
better
from
spaten
the
maker
of
one
of
my
favorite
doppelbocks
but
a
s
a
lager
if
you
like
them
this
one
is
just
ok
i
originally
had
spaten
a
few
months
ago
at
a
local
beer
bar
the
other
night
while
browsing
a
6pack
place
i
noticed
for
the
first
time
the
dignified
yet
cool
symbol
of
the
shovel
on
the
sixer
of
spaten
i
was
sold
it
poured
a
clear
bright
gold
color
with
just
a
bit
of
lacing
and
noticeable
carbonation
there
was
a
nice
sharp
hop
smell
with
a
lingering
malt
foundation
i
also
noticed
a
grassy
almost
fruity
odor
and
thankfully
no
skunk
the
taste
was
very
crisp
and
mildly
sweet
but
the
nice
hop
addition
adds
some
nice
citrus
characteristics
after
the
swallow
the
mouthfeel
was
pretty
average
and
lighter
than
expected
easy
drinking
with
a
pleasing
smell
and
taste
spaten
is
a
very
reliable
and
honest
import
this
sixer
went
down
very
quickly
it
had
to
be
the
shovel
my
friend
decided
he
did
not
want
this
bottle
because
it
said
malt
liquor
on
the
front
and
i
was
more
than
happy
to
relieve
him
of
itwink
wink
bah
another
green
bottle
oh
well
it
poured
a
light
pale
yellow
without
too
much
head
and
not
very
much
carbonation
apparent
the
smell
had
contrasting
sesations
first
there
was
a
shaphallertau
hop
aromoa
which
cut
through
the
more
malty
honeyflowery
smell
the
taste
was
sweet
and
thin
up
front
buttery
and
full
bodied
malts
dominated
the
middle
which
receded
back
to
the
sweet
taste
and
finished
with
a
hoppylittle
bit
skunky
bitter
aftertaste
vey
decent
beer
pours
a
clear
golden
color
with
a
thin
yet
lasting
head
a
smell
that
is
somewhat
skunky
with
some
malts
to
be
noted
the
initial
onslaught
of
rich
and
grainy
hops
are
noted
followed
with
a
creamy
and
grassy
tasted
the
clear
green
bottle
leaves
a
bad
impression
on
an
average
beer
not
much
to
write
home
about
drank
this
one
in
venice
italy
im
wondering
if
this
is
the
same
beer
as
the
munchner
hell
renamed
for
the
export
market
clear

a
wellmade
delicate
and
pleasant
brew
an
easydrinking
eurolager
that
doesnt
challenge
but
is
slightly
above
average
for
the
style
i
liked
the
nice

color
to
it

left
a
good

a
hint

department

a
pretty
good

better
than
the
american

not

of
its
european
partners
dazzlingly
clear

color
with
a

decent

a

note
as
well
as

completely
free
of

due

the
brown

taste

the

clean
and
a
bit
dry
mouth
feel
is
quite
smooth
and
full
good
for
the
style
the
soft
carbonation
imparts
only
the
slightest
tingle
this
beer
is
another
textbook
example
of
german
brewing
quality
the

the

a

the

metal
definitely
tame
as
the

warms
overall
this
is
a
decent
beer
poured
yellowishgolden
with
a
thin
inconsistent

turned
off
by
the
smell
as
it
almost
had
a
skunky

cant
say
the
taste
was
anything
special
either
it
had
a
bready
texture
with
more
of
a
floral
finish
fortunately
it
was
very
smooth
going
down
i
expected
better
things
as
i
am
typically
a
big
fan
of
the
spaten
line
pours
out
a
clear

with
a

stuck
quite
nicely

really

the

neither

comes
off

clean

nondescript
easy

eurolager
probably
quite
average
in
comparison
to
others
within
its
style
but
easy
drinking
nonetheless
very
easily
to
drink
could
see
this
as
a
good
summer
bbq
beer
if
i
had
the
cash
the
mediumlight
body
has
a
light
but
rounded
maltiness
and
a
crisp
but
faint
bitterness
from
the
hops
very
little
hop
flavor
smooth
and
sweetthis
is
a
beer
ive
used
to
convert
several
macro
guys
to
better
beer
my
complaints
with
it
are
that
its
slightly
too
foamy
and
that
it
leaves
a
slight
sourness
in
the
finish
which
lingers
unpleasantly
ive
had
this
beer
on
draft
at
the
bavarian
grill
where
they
seem
to
take
good
care
of
their
beers
and
its
better
therefirmer
and
less
prone
to
souring
on
the
finish
someday
ill
try
it
in
munich
and
have
a
definitive
answer
blinding

id
recommend
it
for
a
crossover
beer
or
for
hot
summer
days
while
this
is
not
the
best
helles
lager
spaten
premium
is
a
decent
and
enjoyable
beer
as
i
always
beat
on
lagers
and
pilsners
i
must
own
up
to
finding
this
one
quite
pleasant
to
quaff
as
fair
is
fair
and
it
deserves
my
praise
bright
gold
color
as
it
sets
in
the
glass
with
a
spacious
frothy
white
head
and
as
it
dissipates
leaves
a
fine
covering
sheet
of
lace
to
cling
mightily
to
the
glass
sweet
tones
first
then
malt
with
a
light
earthiness
to
end
the
nose
malt
start
with
the
top
light
and
fresh
the
finish
smacking
in
its
acidity
hops
apropos
to
the
style
dry
as
a
desert
bone
aftertaste
and
just
plain
refreshing
pours
a
ultra
clear
very
pale
yellow
with
a
3finger
head
that
shrinks
to
a
nice
lumpy
layer
the
smell
reveals
an
earthy
grain
with
black
pepper
spicing
the
taste
is
a
lightly
sweetened
malt
of
earthy
tones
and
the
hops
that
are
in
the
aromas
are
not
apparent
in
the
taste
very
very
mild
hopping
perhaps
underhopped
it
is
a
very
pleasant
taste
despite
the
lack
of
bite
it
is
a
light
bodied
brew
with
just
a
light
stickysweet
mouthfeel
and
drinkability
is
quite
high
for
this
one
prosit
agreeable
yet
remarkably
average
but
there
is
nothing
here
to
criticize
if
us
macros
were
anything
like
this
id
still
drink
them
pours
a
pale
yellow
color
with
a
thin
white
head
slightly
hoppy
aroma
taste
is
crisp
and
refreshing
with
notes
of
sweet
malts
and
bitter
hops
a
pretty
average
beer
but
a
definite
step
up
from
the
macros
an
average
looking
beer
with
a
clear
golden
color
and
moderate
shortlived
head
the
aroma
was
hops
laden
with
just
a
hint
of
malt
the
flavor
was
slightly
off
victim
of
the
green
bottle
syndrome
but
the
high
hop
content
and
slight
malt
finish
were
refreshing
the
good
carbonation
and
longlasting
flavor
upped
the
mouthfeel
an
easily
drinkable
beer
that
would
be
better
if
fresher
i
anticipate
more
samplings
of
this
style
this
beer
poured
a
light
gold
color
and
formed
a
nice
white
head
that
left
some
lace
some
light
carbonation
present
the
aroma
was
of
hops
and
touch
of
lemon
the
flavor
was
of
hops
and
a
little
lemon
the
finish
was
a
bit
astrigent
and
had
a
bit
of
citrus
to
it
not
bad
for
a
session
beer
but
there
are
better
ones
out
there
quite
ok
with
me
very
pale
yellow
colour
small
head
and
little
lasting
sweetish
maltiness
medium
bitterness
highly
drinkable
fruity
flavour
not
too
bad
in
the
end
i
think
im
buying
greenies
by
the
case
from
now
on
very
light
appearence
with
whiter
than
white
head
sweetish
tasting
but
the
malt
profile
is
somewhat
lacking
in
flavor
goes
down
easy
with
a
creamy
mouthfeel
finish
is
crisp
with
a
little
hop
flavor
and
almost
no
bitterness
a
good
alternative
to
american
macroswill
this
was
a
good
average
lager
not
much
head
tasted
very
similat
ro
stella
artois
which
i
quite
like
a
very
drinkable
beer
like
a
german
budweiser
buy
much
better
quality
munich
lager
goes
down
great
a
bit
light
and
very
smooth
it
is
not
up
there
with
the
hackerpschorr
but
it
is
a
fine
example
of
a
good
german
brew
clear

color
14
inch
head
in
a
pilsner
glass
thats
decently
persistent
slightly
nutty
aroma
lightbodied
malt
is
unobtrusive
but
hops
are
well
balanced
and
lend
just
a
touch
of
crispness
no
annoying

pleasant
finish
a
little
honey
sweetness
i
was
looking
for
more
grain
or
nut
characteristics
not
a
ton
of
memories
here
but
a
very
drinkable
beer
golden
yellow
in
color
with
highly
carbonated
fizzy
white
head
bitter
hop
smell
mixed
with
some
malty
sweetness
made
smell
like
beer
taste
was
somewhat
malty
and
sweet
but
the
bitterness
lingered
to
long
and
was
off
too
bitter
to
be
balanced
light
to
medium
bodied
easy
to
drink
but
not
a
beer
to
really
go
back
to
for
a
while
a
very
nice
example
of
what
a
german
brew
is
and
should
be
it
is
very
refreshing
and
aromatic
at
the
nose
from
the
very
inital
sip
to
the
very
last
it
is
extremely
consistent
and
userfriendly
the
head
is
light
yet
still
lightly
omnipresent
the
aroma
of
the
earthy
malt
and
hops
are
a
fantastic
match
with
all
foods
german
particularly
with
pork
and
sauerkraut
well
worth
seeking
out
prost
gold
in
color
malty
slightly
sweet
nose
white
head
very
smooth
malty
feel
in
the
mouth
some
hop
nobility
not
very
good
head
retention
slightly
above
average
for
the
style
this
was
a
dissapointment
taste
wise
not
really
alot
there
to
comment
on
one
of
the
basic
fine
german
lagers
always
available
reliable
unless
it
has
been
sitting
to
long
in
the
store
it
has
a
nice
golden
color
with
white
head
crips
tasting
with
lingering
bitterness
but
with
enough
smoothness
for
balance
it
a
beer
for
everyday
consupmtion
maybe
this
is
the
massproduced
version
of
german
bud
but
at
least
it
is
good
spaten
premium
very
nice
example
of
the
classic
german
taste
pale
golden
beer
with
a
pure
white
head
the
aroma
reminded
me
of
skunk
but
the
taste
of
the
beer
was
anything
but
sweet
taste
with
a
pleasant
sour
follow
through
and
a
hoppy
dry
absolutely
clean
finish
very
nice
and
very
drinkable
above
average
for
an
american
beer
slightly
below
average
for
a
german
brew
moderatly
malty
with
a
slightly
hoppy
aftertaste
goes
down
pretty
smooth
what
middleage
balding
men
from
germany
drink
after
mowing
thier
lawn
light
lager
nice
thicker
than
expected
head
not
too
intrusive
but
doesnt
lack
character
could
go
well
with
a
meal
i
suspect
but
i
had
it
alone
reminds
me
of
wonderbread
on
the
nose
on
tap
this
is
a
fine
refreshing
lager
bread
like
aroma
puffy
off
white
head
sturdy
malt
backbone
balanced
by
a
welcome
spicy
hop
flavor
good
for
washing
down
a
meal
or
alone
as
a
thirst
quencher
nice
fluffy
white
head
frothy
initially
head
takes
the
larger
part
of
the
glass
then
mostly
diminished
in
a
few
seconds
body
is
light
white
gold
or
platinum
in
color
or
as
i
say
spatennum
the
aroma
has
very
light
malt
hop
notes
herbs
grain
smell
flavor
is
lightly
sweet
finish
is
moderately
bitter
it
has
over
the
top
carbonation
overall
a
very
drinkable
brew
and
surely
a
change
of
pace
as
far
as
lagers
go
first
surprize
came
when
i
poured
it
into
my
glass
very
white
like
champagne
the
head
was
thick
and
creamy
most
of
the
emphasis
is
on
the
malt
a
few
raw
barley
notes
crisp
bite
at
start
creamy
aftertaste
dont
enjoy
many
lagers
but
this
one
is
special
delicious
very
drinkable
lager
a
classic
example
of
the
helles
style
not
my
favorite
though
if
u
lik
helles
although
there
is
a
wee
note
of
cooked
veggies
id
say
that
lux
could
give
munich
a
run
at
its
helles
the
beer
is
straightforward
with
hay
and
a
doughy
sweetness
its
light
body
and
easy
drinking
ability
helps
lux
stand
out
from
the
common
highhopped
ipa
i
really
like
this
lager
by
ninkasi
great
clean
bright
flavor
easy
drinking
and
leaves
your
palate
clean
i
will
definitely
seek
this
out
again
tasty
brew
with
more
heft
than
expected
purists
might
quibble
o
a
superior
blondelight
lager
might
be
one
of
the
best
beers
for
weaning
a
bmc
drinker
to
craft
that
i
have
sampled
im
not
even
a
huge
fan
of
this
style
and
i
really
enjoyed
it
poured
a
gorgeous
clear
golden
body
with
a
one
finger
white
head
that
quickly
receded
to
a
cap
of
lace
the
perfect
appearance
for
the
style
scents
of
sweet
pilsner
malt
light
levels
of
floral
and
slightly
herbal
hops
and
a
light
touch
of

this
is
an
excellent
munich
helles
lager
it
is
very
true
to
form
in
all
respects
and
is
a
well
executed
balanced
beer
while
not
the
headiest
of
examples
of
this
venerable
style
it
does
well
to
emulate
the
best
in
class
of
all
those
tall
boys
that
predominate
liquor
stores
everywhere
and
maybe
even
edge
a

this
is
your
particular
thing
overall
as
a
munich
helles
lager
ninkasi
knocks
this
one
outa
the

well
done
for

im
just
wishing
i
would
like
this
for
me
more
sorry
ninkasi
its
really
good
but
for
me
i
think
i
need
some
food
along
with
it
beautiful

fits
my
taste
better

on

there
is
a
mild

on

with

this

a
good

that
is

but
has
some
nice
subtle

that
keeps

sipping
this
is
more
of
a
pilsner
taste
to
me
but
in
any
case
a
classic
european
flavor
thats
worth
trying
one
of
the
better
ninkasi
brews
and
nice
to
taste
a
lighter
style
with
such
good
results
from
the
12
oz
bottle
purchased
at
bine
vine
in
san
diego
o
this
is
pretty
stylistically
accurate
cant
quit
get
over
the
grain
domination
but
that
happens
with
munich
helles
all
things
being
equal
ninkasi
the
brewery
known
for
fairly
mediocre
beers
is
producing
some
world
class
german
style
lagers
id
prefer
they
shut
down
the
aleworks
and
focus
on
these
german
styles
they
do
it
better
than
anyone
else
on
the
west
coast
possibly
even
the
country
overall
just
a
solid
good
beer
that
really
rocks
the
style
since
ninkasi
has
expanded
they
can
make
more
lagers
and
if
this
is
any
indication
that
is
a
good
choice
on
their
part
definitely
worth
a
try
maybe
the
problem
the
ive
had
with
the
german
versions
is
that
they
havent
been
fresh
this
i
think
is
pretty
fresh
and
it

one
that
i

style
real
low
key
aroma
attributable
for
me
to
a
general
lack
of
hops
which
is
fine
this
is
a
session
ale
consumed
best
in
multiples
holds
a
nice
head
and
its
bubbles
too
and
warms
up
pretty
well
which
is
a
nice
feature
in
the
florida
sun
i
like
it
feeling
a
little
more
substantial
but
in
terms
of
flavor
its
very
in
line
with
style
norms
definitely
not
the
most
adventurous
beer
from
these
guys
but
it
serves
its
purpose
very
well
overall
a
near
textbook
münchner
helles
crisp
clean
and
easy
drinking
perfect
for
a
hot
day
or
in
my
case
a
10c
day
very
reminiscent
of
the
fresh
helles
lagers
i
had
while
i
lived
in
austria
surprised
really
enjoyed
this
beer
pours
a
1
inch
head
that
dissipates
rather
quickly
not
much
lace
left
over
color
is
a
golden
yellow
taste
is
remarkably
smooth
very
bready
with
nice
malt
balance
i
would
take
this
when
im
outside
on
a
hot
summer
day
over
any
domestic
a
very
nice
lager
overall
poured
from
a
can
and
into
a
pilsner
glass
a
light
golden
and
straw
color
modest
head
lacing
showed
some
retention
but
faded
towards
the
end
i
believe
the
power
of
suggestion
played
tricks
on
my
senses
the
title
hotter
than
hells
had
me
believing
that
there
were
some
spices
lo
and
behold
i
thought
i
smelled
hot
pepper
however
i
then
noticed
on
the
bottom
of
the
can
that
it
said
no
pepper
just
puns
in
other
words
the
beers
title
is
a
reference
to
drinking
refreshing
lager
in
hot
weather
and
not
spice
of
course
as
soon
as
i
noticed
this
the
pepper
smell
disappeared
oh
well
so
much
for
my
sense
of
smell
what
i
did
notice
however
was
a
nice
floral
aroma
and
malt
sweetness
similarly
the
taste
contained
these
tones
in
addition
there
were
some
fruity
elements
kind
of
like
a
sweetened
lemon
or
hints
of
orange
also
there
was
a
good
bready
and
malty
backbone
nice
feel
crisp
refreshing
and
light
bodied
definitely
a
summer
drink
and
quite
drinkable
i
would
have
perhaps
liked
a
tad
higher
carbonation
but
maybe
this
would
ruin
the
taste
a
nice
beer
that
i
enjoyed
in
the
winter
next
time
i
will
seek
it
out
in
the
summer
when
it
is
truly
hotter
than
hell
and
make
it
a
session
beer
grabbed
a
can
at
astoria
bier
and
cheese
i
love
a
great
lager
and
this
delivers
its
a
simple
but
tasty
style
and
cigar
city
nails
it
the
malts
are
toasty
and
crisp
with
a
sweet
doughy
bread
and
light
caramel
theres
a
very
subtle
earthy
hops
note
in
the
finish
but
for
the
most
part
this
is
a
lovely
example
of
pale
malts
id
like
to
try
it
sidebyside
with
surly
hell
and
weihenstephaner
original
im
usually
not
a
lager
fan
but
ccb
has
me
sold
on
their
take
of
a
munich
helles
smooth
mouthfeel
complex
for
a
lager
with
just
the
right
amount
of
hop
bite
i
can
see
myself
tubing
with
a
sixpack
on
the
creek
in
the
summer
as
is
implied
this
would
be
an
excellent
summer
or
beach
beer
my
rating
4
lightly
carbonated
this
is
a
highly
drinkable
summer
time
lager
though
it
had
zero
head
retention
nor
lacing
perhaps
i
got
a
lemon
refreshing
drink
however
i
was
just
expecting
a
little
more
good
summer
lager
o
an
excellent
smooth
lager
nothing
bad
to
say
about
it
a
solid
lawnmower
beer
im
thinking
those
peppers
would
have
been
a
pleasant
addition
to
disguise
the
offflavors
it
is
drinkable
to
an
extent
but
im
not
thrilled
easy
to
drink
but
was
hoping
for
more
they
arent
gonna
put
any
bavarian
brewery
out
of
bussiness
thats
for
sure
but
would
drink
it
again
if
my
helles
choices
were
limited

this
is
a
pretty
good
beer
that
is
tasty
and
easy
to
drink
overall
a
touch
over
okay
overall
i
love
my
helles
lager
and
this
one
is
a
touch
off
i
wouldnt
turn
it
down
on
a
hot
day
but
just
okay
in
the
end
overall
not
my
favorite
beer
but
not
bad
for
a
rainy
afternoon
of
vidya
game
playin
again
i
think
it
may
have
skunked
slightly
so
take
this
review
with
a
grain
of
salt
hmm
i
will
make
the
jokes
around
here
thanks
plus
it
is
misleading
the
loud
crack
revealed
a
brimful
craft
can
but
iaw
the
old
ladys
wishes
and
the
directions
on
the
can
the
glug
was
as
gentle
as
could
be
i
still
managed
to
create
a
finger
of
fizzy
bonewhite
head
with
limited
retention
color
was
a
pale
lemonyellow
srm

with
nequality
clarity
nose
smelled
like
german
lager
a
honeylike
sweetness
from
the
malts
underlain
by
a
grassiness
from
the
hops
i
prefer
czechstyle
lagers
but
this
will
do
the
canquest
tm
was
built
on
a
steady
diet
of
aals
and
i
am
very
glad
to
have
those
days
in
the
rear
view
mirror
mouthfeel
was
mediumtofull
more
effervescent
than
i
might
have
expected
and
the
taste
was
really
sweet
in
fact
it
was
too
sweet
for
my
taste
i
would
not
have
minded
a
pepper
presence
at
all
as
opposed
to
this
very
honeylike
but
i
have
some
blue
dog
mead
that
will
satisfy
that
craving
when
the
time
comes
finish
was
likewise
sweet
and
now
i
found
myself
looking
forward
to
on
of
their
many
canned
ipas
to
wash
away
the
taste
its
a
fine
drinkable
brew
but
it
comes
off
almost
like
a
euro
lager
than
a
helles
surprised
this
held
up
as
well
as
it
did
solid
offering
on
a
fairly
uncommon
style
a
hint
of
metallic
character
emerges
late
overall
i
consider
cigar
city
to
be
the
surly
of
minnesota
but
this
kinda
sucks
surly
hell
or
even
maui
bikini
blonde
are
much
better
hells
lagers
id
rather
have
a
corona
its
funny
how
a
beer
can
have
very
little
complexity
but
truly
taste
really
good
this
is
dead
on
the
style
with
a
smooth
grain
flavor
barley
and
bread
with
a
slight
tinge
of
hops
this
is
light
and
so
easy
to
drink
that
it
can
be
easily
deceptive
i
dont
expect
a
lot
out
of
any
lager
but
i
find
this
to
be
one
of
my
favorites
as
it
has
pronounced
lager
properties
and
easy
lager
drinkability
od
fairly
drinkable
but
they
could
have
done
so
much
more
with
this
one
good
craft
lager
but
nothing
to
write
home
about
in
general
decent
pretty
good
beer
poured
at
a
good

a
nice

a

all
that
much
o
ccbs
super
drinkable
beer
if
you
arent
a
jai
alai
fan
like
me
just
too
delicate
and
mundane
in
my
opinion
but
if
this
is
your
style
than
definitely
worth
a
try
this
beer
might
be
better
on
tap
or
in
a
bottle
i
have
generally
like
cigar
city
beers
so
this
is
may
least
favorite
o
a
grat
option
on
a
hot
summer
day
its
very
refreshing
and
drinkable
while
not
sacrificing
taste
o
this
was
a
true
wow
beer
in
its
style
class
bravo
picked
this
one
up
while
on
vacation
in
daytona
beach
poured
from
12
oz
can
into
a

glass
pours
cloudy
light

outstanding
thick

well
slightly

of
lemon
mouthfeel
is
thin

carbonated
refreshing
perfect
for
summer
overall
a
great
hot
weather
beer
flavorful
satisfying
delicious
this
brewery
never
disappoints
on
a
side
note
i
think
that
cigar
city
may
need
to
rename
this
beer
being
a
beer
geek
i
never
realized
that
the
name
makes
people
think
the
beer
is
spicy
but
ive
had
people
ask
me
if
its
made
with
peppers
when
you
have
to
explain
twice
on
the
label
that
the
beer
doesnt
have
any
hot
peppers
or
spices
in
it
i
think
you
have
a
problem
o
refreshing
but
not
my
cup
of
tea
i
havent
had
too
many
lagers
but
this
is
nice
overall
not
a
bad
brew
glad
i
tried
it
but
i
will
not
have
this
one
again
o
when
youre
dealing
with
a
brewery
as
extreme
as
ccb
helles
lagers
are
the
last
thing
you
expect
or
want
to
find
but
this
one
does
well
as
far
as
easy
drinking
summer
beers
go
better
than
average
appearance
for
a
lager
nice
lacing
down
the
sides
of
the
glass
you
get
your
typical
lager
aroma
nothing
to
special
taste
is
very
pleasant
very
smooth
this
wont
blow
you
away
but
if
you
like
lagers
this
is
one
to
get
and
share
around
with
those
friends
who
only
drink
budweiser
o
i
feel
like
i
have
been
ruined
on
lagers
because
the
budweisers
of
the
world
but
this
was
remarkably
delicious
restored
my
faith
mmm
graininess
really
shines
like
a
munich
helles
very
well
done
indeed
hops
are
light
and
add
just
enough
grassy
hop
dryness
on
the
finish
old
world
hallertau
hops
are
definitely
evident
mouthfeel
is
a
little
richer
than
the
imports
and
has
less
carbonation
overall
a
pretty
nice
take
on
the
style
and
one
of
the
more
authentic
versions
brewed
in
america
7

for
a
6
pk
o
a
little
disappointed
with
this
offering
from
cigar
city
better
options
out
there
for
the
style
not
a
ton
to
it
but
there
doesnt
need
to
be
snappy
tasty
good
for
a
hot
day
overall
a
nice
enjoyable
munich
helles
from
cigar
city
does
well
to
rival
many
of
the
german
offerings
some
of
which
are
considered
the
best
lagers
on
the
planet
great
summer
beer
as
recommended
on
the
can
helles
means
bright
in
german
this
beer
exudes
brightness
oa
great
beer
on
a
hot
day
crisp
easy
drinking
and
refreshing
that
being
said
it
doesnt
over
come
the
lawnmower
status
o
the
one
thing
i
have
locally
is
plenty
of
well
crafted
lagers
so
this
not
being
available
here
is
no
big
deal
having
said
that
its
a
nice
beer
and
the
folks
in
florida
looking
for
a
lager
should
drink
it
up
the
beer
pours
a
straw
yellow
with
a
fizzy
soap
bubble
head
that
goes
away
quickly
and
leaves
a
little
scrim
the
beers
body
is
quite
clear
with
just
a
slight
haze
to
it
and
a
steady
stream
of
lazy
bubbles
working
to
the
top
of
the
glass
on
the
nose
the
beer
smells
sweet
and
grassy
almost
like
a
very
dry
strawberry
smell
with
touches
of
bread
the
malt
is
super
sweet
and
fruity
on
the
nose
but
the
grassy
hop
backing
gives
a
balance
to
the
smell
and
makes
this
beer
more
inviting
to
the
nose
on
the
tongue
the
beer
tastes
sweet
with
a
finish
of
smooth
grassy
bitter
hops
the
flavors
begin
as
sweet
bready
malt
with
a
faint
touch
of
fruity
strawberry
this
dries
out
slowly
and
becomes
progressively
bitterer
grassy
flavors
with
nuances
of
sweet
malt
and
very
slight
green
pepper
notes
the
finish
is
creamy
sweet
bread
malts
that
linger
nicely
into
the
aftertaste
and
slowly
dissipate
onto
the
palate
leaving
grassy
bitter
to
tingle
on
the
tongue
in
the
can
the
beer
smells
weak
with
very
little
of
its
nuances
escaping
through
the
hole
it
tastes
less
sweet
when
sipped
from
the
can
with
none
of
the
fruity
malts
but
a
nice
bitter
grassy
hops
kiss
it
tastes
slightly
more
refreshing
from
the
can
but
not
as
complex
or
nuanced
in
the
mouth
the
beer
feels
slightly
prickly
in
carbonation
which
helps
to
balance
out
the
sweetness
of
the
beer
the
beer
also
feels
medium
thick
in
body
the
mouth
is
left
clean
but
with
a
nice
swath
of
saliva
dribbling
on
the
tongue
overall
i
like
this
beer
it
is
sweet
but
balanced
well
with
hops
and
carbonation
and
it
is
refreshing
and
interesting
on
the
palate
a
great
sessionable
sipper
from
cigar
city
o
great
helles
lager
very
drinkable
and
very
enjoyable
good
try
but
could
use
some
more
work
to
really
nail
the
style
o
a
great
beach
summertime
brew
perfect
for
the
tampa
shores
medium
straw
color
with
a
thin
head
that
disappears
quickly
and
leaves
little
behind
on
the
glass
smell
is
melon
with
a
touch
of
banana
taste
is
mild
malt
with
a
touch
of
pepper
and
a
bready
aftertaste
feel
is
light
to
medium
heaviness
and
a
little
fizzy
at
first
but
the
carbonation
drops
off
a
touch
after
a
couple
of
minutes
overall
this
is
drinkable
and
refreshing
its
not
particularly
complex
just
enough
to
be
interesting
this
is
not
one
of
my
favorite
styles
but
this
is
done
well
and
is
quite
good
for
a
nice
warm
day
overall
having
easy
access
to
this
one
ill
probably
revisit
from
time
to
time
and
this
is
a
great
summer
beer
for
myself
i
think
it
has
enough
going
on
in
the
taste
where
ill
discover
more
and
more
after
each
one
nice
yellow
color
very
balanced
taste
you
can
totally
taste
the
cracker
beer
feels
very
light
and
refreshing
another
addition
to
one
of
my
faves
or
go
to
beers
abv
is
about
5
and
smooth
very
tastey
o
extremely
refreshing
and
super
drinkable
lager
has
a
nice
soft
fruity
quality
to
it
while
still
being
very
much
a
lager
would
have
again
soft
in
feel
with
a
quickly
exiting
carbonation
leaving
things
a
bit
viscous
on
the
finish
overall
intriguing
given
the
funkiness
but
likely
prefer
a
cleaner
continental
variant
of
the
style
as
for
a
regular
quaff
i
havent
really
been
disappointed
by
anything
from
cigar
city
and
this
is
no
exception
especially
considering
i
really
wasnt
expecting
much
from
it
at
all
very
clean
and
refreshing
with
some
mild
citrus
and
hop
flavors
along
with
a
clean
lager
profile
certainly
something
nice
to
enjoy
on
a
hot
day
poured
from
a
can
slightly
acidic
finish
nice
hops
balance
i
wish
there
was
a
little
more
maltiness
a
little
thin
on
the
malt
overall
a
great
can
of
beer
and
considering
i
am
only
about
4
hours
drive
from
there
its
pretty
fresh
yeah
its
in
a
can
but
i
get
it
closer
than
others
i
feel
like
that
if
there
were
a
little
more
malt
finish
the
helles
style
would
be
complete
it
finishes
a
little
thin
for
my
idea
of
the
style
based
on
soem
of
the
incredible
import
examples
of
the
style
maybe
not
a
continental
pilsner
malt
but
a
german
or
belgian
one
o
a
solid
light
lager
but
i
wish
it
was
boiled
a
bit
longer
to
drive
off
the
dms
cost
8
99
for
a
six
pack
of
cans
enjoyed
at
the
cc
tasting
room
light
yellow
with
a
large
retained
head
tasty
it
yields
both
sweet
and
sour
interplay
like
a
dirty
yeasty
blonde
flvour
with
a
chile
pepper
finish
yet
no
spices
were
included
good
that
cc
is
doing
these
beers
a
good
late
day
beer
ok
drinkability
overall
a
great
beer
for
camping
trips
or
tailgating
for
sure
its
very
refreshing
and
goes
down
fast
not
sure
how
true
to
style
it
is
but
its
still
a
tasty
beer
worth
trying
o
very
nice
drinking
brew
here
light
and
tasty
great
beer
for
a
hot
summer
day
i
cant
imagine
helles
being
all
that
hot
anyway
this
stuff
pours
a
clear
straw
topped
by
a
finger
or
so
of
lightly
offwhite
foam
the
nose
comprises
wheat
sweet
flowers
and
a
kiss
of
grass
the
taste
brings
in
more
of
the
same
though
with
a
bit
more
of
both
the
flowers
and
the
grass
the
body
is
pretty
light
with
a
light
moderate
carbonation
and
a
fluid
feel
overall
this
is
a
nice
little
helles
nothing
earthshattering
but
its
not
meant
to
be
its
a
pleasant
session
beer
perfect
for
those
who
need
a
lighter
option
when
the
weather
turns
all
floridian
and
whatnot
o
really
was
looking
forward
to
trying
this
one
sadly
was
disappointed
to
be
fair
i
am
far
from
a
fan
of
pils
this
is
a
big
more
complex
with
the
bigger
malts
but
far
from
the
more
complex
brews
out
there
the
beer
is
transparent
and
pale
yellow
with
a
half
inch
of
white
head
a
fine
appearance
the
aroma
is
subtle
with
notes
of
bread
grain
a
touch
of
yeast
smells
good
the
taste
is
more
aggressive
light
and
bready
refreshing
and
crisp
with
appropriate
carbonation
a
solid
example
of
the
style
medium
bodied
but
fuller
than
expected
especially
considering
the
appearance
light
crisp
hops
followed
by
some
earthy
grassstraw
character
as
well
as
some
bready
yeast
and
light
fruit
some
apple
and
pear
provided
sweetness
that
counters
the
earthy
hop
character
well
balanced
light
and
very
easy
to
drink
o
ok
to
good
for
a
lager
just
not
my
preference
i
dont
think
ill
get
again
o
i
really
enjoyed
this
beer
and
it
reminded
me
of
drinking
a
helles
under
the
chestnut
trees
in
a
munich
biergarten
hotter
than
helles
pours
out
a
very
bright
golden
yellowish
color
with
a
clear
body
not
any
haze
in
the
way
a
nice
bright
white
cap
on
top
with
some
legs
but
no
stick
good
retention
bubbles
smell
is
pretty
pale
malted
up
with
some
underlining
spicy
hop
notes
i
get
some
fruity
scents
but
that
may
be
from
the
previous
beer
on
tap
taste
is
helles
than
i
get
the
fruity
flavor
as
well
which
kinda
kills
it
for
me
rich
german
hop
flavor
and
malt
mixes
well
with
a
light
enough
body
but
i
am
unsure
of
the
semi
fruit
flavor
i
am
getting
feel
is
on
point
light
and
spritzy
carb
a
nice
hop
bite
towards
the
end
i
was
hoping
for
more
perhaps
i
am
spoiled
by
all
the
great
german
style
offerings
local
to
us
in
sepa
but
hotter
than
helles
was
a
dud
pale
yellow
in
color
with
a
deep
haze
poured
with
a
foamy
bright
white
head
that
reduced
to
a
sticky
dense
cap
biscuity
sweet
malt
aroma
with
hints
of
floral
hops
and
an
earthy
grass
character
aggressive
somewhat
fizzy
carbonation
up
front
that
turns
buttery
smooth
through
the
middle
biscuit
malt
and
floral
hop
bitter
flavors
with
a
applelike
sweetness
in
the
background
the
hop
flavors
peak
toward
the
end
with
a
tangy
twist
of
he
taste
buds
finishes
crisply
with
a
slightly
tart
aftertaste
single
finger
clear
straw
colored
body
some
lacing
aroma
is
grassy
grainy
and
light
malts
the
body
is
much
fuller
than
i
was
expecting
with
high
carbonation
very
refreshing
and
highly
drinkable
flavor
of
bitter
hops
like
noble
hops
but
mildly
so
with
a
nice
malt
profile
and
grassy
notes
for
my
tastes
one
of
the
best
mouthfeels
and
flavors
of
a
helles
i
have
had
o
this
is
a
pretty
tasty
lager
i
was
glad
to
try
a
fairly
rare
cigar
city
brew
at
tap
42
a
nice
golden
brew
with
a
finger
and
a
half
head
receded
slowly
the
smell
is
nice
cereal
grains
with
a
touch
of
flora
great
bready
crackery
taste
with
the
slightest
hint
of
hops
very
refreshing
and
extremely
quaffable
beer
is
light
and
wet
good
finish
clean
and
crisp
the
yeast
shows
up
in
the
late
forward
palate
a
little
thicker
mouthfeel
than
i
expected
and
a
good
finish
on
the
end
id
have
this
again
i
had
it
twice
while
in
fl
o
overall
i
liked
this
one
i
thought
it
was
a
very
easy
to
drink
lager
and
is
pretty
light
and
refreshing
nose
is
pretty
nice
while
the
taste
has
more
grains
and
wheat
would
have
it
again
could
be
a
good
springsummer
beer
o
not
a
bad
beer
good
lager
taste
with
some
distinctive
honey
sweetness
worth
trying
o
overall
this
isnt
a
bad
beer
i
was
expecting
a
little
bit
more
from
cigar
city
after
trying
their
jai
alai
but
for
a
helles
lager
which
usually
dont
have
much
as
far
as
flavor
this
is
damn
delicious
it
poured
a
bright
cloudy
thick
yellow
with
a
small
head
wasnt
much
to
the
smell
maybe
because
i
was
in
a
bar
tasted
like
a
buttery
beer
i
couldnt
get
past
that
it
wasnt
very
good
it
was
fairly
thick
and
creamy
and
honestly
felt
and
tasted
like
a
pilsner
mixed
with
melted
butter
i
did
not
enjoy
this
and
was
very
disappointed
i
love
the
brewery
and
everything
i
have
had
by
them
until
this
one
this
beer
pours
a
bright
golden
straw
color
that
has
nice
clarity
there
is
about
a
finger
of
white
head
resting
on
top
the
head
has
good
retention
and
it
leaves
a
nice
bit
of
lace
behind
on
the
glass
the
nose
is
of
grainy
malt
sweetness
there
is
also
some
fruitiness
honey
spicy
hops
and
some
earthy
grassiness
the
taste
followed
what
the
nose
suggested
it
started
off
with
some
grainy
malt
sweetness
there
are
some
nice
flavors
of
honey
fruit
and
some
earthiness
also
there
is
an
earthy
spicy
hop
presence
the
finish
leaves
some
lingering
earthiness
hop
presence
and
the
sweet
maltiness
behind
on
the
palate
this
has
a
medium
body
and
good
carbonation
it
goes
down
really
easy
and
it
has
a
really
smooth
feel
to
it
there
is
some
sweetness
at
first
and
then
a
nice
earthiness
comes
in
and
balances
it
out
also
there
is
some
spice
and
bitterness
from
the
hops
that
is
really
nice
it
has
a
nice
refreshing
quality
to
it
there
is
really
good
drinkability
here
i
could
easily
have
a
few
pints
of
this
in
a
night
it
goes
down
really
easy
has
nice
flavor
and
is
pretty
refreshing
overall
i
think
it
is
just
a
solid
beer
and
i
recommend
trying
it
out
i
would
buy
this
one
again
i
can
see
it
being
really
nice
on
a
hot
summer
day
i
hope
i
run
into
it
again
lighter
body
higher
carbonation
clean
and
crisp
on
the
tongue
really
refreshing
a
nice
lager
enhanced
by
a
blast
of
citrus
o
as
far
as
a
helles
bock
is
concerned
this
is
good
but
for
my
tastes
it
falls
a
bit
short
the
head
retention
and
the
aroma
were
way
off
but
the
flavor
and
mouthfeel
are
on
par
good
beer
for
a
hot
summer
afternoon
or
a
tailgate
party
but
i
prefer
a
bit
more
complexity
overall
an
ok
version
of
the
style
a
little
off
oim
enjoying
this
its
a
very
tasty
lager
that
one
could
drink
all
night
long
just
for
those
who
want
to
know
i
am
a
lager
fan
though
i
cant
wait
for
this
to
come
out
in
cans
despite
the
nose
not
giving
up
a
whole
lot
i
thought
that
this
was
quite
a
solid
take
on
a
helles
with
a
flavorful
and
well
balanced
crispness
that
was
very
accessible
and
inviting
on
the
palate
this
one
is
worth
a
look
overall
good
beer
overall
worth
a
shot
if
you
see
it
on
draft
mouth
feel
is
smooth
and
crisp
full
carbonation
medium
light
body
super
drinkable
cigar
city
please
consider
canning
this
guy
mediimbodied
maybe
leaning
fuller
good
effervescence
with
a
nice
tanginess
on
the
tongue
some
white
grape
and
corn
notes
throughout
he
aftertaste
to
keep
the
malt
company
for
a
first
or
second
lager
ever
this
is
pretty
good
mind
im
not
a
lager
person
was
looking
for
the
360
top
can
couldnt
find
it
but
regardless
found
the
beer
pours
light
yellow
finger
of
pillowy
head
smell
is
subtle
yeast
and
hops
sweet
at
first
then
the
hoppy
bite
but
not
bitter
very
clean
and
crisp
would
buy
again
although
the
carbonation
was
very
high
and
caused
painful
burps
haha
a
bit
too
sweet
for
my
tastes
not
good
dont
liek
at
all
in
lieu
of
putting
their
own
spin
on
this
beer
its
clear
the
brewer
wanted
to
stay
true
to
the
style
and
they
absolutely
nailed
it
why
there
arent
more
american
versions
of
helles
is
beyond
me
this
is
not
only
an
outstanding
version
of
the
style
but
for
7
89
sixpack
it
is
also
a
great
value
recommended
to
anyone
looking
for
a
clean
lager
with
some
character
golden
bronze
body
clear
with
a
small
white
cap
aromas
of
pils
malt
a
hint
of
sweet
fruity
notes
grain
and
bread
with
distant
floral
notes
and
a
clean
feel
easy
to
drink
not
too
sweet
light
saaz
hop
character
solid
i
had
two
of
these
over
dinner
the
other
night
and
they
were
soso
that
said
id
like
to
try
it
outside
of
the
can
for
those
that
get
a
chance
please
try
the
new
360
top
and
drink
it
right
from
the
can
that
invention
is
fantastic
as
you
really
get
the
full
effect
of
the
nose
with
the
entire
lid
off
but
the
convenience
of
a
can
these
are
the
perfect
summer
beer
for
whatever
reason
beach
lawn
porch
whatever
love
them
this
is
a
medium
bodied
brew
with
s
modest
amount
of
carbonation
it
is
crisp
and
easy
drinking
it
plays
the
part
of
the
style
well
if
this
was
a
style
i
got
thirsty
for
id
reach
for
it
again
o
definitely
showcases
the
german
malts
nicely
but
at
the
expense
of
any
noticeable
contribution
from
the
czech
pilsen
hops
this
golden
lager
is
very
light
and
easy
to
drink
i
enjoy
this
beer
very
much
the
german
pips
malt
really
stands
out
in
the
taste
and
the
hallertauer
hops
are
the
perfect
choice
to
put
a
hint
of
bitterness
in
the
after
taste
i
would
recommend
this
beer
for
a
tailgate
or
on
the
beach
o
for
an
american
brewery
its
hard
to
do
a
better
helles
lager
very
sessionable

a
good
example
of
the
style
to
the
point
take
on
the
style
its
not
my
favourite
style
in
the
world
so
id
be
apt
to
grab
something
else
off
of
the
beer
list
popular
brew
but
did
not
impress
me
overall
this
is
a
decent
clean
plain
lager
nothing
special
or
great
just
clean
and
unassuming
there
are
no
harsh
adjunctlike
flavors
just
toasted
malt
and
caramel
it
would
be
an
excellent
entrylevel
craft
beer
for
noncraft
beer
drinkers
i
cracked
it
open
and
when
nothing
untoward
occurred
i
began
an
inverted
glug
i
netted
a
brief
finger
of
fizzy
bonewhite

with
limited
retention
color
was

with

but
it
was

whoops
nose
held
a
pleasant

obviously
adjunctfree
and
i
was
drooling
in
anticipation
i
really
love
drinking
nonaal
lagers
having
been
subjected
to
so
many
of
those
losers
in
the
early
days
of
the
canquest
tm
mouthfeel
was
thin
not
necessarily
watery
but
not
much
past
it
the
taste
was
fairly
innocuous
lightly
sweet
but
not
discernibly
hopped
it
was
another
totally
crushable
beer
especially
given
its
low
abv
todays
lagers
could
all
easily
go
into
my
summer
cooler
with
no
canplaint
finish
was
semisweet
very
light
in
terms
of
body
and
taste
still
it
beats
any
of
those
aals
that
i
mentioned
earlier
pours
a
pale
clear
gold
with
a
fizzy
white
head
that
burns
off
pretty
quickly
leaving
just
a
little
bit
of
carbonation
at
the
middle
no
lacing
the
aroma
is
delicate
with
stronger
notes
of
bread
and
lighter
hints
of
herbs
the
taste
is
uncomplicated
but
tasty
bigger
malt
tones
of
bread
and
light
fruit
are
balanced
by
a
nice
earthy
hops
finish
the
body
is
light
with
just
a
hint
of
carbonation
an
easydrinker
and
flavorful
lager
the
beer
is
crystal
clear
and
pale
yellow
with
a
small
white
head
aromas
of
grain
cracker
lager
yeast
some
fruity
malt
notes
in
the
flavor
with
a
grainy
presence
thought
finishing
with
a
touch
of
earthy
bitterness
this
was
ok
a
nice
micro
lawnmower
kind
of
beer
clean
and
refreshing
decent
beer
aroma
seems
a
little
like
the
cheaper
beers
on
the
market
nice
golden
color
and
decent
head
flavor
is
good
slightly
germanlike
which
is
fine
flavor
goes
away
fast
and
leaves
you
wanting
a
little
more
overall
a
good
beer
made
by
a
decent
brewery
well
done
this
beer
is
quite
the
easy
drinker
has
a
nice
german
lager
appearance
clear
yellow
highly
carbonated
with
1
finger
head
that
doesnt
hold
very
well
has
the
scent
of
adjunct
beer
so
not
the
best
smelling
beer
has
a
very
solid
flavor
profile
very
authentic
to
german
originators
and
hits
all
the
marks
only
downside
is
i
find
it
a
little
dry
in
the
finish
thus
not
quite
as
thirst
quenching
for
the
style
otherwise
this
is
a
fine
beer
and
well
done
to
the
style
by
devils
backbone
o
i
liked
gll
but
it
has
a
few
tweaks
in
lowering
the
hop
bitterness
a
few
ibus
and
upping
the
carbonation
a
tad
still
a
refreshing
brew
great
for
summer
o
nothing
special
but
certainly
not
bad
devils
backbone
hasnt
impressed
me
yet
and
unfortunately
this
one
doesnt
do
enough
to
sway
me
from
that
thought
there
are
some
worthwhile
aspects
to
it
at
least
its
easy
to
drink
and
refreshing
like
a
lager
should
be
along
with
a
touch
just
a
touch
of
complexity
i
certainly
wouldnt
refuse
a
free
canpour
of
it
again
o
wow
this
beer
comes
close
to
weienstephaner
imo
its
such
a
simple
tasting
beer
but
its
crafted
masterfully
so
drinkable
yet
the
floral
notes
keep
you
wanting
more
im
glad
that
this
isnt
hard
to
find
around
me
because
ill
be
getting
more
for
sure
o
well
i
love
this
the
pour
was
fairly
disappointing
but
after
that
its
all
thumbs
way
up
the
uninitiated
will
drink
this
beer
and
say
it
tastes
like
miller
lite
those
in
the
throes
and
heights
of
beer
fever
will
criticize
this
for
a
lack
of
complexity
but
those
of
us
who
have
gone
through
our
bmc
days
become
craft
beer
geeks
driven
all
over
town
to
buy
up
the
monthly
rare
releases
and
have
now
settled
into
where
we
just
appreciate
wellmade
beers
especially
those
with
subtlety
will
rightfully
praise
this
amazing
creation
from
devils
backbone
its
straightforward
a
simple
nose
and
flavor
profile
but
heck
if
this
isnt
one
of
the
best
beers
ive
had
this
year
its
refreshing
its
tasty
and
its
impeccably
made
the
helles
lager
style
is
unforgiving
to
brewers
who
arent
at
the
top
of
their
game
fortunately
for
devils
backbone
they
put
on
a
clinic
with
gold
leaf
lager
this
will
be
in
my
fridge
all
summer
long
odd
that
i
found
it
more
aromatic
while
others
found
it
more
tasty
but
i
admit
i
liked
the
taste
better
by
the
time
i
reached
the
bottom
of
my
glass
still
the
aroma
wins
hands
down
for
me
a
good
light
summer
brew
i
wouldnt
hesitate
to
try
it
again
color
is
golden
yellow
with
a
nice
and
fluffy
but
quickly
dissipating
head
nose
is
biscuity
a
little
grassy
and
not
much
hops
taste
is
well
its
pretty
good
kind
of
like
a
what
macro
lager
tastes
like
in
a
dream
sweet
up
front
progressing
through
some
crispness
and
finishing
nice
and
dry
cant
really
put
a
finger
on
what
hops
were
used
but
i
cant
say
that
i
really
care
either
its
a
good
solid
fun
drinkin
beer
id
love
to
take
a
case
with
me
on
a
boat
or
tailgating
beer
is
light
in
body
sweet
yeasty
nice
mildly
hoppy
semidry
finish
a
decent
lager
id
probably
have
it
again
id
definitely
try
other
lagers
from
this
brewery
overall
it
doesnt
smell
like
the
brew
is
going
to
deliver
but
it
does
quite
nicely
and
in
a
strange
way
makes
it
seem
much
better
than
its
going
to
be
nice
job
clean
and
drinkable
with
a
solid
hop
presence
this
is
a
lager
you
can
session
nicely
done
pours
a
clear
yellow
color
with
a
good
white
head
and
a
bit
of
spotty
lacing
on
the
sides
thin
collar
throughout
good
balance
between
some
light
hops
and
crisp
grainy
malt
slight
straw
and
grain
throughout
in
both
the
nose
and
flavor
good
noble
hop
presence
light
body
and
good
carbonation
really
crisp
great
example
of
the
style
drinkability
this
beer
is
a
real
session
lager
as
the
flavor
profile
will
keep
you
interested
for
a
while
nice
beer
i
prefer
real
gold
to
leaf
but
maybe
thats
just
me
this
brew
pours
a
clear
pale
straw
topped
by
a
finger
of
white
foam
the
nose
is
faint
comprising
light
wheat
florals
and
a
very
light
kiss
of
citrus
insert
lil
kiss
reference
here
the
taste
has
more
weight
with
notes
of
floral
bitters
light
biscuityness
and
a
light
citrus
bit
the
body
is
light
with
a
light
carbonation
and
a
crisp
dry
finish
overall
a
pretty
decent
light
lager
nothing
to
write
home
about
but
nice
and
refreshing
in
this
ridiculous
humidity
dwhoa
this
is
nice
stuff
while
this
style
is
not
among
my
favorites
when
it
is
done
this
well
it
is
hard
to
deny
the
fat
that
this
brew
is
very
well
done
no
wonder
it
won
a
gabf
gold
easy
to
drink
and
refreshing
an
excellent
warm
weather
session
beer
well
done
drinkability
if
the
aroma
had
been
a
little
more
pleasantly
pungent
this
would
have
been
a
really
solid
beer
its
still
a
good
beer
just
not
quite
what
it
can
be
i
think
very
refreshing
crisp
decently
flavorful
like
the
vienna
lager
i
think
this
would
make
a
good
sitting
outside
on
the
patio
in
august
overlooking
the
scenic
vista
of
the
southern
shenandoahs
beer
ill
almost
certainly
be
making
it
one
too
im
going
to
proclaim
this
a
good
helles
minor
mouthfeel
issues
notwithstanding
this
is
supposed
to
be
a
low
hop
flavor
style
great
german
malt
flavor
the
overall
okay
designation
provided
here
is
a
mystery
solid
lager
across
the
board
simple
complex
the
hop
bite
is
present
but
not
overbearing
and
thoroughly
drinkable
wish
it
was
seventy
degrees
warmer
i
think
i
got
a
bad
one
it
did
not
taste
right
taste
brings
some
lemon
and
a
balancing
pils
malt
light
bready
character
pleasant
finish
slightly
sweet
simple
style
done
fairly
well
though
still
just
an
old
school
all
malt
lager
with
a
slightly
more
complex
mouthfeel
easy
and
unobtrusive
good
lager
very
unoriginal
leaves
a
pungent
taste
on
the
tongue
similar
to
a
budweiser
not
recommended
at
all
but
on
that
note
this
beer
could
have
been
way
worse
ojust
not
a
very
good
beer
o
aftertaste
throws
me
for
a
loop
a
decent
helles
lager
fairly
true
to
style
light
3
255
c
hay
colored
and
crystal
clear
a
bit
light
on
flavor
and
abv
for
the
style
but
not
a
bad
overall
experience
mildly
refreshing
not
all
that
different
from
living
the
high
life
wish
it
had
a
bit
more
head
overall

this
beer
started
off
promising
and
kind
of
did
a
landslide
from
there
i
would
say
that
this
is
like
an
advanced
slightly
craftier
miller
high
life
except
for
the
fact
that
high
life
is
perfectly
good
on
its
own
so
why
bother
summer
helles
is
probably
better
than
some
beers
in
the
lager
category
but
you
may
as
well
pick
up
a
macro
because
you
arent
gaining
much
here
overall
a
highly
drinkable
lager
maybe
a
little
sweet
but
i
could
probably
knock
back
quite
a
few
of
these
id
definitely
have
this
again
overall
pretty
nice
helles
lager
pretty
nice
for
this
humid
orlando
weather
o
well
done
lager
by
new
belgium
got
this
one
at
krogers
in
frankenmuth
mi
in
may
drank
in
new
hamburg
on
aug
19th
2014
its
a
refreshing
lager
duh
a
little
lacking
on
the
spiceynoble
hop
character
got
a
nice
cereal
malt
character
though
it
is
what
it
is
ive
had
better
summer
lagers
gansett
victory
and
the
german
varieties
are
definitely
superior
youd
be
hard
pressed
to
strongly
detest
this
beer
though
the
taste
has
a
mildly
toasted
malt
character
with
gentle
sweetness
and
light
spice
from
the
yeast
with
a
floral
flavor
from
the
hops
with
a
slight
yeast
flavor
continuing
into
the
finish
with
some
mineral
accents
i
consider
this
a
pretty
decent
lager
in
the
sense
it
fits
the
style
not
great
but
certainly
worth
a
try
it
is
drinkable
and
good
for
summer
drinking
2

boring
lager
is
boring
it
smells
tinny
lemongrass
and
looks
clear
and
pale
like
the
lagers
flowing
in
a
paulaner
or
augustiner
bräuhaus
in
downtown
munich
but
most
importantly
it
tastes
almost
as
good
pours
a
clear
seethru
golden
body
with
minimal
head
and
lace
streak
down
glass
aroma
is
pils
malt
and
grain
and
not
much
else
but
isnt
bad
beer
is
light
bodied
not
watery
but
close
crisp
with
a
touch
of
fruit
sweetness
and
hoppy
bitterness
but
mostly
i
get
a
grainy
maltiness
to
the
beer
an
easy
to
drink
light
german
beer
but
that
isnt
bad
but
there
are
much
better
versions
of
this
beer
out
there
o
easy
drinking
summer
bee
not
on
the
level
of
the
german
originals
but
very
drinkable
at
the
beach
so
i
been
drinking
adjunct
lager
for
the
most
part
of
the
day
budweiser
but
had
to
have
a
six
pack
of
craft
the
pour
is
clear
with
slight
lace
the
smell
is
slight
grass
with
a
biscuit
the
taste
is
smooth
slight
sweet
barley
biscuit
overall
really
not
much
different
then
the
bud
i
been
drinking
all
week
just
without
the
adjunct
taste
when
it
warms
its
slighty
better
then
the
bud
but
really
the
crazy
price
i
payed
here
at
the
beach
9
99
i
rather
just
buy
some
more
bud
its
summer
so
why
the
hell
not
have
a
new
nb
seasonal
this
one
pours
a
clear
straw
topped
by
a
halffinger
or
so
of
lightly
offwhite
foam
the
nose
comprises
thick
grass
mild
greenery
and
dry
flaky
white
bread
the
taste
brings
in
more
of
the
same
the
bread
subduing
the
grass
a
bit
though
not
enough
to
take
control
of
the
situation
nor
to
actually
achieve
much
of
a
character
of
its
own
despite
its
best
efforts
the
body
is
a
hefty
light
with
a
light
moderate
carbonation
and
a
sortakinda
drying
finish
overall
not
a
bad
little
helles
really
i
could
see
drinking
more
though
it
wouldnt
likely
be
the
first
bottle
i
reach
for
in
such
a
situation
overall
i
say
this
was
a
pretty
good
beer
that
i
would
have
again
good
for
summer
absolutely
better
than
rolle
bolle
or
even
skinny
dip
im
not
so
sure
say
what
you
will
about
the
style
this
beer
gets
it
right
in
every
aspect
its
enjoyable
but
so
are
so
many
beers
which
are
much
cheaper
and
more
available
nothing
special
here
besides
smoothness
in
my
opinion
and
the
lacing
around
the
beer
glass
makes
it
seem
like
its
more
of
a
10
6
pack
than
it
tastes
much
deeper
flavor
than
something
like
a
bud
but
not
that
far
off
overall
this
is
an
outstanding
version
of
a
munich
helles
lager
moderately
maltforward
but
very
wellbalanced
dms
is
a
normal
byproduct
of
brewing
with
pilsner
malts
and
acceptable
in
the
style
but
a
little
overboard
on
the
nose
here
otherwise
a
great
beer
when
rated
to
style
and
a
very
drinkable
summer
beer
started
brightly
but
faded
quicker
than
a
summer
sunset
if
they
could
get
those
interesting
characteristics
from
the
smell
to
come
through
in
the
taste
id
be
sold
o
nb
summer
helles
is
a
pretty
good
summer
beer
it
misses
a
little
on
the
crispness
of
the
hopping
and
is
onedimensional
in
the
malt
department
still
all
in
all
this
is
a
pretty
solid
helles
and
nothing
wrong
with
it
at
all
i
just
wish
it
brought
a
bit
more
malt
flavor
and
crispness
overall
a
pleasant
and
easy
drinking
summer
beer
overall
this
is
a
refreshing
beer
but
i
wouldnt
purchase
it
again
im
not
a
huge
fan
of
the
style
but
prefer
german
versions
to
this
rjt
this
beer
has
very
little
taste
and
is
practically
carbonated
water
although
its
perfect
on
a
hot
summer
day
because
its
so
refreshing
and
easy
to
drink
the
problem
is
that
its
barely
beer
the
macros
have
more
flavor
thanks
linda
bottle

crisp

a

from

the
finish
reminded
me
a
little
bit
of
a
pilsner
but
the
hops
dont
linger
as
long
would
buy
it
again
i
think
this
is
the
first
helles
i
tried
so
i
dont
have
much
to
compare
with
this
is
just
an
awesome
beer
and
a
fantastic
example
of
the
style
it
takes
some
exceptional
skill
to
brew
a
beer
so
delicate
without
any
obvious
flaws
ive
been
buying
6
packs
of
this
throughout
the
summer
and
just
keep
going
back
to
it
highly
recommended

abv
the
verdict
its
ok
slightly
above
average
maybe
thanks
to
the
lemon
zest
but
not
much
more
than
that
rather
bland
and
lightweight
those
who
prefer
something
on
the
light
side
may
actually
prefer
it
this
is
exactly
what
i
was
looking
for
the
look
is
unimportant
is
corny
new
belgium
yeast
this
is
a
light
crisp
watery
lager
with
just
the
right
amount
of
corn
and
sweet
malt
hops
are
a
bit
flat
and
medicinal
otherwise
this
is
great
a
very
well
done
helles
lager
crisp
easy
drinking
tasty
beer
oexcellent
summer
beer
lacks
the
depth
and
complexity
of
some
in
this
style
but
a
great
drinker
for
the
summer
taste
clean
light
refreshing
good
for
a
summer
thirst
quencher
beer
lager
so
true
to
its
origin
which
positively
effected
these
rateing
overall
this
is
a
really
nice
beer
for
summer
not
the
best
example
of
the
style
out
there
but
it
is

im
a
fan
of
the

pale

and
tasty

i
could
use
a

more
hops
but
there
are
some
nice
herbal

characteristics
going
on
overall
what
a
refreshing
summer
helles
should
definitely
deliver
a
thirst
quenching
characteristic
lawnmower
style
beer
overall
a
decent
refreshing
beer
for
a
hot
summer
day
but
nothing
to
go
out
of
your
way
for
its
an
excellent
beer
im
always
hoping
for
more
lighter
brews
that
provide
some
flavor
this
one
is
more
subtle
and
adds
a
different
twist
to
the
summer
beer
lineup
while
this
isnt
one
of
my
favorites
its
yet
another
utterly
clean
and
wellengineered
beer
from
new
belgium
from
the
12
oz
bottle
purchased
at
trader
joes
enjoyable
nice
for
a
warm
day
overall
new
belgium
is
03
in
my
book
i
was
expecting
this
to
be
like
a
hofbrau
or
weinhenstephaner
why
copy
a
heineken
as
a
seasonal
to
boot
heines
available
year
around
and
for
cheaper
the
best
thing
about
this
is
the
brown
bottle
pretty
much
guaranteed
a
non
skunked
heineken
overall
a
pretty
solid
light
summer
pale
lager
good
grainy
malt
notes
with
a
nice
bitter
backing
of
hops
o
fairly
refreshing
easy
to
drink
offering
that
is
fairly
nondescript
a
good
summer
beer
for
a
hot
day
nonreview
rant
nb
used
to
make
some
really
interesting
summer
beers
in
the
late
90s
they
had
their
nicelyhopped
low
alcohol
actual
belgianstyled
porch
swing
single
then
there
was
their
delicious
loft
with
wheat
and
coriander
and
kaffir
leaf
the
recipe
was
tweaked
into
skinny
dip
which
was
still
good
but
the
last
5
years
they
have
declined
very
sharply
in
interest
overall
i
didnt
think
the
malts
held
this
up
enough
it
felt
too
sharp
and
carbonated
at
times
watery
o
overall
it
is
quite
a
tasty
beer
although
i
wish
it
had
just
a
little
more
character
my
initial
thought
was
that
nb
finally
managed
to
brew
a
beer
bud
would
be
proud
of
on
second
thought
though
i
think
it
is
a
good
summer
brew
and
might
bring
in
some
people
who
would
normally
pass
on
the
micro
market
overall
not
a
great
lager
overall
refreshing
yes
complex
not
so
much
it
would
be
a
nice
session
beer
for
the
summer
but
the
complexities
just
are
not
there
very
little
from
the
hops
just
not
a
very
interesting
beer
here
and
nothing
like
the
helles
beers
of
europe
this
is
impossibly
light
in
both
color
and
flavor
definitely
taking
on
a
watered
down
vibe
but
being
refreshing
enough
and
certainly
sessionable
enough
if
you
can
keep
from
getting
bored
by
it
pale
pale
yellow
in
color
but
holds
a
decent
inch
of
white
fluff
on
top
as
the
bubbles
run
to
the
surface
the
nose
is
a
little
sweet
and
then
full
of
pilsener
and
pale
malts
but
ithe
malty
nose
doesnt
carry
to
the
flavor
where
the
front
end
of
this
is
almost
entirely
tasteless
more
excitement
in
the
finish
as
the
grains
are
pretty
fresh
tasting
and
some
simple
but
well
timed
hops
enter
the
equation
its
very
drinkable
stuff
but
rather
devoid
of
flavor
and
falls
into
that
low
medium
level
so
many
of
these
new
belgium
seasonals
have
fallen
to
zero
body
and
a
lot
of
bubbles
is
nice
for
warm
weather
but
i
need
my
beer
to
taste
like
beer
and
this
barely
gets
there
for
me
o
refreshing
and
easy
to
drink
with
a
light
flavor
and
body
which
makes
it
great
for
the
hot
summer
weather
matches
well
with
the
turkey
hot
dogs
and
baked
beans
im
having
for
dinner
tonight
overall
nb
knocked
this
one
out
of
the
park
its
so
easy
to
knock
these
back
great
brew
a
solid
offering
any
time
of
the
year
as
far
as
i
can
see
but
perfect
for
a
hot
summer
day
overall
pick
this
beer
up
and
enjoy
it
already
a
basic
wellmade
refreshing
helles
an
enjoyable
session
brew
the
summer
helles
from
new
belgium
is
a
great
offering
the
beer
poured
a
pure
clear
yellow
with
white
head
that
is
lacing
down
the
entire
glass
the
scent
carries
mostly
graining
hops
the
taste
is
close
to
a
pilsner
light
and
crisp
with
grass
and
grain
flare
the
mouthfeel
is
lighter
in
body
with
good
carbonation
overall
this
is
a
nice
summer
session
ale
o
this
lager
is
easydrinking
and
refreshing
when
cold
but
thats
about
it
not
that
i
was
expecting
this
beer
as
new
as
it
is
to
be
all
that
good
after
all
which
american
craft
beer
brewer
has
the
guts
to
attempt
brewing
a
decent
helles
one
of
the
most
difficult
styles
to
get
right
nice
try
nb
but
i
have
to
say
this
one
is
a
dud
i
suppose
im
still
looking
for
that
holy
grail
a
great
domestically
brewed
american
helles
that
mimics
the
great
helles
lagers
of
sw
germany
overall
an
ok
beer
something
for
a
hot
day
the
taste
follows
suit
with
an
odd
lemony
aspect
that
is
out
of
place
here
and
the
malt
is
nearly
as
light
as
an
adjunct
lager
it
does
have
a
smooth
mouthfeel
with
a
crisp
snap
at
the
end
overall
im
pretty
disappointed
in
this
one
as
it
tastes
closer
to
an
aal
than
a
good
traditional
german
helles
this
feels
rushed
and
just
not
a
well
thought
out
beer
it
sure
is
smooth
and
tasty
enough
for
me
to
enjoy
i
like
my
beer
guru
have
me
a
couple
of
these
to
try
but
did
not
give
it
a
ringing
endorsement
i
can
see
why
nothing
special
here
but
secondly
not
bad
either
not
much
to
look
at
and
no
smell
of
note
but
tasty
beer
although
not
that
interesting
overall
i
enjoyed
it
glad
he
gave
me
two
good
beer
for
a
quantity
over
quality
night
but
certainly
not
a
beer
i
would
go
out
of
my
way
to
have
flat
and
doughy
for
a
lager
this
is
quite
lackluster
rather
fresh
yet
still
has
a
dms
tinge
the
other
new
belgium
summer
seasonals
have
been
much
more
consistent
come
on
guys
i
know
you
can
do
better
summer
helles
pours
a
clear
golden
color
with
a
small
but
lacing
head
there
is
a
stench
similar
to
smelly
garbage
and
skunks
the
taste
is
light
has
strong
soap
flavors
but
just
hints
of
a
nice
crisp
malt
flavor
light
watery
and
borderline
offensive
overall
it
has
hints
of
a
nice
flavor
but
a
lot
of
garbage
mixed
it
a
decent
offering
from
new
begium
just
in
time
for
the
summer
this
brew
is
overall
is
spectacular
but
certainly
pretty
good
and
very
sessionable
what
i
wasnt
overly
wowed
with
were
its
appearance
standard
golden
beer
color
and
its
taste
just
slightly
better
than
your
runofthemill
lager
i
did
find
its
strong
yeasty
smell
very
appealing
reminding
me
of
the
good
olbig
fat
yeast
roll
and
it
was
one
of
the
smoothest
beers
ive
had
in
a
while
so
not
the
best
ive
had
from
new
belgium
but
certainly
good
enough
to
go
out
and
partake
of
some
more
pours
out
a
pale
gold
with
a
light
haze
a
good
deal
of
bubbles
in
the
body
thin
white
head
smell
is
too
grainy
for
me
to
be
calling
it
a
helles
lager
i
expect
to
smell
more
breadiness
and
honey
flavor
works
out
a
lot
better
way
maltier
than
the
smell
would
have
you
believe
there
is
a
grainy
character
to
it
but
it
isnt
too
overbearing
i
only
knock
it
for
the
slight
nb
house
taste
which
throws
me
off
mouthfeel
is
prickly
spritzy
and
lightbodied
overall
i
like
this
but
its
not
the
best
lager
out
there
respect
overall
i
thought
this
was
a
decent
beer
and
a
nice
example
of
the
style
it
had
most
of
the
aspects
that
i
look
for
in
the
style
but
i
think
a
little
less
sweetness
and
a
little
bit
more
hop
flavor
would
help
this
beer
out
and
make
it
stand
out
a
little
this
beer
had
nice
drinkability
it
was
smooth
crisp
clean
not
filling
but
the
taste
didnt
do
the
best
job
at
holding
my
attention
i
think
two
would
be
my
limit
i
might
get
bored
with
it
after
that
what
i
like
the
most
about
this
beer
was
the
how
true
to
style
it
was
it
had
most
of
the
aspects
that
i
expect
from
the
style
what
i
like
the
least
about
this
beer
was
the
it
was
a
little
bland
i
know
this
style
doesnt
have
the
most
flavor
but
this
one
seemed
a
little
blander
then
some
of
the
better
helles
lagers
i
wouldnt
buy
this
beer
again
theres
a
few
other
sessionable
lager
that
i
would
rather
have
i
dont
know
if
i
recommend
it
but
if
you
wanted
an
easy
drinking
beer
i
would
say
give
it
a
shot
all
in
all
i
thought
this
was
decent
beer
there
wasnt
anything
off
or
wrong
with
it
and
the
it
seemed
to
be
pretty
true
to
style
so
in
my
eyes
this
is
a
fairly
solid
example
of
the
style
thanks
for
another
solid
easy
drinking
beer
new
belgium
pours
a
clear
light
yellow
with
a
foamy
white
head
that
settles
to
a
partial
film
on
top
of
the
beer
small
streaks
of
lace
form
around
the
glass
on
the
drink
down
smell
is
of
malt
grain
hay
and
grass
aromas
taste
is
much
the
same
with
grain
and
grass
flavors
on
the
finish
there
is
a
mild
amount
of
hop
bitterness
on
the
palate
with
each
sip
this
beer
has
a
lower
level
of
carbonation
with
a
slightly
crisp
mouthfeel
overall
this
is
a
pretty
good
beer
that
is
fairly
refreshing
and
easy
to
drink
o
overall
this
beer
could
benefit
with
some
bigger
malted
barley
character
its
certainly
light
and
refreshing
but
its
not
comparable
to
the
better
imports
taste
is
similar
with
sweet
malts
coming
in
prior
to
a
touch
of
dry
hops
simply
a
solid
helles
lager
and
an
enjoyable
light
brew
for
warm
weather
feels
strange
with
a
dry
mealy
aftertaste
overall
not
a
good
experience
might
try
on
tap
but
will
likely
avoid
the
bottles
in
the
future
bottle
of
long
fin
drank
i
feel
like
i
have
had
this
before
but
i
suppose
it
would
have
been
a
long
time
ago
rather
happy
about
ballast
point
switching
over
to
a
lot
of
canned
offerings
pale
as
it
gets
with
pils
malts
and
lager
yeast
in
the
drivers
seat
tasted
from
a
12
ounce
bottle
on
march
29
2015
the
longfin
was
an
easy
drinking
lager
would
be
great
for
warmer
weather
days
it
poured
a
clear
golden
with
fizzywhite
head
that
did
not
lace
the
scent
and
taste
were
mostly
grains
mouthfeel
was
lighter
in
body
with
great
carbonation
overall
it
was
good
fruity
and
spicy
with
a
decent
maltiness
for
a
lager
hops
are
there
but
way
in
the
background
will
be
great
when
the
weather
heats
up
bready
no
real
aroma
a
decent
representation
of
the
style
a
completely
average
lager
not
bad
and
i
would
drink
it
again
gladly
but
nothing
memorable
either
for
a
socal
lager
golden
roads
329
is
much
better
as
for
ballast
point
their
kölsch
pale
ale
and
their
witbier
wahoo
are
much
better
if
youre
looking
for
something
light
and
refreshing
this
is
the
first
beer
of
theirs
that
i
didnt
admire
042713
at
beer
authority
nyc
just
a
taste
looking
for
something
crisp
refreshing
this
was
not
it
a
bit
too
much
linger
lacked
crispness
worth
another
look
in
a
different
mode
overall
a
lager
that
is
bursting
with
flavor
one
of
my
all
time
favorite
lagers
extremely
easy
drinking
highly
agreeable
to
any
beer
drinker
even
those
who
must
have
the
macros
great
session
beer
with
mass
appeal
even
the
wife
enjoyed
it
o
well
done
lager
true
to
the
style
and
a
treat
to
drink
the
only
caveat
is
the
price
which
is
a
little
more
than
one
would
expect
overall
ballast
point
nailed
this
pretty
well
would
love
to
try
one
that
is
fresh
o
had
high
hopes
for
longfin
but
found
it
good
though
hardly
great
i
appreciate
everything
about
this
lager
including
its
low
abv
it
all
says
quality
but
nothing
was
found
truly
exceptional
a
good
brew
but
stupid
expensive
at
126
ive
likely
had
my
last
b
p
longfin
light
crisp
above
average
carbonation
my
rating
gives
the
brewer
the
benefit
of
the
doubt
absent
mishandling
by
either
a
retailer
or
distributor
this
beer
coulda
been
a
contender
d
this
is
a
nice
refreshing
and
crisp
helles
with
solid
balance
but
its
a
bit
of
your
typical
standard
fare
simple
and
straightforward
albeit
still
better
than
the

a

in

of
the

some
lovely
hellesstyle
goodness
trickling
through

the
body
straddles
the
line
between
hefty
light
and
light
medium
with
a
light
moderate
carbonation
and
a
fluid
feel
overall
a
very
solid
and
highly
drinkable
little
lager
something
we
need
more
of
round
here
overall
a
good
representation
of
the
style
and
a
great
beer
to
drink
during
a
hot
san
diego
summer
day
this
could
be
an
excellent
goto
for
sessioning
and
is
also
an
excellent
beer
to
introduce
those
not
used
to
craft
to
o
refreshing
easy
to
drink
and
enjoyable
this
might
be
my
new
go
to
grilling
beer
will
be
great
in
the
hot
nc
summer
o
pretty
decent
very
grain
dominant
in
the
flavor
department
smells
spot
on
for
helles
though
mouthfeel
is
slightly
too
full
and
it
is
somewhat
undercarbonated
poor
by
ballast
points
standards
again
like
the
nose
ballast
point
put
some
thought
into
brewing
this
to
emulate
the
german
style
beer
the
sweet
biscuit
malts
are
formidable
as
are
the
herbs
and
mildly
hopped
finish
this
is
a
good
truetostyle
lager
overall
an
easy
drinking
lager
with
just
enough
flavor
to
put
aals
to
shame
nice
beer
aroma
is
rather
bothersome
since
it
contains
quite
a
bit
of
corn
and
adjunct
aroma
as
does
the
malt
base
in
the
flavor
however
hops
are
a
redeeming
quality
and
the
spice
notes
in
the
flavor
add
crispness
and
match
the
helles
lager
profile
very
well
not
my
favorite
lager
style
but
this
fits
the
bill
overall
a
decent
take
on
a
euro
style
lager
good
bready
and
citrusy
taste
overall
picked
up
a
single
to
try
another
one
from
ballast
point
who
recently
entered
the
minnesota
market
longfin
is
a
solid
easy
drinking
lager
nice
and
balanced
flavor
good
one
for
a
hot
day
or
if
you
want
something
easy
to
drink
very

ive
had

it

i
wont
buy
it
again
overall
decent
lager
better
than
most
macros
but
not
by
much
onice
lager
wheat
style
brew
easy
to
drink
with
enough
taste
very
clean
and
smooth
would
be
a
good
summer
beer
but
ive
have
plenty
of
better
lagers
o
very
good
lager
and
has
a
lot
going
on
for
the

not
anything
earth
shattering
but
not
looking
for
that
todayjust
lookin
for
an
after
work
patio
beer
o
very
good
example
of
the
style
id
pick
this
up
again
if
the
price
is
right
easy
to
drink
good
flavors
well
done
t
so
disappointed
in
this
taste
it
tastes
like
high
end
budweiser
just
as
it
smelled
crisp
light
refreshing
sure
but
boring
not
bad
just
boring
i
keep
looking
for
anything
to
make
it
unique
or
special
but
nothing
so
luckily
tonight
im
taking
home
one
of
their
new
cans
of
the
longfin
hopefully
i
am
proven
wrong
and
my
sample
was
just
old
i
promise
to
rereview
this
beer
because
i
love
the
brewery
so
much
they
definitely
need
another
shot
thanks
to
woodychandler
for
yet
another
canned
beer
poured
from
a
12
oz
can
has
a
yellow
color
with
a
1
inch
head
smell
is
mild
some
malts
a
touch
of
sweetness
to
it
taste
is
light
and
mild
malts
a
bit
of
hops
at
the
finish
not
exactly
bursting
with
flavor
feels
light
in
the
mouth
and
overall
is
a
mediocre
beer
okay
cuz
come
wid
it
the
crack
revealed
yet
another
brimful
craft
can
and
i
hope
that
the
big
boys
are
paying
attention
because
this
is
how
to
make
the
cansumer
feel
like
they
have
gotten
their
moneys
worth
an
inverted
glug
later
and
we
were
off
and
running
i
briefly
had
a
finger
of
fizzy
foamy
bonewhite
head
that
quickly
dissipated
into
wisps
leaving
just
a
skim
across
the
top
in
its
wake
color
was
a
pale
strawyellow
with
nequality
clarity
and
i
once
again
want
to
mention
the
plight
of
lincoln
nes
own
val
midwest
who
has
been
cited
for
public
nudity
while
trespassing
on
private
property
ha
she
may
beat
this
one
and
i
will
stop
there
say
a
fizzy
yellow
beer
from
san
diego
county
california
doesnt
someone
else
from
the
area
have
some
choice
words
to
say
about
such
things
nose
is
good
with
a
pure
lager
scent
driven
by
a
honeylike
sweetness
with
an
underlying
grassiness
undoubtedly
from
saaz
hops
i
say
pure
because
one
of
the
drawbacks
of
the
canquest
tm
has
been
my
repeated
exposure
to
aals
and
once
i
realized
what
a
lager
was
supposed
to
taste
like
and
what
prohibition
desensitized
us
into
i
wept
and
cantinue
to
weep
mouthfeel
was
medium
not
overly
carbonated
as
i
may
have
led
people
to
believe
with
my
fizzy
comment
the
taste
was
more
grassy
than
malty
which
straddles
a
fine
line
between
a
german
and
a
czech
but
as
the
sites
description
reads
a
bit
more
subdued
and
in
balance
with
malts

aside
from
the
feel
but
not
very
malty
either
drinkable
but
even
less
interesting
than
many
industrial
lagers
a
slight

is
about
the
best
i
can
say
for

of
traditional
ingredients
and

body
and
hangs
on
the
tongue
enough
to
keep
the
malt
and
sweet
around
a
while
nice
decent
lager
but
nothing
to
write
home
about
overall
i
thought
this
was
a
nice
beer
and
its
an
above
average
example
of
the
style
the
malts
were
very
bready
and
it
had
the
signature
spicy
hops
but
i
think
they
were
just
a
little
light
for
the
style
this
beer
had
good
drinkability
it
was
pretty
smooth
clean
not
filling
and
the
flavors
did
a
decent
job
at
holding
my
attention
i
wouldnt
have
a
problem
drinking
a
few
of
these
and
it
makes
for
a
nice
beer
to
enjoy
on
those
hot
summer
afternoons
what
i
liked
the
most
about
this
beer
was
the
appearance
and
mouthfeel
they
were
both
pretty
nice
what
i
liked
the
least
about
this
beer
was
the
balance
i
feel
like
a
little
more
spicy
hops
would
help
make
this
truer
to
style
and
balance
out
all
those
bready
malts
i
would
order
a
pint
or
two
of
this
at
a
bar
but
i
dont
think
i
would
get
a
six
pack
of
it
and
i
recommend
to
anyone
who
likes
easy
drinking
lagers
all
in
all
i
enjoyed
this
beer
it
was
a
nice
easy
drinking
lager
but
hofbräu
original
is
still
my
favorite
of
the
style
i
think
its
more
balanced
than
this
beer
and
it
does
a
better
job
at
showcasing
those
spicy
hop
flavors
this
made
for
a
decent
first
impression
for
rivertown
and
im
interested
in
checking
out
more
of
their
beers
thanks
a
lot
adam
o
this
style
isnt
gonna
wow
anyone
but
hits
the
spot
and
is
worth
a
try
cheers
while
not
as
hoppy
and
dry
as
im
used
to
for
germanstyle
lagers
e
g
pilsners
this
was
a
nice
break
rivertown
makes
very
solid
attempts
at
traditional
european
styles
and
the
helles
is
no
exception
id
rather
have
a
pilsner
though
but
a
refreshing
maltforward
brew
overall
overall
really
delicious
helles
lager
slightly
sweet
with
a
underlying
noble
hop
bitternessspiciness
very
clean
crisp
and
refreshing
beer
however
with
a
bit
too
high
carbonation
for
my
taste
true
germanpils
malts
are
prominently
displayed
overall
its
much
better
than
i
expected
more
abv
would
be
a
nice
addition
but
i
didnt
hate
this
and
thats
praise
coming
from
me
this
is
a
pretty
good
helles
unfortunately
the
carbonation
is
so
high
that
it
really
does
interfere
with
the
flavor
delivery
what
i
do
get
is
a
nice
grainy
lager
with
a
consistent
flavor
profile
though
a
bit
metallic
and
tangy
but
its
passable
call
it
a
kellerbier
or
a
bohemian
lager
and
im
going
to
buy
that
much
better
than
a
helles
but
even
then
the
heightened
taste
and
texture
of
corn
and
bitter
prove
too
much
for
any
lager
beer
mouthfeel
the
body
of
the
beer
is
well
balanced
and
middle
of
the
road
but
i
cant
get
past
the
carbonation
it
is
just
too
much
i
dont
know
how
but
it
feels
like
my
mouth
has
turned
to
a
smoldering
ember
after
each
drink
wtf
overall
decent
beer
it
seems
a
little
watered
down
but
has
a
nice
overall
flavor
i
had
a
really
hard
time
pouring
this
beer
there
was
a
lot
of
carbonation
i
would
like
to
try
again
o
very
enjoyable
beer
reminiscent
of
hefe
and
pilsner
characteristics
easy
to
drink
o
overall
quite
nice
something
that
is
crisp
and
easy
drinking
i
would
certainly
choose
this
of
the
plethora
of
other
lager
options
which
flood
our
markets
these
days
o
not
perfect
but
its
a
decent
pale
lager
some
funny
stuff
in
the
nose
could
be
cleared
up

ounce

bought
for

served
in
a
pilsener
glass
the
beer
pours
a
slightly
hazy
light
gold
color
with
about
a
half
inch
white
head
the
head
retention
is
good
but
there
isnt
much
lacing
left
on
the
glass
the
aroma
is
a
little
light
overall
the
brew
smells
like
bready
malt
sweet
malt
and
a
bit
of
grassy
hops
it
mostly
tastes
like
grainbready
malt
along
with
some
light
grassy
hops
and
lemon
peel
mouthfeelbody
is
lightmedium
its
nice
and
crisp
with
good
carbonation
its
also
easy
to
drink
i
think
its
a
solid
overall
brew
its
nice
and
enjoyable
to
drink
and
definitely
worth
trying
this
one
pours
a
very
light
and
moderately
clear
faint
gold
in
color
with
a
light
white
lacing
around
the
glass
when
it
first
poured
it
even
resembled
a
chardonnay
it
eventually
gained
a
light
cloudiness
it
smells
of
pilsner
malt
with
a
light
sweet
malty
finish
its
moderately
grainy
upon
my
first
whiff
i
even
thought
i
got
some
ever
so
light
white
grape
interesting
and
light
it
drinks
very
clean
and
light
and
has
moderate
carbonation
overall
this
one
is
okay
and
i
like
when
american
breweries
cover
this
style
but
this
one
doesnt
separate
itself
from
the
others
a
very
pleasant
helles
crisp
bright
malt
body
with
a
bit
of
toasted
biscuit
in
the
malt
a
touch
of
grassyness
with
hints
of
lemon
easygoing
character
makes
for
a
good
session
candidate
id
like
to
see
this
brewery
get
a
bit
wider
distribution
what
an
excellent
way
to
end
a
rather
long
work
week
during
an
especially
hot
summer
this
is
an
ideal
quaff
i
finished
this
in
no
time
and
found
myself
reaching
for
another
on
tap
at
bodega
in
columbus
4
50
per
pint
clear
pale
golden
color
about
a
cm
of
foam
that
sinks
to
a
filmy
layer
bready
aroma
neutral
and
a
little
grainy
very
little
impact
from
hops
appropriately
nice
flavor
nothing
offputting
at
all
just
a
solid
and
unassuming
helles
lager
good
carbonation
and
body
no
real
complaints
with
this
beer
quality
helles
lager
in
true
bavarian
fashion
as
opposed
to
a
mediocre
american
imitation
ill
be
seeking
more
offerings
from
this
small
local
brewery
o
overall
a
very
easy
drinking
beer
that
was
a
touch
boring
but
still
solid
its
sweet
almost
too
sweet
for
my
taste
i
cant
drink
more
than
a
couple
of
bottles
of
this
lager
it
seriously
needs
a
hops
infusion
it
may
be
ok
for
some
traditional
bavarian
foods
such
as
a
pretzel
with
mustard
but
its
just
too
sweet
for
my
taste
ill
probably
not
get
it
again
just
enough
creamy
mouthfeel
to
let
you
know
it
is
there
but
not
enough
to
keep
one
from
gulping
if
they
want
easy
on
the
chops
this
is
decidedly
a
session
beer
dream
incredibly
easy
to
drain
without
thought
but
enough
to
discuss
in
case
any
thought
is
given
d
its
damn
hot
in
my
house
tonight
and
this
is
cool
and
refreshing
perfect
brew
when
its
hot
outside
d
due
to
the
great
taste
and
easy
going
body
of
this
beer
this
is
definitely
session
worthy
d
clean
lager
and
somehow
refreshing
not
really
hitting
my
spot
as
a
helles
had
one
and
switched
to
a
wheat
not
very
drinkable
in
mass
this
is
very
drinkable
i
enjoyed
this
very
balanced
although
could
use
a
bit
more
dominating
flavors
this
would
be
a
wonderful
summer
beer
mouthfeel
drinkability
the
body
of
the
beer
is
light
but
not
watery
the
flavors
and
aromas
are
clean
the
carbonation
works
well
with
the
beers
overall
character
this
is
a
nice
throw
back
beer
d
very
clean
and
refreshing
would
go
well
on
a
hot
day
paired
great
with
my
shrimp
asparagus
salad
drinkability
a
nicely
done
helles
ought
to
hold
its
own
come
warmer
climes
and
should
taste
just
as
good
if
the
cincinnati
heat
gets
to
it
a
bit
though
mine
is
steadily
disappearing
malty
and
a
little
cloying
on
the
finish
there
i
expected
a
stronger
hop
note
something
about
it
was
syrupy
a
great
looking
beer
so
smooth
and
easy
to
drink
served
in
a
willibecker
at
the
lodge
pours
a
goldenorange
hue
with
a
slightly
hazy
clarity
and
a
loose
bright
white
head
nose
expresses
light
fruity
esters
a
slightly
grassy
quality
and
a
hint
of
sour
mash
taste
follows
nose
with
the
addition
of
a
light
biscuit
malts
a
hint
of
sweetness
and
a
faint
lingering
sour
mash
character
towards
the
back
mouthfeel
is
light
in
body
with
a
pleasant
even
carbonation
and
a
clean
mostly
crisp
finish
overall
a
solid
domestic
helles
on
par
with
those
ive
had
in
germany
however
id
like
to
see
more
of
a
clean
finish
i
had
two
glasses
while
dining
at
the
green
mountain
inn
went
well
with
both
meals
one
light
and
one
being
a
heavier
meal
very
refreshing
and
sessionable
the
best
beer
i
had
at
trapp
probably
the
best
helles
ive
had
overall
a
very
drinkable
helles
lager
that
you
can
definetly
session
o
light
and
refreshing
enough
for
the
style
but
the
flavor
is
very
similar
to
any
nuimber
of
better
mainstream
lagers
osolid
lager
beer
easy
drinking
and
enjoyable
refreshing
and
drinkable
overall
i
was
hoping
for
some
vt
magic
in
this
but
its
just
another
mediocre
american
lager
tap
poured
a
deep
golden
color
helles
with
a
small
foamy
head
with
good
retention
and
some
lacing
aroma
of
clean
cereal
notes
with
light
floral
aroma
taste
is
also
dominated
by
light
floral
aromas
with
some
clean
cereal
notes
a
medium
sweet
finish
body
is
about
average
for
style
with
medium
carbonation
refreshing
and
well
brewed
for
style
overall
solid
lager
would
definitely
put
these

this
is
a
craft
that
you
can
bring
to
a
party
overall
a
real
light
brew
full
of
flavor
great
beer
to
have
on
the
deck
rich
malty
and
spicy
aroma
full
complex
taste
on
a
light
lager
it
is
amazing
how
much
flavor
can
be
piled
on
such
a
light
frame
crisp
and
refreshing
with
a
dry
finish
a
great
example
of
the
helles
style
this
beer
was
good
enough
to
have
a
few
of
im
looking
forward
to
trying
more
trapp
beers
on
future
trips
and
maybe
even
visiting
the
brewery
had
a
pint
at
the
farm
house
in
burlington
vt
damn
its
hard
to
ask
for
much
more
from
a
helles
theres
a
crisp
dry
brady
malt
character
in
the
aroma
with
a
little
balance
of
spicy
hops
theres
mild
lager
fruit
over
the
malt
but
its
not
sweet
otherwise
its
clean
and
super
drinkable
find
this
beer
o
goes
down
easy
tasty
not
filling
mild
kick
a
very
good
representation
of
the
style
overall
really
nice
great
lagers
tons
of
cracked
straw
and
toasty
pils
like
malts
nice
fruity
lager
clean
crisp
finish
with
nice
hops
overall
overall
a
top
notch
lager
and
a
super
drinkable
treat
taste
is
classic
full
of
quality
malt
and
mildly
bitter
this
is
what
the
aals
aspire
to
be
like
a
bud
made
with
care
and
quality
ingredients
crisply
dry
finish
with
vaguely
lingering
bitterness
a
nice
example
of
what
is
to
me
a
nonetoointeresting
style
not
the
hugest
fan
of
this
kind
of
beer
but
its
clearly
done
very
well
this
is
my
second
trapp
beer
tasted
and
i
continue
to
be
overwhelmed
i
told
my
daughter
to
bring
as
much
of
this
home
from
vermont
as
she
could
and
she
was
kind
enought
to
do
so
this
beer
comes
in
a
big
flippy
bottle
this
is
as
rich
and
luscious
a
helles
as
ive
ever
had
which
is
plenty
a
nice
hazy
gold
in
the
glass
the
bottlepoured
head
fluffed
right
up
decent
lacing
followed
the
beer
down
all
the
way
wonderfull
malts
with
just
the
right
hop
balance
create
a
great
smooth
taste
the
sweetness
is
in
there
but
just
enough
the
conditioning
is
light
which
adds
to
the
silky
mouthfeel
this
is
a
great
beer
pours
a
deep
golden
color
with
a
huge
rich
off
white
head
that
sticks
around
forever
smells
of
grainy
bready
malts
with
rich
melanoids
mixed
in
earthy
floral
hops
are
more
aggressive
than
i
would
have
thought
taste
is
sweet
grainy
toasty
bready
malts
with
hints
of
honey
burnt
sugar
and
an
earthy
hop
bitterness
that
threw
me
at
first
finish
leaves
a
sweetness
with
an
earthy
hop
bitterness
medium
body
with
crisp
carbonation
and
a
sweet
almost
sticky
mouthfeel
great
lager
that
im
glad
i
tried
on
a
whim
on
tap
pours
a
translucent
straw

with
a
12
inch

good
amount
of

very
crisp
and
refreshing
slightly
buttery
nice
sweet
malty
flavor
overall
its
nothing
over
the
top
but
its
a
solid
beer
worth
having
again
highly
drinkable
and
very
satisfying
poured
into
a
massive
imperial

golden
with
a
slight
haze
and
a
big
foamy
white
head
that
has
a
decent

malts

helles
is
one
of
my
favorite
german
styles
and
this
does
not
disappoint
i
think
this
is
one
of
the
best
american
takes
on
the
style
and
i
would
gladly
order
this
whenever
i
can
a
very
drinkable
beer
well
done
this
is
a
very
tasty
beer
with
great
drinkablity
very
tough
to
get
the
spicy
hop
zip
in
a
beer
as
gently
malted
and
hopped
as
this
well
done
off
tap
at
the
brewery
this
beer
was
a
perfectly
clear
golden
color
with
one
finger
of
frothy
white
head
the
retention
of
the
cap
was
average
but
the
collar
did
last
quite
a
while
and
the
lacing
was
scattered
and
streaky
the
aroma
was
nice
and
dry
crystal
malt
vienna
malt
lager
yeast
grains
and
a
slight
boozy
note
the
flavors
were
very
dry
and
clearly
grainy
most
the
viennacrystal
again
with
hints
of
toasted
malt
and
a
little
mustiness
as
it
warmed
up
much
like
a
pilsner
i
found
it
to
be
crisp
and
refreshing
the
mouthfeel
was
creamy
the
body
mediumlight
and
the
carbonation
perfect
a
great
new
local
example
that
is
more
than
appropriate
for
this
setting
tate
is
phenomenal
its
light
ad
crisp
and
super
hoppy
its
very
drinkable

and
havent
looked

memories
great
beer
germany
still
rules
if
this
is
a
lager
than
this
is
one
of
the
best
representations
of
it
just
about
the
very
definition
of
that
classic

i
am
not

of
this

so
consider
the
source
o
i
feel
like
i
know
weihenstephaner
mostly
for
the
hefeweissbier
and
the
weisse
variants
but
this
is
one
of
the
better
golden

ive
ever
had
something
to
satisfy
the
beer

and
the
massmarket

consumer
the
quintessential

its

and
one
ill
definitely
revisit
as
a
palatecleanser
when
taking
a
break
from
the
hops
o
the
sulfur
detracted
from
the
experience
oi
a
world
class
beer
and
one
of
the
beers
that
sets
the
standard
for
the
style
a
must
try
at
the
brewery
or
in

didnt
give
it
a

possibly
the
best
lager
period
there
are
no

in
this
brew
the
epitome
of
reheitsgabot
production
the
rest
a
crisp
slightly
grainy
euro
lager
very
good
overall
i
thought
this
was
a
good
beer
and
good
example
of
the
style
it
had
everything
that
i
look
for
in
a
german
made
lager
and
there
wasnt
any
aspects
that
felt
out
of
place
this
beer
had
good
drinkability
it
was
smooth
clean
crisp
slightly
prickly
not
filling
at
all
and
the
taste
did
a
nice
job
of
holding
my
attention
i
could
drink
more
than
a
few
of
these
without
getting
tired
of
it
what
i
like
the
most
about
this
beer
was
how
true
to
style
it
was
it
had
everything
that
i
expect
from
a
good
german
made
lager
what
i
like
the
least
about
this
beer
is
nothing
there
isnt
anything
that
i
disliked
or
would
change
its
good
just
the
way
it
is
i
would
buy
this
beer
again
when
in
the
mood
for
the
style
and
i
would
recommend
it
to
anybody
that
enjoys
a
good
lager
all
in
all
i
was
happy
with
this
beerit
was
just
a
well
crafted
lager
and
i
enjoyed
it
this
is
up
there
as
one
of
the
better
beers
ive
had
from
this
brewery
and
i
think
its
now
my
favorite
german
made
lager
good
job
guys
this
was
one
good
lager
keep
up
the
hard
work
o
this
brewery
consistently
puts
out
world
class
beer
and
their
original
is
no
exception
o
what
i
presume
to
be
exemplary
of
the
style
rounded
off
by
my
lack
of
familiarity
thereof
presents
as
an
easydrinkin
beer
sessionable
and
light
with
a
stable
of
core
flavor
elements
o
easy
drinking
i
have
to
ask
myself
self
why
havent
you
had
this
before
o
a
good
helles
enjoy
cheers
overall
this
beer
is
lovely
all
parts
work
well
together
o
refreshing
and
super
easy
to
drink
very
enjoyable
and
a
great
example
of
the
style
definitely
worth
getting
and
i
plan
on
getting
it
again
soon
its
good
for
the
summer
o
great
example
of
the
style
very
enjoyable
beer
perfect
for
this
near
95
degree
day
o
truly
a
delicious
beer
a
standard
for
this
style
and
the
best
ive
yet
found
it
in
got
this
at
greenville
scs
whole
foods
market
today
drank
in
walterboro
sc
this
everything
one
could
ask
for
in
a
lager
beer
and
i
give
it
high
marks
i
think
i
paid
only
about
4something
for
the
half
liter
which
aint
too
bad
considering
it
came
halfway
around
the
world
from
here
its
good
to
see
more
variety
in
my
town
butte
montana
purchased
at
the
hennessey
i
expected
this
to
be
just
a
bit
behind
the
favorites
of
this
brewery
korbinian
vitus
hefe
kristal
etc
but
i
believe
this
beer
more
than
holds
its
own
very
crisp
and
refreshing
perfect
for
a
hot
summer
day
does
all
the
things
that
a
german
lager
does
with
plenty
of
malt
and
biscuity
tastes
id
be
satisfied
to
reach
for
this
whenever
i
see
it
all
that
said
its
not
a
bad
beer
just
not
one
of
the
best
of
the
style
i
prefer
weihenstephans
oktoberfest
if
were
talking
pale
lagers
this
was
my
first
munich
helles
style
lager
and
i
was
very
pleased
this
is
what
i
expect
a
lager
to
do
for
me
after
a
bout
of
sweltering
yard
work
pours
a
clear
deep
gold
with
a
somewhat
foamy
white
head
the
head
has
moderate
retention
and
leaves
some
light
lacing
the
aroma
is
reminiscent
of
fresh
bread
and
some
nice
earthy
hops
the
taste
closely
matches
the
aroma
and
is
just
as
enjoyable
there
is
a
nice
weight
to
the
body
a
pleasant
crispness
on
the
finish
this
is
a
great
lager
my
second
one
i
poured
into
another
chilled
glass
it
poured
nicely
and
had
a
nice
thick
foamy
head
to
it
the
color
in
the
glass
was
light
and
looked
smooth
after
taking
a
few
sips
from
my
glass
i
asked
the
waiter
where
i
could
purchase
some
of
these
to
take
home
and
i
was
given
directions
a
nearby
liquor
store
that
sometimes
carried
it
lucky
for
me
the
total
wine
in
my
hometown
of
miami
carries
this
and
it
has
become
a
favorite
brew
of
mine
first
off
let
me
start
by
saying
that
i
absolutely
love
their
hefeweizen
its
one
of
my
favorites
and
a
beer
i
give
to
noncraft
drinkers
to
rave
reviews
however
i
just
dont
get
how
this
beer
is
so
highly
rated
as
the
previous
reviewer
stated
it
has
a
skunky
smell
much
like
heineken
and
doesnt
taste
much
better
either
maybe
my
palate
isnt
advanced
enough
to
taste
all
the
flavors
people
claim
they
pick
up
in
this
one
yet
it
just
tasted
blah
in
fact
i
would
turn
it
down
offered
it
again
do
yourself
a
favor
if
you
just
have
to
try
this
beer
because
you
figure
it
must
be
good
cause
they
have
been
brewing
it
for
like
1000
years
and
their
hefe
is
so
fantastic
then
only
buy
a
single
yet
even
that
i
would
caution
against
o
i
was
hoping
for
a
less
skunky
more
malty
brew
just
like
those
sw
german
helles
lagers
that
are
not
available
here
guess
ill
have
to
look
some
more
although
im
a
little
disappointed
this
beer
is
not
bad
at
all
just
not
all
that
its
cracked
up
to
be
imho
i
think
jack
may
have
add
or
something
anyway
following
what
vdubb
referred
to
as
a
perfect
pour
this
stuff
looks
pretty
solid
a
clear
brassy
gold
topped
by
about
two
fingers
or
so
of
white
foam
the
nose
comprises
hard
water
straight
grains
noble
hops
grass
flowers
and
light
wild
rice
the
taste
brings
in
more
of
the
same
the
noble
hops
shining
against
a
backdrop
of
mineralladen
grains
the
body
straddles
the
line
between
hefty
light
and
light
medium
with
a
light
moderate
carbonation
and
a
smooth
feel
overall
a
damn
tasty
and
extremely
easytodrink
beer
why
dont
more
beer
drinkers
take
home
sixers
of
this
on
the
reg
o
beerdrinkers
of
the
world
and
by
world
i
mean
beer
advocates
really
need
to
recognise
that
there
is
definitely
a
place
for
lagers
this
was
a
great
way
to
start
my
session
easing
in
with
a
classic
and
refreshing
beverage
i
love
this
beer
and
glad
it
is
readily
available
in
the
cleveland
area
i
have
a
good
friend
who
was
skeptical
but
is
now
a
believer
as
well
as
member
ohiolager
said
move
over
hofbrau
hofbraus
is
good
too
but
this
beer
is
my
pick
at
the
moment
not
my
favorite
style
but
this
classic
beer
is
definitely
worth
trying
every
once
in
a
while
overall
this
is
a
must
have
its
drink
ability
is
superior
tastes
better
than
it
smells
and
its
from
the
worlds
oldest
brewery
for
an
import
top
that
my
new
favorite
helles
munich
lager
move
over
hofbrau
the
original
is
great
it
poured
a
clear
golden
color
with
thin
white
head
that
is
leaving
some
lace
the
scent
carries
biscuit
and
grass
like
tones
the
taste
is
well
balanced
its
starts
with
nice
bready
push
then
finishes
slightly
bitter
coming
off
the
pallet
very
clean
the
mouthfeel
is
light
to
medium
in
body
with
great
carbonation
overall
this
is
an
excellent
beer
great
for
sessioning
as
it
is
very
easy
drinking
i
would
have
this
again
and
again
and
again
a
wonderfully
done
lager
crisp
clean
delicious
flavors
very
well
balanced
overall
really
like
this
helles
lager
as
it
pretty
much
is
dead
on
clean
malt
flavors
id
like
it
a
little
drier
and
a
crisp
hop
snap
backing
it
up
simple
but
plenty
of
flavor
for
an
easy
drinking
beer
500ml
weizen
glass
o
not
a
bad
beer
by
any
means
but
i
dont
know
why
this
has
an
a
it
is
barely
different
from
a
peroni
in
my
opinion
still
a
great
beer
though
never
had
a
helles
lager
perfect
lager
better
be
perfect
if
its
been
brewed
for
over
one
thousand
years
seriously
though
what
a
badass
beer
pours
hazy
yelloworange
with
a
nice
frothy
head
that
never
goes
away
and
decorates
the
sides
of
your
glass
as
you
drink
it
obviously
an
extremely
meticulously
crafted
beer
all
the
way
through
the
definition
of
well
balanced
hop
profile
that
will
leave
you
craving
more
brilliant
impeccable
overall
does
a
helles
get
any
better
then
this
smooth
balanced
flavorful
and
very
enjoyable
world
class
and
a
must
try
not
only
for
the
style
but
because
its
a
wonderful
beer
this
beer
looks
amazing
in
the
sunlight
not
much
for
a
head
but
the
beer
is
crystal
clear
and
gold
in
color
the
amazing
part
is
the
perfectly
visible
rising
strings
of
bubbles
aroma
is
full
of
crisp
crackery
grains
and
doughy
bread
zesty
floral
and
spicy
with
perfect
slightly
sweetned
lemon
next
is
taste
flavors
are
an
excellent
reprise
of
the
aroma
crisp
and
dry
crackers
a
kiss
of
lemon
delicious
deep
and
perky
spice
some
kind
of
almost
herbal
floral
awesome
beer
right
here
super
dry
and
grainy
feel
as
well
as
chewy
faaaantastic
overall
i
cant
iterate
how
much
better
this
is
than
all
those
other
lagers
be
it
domestic
or
imports
that
just
cant
even
hold
a
candle
to
this
simply
put
those
other
beers
are
chop
meat
this
is
filet
mignon
overall
drinkability
with
a
big
meal
i
could
drink
and
drink
this
without
hesitation
a
very
drinkable
lager
and
just
right
in
regards
to
aroma
and
taste
constantly
interesting
and
full
of
flavor
but
not
overpowering
or
palate
tiring
clearly
this
beer
was
finely
engineered
to
be
drank
in
mass
quantities
with
pleasure
well
done
my
vote
for
what
should
be
in
the
dictionary
when
you
look
up
beer
o
this
is
a
fantastic
light
beer
it
is
easy
to
drink
and
unlike
most
light
beers
it
holds
a
good
amount
of
flavor
it
is
the
kind
of
beer
that
you
absolutely
love
to
sit
back
and
drink
and
look
forward
to
the
next
time
you
get
to
have
one
o
surprisingly
delicious
brew
simple
of
course
but
great
balance
mouthfeel
and
drinkability
people
talk
about
aals
being
perfect
lawnmower
beers
but
this
is
my
style
right
here
along
with
witbiers
and
hefes
original
pours
a
golden
color
with
a
nice
large
lacing
head
there
is
a
grainy
aroma
that
is
pail
the
taste
is
grainy
as
well
overly
sweet
a
little
too
much
carbonation
taste
isnt
the
best
and
strange
sweet
aftertaste
that
is
stuck
to
your
palette
overall
its
not
the
worst
but
too
sweet
and
carbonated
reminds
me
of
a
grain
soda
overall
as
light
a
lager
as
this
should
be
i
do
feel
its
lacking
a
bit
of
character
i
think
what
really
abets
this
aspect
is
the
slightly
watery
mouthfeel
which
detracts
from
the
taste
i
do
feel
however
that
this
is
an
excellent
example
of
this
traditional
style
atmosphere
is
excellent
giant
head
effervescence
is
pervasive
tons
o
lacing
nose
is
hay
grass
and
traditional
bready
components
wellbalanced
light
combination
of
bread
and
lemon
citrus
overall
this
is
a
great
quaff
overall
will
buy
this
maybe
once
in
every
three
or
four
beer
hauls
which
is
a
lot
for
someone
who
tends
to
constantly
mix
it
up
this
beer
is
appealing
to
all
types
of
beer
drinkers
i
have
come
across
and
is
incredible
for
not
just
for
a
lager
but
for
a
beer
of
any
kind
o
not
my
typical
style
but
i
was
really
digging
this
one
super
clean
and
easy
drinking
great
price
on
these
considering
i
got
a
tall
boy
for
2
99
grab
a
few
tall
boys
and
you
can
make
quite
the
session
with
these
o
wellbalanced
in
terms
of
flavor
aroma
and
feel
not
my
favorite
style
but
a
seriously
fine
example
of
a
german
lager
on
the
heavier
side
of
being
light
bodied
with
crisp
carbonation
but
feels
nice
and
full
in
the
mouth
while
remaining
extremely
smooth
sweet
dry
biscuity
malts
followed
by
herbal
hops
finishes
balanced
with
some
lingering
sweetness
goes
back
like
water
with
some
good
flavor
nice
this
is
textbook
exactly
what
this
style
should
taste
like
it
pours
a
very
light
clear
honey
color
with
an
inch
or
so
of
lasting
snow
white
head
and
jovial
carbonation
the
nose
is
less
banana
and
clove
than
the
others
but
still
there
to
some
small
extent
with
soft
and
semisweet
malts
being
balanced
by
a
hopping
only
an
old
world
german
brewery
could
execute
this
is
the
art
of
balance
ladies
and
gentlemen
very
mild
flavor
grains
first
bittering
hops
second
with
the
yeast
sort
of
uniting
both
camps
in
a
harmonious
mixture
of
german
purity
and
tradition
the
yeast
has
some
soapy
complexion
to
it
and
a
touch
of
acidity
maybe
citrus
to
cut
the
malt
sweetness
an
impressive
offering
by
any
stretch
but
the
drinkability
here
is
unrivaled
so
clean
and
bright
perfect
carbonation
expertly
refreshing
and
you
cannot
beat
the
price
o
a
good
brew
for
a
hot
day
the
super
clean
dry
flavor
and
lively
mouthfeel
makes
this
very
refreshing
despite
the
disappointing
nose
a
good
solid
brew
for
refreshment
but
not
much
else
very
easy
drinking
and
sessionable
probably
would
be
better
on
tap
overall
above
average
but
i
really
need
to
try
another
example
if
i
am
reading
the
bottle
code
correctly
this
beer
is
almost
a
year
old
still
a
fairly
good
beer
in
its
degraded
condition
transparent
light
straw
colored
ale
with
a
thick
white
head
great
retention
and
lots
of
lace
lines
crisp
herbal
aroma
with
some
fresh
grains
and
grass
thrown
in
bready
malt
character
in
the
flavor
with
rice
and
corn
very
well
balanced
with
an
herbal
grassy
hop
bitterness
hint
of
garlic
finish
is
crisp
with
lingering
hop
spice
light
bodied
lots
of
bubbles
highly
refreshing
a
tasty
german
lager
which
i
could
thoroughly
enjoy
yearround
o
ridiculously
drinkable
beer
with
perhaps
a
little
more
sweetness
then
i
would
expect
and
prefer
i
want
to
give
it
higher
rankings
based
on
the
others
ive
had
from
this
brewery
and
while
it
is
tasty
there
are
many
other
options
from
this
brewery
and
others
that
i
would
prefer
fairly
malty
slightly
sweet
with
spicy
noble
hop
character
and
a
bit
of
minerally
notes
very
clean
easily
drinkable
beer
this
is
a
world
class
beer
easy
to
drink
yet
complex
overall
this
is
just
great
extremely
enjoyable
and
drinkable
dont
see
anyone
who
wouldnt
like
this
as
long
as
they
like
beer
overall
every
beer
i
picked
up
by
these
guys
has
been
amazing
will
have
to
track
down
their
festbier
next
worth
the
price
tasty
and
smoother
than
water
o
man
this
is
the
lager
of
lagers
its
usually
not
really
my
style
of
choice
but
i
could
see
myself
ordering
this
again
on
a
rare
occasion
crisp
clean
flavors
mixed
with
an
exceptionally
smooth
feel
make
this
one
of
the
most
pleasant
lagers
to
be
had
been
reading
about
about
helles
lagers
over
the
last
few
days
this
is
a
great
example
and
really
a
lovely
delightfully
refreshing
beer
not
my
favorite
style
but
so
good
to
have
once
in
a
while
and
great
for
a
session
or
on
a
hot
day
after
mowing
the
lawn
o
this
is
a
great
and
inexpensive
lager
i
dont
quite
buy
into
the
hype
nor
do
i
put
it
up
there
with
their
hefeweissbier
however
this
is
a
very
solid
beer
for
an
easier
drinking
choice
either
for
a
session
beer
or
for
a
hot
day
outdoors
much
easier
to
drink
than
a
weissbier
for
my
first
review
ill
write
up
one
of
my
favorite
warm
weather
beers
this
is
a
perfect
lager
one
of
the
best
ive
ever
had
light
floral
nose
with
honey
notes
delicious
full
mouth
feel
and
crisp
refreshing
flavor
honey
honey
sweet
without
being
cloying
one
sip
begats
another
until
its
all
gone
love
this
beer
high
drinkability
distinct
grassiness
crisp
flavor
a
wonderful
session
beer
one
of
my
favorite
lagers
o
quite
disappointed
this
brew
comes
nowhere
near
my
45
favorite
as
of
now
helles
lagers
a
very
average
beer
without
much
going
for
it
wouldnt
mind
trying
this
on
tap
but
i
doubt
ill
ever
buy
a
bottle
again
on
a
sad
side
note
i
offered
one
of
these
to
a
friend
who
tasted
it
and
said
wow
thats
good
tastes
just
like
miller
high
life
i
just
stared
at
him
this
is
one
of
the
best
pale
brews
ive
had
it
is
immensely
refreshing
a
hybrid
of
a
lager
and
a
pils
the
lemon
in
the
smell
is
the
first
on
the
scene
followed
by
the
biscuits
it
is
the
same
with
the
taste
except
the
lemon
dominates
most
of
it
you
could
drink
this
every
day
but
mostly
on
warmer
days
actually
its
just
as
excellent
on
cold
days
i
would
definitely
get
this
again
no
kidding
weihenstephan
does
it
again
im
beginning
to
think
that
they
can
do
no
wrong
as
there
isnt
a
beer
by
them
that
ive
tried
and
havent
liked
im
starting
to
grow
more
fond
of
the
helles
lager
style
and
this
is
a
good
place
to
start
for
anyone
who
is
venturing
in
that
direction
as
well
cant
say
i
like
this
one
as
much
as
schlenkerlas
helles
lager
its
that
smoke
baby
but
its
still
damn
good
and
oh
so
insanely
drinkable
after
years
of
drinking
weihenstephaner
hefeweissbier
i
finally
got
around
to
trying
weihenstephaner
original
and
i
am
glad
that
i
did
it
was
immensely
refreshing
and
surprisingly
full
flavored
this
would
be
a
perfect
warm
weather
beer
i
am
not
a
big
lager
fan
in
general
but
this
is
a
delightful
beer
shows
you
what
a
traditional
munich
hells
is
suppsosed
to
be
very
nice
i
would
try
it
again
rjt
o
wow
a
pale
lager
that
i
actually
enjoyed
very
mild
and
friendly
tasting
this
is
surely
drinkable
but
entirely
ordinary
and
nowhere
near
the
league
of
weihenstephaners
vastly
superior
offerings
i
find
it
odd
that
the
brewerys
original
brew
is
by
far
its
most
average
but
most
things
would
seem
that
way
compared
to
their
weissbiers
solid
and
refreshing
drinks
very
easily
i
still
prefer
the
hefeweiss
but
this
beer
is
unique
in
its
own
way
and
you
can
tell
it
was
carefully
crafted
not
a
bad
place
to
start
if
you
are
just
getting
into
german
beer
o
perfect
summer
thirst
quencher
i
can
see
why
this
is
considered
a
textbook
example
of
a
classic
munich
helles
lager
good
stuff
o
exceptionally
drinkable
really
the
prototypical
german
beer
im
new
to
beer
so
im
still
developing
my
palate
and
finding
out
what
i
like
this
beer
is
absolutely
exceptional
very
smooth
and
delicious
you
experience
just
a
hint
of
sweetness
at
the
first
sip
before
the
bitter
flavors
kick
in
it
is
very
balanced
and
nota
at
all
overwhelming
i
really
enjoyed
it
and
will
definitely
buy
again
bros
be
more
critical
so
theres
actually
a
reliable
rating
and
im
not
referring
to
this
beer
but
pretty
much
any
review
has
90
you
even
communicate
beer
karma
rules
so
might
be
worthwhile
to
consider
this
yourself
as
well
be
more
detailed
in
the
rating
is
all
im
saying
100
means
its
perfect
and
whats
the
benchmark
my
benchmark
is
ive
never
had
the
perfect
beer
so
100
is
pretty
much
impossible
unless
i
really
feel
like
heaven
drinking
a
beer
this
beer
made
you
feel
in
heaven
you
can
like
it
dont
mind
me
but
be
realistic
overall
pretty
solid
beer
and
now
i
know
it
is
considered
one
of
the
best
within
this
style
awesome
beer
to
enjoy
with
dinner
pours
a
crisp
clear
straw
golden
color
with
a
large
foamy
white
head
nose
is
bready
and
floral
with
grass
straw
light
citrus
and
dough
crisp
body
with
a
doughy
grain
flavor
and
a
light
grassy
lemon
citrus
finish
overall
not
a
bad
beer
at
all
i
strongly
endorse
this
one
this
is
the
kind
of
beer
you
want
on
a
summer
afternoon
not
a
bad
beer
i
guess
my
first
of
the
kind
although
it
reminded
me
more
of
a
light
lager
than
anything
else
weihenstephaner
is
just
so
good
im
3for3
now
with
two
more
to
drink
in
my
fridge
o
a
tasty
light
very
drinkable
helles
personal
rate
3
75
mouthfeel
is
good
perfect
session
beer
the
beer
pours
a
slightly
hazy
lightlypinkish
yellow
much
like
slightly
cloudy
piss
the
head
is
massive
and
beautifully
stark
white
with
a
creamy
tight
texture
and
tinny
little
bubbles
carbonation
appears
moderate
in
the
body
of
the
beer
which
is
the
faintest
bit
hazy
but
truthfully
quite
clear
lacing
is
in
thin
sticky
sheets
that
run
little
lines
across
the
glass
on
the
nose
the
beer
smells
sweet
and
spicy
much
like
a
czech
pilsner
sweet
sticky
grain
malt
mixes
with
spicy
grassy
hops
to
tantalize
the
nose
with
varying
layers
slight
caramel
and
biscuit
can
also
be
detected
in
the
malt
and
faint
citrus
plays
alongside
the
spices
the
beer
tastes
wonderfully
bready
with
light
spices
from
the
hops
on
the
opening
sip
the
spices
tingle
slightly
at
the
beginning
alongside
a
steadily
growing
bready
flavor
which
eventually
explodes
in
the
middle
of
the
taste
drowning
out
the
hops
momentarily
with
its
creamy
biscuit
qualities
before
mellowing
light
citrus
and
hay
with
spicy
zest
and
a
faint
lingering
taste
of
biscuit
on
the
tongue
the
beer
is
crisp
and
bubbly
though
not
too
much
so
the
beers
holds
properly
thin
and
drinkable
in
the
mouth
and
it
leaves
the
mouth
quite
clean
with
light
droplets
of
saliva
on
the
tongue
overall
the
beer
is
quite
refreshing
and
drinkable
with
some
nice
malty
complexity
although
i
do
wish
more
of
the
spicy
hops
were
able
to
transfer
over
from
the
smell
to
the
flavor
a
terrific
munich
helles
with
some
nice
flavor
to
rest
alongside
the
easy
drinkability
and
a
great
start
to
my
weihenstephan
experience
a
must
try
cheers
overall
a
very
solid
lager
maybe
not
an
everyday
winner
for
me
but
nice
for
a
change
a
classic
german
beer
that
is
a
definite
session
beer
and
a
very
above
average
yet
still
basic
lager
its
quite
easy
to
drink
readily
available
and
inexpensive
a
winning
combo
and
a
solid
overall
beer
that
basically
set
the
style
guidelines
i
get
a
lot
more
of
the
nuttiness
as
it
warms
no
wonder
germans
like
warm
beer
this
one
is
good
ill
have
to
keep
an
eye
out
for
it
next
time
i
go
to
a
german
restaurant
has
a
dry
finish
nothing
here
that
supports
a
price
point
of
over
30
00
a
case
poured
into
a
glass
mug
pours
pale
golden
with
a
tall
white
head
and
plentiful
visible
tiny
bubbles
the
head
retreats
leaving
some
lacing
on
the
side
of
the
glass
this
is
the
typical
helles
lager
smell
theres
the
bready
and
biscuit
type
malt
with
some
grassy
hops
the
taste
absolutely
follows
the
nose
theres
a
solid
malt
profile
here
that
has
some
biscuit
notes
the
noble
hops
add
some
grassy
and
spicy
notes
the

this
is
an
excellent
beer
o
this
is
king
of
the
helles
as
far
as
im
concerned
there
is
no
flaw
in
this
beer
a
simple
but
pleasing
style
executed
to
perfection
it
appalls
me
that
this
sits
on
the
shelf
put
down
your
harpoons
and
halt
the
whale
hunt
long
enough
to
drink
and
appreciate
the
truly
great
beers
that
are
regularly
at
your
disposal
lots
of
foam
that
is
quite
persistent
overtime
appereance
and
aroma
what
is
expected
from
a
munich
helles
lager
light
body
with
good
carbonation
flavor
of
malt
and
raw
grains
which
keeps
constant
without
any
unwanted
mutation
high
drinkability
actually
as
high
as
it
gets
food
match
you
could
almost
make
a
sandwich
with
the
bold
bread
flavours
in
this
brew
or
in
the
least
forego
the
slice
of
bread
at
meal
time
german
food
is
an
obvious
choice
of
course
quiche
would
also
pair
well
o
extremely
drinkable
my
new
favorite
munich
helles
lager
served
from
bottle
into
a
sampler
shaker
poured
a
pale
golden
yellow
with
a
half
finger
white
head
that
subsided
to
a
minimal
amount
quickly
maintained
decent
lacing
throughout
the
glass
the
aroma
was
comprised
of
sweet
malt
fruit
spice
and
wheat
the
flavor
was
of
sweet
malt
fruit
spice
and
wheat
it
had
a
light
feel
on
the
palate
with
mediumhigh
carbonation
overall
this
was
a
fairly
good
brew
i
was
really
quite
impressed
with
what
i
found
going
on
in
this
one
for
the
style
it
was
very
refreshing
and
inviting
for
the
palate
this
fact
made
it
extremely
easy
to
drink
and
i
could
see
this
one
being
enjoyed
in
fairly
larger
quantities
without
too
much
trouble
a
solid
offering
from
this
brewery
that
i
would
not
hesitate
to
suggest
to
anyone
out
there
overall
delicious
and
good
for
you
overall
the
prototypical
german
lager
not
too
big
easy
drinking
delicious
its
a
shame
budweiser
doesnt
taste
like
this
i
wonder
what
this
would
be
like
freshit
has
all
of
the
makings
of
a
wonderfully
subtle
and
refreshing
lager
body
is
mediumlight
to
light
with
spritzy
lightly
tingly
carbonation
this
results
in
a
crisp
slightly
foamy
flowing
mouthfeel
the
beer
never
lasts
too
long
on
the
palate
hops
are
noticeable
in
the
spiciness
they
provide
to
the
mouthfeel
finish
is
semidry
this
beer
pours
up
a
crystal
clear
pale
amber
with
about
two
fingers
worth
of
head
and
a
little
bit
of
lacing
the
nose
is
bread
earthiness
and
sweet
apples
mouthfeel
is
close
to
perfect
with
just
the
right
amount
of
carbonation
taste
is
fairly
mild
but
complex
just
the
same
an
understated
sweetness
giving
way
to
an
understated
bitterness
on
the
finish
and
no
lingering
aftertaste
ive
had
this
bottle
for
a
couple
of
months
and
just
kept
passing
it
over
it
is
easily
one
of
the
finest
offering
i
have
tasted
as
of
late
probably
the
best
munich
helles
lager
i
ever
drank
overall
its
definitely
overshadowed
by
other
weihenstephaner
beers
but
this
is
a
very
good
helles
lager
worth
checking
out
i
go
on
german
kicks
occasionally
and
ill
be
back
for
this
beer
the
next
time
i
crave
something
german
overall
nice
and
refreshing
though
probably
my
least
favorite
weihenstephaner
the
worldrenowed
weihenstephaner
hef
has
a
tendency
to
overshadow
the
other
beers
from
this
brewery
and
thats
a
shame
because
there
are
some
other
good
ones
in
their
catalog
the
original
is
one
of
them
decidedly
more
rich
than
their
pilsener
and
one
of
the
best
overall
lagers
ive
tried
the
beer
has
great
clarity
and
perfectly
pure
taste
try
one
drinkability
a
good
beer
in
the
munich
helles
lager
overall
excellent
brew
as
expected
i
cannot
wait
to
try
it
a
bit
fresher
in
germany
when
i
get
a
chance
lighter
body
with
soft
carbonation
fairly
clean
overall
easy
to
drink
maybe
not
my
favorite
german
lager
but
not
bad
i
dont
think
ive
ever
had
something
so
light
flavorful
and
underappreicated
o
a
solid
lager
from
a
solid
brewery
weihenstephaner
never
disappoints
but
i
would
love
to
try
a
super
fresh
one
o
delicious
would
buy
this
any
day
especially
a
beach
or
pool
day
refreshing
for
all
the
praise
as
a
classic
german
beer
it
tastes
like
another
dull
lager
in
my
experience
with
it
on
tap
at
pizza
port
in
ob
i
really
like
their
wheat
beers
so
i
might
try
this
again
but
in
the
bottle
this
is
a
well
put
together
quaffable
beer
it
has
enough
flavor
to
keep
you
interested
its
perfectly
to
style
and
its
very
refreshing
ill
definitely
give
this
a
go
again
a
classic
and
beautifully
crafted
german
lager
and
an
easy
drinking
quenching
choice
on
a
hot
summer
day
superb
session
brew
too
this
defines
the
helles
style
o
a
very
fine
lager
from
germany
id
love
to
try
this
one
fresh
even
skunked
its
incredible
the
weheinstephaner
is
an
excellent
example
of
a
helles
lager
the
augustiner
is
still
my
favorite
though
i
havent
had
it
in
a
while
but
the
weheinstephaner
has
that
perfect
light
bready
german
flavor
and
that
clean
lightly
bitter
taste
that
balances
perfectly
but
like
the
selfless
workingmans
beer
it
is
doesnt
linger
too
long
because
it
understands
that
you
have
places
to
be
and
things
to
do
it
is
a
fizzy
yellow
beer
yes
but
it
german
lagers
are
the
paradigms
of
all
fizzy
yellow
beers
and
this
one
still
has
a
nice
creamy
head
and
light
lacing
down
the
glass
that
belies
a
beer
with
much
more
class
and
style
than
americans
expect
from
fizzy
yellow
beers
if
all
your
friends
could
be
exemplified
in
fizzy
yellow
beers
then
the
helles
lager
is
your
welldressed
european
friend
whos
a
very
nice
guy
and
tends
to
pick
up
surprisingly
attractive
women
and
it
smells
like
the
south
of
germany
it
smells
like
a
great
vacation
it
smells
like
summertime
overall
im
not
big
on
lagers
but
this
one
is
fantastic
reminiscent
of
heineken
only
much
much
better
very
nice
helles
lager
and
one
that
hide
from
me
on
the
shelves
delicious
and
so
easy
to
drink
crisp
but
delicate
not
overly
dry
on
the
finish
nice
balance
and
a
lot
of
flavor
clean
very
enjoyable
i
think
the
best
part
is
that
this
beer
is
very
easy
to
get
we
can
get
it
in
almost
any
beer
shop
in
the
area
one
of
the
best
lagers
ive
tasted
nice
to
have
as
a
break
from
some
of
the
more
aggressive
beers
cheers
o
a
classic
this
would
definitely
appeal
to
the
noncraft
crowd
and
might
help
steer
them
into
the
light
easy
to
drink
affordable
especially
for
an
import
and
is
fairly
simplistic
a
musttry
for
all
those
lagerlovers
mouthfeel
is
clean
crisp
and
light
bodied
making
for
a
very
refreshing
beverage
overall
these
germans
are
onto
something
here
with
such
a
refreshing
and
easy
drinking
beer
would
love
to
have
this
one
fresh
from
the
source
o
it
take
a
lot
to
impress
me
with
a
lager
and
this
one
certainly
does
not
only
excellent
for
style
but
just
a
plain
excellent
beer
o
overall
i
thought
this
was
a
very
well
made
helles
lager
not
traditionally
a
style
im
crazy
about
this
is
one
of
the
better
ones
ive
had
some
nice
belgian
notes
mixing
with
floral
and
citrus
and
super
easy
to
drink
would
certainly
have
it
again
and
could
see
it
being
a
great
summer
night
beer
o
awesome
one
of
the
better
pale
lagers
ive
had
a
good
step
up
for
the
bmc
crowd
while
still
being
complex
enough
to
enjoy
as
a
more
discerning
beer
drinker
o
a
very
drinkable
lager
that
is
miles
above
others
in
its
genre
delicious
overall
just
an
outstanding
lager
extremely
thirst
quenching
and
a
perfect
example
of
style
no
wonder
this
beer
has
been
pleasing
drinkers
since
1040
serving
type
bottle
overall
one
of
the
better
beers
within
the
style
for
sure
it
is
very
crisp
and
refreshing
while
not
being
overly
light
not
the
type
of
beer
that
will
wow
you
with
some
sort
of
novelty
just
a
solid
well
made
very
drinkable
beer
o
i
am
not
generally
a
lager
guy
but
this
was
terrific
the
numbers
i
gave
this
do
not
necessarily
reflect
how
much
i
actually
enjoyed
this
beer
this
is
very
easy
to
drink
and
very
tasty
and
since
it
is
reasonably
priced
it
is
very
sessionable
i
see
myself
drinking
much
more
of
this
in
the
future

some

there
is
a
mild
bitterness
on
the
palate
with
each
sip
this
beer
has
a
crisp
mouthfeel
with
a
bubbly
quality
overall
this
is
a
very
tasty
and
crisp
lager
that
is
very
easy
to
drink
much
different
from
the
other
beers
weihenstephan
offers
but
a
good
choice
nonetheless
this
is
what
a
lager
should
be

cant
get
those
here
so
this
will
do
smelled

tasted
a
bit
sweet
grainy
with
a
mild
hoppiness
refreshing
and
easy
to
drink
a
pretty
tasty
beer
i
would
certainly
drink
it
again
o
an
amazing
beer
that
is
sessionable
what
all
lagers
should
aspire
to
be
o
you
dont
survive
as
the
oldest
brewery
in
the
world
if
you
cant
make
a
good
beer
thankfully
they
make
great
beers

i
would
love
to
have
this
after
mowing
the
lawn
on
a
hot
summer
day
excellent
mouthfeel
sets
the
bar
very
high
exceptionally
light
bodied
with
more
than
moderate

refreshing
and
tingly
great
beer
id
love
to
have
it
on

in
germany
though
im
sure
theres
a
lot
that
we
americans
are
missing
pours
a
clean
deep
yellow
color
with
a
white
head
in
the
aroma
a
small
gingerbread
like
malt
and
not
much
of
anything
really
in
the
taste
a
gingerbread
like
malt
and
a
note

lighter

in
the
aftertaste
a
mix

eh
overall
great
tasting
drink
from
a
great
tasting
brewery
they
never
seem
to
fail
pair
with
a
nice
overall
c
fantastic
truly
a
beautifully
made
product
with
lots
of
love
and
respect
for
the
art
and
tradition
of
brewing
one
of
the
best
lagers
ive
ever
had
and
one
the
best
ill
ever
have
the
color
was
a
very
nice
golden
clean
and
active
blonde
like
a
good
lagerthe
head
was
a
bit
flatand
the
lacing
was
lacking
the
smell
was
a
very
nice
breadysweet
malty
odor
the
tase
was
that
as
wellbut
a
tad
bitter
at
the
end
still
very
good
just
not
quite
as
balanced
to
me
as
a
samuel
smith
or
even
a
paulaneri
did
love
this
beerhowever
all
4s
o
im
generally
an
ale
drinker
brought
up
on
english
bitter
and
lagers
dont
often
find
their
way
into
my
fridge
this
is
one
that
does
its
an
excellent
example
of
the
style
clean
refreshing
full
of
all
the
right
flavours
overall
i
might
have
received
a
bad
batch
of
this
or
something
but
havent
gotten
back
around
to
it
definitely
not
my
style
but
im
sure
if
its
good
enough
for
the
bros
its
good
enough
for
others
pours
a
golden
yellow
color
with
a
half
finger
white
head
which
quickly
disappears
extremely
clear
and
clean
looking
brew
very
easy
to
see
through
decent
lacing
on
my
glass
as
well
the
nose
is
grass
lemon
mild
hops
and
a
little
bit
of
malt
very
pleasant
and
clean
the
taste
follows
the
same
suit
and
has
a
nice
mild
sweetness
to
it
the
feel
is
well
carbonated
medium
bodied
and
has
a
clean
sweet
finish
overall
a
nice
refreshing
beer
cheers
o
i
was
very
surprised
with
this
brew
lagers
arent
normally
my
cup
of
tea
but
this
would
be
an
excellent
introduction
to
a
newbie
drinker
so
much
better
than
the
main
stream
lagers
out
there
it
actually
has
taste
and
is
well
balanced
and
at
just
over
5
its
also
a
great
session
beer
while
i
am
always
trying
new
and
different
crafts
this
is
one
to
stay
in
the
fridge
all
the
time
i
didnt
particularly
care
for
this
brew
simply
because
i
have
grown
away
from
many
lagers
but
if
i
ever
want
an
excellent
german
lager
you
can
be
sure
ill
pick
up
some
more
the
body
is
a
bit
more
full
and
rounded
than
it
looks
once
the
carbonation
subsides
it
invites
huge
thirstquenching
gulps
nice
beer
very
nice
compliments
the
spicy
bbq
and
slaw
ive
been
enjoying
mothfeel
enhances
the
spices
from
the
sauce
nicely
its
been
a
minute
since
ive
had
a
nice
lager
but
id
call
it
a
pale
lager
paradigm
o
super
easy
drinking
and
a
great
example
of
a
helles
this
is
a
simple
straightforward
enjoyable
lawnmower
beer
with
good
malt
flavor
very
drinkable
classic
helles
example
i
really
enjoyed
this
beer
and
would
have
it
again
it
has
a
medium
bodied
refreshingly
clean
taste
the
beer
is
evenly
balanced
with
a
gentle
burnt
corn
and
hop
finish
i
dont
get
a
lot
of
depth
in
this
just
a
real
smooth
highly
drinkable
lager
that
i
thoroughly
enjoyed
trying
this
is
one
of
the
better
helles
lagers
ive
had
the
mouthfeel
is
light
with
carbonation
being
moderate
overall
it
was
a
very
good
beer
of
the
style
nicely
flavored
and
well
balanced
o
this
fits
the
style
of
a
munich
helles
lager
quite
nicely
i
never
really
was
a
fan
of
this
style
but
with
the
grassiness
that
this
gives
its
quite
beautiful
i
love
nature
in
my
drinks
oak
pine
and
grass
this
will
be
something
that
i
will
like
if
i
could
find
it
in
large
quantities
o
this
should
be
a
nice
light
quaffer
instead
im
sitting
here
sipping
it
slowly
its
just
that
complex
and
enjoyable
and
this
is
during
december
i
cant
wait
for
summer
to
get
here
ill
buy
it
by
the
case
as
ive
gotten
older
my
palette
has
turned
a
little
bit
more
towards
pilsners
and
pale
lagers
i
dont
know
yet
where
this
one
ranks
among
its
brethren
but
its
way
up
there
a
beautiful
beer
overall
this
is
a
pretty
refreshing
brew
overall
its
ok
but
not
up
to
the
other
brews
of
the
brewery
notes
such
a
solid
german
lager
and
certainly
very
drinkable
cheers
overall
this
is
a
very
good
beer
and
one
of
the
tops
in
the
style
i
dont
drink
this
near
as
often
as
i
should
overall
clean
smooth
well
balanced
classic
lager
unpretentious
and
exactly
what
you
would
expect
from
a
traditional
brew
simple
and
straightforward
not
my
favorite
style
but
a
very
smooth
and
solid
beer
and
probably
better
when
fresh
from
the
source
overall
very
drinkable
i
could
easily
buy
a
six
pack
of
these
and
enjoy
every
one
good
german
lager
i
give
two
reverent
schlitz
for
this
the
standard
of
beer
not
a
bad
beer
to
have
with
a
grinderhoagiesubwhathaveyou
while
watching
the
early
afternoon
game
which
was
actually
jetsbills
o
a
very
crisp
and
refreshing
well
balanced
lager
that
would
be
fantastic
on
a
hot
summers
day
o
its
a
pretty
good
beer
its
a
mild
flavor
hitter
just
because
of
the
style
but
you
could
drink
the
snot
out
of
these
gimme
a
nice
beer
garden
pretzels
and
im
good
to
go
here
othis
is
a
fantastic
beer
its
not
an
extremely
flavorful
beer
but
what
it
lacks
in
flavor
it
makes
up
for
in
overall
drinkability
and
quality
i
wish
this
type
of
beer
could
be
found
in
6packs
and
on
tap
all
over
its
a
great
goto
beer
o
this
is
a
very
clean
and
wellmade
helles
it
is
not
my
favorite
style
but
this
is
clearly
an
excellent
example
overall
this
is
a
great
lager
maybe
even
one
of
the
best
ive
ever
had
have
yet
to
be
dissapointed
by
this
brewery
m
refreshing
easy
to
drink
with
a
balanced
flavor
not
too
sweet
not
to
bitter
with
a
medium
ending
the
taste
is
the
same
as
the
aroma
the
beer
is
crisp
dry
and
refreshing
the
body
is
soft
and
delicate
the
spicy
floral
hops
finish
neatly
this
beer
is
very
drinkable
this
is
one
of
the
finest
lagers
ive
ever
had
great
beer
lots
of
flavor
i
could
drown
in
a
vat
of
this
and
die
happy
o
im
not
the
biggest
lager
fan
but
this
beer
gets
the
job
done
beautifully
this
beer
is
light
enough
and
very
drinkable
which
is
why
it
can
be
paired
with
a
lot
of
foods
and
enjoyed
at
pretty
much
any
time
another
quality
product
from
bayerische
weihenstephan
i
dont
care
much
for
the
style
but
i
could
probably
be
swayed
if
i
drank
more
beers
like
this
one
o
pretty
basic
but
its
a
lager
isnt
it
nothing
big
or
bold
about
this
but
very
sessionable
d
easy
to
drink
and
quite
tasty
the
best
lager
ive
tasted
to
date
o
a
true
well
rounded
classic
german
drinking
brew
pours
a
pale
golden
yellow
color
with
a
thick
filmy
white
head
that
clung
to
the
glass
i
could
smell
lemon
peel
and
grassy
hops
its
kind
of
tart
and
sour
tastes
of
hay
and
lemon
with
a
nice
malt
flavor
with
a
mild
metallic
hint
the
beer
is
very
smooth
and
low
in
carbonation
with
a
dry
finish
this
beer
is
really
good
and
i
could
drink
it
all
day
as
far
as
im
concerned
the
wonderful
folks
at
weihenstephaner
can
do
no
wrong
bravo
very
good
beer
i
could
drink
a
lot
of
these
and
im
an
ipa
guy
respect
overall
good
beer
overall
the
aroma
and
flavor
are
up
there
with
any
pilsner
ive
had
weihenstephaner
never
disappoints
i
love
their
hefe
so
im
excited
to
try
the
lager
although
not
my
favorite
style
this
pours
a
clear
light
yellow
straw
color
with
a
nice
foamy
white
head
the
smell
is
very
clean
and
crisp
i
get
lots
of
floral
hops
a
little
grain
not
bad
feel
is
medium
with
moderate
carbonation
the
taste
is
pretty
good
also
very
crisp
and
slightly
dry
it
has
some
grainy
malts
up
front
with
a
nice
hop
balance
overall
this
was
pretty
good
but
ill
stick
to
the
far
superior
and
more
flavorful
hefe
o
overall
i
enjoyed
this
beer
alot
weihenstephan
really
doesnt
make
a
bad
beer
everything
is
quality
would
buy
again
o
an
excellent
if
delicatelyflavored
lager
that
is
easydrinking
and
refreshing
too
light
and
too
close
to
ordinary
to
be
very
interesting
a
very
flavourful
lager
bright
is
indeed
a
good
way
to
describe
it
i
could
see
putting
back
these
easily
stein
after
stein
this
one
pours
a
light
bodied
vibrant
gold
in
color
with
great
clarity
and
a
two
finger
bright
white
sudsy
head
the
aromas
consist
of
a
light
pilsner
esque
malt
light
honey
like
sweetness
with
a
very
light
bitter
hop
finish
the
flavors
are
spot
on
for
a
munich
blonde
it
has
nice
pale
malty
sweetness
with
a
touch
of
honey
and
an
ever
so
slight
dry
and
hoppy
finish
the
finish
is
nice
and
smooth
and
overall
refreshing
the
flavor
reminds
me
of
fresh
a
hofbrau
munich
helles
from
the
hofbrau
house
this
bottle
drinks
exceptionally
fresh
and
crisp
this
is
a
top
notch
beer
for
the
style
and
a
great
beer
for
a
hot
day
if
this
were
americas
national
style
i
doubt
too
many
people
would
complain
o
overall
i
am
not
a
fan
big
disappointment
from
such
a
brilliant
brewery
my
pour
created
almost
two
fingers
of
foamy
bonewhite
head
with
good
retention
color
was
a
lemonyellow
with
nequality
clarity
nose
had
a
pleasant
grassy
saaz
hops
odor
underlain
by
a
biscuit
maltiness
my
mouth
began
to
water
in
anticipation
mouthfeel
was
medium
with
a
clean
lightly
grassy
bitterness
on
the
tongue
i
really
love
drinking
adjunctfree
lager
especially
after
so
many
aals
on
the
canquest
tm
my
fermentor
lew
bryson
has
described
lagers
as
the
equvalent
of
frozen
tundra
with
nothing
to
hide
behind
that
would
sum
up
this
beer
it
was
slightly
dry
on
the
finish
refreshing
and
very
pleasant
now
if
they
would
just
put
it
in
a
can
o
wellbalanced
complex
mature
in
its
flavor
profile
and
easydrinking
this
is
a
beer
that
ill
definitely
have
again
especially
if
i
ever
make
it
to
germany
where
i
can
have
it
fresh
two
offerings
this
good
make
me
want
to
go
nuts
and
get
every
beer
this
brewery
makes
so
thats
what
ill
do
more
weihenstephaner
reviews
to
come
these
guys
are
just
too
good
to
be
overlooked
o
interestingly
enough
the
label
classifies
this
as
a
malt
liquor
this
is
far
and
above
the
best
malt
liquor
ive
had
haha
no
but
seriously
this
a
great
refreshing
german
lager
that
is
a
great
beer
for
a
hot
summers
day
117
degrees
heat
index
today
or
a
good
session
o
no
doubt
about
this
being
a
german
lager
biscuity
bready
malts
like
fresh
baked
bread
creamy
mouthfeel
light
ant
refreshing
zesty
carbonation
moderate
bitterness
dries
out
the
sweetness
of
the
malt
on
the
finish
some
toffee
hints
floral
and
a
bit
spicey
in
the
middle
overall
a
very
nice
pils
spaten
is
still
my
fav
overall
this
is
really
good
this
is
a
super
refreshing
and
thirst
qunecher
a
very
elegant
and
sophisticated
beer
that
focus
on
the
malt
and
yeast
drink
a
german
classic
and
tasty
but
not
my
fav
style
glad
i
reviewed
on
tap
tasty
but
not
for
me
in
the
future
this
is
the
best
beer
your
money
can
buy
9
99
a
six
pack
is
a
deal
of
a
lifetime
for
such
a
fine
beer
enjoy
this
beer
regularly
and
keep
them
producing
this
for
the
price
nothing
can
or
will
ever
match
this
in
style
or
expertise
highest
recommendation
i
just
wish
i
could
find
this
on
tap
in
bowling
green
ky
overallgood
beer
very
drinkable
sessionable
could
drink
a
6
pack
very
often
dvery
easy
drinking
but
a
little
too
simple
and
understated
for
my
taste
notes
a
quality
well
made
lager
a
little
bit
watery
but
no
other
imperfections
lacks
the
wow
factor
of
spaten
but
decentnonetheless
a
nice
aromatic
and
refreshing
lager
tasted
at
a
blind
sampling
overall
this
is
really
good
this
is
a
super
refreshing
and
thirst
quenching
lager
the
best
ive
had
in
a
while
o
hands
down
my
favorite
helles
i
have
ever
had
i
love
the
style
and
i
will
regularly
purchase
this
when
available
must
try
wouldnt
go
out
of
my
way
to
get
it
again
but
would
never
turn
it
down
either
in
all
the
original
is
just
another
solid
and
delicious
beer
from
possibly
germanys
best
brewery
i
think
i
could
enjoy
this
beer
in
nearly
any
situation
mouthfeel
is
crisp
clean
and
satisfying
another
bavarian
classicthis
munich
helles
lager
is
fantastic
i
have
a
hard
time
seeing
how
you
can
improve
upon
this
offering
in
this
category
very
solid
lager
here
theres
a
nice
balance
between
the
malt
and
the
noble
hops
that
makes
this
quite
drinkable
and
enjoyable
id
drink
this
anytime
recommended
this
beer
is
a
golden
yellow
with
a
large
amount
of
carbonation
rising
up
through
the
glass
a
thin
layer
of
head
that
curtains
the
sides
of
the
glass
the
nose
contains
a
lot
of
straw
and
a
spicy
hint
of
hops
the
taste
is
very
crisp
and
smooth
a
solid
amount
of
carbonation
tingle
as
well
the
flavor
is
light
but
dynamic
the
straw
is
present
right
off
the
bat
but
it
has
a
light
honeylemon
zest
with
a
balance
of
a
light
amount
of
hop
pepper
the
aftertaste
is
malty
and
sweet
great
beer
on
a
warm
spring
day
overall
a
solid
helles
from
the
worlds
oldest
brewery
i
would
definitely
recommend
and
definitely
go
back
to
again
if
you
are
a
helles
lager
fan
this
is
a
prime
example
along
with
lowenbrau
original
absolutely
fantastic
beers
extra
points
given
for
the
really
clean
taste
but
it
may
be
a
bit
too
clean
i
was
hoping
for
more
flavor
still
it
wouldnt
be
a
chore
to
down
a
few
of
these
cheers
o
a
delightful
beer
to
drink
makes
me
jealous
that
this
and
beer
like
this
are
the
norm
in
europe
as
opposed
to
the
standard
offering
at
bars
around
here
this
along
with
the
hefe
have
made
me
into
a
weihenstephaner
fanboy
and
i
dont
see
myself
turning
back
o
overall
this
is
a
very
nice
beer
and
a
premium
example
of
the
style
delicious
crisp
refreshing
would
be
the
best
way
to
describe
this
lager
tastewise
hands
down
one
of
the
finest
lagers
i
have
had
the
chance
to
enjoy
definitely
worth
a
try
and
comes
highly
recommended
o
this
beer
does
deserve
its
high
marks
a
perfect
german
helles
imho
i
wont
get
it
often
but
will
enjoy
it
when
i
do
this
was
a
delicious
beer
immediately
you
taste
the
wheat
followed
by
a
malty
character
that
lingers
for
just
the
right
amount
of
time
this
is
an
exceptional
lager
from
a
treasured
brewery
i
have
not
had
a
weihenstephaner
that
i
have
not
loved
i
highly
recommend
the
beer
as
a
classic
example
of
a
german
lager
overall
this
is
a
really
nice
beverage
this
tastes
like
a
really
refined
lager
that
other
breweries
should
strive
for
how
can
you
not
like
this
great
with
or
without
food
easy
to
drink
great
lingering
flavors
good
for
any
season
this
is
going
to
be
great
when
i
get
the
grill
going
this
year
an
absolute
return
to
this
pours
a
light
golden
yellow
with
a
big
twofinger
bright
white
head
looks
like
a
bmc
commercial
awesome
lacing
and
head
retention
nice
subtle
aroma
yeasty
and
grassy
with
a
bit
of
lemon
extremely
crisp
and
refreshing
light
crisp
hops
start
it
off
follow
the
nose
grassy
and
a
bit
of
lemon
mix
well
with
a
bready
and
yeasty
middle
and
a
pale
malt
to
close
just
very
crisp
well
put
together
and
refreshing
great
representation
of
the
style
an
example
of
an
easydrinking
lager
done
right
pours
a
nice
golden
color
with
a
tall
white
head
and
visible
carbonation
throughout
good
retention
and
lacing
and
a
solid
cap
as
it
goes
down
the
nose
is
mostly
bread
with
some
light
graininess
in
the
background
and
some
faint
noble
hops
the
flavor
falls
along
the
same
lines
with
the
breadiness
of
the
nose
constituting
the
main
flavor
fading
into
a
bit
of
hop
bitterness
in
the
finish
light
body
with
good
carbonation
quite
drinkable
final
notes
the
holy
grail
of
light
lagers
big
malty
flavor
a
bit
of
hops
to
even
it
out
what
more
could
you
ask
for
poured
from
a
bottle
it
looks
bright
gold
has
plenty
of
carbonation
and
forms
a
good
head
smells
great
pretty
aromatic
for
a
lager
tastes
outstanding
similar
in
ways
to
hofbräu
this
is
certainly
a
beer
you
can
drink
heartily
classic
style
for
a
bavarian
lager
perhaps
easy
for
some
brewers
to
equal
but
certainly
hard
to
beat
i
will
definitely
get
this
again
d
absolutely
fantastic
this
is
a
great
brew
to
show
to
people
who
dont
think
they
like
good
beer
i
highly
recommend
this
to
all
who
are
seeking
to
dip
into
the
land
of
lagers
as
it
is
a
full
flavored
version
of
the
craplagers
most
of
us
grew
up
drinking
actually
i
will
shorten
that
to
i
highly
recommend
this
to
all
drinkability
for
a
lager
a
very
good
beer
perhaps
one
of
the
best
had
to
remind
myself
to
rate
within
the
style
the
mouthfeel
is
absolutely
perfect
it
goes
down
fullbodied
yet
absurdly
delicately
and
dries
the
mouth
a
perfect
amount
for
the
hop
zing
this
one
has
the
drinkability
is
also
very
good
theres
absolutely
no
issues
drinking
this
a
superb
timetested
lager
thats
absolutely
worth
your
time
highly
recommended
overall
although
the
hefeweissbier
gets
most
of
the
acclaim
this
brewery
is
certainly
no
onetrick
pony
although
the
first
impression
isnt
overly
impressive
this
is
a
terrific
beer
that
i
would
gladly
order
again
and
again
not
a
life
changing
beer
but
pretty
good
t
looks
light
but
doesnt
taste
it
fantastic
german
taste
nice
smooth
malts
and
then
a
snap
of
grassy
hops
followed
by
a
smooth
malty
finish
a
great
german
beer
drinkability
light
quaffable
sweet
not
light
on
the
lips
a
delicious
drink
to
sip
on
or
to
drink
up
drinkability
a
very
drinkable
and
tasty
beer
no
need
for
elaborate
flavors
just
simple
flavors
in
a
clear
and
pure
format
a
really
great
beer
and
something
i
could
drink
on
any
day
im
making
this
disappear
quickly
even
on
a
winter
night
i
figured
id
finally
review
a
classic
and
it
does
not
disappoint
ive
been
to
munich
but
before
my
beer
awakening
and
therefore
did
not
sample
this
at
the
source
if
im
ever
there
again
i
may
drown
in
it
an
excellent
helles
not
as
dry
as
a
pils
but
fuller
in
a
way
and
very
drinkable
pours
into
a
pint
glass
a
light
golden
color
almost
like
lemonade
with
a
large
bright
white
head
that
leaves
lacing
all
over
the
glass
the
nose
is
bready
with
a
bit
of
lemon
and
spice
the
taste
is
similar
with
a
metallic
tinge
to
it
very
easy
to
drink
im
not
a
huge
lager
fan
but
this
beer
is
great
subtle
and
flavorful
very
complex
but
easy
to
drink
definitely
worth
a
try
a
great
beer
to
keep
around
the
house
especially
in
the
summer
everything
about
this
appears
textbook
pale
yellowishstrawcolored
with
a
slight
haze
topped
with
a
beautifully
creamy
moderately
dense
white
head
a
grainy
aroma
reminiscent
of
white
toast
jumps
out
amidst
a
light
sweet
malt
base
with
an
essence
of
shrubby
noble
hops
very
inviting
with
a
quite
maltforward
taste
it
drinks
creamy
smooth
and
decidedly
fullbodied
for
the
style
cereal
grains
with
a
touch
of
honey
sweetness
highlight
whats
essentially
a
ubermalty
pilsner
flavor
brawny
and
hearty
surprisingly
filling
yet
refreshing
pours
a
pale
yellow
with
a
thin
white
head
a
hint
of
bluegreen
it
is
so
light
smells
of
generic
eurolager
taste
is
nice
lager
yeast
up
front
followed
by
a
smooth
grain
middle
but
the
finish
is
lifeless
and
there
is
a
very
poor
amount
of
bitterness
here
even
for
the
style
mouthfeel
is
average
average
carbonation
drinkability
is
good
its
a
pretty
light
and
refreshing
beer
but
it
is
quite
a
disappointment
in
comparison
to
the
other
weihenstephaner
beers
i
have
had
d
highly
drinkable
i
found
this
one
very
thirstquenching
very
refreshing
and
a
nice
brew
for
a
lazy
spring
day
very
crisp
this
tastes
like
a
generic
malty
euro
lager
to
me
at
least
it
doesnt
smell
like
one
sorry
d
as
i
neared
the
end
of
my
glass
this
beers
sweetness
did
begin
to
weigh
on
me
a
bit
so
i
dont
think
i
would
be
able
to
fully
enjoy
two
in
a
row
definitely
worth
a
try
though
and
im
sure
ill
be
returning
to
this
in
the
summer
months
this
is
a
quintessential
beer
of
beers
very
smooth
in
the
mouth
the
ample
carbonation
melds
hops
and
grain
into
a
mellow
traditional
lager
dry
with
a
slightly
fruity
tang
it
can
be
drunk
just
for
the
pleasure
of
experiencing
a
classic
brew
or
it
can
easily
accompany
any
meat
potatoes
type
dish
from
pretzels
to
pork
chops
a
lager
of
this
caliber
enhances
the
flavor
of
food
without
overpowering
it
very
pleasant
beer
not
my
cup
of
tea
typically
but
it
makes
for
a
very
nice
change
once
in
a
while
this
would
be
excellent
in
the
summer
so
easy
to
drink
a
must
have
for
lovers
of
this
style
weihenstephaner
has
had
hundreds
of
years
to
perfect
this
recipe
and
it
shows
all
the
beers
they
make
are
phenomenal
but
everything
other
than
the
hefe
goes
unnoticed
this
pours
a
mildly
cloudy
golden
color
with
a
tall
white
head
that
has
good
retention
carbonation
is
visible
floating
up
through
my
glass
the
smell
is
as
potent
as
other
beers
but
this
beer
still
smells
delightful
i
caught
a
whiff
of
sweet
grain
a
little
bit
of
apple
or
citrus
as
well
as
some
hops
the
fruity
smell
is
less
emphasized
in
the
taste
as
what
really
comes
through
strong
is
the
well
balanced
hop
and
malt
blend
the
mouthfeel
is
crisp
and
refreshing
and
drinkability
is
off
the
charts
another
nearperfect
creation
from
weihenstephaner
the
beer
pours
a
pale
gold
color
with
a
thick
frothy
white
head
that
slowly
fades
to
lacing
the
aroma
is
good
it
has
a
light
pilsner
and
vienna
malt
scent
thats
sweet
with
a
dry
nuttiness
the
hops
provide
a
faint
aroma
that
really
rounds
out
the
nose
the
taste
is
good
as
well
it
has
a
light
pilsner
malt
flavor
that
goes
down
easy
and
lays
a
solid
foundation
for
an
excellent
hop
bitterness
and
flavor
the
mouthfeel
is
fine
it
is
a
low
bodied
beer
with
adequate
carbonation
this
is
a
very
drinkable
beer
its
and
easy
drinking
with
good
hop
character
d
this
is
quite
flavorful
and
i
cant
get
over
the
beauty
of
this
beer
d
very
drinkable
lager
a
great
session
beer
this
was
a
great
beer
and
should
be
tried
by
anyone
drinkability
this
is
a
very
pleasant
drink
if
not
a
challenge
it
pairs
well
with
just
about
anything
and
is
eminently
sessionable
this
is
acceptable
beer
but
i
dont
for
the
life
of
me
see
why
it
scores
as
poured
a
huge
head
which
dissipated
to
nothing
fairly
standard
straw
color
and
fairly
typical
mild
taste
there
indeed
are
some
bitter
hops
but
nothing
special
im
hoping
some
of
their
other
labels
impress
me
more
d
you
cant
beat
a
good
helles
it
is
just
about
impossible
overall
this
is
a
relatively
simple
beer
but
that
is
whats
so
excellent
about
it
it
is
reinheitsgebot
beer
in
its
purest
form
and
because
of
the
simplicity
you
can
really
pick
out
the
flavors
in
it
nicely
in
many
ways
this
just
tastes
like
the
daily
bread
of
beers
this
beer
is
very
drinkable
and
would
pair
handsomely
with
a
big
yeasty
pretzel
or
bratwurst
in
a
big
bavarian
biergarten
by
the
way
the
bottle
i
had
was
labelled
original
bayrisch
mild
and
im
assuming
this
is
the
same
beer
on
second
thought
talk
about
a
good
way
to
wing
someone
from
macro
lagers
shows
that
a
lager
can
have
character
and
some
flavor
at
the
same
time
the
beer
doesnt
have
so
much
flavor
or
power
that
it
could
cause
anyone
an
issue
i
would
happily
buy
this
again
im
currently
loving
every
sip
of
it
this
is
perfect
as
i
sit
here
typing
up
a
report
for
class
drinking
a
worthy
beer
a
true
heffe
the
flavors
may
be
simple
but
this
is
a
nearly
perfect
lager
and
a
nother
example
of
what
makes
weihenstephaner
so
amazing
it
looks
great
it
smells
wonderful
the
flavor
is
simple
but
very
balanced
perfect
mouthfeel
and
i
want
to
drink
it
all
night
what
else
can
you
ask
for
drinkability
extremely
drinkable
this
beer
isnt
perfect
but
it
is
definitely
quaffable
and
fulfilling
oh
definitely
an
easy
beer
to
drink
and
enjoy
this
is
the
type
of
beer
youd
drink
at
any
occasion
want
to
impress
check
want
to
have
fun
and
drink
a
solid
beer
check
mate
what
a
lovely
yet
delicate
lager
an
underrated
as
well
as
overlooked
beer
as
the
spotlight
usually
shines
on
its
wheat
beer
brother
no
frills
and
fits
with
the
style
an
ease
to
quaff
back
a
half
liter
or
a
full
liter
for
the
more
ardent
lager
lover
i
had
no
problem
enjoying
this
a
real
classic
in
style
and
longevity
nice
flavors
but
a
little
weak
compared
to
many
other
beers
ive
been
drinking
lately
excellent
lawnmower
beer
or
bbqgrillout
beer
when
your
friends
come
over
to
hang
out
something
to
get
them
to
stop
wasting
their
money
on
bud
light
good
for
what
it
is
glug
glug
glug
d
i
could
throw
these
back
all
afternoon
and
evening
preferably
in
a
one
liter
stein
if
youre
looking
for
a
good
german
lager
start
here
drinkability
is
excellent
better
than
most
other
lagers
ive
tried
its
a
simple
but
very
well
done
brew
that
exemplifies
the
style
and
quality
ive
come
to
expect
from
weihenstephan
definitely
my
lager
of
choice
going
forward
pours
with
a
straw
coolor
and
with
a
thick
fluffy
head
that
stays
with
the
beer
overall
smell
is
floral
and
grainy
very
delightful
this
beer
has
one
of
the
crispest
hop
bites
of
any
helles
i
have
had
very
potenet
saaz
hops
are
complimented
by
a
rich
pilsner
malt
that
possesses
a
noce
clean
taste
that
has
some
grassy
notes
mouthfeel
is
drying
yet
pleasant
and
it
puts
a
smile
on
your
face
making
you
long
for
more
this
is
a
gold
standard
for
this
style
btw
neck
label
says
original
the
main
label
says
original
premium
i
dont
know
if
there
is
a
separate
product
or
not
i
find
the
smell
and
taste
hard
to
rate
kudos
for
a
bit
of
skunk
but
bleh
for
way
way
too
much
drinkability
is
very
good
as
with
most
lagers
though
i
do
not
feel
this
particular
beer
is
all
that
unique
enough
for
me
to
buy
again
definitely
a
good
german
lager
however
pours
a
clear
bright
gold
with
a
short
lived
white
head
aromas
are
almost
all
of
pils
malt
pleasantly
sweet
and
grainy
tastes
great
the
flavors
are
fairly
simple
sweet
clean
pils
malt
and
light
graininess
dominate
the
flavors
but
do
not
overwhelm
the
palate
light
grassy
hops
provide
restraint
to
the
sweetness
and
refreshment
to
the
palate
finishes
mostly
clean
with
a
light
sweetness
lingering
mediumlight
body
is
perfectly
weighted
and
is
perhaps
the
most
perfectly
carbonated
helles
lager
ive
ever
had
it
feels
just
right
this
simple
beer
is
exceptionally
well
crafted
im
still
getting
used
to
pale
lagers
that
dont
taste
like
butt
d
good
and
drinkable
pleasant
repeatable
but
not
amazing
also
my
first
of
beer
of
this
style
im
glad
i
enjoyed
it
also
happened
to
be
one
of
the
better
beers
for
a
hot
humid
new
england
night
in
midaugust
overall
one
of
the
best
and
easily
the
most
solid
lagers
you
could
ask
for
easily
accessible
and
deserved
of
a
place
in
everyones
fridge
its
from
weihenstephan
need
more
be
said
highly
recommended
seems
pricey
for
what
it
is
but
i
guess
when
you
travel
halfway
around
the
world
the
freight
costs
add
up
d
one
of
the
most
drinkable
beers
ive
ever
had
easily
can
have
several
of
these
and
have
no
problems
at
all
this
really
is
a
wonderful
beer
and
recommend
it
to
all
that
manage
to
see
this
review
carbonation
is
surprisingly
low
crystal
clear
light
gold
very
bright
an
easy
pour
produced
an
inch
of
fluffy
foam
that
while
it
settled
fairly
quickly
to
a
thin
layer
of
fine
bubbles
left
a
lot
of
streaky
lacing
stuck
to
the
sides
of
the
glass
sheets
of
bubbles
eventually
coated
the
glass
as
the
beer
quickly
disappeared
mild
aroma
with
notes
of
cereal
grains
pils
malt
light
lemony
and
herbal
hops
delicate
balanced
flavour
grainy
sweetness
a
bit
crackery
with
light
lemony
bitterness
and
grassy
hops
throughout
slightly
spicy
in
the
finish
delicious
light
bodied
with
ample
carbonation
some
crispness
and
dryness
this
stuff
is
good
refreshing
with
excellent
balance
id
be
happy
having
this
on
a
regular
basis
as
a
goto
lager
d
overall
i
was
quite
happy
with
this
beer
even
though
it
was
supposed
to
be
the
hefeweizen
i
was
searching
out
i
was
glad
to
try
this
definitely
not
my
favorite
munich
helles
but
still
a
great
beer
definitely
makes
me
want
to
visit
germany
and
try
as
many
of
these
as
possible
light
enough
to
be
very
drinkable
yet
flavorful
enough
to
keep
my
interest
this
would
be
a
great
beer
to
give
to
a
macro
drinker
to
turn
them
on
to
better
beer
its
flavor
is
quite
bitter
from
start
to
finish
although
it
is
light
is
well
defined
the
end
is
not
widespread
but
leaves
a
good
memory
in
the
throat
d
a
very
delicious
and
drinkably
refreshing
lager
and
i
really
dont
like
lagers
an
enjoyable
treat
after
a
long
day
of
work
in
the
hot
sun
smooth
finish
some
malt
lingers
very
drinkable
beer
definitely
a
classic
in
the
world
of
beer
oldest
brewery
in
the
world
right
well
this
is
a
lager
and
this
is
beeradvocate
so
i
should
probably
divide
all
the
scores
i
gave
this
beer
by
1
25
and
call
it
a
day
but
i
wont
because
lagers
rock
and
you
suck
just
like
a
golden
lager
should
this
goes
down
fast
relatively
low
abv
prevents
any
regrets
later
on
from
doing
so
d
exelent
i
will
take
6
of
this
ones
with
no
problem
at
thios
time
the
best
munich
lager
hell
that
i
have
try
d
low
abv
makes
this
one
a
great
sesson
beer
over
all
flavors
are
ok
not
the
best
ive
had
from
weihenstehaner
but
a
good
little
beer
drinkability
is
very
good
tasty
beer
nothing
much
to
complain
about
here
o
this
is
a
good
german
pils
but
i
prefer
their
worldclass
hefeweizen
i
would
recommend
this
for
the
american
pils
drinker
if
they
want
to
take
a
baby
step
toward
fuller
more
rewarding
beers
this
is
frankly
disappointing
after
their
awesome
korbinian
i
need
to
revisit
and
review
their
other
beers
also
drinkability
an
excellent
helles
i
was
trying
to
buy
weihenstephaners
weissbier
but
apparently
wasnt
paying
enough
attention
when
i
bought
it
this
is
still
a
very
good
beer
and
very
satisfying
overall
drinkability
easily
drinkable
and
the
hops
keep
this
beer
very
smooth
and
drying
and
leave
you
looking
for
next
sip
this
is
a
very
nice
beer
not
sure
complex
but
none
the
less
a
very
solid
example
mucich
helles
def
on
the
drier
end
of
the
spectrum
for
a
euro
lager
worth
looking
for
if
you
are
tired
of
super
dull
lagers
but
dont
want
go
to
complicated
nice
warm
weather
summer
beer
poured
from
500ml
bottle
to
a
clear
golden
yellow
color
with
a
nice
1
finger
head
with
a
great
pure
white
head
the
smell
is
grass
malts
some
floral
hops
smell
and
bread
it
smells
like
a
classic
pils
the
taste
is
crisp
and
pure
with
grass
and
malt
first
with
some
sweetness
followed
by
some
floral
noble
hop
taste
quite
refreshing
and
tasty
the
mouthfeel
is
medium
light
but
has
enough
malt
and
hop
to
let
you
know
that
this
is
a
well
made
helles
this
is
way
drinkable
and
really
crisp
and
refreshing
on
a
warm
spring
day
in
may
in
mpls
nicely
recommended
taste
is
crisp
and
smooth
with
a
really
quick
finish
and
a
light
amount
of
carbonation
its
got
a
light
sweetness
and
sharp
very
light
hop
bite
very
easy
drinking
o
perfect
example
of
the
style
i
could
drink
this
all
summer
the
flavor
is
very
crisp
and
clean
with
grainy
bready
malts
initially
the
hops
are
noticable
but
not
overly
so
the
initial
taste
is
that
of
toasted
malts
and
the
finish
is
slightly
sweet
mediumlight
bodied
well
carbonated
and
finishes
dry
quite
a
good
beer
and
very
easy
to
drink
i
can
definately
see
myself
drinking
several
of
these
in
a
sitting
d
average
drinkablty
d
this
beer
is
light
and
goes
down
easily
its
eminently
drinkable
and
a
good
example
of
the
style
very
simple
light
crisp
refreshing
and
drinkable
but
nothing
to
rave
about

however
a
faint
hops
presence
and
also
a
little
bit
of
grain
comes
out
in
the
flavor
profile
mouthfeel
is
lightbodied
with
an
easy
carbonation
and
a
clean
finish
easy
drinking
and
refreshing
on
a
warm
day
i
discovered
this
on
my
quest
for
a
great
pilsner
session
beer
a
standard
pilsner
appearance
but
with
a
more
hearty
mouthfeel
it
has
a
fantasic
earthyfunky
and
fruity
almost
floral
notes
with
hops
only
on
the
back
end
i
would
drink
this
often
this
is
my
new
favorite
beer
d
very
easy
to
drink
an
exceptional
lager
d
its
very
refreshing
and
easy
to
drink
a
great
choice
for
a
session
beer
definitely
a
very
easygoing
beer
crisp
mouthfeel
quite
drinkable
and
the
complexity
that
it
has
is
very
subtle
good
for
when
you
dont
want
the
beer
to
be
the
centerpiece
of
action
be
it
a
hot
afternoon
in
the
biergarten
or
with
an
equally
softpalated
meal
overall
not
bad
another
solid
german
brew
well
done
dvery
drinkable
sweetness
and
clean
flavors
make
this
a
good
beer
to
start
the
night
i
wasnt
expecting
a
lot
of
this
beer
since
i
presumed
the
brewery
put
all
of
their
effort
into
the
hefeweizen
wow
was
i
wrong
this
lager
is
great
golden
yellow
with
a
solid
head
the
complex
flavors
only
increase
with
the
intake
enjoy
in
large
qualities
or
buy
cheap
mass
produced
beer
instead
and
leave
this
stuff
for
people
who
can
appreciate
it
golden
pour
but
not
bad
seen
worse
decent
smell
not
super
impressive
but
wow
this
is
a
good
beer
nice
and
smooth
one
of
the
better
ones
i
have
had
good
with
a
light
meal
not
bad
with
the
maltiness
very
tasty
indeed
will
be
buying
this
one
again
d
very
high
this
is
a
beer
you
can
and
want
to
savor
over
the
course
of
a
fine
meal
perfect
with
onions
and
rare
beef
pours
slightly
cloudy
pale
straw
yellow
nice
foamy
head
that
dies
down
quickly
smell
is
grainy
like
a
silo
but
pleasant
and
toasted
almost
nutty
taste
is
malty
and
maltier
with
an
undercut
of
bitterness
that
lives
on
to
the
finish
mouthfeel
is
satisfying
and
not
prolonged
by
any
means
all
in
all
a
rather
good
beer
that
i
would
drink
a
few
of
much
respect
the
worlds
oldest
brewery
what
an
extraordinary
claim
to
fame
brewing
beer
since
1040
this
bavarian
brewery
makes
a
range
of
quality
interesting
beers
like
most
older
german
brewers
they
make
a
lot
of
noise
about
following
the
reinheitsgebot
that
fabled
bad
idea
that
fans
of
german
beers
still
claim
as
a
purity
law
that
old
law
of
1517
was
enacted
on
behalf
of
german
bakers
concerned
about
competition
from
brewers
for
wheat
like
many
halfbaked
laws
in
societies
the
world
over
why
they
didnt
just
pass
a
law
saying
wheat
is
for
bread
not
beer
we
may
never
know
since
then
its
morphed
grotesquely
into
a
purity
law
thankfully
german
brewers
managed
to
make
good
beer
in
spite
of
the
law
readers
of
this
site
probably
know
that
the
law
was
officially
repealed
in
1987
weihenstephaners
original
premium
has
a
crisp
clean
and
lightbodied
great
taste
it
pours
light
golden
with
a
foamy
white
head
its
aroma
and
taste
are
good
clean
malt
and
mild
hop
drinkers
of
the
beer
axis
of
evil
you
know
the
giants
should
give
this
style
and
this
brand
a
try
its
a
very
refreshing
every
day
kind
of
beer
that
can
satisfy
those
afraid
of
the
dark
but
with
enough
complexity
for
people
who
find
little
interest
in
cars
that
only
turn
left
mouthfeel
is
light
and
effervescent
with
a
dry
finish
every
lager
should
follow
this
formula
very
tasty
thanks
to
my
father
for
bringing
a
6
of
this
to
gods
country
the
bottle
claims
that
brauerei
weihenstephan
is
the
oldest
in
the
world
and
hence
the
drink
is
the
father
of
all
helles
lagers
if
not
all
beer
1040
ad
rock
on
notes
this
is
an
outstanding
easy
drinking
lager
the
only
big
negative
was
the
odd
yeast
floaters
that
filled
the
glass
after
i
poured
the
beer
anyway
it
didnt
take
anything
at
all
away
from
the
flavor
as
soon
as
i
took
my
first
couple
drinks
i
realized
this
beer
goes
down
super
easy
i
could
easily
finish
a
huge
german
steinmug
full
i
wont
get
this
again
probably
because
i
want
to
try
their
other
styles
this
was
good
though
and
i
would
grab
one
if
you
see
it
d
a
very
poundable
brew
perhaps
the
best
choice
for
das
boot
and
it
will
pair
with
nearly
anything
its
a
lager
so
its
yellow
and
a
little
watery
kinda
fizzy
its
better
than
most
lagers
which
i
guess
is
a
backhanded
compliment
cant
say
i
agree
with
its
overall
grade
here
good
price
though
as
are
all
their
beers
i
think
the
hef
is
just
a
lot
better
and
on
a
hot
summer
day
would
be
the
choice
d
great
goto
beer
drinks
very
easy
would
have
this
almost
everyday
desert
island
beer
great
with
rich
foods
perfect
alone
really
excellent
a
testament
to
what
clean
quality
ingredients
and
masterful
brewing
can
produce
sure
its
not
the
most
exciting
or
bold
style
but
sit
back
and
sip
one
and
the
delicate
complexities
are
really
impressive
d
a
direct
nofrills
pure
and
tothepoint
lager
good
example
of
the
style
d
extremely
drinkable
and
refreshing
d
very
refreshing
even
on
a
cold
winters
evening
a
classic
munich
helles
weihenstephaner
original
lager
is
an
exceptional
lager
it
is
tremendously
thirst
quenching
and
with
its
abv
makes
it
a
great
session
brew
hard
to
have
just
one

this
is
a
very
easy
to
drink
beer
that
one
could
have
all

long
and
not
get
bored

beer
here
drinkability
a
very
good
super
light
and
super
sessionable
lager
very
clean
i
could
have
several
i
thought
i
was
getting
the
hefeweizen
this
was
a
nice
surprise
wish
i
had
gotten
a
whole
six
pack
now
this
is
a
very
tasty
and
satisfying
beer
i
will
try
to
have
this
many
times
again
excellent
beer
very
crisp
and
refreshing
subtle
floral
and
citrus
flavors
and
goes
down
like
silk
beautiful
golden
color
and
a
nice
bright
smell
compliments
the
sturdy
but
overall
light
quality
of
this
beer
i
cant
imagine
anyone
not
enjoying
this
beer
and
wanting
to
have
another
overall
what
can
i
say
weihenstephaner
can
do
no
wrong
o
my
second
bottle
of
this
wasnt
mishandled
and
terrible
like
the
first
i
can
now
honestly
say
that
i
love
this
beer
if
only
american
adjuncts
tasted
this
good
worth
checking
out
if
you
want
a
good
german
lager
if
anything
this
is
a
really
drinkable
beer
that
would
be
perfect
for
a
summer
day
by
the
pool
light
crisp
flavorful
and
not
a
fillerupper
at
all
a
very
solid
beer
from
the
worlds
oldest
brewery
d
good
abv
and
very
drinkable
pretty
tasty
overall
especially
for
the
style
d
normally
im
not
the
hugest
lager
fan
especially
not
lighter
lagers
but
this
one
was
quite
the
exception
a
fairly
flavorful
beer
and
not
too
bad
price
wise
pours
a
very
clear
yellow
with
a
mediumsized
white
head
the
aroma
is
biscuitybready
malts
with
a
little
bit
of
hops
the
flavor
is
malty
with
hop
bitterness
at
the
end
you
also
get
a
little
bit
of
toastedcaramel
malt
in
the
flavor
very
tasty
thin
mouthfeel
and
medium
carbonation
d
very
good
great
session
beer
especially
in
hot
weather
d
very
easy
to
drink
d
this
beer
has
character
for
how
mellow
it
is
easy
to
drink
inexpensive
and
very
tasty
this
is
a
session
beer
if
i
have
ever
experienced
one
theres
no
wonder
they
have
been
in
business
for
almost
a
thousand
years
poured
from
a
brown
16
9
oz
bottle
has
a
cloudy
golden
color
with
a
12
inch
head
smell
is
mostly
malts
a
bit
sweet
taste
is
crisp
sweet
and
malts
pretty
tasty
feels
medium
bodied
in
the
mouth
and
is
a
good
session
beer
overall
this
is
a
fine
beer
so
im
trying
to
knock
off
a
few
styles
that
i
havent
reviewed
so
i
bought
this
and
a
dunkel
weisse
tonight
and
will
try
them
back
to
back
pours
a
clear
golden
color
with
a
three
finger
white
head
that
fell
slowly
leaving
incredible
lacing
aroma
is
sweet
bready
with
notes
of
lemony
noble
hops
flavor
is
light
some
bread
and
grassy
flavors
nonexistent
bitterness
basically
just
a
lightly
sweet
doughy
beverage
medium
bodied
ample
carbonation
an
easy
quaffer
overall
its
pleasant
and
easy
drinking
good
but
just
not
that
special
d
pretty
much
the
definition
of
a
quaffable
beer
whether
on
a
warm
summer
day
or
after
a
long
day
of
work
with
all
of
the
excellent
german
and
domestic
helles
lagers
on
the
market
whats
the
point
in
drinking
american
macros
unless
price
is
a
factor
this
beer
is
crisp
and
clean
with
an
abundance
rich
melanoidiny
bread
character
this
is
a
wellcrafted
brew
but
the
munich
helles
remains
a
difficult
style
for
me
to
get
into
due
to
the
light
funk
in
it
and
a
lesser
strength
all
around
d
not
bad
more
of
a
summer
brew
to
me
versus
drinking
it
in
cold
weather
i
believe
it
would
be
very
refreshing
drinking
it
outside
in
hot
weather
drinkability
this
is
pretty
good
its
something
i
could
drink
again
and
i
think
it
would
be
a
good
session
beer
my
father
doesnt
like
my
beers
because
they
taste
like
flowers
i
was
able
to
turn
him
on
to
this
though
i
generally
dislike
lagers
well
american
adjuncts
but
a
great
lager
this
is
a
very
nice
german
lager
especially
fresh
and
on
tap
d
refreshing
and
not
challenging
for
days
when
the
palate
needs
a
break
from
over
the
top
american
hops
id
drink
this
over
any
bmc
for
that
matter
there
are
many
superb
bavarian
lagers
out
there
and
there
are
those
which
are
painfully
average
this
offering
from
weihenstephan
is
unfortunately
the
latter
too
light
for
my
tastes
even
for
a
helles
lager
d
this
is
everything
i
want
in
a
lager
i
could
knock
down
several
of
these
poured
from
a
500
ml
brown
bottle
pours
a
pale
golden
with
a
medium
head
that
leaves
about
an
inch
of
foam
and
moderate
lacing
aroma
is
a
bit
less
detectable
than
expected
pretty
much
just
a
slight
maltiness
taste
is
a
very
subtle
malt
and
yeast
the
hops
are
barely
detectable
at
first
though
they
do
come
into
focus
more
in
the
aftertaste
mouthfeel
is
soft
and
well
rounded
as
befits
the
style
smoothness
gives
this
brew
a
good
drinkability
overall
a
decent
representation
of
the
munich
helles
style
d
a
tasty
lager
clean
and
well
made
w
mild
overall
effect
the
drinkability
is
good
and
would
go
best
with
sausage
since
it
has
enough
carbonation
to
cut
the
grease
a
very
good
helles
a
quality
drinkable
brew
drinkability
there
is
no
question
that
this
is
a
very
drinkable
beer
and
i
was
actually
surprised
by
it
being
5
1
because
it
had
the
body
and
mouthfeel
of
a
beer
a
great
deal
closer
to
4
disappointing
a
crisp
happy
hay
colro
withs
consistant
bubbling
but
a
light
bright
head
of
less
than
one
finger
the
aroma
was
a
pale
and
crystal
amlt
delight
with
hints
of
some
mineral
water
and
grass
the
taste
was
a
crisp
hay
field
of
pale
and
pilsner
malts
the
hard
water
makes
itself
evident
in
this
beer
very
good
though
helps
bring
the
hops
into
a
better
light
slightly
dry
but
other
very
crisp
and
refreshing
palate
overall
this
is
a
pleasing
german
lager
with
more
complexity
in
the
flavors
than
many
others
i
admire
how
it
tastes
slightly
unique
and
isnt
one
of
the
many
generic
lagers
that
characterize
this
type
of
beer
i
would
buy
it
again

you

no

second

by
my
german
brethren
and
they
sure
know
what
they
are
doing
for
its
category
it
is
a
surefire
winner
and
if
im
looking
for
a
light
lager
then
this
would
be
a
goto
d
about
as
stereotypical
a
munich
lager
youre
ever
going
to
fine
and
a
pretty
damn
good
one
at
that
this
beer
pours
a
pale

with
nice
carbonation
that
leaves
a
one

has

has
an
above

mouthfeel
with
nice
hints
of
real
maltymalty
hops
and
a
nice
creamy
finisha
very
nice
beer
thats
very
easy
to
drink
and
could
drink
all
night
drinks
very
easily
and
i
would
drink
this
all
day
and
all
night
wonderful
i
took
the
first
drink
and
it
matched
the
aroma
perfectly
very
well
balanced

and
at

it
has

ability
my
girlfriend
even
liked
it
get
a
hold
of
this
one
and
try
it
nice
nose
of
light
grassy
hops
and
some
well
balanced
malts
bit
of
yeasty
funk
and
light
lemon
rather
bright
and
clean
on
the
nose
taste
follows
and
offers
some
toasted
light
malts
and
a
slightly
coarse
texture
offers
a
long
finish
for
the
style
yielding
a
decent
feel
drinkability
matches
well
given
a
good
carbonation
that
keeps
through
the
pint
not
my
favorite
from
the
brewery
but
theyve
yet
to
dissappoint
the
body
is
light
and
crisp
with
carbonation
while
it
finishes
dry
this
is
a
highly
drinkable
beer
with
moderate
abv
overall
this
was
a
very
easydrinking
lager
and
is
one
that
i
could
session
on
a
hot
summer
day
definitely
worth
a
shot
drinks
very
nicely
goes
well
with
a
warm
humid
evening
but
not
so
fast
that
is
cant
be
enjoyed
in
the
process
the
fullness
of
the
carbonation
helps
slow
the
drinking
down
now
i
have
more
time
to
enjoy
it
drinkability
definitely
drinkable
a
great
beer
for
whatever
youre
doing
a
session
eating
etc
d
this
beer
is
smooth
and
crisp
making
it
quite
quafable
but
it
has
good
complexity
for
such
a
light
beer
making
it
a
good
session
beer
d
very
refreshing
covering
many

an

also
the
perfect
starting

d
super
easy

makes
a
great

cant
believe
it
took
me
this
long
to
try
it
d
decent
drinkability
guess
i
thought
it
would
be
a
little
better
than
it
was
it
didnt
wow
me
as
much
as

did

i
didnt
hate

probably
wouldnt

one
ill
be
revisiting
on
a
hot
day
would
love
to
have
this
fresh
on
tap
drinkable
and
enjoyable
recommended
mouthfeel
was
a
little
thin
definately
what
a
lager
should
taste
like
overall
this
is
my
first
munich
helles
lager
that
i
know
of
and
i
thoroughly
enjoyed
it
i
cannot
say
enough
about
this
beers
balance
it
is
very
easy
drinking
and
i
hope
to
drink
more
in
the
future
clean
crisp
well
bittered
and
balanced
i
am
a
fan
of
german
beers
and
this
is
a
great
example
of
the
fine
lagers
that
come
out
of
that
country
a
touch
more
spicy
in
the
hop
department
then
a
pilsner
which
is
ok
with
me
a
great
easy
drinking
brew
notes
my
first
weihenstephaner
out
of
the
5
different
bottles
that
i
bought
i
chose
this
one
first
since
it
is
the
original
now
i
am
even
more
motivated
to
try
the
remaining
ones
drinkability
is
as
high
as
it
gets
this
is
the
ultimate
session
lager
yes
its
a
little
bit
pricey
for
a
lager
but
its
worth
it
i
have
no
idea
how
fresh
my
sixer
was
so
id
like
to
get
my
hands
on
a
definitively
fresh
sample
either
way
this
is
a
kickass
lager
mouthfeel
is
good
it
has
a
mild
flavor
and
that
makes
it
an
easy
driinking
beer
recommended
tried
this
beer
from
my
cousins
pack
of
world
beers
pours
a
pale
yellow
with
good
head
retention
nice
taste
of
malt
and
a
little
bit
of
fruity
notes
i
felt
it
also
had
a
little
smokey
flavor
to
it
not
overwhelming
but
just
barely
noticeable
over
all
its
taste
is
very
well
balanced
the
aftertaste
was
a
little
bit
displeasing
but
i
think
i
will
we
buying
this
one
again
another
wonderful
beverage
from
weihenstephan
i
cant
get
enough
of
their

drinkablilty
i
find
it
almost
impossible
to
not
chug
this
its
so
refreshing
and
clean
tasting
i
really
want
one
of
those
giant
mugs
full
an
exceptional
example
of
the
helles
style
so
refreshing
you
simply
can
not
drink
only
one
and
stop
while
this
lager
is
ideal
for
the
summer
season
i
could
quaff
this
one
all
year
i
am
impressed
with
the
freshness
of
this
imported
low
abv
lager
im
going
to
have
to
try
this
one
again
after
a
while
and
see
if
i
find
it
as
appealing
as
i
have
this
evening
but
i
suspect
i
will
still
enjoy
this
one
the
second
time
as
much
i
have
upon
first
tasting
i
gotta
recommend
this
one
oh
boy
oh
boy
oh
boy
will
you
smell
that
so
much
what
a
good
german
beer
should
smell
like
traditional
golden
look
but
maybe
a
tat
on
the
lighter
side
the
head
is
something
else
foaming
up
nice
a
thick
and
high
that
makes
you
say
yum
taste
is
a
little
lacking
from
my
usual
german
brand
grading
apples
to
apples
german
beer
should
have
a
little
more
flavor
but
it
goes
down
extra
smooth
you
can
chug
this
beer
but
should
a
german
beer
be
like
that
notably
its
the
worlds
oldest
brewery
though
that
is
likely
misleading
since
it
is
likely
not
made
the
same
way
as
in
the
year
1040
its
more
likely
a
marketing
ploy
the
beer
seems
to
be
like
its
competing
with
american
lagers
instead
of
german
lagers
drinkability
the
most
drinkable
lager
i
have
had
to
date
very
good
i
guess
this
isnt
the
most
descriptive
review
but
my
opinion
should
be
clear
if
i
had
to
drink
one
beer
for
the
rest
of
my
life
this
would
be
it
oustanding
d
i
really
appreciated
the
on
draught
much
fresher
than
any
bottle
ive
had
heres
to
simplicity
nailed
perfectly
in
a
pint
glass
overall
a
wonderful
german
lager
crisp
and
refreshing
light
and
playful
a
great
beer
for
almost
any
occasion
might
also
make
a
decent
steppingstone
beer
for
those
who
need
such
a
brew
you
know
who
you
are
overall
the
mouth
feel
of
the
beer
is
carbonated
and
creamy
the
body
of
the
beer
is
light
and
the
finish
is
nil
this
is
an
okay
beer
there
is
no
spiciness
to
the
beer
kinda
surprised
was
hoping
for
more
poured
into
weizen
glass
from
bottle
crystal
clear
with
massive
fluffy
white
head
great
retention
and
lacing
smell
was
of
grain
yeast
and
some
biscuit
taste
was
heavy
on
the
biscuit
malt
dry
with
some
spice
and
grain
not
bad
for
a
lager
i
suppose
mouthfeel
was
light
and
crisp
overall
a
good
beer
appearance
on
pour
is
wonderful
very
light
color
very
clear
it
has
a
bright
white
three
finger
head
that
disapates
quickly
to
steady
lacy
thin
head
the
aroma
is
sweet
citrus
yet
rather
earthy
the
taste
is
not
strong
but
somewhat
hoppy
finishes
very
clean
and
somewhat
dry
leaving
me
eager
for
another
the
feel
is
very
smooth
and
pleasant
not
thin
carbonation
is
rather
high
but
pleasant
this
beer
is
very
drinkable

of
my
favorites

clear
its
actually
a

creamy
which
goes
well
with
the
taste

high

very
good
lager
from

of
my

german
brewers

bready

the

the
aftertaste
also
has
a
flowery

to
it
also
detected
a
slight
metallic
tinge
in
the
finish
but
not
much
good
light
mouthfeel
and
great
drinkability
definitely
a
crisp
and
clean
beer
made
with
quality
ingredients
d
ideal
for
a
helles
wish
some
place
kept
this
pour
on

excellent
come
on
bas
give
lagered
beers
some
love
weihenstephaner
continues
to
impress
they
couldnt
make
a
bad
beer
if
they
tried
while
this
is
not
quite
on
the
level
of
their
most
prestigious
beer
its
impressive
nonetheless
it
doesnt
possess
the
depth
or
character
of
hefeweissbier
vitus
or
korbinian
the
nose
and
its
body
could
use
a
little
attention
but
its
nice
allaround
otherwise
one
things
for
certain
you
cant
go
wrong
with
weihenstephaner
beer
im
repeatedly
impressed
and
occasionally
blown
away
by
their
beer
pour
is
golden
mild
sediment
with
a
decent
head
smell
is
a
bit
malt
a
bit
hops
earthy
apple
and
honey
palate
is
quite
balanced
and
very
mild
goes
down
very
well
but
wouldnt
say
its
either
more
so
malty
or
hoppy
apple
honey
earthy
straw
finish
and
clean
very
consistent
and
a
great
gateway
not
a
extreme
of
helles
characteristics
this
one
goes
down
very
easily
and
is
a
great
lager
d
a
good
summer
drinker
clear
light
straw
snow
white
head
aroma
is
bready
doughy
fresh
malt
and
light
grassy
hops
taste
follows
suit
on
balance
lightly
sweet
lightbodied
with
a
crisp
drying
finish
very
drinkable
good
example
of
the
style
would
make
for
a
nice
summer
quencher
and
gateway
beer
a
decent
unoffensive
lager
it
does
a
little
better
paired
with
food
than
served
alone
in
the
last
couple
days
i
have
drank
a
few
helles
lagers
and
this
one
take
the
cake
so
far
d
the
sweetness
builds
a
bit
which
brings
the
drinkability
down
a
bit
this
would
be
a
nice
beer
with
a
meal
d
a
fantastic
beer
d
an
outstanding
beer
that
never
fails
to
impress
this
is
about
as
good
as
it
gets
when
it
comes
to
pale
lagers
average
at
best
drink
cold
so
it
is
at
least
a
bit
bitter
i
expected
more
from
weihenstephan
d
firts
the
definition
of
drinkable
i
wish
more
american
beers
would
mimic
this
style
it
is
tasty
refreshing
and
drinkable
excellent
the
beer
is
poured
a
clear
straw
colour
with
a
great
white
fluffy
head
brilliantly
clear
in
the
nose
there
is
a
bit
of
hops
but
mostly
a
grainybready
flavour
its
not
very
big
on
the
nose
its
just
pretty
much
standard
the
flavour
of
the
beer
is
incredibly
smooth
with
a
nice
noble
hop
character
in
the
background
and
a
smooth
grainy
flavour
up
front
this
is
just
a
great
balance
between
lightness
hops
and
breadiness
mothfeel
is
light
as
expected
the
beer
is
also
quite
drinkable
pale
yellow
gold
and
crystal
clear
with
a
fine
rocky
white
head
that
leaves
nice
lace
on
the
glass
smells
of
toasted
grain
and
noble
hops
with
lemony
citrus
tastes
of
soft
lemon
and
fresh
bread
with
a
nice
hop
bittering
in
the
mostly
clean
finish
light
bodied
and
effervescent
classic
md
smooth
lowmoderate
carbonation
not
sticky
sweet
pleasant
easily
sessionable
not
particularly
tasty
but
a
great
alternative
to
a
light
american
style
lager
i
can
only
say
that
either
this
bottle
was
off
out
of
date
poorly
stored
or
brewed
under
license
by
unhygienic
fishmongers
i
cant
understand
how
my
review
is
so
out
of
whack
with
the
general
opinion
but
truly
the
bottle
i
had
was
appallingly
bad
weihenstephan
has
yet
to
produce
a
beer
that
doesnt
follow
its
style
to
the
t
no
wonder
their
school
is
the
most
renowned
brewing
school
throughout
the
world
i
will
be
purchasing
many
more
of
these
17oz
bottles
in
the
future
a
great
session
beer
that
surprises
and
makes
me
wanting
more
served
out
of
a
bottle
into
a
stella
glass
poured
perfectly
with
a
1
and
half
inch
head
clear
golden
color
head
stays
fairly
prominent
through
most
of
the
beer
this
beer
taste
amazing
its
one
of
my
favorite
bavarian
style
helles
lager
you
can
truley
taste
the
hallertau
hops
that
they
have
been
using
for
hundreds
of
years
the
mouthfeel
is
exceptionally
smooth
and
light
truely
meant
to
be
enjoyed
out
of
a
liter
mug
or
tall
style
glass
the
only
other
bavarian
style
lager
that
rivals
this
one
is
augustiner
ultimate
drinkability
ill
be
back
for
more
of
this
a
fair
amount
of
honey
throughout
the
palate
not
really
desired
slight
yeastyhoppy
bitterness
on
the
back
a
bit
of
a
sticky
mouthfeel
body
is
quite
thick
and
slow
with
very
little
carbonation
upon
drinking
this
is
overly
sticky
and
quite
unpleasant
when
im
drinking
a
lager
i
expect
some
sort
of
gas
having
said
that
the
palate
is
not
very
nice
yes
but
its
fairly
well
balanced
this
is
drinkable
enough
and
its
what
i
would
expect
given
the
style
d
really
exceptional
beer
i
like
the
reasonable
amount
of
carbonation
and
the
balance
of
bitterness
with
the
fruitiness
ill
absolutely
buy
this
again
pours
an
extremely
clear
light
yellow
colored
body
fizzy
not
cloudy
at
all
big
creamy
white
head
quickly
diminishing
very
malty
nutty
aroma
fresh
malty
smell
some
graininess
but
not
a
strong
aroma
overall
sweet
taste
some
nuttiness
refreshing
and
clean
tasting
tastes
much
better
than
it
smells
very
quaffable
some
breadiness
in
the
taste
wow
this
is
very
tasty
i
am
shocked
based
on
the
light
color
and
aroma
soft
palate
drinkability
drink
this
instead
of
coors
bud
miller
you
get
the
idea
refreshing
and
easy
to
drink
very
well
done
overall
great
mouthfeel
strong
carbonation
and
light
in
body
make
it
very
drinkable
as
well
im
liking
this
brewery
even
more
possibly
the
best
session
beer
that
ive
ever
tasted
its
crisp
dry
and
fresh
the
hops
give
the
beer
a
perfect
slightly
spicy
finish
the
malt
is
up
front
and
smooth
it
tastes
fresh
and
clean
this
lager
flavor
is
incredible
its
a
light
yellow
liquid
that
should
really
be
served
in
a
massive
stein
atop
which
i
can
picture
a
bubbly
white
head
that
leaves
plenty
of
lacing
this
beer
is
obscenely
drinkable
its
physically
difficult
to
take
a
small
sip
i
would
thoroughly
enjoy
drinking
this
beer
from
a
one
liter
glass
while
sitting
in
a
beer
garden
in
germany
sadly
i
can
only
imagine
how
good
this
beer
is
fresh
from
a
tap
at
the
brewery
drinkability
among
the
most
drinkable
available
smooth
flavorful
refreshing
and
delightfullly
sessionable
a
nice
easy
to
drink
example
of
the
style
that
has
a
good
amount
of
flavor
sessionable
and
i
could
knock
back
a
few
in
a
sitting
i
have
started
to
develop
an
appreciation
for
the
munich
helles
lager
and
i
think
this
stuff
is
damn
good
its
a
bit
expensive
for
what
it
is
and
i
think
spaten
is
almost
as
good
only
a
12
pack
can
be
had
for
about
the
same
price
as
four
bottles
of
this
salud
update
on

grabbed
up
a
bottle
and
its
perfectly
clear
the
flavor
profile
was
without
hops
in
the
beginning
but
as
the
brew
warms
the
hops
become
more
present
the
malt
character
is
stronger
but
still
manages
to
produce
a
nice
balance
drinkability
wish
i
had
more
a
great
example
of
why
germany
is
known
for
lagers
d
light
and
crisp
this
one
is
definitely
an
easy
drinker
i
would
definitely
recommend
anything
from
weihenstephan
that
you
can
get
your
hands
on
its
all
good
stuff
and
i
understand
that
the
brand
is
pretty
hard
to
come
by
im
lucky
enough
to
have
a
store
that
carries
a
lot
of
there
varieties
at
the
entrance
to
my
neighborhood

this
the

for

semi

a
great
lager
by
the
oldest
brewery
in
the
world
d
this
is
a
delicious
beer
that
goes
down
very
easy
very
tasty
in
its
own
right
and
super
quaffable
it
would
go
very
well
with
food
too
another
weihenstephaner
that
i
could
drink
until
the
beer
stops
flowing
light
welcoming
but
still
flavorful
and
satisfying
its
a
bit
pricier
than
some
of
the
other
bavarian
helles
lagers
available
in
the
states
but
if
you
love
the
style
as
much
as
me
you
might
want
to
give
this
one
a
shot
good
drinkability
clean
and
refreshing
and
crisp
with
a
smooth
aftertaste
this
beer
is
very
easy
to
drink
and
quite
delicious
even
though
i
am
enjoying
it
out
of
season
weihenstephaner
is
one
of
my
favorite
german
breweries
with
good
reason
mfd
i
think
i
should
mention
i
am
drinking
this
at
about
3
in
the
afternoon
i
couldnt
wait
untill
5
as
my
sister
says
its
always
5
oclock
somewhere
therefore
i
find
this
beer
amazingly
easy
and
pleasing
to
drink
though
a
bit
thick
i
do
not
find
this
to
be
a
detriment
only
it
holds
it
back
from
being
perfect
for
this
style
though
the
consistency
is
really
great
for
a
beer
and
does
indeed
make
me
want
to
drink
it
all
night
drinkability
very
good
tasting
great
mouthfeel
recommended
d
this
is
so
easy
to
drink
the
flavor
is
very
nice
although
nothing
outrageous
but
its
so
well
balanced
and
clean
that
it
has
to
stand
out
as
an
example
of
what
a
lager
should
be
overall
i
would
give
this
the
benefit
of
the
doubt
that
if
it
wasnt
skunked
then
it
would
be
much
better
the
taste
really
casts
a
shadow
though
it
was
very
bland
hopefully
a
rereview
will
fare
better
next
time
very
drinkable
an
excelent
session
brew
d
a
good
light
drinking
lager
that
was
cleanly
brewed
with
an
equally
clean
finish
respectable
session
drinkability
as
i
have
read
in
some
forum
posts
about
breakfast
beers
and
this
being
a
good
substitute
for
orange
juice
i
can
see
where
they
were
heading
towards
its
so
refreshing
and
crisp
and
well
done
that
it
can
be
enjoyed
slowly
or
at
a
faster
pace
because
the
flavors
are
so
upfront
and
clean
for
breakfast
i
wouldnt
drink
this
but
as
an
early
beer
for
a
starter
in
a
day
of
drinking
hell
yes
i
would
drink
this
all
day
long
d
my
tastes
certainly
slant
toward
ales
but
this
is
a
nice
malty
german
lager
with
just
the
right
touch
of
spicy
hops
to
help
provide
and
maintain
my
palattes
interest
could
easily
drink
many
more
of
these
if
it
werent
40
degrees
outside
and
had
a
second
and
third
bottle
in
the
fridge
bottom
line
a
killer
example
of
a
minor
style
quite
nice
quite
drinkable
but
simple
as
the
style
dictates
you
could
do
heaps
worse
go
germans
taste
malts
with
a
light
hoppiness
this
is
very
easy
drinking
such
a
perfectly
well
integrated
beer
pale
clear
straw
colored
with
a
shortlived
snowwhite
head
biscuty
slightly
medicinal
nose
balanced
taste
with
light
floral
notes
a
bit
of
spice
lots
of
grassy
flavors
at
the
end
all
embedded
in
a
bready
malty
package
its
crisp
and
clean
not
trying
too
hard
to
be
what
it
is
not
but
still
more
complex
than
the
few
others
i
have
tried
in
this
style
this
beer
pours
a
light
golden
color
with
aromas
of
some
malt
and
faint
hops
the
taste
starts
out
with
a
light
clean
hop
flavor
that
finishes
with
a
malty
creaminess
not
a
lot
to
it
but
still
one
of
the
better
german
lagers
i
have
had
i
would
rather
have
this
one
than
bitburger
or
warsteiner
going
to
be
tough
to
get
250
on
this
one
because
theres
really
not
much
to
it
pours
clear
gold
with
a
bubbly
white
head
faint
flowery
aroma
with
malt
and
light
hops
taste
is
a
lager
with
good
maltiness
and
no
bitter
metal
in
the
finish
good
nothing
special
could
drink
more
than
a
few
of
these
at
a
sitting
note
i
really
enjoyed
this
brew
but
listed
as
a
lager
it
could
easily
mistaken
as
either
a
pilsner
for
hefeweizen
by
any
of
the
senses
aroma
is
malty
and
fresh
but
with
an
underlying
aged
or
cooked
grain
note
on
the
palate
this
beer
is
crisp
flavorfully
malty
then
subtle
lemony
hoppiness
takes
over
in
the
finish
very
nice
balance
of
crispness
with
very
mild
bitterness
and
a
touch
of
starchy
sweetness
at
the
end
very
drinkable
and
refreshing
and
retaining
an
individuality
and
interesting
character
that
sets
it
apart
from
the
many
euro
and
american
lagers
out
there
d
very
easy
to
drink
a
few
of
these
im
sure
delightful
has
been
appended
to
many
other
reviews
of
this
beer
so
let
me
add
my
own
it
really
is
a
delightful
beer
very
bright
color
with
plenty
of
bubbles
and
a
loose
head
that
fizzes
with
a
nice
cloud
of
honey
lemon
and
lime
the
body
is
light
clean
and
bubbly
and
youll
find
no
shortage
of
citrus
and
honey
in
the
flavor
with
just
enough
hoppiness
to
give
it
a
bite
before
it
goes
down
somehow
weihenstephan
has
managed
to
stuff
a
sunny
may
afternoon
into
a
beer
bottle
had
this
with
a
plate
of
chicken
sausages
and
brown
rice
wonderful
an
instant
favorite
so
bavarian
so
damn
good
d
as
far
as
helles
goes
ive
never
been
a
huge
fan
but
this
offering
has
showed
me
what
the
best
can
be
like
fresh
grainy
flavors
and
body
and
bitterness
to
rival
czech
pilseners
this
is
much
much
more
than
just
yellow
beer
water
in
a
glass
this
beer
was
a
damn
good
surprise
when
i
had
it
at
a
tasting
recently
great
looking
clear
golden
color
the
malty
bread
bakery
aroma
and
taste
were
right
on
target
without
being
sweet
or
cloying
this
is
what
malty
lagers
should
be
all
about
perfect
balance
imo
presentation
aside
which
was
the
best
there
could
be
this
brew
was
fantastic
not
only
did
it
pair
awesomely
with
my
jager
schnitzel
and
spatzel
but
it
drank
so
well
on
its
own
before
during
and
after
dinner
if
im
hanging
with
a
lager
crowd
and
know
where
i
can
find
weihenstephaner
lager
ill
pick
it
up
in
a
heart
beat
a
perfect
example
of
a
benchmark
german
lager
weihenstephaner
original
pours
a
clear
yellow
color
with
a
sticky
and
fluffy
white
head
fruity
pale
malts
balanced
by
slightly
tart
hops
light
and
very
drinkable
classic
beer
i
highly
recommend
extremely
easy
drinker
a
most
pleasurable
german
lager
recommended
but
i
like
some
of
the
other
weihenstephaner
offerings
better
poured
into
a
seidel
typical
pale
gold
color
with
a
nice
crest
of
white
foam
that
leaves
chunks
of
lacing
everywhere
aromas
of
munich
and
pils
malt
with
only
the
slightest
hoppy
lemon
twinge
flavors
of
lightly
toasted
bread
honey
sweetness
soft
tart
lemon
a
touch
of
grass
and
a
fleetingly
metallic
finish
mouthfeel
is
standard
weihenstephaner
perfection
soft
and
crisp
with
no
wateriness
regardless
of
the
light
body
an
excellent
example
of
the
style
light
body
with
a
carbonation
that
is
not
harsh
a
very
refreshing
beer
a
good
helles
lager
a
really
good
lagerstyle
beer
im
just
beginning
to
drink
some
of
the
better
representatives
of
this
style
and
so
far
am
liking
them
nothing
spectacular
in
my
mind
but
a
great
beer
when
more
than
a
couple
are
on
the
horizon
d
damn
good
highly
drinkable
and
not
overly
bland
as
seems
to
be
par
for
the
helles
style
one
of
the
most
remarkable
aspects
of
this
brew
is
its
complete
lack
of
wet
dog
and
metallic
flavors
something
that
i
find
always
creeping
into
lagers
and
pale
lagers
especially
well
done
palate
is
toasty
cracker
like
with
soft
malt
sweetness
enough
hops
to
make
it
have
a
gentle
bite
more
like
a
nibble
and
it
is
light
bodied
this
one
is
amazingly
refreshing
drinkable
and
above
all
else
for
a
lager
like
this
it
has
no
flaws
simply
one
of
the
very
best
in
its
style
md
overall
not
a
bad
beer
but
not
really
one
of
my
favorite
styles
nothing
really
stood
out
to
me
d
i
could
drink
a
lot
and
like
it
decent
taste
good
finish
in
the
mouth
clean
and
dry
ps
any
of
you
who
review
these
lagers
and
pils
give
them
a
d
complaining
about
the
weak
or
bland
flavors
stop
reviewing
the
style
if
you
dont
like
it
and
dont
want
to
be
objective
yes
this
isnt
a
double
bastard
we
know
go
fuck
yourselves
drinkability
is
supa
dupa
this
is
an
enjoyable
change
of
pace
for
me
too
bad
i
waited
until
the
end
of
the
summer
to
try
it
very
good
pours
a
nice
clean
clear
pale
yellow
with
lots
of
carbonation
and
a
good
fluffy
white
head
that
lingers
unusually
long
for
a
lager
nose
is
slight
skunk
and
good
graininess
very
nice
taste
with
grain
light
fruit
some
slight
spice
a
little
bit
of
skunkiness
and
a
touch
of
slight
cream
some
grass
or
straw
as
well
mouthfeel
is
nice
and
not
too
thin
or
overcarbonated
drinkability
is
quite
good
but
could
be
better
although
still
an
excellent
sessionable
lager
overall
a
very
pleasant
lager
and
one
i
would
certainly
revisit
great
for
the
summer
grill
or
moose
camp
in
the
fall
good
beer
d
this
is
the
first
german
lager
i
have
tried
and
was
pleasantly
surprised
this
was
very
simple
yet
delicious
pours
a
clear
light
gold
or
yellow
color
with
a
thick
fluffy
white
head
which
settles
down
but
i
still
get
some
nice
lacing
aroma
is
malty
with
a
lot
of
fresh
cut
grass
the
beer
tastes
ok
theres
nothing
foul
about
it
but
i
wouldnt
call
it
good
either
a
mix
of
grassy
semisweet
malts
and
hops
and
the
beer
finishes
a
little
sour
and
dry
im
sure
ill
have
a
beer
from
this
brewer
again
but
itll
be
their
hefe
i
buy
not
this
one
it
poors
a
golden
straw
color
with
a
large
white
rocky
head
that
last
very
well
and
left
some
patchy
lacing
the
smell
is
of
light
grains
and
light
sweet
almost
honey
malts
with
some
mild
hop
aromas
including
grass
spicey
and
slight
lemon
tatse
is
malts
all
the
way
upfront
very
sweet
yet
light
malts
with
a
dry
crisp
finish
showing
off
the
noble
hops
the
mouth
feel
is
medium
in
feel
and
carbination
with
a
dryfinish
that
leaves
you
ready
for
more
and
also
makes
it
very
drinkable
this
one
like
most
great
helles
is
straight
forward
and
right
there
with
no
hidden
secrets
just
a
very
well
crafted
beer
if
you
a
fan
of
helles
pick
up
a
6pk
of
this
it
wont
disappoint
this
is
the
beer
i
will
reach
for
if
i
want
to
quench
my
thirst
and
get
drunk
note
drink
this
chilled
i
let
this
warm
up
and
some
not
so
inviting
minerally
and
off
flavors
showed
up
blech
this
would
make
a
great
session
beer
although
i
prefer
the
weihenstephaner
dunkel
d
not
bad
something
different
for
me
recently
refreshing
and
enjoyable
would
drink
on
a
hot
day
again
without
an
issue
overall
this
is
drinkable
and
decent
for
the
style
but
not
really
up
to
the
other
beers
under
the
weihenstephaner
brand
d
well
balanced
with
a
great
flavor
what
else
can
you
ask
for
by
far
thee
best
munich
helles
style
lager
that
ive
had
to
date
good
alcohol
level
and
great
flavor
make
for
a
great
session
lager
imo
the
taste
is
clean
with
a
good
malt
profile
all
the
way
through
until
the
hotness
leaves
you
with
some
parting
gifts
it
is
well
carbonated
as
the
hundreds
of
tiny
bubble
release
through
the
clean
yellow
color
overall
it
is
the
original
for
a
reason
definitely
one
of
the
best
lagers
for
me
to
date
dumped
the
12
oz
bottle
into
a
5l
mug
and
got
a
whopper
of
a
head
that
quickly
sank
down
to
a
thin
foam
on
top
its
a
clear
straw
color
with
some
golden
hues
smell
of
copper
and
loam
with
a
hint
of
apple
taste
is
crisp
and
metallic
with
a
nice
hop
bite
to
coming
after
the
apple
tones
with
a
breath
of
alcohol
in
the
finish
it
feels
clean
and
watery
in
the
mouth
quite
refreshing
this
is
my
summer
beer
and
im
loving
it
d
what
a
great
beer
and
with
such
a
low
abv
this
is
easily
sessionable
pour
is
a
pale
straw
yellow
with
a
tiny
film
on
top
and
little
to
no
lacing
aroma
is
weak
and
a
bit
grassy
mouthfeel
is
thin
and
sticky
flavor
is
average
at
best
but
leaning
more
towards
bland
overall
this
beer
is
a
major
bummer
considering
their
wheat
beers
are
much
better
than
this
offering
next
time
i
will
pass
d
easy
to
drink
goes
down
like
that
of
a
macro
beer
body
medium
with
light
carbonation
and
a
slippery
mouthfeel
i
did
not
want
to
finish
it
very
nice
helles
this
is
a
very
drinkable
beer
i
think
that
if
i
needed
to
sit
down
and
drink
all
day
well
call
that
day
saturday
this
would
be
a
perfect
beer
for
the
ocassion
the
taste
is
very
good
very
smooth
very
refreshing
this
is
a
crisp
beer
reasonably
well
balanced
a
bit
drying
in
the
finish
a
slight
bit
of
citrus
a
little
bit
of
the
husky
grain
emerges
as
well
there
is
a
sweetness
not
overpowering
in
the
mid
section
that
segues
into
a
drier
finish
this
is
a
light
bodied
beer
that
has
a
slight
spicy
hop
bite
in
the
finish
as
well
an
enjoyable
beer
very
drinkable
well
worth
seeking
out
it
is
a
hot
summer
day
as
im
writing
this
review
and
weihenstephan
is
exceptionally
befitting
lchaim
pours
a
glowing
pale
golden
color
lively
carbonation
a
healthy
white
head
with
excellent
retention
rises
up
and
remains
light
and
clean
scents
a
wellbalanced
act
between
hops
and
malt
with
malts
seeming
to
have
the
edge
in
the
nose
taste
is
quite
thirst
quenching
a
delicate
sweetness
from
the
malt
that
is
never
too
overdone
nice
nibble
from
the
hops
ever
so
gentle
somewhat
grassy
leafy
hop
presence
and
a
splash
of
lemon
zest
some
biscuity
bread
is
also
present
very
soft
and
smooth
going
down
with
a
light
crispness
to
it
entirely
too
drinkable
i
would
have
more
than
just
another
there
is
not
much
you
can
say
wrong
about
this
one
hits
the
nail
on
the
head
for
what
it
should
be
the
beer
did
not
have
too
much
carbonation
as
noted
above
and
i
think
that
i
have
learned
as
of
late
that
i
really
enjoy
the
german
beers
overall
this
is
a
great
beer
and
i
will
try
to
keep
this
in
stock
in
my
fridge
crystal
clear
yellow
with
a
slowly
fading
white
head
clean
sweet
pale
malt
aroma
fresh
and
doughy
delightfully
soft
pilsner
malt
flavor
sweet
with
a
light
leafy
hop
bitterness
medium
bodied
and
smooth
due
to
the
somewhat
lowish
carbonation
yummy
thats
a
damn
good
lager
i
wish
it
wasnt
so
expensive
id
buy
it
by
the
case
for
the
summer
months
a
wonderfully
easy
to
drink
beer
that
is
perfect
for
the
summertime
a
lager
that
hits
the
spot
d
this
beer
goes
down
easier
than
my
date
on
prom
night
easy
drinking
brew
that
has
amazing
flavor
and
still
refreshes
this
is
a
good
plain
drinking
brew
on
any
day
happy
day
mfd
a
quality
beer
great
summertime
choice
drinkability
wasnt
great
i
almost
finished
the
beer
but
when
it
went
flat
during
the
last
eighth
or
so
of
the
beer
i
had
no
desire
to
finish
off
the
beer
as
the
taste
didnt
appeal
to
me
i
have
no
desire
to
hunt
down
this
beer
to
drink
especially
when
i
could
spend
the
same
money
on
a
beer
i
like
overall
a
decent
summer
drinker
thats
light
enough
to
enjoy
on
a
hot
day
as
a
lager
it
still
exhibits
a
nice
clean
balance
between
the
malt
and
hops
d
my
second
beer
from
this
brewery
and
its
simply
outstanding
i
think
i
have
found
my
quintessential
summer
session
brew
it
went
down
in
three
large
gulps
after
the
few
initial
sips
it
took
to
assess
flavor
poured
into
an
oversized
wine
glass
with
a
small
fingers
worth
of
white
head
watery
golden
yellow
color
and
extremely
clear
with
trace
amounts
of
bubbles
slowly
rising
from
the
bottom
of
the
glass
it
had
an
earthy
grain
and
wheat
type
of
odor
to
it
this
one
also
tasted
of
grains
as
well
but
did
have
a
slight
hop
presence
near
the
end
easy
drinking
with
a
light
and
almost
fluffy
mouth
feel
i
was
pleased
with
my
purchase
a
quintessential
beer
that
i
couldnt
even
begin
to
appreciate
or
fully
enjoy
before
i
had
treated
myself
to
a
few
years
of
reading
tasting
and
reviewing
truly
tasty
golden
it
has
a
huge
white
head
that
steadily
shrinks
to
a
permanent
1inch
head
and
leaves
very
nice
lacing
the
aroma
is
wodnerful
and
fullbodied
bread
honey
light
pine
flowery
citrus
the
taste
is
outstanding
with
a
strong
bready
quality
grain
pine
honey
hints
of
lemon
and
hay
sweetish
and
fullbodied
faintly
oily
with
a
light
balancing
bitterness
its
incredibly
drinkable
yet
very
tasty
with
full
clean
even
flavours
and
light
interesting
complexity
a
very
good
example
of
the
style
also
a
great
lawnmower
beer
with
good
complexity
simply
wunderbar
very
drinkable
and
will
look
to
but
these
more
often
im
not
sure
why
i
have
avoided
this
beer
for
so
long
but
it
truly
is
a
world
class
lager
clean
yet
flavorful
with
an
amazing
drinkablility
you
cant
go
wrong
here
d
very
good
drinkability
a
nice
light
lager
that
is
just
a
pleasing
light
lager
this
beer
poured
a
nice
golden
color
with
about
a
one
finger
head
the
head
lasted
only
a
minute
or
so
good
lacing
though
smell
was
good
with
malt
and
hops
taste
was
very
good
sweet
and
malty
hint
of
citrus
and
the
right
amount
of
hops
on
the
back
of
the
mouth
was
very
crisp
mouthfeel
was
good
light
and
crisp
drinkability
of
this
of
this
beer
was
good
it
was
crisp
and
refreshing
seems
like
a
good
summer
beer
this
might
be
my
new
bbq
beer
this
is
definitely
one
of
those
less
is
more
beers
pours
a
light
gold
with
a
moderate
head
both
smell
and
taste
are
very
earthy
and
bready
there
is
alot
of
citrus
in
the
taste
as
well
which
is
more
subtle
than
its
bread
counterpart
this
beer
is
very
clean
and
crisp
highly
recommend
especially
for
the
summer
months
awesome
brew
that
goes
down
smooth
can
likely
match
any
meaty
food
and
is
quite
refreshing
one
of
those
true
essence
of
beer
brews
poured
into
a
pils
glass
and
received
a
foamy
onefinger
head
aided
by
good
carbonation
stuck
around
for
awhile
and
left
some
lacings
on
top
of
a
golden
body
extremely
hoppy
and
grassy
with
some
lemon
piercing
through
on
top
of
something
sugary
a
great
hop
presence
is
noticeable
and
there
are
some
spices
that
hit
the
tip
of
the
tongue
a
mediumbodied
beer
that
goes
down
smoothly
but
with
a
nice
dry
aftertaste
there
are
some
bread
malts
or
something
in
there
plus
there
may
have
been
some
light
fruitiness
and
sweetness
i
e
apples
and
honey
not
my
favorite
style
or
perhaps
i
wouldve
enjoyed
the
complexities
more
but
id
still
recommend
this
to
any
beer
drinker
and
look
forward
to
buying
another
one
excellent
carbonation
crisp
and
refreshing
could
suck
em
down
at
the
hofbrau
all
day
long
i
could
drink
this
stuff
all
day
it
seems
to
be
different
to
the
helles
from
munich
maybe
more
like
a
beer
from
the
schwarzwald
either
way
i
love
the
fact
its
widely
available
in
perth
d
a
fantastic
lager
beer
i
need
to
buy
this
beer
more
especially
during
the
summer
months
it
does
get
a
bit
acidic
feeling
hurting
drinkability
but
brauerei
weihenstephan
is
batting
1
000
in
my
book
maybe
the
crappy
tigers
can
take
a
lesson
this
poured
a
light
yellow
color
with
beautiful
fluffy
head
that
lingered
forever
aroma
was
sweet
malt
taste
was
malty
and
also
of
grain
was
balanced
a
nice
hops
presence
the
mouthfeel
and
carbonation
were
perfect
the
drinkability
of
this
one
is
at
the
top
of
the
scale
a
nice
sessionable
lager
not
complex
and
not
meant
to
be
an
excellent
session
beer
and
one
to
give
those
who
may
not
like
beer
or
only
drink
macro
crud
just
wonderful
d
wow
now
i
see
why
people
make
a
fuss
abou
weihenstephaner
beers
this
is
such
a
smooth
drinkable
yet
distinctive
beer
that
sets
a
very
high
bar
for
lagers
bright
but
mild
with
lower
carbonation
for
the
style
which
allows
that
delicate
buttery
flavor
to
come
through
semidry
in
the
finish
with
a
lower
abv
which
provides
high
drinkability
a
well
rounded
and
unique
brew
mouthfeel
is
light
bodied
yet
slightly
sticky
on
the
lips
this
is
an
ok
beer
i
dont
know
about
this
one
ive
tried
weihenstephaners
beers
before
and
never
had
a
problem
i
might
go
back
and
try
again
with
this
this
is
probably
my
new
light
lager
of
choice
good
thing
the
restaurant
that
has
it
on
tap
is
only
15
minutes
away
d
this
is
a
very
nice
lager
everything
from
weihenstephaner
is
quite
good
d
wow
i
want
to
kick
myself
because
i
only
bought
one
twelve
oz
bottle
d
taste
a
little
like
they
use
the
same
yeast
all
their
brews
beyond
that
a
tasty

as
a

a

more
very

no

this
brewery
is
still
around
pours
a
very
crystal
clear
light
straw
color
with
a
dense
white
fluffy
head
and
medium
visual
carbonation
the
aroma
is
quite
mild
with
sweet
grain
and
slight
noble
hop
aroma
coming
through
a
little
vegetal
note
coming
through
from
pils
malt
but
nothing
bad
on
the
palate
it
comes
through
first
sweet
then
hits
the
side
of
the
mouth
with
a
dry
tartness
hop
bitterness
is
totally
in
check
with
the
light
toasty
flavors
of
the
pils
malts
and
a
little
apple
fruitiness
from
the
yeast
carbonation
and
mouthfeel
are
both
according
to
style
medium
and
a
medium
low
respectively
overall
a
nice
example
of
the
style
nearly
textbook
but
what
else
would
you
expect
from
the
worlds
oldest
brewery
drinkability
is
great
its
not
really
my
style
but
for
what
it
is
its
stellar
give
me
one
of
these
over
a
heineken
any
day
of
the
week
preferably
a
week
during
the
summer
on
a
scenic
vista
overlooking
the
rhine
cheers
this
wasnt
awful
but
it
was
in
the
end
droll
nothing
about
the
olfactories
grabbed
me
and
wowed
decent
drinkability
is
great
this
is
an
example
of
a
great
lager
brew
that
keeps
things
light
but
does
not
sacrifice
lightness
for
lack
of
flavor
cheers
carbonation
is
lower
than
the
spritzy
beverage
expected
but
quite
enjoyable
body
on
the
light
side
and
drinkability
is
nearly
off
the
charts
for
me
unfortunately
only
the
1809
is
currently
distributed
to
kansas
otherwise
weihenstephan
would
be
a
regular
in
my
fridge
nice
golden
color
with
a
decent
head
thatssticks
to
the
glass
and
yet
is
fluffy
the
smell
is
good
to
average
but
has
a
nice
smell
and
a
clean
crisp
to
it
the
taste
is
great
smooth
as
silk
and
is
still
good
as
it
warms
this
would
be
a
great
session
beer
worth
a
try
does
not
appear
to
be
a
dumbed
down
export
model
poured
into
a
pils
glass
this
beer
lights
up
nicely
pale
gold
and
crystal
clear
with
nice
active
carbonation
and
a
sticky
and
lacy
one
inch
head
that
fades
to
a
cap
in
a
minute
or
two
the
smell
is
nice
an
clean
with
touches
of
malty
and
grassy
sweetness
here
and
there
the
taste
at
first
is
a
mellow
and
buttery
green
apple
that
warms
into
a
nice
bready
sweetness
im
not
really
a
fan
of
the
style
personally
but
this
is
still
a
very
nice
beer
smooth
and
light
on
the
palate
with
an
infusion
of
carbonation
that
tickles
the
tongue
toasted
grain
notes
and
a
lemony
floral
hop
presence
round
out
the
flavors
not
a
very
complex
lager
but
definitely
a
very
solidly
constructed
brew
easy
drinking
and
quite
tasty
had
in
my
weihenstephaner
glass
this
beer
poured
a
clear
straw
color
and
formed
a
nice
foamy
white
head
that
left
latticed
lace
as
it
subsided
a
small
amount
of
carbonation
is
present
an
aroma
of
malt
bread
and
grass
the
flavor
was
of
grain
biscuts
and
pepper
it
was
a
fairly
light
body
with
a
nice
crisp
finish
to
it
dhigh
did
not
expect
the
sweetness
in
a
golden
lager
but
would
go
back
for
more
d
goes
down
smooth
may
drink
again
drinkability
very
easy
to
drink
nice
and
refreshing
i
have
had
other
from
this
company
and
they
are
great
d
tasty
goes
down
easily
not
filling
at
all
the
kick
is
ok
if
im
going
to
go
with
a
light
german
lager
this
would
be
a
pretty
good
choice
i
could
certainly
drink
several
of
these
mouthfeeldrinkability
the
mouthfeel
is
as
perfect
as
could
be
liquid
silk
transforming
to
a
foamy
sea
that
finishes
with
sublime
elegance
although
this
isnt
my
goto
beer
for
this
style
its
presentation
and
tasting
was
a
rewarding
experience
i
was
surprised
by
this
one
but
i
guess
not
really
considering
its
from
the
oldest
brewery
in
the
world
i
considerd
it
very
drinkable
and
i
could
have
several
of
these
in
a
row
without
growing
tired
this
is
the
first
weihenstephaner
ive
tried
and
certainly
wont
be
my
last
d
good
taste
and
smoothness
make
this
easy
to
drink
its
one
of
those
beers
that
you
can
drink
all
night
pours
a
bright
golden
color
with
lots
of
creamy
white
head
that
sticks
around
for
a
while
smells
of
noble
and
cascade
hops
and
slightly
yeasty
taste
is
also
very
hoppy
citrusy
and
noble
theres
lots
of
munich
and
lager
malt
flavor
there
as
well
very
tasty
mouthfeel
is
a
little
creamy
and
a
little
fizzy
theres
some
scraping
on
the
tongue
overall
its
a
very
drinkable
beer
i
wouldnt
mind
having
more
ill
consider
this
beer
a
delicacy
after
tasting
a
lot
of
light
american
lagers
recently
this
beer
opens
with
a
hopdominant
nose
of
noble
hops
releasing
a
boquet
of
earthy
grassy
herbal
notes
a
sturdy
backbone
of
pilsner
malts
offer
support
for
the
hops
while
offering
little
in
terms
of
sweetness
or
graininess
any
pilsnertype
dms
or
acetaldahyde
are
swallowed
by
the
hops
delicate
malt
textures
bleed
well
into
the
dryness
of
the
hops
and
mild
alcohols
finishes
light
crisp
and
with
a
lingering
hop
flavor
very
nice
beer
but
perhaps
a
bit
too
hopdominant
to
be
considered
balanced
weihenstephaner
original
pours
from
a
brown
twelve
ounce
bottle
as
a
golden

with
a
thick
white
head
that
persists
stubbornly
the
aroma
is
malty
with
a
hint
of
citrus
and
a
hint
of
hops
the
taste
is
very
well
balanced
toasty
malt
and
hops
merge
beautifully
there
is
also
a
hint
of
citrus
flavor
exceptionally
easy
to
drink
one
of
the
best
lagers
ive
ever
tasted
this
brew
pours
to
a
golden
yellow
color
with
a
fair
sized
head
which
has
left
a
fair
amount
of
lacing
down
the
side
of
the
glass
the
aroma
is
dominated
by
malt
with
some
light
citrus
like
flavors
but
not
from
hops
i
believe
more
of
a
lemon
flavor
the
taste
is
nice
i
will
say
that
though
i
feel
that
this
is
a
good
beer
i
think
it
is
probably
the
last
favorite
that
i
have
tried
from
weihenstephan
i
will
say
though
that
this
brew
exceeded
my
expectation
and
would
be
one
that
i
would
stock
in
my
fridge
especially
during
the
warmer
months

pleasant

but
lacks
a

puts
the
overall
where
it
is
hemming
at
the
average
while
the
promise
of
its
beginning
is
unfulfilled
d
would
make
a
great
session
beer
but
personally
id
prefer
something
more
substantial
overall
a
soso
pils
clean
and
light
but
rather
unremarkable
d
a
fantastic
helles
vom
fass
could
drink
this
all
day
in
the
biergartens
of
munchen
if
only
i
was
there
now
overall
one
of
the
best
lagers
ive
had
an
allaround
solid
choice
that
can
make
an
excellent
beer
choice
for
when
you
want
to
have
a
bunch
or
when
you
just
want
to
wash
down
your
bratwurst
this
is
the
ultimate
example
of
what
a
lighter
colored
lager
should
be
edit
as
this
beer
warms
it
develops
a
wierd
metallic
taste
much
better
cold
as
of
now
this
is
probably
the
finest
lager
i
have
ever
tasted
the
freshness
and
lack
of
skunky
tastes
put
it
leagues
ahead
of
most
mainstream
lagers
the
price
is
on
the
high
side
but
not
unreasonable
considering
the
quality
there
are
certainly
more
interesting
german
beers
out
there
but
this
one
reeks
of
quality
and
makes
for
very
enjoyable
drinking
very
drinkable
might
become
a
regular
session
beer
for
me
i
was
very
suprised
by
the
quality
of
this
brew
have
had
bad
luck
with
bottles
from
germany
in
the
past
recomended
light
towards
medium
bodied
this
one
is
so
smooth
crisp
and
refreshing
that
it
just
begs
for
more
a
surprise
offering
that
in
my
opinion
matches
that
of
their
hefeweizen
this
was
one
of
the
best
blonde
lagers
ive
ever
tasted
will
it
be
enough
to
win
the
weihenstephaner
invite
their
dunkelweizen
will
be
the
last
one
on
tap
coming
up
later
d
quite
drinkable
perfect
summer
beer
that
can
be
drunk
any
time
of
year
d
nothing
remarkable
in
the
smell
or
taste
just
nicely
balanced
with
enough
character
to
make
it
a
highly
drinkable
beer
cant
wait
for
the
warmer
weather
to
get
stuck
into
more
of
these
d
a
decent
oldworld
beer
they
deserve
credit
but
maybe
my
buds
are
spoiled
by
the
big
flavor
us
versions
a
sessioner
for
sure
tinge
of
sweet
malt
is
appreciated
and
balancing
finish
is
dry
and
short
good
stuff
but
the
flavor
level
needs
to
be
more
bold
i
honestly
thought
it
was
going
to
be
skunked
but
i
guess
that
i
misread
the
pull
date
i
was
wrong
about
this
and
im
glad
i
was
great
helles
can
definitely
have
plenty
of
these
in
one
night
great
beer
for
bbqs
and
relaxing
by
the
pool
overall
a
good
and
drinkable
lager
simple
and
straightforward
when
i
read
the
reviews
from
other
bas
i
had
to
relook
at
the
bottle
to
see
if
i
was
drinking
the
same
thing
several
said
theres
was
cloudy
or
hazy
mine
was
kristall
klar
and
a
pale
straw
colour
i
got
no
phenolics
that
some
reported
but
a
malty
grassy
aroma
and
similar
taste
there
was
a
crisp
sparkly
mouthfeel
but
otherwise
nothing
overly
complex
it
sure
is
drinkable
and
i
really
enjoyed
drinking
it
but
its
not
overly
interesting
if
i
was
going
to
a
bbq
and
this
was
available
i
might
take
it
but
then
id
probably
just
buy
the
hefe
and
be
really
happy
this
is
a
simple
but
perfectly
executed
lager
the
smell
and
taste
are
similar
grassy
organic
hints
of
clove
and
citrus
hops
linger
slightly
in
a
pleasant
way
in
the
otherwise
very
clean
finish
a
bit
thicker
than
i
was
expecting
theres
a
slightly
creamy
quality
that
i
found
highly
enjoyable
this
is
hilariously
drinkable
stuff
a
great
lager
and
a
good
addition
to
the
fridge
this
ones
recommended
drinkability
easy
drinking
beer
most
definitely
for
the
summer
time
a
style
that
i
am
more
and
more
appreciating
and
trying
to
replicate
in
my
homebrewing
talk
about
tasting
something
again
for
the
first
time
this
is
one
of
the
first
real
germans
i
tried
after
the
obligatory
becks
and
thought
it
was
good
but
i
really
didnt
appreciate
how
good
until
years
later
drinking
it
again
as
an
experienced
imho
ba
the
color
is
nice
somewhat
cloudy
pale
yellow
with
a
fresh
subtle
malthops
in
the
nose
thinner
mouthfeel
but
very
nice
taste
that
balances
the
pale
malt
flavor
with
a
distinctly
fruity
or
citrus
hops
flavor
that
makes
it
extremely
refreshing
to
drink
according
to
a
german
wine
lover
i
know
the
taste
is
reminiscent
if
subtlely
so
of
a
crisp
german
riesling
kabinett
very
goodand
something
that
ive
served
to
bas
and
macro
lovers
alike
with
equal
rave
reviews
truly
a
universally
popular
german
helles
poured
from
the
bottle
into
a
pint
glass
beer
is
a
slightly
hazy
light
yellowgold
color
with
a
thick
bubbly
head
that
blankets
the
top
of
the
beer
the
smell
is
both
sweet
and
spicy
slightly
of
cloves
the
taste
is
very
mellow
with
an
initial
spicy
sweet
malt
nicely
balanced
with
a
decent
hop
profile
and
finishes
with
a
slight
sweetness
the
mouthfeel
is
medium
bodied
with
a
smooth
lightly
carbonated
consistency
this
is
an
enjoyable
and
drinkable
beer
ive
had
their
hefe
several
times
and
i
would
say
this
is
on
the
same
par
as
that
for
the
style
a
crisp
happy
hay
colro
withs
consistant
bubbling
but
a
light
bright
head
of
less
than
one
finger
the
aroma
was
a
pale
and
crystal
amlt
delight
with
hints
of
some
mineral
water
and
grass
the
taste
was
a
crisp
hay
field
of
pale
and
pilsner
malts
the
hard
water
makes
itself
evident
in
this
beer
very
good
though
helps
bring
the
hops
into
a
better
light
slightly
dry
but
other
very
crisp
and
refreshing
palate
i
need
to
have
one
of
these
out
of
a
boot
footnote
from
the
weihenstephaner
website
the
bavarian
state
brewery
weihenstephan
nearly
one
thousand
years
ago
it
was
the
monastery
brewery
of
the
benedictine
monks
then
the
royal
bavarian
state
brewery
today
as
a
regulated
enterprise
of
the
freestate
of
bavaria
it
is
a
company
run
according
to
the
precepts
of
private
business
as
the
oldest
existing
brewery
in
the
world
our
brewery
occupies
an
exalted
site
atop
weihenstephan
hill
in
the
bavarian
city
of
freising
surrounded
by
the
comparatively
still
very
young
weihenstephan
science
centre
of
the
technical
university
of
munich
yet
it
is
precisely
this
unique
combination
of
tradition
and
custom
proven
knowledge
and
modern
science
which
gives
the
brewery
its
incomparable
identity
and
permits
it
to
brew
beers
of
the
highest
quality
poured
a
clear
golden
straw
color
with
a
decent
white
head
that
left
some
nice
lacing
on
the
side
of
the
glass
the
nose
is
very
faint
some
noble
hop
scent
has
a
dry
cracker
malt
taste
with
some
light
hop
flavor
the
flavor
doesnt
stand
out
but
it
is
nice
and
crisp
and
refreshing
the
feel
is
a
bit
watery
crisp
finishes
very
nice
this
is
a
very
drinkable
and
refreshing
beer
why
american
macros
cant
follow
this
style
is
beyond
me
this
poured
light
gold
with
a
1head
average
retention
and
when
it
left
it
look
out
of
this
world
for
a
lager
a
cool
foamystickyness
on
the
surface
with
lots
of
nice
lacing
forming
smell
is
earthy
hops
and
a
hint
of
banana
love
that
hops
on
the
nose
taste
is
a
little
dissapointing
considering
appearance
just
doesnt
go
down
very
easy
mouthfeel
is
nice
but
theres
no
lingering
good
tastes
this
is
overrated
here
would
it
be
a
travesty
to
say
that
velas
hellas
from
gatlinburg
is
as
good
sorry
i
know
this
brewery
has
been
doing
this
since
1040
but
i
thought
it
would
be
better
good
but
not
fantastic
by
any
means
other
than
its
appearance
d
smooth
the
pour
into
my
rarelyused
pokal
raises
a
sweetlooking
offwhite
twofinger
head
that
has
lots
of
large
bubbles
slowly
bursting
through
the
foamy
surface
it
falls
slowly
leaving
sticky
lace
on
the
sides
of
the
glass
below
the
body
is
hazy
deep
golden
yellow
its
about
the
appearance
of
a
filtered
wheat
even
at
the
thinnest
part
of
the
glass
the
nose
smells
of
sweet
grains
and
just
a
tad
less
noble
hop
aroma
than
expected
from
a
pils
clean
and
mild
the
taste
is
the
same
way
ive
enjoyed
helles
before
but
theres
just
not
much
to
be
said
its
got
a
lot
more
taste
than
most
macros
and
unlike
them
no
off
flavors
but
this
just
doesnt
do
it
for
me
mediumlight
in
the
mouth
with
high
carb
i
wont
be
seeking
this
out
my
fav
helles
is
penns
drinkability
a
good
lager
i
havent
tried
specifically
munich
helles
lager
but
this
is
refreshing
and
flavorful
for
a
lager
d
very
quaffable
would
go
well
with
most
food
good
enough
beer
for
its
style
but
nothing
to
make
me
say
wow
d
highly
drinkable
lager
crisp
and
refreshing
its
really
too
bad
this
is
not
more
widely
available
andor
marketed
it
could
convert
a
lot
of
macro
drinkers
to
craft

drinkers

this
is
enjoyable

an

the

means
this
is
not
the
best
option
for
a
refreshing
quaffing
lager
received
in
a
trade
with
finite
thanks
thought
it
was
a
hefe
until
just
before
reviewing
so
not
the

was
expecting
still
a
nice
beer

from

it

at

appealing

not
very
aromatic
the
flavor
is
bright

gently

with
doughybiscuity
and
grainy
malts
that
yield
a
light
sweetness
and
lemonygrassyherbal

the

silky

with
a
light

in
the
short
finish
quite
a
drinkable
beer
and
one
that
is
very
clean

wellbrewed
a
great
helles
that
is
hard
to
savor
because
it
drinks
so
easily
definitely
recommended

for
several
months
now
ive
been
indulging
myself
with
ipa
dipa
stouts
irs
porters
and
pale
ales
this
weekend
i
decided
to
try
some
german
lagers
such
as
this
one
poured
a
clear
blond
hue
with
a
small
frothy
one
inch
white
head
the
head
last
throughout
the
drink
and
left
a
good
amount
of
lacing
the
aroma
was
faint
yet
my
wife
and
i
got
a
whiff
coliander
light
sweet
bread
fresh
cut
hay
and
strangely
enough
clean
barnyard
weird
the
flavor
was
lightly
malty
sweet
from
start
to
finish
nice
fizzy
carbonation
clean
and
crisp
overall
we
like
this
brew
alot
and
glad
we
picked
it
up
the
drinkability
is
easy
and
very
refreshing
d
this
is
a
session
beer
that
goes
well
with
almost
any
food
that
said
there
is
nothing
profound
about
this
beer
which
will
enable
it
to
stand
out
in
my
mind
this
one
complements
my
weihenstephan
0

glass
very
nicely
it
pours
a
light
golden
color
with
a
thick
white
head
that
leaves
some

it
smells
sweet
of
malt
and
honey
tastes
sweet
as
well
not
too
sweet
though
the
malt
and
honey
type
taste
are
evident
so
are
the
slight
hint
of
hops
this
is
a
very
light
and
crisp
brew
very
easily
drinkable
pours
with
a

to

d
what
can
i

its

nothing

i
like
weihenstephaners

better

would

but

is
a
little
prohibitive
i
enjoyed
this
one
drinkability
is
dangerous
drinkability
this
seems
like
a
standard
lager
but
its
still
much
better
than
the
american
macro
version
but
i
still
dont
love
it
drinakbility
just
what
you
look
for
in
a
lager
of
this
type
nice
blend
if
flavors
without
anything
being
too
forward
very
drinkable
one
that
i
hope
to
find
ontap
some
day
and
will
probably
find
it
even
more
drinkable
insession
possibly
skewed
because
im
an
ale
person
but
i
thought
if
anyone
would
make
a
helleslager
that
i
liked
it
would
be
weihenstephaner
apparently
you
just
cant
pull
that
much
flavor
out
of
those
ingredients
this
is
clean
bright
refreshing
and
so
very
very
balanced
d
a
great
hot
day
beer
really
refreshing
and
not
too
terrible
tasting
this
beer
pours
a
clear
golden
yellow
with
a
decent
white
head
that
dissipates
to
a
thin
film
without
much
lacing
the
smell
is
sweet
and
malty
crisp
and
clean
the
taste
is
also
malty
up
front
but
has
enough
hops
to
balance
out
the
flavor
there
is
a
good
mouthfeel
a
little
on
the
thick
side
for
what
it
is
but
still
quite
good
overall
a
great
beer
to
tailgate
or
cool
down
with
in
the
summer
pours
a
pale
yellow
with
a
sticky
white
head
aroma
is
grassy
malt
and
a
faint
smell
of
hops
this
is
a
really
good
smelling
lager
taste
is
biscuity
with
a
slight
amount
of
citrus
and
hops
overall
this
is
a
world
class
lager
from
the
worlds
oldest
brewery
mouthfeel
is
light
bodied
mildly
sweet
and
like
candy
with
a
crisp
bite
cheers
a
very
easytodrink
simple
and
thirstquenching
lager
d
not
bad
but
not
my
cup
of
tea
er
i
mean
beer
sure
this
stuff
goes
down
like
water
and
i
could
pound
them
all
night
but
why
would
i
want
to
gimme
something
with
more
taste
tastes
like
a
pureclassic
german
helles
lager
very
well
balanced
hops
and
malt
with
a
nice
refreshing
hop
bitterness
and
slightly
spicy
malt
to
it
as
well
perfectly
balanced
the
only
complaint
i
have
the
beer
doesnt
have
a
whole
lot
of
finish
that
said
this
appears
to
be
intentional
for
this
style
as
it
goes
very
well
with
food
and
is
an
excellent
thirst
quencher
but
still
complex
on
a
hot
day
d
perfect
the
ultimate
easy
drinker
with
tons
of
hop
undertones
to
add
to
the
complexity
perfectly
balanced
perfectly
refreshing
the
ultimate
bier
in
one
of
my
favorite
styles
quenching
and
pleasant
nota
bona
i
looked
on
the
label
and
read
the
words
cont
malt
liqour
12
fl
oz
i
about
died
when
this
happened
i
was
like
oh
i
guess
there
is
no
reasoning
to
this
universe
then
i
found
the
beers
style
listed
on
here
and
was
releaved
keep
on
rockin
in
the
free
world
very
enjoyable
beer
as
usual
another
great
beer
from
weihenstaphener
dry
and
bitter
with
an
offputting
musky
flavor
to
it
not
something
i
will
try
again
weihenstephaner
is
usually
fantastic
but
this
is
more
than
disappointing
beers
like
this
make
me
wonder
why
things
like
bmc
exist
its
severely
drinkable
simple
inoffensive
but
delicious
i
think
you
could
give
this
to
a
bmc
devotee
and
a
light
might
turn
on
or
off
this
is
a
extremly
drinkable
lager
that
was
very
enjoyable
prost
mk
drinkability
this
is
decent
not
really
great
it
goes
down
easy
and
is
sessionable
pours
a
typical
lager
yellow
same
color
as
bud
with
a
small
white
head
that
fades
fast
leaves
some
lacing
on
the
glass
more
prominent
smell
than
bud
mild
hops
aroma
the
taste
is
much
better
and
more
complex
than
american
macro
lagers
starts
out
with
a
mild
hops
taste
as
you
drink
it
a
malt
flavor
is
more
prominent
in
the
finish
nothing
exciting
here
basically
a
lager
beer
with
stronger
better
taste
and
a
bit
of
complexity
good
with
food
and
would
be
a
good
session
beer
mouthfeel
is
about
right
for
a
lager
a
bit
thin
this
pours
a
clear
yellow
gold
with
a
medium
sized
head
nice
but
nothing
really
special
looking
the
smell
is
something
special
full
of
malt
lemon
floral
aromas
and
a
bakery
yeast
thats
awesome
the
taste
is
crisp
and
clean
with
a
malty
background
with
floral
citrus
and
mild
hop
flavors
the
mf
is
light
and
very
well
mixed
this
is
a
very
good
beer
that
could
be
my
new
lawnmower
beer
cheers
extremely
drinkable
i
could
definitely
drink
a
lot
of
these
in
a
row
especially
out
on
a
hot
summer
day
single
bottle
bought
from
the
fayetteville
harris
teeter
the
code
8024
is
printed
on
the
back
label
this
is
one
of
the
finest
examples
of
the
bavarian
helles
style
i
have
tasted
the
beer
poured
a
straw
gold
color
topped
by
a
white
colored
light
head
fed
by
champagne
bubbles
this
looks
similar
to
a

czech
pils
the
nose
is
very
subtle
slightly
earthy
a
little
grassy
hops
followed
by
just
a
touch

the
taste
is
classic
bavarian
lager
the
earthy
hops
come
to
the
front
of
the
flavor
followed
by
the
light
caramel
i
found
in
the
nose
the
hops
lend
a
mild
bitterness
and
just
a
bit
of
herbal
flavor

feel
very

bottom
line
this
is
superb
lager
that
deserves
your
attention
looks
like
a
light
lager
but
wait
theres
favor
and
no
skunky
smell
did
somebody
forget
the
corn
rice
and
greenclear
bottles
looks
straw
yellow
and
smells
of
pale
slightly
breadybiscuity
malts
taste
is
sweet
with
a
slighty
citrus
bitter
edge
this
reminds
me
of
many
other
euro
and
macro
lagers
but
only
in
the
sense
that
they
tried
to
be
this
beer
but
messed
thigns
up
along
the
way
best
lighter
lager
ive
had
to
date
a
pleasure
to
drink
on
a
hot
day
d
fairly
drinkable
ive
used
this
beer
in
chili
to
good
results
and
served
cold
its
very
refreshing
and
enjoyable
not
my
favorite
style
but
for
the
style
this
is
pretty
good
d
very
drinkable
this
is
my
first
helles
but
it
is
a
my
very
first
great
tasting
lager
for
sure
absolutely
an
awesome
brew
this
is
what
an
american
lager
should
taste
like
highly
recommend
im
glad
a
finally
got
ahold
of
one
of
these
a
nice
change
of
pace
from
the
more
heavy
american
and
belgians
i
have
been
having
lately
this
brew
pours
a
pale
golden
color
the
head
is
small
and
recedes
quickly
into
thin
lacing
the
aroma
is
what
it
should
be
for
a
helles
lager
mildly
malty
with
a
hint
of
saaz
it
is
actually
quite
amazing
how
the
aroma
is
so
vocal
with
such
mild
tones
the
taste
is
refreshingly
malty
the
mouthfeel
is
on
the
lighter
side
of
medium
bodied
with
nice
carbonation
overall
this
is
one
of
the
best
small
beers
i
have
had
to
date
it
is
very
refreshing
interesting
and
easy
to
drink
and
leaves
me
wanting
more
poured
a
pale
golden
color
with
massive
white
puffy
head
smell
is
of
sweetish
malt
and
pleasant
taste
is
full
of
firm
malt
and
gives
a
nice
crisp
taste
sensation
finish
is
more
of
the
maltiness
and
leaves
a
very
refreshing
feeling
in
the
mouth
very
drinkable
and
enjoyable
this
is
one
beautiful
lager
practically
perfect
its
got
an
interesting
taste
but
with
a
lager
smoothness
and
is
highly
highly
drinkable
wow
yum
an
amazing
and
delightful
refreshment
nice
and
crisp
picked
a
growler
of
this
up
at
half
time
beer
store
it
pours
a
light
golden
color
with
a
foamy
white
head
smells
faintly
sweet
the
taste
is
very
understated
and
pleasant
simple
yet
delightful
a
near
perfect
lager
and
a
definite
session
beer
for
a
hot
sweaty
night
search
out
and
enjoy
d
an
average
beer
for
me
impressed
by
how
far
beer
has
come
to
me
this
is
worth
trying
just
to
have
something
that
puts
a
spin
on
the
usual
beer
i
wouldnt
pay
too
much
for
it
though
something
different
but
not
outstanding
but
could
drink
plenty
of
these
in
one
sitting
pours
out
a
brilliant
golden
color
with
a
white
head
that
although
not
that
thick
leaves
tremendous
lacing
appears
to
have
minimal
carbonation
in
the
glass
smells
of
bready
malts
and
spicy
german
hops
with
a
subtle
hint
of
pear
cider
the
hops
run
the
show
in
the
nose
the
malt
is
very
clean
nutty
and
bready
with
a
spicy
hop
kick
at
the
end
just
a
perfect
helles
lager
very
smooth
mouthfeel
and
softly
carbonated
a
flavorful
session
helles
lager
awesome
what
a
disappointment
i
grabbed
this
bottle
thinking
it
was
the
famous
hefeweizen
label
is
very
similar
and
figured
this
would
be
similarly
tasty
but
i
was
woefully
mistaken
i
would
recommend
avoiding
this
one
overall
a
huge
disappointment
this
is
beer
cmon
now
little
flavor
with
no
blls
perfect
sessioner
id
say
no
bitterness
so
no
hop
intrigue
but
hey
sometimes
this
just
hits
the
spot
lovely
highly
drinkable
will
try
again
i
know
from
previous
tastes
this
beer
is
better
than
this
having
said
that
all
those
samples
were
within
50
miles
of
the
brewery
the
mouthfeel
was
mild
and
slightly
dry
quite
light
refreshing
overall
this
was
very
drinkable
not
aggressive
with
a
very
crisp
feel
and
a
nice
balance
im
certainly
glad
i
have
another
one
in
my
fridge
a
beer
that
goes
nicely
with
food
and
beyond
refreshing
nonetheless
i
stick
to
the
other
weihenstephan
offerings
i
picked
this
up
by
mistake
thinking
it
was
the
hefe
i
was
pleasantly
surprised
though
as
it
went
great
with
my
pizza
it
pours
with
perfect
clarity
a
straw
gold
color
with
a
medium
white
head
the
aroma
is
vaguely
sweet
with
a
hint
of
spicy
hops
in
the
background
these
two
elements
switch
places
in
the
taste
a
nice
classically
german
hoppiness
presides
for
the
majority
of
the
taste
not
a
huge
amount
of
bitterness
but
filled
with
a
grassy
florally
element
there
is
a
nice
malty
sweetness
that
provides
a
counterpoint
to
the
hops
this
is
a
very
crisp
and
clean
beer
with
a
beautifully
dry
finish
the
mouthfeel
is
crisp
and
prickly
from
a
fair
amount
of
carbonation
it
goes
down
easy
so
its
fairly
drinkable
a
very
nice
crisp
lager
that
goes
down
very
easily
overall
drink
this
one
fresh
to
get
it
at
its
very
best
and
it
is
unbeatable
however
i
do
find
that
older
samples
soon
turn
sweet
and
into
a
bland
corny
mess
that
tastes
like
an
american
macro
why
is
that
i
wonder
as
this
is
one
of
my
favorite
german
helles
lagers
i
cannot
believe
that
i
never
reviewed
it
before
now
hey
maybe
i
just
enjoyed
drinking
it
too
much
to
sit
down
and
write
about
it
well
now
that
i
do
its
fair
to
say
that
when
fresh
at
least
this
is
a
damned
fine
excellent
brew
solid
stuff
that
i
could
drink
all
day
an
originaloriginal
for
sure
mouthfeel
is
fluffy
soapy
and
bubbly
very
frothy
almost
cappuccinofoamlike
feel
actually
nice
overall
fairly
drinkable
light
nothing
overpowering
to
the
palate
but
i
wouldnt
go
after
this
that
often
drinkability
is
outstanding
top
marks
i
greatly
enjoyed
many
beers
like
this
during
my
time
in
the
usaf
in
germany
a
fine
example
such
as
this
just
makes
me
homesick
for
more
malt
dominated
drinks
are
probably
not
for
me
however
i
think
that
this
is
a
touch
above
average
hop
in
the
aftertaste
but
a
little
stale
it
lowers
the
drinkability
weihenstephaner
beers
have
this
subtle
complexity
which
i
cannot
explain
i
guess
thats
what
happens
when
your
the
oldest
active
brewery
in
the
world
an
outstanding
representation
of
the
helles
style
though
a
little
on
the
hoppy
side
compared
to
many
its
very
accessible
to
macrobrew
drinkers
and
does
a
nice
job
getting
folks
interested
in
better
beer
also
makes
a
great
if
somewhat
pricey
session
beer
bought
a
six
at
hyvee
in
cf
last
week
this
ones
a
good
all
purpose
drinker
pours
nice
not
a
lot
of
foaming
some
lacing
taste
was
smooth
with
a
very
mild
sour
yeast
flavor
with
good
hop
and
malt
balance
they
must
use
some
of
their
hefeweizen
yeast
in
this
because
it
had
a
similar
tartness
just
scaled
down
i
enjoyed
this
one
and
id
buy
it
again
i
cant
say
it
will
change
your
life
but
definately
worth
trying
the
color
is
a
cloudy
golden
with
not
much
in
the
way
of
head
or
carbonation
the
aroma
is
of
light
doughy
malts
with
yeast
smell
mixed
in
the
taste
is
more
of
the
same
classic
munich
malt
taste
with
some
grain
taste
towards
the
finish
yeast
flavors
accenuate
the
malt
body
and
provide
a
mild
fruitness
i
found
this
to
be
a
good
session
beer
but
still
a
little
bit
below
the
quality
i
was
expecting
then
again
i
dont
know
how
long
this
has
been
sitting
on
the
shelf
i
bet
its
truly
excellent
ontap
in
germany
this
straw
colored
brew
poured
a
nice
head
with
decent
head
retention
nose
is
malty
and
perhaps
a
slight
hint
of
a
fruit
taste
starts
with
malts
but
is
dominated
by
a
subtle
hop
finish
mouthfeel
is
nice
and
smooth
overall
this
is
a
tasty
little
lager
that
i
would
recommend
didnt
think
id
ever
like
a
helles
this
much
well
done
overall
please
note
that
this
is
far
from
my
favorite
beer
its
far
from
my
favorite
styles
of
beer
however
within
the
style
i
must
rate
this
beer
high
its
fantastic
d
great
relatively
cheap
for
such
a
great
beer
opinion
this
is
a
super
flavorful
beer
i
just
love
this
style
because
you
have
a
beer
that
is
as
light
as
a
budweiser
sitting
in
front
of
you
that
has
so
much
to
offer
your
palate
they
are
beautiful
when
well
crafted
and
this
is
one
of
them
i
believe
that
there
must
have
been
something
up
at
the
brewery
when
they
bottled
this
batch
because
it
seems
under
carbonated
there
was
a
good
amount
of
offgas
when
i
opened
the
cap
so
i
dont
think
that
it
leaked
besides
the
fact
that
it
still
tastes
good
i
will
definitely
be
drinking
this
beer
again
and
probably
review
it
again
because
i
think
that
this
bottle
is
an
anomaly
a
you
can
guess
its
pretty
light
bodied
while
i
prefer
something
with
a
little
more
substance
or
in
the
case
of
my
beloved
porters
and
stouts
a
lot
more
this
would
be
quite
nice
to
quaff
in
quantity
on
a
hot
day
apparently
the
worlds
oldest
brewery
makes
a
lawnmower
beer
this
is
an
excellent
beer
coming
from
the
oldest
brewery
in
the
world
it
should
be
they
must
be
doing
something
right
to
have
stayed
in
business
since
1040
anybody
up
for
a
weihenstephaner
millenium
celebration
in
about
35
years
final
thought
well
weihenstephaner
makes
another
great
beer
but
it
could
increase
the
flavor
of
this
one
great
bang
for
the
buck
beer
clear
bright
gold
with
bridal
white
head
and
columns
of
carbonation
nose
was
a
bit
bready
but
simply
the
lack
of
a
corn
smell
in
a
beer
this
color
is
enough
to
make
it
a
winner
taste
was
light
and
smooth
this
is
the
answer
to
those
macro
folks
who
cant
taste
their
beers
because
it
has
just
enough
crispness
just
enough
hop
bite
to
make
it
a
quenching
if
a
tad
boring
and
satisfying
beverage
the
mouthfeel
is
a
little
too
thin
but
never
watery
for
my
taste
consuming
these
should
not
be
an
issue
for
anyone
who
even
remotely
likes
beer
this
one
pours
a
clear
blonde
color
with
a
white
head
that
sticks
around
for
a
short
time
no
real
lacing
going
on
the
aroma
is
of
light
malt
and
mild
hops
the
taste
follows
the
nose
it
has
the
flavor
of
light
malt
with
a
light
hop
aftertaste
a
little
bit
of
a
dry
finish
the
mouthfeel
is
average
medium
carbonation
with
a
dry
finish
its
a
semidrinkable
beer
i
wouldnt
stop
anyone
from
trying
it
but
i
dont
know
if
id
recommend
it
its
a
good
beer
but
there
is
nothing
about
it
that
stands
out
and
makes
it
special
pours
a
clear
pale
yellow
almost
the
shade
of
budwieser
with
a
nice
white
head
that
dissapates
quickly
pretty
average
looking
lager
smell
is
bready
malt
with
a
fruity
yeast
background
wasnt
really
expecting
the
fruity
banana
like
smell
from
this
lager
taste
is
pretty
standard
for
a
munich
helles
very
clean
palate
with
a
breadlike
malt
accent
and
a
light
fruity
banana
flavor
hiding
in
the
background
the
finish
is
clean
and
crisp
the
mouthfeel
is
thin
and
its
moderately
carbonated
the
drinkability
is
pretty
high
this
is
a
somewhat
flavorful
beer
thats
extremely
drinkable
a
pretty
good
offering
from
brauerei
weihenstephan
but
not
really
up
to
the
standard
of
their
wheat
beers
pours
a
very
light
golden
color
with
a
finger
of
white
head
a
little
bit
of
lacing
lots
of
carbonation
bubbles
visible
even
after
a
few
minutes
in
the
glass
clean
biscuitlike
malt
aroma
with
a
little
bit
of
floral
hops
are
present
in
the
nose
the
taste
is
more
of
the
same
biscuity
malts
with
a
mild
citric
hoppiness
joining
in
at
the
end
the
extremely
clean
and
crisp
finish
and
the
simple
malt
goodness
makes
this
a
very
refreshing
brew
as
someone
who
prefers
ales
i
must
say
this
is
an
excellent
beer
and
probably
the
best
lager
ive
had
the
pleasure
of
tasting
overall
kind
of
cliched
but
this
is
sort
of
the
grandaddy
of
good
lagers
well
worth
seeking
out
on
tap
its
even
better
than
in
bottles
drinkability
although
im
not
a
big
lager
fan
this
is
a
beer
that
fits
the
bill
to
a
tee
a
good
one
for
a
summers
day
at
the
beach
a
pretty
good
german
brew
hay
like
golden
colour
that
pours
out
clear
with
medium
carbonation
and
a
decent
head
left
a
touch
of
lace
around
the
glass
as
the
head
came
down
odors
of
malt
and
alcohol
were
detected
as
were
the
faint
scent
of
baked
bread
flavor
was
straighforward
and
crisp
with
overtones
of
malt
yeast
and
hops
a
very
good
example
of
german
beers
brewed
to
the
1516
purity
law
worth
a
try
pours
a
very
clear
light
golden
color
with
a
very
tall
white
fluffy
head
appears
very
effervescent
smells
of
grassy
hops
slight
citrus
notes
lemony
and
sweet
toasted
sugar
aromas
taste
is
more
citrusy
than
the
smell
with
a
prominent
lemon
flavor
that
melds
with
some
hop
bitterness
and
a
very
slight
malty
flavor
backing
it
up
extremely
light
and
refreshing
finish
is
crisp
and
clean
with
a
faint
hop
bitterness
lingering
very
drinkable
with
a
light
body
and
high
carbonation
notes
although
im
not
a
lager
drinker
i
do
enjoy
sa
boston
lager
with
large
meals
i
could
see
weihenstephaner
becoming
its
replacement
as
it
is
a
much
more
balanced
not
as
hoppy
alternative
this
beer
may
be
classified
as
a
munich
helles
lager
but
it
tasted
extremely
similar
to
a
breznak
i
had
recently
same
floral
hop
aroma
same
average
head
retention
and
possibly
the
same
effects
of
not
being
quite
fresh
enough
this
last
point
may
have
led
to
the
comparison
i
cant
remember
what
its
like
to
have
fresher
than
the
one
i
just
had
but
in
any
case
this
and
breznak
are
in
the
same
beer
category
in
my
book
in
fact
i
bought
this
thinking
it
was
the
hefeweißbier
which
i
really
felt
like
but
didnt
read
the
label
properly
and
realised
upon
the
first
sip
and
spurious
clarity
that
it
wasnt
a
weissbier
at
all
and
to
think
i
broke
one
of
my
good
weizen
glasses
while
getting
it
out
and
i
wasnt
even
having
a
weissbier
after
all
in
any
case
a
good
beer
better
consumed
fresh
but
doesnt
satisfy
when
youre
after
a
real
weizen
good
thing
im
following
it
up
with
a
weihenstephaner
dunkel
pours
an
effervescent
clear
pale
blonde
color
topped
with
a
pure
white
head
looks
very
refreshing
and
inviting
clean
aroma
of
grass
and
grain
very
slight
floral
note
good
smell
but
a
little
weak
taste
is
very
smooth
and
clean
hops
and
malt
are
equally
married
beginning
to
end
a
refreshing
lemony
hop
jolt
is
well
backed
by
sweet
and
biscuity
malt
some
grassiness
is
present
and
dances
with
faint
fruit
a
hint
of
clove
or
some
other
spice
is
present
as
well
perfect
carbonation
balances
the
creamy
mouthfeel
extremely
drinkable
and
refreshing
lager
clean
tasty
refreshing
authentic
german
lager
nothing
more
to
say
pick
some
up
you
will
love
it

after
abstaining
from
this
brew
for
a
few
days
i
decided
to
give
another
go
with
the
remaining
half
of
my
6
pack
for
some
reason
i
enjoyed
this
much
more
and
have
adjusted
my
marks
accordingly
i
would
still
recommend
the
boulevard
bobs
47
over
this
if
accessible
and
in
season
poured
out
a
yellow
beer
with
much
carbonation
2
finger
head
mild
grainy
smell
slightly
sweet
smell
tastes
pretty
standardwayy
better
then
a
macro
lager
but
along
the
same
linesclean
ending
beer
mouthfeel
is
pretty
boringaverage
not
a
bad
brew
though
wouldnt
mind
knocking
a
few
back
once
in
a
while
pretty
nice
but
i
keep
losing
interest
in
it
took
me
a
while
to
finish
it
off
verdict
not
bad
for
what
it
is
its
not
especially
complex
or
flavorful
but
its
a
nice
easydrinking
malty
lager
im
not
sure
its
worth
paying
import
price
for
it
all
the
time
but
its
a
nice
beer
all
the
same
pours
a
lightly
hazed
straw
gold
color
with
a
thin
white
head
aromas
of
bready
pale
malts
a
light
yeastiness
and
faint
hopping
this
helles
is
going
to
be
swayed
towards
the
malty
side
it
is
very
crisp
and
tasty
malty
and
smooth
lightly
astringent
from
moderate
hopping
that
comes
through
in
the
finish
paired
with
a
faint
citrusiness
which
makes
for
a
very
drinkable
lager
the
yeast
has
its
own
flavor
profile
which
is
faintly
chalky
and
nutty
it
actually
is
pretty
well
balanced
not
as
maltdominant
as
i
thought
from
the
aroma
a
finely
crafted
helles
in
every
sense
recommended
for
any
occasion
when
a
lighter
yet
flavorful
lager
is
in
order
drinkability
good
session
beer
good
crossover
beer
ill
have
to
try
a
sixer
this
summer
i
admit
this
is
a
hardtoappreciate
style
for
me
this
beer
is
spoton
for
all
the
requisite
characteristics
except
the
head
but
it
still
seems
bland
to
me
and
disappointing
because
weihenstephaner
makes
my
favorite
hefeweizen
without
any
doubt
drinkability
that
damn
metallic
flavor
did
it
in
for
this
beer
even
though
the
taste
eventually
went
away
12
through
the
bottle
it
still
ruined
it
for
me
poured
into
the
glass
with
a
small
head
of
foam
almost
non
exsistant
the
aroma
was
refreshing
reminded
me
of
paulaners
orginal
munich
lager
the
taste
came
with
an
orangish
bitterness
upfront
a
tangy
middle
and
a
subtle
dry
finish
very
nice
mouthfeel
the
carbonation
wasnt
overwhelming
pretty
big
bragging
rights
for
being
around
since
1050
i
always
wanted
to
try
something
from
the
worlds
oldest
beer
making
establishment
i
wasnt
disappointed
light
and
crisp
this
is
nice
little
beer
ive
heard
that
its
much
better
in
germany
where
the
bottles
havent
been
sitting
on
the
shelf
for
8
months
before
being
bought
and
this
lager
doesnt
really
seem
as
fresh
as
weihenstephaners
other
beers
still
worth
a
try
though
oelergud
pours
clear
gold
under
a
thick
1
5
finger
white
head
that
lingers
well
but
cant
muster
any
lace
a
smooth
malty
nose
wafts
up
from
the
brew
mild
to
the
point
of
sublime
with
nothing
but
the
purest
barley
tone
the
mouth
is
light
and
very
prickly
the
taste
typifies
the
style
mild
and
smooth
barley
malt
flavors
with
just
a
touch
of
sour
to
add
some
zest
there
is
no
hoppy
bitterness
but
a
flowery
presence
starts
to
grow
as
the
sip
count
increases
and
the
beer
warms
adding
a
hint
of
spice
to
the
aftertaste
this
is
a
good
pleasant
if
not
spectacular
beer
this
brew
has
a
darker

nice
white

very

and

about
as

as
this

of
beer
can
be
done
pours
that
gold
straw
everyone
keeps
talking
about
no
murkinessno
head
minimal
carbonation
no
lace
either
smell
is
malty
grassy
herby
and
typical
of
that
eurolager
type
of
taste
a
small
bit
of
nuttiness
too
taste
is
almost
the
same
as
the
smell
except
it
finishes
wet
on
the
palate
but
in
a
nice
way
which
helps
mouthfeel
and
drinkabilty
overall
the
other
brands
i
mention
are
better
for
this
style
but
i
would
still
recommend
this
one
it
is
quite
refreshing
but
it
lacks
a
little
in
the
flavor
dept
medium
bodied
crisp
and
clean
in
the
mouth
with
billowing
carbonation
flavors
float
all
over
the
place
a
great
beer
anytime
of
the
day
this
is
a
tremendously
drinkable
thirstquenching
refreshing
munich
helles
lager
because
im
not
a
big
fan
of
noble
hops
the
gentle
flavor
and
light
body
is
just
what
the
doctor
ordered
der
rasenmaherbier
indeed
while
not
nearly
the
equal
of
their
hefe
weizen
weihenstephaner
original
is
still
pretty
good
beer
very
drinkable
cant
even
imagine
if
it
was
on
tap
somewhere
near
me
great
beer
defines
german
lager
pours
a
light
straw
color
with
a
big
white
head
that
fades
quickly
to
a
fine
lace
smell
is
predominantly
sweet
malt
maybe
a
little
light
grain
the
taste
is
sweet
and
malty
but
still
very
light
some
hops
follow
with
a
short
dry
finish
mouthfeel
is
good
a
very
nice
light
summers
brew
very
good
drinkability
could
definitely
be
a
good
session
beer
and
one
good
for
converting
macro
drinkers
notes
a
good
drinkable
beer
but
that
is
what
i
expect
from
a
helles
it
didnt
do
anything
special
for
me
id
probably
opt
for
the
one
of
my
good
ol
munich
lagers
next
time
12

not

but
it

would
go
great
with
any
summery
foods
fine
session
brew
not
the
most
pleasant
of
aftertastes
lets
the
overall
beer
down
but
it
is
another
solid
weihenstephaner
offering
a
good
beer
for
drinking
with
light
snacks
like
potato
chips
or
doritos
this
is
a
most
pleasing
helles
the
style
may
be
simple
but
the
beer
is
very
enjoyable
a
good
downtoearth
beer
that
can
be
enjoyed
by
almost
anyone
taste
initially
slightly
sweet
from
the
crisp
maltiness
with
a
nice
full
mouthfeel
elegantly
hopped
with
a
bone
dry
finish
and
lingering
light
bitterness
characteristic
house
yeast
is
an
interesting
addition
to
this
lager
quite
nice
overall
i
will
make
sure
i
am
picking
up
the
right
beer
next
time
i
think
ive
found
my
fall
back
brew
this
is
one
of
the
easiest
drinking
beers
out
there
with
a
nice
crisp
taste
poured
out
a
light
gold
color
with
a
nice
amount
of
carbonation
that
went
away
after
a
while
smell
consisted
of
some
hops
slight
yeasty
aromas
a
little
bit
of
malts
and
a
hint
of
sweetness
to
it
taste
consisted
of
a
doughlike
flavors
blended
in
with
some
hop
bitterness
and
an
ever
so
slight
taste
of
lemons
in
there
finishes
on
the
sweet
side
a
little
but
not
overpowering
because
the
hop
bitterness
balances
it
out
very
well
i
could
drink
these
any
time
of
the
year
crisp
lager
that
goes
down
well
and
yet
has
a
nice
full
body
to
it
im
sold
this
beer
is
clear
with
much
less
head
and
a
smell
that
is
hard
to
quantify
the
finish
is
pretty
dry
this
is
a
good
tasting
beer
the
taste
is
still
kind
of
bready
with
fruit
maybe
pear
i
find
it
a
little
light
tasting
but
i
am
used
to
drinking
strong
full
bodied
beer
clear
gold
on
the
pour
pretty
big
fluffy
head
smells
lightly
of
malty
grass
and
a
tinge
of
hops
light
and
crisp
flavored
not
meant
to
be
a
big
beer
still
above
average
for
a
lager
their
hefeweiss
and
korbinian
are
much
better
although
i
have
no
complaints
about
this
a
fairly
decent
lager
goes
down
easy
brightly
clear
light
golden
dulled
yellow
color
with
a
thin
white
frothed
cap
that
faded
off
quickly
smell
has
a
nice
crisp
and
clean
herbal
essence
with
a
soft
fresh
bread
roll
dough
quite
nice
a
firm
crispness
and
sweet
doughy
breading
for
its
nose
which
really
comes
together
as
it
warms
taste
is
a
nice
crisp
and
clean
hop
some
dried
herbal
variants
float
around
that
are
light
and
airy
with
a
nice
and
firm
bread
dough
sweetish
malt
backing
totally
reminds
me
of
the
dough
used
for
white
bread
rolls
or
cresent
rolls
feel
is
a
bit
lighter
on
the
body
but
the
super
clean
super
crispness
makes
up
for
the
lack
there
of
kinda
sweet
and
very
smooth
quick
crispness
at
first
with
a
lightly
dry
breadish
souring
finish
thats
nice
a
pretty
darn
good
helles
thats
easy
clean
crisp
and
drinkably
good
yum
pours
a
slightly
hazy
golden
hue
with
a
sizeable
foamy
head
beautiful
nose
of
floral
hops
and
a
hint
of
yeast
surprisingly
thin
almost
watery
body
more
floral
hops
on
the
palate
balanced
by
the
yeast
and
a
touch
of
malty
sweetness
with
a
very
subtle
biscuity
character
towards
the
finish
very
little
aftertaste
great
germanstyle
lager
drinkability
oh
yeah
maybe
the
easiest
quaff
ive
had
all
year
i
could
see
myself
buying
cases
of
this
if
i
can
find
a
place
excellent
maybe
even
moreso
than
their
hefe
oh
shucks
they
both
rule
john
very
drinkable
brew
a
superb
lager
pours
a
very
clear
pale
straw
color
with
a
very
creamy
dense
white
2finger
head
the
smooth
smell
of
biscuity
malt
and
well
balanced
hops
will
start
your
mouth
to
watering
wow
the
taste
again
is
smooth
yet
fairly
complex
despite
the
basic
four
ingredients
with
more
of
the
malt
and
a
bit
more
pronounced
hop
than
the
aroma
revealed
and
tapers
into
a
light
dry
bitter
finish
the
mouthfeel
is
silky
in
this
light
to
medium
bodied
beer
this
is
nice
superb
prosit
overall
impression
i
thought
i
picked
up
the
hefeweissbier
and
so
was
very
confused
when
i
started
this
in
comparison
to
its
cousin
this
just
doesnt
seem
right
at
all
on
its
own
merits
as
a
lager
its
well
balanced
and
has
some
mildly
interesting
qualities
a
good
summer
thirst
quencher
session
beer
or
a
decent
beer
to
help
educate
the
masses
but
nothing
ill
seek
out
in
the
future
worth
a
karma
point
but
didnt
rock
my
boat
i
wanted
something
special
for
my
300th
review
i
have
had
everything
available
in
the
local
stores
that
is
special
i
decided
to
try
this
lager
because
it
has
been
really
nice
the
last
few
days
here
in
no
cal
i
thought
a
lager
might
go
down
well
pale
straw
color
that
had
a
white
head
retention
was
minimal
lacing
sparse
aroma
was
weak
but
malt
sweetness
could
be
detected
clean
smooth
malty
base
with
minimal
hopping
some
bitterness
was
detectable
and
i
think
some
lemony
notes
as
far
as
lagers
go
it
was
refreshing
which
is
basically
what
i
look
for
i
can
see
putting
a
away
a
few
of
these
on
days
like
this
but
then
again
id
rather
have
an
anchor
drinkable
if
in
the
right
situation
12
ounce
bottle

original
was
pretty

and
went
down

and
quickly
another

very
nice
helles
straight
outta
munich
classic
in
all
regards
note
being
a
lover
of
this
style
i
was
a
little
disappointed
8
65
a
six
pack
it
should
be
the
second
coming
it
wasnt
buy
spaten
for
two
bucks
less
very
clear
with
a
frothy
white

lightly
carbonated
fresh
aroma
of
earthy

slightly
lemony
grains
slight
metallic
taste
sweet
grainy
body
with
a
decent
bite
cant
get
over
the
metallic
taste
its
ruining
the
enjoyment
here
other
than
that
this
seems
like
a
very
clean
and
highly
drinkable
lager
beer
not
as
crisp
as
a
hoppy
pils
but
more
flavorful
than
your
regular
premium
american
lager
i
will
have
to
sample
this
one
again
cast
and
mold
for
a
light
euro
lager
i
just
wish
more
domestic
craft
brewers
would
add
some
of
the
lesser
known
german
styles
to
their
lineups
but
i
digress
this
brew
pours
a
pale
gold
with
a
scant
brilliant
white
head
the
aroma
is
a
wonderful
amalgam
of
herbal
and
spicy
hops
hallertau
on
parade
grain
and
some
light
malt
balance
is
the
hallmark
of
this
brew
herbal
hops
simple
sugar
maltiness
and
a
slight
breadiness
are
combined
beautifully
spot
on
for
style
any
maltier
and
itd
be
a
dortmunder
any
hoppier
a
pilsener
sign
me
up
for
a
keg
prosit
from
the
oldest
brewery
in
the
world
and
their
experience
shows
aroma
a
mild
citrus
lemony
with
a
hint
of
floralfruity
bouquet
followed
by
a
sweet
malted
nose
taste
good
carbonation
justright
body
kept
from
oversweetness
by
some
citrus
hop
bite
biscuit
malt
and
perfect
yeast
oh
my
gosh
where
has
this
beer
been
the
finish
features
a
light
perfectly
dry
silkglove
slap
from
alcohol
and
a
lingering
hoppy
finish
did
i
mention
this
is
the
best
lager
i
have
ever
tasted
why
has
no
liquor
store
i
have
ever
been
in
not
featured
this
beer
and
only
2
69
for
1
pint
9
oz
around
7
for
a
sixpack
if
you
havent
tried
it

go
find
some
now
update

i
first
reviewed
this
in
2004
with
a
2003
vintage
so
thought
that
i
would
rereview
it
with
a
2005
bottle
im
glad
that
i
did
i
got
a
much
better
head
than
the
original
review
so
raised
the
appearance
from
3
to
4
paid
7
99
for
a
6
pack
this
lager
pours
a
very
pale
clear
yellow
with
just
a
minimum
of
white
headiness
it
has
a
characteristic
lager
smell
a
touch
of
citrus
mixed
with
a
good
balance
of
sweet
malt
and
a
foundation
of
light
hops
the
taste
is
mellow
and
lightly
refreshing
and
theres
a
hintjust
a
hintof
ginger
the
mouth
feel
is
clean
and
sparkling
the
one
complaint
is
that
it
is
farily
expensive
hence
only
average
on
the
drinkability
scale
light
golden
andwell
very
lagery
a
soft
blanket
of
white
head
fades
quickly
to
a
whisper
aromas
are
soft
with
barley
and
sweet
malt
featured
crisp
and
refreshing
in
the
mouth
with
fairly
bold
flavors
for
the
style
sweet
grain
and
freshly
baked
bread
come
to
mind
a
true
to
the
style
brew
yet
overpriced
in
our
market
paid
3
50for
the
pint
bottling
i
can
get
the
hefe
for
less
this
beer
pours
a
clear
gold
color
a
thin
white
head
goes
to
the
top
but
quickly
fades
away
the
aroma
is
a
bit
thin
mainly
malt
and
hops
the
taste
is
crisp
but
also
a
bit
thin
and
matches
the
aroma
it
is
quite
drinkable
but
it
seems
to
be
missing
something
over
all
slightly
above
average
light
gold
color
small
head
aroma
is
a
little
chemical
but
there
is
also
vanilla
and
yeast
a
lighter
bodied
dortmunder
more
largerish
in
taste
light
malts
and
hops
mild
flavor
not
very
complex
mouthfeel
is
full
finish
is
clean
and
crisp
aftertaste
is
slightly
sweet
the
flavor
follows
suit
being
more
of
a
weakly
hopped
pilsener
than
a
strongly
yeastybready
helles
still
lets
not
take
anything
away
from
this
beer
for
what
remains
is
truly
a
very
fine
lager
beer
the
clean
crisp
taste
and
decent
feel
all
speak
well
for
it
and
it
is
very
drinkable
and
enjoyable
we
aint
talking
macro
here
you
know
this
is
a
very
light
bodied
slightly
crisp
lager
nothing
spectacular
nothing
offensive
one
of
these
years
ill
learn
to
appreciate
pilseners
more
i
liked
victorys
prima
pils
dogfish
heads
prescription
pils
but
most
seem
so
bland
to
me
pours
a
clear
pale
yellow
with
a
decent
sized
fluffy
head
smells
clean
and
crisp
with
minimal
hop
pungency
taste
is
decent
seems
a
bit
thin
not
quite
the
pilsner
hop
bite
i
expected
nicely
quaffable
beer
would
be
a
good
session
beer
on
a
hot
day
not
a
bad
beer
just
nothing
too
exciting
would
drink
but
probably
not
spend
the
money
to
buy
i
was
dissapointed
with
this
beer
it
tasted
a
lot
like
grolsh
or
st
pauli
girl
it
had
a
certain
bitterness
at
the
end
that
i
did
not
enjoy
everything
else
about
it
was
okay
a
decent
head
and
a
nice
golden
color
just
a
bitterness
like
grolsh
and
st
pauli
girl
that
i
do
not
like
pours
to
a
brilliantly
clear
straw
color
with
a
thick
white
head
it
leaves
a
good
amount
of
lacing
when
sipped
down
it
has
a
sweet
malty
breadlike
aroma
very
clean
smelling
the
flavor
is
malty
and
bready
with
a
bit
of
sweetness
it
is
a
smooth
drinkable
beer
with
a
drying
finish
a
tasty
refreshing
beer
overall
a
solid
pilsener
this
beer
is
pristine
crystal
clear
grape
juice
colored
beverage
a
nice
sized
white
head
forms
and
dissipates
with
about
the
same
speed
beautiful
malt
nose
man
i
love
it
subtle
notes
of
german
hops
as
well
the
mouthfeel
is
lacking
carbonation
a
little
flat
in
my
opinion
the
flavor
is
a
step
down
from
the
nose
the
maltiness
is
subtle
almost
too
subtle
and
the
hops
impart
a
bitterness
that
is
not
overdone
but
not
very
distinct
either
maybe
the
lack
of
carbonation
is
bugging
me
too
much
but
something
just
doesnt
seem
up
to
par
here
poured
a
thin
head
that
dissapeared
quickly
leaving
a
nicely
carbonated
clear
light
amber
lager
aroma
is
of
sweet
malt
accentuated
by
a
light
hopiness
the
taste
is
a
very
nice
blend
of
german
hops
with
a
clean
finish
the
body
is
light
and
this
beer
is
full
of
carbonation
that
is
very
fine
overall
this
beer
is
very
drinkable
and
as
it
warmed
a
little
it
became
more
balanced
and
smooth
f
this
brew
was
a
highly
carbonated
pour
which
immediately
filled
my
glass
with
a
white
head
of
small
bubbles
and
a
light
transparent
yellow
orange
color
its
aroma
reminds
me
of
fruits
but
its
taste
is
not
fruity
but
man
i
wish
i
was
better
able
to
describe
my
tastes
this
one
escapes
me
too
it
is
carbonated
and
smooth
very
drinkable
and
does
not
convey
a
high
alcohol
content
it
was
an
easily
drinkable
beer
as
good
or
better
than
oh
say
85
of
all
the
lagers
in
the
world
this
is
without
a
doubt
one
fine
lager
not
much
of
an
aroma
from
this
one
but
that
seems
to
be
the
case
with
many
lagers
poured
a
very
clear
golden
color
with
minimal
bubbles
this
stuff
is
insanely
easy
to
drink
i
find
it
very
hard
to
set
the
glass
down
once
ive
picked
it
up
great
beer
for
summer
time
also
if
you
like
lager
definately
give
this
one
a
try
this
lager
poured
a
bright
clear
light
straw
color
from
its
brown
pint
bottle
the
head
was
a
fluffy
white
and
did
not
last
long
a
thin
ring
of
bubbles
clung
to
the
liquid
line
and
left
a
little
lace
the
aroma
was
only
of
malt
and
fairly
subtle
the
taste
was
of
malt
with
a
hint
of
chocolate
there
was
a
slight
hop
bite
the
mouthfeel
was
light
all
in
all
this
is
a
good
beer
but
not
a
great
one
i
could
see
drinking
this
with
a
bunch
of
brats
and
potatoe
salad
2

16
oz
i
would
get
this
again
but
i
prefer
slightly
more
carbonation
and
a
bit
more
dryness
in
the
finish
not
bad
just
not
the
best
ive
ever
had
pours
a
slightly
hazy
deep
golden
straw
color
with
a
puffy
white
head
that
quickly
fades
into
a
thin
creamy
lace
nose
is
sweet
cakelike
malts
with
a
bit
of
fresh
cut
lemon
light
to
medium
in
body
with
a
lively
and
crisp
texture
taste
is
sweet
malt
lightly
toasted
bread
and
fresh
baked
biscuits
followed
by
some
wonderful
nutty
yeasts
and
herbal
hops
with
a
touch
of
lemon
one
of
the
finest
lagers
in
the
world
the
smell
is
simple
lagery
same
in
the
front
with
some
slight
fruitiness
the
middle
is
sweetish
a
little
corny
finishing
dry
and
a
little
metallic
after
the
hefe
this
is
a
little
disappointing
theres
nothing
bad
about
it
but
theres
nothing
special
about
it
either
its
actually
not
far
off
a
good
na
notes
overall
i
am
very
dissapointed
with
my
first
taset
of
the
worlds
oldest
brewery
this
was
a
well
brewed
lager
but
very
pedestrian
ordinary
give
me
a
paulaner
lager
or
a
jahr
hundert
bier
anytime
poured
a
clear
light
yellow
with
medium
foam
the
smell
was
of
a
hoppy
and
citrus
nature
the
taste
was
of
hops
and
a
lemon
citrus
flavor
with
a
dry
bitterness
that
i
was
not
impressed
at
all
with
this
lager
was
not
what
i
expected
from
this
brewery
this
one
sits
squarely
atop
mt
helles
i
would
have
to
consider
this
to
be
the
best
beer
labeled
as
a
palelager
that
i
have
had
edging
out
paulaner
original
munich
and
samuel
smiths
this
beer
is
so
clean
and
refreshing
no
trace
of
skunk
pours
a
relatively
ordinary
looking
pale
glass
of
beer
smaller
foamy
head
which
dissapates
rather
quickly
refreshing
almost
flowery
smell
and
taste
this
may
be
the
softest
beer
ive
ever
had
to
me
this
is
the
kind
of
beer
that
would
have
a
shot
at
converting
some
of
the
masses
if
they
ever
tried
it
just
as
refreshing
as
an
american
lager
or
even
a
wheat
beer
not
bitter
at
all
weihenstephan
is
top
quality
all
the
way
i
love
their
beer
and
nobody
does
any
better
with
wheat
beer
or
lagers
package
reviewed
was
a
pint
brown
longneck
which
was
labeled
malt
liqour
supporting
the
grainy
malt
flavor
is
very
delicate
the
lace
thin
clinging
sheets
to
envelop
the
glass
the
prototypal
lagerpils

nose
and
one
fine
beer
especially
here
when
you
come
in
from
the
115fahrenheit

in

there
was

any

with
a
bright
white
head
that
dies
quickly
it
does
maintain
a
nice
collar
throughout
the

but
the
surface
retains
only
whisps
of
foam
outstanding
aroma
of
bright
continental
aroma
white

doesnt
last
long
at
all
mild
maltiness
there
is
anticipation
for
the
next
one
perfect
balance
between
aroma
and
is
a
definitive
example
of
the
style

grain
o
this
was
ok
but
not
really
worth
revisiting
maybe
a
good
session
beer
but
nothing
to
write
home
about
overall
nice
helles
lager
would
have
like
more
toasted
than
sweet
notes
summer
of
lager
is
rather
authentic
tasting
version
of
a
munich
helles
lager
kudos
to
cisco
brewers
for
making
a
summer
beer
that
bucks
the
norm
overall
its
a
fine
beer
but
doesnt
really
impress
me
and
comes
off
slightly
disappointing
than
anything
warmth
really
brings
the
honey
and
sweetness
out
more
too
maybe
3
78
isnt
so
bad
after
all
came
back
to
this
after
hard
indian
summer
paddle
liked
it
even
more
great
with
scallops
crabcakes
summer
veggies
over
peppers
hard
to
imagine
a
better
treatment
of
this
style
i
wish
it
would
come
in
cans
i
had
this
on
a
hazy
summer
day
at
the
pony
bar
on
manhattans
upper
east
side
dont
expect
a
summer
wheat
or
kolsch
because
this
beer
is
clearly
a
helles
lager
made
to
represent
the
german
style
the
smell
was
a
bit
doughy
like
yeast
meeting
malts
the
color
was
a
bright
orange
the
taste
reminded
me
more
of
a
pilsner
but
better
malt
grain
a
touch
of
citrus
and
virtually
no
hops
overall
it
was
ok
just
not
my
preferred
style
woodychandler

taste
is

malty
a
touch
of
lemon
some
light
hops
very
refreshing
feels
medium
bodied
in
the
mouth
and
overall
is
a
thirst
quenching
beer
on
a
hot
day
have
to
say
really
liked
this
offering
from
cisco
as
an
alternative
to
wheat
and
kolschs
that
seem
to
rule
the
summer
beer
scene
poured
out
of
the
can
into
a
pilsner
glass
the
color
is
a
dark
golden
with
a
fluffy
head
crisp
flavor
with
slight
fruit
hints
easy
aroma
thats
good
for
day
drinking
good
stuff
i
got
a
spritz
during
the
crack
so
it
got
a
few
minutes
to
cantemplate
what
was
going
to
happen
next
before
i
initiated
the
glug
as
any
simpleton
like
me
might
have
deduced
an
inverted
aggro
glug
was
going
to
be
nothing
but
trouble
so
even
with
a
gentle
glug
i
was
still
getting
foaming
it
all
worked
out
however
as
i
ended
up
with
two
dense
foamy
fingers
of
bonewhite
head
that
resembled
to
top
of
a
swirly
vanilla
ice
cream
cone
color
was
a
deep
sunshineyellow
with
nequality
clarity
srm
45
nose
smelled
like
the
interior
of
a
malt
room
at
a
brewery
mouthfeel
was
mediumto
full
big
for
a
lager
and
the
taste
was
biscuit
malt
and
maybe
some
noble
hops
to
lend
a
grassiness
to
it
mmmm
this
was
very
dry
especially
on
the
finish
and
i
found
myself
longing
for
some
pretzels
to
go
with
it
would
this
go
in
my
cooler
heck
yes
o
i
applaud
cisco
for
attempting
to
make
a
style
that
is
not
very
popular
with
american
brewers
but
that
said
this
is
not
close
to
a
traditional
helles
lager
that
you
would
get
at
a
beer
hall
or
beer
garden
in
munich
certainly
tasty
enough
to
have
more
than
a
few
on
a
hot
summer
day
at
the
beach
though
f
does
the
trick
of
a
quality
lager
light
crisp
refreshing
carbonation
is
felt
very
nicely
oda
nice
lager
but
its
quite
expensive
good
move
putting
it
in
a
12
pack
of
cans
the
older
large
format
bottles
were
far
too
pricey
for
a
good
yet
fairly
simple
lager
o
not
your
typical
munich
helles
lager
but
worth
a
shot
a
good
summer
beer
d
nice
to
have
a
little
more
balls
on
this
munich
hellles
but
still
needs
a
little
refining
imo
worth
trying
however
and
nice
to
see
an
american
craft
brewing
this
style
summer
of
lager
offers
nice
grainy
malt
and
citrus
aroma
on
the
nose
the
taste
is
extremely
wellbalanced
with
a
citrus
and
herbal
hop
punch
just
strong
enough
to
be
thirst
quenching
over
the
wellcomposed
grainy
pilsneresque
malt
base
the
mouthfeel
is
light
and
refreshing
and
the
drinkability
is
good
a
very
good
lager
o
a
little
early
in
the
season
but
this
is
a
really
good
beer
for
the
summer
overall
its
a
very
flavorful
and
complex
beer
while
it
is
refreshing
and
easy
to
drink
this
lager
is
way
more
complicated
than
the
horde
of
ales
that
define
the
summer
season
this
is
either
good
or
bad
depending
on
what
youre
expecting
from
the
brew
if
youre
tired
of
the
typical
summer
ale
and
thirst
for
something
different
its
a
good
thing
if
you
just
want
something
simple
quenching
and
refreshing
for
the
summer
months
its
bad
either
way
no
one
who
appreciates
beer
would
have
a
hard
time
enjoying
it
all
the
same
nice
overall
pretty
dry
and
refreshing
without
being
overly
thin
quite
frankly
taste
is
not
much
better
than
your
standard
lager
if
youre
looking
for
something
that
lingers
a
bit
on
your
pallet
and
presents
a
bit
more
robustly
this
is
your
lager
overall
this
is
a
very
good
canned
lager
i
like
it
better
than
its
rating

this
is
all
goes
into

pretty
nice
flavor
on
the
taste
with
a
clean
grassy
brightness
that
makes
way
to
a
lime
zest
like
finish
all
the
while
being
anchored

like
maltiness
very
solid
lager
here
easy

these

good
stuff
notes
this
is
a
fine
beer
balanced
good
looking
the
old
gold
color
is
dark
for
the
style
it
has
a
pleasant
taste
and
mouthfeell
my
only
issue
is
that
the
abv
is
a
bit
high
as
this
is
such
a
sessionable
beer
and

overall
a

would
buy
again
if

cheers
o
i
didnt
care
for

much
but
it
was
a
decent
o
tasty
goes
down
very
easily
not
too
filling
mild
kick
good
representation

style
this
is
a
solid
beer
to
pound
down
for
a
while
when
youre
looking
for
something
simple
o
overall
a
decent
helles
lager
i
liked
the
nose
though
the
taste
was
a
bit
average
nice
for
a
summer
day
would
have
again
but
wouldnt
seek
it
out
the
beer

with

slight
lemony

a
dry

the
taste

pale

tart
finish
it
is
lemony
and
quite
refreshing
the
mouthfeel
is
good
it

this
is
an
excellent
lager
and
a
real
summer
time
treat
o
was
quite
enjoyable
perfect
for
the
bbq
and
sipping
around
the
pool
especially
in
cans
at
the
time
did
not
realize
it
was
6
25
very
nice
for
that
abv
mouthfeel
is
good
light
body
good
crisp
carbonation
this
is
a
very
nice
beer
but
it
cant
stand
up
to
the
flavors
of
summer
food
flavor
was
stomped
out
by
a
burger
for
this
style
just
get
weihenstephaner
o
overall
this
is
a
fantastic
summer
beer
it
is
light
bodied
and
highly
drinkable
but
has
enough
flavor
to
make
a
very
nice
session
beer
without
getting
bored
did
not
know
this
was
over
6
abv
that
surprised
me
it
is
very
drinkable
recommended
o
a
pretty
balanced
germanstyle
lager
for
the
summer
sippin
season
at
a
time
when
kolsch
american
pale
wheat
ales
and
pilsners
dominate
the
summer
landscape
im
glad
to
see
a
sturdy
6
25
abv
german
lager
make
its
way
into
the
fold
ok
so
i
waited
on
this
one
a
bit
too
long
it
being
midoctober
when
i
finally
got
around
to
cracking
it
open
pours
into
a
shaker
a
clear
bronzed
yellow
with
a
slight
chill
haze
and
a
nice
foamy
white
head
that
recedes
to
a
thin
layer
leaving
a
bit
of
lace
behind
i
really
like
the
aroma
honey
and
a
touch
of
yeast
funk
bready
with
a
touch
of
hops
crisp
taste
of
grains
and
toasted
bread
light
floral
hop
bitterness
for
a
dry
finish
and
overall
nice
balance
light
mouthfeel
a
tad
metallic
in
the
aftertaste
but
definitely
refreshing
and
drinkable
overall
this
one
is
just
a
classic
lager
o
a
fairly
easy
drinking
lager
with
a
slightly
strange
sourmusty
character
that
im
really
not
digging
too
much
not
too
shabby
perhaps
not
rough
but
still
pretty
raw
tasting
worth
a
try
though
one
was
good
enough
for
me
sampled
on
july
17
2011
it
has
a
pale
yellow
pour
which
is
a
little
cloudy
and
there
is
virtually
no
head
or
lacing
the
aroma
is
moderately
malty
with
a
citrus
zing
backing
it
up
the
overall
weught
of
the
body
is
around
medium
but
there
is
a
nice
smooth
feel
to
it
the
taste
tends
to
be
on
the
bitter
side
with
a
light
hopped
balance
likeable
overall
i
was
very
pleased
with
this
beer
not
usually
a
huge
fan
of
lagers
but
this
delivers
tastes
everyone
can
love
enough
complexity
to
suit
a
beer
geek
such
as
myself
but
still
easily
pounded
by
someone
who
enjoys
swill
im
definatly
intrigued
with
what
this
brewery
has
to
offer
and
hopefully
i
can
find
more
of
their
beers
a
good
summer
lager
and
i
am
usually
not
a
fan
of
this
type
of
beer
it
is
refreshing
and
balanced
deep
golden
in
the
light
and
on
the
verge
of
copper
just
looking
at
it
on
the
table
a
decent
amount
of
light
fluffy
head
at
the
start
but
dwindles
down
to
just
a
thick
ring
around
the
edges
the
aroma
is
earth
and
hay
with
a
solid
backbone
of
fresh
milled
grain
flavor
is
light
and
tangy
sweet
subtly
toasted
malt
flavors
and
a
earthygrassy
hop
finish
a
lot
of
carbonation
on
the
back
of
your
throat
along
with
a
slight
metallic
tingle
right
after
you
swallow
however
that
gets
covered
up
by
the
grassy
hops
the
finish
is
has
a
bitterness
that
creeps
on
you
but
is
pleasant
some
lemon
flavors
are
present
right
as
finish
begins
smooth
and
light
body
with
a
strong
hopbitter
finish
o
an
overall
decent
offering
clean
flavors
easy
to
drink
and
pretty
tasty
nothing
thats
going
to
knock
your
socks
off
but
well
done
overall
a
great
beer
if
the
weird
grassiness
was
toned
down
still
pretty
good
stuff
a
good
summer
beer
perfect
for
thrist
quenching
this
is
a
winner
for
the
style
easy
to
drink
and
highly
enjoyable
id
prefer
this
over
a
macro
cleandrinking
lightmedium
bodied
a
definite
helles
lager
trait
not
pils
but
strikes
you
with
a
delightful
uncommon
dissonance
a
decent
stab
at
a
lighter
beer
from
a
overhyped
brewery
that
usually
overstuffs
its
brews
with
fat
belgian
traits
whether
they
are
appropriate
or
not
for
a
lager
this
is
heavier
denser
and
maltier
than
i
expected
but
it
still
felt
buoyant
not
much
aroma
but
decent
flavors
that
are
dominated
by
malt
and
a
bit
of
bread
not
your
average
helles
by
any
means
fresh
summer
beer
with
little
of
the
malt
showing
up
on
the
taste
mature
hop
bitterness
in
the
swallow
lingers
well
the
body
is
quite
light
naturally
lots
of
spritz
a
good
beer
for
a
hot
day
had
a
pint
at
liberty
st
tavern
i
assumed
this
was
a
pilsner
based
on
the
strong
spicy
hop
character
its
not
overpowering
but
provide
a
tasty
balance
to
the
mild
toasty
grains
the
beer
didnt
have
soft
bready
feel
of
a
classic
helles
but
that
doesnt
really
matter
this
is
a
fine
lager
worth
enjoying
over
the
summer
this
is
an
easy
drinking
refreshing
beer
great
for
a
hot
summer
day
summer
of
lager
is
a
fantastic
lager
that
comes
in
at
just
under
6
percent
alcohol
by
volume
and
is
full
of
flavor
while
maintaining
its
balance
and
subtletiesas
a
good
lager
should
definitely
a
must
try
for
lagerheads
or
anyone
wanting
to
try
a
solid
interpretation
of
a
german
munich
helles
my
alltime
favorite
cisco
product
i
nice
frothy
white
head
greets
you
as
you
sip
this
golden
colored
brew
with
nice
carbonation
sweet
breadyfruit
aromas
flavor
is
of
sweet
and
tart
grapefruit
and
biscuit
malts
wonderfully
refreshing
and
delicious
on
a
hot
summer
night
more
than
happy
with
this
beer
my
first
from
cisco
not
a
textbook
helles
but
still
delicious
almost
like
a
lighter
maibock
grabbed
a
growler
of
this
stuff
last
time
i
was
on
island
at
the
acbf
after
telling
the
cisco
rep
that
this
was
one
of
my
favorites
he
told
me
that
this
years
was
their
best
batch
ever
lets
see
if
theyre
right
lager
smell
comes
rushing
out
as
soon
as
the
growler
is
opened
clear
gold
in
color
with
a
finger
of
white
heading
husky
fresh
grain
and
red
grape
skin
become
apparent
in
the
nose
more
fresh
grains
in
the
taste
with
the
malt
showing
a
lot
of
character
the
balance
is
quite
nice
between
the
malts
and
hops
though
the
malts
come
out
on
top
as
they
should
mouthfeel
is
light
to
medium
and
makes
for
a
perfect
summer
session
lager
after
having
had
this
beer
numerous
times
since
i
first
reviewed
it
i
am
certain
that
the
original
review
was
of
a
bad
bottle
that
being
said
this
is
a
brew
that
should
be
had
fresh
so
drink
your
bottle
soon
or
go
to
the
brewery
and
enjoy
everything
in
moderation
here
good
drinkable
beer
d
great
beer
to
have
at
a
barbecue
and
definitely
easy
to
have
a
few
very
tasty
and
refreshing
dgood
for
a
summer
day
not
what
i
was
expecting
but
glad
i
tried
it
d
good
very
refreshing
waited
a
while
to
have
this
one
picked
up
in
july
09
and
drank
on
1410
but
it
was
still
in
good
shape
would
recommend
getting
after
this
soon
after
you
pick
it
up
overall
not
too
bad
the
tartness
of
this
one
is
a
bit
offsetting
and
makes
me
take
smaller
sips
than
expected
i
think
this
is
probably
a
good
brew
for
around
the
grill
or
with
hot
weather
fare
not
sure
if
id
have
this
again
i
dont
hate
it
but
not
unique
or
good
enough
for
me
to
have
this
instead
of
something
else
drinkability
a
very
nice
summer
lager
tastes
very
light
in
flavor
like
a
wheat
but
definitely
a
lager
not
for
a
hardcore
lager
lover
but
great
for
a
lighter
wheatier
taste
drinkability
not
what
i
was
expecting
at
all
as
this
tastes
more
like
an
ale
rather
than
a
lager
very
unusual
but
i
rather
enjoyed
it
notes
from
and
tasted
on
031208
d
i
could
drink
this
all
day
a
helluva
lager
d
goes
down
smooth
and
easy
pours
a
transparent
light
gold
color
soapywhite
head
and
lots
of
sticky

crazyactive
carbonation
is
putting
on
a
show
in
the
glass
sort
of
a
lemonyearthy
quality
to
the
nose
on
this
beer
a
little
on
the
sour
side
taste
is
nice
a
good
clean
and
moderately
bitter
hop
presence
maybe
a
tiny
bit
of
green
apple
in
the
taste
too
really
good
mouthfeel
bubbles
almost
feel
cleansing
and
it
was
quite
a
bit
better
than
i
thought
it
would
be
georgiabeerjan
24
but
this
is
rich
and
nicely
bodied
for
a
generally
lighter
styled
beer
nice
and
clean
so
ability
to
smell
could
be
broken
at
this
time
taste
was
a
whack
in
the
face
with
an
orange
as
i
drank
this
moved
to
a
more
general
citrus
flavor
but
very
faint
but
it
obviously
raises
a
mamooth
of
a
white
head
with
mountainous
lacing
and
rockiness
the
body
is
fully
hazy
yeasty
no
doubt
buoyed
by
the
steadily
streaming
effervescent
carbonation
from
below
and
it
leaves
wide
sheets
of
thin
but
solid
lace
about
the
glass
the
nose
is
clean
and
its
immensely
drinkable
its
very
well
done
and
nice
to
come
across
one
that
is
not
in
the
elevatedhop
category

overall

not
bad
but
nothing
extremely
special
overall
it
is
clear
that
lagers
are
not
a
strong
point
for
3fs
they
should
stick
to
what
they
are
good
at
ipas
pas
you
get
the
idea
o
an
illustration
of
what
a
traditional
brew
would
look
like
if
done
by
3
floyds
honestly
this
kind
of
lager
is
not
my
go
to
drink
so
while
i
thought
it
was
well
done
i
probably
would
not
opt
for
it
again
o
good
for
the
german
lager
style
not
my
goto
style
so
i
may
be
underrating
this
beer
the
style
is
d
efinitely
not
my
favorite
but
i
think
this
was
a
nicely
done
helles
the
taste
is
right
on
the
scent
with
strong
bread
and
cracker
flavor
ultra
crisp
on
the
tongue
it
is
a
fine
example
of
the
german
style
lager
that
have
existed
for
so
long
o
maybe
because
i
was
in
the
mood
for
a
lager
but
i
really
enjoyed
this
wish
it
came
in
6
packs
because
the
drinkability
is
ridiculously
high
on
the
beer
very
clean
and
crisp

great

extremely
smooth

crisp
to

a
very
enjoyable
offering
as
expected
german
lagers
arent
my
thing
but
ive
learned
to
appreciate
the
use
of
noble
hops
overall
its
an
easy
drinker
its
crisp
and
refreshing
making
it
ideal
for
a
warm
day
its
also
relatively
low
by
todays
standards
in
alcohol
so
you
can
sit
back
and
enjoy
several
and
not
end
up
in
jail
overall
decent
a
rather
safe
and
solid
beer
nothing
off
the
wall
that
fff
is
famous
for
its
balanced
light
low
alcohol
and
easy
to
enjoy
right
on
par
for
the
style
worth
a
drink
for
the
style
o
citrusy
and
fruity
lager
not
my
favorite
style
i
liked
this
one
i
dont
understand
why
this
beer
is
still
brewed
when
zombie
dust
is
vastly
superior
in
every
regard
and
only
marginally
stronger
though
i
suppose
if
you
want
a
fff
beer
that
tastes
like
nothing
gorch
hits
the
jackpot
o
very
good
example
of
a
helles
lager
here
also
pretty
normal
for
the
its
not
normal
brewery
i
would
put
this
up
to
a
surly
hell
any
day
perfect
beer
for
a
summer
day
i
thought
this
beer
was
a
perfect
balance
of
sweetness
hops
and
malt
very
drinkable
and
will
do
it
again
if
i
can
find
another
bottle
gorch
fock
is
a
somewhat
unusual
release
from
three
floyds
it
actually
ispretty
normal
its
very
consistent
with
the
style
and
doesnt
have
anything
out
of
the
ordinary
going
on
at
all
nevertheless
its
very
good
stuff
definitely
worth
checking
out
overall
three
floyds
with
a
deft
hand
this
is
awe
overall
ok
wont
get
again
very
easy
drinking
great
light
complexity
very
easy
drinking
pours
a
moderately
dark
yellow
with
a
nice
white
head
smell
is
doughy
sweet
malt
with
traces
of
hops
fairly
simple
but
well
executed
taste
is
quite
as
clean
mouthfeel
is
light
to
medium
with
good
carbonation
and
nice
body
good
drinkability
but
not
my
favorte
three
floyds
beer
verdict
the
helles
lager
isnt
a
very
interesting
style
but
for
what
this
beer
is
its
great
certainly
kills
any
bmc
beer
out
there
and
would
be
a
great
beer
to
get
a
friend
into
the
world
of
craft
a
very
good
helles
lager
well
balanced
with
good
noble
hops
nice
and
complete
on
the
feel
with
good
depth
but
lacking
some
on
flavors
a
good
helles
not
world
class
by
any
means
o
a
very
enjoyable
beer
i
could
see
this
being
very
awesome
on
a
hot
summer
day
very
unique
for
a
three
floyds
beer
definitely
their
least
weirdmost
normal
beer
its
good
to
see
they
didnt
try
to
overload
this
one
with
hops
like
they
do
for
many
of
their
selections
i
would
definitely
buy
this
again
if
it
werent
for
the
hefty
price
feels
crisp
and
loaded
with
cereal
grains
slight
skunk
flavor
but
not
as
much
as
i
would
have
thought
for
its
age
so
crisp
and
clean
almost
feels
like
a
slightly
heavy
kolsch
reminds
of
a
more
crisp
and
clean
warsteiner
premium
verum
a
very
good
helles
lager
one
of
the
better
ive
had
which
isnt
a
whole
lot
admittedly
crisp
and
highly
drinkable
m
lighter
side
of
medium
body
well
carbonated
crisp
yet
smooth
finish
very
nice
mouthfeel
o
i
wasnt
sure
on
what
to
think
of
this
beer
because
i
wasnt
too
familiar
with
the
style
but
damn
its
good
its
super
drinkable
and
has
a
great
taste
thats
totally
new
for
me
i
really
wish
floyds
was
cheaper
because
theirthis
beer
is
amazing
as
always
d
you
can
drink
this
like
water
hand
me
mein
stein
do
fun
to
try
but
i
feel
little
need
to
repeat
in
the
future
the
aroma
was
light
some
small
amount
of
smoked
in
it
with
lots
of
grain
and
bready
malts
though
i
have
to
admit
not
much
here
to
really
pick
up
on
the
flavor
was
a
bit
better
lots
of
campfire
like
smokiness
in
it
with
a
subtle
yet
easily
definable
bready
malt
base
some
sweetness
caramel
maybe
and
a
light
peach
flavor
when
cold
that
quickly
gets
burnt
out
by
the
smoked
and
roasted
malts
enjoy
overall
good
beer
again
not
the
best
in
its
class
but
a
solid
beer
that
i
would
be
proud
to
call
my
own
it
must
be
hard
to
try
and
recreate
such
a
style
that
has
been
brewed
by
genius
brewmasters
in
europe
for
centuries
all
in
all
i
dont
think
i
would
buy
this
beer
again
though
if
i
were
at
a
bar
and
this
were
available
it
would
be
something
i
would
consider
getting
with
friends
if
i
could
buy
this
in
sixpacks
i
would
keep
more
of
this
in
the
house
during
the
summer
light
body
with
some
good
carbonation
that
is
nice
for
this
style
very
clean
and
easy
to
drink
beer
with
some
decent
flavor
though
i
would
have
like
a
little
more
floral
hopping
on
the
nose
and
taste
o
thought
this
was
a
pretty
solid
lager
and
you
dont
often
find
a
well
made
helles
from
a
us
brewery
o
nice
overall
i
feel
it
could
use
a
bit
more
in
the
hops
department
i
did
not
know
three
floyds
could
brew
such
a
subtle
clean
beer
they
really
showed
their
craftmenship
with
this
beer
o
light
style
of
beer
and
just
not
what
i
like
its
good
for
its
style
but
i
just
prefer
things
that
are
more
complex
beer
is
medium
in
body
leads
off
with
a
little
pilsner
sweetness
bigger
body
than
expected
but
still
has
a
dry
finish
nice
little
session
lager
here
sweet
mildly
bitter
probably
about
25
ibu
on
the
backend
there
nice
id
have
this
beer
again
overall
three
floyds
claims
that
this
beer
is
as
traditional
as
theyll
ever
get
not
a
bad
choice
for
those
seeking
a
crisp
and
refreshing
lager
with
low
alcohol
while
still
maintaining
a
taste
and
complexity
that
cant
be
matched
by
the
macros
crisp
tender
medium
bodied
with
a
wholesome
smooth
easy
going
texture
and
carbontation
thats
lightly
bready
sweet
and
just
dry
and
crisp
enough
to
add
some
welcome
depth
leaves
the
mouth
with
a
light
biscuity
fluffy
dryness
and
crisp
grainy
texture
and
definately
leaves
you
wanting
more
very
drinkable
stuff
as
most
helles
lagers
are
and
this
3f
creation
is
no
different
and
fitting
within
the
scope
of
most
3f
brews
that
hit
the
mark
for
style
another
solid
offering
from
3f
showing
they
can
hold
back
and
make
a
great
light
style
as
well
though
its
nothing
special
its
been
a
couple
years
since
i
first
had
this
and
i
was
pleasantly
surprised
lighter
bodied
ample
carbonation
easy
drinking
pretty
much
spot
on
crisp
light
finish
that
drinks
very
easily
a
superb
beer
that
is
a
nice
change
of
pace
for
3floyds
overall
a
shockingly
traditional
tale
on
a
beer
from
the
fff
gang
it
works
thanks
to
the
extra
bitterness
all
in
all
this
is
fairly
drinkable
its
a
style
i
dont
go
for
much
and
this
beer
hasnt
persuaded
me
to
start
buying
or
drinking
more
of
them
but
it
is
enjoyable
nonetheless
ive
constantly
missed
out
on
the
bottled
version
of
this
or
rather
ive
always
gone
with
a
different
bottle
until
it
disappeared
from
shelves
so
it
was
nice
to
see
it
on
tap
when
i
made
my
longawaited
return
to
the
firkin
it
pours
a
clear
straw
topped
by
a
finger
of
sturdy
white
foam
the
nose
comprises
green
apple
skin
honey
and
light
pineapple
i
honestly
didnt
see
that
much
fruit
coming
the
taste
holds
notes
of
sourdough
orange
rind
lemon
zest
honey
and
bitter
greens
the
body
straddles
the
border
between
heavy
light
and
light
medium
with
a
light
moderate
carbonation
and
a
creamy
feel
overall
a
nice
brew
but
one
that
doesnt
really
excite
me
too
much
still
a
pleasant
drink
though
o
good
example
of
a
helles
lager
seems
a
bit
higher
than
4
5
o
overall
this
is
a
style
that
is
new
to
me
so
i
cant
give
great
commentary
on
how
this
beer
stacks
up
for
the
style
but
what
i
can
say
is
that
i
enjoyed
it
very
german
lagery
with
a
touch
of
pilsner
when
reviewing
beers
i
always
try
to
judge
them
by
the
style
and
not
by
how
much
i
like
that
particular
style
i
dont
buy
a
lot
of
helles
lager
i
prefer
americanstyle
ipas
porters
and
stouts
but
a
helles
lager
is
what
this
is
and
it
would
be
unfair
to
bash
it
simply
because
im
not
a
huge
fan
of
helles
lagers
that
said
i
will
simply
say
that
this
was
a
really
good
helles
lager
and
i
probably
wont
buy
it
again
for
a
long
long
time
o
very
nice
especially
on
a
nice
summer
night
like
tonight
i
would
recommend
this
and
purchase
it
again
but
the
price
was
a
little
too
much
for
the
style
a
very
good
introductory
craft
brew
for
beginners
this
beer
pours
a
light
straw
color
with
a
loose
head
it
smells
grassy
and
clean
the
taste
is
pleasant
and
refreshing
and
the
mouthfeel
accentuates
these
qualities
the
finish
is
fast
and
clean
this
beer
is
an
easy
drinker
not
one
of
my
top
lagers
but
it
is
not
bad
o
a
summer
release
for
sure
as
it
probably
wouldnt
be
as
enjoyable
on
days
other
than
100
degree
ones
but
it
was
crisp
and
refreshing
but
nothing
overpowering
for
a
lager
it
was
more
well
rounded
than
most
but
some
more
subtle
flavors
needed
to
be
present
to
make
this
more
addicting
overall
this
is
three
floyds
i
have
had
a
recent
lager
renaissance
and
this
one
just
seems
dull
in
comparison
to
most
a
relatively
simple
traditional
style
but
i
feel
they
missed
the
mark
on
this
one
i
dont
think
there
should
be
any
diacetyl
in
this
style
their
patented
citrus
hop
twist
would
have
been
welcomed
by
me
well
they
all
cant
be
winners
overall
slightly
better
than
average
for
the
style
but
im
just
not
thrilled
wheres
the
interesting
fff
slant
on
the
classic
style
easily
my
least
favorite
fff
seasonal
not
because
it
is
a
lager
but
because
it
is
so
uninspired
o
i
find
gorch
fock
to
be
a
pleasant
sessionable
beer
that
while
not
typical
of
style
falls
well
within
its
parameters
a
really
wellmade
lager
that
i
highly
recommend
o
a
spirited
attempt
at
a
nontraditional
style
the
results
of
which
i
thoroughly
enjoyed
while
it
might
not
take
the
prize
from
weihenstephaner
which
i
wasnt
expecting
in
the
least
it
definitely
gives
the
midwest
an
excellent
example
of
this
often
overlooked
european
style
and
if
you
can
produce
a
good
helles
it
says
loads
about
your
brewery
in
my
opinion
just
another
reason
why
the
boys
in
munster
should
be
proud
pours
a
clear
gold
color
two
inch
head
of
a
white
color
great
retention
and
great
lacing
smells
of
citrus
hops
slight
grain
slight
wheat
sweet
malt
and
slight
pale
malt
fits
the
style
of
a
munich
helles
lager
mouth
feel
is
sharp
and
crisp
with
a
high
carbonation
level
tastes
of
slight
citrus
hops
sweet
malt
pale
malt
hint
of
grain
hint
of
earthy
malt
and
slight
alcohol
overall
good
appearance
body
and
blend
o
the
price
was
a
bit
high
for
this
that
being
said
its
still
a
fantastic
summer
time
beer
and
a
great
example
of
a
daintier
german
style
beer
id
love
to
have
this
available
in
a
sixer
for
a
more
modest
price
o
i
am
interested
in
trying
this
again
i
wonder
if
i
had
an
older
bottle
because
after
talking
with
other
bas
and
enthusiasts
and
they
all
enjoyed
it
i
typically
enjoy
drinking
the
style
and
this
one
smelled
correctly
overall
like
i
said
before
i
dont
know
if
this
is
a
old
bottle
but
it
was
just
ok
nothing
special
wasnt
terrible
but
i
would
not
be
seeking
this
one
out
again
im
a
little
let
down
though
bought
this
8
bucks
for
a
22oz
expecting
something
special
from
three
floyds
nothin
special
d
one
of
my
least
favorite
three
floyds
i
have
had
better
in
this
style
just
didnt
work
for
me
not
awful
but
no
need
to
seek
this
out
honestly
i
was
a
bit
disappointed
with
this
one
its
good
but
ive
grown
to
expect
more
from
fff
d
i
poured
the
rest
of
this
down
the
drain
for
9
99
a
bottle
i
would
expect
something
way
better
i
love
fffs
but
this
isnt
the
one
to
go
out
of
your
way
for
by
any
stretch
drinkablity
is
soso
with
the
super
bone
dry
finish
being
too
much
as
well
as
overboard
on
carbonation
the
slight
sticky
mouth
feel
also
takes
away
a
bit
but
no
real
off
flavors
and
drinks
well
at
4
5
not
my
favorite
of
the
three
floyds
beers
pours
a
nice
semi
hazy
orange
to
gold
color
with
a
fizze
1
finger
head
and
plenty
of
carbonation
pretty
good
looking
pour
smells
of
sweet
malts
with
biscuits
and
hops
not
overpowering
but
smells
pretty
good
taste
is
delicious
this
held
up
pretty
well
nice
sweet
malt
finish
with
doughs
and
herbal
notes
up
front
mouthfeel
is
semi
thin
with
lots
of
carbonation
drinkability
is
solid
i
really
enjoyed
this
brew
and
would
love
to
grab
some
fresh
this
spring
if
it
is
released
still
another
winner
from
fff
a
delicious
lager
that
has
a
very
clean
finish
i
can
really
only
define
this
as
how
a
macro
lager
shoud
taste
a
malty
backbone
compliments
a
hoppy
finish
overall
real
tasfy
beer
that
ahpuld
peobably
become
a
year
round
brew
pours
a
moderately
dark
yellow
with
a
nice
white
head
smell
is
doughy
sweet
malt
with
traces
of
hops
fairly
simple
but
well
executed
taste
is
quite
as
clean
mouthfeel
is
light
to
medium
with
good
carbonation
and
nice
body
good
drinkability
but
not
my
favorte
three
floyds
beer
torn
envelope
reveals
what
i
already
suspected
time
to
cross
this
one
off
my
wants
this
might
just
be
one
of
the
best
ive
had
of
the
style
thanks
jamnes
d
this
was
a
light
and
refreshing
beer
the
fact
that
this
came
from
fff
makes
me
impressed
with
floyds
as
a
whole
they
know
what
they
are
doing
with
styles
and
when
they
want
to
make
something
that
follows
the
guide
lines
then
they
do
a
damn
good
job
of
doing
it
the
highest
rated
part
could
easily
down
a
few
bombers
of
this
in
a
night
low
alochol
and
lightbodied
makes
it
go
down
fast
and
smooth
overall
not
exactly
the
type
of
beer
fff
is
know
for
but
ive
never
known
these
guys
to
faulter
no
matter
what
they
do
very
drinkable
and
would
be
perfect
for
a
nice
warm
day
like
today
sitting
out
in
the
back
yard
gorch
fock
is
a
pretty
drinkable
traditional
munich
helles
lager
that
i
am
glad
i
got
to
try
once
i
could
use
a
little
bit
more
spicy
hops
though
also
i
have
to
say
that
i
will
never
buy
this
beer
again
because
at
ten
bucks
a
bomber
there
are
better
cheaper
options
this
is
a
great
beer
to
enjoy
cold
in
warm
weather
d
highly
drinkable
very
sessionable
this
is
probably
one
of
the
best
lagers
ive
had
in
a
long
time
its
a
hard
style
to
make
a
good
beer
in
but
fff
has
done
a
great
job
on
this
one
i
found
this
to
be
a
very
engaging
beer
pour
was
light
copper
with
moderate
head
very
smooth
up
front
with
toasted
grain
and
honey
sweetness
quickly
ramping
down
on
a
slighty
tart
glide
to
a
finishing
moderate
bitterness
the
beer
is
bigger
than
the
classic
style
but
close
enough
within
the
bounds
to
be
a
legitimate
classification
drinkability
was
very
good
a
tasty
lightish
lager
that
shines
in
its
hop
fragrance
but
turns
into
a
sweeter
grainy
taste
otherwise
breadiness
returns
in
the
aftertaste
d
i
like
to
envision
the
eponymous
author
sailing
the
eponymous
ship
in
valhalla
when
i
drink
this
brew
it
makes
it
even
better
drinkability
is
the
only
thing
aggressive
about
this
beer
i
know
a
number
of
people
are
disappointed
in
this
one
but
i
have
to
say
i
am
supremely
impressed
by
3f
this
is
a
wholly
serviceable
helles
and
i
certainly
applaud
them
for
making
such
a
beautiful
summertime
thirst
quencher
not
bad
but
nothing
special
which
is
odd
for
3
floyds
poured
with
a
smallish
cream
colored
short
lived
head
and
no
lace
color
is
an
almost
clear
amber
aroma
is
malt
cereal
fresh
beer
fresh
cut
grass
color
is
malt
grain
slighlty
bitter
more
sweet
body
is
a
touch
on
the
heavy
side
ok
carbonation
finish
is
like
flavor
wouldnt
pay
this
much
money
again
for
a
beer
like
this
this
ones
a
pounder
for
sure
i
think
a
one
liter
mug
is
in
order
22
ounce
bottle
served
in
a
pilsner
glass
the
beer
pours
a
somewhat
cloudy
gold
color
with
a
couple
inch
frothy
white
head
head
retention
is
good
lacing
is
decent
aroma
is
mostly
bready
malt
and
floral
hops
but
i
also
pick
up
a
little
bit
of
a
citrusy
aroma
taste
is
similar
to
the
aroma
but
theres
the
addition
of
some
spicy
hops
mouthfeelbody
is
light
its
crisp
refreshing
and
is
well
carbonated
the
soft
carbonation
helps
make
this
an
easy
brew
to
drink
it
would
be
pretty
nice
to
drink
on
a
hot
day
i
think
this
is
a
decent
overall
brew
i
liked
it
this
is
a
reasonably
drinkable
beer
that
i
can
see
enjoying
occasionally
but
nothing
that
particularly
stands
out
it
is
also
not
quite
warm
enough
outside
yet
which
may
improve
the
overall
experience
found
a
bottle
of
this
out
in
hudson
over
the
weekend
pours
a
nice
deep
golden
yellow
with
a
nice
white
head
smells
of
sweetness
with
slight
fruit
notes
taste
is
very
smooth
slight
sweet
with
a
subtle
bitterness
at
the
end
very
solid
overall
also
come
with
a
sweet
label
had
on
tap
1
5
years
later
and
not
so
great
poured
from
a
22
oz
bomber
pours
a
pils
yellow
with
a
quick
dissa
pating
head
that
leaves
a
white
ring
and
very
little
lacing
the
smell
is
floral
crisp
hops
with
german
malts
and
a
bready
smell
the
taste
is
sweet
and
floral
and
crisp
with
a
nice
malt
finish
i
taste
the
hops
in
this
one
and
the
malts
its
nicely
balanced
flavorful
and
drinkable
its
medium
bodied
crisp
and
clean
a
good
pilslagerhelles
as
always
3fff
adds
a
little
extra
to
the
style
and
this
one
is
no
exception
would
like
to
see
these
in
sixers
i
could
put
a
few
of
these
away
in
the
summer
time
mouthfeel
is
light
and
carbonation
is
above
average
drinkability
is
pretty
good
its
light
crisp
refreshing
and
also
pretty
good
tasting
its
not
something
i
would
buy
very
often
but
its
a
good
representation
of
the
style
d
tasty
goes
down
very
easily
not
too
filling
mild
kick
very
good
representation
of
style
this
is
an
excellent
sessionable
lighter
lager
that
is
worth
pounding
down
for
a
long
time
d
not
a
bad
beer
but
think
it
is
not
my
style
d
this
is
extremely
drinkable
but
im
not
sure
i
want
another
rather
boring
overall
however
this
style
is
not
known
for
being
overly
complex
i
was
on
a
3
floyds
kick
and
decided
to
give
this
on
a
try
as
well
after
alpha
king
and
gumball
head
i
was
hoping
for
another
homerun
instead
what
i
got
was
a
beer
that
felt
very
ordinary
in
comparison
it
poured
out
a
nice
golden
color
and
the
nose
was
okay
but
nothing
overly
inticing
the
first
drink
was
slighty
disappointing
seemingly
just
another
import
lager
however
as
i
continued
to
drink
this
seeminginly
boring
lager
caramel
and
buttery
flavors
emerged
and
its
dry
almost
spicy
finish
made
each
drink
more
enjoyable
while
not
a
great
invidual
beer
i
could
see
this
being
a
spectacular
session
beer
well
done
version
of
a
helles
with
a
crisp
yet
easy
feel
and
enough
spicy
hops
to
help
balance
a
lot
of
that
big
sweetness
nothing
really
abnormal
here
per
the
usual
m
o
of
fff
just
a
flavorful
and
nice
drinking
lager
cloudy
muddled
mess
of
a
beer
deep
golden
body
with
a
murkiness
that
ive
not
seen
in
a
helles
lager
before
nice
waft
sof
warm
bready
and
biscuity
malt
aromas
arise
from
the
beer
right
after
the
pour
also
some
sweet
adjunct
like
smellls
solid
flavor
of
gentle
bready
maltiness
overall
sweetness
is
held
in
check
and
i
dont
get
any
adjunct
like
flavors
hops
merely
balance
maybe
add
just
a
bit
of
a
ghostly
pepper
note
slight
fruitiness
is
noted
body
is
round
and
hefty
medium
to
mediumfull
moderately
carbonated
and
easy
to
drink
solid
flavorful
beer
not
quite
as
badass
as
i
have
come
to
expect
from
most
of
fffs
brews
though
that
cant
be
said
to
count
against
it
overall
a
great
session
beer
from
the
boys
at
3
floyds
i
could
definatley
sit
back
with
a
sixer
of
this
beer
drink
highly
drinkable
could
happily
session
with
this
beer
this
beer
could
be
a
staple
in
my
fridge
however
im
taken
back
by
the
price
for
a
22
ounce
bomber
bottle
at
9
50
from
my
supplier
which
makes
it
awfully
pricey
for
what
you
get
here
d
smooth
flavorful
and
easy
to
drink
a
nice
summer
beer
d
a
really
really
good
helles
lager
that
gives
weihenstephaner
original
a
run
for
its
money
an
unsung
member
of
the
fff
family
pours
a
mediumdeep
gold
with
a
moderate
sized
head
that
quickly
diminishes
and
leaves
little
if
any
lacing
smells
of
straw
and
hops
but
it
is
subtle
very
good
taste
of
slightly
spicy
hoppiness
and
citrus
notes
good
mouthfeel
with
rounded
yet
full
presence
this
is
a
very
drinkable
beer
especially
in
warmer
sumer
weather
though
i
consider
the
brewery
a
local
one
i
am
not
necessarily
the
biggest
three
floyds
fan
this
however
is
a
very
solid
brew
that
i
heartily
recommend
d
very
drinkable
great
for
the
style
and
pretty
solid
overall
no
head
of
which
to
speak
color
was
a
hazy
goldenyellow
nose
smelled
of
saaz
hops
lager
ok
but
more
like
a
german
pils
mouthfeel
was
medium
with
a
saazhops
flavor
on
the
tongue
finish
was
mild
bananaish
saazy
a
little
hefeweizen
an
interesting
mix
of
a
number
of
styles
rotation
not
available
here
if
it
was
i
could
see
getting
this
once
maybe
twice
a
season
maybe
more
if
in
6
packs
would
try
on
tap
for
sure
then
i
tasted
it
and
realized
it
was
a
helles
an
immensely
flavorful
helles
but
not
particularly
innovative
still
gorgeously
brewed
big
botanicals
start
things
off
with
nodes
of
grass
and
pollen
moving
into
a
dry
hop
middle
and
ending
on
sour
hops
and
light
flowers
really
nice
well
done
d
an
easy
drinker
that
could
easily
be
sessionable
however
the
lack
of
hop
character
from
a
3f
brew
is
a
bit
disappointing
i
wouldnt
consider
it
100
true
to
the
style
but
it
does
add
a
bit
more
flavor
than
the
average
munich
lager
d
easy
to
drink
just
not
my
favorite
from
three
floyds
i
poured
this
into
a
pilsiner
glass
the
color
is
a
classic
golden
however
more
cloudy
than
i
expected
the
head
was
fluffy
and
white
and
reduced
rather
quickly
the
nose
is
bready
and
slightly
skunky
the
taste
is
light
and
refreshing
almost
has
what
i
would
consider
kolsch
characteristics
it
is
well
balanced
good
cereal
malt
with
a
nice
hop
balance
the
mouthfeel
is
crisp
but
not
thin
this
beer
is
quite
drinkable
again
i
feel
i
paid
too
much
for
this
beer
at
10
99
for
a
bomber
i
could
do
a
lot
better
with
comparable
imports
i
guess
three
floyds
has
got
my
number
since
i
buy
every
bottle
they
put
out
but
most
of
them
only
once
cmon
guys
i
understand
big
prices
for
your
big
beers
but
22oz
of
lager
thats
a
little
steep
served
in
a
pint
glass
had
a
clear
pale
golden
color
with
a
medium
sized
white
head
smells
slightly
of
a
german
yeast
strain
and
sulfur
taste
was
very
sweet
breadlike
character
with
a
hint
of
fresh
grain
in
the
finish
bitterness
levels
match
up
to
balance
the
beer
decent
mouthfeel
carbonation
levels
are
nice
and
low
quite
drinkable
low
alcohol
content
makes
this
a
good
session
beer
one
of
the
best
helles
style
lagers
ive
had
im
not
sure
why
i
didnt
try
this
one
sooner
perhaps
its
the
8
50
price
tag
for
a
helles
lager
its
actually
as
good
or
better
than
many
authentic
german
versions
great
beer
though
it
would
be
way
more
appealing
if
it
was
available
in
six
packs
at
a
decent
price
it
would
probably
be
my
main
session
beer
then
drinkability
a
pleasant
surprisingly
authentic
helles
pass
the
knockwurst
and
hot
german
potato
salad
please
overall
not
the
best
example
but
ok
drinking
dont
break
your
back
to
get
this
but
check
it
out
if
available
a
bit
bland
looking
but
otherwise
this
is
a
great
session
lager
in
my
opinion
its
a
interesting
stretch
from
three
floyds
it
shows
more
restraint
and
modesty
then
most
of
their
beers
it
reminded
me
a
lot
of
prima
pils
from
victory
and
there
is
nothing
wrong
with
that
the
grassy
hops
flavor
added
to
both
the
smell
and
the
flavor
this
is
a
summer
beer
perfect
for
a
picnic
pours
a
hazey
and
very
light
beige
mixed
with
light
amber
and
hay
yellow
not
much
head
or
foam
period
rich
pilsner
malt
of
mild
toastiness
in
the
aroma
great
grassy
hop
aroma
gives
the
scent
an
earthy
aire
flavors
of
toasted
malt
overall
but
also
piney
grassy
and
some
faint
unwashed
strawberry
from
jewel
come
through
great
malty
earthy
and
semidry
mouthfeel
make
this
helles
super
sessionable
d
very
drinkable
if
this
was
available
in
texas
during
the
summer
i
could
kill
a
few
of
these
on
a
hot
summer
day
d
could
definitely
enjoy
a
few
as
with
most
any
brew
from
fff
definitely
drinkable
very
drinkable
the
aroma
is
typical
for
the
style
with
corn
like
malt
and
grassy
malt
the
appearance
is
golden
with
a
large
head
the
flavor
is
like
the
aroma
the
palate
is
average
for
the
style
overall
this
is
pretty
typical
of
the
style
i
know
its
a
quality
beer
but
i
would
pass
on
this
mouthfeel
was
slick
and
somewhat
prickly
medium
bodied
d
good
brew
could
definitely
drink
a
case
of
this
in
a
sitting
its
definitely
not
one
of
those
beers
you
can
only
have
a
couple
of
drinkability
i
could
definitely
knock
back
a
few
more
of
these
citrus
and
melon
assert
themselves
more
as
the
session
continues
this
is
the
perfect
fit
for
a
warm
winter
day
in
san
luis
obispo
d
very
drinkable
id
be
content
with
another
bottle
or
two
poured
a
clear
yellow
with
no
head
slight
aroma
of
sweet
melon
with
some
light
spice
light
bodied
on
the
taste
with
a
touch
of
honey
sweetness
on
the
nose
crisp
clean
with
a
nice
hop
bitterness
very
easy
drinking
d
its
light
but
not
good
enough
to
want
to
drink
d
this
is
a
great
fall
lager
i
am
really
impressed
with
this
too
bad
it
wasnt
cheaper
overall
good
but
too
bland
to
warrant
another
try
d
it
is
a
tasty
brew
that
is
easy
on
the
tongue
and
light
on
the
abv
it
would
make
for
a
great
session
beer
d
like
the
big
boys
say
this
beer
tastes
great
and
is
less
filling
not
my
favorite
style
due
to
its
muted
flavors
and
aromas
but
i
can
certainly
appreciate
the
craftsmanship
here
this
beer
would
pair
very
well
with
food
and
at
4
5
abv
its
certainly
sessionable
okay
so
its
not
as
leftofcenter
stylewise
as
something
like
gumballhead
and
not
your
typical
three
floyds
offering
in
any
way
its
not
overloaded
with
hops
andor
alcohol
but
very
much
like
most
other
three
floyds
stuff
in
that
its
a
quality
product
expertly
conceived
and
lovingly
crafted
the
name
and
label
as
with
all
3f
stuff
is
just
awesome
icing
on
a
tasty
cake
d
superbly
drinkable
dont
mistake
this
for
a
bland
lager
this
has
a
wonderful
complexity
excellent
for
sipping
outstanding
session
potential
well
done
version
of
the
style
would
love
to
have
this
available
id
get
it
again
without
question
pours
a
slightly
hazed
pale
golden
with
a
small
white
aroma
is
medium
sweet
with
some
grass
light
fruit
and
bread
flavor
is
bread
fruit
light
grass
and
light
citrus
light
body
very
clean
texture
something
a
little
out
of
the
normal
for
three
floyds
but
altogether
a
good
beer
the
body
is
light
to
moderate
a
bit
full
for
style
overall
if
i
were
to
judge
this
i
would
say
that
it
fermented
to
high
with
too
much
finishing
hops
and
too
much
malt
as
a
consumer
though
this
is
definitely
pushing
the
style
to
more
of
an
america
character
with
more
body
and
flavor
pours
a
orangeish
copper
color
with
a
small
white
head
in
the
aroma
a
grainy
small
sweet
malt
in
the
taste
a
small
sweet
maltiness
and
fresh
a
smooth
and
medium
mouthfeel
with
a
small
semi
dry
to
clean
aftertaste
very
fresh
cleanand
nice
with
just
a
touch
of
fruit
da
lager
from
fff
and
they
do
it
up
the
fff
way
with
a
bit
more
hops
and
character
than
is
usual
and
of
course
it
works
a
good
beer
overall
when
added
together
the
sum
is
greater
than
the
parts
wish
i
would
have
bought
more
of
this
prost
really
a
dead
ringer
for
the
style
and
a
damn
tasty
lager
though
i
dont
know
if
its
so
good
that
i
would
pay
another
9
bucks
for
a
bomber
nevertheless
really
well
done
the
descriptor
for
the
aroma
is
nearly
identical
to
the
flavor
cereal
grains
show
through
more
however
with
a
slight
sweetness
that
really
shines
through
on
the
finish
lightly
hopped
to
match
the
malt
and
give
a
hint
of
bitterness
on
the
end
an
unbelievably
easy
drinking
helles

good

from

a
good
beer
a
nice
helles
but
not
3fs
best
overall
a
tasty
and
easy
drinking
lager
the
sweetness
was
a
bit
annoying
but
not
too
overpowering
ive
had
the
pleasure
of
drinking
many
helles
lagers
in
munich
so
i
was
hoping
that
3f
would
keep
to
the
style
with
this
in
my
opinion
they
did
an
excellent
job
of
not
getting
all
hoppy
on
it
this
was
a
very
good
helles
lager
pours
a
somewhat
foggy
light
golden
hue
with
a
one
finger
white
head
that
quickly
dies
down
to
a
whispy
layer
of
foam
lots
of
bubbles
racing
to
the
top
of
the
glass
with
virtually
no
lacing
left
on
the
sides
smell
begins
with
faint
grains
lemon
and
honey
you
really
have
to
dig
your
nose
deep
just
to
get
these
aromas
so
unfortunately
this
is
about
it
taste
starts
off
with
a
buttery
biscuit
like
malt
with
a
hint
of
lemon
toasted
grains
some
noble
hops
midway
on
the
tongue
aftertaste
is
moist
with
honey
fresh
cut
grass
a
pinch
of
pepper
light
smooth
and
creamy
in
the
mouth
with
a
steady
but
subtle
carbonation
not
a
bad
beer
but
nothing
id
seek
out
again
thanks
again
3fs
for
another
fine
interpretation
of
a
beer
style
d
why
would
i
want
another
i
doubt
that
this
style
is
as
poor
as
this
beer
is
im
going
to
have
to
look
for
another
by
the
way
if
im
the

director
i
start

i

its
a

oh

at

this
tasty
bad

will
be
enjoyable
for
quite
a
time

poured
a
clear
golden
yellow
color
lager
with
a
medium
foamy
head
with
limited
retention
and
no
lacing
aroma
of
sweet
lightly
floral
malt
with
limited
hops
presence
which
i
the
biggest
surprise
coming
from
a
brewery
renowned
for
hopping
every
beer
to
the
maximum
level
taste
is
also
dominated
by
some
sweet
and
lightly
floral
notes
with
a
minimal
amount
of
crisp
hops
at
the
end
full
body
with
average
carbonation
good
take
on
the
style
form
a
brewery
not
usually
known
for
sticking
to
style
glad
i
picked
one
of
these
up
if
they
were
more
readily
available
here
i
could
easily
see
drinking
more
d
i
must
say
im
surprised
that
fff
pulled
in
the
reins
so
hard
on
one
of
their
beers
to
keep
in
instyle
at
under
5
abv
instead
of
pushing
the
envelope
like
they
normally
do
this
is
highly
drinkable
and
very
well
balanced
the
mouthfeel
is
very
crisp
and
light
in
body
the
flavors
meld
wonderfully
over
the
palate
subtlety
is
a
beautiful
thing
i
could
drink
this
beer
all
day
this
22oz
bottle
will
go
down
within
the
next
5
minutes
i
reckon
a
light
golden
to
straw
color
with
a
small
white
head
forming
but
it
quickly
dissolve
away
there
is
strong
visibility
of
carbonation
a
slight
grassy
scent
at
first
followed
by
a
strong
bready
cracked
grain
aroma
that
bready
fragrance
is
strong
at
the
first
taste
it
quickly
blends
itself
with
mild
bitterness
of
citrus
and
grassy
flavors
a
watery
feel
at
first
carbonation
does
become
prevalent
halfway
across
the
palate
it
has
the
classic
feel
of
a
very
good
lager
crisp
with
a
dry
finish
a
surprise
from
fff
this
beer
sticks
to
the
style
very
well
though
a
little
thinner
of
a
feel
than
expected
it
is
still
a
very
good
beer
would
be
good
some
steamed
seafood
d
nice
flavor
overall
with
good
balance
this
beer
is
anything
but
thrilling
but
makes
for
a
decent
beverage
very
drinkable
pretty
light
with
good
flavor
smooth
nice
dry
and
clean
finish
i
want
another
definitely
the
best
example
of
this
style
very
impressive
and
from
an
american
brewer
taste
is
strong
of
pine
grass
pilsner
funk
no
noticable
alcohol
no
surprise
at
4
5
feels
a
little
thin
but
leaves
a
nice
hoppy
aftertaste
that
sticks
around
a
while
lagers
arent
my
choice
of
beer
but
this
one
seems
pretty
well
done
d
keeping
the
style
in
mind
this
is
a
really
good
beer
i
wouldnt
usually
buy
this
beer
but
for
a
time
where
it
calls
for
a
nice
lager
this
would
be
the
one
i
would
seek
out
probably
the
best
lighter
lager
i
have
had
so
imo
three
floyds
are
staying
strong
with
another
good
offering
for
a
great
session
beer
overall
three
floyds
is
in
my
opinion
the
best
brewery
in
the
us
and
possibly
the
world
this
beer
sadly
let
me
down
thank
god
i
have
a
dark
lord
to
get
my
hopes
back
up
i
would
say
try
it
for
the
experience
but
dont
get
your
hopes
up
gorch
fock
is
one
of
the
best
munich
helles
lagers
that
ive
ever
had
it
proves
the
point
that
didnt
need
proving
that
three
floyds
is
anything
but
a
dump
in
a
massive
amount
of
hops
and
see
what
happens
kind
of
brewery
these
guys
are
craftsmen
dammit
forgetting
the
german
origins
of
this
beer
for
a
moment
theyre
also
one
of
the
best
brewers
of
american
style
beer
on
the
planet
maybe
the
best
what
a
change
of
pace
for
three
floyds
here
i
really
like
this
one
but
as
other
reviewers
point
out
its
a
bit
pricy
very
accessible
and
highly
sessionable
if
the
price
wasnt
so
steep
i
was
very
surprised
at
how
mediocre
this
was
considering
i
worship
3fs
its
probably
the
first
of
their
offerings
that
didnt
blow
me
away
or
was
at
least
an
interesting
and
tasty
interpretion
of
a
beer
style
i
could
sum
this
up
quickly
by
saying
that
its
a
standard
helles
lager
but
ill
go
on
this
poured
a
pale
gold
with
a
chill
haze
and
a
minimal
white
head
that
diminished
very
quickly
some
nice
bready
malt
aromas
and
maybe
a
hint
of
grassy
hops
in
the
nose
some
sweet
malts
balanced
out
by
the
underlying
hops
and
carbonation
mouthfeel
is
fine
drinkable
at
this
abv
im
wondering
why
they
bottled
such
a
run
of
the
mill
beer
when
ive
had
much
better
offerings
at
the
pub
admiral
lord
nelson
for
example
also
this
is
way
overpriced
at
7
a
bomber
you
could
get
a
sixer
of
spaten
for
that
which
is
not
much
different
and
a
bit
better
heres
to
you
mj
toasttouch
glass
d
this
beer
has
a
nice
smooth
flavor
and
with
a
slightly
stronger
taste
of
hops
than
malt
the
flavor
and
aroma
are
both
very
light
and
there
isnt
much
depth
to
either
of
them
and
i
dont
get
that
fresh
malt
and
hops
flavor
that
i
like
to
see
in
lagers
slightly
lacking
in
vitality
although
the
thickness
seems
about
right
the
taste
is
excellent
however
and
my
recent
fling
with
german
beer
leaves
me
finding
this
a
very
welcome
interpretation
of
the
style
think
gumballhead
goes
to
bavaria
d
pretty
refreshing
not
my
favorite
style
of
beer
but
for
what
it
is
its
pretty
darn
good
drinkability
this
is
decent
beer
but
not
inspiring
so
to
me
it
is
not
sessionable
on
tap
at
three
floyds
brewpub
and
served
in
a
pint
glass
this
beer
poured
a
clear
golden
color
with
a
small
beige
head
the
aroma
was
made
up
of
bread
very
light
pine
and
some
lemony
citrus
notes
the
flavor
was
also
very
mild
and
included
light
bready
yeast
and
citrus
the
mouthfeel
was
light
and
had
a
small
dose
of
carbonation
a
solid
representation
of
the
style
worth
a
try
poured
a
hazy
yellow
with
a
nice
white
head
on
top
smell
was
of
faint
floral
spice
and
a
little
yeast
taste
was
crisp
dry
and
of
spicy
hop
very
drinkable
i
had
no
problem
sitting
back
with
this
one
while
waiting
for
food
it
was
rather
light
compared
to
most
of
the
other
offerings
by
3
floyds
and
for
that
i
enjoyed
it
sessionable
id
say
enters
the
mouth
mellow
nutty
rich
well
balanced
even
nutty
richness
on
the
palate
that
yeilds
to
a
bold
boppy
bitter
finish
bitter
feel
stays
on
mouth
maybe
a
little
to
much
mouthfeel
is
smooth
and
crisp
easy
drinking
and
quite
refreshing
a
good
change
of
pace
from
all
the
huge
beers
i
was
sampling
earlier
in
the
day
i
look
forward
to
some
more
interesting
brews
from
the
ever
expanding
floyds
plus
its
hard
to
resist
telling
your
buddies
to
gorch
fock
off
the
light
body
and
firm
carbonation
combine
to
make
a
really
nice
warm
weather
refresher
this
is
one
of
the
best
lagers
ive
ever
had
its
so
unique
and
tasty
if
you
are
looking
for
a
meaty
smoke
youll
have
to
go
elsewhere
this
is
more
of
a
good
campfire
smoke
not
overpowering
but
definitely
present
as
with
most
decent
beer
let
it
warm
a
bit
if
you
are
pulling
it
out
of
a
typically
cold
fridge
the
outstanding
flavor
profile
is
intense
a
bit
complex
and
very
well
balanced
it
begins
with
a
mixture
of
flavors
that
slowly
separate
into
a
mild
oak
like
smokiness
over
a
subtle
sweet
biscuit
in
the
middle
it
becomes
rather
crisp
and
becomes
dryer
towards
the
finish
a
slightly
bitter
smokiness
lingers
lighter
take
with
less
alcohol
on
a
helles
lager
excellent
and
i
would
drink
this
happily
every
day
clean
crisp
lightly
sweet
and
full
of
enough
flavor
to
keep
you
interested
glass
after
glass
the
best
of
both
worlds
a
lager
with
a
wonderfully
light
and
smoky
flavor
this
is
the
real
deal
perfect
carbonation

yeah
about
that
bamberg
vacation
o
can
not
wait
to
vist
bamberg
rjt
you
can
tell
that
a
lot
of
time
and
skill
went
into
this
brew
funnily
enough
a
slight
tea
flavour
not
at
all
out
of
place
real
complement
o
superb
so
much
going
on
here
and
at
4
3
gives
the
lie
to
the
theory
that
high
abv
always
means
more
flavour
i
have
had
this
beer
several
times
now
since
my
original
review
and
im
consistently
impressed
by
it
each
time
i
pop
one
open
its
like
having
it
for
the
first
time
a
beer
i
could
just
drink
endlessly
im
increasing
my
ratings
for
taste
and
overall
for
each
as
i
really
cant
see
this
beer
improving
in
those
aspects
an
interesting
twist
to
the
style
the
smokeless
smokiness
gives
it
a
grunge
homemade
vibe
this
is
probably
not
their
best
offering
but
it
does
make
me
want
to
keep
an
eye
out
for
their
real
smoked
beers
price
point

9
oz
bottle
interesting
taste
of
subtle
smoke
paired
with
lagerstyle
freshness
its
unique
to
create
a
rather
light
lager
beer
with
so
much
flavor
compared
to
the
original
aecht
schlenkerla
this
is
the
best
solution
because
you
will
be
able
to
enjoy
a
toned
down
smoke
flavor
with
a
not
so
heavy
beer
it
is
unfortunate
that
it
costs
me
5
99bottle
here
in
san
francisco
whereas
it
costs
1
in
germany
never
had
a
smoked
helles
before
it
was
interesting
although
with
a
few
off
notes
i
guess
schlenkerla
are
really
great
at
crafting
dark
liquid
bacon
but
this
helles
was
a
bit
of
a
let
down
o
its
amazing
that
this
beer
isnt
talked
about
more
it
has
great
balance
its
refreshing
crisp
packed
with
flavor
and
4

abv
doesnt
get
much
better
o
was
hoping
for
a
bit
more
out
of
this
considering
how
wonderfully
flavorful
some
of
their
other
beers
are
the
low
level
of
smoke
flavor
wasnt
necessarily
a
bad
thing
come
to
think
of
it
the
last
time
i
had
a
bland
schlenkerla
on
tap
the
lent
beer
it
was
at
brauhaus
hmmm
o
good
lager
with
just
a
touch
of
smoke
i
think
it
could
use
more
but
its
quite
refreshing
that
said
this
beer
sucks
the
smoke
over
powers
the
already
soft
flavor
of
the
helles
this
was
a
drain
pour
for
me
very
interesting
stuff
a
clear
light
bavarian
helles
with
fine
and
firm
head
the
subtle
smoke
aroma
makes
this
a
unique
beer
much
more
drinkable
than
the
schlenkerla
rauchbier
malty
and
satisfying
finish
considering
its
relatively
low
alcohol
level
decent
helles
with
an
elegant
smokey
touch
but
dont
expect
bacon
or
any
heavy
ash
smokness
and
you
will
be
fine
o
very
nice
o
a
solid
helles
and
a
good
representation
of
the
style
i
still
think
there
are
better
helles
but
this
is
absolutely
worth
a
try
crisp
and
clean
with
a
mild
fruity
and
hoppy
taste
could
be
an
excellent
session
beer
highly
recommended
to
lager
fans
pours
a
fairly
clear
medium
golden
color
with
a
decent
sized
bubbly
white
head
that
slowly
dissipates
to
a
ring
on
top
rich
sweet
caramelized
pilsner
malt
dominates
the
aroma
rich
dried
fruit
prunes
and
raisins
come
to
mind
non
existent
hop
aroma
lightly
spicy
and
almost
smokey
component
shows
up
in
the
aroma
as
well
the
flavor
is
rich
with
lots
of
caramelized
sugary
maltiness
and
plenty
of
dark
dried
fruits
there
is
a
hint
of
herbal
hop
flavor
and
a
bit
of
sweet
cardboard
medium
body
with
a
fairly
dry
finish
moderate
level
of
carbonation
and
a
sweet
slick
mouthfeel
love
the
aroma
here
but
the
flavor
suggests
this
bottle
my
be
less
than
fresh
one
day
i
will
make
it
over
the
ocean
to
try
some
great
lagers
the
way
they
were
meant
to
be
drunk
overall
a
traditional
well
done
munich
helles
in
many
ways
but
with
a
watereddown
character
that
keeps
it
from
making
a
truly
positive
impression
overall
one
of
the
better
lagers
out
there
recommended
i
am
still
not
convinced
of
the
smokey
flavors
but
i
do
think
this
is
a
nice
beer
and
good
for
pairing
with
bbq
or
any
smoked
food
it
is
a
refreshing
thirst
quencher
and
sessionable
like
any
other
helles
this
beer
definitely
gots
its
place
in
the
world
and
i
might
come
back
to
it
this
is
a
fantastic
beer
i
love
smoke
side
that
this
beer
adds
to
already
well
made
beer
if
this
was
a
bit
more
reasonably
priced
i
would
drink
it
more
i
can
definitely
see
why
this
gets
brought
to
torst
and
proletariat
in
nyc
did
not
score
a
t
s
m
at
that
time
disregard
those
scores
overall
4
25
this
is
a
nice
beer
wellcrafted
and
on
point
for
the
style
the
little
bit
of
smokiness
towards
the
end
gets
washed
away
if
youre
not
careful
but
if
you
pair
it
with
food
it
gets
more
noticeable
and
offers
a
very
nice
unique
edge
that
definitely
sets
it
apart
from
the
field
very
nice
subtle
wellcrafted
and
refreshing
overall
an
odd
but
strangely
tasty
beer
id
label
this
a
gateway
for
getting
into
smoked
beers
because
while
it
doesnt
actually
use
smoked
malts
they
boil
it
in
the
same
kettles
and
use
the
same
yeast
as
the
other
smoked
beers
so
the
smoke
element
is
very
much
there
however
its
not
overpowering
and
so
very
approachable
an
extraordinary
german
lager
that
hits
all
the
style
marks
in
excellent
fashion
wellbalanced
combines
with
nice
lowkey
complexity
throughout
ive
always
liked
their
smoked
beers
and
was
hoping
their
helles
lager
would
provide
similar
satisfaction
i
was
not
disappointed
and
would
recommend
this
beer
to
anyone
without
hesitation
this
beer
is
so
fundamentally
simple
yet
executed
so
admirably
drinkability
is
insanely
high
i
couldnt
get
enough
of
this
beer
you
can
bet
that
ill
be
picking
this
one
up
from
now
on
every
time
im
looking
for
something
to
sit
back
and
relax
with
definitely
one
of
the
best
lagers
ive
had
to
date
especially
considering
the
helles
style
it
opened
my
eyes
to
what
helles
lagers
could
taste
like
o
a
very
nice
helles
good
flavor
for
low
abv
wouldnt
be
a
goto
for
me
but
would
enjoy
it
again
this
is
a
world
classic
for
me
an
outstanding
hell
in
its
own
right
with
a
lovely
hint
of
smoke
to
complement
it
everything
is
done
in
perfect
balance
here
and
having
had
it
at
the
brewery
and
at
home
in
australia
it
travels
very
well
pheonix
beers
are
good
importers
o
a
solid
helles
lager
with
a
nice
smokiness
to
it
the
smoke
is
more
of
a
supporting
role
than
anything
else
especially
compared
to
their
other
beers
and
keeps
things
interesting
very
easy
to
drink
and
easy
to
find
worth
a
purchase
overall
this
is
a
great
beer
a
delightful
lager
full
of
flavor
and
with
a
unique
and
subtle
flavor
twist
wonderful
beer
is
medium
to
mediumlight
in
body
with
moderate
to
moderatelow
levels
of
carbonation
the
resulting
mouthfeel
is
generally
smooth
and
passes
gracefully
along
the
palate
with
a
light
fizziness
and
foaminess
due
to
the
carbonation
closes
quite
dry
the
feel
being
rather
astringent
actually
enjoyable
a
lager
with
some
gentle
smoke
to
it
edit
so
apparently
this
beer
is
known
for
having
a
smoky
flavor
i
had
no
idea
still
pretty
nice
brew
smells
vaguely
of
caribbean
lagers
which
was
offputting
however
tastes
like
a
campfire
and
had
fantastic
mouthfeel
for
something
with
such
smoky
qualities
i
was
surprised
not
to
see
that
on
the
label
although
my
translation
skills
are
nonexistent
or
very
close
to
it
greatly
enjoyed
this
beer
and
although
i
dont
look
for
lagers
would
buy
this
beer
again
when
in
the
mood
great
work
peeps
across
the
pond
a
very
nice
medium
to
light
bodied
lager
very
drinkable
and
a
fine
specimen
of
its
category
d
didnt
look
appetizing
at
all
after
a
few
minutes
aroma
and
taste
left
little
to
be
desired
no
smoke
character
as
hoped
for
just
a
standard
helles
on
the
sweeter
side
of
the
malt
spectrum
even
for
franconia
disappointed
poured
into
a
glass
mug
pours
pale
golden
with
a
white
head
i
can
see
a
few
tiny
streaming
bubbles
the
aroma
is
of
smoky
and
pale
roasted
malts
the
taste
follows
the
nose
the
good
malt
profile
has
the
right
balance
of
smokiness
to
make
the
taste
the
body
is
light
with
moderate
carbonation
the
finish
is
crisp
the
drinkability
is
very
high
this
is
an
excellent
beer
i
just
wish
the
bottle
caps
werent
on
so
tight
because
this
destroyed
my
bottle
opener
almost
medium
bodied
with
a
tart
sharp
carbonation
up
front
dry
clean
finish
sadly
ive
got
nothing
to
recommend
in
this
beer
thats
disappointing
considering
how
much
ive
liked
the
other
four
schlenkerla
brews
ive
had
prior
o
when
i
bought
this
beer
i
built
up
hopes
of
what
it
would
taste
like
after
drinking
two
other
of
the
brewerys
smoke
beers
both
very
good
this
is
a
welcomed
departure
and
a
pleasant
drinking
experience
highly
recommended
taste
is
nice
helles
with
grain
bread
herb
apple
lemon
mineral
with
light
smokiness
again
coming
on
before
the
finish
it
has
aftertaste
of
light
grain
herb
apple
its
nice
to
try
a
smoked
lager
but
eh
i
dont
see
the
appeal
in
buying
more
than
one
bottle
ever
whereas
the
brewerys
smoked
marzen
and
weizen
are
a
little
thicker
and
can
stand
up
to
the
smoke
i
think
in
some
ways
the
smoke
gets
in
the
way
of
the
lager
properties
i
usually
go
for
a
lager
as
a
lighter
more
refreshing
option
the
smoke
kills
that
im
trying
to
be
objective
with
my
scores
because
i
appreciate
the
uniqueness
this
beer
pours
a
light
bodied
and
very
clear
bright
gold
in
color
with
a
two
finger
bright
white
head
the
nose
is
trademarked
pale
german
malt
with
a
touch
of
smoke
hey
oh
ive
had
all
of
aecht
schlemkerlas
other
beers
but
didnt
expect
any
smoke
from
their
helles
for
some
reason
the
touch
of
smoke
is
a
nice
surprise
the
flavors
are
crisp
and
clean
it
features
typical
pale
munich
malt
and
again
has
that
touch
f
smoked
malt
it
definitely
makes
this
one
unique
it
drinks
light
in
body
and
is
very
easy
to
sit
down
and
drink
i
like
it
a
lot
for
anyone
who
is
a
fan
of
german
lagers
this
s
a
must
try
sampled
in
a
hobgoblin
tumbler
serious
lol
this
pours
with
a
rich
white
head
very
slightly
hazy
deep
yellow
liquid
in
the
glass
nose
is
of
bready
malt
and
the
subtle
hint
of
smokiness
very
appealing
to
my
sense
of
smell
the
taste
is
superb
a
complex
blend
of
subtle
smoke
malt
and
hops
finishes
long
and
hoppy
with
the
smoke
cutting
thru
this
is
a
fantastic
and
unique
helles
i
doubt
ive
had
better
a
gem
half
litre
bottle
golden
colour
clear
large
head
which
soon
disappeared
aroma
had
notes
of
apple
saaz
hop
and
a
hint
of
smoke
tasted
apple
and
a
hint
of
smoke
had
the
spicy
sweetness
of
oktoberfest
beers
smooth
texture
medium
body
light
carbonation
overall
a
very
refreshing
beer
the
smoke
was
understated
but
really
gave
it
some
depth
that
defied
the
4
3abv
d
a
balanced
and
drinkable
bavarian
lager
but
with
a
very
subtle
touch
of
smoke
that
takes
it
to
another
level
of
complexity
really
nice
up
there
with
the
best
of
schlenkerla
500
ml
bottle
served
in
a
pilsener
glass
the
beer
pours
a
clear
straw
gold
color
with
about
a
half
inch
offwhite
head
head
retention
and
lacing
are
both
decent
enough
the
brew
smells
like
grainbready
malt
apples
bananas
smoke
pears
and
a
bit
of
herbs
the
taste
is
just
like
the
aroma
from
what
i
can

buy
this

i
found
this
a

even
though
its
a

its

it

o
nice

with
some

i

i
really
wanted
to

this

as

as
their

dont
get
me
wrong
id
drink
this
again
i
enjoy
it
enough
to
seek
out
every
once
in

i
mean
its
still
just
a
helles
lager
i
love
both
big
and
little
smoked
malt
qualities
and
this
one
satisfies
that
thirst
of
mine

its
not

its
own

have
to
give
it

although
the

itself
doesnt

using

quality
helles
lager
here
if
you
enjoy
a
subtle
twist
on
this
traditional
munich
style
then
grab
a
bottle
of
this
drinkability
lagers
typically
go
down
easy
since
this
is
the
best
lager
ive
tried
it
goes
down
that
much
easier
my
local
beer
store
sells
this
by
the

this
could
be
a
dangerous

want
to

on
the
whole
this
is
an
average
and
forgettable
beer
not
very
interesting
a
truly
unique
and
interesting
beer
i
could
see
myself
drinking
a

of
this

i
lived

abv
ba
says

not
sure
which
is
correct
overall
a
nice
intro
to
schlenkerla
but
give
me
the
marzen
or
urbock
any
day
o
a
solid
beer
with
hint
of
the
classic
smoke
very
enjoyable
the
rest
medium
bodied
a
pretty
tasty
helles
with
some
additional
character
from
the
smokiness
d
piecewise
im
not
impressed
but
all
together
this
beer
is
pretty
nice
this
brew
is
a
first
for
me
and
it
pours
a
slightly
hazy
honey
hue
which
leaves
a
two
finger
head
that
stays
and
a
nice
rim
of
lacingthe
smell
is
honeydewthe
slightest
tinge
of

but
its
there
and
cold
meatsthe
mouthfeel
is
just
over
lightbodieddry
and
thirst
satisfying
the
taste
has
the
honeydew
and
slight
smoked
malts
along
with
a
touch
of
rockmelon
and
a
everpresent
herbal
hop
grassiness
without
the
bitterness
and
overall
its
no
standout
beer
but
a
bloody
great
session
beer
and
could
see
this
as
one
of
my
session
staple
beers
for
the
summer
cheers
o
while
this
is
a
decent
rauchbier
this
is
like
the
bud
light
of
schlenkerlas
lineup
definitely
a
gateway
to
the
bolder
rauchbiers
out
there
so
i
think
just
about
anyone
could
drink
this
worth
picking
up
to
try
if
you
see
it
around
the
beer
had
a
light
feel
to
it
exceptionally
smooth
and
easy
to
drink
overall
this
is
a
simple
beer
that
is
exceptionally
well
done
this
one
will
be
in
my
beer
fridge
more
often
this
is
a
nice
beer
it
goes
well
with
my
hamburger
and
fires
the
flavor
profile
is
simple
but
it
does
have
that
nice
aecht
shlenkarla
smokey
flavor
i
would
drink
this
again
overall
an
interesting
unique
and
enjoyable
german
lager
the
aroma
is
a
bit
underwhelming
but
the
interesting
balance
of
flavors
makes
up
for
it
notes
easy
drinking
with
a
nice
light
smoke
angle
to
set
it
apart
the
more
you
drink
it
the
more
youll
appreciate
the
subtleties
as
it
says
on
the
bottle
its
not
made
with
smoke
malt
so
be
warned
its
not
a
typical
schlenkerla
brew
cheers
i
do
like
this
beer
but
i
feel
it
falls
somewhat
short
of
the
other
offerings
from
this
brewery
it
is
not
a
whole
lot
different
than
many
other
german
lagers
d
im
definitely
a
sucker
for
smoke
but
i
think
all
would
agree
this
is
a
very
well
made
beer
highly
quaffable
more
hay
and
grainy
bready
malt
as
flavours
along
with
spicy
hops
and
some
just
noticeable
woody
smoke
finishes
with
an
assertive
bitterness
that
then
settles
down
to
reveal
some
caramel
500
ml
bottle
from
kl
pours
a
clear
light
gold
with
a
mountainous
white
head
that
lasts
forever
aroma
is
smokey
not
like
roasting
a
pig
over
a
campfire
a
la
the
other
schlenkerla
beers
but
definitely
reminiscent
thereof
subtle
notes
of
christmas
ham
along
with
the
more
typical
melanoidin
character
flavor
isnt
as
smokey
as
the
smell
bigger
emphasis
on
the
base
beer
character
with
cheeriosesque
malts
and
a
lightly
sweet
grainy
finish
there
is
a
vague
note
of
woody
smoke
throughout
but
its
never
at
the
fore
lovely
heft
to
the
body
not
too
watery
nor
too
sweet
and
fatiguing
really
hits
the
spot
it
has
a
dark
straw
color
with
a
nice
white
head
and
lace
the
aroma
is
a
little
milder
than
their
other
beers
the
smoke
is
the
dominant
flavor
and
scent
but
there
are
hay
and
citrus
esters
the
body
is
heavier
than
most
traditional
lagers
it
has
a
light
body
but
a
rough
finish
due
to
the
smokiness
overall
a
good
beer
not
to
heavy
in
smokiness
so
its
perfect
for
some
looking
to
try
hisher
first
smoke
beer
o
highly
sessionable
lager
very
suitable
for
a
hot
day
out
in
the
sun
but
there
are
more
affordable
options
available
overall
though
not
containing
any
smoked
malts
the
tanks
holding
this
beer
also
are
used
to
ferment
all
of
the
aecht
schlenkerla
rauch
line
being
a
smoked
beer
fan
i
find
this
a
very
fine
lighter
option
with
a
more
delicate
but
still
prominent
smoke
flavor
overall
very
good
beer
overall
the
smoke
enhances
the
flavor
instead
of
dominating
it
i
would
definitely
recommend
this
one
o
a
quite
complex
lager
with
a
rich
amount
of
perfectly
balanced
flavours
and
an
amazing
drinkability
maybe
just
a
little
less
refreshing
than
other
bavarian
helles
one
of
the
more
interesting
helles
lagers
ive
tried
i
like
this
beer
like
everything
ive
had
from
brauerei
heller
bamberg
its
wellcrafted
and
solid
nothing
exciting
or
flashy
here
but
if
you
want
a
good
crisp
beer
look
no
further
o
very
tasty
and
refreshingjust
a
touch
of
smoke
with
milod
hops
and
sweet
malts
this
beer
is
great
period
d
very
drinkable
crisp
refreshing
and
fairly
light
with
good
malt
character
mils
smokiness
is
really
nice
d
brauerei
hellertrum
schlenkerla
remember
the
name
every
beer
ive
had
from
them
has
been
nothing
shy
of
delicious
add
this
one
to
the
list
of
great
beers
they
brew
drinkability
a
light
pleasant
flavorful
beer
one
of
the
more
interesting
hells
i
had
the
opportunity
of
sampling
while
in
germany
a
definite
standout
i
thought
this
was
pretty
solid
the
beer
pours
a
yellow
color
with
a
white
head
the
aroma
is
a
mix
of
bready
malt
with
some
grassy
hops
a
nice
clean
smelling
german
lager
the
flavor
is
mainly
bready
and
biscuit
malt
with
some
grassy
hops
mixed
in
i
also
get
a
little
bit
of
light
grape
notes
but
they
are
pretty
faint
medium
mouthfeel
and
medium
carbonation
another
good
beer
from
a
great
brewery
decent
lager
but
pales
in
comparison
to
the
rauchs
pours
relatively
thin
yet
well
formed
creamy
white
head
that
sets
to
a
firm
cloth
atop
of
effervescent
yellow
body
with
good
clarity
the
nose
is
dominated
by
pils
malt
sweetness
while
smoke
is
virtually
nonexistent
flavor
is
pils
malt
sweetness
with
woody
smokiness
and
towards
the
dry
finish
mild
spicy
noble
hops
and
hop
bitterness
show
up
light
bodied
with
moderate
carbonation
and
somewhat
creamy
sensation
overall
the
beer
is
simple
unassuming
and
very
refreshing
but
i
have
to
admit
i
was
expecting
something
better
d
very
good
summer
drinker
the
smoke
adds
a
perfect
amount
of
punch
to
differentiate
out
from
an
ordinary
lager
this
is
a
very
good
lager
that
is
kicked
up
a
notch
by
that
hint
of
smoke
i
really
enjoyed
that
and
the
combination
of
the
interesting
taste
with
the
light
body
and
the
low
abv
make
this
a
very
drinkable
beer
id
definitely
get
it
again
recommended
love
it
beautiful
pale
hazy
yellow
with
a
white
head
the
smell
is
of
honey
almonds
and
a
bit
of
wet
grass
the
taste
is
dry
and
lightly
smokey
crisp
with
the
sweetness
in
the
midpallet
which
then
fads
nicely
and
ends
with
a
pipe
tobacco
finish
this
beers
the
shit
this
might
be
what
happens
to
lagers
when
they
die
and
go
to
heaven
m
the
smoke
makes
the
beer
a
full
flavor
that
doesnt
scorch
the
earth
a
beer
that
paired
nicely
with
several
of
the
cheeses
throughout
the
night
light
body
and
smoke
makes
for
a
refreshing
beer
not
usually
what
i
get
in
smoked
beers
o
this
beer
has
pretty
good
drinkability
it
has
a
nice
flavor
and
goes
down
easy
i
think
this
would
be
a
nice
beer
to
have
while
sitting
outside
on
a
hot
day
overall
i
enjoyed
it
and
i
would
pick
it
up
again
overall
very
good
easy
drinking
but
still
with
enough
unique
points
of
interest
to
make
me
want
another
some
time
o
very
quaffable
brew
tdespite
lack
of
a
smokey
scent
it
it
has
a
smokey
taste
crisp
and
refreshing
kind
of
a
mix
between
bitberger
and
schlenkerla
smokey
o
a
fantastic
lagerbier
the
smoke
is
definitely
toned
down
from
the
regular
marzen
but
this
is
just
as
fantastic
in
its
own
right
a
definite
pick
up
a
nice
light
beer
but
i
was
expecting
more
more
taste
more
smoke
something
to
make
the
taste
different
from
a
pilsner
overall
not
bad
but
i
prefer
this
breweries
other
offerings
owouldve
preferred
this
to
be
smokier
but
its
a
well
made
beer
on
the
whole
this
beer
packs
a
good
deal
of
smoky
flavor
and
is
wellbalanced
it
is
a
nice
and
pretty
drinkable
brew
pours
a
light
straw
color
with
a
thin
white
head
and
not
too
much
lacing
even
after
a
good
swirl
to
raise
the
head
back
up
the
nose
brings
a
good
amount
of
smoke
along
with
mild
lager
characteristics
lingering
in
the
background
the
smoke
definitely
overwhelms
the
lager
which
which
basically
just
means
a
lightlysmoked
carbonated
beverage
this
creates
problems
for
both
the
nose
and
the
taste
the
feel
is
redeemed
is
the
helles
crispness
is
still
there
and
fits
well
with
the
smoke
fairly
good
but
not
my
favorite
of
theirs
the
palate
like
the
nose
features
a
pleasantly
subdued
smoke
character
thats
very
complementary
to
the
crisp
breadiness
of
the
malt
light
in
body
quite
balanced
in
all
respects
and
very
clean
this
is
one
of
the
most
quaffable
beers
i
can
recall
having
in
recent
memory
the
mouthfeel
is
soft
and
theres
little
bitterness
or
bite
to
the
finish
but
its
a
thoroughly
enjoyable
and
flavorful
beer
especially
given
the
modest
abv
swirled
the
yeast
in
at
the
end
and
it
didnt
have
much
effect
it
blended
almost
imperceptibly
with
what
was
there
before
though
it
did
help
the
head
stand
up
quite
a
bit
better
this
is
the
perfect
way
to
introduce
people
to
smoked
beer
without
scaring
them
its
also
the
perfect
beer
for
a
summer
bbq
smoke
flavor
is
great
for
food
pairing
and
the
beer
is
still
mild
enough
to
provide
refreshment
drinkability
very
interesting
style
id
like
it
on
occasion
perhaps
as
a
segue
to
getting
someone
to
try
a
rauchbier
overall
good
beer
overall
good
stuff
the
smoke
character
is
pleasant
and
an
interesting
addition
but
i
think
i
prefer
the
style
without
it
d
would
make
for
a
good
starter
into
the
rauchbier
style
d
im
a
bit
iffy
on
the
drinkability
of
this
beer
from
the
bottle
i
think
the
smokiness
could
become
fatiguing
after
a
while
its
just
not
as
good
as
fresh
draft
on
the
other
hand
it
does
go
down
nicely
and
its
easy
to
session
at
4
3
d
very
enjoyable
and
refreshing
lager
i
would
definitely
have
many
of
these
beers
this
is
a
very
light
smooth
beer
with
an
interesting
flavor
when
you
think
about
all
of
the
flavor
that
is
packed
into
this
4
3
abv
beer
it
becomes
apparent
that
this
is
an
awesome
session
beer
though
it
wont
knock
off
augustiner
as
my
fave
for
the
style
the
schlenkerla
is
still
an
excellent
helles
nice
easy
drinker
i
love
their
festenbier
and
this
can
hold
me
over
until
its
available
each
spring
dark
gold
in
color
with
a
thin
white
lace
carbonation
is
fairly
low
theres
a
lot
of
sediment
in
the
glass
aroma
is
light
smoke
with
no
malt
or
hop
aroma
noticeable
flavor
is
delicious
on
its
on
its
a
wellmade
helles
with
a
light
slightly
bready
malt
flavor
then
there
is
the
added
layer
of
smokiness
that
melds
perfectly
with
the
malt
flavor
the
smokiness
is
present
but
subdued
compared
to
other
rauchbiers
drinkability
is
fantastic
pours
a
clear
gold
color
one
inch
head
of
an
offwhite
color
great
retention
and
great
lacing
smells
of
sweet
malt
pale
malt
smoke
hint
of
citrus
hint
of
hops
hint
of
yeast
fits
the
style
of
a
munich
helles
lager
mouth
feel
is
smooth
and
clean
with
an
average
carbonation
level
tastes
of
slight
sweet
malt
slight
pale
malt
slight
metallic
only
initially
fades
very
quickly
slight
hops
hint
of
wheat
and
hint
of
yeast
overall
good
appearance
smell
mouth
feel
body
and
blend
d
this
is
a
helles
naturally
it
will
be
about
as
drinkable
as
can
be
that
being
said
it
is
also
the
most
drinkable
smoke
flavored
beer
i
have
ever
had
5
stars
really
an
unusual
beer
that
works
through
not
something
i
would
drink
pints
of
but
it
is
a
nicely
crafted
full
flavored
lager
nice
beer
and
an
interesting
helles
immenesely
flavourable
for
4
3
and
highly
recommended
drinkability
a
lack
of
too
much
sweetness
helps
here
this
is
a
nice
dry
lager
mouthfeel
is
good
and
flavor
is
good
so
im
going
to
go
out
on
a
limb
and
say
the
drinkability
is
good
too
easy
to
drink
and
a
unique
beer
for
the
style
glad
i
tried
it
nice
balance
with
the
smoked
malts
but
im
not
sure
its
a
great
helles
underlying
the
whole
affair
still
probably
the
best
entry
into
smoked
beers
for
the
uninitiated
i
poured
into
my
glass
to
two
fingers
of
white
head
it
is
a
clear
golden
yellow
the
aroma
is
sweet
bready
malt
with
a
hint
of
their
famous
smoke
the
taste
is
sweet
malt
and
crisp
there
is
a
slight
smoke
finish
this
is
an
easy
drinking
beer
and
the
smoke
just
makes
it
better
d
i
definitely
want
to
try
this
beer
again
because
its
subtle
smoky
flavor
is
rather
unique
and
makes
both
the
smell
and
taste
rather
interesting
you
would
never
expect
the
smoke
from
the
appearance
of
this
beer
overall
i
wasnt
expecting
a
whole
lot
after
getting
a
whiff
of
this
beer
but
the
complexity
added
in
the
flavor
profile
more
than
made
up
for
it
a
very
interesting
and
subtle
beer
thats
well
worth
a
shot
the
mouthfeel
is
a
standout
in
this
beer
with
a
gentle
carbonation
and
a
sweet
finish
overall
the
smoke
yeast
both
took
away
from
the
cleaness
of
the
lager
and
didnt
add
enough
of
a
twist
to
make
it
great
overall
a
very
unique
helles
lager
the
smokiness
adds
a
pleasant
touch
definitely
worth
a
try
at
least
once
i
would
gladly
drink
again
pours
out
a
hazy
golden
color
in
appearance
frothy
head
dissappears
fast
stagnant
particles
remain
the
aroma
is
of
slightly
sweet
smoke
the
flavor
is
very
roasty
caramel
with
a
slight
smoke
finish
a
quite
drinkable
brew
i
would
get
this
again
at
the
south
philly
tap
room
poured
a
cloudy
yellowstraw
with
two
fingers
of
white
head
and
good
retention
picked
up
smoke
in
the
nose
but
less
so
than
in
some
of
the
other
schlenkerla
styles
tasted
very
smokey
initially
then
more
malty
and
then
a
nice
hoppymalty
finish
with
smokemalt
in
the
aftertaste
nicely
carbonated
mediumthin
feel
very
sessionable
d
this
is
definitely
not
the
norm
for
a
helles
lager
but
if
this
is
what
they
all
tasted
like
i
would
be
drinking
them
alot
more
often
great
flavor
and
aroma
the
smoked
malts
add
a
unique
twist
to
the
flavor
while
not
being
overpowering
full
flavor
without
being
too
heavy
and
retaining
that
crisp
lager
mouthfeel
i
didnt
get
to
watch
the
pour
but
it
was
served
to
me
in
a
weizen
glass
nice
golden
straw
colored
body
with
lots
of
carbonation
contributing
to
the
twofinger
offwhite
foamy
head
my
nose
is
picking
up
smoke
only
its
more
than
the
predominant
smell
here
the
taste
is
a
different
story
contrary
to
what
i
remember
about
the
marzen
the
smokiness
sits
back
a
little
and
though
while
ever
present
lets
the
malts
do
more
talking
theres
a
fine
carbonation
to
this
beer
with
medium
body
its
excellent
i
wish
i
werent
on
a
budget
because
id
order
another
i
enjoyed
this
beer
with
snails
and
venison
i
had
this
both
from
bottle
and
on
tap
and
it
s
always
superb
if
you
get
a
chance
a
definite
must
d
a
great
beer
for
grilling
this
is
a
nice
slightly
smokey
lager
d
very
enjoyable
i
prefer
this
to
most
lagers
very
dry
but
it
does
coat
the
tongue
a
bit
overall
a
really
interesting
mix
of
flavors
that
imho
comes
out
just
right
soft
carbonation
could
be
slightly
higher
but
there
is
little
to
quibble
with
here
nice
balance
of
sweetbitterdry
without
high
alcohol
makes
this
extremely
drinkable
even
many
of
those
who
try
to
avoid
the
harshness
of
some
smoked
beers
need
to
give
this
a
try
o
a
refreshing
and
light
beer
with
plenty
of
flavor
to
keep
you
wanting
more
id
like
a
little
more
hops
on
the
finish
but
you
can
definitely
drink
a
couple
of
these
without
blinking
slightly
sour
from
the
skunkiness
mostly
malty
with
a
mild
hop
spot
in
the
swallow
creamy
finish
good
body
for
the
style
not
the
best
light
malted
lager
but
it
holds
its
own
d
a
pretty
drinkable
brew
i
thought
this
was
a
smoked
beer
but
from
what
i
understand
it
is
not
at
almost
5
for
the
bottle
i
probably
wont
buy
again
a
fine
bavarian
lager
to
usher
in
the
spring
and
its
warming
weather
a
really
delightful
beer
this
would
be
a
good
brew
for
those
who
are
put
off
by
a
rauchbier
many
seem
to
be
but
are
intrigued
by
the
idea
of
a
smoked
beer
lately
ive
been
all
about
lagers
but
this
one
just
doesnt
do
it
for
me
theres
nothing
wrong
with
it
but
at
the
same
time
i
cant
pick
out
anything
about
it
that
i
love
beautiful
intriguing
beer
mediumbodied
decent
amount
of
carbonation
im
glad
this
one
wasnt
too
carbonated
as
it
would
have
overpowered
the
woody
smokey
flavor
very
much
a
session
beer
at
4
3
and
the
woody
flavor
in
conjunction
with
its
solid
munich
helles
lager
attributes
make
this
one
a
pleasure
to
consume
in
scalable
quantities
d
i
love
the
complexity
of
the
lager
and
the
smoke
compliments
in
every
way
and
really
addss
to
the
helles
excellent
drinkability
prosit
taste
is
of
corn
malt
a
little
sweet
in
back
a
little
smoke
and
well
hidden
hops
ends
dry
and
a
little
bitter
d
would
make
a
great
session
beer
if
it
was
significantly
cheaper
i
was
ecstatic
when
i
saw
this
at
the
store
im
really
glad
it
lived
up
to
my
expectations
poured
a
500ml
bottle
in
pint
glass
at
room
temp
clear
pilsenergolden
beer
with
a
small
white
head
faint
smoked
aromas
and
some
sweet
malt
in
the
flavour
good
smokey
notes
that
are
very
exciting
fresh
and
easy
to
drink
great
pilsner
beer
and
great
flavor
pours
a
light
golden
color
with
hardly
any
foam
at
all
it
looks
pretty
boring
really
smell
is
ok
some
light
hops
and
sweet
malt
flavor
are
pretty
prevalent
taste
is
pretty
similar
has
a
nice
sweet
malt
flavor
as
its
base
with
a
light
hop
flavor
to
it
mouthfeel
and
drinkability
are
decent
its
a
nice
helles
but
i
really
think
there
are
betters
out
d
a
very
drinkable
brew
a
nice
session
beer
w
lots
of
flavor
drinkability
is
great
a
beer
only
4
3
and
this
flavorful
forget
about
it
d
smooth
and
drinkable
at
this
low
abv
it
goes
down
easy
overall
this
is
a
great
helles
lager
very
nice
a
helles
for
smoked
salmon
lovers
poured
into
a
weisse
glass
has
a
big
beautiful
white
head
and
clear
very
light
straw
color
great
lacing
nice
clean
yeasty
aroma
and
a
great
light
but
flavorful
taste
i
enjoyed
this
alot
was
not
expecting
to
like
it
as
much
as
i
did
i
could
drink
this
all
day
if
it
was
not
so
expensive
a
wonderful
helles
style
brew
overall
the
beer
was
smooth
and
kind
fo
bland
the
smokey
aftertaste
was
unnecessary
and
abbreviated
my
pleasure
of
this
beer
sorry
schlenkerla
not
interested
di
would
drink
this
all
the
time
if
it
came
in
12
packs
the
price
is
kind
of
high
too
for
a
16
ounce
but
i
will
get
this
again
the
taste
is
quite
smooth
slightly
lemony
with
that
undefined
fruitiness
emerging
in
the
taste
as
well
the
real
definitive
element
in
the
beer
is
the
smoked
flavors
this
is
really
good
a
smoked
lager
thats
a
first
the
beer
is
very
light
moderately
refreshing
with
just
a
touch
of
dry
tartness
in
the
aftertaste
the
mouthfeel
is
pretty
undefined
and
light
this
is
a
must
try
for
its
uniqueness
lchaim
drinkability
this
is
a
very
refreshing
and
nicely
drinkable
beer
that
i
enjoyed
a
great
deal
i
could
easily
have
several
in
an
evening
and
i
wont
hesitate
to
have
this
one
again
and
i
certainly
will
look
for
it
in
the
future
even
thought
the
malts
in
this
one
are
not
smoked
it
is
amazing
just
how
much
smoke
this
beer
picks
up
just
from
being
brewed
in
the
same
brewery
on
the
same
equipment
this
smoky
character
definitely
sets
it
apart
from
the
field
of
helles
lagers
and
does
so
in
a
good
way
to
my
tastes
d
great
would
really
love
to
try
this
with
some
smoked
seafood
like
smoked
fish
muscles
cheeses
a
nice
treat
bright
clean
light
golden
body
with
a
big
fluffy
frothy
offwhite
head
biscuity
malt
aroma
with
light
touches
of
honey
and
grain
big
funky
euro
wall
of
hops
light
smokiness
slightly
soapy
toasted
biscuit
malt
up
front
snappy
eurohop
bitterness
provides
some
nice
funk
and
herbal
goodness
subtle
smokiness
beneath
it
all
lends
that
schlenkerla
signature
i
wouldnt
mind
more
smoke
though
light
honey
sweetness
lingers
in
the
finish
moderate
body
with
a
crisp
lively
mouthfeel
a
nice
session
lager
with
a
hint
of
smoke
makes
for
a
good
beer
overall
wasnt
too
impressed
with
the
corn
smell
but
drank
easy
with
a
crisp
smokiness
poured
a
golden
color
with
a
foamy
white
head
dissipating
to
a
thin
cap
and
lasting
lacing
smells
of
smoke
with
some
hops
tastes
of
smoke
malt
and
hops
in
a
nice
combination
mouthfeel
is
creamy
smoth
and
carbonated
drinkability
is
great
i
could
drink
these
all
night
although
i
like
the
smoked
ham
on
wheat
taste
of
their
original
schlenkerla
smokebeer
wheat
a
little
better
this
has
a
nice
clean
finish
that
would
be
easy
to
drink
in
quantity
d
a
good
beer
probably
the
closest
ive
come
to
being
wowed
by
a
helles
smoke
was
much
less
than
i
was
expecting
i
think
this
would
be
overwhelmed
by
ribs
but
something
like
pulled
chicken
could
make
a
pretty
good
pairing
i
would
drink
this
again
interesting
find
on
tap
at
the
other
side
cafe
in
boston
pours
pale
golden
with
offwhite
head
aroma
has
some
fruit
and
a
perfumy
quality
along
with
smoke
on
the
palate
the
perfume
quality
is
present
and
the
beer
is
overall
very
crisp
and
refreshing
good
accompaniment
to
the
pub
fare
d
i
really
dont
remember
this
much
smoke
when
i
had
it
on
tap
but
it
is
still
a
refreshing
interesting
beer
overall
a
very
nice
smoked
lager
quite
tasty
and
very
accurate
to
the
style
excellent
served
in
a
standard
pint
poured
a
bright
translucent
yellow
with
a
half
inch
foamy
bright
white
head
that
eventually
dissipates
into
a
solid
skim
some
strands
of
delicate
lacing
exposed
during
the
session
nose
was
very
mild
some
cereal
grains
taste
not
at
all
consistent
with
nose
smokey
jerky
some
sweetness
at
the
back
corn
syrup
reminds
me
of
a
rauchbier
mouthfeel
is
light
bodied
with
a
consistent
background
carbonation
from
sip
to
swallow
drinkability
is
decent
not
what
i
expected
good
complexity
but
not
as
refreshing
as
i
anticipated
and
with
that
said
unless
you
go
to
bamberg
to
sample
the
wares
theres
not
a
lot
of
other
examples
to
try
in
the
u
s
the
pour
is
light
yellow
with
brilliant
clarity
the
thin
white
head
doesnt
hang
around
too
long
receding
to
a
ring
on
the
nose
theres
a
light
smoky
character
with
a
touch
of
butter
and
a
crisp
biscuitcracker
character
clean
on
the
palate
it
opens
crisp
and
mildly
bitter
with
a
firm
earthy
hop
bite
and
a
touch
of
lemon
mild
smoky
character
woody
in
nature
dry
and
bitter
on
the
finish
the
bodys
light
and
the
crisp
refreshing
finish
and
great
carbonation
make
for
a
truly
drinkable
beer
pours
a
clear
yellow
color
with
one
inch
of
white
head
that
had
good
retention
the
head
eventually
settles
to
a
thin
cap
moderate
amount
of
lacin
is
left
on
the
glass
i
can
smell
some
sweet
malt
with
noticable
noble
hops
a
touch
of
smoke
is
also
detected
a
different
flavor
than
the
typical
helles
a
little
smoke
up
front
before
the
sweet
malt
takes
over
the
hops
are
a
little
weak
but
noticable
in
the
finish
cereal
grains
in
the
aftertaste
bitterness
is
low
light
body
with
abundant
carbonation
that
stops
short
of
being
harsh
low
abv
and
the
unusual
flavor
component
makes
this
one
an
interesting
drinker
mouthfeel
and
drinkability
are
spot
on
thanks
d
this
beer
is
the
definition
of
a
session
beer
for
me
very
tasty
and
extremely
drinkable
this
was
a
lovely
surprise
this
beer
is
just
packed
with
flavor
but
it
isnt
a
big
bulky
brew
just
light
and
flavorful
they
ave
succeed
in
creating
a
whopper
of
a
low
abv
beer
that
i
would
stack
up
against
many
big
beers
if
you
want
a
reprieve
from
your
everyday
bavarian
helles
this
is
the
way
to
go
the
body
is
light
and
crisp
it
flows
nicely
across
the
tongue
the
only
reason
drinkability
suffers
is
that
the
smoke
gets
tiresome
i
could
have
1
a
day
but
probably
not
2
overall
a
very
good
beer
try
it
when
you
get
the
chance
done
or
two
of
these
would
be
all
id
need
mainly
because
the
smoke
becomes
the
dominating
flavor
after
a
while
it
would
seem
like
a
good
easy
beer
on
a
hot
summer
day
d
tasty
goes
down
very
easily
not
filling
at
all
mild
kick
very
good
representation
of
style
this
is
a
really
nice
simple
beer
that
is
worth
drinking
for
a
long
time
drinkability
is
good
the
smoke
is
pretty
subtle
allowing
the
munich
helles
part
of
the
beer
to
show
well
but
the
smoke
ends
up
a
bit
too
light
to
be
fully
appreciated
the
overall
chracter
is
quite
nice
but
ends
up
a
bit
less
than
it
could
be
still
a
solid
beer
on
tap
pours
a
brilliantly
clear
pale
gold
in
color
with
about
a
finger
of
white
head
that
quickly
settles
to
just
a
thin
cap
aroma
is
quite
nice
slightly
grainy
but
generally
clean
pils
malt
and
a
low
slightly
spicy
noble
hop
aroma
taste
is
pretty
darn
good
as
well
a
bit
grainy
at
first
but
that
gives
way
to
a
good
pilmalt
character
a
lowmedium
hop
bitterness
with
low
noble
hop
flavor
good
mouthfeel
with
mediumlight
body
and
medium
carbonation
drinkability
is
quite
good
this
is
a
great
example
of
a
helles
lager
its
perfect
for
a
warm
summers
day
and
was
very
enjoyable
drinkability
this
is
the
least
smoky
of
the
scherlenkerla
offerings
and
only
has
a
touch
of
smoke
on
the
aftertaste
a
decent
lager
i
could
have
two
but
would
no
desire
for
a
third
overall
a
nice
mellow
quaffable
lager
which
doesnt
overdo
the
smokiness
recommended
a
decent
example
of
the
style
from
the
land
that
bore
it
i
cant
say
that
its
the
best
ive
had
but
it
has
more
hop
character
than
some
other
examples
ive
had
decent
very
drinkable
if
you
like
smoke
but
it
has
the
drinkability
of
a
helles
and
the
right
amount
of
smoke
only
increases
its
drinkability
very
smooth
with
tiny
trace
of
astringency
crisp
sometimes
creamy
carbonation
an
interesting
helles
lager
indeed
it
is
nowhere
near
the
smoke
character
of
their
other
beers
but
it
is
there
in
a
subtle
way
which
makes
it
slightly
more
complex
if
it
were
cheaper
i
would
gladly
drink
again
mfd
a
cool
refreshing
beer
that
actually
has
some
body
and
meaning
to
it
the
carbonation
is
sizable
and
makes
up
much
of
the
caracter
along
with
the
smoke
this
beer
pours
a
clear
bright
golden
yellow
with
a
thin
but
substantial
white
head
that
leave
wispy
lacing
behind
the
nose
is
dominated
by
smoke
but
not
quite
like
a
marzen
slightly
more
muted
but
still
highly
present
pale
malts
can
be
detected
in
the
nose
as
well
taste
is
a
surprise
as
the
smokey
flavoring
is
more
of
an
after
thought
taste
is
heavier
on
biscuity
malts
too
biscuity
smokiness
is
in
the
finish
this
was
a
lighter
bodied
beer
decent
carbonation
not
filling
at
all
the
taste
lessens
the
drinkability
on
this
beer
i
was
really
disappointed
with
the
overbiscuity
smoked
flavor
it
wasnt
well
balanced
for
me
taste
is
smokey
with
bready
malt
the
smoked
malt
is
adding
a
subtle
smoke
flavour
without
any
bandaids
or
rubbery
notes
this
is
quite
unique
the
smoke
reminds
me
most
of
a
fresh
timber
fire
crisping
wood
there
are
some
biscuity
and
ambermalty
notes
that
contributet
to
the
body
of
the
beer
the
smoke
makes
this
beer
a
really
unique
lager
beer
which
i
wouldnt
drink
all
night
but
a
couple
a
night
will
do
had
this
on
tap
at
the
el
bait
shop
in
des
moines
poured
a
nice
golden
lager
color
i
am
not
a
big
fan
of
smoked
beer
so
i
was
surprised
to
find
that
the
smkoked
aroma
was
very
subtle
mostly
biscuity
aroma
same
in
the
taste
with
hints
of
caramel
the
smokey
taste
always
lingers
all
the
way
to
the
end
i
rather
enjoyed
this
beer
the
smokiness
didnt
overpower
the
beer
good
beer
a
halfliter
bottle
poured
into
my
great
lakes
dimpled
mug
appears
a
clear
golden
straw
color
with
about
two
fingers
of
pillowy
bone
white
foam
no
lacing
to
speak
of
a
great
looking
pour
nose
and
flavor
are
of
a
rather
mild
smokiness
obviously
the
least
smoked
of
all
the
schlenkerlas
and
it
really
works
here
the
beer
picks
up
a
very
subtle
smokiness
from
the
wood
tanks
notes
of
lightly
toasted
bread
and
malts
as
well
as
grassy
hops
are
also
noticeable
medium
bodied
and
a
bit
oily
with
ample
carbonation
the
perfect
beer
to
introduce
you
to
the
schlenkerla
line
pour
is
golden
with
a
nice
head
white
tight
and
some
lace
the
nose
is
a
bit
of
apple
but
predominately
smokiness
not
overpowering
though
some
honey
some
fruit
the
palate
isnt
as
dry
but
not
earth
but
smoke
very
mild
earth
very
light
actually
all
around
would
like
to
see
more
malt
character
equivalent
with
the
smoke
a
stylistically
particular
beer
as
a
helles
so
not
a
beer
for
the
regular
lager
man
would
recommend
with
rips
though
smoke
smell
silky
smooth
taste
and
feel
and
drinkability
are
awesome
ii
cant
imagine
how
to
improve
this
but
its
possible
it
may
happen
really
great
beer
i
wish
i
could
afford
to
stock
my
fridge
with
this
stuff
for
the
summer
looks
like
something
im
not
going
to
like
im
a
fan
of
the
aecht
smoke
beers
and
bought
this
on
a
lark
clear
golden
lager
pour
with
a
short
lived
white
head
not
much
at
all
in
the
smell
nothing
offensive
nothing
delicious
just
clean
taste
is
similar
a
bit
bready
nothing
as
forward
as
a
witte
or
a
weizen
nice
carbonation
and
a
solid
mouthfeel
drinkability
is
a
no
brainer
this
is
lawn
mower
beer
a
great
summer
beverage
cold
crisp
and
clean
thoroughly
enjoyable
altogether
this
is
some
good
clean
fun
a
light
beer
with
lovely
flavor
i
suggest
rauch
fans
try
it
to
taste
a
less
forceful
employment
of
this
versatile
malt
i
could
see
this
level
of
smoke
in
plenty
of
beers
would
be
nice
in
a
simcoe
ipa
or
apa
for
sure
overall
i
do
not
recommend
this
one
i
would
try
it
again
from
the
bottle
but
i
am
not
looking
forward
to
it
very
drinkable
a
great
example
of
this
style
of
beer
overall
a
stellar
beer
and
should
be
the
standard
by
which
all
others
in
this
style
are
judged
just
by
the
malt
hop
profile
alone
the
smokiness
is
an
added
bonus
ive
yet
to
be
disappointed
by
any
bamberg
breweries
offerings
now
if
i
could
just
get
mahrs
brewing
closer
to
my
area
pours
a
clear
golden
yellow
color
with
a
medium
sized
white
head
that
leaves
some
soapy
sticking
corn
flakey
fresh
grain
quality
rich
sweet
malt
lemon
skin
and
a
little
bit
of
metal
in
the
nose
crisp
in
flavor
great
balance
achieved
here
i
love
the
earthy
herbal
hop
character
superb
water
quality
excellent
malt
choice
with
the
subtlest
hints
of
smokiness
a
larger
than
light
body
with
perfect
carbonation
the
only
flaw
i
catch
is
the
semisticky
malt
flavor
lingers
and
coats
a
little
too
much
on
the
mouth
and
leaves
what
to
me
tastes
like
a
coppermetal
flavor
on
the
tongue
either
way
this
is
a
light
flavorful
sessionable
german
helles
lager
a
nice
overall
beer
one
i
would
recommend
as
a
departure
from
the
american
lagers
lightbodied
wellcarbonated
completely
inoffensive
and
quaffable
notes
loved
it
and
the
brauerei
hellertrum
schlenkerla
again
demonstrates
their
mastery
of
the
styles
that
they
brew
highly
recommended
purchased
at
whole
foods
market
nyc
poured
into
a
pilsner
glass
golden
yellow
nice
solid
head
which
dissapates
rather
quickly
good
lacing
and
lasting
carbonation
have
to
agree
with
previous
reviewers
in
the
doughy
odor
to
it
heavy
malt
taste
initially
mouthfeel
is
unremarkable
finishes
with
a
smoked
flavor
slightly
bitter
not
bad
a
fairly
drinkable
beer
would
probably
make
an
excellent
acoompanying
beer
for
brats
or
smoked
sausages
serving
type
bottle
pours
a
hazy
golden
straw
color
with
a
small
pure
white
head
the
aroma
is
of
a
breadydoughy
malt
and
a
nice
spicy
hop
the
taste
is
of
the
doughy
munich
malt
and
spicy
nobel
hops
more
of
a
hop
profile
than
your
typical
munich
helles
there
is
also
a
tin
like
flavor
as
well
the
feel
is
moderate
nice
malty
chewiness
fizzy
carbonation
finishes
sweet
and
spicy
an
easy
drinking
brew
the
spicy
hops
neutralize
the
munich
malt
so
this
brew
doesnt
have
the
typical
munich
helles
flavor
worth
a
go
d
i
didnt
know
what
to
expect
but
i
was
pleasantly
surprised
with
my
findings
a
great
brew
at
a
reasonable
price
will
have

drinkability
as
i
generally
dont
care
for
the
style
it
is
hard
to
get
excited
about
this
it
does
drink
nicely
however
and
the
smoke
adds
an
interesting
dimension
pours
a
very
pale
golden
yellow
color
with
a
lot
of
visible
carbonation
and
a
thin
white
head
aroma
is
dominated
by
a
smokey
woodsy
maltiness
with
very
slight
golden
fuit
notes
golden
pilsner
altiness
with
a
subtle
hop
character
and
a
very
smokey
characoal
wood
chip
flavor
dry
finish
as
helles
lagers
go
this
was
was
soso
the
lager
character
was
there
with
noticeable
honey
and
lemon
somewhat
mellowed
by
a
light
smoke
flavor
but
really
the
smoke
was
so
distant
as
to
be
difficult
to
detect
so
in
the
end
the
smokiness
was
not
a
factor
in
either
aroma
or
taste
that
leaves
the
helles
part
and
id
say
that
was
pretty
distant
too
when
compared
to
something
like
a
weihenstephan
helles
the
schlenkerla
was
dull
yellow
in
color
with
a
thin
body
light
carbonation
and
a
bite
that
was
rather
toothless
i
love
schlenkerlas
rauchbiers
but
this
particular
beer
could
be
a
pass
pours
a
straw
golden
color
with
medium
white
head
and
some
spots
of
lacing
down
the
glass
smell
is
just
excellent
more
of
a
smoked
presence
than
from
the
bottle
thats
for
sure
it
is
just
as
prominent
as
anything
else
in
the
nose
taste
carries
on
in
that
fashion
for
such
a
light
brew
there
is
a
lot
going
on
biscuity
cereal
like
malt
faint
fruit
and
earthy
grassy
hops
a
touch
of
honey
nice
light
mouth
with
a
crisp
snap
in
the
finish
just
an
all
around
excellent
and
memorable
beer
one
of
my
favorites
of
any
style
d
this
beer
is
pretty
much
awesome
all
around
and
i
would
have
no
problem
spending
a
day
drinking
nothing
but
this
outstanding
d
a
no
brainer
as
far
as
a
beer
that
i
would
like
to
have
a
couple
of
i
will
seek
out
again
i
look
forward
to
drinking
this
again
notes
from
9206
good
cigar
brew
this
was
my
first
helles
lager
and
i
like
the
style
very
light
and
crisp
well
worth
trying
d
after
the
initial
shock
of
experiencing
this
unique
taste
i
found
this
beer
to
be
thoroughly
delicious
as
well
as
refreshing
on
this
presidential
election
morning
and
most
interesting
breakfast
ive
had
in
a
long
while
they
say
it
only
picks
up
smoke
flavor
from
being
brewed
in
the
same
vessels
as
the
rauchbiers
no
doubt
that
fact
characterizes
its
friendly
drinkable
nature
i
heard
someone
say
bbq
drinkability
well
that
really
was
a
breath
of
fresh
air
schlenkerla
lite
i
dare
say
overall
highly
drinkable
and
a
very
good
way
to
casually
introduce
yourself
to
schlenkerlas
wares
not
the
best
light
beer
ive
had
and
not
my
favorite
beer
from
schlenkerla
it
you
like
crispy
pale
lagers
with
a
touch
of
smoke
added
to
it
then
i
could
see
this
as
some
kind
of
session
beer
for
me
one
of
these
was
good
enough
d
this
beer
has
a
great
balance
of
light
smoke
noble
hops
and
yeasty
malt
notes
i
never
though
smoke
in
a
helles
would
work
but
this
beer
really
has
all
the
flavors
working
together
d
the
best
helles
ive
had
though
its
obvious
this
has
some
rauchbier
tendencies
not
really
sure
how
to
classify
this
guy
all
in
all
a
very
good
brew
with
much
more
character
than
the
average
helles
overall
i
would
have
to
give
this
one
an
average
definitly
not
the
best
thing
i
have
ever
had
by
a
long
shot
but
nowhere
near
the
worst
i
would
try
it
again
if
nothing
else
were
around
but
not
at
the
2
99
i
paid
for
it
mfd
needless
to
say
this
was
not
my
cup
of
tea
or
beer
in
this
case
i
guess
its
a
good
representation
of
the
schlenkerla
style
but
being
a
hells
lager
i
didnt
expect
such
a
smokey
smelltaste
poured
a
slightly
hazy
pale
yellow
there
was
a
very
slight
head
that
quickly
dissipated
and
no
lace
theres
nothing
on
the
label
except
the
name
that
indicates
the
smokey
quality
of
the
beer
and
id
forgotten
that
about
the
name
not
bad
though
balanced
considering
the
smoke
of
course
a
smokey
finish
slight
smoke
in
the
nose
be
fun
to
cook
with
d
remarkably
drinkable
this
came
very
close
to
a
5
for
me
light
sessionable
abv
only
4

nice
aroma
intriguing
flavor
one
ill
definitely
seek
out
again
d
awesome
beer
would
love
to
have
a
keg
of
this
at
home
tons
of
flavor
without
the
hammer
d
can
drink
them
all
afternoon
surprising
whiff
of
a
light
smoked
peat
crisp
with
some
lingering
summer
spices
yep
the
dash
of
smoke
moves
into
the
quaff
gingerly
and
nicely
a
very
nice
treat
that
drinks
easily
in
the
summer
heat
a
good
session
brew
with
the
4
3
and
only
a
bit
over
3
for
a
500ml
bottle
very
nice
on
the
palate
with
a
pretty
god
feel
and
a
nice
tingle
of
carbonation
nice
balance
of
the
hops
made
this
a
pretty
pleasing
beer
drinkability
great
example
of
the
style
getting
better
and
better
as
it
warms
so
easily
drinkable
it
would
make
a
great
paring
with
any
kind
of
smoked
food
drinkability
this
was
quite
an
interesting
beer
im
usually
not
a
lager
fan
but
this
one
was
pretty
intriguing
the
smokiness
added
a
lot
to
the
beer
more
complex
than
your
normal
lager
i
could
see
drinking
this
with
some
bbq
on
a
summer
day
d
again
could
have
scored
higher
if
it
were
not
for
that
soapy
kind
of
taste
near
the
end
this
beer
is
quite
refreshing
for
a
slightly
smoked
beer
and
the
mouthfeel
will
always
bring
me
back
for
more
had
this
at
chef
pauls
served
in
its
own
glassware
and
i
couldnt
stop
drinking
it
appearance
is
your
typical
helles
lager
very
light
straw
in
color
with
perfect
clarity
and
a
nice
creamy
white
head
and
lacing
that
coats
throughout
aroma
is
nicesome
sweet
doughybready
malts
light
grassy
and
spicy
hops
and
just
a
hint
of
light
smoke
providing
an
interesting
twist
taste
is
nicely
balanced
with
the
sweet
malts
finishing
clean
with
a
light
smooth
bitterness
creamy
frothy
mouthfeel
that
feels
a
bit
bigger
than
its
abv
would
suggest
very
drinkable
and
a
really
nice
session
beerinteresting
and
with
a
low
abv
i
recommend
this
beer
strongly
to
any
lover
of
helles
lagers
or
rauchbiers
its
not
a
true
rauchbier
of
course
but
has
just
enough
to
satisfy
for
this
style
pours
very
pale
gold
with
a
frothy
white
head
aroma
of
yeast
smoke
and
spice
light
highly
carbonated
body
initial
taste
is
crisp
and
clean
pilsner
like
hops
lagerlike
finish
is
nicely
and
not
overwhlelmingly
smoked
which
definitely
elevates
this
otherwise
unexciting
beer
not
my
favorite
of
the
aecht
schlenkerla
line
but
a
clean
crisp
refreshing
beer
drinkability
is
slightly
above
average
at
4
30
you
can
put
away
a
bunch
of
these
but
the
novelty
of
the
smoke
gets
a
little
old
also
a
little
nagging
since
theyre
not
going
all
out
like
a
rauchbier
pours
very
pale
golden
like
straw
with
very
little
head
i
was
motivated
to
try
this
beer
by
recent
threads
on
ba
about
how
this
beer
had
picked
up
some
of
the
smoke
characteristics
from
being
made
in
the
same
brewery
as
the
rauchbiers
though
merely
incidental
contact
with
the
smoke
sure
enough
there
is
indeed
smoke
in
the
nose
and
taste
it
is
relatively
subtle
but
definitely
there
and
part
of
the
overall
flavor
profile
beside
that
the
beer
is
a
light
but
pleasant
helles
with
moderate
bitterness
and
is
quite
clean
and
a
bit
of
a
sweet
light
malt
tang
smooth
and
crisp
and
the
smoke
really
blends
beautifully
in
this
case
you
get
less
of
the
smoked
meat
and
more
subtle

alder
scent
nice
this
was
on
tap
at
the
moan
and
dove
settled
with
a
clear
gold
appearance
and
an
excellent
frosty
head
that
thinned
out
the
smells
were
rich
in
grassy
and
toasty
hops
while
in
the
flavor
category
it
had
a
sourbitter
citrus
balance
going
on
wrapped
around
the
grainy
and
dry
toasty
texture
in
the
mouthfeel
department
the
beer
was
light
and
smooth
probably
thanks
to
the
smokiness
overall
pretty
good
this
is
very
drinkable
feels
light
medium
carbonation
gives
a
prickly
mouthfeel

a
dull

a

a
very
thin
wispy

i
picked
up
faint
smoke
and
toasted

with
light
ironmineral
taste
is
sweeter
than
expected
some
defienent
honey
malt
and
a
touch
of
spice
with
the
smoke
coming
thru
but
not
overbearing
not
much
hop
presence
a
light
to
medium
mouthfeel
and
a
low
abv
makes
it
very
drinkable
but
its
a
little
dull
on
the
palate
and
a
little
sweeter
than
expected
d
good
summer
drinker
and
not
overpowering
on
the
smoke
but
was
hoping
for
a
bit
more
of
that
bacon
background
ive
come
to
love
from
as
beers
good
drinkability
easy
but
keeps
yuou
interested
this
one
provides
a
unique
take
on
a
helles
the
light
sweet
maltiness
smoke
and
hops
create
a
nice
range
of
flavors
this
beer
pours
a
clear
golden
color
the
head
is
one
inch
in
height
frothy
and
recedes
slowly
into
nice
lacing
the
aroma
is
of
biscuity
malt
with
a
soft
spicy
hop
presence
the
taste
is
like
the
aroma
but
with
a
very
slight
hint
of
smoke
the
mouthfeel
is
lightmedium
bodied
with
lively
carbonation
overall
this
is
a
great
helles
i
will
certainly
drink
this
again
otherwise
a
decent
stab
at
the
style
this
beer
is
crystal
clear
and
golden
in
the
glass
with
a
nice
fluffy
cap
of
white
foam
pale
malts
and
graininess
emanate
into
the
nose
perhaps
a
slight
smokiness
as
well
the
beer
is
light
to
medium
bodied
the
taste
is
similar
to
the
aroma
with
bready
malts
and
very
little
indication
of
bitterness
or
hops
the
finish
has
a
very
slight
hint
of
smoke
subtlety
is
key
here
and
that
should
be
appreciated
drinkability
complex
taste
but
still
nicely
drinkable
d
drinkability
is
very
good
especially
within
style
m
light
in
body
refreshing
crispness
and
spot
on
carbonation
make
this
a
very
drinkable
offering
also
highly
sessionable
this
is
a
crystal
clear
clean
golden
lager
with
a
white
head
you
can
see
why
its
a
helles
theres
a
good
sweet
malt
aroma
and
cleansing
mouthfeel
this
beer
has
an
amazing
interplay
of
malt
smoke
and
hops
you
start
out
with
a
light
smoke
that
returns
in
the
aftertaste
with
an
amazing
dance
of
smoke
and
hopppy
bitternes
that
inataly
clenses
but
after
half
the
glass
just
keeps
going
i
wish
i
could
have
this
with
some
lightly
smoke
salmon
or
sushi
bottle
poured
clear
golden
yellow
color
lager
with
a
medium
white
foamy
head
with
average
retention
and
limited
lacing
aroma
of
floral
malt
with
some
sweetness
also
noticeable
taste
is
a
mix
between
some
floral
malt
with
some
sweet
notes
but
i
could
not
distinguish
any
some
at
all
body
is
quite
full
and
slightly
oily
with
some
medium
carbonation
interesting
but
not
really
smokey
pours
golden
and
extremely
clear
nice
white
two
finger
head
that
does
not
linger
nose
is
subtle
with
hints
of
yeast
spice
and
fruit
the
taste
is
bright
and
sharp
with
apple
and
pear
flavors
clean
spicy
finish
that
leaves
a
bit
of
a
funky
taste
on
the
roof
of
the
mouth
a
great
beer
for
a
hot
summer
day
or
a
cold
rainy
night
like
this
while
waiting
for
dinner
overall
pretty
good
but
a
little
on
the
boring
side
honestly
it
may
be
a
good
beer
to
introduce
new
advocates
into
the
world
of
smoke
seeing
as
how
it
is
much
more
tame
than
their
other
beers
its
definitely
worth
a
try
but
i
wouldnt
lose
any
sleep
searching
for
it
easy
to
drink
for
a
smoky
beer
still
if
i
wanted
a
smoky
beer
i
would
choose
something
else
from
this
brewery
this
is
pretty
much
a
runofthemill
munich
helles
lager
with
this
brewerys
rauchbier
characteristic
drinks
very
easy
i
was
really
impressed
at
how
low
the
abv
was
but
this
didnt
show
any
thinness
still
packed
flavor
one
i
could
easily
pound
through
a
football
doubleheader
or
drink
one
or
2
just
enjoy
its
subtleties
d
overall
an
insanely
drinkable
beer
with
only
4
3
abv
a
light
but
not
ultralight
body
and
enough
hops
to
keep
the
palate
interested
this
would
make
a
great
session
beer
fans
of
german
lagers
especially
the
helles
style
will
definitely
appreciate
this
one
very
well
done
highly
recommended
a
good
summer
beer
on
a
hot
day
when
foolish
people
open
their
cans
of
budweiser
swill
this
would
be
a
tasty
respectable
alternative
very
light
but
with
some
nice
smoky
flavor
perfect
for
late
summer
as
airy
taste
and
smell
fit
with
the
season
but
the
underlying
smoke
lingers
as
if
to
remind
the
palate
and
the
person
that
cool
autumn
will
soon
be
on
its
way
clear
straw
hued
body
has
a
small
and
fleeting
white
head
aroma
has
some
subtle
smokiness
but
mostly
sweetish
malt
and
spicy
hop
crisp
medium
body
supports
a
light
body
and
medium
carbonation
clean
feel
taste
has
some
sweet
gariny
malt
that
is
expertly
balanced
by
a
clean
spicy
hoppiness
the
smoked
malt
is
present
but
not
obtrusive
most
noticeable
as
an
aftertaste
very
sessionable
the
brewerys
most
accessible
smoked
bier
that
ive
sampled
this
one
doesnt
come
across
like
liquid
smoke
colored
golden
like
a
typical
lager
and
the
head
dissipates
quickly
the
smell
is
crisp
and
slightly
smoky
this
would
be
a
great
gateway
beer
into
rauchbier
like
the
schlenkerla
marzen
personally
i
think
the
smokiness
is
so
slight
that
it
teases
rather
than
fulfills
but
then
again
this
isnt
labeled
a
rauchbier
still
very
interesting
d
a
very
good
beer
good
nose
and
flavor
and
an
outstanding
mouthfeel
what
a
light
lager
can
taste
like

a
brown
half
liter
bottle
a
little
bit
of
malt
and
perhaps
a
bit
of
smoke
are
noticeable
in
the
nose
this
is
a
very
pleasant
tasting
lager
with
a
strong

of

that
is
more
noticeable
at
some
points
than
others
very
drinkable
prosit

d
during
the
first
several
sips
the
smokiness
is
overwhelming
however
as
you
sip
it
further
it
seems
to
start
to
blend
more
with
the
beer
that
said
this
is
my
first
beer
from
bamberg
the
inventors
of
smoke
beer
so
i
think
this
is
very
good
for
a
smoke
flavored
helles
not
something
i
would
normally
drink
but
i
think
this
would
be
a
great
beer
for
any
beer
geek
to
try
as
its
very
interesting

wine
wells
me
oddly
at
least
to
me
is
that
this
beer
really
does
look
lagerlike
it
is
golden
with
nice
amounts
of
head
aroma
is
very
smokey
mouthfeel
is
actually
fairly
pleasant
recommended
it
poured
like
your
average
euro
lager
fairly
clear
gold
with
a
thin
white
head
that
dissipated
quickly
it
smelled
of
light
toasted
grains
apple
and
grassy
hops
but
the
whole
thing
was
enhanced
by
the
smoky
schlenkerla
flavor
that
i
now
love
tastes
pretty
good
it
would
be
a
typical
decent
german
lager
but
for
the
hints
of
smoke
which
make
it
an
intriguing
take
on
the
helles
style
i
was
surprised
to
read
on
the
website
that
there
is
actually
no
smoked
malt
in
this
beer
but
its
fermented
in
the
same
vessels
in
which
they
make
their
marzenbiers
which
gives
it
that
smoky
infusion
yum
its
decently
crisp
and
for
an
extratasty

say
an

got
to
make
it
out

later

quite
possibly
the
best
german
lager
i
have
had
in
a
very
long
time
perhaps
ever
poured
up
very
average
looking
with
a
golden
straw
colour
and
snow
white
head
foamy
top
faded
away
in
about
45
seconds
smell
was
a
little
grassy
and
smelled
like
1000s
of
other
german
lagers
so
far
pretty
average
but
average
ends
here
taste
was
actually
a
bit
sweet
and
reminded
me
a
little
bit
of
honey
very
little
bit
but
honey
none
the
less
an
illusion
im
sure
as
i
see
no
mention
of
honey
anywhere
on
the
bottle
finish
was
mildly
bitter
drink
was
very
gentle
smooth
and
pleasant
all
the
way
through
mouthfeel
was
very
smooth
with
just
the
right
level
of
co2
a
very
impressive
lager
indeed
i
wish
i
had
a
case
at
4
3
i
think
this
is
a
fantastic
session
beer
i
raise
my
glass
to
taking
a
chance
on
a
label
ive
never
heard
or
read
about
before
what
a
home
run
the
schlenkerla
malty
flavor
and
smoke
combination
has
got
to
be
one
of
the
most
addicting
flavor
combinations
out
there
in
my
opinion
whenever
i
open
any
of
their
beers
its
tough
to
make
it
last
five
minutes
awesome
brew
although
no
mention
of
rauch
smoke
is
made
on
the
label
i
suppose
the
schenkerla
beers
are
a
product
of
a
bamberg
rauchbierbrauerei
thus
a
smoke
character
could
have
been
expected
as
with
the
other
schenkerla
beers
this
helles
was
quite
good
and
highly
recommended
if
you
enjoy
the
more
delicate
smoky
flavors
of
german
rauchmalz
prost

a
clear

liked
this
thought
the
smoke
character
was
perfect
and
gave
it
that
extra
complexity
great
change
during
this
tasting
thanks
harry
the
body
is
fairly
thin
as
expected
though
i
thought
it
would
be
a
little
more
crisp
a
little
more
cleaner
than
i
expected
as
well
given
the
smoke
good
overall
i
probably
wont
drink
it
again
but
at
least
it
has
helped
me
to
gain
a
little
more
appreciation
for
rauchbier
which
is
one
of
the
few
german
styles
i
have
yet
to
truly
adore
a
light
lager
that
is
pretty
bright
white
rocky
head
of
foam
with
spicy
hoppy
aroma
and
a
hint
of
smoke
a
very
nicely
balanced
helles
lager
so
light
in
fact
that
you
can
taste
the
minerals
sort
of
salty
with
a
bit
more
hop
bite
in
the
finish
than
expected
the
unusual
phenolics
from
smoke
im
told
add
a
funky
dimension
to
this
beer
that
i
can
enjoy
love
the
smoked
beers
and
this
one
is
pretty
darn
good
too
pours
an
apple
golden
head
would
form
somewhat
a
little
cloudy
aroma
of
a
peaty
cider
plenty
of
fireplace
like
peat
with
notes
of
apple
and
pear
the
smoke
takes
over
the
in
the
taste
department
setting
it
apart
from
other
munich
helles
giving
it
much
more
character
really
distinctive
peat
smoke
a
lot
of
ripe
apple
in
the
taste
a
bold
malt
bill
too
distinct
especially
within
its
style
and
quite
filling
drinks
heavier
than
a
standard
german
lager
happy
to
try
good
lager
and
great
fall
back
if
you
dont
know
what
you
want
but
prefer
something
that
is
highly
dirnkable
its
hard
not
to
like
this
beer
its
a
tasty
superdrinkable
lager
that
i
could
consume
all
day
long
ive
been
looking
for
this
offering
for
quite
some
time
now
and
im
glad
that
i
finally
found
a
bottle
its
a
great
addition
to
the
aecht
schlekerla
series
of
beers
and
is
easily
the
equal
of
my
other
favorites
of
the
munich
helles
lager
style
the
versions
from
brauereien
aying
and
weihenstephaner
helles
lagerbier
is
a
light
smoky
treat
and
should
be
on
the
must
try
list
of
all
who
consider
themselves
connoisseurs
of
smoked
beer
another
quality
brew
from
these
guys
perhaps
it
is
just
because
it
is
not
my
style
but
i
found
this
one
to
be
very
unimpressive
and
the
only
aecht
schlenkerla
i
will
not
buy
a
second
one
found
this
one
at
the
always
worth
a
visit

into

this
lagerbier
poured
a
clear
golden
color
with
white
foam
that
persisted
a
while
then
dissipated
almost
completely
though
clinging
a
bit
on
the
glass
there
was
a
good
stream
of
carbonation
from
the
bottom
of
the
glass
the
smell
was
lightly
malty
with
a
touch
of
sweetness
there
was
perhaps
the
faintest
touch
of
smoke
but
perhaps
it
was
my
imagination
the
taste
was
nicely
mildly
malty
with
a
slight
lager
tanginess
the
hoppiness
was
very
mild
but
well
balanced
with
the
malt
as
with
the
aroma
there
was
perhaps
the
faintest
touch
of
smoke
in
the
flavor
the
mouthfeel
was
smooth
with
medium
body
and
modest
carbonation
there
was
a
mildly
hoppy
finish
this
was
a
very
nice
mild
helles
lager
drinkability
a
little
better
than
average
would
have
given
it
more
but
the
bitterness
was
a
wee
bit
too
prominent
poured
into
an
imperial
pint
glass
formed
a
12
bright
white
head
over
the
clear
light
golden
brew
head
fades
down
relatively
quickly
to
white
film
with
prevalent
sticky
lace
aroma
is
light
sweetness
with
the
everpresent
schlenkerla
smokiness
although
a
bit
controlled
here
taste
is
excellently
balanced
with
the
maltiness
countered
by
the
moderate
hoppiness
and
wisps
of
smoke
throughout
it
all
mouthfeel
and
drinkability
are
excellent
this
ones
got
the
best
of
both
worlds
some
smokiness
but
still
easily
approachable
this
is
the
schlenkerla
to
start
someone
new
with
ya
know
the
thing
about
lagers
is
they
go
down
so
easily
and
one
this
good
is
hard
to
savor
tasty
with
just
enough
complexity
to
make
it
interesting
very
nicely
done
this
would
be
very
good
with
grilled
food
recommended
i
love
this
beer
i
had
this
for
the
first
time
at
a
tasting
with
my
beer
rep
at
the
bar
i
used
to
work
for
drinking
this
beer
made
me
nervous
at
first
seeing
as
rauchbier
is
a
once
in
a
while
indulgence
for
me
what
a
surprise
though
poured
into
a
willybacher
this
beer
was
a
pale
straw
color
with
superior
clarity
which
for
some
reason
i
did
not
expect
being
as
this
is
a
schlenkerla
brew
with
a
rocky
head
the
aroma
is
of
spicy
hops
sweet
bready
malt
and
of
course
smoke
but
much
less
smoke
aroma
than
i
get
from
the
schlenkerla
rauchbiers
because
this
is
not
listed
as
a
rauchbeir
on
the
label
i
was
torn
as
to
what
i
should
think
about
the
smoke
aroma
the
mouthfeel
is
light
clean
and
dry
with
a
light
carbonation
the
first
sip
is
outstanding
wellbalanced
malt
very
crisp
and
dry
hops
dont
come
in
until
the
finish
and
are
coupled
with
a
very
subtle
very
flavorful
and
oddly
refreshing
smoke
tinge
who
really
brewed
this
clearly
not
hellertrum
whos
other
beers
are
sooo
very
smokey
and
intensely
robust
the
smokiness
is
so
subdued
and
complimentary
to
the
rest
of
the
beers
flavor
profile
that
i
can
hardly
believe
its
not
an
added
synthetic
flavor
each
sip
and
the
smokiness
becomes
less
and
less
pronounced
as
my
palate
grows
accustomed
i
ended
up
ordering
a
case
of
this
and
drank
half
of
it
myself
recently
i
caught
up
with
the
local
guy
who
works
for
the
importer
and
he
tells
me
the
brewery
uses
absolutely
no
smoked
malt
apparently
they
just
pass
unsmoked
malt
through
the
same
gristmill
as
the
smoked
malt
and
this
adds
enough
smokey
starches
to
the
brew
he
also
mentioned
they
use
the
same
yeast
strain
as
the
authentic
rauchbier
and
so
these
yeast
may
be
passing
on
smoke
flavors
from
batches
past
either
way
this
is
an
incredible
helles
and
very
worth
your
attention
and
the
attention
of
your
next
cheeseburger
this
would
be
an
incredible
session
beer
if
it
werent
4
a
bottle
this
was
fairly
drinkable
but
i
dont
know
if
i
could
drink
these
all
day
or
night
a
nicer
beer
to
enjoy
but
no
thirst
quencher
very
unique
definitely
recommended
its
interesting
that
reviewers
say
they
love
it
and
then
give
it
a
3
5
i
think
it
has
to
do
with
the
uniqueness
of
the
style
and
our
nongerman
taste
buds
you
love
rauchbier
or
you
dont
im
completely
floored
this
is
the
best
of
both
worlds
when
it
comes
to
an
awesome
europilshelles
and
a
rauchbier
heaven
sent
there
is
something
magical
about
this
beer
infusing
one
with
the
spirit
of
old
bamberg
schlenkerla
is
an
experience
beyond
the
beer
try
it
thanks
for
picking
this
up
eric
frozensoul
i
thoroughly
enjoyed
it
taste
is
smoky
of
course
and
a
rich
grassy
malt
noble
hop
finish
with
a
faint
fruitiness
mouth
is
crisp
if
a
bit
thinnish
this
is
just
so
heavenly
good
one
of
the
better
beers
ive
had
all
year
yummy
looks
liek
a
normal
helles
golden
crisp
looking
yellow
with
one
column
of
bubbles
making
its
way
to
the
top
but
it
doesnt
smell
like
your
normal
helles
its
smoked
but
smoked
cyrstal
and
pale
malts
very
lioght
smokey
aroma
mixed
with
grass
and
pilsnert
malts
tastes
like
a
distant
smokehouse
light
mlating
with
an
equally
light
smoke
flavor
very
unique
one
of
a
kind
edit
found
some
more
of
this
finally
still
love
it
i
could
drink
this
all
day
and
plan
on
buying
a
case
to
keep
around
this
ones
a
keeper
and
worth
seeking
out
wonderful
best
beer
i
have
had
in
a
while
i
quote
crusher
this
beer
rocks
perfect
i
could
drink
these
all
night
if
you
are
looking
for
a
gentle
introduction
to
the
obsession
that
is
rauchbiers
this
is
it
picked
up
a
single
bottle
from
sams
blue
light
in
durham
i
was
told
there
that
although
this
beer
contains
no
smoked
malt
it
is
made
inon
the
same
equipment
with
which
aecht
makes
their
rauchbiers
and
in
turn
picks
up
some
of
that
characteristic
a
nice
gateway
beer
to
rauchbiers
or
when
you
might
want
a
bit
of
a
complement
to
smokey
foods
without
being
overpowering
smoked
ham
flavor
with
a
mildly
hopped
drying
sensation
towards
the
end
a
unique
twist
on
the
style
very
nice
summer
beer
easy
to
drink
and
full
of
flavor
a
unique
offering
a
terrific
treat
one
very
solid
straight
up
goodalicious
helles
lager
light
in
body
and
quite
easy
drinking
a
nice
drinker
thanks
cuz
a
wonderfully
drinkable
lagerrauchbier
pours
out
to
a
bright
gold
color
with
a
small
head
of
white
foam
the
head
calms
quickly
to
a
thin
layer
of
bubbles
over
the
surface
of
the
beer
and
leaves
minimal
amounts
of
lace
on
the
interior
of
the
glass
aromas
of
smoke
and
malt
dance
into
the
nose
with
some
fresh
herbal
characters
mixed
into
the
background
taste
is
great
smoke
and
wood
notes
combine
with
full
maltiness
and
grain
and
a
touch
of
hoppy
bite
some
grassy
elements
as
well
very
nice
mouthfeel
is
rich
yet
not
overpowering
or
thick
drinkability
its
got
it
by
far
the
lager
style
of
this
brew
adds
highly
to
the
ability
to
have
more
than
one
if
it
werent
so
expensive
id
keep
them
on
hand
at
all
times
highly
recommended
drinking

notes

i
can
see
this
beer
being
perfect
for
a
summer
bbq
good
smoke
character
but
still
easy
drinking
its
hard
to
call
this
beer
refreshing
but
i
guess
it
falls
closer
to
that
than
savory
it
seems
like
this
is
a
fresh
sample
but
i
still
like
my
smoked
beers
dark
and
meaty
drinkabilty
i
forced
myself
to
try
to
finish
this
bottle
it
did
not
happen
16
9
ounce
bottle
pours
a
beautiful
straw
yellow
with
nice
carbonation
rising
to
the
top
and
a
nice
white
head
that
doesnt
retain
that
well
the
aroma
is
excellent
with
typical
helles
scents
of
biscuit
and
spicy
hops
along
with
a
subtle
smokiness
after
all
they
pretty
much
only
brew
smoked
beer
at
schlenkerla
that
adds
another
level
of
complexity
to
this
beer
the
flavor
is
similar
to
the
aroma
with
normal
helles
characteristics
biscuit
grainy
malt
spicy
noble
hops
subtle
smokiness
resembles
bacon
and
a
slight
sweetness
likely
residual
sugars
the
mouthfeel
is
light
and
moderately
carbonated
with
a
clean
finish
and
excellent
drinkability
this
was
an
excellent
beer
seems
the
perfect
marriage
of
styles
rauchbier
and
helles
lager
the
subtle
smokiness
is
perfect
ultimately
you
just
have
to
judge
this
beer
for
what
it
is
a
oneof
it
is
truly
neither
a
smoked
beer
nor
a
helles
but
on
its
own
merits
is
quite
well
made
and
damned
enjoyable
after
my
sixth
one
no
not
in
a
row
it
became
very
clear
to
me
that
i
had
found
a
new
favorite
thing
that
i
simply
must
revisit
from
time
to
time
it
rewards
contemplation
for
sure
but
is
even
better
as
a
quaffer
and
leaves
you
thirsting
for
more
when
it
is
gone
pours
as
a
crystal
clear
yellow
color
with
a
suitable
foamy
white
head
the
aroma
is
centered
on
a
subtle
smoke
character
the
smoke
doesnt
jump
out
of
the
glass
like
other
schlenkerla
beers
but
it
is
omnipresent
and
very
appealing
in
addition
to
the
smoke
theres
a
bit
of
grain
and
a
light
malt
character
i
couldnt
get
any
hop
aroma
through
the
smoke
the
taste
like
the
smell
is
pinned
to
the
smokiness
theres
also
a
soft
and
round
malt
quality
finishes
with
just
a
touch
of
bitterness
for
balance
the
beer
is
semidry
with
a
soft
lingering
finish
with
the
smoke
providing
a
flourish
of
flavor
and
not
being
overbearing
this
brew
would
be
a
great
accompaniment
to
lots
of
food
i
wish
i
had
some
horseradish
cheese
drinkability
i
did
not
expect
the
smoky
tones
with
this
beer
when
i
picked
it
up
compared
to
other
beers
produced
here
but
it
was
a
pleasant
surprise
nice
overall
character
worth
seeking
out
500
ml
german
bottle
the
guy
at
wine
warehouse
told
me
they
brew
this
as
a
regular
helles
lager
but
because
they
use
the
same
equipment
to
package
the
beer
some
of
the
smoky
qualities
of
their
rauchbiers
inadvertently
end
up
in
this
beer
not
sure
if
its
true
but
it
would
make
sense
anyway
it
pours
into
the
pilsner
glass
a
clear
yellowgold
with
a
1
finger
head
that
reduces
to
a
thick
and
creamy
layer
of
foam
that
sticks
quite
well
the
aroma
consists
of
toasty
pale
malts
with
a
faint
smokiness
and
a
mild
dose
of
spicy
hops
it
is
initially
quite
crisp
with
a
medium
body
but
the
carbonation
evens
out
and
the
flavor
follows
what
the
scent
hinted
at
its
pretty
tasty
and
the
faint
smoke
adds
an
interesting
twist
to
this
german
lager
substantive
creamy
head
medium
body
with
cream
and
grain
smokey
and
hops
in
finish
as
well
as
metallic
drinkable
but
i
thought
the
smoke
was
more
than
i
would
want
next
time
suitable
carbonation
surprisingly
decent
find
court
liquor
near
the
new
jersey
ocean
another
offering
from
the
schlenkerla
line
and
surprise
surprise
another
stubby
bottle
adorned
with
a
label
in
fraktur
german
after
the
beer
was
poured
the
body
looked
clear
pale
and
well
carbonated
the
head
was
one
finger
thick
and
left
scant
lacing
the
smell
was
only
faintly
smoky
and
would
have
been
hard
to
place
if
i
did
not
know
the
origin
the
taste
was
more
pronounced
in
terms
of
smoked
flavor
although
the
pale
sweet
pilsner
malt
and
the
hint
of
lemon
in
the
taste
were
more
the
primary
tastes
here
unlike
other
beers
from
this
brewery
the
hops
were
also
clearly
evident
like
all
the
other
offerings
from
this
brewery
there
was
a
beer
made
true
to
the
style
under
the
smoked
malt
here
this
would
have
been
a
good
pale
lager
even
if
it
wasnt
faintly
smoky
mouthfeel
drinkability
the
beer
is
light
bodied
the
beer
has
nice
a
nice
crisp
carbonation
this
is
just
an
outstanding
beer
treat
this
is
definately
a
proverbial
session
beer
the
beer
is
easy
to
consume
i
wish
that
i
had
more
overall
i
wasnt
as
impressed
by
this
offering
from
hellertrum
as
i
am
with
their
rauchbier
urbock
or
marzen
i
think
it
had
to
do
mainly
with
the
way
the
hops
bitterness
clashed
with
the
smokey
taste
rather
than
working
together
it
was
like
two
weasels
fighting
in
a
burlap
bag
still
its
good
and
worth
a
try
mouthfeel
and
drinkability
are
downright
huge
this
floats
into
your
mouth
and
the
bottles
gone
before
you
know
it
this
could
be
a
nice
introduction
to
the
general
properties
of
rauchbier
before
going
balls
to
the
wall
with
this
brewerys
other
much
more
intense
offerings
an
excellent
pairing
with
smoked
meats
served
from
a
bottle
with
no
freshness
date
poured
into
a
pilsner
glass
pours
a
clear
straw
color
with
a
white
lacy
head
smoked
smell
is
evident
smells
like
bacon
but
does
not
dominate
the
smell
of
the
beer
also
has
the
sweet
malt
smell
taste
like
someone
took
a
nice
helles
lager
and
put
a
couple
slices
of
bacon
in
it
very
interesting
would
go
great
with
some
smoked
tenderloin
has
pretty
good
mouthfeel
this
beer
isnt
for
everyone
but
i
like
it
and
will
look
for
it
again
the
mouth
is
light
with
crisp
carbonation
this
is
one
hell
of
a
session
beer
as
it
perfectly
balances
flavor
with
low
alcohol
and
damn
near
perfect
drinkability
i
am
buying
more
next
week
this
would
be
a
great
one
to
sip
in
front
of
a
camp
fire
the
taste
of
this
beer
is
considerably
more
complex
first
off
on
the
palate
is
smokiness
but
that
soon
gives
way
to
a
typical
helles
bitterness
then
a
bready
malt
note
and
finally
a
slightly
hoppy
bitter
pinprick
finish
through
all
this
this
beer
slips
over
the
tongue
unsubstantially
with
great
smoothness
the
smoke
flavor
doesnt
get
in
the
way
at
all
this
beer
remains
highly
drinkable
albeit
with
a
smokey
twist
that
increases
its
element
of
interest
andor
mystery
very
interesting
beer
drinkability

if
you
dont
like
the
rauchbier
style
i
would
stay
away
from
this
one
even
though
the
smoke
here
is
quite
subdued
if
you
like
or
even
dont
mind
some
good
smoke
in
your
helles
lager
then
be
sure
to
pick
up
a
few
bottles
of
this
mouthfeeldrinkability
light
to
medium
in
the
mouth
and
effortless
to
drink
what
a
great
alternative
for
this
summer
drinkable
through
the
roof
and
like
jcalbi
said
an
awesome
session
brew
anyone
who
finds
this
on
tap
would
benefit
karmically
from
letting
me
know
where
they
found
it
the
smell
is
essentially
malty
with
light
roasted
notes
a
bit
like
roasted
corn
sweet
with
some
burnt
caramel
the
taste
gets
quite
enjoyable
a
good
lager
showing
a
round
and
smooth
maltiness
combined
with
interesting
notes
of
smoke
some
sweet
fruitiness
too
citrus
some
orange
peel
hints
of
lemon
with
a
light
dry
hoppy
grapefruity
finish
well
balanced
a
more
than
decent
brew
by
schlenkerla
drinkability
although
very
rich
i
could
see
myself
drinking
several
of
these
in
a
row
nobbad
quite
enjoyed
it
lightly
smoked
bacon
flavour
dryish
slightly
herbal
hops
finish
a
bit
salty
aswell
not
as
heavily
smoky
as
there
other
beers
which
on
one
hand
makes
it
easier
to
drink
but
on
the
other
hand
its
less
flavourfull
and
less
complex
i
think
i
prefer
the
marzen
a
lot
more
draught
gbbf
03
at
first
this
beer
reminded
me
of
a
sweet
red
ale
like
oskar
blues
imperial
red
or
northcoast
red
seal
ale
after
about
a
quarter
of
the
beer
was
down
though
i
started
to
realize
the
subtle
hop
flavor
that
those
beers
dont
have
as
well
as
a
much
more
roasted
taste
the
first
time
i
drank
this
beer
i
remember
not
being
too
impressed
but
i
gave
it
a
second
shot
because
its
fairly
cheap
and
i
want
to
review
more
jacks
abby
beers
anyway
this
time
im
finding
it
much
more
enjoyable
a
solid
beer
in
their
lineup
that
leans
more
towards
the
malty
sweetside
that
is
less
common
with
this
brewery
this
beer
does
have
a
lighter
crispness
that
is
like
a
lager
but
gives
off
a
fruit
taste
that
punches
the
tongue
like
an
ale
this
beer
seems
to
want
to
go
places
it
might
not
be
prepared
to
do
the
is
some
promises
as
you
begin
to
sip
this
that
does
not
seem
to
be
fulfilled
notes
such
a
good
lager
very
drinkable
and
very
well
done
cheers
red
tape
doesnt
fall
into
any
one
category
either
consider
this
a
mix
between
a
red
ale
a
dunkelweizen
and
a
helles
lager
at
5
alcvol
this
would
be
a
great
session
beer
allowing
you
to
savor
the
complexities
over
time
overall
this
is
not
jack
abbeys
most
complex
beer
but
it
is
a
damn
good
one
it
has
all
the
malty
features
i
like
in
a
red
ale
and
just
enough
bitterness
to
balance
it
out
if
they
rerelease
this
one
i
will
be
sure
to
grab
it
again
o
a
phenomenal
lager
as
of
right
now
nobody
in
america
makes
lagers
like
jacks
abby
if
i
didnt
know
better
i
wouldve
thought
this
beer
came
straight
from
munich
recommended
notes
this
beer
is
listed
as
a
munich
helles
on
this
site
that
is
clearly
a
mistake
and
youll
learn
that
the
second
you
pour
it
this
is
a
munich
dunkel
or
dark
lager
so
dont
expect
a
helles
god
i
wish
theyd
brew
a
helles
though
palate
pervasive
fruitiness
red
apple
stone
fruit
berries
with
a
bready
slightly
toasty
and
caramelized
backbone
this
beer
strikes
a
pretty
nice
balance
between
toasty
munich
malt
and
fruity
lager
yeast
theres
a
decent
hop
presence
in
the
finish
too
very
tasty
stuff
malty
without
being
overly
rich
it
doesnt
fit
into
any
traditional
category
very
well
but
probably
most
closely
resembles
a
vienna
lager
the
taste
starts
sweetly
malted
with
a
low
bitterness
as
first
but
as
the
beer
warms
the
bitterness
becomes
more
moderate
and
noticeable
very
drinkable
too
overall
all
in
all
this
is
a
pretty
straightforward
munich
dunkel
its
tasty
and
drinkable
its
not
my
favorite
jacks
abby
brew
but
its
still
pretty
good
spritzy
with
a
medium
body
tastes
darker
than
the
color
would
suggest
a
touch
of
sourness
in
the
swallow
very
brief
aftertaste
overall
a
really
nice
refreshing
lager
with
strong
caramel
flavor
and
a
nice
hop
bite
to
counter
complex
flavorful
and
easy
to
drink
definitely
a
beer
i
would
revisit
for
the
price
o
a
simple
but
very
tasty
smooth
and
drinkable
beer
a
simple
beer
for
sure
but
at
the
same
time
its
just
perfectly
balanced
and
quaffable
jacks
abby
can
do
no
wrong
by
me
o
another
very
good
brew
from
jacks
abby
interesting
and
well
balanced
deffinatly
give
this
brew
a
whirl
mouthfeel
is
very
nice
medium
body
with
moderate
carbonation
a
little
chewy
by
no
means
too
much
long
semisweet
finish
this
is
a
good
one
of
course
jacks
abby
doesnt
disappoint
get
it
if
you
see
it
beautiful
feel
and
taste
superclean
but
has
that
unpasteurized
freshness
as
well
that
earthy
balance
definitely
taste
the
munich
malt
the
hops
are
glacier
and
it
shows
with
the
smooth
and
mild
bitterness
but
the
noble
hops
help
highlight
the
the
fruity
esters
ripe
peach
a
kiss
of
caramel
love
this
lager
a
great
drinkable
brew
with
decent
complexities
good
malt
forward
lager
another
solid
brew
from
these
guys
ive
given
up
completely
trying
to
fit
jacks
abbys
beer
into
the
style
cuz
they
never
do
you
really
just
need
to
go
into
it
with
a
blank
pallete
and
taste
away
this
beer
is
no
exception
to
that
its
like
a
very
americanized
german
dunkel
mixed
with
an
american
session
red
ale
but
with
that
super
smooth
and
slick
lager
flavor
like
jas
jabby
brau
unique
but
very
good
a
killer
session
beer
for
sure
o
a
finely
crafted
dark
lager
everything
i
hoped
and
expected
the
style
to
be
another
great
brew
from
jacks
abby
overall
not
bad
light
diacetyl
a
bit
under
attenuated
not
bad
otherwise
medium
bodied
and
balanced
towards
sweet
falls
somewhere
between
a
dunkel
and
a
maerzen
beerandwhiskeyhq
com
first
i
hate
the
name
if
id
noticed
it
i
would
never
have
tried
it
but
im
really
glad
i
did
i
dont
buy
lager
much
and
usually
only
drink
it
when
i
have
to
but
ill
be
buying
this
again
its
an
oddlooking
color
murky
orange
not
really
appetizing
but
the
smell
has
an
alluring
floral
character
taste
is
rather
complex
for
a
lager
highly
quaffable
thanks
to
dan
for
the
recommendation
so
i
really
wanted
to
like
this
this
beer
is
brewed
fairly
close
to
where
i
grew
up
and
i
was
excited
to
see
this
brewery
start
to
bottle
and
flourish
unfortunately
when
drinking
this
beer
all
i
think
about
is
how
this
isnt
anything
better
than
a
budweiser
its
a
fine
lager
and
does
the
job
but
there
are
much
better
craft
beers
out
there
also
wish
the
dating
machine
had
hit
the
labels
on
this
sixpack
but
the
store
proprietor
assured
me
this
beer
hit
the
store
last
week
overall
this
is
one
hell
of
a
beer
that
you
can
get
anyone
to
drink
and
theyll
come
back
for
more
hats
off
to
the
brewery
on
this
one
beer
is
medium
in
body
with
carbonation
of
low
intensity
leading
to
a
full
smooth
45
and
slightly
foamy
15
mouthfeel
thats
good
for
the
beer
and
the
style
closes
dry
with
light
to
mediumlight
stickiness
lingering
on
the
palate
and
lips
o
if
im
going
to
drink
this
style
i
would
choose
something
from
germany
i
really
wanted
to
like
this
more
but
its
pretty
average
in
my
opinion
bright
but
rich
disappears
off
the
tongue
with
a
flash
of
sweetness
can
be
enjoyed
by
the
gallon
church
street
brewing
heavenly

tasted
like
a
becks
seek
this
beer
out
and
drink
it
with
gusto
finally
getting
a
chance
to
enjoy
a
pint
from
the
source
good
people
the
beer
pours
a
clear
straw
topped
by
a
finger
of
white
foam
the
nose
comprises
fresh
grass
light
flowers
and
dry
wheaty
biscuit
the
taste
brings
in
more
of
the
same
the
hops
shining
brightly
without
coming
across
as
something
younger
folks
might
deem
hoppy
the
body
is
a
hefty
light
with
a
light
moderate
carbonation
and
a
drying
finish
overall
a
damn
solid
helles
one
of
the
better
american
versions
ive
had
i
look
forward
to
seeing
more
of
this
around
shallow
and
pedantic
a
miller
lite
with
some
spice
wonderfully
drinkable
this
brew
is
clean
and
satisfying
close
to
10
years
of
cra
ft
beer
geekdom
living
in
both
the
philly
suburbs
and
south
central
pa
and
i
have
yet
to
try
this
victory
offering
looking
around
for
something
new
and
unpretentious
this
called
out
to
me
today
from
the
shelves
an
average
pour
yields
slightly
less
than
a
fingers
worth
of
audibly
fizzy
crisp
offwhite
colored
froth
that
displays
minimal
to
no
retention
it
leaves
behind
a
thin
veil
of
splotchy
lacing
an
thin
collar
the
color
is
an
exceedingly
pale
golden
straw
a
light
to
moderate
bit
of
average
paced
carbonation
rises
randomly
throughout
the
nose
is
simple
and
clean
loaded
with
rich
bready
malts
and
cereal
grains
a
light
euro
hop
presence
on
the
palate
this
one
is
a
bit
of
a
subdued
version
of
the
nose
perhaps
you
can
mix
in
a
touch
of
lemon
zest
as
well
the
mouthful
is
on
the
fuller
side
of
light
bodied
a
bit
thin
a
very
limited
bit
of
carbonation
bite
goes
down
rather
uneventfully
a
simple
and
somewhat
enjoyable
beer
but
in
the
future
id
much
rather
opt
for
the
prima

of
this
lager
worth
checking
out
if
you
can
get
this
fresh
tolerable
but
uninspired
its
like
they
werent
trying
i
sense
theres
a
reason
this
was
removed
from
the
variety
pack
this
is
a
decent
lager
a
statement
that
for
me
is
often
an
oxymoron
it
meets
the
criteria
for
a
munich
helles
lager
in
most
details
except
for
the
presence
of
chill
haze
not
only
does
it
meet
criteria

it

i
may
have
to
buy
some
more
of
this

on

at

all
i
ask
from
a
beer
nothing
more
nothing
less
bring
it
prost
this
new
product
is
so
average
and
tasteless
o
admittedly
lagers
are
not
my
favorite
style
in
fact
theyre
one
of
my
least
favorite
styles
but
i
can
appreciate
when
someone
hits
the
nail
on
the
head
and
brews
a
good
one
thats
exactly
what
victory
has
done
here
theres
nothing
over
the
top
here
theres
no
flavors
thatd
scare
away
a
bmc
drinker
this
is
a
just
a
pure
clean
highly
enjoyable
lager
i
look
forward
to
bringing
this
with
me
to
bbqs
during
the
summer
months

good
easy

me
as
hallertau
hops
very
slight

this
is
a

the

and
light
with
the

a
slight

coupled
with
a

the

profile
crisp

clean

with
a

o
the
aroma
may
not
have
been
up
to
snuff
but
the
actual
taste
of
the
beer
was
and
thats
all
i
really
care
about
theres
nothing
like
a
good
lager
in
the
right
mood
and
this
hit
that
right
mood
extremely
well
o
a
pretty
good
stab
at
the
helles
style
not
as
honed
as
the
best
of
them
but
its
free
of
flaws
and
drinks
nicely
pretty
good
stuff
i
could
see
a
six
pack
disappearing
quickly
on
a
nice
day
oa
boring
bland
nothing
new
lager
no
reason
to
have
other
than
the
tick
o
not
a
bad
beer
but
there
are
munich
helles
that
are
much
better
not
a
bad
flavor
and
id
drink
this
again
but
probably
wouldnt
buy
it
decent
beer
but
there
are
many
better
munich
helles
spaten
lowenbrau
hofbrau
and
others
overall
a
step
up
from
bmc
and
just
enough
flavor
to
impress
a
craft
veteran
like
me
this
beer
has
it
all
give
it
a
try
really
solid
lager
definitely
has
a
more
hoppy
profile
than
traditional
helles
great
balance
overall
o
this
beer
is
easy
to
drink
and
very
well
balanced
it
is
a
good
representation
of
the
style
i
could
drink
this
all
day
long
if
i
was
sitting
in
a
biergarten
o
very
enjoyable
and
easy

drink
reminds

the

i
would

if
you

something
simple
and
extremely
easy
to
drink
yet
miles
ahead

look
no

it

and
stands
out

above
other
flagship
lagers
cough
boston
lager
cough
this
beer
was
ok
it
would
basically
put
this
beer
into
the
lawn
mower
category
the
beer
poured
a
clear
pale
yellow
with
a
nice
white
head
that
produced
a
small

head
the
beer
gave
off
a
nice

aroma
with
a
hint
of
citrus
hops
i
think
the
taste
of
the
beer
was
good
mostly
grainy
but
overall
the
beer
was
well
balanced
the
beer
had
a
light
clean
and
crisp
feel
and
it
was
extremely
easy
to
drink
i
had
a
couple
without
even
noticing
overall
a
fine
example
of
the
style
from
one
of
the
best
breweries

a
rather
nice
lager
a

puts
this
a
cut
above
industrial
fare
refreshing
would
be
great
on
a
hot
day
too
bad
its
a
bit
expensive
over
here
for
everyday
drinking
worth
sampling
this
a
well
balanced
very
smooth
easily
drinkable
beer
lagers
usually
bore
my
palate
and
this
one
is
really
no
different
except
for
the
fact
that
it
is
so
damn
good
it
is
crisp
as
can
be
has
more
than
a
watery
body
and
is
not
a
corn
beer
it
pours
light
and
thin
but
has
enough
to
it
that
it
works
with
big
food
it
is
really
refreshing
with
that
german
style
malting
that
leaves
it
flavorful
and
distinct
helles
style
i
believe
wouldnt
chose
it
over
most
other
victory
beers
but
this
one
is
proof
that
a
golden
lager
made
in
the
usa
can
still
excite
from
time
to
time
light
bodied
dry
plenty
of
carbonation
not
my
favorite
lager
by
any
means
not
the
worst
either
but
plenty
of
room
for
improvement
o
easy
drinking
munich
helles
decent
for
the
style
good
for
me
o
not
that
complex
at
all
but
then
it
does
hit
all
the
style
notes
well
if
six
packs
were
cheaper
id
buy
this
more
pours
a
clear
golden
with
a
high
white
head
the
smell
robust
yet
crisp
grain
with
some
herbal
and
floral
notes
the
taste
is
clean
malt
crisp
hops
sweet
grainy
notes
some
mineral
tang
its
sharply
carbonated
slightly
viscous
all
in
all
an
excellent
helles
easy
to
drink
and
very
satisfying
lighter
body
higher
carbonation
tingly
and
a
little
dry
on
the
tongue
a
solid
drinkable
lager
once
again
from
victory
a
nice
example
of
the
style
overall
just
about
what
one
could
hope
for
o
incredibly
easy
drinking
and
a
prime
candidate
for
a
gateway
beer
for
your
bmc
drinking
buddies
highly
sessionable
and
light
on
the
palette
taste
is
light
and
crisp
with
some
biscuit
grain
and
a
fair
amount
of
bright
hops
both
flavoring
and
bittering
i
like
this
beer
quite
a
bit
not
necessarily
a
classic
helles
but
damn
is
it
refreshing
and
tasty
i
would
have
no
problem
finishing
off
a
sixer
of
this
in
a
day
tasty
clean
and
interesting
just
what
i
want
in
a
nice
lager
excellent
beer
i
see
a
repeat
purchase
in
my
very
near
future
light
to
medium
body
slightly
heavier
than
your
average
lager
crisp
clean
taste
but
some
slight
lingering
of
barley
malts
in
the
finish
hops
add
the
crispness
and
have
a
small
bittering
effect
that
balances
out
the
barley
definitely
a
twinge
of
citrus
in
the
taste
adding
a
level
of
complexity
that
you
dont
find
in
a
whole
lot
of
lagers
higher
carbonation
adds
to
the
crispness
this
is
just
a
beer
that
is
not
overly
complex
but
they
definitely
paid
attention
to
the
details
and
brewed
a
solid
lager
with
more
flavor
than
most
others
youll
find
out
there
definitely
no
off
adjunct
flavors
probably
the
best
part
of
this
beer
great
for
a
hot
summer
day
that
calls
for
a
light
and
refreshing
beer
that
tastes
pretty
damn
good
too
o
really
good
lager
too
bad
craft
breweries
dont
put
out
more
examples
of
these
beers
as
you
may
know
i
am
generally
not
a
fan
of
plain
ol
lagersthe
nonpilsener
and
nonoktoberfest
kind
so
i
did
not
expect
much
from
this
that
said
it
is
what
it
is
not
supposed
to
be
extraordinary
just
an
everydaytype
session
brew
its
rather
average
at
that
because
i
know
theres
better
offerings
in
this
style
out
there
a
good
easy
drinking
beer
a
smooth
sutle
malt
forward
style
thats
sure
to
please
on
tap
at
the
brewpub
pours
a
clear
light
gold
with
a
white
head
nose
is
fairly
mild
with
a
pleasant
fresh
grain
and
a
light
hop
note
mouth
is
snappy
bright
super
fresh
grain
and
a
kiss
of
sweet
malt
a
touch
grassy
in
its
hop
element
this
was
one
i
overlooked
for
awhile
but
its
just
fantastic
understated
extraordinarily
well
balanced
of
course
criminally
underrated
one
of
the
best
lagers
ive
ever
had
up
there
with
victorys
best
pilsners
they
are
masters
with
this
style
overall
a
good
example
of
a
lawn
mower
beer
pours
a
very
clear
goldenrod
color
that
resembles
a
very
watery
american
lager
the
head
is
fluffy
and
white
but
disappears
in
a
blink
smells
a
bit
more
german
than
it
appears
with
a
little
pepper
and
grain
the
taste
is
so
much
betters
than
the
look
and
scent
if
i
saw
this
beer
in
a
glass
not
knowing
what
it
was
i
would
pass
it
by
buy
the
flavor
is
on
point
i
get
grainy
breaded
malts
herbal
hop
notes
and
that
peppery
feel
that
is
necessary
for
the
style
carbonation
is
lower
but
very
striking
and
the
beer
goes
down
easy
buy
it
gets
too
sweet
as
it
warms
so
its
a
gulper
overall
a
good
representation
but
could
be
a
little
cheaper
im
my
opinion
for
what
it
is
d
clean
and
well
balanced
with
a
decent
malt
character
this
is
a
drinkable
helles
but
not
as
flavorful
as
some
others
that
i
have
had
overall
a
pleasant
likable
allmalt
lager
a
nice
oldschool
aspect
to
this
beer
light
goldcaramel
color
with
good
head
retention
moderate
bittering
with
a
bit
of
fresh
grain
popping
through
in
the
middle
finish
is
even
with
the
barest
hint
of
honey
sweetness
could
be
a
little
smoother
around
the
edges
but
overall
quite
nicely
done
this
is
definitely
better
on
tap
had
both
on
a
trip
out
to
allentown
an
intense
pride
for
victory
out
there
and
they
are
the
best
brewery
by
volume
in
my
opinion
so
im
all
for
it
few
do
it
like
then
quality
wise
mass
production
worldlyness
isnt
easy
and
with
that
said
this
is
a
great
brew
with
an
american
yeast
augmentation
or
accent
look
is
good
some
subdued
head
but
i
cant
tell
if
it
was
due
to
the
humidity
gold
clear
pour
nice
hay
and
bubble
gummy
esters
export
sweet
nose
palate
is
dry
but
not
pilsner
nice
balance
apple
rind
bubble
gum
and
hay
dry
nice
balence
and
some
porter
grape
hopping
but
with
a
brisk
finish
that
has
hints
of
biscuit
o
this
is
a
very
good
brew
perfect
for
summer
cookouts
overall
again
i
am
very
impressed
by
this
beer
i
just
hope
i
can
find
some
fresher
examples
d
fantastic
representation
of
the
style
especially
for
an
american
brewery
plan
on
enjoying
this
again
in
the
future
overall
wonderful
flavors
but
the
delicacy
and
smoothness
make
this
borderline
too
chuggable
even
when
im
looking
to
get
trashed
i
want
to
savor
a
beer
a
bit
but
still
very
delicious
and
a
sure
recommendation
for
someone
who
hates
hops
o
this
one
was
in
dire
need
of
a
little
something
special
to
make
it
interesting
meh
this
beer
was
a
nice
looking
light
copper
color
the
head
was
fizzy
and
white
kind
of
faded
off
after
a
few
minutes
the
aromas
here
are
oh
hops
and
malt
pretty
much
there
might
be
a
little
wooden
aromas
too
but
not
much
the
flavor
is
pretty
hoppy
there
is
a
little
bit
of
a
earthy
tone
in
the
aftertaste
the
malts
leave
some
dryness
behind
as
well
the
mouthfeel
is
quite
drinkable
this
beer
is
pretty
good
and
deserves
a
try
future
edit
in
mind
overall
this
is
a
very
well
made
true
to
munich
style
lager
easy
drinker
with
pleasant
light
flavorings
anyone
and
everyone
can
enjoy
this
brew
whether
your
a
ba
or
not
d
not
great
packaged
in
a
mized
case
with
hopdevil
prima
pils
and
golden
monkey
i
know
which
beer
will
be
my
last
resort
every
time
i
visit
the
fridge
victory
v
lager
is
a
cloudy
pale
yellow
beer
with
a
small
white
head
that
quickly
dissipates
it
has
a
soft
herbal
aroma
it
smells
a
little
sweet
and
corny
and
very
faint
its
light
bodied
and
foamy
with
a
dry
finish
thats
kind
of
chalky
it
has
hardly
any
flavor
there
may
be
a
touch
of
lemon
and
mint
or
catnip
there
is
no
bitterness
sorry
victory
ive
peed
better
beer
this
is
an
obvious
attempt
to
make
a
superbowl
beer
and
they
nailed
it
pours
a
clear
goldenstraw
color
with
a
short
white
head
carbonation
bubbles
are
apparent
head
does
not
stick
around
for
all
that
long
the
nose
is
a
bit
grainy
with
some
pilsner
malt
and
a
bit
of
floral
and
herbal
hops
the
taste
brings
a
bit
more
of
the
hop
components
of
the
nose
along
with
some
grain
in
the
background
light
body
with
good
carbonation
and
a
dry
finish
drinks
quite
well
very
quaffable
this
is
a
nice
session
brew
beer
is
thin
and
wet
with
a
decent
finish
with
a
mild
acidity
that
i
kind
of
wish
wasnt
there
i
think
this
is
more
like
a
czech
pils
than
a
helles
it
has
nearly
nothing
between
the
lead
off
sweetness
and
the
finishing
acidity
no
middle
ground
flavors
its
definitely
not
bad
and
since
its
a
german
lager
not
only
would
i
have
more
of
it
i
would
drink
a
case
one
day
very
drinkable
though
i
could
see
some
of
the
flavors
sticking
around
too
long
for
more
than
a
few
i
was
given
a
few
of
these
at
a
family
dinner
over
the
holidays
this
brewery
is
local
but
ive
never
had
this
before
and
was
looking
forward
to
it
i
popped
the
cap
and
poured
and
was
instantly
disappointed
very
little
head
and
a
cheap
beer
color
the
smell
wasnt
all
that
pleasing
and
the
taste
was
worse
easily
the
worst
microbrew
lager
ive
had
thank
god
i
didnt
have
to
pay
for
it
i
never
will
not
when
i
can
buy
yuengling
for
less
and
not
ever
be
wishing
i
didnt
although
i
typically
drink
hoppier
beers
im
always
happy
to
see
this
beer
in
my
fridge
on
a
hot
day
notes
if
it
had
more
body
and
had
a
better
look
and
smell
i
am
sure
my
ratings
would
have
been
higher
this
is
a
reasonable
alternative
to
other
lagers
but
i
think
that
there
are
better
ones
out
there
in
the
craft
beer
world
thanks
again
to
bruce
for
seeing
to
it
that
i
was
able
to
try
this
one
tonight
overall
this
is
another
very
good
lager
from
victory
very
smooth
and
i
wish
i
had
access
to
this
more
regularly
very
well
worth
a
shot
despite
its
flaws
on
appearance
and
smell
i
still
enjoyed
this
beer
it
still
loses
to
the
better
german
brands
and
stoudts
gold
lager
but
id
definitely
session
this
one
excellent
drinkability
id
love
to
session
this
beer
but
its
hard
to
find
in
sixers
picked
this
up
as
a
single
worth
a
try
if
you
can
find
it
but
i
wouldnt
really
go
out
of
my
way
to
drink
it
again
d
one
of
the
better
lagers
ive
had
bravo
victory
this
is
not
nearly
as
good
as
prima
pils
but
its
a
very
well
done
lager
from
victory
they
know
how
to
do
nice
german
lagers
that
is
for
sure
my
only
complaints
are
that
this
is
a
bit
uneven
head
is
very
disappointing
and
the
feel
is
off
a
bit
but
where
it
really
counts
flavor
this
one
delivers
ive
moved
on
to
other
styles
but
recently
revisited
my
first
it
poured
golden
and
clear
with
little
head
and
slight
effervescence
clean
sweet
aroma
and
crisp
clean
malt
flavor
on
the
watery
side
compared
to
other
styles
but
fine
for
a
lager
overall
very
drinkable
a
nice
easy
drinking
helles
lager
overall
i
think
this
beer
could
use
a
tad
bit
more
flavor
and
mouthfeel
to
be
a
truly
great
lager
but
its
still
pretty
good
good
interpretation
of
the
munich
helles
style
very
easy
drinking
refreshing
served
to
me
cold
with
a
full
fluffy
white
head
gold
in
color
with
sharp
clarity
smells
pretty
good
bread
hay
and
honey
palate
is
quite
sweet
with
a
good
honey
and
cracker
malt
flavor
finishes
with
just
a
touch
of
grassy
hop
flavor
overall
a
strong
option
when
in
search
of
a
refreshing
mild
flavored
lager
without
adjuncts
okay
carbonation
very
light
bodied
watery
very
straightforwardly
nice
but
kinda
light
on
flavor
almost
to
the
point
of
blandness
though
that
makes
it
really
easy
to
drink
and
to
drink
a
lot
of
it
i
think
it
is
okay
but
far
from
the
class
of
say
weihenstephaner
original
premium
even
though
that
had
to
make
a
trip
from
overseas
some
times
i
tend
to
forget
about
lagers
and
more
sessionable
simple
beers
this
is
probably
the
best
lager
ive
ever
had
might
be
a
new
summer
go
to
beer
if
only
bmc
could
make
a
lager
with
this
much
flavor
the
beers
a
lot
better
than
i
anticipated
lager
and
maybe
a
hint
of
spicy
hops
the
grainyness
in
the
nose
carries
through
to
the
taste
with
a
minimal
amount
of
diacetyl
butteryness

all
malt

has
officially
changed
my
stance
its
easily
my
favorite
pale
lager
and
without
it
the
beer
would
be
too
thin
relax
with
this
guy
which
was
much
bigger
in
body
and
flavor
i
guess
this
is
meant
for
more
mass
appeal
sweet
clear
but
just
bold
enough
to
take
this
a
few
steps
beyond
the
macros
the
mouthfeel
is
crisp
but
doesnt
last
too
long
the
drinkability
is
second
to
none
some
think
this
is
a

bland

its

that
anyone
who
purchased

found
as

overall
a

from

tasters
pack
definitely
the
lone
winner
in
my
mind
a
nice
canadian
option
of
an
under
represented
style
not
a
review
please
ignore
i
thought
this
was
pretty
good
nice
refreshing
nothing
special
but
not
offensive
i
had
yet
to
encounter
this
one
on
tap
in
this
city
so
figured
id
take
the
plunge
and
enjoy
a
20
oz
pint
this
style
is
a
bit
of
a
rarity
when
it
comes
to
what
western
canadian
micros
usually
tackle
and
as
an
unabashed
lowenbrau
fan
i
was
intrigued
a
pleasant
goldenrod
brassy
color
with
a
few
white
bubbles
this
brew
smells
like
good
old
prairie
pilsener
malt
with
a
moderate
dose
of
noble
hop
green
spiciness
popcorn
and
cracker
malts
and
a
little
toast
buttress
some
sour
green
fruit
gooseberry
and
crabapple
notes
some
cooked
corn
dms
flavor
and
a
little
green
vegetation
from
the
hops
not
particularly
assertive
in
the
latter
regard
however
is
that
diacetyl
as
well
this
one
is
quite
sweet
and
sour
in
the
finish
with
a
fair
degree
of
carbonation
the
final
assessment
this
actually
reminds
me
a
bit
of
a
kolsch
or
even
certain
czech
pilseners
in
terms
of
the
malt
flavor
profile
and
the
presence
of
subtle
fruit
flavors
that
yield
a
rather
cidery
character
still
falls
within
style
guidelines
i
suppose
i
prefer
the
european
examples
i
have
tried
o
generic
commercial
lager
cheers
okanagan
spring
1516
this
brew
pours
with
a
clear
golden
color
not
much
in
the
aroma
department
the
flavor
is
a
very
pleasant
layer
of
malts
and
a
clean
finish
overall
i
rate
this
as
a
decent
beer
refreshing
i
discount
that
the
tasting
was
done
on
a
ski
trip
to
canada
a
day
of
skiing
great
powder
does
make
any
beer
taste
good
having
factored
in
the
positive
environment
the
okanagan

still
does
shine

sweetness

flavour

with
some
cornlike
dms
light
body
is
somewhat
gassy
with
a
texture
that
is
a
bit
on
the
watery
side
a
mild
butterscotch
note
of
diacetyl
appears
as
it
warms
this
starts
out
as
a
very
average
lager
in
terms
of
appearance
and
smell
has
a
nice
thin
feel
of
a
lager
and
a
good
crisp
taste
where
the
beer
sets
its
self
apart
from
most
lagers
is
the
nice
smooth
finish
with
little
after
taste
its
a
great
beer
for
a
hot
day
and
the
quality
ingredients
of
reinheitsgebot
make
for
a
smooth
delicious
lager
overall
an
easy
drinking
bavarian
lager
by
okanagan
spring
clean
crisp
a
very
simple
brew
that
doesnt
try
to
overcomplicate
flavour
could
easily
be
a
session
brew
d
excellent
beer
for
a
hot
day
this
a
lager
done
the
right
way
with
an
actual
hop
presence
to
it
as
a
side
note
not
so
great
after
it
warms
up
really
good
overall
though
i
guess
i
liked
this
one
more
then
the
average
ba
for
style
i
thought
it
was
pretty
good
i
consider
this
a
macro
at
this
point
but
its
miles
ahead
of
the
other
mass
produced
brews
o
i
find
this
to
be
a
nice
drinkable
beer
is
there
better
out
there
yes
there
is
with
that
said
this
is
another
good
brew
that
is
suitable
more
for
warm
weather
although
i
think
id
quite
enjoy
this
throughout
an
evening
due
to
the
lite
body
this
has
this
isnt
the
best
offering
by
okanagan
spring
but
i
still
think
this
is
worthy
of
trying
out
and
is
definitely
better
than
an
everyday
macro
overall
this
is
a
betterthanaverage
lager
its
bavarian
inspiration
is
apparent
and
pleasing
o
subpar
lager
probably
a
bit
worse
than
canadian
macros
this
really
pissed
me
off
not
the
beers
fault
the
menu
stated
this
beer
adheres
to
the
bavarian
beer
purity
law
of
1516
which
states
that
no
beer
is
to
be
made
with
preservatives
or
chemicals
the
lack
of
preservatives
is
fine
but
being
a
chemist
i
was
a
little
angered
at
the
notion
that
there
were
no
chemicals
in
this
beer
since
by
definition
water
and
every
other
molecule
in
this
beer
are
chemicals
i
know
im
just
being
prissy
but
still

a
decent
b
d
not
much
to
say
about
this
one
better
then
a

but
nothing
special
it
gets
the
job
done
wouldnt
say
no
if
i
was
offered
it
overall
this
is
a
refreshing
beer
would
be
good
for
in

summer
would
recommend
this

body
of
the
beer
is
light
and
fairly
crisp
with
light
flavours
of
cooked
vegetables
and
malt
at
times
i
felt
like
i
could
have
been
drinking
a
bud
that
is
not
a
compliment
allinall
not
a
bad
beer
nothing
to
write
home
about
but
considering
okanagan
springs
was
purchased
by
sleemans
and
isnt
really
a
true
craft
brewery
anymore
this
is
pretty
decent
d
although
this
isnt
the
most
flavorful
beer
id
reach
for
this
before
any
macro
beer
any
day
its
a
refreshing
lager
and
it
has
its
place
lets
be
honest
sometimes
you
just
feel
like
pounding
a
couple
of
beers
back
and
this
one
does
the
trick
nicely
drinkability
goes
down

well

a
variety

occasions

i
can

quencher
and
i
think
this
is
one
i
liked
okanagans
baltic
porter
too
so
it
looks
like
they
do
some
good
things
out
there
d
a
decent
drinker
german
munich
helles
dont
really
travel
all
that
well
part
of
this
is
specific
to
the
style
itself
but
much
of
it
has
to
do
with
the
fact
that
most
commercial
examples
that
make
it
over
here
are
so
ridden
with
preservatives
that
they
really
taste
like
a
ghost
of
their
unpasteurized
self
its
good
to
know
now
that
some
canadian
brewers
have
started
to
fill
the
gap
a
fairly
pleasant
if
a
little
tame
example
of
the
style
i
do
now
recall
tiring
of
its
onedimensionality
when
sessioning
it
all
those
years
ago
postuniversity
but
overall
its
a
decent
enough
goto
when
you
just
want
a
wellmade
lager
of
canadian
provenance
pours
a
good
golden
color
with
a
foamy
head
some
lacing
as
well
a
bit
light
in
the
nose
snappy
hops
and
a
little
maltiness
taste
follows
with
light
flavors
light
bready
malt
and
a
little
bit
o
hops
would
have
appreciated
a
bit
more
pronounced
flavors
but
thats
ok
the
balance
is
pretty
decent
keeps
it
pretty
drinkable
another
easy
drinker
overall
this
is
an
easydrinking
lager
thats
a
step
above
macros
thinking
this
beer
might
make
a
nice
introductory
helles
lager
for
my
friends
who
still
reside
in
macrolagerland
had
this
beer
for
the
first
time
on
a
run
up
to
canada
was
served
ontap
and
was
a
very
popular
beer
at
the
bar
the
color
was
pretty
good
a
nice
amber
the
smell
and
taste
were
also
nice
what
a
straight
beer
should
taste
like
in
my
opinion
overall
a
very
nice
beer
to
have
while
hanging
out
with
some
friends
at
the
bar
this
is
a
beer
you
will
find
everywhere
in
vancouver
restaurants
bars
etc
it
scares
no
one
and
also
challenges
no
one
the
beer
pours
yellow
gold
with
a
nice
head
the
nose
is
pretty
well
nonexistent
the
taste
is
fairly
crisp
lager
with
a
slightly
sweet
finish
it
has
one
hand
in
the
old
world
but
still
tastes
a
bit
like
molson
canadian
not
bad
but
order
the
pale
ale
instead
if
ok
springs
is
the
only
choice
as
far
as
lagers
go
this
is
a
good
one
easy
drinking
and
the
flavour
has
a
freshness
to
it
a
bunch
of
these
in
a
cooler
on

you

the
head
is
definitely
better
than
average
however
it
poured
with
a
perfect
amount
of
head
neither
overdone
nor
underdone
offwhite
thick
but
fairly
ephemeral
as
it
dissipates
to
a
thin
layer
the
lace
leaving
thin
serpentine
patches
on
a
sweltering
day
the
appearance
screams
drink
me
the
aroma
is
grainy
lightly
toasted
with
subtle
tart
milkiness
like
so
many
german
lagers
hops
are
well
balanced
with
some
delicate
spiciness
and
grass
again
very
german
aroma
fittingly
enough
the
taste
is
brisk
refreshing
and
thirst
quenching
good
caramel
malt
up
front
with
a
definite
hop
burst
on
the
finish
leaving
the
mouth
with
a
balanced
not
overly
sweet
or
dry
feel
the
freshness
of
the
toasted
malt
is
superb
in
this
beer
roasted
to
perfection
a
true
credit
to
barley
light
butterscotch
and
even
subtle
lemon
in
the
taste
the
mouthfeel
is
high
carbonation
light
to
medium
bodied
and
invigoratingly
quenching
the
drinkability
being
neither
offensive
strong
or
heavy
is
very
good
an
ideal
summer
brew
not
to
indicate
however
that
this
has
little
tasteon
the
contrary
it
is
very
flavourful
this
is
one
beer
i
buy
quite
consistently
if
i
go
out
to
buy
a
sixpack
for
a
hot
summer
day
this
usually
is
the
standard
a
credit
to
its
name
1516
is
a
natural
refreshing
germanstyle
lager
thx
enough
of
the
personal
essay
lets
get
down
to
business
this
1516
poured
out
of
its
341
ml
brown
bottle
a
refreshing
clear
golden
hue
but
the
erruption
of
bubbles
i
mistook
for
a
head
fell
back
immediately
has
a
crisp
haymalt
smell
to
it
light
flowery
hops
rounding
it
off
flavour
is
the
light
average
of
a
crisp
lager
a
decent
balance
and
it
goes
down
smooth
however
not
much
else
going
on
to
make
it
stand
out
either
this
is
a
decent
enough
lager
id
buy
it
again
for
another
patiobarbecuing
session
especially
in
mixed
company
macro
drinkers
nonbeer
drinkers
and
beer
snobs
alike
but
id
reserve
it
for
hot
weather
refreshment
by
no
means
would
i
make
it
a
standard
of
mine
still
id
buy
this
hands
down
over
any
macro
on
the
market
o
well
i
wish
i
could
find
some
sort
of
dating
code
on
this
beer
but
theres
not
even
an
inkjet
number
on
the
bottle
im
rather
afraid
that
the
local
distro
is
passing
off
last
years
batch
because
this
tastes
nothing
like
a
helles
ought
to
pours
a
light
clear
gold
with
a
nice
light
stream
of
carbonation
the
head
is
thinner
white
and
leaves
some
nicer
small
sticky
lacing
the
aroma
is
almost
nonexistent
with
very
faint
notes
of
bread
and
hops
the
taste
is
more
assertive
but
still
pretty
mild
its
not
bland
but
it
doesnt
have
the
depth
of
flavor
other
helles
lagers
have
its
not
at
all
heavy
nor
should
it
be
and
is
light
and
crisp
o
well
made
munich
helles
that
is
a
great
pick
for
spring
very
basic
grainy
taste
its
drinkable
but
doesnt
stand
out
straightforward
lager
average
all
around
could
drink
a
few
if
offered
overall
love
how
light
and
sessionable
this
beer
is
with
the
right
amount
of
malt
and
hop
flavor
makes
me
think
of
warm
weather
to
come
i
could
easily
have
a
few
of
these
in
a
row
a
good
solid
beer
the
pour
was
a
golden
color
the
aroma
was
of
hops
the
taste
was
very
crisp
light
and
clean
the
hops
came
through
but
not
overly
powering
this
is
definitely
a
good
go
to
beer
this
would
be
great
with
warner
weather
or

expected

really

a

overall
a
very
good
take
on
a
german
style
lager
good
crisp
bready
malt
notes
with
a
solid
noble

balance
o
perhaps
slightly
hoppier
and
less
maltier
than
its
german

regardless
its
a
solid
munich
helles
and
a
welcome
winter
sight
on
retail
shelves
in
michigan
nice
job
southern
tier
sweet
cracker
notes
dominate
along
with
breadiness
thankfully
the
booze
was
weak
in
this
as
i
couldnt
taste
it
and
could
barely
feel
it
by
the
time
i
finished
this
off
i
like
my
beers
bright
when
it
comes
to
the
flavor
and
this
felt
a
bit
flat
for
me
even
if
the
mouthfeel
was
certainly
crisp
enough
sure
this
would
be
a
decent
choice
once
the
weather
warms
up
but
by
itself
this
reminded
me
too
much
of
the
eurotrash
pilz
not
one
of
southern
tiers
better
offerings
a
fantastic
spring
lager
bright
clean
easy
drinking
with
some
sweetness
gold
in
color
with
amazing
clarity
tall
creamy
white
head
great

sweet
grainy
pils

aroma
sweet
and
malty
flavor
to
match
with
a
touch
of
noble
hops
to
round
it
out
incredibly
clean
and
smooth
an
excellent
version
of
a
style
that
i
am
really
growing
to
love
southern
tier
absolutely
nailed
this
one
gimmicky
name
awesome
beer
a
very
refreshing
wellbalanced
helles
an
excellent
example
of
the
style
a
great
choice
for
an
easydrinking
lager
trying
to
chase
the
polar
weather
away
by
auditioning
beers
for
a
leading
role
on
my
deck
this
summer
and
this
one
is
a
real
contender
crystal
clear
light
golden
pour
with
1
foamy
head
that
hung
around
for
a
minute
or
two
and
hung
some
lace
on
the
glass
the
whole
way
down
light
hops
smell
maybe
some
bread
perfect
carbonation
and
a
crisp
refreshing
taste
that
you
could
handle
all
day
long
hope
i
can
get
lots
more
of
this
as
summer
approaches
tasted
pretty
plain
for
lager
what
a
perfectly
balanced
beer
very
refreshing
and
easy
to
enjoy
crisp
fruity
citric
leafy
hop
flavor
in
perfect
balance
with
delicate
bread
grains
perfect
body
and
lively
carbonation
very
refreshing
a
treat
to
drink
very
light
pleasant
taste
i
could
drink
this
all
summer
if
it
ever
gets
here
im
rating
this
on
style
and
this
is
on
par
with
german
helles
lagers
rjt
overy
clean
crisp
and
malty
beer
epic
session
beer
what
starts
light
arid
and
creamy
will
quickly
finish
with
a
bonedry
crisp
and
clean
taste
and
texture
that
highlights
a
firm
hop
balance
with
the
vastly
exit
of
any
malt
influence
now
timing
mine
was
bottled
a
few
weeks
ago
its
fricking
cold
id
welcome
it
two
months
later
when
im
actually
starting
to
think
about
spring
let
along
summer
great
springsummer
beer
refreshing
hopefully
these
will
be
around
for
a
while
because
id
like
to
have
some
when
it
is
warm
outside
and
right
now
it
is
skiing
season
in
western
new
york
i
like
this
one
its
very
good
o
a
decent
lager
id
buy
again
when
in
the
helles
mood
this
would
be
an
amazing
beer
to
get
someone
into
the
craft
movement
or
just
sip
on
a
better
beer
then
your
typical
old
swig
while
its
not
over
the
top
it
does
a
great
job
at
being
light
and
bright
like
a
helles
lager
should
be
and
stays
true
to
itself
overall
its
not
bad
but
its
not
great
especially
when
compared
with
spaten
and
some
of
the
other
fine
munich
helles
lagers
of
germany
maybe
worth
a
try
if
you
like
some
substantial
sweetness
otherwise
probably
a
pass
it
is
a
solid
choice
for
a
gift
especially
for
someone
who
isnt
into
craft
will
not
satisfy
beer
nerds
at
all
so
keep
that
in
mind
if
your
a
snob
in
any
regard
although
germany
can
still
be
divided
into
neomedieval
states
germans
everywhere
take
their
beer
very
seriously
every
part
of
the
country
has
in
common
its
recognition
of
brewing
as
cultural
heritage
henninger
is
no
national
treasure
but
for
something
so
industrialized
and
massproduced
its
relative
quality
is
a
clear
nod
to
the
nations
proud
history
of
clean
serviceable
lagers
i
really
wouldnt
recommend
this
as
its
highly
forgettable
and
really
just
nothing
special
there
are
tastier
lagers
out
there
for
at
least
a
similar
price
a
big
thanks
to
the
creator
of
the
canquest
woodychandler
for
this
beer
poured
from
a
16
oz
can
has
a
golden
color
with
a
1
inch
head
smell
is
full
of
malts
a
bit
sweet
taste
is
the
same
malty
some
sweetness
smooth
and
refreshing
feels
light
in
the
mouth
and
overall
is
a
refreshing
and
highly
sessionable
beer
final
grade

a
c
henninger
premium
lager
is
far
from
the
worst
imported
lager
ive
ever
had
but
at
the
same
time
i
can
think
of
plenty
of
others
that
id
rather
be
drinking
this
is
a
fairly
forgettable
industrialstyle
pale
lager
whose
strongest
feature
happens
to
be
the
price
rather
than
anything
relating
to
the
product
itself
this
is
only
2
bucks
a
can
and
i
challenge
you
to
find
a
better
beer
at
that
price
point
in
ontario
if
this
beer
were
more
widelydistributed
id
probably
continue
to
pick
it
up
once
in
a
while
the
top
was
of
an
older
variety
so
the
crack
was
not
as
loud
as
in
many
instances
it
was
a
pint
can
so
the
inverted
glug
did
not
last
long
i
got
twoplus
fingers
of
fizzy
foamy
bonewhite
head
with
moderate
retention
it
created
some
nice
lacing
on
its
way
down
however
color
was
a
slightly
cloudy
yellowgold
srm
4
5
nose
had
the
typical
lager
honeylike
sweetness
and
a
mild
cereallike
graininess
mouthfeel
was
thintomedium
i
would
have
sworn
that
i
was
drinking
heineken
i
actually
do
not
mind
heineken
but
this
really
tasted
like
it
and
at
a
reduced
price
point
finish
was
semisweet
very
lagerlike
and
a
pleasant
break
from
that
minhas
crap
from
earlier
o
on
par
for
a
european
lager
perhaps
but
nothing
special
i
must
apologize
for
initially
lumping
this
in
with
all
the
other
germanmade
lagers
available
around
here
this
is
obviously
a
subpar
example
of
a
generic
lager
let
alone
the
style
it
is
listed
as
on
ba
for
a
brewing
nation
with
such
stringent
standards
its
always
a
bit
of
a
shock
to
come
across
one
of
the
black
sheep
in
that
particular
family
overall
a
perfectly
acceptable
middleorder
lager
beer
i
do
like
a
german
lager
second
only
to
our
best
in
oz
of
course
a
good
one
to
sit
back
listen
to
gordon
lightfoot
and
chill
hypothetically
speaking
a
good
price
for
a
decent
lager
ill
have
it
again
some
beers
you
buy
because
they
are
great
or
outstanding
and
others
because
they
represent
a
great
value
in
an
everyday
brew
henningers
lager
in
the
pint
cans
is
the
latter
of
those
two
the
local
liquor
barn
chain
store
had
the
sixpacks
of
pints
for
6
i
divide
beer
into
everyday
brews
and
weekend
specials
if
you
look
at
the
price
its
about
like
paying
4
50
for
a
six
of
something
else
which
puts
you
in
budweiser
range
around
here
maybe
even
natty
light
land
would
i
rather
drink
this
oh
hell
yeah
is
it
my
favorite
no
but
at
this
price
im
perfectly
happy
given
most
of
the
things
i
really
like
are
in
the
915
range
or
more
in
the
end
we
pick
beers
because
we
really
like
them
and
avoid
ones
we
think
arent
worth
the
money
8
hmmm
maybe
maybe
not
6
for
six
pints
of
good
not
great
german
brew
thats
a
helluva
buy
to
me
o
feels
overly
manufactured
which
it
is
terrible
represenation
of
a
munich
helles
missing
the
grassiness
straw
and
biscuit
aspects
of
a
good
german
light
lager
poor
the
verdict
meh
this
tastes
like
germanys
answer
to
bud
light
drinkable
but
forgettable
d
okay
so
this
came
in
a
preselected
box
from
world
market
titled
worlds
best
beers
or
something
like
that
my
friends
dad
picked
it
up
in
ohio
i
could
tell
by
one
glance
that
most
would
be
relatively
flavorless
pale
lagers
he
offered
i
take
one
so
i
chose
this
one
it
wasnt
nearly
as
good
as
i
was
expecting
mediumlight
body
with
mediumlight
carbonation
slippery
feel
lower

has
tastes

its

and
wouldnt

it
thats
for
sure
cheers

its
ok
but
its
nothing
id
seek
out
again
t
eh
not
too
great
lots
of
grain
and
some
faint
malt
and
grassy
hop
flavor
not
what
i
was
hoping
for
food
match
something
light
on
the
budget
i
mean
dont
go
out
of
your
way
for
mr
henninger
when
hes
making
you
a
beer
that
tastes
as
cheap
as
this
fast
food
two
words
that
conjure
up
a
multitude
of
awful
possibilities
decent
mouthfeel
and
the
carbonation
is
good
definitely
not
the
worst
beer
but
it
does
not
have
much
going
for
it
either
if
you
are
in
jordan
and
looking
for
cheep
beer
get
an
amstel
this
beer
is
average
in
an
industrial
low
flavor
way
that
doesnt
live
up
to
its
category
here
on
ba
rating
these
begs
many
questions
about
reviewing
to
style
personal
taste
is
there
a
time
and
place
on
and
on
this
is
still
beer
but
does
this
beer
respect
beer
o
not
bad
this
was
certainly
an
enjoyable
beer
it
doesnt
offer
an
awful
lot
but
you
know
exactly
what
youre
getting
when
you
pick
this
up
pours
a
clear
yellow
color
with
a
1
inch
white
head
that
fades
to
nothing
small
broken
rings
of
lace
form
and
then
disappear
on
the
drink
down
smell
is
of
sweet
grain
some
grass
notes
and
slight
honey
aromas
taste
is
of
the
sweet
grain
corn
flakes
and
honey
with
a
grassy
herbal
flavor
on
the
finish
mild
bitterness
on
the
palate
after
each
sip
quickly
fades
this
beer
has
a
good
level
of
carbonation
with
a
crisp
and
clean
mouthfeel
overall
this
is
a
pretty
good
easy
drinking
lager
that
is
super
cheap
1
for
a
pintsized
can
at
trader
joes
final
thought
below
5
abv
and
around
5
a
sixer
this
beer
is
pretty
good
and
works
well
on
hot
summer
days
for
a
refreshing
nonwater
drink
o
extremely
sessionable
a
pleasant
surprise
give
it
a
try
on
a
sunny
afternoon
o
a
decent
drinkable
helles
from
a
pint
can
pours
a
bright
gold
color
with
about
one
finger
of
head
that
dissolves
somewhat
quickly
smells
like
sweet
apricots
and
apples
the
flavor
is
more
akin
to
bitter
fruit
with
some
grassy
notes
and
crisp
sweetness
also
present
texture
and
drinkability
are
both
average
but
combined
with
the
pleasing
odor
and
taste
of
henninger
premium
make
up
a
worthy
lager
d
overall
henninger
lager
is
a
pretty
average
lager
not
something
i
would
buy
again
d
youll
have
to
try
lots
of
beers
to
separate
the
nice
ones
from
the
weaker
this
is
the
latter
whats
premium
about
this
watery
beer
yet
another
rather
anonymous
lager
d
surprisingly
good
considering
its
score
perhaps
the
can
helped
a
good
selection
on
the
cheap
it
has
a
great
gold
colored
body
with
a
fluffy
and
rocky
white
head
it
has
a
typical
pils
grass
and
grain
aroma
the
head
has
a
lot
of
staying
power
that
moves
with
the
beer
it
has
grassy
sort
of
cheap
wine
taste
i
now
the
germans
have
the
purity
laws
but
this
beer
tastes
adjunct
to
me
there
is
some
sour
and
bitter
tastes
the
body
is
thin
with
a
lot
of
carbonation
it
isnt
that
bad
of
a
beer
but
it
cant
compete
with
a
true
bavarian
helles
as
a
cheap
coles
liquorland
option
this
is
a
far
better
choice
than
any
of
the
australian
macros
that
rub
shoulders
with
it
in
the
display
fridge
this
is
pretty
highly
carbed
and
comes
off
pretty
watery
the
flavor
is
bland
with
just
a
little
sweetness
overall
a
pretty
weak
version
of
the
style
one
that
i
dont
need
to
have
again
d
its
a
pretty
easy
drinker
and
quite
cheap
with
still
relatively
few
options
in
the
can
it
makes
for
a
nice
beach
golf
etc
type
of
beer
kind
of
no
frills
but
it
beats
out
a
lot
of
the
adjunct
lager
counterparts
overall
a
cheap
drinkable
beer
i
dig
the
cans
and
i
dig
the
pint
size
might
buy
this
again
if
the
mood
hits
me
a
green
bottled
german
lager
the
follows
the
german
purity
law
here
goes
pours
a
sudsy
yellowish
very
bubbly
smell
lagery
with
some
hop
spice
and
cooked
corn
taste
is
bland
but
fades
in
and
out
with
hopiness
very
bubbly
but
then
a
kick
of
cereal
grain
in
the
finish
side
note
this
beer
gave
me
a
head
ache
in
the
morning
and
i
only
drank
two
not
very
pure
hmmm
d
pretty
good
interesting
beer
not
bad
by
any
means
but
different
you
dont
find
a
lot
of
american
beers
tasting
like
this
decent
beer
and
i
may
buy
it
again
if
im
doing
some
sort
of
german
thing
overall
not
worth
buying
only
marginally
better
than
bmc
drinkability
not
complex
but
just
flavorful
enough
to
make
it
decent
drinking
a
middle
of
the
road
lager
one
might
say
its
an
industrialstyle
lager
massproduced
and
processed
not
half
bad
though
dont
expect
much
an
easy
drinking
nobrainer
beer
from
an
impressively
designed
16
ounce
can
pours
a
clear
gold
with
a
thin
shortlived
white
head
smells
honey
and
light
grains
has
a
grassy
bitterness
nice
crispness
and
dry
finish
that
is
very
refreshing
works
well
for
warm
weather
or
as
a
session
starter
this
one
isnt
exceptionally
complex
but
just
enough
with
a
good
balance
pours
a
macro
like
pale
yellow
but
that
is
as
far
as
the
comparisons
go
has
a
large
white
head
that
has
good
retention
moderate
amount
of
spotty
lacing
is
left
on
the
glass
has
a
spicy
hop
and
cracker
like
malt
aroma
but
overall
it
is
a
bit
timid
the
flavor
is
a
little
weak
but
does
have
a
solid
peppery
earthy
hop
flavor
the
malt
is
extremely
dry
and
finishes
moderately
bitter
light
body
and
nicely
carbonated
bordering
on
being
watery
i
found
this
a
very
nice
session
type
beer
the
noble
hops
are
nicely
displayed
as
well
d
pretty
average
i
have
a
feeling
that
this
is
the
german
equivalent
of
labatt
an
underwhelming
lager
with
a
characteristic
off
flavor
in
this
case
a
sort
of
mealy
leafy
bitterness
actually
a
lot
like
labatt
in
that
regard
as
well
not
impressed
at
least
it
was
cheap
mouthfeel
was
medium
in
body
with
a
bit
of
zingprickle
in
the
higher
carbonation
pours
a
clear
golden
color
12
inch
head
of
a
white
color
good
retention
and
good
lacing
smells
of
earthy
malts
slight
hops
and
yeast
cleanliness
fits
the
style
of
a
munich
style
lager
mouth
feel
is
smooth
and
crisp
with
a
high
carbonation
level
tastes
of
earthy
malts
up
front
then
the
yeast
cleanliness
and
the
finish
is
mostly
hops
that
makes
it
a
very
smooth
beer
not
my
favorite
style
by
any
means
but
not
bad
and
a
good
session
beer
appearance
pours
a
clear
gold
with
big
sudsy
white
head
decent
retention
and
big
clumps
of
lacing
smell
funky
grain
slight
skunklike
weird
off
smell
taste
grainy
a
little
husk
vague
spicy
hops
light
bodied
and
slightly
bready
not
particularly
good
the
green
bottle
definitely
didnt
help
drinkability
for
about
7
for
6
pint
cans
its
a
decent
nothinking
brew
especially
for
barbeque
or
feasting
on
notsofine
food
i
was
told
by
a
friend
that
this
is
decent
stuff
and
its
no
drain
pour
but
for
me
i
wouldnt
buy
it
again
i
dont
think
a
rare
style
for
me
but
not
one
im
looking
to
revisit
rather
unexciting
d
one
and
done
with
this
beer
its
possible
that
it
did
not
travel
well
bit
of
euro
skunk
mixed
with
a
malt
background
in
the
aroma
and
then
the
quaff
adds
a
note
of
fruity
esters
and
light
spices
with
that
smooth
malty
backbone
darn
tasty
brew
dont
know
why
a
beer
has
to
be
big
alcohol
or
heavy
taste
to
rate
well
poured
into
a
pint
glass
pale
gold
color
with
a
decent
white
head
and
some
filmy
lacing
aroma
is
malty
with
some
dry
cat
food
notes
some
grain
but
pretty
awful
overall
flavor
is
at
least
inoffensive
light
sweet
malts
mild
noble
hops
and
a
metallic
finish
thin
body
and
high
carbonation
pretty
drinkable
just
plug
your
nose
o
very
sessionable
a
large
step
above
macro
offerings
in
essence
its
heiniken
but
better
the
taste
is
light
sweet
grain
with
light
grassyjuniper
bitterness
hint
of
minerals
a
bit
zesty
with
a
full
grain
and
hay
finish
its
a
bit
thin
and
watery
after
the
first
sip
especially
when
its
cold
and
is
a
bit
bland
compared
to
others
however
when
it
warms
a
bit
the
body
and
flavour
are
better
fuller
and
more
lively
it
has
obvious
similarities
to
better
quality
helles
lagers
like
weihenstephaner
or
paulaner
and
these
are
stronger
when
warmer
but
it
is
clearly
thinner
less
complex
and
more
minerally
it
is
overall
quite
enjoyable
and
the
drinkability
improves
as
it
warms
a
bit
rather
than
going
donwhill
and
becoming
tiresome
its
good
with
food
as
well
drinkability
not
too
bad
could
have
used
a
little
more
carbonation
to
add
some
punch
and
accentuate
the
malt
d
easy
to
drink
true
enough
but
not
very
special
light
body
with
adequate
carbonation
easy
to
drink
nothing
special
but
pleasing
this
seems
like
a
very
basic
german
lager
but
the
more
often
i
have
one
of
these
the
more
i
like
it
i
think
simplicity
is
the
key
to
this
beer
mild
aroma
no
skunky
scents
this
beer
is
nice
to
look
at
pours
a
vibrant
light
gold
color
with
thin
headno
lacing
and
moderate
carbonation
the
mouthfeel
is
the
biggest
surprise
to
this
one
sip
after
sip
this
beer
is
creamy
and
full
an
unexpected
thickness
accompanies
this
lager
as
i
swallow
it
flavor
is
mild
and
smooth
with
no
surprises
other
than
the
fact
that
it
tastes
really
good
wonderful
mass
produced
german
lager
i
could
drink
this
anytime
pour
a
clear
yellow
with
some
light
tea
overtones
barely
there
head
but
some
decent
the
taste
is
a
light
lemon
grass
with
maybe
a
light
baking
flour
and
some
adjuncts
pretty
light
palate
with
a
musty
aftertaste
refreshing
but
would
be
more
so
if
the
finish
wasnt
so
musty
d
ok
but
boring
metallic
and
vegetable
flavors
detract
from
the
experience
i
have
had
some
great
german
beers
lagers
even
but
to
claim
that
this
is
german
brewing
tradition
the
caption
on
the
label
reads
that
like
mcdonalds
selling
a
burger
as
an
american
grilling
tradition

12
oz

chill
hazed
golden
body
with
a
small

that
flls
into

decent

is
skunky
some
floral

yeast
underneath
light
medium

with
crisp

taste
has
some
crackery
malt
sweetness
and
faint

but
its
skunky
green
bottle
should
be
a
warning
d
very
easy
drinking
beer
id
gladly
drink
one
if
offered
but
there
are
other
beers
id
prefer
d
easy
to
drink
and
not
terrible
but
there
are
lot
of
beers
that
i
would
pick
ahead
of
this
one
d
excellent
this
screams
drinkability
on
a
brisk
spring
day
like
today
this
has
enough
interesting
flavors
to
keep
your
palate
guessing
but
its
crisp
fresh
and
lively
enough
to
avoid
overtaxing
your
tongue
poured
a
golden
hue
with
slight
head
good
carbonation
with
slightly
chunky
head
after
a
few
minutes
not
much
there
on
the
smell
that
i
can
tell
except
maybe
some
yeast
and
light
malts
taste
is
somewhat
bitter
with
a
little
more
than
light
mouth
feel
not
that
great
in
my
opinion
but
drinkablilty
is
there
because
of
the
lower
abv
d
average
and
yet
completely
forgettable
nothing
really
bad
about
this
brew
but
absolutely
nothing
stands
out
about
it
either
if
someone
offers
you
one
dont
turn
it
down
but
on
the
other
hand
i
wouldnt
seek
this
one
out
light
yellow
pour
with
huge

is
light

taste
is
weak
lightly
carbonated

barely
drinkable

never

very
easy
drinking

nothing
outstanding

its

is

its
not
very
good
wouldnt
go
out
of
my
way
for
it
pass
this
up
unless
its
free
and
youre
very
very
thirsty
overall
not
a
beer
id
drink
again
which
is
a
shame
as
the
appearance
had
my
hopes
up
so
high
sampled
at
the
odds
and
ends
tasting
ii
on
101907
this
beer
is
a
clear
rather
ugly
yellow
color
with
a
minimal
white
head
that
dissipates
rapidly
spotty
lacing
light
malt
and
corn
aroma
thin
body
with
weak
malt
and
hops
flavor
with
the
finish
is
short
and
mildly
hoppy
drinkable
yet
not
something
i
would
bother
with
again
d
over
all
it
was
drinkable
would
not
refuse
it
if
it
was
given
to
me
but
not
a
bad
beer
to
pound
down
this
beer
pours
a
clear
pale
straw
color
the
head
is
large
creamy
and
bright
white
the
aroma
is
of
um
air
seriously
there
is
no
aroma
the
taste
is
has
a
hint
bready
malt
and
enough
noble
hops
to
make
things
mildly
interesting
the
mouthfeel
is
light
bodied
and
a
high
but
not
too
high
level
of
carbonation
overall
this
is
an
all
right
beer
if
it
had
an
aroma
i
might
drink
it
again
however
as
it
is
i
cannot
see
myself
drinking
this
in
the
future
d
this
is
pretty
easy
to
drink
but
doesnt
bring
anything
interesting
to
the
table
so
i
could
see
it
getting
boring
pretty
fast
notes
not
much
to
shout
out
about
there
just
a
boring
helles
lager
might
be
a
good
starter
kit
for
those
getting
into
the
style
ill
bounce
pass
this
one
next
time
perhaps
this
one
went
bad
it
didnt
taste
skunky

beer
very

the

home
to
henninger
germanys
fifth

brewery
and
their
361
foot
high

silo
is
one
of
the
towns
landmarks
but
frankfurt
isnt
known
for
any
particular
style
of
beer
and
this
smooth
and
undemanding
lager
falls
somewhere
between
a
dortmunderstyle
and
a
lower
alcohol
pilsner
its
clear
golden
body
reveals
fine
bubbles
rising
steadily
towards
its
short
but
creamy
head
of
bright
white
foam
the
retention
is
good
but
it
eventually
erodes
to
a
thin
creamy
collar
yet
its
still
able
to
leave
some
sticky
splashes

the

taste
is
lightly
floral
from
the
slight
hopping
with
some
grainy
sweetness
no
carbonation
is
noted
but
the
mouthfeel
finishes
a
bit
crisp
slight
astringency
is
also
present
similar
to
an
american
macro
beer
but
just
a
tad
more
character
no
skunkiness
noted
despite
the
green
bottle
good
looking
bottle
and
labeling
watered
down
miller
lite
i
cant
believe
this
was
on
the
craft
beer
shelf
got
this
at
the
beach
last
year
at
a
local
craft
beer
seller
took
a
six
pack
on
the
beach
good
drinking
beer
had
a
light
crisp
hop
flavor
at
first
the
malt
smell
and
taste
is
a
little
low
for
me
light
wheat
color
to
it
had
a
thin
head
to
it
alot
better
than
my
go
to
beer
miller
lite
so
it
a
keeper
this
is
a
darned
fine
beer
nice
color
and
aroma
and
very
drinkable
i
found
it
had
a
nice
hoppy
aftertaste
which
i
enjoyed
i
thought
it
was
slightly
flat
which
detracted
from
the
feel
score
im
not
a
huge
fan
of
german
style
beers
but
this
is
one
nicest
ive
tasted
got
this
in
a
sixer
exchange
nice
but
not
memorable
a
very
inoffensive
lager
pleasing
appearance
overall
although
the
lacing
could
have
been
better
honey
yellow
in
color
with
excellent
clarity
poured
with
a
short
bright
white
foam
that
quickly
reduced
to
a
thin
wispy
cap
fresh
grain
biscuit
malt
fresh
grass
and
light
herbal
aromas
medium
bodied
with
a
delicate
lager
feel
up
front
followed
by
sharp
tongue
twisting
tanginess
through
middle
and
a
clean
crisp
dry
finish
bready
biscuity
malt
flavors
throughout
with
herbal
hop
tanginess
through
the
middle
finishes
with
a
biscuity
malt
aftertaste
an
awesome
refreshing
easydrinking
malty
german
lager
round
and
grainy
a
very
good
example
of
the
style
on
the
thin
side
as
it
should
be
but
it
has
ample
carbonation
making
this
very
spritzy
grainy
finish
with
a
whiff
of
hop
pepper
short
grassy
aftertaste
overall
a
fantastic
helles
that
is
easy
to
drink
and
a
true
representation
of
the
style
there
is
a
lot
to
be
said
for
low
alcohol
but
high
taste
solid
drinkable
beers
and
this
one
falls
squarely
in
that
category
a
fantastic
helles
that
should
be
rated
as
one
of
the
best
it
the
category
overall
a
solid
lager
from
pa
it
would
be
a
good
introductory
beer
for
someone
who
has
not
experienced

it
is
as
if
the

is
evaporating
from
the

each

becoming
a
greedy
pull
leaving
you
thirsty
for
more
a
definite
try
if
youve

stoudts

straw

fairly
hearty
for
the

nice

d
i
would
take
a
guess
and
say
something
was
a
little
off
with
this
bottlean
old
bottle
purchased
at
a
wegmans
in
pa
not
far
from
the
brewery
makes
this
a
little
disappointing
notes
such
a
tasty
lager
great
for
anytime
of
year
cheers
overall
good
beer
this
would
be
a
great
beer
on
a
warm
summer
night
on
the
deck
this
beer
and
southampton
keller
pils
will
be
competing
for
the
spot
of
goto
summer
beer
for
me
if
berkshire
brewing
companys
czech
pilsner
came
in
12oz
bottles
it
would
also
be
in
the
running
this
beer
is
crisper
with
a
better
mouthfeel
all
around
while
keller
pils
delivers
more
bold
flavors
i
think
the
bottled
on
date
will
be
the
decider
between
the
two
its
bright
gold
exceptionally
clear
with
a
pearly
white
head
that
refuses
to
quit
the
crystalclarity
makes
lively
carbonation
a
spectacle
the
looping
and
endless
stream
of
mini
bubbles
is
downright
mesmerizing
smell
is
zesty
with
cut
grass
and
theres
honey
in
the
aroma
as
well
taste
some
mild
honey
up
front
followed
by
delicate
bitterness
from
the
hops
mouthfeel
is
lightbodied
slick
crisp
fresh
and
delicious
outstanding
and
subtle
lately
ive
been
appreciating
session
beers
more
and
more
and
actively
sought
this
one
out
because
i
have
been
so
impressed
with
this
brewer
give
me
more
malty
aroma
has
a
strong
yeasty
overtone
it
pours
a
clear
solar
yellow
with
a
rather
average
white
head
crisp
malty
flavor
has
a
grassy
overtone
and
a
firm
yeasty
note
smooth
crisp
texture
has
just
a
little
fizz
enough
so
that
you
know
this
is
beer
just
ok
but
pick
up
a
bottle
if
you
have
a
chance
served
from
tap
into
a
sampler
shaker
poured
an
opaque
pale
golden
yellow
with
a
one
finger
white
head
that
subsided
to
a
half
finger
slowly
maintained
nice
lacing
throughout
the
glass
the
aroma
was
comprised
of
sweet
malt
fruit
banana
and
wheat
the
flavor
was
of
sweet
malt
banana
fruit
and
wheat
it
had
a
light
feel
on
the
palate
with
mild
carbonation
overall
this
was
a
pretty
decent
brew
i
really
wish
the
flavor
and
aroma
on
this
one
would
have
been
a
little
more
complex
while
i
say
this
the
simplicity
of
this
one
is
really
what
made
it
all
of
the
flavors
and
aromas
on
this
one
were
really
crisp
and
refreshing
a
good
easy
drinking
brew
that
you
should
take
the
chance
to
try
yourself
perhaps
i
dont
understand
this
style
and
perhaps
this
taste
and
mouthfeel
are
normal
for
this
style
and
hence
the
hight
ratings
by
some
however
i
have
to
say
that
this
beer
is
not
for
me
even
without
understanding
the
style
i
still
would
say
that
this
brew
is
weak
and
watery
tasting
really
nice
helles
crisp
refreshing
and
mild
nice
every
day
brew
serving
type
bottle
this
brew
is
an
excellent
example
of
a
light
style
of
beer
not
to
be
confused
with
americas
incessant
deference
to
diet
beer
flavor
character
aroma
and
ceaseless
drinkability
is
exemplified
by
this
one
top
notch
this
beer
when
poured
into
a
pint
glass
has
a
nice
straw
yellow
body
with
a
nice
white
creamy
1
head
that
hangs
around
for
a
while
the
smell
is
grains
coming
through
in
the
smell
the
taste
is
a
little
fruity
with
some
grains
coming
through
the
mouth
feel
is
crisp
and
clean
well
carbonated
with
small
bubbles
overall
this
is
a
good
drinkable
lager
overall
a
good
if
just
another
bland
and
boring
lager
certainly
miles
better
than
the
massproduced
bmc
swills
of
the
world
but
those
wanting
more
flavor
and
substance
should
look
elsewhere
victorys
prima
pils
is
a
lot
better
than
this
appearance
is
gold
and
clear
nice
smell
is
none
eventfull
there
is
a
slight
fruity
aroma
mouthfeel
is
clean
and
sits
well
in
the
mouth
this
brew
feels
good
on
the
tongue
taste
smooth
refreshing
lager
with
no
bit
upfront
or
in
the
back
nothing
special
overall
quite
uneventful
but
it
is
refreshing
not
the
best
we
have
had
not
fridge
worthy
lighter
medium
body
decent
carbonation
tingly
and
brisk
on
the
palate
a
refreshing
lager
with
a
pretty
streamlined
flavor
something
id
probably
drink
again
rjt
paired
with
sesame
bbq
chicken
and
twice
baked
potato
with
cheddar
broccoli
and
bacon
nothing
bad
about
this
one
but
nothing
overly
great
either
cheers
overall
do
not
judge
a
book
by
its
cover
or
a
beer
by
its
appearance
while
this
beer
pours
out
looking
horrible
and
smelling
average
the
taste
and
overall
refreshment
factor
makes
it
a
very
nice
beer
o
easy
drinker
crisp
bit
refreshing
not
as
bad
as
i
was
expecting
not
my
favorite
style
but
still
not
bad
overall
i
liked
this
offering
and
kudos
to
being
pa
brewed
light
toasty
with
a
touch
of
hops
and
sweetness
make
a
good
brew
o
easy
drinking
could
relax
with
this
beer
on
a
hot
day
for
sure
would
be
a
good
sessionable
beer
flavor
is
solid
despite
being
a
lighter
beer
drinkability
and
overall
impression
i
have
had
this
beer
several
times
before
and
as
in
the
past
i
found
this
one
quite
drinkable
one
sip
follows
easily
from
the
last
and
invites
the
next
i
could
have
more
than
one
of
this
and
find
it
a
nice
beer
for
an
evening
including
dinner
and
a
good
conversation
with
friends
my
overall
impression
is
that
this
is
a
first
rate
example
of
the
style
and
once
again
stoudts
has
displayed
their
mastery
of
german
style
beers
its
very
drinkable
and
smooth
but
also
isnt
all
that
remarkable
while
the
tasting
notes
surprised
me
for
the
style
they
still
do
taste
good
moreys
bottom
line
if
youre
looking
for
something
on
the
lighter
side
stoudts
gold
might
just
be
your
beer
perfect
for
summer
days
like
this
one
90
degrees
a
good
fall
yard
work
beer
i
think
helles
lagers
arent
my
first
thought
for
a
refreshing
beer
but
stoudts
gold
is
a
great
candidate
to
change
my
mind
overall
i
have
been
looking
forward
to
sampling
this
for
awhile
and
i
am
not
the
least
bit
disappointed
if
not
for
price
and
availability
this
would
be
my
daily
drinker
poured
into
a
beer
mug
it
had
a
hazy
yellow
color
with
a
nice
size
head
it
smelled
of
honey
grain
malt
it
tasted
of
slight
wheat
honey
and
a
lemon
citrus
finish
it
was
a
light
beer
definitely
refreshing
overall
all
i
have
to
say
is
yikes
ba
membersyour
palate
is
really
bad
including
the
bros
there
is
nothing
german
about
this
beer
there
is
nothing
helles
lager
stylish
about
this
beer
spicy
hop
bitterness
is
no
wheres
to
be
found
this
was
a
pretty
good
lager
good
balanced
flavor
but
not
really
anything
that
made
it
stand
out
for
me
o
a
damn
fine
lager
stoudts
is
a
brewery
worth
checking
out
very
solid
brew
one
of
the
best
segue
or
summer
beers
your
likely
to
come
across
buy
with
confidence
best
somewhat
accessible
helles
east
of
the
mississippi
river
it
may
be
very
easy
drinker
clean
simple
and
enjoyable
very
glad
i
got
to
try
this
perfect
for
the
summer
days
but
i
could
definitely
see
myself
grabbing
one
of
these
at
any
time
of
the
year
a
beer
that
could
easily
be
a
staple
in
my
fridge
if
it
were
available
in
my
area
a
go
to
beer
for
me
pours
lager
gold
with
a
good
head
with
a
modest
pour
the
color
is
what
a
golden
beer
should
be
a
bar
setter
smells
grainy
but
smell
does
not
do
this
beer
justice
now
the
taste
by
the
way
i
like
this
very
cold
exceptional
as
rated
i
cant
believe
this
is
brewed
in
penn
tastes
better
than
most
germans
ive
had
this
thing
is
pure
and
delicious
with
sweet
bread
alittle
pepper
and
some
mild
bavarian
bitterness
on
the
finish
carbonated
well
and
sessionable
i
think
it
loses
its
sweetness
as
it
warms
but
i
usually
dont
allow
that
to
happen
simple
and
a
great
american
tribute
poured
a
beautiful
golden
color
that
was
crystal
clear
and
topped
with
an
attractive
white
head
mouth
feel
is
good
very
smooth
aroma
is
not
real
prominent
but
nice
taste
is
slightly
sweet
and
of
toasted
malt
this
is
one
easydrinking
beer
and
one
i
will
definitely
buy
again
and
again
drinkability
is
about
as
high
as
it
gets
excellent
beer
i
really
liked
this
beer
stoudts
being
a
new
brewery
to
enter
louisiana
recently
i
was
excited
to
try
this
a
very
smooth
beer
with
good
carbonation
at
times
i
felt
like
there
was
a
slight
butter
taste
to
the
beer
i
could
easily
drink
this
beer
all
day
the
rest
of
stoudts
lineup
will
definitely
be
on
my
list
when
shopping
around
hands
down
one
of
my
favorite
lagers
from
the
first
bottle
i
love
this
stoudts
nailed
the
style
in
fact
i
dont
know
of
a
better
american
made
version
something
i
would
highly
recommend
the
taste
is
great
a
slight
bready
malt
presence
with
a
mild
hop
taste
crisp
clean
and
highly
drinkable
a
really
great
example
of
what
a
lager
can
be
i
o
easy
drinking
crisp
and
refreshing
summertime
beer
o
this
is
a
prime
example
of
the
style
if
you
need
inyourface
hops
and
boldness
all
the
way
around
skip
it
if
you
want
a
great
craft
lager
good
choice
the
palate
is
medium
bodied
creamy
and
very
delicious
more
of
those
toasty
malt
and
bright
flavors
and
a
very
smooth
and
slightly
sweet
finish
supremely
drinkable
o
this
is
a
beer
that
i
will
drink
over
and
over
again
o
with
all
the
impressive
and
unique
beers
that
exist
in
the
world
of
mircobrews
today
the
classic
types
are
often
ignored
or
sub
par
every
brewery
it
seems
has
a
pale
ale
or
lager
because
it
is
part
of
the
line
up
it
is
tradition
my
point
that
stoudts
golden
lager
shows
how
excellent
the
classic
types
can
be
sure
it
is
amazing
to
have
a
rare
beer
aged
in
oak
for
two
years
with
chocolate
or
roasted
hawaiian
coffee
beans
before
being
blended
with
other
casks
and
then
finally
reaching
the
shelf
in
very
limited
quantities
yes
i
used
a
bit
of
hyperbole
after
all
i
am
one
of
those
people
trying
to
buy
that
interesting
beer
however
it
is
nice
to
buy
something
that
reminds
you
that
beer
does
not
have
to
be
brewed
in
unique
and
sometimes
unnecessary
ways
for
it
to
be
good
we
are
fortunate
to
live
in
a
world
of
beer
were
we
have
both
o
this
pretty
much
hits
the
nail
on
the
head
for
the
style
its
simple

this

picking
up
if
you

i
have
to
give
them
a
thumbs
up
if
nothing
else
for
pursuing
many
different
styles
as
opposed
to
some
breweries
that
while
producing
a
solid
beer
everything
seems
to
taste
quite
the

sorry
rogue
brewery
seems
like
there
is
peach
on

nuts
on

its
smoky
on
the
end
for
sure
like

a

brew
that
you
can
tell
is
definitely
a

brew
you
can
tell
care
has
been
made

this

definitely
worth
trying
very
well
crafted
definitely
a

beer
excellent
offering
from
stoudts
after
having
this
and
their
pils
im
really
impressed
with
this
brewer
thanks
to
myles
at
the
cork
for
recommending
this
gem
i
think
ill
pick
up
a
case
tomorrow
d
a
very
enjoyable
beer
served
cold
it
doesnt
make
you
sit
up
and
take
notice
but
it
quenches
your
thirst
in
a
very
satisfying
way
ive
served
it
at

overall
i
am
disappointed
but
it

i
will
update
this
review
upon
further
tastings
pours
extremely
clear
and
very
bright
with
little
head
the
aroma
is
scratchy
with
earthy
german
style
hops
laid
over
a
slightly
sweet
light
malt
note
on
the
palate
hop
bitterness
up
front
turns
into
a
big
bready
midpalate
with
the
beer
finishing
up
on
an
acidic
hop
note
nothing
too
forward
though
mouthfeel
is
smooth
overall
with
a
bit
of
hop
roughness
and
well
balanced
carbonation
overall
this
is
quite
a
nice
helles
not
as
good
as
some
of
the
best
american
ones
not
to
mention
germans
but
good
drinkability
not
bad
for
a
soft
sweet
lager
i
can
recall
stopping
at
the
brewery
in
1997
and
purchasing
a
case
of
six
26
ounce
bottles
of
this
brew
unpasterized
what
a
joy
to
drink
i
would
very
much
like
other
brewers
to
attempt
to
brew
this
style
of
beer
it
is
an
excellent
everyday
beer
with
subtle
complexities
drinkability
is
very
good
a
very
nice
easy
drinking
and
tasty
lager
pours
a
clean
golden
color
with
a
white
head
that
does
not
last
aromas
of
a
european
hp
and
a
sweet
malt
tastes
about
the
same
with
with
a
dry
end
not
much
of
an
aftertaste
but
a
good
palate
clensor
easy
to
drink
good
for
a
game
light
and
refreshing
brewing
a

lager
like
this
consistently
and
in

enough
quantities
to

talk

about

that
rivals
the
best

for

and
exceeds
them

will
make
this

all

d
this
is
an
excellent
beer
one
that
i
have
been
a
fan
of
since
i
first
visited
the
brewery
in
1999
pours
a
pale
golden
color
with
a
nice
big
foamy
white
head
and
a
moderate
amount
of
carbonation
smell
is
hoppy

with

flavors
easy

and
very
satisfying
had
this
really
cold
drank
it
quickly
looked
for
another
this
would
be
a
fantastic
summer
lawnmower
beer
or
any
other
time
this
makes
me
actually
appreciate
yellow
beers
when
they
are
done
to
standard
good
stuff
another
pa
beverage
to
look
for
final
thought
this
is
a
very
well
done
helles
that
comes
as
close
as
they
brew
in
bavaria
and
this
means
a
lot
because
i
lived
there
for
six
months
cheers
this
would
be
a
fantastic
beer
to
always
have
a
few
of
in
the
fridge
great
drinkin
for
when
you
just
want
a
beer
d
everything
about
this
beer
makes
me
want
to
drink
another
one
i
want
to
go
get
a
case
of
it
now
go
out
and
get
some
of
this
if
you
like
lagers
drinkability
really
great
flavor
and
complexity
keeps
one
coming
back
i
could
drink
these
all
night
and
be
in
bliss
liquid
contentment
im
very
impressed
drinkability
as
good
as
you
can
get
a
simple
and
refreshing
brew
that
can
be
quaffed
all
day
still
this
is
what
its
supposed
to
be
a
clean
tasting
easy
drinkin
beer
taste
is
sweet
but
perfectly
so
not
overdone
and
nothing
more
is
needed
its
well
balanced
with
a
silky
smooth
finish
very
creamy
and
light
in
body
crisp
and
clean
a
very
good
lager
with
light
carbonation
this
is
delicious
and
goes
down
so
easy
might
make
this
my
new
session
beer
overall
a
very
good
lager
drinkable
all
day
overall
a
lager
that
gets
my
thumbs
up
i
dont
like
the
metallic
twang
in
the
back
end
of
this
beer
but
otherwise
its
a
respectable
lager
poured
a
pale
golden
color
with
longlasting
white
puffy
head
smell
is
mainly
of
sweetich
hops
taste
is
loaded
with
malt
delivering
a
nice
crispiness
combined
with
a
citrus
background
finish
is
smooth
refreshing
and
crisp
slight
sweetness
with
is
very
enjoyable
i
am
not
a
big
fan
of
lagers
but
this
a
very
good
one
a
well
made
lager
pours
out
to
a
bright
golden
yellow
color
with
a
well
formed
and
bubbly
12
inch
head
with
some
notes
of
lace
in
the
glass
medium
level
of
carbonation
aromas
of
sweet
aromatic
malts
was
nice
but
very
weak
taste
was
solid
flavors
of
soda
crackers
malt
and
grains
was
very
satisfying
some
sourness
toward
the
finish
mouthfeel
was
medium
to
medium
light
bodied
with
some
zestyness
toward
the
finish
drinkability
is
good
ive
become
kind
of
disillusioned
with
micro
lagers
as
some
have
become
very
redundant
and
boring
but
this
one
is
a
nice
change
up
id
like
to
have
on
hand
recommended
notes
just
average
brew
drinkability
is
not
bad
a
good
change
of
pace
from
the
norm
lager
i
like
their
pils
better
its
drier
and
hoppier
but
this
one
is
right
on
style
as
far
as
i
can
tell
drinking
beers
like
this
fresh
also
makes
a
big
difference
for
a
munich
helles
this
is
pretty
damn
good
im
not
usually
impressed
with
stoudts
brews
but
this
is
an
exception
well
done

after
the
first
i
wanted
another
would
complement
countless
dishes
the
flavour
is
a
mash
of
grass
sweetnesssome
floral
notes
and
general
maltiness
hop
flavouring
interacts
wit
hthe
malt
base
quite
nicely
mouthfeel
is
full
and
thick
spot
on
for
this
brew
this
one
is
basic
but
has
some
flavour
packed
in
and
is
worth
a
try
itd
work
well
to
bridge
the
gap
for
macro
drinkers
as
well
despite
being
one
of
my
least
favorite
styles
this
is
drinkable
and
even
pleasant
maybe
not
a
lager
i
would
choose
over
a
bock
etc
but
pleasant
tasting
for
the
style
12

cant

im
thrilled
about
that
the

still
it

head
that
took
a
while
to
settle
down
smell
consisted
of
earthy
tones
and
some
floralherbal
profile
hops
and
malts
mix
in
with
each
other
with
a
touch
of
honey
taste
was
pretty
good
it
has
a
nice
crispiness
to
it
a
nice
dose
of
malts
hit
the
palate
with
some
herbal
hops
underlying
the
malts
and
finishes
a
tad
on
the
sweet
side
it
has
a
medium
body
to
it
but
i
could
drink
these
all
night
just
went
down
so
easy
and
fast
low
carbonation
makes
for
high
drinkability
in
this
regard
it
almost
seemed
weak
yet
seemed
to
hold
up
excellent
flavor
good
beer
to
have
just
about
anytime
pours
with
a
white
twofingered
head
that
fades
to
clumps
and
leaves
a
lot
lace
light
clear

color
light
carbonation
and
light

mixed
with
some

for
a
12oz

from
colonial
spirits
acton
ma
stoudts
gold
lager
is
a
pleasant
surprise
and
is
more
than
solid
in
all
respects
i
havent
had
too
many
good
nongerman
munich
helles
lagers
but
this
one
is
a
winner
my
friend
brought
over
a
six
pack
of
this
and
raved
about
it
cool
label
pours
out
golden
yellow
in
color
with
a
small
white
head
the
smell
is
a
subtle
malt
with
sweetness
coming
through
medium
to
low
carbonation
but
it
feels
just
about
right
not
a
ton
of
flavor
but
very
refreshing
and
easy
to
drink
i
pick
up
some
fruityness
in
the
beginning
and
then
a
quick
hop
sharpness
hits
you
as
fast
as
it
comes
it
leaves
overall
a
solid
lager
that
i
will
try
again
summary
when
you
buy
a
sampler
case
from
a
brewery
there
is
always
that
one
beer
that
you
feel
like
they
are
trying
to
get
rid
of
by
putting
it
in
with
other
better
beers
this
is
that
lesser
beer
taste
a
little
spice
on
the
front
some
of
that
raw
honeysuckle
following
to
the
finish
slightly
hazy
deep
golden
color
thin
ivory
white
head
soon
there
is
just
the
slightest
of
a
collar
left
nice
earthy
and
herbal
and
sweet
aroma
a
little
hay
and
hops
mixed
in
too
the
carbonation
is
nice
and
prickly
body
is
a
little
better
than
medium
taste
is
malty
and
a
little
sweet
like
molasses
and
accented
nicely
by
german
hoppiness
this
is
pretty
good
drinkability
im
going
to
get
a
few
more
of
these
not
just
cause
its
a
pa
brew
but
because
this
is
one
tasty
beer
very
nicely
done
im
going
to
be
sad
when
this
glass
is
empty
this
light
lager
realizes
its
basic
composition
of
malt
and
hops
more
obviously
than
some
its
very
clean
refreshing
and
as
drinkable
as
any
beer
without
forgetting
to
be
flavorful
nice
job
stoudts
this
brew
pours
a
bright
golden
color
with
an
orange
tinge
to
it
very
thin
white
head
and
little
lacing
the
aroma
is
mostly
hops
with
a
touch
of
fruit
and
wheat
crisp
body
with
malt
flavor
at
the
forefront
the
rest
of
the
flavor
was
reminiscent
of
your
standard
bland
lager
as
was
the
finish
which
was
mildly
hoppy
this
is
a
drinkable
beer
but
really
not
that
special
the
beer
pours
a
hazy
golden
color
with
a
lacey
white
head
the
aroma
is
sweet
and
fruity
it
has
banana
smells
with
light
crystal
malts
the
taste
is
good
it
has
a
slightly
malty
flavor
with
a
real
golden
taste
its
clean
and
fruity
the
mouthfeel
is
good
its
a
lowmedium
bodied
beer
with
adequate
carbonation
this
is
a
decent
lager
but
not
great
i
think
ill
have
another
this
lager
poured
a
clear
golden
color
with
white
foam
that
settled
but
left
some
lace
on
the
glass
the
smell
was
subdued
malt
the
taste
was
dominated
by
floral
hops
but
with
malt
bread
and
yeast
present
the
hop
bitterness
came
through
in
finish
the
mouthfeel
was
smooth
and
creamy
with
medium
body
and
modest
carbonation
the
floral
hops
flavors
lingered
nicely
as
an
aftertaste
this
was
a
good
german
style
helles
lager
well
after
one
sip
my
initital
thought
was
this
beer
is
like
eating
a
bowl
of
cereal
totally
grainy
taste
medium
yellow
in
color
with
a
slight
head
smell
was
fresh
but
very
reminiscent
of
a
grain
mill
i
used
to
live
on
a
farm
it
was
reminded
me
of
the
smell
of
grain
taste
is
also
reminiscent
of
refined
grain
with
some
hop
bitterness
in
the
finish
would
not
have
again
pat
f
poured
a
nice
golden
color
with
a
light
rocky
head
that
left
a
little
lacingthe
aroma
was
very
mild
with
some
nice
malty
tones
being
dominat
taste
was
nice
and
softly
malty
with
a
pretty
good
little
hopsmack
to
finish
real
easy
to
drink
a
good
summer
brew
exellent
brew
wish
i
had
more
this
is
very
nice
a
great
tasting
brew
from
stoudts
it
pour
a
clear
golden
color
topped
of
by
a
thick
froth
which
fades
away
slowly
leaving
a
sticky
weblike
lave
on
the
glass
the
aroma
is
slightly
sweet
from
the
malt
with
mild
hop
undertones
the
taste
is
also
sweet
and
slightly
bitter
finishing
off
with
a
mild
pepper
spiciness
this
is
a
very
well
balanced
brew
not
too
bitter
not
too
sweet
i
will
definitely
seek
this
one
out
again
a
very
clear
golden
lager
with
a
small
white
head
and
minimal
lacing
very
nice
full
nose
of
malt
the
taste
is
very
even
and
clean
full
of
malt
and
grain
with
enough
bitttering
hops
to
balance
everything
out
the
feel
is
smooth
and
creamy
with
a
strong
crispness
in
the
finish
this
went
down
very
well
and
it
would
have
been
easy
to
order
up
more
a
very
nice
lager
indeed
a
real
nice
helles
pours
a
somewhat
cloudy
gold
with
a
bit
of
a
reddish
hue
nice
maltiness
emerges
on
the
nose
and
invites
you
in
taste
starts
with
the
malt
but
then
a
real
nice
snappy
hop
presence
closes
the
deal
this
is
sweet
and
malty
but
finishes
crisp
and
clean
i
like
dortmunder
gold
better
but
this
is
a
nice
helles
in
the
next
tier
a
nice
crisp
drinking
lager
that
has
a
great
german
feel
to
it
well
balanced
with
good
malt
backround
and
a
very
nice
hop
balance
excellent
session
beer
this
one
could
really
be
a
great
summer
work
brew
but
it
is
a
bit
hard
to
come
by
in
my
area
nothing
amazing
here
but
a
good
one
none
the
less
this
beer
pours
a
crystal
clear
burst
of
sunshine
gold
with
a
fluffy
white
head
leaving
a
trickled
lace
aroma
is
full
of
delicate
german
hops
are
paired
with
a
crisp
sweet
two
pale
malted
barely
taste
is
a
crisp
smooth
sweet
rolling
malt
profile
that
is
mellowed
by
a
nice
bitterness
very
nicely
done
crisp
lager
can
be
compared
to
other
great
german
lagers
awesome
summer
beer
one
could
easily
go
through
a
case
of
this
brew
mouthfeel
contains
a
tingling
sensation
that
runs
through
to
the
back
of
the
throat
with
a
lighter
body
this
beer
is
one
solid
session
brew
drinkability
can
be
explained
as
the
most
simplistic
yet
most
amazing
chalk
full
of
goodness
this
beer
is
one
that
just
keeps
coming
back
to
you
this
beer
poured
a
yellow
gold
color
that
had
a
slight
cloud
to
it
you
could
still
see
the
carbonation
bubbles
if
you
held
it
to
the
light
the
head
that
it
produced
was
a
creamybeige
colored
that
was
good
in
size
foamy
and
creamy
in
nature
and
it
seemed
to
last
for
quite
some
time
it
left
a
sheet
with
rings
at
the
end
lace
behind
a
good
portion
of
the
way
down
the
glass
and
then
broke
off
into
a
patchy
lace
the
aromas
that
came
from
the
glass
were
sweet
and
spicy
like
a
peppercorn
i
nosed
fresh
hops
sweet
malts
citrus
fruit
peppercorns
fresh
grass
and
some
caramel
the
tastes
were
much
like
the
aromas
flavors
of
fresh
floral
hops
sweet
malt
a
light
pepper
citrus
lemons
kind
of
a
watery
presence
fresh
grass
caramel
and
a
tad
alcohol
the
aftertaste
was
a
mix
of
hops
and
a
fresh
clean
water
feeling
that
balanced
the
hop
right
out
medium
bodied
stoudts
did
a
good
job
in
balancing
the
hop
bite
with
the
sweet
malt
imo
the
two
flavors
complimented
each
other
and
did
not
overpower
one
another
it
is
a
refreshing
beer
that
is
clean
and
crisp
not
a
super
beer
but
very
good
to
drink
sharp
malty
nose
gold
colored
with
lots
of
tiny
bubbles
nice
fluffy
white
head
smooth
solid
mouth
especially
for
a
lager
quite
an
even
handed
malty
earthy
taste
slight
marshmello
sweetness
to
the
finish
a
very
good
lager
the
beer
is
solid
and
well
crafted
a
great
lager
for
the
fall
months
malty
smooth
and
good
lookin
it
wont
knock
your
socks
off
but
it
will
give
ya
a
smile
this
was
a
beer
12oz
contract
brewed
at
frederick
ive
had
a
few
stoudts
beers
but
i
realize
now
they
have
all
been
from
12
oz
bottles
and
ive
never
tasted
anything
in
the
bigger
bottles
actually
made
at
stoudts
nevertheless
i
love
their
beers
and
think
they
are
worthy
of
more
attention
this
beer
is
no
exception
a
crisp
malty
clean
quenching
lager
that
is
a
perfect
american
representation
of
a
german
style
beer
lovely
head
that
wisps
into
clouds
appealing
musty
aroma
full
rich
maltiness
right
off
the
bat
then
tempered
by
flavorsome
not
too
bitter
hops
this
beer
will
do
for
any
occasion
and
you
might
be
able
to
get
that
budlightswilling
friend
of
yours
to
drink
a
few
of
these
under
the
right
circumstances
a
flawless
beer
ridiculously
drinkable
i
think
i
shall
have
another
as
this
bottle
was
brewed
at
the
lion
brewery
in
wilkes
barre
pa
this
is
obviously
an
older
sample
as
their
contract
operations
have
been
moved
to
the
frederick
brewery
in
maryland
it
pours
a
clear
deep
golden
body
with
a
frothy
white
head
that
leaves
some
nice
lace
throughout
the
glass
the
nose
displays
some
lightly
pepperyspicy
hops
over
a
gently
sweet
malt
the
body
is
medium
with
a
fine
median
carbonation
that
leaves
it
crisp
on
the
tongue
before
warming
to
become
a
touch
creamy
and
smooth
the
flavor
delivers
a
rounded
malt
that
obviously
includes
a
good
percentage
of
munich
malt
its
just
lightly
toasty
and
a
tad
sweet
but
very
wellbalanced
by
lightly
floral
and
gently
herbal
hop
flavors
and
firm
bitterness
it
finishes
dry
but
with
a
lingering
maltiness
quite
nice
and
highly
drinkable
its
refreshing
but
also
offers
enough
character
to
make
you
want
another
a
good
example
of
the
munich
helles
style
at
a
very
nice
price
well
done
and
certainly
worth
trying
a
lager
that
is
more
towards
a
yuengling
except
for
color
and
taste
where
it
is
a
lighter
gold
color
and
the
taste
is
a
bit
more
hoppy
its
an
above
average
lager
that
is
good
after
long
day
the
alcohol
is
not
present
and
it
is
a
beer
that
can
go
well
with
just
most
blander
dishes
it
is
not
one
of
the
best
lagers
out
there
but
its
better
than
any
macro
made
a
beer
rookies
leap
to
the
big
leagues
in
a
small
way
i
can
smell
a
fruitiness
possibly
peaches
on
the
nose
some
lingering
sweetness
a
very
unique
and
flavourful
lager
beer
absolutely
awesome
sweet
smell
light
gold
color
with
rapidly
disapating
head
appearance
isnt
the
best
but
taste
is
excellent
light
and
smooth
with
a
light
grace
of
hops
with
a
shadowy
background
of
light
malts
easy
to
drink
in
mass
quanities
well
balanced
mouthfeel
not
bitter
or
sweet
and
has
a
very
silky
quality
on
the
palate
rich
golden
color
topped
by
a
tight
white
head
that
fades
to
a
layer
of
thin
foam
a
very
light
and
loose
lacing
is
left
on
the
glass
aroma
is
light
with
a
bready
malt
character
accented
by
a
touch
of
peppery
hops
the
taste
is
also
very
light
and
crisp
with
just
a
touch
of
malt
evident
the
hop
bitterness
is
a
bit
more
prevalent
than
i
expected
the
beer
has
decent
bitterness
on
the
finish
but
a
slight
metallic
note
detracts
from
the
flavor
mouthfeel
is
crisp
and
fresh
with
decent
carbonation
the
drinkability
is
good
and
would
be
better
with
a
bit
cleaner
finish
a
decent
brew
but
not
the
best
stoudts
has
to
offer
pours
pale
golden
color
huge
white
frothy
head
that
clings
to
my
glass
spicy
hop
aroma
nice
balanced
bready
flavor
crisp
and
clean
finishes
dry
light
body
a
little
harsh
mouthfeel
a
great
beer
and
very
drinkable
i
like
this
one
well
to
honest
when
they
told
me
it
was
a
lager
i
was
a
bit
hesitant
but
i
was
presently
surprised
it
was
a
light
gold
color
and
formed
a
bubbly
white
head
some
carbonation
was
present
an
aroma
of
malt
and
grain
was
present
a
flavor
of
matl
and
grain
with
a
bit
of
a
tartness
to
it
possibly
brought
on
by
the
carbonation
a
nice
finish
to
it
all
and
all
a
very
nice
beer
for
this
style
this
is
definitely
one
you
can
give
to
people
who
have
never
had
the
nerve
to
try
an
ale
golden
yellow
and
a
malty
nose
smooth
and
very
tasty
765
ml
bottle
purchased
at
the
brewery
bright
gold
body
stopped
by
a
fluffy
white
head
with
enough
carbonation
it
sounded
like
rice
crispies
when
i
poured
nice
lacing
very
classic
looking
fresh
hay
in
nose
with
a
whiff
of
malt
sweetness
strong
malt
body
wonderfully
balanced
by
hop
zing
excellent
beer
to
serve
to
a
mixed
group
of
craft
fans
and
bud
drinkers
smells
hoppy
with
a
hint
of
spice
and
sweetness
rich
malt
flavor
with
a
good
hop
bite
goes
down
exceptionaly
smooth
with
a
hint
of
spice
good
session
beer
an
outstanding
lager
clear
gold
color
creamy
head
with
great
looking
lace
very
smooth
luxurious
mouthfeel
but
equally
refreshing
precisely
balanced
malt
and
hop
character
seems
to
me
this
brew
blends
well
the
traits
of
the
various
european
lagerpils
styles
definitely
a
beer
that
could
easily
become
a
regular
in
my
fridge
notes
this
one
is
a
bit
in
the
raw
and
lovely
at
that
there
are
lagers
then
there
are
great
ones
and
this
is
one
of
the
great
ones
seek
this
one
out
id
have
to
have
it
say
it
is
a
must
try
if
you
like
munich
style
lagers
pours
a
nice
clear
golden
color
with
a
nice
fluffy
head
with
deep
pockets
aromas
of
saaz
hops
gives
off
a
peppery
smell
and
taste
there
is
a
very
good
balance
between
the
munichstyle
malt
and
the
saaz
hops
overall
another
good
brew
from
stoudts
and
a
very
good
munichstyle
helles
lager
overall
a
real
interesting
helles
that
seems
to
be
bigger
on
taste
and
certainly
feel
than
expected
all
this
in
a
slightly
lighter
package
really
well
done
o
a
superb
german
lager
and
a
wonderful
authentic
representation
of
a
classic
and
often
underappreciated
style
the
beer
poured
a
clear
golden
color
that
produced
big
light
white
head
that
was
very
well
retained
which
settled
into
a
thin
cap
for
the
duration
of
the
beer
the
beer
had
a
good
aroma
to
it
sweet
malt
with
a
hint
of
lemon
and
spice
the
taste
of
the
beer
was
just
as
good
if
not
better
and
exactly
what
i
would
think
of
for
this
style
nice
balance
with
just
a
slight
edge
to
the
malt
and
still
with
that
hint
of
lemon
the
beer
had
a
light
body
to
it
the
beer
was
clean
crisp
smooth
and
extremely
easy
to
drink
i
could
drink
this
all
of
the
time
i
think
freshness
is
definitely
key
for
this
beer
ive
had
some
meh
bottles
and
ive
had
great
ones
this
particular
one
falls
in
the
latter
category
nice
straight
up
lager
thats
stellar
all
around
definitely
sessionable
the
500ml
size
is
nice
but
id
love
to
see
this
in
6packs
o
wish
i
had
another
bottle
this
is
seriously
good
stuff
im
a
huge
fan
of
the
style
and
this
is
up
there
with
schlenkerla
i
could
drink
endless
amounts
of
this
delicious
lager
o
not
a
bad
beer
but
i
am
disappointed
one
of
the
best
rated
beers
of
this
style
which
happens
to
be
my
favorite
but
nothing
makes
me
want
to
purchase
again
i
would
gladly
try
again
if
found
somewhere
cheaper
paid
5
49
for
this
500
ml
bottle
not
worth
it
at
all
but
in
the
end
there
are
many
better
and
cheaper
helles
lagers
its
worth
a
try
for
lager
fans
this
one
is
golden
yellow
in
color
with
a
thick
collar
which
retains
well
honey
and
grass
make
the
aroma
and
both
aromas
are
vibrant
the
taste
is
clean
with
pleasant
grassy
notes
honey
bread
and
a
subtle
citric
note
with
a
slight
crispness
and
lightmedium
body
which
helps
make
this
beer
very
refreshing
this
is
one
of
many
candidates
for
the
stereotypical
helles
lager
o
it
seems
like
the
brewer
was
trying
to
make
the
easiestdrinking
beer
on
the
planet
something
that
bud
miller
and
coors
have
been
trying
to
do
for
years
and
i
think
they
just
may
have
succeeded
from
first
sip
to
last
this
was
everything
i
wanted
in
an
everyday
beer
smooth
pleasing
flavors
that
still
dont
lack
depth
as
well
as
a
creamy
texture
that
doesnt
fill
you
up
its
a
shame
i
wont
be
able
to
have
it
fresh
unless
i
buy
a
ticket
to
europe
still
ill
be
buying
up
whatever
bottles
i
can
while
i
have
the
chance
prost
had
the
pleasure
of
trying
this
one
tap
during
its
short
span
at
775
gastropub
its
a
perfectly
clean
lager
with
a
nice
dose
of
malts
and
just
enough
hops
to
balance
it
out
it
was
very
very
smooth
almost
too
smooth
a
little
more
crispiness
would
have
been
cool
but
i
liked
it
for
what
it
was
just
fine
why
did
the
glass
have
to
be
14oz
i
wanted
so
much
more
pale
golden
colour
medium
head
clear
initial
red
cabbage
aroma
faded
also
detected
some
malt
and
citrus
initially
i
tasted
a
burst
of
nut
and
mushroom
which
promised
much
but
soon
faded
it
had
a
pleasant
balanced
malty
sweetness
but
it
could
have
been
more
crisp
texture
smooth
on
the
palate
light
to
medium
carbonation
expected
a
lot
after
the
first
sip
eventhough
it
didnt
quite
deliver
it
was
still
not
bad
mouthfeel
is
great
light
body
moderate
to
full
carbonation
exceptionally
refreshing
for
a
hot
summer
day
overall
quite
nice
wish
i
could
try
this
on
cask
its
quite
tasty
and
drinkable
sessionable
and
good
for
what
ive
come
to
expect
of
good
german
beers
esp
mahrs
beer
is
mediumbodied
with
fairly
active
carbonation
though
the
beer
isnt
prickly
on
the
palate
resulting
mouthfeel
is
crisp
and
tight
across
the
palate
the
sip
is
moved
along
quickly
due
to
the
carbonation
finishes
quite
dry
with
little
residual
sugar
as
there
isnt
any
stickiness
on
the
mouth
afterwards
high
c
this
was
a
crisp
beautiful
beer
i
had
two
of
these
and
could
have
had
several
more
medium
carbonation
and
medium
body
are
solid
i
cant
believe
im
saying
this
but
i
think
a
lighter
body
would
turn
up
the
crisp
factor
all
in
all
this
is
an
excellent
example
of
the
style
and
is
no
doubt
a
fine
beer
the
malt
character
is
just
too
onedimensional
even
for
a
helles
ill
stick
with
weltenberger
kloster
barock
hell
especially
at
half
the
price
this
is
a
golden
straw
color
with
a
sweet
floral
honeyed
aroma
lucky
bees
the
taste
has
a
hint
of
that
honeysweetness
which
lasts
all
the
way
through
theres
a
fizzy
effervescence
that
keeps
it
light
i
have
no
idea
how
the
bottled
product
stacks
up
to
this
the
ungespundetes
imports
tend
to
be
soso
but
this
was
was
up
there
with
the
best
beers
ive
had
anywhere
o
anyone
who
wants
to
learn
what
german
beer
can
be
all
about
and
wants
to
know
why
many
of
us
look
for
the
best
examples
of
the
styles
owes
it
to
themselves
to
look
into
this
beer
imagine
all
this
malt
character
in
a
4
9
abv
beer
thats
precision
lager
brewing
another
good
one
from
mahrs
overall
more
hoppy
than
expected
a
rather
fine
example
of
the
style
i
do
not
often
drink
this
style
or
lagers
at
all
and
i
found
this
beer
to
be
much
better
than
expected
it
was
subtle
and
very
drinkable
o
this
is
a
very
wellbalanced
lager
it
doesnt
hit
you
in
the
face
it
just
does
what
it
does
very
very
well
o
at
the
end
of
the
day
it
comes
down
to
the
flavor
of
a
beer
and
this
flavor
does
not
cut
it
d
the
beer
is
very
easy
to
drink
and
its
low
alcohol
makes
it
very
sessionable
blindingly
yellow
with
a
sheetwhite
head
that
is
loose
and
bubbly
just
as
youd
want
in
a
beer
like
this
theres
some
odd
sweetness
in
the
aroma
is
it
corn
it
smells
like
it
sharp
bubbles
hit
first
in
the
taste
followed
by
some
sweetness
that
remains
unidentifiable
more
corn
molasses
some
easily
identifiable
malt
and
finally
a
bite
from
the
hops
that
is
bitter
but
refreshing
worth
seeking
out
to
try
for
the
first
time
worth
drinking
now
and
then
but
not
a
musthave
ordered
a
bottle
at
tap
and
table
served
with
a
tall
mahrs
glass
stein
the
beer
was
a
beautiful
clear
gold
with
a
tall
white
head
were
off
to
a
good
start
theres
the
appropriate
hint
of
sulfur
in
the
aroma
with
light
bread
crust
this
is
a
true
german
lager
it
doesnt
have
the
most
unique
or
compelling
flavor
but
its
super
drinkable
and
tasty
the
subtle
bread
and
grain
flavors
are
complimented
by
a
small
spicy
hop
kick
in
the
finish
poured
into
mason
jar
decent
head
lemongrassy
aroma
head
dwindles
to
nothing
and
not
much
lacing
to
see
tastes
very
mellow
and
refreshing
nice
almost
sweet
malty
medium
light
body
that
ends
slightly
grassy
and
dry
finish
a
good
brew
i
will
try
more
from
mahrs
bräu
try
one
on
a
very
refreshing
and
drinkable
brew
mouthfeel
is
full
and
smooth
and
the
sparkle
is
light
all
combines
to
make
for
high
drinkability
d
this
beer
has
a
nice
freshness
in
the
malt
flavors
and
a
good
support
by
the
hops
just
a
bit
more
carbonation
could
have
really
helped
the
finish
d
mahrs
still
continues
to
amaze
me
this
may
be
one
of
their
best
offerings
very
easy
to
drink
i
wish
i
had
more
than
one
pour
is
a
yellow
gold
with
a
rather
small
head
smell
is
like
a
pilsner
not
so
much
on
the
bright
malty
side
smell
of
straw
apple
and
some
honey
the
taste
is
earthy
some
applehoney
sweet
but
the
beer
seems
to
be
carried
by
the
bitterness
i
know
that
between
a
helles
and
a
german
pilsner
the
comparison
is
like
splitting
hairs
but
it
seems
as
if
this
still
has
to
much
hops
headlining
for
the
style
the
malt
character
is
rather
simple
and
subsidiary
to
the
dry
earth
bitter
of
the
pilsner
hop
overall
it
mighty
flavorful
for
such
a
small
beer
this
beer
is
a
light
copper
color
with
a
thick
snow
white
head
and
lace
i
hardly
ever
notice
the
aroma
it
seems
until
half
way
through
it
has
fruity
hoppy
smell
with
a
little
bit
of
malt
it
is
sort
of
buttery
you
can
taste
the
malts
and
yeast
in
this
beers
body
but
they
are
not
overpowering
the
hops
in
are
mildly
floral
the
mouthfeel
is
fizzy
but
there
is
hardly
any
bite
not
a
bad
beer
probably
not
at
its
peak
condition
after
traveling
across
the
pond
but
still
quite
quaffable
moan
and
dove
had
this
bottled
after
a
long
hiatus
from
the
bar
the
drink
poured
with
a
clear
gold
appearance
the
head
quickly
thinned
away
toward
mostly
lacing
the
aromas
were
in
general
faint
fruits
hops
malt
and
even
some
hints
of
vanilla
the
taste
was
mostly
bittersweet
with
sharp
hops
and
doughy
flavors
great
carbonation
made
this
enjoyable
until
the
end
overall
wicked
good
d
tasty
goes
down
very
easily
not
filling
at
all
mild
kick
excellent
representation
of
style
this
is
nice
lighter
beer
to
drink
for
a
long
time
d
really
tasty
beer
i
would
buy
again
you
dont
come
around
a
good
german
made
helles
lager
often
and
it
really
is
a
treat
when
you
stumble
on
one
like
this
poured
into
a
5
liter
sten
a
light
clear
lemon
yellow
with
a
tight
one
finger
fluffy
white
head
that
held

stood
out
most
in
the
aroma
with
a
little
funky
wet
grainlike
note
slightly
toasted

flavors
along
with
a
passing
mineral
character
melds
into
a
lemony

over
complex

sturdy
and
solid
it
went
great
with
a
lemon

i
made
tonight
better
than
any
white
wine
in
my
mindjust
a
solid
helles
lager
here
to
be
had
overall
a
very
good
example
of
a
helles
nothing
crazy
but
nothing
has
to
be
thats
the
beauty
of
a
helles
d
easy
to
drink
nice
malty
sweetness
is
very
pleasing
and
makes
this
beer
easily
sessionable
taste
relies
mostly
on
the
malt
which
gives
the
beer
its
character
on
top
of
that
there
is
a
clean
bitterness
that
is
a
bit
spicy
and
herbal
mouthfeel
is
dry
and
bitter
on
the
tongue
drinkability
is
good

too
exciting

you

it

pretty
good
i
like
the
change
up
this
one
threw
me
not
exactly
what
i
was
expecting
but
still
very
good
more
like
a
german
macro
lager
if
you
will
worth
trying

just
had
a
fresher
sample
the
mouthfeel
seemed
smoother
and
there
was
a
slight
butterscotch

there

not

im
not

impressed
they
could
have
done

much

done
this
beer
so
much
better

bad
the

to
be
desired
lighter

very

with

some

and

slightly

a

not

grassy
but
not
raw
smooth
finish
complexity
with
everything
working
perfectly
three
bottles
of
this
went
down
without
a
problem
i
still
want
more
the
beer
pours
a
hazy
pale
gold
color
with
a
thick
frothy
white
head
that
slowly
fades
to
lacing
the
aroma
is
good
it
has
a
wonderfully
malty
scent
that
boasts
of
pale
and
munich
malts
along
with
a
spicey
german
hop
aroma
its
sweet
and
creamy
smelling
the
taste
is
decent
its
a
light
beer
with
a
mild
malty
feel
and
a
sharp
hop
content
it
goes
down
easy
with
some
residual
maltiness
but
finishes
bitter
and
grassy
its
got
a
fruity
nature
but
seems
to
be
a
little
too
hoppy
the
malts
in
the
aroma
are
not
as
pronounced
in
flavor
the
mouthfeel
is
decent
as
well
this
is
a
lowmedium
bodied
beer
with
good
carbonation
this
is
a
pretty
good
brew
but
ive
had
better
i
was
looking
for
something
a
little
maltier
but
it
drinks
well
nonetheless
its
tough
to
tell
how
this
one
is
really
different
from
the
mahrs
bock
bier
i
had
a
couple
nights
ago
the
main
difference
i
think
is
that
this
is
an
overall
lighter
beer
though
it
shares
many
of
the
same
qualities
starting
with
the
appearance
this
beer
is
a
light
orange
to
darkish
straw
yellow
with
a
nice
head
though
it
doesnt
last
long
and
nice
crisp
clarity
smell
and
taste
are
full
of
wet
grains
sawdust
and
a
lightly
sweet
malt
backbone
tones
of
honey
i
find
this
in
almost
all
the
mahrs
beers
and
a
nice
crisp
and
spicy
hop
profile
i
think
the
bock
bier
has
a
higher
abv
and
therefore
is
a
little
spicier
and
sharp
while
this
beer
is
nothing
but
soft
on
the
palate
and
uber
drinkable
cant
go
wrong
with
mahrs
pours
a
full
finger
of
fluffy
white
head
over
a
cloudy
peecolored
liquid
smells
of
noble
hops
and
mild
malty
sweet
the
malt
smells
clean
and
fresh
a
little
bit
tinish
yummy
with
a
hint
of
tettnanger
hops
taste
rounded
rough
malt
mixes
well
with
the
tettnanger
hops
which
i
consider
taste
a
bit
dirty
and
edgy
just
a
touch
of
caramel
the
beer
is
honeyish
sweet
not
wet
not
dry
but
right
in
between
hop
bitter
is
minimal
but
there
is
a
bit
of
a
grassy
edge
this
beer
is
a
quality
product
that
is
representative
of
the
flavor
and
quality
of
beers
i
had

while
in

a
while
back
mdlight

this

lager
poured
a
crystal
clear
light
amber
color
with
creamy
white
foam
that
settles
to
a
thin
coat
the
smell
was
light
malt
with
a
hint
of
hops
the
taste
was
nice
clean
malt
with
mild
hoppiness
to
balance
and
with
a
hint
of
sweetness
overall
the
mouthfeel
was
very
smooth
with
medium
body
and
moderate
carbonation
the
hoppiness
came
out
in
the
finish
this
was
a
very
nice
lager
and
is
a
great
session

least

in
the
malt
then
you
will
enjoy
this
beer
not
as
refined
a
brew
as
the
burgerbrau
version
i
am
neutral
on
this
beer
overall
this
is
a
good
beer
as
it
should
be
for
the
price
this
beer
has
been
around
since
the
1500s
wow
im
impressed
i
am
a
bit
disappointed
that
the
beer
was
slightly
skunky
considering
that
this
is
one
of
the
most
famous
beers
in
the
entire
world
i
cant
imagine
what
this
beer
would
taste
like
on
tap
but
is
still
good
from
the
bottle
my
only
advice
to
the
hofbrauhaus
is
to
import
your
beer
in
dark
bottles
you
should
know
better
otherwise
im
glad
i
tried
it
and
i
would
drink
it
everyday
if
i
didnt
have
to
pay
over
11
for
an
11
2
ounce
six
pack
overall
while
not
the
best
per
se
this
isnt
a
bad
lager
worth
a
try
but
maybe
not
worth
its
price
tag
try
it
if
you
can
very
light
reminds
me
of
a
white
wine
a
little
bit
of
honey
very
little
carbonation
my
mom
likes
it
so
it
must
be
palatable
to
must

is

overall
this
is
my

o
a

not
the
finest
of

still
a
lager

have

the
smoothness
of
this
lager
is
a
great

cleanser
after
the
hoppy
beers
if
i
just
have
one
of
these
right
away
i
would
give
it
a

but
for
some
reason
after
a
couple
of
pale
ales
it
seems
almost
creamy
pours
a
pale
yellow
with
a
fizzy
head
the
smell
is
a
little
sour
with
mostly
the
malt
coming
through
and
then
some
citrus
from
the
hops
finishing
the
beer
the
taste
is
mellow
in
the
beginning
with
an
almost
tart
finish
from
the
hops
i
thought
it
was
a
nice
german
style
but
it
didnt
floor
me
in
any
category
though
pure
perfection
in
a
bottle
high
quality
stuff
here
old
school
o
i
had
given
this
a
simple
rating
a
long
time
ago
so
it
needed
an
upgrade
very
good

lager
and
much
better
than
i
remember
o
great

flavored
beer
hits
the
spot
some
times
overall
nice
flavors
and
easy

but
not
much
to
rave
about
solid
beer
o
whats
not
to
love
it
is
not
overly
complex
but
it
is
just
a
great
beer
the
beer
appears
a
clear
golden
hue
with
an
inch
of
thick
white
head
distinctly
german
lager
scents
rise
up
to
the
olfactory
senses
before
the
glass
is
even
lifted
refreshing
flavor
with
a
bready
yeasty
quality
that
can
make
a
lager
beer
so
quaffable
a
standard
of
the
style

one
i
shall
certainly
return

even
an
impressive
a
the
germans
are
the
masters
of
lagerdom
and
hofbräu
original
is
yet
another
testament
to
this
fact
this
is
an
outstanding
munich
lager
that
could
easily
become
a
staple
if
it
became
readily
available
locally
at
least
until
then
ill
probably
just
stick
with
other
imports
but
as
far
as
this
style
goes
i
do
believe
ive
finally
found
a
new
favourite
to
displace
the
venerable
and
ubiquitous
spaten
a
wonderful
continental
lager
that
should
appeal
to
not
only
bas
but
beer
drinkers
in
general
grab
one
while
its
available
clean
crisp
and
well
balanced
german
offering
of
how
beer
should
be
this
is
always
a
winner
and
better
if
on
tap
i
like
the
creamy
feel
and
balance
flavors
maybe
a
tad
excess
on
the
carbonation
but
the
flavors
are
good
overall
i
normally
dont
like
lager
but
this
one
was
quite
good
another
home
run
for
the
germans
overall
just
a
classic
munich
helles
lager
the
hop
tones
play
along
seamlessly
with
a
airy
biscuit
malt
body
a
beer
i
would
share
with

do
not

what
is
essentially
a

i
said
this
is
about
having
an
authentic
munich
specialty
lager
worth
every
penny
if
you
ask
me
i
wish
i
could
get
a
permanent
supply
of
this
in
cans
as
others
wrote
its
not
much
to
analyze
just
drink
enjoy
and
not
wonder
why
its
so
simple
yet
so
good
glue
was
stuck
to
the
underside
of
the
lip
of
the
nozzle
on
one
of
the
beers
which
detracted
from
the
taste
and
was
poor
packaging
other
than
that
oversight
it
was
a
delicious
beer
pours
a
crystal
clear
deep
golden
color
with
a
smallish
white
head
that
dissipates
rather
quickly
huge
skunky
aromas
as
soon
as
i
pop
the
cap
and
pour
into
the
glass
luckily
those
dissipate
rather
quickly
revealing
a
pleasant
bready
decocted
pilsner
malt
aroma
with
a
hint
of
floral
earthy
hop
the
flavor
is
rich
melanoid
and
pilsner
malt
with
just
enough
earthy
hop
flavor
to
provide
some
balance
medium
body
with
a
moderate
level
of
carbonation
and
a
slick
almost
sweet

are
so
light
they

the

kisses
the
drink
as
a
faint

bitter
leaves
you
wanting
more
truly
motivating
simply
outstanding
you
could
drink
a
few
of
these
i
like
it
im
not
trippin

its
a

little
the
aroma
is

some

malts
most
brews
that
come
in
a
green
bottle
have
a
skunky
smell
for
some
reason
this
one
had
just
a
very
light
hint
of
that
but
not
like
many
others
the
taste
was
clean

crisp
with

on

and
i
was
pleasantly

it
doesnt

its
put

this

still
not

bad
here
in

decent

overall
a
very
good
lager
and
an
excellent
example
of
the
style
its
an
excellent
beer
overall
really
enjoyable
especially
if
you
need
something
to
quench
your
thirst
i
can
also
only
imagine
the
copious
amounts
of
this
that
is
served
at
oktoberfest
every
year
in
munich
and
wish
i
was
there
to
enjoy
it
on
tap
the
bready
doughy
and
malty
characters
are
just
as
prevalent
in
the
flavor
making
this
tasty
in
the
german
tradition
clean
but
dry
finish
that
lingers
briefly
i
bet
i
would
have
liked
it
more
from
a
keg
or
a
brown
bottle
overall
not
my
favorite
style
by
any
means
but
i
can
enjoy
a
few
of
these
ive
never
been
to
oktoberfest
or
the
munich
hofbrauhaus
but
ive
had
a
few
layovers
in
german
airports
and
some
mugs
of
this
with
some
soft
pretzels
are
always
a
bright
spot
on
miserable
travel
days
a
decent
helles
nothing
special
but
solid
and
thirstquenching
overall
a
very
fine
lager
dont
know
what
else
to
say
i
would
drink
it
again
if
i
felt
like
a
lager
and
wanted
a
good
quality
lager
at
that
holds
up
much
better
than
many
improves
with
warmth
which
is
a
big
plus
texture
is
thin
lightbodied
overall
not
the
most
interesting
beer
in
the
world
but
appears
to
be
a
good
reflection
of
the
style
and
will
be
rated
accordingly
the
taste
is
light
with
a
light
malty
base
and
no
caramalt
or
any
sweet
or
dextrinous
tastes
just
pure
malt
the
bitterness
is
nicely
balanced
with
the
malt
and
the
hops
jump
out
of
the
beer
again
the
hops
are
upfront
and
determine
the
character
of
the
beer
the
yeast
character
is
clean

hofbräu
original
expresses
the
true

proud

it
is
a
model
showcase
of
the
simple

substantial
beers
that
made
germans
so
renown
for
their
lagers
and
reduced
breweries
worldwide
to
mere
copycats
true
you
can
easily
find
lager
everywhere
but
this
reminds
us
that
in
germany
is
still
where
you
find
the
best
overall
a
really
refreshing
solid
example
of
the
style
this
is
the
type
of
beer
i
could
drink
all
night
long
especially
during
the
warmer
months
o
a
very
drinkable
beer
on
par
with
the
style
guidelines
i
would
definitely
recommend
drinking
this
on
a
hot
day
overall
this
isnt
a
bad
beer
i
doubt
i
would
seek
it
out
in
the

and
i
doubt
that
the
munich
helles

is
a
style
i
would
pursue
in

lacing
aroma
is
sweet
with
notes
of
bread
and
maybe
green
apple
theres
a
certain
tart
feeling
to
it
the
taste
is
very
malt
forward
with
the
same
flavors
as
the
aroma
and
a
nice
hit
of
hop
bitterness
on
the
finish
there
is
slightest
bit
of
carbonation
and
the
mouthfeel
is
a
little
bit
thin
and
both
a
really
quite
nice
a
great
german
lager
simple
and
well
made
o
this
is
a
beer
you
drink
after
a
long
day
at
work
plop
on
the
couch
pop
some
popcorn
and
watchread
something
nothing
stands
this
apart
from
the
thousands
of
simular
brews
around
the
world
refreshing
but
standard
fare
really
just
above
your
average
mass
produced
lager
type
beers
another
of
those
german
lagers
the
kind
where
you
start
to
wonder
why
youre
wasting
your
time
analyzing
it
when
a
good
chunk
of
your
dna
has
been
coopted
by
the
general
laidback
but
still
stern
uh
pleasantness
of
this
offering
and
whether
you
should
just
get
on
with
the
drinking
im
strongly
inclined
to
just
say
prost
to
it
all
right
now
pretty
standard
lager
only
slightly
better
than
most
american
macros
not
something
i
would
strive
to
drink
again
overall
great
allaround
lager
flavorful
without
being
cloying
if
i
were
in
the
mood
for
a
honeyfied
sweet
brew
id
definitely
buy
this
again
classic
one
even
nicer
when
having
it
at
hofbrau
in
munich
overall
drinkability
not
bad
not
the
best
german
lager
ive
ever
had
but
not
bad
i
think
the
beer
needs
a
bit
more
malt
to
balance
out
the
hops
but
i
think
this
beer
would
work
really
good
with
food
i
had
it
by
itself
and
i
keep
thinking
i
need
something
to
pair
it
with
and
so
drinkability
is
not
high
one
is
enough
overall
why
is
there
only
one
october
review
of
this
brew
oh
probably
because
everyone
in
the
world
has
already
had
this
beer
and
reviewed
it
years
ago
there
is
a
slight
cereal
taste
to
this
one
its
very
commercial
and
very
drinkable
seems
most
of
germanys
commercial
products
can
qualify
as
a
standard
for
many
other
parts
of
the
world
overall
not
too
much
to
say
about
this
helles
other
than
it
is
a
good
one
o
very
easy
to
drink
but
not
surprising
for
a
beer
that
is
designed
to
be
drank
from
one
liter
mugs
pairs
very
well
with
a
meat
and
sausage
heavy
cuisine
o
its
exactly
what
i
want
from
a
helles
clean
crisp
flavors
half
litre
bottle
poured
into
pint
glass
one
and
a
half
finger
head
which
wasnt
retained
well
pale
colour
clear
aroma
was
saaz
hop
with
citrus
notes
and
a
hint
of
malt
tasted
munich
malts
had
a
sharp
after
taste
fairly
sweet
slightly
fruity
moderate
carbonation
fairly
smooth
crisp
body
very
easy
to
drink
good
warm
weather
beer
typical
munich
helles
lager
o
a
delicious
munich
helles
pretty
standard
a
style
that
i
dont
see
too
much
but
i
really
enjoy
and
this
one
is
well
done
by
hofbrau
prost
o
a
very
sessionable
refreshing
and
flavorful
lager
quite
a
flavorful
beer
if
mass
market
lagers
had
this
much
flavor
id
be
buying
them
while
not
my
favorite
style
this
has
to
be
one
of
the
better
lagers
i
have
tried
o
one
of
the
best
german
lagers
that
ive
ever
tasted
extremely
well
balanced
not
sweet
or
sour
and
a
nearly
perfect
blend
of
hop
malt
yeast
and
grain
flavors
at
least
for
me
perfect
at
35
degrees
or
so
overall
quite
a
nice
lager
wheat
beer
crossover
bit
too
expensive
though
at
au70ish
a
case

o
very
drinkable
perfect
for
a
hot
summer
day
pours
a
crystal
clear
golden
yellow
with
a
1
inch
foamy
offwhite
head
that
settles
to
a
film
on
top
of
the
beer
foamy
rings
of
lace
line
the
glass
on
the
drink
down
smell
is
of
grain
grass
and
some
grape
juicelike
aromas
taste
is
of
grainmalt
and
some
grassy
flavors
on
the
finish
the
malt
really
sticks
around
in
the
aftertaste
though
this
beer
has
a
good
level
of
carbonation
with
a
crisp
mouthfeel
overall
this
is
a
good
beer
that
is
very
easy
drinking
notes
very
solid
and
very
drinkable
oh
yeah
its
a
lager
as
well
hell
yeah
cheers
o
i
had
this
on
tap
at
the
munich
hofbräuhaus
a
few
years
ago
it
was
excellent
this
however
was
a
complete
letdown
ive
been
fighting
the
general
disdain
of
green
bottles
but
this
normally
good
beer
has
taught
me
that
beers
in
green
bottles
just
arent
worth
buying
this
review
may
be
an
injustice
seeing
how
good
this
can
be
on
tap
just
dont
buy
it
in
bottles
single
finger
white
foam
head
with
little
lace
on
a
straw
colored
clear
body
aroma
is
mostly
of
breads
and
pale
malts
flavor
has
more
of
a
sweet
corn
floral
and
grass
note
with
a
pale
malt
background
light
body
and
high
carbonation
overall
refreshing
and
drinkable
simple
but
flavorful
a
little
too
sweet
however
poured
this
munich
helles
from
a
12
oz
bottle
into
a
ping
glass
poured
a
clear
pale
golden
color
produced
a
thick
white
head
excellent
retention
and
left
a
nice
amount
of
lacing
on
the
glass
the
aroma
is
full
of
malted
barley
fresh
cut
grass
and
floral
hops
light
in
body
this
helles
is
full
of
malted
barley
fresh
baked
bread
and
a
hit
of
hops
at
the
finish
clean
crisp
refreshing
and
this
is
even
better
on
tap
i
have
had
the
privilege
of
drinking
this
fresh
at
hofbrauhaus
in
munich
while
i
would
say
it
was
much
better
in
person
on
tap
i
enjoyed
this
bottled
version
very
much
prost
notes
pretty
good
pretty
drinkable
as
always
better
ontap
unpasteurized
a
great
lager
something
perfect
for
the
summertime
after
a
hard
days
work
overall
45
a
surprisingly
tasty
lighter
beer
style
something
i
dont
drink
often
the
american
macrobreweries
could
learn
something
still
one
of
my
favorite
german
lagers
after
all
of
these
years
theres
a
lot
of
subtleties
flavorwise
yet
the
body
of
this
beer
is
very
warming
and
alive
to
maintain
interest
throughout
consumption
far
better
on
tap
at
the
brewery
rather
than
in
the
bottle
and
i
would
recommend
to
drink
this
as
fresh
as
possible
upon
purchasing
a
good
pick
amongst
countless
munich
lagers
to
choose
from
o
helles
lager
is
something
special
no
die
hard
beer
fan
will
call
it
his
favorite
style
yet
hes
sure
to
appreciative
the
consistency
and
roundedness
of
the
styles
exemplars
o
a
lawnmower
beer
with
some
huevos
easy
drinking
lager
with
more
flavor
than
any
other
green
bottle
ive
come
across
prost
just
wish
i
could
find
it
for
cheaper
than
11
bucks
a
sixer
still
its
nice
to
come
across
good
light
lagers
with
some
flavor
overall
the
subtlety
of
this
beer
is
what
makes
it
world
class
everything
is
perfectly
crafted
nothing
better
than
the
original
helles
lager
when
the
time
is
right
o
good
beer
and
differnt
style
from
what
i
usually
have
would
like
to
try
this
in
munich
to
really
experience
it
o
a
very
nice
helles
that
will
not
leave
you
disappointed
this
beer
poured
out
as
a
clear
looking
golden
yellow
color
with
a
foamy
white
head
on
top
the
smell
of
the
beer
was
earthy
but
not
overly
grassy
which
i
liked
the
taste
of
the
beer
had
a
good
strong
sharp
flavor
to
it
with
a
good
amount
of
grain
in
the
beginning
and
finishing
with
a
nice
sharp
crisp
bitter
finish
the
mouthfeel
was
clean
and
light
tingly
carbonation
with
a
dry
finish
overall
its
not
a
bad
german
lager
overall
this
is
an
above
average
beer
the
only
downsides
are
the
moderate
skunkiness
and
it
is
just
a
tad
sweet
otherwise
excellent
overall
a
definite
summer
session
beer
i
had
expected
an
even
smoother
and
balanced
brew
like
the
helles
i
had
in
bamberg
this
one
is
a
bit
too
sweet
a
little
pricey
for
the
lack
of
ingredients
i
guess
the
time
it
takes
to
makecellarlager
a
lager
weighs
into
it
as
well
as
the
transportation
issues
but
still
o
extremely
enjoyable
beer
at
its
original
home
making
it
that
much
better
would
definitely
have
again
a
very
good
beer
for
the
style
this
beer
pours
a
clear
golden
color
the
head
is
half
an
inch
in
height
and
recedes
quickly
into
sparse
lacing
the
aroma
is
a
nice
balance
of
biscuits
caramel
and
noble
hops
the
taste
is
a
bit
maltier
than
the
aroma
with
the
hops
playing
a
backing
role
in
the
finish
the
mouthfeel
is
on
the
lighter
side
of
medium
bodied
with
a
smooth
texture
and
lively
carbonation
overall
this
is
a
really
good
beer
with
real
complexity
that
i
will
certainly
drink
again
on
tap
at
uberstein
they
have
it
in
the
one
liter
mugs
dangerous
i
drank
a
few
classic
of
the
style
crisp
clean
good
yeast
character
goes
down
soo
easy
its
hard
to
stop
was
perfect
with
some
cheese
curds
and
other
appetizers
during
packer
game
recommended
will
review
the
other
hofbrau
beers
on
tap
next
time
im
there
ive
had
most
of
them
out
of
the
bottle
but
theyre
especially
great
on
tap
o
didnt
get
to
enjoy
this
beer
in
munich
so
im
making
up
for
it
here
good
brew
i
wish
it
were
more
complex
though
this
is
an
interesting
lager
it
packs
some
interesting
flavor
profiles
while
remaining
very
drinkable
not
a
beer
i
see
myself
going
back
to
short
of
going
to
the
hofbrau
house
in
northern
kentucky
but
i
enjoyed
this
and
it
had
potential
to
be
pretty
darn
bland
when
i
pored
this
beer
i
was
not
surprised
it
was
a
light
gold
like
bud
light
smell
was
floral
but
not
too
strong
sugesting
no
taste
whatsoever
head
was
not
there
but
taste
was
really
good
i
was
really
surpised
i
would
try
other
types
of
this
beer
light
but
refreshing
not
to
heavy
or
bitter
owow
this
is
a
thirst
quenching
beer
which
isnt
something
i
find
to
be
common
some
times
a
good
and
crisp
german
lager
has
everything
i
want
bought
a
whole
6pack
of
this
and
im
glad
i
did
the
other
5
wont
remain
in
my
fridge
long
enough
taste
is
ilke
these
pilseners
should
be
soft
and
round
and
with
a
bit
sweetness
but
not
much
o
real
nice
pleasant
beer
easy
to
drink
but
still
delicious
o
good
helles
not
the
best
o
a
good
beer
and
a
good
example
of
the
style
clean
and
malty
with
just
enough
of
a
noble
hop
kick
to
keep
me
interested
while
relying
on
the
malt
profile
as
it
should
good
beer
this
pours
a
very
light
yellow
or
straw
like
color
with
a
decent
white
head
which
leaves
a
little
lacing
the
smell
is
initially
of
some
type
of
rubber
or
latex
maybe
from
the
green
bottle
under
that
there
are
some
grainy
smells
and
bread
malts
feel
is
light
and
watery
the
taste
is
okay
there
is
also
a
latex
taste
followed
by
some
grains
but
i
wonder
if
this
is
going
bad
i
dont
think
its
very
old
so
perhaps
the
green
bottle
might
be
to
blame
this
might
be
a
drain
pour
o
this
is
as
most
munich
helles
lagers
very
drinkable
this
was
directly
from
a
case
of
beer
which
had
just
come
in
at
the
store
so
theoretically
it
shouldnt
have
been
exposed
to
too
much
light
and
should
have
been
relatively
fresh
i
look
forward
to
hopefully
getting
this
again
in
the
future
to
review
it
again
i
cant
imagine
this
is
the
flavor
that
has
gotten
such
consistent
high
reviews
here
overall
a
beer
with
finesse
very
drinkable
very
nice
beer
exactly
the
sort
of
thing
i
could
see
drinking
with
some
friends
while
watching
the
brats
grill
during
football
season
o
nice
drinkable
brew
might
could
be
stronger
in
body
overall
a
very
solid
well
crafted
beer
ill
buy
more
of
these
especially
for
guests
who
prefer
what
they
call
lighter
beers
o
a
great
german
drinking
beer
from
munchens
watering
hole
i
took
a
special
trip
to
milwaukee
wi
to
visit
the
old
german
beer
hall
and
had
the
privilege
to
first
enjoy
hofbrau
on
tap
there
in
a
large
1
litre
glass
absolutely
delicious
when
i
got
back
home
to
grand
rapids
mi
i
had
to
do
some
searching
but
was
able
to
track
down
some
bottled
hofbrau
to
give
it
a
second
go
around
and
i
think
im
even
more
in
love
with
it
this
fine
deutsche
bier
is
now
my
favorite
prost
this
style
has
completely
taken
over
all
my
summer
lager
needs
and
desires
heavenly
to
drink
i
cant
imagine
going
without
helles
cant
really
go
wrong
with
this
one
a
solid
offering
that
is
super
refreshing
would
be
great
on
a
hot
summer
day
def
worth
a
try
overall
impression
im
very
sure
ive
had
this
hofbräu
while
in
munich
for
the
oktoberfest
but
this
american
version
is
very
different
everything
here
was
average
and
nothing
really
special
showed
decent
signs
of
a
munich
helles
lager
here
and
there
but
only
at
par
rjt
o
a
light
crisp
easy
to
drink
beer
with
some
good
flavors
solid
stuff
httpabarwithnoname
wordpress
com
yet
another
brew
here
at
the
brauhaus
i
do
plan
on
leaving
eventually
anyway
this
one
pours
a
clear
sallow
topped
by
a
finger
of
white
microfoam
the
nose
comprises
wheat
flowers
and
grass
the
taste
brings
in
more
of
the
same
along
with
a
light
vein
of
lemon
zest
and
a
tiny
pinch
of
nutmeg
the
body
is
quite
light
with
a
very
light
moderate
carbonation
a
nearly
watery
feel
and
a
crisp
finish
overall
an
okay
brew
at
best
one
that
would
have
been
better
if
its
taste
had
been
echoed
in
the
smell
and
feel
the
latter
two
being
far
too
meek
and
thin
and
watery
to
be
really
enjoyed
poured
at
the
hofbrau
house
in
panama
city
from
tap
the
appearance
is
a
hazy
gold
with
creamy
white
head
that
fades
fast
and
leaves
spotty
lace
the
smell
is
of
earthy
grain
caramel
bread
and
earthy
notes
of
hops
the
taste
is
caramel
freshly
baked
bread
and
lemon
with
an
herbal
earthy
touch
at
the
end
overall
a
nicely
balanced
beer
but
on
the
watery
side
dr
its
probably
fairly
priced
in
germany
but
its
not
in
ireland
id
have
it
again
as
a
run
of
the
mill
drinking
beer
but
its
nothing
special
not
bad
at
all
i
loved
the
fact
that
this
came
in
a
16
oz
bottle
since
it
was
so
easy
to
down
the
alcohol
couldnt
be
felt
and
this
is
about
as
bright
a
beer
that
ive
had
for
a
long
time
given
how
light
it
appeared
to
be
when
i
poured
it
out
this
wont
blow
anyone
away
but
give
me
a
bunch
of
bottles
of
this
and
id
be
happy
for
a
while
theres
no
doubt
that
this
is
simply
wonderful
o
great
drinkabilty
as
you
would
expect
a
good
thirstquencher
with
no
major
issues
and
nothing
much
interesting
to
say
ordered
a
bottle
this
past
weekend
while
dining
at
the
beehive
in
the
south
end
poured
into
a
small
dimpled
mug
loads
of
carbonation
bright
yellow
body
with
a
modest
sized
white
head
smell
was
fairly
fresh
with
only
a
slight
smell
of
skunk
from
the
green
bottle
not
enough
to
detract
points
for
though
taste
was
actually
pretty
fresh
lots
of
malt
just
a
bit
of
bitterness
from
the
hops
mouthfeel
was
pretty
smooth
but
uneventful
on
the
watery
side
but
needs
to
be
to
enjoy
in
mass
quantities
no
pun
intended
overall
not
as
euro
tasting
as
i
was
expecting
this
beers
holds
up
quite
well
on
the
journey
over
from
germany
d
enticing
but
i
didnt
care
for
the
particular
hopping
and
0
5
l
was
more
than
enough
overall
a
very
drinkable
lager
it
was
gone
before
my
lunch
arrived
i
could
drink
several
of
these
very
nice
indeed
overall
decent
beer
pretty
basic
and
uninspiring
i
enjoyed
it
for
historical
reasons
since
its
brewred
according
to
the
german
purity
law
according
to
the
bottle
which
also
says
since
1589
a
must
when
in
munich
either
at
the
hofbrauhaus
itself
or
at
one
of
the
many
other
gardens
or
kellers
in
munich
or
elsewhere
mouth
feel
is
watery
with
a
cheap
carbonation
like
soda
i
feel
like
this
is
their
version
of
the
us
fizzy
yellow
stuff
overall
its
a
nice
lager
very
light
and
crisp
really
nothing
special
but
sitting
in
the
hofbrauhaus
it
tastes
delicious
could
use
some
more
balance
but
very
drinkable
and
refreshing
with
the
bitterness
very
good
bavarian
lager
simple
yet
pleasurable
nice
choice
to
pair
with
fish
or
salad
along
with
everyday
usage
i
currently
have
a
keg
of
hafbrau
original
and
my
rating
is
based
on
what
is
sold
here
in
the
u
s
overall
its
a
4
0
the
hofbrau
sold
in
germany
is
much
better
its
so
clean
and
fresh
straight
from
the
barrel
and
naturally
carbonated
definitely
one
of
best
beers
ive
had
this
beer
washes
down
heavy
meals
and
sorrows
bright
gold
in
color
with
a
foamy
white
head
tangy
malt
nose
with
some
faint
clean
grassy
hops
in
the
background
along
with
some
lemony
notes
flavor
is
well
balanced
and
slightly
favors
sweetness
it
is
a
clean
smooth
slightlysweet
malt
palate
with
a
bit
of
a
sour
aftertaste
all
without
being
watery
it
wont
wow
you
with
its
complexity
but
this
beer
is
a
solid
choice
poured
on
tap
at
the
hofbrahaus
in
las
vegas
into
a
1l
beer
stein
and
probably
in
munich
back
in
my
days
light
gold
color
with
a
big
white
head
good
lace
as
the
beer
drops
subtle
malty
aroma
with
light
kiwi
and
apple
touches
bready
malt
flavor
that
is
lighter
in
intensity
and
a
dash
of
bright
watermelon
subtle
spicy
and
fruity
hops
in
the
flavor
with
a
touch
of
bitterness
mediumlight
body
and
smooth
but
ample
carbonation
a
nice
malt
accented
helles
very
drinkable
beer
hence
the
high
ranking
i
gave
it
finish
is
smooth
and
sleek
with
a
good
mouthfeel
and
very
drinkable
could
be
a
nice
session
beer
hofbrau
is
a
basic
nofrills
lager
but
with
enough
balanced
flavor
to
be
worthy
solid
enjoyable
and
quite
drinkable
definitely
recommend
was
not
too
impressed
with
the
initial
appearance
but
hey
it
tasted
great
drinkability
very
refreshing
and
crisp
without
sacrificing
complexities
in
the
flavor
one
of
the
better
choices
for
the
style
d
a
pretty
good
german
lager
lots
of
floral
and
earthy
tones
in
it
and
easy
to
drink
would
have
again
i
typically
dont
like
helles
lagers
but
this
one
is
great
its
buttery
and
slightly
grassy
enough
flavor
to
be
worth
drinking
but
then
again
it
doesnt
really
keep
me
interested
for
long
12
oz
bottle
pours
golden
in
color
almost
without
a
head
lots
of
carbonation
aroma
is
of
grass
and
hops
some
malt
as
well
medium
clean
body
flavors
are
a
good
amount
of
noble
hops
and
sweet
malt
this
beer
much
exceeded
my
expectation
typical
german
lager
overall
very
impressed
nice
well
balanced
brew
i
really
enjoy
hofbrau
original
it
is
a
regular
and
welcom
visitor
to
my
fridge
and
my
palate
this
beer
truly
does
hold
alot
of
character
and
my
wife
will
even
drink
it
notes
having
just
recently
found
this
beer
i
have
to
say
i
really
like
it
would
be
highly
sessionable
if
only
it
wasnt
so
expensive
a
perfect
helles
imo
simple
but
it
does
not
skimp
on
character
an
excellent
beer
highly
recommended
ill
definitely
be
picking
up
a
sixpack
next
time
overall
basically
the
same
original
spaten
overall
i
enjoyed
this
beer
as
a
great
sessionable
lager
that
has
deserved
a
spot
in
my
fridge
i
am
really
diggin
this
style
compared
to
american
lagers
a
good
tasting
lager
then
can
be
drank
all
night
very
high
a
crisp
clean
refreshing
beer
that
is
light
bodied
but
great
flavor
i
would
love
to
have
to
bratwurst
while
drinking
this
now
would
be
a
great
beer
to
have
a
big
liter
mug
and
grilling
some
german
fare
outside
an
honest
and
well
balanced
beer
sampled
at
beer
tasting
at
de
klomp
linköping
sweden
pours
a
crystal
clear
bright
golden
hue
with
an
eggshell
white
head
minimal
lacing
speckled
around
my
glass
aroma
has
a
nice
grassyherbal
spicy
noble
hop
accent
with
hints
of
green
bottle
but
nothing
like
the
average
euro
lager
pale
biscuit
malts
balance
out
the
hops
flavor
has
a
slightly
metallic
edge
with
a
spicy
h
erbal
hop
note
in
the
flavor
mouthfeel
is
light
bodied
sturdy
carbonation
no
off
flavors
left
behind
nice
hop
burps
after
a
couple
sips
refreshing
and
solid
everyday
drinking
beer
this
could
definitely
be
a
staple
if
cheap
and
readily
available
within
the
style
id
rate
it
slightly
above
average
on
drinkability
a
decent
offering
but
not
very
noteworthy
would
work
on
a
summer
day
out
in
the
yard
pours
a
clear
golden
orange
body
with
one
finger
of
bright
white
foam
that
clings
pretty
well
to
the
glass
aromas
are
grainy
and
grassy
and
quite
subdued
and
uninteresting
the
taste
is
fascinating
in
that
the
front
and
midpalates
are
exactly
the
same
as
the
finish
grains
and
honey
from
beginning
to
end
one
of
the
most
uniformly
flavored
beers
ive
ever
had
uncomplicated
to
the
core
but
in
a
good
tasting
way
drinkability
screw
bud
light
this
is
what
it
means
to
be
superiorly
drinkable
atmosphere
is
really
nice
really
full
imperial
appearance
and
a
full
although
simple
nose
really
pristine
and
true
to
the
style
flavor
is
not
complex
but
very
very
well
balanced
just
the
way
youd
want
it
to
taste
and
nothing
puts
you
off
overall
this
is
a
really
good
quaff
damn
you
germans
damn
you
for
being
so
damn
conformist
steps
off
of
soap
box
drinkability
i
really
thought
this
brew
would
have
more
kick
or
bite
its
not
a
bad
beer
by
any
means
its
very
drinkable
and
is
still
better
than
any
macro
but
i
was
just
expecting
more
considering
its
very
high
rating
would
pair
nicely
with
a
real
hot
spring
or
summer
day
however
d
extremely
drinkable
get
a
bunch
and
a
designated
driver
one
of
my
favorite
german
lagers
this
one
demonstrates
the
subtle
flavors
that
i
have
become
so
fond
of
in
this
region
and
style
highly
recommended
much
better
than
the
american
macros
that
i
used
to
have
for
this
type
of
situation
yes
ill
try
it
with
food
bratwurst
perhaps
d
very
drinkable
refreshing
great
for
a
hot
day
refreshing
beer
a
good
amount
of
flavor
and
highly
drinkable
overall
overall
it
was
a
pretty
good
beer
nice
taste
of
sweetness
to
it
with
a
little
too
much
carbonation
not
my
preferred
style
but
still
pretty
good
dvery
good
drinking
beer
i
would
drink
this
beer
again
but
i
would
only
want
it
on
tap
poured
from
a
green
12
oz
bottle
has
a
golden
color
with
a
12
inch
head
smell
is
of
grains
a
bit
of
sweetness
taste
is
crisp
mild
some
grains
just
a
tad
bitter
feels
medium
bodied
in
the
mouth
and
has
good
drinkability
overall
this
is
a
decent
brew
quite
enjoyable
have
had
this
ontap
before
many
times
but
this
is
the
first
time
from
the
bottle
much
more
spicy
and
malty
from
a
bottle
ontap
you
still
get
the
crispness
but
the
malt
doesnt
coat
your
mouth
in
quite
the
same
way
about
2
head
when
poured
from
bottle
thin
lacing
on
weizen
glass
after
first
sip
no
fruity
taste
just
a
clean
crisp
taste
with
slight
hint
of
the
hops
pale
orange
color
with
heavy
mix
of
yellow
hue
great
beer
to
enjoy
anytime
especially
when
temp
of
beer
is
around
40
degrees
d
its
very
easy
to
consume
this
beer
so
it
is
sessionable
and
well
suited
for
drinking
several
of
these
in
one
sitting
out
of
litresized
mugs
the
beer
is
a
clear
golden
color
with
a
nice
thick
white
head
got
a
little
on
my
nose
good
sign
smells
hoppy
and
malty
tastes
very
fresh
in
the
front
is
a
sweet
malty
flavor
and
it
finishes
hoppy
with
a
little
bitterness
the
bitterness
is
perfect
enough
to
make
you
want
another
sip
but
not
enough
to
leave
a
bad
taste
in
your
mouth
it
has
a
mediumlight
body
and
is
pretty
easy
to
drink
very
sessionable
the
way
this
style
is
meant
to
be
d
munich
helles
lagers
are
intended
to
be
light
and
very
drinkable
while
still
having
some
depth
and
flavor
hofbrau
original
is
finely
crafted
and
spot
on
for
the
style
crystal
clear
and
light
gold
with
a
fluffy
white
cap
decent
head
retention
lots
of
sticky
and
streaky
lace
cereal
grain
and
malt
aroma
with
floral
notes
and
a
hint
of
spice
solid
hop
bitterness
that
has
just
a
bit
of
bite
floral
and
grassy
up
front
with
more
of
an
herbal
finish
almost
minty
mild
malt
sweetness
and
flavour
throughout
light
bodied
moderate
carbonation
a
bit
dry
crisp
and
refreshing
quite
tasty
i
ended
up
liking
the
hop
profile
even
though
i
wasnt
sold
on
it
at
first
taste
drinkability
a
good
session
lager
here
from
hofbrau
and
one
that
i
may
revisit
someday
soon
in
all
im
very
glad
that
i
know
where
to
find
this
in
the
case
that
i
want
something
tried
and
true
the
beer
pours
a
clear
yellow
color
with
a
large
white
head
the
aroma
is
grain
and
grassy
hops
the
flavor
is
more
of
the
same
with
some
light
malts
and
some
grassy
and
slightly
earthy
hops
medium
mouthfeel
and
medium
carbonation
notes
again
to
sum
up
this
beer
it
is
well
balanced
tasty
and
easy
to
drink
it
makes
for
a
good
summer
drinking
beer
and
works
well
with
a
light
snack
of
soft
sour
dough
pretzels
drinkability
extremely
drinkable
brew
i
usually
never
pick
it
up
due
to
the
high
probability
of
it
being
light
struck
this
time
the
fates
were
aligned
and
i
lucked
out
if
i
make
my
way
to
the
hofbrau
house
in
munich
ill
be
grabbing
a
liter
or
two
d
not
bad
not
exactly
my
cup
of
tea
or
beer
as
it
were
but
i
could
definitely
see
this
as
a
good
change
up
from
pbr
or
coors
a
real
german
beer
that
serves
as
a
great
intro
to
real
beer
d
late
june
rack
of
ribs
in
the
wet
smoker
and
havin
2
litres
of
this
is
helpin
me
deal
with
the
skeeters
glad
its
in
my
mug
back
before
i
knew
anything
about
beer
i
thought
helles
tasted
like
shit
except
for
the
ab
endeavour
burnin
helles
back
in
say
200405
but
that
doesnt
really
count
i
guess
and
ah
look
at
me
im
ramblin
again
point
is
enjoying
a
style
for
what
it
is
and
what
its
worth
is
truly
a
righteous
time
by
far
and
completely
the
best
helles
ive
had
and
totaly
on
par
with
jarhundert
century
bier
from
my
salaciously
coveted
braueri
von
aying
which
im
still
tryin
to
find
a
case
of
i
havent
showered
today
overall
a
very
drinkable
beer
that
leaves
you
wanting
one
drink
after
another
great
for
a
session
good
memories
associated
with
this
beer
even
without
that
it
would
taste
just
fine
ive
rarely
seen
this
in
the
states
but
its
a
good
bottle
and
fresh
as
can
be
expected
verdict
i
want
to
rate
this
beer
down
call
it
an
average
pilsner
swill
with
a
rotten
nose
but
darn
if
it
isnt
just
the
most
drinkable
and
refreshing
thing
you
can
get
from
a
tap
ultimately
a
nice
brew
that
i
would
enjoy
again
held
up
well
with
food
d
very
drinkable
the
relative
lightness
of
this
beer
combined
with
its
crispness
go
down
easy
however
i
just
cant
get
past
the
godsawful
smell
d
what
i
imagine
something
like
heineken
should
taste
like
a
real
beer
and
very
enjoyable
this
beer
is
a
clear
golden
color
with
a
fair
head
the
smell
was
of
grain
a
good
clean
aroma
the
taste
was
crisp
clean
with
a
slight
sweetness
the
feel
was
light
smooth
and
went
down
very
easy
another
very
drinkable
beer
drinkability
ah
the
light
lagers
strong
suit
i
rather
like
hofbräu
original
more
than
most
other
lagers
ive
tried
and
on
top
of
that
it
is
mega
refreshing
on
the
palate
good
stuff
d
light
beer
very
easy
to
put
down
drinkability
this
is
actually
pretty
good
for
a
lager
if
i
want
a
lighter
colored
lager
and
not
looking
for
the
more
intense
bitterness
of
a
real
pilsener
then
i
would
probably
grab
one
of
these
pretty
impressive
overall
considering
the
type
of
beer
i
poured
this
beer
while
holding
my
nose
into
my
tumbler
at
45
degrees
the
beer
was
blond
nearly
and
poured
the
best
head
of
the
night
it
was
big
and
white
however
the
skunk
smell
made
me
think
something
was
going
to
crawl
out
of
it
the
beer
had
a
sweet
taste
that
was
too
muchtasted
green
i
will
not
buy
again
beer
is
medium
to
light
bodied
slightly
sweet
but
finishes
really
nice
overall
its
a
lot
of
fun
to
drink
there
is
good
carbonation
in
the
mouth
the
body
is
right
the
flavors
are
subtle
but
good
overall
its
all
excellent
i
really
enjoyed
it
a
pretty
solid
helles
nothing
special
and
not
much
stood
out
but
definitely
drinkable
value
for
8
99
this
is
a
bargain
nice
chewy
medium
mouthfeel
i
think
i
could
drink
plenty
of
these
because
of
how
refreshing
they
are
would
definately
make
for
a
great
sessionable
beer
d
really
high
i
could
see
myself
drinking
this
frequently
could
drink
an
ocean
of
these
just
a
well
rounded
drinkable
beer
spend
the
extra
few
bucks
and
drink
this
instead
of
some
corn
and
rice
beer
from
the
states
d
i
had
this
beer
on
tap
in
munich
and
it
was
a
hell
of
a
lot
better
there
in
the
bottle
this
beer
is
just
above
average
german
beer
finally
from
the
house
itself
i
loved
this
beer
in
the
liter
glass
beer
steins
with
a
pork
knuckle
fulfilling
taste
grassy
honey
malt
and
hop
finish
drinkability
is
exceptional
d
this
beer
is
extremely
quaffable
goes
down
real
easily
my
favorite
of
the
nondoppelbock
offerings
at
wolffs
poured
from
a
500
ml
brown
bottle
pours
with
a
medium
sized
head
initially
that
subsides
leaving
a
thin
layer
of
foam
and
only
moderate
lacing
aroma
is
pleasant
but
subtle
bready
yeasty
notes
predominate
with
hops
far
in
the
background
taste
is
malty
at
first
with
citrusy
hops
notes
coming
on
a
bit
more
in
the
aftertaste
mouthfeel
is
very
soft
and
wellrounded
with
a
medium
carbonation
that
feels
very
suitable
for
the
style
this
is
a
very
drinkable
beer
and
one
of
the
best
representatives
of
the
style
i
have
had
this
beer
was
excellent
on
tap
it
was
also
brewed
on
premises
at
the
hofbrauhaus
in
newport
ky
i
finished
the
half
liter
and
could
have
easily
had
another
d
tasty
goes
down
easily
not
too
filling
mild
kick
good
representation
of
style
this
is
a
nice
mild
beer
with
some
flavor
and
substance
that
make
it
worth
drinking
for
a
while
d
drink
it
all
day
every
day
a
quintessential
munich
helles
lager
and
a
great
beer
to
down
on
its
own
or
pair
with
food
mine
went
well
with
my
roast
pork
loin
and
spatzle
at
about
5
abv
raise
a
liter
high
and
session
it
til
dawn
mfd
well
done
crisp
and
refreshing
i
could
drink
this
one
all
day
overall
i
was
puzzled
by
how
the
botterness
came
and
went
like
it
did
i
could
not
find
a
brew
date
so
i
think
it
may
have
been
an
older
beer
that
i
tasted
it
is
worth
another
try
d
i
can
really
session
this
beer
at
a
1
49
locally
for
a
22
oz
bottle
how
can
you
go
wrong
good
german
brew
very
drinkable
not
spectacluar
but
theres
something
very
liable
about
a
well
made
pils
d
excellent
drinkability
great
with
brats
and
other
german
cuisine
d
a
good
session
beer
if
not
a
particularly
complex
one
the
low
abv
makes
this
beer
go
down
very
easy
bit
of
lightly
sweet
husky
grain
on
the
nose
some
grassy
notes
and
a
light
noble
hop
presence
just
a
touch
of
clean
sourness
in
the
yeast
nicely
balanced
in
flavor
and
without
any
false
notes
offers
a
short
dry
finish
and
decent
drinkability
does
outgas
a
bit
too
swiftly
as
for
carbonation
causing
the
beer
to
change
character
quite
a
bit
and
becoming
rather
flat
in
the
end
overall
decent
but
somewhat
boring
and
nondescript
a
good
lager
that
is
easy
to
drink
on
a
poker
night
notes
wowthis
was
good
refreshing
and
such
a
good
session
beer
this
has
a
good
fresh
grainy
malt
flavor
with
a
fair
amount
of
hop
bitterness
on
the
finish
i
imagine
this
is
what
euro
pale
lagers
strive
to
be
but
this
beer
is
much
tastier
than
any
epl
i
have
had
goes
down
unbelievably
quick
and
easy
crisp
and
refreshing
i
am
enjoying
the
helles
out
of
this
beer
i
need
to
find
me
some
more
great
summer
session
beer
recently
had
hofbrau
original
at
a
german
restaurant
on
long
island
called
the
village
lanterne
in
lindenhurst
great
place
poured
a
robust
gold
with
a
two
inch
white
foamy
head
left
some
lacing
on
the
glass
smell
is
delicious
sweet
hoppy
with
a
faint
hint
of
fruit
taste
is
strong
crisp
with
a
dry
finish
very
smooth
and
solid
throughout
and
easy
to
drink
for
a
munich
helles
lager
this
would
be
a
good
choice
for
a
budcoors
drinker
wanting
something
a
bit
stronger
but
wary
of
trying
something
too
far
out
of
their
comfort
zone
a
real
beer
it
tastes
very
smooth
with
a
nice
texture
brown
500ml
bottle
a
bright
clear
golden
color
pour
with
a
soapy
whiote
head
high
carbonation
spotty
lacing
aroma
of
sweet
honey
maltand
grassy
floral
hops
flavor
is
nice
and
hoppy
mostly
floralsome
grassy
aromas
nice
level
of
bitterness
clean
crisp
flavor
and
mouthfeel
nice
hoppy
finish
lightly
sweet
a
very
good
drinker
and
tasty
quite
sessionable
would
buy
this
again
havent
had
a
helles
in
awhile
looks
like
a
your
average
helles
definitely
is
decocted
from
the
taste
and
golden
hue
of
the
beer
not
as
yellow
as
nondecoctions
taste
is
pretty
mellow
and
balanced
tastes
like
a
less
ballsy
pilsner
urquell
which
is
odd
because
its
actually
stronger
abv
wise
just
not
as
hoppy
which
are
most
certainly
saaz
hops
pretty
good
mouthfeel
and
sweet
on
the
tougue
i
could
drink
this
like
water
all
day
pity
no
american
brewery
really
does
a
decocted
lager
something
to
give
to
your
bmcinduced
psycosis
friends
awesome
drinkability
a
very
refreshing
and
tasty
beer
that
goes
down
well
overall
a
superior
german
lager
i
could
imagine
how
much
some
of
you
would
have
liked
it
from
the
freshest
tap
in
town
i
had
this
at
the
hofbrauhaus
last
winter
so
i
was
pumped
to
see
it
at
the
local
beer
emporium
poured
a
clear
golden
yellow
color
with
two
fingers
of
head
that
faded
slowly
with
sticky
lacing
has
a
malty
grainy
slightly
sweet
smell
with
some
vegetables
in
there
too
taste
starts
out
pretty
smooth
with
good
mothfeel
and
some
mild
bitterness
maltyness
comes
through
on
the
tale
end
and
then
it
finishes
pretty
clean
if
not
a
bit
thin
this
is
a
really
nice
balanced
beer
thats
very
easy
drinking
d
whenever
i
drink
hofbrau
i
am
reminded
of
a
quote
by
a
j
liebling
no
sane
man
can
afford
to
dispense
with
debilitating
pleasures
no
ascetic
can
be
considered
reliably
sane
hitler
was
the
archetype
of
the
abstemious
man
when
the
other
krauts
saw
him
drink
water
in
the
beer
hall
they
should
have
known
he
was
not
to
be
trusted
anyway
this
is
a
solid
german
lager
nothing
more
nothing
less
definitely
drinkablewent
great
with
a
cheesebread
snack
and
seems
perfectly
fine
tuned
for
a
complex
dinner
serving
or
just
for
grilling
out
great
brewwish
i
could
be
sitting
in
the
streets
of
munchen
sipping
on
this
pours
a
very
pale
straw
yellow
with
a
nice
white
foamy
head
and
a
small
amount
of
light
lace
love
the
smell
fresh
cut
grasshay
smells
of
farm
country
and
herbal
notes
also
fresh
clean
malt
with
a
nice
hop
bitter
taste
smooth
light
crisp
carbonation
adds
to
the
great
taste
drinkability
anytime
all
the
time
if
you
like
the
style
you
like
this
beer
d
the
highest
and
the
point
of
the
style
a
refreshing
drop
though
to
be
sure
quite
wellbalanced
and
with
enough
flavour
to
make
it
interesting
a
solid
offering
no
brewing
pinnacle
d
real
good
german
lager
easy
to
drink
drinkability
nice
but
why
wasnt
this
my
first
lager
i
tried
its
not
earth
shaking
but
a
nice
change
good
carbonation
as
well
and
a
bit
lighter
bodied
this
was
a
real
drinker
went
down
very
easy
a
very
very
nice
surprise
here
and
worth
the
try
pours
with
a
giant
fluffy
white
head
with
loose
airy
bubbles
ramrodstraight
carbonation
rises
continuously
from
the
foot
of
the
glass
very
appealing
aroma
is
a
bit
bitter
with
grass
lemon
and
some
oranges
maybe
a
bit
of
crispy
spice
the
taste
however
was
a
bit
sharper
than
expected
very
edgy
bitter
even
puckerinducing
tasted
hoppier
than
i
normally
like
but
the
back
end
was
less
zingy
than
the
front
almost
too
dry
but
still
a
nice
thing
to
have
in
the
fridge
for
a
hot
day
or
a
spicy
dinner
this
is
exactly
the
sort
of
beer
to
fall
victim
to
the
likes
of
budweiser
or
tooheys
new
this
is
what
a
pale
lager
should
be
like
and
there
is
unfortunately
a
prejudice
against
the
style
because
of
the
most
famous
and
poor
examples
very
drinkable
very
well
made
and
very
enjoyable
drinkability
is
high
this
will
be
a
very
good
sessionable
beer
for
me
this
summer
drinkability
not
the
perfect
beer
in
my
humble
opinion
but
a
great
golden
pilsener
the
six
pack
wont
last
long
in
the
fridge
light
copper
with
a
big
foamy
off
white
head
that
lasts
for
a
white
leaving
nice
blobs
of
lace
on
the
glass
fresh
grain
and
hay
with
floral
smelling
noble
hops
in
the
nose
tastes
soft
and
pure
with
clean
sweet
maltiness
offset
by
a
nice
mild
hop
bite
in
the
finish
light
and
creamy
smooth
highly
refeshing
and
easy
to
drink
drinkabilitywhat
can
i
say
thats
never
been
said
this
is
a
fine
lager
the
hops
are
pleasant
tasty
and
clean
im
not
the
biggest
fan
but
this
is
nice
drinkability
is
good
goes
down
really
smooth
and
settles
really
nice
drinkability
a
flavorful
beer
not
quite
robust
tastes
wonderful
but
could
have
played
better
in
the
mouth
carbonation
should
not
be
something
a
brewer
is
fearful
of
yet
the
hofbrau
seems
as
if
it
is
drinkability
not
bad
but
nothing
special
either
definitely
wouldnt
buy
it
if
there
were
other
choices
drinkability
a
good
refresher
and
overall
a
solid
beer
not
the
best
of
the
style
but
damn
good
i
wanna
have
this
with
a
giant
buttery
pretzel
d
to
me
this
is
a
fancy
lawnmower
beer
good
for
when
its
hot
out
and
i
want
a
cold
beer
i
guess
the
style
doesnt
get
me
going
all
that
much
its
still
quite
drinkable
but
out
of
the
big
munich
six
this
is
my
least
favorite
helles
this
beer
looked
great
clear
and
golden
it
tasted
great
too
the
taste
is
clean
and
crisp
with
just
a
notice
of
hops
very
refreshing
i
think
i
like
augustiner
better
but
this
is
the
classic
of
the
style
the
only
complaint
i
have
is
that
i
wish
it
was
a
more
gold
brighter
in
color
otherwise
great
helles
lager
poured
from
a
12oz
green
bottle
into
a
pokal
clear
golden
with
a
twofinger
white
head
that
dissipates
to
a
foam
film
little
lacing
smells
slightly
skunked
but
not
horrendously
so
faint
pilsener
malt
and
grassiness
come
through
after
the
skunk
along
with
some
definite
floral
hop
aromas
the
malt
is
again
very
evident
on
the
palate
with
quite
a
bit
of
grainy
character
bittering
hops
are
there
to
balance
it
quite
well
really
refreshing
a
nicely
done
helleswould
certainly
be
even
better
out
of
a
keg
love
this
beer
i
get
it
on
tap
at
a
really
good
local
german
restaurant
usually
by
the
1l
stein
when
i
can
i
also
by
a
couple
500ml
bottles
at
my
local
major
liquor
store
in
glass
has
a
great
golden
color
and
a
huge
head
which
eventually
settles
down
aroma
has
a
nice
smooth
malt
note
taste
is
clean
while
having
an
excellent
malt
and
hop
balance
and
goes
great
with
whatever
german
dish
im
having
at
the
time
or
is
good
just
on
its
own
i
cant
comment
on
the
12
oz
green
glass
bottles
the
500
mls
are
brown
ive
read
bad
reviews
for
that
serving
but
cant
comment
on
them
as
i
just
prefer
having
it
on
tap
thru
the
restaurant
i
bet
this
one
is
even
better
in
germany
trailing
bitterness
leaves
you
wanting
nothing
but
the
next
drink
exceptionally
enjoyable
and
fitting
of
the
season
this
is
a
good
beer
this
is
something
i
will
certainly
recommend
to
my
friends
id
really
like
someday
to
travel
over
seas
and
sample
one
straight
from
draft
drinkability
nice
medium
to
light
bodied
beer
with
good
flavors
and
lasting
taste
if
i
had
to
dirnk
it
only
out
of
1
litre
mas
all
day
i
would
drink
this
beer
among
a
select
few
for
sure
its
a
definate
session
beer
great
draft
german
lager
nice
golden
color
and
lacing
held
a
nice
head
bottled
is
good
draft
is
of
course
always
better
unfortunately
this
bier
is
somewhat
difficult
to
get
locally
however
it
is
very
popular
in
nyc
german
bars
would
recommed
to
anyone
looking
for
a
decent
german
lager
a
must
at
the
munich
oktoberfest
dont
miss
out
on
this
beer
simple
and
delicious
thanks
for
the
sampling
hyland24
tap
pours
clear
light
gold
with
a
minimal
white
head
metallic
and
sour
malt
aroma
the
taste
is
just
like
a
pilsener
light
pale
malt
a
bit
of
saaz
sweetness
and
sharp
metal
very
easy
to
put
down
a
lot
of
these
just
not
as
as
good
as
the
hefeweizen
this
was
an
okay
beer
enjoyed
cold
on
a
hot
day
but
nothing
special
very
drinkable
i
could
easily
see
having
this
as
an
everyday
beer
it
would
be
a
good
watchingthegame
or
grillingsomebrats
kind
of
beer
this
type
of
beer
wouldnt
normally
be
my
bag
but
this
one
is
really
well
done
drinkability
and
overall
its
actually
an
ok
beer
nothing
spectacular
but
very
drinkable
this
almost
seems
like
damning
with
faint
praise
cf
the
current
light
beer
ads
in
the
us
that
plug
drinkability
but
its
not
not
very
memorable
hoping
this
was
just
a
lousy
specimen
and
am
probably
willing
to
try
once
more
some
day
but
j
p
henleys
is
supposed
to
be
a
decent
place
and
i
asked
them
about
freshness
to
try
to
ensure
a
good
experience
disappointing
poured
from
green
bottle
to
hb
pilsner
glass
a
clear
golden
yellow
with
a
solid
inch
of
white
foam
and
a
heavy
bubble
rise
very
fresh
clean
smell
of
grass
and
malts
taste
is
crisp
with
grains
and
sweet
malts
and
just
enough
hop
bitterness
to
balance
it
out
very
crisp
feel
and
this
one
goes
down
very
easy
a
solid
choice
of
a
six
pack
to
keep
stocked
at
all
times
what
happened
this
has
to
be
the
first
beer
in
a
brown
bottle
ive
had
thats
been
legitimately
and
strongly
skunked
eventually
the
nasty
aroma
faded
but
what
was
left
wasnt
terribly
impressive
just
light
caramel
and
bready
malts
without
much
else
going
on
this
is
a
generally
a
clean
and
pleasing
beer
but
ive
had
better
d
very
drinkable
guess
i
was
expecting
more
though
as
i
had
tried
several
of
their
offerings
not
bad
at
all
you
could
do
much
worse
this
is
classic
munich
helles
for
anyone
wondering
what
the
style
really
ought
to
taste
like
now
i
just
have
to
find
my
way
to
munich
so
i
can
appreciate
it
as
intended
the
firm
carbonation
and
light
flavor
combine
with
a
wonderfully
complex
and
balanced
profile
to
yield
a
remarkably
drinkable
brew
kripes
its
no
wonder
the
germans
consume
so
much
beer
if
i
had
cheap
easy
access
to
this
stuff
id
have
it
for
breakfast
hofbrau
original
poured
a
light
gold
with
a
small
white
head
the
smell
was
all
hops
taste
was
great
crisp
hop
flavors
and
became
malty
sweet
when
it
warmed
a
bit
very
refreshing
mouthfeel
was
good
refreshing
with
good
carbonation
drinkability
was
nice
crisp
and
refreshing
nice
summer
beer
i
enjoyed
this
a
good
deal
the
room
temperature
thing
is
the
best
way
to
drink
this
beer
i
feel
it
would
lose
a
lot
of
flavor
being
served
ice
cold
i
found
that
out
the
hard
way
i
purchased
a
case
of
hofbrau
original
and
was
simply
disappointed
all
the
original
flavor
and
taste
were
gone
however
i
did
find
drinking
the
bottle
at
room
temperature
made
it
a
little
better
on
this
occasion
the
beer
was
presented
to
me
in
a
1liter
glaskrug
with
little
head
it
looked
like
your
average
clear
goldencolored
lager
with
little
smell
however
it
went
down
deliciously
smooth
light
body
with
balanced
hop
and
malt
flavors
made
this
a
very
fresh
brew
i
could
have
kept
drinking
all
night
d
good
session
beer
very
enjoyable
defines
the
style
nicely
summary
my
favorite
of
the
german
lager
crowd
actually
one
of
my
favorite
beers
period
more
substantial
in
body
and
taste
than
most
in
this
genre
i
used
to
drink
this
alot
back
in
the
70s
when
i
lived
in
california
and
im
pleased
to
say
its
still
a
damn
good
lager
could
i
session
on
it
you
betchya
d
this
one
isnt
even
worth
trying
from
a
bottle
d
a
one
an
easily
drinkable
brew
and
one
i
enjoyed
consuming
in
large
quantities
when
visiting
the
hofbrauhaus
this
particular
review
is
from
a
bottle
purchased
here
in
the
states
and
from
the
best
of
my
memory
its
not
quite
as
enjoyable
as
the
on
tap
version
straight
from
the
haus
itself
of
course
my
surroundings
and
company
at
the
time
may
have
had
something
to
do
with
that
lol
this
was
a
wonderful
helles
with
the
crisp
maltiness
one
would
expect
from
german
lager
sparingly
hopped
but
enought
to
balance
well
show
this
to
a
lover
of
the
macros
and
they
might
convernt
yet
i
wish
however
that
they
were
in
brown
bottles
because
i
got
that
slight
skunkyness
from
uv
reaction
such
a
terrible
mistake
for
a
good
beer
this
is
about
as
mellow
and
smooth
as
a
beer
can
get
again
this
is
a
benchmark
for
what
a
lager
should
be
especially
speaking
at
the
macro
level
this
is
better
than
american
macros
but
it
will
still
fall
into
the
lawnmower
category
for
me
id
love
to
see
more
bite
to
the
taste
and
higher
complexity
i
poured
the
beer
into
a
clear
glass
and
it
poured
a
light
golden
color
at
first
sniff
i
got
a
slight
skunky
smell
this
turned
me
off
at
first
the
smell
kind
of
went
away
after
it
sat
in
the
glass
for
a
minute
or
two
but
it
didnt
go
away
completely
every
time
i
took
a
sip
i
got
a
slight
sniff
of
skunkyness
dont
get
me
wrong
the
taste
of
the
beer
isnt
to
bad
ive
had
this
beer
before
and
dont
remember
it
having
a
skunky
smell
ill
try
this
beer
again
at
a
later
date
maybe
the
beer
i
had
has
been
on
the
shelf
for
a
while
what
a
treat
from
draft
enjoyed
in
a
narrow
22
ounce
schooner
at
gustavs
jägerhaus
in
anaheim
this
beer
hit
the
spot
with
a
dinner
entree
of
three
different
sausages
and
a
pork
chop
smooth
lemon
sweet
and
quite
a
malty
lager
the
flavor
sits
and
dissolves
on
the
tongue
leaving
flavor
goodness
the
way
milk
chocolate
melts
in
your
mouth
more
please
this
is
usual
beer
which
i
actually
buy
by
the
case
my
staple
beer
as
it
were
pours
from
a
green
bottle
a
clear
goden
yellow
with
several
fingers
of
pillowy
white
fluff
that
leaves
behind
awesome
amounts
of
thick
stickieness
as
is
recedes
to
a
thin
cap
the
nose
is
grainy
and
a
little
spicy
with
some
hops
easily
detected
the
taste
is
buttery
and
buiscuity
with
a
terrific
balance
of
ingredientslight
earthy
grassy
notes
blend
with
a
strong
malty
backbone
that
ends
with
a
calm
sweetness
that
almost
goes
without
notice
the
body
is
nice
and
lightwith
minimal
carbonation
and
a
nice
skunkyfunky
euro
finish
that
lasts
between
sips
this
would
make
a
great
summer
thirst
quencheror
a
great
winter
one
for
that
matter
ive
been
a
a
beer
lover
since
the
age
of
five
when
my
dad
gave
me
my
first
sips
his
staple
beer
was
reingold
of
all
things
i
have
a
lot
of
favorites
but
this
is
definitely
way
up
there
its
simple
and
uncomplicated
to
me
its
delicious
beer
the
taste
is
creamy
malty
grain
bread
lemon
pine
its
zesty
smooth
fullbodied
yet
rather
crisp
ans
very
refreshing
its
on
the
sweeter
side
but
with
a
nice
light
aromatic
bitterness
especially
in
the
finish
it
goes
incredibly
well
with
food
and
is
exceedingly
drinkable
while
not
the
greatest
there
is
a
reason
why
this
is
a
classic
this
beer
does
just
what
a
macro
can
do
but
with
much
more
taste
d
a
great
lager
with
nothing
but
positive
and
no
real
weak
point
aside
from
the
green
bottle
now
this
is
the
epidemy
of
the
perfect
german
helles
lager
a
great
staple
for
oktoberfest
this
beer
just
makes
you
want
to
get
a
bunch
of
buddies
drink
and
have
a
jolly
great
time
i
enjoyed
it
nicely
chilled
in
a
pint
glass
poured
a
piercing
golden
color
with
a
pleasantly
sweet
aroma
the
taste
was
smooth
with
a
well
balanced
malt
foward
goodness
the
price
is
decent
to
so
stock
up
and
drink
till
your
heart
is
content
d
moderate
drinkability
nice
hop
character
but
a
bit
too
sweet
to
be
quite
as
sessionable
as
a
helles
should
be
this
is
a
great
lager
that
grows
on
you
as
you
drink
the
green
bottle
be
damned
i
like
this
beer
i
cant
wait
to
have
a
cold
one
this
summer
after
mowing
the
lawn
light
gold
with
a
yeasty
lager
like
and
slight
hop
aroma
taste
is
lightly
yeasty
malty
with
a
nice
noticeable
hop
twang
to
it
as
well
touch
of
tartness
to
it
crisp
carbonation
and
decent
mouthfeel
nothing
too
special
but
for
what
it
is
it
seems
well
enough
made
decent
drinkable
beer
well
carbonated
with
a
very
smooth
mouthfeel
and
a
dry
finish
crisp
and
clean
really
drinkable
definitely
recommended
mouthfeeldrinkability
great
action
in
the
mouth
right
from
the
start
becoming
creamier
and
easy
to
swallow
at
the
end
a
classic
solid
beer
that
i
am
so
glad
to
be
able
to
purchase
locally
its
in
a
green
bottle
so
pay
attention
to
exposure
to
light
in
your
store
poured
a
12
ounce
green
bottle
into
a
16

poured
a
long
lasting
nice
2
finger
thick
foamy
head
a
bit
cloudy
and
golden
in
color
smelled
of
noble
hops
followed
by
a
slight
skunky
aroma
feels
creamy
and
well
balanced
on
the
palate
with
a
faint
alcohol
burn
on
the
finish
nice
and
smooth
taste
refreshing
good
grainy
flavor
not
too
bitter
i
can
see
myself
killing
a
sixer
of
this

be

they

probably
better
at

aside
from
the
aroma
which
really
isnt
that
objectionable
this
is
an
all
around
good
beer
i
would
definitely
give
it
a
whirl
overall
impression
very
drinkable
and
interesting
enough
to
keep
me
coming
back
sampled
at
the
odds
and
ends

on

pours
a
clear
golden
color
with
a
medium

with
spots
of

with
flavors

the

pretty

around
d
not
horrible
but
really
did
nothing
for
me
may
as
well
drink
something
like
locally
brewed
stella
in
summary
i
felt
that
this
was
a
good
beer
but
nothing
special
refreshing
and
light
i
felt
that
there
are
better
beers
out
there
of
this
style
a
very
good
beer
a
lawnmower
beer
for
those
with
a
couple
extra
bucks
notes
a
solid
crisp
refreshing
lager
not
necessarily
the
best
around
but
a
worthy
choice
and
very
drinkable
update
i
pored
a
500
ml
bottle
into
a
large
spaten
mug
it
had
a
bone
white
head
and
dense
lacing
the
head
receded
slowly
from
a
one
inch
head
to
an
even
cover
and
then
to
a
ring
around
the
collar
nice
malty
aroma
with
pleasant
mouth
feel
refreshing
and
easy
to
drink
030108
d
could
have
several
of
these
as
theyre
so
easy
to
drink
i
believe
being
available
on
tap
helped
out
balance
and
subtlety
is
the
key
here
and
hofbrau
does
it
well
low
quality
beer
in
my
opinion
d
very
good
an
easy
drinking
helles
for
an
easydrinking
day
and
one
of
the
cheaper
german
beers
on
the
market
today
and
easy
to
find
so
that
is
a
plus
d
very
drinkable
indeed
a
high
quality
lager
d
a
nicely
hopped
and
crisp
late
german
lager
very
easy
to
quaff
but
not
overly
dynamic
overall
refreshing
and
pleasant
beer
not
much
body
or
flavour
though
this
is
a
great
example
of
a
munich
helles
beer
great
balance
of
malt
and
hops
ive
actually
been
to
munich
germany
and
had
this
on
tap
which
was
great
in
bottle
its
almost
as
good
but
its
not
like
you
get
to
go
to
munich
every
day
overall
no
doubt
this
is
an
old
sample
i
need
to
be
careful
when
i
buy
lagers
etc
from
this
particular
store
otherwise
a
good
example
of
the
style
drinkable
and
refreshing
worth
a
try
d
this
beer
has
some
nice
malt
and
grain
qualities
but
there
are
some
off
flavors
that
get
in
the
way
i
didnt
mind
drinking
an
american
pint
of
this
beer
but
i
couldnt
drink
a
full
liter
the
beer
looked
good
if
for
no
other
reason
than
the
large
volume
sitting
before
me
with
a
massive
longlasting
bubbly
froth
on
top
yeah
maybe
the
helles
was
a
good
call
the
smell
says
otherwise
just
a
clean
aroma
maybe
a
little
malty
in
a
wishfully
bready
way
but
maybe
too
neutral
to
tell
the
flavor
was
the
same
malty
if
anything
but
not
so
much
so
as
to
remark
about
the
mouthfeel
was
ok
crisp
and
carbonated
refreshing
and
easily
drinkable
anyway
i
pounded
that
liter
like
nobodys
business
so
i
could
order
the
dunkel
weisse
i
can
recommend
this
as
a
reasonable
and
authentice
munich
helles
but
really
there
are
others
in
munich
which
are
better
mouthfeel
and
drinkability
smooth
and
velvety
creamy
on
the
palate
light
carbonation
bubbles
dance
over
the
tongue
with
a
mediumlight
body
this
beer
is
easy
to
drink
i
can
see
it
pairing
with
many
foods
quite
nicely
not
a
brew
id
seek
out
to
buy
then
again
nothing
id
shun
i
would
definitely
like
to
explore
this
style
of
beer
more
though
before
coming
back
to
this
one
well
nothing
really
to
write
home
about
i
guess
just
average
d
a
good
lager
not
my
favorite
style
but
this
is
a
great
example
of
one
fairly
archetypal
d
to
me
this
is
the
ideal
six
pack
beer
you
know
what
youre
going
to
get
every
time
and
you
arent
so
much
concerned
with
complex
flavors
or
drinking
a
meal
this
is
a
very
enjoyable
session
beer
to
have
in
social
settings
12oz
green
bottle
poured
into
a
pint
glass
pours
a
pale
golden
yellow
color
with
lively
bubbles
rising
to
the
top
to
produce
a
small
white
head
the
aroma
is
really
nice
with
malt
and
some
grassy
hops
the
taste
is
malt
flavors
with
a
nice
slightly
spicy
hop
finish
overall
this
is
a
very
nice
brew
and
is
a
perfect
session
brew
for
the
hot
florida
summers
its
okay
nothing
special
unexpected
or
bad
i
normally
drink
this
one
straight
from
the
bottle
dont
like
it
quite
as
well
now
that
im
drinking
it
from
a
glass
12
oz
bottle
color
is
golden
with
a
white
head
nose
of
sweet
corn
grassy
hay
cider
bready
slight
hops
and
malt

taste
of
sweet
corn
grassy
hay
cider
bready
slight
hops
and
malt
body
is
light
crisp
and
with
medium
carbonation

aftertaste
is
sweet
short
and
slightly
bitter
gemütlichkeit
i
could
have
a
few
4
5
of
these
then
i
need
some
hops
im
using
my
pokal
for
a
second
helles
tonight
and
im
hoping
for
better
results
the
hb
version
raises
a
very
white
thin
head
over
a
clear
golden
body
with
some
copper
color
in
it
the
nose
has
a
muted
malt
character
with
a
bit
of
noble
hops
very
mild
the
taste
is
somewhat
dry
with
a
ild
hop
bitterness
with
some
metallic
qualities
again
its
balanced
but
not
distinguished
the
mouth
is
mediumlight
with
high
but
fine
carb
not
much
here
but
it
would
be
fun
in
a
biergarten
the
taste
is
ultra
smooth
a
very
clean
refreshing
flavor
of
grains
malt
and
oily
hops
make
this
a
balanced
easy
drinking
lager
its
not
going
to
set
the
world
on
fire
but
as
a
session
beer
its
very
solid
pour
a
deep
golden
hue
with
lots
of
foam
and
lots
of
carbonation
present
smells
slightly
of
hops
and
corn
and
malt
alcohol
warms
the
tounge
and
the
beer
excites
it
tastes
damn
good
pardon
my
french
im
not
a
giant
lager
fan
but
this
is
like
folgers
good
till
the
last
drop
i
can
drink
it
all
night
long
shame
its
11
bucks
for
a
6
pack
i
like
it
without
falling
in
love
with
it
poured
a
clear
straw
color
with
a
nice
white
head
that
left
some
spot
lacing
the
smell
was
not
pronounced
but
did
have
a
grassy
smell
to
it
the
taste
is
very
light
malt
and
very
light
hop
this
is
what
the
american
macro
lagers
should
taste
like
i
dont
understand
why
they
need
to
add
cornrice
this
is
a
very
drinkable
lager
crisp
clean
goes
down
way
too
easy
good
show
a
solid
brew
a
little
bitter
at
the
finish
but
beautiful
balance
for
a
light
bodied
lager
far
more
and
better
hops
than
most
in
this
genre
you
can
taste
the
freshness
of
the
hops
as
they
emit
a
natural
grassy
or
green
leaf
like
undertone
in
the
beer
very
drinkable
im
gonna
have
to
head
back
down
to
greenys
i
love
this
stuff
wow
the
germans
really
do
this
style
right
in
all
the
ways
we
do
it
wrong
no
adjuncts
fresh
taste
distinctive
a
nice
bitterflavor
bite
i
like
beer
with
my
beer
and
as
far
as
lagers
go
this
is
top
notch
this
a
nice
tasting
german
lager
it
has
bigger
bite
than
most
american
lagers
and
is
pretty
refreshing
has
a
large
grassy
hop
taste
to
it
and
mouthfeel
is
medium
overall
a
pretty
decent
brew
it
would
probably
taste
better
if
i
was
sitting
in
munich
anybody
want
to
help
me
out
with
that
served
in
a
pilsner
glass
the
beer
pours
a
clear
pale
gold
color
with
a
nice
white
head
with
a
good
bit
of
lacing
it
smells
like
grainbread
grassy
hops
and
some
malt
the
beer
tastes
like
sweet
malt
grain
and
has
a
slight
hoppy
bitter
finish
nice
flavor
and
good
balance
the
mouthfeel
is
light
to
medium
and
the
drinkability
is
high
as
its
crisp
and
refreshing
overall
i
think
its
a
pretty
good
lager
id
definitely
drink
this
again
flavours
initially
of
the
malt
but
fresh
floral
herbal
hops
come
through
with
a
medium
bitterness
and
clean
finish
d
it
is
pretty
good
it
is
a
very
easy
drinking
beer
a
pretty
ideal
session
beer
shouldve
picked
up
more
than
one
half
liter
bottle
medium
golden
color
with
a
nice
creamy
white
head
moderate
lacing
smells
a
bit
grassy
but
more
bready
and
honeyish
taste
has
a
touch
sweetness
but
more
of
an
underlying
biscuity
maltiness
smooth
creamy
flavor
good
floral
hop
throughout
finishes
with
a
bit
of
spicyness
yeast
really
smooths
this
out
solid
flavor
easy
to
drink
pretty
easy
drinking
lager
a
solid
malty
but
not
sweet
beer
but
thats
about
it
not
really
any
remarkable
specialty
malt
that
would
make
it
more
interesting
d
this
is
a
pretty
good
beer
overall
ill
take
this
over
a
pils
any
day
but
still
on
the
thin
side
good
for
a
hot
night
d
drinkable
not
a
bad
brew
but
will
not
buy
again
overall
i
see
this
beer
as
being
a
little
bit
simple
but
still
good
this
is
an
ok
munich
helles
lager
as
a
beer
its
good
but
its
missing
the
spices
the
fruit
and
the
hops
in
the
taste
not
bad
but
id
rather
buy
spaten
for
the
same
price
very
standard
and
ordinary
beer
difficult
yet
finess
in
its
simplicity
mildly
malty
with
solid
noble
hop
spiciness
lightly
earthy
grassy
and
fruity
light
apples
and
pears
medium
body
makes
it
very
drinkable
with
a
clean
light
finish
difficult
to
praise
but
tough
to
criticize
also
the
look
is
the
typical
moderately
carbonated
crystal
clear
straw
hue
nice
loosely
laced
carbonation
pretty
good
beer
to
chase
a
braw
with
an
excellent
eurolager
crisp
refreshing
very
nicely
balanced
and
easy
to
drink
with
soft
bitterness
i
will
remember
this
one
and
pick
some
up
next
time
especially
considering
its
a
good
price
drinkabilty
goes
down
easy
would
be
a
decent
but
not
great
session
beer
nice
and
refreshing
beer
for
summer
i
bet
its
better
when
its
brewery
fresh
highly
drinkable
well
crafted
lager
nothing
fancy
but
a
solid
oldworld
attempt
at
a
classic
lager
beer
style
overall
a
solid
and
tasty
brew
on
the
hoppy
side
for
a
helles
but
not
overly
so
this
is
pretty
much
your
runofthemill
helles
lager
pours
a
golden
yellow
and
has
a
thin
white
head
tasted
refreshing
and
pilsneresque
its
not
that
memorable
or
remarkable
but
its
better
than
any
macro
a
very
drinkable
beer
and
would
be
very
refreshing
after
a
hard
days
work
i
recommend
giving
it
a
try
drinkability
in
high
as
there
is
nothing
distastefull
and
it
goes
well
with
food
mk
it
poured
a
ratehr
weaklooking
pale
hay
color
with
almost
no
head
it
did
have
a
lot
of
large
bubbles
significantly
larger
than
most
other
beers
ive
encountered
the
aroma
was
almost
nonexistant
possibly
some
sweet
malts
or
grain
but
thats
about
it
but
the
best
is
yet
to
come
the
taste
was
wonderful
very
dry
with
sweet
and
slightly
roasted
malts
grains
mild
floral
hops
and
almost
no
alcohol
presence
i
thought
pilsner
with
each
sip
mouthfeel
was
semisweet
to
start
but
finished
very
dry
and
clean
with
a
smooth
aftertaste
for
such
a
dry
beer
i
could
have
had
these
all
night
i
loved
it
and
although
this
isnt
technically
a
pilsner
any
fan
of
the
style
will
love
this
beer
musings
i
usually
keep
some
around
as
it
get
warmer
deals
on
this
stuff
are
usually
good
find
some
youll
drink
a
bunch
of
it
drinkability
i
would
say
extreme
very
nice
to
drink
ice
cold
in
a
very
hot
sunny
day
wherever
opinion
this
is
a
really
tasty
beer
and
a
great
example
of
a
helles
it
has
a
rich
malty
backbone
with
enough
supporting
flavors
to
make
is
a
super
palatable
and
drinkable
beer
i
am
not
sure
which
i
would
choose
over
this
or
paulaner
but
this
is
a
really
nice
beer
and
one
that
i
will
definitely
drink
again
d
great
drinkability
could
drink
one
after
another
recommend
this
as
a
session
beer
oh
man
why
dont
brewers
in
america
believe
in
decoction
mashing
this
beer
is
a
beauty
light
and
smooth
with
a
pleasant
hop
boquet
this
beer
makes
me
fall
in
love
with
beer
all
over
again
honestly
i
ask
you
what
more
could
you
want
in
a
beer
simply
wonderful
theres
something
about
the
hofbräu
lager
that
just
makes
you
want
more
and
thats
something
you
have
to
respect
per
label
since
1589
munich
specialty
this
beer
poured
a
clear
golden
straw
color
with
a
thin
white
head
sustained
by
a
field
of
bubbles
from
the
bottom
smelled
of
a
sour
dry
lager
with
a
dusty
coffee
dryness
and
a
musky
sweetness
my
nostalgia
for
the
hofbrauhaus
wants
to
rate
this
higher
than
it
deserves
but
it
is
a
distinct
smell
not
soon
forgotten
tastes
of
light
pungent
and
doughy
grains
with
a
nip
of
sour
and
a
creamy
dryness
finishes
exceptionally
crisp
and
dry
mouth
feel
is
light
to
medium
bodied
with
a
light
carbonation
this
is
an
ultimately
drinkable
beer
had
this
at
the
hofbrauhause
in
munich
presentation
in
a
liter
stein
is
enough
to
warrant
an
exceptional
appearance
score
alone
add
to
that
a
classic
pilsner
color
and
frothy
head
and
you
have
a
winner
the
smell
was
a
bit
mroe
than
subtle
the
pilsner
hops
were
there
but
a
general
smell
of
freshness
is
most
prevalent
taste
is
classic
exactly
what
i
would
expect
from
this
beer
the
flavor
is
not
over
the
top
at
any
point
exceptional
balance
between
malt
and
not
too
outragous
amount
of
hops
but
the
hops
are
the
dominant
flavor
this
beer
is
not
trying
to
grab
your
attention
its
a
classic
case
of
less
is
more
this
is
one
beer
everyone
should
have
on
tap
to
understand
the
style
and
intention
of
the
beer
in
the
us
there
is
a
mentality
that
every
beer
has
to
try
to
out
do
the
competition
and
grab
our
attention
thats
not
the
case
here
you
will
actually
be
wowed
at
the
fact
of
how
a
simple
beer
can
be
so
great
mouthfeel
is
smooth
and
watery
refreshing
and
light
and
drinkability
is
insane
to
be
served
in
a
liter
stein
this
thing
has
to
be
drinkable
and
that
it
is
d
very
nice
drinkability
simple
but
very
pleasing
i
am
impressed
with
the
rich
sweet
flavor
of
this
german
beer
i
will
be
drinking
this
again
poured
an
absolutely
crystal
clear
pale
golden
color
with
abundant
white
puffy
head
smell
is
lightly
malty
taste
is
nice
and
crisp
with
a
good
malt
presence
and
some
hops
coming
through
finish
is
cold
light
and
refreshing
andvery
pleasant
in
the
mouth
a
nice
easydrinking
beer
overall
a
great
beer
to
have
at
any
time
nothing
really
overly
stands
out
but
its
just
a
solid
easy
to
drink
beer
reccomended
this
is
not
my
favorite
style
of
beer
but
i
figured
id
try
to
expand
my
palate
and
give
it
a
try
poured
a
very
transparent
pale
yellow
with
a
light
white
head
the
nose
i
quite
enjoyed
with
very
herbalfloral
notes
suggesting
the
dominance
of
hops
over
malt
in
this
one
taste
is
bright
and
fresh
with
a
surprising
amount
of
maltiness
to
the
middle
but
ending
in
pure
hops
with
tart
evergreen
flavors
a
nice
clean
quenching
lager
and
one
that
has
opened
up
my
eyes
to
the
more
positive
aspects
of
the
style
pours
a
nice
clean
golden
smells
sweet
like
honey
a
bit
doughy
taste
very
good
sweet
once
again
honey
a
little
biscuity
straw
clean
clean
is
a
flavor
right
crisp
and
well
carbonated
has
session
written
all
over
it
summer
brew
for
sure
pint
poured
at
the
essen
haus
in
madison
wi
hofbrau
original
has
a
clear
yellow
color
with
just
a
small
head
bready
aroma
with
a
little
honey
and
grassy
hops
the
mouthfeel
is
a
little
thin
but
the
flavor
is
still
pretty
good
malty
flavor
up
front
with
spicy
hops
in
the
finish
slightly
lemony
flavor
too
high
carbonation
a
little
watery
great
drinkability
but
other
than
that
this
beer
is
only
slightly
better
than
average
well
worth
a
try
hofbräu
is
best
known
as
the
brewery
that
gave
birth
to
the
weizenbier
and
perhaps
the
bock
bier
it
is
one
of
the
famous
six
sisters
of
münchen
and
supplier
to
one
of
the
most
famous
bierhalle
in
universe
naturally
my
expectations
were
high
when
i
poured
the
beer
there
wasnt
much
foam
although
plenty
of
carbonation
perhaps
too
much
it
smelled
hoppy
amd
tasted
bitter
with
a
touch
of
citrus
and
a
little
herbs
it
had
a
crisp
and
full
taste
but
didnt
quite
reach
the
heavenly
heights
of
a
czech
pilz
like
démon
its
good
no
doubt
about
it
but
it
will
never
be
a
fivesweep
field
marshal
in
the
battle
of
european
lagers
this
is
a
very
drinkable
session
beer
the
color
is
honey
golden
with
a
large
frothy
head
the
retention
is
a
little
bit
less
than
i
expected
but
not
bad
the
aroma
is
of
light
sweet
bready
german
malts
smell
could
be
a
little
stronger
the
taste
has
the
classic
munich
malt
flavor
with
a
touch
of
straightup
grain
towards
the
finish
light
noble
hops
mostly
provide
a
balance
this
is
another
in
a
long
line
of
tasty
german
beers
my
only
complaint
here
is
that
i
think
the
malt
flavor
could
have
had
more
depth
i
bet
this
is
truly
excellent
fresh
at
the
hofbrauhaus
john
very
extraordinarily
drinkable
after
all
meant
to
be
drunk
by
the
liter
sweet
grains
with
a
grass
flavor
quality
to
each
sip
nicely
balanced
as
well
very
clean
crisp
refreshing
and
drinkable
a
solid
helles
lager
and
perfect
after
a
hot
day
like
today
this
is
the
classic
for
the
style
it
is
a
very
drinkable
beer
but
i
am
not
in
love
with
this
one
music
deutschland
űber
alles
pours
a
beautiful
yelloworange
with
a
pure
white
though
fleeting
head
smells
of
hops
musty
organics
and
a
slight
ambiguous
sweetness
the
hops
are
quite
strong
on
the
tongue
perhaps
overpowering
there
is
a
thin
butterscotch
finish
that
tastes
a
little
artificial
but
still
nice
the
strength
of
the
hops
is
tamed
by
a
striking
lack
of
carbonation
more
balance
is
needed
here
in
the
end
the
faults
are
noted
but
this
is
still
a
very
good
beer
its
refreshing
smooth
and
clean
uncomplicated
yet
wellbalanced
one
to
keep
in
stock
inexpensive
when
compared
to
2
80
for
a
westmalle
dubbel
330ml
or
3
15
for
a
500ml
poperings
hommelbier
purchased
at
the
same
time
but
price
isnt
everything
hofbrau
original
think
my
bottle
with
the
upside
down
label
is
worth
anything
is
a
good
example
of
the
munich
helles
style
even
if
it
isnt
among
my
favorites
although
it
lacks
that
certain
something
that
would
garner
effusive
praise
there
isnt
much
wrong
with
it
either
i
think
it
all
comes
down
to
the
fact
that
this
style
isnt
a
boat
floater
for
me
mouthfeel
is
fairly
light
just
shy
of
medium
pours
medium
deep
gold
grain
and
malt
both
evident
in
the
nose
creamy
white
head
slightly
sweet
flavor
somewhat
grainy
and
malty
slight
hop
flavor
medium
body
no
fruitiness
or
astringency
mouthfeel
is
medium
and
drinkable
finishes
slightly
sweet
it
pours
a
slightly
pale
golden
colour
in
a
halfpint
glass
with
overly
abundant
carbonation
and
a
thin
white
head
which
quickly
disappears
it
doesnt
look
quite
right
i
think
on
the
nose
there
is
very
lively
dryish
and
toasty
lager
malt
with
undertone
of
delicate
grassy
hops
smells
not
too
bad
but
of
just
average
quality
for
any
interesting
lager
on
the
palate
a
lemony
taste
dominates
with
chewy
bready
maltiness
underneath
quite
clean
and
dry
in
the
finish
with
a
touch
of
delicate
aromatic
hops
fortunately
there
is
no
suggestion
of
unpleasant
residual
sugary
mouthfeel
in
the
finish
as
often
appears
in
a
lot
of
cheap
euro
lagers
but
overall
the
aftertaste
falls
a
bit
short
a
lightbodied
mediumflavoured
lager
its
quite
drinkable
but
easily
getting
boring
i
look
forward
to
trying
hofbräu
original
and
see
how
different
it
is
from
this
replica
by
the
badger
a
little
too
carbonated
but
thats
ok
with
me
pretty
good
beer
very
smooth
and
drinkable
a
decent
german
lager
looks
great
crystal
clear
yellow
white
frothy
head
that
stayed
smell
was
malty
but
lacked
some
of
the
sweetness
the
others
have
taste
was
a
little
surprizing
in
that
it
was
more
highly
hopped
than
im
used
to
in
a
helles
it
was
more
like
a
pils
imho
mouthfeel
was
full
and
foamy
and
of
course
i
could
drink
this
one
happily
unfortunately
this
one
is
beaten
hands
down
by
the
more
available
spaten
and
paulaner
pours
a
clear
straw
color
minimal
head
aroma
is
kinda
nice
grassy
and
grainy
taste
is
fairly
rich
and
full
of
malt
nice
mouthfeel
is
thick
and
lush
my
only
rant
about
this
beer
is
yes
it
is
good
but
i
paid
2
a
bottle
at
a
party
store
its
not
bad
but
its
not
that
good
mouthfeel
and
in
particular
drinkability
is
as
good
as
it
gets
this
one
is
for
having
more
than
one
especially
in
the
social
outlet
such
as
a
biergarden
youve
got
to
dig
the
back
label
text
that
promotes
the
fine
harsh
aroma
lets
not
put
a
red
satin
thong
on
a
fat
pimply
ass
and
tell
you
its
good
lets
endorse
our
bare
fat
pimply
ass
as
the
original
grain
laden
nose
touched
by
butter
and
matchsticks
escorts
a
wash
of
honey
drizzled
weeds
its
a
good
beer
here
imagine
a
liter
or
two
in
munich
overall
i
might
order
one
of
these
at
a
restaurant
but
i
dont
think
i
would
drink
more
than
one
of
these
at
a
time
id
want
to
go
for
something
more
adventurous
after
one
of
these
drinkability

this
is
why
i
wish
i
lived
in
germany
an
underappreciated
style
i
admit
i
find
helles
beers
a
bit
bland
this
example
is
clean
and
quite
drinkable
though
500
ml
bottle
purchased
cold
from
the
beer
depot
ann
arbor
michigan
and
consumed
later
the
same
evening
in
december
2004
i
did
not
expect
this
beer
to
hold
up
to
my
memories
of
the
beers
served
in
the
actual
hofbrauhaus
from
earlier
this
year
this
beer
was
however
enough
of
a
shadow
of
those
beers
to
almost
bring
a
fond
tear
to
my
eye
poured
a
crystal
clear
rich
golden
straw
with
a
delectible
4
finger
head
that
had
the
consistency
of
clingy
marangue
smelled
of
noble
hop
possibly
tettnanger
a
nondescript
sweet
and
perhaps
some
grain
mediumlight
body
tastes
sweet
with
some
hop
character
the
sweet
is
mildly
grainy
but
clear
and
clean
of
fruit
with
a
possible
tiny
hint
of
tannic
there
is
a
small
bit
of
metallic
to
the
hop
finished
somewhat
dry
with
a
fine
carbonation
originating
off
the
flat
of
my
tongue
an
acceptable
beer
but
nothing
close
to
the
quality
of
a
fresh
one
at
the
brew
house
in
munchen
now
if
i
could
only
get
something
that
tastes
like
the
cheesebreadpretzel
thingies
nice
drinkable
brew
might
could
be
stronger
in
body
tiny
print
on
the
back
lable
did
have
the
curious
description
full
bodied
refeshing
and
fine
harsh
aroma
have
made
it
world
famous
fine
harsh
aroma
i
think
something
was
lost
in
translation
this
is
a
sentimental
favorite
of
mine
first
had
it
in
the
mid
70s
when
i
was
drinking
mainly
macros
it
showed
me
beer
could
actually
have
flavor
it
disappeared
for
a
long
time
good
to
see
it
back
on
the
west
coast
after
a
long
absence
a
solid
if
unspectacular
helles
would
be
fine
for
a
crowd
with
mixed
preferences
mixed
sixers
of
some
decent
brews
for
only
5
00
how
can
i
go
wrong
i
scarfed
this
one
up
in
one
of
my
sixers
i
was
expecting
another
pale
euro
lager
and
i
was
pleased
when
i
popped
the
cap
to
smell
something
similiar
to
vienna
style
lager
only
lighter
in
the
malt
aspect
the
strength
of
the
nose
seemed
to
fade
pretty
quickly
though
it
poured
a
light
golden
color
with
a
whispy
white
head
on
top
taste
was
very
clean
with
a
pleasant
noble
hop
bite
present
at
the
end
very
well
balanced
mouthfeel
wasnt
as
thin
as
i
was
expecting
thank
god
this
could
be
a
superb
session
beer
and
ill
definately
be
picking
more
of
these
up
if
i
get
into
a
lager
kick
anytime
soon
light
on
mouthfeel
which
is
not
bad
at
all
keeps
you
from
filling
up
and
keeps
the
beer
refreshing
drinkability
allright
the
mouthfeel
was
crisp
and
clean
with
a
slightly
dry
finish
lighter
bodied
with
relatively
strong
carbonation
a
perfect
beer
to
have
with
german
sausages
or
a
large
pretzel
pours
a
very
clear
pale
golden
color
with
lots
of
bubbles
racing
towards
the
massive
212
finger
white
pillowy
head
the
smell
consists
of
a
slightly
tangy
grain
hops
and
with
a
touch
of
a
sticky
sweet
aroma
the
taste
starts
with
a
grainy
malt
taste
that
starts
smooth
and
fades
to
an
astringent
hoppy
flavor
and
ending
with
a
sticky
dry
bitterness
this
is
a
light
bodied
beer
that
goes
down
fairly
easy
prosit
served
at
a
german
restaurant
in
moscow
this
most
famous
of
beers
came
out
a
deep
clear
gold
with
lots
of
bubbles
under
a
1
5
finger
white
head
that
displayed
very
good
retention
and
some
nice
lace
the
nose
features
some
sweet
malt
but
is
very
subdued
the
mouth
is
fairly
prickly
and
surprisingly
heavy
the
taste
knocked
me
out
with
the
tons
and
tons
and
tons
of
malt
sweet
bready
barley
all
over
the
place
theres
a
bit
of
hoppy
bitterness
in
the
finish
but
not
enough
to
overpower
the
malt
the
aftertaste
reflects
the
bready
sweetness
definitely
a
unique
helles
another
import
served
at
chicagos
downtown
christmaskindlmart
noticeably
darker
than
the
normal
straw
colored
lager
taste
was
surprisingly
complex
too
the
hop
profile
was
almost
flowery
this
was
served
pretty
cold
but
some
nice
aspects
came
through
malt
taste
was
actually
held
back
a
little
i
suppose
this
is
more
representative
of
the
münich
style
of
helles
very
nice
uncomplicated
decent
brew
for
those
in

you
can
pick
up
bottles
of
these
at
the

as

ea
i
know
what
ill
be
drinking
enjoyed
on
tap
at
the
restaurant
section
of
the
main
hofbrauhaus
in
munich
overall
impression
a
wellmade
beer
just
a
touch
on
the
light
side
for
my
tastes
and
my
expectations
of
the
style
would
make
a
good
session
beer
and
as
a
positive
note
my
wife
liked
it
would
make
a
good
transitionconverting
the
bud
lite
crowd
beer
if
you
are
a
malt
monster
or
a
hop
head
give
it
a
pass
but
this
lighter
beer
has
some
merit
this
is
an
excellent
lager
beer
this
stuff
smells
great
it
smells
like
fresh
floral
hops
and
heavy
german
malts
the
taste
is
just
like
the
smell
this
is
a
malty
german
style
lager
the
mouthfeel
is
light
and
refreshing
and
this
beer
goes
amazingly
well
with
german
food
such
as
bratwursts
the
drinkability
is
excellent
as
well
poured
a
very
clear
pale
yellow
color
bubbly
and
lively
with
a
large
foamy
head
that
settled
in
to
a
meringuelike
cream
the
aroma
is
strong
with
lemon
grass
and
a
vegetable
like
grainy
smell
earthy
taste
is
sweet
and
crisp
a
beautiful
and
simple
beer
very
drinkable

some

very

i
think
this
would
be
great
with
a
nice
grilled
bratwurst
and
saurkraut
it
pours
with
a
nice
strawcolored
liquid
and
thick
frothy
white
head
the
aroma
is
nice
and
yeasty
with
some
nice
hops
and
malt
undertones
the
beer
is
nicely
carbonated
which
gives
a
nice
bite
to
the
taste
complementing
the
good
grainy
lager
taste
and
mild
hops
bitterness
very
clean
tasting
with

very
very

with
an
extremely
fresh

nice
medium

with
a
decent

a
bit
of

and
a
bit

just
really
clean
with
a
noteable
bitterness
on
the
finish
hard
to
beat
a
fresh
lager
for
just
pure
drinkability
either
alone
or
with
food
would
be
nice
with
some
spicy
food
i
had
some
vegetarian
chili
with
mine
notes
this
lager
has
grown
on
me
over
the
summer
and
has
won
a
spot
in
my
fridge
a
plate
of
grilled
bratwurst
and
braised
cabbage
went
perfect
with
this
brew
brown
500
ml

a
very
good
lager
beer
brewed
on
the
original
munich
recipe
the
body
is
a
beautiful
clear
gold
with
a
small
white
head
and
plenty
of
lacing
the
nose
is
all
lager
giving
hints
of
malt
and
the
balancing
hops
nicely
flavored
this
beer
provides
a
delicately
balanced
flavor
perfectly
poised
between
its
sweet
and
bitter
sides
very
drinkable
and
thirst
quenching
my
drinking
companion
was
downing
these
like
water
though
he
did
show
signs
of
getting
quite
swacked
had
this
out
in
a
bier
garten
yesterday
and
it
just
seemed
to
hit
the
spot
best
out
of
all
the
brews
i
had
poured
a
nice
golden
color
with
medium
head
that
left
some
lacingsmell
was
slightly
malty
and
very
juicy

appetizing
taste
was
a

great
for

with
a
foamy

and
thin
trails
of

bright
hoppy
aroma
and
pleasant
sweet

smell
medium
sweet
malt
and
fairly
high
in
citrus
and
light
metallic
bitterness
lightly
sweet
and
herbal
this
is
a
fine
example
of
what
a
lager
is
very
drinkable
bring
on
the
summer
and
an
umpah
band
this
is
better
at
the
source
from
the
bottle
its
pleasant
and
easy
to
drink
but
not
a
lot
of
complexity
in
the
taste
pat
brilliantly
clear
dark
straw
hue
fluffy
thick
well
retained
porcelain
white

the
aroma
is
comprised
of
a
lemony

nose
along
with
softly
sweet
grainy
malt
with
a
tinge
of
husk
bready
white
cracker

sweetness
upfront
in

is
followed
by
a
combination
of
mild
non
astringent
grain
husk
and
soft
almost
airy
hop
bitterness
subdued
grassy
vegetal
hop
adds
an
earthy
tone
and
couples
with
the
grainy
malt
presence
to
lend
an
impression
of
rustic
hay
like
sweetness
mid
palate
lightly
bodied
but
with
supple
dextrins
faciltating
a
smooth
agreeably
inobtrusive
mouthfeel
finishes
with
a
tinge
of
honeyish
must
and
underbaked
dough
but
otherwise
clean
and
dry
balanced
innocuous
and
quaffable
in
its
current
state
could
be
an
outstanding
helles
if
sampled
at
the
source
of
found
fresh
soft
and
tasty
i
had
this
on
tap
at
the
hofbrauhaus
newport
served
in
a
5l
mug
the
color
is
a
typical
golden
lager
color
with
a
finger
of
head
and
lots
of
lacing
left
on
the
glass
the
smell
is
a
little
weak
just
a
faint
hint
of
hops
the
taste
is
a
pretty
good
balance
of
piney
sweetness
and
hops
the
mouthfeel
is
fairly
ok
and
the
drinkability
is
good
pretty
good
for
a
runofthemill
lager
noticeably
more
body
on
the
front
side
of
the
taste
a
more
solid
mouthfeel
as
it
should
hop
presence
about
the
same
fairly
detectable
and
in
pretty
good
balance
with
the
beer
style
definitely
more
personality
in
this
beer
and
i
do
perceive
a
taste
in
there
that
could
be
interpreted
as
skunkyish
i
can
see
where
that
characteristic
comes
from
now
not
offensive
i
just
noticed
it
a
very
drinkable
session
beer
drinkabilitynotes
other
than
the
skunk
characteristic
quite
good
i
would
like
to
try
this
in
the
larger
brown
glass
version
this
is
probably
one
of
the
worst
examples
of
german
beer
ive
had
recently
and
the
fact
that
it
was
a
freebee
from
the
store
owner
where
i
bought
a
case
of
good
beers
from
didnt
help
any
it
was
probably
old
to
begin
with
and
so
this
may
not
be
a
fair
review
but
then
few
have
given
it
a
decent
rating
here
looks
promising
in
trhe
glass
but
the
flavor
is
not
of
a
good
lager
kind
of
flat
tasting
with
little
character
almost
reminds
me
of
some
basic
american
lagers
in
that
respect
slightly
bitter
and
with
an
unpleasant
aftertaste
this
particular
brew
poured
an
average
white
foamy
head
there
was
very
little
lacing
on
the
sides
of
my
glass
it
had
a
malty
aroma
to
it
it
was
yellow
in
body
it
had
a
slight
bitterness
to
it
there
was
also
noticed
a
slight
aftertaste
with
this
brew
pours
a
yellow
golden
straw
color
with
a
foamy
white
head
that
fades
into
a
semisticky
lace
nose
is
sweet
malts
and
grains
blended
with
some
strong
notes
of
herbal
and
perfumey
hops
light
to
medium
in
body
with
a
very
smooth
texture
taste
starts
off
sweet
with
notes
of
malt
and
fresh
grain
as
well
as
some
biscuity
flavors
this
is
followed
by
some
astringent
husk
flavors
and
a
good
amount
of
bitter
hops
leading
to
a
dry
finish
an
enjoyable
lager
and
a
nice
choice
for
a
hot
day
theres
an
interesting
flowery
element
to
a
sweet
grainy
nose
the
front
is
sweetish
lagery
apples
in
the
middle
give
way
to
a
lagery
bitter
finish
theres
a
little
alcohol
evident
in
the
bitter
grainy
aftertaste
this
is
ok
not
better
than
that
its
a
very
drinkable
and
unexciting
german
pale
lager
pours
pale
of
course
the
head
diminishes
to
nothing
too
quickly
some
hops
and
a
little
sweetness
in
the
aroma
mouthfeel
is
watery
thin
and
crisp
with
some
hops
coming
through
in
a
the
flavor
a
little
bit
as
well
as
some
skunkiness
the
skunkiness
was
very
small
though
just
a
hint
pretty
refreshing
qualities
here
a
solid
lager
thats
good
for
the
summer
clear
golden
colored
beer
with
a
white
head
leaves
a
good
amount
of

aroma

of
sweet
german
malts
and
hops
the
flavor
is
sweet
and
bread
it
is
a
smooth
drinking
and
clean
beer
it
is
refreshing
and
easy
drinking
would
be
a
good
beer
for
a
warm
summers
day
just
not
too
memorable
a
very
good
germanstyle
pilslager
style
brew
a
great
light
golden

with
a
wonderful
germanbeer
aroma
at
the
start
the
head
is
light
lacey
and
fastfleeting
the
aroma
and
flavor
are
everything
a
good
german
brew
should
be
well
worth
seeking
out
if
available
in
your
area
prost
nearly
a
year
and
a
half
later

and
perhaps
from
a
fresher
sample
than
before
there
is
still
a
healthy
complement
of
astringency
only
this
time
the
malt
element
is
smooth
and
honeyed
underneath
not
a
delicately
styled
lager
it
is
wildly
doughy
and
aromatic
with
massive
chewy
suggestions
of
freshly
cracked
grain
no
trace
of
dilution
in
this
one
a
quality
german
lager
bitter
a
crisp
this
one
goes
down
great
i
would
say
it
is
of
higher
quality
than
a
becks
but
it
is
not
near
the
level
of
hackerpschorr
or
spaten
it
was
a
very
enjoyable
beer
promising
aroma
sweetish
start
relatively
bitter
slightly
hoppy
finish
a
bit
of
a
chemically
preservative
taste
in
the
finish
but
very
enjoyable
highly
drinkable
it
doesnt
get
much
better
than
this
its
hard
to
equal
the
atomsphere
in
the
hofbrauhaus
in
munich
loud
raucous
fun
the
beers
not
half
bad
either
the
klink
of
the
liter
sized
mug
against
the
tap
of
the
oak
barrel
music
to
my
ears
though
the
atomosphere
may
be
even
larger
than
the
beer
itself
it
doesnt
take
a
thing
away
from
the
experience
pours
a
nice
shiny
golden
color
with
a
nice
fluffy
white
head
which
dissapates
towards
the
end
a
very
nice
and
highly
noticable
herbal
hop
aroma
on
the
nose
herbal
hop
spiciness
on
the
palate
all
rounded
out
well
very
easy
to
drink
and
hard
to
complain

half

dense
white

with
some
stickiness
tan
absolutely
clear

very
powerful
hops
aroma
that
i
could
smell
from
almost
two
feet
away
light
refreshing
beer
with
a
bitter
hop
bite
the
only
problem
is
that
ive
had
this
in
munich
where
it
is
fresh
and
a
full
point
better
lovely
white
head
arose
from
my
glass
the
bubbles
were
tightly
packed
and
did
not
dissipate
until
the
end
golden
in
color
this
beer
was
much
more
then
i
had
expected
light
but
with
an
abundance
of
flavor
malt
is
noticable
but
certianly
not
overpowering
as
this
is
a
beer
that
invites
you
to
drink
it
o
overall
this
is
a
nice
flavorful
drinker
very
reminiscent
of
anchors
california
lager
but
its
not
as
big
and
bready
with
melanoidin
character
that
i
remember
from
fresh
munich
helles
and
the
graininess
is
not
at
all
to
character
nevertheless
i
wont
hesitate
to
pick
up
some
of
this
when
the
mood
strikes
certainly
not
the
best
helles
lager
i
have
had
but
a
little
better
than
average
pours
a
strawyellow
in
color
with
a
thin
white
head
that
settles
to
just
along
the
edges
of
the
glass
some
spotty
lacing
was
seen
with
each
sip
the
aroma
is
of
malts
with
a
hint
of
lemon
zest
pretty
much
the
same
for
the
taste
with
a
slight
sweetness
in
the
mix
as
well
no
bitter
or
harsh
aftertaste
and
goes
down
easy
one
of
the
better
summer
lagers
medium
bodied
with
higher
carbonation
overall
a
good
refreshing
seasonal
brew
o
a
decent
summer
lager
anyone
would
enjoy
this
one
balanced
sessionable
one
of
the
better
helles
style
lagers
ive
had
this
presents
a
complex
aroma
and
taste
the
nose
is
bready
and
doughy
with
a
cracker
style
malt
but
flashes
of
lemon
honey
and
molasses
come
through
the
flavors
are
more
malty
with
a
barley
grain
caramel
molasses
tea
leaf
and
cracker
there
is
still
some
of
the
obligatory
bread
and
dough
but
i
get
lemon
and
honey
for
sweetness
hints
of
iced
tea
finish
in
a
very
refreshing
beer
tried
a
fresh
bottle
again
today
most
of
this
is
the
same
but
theres
overwhelming
diacetyl
here
too
now
obtrusive
in
the
nose
obtrusive
in
the
flavor
and
leaves
a
really
slick
body
on
the
mouthfeel
bumped
all
scores
down
disappointed
in
this
version
o
very
straightforward
helles
lager
and
that
is
a
good
thing
no
complaints
here
o
not
much
to
say
its
faint
a
little
too
funky
but
pretty
drinkable
and
unoffensive
if
not
quite
pleasant
o
this
really
seems
to
be
a
nice
selection
for
a
lawnmower
beer
if
youre
looking
for
something
thats
very
easy
to
drink
but
isnt
an
adjunct
or
a
light
lager
straw
yellow
in
color
with
lively
carbonation
just
a
bit
of
foam
on
top
pale
malt
in
the
aroma
the
mouthfeel
is
pretty
crisp
and
smooth
the
taste
is
pretty
refreshing
and
simple
just
a
hint
of
corn
and
almost
like
a
bit
of
grapefruit
pretty
satisfying
as
a
refresher
overall
good
summer
beer
that
i
would
share
with
anyone
o
overall
not
to
my
liking
but
it
was
fresh
wasnt
what
i
was
expecting
from
a
summer
style
brew
it
made
me
want
to
snack
on
peanuts
or
have
a
pizza
dont
get
me
wrong
i
would
have
another
however
i
think
i
would
first
ask
what
else
ya
got
overall
a
good
summer
beer
easy
to
drink
and
refreshing
on
a
hot
summer
day
overall
id
choose
konig
pilsner
or
pilsner
urquell
when
i
want
a
lager
id
probably
never
have
this
again
overall
good
summer
brew
refreshing
overall
a
decent
beer
although
the
flavors
are
quite
fleeting
i
only
wish
they
would
hang
around
longer
something
i
would
consider
picking
up
again
though
overall
a
decent
lager
a
bit
too
sweet
for
me
o
i
would
say
that
this
is
a
highly
drinkable
lager
and
it
stands
up
really
well
to
its
american
counterparts
cant
say
if
its
the
best
out
there
but
it
has
great
flavor
for
the
style
that
doesnt
overpower
and
would
be
really
refreshing
on
a
hot
day
as
a
patio
beer
i
recommend
giving
this
a
try
overall
this
was
a
more
refreshing
crisp
hoppy
beer
than
i
expected
the
quick
finish
left
something
to
be
desired
but
an
easydrinking
summer
cold
beer
as
the
name
suggests
84
b
oa
decent
summer
beer
could
use
a
better
nose
but
it
can
hit
the
spot
on
a
hot
day
o
good
and
refreshing
lager
for
the
warm
weather
it
has
a
wonder
full
deep
golden
colored
body
there
isnt
much
for
bubbles
or
head
there
is
however
a
bit
of
tight
lacing
it
has
an
average
lager
aroma
there
is
nothing
that
special
about
it
there
are
some
grassy
tones
but
that
is
about
it
it
has
a
grainy
and
light
hops
flavor
there
is
a
bit
of
a
corn
tone
to
the
aftertaste
the
mouthfeel
is
light
and
easy
to
drink
d
a
very
enjoyable
light
beer
for
the
horrid
summers

some
light
grassy
hops
its
light
crisp
and
refreshing
with
good
carbonation
this
would
be
really
good
on
a
hot
summer
day
as
opposed
to
a
rainy
mid
40
degree
day
like
today
is
here
at
8
99
a
six
pack
id
buy
this
again
i
liked
it
light
mouthfeel
and
crispness
theres
not
a
whole
lot
to
say
about
the
beer
but
it
is
a
good
lighter
beer
that
you
could
easily
put
a
few
back
and
still
feel
alright
will
probably
enjoy
this
beer
a
few
times
throughout
the
summer
a
nice
twist
on
the
standard
summer
beers
out
there
this
is
an
extremely
light
lager
but
it
is
more
than
that
pours
a
profoundly
clear
thin
yellow
color
schockingly
light
but
with
a
refreshing
and
excited
head
nose
is
german
malts
all
the
way
with
a
hint
of
summer
aromatics
cut
grass
and
dandellions
the
flavor
is
way
bigger
than
the
appearance
and
the
munich
malts
are
center
stage
light
body
means
high
drinkability
but
in
a
helles
i
need
more
body
too
thin
even
for
a
summer
brew
a
not
boring
summer
beer
though
round
it
out
with
a
bit
more
body
next
year
and
itd
be
a
real
winner
nice
touches
of
light
bready
malts
caramel
light
grasses
and
a
well
rounded
and
nicely
done
hop
profile
warming
brings
out
cereal
grains
touches
of
light
grass
and
a
well
carbonated
and
easily
maintained
profile
light
bodied
rounded
and
supple
and
soft
crisp
and
refreshing
on
the
palate
with
a
short
finish
solid
and
easy
to
drink
id
have
no
qualms
drinking
multiples
if
this
was
my
only
option
for
a
hot
summer
afternoon
theres
nothing
fancy
here
but
for
a
summertime
lager
im
quite
impressed
poured
this
helles
lager
from
a
12
oz
bottle
into
a
pint
glass
this
helles
poured
a
golden
hazy
straw
color
it
produced
a
average
white
head
it
has
poor
retention
and
there
was
a
average
amount
of
lacing
left
on
the
glass
the
aroma
consists
of
a
slight
hint
of
grain
and
hints
of
citrus
hops
the
taste
of
the
helles
lager
is
light
in
body
some
mildly
toasted
malted
grain
slightly
sour
citrus
hops
in
the
finish
overall
the
beer
is
very
smooth
drinkable
excellent
session
beerlawn
mower
beer
good
intro
into
craft
beer
on
tap
in
st
louis
pours
light
low
to
moderate
carbonation
and
very
little
head
no
detectable
hop
aroma
great
pilsener
taste
somewhat
light
on
the
mouthfeel
wondering
if
theres
a
little
adjunct
in
here
more
malt
backbone
and
this
would
be
really
good
as
it
is
its
still
an
enjoyable
helles
would
definitely
buy
again
overall
i
have
been
on
a
helles
style
kick
lately
and
this
one
just
does
not
stack
up
to
the
more
local
pennsylvania
offerings
pours
a
clear
wan
yellow
with
a
thick
and
not
persistent
white
head
however
the
unimpressive
appearance
is
this
beers
weakest
point
aroma
is
fairly
strong
malty
and
a
little
fruity
typical
but
still
acceptable
flavor
is
rather
wellrounded
better
than
most
lagers
i
have
tried
malty
with
a
firm
undertone
of
apple
and
pear
texture
is
smooth
a
little
thick
just
a
bit
fizzy
all
in
all
fair
to
middlin
and
worth
at
least
a
try
i
think
ill
have
another
would
i
buy
more
of
it
i
probably
would
its
a
nice
change
from
all
those
ipas
i
love
so
much
the
beer
pours
out
a
bright
straw
yellow
with
a
fluffy
white
head
on
a
good
draft
pour
typical
of
the
helles
style
there
is
almost
no
aroma
off
the
beer
the
initial
taste
is
crisp
light
and
unimposing
the
malts
give
a
toasted
grain
and
slightly
grassy
maybe
lemony
taste
throughout
the
drink
this
is
then
followed
by
a
light
hop
snap
just
before
a
very
dry
swallow
schlafly
cans
this
beer
for
a
reason
its
the
quintessential
summertime
beer
o
very
sessionable
the
lower
than
expected
carbonation
may
even
help
here
missed
the
style
a

once

woodychandler
unearths
a
canned
beer
for
me
to
try
poured
from
a
12
oz
can
has
a
pale
golden
color
with
a
12
inch
head
smell
is
of
malts
a
touch
of
citrus
taste
is
crisp
refreshing
a
tad
sweet
and
malty
feels
medium
bodied
in
the
mouth
and
overall
is
a
decent
brew
just
a
very
average
beer
here
i
know
that
not
all
beers
of
this
style
are
that
mundane
and
restrained
which
is
good
o
nothing
fancy
just
a
nice
summer
beer
an
easy
drinker
and
good
for
a
few
overallnotes
well
theres
two
things
schlafly
knows
german
beer
and
a
hot
missouri
summer
the
two
are
combined
here
for
yet
another
refreshing
brew
it
wont
wow
anyone
with
its
depth
or
complexity
but
when
both
the
temperature
and
humidy
hit
the
nineties
thats
the
last
thing
im
worrying
about
helles
is
a
tricky
style
since
you
cant
hide
anything
while
this
one
seems
to
play
it
safe
it
is
quite
clean
and
therefore
a
decent
example
of
the
style
overall
i
found
this
a
little
more
enjoyable
straight
from
the
can
but
this
is
certainly
a
tasty
and
enjoyable
for
a
summer
beer
o
quite
drinkable
and
refreshing
good
beer
to
crack
on
this
first
hot
day
of
june
the
cpj
hazy
light
yellow
gold
in
color
forms
a
large
sudsy
head
good
retention
smell
is
odd
an
unappealing
a
combination
of
bready
malt
and
cider
vinegar
taste
is
slightly
more
appealing
with
bready
malts
some
light
noble
hops
and
a
little
beast
of
yeasty
banana
a
rich
and
tasty
light
brew
tailormade
for
warm
weather
overall
this
is
a
better
alternative
than
budweiser
on
a
hot
day
o
this
is
not
my
favorite
offering
from
schlafly
nor
is
it
my
favorite
summerstyle
beer
but
it
is
most
definitely
worth
a
try
this
beers
has
supplanted
bud
light
as
my
bbq
beer
go
ahead
and
get
yourself
a
6
pack
of
this
invite
some
friends
over
fire
up
the
grill
and
enjoy
o
this
is
a
great
light
beer
i
anticipate
transitioning
out
of
my
winter
stouts
with
this
beer
every
year
when
i
need
something
lighter
with
flavor
i
never
hesitate
to
grab
this
beer
it
is
in
my
beer
cooler
and
fridge
for
the
whole
summer
d
all
around
a
great
beer
to
me
they
go
down
so
smooth
and
the
beer
is
very
refreshing
canned
this
is
an
excellent
fishin
beer
i
could
easily
drink
them
all
day
long
and
fast
tasty
when
really
cold
too
thanks
to
jeff
m
for
bringing
a
few
samples
back
from
st
louis
are
you
looking
to
fill
your
cooler
this
is
it
drinkability
great
summerfall
beer
these
go
fast
the
summer
lager
pours
a
nice
golden
color
with
a
pillowy
white
head
and
some
lacing
on
the
pint
glass
smells
of
yeast
soap
and
some
hops
not
a
huge
smelling
beer
but
pleasant
taste
is
crisp
and
refreshing
with
somewhat
of
a
hop
finish
in
between
there
are
floral
notes
as
well
as
breads
mouthfeel
is
crispy
and
light
bodied
drinkability
is
good
for
a
summer
afternoon
definitely
very
sessionable
with
the
mediocre
abv
i
could
handle
a
sixer
of
this
pretty
easily
overall
this
was
a
dissapointing
beer
back
to
the
drawing
board
for
this
one
got
a
keg
of
this
one
on
at
home
and
it
is
not
lasting
long
the
beer
pours
a
light
straw
color
there
is
absolutely
no
haze
in
this
one
a
finger
of
white
head
falls
to
a
brief
cover
over
the
brew
leaving
a
decent
amount
of
sticky
lace
as
it
falls
this
one
fits
right
with
what
i
expect
for
the
style
the
nose
has
some
sweat
fermenting
dough
qualities
to
it
with
a
light
and
crisp
noble
hop
playing
behind
it
things
are
pretty
mellow
in
the
aroma
the
flavor
brings
more
prevalence
to
the
herbal
noble
hop
sitting
over
the
slightly
sweet
bready
quality
of
the
malt
it
finishes
with
a
crisp
bitterness
that
hangs
on
beyond
the
final
swallow
of
the
beer
the
mouthfeel
is
on
the
lighter
end
of
moderate
but
with
a
moderate
carbonation
of
very
fine
bubbles
that
really
makes
it
feel
light
the
drinkability
of
this
beer
is
second
to
none
at
4
5
it
is
a
true
session
beer
all
aspects
of
the
brew
are
mellow
but
not
boring
at
all
this
is
a
style
that
needs
to
be
made
by
more
breweries
i
might
be
putting
in
an
order
for
another
50l
of
this
one
sooner
than
later
overall
not
a
bad
beer
by
any
means
its
just
not
something
that
i
would
pay
the
extra
dollarfifty
a
sixer
for
when
i
could
just
drink
some
dos
equis
or
modelo
and
get
the
same
effect
drinkability
is
relatively
high
its
an
easily
sessionable
beer
not
only
due
to
low
abv
but
also
a
small
and
simple
flavor
profile
clean
and
refreshing
yep
its
a
summer
lager
alright
nice
malt
sweetness
of
the
best
simplicty
this
simple
toasted
malt
sweetness
mxies
well
with
a
divining
grass
hops
that
balance
everything
out
to
crisp
yet
sweet
brillance
very
crisp
palate
that
is
refreshing
and
easily
sessionable
with
lots
of
flavor
mouthfeel
is
a
little
heavier
than
a
pilsener
the
spicy
kick
adds
a
new
dimension
to
a
crisp
finish
i
had
this
with
some
spicy
pad
thai
delicious
combo
i
look
forward
to
cracking
open
a
can
after
mowing
the
lawn
side
note
schlafly
tweeted
that
they
are
canning
these
this
summer
it
has
a
wonder
full
deep
golden
colored
body
there
isnt
much
for
bubbles
or
head
there
is
however
a
bit
of
tight
lacing
it
has
an
average
lager
aroma
there
is
nothing
that
special
about
it
there
are
some
grassy
tones
but
that
is
about
it
it
has
a
grainy
and
light
hops
flavor
there
is
a
bit
of
a
corn
tone
to
the
aftertaste
the
mouthfeel
is
light
and
easy
to
drink
pours
a
straw
yellow
with
a
thin
white
head
not
much
in
the
way
of
lacing
as
it
goes
down
the
smell
is
a
bit
of
grassy
malt
with
a
tiny
bit
of
sweetness
there
is
some
citrus
in
there
as
well
this
comes
out
a
little
bit
in
the
taste
along
with
some
noble
hops
the
mouthfeel
is
lightmedium
with
moderate
carbonation
this
was
very
refreshing
on
a
hot
summers
day
this
brewery
had
the
right
idea
when
they
aimed
more
toward
a
munich
helles
than
a
typical
american
summer
ale
for
their
summertime
beer
drinks
pretty
easy
wouldnt
say
this
takes
me
back
to
germany
but
an
alright
american
take
on
the
style
this
beer
pours
a
clear
straw
color
with
a
one
finger
of
sudsy
head
to
it
head
retention
is
quite
good
but
leaves
no
lacing
on
the
glass
nose
is
of
grains
malts
spices
and
a
bit
of
lemon
zest
taste
is
light
malts
up
front
a
bit
of
vanilla
with
a
finish
of
lemn
zest
and
a
touch
of
clove
light
bodied
beer
medium
carbonation
goes
down
easy
and
makes
for
a
nice
summer
sessionable
beer
refreshing
smooth
and
very
drinkable
lightmedium
bodied
a
very
nice
summer
cooler
but
good
enough
to
be
a
year
round
drink
im
really
starting
to
fall
in
love
with
these
munich
helles
lagers
they
are
just
so
good
this
one
is
being
reviewed
from
the
tap
room
on
st
louis
on
of
my
favorite
places
in
the
world
has
a
light
golden
color
with
zero
head
on
it
smell
is
kinda
weak
has
tiny
skunkiness
to
it
like
it
should
taste
is
awesome
has
the
perfect
mixture
of
malt
and
hops
this
beer
has
a
great
mouthfeel
and
even
better
drinkability
it
would
not
be
hard
to
drink
a
lot
of
these
schlafly
needs
to
make
this
very
drinkable
brew
all
year
round
i
could
pound
these
all
night
good
job
schlafly
12oz
bottle
served
in
a
pilsner
glass
poured
a
pale
straw
with
a
quickly
dissipating
head
noble
hops
in
the
nose
with
a
little
sulfur
also
some
bready
malt
decent
base
of
malt
fairly
dry
noble
hops
in
the
finish
very
easy
drinking
this
is
a
great
summer
time
beer
ive
been
drinking
a
lot
at
the
lake
this
summer
d
very
tasty
and
refreshing
just
came
in
from
outside
where
the
temperature
is
95
this
really
hit
the
spot
well
worth
a
try
taste
features
a
bit
of
sweet
fresh
toasted
grain
a
refreshing
lemon
zest
like
citrusy
hops
along
with
a
bit
of
spice
slightly
dry
finish
very
refreshing
and
easy
drinking
on
a
hot
summer
day
a
welcomed
new
edition
to
the
schlafly
seasonal
lineup
its
got
a
very
light
taste
but
there
is
still
a
bit
of
hops
on
the
tongue
i
was
pretty
surprised
with
this
beer
usually
summer
styles
have
a
strong
almost
overpowering
citric
taste
to
them
but
there
was
just
a
hint
of
lemon
and
honey
here
the
overall
effect
was
very
very
good
its
not
a
complex
taste
at
all
but
very
drinkable
and
a
very
solid
choice
for
a
summer
lager
what
a
flavorful
helles
actually
its
bold
enough
with
the
floral
hops
that
it
actually
brings
out
a
fair
amount
of
nectarlike
fruitiness
edges
closely
to
a
super
clean
blonde
ale
the
hop
flavor
saaz
makes
a
remarkable
impact
in
the
nose
and
taste
then
carries
the
beer
deep
into
the
clean
finish
the
hearty
pilsner
malts
give
a
firm
foundation
for
the
hops
and
without
interferring
with
the
delicate
and
perfumy
notes
softly
sweet
and
bready
to
create
a
nice
light
body
and
to
bolster
the
carbonation
to
support
a
lot
of
creaminess
upfront
and
then
dryness
late
definately
a
top
choice
for
the
lawnmower
types
only
a
slight
graininess
and
vegital
note
both
in
the
aroma
and
flavor
keep
this
beer
from
very
high
scores
this
is
a
fine
example
of
a
summer
session
lager
and
what
a
good
time
to
try
it
the
memorial
day
weekend
this
is
an
underrated
style
and
i
am
glad
to
see
more
breweries
attempting
the
helles
lager
this
is
a
perfect
summer
beer
nice
and
light
in
flavor
but
still
has
that
dominant
beer
profile
overall
not
my
favorite
of
the
schlafly
beers
or
maybe
its
just
me
this
entire
winter
i
have
indulged
in
belgians
stouts
and
dopplebocks
really
complex
brews
with
alot
of
flavor
and
alcohol
as
for
this
beer
i
just
dont
feel
it
is
exceptional
or
unique
pours
a
clear
pale
yellow
color
34
inch
head
of
a
white
color
good
retention
and
decent
lacing
smells
of
yeast
cleanliness
pale
malt
and
slight
biscuitgrass
aroma
fits
the
style
of
a
munich
helles
lager
mouth
feel
is
smooth
and
slightly
thick
with
a
higher
than
average
carbonation
level
tastes
of
yeast
cleanliness
noticeable
pale
malt
flavor
really
smooth
finish
but
slightly
reminiscent
of
an
adjunct
without
the
harsh
metallic
aftertaste
overall
a
really
easy
drinking
beer
but
nothing
i
would
drink
unless
its
scorching
out
d
this
is
a
nice
sessionable
lager
not
a
bad
attempt
at
a
german
lager
d
this
is
the
definition
of
a
summer
beer
light
easy
to
drink
and
refreshing
mouthfeel
was
zesty
and
light
to
medium
in
body
aroma
is
toasted
biscuit
on
a
malt
bed
quaff
is
very
grainy
husk
but
still
the
malt
backbone
kicks
in
and
balances
the
dry
finish
the
noble
hops
add
an
unique
grassy
aspect
very
smooth
drinking
lager
this
will
go
over
well
in
the
summer
heat
and
those
looking
for
something
but
the
ab
pilsner
choices
this
looks
like
a
pretty
typical
lager
light
amberyellow
color
not
a
lot
of
body
or
head
i
always
expect
a
salty
flavor
from
a
helles
but
this
one
is
particularly
mild
its
a
good
beer
for
a
hot
summer
day
but
there
is
no
need
to
go
out
of
your
way
to
try
schlaflys
which
is
a
a
shame
because
they
typically
do
a
great
job
d
see
the
last
line
of
above
its
wierd
but
it
really
reminds
me
of
their
kolsch
to
prove
it
i
did
a
sidebyside
its
close
are
they
using
the
kolsch
yeast
for
this
beer
damned
fine
session
beer
even
better
than
their
pils
will
pick
up
a
case
jsut
to
have
around
looks
to
be
a
new
staple
in
the
fridge
for
me
damned
fine
lager
guys
i
had
this
on
tap
yesterday
at
the
main
bar
in
the
tap
room
it
poured
a
clear
straw
colored
gold
with
a
thick
fluffy
white
head
it
presented
a
malt
aroma
with
some
fruity
essence
the
malt
came
across
with
mild
figs
and
dates
and
a
hint
of
caramel
on
the
finish
the
fruit
came
as
just
a
hint
of
pear
on
the
finish
the
flavor
reminded
me
of
a
delicate
maibock
more
subtle
not
as
sweet
something
for
a
hot
weather
day
which
it
is
in
st
louis
it
had
the
sweet
malt
with
light
caramel
and
dates
and
more
fruit
than
i
see
in
bock
beers
in
th
form
of
pear
and
apple
flavors
nice
smooth
mouth
feel
very
drinkable
good
hot
weather
beer
when
poured
into
my
glass
the
head
was
small
sized
and
white
with
finelarge
bubbles
that
quickly
dissipated
the
body
was
carbonated
and
clear
with
a
golden
hue
the
nose
was
malty
and
somewhat
skunky
it
had
a
bitter
flavor
that
left
an
aftertaste
the
mouthfeel
was
tingly
smooth
thin
textured
watery
and
medium
bodied
there
was
virtually
no
lacing
with
this
beer
i
would
rate
this
beer
as
very
drinkable
and
clearly
a
session
brew
it
is
most
reminiscent
of
the
hofbrauhaus
strain
of
helles
and
i
believe
it
could
sub
there
very
easily
clean
crisp
and
clear
are
all
attributes
of
this
offering
clear
light
golden
in
color
with
a
small
white
head
that
doesnt
last
very
long
light
bready
and
flowery
aroma
starts
sweet
and
bready
with
a
hint
of
grains
and
flowery
hop
flavors
light
bodied
somewhat
of
a
thin
and
watery
mouthfeel
finishes
smooth
and
crisp
i
would
say
this
is
an
average
american
helles
lager
o
again
not
half
as
enjoyable
as
its
cheaper
exported
counterpart
i
am
surprised
that
i
like
this
i
drank
it
quite
a
lot
during
my
university
years
in
vienna
but
havent
liked
it
much
since
however
there
is
this
soapiness
that
prevents
me
from
giving
a
higher
score
overall
not
my
favourite
style
ever
but
nonetheless
this
a
decent
examplar
the
score
reflects
personal
taste
more
than
it
does
objective
tostyle
analysis
nice
for
an
airport
beer
poured
goldenrod
yellow
and
lively
from
a
green
bottle
smells
like
nice
german
bready
malts
and
more
of
a
hop
kick
than
ive
been
able
to
enjoy
in
bosnia
flavor
is
big
and
balanced
a
touch
skunky
likely
from
poor
handling
but
there
is
plenty
of
depth
here
with
the
pale
malts
in
the
lead
feel
works
well
lighter
in
body
and
good
carbonation
easy
drinking
and
i
would
have
had
sever
if
airport
prices
were
more
friendly
not
a
bad
beer
all
in
all
overall
a
great
beer
that
went
well
with
a
wiener
schnitzel
at
dinner
as
well
as
a
hot
dog
crammed
into
a
boll
while
walking
the
street
of
vienna
would
love
to
be
able
to
get
my
hands
on
this
here
in
the
states
o
ill
be
honest
the
yellow
can
reminded
of
the
grimbergen
blonde
cans
i
used
to
knock
back
during
my
time
in
paris
this
unfortunately
was
nowhere
near
as
good
dr
fairly
priced
very
easy
to
drink
and
refreshing
as
a
simple
helles
it
does
exactly
what
you
expect
o
i
found
this
to
be
enjoyable
nothing
was
off
putting
about
but
it
did
lack
quite
a
bit
of
flavour
m
d
this
is
where
this
beer
really
shines
there
is
a
foamy
smooth
almost
sticky
soapy
but
not
in
a
bad
way
mouthfeel
that
sticks
to
your
mouth
and
goes
well
with
a
bismarck
herring
sandwich
very
drinkable
would
love
to
try
this
again
but
doubtful
to
find
it
outside
of
austria
d
is
not
something
id
actively
seek
out
to
drink
but
if
it
were
on
offer
and
i
wasnt
paying
then
its
drinkable
had
this
recently
in
vienna
and
reviewing
from
notes
picked
this
one
up
in
can
form
at
a
local
sausage
stand
taste
is
weak
with
a
hint
of
lemon
zest
not
very
good
watery
with
little
flavor
some
grain
and
lemon
at
the
end
i
steered
clear
of
this
one
the
rest
of
my
trip
like
a
bud
light
easy
to
drink
but
why
would
you
want
to
d
quite
drinkable
light
and
you
can
drink
a
lot
of
it
overall
decent
d
an
overly
simplistic
lager
this
is
a
drinking
beer
that
will
come
out
almost
intact
from
the
way
it
went
in
not
something
that
i
would
ever
choose
willingly
this
beer
pour
a
clear
pale
golden
color
the
head
is
small
and
recedes
within
seconds
leaving
no
lacing
the
aroma
is
of
cereal
malt
a
hint
of
noble
hops
and
a
little
skunk
it
was
bottled
in
green
glass
the
taste
is
like
the
aroma
but
without
the
skunkiness
still
it
is
a
rather
dull
taste
the
mouthfeel
is
mediumlight
bodied
with
very
low
carbonation
so
low
that
it
really
adds
to
the
lifelessness
of
this
beer
overall
this
beer
is
mediocre
verging
on
bad
i
will
not
drink
this
again
this
beer
was
not
spectacular
but
a
good
session
brew
and
drinkable
drinkability
a
worthless
brew
not
even
worth
trying
in
my
opinion
maybe
it
was
because
i
had
it
from
a
can
maybe
it
was
because
i
tried
it
on
an
airplane
nevertheless
i
was
entirely
turned
off
by
this
beer
nearly
everything
about
this
beer
is
slight
it
could
so
far
as
im
concerned
never
offend
but
it
is
not
as
crisp
and
cooling
as
i
would
expect
from
a
helles
i
think
my
taste
rating
is
the
one
that
is
skewed
but
i
honestly
would
not
categorize
this
as
average
even
if
it
is
only
slightly

with

moderate
german
style
hop
bitterness
in
the
finish
which
has
a
light
biscuit
malt
character
medium
bodied
with
moderate
carbonation
a
fairly
traditional
helles
lager
with
light
flavor
combining
grains
and
light
sweet
malt
nothing
exciting
but
a
solid
lager
o
this
is
decent
represention
of
the
style
but
seemed
like
it
could
have
used
a
little
more
in
the
way
of
hops
to
strike
a
balance
with
the
malts
light
body
and
a
clean
malty
flavor
with
just
a
hint
of
hoppy
spiciness
the
beer
is
nice
and
sweet
with
low
bitterness
the
noble
hops
at
midpalate
mix
with
the
malt
and
infuse
an
applelike
flavor
into
the
beer
very
pleasant
and
easydrinking
but
lacks
any
malt
complexity
a
beer
to
be
enjoyed
with
a
meal
not
much
more
o
got
this
off
the
shelf
of
a
largely
reputable
smallchain
liquor
store
in
the
chicago
area
cant
tell
by
the
dating
code
how
old
this
is
have
to
look
into
it
but
im
just
a
little
disappointed
at
how
off
this
beer
is
this
is
a
good
beer
for
the
guy
wanting
to
try
something
different
its
not
far
from
bud
or
coors
in
style
but
amazingly
better
and
tastier
o
a
damn
good
lager
plenty
of
taste
yet
extremely
refreshing
a
great
representation
of
the
style
based
on
the
small
amount
of
reviews
here
doesnt
seem
to
be
a
lot
of
this
going
around
but
if
you
still
see
this
stuff
any
quality
lager
fan
should
grab
this
not
great
not
bad
poured
from
a
porcelain
top
bottle
this
bright
yellow
brew
clung
briefly
to
the
side
of
my
glass
refreshing
and
crisp
it
is
pleasing
to
the
taste
and
nose
the
head
as
mentioned
quickly
dissipates
but
still
not
bad
better
than
most
i
would
gladly
drink
this
again
although
i
would
not
search
it
out
drinkability
easy
and
quite
appealing
more
than
originally
anticipated
the
beer
had
a
light
feel
to
it
the
beer
was
clean
and
smooth
overall
not
a
bad
beer
but
certainly
not
the
best
representation
of
the
style
i
doubt
that
i
will
pick
this
one
up
again
this
isnt
a
must
try
beer
d
pretty
high
think
it
cost
3
50
and
cap
n
cork
id
do
it
again
though
id
like
to
try
it
on
tap
to
compare
some
of
the
flavors
that
may
have
to
do
with
bottling
and
transport
the
aroma
is
subtle
powdery
light
minerals
the
flavor
is
full
for
a
lager
im
not
terribly
familiar
with
munich
helles
lagers
but
im
quite
impressed
by
the
flavor
theres
definitely
a
european
ness
to
this
beer
i
couldnt
really
feel
the
alcohol
in
this
and
even
though
the
bottle
was
a
pint
serving
i
could
have
had
a
few
of
these
during
the
course
of
a
drinking
session
with
some
lighter
bread
or
fruit
this
would
pair
well
with
it
and
although
its
not
the
best
beer
ive
had
lately
i
dont
think
that
anyone
could
be
disappointed
with
this
at
all
d
good
drinkability
a
summertime
lager
with
a
clean
malty
body
and
noble
green
hopping
i
come
to
expect
per
style
a
good
intro
beer
for
friends
into
the
world
of
craft
and
lagershelles
as
it
is
not
overbearing
and
fairly
easy
to
handle
but
with
much
better
flavor
and
fulfillment
then
your
typical
american
adjunct
d
moderately
high
i
could
down
a
few
of
these
some
good
flavors
in
this
one
no
idea
what
the
availabilityprice
is
but
id
buy
a
few
if
i
saw
em
im
not
a
big
fan
of
the
german
lagers
but
this
one
was
excellent
not
bad
its
a
lager
and
it
works
for
it
was
meant
for
no
complaints
taste
is
similar
a
very
nice
solid
helles
character
with
some
firm
elements
but
thin
and
simple
compared
to
the
best
it
has
grain
lightly
raisiny
alcohol
light
apple
simple
but
firm
tinglyzesty
herbs
a
nice
spritzyjuicy
hint
of
lemon
carbonation
is
on
the
lower
side
feel
is
decent
firm
but
not
great
not
watery
but
on
the
thinner
side
not
lively
and
rather
nondescript
drinkability
is
pretty
high
the
beer
pours
a
yellow
color
with
a
white
head
the
aroma
is
grain
and
some
grassy
hops
the
flavor
is
grain
wheat
and
grassy
hops
medium
mouthfeel
and
medium
carbonation
there
is
nothing
wrong
with
this
beer
it
is
just
not
too
exciting
a
malty
finish
with
a
hint
of
aspirin
from
perhaps
being
a
little
too
long
in
the
bottle
for
my
preference
over
six
months
this
german
lager
gets
all
the
details
right
light
fluffy
head
floating
over
straw
to
honey
slightly
clouded
liquid
gold
the
head
is
fluff
of
microscopic
bubbles
that
fade
to
light
lacing
a
smell
of
bread
and
yeast
that
yields
to
a
malty
sweetness
with
just
a
hint
of
herb
from
the
hops
the
taste
is
classic
and
rich
certainly
wont
satisfy
any
palate
looking
for
a
hoppy
shot
but
this
classic
lager
is
rich
and
buttery
with
lots
of
flavor
for
bier
thats
gone
through
laggered
fermentation
helles
full
beer
rather
than
hefe
half
rich
buttery
mouthfeel
very
drinkable
repeatable
lovely
drinkable
but
thats
about
it
a

lager
from

it
would
definitely
kick
more
ass
on
tap
and
at
the
price
of
a
bottle

certainly
worth
your
money
slainte
a
really

inexpensive
lager
to
be

until
i
took
a
sip
a
great
deal
and
ffo

d
overall
i
felt
the
beer
was
just

wasnt

great
its
very
easy
to
drink
at
5
abv
and
not
bad
at
all
but
nothing
i
would
seek
out
again
this
is
not
a
beer
id
care
to
have
again
there

out

a
very
drinkable
and
satisfying
lighter
lager
that
wont
make
you
feel
bloated
nicely
balanced
and
grounded
but
it
wont
knock
your

it
pours
a
clean
looking
golden
yellow
with
a
shortlived
fizzy
white
head
and
bubbly
carbonation
the
aroma
clearly
gives
away
its
german
origin
with
the
expected
malt
bready
and
barley
combination
the
taste
also
had
a
strong
note
of
malts
but
it
was
a
little
on
the
sour
side
fairly
typical
for
its
style
but
nothing
exciting
very
easydrinker
a

lager
without

better
than
expected
drinkability
i
have
to
disagree
with
most
of
the
middlerange
scores
given
to
this
beer
thus
far
i
really
enjoyed
this
offering
and
put
it
in

had

i
would
gladly
drink
this
one
again
a
good
beer
but
not
a
standout
a
bit
more
crispness
in
body
and
a
cleaner
taste
without
the
cornlike
sweetness

the
beer
may
be
able

stand

is

pretty
nice

for

definitely
flavorful
a
suitable
for
the
style
well
worth
the
4
pack
that
it
came
in
overall
this
beer
is
exceptionally
easy
to
drink
and
should
be
drunk
often
possibly
one
of
the
best
lagers
that
i
have
ever
tried
take
the
rating
of
this
one
with
a
grain
of
salt
i
am
sure
it
is
a
lot
better
when
it
is
fresh
this
bottle
obviously
is
not
fresh
dry
crisp
clean
finish
i
havent
had
many
helles
lagers
so
i
dont
know
how
this
compares
to
others
but
i
didnt
much
enjoy
this
one
and
wont
be
seeking
it
out
again
light
bodied
with
a
little
carbonation
great
drinkability
classic
german
taste
all
i
can
say
is
i
loved
this
lager
d
very
drinkable
and
well
made
the
malt
character
is
rich
and
intense
with
enough
noble
hops
to
keep
it
balanced
this
is
a
really
excellent
example
of
the
style
and
one
that
seems
to
have
held
up
well
despite
the
long
trip
from
germany
o
being
my
first
from
this
style
it
didnt
impress
me
not
really
into
lagers
anyways
definitely
a
easy
drinking
beer
low
abv
no
bitterness
and
easy
on
the
palate
flavors
make
it
an
easy
session
beer
o
delicous
if
you
dont
drink
lagers
then
you
can
not
identify
but
i
agree
with
the
bros
on
this
solid
a
lager
no
doubt
a
middling
effort
all
around
pours
a
clear
pale
yellow
with
a
few
dense
fingers
of
head
sticky
lace
and
moderate
retention
to
style
i
guess
nose
of
slightly
sweet
grain
mild
floral
hops
and
not
a
ton
else
going
on
taste
is
similar
and
tame
some
subtle
noble
hops
a
dominant
pale
malt
and
a
weird
slimy
film
that
lingered
on
my
mouth
and
palate
for
a
while
definitely
not
attractive
at
all
did
something
go
wrong
decent
mouthfeel
when
i
got
used
to
that
medium
low
carbonation
kinda
drinkable
i
guess
wasnt
a
big
fan
i
really
have
to
stress
that
this
was
not
a
poortasting
brew
its
quite
flavorful
and
has
most
of
the
things
im
looking
for
in
a
munich
helles
however
the
poor
appearance
and
lifeless
body
reveal
one
of
two
things
that
neuschwansteiner
doesnt
ship
well
to
ontario
and
hopefully
tastes
better
in
its
native
southern
germany
or
this
beer
is
simply
not
among
the
brewerys
best
since
i
so
enjoyed
their
bock
and
hefeweizen
imports
im
going
to
lean
towards
the
latter
neuschwansteiner
is
not
your
fairytale
lager
but
it
does
have
a
happy
ending
in
that
in
the
end
i
was
very
happy
to
have
drunk
it
all
of
the
hirschbrau
products
ive
had
have
been
more
than
passable
and
while
they
havent
exactly
exhibited
the
quality
or
craftsmanship
for
which
german
breweries
are
renown
they
have
showcased
just
how
agreeable
and
wholesome
their
styles
tend
to
be
and
indeed
this
is
both
those
things
overall
tasty
but
nothing
special
a
bit
too
much
on
the
sweet
side
d
i
wouldnt
seek
this
out
but
i
enjoyed
the
bottle
i
had
nice
and
refreshing
and
decently
flavourful
drink
just
an
average
beer
its
highly
drinkable
but
nothing
worth
seeking
out
mouthfeel
is
light
bodied
with
low
to
medium
carbonation
drinkable
a
decent
lager
but
quite
plain
and
unexciting
pours
a
crystal
clear
pale
gold
colour
with
a
big
creamy
white
head
the
leaves
some
lacing
picking
up
lots
of
sweet
grain
in
the
nose
as
well
as
some
grassy
notes
the
taste
is
a
mixture
of
bready
malt
and
noble
hops
the
sweet
malt
flavours
assert
themselves
a
little
more
and
tend
to
dominate
the
aftertaste
is
surprisingly
crisp
and
clean
lightbodied
with
a
soft
carbonation
that
lends
a
creamy
mouthfeel
i
found
this
to
be
a
bit
too
sweet
and
lacking
complexity
but
not
a
bad
beer
overall
feels
light
and
crisp
with
soft
carbonation
leaves
the
mouth
feeling
lightly
oiled
between
sips
balanced
and
clean
this
is
a
very
easy
drinking
beer
id
be
happy
to
session
on
this
if
it
were
available
on
its
own
in
ontario
instead
of
as
part
of
3piece
gift
set
easy
drinker
very
good
bought
as
part
of
a
3
bottle

from
the

board
in

pours
a
clear
straw
yellow
with
huge
white
head
and
some
nice
lacing
smells
of
grassy
hops
with
some
grainy
malts
flavour
has
a
mild
bitterness
but
some
good
sweetness
very
smooth
mouthfeel
a
really
nice
lager
not
really
that
good
in
my
opinion
nothing
exciting
in
the
flavor
mouthfeel
is
light
bodied
and
smooth
but
could
definitely
use
more
carbonation
this
ties
into
the
tightening
up
i
mentioned
earlier
its
very
close
to
being
great
but
not
quite
there
id
reccomend
this
to
a
german
lager
fan
if
you
know
its
fresh
its
a
tasty
beer
that
i
would
have
again
a
bit
dead
in
the
glass
quenching
and
balanced
but
no
great
shakes
allinall
a
pretty
good
rendition
of
a
sweetish
standard
refreshing
helles
lager
d
this
is
a
pleasant
helles
lager
but
its
a
bit
roughly
grainy
and
slightly
metallic
still
this
is
a
bright
perky
brew
that
holds
up
pretty
well
and
has
a
bit
of
character
it
works
great
as
a
session
beer
and
is
the
perfect
substitute
for
the
average
macrolagers
da
like
i
said
a
tad
boring
and
a
little
too
sweet
without
enough
complexity
in
the
malt
profile
its
still
good
though
the
drink
is
lightmedium
in
body
with
just
the
right
amount
of
carbonation
highly
drinkable
mouth
of
grains
cookies
some
honey
not
complex
yet
its
something
about
it
that
i
really
like
maybe
the
freshness
and
full
body
absolutely
drinkable
d
this
beer
is
mixed
bag
some
of
the
elements
are
definitely
well
done
but
the
taste
simply
didnt
have
enough
complexity
to
satisfy
me
a
very
sessionable
beer
but
at
3
per
bottle
it
wont
qualify
solid
offering
and
a
good
example
of
a
germanbavarian
lager
1081
overall
straige
across
an
average
beer
drinkable
but
nothing
to
write
home
about
picked
this
up
at
a
local
shop
the
label
says
neuschwansteiner
bavarian
lager
i
went
to
their
website
to
make
sure
this
was
the
same
beer
and
the
labels
matched
so
im
sure
that
it
is
great
appearance
for
this
one
a
light
pale
yellow
with
thin
white
head
lots
of
lacing
and
an
impressive
carbonation
the
steady
upflow
of
bubbles
kept
me
entertained
for
a
long
time
the
aroma
is
faint
and
subtle
slightly
malty
and
a
bit
hoppy
it
had
the
common
fragrance
only
toned
down
average
mouthfeel
the
taste
is
delivered
nicely
slightly
malty
and
traces
of
hops
with
a
grainy
finish
this
beer
is
extraordinarilly
crisp
and
smooth
the
mild
flavor
is
quite
enjoyable
great
classic
example
for
this
style
im
iffy
on
the
style
but
i
can
say
for
certain
that
the
beer
is
mediocre
and
rather
unimpressive
the
lack
of
malt
is
irksome
as
is
the
exceedingly
light
hops
not
one
ill
get
again
the
taste
is
malty
up
front
then
becomes
very
wet
like
biting
into
a
ripe
fruit
mild
hop
bitterness
on
the
end
in
the
mouth
it
is
thin
and
leaves
a
light
touch
on
the
tongue
overall
a
very
excellent
lager
much
more
to
it
than
the
american
lagers
i
have
tried
dthis
would
be
very
drinkable
on
tap
or
by
the
six
pack
but
at
3
00
a

probably
wont
see
this
one
again
for
a
while
d
i
could
easily
drink
this
all
night
this
a
very
drinkable
beer
with
great
flavor
and
body
very
drinkable
beer
great
beer
and
the
swingtop
gives
the
added
bonus
of
reusable
bottles
for
homebrew
it
took
a
vigorous
poor
to
produce
the
foamy
half
inch
thick
white
head
unfortunately
it
took
longer
to
pour
the
straw
colored
beer
then
it
did
for
the
head
to
fade
mildly
sweet
aroma
of
black
tea
and
purple
grapes
neutral
malt
flavor
and
undertones
of
grapes
in
the
flavor
the
flavors
just
vanish
in
the
finish
the
body
is
on
the
light
side
of
moderately
full
and
there
is
a
bit
of
fine
carbonation
to
add
to
the
mouthfeel
its

for
a
lager
but
thats
my
only
complaint
not
that
there
is
anything
good
to
say
about
this
beer
either
i
was
not
too
impressed
with
this
one
the
appearance
is
rivaled
by
bud
light
and
there
is
almost
more
taste
to
a
bud
light
also
very
little
head
that
lasted
a
matter
of
seconds
and
subsided
very
quickly
the
smell
kind
of
reminds
me
of
white
grape
juice
full
bodied
slick
on
the
tongue
and
palate
a
decent
beer
overall
not
sure
i
would
get
this
again
but
i
was
pleased
with
this
offering
the
label
looks
a
bit
like
made
for
american
tourists
visiting
germany
pardon
my
european
view
the
smell
of
ripe
hops
gives
some
promise
which
unfortunately
is
not
met
by
the
content
to
me
this
tastes
like
a
pretty
bland
export
and
doesnt
reflect
any
kind
of
350years
family
tradition
label
pr
rather
disappointing
for
the
price
i
paid
for
this
pours
almost
a
clear
straw
gold
its
just
slightly
hazy
nose
is
like
slightly
cooked
grains
flavor
is
slightly
cereal
sweet
just
slightly
even
though
this
is
a
lager
and
lacks
any
huge
punch
in
the
flavor
department
the
flavor
profile
kicks
ass
just
a
nice
smooth
and
even
flavor
feel
is
great
nice
and
smooth
with
a
good
carbonation
to
it
extremely
drinkable
sure
it
is
a
lager
hey
you
know
people
dont
have
as
much
love
for
this
style
because
it
is
not
big
and
bodied
but
its
pretty
damn
good
i
enjoyed
this
more
than
the
doppel
usually
this
isnt
my
favorite
style
but
if
aromatic
enough
ill
go
for
it
this
was
extremely
drinkable
and
i
positively
want
more
drinkability
great
easily
a
quaffable
beer
that
will
get
you
through
many
a
long
nights
very
refreshing
lager

renews

interest

i
dig
the
drinkability
as
very
good
yes
indeed
i
do
enjoy
a
good

this
one
fits
the

the

a
quality
product
it
is
but
can
be
boring
after
more
than
half
a
pint
as
happened
to
me
but
i
guess
its
simply
because
this
is
not
one
of
my
favourite
beer
style
poured
a
very
clear
golden
color
with
a

faded

tastes
of

some

lots
of

highly
drinkable
due
to
the
lightness
of
this
brew
im
just
not

im
into
big

and
this
just
doesnt
cut
it
for
me
drinkability
while
a
bit
unusual
in
its
flavor
profile
this
beer
is
not
that
compelling
to
me
in
my
next
bavarian
trip
i
might
hunt
this
brewer
out
as
mentioned
nice
and
creamy
with
just
the
right
carbonation
to
avoid
unwanted
tangy
sensations
the
flavors
are
carried
along
in

is

the

more

in

very

i
pick
up
something
a

not

in
anyway
i
do
believe
this
is
my
first
stab
at
this
style
maybe
not
ive
got
to
say
that
this
is
not
the
best
lager
ive
had
in
the
last
two
weeks
its
just
not
as
crisp
and
clean
tasting
as
some
of
the
others
available
i
gave
it
a
3
5
for
drinkability
the
smell
subsided
and
a
sweeter
smell
evolved
pretty
much
a
solid
brew
crisp
and
clean
smooth
rounded
but
lacking
in
taste
not
unpleasant
though
slightly
creamy
would
love
to
drink
this
one
again
ice
cold
at
a
hot
summer
barbecue
or
tomorrow
night
had
this
on
draft
at
sushi
restaurant
in
west
hartford
a
very
satisfying
cleanly
made
golden
lager
carbonation
level
was
great
held
a
nice
head
throughout
most
of
it
and
was
a
great
pairing
with
the
sushi
could
have
been
served
colder
but
thats
not
the
beers
fault
overall
among
the
better
new
england
golden
lagers
on
the
market
o
i
can
drink
a
lot
of
this
too
many
i
have
never
had
any
other
beers
of
this
style
but
this
particular
one
reminds
me
of
a
american
light
lager
with
flavor
way
more
flavor
and
complexity
especially
given
its
clear
and
light
appearance
while
the
body
is
light
in
color
it
has
some
depth
as
the
spritzy
carbonation
fades
a
sweet
and
rounded
caramel
sweetness
emerges
providing
a
slick
and
refreshing
gulpable
brew
lots
of
flavors
for
a
fairly
small
beer
on
the
palate
this
lager
is
almost
exactly
what
i
expected
crisp
clean
and
easydrinking
theres
a
touch
of
malty
sweetness
up
front
which
just
a
slightly
dry
finish
on
the
backside
a
deliciously
balanced
brew
i
now
know
why
this
munich
style
lager
is
ranked
so
highly
on
beeradvocate
why
did
i
not
try
this
one
sooner
very
easy
drinking
and
low
abv
i
highly
recommend
this
one
nicely
done
a
straightforward
representation
of
the
style
that
was
the
perfect
compliment
to
a
gorgeous
august
afternoon
im
not
sure
ive
ever
seen
this
on
tap
in
boston
but
i
wouldnt
hesitate
to
order
it
again
given
the
chance
o
nice
lager
has
a
good
amount
of
flavor
without
being
too
complex
or
challenging
seems
like
a
really
solid
summer
session
beer
cheers
d
very
drinkable
great
beer
all
around
great
beer
for
the
summeroutdoors
pour
yields
a
good
white
head
of
foam
and
some
spotty
lacing
on
the
way
down
the
nose
brings
a
nice
subtle
noble
hoppiness
plus
light
grain
and
a
bit
of
bread
excellent
balance
between
all
the
components
the
flavor
is
very
nice
as
well
with
a
good
lightlysweetened
malt
presence
and
a
good
level
of
hop
flavor
and
bitterness

cut
through
the

thomas

seriously
knows
how
to
make
lagers
great
way
to
say
cheers
drinkability
ive
quite
enjoyed
this
beer
and
found
it
quite
drinkable
each
sip
has
followed
quite
easily
from
the
last
and
it
was
quite
easy
to
have
a
second
one
ill
certainly
be
happy
to
have
this
beer
again
and
am
glad
to
have
tried
it
when
i
had
the
chance
this
beer
is
my
new
favorite
i
got
this
beer
at
a
beer
tasting
at
the
thomas
hooker
brewery
in
bloomfield
ct
the
beer
was
really
fresh
with
a
nice
golden
appearance
this
beer
tastes
great
and
is
perfect
for
summer
days
id
recommend
this
beer
to
anyone
who
likes
really
light
colored
beers
d
very
drinkable
great
for
outdoors
d
as
the
style
was
intended
this
beer
is
highly
drinkable
nice
flavor
and
smooth
i
could
drink
these
one
after
another
all
night
long
these
will
be
a
staple
in
my
fridge
all
summer
long
dnot
bad
a
decent
simple
straight
forward
lager
decent
flavour
overall
i
like
the
fruitiness
in
the
background
whether
intended
or
not
poured
a
nice
carbonated
golden
hue
into
an
american
pint
glass
with
a
finger
of
white
head
and
decent
lacing
the
smell
was
decidedly
malty
but
i
could
also
detect
a
bitter
balancing
hop
presence
the
taste
was
better
than
expected
certainly
a
heap
of
malt
in
this
one
but
also
some
caramel
and
toffee
flavor
mixed
with
some
hop
bitter
dryness
and
finishing
on
a
dry
note
very
nice
carbonated
mediumbodied
mouthfeel
very
good
session
beer
aroma
reminds
me
of
freshly
baked
sweetbread
very
nice
taste
is
definetly
malt
oriented
dominated
by
bready
and
slightly
toasty
malt
flavors
with
a
faint
grassy
hop
presence
lurking
in
the
background
full
mouthfeel
with
slightly
lower
than
average
carbonation
seems
to
enhance
the
malty
flavors
of
this
brew
without
hampering
the
drinkability
one
of
my
favorites
from
hooker
drinkability
excellent
a
fantastic
refreshing
session
beer
i
dont
know
how
it
use
to
be
before
conn
turned
on
hooker
for
the
direction
they
took
but
it
could
work
with
a
little
tuning
i
still
drank
it
pretty
fast
just
eager
to
clear
the
fridge
for
some
other
stuff
i
suppose
d
not
bad
but
a
little
too
heavy
on
the
butter
flavor
unfortunately
not
overly
crisp
either
the
diacetyl
really
detracted
from
my
overall
enjoyment
of
this
otherwise
tasty
style
wasnt
too
impressed
honestly
nothing
really
stuck
out
with
this
one
besides
the
drinkability
wouldnt
go
out
of
my
way
to
find
this
but
would
have
it
again
if
i
came
across
it
ontap
taste
is
smooth
and
citrusy
bready
with
a
zing
good
carbonation
especially
considering
quite
buttery
its
clear
light
gold
in
the
glass
with
a
short
white
head
the
aroma
immediately
hits
me
with
spicy
grassy
euro
hops
with
bready
malts
in
the
background
the
flavor
is
spot
on
for
the
style
with
a
mix
of
biscuit
and
light
toast
paired
evenly
with
gentle
but
spicy
hops
while
this
beer
isnt
drastically
different
from
other
helles
lagers
in
terms
of
the
flavors
present
i
believe
it
stands
out
because
everything
is
so
rich
as
a
whole
this
beer
is
drinkable
yet
more
aromatic
and
fullflavored
than
many
of
the
best
in
this
style
drinkability
its
just
a
simple
golden
lager
but
hell
if
it
isnt
highly
drinkable
overall
it
was
just
a
nice
refreshing
light
beer
that
would
make
a
nice
choice
for
a
summer
lager
session
beer
i
thought
it
just
came
in
those
expensive
swing
top
bottles
but
its
nice
to
see
that
it
now
comes
in
a
22
oz
bomber
bottle
d
a
great
semisweet
malted
lager
that
was
crisp
clean
and
left
you
waiting
for
the
next
sip
hooker
has
had
some
nice

beer
enjoyed
this
one
i
am
not
typically
a
fan
of
lager
beers
i
tend
to
prefer
ales
and
heavier
beers
but
i
find
myself
drawn
to
this
particular
lager
first
of
all
it
is
very
drinkable
no
aftertaste
not
very
heavy
but
not
too
light
either
color
is
a
dark
deep
gold
hue
does
not
seem
to
hold
much
carbonation
or
form
much
head
would
be
nicer
if
it
did
so
i
dinged
it
a
bit
for
appearance
i
cant
explain
the
smell
but
i
like
it
taste
is
a
bit
bland
but
very
pleasant
in
all
this
is
for
me
a
very
solid
lager
and
one
i
would
choose
over
many
other
lagers
i
think
thomas
hooker
is
an
underrated
brewery
this
one
pours
a
tinted
gold
hue
with
a
pillowy
two
finger
white
head
that
slowly
dies
down
to
a
solid
layer
little
to
no
stickiness
with
bubbles
racing
to
the
top
throughout
the
entire
tasting
smell
is
of
big
noble
hops
pepper
butter
and
some
faint
caramel
malt
probably
the
best
smelling
lager
ive
ever
sampled
clean
buttery
biscuit
flavors
up
front
with
some
pepper
and
spice
emerging
midway
aftertaste
is
very
weak
and
almost
fades
away
to
nothing
but
a
bit
of
a
hop
bite
lingers
mouthfeel
is
a
creamy
medium
body
with
a
good
amount
of
carbonation
what
a
great
lager
i
really
wish
this
was
available
in
central
new
york
because
this
could
easily
become
my
staple
summer
beer
if
youre
someone
who
appreciates
a
solid
lager
definitely
get
your
hands
on
this
one
pours
a
nice
cleanclear
golden
yellow
color
nice

nice
onefinger
plus
foamy
head
some
sticky
lacing
follows
the
nose
is

some

and
some

the
taste
is
sweet
malty
slightly
spicy
and
some
caramel
thrown
in
medium
body
very
drinkable
this
is
another
awesome
brew
from
thomas
hooker
they
do
a
helles
justice
recommended
i
know
that
some
of
the
swingtop
bottles
are
off
so
if
you
get
a
bad
one
youll
know
it
from
the

this
style
is
underappreciated

favorites

lacing
fooled
me

it

did
the

was

of

with

with

first

nose
hits
were
that
of
a
dank
basement
and
wet
wood
but
towards
the
last
couple
fingers
i
stuck
my
nose
right
in
the
glass
and
it
came
back
as
a
watered
down
rubbing
alchohol
strange
taste
was
immediately
sweet
and
floral
citrus
onthe
front
with
an
ever
so
mellow
hop
finish
slightly
bitter
great
balance
between
malts
and
hops
mouthfeel
was
on
the
side
of
a
cream

full
body
and
surprisingly
smooth
considering
the
amount
of
busy
little
bubbles
that
danced
throughout
the
sitting
the
first
time
i
tasted
this
i
knew
i
fouhd
a
winner
so
i
went
out
and
bought
a
case

of
the
1
9

flip

bottles
ouch

and
change
really
hope
that
curt
and
the
boys
at
troutbrook
get
away
from
the
fancy
expensive
bottling
and
release
this
in
12

love
everything
about
this
except
the
price

you
as
you
get
to
the
end
friends
seemed
to
like
this
quite
a
bit
but
i
couldnt
see
the
attraction
its
ok
reasonably
refreshing
but
just
not
crispy
enough
for
my
tastes
in
this
style
hooker
is
excellent
as
a
rule
so
it
may
be
me
more
than
the
beer
just
not
my
style
munich
style
golden
lager
is
a
delicious
version
of
this
often
overlooked
style
its
the
best
domestic
munich
helles
that
ive
had
and
is
easily
the
equal
of
the
also
exceptional

scthaden
a
good
beer
nice
taste
profile
and
relatively
light
poured
out
of
a
22oz
standard
bomber
poured
a
slightly
cloudy
golden
with
an
excellent
fluffy
white
head
but
no
real
lacing
retention
was
decent
the
aroma
was
quite
light
and
slightly
dusty
sweet
cream
and
lager
yeast
were
predominant
the
taste
was
better
with
tangy
malt
and
a
crisp
typical
lager
flavor
with
some
apple
on
the
finish
the
mouthfeel
is
creamy
and
delicious
good
matched
body
for
the
style
a
little
heft
but
not
enough
to
overwhelm
pretty
nice
ive
really
enjoyed
all
the
german
styles
from
this
brewery
this
was
pretty
good
a
lager
lovers
lager
as
i
said
it
is
what
it
is
by
no
means
a
taste
bomb
but
yet
a
nice
clean
interesting
lager
could
be
paired
with
a
lot
of
food
styles
but
they
would
all
have
to
be
simple
nonspicy
fare
or
it
would
overwhelm
it
a
nice
change
of
pace
id
recommend
it
and
drink
it
again
give
it
a
shot
note
not
a
big
fan
of
the
swingtop
this
beer
was
bumped
by
another
beer
in
the
fridge
and
it
opened
up
a
bit
give
me
the
traditional
cap
anyday
medium
bodied
creamy
and
easy
to
drink
d
it
is
pretty
good
for
the
style
not
one
of
my
favorite
styles
but
it
is
drinkable
a
refreshing
balance
of
flavor
and
lightness
of
body
makes
this
a
really
nice
choice
for
a
multipurpose
beer
theres
nothing
in
there
that
should
put
off
one
who
loves
pabst
and
plenty
to
enjoy
for
those
that
dig
more
challenging
brews
the
price
of
a
500ml
bottle
makes
this
a
once
in
awhile
occasion
but
if
in
six
pack
form
under
10
yes
yes
yes
a
tremendous
helles
with
balanced
flavor
and
texture
troutbrook
did
a
nice
job
bringing
some
exciting
flavor
aspects
to
a
pretty
mundane
style
a
nice
session
lager
for
springtime
when
the
weather
turns
a
bit
warmer
was
able
to
pick
this
up
on
a
recent
trip
to
ct
actually
surprised
that
it
made
it
this
long
the
brew
poured
to
a
clear
golden
color
with
a
slight
white
head
that
broke
down
quite
quickly
but
did
leave
a
little
lacing
at
the
top
of
the
glass
the
aroma
seems
to
be
very
doughy
with
a
mix
of
grassy
notes
the
taste
is
very
smooth
malt
characteristics
stand
out
giving
it
a
toasted
flavor
and
ends
with
just
a
light
hop
flavor
that
rounds
it
out
very
well
at
5
3
abv
this
is
a
nice
session
brew
would
be
fantastic
during
the
warmer
months
i
would
think
overall
a
good
offering
from
troutbrook
this
one
is
a
pretty
regular
offering
at
the
cambridge
house
in
granby
ct
which
is
where
i
have
had
it
i
very
much
like
helles
beers
in
general
and
this
one
is
quite
good
in
the
bottle
however
it
excels
on
draft
the
mouthfeel
is
much
softer
which
makes
the
drinkability
excellent
the
appearance
smell
and
taste
are
on
style
if
you
like
this
in
the
bottle
seek
it
out
on
draft
it
is
worth
it
this
is
a
nice
treat
once
in
a
while
i
wouldt
drink
many
of
these
but
find
it
very
refreshing
the
aroma
is
a
rich
grainy
thing
that
smells
a
bit
like
bread
and
wheat
husks
but
with
a
faintly
dusty
note
the
body
is
bright
gold
and
holds
a
fluffy
but
mildly
bubbly
white
head
grain
accented
fore
is
hearty
and
yet
still
light
on
the
tongue
tastes
like
a
baked
wheat
cake
with
notes
of
barley
and
oats
that
flavor
gives
it
a
thicker
feel
than
the
liquid
itself
possesses
very
light
mostly
floral
hops
with
a
slightly
salty
finish
drinkability
not
being
a
lager
drinker
this
is
not
one
of
my
favorite
styles
however
this
is
a
very
well
made
example
of
a
munich
helles
pours
a
gorgeous
gold
in
body
with
a
sticky
bright
white
head
and
constant
upward
carbonation
bubbles
almost
perfect
aroma
is
a
different
story
with
not
much
there
only
some
slight
cereal
notes
on
the
palate
clean
and
clear
with
some
nice
fruit
to
the
malts
sweet
berries
and
a
finish
thats
just
shy
of
dry
but
long
and
buzzy
nonetheless
mouthfeel
features
zippy
carbonation
and
a
good
weight
for
the
style
substantial
but
not
heavy
this
is
a
very
good
very
drinkable
brew
one
of
the
better
hooker
beers
i
would
say
cheers
wow
not
being
a
big
fans
of
lagers
did
not
know
what
to
expect
but
was
very
impressed
heard
the
munich
lager
was
unbelievable
on
tap
and
they
were
definetly
right
there
was
not
to
much
a
presence
on
the
hops
to
take
away
from
the
overall
taste
and
smell
poured
a
beautiful
yelloworange
color
but
with
very
little
head
would
definetly
get
it
on
tap
again
if
of
course
you
can
find
it
on
tap
actually
was
sitting
next
to
the
brewer
from
hooker
at
the
time
paul
so
that
just
made
it
special
too
for
some
reason
more
bitter
than
the
nose
would
indicate
there
is
an
herbal
hop
presence
dominating
until
midsip
when
the
beer
has
warmed
sufficiently
to
allow
a
mild
malt
sweetness
to
creep
into
being
mouthfeel
is
moderately
smooth
with
decent
carbonation
levels
though
it
is
a
little
thin
balance
is
what
this
lager
is
all
about
hits
the
spot
on
a
hot
summer
evening
but
would
be
damn
tasty
anytime
great
hot
day
drinking
d
this
is
the
kind
of
beer
that
is
drinkable
because
its
got
some
flavor
to
it
but
it
isnt
overpowering
its
not
very
filling
at
all
and
goes
down
quite
easily
one
of
those
beers
that
you
forget
youre
drinking
i
think
this
beer
can
best
be
described
as
how
a
micro
does
macro
it
was
pretty
good
but
not
out
of
the
ordinary
the
beer
is
a
bit
overcarbonated
for
the
medium
to
mediumlight
body
resulting
in
too
much
foaming
on
the
palate
while
this
does
not
make
the
beer
terribly
unpleasant
to
drink
it
doesnt
encourage
further
sipping
either
overalll
nothing
truly
distinguishing
about
this
lager
no
aspect
is
that
far
from
average
but
without
any
particular
strengths
or
aspects
of
the
beer
blending
well
such
as
a
solid
maltiness
mixed
with
a
present
but
ephemeral
hop
nuance
theres
no
reason
to
return
to
it
drinkability
was
average
decenty
made
but
very
boring
imho
ill
stick
with
the
bigger
brews
from
this
phenomenal
brewery
895
vibrant
pour
generating
a
tall
eggshell
colored
head
of
loosely
packed
small
and
medium
bubbles
the
head
is
slow
to
settle
and
leaves
no
lacing
brassy
gold
with
tons
of
jetting
carbonation
streams
the
smell
is
clean
and
slightly
husky
with
some
grassy
hops
the
taste
is
sweet
and
husky
also
a
bit
grainy
with
a
gentle
spicy
hop
finish
nice
and
well
meshed
not
dominant
in
any
one
area
medium
bodied
and
light
on
the
tongue
with
moderate
carbonation
refreshing
and
enjoyable
this
was
a
nice
beer
if
just
a
touch
sweet
quite
drinkable
and
an
easy
suggestion
for
new
craft
drinkers
n
b
served
way
too
cold
on
draft
not
sure
what
effect
this
had
this
is
very
drinkable
stuff
i
will
buy
this
again
was
a
bargain
at
3

for
a
bomber
drinkabilityflavorful
and
easy
to
drinkwould
be
even
better
in
the
summer
as
it
would
be
quite
refreshing
poured
from
a
22oz
bomber
with
wonderful
golden
color
and
nice
head
at
the
top
light
citrus
aromas
with
a
touch
of
flowers
with
a
little
bit
of
malt
coming
through
at
the
end
the
taste
comes
in
with
the
roasted
malt
at
the
start
and
then
some
lite
hops
comes
in
at
the
end
the
feel
is
medium
bodied
with
a
nice
crisp
clean
finish
this
is
a
really
drinkable
beer
particularly
in
sessions
with
great
malt
flavor
but
with
enough
hops
to
balance
it
out
this
is
a
great
starter
beer
for
thos
who
drink
prodominantly
macro
brews
mouthfeel
is
medium
bodied
and
chewy
with
a
rush
of
carbonation
that
comes
with
each
sip
easy
to
drink
and
really
quite
refreshing
a
tasty
representation
of
the
style
and
an
easy
candidate
for
a
session
brew
id
sample
this
more
often
if
it
was
readily
available
thanks
to
unionmade
for
this
one
this
pours
a
reddish
gold
color
with
a
huge
head
there
is
alot
of
carbonation
in
this
beer
the
smell
is
very
floral
and
full
of
yeast
this
is
a
very
good
taste
with
a
full
flavor
of
malt
some
spices
and
hops
the
mf
is
very
well
balanced
between
hops
and
malt
this
is
a
very
crispclean
beer
thats
very
refreshing
and
would
go
down
great
on
a
hot
summer
day
overall
just
a
wonderful
beer
full
of
flavor
and
way
more
complex
than
i
would
have
imagined
i
only
wish
that
troutbrook
comes
out
with
different
styles
of
lagers
a
highly
enjoyable
example
of
what
an
everyday
lager
should
be
clean
tasting
and
easy
to
drink
this
is
the
beer
that
could
convert
the
masses
from
macro
produced
beers
enjoy
this
beer
is
very
drinkable
and
very
refreshing
thomas

continues
to
prove
they
are

of
lots
of
respect
from
the

i
had
this
on

at

deep
gold

this

is
the
closest
thing
to
a

octoberfest
that
ive
seen
nice
every

beer
great
drinkability
let
the
american
craft
lager
revolution
begin
overall
a
very
good
lager
i
like
it
prosit
i
might
have
given
more
5s
where
i
put
4
5s
but
its
sort
of
against
my
principles
but
it
merits
at
least
one
hooker
does
damn
fine
work
big
ups
to
ct
lots
o
lil
bubbles
that
make
this
beer
almost
fizzy
at
firstbut
it
mellows
out
to
a
very
smooth
and
just
slightly
crisp
but
with
hints
of
an
eversoslight
creamy
finish
poured
a
light
browngold
and
with
no
head
but
that
was
a
result
of
the
over
carefule
pour
nose
is
crisp
and
clean
with
some
strong
grain
tonesand
herbs
flavor
is
toast
and
bread
and
just
a
tad
chewy
for
some
reason
this
beer
makes
me
think
of
the
mahogany
and
saw
dust
from
the
old
work
shop
hops
are
very
toned
down
almost
oldish
and
provides
some
nice
herbal
and
lemon
hints
drinkability
and
notes

this
is
flavorful
and
easy
to
drink
particularly
on
a
hot
summer
afternoon
this
is
one
of
the
better
munich
style
lagers
that
i
have
had
and
yet
another
reason
to
drink
local
most
imported
light
lagers
in
my
experience
have
an
oxidizedskunked
component
that
this
does
not
have
because
it
did
not
have
to
be
shipped
across
the
ocean
d
we
need
more
lagers
like
this
in
the
ne
packed
with
flavor
and
so
easy
to
drink
thanks
to
danadeny
for
the
acquistions
this
is
by
far
the
best
lager
i
have
ever
had
if
you
think
lagers
lack
diversity
and
character
try
this
one
it
will
tear
down
ever
preconceived
notion
of
what
a
lager
is
and
can
be
overall
very
very
drinkable
easy
to
consume
and
enjoy
another
nice
brew
from
troutbrook
thanks
paul
for
enhancing
my
cinco
de
biereo
medium
bodied
very
smooth
and
easily
drinkable
really
drinkable
drinkable
enough
that
i
wish
i
bought
more
this
munich
helles
lager
poured
a
slightly
hazy
golden
to
pale
amber
color
with
tall
creamy
offwhite
foam
that
persisted
and
clung
to
the
glass
in
clumps
the
smell
was
hops
and
malt
with
a
touch
of
biscuit
and
a
light
floral
hop
aroma
the
taste
was
bready
malt
with
a
light
sweetness
there
was
a
touch
of
vinous
munich
malt
present
it
had
a
mild
hoppiness
throughout
with
a
bit
of
floral
hops
layered
on
the
mouthfeel
was
smooth
and
creamy
with
medium
body
and
modest
carbonation
the
breadymalty
flavor
lingered
a
while
in
the
aftertaste
this
was
a
nice
smooth
easy
drinking
lager
and
it
invoked
memories
of
germany
thanks
to
erikthered
for
this
bottle
thanks
to
kmpitz2
for
sharing
this
one
pours
an
orange
color
with
a
small
head
that
dies
off
quickly
and
doesnt
leave
much
lacing
on
the
glass
the
aroma
has
a
clean
caramel
malt
with
some
grassy
hops
the
flavor
is
much
the
same
caramel
malts
with
some
grassy
hops
well
balanced
and
smooth
very
clean
finish
good
lager
here
thanks
to
kev
kmpitz2
for
sharing
this
one
22oz
bomber
poured
into
a
snifter
it
pours
a
slightly
hazy
medium
orange
color
with
one
finger
of
head
there
is
a
decent
amount
of
lacing
the
smell
is
light
and
malty
with
some
classic
light
lager
grassiness
the
taste
is
slightly
sweet
and
has
some
honey
characteristics
to
it
a
bit
of
hop
bitterness
on
the
finish
the
body
is
smooth
and
thick
the
drinkability
is
great
this
is
a
nice
pleasant
lager
thans
to
ppoirtas
for
this
one
it
pours
a
peachy
orange
color
with
a
finger
of
head
that
falls
to
slightly
coat
the
beer
the
nose
is
caramel
sweet
and
grassy
the
flavor
is
not
bad
the
grasseygrainey
tones
are
prevalent
but
balanced
with
a
caramel
sweetness
the
everpresent
lager
funk
comes
through
as
well
the
feel
is
moderate
with
enough
carbonation
to
carry
it
through
not
bad
at
all
for
a
lager
i
find
it
refreshing
largely
clear
with
a
beautiful
golden
hue
that
lays
a
foundation
that
allows
tawnycoppery
influences
to
shine
there
is
plenty
of
animation
noticed
in
the
liquid
the
head
was
white
in
color
at
the
apex
the
foam
was
slightly
over
two
fingers
in
height
head
retention
was
fair
it
faded
quickly
to
a
thin
soapy
cap
this
small
cap
did
last
for
a
while
there
was
no
subsequent
lacing
the
appearance
is
average
on
the
whole
sure
the
color
is
lovely
but
i
want
more
to
look
at
if
the
head
retention
was
better
and
there
was
some
lace
the
appearance
would
be
much
improved
oh
well
it
gets
better
from
here
the
nose
is
soft
but
ample
in
maltiness
there
are
kisses
of
toffee
i
can
easily
notice
whispers
of
herbal
flowers
caramel
biscuits
toasty
there
are
very
weak
nondescript
fruity
notes
the
potency
is
moderate
in
potency
but
i
really
like
what
it
says
ghost
suggestion
of
spiciness
clean
this
must
be
from
munich
ct
the
nose
is
deadon
for
the
style
it
is
perfectly
articulate
i
do
wish
the
bouquet
had
more
liveliness
though
it
is
extremely
inviting
the
palate
is
fantastic
addicting
liquid
cocaine
this
beer
needs
to
come
in
liters
bottle
because
22ounces
is
not
enough
i
am
drinking
this
faster
than
i
can
take
write
things
down
i
really
dont
even
want
to
review
this
beer
anymore
it
is
so
dam
tasty
i
mean
screw
it
really
shit
ill
keep
righting
the
malt
profile
is
perfect
in
this
beer
it
is
sweet
but
wide
and
it
encompasses
soft
caramel
flavors
and
some
toffee
there
are
hints
of
toasty
biscuit
with
a
whisper
of
honey
sugar
cookie
toasted
bread
clean
at
the
finish
yet
the
aftertaste
has
some
spicy
hoppy
notes
damn
this
is
good
it
is
simple
but
it
is
also
everything
i
want
with
the
style
lovely
the
mouthfeel
is
relaxing
a
touch
fuller
then
medium
in
body
the
carbonation
is
on
the
low
side
but
it
is
very
fitting
drinkability
is
perfect
i
wish
i
had
many
more
bottles
wow
this
beer
is
great
id
love
to
session
with
this
beer
the
complexity
is
low
but
the
end
result
cant
be
ignored
thanks
unionmade
this
beer
was
awesome
bomber
bottle
pours
light
amber
orange
mostly
clear
some
chill
haze
white
head
nice
lacing
going
on
nose
is
spicey
and
malt
not
real
familiar
with
the
style
quite
dry
on
the
tongue
medium
bodied
notes
of
orange
peel
pepper
and
some
bready
malt
crisp
dry
and
refreshing
this
brew
is
crying
out
for
a
nice
salad
and
some
cheese
to
mingle
with
another
tasty
concoction
from
hooker
i
guess
i
do
not
understand
who
would
want
a
beer
with
heavy
feel
and
light
flavor
i
would
rather
have
the
opposite
i
am
a
malt
man
but
this
needs
more
hops
and
less
body
to
pull
it
off
this
was
a
fine
beer
but
22
oz
is
enough
for
me
pours
a
pretty
copperamber
with
a
small
and
active
off
white
head
little
ring
of
lace
is
all
thats
left
smells
mildly
citrusy
and
honey
sweet
tastes
a
lot
more
malty
than
i
wouldve
thought
solid
bit
of
caramel
with
a
distinguished
backbone
of
lemon
and
grass
moderately
thin
like
a
lager
should
be
easily
drinkable
and
downright
tasty
havent
had
a
bad
hooker
yet
and
this
continues
that
trend
crisp
lively
and
superbly
balanced
an
unexpectedly
delicious
session
brew
since
this
isnt
one
of
my
favorite
styles
im
a
huge
hophead
and
tend
to
prefer
bigger
beers
like
barleywines
so
why
am
i
drooling
over
a
light
summer
lager
i
guess
the
moral
here
is
that
even
an
unexciting
style
if
brewed
properly
can
be
outstanding
overall
this
was
a
good
representation
of
the
style
very
enjoyable
the
smell
was
mediocre
consisting
mostly
of
grains
and
light
hops
it
seems
a
little
off
the
taste
is
a
bit
better
being
crisp
and
bright
with
a
touch
of
honey
the
mouthfeel
is
good
and
clean
while
the
drinkability
is
very
good
thanks
paul
reflection
this
is
my
first
beer
from
the
troutbrook
brewing
company
and
i
thought
it
was
excellent
i
will
be
this
one
onto
my
friends
and
family
a
very
nice
crisp
beer
perhaps
a
little
more
in
line
with
a
north
american
blonde
ale
than
others
in
the
style
nice
interplay
of
malt
barely
to
the
sweet
side
with
a
touch
of
clover
honey
just
the
slightest
hint
of
some
orchard
fruit
somewhat
tart
up
front
this
is
a
very
good
helles
lager
pours
golden
honey
color
with
4
finger
head
in
my
lowenbrau
0
5l
stange
the
aromas
are
like
crisp
dry
fall
day
in
the
woods
the
taste
is
clean
bright
malt
with
a
slight
nutty
grain
undertoe
dry
finishing
beer
that
strikes
a
super
balance
between
the
sweet
malt
flavors
and
the
noble
hops
this
is
a
beer
that
goes
down
well
one
after
the
other
this
is
really
a
soft
subtle
session
bier
masterpiece
its
certainly
no
monster
and
wont
flood
your
palate
with
flavor
but
for
a
normal
strength
beer
im
having
a
hard
time
thinking
of
stuff
id
rather
drink
it
blows
my
mind
that
this
is
brewed
in
my
home
state
this
is
the
kind
of
stuff
better
suited
for
sale
in
the
tapered
500ml
bottle
with
lots
of
german
text
very
very
authentic
probably
what
its
like
to
go
to
munich
and
drink
helles
bier
from
the
source
i
count
myself
lucky
to
have
paul
davis
and
the
folks
at
thomas
hooker
making
beer
only
20
minutes
away
one
hell
of
a
summer
beer
and
a
different
style
for
a
change
if
youre
in
connecticut
for
the
summer
do
yourself
a
favor
and
buy
a
few
bottles
for
you
and
your
friends
very
highly
recommended
tastemouthfeeldrinkability
all
at
once
crisp
sour
apples
and
a
touch
of
spice
wrapped
in
sweet
malt
followed
by
a
very
mild
bitterness
and
then
a
sweet
malty
finish
very
carbonated
light
to
medium
bodied
but
amazingly
smooth
and
creamy
taste
was
extremely
fresh
clean
and
invigorating
easily
the
best
lager
ive
had
to
date
this
is
easily
something
worth
stocking
up
on
for
frequent
enjoyment
must
be
nice
to
live
in
ct
great
great
stuff
thanks
again
to
unionmade
for
the
opportunity
overall
the
beer
was
pretty
good
not
as
good
as
the
beers
of
theirs
i
tried
at
the
connecticut
river
brewfest
but
good
in
its
own
right
thanks
to
erikthered
for
this
lager
this
bomber
came
to
me
courtesy
of
beeradvocate
spritdeus
via
a
trade
after
poring
the
beer
revealed
a
clear
golden
colored
body
and
a
two
inch
tall
foamy
off
white
head
the
aroma
was
clean
with
honey
like
pilsner
malt
and
faint
florally
grassy
hops
the
taste
was
malt
driven
with
a
sweet
honeysuckle
flavor
and
very
mild
hop
bitterness
the
mouthfeel
was
creamy
and
soothing
with
a
medium
thick
body
this
style
is
supposed
to
be
difficult
to
pull
off
as
there
is
no
way
to
hide
any
off
flavors
and
troutbook
is
clearly
at
the
top
of
their
game
as
they
have
brewed
a
beer
that
does
not
possess
any
off
flavors
that
would
need
hiding
poured
into
an
imperial
pint
glass
formed
a
big
ol
2
slightly
offwhite
head
above
the
amber
brew
laces
excellently
and
aroma
is
mainly
of
pale
malts
with
an
effervescent
undertone
taste
is
maltier
than
any
other
golden
lager
ive
had
which
is
nice
and
wellbalanced
mouthfeel
and
drinkability
are
excellent
as
well
still
wishing
they
could
get
these
over
the
northern
border
would
make
my
daily
brew
choices
that
much
harder
first
sip
beer
is
average
bodied
and
has
average
carbonation
levels
the
bubbles
are
very
fine
and
prickly
on
my
tongue
flavor
is
toffee
sweet
up
front
with
a
bit
of
grainy
corn
presence
in
themiddle
and
actually
has
a
bit
of
a
soapy
astringent
finish
the
glass
was
thoroughly
rinsed
so
i
dont
think
it
was
residue
in
the
glass
the
beer
is
very
smooth
and
easy
to
drink
quite
refreshing
on
a
warm
sept
evening
another
great
beer
from
thomas
hooker
wyll
thanks
to
wyllder
for
the
bomber
first
lager
is
not
my
first
choice
in
brews
but
with
som
elike
this
i
could
move
it
up
the
scale
this
offering
poured
avery
light
golden
amber
with
a
nice
head
that
laced
nicely
down
the
glass
smell
was
malt
and
grassy
hops
a
very
nice
blend
taste
was
equally
balanced
between
a
lighytly
sweet
malt
aroma
and
grassy
hops
flavors
mouthfeel
is
medium
and
not
overly
crisp
but
thats
fine
with
me
easy
on
the
drinkability
scale
actually
a
sipper
due
to
the
heavier
body
very
nice
drinkability
damn
feels
like
this
22oz
bomber
went
like
a
12oz
bottle
picked
up
three
bottles
saturday
and
killed
them
all
this
is
just
so
damn
tasty
if
you
see
this
hooker
do
pick
it
up
draught
this
one
pours
a
clear
somewhat
darker
golden
color
there
was
a
bit
of
a
white
head
to
it
which
lingered
a
little
while
the
aroma
is
very
malty
but
not
overly
sweet
some
hint
of
hops
and
floral
notes
in
the
background
the
taste
is
very
crisp
and
clean
somewhat
less
than
medium
bodied
a
good
malt
flavor
with
some
sweetness
and
a
hint
of
hops
makes
you
wonder
why
the
big
3
cant
make
a
lager
this
tasty
thanks
to
fellow
ba
venom
david
and
i
were
able
to
try
this
very
tasty
american
version
of
a
favorite
style
i
wanted
to
make
it
special
so
out
comes
my
kloster
andechs
pils
glass
this
beer
opened
gently
and
poured
into
my
glass
and
davids
raderberger
pils
glass
if
you
gotta
know
with
no
big
fuss
or
overun
the
color
is
clear
copper
very
nice
hue
if
you
take
a
nice
glance
at
your
glass
you
have
tiny
streams
of
carbonation
rising
throughout
the
glass
head
topped
both
glasses
at
first
but
has
since
died
down
while
i
was
impressed
with
the
color
i
have
to
say
that
what
impressed
me
most
with
this
beer
was
its
spot
on
aroma
mostly
malt
exactly
what
it
should
smell
like
i
was
a
bit
surprised
that
it
was
so
authentic
after
imbibing
this
for
a
while
i
have
to
admit
my
initial
taste
impression
was
of
bready
doughiness
good
tasting
but
pronounced
now
that
the
beer
has
been
warming
for
a
while
i
have
to
say
that
the
mouthfeel
is
very
good
medium
i
think
it
could
be
a
touch
more
crisp
for
the
style
but
on
the
otherhand
it
makes
it
slightly
more
of
a
session
beer
i
am
still
getting
nice
breadiness
with
a
bit
of
hop
bite
and
some
sweet
corn
in
the
end
but
i
have
to
hand
it
to
the
brewer
no
metallic
notes
at
all
very
nice
easy
to
drink
if
i
had
this
on
tap
i
dont
think
i
would
switch
to
anything
else
at
the
session
thanks
again
venom
served
from
a
22oz
bottle
fresh
from
the
brewery
pours
into
my
glass
a
scintillating
burnished
gold
color
crystal
clear
with
nice
effervescence
and
a
perfectly
foamy
white
head
aroma
is
very
sweet
and
malty
with
some
light
german
hop
notes
and
just
a
hint
of
green
apple
sipping
yields
a
refreshing
floral
hop
character
up
front
that
is
delicately
balanced
to
complement
the
massive
chewy
malt
center
i
dont
know
if
its
partly
the
freshness
of
the
beer
but
whats
stuck
with
me
since
my
first
samples
of
this
beer
is
that
its
a
bit
like
chewing
on
a
handful
of
fresh
cracked
malt
a
bit
sweet
very
slightly
caramelized
with
a
nice
glimmer
of
spicy
hop
bitterness
in
the
finish
a
bit
of
apple
noticeable
in
the
initial
flavor
after
a
bit
as
well
body
is
not
quite
medium
which
combined
with
the
taste
make
it
immensely
drinkable
excellent
beer
cheers
to
paul
and
troutrook
for
continuing
to
crank
out
some
top
quality
beer
true
to
its
name
this
beer
has
a
light
golden
hue
and
is
topped
with
a
frothy
white
head
that
settles
down
quickly
light
aroma
of
sweet
malt
and
corn
flavor
is
also
mostly
sweet
malt
and
corn
plus
a
bit
of
citrus
and
butterscotch
very
low
hop
presence
perhaps
just
a
bit
in
the
finish
and
aftertaste
smooth
mouthfeel
with
a
fresh
and
crisp
flavor
serving
type
bottle
a
whole
lot
better
than
i
expected
d
decent
i
guess
it
could
be
considered
a
session
beer
not
a
hop
bomb
so
if
thats
your
thing
you
will
be
disappointed
overall
it
carries
the
ball
well
for
team
helles
as
far
as
look
and
feel
goes
it
is
a
departure
from
the
style
in
the
smell
and
taste
it
is
almost
in
the
ipl
territory
floral
notes
on
top
of
a
helles
body
worth
a
try
slight
hop
flavor
makes
it
just
a
couple
touches
better
than
your
average
beer
if
you
find
it
discounted
somewhere
its
worth
drinking
but
i
wouldnt
go
out
of
my
way
looking
for
it
overall
taste
has
a
bit
of
hops
and
malt
with
some
bitterness
to
it
middle
of
the
road
beer
smooth
finish
good
german
beer
brew
this
beer
i
could
take
it
or
leave
it
not
blowing
my
mind
its
a
lawnmower
beer
at
best
imo
its
a
ok
beer
really
nice
caramel
color
poured
into
a
glass
like
pretty
much
everything
else
leinies
puts
out
this
is
a
mediocre
product
taste
is
bitter
stale
hops
and
grass
there
are
much
better
options
out
there
this
shows
what
the
brand
can
do
when
they
want
i
enjoy
several
styles
but
still
miss
the
fireside
nut
brown
that
turned
me
on
to
craft
beer
even
before
i
knew
it
leinenkugels
only
misstep
in
my
book
has
been
hoppin
helles
now
named
helles
yeah
for
its
musky
bitterness
and
the
fact
that
its
inconsistent
in
leinenkugels
line
of
exceptional
fruitier
brews
solid
hoppy
easy
to
drink
beer
tastes
like
hops
and
bread
golden
colored
dont
expect
a
nice
head
or
any
lacing
but
its
tasty
thank
you
leinenkugels
for
finally
brewing
something
without
fruit
clean
crisp
and
wonderful
looking
beer
not
really
my
style
but
enjoyable
nonetheless
beer
500
helles
yeah
part
of
a
great
sampler
pack
found
at
the
local
supermercado
containing
actually
four
brews
of
which
i
have
tried
none
that
said
lets
give
it
a
whirl
popping
the
top
i
get
a
nice
sweet
noble
hop
waft
with
a
malt
base
pours
to
a
bright
pee
yellow
with
a
pillow
top
white
foam
head
that
recedes
slowly
and
clings
taste
is
a
nice
shot
of
honey
up
front
with
a
balanced
but
slightly
more
bitter
mix
of
sweet
malt
and
hops
that
is
natural
and
very
grassy
finish
is
a
light
sweetness
with
a
quickly
fading
bitterness
that
leaves
a
clean
palate
a
tasty
brew
great
for
hot
weather
from
the
explorer
pack
mixed
twelve
legoland
publix
this
was
tastier
than
expected
and
a
nice
surprise
borderline
excellent
and
just
what
you
expect
in
a
good
german
style
lager
poured
from
a
brown
12
oz
bottle
has
a
golden
color
with
a
12
inch
head
smell
is
mild
a
bit
of
malts
taste
is
crisp
and
light
some
hops
malts
kind
of
mild
feels
medium
bodied
in
the
mouth
and
overall
is
a
refreshing
and
sessionable
beer
i
was
pleasently
surprised
by
this
i
had
low
expectations
if
youre
looking
for
something
light
and
refreshing
this
will
fit
the
bill
slight
hop
bite
against
a
malty
base
no
off
flavors
not
bad
overall
3
54
the
strongest
suit
of
this
beer
is
its
appearance
when
poured
the
head
is
still
standing
straight
up
on
top
and
adds
to
the
creaminess
of
the
beer
straight
from
the
bottle
it
tastes
metallic
from
a
glass
its
a
nice
balance
i
would
drink
this
again
if
it
were
given
to
me
again
this
beer
just
completely
missed
the
mark
i
suppose
if
they
called
it
a
hoppy
american
pale
lager
it
would
make
some
sense
but
even
then
it
would
not
be
good
overall
a
decent
beer
slightly
out
of
style
and
harsh
on
the
finer
edges
of
this
style
not
terrible
but
i
agree
its
a
very
macro
feel
on
the
other
hand
its
a
very
light
crisp
lager
and
im
wondering
if
im
not
just
biased
to
the
style
because
it
reminds
me
of
so
many
american
light
beers
underwhelming
to
be
sure
but
its
not
a
terrible
tasting
beer
if
youre
in
the
mood
for
something
very
light
this
will
fit
the
bill
but
its
not
going
to
turn
heads
ok
beer
a
very
macro
beer
feel
not
much
hop
flavor
not
that
complex
works
well
with
pizza
since
it
doesnt
take
away
from
the
flavor
of
the
food
probably
wont
buy
again
unless
im
in
some
backwoods
wisconsin
bar
that
only
carrys
leinies
as
their
craft
beer
happens
often
overall
i
like
this
beer
actually
a
great
lawnmower
beer
and
one
that
i
could
enjoy
all
afternoon
in
a
backyard
bbq
much
better
than
the
macros
imho
is
there
better
sure
but
this
is
a
decent
dry
lager
with
a
touch
of
hops
cheap
and
sessionable
at
5
5
d
not
too
good
really
chug
en
down
anyway
hoppin
helles
is
probably
the
most
disappointing
leinenkugel
effort
ive
experienced
thus
far
it
bears
that
same
sort
of
grassiness
that
i
didnt
like
about
guinnesss
harp
lager
and
that
same
kind
of
bitterness
i
find
prevalent
in
many
domestic
beers
not
to
mention
i
always
categorized
leinenkugel
for
its
flavors
be
them
lemon
orange
lemon
berry
or
simply
just
refreshing
and
rather
intoxicating
hops
but
hoppin
helles
overdoes
it
to
the
point
where
the
flavor
is
more
of
a
nuisance
than
a
presence
definitely
the
weakest
of
leinenkugels
otherwise
surprisingly
good
line
of
beers
its
moderately
crisp
in
a
lightmedium
body
appropriate
and
not
thin
its
pretty
smooth
without
losing
the
bite
presentation
packaged
in
a
standard
twelveounce
brown
glass
longneck
bottle
with
a
twistoff
crown
served
in
a
samuel
adams
boston
lager
sensory
glass
overall
more
than
i
was
expecting
from
leines
while
not
the
best
of
style
appears
to
be
a
reasonable
attempt
overall
objectively
the
best
of
three
leinies
i
tried
but
looses
points
for
not
being
to
style
this
wouldnt
be
half
bad
with
a
pinch
more
improvement
close
but
no
cigar
this
beer
was
a
golden
orange
color
with
a
pretty
lousy
thin
head
the
head
became
nonexistent
after
a
few
minutes
which
made
the
appearance
poor
you
could
definitely
smell
the
hops
in
the
beginning
my
first
sip
was
nice
and
hoppy
what
i
expected
but
the
more
i
drank
the
less
impact
the
taste
had
on
me
it
has
that
nice
citrus
like
bitterness
that
you
expect
from
an
ipa
but
it
was
over
powering
this
would
a
great
ipa
style
to
have
with
meals
because
it
wouldnt
over
power
the
taste
of
your
food
overall
nice
beer
i
enjoyed
drinking
it
but
honestly
i
dont
see
myself
making
a
run
to
buy
it
specifically
anytime
soon
if
i
was
a
friends
and
this
was
an
option
i
would
highly
consider
it
though
one
of
the
better
leinenkugel
offerings
for
sure
but
it
still
needs
some
cleaning
up
to
be
a
good
beer
overall
im
very
pleased
o
i
get
the
concept
make
a
hoppy
helles
that
might
appeal
more
to
the
lupulinaddled
american
market
it
works
for
jacks
abby
right
its
not
a
terrible
beer
just
a
little
overblown
in
all
respects
the
hop
acidity
takes
a
slightly
unpleasant
turn
particularly
on
the
nose
and
drinkability
suffers
a
bit
because
of
its
size
a
more
subtle
approach
may
actually
have
been
better
here
i
actually
have
to
respect
leinenkugels
miller
for
trying
something
like
this
and
not
just
laying
down
and
becoming
that
shandy
brewery
however
whats
really
crazy
is
that
i
bought
this
from
a
25
case
close
out
stack
3
weeks
after
the
bottled
on
date
so
i
guess
nobody
really
committed
to
it
respect
rescinded
just
because
i
arrived
late
to
an
impromptu
game
night
doesnt
mean
i
cant
enjoy
a
new
beer
or
two
right
this
one
pours
a
clear
sunrise
brass
topped
by
a
finger
of
white
foam
the
nose
comprises
light
white
bread
very
light
hard
water
mild
grass
and
a
touch
of
pine
needle
the
taste
brings
in
more
of
the
same
the
nowflowery
hops
barely
standing
out
against
a
bland
slightlybready
backdrop
the
body
is
a
hefty
light
with
a
light
moderate
carbonation
and
a
fluid
feel
overall
an
okay
hoppy
helles
at
best
something
that
just
kinda
sits
on
my
tongue
without
doing
anything
but
wetting
it
its
not
bad
just
not
good
or
anything
really
i
nothing
this
beer
i
poured
this
into
a
glass
it
has
a
gold
color
with
a
small
fizzy
head
the
aroma
has
a
slight
hop
aroma
to
it
the
taste
is
of
slight
hint
of
pine
from
the
hops
and
a
deep
lager
flavor
to
it
the
mouthfeel
is
ok
and
leaves
after
taste
on
the
tomgie
overall
a
ok
beer
i
think
everyone
is
being
too
generous
here
a
74
not
even
close
this
tastes
like
a
macrolager
not
an
ipa
where
are
the
hops
i
taste
none
if
it
is
90
degrees
out
this
beer
would
work
any
other
time
though
not
at
all
quite
possible
the
worst
ipa
i
have
ever
had
another
doozy
from
jacob
leinenkugel
serving
type
bottle
a
decent
helles
especially
if
youre
not
a
huge
fan
of
dark
heavy
beer
decent
beer
on
its
own
with
a
few
rough
patches
with
its
level
of
hops
it
could
be
confused
as
a
pilsner
nonetheless
hofbrau
and
the
rest
of
munich
have
little
to
fear
here
o
very
refreshing
and
invigorating
leinenkugels
has
definitely
put
forth
a
very
refreshing
and
drinkable
spring
beer
i
can
literally
taste
spring
its
nothing
that
i
would
write
home
about
but
it
is
definitely
a
beer
ill
drink
again
whenever
i
have
a
chance
to
im
a
fan
of
leinenkugel
but
not
very
fond
of
this
beer
its
not
terrible
and
its
very
easy
to
drink
but
with
so
many
good
hoppy
beers
out
there
this
just
wont
do
it
really
reminds
me
of
a
soured
miller
lite
on
a
hot
summer
day
after
mowing
the
grass
i
could
slam
a
few
of
these
but
thats
about
all
i
wont
be
buying
again
smc
o
i
like
the
style
and
very
much
like
this
take
on
it
winner
leinenkugels

overall
a
decent
helles
lager
not
all
that
authentic
however
overall
i
would
recommend
it
to
those
who
prefer
hoppy
beers
i
do
not
mind
hoppy
beers
but
i
did
not
find
this
taste
particularly
enjoyable
for
me
notes
pleasant
beer
probably
one
of
leinenkugels
best
clearly
made
to
market
to
the
hop
niche
hoppin
helles
surprisingly
hoppy
in
both
the
aroma
and
flavor
though
bright
with
resinous
citrusy
and
grassy
hops
in
the
nose
crystal
clear
deep
gold
body
beneath
a
twofingered
head
of
rocky
white
froth
that
holds
really
well
eventually
over
time
about
a
half
a
glass
in
it
completely
settles
but
maintains
an
almost
full
surface
coating
good
to
verygood
lacing
mediumlight
body
with
a
gently
crisp
carbonation
the
flavor
is
balanced
displaying
the
hops
foremost
but
backing
it
with
a
solid
amount
of
malt
balancing
very
firm
bitterness
it
finishes
dry
with
some
added
herbal
character
helles
is
certainly
not
the
style
designation
for
this
beer
resinous
and
citrusy
hops
and
helles
just
dont
go
together
its
more
of
a
pils
or
even
a
pale
ale
regardless
of
whether
its
lagered
or
not
regardless
its
welldone
and
drinkable
if
the
malt
were
of
a
better
quality
this
could
be
a
great
beer
but
as
it
stands
it
seems
to
be
simply
lackluster
american
6row
shame
overall
not
a
bad
beer
love
that
leinenkugels
is
bringing
some
new
beers
to
the
party
i
probably
wouldnt
seek
this
one
out
but
i
also
wouldnt
turn
one
down
my
suggestion
is
give
it
a
try
you
might
be
pleasantly
surprised
o
it
was
alright
not
much
of
a
helles
not
that
hoppin
either
easy
enough
to
drink
though
just
bland
o
matched
really
well
with
some
spicy
sausages
easy
to
drink
crisp
and
refreshing
alcohol
is
very
well
hidden
you
know
what
this
is
surprisingly
good
i
know
its
easy
to
hate
on
leinies
but
having
this
one
and
their
kölsch
it
seems
that
when
they
want
to
they
can
make
quite
a
solid
brew
if
i
were
picking
up
a
6
or
12
pack
and
the
craft
pickings
were
slim
i
could
get
this
and
easily
feel
happy
about
that
the
mouth
is
decent
and
it
is
an
easy
beer
to
pair
with
stuff
like
wings
and
chili
for
what
it
is
worth
i
brought
a
case
of
this
a
football
party
on
new
years
day
and
it
was
all
drank
some
of
the
folks
there
were
beer
people
so
i
would
say
the
hit
the
drinkability
approachability
goals
overall
a
nice
sessionable
and
clean
helles
lager
nothing
over
the
top
but
still
a
beer
i
could
put
away
several
of
3
145
00
overall
it
was
ok
something
i
picked
up
in
the
leines
sampler
and
would
probably
not
purchase
this
in
a
sixer
pours
out
to
a
nice
golden
color
brilliantly
clear
and
a
decent
head
with
moderate
lacing
aroma
is
definitely
hoppier
than
a
true
helles
with
cat
pee
pine
mint
dill
and
citrus
and
other
american
aromas
flavor
is
a
nice
crisp
lager
that
is
overpowered
by
the
trendy
hop
mania
mouthfeel
is
good
overall
this
is
offending
me
as
i
would
like
a
good
helles
not
a
jacked
up
trendy
brew
bought
a
case
of
this
on
off
the
sale
rack
for
15
bucks
had
been
wanting
to
try
it
but
never
got
around
to
it
until
i
saw
an
offer
i
could
not
refuse
so
i
rolled
the
dice
overall
i
give
leiny
credit
on
this
one
it
is
a
helles
lager
biscuityalty
malty
sweet
goodness
with
a
overdose
of
hops
for
the
style
for
the
style
do
not
expect
an
dipa
ipa
apa
or
any
kind
of
a
but
it
is
a
good
departure
for
those
who
like
malty
beers
but
let
curiosity
get
the
best
of
them
and
buy
a
beer
with
hop
in
the
name
maybe
this
will
be
my
gateway
to
hoppier
beers
o
i
dont
know
what
to
say
i
know
this
was
not
intended
to
be
a
true
to
style
helles
lager
it
wasnt
ipa
hoppy
but
definitely
hoppier
than
your
standard
german
brewed
helles
lager
with
that
said
i
did
enjoy
this
one
as
it
had
some
nice
american
hop
characteristics
style
guidelines
are
definitely
disappearing
in
the
us
not
sure
what
to
think
of
that
read
ba
magazine
issues
81
82
the
bros
touch
on
this
topic
i
do
not
know
how
to
precisely
quantify
this
but
upon
removing
the
cap
it
smelled
like
beer
my
excitedly
aggro
pour
created
two
fingers
of
puffy
bone
white
head
that
resembled
to
top
of
a
vanilla
ice
cream
cone
the
nose
was
both
grassy
from
the
hops
and
biscuity
from
the
malt
and
it
put
me
in
mind
of
some
of
my
earliest
beer
drinking
color
was
a
gorgeous
goldenyellow
srm
4
with
nequality
clarity
the
unholy
trio
of
mammon
king
midas
and
croesus
were
suddenly
in
front
of
me
clamoring
for
a
sip
but
that
privilege
was
mine
all
mine
mouthfeel
was
soft
and
it
makes
me
wonder
about
their
water
in
wisco
their
beers
all
have
that
same
softness
which
i
really
like
it
makes
for
great
drinkability
and
i
wish
that
they
would
put
more
of
the
leinie
line
in
cans
the
taste
was
grassy
minty
definitely
hoppy
but
not
confrontationally
hopped
this
was
more
like
maintenance
drinking
for
this
selfavowed
hophead
finish
was
semidry
and
very
satisfying
what
a
great
recent
find
in
one
of
my
local
bottle
shops
malts
and
hops
can
generously
be
described
as
light
it
is
clean
at
least
just
not
a
whole
lot
there
the
hop
blend
seems
like
it
would
be
pretty
decent
if
you
used
more
a
lot
more
meh
certainly
wouldnt
go
looking
for
but
i
wont
have
much
problem
finishing
the
3
bottles
in
the
pack
to
the
nose
i
only
picked
up
some
malt
but
it
certainly
isnt
unpleasant
but
rather
unfulfilling
the
mouthfeel
is
oaky
but
as
i
said
if
youre
looking
for
a
hoppy
pa
or
ipa
it
will
be
disappointing
the
only
thing
that
saves
this
beer
from
an
f
is
infact
that
it
is
claimed
to
be
a
lager
if
you
judge
this
beer
as
and
american
adjunct
lager

my
neck
of

and
jumped
at

at

bad
at
all
just
doesnt
live
up
to
what
i
expect
from
something
called
helles
those
who
feverishly
tick
as
part
of
the
oneanddone
club
may
easily
fail
to
appreciate
the
greatness
of
this
brew
my
opinion
of
this
beer
as
with
so
many
has
evolved
with
each
serving
to
my
mind
this
one
gets
it
right
as
a
wonderful
compromise
between
flavor
and
body
the
grassy
and
herbal
hop
presence
is
undeniable
yet
not
to
the
point
of
histrionics
while
the
malts
provide
firm
nutritional
and
textural
support
and
even
approach
oktoberfest
levels
yet
without
the
likelihood
of
maillard
fatigue
maybe
a
little
more
aromatics
would
be
nice
at
least
as
a
first
impression
booster
but
in
the
end
they
would
be
irrelevant
and
possibly
even
an
unwelcome
distraction
i
will
be
rushing
out
soon
to
find
another
fresh
6
or
12pack
classic
lager
crisp
flavorful
and
pleasantly
refreshing
a
very
basic
lager
this
is
truly
the
best
of
the
munich
oktoberfest
six
very
similar
to
hofbrau
and
a
little
lighter
in
taste
than
a
paulaner
years
of
perfection
have
made
this
brew
one
of
the
best
poured
a
clear
mediumlight
gold
a
fizzy
head
forms
and
most
of
it
dissipates
quickly
leaving
only
a
little
bit
of
lacing
the
aroma
is
like
sourdough
bread
with
a
little
bit
of
noble
hops
the
flavor
is
more
robust
malty
bready
with
some
nice
bitterness
on
the
finish
it
has
a
thinner
body
but
a
nice
crisp
finish
probably
a
reason
theyve
brewed
this
for
a
while
good
malt
character
which
is
most
important
for
the
style
nicely
balanced
o
probably
damn
good
fresh
will
have
to
try
it
again
at
some
point
oa
simple
beer
but
very
well
made
one
of
the
better
exports
ive
had
a
beautiful
sweetmalty
helles
with
a
full
body
and
the
taste
never
fades
rated
to
style
o
this
beer
has
nice
malty
flavors
that
taste
true
to
the
style
but
seems
like
it
could
use
a
little
more
hops
to
balance
things
out
nothing
too
exciting
and
no
distinct
flavors
stand
out
but
very
decent
overall
overall
drinkability
very
drinkable
albeit
mild
like
all
helles
finely
tuned
to
be
drank
in
mass
quantity
with
food
but
otherwise
nothing
special
went
well
with
pizza
and
salad
tonight
but
i
think
i
would
tire
of
it
by
itself
it
i
had
it
without
food
admittedly
i
wonder
if
this
beer
would
be
more
notable
in
flavor
if
it
was
before
the
best
by
date
but
its
not
that
far
gone
so
hard
to
say
my
mark
out
of
one
hundred
would
be
87
fixed
brats
and
sauerkraut
with
very
high
hopes
had
one
taste
and
switched
out
for
a
fullers
the
munich
gold
bland
all
the
way
around
the
appearance
was
not
deep
enough
very
little
smell
to
discern
and
mouthfeel
watery
perhaps
an
old
keg
or
perhaps
too
light
for
the
dinner
pairing
will
try
a
heavier
german
beer
for
pairing
with
this
meal
next
time
the
flavor
has
a
nice
gentle
taste
of
pilsner
malt
with
a
light
nutty
quality
and
low
bitterness
in
the
taste
with
generally
clean
yeast
tastte
with
mild
diacetyl
in
the
middle
with
grain
and
malt
dominant
with
some
mineral
accents
overall
this
is
a
quaffable
lager
with
a
nice
drinkable
quality
i
would
buy
this
again
pretty
decent
example
of
the
style
overall
nice
more
enjoyable
than
many
lagers
but
was
not
as
good
as
the
first
time
i
had
it
wondering
if
the
metal
can
had
any
impact
on
my
drinking
experiences
another
beer
to
be
revisited
overall
comes
across
as
thoughtful
and
carefully
crafted
even
if
its
designed
to
be
a
lessthancomplex
crowd
pleaser
perhaps
a
bit
more
light
and
sweet
than
is
typical
for
the
style
but
altogether
pleasant
i
wouldnt
mind
another
prost
lampertland
taste
is
wellbalanced
and
classic
for
the
style
grainy
with
cardboard
notes
and
delicate
bitter
finish
moderate
carbonation
and
medium
body
definitely
a
good
beer
remarks
did
not
score
a
t
s
m
at
that
time
disregard
those
scores
o
good
palate
cleasner
refreshing
and
a
good
alternative
to
augustiner
overall
it
starts
off
promising
enough
but
trails
off
quickly
in
the
finish
its
a
good
helles
but
just
not
enough
for
me
to
consider
it
great
much
less
one
of
the
top
examples
of
the
style
o
the
best
thing
i
can
compare
this
to
is
a
pilsner
with
an
emphasis
on
balance
same
charms
but
less
hoporiented
and
more
wellrounded
a
surprisingly
delicious
lager
o
a
classic
battle
between
hops
and
malt
im
glad
neither
came
out
too
dominant
this
is
really
a
beer
to
behold
its
a
simple
and
good
beer
o
this
is
a
good
helles
has
good
clean
flavors
with
good
feel
this
beer
has
the
flavor
i
taste
on
my
minds
tongue
when
i
reminisce
about
travels
through
germany
it
pours
a
light
yellow
straw
color
with
a
thick
white
foamy
head
smells
slightly
skunky
with
lemon
and
grass
followed
by
some
bready
malt
has
a
good
flavor
better
than
most
euro
lagers
with
some
funk
grass
and
lemon
feels
nice
and
refreshing
with
moderate
carbonation
and
a
dry
finish
this
beer
is
solid
and
i
could
drink
way
more
wish
i
had
some
clear
gold
large
diminishing
fizzy
white
head
smells
sweet
honey
and
plastic
like
many
canadian
shitty
lagers
taste
is
simple
and
honeysweet
but
floral
and
grassy
with
no
crappy
adjunct
flavours
pretty
nice
really
light
mildly
syrupy
body
decent
carbonation
and
a
quick
finish
very
summery
and
drinkable
overall
an
authentic
helles
lager
from
a
respected
german
brewery
agreeable
flavor
and
light
feel
perfect
for
drinking
alone
or
pairing
with
a
wide
array
of
foods
review
largely
confirmed
with
tasting
in
august
2013
overall
a
great
german
beer
with
a
smooth
body
and
nice
flavors
pretty
much
on
par
for
the
style
a
good
example
of
how
lagers
can
be
a
great
style
with
a
big
body
and
quite
bold
flavour
this
beer
is
refreshing
and
quite
drinkable
quite
well
done
worth
a
try
4
prost
i
grabbed
all
of
the
munich
lagers
i
could
find
locally
which
only
amounted
to
this
one
spatens
and
lowenbrau
enough
for
a
small
comparative
ranking
i
really
do
like
this
beer
and
am
bumping
the
score
considerably
to
reflect
that
its
not
spectacular
or
attentiongrabbing
in
any
way
just
a
solidlybrewed
reliable
allmalt
german
lager
in
a
pinch
i
might
take
spaten
over
this
its
slightly
cheaper
but
from
a
realistic
perspective
theyre
both
great
and
well
worth
returning
to
o
this
beer
is
easy
to
drink
refreshing
and
quite
sessionable
from
a
variety
pack

2
oz
bottle
labeled
munich
gold
gotta
be
the
same
thing
though
pours
very
pale
yellow
almost
like
an
american
lager
but
with
a
more
substantial
and
lingering
head
reminds
of
the
more
mainstream
european
lagers
such
as
harp
a
fresh
smell
that
i
cant
quite
place
me
the
taste
reminds
me
of
a
czech
lager
nothing
to
any
extreme
but
all
very
crispy
and
clean
although
i
can
only
seem
to
compare
this
to
other
beers
it
is
still
able
to
carve
a
niche
as
a
solid
beer
on
its
own
albeit
not
outstanding
in
most
respects
poured
into
a
pokal
a
clear
medium
golden
with
a
great
blooming
white
head
that
settled
slowly
leaving
two
rings
of
broken
lace
behindto
me
this
is
what
golden
lager
should
look
like
with
great
color
and
a
large
blooming
head
toasted
bread
and
honey
malts
in
the
nose
along
with
some
mineralflavors
have
a
vanilla
tinge
to
them
with
mild
toastiness
and
more
honey
infused
mils
sweetness
in
the
aftertaste
this
is
a
damn
well
made
helles
lageri
wish
i
could
get
that
anno
1417
keller
beer
around
here
overall
not
a
bad
beer
very
easy
to
drink
with
some
sweet
and
some
more
crisp
characteristics
a
good
session
brew
this
beer
pours
out
a
straw
golden
colour
with
a
nice
thick
two
finger
head
smells
strongly
of
malted
barley
a
bit
of
hops

fresh
baked

light
and
sweet
lots
of
breads
and
grains
throughout
with
a
clean
slightly
bitter
finish
medium
bodied
a
bit
smooth
a
very
drinkable
lager
pours
a
crystal
clear
gold
with
a
1
inch
foamy

head
that
settles
to
a
film

of
the

slight

taste
is
of
grain
and

up

a
slight
sweet

flavor
on
the
finish
this
beer
has
a
good
level
of
carbonation
with
a
crisp
mouthfeel
overall
this
is
a
pretty
good
lager
but
nothing
that
really
stands
out
to
me
o
worthy
of
respect
but
nothing
to
get
excited
about
od
a
weak
effort
for
a
bavarian
lager
i
was
expecting
a
quality
helles
and
i
got
a
run
of
the
mill
lager
not
worth
revisiting
drinkable
and
barely
passable
o
a
decent
lager
but
it
does
not
excite
it
could
use
more
hops
and
bitterness
and
a
bit
more
crispness
it
does
look
great
and
it
is
clean
and
drinkable
pale

is
balanced
by
hoppy

malty
flavor
a
typical
lager
no
defining
characteristics
except
the
thin

overall
this
is
a
highly
drinkable
pale
lager
with
good
flavours
and
no
real
flaws
all
in
all
a
good
beer
but
a
forgettable
beer
it
lacks
character
nothing
special
to
look
at
but
a
decent
pale
lager
nonetheless
poured
with
a
smallish
white
head
that
soon
settled
down
to
just
a
bit
and
no
lace
color
is
a
clear
yellow
gold
with
perfect
bubble
trails
up
the

reminds
me
of
german
pilsner
malt
grass
grain
hop
flavors
not
as
hoppy
clean
balanced
with
tang
to
balance
the
sweetness
of
the
malt
and
just
a
bit
of
hop
bitterness
to
round
things
out
body
is
good
and
so
is
carbonation
finish
is
like
flavor
and
short
to
medium
long
session
beer
extremely
clean
and
complex
malt
flavors
make
this
a
great
representation
of
a
munich
helleswhich
are
pretty
damn
hard
to
find
but
really
from
hackerpschorr
would
you
expect
anything
less
good
stuff
this
bottle
may
be
past
its
prime
i
recall
hackerpschorr
being
better
in
recent
memory
gold
in
color
with
a
nice
appearance
has
a
nice
hoppy
bite
very
drinkable
smell
is
average
but
better
than
most
euro
beers
not
a
bad
beer
has
a
nice
mouthfeel
and
an
over
all
ok
taste
we
agree
this
is
a
good
beer
to
have
once
or
twice
could
be
fridge
worth
we
still
like
the
home
team
out
of
the
bottle
this
brew
poured
a
dark
yellowgolden
color
color
with
a
virginalwhite
thin
cap

the
aroma
is
a
sweet
bread
malty
affair
the
flavor
is
par
for
the
course
the
grain
coats
the
mouth
somewhere
a
fruity
ghost
hovers
the
beer
exits
with
just
a
hint
of
sulfur
on
the
palate
could
be
a
little
cleaner
but
not
a
bad
beer
o
light
fairly
refreshing
but
not
all
that
clean
not
a
bad
drink
though
notes
well
crafted
german
lager
doesnt
really
stand
out
of
the
pack
at
5
5
abv
not
really
a
sessioner
nothing
wrong
with
this
beer
at
all
easy
to
drink
but
i
prefer
several
other
helles
from
munich
more
a
good
and
rare
lager
that
destroys
the
common
macrobrews
from
the
330
ml
bottle
stamped
0611l15601y
sampled
on
august
20
2011
the
pour
is
straw
yellow
with
golden
hues
and
a
nice
enough
lingering
head
the
aroma
is
bold
with
german
malts
with
a
more
subtle
biscuit
and
buttery
note
the
body
is
pretty
creamy
and
about
medium
the
taste
is
very
traditionally
german
with
big
malts
sugar
sweetness
mildly
grainy
and
smoothly
bitter
it
fits
in
well
on
a
hot
summer
day
o
this
is
a
nice
munich
helles
lager
not
my
favorite
style
but
i
love
trying
beers
from
germany
o
super
average
nothing
i
wouldnt
have
again
but
certainly
nothing
to
go
looking
for
either
color
is
golden
very
clear
with
a
nice
white
head
that
disappear
quickly
the
aroma
presents
some
wheat
notes
and
malts
timid
aroma
very
light
on
the
taste
it
is
floral
with
a
very
light
bitterness
this
taste
like
a
typical
german
lager
fresh
dry
easy
drinking
beer
refreshing
watery
light
body
with
some
carbonation
nice
but
nothing
more
overall
a
decent
easydrinking
munich
helles
overall
a
tasty
pils
would
have
it
again
for
sure
nice
german
beer
on
draft
at
the
axe
pours
a
very
pale
golden
color
with
a
small
white
head
light
malt
aromas
taste
jumps
out
a
bit
more
and
has
a
great
flavor
decent
german
malts
come
through
light
sweetness
to
it
a
good
clean
and
slightly
bitter
finish
very
drinkable
o
this
is
yet
another
excellent
beer
from
germany
and
easily
one
of
the
best
lagers
i
have
had
if
not
the
best
drinkability
for
the
price
and
flavour
point
one
of
my
standby
session
beers
its
not
challenging
or
exciting
but
easy
to
drink
refreshing
and
tastes
good
takes
me
back
to
germany
so
sentimental
value
is
good
too
the
lager
pours
out
as
a
golden
colored
liquid
with
a
fluffy
white
head
on
it
that
doesnt
last
very
long
the
lacing
isnt
really
there
either
the
smell
of
the
beer
gives
off
the
normal
aromas
of
a
lager
some
grass
some
wood
little
bit
of
hops
the
taste
of
this
beer
is
average
in
my
opinion
it
has
some
bitterness
to
it
and
not
a
whole
lot
else
mouthfeel
was
lighter
bodied
and
fairl
easy
to
drink
overall
i
wouldnt
seek
this
one
out
again
o
expected
little
but
was
surprised
drank
it
at
the
right
time
long
day
at
work
and
hot
perfect
time
for
a
cold
lager
reminiscent
of
the
lager
my
dad
drank
when
i
first
got
into
beer
overall
munich
gold
is
a
solid
german
lager
that
has
an
even
balance
to
it
id
rather
have
one
of
these
than
the
typical
german
pilsener
i
believe
this
has
a
better
taste
nose
to
it
a
nice
beer
that
goes
good
during
any
time
of
year
this
beer
is
refreshing
and
goes
down
easy
but
does
not
present
anything
memorable
or
notable
nice
beer
this
style
seems
to
be
one
of
german
pils
light
quality
ingredients
though
i
like
it
d
everything
was
good
up
until
the
taste
something
seems
off
here
too
much
metal
d
a
solid
helles
and
excellent
summer
beer
not
a
standout
but
very
refreshing
and
easydrinking
pure
golden
color
with
a
lacy
head
toasted
nut
bread
dough
and
clay
aromas
follow
through
on
a
round
supple
entry
to
a
dryish
medium
body
with
lemon
soufflé
note
finishes
with
a
crisp
lingering
well
integrated
fade
a
pretty
good
helles
i
would
certainly
drink
it
again
o
this
really
takes
me
back
to
germany
well
done
fairly
typical
euro
lager
but
its
dry
and
refreshing
qualities
will
get
me
to
try
it
again
drinkability
is
ok
nothing
wrong
with
this
beer
but
it
is
a
bit
boring
mouthfeel
is
light
crisp
and
clean
making
for
a
very
refreshing
lager
beers
like
this
remind
me
why
i
enjoy
the
various
lager
styles
so
much
simple
and
straightforward
but
with
a
delicious
refreshing
taste
mouthfeel
is
very
easy
going
the
pinch
from
the
hops
is
great
on
the
tongue
and
is
supported
by
a
great
sizzle
of
carbonation
munich
gold
is
a
great
easy
drinking
beer
you
can
really
taste
what
american
macro
lagers
are
trying
to
do
but
fail
at
awesome
brew
and
totally
worth
buying
when
you
see
it
i
only
wish
our
big
name
beers
were
brewed
like
the
germans
brew
theirs
would
buy
it
again
drink
i
really
wasnt
a
big
fan
of
this
beer
i
found
myself
wishing
i
had
bought
something
else
instead
pours
typical
yellow
with
a
white
head
poor
retention
and
minimal
lacing
great
thin
and
sharp
mouthfeel
with
advanced
biting
carbonation
and
a
crisp
refreshing
finish
overall
hackerpschorr
munchner
gold
is
a
good
beer
that
meets
the
requirements
of
the
style
recommended
not
a
bad
lager
the
appearance
and
smell
are
nice
but
the
taste
feels
just
a
hint
watery
the
malts
are
very
pleasant
d
very
runofthemill
helles
lager
nothing
special
but
drinkable
nonetheless
d
very
drinkable
note
i
finished
the
whole
6
pack
over
a
few
days
and
had
this
exact
impression
every
single
time
also
kind
of
shocked
to
see
that
i
have
the
lowest
review
of
this
beer
maybe
i
got
a
bad
6pack
drinkable
interesting
enough
to
be
engaging
overall
this
is
a
very
impressive
beer
not
overly
thick
and
sweet
at
the
same
time
which
makes
it
drinkable
in
most
circumstances
would
highly
recommend
this
beer
pours

i
really
like
this
from
hacker
pschorr
a
great
example
of
this
style
with
a
bready
flavor
and
low
on
hops
d
a
fine
example
of
a
helles
d
could
use
a
bit
more
kick
but
isnt
lacking
pretty
good
though
my
favorite
hackerpschorr
offering
thats
available
to
me
one
of
the
best
examples
of
grains
and
bready
malt
that
ive
encountered
so
far
a
little
bit
different
than
many
other
german
lagers
and
certainly
a
drinkable
one
d
good
stuff
much
better
than
your
average
lager
d
a
very
classic
sessionable
lager
is
definitely
a
purity
law
compliant
brew
with
a
little
more
dry
which
i
enjoy
i
got
a
finger
of
bonewhite
head
with
decent
retention
color
was
a
slightly
hazy
deep
gold
nose
had
the
characteristic
lager
sweetness
unencumbered
by
adjuncts
it
was
heavenly
in
the
face
of
all
of
the
aals
i
have
been
subjected
to
of
late
mouthfeel
was
medium
with
a
grassy
hop
bite
on
the
tongue
finish
was
semidry
with
a
little
bit
of
lingering
lager
sweetness
not
bad
but
here
in
lancaster
county
where
lagers
are
a
way
of
life
why
go
for
an
import
id
stick
with
stoudts
gold
instead
d
lighter
in
body
and
flavor
than
other
popular
german
brewers
versions
of
this
style
but
still
with
a
great
nose
would
appeal
to
typical
american
palates
more
than
something
a
little
higher
in
hops
like
when
a
huge
labatt
blue
fan
says
oh
hey
that
somethinschlager
or
that
whositsteiner
now
thats
a
damn
good
beer

i
like
it
too

terrific
around

what

you
really
asks
for

helles
certainly
not
the
best
ive
had
has
a
golden

very
malty
taste
and
is
a
bit
heavy
on
the
mouth
feel
not
much
at
all
in
terms
of
hops
and
the
malt
is
a
bit
smokier
and
upfront
than
most
helles
pretty
drinkable
but
not
that
crisp
in
the
finish
due
to
the
lack
of
hops
nice
full
bodied
mouthfeel
and
very
refreshing
one
of
the
best
lagers
ive
had
in
recent
memory
why
doesnt
mass
produced
beer
from
the
new
world
taste
like
this
d
easy

the

knocks
down
the
quaffability

taste
is
also

by
grainy
cereal
with

about
average
with
good

not
bad
overall
too
a
bit
too
grainy
for
my
own
taste
a
bit
onedimensional
and
not
that
refreshing
i
will
stick
with
weizen
pretty
decent
offering
from
one
of
my
favorite
german
breweries
very
sessionable
easy
drinker
nothing
spectacular
but
just
what
i
needed
today
d
nothing
wrong
with
it
but
many
more
are
better
kind
of
a
letdown
after
tasting
many
of
hackerpschorrs
other
lager
offerings
golden
yellow
with
thick
head
that
dissipates
to
reveal
lacing
around
the
glass
aroma
and
tatse
of
sweet
grainy
malts
so
clean
perfect
viscosity
in
the
mouth
lets
you
know
you
are
not
drinking
water
but
overall
thin
enough
and
dry
enough
to
be
sooo
drinkable
begs
me
to
ask
the
question
where
are
the
good
american
lagers
i
need
to
seek
them
out
pours

expected

mouthfeel
is
light
and
lively
with
a
fairly
clean
finish
simple
and
refreshing
if
the
bottle
was
past
its
prime
its
difficult
to
tell
this
beer
pours
a
clear
golden
yellow
out
of
the
bottle
leaving
a
very
small
white
head
that
quickly
fades
it
smells
very
faintly
of
hops
its
a
light
smell
almost
fruit
like
this
beer
has
a
very
smooth
flavor
again
with
a
faint
hoppiness
the
mouthfeel
is
just
right
for
this
style
of
beer
smooth
and
refreshing
this
is
a
very
drinkable
beer
d
i
really
wish
that
our
big
breweries
would
brew
beer
on
a
regular
basis
that
resembled
this
its
a
well
balanced
brew
which
has
a
nice
texture
and
is
very
easy
to
drink
the
alcohol
is
very
well
hidden
and
as
this
style
is
meant
to
be
is
like
a
mild
pilsner
i
recommend
this
beer
to
anyone
who
doesnt
want
the
strong
flavors
but
wants
something
of
substance
d
this
is
a
decent
helles
lager
goes
down
easy
but
nothing
about
it
really
stands
out
d
this
beer
has
character
for
how
mellow
it
is
easy
to
drink
inexpensive
and
very
tasty
this
is
a
session
beer
if
i
have
ever
experienced
one
this
beer
rocks
dude
drinkability
its
a
great
beer
to
drink
if
youre
into
something
different
but
if
you
want
to
go
cheaper
you
can
go
with
becks
since
it
tastes
similar
to
becks
but
i
would
really
recommend
this
beer
to
a
friend
and
have
done
it
these
go
down
easy
and
are
not
filling

twelve
with

felt
fine
the

drinkability
ive
drunk
a
lot
of
this
stuff
always
comes
at
a
good
price
and
never
lets
you
down
i
suspect
this
is
what
kokanee
and
a
lot
of
other
big
names
are
trying
and
failing
to
be
overall
a
tasty
session
lager
with
above
average
hop
flavour
and
bitterness
but
im
not
sure
how
this
beer
differs
from
their
regular
edelhell
or
the
oktoberfest
lager
all
three
beers
are
virtually
identical
imo
as
well
i
expected
a
solid
appearance
from
this
brew
with
better
head
retention
and
lots
of
lace
i
didnt
get
it
still
a
great
lager
and
one
of
the
best
beers

with

for
the

this
beer
is
not
intense
tasting
beer
but
its
easy
to
quaff
and
has
good
flavor
all
around
at
first
i
was
not
impressed
with
this
lager
but
as
the
glass
emptied
i
came
to
feel
that
another
wouldnt
be
such
a
bad
idea
this
is
a
decent
lager
a
simple
tried
and
true
formula
while
its
not
an
exciting
or
complex
beer
it
succeeds
on
many
levels
including
a
substantial
mouthfeel
on
top
of
a
nice
clean
taste
certainly
drinkable
go
ahead
try
one
sometime
its
a
slightly
better
euro
pale
lager
drinkable
it
tastes
good
but
the
aroma
leaves
me
wanting
id
love
to
try
this
fresh
because
even
though
the
label
says
this
is
good
for
another
ten
months
it
tastes
a
bit
stale
overall
this
is
another
great
bier
from
hackerpschorr
and
one
that
all
must
try
do
yourself
a
favor
and
pick
up
a
few
of
these
and
enjoy
prosit
another
pleasant
german
helles
to
add
to
the
list
it
was
easy
to
get
a
light
airy
head
out
of
this
one
quite
bubbly
in
the
glass
dark
lemon
in
color
with
citrus
and
pepper
in
the
aroma
light
lemony
taste
a
bit
of
straw
and
malt
sweetness
that
is
cut
by
more
pepper
fizzy
body
that
fits
right
in
on
your
front
porch
on
a
warm
summer
night
not
a
stunner
but
a
clean
nobrainer
lager
that
has
earned
a
place
in
the
regular
weekday
rotation
overall
its
not
quite
at
the
pinnacle
of
the
muenchener
helles
variety
but
it
is
solid
easy
to
find
highly
drinkable
another
winner
form
munich
drinkability
here
is
awesome
this
might
be
a
bit
to
sharp
to
pair
with
some
food
but
it
was
great
with
salad
and
corn
on
the
cob
pours
golden
with
fast
disapearing
white
head
average
mouthfeel
malty
aroma
easy
drinking
subtle
grassy

looking
for
something
more
interesting
usually
crisp

still
refreshing
lightly
sweet
in
finish
decent
german
the
beer
store
this
helles
pours
a
near
crystal
clear
bright
gold
with
a
slightly
offwhite
1
and
12
inch
head
that
reduces
to
a
film
grassy
hop
aromas
and
a
touch
of
bready
malts
emanate
from
this
brew
additionally
if
i
swirl
the
glass
and
bring
the
beer
quickly
to
my
nose
i
get
a
pleasing
aroma
of
jasmine
rice
which
is
quite
unique
and
very
inviting
flavour
is
grassy
up
front
with
a
bread
backbone
a
slight
touch
of
alcohol
and
some
very
light
caramel
notes
with
a
touch
of
grain
and
light
fruit
i
get
a
bit
of
grape
no
wait
i
think
its
the
jasmine
rice
i
detected
before
cool
i
could
be
crazy
but
i
dont
think
so
on
the
finish
a
nice
crisp
breadiness
lingers
on
for
a
good
while
mouthfeel
is
light
and
crisp
with
a
subtle
spicy
prickly
character
that
cleans
the
palate
an
leaves
a
nice
and
dry
sensation
in
my
mouth
this
is
a
pretty
good
helles
lager
that
is
highly
drinkable
and
quite
refreshing
an
ideal
summer
lager
nice
and
light
but
not
too
light
and
more
flavourful
than
your
typical
macro
i
would
definitely
buy
this
again
very
nice
would
have
to
watch
it
as
a
session
beer
given
the
high
abv
but
very
drinkable
notes
over
all
a
nice
refreshing
beer
i
know
this
lager
was
a
little
bit
on
the
old
side
and
i
thick
thats
why
i
got
the
small
particles
however
the
flavor
was
bright
and
crisp
with
no
off
flavors
i
might
keep
some
in
the
fridge
for
after
mowing
the
lawn
overall
i
really
like
this
juice
make
no
mistake
this
beer
tastes
better
in
germany
that
said
it
tastes
pretty
good
here
too
youre
not
likely
to
describe
any
beer
belonging
to
the
munich
helles
style
as
delicious
but
notwithstanding
they
can
be
very
gratifying
a
crisp
and
clean
maltiness
is
all
i
hoped
for
and
im
pleased
to
say
thats
exactly
what
i
got
hackerpschorr
is
a
quality
brewery
to
and
through
ive
yet
to
find
any
exceptions
the
taste
is
a
nice
balance
between
a
creamy
smoothness
especially
for
a
lager
with
some
bittering
grassy
hop
notes
in
the
finish
and
enough
tart
pale
malts
underneath
to
make
this
beer
easy
to
drink
refreshing
there
are
some
bready
grains
and
some
grassy
florals
in
the
middle
as
well
the
beer
has
a
touch
of
citrusy
tartness
but
again
the
beer
is
well
balanced
on
all
fronts
this
is
a
very
nice
quality
lager
the
mouthfeel
is
very
light
as
is
the
aftertaste
as
expected
the
body
of
the
beer
is
quite
light
lchaim
good
beer
but
makes
me
scratch
my
head
as
it
wasnt
quite
the
lineemupanddrainem
session
beer
i
was
kinda
hoping
for
ill
be
visting
this
one
over
and
over
until
about
the
end
of
september
when
its
time
to
start
the
trek
back
to
the
darker
beers
an
agreeably
wellrounded
german
lager
malty
and
hoppy
both
in
measured
degrees
and
a
suitably
refreshing
tipple
for
relaxing
in
some
backyard
afternoon
sunshine
prost
d
a
refreshing
beer
that
is
easy
to
drink
but
what
little
flavor
profile
it
has
isnt
very
impressive
d
highly
sessionable
goes
down
very
very
easy
however
there
is
nothing
memorable
about
it
average
and
solid
are
not
necessarily
bad
characteristics
this
one
exemplifies
both
of
those
light
almost
thin
but
quite
smooth
with
just
a
touch
of
astringency
in
the
finish
crisp

1bot
o
a
fine
beer
but
a
pretty
bland
style
on
target
just
not
the
target
im
interested
in
d
again
a
very
nice
beer
any
hackerpschorr
has
always
been
good
to
me
always
nice
to
try
at
least
one
personal
recommendation
definately
try
this
beer
im
sure
you
fall
for
it
mfd
crisp
clean
on
the
palate
and
extrememly
refreshing
i
think
i
found
my
beer
for
this
summer
the
taste
is
a
nice
good
helles
character
also
light
but
with
a
solid
character
of
toasty
grain
and
bread
with
herbs
hints
of
lemon
honey
and
pine
the
grain
and
bread
tend
to
dominate
a
bit
it
has
nice
malt
and
hop
presence
and
though
light
the
flavour
holds
up
well
and
does
not
degrade
nothing
tastes
off
or
metallic
its
a
tad
on
the
sweet
side
but
just
barely
and
its
very
pleasant
and
easy
to
drink
yet
lacks
the
great
feel
of
the
likes
of
weihenstephaner
right
in
body
and
aftertaste
too
with
a
good
maltiness
still
balanced
by
some
bitterness
d
decent
i
am
going
to
look
for
a
fresher
bottle
and
update
my
review
i
suspect
the
age
killed
the
hops
that
one
bit
of
smell
almost
had
me
convinced
that
this
would
be
terrible
but
the
taste
more
than
makes
up
for
it
would
make
an
excellent
summertime
brew
all
is
in
check
on
this
one
without
a
doubt
still
this
helles
leaves
something
to
be
desired
i
would
say
that
it
lacks
the
roundedness
and
juicyness
i
love
so
much
in
other
german
lagers
of
the
sort
this
would
be
an
easy
brew
to
session
if
youre
trying
to
get
some
macro
drinking
buddies
to
start
looking
at
better
brews
this
might
be
the
first
brew
you
give
them
to
prepare
them
for
the
better
offerings
available
just
barely
above
average
a
very
refreshing
helles
i
look
forward
to
the
summertime
to
start
enjoying
a
few
of
these
on
a
sunny
patio
would
be
a
decent
intro
to
the
style
for
those
looking
to
try
pours
a
clear
gold
with
big
white
head
smells
of
honey
and
not
much
else
but
to
its
credit
the
aroma
doesnt
have
the
artificialchemically
notes
that
i
find
in
many
other
european
lagers
tastes
of
honeyish
and
grainy
malts
that
arent
terribly
complex
but
like
the
aroma
have
an
allnatural
quality
to
them
that
sets
this
beer
a
cut
above
the
rest
my
one
and
only
bone
to
pick
with
this
beer
is
its
price
no
helles
lager
is
worth
the
nearly
10
bucks
per
six
pack
that
i
paid
to
try
it
what
id
really
like
is
to
have
this
beer
on
tap
hackerpschorr
munich
gold
is
a
triedandtrue
if
less
than
exciting
munich
helles
lager
i
have
little
doubt
that
its
much
better
and
probably
more
exciting
when
consumed
in
a
munchen
biergarten
since
1417
is
nothing
to
sneeze
at
no
gesundheits
here
this
tastes
a
lot
like
their
regular
edenhell
but
with
a
smoother
more
rounded
finish
the
beer
is
no
surprise
gold
in
colour
with
a
refreshing
saaz
nose
the
taste
is
clean
and
fairly
uncomplicated
but
with
enough
going
on
to
place
above
mere
patio
fodder
rounded
finish
with
a
bit
of
sweetness
this
is
a
nice
lager
that
scares
no
one
but
stands
up
to
scutiny
overall
a
fine
brew
easy
to
drink
and
very
clean
flavors
d
i
found
this
beer
to
be
rather
tasty
and
easy
to
drink
its
definitely
a
session
brew
it
was
surly
worth
the
try
and
i
would
drink
it
again
if
i
was
in
the
mood
for
it
this
is
just
one
solid
well
rounded
highly
quaffable
brew
goes
good
with
the
holidays
with
all
the
shellfish
pours
a
nice
pillowy
head
smells
of
slight
honey
german
hops
and
slight
citris
lemony
perhaps
great
tasting
goes
down
smoothly
with
a
bit
of
twangy
hops
on
the
back
end
nice
lacing
down
the
glass
has
a
clean
crisp
mouthfeel
to
it
it
should
be
in
everyones
fridge
easy
drinking
inoffensive
and
a
nice
example
to
pair
with
traditional
german
fare
pale

yeah
its
sweet

with
a
bit
of
dry

taste
simple
light
and
straightforward
mild
malt
sweetness
and
a
bit
of
grassy

and

the
key
here
is
balance
in
the
flavor
good
biting
crispness
on
the
tongue
but
otherwise
its
smooth
and
refreshing
d
while
im
not
a
huge
fan
of
the
style
this
was
a
nicely
done
beer
very
drinkable
mouthfeeldrinkability
smooth
and
nicely
effervescent
it
drinks
quite
well
unfortunately
the
overall
flavor
profile
dictates
my
own
drinkability
rating
and
id
go
elsewhere
for
the
perfect
munich
helles
i
could
do
without
the
gold
d
ive
had
better
and
am
not
really
enjoying
this
too
much
pours
a
light
golden
with
a
one
finger
white
head
that
fades
quickly
with
a
light
lace
on
the
glass
nose
is
weak
with
malt
and
slight
hop
aroma
taste
of
sweet
malt
slightly
bready
with
some
hops
its
light
not
much
body
to
it
good
beer
for
a
hot
day
is
the
best
i
can
say
for
it
this
is
a
good
warm
weather
beer
it
is
tasty
yet
light
i
will
definitely
be
drinking
more
of
this
next
summer
a
good
bbq
beer
refreshing
beer
that
would
go
well
with
a
bowl
of
menudo
or
some
barbacoa
burritos
smells
and
tastes
of
wheat
very
breadlike
the
translucent
yellow
color
is
barely
appetizing
very
thin
body
makes
it
easy
to
drink
not
like
a
lawnmower
but
easy
to
have
a
few
pints
at
a
bar
some
citrus
in
the
flavor
and
a
very
very
very
little
amount
of
hop
apparent
in
aftertaste
not
much
impressive
about
it
really
seems
just
like
having
a
generic
beer
crystal
clear
medpale
yellow
with
about
one
inch
of
fluffy
white
head
fair
head
retention
not
much
of
a
detectable
aroma
for
me
maybe
a
bit
of
malt
medium
body
with
medlight
carbonation
nice
taste
with
a
little
more
hops
than
malt
but
a
very
nice
balance
and
mouthfeel
a
little
alcohol
warming
as
it
was
going
down
all
in
all
a
good
beer
very
drinkable
d
a
really
great
beer
overall
i
would
happily
revisit
this
one
d
another
fine
german
beer
thats
easy
to
drink
d
tasty
goes
down
easily
not
too
filling
mild
kick
very
good
representation
of
style
this
is
a
nice
lighter
beer
with
a
little
bit
of
substance
that
it
worth
drinking
for
a
long
time
what
can
i
say
other
than
i
could
drink
a
steinfull
of
this
tasty
unadulterated
munich
helles
lager
taste
is
very
malty
and
chewy
notes
of
munich
and
crystal
malts
make
the
beer
very
heavy
a
nice
bitterness
which
is
clean
and
balances
the
malt
body
is
actually
quite
thin
for
its
malty
taste
yeast
leaves
little
taste
just
the
bottom
fermented
tastes
d
the
after
taste
makes
it
hard
for
me
to
want
more
of
this
beer
it
is
decent
but
not
a
great
german
beer
nice
beer
here
but
somehow
i
expected
more
the
beer
begins
with
a
medium
straw
color
abundance
of
carbon
dioxide
but
with
light
head
retention
and
only
a
trace
of
retention
aromas
of
pilsner
malt
set
the
tone
but
may
include
some
toasted
vienna
malt
as
well
light
hints
of
corn
and
cereal
grains
but
no
harshness
only
malty
sweet
notes
flavors
are
more
malty
than
the
aroma
suggests
impressive
here
again
hints
of
corn
dms
hide
in
the
sweetness
strong
pilsner
flavors
with
a
hint
of
maltiness
found
in
vienna
lagers
hops
are
light
maybe
too
light
and
provide
an
herbal
flavor
but
could
use
bolder
grass
flavors
and
bittering
no
real
astringency
in
the
textures
but
the
beer
weighs
a
little
heavier
on
the
toung
than
desired
certainly
a
quality
brew
here
but
the
heavy
sweetness
light
hopping
and
sulfide
notes
offers
opportunity
for
improvement
d
good
refreshing
drinkable
beer
to
sum
it
up
everthing
about
this
beer
is
just
smooth
and
great
tasting
it
puts
many
other
beers
to
shame
pours
a
golden
sunshine
not
a
lot
of
head
after
a
hard
pour
a
few
bubbles
coming
from
the
bottom
of
my
glass
the
aroma
is
a
dry
grassy
malt
with
maybe
a
hint
of
something
limey
the
first
taste
is
a
sweet
malt
then
quickly
turns
into
something
more
dry
a
little
mineraly
but
still
sweet
the
palate
is
a
weet
dry
yet
smooth
palate
great
combination
making
for
a
very
easy
to
drink
beer
good
crisp
clear
mouthfeel
leads
to
an
equally
good
level
of
drinkablity
due
to
the
relatively
low
abv
and
wonderful
clean
flavors
a
certainly
good
representation
of
the
style
recommended
d
great
drinkability
and
session
festbier
that
finishes
with
a
touch
of
soft
citrusy
lemons
and
grainy
malt
sweetness
and
perfect
balance
thoughout
the
course
of
the
drink
a
definite
recommend
the
beer
poured
a
wonderful
light
gold
with
a
white
head
the
aroma
was
of
malt
with
a
hint
of
hops
the
taste
was
a
sweet
malt
with
a
turn
to
bitter
hop
then
a
final
bit
of
sweetness
in
the
finish
that
was
not
overpowering
the
feel
was
light
and
dry
a
pretty
decent
golden
lager
worth
sampling
again
if
you
wanted
this
style
this
beer
pours
a
clear
pale
golden
color
the
head
is
massive
fluffly
and
bright
white
the
aroma
is
bready
with
hints
of
minerals
and
caramel
the
taste
is
bready
with
a
nice
but
mild
noble
hop
bit
the
mouthfeel
is
medium
bodied
with
lively
carbonation
overall
this
is
a
what
session
beers
are
all
about
the
drinkability
is
just
fine
i
only
wish
it
was
a
bit
fresher
0707
date
prosit
mk
drinkability
is
great
a
true
multiseasonal
beer
nice
darker
gold
color
definitely
darker
and
more
robust
than
american
macro
lagers
and
brewed
from
much
higher
quality
ingredients
therefore
giving
this
beer
a
pleasant
sweet
true
beer
smell
it
smells
like
a
german
lager
should
the
taste
replicates
the
smell
its
slightly
thick
and
chewy
and
sweet
but
not
too
sweet
i
think
of
a
diluted
werthers
original
hard
candy
when
i
taste
this
beer
its
quite
good
easy
to
drink
and
not
too
sweet
to
drink
in
any
quantity
delish
a
near
perfect
helles
lager
if
there
ever
was
one
drinkable
you
bet
it
is
unwholly
drinkable
really
yummy
yum
yum
opinion
this
is
a
pretty
darn
good
beer
i
like
the
dominant
malt
balance
and
the
cleanliness
of
the
whole
presentation
including
the
hops
the
finish
gets
a
little
more
harsh
on
the
palate
as
the
beer
warms
but
this
is
a
very
subtle
flaw
for
the
most
part
this
is
a
very
drinkable
and
refreshing
beer
i
would
definitely
drink
it
again
but
i
dont
know
how
much
i
will
be
seeking
this
beer
out
drinkability
very
easy
drinking
beer
you
could
pound
this
but
i
tried
to
enjoy
it
since
this
was
from
a
limited
edition
gravity
keg
a
standard
helles
lager
i
dont
mean
to
poopoo
the
style
as
its
delicate
and
hard
to
pull
off
refreshing
highly
quaffable
beer
d
exceptional
edit
it
seems
like
they
have
actually
simply
renamed
edelhell
to
be
munich
gold
in
the
us
any
who
says
that
packaging
and
advertising
cant
make
a
difference
i
couldve
sworn
i
enjoyed
edelhell
more
after
having
some
with
a
very
recent
bottling
date
im
now
a
little
more
confident
in
this
beer
the
nose
is
pretty
amazing
fresh
the
baked
bread
scent
reminds
me
of
visiting
a
german
brewery
to
me
this
what
bmc
should
taste
like
if
they
stopped
using
so
many
adjuncts
and
spent
a
little
more
on
some
decent
hops
d
a
little
less
than
average
for
a
helles
would
be
a
good
summer
beer
but
there
are
better
examples
out
there
of
this
refreshing
style
probably
wont
buy
again
mouthfeel
is
nice
and
crisp
very
drinkable
nothing
complex
about
this
its
straightforward
lager
refreshing
and
sessionable
not
bad
at
all
but
not
much
more
than
a
runofthemilltypical
helles
lager
a
decent
choice
for
an
easy
refresher
but
rather
pedestrian
solid
golden

alright

maybe
not
my
favorite
style
i
just
reviewed
two
beers
back
to
back
in
hopes
of
discovering
which
was
the
better
munich
helles
lager
i
reviewed
the
hackerpschorr
munich
gold
and
paulaner
original
munich
too
be
honest
i
could
not
find
a
difference
between
the
two
of
them
both
were
very
solid
and
good
beers
nothing
spectacular
honestly
there
is
such
subtle
differences
between
the
two
beers
that
i
ended
up
rating
them
exactly
the
same
so
i
tried
to
discover
which
is
better
and
im
sorry
to
report
there
is
not
much
a
difference
but
both
are
good
solid
beers
ran
into
the

kind
of
biscuity
with
a

match
the
flavour
of
other
helles
that
ive
had
from
smaller
breweries
overall
very
drinkable
beer
its
perfect
for
people
who
are
use
to
light
american
lagers
and
want
to
slowly
be
introduced
to
more
handcrafted
bolder
bodied
beers
also
ive
never
been
disappointed
by
hackerpschorr
they
make
great
beers
not
as
complex
as
some
of
the
others
in
this
style
it
is
a
decent
one
the
flavor
is
exceptionally
clean
if
a
tad
boring
in
the
end
grainy
lightly
sweet
malts
mild
bitterness
and
some
herbal
grassy
hops
the
mouthfeel
is
light
soft
and
wellcarbonated
very
good
cold
picked
this
up
at
maruhn
getrankemarkt
a
great
beer
store
outside
of
darmstadt
crystal
clear
straw
yellow
pour
with
quickly
fading
two
finger
head
and
minimal
lacing
pretty
typical
albeit
subdued
german
pilshelles
nose
although
not
as
grassy
as
most
with
just
a
touch
of
metal
very
nicely
balanced
perfect
combination
of
bitterness
with
just
enough
sweet
malts
very
clean
and
crisp
and
it
has
that
subtle
metallic
tinge
to
it
that
i
love
the
drinkability
is
over
the
top
i
often
find
these
helles
beers
to
be
too
sweet
for
my
taste
but
this
was
a
really
nice
change
i
actually
prefer
this
to
the
draft
versions
ive
had
at
fests
i
really
enjoyed
this
one
it
really
changed
my
perception
of
lagers
flavor
is
light
crisp
apple
tart
pear
citrus
biscuit
sour
wildflower
honey
sauerampfer
peppper
malt
the
finish
is
really
superb
crisp
carbonated
and
tingling
my
palate
is
left
tingling
with
peppery
sharpness
that
set
your
palate
perfectly
for
the
next
sip
following
a
rather
unspetacular
dab
pilsner
it
really
shows
the
difference
between
a
pils
and
helles
my
vote
is
for
the
helles
cheers
this
brew
is
soft
on
the
palate
and
wetting
as
well
moderately
carbonated
drinkability
a
good
beer
in
the
style
munich
helles
lager
man
this
is
beer
i
could
down
this
by
the
liter
its
a
perfect
balance
of
light
nutty
biscuity
malts
with
a
dash
of
spicy
hops
very
clean
flavor
and
incredibly
drinkable
its
a
shame
this
beer
or
style
isnt
very
common
or
often
this
well
made
d
very
drinkable
lager
this
and
augustiner
are
the
best
munich
has
to
offer
this
was
served
from
a
12oz
bottle
a
beautiful
golden
color
to
this
beer
and
a
frothy
white
head
it
smelled
good
with
some
spice
to
it
upon
sipping
i
noticed
a
good
amount
of
hops
in
the
beer
they
continued
to
linger
in
the
after
taste
as
well
i
had
a
couple
of
these
while
eating
a
grilled
chicken
sandwich
and
the
beers
complemented
the
chicken
very
well
a
very
smooth
beer
with
just
the
right
amount
of
character
to
it
very
good
beer
with
a
nice
mouthful
d
very
simple
up
and
down
drinking
helles
great
in
summer
session
at
the
biergarten
could
drink
all
day
without
effort
but
would
like
a
little
bit
more
character
does
the
job
and
wouldnt
pass
on
it
the
spicy
hops
reemerged
in
the
taste
but
malt
still
ran
the
show
with
bread
and
grains
dominating
my
palate
the
carbonation
was
a
little
low
and
the
feel
a
bit
thin
and
watery
i
wanted
to
like
this
beer
more
but
in
the
end
felt
like
it
lacked
that
little
something
extra
that
separates
memorable
beers
from
the
rest
immensely
drinkable
and
would
go
well
with
a
giant
brezel
no
wonder
this
stuff
sells
by
the
liter
in
the
beer
gardens
final
thought
this
is
a
real
nice
helles
which
is
hard
to
make
right
sometimes
this
one
is
in
the
top
quartile
in
my
book
this
is
a
very
representative
german
lager
in
my
opinion
it
pours
a
nice
clear
golden
color
with
a
thin
pure
white
head
there
is
very
little
lacing
the
aroma
is
one
of
grain
and
yeast
with
a
hint
of
alcohol
and
malt
it
has
a
nice
lager
flavor
but
stronger
than
most
lagers
brewed
in
the
us
it
has
that
distinctive
german
lager
flavor
that
is
very
recognizable
and
which
i
can
only
attribute
to
the
german
barley
and
malts
this
has
a
lot
of
body
for
a
lager
and
is
crisp
and
clean
it
is
also
very
smooth
with
no
real
bite
and
goes
down
very
easily
and
much
too
quickly
crystal
clear
golden
topped
with
a
fat
white
head
that
is
retained
rather
well
clean
munich
malt
aroma
with
hints
of
light
esters
and
european
hops
crisply
carbonated
and
refreshing
while
retaining
a
sturdy
medium
body
clean
and
lightly
sweet
toasted
grain
flavor
balanced
by
an
earthy
noble
hopiness
tastes
slightly
more
fruity
as
it
warms
up
but
this
is
pretty
subtle
nice
clean
lager
that
is
refreshing
and
easy
to
drink
yet
still
retains
ample
flavor
great
summer
beer
came
out
with
a
three
finger
white
contoured
head
over
clear
gold
has
a
classic
helles
mild
malty
nose
wiht
just
a
hint
of
metal
and
soap
the
mouth
is
very
too
prickly
and
light
the
taste
is
fresh
and
crisp
but
lacks
soul
as
there
is
not
a
whole
lot
of
maltiness
or
hoppiness
or
wheatiness
or
anything
else
the
finish
brings
out
a
bit
of
the
hops
but
by
then
it
is
too
late
theres
a
certain
sweetness
here
that
does
not
go
over
well
overall
this
beer
is
quite
unremarkable
very
attractive
pale
straw
color
that
highlights
the
carbonation
and
the
surprisingly
solid
white
head
musty
bready
veggie
aromas
not
really
great
or
appealing
to
me
almost
smells
like
any
other
pale
lager

surprisingly

never
has
this

true
so
much
for
me
at

in
the
beer
world
as
it
did
with
this
brew
it
had
a
nice
delicate

and
a
great

feel
not
at
all
what
i
expected
from
the
appearance
and
the

the

is
sweet
and
light
the
middle
is
very
light
with
a
slightly
watery
feel
but
it
gets
more
buttery
as
it
warms
the
finish
is
dry
and
slightly
metallic
at
cooler
temps
overall
this
is
a
decent
light
beer
very
golden
with
a
foamy
white
head
that
is
thick
and
long
lived
the
nose
is
a
pleasant
hop
with
a
strong

undertone

is
refreshing

inviting
the

a
nice
dry
beer
with
a

is

this

master
list
a
stocky

down
a

drinkability
remains

good
the
finish
is
mildly

clean
although
a
decent
helles
it
seemed
to
lack
a
bit
of

backbone
i
could
easily
drink
several
of
these
however
taste
is
light
and
refreshing
with
slight
and
smooth

bitterness
ending
with
mild

finish
body
and
mouthfeel
is
appropriate
for
the
style
drinkability
is
exceptional
somehow
the
sum
of
this
beer
is
greater
than
its
parts
after
a
long
time
of
slammin
bottles
we
decided
it
was
time
for
a
keg
of
this
beautiful
lager
then
a
piece
of
heaven
floated
onto
my
friends
deck
as
we
put
down
pitchers
of
this
excellent
brew
all
night
long
there
is
another
keg
awaiting
and
i
cannot
wait
until
then
out
of
the
keg
this
beer
is
unbelievably
smooth
and
delicious
word
to
the
wise
when
you
find
a
great
beer
get
it
in
a
keg
then
you
will
have
lived
a
happy
life
my
buds
and
i
love
this
out
of
the
bottle
so
we
ordered
a
keg
of
it
from
our
local
distributor
unbelievably
smooth
from
the
tap
and
excellent
from
the
bottle
as
well
one
of
the
best
beers
out
there
i
am
going
to
go
have
one
now
ohhhhh
mmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmm
clear
attractive
color
mercifully
subdued
carbonation
long
mouthfeel
almost
mediumbodied
not
a
bright
beer
in
malt
taste
one
with
a
long
grainy
taste
thats
slightly
strange
maybe
a
little
clovey
im
not
always
in
the
mood
but
this
tastes
good
not
a
quencher
though
notes
another
winner
from
hackerpschorr
in
my
opinion
this
beer
has
a
lot
of
mouthfeel
and
flavour
for
a
deceptively
light
in
appearance
brew
this
beer
poured
out
as
a
lightly
hazy
looking
yellow
color
with
a
white
head
on
top
the
head
settles
and
just
leaves
a
little
bit
of
white
film
over
top
of
the
beer
the
smell
of
the
brew
is
grainy
and
a
little
grassy
the
taste
of
the
beer
was
earthy
amd
a
little
on
the
sweet
side
the
finish
was
crisp
and
bitter
the
mouthfeel
was
drinkable
it
was
light
to
medium
bodied
overall
this
beer
was
pretty
good
i
would
probably
have
it
again
this
marks
my
first
munich
helles
lager
and
im
fine
with
saying
that
this
seems
like
nothing
out
of
the
ordinary
nothing
really
stood
out
to
me
that
left
me
wanting
to
seek
more
interpretations
of
this
style
with
that
being
said
it
still
is
one
up
on
any
macro
available
to
me
and
a
great
summer
quaffer
ill
stick
to
their
hefes
though
i
thought
this
brew
to
be
not
overly
impressive
but
there
was
absolutely
nothing
offensive
about
it
it
would
stand
as
a
nice
thirst
quencher
on
a
hot
summer
day
on
tap
pours
clear
yellow
with
a
smallish
white
head
that
disappears
quickly
and
leaves
very
little
lacing
very
faint
smell
that
hints
at
grain
not
much
going
on
here
similarly
unimpressive
taste
light
grain
and
thats
about
it
barely
noticeable
hop
notes
feel
is
light
and
fizzy
unoffensivei
guess
clean
is
a
nice
way
to
put
it
bland
and
characterless
and
kind
of
disappointing
maybe
this
was
an
older
keg
overall
its
not
a
bad
example
of
the
munich
helles
style
but
i
dont
think
its
a
particularly
great
one
either
its
the
sort
of
beer
i
could
see
as
easy
to
drink
lots
of
on
a
night
out
with
friends
because
its
straightforward
and
fairly
quaffable
however
for
sitting
at
home
and
considering
its
virtues
its
a
poor
choice
considering
the
cast
range
of
craft
beer
out
there
a
lawnmower
beer
down
to
the
smell
and
taste
of
grass
clippings
d
goes
down
really
well
its
got
a
nice
balance
crisp
clean
finish
makes
it
very
drinkable
tastes
of
sweet
light
malt
balanced
by
a
mild
peppery
hop
the
peppery
hop
sits
on
the
pallette
for
awhile
after
swallowing
plain
but
very
refreshing
and
very
drinkable
carbonation
is
spot
on
if
i
had
a
giant
stein
i
would
fill
it
with
this
pours
golden
yellow
very
clear
with
nice
one
finger
white
head
smell
honey
hits
the
nose
first
then
sweet
grassy
malts
come
into
play
taste
very
clean
a
bit
too
sweet
but
still
refreshing
with
bitter
finish
crisp
very
light
very
drinkable
good
beer
that
id
drink
on
a
regular
basis
drinkability
id
definately
have
this
again
its
got
some
nice
qualities
i
look
for
in
a
wheaty
beer
it
can
be
a
session
beer
for
sure
and
its
going
to
be
visiting
my
fridge
more
often
d
a
modestly
light
palate
with
an
ok
lemon
herbal
hopping
and
drinks
well
for
its
style
clean
on
the
flavor
and
finish
yeah
it
could
be
used
a
german
session
beer
for
somebody
but
not
me
for
me
one
is
more
than
enough
for
me
it
was
nothing
more
than
a
close
to
be
being
average
german
lager
im
sure
it
would
taste
much
better
ontap
at
oktoberfest
in
munich
the
beer
pours
a
pale
gold
color
with
a
thick
frothy
white
head
that
slowly
fades
to
lacing
the
aroma
is
good
it
has
a
light
pale
and
munich
malt
scent
its
sweet
with
some
breadlike
aroma
there
is
some
fruitiness
as
well
as
a
light
german
hop
presence
the
taste
is
good
this
is
a
fantastic
helles
its
smooth
with
an
excellent
malt
flavor
it
goes
down
easy
with
a
nice
munich
malt
sweetness
and
finishes
clean
with
a
dry
german
hop
bitterness
the
mouthfeel
is
great
it
is
a
medium
bodied
beer
with
adequate
carbonation
this
is
a
very
good
lager
its
pale
yet
flavorful
it
has
just
the
right
amount
of
balance
to
it
d
this
beer
is
quite
easy
to
drink
its
light
bodied
and
crisp
with
some
decent
flavour
as
well
there
are
far
better
lagers
out
there
but
i
still
find
this
one
to
be
a
refreshing
beer
to
throw
back
indeed
it
would
make
a
good
oktoberfest
beer
my
experience
with
the
style
and
the
region
is
limited
but
if
i
could
find
a
bunch
of
german
beers
at
my
local
shop
i
would
gladly
sample
them
all
first
a
good
intro
to
german
beers
if
your
shop
is
lacking
in
selection
it
exemplifies
the
pride
hacker
pschorr
takes
in
their
brewing
even
when
its
a
less
complex
recipe
d
nice
light
session
beer
this
would
be
a
fantastic
gateway
beer
if
it
werent
for
the
price
associated
very
enjoyable
light
gold
in
color
with
a
moderate
white
head
doesnt
appear
to
be
anything
special
but
the
smell
smells
like
a
good
rich
german
lager
malty
and
semi
sweet
no
skunky
smell
like
you
can
detect
in
some
of
those
green
bottle
lightpolluted
beers
like
becks
or
st
pauli
girl
this
one
has
a
brown
bottle
it
tastes
the
same
way
it
smells
perfect
carbonation
this
is
a
good
quality
example
of
what
a
german
lager
should
be
prior
to
briefly
scanning
the
reviews
of
the
three
that
ive
had
so
far
i
had
forgotten
just
how
good
hackerpschorr
beer
is
edelhell
is
the
first
one
that
hasnt
impressed
me
on
some
level
oh
well
i
dont
see
it
around
much
anyway
this
beer
is
nothing
special
and
thats
too
bad
compared
to
their
hefe
this
is
extremely
disappointing
light
bodied
tastes
bready
with
some
nice
use
of
european
hops
slightly
grassy
some
light
use
of
spices
as
well
carbonation
is
pretty
well
done
carries
the
subtle
flavors
well
and
finishes
very
crisp
a
light
drinkable
german
lager
d
while
some
of
the
offcharacteristics
are
a
little
distracting
this
is
still
a
good
drinker
and
thirst
quencher
subtle
and
refreshing
without
hitting
you
on
the
head
to
get
your
attention
overall
this
is
a
clean
inoffensive
thirstquencher
bland
and
pedestrian
but
easily
drinkable
and
suffices
as
a
nobrainer
session
brew
admittedly
i
wasnt
sold
on
the
first
bottle
of
this
that
i
tried
but
it
grew
on
me
and
now
i
find
it
rather
refreshing
still
i
think
i
prefer
the
vienna
style
of
lagers
to
this
munich
helles
style
the
beer
pours
a
lightish
yellow
or
what
some
call
straw
color
the
head
dissipates
pretty
quickly
but
there
is
some
residuals
on
the
side
of
the
glass
and
minimal
lacing
the
smell
is
the
low
mark
and
it
reminded
me
too
much
that
i
was
in
for
a
really
crappy
american
macro
the
taste
thankfully
is
better
than
the
smell
it
is
a
light
fairly
carbonated
lager
with
some
breadiness
some
wheatiness
and
spriteliness
there
is
a
little
bite
at
the
end
that
tastes
like
some
yeast
popping
through
not
much
hop
to
this
beer
very
refreshing
drinkable
light
with
a
smooth
mouthfeel
you
cant
go
wrong
but
it
isnt
a
brilliant
beer
by
any
stretch
lchaim
pours
a
clear
straw
color
with
a
nice
fluffy
white
head
that
dissipated
into
a
small
cap
leaving
not
much
lacing
the
smell
is
rather
faint
some
light
grain
and
hop
the
taste
is
light
light
hop
light

light

doesnt
have
a
pronounced

the
feel
is

and
well
carbonated

slightly

in
aftertaste
an
average
helles
but
still
a
fine
beer
and
very
drinkable
great
for
wanting
to
down
a
few
overall
a
tasty

however
the
astringency
detracts
from
the

drinkability
this
is
kind
of
a
boring
beer
but
not
at
all
hard
to
drink
tasty
just
lacking
in
character
i
love
a
good
hellas
and
this
is
a
good
one

the

accurate

pleasant
overall
everytime
i
try
a
good
hellas
i
wonder
why
so
few
good
ones
are
avail
from
us
breweries
the
closest
thing
to
this
made
near
me
is
velas
hellas
in
gatlinburg
which
is
about
equally
as
good
but
a
little
more
color
edelhell
is
crisp
and
refreshing
and
fairly
well
done
far
too
many
reviewers
take
subtle
as
bad
this
is
subtle
but
good

a

basically
this

like
a

not

else
there
an

lager
but
nothing
extraordinary
an

nothing

probably
not

i
would

again

it

a
tasty
thirst
quencher
for
sure
a
very
average
german
helles
or
rather
i
think
what
i
mean
to
say
is
german
helles
is
a
very
average
style
this
is
a
strong
example
though
poured
a
light
yellow
big
head
left
good
lacing
simple
flavour
nothing
all
that
paletable
but
easy
to
drink
texture
is
alittle
thick
not
exactly
a
favourable
aroma
but
again
nothing
offensive
its
got
a
little
more
definition
than
most
pale
euro
lagers
which
i
think
places
it
a
little
above
this
beer
is
what
it
is
simple
and
agreeable
d
soooo
drinkable
i
drank
it
during
the
whole
game
and
then
later
during
the
mexicoargentina
game
overall
a
pretty
good
example
of
the
style
i
would
love
to
try
this
fresh
or
gasp
on
tap
drinkability
overall
good
drinkability
d
this
beer
has
nice
fresh
tasting
ingredients
that
has
a
good
complexity
for
such
a
light
beer
this
is
a
really
well
crafted
beer
and
is
proof
that
a
light
beer
can
have
good
flavor
i
could
drink
this
for
session
if
it
was
the
beer
of
offering
and
i
have
at
our
keg
party
as
well
as
at
hagerstowns
schnamkerlstube
bavarian
restaurant
which
is
where
i
just
had
this
and
upon
which
i
am
basing
the
review
this
is
a
crowd
beer
that
im
not
very
fond
of
too
much
of
a
corn
taste
that
lingers
along
the
tongue
and
makes
me
want
to
get
a
different
brew
asap
overall
refreshing
stuff
perfect
balance
with
a
lovely
crisp
finish
good
stuff
on
a
hot
sunny
day
if
only
they
could
get
rid
of
that
feint
corny
odor
in
the
nose
theres
nothing
complex
about
this
helles
but
the
style
is
not
one
that
lends
itself
to
complexity
its
refreshing
and
quite
drinkable
with
no
flaws
among
the
imports
to
america
this
beats
spatens
and
paulaners
offerings
mine
got
admittedly
a
bit
warm
and
i
think
you
should
stay
cold
with
this
one
i
t
goes
down
so
easy
it
wont
have
a
chance
to
get
warm
bangers
on
the
grill
some
red
cabbage
perhaps
some
german
potato
salad
mit
onion
for
this
one
overall
the
taste
isnt
overwhelmed
with
flavor
but
still
very
thirst
quenching
clean
and
refreshing
but
doesnt
sacrifice
other
taste
qualities
clear
pale
gold
thin
dirty
white
head
nice
looking
streams
of
co2
surface
at
a
moderate
rate
aroma
is
a
little
bready
a
little
grainy
even
a
little
biscuity
pretty
cool
light
but
nice
first
impression
is
sweet
and
grainy
but
theres
also
some
light
crackery
like
pilsner
maltiness
too
and
theres
a
bit
of
a
dry
snap
on
the
finish
a
hoppy
snap
subtle
but
definitely
there
i
think
were
talking
about
some
noble
hops
here
nice
drinker
medium
bodied
refreshing
hackerpschorr
munich
edel
hell
is
one
of
my
favorite
beers
and
is
a
prime
example
of
a
münchner
helles
clean
malty
and
just
enough
hop
character
to
balance
the
malt
and
make
it
refreshing
this
beer
is
definitely
sessionable
one
can
see
why
so
many
mass
krüge
of
helles
are
consumed
in
beer
gardens
across
germany
if
you
are
interested
in
this
style
and
have
not
yet
tried
this
beer
i
highly
recommend
it
if
someone
wants
to
know
what
a
munich
light
lager
tastes
like
simply
tell
them
it
tastes
like
hackerpschorr
edelhell
what
all
r
light
real
lager
should
taste
like
in
all
its
smooth
subtle
drinkable
maltaccented
glory
very
drinkable
but
i
may
chose
something
a
little
more
bold
mk
pours
a
crystal
clear
yellow
color
nice
head
good
lacing
down
the
glass
problem
is
it
was
skunky
and
the
taste
although
slightly
crisp
and
sweet
was
a
bit
of
the
same
its
not
a
bad
brew
but
there
are
many
other
germans
out
there
that
are
much
better
notes
really
an
easy
drinking
brew
that
is
interesting
yet
light
a
rare
combination
for
a
lager
wished
i
could
get
this
on
tap
somewhere
preferably
in
germany
oh
well
for
now
the
bottle
is
worth
every
penny
d
not
too
fond
of
it
there
are
better
lagers
out
there
this
one
ranks
just
about
average
wouldnt
mind
trying
it
ontap
sometime
but
for
now
ill
stick
to
the
hefeweizen
a
quality
brew
and
a
nice
example
of
the
style
though
not
as
clean
and
malty
as
some
an
amazing
beer
on
tap
at
beerbistro
pours
a
clear
goldenstraw
yellow
big
fluffy
white
head
some
spots
of
lace
and
good
retention
smell
is
sweet
and
malty
some
caramel
and
honey
light
citrus
and
floral
in
the
finish
taste
is
sweet
and
malty
as
well
honey
citrus
and
a
little
wheat
mouthfeel
is
medium
to
light
bodied
with
medium
carbonation
very
smooth
pretty
standard
although
good
this
beer
can
be
described
as
an
average
beer
i
have
had
better
than
this
in
this
style
but
i
have
also
had
worse
i
would
drink
it
again
thx
tastes
good
clean
and
refreshing
with
little
aftertaste
but
its
a
little
lacking
in
body
pretty
watery
carbonation
is
not
overabundant
which
makes
it
kind
on
the
palate
and
goes
down
quite
easily
not
a
bad
beer
overall
would
likely
go
well
with
a
side
of
sauerkraut
and
sausages
overall
impression
simple
clean
straightforward
beer
nothing
too
complex
or
complicated
this
style
is
fast
becoming
one
of
my
favorites
and
this
is
a
prime
example
for
sure
very
nice
so
nice
to
know
that
you
wont
be
getting
that
adjunct
taste
with
a
german
beer
miles
ahead
of
any
american
macro
tasty
stuff
a
bit
of
a
toostrong
carbonation
for
my
taste
but
very
drinkable
better
than
average
id
say
something
is
off
from
the
get
go
the
color
is
paler
and
considerably
more
muddled
then
i
would
like
to
see
the
aroma
is
overly
malted
with
a
sort
of
rotten
hay
malt
its
sweet
and
sweaty
something
that
carries
over
from
the
nose
and
into
the
taste
a
considerable
amount
of
spicy
hops
are
also
in
there
somewhere
and
do
well
for
the
mouthfeel
in
the
finish
but
they
dont
help
the
taste
enough
to
make
this
one
pleasurable
to
drink
decent
but
not
clean
or
crisp
enough
for
me
to
sweet
and
wet
to
be
very
drinkable
d
i
could
easily
have
another
couple
of
these
it
isnt
amazing
but
it
would
be
good
for
a
session
bland
taste
a
mix
of
yeasty
bread
grassy
hops
and
corn
not
terribly
bad
but
not
overly
exciting
this
has
potential
but
unfortunately
fails
to
live
up
to
my
expectations
this
could
have
been
great
but
to
me
comes
off
as
nothing
more
than
a
bland
lager
this
isnt
a
bad
beer
but
i
dont
think
its
place
is
on
a
quiet
evening
in
better
to
have
this
beer
while
chatting
with
a
group
of
friends
with
my
full
attention
on
it
i
am
a
little
bored
d
nothing
offensive
but
nothing
to
really
appeal
to
the
beer
geek
this
is
a
nice
lager
though
it
could
use
some
more
flavor
still
its
way
better
than
becks
or
grolsch
pours
out
a
vibrant
clear
medium
gold
a
tall
white
head
that
recedes
after
a
short
while
leaving
small
patches
of
lacing
here
and
there
the
nose
while
not
overly
complex
is
what
it
should
be
mild
grains
some
biscuity
malt
and
rounded
off
with
floral
meadowy
hops
nothing
seems
out
of
place
the
flavour
itself
starts
out
with
crisp
dry
grains
a
bit
of
biscuit
in
the
middle
that
joins
up
with
some
grassy
hops
that
lead
it
to
finish
of
sweet
cut
grass
and
a
lingering
moist
grainy
aftertaste
crisp
but
only
becoming
dry
well
along
the
aftertaste
the
mouthfeel
for
the
most
part
is
also
crisp
and
dry
and
very
thirstquenching
this
would
make
a
wonderful
patio
beer
on
hot
summer
days
a
good
way
to
classup
some
barbecuing
as
well
a
style
and
an
effort
that
could
very
easily
slip
under
the
radar
as
it
is
not
very
robust
or
boisterous
in
its
flavours
but
everything
is
done
well
and
is
in
the
right
place
a
fine
lager
that
ill
being
buying
more
of
while
the
weather
still
lasts
500ml

a
picture
of

traditional

on

felt
right
to
pour
it

it
formed
a
perfect
size
of
fluffy

a
mixture
of
bubbles
and
sometimes
it
appeared
quite
creamy
other
times
a

very

sticky

the
foam

settled
on

and
stayed
quite
consistent

dense

very
good
appearance
and
a
thirsty
mans
dream
grassy
bits
of
malt
in
the
aroma
with
good
breadiness
and
some
floral
hoppiness
to
fit
the
style
i
think
i
prefer
the
more
subdued
hoppiness
of
helles
to
pilsner
some
creamy
caramel
notes
a
little
vanilla
and
german
hops
which
give
some
herbal
and
slightly
bitter
metallic
aromas
biscuity
and
like
cereal
grainy
there
is
definitely
a
little
fruitiness
in
this
aroma
as
well
which
was
kind
of
pleasantly
surprising
mango
or
pear
mostly
green
apples
too
reminding
me
of
some
hefes
i
found
many
german
pale
lagers
actually
had
alelike
fruitiness
when
i
was
over
there
and
this
reminds
me
a
bit
of
some
a
piquant
aroma
that
is
extremely
appetising
a
delight
in
the
mouth
too
instead
of
the
expected
bitterness
we
might
expect
from
a
beer
this
colour
thinking
it
will
be
similar
to
pilsnerstyle
i
get
more
of
the
fruitiness
along
with
lightly
roasted
maltiness
the
breadiness
is
all
up
front
like
sweet
bread
cinnamon
buns
or
a
little
brown
sugar
the
hops
are
always
there
but
they
play
second
fiddle
to
the
other
tastes
and
the
finish
of
this
beer
is
supremely
balanced
by
apple
honeyish
malt
and
a
little
metallic
tang
dryness
in
the
middle
i
sense
a
little
of
the
alcohol
the
aftertaste
is
definitely
bitter
but
not
in
the
pilsner
waythis
is
more
balanced
other
flavours
include
a
little
pineapple
some
tomatojuice
tanga
little
and
some
malty
sourness
not
overly
complex
but
fitting
and
worthy
of
its
style
the
mouthfeel
is
lightly
carbonated
for
the
style
quite
foamy
and
velvety
on
the
mouthno
real
sparkling
or
crisp
carbonation
which
is
nice
mediumbodied
and
endlessly
quaffable
a
helles
i
would
buy
againwhen
summer
returns
one
fantastic
munich
style
helles
lager
i
have
yet
to
run
in
to
one
i
havent
liked
from
germany
and
this
one
is
no
different
yum
its
only
downfall
is
its
5

abv
it
does
catch
up
to
ya
after
a
few
pretty
quickly
as
it
goes
down
way
too
damn
easily
mow
em
if
ya
got
em
and
drink
up
this
beer
poured
a
crystal
clear
golden
color
with
a
white
head
about
an
inch
tall
the
aroma
is
a
little
bit
grassy
with
some
malt
and
some
hop
aroma
the
taste
is
sweet
with
light
malt
infused
with
some
mild
hop
bitterness
decent
mouthfeel
high
carbonation
makes
you
pace
yourself
lightmedium
body
its
a
good
drinkable
beer
itd
beer
perfect
for
a
night
of
playing
cards
aroma
is
a
wonderful
blend
of
creamy
malt
and
spicy
hops
the
flavor
and
texture
are
superb
maltiness
hop
flavors
bitterness
residuals
and
alcohol
are
all
in
perfect
balance
to
one
another
you
just
cant
ask
for
much
more
from
a
helles
it
is
easy
to
drink
yet
it
has
a
definite
personality
and
pulls
no
punches
in
terms
of
alcohol
5
5
abv
or
bitterness
even
after
three
or
four
in
a
row
this
beer
loses
nothing
through
repetition
its
one
of
my
favorite
session
beers
when
reasonably
fresh
this
beer
produced
a
twofinger
creamy
head
on
top
of
a
highly
carbonated
clear
brassy
colored
beer
aromas
of
hops
and
grass
were
detected
taste
was
sweet
fruity
malt
which
yielded
to
breadiness
a
balanced
mouthfeel
not
a
bad
beer
pretty
good
actually
pours
a
pale
clear
straw
colour
with
a
decent
two
finger
head
that
head
does
quickly
disipate
to
a
thin
film
but
still
leaves
behind
a
decent
amount
of
lace
simplistic
smell
herbs
and
grass
with
a
little
bit
of
malt
taste
is
primarily
grassy
hops
reminds
me
of
mowing
the
lawn
tasty
but
plain
mouthfeel
is
clean
crisp
plain
and
dull
drinkable
as
a
refresher
but
overall
simply
too
plain
thin
and
grainy
up
front
good
malt
down
the
middle
decent
aromas
of
grassy
hops
and
malt
easy
to
drink
competent
without
being
someting
to
get
too
worked
up
about
good
summer
beer
id
say
medium
body
with
nice
fizziness
nice
warming
alcohol
content
but
not
too
much
this
is
a
very
enjoyable
and
refreshing
brew
i
wish
i
had
another
right
now
i
have
beern
on
the
quest
lately
to
find
the
perfect
summer
beer
and
a
lot
of
lagers
seem
to
be
on
the
liqour
store
shelves
right
now
this
is
one
of
the
better
lagers
to
pass
my
lips
in
quite
awhile
pale
gold
with
a
big
head
this
beer
combines
drinkability
with
a
solid
midbody
and
finish
good
use
of
hops
in
a
beer
of
this
style
i
will
be
consuming
some
more
of
these
guys
while
the
sun
shines
bottled
pours
clear
gold
with
a
small
rocky
white
head
that
fades
rapidly
into
a
thin
film
spotty
lacing
that
crawls
slowly
back
into
the
brew
aromas
of
grass
tart
apples
and
sour
malt
wheat
and
yeast
combine
to
great
youcwith
the
first
drink
and
then
it
finishes
slightly
hoppy
and
spicy
buttery
mouthfeel
that
is
also
fizzy
refreshing
and
light
bodied
light
yellow
gold
with
a
midsized
white
head
malty
grain
scents
that
are
about
what
one
would
expect
from
the
style
nothing
new
and
exciting
about
it
taste
is
crisp
light
malt
with
just
a
small
hop
bite
flavor
is
kind
of
thin
but
it
is
clean
and
nice
i
wouldnt
mind
a
cooler
of
these
on
a
hot
day
alright
beer
nothing
i
would
buy
if
i
could
see
something
better
sitting
around
though
pours
a
bit
on
the
thin
side
with
a
flaxen
appearance
the
head
is
on
the
thin
side
although
the
smell
is
quite
nice
and
sweet
the
flavor
is
a
bit
on
the
bitter
side
with
strong
floral
overtones
a
decent
enjoyable
beer
which
would
be
a
great
companion
to
a
warm
summer
night
12oz
bottle
this
one
poured
a
slightly
pale
golden
color
it
was
crystalclear
there
was
a
large
white
head
to
it
but
when
i
turned
around
it
was
gone
the
aroma
is
a
bit
thin
but
pleasant
there
are
some
floral
notes
and
some
sweetness
to
it
the
taste
is
pleasant
also
this
is
a
nice
helles
clear
golden
color
with
a
large
foamy
head
bubbles
continue
to
rise
for
several
minutes
pleasant
citrus
aroma
crisp
malty
flavor
with
spicy
hops
thin
to
medium
mouthfeel
high
level
of
carbonation
a
tasty
crisp
lager
thats
easy
drinking
yet
avoids
being
boring
a
good
choice
if
you
want
a
refreshing
beer
dhell
yeah
these
are
consumable
in
large
quantities
this
is
a
very
clean
brew
nice
balance
of
malt
and
hops
grassy
and
sweet
up
front
with
just
the
slightest
bitter
hop
finish
honeylike
sweetness
at
times
good
drinkability
level
this
could
be
a
great
session
beer
if
you
enjoy
german
lagers
almost
like
eating
fat
frosted
liquid
sugar
cookies
made
with
olive
oil
instead
of
butter
and
flecked
with
tiny
bits
of
fresh
oregano
while
sitting
across
the
room
from
a
gas
fire
below
an
iron
plate
of
roasting
hazelnuts
but
different
presentation
12oz
brown
bottle
freshness
dated
1104
poured
like
liquid
gold
into
a
14oz
pilsner
glass
where
it
would
rest
only
momentarily
two
finger
offwhite
head
smells
like
a
loaf
of
fresh
bread
maybe
a
light
rye
and
grassy
hops
the
first
taste
displays
the
delicate
toasted
malt
that
lends
a
subtle
light
honeylike
sweetness
hops
are
brisk
peppery
and
spicy
some
lemon
hop
notes
are
underlying
this
is
incredibly
fresh
the
texture
is
creamy
smooth
and
somehow
shifts
to
crisp
and
thirst
quenching
i
was
impressed
with
this
brew
i
appreciated
its
simplicity
and
its
outstanding
drinkability
i
will
buy
this
again
the
departs
the
355ml
brown
bottle
and
takes
up
residence
in
my
glass
a
crystal
clear
gold
color
with
a
massive
bright
white
head
and
lots
of
fine
lace
which
desiccates
to
sticky
clumps
upon
the
glass
nose
is
malt
fresh
clean
and
crisp
front
is
mostly
malt
and
somewhat
sweet
the
top
is
reedy
the
finish
bitingly
acidic
pleasantly
hopped
with
a
dry
somewhat
bitter
aftertaste
quite
quaffable
and
one
of
the
handful
of
lagerspils
i
can
call
delectable
it
poured
a
beautiful
clear
golden
with
a
nice
white
head
the
dissipated
quickly
the
aroma
is
pretty
straight
forward
maltbeer
smell
no
promises
and
no
warnings
the
taste
is
sharp
and
hoppy
with
a
malty
undertone
the
malt
does
break
out
at
times
and
give
a
range
of
sweet
flavors
in
the
finish
to
me
the
taste
is
better
with
food
as
this
beer
is
quite
clarifying
the
feel
is
pretty
much
a
nice
moderately
dry
and
light
beer
definately
a
well
made
beer
but
not
one
that
would
attract
me
to
come
back
too
often
had
3
years
later
in
a
bottle
and
impressions
were
a
bit
better
where
moderate
bitterness
comes
through
and
creamy
clear
pale
golden
colour
bright
white
head
that
didnt
last
long
and
produced
no
lace
light
spicy
nose
with
just
a
hint
of
malt
bitterness
and
malt
sweetness
are
well
balanced
resulting
in
a
crisp
clean
finish
complemented
by
a
light
sourness
fairly
light
body
without
being
watery
not
bad
and
definitely
something
id
try
again
german
pilsners
are
so
different
than
what
yanks
are
used
to
theres
no
overwhelming
hit
of
corn
in
the
taste
here
a
slight
burn
from
the
bubbles
a
mellow
and
lovely
deliverance
of
that
malt
and
hop
promise
in
the
nose
and
then
nothing
leaves
the
tastebuds
clean
practically
scoured
this
would
be
a
lovely
way
to
cleanse
the
palate
between
cheese
tastings
but
dangerous
as
i
could
see
myself
unthinkingly
downing
4
or
5
all
in
a
rush
i
would
be
less
inclined
to
reach
for
the
english
ales
and
darker
brews
if
more
pilsners
were
this
fine
not
as
impressive
as
hb
original
next
up
paulaner
munich
original
premium
lager
this
is
one
of
the
best
beers
of
the
münchner
helles
style
that
ive
had
not
in
the
least
bit
complex
but
a
good
quencher
and
the
malt
flavors
there
are
very
enjoyable
a
nicely
balanced
brew
altogether
pours

pale

finish
is
clean
and
moderately
hoppy
light
bodied
soft
and
extremely
drinkable
theres
nothing
extraordinary
or
remarkable
about
this
beerit
is
however
a
solidly
quaffable
refreshing
brew
very
drinkable
without
being
bland
not
the
best
but
a
very
solid
beer

the

a
highlight
here
wavering
constantly
between

always
staying
clean

easy
on

with
a
dryness
that
is
slightly
bitter
but
is
fruity
in
a
strange
nonsweet
way
i
could
drink
these
all
afternoon
a
very
refreshing
bavarian
lager
here
that
hits
all
the
right
notes
for
the
style

color
with
a
creamy

of

nothing

strong
has
a

leaves
you
with

very
smooth

a
good
beer
probably
even
better

warm

well
the
pour
was
a

with

very
minimal

the
carbonation
goes
on
forvever
little
bubbles
very
active
through
the
whole
brew
not
a
whole
lot
going
on
in
the
aroma
department
a
little
bit
of
malt
but
most
notable
was
the
fresh
haygrass
smell
add
some
grain
in
there
and
that
sums
it
up
the
taste
was
fairly
refreshing
although
not
real
flavorful
first
impression
is
the
little
bit
of
malt
that
comes
through
followed
by
a
very
grainy
taste
almost
a
bit
of
corn
in
the
finish
that
leaves
a
subpar
aftertaste
mouthfeel
is
pretty
thin

this
beer
isnt
terrible
sort
of
refreshing
a
high
quality
german
lager
i
love
german
beer
even
rgular
ol
lagers
are
tasty
this
is
a
bright

very
clear
and
clean
looking
whisp

on
top
nose
is
spicy
hops
almost
saaz
like
also
some
grassy
notes
on
the
nose
very
nice
sweet
malty
for
a
lager
flavor
mouthfeel
is
about
perfect
for
this
style
finishes
with
the
saaz
like
hops
a
very
enjoyable
tasty
lager
for
a
lager
this
is
close
to
outstanding
this
beer
brought
me
back
i
remember
when
i
had
my
first
becks
or
st
pauli
girl
this
was
it
in
its
purest
form
golden
with
a
nice
head
this
beer
did
not
pretend
to
be
anything
than
what
it
was
a
good
beer
with
good
malts
good
hops
it
was
refreshingly
good
i
was
back
in
my
youth
when
a
new
beer
tasted
crisp
and
nonindustrial
this
was
that
beer
this
german
classic
tastes
like
beer
thats
right
beer
after
a
long
cold
winter
and
spring
of
drinking
imperial
stouts
baltic
porters
barley
wines
strong
trappists
ales
and
such
its
a
real
joy
to
welcome
in
the
sun
and
a
simple
easygoing
beer
no
chocolate
coffee
berries
raisins
smoked
wood
bananas
or
fruit
soaked
in
rum
nor
overly
flamed
crème
brulee
just
beerbeer
a
nice
white
head
rests
atop
the
shiny
gold
body
the
lace
clings
for
a
while
then
slides
into
obscurity
a
real
beer
aroma
of
malt
hops
yeast
and
alcohol
are
easy
to
identify
the
herbal
malt
body
is
more
substantial
than
it
appears
and
reveals
a
slightly
grainy
and
lightly

o
i
picked
this
up
thinking
it
was
augustiner
hell
alas
no
still
its
a
decent
lager
and
an
overpriced
one
too
simply
for
that
i
wont
buy
again
unless
of
course
i
somehow
mistake
it
for
augustiner
hell
again
it
has
been
a
couple
years
but
as
i
recall
this
beer
reminds
me
of
amstel
light
maybe
a
little
more
alcohol
than
amstel
not
bad
but
im
glad
i
didnt
love
it
because
this
aint
no
cheap
beer
i
think
i
paid
13
for
a
six
pack
i
guess
my
quest
for
a
great
light
beer
will
go
on
i
really
enjoy
this
beer
it
has
a
nice
color
and
pours
easy
with
a
half

actually
began

in

mood
pours
out

managed
to
leave
some
good

down
the

throughout
the
session

and
easy
on
the
palate
in

way

is
just
sweet

a
light
and
easy
going
feel
and
smooth
clean
finish
that
has
just
a
hint
of
dryness
to
it
remarkably
drinkable
this
is
a
soft
and
smooth
lager
that
i
cant
imagine
anyone
passing
up
even
those
who
love
the
more
bitter
and
hoppy
german
lagers
from
the
north
mouthfeel
is
very
nice
not
too
full

extremely
drinkable
d
absolutely
this
is
a
very
good
drinking

good

very
healthy
level

ice
cold
on
a
hot

taste
is
pretty
nice
bready
sweetness
but
light
crisp
tasting
and
pretty
good
per
style
i
would
drink
this
one
again
d
nothing
special
easy
drink
but
a
weak
lager
and
not
what
i
expected
from
it
mostly
carbonation
and
lack
of
any
strong
flavors
dthis
could
be
a
great
session
beer
or
maybe
is
before
it
makes
its
trip
across
the
atlantic
but
there
is
a
slight
sweetness
that
makes
this
beer
stick
around
on
the
palate
too
long
d
not
bad
in
the
since
that
theres
nothing
particularly
off
about
this
one
at
the
same
time
theres
nothing
memorable
about
it
either
interesting
to
try
a
moreauthentic
german
take
on
the
light
lager
category
but
not
something
id
pick
up
again

it
can
catch
us
quick
ive
been
drinking
this
stuff
since
i
got
back
from
oktoberfest
but
its
nothing
like
the
augustiner
you
get
in

still
nice
beer
with
amazing
flavors
sure
tastes

and
refreshing

give
me
a
cold
case
of
this
an
a
warm
summer
day
and
im
in
heaven
had
a
bottle
of
this
this
past
weekend
at
the
sunset
no
freshness
date
so
maybe
i
was
taking
a
chance
but
luckily
the
brown
bottle
was
there
to
help
i
have
to
say
this
beer
tasted
mighty
fresh
clear
light
gold
with
a
thin
white
head
original
impression
of
some
sweet
corn
like
notes
in
the
aroma
not
offputting
later
evolved
into
some
more
grapeskin
like
complexity
is
that
munich

cool
beer
was
light
and
darn
easy
to
drink
a
real
session
brew
some
sweetness
not
over
the
top
thank
god
with
some
pleasant
toast
points
in
the
finish
this
brew
has
a
light
body
which
wont
win
you
over
in
the
mouthfeel
department
not
much
to
say
about
flavor
except
that
each
drink
ends
with
an
astringent
twang
very
steel
like
save
your
money
for
a
beer
that
actually
has
some
flavor
this
is
a
beer
i
would
go
to
if
were
going
to
have
a
few
but
not
a
bunch
and
was
in
the
mood
for
a
nice
quaffable
lager
i
could
see
it
being
a
great
pair
with
spicy
vietnamese
or
thai
food
the
small
fizzy
white
bubbly
head
dies
fast
leaving
nothing
but
a
glass
full
of
dirty
gold
liquid
just
a
little
hazy
there
is
some
tangy
fruit
in
the
nose
with
some
nice
schpoonk
a
little
corn
syrup
fruity
in
the
front
roasty
crackers
it
gets
quite
malty
in
the
middle
finishing
crisply
bitter
with
some
corn
its
a
tasty
light
lager
enough
malt
and
some
nice

lemony

pretty

nice

thick
faded

eventually
leaving

not
much
in

flavor
department
maybe
a
little
wheat
with
a
splash
of
lemon
very
light
body
clean
finish
this
would
be
very
refreshing
served
nice
and
cold
on
a

day
but
otherwise
just
pick
up
a
busch
and
rub
a
lemon
around
the
edge
of
the
can
i
dont
see
the
fuss
with
this
one
there
are
better
macro
lagers
in
my
opinion

kills
a

of

the
perfect
munich
helles
lager
to
bad
cant
find
it
in
the
states
but
always
a
treat
when
visiting
germany
as
for
me
a
beer
of
pure
perfection
a
light
yellow
golden
beer
with
a
white
medium

the
aroma
is
typically

and
malty

aroma
balanced
with
the

grassy

modest
bitterness
and
carbonation
combine
nicely
in
this
beer
some
seawater
peanut
and
cereals
no
doubt
best
helles
and
one
of
best
beer
generally
i
am
a
little
bit
disappointed
about
this
beer
this
beer
isnt
good
as
everyone
says
at
least
to
my
palate
it
is
really
good
for
a
lager
though
this
is
the
benchmark
for
lagers
hands
down
having
used
to
think
weihenstephaner
original
was
the
prototype
a
visit
to
münchen
and
a
few
dozen
of
these
over
my
visit
thoroughly
changed
my
mind
the
absolute
definition
of
balance
and
drinkability
without
tasting
simply
watered
down
not
overly
sweet
nor
overly
hopped
like
many
helles
particularly
american
clones
all
hail
the
standard
bearer
for
the
type
the
greatest
shame
is
that
this
brew
is
not
exported
whatsoever
the
augustiner
edelstoff
is
not
up
to
par
overall
a
refreshing
brew
with
nice
subtleties
this
is
the
best
beer
ive
ever
had
if
you
are
lucky
enough
to
come
across
this
beer
especially
outside
germany
buy
all
that
you
can
drank
this
beer
on
tap
in
munich
hands
down
the
best
lager
ive
ever
had
its
so
smooth
and
drinkable
with
just
enough
malt
presence
to
make
it
sweet
but
not
overly
so
the
carbonation
is
reserved
which
works
perfectly
for
this
beer
i
wish
they
could
export
a
fresh
keg
to
my
local

i

it
in
münich
and
tastes
as
good
at

too
overall
a
very
refreshing

lager
wouldnt
want
to
drink
too
many
of
them
but
still
very
recommendable
the
on

version
of
augustiner
hell
is
about
as
close
to
perfection
as
you
find
in
a
classic
munich
larger
the
medium
carbonation
and
smoothness
of
the
malt
make
it
very
drinkable
the
lack
of

makes
it
perfect

what
it

but
possibly
even
hopped
up
a

more
than
the

light

very

definitely
the
best
munich
helles
probably
why
almost
everyone
i
saw
drinking
a
beer
while
walking
around
munich
had
one
of
these
in
their
hand
nice

the
taste
is
quite
clean
with
a
hint
of
weakness
and
a
touch
of
seashells
as
well
overall
this
is
probably
one
of
the
best
tasting
pilsener
like
beers
i
have
ever
had
really
just
the
munich
helles
lager
just
about
the
perfect
example
of
the
style
try
it
from
the
gravity
casks
in
their
biergarten
in
the
summer
for
the
full
experience
remarks
did
not
score
a
t
s
m
at
that
time
so
please
disregard
those
scores
i
enjoyed
a
litre
of
this
lager
beer
in
munich
during
oktoberfest
this
beer
was
was
the
most
memorable
for
my
visit
this
larger
smelled
of
good
quality
hops
but
not
to
strong
of
a
hop
smell
the
color
and
head
were
perfect
the
body
was
medium
to
light
with
a
good
lager
flavor
there
is
also
a
very
slight
floral
sweet
aspect
to
this
lager
that
makes
it
unique
and
superb
bright
yellow
with
string
of
lace
which
whip
around
the
mug
as
the
level
of
the
beer
drops
the
aroma
of
cut
grass
hay
and
lemon
which
are
balanced
between
each
other
adds
additional
appeal
then
i
was
caught
by
surprise
how
well
this
tasted
i
like
myself
fresh
helles
but
theres
something
about
how
this
tasted
which
almost
made
me
dance
its
delicate
but
at
the
same
time
is
full
of
flavor
wave
after
wave
of
grass
citrus
dough
and
a
light
bitterness
explode
at
the
scene
its
light
bodied
with
appealing
crispness
which
helps
make
this
beer
not
only
very
drinkable
but
also
one
of
the
best
lagers
that
i
had
on
my
trip
from
munich
a
very
very
great
beer
my
favorite
german
beer
i
drank
a
ton
of
these
in
munich
and
brought
some
back
with
me
i
would
love
to
be
able
to
find
this
in
america
the
taste
like
many
of
the
other
munich
beers
is
very
smooth
not
heavy
but
with
a
rich
consistent
flavor
this
is
not
a
beer
with
a
very
unique
flavor
it
doesnt
have
fruit
or
random
stuff
in
it
it
is
simply
a
great
beer
a
beer
i
could
drink
every
single
day
smuggled
this
bottle
back
from
europe
had
a
buddy
traveling
through
munich
grab
this
and
meet
me
in
paris
claimed
it
was
his
favorite
german
beer
surely
upon
first
taste
it
was
delicious
it
poured
golden
with
large
amount
of
thin
lacing
that
dissipated
quickly
slight
hop
smell
but
standard
beer
smell
otherwise
seems
like
a
german
form
of
a
domestic
lager
hell
beer
so
light
in
color
great
session
beer
when
i
arrived
back
in
the
states
i
found
augustiner
in
bottles
and
was
hoping
that
my
appreciation
for
the
beer
would
be
the
same
i
was
not
disappointed
i
have
to
give
this
beer
full
points
because
its
simply
my
favorite
one
this
beer
is
a
flawless
example
of
helles
and
is
the
most
impressive
helles
i
have
ever
tasted
a
true
bench
mark
example
of
the
style
and
a

should

remarkable
and
my
very
favorite
of
the
style
otalking
about
augustineri
think
that
brau
edelstoff
have
more
reasons
to
be
called
best
helle
lager
they
do
their
own
malting
and
are
the
only
brewery
to
tap
from
wooden
kegs
at
their
beergardens
and
at
oktoberfest
absolutely
one
of
the
best
beers
ive
evr
had
in
fact
probably
the
best
beer
ever
i
enjoyed
a
slew
of
them
in
munich
and
wish
i
could
enjoy
them
on
tap
here
in
the
us
it
is
crisp
clean
refreshing
and
everything
else
youd
want
in
a
beer
so
freakin
good
this
is
an
exceptional
drink
i
wish
americans
could
appreciate
such
quality
and
produce
such
drink
here
in
the

i
didnt
even
have
to
put

a

that
i
would
definitely
have
again
nothing
quite
like
drinking
this
out
of
a
cask
in
munich
unfortunately
all
of
the
bottled
versions
of
this
are
lacking
however
it
is
still
one
of
most
amazing
beers
i
have
ever
had
if
you
like
german
beer
and
you
dont
like
the
cheap
ones
give
this
one
a
try
and
try
some
more
this
beer
is
downright
amazing
i
would
never
pass
up
this
beer
if
given

a

not

excellent

above

definitely
one
worth
trying
especially
for
fans
of

i
have
drunk
a
few
beers
in
a
few
countries
and
most
i
can
put
down
but
not
this
bad
boy
i
keep
a
rack
of
this
at
the
house
all
the
time
so
bewildering
in
fact
that
i
could
have
sworn
i
heard
just
a
trace
of
a
mocking
croaking
voice
whisper
good
good
now
go
extreme
my
young
apprentice
o
maybe
a
tad
too
sweet
for
me
but
all
in
all
a
classic
highly
drinkable
hell
great
at
what
it
is
supposed
to
be
a
delicate
refreshing
beer
superbly
balanced
and
very
drinkable
at
the
same
time
a
few
off
notes
in
there
too
a
better
than
average
helles
palate
palate
is
thin
a
bit
oily
and
a
light

finishing
is
sweet
and
longlasting
overall
augustiner
helles
is
widely
considered
a
superior
hellesbier
and
for
good
reason
its
uncomplicated
honest
and
easy
to
knock
back
where
munich
contemporaries
add
hops
extract
augustiner
brews
traditionally
by
using
the
finest
ingredients
d
easy
and
light
beer
very
drinkable
smell
is
of
grain
and
fruit
subtle
and
very
pleasing
aroma
taste
is
smooth
yet
rich
crisp
yet
substantial
both
smooth
grain
apple
taste
in
the
malts
and
a
sweet
hoppy
finish
like
a
czech
pilsner
while
the
bottled
version
isnt
quite
what
ive
had
fresh
on
tap
as
i
recall
this
is
still
a
superb
lager
a
benchmark
for
the
style
having
all
the
smoothness
and
subtleness
it
should
but
with
more
depth
and
complexity
of
flavor
than
its
european
peers
drinkability
a
good
beer
in
the
style
munich
helles
lager
pours
a
modest
yellow
straw
color
with
a
white
head
a
good
pours
doesnt
yield
a
large
head
though
theres
a
good
amount
of
lacing
the
nose
is
slightly
sweet
and
brings
a
really
nice
pale
grain
scent
the
taste
is
fairly
plain
and
difficult
to
describe
but
is
quite
quite
good
light
straw
and
grain
with
a
touch
of
sweetness
the
feel
is
excellent
with
a
nice
amount
of
carbonation
and
is
incredibly
soon
uber
sessionable
this
is
one
fine
beer
d
well
this
changes
my
mind
that
a
lager
has
to
be
an
amber
lager
before
it
is
sweet
a
damn
nice
and
smooth
helles
better
than
most
with
less
abv
bravo
beer
is
light
in
body
and
bright
on
the
palate
carbonation
is
high
on
the
palate
the
back
flavors
fall
away
quickly
leaving
a
nice
finish
with
no
aftertaste
beer
is
moderately
dry
but
its
not
bone
dry
leaving
a
nice
feeling
in
my
mouth
the
graininess
gives
the
beer
a
nice
flavor
and
overall
its
a
really
nice
drinking
beer
probably
the
best
helles
ive
ever
had
this
beer
drinks
exceptionally
well
i
dont
know
why
it
just
does
it
really
engages
the
palate
providing
a
lot
of
flavor
for
a
lighter
beer
awesome
lager
my
sister
got
to
sample
this
in
person
when
she
recently
traveled
to
germany
and
then
purchased
this
sixer
for
me
when
she
returned
to
the
u
s
because
she
enjoyed
it
so
much
and
new
i
was
a
fan
of
this
type
i
can
only
imagine
how
much
fresher
her
experience
was
but
this
certaintly
cant
be
too
far
off
the
mark
id
get
this
one
again
in
a
heartbeat
when
he
brought
the
first
glass
the
first
thing
i
noticed
was
the
2
finger
thick
head
and
it
stayed
that
way
for
some
time
before
i
took
the
first
swig
i
got
a
good
long
inhale
glorious
taste
cant
be
desribed
any
further
than
delectable
the
only
thing
that
kinda
bugged
me
was
the
stingy
after
taste
i
took
of
in
the
mouthfeel
category
other
than
that
i
think
this
is
a
finely
brewed
beverage
drinkability
i
could
drink
10
of
these
bottles
in
a
sitting
really
the
best
beer
for
every
season
to
me
not
super
light
and
not
super
heavy
i
would
love
this
with
some
roasted
chicken
or
fish
dishes
if
you
have
a
chance
to
try
this
version
its
going
to
be
a
revelation
the
american
import
version
is
good
but
this
is
a
whole
new
level
a
must
try
if
you
are
in
germany
dmaybe
one
of
my
favorites
of
all
time
just
superb
i
wish
i
could
get
this
on
tap
at
my
local
bar
i
hope
to
drink
this
beer
again
d
goes
down
so
smooth
you
can
drink
this
all
night
no
problem
which
i
have
done
on
several
occasions
the
sun
makes
the
beers
shine
but
all
that
glisens
isnt
gold
this
is
an
ok
lager
but
a
long
way
from
something
id
recommend
anyone
having
while
tasting
german
beers
overall
i
would
not
order
this
again
d
this
beer
has
a
very
soft
smooth
light
flavor
but
the
sulfur
is
mild
and
blends
well
with
the
slight
sweetness
the
hops
are
not
all
pungent
but
still
pretty
light
and
dry
it
is
a
refreshing
crisp
beer
just
a
little
drab
d
one
of
my
favorites
but
hard
to
get
here
in
vienna
but
it
is
worth
bothering
to
find
it
notes
good
simple
easy
to
drink
lager
just
a
nice
to
drink
everyday
session
beer
maybe
not
the
most
memorable
but
i
would
gladly
get
it
again
this
brew
manages
to
to
be
lightly
tart
and
biting
and
slightly
creamy
and
malty
in
the
same
sip
this
is
the
top
helles
in
the
land
of
helles
that
is
bavaria
it
deserves
the
high
accolades
and
really
is
stellar
for
the
style
cheers
i
have
requested
this
beer
in
heaven
and
for
a
desert
island
situation
as
some
of
the
reviewers
also
say
below
i
had
the
pleasure
of
drinking
a
lot
of
augustiner
at
the
2009
oktoberfest
i
loved
the
oktoberfest
bier
served
in
the
tent
and
also
the
lager
served
at
their
restaurant
near
marienplatz
so
when
i
saw
bottles
of
this
on
the
menu
at
post
390
restaurant
in
boston
i
thought
id
give
it
a
shot
well
as
they
say
its
always
freshest
at
the
source
poured
into
a
pint
glass
it
had
a
nice
bright
yellow
color
but
lacked
the
head
i
was
hoping
for
smell
was
clean
and
fresh
taste
kinda
let
me
down
somewhat
while
i
could
feel
that
crisp
german
lager
flavor
was
there
i
think
the
bottle
was
starting
to
turn
a
bit
as
it
was
a
bit
skunky
kinda
turned
me
off
a
bit
an
easy
beer
to
drink
but
maybe
i
should
have
skipped
it
in
the
us
and
just
kept
the
good
memories
of
drinking
it
at
oktoberfest
in
my
mind
if
you
find
yourself
in
oktoberfest
be
sure
to
stop
by
the
augustiner
tent
for
an
evening
with
this
excellent
helles
d
i
could
down
these
all
night
so
easy
to
drink
and
unoffensive
i
wish
i
could
have
a
liter
mug
of
this
in
munich
this
would
be
a
good
one
to
quaff
no
wonder
this
is
munichs
favourite
beer
id
love
to
go
over
there
now
just
to
try
some
on
tap
overall
dont
be
put
off
by
the
fact
that
all
the
bums
drink
this
around
the
train
station
this
is
one
of
the
most
drinkable
and
enjoyable
lagers
of
all
time
and
was
my
beer
of
choice
while
in
munich
its
just
as
good
out
of
the
bottle
as
well
this
one
rivals
and
probably
beats
weihenstephans
original
for
top
spot
in
the
helles
category
one
ill
definitely
make
a
staple
especially
in
the
warmer
summer
months
should
be
drunk
in
mass
quantities
munich
bums
have
good
taste
very
recommended
order
one
of
the
gigantic
pretzels
with
it
and
you
will
not
be
disappointed
although
all
their
food
is
excellent
world
class
for
sure
keep
this
in
the
fridge
and
pop
it
open
on
a
summer
day
and
a
great
accompanyment
to
the
soccer
or
whatever
preferred
sporting
event
fantastic
summer
beer
great
white
head
atop
a
brilliant
straw
head
head
is
lingering
and
leaves
some
very
tight
lacing
very
mild
hop
notes
with
a
decent
malt
aroma
taste
is
very
mildly
fruity
and
crisp
and
clean
tasty
and
light
without
being
watered
down
great
mouthfeel
and
overall
drinkability
amazingly
bright
and
golden
in
colour
with
a
thick
pillowy
head
sitting
firmly
atop
this
bier
great
lacing
fantastic
haylike
grainy
aroma
with
hints
of
hops
just
for
balance
unsurpassingly
smooth
with
a
moderate
carbonation
grassy
flavours
with
lots
of
character
from
the
malt
hands
down
the
best
helles
lager
i
had
while
in
bavaria
balanced
worked
and
played
well
with
everything
fantastic
in
its
sturdiness
and
underrated
simplistic
beauty
you
can
litterally
taste
how
fresh
this
beer
really
is
the
hops
are
grown
in
the
hallertau
valley
so
there
is
little
distance
from
the
actual
growspot
and
the
place
of
production
fresh
delicious
and
classic
i
had
this
beer
ontap
at
the
augustiner
bierhaus
in
munich
and
found
it
to
be
very
good
augustiner
is
by
far
the
best
brewery
in
munich
and
it
is
much
easier
to
recognize
because
of
the
competition
between
wheat
beers
in
the
area
it
has
a
golden
body
and
doesnt
give
off
much
smell
like
most
lagers
full
body
with
very
little
aftertaste
this
beer
is
widelyrespected
by
most
bavarians
in
the
desirable
sense
of
the
word
this
is
a
simple
beer
that
is
very
tasteful
this
is
a
light
bodied
brew
with
much
thirst
quenching
qualities
this
isnt
overly
carbonated
and
hits
the
spot
just
right
this
is
probably
about
the
most
unique
helles
lager
that
comes
out
of
münchen
even
though
i
am
a
big
fan
of
löwenbräu
overall
a
good
clean
and
very
drinkable
lager
nothing
groundbreaking
but
very
quaffable
worth
a
try
d
yes
like
most
german
beers
drinkabilitz
very
drinkable
and
from
what
i
hear
an
excellent
value
i
have
seen
this
being
drunk
all
over
munich
overall
for
me
this
is
a
world
class
example
of
helles
and
more
to
the
point
this
is
what
lager
should
taste
like
the
grüner
mönch
pours
nicely
into
a
picture
perfect
white
soft
pillowlike
head
reminiscent
of
the
sky
over
bavaria
it
really
is
a
thing
of
beauty
the
aroma
has
been
something
of
a
dilemma
for
me
upfront
and
unmistakable
is
the
sulfur
smell
produce
by
augustiner
closely
guarded
yeast
strain
the
characteristics
of
this
yeast
stain
are
so
specific
that
it
should
become
easily
recognizable
to
anyone
after
a
few
evenings
with
the
beer
the
sulfur
aroma
sometimes
borders
and
even
crosses
the
line
of
burnt
rubber
once
you
dive
in
past
this
upfront
and
sometimes
overly
strong
aroma
youll
find
a
lovely
soft
malt
aroma
that
lingers
with
a
mild
herblike
hop
aroma
hints
of
butter
are
to
be
found
sometimes
the
dilemma
for
me
was
rather
i
could
get
past
the
aroma
or
not
in
blind
tests
when
i
first
moved
here
i
killed
this
beer
on
aroma
i
didnt
like
apas
the
first
time
i
drank
one
either
many
years
ago
i
have
gotten
use
to
the
aroma
and
actually
appreciate
it
for
its
uniqueness
my
favorite
part
of
this
beer
is
definitely
the
flavormouth
feel
combination
the
mouth
feel
is
as
full
as
helles
gets
in
bayern
prickelndhigh
carbonation
on
the
tongue
and
coats
its
perfectly
before
departing
and
leaving
only
a
refreshed
feeling
nice
palate
cleanser
for
a
meal
pairing
the
flavor
is
definitely
influenced
by
their
yeast
strain
with
its
unique
characteristics
what
begins
with
a
slight
bitterness
up
front
quickly
falls
into
what
can
only
be
described
as
a
soft
malt
heaven
the
hop
bitterness
stays
with
you
from
the
beginning
to
the
swallow
and
then
lingers
nicely
on
the
tongue
soft
malt
sweetness
helps
to
balance
the
hop
flavor
is
somewhat
subdued
and
plays
a
back
ground
role
to
the
obviously
superior
brewing
process
that
turns
malt
into
elixir
i
have
found
this
beer
to
be
an
absolute
love
it
or
hate
it
beer
in
munich
understandable
when
you
look
at
it
from
the
standpoint
that
it
is
its
own
beer
the
other
guys
in
town
would
challenge
the
best
of
us
beer
lovers
to
separate
them
in
a
blind
test
what
can
i
say
some
like
it
average
and
some
not
i
had
this
beer
in
the
us
and
paid
13
for
a
sixer
guess
what
it
sucked
and
i
hated
it
but
now
i
have
had
it
fresh
and
im
happy
i
had
the
chance
to
get
to
know
this
bier
i
can
only
say
as
a
word
of
caution
for
everyone
who
drinks
imports
at
best
they
will
be
almost
as
good
as
drinking
it
here
and
at
worsewell
im
sure
you
all
have
you
own
horror
stories
about
money
time
and
opinions
being
wastedzum
wohl
its
appearance
is
pale
yellow
and
sparkling
with
white
head
the
beer
was
rather
foamy
it
was
lightly
hoppy
in
aroma
saaz
and
its
flavor
was
lightly
sweet
and
bready
well
balanced
with
european
tasting
hops
mouthfeel
was
fine
and
smooth
i
thought
this
beer
was
very
drinkable
reminds
me
of
the
besttasting
bitburger
or
warsteiner
ive
ever
had
d
pleasant
delicate
and
very
drinkable
solid
offering
poured
a
solid
white
froathy
head
over
a
clear
deepgolden
colored
beer
aroma
of
spicy
hops
from
the
pour
but
from
the
glass
there
is
a
pungent
stinky
cheese
smell
an
irregular
ring
of
lace
hangs
from
where
the
head
once
stood
crisp
flavor
a
lightly
soursweet
malt
flavor
at
first
that
becomes
less
sweet
and
more
bready
towards
the
end
the
finish
has
a
nice
spicy
hop
flavor
and
a
decent
bite
pretty
nice
its
like
a
step
up
on
malt
from
a
pilsner
i
could
drink
a
few
of
these
drinkability
medium
carbonation
is
easy
on
the
stomach
so
its
easy
to
have
a
few
could
drink
a
few
but
i
do
prefer
the
edelstoff
the
maltiness
is
very
crisp
a
good
quaff
overall
though
this
is
great
easydrinking
beer
its
a
prefect
way
to
start
your
day
a
liter
of
helles
at
the
augustiner
keller
just
down
the
road
from
the
munich
train
station
on
a
beautiful
sunny
summer
morning
this
is
heaven
this
is
manna
the
real
munich
beer
opinion
i
really
like
this
beer
but
this
was
a
bad
example
i
will
have
to
get
a
sixpack
just
for
a
review
and
get
it
from
a
high
volume
shop
so
i
know
it
will
be
fresh
i
will
post
another
review
when
i
feel
i
have
a
better
example
final
thought
this
beer
defines
munich
it
is
of
the
smoothest
and
most
drinkable
beers
in
the
world
and
not
overly
with
the
taste
this
beer
is
absolutely
remarkable
pours
a
clear
golden
color
with
a
white
head
that
dissipates
quickly
smells
of
spicy
hops
crisp
spicy
hop
flavor
with
enough
malt
precence
to
balance
everything
out
the
mouthfeel
is
light
and
dry
overall
this
would
make
for
a
good
brew
on
a
hot
summer
day
it
is
light
and
refreshing
but
still
has
a
lot
of
flavor
and
personality
taste
is
as
a
munich
hell
should
taste
if
i
may
say
it
or
you
ask
munich
people
im
oly
50
bavarian
love
this
brew
thats
malty
fresh
fully
yeast
flavoured
and
has
a
nice
but
quiet
bitter
aftertaste
the
color
was
of
a
transparent
vibrant
and
deep
gold
carbonation
was
very
light
and
could
be
easily
seen
head
was
light
bright
white
and
offered
a
bouquet
of
floral
herby
and
lightly
bitter
scents
taste
was
more
herby
and
of
earthy
flavors
than
hofbrau
helles
taste
was
more
pronounced
and
in
your
face
mouthfeel
was
smooth
and
relaxing

a

this
beer
was
perfect
for
a
hot
day
in
munich
crisp
dry
and
quenching
i
has
a
great
hop
bitterness
that
was
accompanied
by
a
subtle
maltiness
the
hop
bitterness
definitely
dominates
the
flavor
of
this
one
but
it
also
has
the
malt
backbone
to
balance
a
very
good
example
of
a
helles
far
better
than
most

a
golden

blended
with
some

grain
husk
notes
some
spicy

round
out
the
taste
and
leave
a
dry
finish
a
very
nice
choice
for
a
session
beer
clear

by

that
holds
ok

drops
to
a
standard

and
whispy
surface
foam
great
munich
malt
aroma
and
delicate
hop
background
the
body
is
medium
with
a
very
fine
and
moderate
carbonation
that
leaves
it
creamy
in
the
mouth
the
flavor
is
of
rich
munich
malts
supported
by
spicy
hops
long
malty
finish
this
is
a
very
straightforward
beer
with
a
great
munich
malt
character
quite
an
exceptional
beer
not
complex
but
with
a
great
depth
of
character
sweet
but
also
very
wellbalanced
and
exceptionally
drinkable
absolutely
worth
seeking
out
sidenote
bit
of
a
clinical

in
the

perhaps
i
saltwashed

hotrinsed

it

still
there

be

haylike
color
with
very
thick
foamy

a
wheatlike
sweetness
with
a
slight

delicate
without
being
complex
flavourful
without
being
complicated
clean
and
crisp
with
an
unsurpassing

not
much
to

but
a
fine

lager
in

light

and
highly
recommend
this

this
is

instead
makes
you

contemplate
it
what
youll
find
is
a
simple

pure
complex
beer
overall
i
am
typically
not
a

fan
however
this
beer
is
excellent
easy

with
a
wonderful

between

my
mark
out
of

would

i
can
imagine
myself
drink
gallons
of
this

of
art

lager
o
refreshing
light
beer
with
a
great
heritage
overall
pretty
solid
helles
lager
solid
beer
this
is
a
perfect
example
of
a
german
lager
a
benchmark
for
others
really
good
o
a
good
export
a
solid
pale
lager
with
a
little
bit
of
an
unexpected
kick
not
as
drinkable
as
hps
muenchener
gold
but
certainly
holds
it
own
i
have
heard
i
think
others
echo
this
here
that
it
incomparably
better
vom
fass
from
the
tap
i
will
review
further
if
i
find
results
change
once
i
get
the
chance
additional
note
i
tasted
this
side
by
side
with
the
standard
hell
and
didnt
find
much
difference
its
just
slightly
darker
and
also
a
touch
fuller
in
character
but
not
by
much
and
at
the
same
time
a
little
less
malty
more
balanced
shall
we
say
so
id
guess
its
got
a
degree
or
so
more
plato
to
it
a
touch
more
hops
for
flavor
and
just
a
hint
of
additional
bitterness
to
balance
that
as
well
or
is
it
the
same
beer
and
just
slightly
more
fermented
no
probably
not
there
is
a
massive
difference
between
tasting
this
beer
from
a
wooden
keg
2
places
in
munich
always
offer
this
the
augustiner
keller
biergarten
and
the
augustiner
braeustuben
the
wooden
keg
edelstoff
is
indescribably
outstanding
the
bottle
version
is
blah
and
thats
putting
it
mildly
make
the
trip
try
it
from
the
wooden
keg
as
it
was
meant
to
be
enjoyed
at
the
above
mentioned
locals
and
your
taste
buds
will
thank
you
for
it
trust
me

and
a

flavor
is
crisp

pale

and
some
grapey
fruit
not
too
much
going
on
a
little
sweet
for
what
i
like
in
a
helles
pretty
light
bodied
and
easy
to
drink
i
wish
there
was
more
depth
to
the
maltiness
and
just
a
little
more
hop
presence
but
pretty
good
id
love
to
try
it
in
germany
some
day
but
i
dont
see
myself
buying
this
again
in
the
states
as
its
way
too
damn
expensive
honestly
until
i
came
to
munich
and
had
this
beer
i
was
skeptical
of
the
german
lager
im
an
american
and
i
love
my
overly
hoppy
ipas
but
after
a
few
days
in
munich
drinking
this
beer
i
realized
that
not
all
beer
can
be
or
should
be
filled
to
the
top
with
hops
i
have
gotten
a
little
annoyed
with
what
i
call
hop
race
in
america
where
all
these
beers
are
competing
to
be
the
happiest
im
speaking
generally
anyways
i
said
all
that
to
say
that
this
beer
is
the
perfect
example
of
a
german
lager
and
is
almost
perfect
in
every
way
its
refreshing
and
i
could
drink
it
buy
the
liters
i
tried
the
other
big
six
breweries
of
munich
while
there
and
this
was
my
favorite
i
love
how
its
still
independently
owned
and
doesnt
have
to
market
itself
everyone
drinks
this
around
munich
but
you
wont
find
any
advertisements
sells
itself
overall
decent
brew
i
would
call
this
breed
standard
have
one
by
all
means
as
far
as
munich
helles
goes
this
is
a
very
good
example
as
far
as
im
concerned
i
really
enjoy
this
beer
a
lot
i
remember
enjoying
it
a
lot
more
at
the
bräustuben
but
its
really
an
issue
of
atmosphere
and
having
some
pork
knuckle
to
eat
with
it
highly
recommend
o
a
tasty
brew
my
first
helles
lager
but
it
seems
like
the
perfect
pilsenerstyle
beer
although
a
bit
sweeter
perhaps
with
more
substance
highly
sessionable
and
very
much
appreciated
in
the
current
summer
heat
did
not
score
a
t
s
m
at
that
time
disregard
those
scores
overall
this
now
is
my
1
top
rated
warmerweather
light
beer
cheers
prosit
i
thought
the
augustiner
lagerbier
hell
yesterday
was
an
amazing
lager
until
i
tried
this
one
and
it
blew
me
away
much
more
sweet
and
bready
in
flavor
than
the
original
lagerbier
helles
im
very
surprised
this
one
has
a
lower
rating
i
could
drink
this
one
all
day
hands
down
the
best
lager
ive
ever
had
an
original
recipe
since
1328
enjoyed
this
bier
again
delicious
this
is
what
beer
should
taste
like
pours
a
clear
yellow
with
a
foamy
white
head
that
settles
to
a
partial
film
on
top
of
the
beer
small
dots
of
lace
slowly
drip
into
the
remaining
beer
on
the
drink
down
there
is
initially
a
strong
skunk
aroma
after
the
pour
that
dissipates
somewhat
over
time
i
am
also
getting
some
malt
grain
and
grassy
and
herbal
aromas
taste
is
much
the
same
with
sweet
grain
flavors
on
the
finish
there
is
a
mild
amount
of
hop
bitterness
on
the
palate
with
each
sip
this
beer
has
a
lower
level
of
carbonation
with
a
slightly
crisp
mouthfeel
overall
this
is
a
pretty
good
beer
but
the
flavors
are
a
bit
too
sweet
in
my
opinion
this
beer
is
regarded
among
many
bavarians
as
the
greatest
beer
in
the
world
i
for
one
cannot
disagree
it
tastes
exactly
as
helles
should
with
no
exaggerated
colors
aromas
flavors
etc
i
admit
that
im
biased
toward
german
lagers
as
my
style
of
choice
this
one
to
me
stands
out
as
simple
perfection
rjt
prost
o
this
was
a
nice
german
beer
while
im
not
a
huge
fan
of
the
style
i
definitely
enjoyed
drinking
this
although
i
cant
say
that
it
couldnt
have
been
proven
upon
i
liked
this
and
i
would
drink
it
again
as
well
as
recommend
it
if
you
want
a
true
german
beer
experience
o
my
go
to
bavarian
lager
unfortunately
they
do
not
export
the
5
liter
bottles
i
recommend
this
beer
and
if
it
werent
so
expensive
here
id
buy
it
more
often
overall
decent
but
not
great
in
my
opinion
not
sure
how
long
this
six
pack
had
been
sitting
on
the
shelf
but
i
am
glad
i
picked
it
up
anyway
very
pale
clear
medium
head
which
wasnt
particulary
well
retained
but
some
lacing
hung
around
malty
aroma
a
bit
in
your
face
notes
of
tangerie
tasted
munich
malts
had
a
balanced
sweetness
finish
slightly
bittersweet
flavours
were
a
bit
coarse
well
carbonated
quite
crisp
smooth
enough
slightly
thicker
texture
than
augustiners
helles
overall
not
bad
at
all
rated
lower
than
the
helles
by
the
munich
natives
which
was
more
subtle
why
anyone
would
drink
any
of
the
bmc
macro
swill
when
this
is
available
is
a
complete
mystery
to
me
very
nice
beer
such
a
clean
beer
and
it
feels
so
smooth
this
is
a
lesson
in
how
smooth
and
clean
a
good
german
beer
should
be
now
if
it
just
had
a
touch
more
sweetness
itd
be
world
class
ogermans
knows
business
o
a
good
choice
i
could
keep
drinking
this
refreshing
treat
all
summer
long
o
just
superb
taste
is
clean
and
bready
with
a
little
sweetness
balanced
by
a
hint
of
citrus
hops
overall
an
enjoyable
wellconstructed
and
drinkable
german
lager
overall
this
is
a
decent
helles
lager
but
there
are
some
faults
with
the
aroma
this
is
a
nice
soft
wellrounded
german
lager
its
aroma
is
malty
light
and
fresh
the
golden
colored
beer
is
slightly
hazy
but
capped
with
a
bright
head
the
taste
is
clean
with
a
notable
pale
malt
flavor
fuller
in
body
than
expected
and
very
drinkable
an
nice
german
beer
of
course
augustiner
bräu
wants
to
sell
you
bottled
beer
but
augustiner
edelstoff
is
designed
to
be
drunk
fresh
on
tap
in
munich
or
nearby
a
bottle
of
the
stuff
in
america
is
a
very
different
experience
that
difference
includes
more
hoppy
than
you
will
get
from
a
crisp
fresh
helles
o
a
very
tasty
helles
lager
superb
drinkability
very
refreshing
and
thirst
quenching
httpabarwithnoname

com
theres
a
friendly
dryness
to
this
brew
with
the
tartness
of
fruit
i
can
imagine
lemon
pepper
chicken
and
rice
accompanying
this
one
with
style
and
finesse
overall
a
complex
yet
refreshing
beer
that
i
could
definitely
have
multiple
of
in
a
given
sitting
a
great
session
beer
and
the
wooden
cask
aging
just
puts
it
over
the
top
o
very
enjoyable
and
certainly
one
to
grab
again
the
next
time
im
by
a
store
that
carries
it
very
easy
to
drink
but
with
a
real
pleasant
maltiness
to
it
definitely
sessionable
i
was
given
a

i
was
surprised
by
the
clean
fresh
aroma
of
this
beer
i
guess
ive
become
used
to
german
lagers
having
that
diacetyl
skunkiness
hence
my
surprise
when
i
tasted
the
actual
bright
of
this
helles
lager
great
balance
allaround
very
enjoyable
wondering
if
the
secret
is
the
brown

here

a

taste
noted
some
of
the
grassy
tones
mentioned
in
previous
reviews
not
sure
if
i
would
rate
it
as
high
as
some
of
the
previous
marks
but
a
good
fairly
light
weight
pilsener
d
pretty
good
i
was
surprised
this
isnt
a
style
ive
been
impressed
with
before
pours
a
straw
yellow
nice
white
head
leaves
quickly
smell
is
very
grassy
slight
skunkiness
taste
is
full
of
cereal
and
sweet
grains
very
subtle
and
subdued
tasted
like
a
german
lager
should
had
a
very
crisp
feeling
on
the
tongue
not
greatnot
bad
i
rated
this
against
other
helles
lagers
and
find
it
to
be
an
exceptional
version
very
complex
for
such
a
light
lager
others
should
take
note
the
flavor
is
crisp
with
malt
taste
and
slight
sweet
edge
w
mild
floral
hop
flavor
and
an
accent
of
pepper
with
light
bread
dough
w
yeast
adding
to
the
lightly
kilned
malt
flavor
adding
dry
spice
in
the
mostly
clean
and
dry
finish
overall
this
is
a
very
good
lager
i
could
enjoy
this
frequently
with
no
problem
a
pretty
great
beer
for
the
style
which
shows
flaws
easily
pours
crystal
clear
straw
gold
soapy
white
head
and
decent
lace
and
retention
aroma
of
bready
malts
noble
hops
and
clean
lager
yeast
in
the
taste
mildly
sweet
upfront
more
bread
flowery
noble
hop
bitterness
provides
a
delicate
balance
mouthfeel
is
medium
to
light
bodied
crisp
and
drying
solid
lager
nice
dry
hop
and
easy
to
drink
the
last
time
i
had
an
augustiner
was
in
germany
ontap
at
a
restaurant
even
though
this
one
is
in
a
bottle
it
is
very
good
though
expensive
it
lacks
the
something
special
that
most
helles
have
but
in
a
different
way
i
really
like
this
one
o
fantastic
goto
helles
lager
by
one
of
the
oldest
brewing
companies
in
the
world
love
this
one
if
youre
looking
for
a
helles
definitely
recommended
the
aroma
was
light
some
small
amount
of
smoked
in
it
with
lots
of
grain
and
bready
malts
though
i
have
to
admit
not
much
here
to
really
pick
up
on
the
flavor
was
a
bit
better
lots
of
campfire
like
smokiness
in
it
with
a
subtle
yet
easily
definable
bready
malt
base
some
sweetness
caramel
maybe
and
a
light
peach
flavor
when
cold
that
quickly
gets
burnt
out
by
the
smoked
and
roasted
malts
way
too
light
of
a
feel
almost
makes
the
flavor
get
lost
as
it
comes
across
a
bit
watered
down
o
not
the
best
helles
ive
had
but
certainly
drinkable
and
good
for
a
hot
day
lots
of
nice
flavors
going
on
and
decently
balanced
drinks
quite
well
in
a
very
hot
living
room
this
is
just
great
brew
all
the
elements
fit
an
easy
choice
to
have
again
overall
not
worth
it
for
the
price
but
its
is
pretty
good
still
like
spaten
better
very
aromatic
and
tasty
beer
that
is
a
perfect
example
of
the
beer
that
germany
produces
perfect
head
with
a
good
amount
of
residual
yeast
floating
about
to
contribute
to
that
delicious
yeasty
flavor
that
most
americans
would
consider
unpleasant
and
foreign
but
to
the
expert
it
is
a
godsent
dr
while
this
wouldnt
be
an
awful
fest
beer
it
ant
much
of
a
normal
beer
normal
abv
easy
drinking
and
low
quality
leave
it
on
the
shelf
lads
and
pick
something
better
notes
highly
drinkable
quality
product
lemon
is
a
nice
touch
this
beer
poured
out
has
a
pale
golden
color
the
head
was
a
little
fizzy
and
left
just
a
touch
of
lacing
the
smell
of
the
beer
has
the
traditional
german
aroma
there
a
light
skunk
and
grass
aromas
there
also
a
little
lemon
on
the
nose
the
taste
is
actually
a
little
citrusy
mixed
with
the
grassy
flavors
its
got
a
pretty
refreshing
mouthfeel
actually
and
its
got
a
lighter
body
overall
this
beer
was
much
better
than
i
expected
it
to
be
flavor
was
sort
of
bland
with
a
dry
papery
saltine
cracker
taste
some
grassy
hop
bitterness
in
the
aftertaste
but
fairly
subtle
feel
was
very
light
and
a
bit
watery
dry
with
little
to
no
residual
sweetness
left
with
a
somewhat
hollow
impression
it
was
ok
to
pair
with
some
food
but
ultimately
just
a
pedestrian
lager
that
didnt
hold
interest
for
long
poured
a
2
irregular
offwhite
head
which
dissipated
to
barely
a
trace
clear
straw
yellow
in
color
smells
of
malt
grass
and
has
just
a
slight
start
of
skunking
taste
could
be
any
average
bmc
american
beer
and
in
a
blind
taste
test
im
pretty
confident
i
would
have
guessed
it
was
one
of
those
acceptable
but
i
guess
i
expected
more
from
the
makers
of
maximator
this
is
a
very
solid
quenching
lager
everything
about
this
screams
quality
you
can
tell
its
wellmade
even
if
the
flavor
doesnt
smack
you
over
the
head
simple
but
elegant
id
drink
this
anytime
recommended
cheers
for
me
this
style
should
be
subtle
and
delicate
and
this
beer
nails
that
im
still
not
in
love
with
the
style
but
this
is
a
light
tasting
easy
drinking
beer
a
cut
above
most
macro
brews
overall
one
of
the
biggest
surprises
out
here
in
poland
that
i
ran
into
and
also
something
that
turned
to
be
quite
well
made
but
poorly
executed
pour
as
nice
and
golden
with
a
healthy
head
nose
was
sort
of
nothing
out
of
the
ordinary
i
was
expecting
some
sort
of
interesting
notes
of
german
yeast
and
grain
but
it
was
just
very
much
euro
pale
smelling
palate
was
surprisingly
smoother
though
or
at
least
it
maintained
that
for
a
long
period
of
time
the
feel
was
the
only
solid
thing
that
differentiated
the
beer
from
anything
that
was
quite
common
around
eastern
europe
a
bit
of
apple
and
straw
husk
the
bottle
looks
better
than
the
beer
actually
seems
to
taste
dainty
little
thing
watery
abv
is
really
suspect
carbonation
is
soft
lacking
probably
the
lightest
helles
ive
ever
had
not
crisp
enough
to
drink
in
quantity
too
light
to
bother
to
import
in
general
a
good
drinking
even
if
i
wasnt
in
the
right
conditions
for
taste
a
beer
so
i
promote
edelstoff
but
i
wanna
drink
it
another
soon
overall
nice
lighter
but
good
flavors
good
malt
and
mash
profile
fairly
tasty
and
very
drinkable
drinkability
this
is
where
this
lager
was
at
its
best
i
cant
imagine
how
good
this
would
be
on
tap
but
even
from
the
bottle
this
is
a
terrific
session
bier
overall
very
enjoyable
goes
great
with
a
german
meal
this
beer
is
really
similar
to
the
lagerbier
hell
almost
same
taste
and
aroma
but
it
has
much
more
to
say
in
my
opinion
it
has
the
great
drinkability
of
a
classic
german
lager
but
it
also
has
the
fullfilling
mouthfeel
that
is
peculiar
with
the
great
beers
a
very
fine
lager
potent
for
what
it
is
hugely
enjoyable
a
malt
forward
lager
next
to
lagerbier
from
the
same
brewery
this
is
less
hoppy
not
as
dry
lively
or
balanced
and
all
around
bigger
does
cloy
a
bit
though
d
the
beer
is
easy
to
drink
and
rather
sessionable
this
is
a
very
good
lager
usually
i
dont
like
exportbier
because
its
too
sweet
but
the
edelstoff
is
balanced
and
highly
drinkable
augustiner
makes
some
great
beer
thumbsup
it
would
be
easy
to
drink
a
few
of
these
by
themselves
or
with
some
good
german
cuisine
d
if
all
lagers
tasted
like
this
i
would
be
drinking
them
way
more
often
amazing
flavor
without
the
dreaded
skunky
green
bottle
aroma
associated
with
the
major
german
beers
great
body
and
very
clean
mouthfeel
for
a
lager
this
is
very
flavorful
highly
sessionable
just
sad
this
is
the
only
one
i
have
drinkability
a
very
refreshing
helles
not
the
best
ive
ever
had
but
still
pleasant
the
flavors
blend
really
well
not
overpowering
and
this
makes
for
a
good
session
drink
good
aroma
and
raw
ingredients
most
of
the
flavors
can
be
uniquely
distinguished
good
quality
and
a
fine
beer
bottle
may
be
good
but
nothing
beats
having
a
fresh
glass
poured
from
tap
at
the
augustiner
keller
right
around
the
corner
and
down
a
few
blocks
from
the
munich
hauptbahnhof
thirst
quenching
delicious
sweet
maltly
clean
aroma
no
carbonation
activity
in
my
glass
just
abstract
lacing
down
the
glass
like
staring
up
at
clouds
and
looking
for
hidden
meanings
like
drinking
cold
gold
for
sure
go
there
pours
a
golden
yellow
crystal
clear
color
with
a
small
1
finger
white
head
has
a
nice
amount
of
carbonation
stemming
from
the
base
of
the
glass
really
pretty
lacing
as
each
sip
goes
down
the
aroma
is
sweet
biscuity
malts
with
a
malt
freshness
coming
through
that
is
very
european
in
nature
has
a
crisp
flavor
profile
really
nice
lemony
bitterness
followed
by
sweet
malts
like
toast
with
butter
great
mouthfeel
overall
easy
as
hell
drinking
and
smooth
all
the
way
through
would
love
to
get
more
of
this
not
as
good
as
the
traditional
helles
by
a
little
bit
but
really
good
nonetheless
ive
read
that
this
beer
is
kind
of
hard
to
get
here
in
the
states
as
there
is
only
one
distributer
of
it
this
makes
me
all
the
happier
to
have
been
able
to
try
it
its
tasty
kind
of
reminicent
of
paulaner
with
more
flavor
recommended
medium
malty
body
with
crisp
carbonation
d
one
of
the
more
complex
imported
helles
ive
had
i
think
it
would
be
a
sight
to
seetaste
in
munich
proper
but
its
held
up
well
overpriced
though
imo
a
1820
a
6er
this
was
easy
to
drink
though
i
expected
more
flavor
i
thought
it
was
a
bit
thin
and
watery
and
there
could
have
been
more
flavor
d
a
great
representation
of
the
style
flavor
and
balance
along
with
a
great
feel
pretty
wure
i
could
drink
a
lot
very
drinkable
nice
to
drink
a
tasty
low
abv
beer
not
everything
needs
to
be
extreme
if
its
done
well
and
this
is
done
well
if
only
this
were
on
tap
over
here
all
summer
instead
of
american
macros
give
it
a
try
unfortunately
this
beer
pales
in
comparison
to
augustiners
lagerbier
hell
which
is
excellent
where
this
one
is
pretty
average
i
drank
two
bottles
trying
to
come
up
with
anything
that
would
distinguish
it
as
a
beer
and
i
got
nothing
id
rather
not
repeat
the
experience
poured
in
a
pils
glass
for
a
clear
golden
body
and
a
small
fizzy
head
dry
airy
pils
malt
with
some
graininess
and
leafy
bitter
hops
easy
to
drink
light
bodied
beer
that
has
a
little
sweetness
that
is
the
backdrop
of
a
strong
pils
malt
presence
along
some
dry
citric
hops
simple
but
refreshing
drinkability
very
easy
to
drink
should
get
this
instead
of
any
light
american
pilsner
pours
a
golden
hue
with
a
bright
white
head
leaves
23
fingers
worth
of
head
space
fine
even
lacing
very
nice
look
to
it
aroma
has
a
light
lemongrassherbal
hop
note
with
light
biscuit
malts
slight
metallic
edge
from
the
hard
water
flavor
is
great
a
fresh
easy
drinking
helles
lager
right
out
of
munich
light
biscuitcrackers
from
the
malts
herbal
lively
slghtly
citric
hops
in
the
background
refreshing
as
all
hell
very
clean
drinking
experience
this
is
an
art
form
mouthfeel
is
light
bodied
carbonation
is
sturdy
and
natural
never
heavy
on
the
palate
no
harshness
to
be
had
here
drinkability
is
grab
a
sixer
type
of
beer
at
least
a
six
great
for
the
summer
im
glad
fresh
edelstoff
showed
up
at
my
local
poured
a
silver
foiled
12oz
bottle
into
my
smokestack
goblet
i
have
to
say
i
love
the
cap
underneath
the
silver
foil
it
has
a
awesome
little
monk
with
a
beer
its
pretty
cool
definitely
will
go
into
my
collection
of
my
favorites
this
beer
pours
a
fizzy
straw
with
a
massive
3
inch
foamy
white
head
that
leaves
no
lacing
whatsoever
the
aroma
has
a
definite
green
bottle
funk
which
is
odd
because
its
in
a
brown
bottle
after
the
sulfur
comes
a
little
pilsner
malts
and
some
grassy
hops
the
flavor
is
exactly
the
same
it
really
is
a
clean
lager
no
huge
flavors
but
at
the
same
time
no
off
flavors
at
all
the
mouthfeel
is
light
and
crisp
finishing
rather
dryly
overall
its
a
good
lager
nothing
to
right
home
about
but
great
on
a
hot
day
overall
it
was
a
good
beer
but
it
didnt
stick
out
as
something
i
would
search
for
d
a
great
helles
that
is
both
refreshing
and
flavorful
definitely
worth
trying
if
you
are
in
to
german
lagers
d
this
beer
has
a
nice
smooth
beer
but
there
is
some
nice
depth
of
flavor
for
such
a
light
beer
and
it
has
a
nice
freshness
to
the
crisp
malt
flavor
the
drinkability
is
at
high
levels
d
goes
down
very
easy
taste
spritz
of
carbonation
of
front
then
mostly
flavorless
light
in
body
very
drinkable
but
not
particularly
memorable
clean
inoffensive
im
liking
this
more
as
we
go
however
edelstoff
doesnt
really
have
anything
to
set
apart
for
any
other
lager
d
this
is
a
very
good
helles
lager
many
thanks
to
the
better
half
for
bringing
this
along
with
a
few
other
german
brews
in
her
luggage
from
munich
despite
its
robust
somewhat
raw
graininess
this
manages
excellent
drinkability
taste
is
by
all
means
a
soft
and
neutral
malty
flavour
with
a
metallic
and
bitter
hoppy
ending
not
too
strong
either
the
virtues
of
european
delicate
blends
medium
bodied
surprisingly
although
refreshing
a
decent
beer
but
nothing
to
go
out
of
your
way
for
mouthfeel
is
light
refreshing
and
sparkling
the
subdued
sweetness
really
adds
to
the
drinkablity
of
this
brew
making
it
one
of
the
finer
ones
ive
tried
is
is
better
than
the
original
helles
no
but
this
is
the
export
and
yo
should
always
keep
the
best
for
yourself
d
a
very
chuggable
beer
especially
suitable
for
das
boot
if
youve
got
one
no
great
flavour
typical
of
the
style
it
is
refreshing
and
lightwieght
in
the
mouthfeel
it
does
however
have
an
after
kick
the
alcohol
comes
in
towards
the
end
and
leaves
a
pleasant
malty
for
a
helles
reminder
that
youve
had
a
beer
its
very
refreshing
very
light
smooth
and
sessionable
with
a
nicely
sharp
floral
hop
bite
and
some
nice
sweet
cracker
malts
a
little
bit
of
apple
ill
be
buying
it
again
served
from
a
12
oz
bottle
pours
with
a
nice
big
head
that
has
decent
retention
and
leaves
a
good
amount
of
lacing
very
nice
medium
golden
appearance
indicative
of
the
style
good
restrained
aroma
with
pleasant
malt
presence
mixing
with
tart
slightly
sour
notes
in
the
background
taste
is
very
smooth
and
moderately
subdued
malt
notes
again
mixing
with
an
unexpected
but
not
unwelcome
tartness
or
sourness
in
the
background
nice
smooth
mouthfeel
with
restrained
carbonation
extremely
drinkable
and
pleasant
overall
an
excellent
beer
and
a
great
representative
of
the
style
dry
and
lowcarbonated
beer
neutral
a
bit
numb
palate
distinguished
drinkability
is
unbelievable
drinkability
a
person
could
drink
many
liters
of
this
beer
on
a
summer
day
i
wish
i
discovered
this
beer
in
the
heat
of
july
d
this
one
is
very
drinkabel
i
have
never
had
it
out
of
the
bottle
but
out
of
the
barrel
it
is
fresh
and
goes
down
very
easy
my
favorite
beer
of
this
style
in
the
world
d
also
very
drinkable
and
easy
to
down
a
bit
filling
from
the
extra
malt
i
think
but
a
nice
beer
to
session
fresh
bottle
pours
clear
straw
yellow
with
a
fizzy
white
head
that
doesnt
hold
together
very
well
smell
is
lightly
sweet
and
grainy
with
some
faint
floral
notes
tastes
of
pils
malt
and
slightly
grassy
hops
very
slightly
spicy
and
fairly
sweet
overall
light
body
with
good
carbonation
not
a
bad
helles
just
not
much
character
really
got
this
in
a
bottle
from
the
karstadt
grocery
store
in
munich
the
aroma
is
nice
with
a
slightly
malthoney
accent
flavor
is
good
clean
balance
tilted
towards
malt
but
nice
overall
the
beer
is
an
easy
drinking
beer
as
the
style
dictates
although
i
think
that
tending
to
usually
drink
american
ales
with
their
variety
and
aggressive
flavors
may
have
my
taste
buds
a
bit
miscalibrated
it
has
a
grainy
and
distinctive
yeast
aroma
it
came
to
my
table
in
a
tumbler
looking
picture
perfect
there
is
a
nice
transparent
golden
color
to
this
beer
the
head
and
lace
are
both
well
formed
grass
and
fruity
hop
like
taste
the
body
has
a
bit
of
carbonation
burn
but
is
still
easy
to
drink
a
very
refreshing
beer
altogether
overall
another
great
helles
lager
bier
from
augustiner
in
all
fairness
i
assume
this
is
the
same
as
their
vollbier
but
with
a
little
more
pop
for
the
export
market
it
has
a
slightly
bolder
grainy
quality
and
a
touch
more
bitterness
in
the
aftertaste
but
the
similarities
are
obvious
the
look
wasnt
quite
up
to
the
standards
of
the
vollbier
but
this
was
a
topnotch
lager
from
a
topnotch
brewery
conclusion
tasty
nicely
fruity
but
nothing
special
and
imo
not
quite
worth
the
price
for
the
six
pack
the
drinkability
and
mouthfeel
of
this
beverage
are
amazing
it
is
crisp
and
very
refreshing
overall
well
balanced
and
an
enjoying
experience
that
easily
welcomes
another
pours
a
clear
pale
yellow
color
14
inch
head
of
a
white
color
good
retention
and
poor
lacing
smells
of
slight
hops
strong
yeast
cleanliness
pale
malt
and
some
sweet
malt
fits
the
style
of
a
munich
helles
lager
mouth
feel
is
smooth
and
crisp
with
a
high
carbonation
level
the
carbonation
is
too
high
in
my
opinion
tastes
of
strong
yeast
cleanliness
slight
pale
hop
and
strong
pale
male
overall
a
decent
lager
but
nothing
special
really
taste
is
a
little
maltier
than
expected
and
quite
a
bit
less
bitter
very
light
tastes
like
your
standard
run
of
the
mill
lager
but
much
smoother
and
with
very
few
offputting
flavors
at
all
very
drinkable
if
slightly
dull
not
nearly
as
quaffable
or
smooth
as
id
like
in
this
style
not
a
bad
beer
but
id
imagine
this
beer
being
a
delicate
style
is
10
times
better
at
the
source
d
bavarian
lagers
are
invariably
solid
and
this
is
no
exception
its
just
not
worth
paying
13
for
a
sixpack
why
is
this
not
classified
as
a
dortmunderexport
drinkability
session
session
session
i
wish
i
could
get
a
keg
of
this
beer
on
tap
this
is
the
ultimate
lager
style
beer
i
highly
recommend
if
you
get
your
hands
on
it
the
aroma
has
a
hay
like
grass
paper
latex
and
corn
malt
the
appearance
is
pale
gold
with
a
small
head
the
flavor
is
like
the
aroma
and
has
that
euro
lager
incense
taste
the
palate
is
thin
overall
not
something
i
would
buy
again
i
am
just
not
a
fan
of
this
despite
being
to
style
this
is
a
very
good
munich
helles
i
still
prefer
the
weihenstephaner
but
this
is
another
fine
option
woe
is
me
if
only
the
6pack
didnt
cost
a
dastardly
16
drinkability
overall
the
best
helles
i
have
tasted
and
i
would
love
to
have
more
of
this
beer
i
sure
cant
wait
to
go
back
to
munich
so
i
can
stockpile
the
stuff
if
you
couldnt
already
tell
its
highly
recommended
absolutely
simply
great
d
easily
drinkable
and
nicely
balanced
this
bottled
version
has
held
up
to
the
trip
across
the
atlantic
better
than
i
would
have
expected
but
i
know
from
personal
experience
that
it
is
better
still
on
draught
in
munich
d
this
is
a
light
easy
to
drink
flavorful
beer
not
exactly
in
line
with
the
typical
munich
helles
lager
but
very
easy
to
like
d
pretty
good
nothing
to
complain
about
but
not
so
appetizing
d
an
easytodrink
lager
that
doesnt
have
as
much
personality
as
it
could
and
as
it
needs
nothing
really
wrong
with
this
brew
but
it
could
have
a
bit
bigger
flavor
this
is
a
highly
quaffable
helles
lager
it
hits
all
the
bases
for
the
style
and
then
some
wish
this
was
available
in
canada
this
style
is
underrated
because
of
its
subtlety
deserves
higher
reviews
the
taste
is
a
firm
slightly
oily
bready
malt
with
lots
of
herb
juniper
lemon
its
lightly
sweet
with
a
light
lingering
bitter
finish
there
is
a
lot
going
on
here
all
harmoniously
and
its
overall
wonderful
taste
mouthfeel
crisp
and
dry
initially
malty
sweetness
reveals
itself
slowly
with
a
touch
of
floral
hop
flavor
to
back
it
up
the
finish
is
drying
again
and
only
faintly
bitter
simple
and
straightforward
stuff
but
clean
and
very
drinkable
id
love
to
try
this
on
tap
at
the
brewery
its
on
the
high
side
of
light
bodied
and
the
carbonation
is
on
the
light
side
the
drinkability
is
top
notch
great
brew
in
my
book
a
nice
sessionableeasydrinking
helles
with
a
good
balance
to
it
within
the
style
mouthfeel
and
drinkability
finish
on
this
one
is
dry
it
works
very
nicely
with
the
hop
flavorgrassyfloral
notes
and
bitterness
one
of
the
last
components
to
taste
leads
to
a
dry
finish
body
is
medium
and
carbonation
is
delicate
and
does
not
get
in
the
way
of
the
brews
flavor
this
is
one
beer
that
is
easy
to
drink
and
i
can
easily
be
putting
a
few
more
of
these
back
in
one
sitting
on
the
other
hand
im
not
sure
that
this
beer
is
worth
the
12
00
for
the
sixer
there
have
to
be
better
ones
out
there
that
are
cheaper
still
glad
i
got
to
try
it
a
decent
beer
that
is
worth
the
time
to
try
maybe
ill
come
back
to
it
and
maybe
i
wont
but
ill
definitely
be
looking
to
other
beers
of
the
same
style
a
great
helles
going
down
clean
and
quenchingly
but
begging
for
another
draught
the
quintessential
german
quaffing
brew
perfect
for
downing
in
the
company
of
friends
but
at
a
cost
of
2
99
a
bottle
not
quite
fitting
as
the
quintessential
american
session
beer
great
drinkability
a
damn
fine
helles
was
even
better
fresher
in
germany
if
memory
serves
me
recommended
this
beer
is
solely
worth
the
trip
to
muenchen
let
alone
any
other
beer
augustiner
will
never
let
anyone
down
overall
a
good
clean
and
very
drinkable
lager
nothing
groundbreaking
but
very
drinkable
worth
a
try
bottle
light
gold
color
with
a
full
wispy
head
that
lasts
well
aroma
shows
fresh
malt
butter
light
grain
husk
with
perhaps
a
touch
of
lemon
from
the
hops
smells
pretty
pure
and
clean
flavor
also
shows
purity
with
no
off
flavors
solid
hop
bitterness
and
really
nicely
balanced
its
a
nice
beer
its
ok
but
especially
at
the
price
by
far
the
most
expensive
german
beer
at
the
store
this
one
is
not
worth
it
maybe
on
tap
in
munich
but
not
in
riverside
d
easy
to
drink
but
i
probably
wont
get
it
again
very
easy
to
drink
a
true
session
beer
and
well
worth
the
10
99
a
sixpack
this
is
generally
a
great
beer
no
fills
great
flavor
id
love
to
try
this
on
draft
is
it
available
anywhere
still
i
am
very
happy
i
can
buy
this
locally
recommended
d
overall
drank
like
a
sweetened
festbier
though
a
tad
to
much
so
for
multiples
more
macro
then
micro
mouthfeeldrinkability
prickly
and
animated
on
the
tip
of
the
tongue
then
becoming
slick
like
the
foam
at
the
edge
of
a
mellow
wave
down
the
jersey
shore
a
textural
pleasure
and
an
allday
drinker
without
a
doubt
a
little
more
punch
on
the
palate
would
really
have
driven
this
score
up
a
notch
d
this
is
a
great
session
beer
this
is
the
epitome
of
a
great
helles
beer
md
mildly
carbonated
and
refreshing
enough
on
the
texture
this
is
a
very
decent
helles
with
a
healthy
balance
and
lovely
aftertaste
looks
a
brilliant
clear
gold
with
a
white
head
smells
of
bland
sweet
malts
with
a
little
yeast
character
theres
more
malt
and
a
little
hop
character
in
the
flavor
making
for
a
beer
thats
just
a
step
above
your
average
euro
pale
lager
not
bad
just
not
very
complex
washes
down
mexican
quesadillas
loaded
with
peppers
quite
nicely
pours
a
clear
straw
gold
some
white
head
that
does
not
stick
around
nice
airy
clean
nose
with
not
a
lot
punching
my
senses
really
flavor
has
a
good
profile
nice
earthy
and
grainy
qualities
to
it
no
skunk
no
metal
smooth
feel
has
a
fair
amount
of
carbonation
in
there
liquid
feel
is
fairly
thick
as
well
but
in
a
lager
sense
of
it
all
definitely
drinkable
smooth
and
fairly
well
bodied
drinkability
a
very
nice
refreshing
beer
from
one
of
munichs
best
breweries
thierry
13102007
to
my
mind
this
is
an
eminently
drinkable
beer
it
is
flavorful
yet
dangerously
easy
to
swallow
very
refreshing
it
also
made
me
think
quite
a
good
deal
about
what
the
average
b
a
expects
from
a
quality
brew
most
of
us
are
looking
for
the
extreme
hop
punch
a
beer
over
the
top
in
bitterness
and
a
b
v
but
for
many
others
around
the
world
who
appreciate
good
beer
more
moderate
flavors
are
appealing
a
quaffable
but
very
flavorful
brew
one
that
can
be
enjoyed
either
in
bulk
or
moderation
is
not
a
bad
thing
i
think
sometimes
many
of
us
hold
strong
to
our
bigger
is
bettermore
bang
for
the
buck
attitudes
and
forget
about
the
values
of
moderation
simplicity
and
subtleness
augustiner
edelstoff
is
a
very
fine
beer
yet
i
feel
that
many
bas
sadly
would
not
share
this
opinion
overall
a
very
tasty
helles
good
representation
of
the
style
p
s
i
am
not
sure
the
style
is
described
correctly
i
would
rather
believe
this
to
be
an
export
style
taste
is
a
little
malty
with
a
whiff
of
hoppiness
i
can
taste
some
cinnamon
not
something
i
ever
tasted
in
a
lager
the
yeast
produces
a
clean
beer
body
is
medium
to
thin
a
rather
disappointing
beer
rather
ungerman
drinkability
is
good
but
lacks
in
the
malt
and
hop
department
just
wish
i
could
get
this
on
tap
locally
will
need
to
move
to
munchen
im
betting
its
going
to
be
some
delicious
smelling
drool
zum
wohl
i
had
this
on
tap
at
the
augustiner
keller
beer
hall
in
munich
the
appearance
was
muted
straw
color
a
little
murky
but
mostly
clear
with
a
massively
thick
head
i
always
see
this
head
in
the
1l
beer
mugs
in
munich
the
aroma
was
mostly
malts
a
little
bit
like
fresh
baked
bread
just
a
hint
of
hops
the
flavor
is
biscuity
and
bready
malt
slightly
sweet
and
very
lightly
bitter
in
the
aftertaste
extremely
drinkable
and
i
would
have
ordered
another
except
i
wanted
to
try
some
other
beers
of
munich
in
my
short
stay
definitely
clean
and
drinkable
flavor
lingers
nicely
but
never
announce
themselves
d
yes
yes
and
yes
great
beer
raw
in
your
face
noble
hop
aroma
just
amazing
poured
a
tiny
bright
white
head
that
disappeared
when
i
looked
away
transparent
pale
golden
beer
holds
a
few
lazily
rising
bubbles
the
pale
malts
provide
a
lightly
sweet
base
that
balances
out
the
earthygrassy
hop
flavors
the
hop
flavors
intensify
in
the
finish
as
they
are
joined
by
a
nice
bitter
bite
it
has
a
solid
and
crisp
mouthfeel
the
hop
flavor
doesnt
approach
the
strength
of
the
aroma
but
that
could
be
a
good
thing
in
the
end
this
is
one
nice
beer
prost
beertracker
d
not
sure
about
this
one
i
enjoyed
its
easy
drinkability
but
flavor
was
somewhat
of
a
concern
lagers
are
on
the
whole
more
subtle
but
i
found
myself
searching
for
the
characteristics
of
this
beer
too
hard
still
refreshing
and
light
to
say
the
least
edit
the
imported
bottle
version
is
also
wonderful
its
held
up
remarkably
well
so
definitely
grab
it
too
i
havent
tasted
many
helles
lager
beers
before
so
unfortunately
i
cant
compare
this
to
many
other
of
this
style
d
drinkable
but
not
the
best
helles
ive
had
from
a
bottle
here
in
the
state
im
sure
having
this
on
tap
in
germany
or
here
would
be
much
better
it
is
what
it
is
this
is
from
those
who
have
tried
them
all
in
munich
the
konig
of
the
helles
lagers
great
clarity
in
the
glass
nice
white
foamy
head
that
doesnt
last
long
a
bit
of
hops
in
the
nose
and
the
taste
is
a
very
well
balanced
malt
with
delicate
floral
hops
the
mouthfeel
leaves
a
lot
to
be
desired
but
it
is
oh
so
drinkable
and
smooth
such
a
treat
clearly
a
step
down
from
out
of
the
barrel
in
munich
but
worth
buying
all
and
all
very
drinkable
i
preferred
this
one
to
the
helles
actually
this
poured
out
a
bright
golden
color
with
a
bright
white
head
and
lacing
that
lasts
longer
than
dr
coxs
speeches
on
scrubs
the
nose
had
some
fresh
grain
a
little
hops
and
some
fruity
apple
type
notes
the
taste
was
super
clean
some
biscuit
maltyness
and
a
sort
of
apple
sauceapple
cider
thing
going
on
faint
in
the
background
drinks
very
refreshing
and
clean
with
a
crisp
dry
mouthfeel
cheers
d
overall
this
is
a
good
outdoor
hot
summer
day
beer
nothing
particularly
outstanding
but
definitely
nothing
wrong
with
this
beer
mouthfeel
was
mildly
zesty
and
medium
bodied
easy
to
drink
but
not
especially
interesting
drinkability
a
light
and
easy
to
drink
beer
but
flavor
profile
is
a
bit
milder
than
expected
definitely
a
refreshing
summer
beer
poured
a
pale
yellow
color
with
modest
white
head
head
rapidly
fell
to
a
very
thin
ring
with
no

smell
is
very
light
with
slight
summer
fruit
notes
present
taste
shows
a
nice
firm
maltiness
that
is
extraordinarily
refreshing
kleaves
a
very
tantanlizing
taste
in
the
mouth
really
a
nice
example
of
the
style
d
easily
poundable
high
drinkability
drinkability
in
very
good
went
well
with
grilled
chicken
and
brats
with
mexican
rice
mk
pale
golden
color
with
an
inch
high
head
which
dwindles
to
near
nothingness
and
leaves
scant
lacing
bready
aroma
with
notes
of
sharp
herbal
acidity
taste
matches
aroma
body
is
light
and
weak
and
the
flavors
as
well
are
quite
light
and
weak
plus
they
really
arent
too
enjoyable
a
slight
buttery
breadiness
holds
the
body
while
the
hops
which
are
grassy
come
into
the
finish
lower
carbonation
smooths
the
beer
out
but
really
also
bores
any
taste
im
disappointed
this
is
the
slightly
stronger
version
of
the
augustiner
hell
a
bit
more
estery
but
still
smooth
this
is
also
served
at
the
oktoberfest
there
with
6
abv
called
wiesnedel
i
personally
when
in
muenchen
prefer
the
hell
well
done
brewers
i
tasted
this
brew
on
tap
at
the
augustiner
grostgastatte
munich
recently
i
did
not
take
notes
for
a
review
but
it
offered
so
much
more
than
what
i
have
written
above
more
bitter
then
the
helles
but
very
worthwhile
maybe
its
a
beer
that
does
not
travel
overall
completely
nondescript
a
little
weak
in
the
flavor
department
these
guys
can
do
better
in
the
style
we
know
they
can
a
very
good
german
lager
lightly
flavored
and
textured
aromas
are
crisp
and
light
medium
maltiness
and
a
bit
grainy
but
not
bad
flavors
of
mint
and
grannysmith
apples
spice
the
beer
up
a
bit
still
light
and
clean
on
the
palate
finishes
crisp
and
clean
it
could
have
a
bolder
malt
and
hop
profile
but
not
if
it
means
less
crispnenss
its
better
than
most
german
lagers
drinkability
was
just
average
better
than
some
but
it
didnt
stand
out
this
beer
pours
a
crystal
clear
pale
gold
with
a
twofinger
rocky
snow
white
head
it
does
look
a
touch
washed
out
but
thankfully
that
does
not
translate
to
the
aroma
or
flavor
this
is
perfectly
balanced
in
every
way
and
gets
significant
yet
pleasant
contributions
from
the
bready
malt
and
the
hops
a
grassy
quality
dominates
but
there
are
some
surprisingly
nice
gentle
fruity
elements
apples
and
pears
as
well
the
best
part
is
how
fresh
and
creamy
it
all
comes
across
the
moderate
carbonation
and
bitterness
make
for
a
dangerously
easy
drinking
experience
but
my
preference
would
be
that
both
could
be
a
bit
higher
still
it
is
a
heck
of
a
beer
bb

great
presance
with
good
and
lasting
head
and
full
golden
and
cristal
clear
beer
wonderfull
nose
also
with
lots
of
finest
maltyness
and
great
hops
that
are
hard
to
define
but
perfume
the
beer
great
not
much
esters
or
yeastinfluence
except
for
the
alcohol
but
yeah
great
nose
as
is
taste
thats
full
litle
sweet
and
very
malty
good
hops
and
litle
alcoholic
woww
with
this
not
too
high
carbonisation
also
a
heaven
like
mouthfeel
well
what
can
you
say
a
perfect
sessionbeer
imo
pours
a
clear
gold
with
a
one
finger
stark
white
head
the
head
does
not
linger
for
long
and
becomes
a
thin
white
layer
on
top
of
the
beer
aroma
is
crisp
with
hints
of
cracker
bread
and
a
touch
of
grassy
spicyness
taste
is
crisp
clean
and
smooth
a
bit
of
malty
sweetness
up
front
followed
nicely
with
some
drying
slightly
bitter
hops
by
no
means
hoppy
but
the
hops
crisp
up
this
beer
nicely
mouthfeel
is
a
bit
heavier
than
i
would
have
guessed
nice
tight
carbonation
keeps
this
from
leadening
the
tongue
drinkability
is
good
a
very
good
session
helles
on
a
hot
day
a
mildly
sweet
and
mellow
maltiness
delicately
balances
with
a
drying
and
crisp
hoppiness
a
taste
of
limes
and
hint
of
minty
herbs
provide
a
very
nice
clean
and
refreshing
finish
an
ever
so
faint
fine
vodka
fuminess
is
noticeable
this
is
a
worldclass
lager
and
an
excellent
representation
of
the
style
final
thought
this
is
disappointing
from
a
world
class
brewery
but
i
had
to
try
it
for
the
price
and
availability
over
here
in
germany
some
hop
in
the
aftertaste
even
if
it
is
still
dominated
by
the
maltiness
pours
a
pale
straw
color
with
a
fluffy
eggshell
colored
head
doughy
haylike
pale
malt
aromas
some
german
noble
hops
and
a
hint
of
musty
yeast
crisp
and
effervescent
with
a
rich
maltiness
and
a
light
astringency
in
the
finish
easy
drinking
and
enjoyable
a
slight
bit
heftier
than
your
average
helles
did
not
enjoy
this
beer
any
more
than
i
would
a
miller
or
bud
light
other
than
nice
head
retention
there
were
no
appealing
qualities
in
its
looks
received
this
as
part
of
a
beer
of
the
worlds
mix
pack
and
am
not
sure
how
long
it
may
have
been
on
the
shelves
tastes
of
sweet
corn
maltiness
that
got
a
little
better
as
it
lost
some
of
its
chill
not
recommended
great
session
beer
poured
into
a
pint
glass
it
gave
about
a
one
inch
head
that
dissapated
fairly
quickly
it
has
a
clean
light
golden
color
it
couldnt
be
any
more
drinkable
there
is
a
light
lemon
undertone
and
simply
tastes
like
a
helles
lager
should
medium
body
with
mild
carbonation
smooth
and
clean
easy
summer
beach
beer
or
something
to
start
the
day
off
with
session
beer
all
the
way
john
found
this
beer
at
the
house
of
gluntz
here
in
chicago
this
place
is
if
i
remember
correctly
the
original
facility
of
chicagos
first
and
oldest
distributer
they
have
a
great
beer
book
by
the
way
dating
back
to
1888
they
mostly
have
wine
in
the
place
but
when
i
asked
for
cold
beer
they
pointed
to
a
hidden
little
cooler
that
was
busy
chilling
this
here
beer
a
few
awesome
cheeses
and
a
sprinkling
of
wine
anyway
a
cool
part
of
local
history
this
here
beer
poured
a
simple
buttery
golden
and
sported
a
decent
head
and
some
laceall
retreated
in
a
minute
to
a
cup
of
yellow
fizzy
water
aromas
were
decent
for
the
style
featuring
fresh
malty
grain
as
well
as
a
lemony
hop
profile
the
mouthfeel
was
nicely
crisp
yet
a
trifle
cloying
the
beer
does
taste
good
and
is
more
complex
than
most
for
the
style
flavors
run
fairly
deep
as
the
generous
grain
notes
give
way
to
a
fairly
long
hop
component
which
rewards
the
taster
with
a
cleansing
bitter
finish
this
is
a
fine
beer
to
start
with
but
it
begs
for
a
gear
change
after
two
drinkability
i
generally
dont
like
light
lagers
of
any
kind
i
can
drink
them
and
appreciate
them
but
i
enjoy
maltier
fullerbodied
brews
but
this
is
a
very
nice
beer
i
see
beer
writers
like
michael
jackson
describe
beers
as
soft
and
rounded
and
ive
always
wondered
what
that
means
i
think
this
is
a
good
example
of
both
its
a
simple
doughy
but
gently
dextrinous
and
smooth
in
mouthfeel
becomes
sweeter
as
it
warms
malty
goodness
that
is
enjoyable
biscuity
aroma
and
flavor
nice
peppery
hop
nice
easy
drinking
lager
with
character
bready
malt
notes
and
grassy
hops
blend
into
one
great
tasting
beer
has
a
light
skunkiness
on
the
aroma
but
the
taste
is
true
gold
i
would
call
it
light
bodied
epitome
of
a
sessionable
lager
picking
up
some
lemon
zest
on
the
finish
very
enjoyable
othis
is
a
great
lager
it
drinks
easily
packs
a
lot
of
flavor
but
doesnt
overwhelm
i
dont
know
enough
about
german
beers
to
say
if
this
is
truly
traditional
but
a
beer
like
this
is
what
i
think
of
when
i
think
of
good
light
german
lagers
i
would
happily
drink
more
of
this
a
fantastic
helles
with
the
touch
of
skunk
this
beer
unfortunately
reminds
me
of
a
heineken
which
actually
used
to
be
one
of
my
favorite
lawn
mowing
beers
there
is
no
freshness
date
on
the
label
i
see
these
beers
habitually
being
stored
warm
on
a
store
shelf
with
fluorescent
light
beating
down
on
them
as
it
is
this
beer
is
good
but
not
excellent
and
i
think
freshness
might
be
an
issue
here
i
paid
3something
for
the
bottle
oi
my
favorite
helles
currently
due
to
the
malt
and
hop
flavors
cant
wait
to
try
at
the
brewery
my
lone
nonmf
beer
today
i
just
had
to
go
for
a
nice
traditional
german
helles
this
stuff
pours
a
clear
straw
topped
by
a
finger
of
offwhite
foam
the
nose
comprises
flowers
mild
greens
and
a
hint
of
biscuit
the
taste
brings
in
more
of
the
same
the
hops
brighter
now
and
the
biscuit
and
greens
sweeter
a
tasty
combination
to
say
the
least
the
body
is
a
rather
light
medium
with
a
light
moderate
carbonation
and
a
crisp
finish
overall
you
gotta
hand
it
to
the
germans
for
continuing
to
produce
solid
enjoyable

say

you
can
do
no

here
i
could

so
clean
has
everything
a
perfect
helles
should
have
with
a

doesnt
have
any

frankly
a
disappointment
i
would
not
get
this
beer
again
as
i
would
get
most
of
their
other
kind
of
a
shame
o
after
remembering
such
good
things
about
andechs
and
thoroughly
enjoying
the
hefeweizen
im
just
a
little
surprised
at
how
lackluster
the
helles
is
the
malts
are
good
but
rather
weak
and
carry
a
drier
crackery
character
that
i
find
in
some
bavarian
helles
that
dont
prove
to
be
my
favorites
o
this
beer
is
an
excellent
representation
of
the
style
and
has
lots
of
flavors
of
malts
and
hops
if
you
put
a
blindfold
on
me
i
could
picture
myself
drinking
this
in
a
biergarten
in
germany
bready
malt
lemon
pith
quenching
with
a
dry
grassy
finish
very
clean
light
bodied
crisp
and
well
carbonated
it
has
a
prototypical
and
flawless
helles
blueprint
very
drinkable
and
worth
trying
if
you
like
the
style
the
bee
is
clear
and
pale
golden
with
a
small
white
head
the
aroma
offers
lightly
toasted
bread
german
malts
lightly
sweet
with
a
dry
finish
perfectly
balanced
with
pleasant
hop
character
so
smooth
i
could
drink
this
by
the
liter
stellar
o
this
is
a
very
fine
helles
that
id
be
glad
to
have
at
anytime
yum
i
got
this
at
bierkraft
in
brooklyn
while
picking
up
a
wet
hop
blue
point
bottle
this
refreshing
and
tasty
beer
is
very
bright
in
the
glass
poured
from
the
500
ml

golden
hay
notes
overlay
the

nose
great
balanced
flavor
with
plenty
of
heft
for
a
helles
even
better
as
it
warms
up
this
is
a
very
well
made
extremely
enjoyable
beer
o
more
export
than
helles
very
drinkable
this
beer
was
a
perfect
beer
to
start
my
evening
light
crisp
very
drinkable
it
paired
well
with
some
almonds
i
was
eating
overall
a
good
brew
they
made
this
one
so
you
would
want
one
after
another
i
like
it
definitely
recommend
to
anyone
did
not
score
a
t
s
m
at
that
time
disregard
those
scores
o
a
plain
excellent
beer
in
all
what
helles
are
supposed
to
be
just
very
very
good
o
a
question
comes
to
mind
can
the
brewer
at
andechs
brew
a
product
that
isnt
top
notch
in
my
opinoin
no
not
even
in
his
sleep
yet
another
fantastic
bavarian
beer
o
im
very
impressed
it
is
a
lovely
beer
i
doubt
id
ever
get
tired
of
a
couple
of
these
a
week
overall
an
ok
beer
but
not
strongly
recommended
beer
is
medium
to
mediumlight
bodied
with
active
refreshing
carbonation
that
is
slightly
prickly
on
the
tongue
but
pleasing
and
effective
with
the
beers
nature
overall
mouthfeel
is
crisp

smooth

makes
taking
another

was
rich
slick
malt
with
a
hint
of
fruity
hops
and
a
nice
rounded
lager
flavor
that
ended
with
just
a
touch
of
bitterness
exactly
the
kind
of
beer
youd
expect
from
a
legendary
german
brewery
that
said
there
was
a
hint
of
residual
oxidation
cardboardlike
flavor
that
surprised
me
because
the
bottles
are
so
fresh
a
common
off
flavor
in
bottled
germans
its
almost
unheardof
in
kegged
beers
but
the
bottom
line
was
that
this
one
was
fantastic
rich
mouthfeel
much
more
so
than
their
regular
lager
and
my
favorite
from
this
multipack
made
me
wish
i
could
taste
it
on
tap
myself
someday
overall
a
must
have
with
a
trip
to
the
holy
mountain
alongside
the
plethora
of
beer
that
this
monastery
pumps
out
this
is
a
good
base
for
the
magnificence
that
this
place
will
bestow
upon
your
taste
buds
gogogogo
i
find
this
beer
to
be
a
very
drinkable
refreshing
lager
i
can
see
getting
in
trouble
drinking
too
much
of
it
too
drinkable
for
this
higher
alcohol
beer
d
a
very
nice
beer
i
mention
the
fact
that
i
dont
generally
like
lagers
on
every
lager
review
i
have
ever
done
but
i
have
respect
for
this
one
its
clean
and
flavorful
decent
carbonation
maybe
a
little
less
than
usual
with
a
full
mouthfeel
silkier
than
usual
overall
i
like
this
but
dont
feel
the
need
to
search
it
out
again
there
are
others
i
can
find
in
the
usa
that
scratch
the
itch
just
as
well
the
taste
is
mostly
just
grain
with
some
faint
white
bread
a
bit
of
very
light
fruit
feel
is
a
bit
light
and
creamy
with
lowish
carbonation
some
nice
flavors
throughout
but
fairly
plain
without
much
to
really
draw
me
in
beer
is
light
in
body
and
pretty
bitter
from
the
grains
on
the
back
end
its
mildly
sweet
up
front
this
is
the
least
favorite
of
the
three
lagers
from
andechs
ive
had
recently
it
lacks
a
little
bit
of
something
its
too
thin
too
bitter
finishes
too
dry
still
a
good
helles
though
but
in
a
gestaltian
sense
its
more
than
the
mere
componentsits
perfectly
balanced
expertly
tuned
and
a
paragon
of
craftsmanship
its
simply
one
of
the
best
beers
in
a
country
skilled
in
the
art
of
brewing
its
as
german
as
apple
pie
is
americanand
no
less
delicious
notes
best
before
181010
a
very
nice
easy
to
drink
beer
well
balanced
with
a
good
amount
of
flavor
made
for
a
great
beer
to
sip
on
a
sunny
and
warm
day
refreshing
and
has
just
the
right
amount
of
hops
to
keep
it
interesting
definitely
worth
a
try
if
you
can
get
it
overall
an
average
lager
im
glad
i
had
it
but
would
choose
other
brews
from
andechs
before
selecting
this
one
again
drinkability
very
high
like
everything
else
from
this
kloster
enjoy
whenever
available
d
very
easy
to
drink
due
to
the
light
flavor
profile
the
excellent
feel
helps
the
drinkability
quite
a
bit
as
it
goes
down
easy
and
without
any
unpleasant
side
effects
aftertaste
bloat
etc
still
its
a
little
too
bland
for
me
to
use
as
a
lawnmower
beer
d
very
drinkable
my
wife
and
i
polished
off
a
few
in
a
short
time
as
an
edit
after
several
months
this
beer
truly
is
the
best
of
the
munich
helles
augustiner
pulls
a
close
second
but
the
andechs
holds
a
slightly
spicer
peppery
edge
that
really
puts
it
out
on
top
the
sweetness
is
in
perfect
check
and
now
after
drinking
a
perfectly
fresh
bottle
made
2
days
ago
im
editing
the
review
for
top
place
of
course
it
is
a
very
good
beer
and
there
was
nothing
wrong
with
it
we
just
expect
more
from
an
andechser
thats
it
edit

on
my
visit
during
611
i
had
the
opposite
reaction
i
definitely
preferred
this
one
to
the
normal
hell
and
enjoyed
it
quite
a
bit
maybe
this
time
id
had
more
pilsners
and
wasnt
burt
out
on
helles
beers
but
i
found
this
to
be
outstanding
clean
and
refreshing
it
is
interesting
and
exciting
it
isnt
flavor
is
very
good
much
fuller
than
an
average
helles
beer
theres
a
pronounced
hop
presence
and
bitter
aftertaste
as
well
sweeter
and
fuller
than
a
pils
similar
bitterness
as
well
but
more
complex
id
say
good
subtle
carbonation
and
a
smooth
drink
overall
an
enjoyable
brew
at
nearly
6
something
id
have
again
taste
is
very
malty
with
some
wort
notes
there
is
a
small
sweetness
which
makes
the
beer
mild
the
hops
are
nicely
balanced
and
balance
the
heavy
malts
drinkability
is
good
the
yeast
is
clean
and
produces
only
minor
sulfur

bright
straw

crowned
by
a

the

the
taste
is
like
a
light
belgian
something
like
watered
down
mollasses
light
malt
some
belgian
candi

well

easy

this

lager
poured
a
clear
golden
color
with
tall
creamy
bright
white
foam
that
persisted
and
clinged
to
the
glass
leaving
lace
there
was
good
carbonation
from
the
bottom
of
the
glass
the
smell
was
mildly
hoppy
with
some
floral
hops
notes
the
taste
was
dry
malt
with
some
biscuity
malt
flavor
and
balance
with
a
good
moderate
hoppiness
the
mouthfeel
was
smooth
and
crisp
with
medium
body
and
good
carbonation
the
hops
came
through
in
the
finish
and
lingered
fading
to
leave
a
nice
maltiness
in
the
aftertaste
this
was
a
very
nice
easy
to
drink
german
lager
as
with
all
helles
lagers
you
really
have
to
drink
them
fresh
to
fully
appreciate
them
d
not
something
i
would
seek
out
i
like
other
beers
from
this
brewery
compared
to
their
other
beers
this
is
in
no
way
impressive
at
all
md
fullbodied
and
brilliantlytextured
with
ever
so
soft
carbonation
to
caress
the
tongue
while
remaining
refreshing
and
lively
not
at
all
like
a
5
9abv
beer
this
is
easily
the
best
strong
pale
lager
ive
encountered
for
a
long
while
apart
from
its
czech
counterparts
which
i
still
prefer
a
fine
and
solid
product
yet
it
could
be
even
better
to
me
if
only
the
overall
malt
sweetness
softens
a
little
bit

unassuming

can

another

sweet

with
and

together
into

with
a
light
fizz
in

and
nice
sharp
bite
in
the
end
a

juicy
pilsesque
beer
a
rereshing
beer
that
isnt
just
for
hot
days
i
must
say
its
not
a
bad
helles
even
so
probably
the
only
thing
that
enhanced
its
personality
was
the
scenario
i
tasted
it

wins
out
this
bottle
brought
back
conjures
up
many
fond
memories
not
one
of
us
is
a
lager
fan
however
so
coming
from
this
family
this
rating
is
way
above
average
overall
impression
not
my
cup
of
tea
good
quality
but
the
hopbitterness
was
over
the
top
to
me
the
late
malt
presence
helped
good
hell
not
exceptional
good
drinkability
refreshing
but
not
interesting
delicious
smooth
coating
and
creamy
mouthfeel
and
an
excellent
example
of
a
style
i
usually
dont
enjoy
throughout
is
a
delicious
light
fruitiness
and
a
buttery
maltiness
with
lemon
honey
herbs
and
flowers
the
head
quickly
fades
into
a
thin
white
collar
on
a
clear
transparent
golden
color
body
the
smell
is
grainy
with
some
skunkiness
the
taste
is
very
very
grainy
with
a
deep
bitter
and
thick
hoppiness
the
mouthfeel
is
a
bit
more
complex
than
in
the
andechser
hell
but
its
still
not
amazing
a
veil
of
citrus
but
its
mostly
grainy
and
dry
and
not
really
interesting
i
got
bored
after
two
sips
even
considering
the
style
is
not
one
of
my
favorite
i
cant
find
anything
exceptional
in
this
watery
beer
a
disappointment
in
comparison
with
the
hefe
weizen
or
the
bergbock
yum
actually
the
more
this
sits
in
the
mouth
the
more
i
have
to
conclude
that
its
one
of
the
finest
lagers
thats
ever
been
there
just
nice
very
very
nice
always
that
honeylemon
flavor
however
mild
but
always
noticable
and
just
an
eternal
reward
yum
again
thanks
you
german
monks
i
hope
to
taste
your
brew
again
some
sweet
day
ahh
andechs
i
was
thrilled
to
see
this
appear
on
tap
in
a
previously
unremarkable
german
restaurant
served
in
a
logo
glass
better
designed
for
a
wheat
beer
this
pearl
came
out
clear
vibrant
gold
under
a
two
finger
white
head
with
great
retention
and
very
nice
lacing
action
the
aroma
was
nice
and
hoppy
with
sweet
malt
to
balance
the
mouth
was
mildly
carbonated
and
slightly
cloying
the
taste
is
what
it
should
be
nice
smooth
sweet
malt
chased
by
a
mild
but
distinct
hoppy
bitterness
the
aftertaste
is
pure
goldilocks
not
too
bitter
not
too
sweet
this
is
a
good
beer
listed
as
5
9abv
on
this
fresh
german
bottle
this
is
a
classic
helles
lager
that
pours
out
a
very
light
golden
colour
with
a
small
white
head
of
foam
the
aromas
are
classic
munich
malts
light
floral
hops
and
that
zesty
german
spice
the
taste
is
spicy
and
malty
classic
for
a
german
lager
the
mouthfeel
is
spritzy
dry
and
clean
the
drinkability
is
great
a
great
beer
from
this
brewery
that
sadly
does
not
import
their
beers
to
the
usa
very
pale
yellow
colour
sweet
malts
at
the
start
with
some
herbal
hops
towards
the
finish
medium
bitter
finish
a
bit
uninspiring
but
not
bad
quite
quaffable
i
guess
i
was
expecting
more
given
the
other
fine
beers
this
brewer
is
responsible
for
but
not
bad
as
i
said
a
pretty
good
beer
overall
one
that
i
cant
wait
to
get
straight
from
the
source
pat
the
typical
lagerpils
color
a
sparkling
gold
as
it
sets
in
my
glass
the
head
majestic
in
its
presence
the
color
a
brilliant
white
as
it
deflates
leaving
behind
a
delicate
coating
of
lace
on
the
glass
crisp
clean
lager
nose
with
the
malt
dominate
but
also
present
an
underlying
musty
aroma
as
you
sample
the
semisweet
front
is
the
precedent
to
the
middling
top
and
the
bitingly
carbonated
finish
that
combined
with
the
purposeful
hop
spiciness
makes
this
a
top
notch
lager
dry
as
a
bone
aftertaste
and
quite
a
pleasure
to
quaff
and
that
is
high
praise
from
this
loyal

offflavors
galore
i
was
able
to
choke
it
down
but
it
was
a
bit
of
a
struggle
its
a
simple
lager
that
shows
visitors
of
the
brewery
that
theres
more
to
beer
than
just
the
banal
taste
thats
marked
on
nascars

by
talking

o
this
is
one
of
the
most
uninspiring
helles
ive
tried
in
a
long

very

the

then
it
is

taste
is
very
uneventful
and
lacks
any
true
charateristic
disappointing
overall
we
have
found
this
lacking
in
any
real
beer
flavor
a

with

to
a
thin

in

a

gentle
mild

these
words
above
are
the
description
of
the
overall
and
the
mouthfeel
guess
light

drinkability
due
to
the
balanced
ease
with
which
the
velas

presents
itself
good
prost
almost
inch
thick
creamy
like
head
tastes
very
similar
to
the
german
style
beers
that
it
is
modeled
after
great
lacing
looked
like
spider
webs
down
the
sides
of
the
glass
appearance
was
golden
yellow
didnt
bother
to
smell
it
mouthfeel
is
how
i
believe
a
beer
should
be
very
drinkable
lets
just
say
i
had
more
than
one
the
bartender
gave
me
a
shot
of
cherokee
red
after
i
told
him
how
bad
it
was
when
i
tryed
it
still
tasted
like
shit
overall
this
is
one
hell
of
a
balanced
clean
grainy
hopappropriated
helles
some
stickiness
to
the
very
end
but
like
the
pils
which
i
recall
has
a
lot
in
common
with
this
it
is
a
pleasant
aftertaste
should
it
cleanse
the
palate
totally
i
dont
know
because
i
have
never
been
to
a
deuschland
biergarten
drinking
the
bavarian
greats
but
i
like
the
unamericanlightlagerresidual
this
would
go
nicely
in
one
of
my
corny
kegs
drinkability
velas
is
a
tidy
tasty
refreshing
helles
thats
quite
drinkable
drinks
solidly
as
it
is
intended
to
and
thats
why
im
a
lager
guy
not
because
i
have
no
palette
and
cant
appreciate
anything
except
fizzy
yellow
beer
i
enjoy
my
share
of
hops
and
sours
and
fruit
and
funk
but
when
you
get
right
down
to
it
food
is
a
nostalgic
experience
as
opposed
to
a
collectors
or
academic
one
eat
what
you
like
drink
what
you
like
lagerists
lageristas
appreciate
the
subtle
nuance
of
form
we
dont
need
big
bold
bombs
going
off
in
our
mouths
or
extreme
heat
abv
to
get
us
into
bed
bring
us
the
graded
shades
of
taste
and
well
supply
the
rest
the
tartness
in
this
beer
is
quite
light
but
it
is
distinct
this
would
certainly
point
to
an
infection
of
some
sort
the
overcarbonation
could
be
a
sign
of
this
as
well
and
it
certainly
does
take
this
beer
out
of
style
as
the
beer
warms
up
the
honey
notes
in
the
nose
start
to
take
on
a
bit
more
fruitiness
not
bad
but
certainly
not
what
i
was
expecting
or
hoping
for
in
many
ways
it
reminds
me
of
a
berliner
weiss
it
is
not
quite
there
though
as
the
sourness
would
need
to
be
a
bit
more
gripping
actually
if
this
was
labled
as
a
berliner
weiss
i
would
have
enjoyed
it
quite
a
bit
more
as
it
does
have
a
nice
clean
tartness
to
it
12oz
bottle
into
a
lucifer
tulip
pours
a
crisp
pale
gold
with
a
thin
diminishing
offwhite
head
aroma
is
just
a
trace
of
sweet
malts
the
taste
is
a
slight
amount
of
sweet
malts
and
and
just
a
hint
of
hops
the
beer
is
light
and
crisp
but
a
bit
on
the
watery
side
this
is
one
textbook
mediocrity
before
i
buy
another
ill
have
to
taste
it
first
heres
to
hoping
something
just
went
wrong
medium
body
effervescence
a
solid
helles
but
not
a
standout
overall
not
a
bad
little
lager
though
the
subtleties
were
severely
lacking
it
was
still
fairly
decent
i
would
see
no
issue
with
throwing
this
down
on
a
hot
day
though
i
am
sure
there
are
much
better
lagers
out
there
for
sure
i
am
not
really
sure
what
to
take
away
from
this
one
as
it
is
a
hard
style
to
really
having
any
different
in
but
i
still
feel
even
given
that
this
is
barely
above
average
in
any
regard
d
i
would
say
its
about
like
a
typical
mainstream
domestic
lager
beer
but
slightly
better
than
most
its
not
my
favorite
style
i
was
impressed
with
the
porter
that
smoky
mountain
brewery
made
and
took
a
bottle
of
this
home
as
well
just
to
try
i
think
its
a
good
beer
for
those
that
dont
stray
far
from
the
miller
lite
and
coors
kind
of
beers
the
taste
was
smooth
and
sweet
it
almost
tastes
like
a
white
grape
juice
in
my
opinion
for
a
lighter
beer
i
would
say
it
was
quite
flavorful
i
would
take
this
over
any
main
stream
light
beer
any
day
overall
its
a
good
beer
and
certainly
better
than
any
macro
you
could
get
a
hold
of
but
nothing
special
drinkability
a
good
summertime
beer
although
the
carbonation
detracts
from
this
beer
drinkability
is
high
as
the
beer
feels
light
but
is
very
flavorful
had
this
on
tap
at
the
brewery
in
pigeon
forge
the
bartender
told
me
this
was
comparable
to
corona
although
i
thought
it
had
more
flavor
and
was
a
bit
fuller
in
body
than
a
corona
has
a
light
golden
color
with
a
small
white
foamy
head
that
was
gone
rather
quickly
has
a
faint
aroma
with
a
bit
of
citrus
at
the
end
the
taste
was
very
light
and
sweet
with
a
bit
of
malt
and
hops
but
nothing
overpowering
this
could
definately
be
a
session
beer
or
one
to
drink
on
a
hot
day
of
doing
yard
work
but
still
it
is
just
an
average
brew
compared
to
the
brewerys
other
offerings
but
still
a
nice
fizzy
refreshment
at
the
right
time
or
to
give
to
someone
that
might
be
scared
off
by
a
heartier
brew
this
is
a
beer
that
i
feel
the
brewmaster
intends
to
mimic
a
corona
for
the
macro
crowd
it
is
much
better
than
a
corona
but
i
do
see
tourists
drink
this
with
a
lime
which
is
not
required
it
has
a
standard
straw
yellow
look
with
low
carbonation
and
thin
head
a
very
mild
aroma
that
hints
at
a
very
mild
sweet
grain
nose
taste
has
a
smooth
grain
accent
with
the
lightest
touch
of
hops
on
finishing
mouthfeel
is
thin
and
somewhat
watery
drinkability
is
big
as
it
seems
to
quaff
better
with
each
successive
pint
not
my
first
nor
second
choice
from
this
brewpub
but
a
pretty
nice
option
in
warmer
months
this
beer
has
been
watered
down
to
appease
the
masses
as
it
had
much
more
character
and
taste
when
it
was
first
brewed
gold
medal
helles
at
the
gabf
in
99
this
beer
is
very
light
in
color
there
is
a
small
head
the
smell
is
very
slightly
of
hops
the
taste
is
pretty
bland
with
few
flavors
showing
up
the
mouthfeel
is
pretty
smooth
and
a
little
bit
oily
the
drinkability
is
good
i
could
session
this
beer
no
problem
not
a
bad
beer
just
plain
so
far
this
is
the
worst
that
i
have
tried
from
smokey
mountain
brewery
it
could
be
a
lawn
mower
beer
but
if
thats
what
you
want
why
not
go
to
the
local
grocery
and
get
the
cheapest
macro
in
cans
f
this
brew
i
hate
it
this
one
was
fairly
enjoyable
though
not
great
overall
fix
the
appearance
and
smell
a
bit
first
i
e
make
them
bolder
and
they
may
be
on
to
something
here
drinkability
while
well
crafted
the
flavor
is
too
lemony
for
my
liking
still
it
disappeared
awfully
fast
pours
a
very
pale
yellow
with
small
white
head
that
falls
way
to
quick
aroma
is
light
some
malt
some
grassy
hops
not
much
going
on
here
taste
is
a
little
more
maltier
then
their
pilsner
maybe
a
touch
more
hops
also
but
overall
just
as
soon
have
the
thunder
road
not
much
diffrence
between
the
two
mouthfeel
is
light
and
drinkability
is
ok
goes
down
quick
and
is
refreshing
this
brewery
is
making
their
stuff
to
appeal
to
bud
drinkers
none
of
their
beers
are
very
taste
intensive
made
not
to
offend
anyone
i
guess
perhaps
the
least
personality
of
the
beers
ive
had
from
this
brewery
very
mild
with
some
malt
caramel
flavors
hopping
was
modest
but
the
overall
flavor
profile
was
fresh
and
clean
nothing
wrong
with
this
beer
it
just
really
does
not
distinguish
itself
in
any
way
thanks
to
johnrobe
for
sending
me
this
the

with
the

even
a

with
an
unimposing

flavor
with
some
malt
and

as
well
finish
is

complexity
is
not

this

the

youre
gonna
make
sure
its

they
were
pouring

its

the

not
this

i
feel

on

background
had
a
tall
can
of
this
wellknown
commercial
example
of
a
munich
helles
lager
in
the
classic
blue
and

colors
this
brew
pours
a
lemon
drop
yellow
with
a
massive
amount
of
white
head
unless
you
choose
to
mitigate
this
with
your

technique
but
this
way
you
will
get
more
of

releases
an
aroma
of
pale

and

yeast
smells
sweet

a

of

white
bread
bicarbonate
of

apple
sour

candy
grass
hay
and
some
white
pepper
spice
maybe
a
subtle
undercurrent
of
cherry
pit
which
could
very
well
be
something
i
am
inferring
for
an
unknown
reason
fairly
thin
body
and
quite
dry
as
per
the
style
but
in
all
honesty
i
get
a
fair
amount
of
sweetness
here
too
that
was
detectable
even
by
the
nonbeer
geeks
who
accompanied
me
despite
the
massive
billowing
head
the
beer
was
only
moderately
fizzy
and
perhaps
i
let
much
of
the
gas
escape
during
the
pour
finishes
fairly
dry
with
a
lingering
green
noble
hop
spicy
bitterness
that
evokes
melon
rind
all
in
all
a
pretty
complex
and
tasty
yet
delicate
brew
that
hits
the
right
stylistic
notes
even
if
it
is
a
bit
on
the
sweet
side
i
could
detect
no
obvious
flaws
overall
not
bad
but
not
particularly
interesting
either
seems
too
thin
and
mild
to
hold
up
to
food
and
not
enough
flavor
to
be
interesting
by
itself
inoffensive
but
is
that
something
to
be
celebrated
od
well
done
but
not
awe
inspiring
for
the
style
its
pretty
tasty
and
the
price
is
right
drinkable
overall
solid
beer
all
around
and
while
not
the
gold
standard
of
the
style
certainly
an
affordable
accessible
entry
that
is
inoffensive
as
can
be
but
is
a
huge
improvement
over
the
general
swill
overall
its
a
pretty
decent
lager
the
hoppiness
is
not
as
strong
or
existent
at
all
for
that
matter
as
i
would
have
liked
but
the
beer
looks
great
and
has
a
fantastic
clean
taste
with
fruity
undertones
there
is
an
off
chance
ill
but
this
again
overall
an
excellent
beer
for
any
lager
or
german
beer
fans
highly
recommended
cheap
tasty
lager
nothing
special
but
when
im
hoping
for
a
few
cans
of
something
i
can
enjoy
without
really
worrying
too
much
about
it
sure
this
could
qualify
as
a
session
beer
but
i
cant
see
anyone
downing
more
than
one
or
two
in
a
sitting
while
this
wasnt
a
drain
pour
it
certainly
wasnt
anything
worth
remembering
either
there
could
have
been
more
of
a
breadbiscuitpotato
chip
starchy
fullness
to
this
to
give
the
beer
more
body
but
alas
this
was
pretty
watereddown
and
somewhat
generic
while
not
as
bad
as
other
european
beers
in
green
bottles
not
much
stood
out
about
this
either
this
is
only
worth
giving
it
a
go
if
youve
never
tried
it
as
previously
was
the
case
with
yours
truly
not
impressed
with
this
beer
smells
like
straight
apple
juice
virtually
no
sweetness
though
and
a
sort
of
flat
tasting
bite
thin
bronze
hue
slightly
pleasant
crisp
mouthfeel
but
not
as
crisp
as
my
old
standby
budweiser
tastes
pretty
cheap
but
i
can
sort
of
dig
that
kind
of
metallic
flavor
in
that
it
personally
brings
back
memories
of
getting
drunk
in
college
overall
didnt
like
it
but
it
wasnt
anything
nasty
and
beer
is
beer
lowenbrau
is
ok
not
feeling
this
beer
at
all
i
like
my
helleses
to
be
super
crisp
this
lowenbrau
fell
flat
for
me
not
as
clear
as
i
like
either
the
appearance
is
like
pale
tinged
yellow
smell
is
a
little
off
for
me
but
its
hard
for
me
to
pinpoint
it
exactly
overall
i
would
pass
on
this
beer
again
glad
i
tried
it
before
getting
the
six
pack
a
good
beer
for
its
price
highly
drinkable
and
pleasant
löwenbräu
original
is
a
satisfying
beer
that
has
a
good
balance
of
maltyness
and
hoppy
flavour
it
is
refreshing
and
a
good
representation
of
the
style
they
are
trying
to
convey
above
average
munich
helles
lager
and
a
good
german
macro
brew
o
this
beer
is
a
good
representation
of
the
style
while
also
being
very
drinkable
i
could
see
this
as
a
good
choice
for
someone
who
is
first
getting
into
beer
and
wanted
to
try
a
munich
helles
lager
for
the
first
time
meh
a
pretty
average
lager
this
is
a
shade
above
many
macro
products
at
least
the
malt
doesnt
taste
like
its
been
cut
with
adjuncts
however
it
lacks
depth
and
hoppy
notes
while
the
rather
harsh
finish
makes
for
a
subpar
experience
quenches
your
thirst
but
leaves
you
unsatisfied
no
need
to
seek
it
out
food
match
veal

with
a
side
of

a

for
the
style

flavor
to
bring
me
back
to
it
once
in
awhile
a
minor
upgrade
over
the
other
lousy
euro
beers
pours
golden
and
clear
with
a
decent
white
foam
head
an
inch
or
so
high
smells
like
there
might
be
a
little
hops
in
this
one
behind
the
light
pale
malt
aroma
is
a
crisp
bitterness
that
really
stands
out
after
drinking
hopless
stuff
all
summer
the
flavor
indicates
that
its
no
ipa
or
anything
but
there
is
a
slight
hop
presence
in
the
finish
that
is
a
very
welcomed
feature
its
crisp
and
clean
in
the
finish
quite
enjoyable
mouthfeel
is
consistent
with
the
style
a
little
more
body
and
a
little
less
carbonation
overall
a
trusty
go
to
brew
in
a
market
saturated
with
awful
beer
is
going
to
feel
so
so
good
its
so
much
like
water
o
decently
refreshing
not
interesting
at
all
totally
average
score
fits
perfectly
rjt
final
thoughts
all
in
all
just
a
very
simple
and
well
done
beer
this
is
what
the
generic
lager
should
be
instead
of
what
big
brewing
has
made
it
into
it
could
use
more
complexity
but
im
not
that
inclined
to
hold
that
against
this
beer
too
much
o
a
great
lager
and
example
of
the
variety
would
drink
it
again
in
a
pinch
d
overall
this
beer
seriously
lacks
in
the
flavor
department
and
delivers
a
rather
clean
crisp
lager
feel
minus
the
adjuncts
and
skunk

simple
summer
afternoon

too
much
and
would
drink
it
again
for
sure
dr
average
abv
decent
quality
and
very
drinkable
it
shouldnt
win
any
awards
but
its
worth
a
try
for
any
beer
fanatic
o
my
appreciation
for
this
one
isnt
as
high
as
it
used
to
be
pretty
average
stuff
an
easy
consumable
lager
could
have
a
more
bitter
bite
to
balance
sweet
and
sour
notes
a
bit
nostalgia
was
more
or
less
the
first
beer
i
choose
to
drink
when
i
came
to
age
overall
i
wouldnt
rave
about
this
beer
its
good
but
not
enough
character
for
my
taste
o
very
impressive
for
a
german
beer
o
if
this
is
not
skunked
which
is
a
big
if
its
pretty
enjoyable
nothing
spectacular
its
a
simple
and
decent
beer
that
is
reasonably
priced
o
k
drinkability
this
is
a
typical
mass
produced
european
light
lager
helles
while
it
isnt
the
best
beer
in
that
category
it
certainly
isnt
a
bad
beer
cheers
the
mouthfeel
is
perhaps
a
bit
light
but
i
have
not
had
a
beer
in
a
long
time
so
i
dont
really
care
the
carbonation
is
nice
the
beer
is
a
bit
plain
but
i
dont
really
have
any
other
options
in
jordan
if
i
were
back
in
germany
or
the
us
i
would
get
something
different
drinkability
perhaps
the
skunkiness
was
just
due
to
the
fact
i
bought
this
as
a
single
out
of
the
fridge
at
the
liquor
store
it
is
somewhat
nice
to
drink
this
was
the
first
beer
i
had
back
when
i
was
16
years
old
and
havent
had
one
since
1993
until
i
went
back
for
a
revisit
it
actually
is
not
a
bad
beer
and
some
respectable
flavorings
im
glad
i
went
back
for
a
revisit
i
still
remember
the
common
commercials
for
this
when
i
was
growing
up
ironically
it
seems
hard
to
find
now
and
i
guess
i
was
lucky
to
stumble
upon
some
in
an
obscure
little
store
poured
a
3
head
which
slowly
dissipated
to
nothing
clear
straw
yellow
sweet
corn
with
a
slight
zing
very
much
like
american
styles
but
with
a
longer
finish
basically
american
1
very
yellow
color
with
small
carbonation
virtually
no
head
at
all
just
a
thin
lace
normal
grassy
and
herbal
hop
smell
taste
is
just
good
not
too
unique
light
bodied
herbal
hops
and
a
little
sweetness
toward
end
this
beer
is
so
ok
worth
drinking
not
much
wrong
with
it
very
drinkable
overall
this
is
a
lighter
tasting
beer
but
it
is
easily
drinkable
with
a
good
balance
of
tastes
worth
a
try
seems
like
a
good
summer
beer
great
appearance
and
head
with
a
not
so
great
smell
at
first
its
bitter
and
has
some
bite
to
it
i
have
noticed
the
colder
it
is
the
better
surpassingly
even
with
the
bitter
initial
taste
it
is
a
smooth
beer
and
very
drinkable
my
friends
and
i
can
go
through
new
case
in
one
night
d
its
certainly
not
the
worst
macrobrew
you
could
get
but
why
bother
d
get
past
the
skunk
and
bitter
lemon
and
youll
find
bitter
asprin
chalky
nasties
taste
is
pretty
ok
nothing
too
bad
about
it
but
nothing
really
outstanding
either
its
pretty
unoffensive
and
comes
with
a
lot
of
grain
taste
to
it
kind
of
like
becks
from
the
can
aftertaste
is
slightly
dry
bitter
but
it
is
nothing
bad
at
all
overall
a
pretty
drinkable
beer
and
its
nothing
worth
complaining
of
from
the

sampled
on
november
5
2010
when
is
the
last
time
you
had
a
lowenbrau
in
the
usa
if
it
has
been
awhile
you
might
be
in
for
a
pleasant
surprise
instead
of
the
tasteless
corny
beer
of
the
1980s
and
1990s
it
is
now
the
original
recipe
imported
from
germany
the
pour
is
a
carbonated
yellow
with
about
a
halfinch
of
fizzy
longlasting
head
for
a
green
bottle
the
skunkiness
is
muted
in
favor
of
malts
thin
yeast
and
a
slightly
hopped
background
the
taste
is
tart
but
clean
with
barley
malts
and
light
hops
to
wrap
around
your
throat
if
you
gave
up
on
lowenbrau
years
ago
it
might
be
worth
another
shot
best
beer
around
hardly
but
drinkable
and
likeable

a
simple
easy

refreshig
german
lager
one
of

best

lagers
ive
ever
had

as

produced

goes

outstanding

drinkability
i
could
drink
a
few
of
these
beers
however
would
not
be
a

on

light
side
doesnt
pack
much
punch

isnt
too
disappointing

average

not

but
sort

uninspired
the
aroma
rubbed
me
the
wrong
way
but
it
wasnt
really
bad
my
suggestion
is
to
grab
some
skittles
and
make
yourself
some
skittlebrau
drink
a
nice
lighter
tasting
mildly
hoppy
beer
perfect
for
a
hot
summer
day
i
could
easily
drink
a
few
of
these
d
this
beer
is
made
for
chugging
the
tastes
are
subtle
but
fair
but
the
combo
of
thin
crisp
and
refreshing
make
you
forget
where
the
last
one
went
finishes
very
crisp
and
dry
but
the
mustiness
threw
me
off
a
bit
its
not
offensive
though
and
not
a
bad
choice
for
the
style
i
wish
our
big
name
beers
were
as
easy
to
swallow
as
this
perhaps
ill
keep
dreaming

the

the

of
the
beer
upped
and
left
im
not
sure
if
it
was
due
to
it
being
old
or
spoiled
but
i
dont
care
because
either
way
i
dont
feel
like
its
worth
going
back
to
theres
plenty
of
other
better
german
bottled
beers
out
in

a
decent
enough
helles
and
while
the
eurofeel
is
strong
in
this
one
im
not
grokking
a

of
originality
here
drinkable
in
quantity
im
sure
but
not
as
a
singular
pleasure
not
a
bad

i
think
id
rather
go
for
a

or
something

pleasantly
surprising
this
one
quite
refreshing

nothing

but
that
was
in

to
molson

and

lowenbrau
really
isnt

this
is
one
of
the
first
beers
i
ever
tried
when
i
first
got
into
this
whole
thing
nice
and
golden
at
the
pour
with
a
great
head
on
it
the
aroma
was
a
sign
of
things
to
come
for
me
in
the
way
of
european
beers
very
nice
thick
head
quickly
settles
to
thin
lace
a
good
lager
but
nothing
very
complex
and
nothing
really
stands
out
probably
not
as
good
in
bottle
or
can
but
tasty
from
the
pump
my
only
complaint
is
paying
premium
price
for
a
totally
average
beer
even
if
all
better
beers
should
match
or
exceed
lowenbraus
quality
to
separate
the
good
from
the
nongood
look
no
further
light
amber
in
color
with
moderate
head
with
large
bubbles
smells
somewhat
hoppy
and
spicy
taste
is
fresh
tasting
with
good
hop
bite
finishes
off
sweet
than
it
starts
a
slightly
above
average
brew
notes
not
bad
not
bad
at
all
surprise
surprise
this
brew
has
taken
a
turn
for
the
better
now
being
brewed
in
canada
under
contract
by
labatt
decent
use
of
hops
to
balance
the
malt
enough
to
suffice
any
beer
geek
and
not
too
much
to
turn
the
macro
drinker
away
give
it
a
try
its
ok
drinakble
clean
slightly
sweet
at
the
start
and
then
a
crisp
bitterness
fairly
light
on
in
body
and
flavour
very
good
impression
nice
pale
gold
holds
a
small
head
nothing
like
i
expected
not
as
hoppy
it
was
kinda
dry
on
the
finish
served
cold
it
is
crisp
with
a
hint
of
spice
seems
readily
available
up
north
never
saw
it
in
the
south
overall
not
a
bad
little
lager
though
the
subtleties
were
severely
lacking
it
was
still
fairly
decent
o
a
decent
helles
lager
and
one
of
saranacs
better
beers
easy
to
drink
a
few
in
a
night
off
tap
at
the
ugly
duckling
this
beer
was
a
pale
golden
color
with
one
finger
of
offwhite
foam
atop
it
lots
of
rising
carbonation
but
the
head
retention
was
poor
the
aroma
was
of
crystal
malt
some
toasted
malt
caramel
malt
and
pilsner
type
hops
the
flavors
were
above
average
for
saranac
and
i
thought
really
quite
good
i
tasted
grainy
malts
mostly
caramel
and
toasted
with
a
slight
note
of
corn
followed
by
the
crisp
czech
hops
it
was
the
use
of
the
hops
with
finesse
that
impressed
me
with
this
one
it
was
a
very
refreshing
beer
and
thus
much
more
drinkable
the
mouthfeel
was
creamy
the
body
medium
and
the
carbonation
average
for
an
inexpensive
locally
produced
brew
in
central
ny
look
to
this
gem
d
i
would
put
a
couple
back
in
the
sun
on
the
beach
but
not
very
many
at
home
in
the
winter
drinkability
actually
its
one
of
the
better
brews
oughta
the
2010
summer
box
light
easydrinking
refreshment
when
saranac
tends
to
take
on
somewhat
bolder
styles
the
effort
usually
ends
up
a
toolight
kindabland
version
of
the
style
but
when
they
aim
for
something
light
they
tend
to
hit
the
mark
taste
is
similar
nice
crisp
full
grain
character
with
light
apple
grass
hint
of
herb
it
is
dryish
with
a
grain
aftertaste
with
a
hint
of
lemon
and
herb
d
yeah
i
could
drink
a
few
of
these
good
for
the
summer
nice
and
mild
just
another
stop
in
the
leaving
falls
church
uberbender
it
pours
a
clear
pale
straw
topped
by
nearly
two
fingers
of
white
froth
the
nose
comprises
wheat
corn
syrup
and
flowers
the
taste
is
similar
but
sweeter
and
with
a
tinge
of
orangey
citrus
in
the
background
the
body
is
rather
light
with
a
light
carbonation
and
a
fairly
crisp
finish
wow
that
was
pretty
short
but
thats
what
i
took
away
from
this
brew
its
good
for
a
quick
quaff
but
nothing
to
sit
and
savor
very
much
the
finish
is
dry
and
satisfying
all
in
all
a
crisp
and
refreshing
lager
and
one
i
wouldnt
hesitate
to
purchase
again
if
i
saw
it
available
locally
feels
good
in
my
mouth
easily
confused
with
seltzer
yes
that
overlaps
with
its
lack
of
taste
however
does
remain
smooth
and
drinkable
for
sure
but
as
far
as
paying
the
craft
brew
premium
for
it
i
dont
think
so
d
you
might
reach
for
another
just
to
make
sure
you
didnt
miss
it
the
first
time
i
pulled
a
rabbit
out
of
my
hat
with
this
surprise
of
a
beer
from
my
saranac
variety
pack
my
curiousity
is
instantly
rewarded
can
it
happen
again
with
another
style
clear
straw
color
with
a
small
white
lacing
faint
honeylike
malt
aroma
with
hints
of
grass
honey
undertones
continue
in
the
flavor
with
doughy
malt
hops
are
light
and
lemony
and
adequately
clean
up
the
finish
creamy
body
medium
carbonation
smooth
nice
body
good
condition
clean
enough
for
a
helles
actually
quite
authentic
and
tasty
impressively
so
i
would
drink
this
often
if
it
were
available
here
without
the
rest
of
their
summer
pack
d
i
enjoyed
it
and
would
have
had
another
d
easy
to
drink
and
refreshing
this
beer
is
a
good
representation
of
this
classic
style
drinks
easy
a
okay
not
inspired
take
on
the
style
i
could
do
a
few
before
moving
on
next
golden
with
a
pure
white
finger
of
foam
that
leaves
fine
sheets
of
lace
on
the
glass
fresh
breadiness
in
the
nose
with
hay
and
noble
hops
a
pretty
trad
take
on
the
style
untoasted
grain
and
soft
fruity
esters
with
a
touch
dry
yeast
and
noble
hops
finishes
squeaky
clean
light
crisp
and
ultimately
easy
drinking
with
no
off
flavors
but
no
really
great
flavors
either
a
good
thirst
quencher
overall
a
pretty
fair
example
of
the
style
it
is
relatively
easy
to
drink
but
not
something
i
would
normally
or
regularly
choose
overall
a
fitting
piece
in
this
years
summer
sampler
light
yet
flavorful
enough
to
deserve
a
second
thought
and
good
enough
to
be
consumed
with
our
without
a
hot
dog
d
well
like
i
stated
before
i
really
dont
like
lagers
only
amber
lagers
and
this
one
was
ok
i
still
have
3
left
and
they
are
not
bad
enough
to
drain
but
may
be
perfect
on
a
hot
summer
day
taste
was
just
blase
bmc
likeish
doesnt
really
taste
like
they
put
more
than
2
worth
of
ingredients
in
a
barrel
size
batch
the
kind
of
beer
for
hydration
ya
know
no
hops
or
malt
to
get
in
the
way
sure
its
not
my
fave
style
but
there
are
examples
i
like
not
this
one
too
expensive
to
be
too
drinkable
d
drinkability
is
definitely
the
strong
point
here
while
a
bit
sweet
a
six
pack
is
doable
on
a
hot
summer
day
pulled
out
of
the
summer
variety
case
i
think
its
pretty
cool
that
saranac
took
on
this
classic
lager
style
when
so
many
craft
brewers
might
just
do
a
straight
up
pilsner
like
most
saranac
beers
this
lager
doesnt
have
a
great
depth
of
flavor
like
a
worldclass
brew
but
that
said
they
nailed
the
style
and
i
really
enjoy
this
beer
it
has
the
trademark
helles
toasty
bread
with
a
nice
hint
of
spicy
orange
peel
hops
i
might
say
this
is
even
on
the
hoppy
end
of
the
style
i
wish
more
breweries
made
a
good
helles
like
saranac
has
this
is
a
great
summer
beer
a
decent
brew
and
a
nice
tribute
to
the
style
from
an
american
brewer
yet
not
offerings
the
structure
i
hoped
for
drinkability
easydrinking
with
enough
flavor
to
hold
ones
interest
and
like
the
pale
pale
i
could
see
this
being
a
good
barbecue
beer
for
sure
d
well
i
slammed
this
one
down
very
easily
its
not
great
but
for
a
session
beer
if
it
were
cheap
id
drink
this
over
the
bmcs
any
day
d
while
none
of
the
saranac
beers
have
had
me
raving
the
germanstyle
lagers
are
where
they
shine
this
is
a
well
made
tasty
fresh
hellesbier
a
style
rarely
made
on
this
side
of
the
pond
the
feel
of
this
beer
is
quite
easy
drinking
it
goes
down
well
and
has
a
good
amount
of
carbonation
not
a
bad
summer
beer
an
easy
working
beer
i
havent
had
a
helles
from
any
other
brewery
but
i
generally
like
whats
happening
here
its
a
more
fruitytart
lager
thats
manageable
would
i
keep
it
around
its
doubtful
id
like
to
try
another
of
this
style
poured
from
a
brown
12
oz
bottle
has
a
pale
yellow
color
with
a
small
head
smell
is
mostly
of
malts
taste
is
crisp
malts
slightly
sweetwith
a
touch
of
bitterness
feels
light
in
the
mouth
and
has
good
drinkability
overall
this
is
a
decent
but
unremarkable
beer
comments
a
good
session
beer
for
people
who
are
bored
with
light
beers
this
beer
fall
short
of
the
munich
helles
standard
but
i
prefer
my
helles
to
be
more
like
a
maibock
than
a
standard
american
lager
one
of
the
better
saranacs
ive
had
in
retrospect
all
of
my
preferred
saranacs
are
lagersgo
figure
notes
overall
it
was
a
nice
easy
drinking
and
refreshing
beer
looked
like
a
lager
smelled
like
a
lager
tasted
like
a
lager
yep
its
a
lager
poured
a
clear
yellow
with
a
moderate
head
that
quickly
faded
to
a
collar
the
aroma
was
freshly
scythed
hay
the
taste
was
sweet
and
undistinguished
i
e
lager
the
feel
was
light
bodied
with
sufficient
carbonation
drinkability
was
very
good
pretty
decent
example
of
style
poured
into
my
pilsner
glass
pours
a
clear
bubbly
light
gold
with
a
big
white
capper
on
top
great
retention
leaves
some
spotty
lacing
smells
of
grassy
hops
sour
lemon
zest
and
some
grains
the
mouth
is
crisp
and
bubbly
but
still
smooth
flavors
of
mild
bitter
hops
fresh
greens
and
tart
fruits
on
the
finish
this
is
decent
a
great
refresher
that
went
very
well
with
my
pizza
saranac
has
done
it
again
i
have
yet
to
find
one
of
their
brews
that
i
wouldnt
have
again
the
mouthfeel
was
decent
it
was
drinkable
but
i
wouldnt
really
recommend
it
i
was
a
little
disappointed
by
this
one
the
color
is
a
good
medium
golden
the
aroma
has
some
malt
and
honey
its
got
a
good
carbonation
level
to
it
giving
it
a
crisp
mouth
feel
theres
a
bit
of
malt
sweetness
upfront
under
it
is
some
good
earth
flavors
of
straw
the
hops
in
the
end
have
a
bit
of
a
copper
flavor
to
it
some
lemon
left
on
the
tongue
for
a
helles
id
say
its
not
sweet
enough
its
more
bitter
than
sweet
but
forgetting
that
a
pretty
good
brew
good
session
drinkability
nice
crisp
refreshing
beer
that
hits
the
spot
on
a
warm
summer
day
easy
to
quaff
a
few
of
these
poured
out
clear
and
brite
color
yellow
srm4
with
a
full
white
head
supported
by
high
carbonation
aroma
has
a
moderate
amount
of
dms
that
dissipated
but
came
back
slightly
when
roused
though
dms
is
to
style
it
was
a
bit
too
much
especially
as
sample
warms
low
hop
aroma
moderate
spiciness
to
flavor
with
a
clean
malty
finish
that
dries
out
at
the
end
for
my
first
foray
into
this
style
i
enjoyed
it
wouldnt
mind
trying
other
beer
of
this
style
overall
this
one
went
down
easy
and
was
by
far
my
favorite
of
the
summer
mix
pack
nothing
earth
shattering
but
a
nice
clean
refreshing
summer
beer
for
around
the
grill
and
such
it
has
a
medium
body
but
is
overcarbonated
and
somewhat
abrasive
i
can
understand
why
saranac
packages
these
summer
beers
together
they
are
refreshing
and
very
drinkable
as
a
whole
but
they
fail
to
stand
out
individually
overall
a
very
drinkable
enjoyable
beer
enough
flavor
character
to
be
worth
your
while
without
overwhelming
they
did
right
by
releasing
this
in
the
summer
great
for
picnics
or
just
sipping
on
your
porch
if
you
like
helles
lagers
you
must
try
this
one
this
is
a
nicely
balanced
dry
easydrinking
lager
a
nice
beer
for
a
hot
day
d
very
good
i
wouldnt
mind
having
a
sixer
of
these
around
for
postlawn
mowing
the
beer
is
fairly
light
bodied
very
modestly
carbonated
with
a
sweetish
citrusy
backbone
some
herbal
grassy
notes
a
bit
of
a
spicey
hop
bite
towards
the
finish
and
a
slight
metallic
taste
in
the
mouth
afterwards
the
metallic
flavors
are
not
helping
this
beer
but
it
is
offset
a
bit
by
the
spice
in
the
finish
this
is
a
refreshing
beer
that
goes
down
easy
enough
but
nothing
to
rave
about
either
drinkability
overall
a
decent
helles
offering
not
one
of
the
best
ive
tried
but
still
a
good
offering
from
saranac
that
metal
taste
still
hurts
this
one
overall
its
like
drinking
out
of
the
high
school
water
fountain
but
its
decent
for
what
it
is
pours
a
crystal
clear
golden
color
with
a
thick
fluffy
head
that
gives
way
to
some
okay
lacing
you
can
see
a
great
amount
of
carbonation
activity
through
the
glass
the
smell
is
very
weak
with
a
hint
of
hops
in
it
the
taste
is
the
same
it
is
slight
hops
but
it
is
slightly
watery
the
mouthfeel
is
very
harsh
it
is
totally
overcarbonated
the
drinkability
is
okay
the
beer
is
watery
and
it
has
a
harsh
mouthfeel
you
wouldnt
drink
alot
of
these
d
not
a
standout
decent
beer
good
for
a
summer
day
drinkability
easy
drinking
beer
worth
a
try
came
in
the
12
days
of
summer
pack
pours
a
pale
clear
golden
yellow
with
a
vibrant
white
head
forms
tight
with
nice
lacing
following
suit
sporadic
chunky
bits
stuck
to
my
glass
aroma
has
herbal
lemon
peel
mild
citrus
efforts
with
pale
biscuit
malt
sweetness
flavor
is
crisp
assertive
american
brewed
helles
way
better
than
your
average
corn
and
rice
ridden
macro
any
day
flavor
has
some
nice
balanced
hop
bitterness
and
flavor
to
go
with
the
moderate
malt
sweetness
mouthfeel
light
bodied
classic
light
beer
carbonation
is
spritzy
and
the
finish
is
dry
drinkability
is
quality
a
sipping
beer
i
could
quaff
on
after
mowing
the
grass
and
never
look
back
and
drink
through
a
sixer
without
blinking
my
eyes
for
the
price
ill
likely
pick
up
the
variety
pack
again
can
you
blame
me
overall
quaffable
but
hardly
great
probably
the
disappointment
of
the
saranac
summer
pack
pours
a
clear
toasted
straw
color
with
a
wispy
white
head
that
quickly
settled
into
a
light
ring
the
aroma
is
very
faint
all
i
pick
up
is
some
slight
sweet
bready
malt
taste
is
similar
to
the
aroma
just
some
slight
bready
malt
i
can
taste
some
of
the
munich
malt
but
it
is
lost
in
the
watery
grainy
flavor
there
is
a
slight
grassy
hop
in
the
end
the
feel
is
light
and
water
with
fizzy
carbonation
this
is
merely
a
below
average
helles
lager
there
is
barely
any
munich
malt
presence
and
very
little
noble
hops
the
feel
is
too
light
as
well
drinkability
enjoyable
upfront
but
missing
on
the
full
picture
to
watery
to
look
for
another
one
bottle
pours
a
clear
yellow
with
a
small
white
head
and
lively
carbonation
aroma
of
sweet
fruits
and
pale
lager
malts
flavor
of
lots
of
breadywheaty
malt
with
some
light
sweetness
in
the
finish
again
a
decent
offering
from
saranac
although
certainly
on
the
boring
side
nice
golden
color
with
a
thin
white
head
little
lacing
smell
is
not
revealing
much
for
me
at
the
moment
maybe
its
my
allergies
taste
takes
off
from
the
average
beginning
with
a
sour
dough
biscuit
sense
with
malty
sweetness
held
at
bay
by
the
crisp
high
carbonation
which
is
good
in
that
sense
but
not
great
due
to
some
hidden
flavors
the
effervescence
masks
makes
this
nonetheless
very
drinakable
fine
alone
but
would
be
a
great
beer
with
spicy
foods
easy
to
drink
lager
good
representation
of
the
style
d
very
and
for
most
occasions
or
meals
drink
is
very
good
for
a
session
maybe
a
tad
on
the
sweeter
side
for
some
the
beer
pours
a
pale
gold
color
with
a
thick
frothy
white
head
that
slowly
fades
to
lacing
the
aroma
is
average
it
has
a
dry
pilsner
malt
scent
with
low
hops
and
just
a
touch
of
munich
malt
the
taste
is
decent
it
has
a
smooth
pilsnermunich
malt
flavor
along
with
a
nice
selection
of
hops
it
has
a
bolder
taste
than
the
czech
variety
the
mouthfeel
is
decent
as
well
it
is
a
medium
bodied
beer
with
good
carbonation
this
is
an
above
average
brew
but
nothing
id
have
again
a
decent
enough
brew
i
think
if
you
could
make
a
pillow
into
a
beer
this
would
be
it
d
one
of
saranacs
best
offerings
its
too
bad
that
there
were
only
two
bottles
in
the
package
pours
a
nice
golden
color
moderate
head
to
it
and
a
good
amount
of
lacing
nice
crisp
hoppy
smell
to
it
definitely
a
german
sort
of
smell
taste
has
a
medium
body
and
nice
mouthfeel
again
saaz
like
hops
sort
of
taste
to
it
quite
refreshing
i
must
say
one
of
the
better
in
their
mixed
12
pack
highly
drinkable
and
pretty
solid
taste
along
with
being
very
smooth
good
in
my
book
saranac
helles
is
a
clear
pale
golden
beer
with
a
thin
white
head
that
leaves
some
lacing
it
has
a
fruity
aroma
thats
faint
and
mellow
its
light
maybe
mediumlight
bodied
and
pretty
smooth
with
a
dry
finish
it
is
mellow
and
well
balanced
a
little
funky
with
notes
of
pretzels
and
grass
its
pretty
uneventful
saranac
12
beers
of
summer
pack
is
at
33
clear
golden
yellow
color
with
a
white
head
that
left
a
few
here
and
there
spots
of
lacing
the
aroma
is
strong
noble
hops
grassy
and
earthy
the
taste
is
filled
with
malty
sweetness
leading
up
to
a
dry
bittersweet
finish
lightmedium
bodied
with
a
crisp
refreshing
feel
that
is
highly
drinkable
for
those
of
us
who
love
a
good
barvarianstyle
beer
overall
very
light
but
easily
drinkable
and
eventually
perks
up
this
is
a
wonderful
drinking
beer
saranac
did
it
right
drinkability
is
very
good
light
crisp
flavorful
refreshing
a
great
beer
for
the
summer
also
a
great
beer
to
ease
your
friends
off
of
macroadjunct
lagers
a
nice
example
of
the
style
anyone
who
says
that
saranac
only
makes
crappy
examples
of
styles
is
dead
wrong
this
is
spoton
and
worth
a
shot
if
you
cant
enjoy
a
good
munich
helles
lager
i
feel
sorry
for
you
final
thoughts
fan
of
some
of
the
larger
european
companies
should
give
this
one
a
go
decent
representation
of
the
style
great
in
a
mix
pack
but
i
would
not
seek
this
one
out
for
itself
definitely
a
worthwhile
beverage
and
something
that
could
stand
alone
in
a
6
pack
overall
impression
a
refreshing
sessionable
lager
this
beer
deserves
more
love
well
crafted
and
enjoyable
rahr
is
such
a
good
brewery
that
delivers
every
time
i
have
something
from
them
body
is
very
light
and
drinkability
is
high
pleasant
but
more
like
a
blonde
ale
if
you
ask
me
o
probably
a
perfect
bbqsummer
beer
but
a
little
too
grainy
for
me
to
seek
out
again
if
your
only
other
options
are
the
standard
budmillercoors
offerings
drink
this
its
better
but
it
doesnt
stand
out
as
a
champion
on
its
own
o
light
crisp
lager
that
is
an
easy
substitute
for
any
of
the
bmc
lagers
not
too
much
to
the
taste
but
a
good
thirst
quencher
for
a
hot
day
pours
a
really
good
looking
golden
hue
nice
carbonationi
had
this
a
few
years
ago
and
it
really
didnt
have
as
much
carbonation
as
it
does
now
it
could
just
be
me
but
i
love
the
level
of
carbonation
it
smells
malty
with
a
hint
of
biscuits
and
grain
taste
of
sweet
malt
and
lots
of
grain
but
i
think
it
really
taste
good
not
much
in
the
way
of
hop
or
bitters
but
its
still
a
good
sip
mouth
feel
is
very
light
but
o
so
pleasant
would
love
one
of
these
sitting
at
my
favorite
fishing
hole
on
a
hot
day
overall
i
would
say
this
beer
would
be
a
great
beer
to
get
some
newbies
to
try
but
i
will
also
enjoy
a
few
of
these
the
next
time
i
cookout
with
my
friends
enjoy
my
friends
overall
a
good
effort
from
rahr
sons
and
one
i
wouldnt
turn
down
if
it
was
offered
to
me
it
doesnt
blow
you
away
but
it
is
quaffable
and
good
as
a
session
beer
this
is
a
very
simple
beer
its
too
style
but
leaves
me
wanting
something
a
little
more
flavorful
the
flavor
is
correct
and
its
good
but
its
just
not
intense
or
forward
enough
for
me
im
glad
i
tried
it
though
a
pale
beer
with
a
thin
white
head
has
a
musky
skunky
smell
a
really
dry
beer
with
a
papery
cardboard
taste
otherwise
really
plain
aftertaste
does
not
linger
too
long
so
it
is
not
unbearable
texas
has
a
lot
better
blonde
ales
to
offer
such
as
bombshell
and
firemans
4
overall
an
average
light
bodied
easy
drinking
beer
pours
a
clear
golden
color
with
a
pillowy
off
white
head
the
smell
is
mostly
biscuits
and
grain
it
is
slightly
sweet
and
buttery
it
tastes
almost
like
buttered
popcorn
with
a
touch
of
caramel
its
also
kind
of
metallic
and
grainy
this
beer
is
smooth
with
a
medium
body
and
perfect
carbonation
i
thought
this
beer
was
simple
full
flavored
and
enjoyable
not
the
best
helles
but
its
pretty
good
overall
this
beer
simply
isnt
worth
the
time
to
try
and
get
it
is
hard
enough
finding
good
beer
down
here
you
might
as
well
crack
a
budweiser
and
accept
the
hegemony
of
bmc
or
if
you
want
something
darker
go
for
the
shiner
bock
edit
as
this
beer
warms
it
does
gain
more
flavor
unfortunately
it
is
a
weird
sour
flavor
that
isnt
very
appealing
light
lacing
drinkability
a
rather
unusual
helles
with
the
sweet
fruit
and
sour
elements
adding
a
less
than
optimal
complexity
the
flavor
should
be
much
cleaner
this
helles
lager
was
im
afraid
not
good
at
all
i
really
enjoy
this
style
but
found
this
to
have
some
offflavors
that
id
normally
pass
over
as
a
bad
bottle
or
something
except
in
this
case
i
can
see
that
several
other
reviewers
have
had
the
same
experience
this
means
either
the
off
flavors
were
intentional
but
why
or
they
have
known
quality
issues
and
sell
the
beer
anyway
the
beer
pours
a
very
clear
macro
yellow
with
a
white
head
the
aroma
is
hay
grass
bready
malts
and
honey
the
flavor
is
honey
and
bread
with
the
aftertaste
being
some
dirty
earthy
hops
light
to
medium
mouthfeel
and
medium
carbonation
not
too
good
of
a
beer
next
to
try
the
black
lager
this
beer
is
nice
and
i
would
drink
it
again
drinkability
felt
good
to
drink
but
bite
might
not
be
for
all
also
could
get
tired
of
the
bite
if
drank
too
often
d
goes
down
easy
there
are
other
lagers
i
would
prefer
to
drink
but
this
one
is
okay
pours
a
very
light
clear
dark
yellow
color
body
with
a
big
head
white
lasting
vegetably
aroma
grassy
i
wish
these
smelled
more
enticing
light
taste
mostly
clean
aftertaste
carbonated
grassy
tasting
not
my
style
letting
warm
up
a
bit
a
little
better
but
still
not
my
first
choice
in
almost
any
situation
overall
kind
of
bland
a
no
frills
drink
that
would
be
good
at
a
bbq
or
party
i
will
probably
avoid
this
for
the
most
part
though
not
horrible
but
not
exactly
great
either
the
tang
in
this
could
have
used
some
more
bitterness
for
balance
and
crispness
maybe
the
hops
had
faded
some
in
this
id
be
willing
to
investigate
a
fresher
bottle
yellow
pour
on
tap
with
a
decent
white
head
hint
of
macro
skunk
in
the
aromas
fortunately
not
present
in
the
flavor
which
consists
of
a
bit
of
lemon
a
touch
of
biscuity
malt
and
bit
of
bitterness
in
the
finish
not
bad
but
nothing
to
write
home
about
light
mouthfeel
appropriate
for
the
style
an
easy
beer
to
drink
certainly
an
acceptable
summer
choice
but
not
anything
id
go
too
far
out
of
my
way
to
get
i
was
hoping
for
more
here
im
going
to
look
these
guys
up
again
when
i
visit
my
brother
and
im
sure
things
will
taste
much
better
nothing
too
memorable
and
nothing
i
would
reach
for
normally
but
for
a
free
beer
i
could
probably
drink
one
d
very
drinkable
i
wish
i
had
tried
this
brew
before
and
will
definitely
be
having
again
to
support
my
local
brewery
well
done
verdict
this
is
the
beer
that
the
macros
should
be
if
youre
looking
for
something
simple
and
drinkable
that
wont
offend
at
your
next
bbq
youll
do
a
lot
better
with
a
case
of
this
than
the
normal
budmillercoors
fare
wouldnt
ever
have
another
this
is
just
a
no
frills
lager
nothing
special
not
a
great
interpretationof
the
style
an
all
around
good
munich
helles
lager
that
is
as
good
as
weihenstephaner
if
not
better
somewhat
better
than
spaten
and
paulaner
overall
this
seems
like
an
attempt
by
rahrs
to
attract
macro
drinkers
to
their
brewery
because
it
tastes
a
lot
like
im
drinking
a
macro
d
luckliy
i
was
only
given
one
of
these
beers
i
certainly
wouldnt
wantorder
a
second
be
good
to
have
around
for
some
of
my
other
friends
to
drink
but
after
having
a
weihenstephaner
i
realize
this
beer
needs
some
work
to
help
it
be
a
good
example
of
a
munich
helles
pours
a
hazy
golden
pale
yellow
color
nice
carbonation
nice
three
finger
head
with
some
nice
sticky
lacing
left
behind
the
nose
is
malty
slight
yeast
some
slight
spice
the
taste
is
sweet
malty
some
yeast
slight
spice
medium
body
drinkable
not
too
bad
of
a
brew
d
this
is
a
pretty
easy
to
drink
beer
would
probably
be
better
in
warmer
weather
its
not
bad
theres
just
better
beers
coming
out
of
texas
than
this
one
oh
and
heres
a
big
shout
out
to
my
buddy
brewdlyhooked13
for
this
gift
beer
after
the
hot
day
i
had
it
really
hit
the
spot
cheers
d
this
beer
was
pretty
light
in
flavor
with
some
off
flavors
and
a
bit
more
malt
character
would
go
a
long
way
drinkability
i
didnt
care
much
for
this
just
too
sour
like
lemon
rind
i
was
expecting
more
of
a
malty
beer
rahr
sons
blonde
lager
is
a
pretty
good
effort
that
doesnt
stand
out
from
the
crowd
thats
exactly
how
i
felt
about
ugly
pug
black
lager
that
said
i
wouldnt
mind
having
a
brewery
like
this
set
up
shop
in
this
millstreamonly
state
thanks
mhewes
clear
very
light
yellow
with
a
horrendously
strong
skunk
smell
some
tart
sweet
malt
and
somewhat
sharp
sourness
in
the
taste
really
poorly
done
and
reminiscent
in
some
ways
to
their
oktoberfest
in
terms
of
sourness
tastes
a
bit
better
than
smell
but
not
by
much
this
is
a
poorly
made
beer
and
was
bought
fresh
just
as
their
oktoberfest
was
and
both
were
undrinkable
overall
impression
simple
drinkable
beer
nothing
too
exciting
but
its
a
nice
flavor
and
easy
to
make
a
session
out
of
it
if
i
had
to
buy
it
again
i
would
put
the
beer
back
on
the
shelf
and
buy
coors
or
miller
this
beer
is
very
unimpressive
poured
a
crystal
clear
light
straw
color
from
a
12
ounce
bottle
with
a
thin
white
head
that
dissipates
quickly
smell
is
clean
with
a
hint
of
hops
the
taste
is
very
light
slight
malt
in
the
finish
no
real
hop
bitterness
body
is
mediumlight
the
beer
goes
down
very
easily
probably
a
good
lawnmower
beer
for
the
summer
time
poured
from
a
12oz
bottle
with
no
dating
info
into
a
pint
glass
it
was
light
honey
color
with
a
bunch
of
little
yeast
bits
floating
around
it
was
a
good
pour
so
it
had
a
large
head
to
whittled
down
to
a
broken
film
light
carb
and
tiny
bit
of
lacing
the
aroma
was
soso
kinda
funky
skunked
smell
at
first
then
it
faded
to
not
much
of
anything
the
taste
was
ok
with
a
crisp
finish
im
not
a
huge
fan
of
the
style
so
it
wouldnt
get
great
marks
to
begin
with
but
this
is
middle
of
the
road
for
the
style
as
it
warms
the
flavor
starts
to
get
a
weird
tang
to
it
so
drink
cold
if
it
had
a
better
taste
it
could
almost
sneak
into
session
beer
territory
but
just
misses
overall
its
an
ok
beer
but
with
so
many
other
good
beers
out
there
i
dont
see
me
buying
another
unless
it
was
a
choice
between
macro
and
this
also
id
try
it
ontap
once
to
see
what
that
does
for
it
one
and
done
i
still
need
to
learn
more
about
the
style
before
grading
too
hard
overall
refreshing
light
refreshing
fairly
easy
to
drink
but
not
the
most
thirstquenching
beverage
much
better
than
rahrs
red
this
one
actually
tastes
like
they
know
what
theyre
doing
lovely
foamy
head
perfect
balance
of
bitterness
and
maltiness
and
a
nice
richness
in
the
aftertaste
the
aroma
isnt
all
that
great
reminds
me
of
citrus
and
wet
dog
but
the
flavor
and
balance
combined
with
the
lightish
body
but
not
watery
make
this
a
beer
i
could
easily
see
myself
drinking
34
of
while
watching
a
movie
the
yellowgold
body
of
rahrs
helles
is
just
slightly
cloudy
beneath
its
short
but
creamy
head
of
bright
white
foam
the
retention
is
average
and
lacing
is
limited
in
the
nose
its
gently
yeasty
over
a
firm
maltiness
thats
just
lightly
grainy
and
subtly
sweetish
and
backed
by
floral
and
grassy
hop
notes
the
flavor
continues
in
the
same
vein
and
its
nicely
balanced
between
gently
grainy
and
subtly
husky
malt
and
grassy
and
floral
hops
its
delicately
sweet
balanced
by
a
firm
bitterness
and
it
finishes
honeyish
with
an
edge
of
mineralish
and
grassy
hops
that
linger
shortly
on
the
palate
enjoyable
mouthfeel
is
rich
and
creamy
but
firmly
carbonated
special
although
i
have
lived
in
texas
for
a
few
years
this
is
my
first
time
to
try
this
beer
i
am
pleasantly
suprised
by
it
as
i
was
honestly
just
expecting
another
lager
this
is
a
great
session
brew
and
would
also
go
very
well
with
a
variety
of
types
of
food
this
is
a
great
beer
for
warmer
weather
very
refreshing
and
easily
drinkable
drinkability
easy
drinker
had
no
problem
putting
a
few
of
these
back
id
pick
it
if
it
was
local
last
swigs
a
refreshing
helles
with
hints
of
honey
d
a
very
good
helles
i
drink
this
when
i
want
to
eat
something
spicy
this
is
my
6
of
choice
for
summertime
bbqs
it
should
satisfy
any
level
of
beer
drinker
from
the
newbie
to
the
snob
this
is
one
i
feel
i
should
have
reviewed
by
now
and
am
liking
more
and
more
i
dont
remember
being
wowed
by
this
when
i
first
tried
it
maybe
fritz
has
tweaked
the
formula
since
then
but
its
definitely
grown
in
my
esteem
im
happy
to
have
such
a
solid
local
alternative
to
bmc
a
drinkable
brew
that
would
be
great
on
a
hot
summer
day
although
it
also
went
down
quickly
on
a
warm
spring
night
pours
out
a
straw
color
with
a
thin
white
head
and
moderate
carbonation
smells
grainy
with
a
spicy
hop
presence
flavors
start
off
with
sweetish
malts
followed
soon
by
a
hop
kick
very
grassy
and
floral
palate
washes
clean
just
a
little
too
quickly
for
my
taste
however
mouthfeel
is
a
bit
slick
and
lightbodied
with
moderate
carbonation
of
the
three
yearrounds
from
rahr
this
is
by
far
my
favorite
highly
drinkable
cheers2beers
opinion
it
may
have
sounded
like
i
was
getting
down
on
this
beer
but
it
actually
tastes
pretty
good
there
are
a
couple
things
out
of
balance
for
my
taste
but
overall
it
is
pretty
palatable
clear
bright
honey
gold
water
with
a
small
quickly
disappearing
white
head
huge
bubbles
in
dozens
of
columns
streaming
up
from
the
bottom
of
the
pint
glass
wafts
of
mild
grain
can
be
detected
but
not
much
else
in
the
nose
taste
is
crispy
malt
with
some
corn
flavors
nothing
unpleasant
refreshing
finish
the
mouthfeel
is
fine
for
the
style
thin
to
medium
with
a
fuller
feel
midway
through
this
is
an
easy
to
drink
style
and
this
brew
satisfies
12
ounce
bottle
the
color
is
a
lightly
hazed
golden
with
a
nice
level
of
carbonation
only
a
tiny
patch
of
bubbles
constitutes
this
blond
lagers
head
the
aroma
consists
of
a
mild
clean
grainy
sweetness
with
a
touch
of
herbal
hop
the
taste
consists
of
a
mildly
bready
malt
body
with
grain
flavors
becoming
a
force
towards
the
middle
of
a
sip
the
overall
sweetness
factor
is
a
little
high
but
not
out
of
control
a
touch
of
german
hops
gives
this
more
character
stylistically
speaking
this
beer
seems
like
it
fits
somewhere
between
a
very
good
allmalt
lager
and
a
helles
anyway
this
is
an
excellent
session
choice
id
rate
this
as
a
session
lager
and
one
beer
to
provide
for
guests
that
usually
partake
from
the
usual
macro
brews
this
is
a
good
way
to
get
people
to
start
drinking
locally
the
mouthfeel
is
good
drinkability
is
quite
good
id
recommend
this
one
oh
yeah
this
is
a
very
drinkable
beverage
i
would
quaff
this
beer
very
often
if
i
could
this
beer
i
think
would
work
for
beer
geeks
and
neophytes
first
of
all
it
is
tasty
with
plenty
of
subtle
complexities
imo
this
is
a
hard
style
to
get
right
and
rahr
nailed
it
texas
should
be
proud
thanks
assurbanipaul
this
beer
kicked
major
ass
recommended
pours
a
clear
golden
color
with
a
foamy
white
head
that
settles
into
a
wispy
lace
nose
is
rather
delicate
with
notes
of
sweet
malt
fresh
grain
and
floral
hops
with
some
faint
notes
of
lemon
grass
moderate
in
body
with
a
good
amount
of
active
carbonation
taste
begins
with
a
light
grain
sweetness
followed
by
some
dry
cracker
notes
and
finally
some
spicy
hops
towards
the
finish
a
very
nice
session
beer
in
fact
its
hard
to
think
of
many
superior
choices
than
this
to
help
battle
the
texas
summer
theres
one
inch
of
dense
clean
white
foam
nice
beer
is
very
clear
pure
gold
and
sports
some
racyfast
carbonation
some
smooth
small
shapes
of
lacing
the
nose
is
nice
schpooncky
saaz

a
little

saazy
peppery

full
foamy

with
a
touch

finish
is
quite
bitter
some
fantastic

nice
nutty
fresh
the
slight
harshness
of
the
finish
tames
with
temperature
overall
a
really
good
helles
love
the
grains
many
thanks
to
hardtarget
for
sharing
this
uncommon
beer
this
beer
pours
a
nice
yellow
color
with
a
2
finger
head
that
stays
nicely
over
the
beer
the
nose
is
pretty
unpleasant
lots
of
skunked
business
going
on
i
dont
like
it
the
flavor
is
very
grassey
with
a
rather
big
noble
hop
that
fades
quickly
to
more
grassey
flavors
the
feel
is
the
light
side
of
moderate
overall
the
nose
really
offends
the
flavor
is
much
better
than
the
nose
i
would
like
this
one
in
the
summer
not
bad
at
all
pours
a
medium
gold
color
with
a
proud
12
of
creamy
white
head
smell
is
of
grassy
and
grainy
malt
no
trace
of
hops
taste
is
very
grassy
stands
up
with
any
euro
lager
hops
are
in
the
background
light
and
floral
with
some
metallic
flavors
mouthfeel
is
full
and
well
carbonated
and
this
would
make
a
good
sessioning
beer
thanks
again
to
assurbanipaul
a
nice
helles
which
is
a
style
hard
to
judge
because
even
the
best
examples
have
subtle
flavors
its
not
an
exciting
or
bold
style
but
when
done
well
like
this
rahr
beer
its
very
pleasant
and
quite
drinkable
this
is
a
very
nice
session
beer
it
could
stand
more
maltiness
in
the
aroma
and
taste
maybe
a
little
too
hoppy
to
be
a
traditional
helles
but
quite
drinkable
the
aroma
is
sweet
and
malty
although
not
overpowering
at
any
level
the
real
surprise
here
is
the
taste
this
is
a
very
flavorful
beer
not
too
sweet
but
with
enough
malty
goodness
to
blend
effortlessly
with
the
faint
hops
this
is
one
that
could
become
a
session
beer
for
me
overall
impression
a
refreshing
brew
it
was
in
the
neighborhood
of
an
american
macro
lager
in
flavor
but
enough
taste
to
keep
me
interested
enjoyed
on
tap
at
the
flying
saucer
ft
worth
after
a
few
palate
wreckers
so
my
review
is
probably
a
bit
off
ill
look
forward
to
trying
a
more
mature
brew
but
a
promising
start
for
a
texas
brewery

resampled
from
bottle
ratings
upgraded
slightly
better
head
retention
white
and
frothy
cleaner
aroma
but
still
mild
very
light
and
attractive
sitting
in
a
glass
with
very
fine
carbonation
not
a
normally
a
blonde
drinker
but
like
rahrs
blonde
the
blonde
was
better
in
the
early
days
of
rahr
update
i
noticed
that
the
ontap
reviews
are
coming
in
much
higher
than
the
bottles
i
hope
to
review
the
ontap
version
soon
this
is
a
great
representation
of
the
style
maybe
one
of
the
better
helles
i
have
had
outside
of
germany
dont
care
for
much
else
they
make
but
this
one
is
very
good
id
certainly
drink
this
one
again
pleasant
and
easy
drinking
i
guess
if
youre
going
to
drink
a
blonde
this
is
better
than
some
but
i
would
drink
it
cold
and
fast
from
the
12
oz
bottle
bought
at
h
and
h
beverages
in
abilene
the
mouth
feel
is
excellent
very
crisp
with
medium
carbonation
and
little
evidence
of
bitterness
or
off
flavors
this
is
an
above
average
classic
munich
helles
lager
rahr
has
brewed
this
one
for
years
and
it
is
a
staple
at
my
somewhat
famous
backyead
bbqs
poured
into
a
pint
glass
pours
golden
with
a
large
white
head
a
finger
length
of
head
is
left
after
the
head
dissipates
a
moderate
amount
of
bubbles
can
be
seen
rising
from
the
bottom
of
the
glass
the
aroma
is
of
bready
and
grainy
and
there
is
a
mild
floral
scent
its
a
pretty
basic
but
appealing
scent
the
taste
follows
the
nose
the
malts
bring
a
nice
bready
and
grainy
flavor
to
the
beer
there
are
some
hops
in
the
background
which
help
balance
the
flavor
of
the
beer
the
body
is
light
with
adequate
carbonation
the
finish
is
crisp
and
clean
the
drinkability
is
high
this
is
an
excellent
beer
that
i
would
drink
again
another
solid
brew
from
the
rahrs
this
blonde
lager
has
a
gorgeous
deep
rich
blonde
color
and
a
nice
head
when
first
pours
but
it
quickly
dissipates
and
like
most
of
the
rahr
brews
has
an
incredibly
smooth
creamy
texture
has
very
crisp
orangelemon
back
notes
o
it
isnt
a
bad
beer
its
good
but
it
certainly
isnt
a
beer
that
stands
out
would
i
drink
it
again
yes
would
i
go
out
of
my
way
to
get
it
no
o
this
is
actually
my
first
from
rahr
i
am
a
bit
biased
in
their
favor
because
they
are
from
texas
however
i
do
think
this
was
a
great
beer
not
the
best
but
a
good
one
still
poured
out
with
a
nice
thick
white
and
fluffy
head
and
is
very
bubbly
its
body
is
a
nice
dark
golden
blonde
and
is
pretty
hazy
with
some
mild
carbonation
its
aroma
is
very
citrusy
smells
of
orange
lemon
and
peach
come
through
along
with
some
wheat
this
beer
has
some
very
good
lacing
its
light
and
semi
crisp
on
the
tongue
with
an
overall
grainy
flavor
to
it
there
are
some
tart
flavors
when
it
hits
the
corners
of
your
mouth
and
a
slight
malty
aftertaste
overall
this
beer
is
very
tasty
i
look
forwarding
to
drinking
this
one
again
