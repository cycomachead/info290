o
the
chocolate
is
well
done
but
not
sure
this
beer
meets
the
definition
of
a
quad
tasty
but
ultimately
not
satisfying
on
tap
at
a
new
joint
in
arkansas
this
is
a
straight
up
chocolate
truffle
sweet
and
chocolatey
doesnt
disappointhits
the
name
straight
on
well
done
a
quad
seriously
im
not
arguing
im
just
saying
this
tastes
nothing
like
any
other
quad
ive
encountered
and
thats
totally
fine
by
me
id
have
thought
porter
or
stout
judging
by
the
flavors
which
are
amazing
this
beer
is
a
chocolate
lovers
delight
rich
aroma
and
taste
sweet
without
being
cloying
glad
i
have
a
second
bottle
to
enjoy
later
overall
this
beer
lives
up
to
its
name
from
the
smell
to
the
taste
right
down
to
the
quad
base
flavors
combining
with
the
chocolate
to
create
a
truffle
flavor
this
beer
is
slightly
sweet
and
very
rich
overall
i
appreciated
the
effort
and
enjoy
trying
experimental
beers
from
small
breweries
thanks
again
tom
overall
a
nice
brew
but
with
the
name
i
was
expecting
more
chocolate
i
understand
that
this
beer
is
supposed
to
be
reminiscent
of
a
box
of
chocolates
but
seriously
this
is
pretty
ridiculous
its
certainly
unique
but
i
cant
say
its
exceptional
brb
insulin
shot
interesting
but
not
memorable
more
like
a
melted
candy
than
anything
else
some
hint
sof
the
belgian
influence
but
its
ultimately
a
better
version
of
choklat
o
seems
like
a
dessert
beer
and
man
it
delivers
very
nice
this
was
a
great
surprise
for
me
at
a
tasting
full
of
incredible
beers
o
like
i
said
the
chocolatiest
beer
ive
ever
had
which
as
a
result
i
have
to
give
this
beer
high
marks
very
tasty
o
this
was
crazy
chocolatey
would
drink
this
box
of
chocolates
again
a
must
try
o
i
am
a
big
fan
of
chocolate
beer
and
a
big
fan
of
quads
i
was
unsure
about
this
one
before
i
tried
it
and
now
i
think
chocolate
and
this
style
are
perfect
for
each
other
the
sweetness
lends
to
the
tame
qualities
giving
this
unique
mouthfeel
without
being
overpowering
or
hot
there
is
something
silky
about
this
beer
and
i
dig
it
there
is
a
high
drinkability
here
despite
the
style
and
i
think
that
might
be
a
bit
dangerous
i
love
this
and
will
be
cellaring
a
few
more
of
these
to
see
just
how
much
like
hersheys
syrup
this
can
get
like
this
is
the
first
beer
from
charleville
i
have
enjoyed
this
much
and
look
forward
to
more
overall
a
good
brew
tastes
like
no
quad
ive
ever
had
but
that
doesnt
take
away
from
the
experience
pours
a
dark
brown
color
much
like
a
rich
coffee
and
develops
a
very
thin
veil
of
khaki
head
little
retention
or
lacing
but
some
scattered
bubbles
persist
across
the
surface
the
aroma
is
of
dark
cherry
biter
cacao
brown
sugar
milk
chocolate
plum
date
raisin
and
other
ubiquitous
dark
fruits
a
bit
of
caramel
and
chocolate
mousse
as
well
the
flavor
is
fruitforward
in
the
beginning
highlighting
some
of
the
traditional
quad
aspects
date
raisin
a
mild
yeast
character
chocolate
caramel
brown
sugar
and
cacao
become
more
noticeable
towards
the
finish
sweet
cherry
and
candied
prune
also
come
through
mouthfeel
is
surprisingly
light
with
the
carbonation
seemingly
keeping
the
sugars
at
bay
finish
is
relatively
clean
overall
this
is
a
good
beer
that
id
be
happy
to
have
again
it
wasnt
overdone
in
any
aspect
not
to
much
or
too
little
chocolate
and
i
think
it
turned
out
nicely
this
quad
poured
out
as
a
very
dark
brown
color
there
is
a
nice
creamy
looking
head
on
top
the
retention
is
moderate
some
very
light
scattered
lacing
the
smell
of
the
beer
is
sweet
with
a
beautiful
chocolate
aroma
in
the
mix
the
taste
of
the
beer
has
some
cocoa
flavors
with
the
dark
fruits
and
bready
yeast
there
is
also
a
slight
sourness
in
there
also
that
fades
into
a
creamy
chocolate
sweetness
the
mouthfeel
of
the
beer
has
a
good
carbonation
with
a
medium
body
overall
i
thought
this
was
really
impressive
the
balance
in
the
flavor
is
really
good
the
chocolate
comes
and
goes
nicely
leaving
the
base
flavors
on
the
tongue
very
happy
i
got
to
try
this
good
looking
pour
dark
brown
body
fizzy
tan
head
aroma
is
pure
milk
chocolate
delicious
chocolates
of
all
types
inside
this
bottle
the
quad
base
turns
out
to
be
a
perfect
choice
fruity
creamy
decadent
a
terrific
creation
that
every
beer
geek
should
try
overall
this
is
a
great
spin
on
this
style
of
beer
i
really
enjoyed
the
beer
alot
i
would
love
to
revisit
this
beer
again
someday
a
unique
and
well
crafted
beer
this
brewer
has
an
adventurous
side
and
it
really
worked
well
in
this
beer
no
doubt
that
the
brewer
hit
his
mark
on
what
he
tried
to
accomplish
with
this
beer
the
beer
appears
dark
chestnut
brown
with
a
broken
head
of
tan
bubbles
the
aroma
offers
a
lot
of
chocolate
scents
along
with
a
rich
dark
roasted
malt
definitely
a
huge
chocolate
presence
not
sure
i
would
identify
this
as
a
quad
but
hey
its
good
stuff
heavy
chocolate
presence
throughout
overall
this
is
ok
but
not
something
i
would
regularly
crave
now
that
i
have
had
it
overcoming
the
anticipation
of
never
having
had
it
i
would
choose
any
of
the
standard
belgian
examples
of
the
style
over
this
bonus
points
for
chocolate
deliciousness
but
counteracted
by
lack
of
depth
and
complexity
poured
a
dark
brown
into
an
ales
of
the
revolution
tulip
glass
tiny
ring
of
tan
colored
head
quickly
fades
this
quad
smells
a
hell
of
a
lot
like
tootsie
rolls
and
cocoa
powder
taste
very
sweet
rich
chocolate
flavors
some
dark
fruits
belgian
yeast
and
boozy
underneath
this
is
one
of
the
better
chocolate
beers
ive
had
im
generally
not
a
big
fan
of
belgian
style
quads
but
the
play
on
this
is
exceptional
would
love
to
have
another
one
of
these
edit
this
beer
was
much
better
on
draft
when
sampled
at
baileys
range
in
st
louis
at
the
beginning
of
2014
overall
this
was
lousy
at
best
not
off
putting
just
mute
and
boring
the
chocolate
component
was
mute
and
the
base
quad
was
pretty
boring
itself
as
well
i
cant
believe
the
high
scores
this
one
has
received
i
can
only
hope
this
most
recent
bottling
is
over
the
hill
and
it
was
much
better
fresh
regardless
i
was
happy
to
finally
give
this
one
a
shot
so
cheers
for
all
the
hard
work
bsuedekum
best
to
steer
clear
of
this
one
at
this
point
o
overall
i
thought
this
was
an
amazing
beer
exactly
what
i
was
hoping
it
would
be
i
think
the
cloest
thing
ive
had
to
this
is
southern
tiers
choklat
which
i
also
love
definitely
not
for
everyone
but
if
you
like
very
sweet
chocolate
and
sts
choklat
youll
love
this
one
would
love
to
have
it
again
the
feel
is
a
little
thin
for
me
but
it
rolls
over
the
palate
nicely
overall
a
solid
beer
i
bet
girls
who
love
chocolate
would
absolutely
love
this
beer
bottle
at
the
may
2012
iteration
of
the
santa
cruz
tasting
series
well
this
is
really
chocolatey
mainly
tootsie
rolls
and
chocolate
syrup
but
also
a
little
like
chocolate
soda
candied
dark
fruits
make
a
minor
appearance
along
with
a
bit
of
alcohol
sharpness
delicious
in
small
servings
overall
i
definitely
enjoyed
this
beer
but
i
can
say
i
would
have
rather
split
it
with
a
friend
the
flavors
dont
change
or
develop
as
you
consume
and
in
the
end
this
is
more
of
a
gimmick
than
a
beer
to
be
honest
it
tastes
delicious
dont
get
me
wrong
but
it
will
never
be
confused
with
a
world
class
quad
all
of
the
belgian
yeast
flavors
are
completely
masked
by
the
cocoasweet
dark
caramel
maltiness
so
i
have
to
deduct
points
there
makes
for
the
perfect
after
dinner
drink
but
i
didnt
need
to
consume
a
whole
22oz
by
myself
812
would
have
sufficed
definitely
glad
i
tried
it
and
recommended
for
its
quality
and
unique
flavor
but
dont
break
your
back
to
track
it
down
thanks
to
stlthrash
for
this
one
o
excellent
taste
cool
recipe
a
bit
too
sweet
for
high
drinkability
but
its
not
supposed
to
be
a
session
beer
would
definitely
try
again
if
i
had
the
chance
smooth
feel
and
full
bodied
but
deceptively
light
considering
the
10
5
abv
overall
a
better
chocolate
beer
than
boulevards
chocolate
ale
for
a
comparable
regional
example
b
range
this
is
very
well
done
an
interesting
take
on
a
quad
with
artfully
blended
chocolate
this
is
one
ill
buy
again
to
cellar
o
this
one
did
not
disappoint
thanks
to
scoot1969
for
hooking
me
up
with
this
want
another
great
beer
experience
and
a
beer
i
would
easily
have
again
o
the
only
word
i
can
think
of
to
describe
this
is
decadence
this
was
an
absolute
treat
thanks
to
blake
bsuedekum
for
this
unbelievably
great
beer
o
while
its
listed
as
a
quad
the
chocolate
really
just
overpowers
everything
what
else
would
you
expect
from
the
name
though
the
real
standout
here
is
the
mouthfeel
its
just
the
right
amount
of
heaviness
and
sweetness
without
being
syrupy
and
cloying
its
a
joy
in
each
sip
o
an
amazing
brew
quads
are
typically
hit
and
miss
with
me
but
this
is
one
of
the
most
enjoyable
i
have
ever
tried
its
a
shame
this
is
as
limited
as
it
is
because
it
is
something
everyone
should
try
pretty
good
offering
great
desert
beer
by
the
fire
i
dig
it
but
cant
do
it
en
masse
go
charleville
overall
nice
very
drinkable
with
great
chocolate
flavors
no
super
bitter
roasty
or
estery
flavors
and
not
overpowering
cheers
nice
fresh
chocolate
finish
with
light
bitter
character
nice
comes
close
to
a
onenote
charlie
but
the
beauty
of
the
chocolate
is
that
its
not
sickeningly
sweet
allows
the
base
beer
to
surface
for
a
breath
or
two
excellent
beer
a
must
for
chocolate
lovers
what
a
wonderful
brewing
experiment
i
hope
this
becomes
a
regular
it
has
great
drinkability
d
the
flavor
and
aroma
is
nice
albeit
lacking
in
subtly
quadrupel
seems
like
an
odd
choice
for
a
base
beer
and
cant
seem
to
compete
with
the
overwhelming
chocolate
im
not
sure
id
even
know
it
was
a
quad
if
tasted
blind
like
anything
intensely
sweet
this
is
best
consumed
in
small
quantities
o
well
there
was
a
little
debate
among
the
tasting
group
about
whether
or
not
this
brew
qualifies
as
a
quad
and
none
of
us
could
pick
up
identifiable
belgian
characteristics
this
makes
reviewing
as
such
a
little
difficult
either
the
chocolate
is
masking
all
belgian
qualities
or
this
brewing
is
mislabeled
either
way
it
is
tasty
and
full
of
nice
chocolate
qualities
and
it
blurs
the
line
between
dessert
and
beer
overall
impression
id
love
to
find
out
how
they
get
the
chocolate
flavor
in
this
beer
on
my
first
sip
it
tasted
a
bit
artificial
reminding
me
of
the
chocolate
flavor
in
ofallons
cherry
chocolate
beer
but
after
a
couple
of
sips
i
started
to
enjoy
the
rich
and
complex
chocolate
and
cocoa
flavors
surprisingly
the
beer
really
lived
up
to
its
name
with
a
complex
mix
of
chocolate
flavors
that
reminded
me
of
a
box
of
chocolates
while
this
isnt
an
every
day
beer
it
is
a
great
dessert
beer
that
id
recommend
after
a
nice
meal
d
abv
pretty
well
hidden
and
i
am
a
truffle
fiend
lol
pours
a
black
color
14
inch
head
of
an
offtan
color
good
retention
and
poor
lacing
smells
of
chocolate
alcohol
liquor
sweet
malt
roasted
malt
and
a
hint
of
coffee
fits
the
style
of
a
quadruple
mouth
feel
is
sharp
and
crisp
with
an
average
carbonation
level
tastes
of
strong
sweet
chocolate
alcohol
slight
roasted
malt
and
slight
coffee
overall
the
alcohol
is
strong
in
aroma
but
well
blended
in
body
overall
this
drinks
more
like
a
chocolate
porter
certainly
not
unpleasant
but
not
worth
the
crazy
hype
big
thanks
goes
out
to
beermex2
for
sharing
this
one
during
basc
served
from
bottle
into
a
duckrabbit
snifter
poured
a
massively
dark
brown
with
a
minimal
offwhite
head
maintained
decent
lacing
throughout
the
glass
the
aroma
was
comprised
of
sweet
malt
roasted
malt
dark
chocolate
milk
chocolate
and
a
floral
note
the
flavor
was
of
sweet
malt
dark
chocolate
milk
chocolate
cream
and
subtle
roasted
malt
it
had
a
heavy
feel
on
the
palate
with
mild
carbonation
overall
this
was
an
excellent
brew
the
chocolate
notes
on
this
one
dominated
and
took
no
prisoners
i
would
not
have
guessed
that
it
was
a
quad
based
on
the
flavor
and
aroma
notes
going
on
here
at
all
it
was
really
well
put
together
and
easy
to
drink
would
have
loved
to
sit
down
to
a
whole
bottle
but
i
will
take
what
i
can
get
for
sure
o
did
not
live
up
to
the
hype
just
a
sweet
chocolate
beer
with
no
bitterness
at
all
for
a
quad
i
imagined
a
bit
of
a
thicker
and
boozier
experience
i
really
enjoyed
this
beer
and
would
gladly
drink
it
again
o
overall
i
dont
know
if
you
can
call
this
a
quad
you
can
definitely
call
it
unique
and
really
tasty
as
a
hardcore
quad
fan
i
feel
somewhat
torn
giving
it
such
high
marks
since
it
is
a
novelty
quad
but
as
a
beer
fan
who
cannot
ignore
my
taste
buds
this
is
worthy
beer
chocolate
milk
as
a
beer
who
wouldve
thunk
it
o
its
an
interesting
beer
definitely
worth
trying
and
definitely
something
a
little
bit
different
but
its
not
outstanding
by
any
means
the
chocolate
quad
could
be
very
successful
and
these
guys
are
definitely
on
the
right
track
but
i
think
you
need
a
little
stronger
of
a
base
beer
to
make
this
an
overwhelming
success
o
pretty
damn
good
i
was
expecting
it
to
be
more
towards
the
belgian
style
as
the
cocoa
dominates
but
its
still
a
tasty
beer
worthy
of
seeking
out
thanks

o
d
an
appropriately
named
beer
for
sure
not
sure
if
it
fits
the
style
aka
this
doesnt
seem
at
all
like
a
quad
but
its
tasty
overall
a
wonderful
beer
that
it
was
really
a
pleasure
to
get
ahold
of
this
beer
pours
the
murky
dark
brown
that
one
could
expect
from
most
quads
the
nose
smells
faintly
of
cocoa
powder
respectfully
of
belgian
yeast
and
theres
not
much
more
to
it
than
that
upon
sipping
holy
crap
this
thing
taste
like
chocolate
syrup
that
rich
cocoa
flavor
is
all
you
taste
and
all
you
need
to
taste
its
really
really
good
this
beer
goes
down
easy
and
i
could
sip
on
it
all
day
if
that
were
possible
overall
this
is
a
very
good
beer
and
one
that
i
highly
recommend
you
try
just
so
your
tastebuds
can
experience
the
same
shock
that
mine
did
pours
a
pretty
dark
brown
with
a
lot
of
offwhite
head
its
fairly
pretty
on
the
nose
there
is
tons
of
chocolate
milk
chocolate
which
is
a
bit
weird
but
its
pretty
decent
on
the
nose
no
real
belgian
characteristics
the
flavour
profile
is
chocolate
heavy
tons
of
milky
sweetness
well
carbonated
overall
very
interesting
and
fairly
tasty
it
might
suck
to
think
youre
getting
this
beer
in
a
trade
only
to
find
an
actual
box
of
chocolates
come
instead
then
again
tastiness
will
happen
regardless
anyway
this
stuff
pours
a
dark
murky
blackbrown
topped
by
a
finger
of
tan
foam
the
nose
comprises
cocoa
brown
sugar
cinnamon
nutmeg
light
belgian
yeast
vanilla
whipped
cream
oats
and
light
walnut
the
taste
holds
notes
of
dark
chocolate
cocoa
very
light
mint
vanilla
brown
sugar
cinnamon
very
light
roasted
malts
and
clove
this
stuff
really
lives
up
to
its
name
tastewise
though
the
chocolate
is
extremely
dominant
keeping
most
of
the
quad
characteristics
at
bay
damn
tasty
though
the
body
is
a
lightleaning
medium
with
a
very
light
moderate
carbonation
and
a
smoothish
feel
overall
a
very
nice
brew
the
only
negative
i
can
really
come
up
with
is
the
seeming
lack
of
most
of
the
quad
character
having
that
mix
with
the
chocolatiness
would
create
a
ridiculous
beer
i
think
still
this
is
some
tasty
stuff
lemme
tell
ya
o
a
very
nice
drink
though
i
perceive
this
one
to
be
more
of
a
novelty
beer
than
a
complex
sipper
flavor
profile
is
very
one
dimensional
but
it
does
come
through
with
the
chocolate
o
very
nice
very
true
to
its
name
o
decent
but
really
more
of
a
letdown
for
how
hyped
this
one
was
originally
i
can
get
past
the
fake
chocolate
and
lackluster
mouthfeel
to
really
say
it
deserves
anything
more
then
slightly
above
average
pours
a
dark
brown
thats
a
bit
watery
light
tan
head
ok
ring
the
aroma
is
outstanding
smells
like
a
trappist
quad
mixed
with
dr
pepper
and
chocolate
additional
notes
of
dark
fruits
unique
twist
on
a
quad
the
taste
is
not
as
successful
comes
across
a
bit
fake
summed
up
simply
as
chocolate
soda
a
little
too
carbonated
but
drinkable
incredibly
so
for
something
that
is
10
5
mostly
chocolate
not
up
to
the
hype
but
very
solid
overall
its
really
a
chocolate
beer
and
not
really
a
quad
the
quad
elements
are
very
muted
by
the
overdone
chocolate
flavors
overall
nice
chocolate
flavor
there
were
more
other
flavors
in
the
mix
than
i
expected
really
good
and
i
would
love
to
have
more
sampled
at
daks
memorial
day
tasting
i
think
dak
broke
this
open
pour
dark
brown
with
a
tan
head
aroma
is
all
milk
chocolate
the
flavor
follows
suit
with
sweet
chocolate
and
some
tootsie
roll
medium
bodied
with
a
slick
texture
slightly
bitter
finish
but
balanced
pretty
nice
beer
with
nice
chocolate
flavor
but
the
hype
machine
is
in
full
tilt
for
this
one
drink
so
low
bottle
count
high
buzz
nice
flavors
but
i
wasnt
blown
away
its
good
but
a
unique
take
on
a
classic
style
pours
a
murky
super
dark
brown
with
a
1
inch
beige
head
that
fades
to
an
oily
cap
no
lacing
with
this
beer
smells
of
chocolate
covered
dark
fruits
raisins
chocolate
syrup
and
chocolate
taffy
taste
is
pretty
much
the
same
with
dark
fruits
in
chocolate
chocolate
syrup
and
cocoa
powder
the
chocolate
smells
and
tastes
are
a
bit
fake
smelling
for
the
most
part
even
though
the
bottle
says
brewed
with
natural
chocolate
flavor
not
too
impressed
with
that
aspect
of
the
beer
mouthfeel
is
a
bit
thin
with
a
decent
level
of
carbonation
overall
this
is
fairly
good
but
not
as
great
as
i
was
expecting
it
to
be
based
on
the
hype
however
i
know
there
was
a
low
bottle
count
on
this
one
so
i
feel
lucky
that
i
got
to
try
it
this
is
a
damn
good
beer
it
seems
to
be
built
on
a
nice
rich
and
study
base
quad
id
like
to
try
the
base
beer
as
well
box
of
chocolates
is
a
dense
rich
sipper
for
the
chocolate
lover
cheers
thanks
to
birchstick
for
this
bottle
pours
out
the
darkest
quad
ive
ever
seen
dark
brown
almost
black
small
head
that
was
gone
in
a
flash
and
no
lacing
looks
lifeless
after
a
minute
or
two
big
wafts
of
chocolate
mostly
of
the
tootsie
roll
variety
with
just
a
small
touch
of
quad
characteristics
in
the
background
notably
dark
fruits
and
maybe
some
cherry
smells
great
as
this
thing
is
basically
all
chocolate
taste
is
pretty
damn
similar
to
the
nose
all
chocolate
im
losing
the
belgian
characteristics
here
as
theres
not
much
of
the
yeast
coming
into
play
again
the
tootsie
roll
qualities
come
out
once
again
with
just
underlyng
of
dark
fruitraisin
and
a
touch
of
caramel
alcohol
isnt
noticeable
at
first
put
comes
out
and
is
slighly
hot
when
the
beer
warms
creates
some
nice
chocolaty
belches
good
mediumfull
body
lighter
carbonation
a
very
nice
chocolate
beer
it
really
dominates
everything
so
if
yours
is
the
sweet
tooth
and
the
cocoa
bean
is
your
dark
master
a
la
george
costanza
youll
love
this
as
much
as
your
bosco
black
with
a
dark
brown
head
with
excellent
retention
and
nice
lacing
this
is
a
gorgeous
quad
the
nose
smelly
like
hersheys
chocolate
syrup
with
some
milk
chocolate
added
belgian
yeast
character
is
present
mildly
at
that
with
a
little
bit
of
spice
apart
from
that
i
smell
chocolate
chocolate
and
some
chocolate
the
palate
opens
thin
and
chocolatey
while
paradoxically
tasting
rather
syrupy
at
the
same
time
not
very
complex
theres
chocolate
and
tootsie
roll
here
sweet
this
beer
is
light
in
body
and
has
a
noticeable
caramel
character
not
much
yeast
expression
on
the
palate
either
not
very
complex
but
moderately
delicious
in
small
quantities
this
beer
is
sweet
like
milk
chocolate
but
has
that
artificial
chocolate
flavor
all
over
it
i
dont
know
if
it
is
artificial
chocolate
or
not
but
it
tastes
like
milk
chocolate
and
a
tootsie
roll
the
entire
time
it
has
a
wet
finish
and
no
aftertaste
at
least
it
is
super
sweet
and
not
my
favorite
i
was
expecting
a
better
integration
of
fine
chocolate
with
the
dark
caramelized
fruit
flavors
of
a
belgian
style
quad
the
concept
seemed
really
interesting
and
i
imagined
it
much
differently
instead
this
is
like
a
sweet
chocolate
bomb
from
the
lost
recipe
vault
of
southern
tier
o
overall
a
very
good
beer
taste
is
excellent
smell
is
very
good
with
the
one
downfall
being
the
mouthfeel
an
interesting
beer
for
sure
and
im
glad
to
have
tried
it
overall
this
was
a
pretty
big
disappointment
im
stunned
at
the
reviews
its
gotten
so
far
this
beer
is
quite
simply
not
good
it
is
really
hard
to
find
a
good
chocolate
beer
in
my
opinion
this
one
is
not
too
bitter
or
too
sweet
i
really
appreciate
the
fact
that
they
consulted
a
chocolateer
while
developing
this
beer
it
has
a
great
nose
and
look
when
poored
i
was
also
fortunate
enough
to
try
it
on
draft
at
the
st
louis
microfest
last
weekend
and
enjoyed
it
even
more
on
tap
i
highly
recommend
this
beer
to
anyone
looking
for
a
chocolate
beer
unlike
most
others
d
drinkability
is
moderately
high
very
unique
offering
from
a
relatively
unknown
brewery
that
gives
a
traditional
style
a
modern
twist
its
not
bad
at
all
but
not
lifechanging
either
if
typical
quads
have
you
in
a
rut
seek
this
out
and
live
a
little
o
great
beer
we
have
here
would
easily
drink
this
again
if
we
had
one
it
would
be
open
big
thanks
to
tyler
for
hooking
this
beer
up
overall
this
is
at
the
top
for
me
when
it
comes
to
quads
for
sure
i
would
love
to
score
this
one
again
very
drinkable
and
enjoyable
its
a
nice
change
of
pace
from
all
the
imperial
stouts
and
ipas
that
i
drink
look
forward
to
it
again
the
beer
pours
a
dark
brown
color
with
a
tan
head
the
aroma
is
full
of
chocolate
dark
fruit
and
roasted
malt
the
chocolate
is
nearly
overwhelming
and
really
melds
well
with
the
dark
fruit
notes
from
the
quadrupel
the
flavor
is
more
of
the
same
the
chocolate
tastes
like
malted
milk
balls
with
some
roasted
malt
and
a
little
bit
of
raisins
and
figs
mixed
in
thick
mouthfeel
and
medium
mouthfeel
definitely
a
chocolateheavy
beer
that
somewhat
surprisingly
mixed
well
well
with
a
traditional
belgian
quad
overall
its
pretty
damn
fine
stuff
great
stuff
from
charleville
a
brewery
with
a
bright
future
no
doubt
overall
i
dont
know
whether
this
is
one
of
the
best
american
quads
i
have
had
or
if
it
is
nothing
more
than
a
solid
attempt
my
thoughts
changed
with
every
sip
hmmm
d
interesting
take
on
a
quad
the
name
box
of
chocolate
is
very
appropriate
for
this
beer
as
chocolate
is
the
main
theme
with
the
quad
characteristics
playing
more
of
a
supporting
role
i
was
expecting
it
to
be
the
other
way
around
really
good
stuff
from
charleville
meets
the
hype
imo
although
if
youre
not
a
quad
fan
then
i
dont
imagine
this
one
will
suddenly
make
you
a
believer
its
merely
a
very
nice
wellmade
cocoainfused
twist
on
the
style
this
is
a
fantastic
beer
and
i
really
like
what
the
chocolate
brings
to
the
table
one
of
the
most
unique
quads
ive
ever
had
o
a
bit
hard
to
drink
through
a
whole
bomber
so
more
of
a
dessert
beer
but
a
great
dessert
beer
at
that
hope
they
brew
this
one
again
o
really
good
its
just
so
tempting
to
down
it
really
a
delicious
beverage
and
one
that
im
really
glad
to
have
tried
i
was
debating
on
saving
it
to
get
some
age
on
it
but
i
wonder
if
that
will
effect
the
chocolate
nevertheless
a
really
good
beer
and
worth
seeking
out
pours
a
medium
brown
with
short
offwhite
head
that
sticks
around
for
a
bit
before
falling
to
a
thin
collar
not
too
much
lacing
the
nose
is
fairly
light
with
some
nice
notes
of
chocolate
and
a
bit
of
dark
fruits
in
the
background
very
nice
the
taste
really
explodes
off
of
the
base
the
nose
had
going
its
just
as
described
a
very
nice
quad
with
layers
of
chocolate
over
the
top
the
chocolate
character
is
really
dominant
and
the
quad
underneath
is
spot
on
as
well
nice
mix
of
dark
fruits
raisins
and
semisweet
malt
a
bit
of
brown
sugar
as
well
mouthfeel
is
very
very
smooth
and
doesnt
reveal
the
10
5
at
all
overall
a
very
solid
beer
and
its
acclaim
is
welldeserved
o
i
am
glad
that
i
picked
this
one
up
and
that
i
have
a
couple
of
additional
bottles
to
drink
i
dont
think
that
they
are
going
to
last
long
this
is
a
really
good
beer
although
some
might
find
the
chocolate
too
one
dimensional
given
what
they
were
looking
to
do
this
one
is
exceptional
go
get
this
one
you
will
enjoy
it
the
body
is
medium
to
mediumheavy
with
a
light
carbonation
that
softens
the
consistency
a
bit
and
makes
this
a
delight
on
the
palate
a
very
solid
offering
and
i
am
surprised
that
this
has
flown
under
the
radar
as
much
as
it
has
to
this
point
get
your
hands
on
some
it
will
be
worth
it
m
this
is
hard
to
rate
on
one
hand
its
drinkabilitythis
is
a
fantastic
spin
on
a
belgian
quad
the
chocolate
could
easily
overwhelm
a
beer
like
this
but
the
backbone
of
the
beer
still
makes
itself
known
overall
this
was
an
absolute
treat
to
drink
fantastic
flavors
and
the
beer
is
everything
charleville
said
it
would
be
with
the
superb
taste
rotating
production
and
low
600
bottle
production
i
expect
this
under
the
radar
beer
to
start
drawing
some
attention
this
was
a
nice
take
on
the
belgian
quad
smooth
and
easy
to
drink
but
too
chocolatey
to
have
more
than
one
i
would
suggest
looking
for
this
beer
both
on
tap
and
in
a
small
release
of
bottles
something
magical
going
in
in
this
glass
right
now
drinkable
quad
but
not
terribly
complex
compared
to
other
instances
of
the
style
feels
somewhat
shallow
overall
im
uncertain
if
perhaps
i
got
hold
of
a
bad
bottle
or
if
ive
been
spoiled
by
other
large
abv
beers
that
conceal
their
payload
but
this
would
not
be
a
repeater
for
me
i
am
generally
a
fan
of
sweeter
beers
but
the
heat
and
medicinal
tinge
taint
the
whole
flavor
profile
for
me
smell
of
cherries
and
coffee
has
a
mango
juice
type
of
taste
and
feel
very
nice
belgian
solid
offering
from
dieu
du
ciel
would
have
again
worth
trying
if
you
come
across
it
4
29
monks
pub
chicago
draft
this
is
my
first
quadruple
and
first
dieu
de
ciel
offering
and
it
is
one
of
my
favorite
beers
of
all
time
i
went
from
trying
something
new
to
enjoying
four
pours
of
an
amazing
beer
very
strong
smell
of
coffee
and
fruity
the
taste
however
is
very
strong
malty
beer
the
beer
feels
heavy
great
in
the
mouth
and
goes
down
smooth
rigor
mortis
definitely
a
beer
to
die
for
and
highly
recommended
from
this
beer
lover
cheers
will
try
again
in

was
not

to

good
as
it
was

overall
impression
of

is
of
a
true
to

quadrupel
that
fits
the
richer
abbey
style
rather
than
the
drier
trappist
form
more
st

than
achel
extra
very
nice
overall
this
is
a
nice
quadrupel
it
is
rich
and
complex
in
aroma
and
flavor
hitting
the
style
quite
well
and
it
has
a
lovely
full
mouthfeel
that
is
pleasant
and
aids
the
flavor
a
very
nice
quadrupel
and
i
am
looking
forward
to
seeing
how
it
ages
drinkability
easily
the
best
brown
ale
ive
had
more
akin
to
a
great
quadruple
definitely
one
to
stock
up
on
in
preparation
for
the
winter
delicious
overall
a
pretty
good
quad
though
the
spiciness
and
alcohol
heat
detract
a
little
bit
not
as
complex
as
id
hoped
o
just
a
delicious
quad
interesting
and
with

great

not
sure
what
the
abt
stands
for
aroma
of
caramel
pours
cloudy
brown
with
minimal
head
heavy
sweet

full

with
slightly
sticky

average

overall
a
nice
strong
beer
if
a
bit
on
the
sweet
side
a
great
representation
with
big
flavors
but
still
mellow
and
enjoyable
although
totally
lacking
a
head
and
lacing
and
being
only
medium
brown
in
other
characteristics
this
resembles
a
quad
the
alcohol
while
not
noticeable
in
the
flavor
makes
itself
evident
in
the
following
stomach
burn
pretty
weak
overall
this
may
be
a
good
gateway
beer
for
someone
afraid
of
quads
o
good
but
not
great
a
stellar
beer
hopefully
for
a
stellar
game
tonight
go
habs
definitely
worth
picking
up
its
a
rich
malty
beer
with
a
winelike
character
along
with
some
fruit
and
spice
character
11
5oz
bottle
bought
this
a
couple
of
weeks
ago
but
it
appears
from
the
label
this
may
have
been
made
in
2010
4
years
ago
it
pours
an
opaque
brown
color
there
was
a
very
small
off
white
head
that
didnt
linger
long
or
leave
much
lacing
the
aroma
is
good
i
get
a
little
tartness
possible
brett
on
top
perhaps
some
cherry
banana
yeastiness
raisin
caramel
and
others
seems
like
every
time
you
take
a
whiff
you
pick
up
something
else
the
taste
is
good
i
was
afraid
that
it
might
be
bad
from
a
whiff
of
brett
in
the
aroma
but
it
is
not
the
case
a
very
complex
taste
very
full
bodied
lots
of
malts
but
only
a
subdued
sweetness
caramel
bready
chocolate
some
spices
and
fruits
in
the
background
complex
and
nice
no
hint
of
the
alcohol
i
would
definitely
buy
it
again
another
good
entry

wonderful
drinking
beer
that

is
suggestive
of
a
low
hopped
barley
wine
would
be
terrific
with
a
rich
chocolate
torte
and
a
warm
fireplace
enjoyed
slowly
o
somewhat
underwhelming
given
previous
experience
with
du
ciel
good
but
a
little
punchy
up
front
and
not
a
lot
of
follow
through
bottle
says
best
after
laying
down
for
6
months
probably
true
this
is
one
of
the
sweeter
quads
ive
tasted
its
also
sufficiently
complex
and
full
good
but
not
quite
in
that
echelon
of
great
quads
a
solid
big
belgian
beer
fairly
easy
to
drink
but
when
youre
reaching
for
a
quad
youre
usually
in
the
mood
for
something
with
layered
complexity
which
is
lacking
in
this
brew
overall
this
is
a
very
nice
beer
with
3
years
on
it
not
sure
how
it
is
fresh
but
definitely
try
this
with
some
age
on
it
a
well
balanced
quad
with
very
complex
layered
taste
more
hops
that
most
quads
another
well
made
brew
from
dieu
du
ciel
while
its
far
from
my
favorite
this
is
enjoyable
i
actually
like
the
grape
jelly
aspect
worth
a
go
for
fans
if
the
style
or
the
brewery
a
restrained
version
of
the
style
its
smoother
and
gentler
than
you
get
from
most
beers
in
this
category
a
nice
change
of
pace
or
a
great
way
to
introduce
someone
to
a
darker
belgian
style
beer
im
glad
i
let
this
sit
for
a
bit
so
i
could
give
it
a
chance
theres
some
wonderful
flavors
in
here
and
other
than
its
unfortunate
thinness
this
is
an
excellent
take
on
a
style
that
does
indeed
require
a
complexity
of
flavors
all
balanced
out
the
way
this
is
given
the
hidden
abv
ill
be
sipping
this
one
all
night
but
theres
nothing
necessarily
wrong
with
that
not
the
strongest
ive
had
from
this
brewery
but
still
an
undeniable
good
offering
well
the
beer
looks
okay
and
tastes
okay
but
its
difficult
to
get
really
fired
up
about
this
one
oh
it
has
its
maltlike
presence
and
definitely
exudes
its
big
booze
character
without
getting
out
of
hand
but
nothing
quite
gels
to
make
this
one
stand
out
full
bodied
and
rich
from
the
first
sip
overall
an
excellent
beer
o
very
drinkable
one
more
great
beer
from
dieu
du
ciel
overall
a
good
beer
nothing
stands
out
as
amazing
but
a
solid
quad
with
some
interesting
spices
and
that
ddc
house
flavour
which
is
not
a
bad
thing
poured
into
a
chimay
chalice
the
beer
pours
cloudy
toffee
brown
with
a
thin
offwhite
head
that
doesnt
last
very
long
there
are
some
visible
tiny
bubbles
along
the
side
of
the
glass
and
alcohol
legs
the
beer
smells
of
bread
toffee
and
chocolate
i
get
an
aroma
of
dark
fruits
as
well
the
taste
follows
the
nose
the
beer
has
a
nice
bready
flavor
as
well
as
some
toffee
that
brings
some
sweetness
to
the
flavor
i
get
some
light
flavor
of
raisin
and
some
hop
bitterness
that
mildly
lingers
on
the
back
end
i
also
taste
the
alcohol
the
beer
is
full
bodied
with
moderate
carbonation
the
finish
is
slightly
dry
this
is
a
very
good
beer
o
this
is
really
really
good
sweet
aged
fruit
complex
flavors
mouth
is
rochefortlike
do
wish
there
was
a
stronger
nose
flavors
are
really
nice
but
slightly
mellow
10
5abv
is
hidden
so
well
one
of
the
best
nontrappist
quads
ive
ever
had
o
ddc
says
this
is
ideal
with
at
least
6
months
of
age
on
it
so
consider
this
a
fresh
review
i
would
say
this
is
a
quite
nice
quad
for
a
beer
out
of
belgium
nice
flavours
interesting
yeast
profile
just
not
quite
as
refined
as
the
400
year
old
belgiums
p
overall
not
the
most
complex
perhaps
a
bit
sweet
but
still
worth
snagging
if
you
happen
to
feel
like
a
triple
during
its
once
a
year
release
or
ones
kicking
around
in
your
basement
poured
a
thick
almost
brownish
body
with
minimal
head
on
top
of
a
heavy
aroma
that
seemed
to
have
some
sugary
malts
along
with
touches
of
dark
and
tropical
fruits
as
well
as
the
typcial
orangecitrusy
yeast
strain
i
find
in
these
beers
as
well
as
a
touch
of
medicalnessbooze
beer
is
more
of
the
same
as
it
is
thick
and
full
and
definitely
a
sipper
a
very
good
beer
i
just
found
for
me
at
least
while
there
are
strong
notes
of
sweetness
and
breadiness
yeastiness
that
make
it
sweet
and
go
down
easy
and
balance
the
hops
and
something
akin
to
dark
fruits
like
cherries
or
figs
the
abv
gets
into
the
beer
a
little
and
as
my
b
eer
warmed
the
alcohol
took
over
and
somewhat
muted
the
rest
of
the
beers
flavor
profile
a
nice
beer
and
i
would
recommend
it
but
just
not
my
favorite
of
style
drinkability
its
a
very
smooth
drinkable
beer
accompanied
with
good
flavors
and
aromas
overall
a
really
nice
beer
balanced
strong
delicious
enjoyable
and
well
made
slightly
all
over
the
board
dont
get
me
wrong
its
good
just
not
great
at
512oz
its
a
good
value
and
should
be
considered
a
try
cheers
cant
wait
to
see
how
it
cellars
verdict
a
decent
quad
from
dieu
du
ciel
while
it
isnt
as
refined
as
many
others
and
the
alcohol
takes
over
at
times
it
is
definitely
an
enjoyable
beer
but
im
not
sure
id
buy
this
again
with
rochefort
10
and
st
bernardus
12
so
readily
available
overall
a
nice
example
of
a
belgian
definitely
worth
a
try
o
great
well
rounded
brown
may
i
have
another
the
taste
is
powerful
with
a
notable
barley
malt
sweetness
up
front
followed
by
molasses
and
black
licorice
and
completing
its
evolution
with
a
moderate
to
high
bitterness
that
reminds
you
what
it
was
you
just
drank
this
is
also
something
that
would
cellar
quite
well
decent
nothing
super
exciting
probably
wouldnt
buy
again
at
its
price
point
do
overlysweet
and
bready
it
wore
on
me
as
time
wore
on
its
not
a
terrible
beer
id
have
another
if
it
was
handed
to
me
but
i
wont
seek
it
out
again
m
very
little
heat
wellbalanced
drinkable
and
true
to
type
very
smooth
o
not
a
bad
quad
just
fairly
simply
and
quite
boozy
despite
this
bottle
being
at
least
a
year
or
two
old
tastes
more
like
a
belgian
brown
ale
than
a
quad
to
be
honest
as
well
overall
a
decent
quad
but
nothing
crazy
flavor
was
there
but
it
could
have
been
bolder
especially
initially
a
quality
beer
worth
checking
out
if
you
get
the
chance
but
nothing
worth
jumping
through
hoops
for
especially
if
you
have
access
to
the
belgian
examples
of
the
style
rigor
mortis
is
definitely
a
good
quad
which
doesnt
often
come
out
of
other
countries
besides
belgium
imo
this
one
is
on
the
edge
of
alcoholphenol
levels
but
it
doesnt
take
over
and
ruin
the
beer
big
yeast
character
paying
5
a
bottle
for
this
hurts
wouldnt
pay
5
for
a
6
pack
of
it
in
the
future
i
poured
the
beer
into
a
chalice
it
has
a
nice
auburn
like
color
the
head
is
cream
colored
i
can
smell
cherries
but
nothing
else
and
even
that
is
faint
my
weak
sense
of
smell
i
can
taste
cherry
and
a
fruitiness
theres
also
a
sweetness
to
the
beer
i
can
taste
a
roasty
finish
with
some
alcohol
burn
theres
a
cloying
aftertaste
that
im
not
impressed
with
0
a
reasonable
quaddark
belgium
ale
which
goes
down
well
on
a
winters
night
not
the
best
quad
going
around
but
definitely
worth
a
try
definitely
one
of
the
best
beers
dieu
du
ciel
has
on
offer
perfect
as
we
come
into
the
fall
season
a
very
pleasant
beer
that
needs
to
be
tried
overall
pretty

not
fantastic
pours
a

this

i
taste
is
that
on
purpose
or
did
i
buy
a
bottle
thats
just
a
little
contaminated
who
knows
but
the
result
is
good
o
to
categorize
this
as
a
quad
may
be
a
bit
misleading
it
is
most
certainly
a
belgian
style
brown
ale
as
described
on
the
bottle
that
being
said
it
wasnt
bad
but
it
wasnt
great
either
just
a
slightly
above
average
dark
belgian
ale
a
tasty
example
of
the
style
with
plenty
to
offer
the
senses
and
style
appropriate
this
is
a
very
interesting
beer
starting
off
as
a
malty
sweet
quad
but
kind
of
turning
into
more
of
a
barleywine
when
it
gets
to
room
temperature
pours
slightly
hazy
dark
raisin
colored
with
a
one
inch
tan
head
smells
like
dark
and
red
malts
belgian
yeast
wood
dried
cherries
and
caramel
flavor
isnt
sweet
at
all
really
more
of
a
malt
driven
beer
although
the
yeast
adds
some
very
unique
undertones
of
spice
hard
to
describe
not
fruity
not
sweet
different
for
a
quad
when
it
warms
it
becomes
a
totally
different
beer
hops
becomes
a
dominant
flavor
in
the
finish
and
the
alcohol
really
comes
out
as
the
carbonation
totally
dies
major
transformation
from
the
almost
refreshing
first
sip
mouthfeel
is
pretty
solid
fuller
bodied
with
fairly
standard
carbonation
overall
a
nice
beer
but
for
the
price
i
might
skip
it
next
time
originally
reviewed
12272010
mouthfeel
is
full
bodied
warming
and
semi
dry
with
nutmeg
conclusion
you
can
tell
it
has
those
brown
ale
notes
it
is
called
a
quadruple
by
rate
beer
and
beer
advocate
but
on
the
label
it
is
in
fact
labelled
as
an
extra
strong
abbey
brown
ale
which
i
believe
to
be
a
much
better
description
cause
the
flavor
profile
is
not
exactly
quadruple
and
neither
is
the
color
it
is
verging
somewhere
between
extra
strong
brown
ale
as
labeled
and
barley
wine
with
some
very
light
notes
of
quadruplestrong
dark
ale
as
it
has
notes
of
every
groups
typical
type
this
is
delicious
going
to
buy
some
more
for
sure
wow
these
flavors
really
do
change
quickly
shifting
between
all
three
styles
ho
boy
this
is
as
fine
an
abbot
as
youll
find
poured
at
a
great
temperature
with
a
small
to
medium
sized
tan
head
that
soon
settled
to
a
light

im
unimpressed
with
this

brew
overall
enjoyable
quad
by

despite
the
creepy
corpse
image
on
the
bottle
the
flavours
in
this
brew
are
quite
warm
and
inviting
abv
is
noticeable
making
this
more
of
a
sipper
a
nice
addition
to
dieu
du

lineup
not
for
the
faint
of
heart
o
i
expect
the
best
from
dieu
du

but
this
bottle
didnt
quite
deliver
mediocre
quad
pretty
okay
abbey
ale
good
beer
recommended
if
you
dont
have
to
pay
through
the
nose
for
it
probably
wont
have
again
b
to
c
o
another
great
dieu

i
wouldnt
necessarily
drink
more
than
one
of
these
in
a
night
but
it
is
a
nice
culminating
point
i
definitely
would
recommend
trying
i
would
look
forward
to
aging
a
bottle
to
see
how
it
evolves
a
good
representation
of
the
style
in
my
opinion
d
decent

not
much

makes
it

on
the

medium
carbonation

with
a

drinkability
is
limited
due
to
some
booziness
but
it
is
a
pretty
nice
sipper
alcohol
is
noticeable
but
not
too
bad
overall
this
is
a
pretty
nice
quadrupel
some
good
flavor
complexity
and
balance
if
it
was
a
bit
less
boozy
i
probably
would
have
liked
it
more
drinkability
and
overall
impression
this
is
a
reasonably
good
beer
that
goes
down
relatively
easily
my
overall
impression
is
that
it
is
well
made
but
does
not
quite
hit
the
mark
for
me
it
seems
a
bit
rough
around
the
edges
and
a
bit
lacking
in
complexity
for
a
bdsa
perhaps
it
needs
a
bit
more
time
in
the
cellar
this
is
a
full
bodied
brew
that
is
creamy
and
full
in
the
feel
it
has
a
moderate
amount
of
carbonation
and
overall
is
a
very
well
put
together
take
on
the
style
this
initial
reaction
to
this
brew
based
soley
on
the
aroma
is
wow
this
is
going
to
be
a
sickeningly
sweet
mess
but
after
the
first
sip
you
are
pleasantly
caught
off
guard
well
done
i
have
no
have
many
offerings
from
dieu
du
ceil
but
the
ones
i
have
had
were
quite
enjoyable
certainly
worth
a
try
m
full
bodied
not
too
thin
but
not
syrupy
either
great
carbonation
level
a
bit
sticky
on
the
sides
of
your
mouth
im
still
not
totally
sure
about
how
a
quad
is
all
that
different
from
a
belgian
strong
dark
but
this
was
really
tasty
overall
a
pretty
good
quad
but
not
as
good
as
the
best
ones
out
there
o
this
is
a
beer
that
ive
tried
a
long
time
ago
and
that
i
enjoyed
quite
a
bit
the
second
time
ive
tried
it
i
really
like
the
beer
but
it
has
some
things
in
there
that
i
dont
like
it
does
not
have
a
good
look
to
it
but
i
wont
hold
that
against
the
beer
the
smell
is
good
but
not
overwhelming
or
overpowering
the
taste
is
where
this
beer
is
at
i
would
drink
this
beer
and
enjoy
it
without
worrying
about
what
its
score
is
but
i
dont
think
its
an
elite
level
with
everything
perfect
about
it
and
honestly
i
am
perfectly
okay
drinking
a
really
good
not
perfect
beer
pours
a
reddish

some
mild
retention
nose
is
lightly
grapey
some

a
bit
of
nondescript
stinkiness
and
some
extremely
subtle
spicing
taste
has
some
light
dark
fruits
lots
of
spicing
that
lingers
in
the
finish
a
bit
of

has
a
low
carbonation
mediumfull
feel
and
some
decent
sweetness
a
modest

heat
on
the
backend
a
decent
quad
overall
i
would
most
likely
not
buy
this
beer
again
i
really
like
quads
but
this
one
while
average
overall
this
is
not
one
i
would
go
looking
for
considering
the
great
number
of
excellent
quads
to
be
had
pours
a
murky
brown
with
a
light
ring
of
off
white
head
no
lace
to
speak
of
i
had
to
give
this
a
hard
swirl
to
get
some

this
was
pretty

i
really
had
to
warm
up
to
it
starts
out
a
little
weak
but
halfway
through
i
was
sold
abv
hidden
well
good
overall
overall
a
decent
easy
drinking
quad
but
nothing
superlative
d
very
drinkable
the
caramel
malts
and
candi
sugar
provide
a
nice
rich
and
sweet
base
to
the
beer
with
the
fruitness
and
yeasts
providing
some
additional
flavors
overall
im
really
impressed
by
this
beer
however
for
the
price
you
can
easily
get
a
st
b
abt
12
overall
a
quiet
giant
that
is
tasty
and
goes
down
easy

belgian
yeast
brown
sugar
toffee
a
hint
of
cocoa
powder
and
a
hint
of
hop
bite
on
the
finish
alongside
some
roasted
malt
great
take
on
the
style
o
i
havent
bought
a
bottle
of
say
bernardus
12
at
a
bottle
shop
lately
so
i
cant
compare
the
price
this
was
6
bucks
for
me
and
frankly
worth
it
its
a
really
great
beer
very
much
to
style
and
very
much
tasty
overall
not
the
best
quad
ive
had
but
an
usual
take
on
a
brown
alequad
combo
this
is
an
interesting
beer
and
i
can
certainly
enjoy
it
its
a
solid
offering
from
a
brewery
which
creates
quite
a
few
very
good
beers
overall
the
flavors
in
this
beer
are
excellent
and
set
at
just
about
the
maximum
level
possible
if
it
werent
for
the
alcohol
taste
this
would
be
an
incredible
beverage
even
with
it
though
it
still
ranks
high
on
my
scale
recommended
o
interesting
marriage
here
can
definite
isolate
the
nut
brown
characteristics
from
the
quad
ones
not
much
to
say
about
this
beer
its
good
but
there
doesnt
seem
to
be
much
that
is
making
it
stick
out
from
other
quads
aside
from
its
awesome
label
d
at
over
2
years
this
still
has
the
same
alcohol
bite
that
fresh
rochefort
10
does
i
dont
anticipate
it
smoothing
out
much
more
without
losing
depth
of
flavor
as
well
the
first
68oz
went
down
relatively
easily
but
the
mounting
buzz
and
unpleasant
alcohol
made
the
last
few
ounces
a
chore
not
dieu
du
ciels
finest
offering
but
a
fairly
solid
quad
to
be
fair
they
warn
you
that
it
needs
at
least
6
months
on
the
bottle
and
release
it
in
april
so
that
its
in
prime
shape
for
the
winter
a
nice
example
of
the
style
very
enjoyable
and
absolutely
well
made
overall
pretty
good
for
a
nonbelgian
quad
pours
a
murky
iced
tea
color
with
a
1
inch
brown
head
that
fades
to
an
oily
film
on
the
top
of
the
beer
random
patches
of
lace
form
on
the
glass
on
the
drink
down
there
is
some
sediment
floating
around
in
the
beer
after
the
pour
smell
is
of
dark
fruits
raisinsplums
spices
and
belgian
yeast
taste
is
exactly
like
the
smell
with
the
dark
fruit
and
spices
being
most
prominent
a
lower
level
of
carbonation
makes
for
a
smooth
and
somewhat
creamy
mouthfeel
on
this
beer
overall
this
is
a
pretty
good
quad
that
i
am
glad
i
picked
up
this
beer
poured
out
as
a
murky
dark
brown
color
the
head
was
slim
and
didnt
leave
much
lacing
behind
the
smell
of
the
beer
has
some
fermented
dark
fruits
on
the
nose
a
little
bit
of
yeast
and
not
too
much
else
here
the
taste
of
brown
sugar
and
fruit
upfront
with
a
nice
sweetness
to
it
the
aftertaste
had
a
dry
caramel
like
flavor
the
mouthfeel
was
medium
bodied
and
lightly
carbonated
overall
i
enjoyed
this
quad
i
would
still
prefer
a
la
trappe
over
this
one
though
overall
i
do
enjoy
drinking
this
beer
its
certainly
no
rochefort
but
i
would
buy
it
again
maybe
overall
i
think
i
was
expecting
more
from
this
beer
it
was
good
dont
think
that
i
didnt
like
it
i
think
i
just
expected
more
for
me
the
alcohol
was
still
a
little
prevalent
and
i
think
it
could
benefit
with
some
age
wonderful
quad
very
easy
to
drink
scary
easy
worthy
and
then
some
o
i
thought
this
was
a
fantastic
beer
probably
one
of
the
best
browns
i
have
had
the
yeast
used
gives
it
a
nice
funkiness
and
a
twist
on
the
style
very
good
beerradvocate
calls
this
a
quad
but
on
the
bottle
it
says
abbeystyle
brown
ale
so
i
ll
review
it
as
an
abbeystyle
brown
ale
not
fair
to
them
otherwise
as
such
its
not
a
style
ive
run
across
before
so
i
dont
really
have
a
great
reference
point
however
i
am
enjoying
the
beer
the
alcohol
is
well
hidden
and
i
think
the
intended
flavors
come
through
i
get
a
nice
amount
of
malt
not
much
in
hops
not
much
in
anything
belgiany
either
but
if
you
look
deep
it
is
there
really
nice
one
of
there
better
brews
seek
it
out
if
you
can
its
a
rare
style
if
you
want
something
different
you
should
try
it
o
not
a
bad
beer
but
not
really
what
i
would
expect
from
a
quad
worth
a
try
i
suppose
excellent
beer
very
complex
flavors
ive
liked
everything
from
dieu
du
ciel
so
far
and
this
does
nothing
to
change
that
od
i
liked
this
one
a
lot
the
sweetness
up
front
fades
to
nice
bitterness
in
back
the
person
i
tasted
it
with
hated
it
didnt
like
the
sweet
flavors
if
you
like
sweetness
in
a
beer
you
should
definitely
give
this
one
a
try
a
heavy
brew
though
so
you
neednt
drink
more
than
one
at
a
time
i
drank
half
a
12oz
and
i
was
satisfied
poured
a
34
head
looks
hazy
brown
and
thick
kind
of
like
a
darker
brown
version
of
apple
cider
not
much
smell
at
all
other
than
the
slightest
hint
of
malt
taste
and
mouthfeel
is
where
this
truly
excells
and
id
liken
it
to
enjoying
some
nice
boston
baked
beans
theres
molasses
burnt
sugar
caramel
i
can
almost
even
taste
salt
pork
and
theres
a
smooth
body
but
almost
a
particulate
aspect
to
it
like
a
rich
sauce
the
taste
treat
makes
up
for
where
the
rest
isnt
tops
made
in
the
belgian
trappist
style
overall
this
beer
is
pretty
good
it
is
defiantely
a
sipper
i
would
drink
it
again
o
a
very
good
quad
might
be
a
little
too
much
bite
to
the
alcohol
for
me
but
its
definitely
got
everything
going
on
that
you
expect
in
a
solid
quad
very
dark
brown
in
color
with
a
very
slim
white
head
the
beer
is
moderately
carbonated
and
is
populated
with
notable
yeast
floaties
the
aroma
has
a
pronounced
alcohol
scent
followed
by
a
caramellike
scent
its
a
little
light
in
intensity
however
after
a
number
of
sips
the
yeast
and
phenolic
spice
come
out
in
the
aroma
but
they
take
a
little
coaxing
the
taste
is
sweet
yeasty
a
little
chocolaty
and
very
warming
the
boozy
warmth
boarders
on
harshness
at
times
but
the
sweet
toasted
malt
flavor
balance
it
full
in
body
and
very
drinkable
o
i
was
really
let
down
by
this
one
peche
mortel
got
me
sort
of
excited
about
this
brewery
but
this
was
not
enjoyable
a
beer
i
have
been
itching
for
but
was
waiting
for
the
right
mood
luckily
i
came
across
this
one
when
i
did
winter
release
recommend
6
months
of
storage
in
the
bottle
and
the
result
is
something
that
isnt
north
american
this
is
quebec
the
island
somewhere
in
the
atlantic
pour
is
a
murky
dubbel
orange
but
with
more
to
offer
nose
of
bit
o
honey
and
apple
pie
as
it
gets
warmer
some
goat
cheese
palate
is
a
meaty
thanksgiving
dinner
squash
apple
corn
pepper
brown
sugar
and
honey
all
contract
to
a
bitterness
that
dries
prunes
and
those
preserve
quality
fruits
a
tad
leather
smokey
doesnt
open
up
til
20
minutes
after
opening
ceiler
temp
is
best
because
the
carbonation
is
ever
lasting
as
it
expands
i
would
say
it
is
quite
drinkable
a
little
rough
on
the
mind
and
wallet
due
to
the
price
tag
and
high
alc
content
but
deserving
nonetheless
i
remember
on
several
occasions
that
the
dieu
du
ciel
brewmasters
brought
their
talents
and
their
presence
to
volo
cask
days
one
of
the
best
beer
events
if
youre
lucky
enough
to
get
tickets
cheers
to
dieu
du
ciel
keep
up
the
good
work
d
wasnt
really
sure
what
to
expect
with
my
first
quad
very
interesting
flavors
make
you
want
to
keep
drinking
very
nice
balance
here
would
like
to
compare
it
to
some
other
quads
though
the
higher
abv
is
nicely
masked
which
makes
it
pretty
drinkable
this
may
very
well
be
the
best
nonbelgian
brewed
quad
ive
ever
had
wow
dieu
du
ciel
never
ceases
to
amaze
just
wish
the
price
was
better
and
they
would
stop
using
screwtop
bottles
this
would
be
good
with
many
winter
food
profiles
as
well
as
many
desserts
and
could
also
be
a
sipper
nice
effort
they
gave
the
quadruple
a
try
and
didnt
do
that
great
of
a
job
perhaps
i
got
spoiled
because
my
first
quad
was
st
bernardus
abt
12
perhaps
as
a
result
i
am
not
inclined
to
recommend
this
beer
the
syrupy
mouthfeel
combined
with
the
phenols
honestly
made
me
think
i
was
drinking
cough
syrup
perhaps
this
is
better
super
fresh
or
mellows
with
age
mouthfeel
is
medium
to
average
with
adequate
carbonation
overall
this
is
a
miss
for
me
with
some
many
better
examples
of
a
quad
this
one
should
be
passed
over
in
favor
of
others
especially
for
5
a
pop
for
12
oz
not
recommended
dangerously
drinkable
stuff
this
was
an
excellent
beer
that
i
enjoyed
from
beginning
to
end
the
flavor
was
smooth
and
balanced
the
nose
was
full
bodied
and
a
bit
on
the
sweet
side
the
beer
was
just
what
you
want
out
of
a
quad
even
at
10
12
it
wasnt
to
much
although
i
think
one
is
enough
it
is
a
sipping
beer
and
needs
to
be
enjoyed
slow
and
discerningly
drinkability
a
sipper
for
sure
a
good
quad
that
i
am
enjoying
at
the
moment
while
i
check
out
this
nfc
championship
game
good
example
of
the
style
imo
while
the
alcohol
is
noticeable
its
not
overpowering
making
this
one
a
nice
sipper
not
dangerously
drinkable
but
pleasantly
so
i
would
suggest
trying
it
because
i
find
it
quite
interesting
and
enjoyable
turbid
dark
brown
in
colour
topped
by
a
thin
and
fast
receding
beige
head
that
doesnt
lace
estery
aroma
of
raisin
sour
cherry
and
overripe
banana
with
a
hint
of
alcohol
moderately
sweet
with
balancing
acidity
it
tastes
of
booze
soaked
raisins
and
hints
delicately
at
banana
bread
with
a
finish
that
suggests
tobacco
fullbodied
with
a
velvety
smooth
mouthfeel
a
rich
and
satisfying
sipper
rich
creamy
cheese
and
strong
tasting
salami
goes
well
with
this
big
flavorful
brew
fairly
smooth
fullbodied
mouthfeel
with
appropriate
carbonation
i
would
have
no
objection
to
having
another
really
fantastic
beer
from
dieu
du
ciel
i
would
say
a
applecaramel
notes
are
the
dominant
but
theyre
not
too
heavy
that
you
cant
enjoy
more
than
one
of
these
at
a
time
definitely
a
little
syrupy
but
served
cold
i
could
drink
this
all
night
looking
forward
to
finding
this
on
tap
d
i
love
me
some
dieu
du
ciel
abv
could
catch
up
to
you
quick
as
im
fairly
flushed
in
the
face
but
an
excellent
sipper
on
this
cold
festivus
night
there
will
be
no
airing
of
grievances
on
this
brew
notes
i
absolutely
love
this
beer
and
this
brewery
this
along
with
péché
mortel
and
aphrodisiaque
have
been
standouts
within
there
styles
and
they
are
some
of
my
favorite
beers
d
not
a
beer
you
want
to
have
a
lot
of
or
have
all
the
time
but
thats
also
not
its
goal
firstrate
drinkability
is
ok
but
i
dont
think
id
be
reaching
for
another
immediately
pours
a
deep
brownish
red
color
with
a
thin
white
tan
head
and
a
little
bit
of
lacing
smells
of
dark
fruits
malty
goodness
caramel
and
some
chocolate
tastes
of
cherries
malts
chocolate
caramel
and
some
fig
feels
medium
with
good
fizzy
carbonation
a
little
difficult
to
drink
drink
im
not
a
huge
fan
of
beers
with
this
particular
flavour
but
it
was
still
decent
and
highly
drinkable
considering
the
alcohol
content
its
definitely
worth
a
try
i
wish
i
lived
in
montreal
these
guys
make
some
solid
beers
and
this
is
another
winner
its
a
bit
different
than
most
quads
but
its
still
tasty
and
ephemeral
i
wish
the
price
here
in
michigan
was
better
so
i
could
enjoy
their
beers
all
the
time
but
as
it
is
it
makes
a
special
treat
passable
but
overall
too
sweet
and
too
much
alcohol
two
dimensional
not
enough
warmth
given
all
the
booziness
of
it
just
a
one
off
for
me
d
not
bad
for
a
quad
but
i
cant
pound
one
of
these
because
of
both
the
flavor
and
the
price
would
rather
go
for
a
rochefort
10
or
a
st
bernardus
12
for
the
money
this
brew
is
sweet
and
coats
the
tounge
with
a
maltiness
and
warm
alchohol
a
good
sipper
that
would
do
well
cutting
a
spicy
blue
cheese
d
it
drank
decent
but
was
a
bit
on
the
boozy
side
which
made
it
a
tad
difficult
to
take
down
definitely
a
sipper
it
thought
it
was
a
good
interpretation
of
a
quad
from
canadians
not
bad
but
i
had
higher
hopes
for
a
quad
from
this
brewery
id
have
it
again
but
given
a
choice
i
would
go
for
one
of
the
more
classic
quads
ok
but
there
are
many
more
tastey
examples
of
this
style
available
this
one
is
too
boozy
and
sweet
try
it
but
dont
expect
much
although
unibroue
is
my
favorite
frenchcanadian
brewery
ddc
is
close
behind
with
a
long
line
of
quality
offerings
this
one
included
st
bernardus
abt
12
is
coming
soon
to
the
lcbo
but
for
now
this
is
the
only
quad
available
and
a
fine
one
at
that
im
interested
in
comparing
the
two
another
great
seasonal
from
the
lcbo
and
one
well
worth
picking
up
thick
mouthfeel
not
much
carbonation
and
pretty
drinkable
considering
the
alcohol
content
not
the
best
quad
ever
not
something
i
would
buy
again
but
still
well
done
d
good
drinkability
for
a
bigger
beer
especially
for
a
quad
but
its
a
bit
too
thin
just
a
little
watery
feeling
on
the
finish
good
flavor
and
profile
though
for
a
comparable
price
id
go
for
koneningshoeven
or
new
glarus
abt
over
this
one
not
a
bad
quad
certainly
tasty
and
fun
to
drink
definitely
will
need
cellaring
for
a
while
to
even
things
out
because
again
i
found
my
bottle
of
rigor
mortis
to
be
quite
hot
almost
too
sweet
but
the
spiciness
kept
it
relatively
in
check
will
be
back
for
more
for
cellaring
purposes
weak
by
way
of
body
especially
given
the
appearance
not
too
boozy
despite
the
hefty
abv
not
something
id
ever
desire
to
order
again
this
is
perfection
on
a
cold
winters
night
the
10
5
abv
certainly
warms
the
chest
and
is
relatively
well
hidden
ddc
has
done
it
again
this
is
one
for
the
cellar
d
top
draw
quad
this
one
upon
that
initial
whiff
this
offering
kind
of
gave
me
the
impression
that
this
would
be
one
hot
mess
nope
very
well
integrated
alcohol
big
fruity
malt
and
a
more
or
less
belgianesque
yeast
and
hop
profile
all
adds
up
to
just
a
wellbalanced
and
relatively
easy
to
put
back
21
proof
abbeystyle
ale
take
that
as
you
will
but
take
it
well
and
easy
this
overall
isnt
bad
but
i
found
the
alcohol
to
be
a
little
too
overstated
affecting
drinkability
and
the
overall
enjoyment
if
the
alcohol
was
toned
down
a
bit
this
would
be
really
good
but
it
was
a
worth
a
try
either
way
well
made
beer
i
teetered
back
and
forth
on
the
taste
score
and
settled
on
the
higher
one
interesting
and
somewhat
complex
and
with
some
nuance
but
it
doesnt
set
the
standard
for
the
style
certainly
worth
a
try
if
you
like
the
brewery
and
the
style
as
i
do
dvery
drinkable
even
with
the
high
abv
a
nice
winter
beer
drinkability
is
astonishingly
not
bad
for
10
percent
abv
it
doesnt
have
screeching
harshness
or
sugars
that
make
your
head
spin
and
so
its
a
reliable
long
sipper
of
a
beer
that
discloses
lovely
new
tastes
as
you
drink
it

d
very
nice
abt
not
something
i
could
drink
all
the
time
but
something
for
a
special
occasion
for
sure
pours
a
dark
chestnut
brown
colour
with
a
decent
amount
of
head
in
the
duvel
tulip
glass
tastes
of
caramal
brown
sugars
with
a
nice
dark
fruit
taste
in
there
too
the
booze
is
hidden
quite
decently
for
this
double
percentage
beer
drinks
very
smooth
glad
i
picked
up
quite
a
few
bottles
of
this
great
brewery
impressed
with
all
their
beers
so
far
very
complex
needs
some
cheese
as
balance
dsurprisingly
drinkable
the
sweetness
wasnt
overpowering
and
nicely
balanced
by
the
alcohol
spiciness
d
a
nice
beer
but
a
touch
hot
d
fair
high
abv
makes
this
hard
to
session
obviously
but
i
could
have
more
than
one
for
sure
not
the
most
complex
quad
by
any
stretch
of
the
imagination
but
a
nice
sipper
funny
that
a
beer
named
rigor
mortis
should
be
such
a
stiff
drink
rigor
mortis
abt
doesnt
quite
compare
to
its
belgian
counterparts
but
it
does
imitate
them
well
if
you
have
any
bottles
in
your
possession
i
suggest
you
find
them
a
cool
dark
place
and
let
them
just
be
for
a
couple
of
years
my
guess
is
theyll
come
back
a
much
better
beer
but
doubtfully
one
that
will
ever
be
confused
as
belonging
to
belgiums
great
trappist
monasteries
jd
d
a
sipper
for
sure
has
a
lot
of
initial
kick
in
each
sip
and
definite
booziness
after
each
sip
booziness
attacked
my
nose
as
i
exhaled
i
think
im
going
to
let
my
other
couple
bottles
age
for
a
bit
to
smooth
them
out
and
tone
the
alcohol
down
full
of
flavor
but
pretty
simple
for
a
quad
was
expecting
a
little
better
for
a
ddc
creation
but
they
still
did
alright
very
nice
version
of
a
belgian
quad
well
done
d
it
seems
a
bit
hotyoung
right
now
ill
have
to
put
a
few
away
i
feel
like
this
could
round
out
into
something
special
with
a
bit
of
time
its
got
a
nice
flavour
profile
and
punch
it
just
seems
like
everything
has
had
quite
enough
time
to
marry
a
pleasant
drop
with
good
flavours
quality
over
quantity
really
whats
there
is
tasty
but
i
kind
of
expect
more
from
10

rigor

is
the
stiffness
that
occurs
in
the
muscles
following

rigor
mortis
abt
makes
me
glad
that
rigor
mortis
has
not
yet
impaired
my
ability
to
enjoy
expertly
brewed
beer
in
my
humble
opinion
this
offering
is
better
than
the
muchheralded
peche
mortel
and
is
brasserie
dieu
du
ciels
finest
creation
bold
on
the
sip
sweet
taste
with
a
bit
of
heat
in
the
finish
seems
to
be
alot
of
sugar
mixed
in
it
does
taste
like
what
they
put
on
the
botttle
extra
strong
abbeystyle
brown
ale
medium
bodied
for
the
mouthfeel
overall
another
good
beer
from
ddc
for
the
rigor
mortis
i
probably
would
only
have
one
as
the
10
5
is
decent
on
its
own
picked
up
a
couple
to
put
away
and
try
every
now
and
then
drinkability
a
very
good
beer
in
the
style
quadrupel
finally
the
control
board
in
ontario
brings
in
rigor
mortis
pours
a
ruby
brown
colour
with
big
offwhite
head
lacing
surrounds
the
glass
smells
of
dried
fruit
belgian
yeast
and
some
alcohol
flavour
is
quite
boozy
yet
there
is
a
lot
of
sweetness
nice
carbonation
im
going
to
buy
a
whole
bunch
of
bottles
because
i
think
this
will
age
nicely
decent
enough
but
i
was
underwhelmed
after
taking
a
sip
dont
get
me
wrong
its
still
a
very
good
beer
but
it
feels
like
its
lacking
for
the
style
pours
a
moderately
dark
nifty
brown
with
a
thin
head
nose
brings
a
good
amount
of
dark
fruits
brown
sugar
molasses
and
a
bit
of
booze
the
taste
melds
dark
fruits
with
some
dark
rum
characteristics
feel
is
nice
fairly
heavy
with
a
good
amount
of
alcohol
warmth
drinks
fairly
well
but
is
not
their
best
offering
pours
a
very
dark
rubyamber
color
with
an
offwhitetan
head
that
isnt
too
large
scent
is
very
spicy
with
a
bit
of
booziness
a
lot
of
fruitiness
comes
through
in
the
nose
as
well
lots
of
plums
and
red
grapes
the
spiciness
overcomes
though
the
taste
is
initially
strong
candied
sugar
and
dark
fruits
a
bit
of
caramel
and
dark
chocolate
linger
on
the
back
of
my
palate
as
well
the
booziness
is
very
upfront
and
stays
there
in
the
aftertaste
glad
i
bought
another
one
to
see
how
this
beer
ages
and
lets
the
alcohol
settle
mouthfeel
full
bodied
and
a
bit
syrupy
but
at
the
same
time
a
bit
more
carbonated
than
other
quads
ive
had
drinkability
is
medium
and
could
be
higher
if
wasnt
so
boozy
quads
are
not
my
favorite
style
but
i
found
this
one
quite
enjoyable
glad
i
tried
this
this
belgian
dark
strong
ale
favors
the
dark
fruit
and
sugar
sweetness
but
the
beer
is
beautifully
crafted
and
delicious
enough
that
the
spicyhoppy
balance
doesnt
matter
a
softer
more
powdery
malt
character
would
allow
it
to
compete
with
the
rochefort
10
and
such
too
sweet
and
boozy
for
extended
drinking
but
enjoyable
for
the
occasional
pour
d
not
great
this
beer
was
a
bit
too
strong
for
me
not
my
style
d
definitely
not
one
i
will
be
purchasing
again
was
too
strong
and
not
enough
flavor
d
just
terrible
total
drain
pour
ddc
is
so
mediocre
i
dont
understand
the
hype
this
has
motivated
me
to
explore
the
wide
range
of
product
available
from
brasserie
dieu
du
ciel
and
i
recommend
others
give
it
try
but
i
dont
see
it
charging
through
the
old
tried
and
trusted
offerings
in
this
category
inviting
beer
not
too
sweet
or
sugary
with
the
belgian
yeast
doing
some
of
the
work
good
no
matter
where
its
brewed
the
overall
flavour
here
is
good
but
not
great
the
sweetness
is
overpowering
and
the
flavours
dont
quite
integrate
as
well
as
the
belgian
examples
of
this
style
this
is
a
very
good
beer
and
one
of
the
best
nonbelgian
quads
that
ive
tried
tt
doesnt
seem
fair
to
rate
this
one
to
style
but
thats
what
im
trying
to
do
on
an
absolute
scale
these
scores
would
all
go
up
about
a
half
point
this
beer
pours
a
cloudy
light
brown
color
with
a
medium
head
that
hangs
around
for
a
while
the
aroma
is
very
sweet
with
some
caramel
and
fruit
notes
the
flavor
is
much
the
same
with
caramel
malts
some
fruit
alcohol
and
some
spicy
phenols
not
terribly
complex
but
nice
the
finish
is
fairly
dry
and
the
body
is
on
the
lighter
end
of
medium
drinkability
is
pretty
good
for
the
high
level
of
alcohol
but
i
wasnt
terribly
impressed
with
this
beer
d
all
the
aspects
of
this
quad
are
good
but
the
alcohol
is
a
little
too
strong
for
my
liking
ideally
the
alcohol
bite
on
the
finish
could
be
a
little
more
hidden
its
a
worthy
offering
and
worth
a
try
to
any
fan
of
quads
having
only
had
a
few
different
quads
to
date
this
is
the
first
that
ive
really
noticed
the
alcohol
but
the
malty
flavours
were
quite
tasty
nonetheless
pours
a
murky
murky
brown
with
an
okay
head
that
fades
to
a
ring
in
the
nose
there
are
nice
belgian
yeast
notes
of
banana
clove
coriander
a
touch
chalky
and
bready
the
taste
has
very
nice
fruit
and
a
bit
of
breadiness
with
a
long
finish
that
has
a
nice
combination
of
bitterness
sweetness
and
spice
nice
notes
of
banana
clove
pear
and
spicebox
sweet
bready
and
thick
in
the
mouth
overall
pretty
nice
d
alc
is
pretty
well
hidden
not
really
amazing
for
a
quad
but
a
good
brew
a
bit
more
on
the
sweet
side
easy
drinker
perhaps
a
good
crossover
for
a
fan
of
brown
ales
looking
to
get
more
into
quads
this
brew
pours
a
reddishcopperoff
brown
hue
with
decent
carbonation
that
leaves
behind
a
brown
glazed
head
and
a
rim
of
lacingthe
aromas
are
brown
sugardark
fruitsalcohol
with
big
hints
of
some
oak
and
wood
charactersit
has
a
nice
rich
creamysticky
mouthfeel
with
tastes
of
brown
sugaroakplums
and
some
sticky
date
pudding
aswelloverall
its
not
a
bad
drop
that
is
quite
rich
and
true
to
the
style
but
the
one
for
tonight
is
enough
for
mei
could
definately
see
this
as
a
great
brew
to
accompany
a
nice
rich
dessert
cheers
d
the
mix
of
aromas
and
flavours
is
fantastic
and
while
this
is
a
quadrupel
ale
meant
to
be
very
strong
the
alcohol
content
and
bite
do
limit
the
drinkability
but
none
the
less
is
a
great
brew
d
intresting
and
quite
good
ddc
labels
it
as
a
abbey
brown
ale
and
i
think
it
acomplishes
that
it
could
use
some
time
to
mellow
out
though
drinkability
is
pretty
good
a
solid
quad
but
with
room
for
improvement
overpriced
especially
since
i
live
on
the
same
continent
bottled
on
04
2010
so
it
is
a
bit
young
poured
into
a
duvel
tulip
clear
dark
brown
with
a
quarter
inch
bubbly
head
which
rapidly
dissipates
to
a
ring
some
fugitive
lacing
smells
of
malts
and
esters
taste
is
very
smooth
malt
flavours
up
front
with
a
long
alcohol
finish
medium
body
with
a
moderate
carbonation
drinkability
is
good
but
the
high
alcohol
will
limit
a
session
drinkability
as
the
label
indicates
this
one
should
be
aged
for
six
months
for
the
perfect
taste
and
i
can
see
why
with
that
being
said
the
beer
was
not
bad
at
all
in
its
early
stage
i
probably
would
only
drink
one
of
these
in
any
given
session
cellared
or
not
again
i
am
a
bit
disappointed
by
a
dieu
du
ciel
beer
this
is
i
am
guessing
about
a
year
old
bottle
as
encouraged
by
the
brewer
pours
a
strange
looking
brownamber
with
a
nice
fluffy
head
nose
is
dark
fruits
brown
sugar
alcohol
and
clove
taste
is
a
real
blast
of
sweetness
in
kind
of
a
fruit
rollup
way
just
over
the
top
and
artificial
something
is
off
although
as
it
warms
it
is
more
pleasant
alcohol
well
hidden
in
the
taste
and
a
nice
dry
finish
strange
beer
drinkablity
solid
but
nothing
that
sits
in
your
stomache
d
i
like
this
a
lot
really
no
ethanol
heat
great
flavours
belgian
complexity
an
outstanding
quad
for
my
palate
this
was
expensive
as
hell
at
beachwood
dieu
du
ciel
needs
to
get
distributed
down
in
the
southland
with
this
and
peche
mortel
its
game
over
nice
creamy
tan
head
over
a
mahogany
elixir
good
lace
as
well
nose
has
dark
fruits
spicy
yeast
peppery
alcohol
and
candy
malts
taste
is
a
nice
balance
of
sweet
bready
malts
herbal
yeast
cocoa
and
spices
thick
creamy
body
is
well
carbonated
nice
canadian
quad
d
it
goes
down
easily
enough
but
i
didnt
get
a
ton
of
complexity
from
this
one
i
could
certainly
drink
another
but
i
wouldnt
be
excited
about
it
this
brew
reminds
me
why
i
love
a
good
quad
so
much
its
a
great
style
and
they
nailed
it
quite
a
surpise
considering
it
came
with
little
fanfare
quite
the
quad
and
i
think
ill
have
another
d
the
beer
is
very
easy
to
drink
once
it
warms
up
and
the
alcohol
is
relatively
well
masked
poured
a
clear
brown
color
with
an
average
creamy
brown
head
that
lasted
with
excellent
lacing
moderate
to
heavy
earthy
yeasty
and
alcohol
aroma
medium
to
full
body
with
a
smooth
sticky
texture
and
soft
carbonation
medium
to
heavy
bittersweet
flavor
with
a
medium
to
heavy
bittersweet
finish
of
moderate
to
long
duration
with
a
small
alcohol
burn
this
is
a
good
complex
brew
another
hit
from
the
folks
at
dieu
du
ciel
not
the
spitting
image
of
a
quad
but
definitely
taking
some
of
the
best
aspects
of
that
style
and
putting
a
new
twist
on
it
fine
specimen
d
overall
a
very
respectable
attempt
at
the
trappist
style
this
is
really
an
enjoyable
brew
and
at
a
severely
discounted
price
compared
to
the
belgian
offerings
this
is
another
great
from
dieu
du
ciel
flavor
is
nice
in
this
one
but
the
heat
the
heat
d
this
brew
reminded
me
of
how
much
i
love
a
good
quadrupel
its
a
great
style
and
theyve
nailed
it
you
have
a
to
love
a
beer
with
a
name
like
rigor
mortis
with
a
picture
of
a
corpse
on
the
label
it
pours
a
rose
color
with
about
two
fingers
of
white
heading
the
nose
is
very
boozy
with
traces
of
dark
fruit
rose
petals
and
gum
lots
of
juicy
fruit
comes
through
in
the
taste
along
with
some
brown
sugar
overall
though
the
alcohol
really
overwhelms
things
here
it
comes
off
as
very
syrupyfull
bodied
and
sweet
without
much
balance
to
even
things
out
not
a
bad
drinker
but
i
would
recommend
sipping
this
beer
as
it
is
heavy
at
times
i
am
not
too
sure
when
this
was
brewed
but
the
label
says
that
it
needs
at
least
six
months
to
age
so
maybe
that
is
exactly
what
is
needed
here
all
4s
for
a
beer
this
big
it
happens
to
be
fairly
drinkable
im
savouring
each
sip
and
will
be
enjoying
this
for
a
while
yet
i
imagine
a
good
example
of
the
style
im
wondering
if
i
should
have
let
this
one
age
slightly
longer
at
any
rate
im
glad
to
have
tried
this
rich
and
tasty
brew
and
would
gladly
drink
again
d
a
big
abbey
brown
more
like
a
quad
drinkability
wise
but
shares
a
lot
with
dubbel
in
the
sense
that
it
has
plenty
of
creamy
raisiny
toasty
less
roasty
flavor
i
was
certainly
happy
to
share
this
and
could
probably
enjoy
several
with
ease
another
great
beer
from
brasserie
dieu
du
ciel
d
great
overall
unsure
if
it
is
worth
8
for
a
single
12
oz
bottle
though
picked
up
a
bottle
at
abes
cold
beer
for
5
50
ah
this
is
a
wellmade
quad
its
nice
to
find
north
american
belgian
ales
that
taste
like
they
could
come
straight
from
a
belgian
abbey
the
aroma
is
a
bit
mellow
with
hint
of
prune
and
raisin
plus
a
hint
of
grape
juice
essentially
it
smells
like
a
mixed
bag
of
dried
fruit
the
flavor
matches
those
esters
but
add
caramel
and
toffee
malt
character
that
at
times
is
both
dry
and
juicy
theres
a
slight
hint
of
alcohol
which
is
ok
for
the
style
since
its
not
distracting
the
malt
also
brings
toast
and
dark
bread
crust
that
allows
this
beer
to
border
on
desert
without
being
too
sweet
really
i
think
this
is
an
underrated
quad
and
would
be
happy
to
enjoy
it
more
often
the
only
real
knock
against
it
is
the
toomild
aroma
notes
hmmm
not
something
to
look
for
explicitly
from
dieu
du
ciel
its
a
decent
quad
but
the
sugar
tones
fall
a
bit
short
of
being
woven
in
the
malty
range
and
that
metallicish
finish
while
not
bad
does
not
give
it
a
particularly
enticing
profile
really
really
creepy
label
now
that
aside
a
really
interesting
beer
as
well
flavor
profile
was
unlike
any
belgianinspired
beer
ive
had
not
sure
when
my
bottle
was
produced
but
it
certainly
had
the
hallmarks
of
one
that
had
been
waiting
for
a
while
amazingly
mellow
for
the
whopping
abv
very
low
bitterness
with
brown
sugar
sweetness
and
a
touch
of
oaky
vanilla
mouthfeel
had
a
unique
creamy
nature
almost
as
if
lactose
sugar
had
been
used
surprisingly
drinkable
cheers
rigor
mortis
abt
has
a
great
mouthfeel
smooth
and
creamy
but
not
overly
thick
medium
carbonation
overall
a
good
but
not
great
quadrupel
it
lacks
the
dessertlike
spice
that
i
have
come
to
love
in
classic
quads
such
as
st
bernardus
due
to
the
price
tag
i
wont
be
buying
this
again
but
i
would
gladly
drink
it
if
offered
to
me
d
a
very
interesting
quad
that
is
really
great
with
that
chocolatey
nut
kick
fits
the
style
has
a
few
twists
from
the
traditional
my
only
complaint
is
that
5
68
for
this
is
a
little
steep
just
for
11
5
oz
its
good
but
for
the
i
would
probably
gravitate
elsewhere
for
the
style
all
in
all
this
is
not
one
of
the
better
brews
from
them
they
do
have
some
good
ones
so
def
dont
put
this
on
your
list
to
hunt
down
if
you
want
to
try
something
good
from
them
try
aphrodite
or
peche
mortel
good
to
try
once
if
you
like
hops
11
5
ounce
bottle
served
in
a
goblet
the
beer
pours
a
brownishred
color
with
about
a
14
inch
tan
head
however
the
small
head
stayed
around
a
while
and
there
was
a
decent
amount
of
lacing
too
aroma
is
dark
fruit
raisins
figs
caramel
malt
brown
sugar
and
some
apples
the
taste
is
similar
to
the
aroma
but
with
the
addition
of
some
bananas
spice
cherries
and
some
nuts
mouthfeelbody
is
mediumfull
its
a
bit
coating
rich
and
is
well
carbonated
drinkability
is
decent
enough
the
10
5
abv
isnt
as
strong
in
the
taste
as
you
think
it
would
be
but
you
can
feel
it
after
a
little
while
i
think
this
is
a
good
brew
although
im
not
sure
id
buy
it
too
often
at
5
49
a
bottle
but
if
youve
never
had
it
before
i
still
think
its
worth
trying
this
is
a
pretty
nice
beer
the
biggest
flaw
is
that
the
alcohol
can
be
a
bit
too
noticeable
at
times
it
doesnt
ruin
the
beer
for
me
though
interesting
this
might
be
quite
phenomenal
if
not
for
the
hot
alcohol
i
wish
i
had
bought
a
second
bottle
to
age
a
bit
longer
opinion
unfortunately
i
was
pretty
disappointed
in
this
beer
overall
it
has
rode
on
my
motorcycle
for
the
last
few
hours
but
i
let
it
sit
for
at
least
3
hours
in
the
fridge
before
i
drank
it
i
thought
that
it
may
come
across
as
more
yeasty
as
a
result
but
it
is
the
alcohol
that
makes
the
beer
out
of
balance
i
like
this
a
lot
i
like
the
different
boundaries
that
dieu
du
ciel
pushi
wish
i
could
get
more
of
their
wares
this
poured
into
a
small
tulip
glass
a
hazed
russett
color
with
some
orange
glowa
sticky
one
finger
white
head
atop
a
mix
of
dark
fruit
and
phenolic
spice
in
the
nosethe
alcohol
creeps
as
it
warms
flavors
are
not
overly
complex
but
pack
good
flavordark
fruitand
brown
sugar
flavors
stand
out
mostagain
as
it
warms
the
alcohol
really
comes
in
its
not
overly
complex
but
its
pretty
goodwatch
out
the
alcohol
will
hit
ya
i
like
this
one
but
the
one
is
enough
for
me
the
carbonation
and
alcohol
notes
make
it
a
little
less
of
an
easy
sipper
but
its
still
a
fine
beer
in
my
eyes
this
is
a
pretty
good
quad
but
a
slow
sipper
that
gets
a
little
cloying
as
it
goes
on
d
this
is
a
very
smooth
and
well
balanced
quad
very
delicous
not
as
complex
as
some
the
alcohol
is
extremely
well
hidden
and
makes
this
very
drinkable
feel
and
drinkability
carbonation
is
low
and
very
fine
as
befits
the
style
anything
else
and
itd
totally
blow
this
beer
body
is
heavy
and
this
beer
is
definitely
one
to
sip
on
its
not
like
other
belgian
styles
that
ive
had
there
isnt
all
that
much
sweet
dark
fruit
and
dark
candy
flavor
or
aroma
here
an
impression
of
smokiness
and
burnt
or
very
darkly
roasted
grains
no
maybe
not
that
but
heavily
roasted
barley
and
very
much
graininess
this
is
one
that
ill
sip
on
till
its
gone
but
really
i
dont
think
its
worth
the
5
50
i
paid
for
it
im
not
saying
to
steer
clear
but
there
is
definitely
better
out
there
for
quads
ive
only
had
five
hundred
and
change
beers
and
i
can
tell
you
there
are
better
quads
out
there
i
guess
its
all
about
personal
taste
this
is
not
a
traditional
belgian
quad
i
think
its
very
much
different
i
prefer
the
traditional
to
this
not
a
big
fan
of
that
black
patent
or
heavily
roasted
barley
esp
when
its
mixed
with
a
high
alcohol
brew
such
as
this
quite
full
bodied
but
the
carbonation
is
a
bit
weak
although
of
the
right
kind
with
small
soft
bubbles
danother
excellent
brew
by
brasserie
dieu
du
ciel
this
is
a
favorite
style
of
mine
and
i
highly
recommend
this
brew
i
am
a
fan
i
honestly
think
this
is
my
favorite
belgian
quad
to
date
it
just
has
a
great
pronounced
chocolatebrown
sugar
flavor
which
i
like
a
lot
very
complex
and
very
tasty
seek
this
one
out
overall
this
beer
this
is
another
solid
effort
from
brasserie
dieu
du
ciel
i
very
much
enjoyed
this
quad
and
found
it
not
only
easy
to
drink
but
quite
flavorful
nothing
earthshattering
just
a
wellcrafted
beer
recommended
t
the
quad
is
one
of
the
most
complex
beerstyles
and
the
masters
of
it
are
from
belgium
especially
trappistmonks
this
is
a
nice
try
from
another
country
i
will
buy
this
one
again
but
i
prefer
the
belgian
ones
i
did
enjoy
rigor
mortis
and
rate
it
highly
in
everything
but
drinkability
pours
a
murky
amberbrown
with
a
very
thin
head
and
some
below
average
lacing
the
smell
is
of
raisins
belgian
yeast
brown
sugar
and
a
hint
of
booze
the
flavor
is
similar
in
profile
to
the
smell
but
not
quite
as
hot
a
very
mellow
malty
belgian
flavor
with
hints
of
dark
dried
fruits
and
spices
the
mouthfeel
seems
a
bit
thin
at
first
but
it
thickens
some
with
warming
and
its
drinkable
but
not
as
much
as
other
quads
i
have
tried
this
is
the
second
beer
from
brasserie
i
have
been
impressed
withthe
other
being
peche
mortel
and
i
will
have
to
keep
my
eyes
open
for
more
a
qualified
quad
good
craft
but
nothing
extraordinary
a
sipper
no
doubt
and
with
a
nottoothick
mouthfeel
over
a
pleasant
flavor
its
a
winner
this
is
a
good
drinkable
beer
unfortunately
the
9
5abv
while
not
overpowering
is
a
little
too
noticeable
this
is
akin
to
a
sweeter
st
bernardus
abt
12
but
the
st
bernardus
has
10
5abv
which
is
better
masked
drinkability
this
ones
definitely
a
quad
its
stylistically
pretty
spot
on
and
shows
how
you
can
make
a
really
stylistically
spot
on
beer
thats
just
not
terribly
impressive
its
not
bad
but
it
is
decidedly
mediocre
it
helps
that
its
a
little
low
on
the
abv
side
or
at
least
you
cant
taste
it
that
easily
but
only
so
much
really
perhaps
worth
one
try
but
there
are
way
better
quads
out
there
m
nice
karbonated
smouth
a
perfect
cheese
beer
easy
to
drink
and
enjoy
i
recommend
this
one
poured
into
a
chalice
a
nice
cloudy
grapish
color
nice
carbonation
nice
little
fizzy
tan
head
with
some
nice
small
islands
and
sticky
lacing
left
behind
the
nose
is
malty
lots
of
nice
dark
fruit
notes
and
some
caramel
the
taste
is
sweet
malty
nice
touch
of
raisins
figs
grapes
plums
medium
body
drinkable
this
is
a
pretty
nice
brew
glad
to
have
had
a
chance
to
try
it
thanks
carl
pours
brown
with
crimson
hints
a
little
on
the
cloudy
side
with
a
full
tan
head
aroma
is
sweet
and
malty
with
a
definite
alcoholic
tinge
and
some
background
aromas
of
dark
fruit
taste
is
much
like
the
aroma
with
a
nice
sweet
malt
base
but
the
alcohol
is
really
dominant
and
of
the
hotter
fusel
variety
often
associated
with
a
hot
fermentation
once
past
the
alcohol
you
do
get
a
little
of
the
dark
raisin
and
prune
flavors
in
the
finish
the
mouthfeel
is
full
and
slightly
syrupy
but
not
to
the
overpoweringly
cloying
extent
this
is
a
nice
beer
that
could
be
a
great
beer
if
the
fusels
could
be
backed
off
the
body
is
mediumthick
a
little
chewy
a
nice
substantial
base
for
such
a
substantial
flavor
definitely
a
sipper
my
throat
is
burning
a
little
like
im
pounding
a
weak
liqueur
an
approachable
quad
no
doubt
about
that
nothing
intense
or
over
the
top
just
a
smooth
operator
all
around
sade
would
approve
this
is
worth
getting
your

on

you

in

it
is
sticky
sweet
and
substantial
taste
is
a
little
of
a
let
down
overall
it
is
pleasant
and
similar
to
aroma
but
alcohol
is
too
evident
i
am
guessing
that
this
is
a
young
bottle
and
the
beer
will
improve
greatly
with
some
aging
the
label
mentions
that
the
beer
is
at
its
best
after
at
least
six
month
aging

meadium
i
wouldve
prefered
something
fuller

spoiled
by

cool

thats
always
a
plus
in
my
book
this
bottle
was
picked
up
at
half
time
a
week
ago
drinkability
high
alcohol
kocks
this
down
a
notch
but
for
a
quad
this
was
smooth
and
tasty
but
a
slow
sipper
nice
enough
but
a
bit
challenging
o
drink
because
of
the
aggressiveness
of
the
alcohol
flavor
d
a
drinkable
version
of
a
belgian
quad
dark
brown
body
with
a
disappointingly
anemic
head
smell
is
typical
quad
dark
fruitiness
the
taste
is
incredibly
mild
chocolate
cherries
spices
and
dark
fruits
are
all
there
but
they
dont
jump
out
at
you
at
all
you
have
to
work
for
them
this
is
definitely
the
subtlest
quad
ive
ever
had
worth
a
try
if
youre
a
fan
of
belgians
well
constructed
tasty
all
the
way
just
needs
some
time
or
something
to
hide
the
alcohol
burn
better
d
drinks
decently
for
a
quad
mouthfeel
is
thick
and
well
carbonated
and
the
beer
is
easy
to
drink
a
little
less
sweetness
and
alcohol
would
land
this
one
a
5
for
drinkability
but
as
it
is
it
remains
very
drinkable
in
its
own
right
pours
a
dark
brown
colored
body
with
a
small
creamy
whitish
head
somewhat
lasting
strong
aroma
of
dark
fruit
fig
and
plum
some
alcohol
too
creamy
mouthfeel
some
warmth
dark
fruit
in
the
taste
too
some
acidic
bitterness
some
more
sugary
sweetness
as
it
warms
up
some
roasted
flavors
too
more
as
it
warms
at
volo
on
tap
had
a
few
samples
of
this
a
deep
hazed
dirty
brown
with
a
nice
structured
eggshell
cap
nose
is
full
on
stewed
fruits
lots
of
sugars
caramel
vanilla
spices
tastes
very
sweet
of
belgian
candy
sugars
bubblegum
caramel
vanilla
floral
spices
a
bit
oaky
very
good
quite
drinkable
for
the
strength
a
creamy
and
sweet
and
silky
finish
excellent
example
of
this
elusive
style
this
is
a
very
good
interpretation
of
a
belgian
quad
id
definitely
try
to
track
this
down
again
well
balanced
and
very
drinkable
thanks
to
imagineii
for
sending
me
the
bottle
pours
a
murky
chocolate
brown
color
with
a
tight
and
creamy
head
that
settles
quickly
into
a
chunky
ring
the
aroma
is
of
red
grapes
and
a
light
belgian
yeast
spice
a
bit
underwhelming
for
a
bsdaquad
the
taste
is
of
grape
juice
some
prune
a
bit
of
spice
and
candi
sugar
nice
but
again
underwhelming
a
moderate
feel
with
a
good
amount
of
carbonation
on
the
sweet
side
but
very
subdued
for
the
style
crisp
and
refreshing
drinks
very
nice
the
abv
is
noticable
but
not
over
the
top
balanced
good
carbonation
you
could
get
yourself
in
trouble
drinking
this
one
the
flavor
profile
is
quite
light
for
the
style
the
brew
has
some
of
the
dark
fruit
flavors
but
not
much
malt
good
but
falls
short
in
the
flavor
department
overall
this
was
pretty
damn
solid
albeit
a
little
hot
still
with
a
year
or
two
on
it
this
would
be
damn
near
outstanding
d
this
is
a
smooth
easygoing
quad
one
that
you
could
drink
slowly
for
a
little
while
drinkability
a
very
nice
example
of
the
style
that
is
less
sweet
and
cloying
than
many
i
have
tasted
from
the
old
country
d
the
aroma
is
very
nice
but
the
flavor
just
doesnt
live
up
to
it
an
unfortunate
trend
i
have
noticed
with
dieu
du
ciel
the
rough
alcohol
and
sweet
malt
make
for
an
oddly
cloying
beer
despite
the
dry
finish
it
may
just
need
some
age
to
bring
things
together
but
it
isnt
all
that
great
right
now
drinkability
isnt
very
high
here
because
of
the
alcohol
surprisingly
drinkable
i
wish
i
had
another
one
on
hand
overall
impression
enjoyable
however
slightly
offbalanced
throughtout
it
could
have
used
more
aging
to
smooth
this
beer
out
other
note
i
tasted
no
chocolate
as
indicated
by
the
brewers
site
the
taste
is
holycowspiceandcaramel
in
your
face
like
a
less
boozy
version
of
rochefort
10
which
im
not
a
huge
fan
of
very
interesting
really
although
not
all
that
complex
the
body
is
full
but
it
just
doesnt
have
that
extra
pep
in
the
taste
to
put
it
over
the
edge
overall
a
solid
quad
that
i
probably
wont
bother
visiting
again
d
fairly
drinkable
i
didnt
notice
any
evolution
after
another
one
d
the
drinkability
of
this
beer
is
rather
hard
to
describe
it
is
a
good
beer
but
while
i
can
get
st
bernardus
abt
12
for
the
same
price
which
is
a
superior
quad
i
cant
see
myself
getting
this
one
again
a
pretty
good
belgian
style
quad
well
worth
the
3
50
pick
it
up
its
a
good
quad
if
you
are
into
extreme
beer
pick
up
a
few
of
these
bad
boys
pours
a
muddy
reddish
brown
color
with
some
fine
sediment
and
a
big
fluffy
tan
head
decent
retention
not
quite
up
to
the
belgian
standard
the
aroma
really
shoots
out
of
the
glass
with
rummy
raisin
at
the
fore
and
some
accents
of
cinnamon
chocolate
chip
cookie
slight
licorice
and
a
hint
of
peppery
alcohol
flavor
is
a
bit
of
a
letdown
after
the
excellent
aroma
its
just
not
quite
as
robust
and
wellrounded
bready
and
yeasty
without
much
sweetness
licorice
and
spicy
alcohol
in
the
finish
a
little
hot
but
not
bad
the
alcohol
does
sort
of
thin
out
the
body
a
bit
carbonation
is
pleasant
drinkability
is
decent
good
for
a
nonbelgian
quad
but
not
even
close
to
the
authentic
classics
pours
hazy
medium
brown
with
offtan
colored
head
that
is
quite
thick
at
first
laces
well
and
retains
a
thin
layer
through
the
entire
pint
nose
has
soft
baked
good
sweetness
such
as
cookies
or
brownies
along
with
some
yeastbready
components
palate
has
a
soft
maltyroasty
flavor
that
becomes
a
little
nutty
and
brown
sugary
carbonation
is
gentle
on
the
palate
finish
is
somewhat
long
and
flavored
with
soft
baking
spices
pours
a
dark
semitransparent
mahogany
with
a
fairly
thick
if
not
persistent
beige
head
aroma
is
not
strong
but
fruity
and
yeasty
with
malt
underpinnings
rather
inviting
flavor
is
stronger
than
the
aroma
malty
and
yeasty
with
a
fruity
and
nutty
hints
and
just
a
touch
of
spice
texture
is
quite
rough
and
fizzy
leaving
a
tart
and
nippy
finish
drinkability
i
would
definitely
have
another
one
but
later
on
that
night
i
realized
why
this
is
caller
rigor
mortis
ha
the
bottle
says
this
beer
is
a
abbystyle
brown
ale
and
i
would
say
that
is
a
great
description
though
very
high
abv
for
a
brown
this
is
a
very
complex
and
great
tasting
beer
i
really
enjoyed
drinking
it
and
will
have
to
get
it
again
drinkability
10
is
pretty
big
so
more
then
one
would
be
too
many
good
quad
if
you
can
find
it
pick
it
up
smooths
out
after
13
down
drinking
well
for
how
ripe
it
is
looking
forward
to
cellaring
a
couple
of
these
for
years
down
the
road
the
aroma
on
this
one
was
somewhat
mild
but
it
increased
a
bit
once
it
warmed
considerably
ultimately
i
got
a
mild
but
pleasant
spiciness
from
the
aroma
with
some
possible
hints
of
alcohol
the
flavor
was
much
fuller
theres
some
sweetness
upfront
then
the
spiciness
kicks
in
and
theres
a
long
drawnout
combination
finish
im
definitely
getting
some
aventinuslike
flavors
which
for
me
is
a
good
thing
the
phenolics
in
this
brew
are
kept
on
the
light
side
and
the
spiciness
is
allowed
to
shine
this
brew
is
somewhat
sweet
but
certainly
not
cloying
theres
a
slight
alcohol
burn
in
the
finish
it
was
mostdrinkable
when
it
approached
room
termperature
the
bottle
did
say
it
was
best
to
age
this
beer
but
i
couldnt
wait
six
months
or
so
might
do
this
beer
some
good
whatever
the
case
i
really
enjoyed
this
beer
which
just
recently
showed
up
in
orlando
knightly
spirits
i
love
a
good
abbystyle
brew
but
more
often
than
not
im
disappointed
with
what
i
find
however
i
was
happily
impressed
with
this
one
nice
job
dieu
du
ciel
overall
a
good
beer
interesting
for
the
style
drinkable
but
not
too
many
at
this
abv
d
this
is
definitely
a
slow
sipper
for
sure
due
to
the
alcohol
overall
a
decent
beer
but
not
as
good
as
some
of
the
other
good
beers
from
this
brewery
d
not
a
huge
fan
good
but
a
little
thick
dont
think
i
need
more
than
one
at
the
moment
but
i
would
get
it
again
at
a
bar
d
as
far
as
quads
go
i
have
come
across
better
but
this
one
is
a
good
effort
nonetheless
id
look
forward
to
eventually
revisiting
it
perhaps
up
against
some
others
for
comparison
ah
this
really
warmed
me
up
and
its
good
and
strong
i
liked
to
see
how
the
alcohol
changes
after
aging
till
then
au
revoir
d
very
good
and
i
would
definitely
have
this
again
though
the
alcoholic
finish
is
a
bit
stronger
than
i
would
like
pours
a
three

fades
quickly
leaving
traces
of
lace
cloudy

color
light

the

warms
strong

some

i
love
this
brewery
i
love
this
style
but
i
only
like
this
beer
very
glad
to
see
the
dieu
du
ciel
beers
make
their
way
to
denver
pours
dark
brownish
red
with
tan
head
smells
sweet
caramelly
and
dried
dark
fruitish
taste
includes
the
above
as
well
as
candi
sugar
yeast
and
bread
very
good
my
quadloving
wife
is
also
enjoying
some
in
her
minicity
beer
store
glass
body
is
pretty
thick
with
medium
carbonation
quite
the
quad
d
good
but
waaaay
hotter
than
its
belgian
counterparts
bottle
pours
a
murky
brown
with
a
tiny
white
ring
of
head
aroma
of
belgian
yeast
spices
and
roasted
nuts
flavor
of
roasted
nuts
and
a
touch
of
roasted
malt
and
sweet
malt
not
boozy
per
se
just
very
warming
nice
abtquad
its
roasted
characteristics
make
it
stand
out
from
the
traditional
belgians
i
cant
wait
to
sample
some
of
the
other
dieu
de
ciel
beers
that
i
brought
back
with
me
pitch
black
and
takes
a
hard
pour
to
get
2
fingers
of
foam
that
drops
ever
so
slowly
rich
dark
fruit
nose
pungent
raisins
and
prunes
and
red
berries
sugary
sweet
grape
candy
sweet
on
the
tongue
as
well
with
massive
alcoholic
complexity
concord
grapes
and
boozy
finish
lowish
carbonation
and
light
body
this
is
a
big
big
beer
some
portlike
notes
and
a
little
bit
of
hops
just
for
balance
a
sipper
for
sure
frankly
very
challenging
to
the
palate
and
i
think
might
be
better
with
even
less
carbonation
sweet
but
not
too
sweet
and
loaded
with
flavour
drinkability
is
decent
its
a
bit
sweet
and
high
in
abv
but
worth
trying
for
those
who
like
quads
medium
bodied
with
a
nice
medium
level
of
carbonation
and
a
creamy
mouthfeel
not
bad
but
not
one
of
the
breweries
better
offerings
imo
worth
a
try
if
you
like
quads
though
drinkability
isnt
too
bad
for
a
10
5er
but
the
campfire
smokey
taste
really
throws
me
off
and
gets
a
bit
cloying
i
wish
i
could
access
more
of
the
dark
fruity
flavor
that
is
up
front
it
doesnt
help
that
the
smell
is
good
and
the
initial
taste
is
good
because
you
get
fairly
excited
only
to
be
let
down
id
recommend
skipping
this
one
and
trying
their
other
offerings
which
i
think
are
a
lot
better
in
case
youre
wondering
i
had
this
on
tap
as
well
and
felt
about
the
same
way
as
i
did
with
this
bottle
d
easy
to
drink
d
nice
taste
fun
to
sip
i
like
it
had
this
one
as
part
of
a
late
night
session
few
days
ago
poured
a
cloudy
brown
with
light
beige
head
that
left
very
little
lacing
smelled
of
fruity
yeast
and
light
malts
tasted
like
fruity
yeast
raisins
figs
bread
and
malt
smooth
but
slightly
overcarbonated
otherwise
very
easy
to
drink
pours
a
belgian
style
brown
color
with
a
decent
sized
white
head
that
slowly
disappears
smells
of
dark
fruits
sweet
malts
and
a
slight
alcohol
smell
tastes
of
sweet
plums
and
raisins
followed
by
a
spicy
after
taste
of
spices
i
cannot
identify
another
reviewer
mentioned
that
the
sweetness
is
eaten
up
by
the
hops
i
could
not
find
a
better
way
to
describe
this
flavor
which
does
indeed
balance
out
the
sweetness
of
this
beer
the
flavor
finishes
with
this
flavor
and
a
slight
alcohol
burn
the
mouthfeel
is
creamy
and
nicely
carbonated
this
beer
is
a
sipper
but
it
goes
down
easy
i
could
savor
one
of
these
for
hours
and
could
see
myself
drinking
this
again
and
again
but
i
could
not
see
myself
drinking
more
than
one
of
these
in
a
night
not
drinkable
this
beer
really
surprised
me
im
a
huge
fan
of
dieu
du
ciel
and
enjoy
many
of
their
beers
this
one
just
doesnt
live
up
to
their
standards
judging
from
the
majority
of
their
beers
maybe
i
spoiled
myself
by
trying
unibroue
17
last
night
for
the
first
time
that
beer
completely
blows
this
one
away
maybe
id
chug
one
or
two
of
these
to
get
a
good
buzz
going
if
they
were
free
i
hate
to
sound
like
im
trashing
this
beer
im
really
not
im
hoping
this
is
a
bad
bottle
this
is
really
disappointing
dieu
du
ciel
whats
up
a
good
beer
however
drinkability
suffers
from
the
high
abv
that
its
you
at
the
end
the
foam
was
wheat
in
color
a
little
bibbly
and
dissapated
quickly
the
color
was
dark
amber
mahogany
with
a
cola
undertone
the
smell
was
deep
almost
molassisy
overtone
hints
of
chocolate
and
a
hops
undertone
the
taste
was
exceptional
a
rich
molassis
overtone
with
a
choclatey
highlight
hints
of
wood
and
maple
and
a
rich
spicey
undertone
and
a
little
sharp
like
a
barley
wine
mouthfeel
deep
mediumbodied
drinkability
a
complex
variety
of
tastes
that
danced
in
my
mouth
wonderfull
bottle
poured
a
clear
deep
amber
color
ale
with
rather
large
foamy
head
with
good
retention
and
some
lacing
aroma
of
cookie
dough
with
sweet
belgian
malt
and
some
light
dry
fruits
taste
is
also
dominated
by
some
sweet
belgian
malt
some
candi
sugar
and
some
dry
figs
body
is
about
average
for
the
style
with
good
carbonation
and
no
apparent
alcohol
very
well
done
but
additional
complexity
and
more
dry
fruits
ester
would
have
benefited
this
one
rigor
mortis
is
pretty
good
beer
i
like
it
but
dont
love
it
its
not
competitive
with
the
finest
quads
out
there
but
its
a
pretty
good
one
the
nose
could
use
more
strength
and
alcohol
is
too
prominent
in
flavor
shore
those
two
shortcomings
up
and
youve
got
a
really
good
quad
nonetheless
ive
enjoyed
the
bottle
and
wouldnt
mind
picking
up
another
at
some
point
itd
be
interesting
to
see
how
it
is
with
a
little
age
on
it
grab
a
couple
if
you
bump
into
it
overall
a
very
nice
quad
that
should
age
nicely
pours
a
cloudy
brownish
copper
color
with
some
dark
amber
highlights
into
a
chalice
almost
two
fingers
of
foamy
khaki
colored
head
has
good
retention
and
leaves
some
lacing
that
falls
back
down
onto
the
top
smells
of
dark
fruits
toffee
chocolate
belgian
candy
pepper
clove
and
a
touch
of
ripe
bananas
tastes
of
dark
fruits
like
plums
grapes
cherries
and
prunes
followed
by
some
chocolate
molasses
bread
spices
and
candied
sugar
with
a
touch
of
earth
funk
and
alcohol
in
the
finish
medium
to
mediumfull
in
body
with
moderate
carbonation
smooth
and
really
sweet
this
is
a
great
quad
easy
to
drink
and
great
for
the
style
perhaps
it
is
a
little
too
sweet
but
overall
it
has
a
nice
complexity
and
is
enjoyable
pours
typical
dark
belgian
style
dark
brown
light
tan
almost
white
head
cool
lacing
left
by
intricate
little
bubbles
up
and
down
smells
almost
like
medicinal
alcohol
at
first
but
that
quickly
fades
way
to
sweet
malt
a
bit
but
not
a
ton
of
dark
fruit
flavour
is
equally
balanced
not
a
ton
of
sweet
dark
fruit
here
slightly
sweet
little
hop
presence
the
best
part
is
in
the
mouthfeel
while
it
doesnt
pack
a
ton
of
flavour
it
still
manages
to
be
coating
in
mouthfeel
it
just
feels
right
carbonation
is
perfect
drinkability
is
amazing
not
the
most
amazing
quad
out
there
but
still
a
great
experience
drinkability
quite
an
interesting
beer
havent
had
a
bad
or
even
mediorce
beer
from
this
place
at
5
99
it
was
worth
the
experiment
pours
a
clouded
brown
with
a
creme
head
nose
is
perfume
and
dough
tones
not
overly
complex
and
slightly
leaning
towards
one
dimensional
flavor
is
floral
dough
touches
of
fig
fruits
and
slight
sweetness
an
alcohol
burn
is
noticeably
present
more
so
as
time
goes
on
and
it
warms
feel
is
thick
enough
on
liquid
carbonation
is
middle
of
the
road
and
about
what
i
would
hope
to
see
overall
not
too
shabby
the
alcohol
is
a
bit
too
much
imo
especially
for
a
lower
abv
quad
but
it
definitely
works
for
the
style
as
many
interpretations
of
quads
have
a
difficult
time
doing
so
drinkability
this
is
not
dieu
du
ceils
best
but
i
will
not
disqualify
everything
from
the
brewery
by
a
long
shot
im
highly
impressed
with
this
beer
and
think
it
is
a
great
representation
of
the
style
leaning
heavily
to
the
sweeter
side
of
things
big
fan
needs
some
aging
but
otherwise
an
enjoyable
example
of
the
style
that
can
only
get
better
with
a
bit
of
age
translation
this
beer
is
bold
and
brash
right
now
i
think
it
would
do
for
some
time
to
calm
down
all
these
aggressive
fruits
and
booziness
but
to
be
honest
not
sure
if
that
will
ever
totally
happen

dark
fruit

mouthfeel
is
just
shy
of

with
a
pleasant
consistent
background
carbonation
nice
abbey
ale
that
changes
its
character
as
it
warms
this
beer
poured
a
very
dark
murky
dark
amber
almost
black
color
and
formed
a
light
tan
foamy
head
that
coated
the
glass
with
lace
as
it
slowly
subsided
an
aroma
of
malt
raisins
chocolate
and
belgian
yeasts
the
flavor
was
of
malt
chocolate
cocoa
coffee
and
bread
yeast
the
body
was
medium
light
and
the
finish
was
a
touch
sprite
yet
sweet
a
nice
beer
but
not
sure
what
style
to
place
it
under
a
sweet
beer
noticeably
potent
and
very
full
bodied
almost
as
if
an
unfermented
wort
was
blended
in
almost
candy
like
in
the
taste
the
swallow
features
a
spritzy
bitterness
that
fades
quickly
to
the
mouth
numbing
alcohol
content
which
is
overpowering
in
the
aftertaste
what
an
interesting
beer
the
nose
sort
of
leaves
something
to
be
desired
but
the
tastes
is
like
a
belgian
quad
with
the
volume
turned
to
11
the
meat
taste
just
makes
it
ludicrously
bizarre
i
like
it
on
tap
at
deep
ellum
allston
tonights
offering
was
a
2007
vintage
served
in
a
belgian
goblet
very
dark
brown
color
to
the
body
no
head
or
carbonation
smell
was
quite
a
pleasing
combination
of
dried
cherries
and
caramelized
sugar
there
was
also
a
distinct
smell
of
barrel
aging
that
i
noticed
taste
was
the
highlight
of
the
night
strong
but
smooth
the
smell
led
me
to
believe
that
his
beer
was
going
to
be
quite
potent
in
flavor
but
it
turned
out
to
be
quite
easy
to
drink
a
nice
example
of
a
quad
huge
bursts
of
fruit
flavor
with
a
sugary
sweetness
to
balance
the
alcohol
i
think
the
aging
certainly
helped
mellow
out
this
beer
a
bit
and
bring
some
of
the
core
flavors
to
the
forefront
went
great
with
a
hearty
plate
of
belgian
style
sausages
definitely
would
order
one
again
d
not
too
much
here
i
mean
it
is
a
very
good
brew
but
the
sweetness
just
kills
it
here
its
like
chocolate
its
good
but
after
a
bar
you
aint
gonna
get
another
one
but
the
first
one
is
gonna
go
down
like
no
other
so
one
goes
down
easy
two
is
good
three
is
getting
a
bit
too
much
alcohol
is
not
a
problem
here
since
it
is
so
well
hidden
pours
a
clear
reddish
orange

huge
and
thick

alcohol

isnt

mouthfeel
is
light

with
medium

some
warmth
from
the
alcohol
but
altogether
pretty
smooth
for
the
abv
a
nice
quad
i
could
drink
this
stuff
on
a
regular
basis
drinkability
is
decent
but
the
sweetness
detracts
slightly
from
this
its
mostly
balanced
initially
then
the
sweetness
begins
to
take
over
still
quite
nice
overall
just
a
little
more
of
a
sipper
which
might
be
best
with
something
at
this
abv
the
rigor
mortis
abt
was
born
in
our
montreal
brewpub
in
august
2001
this
is
a
pretty
big
quad
and
i
dont
think
it
drinks
too
well
young
it
wears
its
alcohol
and
sugar
content
proudly
but
comes
off
as
too
boozy
and
sweet
for
a
style
that
is
typically
boozy
and
sweet
this
is
really
too
bad
because
the
peripherals
appearance
aroma
mouthfeel
are
all
great
id
only
try
this
again
if
it
was
aged
overall
it
packs
a
punch
and
with
the
sweetness
and
alcohol
feel
i
see
this
one
appealing
to
those
who
like
port
i
enjoyed
it
but
i
was
also
glad
i
didnt
have
more
than
a
halfpint
at
the
brewpub
a
cross
between
a
belgium
and
an
old
ale
very
cloudy
amber
with
great
lacing
yeasty
aroma
full
mouthfeel
very
drinkable
and
tasty
the
clear
winner
here
tonight
some
chocolate
malt
some
smoke
had
again
three
years
later
although
not
as
good
had
this
beer
on
tap
at
the
dieu
de
ciel
brewpub
only
available
in
750ml
bottles
not
available
for
takeaway
as
of
yet
this
beer
will
whoop
your
ass
very
strong
raisiny
with
rummy
plum
undertones
two
finger
head
upon
pourth
i
loved
this
beer
but
could
only
drink
half
of
the
bottle
due
to
the
strong
abv
that
is
very
present
highly
recommended
chris
a
dark
brown
color
with
ruby
high
lights
taste
reminds
me
of
anise
chocolate
plum
juice
some
chilly
porto
on
the
nose
it
smells
like
funky
grapes
and
roasted
bread
with
notes
of
cola
vinious
warming
alcohol
present
very
enjoyable
easily
drinkable
a
musttry
pours
very
dark
brown
almost
opaque
with
a
short
medium
creamy
head
good
lacing
nose
consists
of
a
strong
alcohol
astringent
smell
along
with
a
myriad
of
fruits
berries
perhaps
grapes
and
something
else
some
may
also
akin
the
smell
to
hamster
piss
because
of
its
overwhelming
alcoholness
taste
is
very
strong
with
some
heavy
malts
mixed
fruits
caramel
and
again
the
intense
alcohol
i
realized
its
a
rather
highoctane
brew
but
i
like
highoctane
without
the
super
astringency
like
trois
pistoles
for
example
mouthfeel
was
good
for
the
brews
strength
this
would
not
be
a
choice
again
if
i
was
in
the
mood
for
a
highoctane

herbal

dark
port

and
more
i
also
picked
up
hints
of
coffee
chocolate
and
caramel
the
taste
was
more
of
the
same
fruity
up
front
with
some
nice
malts
in
the
middle
and
the
herbal
hops
in
the
finish
the
chocolate
and
coffee
flavors
were
hidden
within
this
beer
as
well
the
mouthfeel
was
very
thick
and
filling
but
just
right
for
an
abt
and
the
drinkability
was
also
awesome
for
an
abt
a
great
belgianstyle
beer
and
a
truly
wonderful
example
of
the
brewers

at
work

possibly
one

sticky
roasted

i
enjoyed
the
finish
but
it
was
perhaps
a
little
unbalanced
on
the
sweet
side
strongly
recommended
could
be
one
of
dieu
du
ciels
best
overall
a
solid
barrelaged
quad
nothing
stands
out
from
other
examples
its
just
complex
and
tasty
pours
a
brown
body
with
one
finger
head
with
one
finger
head
and
minimal
lace
a
aroma
that
comes
across
as
a
little
bit
of
dark
fruit
more
toffee
and
raisins
than
anything
and
a
hint
of
sugar
and
spice
smooth
medium
body
yeast
keeps
it
smooth
while
adding
a
little
chewiness
the
dark
fruits
come
out
as
i
get
raisins
figs
toffee
and
there
is
even
a
little
bit
of
booze
in
the
finish
spicy
edge
gives
it
a
little
depth
and
adds
balance
and
overall
a
pretty

an
excellent
a
monks
brew
is
certainly
not
the
best
quad
ive
ever
had
but
its
still
a
pretty
damn
good
one
i
love
the
flavour
profile
of
this
one
but
unfortunately
it
suffers
from
a
few
forgiveable
flaws
namely
the
relatively
limp
mouthfeel
and
comparatively
straightforward
bouquet
like
all
mikkeller
beers
this
is
not
a
cheap
tipple
but
going
by
the
typical
price
point
of
an
imported
quad
its
certainly
not
unreasonably
expensive
for
this
market
very
good
stuff
and
definitely
worth
a
try
for
any
bsdaquad
fans
but
not
worldclass
overall
decent
but
with
so
many
world
class
quads
out
there
not
much
reason
to
have
this
one
again
it
seems
a
little
amateurish
when
you
stack
it
up
against
bernardusrochefortchimay
etc
overall
this
was
a
satisfying
dessertlike
quad
very
assertive
strength
and
yeasty
spiciness
while
it
maintains
a
satisfying
drinkability
i
feel
it
lacks
the
finesse
of
some
premier
belgian
examples
this
at
least
young
has
an
assertive
rich
fruit
character
with
more
cinnamonnutmegpepper
spice
developing
to
carry
through
to
a
dry
finish
with
sticky
caramel
throughout
enjoyable
and
i
hope
to
see
it
develop
some
complexity
and
nuance

this
is
a
good
abbey
style
quad
much
better
than
the
usual
american
craft
versions
of
the
style
definitely
worth
checking
out
i
wouldnt
call
this
a
conventional
quad
the
roasted
malty
flavor
and
lighter
lesscarbonated
mouthfeel
combined
with
the
usual
fruit
and
spice
make
this
beer
feel
more
like
a
blend
of
a
quad
and
stout
its
highly
drinkable
and
enjoyable
but
i
prefer
a
quad
to
be
slightly
less
sweet
and
to
have
a
fuller
body
worth
trying
but
i
wouldnt
go
out
of
my
way
to
pick
it
up
again
as
its
more
expensive
than
some

o
this
bad
boy
has
been
in
my
closet
for
about
2
years
and
i
kept
forgetting
about
it
glad
i
finally
pulled
it
out
and
enjoyed
it
slightly
oxidized
but
overall
a
great
beer
i
really
enjoyed
the
dark
fruits
spices
and
rum
mingled
into
the
yeasty
backdrop
hmmmm
not
terrible
but
certainly
subpar
it
looks
great
however
the
aroma
and
flavour
have
a
lack
of
depth
and
development
the
overall
character
is
wishywashy
sweet
and
fruity
but
not
fully
committed
body
is
ok
but
not
amazing
my
impression
is
that
it
is
underattenuated
possibly
due
to
not
being
fermented
at
a
sufficiently
high
temperature
it
falls
short
of
the
best
that
the
style
can
offer
no
need
to
hunt
it
down
overall
this
is
excessively
sweet
not
even
a
caramelly
sweetness
or
brown
sugar
just
lots
of
unexciting
sugar
overall
a
very
solid
example
of
a
belgian
quad
delicious
this
one
stays
with
you
for
a
while
chewy
mouthfeel
but
not
overly
syrupy
a
lot
is
going
on
and
a
lot
is
done
very
well
o
pretty
good
quad
a
little
heavier
and
darker
than
some
of
my
normal
faves
seems
a
bit
more
like
a
bsda
it
was
one
i
wanted
to
try
but
would
be
10deep

my
list
of
quads
that
i
would
seek
out
at
the
store
750

at

is

with
only
a
small

noticed
after

still
definitely
a

overall
this
is
an
excellent
quadrupel

great

of

very
smooth

a

this
ages
very
nicely
d
really
nicely
balanced
quad
with
a
great
mouthfeel
great
yeast
character
really
interesting
and
surprising
beer
it
smells
sour
but
when
you
taste
it
it
is
just
like
someone
added
just
a
few
lemon
drops
i
hope
they
did
not
target
to
do
a
copy
of
belgian
quads
which
is
not
mikkellers
style
i
believe
they
just
got
a
base
to
brew
something
new
and
challenging
definitely
worth
a
try
overall
this
is
a
really
interesting
quad
in
some
ways
it
tastes
a
lot
like
a
belgian
strong
dark
ale
as
it
lacks
the
sweetness
ive
had
in
other
quads
though
its
certainly
got
the
alcohol
very
tasty
beer
very
highly
recommended
yet
another
brilliant
and
distinct
beer
from
mikkeller
the
king
as
far
as
i
am
concerned
this
one
pours
really
dark
chalky
black
in
color
with
some
dark
brown
yeast
floaters
and
a
two
inch
white
head
with
wonderful
retention
the
nose
is
alcoholic
for
sure
dark
malts
but
not
bitter
and
toasty
sort
of
mineral
rich
volcanic
in
some
way
the
yeast
is
spicy
and
bright
but
not
overbearing
its
somehow
delicate
in
such
a
massive
brew
in
the
flavor
i
pick
up
something
sweet
but
not
sugary
kind
of
like
the
birch
syrup
beers
but
to
a
lesser
degree
really
awesome
malt
profile
earthy
and
lighter
despite
its
color
alcohol
is
invisible
until
it
warms
and
the
yeast
is
classically
belgian
while
also
adding
some
interesting
fruity
elements
to
an
otherwise
black
beer
feel
is
lovely
too
great
carbonation
velvety
glide
down
the
throat
and
a
full
body
that
remains
super
drinkable
overall
this
is
a
perfect
example
of
what
a
belgian
strong
dark
ale
can
be
and
its
one
i
had
no
problem
dirnking
a
750ml
of
despite
its
10
abv
this
was
a
special
treat
i
cant
remember
what
the
cost
of
this
one
was
and
i
guess
that
will
determine
if
i
buy
a
couple
to
age
not
up
there
with
the
trappist
versions
but
a
respectable
beer
for
sure
pours
a
clear
dark
brown
with
a
foamy
dark
khaki
head
that
settles
to
wisps
of
film
on
top
of
the
beer
small
dots
of
lace
form
around
the
glass
on
the
drink
down
smell
is
of
malt
brown
sugar
caramel
dark
fruit
alcohol
and
some
slight
spice
aromas
taste
is
much
the
same
with
a
medium
amount
of
spice
bitterness
on
the
palate
with
each
sip
this
beer
has
a
good
level
of
carbonation
with
a
crisp
mouthfeel
overall
this
is
a
pretty
good
beer
with
a
great
aroma
but
the
flavors
just
dont
match
up
very
well
this
is
a
special
brew
worth
seeking
out
o
poor
effort
would
not
have
again
not
recommended
and
not
sure
i
want
to
finish
the
whole
beer
im
sad
but
this
is
mikkeller
you
lose
some
you
win
most
very
enjoyable
stuff
jd
overall
a
very
light
refreshing
dark
ale
i
dont
believe
thats
something
ive
thought
about
the
style
before
simple
nothing
unexpected
going
on
but
what
it
does
it
does
with
style
and
depth
it
also
goes
down
too
easily
if
anything
id
definitely
spring
on
the
barrelaged
version
if
i
ever
see
it
highly
recommended
great
quad
dark
and
full
of
bold
dark
fruit
id
give
it
6
months
to
tame
the
booziness
though
o
nothing
to
rave
about
here
just
a
good
midroad
quad
that
offers
nothing
new
or
something
you
cant
live
without
od
a
really
nice
quad
maybe
too
sweet
but
tasty
all
the
way
through
and
had
nothing
to
complain
about
b
overall
its
a
good
quad
but
has
the
above
issues
stick
to
st
bernardus
or
rochefort
pours
a
dark
brown
color
w
a
one
finger
cocoa
head
good
lacing
on
my
snifter
glass
very
dark
and
impossible
to
see
through
the
nose
is
grapes
prunes
apple
caramel
malt
and
some
spices
really
well
done
the
taste
profile
is
very
similar
w
warming
really
bringing
out
the
richness
in
this
brew
feel
is
medium
with
malt
sweetness
carrying
the
day
no
evidence
of
the
10
abv
here
and
a
nice
lighter
than
expected
finish
overall
this
is
a
fantastic
beer
although
it
might
be
more
of
a
bsda
than
a
quad
i
will
definitely
look
for
this
one
again
i
enjoyed
it
cheers
o
this
is
an
ok
quad
nothing
more
nothing
less
if
youre
a
fan
of
the
style
you
may
find
that
this
is
not
offensive
but
also
offers
nothing
remotely
new
as
it
warmed
up
i
got
more
out
of
it
some
plum
coffee
and
chocolate
i
just
wasnt
getting
before
growing
on
me
slightly
but
still
not
something
i
will
revisit
a
rich
belgian
strong
ale
with
lots
of
great
flavour
this
is
certainly
a
brooding
belgian
rather
than
a
brighter
one
overall
a
really
nice
dessert
beer
final
thought
try
this
one
for
sure
love
these
brewers
overall
i
am
not
a
fan
of
this
quad
and
to
be
honest
it
might
be
my
least
favorite
of
the
style
to
date
overall
this
was
a
decent
beer
nothing
impressive
o
quads
are
my
favourite
style
of
beer
and
im
always
interested
to
try
new
ones
so
often
im
disappointed
but
this
is
superb
it
is
quintessentially
belgian
has
all
the
dark
fruit
characteristics
and
hides
the
alcohol
masterfully
a
must
try
and
drink
at
room
temp
overall
this
is
a
decent
and
surprisingly
drinkable
quad
given
the
abv
enjoyable
and
at
3
cant
beat
it
this
was
an
ok
quadrupel
something
im
glad
to
have
tried
but
dont
feel
an
amazing
need
to
revisit
again
its
probably
hard
to
produce
this
particular
fruit
note
from
a
beer
but
it
just
comes
out
as
thinly
sweet
and
underfermented
just
not
very
enjoyable
too
much
sugar
in
the
wort
this
smells
like
a
fermented
out
sugardrink
its
heavy
hot
and
unpleasant
this
is
not
a
great
beer
and
worse
its
a
beer
that
gives
the
great
examples
of
this
style
a
bad
name
poor
effort
mikkeller
raw
a
bit
alcoholic
but
very
interesting
and
probably
with
a
big
potential
in
5
10
years
the
brew
pours
a
deep
mahogany
hue
with
nice
carbonation
that
leaves
behind
a
caramel
laced
two
finger
head
and
lacing
everywherethe
smell
is
mainly
alcohol
and
candyit
has
a
medium
bodied
syrupy
mouthfeel
which
leaves
your
lips
sticky
and
has
tastes
of
boiled
candybrown
sugarmedicinal
hopsalcohol
and
finished
with
a
barley
sugar
sweetness
and
overall
its
alright
and
definately
hides
a
powerful
punch
behind
its
sweetness
pours
a
deep
dark
mahogany
with
about
three
fingers
of
head
fading
moderately
fast
with
plenty
of
lacing
initial
whiff
of
aroma
is
reminiscent
of
belgian
candies
figs
licorice
and
peppery
alcohol
the
taste
is
similar
to
that
expected
from
the
aroma
along
with
a
sweet
malty
caramel
flavor
and
a
touch
of
banana
and
biscuit
moderate
body
and
sweet
throughout
the
mouth
with
a
refreshing
bubbly
swallow
and
a
tinge
of
pepper
and
alcohol
in
the
finish
a
talented
brewery
producing
a
well
developed
drink
with
plenty
of
potential
d
in
general
this
is
an
all
around
good
drinkable
beer
o
overall
i
am
pretty
surprised
at
the
quality
of
this
beer
great
aroma
good
taste
missing
some
of
the
complexity
of
the
very
best
quads
this
is
one
that
i
would
definitely
seek
out
again
i
like
that
it
is
a
touch
on
the
sweet
side
the
beer
is
dark
chestnut
brown
with
a
quarter
inch
of
beige
head
the
aroma
brings
alcohol
malt
yeast
respectively
the
taste
is
earthy
with
an
understated
yeast
flavor
as
well
as
a
healthy
amount
of
rich
malt
silky
smooth
on
the
palate
with
alcohol
well
hidden
the
feel
is
delicate
and
impressive
a
good
quad
i
would
have
it
again
draft
at
gourmet
haus
staudt
cloudy
rusty
brown
the
head
pours
small
but
creamy
and

a

nose
sweet
licorice
star
anise
sweet
sugary
malt
and
dark

prevalent
on
the

alcohol
is
noticeable
and
lends
a

the

more

the

suggests
peppery

a
bit

medium

a
bit
roasty

spiciness
a
decent

but
too
boozy
to
be
really
enjoyable
d
quads
rule
and
mikkeller
rules
so
of
course
this
beer
rules
nuff
said
get
this
d
was
really
in
the
mood
for
a
quad
tonight
at
first
my
nose
told
me
this
would
be
too
sweet
then
my
initial
first
sip
told
me
it
was
too
bitter
then
when
my
tastes
buds
dug
into
the
beer
it
really
became
the
beer
that
i
was
hoping
to
enjoy
tonight
the
creaminess
and
body
are
like
many
classics
and
the
flavor
although
on
the
bitter
side
really
hit
the
mark
this
is
a
solid
beer
in
a
style
where
this
is
stiff
competition
md
there
is
a
medium
amount
of
carbonation
in
this
bottle
but
it
just
seems
flat
and
watery
not
a
good
representation
of
a
quad
at
all
nothing
complex
it
seems
like
there
is
no
cohesiveness
with
the
flavors
they
dont
mix
well
together
and
none
of
them
stand
very
well
on
their
own
not
a
drainpour
but
not
a
very
good
beer
either
opinion
this
is
a
very
good
beer
i
dont
know
how
much
it
fits
into
the
quad
category
versus
the
strong
dark
category
i
would
put
it
in
the
latter
as
it
holds
up
against
some
of
the
great
beers
like
st
bernardus
abt
12
and
the
likes
so
this
is
not
a
beer
to
be
taken
lightly
that
said
i
prefer
the
blatant
drinkability
that
you
get
with
some
of
the
other
strong
darks
over
this
one
as
this
has
a
relatively
assertive
dark
malt
character
that
isnt
quite
as
quaffable
as
it
is
adding
acidity
and
a
burnt
toffee
note
that
slows
down
the
whole
drinking
process
either
way
this
is
a
very
good
beer
and
i
would
recommend
that
you
pick
one
up
and
try
it
for
yourself
it
is
good
enough
that
it
just
may
be
your
beer
d
this
is
very
drinkable
and
quite
enjoyable
to
boot
its
sweet
and
fruity
and
overall
really
good
thanks
jeff
d
a
nice
above
average
quad
would
like
to
have
again
d
does
a
great
job
of
hiding
the
10
abv
its
smoothness
and
great
flavor
keep
you
coming
back
till
its
gone
d
really
drinkable
quad
quite
enjoyable
d
kind
of
sweet
and
pretty
high
abv
drinkability
would
depend
on
how
you
like
the
sweetness
pours
a
modest
brown
color
with
a
short
head
and
a
tiny
amount
of
lacing
the
smell
is
quite
nice
with
a
mixture
of
dark
fruits
as
well
as
fresh
grapes
a
slight
boozy
character
the
taste
loses
most
of
that
fresh
fruit
character
and
instead
there
is
simply
some
light
sweetness
and
a
bit
of
dark
fruits
the
mouthfeel
is
incredibly
light
more
so
than
any
belgian
dark
ive
come
across
drinkability
is
severely
affected
by
this
and
the
fact
that
theres
not
all
that
much
to
the
taste
this
is
a
very
good
beer
it
is
very
smooth
and
inviting
this
has
a
very
pleasant
flavor
that
will
make
you
want
more
it
is
not
hoppy
like
other
mikkellers
there
is
a
very
slight
sweetness
in
with
the
slightbitter
finish
note
to
self
rereview
this
beer
in
a
state
of
lower
inebriation
and
in
a
more
private
setting
complex
and
tasty
brew
not
quite
as
smooth
as
some
of
its
more
established
brethren
but
a
damn
good
quad
for
a
change
of
pace
skål
not
quite
its
thinner
on
teh
palate
than
it
should
be
especially
being
that
sweet
i
suppose
its
the
high
alcohol
that
does
that
at
least
the
beer
isnt
hot
it
kind
of
tastes
like
melt
caramel
in
beer
form
carbonation
is
low
in
the
mouth
its
way
way
too
sweet
for
me
not
feeling
it
there
are
quads
infinitely
better
than
this
overall
i
wasnt
a
huge
fan
of
this
beer
as
it
seemed
heavy
on
the
malt
side
and
the
fruit
flavors
werent
as
well
integrated
as
the
better
beers
of
the
style
still
its
a
solid
beer
and
its
worth
a
shot
to
see
for
yourself
mouth
feel
is
quite
good
with
alcohol
hidden
drinkability
is
good
d
not
nearly
as
complex
as
most
of
the
better
quads
which
happen
to
be
one
of
my
favorite
styles
it
was
easy
to
get
down
for
10
and
id
have
it
again
just
to
gaze
at
its
appearance
d
this
was
absolutely
fantastic
with
tons
of
complexity
and
rich
flavors
it
had
amazing
body
too
and
hid
the
alcohol
like
crazy
so
it
was
infinitely
easy
to
drink
reminiscent
of
van
de
keizer
blue
which
is
one
of
my
favorite
dark
belgian
ales
ever
this
could
maybe
improve
with
age
but
i
already
love
it
fresh
one
easydrinking
quad
if
a
bit
simplistic
if
there
ever
was
such
a
thing
despite
my
description
this
is
perhaps
a
bit
more
complex
than
that
but
the
focus
really
seems
to
be
more
on
the
clean
smooth
tasty
and
imperceptible
strength
of
this
offering
good
stuff
even
for
the
price
which
for
the
vessel
in
question
is
indeed
a
veritable
bargain
hey
you
could
do
a
lot
worse
than
drinking
a
mikkeller

if
youve
been
wondering
i

with

i
thoroughly
enjoyed
this
quad
the
nose
didnt
live
up
to
the
taste
but
thatd
be
my
biggest
complaint
great
complex
flavor
awesome
mouthfeel
a
case
of
this
could
probably
last
forever
but
a
4
pack
would
be
a
great
pickup
not
bad
the
main
thing
this
beer
had
going
for
it
was
a
distinctly
nutty
aftertaste
which
i
found
interesting
other
than
that
it
kinda
tastes
like
normal
beer
which
isnt
bad
at
all
but
i
was
expecting
a
much
more
complicated
flavor
from
a
quadrupel
o
this
is
a
winner
for
sure
nice
take
on
the
style
that
is
different
than
the
trappists
taste
definitely
a
sipper
strong
alcohol
is
notable
but
not
overwheliming
some
obviously
hints
of
chocolate
and
caramel
well
balanced
drinkability
a
nice
beer
in
the
belgian
style
quadrupel
overall
a
great
brew
but
not
quite
as
refined
as
the
elite
of
the
style
the
aroma
needs
some
sophistication
the
taste
could
use
a
bit
more
complexity
and
the
carbonation
is
plainly
just
off
overall
slightly
to
bitter
for
my
taste
with
a
huge

warmth
finish
i
have
another
bottle
of
this
that
i
am
saving

time
will
help

of
the

alcohol
reminds
me
of
the
pannepeut
but
a
little
more
refined
this
was
a
pretty
flavorful
beer
the
alcohol
presence
is
overpowering
at
times
but
it
is
still
tasty
poured
from
a
33cl
bottle
into
a
goblet
coded
bottle
date
this
pours
a
cloudy
yeast
filled
tea
brown
color
with
a
small
thin
tan
head
which
quickly
dissipates
to
a
thin
film
the
smells
are
very
fruity
and
malty
you
get
a
load
of
ripe
dark
fruit
some
cherries
a
little
belgian
funk
and
brown
sugar
the
feel
is
medium
with
a
creamy
high
carbonination
the
taste
is
good
enough
the
alcohol
is
very
present
and
you
get
some
heat
besides
that
there
are
dark
fruit
candied
sugar
malts
poured
at
a
good
temperature
with
a
nice
creamcolored
head
that
slowly
settled
color
is
a
clear
red
amber
with
lots
of
bubble
trails
aroma
is
malt
fruit
a
bit
of
brandy
flavors
like
nose
mainly
sweet
with
some
back
tang
and
bitter
also
hint
of
fish
body
and
carbonation
are
good
finish
is
like
flavor
boozy
and
of
average
length
i
employed
a
very
gentle
pour
as
lees
were
visible
in
the
bottom
of
the
bottle
this
resulted
in
a
dearth
of
head
but
a
very
clean
deepamber
liquid
with
nequality
clarity
nose
had
a
dried
darkfruitiness
to
it
like
prunes
raisins
and
figs
very
apropos
for
this
time
of
the
year
there
was
also
a
yeastdriven
mustiness
and
a
definite
alcohol
burn
noticeable
on
the
nose
mouthfeel
was
medium
and
my
first
thought
was
brown
sugar
thanks
to
it
s
massive
malt
presence
on
the
tongue
phew
next
i
got
some
real
heat
from
the
alcohol
and
once
that
passed
the
fruity
esters
really
asserted
themselves
warming
the
fruitiness
became
even
more
prevalent
and
so
did
the
heat
the
finish
was
extremely
dry
thanks
to
the
yeast
really
having
done
its
job
i
would
bet
that
there
was
not
much
in
the
way
of
fermentable
sugars
when
all
was
said
and
done
my
my
my
many
thanks
for
the
hookup
overall
very
tasty
very
much
a
sipper
and
quite
good
not
the
best
quad
but
i
would
never
refuse
a
glass
of
this
wellaged
bottle
2
years
old
a
local
store
had
them
on
clearance
for
1
99
each
so
i
grabbed
a
few
cloudy
dark
amber
with
two
fingers
of
creamy
khaki
head
nice
and
rich
while
maintaining
a
quenching
dryness
toffee
gingerbread
plums
figs
and
slightly
charred
sugar
mild
hop
bitterness
puts
the
balance
toward
the
malt
side
alcohol
is
noticeable
but
lends
just
a
subtle
warming
quality
that
is
quite
pleasant
on
a
fall
evening
overall
a
solid
drinkable
quad

a

minimal

of
sweet

belgian
spicing
medium
bodied
with
some
creaminess
dark
and
sweet

malt
somewhat
dry
at
the
very
first

into

sweet
and
dry

very
complex
and
tasty
alcohol
a
bit
forward
detracting
from
the
overall
experience
still
a
very
nice
and
tasty
quad
overall
its
really
a
little
bit
too
sweet
for
me
but
certainly
different
and
interesting
pours
a
ruddy
amber
color
into
my
belgian
glass
with
a
1
off
white
foamy
head
some
haziness
great
lacing
as
the
beer
went
down
the
nose
of
this
one
is
very
citrusy
with
tangerine
lemon
and
sweet
grapefruit
notes
to
it
when
drank
a
huge
malt
flavor
dominates
with
sweet
candy
apple
dark
fruits
raisin
and
fig
molasses
and
cherries
very
yeasty
as
well
with
only
a
slight
spiciness
the
abv
is
warming
yet
perceived
as
not
too
boozy
its
full
bodied
and
it
coats
the
palate
very
well
overall
i
would
say
this
is
very
tasty
and
enjoyable
but
not
on
the
same
tier
as
say
the
st
bernadeus
abt
12
or
rochefort
could
use
some
more
balanced
complexity
as
this
is
primarily
just
very
sweet
and
fruitier
than
the
other
quads
i
have
had
original
review
on
07192010
served
from
tap
into
a
trappe
door
tulip
poured
redorange
with
a
two
finger
offwhite
head
that
subsided
to
one
finger
very
slowly
maintained
phenomenal
lacing
throughout
the
glass
the
aroma
was
comprised
of
sweet
malt
bread
fruit
spices
and
vanilla
the
flavor
was
of
sweet
malt
fruit
dark
chocolate
bread
wood
and
vanilla
it
had
a
light
feel
on
the
palate
with
mild
carbonation
which
gave
it
an
almost
creamy
texture
overall
this
was
a
pretty
decent
brew
to
be
honest
there
were
quite
a
few
notes
that
i
was
not
expecting
in
this
one
the
vanilla
note
was
definitely
the
biggest
surprise
to
me
granted
it
did
add
a
nice
touch
to
the
other
flavors
there
but
it
just
felt
a
little
lackluster
overall
to
me
while
good
it
just
felt
a
little
off
to
be
labeled
as
a
good
brew
worth
trying
if
you
get
the
chance
but
that
is
about
it

that

to
a

slight
spotty

with
no

at

medium
carbonation
and
full
bodied
with
a
very
creamy
and
slick
mouthfeel
that
is
fantastic
very
smooth
to
drink
but
is
still
definitely
a
sipper
alcohol
is
extremely
well
hidden
with
only
a
slight
warming
after
the
finish
noticed
overall
this
is
an
outstanding
quad
big
flavor
complexity
and
balance
very
smooth
and
highly
enjoyable
to
sip
on
this
is
definitely
an
afterdinner
type
sipper
or
a
dessert
beer
but
it
is
still
balanced
and
drinkable
despite
its
high
abv
and
complexity
i
would
reccommed
this
to
anyone
who
likes
big
beers
or
belgian
strong
darks
might
be
my
favorite
urthel
beer
so
far
im
sorry
but
this
just
isnt
my
style
im
not
sure
what
else
to
say
i
hate
to
give
a
rating
thats
so
below
the
average
but
if
i
dont
like
it
what
the
heck
else
am
i
supposed
to
do
o
good
for
a
quad
but
im
not
in
love
o
delicious
beer
with
a
distinctive
flavor
o
this
is
on
my
upper
quad
tier
with
bernardus
12
westy
12
and
pannepot
id
love
to
throw
this
into
a
blind
tasting
with
those
and
let
them
fight
to
the
death
overall
this
beer
is
so
good
if
youre
a
fan
of
big
belgian
beers
little
sweeter
than
a
rochefort
8
but
more
hoppy
than
a
sweet
barley
wine
a
beer
well
worth
checking
out
and
well
worth
its
price

big

with

dried

and
fig
theres
higher
alcohol
but
not
to
the
point
of
distraction
and
a
fairly
long
fruity
finish
this
holds
up
against
many
other
quads
othe
smell
is
better
than
the
taste
experience
lacks
malt
backbone
and
is
overburdened
with
the
high
alcohol
ill
give
it
a
try
after
it
sits
in
the
cellar
for
a
couple
years
smell
of
banana
taste
is
good
no
questions
about
that
a
bit
sweet

that
is
what
most
quads
have

is
very

smoth
low
attenuation

low

but
slooow
sipping
no
session
beer
seems
a
little
bit
oxidized
notes
of
prickly
booze
baked
apples
cocoa
nutmeg
cinnamon
sticks
and
clove
that
numb
the
tongue
sweet
and
sticky
on
the
lips
overripe
fruit
and
spiced
apples
soaked
in
brandy
a
bit
dry
and
fusely
in
the
aftertaste
cant
really
get
down
with
this
the
booze
is
more
than
apparent
though
somewhat
appropriate
for
a
quad
going
to
sip
for
a
bit
to
see
if
it
changes
at
all
served
around
50º
its
not
making
a
good
impression
harsh
alcohol
overly
sweet
unbalanced
not
planning
to
revisit
this
this
poured
out
as
a
nice
looking
brown
color
with
a
good
looking
head
on
top
the
retention
wasnt
too
bad
but
there
wasnt
much
lacing
the
smell
of
the
beer
is
a
little
sweet
and
had
some
nice
light
caramel
aromas
and
dark
fruits
the
taste
is
a
little
tart
upfront
but
settles
into
a
nice
sweet
and
rich
vanilla
like
aftertaste
the
mouthfeel
of
this
beer
is
nice
as
well
it
had
a
solid
carbonation
to
it
and
a
soft
mellow
feel
to
it
overall
this
was
a
pretty
nice
quad
doesnt
beat
la
trappe
but
still
very
nice
overall
not
rally
digging
this
one
alcohol
too
strong
too
sweet
needs
work
o
not
bad
well
put
together
a
bit
more
sweetness
would
do
the
beer
good
quite
a
different
quadruple
maintains
the
complexity
that
you
would
expect
but
differs
from
the
trappist
examples
the
bitterness
helps
with
this
it
is
not
a
bitterness
that
you
associate
with
hops
but
one
that
goes
perfect
with
the
dry
fruity
flavors
of
the
beer
very
enjoyable

urthel
samaranth
has
all
the
rich

and
sensual
qualities
that
have
made
the
quad
legendary
in
the
beer
world
it
is
for
my
money
every
bit
as
good
as
the
household
names
and
definitely
deserves
more
limelight
than
its
currently
given
this
is
one
import
worth
the
extra
few
dollars
youd
be
hardpressed
to
find
such
quality
from
nonbelgian
brewers
a
tad
hot
a
decent
brew
but
nothing
to
get
too
excited
about
i
think
ill
stick
to
hopit
i
like
it
not
a
session
beer
but
not
meant
to
be
very
nice
o
this
beer
has
some
nice
flavors
but
not
a
great
deal
of
depth
and
a
pleasant
alcohol
that
works
with
the
soft
sweetness
overall
a
very
good
beer
a
little
on
the
strong
side
for
me
and
better
for
winter
but
something
id
wholeheartedly
recommend

as

nothing

the

a

dr
covers
up
its
high
abv
very
well
you
could
easily
down
it
because
of
how
good
it
is
i
did
give
this
one
a
go
lads
you
wont
be
disappointed
id
love
to
try
this
ontap
overall
a
decent
quad
with
a
lot
of
solid
flavors
i
dig
it
i
really
enjoyed
all
of
the
fruit
flavors
here
i
understand
that
the
koenigshoeven
quad
was
the
original
inspiration
for
this
and
they
are
quite
similar
this
one
impresses
me
as
a
bit
spicier
and
not
quite
as
sweet
but
variety
is
a
good
thing
and
i
wouldnt
fault
either
for
not
being
the
other
this
one
also
seems
far
more
complex
in
the
flavor
profile
and
id
give
it
five
and
a
half
on
taste
if
i
could
luscious
stuff
makes
this
quadlover
plenty
happy
indeed
not
the
king
of
quads
but
a
good
quad
since
i
also
have
great
acces
to
rochefort
st
bernardus
and
even
westvleteren
i
dont
see
myself
picking
up
this
one
more
often
very
dangerously
drinkable
good
mouthfeel
and
nice
tingle
certainly
will
buy
this
beer
again
and
will
add
one
to
my
collection
to
be
aged
great
job
pours
a

nice

smell

not
crazy
about
the

taste
is

of
licorice

mint
alcohol
maybe
some
clove
thrown
in
mouthfeel
is
clean
w

aftertaste
not
the
normal
quad
this
is
definitely
different
than
anything
in
this
style
that
ive
had
pretty
good
but
not
great
some
of
my
buddies
really
liked
this
one
more
than
me
glad
i
got
to
try
this
beer
d
an
outstanding
quad
with
unique
hoppiness
this
beer
is
full
bodied
with
a
lovely
creamy
mouthfeel
a
worthy
component
in
the
land
of
quadrupels
md
really
easy
to
drink
despite
the
high
abv
and
almost
cloying
sweetness
a
good
beer
to
try
at
least
once
d
quite
drinkable
for
the
abv
which
is
only
occasionally
noticeable
a
good
quad
but
not
the
best
i
would
drink
it
again
certainly
but
i
hesitate
to
recommend
it
above
more
worthy
competitors
d
i
am
trying
to
explore
more
imported
beers
so
i
picked
this
one
up
honstly
i
will
never
pay
money
for
it
again
d
very
drinkable
for
an
11
beer
almost
scary
the
sweetness
is
there
but
it
really
doesnt
build
up
to
a
point
of
unpleasantness
d
fairly
good
quad
first
that
i
have
had
that
was
fairly
bitter
overall
pretty
average
drinking
quad
not
the
best
on
the
market
but
still
pretty
good
i
really
like
this
selection
and
like
chimay
another
one
of
my
favorites
i
often
overlook
it
because
im
always
on
that
quest
for
the
perfect
ale
but
i
should
opt
for
it
more
often
definitely
my
favorite
urthel
drink
is
decent
some
booze
but
better
than
11
dry
finish
bit
of
bitterness
nice
this
is
the
oddest
quad
ive
had
to
date
it
reminds
me
more
of
a
heavier
triple
theres
alot
going
on
in
this
beer
very
complex
yet
incredibly
drinkable
i
loved
it
its
almost
if
there
was
ingredients
in
this
beer
that
ive
never
tasted
before
bad
news
not
overly
complex
color
and
profile
are
far
too
light
for
style
and
flavor
hits
some
strange
notes
not
the
best
but
definitely
off
the
beaten
path
d
damn
good
beer
this
beer
is
very
sweet
however
the
finish
is
clean
and
it
doesnt
seem
like
a
sugary
mess
as
it
warms
the
booze
becomes
more
prevalent
but
it
is
quite
welcome
very
complex
and
delicious
d
this
could
become
slightly
cloying
but
it
was
a
good
solid
quad
because
of
the
amount
of
sediment
i
have
to
subtract
points
for
appearance
and
mouthfeel
but
overall
this
beer
was
good
and
is
worth
trying
out
notes
strange
beer
and
not
really
what
i
was
expecting
from
a
quad
seemed
a
bit
more
like
a
malty
tripel
overall
i
wasnt
a
big
fan
but
it
wasnt
a
bad
beer
probably
wont
get
it
again
as
there
are
a
number
of
quads
and
tripels
for
that
matter
i
like
better
for
the
same
price
very
good
beer
d
excellent
belgian
quad
no
regret
d
this
is
a
tough
style
to
nail
this
is
drinkable
but
it
certainly
isnt
up
to
trappist
quality
it
is
very
similar
to
belgian
trappist
quads
but
this
one
is
not
very
full
bodied
im
a
bigger
fan
of
the
urthel
tripel
but
this
is
definitely
a
great
beer
huge
rum
flavorsnose
clear
dark
amber
color
medium
sticky
mouthfeel
light
on
the
head
with
a
good
deal
of
lacing
and
very
sweet
raisin
flavors
really
come
through
as
it
warms
and
alcohol
is
always
present
id
normally
like
a
bit
more
complexity
in
my
quads
but
this
is
definitely
enjoyable
this
is
one
heavy
beer
taste
is
very
dark
fruit
with
shades
of
prunes
raisins
dark
cherries
throw
in
a
dose
of
malt
not
much
bitterness
the
finish
is
quite
creamy
and
smooth
i
drank
this
cool
but
not
cold
the
alcohol
was
not
hard
to
put
up
with
and
the
taste
improves
as
the
bottle
is
open
d
this
is
a
very
strong
ale
so
its
definitely
a
sipper
its
not
bad
but
i
am
disappointed
with
the
level
of
bitterness
i
encountered
in
this
one
this
is
the
sixth
quadrupel
ive
reviewed
on
ba
and
i
think
it
slots
in
midway
on
character
and
overall
scores
without
checking
overall
a
solid
quad
but
far
from
spectacular
pours
a
clear
amber
colour
with
thin
white
head
head
dissipates
fairly
quickly
with
very
little
lacing
smells
very
sweet
of
cherries
and
belgian
yeast
taste
is
quite
sweet
as
well
with
small
amount
of
bitterness
some
caramel
too
may
be
one
of
the
sweeter
quads
ive
had
without
the
darker
malts
very
smooth
possibly
because
it
is
a
bit
undercarbonated
jd
mediummodied
low
carbonation
drinkability
is
average
to
slightly
above
will
finish
the
bottle
but
that
will
be
enough
d
im
glad
this
bottle
was
a
leftover
for
volunteers
at
a
recent
brewfest
this
definitely
isnt
worth
the
premium
import
price
ill
take
any
allagash
among
many
others
all
day
over
this
one
the
alcohol
presence
hurts
this
ones
quaffing
rate
significantly
too
notes
overall
this
is
an
outstanding
quad
in
my
opinion
its
complex
its
big
its
pleasantly
boozy
it
drinks
well
and
the
only
thing
i
can
really
pick
on
here
is
the
head
retention
and
lacing
well
done
very
different
than
all
other
belgian
quads
a
very
good
one
to
have
in
the
cellar
this
quad
offers
a
beigeyellow
pour
light
head
leaving
light
lacing
a
nose
of
ale
taste
of
bitter
hops
yeasty
aftertaste
like
a
slice
of
bread
soaked
in
beer
i
am
not
particularly
liking
this
offering
due
to
the
combo
of
bitter
hops
and
yeasty
aftertaste
i
wonder
if
i
have
a
skunky
bottle
i
usually
enjoy
quads
but
not
this
one
drinkability
amazing
for
a
beer
this
big
mouthfeel
is
thick
rich
and
boozy
this
is
quite
drinkable
for
a
belgian
quad
though
i
would
drink
this
at
cellar
temp
straight
out
of
a
cold
kegerator
doesnt
do
this
beer
justice
a
very
flavorful
nightcap
poured
a
darkish
brown
with
decent
carbonation
that
died
quickly
and
left
no
lace
a
good
mix
of
belgian
yeast
along
with
a
semisweet
sugary
malt
smell
along
with
hints
of
citric
fruit
pass
for
the
aroma
medium
bodied
with
an
immense
sweet
malt
body
of
sugar
and
caramel
and
some
bitter
chocolate
has
a
dry
bitterish
toffee
feelhoppy
taste
as
well
and
is
slightly
chewey
as
it
passes
over
the
tongue
the
yeast
strain
along
with
the
abv
lead
to
a
dry
finish
that
makes
this
beer
a
great
sipper
to
enjoy
d
great
full
complex
flavors
throughout
this
beer
good
body
and
great
aroma
add
to
the
enjoyment
the
alcohol
level
is
very
present
but
not
overpowering
not
to
say
this
is
a
sessionable
beer
but
i
dont
think
two
glasses
in
one
night
would
kill
you
extremely
drinkable
could
easily
drink
this
all
night
long
it
could
very
well
be
the
other
brews
from
de
leyerth
that
are
lighter
in
alcohol
are
more
to
my
liking
dthis
has
got
some
solid
flavors
going
on
but
it
is
pretty
hot
it
could
use
some
time
to
mellow
the
urthel
feels
thick
and
silky
in
the
mouth
very
smooth
dangerously
drinkable
i
love
the
story
behind
this
beer
added
to
its
being
delicious
and
what
we
have
here
is
a
perfect
party
beverage
however
one
could
equally
consider
it
a
companion
for
contemplation
i
even
like
the
little
bald
guys
overall
an
excellent
quad
and
one
of
the
best
ive
had
recommended
the
beer
pours
a
dark
reddish
color
with
a
thick
frothy
offwhite
head
that
slowly
fades
to
lacing
the
aroma
is
great
it
has
a
sweet
malty
scent
along
with
a
warm
fruity
yeast
aroma
there
is
a
nice
dark
fruit
character
the
taste
is
good
its
incredibly
smooth
with
lots
of
yeast
character
the
malt
profile
boasts
primarily
of
pale
and
light
crystal
malts
there
is
definitely
a
dry
feel
and
a
nice
bit
of
warmth
the
mouthfeel
is
fine
it
is
a
full
bodied
beer
with
good
carbonation
this
is
a
damn
tasty
beer
its
simple
in
nature
but
well
done
drinkability
is
pretty
good
smooth
not
too
sweet
good
flavor
and
warming
alcohol
a
nice
winter
nightcap
in
the
final
analysis
this
is
a
very
nice
flavorful
balanced
and
pretty
complex
beer
it
is
undoubtedly
potent
as
well
yet
easy
to
sip
and
enjoy
the
urthel
troll
dudes
have
come
up
with
a
winner
here
this
poured
a
cloudy
light
mahogany
with
fluffy
light
tan
head
it
smelled
like
rich
dark
chocolate
and
creamy
yeast
and
banana
nut
bread
with
some
earthy
caramel
it
tasted
like
banana
nut
bread
with
some
creamy
yeast
and
powdery
milk
chocolate
and
earthy
nutty
malt
it
was
fairly
thick
with
smooth
carbonation
and
had
a
bittersweet
aftertaste
with
some
alcohol
warming
overall
this
was
a
very
refined
beer
with
a
very
delicate
taste
and
body
but
nothing
super
rich
or
powerful
the
alcohol
was
apparent
so
this
beer
is
definitely
better
to
sip
definitely
an
enjoyable
beer
fresh
but
it
will
likely
mellow
out
and
the
malt
might
further
sweeten
with
a
few
years
of
age
this
didnt
have
the
obvious
or
powerful
characteristics
that
some
quads
do
but
the
subtleties
had
me
thinking
about
it
the
next
day
and
wanting
more
this
is
a
nice
quad
yet
a
step
below
the
best
certainly
worth
a
try
for
anyone
who
likes
this
style
yet
it
still
has
room
for
improvement
a
quadruple
just
a
little
above
the
average
maybe
it
gets
better
after
some
cellaring
smooth
tasty
and
easytodrink
not
my
favorite
quad
but
a
damn
good
one
anyway
ruby
red
and
maroon
color
relatively
clear
with
lots
of
suspended
particles
lots
of
effervescence
but
rapidly
disappearing
white
head
aroma
of
leather
and
orange
peel
taste
is
very
large
caramel
with
lots
of
malty
sweetness
but
well
balanced
with
hops
long
syrupy
caramel
finish
very
nice
indeed
drinkability
well
this
is
a
weird
quad
i
really
like
it
but
its
not
st
bernardus
or
rochefort
this
750
was
11
so
it
aint
cheap
either
would
i
have
another
on
another
day
sure
if
price
was
no
issue
would
i
choose
this
over
a
superior
similarly
priced
one
no
mfd
its
all
good
enough
cabonation
but
not
particularly
drinkable
from
the
booze
d
to
drink
a
quad
is
to
drink
something
very
complex
if
youre
into
the
adjunct
lagers
you
probably
shouldnt
bother
but
for
rest
of
us
try
this
one
and
the
try
an
adjunct
lager
its
just
like
water
anyway
this
beer
style
is
one
of
my
favourites
and
i
havnt
had
a
bad
one
yet
ruby
colour
small
white
head
aroma
is
not
good
at
all
smells
like
chemical
solvents
and
that
ruins
it
apart
from
that
i
find
burnt
sugar
and
dark
fruit
in
the
aroma
maybe
with
a
hint
of
honey
flavour
is
better
than
the
aroma
lets
on
but
it
is
overwhelmingly
sweet
to
an
extent
that
it
takes
over
all
the
other
flavours
with
that
said
i
do
find
some
nice
notes
of
dark
fruit
honey
and
port
that
makes
this
beer
interesting
enough
to
get
a
rather
good
mark
for
flavour
palate
is
ordinary
for
the
style
full
bodied
with
a
smooth
and
warming
mouthfeel
a
good
sipper
for
a
while
but
the
more
this
sits
out
the
more
noticeable
the
12
abv
becomes
the
alcohol
isnt
masked
quite
as
well
as
some
other
versions
of
this
style
its
not
quite
as
complex
as
some
of
the
trappist
quads
but
overall
this
one
shows
a
lot
of
promise
i
think
i
might
hang
on
to
a
few
bottles
to
see
how
much
it
can
improve
with
age
d
i
know
its
a
quad
but
it
goes
in
the
direction
of
a
barley
wine
imo
its
a
little
too
sweet
for
me
but
i
will
put
some
bottles
in
my
cellar
this
should
become
much
better
after
aging
md
the
consistently
lightly
effervescent
palate
helps
greatly
to
lift
the
overall
heavy
body
a
bit
and
also
renders
a
soothing
even
semirefreshing
mouthfeel
my
criticism
of
this
ale
is
the
heavy
presence
of
the
sugary
elements
on
the
balance
which
come
at
the
expense
of
a
clearer
manifestation
of
fruit
esters
and
spiciness
having
said
that
undeniably
this
ale
is
very
well
crafted
indeed
not
least
demonstrated
by
how
attenuated
the
alc
feels
on
the
palate
and
down
the
throat
d
great
this
beer
is
a
beast
and
an
excellent
sipper
and
cap
to
the
night
it
tastes
and
feels
like
i
am
already
in
dream
land
drinkability
of
this
beer
drinkability
is
huge
will
be
interesting
to
see
in
coming
years
how
this
great
beer
hold
up
poured
from
a
750ml
bottle
into
a
trio
of
snifters
shared
with
psycohops
and
brothercannon
the
quad
appears
a
deep
crimsonchestnut
color
with
a
good
two
inches
of
tight
tan
foam
nose
and
flavor
consist
of
sweet
candi
sugar
dark
fruits
such
as
cherries
dates
raisins
plums
prunes
some
spicy
yeast
fruity
caramelized
malts
bread
just
shy
of
full
bodied
and
amply
carbonated
alcohol
is
quite
noticeable
detracting
a
bit
from
the
drinkability
overall
though
a
pretty
decent
quad
with
age
i
expect
this
beer
would
improve
and
aside
from
the
blatantly
obvious
alcohol
it
does
perform
well
dont
drink
it
young
is
it
a
quadrupel
or
is
it
a
barleywine
who
cares
it
is
big
bold
and
wondrful
it
is
one
of
the
best
beers
i
have
ever
had
the
pleasure
of
tasting
definitely
world
class
if
you
like
big
bold
dark
beers
dont
miss
this
one
jordan
color
was
a
mahogany
with
small
and
thin
off
whitebeige
head
aroma
was
like
grain
alcohol
soaked
raisins
no
real
notes
of
yeast
or
any
spiciness
whatsoever
it
drinks
like
a
brandy
warming
d
drink
it
while
it
is
cold
its
a
good
beer
cold
but
as
it
warms
you
can
really
note
phenolic
flavors
and
slight
astringency
sipping
beer
would
drink
again
in
moderate
amounts
but
cant
drink
a
lot
of
it
d
this
was
a
nice
quad
and
is
for
sure
a
sipping
beer
sweet
but
boozy
it
really
gives
off
that
warming
effect
light
to
mediumbodied
moderate
carbonation
compliments
it
well
no
way
this
can
be
a
session
beer
with
the
high
abv
but
itd
be
nice
to
compliment
an
evening
conversation
by
having
this
one
to
sip
big
flavor
nice
and
boozy
without
falling
prey
to
extreme
heat
or
harshness
sip
this
baby
slow
and
it
will
undress
on
your
tongue
to
reveal
sweet
amber
malts
coated
in
molasses
sticky
caramelized
raisin
rum
and
a
finish
of
breathy
ethanol
and
spiced
hop
leaves
creamy
chewy
body
but
not
so
viscous
that
it
impedes
on
its
drinkability
alcohol
begins
to
wear
on
the
palate
slightly
after
half
a
glass
but
i
can
see
this
sexy
beast
of
a
beer
being
a
perfect
candidate
for
a

the
beer

subsequent
sips

sipping

d
this
one
is
a
slow
sipper
that
would
be
perfect
in
the
colder
months
very
enjoyable
but
i
should
have
found
someone
to
split
this
one
with
about
halfway
through
i
was
ready
to
try
something
else
but
too
buzzed
to
attempt
it
this
one
makes
me
want
to
try
the
other
urthel

that
are
sitting
in

here
drinkability
not
up
there
with
the
other
urthel
beers
i
have
tried
just
too
cloying
overall
another
solid
effort
from
urthel
definitely
a
drinkable
quad
and
the
12
abv
doesnt
get
in
the
way
of
enjoying
this
one
urthel
consistently
makes
good
beer
and
this
is
one
that
is
certainly
worth
revisiting

you

buddy
or
your
wife
it
poured
a
copper
amber
color
with
a
cream
colored
bubbly
head
definite
lacing
on
the
glass
the
smell
was
very
malty
what
you
would
expect
from
a
quad
it
is
a
full
bodied
beer
and
over
takes
your
mouth
the
carmel
and
banana
are
typical
and
overpowering
it
is
a
good
belgium
beer
and
a
true
example
of
a
quadruple
high

and
high
sweetness
mouthfeeldrinkability
very
full
and
creamy
the
carbonation
is
very
lively
in
this
one
extremely
drinkable
there
is
a
reason
this
beer
is
one
of
the
top
rated
quads
it
is
unbelievable
the
head
is
foamy
and
a
full
opaque
color
that
takes
minutes
not
seconds
to
dissipate
the
taste
is
crisp
full
and
sweet
truly
this
is
what
i
expect
to
pay
a
little
more
for
when
i
purchase
a
beer
from
belgium
fantastic
beer
you
should
at
least
try
it
once
pours
a
dirty
brown
in

there
is
a
huge
4
inch

head
forming
on
the
pour
and
taking
several
minutes
to
die
down
so
i
could
top

sugar
abounds
in

well
this
is

smooth

you
only
get
a

boy
do
you
feel
it
about
half

heavy
aroma
of
grape
juice
thats
all
i
get
and
not
very
strong
alcoholy
grapey
taste
heavy
but
not
too
bad
an
aftertaste
very
strong
mouthfeel
a
little
fizzy
but
not
soft
as
it
warms
up
more
fruit
flavor
but
also
much
alcohol
flavor
a
little
smoother
overall
i
would
drink
this
again
but
this
is
so
different
than
other
quads
that
i
have
had
it
does
not
seem
to
fit
in
the
category
if
you
like
troegs
mad
elf
give
it
a
try
d
a
little
unique
for
the
style
it
most
definitely
lacks
a
certain
magic
that
some
other
quads
have
but
it
is
still
tasty
i
have
had
the
honor
of
drinking
two
of
the
urthel
beers
and
cant
wait
to
find
the
others
i
am
a
huge
fan
of
the
balddude
out
of
a
750ml
corked
and
caged
bottle
sits
pretty
in
the
palm
tear
drop
glass
beautiful
ruby
amber
color
clear
with
a
very
tight
white
head
that
settles
into
a
puffy
cap
the
aroma
is
sweet
with
raisins
and
candied
cherries
some
peppery
spice
and
some
fusel
alcohol
the
taste
is
big
on
honey
and
raisins
candi
sugar
very
light
tobacco
a
very
very
sweet
brew
hard
to
separate
from
a
bsda
moderate
body
with
prickly
carbonation
again
very
sweet
but
not
quite
syrupy
or
cloying
nice
big
flavors
but
not
quite
what
i
expected
from
a
quad
expected
more
of
a
malt
body
and
balance
to
the
sweet
still
a
well
made
brew
but
for
a
quad
i
can
find
better
examples
d
this
is
a
really
nice
quad
another
good
one
from
urthel

thin
lasting
head
that
leaves
almost
no
lacing
aroma
is
loads
of
dried
fruits
and
caramel
with
hints
of
molasses
and
alcohol
the
taste
is
a
nice
complex
blend
of
fruits
caramel
and
some
subtle
spice
the
beer
is
certainly
on
the
heavy
side
but
there
is
a
smooth
dryness
that
eases
things
up
this
is
a
very
enjoyable
quad
one
of
the
best
beers
from
urthel
ive
had
pours
a
hazy
amber
color
with
some
suspended
yeast

of
an
offwhite
color
good

and
good

of

sugary
sweetness
slight

aroma
and
a
hint
of

the
style
of
a
quadrupel
mouth
feel
is
smooth
and
slightly
thick
with
a
high
carbonation
level
tastes
of
tart
malt
up
front
with
some
slight
alcohol
then
a
strong
sweetness
overtakes
there
are
slight
fruit
flavors
throughout
overall
the
sweetness
smooths
the
alcohol
flavors
nicely
and
the
finish
is
amazing
its
hard
to
believe
this
is
nearly
12
abv
taste
is
pretty
standard
for
the
style
not
exactly
unique
but
in
no
way
flawed
surprisingly
bitter
finish
considering
the
big
malty
smell
a
terrific
balance
fullbodied
and
extremely
drinkable
ive
had
worse
quadrupels
i
would
definitely
recommend
this
and
probably
get
it
again
if
i
see
it
d
outside
of
the
bit
of
heaviness
i
feel
from
this
beer
it
is
quite
good
it
can
be
a
challenging
brew
but
given
plenty
of
time
it
should
make
for
an
enjoyable
evening
this
is
a
great
beer
but
it
would
be
more
drinkable
if
it
werent
so
sweet
definitely
a
special
ale
for
that
special
winter
occasiondrink
a
bottle
when
the
blizzard
starts
and
by
the
time
you
wake
up
the
blizzard
should
be
over
second
urthel
beer
and
it
beats
the
pants
off
of
hop
it
if
you
ask
me
pours

is
of

and
dark

some
alcohol
as
well
almost
vodka
like

a
good
quad
should
be
nice
mix
of
yeast
bread
dark
sweet

and
an
alcohol
kiss
warming
as

mouthfeel
was
thick
and
silky
overall
an
easy
drinker
given
the
massive
abv
it
was
too
strong
in
the
nose
but
well
hidden
in
the
taste
now
i
regret
waiting
this
is
an
amazing
beer
with
a
very
rich
complex
taste
and
aroma
that
for
me
puts
to
shame
most
of
the
beers
i
passed
this
up
for
in
the
past
thick
somewhat
heavy
and
sweet
tastes
of
dark
berries
and
dates
plus
quite
a
bit
more
but
unfortunately
i
didnt
take
notes
while
drinking
so
im
working
off
memory
there
are
other
reviews
here
with
excellent
details
of
the
aroma
taste
though
if
you
enjoy
wines
the
complexity
richness
of
the
tastes
reminded
me
of
the
first
time
i
had
jarvis
cabernet
sauvignon
but
at
about
110th
the
price
high
alcohol
content
my
bottle
says
11
not
the
12
listed
here
thats
very
well
balanced
with
the
multitude
of
other
flavors
mouthfeeldrinkability
as
with
most
of
the
quads
we
sampled
this
mouthfeel
was
absolutely
sublime
a
soft
seafoamy
texture
that
brings
the
best
out
of
the
beers
flavors
this
won
best
in
show
for
me
and
i
cant
wait
to
enjoy
another
one
soon
with
a
wedge
of
good
trappist
cheese
i
enjoyed
slowly
making
my
way
through
the
bottle
this
beer
is
everywhere
at
once
but
always
giving
a
confectionate
sweetness
and
winelike
fruitiness
that
makes
it
difficult
to
drink
its
sweetness
along
with
the
disjointed
nature
of
flavors
and
the
inbalance
keeps
this
beer
from
competing
with
the
st
bernardus
and
chimays
of
the
world
definately
prefered
to
the
la
trappe
and
most
american
attempts
of
the
dark
strong
belgian
styles
yum
mom
and
i
found
this
12
oz
to
be
tasty
tease
other
than
the
strength
no
impediment
to
drinking
more
than
one
even
though
i
mentioned
booze
in
the
nose
mom
had
no
idea
it
was
high
abv
until
it
was
gone
and
i
told
her
overall
impression
a
big
fruity
belgian
strong
dark
ale
this
one
is
a
sipper
and
dangerously
drinkable
nicely
done
11
2
oz
bottle
poured
into
my
westvleteren
goblet
pours
a
sort
of
ashen
goldenrod
color
sort
of
sickly
to
be
honest
certainly
far
lighter
than
any
standard
quadrupel
creamy
tan
head
displays
great
retention
and
leaves
films
of
sticky
lacing
aroma
is
diacetyl
and
caramel
and
thats
it
flavor
is
very
similar
old
butterscotch
and
caramel
make
this
a
very
sweet
beer
there
is
also
a
whisper
of
dark
fruitiness
and
alcohol
mouthfeel
is
fullbodied
and
sticky
from
the
sweetness
pretty
onedimensional
and
possibly
suffering
from
a
brewing
flaw
with
all
that
diacetyl
not
really
mindful
of
the
style
either
urthel
samaranth
is
definitely
a
quadrupel
ale
the
color
is
a
dark
amber
and
is
opaque
it
has
a
scent
that
i
cant
place
not
bad
just
different
the
flavor
is
very
similar
there
is
a
destinct
malty
flavor
and
you
can
taste
the
alcohol
but
there
is
something
else
that
i
cant
quite
put
my
finger
on
there
is
a
fair
amount
of
carbonation
the
combination
of
the
malt
and
carbonation
give
the
beer
a
good
feel
overall
it
is
a
decent
beer
it
is
very
strong
in
both
alcohol
11
and
malt
flavoring
not
something
that
you
are
going
to
drink
several
of
just
a
nice
beer
to
sip
and
enjoy
cheer
this
beer
even
with
the
high
abv
is
highly
drinkable
that
is
one
of
the
hgh
points
taste
vs
drinkablility
v
price
is
amazing
have
one
give
it
a
try
not
bad
but
like
i
said
at
least
twice
already
this
is
way
too
unbalanced
a
pretty
easy
drinking
quad
worth
trying
d
given
the
heft
this
was
surprisingly
drinkable
would
love
to
try
this
on
draft
drinkability
as
far
as
quads
go
this
one
is
just
a
bit
too
sweet
and
syrupy
for
my
taste
but
i
would
still
buy
it
again
seems
complex
enough
where
if
paired
correctly
it
would
be
delicious
mouthfell
was
medium
body
with
hint
of
spiceness
and
alcohol
which
it
hides
very
well
for
the
percentage
d
it
was
a
rich
flavorful
and
complex
beer
that
left
me
wanting
more
im
prone
to
keeping
this
one
in
my
stash
for
special
occasions
i
could
drink
a
couple
of
these
poured
into
a
tulip
glass
it
was
a
hazy
dark
red
with
a
good
white
head
that
was
retained
over
the
entire
length
of
the
drink
could
see
some
slight
streaming
of
carbonation
to
the
top
of
the
glass
the
aroma
was
sweet
and
fruity
the
taste
had
some
fruit
flavors
i
could
swear
that
it
was
cherry
mixed
in
with
malt
a
every
so
slight
mention
of
the
alcohol
a
little
too
sweet
for
my
taste
carbonation
was
good
and
the
beer
was
easy
to
drink
but
you
probably
dont
want
to
drink
too
many
at
one
time
overall
a
very
good
beer
a
750ml
bottle
served
in
a
tulip
glass
this
beer
was
a
ruby
red
color
with
a
mediumsized
white
head
that
left
a
little
bit
of
lacing
it
had
a
sweet
fruity
aroma
i
would
describe
the
aroma
as
that
of
cranberry
orange
bread
the
taste
was
fruity
with
a
strong
malt
presence
hops
kicked
in
late
maybe
a
little
bit
on
the
sweet
side
but
a
truly
enjoyable
beer
tasty
and
strong
but
it
could
definately
dry
up
a
bit
too
sweet
poured
into
a
snifter
and
got
a
huge
bubbly
almost
white
heat
about
three
fingers
thick
that
would
not
go
away
it
has
some
very
dense
lacing
and
it
covered
a
nice
deep
amber
body
that
was
full
of
carbonation
it
has
a
very
faint
fruity
aroma
with
a
faint
alcohol
and
some
sweet
scents
as
well
but
thats
all
i
got
room
it
it
has
semismooth
feel
with
a
thick
body
and
some
a
strong
carbonation
feeling
on
your
tongue
it
has
a
good
earthy
taste
mixed
in
with
some
dark
fruits
a
few
spices
and
a
dry
aftertaste
and
it
warms
up
your
mouth
as
it
goes
down
but
you
can
barely
taste
the
alcohol
init
thanks
jason

other
than
the
insanely
delicious
hopit
and
possibly
tonicum
finiboldhus
i
havent
been
impressed
with
de
leyerth
brouwerijen
beer
samaranth
is
decent
but
its
no
quadrupel
sorry
cant
recommend
this
one
good
fruity
belgian
dutch
strong
ale
that
just
lacks
the
complexity
to
make
it
a
really
great
beer
this
one
seems
very
filtered
so
i
doubt
aging
would
make
alot
of
difference
but
it
may
be
worth
trying
decent
drinkability
for
such
a
big
beer
but
the
aggressive
alcohol
aroma
detracts
and
makes
me
think
i
could
ignite
a
shot
of
this
stuff
every
time
the
glass
gets
close
to
my
nose
750ml
caged
and
corked
bottle
from
the
lighthouse
in
manchester
pours
a
hazy
brownred
body
with
a
thin
light
tan
head
smells
fruity
grapes
plums
and
apples
most
noticeable
with
a
generous
dose
of
brown
sugar
and
caramel
tastes
very
fruity
as
well
with
apple
and
plum
like
qualities
along
with
a
generous
dose
of
caramel
and
toffee
just
a
hint
of
alcohol
toward
the
finish
with
a
fair
bit
of
alcohol
warming
apparent
heavy
bordering
on
viscous
body
with
light
carbonation
a
sipper
for
certain
but
the
pleasing
combination
of
flavors
helps
the
drinkability
some
allinall
a
solid
tasty
quad
no
more
no
less
sampled
on
41208
d
very
good
drinkability
considering
the
abv
with
a
nice
complexity
leaves
you
wanting
more
a
good
sipping
beer
just
dont
drink
too
many
too
early
if
you
are
planning
a
long
night
out
quircky
little
gnomelooking
dude
on
the
bottle
looks
like
hes
enjoying
this
one
have
a
feeling
i
will
too
pours
a
hazy
copper
with
a
fleeting
and
thin
offwhite
head
into
a
goblet
biscuity
aromas
up
front
with
some
phenols
fresh
baked
cinnamon
bread
and
apples
as
an
afterthought
this
creates
an
interesting
smell
that
i
have
not
quite
experienced
before
big
and
edgy
malts
fill
the
palate
the
alcohol
heat
is
present
i
like
to
know
its
there
so
thats
cool
with
me
apples
white
grapes
and
pears
mix
in
well
with
some
sour
candy
while
a
very
inconspicuous
hoppiness
lurks
in
the
background
carbonation
is
quick
huge
and
excellent
mouthfeel
is
medium
to
full
bodied
drinkability
is
as
expected
in
a
beer
of
this
magnitude
that
is
it
makes
you
respect
its
complexity
all
that
being
said
there
is
something
about
this
beer
that
doesnt
totally
suit
what
im
looking
for
in
a
quadrupel
its
something
i
cant
quite
put
a
finger
on
but
that
in
no
way
makes
it
lesser
of
a
beer
and
is
probably
due
more
to
personal
preference
than
anything
else
deceptively
easy
to
drink
once
you
start
sippin
the
alcohol
seems
to
settle
way
into
the
background
drinkability
very
nice
for
a
beer
with
high
alcohol
md
mouthfeel
is
moderate
really
but
the
alcohol
really
brings
on
a
heavier
feel
carbonation
is
relatively
light
but
persistent
the
strength
of
the
brew
is
distracting
to
me
but
the
more
you
drink
the
more
tolerable
it
becomes
overall
pretty
good
but
its
something
i
really
need
to
be
in
the
mood
for
taste
strongly
complemented
the
aroma
certainly
not
the
best
quad
ive
sampled
and
a
far
cry
from
many
of
the
more
wellknown
belgian
versions
out
there
nonetheless
this
was
a
decent
brew
gathering
some
flavor
with
a
decent
mouthfeel
although
drinkability
took
a
hit
due
to
the
high
abv
and
lack
of
exciting
and
intricate
flavors
can
you
say
underrated
maybe
i
somehow
got
a
bottle
that
was
blessed
by
the
beer
gods
but
i
thought
this
brew
was
absolutely
wicked
ill
be
revisiting
this
again
soon
overall
this
is
a
big
tasty
beer
but
the
alcohol
catches
up
with
it
theres
a
fusel
alcohol
feel
and
big
warming
feel
the
appearance
is
a
dark
brown
with
a
thin
tan
head
the
aroma
is
an
almost
creamy
sweetness
of
caramel
malt
and
esters
the
flavor
is
quite
complex
with
chocolate
and
cherries
cola
toffee
caramel
and
a
touch
of
dates
the
fruits
are
very
big
but
rather
a
nice
compliment
to
the
sweet
malts
its
a
shame
about
the
booze
wed
have
an
otherwise
awesome
quad
here
full
body
with
a
smooth
velvety
mouthfeel
very
strong
and
the
alcohol
doesnt
hind
at
all
in
this
one
all
in
all
a
nice
strong
quad
worth
your
time
and
money
overall
i
would
say
to
head
on
down
to
the
place
where
you
buy
your
beer
request
that
they
start
carrying
it
walk
in
there
one
day
with
a
ski
mask
on
and
yielding
an
automatic
rifle
demand
the
money
out
of
the
cash
register
and
with
that
money
turn
around
and
buy
the
samaranth
you
just
cant
steal
beer
can
you
overall
a
nice
and
warming
pint
but
the
finish
had
me
drinking
a
glass
of
water
and
ordering
something
else
new
a
fitting
beer
for
the
last
while
in
amsterdam
it
is
pretty
drinkable
for
a
quad
do
not
get
me
wrong
as
compared
to
a
more
traditional
quad
or
even
a
nontraditional
one
like
the
ommegang
three
philosophers
that
i
had
on
sunday
so
its
the
most
freshinmymindquadexperience
it
is
a
lot
smoother
a
lot
crisper
a
lot
easier
to
drink
the
alcohol
is
there
so
if
youre
drinking
a
750
by
yourself
youll
be
feeling
it
a
little
before
you
finish
it
but
it
is
a
lot
easier
to
drink
then
a
lot
of
quads
that
there
are
however
what
is
interesting
about
this
beer
is
that
i
cant
foresee
a
lot
if
any
people
falling
in
love
with
this
beer
its
a
little
tart
for
quad
lovers
a
little
too
drysour
for
flemish
sour
lovers
i
can
imagine
people
who
love
geuzes
might
find
this
acceptable
but
thats
a
really
low
in
alcohol
style
so
the
alcohol
might
get
to
them
its
a
tough
beer
there
are
so
many
things
to
like
about
it
but
there
isnt
anything
to
love
about
it
dammit
pairing
suggestions
good
with
mild
goat
cheeses
im
imagining
it
a
solid
winner
with
grilled
scallops
creme
brulee
salmon
pork
terrinechops
esp
with
cherry
sauce
duck
with
cherries
sweetish
mushroom
napoleon
or

thanks
to
brouche
for
sending
me
this
brew
in

ultra
served
slightly
chilled
in
my
westvleteren
glass
from
an
11
2
ounce
brown
bottle
poured
a
deep
almost
brown
amber
color
a
solid
inch
of
thick
bubbly
offwhite
head
rose
up
from
the
glass
awesome
head
retention
on
this
beer
thanks
to
the
very
active
carbonation
bubbles
streaming
up
from
the
bottom
of
the
glass
tons
of
thick
clingy
lace
was
left
behind
on
the
glass
smell
was
of
plums
dark
cherries
a
touch
of
wood
belgian
yeast
candi
sugar
and
a
touch
of
alcohol
very
fruity
flavor
was
again
plum
semisour
dark
cherries
some
sweet
malts
sweet
candi
sugar
and
some
faint
yeasty
notes
finishes
rather
smooth
with
some
alcohol
heat
felt
in
the
back
of
the
throat
tons
of
carbonation
felt
as
well
a
nice
full
bodied
mouthfeel
that
was
somewhat
thick
and
palate
coating
pretty
good
drinkability
just
becareful
the
big
abv
will
sneak
up
on
you
a
solid
urthel
offering
somehow
this
is
a
bit
dull
tasting
certainly
not
bad
and
nothing
seems
particularly
off
but
i
is
just
not
quite
as
well
balanced
and
flavorful
as
i
expected
clearly
by
my
rating
i
feel
that
this
beer
is
severely
underrated
i
think
this
brouwerij
would
do
a
lot
better
if
they
got
rid
of
their
goofy
ass
labels
pours
a
dark
yet
fairly
clear
and
very
yeasty
brown
nose
is
of
dried
fruit
the
taste
follows
with
typical
dry
dark
fruit
taste
with
a
little
bit
of
spices
very
sweet
on
the
lips
and
very
smooth
for
its
11
a
wonderful
example
of
a
belgian
quad
dont
be
fooled
by
the
pathetic
attempts
of
american
breweries
at
a
belgian
style
quadruple
so
far
only
belgium
has
perfected
this
style
not
to
say
those
beers
arent
good
cause
they
are
the
reverend
by
avery
but
they
are
a
long
shot
from
a
real
quad
great
beer
worth
the
price
be
careful
pouring
unless
you
like
a
little
extra
nutty
flavor
ive
had
this
brew
probably
68
times
over
the
year
and
have
always
been
happy
with
my
purchase
tasty
and
a
good
value
for
a
belgian
quad
i
need
to
pick
up
some
more
for
the
cellar
and
promise
myself
to
not
actually
drink
them
when
i
am
feeling
a
jones
for
belgian
beers
flavorwise
this
is
more
subdued
than
urthels
tripel
which
is
odd
but
it
still
has
a
great
taste
i
should
note
that
my
bottle
is
different
and
the
abv
is
marked
as
11
since
the
tripel
i
bought
was
also
different
i
think
the
picturesabv
info
need
to
be
updated
for
this
brand
the
scent
is
characteristically
belgian
with
some
trappist
cheese
figuring
into
the
odor
tastes
of
candi
sugar
blackberry
and
mild
spice
the
alcohol
is
wellmasked
i
thought
the
tripel
tasted
a
bit
better
but
this
is
also
excellent
very
good
beer
perhaps
not
exceptional
but
quite
enjoyable
nonetheless
a
sipper
no
doubt
but
a
very
interesting
one
to
enjoy
easy
to
drink
for
such
a
warmingly
alcoholic
brew
i
can
only
have
one
at
a
time
but
i
am
glad
i
have
a
few
more
in
the
cellar
md
carbonation
is
just
right
smooth
drinkability
is
ok
considering
the
abv
medium
bodied
and
incredible
smoothness
the
glass
started
out
pretty
good
at
first
but
the
alcohol
finish
got
to
me
after
a
while
this
has
a
good
deal
of
promise
and
allure
and
im
rating
it
decently
because
i
feel
the
good
outweighs
the
bad
ultimately
it
probably
needs
many
years
to
settle
down
and
even
then
i
have
a
feeling
the
sparse
body
will
have
a
hard
time
dealing
with
its
firewater
tendencies
this
is
definitely
a
beer
to
keep
around
during
the
winter
months
try
this
one
with
glazed
ham
sounds
unusual
but
it
works
pours
a
medium
brown
orange
with
a
good
crean
colored
head
no
real
hop
aroma
to
speak
of
but
i
do
detect
sweetess
in
the
aroma
taste
reminds
me
of
burnt
candy
sugarcarmel
i
dont
expect
hopsand
dont
get
them
mouthfeel
is
edium
and
drinkability
is
high
i
am
no
a
huge
fan
of
belgium
beersbut
this
is
one
of
my
favs
mouthfeel
is
full
and
luscious
while
maintaining
a
reasonable
amount
of
drinkability
it
accomplishes
this
with
a
dry
finish
highly
recommended
d
not
my
favorite
quad
and
not
my
favorite
urthel
product
a
bit
rough
on
the
palate
with
a
strong
alcoholic
taste
perhaps
some
more
aging
could
do
this
one
well
sort
of
a
light
take
on
the
quad
and
although
its
interesting
its
a
bit
of
a
letdown
id
consider
buying
it
again
but
for
this
style
i
find
it
more
exciting
to
explore
than
to
settle
on
one
brew
something
that
could
be
thoroughly
enjoyed
around
the
holidays
d
cant
put
my
finger
on
it
i
mean
at
first
it
seems
like
a
decent
beer
but
something
about
this
one
kicks
ass
i
loved
it
good
drinkability
for
this
abv
this
new
style

this

draught

this

has

to
dissapoint
me
drinkability
i
do

in
this
brew
i
would
have
guessed
it
for
a
very
flavorful
dubbel
of
around
8
exceptionaly
easy
drinker
for
a
quad
and
very
tasty
as
well
i
am
not
a
beer
fan
in
general
but
i
love
belgian
ales
in
fact
i
have
yet
to
have
one
that
i
dont
like
i
recently
had
the
urthel
samaranth
at
richos
pub
house
aka
new
albanian
brewing
company
during
their
gravity
head
shindig
i
have
to
say
it
is
easily
in
my
top
3
of
this
style
chimay
grand
reserve
and
delirium
tremens
being
the
other
2
i
was
served
in
the
appropriate
urthel
glassware
and
it
was
very
pretty
too
look
at
and
it
smelled
wonderful
it
was
very
sweet
and
very
strong
im
not
an
expert
at
picking
out
flavors
and
such
like
some
people
on
here
but
i
know
that
i
am
definitely
going
to
be
looking
for
it
anywhere
and
everywhere
that
sells
beer
i
got
this
bottle
for
just
over
4
a
steal
imho
if
it
wasnt
mispriced
im
going
back
for
the
lot
of
them
you
can
tell
from
the
first
appearance
that
this
is
not
your
ordinary
quad
urthel
continues
to
impress
with
solid
brews
that
push
the
boundaries
of
existing
styles
another
outstanding
belgian
from
what
is
fast
becoming
my
favorite
belgian
brewery
dark
honeygold
and
cloudy
flavor
is
rich
and
smooth
with
fruity
hints
and
just
a
whisper
of
bitterness
the
texture
is
smooth
but
it
has
a
nice
bite
that
reminds
you
this
is
a
strong
ale
one
of
the
best
beers
i
have
ever
tried
worth
seeking
out
im
sure
this
one
is
great
fresh
but
two
years
really
added
some
smoothness
im
buying
some
more
of
this
first
chance
i
get
this
was
poured
into
an
urthel
chalice
and
produced
a
dark
reddish
brown
with
a
tan
dense
head
good
lacing
it
is
very
rich
in
apple
and
sugar
smells
with
other
fruit
as
well
very
hearty
and
strong
the
apple
qualities
prevail
in
the
taste
with
a
nice
sweetness
and
strong
alcohol
start
and
a
good
hoppy
finish
very
smooth
and
very
drinkable
despite
the
abv
there
are
better
quads
out
there
but
this
is
still
a
great
one
recommended
i
had
the
pleasure
of
being
introduced
to
the
brewer
of
urthel
and
her
beer
at
toronado
in
san
francisco
a
month
ago
ever
since
then
ive
been
trying
to
get
my
hands
on
no
not
her
although
hildegard
is
a
sight
for
sore
eyes
her
hop
it
creation
but
i
have
yet
to
find
a
store
in
my
area
that
carries
it
in
the
1
plus
pint
bottle
while
my
search
continues
for
that
precious
gem
i
came
across
this
accomplishment
and
what
an
accomplishment
it
is
this
quad
with
the
funny
name
was
popped
from
a
corked
bottle
and
instantly
got
me
pumped
to
experience
its
flavor
lots
of
fruit
particularly
strawberries
and
sweet
fruit
in
general
but
not
in
an
overpowering
way
and
this
is
not
to
suggest
this
headed
into
lambic
country
quite
the
opposite
it
pours
into
my
duvel
tulip
glass
with
a
deep
copper
color
and
a
white
head
that
settles
quite
nicely
lace
draped
the
glass
throughout
the
entire
experience
a
very
abundant
aroma
again
strawberries
and
sweet
fruit
gushed
from
my
deep
glass
and
lots
of
candied
sugar
in
the
aroma
too
which
introduced
itself
in
the
initial
taste
again
not
overpowering
but
the
sweetness
balances
so
perfectly
with
the
slightly
boozy
finish
and
the
silky
smooth
mouthfeel
i
think
balanced
best
describes
this
quad
its
sweet
pleasant
flavor
makes
this
a
highly
drinkable
treat
in
fact
one
of
the
best
ive
ever
had
although
there
is
some
alcohol
in
the
finish
and
at
11
5
abv
its
a
whopper
of
a
brew
which
will
give
you
a
nice
buzz
the
alcohol
is
quite
subtle
drink
it
with
a
roaring
fire
in
the
hearth
and
a
block
of
room
temperature
cabots
seriously
sharp
cheddar
cheese
it
simply
doesnt
get
much
better
than
that
from
a
750ml
corked
caged
bottle
as
god
or
at
least
his
workers
intended
pours
an
energetic
cloudy
brownishorange
with
a
medium
density
rocky
head
much
lighter
than
i
expected
for
a
quadrupel
which
is
i
assume
the
style
based
on
the
description
quadrium
ale
ok
so
also
i
cheated
by
reading
the
style
listed
here
but
lets
not
nitpick
smells
of
caramel
bubblegum
sour
oranges
and
a
hint
of
something
oaky
also
not
what
i
expected
of
the
style
but
nothing
i
dont
like
yet
taste
i
think
im
doing
the
dog
getting
scratched
in
the
right
place
leg
twitch
oranges
cocoa
lemons
a
dry
finish
that
just
brings
the
malty
start
to
a
perfect
balance
the
mouthfeel
is
silky
and
oily
not
really
chewy
at
all
again
surprises
me
for
its
style
drinkability
probably
goes
without
saying
given
the
review
so
far
no
real
alcohol
burn
a
bit
of
warmth
so
no
problems
there
the
balanced
flavor
will
make
this
whole
bottle
go
down
rather
easily
in
short
find
this
one
and
fast
a
nice
quad
seems
like
a
nice
beer
to
be
drinking
on
this
super
sunday
as
the
colts
repeatedly
punt
and
turn
the
ball
over
d
very
drinkable
and
quite
enjoyable
extremely
coating
on
the
palate
high
abv
isnt
noticeable
an
interesting
beer
pours
a
wheaten
straw
color
i
kind
of
expected
something
a
little
darker
this
being
a
quad
the
nose
is
kind
of
absent
slight
fruit
notes
slight
alcohol
not
real
exciting
the
taste
on
the
other
hand
is
much
better
the
malt
is
a
little
subdued
but
the
fruit
is
right
up
front
overall
really
well
balanced
nothing
to
write
home
about
though
this
beer
did
have
incredible
lacing
not
bad
but
at
12
the
lines
of
good
and
ba
i
also
get
a
bit
of
booze
but
not
enough
to
suspect
the
11
5
this
is
a
very
drinkable
beer
but
a
little
mild
for
a
quad
i
was
a
little
disappointed
eric
overall
it
will
be
a
good
experience
if
youre
not
turned
off
by
a
fruit
influence
on
a
strong
belgian
quad
the
malt
is
not
completely
lost
on
this
one
but
it
is
far
from
a
focus
certainly
worth
a
go
i
look
forward
to
trying
more
of
their
product
as
their
whole
line
is
available
here
excellent
beer
the
pour
into
my
chimay
chalice
raises
a
lasting
two
finger
head
that
falls
slowly
its
very
creamy
and
colored
very
light
tan
the
beer
is
barely
translucent
and
has
very
visible
carbonation
streaming
from
the
center
of
the
glass
the
body
has
a
murky
brown
color
but
with
an
odd
internal
glow
perhaps
due
to
odd
light
diffusion
the
lacing
is
certainly
resilient
there
are
some
ruby
highlights
as
well
the
nose
is
yeasty
darkly
fruity
raisiny
caramel
and
has
hints
of
coffee
the
taste
is
very
sweet
throughout
with
many
of
the
above
characteristics
joining
in
plus
a
lovely
cinnamon
flavor
the
alcohol
is
hidden
very
well
and
only
shows
itself
when
the
sips
are
too
closely
spaced
perhaps
it
adds
a
bit
of
a
peppery
taste
too
the
mouth
is
definitely
on
the
thick
side
with
very
tingly
carbonation
definitely
the
best
quad
ive
gotten
to
thus
far
i
first
sampled
this
last
year
at
arbor
brewing
companys
belgian
tasting
i
was
so
impresssed
that
i
went
out
the
next
day
and
purchased
some
for
more
intensive
sampling
its
been
a
favorite
ever
since
beware
the
alcohol
in
this
little
fellow
can
sneak
up
on
you
an
excellent
beer
for
wintertime
hibernation
pours
a
slightly
cloudy

color
nice
carbonation
nice
small
creamy

tons
of

afterwards

of

the
taste
is

and
warm

the

another

colored
body
with
a
big

with
decent

the

is

the

big

with
a

great
beer
drinkability
this
is
good
but
not
great
also
obviously
high
abv
supresses
sessionability
this
beer
pours
dark
gold
with
a
foamy
cappuccino
like
head
with
nice
lacing
the
smell
is
sweet
and
yeasty
but
not
too
strong
the
taste
is
very
much
like
the
smell
but
much
more
up
front
plus
there
is
a
lot
of
spiciness
that
compliments
the
beer
nicely
the
mouthfeel
is
cery
creamy
with
a
nice
carbonation
that
feels
like
bottle

its

not

to
take
away
from
th

of
the

only
way
i
can
really
explain
the
taste
is
very
winey
if
that
makes
any
sense
overall
a
vey
good
belgium
considering
i
am
not

was

philosophers
snifter
initial
2finger
thick
head
that
very
slowly
dissolves
into
a
web
of
fragmented
lacing
throughout
the
sides
of
the
glass
the
hue
was
thin
and
golden
and
a
little
more
transparent
than
youd
expect
for
this
style
initial
nose
hints
at
a
a
subtly
candied
banana
flavoring
with
a
a
haze
of
alcohol
the
first
swig
reveals
a
dry
and
slightly
bitter
taste
offering
a
spicy
tickle
on
my
tongue
the
feel
is
initially
vibrant
and
complex
with
a
splash
of
sour
banana
jumping
out
that
complexity
however
fades
pretty
quickly
with
each
sip
after
finishing
i
was
left
with
a
subtle
burn
in
the
back
of
my
throat
overall
a
pleasant
experience
something
id
definitely
order
again
but
with
the
high
alcohol
that
starts
to
kick
in
as
the
glass
empties
id
probably
drink
no
more
than
1
of
these
in
a
single
sitting
extremely
drinkable
has
a
nice
winey
taste
but
very
balanced
dep
and
rich
while
retaining
a
nice
smoothness
drinkability
above
average
nothing
grating
or
cloying
about
this
beer
and
easy
to
drink
well
above
average
piquantly
spicy
with
a
touch
of
black
pepper
coupled
with
a
nicely
sweet

tropical
fruit
flavor
mouthfeel
is
slightly
viscous
and
carries
with
it
a
moderate
alcohol
sensation
though
not
as
strong
as
one
would
imagine
from
an
11
5
abv
beer
a
well
crafted
thoroughly
enjoyable
beer
one
of
the
better
ive
had
in
recent
memory
it
takes
a
lot
of
flavor
to
punch
through
the
heavy
blanket
of
alcohol
but
the
interestingly
complex
components
nonetheless
blend
enjoyably
to
come
of
smartly
the
abv
as
noted
is
mighty
beefy
and
it
is
wisely
heeded
placing
a
very
real
limit
on
things
a
lot
of
beer
a
lot
of
flavor
and
a
lot
of
fun
all
in
one
bottle
what
a
deal
beer
is
good
happy
beering
the
flavor
matches
the
aroma
nicely
as
it
begins
witha
slight
touch
of
a
citrusy
bitterness
that
segues
into
a
sweettoasty
malt
flavor
that
finshes
very
clean
for
an
alcohol
content
of
11
5
this
ale
drinks
incredibly
smooth
and
i
find
that
it
is
easier
to
drink
than
duvel
though
i
find
this
much
more
complex
a
great
beer
but
a
little
thin
for
a
quadrupel
the
draft
pours
a
deep
golden
amber
color
with
moderate
haze
and
small
whitish
head
which
lingers
around
leaving
a
delicate
sugary
lace
very
strong
aroma
appears
to
be
a
gridlocked
battle
between
caramelsugar
fresh
bitter
hops
sweet
fruity
esters
and
alcohol
the
discreetness
of
the
aromas
was
my
first
indication
the
quad
might
be
bit
unbalanced
and
a
few
sips
quickly
confirmed
that
tastes
of
these
aromas
were
indeed
not
well
blended
albeit
a
bit
more
complex
then
the
nose
had
lead
me
to
expect
the
hops
accentuated
by
the
apparent
hardness
of
the
water
ultimately
dominated
the
finish
of
this
beer
which
is
rather
unusual
for
the
style
but
indicative
of
the
brewerys
willingness
to
experiment
there
was
also
a
very
pleasant
tartness
from
the
yeast
in
addition
to
the
sour
apple
grape
and
citrus
esters
although
the
body
was
rather
syrupy
the
generous
use
of
sugar
drys
out
and
balances
the
richness
of
the
sweet
malt
with
notes
of
caramel
honey
toast
rum
and
raisins
there
is
a
lot
to
the
mouthfeel
but
it
would
have
done
better
had
the
overall
taste
profile
been
smoother
this
quad
is
fairly
drinkable
as
its
relatively
digestible
in
spite
of
such
high
gravity
making
for
a
robust
tasting
beer
that
goes
down
easy
and
masks
its
high
abv
very
well
still
the
recipe
could
use
some
tweaking
and
additionally
the
beer
tasted
a
bit
young
bottle
conditioned
im
sure
it
would
smooth
out
nicely
with
age
but
the
fresh
keg
i
tasted
had
clearly
not
fully
matured
the
urthel
is
certainly
worth
trying
for
those
that
tend
to
gravitate
to
the
more
extreme
beers
but
purists
and
lightweights
might
want
to
steer
clear
taste
marked
down
some
due
to
increasing
bitterness
into
the
bottle
despite
being
in
a
very
poorly
lit
incandescent
light
area
this
pours
a
clear
reddish
amber
with
a
huge
head
the
head
has
a
million
tiny
bubblesalot
of
carbonation
in
this
beer
the
smell
is
candy
sugar
and
smoked
wood
the
aroma
is
very
sweet
with
abit
of
a
hop
afterscent
the
taste
is
sweet
with
candysmoked
wood
hops
and
maybe
an
apple
aftertaste
the
mf
is
medium
and
very
well
balanced
this
is
a
very
drinkable
quadrupel
the
alcohol
is
sudued
i
would
highly
recommend
this
taste
was
sweet
and
sticky
with
alcohol
and
very
little
bitterness
there
was
fruit
like
apricots
and
peaches
packed
in
an
overly
sweet
body
there
is
little
i
can
say
about
this
beer
except
that
i
feel
this
beer
was
completely
out
of
balance
very
little
bitterness
to
compensate
for
the
alcohol
and
sweetness
of
the
beer
i
am
probably
one
of
the
few
that
has
this
opinion
and
i
dont
think
this
is
a
bad
beer
but
it
needs
less
body
sweetness
or
more
bitterness
yet
another
in
a
long
line
of
belgian
beers
that
i
would
die
for
despite
the
high
alcohol
it
goes
down
easily
and
the
complex
exotic
flavor
profile
makes
every
sip
a
joy

very

another
winner
from
urthel
love
the
hopit
as
well
great
quad
not
over
the
top
way
too
drinkable
an
unusual
quad
in
that
most
brewers
aim
for
darker
malts
and
more
ripe
fruits
very
tasty
though
and
the
strength
kinda
sneaks
up
on
you
pours
out
a
light
orange
amber
with
a
lightly
tan
head
the
aroma
is
very
fruity
orange
and
apple
it
smells
sweet
the
taste
is
also
quite
fruity
apples
and
grapes
is
pretty
sweet
and
lightly
spiced
just
a
touch
yeast
i
dont
taste
any
of
the
alcohol
the
aftertaste
seems
to
be
fruity
and
more
on
the
tart
side
than
sweet
its
got
lots
of
carbonation
i
didnt
expect
this
one
to
look
or
taste
anything
like
it
does
when
i
bought
it
but
still
good
to
enjoy
this
was
my
first
urthel
offering
nice
intro
to
their
line
of
beers
up
next
hopit
but
not
tonight
large
bottle

a
worthy
belgian
brew
from
urthel
well
worth
seeking
out
and
enjoying
the
taste
is
truly
nice
with
hints
of
alcohol
and
fruits
permeating
the
mouth
most
beers
of
this
strength
can
be
a
slow
drink
but
urthel
has
created
a
very
drinkable
quadrupel
it
is
a
beer
that
can
be
drank
in
quantity
since
the
alcohol
is
there
but
not
as
strong
as
many
beers
of
this
caliber
i
highly
recommend
this
is
my
first
offering
by
urthel
and
i
am
quite
impressed
at
6
99
per
750
ml
of
this
i
will
surely
fall
back
on
this
as
something
to
treat
myself
to
every
now
and
then
although
this
was
quite
different
from
the
st
bernardus
abt
12
i
had
some
months
ago
and
i
really
dont
know
which
one
better
represents
the
style
i
found
this
to
be
uniquely
different
and
uniquely
delicious
d
not
a
bad
drink
im
drinking
it
slow
but
steady
recommended
find
someone
to
split
the
bottle
with
750ml
worth
of
this
rich
liquid
is
too
much
imho
for
one
person
aroma
is
strong
with
a
sour
mash
of
a
wide
variety
of
fruits
name
a
soft
fruit
and
this
smells
a
little
like
it
and
thext
seven
soft
fruits
you
can
name
definitely
leans
toward
the
exotic
ones
though
mango
papaya
guava
but
there
are
overripe
bannana
pear
notes
as
well
color
is
hazy
orange
head
is
fast
diminish
and
bubbly
white
fruityyeasty
fore
that
is
quite
soft
and
tasty
finish
is
all
hot
throat
burning
alcohol
but
its
works
with
the
flavores
here
playing
the
thorns
to
the
fruity
flavors
rose
gets
a
bit
spicy
just
before
the
finish
but
the
spice
notes
are
second
fiddle
to
the
exotic
fruit
mash
of
flavors
here
very
enjoyable
and
drinkable
big
belgian
beer
had
on
tap
at
brouwers
cafe
in
seattle
labeled
on
the
beer
list
as
urthel
quadrupel
so
i
am
assuming
this
is
it
came
in
the
proper
urthel
glassware
a
surprising
bright
candy
red
i
was
expecting
something
a
bit
darker
very
nice
looking
nonetheless
taste
was
strong
with
malts
mixed
with
yeast
born
fruitiness
alcohol
is
fairly
well
hidden
although
the
finish
is
quite
warming
a
much
different
beer
than
say
rochefort
10
an
interesting
beer
to
try
if
you
have
the
chance
opinion
i
am
at
a
bit
of
a
loss
as
to
how
to
describe
this
beer
i
like
the
flavor
for
the
most
part
but
i
am
thinking
that
it
is
a
little
off
i
am
thinking
that
there
was
a
bit
of
oxidation
that
is
causing
the
off
flavors
so
i
will
have
to
go
back
and
try
the
beer
again
to
see
if
that
was
the
case
regardless
i
would
have
a
hard
time
putting
this
beer
up
against
some
of
the
other
beers
listed
here
as
quads
so
far
i
am
much
more
partial
to
their
tripel
this
is
a
delicious
beer
huge
but
very
well
made
it
has
some
belgian
funk
but
not
much
malt
is
the
star
in
this
one
along
with
the
work
of
the
yeast
highly
recommended
mouthfeel
is
amply
carbonated
smooth
but
tart
and
the
11
5
abv
is
masked
very
well
very
drinkable
for
a
quad
perhaps
dangerously
so
an
excellent
offering
from
urthel
really
good
and
unique
strong
ale
this
beer
came
in
a
tulip
glass
with
a
slight
head
that
fell
to
ring
quickly
its
honey
gold
in
color
smells
of
apples
candy
sweet
malt
and
a
touch
of
spicy
yeast
tasted
of
oranges
honey
and
sweet
cream
the
finish
left
the
back
of
my
tongue
dry
with
hops
along
with
a
little
warming
mouth
feel
was
heavy
with
little
carbonation
i
wouldnt
be
surprised
if
the
colour
only
comes
from
dark
caramelized
sugar
its
a
well
balanced
spicy
fruity
firm
quad
that
really
sinks
its
teeth
into
ya
it
goes
down
just
right
for
its
higher
abv
and
will
hit
ya
late
as
it
dwells
in
the
head
recommended
body
medium
yet
dextrous
and
coating
mouthfeel
smooth
but
with
rough
edges
due
to
the
alcoholis
heat
very
happy
to
finally
have
this
available
to
me
drinkablility
was
good
on
this
one
but
just
a
little
too
over
the
top
to
be
a
regular
overall
impression
as
a
quad
its
a
bit
light
in
body
a
bit
lacking
in
depth
i
think
this
is
more
of
a
belgianenglish
barleywine
ok
i
cant
make
up
styles
but
i
really
think
thats
pretty
close
to
whats
going
on
here
i
enjoyed
this
over
the
course
of
a
sunday
afternoon
it
warms
wonderfully
both
me
and
in
terms
of
flavor
id
recommend
this
one
just
take
your
time
with
it
33c

sitting
on

i
had
intended
a

months
so
lets
see
where
it
takes
me
clear
copper
with
a
thin
ivory

surprisingly
no
yeast
in
the
bottle
tiny
bubbles
constantly
cascade
from
the
bottom
of
my
duvel
glass
keeping
the
lacing
intact
spicy
slightly
smoky
aroma
blends
with
bubblegum
and
apple
cider
taste
is
rather
onedimensional
the
hops
are
ever
present
at
the
start
but
nothing
seems
to
follow
but
the
warming
alcohol
finish
highly
acidic
and
quite
dry
in
the
finish
as
well
my
stomach
is
warm
the
alcohol
is
present
both
in
warmth
and
quickness
to
the
skull
watch
out
for
this
one
though
i
believe
any
beer
is
worth
trying
once
this
is
not
one
worth
seeking
out
in
my
opinion
if
you
can
find
this
you
can
certainly
find
better
belgian
examples
of
the

found
the

some

there
as

not

unfortunately
sweet

made
up
the

was
a

no

soso
definitely
at

carbonation

probably
a

too
much
with
some
subtle

in

background
yeast
is
very
present
and
may
hides
a
bit
of
overall
taste
of
this
alcohol
is
not
detectable
which
i
always
appreciate
from
brewers
great
for
the
style
but
still
not
up
there
with
the
greats
westy

thanks
to

once

drinkability
and
overall
wow
this
is
an
incredibly
quadrupel
altough
its
not
a
west

or
rochefort
10
its
still
a
wonderfully
complex
and
balanced
ale
that
in
a
few
years
will
be
out
of
this
world
killer
stuff
this
beer
was
listed
at
the
lucky
baldwins
belgian
beer
festival
as
a
barelywine
some
much
for
creative
names
whatever
you
call
it
this
beer
was
interesting
at
best
it
is
served
in
a
chimay
chalice
with
a
clear
yellow
color
and
a
thin
head
there
is
s
fruity
aroma
and
a
light
yeast
smell
to
go
along
with
the
barely
impressive
color
the
flavor
is
sweet
with
notes
of
citrus
candy
and
light
malts
it
did
not
taste
like
such
a
big
beer
kudos
to
the
brewer
for
being
able
to
hide
12
without
over
doing
the
flavor
as
impressive
as
that
may
be
i
still
was
not
terribly
impressed
with
the
flavor
of
this
beer
and
consider
it
slightly
above
average
at
best
this
750
ml
bottle
will
be
drained
with
astonishing
quickness
and
i
can
be
counted
for
picking
up
more
bottles
to
guarantee
future
happiness
pours
a
glowing
dark
amber
with
a
nicely
building
and
nicely
lacing
head
this
is
a
lot
like
a
barley
wine
as
brewed
by
the
belgians
its
got
that
sugary
sweet
caramel
flavor
common
to
many
british
style
barley
wines
think
jw
lees
harvest
ale
with
a
slight
bit
of
that
belgian
yeast
funk
theres
a
noticeable
bit
of
alcohol
in
the
aroma
and
flavor
but
it
complements
the
rest
quite
nicely
i
thought
this
was
top
notch
i
will
try
this
again
if
i
get
the
chance
to
have
it
on
tap
again
large

explosion
here
this
beer
pours
a
yellow
color
with
a
huge
head
that
has
great
retention
and
leaves
some
lacing
on
the
glass
lots
of
spices
in
the
aroma
the
flavor
is
very
spicy
as
well
some
caramel
malts
as
well
as
some
alcohol
finishes
with
a
lot
of
spices
very
good
this
is
really
how
i
like
a
belgian
to
be
shit
man
we
just
popped
the
cork
and
it
was
under
so
much
pressure
it
hit
the
ceiling
and
came
back
down
and
nailed
chris
before
we
knew
what
happened
that
is
the
most
explosive
popping
of
the
cork
that
i
have
ever
seen
the
beer
pours
very
heady
with
about
5
fingers
of
head
over
the
beer
that
dont
really
allow
us
to
get
the
contents
of
the
bottle
to
the
two
glasses
the
beer
pours
a
golden
amber
color
with
a
thick
head
that
stays
around
the
nose
is
light
raisin
and
tons
a
spiceys
the
flavor
is
much
more
intense
than
the
nose
would
tell
lots
of
good
raisin
followed
by
a
good
dose
of
alcohol
finishing
with
a
really
big
blast
of
spiceyness
the
feel
is
right
at
moderate
smooth
and
slightly
creamy
this
beer
has
an
aparent
alcohol
but
its
not
really
affecting
how
easily
it
goes
down
i
think
this
is
a
very
nice
beer
poured
into
a
rapscallion
glass
formed
a

head
over
the
light
copper
brew
head
is
resilient
with
good
lacing
aroma
is
yeasty
fruits
with
a
sweet
undertone
taste
is
initially
slightly
spicy
malt
which
gives
way
to
excessive
sweetness
alcohol
is
not
particularly
apparent
but
that
mouthful
of
sugar
could
hide
just
about
anything
mouthfeel
and
drinkability
both
quashed
by
the
sweetness
which
for
me
even
for
a
quadrupel
seemed
overthetop
worth
a
try
if
quads
are
your
thing
but
i
probably
wont
be
revisiting

really
comes
out
along
with
some
very
ripe
sweet
pineapple
even
noticed
a
little
chocolate
in
there
spicey
flavors
of
cinnamon
and
nutmeg
with
a
light
tropical
fruitiness
with
the

coming

you
have
to

smells
malty
and

with
some

smell
too
reminded
me
of
a
belgian
waffle
with
fruit
poured
over
the
top
strong
coconut
and
pineapple
as
well
the
flavor
has
the
hints
of
coconut
and
somewhat
musty
earthy
tone
strong
alcohol
flavors
through
out
and
a
watery
mouth
feel
a
finishing
tartness
brought
a
pouting
smile
to
my
lips
as
i
finished
my
last
sip
with
the
warring
angel
and
devil
at
my
shoulders
completing
their
battle
the
side
of
darkness
capitulated
with
whites
bald
statement
that
the
following
day
was
a
school
day
resonating
in
the
hollows
of
my
mind
this
belgian
quadrupel
ale
poured
a
very
slightly
hazy
amber
color
with
tall
pillowy
white
foam
that
persisted
very
nice
the
smell
was
mildly
fruity
banana
coconut
and
pineapple
there
was
some
caramel
and
a
bit
of
sweetness
in
the
aroma
as
well
the
taste
was
sweet
with
notes
of
caramel
malt
coconut
fruit
bananas
pineapple
as
the
beer
warmed
a
bit
of
alcohol
could
be
tasted
the
mouthfeel
was
smooth
but
with
an
initial
sharpness
it
was
sweet
with
medium
body
and
low
carbonation
feel
the
sweet
fruitiness
lingered
this
was
a
good
sipping
beer
enjoyable
appears
that
i
should
cellar
one
for
awhile
and
then
reassess
a
bit
brazen
and
sharp
at
this
point
i
thought
this
was
really
really
good
not
the
most
outstanding
brew
ever
but
very
good
had
it
first
last
friday
at
redbones
and
reading
my
notes
say
form
that
session
ill
be
honest
the
beer
sounds
decent
but
no
real
exclamation
points
now
on
the
next
evening
where
i
encounter
it
again
on
tap
at
anam
cara
i
got
to
drink
it
out
of
the
most
adorable
glass
ever
sorry
big
nose
gnome
like
fella
green
meadow
and
flowers
around
the
bottom
of
the
glass
of
course
the
proper
glass
made
cream
colored
head
about
10
ft
tall
ok
more
like
23
inches
anyway
the
presentation
brought
it
all
back
on
what
lept
out
at
me
on
the
intitial
sample
i
had
at
bones
before
i
ruined
my
pallet
with
another
brew
powdered
cinnamon
and
yeast
in
the
aroma
the
beer
had
an
orange
amber
glow
to
it
i
found
it
full
bodied
with
more
cinnamon
spice
in
the
taste
yeatiness
is
apparent
although
the
alcohol
sneaks
in
at
end
at
12
how
could
it
not
tasty
a
special
treat
blew
me

the
room
but

the
room

doesnt
quit

with
some
underlying
fruitness
to
it
shortly
like

a
definite

puncher
a
good
fruity
quad
some
that
should
be
considered
by
many
as
a
quality
highgravity
brew
drinkability
is
very
good
little
bit
lighter
that
some
quads
but
a
sloid
drinking
beer
update
i
got
a
hold
of
a
2010
this
really
is
a
fantastic
beer
and
unlike
others
of
the
style
is
not
overly
sweetened
theres
actually
some
mild
bitterness
here
that
balances
out
the
monster
malt
profile
this
really
is
a
fascinating
quad
and
i
never
get
tired
of
exploring
the
different
vintages
best
of
all
if
you
want
to
age
this
you
can
put
it
away
for
five
years
and
get
a
monster
sugarbomb
big
750

later
ones
are

and

spicy

along
with
a

smell
nice
heavy
cinnamon
sense
comes
on
in
the
flavor
quickly
but
so
is
an
impressive
bittering
that
gets
a
little
on
the
annoying
side
maltiness
is
good
up
front
some
sense
of
pear
and
cherry
but
the
body
seems
a
little
thin
for
as
big
a
beer
as
this
finishes
dry
with
alcoholic
heat
for
a
quad
i
was
surprised
how
bitter
and
dry
this
one
was
similarities
to
the
tripel
recipe
combined
with
the
alcohol
this
was
less
drinkable
than
i
was
expecting
well
the
cork
on
this
one
went
of
like
a
rocket
it
poured
an
clear
amber
color
and
formed
a
bubbly
white
head
that
left
circular
lace
as
it
subsided
a
medium
amount
of
carbonation
is
present
an
aroma
of
malt
caramel
and
spices
with
a
hint
of
ginger
the
flavor
was
of
malt
caramel
yeast
and
some
candy
sweetness
with
a
warming
aspect
of
the
alcohol
present
the
finish
was
a
bit
sprite
yet
sweet
with
a
hint
of
dryness
but
not
really
that
astrigent
another
pretty
good
beer
by
this
brewer
at
a
good
price
for
a
belgian
the
aftertaste
is
on
the
same
notes
fruity
and
warming
with
a
hop
bitter
in
the
finish
that
come
back
and
envelops
all
i
enjoyed
this
one
kinda
hard
to
find
good
quads
out
there
and
this
one
was
a
decent
example
my
only
complaints
for
this
one
are
that
the
alcohol
wasnt
as
balanced
as
i
would
have
liked
and
im
not
sure
why
sn
felt
it
necessary
to
add
plums
to
a
quad
not
wat
i
was
hoping
for
tasted
dry
overall
this
is
a
pleasant
surprise
i
was
expecting
a
very
fruit
forward
quad
but
the
dark
and
chocolate
malts
actually
maintain
a
great
balance
with
the
fruit
and
provide
a
pretty
awesome
drinking
experience
o
i
really
like
this
very
balanced
it
has
that
classic
quad
belgian
flavors
but
it
is
enhanced
with
a
nice
plum
dark
fruit
sweetness
warms
up
really
well
alcohol
is
hidden
pretty
good
definitely
going
to
pick
up
another
fourpack
deep
dark
brown
in
color
with
minimal
head
smell
is
dominated
by
molasses
vanilla
and
plum
with
a
minor
bit
of
bananas
and
bread
taste
is
similar
to
the
smell
with
fruit
sugar
and
roasted
notes
but
has
a
hoppy
finish
mouthful
is
heavier
with
no
carbonation
a
nice
american
quad
but
their
are
better
choices
out
available
o
a
beer
that
is
among
the
best
usmade
quads
but
really
cant
compete
with
the
elite
belgian
ones
like
rochefortbernardusvan
de
kaiserwestvleteren
straddles
the
line
a
bit
between
quad
and
belgian
stout
delicious
candied
plum
with
dark
sugar
and
bready
yeast
delicious
beer
all
around
fantastically
done
o
overall
outstanding
a
real
treat
delicious
my
kind
of
quad
love
the
sweetness
of
the
plums
and
the
booziness
cant
wait
to
see
how
this
develops
to
me
a
total
bargain
corked
and
caged
12
oz
bottles
for
around
3
bucks
per
preface
learning
to
taste
no
where
near
an
expert
i
poured
it
into
a
chalice
and
it
had
very
little
head
it
looks
to
be
about
a
36
on
the
srm
held
up
to
the
light
nothing
comes
through
after
agitation
you
definitely
get
the
sweetness
of
the
plum
for
taste
i
am
getting
some
sweet
maltiness
and
some
mild
bitterness
served
in
an
oversized
wine
glass
picked
this
up
and
tasted
on
3415
pours
a
very
dark
brownred
can
pick
up
the
plum
on
the
nose
taste
is
very
nice
can
pick
up
the
plum
influence
but
it
does
not
overpower
or
dominate
extremely
smooth
finish
no
hint
whatsoever
that
this
is
a
10
2
alcohol
would
highly
recommend
complex
in
flavor
yet
it
seems
to
become
simpler
as
the
glass
goes
on
nice
flavor
balance
nice
carbonation
nicely
done
comes
across
more
as
a
belgian
quad
leaning
toward
barleywine
qualities
the
sweet
elements
of
plum
dates
and
banana
combined
with
mild
alcohol
heat
without
the
latent
ashiness
of
most
belgian
styles
hit
the
spot
for
me
one
of
those
tastes
twice
as
good
when
half
finished
brews
dig
a
well
done
quad
great
mix
of
flavors
amazing
beer
the
smell
is
hypnotizing
taste
is
even
better
fine
brew
sorry
it
is
just
a
onetimer
probably
in
my
top
10
beers
overall
a
well
done
spot
on
quad
also
love
the
fact
that
sn
did
it
with
a
legit
belgian
collaboration
and
it
is
a
one
time
offering
which
adds
to
the
uniqueness
the
plums
set
this
one
apart
as
it
adds
layers
of
sweet
complexity
yeast
tasted
like
those
of
similar
belgian
greats
excellent
all
the
way
through
great
ale
with
smooth
hints
of
plums
othis
is
a
pleasant
albeit
somewhat
strange
beer
and
i
would
say
that
serving
it
just
to
the
left
of
cold
would
work
just
as
well
as
serving
it
could
it
leaves
a
warm
burn
in
the
stomach
and
a
sweet
taste
on
the
tongue
if
this
is
to
be
your
first
foray
into
quad
territory
better
go
with
st
bernardus
abt
12
instead
there
really
is
no
good
place
to
start
with
this
kind
of
beer
so
that
is
as
good
as
any
this
is
good
beer
and
an
interesting
beer
take
time
to
enjoy
it
and
the
experience
will
be
better
for
you
kicking
myself
for
not
buying
a
full
4
pack
a
year
ago
i
would
be
stoked
if
i
had
3
more
of
these
to
continue
to
age
out
amazing
plums
came
through
and
this
was
beer
of
2014
for
me
sweet
like
a
quad
should
be
so
pair
what
youre
eatingdrinking
accordingly
if
i
made
this
beer
i
too
would
wear
a
hood
so
that
nobody
would
know
i
made
it
lotta
people
with
no
taste
sheeples
jumping
on
the
bandwagon
sn
should
go
back
to
the
drawing
room
and
shoot
the
maker
overall
good
brew
drinks
similarly
to
red
wine
like
a
cab
or
zin
with
a
touch
of
carbonation
maybe
not
the
best
or
most
complex
quad
out
there
but
certainly
unique
i
wouldnt
be
opposed
to
drinking
it
again
020614
from
bottle
at
rattle
n
hum
nyc
this
is
a
superior
brew
but
if
your
not
a
fan
of
raisins
or
plums
or
prunes
stand
back
great
taste
complex
it
makes
you
think
of
foreign
lands
but
one
need
not
be
too
adventerous
to
appreciate
this
offering
do
it
you
will
not
be
sorry
btw
its
10
so
be
aware
i
aged
this
one
for
6
months
i
think
ill
age
the
remaining
4
bottles
for
2
years
and
see
what
happens
illinois
o
a
really
pleasant
fruity
malty
quad
o
superb
dessert
beer
would
pair
well
with
chocolate
darker
cakes
and
cheesecake
hints
of
coffee
and
the
lack
of
sickly
stickiness
on
the
finish
makes
this
one
of
the
better
quads
that
ive
had
o
i
really
like
this
style
and
its
well
done
by
sierra
nevada
yes
it
has
the
plum
theme
all
the
way
through

my
daughters
2nd
birthday
final
word
unfortunately
the
strong
alcohol
presence
got
in
the
way
of
the
other
flavors
in
this
beer
and
made
the
experience
feel
lopsided
while
the
black
liquorice
spice
dark
fruit
dark
sugar
and
chocolate
flavors
could
have
created
a
nuanced
drink
they
felt
as
if
they
were
crushed
and
compacted
under
the
weight
of
the
alcohol
flavor
had
they
been
allowed
to
bloom
and
expand
this
beer
would
have
been
very
complex
and
satisfying
but
instead
it
felt
like
every
sip
was
dominated
by
booze
it
was
as
if
each
sip
had
a
5050
blend
of
alcohol
flavor
and
one
random
flavor
contained
within
the
beer
youd
get
a
hint
of
raisin
in
one
sip
but
get
only
black
liquorice
in
the
next
and
the
flavors
never
seemed
to
mingle
the
potential
here
was
great
but
the
experience
felt
like
a
missed
opportunity
still
some
good
flavors
in
here
but
the
profile
is
much
too
alcoholic
for
the
subtle
flavors
within
even
for
a
quad
excellent
abbey
style
quad
from
sierra
nevada
pours
a
dark
roasted
brown
with
a
tannish
brown
off
white
head
that
gives
a
guinness
cascade
when
poured
with
a
slowly
dissipating
head
that
leaves
a
thin
tight
beaded
head
that
lightly
clings
to
the
glass
smell
of
chocolate
dark
plums
tart
cherry
and
astringent
grains
taste
is
of
dark
berries
cherries
raisins
plums
and
dark
malt
rounded
by
belgian
candy
sugar
aftertaste
is
pleasant
with
dark
chocolate
and
dark
fruits
and
a
slight
herbal
note
yeast
flavor
is
hard
to
find
with
everything
else
going
on
which
is
a
lotespecially
as
it
warms
silky
smooth
mouthfeel
and
very
deceptive
of
the
alcohol
another
aplus
from
sierra
nevada
brewing
a
favorite
i
have
had
many
times
in
bottle
but
could
not
pass
up
the
chance
to
have
on
draft
as
a
side
note
i
noticed
a
different
head
and
more
subtle
flavors
from
tap
than
bottle
for
what
its
worth
try
it
cheers
overall
a
good
and
strong
quad

prepared

some
strong

up

from
the

with

pleasantly
sweet
finish
yields
more
yeast
esters
along
with
slight
bitterness
it
isnt
as
complex
as
your
ideal
quads
but
i
think
the
plums
add
another
level
of
sweetness
mouthfeel
is
medium
somewhat
creamy
but
also
slightly
on
the
thin
side
overall
i
like
it
it
isnt
the
best
quad
ever
but
its
got
enough
yeast
and
the
plums
add
some
fruitiness
that
make
it
interesting
this
quad
definitely
caught
my
eye
the
first
time
i
saw
it
even
the
appearance
of
the
bottle
itself
was
appealing
to
me
i
absolutely
loved
the
artwork
on
the
label
and
the
cork
on
top
is
such
a
great
touch
the
beer
itself
has
a
thick
dark
appearance
with
a
tan
fizzy
head
when
poured
nothing
crazy
but
still
looks
satisfying
and
has
a
wonderful
smell
the
first
inhale
i
took
i
was
hit
by
a
rich
chocolaty
scent
with
a
slight
undertone
of
plum
finishing
out
with
a
smooth
hint
of
sourness
leading
into
my
first
taste
i
was
definitely
hit
by
the
bold
fruit
flavor
and
velvety
smooth
finish
it
was
rich
and
round
with
hints
of
fig
chocolate
and
spice
i
loved
this
beer
a
true
standout
from
other
belgianstyle
quads
ive
had
i
have
had
this
beer
a
few
times
and
realized
i
had
not
reviewed
it
yet
so
stuck
one
in
the
fridge
and
here
we
go
beautiful
beer
thick
and
dark
on
the
pour
and
then
thick
enough
appearance
to
get
me
salivating
the
smell
is
also
awesome
not
super
strong
but
clean
and
no
obvious
alcohol
despite
the
over
10
the
taste
is
very
good
and
gets
even
better
and
smoother
as
it
warms
take
your
time
and
enjoy
sipping
on
this
one
overall
it
gets
bonus
points
for
both
value
15
a
four
pack
i
believe
and
for
the
abv
which
does
not
come
on
strong
also
the
corked
12
oz
bottles
are
unique
and
cool
overall
a
really
nice
balanced
attack
of
sweet
and
bitter
with
loads
of
complex
flavors
a
big
beer
with
alcohol
warmth
from
the
first
sip
really
enjoy
the
big
plum
flavor
mixed
with
the
other
dark
fruits
a
real
winner
here
cant
wait
to
try
a
aged
bottle
o
as
i
mentioned
above
im
sure
this
was
a
lot
better
when
it
was
fresh
with
it
being
a
quad
i
didnt
feel
the
need
to
drink
it
right
away
and
figured
it
may
benefit
from
some
down
time
i
have
two
of
these
left
and
i
want
to
try
one
soon
to
se
if
this
may
be
a
bad
bottle
price
point
312
oz
single
a
nice
interpretation
of
a
quad
from
sn
but
not
up
to
level
of
the
classics
a
very
nice
smooth
and
tasty
dark
ale
new
aspects
of
flavor
and
feel
come
out
with
every
sip
and
all
are
enjoyable
subtle
deep
and
a
real
pleasure
to
savor
the
body
is
full
almost
thick
without
being
too
syrupy
as
a
dryness
opens
it
up
and
crispness
keeps
it
moving
and
biting
theres
a
light
acidity
and
the
alcohols
effect
on
the
body
keeps
it
from
doing
too
much
rather
than
detracting
from
it
i
usually
reserve
my
st
bernardus
chalice
gifted
to
me
during
my
only
visit
to
brawleys
in
charlotte
nc
several
years
ago
for
special
treats
of
which
i
am
hoping
the
ovila
abbey
quad
is
one
opens
up
with
a
light
pop
as
the
cork
is
freed
from
the
wire
cage
and
extracted
the
carbonation
is
light
and
the
beer
pours
very
dark
brown
looking
like
a
thick
cola
the
smell
is
filled
with
cherry
plum
and
other
dark
skinned
fruit
there
is
a
touch
of
hops
upon
deeper
inspection
of
the
smell
the
taste
has
more
of
a
brown
sugar
than
a
dark
fruit
type
sweetness
with
sour
notes
becoming
more
noticeable
mid
palette
before
being
swept
aside
by
the
alcohol
warmth
some
dark
chocolate
presence
in
the
finish
if
i
have
a
fault
to
pick
it
is
the
thinness
of
the
body
it
does
not
quite
seem
up
to
the
velvet
like
feel
of
others
in
the
style
i
like
the
ovila
quad
for
what
it
is
but
i
think
the
ovila
saison
is
better
overall
a
very
nice
quad
but
could
maybe
use
more
of
a
balance
between
alcohol
and
spice
a
good
quad
the
plums
give
a
great
taste
and
color
for
the
beer
taste
is
very
balanced
early
dark
fruit
spice
and
on
the
sweet
side
this
beer
is
very
enjoyable
to
drink
pours
a
pitch
black
in
color
with
a
thin
beige
head
that
leaves
some
streaky
lacing
when
sipped
the
aroma
is
very
pleasant
of
sweet
dark
fruits
brown
sugar
and
roasted
malts
the
taste
is
fantastic
with
a
lot
going
on
all
the
flavors
mentioned
above
coming
through
with
more
taste
as
well
of
some
caramel
malts
really
great
flavor
with
no
bitter
aftertaste
and
goes
down
easy
by
far
the
best
sierra
nevada
brew
i
had
overall
this
was
well
worth
the
price
of
admission
and
i
could
see
purchasing
a
four
pack
for
around
15
bucks
works
out
to
a
7
50
bomber
tasty
stuff
this
is
an
amazing
beercongrats
sn
o
a
tasty
beer
at
a
good
price
worth
trying
for
sure
id
have
it
again
overall
a
very
tasty
quad
and
one
thats
great
to
pair
with
food
but
as
noted
previously
its
not
very
complex
which
is
typically
a
hallmark
of
this
style
i
cant
help
but
feel
as
if
the
plums
are
crowding
out
everything
else
that
might
be
going
on
here
but
what
can
i
sayi
enjoyed
the
beer
this
beer
is
excellent
a
fruity
treat
for
dark
beer
lovers
i
work
at
a
liquor
store
and
traveled
to
another
store
before
we
got
it
in
highly
recommended
and
a
great
fun
story
behind
the
beer
smells
great
looks
great
taste
great
was
expecting
more
mouthfeel
due
to
the
color
and
smell
still
was
not
a
disappointment
my
new
wow
beer
for
sure
excited
to
hear
what
others
think
also
had
the
saision
and
it
was
excellent
plums
are
definitely
showing
through
here
kind
of
presents
a
sweet
and
somewhat
thicker
drinking
experience
could
be
toned
down
a
bit
on
the
plums
and
the
sweetness
but
it
works
pretty
much
smooth
feel
a
pretty
decent
quad
too
sweet
for
me
to
go
back
to
but
its
pretty
good
as
it
is
it
is
a
very
heavy
beer
at
10
2
abv
it
packs
a
punch
which
is
best
followed
up
by
a
glass
of
water
and
another
beer
dark
body
in
the
chalice
with
ruby
highlights
looks
great
big
head
tan
colored
rolling
with
fine
bubbles
it

deep
dark
fruits
of
course
with
the
plums
added
the
tart
ripened
fruit
holds
over
other
notes
flavor
dark
fruit
again
the
plums
are
added
to
bring
out
raisin
tart
dark
fruit
with
alcoholic
notes
more
and
more
big
fruit
flavors
with
each
sip
this
stuff
is
excellent
belgian
style
with
the
higher
carbonation
it
carries
it
all
very
well
each
sip
brings
out
chocolate
malt
with
high
end
spectrum
dark
fruits
a
mixture
of
dry
and
sweet
malts
add
to
the
balance
this
is
a
big
calorie
big
flavored
beer
mouthfeel
is
medium
to
full
even
flowing
carbonation
residual
sugars
lie
down
for
me
overall
its
a
big
beer
meant
to
be
enjoyed
by
the
masses
an
excellent
quad
love
the
addition
of
plums
overall
while
this
quad
is
a
bit
messy
i
enjoy
the
plum
flavor
im
not
sure
if
id
try
any
of
the
other
sn
ovila
line
but
i
enjoyed
this
one
o
really
good
stuff
much
better
than
the
saison
overall
i
have
not
been
this
pleasantly
surprised
with
a
beer
in
a
long
time
at
least
with
others
that
ive
bought
on
a
whim
lately
there
was
a
description
of
what
to
expect
here
i
didnt
even
look
it
up
on
ba
or
have
anything
to
go
off
of
other
than
the
bottles
description
i
am
so
glad
i
bought
this
i
suspect
i
may
buy
another
4
pack
to
age
the
taste
has
many
of
the
same
attributes
as
the
aroma
with
a
notable
sweetness
followed
by
a
notable
sinusclearing
bitterness
it
is
also
on
the
dry
side
i
bought
the
latest
release
of
this
beer
about
56
weeks
ago
and
it
is
a
wonderful
full
bodied
quad
i
didnt
think
i
was
going
to
like
it
when
i
saw
plums

this

medium

a

carbonated
the
flavors
on

are

of

certainly
in

this
is
a
decent
beer
unfortunately
for
it
i
would
drink
again
and
at
5
for
a
375ml
yeah
it
isnt
a
bad
example
of
the
style
overall
easy
to
drink
and
pretty
tasty
very
good
belgian
quad
ale

oz

conditioned
poured
into

pint
glass
great
bananas
aroma
very
smooth
12
abv
and
nice
belgian
quad
thoroughly
enjoyed
i
love
quads
so
therefore
i
was
eager
to
try
this
beer
unfortunately
it
is
a
bit
of
a
let
down
as
it
just
lacks
the
sophistication
of
most
belgian
quads
the
head
is
lacking
and
while
the
aroma
is
good
the
beer
is
way
too
sweet
very
nice
dried
fruit
and
clove
characteristics
with
alcohol
becoming
more
prominent
as
the
beer
warms
if
the
sweetness
could
be
dialed
back
a
bit
it
would
do
wonders
for
the
beer
loved
this
on
draft
it
was
slightly
out
of
style
but
thats
part
of
why
i
liked
it
so
much
a
golden
reddish
brown
brew
clocking
in
a
12
3
abv
its
very
well
hidden
and
quite
a
delight
to
drink
dark
fruit
aroma
dominates
the
nose
and
the
palate
and
is
coated
nicely
i
dontnever
have
claimed
to
be
a
fanpro
of
belgian
quads
but
i
found
smuttynoses
take
on
this
style
to
be
very
impressive
i
couldwould
recommend
this
offering
im
quite
impressed
with
smuttynoses
venture
into
the
world
of
quads
the
color
is
redishbrown
and
has
a
lovely
fruity
nose
the
flavor
is
very
sweet
for
a
quad
with
a
silky
mouthfeel
im
curious
to
spree
what
6
months
to
a
year
do
to
this

a

i
havent
been
drinking
a
lot
of
quads
this
one
seems
slightly
sweeter
than
average
to
me
but
a
very
average
brew
very
sweet
and
needs
a
bit
more
time
to
mellow
enjoyed
a
few
sips
then
it
was
too
cloying
deep
red
ale
all
of
12
lovely
drinker
out
if
a
tulip
simply
enjoy
o
nothing
to
write
home
about
though
it
will
certainly
get
you
drunk
overall
this
beer
is
no
traditional
quad
but
i
did
enjoy
it
quite
a
bit
i
rate
experimental
ipas
as
such
so
why
not
a
quad
too
id
say
this
is
a
tasty
beer
and
worthwhile
to
anyone
who
is
open
to
an
experimental
quad
the
boozy
and
raisin
aspects
combine
perfectly
to
for
a
tasty
big
brew
this
is
an
amber
colored
brew
a
bit
hazy
with
some
floaties
and
a
very
thin
head
the
alcohol
is
immediately
evident
it
has
a
boozy
maltintense
smell
there
is
some
yeast
and
hop
scent
in
the
aroma
as
well
along
with
a
huge
fruit
profile
i
got
peach
and
apricot
at
first
but
then
a
multilayered
spicebacked
complexity
came
forth
intense
the
taste
is
equally
big
and
powerful
serious
bitterness
and
lots
of
alcohol
warmth
the
alcohol
could
be
folded
in
a
bit
more
subtlely
but
the
brew
is
still
very
well
made
full
in
body
but
the
alcohol
warmth
is
distracting
from
the
mouthfeel
a
nice
big
brew
gravitation
is
a
good
american
quad
it
is
a
sipper
for
sure
22oz
bomber
this
one
pours
a
darker
caramel
color
there
was
almost
no
head
or
lacing
on
it
nice
nose
yeast
spices
caramel
dark
fruits
the
taste
is
very
good
some
sweet
caramel
malt
raisin
bready
and
a
hint
of
roast
and
chocolate
smooth
a
very
nice
beer
descent
quad
a
little
high
on
the
acid
and
ester
qualities
but
overall
pretty
solid
o
this
isnt
that
great
i
bet
that
it
would
mellow
out
and
allow
the
flavors
to
marry
after
a
year
or
so
if
you
decide
to
get
this
bottle
make
sure
you
sit
on
it
for
a
while
before
you
drink
it
overall
this
is
one
of
few
beers
that
i
simply
have
to
dump
out
as
others
have
said
it
is
a
mess
a
12
abv
beer
can
work
only
if
there
is
balance
and
the
effort
here
to
conceal
the
alcohol
with
the
super
sweet
raisin
and
fig
flavors
creates
an
unpleasant
experience
there
are
80
proof
liquors
that
dont
taste
this
alcoholic
tastes
potently
belgian
yeast
spicy
herbal
apricot
tropical
fruity
with
some
light
caramel
ends
with
a
peppery
zip
clean
alcohol
sting
is
drying
and
digs
a
small
amount
into
the
overly
sweet
malt
its
not
cloying
due
to
the
spicy
and
alcohol
but
its
not
far
from
it
medium
thick
in
the
mouth
with
modest
carbonation
too
much
for
this
to
be
an
abbey
ale
perhaps
a
trippel
in
the
malt
profile
super
sweet
chewy
beer
let
it
age
thats
the
short
review
appears
a
deep
amber
highlighted
golden
hue
with
khaki
head
forming
thick
head
clings
evenly
to
the
sides
of
the
glass
aroma
has
deep
fruit
think
ripened
apricot
figs
and
in
this
beers
case
loads
of
pureed
raisin
a
bit
of
alcohol
on
the
nose
brightens
things
up
a
bit
lets
you
know
what
your
dealing
with
a
big
ass
belgian
style
quad
to
balance
out
the
sweetness
im
smoking
a
roma
craft
anthropology
nicaraguan
rolled
big
ass
cigar
to
bring
some
earthy
spice
black
pepper
and
leather
into
the
mix
it
really
lets
the
beer
shine
the
contrast
between
dark
earthy
tobacco
leaves
and
these
dark
fruit
elements
i
speak
of
flavor
of
the
quad
is
super
sweet
it
just
sits
on
the
sides
of
the
tongue
its
big
chewy
and
flavorful
in
the
back
end
be
ready
for
some
alcohol
to
add
to
the
depth
this
bottle
i
bought
for
6
50
needs
to
be
laid
down
for
a
year
at
least
its
still
a
bit
hot
and
i
believe
the
overwhelming
layers
of
sweetness
will
mellow
out
body
is
big
bodacious
and
heavily
filled
with
residual
sugars
on
the
palate
its
big
and
definitely
burns
and
warms
your
chest
with
each
sip
overall
i
suggest
getting
some
2013
now
and
sitting
on
it
for
future
use
great
beer
now
will
only
get
better
with
some
mellowing
this
poured
a
murky
reddish
amber
with
a
thin
head
that
fell
fast
to
a
thin
ring
shimmering
wet
lace
and
alcohol
legs
little
yeast
floating
on
top
very
light
in
color
for
a
quad
looks
more
like
a
barleywine
nose
is
raisin
dark
fruits
plum
date
caramel
malt
candy
sugar
a
quick
glimpse
of
bread
but
really
more
cake
like
malt
and
alcohol
has
a
very
high
abv
taste
follows
the
nose
all
the
way
raisin
butter
and
rum
reminds
one
of
fruitcake
its
a
little
out
of
balance
with
no
bitter
at
all
and
lots
of
booze
its
immediately
warming
medicinal
and
has
just
a
bit
of
spice
mouthfeel
is
thin
and
has
a
sticky
fruit
juice
quality
to
it
this
is
a
big
sweet
beer
with
not
a
lot
of
carbonation
that
finishes
dry
from
all
the
booze
it
was
not
unpleasant
but
i
would
call
it
an
interpretation
on
the
belgian
quad
overall
a
very
good
quad
that
is
taste
appropriate
if
youre
in
the
mood
for
a
complex
belgian
style
this
one
wont
disappoint
2013
poured
in
a
tulip
the
beer
is
an
opaque
bright
orangeamber
coloring
with
a
thin
frothy
big
bubbled
offwhite
head
that
settles
into
a
filmy
coating
aromas
of
booze
toffee
and
biscuit
with
some
rich
berry
and
old
world
fruit
highlights
flavors
are
bold
and
rich
with
a
date
and
raisin
sweetness
that
overpowers
most
of
the
spicing
only
hints
of
all
spice
sneak
through
and
barely
the
booze
overpowers
all
of
the
flavors
and
deadens
some
of
the
palate
slick
and
smooth
in
mouth
the
beer
comes
off
a
bit
muddled
both
with
flavors
and
feel
the
aftertaste
is
richly
sweet
and
slightly
warming
with
a
smooth
midlingering
finish
not
bad
overall
quite
a
potently
sweet
and
big
beer
rather
tasty
but
nothing
too
exceptional
overall
a
nice
american
take
on
a
quad
very
comparable
to
those
belgian
versions
and
look
forward
to
more
of
this
in
the
future
might
have
to
get
another
to
store
for
a
few
years
o
the
alcohol
is
not
very
well
managed
this
is
a
big
warming
beer
the
aromas
are
great
the
flavors
are
good
up
front
but
the
finish
is
biting
but
overall
a
pretty
good
beer
another
american
quad
that
falls
short
on
all
levels
the
appearance
was
very
light
colored
for
a
quad
looked
like
a
watered
down
barleywine
brownish
red
with
no
head
at
all
smell
was
very
sweet
cherry
like
that
i
knew
right
away
was
gonna
be
cloyingly
sweet
with
some
booze
taste
and
mouthfeel
was
cloyingly
sweet
cherry
like
alittle
raisiny
and
thin
mouthfeel
the
only
thing
i
find
good
about
this
beer
was
the
high
alcohol
sort
of
a
weak
ass
troegs
mad
elf
this
quad
is
very
approachable
not
your
standard
bouquet
or
flavor
profile
but
still
unmistakably
belgian
in
influence
and
complex
and
portly
id
like
to
try
this
sidebyside
with
weyerbachers
to
see
which
one
i
like
better
this
ones
a
lot
easiergoing
in
a
good
way
o
an
average
brew
warming
still
a
little
hot
would
probably
benefit
from
a
year
or
two
in
the
cellar
overall
this
is
a
great
take
on
a
belgian
quad
its
to
be
expected
that
its
going
to
be
boozy
and
malty
and
high
in
alcohol
if
it
werent
then
it
wouldnt
be
advertised
as
a
quad
all
in
all
id
say
its
a
pretty
tasty
brew
but
if
im
looking
for
a
delicious
beer
thats
the
same
style
im
just
going
to
go
out
and
buy
a
12oz
rochefort
10
and
not
worry
about
spending
the
extra
bucks
on
a
bomber
wish
i
picked
up
the
bomber
of
zinneke
instead
of
gravitation
but
alas
it
was
still
pretty
damn
tasty
o
could
stand
to
be
a
little
drier
like
the
classic
quads
but
this
doesnt
taste
bad
at
all
overall
glad
i
picked
up
a
bottle
of
this
and
can
imagine
it
sitting
well
in
the
cellar
a
little
less
complex
than
some
of
the
authentic
belgian
quads
but
still
a
very
big
beer
o
nice
and
complex
for
an
americanbrewed
quad
with
decent
drinkability
right
now
definitely
see
this
one
getting
better
with
age
as
the
alcohol
mellows
and
the
maltiness
can
shine
more
as
always
with
the
smuttynose
big
beer
series
the
bombers
are
priced
very
nicely
so
you
might
as
well
get
a
few
and
throw
them
in
the
cellar
first
impression
is
the
presence
of
the
belgian
yeast
strong
and
potent
highly
carbonated
with
a
round
almost
skim
milk
consistency
very
much
like
the
traditional
belgian
pale
ale
the
finish
is
mildly
sweet
with
a
strong
alcohol
presence
overall
not
as
good
as
some
quads
ive
had
but
has
a
nice
blend
of
flavors
and
the
alcohol
isnt
too
in
your
face
i
like
it
o
dont
really
understand
the
low
score
on
this
one
i
think
this
is
a
solid
quad
with
an
added
bonus
of
the
raisin
puree
i
think
smuttynose
was
simply
playing
with
the
dark
fruit
aspect
of
many
a
great
belgian
quads
that
being
said
this
one
is
enjoyable
to
say
the
least
a
must
try
maybe
not
but
a
solid
beer
nonetheless
pours
a
deep
cola
brown
color
with
a
small
quick
fading
head
that
leaves
a
few
bubbles
on
top
pretty
dark
for
a
quad
smell
is
sweet
and
full
of
sugar
and
raisins
very
pleasant
smelling
taste
is
very
good
nice
sweetness
up
front
with
some
bitter
malts
to
finish
the
taste
raisins
and
plums
dominate
the
flavor
mouthfeel
is
medium
bodied
and
good
carbonation
overall
i
enjoyed
this
very
good
quad
o
im
finding
it
extremely
hard
to
enjoy
this
beer
which
brings
to
mind
smuttynoses
wheat
wine
which
similarly
tasted
of
alcohol
and
sugar
putting
the
raisin
flavors
aside
this
tastes
and
feels
more
like
a
flat
rum
and
coke
than
a
beer
o
is
it
true
to
style
who
the
fuck
cares
its
delicious
besides
the
quad
style
is
a
moving
target
this
2011
edition
is
pretty
big
12
5
but
not
as
syrupy
as
the
2010
version
thanks
to
the
candi
sugar
also
while
i
found
this
beer
to
have
a
characteristic
alcohol
hotness
when
it
was
fresh
like
many
of
the
smutty
big
beers
eight
months
in
the
cellar
has
done
wonders
for
this
brew
in
that
regard
d
very
drinkable
lots
of
dark
fruit
and
residual
sugar
sweetness
but
enough
body
and
booze
to
provide
some
balance
originally
reviewed
10032011
theres
a
warming
effect
especially
as
the
beer
opens
up
and
is
allowed
to
linger
on
the
palate
its
a
wonderful
wonderfully
complex
brew
even
if
it
dares
defy
styles
ill
have
another
overall
this
is
a
cohesive
and
approachable
beer
with
a
few
surprises
that
are
easily
appreciated
o
too
rich
for
my
taste
overall
the
flavor
of
this
beer
is
quite
nice
hits
the
dark
fruit
belgian
dark
flavor
very
nicely
a
more
than
acceptable
quad
this
thing
comes
nowhere
near
being
in
style
with
a
belgian
quad
it
should
be
called
belgian
style
nail
polish
due
to
abundance
of
detectable
alcohol
overly
cloying
tongue
slapping
and
a
step
away
from
being
a
malt
liquor
with
grape
flavoring
feel
again
is
a
bit
rich
for
the
style
as
i
prefer
a
better
attenuated
quad
complexity
is
also
a
bit
lacking
on
the
finish
on
the
flip
side
this
beer
does
gain
strength
as
it
warms
into
the
60s
i
would
guess
but
im
not
sure
its
worth
the
calories
o
this
beer
was
recommended
to
me
at
the
distributor
since
i
enjoy
belgian
quads
but
when
i
read
somewhere
about
raisin
puree
being
used
i
was
a
little
put
off
however
as
i
drank
the
22
oz
bomber
boy
was
i
happy
really
strong
really
sweet
really
soft
and
really
tasty
a
true
treat
and
not
what
i
have
usually
had
in
a
quad
not
that
ive
had
that
many
and
i
get
that
there
are
many
different
styles
within
the
category
i
would
definitely
have
this
again
i
know
this
sounds
weird
but
this
is
a
yummy
beer
o
not
as
vibrant
as
the
aged
on
tap
experiences
ive
had
i
still
love
old
malt
bombs
like
this
though
but
ba
has
hardened
my
once
happy
golucky
beer
raving
about
common
treats
like
this
from
now
on
im
waxing
all
of
these
as
soon
as
i
get
them
o
this
beer
has
a
big
yeast
character
and
some
nice
malt
support
with
a
full
alcohol
heat
that
is
not
harsh
but
dominates
overall
its
a
decent
but
not
real
interesting
quad
a
little
one
sided
with
sweet
raisiny
booze
pretty
good
value
but
bettter
quads
to
be
had
for
sure
22oz
bomber
poured
reddishbrown
with
a
foamy
tan
head
that
dissipated
quickly
as
expected
for
the
abv
aromas
are
sweet
and
boozy
with
caramel
and
toffee
not
much
belgian
tastes
are
sweet
and
boozy
once
again
complex
notes
of
toffee
candi
sugar
caramel
brown
sugar
and
raisin
reminds
me
of
liquid
butter
toffee
not
as
much
belgian
influence
as
id
hoped
for
mouthfeel
is
buttery
and
smooth
fullboded
and
syrupy
finishes
sweet
with
a
slight
prickle
on
the
palate
from
the
alcohol
which
is
relatively
well
concealed
given
the
massive
abv
overall
i
really
enjoyed
this
but
it
seemed
to
lack
the
belgian
qualities
i
was
expecting
for
a
quad
it
seemed
to
be
a
great
american
strong
ale
at
best
it
is
still
worth
the
try
if
you
can
find
it
as
i
really
did
enjoy
it
again
just
not
what
i
expected
oone
of
the
few
quads
ive
had
with
banana
flavors
the
dark
fruits
i
normally
associate
were
there
as
well
but
this
one
had
a
nice
touch
of
banana
overall
just
ok
its
a
bit
rough
at
times
gravitation
pours
a
dark
amber
color
with
a
small
head
that
dispated
quickly
there
was
a
strong
sweet
grape
like
smell
the
taste
was
heavy
a
bit
warm
and
on
the
sweeter
side
the
raisins
can
easily
be
picked
up
it
was
deffently
more
of
a
sipping
beer
overall
gravitation
is
a
good
beer
close
to
a
barley
wine
in
flavor
but
still
very
enjoyable
m
medium
co2
a
touch
of
stickiness
overall
this
is
the
best
beer
i
encountered
from
the
big
beer
series
massive
abv
smooth
taste
and
great
flavor
for
under
6
bucks
almost
beats
out
victory
v12
but
i
enjoy
that
beer
in
its
own
right
will
have
to
give
a
bottle
to
my
brother
since
he
like
quads
definitely
consider
getting
it
again
drink
it
cold
if
you
can
bomber
from
half
time
poured
a
clear
reddish
amber
with
a
lasting
amber
head
aromas
of
carmel
toffee
plum
raisin
pear
banana
and
light
spice
palate
was
medium
to
full
bodied
and
smooth
with
a
dry
finish
flavors
of
toffe
carmel
dark
fruit
and
light
spice
with
a
smooth
dry
warming
lingering
toffee
finish
poured
into
a
chimay
goblet
theres
a
pork
and
pickle
sandwich
next
to
it
too
yum
its
murky
amber
and
has
a
tiny
head
dissipating
into
a
broken
ring
i
smell
a
bunch
of
sweet
fruits
and
heavy
booze
everyone
else
is
saying
they
used
raisin
puree
in
this
beer
and
i
have
an
easy
time
believing
this
its
also
obvious
with
every
sip
that
this
is
12abv
sometimes
my
sip
tastes
like
jam
on
toast
but
sometimes
it
tastes
like
paint
if
i
swish
it
around
in
my
mouth
it
feels
like
i
took
a
hit
of
some
pop
rocks
which
i
guess
is
sort
of
cool
overall
i
dont
regret
picking
this
up
but
im
not
very
stoked
about
it
i
dont
think
it
does
belgian
quads
justice
but
at
least
it
tastes
good
with
my
hot
pork
it
has
that
belgian
fruity
malty
yeasty
thing
going
but
good
not
much
is
disguised
or
subtle
it
works
better
than
some
other
recent
tastes
which
leads
me
to
wonder
what
it
would
be
like
if
i
set
a
couple
of
these
aside
for
a
year
which
i
think
i
will
do
o
does
the
job
well
but
could
use
a
little
more
personality
o
it
was
ok
the
alcohol
presence
made
it
very
difficult
to
drink
and
got
worse
as
it
warmed
the
flavors
were
ok
the
raisin
puree
overpowered
a
lot
of
it
i
think
though
rich
syrupy
palate
enhances
the
raisin
and
pruney
fruits
flavors
of
this
beer
the
middle
to
finish
brings
out
that
fruity
pound
cake
toasted
malt
flavor
along
with
a
well
integrated
alcoholic
heat
on
the
finish
great
nightcap
sipper
its
a
beautiful
color
and
has
a
strong
fruity
scent
but
is
overwhelmingly
boozy
and
taste
too
strong
of
alcohol
a
bit
too
complex
and
strong
for
this
hop
seeker
o
definitely
worse
than
the
reverend
but
its
still
pretty
decent
like
stated
before
its
an
interesting
experiment
its
not
really
a
great
example
of
a
quad
but
im
glad
i
tried
it
not
for
the
faint
of
heart
but
at
6
per
bottle
there
really
isnt
any
reason
not
to
try
it
if
you
havent
before
this
is
a
decent
enough
quad
but
it
doesnt
stand
up
to
the
giants
of
the
style
pannepot
and
the
various
trappist
quads
still
if
you
see
a
bottle
available
it
would
be
an
interesting
experiment
in
cellaring
pours
a
clear
dark
mahogany
brown
with
a
fairly
thick
pale
tan
head
strong
aroma
has
fruity
caramel
butterscotch
and
woody
notes
with
hints
of
molasses
and
licorice
whoa
that
is
one
strong
flavor
jumping
on
the
taste
buds
with
banana
apple
caramel
and
malt
notes
plus
hints
of
wood
butterscotch
horehound
and
wood
it
is
fairly
sweet
but
not
cloying
and
has
quite
a
strong
alcohol
bite
lively
edgy
texture
has
nearfull
body
and
leaves
a
sweet
fruity
slightly
candylike
finish
let
this
beers
gravitational
field
draw
you
in
o
maybe
a
couple
of
years
on
this
bottle
would
work
wonders
but
as
is
its
a
mess
i
wouldnt
suggest
this
to
anyone
especially
not
as
an
introduction
to
quads
i
wouldnt
want
anyone
thinking
this
is
what
a
belgian
quad
should
taste
like
the
mouthfeel
is
on
the
heavier
side
with
carbonation
being
moderate
overall
it
was
a
decent
beer
but
not
an
outstanding
one
of
the
style
it
felt
a
little
unbalanced
to
me
at
times
with
the
sweet
malty
flavors
being
a
little
too
dominant
overall
a
pretty
decent
tasting
beer
but
not
outstanding
in
the
style
equally
rich
flavors
some
velvety
maltiness
and
dried
fruits
like
dates
banana
sultanas
nutty
almond
walnut
and
pecan
flavors
too
feel
is
rich
medium
bodied
with
lower
carbonation
dry
finish
with
lingering
toffee
and
raisinsultana
flavors
not
at
all
cloying
alcohol
does
creep
up
a
bit
leaving
a
warming
sting
this
eventually
limits
drinkability
but
its
likely
best
shared
anyway
7
bomber
is
a
deal
smuttynose
gravitation
quadrupel
is
a
fantastic
beer
with
a
noticeable
raisin
aroma
served
at
tap
mallet
of
rochester
in
a
8
5
oz
glass
had
a
very
thin
head
and
a
deep
burgundy
color
on
the
nose
the
first
aromas
are
of
raisins
and
molasses
at
12
abv
the
first
taste
warns
you
that
this
is
a
high
alcohol
beer
soon
afterwards
the
flavors
of
raisins
molasses
and
a
hint
of
honey
lull
you
into
a
false
sense
that
the
alcohol
is
not
that
high
this
beer
in
the
mouth
gives
you
a
slight
effervensce
and
syruppiness
i
really
love
this
beer
served
with
a
nice
tan
thick
foamy
head
that
subsides
after
a
bit
to
a
ring
and
islands
color
is
a
hazy
dirty
copper
aroma
is
malt
fruit
yeast
caramel
toffee
flavor
is
massively
maltfruit
sweet
with
a
little
bitterness
and
very
little
carbonic
tang
body
is
full
round
lush
but
carbonation
is
kinda
flat
finish
is
like
flavor
with
a
big
alcohol
warming
factor
pours
a
dark
brown
color
w
a
thin
one
finger
cocoa
head
the
head
quickly
goes
down
to
a
sliver
decent
lacing
on
my
snifter
glass
as
well
this
beer
isnt
a
black
hole
and
you
can
see
the
carbonation
swirling
around
when
held
to
the
light
in
the
nose
i
get
caramel
malt
raisin
date
fig
pretty
tasty
smelling
although
not
quite
in
the
realm
of
the
best
in
style
the
thing
im
missing
in
this
brew
is
belgian
yeast
its
like
a
gaping
hole
in
an
otherwise
solid
brew
taste
is
the
same
as
the
nose
with
the
raisins
and
figs
really
coming
out
slight
alcohol
burn
on
the
aftertaste
but
i
like
that
in
big
beers
mouthfeel
is
a
little
on
the
thindry
side
for
what
id
like
but
its
not
bad
overall
this
is
a
pretty
decent
brew
definitely
not
a
world
class
quad
but
i
enjoyed
it
cheers
definitely
better
at
room
temperature
full
flavored
and
full
bodied
the
12
abv
demands
sip
me
personally
i
think
the
raisins
meld
perfectly
with
this
belgianh
ale
as
emeril
would
say
kick
it
up
a
notch
it
seems
my
sample
performed
quite
differently
from
other
reviewers
fresher
or
reformulated
maybe
overall
i
am
not
sure
i
got
the
experience
i
was
looking
for
generally
i
relish
the
taste
of
a
good
beer
but
i
also
like
the
story
that
goes
with
it
by
that
i
like
it
when
you
can
tell
a
brewery
has
had
some
fun
and
let
the
creative
juices
flow
when
putting
together
their
product
this
is
why
stone
products
to
me
are
enjoyable
ok
you
can
do
better
mouthfeel
is
thick
and
chewy
overall
smuttynose
makes
a
fine
beer
here
but
its
hard
to
compare
this
quad
with
the
likes
of
rochefort
st
bernardus
and
pannepot
still
at
6
a
bomber
its
a
nice
bold
and
boozy
beer
to
sip
on
for
a
while
overall
its
a
an
decent
beer
but
an
average
american
quad
and
would
probably
fall
to
below
average
if
you
stack
it
against
all
quads
read
belgians
ok
drinkability
as
it
is
moderately
enjoyable
just
doesnt
compare
to
the
kings
in
the
style
the
rochefort
10s
abt
12s
or
westys
of
the
world
poured
into
my
duvel
vijf
20
oz
large
tulip
very
attractive
dark
ruby
with
a
half
inch
of
mellow
off
white
head
minimal
lacing
crazy
banana
clover
dark
fruits
raisin
mostly
hard
candy
and
some
booze
taste
is
all
that
and
very
pungent
not
a
huge
fan
of
style
but
this
is
a
solid
version
for
my
taste
i
like
this
beer
but
not
easy
drinking
at
all
o
only
my
second
quad
i
liked
it
but
wouldnt
want
more
than
46
oz
at
a
time
in
the
future
and
the
only
other
quad
ive
ever
had
brewery
ommegangs
was
better
definitely
share
this
one
with
friends
way
too
much
to
have
on
your
own
especially
given
that
its
only
available
in
bombers
i
have
a
2009
vintage
bottle
in
my
cellar
and
since
sat
night
was
a
special
occasion
and
a
hurricane
rolled
into
one
i
decided
to
open
it
still
a
ton
of
carbonation
left
popped
the
cap
and
the
foam
slowly
crept
to
the
top
and
just
dribbled
over
the
top
poured
into
the
chalice
glass
very
slowly
to
avoid
overflow
crisp
bubbly
carbonation
like
soda
dark
garnet
ruby
color
good
head
and
nice
amount
of
lacing
the
aroma
just
fills
your
nose
with
cherry
the
taste
was
quite
sweet
flavors
of
dark
fruit
were
striking
cherry
fig
plum
and
raisins
very
sugary
also
which
took
away
from
the
mouthfeel
a
bit
it
was
thick
and
somewhat
cloying
on
the
palate
but
overall
i
liked
this
beer
i
remember
when
this
beer
first
came
out
people
were
saying
this
beer
was
too
hot
with
the
abv
and
needed
some
aging
after
two
years
it
certainly
mellowed
out
a
bit
without
losing
any
flavor
this
was
a
nice
beer
on
a
rainy
night
paired
with
a
chocolate
dessert
o
overall
a
very
good
beer
very
tart
cherry
now
especially
in
the
taste
not
sure
how
it
is
fresh
but
this
batch
is
tasting
awesome
had
2
glasses
of
it
and
would
like
to
try
it
again
obviously
at
12
this
is
a
bit
much
to
chug
but
its
a
nice
slow
sipper
i
love
smuttynose
and
have
loved
the
big
beer
series
thus
far
this
isnt
one
of
the
alltime
great
quads
but
its
still
very
good
ive
become
a
big
fan
of
smuttynose
brewing
company
unfortunately
gravitation
is
not
one
of
smuttynoses
finer
moments
in
fact
its
their
worst
beer
that
ive
encountered
the
biggest
problems
here
are
the
complete
lack
of
belgian
yeast
and
the
overbearing
alcohol
those
arent
small
mistakes
when
it
comes
to
brewing
a
belgian
quad
as
a
result
this
is
a
very
average
take
on
the
style
this
one
needs
a
bit
of
work
notes
ive
had
this
beer
before
and
i
could
swear
it
was
totally
different
this
time
around
and
this
was
after
the
recipe
change
and
hikeup
to
12
abv
this
is
an
under
carbonated
cloying
boozy
mess
and
thats
after
about
8
months
of
cellar
time
too
the
first
time
i
had
it
i
probably
would
have
rated
it
a
solid
b
i
dont
know
if
i
got
an
off
bottle
or
what
but
this
was
pretty
terrible
i
might
have
to
revisit
it
but
im
kind
of
dreading
that
prospect
this
is
the
first
beer
by
smuttynose
that
i
did
not
enjoy
this
beer
was
a
big
disappointment
for
me
after
all
i
love
smutty
and
i
never
could
have
expected
that
they
could
produce
something
bad
but
this
is
not
a
good
beer
its
not
a
good
representation
of
the
quad
style
and
it
just
tastes
like
nasty
grape
jelly
still
its
better
than
drinking
a
corona
d
surprisingly
this
beer
is
very
drinkable
for
the
style
and
its
high
amount
of
alcohol
contentthe
body
isnt
very
heavy
and
the
alcohol
is
well
masked
from
the
taste
exactly
what
i
wanted
when
i
cracked
this
bottle
rich
thick
and
decadent
i
wasnt
prepared
for
such
a
syrupy
brew
but
i
managed
what
it
lacks
in
dimension
it
makes
up
for
in
satisfaction
terrific
quad
gravitation
is
packed
with
flavor
and
enough
complexity
to
impress
well
worth
a
go
it
more
than
holds
its
own
as
a
fine
representative
of
the
style
one
of
the
best
offerings
from
smuttynose
exciting
mix
of
flavors
absolutely
delicious
but
too
strong
for
regular
consumption
pours
a
somewhatstrange
purplishred
color
with
a
bit
of
muddiness
in
there
bit
of
a
creamy
head
with
some
moderate
lacing
the
nose
is
actually
quite
nice
with
a
good
amount
of
sweetness
booze
and
dark
fruits
a
bit
of
molasses
there
as
well
the
taste
falls
back
a
bit
from
here
and
doesnt
offer
all
that
much
a
bit
of
alcohol
the
body
is
fairly
full
with
lowish
levels
of
carbonation
drinkability
is
pretty
good
nothing
really
stands
out
in
this
one
though
there
arent
any
glaring
defects
either
poured
a
deep
amberbrown
in
my
st
bernardus
goblet
a
brief
beige
head
topped
the
liquid
with
no
lace
swirled
and
poured
the
sediment
in
as
well
but
it
was
quite
clear
before
that
aroma
is
very
nice
hint
of
cocoa
lots
of
caramel
and
deep
dark
fruit
fairly
complex
with
notes
of
toffee
dates
and
figs
nice
alcohol
to
balance
the
flavor
and
aromas
beautifully
carbonated
mellow
and
smooth
a
medium
bodied
beer
that
leaves
a
light
coating
over
the
palate
sweet
finish
that
brings
out
the
caramel
hint
of
warmth
from
the
alcohol
very
well
made
and
it
has
aged
gracefully
medium
bodied
with
soft
carbonation
up
front
and
an
overly
sweet
estery
dark
fruit
flavor
that
is
a
bit
cloying
slightly
earthy
with
sublte
hops
and
spice
as
well
as
hints
of
raisin
grape
and
dark
cherry
theres
a
prominent
malt
backbone
that
provides
decent
balance
but
this
beer
kind
of
reminds
me
of
grape
soda
far
from
my
favorite
smuttynose
brew
and
ive
had
many
better
quads
but
for
5
50
a
bottle
its
still
a
solid
beer
d
this
has
pretty
good
drinkability
it
is
a
slow
sipper
for
sure
but
i
think
its
pretty
easy
going
i
like
this
more
than
i
thought
i
would
after
reading
some
of
the
reviews
on
here
i
am
glad
i
picked
this
one
up
and
i
recommend
trying
it
d
told
alex
to
finish
it
off
i
got
through
about
half
of
one
glass
too
hot
too
bad
tasting
just
not
a
good
beer
the
search
for
the
great
american
quad
continues
d
it
was
a
struggle
for
mike
and
i
to
finish
this
although
i
eventually
manned
up
and
got
the
job
done
not
something
i
would
have
again
although
there
is
a
serious
dearth
of
good
american
quads
d
really
good
quad
alc
isnt
that
well
hidden
but
it
works
really
enjoyable
and
easy
to
drink
an
amber
beer
with
the
gravity
that
is
visible
in
the
way
the
bottles
are
trying
to
work
there
way
to
the
surface
about
5
seconds
delayed
of
about
three
finger
nails
worth
nose
of
booze
and
apple
brown
sugar
palate
of
raisin
and
metal
that
fades
over
time
apple
and
burnt
clove
hurts
the
teeth
so
much
sugar
and
poor
body
nothing
worth
trying
from
a
otherwise
pretty
successful
lineup
served
from
22
oz
bottle
into
chimay
goblet
not
something
i
could
drink
a
whole
lot
of
but
is
something
that
could
be
split
and
sipped
on
for
a
while
too
sweet
for
my
liking
and
that
says
alot
a
22oz
bottle
is
impossible
to
finish
i
doubt
i
could
even
finish
a
12ozer
sweet
cloying
sticky
chewy
like
a
liquefied
jam
not
enjoyable
and
not
acceptable
i
need
to
see
my
dentist
stat
drinkability
very
easy
to
drink
but
dont
plan
on
drinking
more
than
one
of
these
drinkability
is
not
good
at
all
a
couple
ounces
of
this
beer
is
plenty
22
oz
is
way
too
much
unless
you
are
drinking
with
a
group
tons
of
alcohol
in
the
flavor
doesnt
hide
it
at
all
d
not
all
that
enjoyable
way
too
sweet
impossible
to
finish
a
glass
drinks
like
the
sarafijn
donker
from
bruwerij
achilles
or
a
supersweet
nutbrown
neither
of
those
are
compliments
drinkability
i
actually
really
enjoy
some
aspects
of
this
flavor
profile
though
its
definitely
got
a
bit
of
heat
and
bit
boozy
at
this
stage
but
the
malt
flavor
to
me
up
front
is
quite
enjoyable
i
do
like
this
beer
but
its
very
strong
and
far
from
fast
drinker
a
good
beer
not
great
at
this
point
but
decent
this
is
a
nice
beer
definitely
something
to
drink
in
a
snifter
though
after
dinner
with
a
friend
an
excellent
dessert
drinkability
is
low
due
to
the
abv
of
12
and
little
else
flavorwise
going
on
id
have
to
say
it
does
not
live
up
to
a
belgian
quadrupel
in
flavor
only
in
the
alcohol
blitz
which
unlike
belgian
quads
is
not
matched
by
a
diversity
of
interestingly
complex
flavors
maybe
it
would
be
better
for
smuttynose
to
just
say
it
is
a
raisin
beer
like
dogfish
heads
raisin
dextrabut
that
would
not
garner
any
extra
points
either
it
begs
the
question
why
do
people
not
like
raisin
beers
are
raisins
too
foreign
an
adjunct
to
beer
s
well
my
room
smells
pretty
good
right
now
but
in
the
glass
this
beer
is
pretty
weak
its
g
i
wasnt
super
impressed
with
this
one
which
is
a
shame
because
i
typically
have
really
enjoyed
the
smutty
big
beer
series
this
one
whiffs
though
at
the
style
pours
a
murky
dark
brown
with
very
little
head
that
recedes
to
a
small
ring
around
the
glass
fruity
aroma
big
on
the
graperaisindate
aromas
some
sticky
malt
to
back
it
up
taste
is
a
one
note
raisin
flavor
largely
unsupported
by
other
elements
wheres
the
character
sweet
sticky
onenote
not
exactly
my
expectation
of
a
quad
undercarbonated
as
well
this
one
should
be
pillowy
but
it
falls
flat
just
being
sticky
in
the
mouth
ok
drinkability
though
it
is
very
sweet
and
ultimately
not
very
interesting
i
love
the
smutty
bbs
but
this
one
misses
thick
and
brown
but
this
is
not
the
best
representative
of
my
favourite
style
a
certain
richness
from
the
raisins
but
not
overly
complex
still
good
drinkability
maybe
this
is
unfair
but
men
should
not
consume
raisins
as
it
is
not
easy
to
get
rid
of
the
iron
pours
a
slightly
murky
brown
with
little
head
what
head
there
is
fades
away
to
a
very
thin
ring
smells
extremely
fruity
with
cherry
plum
and
raisin
notes
the
taste
is
similar
but
with
a
brown
sugar
sweetness
throughout
as
well
the
mouthfeel
is
smooth
rich
and
slightly
sweet
not
bad
but
a
little
simplistic
were
major
smutty
fans
across
the
board
so
it
pains
us
deeply
to
criticize
but
this
is
nowhere
near
a
belgian
quad
unfortunately
everyone
will
compare
this
to
a
quad
as
thats
what
they
call
it
on
the
label
and
they
failed
to
mention
the
most
unique
ingredient
used
in
the
beerraisin
purée
that
said
kudos
for
creating
something
innovative
drinkability
a
damn
tasty
sipper
one
thats
more
spicily
balanced
than
anything
this
isnt
authentic
of
course
but
it
seems
like
they
dont
want
it
to
be
with
the
raisins
and
that
combination
with
the
yeast
yields
pretty
awesome
results
undoubtedly
id
hope
this
would
hold
up
well
for
a
few
years
and
if
i
can
find
it
ill
be
snagging
at
least
another
bottle
or
two
to
cellar
for
sure
mouthfeel
is
full
bodied
sticky
juicy
sugary
and
syrup
like
in
the
swallow
a
bit
of
booze
found
in
this
one
i
could
only
imagine
what
an
aged
sample
would
complex
in
5
10
even
15
years
grandiose
pours
a
fairly
clear
ruby
color
with
thin
offwhite
head
couple
of
blobs
of
lace
smell
dark
brown
sugar
raisin
date
not
particularly
complex
but
its
pretty
intense
taste
caramel
raisin
date
plum
skin
raisin
definitely
shows
up
along
with
a
semitart
plum
skin
again
pretty
straightforward
but
good
and
not
all
that
sweet
which
is
a
bonus
id
be
happy
with
a
little
softer
feel
may
2010
release
flavorwise
this
reminds
me
more
of
a
dubbel
than
a
quad
of
course
the
sneaky
abv
says
otherwise
but
still
a
solid
belgianinfluenced
beer
if
not
quite
on
par
with
their
farmhouse
ale
quite
the
big
beer
and
definitely
not
something
to
knock
back
quickly
this
beer
is
meant
to
be
sipped
and
savored
i
like
it
but
this
is
definitely
a
beer
you
have
to
be
in
the
mood
for
di
like
this
beer
i
also
like
that
i
can
get
a
bomber
of
this
at
my
local
bottle
shop
for
6
99
not
a
steal
but
good
buy
for
a
solid
quad
notes
belgian
strong
dark
ales
and
quadrupels
are
two
of
my
favorite
styles
and
this
one
did
not
disappoint
my
pour
created
a
finger
of
deeptan
head
with
decent
retention
the
nose
had
a
yeasty
musty
odor
with
an
underlying
sweetness
color
was
a
beautiful
rubyred
with
nequality
clarity
mouthfeel
was
thick
and
creamy
with
a
really
sugary
taste
on
the
tongue
along
with
fruity
esters
of
apples
grapes
and
bananas
finish
had
a
flavor
and
mouthfeel
like
cocoa
powder
my
housemate
really
dug
it
but
i
found
it
to
be
a
bit
sweet
overall
this
isnt
quite
up
there
with
the
big
boys
as
far
as
the
style
goes
but
its
a
solid
take
worth
a
shot
overall
a
pretty
decent
quad
good
price
on
the
bomber
lots
of
solid
traits
coming
from
this
one
why
a
bomber
though
split
it
and
youll
be
fine
but
a
bomber
solo
on
this
one
is
way
too
much
gravitiation
is
its
name
perhaps
gravity
really
was
at
work
here
and
what
went
up
smuttynose
big
beer
series
eventually
fell
back
down
at
any
rate
i
expect
a
bit
more
from
these
guys
and
just
didnt
see
it
here
a
bit
less
focus
on
the
raisins
and
a
bit
lower
abv
would
make
this
much
more
tolerable
it
comes
off
like
a
homebrewers
poor
attempt
at
a
trappist
10
or
12
pours
a
dark
brown
with
very
little
head
smell
of
raisins
and
dried
fruit
is
very
strong
with
some
of
the
belgian
yeast
coming
through
flavour
has
lots
of
raisin
and
cherry
with
maybe
a
hint
of
chocolate
carbonation
seemed
to
be
a
little
bit
weak
for
the
style
not
one
of
my
favourite
quads
but
still
a
really
nice
beer
thin
and
very
temporary
layer
of
brown
foam
across
the
surface
ends
up
with
an
aggregation
of
large
bubbles
huddled
against
the
glass
sides
zero
lacing
amberish
orange
with
as
much
brown
to
it
as
red
mild
gauziness
the
rims
turn
a
glowing
yellow
the
nose
is
the
joining
of
two
opposite
poles
on
one
side
banana
molasses
butterscotch
caramel
and
fig
golden
raisin
red
apple
peach
red
cherry
fruit
scents
then
peat
moss
black

dried

and
bitter
coffee
grounds
not
much
lift
into
your
nostrils
but
does
have
good
length
medium
and
close
to
fullbodied
has
the
sweetness
and
and
clingy
qualities
just
not
the
ability
to
sink
deeply
into
your
mouth
pores
molasses
brown
sugar
caramel
milk
chocolate
distinct
without
getting
too
sweet
lemon
and
orange

and
apricot
peach
golden

and
date
flavors
likewise
full
yet
not
sugary
ginger
cumin
spices
tar
forest
underbrush
dry
things
out
more
one
might
suggest
that
the
weak
carbonation
hurts
the
sweetness
doesnt
get
the
sugar
zipping
about
the
thing
is
it
comes
across
as
noncommittal
like
it
wants
to
go
in
a
direction
more
decisively
but
then
relents
nothing
horrible
but
there
needs
to
be
more
flavor
intensity
as
well
as
thrust
through
the
finish
drinkability
moderate
at
best
because
of
the
abv
and
weight
but
i
really
like
the
various
aspects
of
this
beer
and
smuttynoses
interpretation
of
the
style
kudos
to
them
poor
icharus
this
beer
pours
a
foggy
bloodamber
topped
by
well
theres
not
really
a
head
here
more
a
mere
rump
congregation
of
disparate
bubbles
and
things
begin
not
with
a
bang
but
a
whimper
the
nose
comprises
raisins
figs
nutmeg
rye
bread
and
a
pinch
of
brown
sugar
if
these
smells
were
more
pronounced
things
would
be
better
but
at
least
were
moving
in
the
right
direction
now
these
elements
are
all
there
on
the
tongue
as
well
joined
by
a
healthy
booziness
and
some
light
cranberries
its
like
biting
into
a
slighty
toasted
fig
newton
thats
been
dipped
in
some
schnapps
its
good
but
not
all
that
much
in
the
grand
scheme
of
quads
the
body
is
a
very
heavy
medium
bordering
on
a
light
heavy
with
a
light
carbonation
and
a
fairly
chewy
feel
overall
a
decent
quad
but
not
very
high
above
average
at
all
a
disappointment
to
be
sure
d
not
what
i
was
expecting
not
an
ideal
but
rather
mediocre
quad
however
i
find
it
rather
enjoyable
as
i
sit
here
after
a
long
day
at
work
i
was
definitely
let
down
by
this
beer
i
am
not
sure
how
it
would
age
but
the
alcohol
burn
of
this
beer
was
just
too
much
to
take
i
love
other
smuttynose
offerings
especially
the
ipa
but
this
did
not
work
for
me
at
first
i
enjoyed
it
but
then
the
harsh
alcohol
burn
took
control
of
the
beer
and
ruined
it
for
me
i
am
not
sure
if
this
is
a
bad
batch
or
what
but
i
wont
be
seeking
this
beer
out
again
7
5
weeks
until
belgium
and
hopefully
a
crate
of
westys
good
enough
beer
but
there
are
a
lot
of
quads
id
reach
for
first
plenty
of
smutty
brews
too
notes
super
boozey
much
better
than
2009
miles
better
but
still
not
a
great
beer
no
sense
of
balance
and
a
little
onenotey
with
the
bananaclove
bit
from
the
big
beer
series
2010
batch
sampled
on
july
3
2010
the
color
of
the
pour
is
mainly
amber
brown
but
if
you
hold
it
to
the
light
you
get
a
purplish
hue
which
i
found
to
be
fascinating
the
head
is
about
a
halfinch
thick
silky
and
beige
it
does
not
last
long
the
aroma
has
a
bit
of
yeast
breads
and
thin
malts
i
was
a
little
disappointed
that
i
did
not
get
the
fruitiness
that
is
so
often
associated
with
belgian
style
ales
the
mouthfeel
is
heavy
and
oily
the
taste
tends
to
lean
bitter
with
a
faint
yeasty
background
but
the
alcohol
zips
into
my
sinuses
and
burns
its
way
down
my
throat
i
can
feel
it
move
downward
in
there
it
is
easy
to
drink
but
given
its
higher
abv
it
is
also
easy
to
lighten
your
head
by
ill
keep
it
short
and
sweet
because
i
didnt
write
down
a
full
review
at
all
smelled
and
tasted
of
fruit
punch
that
had
been
spiked
at
a
high
school
prom
highly
medicinal
tart
dark
fruit
boozy
and
not
very
enjoyable
missing
the
excellent
balance
and
complexities
of
the
belgian
quads
mouthfeel
is
way
too
thin
for
the
style
as
well
the
price
is
low
at
least
smuttynose
is
usually
stellar
and
i
know
quad
must
be
a
tough
style
to
brew
i
did
have
this
right
after
speedway
stout
i
would
give
it
another
shot
d
the
appearance
and
nose
were
a
little
off
for
me
but
the
taste
was
really
impressive
very
well
balanced
and
enjoyable
mouthfeel
is
fine
but
feels
a
bit
thin
and
flat
compared
to
some
of
my
other
favorite
quads
drinkability
is
a
real
big
issue
here
as
even
having
a
full
pint
is
a
real
struggle
with
the
alcohol
dominating
pours
a
deep
brown
with
ruby
highlights
and
a
thin
tan
head
that
retains
as
well
as
you
could
expect
from
a
12
beer
the
aroma
kicks
it
up
a
notch
with
big
dark
fruits
upfront
notes
of
blackberry
cherry
grape
and
plum
along
with
cane
and
candy
sugar
toasted
bread
funky
esters
a
little
white
peppercorn
and
a
little
alcohol
the
flavor
starts
out
with
dark
fruits
as
well
with
notes
of
strawberry
jam
raspberry
grape
and
blueberry
along
with
a
massive
sugary
sweetness
along
with
some
funky
esters
honey
wheat
bread
and
a
big
alcohol
wallop
the
mouthfeel
is
velvety
and
drinkability
is
bordering
on
bad
this
is
a

this

more
prominent
the
more
i
drink
i
do
not
see
this
getting
better
with
age
it
is
already
too
sweet
i
think
smutty
needs
to
axe
this
one
and
get
a
better
style
to
fit
in
the
rotation
of
the

not

the

the

with

taste
and
a

the
mouthfeel
is
average
its
not
terribly
heavy
slightly
syrupy
but
not
overly
so
the
drinkability
is
average
it
certainly
does
not
encourage
quick
drinking
overall
i
like
this
beer
although
it
might
be
a
little
too
much
definitely
interesting
and
worth
trying
i
havent
had
many
quads
before
so
i
dont
really
have
anything
to
compare
it
to
but
i
like
it

held

though
as
i
found
it

decent

and
if
i
was
to
have
this
as
a

i
could

glad
that
i

a

in

it
would
be

the

maybe

ways

but
i
am
going
to
finish
it
mouthfeel
is
rich
and
complex
drinkability
is
ok
for
such
a
strong
and
sweet
tasting
beer
i
split
the
bomber
and
that
was
just
enough
for
one
session
i
felt
the
booziness
almost
immediately
it
was
a
good
quad
i
recommend
it
in
summary
a
quad
should
have
a
lot
of
malt
but
the
key
is
to
balance
that
power
with
flavor
and
complexity
aside
from
tasting
like
prune
juice
this
beer
is
not
complex
while
i
appreciate
the
extreme
take
on
a
beer
and
the
daring
attempt
to
make
raisens
cool
again
i
just
did
not
like
it
at
all
it
reminds
me
of
my
friend
who
tried
to
homebrew
with
berries
and
he
did
not
cut
back
on
the
malt
it
just
tasted
defective
dthis
is
quite
enjoyable
borders
on
being
a
little
too
sweet
but
i
like
it
d
if
youre
into
grapes
and
raisins
this
is
the
brew
for
you
i
see
the
description
says
this
is
made
with
200lbs
of
raisin
and
it
sure
resembles
that
tastes
like
a
fruit
mash
not
enjoyable
i
couldnt
finish
this
smuttynose
hasnt
impressed
me
i
think
ill
stay

this

a
quality
beer
from
one
of
my
favorite
new
england
breweries
md
very
sticky
mouth
feel
after
each
sip
welcomes
the
next
one
the
only
downside
is
that
it
is
so
filling
it
is
hard
to
finish
this
poured
a
hazy
dark
mahogany
with
tan
head
it
smelled
like
dry
earthy
chocolate
malt
and
sour
but
creamy
yeast
with
some
fig
and
whole
wheat
and
a
bit
of
alcohol
it
tasted
like
sweet
raisins
and
honey
wheat
with
some
creamy
yeast
and
a
bit
of
salty
and
sour
lemons
it
was
somewhat
thick
with
moderate
carbonation
and
had
a
tangy
aftertaste
overall
this
seemed
like
a
blend
of
a
dubbel
with
an
old
ale
but
not
really
a
quad
it
had
good
flavor
but
wasnt
quite
fitting
for
the
style
it
had
good
body
too
but
it
didnt
have
the
silky
refinement
of
most
true
belgian
quads
it
didnt
have
too
much
complexity
either
although
the
alcohol
was
hidden
decently
so
it
was
fairly
easy
to
drink
this
was
an
interesting
beer
and
enjoyable
but
it
cant
compete
with
the
better
quads
d
this
is
a
very
nice
beer
they
do
a
good
job
of
capturing
the
belgian
aspect
of
the
style
not
as
complex
as
some
no
hint
of
the
alcohol
could
be
dangerous
i
dont
think
i
would
reach
for
a
second
one
but
i
would
happily
buy
this
again
next
year
recommended
the
beer
was
dark
red
in
color
and
looked
good
despite
a
head
smaller
than
typical
for
the
style
the
smell
was
a
mix
of
dark
skinned
fruits
and
spices
but
was
not
as
strong
as
most
other
beers
of
this
style
the
taste
was
much
simpler
than
i
like
as
the
fruit
juice
like
sweetness
was
dominant
over
other
tastes
there
wasnt
much
spiciness
or
bitterness
present
to
counterbalance
the
pleasing
but
one
dimensional
flavor
the
beer
also
felt
oddly
thin
in
the
mouth
id
say
that
this
is
a
couple
steps
behind
the
other
smuttynose
big
beers
ive
sampled
thus
far
good
stuff
but
not
amazing
i
think
very
much
unfairly
that
my
view
of
this
beer
is
affected
by
my
having
had
boulevard
bbq
recently
yes
different
variations
of
the
style
but
bbq
was
much
more
complex
subtle
less
sweet
and
more
drinkable
still
check
this
beer
out
d
pretty
nice
to
sip
on
although
a
touch
too
sweet
for
my
taste
it
could
use
a
spicier
character
in
my
opinion
this
reminds
me
a
lot
of
dogfish
heads
raison
detre
although
gravitation
is
more
focused
and
complex
an
interesting
changeofpace
beer
but
too
sweet
for
regular
consumption
overall
i
thought
this
was
outstanding
easily
one
of
the
smoothest
and
most
drinkable
i
have
run
across
in
the
style
i
guess
when
taken
into
context
it
is
a
bit
off
from
some
of
the
big
quads
out
there
but
i
really
feel
that
this
was
very
very
well
done
the
taste
is
really
really
smooth
this
is
a
full
bodied
sipping
beer
that
is
sessionable
but
i
dont
think
i
would
venture
in
that
direction
the
taste
is
full
of
raisins
liqueur
sweetness
maybe
some
brandy
flavors
maybe
a
touch
of
fennel
this
is
a
complex
enough
beer
with
a
mouthfeel
that
is
quite
light
there
isnt
much
aftertaste
and
only
the
slightest
throatiness
on
the
very
back
end
this
one
is
quite
good

a

kinda
harsh
on

you
adjust
to
it

d
its
got
just
the

sparkle
and
a

of
a

feel
a

bodied

not
really
big

rich
its
a
decent
sipper
but
it
continues
to
be
quite
sweet
and
doesnt
really
mellow
as
it
warms
or
anything
so
its
a
slow
goer
not
a
bad
beer
overall
but
something
doesnt
seem
quite
right
very
good
beer
not
as
good
as
many
quads
but
a
good
drinking
beer
none
the
less
edit
and
on
reading
other
reviews
no
im
a
bit
surprised
i
mean
its
like
they
werent
drinking
the
same
beer
i
was
whats
up
with
that
pours
a
nice
dark
amber

color
with
a
small
thats
gone

is

i
enjoyed
this
bomber
to
myself
and
drank
the
whole
the
thing
over
the
course
of
an
hour
or
two
and
loved
every
drop
nice
quad
from
an
impressive
east
coast
brewery
thanks
again
keith
but
the
alchohol
doesnt
intrude
its
just
peeping
thru
overall
a
little
to
sweet
for
me
never
a
big
fan
of
raisins
so
i
think
thats
what
puts
me
off
this
one
a
little
d
im
enjoying
this
beer
as
it
satisfies
the
desire
to
find
something
different
in
a
craft
beer
it
has
a
unique
flavor
and
its
not
overpowering
the
alcohol
is
there
but
there
is
no
burn
or
bite
d
pretty
easy
drinking
given
the
alcohol
content
i
think
i
actually
like
this
one
better
than
dogfish
rasion
detre
the
nose
is
too
sweet
its
got
fruit
raisins
figs
dark
fruit
in
general
syrup
malt
yeast
and

the
appearance
is
deep
amber
with
a
nice
head
the
flavor
is
like
the
aroma
the
palate
is
a
tad
thin
but
ok
overall
its
a
very
decent
beer
but
cloyingly
sweet
d
i
cant
drink
this
bottle
poured
a
deep
copper
color
ale
with
a
huge
light
brown
foamy
head
with
good
retention
and
good
lacing
aroma
of
dry
fruit
figs
and
raisins
with
some
rum
notes
and
some
candi
sugar
taste
is
a
well
balance
mix
between
some
candi
sugar
some
dry
fruits
and
some
rum
notes
with
a
great
malt
backbone
body
is
little
bit
hint
for
the
style
with
good
carbonation
and
no
hints
of
alcohol
very
well
done
but
i
thought
the
candu
sugar
was
a
little
bit
too
upfront
and
some
additional
body
would
have
brought
this
to
classic
level
d
im
enjoying
this
beer
quite
a
bit
the
alcohol
is
definitely
there
in
the
taste
but
the
beer
is
surprisingly
smooth
gravitation
is
a
beer
that
i
would
definitely
purchase
again
recommended
no
matter
what
you
think
going
into
the
beer
clear
out
an
hour
its
a
sipper
poured
into
an
imperial
pint

formed

over
the
clear

head

aroma
is

fruity
heavy
on
the
booze
taste
follows
the
nose
with
the
alcohol
close
a
bit
harsh
mouthfeel
is
a
little
rough
and
drinkability
is
limited
by
all
of
the
above
this
ones
harsher
than
i
would
have
expected
from
smutty
made
me
think
of
the
beast
seems
way
stronger
than
8
5abv
your
mileage
may
vary
the
mouthfeel
is
excellent
this
is
an
after
dinner
sipping
beer
to
pair
with
a
fine
cigar
like
i
said
before
this
is
a
belgian
barleywine
i
could
sip
on
this
for
quite
a
while
pours
a
ruby
brown
color
with
an
average
khaki
colored
head
that
settles
into
a
light
head
the
aroma
is
pretty
nonexistant
for
a
quad
not
much
aroma
at
all
the
taste
is
of
grape
juice
kind
of
sugary
but
not
really
i
dunno
does
not
have
the
complexity
of
a
good
quad
not
even
close
the
body
is
thin
no
real
dark
fruit
flavors
or
malt
complexity
it
doesnt
taste
bad
not
at
all
but
just
doesnt
taste
like
a
quad
or
belgian
brew
not
sure
if
a
belgian
yeast
strain
was
used
or
any
candi
sugar
moderate
feel
with
fizzy
carbonation
finishes
sweet
if
you
are
looking
for
a
sweet
old
ale
with
fizzy
carbonation
this
might
be
for
you
doesnt
really
remind
me
of
a
belgian
beer
at
all
just
a
sweet
beer
i
guess
this
is
the
first
big
beer
serier
beer
that
i
am
disappointed
in
though
again
it
doesnt
taste
bad
d
ill
be
lucky
to
finish
off
the
bomber
the
sweetness
coupled
with
the
booze
is
almost
too
much

tried
some
southampton
abbot
12
this
afternoon
did
not
bode
well
for
this
selection
another
sip
confirms
my
feelings
too
sweet
for
my
liking
doubt
i
would
give
this
one
another
try
drinkability
whaddya
know
thats
pretty
good
a
lovely
sweet
fruity
beer
from
the
fine
folks
over
at
smuttynose
as
to
drinkability
its
certainly
impressive
its
readily
accessible
if
a
little
bit
sweet
at
first
but
then
again
it
is
a
kind
of
a
sipper
as
well
and
that
sweetness
is
balanced
the
strength
is
present
but
not
overwhelming
and
its
rich
enough
and
complex
enough
to
keep
you
coming
back
to
it
time
and
time
again
they
could
have
easily
gone
overboard
with
this
one
but
instead
they
kept
everything
reigned
in
and
focused
and
that
seems
to
be
something
thats
kind
of
outthedoor
with
u
s
brewers
these
days
superb
still
all
things
considered
this
is
a
pretty
tasty
beer
from
smuttynose
not
bad
at
all
notes
it
is
not
as
big
as
my
first
impression
of
it
was
but
its
decently
drinkable
cheers
d
thick
heavy
somewhat
syrupy
and
with
a
flavor
that
isnt
entirely
appealing
enough
to
make
me
desire
an
entire
22oz
although
im
enjoying
it
im
glad
im
splitting
this
with
my
wife
d
ok
a
very
mild
brew
it
goes
down
easy
but
definitely
a
disappointment
for
a
quad
this
is
like
an
overly
sweetened
dubbel
mouthfeel
is
a
bit
slick
for
my
liking
i
prefer
my
quads
to
be
a
bit
more
carbonated
but
overall
a
good
drinking
beer
and
another
great
offering
from
smuttynose
so
glad
that
theyve
finally
made
it
to
florida
pours
with
a
brownish
red
color
and
a
fairly
insignificant
head
some
caramel
and
spice
notes
come
through
on
the
aromas
it
weighs
heavy
in
the
mouth
with
classic
belgian
flavors
and
a
hint
of
coriander
but
goes
down
clean
and
smooth
a
great
find
now
i
gotta
go
find
some
more
drinkability
very
good
an
excellent
sippin
beer
while
its
on
the
sweet
side
and
not
overall
balanced
it
still
is
very
appealing
interesting
mouth
feel
taste
is
very
creamy
and
slick
very
very
slick
and
buttery
good
maltiness
with
a
strong
banana
presence
strong
carbonation
prickles
the
mouth
in
a
good
way
pretty
sweet
and
candied
a
pretty
beer
in
a
goblet
reddishbrown
color
with
a
modest
size
white
head
an
aroma
of
raisin
bread
fruity
and
a
whiff
of
alcohol
a
taste
of
dark
fruit
and
bready
making
it
a
fairly
chewy
beer
a
little
too
much
on
the
sweet
side
but
still
a
nice
beer
notes
the
drinkability
take
a
little
hit
because
theres
an
aspect
of
the
sweetness
i
dont
really
care
for
and
for
the
thickness
of
the
brew
i
can
see
mixed
opinions
here
so
i
would
recommend
splitting
with
a
friend
before
going
it
alone
also
aging
might
take
some
of
the
raw
heat
off
which
would
probably
be
helpful

thanks
matt
taste
whoa
whats
with
all
the
residual
sugar
this
is
the
sweetest
quad
ive
had
and
thats
not
a
good
thing
the
overpowering
sweetness
overshadows
whatever
complexities
reside
in
this
beer
there
may
be
a
lot
there
but
i
just
cant
get
past
the
sweetness
and
cant
finish
the
bomber
it
might
not
take
more
than
a
few
tweaks
to
make
this
good
and
i
hope
the
folks
at
smuttynose
rethink
this

a
very
good

tasty

complex
and
drinkable
for
the
style
another
slamdunk
from
smuttynose
d
not
the
most
drinkable
i
had
around
7
ounces
and
by
the
end
it
was
just
too
much
sweetness
d
very
tasty
goes
down
quite
easily
not
too
filling
good
kick
very
good
representation
of
style
this
is
an
excellent
strong
and
flavorful
belgian
beer
to
drink
for
a
whole
evening
and
yet
another
great
beer
in
the
smuttynose
big
beer
series
very
sweet
low
on
the
bitterness
a
very
drinkable
quad
definitely
an
american
version
though
not
as
strong
the
amount
of
malts
are
just
as
high
this
one
could
probably
be
enjoyed
from
a
pint
glass
recommended
drinkability
not
bad
beer
worth
a
try
didnt
wow
me
in
any
way
d
very
forward
overt
sweetness
keeps
this
beer
from
ever
developing
the
subtleties
that
make
a
superb
quad
into
a
work
of
art
never
really
breaks
out
of
average
in
any
aspect
would
have
fared
just
about
as
well
as
the
other
american
quads
did
in
the
tasting
i
had
feel
could
be
a
bit
thicker
but
not
too
off
base
carbonation
keeps
the
sweetness
at
bay
drinkability
is
very
good
not
sure
if
i
would
want
another
in
one
night
but
im
enjoying
the
hell
out
of
this
one
had
this
at
track
84
served
in
a
tulip
4
pour
appearance
was
similar
to
grape
cola
with
a
quarter
inch
offwhite
head
that
dissipated
into
a
thin
fairly
consistent
slick
nose
was
dark
fruit
fairly
subdued
taste
revealed
dark
fruit
and
cocoa
mouthfeel
was
mediumbodied
and
very
effervescent
which
placed
it
a
little
offstyle
in
my
opinion
this
is
a
very
flavorful
quad
perhaps
lacking
in
some
of
the
complexity
associated
with
the
style
but
i
applaud
smuttynose
for
the
fact
that
they
consistently
put
out
great
offerings
well
worth
your
time
this
is
quite
easy
to
drink
for
the
style
and
an
excellent
beer
for
the
value
smooth
delicious
and
dangerously
drinkable
d
good
but
big
a
little
sweet
so
i
guess
this
is
what
200lbs
of
raisins
tastes
like
i
guess
i
can
see
that
in
hindsight
i
wish
the
sun
maid
girl
was
here
to
help
me
finish
it
shes
kinda
cute
not
a
typical
quad
call
it
a
desert
beer
or
digestif
sweet
drinkability
good
however
one
is
more
then
enough
not
bad
at
all
but
not
nearly
my
favorite
quad
it
doesnt
fit
the
style
all
that
well
its
a
toasty
malt
beast
a
bomb
of
grain
sugar
with
a
glycemic
index
that
stares
down
and
cows
the
most
potent
insulin
this
is
what
happens
when
you
deregulate
maltose
and
dried
fruit
and
yet
the
abv
manages
to
shine
through
as
well
so
it
could
be
better
and
it
could
be
worse
and
im
hoping
for
more
from
smutty
next
time
if
only
for
more
complexity
and
dimension
in
a
big
beer
pours
a
deep
dark
brown
color
with
a
thin
tan
head
that
stays
until
the
end
and
laces
nicely
smells
really
sweet
sugary
like
candy
and
caramel
flavors
tastes
of
lots
of
sweet
malts
smooth
alcohol
flavors
and
great
belgian
spices
that
dont
stand
out
to
much
to
bite
your
tongue
just
a
great
combination
and
blend
of
flavors
it
goes
down
so
well
and
drinks
unbelievable
moderate
carbonation
even
mouthfeel
fairly
full
fairly
drinkable
but
very
rich
the
beer
pours
a
clear
brown
color
with
some
light
brown
foam
but
not
a
large
head
the
smell
was
malty
with
a
light
sweetness
and
a
touch
of
something
fruitysweet
or
herbal
the
flavor
was
malty
but
it
had
a
strong
offputting
flavor
that
i
could
not
put
my
finger
on
i
thought
it
might
be
from
their
yeast
since
i
recall
this
same
flavor
in
the
winter
ale
dubbel
but
it
was
not
as
pronounced
or
unpleasant
there
someone
told
me
that
it
is
from
raisins
that
are
used
in
the
recipe
the
mouthfeel
was
good
smooth
creamy
mediumfull
body
the
strange
flavor
takes
points
off
the
drinkability
picked
up
a
couple
of
these
to
check
out
the
latest
from
one
of
my
favorite
breweries
unfortunately
what
poured
as
a
nice
looking
mahogany
brew
turned
into
a
brow
sugar
overly
sweet
experience
ill
try
again
next
year
if
they
bring
this
back
but
im
all
set
for
this
year
big
hopes
for
cellarabilty
though
overall
a
very
underwhelming
quad
and
by
no
means
one
of
my
favorite
smuttynose
offerings
drinkability
nice
for
the
style
but
the
one
bomber
bottle
is
enough
for
a
session
better
to
share
this
one
with
a
friend
great
flavor
try
this
one
this
wont
replace
any
real
belgian
quads
a
disappointment
from
one
of
my
favorite
brewers
overall
not
too
bad
though
its
certainly
not
holding
a
candle
to
any
actual
belgian
quad
as
others
have
stated
i
do
find
it
a
bit
too
sweet
for
my
liking
perhaps
it
will
settle
down
with
age
pretty
good
drinkability
overall
a
decent
beer
that
i
could
see
being
better
in
about
6
months
the
nose
is
vinious
and
mildy
sugary
as
is
the
taste
not
syrupy
sweet
not
cloying
a
nice
balance
between
candy
sugar
and
sweet
friut
like
strawberries
the
alcohol
is
well
hidden
this
is
an
enjoyable
brew
thats
reasonably
priced
ffor
a
quad
cinnamon
taste
as
it
warms
this
beer
is
big
on
sweet
and
big
on
fruity
flavors
tastes
of
plum
raisin
and
some
sort
of
tropical
flavor
almost
like
the
strawberrykiwi
juice
blends
you
can
buy
in
the
store
just
a
hint
of
hop
kick
at
the
end
helps
ground
the
flavor
so
that
the
sweetness
doesnt
become
unbearable
the
big
malt
presence
just
lingers
in
the
throat
and
on
the
tongue
after
but
the
fairly
high
carbonation
keeps
it
feeling
fresh
its
actually
a
pretty
light
body
for
the
style
much
lighter
than
im
used
to
its
not
the
highest
in
alcohol
for
a
beer
like
this
but
still
what
it
carries
is
almost
undetectable
this
is
a
dangerously
drinkable
beer
and
another
solid
offering
from
smutty
to
me
it
doesnt
really
go
beyond
solid
its
good
but
not
great
it
just
lacks
those
extra
layers
of
complexity
a
great
quad
should
bear
for
a
quadlite
it
is
a
great
introduction
to
the
style
a
very
solid
smutty
offering
not
many
flaws
however
nothing
flavorwise
that
would
assert
this
as
a
staple
of
the
style
in
comparison
to
my
favorite
quadrupel
scaldis
noel
unfortunately
gravitation
doesnt
come
close
1108
reasonably
priced
but
quite
underwhelming
i
dont
see
this
getting
much
better
with
age
but
who
knows
poured
into
a
chimay
glass
i
like
the
color
a
nice
amberbrown
the
head
disappeared
a
bit
too
quickly
the
taste
was
sweet
and
raisiney
with
the
hops
comming
in
just
after
still
very
balanced
this
is
one
of
my
favorites
of
recent
not
a
session
beer
but
i
could
have
two
22oz
bottles
in
a
row
a
really
nice
smuttynose
offering
pours
a
clear
deep
red
with
a
bubbly
creamy
off
white
head
that
sticks
around
for
a
while
smells
of
dark
fruits
molasses
very
sweet
and
malty
a
bit
of
yeast
character
pokes
its
head
out
as
this
one
warms
taste
is
sweet
and
fruity
with
an
alcohol
bite
with
some
phenols
mixed
in
there
a
bit
of
spicy
belgian
yeast
with
a
dry
finish
that
leaves
sweet
and
phenols
on
the
palette
body
is
thick
mouthfeel
is
creamysyrupy
carbonation
is
medium
to
high
decent
quad
but
a
bit
high
on
the
alcohol
and
phenols
for
me
maybe
a
bit
of
age
would
help
this
one
see
you
again
in
a
year
gravitation
mouthfeel
was
thick
and
syrupy
and
not
in
a
good
way
rather
than
the
smooth
rich
complex
sweetness
of
the
best
quads
this
was
more
akin
to
a
fountain
coke
that
hadnt
been
properly
watered
down
im
a
bit
dissapointed
in
this
quad
and
thats
only
because
its
a
style
that
has
soo
many
amazing
versions
usually
ultracomplex
but
only
a
few
american
quads
even
come
close
to
the
real
deal
quads
of
belgium
picked
up
a
bomber
at
abes
cold
beer
for
7
50
this
is
a
uniquely
american
quad
its
a
world
away
from
st
bernardus
or
westvletern
but
somewhat
similar
to
averys
the
reverend
like
the
smuttynose
saison
theres
a
thick
powerful
kick
of
phenols
that
borders
on
medicinal
but
is
largely
clove
the
fruit
flavor
are
interesting
with
a
mix
of
strawberry
juice
dates
and
blackberries
once
the
punch
subsided
a
clean
dry
cocoa
flavor
kicks
in
thats
unusal
but
not
unwelcome
good
points
for
drinkability
too
worth
a
try
if
youre
an
openminded
drinker
mouthcoating
goodness
here
nice
for
a
cold
day
and
not
overpowering
enough
to
make
this
hard
to
drink
one
bigassed
bomber
was
enough
not
like
anyone
is
going
to
keep
hitting
this
nor
should
they
prior
to
this
i
was
a
quad
virgin
so
i
need
to
compare
to
another
to
get
a
real
feel
for
this
brew
and
style
that
said
this
a
a
real
openminded
review
worth
a
try
good
for
a
sipper
on
a
cold
winter
day
indoors
nightcap
material
through
and
through
smutty
really
hasnt
disappointed
me
yet
keep
up
the
great
work
very
smooth
and
easy
drinking
excellent
quad
from
smutty
a
really
sweet
offering
that
i
had
some
troubles
with
up
front
but
my
tastebuds
adjusted
and
i
was
able
to
enjoy
it
more
towards
the
end
overall
it
surprised
me
at
first
grew
on
me
a
bit
but
by
the
end
of
the
22oz
i
was
ready
to
be
finished
not
the
best
quad
ive
ever
had
drinkability
moving
on
to
the
rochefort
10
possibly
spoiled
by
drinking
quality
beers
on
a
regular
basis
overall
this
beer
was
a
little
too
young
when
i
drank
it
id
imagine
that
in
a
month
or
so
the
sweetness
will
mellow
a
little
bit
and
bring
up
my
opinion
even
more
overall
i
wouldnt
turn
it
down
if
it
was
offered
to
me
and
for
the
price
its
pretty
good
but
theres
much
better
stuff
out
there
heres
hoping
smutty
turns
down
the
mash
temp
for
next
years
batch
and
that
this
second
bottle
i
have
will
be
better
by
then
it
is
always
nice
to
see
a
new
big
beer
from
smuttynose
in
new
hampshire
i
love
the
artwork
on
the
label
which
i
am
guessing
is
some
sort
of
tribute
to
miltons
paradise
lost
anyway
back
to
the
beer
pours
a
dark
rosy
color
with
just
a
lacing
worth
of
white
heading
brown
bread
in
the
nose
followed
by
some
sweet
dark
fruit
creamy
almost
reminds
me
of
a
dessert
wine
in
some
ways
taste
starts
off
with
a
punch
of
chocolate
then
some
fruity
flavors
and
ending
on
a
malted
milk
ball
quality
not
unlike
whoppers
body
is
thick
syrupy
and
boozy
sweetness
can
become
a
bit
much
at
times
making
it
a
tough
one
to
finish
on
your
own
this
was
an
ok
beer
from
smuttynose
but
i
dont
feel
that
it
resembles
a
quad
my
first
thought
after
sipping
it
was
that
it
had
a
strong
bock
character
to
it
i
am
not
one
to
quibble
over
style
but
it
does
say
on
the
label
that
this
is
a
belgian
style
quadrupel
anyway
not
bad
at
all
just
not
something
i
will
be
going
back
to
any
time
soon
cheers
not
particularly
recommended
smuttynoses
website
lists
this
beer
as
8
5
i
just
finished
the
bottle
and
im
not
nearly
as
intoxicated
as
i
would
be
after
drinking
other
quads
absolutely
a
plus
as
the
flavor
clearly
hasnt
suffered
a
dark
ruby
almost
opaque
brown
pour
with
little
head
or
lacing
smell
consists
of
cherries
which
is
also
te
dominant
flavor
found
in
the
taste
i
would
like
to
taste
more
of
the
belgian
style
yeast
in
the
beer
as
the
tartness
of
the
cherries
overtakes
it
excellent
drinkability
and
overall
another
great
big
beer
from
smuttynose
all
in
all
a
good
interpretation
of
a
quad
by
a
great
brewery
seems
almost
like
a
belgians
interpretation
of
a
double
bock
a
little
to
sweet
to
drink
a
bomber
alone
but
a
good
beer
overall
one
of
the
most
exciting
takes
on
one
of
my
favorite
beer
styles
this
seems
to
be
a
hybrid
dry
stoutquad
tasty
and
works
well
with
a
early
afternoon
of
people
watching
and
light
conversation
this
was
a
great
beer
a
friend
brought
it
over
and
i
was
skeptical
it
turned
out
to
be
a
very
tasty
belgium
beer
sampled
at
a
recent
bottle
share
i
hosted
as
far
as
quads
go
id
put
this
one
in
the
bottom
half
just
didnt
do
it
for
me
from
the
22
oz
bomber
into
a
cervoise
this
one
is
a
clear
dark
rubychestnut
color
with
lots
of
bubbly
precipitation
fuelling
a
solid
off
white
head
which
is
initially
about
12
fingers
slowly
fading
to
a
thick
collar
and
spotty
cap
with
nice
lacing
nose
of
sweet
dark
fruits
and
sweet
malt
mouth
is
semichewy
and
quite
bubbly
for
style
flavors
of
big
fruits
up
front
hints
of
sweet
slightly
smokey
malt
a
bit
of
alcohol
burn
on
the
back
finishes
on
a
bitter
fairly
strong
hops
note
feels
very
americanquadish
and
not
nearly
as
subtle
as
belgian
quads
and
other
similar
styles
not
bad
at
all
but
nowhere
near
the
level
of
the
best
in
style
no
doubt
would
benefit
from
cellaring
sweet
improved
with
correct
temperature
55
degrees
f
o
4

one
of
the
better
quads
ive
drank
in
a
long
time
its
no
trappistes
rochefort
10
or
a
not
the
stoic
but
its
one
of
the
best
ive
had
in
some
time
once
again
i
cant
believe
how
well
balanced
this
beer
is
definitely
suggested
and
recommended
to
fans
of
the
style
o
very
dominant
with
the
triticale
it
is
a
good
beer
if
you
like
triticale
i
think
they
could
have
done
much
better
and
this
would
be
absolutely
ridiculous
if
it
were
barrel
aged
4
0
d
very
good
beer
no
real
faults
and
the
triticale
brings
a
new
flavor
into
the
mix
the
aroma
has
a
pleasing
note
of
stone
fruit
some
raisin
and
orange
peel
the
flavor
has
a
delicate
raisin
and
candied
orange
with
a
rounded
sweetness
without
being
too
heavy
or
sweet
this
is
really
good
so
smooth
so
tasty
everything
a
beer
is
supposed
to
be
cozy
winter
treat
taste
follows
nose
much
more
wheaty
than
a
traditional
belgian
but
very
good
overall
an
ok
quad
but
nothing
extraordinary
glad
it
wasnt
sweeter
c
o
one
of
the
best
american
quads
ive
had
great
flavors
a
killer
nose
and
solid
complexity
makes
me
wish
this
beer
was
a
rotational
thing
instead
of
a
one
time
only
release
personal
notes
reminiscent
of
my
early
attempts
at
home
brewing
belgian
ales
both
in
flavor
and
smell
powerful
alcohol
punch
not
too
tasty
22
ounce
bottle
bottled
on
060214
served
in
a
dfh
signature
glass
the
beer
pours
a
slightly
hazy
reddishbrown
color
with
about
a
half
inch
tan
head
that
didnt
stay
around
for
very
long
theres
a
decent
amount
of
lacing
the
brew
smells
like
dark
fruit
raisins
plums
figs
brown
sugar
sweet
spices
cloves
and
some
dark
bread
i
think
the
taste
pretty
much
follows
the
aroma
but
theres
also
some
apple
and
a
weird
herbal
bitter
kinda
like
a
ricola
cough
drop
finish
noticeable
that
bitterness
bugged
me
at
first
but
luckily
it
didnt
bother
me
for
long
guess
i
just
got
used
to
it
mouthfeelbody
is
medium
its
a
bit
slick
with
a
moderate
amount
of
carbonation
overall
i
liked
this
brew
definitely
worth
trying

a

delightful
smooth
rich

but
not
too
sweet
one
of
the
best
belgium
quads
ive
had
well
balanced
amazingly
smooth
for
9

i
think
the
best
feature
of
this
is
the
restrained
sugar
for
such
a
rich
brew
the
flavor
is
just
plain
weird
though
slight
bitter
finish
from
the
22
oz
bottle
purchased
at
litickers
liquor
in
ocean
beach
moderately
priced

best
feature
imho
so
its
worth
a
try
if
you
like
a
strong
and
strange
brew
good
looking
and
smelling
beer
the
taste
was
a
little
off
from
what
i
had
hoped
for
not
sure
i
would
have
two
of
these
in
a
row
but
i
would
do
it
again

overall
a

a

a

not

worth
the

tag
in
comparison
to
other
more
renowned
quads
dark
amber
color
with
a
quarter
inch
head
that
dissipated
within
a
minute
to
a
very
light
film
aroma
was
very
faint
with
just
some
light
caramel
notes
and
just
a
hint
of
dark
fruit
taste
was
lots
of
dark
fruit
molasses
and
some
spicy
flavors
mouthfeel
was
pretty
thin
for
a
quad
overall
this
one
was
a
bit
disappointing
usually
stones
offerings
are
a
little
better
all
this
leads
to
an
easier
drinking
quad
aging
this
might
make
it
too
mellow
but
i
may
buy
a
bottle
to
do
that
just
to
see
its
a
nice
quad
to
use
for
introducing
someone
to
the
style
though
it
is
not
really
a
good
representation
of
the
style
highly
drinkable
really
good

minearlity
nice
dark
belgian
to
be
sure
this
was
strong
but
it
went
down
as
easily
as
any
quad
that
ive
ever
had
it
looks
and
pours
like
one
and
has
enough
dates
and
fig
in
it
to
make
one
think
that
this
was
one
the
feel
was
like
a
barleywine
as
i
said
before
and
its
a
testament
to
the
moderate
carbonation
and
subtle
potency
of
this
this
was
greats
stuff
that
was
unlike
any
quad
ive
had
before
and
both
fans
of
belgian
beers
and
stones
offerings
will
love
what
theyve
come
up
with
here
overall
i
loved
it
and
am
looking
up
how
to
get
a
hold
of
some
triticale
myself
to
brew
with
some
of
it
and
some
of
that
yeast
too
dark
brown
color
big
raisiny
dried
fruity
flavors
sweet
fruity
maltiness
with
a
hint
of
alcohol
and
bready
grain
interesting
brew
a
bit
of
cereal
graininess
but
a
serviceable
sipper
overall
interesting
take
on
a
belgian
beer
the
triticale
must
smooth
it
out
the
beer
has
a
peculiar
thin
quality
to
the
mouthfeel
also
the
grain
bill
is
smooth
like
a
wheat
characteristic
balanced
pretty
well
for
a
big
beer
would
probably
buy
again
rich
body
with
lots
of
alcohol
warmth
as
one
would
expect
from
a
quad
no
sweetnessjust
dry
dark
caramel
theres
a
bit
of
hop
bitterness
in
the
swallow
and
aftertaste
this
is
a
perfect
beer
to
balance
spicy
food
low
carbonation
truly
coats
the
tongue
and
throat
overall
a
belgian
quad
that
has
the
elements
in
place
however
i
found
this
brew
was
taken
over
by
the
candied
sugar
some
minor
tweaks
with
this
one
would
sure
let
the
other
ingredients
shine
and
make
it
more
true
to
the
style
bomber
poured
into

the
initial
wave

i
enjoy
reading
the
wordy
tangential
musings
on
these
labels
this
brew
is
on
the
light
side
color
wise
a
bronze
amber
with
a
small
amount
of
frothy
beige
foam
in
top
does
leave
a
nice
thick
lacing
on
the
glass
aroma
is
rich
and
sweet
christmas
puddinglike
with
some
toasted
grains
dark
fruits
brown
sugar
and
cinnamonnutmegginger
all
nicely
melded
together
dangerously
smooth
and
drinkable
comes
across
as
lightmedium
bodied
its
easy
to
forget
that
even
the
biggest
trappistabbey
ales
are
still
supposed
to
err
on
the
side
of
drinkable
to
hear
the
monks
talk
gentle
carbonation
malts
evoke
honeyed
breakfast
cereal
and
a
little
chocolate

poached
pears
cinnamon
nutmeg
and
white
pepper
spice
round
out
the
flavor
profile
rich
sweet
taste
but
does
not
become
cloying
with
more
emphasis
on
malts
and
fruity
hops
than
classic
belgian
spicy
phenols
certainly
a
unique
take
on
the
style
with
west
coast
hop
flourishes
and
a
rounded
sweetness
that
can
be
less
apparent
in
the
true
belgian
examples
bold
like
most
stone
beers
yet
with
a
pleasing
subtle
complexity
an
interesting
breakdown
of
what
a
quadruplestyle
ale
can
and
could
be
beyond
the
more
delineated
bsda
guidelines
pick
yer
grains
and
go
to

son
way
more
drinkable
than
i
sadly
prepared
myself
for

still
all

in
its

which
is
a
misers
tradeoff
to
be
sure
whatever
im

my

for
that
i

westborough
ma
o
does
not
strike
me
as
a
typical
quad
but
i
found
it
a
pleasant
beer
to
drink
complex
notes
it
is
much
lighter
than
the
typical
quad
ive
had
if
this
is
what
triticale
delivers
however
brew
more
with
this
special
grain
o
this
is
great
i
saw
a
stone
quad
and
was
stoked
since
i
never
had
such
a
thing
no
let
down
one
bit
only
negatives
where
a
little
hot
on
the
aroma
and
no
lacing
to
speak
of
beyond
that
the
taste
is
amazing
and
overall
just
a
great
brew
i
have
tried
and
enjoy
many
of
stones
beers
perhaps
its
the
labels
pictures
of
evil
beasts
and
dark
ritual
symbols
who
knows
i
was
looking
around
the
beer
store
to
see
if
the
new
game
of
thrones
had
arrived
since
it
had
not
i
went
looking
for
something
g
different
this
caught
my
eye
as
i
had
trouble
with
the
name
it
was
in
the
cold
case
so
i
could
drink
it
right
away
and
it
was
made
by
stone
beautiful
amber
pour
very
light
head
that
dissappered
immediately
not
a
heavy
beer
by
any
means
went
well
with
the
sushi
i
ate
for
dinner
would
definitely
drink
again
the
spiciness
works
with
the
quad
surprisingly
well
it
aint
every
day
you
actually
find
something
unique
out
there
anymore
this
is
a
very
good
brew

overall
this
was
a
nice
quad
a
bit
too
sweet
for
me
overall
i
enjoy
quads
and
was
intrigued
by
the
triticale
grain
so
i
picked
up
a
bottle
its
not
as
big
in
flavor
as
the
trappist
quads
but
does
give
a
nice
drinking
experience
i
couldnt
really
tell
anything
special
about
the
grain
used
body
was
a
little
lighter
than
most
quads
ive
had
a
really
good
beer
overall
seems
like
a
fancy
list
of
ingredients
to
go
along
with
the
crazy
name
but
the
result
is
awfully
good
overall
a
nice
halftwist
on
a
quad
style
and
a
pretty
delicious
beer
beautifully
done
another
great
one
from
stone
overall
this
beer
has
a
lot
of
good
aspects
the
smell
and
feel
are
great
but
the
unpleasant
aspects
of
the
taste
keep
it
from
being
enjoyable
overall
a
decent
drinking
brew
but
nothing
special
o
tbh
i
didnt
make
it
through
this
bomber
i
was
really
looking
forward
to
this
beer
as
i
do
enjoy
quads
and
i
was
happy
to
see
a
nonhopped
up
stone
offering
while
i
commend
stone
for
experimenting
perhaps
better
would
have
been
just
a
nicely
done
barrelaged
quad
nonetheless
i
knew
going
into
it
it
would
be
different
i
would
not
buy
this
again
raisin
and
other
unique
flavors
for
a
quad
not
my
favorite
this
reminds
me
of
a
heavy
rye
ale
very
dry
and
not
the
sweet
maltiness
of
a
normal
quad
i
would
not
buy
this
again
should
they
brew
this
style
again
overall
a
less
than
satisfactory
sipper
frankly
mouthfeel
is
just
like
a
quad
mild
carbonation
that
dances
around
and
no
i
do
not
know
how
to
pronounce
the
nme
pours
a
ruby
brown
decent
initial
tan
head
very
malty
sweet
bread
robust
and
chewy
mild
hoppiness
lite
but
pleasant
finish
very
nice
beer
this
beer
pours
a
deep
red
with
a
lingering
tan
head
that
sticks
around
good
lacing
smells
like
fruit
punch
with
prominent
alcohol
the
taste
is
pretty
much
also
like
alcoholic
fruit
punch
with
a
good
pit
of
dark
candy
as
it
warms
decent
beer
but
not
great
and
dont
bother
trying
to
pronounce
the
name
o
another
really
good
beer
by
stone
but
i
expect
nothing
less
its
not
really
a
traditional
quadruple
and
nor
should
it
be
expected
to
be
one
being
brewed
by
stone
it
definitely
hits
some
totally
belgian
conventions
but
its
also
kind
of
apparent
that
it
was
conceived
by
a
brewery
which
generally
specializes
in
abundantly
bitter
and
hoppy
brews
as
there
are
some
surprising
ipa
traits
in
here
in
the
end
im
damn
glad
i
tried
it
because
its
not
only
flavorful
and
aromatic
but
distinctly
different
from
any
other
beer
ive
sampled
its
an
interesting
little
bastard
child
of
traditional
belgian
ales
and
american
ales
that
have
been
hopped
to
hell
this
is
the
bastard
stone
wont
acknowledge
hahaha
pretty
nice
take
on
the
style
would
probably
age

beer

i
would
like
to

has

bitterness
which
makes
it
very
drinkable
highly
recommended
and
i
would
definitely
buy
it
again
and
recommended
to
my
belgian
beer
loving
friends
d
a
nice
experience
overall
not
a
bad
beer
dont
know
if
it
was
worth
the
hype
some
people
put
behind
it
buy
it
and
split
it
with
a
buddy
might
be
worth
your
time
over
a
cigar
salud
its
a
little
bubbly
and
spritzy
not
lightbodied
but
a
little
shallow
for
a
quad
crispness
needs
time
to
calm
down
a
bit
which
it
eventually
does
and
the
feel
is
moderately
but
not
completely
clean
overall
not
bad
going
to
have
to
pick
up
a
few
more
to
cellar
overall
i
really
liked
this
beer
and
i
thought
it
was
a
good
and
slightly
unique
example
of
the
style
it
had
most
of
the
aspect
that
i
would
expect
from
a
quad
but
in
typical
stone
style
it
seems
like
the
flavors
are
bolder
than
they
are
traditionally
but
they
still
retain
nice
balance
this
beer
had
good
drinkability
it
was
smooth
the
alcohol
was
hidden
nicely
it
was
almost
slightly
cloying
rich
a
little
silky
a
little
filling
and
the
taste
did
a
good
job
of
holding
my
attention
half
the
bottle
might
be
the
perfect
amount
for
me
but
i
think
i
could
take
out
a
whole
bottle
if
i
really
wanted
to
what
i
like
the
most
about
this
beer
was
that
it
was
just
a
good
overall
beer
and
it
didnt
really
have
any
weak
points
what
i
liked
the
least
about
this
beer
was
nothing
but
i
do
wish
that
the
tritcale
was
a
little
more
noticeable
i
think
i
picked
it
up
in
the
aroma
but
that
same
aspect
didnt
stick
out
to
me
in
the
taste
i
would
buy
this
beer
again
if
i
see
another
one
i
would
for
sure
grab
it
and
it
throw
it
in
the
cellar
to
see
how
it
changes
over
time
i
would
recommend
this
to
anyone
who
likes
the
style
or
people
who
just
like
malty
beers
in
general
all
in
all
i
was
a
little
impressed
with
this
beer
i
havent
had
the
greatest
luck
when
it
comes
to
stone
and
belgian
style
beers
but
this
one
turned
out
to
be
a
pretty
good
beer
and
i
have
to
say
that
i
enjoyed
a
lot
more
than
the
past
few
other
stone
releases
it
isnt
my
favorite
stone
beer
but
it
is
one
of
the
better
american
made
quads
ive
had
and
i
would
say
its
my
favorite
beer
ive
had
in
this
series
since
i
didnt
care
too
much
for
the
grapefruit
beer
good
job
guys
this
was
one
enjoyable
beer
keep
up
the
hard
work
overall
an
excellent
take
on
the
style
its
unfair
to
compare
this
to
belgian
quads
its
stones
adventurous
approach
to
the
style
the
beer
is
very
balanced
from
aroma
to
finish
highly
underrated
will
search
for
another
bottle
to
cellar
pours
a
dark
copper
color
with
a
thick
fringe
of
mocha
trimmings
not
much
of
a
nose
on
this
cloyingly
sweet
9

bubblegum
beast
beneath
all
the
sugar
hides
a
bit
of
caramel
but
its
hiding
far
too
well
all
in
all
sacharine
sweet
and
then
some
im
one
and
done
with
this
brew
sadly
couldnt
even
finish
it
sorry
stone
for
what
im
about
to
write
starts
out
innocent
enough
nice
looking
ale
tawny
brown
nice
dense
head
lacing
as
the
head
dissappates
and
thats
where
it
ends
smells
of
too
much
tricale
too
much
rye
and
nothing
like
a
quad
aroma
has
a
burnt
quality
too
it
none
of
the
stone
fruit
plum
like
or
other
typical
quad
aromas
same
goes
for
the
flavor
im
looking
for
the
banana

says
is
there
clove
no
brown
sugar
no
thick
but
also
spritzy

beer
2nd
let
down
sorry
stone
the
flavor
is
better
and
more
like
a
quad
has
a
distinctive
but
very
well
balanced
and
interesting
mix
of
flavors
the
first
beer
ive
tried
from
stones
pet
project
and
i
quite
enjoyed
it
a
distinctive
take
on
a
belgian
classic
that
has
some
decent
aging
potential
though
im
not
sure
how
the
triticale
character
would
fare
over
time
o
this
is
a
delicious
brew
and
i
really
wonder
how
this
would
age
delicious
but
perhaps
a
bit
sweet
but
it
is
a
quad
so
thats
expected
botlted

22oz
bottle
served
in
pint
glass
beer
pours
a
wonderful
garnet
very
syrupy
in
viscosity
and
forming
nearly
no
head
aroma
is
rather
rich
suggesting
plums
and
currants
the
unique
grain
used
here
is
immediately
recognizable
as
contributing
an
unfamiliar
flavor
to
this
beer
theres
not
a
lot
of
hops
masking
the
peculiar
grain
bill
in
this
quad
theres
not
a
lot
of
the
yeasty
flavor
distinctive
in
belgian
3s
and
4s
what
there
is
is
the
distinctive
sweet
note
of
belgian
candi
sugar
but
im
actually
finding
the
flavor
a
little
bit
thin
considering
theres
clearly
so
much
going
on
here
gravity
wise
it
leaves
me
wanting
more
in
the
middle
of
the
palate
more
that
specialty
barley
malts
or
conventional
rye
malts
would
have
provided
but
this
beer
is
actually
intensely
drinkable
and
smooth
despite
its
9
3
per
cent
abvs
the
carbonation
is
also
thankfully
low
which
helps
overall
ris
aside
its
nice
to
see
a
stone
brew
that
isnt
a
in
your
face
hop
fest
nice
job
ooohh
thats
pretty
good
i
was
not
expecting
that
the
triticale
gives
it
a
hearty
sugar
cookie
flavor
and
blends
well
with
the
light
for
a
quad
fruitiness
lots
of
breadiness
and
is
really
smooth
mothfeel
is
full
despite
the
lighter
for
a
quad
coloring
everything
blends
together
very
well
i
am
in
the
midst
of
wondering
if
i
should
buy
another
bottle
or
two
rare
for
me
with
bombers
anyway
the
triticale
really
does
add
a
unique
dimension
to
the
beer
and
i
think
gives
it
the
deliciousness
i
am
finding
here
recommended
for
sure
big

big
hits
of
apple

there
are
other
fruitssuch

mango

slightly

my
biggest

is
that
as
it

the
esters
become
more
and
more
prominateover
powering
at
times
split
w
a
buddy
if
you
are
going
to
try
o
this
beer
offers
interesting
contrasting
complexities
that
you
wouldnt
normally
expect
from
a
quadrupel
as
the
spicy
triticale
balances
off
the
sweetness
of
the
candi
sugar
and
allows
the
dark
fruits
and
yeast
to
shine
through
eric
o
a
decent
quad
not
really
memorable
pretty
safe
straight
up
quad
o
not
stones
best
effort
but
certainly
not
the
worst
quad
ive
ever
had
it
seemed
not
to
have
been
pushed
far
enough
overall
not
idea
if
the
triticale
is
adding
anything
since
i
have
no
idea
what
it
tastes
like
this
isnt
a
traditional
quad
but
its
pretty
good
overall
a
nice
brew
but
not
something
to
write
home
about
this
beer
pours
fairly
dark
not
dark
like
a
stout
but
a
darker
shade
of
caramel
or
a
almost
maple
syrup
like
color
head
disappeared
quickly
and
was
a
almost
yellow
off
white
flavor
was
dominated
by
sweetness
after
reading
the
label
i
was
expecting
and
hoping
for
more
spicy
notes
in
the
beer
but
i
could
not
pick
up
any
i
am
not
as
familiar
with
this
style
but
the
beer
seemed
to
be
extremely
sweet
and
i
was
hoping
for
more
of
a
stone
twist
on
things
ill
have
to
try
this
triticale
grain
sometime
on
its
own
ive
had
triticale
beers
before
so
im
kinda
thinking
its
not
from
this
grain
and
is
more
likely
flavors
thrown
off
from
the
yeast
this
beer
improves
as
it
warms
its
well
rounded
in
flavor
and
aroma
with
a
big
mouthfeel
this
would
make
a
good
winter
warmer
still
i
enjoyed
it
immensely
poured
a
semiclear
reddish
brown
with
abundant
ruby
red
highlights
when
held
to
light
no
head
to
speak
of
and
no
lacing
an
interesting
look
for
a
belgian
strong
dark
not
the
best
through
scents
of
syrupy
dark
fruit
including
prune
raisin
and
dried
cherries
cherry
and
apricot
juice
notes
are
also
present
alongside
smokey
malt
rich
dark
bread
a
bit
of
an
earthy
rye
spice
and
a
noticeable
alcohol
presence
in
the
background
a
very
rich
boozy
and
malty
aroma
with
a
high
amount
of
dark
fruit
spiciness
and
smokiness
are
the
elements
that
arw
not
true
to
style
though
the
intensity
of
the
aromas
particularly
those
reminiscent
of
cherries
are
greater
than
in
the
trappists
rochefort
10
and
chimay
blue
and
in
the
abbeystyle
st
bernardus
abt
12
this
creates
a
bigger
bolder
aroma
than
is
typical
for
the
style
befitting
stone
flavor
begins
semisweet
with
flavors
of
liquorsoaked
dark
fruit
including
prune
raisin
and
fig
alongside
rich
burnt
caramellike
malt
a
bit
of
a
smokiness
slight
hints
of
burnt
toast
and
boozy
undertones
this
moves
into
a
semisweet
flavor
reminiscent
of
dried
apricots
and
cherries
with
ample
alcohol
flavors
and
some
sweet
dark
bread
smoky
and
caramel
malt
flavors
finish
is
semidry
with
notes

alcohol
smoked

and
dark

aftertaste
is
semidry
with
notes
of
burnt

alcohol
toasted
malt
and
spicy
rye
a
very
rich
complex
flavor
profile
in
many
respects
it
is
rather
true
to
style
though
the
burnt
toast
and
rye
spice
are
both
unique
twists
it
is
also
rather
boozy
even
for
a
belgian
strong
dark
still
quite
good
and
very
unique
mouthfeel
is
mediumfull
bodied
and
sticky
with
moderatehigh
carbonation
that
is
present
but
not
prickly
and
a
present
though
not
overwhelming
alcohol
warmth
a
very
good
sipping
beer
mouthfeel
that
is
quite
easy
to
drink
overall
this
is
a
good
attempt
at
doing
something
different
with
a
quadrupel
style
belgian
strong
dark
ale
the
aroma
and
flavor
are
fairly
true
to
tradition
in
many
respects
but
they
add
small
things
that
change
the
overall
character
and
make
the
beer
quite
unique
without
ruining
the
overall
balance
the
mouthfeel
supports
this
and
lends
the
beer
quite
nicely
to
sipping
a
good
twist
on
a
classic
style
well
worth
trying
overall
a
tasty
quad
but
not
the
big
delicious
treat
i
was
hoping
for
overall
not
bad
what
i
really
like
in
quads
is
the
big
fruity
esters
and
phenols
while
this
had
some
it
wasnt
a
ton
the
sweet
candy
malts
were
a
little
one
dimensional
like
but
the
grainy
wheaty
whole
grain
bread
biscuit
thing
was
really
interesting
and
unique
after
a
few
sips
this
really
just
becomes
the
same
thing
over
and
over
and
gets
a
bit
tiring
on
the
palate
too
bad
i
have
a
whole
22oz
beer
to
get
through
at
9
3
itll
be
along
end
of
the
night
a
decent
attempt
at
the
style
but
the
stone
edge
at
the
finish
does
not
work
too
well
for
the
style
i
hazard
to
call
this
a
quad
its
simply
a
poorly
done
beer
the
triticale
i
understand
is
a
hard
grain
to
use
and
that
shows
theres
no
design
or
expertise
on
display
here
i
dont
think
stone
knows
how
to
make
a
quad
or
use
triticale
the
best
i
can
say
is
good
try
on
the
effort
this
is
an
undrinkable
drain
pour
overall
this
is
fairly
tasty
and
worth
a
try
but
the
triticale
doesnt
really
add
anything
if
anything
i
would
like
to
try
this
without
the
triticale
but
that
was
not
the
purpose
of
this
brew
i
have
gone
back
to
this
one
several
times
it
has
yet
to
disappoint
i
really
wish
that
stone
made
this
as
a
permanent
offering
it
would
easily
be
in
my
goto
selection
based
on
the
value
price
to
taste
its
not
exactly
a
quadro
but
it
is
a
damn
good
beer
if
it
has
any
drawback
its
that
you
have
to
wait
a
bit
for
it
to
warm
up
to
truly
enjoy
the
beer
o
a
nice
take
on
the
quad
featuring
pilsener
malt
and
flaked
triticale
grain
dark
candi
sugar
and
ardennes
yeast
depending
on
your
tastes
this
may
be
hitormiss
i
happened
to
like
it
despite
not
being
the
sort
to
go
to
a
quad
very
often
like
every
stone
special
release
so
far
i
like
this
enough
to
recommend
giving
it
a
try
o
tasty
but
a
fair
departure
from
your
typical
quad
i
was
looking
for
more
spice
and
more
fruit
but
i
think
the
grain
overwhelmed
them
to
some
degree
this
read
more
as
an
english
barleywine
than
a
quad
im
glad
a
tried
it
but
probably
would
pass
in
the
future
overall
a
pretty
nice
beer
i
thought
it
was
a
little
too
sweet
for
me
poured
from
a
22
oz
bottle
into
a
belgian
tulip
glass
this
is
much
lighter
in
mouthfeel
than
most
classic
belgian
quads
for
the
most
part
the
taste
stays
true
to
the
style
with
a
bitterness
on
the
finish
overall
a
pretty
good
spin
on
a
belgian
quad
good
fruit
esters
with
an
interesting
twist
from
the
tritcale
grain
poured
from
a

a

full

with

very
balanced

spiced

smooth
slow
clean

tasty
beer
o
a
summer
relaxersipper
on
the
heavy
side
interesting
take
it
has
enough
things
going
on
to
keep
the
palate
interested
o
im
not
seeing
anyone
else
describe
an
offfinish
so
maybe
this
is
an
off
bottle
but
even
if
so
im
not
planning
on
trying
another
to
see
glass
stout
glass
bulb
snifter
a
rich
and
slightly
odd
beer
falls
short
of
what
youd
expect
from
a
quad
in
body
and
presentation
taste
and
aroma
are
on
point
but
a
bit
overwhelming
it
hides
its
alcohol
well
worth
a
try
especially
for
stone
aficionados
but
not
worth
going
out
of
your
way
for
this
was
better
than
i
expected
big
sweetness
sugar
caramel
was
a
huge
tone
in
this
quad
i
felt
this
beer
could
age
well
it
was
missing
that
extra
note
or
even
more
hops
i
do
get
big
rye
and
spice
when
the
beer
is
colder
as
the
beer
warms
the
sweetness
grows
with
the
big
caramel
sweetness
banana
flavor
as
well
overall
a
nice
deviation
from
the
traditional
quad
its
all
over
the
place
and
i
like
that
three
philosophers
this
is
not
and
i
like
that
one
too

poured
a
reddish
brown
with
virtually
no

some
sweet

yeast
dark

touch

citric

sticky

slow
sipping
there
is
a
touch
of
booze
in
this

the
yeast
keeps
it
smooth
and
there
is
a
mild
sugary
sweetness
pretty
much
caramel
and
maybe
candi
sugar
with
some
dark
fruit
flavors
like
fig
and
maybe
raisin
and
a
touch
of
citric
notes
with
orange
and
floral
clove
spiciness
the
triticale
has
no
flavor
presence
in
this
beer
at
least
to
me
although
from
other
reviews
this
could
be
the
floral
spiciness
i
am
getting
this
beer
isnt
bad
but
it
just
seems
to
be
a
little
messy
and
all
over
the
place
overall
interesting
but
ultimately
unsuccessful
in
my
view
i
just
dont
care
for
the
herbal
bite
of
the
triticale
just
doesnt
work
with
the
other
elements
of
a
quad
o
taste
blows
away
the
smell
gets
better
as
it
warms
up
damn
good
beer
taste
on
this
one
its
just
wow
a
great
belgium
taste
of
sweet
malts
and
that
fruity
taste
most
belgium
beers
have
the
spiciness
is
what
does
it
for
me
because
most
belgium
beers
that
have
spice
they
over
do
it
for
me
not
on
this
brew
its
a
great
blend
and
works
very
well
on
this
greatness
o
a
decent
twist
on
a
traditional
quad
with
plenty
of
the
dark
fruitiness
and
belgian
yeast
character
with
the
twang
of
the
triticale
pretty
drinkable
for
being
over
9
as
well
poured
into
a
gavroche
tulip
pours
a
dark
chestnut
amber
with
a
fine
halffinger
khaki
head
with
good
retention
and
lacing
aroma
of
mild
caramel
malt
apple
family
fruit
belgian
yeast
mild
dark
stone
fruit
sweet
flavor
starts
with
dark
dried
fruit
coriander
rye
sourness
brown
sugar
transitions
to
a
slightly
overspiced
odd
grain
flavor
probably
the
triticale
that
kind
of
reminded
me
of
the
lightly
vegetal
flavor
in
gluten
free
beers
finishes
with
an
interesting
but
somewhat
unbalanced
spiciness
from
the
rye
and
belgian
spices
medium
nearly
syrupy
body
with
light
carbonation
an
interesting
experiment
and
a
passable
quad
style
ale
but
not
comparable
to
the
traditional
flavors
works
as
an
odd
spicy
dark
fruit
belgian
style
ale
this
grew
on
me
as
i
drank
it
and
started
appreciating
the
flavors
for
the
nontraditional
element
they
represented
i
wouldnt
get
this
again
if
in
the
mood
for
a
quad
but
definitely
wouldnt
mind
tasting
it
again
pleasant
way
to
find
out
what
triticale
would
taste
like
in
a
beer
they
need
a
bit
of
quality
control
on
the
process
i
got
a
small
tuft
of
tribble
fur
in
my
glass
perhaps
not
an
outright
bad
stab
at
the
style
but
for
my
tastes
stone
should
stick
to
hops
and
their
annual
imperial
stout
this
just
cant
compete
with
most
other
quads
ive
tried
o
not
as
deep
or
rich
as
i
was
expecting
but
the
flavors
were
delicious
none
the
less
it
didnt
really
strike
me
as
quad
either
but
it
does
have
some
flavors
to
style
whatever
it
is
it
was
pretty
solid
and
worth
checking
out
o
not
what
i
was
expecting
from
a
quad
wanted
more
dark
fruits
got
something
tart
and
tangy
pours
a
clear
copper
with
a
foamy
beige
head
that
settles
to
a
partial
film
on
top
of
the
beer
thin
rings
of
lace
line
the
glass
on
the
drink
down
smell
is
of
toasted
malt
grain
brown
sugar
and
pineapple
juice
aromas
taste
is
much
the
same
with
malt
grain
and
pineapple
juice
flavors
on
the
finish
there
is
a
mild
amount
of
earth
bitterness
on
the
palate
with
each
sip
this
beer
has
a
lower
level
of
carbonation
with
a
slightly
crisp
and
medium
bodied
mouthfeel
overall
this
is
a
pretty
good
beer
with
an
interesting
pineapple
aspect
i
am
picking
up
in
the
smell
and
taste
missed
the
varna
but
not
nearly
as
good
as
the
grapefruit
slam
its
unique
sure
or
one
might
call
it
a
weird
quad
clear
reddish
brown
with
a
beigetan
cap
kind
of
fizzy
malty
nose
crackery
and
toasted
toffee
and
rich
grain
character
slightly
spicy
with
a
hint
of
citrus
lemon
dried
fruit
and
mild
alcohol
were
apparent
as
it
warmed
up
the
flavour
was
kind
of
one
note
mostly
a
sweet
toffee
and
nutty
character
a
bit
of
spice
citrus
and
alcohol
were
present
too
along
with
mild
bitterness
but
definitely
in
the
background
at
least
until
the
finish
decent
texture
mediumfull
body
with
moderatelow
carbonation
i
enjoyed
it
and
thought
it
was
a
decent
beer
good
overall
beer
poured
this
into
a
pint
glass
taste
of
candy
and
belgian
style
beer
not
too
much
to
say
about
this
beer
very
unique
and
should
be
tried
at
least
once
nothing
special
but
stone
does
deliver
on
great
beers
so
cheers
to
stone
brewing
pours
a
deep
mahogany
ruby
hue
with
a
big
head
fine
bubbles
looks
to
be
a
khaki
tan
head
at
that
fine
speckled
lacing
left
behind
as
it
dwindles
smoking
a
big
cigar
from
nicaragua
towards
the
end
of
this
beer
that
i
will
give
pairing
notes
to
as
the
beer
review
goes
aroma
deep
vine
ripened
dark
colored
grapes
raisin
sweetness
very
much
the
type
of
beer
i
like
with
my
cigars
sweet
complex
and
earthy
with
a
dark
wheat
base
it
looks
like
from
the
triticale
nomenclature
the
flavor
is
perfect
vine
ripened
fruit
dark
plums
raisins
exponential
malt
on
the
spectrum
of
fruit
profiles
limited
acidity
enough
to
balance
it
out
big
belgian
yeast
notes
bready
slightly
spiced
a
perfect
combination
this
is
really
good
and
will
only
get
better
with
age
mouthfeel
is
full
bodied
even
full
fermented
carbonation
levels
with
full
on
fruit
notes
bringing
out
each
burst
of
flavor
with
alcoholic
presence
available
with
each
sip
overall
im
in
love
with
the
whole
bottle
this
beer
is
going
to
age
explicitly
right
now
its
drinking
just
fine
cant
wait
to
try
more
of
this
one
overall
it
falls
into
the
wouldnt
turn
it
down
category
nice
to
try
it
but
dont
think
ill
be
buying
another
overall
i
have
no
idea
what
effect
triticale
had
on
the
end
product
but
i
would
assume
it
was
minor
vs
ryewheat
etc
that
said
i
cant
really
complain
sure
its
not
a
classic
quad
but
its
good
that
said
im
booking
a
flight
to
brussels
as
we
speak
one
of
the
weakest
examples
of
the
classic
belgian
style
that
i
have
tried
from
anywhere
stone
is
good
at
making
simpler
beers
but
not
complex
ones
out
of
bounds
all
the
way
color
is
not
a
double
or
triple
belgium
type
more
of
a
rye
style
that
you
would
expect
it
is
a
project
the
taste
and
smell
does
not
betray
the
faithful
at
all
if
you
close
you
eyes
and
drink
you
would
see
the
truth
it
is
classic
but
only
a
nice
different
it
is
a
triple
friend
plus
well
covered
with
a
rust
that
never
sleeps
it
delivers
on
taste
thank
you
for
thinking
outside
the
belgium
box
stone
of
course
belgium
beer
were
born
outside
the
box
of
germany
and
france
i
call
it
a
slavic
triple
belgium
beer
whatever
it
works
o
wasnt
sure
what
to
go
in
expecting
here
its
a
pretty
solid
quad
loaded
with
all
the
flavors
that
make
this
style
great
whats
so
nice
about
this
is
how
smooth
it
drinks
and
the
balance
of
sweet
alcohol
a
nice
end
of
night
sipper
medium
body
with
decent
carbonation
a
slight
syrupy
texture
and
a
pleasant
spicy
rye
character
that
adds
life
to
a
somewhat
blandartificial
tasting
beer
strong
candy
sugar
sweetness
with
cloying
syrup
and
faint
dark
fruit
flavor
some
bitterness
up
front
followed
by
peppery
spice
rye
and
cinnamon
this
is
followed
by
some
caramel
and
toffee
along
with
belgian
candi
sugar
cough
syrup
fig
plum
and
raisin
the
high
abv
is
very
well
masked
making
this
beer
surprisingly
drinkable
overall
im
not
sure
what
to
think
about
triticale
the
spicy
rye
character
adds
interesting
complexity
but
there
is
hardly
any
wheat
characteristics
in
this
beer
and
the
artificial
flavor
stand
out
taking
away
from
the
overall
flavor
pear
and
green
apple
upfront
in
aroma
with
notes
of
confectioners
sugar
adding
contrast
belgian
yeast
esters
dominate
flavor
is
more
muted
and
adds
dates
and
figs
in
the
background
fairly
sweet
but
the
finish
is
almost
resiny
and
bitter
wish
the
malt
were
more
prevalent
a
really
poor
beer
from
stone
and
i
know
they
arent
the
kings
of
the
belgians
or
anything
and
i
know
triticale
is
a
tough
grain
uncommon
in
brewing
and
an
adventure
to
begin
with
but
i
feel
like
they
could
have
done
a
lot
more
to
showcase
it
this
base
beer
is
weak
street
listed
only
flaked
triticale
and
pilsener
malt
on
the
label
the
watery
brown
color
must
surely
come
from
the
addition
of
the
dark
sugar
its
got
a
decent
tan
head
on
it
and
some
rising
bubbles
but
the
nose
is
odd
tons
of
leftover
sugar
but
still
harshly
bitter
i
imagine
thats
the
triticale
coming
through
pungently
generic
belgian
ale
yeast
does
nothing
for
it
the
flavor
is
just
appalling
i
mean
really
bad
and
it
takes
a
lot
for
me
to
say
that
about
a
beer
its
course
and
bitter
but
the
candy
sugar
doesnt
belong
here
its
sweet
not
fully
fermented
out
and
instead
of
balancing
the
intensity
of
the
cool
new
grain
it
simply
distracts
form
it
with
a
fake
maple
syrup
corn
sugar
kind
of
thing
its
gross
really
nothing
about
this
is
belgian
quad
at
all
and
the
yeast
is
not
strong
enough
to
clean
up
the
sugar
the
body
is
extremely
watery
too
even
with
good
carbonation
its
just
way
too
light
for
both
the
flavors
and
the
style
harsh
and
long
lasting
bitter
finish
from
the
grain
no
hops
here
at
all
really
unpleasant
i
am
not
sold
on
triticale
as
a
brewing
grain
but
this
beer
from
stone
was
a
poor
attempt
in
my
opinion
it
was
weighed
down
by
all
that
added
sugar
and
alcohol
and
really
misses
the
mark
i
suspect
a
pale
saison
may
work
better
with
this
grain
even
an
english
type
pale
ale
would
be
worth
trying
but
this
is
confounded
in
so
many
ways
definitely
a
drain
pour
overall
a
really
nice
easy
to
enjoy
big
beer
wasnt
overboard
sweet
too
hot
or
unbalanced
with
all
the
spices
and
yeasts
the
grain
really
smoothed
it
out
and
gave
it
a
unique
flavor
against
the
yeasts
and
spices
another
winner
from
stone
as
the
tritical
grains
assert
its
ryelike
spiciness
the
dark
burgundy
and
bronze
beer
is
largely
overcome
by
the
beers
melanoidinrich
malt
dominance
and
shift
the
balance
away
from
its
fruit
and
spice
dialogue
and
onto
that
of
malt
sweetness
notes
a
very
nice
and
interesting
beer
however
nothing
stands
out
to
me
i
was
not
blown
away
overall
okay
i
know
barrels
are
overdone
but
i
think
stone
have
proved
themselves
to
be
good
at
it
so
id
love
to
see
this
in
a
rye
whiskey
or
red
wine
barrel
as
it
is
i
think
the
sweetness
is
just
a
bit
overwhelming
but
has
a
ton
of
promise
feel
is
really
good
the
beer
have
body
and
carbonation
at
levels
lower
than
quads
usually
do
overall
this
is
a
very
underappreciate
beer
in
the
world
of
dipas
and
barrel
aged
stouts
it
is
a
great
beer
for
a
cold
night
poured
like
good
lovin
tastes
like
a
chutney
of
raisins
dates
and
figs
that
had
previously
soaked
in
a
vat
of
red
wine
the
texture
of
this
beer
was
lovely
as
well
tasty
but
ive
liked
other
years
better
this
quad
has
a
thickness
which
combined
with
the
potency
makes
it
a
true
sipping
beer
this
is
just
a
notch
below
the
top
quads
out
there
a
truly
great
beer
from
struise
unique
beer
similar
to
trappist
quadrupels
dark
fruits
and
imperial
stouts
coffee
i
liked
reserva
better

one

beer
ive

mature
notes
of

dried

madeira
and
a
trace
of

more
of
an
old
sweet
wine
than
a
beer
but
surely
irresistible
begins
with
earthy
cocoa
nibs
cream
and
toffee
the
smooth
mouthfeel
experiences
an
addition
of
bubbly
carbonation
which
adds
to
the
sweeter
toffee
presence
spices
become
visible
in
a
slightly
peppery
and
licorice
fashion
while
also
compliementing
to
the
sweetness
the
balance
remains
because
of
earthy
malts
along
with
hazelnuts
and
a
cocacola
note
finishes
with
a
gentle
coffee
note
which
isnt
bitter
at
all
due
to
the
more
present
cane
sugar
and
nougat
accompanied
by
a

not

not

by

a

the

the

continue

the

was

with
quite
a

that
seems
to
mask
some
of
the
alcohol
it
was
definitely
an
enjoyable
beer
one
that
went

im
not
entirely
sure
it

flavors
for
being
an
easy
drinking
beer
definitely
a
must
try
the
mouthfeel
maintains
the
balance
that
seems
impossible
almost
perfectly
it
has
to
even
out
the
dryness
biting
acidity
and
tartness
along
with
the
wood
and
fusel
notes
contributed
with
what
would
otherwise
be
a
cloying
and
sticky
sweetness
such
that
the
extreme
of
each
side
is
avoided
without
confusing
the
tongue
to
exasperation
the
body
has
lots
of
texture
and
while
full
edges
back
toward
medium
to
keep
from
being
too
heavy
crispness
is
firm
from
beginning
to
end
while
a
creamy
smoothness
takes
nothing
away
from
it
overall
this
is
one
quite
tasty
quad
this
one
is
on
the
tops
of
my
list
dark
fruity
nicely
spiced
and
yeasted
with
a
good
blend
of
a
warming
tastefeel
but
all
while
maintaining
a
great
drinkability
and
enjoyability
this
is
quite
a
nice
quad
this
may
be
worth
driving
20
miles
back
to
the
shop
i
bought
it
from
dark
and
rich
this
was
recommended
in
a
local
beer
shop
when
the
darkest
belgian
beer
you
have
was
requested
surprisingly
sweet
and
syrupy
this
isnt
a
light
dainty
beer
quite
heavy
but
even
on
this
hot
summer
day
it
still
worked
overall
fantastic
there
are
more
fruits
that
pour
out
in
the
flavor
but
its
definitely
a
roasty
dark
quad
caramelized
sugars
molasses
and
roastiness
overtop
of
lightly
vinous
black
grape
clove
and
raisin
the
body
is
very
solid
mediumfull
lots
of
carbonation
still
residing
in
this
bottle
the
conditioning
works
a
much
coarser
bubble
than
i
expected
my
taste
might
be
changing
from
the
same
that
makes
tsjeeses
it
pours
into
a
nice
head
and
an
almost
black
body
smells
like
chocolate
and
burnt
caramel
very
heavy
body
and
very
very
sweet
i
got
the
feeling
that
this
didnt
ferment
enough
i
couldnt
finish
more
than
half
a
glass
2011
bottle
poured
into
a
trappist
achel
glass
produced
a
half
finger
of
khaki
colored
head
with
a
chestnut
colored
body
and
reddish
hues
aroma
of
sweet
stone
fruits
brown
sugar
malts
and
bubblegum
yeast
the
taste
follows
the
nose
with
bubblegum
and
vinous
and
tart
stone
fruit
nice
brown
sugar
finish
mouthfeel
is
medium
and
creamy
very
light
with
a
nice
texture
overall
a
very
sweet
and
tart
quad
with
a
wonderful
mouthfeel
drinks
way
too
easy
for
10
recommended
if
you
like
your
quads
on
the
sweeter
side
overall
i
thought
this
was
a
very
nice
beer
and
i
thought
it
was
very
good
example
of
a
quad
im
not
sure
how
different
this
is
from
when
it
was
fresh
but
as
it
stands
now
i
thought
it
had
a
nice
amount
of
complexity
and
the
rich
malty
flavors
blended
well
together
making
for
a
pretty
enjoyable
beer
this
beer
had
nice
drinkability
it
was
smooth
a
little
dry
slightly
chewy
a
little
sticky
a
little
filling
and
the
taste
did
a
really
nice
job
at
holding
my
attention
ill
have
no
problem
drinking
a
full
bottle
and
i
wouldnt
rule
out
on
sipping
on
a
couple
of
these
throughout
the
night
i
think
this
would
be
a
nice
beer
to
enjoy
in
the
fall
and
winter
what
i
liked
the
most
about
this
beer
was
that
it
was
very
true
to
style
and
it
had
a
nice
amount
of
complexity
to
me
those
were
the
highlights
of
this
beer
what
i
liked
the
least
about
this
beer
was
nothing
but
it
kind
of
sucks
that
it
isnt
available
where
i
live
i
would
for
sure
buy
this
beer
if
i
saw
it
i
would
love
to
try
a
fresh
one
and
keep
some
around
in
the
cellar
i
would
recommend
this
beer
to
just
about
anyone
and
i
think
its
a
must
try
if
you
like
quads
all
in
all
i
was
very
happy
with
this
beer
and
a
little
impressed
it
lived
up
to
all
the
good
things
i
have
heard
about
it
so
far
i
think
this
is
one
of
the
better
quads
ive
had
i
think
rocherfort
10
is
still
my
favorite
but
this
would
be
number
two
this
made
for
a
great
first
impression
for
de
struise
and
i
will
for
sure
be
on
the
look
out
for
more
beers
from
this
brewery
great
job
guys
this
was
one
outstanding
beer
keep
up
the
great
work
o
i
wish
that
i
didnt
open
this
and
gave
it
to
someone
who
would
love
it
i
failed
on
research
pours
much
much
darker
than
the
other
quads
and
has
a
tan
head
aroma
is
coffee
raisin
some
vanilla
wood
notes
a
bit
oak
touch
and
a
lot
of
dark
fruit
taste
is
upfront
bitter
roastiness
but
then
explode
with
dark
fruit
and
complexity
this
is
really
good
it
has
a
licorice
touch
to
it
and
just
has
an
medium
full
mouthfeel
that
really
sticks
out
compared
to
other
quads
pours
an
opaque
super
dark
brown
with
a
foamy
dark
khaki
head
that
settles
to
a
partial
film
on
top
of
the
beer
tiny
dots
of
lace
form
around
the
glass
on
the
drink
down
smell
is
of
toasted
malt
molasses
dark
fruit
spice
and
slight
cardboard
aromas
taste
is
much
the
same
with
caramel
toffee
molasses
fruit
and
roast
flavors
on
the
finish
there
is
a
mild
amount
of
roast
bitterness
and
a
slight
alcohol
kick
on
the
palate
with
each
sip
this
beer
has
a
good
level
of
carbonation
with
a
crisp
mouthfeel
overall
this
is
a
very
good
beer
with
an
interesting
mix
of
aromas
and
flavors
all
around
o
awesome
i
got
this
in
december
2013
in
bruges
just
off
the
main
square
at
de
struises
personal
store
i
went
to
the
actual
brewery
near
westvleteren
earlier
that
day
and
was
disappointed
as
it
was
closed
bruges
was
all
set
in
christmas
lights
as
it
was
nearing
sunset
great
memory
enjoying
this
for
the
first
time
april

2014
o
not
as
sold
on
this
as
i
could
be
but
then
i
had
la
terrible
last
night
not
quite
as
complex
as
it
could
be
othis
is
a
great
easy
drinking
quad
i
love
this
beer
another
solid
belgian
quad
that
is
malt
forward
with
caramel
and
raisin
accents
very
complex
brew
all
is
fairly
balanced
between
esters
oxidation
and
malt
sweetness
other
people
at
the
tasting
claimed
that
this
wasnt
a
true
quad
with
its
overthetop
feel
and
while
i
understand
where
theyre
coming
from
i
somewhat
disagree
this
is
not
a
classic
rendition
of
a
quad
and
by
that
i
really
mean
that
this
isnt
the
version
popularized
with
the
trappists
offerings
that
broke
ground
commercially
in
the
last
century
given
the
experimental
nature
of
belgian
brewing
and
its
history
of
making
other
beverages
most
notably
wine
this
is
a
hardcore
rustic
quad
at
its
basis
with
new
influences
dsb
is
highly
inspired
by
american
craft
brewing
in
a
way
its
the
best
of
both
worlds
malty
and
rich
old
world
yet
hoppy
and
spicy
as
well
new
world
i
have
a
bunch
of
pannepots
aging
right
now
i
simply
cannot
wait
to
crack
them
over
for
the
next
few
years
this
is
a
very
very
tasty
quad
but
dramatically
departs
from
the
style
in
a
blind
tasting
this
one
stood
out
the
most
as
both
possibly
the
best
and
easily
the
most
different
definitely
definitely
try
this
beer
there
was
a
sense
of
trepidation
and
suspicion
when
i
started
this
as
there
was
a
sense
of
hype
amongst
geeks
i
knew
this
established
itself
as
i
very
well
constructed
and
nicely
diverse
beer
o
not
what
i
was
expecting
at
all
decent
but
possibly
past
its
peak
mais
uma
lendária
e
poderosa
cerveja
belga
overall
it
is
more
than
a
good
beer
im
glad
i
found
this
beer
because
i
could
drink
this
on
any
season
i
think
it
can
be
a
comparable
brew
against
any
quad
whale
out
there
roche
eh
not
really
i
change
my
mind
however
ill
buy
it
again
if
i
can
find
it
next
time
ill
buy
more
4
5
d
this
is
very
flavourful
and
rich
with
spices
and
that
bitter
herbal
quality
perfect
for
this
the
coldest
night
of
the
year
this
is
one
of
the
best
quads
around
great
stuff
o
a
solid
quad
but
i
had
higher
expectations
for
this
one
2011
vintage
loosely
a
quad
maybe
more
a
quad
that
i
think
it
is
i
dont
know
this
is
way
fruity
as
they
go
and
the
yeast
that
makes
belgian
beers
what
they
are
especially
the
big
ones
is
way
down
low
here
you
have
to
search
for
it
glorious
dark
color
though
deep
brick
red
brown
overtones
and
a
permanent
two
finger
just
off
white
head
the
nose
is
fruity
raisins
and
apples
come
to
mind
a
mild
spice
as
well
the
taste
also
prominently
displays
these
fruited
notes
almost
to
its
detriment
i
get
raisins
all
day
in
the
long
finish
one
thing
impressive
here
is
the
lack
of
alcohol
presence
for
a
beer
so
strong
very
well
disguised
this
drinks
like
a
6
brew
some
allspice
and
faint
belgian
yeast
in
the
finish
but
i
am
so
distracted
by
the
fruity
apple
juice
type
flavors
that
i
dont
love
the
whole
picture
for
a
beer
with
such
acclaim
i
expected
more
not
to
say
i
didnt
like
it
but
i
was
just
underwhelmed
the
same
was
true
with
the
reserva
version
so
maybe
its
something
about
this
beer
thats
just
disagreeable
maybe
its
my
messed
up
notion
of
what
a
quad
should
be
i
dont
know
full
body
and
lively
carbonation
is
very
nice
especially
with
the
absence
of
booze
even
at
room
temperature
a
fine
brew
but
not
really
my
speed
beer
is
mediumbodied
with
carbonation
of
low
intensity
resulting
in
a
mostly
smooth
910
and
slightly
foamy
110
mouthfeel
would
be
better
with
a
bit
more
carbonation
closes
dry
with
heavy
stickiness
on
the
palate
and
lips
o
a
very
complex
but
balanced
and
drinkable
beer
o
fantastic
quad
rivals
the
best
trappist
renditions
o
great
stuff
drinking
this
reminds
me
of
why
i
fell
in
love
with
beer
in
the
first
place
quads
this
is
so
balanced
and
full
of
flavor
i
highly
recommend
this
to
anyone

is

well

with
only

this
is
an

all
around
fantastic
complexity
balance

robustness
of
yeast
malt

flavors
and
very
smooth
to
sip
on
for
the
big
abv
an
insanely
delicious
offering
the
body
was
way
more
thin
than
i
look
for
in
the
style
not
watery
by
any
means
just
not
as
full
as
ive
come
to
expect
drinkability
was
of
course
excellent
the
only
tick
against
it
was
the
solid
alcohol
presence
it
made
the
beer
a
bit
too
sippy
for
me
overall
since
this
is
one
of
the
prototypes
for
the
style
obviously
this
was
a
top
notch
brew
a
must
try
on
any
beer
lovers
list
ill
grab
a
few
bottles
for
the
cellar
and
probably
put
it
into
semiregular
rotation
overall
hits
the
head
directly
after
just
a
few
sips
its
a
heavy
beer
and
though
it
has
spice
the
spice
doesnt
try
to
cover
up
the
distinct
alcohol
taste
and
body
in
this
10
quad
mouthfeel
is
mediumheavy
bodied
one
can
feel
the
carbonation
but
it
still
feels
a
little
thicker
it
leaves
a
residue
on
the
middle
of
the
tongue
overall
an
excellent
beer
served
in
the
right
glass
and
slightly
colder
48
to
50f
starting
temp
o
excellent
smooth
quad
amazingly
easy
drinking
considering
the
10
abv
reviewed
92607
simply
superb
should
be
up
there
with
other
world
class
quads
in
the
same
breath
as
westy
roche
st
bernardus
o
this
is
a
fine
quad
and
i
would
buy
again
and
recommend
to
anyone
the
beer
pours
a
cloudy
ruby
brown
color
with
a
layer
of
off
white
head
on
top
that
fades
to
a
pencil
thin
layer
around
the
edge
of
the
glass
the
smell
is
sweet
with
a
strong
dark
fruit
and
caramel
presence
im
also
getting
some
belgian
spice
in
the
nose
the
taste
is
quite
smooth
im
guess
this
has
smoothed
with
the
aging
im
getting
sweet
dark
fruit
belgian
spice
and
a
bubble
gum
like
note
the
finish
has
some
chocolate
in
it
as
well
but
the
sweetness
doesnt
really
linger
the
carbonation
is
very
fine
honestly
it
could
use
a
bit
more
the
finish
is
quite
dry
im
really
enjoying
this
beer
and
id
gladly
have
another
ohad
side
by
side
with
westy
xii
does
not
hold
a
candle
to
it
o
a
strong
beer
makes
you
think
and
applaud
the
complexties
i
will
look
for
this
one
again
for
sure
overall
nice
pick
up
not
knowing
anything
about
the
beer
except
that
it
was
from
belgium
a
little
pricey
when
you
think
about
it
but
thinking
again
you
spend
a
lot
more
for
crap
at
local
bars
so
this
i
tell
you
to
grab
a
glass
and
enjoy
salud
bottom
line
near
legendary
really
enjoyed
this
beer
would
love
to
get
my
hands
on
some
older
bottled
vintages
to
see
how
age
affects
the
flavors
overall
a
very
complex
creamy
smooth
oh
my
i
was
recommended
this
at
redstone
liquors
in
stoneham
ma
and
decided
to
take
a
chance
couldnt
be
happier
that
i
did
amazing
quad
loaded
with
dark
fruits
and
malts
but
perfectly
balanced
high
amount
of
sweetness
but
it
just
works
finished
clean
and
lingers
beautifully
world
class
quad
very
fortunate
to
have
tried
this
right
up
there
with
rochefort
10
and
so
subtly
different
it
compares
favorably
the
bodys
surprisingly
light
for
what
looks
like
a
stout
generally
refreshing
im
not
sure
i
get
the
hype
on
this
one
but
its
a
nice
enough
beer
its
pricey
and
im
not
seeing
myself
buying
again
unless
i
stumble
upon
a
really
vintage
bottle
this
being
a
2011
served
in
2013
could
use
a
more
syrupy
body
and
creamier
carbonation
completely
not
what
i
expected
going
in
ive
had
plenty
of
belgian
quads
but
this
is
so
much
different
it
has
the
typical
raisinplum
taste
and
smell
but
this
one
is
so
much
more
theres
a
hint
of
a
stout
as
well
coffee
and
dark
roasted
malt
also
theres
a
nice
oaken
flavor
to
it
i
would
call
this
one
very
complex
so
many
different
things
to
taste
in
this
beer
and
the
aroma
is
very
complex
as
well
i
very
much
like
this
beer
overall
wow
this
is
a
rich
wonderful
beer
its
complexity
lends
itself
to
deep
contemplation
and
when
finished
reflection
i
will
seek
this
one
out
again

along
with
the
huge

relatively
heavy

great
beer
quite
a
nice
quad
has
a
really
nice
brown
color
with
a
tinge
of
red
the
french
oak
is
noticeable
but
not
too
strong
there
are
some
fruity
flavors
floating
around
in
there
too
the
finish
is
dry
but
still
fruity
keeps
you
going
back
for
more
and
each
sip
lead
to
another
sniff
of
the
sweet
aroma
overall
out
of
all
the
belgian
quads
ive
had
this
one
is
so
much
different
to
them
more
characteristics
of
a
fruit
forward
belgian
stout
fantastic
beer
none
the
less
2011
pours
a
slightly
very
dark
brown
half
inch
of
creamy

settles
to
a

but
this
beats
down
the
rest
by
a
large
margin
overall
finally
got
to
try
this
beauty
lives
up
to
its
fine
reputation
i
need
more
o
a
magnificent
quad
i
would
rank
it
up
there
with
the
best
had
a
2011
vintage
bottle
that
was
kept
a
little
too
cold
so
while
i
thoroughly
enjoyed
this
beer
i
wish
i
couldve
had
a
bottle
that
was
stored
at
proper
temp
oh
well
dark
brown
syrupy
like
pour
with
little
tan
head
that
dies
quick
on
top
of
a
very
yeasty
citrusy
and
candisugar
like
aroma
definite
sweetness
packed
with
that
typical
belgian
orangelike
yeast
strain
as
well
as
some
pepper
and
sharp
spices
and
touches
of
dark
fruit
my
wife
detected
sour
fruit
but
cant
say
i
picked
it
up
mouthfeel
is
medium
to
heavy
a
little
thick
and
sticky
not
that
much
though
and
the
taste
is
similiar
to
the
nose
although
i
do
detect
a
sticky
syrupy
licorice
type
sweetness
good
amount
of
fruits
like
touches
of
citric
fruits
and
dark
fruits
figs
being
number
one
maybe
raisins
along
with
great
balance
from
sturdy
malt
backbone
and
the
abv
gives
off
a
complentary
edge
to
the
finish
and
helps
mellow
out
but
not
kill
the
beer
as
it
warms
great
sipper
and
a
definite
must
try
this
is
a
fantastic
beer
cant
wait
to
compare
it
to
the
2005
reserva
overall
a
really
nice
tasty
boldly
flavorful
quad
a
bit
too
much
sweetness
and
not
as
much
complexity
as
something
like
a
rochefort
10
but
it
definitely
holds
its
own
with
the
amount
of
flavor
it
brings
to
the
table
overall
its
a
fantastic
quad
one
that
i
feel
is
a
must
try
for
those
into
the
style
im
definitely
going
to
try
different
years
o
one
of
the
best
beers
i
have
ever
had
and
i
still
have
my
westv
12
to
get
to
yet
i
am
impressed
overall
another
outstanding
offering
from
struise
i
dont
think
theyve
disappointed
me
yet
upon
the
elegant
glass
pouring
aromas
of
my
late
aunt
grace
seized
my
nasal
passage
the
head
resembled
the
color
of
the
starboard
bow
rope
on
the
large
rigged
schooner
known
to
me
as
a
child
as
the
victory
chimes
as
the
head
gracefully
settled
to
a
thin
sheet
i
peered
into
the
glass
and
saw
my
own
reflection
as
i
looked
to
my
own
reflection
i
finally
realized
where
i
went
wrong
in
my
life
im
sorry
suzanna
as
i
tasted
this
ale
i
heard
the
rose
breasted
finchs
mating
call
in
early
autumn
fig
that
has
been
recently
been
in
a
snowstorm
cherry
with
a
rough
childhood
bark
off
of
an
old
wise
maple
tree
chestnuts
from
the
wrong
side
of
town
chocolate
that
has
been
melted
twice
frozen
once
melted
again
and
then
half
frozen
aged
at
room
temperature
ad
then
slivered
to
finally
be
melted
and
then
lastly
frozen
are
all
tastes
that
come
to
my
mind
while
i
drink
this
old
fishermans
ale
a
good
beer
but
im
really
surprised
to
see
the
overwhelming
love
for
it
here
its
possible
the
bottle
may
have
been
old
but
i
simply
didnt
really
connect
with
this
either
way
i
dont
think
my
disappointment
will
be
anything
but
a
slight
statistical
blip
in
the
lovefest
here
so
dont
mind
me
im
just
passing
through
overall
a
really
great
beer
id
put
this
a
notch
below
bernardus
12
bit
still
nothing
to
brush
aside
o
odd
for
a
quad
there
is
a
distinct
chocolate
flavor
in
here
that
is
unlike
other
beers
ive
had
in
the
style
it
blends
well
but
its
odd
the
flavor
is
a
bit
flat
too
and
the
beer
could
use
a
bit
more
carbonation
a
little
sweeter
and
heartier
than
the
trappist
versions
coffee
brown
with
a
tight
creamy
beige
head
great
spice
complexity
coriander
clove
and
cardamom
flavors
stand
out
over
the
malt
fig
and
cherry
fruit
flavors
meld
well
with
the
spiciness
caramel
molasses
a
dusting
of
bakers
chocolate
and
short
bread
full
and
slightly
sweet
finish
but
its
not
problematic
since
its
so
well
balanced
against
the
big
complex
flavors
and
a
hint
of
ethanol
some
hoppy
woodiness
rounds
it
out
obviously
a
beer
that
should
be
enjoyed
over
time
but
i
find
the
glass
emptying
quickly
oh
wow
so
warming
and
inviting
somehow
though
it
manages
to
avoid
being
boozy
which
could
be
a
bit
dangerous
needless
to
say
its
all
about
the
malt
and
the
yeast
a
little
bit
expertly
balanced
with
enough
body
yet
not
so
much
so
that
it
becomes
sickly
sweet
or
too
filling
o
this
is
a
beer
i
want
to
a
try
again
fresh
2013
this
year
and
b
age
and
try
a
couple
years
old
like
2010
in
a
year
or
so
its
one
of
the
best
quads
ive
ever
had
but
its
not
the
best
definitely
worth
a
try
when
i
try
another
bottle
i
will
edit
my
review
with
better
notes
nose
is
dark
chocolate
some
spices
nutmeg
clove
molasses
roasted
malts
and
bready
yeast
taste
is
a
bit
light
for
the
color
and
nose
bready
yeasty
spice
roasted
malts
chocolate
and
just
a
hint
of
booze
pretty
good
but
i
dont
feel
like
its
the
90
point
beauty
that
i
have
heard
so
much
about
overall
4
75
pannepot
is
an
incredible
belgian
quad
one
that
may
be
just
as
good
st
bernardus
abt
12
extraordinarily
refined
spicy
fruity
yeasty
bready
in
all
the
ways
a
strong
dark
belgian
ale
should
be
delicious
d
big
and
complex
while
maintaining
a
serious
amount
of
smoothness
pretty
much
everything
you
would
want
in
a
quad
not
sure
what
this
stuff
tastes
like
fresh
out
of
the
gate
but
a
2
year
old
vintage
is
very
tasty
if
i
had
to
guess
more
age
would
just
bring
forward
even
more
vinous
notes
that
i
detected
when
drinking
this
brew
definitely
worth
picking
up
if
you
are
a
fan
of
the
style
wow
the
flavors
in
this
beer
were
blended
perfectly
everything
complimented
its
counterpart
very
complex
aroma
and
flavors
one
of
the
best
beers
ive
ever
tasted
seek
this
gem
out
overall
an
absolutely
phenomenal
beer
one
of
the
3
or
4
besttasting
beers
i
have
ever
had
this
is
what
perfection
tastes
like
not
much
else
to
say
i
wish
i
could
buy
more
a
lot
more
othis
beer
my
first
from
de
struise
is
a
fabulous
example
of
the
style
the
flavors
are
wellbalanced
against
one
another
the
feel
matches
the
level
of
sweetness
and
carbonation
and
the
alcohol
is
fragrant
and
flavorful
but
matched
to
the
beer
i
will
definitely
have
to
try
this
again
with
some
age
on
it
pours
a
very
deep
dark
amber
with
glimmering
lighter
amber
highlights
beige
head
that
recedes
fairly
quickly
little
to
no
lacing
dried
dark
fruit
candi
sugar
and
hints
of
spice
on
the
nose
opens
with
raisin
dried
black
cherry
and
plum
hints
of
date
joined
by
rich
dark
fig
and
yeasty
esters
finishes
semi
dry
with
lingering
dark
fruit
spice
including
light
clove
caramel
notes
and
warming
alcohol
fullbodied
light
carbonation
smooth
light
syrupy
somewhat
chewy
mouthfeel
an
exceptional
quadrupel
that
is
a
must
try
for
any
fan
of
belgian
quads
overall
a
fantastic
quad
well
woth
the
price
o
i
had
never
heard
of
this
until
i
saw
it
hiding
in
the
bottom
of
the
cooler
in
my
local
nothingtoospecial
package
store
i
saw
how
highly
rated
it
is
and
decided
to
give
it
a
go
even
though
it
had
obviously
been
sitting
there
for
over
a
year
so
glad
i
took
the
chance
because
this
is
one
of
the
best
quads
ive
ever
had
beautiful
balance
and
pairs
well
with
some
havarti
cheese
cheers
it
is
really
a
very
good
beer
o
definitely
will
buy
again
as
many
as
ill
find
i
always
enjoy
quads
maybe
ill
even
put
some
age
on
newer
ones
this
is
my
kind
of
quadruple
the
blend
of
spices
roasted
malts
and
fruit
flavors
is
nearly
perfect
a
worldclass
brew
2008
ed
pours
a
clear

looks
near
black

with
a

that
has
absolutely
insane
retention

swathes

enormous

this
and
westy
12
are
truly
some
of
the
only
beers
ive
had
that
just
blow
you
away
but
how
endlessly
rich
and
complex
they
are
but
at
the
same
time
are
so
easy
to
drink
one
of
the
best
really
wanted
to
age
this
for
3
or
more
years
but
also
wanted
to
know
what
it
tastes
like
only
a
year
old
was
surprised
to
see
this
at
the
store
and
swooped
it
up
immediately
knowing
id
seen
ba
reviewers
talking
about
it
especially
surprised
by
the
price
point
will
definitely
have
again
o
this
beer
is
quite
worthy
of
the
attention
its
received
wish
i
had
additional
bottles
of
this
beer
o
i
love
belgiums
and
that
means
belgiums
anything
this
ale
has
definitely
opened
a
new
door
way
for
me
and
the
path
i
shall
judge
every
belgium
i
come
across
this
beer
is
really
a
piece
of
art
oa
delicious
beer
so
flavorful
and
smooth
a
great
after
dinner
beer
deep
brown
colour
a
little
auburn
shine
small
head
aroma
is
sweet
and
spicey
brown
sugar
dark
fruits
sweet
malts
taste
is
wow
some
sweet
cherries
in
the
beginning
sweet
liquorice
finish
is
the
least
sweet
perhaps
some
bitterness
quite
heavy
carbonation
no
alcohol
flavour
sticky
but
smooth
mouthfeel
heavy
body
what
a
beer
so
much
flavour
going
on
in
there
although
i
think
the
liquorice
is
a
bit
to
predominant
this
beer
goes
down
like
only
very
very
few
others
d
drinkability
suffers
due
to
the
high
abv
but
overall
this
is
a
world
class
beer
of
its
style
4
5
overall
this
is
a
fantastic
quad
put
it
off
for
a
long
time
glad
i
finally
tried
it
o
exactly
how
u
thought
it
was
going
to
be
solid
example
of
a
quad
and
definitely
would
drink
some
more
of
this
elixir
o
just
doesnt
hit
the
home
run
for
me
perhaps
the
absence
of
some
grain
or
bread
malt
results
in
the
lack
of
balance
i
am
feeling
here
overall
big
beer
nice
and
complex
with
a
lot
of
fruit
flavours
d
in
a
lot
of
ways
i
think
this
is
comparable
to
de
struises
black
albert
with
the
big
fruitiness
couples
with
pronounced
roast
and
earthy
bitterness
but
for
me
this
brew
shines
far
brighter
certainly
a
worldclass
beer
in
my
books
flavor
has
some
solid
maltiness
with
a
pleasant
level
of
sweetness
without
being
cloying
seems
likes
there
are
some
dates
and
raisins
in
there
plus
something
akin
to
rumsoaked
fruitcake
a
little
cinnamon
perhaps
as
well
as
a
hint
of
clove
finishes
dry
with
a
touch
of
bitterness
pretty
good
though
i
was
in
all
honesty
expecting
a
lot
more
prosit
1492
cheers
o
this
hits
all
the
right
spots
for
a
quad
dark
fruit
and
chocolate
without
being
overly
fruity
or
sweet
or
thick
o
this
is
a
nice
sipping
beer
probably
better
enjoyed
on
a
cool
autumn
evening
than
a
warm
summer
night
the
alcohol
is
not
too
well
hidden
and
the
beer
has
a
pretty
intense
flavor
with
some
sweetness
that
makes
it
a
sipping
beer
o
a
fantastic
example
of
a
quad
right
up
there
with
the
big
boys
o
a
quad
with
a
nice
touch
of
hop
flavor
cant
beat
that
i
bet
id
enjoy
it
even
more
if
it
were
a
more
recent
vintage
seeing
as
that
would
likely
have
a
more
pronounced
bitter
character
maltforward
flavor
supported
by
plums
and
other
dark
fruits
spice
tingles
my
tongue
towards
the
end
heavy
body
brings
the
flavors
together
before
finishing
slightly
boozy
on
par
with
abt
12
still
considerably
behind
westy
12
this
beer
warms
nicely
plum
fig
and
raisin
emerge
more
and
more
outstanding
o
of
the
three
this
received
the
lowest
score
not
because
it
is
bad
but
because
i
enjoyed
the
complexity
of
the
other
versions
more
this
is
an
excellent
base
beer
and
allaround
very
easy
to
drink
urbain
knows
how
to
rock
n
roll
o
very
very
nice
i
think
this
could
benefit
from
aging
though
this
is
one
of
my
favorite
belgians
yet
ive
never
had
it
fresh
the
other
one
i
had
was
aged
7
years
dont
pass
up
this
beer
its
simply
wonderful
overall
a
phenomenal
beer
tasty
and
complex
with
enough
uniqueness
to
set
itself
apart
for
me
this
is
right
up
there
with
rochefort
10
and
westvleteren
12
in
the
realm
of
quad
supremacy
slightly
behind
those
two
but
not
by
much
i
think
i
prefer
it
to
the
reserva
overall
tasted
side
by
side
with
a
2006
pannepøt
and
this
is
by
far
the
superior
beer
the
flavors
are
brighter
more
balanced
and
a
touch
less
sweet
than
the
danish
cousin
overall
a
must
try
for
most
any
beer
lover
flavor
expands
with
warming
with
light
roasted
malts
touch
of
alcohol
and
brown
sugar
feel
is
solid
with
a
decent
spice
feel
overall
a
quick
review
after
i
was
auto
logged
off
for
lack
of
activity
a
decent
quad
with
no
riveting
aspects
yet
nothing
to
push
you
away
either
poured
a
reddishmahogany
color
with
a
half
inch
or
so
of
creamy
tan
head
that
retained
well
and
left
some
doily
lacing
on
the
glass
aroma
of
belgian
yeast
dark
fruits
hints
of
cocoa
and
spice
sweet
caramel
malts
in
the
taste
toffee
dark
fruits
belgian
yeast
with
lesser
notes
of
cocoa
and
brown
sugar
slight
earthiness
in
the
finish
heavymedium
body
slightly
chewy
smooth
for
such
an
elevated
abv
nice
beer
overall
overall
a
beer
i
could
have
a
serious
committed
relationship
with
overall
this
was
quite
good
wouldnt
be
my
goto
quad
but
its
worth
seeking
out
o
a
pretty
great
quad
my
favourite
style
and
highly
recommended
would
drink
again
7
a
small
bottle
d
the
flavors
are
very
complex
there
is
a
lot
of
powerful
bursts
in
the
palate
when
sipping
on
this
the
spice
was
unknown
but
the
its
not
needed
with
everything
going
on
o
very
nice
beer
but
damn
the
foodery
is
expensive
12
for
this
id
love
to
try
this
again
but
it
seems
like
a
good
winter
beer
so
ill
wait
a
while
side
by
side
with
this

might
be
in
order
o
a
very
striking
belgian
ale
de
struise
really
hit
the
nail
on
the
head
with
this
one
while
the
flavors
are
deep
and
complex
they
play
off
each
other
well
with
no
one
flavor
taking
dominance
a
truly
fantastic
beer
b

b
2010

pours
a
dark

colour
with
a
thin
light

the
aroma
is
superb
with
fruit
and
nut
chocolate
alcohol
and
just
a
little
raspberry
vinegar
a
lovely
chewy
mouthfeel
with
flavours
of
rich
plums
dried
fruits
and
toffee

and

again
mild

and

a
little
dry
to
finish
with
a
peppery
linger
and
a
warming
alcohol
hum
mild
bitterness
and
subtle
sourness
are
superbly
balanced
overall
just
great
big
thanks
to
mrkennedy
for
this
as
an
extra
nice
suprise
indeed
ive
been
waiting
to
try
this
one
and
its
the
2010
vintage
which
pours
a
very
dark
cherry
brown
with
a
creamy
rising
two
finger
head
and
nice
lacingthe
smell
is
dark
cherriesoakbrandy
and
boozy
alcoholthe
mouthfeel
is
nice
and
full
bodied
with
tastes
of

and
finished
with
a
floral
bittersweetness
and
overall
its
really
nice
and
if
i
saw
it
in
the
shops
i
would
definately
revisit
cheers
2009
vintage
imbibed

the
scent
was
surprisingly
floral
for
the
deep
color
which
exactly
replicated
the
beer
bottle
color
and
the
taste
that
followed
a
taste
rich
and
dark
that
encouraged
me
to
let
it
ramble
across
all
the
taste
buds
in
my
mouth
before
swallowing
swallow
was
smooth
and
rich
initial
taste
was
rich
caramel
apple
with
a
hint
of
fig
a
rich
molasses
finish
with
a
bit
of
bitterness
that
was
initially
a
bit
difficult
to
overcome
as
if
the
caramel
had
come
within
a
whiff
of
being
singed
yet
i
found
myself
sighing
and
shaking
my
head
in
appreciation
after
each
swallow
i
dont
agree
with
the
boozy
comment
of
another
reviewer
this
beer
keeps
its
abv
under
wraps
the
glass
grew
on
me
as
i
continued
this
beer
is
a
sipper
i
am
not
sure
that
i
will
seek
another
out
but
i
will
be
grateful
if
one
presents
itself
o
a
very
complex
brew
a
bit
boozy
this
is
quite
fresh
but
melds
together
in
an
interesting
manner
its
sweet
then
a
little
tart
fruity
and
then
spicy
flavors
meld
nicely
once
its
warmed
up
fully
interesting
for
sure
will
have
to
try
some
aged
versions
overall
a
great
quadrupel
and
an
instant
favorite
of
mine
it
is
certainly
worthy
of
praise
and
acclaim
overall
on
of
my
favorites
in
this
style
the
spice
character
of
this
beer
really
sets
it
apart
overall
i
appreciate
this
as
a
very
complex
quad
despite
perhaps
having
a
selfconfessed
minor
prejudice
against
the
style
would
love
to
drink
this
again
a
further
5
years
down
the
track
i
bet
its
even
better

complex

looks

but
perhaps
the
nearly
6
years
in
the
bottle
has
really
reduced
the
carbonation
it
does
not
look
like
most
belgian
beers
based
on
carbonation
its
very
dark
and
very
little
light
gets
through
the
very
deep
brown
reddish
tone
the
smell
however
does
have
that
spiced
quad
smell
without
any
doubt
it
has
that
figgy
smell
mixed
with
spices
very
nice
and
no
booze
in
the
scent
what
so
ever
however
it
is
not
outstanding
in
anyway
but
definitely
above
average
now
this
beers
taste
is
basically
why
it
is
so
well
known
and
sought
out
there
is
no
sign
of
alcohol
what
so
ever
and
the
10
has
to
be
a
lie
it
has
all
of
the
flavors
you
would
expect
in
a
belgian
dark
beer
such
as
this
there
are
the
dark
fruity
flavors
and
spices
mixed
together
very
well
one
of
the
best
tasting
quads
i
have
had
in
a
very
long
time
and
i
am
really
not
into
quads
but
perhaps
the
aging
of
this
beer
has
been
the
key
the
mouthfeel
however
is
slightly
above
average
and
what
i
expected
its
got
a
very
low
level
of
carbonation
and
has
a
medium
mouthfeel
i
was
expecting
a
more
dry
mouthfeel
overall
this
is
solid
i
gave
it
a
4
because
its
great
but
not
making
me
go
and
purchase
the
last
one
i
saw
at
the
store
its
easy
to
drink
if
you
like
belgian
beers
however
there
are
others
out
there
that
are
better
but
nonetheless
this
is
a
very
good
beer
and
i
would
grab
it
if
i
was
you
to
try
and
see
for
yourself
overall
wow
where
to
start
pannepot
has
fruity
and
jammy
notes
without
the
underlying
cinnamon
which
i
find
to
be
ubiquitous
among
belgian
quad
styles
or
ones
that
are
double
dubbels
as
i
began
to
drink
and
finish
this
beer
i
noticed
it
went
beyond
the
style
and
i
ended
up
appreciating
it
much
more
as
a
stout
its
so
complex
rich
and
exactly
what
i
love
about
beer
the
ability
to
surprise
and
then
win
your
heart
this
beer
was
so
utterly
refreshing
to
try
something
that
went
beyond
the
style
to
produce
a
robust
strong
and
unique
beer
o
very
complex
and
enjoyable
extremely
easy
drinking
for
a
10
abv
starts
sweet
with
a
ton
of
dark
fruit
then
continues
to
play
with
your
palate
until
it
finally
ends
earthy
leaving
a
candylike
linger
this
is
a
very
unique
quad
sharing
a
lot
of
characteristics
similar
to
and
old
ale
or
english
barleywine
i
like
o
a
little
too
sweet
and
slightly
boozy
right
now
i
think
the
2010
vintage
needs
some
more
time
to
smooth
out
and
loose
some
of
the
overpowering
sugary
sweetness
i
picked
out
some
spices
but
i
think
its
too
sweet
to
really
appreciate
them
at
this
time
its
a
nice
quad
but
no
where
near
worldclass

me

just
wanted

had
to
pace
myself
because
of
the
abv
overall
a
high
quality
quad
but
a
little
on
the
spiced
side
for
my
personal
taste
notes
pretty
remarkable
and
maybe
a
bit
overhyped
i
like
it
but
not
to
an
extreme
and
while
not
bad
in
any
way
that

starting

might
not

o

really
enjoyed

thats

savouring
overall
a
nice
belgian
dark
strong
ale
but
ultimately
i
dont
find
it
worthy
of
the
high
praise
it
receives
ill
have
to
try
it
again
fresh
sometime
its
been
a
while
o
i
can
see
why
this
beer
is
in
the
top
100
it
is
so
amazing
and
wish
i
could
get
this
more
often
o
a
great
quad
that
stands
up
with
the
best
of
them
glad
i
finally
got
to
try
this
this
is
everything
i
want
in
a
quad
its
very
complex
very
heavy
and
genuinely
interesting
i
have
two
more
bottles
of
this
that
i
will
be
aging
to
see
what
happens
over
time
impressive
i
would
like
to
love
it
but
i
dont
o
a
hugely
complex
tasty
beer
i
was
surprised
at
how
light
and
drinkable
it
is
for
a
beer
that
packs
so
much
flavor
and
alcohol
i
really
wish
i
could
find
this
more
easily
where
i
live
because
its
a
really
excellent
beer
this
is
a
fine
high
quality
beer
of
one
i
wish
i
had
obtained
more
than
a
single
bottle
this
is
a
beer
that
i
will
seek
out
again
i
plan
to
return
to
the
bottle
stop
here
in
stevens
point
in
hopes
that
another
bottle
or
two
are
available
this
beer
will
likely
offer
an
extended
shelf
life
and
i
want
to
test
the
boundaries
a
bit
a
top
of
the
line
but
unique
quad
o
a
delicious
well
balanced
brew
with
a
flavor
profile
that
you
dont
see
every
day
o
this
is
a
really
good
belgian
quad
its
a
little
boozy
but
with
some
time
i
think
it
will
become
a
phenomenal
beer
id
definitely
get
this
again
if
it
wasnt
7
99
for
an
11
2
oz
bottle
as
it
wasnt
that
good
of
a
beer
creamy
mediumbodied
with
good
carbonation
somewhat
drying
in
the
end
an
excellent
pairing
with
stilton
and
a
great
quad
overall
this
is
perhaps
not
my
favorite
style
but
i
enjoyed
this
one
very
much
nonetheless
o
overall
i
would
describe
this
beer
as
elegant
this
is
a
very
good
quad
very
well
balanced
and
smooth
in
terms
of
drinkability
the
rating
that
used
to
be
this
gets
excellent
marks
this
might
be
one
of
the
smoothest
quads
i
have
ever
had
this
is
a
top
tier
quad
to
be
sure
it
is
the
first
that
beer
that
i
am
having
on
my
de
struise
brouwers
quadruple
journey
and
i
have
to
say
i
am
excited
for
what
awaits
me
overall
the
body
of
the
beer
is
heavy
and
the
finish
is
full
this
is
great
beer
for
a
cold
night
i
a
just
wowed
with
the
flavors
and
the
beer
profile
the
nose
suggested
a
spicy
alcohol
but
the
aged
tamed
and
rounded
the
flavor
sadly
the
beer
is
gone
and
i
am
wishing
for
more
o
this
is
a
really
good
beer
and
i
should
have
bought
more
than
one
o
a
very
sweet
but
overall
perfectly
balanced
beer
that
feels
complex
and
easily
drinkable
at
the
same
time
wonderful
beer
i
enjoyed
this
beer
but
i
found
the
thick
molasses
to
be
a
bit
detracting
as
i
worked
through
the
bottle
as
such
i
deduct
0
5
from
overall
and
score
a
solid
4
0
o
extremely
delicious
quad
right
up
there
with
westy
12
highly
drinkable
with
some
nice
warming
for
a
cold
fallwinter
night
a
shame
that
this
isnt
distributed
here
or
i
would
be
drinking
this
far
more
often
overall
impression
reminds
me
of
a
light
barleywine
almost
with
all
of
its
alcohol
and
booziness
the
mouthfeel
couldnt
get
any
better
but
fishermans
ale
what
does
this
mean
exactly
i
enjoyed
a
ton
and
you
should
too
get
your
hands
on
a
bottle
getting
this
for
175
in
belgium
is
a
ridiculous
treat
straight
up
classic
here
drink
whenever
possible
finally
picked
this
beer
up
today
vintage
2011
oddly
enough
i
have
never
had
this
one
before
so
when
the
beer
guy
at
binnys
suggested
it
i
knew
i
had
to
get
it
have
heard
that
this
needs
a
bit
of
age
but
poured
into
my
de
struise
glass
has
a
large
billowy
head
which
recedes
to
a
quarter
centimeter
film
on
the
top
of
the
beer
aroma
is
very
strong
very
heavy
with
dark
fruits
and
currants
with
a
little
bit
of
light
perhaps
cidery
aroma
theres
a
ton
going
on
on
the
palate
dark
dried
cherry
currants
and
prune
come
to
mind
with
a
bit
of
dry
coco
alcohol
is
a
bit
more
overbearing
than
i
would
have
hoped
could
definitely
afford
to
mellow
for
a
few
years
have
an
08
that
i
cant
wait
to
open
after
this
mouthfeel
is
medium
with
lively
carb
smooth
mouthfeel
i
really
like
this
beer
and
would
love
to
get
more
and
age
it
for
a
while
and
see
where
it
goes
o
very
nice
brew
i
set
one
aside
to
put
a
year
or
two
on
it
so
im
looking
forward
to
cracking
that
one
in
the
future
poured
a
very
dark
brown
a
couple
of
shades
off
of
black
dark
brown
head
with
a
thin
head
retention
of
a
light
film
nose
has
some
caramelized
fruits
lightly
booze
soaked
with
some
spirit
fruitiness
licorice
some
prunes
figs
and
light
grape
notes
taste
has
more
dark
fruits
light
chocolate
notes
dark
and
rich
malt
flavours
caramel
and
a
hint
of
roastiness
unbelievably
smooth
mouthfeel
great
creaminess
to
this
low
carbonation
is
perfect
for
the
style
an
exceptional
beer
with
great
complexity
i
would
love
to
revisit
this
on
its
own
o
i
enjoyed
this
a
lot
i
prefer
it
over
st
bernardus
12
o
pannepot
really
might
be
the
best
quad
out
there
in
my
opinion
this
beer
is
absolutely
fantastic
and
perfectly
balanced
not
as
sweet
or
light
as
bernardus
or
westy
not
as
dark
and
heavy
as
rochefort
o
this
is
effin
excellent
havent
had
too
many
quads
and
if
this
is
an
appropriate
indication
of
the
style
then
im
stocking
up
it
feels
a
bit
on
the
light
side
but
it
is
a
very
tasty
quad
the
drinkability
makes
it
perhaps
a
bit
dangerous
to
have
more
than
a
couple
around
haha
o
what
a
great
find
a
complex
fullflavored
beer
with
a
superb
balance
of
sweetness
and
flavor
to
complement
the
full
but
lightdrinking
body
this
is
a
beer
that
makes
me
want
to
make
a
point
to
of
drinking
more
quads
4
5
overall
i
need
to
do
a
sidebyside
with
rochefort
10
one
of
the
best
beers
ive
had
and
it
definitely
competes
with
westy
and
rochefort
i
dont
remember
being
blown
away
by
the
smell
of
a
beer
quite
as
much
as
this
one
o
i
was
thoroughly
unimpressed
with
this
beer
its
not
bad
by
any
stretch
of
the
imagination
but
quite
honestly
if
i
wanted
a
russian
imperial
stout
there
are
much
better
options
that
are
far
more
reasonably
priced
my
local
distributor
had
this
priced
significantly
higher
than
rochefort
10
which
is
what
i
consider
to
be
the
archetype
for
quads
if
you
are
searching
for
a
decent
quad
i
would
recommend
steering
clear
of
this
if
youre
open
to
trying
a
highpriced
russian
imperial
stout
this
may
suit
your
fancy
drinkability
a
very
good
beer
in
the
style
quadrupel
drink
at
cellar
temperature
the
taste
reminds
me
of
a
barleywine
because
of
the
sweetness
and
boozy
taste
but
i
pull
almost
a
maple
syrup
flavor
as
well
not
far
off
from
the
texture
of
maple
syrup
also
very
full
bodied
sits
heavy
on
the
tongue
too
sweet
for
my
blood
o
rochefort
10
is
the
best
quad
ive
ever
had
this
is
damn
close
ive
never
seen
this
anywhere
near
me
until
recently
hope
the
store
guy
doesnt
get
annoyed
at
me
buying
one
bottle
a
time
till
i
drink
his
whole
case
im
going
to
try
and
put
one
away
for
a
later
date
hey
you
want
to
know
if
this
thing
is
good
yes
buy
it
if
you
see
it
suckas
wowie
wow
wow
looks
great
dark
nice
creamy
head
good
lookin
quad
the
smell
is
great
rich
caramel
butterscotch
and
vanilla
not
cloying
but
medium
sweet
nice
mouthfeel
not
thick
at
all
like
most
quads
but
not
thin
perfect
the
taste
is
amazingly
complex
but
not
overwhelming
roasty
caramel
butterscotch
coffee
maybe
and
spices
raisins
and
dark
fruit
white
chocolate
and
maybe
light
banana
vanilla
and
oak
the
light
hop
comes
in
just
in
time
to
prevent
cloyness
and
dry
out
to
make
it
refreshing
this
beer
is
better
than
i
could
have
imagined
truly
world
class
and
elegant
i
feel
like
i
never
have
to
try
another
quad
because
nothing
can
be
this
amazing
i
feel
like
its
kind
of
stoutish
as
well
worth
every
penny
they
could
charge
15
for
this
and
i
would
pay
it
d
this
is
a
pretty
fantastic
brew
this
was
definitely
one
of
the
better
if
not
the
best
quads
i
have
tried
most
are
overly
dominant
on
the
malts
but
the
spices
in
this
are
really
well
integrated
and
make
this
a
very
enjoyable
brew
looks
like
i
will
need
to
stock
up
on
some
more
of
these
and
see
what
time
does
to
them
o
its
a
sipper
for
sure
but
there
is
no
doubt
that
this
is
one
of
the
best
quads
out
there
i
would
never
drink
this
one
every
day
but
i
would
have
no
problem
drinking
this
one
every
so
often
330ml

no

some

i
picked
up
some
fig
notes
molasses
or
burnt
brown

taste
mirrors
nose
and
got
really
complex
once
the
beer
warmed
although
the
palate
picked
up
some
cardboard
oxidation
notes
mouthfeel
on
the
full
side
of
medium
above
average
effervescence
leading
to
a
dry
and
slightly
sticky
finish
a
really
satisfying
sipper
this
is
a
world
class
beer
wish
i
could
find
a
bit
more
fresh
bottle
for
comparison
full
body
a
bit
syrupy
decent
carbonation
sticky
and
layering
on
the
tongue
a
really
nice
quad
full
of
flavor
the
alcohol
is
masked
well
and
another
great
beer
from
struise
quads
arent
my
favorite
style
but
iwe
enjoyed
everything
about
this
beer
and
the
others
mentioned
above
for
the
two
of
us
it
came
down
to
a
style
preference
i
like
a
challenging
brew
and
she
likes
a
wellbalanced
unassuming
brew
a
complex
compelling
and
just
plain
tasty
quad
that
is
somehow
greater
than
the
sum
its
parts
o
one
of
the
better
quads
ive
had
i
like
the
idea
of
a
quad
with
a
spice
presence
as
i
often
find
some
of
the
lesser
quads
to
be
overly
sweet
without
much
else
going
on
but
i
think
the
spice
is
a
little
too
prominent
here
it
also
would
benefit
from
some
tincture
of
time
and
the
next
time
i
buy
one
ill
look
for
an
aged
vintage
one
that
being
said
it
is
damn
good
just
not
on
the
level
of
my
favorite
quad
rochefort
10
overall
sip
and
enjoy
for
a
quad
this
is
damn
drinkable
i
had
it
on
a
bottle
before
and
didnt
love
it
this
i
did
like
not
super
great
but
good
would
order
again
even
at
9
in
kansas
city
o
wonderful
beer
one
of
the
best
ive
had
of
the
style
o
the
flavor
profile
is
exceptional
but
the
price
tag
for
such
a
small
bottle
makes
this
a
rare
yet
delicious
treat
overall
struise
make
so
many
quality
beers
that
i
have
high
expectations
going
into
each
new
one
i
try
this
is
quite
nice
but
i
dont
think
it
lives
up
to
my
lofty
expectations
o
im
impressed
best
quad
ive
had
to
date
lightbodied
with
decent
carbonation
pretty
good
but
i
much
prefer
the
reserva
instead
could
probably
use
more
age
to
mellow
out
the
alcohol
and
allow
the
flavors
to
permeate
through
more
glad
to
finally
have
tried
this
beer
o
overall
this
is
an
excellent
quad
probably
my
favorite
so
far
well
done
struise
overall
a
pretty
damn
good
quad
not
my
favorite
but
damn
good
i
dont
understand
the
fascination
with
spicing
a
beer
like
a
quad
that
already
has
so
much
going
on
ill
buy
another
and
sit
on
it
a
while
longer
price
10

o
a
very
good
quad
one
of
the
best
i
have
tasted
and
maybe
even
better
than
the
westvleteren
12
but
was
it
really
a
quad
i
somebody
told
me
it
was
a
imperial
stout
i
would
have
believed
it
this
is
a
very
good
beer
though
i
do
prefer
the
grand
reserva
very
solid
beer
not
the
best
quadbsda
but
you
could
never
go
wrong
with
this
beer
this
beer
is
incredible
overall
all
the
components
are
strong
without
being
overall
and
it
is
very
easy
to
drink
despite
the
abv
yum
worldclass
oomg
that
right
i
said
that
this
quite
possibly
could
be
the
best
beer
i
have
tasted
so
far
sweet
but
not
too
sweet
complex
and
downright
tasty
im
glad
i
purchased
a
few
to
cellar
and
drink
again
i
can
drink
this
bad
boy
any
day
of
the
week
any
time
of
the
year
nuff
said
t
rich
and
complex
flavors
molasses
raisin
skin
brown
sugar
banana
baking
spices
chocolate
and
a
hint
of
booze
on
the
finish
amazing
stuff
o
this
beer
is
great
no
wonder
its
top
4
fro
the
style
very
sweet
and
yet
delicious
with
a
slight
dry
finish
that
doesnt
let
the
sweetness
overwhelm
you
although
this
is
generally
not
what
i
look
for
when
im
craving
a
quad
i
congratulate
the
brewers
on
a
phenomenally
unique
interpretation
of
the
classic
style
o
overall
i
liked
this
quad
would
like
to
try
it
with
more
age
on
it
though
glad
i
have
a
bottle
in
my
cellar
d
my
first
de
struise
and
lived
up
to
the
high
expectation
exceptionally
well
crafted
with
layers
of
aroma
flavour
and
interest
just
about
the
best
mouthfeel
of
any
beer
ive
had
o
just
phenomenal
cant
wait
to
try
the
old
monks
ale
and
the
reserva
o
the
08
reserva
and
wild
pannepot
were
two
of
the
best
beers
ive
ever
had
and
this
follows
suit
incredible
flavor
depth
complexity
and
texture
that
is
nearly
unparalleled
id
put
this
just
a
tiny
notch
behind
the
08
reserva
i
need
to
get
my
hands
on
older
vintages
and
the
grand
reserva
pannepotstruise
might
become
my
most
abundant
beer
in
my
cellar

bitter

no

a

i
have
seen
a
reserva
i
must
pick
up
to
compare
this
too
the
third
tier
in
a
set
of
jewels
which
are
to
this
taster
equivalently
one
of
the
three
gems
in
a
series
of
beers
that
are
staggeringly
delicious
the
gran
reserva
and
reserva
are
the
other
two
well
named
the
beers
really
are
just
the
same
music
put
to
different
orchestras
time
may
well
be
good
to
this
beer
well
see
o
the
beer
definitely
tastes
strong
and
some
hints
of
alcohol
are
noticeable
in
the
taste
however
the
complexity
of
fruity
aromas
and
flavors
make
this
beer
a
good
one
to
sip
and
savor
picked
this
2010
bottle
up
at
my
favorite
beer
store
in
belgium
dranken
geers
deep
dark
mahogany
pour
with
a
creamy
beige
two
finger
head
with
good
retention
and
great
lacing
very
spicy
nose
with
lots
of
dark
fruit
toffee
caramel
and
vanilla
with
just
a
touch
of
cinnamon
and
metal
the
taste
is
very
bold
and
complex
with
figs
raisins
prunes
molasses
toffee
caramel
clove
and
coffee
with
a
hint
of
black
pepper
alcohol
and
oak
this
is
definitely
a
sipper
that
gets
better
as
it
warms
very
smooth
warming
slightly
syrupy
finish
with
little
to
no
attempt
to
mask
the
alcohol
but
in
this
case
its
not
a
bad
thing
at
all
a
great
beer
to
just
sit
back
and
enjoy
serving
type
bottle
o
a
big
beer
without
being
in
your
face
or
imposing
a
fantastic
quad
o
overall
world
class
for
my
money
you
really
cant
top
de
struise
in
the
quad
dept
the
barmaid
is
not
alone
i
approve
too
a
damn
fine
quad
quite
rich
in
flavor
not
overly
dark
fruity
good
malt
body
tasty
overall
an
immense
beer
complex
and
brilliant
big
tasty
sweet
malty
goodness
drink
it
overall
score
is
based
off
the
2010
vintage
o
quite
an
enjoyable
beer
while
perhaps
not
the
greatest
version
of
the
style
certainly
a
benchmark
tasty
smooth
and
very
repeatable
2010
vintage
this
one
pours
a
medium
to
full
in
body
dark
dark
raisin
brown
with
a
one
finger
frothy
light
beige
colored
head
the
aromas
consist
of
lightly
roasted
malts
light
cocoa
bready
malt
raisin
bread
and
cream
the
flavor
is
made
up
of
freshly
baked
raisin
bread
dark
fruits
light
cocoa
moderate
doughy
yeast
and
alcohol
it
drinks
very
heavy
and
is
certainly
full
bodied
it
warms
your
throat
as
you
drink
it
and
leaves
just
a
touch
of
alcohol
behind
as
well
as
some
light
chocolate
overall
its
a
fine
beer
and
definitely
a
well
made
quad
aromas
of
dark
fruits
roasted
malts
cola
caramel
and
yeasty
spices
tastes
much
like
the
aroma
lot
more
of
the
dark
fruits
prune
date
fig
caramel
and
cola
still
there
roasted
nuts
are
also
apparent
and
add
a
nice
balance
and
bitterness
the
mouth
feel
is
like
a
broken
record
with
the
struise
perfect
overall
this
is
a
wonderful
beer
but
i
still
think
is
benefits
from
a
year
or
two
ageing
overall
it
is
not
my
favorite
quad
or
my
favorite
of
the
pannepot
brews
but
it
is
one
i
can
certainly
enjoy
from
time
to
time
o
a
delicious
quad
that
im
excited
to
try
aged
very
smooth
and
balanced
with
the
distinct
flavors
evident
with
every
sip
cheers
overall
great
beer
one
of
the
best
in
the
style
o
went
down
pretty
easily
and
is
good
stuff
have
had
it
before
and
will
have
it
again
o
d
i
think
this
is
really
great
it
could
be
a
bit
past
its
prime
doubtful
or
could
be
that
my
cellar
isnt
as
great
as
i
thought
it
was
either
way
this
beer
is
wonderful
on
tap
at
burger
in
santa
cruz
pours
a
deep
oily
brown
completely
opaque
with
some
nice
khaki
suds
sorta
boozy
on
the
nose
some
raisins
brown
sugar
and
molasses
perfumey
alcohols
and
maybe
a
touch
of
acetone
mild
cherry
yogurt
flavor
is
raisiny
with
a
light
roasted
malt
finish
ginger
rum
assorted
dried
fruit
equal
parts
sweet
dry
bitter
boozy
a
nice
round
quad
but
i
think
it
falls
short
if
you
compare
it
to
the
westies
and
rocheforts
of
the
world
meduim
but
robust
body
on
this
good
soft
carbonation
overall
this
one
is
the
real
deal
probably
my
favorite
quad
taste
great
fresh
cant
wait
to
put
some
age
on
one
taste
hot
damn
so
good
not
a
lot
has
to
be
said
about
this
one
one
of
the
best
o
good
mixture
of
flavors
and
balance
this
is
a
great
quad
that
has
a
nice
balance
to
it
i
e
not
too
sweet
o
very
good
stuff
im
a
fan
and
am
pretty
sure
these
guys
can
do
no
wrong
dr
high
abv
great
quality
and
very
easy
drinking
especially
considering
the
abv
worth
a
go
for
any
beer
fanatic
price
is
excellent
for
the
quality
o
very
reminiscent
of
quads
such
as
st
bernardus
and
rochefort
extremely
enjoyable
especially
if
you
like
quads
and
other
dark
belgian
ales
i
prefer
this
over
some
of
the
trappist
quads
beg
borrow
andor
steal
for
this
one
whatever
it
takes
pannepot
is
a
very
very
good
belgian
ale
with
lots
of
flavour
and
great
complexity
of
flavour
the
appearance
could
be
a
touch
better
but
the
beer
is
well
balanced
and
delicious
quite
boring
i
love
destruise
but
either
there
is
a
lot
of
bottle
variation
with
these
or
this
has
aged
to
long
and
the
flavors
have
died
the
beer
isnt
bad
by
any
means
its
a
drainpour
though
just
because
its
so
bland
pannepot
is
an
exemplary
archetypal
strong
belgian
ale
whose
reverent
praise
and
reputation
are
fully
deserved
it
may
not
be
brewed
by
monks
but
it
drinks
with
the
balance
sophistication
and
composure
of
a
zen
master
whos
devoted
his
life
to
solitary
meditation
and
the
attainment
of
enlightenment
indeed
drinking
it
you
find
nirvana
the
mouthfeel
is
full
and
beautiful
perfect
carbonation
mediumlow
and
the
belgian
yeast
adds
the
extra
bubbly
quality
only
a
great
strain
can
overall
this
is
a
perfect
beer
i
recommend
it
to
anyone
who
can
locate
it
i
couldnt
fully
enjoy
it
at
the
bar
because
of
the
stupid
glassware
and
it
was
served
too
cold
and
i
couldnt
help
myself
and
wait
long
enough
but
it
was
still
spectacular
perfect
quad
not
hot
not
too
sweet
not
too
yeasty
or
dark
malty
just
perfect
deep
brown
colour
near

minimal

top

brew
excellent
slow

superb
have
a
bottle
of
westy
im
saving
for
when
my
dad
visits
but
this
is
the
best
so
far
the
monks
have
big
steps
to
follow
overall
a
big
bold
flavourful
ale
i
really
enjoyed
the
plethora
of
flavours
this
one
had
to
offer
a
bolder
nose
and
a
bit
of
a
creamier
palate
would
make
this
one
world
class
for
sure
however
this
was
still
one
of
the
best
quads
ive
ever
had
leagues
better
than
the
2006
vintage
i
had
a
couple
weeks
earlier
i
will
be
getting
more
of
this
when
i
next
visit
the
brewery
recommended
o
just
a
solid
quality
quad
that
i
would
drink
over
and
over
ranked
1
of
10
for
me
oa
very
nice
quad
with
plenty
of
unique
character
narrative
this
was
easily
the
worst
high
school
reunion
that
jacob
mellors
had
ever
been
to
and
he
had
seen
his
fair
share
his
obsession
of
crashing
high
school
reunions
started
simple
enough
play
the
role
of
the
muted
magic
the
gathering
player
the
forgotten
4th
chair
trombone
lay
low
it
worked
like
clockwork
the
open
bar
started
flowing
old
enemies
regailing
each
other
with
carrer
conquest
exploits
soon
jacob
soon
his
latent
abilities
went
far
beyond
the
scope
of
the
pedestrian
masses
that
he
regailed
at
the
strike
of
each
gala
3
hours
in
he
would
emerge
as
the
forgotten
socialite
besting
the
former
nerds
in
volairean
wit
intimidating
the
portly
former
jocks
with
a
panache
and
bravado
that
oozed
confidence
it
was
this
latent
power
that
fed
him
at
night
the
knowledge
that
his
unknown
ability
was
his
greatest
asset
however
he
could
not
drink
so
much
that
night
as
it
was
midnovember
and
class
reunion
season
was
in
full
swing
overall
this
is
a
very
tasty
beer
but
also
a
bit
of
a
labor
of
love
to
finish
strongly
as
its
a
delicious
beast
very
interesting
comparison
with
the
jewbilation
1x
series
in
that
they
look
similar
but
instead
of
a
sweet
malt
bomb
its
a
finely
balanced
tart
and
enticing
brew
very
nice
2007
vintage
beer
pours
with
a
dark
brown
color
with
light
traces
of
carbonation
trailing
up
the
side
it
pours
with
about
a
thumb
of
head
that
slowly
reduces
to
a
light
layer
of
foam
at
the
top
smells
of
yeast
clove
chocolate
malt
and
sweet
spice
the
nose
itself
is
rather
fragrant
and
lends
to
the
taste
taste
is
sweet
with
chocolate
malt
candied
sugar
hint
of
orange
peel
actually
thought
it
was
rather
sweet
on
the
whole
more
than
i
expected
near
the
end
of
the
drink
the
orange
peel
flavor
becomes
a
bit
stronger
and
a
hint
of
lemon
appears
mouthfeel
has
light
carbonation
and
becomes
rather
creamy
after
a
few
seconds
in
the
mouth
overall
a
nice
beer
but
rather
sweet
for
my
taste
and
that
sweetness
makes
it
a
bit
less
drinkable
than
it
would
otherwise
be
2007
vintage
a
fantastic
apperance
huge
tan
head
light
lacing
deep
mahogony
color
the
head
just
never
fades
away
warm
multigrain
bread
raisin
plum
and
belgian
yeast
on
the
nose
some
warm
spice
flavors
up
front
citrus
makes
an
apperance
then
a
complex
malt
bomb
raisin
and
dried
fruit
fruity
yeast
flavors
and
a
bit
sweet
and
cloying
on
the
end
no
sign
of
this
beers
abundent
alcohol
slightly
chewy
and
really
full
an
extremely
well
executed
example
of
an
iconic
style
hats
off
2007
vintage
aroma
sweet
with
a
hint
of
yeast
fruits
and
caramel
not
the
best
but
complex
and
alluring
appearance
almost
black
in
the
glass
with
a
moderatly
thick
cream
colored
head
taste
sweet
and
pleasant
with
a
sting
of
bitterness
just
towards
the
end
of
the
sip
in
the
aftertaste
youll
find
a
hint
of
coffee
and
honey
that
lingers
for
quite
a
while
palate
lightly
carbonized
and
creamy
makes
the
honey
taste
protrude
and
intesify
overall
splendid
beer
that
all
should
taste
overall
this
is
an
amazing
brew
something
different
in
the
realm
of
quads
very
malty
but
lacks
a
certain
complexity
that
many
great
quads
benefit
from
the
taste
is
similarly
sweet
not
distractingly
but
maybe
a
slight
bit
muchsmooth
dark
fruits
unique
but
once
again
not
quite
magical
i
wish
there
was
a
bit
more
of
a
bite
somewhere
but
theres
nothing
i
can
specifically
complain
about
the
mouthfeel
is
maybe
bit
undercarbonated
but
not
by
much
the
beer
could
be
thicker
but
it
is
quite
smooth
and
drinkable
i
cnt
complain
about
any
specific
aspects
of
this
beer
its
100
solid
but
for
some
reason
im
not
in
love
hrm
drinkability
and
overall
impression
the
drinkability
of
this
beer
is
is
excellent
each
sip
follows
the
last
with
ease
and
the
beer
is
disappearing
much
to
quickly
this
lives
up
to
its
reputation
my
overall
impression
is
that
this
is
indeed
a
great
beer
that
is
worth
seeking
out
and
trying
at
least
once
i
would
really
like
to
try
the
other
variations
of
this
including
a
bottle
of
this
one
an
aged
version
would
likely
be
quite
amazing
i
suspect
maybe
this
is
a
bit
past
its
peak
or
my
bottle
wasnt
ideal
it
was
stored
properly
really
very
good
outside
of
the
aroma
unless
thats
how
they
meant
for
it
to
be
the
gusher
upon
opening
leads
me
to
believe
different
though
drinks
very
well
this
beer
was
four
years
old
a
2007
vintage
and
i
loved
it
12
finger
light
tan
head
quick
dissipation
with
minimal
lacing
dark
brown
almost
black
opaque
body
no
visible
carbonation
really
interesting
nose
some
dark
stone
fruit
cherries
i
picked
up
some
fig
notes
molasses
or
burnt
brown
sugar
taste
mirrors
nose
and
got
really
complex
once
the
beer
warmed
although
the
palate
picked
up
some
cardboard
oxidation
notes
mouthfeel
on
the
full
side
of
medium
above
average
effervescence
leading
to
a
dry
and
slightly
sticky
finish
a
really
satisfying
sipper
this
is
a
world
class
beer
wish
i
could
find
a
bit
more
fresh
bottle
for
comparison
pours
a
very
dark
brown
color
almost
stoutish
the
head
is
a
strong
tan
head
that
is
thick
and
foamy
the
smell
is
of
belgian
spices
and
heavy
on
the
malt
with
a
strong
caramel
aroma
slightest
hint
of
vinegar
on
initial
whiffs
but
disappears
and
has
me
wondering
if
i
imagined
it
taste
is
strong
on
dark
fruits
with
a
little
bit
of
sweet
candy
slight
warming
sensation
but
no
actual
alcohol
in
the
flavor
its
bolder
than
most
quads
and
is
different
in
that
it
reminds
me
of
a
porter
or
stout
mouthfeel
is
also
thicker
than
most
quads
while
keeping
that
characteristic
zing
that
i
enjoy
when
drinking
similar
brews
overall
a
strong
quad
although
i
waaay
overpaid
to
try
this
a
well
done
quad
with
some
very
nice
complexities
that
shined
through
at
times
i
would
also
really
like
to
try
a
newer
vintage
to
compare
to
carbonation
is
perfect
mouthfeel
is
very
smooth
and
enjoyable
flavor
lingers
on
your
palate
for
a
long
time
after
every
sip
finish
is
nice
and
sweet
without
being
cloying
a
great
example
of
the
style
and
worthy
of
mention
among
the
other
legendary
quads
shared
this
bottle
into
a
snifter
successfully
pours
like
you
know
a
dark
red
and
brownish
hues
as
expected
really
nice
aromas
nothing
off
here
carbonation
and
mouthfeel
is
excellent
as
for
taste
and
such
i
really
enjoyed
this
quad
very
drinkable
lots
of
flavor
not
too
heavysweet
or
boozy
which
is
key
very
sufficient
and
pleasing
2008
vintage
poured
into
a
snifter
the
pour
is
dark
brown
with
a
thin
tan
head
the
aroma
is
sweet
with
lots
of
raisin
and
dark
fruit
notes
hints
of
alcohol
the
raisin
date
and
dark
fruit
notes
come
out
along
with
some
oak
it
has
a
lingering
sweet
finish
the
body
is
full
decent
carbonation
light
alcohol
feel
the
beer
was
surprisingly
drinkable
really
nice
quad
d
im
torn
this
is
a
good
quad
but
it
definately
doesnt
amaze
me
i
enjoy
it
as
a
whole
but
when
broken
down
into
parts
it
looks
weaker
i
would
never
turn
one
down
though
and
i
would
probably
seek
this
out
again
md
i
have
trouble
fitting
this
in
the
quad
category
because
it
is
so
different
from
any
quad
i
have
had
but
thats
one
of
the
great
things
about
this
beer
it
was
super
complex
really
interesting
i
was
never
bored
throughout
the
tasting
tons
were
going
on
with
it
and
it
really
worked
to
the
beers
advantage
really
easy
to
drink
not
much
alcohol
on
this
2
year
old
beer
so
it
was
super
smooth
just
an
awesome
beer
the
cpj
mouthfeel
drinkability
quite
heavily
bodied
definitely
a
sipper
reminds
me
of
a
wee
heavy
as
opposed
to
a
quad
delicious
dark
fruits
d
wholly
enjoyable
wish
i
had
more
of
this
the
price
point
does
make
this
a
bit
difficult
to
enjoy
but
still
a
great
beer
never
cloying
or
unenjoyable
and
the
alcohol
is
totally
hidden
in
the
taste
highly
recommended
mouthfeeldrinkability
medium
bodied
with
a
lot
of
fine
carbonation
that
leads
to
a
great
pillowy
mouthfeel
feel
is
usually
one
of
my
favorite
parts
about
de
struise
beers
overall
a
very
nice
beer
even
with
slight
what
i
think
is
infection
pretty
complex
flavors
hide
any
alcohol
presence
very
well
bottles
opens
as
a
gusher
once
i
got
the
gushing
under
control
the
beer
pours
a
very
dark
brown
with
head
that
quickly
dissipates
smells
spicey
and
tart
a
bit
of
a
sour
kick
that
im
not
sure
is
intensional
tastes
spicey
with
the
slightest
hint
of
sourness
i
think
this
bottle
may
be
showing
just
the
first
signs
of
an
infection
luckily
its
held
up
very
well
and
isnt
turning
too
sour
the
spice
and
malt
profile
meld
well
and
leave
this
as
a
very
tasty
brew
i
was
surprised
to
see
it
ring
in
at
10
percent
as
it
tastes
like
its
6
percent
overall
a
very
tasty
beer
and
something
i
would
definitely
drink
again
d
good
beer
not
worth
8
bucks
for
a
six
ounce
pour
i
would
like
to
get
this
in
a
bottle
that
i
could
enjoy
over
a
period
of
time
i
have
to
say
that
this
plays
out
so
much
more
agreeably
than
its
continental
wine
barrel
aged
sibling
the
booze
is
less
bodydeflating
and
a
better
overall
balance
is
achieved
from
the
complex
melding
of
flavours
pleasantly
sipworthy
very
nice
stuff
definitely
one
to
revisit
the
2006
bottle
emerges
from
darkness
and
clads
us
in
delight
dark
brown
heroic
a
lithe
head
raisins
and
prunes
bananas
in
the
background
they
comprise
the
nose
theres
a
little
more
spicy
complexity
but
its
hazy
the
beer
is
delicious
caramelly
raisiny
and
figgy
some
other
delicious
flavors
in
there
but
its
gone
too
quick
to
savor
the
hazards
of
splitting
a
bottle
ahhh
but
i
am
thankful
a
delightful
treat
from
a
dear
friend
thank
you
joe
d
very
high
with
this
vintage
the
beer
feels
so
goood
on
the
palate
you
just
cant
help
but
to
drink
more
and
more
alcohol
is
very
mellow
as
well
for
a
10
abv
beer
making
this
one
a
really
winner
this
was
good
real
good
one
of
the
better
quads
i
have
had
i
would
love
to
try
this
again
had
a
bottle
of
this
at
volo
in
toronto
i
believe
it
was
from
2008
i
forgot
to
write
this
down
but
that
is
from
memory
pours
a
ruby
brown
colour
with
almost
a
finger
of
offwhite
head
some
lacing
down
the
glass
it
was
served
a
bit
too
cold
but
as
it
started
to
warm
up
smells
of
dark
fruit
cherry
with
some
belgian
yeast
quite
sweet
flavour
some
spiciness
seems
to
come
in
as
an
aftertaste
medium
carbonation
for
the
style
nice
mouthfeel
a
really
nice
quad
this
is
an
awesome
beer
complex
full
of
flavor
but
gentle
graceful
at
the
same
time
the
booze
is
not
real
apparent
anything
that
compels
me
to
write
about
it
like
a
sentient
being
is
definitely
one
to
remember
dont
know
that
id
drink
multiples
of
this
in
a
row
but
it
really
hits
the
right
spots
excellent
d
unexpectedly
awesome
really
one
of
the
best
quads
iv
ever
had
and
in
my
opinion
should
be
ranked
much
higher
on
this
list
will
absolutely
be
seeking
this
one
out
more
often
as
it
has
very
much
become
a
go
to
favorite
taste
is
very
good
tart
and
spices
dark
fruits
and
sweet
dark
sugars
theres
a
nice
sweet
and
creamy
mouthfeel
with
a
fairly
dry
finish
nicely
carbonated
light
bodied
beer
is
very
smooth
i
think
ill
go
back
to
the
store
and
buy
a
few
more
of
these
2007
pannepot
bottles
as
this
is
an
excellent
quad
10
abv
33l
bottle
of
quad
beer
from
de
struise
a
brewery
that
is
quickly
becoming
one
of
my
favorites
and
i
was
very
pleased
with
this
beer
upon
opening
then
pouring
from
this
nice
2006
vintage
bottle
a
murky
dark
brown
color
showed
along
with
very
nice
carbonation
thin
but
nice
lace
that
held
its
retention
throughout
the
duration
of
drinking
it
i
had
some
difficulty
smelling
the
beer
initially
probably
due
to
it
being
an
older
vintage
andor
because
the
beer
was
a
bit
too
cold
but
then
as
the
beer
approached
just
above
room
temperature
smelled
dark
fruit
and
some
sort
of
belgian
candy
sugar
sweetness
along
with
perhaps
a
earth
wood
quality
taste
was
very
smooth
rich
and
indeed
malty
a
very
nice
complex
and
mild
sweet
brew
mouthfeel
was
smooth
and
soft
very
dangerous
beer
at
10
abv
thats
so
easy
to
drink
this
is
indeed
an
excellent
beer
and
one
i
would
gladly
orderacquire
any
time
drinkability
i
began
to
feel
a
bit
flushed
before
even
finishing
off
this
glass
there
is
definitely
a
kick
in
this
beer
id
limit
this
to
one
per
sitting
but
an
enjoyable
beer
none
the
less
i
would
love
to
try
some
other
vintages
of
this
particular
brew
a
truly
exceptional
beer
and
one
that
i
am
going
to
love
to
try
again
luckily
ross
sent
me
another
bottle
which
i
plan
on
aging
for
several
more
years
drinkability
a
very
tasty
highly
drinkable
dangerously
so
brew
i
will
definitely
be
picking
up
more
the
next
time
i
see
it
if
it
werent
for
the
writing
on
the
bottle
id
swear
that
this
wasnt
anywhere
near
10
dangerously
drinkable
only
the
richness
keeps
it
from
getting
a
5
here
the
mouthfeel
is
silky
and
medium
in
body
very
nice
the
10
is
definitely
hidden
well
this
beer
is
really
nice
stuff
and
im
lucky
to
try
it
on
tap
for
the
first
time
one
glass
is
certainly
enough
for
me
though
drinkability
pannepot
is
one
of
the
most
complex
beers
i
have
ever
had
but
it
is
still
insanely
drinkable
for
such
a
big
beer
to
be
so
well
balanced
and
easy
drinking
is
amazing
if
this
beer
was
easily
available
it
would
be
one
i
would
drink
on
every
possible
occasion
d
easy
drinker
almost
refreshing
like
a
summer
beer
but
with
more
taste
complexity
and
satisfaction
enjoy
it
slow
mouthfeel
is
great
for
the
style
semiheavy
body
with
a
cozy
carbonation
that
does
its
job
great
d
a
great
quad
one
of
the
best
ive
had
i
loved
the
taste
and
the
mouthfeel
was
perfect
would
love
to
get
some
more
of
this
i
think
it
was
similar
to
the
reserva
but
had
less
oak
and
a
better
mouthfeel
2007
vintage
lot
a
1
cc
big
thanks
to
lunch
for
this
one
in
a
past
trade
served
from
bottle
into
an
orval
goblet
poured
a
deep
brown
with
a
one
finger
light
tan
head
with
brown
dusting
from
the
sediment
sprinkled
around
maintained
phenomenal
lacing
throughout
the
glass
the
aroma
was
comprised
of
sweet
malt
chocolate
cream
subtle
spice
and
wood
the
flavor
was
of
sweet
malt
chocolate
cream
dark
fruit
slight
spices
and
subtle
alcohol
it
had
a
medium
feel
on
the
palate
with
mild
carbonation
overall
this
brew
blew
me
away
i
had
heard
rumors
that
this
one
was
good
but
had
no
idea
what
i
was
in
for
the
flavor
was
very
well
balanced
but
the
aroma
was
even
better
i
could
actually
smell
this
thing
from
over
two
feet
away
when
writing
my
notes
this
is
a
great
representation
of
the
style
without
a
doubt
so
glad
i
got
the
opportunity
to
try
this
one
a
very
flavorful
quad
many
layers
of
intense
fruit
and
complicated
malt
a
winner
very
drinkable
and
tasty
very
nice
belgian
quad
this
beer
pours
a
nice
chocolaty
brown
color
with
a
decent
level
of
ecru
foam
on
the
surface
the
smell
is
rather
nice
with
some
butterscotch
and
raisin
notes
on
the
nostrils
the
flavor
is
mostly
consisting
of
the
raisin
flavor
there
is
a
hint
of
whiskey
in
the
back
but
you
can
seriously
tell
that
it
has
mellowed
out
overtime
it
goes
down
really
very
smooth
but
is
hard
to
drink
too
much
of
it
due
to
the
higher
abv
i
really
must
admit
that
i
am
really
happy
to
be
lent
this
bottle
of
beer
it
is
one
of
the
better
quads
that
ive
had
it
is
clearly
the
first
vintage
one
ive
had
this
is
a
great
beer
that
doesnt
get
enough
recognition
a
very
good
quad
edging
on
old
ale
flavors
light
carbonation
and
a
medium
to
thick
body
very
well
done
and
goes
down
with
no
effort
overall
this
is
quite
a
candied
sweet
brew
at
first
that
turns
more
malty
and
bitter
with
alcohol
as
the
experience
continues
it
is
medium
to
full
bodied
with
a
modest
level
of
carbonation
very
drinkable
and
a
solid
balance
of
flavors
are
there
to
be
enjoyed
now
or
in
a
few
years
this
certainly
could
be
aged
for
awhile
drinkability
is
pretty
damn
good
for
the
style
no
alchoholic
burn
and
zero
cloying
characteristics
winner
d
pretty
high
my
glass
was
emptied
faster
than
i
expected
highly
enjoyable
but
availability
sucks
one
ill
surely
buy
again
d
what
a
treat
this
is
a
solid
evening
beer
pours
a
dark
chocolate
brown
color
with
a
generous
head
has
a
very
complex
aroma
that
has
hints
of
caramel
currant
roasty
malt
vinegar
oak
and
slight
hops
each
sublte
and
none
overpowering
as
good
as
the
aroma
is
the
taste
is
even
better
a
very
complex
taste
of
of
bitters
sweet
and
malt
with
a
nice
touch
of
oak
and
sour
on
the
finish
love
the
taste
of
this
beer
again
very
complex
in
aroma
and
taste
but
none
of
the
characteristics
overpowers
has
a
creamy
mouth
feel
t
complex
taste
here
mostly
chewy
and
roasty
malt
with
a
touch
of
caramel
coffee
definitely
coming
through
bottle
say
dried
fruits
were
used
but
not
very
detectable
imo
moreso
different
spices
and
touches
of
wood
and
vanilla
very
nice
and
with
a
kind
of
balance
pretty
good
would
like
to
try
one
with
a
couple
years
age
on
it
to
see
if
the
booze
subsides
a
little
letting
some
of
the
subtle
flavors
come
out
more
jd
d
10
hardly
noticeable
a
smooth
and
easy
sipper
and
tough
to
put
down
up
there
with
the
better
of
the
style
let
it
come
to
almost
room
temp
drink
this
for
dessert
or
pair
it
with
some
creamy
and
buttery
cheese
d
overall
the
flavors
were
a
bit
of
a
let
down
for
me
the
strange
bitter
profile
lowered
drinkability
for
me
for
sure
d
i
suppose
its
a
fairly
drinkable
brew
but
ive
had
better
quads
than
this
ones
that
arent
on
the
top
100
the
flavors
seem
to
be
just
a
little
muted
and
bland
for
a
belgian
brew
this
is
a
pretty
strong
flavored
brew
but
isnt
as
good
as
previous
years
it
should
become
more
mild
with
age
4
overall
this
is
an
amazing
beer
very
drinkable
tons
and
tons
of
aromas
and
flavors
i
will
definitely
pick
some
more
of
these
up
this
is
my
celebratory
beer
in
honor
of
roy
halladays
no
hitter
tonight
go
phils
pours
a
brownish
color
with
a
big
light
brown
head
in
the
aroma
white
grape
fruity
and
a
small
roast
in
the
taste
fruity
rich
malt
roasty
complex
maltiness
and
small
hint
of
alcohol
in
the
end
a
smooth
and
medium
bodied
mouthfeel
with
a
small
dry
and
fruity
aftertaste
quite
complex
rich
and
flavorful
and
hides
the
alcohol
ridiculously
delicious
2008
bottle
pours
a
dark
brownish
colour
that
isnt
see
through
at
all
decent
amount
of
foam
in
the
duvel
tulip
tastes
of
caramal
dark
fruits
with
a
nice
little
sweetness
to
it
very
damn
delicious
and
the
10
alc
is
hidden
quite
well
this
style
is
taking
me
by
storm
i
cant
get
enough
delicious
beer
with
the
exception
of
the
palate
which
isnt
as
lush
and
gooey
as
the
benchmark
quads
this
is
comparable
to
rochefort
10
and
westy
12
in
every
respect
a
truly
fine
offering
thanks
to
roland
russell
for
importing
this
beer
in
one
word
sanctimonious
the
mouthfeel
is
thick
and
very
creamy
the
head
retention
allows
it
to
have
a
bit
of
foam
in
each
sip
which
just
adds
to
the
mouthfeel
drinkability
is
very
good
its
an
excellent
beer
overall
its
complex
and
delicious
with
a
fantastic
mouthfeel
to
it
definitely
a
pleasure
to
drink
mfd
a
buzz
of
carbonation
initially
sizzles
the
tongue
but
ends
with
a
rather
smooth
dry
finish
a
little
boozy
still
with
some
lingering
heat
drinakbility
is
fine
for
a
10
quad
slightly
warming
but
nothing
abrasive
about
the
beer
strong
flavor
profile
makes
it
a
sipper
though
db
a
special
beer
i
really
think
it
has
a
huge
rum
and
whiskey
attribute
in
both
flavor
and
aroma
puzzling
it
takes
patience
but
it
is
also
quaffable
very
good
at
four
years
old
would
be
a
perfect
candidate
to
buy
a
case
to
age
if
it
could
be
found
a
new
era
in
my
belgian
ale
appreciation
drinkability
a
very
enjoyable
quad
i
really
enjoyed
the
big
roast
malt
in
the
finish
would
gladly
drink
another
d
wonderful
quad
and
a
wonderful
beer
mouth
could
use
a
touch
of
improvement
but
not
much
i
would
definitely
seek
this
beer
again
had
along
side
a
pannepeut
in
one
night
ended
up
being
the
more
dessert
like
of
the
two
came
out
the
same
color
of
coca
cola
but
a
bit
more
murky
and
a
bit
more
head
nose
of
belgian
cane
sugar
and
fruit
ester
interaction
one
of
the
best
feels
of
a
quad
ive
had
other
than
their
vintage
06
palate
of
belgian
yeast
funk
fig
sugar
that
expands
the
floral
notes
of
the
beer
rose
particularly
and
some
sour
plum
fruit
matched
with
the
sweetness
of
candied
orange
peel
decedent
cola
colored
beer
with
almost
no
head
tons
of
carb
gives
it
some
life
malty
full
aroma
caramel
and
tons
of
sugar
taste
is
malty
up
front
and
finishes
with
a
bourbon
alcohol
bite
overactive
carbonation
level
detracts
from
the
mouth
overall
a
somewhat
disappointing
beer
this
beer
pours
in
a
lively
way
and
is
a
deep
brown
color
with
a
thick
beige
head
that
dissipates
slowly
sticky
rings
of
lacing
dark
fruit
bready
malt
and
sweet
spice
aromas
intermingle
nicely
medium
body
with
a
refreshing
complexity
about
it
flavors
of
raisins
roasted
malt
chocolate
and
spices
are
all
present
the
finish
is
fruity
with
a
lingering
spice
and
malt
aftertaste
one
of
the
better
beers
i
have
had
lately
d
great
phenomenal
beyond
superlative
and
since
westvleteren
12
is
about
as
available
as
rides
on
the
loch
ness
monster
this
is
the
best
realistically
available
quad
in
the
entire
universe
those
supertasters
are
right
they
do
put
lsd
in
this
stuff
from
my
tasting
notes
on
tap
at
lions
pride
dark
and
mysterious
in
the
glass
with
a
small
but
inviting
head
almost
looks
like
a
stout
at
first
glance
nose
is
fanastic
and
unlike
any
quad
stout
or
dark
ale
i
have
ever
encountered
silky
smooth
mouthfeel
and
the
taste
like
the
nose
is
unique
and
delicious
abv
is
hard
to
detect
but
this
is
definitely
a
sipper
so
as
to
appreciate
the
beauty
and
complexity
of
this
beer
i
have
heard
it
said
that
these
struise
guys
think
they
are
beer
artists
im
gonna
have
to
agree
with
that
especially
because
i
can
only
afford
beer
art
and
not
painted
or
sculpted
art
one
of
my
alltime
favorite
beers
this
is
d
this
is
why
i
drink
beer
has
everything
that
you
could
wish
for
in
a
beer
all
in
all
a
big
disappointment
i
may
sit
on
a
bottle
for
a
couple
years
and
give
it
a
try
again
just
to
be
fair
the
aftertaste
will
probably
still
be
lingering
across
my
tongue
even
then
ugh
o
sweet
and
syrup
like
and
delishus
d
wonderful
i
could
drink
this
all
night
pours
a
very
very
deep
mahogany
with
ruby
hues
into
my
oversized
snifter
two
finger
head
that
subsides
pretty
quickly
the
initial
scent
is
of
cherries
and
possibly
some
orange
peel
sticking
my
nose
into
the
snifter
is
pure
deliciousness
like
i
am
smelling
a
richly
sweet
dessert
drizzled
with
partially
reduced
brandy
the
taste
is
very
sweet
with
dark
fruits
bursting
all
over
the
place
strong
brown
sugar
presence
lending
to
an
almost
portlike
quality
i
could
sip
on
this
on
a
regular
basis
im
interested
to
try
some
other
vintages
soon
overall
i
feel
this
beer
has
become
much
better
over
the
past
couple
of
years
and
i
dont
see
any
reason
to
believe
it
will
go
downhill
anytime
soon
with
that
being
said
its
great
right
now
i
will
definitely
be
buying
newer
vintages
to
age
by
far
the
best
quad
i
have
had
to
date
fantastic
stuff
very
enjoyable
beer
a
great
one
but
stil
a
bit
young
this
one
was
just
5
days
botteld
will
be
much
better
in
à
few
months
years

2
oz
bottle
into
a
chalice
pours
dark
brown
with
ruby
edge
almost
mahogany
onefinger
tan
head
with
good
retention
and
an
average
amount
of
lacing
nose
reveals
some
licorice
dark
fruit
plum
raisins
dates
figs
spices
nutmeg
coriander
cinnamon
brown
sugar
grapes
yeast
and
brandy
taste
at
first
very
sweet
then
moves
to
a
little
tart
with
tastes
of
plum
cherry
grapes
spices
follow
and
a
hint
of
chocolate
finish
is
almost
dry
almost
oaky
with
some
sweetness
and
alcohol
warming
beer
is
full
bodied
creamy
with
heavy
carbonation
abv
is
certainly
not
obvious
so
sip
carefully
this
is
an
excellent
brew
with
some
sophistication
and
complexity
i
will
absolutely
revisit
it
notes
im
surprised
somewhat
by
the
pannepot
and
pannepøt
the
former
smells
duller
and
is
more
spry
on
the
palate
while
the
latter
has
a
more
bright
nose
but
is
dull
on
the
palate
i
think
this
is
my
favorite
expression
of
the
three
tasted
its
a
little
more
brash
but
bright
and
spry
despite
being
4
years
old
then
grand
reserva
then
pannepøt
a
definite
sip
and
savour
brew
2007
vintage
and
i
would
love
to
see
how
this
would
age
further
i
could
see
it
doing
quite
well
for
my
500th
review
i
thought
i
would
knock
one
off
the
top
100
and
this
was
a
good
way
to
do
it
this
is
worldclass
i
think
i
like
it
more
than
rochefort
10
i
think
it
might
be
the
best
quadrupel
that
ive
ever
had
and
ive
had
pretty
much
every
significant
one
outside
of
the
venerable
westvleteren
12
the
complexity
is
incredible
but
it
is
also
easy
to
drink
i
think
that
nonbeer
nerds
could
immediately
take
a
liking
to
this
beer
especially
if
you
pair
it
with
a
rich
dessert
de
struise
tends
to
make
these
really
expensive
beers
910
for
a
11
2oz
bottle
that
are
also
totally
worth
the
steep
price
this
is
a
wonderful
special
occasion
beer
drinkability
this
beer
is
super
smooth
having
had
05
06
and
07
id
have
to
say
08
is
as
good
as
good
as
it
gets
love
the
flavor
and
carbonation
alcohol
is
well
hidden
and
burried
in
the
flavor
what
an
awesome
beer
i
can
have
back
to
back
servings
and
enjoy
each
sip
like
it
was
my
first
my
favorite
quad
to
date
yeah
better
than
rochefort
10
this
is
the
darkest
opaque
brown
quadrupel
with
a
nice
creamy
caramel
head
that
sticks
to
the
glass
as
drunk
and
diminishes
to
look
as
a
lost
coast
on
a
sinking
continent
the
smell
at
first
is
of
caramel
and
malts
but
as
it
warms
i
pick
up
banana
nuts
vanilla
and
dried
fruit
aromas
the
taste
is
sweet
and
strongly
malty
with
a
dryness
on
the
way
down
its
a
fullbodied
viscous
lightly
carbonated
pleasure
to
drink
and
had
i
more
of
these
id
not
stop
until
four
a
strong
delicious
brew

with

get
lots
of
plums
and
cherries
in
the
smell
with
some
candy
cane
and
belgian
yeast
some
caramel
too
taste
is
sweet
but
not
overwhelmingly
so
very
well
balanced
as
the
sweetness
is
cut
off
by
the

and
chewy
opened
a
2006
on
memorial
day
weekend
on
a
beautiful
sunday
still
going
strong
at
5
years
old
incredibly
smooth
and
drinkable
at
10
i
think
the
scent
beats
out
the
taste
but
this
particular
vintage
is
probably
one
of
my
alltime
favorite
beers
i
have
one
more
2006
that
i
will
probably
open
in
a
few
years
wheee
dogs
big
beer
poured
with
a
huge
light

fine
foamy
thick

and
some

color
is
lightly
cloudy
reddish
brown
aroma
is
malt
toffee
dark
ripe
fruit
leather
dark
earth
and
licorice
flavor
is
like
nose
but
with
big
sweet
and
some
bitter
body
is
excellent
with
perfect
carbonation
for
this
particular
beer
finish
is
like
flavor
plus
alcohol
warmth
and
is
fairly
long
nice
end
of
the
day
brew
maybe
even
a
second
d
theoretically
i
could
drink
this
all
day
but
man
you
really
have
to
sip
it
slow
to
enjoy
the
flavor
not
to
mention
the
10
percent
will
leave
you
a
little
off
if
you
session
this
guy
d
an
excellent
quad
worthy
to
be
considered
one
of
the
best
in
the
style
in
my
opinion
a
great
example
of
the
style
and
a
dangerous
drinker
since
it
goes
down
so
smooth
too
this
has
aged
wonderfully
and
could
go
on
and
on
for
even
longer
awesome
stuff
an
opaque
dark
reddish
brown
pour
with
a
huge
beige
head
that
left
some
spotty
lacing
and
hung
around
awhile
aroma
is
of
sweet
dark
fruit
cherries
sweet
malt
apple
chocolate
and
booze
flavor
is
a
pretty
complex
mix
of

and
finishes
with
a
lingering

it
was

not

surprisingly
fruity
should
have
been
more
clear
2006
vintage
boom
it
pours
a
thickly
cloudy
brown
capped
by
a
halffinger
of
thick
tan
froth
the
nose
comprises
most
of
a
spice
rack
brown
sugar
and
cinnamon
taking
up
quite
a
bit
o
space
potato
bread
and
some
green
apples
in
the
back
the
overall
effect
is
freshbaked
cinnamon
rolls
sitting
begore
a
glass
of
apple
cider
good
times
the
taste
holds
notes
of
yeasty
breadiness
brown
sugar
cranberries
ginger
spruce
light
pine
and
a
dash
of
bourbon
damn
this
is
some
tasty
shit
the
body
is
pretty
hefty
with
an
active
carbonation
and
a
very
easygoing
feel
despite
its
thickness
believe
the
hype
believe
that
fishermen
can
brew
some
badass
beer
overall
very
satisfied
with
this
beer
very
tasty
and
complex
will
definitely
opt
for
this
again
2007
vintage
popped
the
cap
off
this
brew
and
i
could
see
the
head
and
bubbles
slowly
start
to
creep
up
to
the
top
poured
this
beer
with
a
gorgeous
free
flowing
tan
head
the
color
of
the
beer
is
an
extremely
dark
mahogony
with
some
maroon
tones
coming
through
insane
nose
on
this
beer
believe
it
or
not
i
smell
red
bull
liquorice
plum
honey
roast
and
coca
cola
syrup
whoa
is
there
some
carbonation
in
there
the
taste
is
very
remiscent
of
the
nose
more
of
the
dark
fruit
comes
through
plum
nectarine
great
hop
bite
on
the
midpalate
some
raison
bread
and
a
melange
of
dried
dark
fruit
not
boozy
at
all
i
love
this
finish
it
lingers
on
without
being
cloyingly
sweet
and
sticky
i
really
would
like
some
yeasty
artisinal
bread
fruit
marmalades
and
some
mild
cheese
to
pair
with
this
beer
i
really
do
just
adore
this
beer
enough
said
twowthis
has
got
to
be
one
of
the
best
i
have
ever
had
there
arent
words
im
going
to
enjoy
this
if
you
ever
get
more
than
one
consider
yourself
lucky

the
06
07
and
08
at
nicks
house
in
loveland
co
along
with
all
the
other
struise
beers

this
session

06

a

rich

complex
and
tasty
the
07
was
similar
with
a
more
complex
finish
and
some
more
fruity
notes
the
08
had
bigger

stronger

of

malts
these
are
all
very
tasty
for
the
big

lover
taste
is
interesting
but
fairly
heavy
on
the

could
pass
for
a
christmas

with
some

up

the

can
see
where
the

toffee

complex
as
different

jump
out
at

times
through

but
i
gotta
wonder
why
take
a
good
quadrupel
and
throw
a
bunch
of
spices
in
it
notes
vintage
2007
very
enjoyable
and
very
complex
tasting
beer
so
many
different
flavors
come
out
while
drinking
this
and
it
has
an
ever
changing
taste
abv
is
very
well
hidden
as
well
definitely
recommend
trying
this
lively
carbonation
strong
smell
of
belgian
yeast
bananas
savory
spice
and
rum
soaked
raisins
taste
is
much
the
same
with
the
addition
of
leathertobacco
and
hops
not
as
complex
as
the
2006
should
have
aged
this
longer
still
very
good
my
favorite
quad
the
pour
is
a
very
dark
brown
with
a
gargantuan
tan
head
that
has
the
appearance
of
whipped
meringue
a
nice
sheet
of
lacing
is
left
coating
the
glass
pretty
well
aromas
consist
of
dark
fruits
belgian
yeast
various
spices
subtle
cherries
and
alcohol
this
beer
is
quite
tasty
and
certainly
a
good
example
of
a
quad
spices
add
an
interesting
aspect
to
the
overall
flavor
the
feel
is
slightly
sticky
and
sweet
with
a
little
warming
alcohol
kick
in
the
finish
good
stuff
cheers
d
you
can
never
go
wrong
with
this
one
and
im
happy
to
see
how
well
it
holds
up
to
aging
a
really
fantastic
beer
and
i
wish
i
had
bought
more
overall
its
a
good
beer
but
it
is
over
carbonated
this
may
be
due
to
the
age
on
this
bottle
i
really
enjoyed
it
its
an
excellent
example
of
a
quad
d
i
know
i
would
regret
later
having
too
many
of
these
in
a
sitting
but
it
would
be
sooo
worth
it
this
is
a
really
amazingly
complex
and
flavorful
beer
all
i
can
say
is
wow
i
really
went
in
with
somewhat
low
expectations
but
this
blew
me
away
highly
recommended
this
deserves
the
recognition
it
gets
and
in
my
opinion
is
probably
underrated
drinks
quite
nicely
for
a
ten
percent
beer
a
top
notch
quad
that
has
aged
very
well
recommended
really
a
disappointment
given
how
high
my
expectations
were
for
this
beer
i
thought
maybe
the
bottle
was
infected
but
given
the
fact
that
i
opened
two
that
is
probably
unlikely
3
5
d
excellent
smelling
with
a
good
taste
but
the
aftertaste
doesnt
do
it
for
me
at
6
it
was
well
worth
it
because
the
nose
was
phenominal
dthis
is
an
amazing
beer
and
one
that
lives
up
to
the
hype
that
i
have
heard
i
had
the
reserva
recently
and
this
was
much
nicer
bigger
smoother
and
more
complex
fantastic
beer
and
truly
glad
to
have
it
after
it
had
a
few
years
overall
i
wasnt
too
impressed
might
just
be
a
bad
bottle
id
be
willing
to
try
it
againbut
nothing
about
this
really
blew
me
away
d
i
have
a
couple
more
of
these
sitting
around
and
i
cant
wait
to
try
another
one
these
seem
to
just
be
getting
better
and
better
with
some
age
on
them
an
11
2
ounce
bottle
vintage
2006
uncapped
and
poured
into
my
allagash
tulip
the
quad
appears
a
cloudy
dark
chestnut
color
with
about
an
inch
of
fluffy
ecru
foam
the
aromas
and
flavors
consist
of
spices
clove
maybe
chocolate
prunes
raisins
plums
brown
sugar
molasses
a
bit
of
roasted
and
toasted
grains
dark
cherries
really
complex
nose
it
trumps
the
flavors
by
a
squeak
the
ale
approaches
full
bodied
with
quite
lively
carbonation
a
tasty
quad
overall
cheers
and
heres
looking
forward
to
another
amazing
years
worth
of
delicious
beer
drinkability
crazy
good
10
who
cares
this
beer
is
out
of
this
world
sorry
rochefort10
best
quad
to
date
overall
a
delicous
and
drinkable
beer
rarity
and
cost
make
this
a
well
deserved
treat
drinkability
is
this
really
a
quad
seems
like
the
2007
has
mellowed
out
nicely
though
i
cant
compare
as
the
price
tag
around
9
has
to
knock
it
down
for
such
a
small
bottle
even
though
i
know
its
tough
to
find
in
the
states
or
at
least
it
was
for
me
i
loved
black
albert
and
this
is
no
difference
ill
try
as
many
in
the
future
from
de
struise
as
i
can
get
my
hands
on
this
is
a
drinkable
brew
but
this
is
definitely
a
sipper
due
to
the
abv
carbonation
sweetness
very
rich
in
the
end
wellbalanced
and
a
joy
to
drink
its
definitely
not
a
standard
quad
but
its
still
awesome
no
matter
how
you
slice
it
another
fantastic
beer
from
struise
it
is
not
a
stout
as
black
albert
but
a
fantastic
black
winter
ale
i
must
admit
to
prefer
the
2007
version
than
the
2008
one
the
2008
is
more
vinous
and
heavier
the
2007
is
perfect
its
spicy
with
dark
fruits
flavors
onctuous
and
easy
to
drink
yummy
mommy
solid
beer
overall
would
like
to
try
it
again
definately
not
my
favorite
bottle
pours
opaque
dark
brown
with
a
tan
head
that
lingers
during
the
whole
glass
and
laces
from
top
to
bottom
aroma
is
sweet
spicy
yeasty
and
has
a
touch
of
alcohol
to
it
flavor
is
amazing
dark
fruit
candi
sugars
biscuit
yeast
and
alcohol
overall
is
a
great
brew
very
drinkable
excellent
beer
i
have
been
drinking
this
same
case
of
the
2007
for
over
a
year
now
and
so
far
it
has
continued
to
get
better
i
havent
taken
notes
from
any
other
tastings
but
in
my
opinion
it
has
improved
ill
try
to
take
notes
on
my
last
5
i
got
certainly
plenty
of
interesting
aspects
of
this
beer
i
could
see
this
going
well
with
food
or
even
better
dessert
ill
probably
grab
another
bottle
sometime
to
bring
to
a
nice
byo
restaurant
pours
black
with
some
ruby
highlights
and
some
big
sandy
head
a
bit
of
a
gusher
even
after
sitting
for
a
while
head
sticks
around
for
most
of
the
brew
smell
is
quady
with
some
clove
dark
fruit
alcohol
etc
but
much
bigger
on
the
spice
almost
cinnamon
and
nutmegy
and
molasses
as
compared
to
other
quads
ive
had
big
belgian
spices
some
roasted
malt
on
the
finish
some
sweet
alcohol
dark
fruit
cherries
dates
warming
alcohol
finish
tremendous
quad
very
smooth
and
creamy
filling
on
the
feel
tremendous
drinkability
one
of
my
favorite
quads
vintage
2006
pours
deathly
black
with
over
an
inch
of
thick
brown
head
some
nice
head
retention
and
middling
lace
aromas
of
grape
juice
toffee
candi
sugar
and
spiciness
tastes
of
red
grapes
toasty
malts
spicy
on
the
midpalate
sweet
toasty
bready
malt
finish
with
a
drying
vinous
character
full
bodied
nicely
thick
moderately
high
carbonation
levels
it
seems
like
it
should
be
thicker
and
maltier
maybe
a
bit
less
carbonation
would
be
preferred
this
is
a
pretty
tasty
beer
though
not
as
tasty
as
some
of
the
more
readily
available
brews
it
just
doesnt
seem
as
rich
as
i
would
prefer
reviewed
from
my
tasting
notes
served
in
a
snifter
at
the
lions
pride
the
beer
is
colored
a
very
dark
shade
of
brown
it
is
too
dark
too
see
anything
through
it
except
for
a
faint
glow
caused
by
a
bright
light
there
was
a
small
head
of
tiny
tan
bubbles
it
quickly
settled
to
skim
of
foam
there
was
a
little
bit
of
lacing
left
by
the
settling
but
a
great
amount
of
lacing
occurred
as
i
began
to
drink
the
beer
the
old
fishermans
ale
smells
nothing
like
an
old
fisherman
it
is
mainly
sweet
with
plenty
of
spices
i
think
i
can
detect
aromas
of
clove
and
date
but
identifying
smells
is
one
of
my
weak
points
so
i
cant
do
this
aroma
justice
i
find
it
be
very
pleasant
and
a
perfect
compliment
to
the
amazing
flavor
this
beer
possesses
i
taste
plums
and
dates
it
is
a
bit
sweet
but
not
as
sweet
as
other
quads
and
high
alcohol
brews
in
fact
there
is
just
a
hint
of
alcohol
mostly
in
the
finish
you
can
feel
and
taste
it
evaporating
after
you
swallow
for
a
spiced
beer
this
is
taste
perfection
the
body
is
of
medium
consistency
while
the
level
of
carbonation
is
on
the
lighter
side
there
is
some
mouth
coating
but
it
is
very
slight
it
is
not
syrupy
or
sticky
as
i
described
above
it
feels
like
it
is
just
a
thin
layer
of
alcohol
the
pleasantly
disappears
this
is
especially
impressive
considering
the
strength
and
style
of
this
beer
this
quality
mouthfeel
lends
itself
to
making
pannepot
incredibly
drinkable
the
spices
never
get
overwhelming
if
you
order
a
glass
of
this
or
pop
open
a
bottle
you
could
sip
it
slowly
for
a
long
time
or
just
as
easily
you
could
order
round
after
round
the
alcohol
never
impedes
the
drinkablity
the
old
fishermans
ale
is
dangerous
that
way
i
would
drink
this
beer
all
the
time
if
it
wasnt
so
rare
and
expensive
its
an
exceptional
product
that
i
can
easily
call
my
favorite
quad
easy
to
sip
this
beer
the
alcohol
does
not
come
across
as
hot
but
provides
a
nice
warming
sensation
deserves
to
be
drank
slowly
with
contemplation
a
great
complex
beer
d
was
leaning
toward
the
4
5
end
but
not
quite
but
only
becuase
of
the
10
abv
other
than
that
this
is
a
musct
have
for
any
ba
330ml
2007
vintage
into
150ml
chimay
chalice
the
cap
removal
is
followed
by
red
wine
aroma
as
the
beer
creeps
out
of
the
bottle
the
pour
results
in
dark
dense
garnet
reddishbrown
fluid
topped
by
abundant
tan
mousse
head
which
slowly
subsides
transforming
itself
into
solid
lacy
cloth
each
swirl
weaves
a
fabric
of
attractive
lacy
coatings
on
the
walls
nose
is
pampered
by
aromas
of
red
wine
over
ripened
dark
sweet
cherries
prunes
rum
soaked
raisins
cocoa
and
soft
spicy
alcohol
flavor
profile
is
leaned
towards
the
sweet
side
chocolaty
sweet
malty
body
embraces
fruity
flavors
of
over
ripened
dark
sweet
cherries
and
prunes
even
grapes
sparingly
powdered
with
pepper
the
fruity
tartness
is
followed
by
gentle
breadcrust
like
bitterness
to
balance
the
malt
the
beer
is
somewhat
vinous
but
never
really
such
although
the
margins
are
perfectly
smoothened
individual
components
act
as
a
symphonic
orchestra
of
harmonious
flavors
excellent
milk
chocolate
coated
dark
fruits
in
a
bottle
the
thick
and
full
bodied
beer
leaving
sweet
sticky
coatings
on
the
lips
is
on
the
edge
of
being
syrupy
but
never
crosses
the
line
initially
prickly
with
transition
to
velvety
smoothness
the
beer
rests
pillowy
soft
on
the
palate
apart
from
somewhat
overdone
sweetness
nothing
prevails
and
nothing
is
subdued
a
puzzling
beer
although
commonly
classified
as
bsda
or
quad
it
is
verging
on
imperial
stout
great
stuff
i
hope
i
can
forget
about
the
other
2005
bottle
i
have
to
see
how
this
quad
holds
up
compared
to
all
the
others
its
doing
great
so
far
and
seems
like
it
has
a
least
another
25
years
of
life
having
this
again
2007
bottle
tonight
the
above
review
was
an
06
if
i
am
remembering
correctly
this
2007
is
dense
and
heavy
like
a
raisin
loaf
great
sipper
gotta
dock
it
a
bit
for
drinkability
though
it
is
hearty
and
quite
filling
drinkability
i
only
wish
i
could
get
this
without
having
to
trade
anyone
like
to
trade
for
this
plenty
of
west
coast
hoppy
ipas
come
on
pours
a
rich
dark
chocolatey
brown
with
modest
head
comprised
off
larger
than
average
bubbles
minimal
retention
but
decent
semisticky
lacing
smell
is
a
wonderous
whiff
off
dark
dried
fruits
cherry
plum
rasisn
fig
backed
by
a
rich
toffee
like
malt
backbone
hints
of
citrus
oak
vanilla
herbs
and
spice
linger
in
the
background
taste
is
an
amazing
blend
of
the
above
mentioned
ingredients
starts
out
with
a
touch
of
sweetness
before
it
dives
head
first
into
dark
fruit
and
toffee
finnishes
with
a
wonderfull
fresh
crusty
bread
taste
and
no
lingering
sticky
or
sweet
flavors
carbonation
is
spot
on
for
an
ale
with
age
on
it
and
as
mentioned
above
no
sense
of
sticky
sweetness
to
the
begining
or
end
a
wonderfull
beer
that
exceeded
all
expectations
and
defies
its
own
style
classification
d
alcohol
shows
up
a
bit
more
as
it
warms
but
is
still
fairly
well
subdued
i
came
into
this
one
skeptical
but
it
came
out
being
quite
the
tasty
beer
mouthfeel
may
be
a
bit
overcarbonated
but
nothing
really
to
complain
about
nice
and
thick
like
sucking
the
nectar
out
of
fruit
drinkability
takes
a
little
hit
for
the
noticeable
10
abv
and
the
thickness
its
sufficiently
filling
one
final
note
the
yeast
cake
on
the
bottle
of
this
bottle
was
massive
ive
been
trying
to
find
these
on
the
east
coast
but
havent
had
much
luck
i
brought
three
of
them
back
with
me
from
its
land
of
origin
sharing
my
last
bottle
with
my
uncle
who
went
to
belgium
with
me
im
definitely
on
the
hunt
for
more
f
finishes
slightly
dry
with
a
slight
lingering
smoke
and
porter
flavor
with
roast
a
slight
syrup
lingering
and
the
raisin
just
hangs
out
for
a
while
too
not
quite
sure
the
alc
content
of
it
but
i
can
only
assume
its
pretty
high
and
hides
it
well
a
very
delicious
beer
and
i
wish
i
had
a
lot
more
of
it
even
my
wife
who
is
not
a
beer
drinker
enjoyed
this
i
think
its
the
first
beer
i
have
shared
with
her
that
she
actually
somewhat
enjoyed
ive
now
seen
this
beer
in
the
area
stl
beer
stores
so
another
bottle
or
two
should
be
in
the
works
for
me
d
a
winner
d
this
is
a
great
beer
and
worthy
of
the
top
100
list
however
the
alcohol
is
a
little
hot
and
im
not
sure
if
more
than
one
of
these
is
in
order
however
i
am
not
having
much
trouble
with
the
one
i
have
j
this
is
a
really
good
beer
the
spice
is
just
makes
everything
a
little
off
for
me
still
even
if
it
is
not
to
my
tastes
exactly
this
is
a
very
worth
while
beer
i
would
recommend
this
note
i
had
a
bottle
of
2007
also
but
it
was
infected
tight
seal
on
the
cap
and
still
carbonated
so
it
wasnt
oxidized
but
it
was
extremely
sour
so
there
must
have
been
a
problem
with
the
yeast
inky
black
with
a
nice
beige
head
aroma
is
sweet
caramel
raisins
taste
is
fantastic
rich
and
well
balanced
sweet
but
not
cloying
smooth
and
tasty
caramel
tamarind
a
hint
of
spice
a
big
satisfying
taste
mouthfeel
is
very
nice
velvety
but
not
heavy
nice
warmth
from
the
alcohol
overall
an
outstanding
beer
a
very
nice
rich
beverage
a
special
treat
that
i
was
happy
to
try
on
tap
2006
dark
brown
with
ruby
highlights
no
head
or
lacing
and
light
carbonation
bubles
rather
dull
looking
very
lovely
aroma
of
brown
sugar
dark
fruits
spices
and
brandy
taste
follows
suit
closely
with
the
nose
big
bready
malts
caramel
brown
sugar
coated
plums
some
raisin
and
a
light
chocolaty
finish
this
is
very
reminiscent
of
a
well
made
doppelbock
only
with
a
yeastier
fruitier
finish
good
stuff
mediumfull
bodied
light
carbonation
tingle
this
is
a
sipper
and
a
very
good
one
at
that
all
i
can
say
is
wow
what
a
great
beer
up
until
a
few
months
ago
this
was
my
number
one
favorite
beer
then
i
got
a
reserva
and
a
grand
reserva
and
lets
just
say
it
does
get
better
than
this
this
beer
has
it
all
the
flavor
is
over
the
top
and
is
definitely
a
better
brew
than
its
counter
part
the
danish
version
but
hey
try
both
but
i
prefer
this
version
for
it
is
a
little
spicier
and
thicker
on
the
palette
which
i
like
nice
vanilla
flavors
with
spices
and
earthy
flavors
abound
a
great
brew
and
a
must
have
pairs
well
with
almondstuffed
olives
gorgonzola
jamón
ibérico
de
bellota
or
even
lobster
bisque
overall
this
was
a
truly
worldclass
quadrupel
that
deserves
its
place
at
the
top
of
the
style
highly
recommended
a
stellar
wellbalanced
brew
poured
from
the
bottle
to
a
dark
brown
with
slight
reddish
tint
and
a
thin
off
white
head
that
klingers
thru
midglass
aroma
is
malty
dark
fruit
with
and
the
mouthfeel
is
like
a
muted
flemish
sour
tangy
at
first
then
slowly
turning
sweet
taste
brings
out
the
dark
fruits
of
the
nose
all
rounding
to
a
long
pleasant
finish
but
for
me
personally
i
could
finish
off
a
22oz
10barleywine
and
couldnt
finish
off
a
12oz
of
this
dt
the
weird
spices
and
mouthfeel
i
recommand
to
try
if
you
have
the
opportunity
this
little
unassuming
bottle
is
packed
with
flavor
i
probably
never
would
have
picked
it
up
if
it
wasnt
so
highly
regarded
on
beer
advocate
thanks
everyone
d
very
very

for
a
10

beer
it
is
just
delicious
again
the
overcarbonation
issues
take
this
down
to
a
4
in
the
drinkability
department
this
is
an
exceptional
beer
nonetheless
is

much
in

i

the

the
pannepot
2011
despite
its
intense
soy
sauce
flavor
but
this
bottle
knocks
it
out
of
the
park
for
me
every
sip
brings
a
wave
of
intense
yet
intricate
flavors
the
sherry
flavors
in
particular
are
very
interesting
and
enjoyable
let
this
warm
up
a
bit
if
you
are
taking
it
out
of
the
fridge
i
will
look
for
more
bottles
of
the
reserva
cant
wait
to
crack
the
grand
reserva
o
age
has
done
wonders
08
is
amazing
but
i
like
the
brighter
yet
still
very
mellow
flavors
of
the
09
better
both
are
some
of
the
best
quads
in
the
world
overall
bam
this
beer
packs
some
enjoyment
factor
for
me
this
beer
so
far
is
my
highlight
of
2014
i
should
go
back
to
maxs
and
get
the
2005
vintage
this
brew
is
delicate
and
still
takes
you
on
a
joy
ride
like
it
stole
your
neighbors
car
belgian
strong
ales
are
one
of
my
favorite
styles
of
beer
and
then
age
it
in
oak
barrels
yes
please
this
brew
is
recommended
dark
ruby
red
to
brown
appearance
the
nose
is
of
sweet
plums
and
cherries
the
taste
is
very
strong
with
dark
malts
figs
plums
dried
cherries
and
a
little
smoke
very
smooth
for
an
old
overall
very
nice
its
definitely
recommended
note
2010
vintage
imbibed
in
2012
snagged
this
bottle
off
a
shelf
at
dawsons
in
severna
park
hiding
behind
some
other
brews
while
home
for
the
holidays
2009
bottle
poured
to
a
unibroue
tulip
on
1914
the
bottle
says
only
3000
bottles
of
this
made
not
a
bad
find
pours
a
murky
dark
brownish
purple
with
a
small
off
white
or
khaki
colored
head
beautiful
aroma
of
plums
super
ripe
pears
raisins
tobacco
toffee
chocolate
brown
sugar
lots
of
beautiful
mellow
oak
with
a
nice
helping
of
booze
that
makes
me
almost
think
this
was
bourbon
barrels
flavor
of
raisins
plums
brown
sugar
some
warming
booze
light
cocoa
toffee
tobacco
and
much
more
spice
than
would
be
expected
from
the
aroma
the
oak
dries
out
the
finish
a
bit
and
keeps
this
a
very
smooth
and
mellow
brew
despite
the
alcohol
and
spice
present
the
mouthfeel
is
heavy
like
huge
imperial
stout
heavy
and
yet
has
low
to
medium
carbonation
this
was
pretty
freaking
awesome
loved
every
sip
of
it
i
asked
urbain
when
he
is
going
to
brew
this
pannepeut
again
because
i
need
a
crate
of
this
beer
i
will
have
to
wait
a
while
i
have
had
both
the
reserva
and
the
regular
releases
for
years
both
are
of
the
same
quality
generally
although
the
reserva
has
some
deep
portlike
flavors
that
have
developed
more
than
the
regular
both
are
world
class
quads
right
up
there
with
the
trappist
offerings
o
decadent
not
what
i
was
expecting
but
damn
tasty
nonetheless
id
heard
this
beer
is
rich
and
estery
and
sweet
appropriate
for
the
time
of
year
this
was
much
drier
and
lighter
for
the
style
a
drinkable
quadrupel
note
2010
vintage
o
fantastic
depth
of
flavors
that
intrigue
and
challenge
you
with
every
sip
bottom
line
world
class
quad
overall
comparable
with
standard
pannepot
but
just
different
enjoyed
this
one
an
excellent
quad
o
a
little
tasty
goes
down
ok
not
too
filling
strong
kick
decent
representation
of
style
its
a
solid
beer
but
there
are
others
in
the
style
that
i
would
pick
first
o
one
of
those
beer
that
i
not
forget
in
a
hurry
pronounced
balanced
flavours
plenty
of
aroma
just
a
little
let
down
by
the
appearance
recommended
m
medium
to
full
bodied
o
rivals
the
great
oakages
imperial
stouts
for
level
of
complexity
and
tastiness
d
not
too
shabby
a
full
bodied
brew
with
a
good
deal
of
flavor
very
complex
the
oak
is
present
and
adds
one
more
dimension
to
regular
pannepot
o
a
touch
of
sweetness
but
a
nice
easy
to
drink
beer
with
lots
of
caramel
and
fruit
o
not
a
cheap
beer
but
a
fantastic
value
8
50
a
bottle
i
may
need
to
get
more
the
best
quad
i
have
had
to
date
simply
fantastic
stuff
if
this
is
the
reserva
whats
the
grand
reserva
taste
like
o
decent
but
pretty
disappointing
the
only
brew
from
de
struise
this
night
that
didnt
wow
me
mayhaps
the
keg
isnt
in
fantastic
shape
this
would
probably
be
better
if
it
were
bottle
conditioned
in
fairness
a
phenomenal
beer
the
flavor
is
so
far
offthecharts
i
need
new
charts
i
suppose
it
feels
just
a
bit
thin
for
all
that
flavor
and
i
hate
to
compare
every
quad
to
those
nice
bottleconditioned
trappist
ales
but
this
one
did
come
off
as
a
tad
undercarbonated
still
if
you
like
quads
and
come
across
this
one
you
must
pick
it
up
expensive
but
definitely
worth
a
try
the
flavor
and
complexity
are
simply
unsurpassed
with
0
abv
this
is
one
of
the
better
quads
but
the
licorice
flavor
is
overwhelming
high
b
o
id
much
prefer
the
base
beer
the
monks
ale
or
the
grand
reserva
though
this
beer
is
very
well
rounded
its
almost
got
a
wild
element
to
it
disappointed
i
admit
overhyped
perhaps
but
enjoyable
and
tasty
oh
yeah
pretty
hot
could
use
some
aging
to
calm
that
down
but
the
flavor
and
aroma
were
more
subtle
than
expected
somewhat
disappointing
overrated
imo
pannepot
reserva
has
a
lot
of
potential
the
oak
flavors
really
add
a
nice
adjustment
to
the
regular
beer
the
problem
is
the
base
beer
seems
weaker
and
less
prominent
i
think
age
is
needed
on
this
a
2010
served
2013
perhaps
a
5
year
gap
between
the
bottle
date
and
tasting
are
needed
here
a
shame
as
i
thought
id
like
this
more
from
the
nose
and
the
first
sip
330
ml
bottle
into
chalice
2009
vintage
pours
murky
dark
reddish
brown
color
with
a
small
khaki
head
with
decent
retention
that
reduces
to
a
thin
lace
cap
that
lingers
minimal
glass
lacing
with
some
light
streaming
carbonation
aromas
of
big
raisin
prune
fig
molasses
toast
clove
pepper
oak
light
roast
brown
bread
and
yeast
earthiness
damn
nice
aromas
with
good
balance
and

with

light

and
earthiness
on
the
finish
for
a
while
fantastic
complexity
and
balance
of
malt
and
fruityspicy
flavors
with
moderate
oak
presence
and
zero
cloying
flavors
after
the
finish
medium
carbonation
and
fairly
full
bodied
with
a
creamy
and
slick
mouthfeel
that
is
great
alcohol
is
very
well
hidden
with
only
a
slight
warming
noticed
after
the
finish
overall
this
is
a
fantastic
oak
aged
quadrupel
big
complexity
and
great
balance
of
flavors
and
quite
smooth
to
sip
on
a
highly
enjoyable
offering
o
a
very
good
oakaged
quad
regular
pannepot
is
solid
and
the
oak
rounds
out
some
of
the
harshness
that
it
can
have
it
could
also
be
rounded
out
due
to
the
age
itself
but
regardless
it
is
a
bit
more
complex
than
the
regular
version
which
is
saying
quite
a
lot
definitely
worthy
of
a
purchase
especially
if
you
can
find
it
for
under
10
a
well
made
beer
thats
easy
to
drink
overall
im
loving
this
one
seems
age
does
this
2009
version
well
im
already
planning
on
finding
more
a
highly
recommended
try
if
you
like
quads
and
dark
ales
overall
this
is
a
great
quad
from
a
great
brewer
i
really
need
to
sample
this
the
original
and
the
grand
reserva
at
the
same
time
because
i
really
cant
recall
a
great
difference
in
flavor
but
a
horizontal
tasting
will
hopefully
alleviate
that
probably
my
favorite
and
decently
available
brewery
of
the
quad
style
the
mouthfeel
is
what
i
love
because
it
has
such
a
creamy
smooth
character
overall
well
its
pannepot
so
its
still
a
great
beer
but
i
guess
im
just
disappointed
that
the
oak
seems
to
have
cut
out
the
great
flavors
instead
of
augmenting
them
perfectly
dark
with
a
half
inch
of
off
white
head
very
nice
retention
and
some
nice
spots
of
lacing
aroma
is
light
cocoa
and
prune
flavor
is
a
kinda
hot
with
a
lot
of
quad
pruney
notes
with
a
touch
of
sherry
the
roasty
cocoa
is
a
nice
counterpoint
to
the
quad
character
i
dont
get
a
ton
of
oak
perhaps
a
touch
of
vanilla
in
the
aftertaste
but
not
a
huge
barrel
character
from
the
oak
mid
level
carbonation
with
a
bit
of
a
bite
maybe
could
up
the
body
a
bit
this
was
delectable
pannepot
is
such
a
great
beer
and
throwing
it
into
a
barrel
is
divine
from
notes
12411
excellent
beer
pours
dark
brown
with
a
smallish
beige
head
combines
pannepots
huge
fruity
malty
flavors
with
drying
oak
overtones
raisins
plums
prunes
figs
dates
molasses
caramel
spice
sherry
and
wood
the
taste
is
fairly
sweet
but
ends
with
a
dry
oak
flavor
lush
mouthfeel
that
again
mostly
dries
out
in
the
end
just
makes
me
hunger
all
the
more
for
the
grande
reserva
edit
i
later
tried
this
beer
against
the
gr
and
while
my
scores
for
this
beer
dropped
slightly
i
definitely
preferred
it
to
the
gr
which
was
a
bit
disappointing
o
for
me
this
is
what
a
quad
should
be
like
except
that
i
would
prefer
a
little
more
complexity
on
the
nose
and
more
duration
on
the
flavor
i
think
a
younger
bottle
would
solve
this
as
well
as
the
oxidation
issue
overall
though
still
a
great
experience
i
finally
broke
down
and
opened
this
2008dated
bottle
that
i
had
stashed
inside
my
kegerator
for
around
three
years
it
pours
from
the
bottle
with
a
warm
chestnut
brown
color
that
is
light
enough
that
the
many
floating
specks
of
sediment
are
easily
identified
a
big
foamy
beige
head
helps
to
redeem
the
appearance
though
the
aroma
is
sadly
a
bit
muted
but
it
does
convey
some
nice
notes
of
dark
brown
sugar
and
dried
grains
the
flavor
is
certainly
more
assertive
with
moderately
rich
dry
toffeelike
sweetness
some
mild
floral
and
dried
herb
characteristics
and
some
slightly
tangy
yeast
the
medium
body
and
light
fine
carbonation
do
a
very
nice
job
lightening
the
profile
without
taking
away
substance
overall
this
isnt
a
standard
setter
for
a
belgian
quad
and
lacks
the
same
dry
fruity
depth
of
the
best
in
this
class
but
it
is
mouthpleasing
and
quite
a
bit
more
drinkable
than
its
10
abv
would
suggest
o
great
beer
the
time
in
the
barrel
allows
the
flavors
to
mellow
out
and
blend
together
better
than
they
do
in
regular
pannepot
o
good
stuff
a
nearly
5yearold
beer
that
has
held
its
carbonation
quite
well
its
a
tad
bit
more
sugary
than
i
would
like
in
order
to
give
it
a
5
in
the
taste
category
but
its
certainly
deserving
of
just
one
notch
lower
overall
this
beer
is
about
what
you
would
expect
if
you
are
familiar
with
the
style
a
bit
smoother
than
most
this
being
from
2008
helps
that
a
bit
i
would
imagine
in
the
genre
as
with
most
quads
and
bsdas
i
can
appreciate
the
complexity
of
the
taste
and
can
enjoy
it
as
a
slow
sipper
but
i
just
cant
find
that
flavor
note
that
makes
me
really
fall
in
love
with
it
the
way
i
do
a
great
ipa
or
is
then
again
i
paid
9
for
11
2
ounces
of
this
so
maybe
its
for
the
best
the
dark
fruits
are
a
little
too
big
and
tangy
for
my
tastes
i
prefer
more
of
the
deep
malt
flavors
what
a
nice
treat
i
can
count
on
one
hand
the
number
of
quads
ive
tried
and
this
one
crushes
all
of
them
i
may
need
to
look
further
into
this
style
this
is
a
great
belgium
take
overall
it
does
have
some
oak
in
the
flavor
along
with
good
doses
of
dates
raisins
and
figs
mix
in
a
touch
of
caramel
and
some
hints
of
rummy
brown
bread
and
molasses
next
it
also
has
light
touches
of
roasty
bitterness
a
tasty
wellmade
brew
thnx
thijs
prosit
highly
recommended
this
brew
flies
sooo
far
under
the
radar
its
not
funny
amazing
quad
overall
a
solid
quad
that
hits
all
the
right
notes
while
i
enjoyed
this
beer
i
feel
thre
are
more
complex
quads
out
there
to
be
had
for
cheaper
or
the
same
price
the
chocolate
male
is
just
too
dominating
overall
a
damn
good
quad
i
like
the
oak
but
im
not
sure
its
any
better
than
the
regular
pannepot
09
vintage
totally
not
worth
the
hype
pours
a
clear
caramel
color
with
a
red
trace
and
a
minimal
white
head
that
fades
to
nothing
in
seconds
the
smell
is
just
fine
sweet
residual
sugars
from
a
big
ass
malt
profile
a
touch
of
molasses
and
plento
of
booze
the
flavor
is
a
letdown
to
me
though
it
has
none
of
the
complexity
im
accustomed
to
in
a
quad
nothing
woody
about
this
nothing
spirited
and
clever
in
the
malts
used
and
just
way
too
much
sugar
and
booze
this
is
not
an
elegant
beer
the
mouthfeel
is
flat
and
watered
down
made
caustic
from
the
alcohol
which
should
have
mellowed
out
by
now
sticky
sweet
feeling
left
after
the
last
sip
a
funny
buzz
and
a
turning
tummy
this
isnt
anywhere
near
one
of
the
best
quads
ive
had
good
beer
by
other
standards
maybe
or
maybe
my
bottle
was
bunk
but
this
was
a
huge
letdown
for
me
oi
think
every
sip
i
take
i
taste
something
new
and
different
this
beer
is
too
complex
to
accurately
review
so
much
is
happening
so
much
is
going
on
its
so
drinkable
im
not
sure
where
the
10
is
because
i
cant
taste
it
in
this
quad
simply
put
best
quad
ive
ever
had
o
solid
once
again
like
the
base
beer
and
the
barrel
aging
worked
its
magic
this
is
medium
bodied
with
smooth
carbonation
this
is
a
real
treat
i
like
pannepot
alright
but
this
is
definitely
a
step
up
overall
a
great
beer
i
really
like
what
the
oak
did
to
this
beer
now
i
just
need
to
try
the
normal
version
my
second
beer
from
this
brewery
and
again
this
is
very
good
i
will
look
out
for
more
of
their
beers
pretty
fun
drink
quite
mellow
no
heat
on
this
at
all
either
fun
beer
from
these
guys
perhaps
not
a
fav
style
but
ill
take
it
i
love
quads
i
wouldnt
put
this
at
the
top
of
my
list
but
its
definitely
quite
good
strong
dark
fruit
flavors
complemented
well
by
some
those
dark
leafy
flavors
and
just
like
that
my
glass
is
nearly
empty
which
makes
me
sad
the
beer
is
chestnut
brown
with
a
thin
beige
collar
the
aroma
offers
dark
malts
brown
sugar
raisins
smells
nice
great
flavor
and
remarkably
easy
to
drink
alcohol
hidden
very
well
a
tad
sweet
with
lingering
notes
of
plums
figs
another
great
beer
from
de
struise
4
5
d
the
taste
was
between
a
4
0
and
a
4
5
so
ill
make
up
the
difference
here
very
good
beer
and
probably
the
best
variant
the
grand
reserva
covers
up
too
many
flavors
for
me
to
prefer
that
o
of
the
three
this
was
my
second
favorite
the
oak
character
adds
a
lot
to
this
beer
and
i
think
it
is
very
well
balanced
and
smooth
with
so
much
complexity
built
into
the
beer
its
an
absolute
delight
to
the
taste
buds
as
it
will
make
a
fine
complement
to
any
dinner
in
place
of
that
port
wine
or
cognac
for
comparisons
sake
theres
just
a
few
nuances
that
keeps
it
from
competing
with
rochefort
10
quite
a
beer
quite
a

not

o

lacking
the

of
the
great

in

to
the
regular
pannepot
of
which
i
drank
a
2011
id
say
that
one
was
better
the
booze
and
heat
mellowed
in
this
one
likely
more
due
to
the
age
than
the
barrel
treatment
but
unfortunately
the
quanitity
of
aroma
and
flavor
has
also
mellowed
plus
little
of
the
oak
character
came
out
in
this
brew
definitely
worth
a
drink

not

original
review
on
09142010
o
i
really
liked
this
a
lot
maybe
a
tad
bit
too
sweet
for
me
but
well
balanced
savory
and
complex
oak
aging
really
added
to
this
beer
very
smooth
and
lighter
than
expected
still
chewy
but
not
quite
as
heavy
as
some
other
quads
lots
of
complexity
easy
to
drink
and
very
hidden
alcohol
such
a
beautiful
beer
i
may
perfer
this
to
westy
o
3
5
i
quite
like
this
there
are
some
weird
things
going
on
but
they
all
work
together
o
pretty
much
you
would
expect
tastes
like
normal
pannepot
with
some
oak
aspects
added
in
this
is
a
little
older
vintage
than
my
regular
pannepot
and
the
flavors
seem
to
have
melded
a
bit
making
it
a
bit
smoother
a
good
quad
either
way
very
complex
and
intricate
buy
any
pannepot
you
find
o
this
beer
is
incredible
its
very
complex
yet
easy
to
drink
there
is
no
hint
of
abv
its
fairly
dry
for
a
quad
but
is
packed
with
toffee
and
dark
fruit
flavor
well
worth
seeking
out
it
looks
the
same
as
the
grand
reserva
but
with
a
better
head
the
smell
is
much
less
roasty
and
lacks
some
of
the
mellowed
characteristics
i
loved
on
the
05
gr
very
belgian
sweet
sugary
malty
moving
to
the
taste
this
is
balanced
and
light
the
taste
is
more
focused
on
dark
fruits
candied
sugar
and
belgian
yeasts
while
it
is
balanced
it
might
need
some
age
slight
harsh
boozy
finish
medium
body
low
carbonation
pretty
damn
drinkable
this
was
very
good
should
have
had
it
before
the
grand
reserva
its
just
not
as
good
o
very
good
quad
perfect
as
a
winter
warmer
lucky
to
come
across
this
and
will
have
to
pick
up
some
more
if
you
want
a
reason
to
get
this
beer
then
i
would
say
to
utilize
it
the
same
way
you
would
a
big
bold
red
wine
a
steak
a
broiled
pork
chop
it
would
suit
these
things
perfectly
0
another
classic
entry
in
the
pannepot
series
keep
em
coming
overall
this
beer
impressed
me
it
was
a
good
elaboration
on
more
traditional
quadruples
that
i
have
had
i
will
be
returning
to
the
store
to
by
some
more
to
age
o
this
is
a
very
good
quad
o
a
solid
quad
with
nothing
left
to
be
desired
but
nothing
insanely
great
about
it
from
51212
the
2009
is
on
tap
at
maxs
today
its
every
bit
as
good
consitent
high
quality
from
this
excellent
brewer
that
said
this
is
tremendously
drinkable
and
i
highly
recommend
it
to
any
who
can
get
their
hands
on
one
cheers
d
this
is
a
very
good
beer
especially
in
terms
of
flavor
but
it
could
definitely
use
some
improvement
in
terms
of
mouthfeel
the
alcohol
comes
through
to
a
significant
extent
and
makes
this
one
a
bit
of
a
sipper
o
the
nose
was
great
it
was
very
easy
drinking
but
i
expected
a
little
more
in
the
taste
honestly
this
is
a
great
quad
and
i
believe
the
age
has
helped
not
the
strongest
quad
at
10
but
the
booze
is
definitely
in
the
background
and
if
this
were
fresh
i
could
see
it
being
harsh
highly
recommended
will
pick
up
another
aged
bottle
if
i
see
this
on
shelves
this
is
a
great
quad
very
complex
not
over
the
top
nice
complementary
oak
well
balanced
hope
to
get
my
hands
on
another
vintage
of
this
beer
o
a
pretty
good
beer
just
wish
the
flavor
profile
lived
up
to
the
aroma
age
could
have
played
a
factor
with
that
one
d
another
variation
of
pannepot
and
another
winner
so
easy
to
sip
despite
packing
a
big
punch
alcohol
only
revealed
in
the
rum
note
and
lightly
warming
aftertaste
otherwise
expertly
masked
a
cracker
o
the
best
quad
ive
had
one
of
the
best
belgian
quads
out
there
not
sure
if
i
appreciate
the
oak
age
as
much
because
the
regular
pannepot
and
even
pannepeut
is
just
as
good
when
aged
if
you
consider
yourself
a
fan
of
belgian
quads
and
have
not
had
this
one
yet
then
youre
not
complete
yet
i
dont
like
quads
usually
but
this
is
excellent
most
belgians
are
overpowered
by
the
yeast
but
this
has
great
balance
of
flavors
as
good
as
this
is
i
had
a
regular
pannepot
of
similar
age
and
i
thought
it
was
slightly
better
this
is
still
a
great
beer
overall
i
have
had
a
few
quadruples
but
not
many
this
was
definitely
enjoyable
and
easy
to
drink
this
belgian
quad
has
been
aged
on
oak
but
the
oak
doesnt
overpower
the
beer
the
flavors
work
wonderfully
with
each
other
and
this
2008
vintage
has
aged
exceptionally
well
i
wish
i
had
more
than
one
bottle
of
this
vintage
o
fantastic
quite
a
treat
very
well
put
together
and
for
10
abv
quite
easy
to
drink
alcohol
is
very
faint
which
is
surprising
nice
spice
notes
and
a
classic
belgian
quad
flavor
will
definitely
drink
again
o
id
been
wanting
to
try
this
one
for
a
while
and
it
definitely
didnt
disappoint
im
usually
not
a
big
fan
of
quads
but
this
was
no
quad
this
was
candy
pannepot
reserva
pours
a
dark
brown
color
with
a
thin
cocoa
head
in
my
snifter
glass
good
lacing
on
this
beer
the
nose
is
oak
bourbon
vanilla
and
dark
fruit
really
nice
the
taste
is
the
same
as
the
nose
with
a
little
coffee
added
in
the
feel
is
out
of
this
world
super
smooth
velvety
and
amazing
ive
never
had
a
big
beer
that
goes
down
this
easily
and
is
this
amazing
feel
wise
overall
highly
recommended
you
try
this
if
you
have
a
chance
taste
vert
fresh
i
would
think
some
time
could
really
mellow
this
out
ill
have
to
maybe
buy
another
usually
when
a
quad
is
very
sweet
it
leaves
a
sugar
coating
in
your
mouth
but
the
age
has
really
mellowed
out
and
left
the
remnants
of
caramelized
sugars
i
like
it
alot
more
than
the
fruity
overly
sweet
quads
overall
a
very
tasty
brew
a
bit
one
demensional
with
tastes
being
on
the
sweet
side
also
kind
of
an
ugly
duckling
one
of
the
greats
dark
dark
brown
almost
black
with
a
tan
head
nose
is
dark
fruit
mainly
plum
to
me
spice
caramel
and
charred
wood
lots
of
layers
but
humble
at
the
same
time
taste
follows
suit
with
some
added
vanilla
and
grain
tastes
and
i
find
almost
a
smoky
hint
in
the
end
and
chocolate
pretty
sweet
but
not
cloying
almost
full
body
with
a
rustic
kind
of
feel
very
very
good
its
better
than
westy
12
by
a
long
shot
o
had
pannepot
last
night
and
thought
it
was
great
i
think
the
reserva
is
probably
a
touch
better
both
are
excellent
quads
very
smooth

refined

imho
o

indeed
with
just
great
tastes
all
rolled
up
together
has
a
nice
sweetness
and
makes
a
great
sipper
o
this
is
one
of
my
favorite
quads
it
is
also
one
of
the
best
barrelaged
beers
ive
tried
this
is
one
not
to
miss
pours
an
opaque
very
dark
amber
some

and
medium
colored
khaki
foam
with
some
big
bubbles
and
a
ring
of

like
green
apple
dark

and
some
bright
caramel
as
it
warms
dark

barrel
spices
and
some

taste
is

apple
subdued
caramel
malt
and
a
hint
of
chocolate
medium
body
and
light
carbonation
doesnt
show
the
alcohol
at
all
overall
a
pretty
tasty
quad
balance
with
barrel
characteristics
which
support
the
other
flavors
well
nice
job
o
very
enjoyable
quad
from
struise
there
is
some
apparent
alcohol
but
it
is
not
detracting
in
the
least
it
really
works
well
with
the
fruits
and
spices
poured

a

id
like
but
still
fairly

a

lingering

and
a
bit
of

excellent
quad
and
something
i
could
keep
my
nose
to
for
hours
flavour
holds
up
quite
well
to
the
nose
on
this
as
well
overall
definitely
one
of
the
best
and
most
complex
of
the
style
ive
ever
had
certainly
a
great
beer
i
really
like
how
much
heat
is
present
at
this
age
too
looking
forward
to
my
other
bottle
yum
i
love
pannepot
in
all
its
forms
but
there
have
been
times
when
it
didnt
live
up
to
my
fond
memories
this
was
not
one
of
those
times
this
is
an
expertly
made
and
deliriously
delicious
beer
after
now
sampling
pannepot
pannepot
reserva
and
pannepot
grand
reserva
i
can
say
that
there
is
not
much
difference
between
the
three
variations
these
are
all
solid
beers
but
they
lacked
the
intensity
and
complexity
i
was
anticipating
man
alive
this
is
one
complex
and
satisfying
beer
another
incredible
belgian
delight
definitely
a
firstrate
beer
the
effect
of
the
barrels
is
very
nice
though
certainly
not
as
pronounced
as
in
the
grand
reserva
where
they
really
play
a
starring
role
a
classic
cheers
overall
once
more
a
world
class
brew
from
de
struise
i
would
suggest
drinking
a
fresh
one
and
cellaring
as
much
as
you
can
as
this
beer
ages
very
very
well
as
does
all
pannepot
seemingly
pours
a
dark
brown
almost
black
color
with
a
paper
thin
head
with
great
lacing
for
a
quad
aroma
of
caramel
figs
and
raisins
tastes
sweet
and
fruity
oak
notes
in
the
back
thick
and
chewy
yet
easy
to
drink
not
too
boozy
the
aging
has
done
this
beer
some
good
o
this
one
is
very
enjoyable
but
a
bit
on
the
raisin
side
for
me
sweet
and
viscous
too
much
caramel
and
sweetness
pours
a
deep
amber
to
brown
in
color
with
a
light
tan
head
in
the
aroma
oaky
and
dark
fruit
in
the
taste
dark
fruits
a
mellow
oaky
taste
and
just
a
pinch
of
alcohol
a
small
alcohol
bite
and
a
medium
bodied
mouthfeel
with
a
dry
oak
and
small
alcohol
like
aftertaste
a
nice
oak
presence
with
a
dark
fruit
sweet
to
dryness
a
really
nice
sipper
the
mouthfeel
is
on
the
heavier
side
with
carbonation
being
above
average
overall
it
was
a
great
beer
the
oak
and
dark
fruits
mixed
very
well
for
me
it
was
relatively
balanced
as
well
for
the
style
with
the
yeast
spice
and
malty
sweetness
kept
in
check
very
enjoyable
beer
overall

second

was

my

still
not
as
good
as
this
beer
could
or
should
be
overall
what
can
you
say
about
de
struise
they
make
some
of
the
best
beers
in
the
world
pannepot
reserva
while
not
completely
mind
blowing
is
an
excellent
excellent
beer
this
is
an
interesting
complex
beer
it
is
moderately
strong
in
alcohol
and
makes
a
good
evening
digestif
o
an
interesting
take
on
the
old
fishermans
ale
not
sure
how
i
feel
about
it
compared
to
the
standard
pannepot
its
certainly
different
and
unique
its
very
delicious
and
the
mouth
feel
is
amazing
de
struisse
can
make
some
pretty
amazing
quads
the
oak
is
not
pronounced
in
oakiness
or
vanilla
in
this
beer
though
if
it
were
more
oaky
in
its
nature
i
think
i
would
appreciate
the
oak
aging
more
personally
reviewed
on
05032010
medium
feel
with
a
modest
level
of
carbonation
this
brew
is
super
drinkable
for
10
with
an
alcohol
presence
that
increases
with
the
warmth
of
the
beers
temperature
along
with
the
increase
in
temperature
comes
a
bit
of
a
more
grainy
sweetness
instead
of
candy
but
it
still
has
a
caramel
quality
about
it
which
is
very
enjoyable
d
split
the
bottle
three
ways
and
it
was
easy
to
finish
this
bad
boy
i
like
this
better
than
the
recent
vintages
but
im
not
sure
its
a
big
improvement
over
the
other
pannepot
variants
still
well
worth
trying
overall
a
good
quad
but
there
is
a
heavy
metallic
taste
i
just
cant
get
past
i
have
a
couple
other
vintages
i
will
rerate
when
i
try
them
odquite
a
delicious
brew
very
impressed
complexity
is
astonishing
smooth
as
smooth
can
be
thin
and
light
body
with
some
decent
soft
carbonation
but
a
little

ive
thought
the
few
that
ive
had

this

strikes
a

drinks
very

o
good
beer
just
like
pannepot
was
id
actually
prefer
to
drink
this
one
more
as
it
was
smoother
but
they
were
both
winners
o
every
now
and
again
you
drink
a
beer
that
is
in
a
space
of
its
own
for
the
style
a
beer
that
you
feel
ultimately
exemplifies
everything
that
you
love
and
look
for
in
a
beer
of
that
style
and
for
a
style
that
i
adore
this
beer
stands
at
the
top
of
the
mountain
with
few
others
even
in
the
same
ballpark
extremely
glad
to
have
2
more
bottles
of
this
exact
vintage
my
hats
off
to
you
de
struise
my
hats
off
to
you
t
im
not
a
huge
fan
of
beers
that
pick
up
too
much
oak
flavor
from
the
barrel
and
luckily
for
me
this
one
doesnt
the
oak
is
there
but
restrained
along
with
some
brown
sugar
dark
fruit
yeast
and
a
nice
spiciness
o
this
beer
has
some
nice
flavor
with
a
subtle
complexity
and
a
soft
woody
note
there
is
a
nice
full
sweetness
but
a
little
more
alcohol
to
cut
it
would
be
nice
there
are
very
faint
notes
of
brett
and
yeast
character
that
would
be
nice
to
taste
more
of
but
they
just
didnt
come
through
mouthfeel
is
very
smooth
as
much
carbonation
is
found
visually
there
is
none
to
be
found
on
the
palate
its
like
drinking
a
light
syrup
such
a
silky
smooth
feel
really
glad
to
have
finally
found
and
tried
this
beer
after
so
long
one
of
the
best
drinking
aged
beers
ive
tried
thoroughly
delicious
o
this
is
such
a
good
complex
and
delicious
quadsuch
nice
spice
and
bready
toasty
malts
make
this
another
damn
good
beer
from
de
struise
mouthfeel
is
light
sour
tingling
and
smooth
is
there
10
in
this
brew
amazing
michael
thick
body
and
perfect
carbonation
not
a
whole
lot
missing
here
for
a
quad
if
anything
2008
riserva
pours
an
oddly
quick
carbonated
head
that
disappearsquicker
than
it
came
the
color
is
a
cola
brown
the
color
along
with
the
head
was
very
reminiscient
of
pouring
a
can
of
soda
in
a
glass
a
fleeting
foamy
head
that
leaves
no
trace
nose
brings
fishermans
friend
cough
drops
smoky
caramel
and
i
am
beginning
to
be
concerned
i
have
an
off
bottle
very
disappointing
so
far
a
slight
prune
taste
with
simple
caramel
oak
and
a
hint
of
vanilla
there
is
literally
no
carbonation
and
everything
is
muted
and
muddled
i
really
hope
this
bottle
is
just
off
and
will
rereview
when
i
open
a
new
one
pours
a
murky
dark
brown
with
a
2
inch
tan
head
that
fades
to
a
small
cap
super
thin
rings
of
lacing
line
the
glass
on
the
drink
down
smells
of
caramel
malts
with
muted
whiffs
of
dark
fruits
especially
raisins
at
first
however
as
the
beer
warms
there
is
a
very
nice
smell
of
raisin
puree
taste
is
of
raisins
and
prunes
brown
sugar
caramel
and
malt
mouthfeel
is
medium
bodied
with
a
good
level
of
carbonation
very
smooth
and
easy
to
drink
overall
this
is
a
very
good
quad
from
struise
if
this
was
brewed
in
2007
that
potentially
makes
it
4
years
old
at
this
point
time
has
treated
this
beer
very
good
d
very
good
beer
here
and
one
i
will
certainly
seek
out
again
its
been
a
while
since
i
had
the
regular
pannepot
so
i
believe
a
side
by
side
is
in
order
o
incredibly
drinkable
and
there
are
hints
of
brandy
as
it
warms
finished
5
of
10
now
that
ive
had
a
three
year
old
version
id
like
to
try
this
freshthis
is
still
a
sipper
a
lot
of
heat
in
the
nose
and
the
taste
even
now
and
id
like
to
know
exactly
what
time
has
done
to
this
it
made
me
think
of
how
much
i
still
have
to
learn
about
beer
and
how
pleasurable
that
process
will
be
really
nice
certainly
better
than
my
other
experience
with
the
regular
pannepot
maybe
that
was
a
lame
bottle

deep
crimson
with
some
expected
floaties
light
carbonation
and
a
thin
cap
of
light
tan
head
that
retains
throughout
and
leaves
some
lacing
smells
malty
with
fermented
dark
sugars
raisins
plums
cherries
blueblackberries
spicyphenolic
yeast
and
some
fruity
alcohol
tastes
of
spice
sweet
citrus
raisins
and
prunes
dates
and
chalky
yeast
a
little
sweet
with
some
bitterness
underneath
and
a
light
winey
character
that
wants
to
contribute
oak
but
cant
quite
push
it
through
it
is
very
thick
and
viscous
with
low
carbonation
and
a
mild
tannic
dryness
as
it
warms
it
lightens
and
the
carbonation
increases
which
is
odd
not
terribly
complex
but
very
tasty
with
a
pleasant
but
restrained
oak
flavor
quite
an
enjoyable
brew
that
is
very
easy
to
drink
wellworth
picking
up
two
of
these
one
for
drinking
and
one
for
aging
good
feel
to
this
full
body
with
soft
carbonation
overall
a
nice
quad
id
love
to
have
this
more
available
overall
one
of
the
best
quads
out
there
definitely
worth
a
try
taste
great
with
tilsit
cheese
o
overall
an
enjoyable
quad
i
guess
i
should
try
the
other
pannepots
too
o
fantastic
stuff
highly
drinkable
despite
the
abv
this
is
a
triumph
why
arent
more
quads
this
interesting
my
all
time
favorite
belgian
beer
i
know
those
are
strong
words
but
this
quad
is
the
strongest
of
contenders
pricey
but
worth
every
penny
has
improved
with
age
as
well
glad
i
waited
an
extra
6
months
after
purchase
to
review
it
atmosphere
is
profound
appearance
is
nothing
transcendental
but
a
deep
and
dark
hue
with
a
nice
enough
head
nose
has
a
lot
going
on
sweet
and
bitter
notes
with
a
robust
malty
base
flavor
is
a
great
combination
of
sweet
spices
robust
malt
and
a
bitter
counterbalance
thick
and
dry
overall
this
is
a
great
quaff
o
i
really
enjoyed
this
beer
and
will
drink
more
of
this
thanks
again
eric
o
not
bad
not
nearly
worth
the
money
paid
for
it
id
much
rather
have
a
weyerbacher
blasphemy
or
something
similar
none
the
less
its
a
solid

world

i

in
years
and
i
am
not
sure
why
now
have
to
soon
revisit
do
try
i
expected
just
a
little
more
out
of
this
still
decent
and
very
different
from
a
lot
of
the
quads
ive
had
i
have
more
bottles
of
this
vintage
but
i
think
id
want
to
try
this
more
fresh
im
guessing
this
was
aged
in
wine
barrels
as
it
states
on
the
bottle
barrels
from
france
and
there
is
a
pronounced
grape
aroma
and
flavor
p
s
do
yourself
a
favor
as
with
all
high
gravity
beers
you
will
do
well
to
drink
this
beer
fairly
warm
overall
this
is
one
of
the
finest
4
quads
in
the
world
perhaps
the
best
of
them
a
touch
less
complex
than
w12
a
bit
less
thick
than
r10
almost
like
stbs
more
talented
and
mature
brother
i
cannot
recommend
it
highly
enough
but
thats
me
i
think
i
prefer
this
version
over
the
regular
shame
its
much
harder
to
find

poured
a
deep
reddish
brown
with
a
half
finger
light
tan
head
that
subsided
to
a
minimal
amount
slowly
maintained
phenomenal
lacing
throughout
the
glass
the
aroma
was
comprised
of
sweet
malt
dark
chocolate
dark
fruit
and
sweet
alcohol
the
flavor
was
of
sweet
malt
dark
chocolate
bread
raisins
and
sweet
alcohol
on
the
followthrough
it
had
a
heavy
feel
on
the
palate
with
mild
carbonation
overall
this
was
a
pretty
good
brew
this
one
wasnt
quite
as
smooth
as
the
old
fishermans
ale
with
similar
age
on
it
but
was
still
quite
nice
the
alcohol
on
this
one
definitely
made
itself
present
on
the
followthrough
without
doubt
hard
to
believe
that
with
this
one
having
4
years
on
it
already
definitely
worth
trying
if
you
get
the
chance
an
absolutely
fantastic
bsda
love
the
effects
of
oak
aging
to
add
an
additional
layer
of
complexity
quite
a
treat
opretty
nice
not
my
favorite
quad
and
i
dont
know
that
i
taste
too
much
of
the
barrel
aging
would
be
interested
to
know
what
was
aged
in
the
barrels
before
this
beer
or
if
they
were
new
barrels
interesting
and
glad
that
i
got
to
try
it
but
wont
be
buying
it
again
for
the
price
of
it
serving
type
bottle
overall
a
great
quad
i
am
a
fan
medium
bodied
not
too
full
not
overcarbed
very
restrained
but
also
very
good
a
great
brew
and
would
recomend
to
anyone
who
enjoys
quads
and
old
ales

well
with
some
nice

finishes
with
a
bit

and
more
dark

carbonation
is
a
bit
lacking
for
this
style
imo
but
still
very
nice
and
drinkable
overall
its
a
very
good
beer
but
i
dont
know
if
id
prefer
it
to
rochefort

or
st
bernardus
12
o
no
hint
as
to
the
style
off
the
bottle
just
aged
i
think
its
a
good
tripple
maybe
a
quad
nice
overall
but
maybe
aged
a
little
long
drink
one
of
the
best
quads
i
have
had
it
was
well
rounded
not
over
bearing
assertive
when
it
needed
to
be
but
yet
delicate
with
the
profile
would
like
to
have
a
few
more
vintages
overall
pannepot
reserva
is
one
of
the
finest
quads
ive
ever
had
i
still
like
the
standard
pannepot
more
though
the
spice
profile
in
standard
pannepot
is
missed
in
this
beer
what
reserva
does
so
well
however
is
to
achieve
a
smoothness
and
subtlety
that
few
other
brewers
could
reproduce
quads
are
usually
reserved
for
the
dessert
portion
of
a
meal
but
pannepot
reserva
is
subtle
enough
yet
still
complex
to
pair
with
duck
or
wild
game
dont
hesitate
to
buy
this
incredible
beer
if
you
find
it
on
store
shelves
mouthfeel
there
are
cheaper
and
more
readily
available
quads
out
there
for
regular
drinking
but
by
itself
this
was
a
good
beverage
very
complex
on
the
palate
a
sipper
i
am
glad
i
tried
this
very
good
quad
worth
seeking
out
if
you
can
get
a
hold
of
it
d
this
is
an
absolute
fabulous
quad
very
delectable
and
one
of
my
overall
favorites
i
just
want
to
hold
it
like
a
good
sherry
so
i
can
inhale
between
sips
mouthfeel
is
wonderfully
well
executed
being
smooth
and
creamy
with
a
slightly
tart
feel
to
it
too
overall
im
really
loving
this
beer
a
bit
different
than
some
other
quads
but
quite
delicious
d
it
goes
down
easily
for
a
big
beer
but
hard
to
imagine
drinking
several
of
these
quads
are
pretty
extravagant
i
find
this
ones
on
the
restrained
end
d
very
high
with
this
beer
a
great
drinking
quad
thats
hard
to
put
down
a
little
pricey
for
a
11
5ml
bottle
about
8
bucks
here
in
oregon
but
worth
it
from
time
to
time

good
quad
but
lacks
the
umph
i
think
my
bottle
was
an
06
or
08
or
something
im
gonna
need
one
of
these
fresh
as
i
doubt
they
get
that
much
better
with
age
the
abv
is
perfect
but
the
flavors
are
dying
mouth
is
nice
and
smooth
drinks
great
for
a
great
big
quad
ive
sipped
so
many
good
beers
over
the
years
since
that
chimay
in
98
its
crazy
this
is
even
my
first
review
but
being
in
philly
it
makes
sense
this
really
is
a
beer
city
i
would
definitely
take
my
time
with
this
it
almost
seems
to
good
to
be
true
until
you
get
to
the
end
and
you
go
wtf
that
was
a
good
brew
d
i
happen
to
not
enjoy
the
spice
cabinet
things
going
on
in
this
beer
so
it
severely
hampers
its
drinkability
for
me
i
do
keep
coming
back
for
the
wonderful
mouthfeel
its
so
damn
creamy

wish
i
had
bought
2
instead
of
1
drinkability
bring
it
on
at
10
its
super
smooth
and
dangerous
if
your
not
careful
though
i
prefer
the
regular
version
over
this
it
still
stands
out
as
another
fine
offering
from
a
great
brewery
update
i
tasted
a
third
bottle
on
31411
sans
any
oxidation
which
was
seriously
out
of
this
world
for
a
quad
i
have
heard
of
some
reports
of
oxidation
but
i
would
tell
you
to
definitely
take
the
chance
im
going
to
update
my
score
on
taste
from
a
4
to
a
4
5
this
was
one
of
the
best
beers
that
i
have
had
so
far
i
could
drink
quite
a
few
of
these
if
i
could
get
more
of
this
blown
away
by
this
one
compared
to
the
2006
vintage
regular
pannepot
the
2007
reserva
is
clearly
better
in
the
looks
department
the
reserva
was
darker
and
the
head
formed
with
a
creamy
goodness
as
the
beer
poured
the
nose
is
a
tad
bolder
for
the
reserva
taste
was
also
bolder
and
sweeter
yet
with
lower
perceived
alcholic
phenols
which
were
masterfully
blended
with
the
dark
fruits
and
molasses
making
it
extremely
delectable
the
thickness
this
time
was
done
right
as
well
though
not
yet
perfect
now
this
is
setting
a
pretty
high
standard
for
the
grand
reserva
that
will
come
next
in
my
horizontal
tasting
journey

reminding

medium

is
fully
appropriate
and
strong

is
mostly
unnoticed
except
for
the
nice
buzz
this
isnt
an
earth
shattering
beer
but
i
found
it
near
perfect
for
the
style
paired
wonderfully
with
18month

my
only
regret
was
not
buying
more
than
one

finish
this

had
me
begging
for
more
m
medium

chewy
drinkability
was
so
so
i
had
high
expectations
for
this
beer
after
trying
the
regular
pannepot
but
that
was
an
2007
i
still
have
one
to
age
so
if
it
gets
better
after
a
year
or
2
i
will
change
my
ratings
d
this
is
pretty
drinkable
but
i
expected
more
out
of
this
beer
in
the
future
i
will
stick
with
the
regular
pannepot
or
spring
for
a
grand
reserva
both
of
which
i
enjoyed
more
than
this
version
highly
drinkable
quad
not
much
alcohol
heat
really
nice
smooth
beer
overall
an
excellent
old
alequad
one
of
the
best
tasted
to
date
2008
deep
toffee
colour
with
a
tan
cap
of
fine
bubbles
nice
lacing
decent
head
retention
great
aroma
bready
and
toasty
malts
earthy
prunes
raisins
almost
a
spicy
wood
character
light
alcohol
nice
flavour
too
a
little
sugary
but
far
from
cloying
caramel
and
molasses
with
more
of
a
fresh
plum
fruitiness
and
less
of
a
prune
and
fig
dried
fruit
character
honey
spices
and
alcohol
were
all
mild
and
balanced
as
was
a
hint
of
oak
flavour
and
astringency
medium
plus
body
with
lowish
well
integrated
carbonation
that
made
it
feel
a
bit
lighter
overall
this
was
a
really
well
balanced
beer
very
tasty
and
quite
drinkable
for
a
quad
drinkability
overall
its
definitely
a
great
beer
but
i
find
the
sweetness
from
the
malts
and
dark
fruit
aspects
to
become
a
bit
much
and
it
comes
across
as
a
bit
too
sweet
for
my
palate
and
stomach
abv
is
also
high
so
i
dont
think
i
could
drink
too
much
of
this
in
one
sitting
and
the
11
2
ounce
bottle
im
sure
will
prove
to
be
just
enough
im
glad
i
got
two
bottles
of
this
in
the
trade
as
im
hoping
that
additional
time
in
the
bottle
will
help
mellow
out
the
astringency
of
the
alcohol
excellent
overall
though
a
fantastic
brew
from
a
great
brewery
the
balance
of
flavor
is
extraordinary
sweet
but
not
cloying
fruity
but
not
overbearing
spice
and
oak
just
add
a
kiss
of
complexity
to
the
finish
a
well
constructed
brew
thats
deserves
to
be
near
the
top
of
the
best
quad
list
2007
vintage
poured
a
dark
brown
murky
mohogany
with
not
much
of
a
head
that
turned
to
no
head
pretty
quickly
not
very
much
lacing
left
either
got
some
of
the
expected
smells
of
dark
fruit
yeast
roast
nut
candy
sugar
spice
and
a
bit
of
funk
tastes
were
a
muted
version
of
the
smell
the
dark
candied
fruit
and
yeast
were
certainly
present
along
with
a
nuttiness
and
a
bit
of
tart
funk
which
i
did
not
expect
the
feel
was
quite
smooth
but
not
as
creamy
as
i
remember
it
being
in
the
past
never
the
less
i
could
drink
this
till
i
pass
out
the
alc
is
not
very
present
and
the
flavors
are
all
wonderful
plus
in
the
end
i
think
my
bottle
was
not
as
good
as
others
not
sure
what
happened
but
know
this
beer
is
better
than
my
experience
this
time
around
found
it
to
be
very
drinkable
and
it
was
not
as
much
of
a
sipper
as
i
was
expecting
maybe
a
bit
of
alcohol
burn
holds
this
back
a
touch
but
not
too
much
d
yeah
its
10
and
only
11
2oz
but
this
one
is
a
pleasant
sipper
although
the
smell
is
kind
of
funky
the
taste
and
mouthfeel
are
really
great
like
i
said
before
i
dont
like
quads
much
but
i
do
enjoy
this
one
quite
a
lot
yeah
it
was
8
99
a
bottle
and
yeah
i
did
buy
two
but
i
wish
i
bought
3
to
spread
out
in
the
next
few
years
to
see
how
they
age
great
and
worth
seeking
out
overall
a
very
enjoyable
beer
for
christmas
night
i
was
eating
some
toffee
that
was
topped
with
almonds
and
milk
chocolate
while
i
had
this
and
the
pairing
was
incredible
perfect
beer
for
the
toffee
really
excellent
beer
just
lovely
would
be
very
interested
to
try
the
regular
pours
a
deep
burgundy
color
with
a
big
head
and
lots
of
lace
the
aroma
is
brown
sugar
and
earthy
notes
with
some
raisins
some
floral
notes
and
a
good
nutty
and
spicy
character
the
flavor
is
raisny
again
but
has
a
nice
spicy
and
earthy
bit
with
some
molasses
and
a
warming
booziness
the
palate
is
very
full
but
a
little
bit
slick
really
a
damn
rich
delicious
beer
d
very
complex
quad
zero
sign
of
alcohol
as
i
said
hard
to
get
all
flavors
because
there
were
so
many
was
very
excited
to
see
this
on
tap
2008
vintage
nice
to
see
more
random
goodness
flowing
at
the
firk
this
one
pours
a
nice
obsidian
topped
by
a
finger
of
tan
foam
the
nose
comprises
figs
brown
sugar
light
molasses
light
black
cherry
red
apples
and
some
very
light
roasted
malts
the
taste
holds
notes
roasted
malts
lightish
molasses
brown
sugar
figs
red
apple
red
grapes
chocolate
and
some
very
light
coffee
the
body
is
a
slightly
hefty
medium
with
a
light
carbonation
and
a
very
smooth
feel
overall
a
very
nice
quad
that
ends
up
being
dangerously
drinkable
d
if
you
can
get
your
hands
on
this
do
this
is
my
favorite
style
and
it
doesnt
get
any
better
than
this
no
alcohol
present
the
entire
time
sipping
this
brew
i
suspect
i
would
like
the
traditional
old
fishermans
ale
better
served
december
8
2010
i
really
wish
i
grabbed
more
of
this
it
was
a
treat
and
a
sipped
mine
for
a
hour
or
so
smiling
not
being
a
great
fan
of
the
original
the
barrel
aging
or
perhaps
this
vintage
just
clicked
11
2oz
bottle
served
in
my
bruery
tulip
2008
vintage
lot
a4dd
pours
a
dull
chestnut
with
a
slightly
murky
clarity
head
is
half
an
inch
loose
offwhite
and
embedded
with
tiny
ringlets
head
quickly
disperses
into
a
solid
skim
and
a
frothy
band
around
the
edges
of
the
bowl
some
spots
and
strands
of
lacing
were
revealed
during
the
tasting
nose
is
tannic
expresses
some
ethanol
dark
fruit
and
a
trace
of
oak
which
was
much
more
pungent
off
the
cap
pop
but
is
much
more
diffuse
in
the
glass
taste
follows
nose
however
ethanol
character
is
not
really
present
in
the
flavor
profile
and
oak
character
all
but
disappears
mouthfeel
is
mediumlight
with
a
mild
even
carbonation
and
some
very
minor
residual
alcohol
heat
at
the
finish
a
very
good
quad
great
balance
and
a
wellhidden
abv
contributes
to
its
exceptional
drinkability
not
sure
how
much
aging
would
enhance
the
experience
on
this
one
but
it
might
be
worth
securing
an
additional
bottle
to
sit
on
for
a
few
years
d
amazing
i
wish
i
had
bought
two
bottles
must
try
fantastic
drinkability
excellent
allaround
beer
but
the
flavor
and
mouthfeel
really
bump
this
one
up
beautiful
at
10
abv
the
alcohol
is
very
well
hidden
drinkability
benefits
because
of
it
appreciable
heat
is
minimized
though
it
does
have
a
warming
effect
the
second
pour
is
actually
murky
as
some
of
the
sediment
made
it
into
the
glass
it
also
seems
a
hair
sweeter
in
any
case
worth
a
shot
very
pleasant
on
the
palate
and
highly
drinkable
this
is
what
belgian
beer
is
all
about
thanks
to
smalls
for
hooking
me
up
with
this
beauty
nice
rubybrown
pour
with
a
quickly
fading
head
and
great
lacing
unique
nutty
nose
with
prunes
oak
caramel
red
wine
and
a
touch
of
vanilla
the
taste
mirrors
the
nose
and
is
just
as
complex
the
nuttiness
and
complexity
makes
this
stand
out
from
other
quads
ive
had
it
reminds
me
of
a
nice
red
wine
very
woody
and
smooth
and
the
vanilla
and
oak
get
really
noticeable
as
it
warms
the
alcohol
is
really
well
disguised
definitely
the
smoothest
most
drinkable
and
enjoyable
quad
ive
ever
had
another
world
class
offering
from
de
struise
this
beer
was
poured
into
a
tulip
glass
its
color
was
a
dark
brown
with
very
little
offwhite
foamy
head
alcohol
is
wellhidden
and
it
doesnt
drink
like
a
10
abv
beer
it
is
mediumbodied
with
little
carbonation
drinkability
is
good
with
this
beer
d
very
tasty
beer
and
i
could
drink
gallons
of
anything
urbain
makes
d
pretty
good
a
little
boozey
dark
fruits
come
through
on
the
nose
but
also
some
malt
and
brandy
this
follows
through
on
the
palate
and
it
is
almost
like
a
christmas
pudding
lots
of
dark
fruit
figs
caramelised
cherries
dates
etc
there
is
clearly
some
biscuit
malt
there
as
well
and
the
hopping
counteracts
some
of
the
sweetness
overall
it
is
a
little
too
sweet
for
me
had
a
2008
recently
and
wonder
if
the
extra
year
is
too
much
for
the
beer
really
intense
flavour
for
sure
but
quite
heavy
and
i
would
struggle
to
drink
more
than
one
overall
very
tasty
i
threw
a
second
bottle
in
the
cellar
this
will
age
phenomenally
im
surprised
the
lack
of
oak
i
tastesmell
jd
2008
bottle
poured
into
a
new
belgium
glass
opaque
brown
with
ruby
edges
small
mocha
head
with
some
lacing
smell
is
caramel
and
sweet
malt
up
front
followed
by
wet
barrel
sweet
tobacco
and
a
hint
of
orange
peel
taste
is
not
as
big
as
i
thought
it
would
be
only
slightly
sweet
caramel
malts
with
a
touch
of
bitterness
and
milk
chocolate
coffee
doesnt
have
the
characteristic
quad
yeast
flavor
i
was
expecting
long
roasty
aftertaste
and
alcohol
is
very
well
hidden
mouthfeel
is
more
like
a
stout
then
a
quad
medium
to
heavy
and
a
mild
carbonation
a
great
beer
overall
although
i
am
not
sure
it
is
completely
within
the
style
parameters
as
far
as
the
ba
style
description
goes
it
fits
d
i
like
the
regular
pannepot
a
fair
amount
and
this
is
even
better
a
really
fantastic
beer
and
one
that
i
would
easily
drink
again
great
beer
mouthfeel
is
very
smooth
and
silky
almost
oily
but
not
offensively
so
very
well
crafted
but
a
one
and
done
for
sure
2008
vintage
light
pour
for
this
quad
a
somewhat
lightish
brown
almost
cola
colored
lots
of
raisins
and
belgian
sugars
in
the
nose
along
with
a
good
bit
of
whiskey
smooth
taste
rich
and
hearty
almost
chewy
like
a
strong
stout
oakaged
barrels
show
through
with
the
whiskeylike
smoothness
dates
raisins
and
other
dark
fruits
emerge
immensely
drinkable
a
true
classic
here
and
one
i
need
to
find
again
theres
not
much
bad
to
say
about
pannepot
reserva
aside
from
the
nose
being
a
little
weak
its
extremely
impressive
the
flavor
is
very
deep
and
complex
personally
i
dont
think
its
quite
as
good
as
pannepotold
fishermans
ale
but
its
not
far
off
at
all
this
is
very
impressive
beer
that
needs
to
be
experienced
find
a
bottle
overall
impression
lacking
on
the
aroma
and
appearance
but
outstanding
flavor
complex
and
unique
this
is
good
but
not
worth
the
price
2008
vintage
d
i
was
very
excited
to
try
this
one
but
after
i
did
i
was
left
with
a
feeling
of
disappointment
the
original
version
is
better
and
cheaper
ill
stick
with
that
one
from
now
on
this
is
a
very
nice
brew
it
is
full
of
dark
fruit
flavor
and
very
smooth
one
of
three
versions
of
pannepot
ive
had
the
pleasure
of
sampling
recently
this
one
aged
in
french
oak
barrels
2008
version
this
one
has
a
soft
pour
as
an
aged
ale
should
relatively
calm
russet
brown
definitely
picking
up
plenty
of
oak
in
the
nose
a
nice
layer
all
the
typical
pannepot
flavor
is
there
but
the
barreling
and
aging
and
wood
have
mellowed
it
out
quite
a
bit
very
nice
layers
of
sweet
spiced
plum
raisin
rum
cake
nice
matlyness
and
depth
leathery
velvety
but
slightly
thinned
out
mouthfeel
from
the
usual
version
this
is
an
outstanding
beer
quite
different
really
from
the
standard
pannepot
not
necessarily
better
or
worse
but
a
different
beast
having
sampled
the
regular
pannepot
the
reserva
the
pannepeut
danish
and
the
pannepot
wild
i
have
to
say
my
favorite
is
the
old
standard
issue
with
a
good
year
or
two
of
age
on
it
but
they
all
have
their
quirks
making
each
one
different
which
is
why
we
like
beer
cheers
i
need
to
drink
quads
more
often
and
pannepot
reserva
justifies
that
statement
its
not
the
best
smelling
quad
but
its
arguably
one
of
the
best
tasting
and
drinking
quads
i
have
had
overall
expensive
yes
worth
it
yes
this
is
excellent
its
going
to
be
tough
to
try
to
cellar
my
other
bottles
cheers
taste
is
amazing
possibly
the
best
quad
ive
had
rich
and
sweet
super
complex
and
flavorful
very
easy
drinking
its
so
smooth
and
rich
d
i
find
this
to
be
an
overly
drinkable
brew
for
the
style
a
beer
that
is
great
to
sit
back
and
enjoy
while
you
take
all
the
flavors
and
complexities
in
the
10
00
alcohol
is
a
bit
present
and
if
it
would
be
masked
a
little
different
i
feel
this
would
have
received
a
5
in
score
none
the
less
stellar
brew
a
really
complex
beer
like
most
quads
love
all
the
flavors
and
how
they
melded
together
if
it
wasnt
for
the
price
i
could
drink
this
all
the
time
d
i
thought
this
was
a
great
quad
the
nose
on
it
was
great
would
love
to
try
this
one
again
d
a
great
take
on
the
style
thicker
in
texture
than
i
expected
but
it
added
an
additional
richness
to
the
beer
somehow
smooth
as
can
be
with
great
flavors
extremely
easy
to
consume
and
enjoy
my
bottle
did
not
last
long
drinkability
i
have
to
admit
that
this
is
quite
good
although
this
is
making
me
want
to
revisit
the
original
i
think
i
liked
it
better
i
think
the
oak
aging
may
have
bogged
down
all
of
the
bright
and
exciting
flavors
of
the
original
fishermans
ale
deep
amberbrown
pour
with
a
thin
fizzy
head
that
fades
to
just
a
faint
ring
coats
the
glass
nicely
big
belgian
quad
aromas
in
the
nose
loads
of
spiceclove
dark
fruits
toffee
malts
some
burnt
coffee
notes
as
well
pretty
much
what
i
expected
but
still
very
complex
taste
follows
the
nose
but
the
sweet
slightly
boozy
big
malt
flavors
really
kick
in
not
as
thickcreamy
as
other
quads
ive
had
but
still
a
nice
meal
in
a
bottle
glad
i
picked
up
a
few
bottles
of
this
db
the
regular
pannepot
blew
me
away
with
complexity
this
one
just
seems
too
old
i
will
have
to
find
a
newer
bottle
it
reminds
of
the
2007
van
der
kaiser
blauw
i
had
months
back
a
ton
of
stale
caramel
malt
and
nothing
much
else
i
enjoyed
it
while
it
lasted
but
it
didnt
make
me
want
to
pour
another
one
immediately
d
for
a
barrel
aged
quad
this
drinks
very
nicely
could
be
a
very
dangerous
combination
mediumplus
bodied
with
a
creamy
mouthfeel
wellhidden
10
makes
this
one
dangerously
drinkable
in
the
final
analysis
id
put
it
in
my
top
tier
of
quads
though
toward
the
back
of
the
group
full
bodied
a
little
thick
and
slick
adequate
carbonation
very
drinkable
because
i
didnt
even
realize
i
was
on
my
final
sips
o
this
is
one
ive
been
waiting
a
while
to
try
and
it
didnt
disappoint
ill
be
picking
up
a
few
more
next
time
im
in
the
city
this
really
is
a
tremendous
beer
i
was
seriously
disappointed
by
pannepot
and
found
it
overly
roasty
however
the
barrel
aging
has
completely
muffled
those
notes
in
the
reserva
and
added
a
huge
vinuous
character
phenomenal
quad
flavor
is
definitely
interesting
its
very
good
but
completely
different
from
the
traditional
pannepot
this
has
a
lot
more
overripe
fruit
notes
some
raisins
and
dates
and
also
some
sweet
fruits
like
plums
medium
body
medium
carbonation
mild
booze
with
basically
no
booze
warmthburn
great
tasting
beer
though
overall
from
de
struise
this
bottle
is
from
2008
and
was
purchased
at
downtown
wine
and
spirits
in
somerville
the
pour
reveals
an
opaque
brownish
beer
with
some
ruby
hues
and
two
fingers
of
white
heading
nose
is
of
juicy
dark
fruits
such
as
prunes
figs
grapes
and
dates
some
brown
bread
and
mild
alcohol
can
also
be
picked
up
on
as
it
warms
big
blast
of
candied
sugar
in
the
beginning
of
the
taste
followed
by
more
dark
fruit
nectar
quick
hit
of
hops
and
carbonation
right
toward
the
finish
and
a
lingering
dryness
at
the
end
the
body
of
this
beer
is
big
and
in
your
face
and
filled
with
complexities
drinkability
is
excellent
for
a
sipper
like
this
allow
this
one
to
unfold
for
sure
i
would
also
recommend
pairing
this
with
food
last
time
i
matched
this
up
with
a
filet
mignon
which
was
nice
however
i
would
personally
recommend
some
kind
of
creamy
blue
cheese
excellent
stuff
here
from
struise
right
up
there
with
the
examples
the
trappists
make
9614
had
my
last
2008
today
at
6
years
old
the
flavors
were
feeling
a
little
muted
but
still
nice
classic
pannepot
yeast
profile
brown
sugar
caramel
spice
and
dark
fruit
aplenty
more
oak
than
i
remember
previously
comes
through
pretty
well
very
easy
to
drink
maybe
one
of
the
smoothest
10
beers
in
recent
memory
mouthfeel
felt
a
bit
on
the
limper
side
d
the
mouth
feel
lets
me
down
this
beer
even
though
i
dont
want
to
because
its
tasty
and
i
want
to
savor
it
really
hardly
any
alcohol
detected
and
the
flavors
really
flow
well
i
would
love
to
find
a
bottle
of
some
older
vintages
overall
a
beauty
i
cannot
wait
to
try
black
albert
after
drinking
this
one
notes
vintage
2007
incredibly
complex
yet
very
well
balanced
oak
flavors
arent
overly
strong
but
definitely
present
and
make
a
great
difference
really
great
beer
recommended
this
is
a
very
drinkable
big
beer
and
the
bottle
size
is
about
the
perfect
serving
size
i
really
enjoyed
sipping
on
this
beer
and
many
thanks
to
sleepydave
for
bringing
this
over
i
still
havent
cracked
one
of
my
regular
pannepots
but
after
having
this
ill
have
to
try
one
of
those
soon
there
are
really
no
flaws
associated
with
this
beer
and
i
think
it
has
just
become
one
of
my
favorite
belgians
i
will
definitely
have
to
seek
out
another
bottle
of
this
probably
couldnt
drink
a
lot
this
too
rich
and
sweet
nice
for
a
small
amount
like
dessert
d
its
decent
but
i
prefer
the
original
and
the
grand
reserva
to
this
one
overall
i
think
its
a
really
good
bear
but
i
was
expecting
more
i
had
two
traditionnal
pannepot
2007
before
for
the
first
one
i
had
the
same
reaction
for
the
second
one
not
on
the
same
day
i
thought
it
was
one
of
the
best
bear
i
knew
i
found
it
better
than
the
rochefort
10
for
this
beer
the
pannepot
reserva
2007
i
think
its
between
this
two
reaction
i
would
not
get
tired
after
a
bear
but
i
could
not
drink
more
than
one
and
the
rochefort
is
still
a
better
bear
than
this
one
an
excellent
beer
overall
the
others
there
didnt
think
it
was
quite
so
impressive
but
damn
i
thought
it
was
good
and
its
pretty
rare
too
overall
essentially
this
brew
is
pannepot
without
the
added
spices
and
herbs
though
pannepeut
is
a
nice
beer
on
its
own
right
i
dont
think
it
even
compares
to
pannepot
in
terms
of
complexity
and
enjoyment
on
the
other
hand
i
can
definitely
see
the
appeal
in
this
brew
and
can
understand
why
some
would
chose
it
over
pannepot
this
is
one
i
would
have
again
but
would
reach
for
the
regular
pannepot
nine
times
out
of
ten
worth
checking
out
to
make
up
your
own
mind
if
you
get
the
chance
and
especially
fun
for
a
sidebyside
d
strong
on
taste
would
be
a
great
addition
to
a
good
creme
brule
ok
doing
a
vertical
of
the
06
07
and
08
the
06
had
a
small
head
slight
aroma
of
alcohol
and
caramel
malts
and
flavor
of
caramel
malts
slight
cider
some
citrus
and
a
decent
lingering
after
taste
the
07
had
a
medium
head
strong
aroma
of
malts
and
alcohol
significant
carbonation
and
some
rough
notes
of
malts
and
alcohol
the
08
was
like
wood
cleaner
ethanol
and
bandaids
ill
hope
this
was
just
a
bad
bottle
i
drank
this
from
a
11
2
oz
bottle
from
the
de
struise
web
shop
the
beer
pours
medium
brown
like
a
quad
should
look
but
a
little
lighter
of
a
brown
than
the
pannepot
there
are
tons
of
yeasy
floaties
the
head
is
disappointing
only
rising
a
little
then
gone
right
away
the
aroma
is
really
dark
fruits
raisins
caramel
with
a
slight
hop
finish
the
taste
is
ok
doesnt
quite
live
up
to
a
great
quad
though
a
little
light
in
feel
and
a
very
alcoholic
finish
the
taste
is
in
general
is
just
kind
of
flat
not
as
tasty
creamy
or
complex
as
the
pannepot
but
still
a
decent
beer
d
a
dangerously
quaffable
beverage
particularly
given
its
high
abv
i
certainly
wish
we
had
this
available
in
the
states
dthis
is
extremely
tasty
and
big
great
feel
on
the
palate
hides
the
alcohol
extremely
well
the
oak
aging
is
faint
and
subtle
but
still
present
d
this
was
a
very
enjoyable
treat
that
i
wish
i
had
a
couple
more
of
i
wouldnt
mind
getting
a
couple
more
to
cellar
a
little
longer
i
think
this
one
should
be
a
staple
on
most
peoples
lists
of
beers
to
try
pours
dark
brownblack
with
a
thin
head
despite
initially
gushing
from
the
bottle
aromas
of
deep
caramel
vanilla
nuttiness
and
alcohol
palate
is
of
more
vanilla
a
fruitiness
of
cherries
or
blackberries
rose
water
and
a
little
oak
a
slightly
tart
finish
with
a
bit
of
sweetness
carbonation
wetness
and
vanilla
exhale
that
evokes
a
cream
soda

and
something

also

me

still
around

a

a
real
success
d
outstanding
brew
barrel
aged
pannepot
all
i
can
say
is
wow
the
smoothness
that
the
barrel
aging
adds
is
over
the
top
and
if
there
were
any
edges
on
pannepot
which
i
never
detected
any
panny
by
itself
is
a
world
class
brew
the
barrel
aging
adds
a
whole
new
depth
to
this
struise
masterpiece
all
the
wonderfull
flavors
from
the
pannepot
the
carmel
vanilla
spice
smoothness
and
the
added
aroma
of
the
oak
aging
truly
push
this
beer
into
a
aficionados
cellar
collection
to
be
savored
my
highest
praise
a
true
masterpiece
its
metal
overall
impression
this
is
different
from
the
quads
that
i
ususally
drink
st
bernardus
12
gouden
carolus
grand
cru
etc
but
it
is
definitely
a
great
beer
if
only
i
could
get
this
on
a
regular
basis
i
cant
speak
to
the
accuracy
of
its
world
wide
rating
but
i
can
understand
why
people
would
rate
it
so
highly
this
is
a
must
get
if
you
can
i
would
even
recommend
mail
ordering
it
if
you
cant
get
it
locally
as
and
after
thought
i
think
gouden
carolus
grand
cru
is
still
my
favorite
quad
its
delicious
d
very
good
better
than
the
grand
reserva
version
o
very
close
to
the
regular
pannepot
a
bit
milder
on
alcohol
and
taste
but
of
course
a
brilliant
beer
notes
suitable
beer
for
my
600th
a
one
off
beer
that
i
brought
back
from
belgium
myself
its
depth
and
the
mastery
shown
in
how
it
presents
were
an
honor
to
experience
creamy
body
is
delicately
carbonated
another
amazing
beer
from
struise
urbain
is
the
man
great
malty
quad
perfectly
compimented
by
the
barrel
aging
that
adds
a
slightly
dry
wine
and
oak
presence
this
is
a
big
fruity
and
vinous
quad
the
46
ounces
that
i
tried
was
satiating
overall
an
excellent
brew
although
not
quite
as
good
as
the
standard
pannepot
definitely
recommended
though
pours
a
murky
tawny
color
with
a
large
and
longlasting
head
that
leaves
a
coating
of
foam
on
the
glass
the
nose
is
rich
full
of
chocolate
raisins
and
molasses
theres
a
faint
red
winelike
tartness
and
a
odd
mineral
aroma
beneath
the
surface
on
the
palate
its
fruity
and
slightly
tart
like
a
semiripe
blackberry
a
big
chocolate
malt
flavor
makes
up
the
foundation
with
subtler
notes
of
tannins
minerals
and
figs
beneath
that
the
finish
is
semidry
and
semitart
with
a
light
astringency
the
full
body
and
chocolatey
almost
roasty
malt
profile
make
this
an
unusual
quad
and
a
fairly
good
one
the
head
quickly
turns
rocky
as
three
fingers
of
deep
biscuity
tan
bubbles
fade
slowly
leaving
a
bit
of
lace
body
is
almost
black
but
does
show
lots
of
brown
on
the
edges
when
held
to
light
nose
is
a
big
bold
rustic
spice
profile
some
phenol
spices
with
tones
of
leather
wood
sun
scorched
soil
raisins
and
dark
fruit
all
come
through
on
the
nose
with
first
sip
you
immediately
take
a
step
back
and
say
wow
this
beer
is
something
special
first
off
i
have
to
say
that
this
is
probably
the
best
ive
ever
had
a
10
alcohol
hidden
and
that
is
totally
a
complement
rich
toffee
and
bready
malts
are
mixed
with
dark
fruits
for
a
wonderful
complexity
creamy
smooth
with
lengthy
richness
and
soft
spices
all
through
the
palate
carbonation
is
just
right
and
carries
all
the
flavors
well
oak
is
classic
in
this
one
and
really
adds
maturity
mouthfeel
is
oh
so
lovely
and
slightly
thick
you
would
really
have
to
stop
me
from
drinking
this
beer
all
night
but
at
some
time
you
could
remind
me
that
it
is
23
a
bottle
and
10
alcohol
overall
this
is
a
tasty
beer
but
for
the
price
i
would
recommend
sticking
with
the
nonreserva
though
if
youre
curious
its
certainly
worth
a
try
brown
colored
beer
with
a
firm
tan
head
rockin
aroma
showcases
the
intricate
complexities
of
pannepot
with
added
notes
of
vanilla
red
burgundy
and
a
very
light
toasted
wood
nose
is
awesome
flavor
is
mildly
disappointing
the
barrel
seemed
to
mellow
and
tame
the
original
pannepot
but
it
seemed
to
lose
a
bit
of
its
flavor
intensity
and
concentration
doesnt
quite
have
the
depth
of
flavor
or
body
of
regular
pannepot
that
being
said
still
a
killer
brew
d
a
fine
sipper
luscious
feel
complex
flavors
enticing
aroma
not
quite
as
masterful
as
the
belgian
but
still
a
delicious
beer
a
strong
recommendation
and
a
beer
im
glad
to
have
a
few
more
of
on
hand
and
even
more
at
the
local
market
pours
a
clearish
reddish
brown
color
body
suspended
particles
small
offwhite

dark

aroma
spices
a
nice
belgian
aroma
somewhat
musty
maybe
coriander
or
something
sweet
spices
very
aromatic
dark
fruity
taste
plum
and
dark
grape
soft
mouthfeel
some
smokiness
present
too
very
tasty
not
too
overwhelming
poured
a
medium
to
deeper
reddish
tinged
brown
color
with
an
averaged
sized
off
white
head
aromas
of
wood
dark
fruits
raisins
and
plums
caramel
and
some
earthiness
the
wood
really
came
out
more
and
more
as
i
spent
time
with
this
one
tastes
of
wood
the
same
dark
fruits
and
vanilla
alcohol
content
well
hidden
very
decent
mouthfeel
i
wish
the
carbonation
was
a
little
more
lively
and
soft
it
feels
a
bit
watery
in
midpalate
alcohol
is
well
hidden
only
a
little
bit
in
the
tail
of
the
sip
to
help
warm
you
up
the
mouthfeel
is
a
tad
thin
as
the
carbonation
doesnt
really
lift
the
beer
d
pretty
good
this
is
tasty
the
alcohol
is
completely
hidden
id
call
this
a
reallynicetohave
but
not
a
must
have
a
dark
creamy
brown
in
color
a
tight
light
tan
head
that
sticks
to
the
glass
s
creamy
dark
fruit
and
bready
yeast
t
nice
malty
taste
with
dark
raisin
and
fig
taste
maybe
some
slight
apple
taste
a
bready
yeast
taste
and
nice
caramel
malt
m
nice
and
creamy
low
carbonation
and
easy
drinking
quad
d
pretty
dead
on
to
what
i
expected
a
standout
quad
very
rich
in
malt
dark
fruits
and
yeast
complex
enough
for
balanced
flavors
but
not
too
complex
to
confuse
the
pallate
slightly
tart
finish
possible
orange
peel
note
in
finish
alcohol
still
very
evident
through
the
heaviness
of
this
beer
big
body
with
the
alcohol
suppressed
makes
this
brew
easy
enough
too
drink
just
dont
forget
what
the
10
abv
can
do
to
you
its
bigger
than
it
seems
yet
not
as
warming
as
yould
expect
great
tasty
stuff
taste
is
very
much
cacao
powder
roasted
malts
are
present
but
very
mild
and
smooth
the
alcohol
is
warming
but
still
mild
considering
the
10
abv
there
is
a
nice
candisugar
twist
to
this
beer
the
yeast
adds
notes
of
juniper
and
to
a
lesser
extent
coriander
mouthfeel
is
thick
a
little
syrupy
and
sticky
a
very
complez
and
heavy
beer
that
is
a
real
sipper
overall
i
thought
this
was
a
really
great
belgian
ale
the
flavors
were
rich
and
pure
mingling
so
well
and
cross
such
a
wide
range
of
style
that
it
was
almost
impossible
to
nail
down
where
it
was
coming
from
a
deep
dark
ale
this
one
would
surely
please
anyone
who
gives
it
a
try
does
it
live
up
to
the
hype
i
will
let
you
decide
that
my
feelings
are
kind
of
mixed
on
the
subject
personally
but
one
thing
for
sure
it
is
damn
good
good
characterful
beer
id
like
some
christmas
pudding
with
this
i
would
highly
recommend
this
beer
drinkability
a
completely
different
beer
from
the
import
version
in
my
opinion
this
one
barely
tastes
spiced
at
all
and
what
spice
that
is
present
gets
subsumed
in
the
alcohol
in
some
ways
its
better
in
some
ways
not
so
good
but
its
definitely
worth
seeking
out
just
like
the
original
next
time
im
down
in
atlanta
i
intend
to
pick
up
one
of
each
so
i
can
do
a
horizontal
serving
type
bottle
very
much
looking
forward
to
the
new
version
which
will
be
unspiced
and
as
i
recall
a
bit
drier
pours
dark
brown
out
of
the
bottle
and
settles
into
a
dark
mahogany
in
the
glass
the
head
is
fluffy
and
offwhite
and
dissipates
fairly
quickly
to
a
ring
with
good
lacing
the
aroma
is
sweet
with
dark
fruit
plums
and
raisins
and
a
bit
of
candied
sugar
and
roasted
malts
there
are
some
spices
in
the
aroma
but
very
faint
the
taste
is
a
little
less
complex
than
the
original
version
with
a
little
less
spiciness
and
a
heavy
dose
of
grape
sweetness
theres
a
little
bit
of
cola
flavor
in
there
as
well
on
top
of
a
roasted
malt
base
with
some
caramel
tones
the
mourhfeel
is
medium
bodied
with
a
little
less
carbonation
than
the
original
there
is
a
little
less
sour
kick
on
this
one
and
for
me
leads
to
a
slightly
more
drinkable
beer
either
way
this
is
a
slight
notch
below
the
original
but
a
great
beer
on
its
own
d
doesnt
drink
like
a
10
but
its
still
heavy
quite
a
good
beer
pours
a
dark
cola
color
with
tan
specks
of
yeast
suspended
throughout
a
small
resilient
tan
head
is
present
which
is
reminiscent
of
froth
on
top
of
a
cappuccino
i
smell
toffee
rose
grapes
and
caramel
tastes
of
raisins
figs
sugary
malt
pepper
and
finishes
with
ginger
nice
of
them
to
help
clear
the
palate
before
the
next
sip
the
perfect
amount
of
sweetness
nowhere
near
cloying
surprisingly
smooth
creamy
with

the
alcohol
is
almost
entirely
hidden
overall
delicious
it
is
a
complex
yet
very
drinkable
quad
highly
recommended
very
drinkable

i

will

pannepot
old
fishermans
ale
danish
version
is
a
wonderful
quadrupel
that
should
come
in
750
ml
bottles
my
measly
11
2
ounces
is
now
gone
already
and
i
was
just
getting
into
a
groove
itll
be
interesting
to
see
how
the
version
brewed
for
the
american
market
stacks
up
to
this
one
pretty
well
ill
bet
good
but
i
prefer
the
other
drinkability
ive
only
had
the
danish
version
of
this
one
and
would
love
to
see
how
the
american
version
pairs
up
a
very
unique
brew
and
one
i
tend
to
enjoy
very
complex
and
very
sweet
to
boot
sweetness
keeps
the
drinkability
down
im
starting
to
find
a
real
appreciation
for
belgians
and
this
is
near
the
absolute
top
of
those
that
ive
had
ive
been
wanting
to
try
this
forever
and
to
be
able
to
secure
the
danish
version
is
extra
special
you
rock
aliza
overall
very
enjoyable
parts
of
the
offering
but
they
arent
necessarily
synced
up
with
each
other
as
well
as
would
be
desired
strong
effort
nonetheless
the
beer
poured
a
deep
black
body
with
a
very
thick
tan
head
fluffy
and
rich
the
beer
had
a
deep
earthy
nose
some
chocolate
tones
as
well
the
taste
gave
me
dried
fruit
up
front
and
then
some
alcohol
tones
as
well
very
pleasing
there
is
some
subtle
but
distinct
wood
notes
as
well
from
the
barrel
aging
this
version
of
pannepot
is
an
excellent
well
balanced
and
complex
beer
i
only
wish
i
had
tried
this
bottle
along
side
the
other
versions
of
pannepot
maybe
next
time
what
a
great
quad
i
need
to
seek
out
some
more
of
this
stuff
d
i
like
this
beer
a
ton
this
may
be
the
best
quad
i
have
yet
to
have
certainly
up
there
with
roch
10
and
westy
12
yeah
there
is
a
lot
going
on
with
this
beer
but
much
of
what
is
going
on
isnt
good
and
that
which
is
is
obscured
by
all
the
nastiness
i
guess
if
one
is
inclined
to
like
quads
im
not
it
isnt
bad
but
really
i
mean
i
can
appreciate
a
style
i
do
not
like
but
i
cannot
appreciate
this
beer
incarnations
i
admit
i
was
pretty
damn
excited
to
give
it
a
whirl
poured
into
a
st
bernardus
chalice
smells
of
figs
raisins
malt
and
nuts
superb
on
the
palate
plummy
raisiny
almost
vinious
with
a
depth
of
character
that
could
cause
one
to
contemplate
drinking
4
or
5
of
these
in
one
day
just
to
nail
down
all
the
tastessenses
that
this
outstanding
beer
presents
i
love
achel
extra
but
this
to
me
is
way
better
now
ill
have
to
get
my
hands
on
the
other
versions
wow
this
is
a
good
beer
incredibly
complex
and
smooth
theres
a
bit
of
sweetness
in
the
taste
mouthfeel
is
medium
but
it
basically
dances
in
your
mouth
then
runs
down
your
throat
perfect
amount
of
carbonation
almost
perfect
on
the
mouthfeel
this
is
a
pure
enjoyment
to
drink

a

with
great
retention
and
some
good
lacing
aroma
consists
of
bubblegum
ester
with
some
candi
sugar
and
some
light

taste
is
comprised
of
a
sweet
malt
base
which
is
well
balance
with
some
bubblegum
ester
and
some
light
spicy
yeast
at
the
end
very
well
balance
with
no
apparent
alcohol
and
a
full
body
with
great
carbonation
i
thought
it
was
slightly
less
complex
then
the
regular
version
but
i
would
have
to
do
a
sidebyside
comparison
this
is
worlds
apart
from
the
belgian
version
i
love
so
much
this
beer
lacks
the
wonderful
spice
found
in
the
first
version
its
booze
equally
pronounced
lacks
the
depth
of
flavor
required
to
make
it
pleasant
and
its
sugars
do
not
add
complex
raison
or
fig
character
but
rather
detract
making
this
beer
too
sweet
to
enjoy
drink
incredibly
drinkable
for
a
ten
percenter
made
quenching
by
the
fresh
tartness
the
mouthfeel
is
luscious
and
creamy
tonguemassaging
despite
the
fact
that
the
alcohol
isnt
shy
at
all
this
is
very
drinkable
overall
this
is
very
enjoyable
although
i
do
prefer
the
nondanish
version
both
brews
foamed
a
bit
as
soon
as
i
popped
the
crown
but
the
head
was
nearly
nonexistent
on
this
one
also
despite
having
had
over
a
week
to
settle
in
the
fridge
the
yeast
refused
to
part
with
the
beer
and
arrived
in
my
glass
in
all
their
chunky
glory
the
taste
was
quite
similar
between
the
two
but
id
need
to
do
a
side
by
side
in
order
to
really
pinpoint
exactly
what
makes
each
unique
in
this
regard
overall
it
does
not
rank
up
there
the
with
abt
quads
but
is
a
nice
beer
nonetheless
nice
sweet
brown
sugar
tastes
mingled
with
dark
fruits
its
an
easy
drinker
at
such
a
high
abv
i
am
eager
to
try
the
belgian
verison
to
see
how
this
one
stacks
up
thanks
again
go
out
to
aaron
it
is
not
the
spectacular
brew
i
was
hoping
for
but
it
is
nonetheless
very
well
crafted
and
pleasant
worth
picking
up
at
least
a
six
pack
on
my
next
chance
overall
pannepot
light
i
think
i
prefer
it
to
the
regular
version
overall
a
nice
dessert
type
beer
pannepot
old
fishermans
ale
denmark
version
pours
a
dark
brown
with
only
an
off
white
ring
of
head
around
the
edge
of
the
glass
poured
from
a
brown
11
2
ounce
bottle
dark
fruit
wafts
out
of
the
glass
the
flavor
is
also
dark
fruit
with
a
hint
of
spices
the
mouthfeel
is
thin
but
appropriate
i
cant
put
my
finger
on
any
differences
from
the
regular
version
i
would
like
to
sample
them
back
to
back
one
day
excellent
beer
d
it
starts
out
a
bit
rough
but
you
really
do
warm
up
to
it
very
nicley
i
wish
i
could
even
find
someone
to
trade
this
with
me
great
beer
and
i
would
love
to
have
it
again
but
chances
probably
arent
to
high
thanks
to
delirium
cafe
for
carrying
this
this
version
was
much
better
than
the
original
version
imo
with
not
even
close
to
the
amount
of
spices
as
the
other
version
had
this
one
was
also
lighter
in
color
already
thinning
this
is
not
a
beer
for
long
aging
i
have
never
seen
it
in
any
local
store
until
the
last
month
so
this
is
the
newest
vintage
i
can
buy
i
do
believe
it
would
be
much
better
fresh
it
seems
the
last
3
years
have
be
a
little
rough
perhaps
storage
conditions
were
subpar
there
is
no
way
to
know
the
original
quality
of
this
beer
shows
through
however
t
another
terrific
quad
that
is
right
up
there
with
the
best
of
them
flavours
are
balanced
nicely
and
once
again
destruise
doesnt
disappoint
overall
seriously
delicious
stuff
almost
like
a
barley
wine
in
some
ways
the
alcohol
is
very
well
hidden
and
it
has
aged
beautifully
overall
really
nice
notes
of
chocolate
malts
and
tart
fruit
with
an
airy
carbonation
its
a
disappointment
there
was
that
odd
wet
penny
note
and
slick
oily
mouthfeel
this
taste
like
it
could
have
been
really
good
inferior
to
regular
pannepot
but
still
fairly
tasty
probably
wouldnt
buy
it
again

a
very
enjoyable
offering
oi
was
really
excited
to
try
this
beer
since
i
like
pannepot
so
much
but
i
felt
a
bit
let
down
the
heavy
roast
component
and
lower
levels
of
sweetness
are
not
necessarily
what
i
expect
or
want
out
of
a
quad
style
beer
that
being
said
this
beer
is
unique
and
makes
for
an
interesting
drink
the
strong
flavors
and
higher
alcohol
heat
mean
this
beer
is
not
for
the
faint
of
heart
ill
revisit
this
winter
poured
a
brown
body
with
one
finger
head
and
some
lace
that
just
doesnt
go
away
the
aroma
not
only
has
a
touch
of
booze
but
strong
dark
fruits
such
as
figs
toffee
not
quite
raisins
to
me
but
close
some
yeast
and
hints
of
sugary
sweetness
more
of
the
same
in
the
body
as
a
medium
body
holds
together
some
dark
fruits
and
sweetness
for
a
simple
and
enjoyable
beer
that
finishes
with
a
hoppy
tart
crispness
that
i
was
not
expecting
and
the
abv
is
well
hidden
wouldnt
have
pegged
it
close
to
10
much
like
some
of
the
other
incarnations
of
this
beer
im
not
as
awed
by
it
as
other
folks
for
whatever
reason
it
seems
to
miss
the
belgian
quad
mark
not
quite
be
an
old
ale
and
end
up
honestly
being
closer
to
the
stingo
styles
with
a
slight
tart
or
tannic
element
but
none
of
those
sum
this
up
stylistically
and
to
me
it
just
doesnt
taste
all
that
good
big
thick
amber
malt
body
mostly
still
with
a
nose
of
dried
stone
fruit
figs
tart
cherries
booze
and
stale
grain
sugar
the
flavor
is
similar
and
while
it
almost
smells
infected
the
other
reviews
here
tell
me
thats
how
its
supposed
to
be
tartness
our
of
nowhere
battles
sweetness
and
booze
is
there
all
the
way
to
me
its
not
that
well
refined
its
not
that
different
and
its
not
that
special
maybe
i
had
a
bad
bottle
or
something
but
ive
thought
this
about
reserva
and
others
will
have
to
revisit
it
in
time
but
its
lack
of
carbonation
hurt
it
as
did
the
long
tannic
finish
strange
brew
but
not
one
i
cared
for
too
much
this
time
around
o
beers
like
this
remind
me
why
i
love
de
struise
its
extreme
yet
immaculately
balanced
and
delicate
all
at
the
same
time
i
wouldnt
have
had
any
trouble
killing
several
glasses
of
this
thats
for
damn

so
well
with
the
nicaraguan

andre

has
done
so
well
with

line
but
enough
about
the
smoke
lets
talk
more
beer
perfect
level
of
acidity
like
a
red
grape
ripened
to
the
point
that
its
ready
to
bulge
and
transmorph
into
a
plump
raisin
mouthfeel
is
magnificent
perfect
driven
naturally
carbonated
mouthfeel
leaves
the
palate
with
some
effervescence
to
carry
on
the
complex
body
and
flavor
overall
quite
frankly
im
in
love
with
this
beer
yet
it
needs
more
age
to
truly
express
itself
the
english
on
the
front
of
the
label
says
2012
and
it
calls
itself
old
monks
ale
i
can
see
why
o
a
very
nice
beer
and
similar
to
pannepot
my
only
problem
is
that
i
think
my
bottle
has
been
sitting
on
a
shelf
for
too
long
its
still
good
but
i
cant
help
but
think
it
may
have
been
better
i
have
yet
to
be
disappointed
by
de
struise
brouwers
and
this
beer
only
reaffirms
my
belief
that
i
should
seek
their
beers
out
at
every
opportunity
possible
quite
good
pours
a
murky
dark
brown
with
a
foamy
khaki
head
that
settles
to
wisps
of
film
on
top
of
the
beer
small
dots
of
lace
form
around
the
glass
on
the
drink
down
smell
is
of
toasted
malt
roasted
malt
molasses
char
and
spice
aromas
taste
is
much
the
same
with
toast
molasses
burnt
fruit
and
spice
flavors
on
the
finish
there
is
a
mild
amount
of
roast
bitterness
on
the
palate
with
each
sip
this
beer
has
a
lower
level
of
carbonation
with
a
slightly
crisp
mouthfeel
overall
this
is
a
pretty
good
beer
that
is
tasty
but
i
think
the
set
of
aromas
on
this
one
are
much
better
this
is
about
two
years
old
and
the
10
abv
has
not
completely
faded
indeed
the
alcohol
burn
plays
volleyball
with
the
dark
fruits
malts
and
tart
semifloral
hop
finale
but
overall
i
found
it
to
be
an
enjoyable
beer
a
solid
beer
this
should
be
considered
one
of
the
tops
in
its
class
a
calm
mellow
brew
highly
recommended
this
quad
says
it
all
with
its
big
malt
and
boozelike
tones
moderately
sweet
but
the
alcohol
edge
and
hop
bitterness
keep
things
balanced
and
interesting
bold
and
flavorful
with
a
knockout
punch
of
alcohol
make
this
one
a
fine
slow
sipper
overall
decent
but
a
disappointment
compared
to
the
top
quads
from
belgium
o
good
stuff
though
this
isnt
blowing
my
mind
like
some
other
de
struise
offerings
perhaps
it
wouldve
been
better
fresh
a
2013
bottle
picked
up
at
the
brewery
a
week
ago
cellared
and
then
briefly
fridged
poured
briskly
and
directly
into
a
tulip
almost
inert
only
a
bit
bit
of
froth
and
a
ring
of
continued
bubbling
action
around
the
rim
of
the
liquid
mahogany
with
some
ruby
glints
but
good
legs
no
sediment
enticing
to
look
at
not
a
big
bloom
of
aroma
but
still
enticing
with
clove
cherry
cinnamon
root
beer
a
bit
of
basement
workshop
meaning
sawdust
and
a
tad
of
funk
whoa
caramel
malt
very
brown
sugar
a
lick
of
tart
cherry
or
raspberry
a
whiff
of
tobacco
and
just
a
bit
of
some
herbacious
hops
drying
the
edges
of
the
tongue
rich
but
less
complex
than
say
its
pot
brother
that
drying
helps
define
the
mouthfeel
too
by
cleaning
up
a
bit
of
chewiness
and
oiliness
in
the
body
dive
in
i
did
the
taste
is
divine
i
love
sweet
malty
brews
and
this
fits
completely
into
my
style
gorgeous
flavours
of
spices
yeast
and
those
sweet
dark
fruits
blend
together
giving
a
wonderfully
tasting
beer
that
belies
the
10
abv
it
stacks
full
bodied
and
a
really
lovely
night
cap
from
my
tasting
notes
this
is
a
huge
belgian
strong
ale
with
great
depth
and
complexity
it
had
a
malty
sweet
almost
brown
sugary
taste
with
notes
of
rich
caramel
and
dark
candied
fruits
it
had
a
medium
bodied
mouthfeel
and
hid
its
high
alcohol
content
really
well
it
was
a
great
gift
from
my
dad
as
de
struise
makes
world
class
beers
and
this
is
no
exception
as
a
standalone
beer
panepeut
seems
to
underdeliver
as
its
taste
falls
tarter
and
more
challenging
to
the
taste
paired
with
food
i
can
see
this
beer
singing
with
pickled
flavors
and
petite
beef
filet
this
is
solid
beer
enjoyment
o
another
very
nice
beer
from
this
series
i
probably
prefer
the
classic
version
but
this
is
really
tasty
as
well
bottom
line
near
legendary
o
not
the
best
quad
but
solid
dryer
than
usual
overall
another
fantastic
quad
from
de
struise
that
could
easily
be
mentioned
in
the
same
breath
as
the
likes
of
westvleteren
12
rochefort
10
and
st
bernardus
abt
12
this
is
the
only
vintage
ive
had
so
i
cant
compare
to
a
fresh
one
the
tangyness
was
more
than
expected
and
the
fruit
almost
overshadowed
the
malts
light
oxidation
was
and
added
to
the
overall
flavor
good
layering
with
a
tangy
fruit
twist
2010
330ml
bottle
o
definitely
a
complex
rich
and
powerful
quad
sweet
fruity
bitter
and
spicy
will
probably
be
awesome
if
aged
longer
was
expecting
more
o
in
my
opinion
a
great
representation
of
the
style
i
would
expect
nothing
less
from
this
brewery
excelsior
o
havent
had
a
5
year
old
quad
before
this
seems
like
it
cant
get
much
better
though
good
drinkability
abv
is
somewhat
hidden
smooth
and
medium
bodied
dark
fruits
spice
brown
sugar
and
alcohol
odamn
this
is
a
tasty
quad
i
dont
have
a
fresh
one
to
compare
with
but
this
beer
is
damn
near
perfect
right
now
equally
tasty
as
a
sipper
or
a
gulper
i
wish
i
had
more
of
this
beer
a
little
more
expensive
than
my
favorite
quad
st
bernardus
but
in
the
same
class
well
done
beer
that
brings
me
back
to
belgium
o
overall
an
excellent
quad
can
put
this
up
with
the
greats
of
the
style
and
it
would
fit
right
in
ive
liked
other
de
struise
beers
a
lot
more
than
i
like
this
one
its
not
bad
not
in
the
least
but
its
not
one
id
go
to
again
what
with
all
the
delicious
quads
that
are
readily
available
doesnt
give
me
anything
i
cant
find
elsewhere
good
by
quad
standards
kinda
average
for
a
pannepot
bottle
courtesy
of
bu11zeye
poured
a
deep
dirty
cloudy
brown
color
ale
with
a
large
foamy
head
with
great
retention
and
some
good
lacing
aroma
consists
of
bubblegum
ester
with
some
candi
sugar
and
some
light
spices
taste
is
comprised
of
a
sweet
malt
base
which
is
well
balance
with
some
bubblegum
ester
and
some
light
spicy
yeast
at
the
end
very
well
balance
with
no
apparent
alcohol
and
a
full
body
with
great
carbonation
i
thought
it
was
slightly
less
complex
then
the
regular
version
but
i
would
have
to
do
a
sidebyside
comparison
othis
is
surprisingly
no
where
near
as
awesome
as
the
oak
aged
version
its
definitely
an
awesome
beer
but
there
are
many
quads
out
there
id
rather
be
drinking
it
hits
pretty
hard
too
this
one
o
this
has
aged
spectacularly
rounded
and
complex
while
maintaining
a
great
drink
after
drink
simplicity
good
not
great
pannepot
is
far
superior
overall
eh
nothing
near
the
beer
that
pannepot
is
i
have
a
fresher
bottle
that
ill
try
i
dont
know
what
the
hell
some
of
the
other
reviewers
are
drinking
this
beer
is
incredibly
good
i
expected
to
be
dazzled
by
pannepot
but
this
one
caught
me
by
surprise
an
absolutely
phenomenal
beer
nice
quadrupel
that
is
a
great
representative
of
the
style
in
my
opinion
there
could
be
a
little
bit
more
of
fruity
aromas
that
could
balance
the
coffee
taste
great
beer
for
a
slow
evening
in
the
colder
seasons
which
means
practically
any
day
in
amsterdam
the
beer
is
dark
brown
and
fairly
hazy
with
an
inch
of
thick
foamy
tan
head
aromas
include
yeast
malt
caramels
figs
the
flavor
is
a
notch
better
alcohol
content
masterfully
hidden
really
creamy
and
smooth
on
the
palate
with
an
elegant
and
graceful
finish
cheers
to
urbain
the
body
is
medium
and
seems
to
have
very
little
carbonation
overall
this
one
is
fair
enough
not
my
favorite
variation
from
the
guys
d
the
winter
fruit
is
well
contained
and
doesnt
overpower
the
complexity
that
resonates
through
the
rest
of
the
drink
good
yeast
character
and
very
nice
feel
for
a
5
year
old
brew
o
this
was
a
decent
quad
i
definitely
preferred
the
pannepot
grand
reserva
i
had
a
month
ago
i
remember
that
having
a
less
dark
fruits
but
being
more
balanced
and
mellowed
out
this
beer
was
a
little
bit
too
grape
and
plum
heavy
for
my
tastes
and
tasted
too
much
like
merlot
which
sometimes
isnt
a
bad
thing
i
didnt
dislike
it
but
probably
wouldnt
buy
it
again
overall
an
enjoyable
sipper
im
not
sure
of
the
difference
if
this
were
a
pannepot
instead
of
the
pannepeut
that
it
was
the
label
indicates
a
danish
version
if
thats
the
difference
o
this
is
a
solidly
made
focused
and
drinkable
beer
overall
this
beer
was
good
not
the
best
in
its
style
but
drinkable
body
was
slightly
too
thin
for
the
style
in
my
opinion
flavors
were
just
off
the
mark
from
being
exceptional
liked
the
beer
but
dont
think
id
pay
another
8
bucks
for
it
o
overall
this
is
good
but
not
great
and
somewhat
disappointing
for
a
sytle
that
demands
excellence
this
is
the
3rd
pannepot
ive
had
the
pleasure
of
trying
others
being
regular
pannepot
old
fishermans
ale
11
and
pannepot
reserva
09
this
is
my
least
favorite
of
the
3
and
the
old
fishermans
was
by
far
my
favorite
of
the
three
as
a
whole
the
flavors
could
be
stronger
and
this
one
is
quite
boozy
perhaps
to
a
fault
maybe
im
just
spoiled
on
westy
and
rochefort
but
with
latter
being
so
much
better
than
this
offering
and
almost
always
readily
available
i
doubt
i
will
have
this
one
again
in
the
near
future
overall
tasted
side
by
side
with
a
2006
pannepot
and
this
one
came
up
way
short
the
carbonation
level
was
notably
lower
and
the
depth
of
dark
fruit
and
chocolate
flavors
was
missing
this
one
had
more
spice
cake
elements
and
was
a
tad
sweeter
overall
a
fantastic
quad
not
quite
as
good
as
rochefort
10
or
westvleteren
12
or
even
old
fishermans
by
the
same
brewery
but
its
very
very
good
a
must
try
for
quad
fans
unfortunately
they
just
dont
make
em
like
this
stateside
not
to
be
missed

o
this
is
a
truly
remarkable
experience
the
feel

this

alone
is
magical
the
decadence
of
this
beer
is
something
ive
never
experienced
ever
medium
bodied
with
average
carbonation
and
a
lightly
sweet

a
nice
beer
which
i
would
buy
again
pretty
good
a
complex

quad
that
lives
up
to
the
style
doesnt
quite
match
some
others
that
ive
tried
though
i
cant
pinpoint
why
orange
seems
to
come
through
in
the
flavour
and
the
alcoholic
notes
definitely
remind
me
of
dark
rum
all
said
a
solid
effort
that
is
well
worth
trying
overall
this
was
excellent
one
of
the
best
quads
ive
ever
tried
no
doubt
about
it
o
i
was
hoping
for
a
more
fullflavoured
brew
but
i
got
a
solid
effort
just
wish
it
was
less
expensive
a
malty
fruity
brew
thats
well
worth
trying
but
i
preferred
the
fishermans
ale
by
these
guys
thanks
again
liamt07
for
this
little
gem
o
a
good
quad
but
not
as
good
as
the
other
variations
its
a
bit
thinner
a
bit
boozier
and
not
as
complex
as
the
others
dark
fruits
are
probably
the
best
aspect
of
this
one
fully
warmed
up
its
nice
and
smooth
but
just
doesnt
quite
have
the
magic
poured
a
hazy

with
a
small
cap
of
offwhite

shortlived
but
moderate

left

taste

candispicy
yeast
dried

banana
notes
and
bready

pretty
boozy
but
not
too
offensive
though
it
does
detract
from
the
drinkability
a
bit
otherwise
medium
body
and
quite
good
overall
nice
to
see
it
on
tap
o
a
very
good
and
delicious
quad
may
not
have
as
many
flavors
as
other
quads
but
the
quality
of
the
dark
fruit
flavors
in
this
beer
are
amazing
very
clean
and
refreshing
which
is
weird
to
say
for
a
quad
overall
a
great
beer
again
i
may
have
a
little
bias
against
this
style
but
de
struise
just
exude
class
with
every
beer
they
make
highly
recommended
whether
one
enjoys
or
steers
clear
of
quads
normally
o
another
fine
pannepot
pannepeut
2011
on
the
label
brew
had
a
heartier
more
rumspiced
flavor
to
it
than
their
others
perhaps
a
bit
more
bold
perhaps
a
bit
more
like
an
old
alesotch
ale
meets
a
quad
id
say
any
beer
with
pannepot
on
the
label
is
golden
enjoy
cheers
not
quite
what
i
was
expecting
and
not
nearly
up
to
snuff
with
the
other
pannepot
products
ive
tired
but
still
nicely
brewed
and
well
worth
drinking
o
overall
the
reviews
call
this
one
out
as
a
weaker
link
and
id
have
to
agree
although
a
weak
link
from
one
of
the
masters
of
the
style
is
hardly
weak
this
is
an
extremely
tasty
and
enjoyable
beer
but
i
wont
be
reaching
for
this
over
regular
or
reserva
pannepot
but
would
reach
for
this
over
probably
80
to
90
of
all
other
options
b
not
sure
how
this
differs
from
pannepot
but
its
a
fine
beer
just
the
same
very
good
beer
nice
amount
of
complexity
good
dark
flavors
but
not
to
heavy
i
really
couldnt
even
detect
the
heat
from
the
alcohol
it
may
be
blasphemy
but
i
think
i
might
prefer
this
to
the
westy
12
o
another
solid
beer
from
de
struise
look
forward
to
trying
regular

at
some
point

i

half
curled

while
reading
please
make
sure
to
let
this
beer
warm
up
when
you
drink
it
i
had
it
in
my
aging
fridge
kept
at
55
degrees
when
i
poured
it
and
its
perfect
granted
quad
is
a
difficult
style
to
put
yourself
in
so
i
cant
give
it
more
than
a
4
0
but
its
delicious
o
really
flavorful
one
of
the
best
quads
ive
ever
had
thoroughly
enjoyable
medium

with
a
nice
balance
of
zesty
spice
earthy
hops
dark
fruit
sweet
malt
and
alcohol
hints
of
pepper
cinnamon
peppermint
and
clove
followed
by
a
strong
dark

character
hints
of
dark
cherry

raisin
before
a
slight
boozy
finish
some

flavor

not
much

high

relatively

just
a

beer
i
do
prefer

ill
gladly
take
this
any
day
thanks

it

note
2011

pretty
good
one
o
not
too
bad
an
easy
drinking
quad
o
my
biggest
letdown
from
struise
so
far
big
but
onedimensional
this
is
a
pretty
poor
excuse
for
a
quad
from
a
brewery
that
usually
excels
at
the
style
yeast
presence
is
minimal
and
uncomplicated
while
the
malt
adds
little
flavor
of
its
own
the
hops
that
are
so
prevalent
in
the
nose
are
nowhere
to
be
found
in
the
taste
id
expect
this
from
some
american
brewery
giving
it
a
try
for
the
first
time
but
not
from
these
guys
tomorrow
ill
sip

overall
a

sure
what

might
do
for
this
beer
but
not
something
i
feel
the
need
to
revisit
anytime
soon

are

as
well

some
cranberry
a
touch
of

they
mingle
well

offer
some

the
one

out
is
the

thin

night
this
one
does
the
trick
easy
drinking
a
bit
glad
its
in
a
smaller
bottle
really
expensive
for
my
enjoyment
level
o
in
my
opinion
this
is
an
excellent
belgian
quadrupel
it
is
probably
my
favorite
of
the
various
versions
of
pannepot
o
overall
a
pretty
good
beer
but
a
bit
disappointing
i
love
all
the
pannepøt
variationsbeers
that
de
struisse
makes
but
this
might
be
my
least
favorite
of
them
the
nose
was
nice
and
sweet
but
the
taste
was
a
bit
muted
and
musty
and
the
body
was
a
bit
thin
and
undercarbonated
by
no
means
a
bad
beer
but
no
where
near
the
other
pannepøts
o
delicious
easy
drinking
plenty
of
flavor
could
drink
this
all
night
jd
o
overall
this
was
right
up
my
alley
really
flavorful
caramel
malt
sweet
and
dark
fruit
rich
quad
nice
complexity
good
aroma
great
taste
really
nice
smooth
and
complex
quad
o
a
very
nice
and
superb
beer
worth
getting
a
crate
of

well
as

taste
is
packed
with

by

but
less
than
the
nose
implies

with
a

very
good

this
went
down
quickly
tons
of
flavour
in
here
this
really
works
and
is
a
testament
to
the
brilliance
of
the
de
struise
guys
the
way
the
malt
is
crafted
and
attenuated
is
really
nice
started
off
a
tad
disappointed
but
this
grew
on
me

some

pricey
at

99
for
a
330ml
bottle
from

liquors
westborough
ma
overall
what
really
does
it
for
me
is
the
mouthfeel
so
frothy
and
silky
along
with
the
subtle
complexities
in
an
otherwise
excellently
balanced
beer
o
this
is
a
good
beer
and
reminds
me
quite
a
bit
of
rigor
mortis
i
had
it
recently
so
its
more
on
the
memory
but
thats
a
good
comparison
id
say
this
beer
is
better
than
it
because
it
looks
better
and
has
a
better
mouthfeel
taste
is
very
close
to
it
in
both
cases
the
beer
is
nice
to
sip
and
just
enjoy
nothing
you
want
to
pound
down
just
sip
and
enjoy
the
different
flavors
pick
up
one
if
you
see
it
you
will
enjoy
it
poured
a
reddish
brown
with
a
great
thick
and
dense
mocha

great

and
some

is

and
i
got
some
dank
notes
intially
some
cinnamon
and
some
other
spice
notes
as
well
caramelized
dark
fruits
too
taste
has
some
dark

sugary

caramel
spicing
and
a
touch
of
the
herbal
note
found
in
the
nose
mouthfeel
is
sticky
and
the
herbal
note
is
found
in
the
finish
medium
heavy
medium
low
carbonation
and
a
bit
of
alcohol
quite
nice
but
these
herbal
notes
prevent
it
from
standing
out
for
me
o
great
there
really
isnt
much
more
to
say
other
then
go
find
this
beer
dark
fruits
are
prominent
on
the
palate
too
along
with
cola
and
faint
spice
slight
molasses
sweetness
roast
and
vinous
notes
come
through
midpalate
full
on
the
palate
though
it
drinks
easy
and
doesnt
have
a
trace
of
alcohol
the
finish
is
surprisingly
dry
after
the
initial
hit
of
sweetness
ending
with
a
lingering
spiciness
great
overall
im
impressed
yet
again
with
struise
o
this
is
a
very
nice
beer
but
it
feels
a
bit
harsh
due
to
the
strong
alcohol
presence
and
the
distracting
metallic
smell
and
taste
i
may
have
had
an
old
example
suffering
from
some
oxidation
without
the
metallic
overtone
id
rate
the
beer
much
higher
surprised
to
randomly
find
this
guy
on
tap
out
here
in
my
neck
o
the
woods
but
im
not
arguin
it
pours
a
murky
rubysienna
topped
by
a
finger
of
tan
foam
the
nose
is
somewhat
faint
yielding
some
brown
sugar
toffee
light
biscuit
and
light
red
grapes
when
some
effort
is
applied
via
my
strils
the
taste
holds
notes
of
brown
sugar
fig
red
apple
skin
red
grape
dark
fruit
light
clove
light
cinnamon
a
touch
of
banana
peel
and
a
vague
hint
of
honeydew
in
the
very
back
now
theres
some
complexity
folks
the
body
is
a
fairly
hefty
medium
with
a
light
moderate
carbonation
and
a
lightly
grainy
feel
overall
a
solid
brew
though
i
think
this
one
loses
out
to
the
normal
pannepot
which
has
a
brighter
nose
and
a
less
fruity
flavor
profile
which
sits
slightly
better
with
me
in
the
circumstances
still
a
very
good
beer
though
overall
an
enjoyable
beer
but
my
least
favourite
of
the
de
struisse
quads
that
i
have
had
got
better
as
it
warmed
came
in
the
glass
too
cold
full
body
slightly
higher
carbonation
sticky
and
warm
on
the
tongue
pretty
tasty
brew
but
still
a
bit
boozy
and
sweet
overall
im
glad
i
had
someone
to
help
me
finish
this
glass
as
drinking
12
oz
was
a
tad
difficult
an
interesting
take
from
de
struise
but
i
really
prefer
pannepot

into
chalice
garnet
brown
with
reddish
hue
and
very
unstable
tan
head
that
instantly
dissipates
complete
absence
of
lacing
does
not
add
positively
to
visual
aspects
of
the
beer
the
reviewed
beer
belongs
to
pannepøt
the
cane
sugar
based
variant
hence
the
poor
head
retention
is
not
surprising
as
cane
sugar
is
supposedly
inferior
to
candi
sugar
that
adds
to
a
beers
head
retention
aromas
are
of
chocolate
coated
dark
fruit
dried
cherries
prunes
sugar
and
spicy
alcohol
flavor
dept
consists
of
chocolate
covered
dry
cherries
prunes

and
bread
crust
bitter
finish
counteracting
the
sweetened
fruity
tartness
medium
bodied
with
just
about
the
right
amount
of
carbonation
the
beer
is
almost
prickly
but
never
such
similar
to
but
thinner
than
regular
pannepot
lacking
its
fullness
smoothness
and
visual
appearance
o
great
beer
but
not
the
best
of
this

struise

an
amazing
masterpiece
i
dont
know
a
word
of
danish
and
few
flemish

for
that
matter
but
apparently
we
all
speak
the
same
language
good
beer
is
good
beer
while
i
like
others
wouldnt
consider
the
danish
export
quite
as
grandiose
as
the
original
it
is
nearly
every
bit
as
sensuous
and
it
makes
every
bit
as
good

like
the

better

this
was
a
fine
treat
during
a
dull

recommended
well
i
love
the
normal
pannepot
and
had
high
hopes
for
this
version
and
have
been
waiting
quite
some
time
to
try
it
and
needless
to
say
am
a

let

see
what
happens
outstanding
beer
just
like
everything
else
ive
had
from
struise
compared
to
the
standard
pannepot
i
feel
that
this
beer
is
maltier
and
slightly
less
complex
but
nevertheless
awesome
overall
essentially
this
brew
is
pannepot
without
the
added
spices
and
herbs
though
pannepeut
is
a
nice
beer
on
its
own
right
i
dont
think
it
even
compares
to
its
superior
and
betterknown
brother
in
terms
of
complexity
and
enjoyment
this
is
one
i
would
have
again
but
would
reach
for
the
regular
pannepot
nine
times
out
of
ten
worth
checking
out
to
make
up
your
own
mind
if
you
get
the
chance
a
very
nice
brew
overall
notes
im
surprised
somewhat
by
the
pannepot
and
pannepøt
the
former
smells
duller
and
is
more
spry
on
the
palate
while
the
latter
has
a
more
bright
nose
but
is
dull
on
the
palate
my
least
favorite
of
the
three
tasted
surprising
because
i
like
the
nose
the
best
on
this

the

did

do
he
even
said
its

so
that
made

this

just
did

me
this
is
my
first
beer
have
had
by
this

and
i
am
not

impressed
i
wish
i
could
have
tried
this
beer
fresh
to
get
a
better
idea
of
what
its
all
about
it
talks
on
the
label
about
an
ale
thats
brewed
with
spices
and
i
get
no
hints
of
spices
or
any
spicyness
from
this

not
even
a

i

one
thing
for

it

good
the

strikes
me
immediately
as
being
pretty
light
on
the
dark

with
more
caramel

coming
through
aside
from
that
a
spicy
character
takes
over
and
really
sends
a

along

with

spiciness
to
form
a

nicely
done
struise
a
treat
to
be
sure

its
also
a

from

into
a
trappistes

chalice
poured
a
deep
reddish
brown
with
a
half
finger
light
tan
head
that
subsided
to
a
minimal
amount
slowly
maintained
phenomenal
lacing
throughout
the
glass
the
aroma
was
comprised
of
sweet
malt
dark
chocolate
dark
fruit
and
sweet
alcohol
the
flavor
was
of
sweet
malt
dark
chocolate
bread
raisins
and
sweet
alcohol
on
the
followthrough
it
had
a
heavy
feel
on
the
palate
with
mild
carbonation
overall
this
was
a
pretty
good
brew
the
alcohol
on
this
one
definitely
made
itself
present
on
the
followthrough
without
doubt
hard
to
believe
that
with
this
one
having
4
years
on
it
already
definitely
worth
trying
if
you
get
the
chance
this
is
a
medium
to
full
bodied
offering
with
a
distractingly
excessive
amount
of
carbonation
just
looking
at
the
glass
you
can
see
the
carbonation
is
too
high
even
continual
sips
and
swirls
does
not
tame
how
much
carbonation
this
has
once
it
enters
your
mouth
it
really
fizzes
and
tingles
the
tongue
this
brew
is
quite
complex
but
in
an
unusual
way
the
good
parts
about
this
brew
are
really
good
however
the
seemingly
off
or
distracting
flavors
are
not
subtle
and
they
clash
with
the
pleasant
characteristics
of
this
brew
perhaps
i
should
say
shame
on
me
for
opening
this
too
soon
however
i
wanted
to
get
my
own
experience
at
having
this
brew
both
fresh
and
with
age
on
it
so
while
this
bottle
was
an
interesting
experience
i
am
curious
to
see
how
this
brew
either
improves
or
goes
down
hill

smooth
never
short
of
microscopic
fizz
fullbodied
but
not
overflowing
this
strong
quadrupel
is
rich
in
flavour
but
so
smooth
and
balanced
on
the
palate
so
much
so
that
i
kindof
feel
like
having
a
second
bottle
almost
without
considering
the
alc
strength
or
how
expensive
it
comes
a
superblycrafted
strong
ale
overall
not
with
heavenly
complexity
but
not
far
from
it
either
the
body
is
thick
something
like
st
bernardus
abt
thickness
which
matches
well
with
the
massive
flavors
the
noticeable
alcohol
makes
this
a
sipper
a
very
good
one

i
think
i
like
the
standard
pannepot
better

i
was
thinking
this
was
some
pannepot
even
though
jeff
told
me
there
werent
any
belgians
in
this
box
i
love
all
the
pannepot
variations
this
came
off
as
a
belgian
winter
warmer
to
me
the
spice
was
a
nice
but
somewhat
overpowering
mix
of
cinnamon
and
sweet
herbs
the
malty
belgian
beer
in
the
background
was
pretty
faint
but
still
provided
a
pretty
nice
background
with
a
bit
of
fig
i
can
say
this
beer
was
very
drinkable
and
quite
nice
but
not
worth
the
8
price
tag
d
what
a
surprising
let
down
i
thoroughly
enjoyed
pannepot
so
i
thought
this
would
be
more
of
the
same
you
cant
win
em
all
overall
great
beer
not
too
much
difference
with
the
regular
pannepot
to
be
honest
bit
more
sweet
maybe
odont
taste
much
of
a

this

nearly

in

its
also
held
up
pretty
well
after
five
years
but
i
wouldnt
sit
on
these
much
longer
while
each
of

variants
is
clearly
different

they
all
share
fairly

for

almost
champagne
like
i
pick
up
the

taste
pretty
easily
fruity
type
tastes
as
well
i
can
appreciate
the
style
but
this
beer
just
had
too
light
of
a
mouthfeel
for
me
overall
i
thought
this
version
was
boozier
than
the
american
version
which
hurt
the
drinkability
a
bit
but
the
best
part
of
either
version
is
the
smooth
mouthfeel
well
worth
a
shot
if
you
have
the
chance
as
is
the
american
version
d
best
quad
ive
ever
drank
i
havent
had
that
many
but
still
at
10
this
would
hit
you
hard
after
a
few
whatever
its
lineageprovenancerecipe
this
is
a
unique
and
tasty
example
of
the
style
mouthfeel
is
smooth
with
spot
on
carbonation
goes
down
pretty
easy
considering
the
abv
overall
another
tasty
brew
from
struise
and
one
im
glad
i
picked
up
wish
i
had
another
lying
around
d
formidable
at
10
small
sips
a
nice
licquerstyle
beer
d
absolutely
world
class
so
complex
and
layered
yet
so
easy
to
drink
one
of
the
best
drinkability
very
good
excellent
beer
almost
at
the
intersection
of
a
quad
and
a
stout
d
fairly
drinkable
for
10
very
smooth
which
helps
but
still
a
very
big
beer
overall
this
is
a
very
unique
quad
and
very
delicious
will
most
likely
revisit
opens
sweet
with
a
touch
of
metallic
character
that
disappears
after
a
while
fairly
simple
theres
a
lot
of
brown
sugar
and
honey
with
alcohol
being
a
lot
more
noticeable
rummy
and
fruity
this
finishes
mediumdry
with
a
touch
of
alcohol
and
spices
mediumlight
in
body
this
is
sweeter
than
i
care
for
fruity
and
tasty
on
the
finish
i
cant
help
but
notice
that
the
higher
carbonation
in
this
version
results
in
this
not
being
as
creamy
as
the
regular
version
splitting
this
beer
is
pretty
much
necessary
and
im
glad
i
got
to
try
this
probably
my
least
favorite
of
the
pannepot
incarnations
but
thats
a
moot
point
considering
how
great
they
all
are
as
i
mentioned
above
id
like
to
try
this
with
a
few
more
years
on
it
i
do
love
me
some
well
aged
quads
o
not
a
bad
beer
had
great
aroma
but
a
very
different
taste
for
the
price
would
probably
not
buy
again
the
tartness
in
the
flavor
threw
me
on
this
one
didnt
seem
to
compliment
the
beer
at
first
i
was
unsure
of
this
beer
but
eventually
the
sour
notes
got
to
me
and
i
really
started
to
not
enjoy
it
ill
stick
to
the
regular
pannepot
2006
bottle
this
dark
brown
ale
pours
with
a
thickness
that
informs
the
imbiber
this
is
some
serious
stuff
nice
though
small
head
with
an
unctuous
mouthfeel
of
molasses
caramel
and
baking
spices
i
could
envision
myself
being
an
old
fisherman
getting
off
the
boat
after
a
long
cold
day
at
sea
and
knocking
back
a
few
flagons
of
this
to
slake
my
thirst
excellent
stuff
will
drink
more
definitely
drinkable
despite
its
10
alcohol
although
the
spices
get
to
be
a
bit
much
after
awhile
2006

pours
a
rich

was
expecting
more
from

to

sticks
to

cheers
d
fuck
yeah
this
is
an
enjoyable
beer
which
makes
a
great
winter
warmer
i
liked
the
regular
pannepot
just
a
bit
more
but
wouldnt
hesitate
to
have
this
one
again
d
tasty
goes
down
ok
not
very
filling
strong
kick
good
representation
of
style
its
a
decent
high
strength
belgian
beer
to
drink
for
a
while
i
could
drink
this
all
night
or
maybe
even
forever
im
a
sucker
for
a
good

this
is

the

works
with
this

the

of
the

doesnt
seem
to
be

thick
an

as
the

i
had
the
other

this
is
still
a
very

is
good

the

i
would
drink

over

at

for

this

one

ive
had
probably
the

it

some

tartness
very
different

creamy
texture
to
this

it

is
very
high
since
im
absolutely
loving
this
beer
although
its
one
of
my
favorite
styles
better
then
the
regular
version
iirc
although
ive
only
had
it
once
about
a
month
ago
ok
this
beer
is
not
as
good
as
its
denmarkfree
version
pannepot
but
its
still
really
good

enjoyed
it

you

you
like

very

great
taste
everything
comes
together
very
well
id
also
say
this
one
is
a
great
candidate
for
some
ageing
very
interesting
to
compare
to
the
belgian
version
pours
a
murky

with
a

that
quickly
disappears
very
little

sherry
like
nose
with
dry
vinous
and
slightly
oaklike
aromas
some
sweet
malt
on
the
finish
as
well
as
raisins
the
taste
is
somewhat
similar
but
there
is
a
much
richer
fruitiness
with
prunes
chocolate
and
dark
cherries
added
into
the
flavor
profile
sherry
like

is
still
there

with
a
hint
of
sweetness
at
the
very
end
quite
nice
mouthfeel
is
smooth
substantial
and
creamy
the
alcohol
is
clearly
there
but
not
in
an
overpowering
way
not
quite
as
rich
as
some
quads
or
as
sweet
more
like
an
amontillado
to
the
others
oloroso
but
still
quite
enjoyable
for
its
own
style

2
oz
bottle
pours
a
murky
deep
brown
color
with
a
very
bubbly
tan
head
over
top
that
falls
to
a
full
coat
clarity
is
fairly
good
on
this
one
and
there
are
tons
of
tiny
bubbles
cascading
up
and
helping
keep
the
head
around
the
nose
on
this
one
is
nice
and
raisiny
with
a
blast
of
spicy
yeast
that
reminds
me
of
cinnamon
followed
by
a
deep
and
sweet
candied
sugar
sweetness
taking
a
very
deep
inhale
over
top
brings
me
a
solid
yeasty
breadyness
at
the
end
this
one
is
very
aromatic
with
the
sweet
malty
and
sugary
notes
playing
the
staring
role
my
first
sip
brings
a
more
subdued
flavor
than
i
would
have
expected
i
find
a
mild
raisin
fruit
with
a
very
mild
caramel
and
sugar
sweetness
behind
it
there
is
a
mild
banana
fruityness
playing
in
the
background
along
with
a
niticable
yeasty
character
that
imparts
a
breadyness
mouthfeel
is
thick
with
a
very
mild
carbonation
this
one
has
no
slickness
as
i
would
expect
from
the
strong
sugary
aroma
it
is
very
smooth
the
only
hint
of
the
abv
i
find
in
this
one
is
the
slight
drying
quality
on
the
finish
i
enjoy
the
strong
aromatic
component
and
very
solid
flavor
but
more
subdued
from
the
original
version
i
enjoy
this
one
quite
a
bit
i
am
not
sure
of
the
difference
between
pannepot
and
pannepøt
but
they
are
certainly
different
this
beer
seems
to
be
a
touch
sweeter
and
not
nearly
as
aromatically
fruity
as
pannepot
ill
definitely
have
to
do
a
side
by
side
of
these
two
to
explore
them
a
bit
more
in
depth
as
the
beer
warms
up
it
loses
a
touch
of
sweetness
yet
strangely
notes
of
brown
sugar
and
even
molasses
become
evident
still
that
woody
almost
peat
like
spiciness
is
quite
noticeable
and
it
starts
to
mix
in
with
a
touch
of
warming
alcohol
towards
the
finish
definitely
another
really
tasty
offering
from
the
struis
brouwers
i
cant
wait
to
crack
my
bottle
of
aardmonnik
overall
a
very
well
crafted
beer
that
i
enjoyed
immensly
tasty
very
nutty
and
malty
some
black
currant
and
prunes
lighter
than
its
cousin
and
decidedly
less
spicy
ill
have
to
revisit
the
belgian
version
again
the
1st
time
was
a
little
overwhelming
primary
aroma
of
dark
malt
vague
sweetness
moderately
fullbodied
what
you
would
expect
from
a
quad
lighter
than
others
of
the
style
though
reccommended
in
a
side
by
side
pairing
with
its
counterparts
interesting
and
worth
a
try
this
is
a
very
good
beer
but
for
the
same
money
ill
stick
to
the
regular
bottling
although
i
recommend
it
i
prefer
and
more
strongly
recommend
the
belgium
version
of
the
same
beer
not
bad
but
not
great
creamy
medium
body
beer
with
good
carbonation
very
enjoyable
if
you
see
it
pick
it
up
i
will
be
coming
back
to
this
one
this
beer
is
somehow
a
dane
version
of
the
previous
one
i
had
it
poured
just
as
dark
with
the
dark
amber
hints
but
more
light
shone
through
this
one
a
off
white
bubbly
head
formed
and
coated
the
sides
with
lace
as
it
subsided
the
aroma
was
of
malt
chocolate
and
while
molasses
and
the
other
aromas
where
there
like
the
last
one
not
as
pronounced
a
flavor
of
malt
chocolate
and
molasses
the
finish
was
sweet
and
less
sprite
then
the
non
dane
one
for
the
most
part
quite
similar
except
in
the
aroma
and
the
finish
the
beer
has
a
very
dark
color
almost
black
with
a
beige
head
aroma
of
spices
fruit
plums
raisins
and
a
little
smell
of
wine
these
aromas
reappear
in
the
taste
combined
with
some
hints
of
chocolate
and
coffee
and
a
little
smoke
in
the
afterstaste
you
can
really
taste
that
this
beer
is
matured
in
wine
and
calvados
barrels
but
all
these
different
tastes
are
so
well
balanced
which
makes
it
a
top
class
beer
i
had
this
beer
at
la
capsule
in
france
trully
amazing
beer
also
had
it
in
bottle
incredible
complexity
very
close
to
perfection
2008
bottle
opened
in
2014
this
is
brief
because
i
did
not
have
access
to
the
internet
at
the
time
of
opening
past
its
prime
but
wonderful
and
interesting
intricate
flavors
in
harmony
and
rather
subdued
i
bought
this
bottle
in
belgium
at
a
shop
in
brussels
this
is
fing
awesom
im
glad
i
got
a
lot
of
bottles
to
my
beercellar
holy
great
10year
old
aged
beer
this
must
have
been
properly
cellared
because
this
was
a
nice
smooth
balanced
beer
the
feel
of
this
beer
was
particularly
surprising
silky
smooth
with
a
nice
tingly
carbonation
cant
wait
for
bottle
2
overall
fantastic
quad
the
best
that
i
ever
have
had
absolutely
delicious
smell
and
flavor
great
feel
i
could
drink
this
over
and
over
i
want
more
firkin
deelursh
2005
tastes
of
rubber
and
oxidization
this
tastes
like
latex
baloons
overall
this
is
fantastic
better
than
reserva
and
quite
possibly
better
than
the
best
standard
pannepot
that
ive
had
the
use
of
calvados
barrels
as
a
finish
is
what
really
elevates
this
higher
than
the
standard
oak
aged
great
wine
grapeplum
and
rum
flavors
that
arent
as
prominent
in
the
reserva
hope
i
can
find
more
of
this
ive
never
had
this
bottle
fresh
but
9
years
has
seemed
to
do
well
for
this
beer
the
apple
notes
really
separate
it
from
other
quads
out
there
i
would
definitely
pick
up
another
bottle
of
this
to
see
how
a
fresher
vintage
is
hauled
this
2009
bottle
back
from
bruges
belgium
pours
dark
brown
in
my
glass
with
some
purple
showing
in
the
edges
where
the
light
comes
through
small
off
white
head
that
disappears
pretty
quickly
aroma
of
dark
fruits
figs
plums
light
molasses
and
even
chocolate
candi
sugar
flavor
is
sweet
plums
and
figs
molasses
brown
sugar
light
chocolateyness
and
a
smooth
nuttiness
from
the
barrel
age
showing
a
bit
here
with
some
oxidization
going
on
thick
body
low
plus
carbonation
really
rich
and
palate
coating
nice
beer
but
would
like
to
try
one
a
bit
fresher
as
this
wasnt
nearly
the
level
of
reserva
or
even
the
regular
version
still
yummy
though
which
speaks
to
how
good
those
are
o
i
had
an
08
grand
reserva
and
was
blown
away
while
this
is
good
i
think
rochefort
10
is
better
its
odd
what
one
single
year
would
do
to
the
taste
this
is
a
good
quad
but
i
was
a
little
surprised
with
the
light
harshness
of
alcohol
overall
a
very
pleasant
quad
o
a
beer
to
be
had
on
special
occasions
but
mainly
for
winter
and
on
snowy
nights
almost
couldnt
believe
i
saw
this
on
the
shelf
1010
would
buy
again
its
long
and
decadent
finish
is
slow
to
release
as
its
sweetness
gently
rolls
off
the
palate
its
brandy
head
builds
and
those
apple
influences
take
hold
slight
numbing
warmth
and
wood
spices
give
a
soft
dryness
to
the
otherwise
savory
dessert
beer
i
think
this
would
have
been
a
very
fine
beer
in
its
prime
i
recently
had
a
2010
reserva
that
rocked
my
world
this
is
a
shell
of
that
beer
i
am
giving
extra
points
to
the
overall
score
given
that
opening
any
beer
at
this
age
is
a
crapshoot
and
that
pannepot
has
not
disappointed
me
in
the
past
pours
a
clear
dark
brown
with
a
foamy
khaki
head
that
settles
to
a
partial
film
on
top
of
the
beer
small
dots
of
lace
form
around
the
glass
on
the
drink
down
smell
is
of
toasted
malt
caramel
candied
fruit
and
slight
cardboard
aromas
taste
is
much
the
same
with
candied
fruit
caramel
and
slight
cardboard
flavors
on
the
finish
there
is
a
mild
amount
of
earth
bitterness
on
the
palate
with
each
sip
this
beer
has
a
lower
level
of
carbonation
with
a
slightly
crisp
mouthfeel
overall
this
is
a
pretty
good
beer
that
seems
a
bit
old
and
oxidized
at
this
point
but
its
still
fairly
tasty
as
is
old
yes
but
still
drinking
well
imo
sophie
marceau
aging
but
still
plenty
well
put
together
o
overall
perhaps
i
should
have
drank
this
a
few
years
back
but
still
glad
i
did
not
nice
complexity
here
vintage
05
on
the
bottle
pour
is
deep
brown
with
a
tight
tan
head
nose
has
a
ton
of
rich
dark
malt
figs
brown
sugar
red
grapes
a
bit
oxidized
nutty
cardboard
and
boozy
notes
in
back
taste
is
also
a
good
bit
oxidized
the
cardboard
is
strong
with
the
rich
malt
being
faded
brown
sugar
and
fig
with
booze
in
back
the
cardboard
lingers
through
the
finish
medium
to
full
body
fairly
good
carbonation
overall
this
definitely
has
its
drawbacks
the
oxidation
doesnt
open
up
any
exciting
flavors
its
not
too
old
but
its
old
nonetheless
this
is
a
fantastic
and
complex
beer
od
this
is
probably
a
bit
oxidized
but
still
pretty
enjoyable
the
aroma
is
quite
original
and
enjoyable
with
lots
of
complexity
you
can
tell
that
there
was
a
world
class
quad
underneath
this
but
maybe
it
peaked
a
few
years
ago
still
pretty
darn
good
though
oincredible
calvados
is
there
but
light
drink
it
now
before
the
barre
disappears
o
a
little
disappointed
with
this
beer
not
enough
oaky
flavours
and
considering
its
so
hard
to
get
i
wouldnt
bother
o
a
thought
provoking
beer
o
not
bad
overall
the
aroma
is
still
incredible
and
there
are
a
lot
of
good
flavors
in
there
but
this
beer
is
certainly
over
the
hill
by
now
im
not
gonna
ding
it
too
hard
on
the
score
though
because
i
can
tell
how
good
this
used
to
be
need
to
get
a
fresher
bottle
of
this
asap
with
all
the
excitement
over
the
westyv12
it
was
a
good
time
to
try
this
on
draft
and
i
found
a
new
favorite
this
has
the
power
of
an
ancient
quad
the
wine
fruit
scent
and
the
deep
dark
earthy
tastes
that
just
gets
better
as
it
warms
up
my
new
all
time
best
beer
of
any
style
could
drink
this
exclusively
if
suddenly
the
rest
of
the
world
forgot
all
their
beer
recipes
and
all
you
could
drink
was
this
sorry
i
cannot
include
more
descriptive
terms
like
steak
mushrooms
and
biscuits
but
if
you
get
the
idea
that
this
beer
is
awesome
i
have
said
enough
top
3
beer
ive
ever
had
hands
down
i
swore
id
reviewed
this
one
in
the
past
but
apparently
not
im
curious
what
this
tasted
like
a
couple
years
ago
i
dont
think
id
age
this
one
beyond
this
point
drink
em
if
you
got
em
thanks
to
merc7186
for
this
one
o
a
solid
beer
if
not
as
good
as
its
brother
worth
a
shot
but
im
not
sure
if
this
is
better
fresh
overall
very
nice
drinks
way
too
easy
for
what
should
be
a
big
sipper
this
is
as
smooth
a
quad
as
you
will
ever
be
able
to
find
im
letting
it
warm
up
a
bit
to
see
if
some
additional
character
comes
out
on
it
but
there
are
some
matured
wood
tones
with
the
calvados
peeking
through
well
sometimes
it
seems
a
bit
more
than
just
peeking
through
apple
tones
can
be
there
pretty
clearly
this
is
as
easydrinking
for
a
quad
as
its
gonna
get
a
real
nice
production
overall
so
glad
to
have
another
to
sip
later
im
amassing
a
vertical
and
this
shaped
up
to
be
the
early
favorite
o
of
the
three
this
was
hands
down
my
favorite
the
beauty
and
depth
of
this
beer
is
unique
wonderful
and
amazing
age
has
down
wonders
to
this
beer
and
i
think
it
will
get
better
in
due
time
nice
work
urbain
bravo
o
this
was
a
very
good
beer
with
lots
of
complexity
there
was
so
much
going
on
in
this
that
it
was
hard
to
distinguish
all
of
the
different
aromas
and
tastes
with
all
the
complexity
it
still
was
very
well
balanced
and
drank
very
easily
one
of
my
favorite
belgians
ive
had
to
date
definitely
recommend
trying
it
now
i
wish
i
could
compare
it
to
the
other
pannepots
o
a
very
nice
quad
wonderful
cherry
flavors
that
are
mixed
with
some
good
chocolate
smooth
and
beautiful
simply
superb
i
have
had
this
one
once
before
for
me
a
truly
amazing
quad
i
really
enjoy
the
subtle
acidic
quality
that
the
barrel
aging
has
given
this
one
especially
as
it
pairs
with
the
dark
fruit
flavors
of
the
original
pannepot
o
has
held
up
quite
well
happy
to
have
one
other
to
drink
slowly
getting
back
into
quads
and
this
helps
the
cause
a
lot
well
hidden
alcohol
and
just
a
well
balanced
beer
o
a
wonderful
quad
im
glad
i
bought
multiples
of
this
as
it
is
really
a
special
beer
glad
to
get
to
try
it
picked
this
up
at
my
favorite
beer
store
in
belgium
dranken
geers
2008
vintage
deep
dark
brown
nearly
black
pour
with
one
finger
tan
head
with
minimal
retention
but
nice
lacing
somewhat
subdued
nose
initially
but
it
comes
alive
as
it
warms
very
complex
and
dominated
by
dark
fruit
with
hints
of
cherry
vanilla
caramel
and
oak
with
just
a
touch
of
chocolate
the
taste
is
complex
as
well
but
definitely
dominated
by
the
wood
hints
of
dark
fruit
specifically
figs
cherry
tobacco
brown
sugar
espresso
vanilla
and
just
a
bit
of
cinnamon
and
chocolate
it
has
a
subtle
vinous
character
to
it
and
tons
of
wood
with
a
perfect
amount
of
sweetness
the
mouthfeel
is
slightly
syrupy
but
very
smooth
and
surprisingly
drinkable
for
a
10
beer
this
is
definitely
my
favorite
pannepot
and
yet
another
winner
from
de
struise
a
great
beer
for
those
who
love
them
aged
in
wood
o
tasty
quad
much
like
the
other
variations
i
feel
this
is
the
worst
of
the
bunch
though
not
as
good
as
the
reserva
which
isnt
as
good
as
the
normal
one
a
little
too
much
oak
a
little
too
boozy
compared
to
the
others
not
bad
by
any
means
of
course
once
it
warms
up
fully
i
swear
it
becomes
a
different
beer
i
had
to
adjust
my
taste
score
to
a
4
5
the
cocoa
comes
out
and
it
just
balances
perfectly
warm
interesting
might
have
to
retest
the
regular
and
reserva
versions
now
o
i
loved
the
pannepot
2011
and
2007
ive
had
and
this
was
every
bit
as
good
as
id
hoped
tip
when
opening
this
reserve
ale
i
highly
recommend
thinking
more
wine
than
beer
this
may
help
contribute
to
a
better
experience
overall
the
beer
boasts
a
dark
pour
with
a
slight
off
white
head
dark
fruits
some
roast
candied
sugar
belgian
yeasts
are
all
noted
for
aromas
it
smells
very
mellow
and
balanced
the
taste
is
basically
aged
to
perfection
balanced
and
mellow
this
beer
focuses
on
roast
and
mellowed
booze
very
sweet
with
candied
sugar
and
caramel
all
blending
together
perfectly
its
so
smooth
no
harsh
booze
no
misplaced
flavors
just
delicious
and
wonderfully
drinkable
best
beer
of
the
night
by
far
my
god
it
was
good
o
this
beer
really
became
special
right
around
room
temperature
the
flavor
and
mouthfeel
in
particular
while
i
enjoyed
this
beer
quite
a
bit
i
was
hoping
for
a
little
more
the
taste
gained
a
half
point
during
the
second
half
of
the
glass
which
had
a
pretty
profound
impact
on
its
rating
went
from
4
0
to
4
23
overall
i
like
this
quad
i
appreciate
the
fruity
flavours
but
ive
had
better
quads
id
love
to
pick
up
a
normal
pannepot
to
compare
ti
with
though

so

great

that

awesome
fantastic
spectacular
one
of
the
best
ever
o
overall
another
winner
but
for
my
tastes
i
think
i
prefer
the
straight
pannepot
over
the
reservas
the
grand
reserva
definitely
adds
layers
of
complexity
to
an
already
amazing
beer
very
brandy
and
sangria
like
really
well
done
beer
ive
come
to
have
high
expectations
on
everything
struise
i
try
and
ive
yet
to
be
dissappointed
o
good
stuff
glad
to
have
gotten
a
bottle
alcohol
becomes
a
little
more
prevalent
as
i
work
my
way
down
the
glass
detracts
from
drinkability
a
bit
still
good
stuff
a
nice
sipper
as
it
warms
and
the
booze
steps
up
i
was
lucky
enough
to
recieve
this
in

poured

however
the

there
is
also
a

of

in

as
some
metallic

a

i
cant

that
i
really
pick
up
any
of
the

that
said
at
the

point
this

comes
in
at
i
would
have
to
say
that
st
bernardus
abt
12
is
still
the
way
to
go
this
was
vintage
2005
has
most
probably
peeked
a
while
ago
pannepot
grand
reserva
2005
goes
in
the
glass
a
medium
hue
of
brown
with
some
tree
bark
like
colors
the
cap
is
real
thin
with
dark
tannish
film
like
appearance
smell
is
old
dark
fruit
with
plum
being
the
focus
faint
sour
apple
with
some
faded
roasted
malt
scent
some
port
like
quality
with
grape
and
small
fig
cant
really
pick
up
the
barrel
this
is
an
old
bottle
here
taste
is
way
left
field
at
this
point
perhaps
past
the
point
of
no
return
dark
fruit
and
some
tartness
has
taken
on
effect
its
different
and
pleasant
but
not
what
im
looking
for
in
a
quad
plum
and
some
apple
with
grape
sour
grapes
port
like
flavors
calvados
this
is
far
off
from
a
normal
quad
feel
is
a
big
medium
and
the
carb
is
tame
yet
this
leaves
a
tart
zing
when
sipped
i
vastly
preferred
the
pannepot
reserva
to
this
grand
version
perhaps
i
should
try
another
bottle
of
it
a
beer
with
an
extraordinary
smell
sadly
the
taste
feels
a
bit
tired
and
old
4
0
d
good
beer
but
i
cant
say
that
i
think
all
the
extra
stuff
has
made
the
regular
any
better
not
sure
anything
will
ever
compare
with
2006
pannepot
for
me
but
this
is
still
a
nice
beer
spices
sort
of
take
over
a
bit
too
much
as
i
go
on
cheers
this
is
certainly
a
rich
and
robust
belgian
ale
the
oak
certainly
penetrates
the
beer
and
the
malt
character
is
very
prominent
too
overall
a
nice
one
to
find
on
tap
the
pannepot
offerings
never
seem
to
disappoint
d
a
magnificent
brew
not
drastically
different
from
pannepot
although
the
grand
reserva
has
a
more
noticeable
sour
edge
from
recollection
but
that
certainly
isnt
a
bad
thing
11242011
overall
another
excellent
struise
brew
definitely
recommended
o
a
great
beer
that
is
very
easy
to
enjoy
at
first
i
thought
the
little
tartness
was
oxidation
but
on
the
second
and
third
sip
i
was
able
to
place
it
as
tart
fruits
not
oxidation
i
really
hope
i
am
able
to
stock
up
on
this
very
happy
that
i
was
able
to
find
this
didnt
quit
knock
my
socks
off
but
it
definitely
impressed
me
i
was
expecting
more
barrel
qualities
in
the
aroma
and
flavor
but
it
seems
the
quadruple
aspects
of
the
beer
managed
to
take
precedence
atmosphere
is
pretty
solid
nice
dark
appearance
with
a
decent
head
nose
is
roasted
woody
malt
flavor
has
a
hearty
roasted
coffee
feel
with
a
bittersweet
finish
o
the
complexity
is
excellent
and
i
imagine
will
become
deeper
in
flavor
as
the
beer
temperature
rises
wow
quite
disappointing
the
regular
pannepot
is
one
of
my
favorite
beers
and
the
reserva
is
great
as
well
this
really
didnt
do
much
for
me
flavor
is
way
too
faint
o
i
really
liked
this
beer
but
not
sure
its
worth
10bottle
o
i
really
like
this
a
lot
the
flavors
have
developed
well
over
the
last
six
years
overall
this
beer
was
a
nice
and
new
experience
for
me
i
usually
do
not
like
belgian
ales
aged
in
barrels
but
the
brandy
barrels
work
here
and
add
a
new
dynamic
to
the
already
amazing
base
pannepot
do
i
like
it
more
than
the
original
i
dont
think
so
but
is
it
still
heads
and
tail
above
95
of
quads
on
the
market
yes
definitely
recommended
and
well
worth
seeking
out
for
quad
fans
and
fans
of
wellintegrated
barrel
aged
beers
very
good
ive
never
had
a
quad
aged
this
much
it
mellowed
it
and
absorbed
all
sugar
and
focused
the
brew
bitter
unrelenting
brew
and
for
all
of
the
hard
flavors
i
find
this
oddly
drinkable
this
is
not
for
beginners
either
in
flavor
or
price
but
very
worthy
very
easy
drinking
for
10
definatly
one
of
the
best
quads
ive
had
such
a
nice
melding
of
flavors
age
has
done
this
well
id
be
a
little
hesitant
to
buy
more
because
of
the
huge
price
tag
for
one
11
2
oz
bottle
but
id
be
very
interested
to
see
what
further
cellaring
could
do
note
2005
vintage
this
beer
was
quite
overpriced
but
still
tasty
i
would
have
liked
to
grab
a
4
pack
of
3
philosophers
and
allow
it
to
age
a
couple
years
instead
worth
tasting
and
i
grabbed
a
few
for
down
the
road
so
well
see
what
happens
this
is
a
nearly
perfect
quadpick
this
up
if
you
can
find
it
this
is
a
very
complex
beer
belgian
yeast
sugar
and
alcohol
are
all
present
this
beer
is
a
sipper
but
very
easy
to
drink
i
am
glad
we
picked
up
a
few
of
these
in
belgium
i
will
hopefully
get
the
chance
to
enjoy
one
or
two
more
overall
very
smooth
a
bit
more
bitter
than
i
expected
but
that
wasnt
a
problem
very
complex
would
definitely
have
another
o
overall
very
similar
to
the
base
beer
as
is
reserva
the
base
beer
is
very
good
so
it
is
really
hard
to
go
wrong
i
think
the
barrel
aging
adds
subtle
complexity
and
nuances
to
the
flavor
of
pannepot
which
is
really
what
is
is
supposed
to
do
i
think
i
would
have
to
say
that
i
prefer
pannepot
reserva
at
this
point
next
up
is
pannepeut
overall
this
a
good
one
that
i
would
love
to
try
again
o
this
is
yet
another
excellent
take
on
pannepot
by
de
struise
brouwers
and
i
hope
to
see
more
experiments
like
this
from
them
in
the
future
though
this
is
not
my
favorite
version
of
pannepot
i
would
still
recommend
it
highly
to
fans
of
barrelaged
beers
andor
belgian
strong
ales
d
this
is
a
fantastic
beer
rich
complex
delicious
being
6
years
old
this
still
has
a
lot
of
unique
character
to
it
and
i
see
it
going
even
longer
without
too
many
problems
recommended
o
i
think
this
beer
is
fantastic
there
is
a
lot
of
complexity
to
this
brew
and
yet
it
feels
subdued
and
simple
the
flavors
are
spot
on
and
the
mouthfeel
is
just
right
color
me
extremely
impressed
this
is
the
best
quad
ive
ever
had
2005
vintage
pours
a
onefinger
light
brown
head
that
fades
quickly
leaving
some
lace
black
color
no
highlights
ton
of
yeast
left
in
bottle
medium
carbonation
and
medium
bodied
dark
fruit
and
alcohol
nose
and
flavor
is
also
alcohol
dark
fruit
and
some
oak
mellow
sweetness
very
similar
to
pannepot
reserva
expensive
at
11
49
for
a
330ml
label
claims
this
is
a
750ml
i
guess
they
ran
out
of
330ml
labels
bottle
from
julios
liquors
westborough
ma
o
a
very
smooth
complex
and
well
integrated
beer
this
wasnt
my
favorite
quad
and
i
think
the
original
might
be
better
but
i
would
sip
on
this
any
day
of
the
year
o
good
beer
nothing
thats
really
setting
it
head
and
shoulders
above
the
regular
versions
but
like
them
it
is
very
good
overall
this
is
a
very
sophisticated
quad
though
still
not
my
favourite
still
worth
trying
and
i
might
get
another
bottle
in
the
future
if
my
wallet
allows
d
this
has
much
much
more
life
left
in
it
for
future
aging
despite
being
6
years
old
or
so
a
solid
to
great
quad
that
i
think
will
only
just
get
better
and
better
with
time
based
upon
what
is
in
the
glass
in
front
of
me
though
it
is
quite
good
now
too
d
i
requested
another
and
was
dismayed
to
find
that
i
had
ordered
the
last
one
id
have
grabbed
another
in
a
heartbeat
and
now
im
on
the
trading
warpath
for
it
o
very
solid
beer
i
think
for
being
6
years
old
at
this
point
its
quite
superb
its
got
a
few
layers
of
things
going
on
but
isnt
too
complex
for
the
palate
o
this
is
probably
the
best
quad
ive
ever
had
and
certainly
the
most
complex
while
there
are
some
aspects
that
i
think
maybe
could
be
a
little
better
its
simply
amazing
as
it
is
id
highly
recommend
getting
a
bottle
if
you
ever
have
the
chance
o
overall
this
is
quite
simply
amazing
one
of
the
best
belgian
beers
ive
had
by
far
and
felt
it
was
way
better
than
than
the
normal
pannepot
o
trying
this
sidebyside
with
the
regular
was
a
very
interesting
experience
both
beers
are
excellent
but
id
give
the
slight
edge
to
the
regular
due
mainly
to
a
slight
edge
in
mouthfeel
i
also
feel
like
the
sweetness
of
the
grand
reserva
might
make
it
tough
to
drink
more
than
one
bottle
where
the
regular
pannepot
is
just
so
easy
to
drink
overall
however
im
just
nitpicking
both
are
great
beers
2005
vintage
had
to
finally
try
this
one
after
thoroughly
enjoying
the
standard
and
reserva
versions
it
pours
a
dark
cherrywood
topped
by
finger
of
dusty
khaki
foam
the
nose
comprises
fig
brown
sugar
toasted
caramel
light
oak
very
light
vanilla
dates
walnuts
dark
fruit
very
light
cocoa
and
a
small
touch
of
green
apple
the
taste
holds
notes
of
dark
fruits
pear
oak
brown
sugar
toffee
clove
light
vanilla
and
light
white
wine
grapes
the
fruitiness
is
a
bit
offputting
particularly
the
sourleaning
pear
and
spicy
grapes
the
body
is
a
straight
medium
with
a
very
light
moderate
carbonation
and
a
lightly
grainy
feel
overall
its
a
solid
beer
but
i
think
the
barrelaging
detracts
significantly
from
the
great
base
by
introducing
a
number
of
new
flavors
that
clash
with
the
preexisting
ones
still
pretty
good
though
interestingly
drinkability
is
really
high
but
for
my
money
ill
take
the
regular
version
every
time
the
oaking
adds
some
interesting
aspects
but
takes
away
a
lot
of
those
dark
fruit
notes
and
much
of
the
sweetness
that
i
love
in
the
regular
version
i
prefer
the
reserva
though
this
is
a
fine
beer
jd
onot
all
i
hoped
it
would
be
youd
never
know
this
was
6
years
old
it
seems
the
extensive
barrel
aging
has
stripped
away
pannepots
nuances
leaving
behind
a
perfectly
average
quadruppel
in
sum
this
is
a
denser
more
rounded
out
version
of
the
already
good
pannepot
worth
10
a
bottle
yes
at
least
once
it
pours
a
muddied
and
syrupy
dark
brown
full
bodied
with
the
look
of
creek
water
after
a
good
rain
it
looks
great
for
the
style
the
aromas
are
big
and
malty
its
very
bready
and
also
features
raisins
spiced
rum
toffee
molasses
cloves
and
sweet
banana
like
esters
the
flavors
are
heavy
on
raisin
bread
toffee
smooth
malts
molasses
and
it
finishes
with
a
light
yet
boozy
banana
finish
it
drinks
very
full
and
has
a
moderate
amount
of
alcohol
it
is
also
exceptionally
smooth
overall
this
is
a
fine
quad
with
good
complexity
and
well
worth
a
try
this
2005
bottle
came
courtesy
of
bermans
in
lexington
pannepot
grand
reserva
pours
out
a
dark
chestnut
color
with
just
a
small
amount
of
white
heading
the
first
thing
i
get
from
the
nose
is
brown
bread
followed
by
chocolate
candy
sugar
pepper
and
some
stone
fruit
the
flavor
is
very
jammy
with
elements
of
plum
dark
cherry
and
strawberry
the
alcohol
is
held
in
check
in
an
incredible
way
given
the
10
abv
mouthfeel
is
the
standout
here
in
that
it
is
incredibly
smooth
and
well
rounded
from
first
sip
to
last
i
have
had
many
versions
of
pannepot
over
the
years
and
i
have
to
say
that
none
have
impressed
me
in
the
way
that
this
one
does
it
is
so
damn
smooth
and
complex
it
rivals
any
of
the
trappist
quads
out
there
and
surpasses
some
of
them
despite
the
steep
price
tag
this
is
one
to
hunt
down
i
would
be
interested
to
see
what
further
aging
will
do
to
this
beer
but
it
is
drinking
wonderfully
right
now
o
i
like
it
better
than
pannepot
and
thats
saying
something
struise
does
it
again
i
will
be
going
back
for
more
bottles
asap
overall
what
a
tasty
treat
it
was
quite
the
ordeal
to
get
ahold
of
a
few
of
these
guys
but
i
am
extremely
happy
that
i
did
fans
of
pannepot
andor
quad
lovers
this
is
a
must
try
and
it
has
held
up
beautifully
o
its
hard
to
taste
the
aging
here
it
is
pretty
much
your
standard
belgian
quad
not
unlike
chimay
grand
reserve
o
a
very
good
quadrupel
not
as
good
as
a
westvleteren
12
but
definitely
worth
trying
overall
really
nice
stuff
a
pleasure
to
try
i
have
to
review
this
one
cause
i
drank
a
2005
bottle
yesterday
now
this
beer
is
about
8
years
old
and
it
just
becomes
better
and
better
wow
o
this
beer
was
amazing
certainly
the
best
quad
i
have
ever
had
i
drank
a
2008
reserva
last
night
and
found
the
earthy
raw
oak
notes
to
be
a
bit
distracting
this
perfected
that
fault
the
barrel
notes
are
so
smooth
and
delicate
and
do
not
over
power
whatsoever
my
favorite
pannepot
variation
for
sure
o
this
was
extremely
sweet
to
the
point
that
i
could
not
finish
it
it
was
enjoyable
for
about
a
third
of
the
glass
and
then
became
too
much
for
me
to
drink
a
very
very
nice
beer
the
oak
barrels
really
leave
their
mark
and
it
works
very
well
has
quite
a
different
taste
than
the
classic
quads
but
is
an
excellent
beer
however
i
do
find
that
it
is
a
bit
rich
hard
even
to
finish
a
regular
bottle
of
overall
incredible
glad
to
have
more
in
the
cellar
im
looking
forward
to
trying
later
vintages
because
this
2005
is
going
to
be
very
tough
to
beat
overall
fantastic
brew
quite
a
bit
different
from
the
2005
version
i
had
some
weeks
ago
though
that
one
had
much
more
red
fruits
in
the
taste
what
an
amazing
brew
leaving
you
to
want
more
this
is
a
brew
that
just
wont
quit
just
when
you
think
you
got
it
nailed
down
and
you
picked
up
on
everything
it
has
to
offer
it
shows
you
more
there
is
a
bunch
of
depth
to
this
brew
to
savor
and
enjoy
the
alcohol
is
initially
well
balanced
and
countered
by
the
residual
sugar
but
as
it
warms
up
it
gets
a
bit
boozy
and
the
10
abv
is
wide
out
in
the
open
and
not
hidden
at
all
this
is
medium
to
full
bodied
leaning
more
towards
full
than
medium
its
light
to
moderate
carbonation
is
perfect
to
give
some
bubbly
life
to
this
brew
but
not
distract
from
the
deep
rich
flavors
this
is
a
fantastic
sipper
among
the
best
i
have
had
not
only
from
struise
but
across
the
board
in
the
quad
category
poured
dark
reddishbrown
color
with
an
average
light
brown
frothy
head
that
mostly
lasted
with
good
lacing
medium
to
heavy
complex
dark
fruit
wood
caramel
and
alcohol
aroma
medium
to
full
body
with
a
smooth
texture
and
soft
carbonation
medium
to
heavy
complex
sweet
flavor
with
medium
to
heavy
fruity
sweet
finish
and
a
small
bite
of
alcohol
standout
brew
o
compared
to
my
first
pass
of
the
2005
this
one
was
a
home
run
it
is
evident
that
there
is
considerable
bottle
variation
among
these
brews
but
i
guess
that
comes
with
the
territory
the
2005
is
still
drinking
fabulously
seek
this
out
o
definitely
good
but
i
still
find
it
very
hard
to
top
regular
pannepot
or
the
reserva
b
overall
despite
the
questionable
and
worrisome
beginning
this
was
phenomenal
unlike
the
reserva
the
aging
on
the
grand
reserva
did
not
mute
the
spicy
wonders
that
make
the
base
pannepot
so
enjoyable
instead
the
aging
has
left
slight
nuances
of
oak
and
vanilla
throughout
that
really
do
compliment
the
brew
wonderful
nose
flavors
and
a
beautifully
creamy
palate
that
plays
the
supporting
role
perfectly
a
classic
example
of
an
oak
aged
brew
well
done
gentlemen
o
again
solid
beer
in
a
vaccuum
but
in
the
company
of
these
other
beers
the
grand
reserva
ended
up
6
of
10
id
still
go
out
of
my
way
to
drink
this
again
as
it
was
delicious
age
has
obviously
done
wonders
for
this
2005
bottle
alcohol
is
super
soft
and
the
beer
goes
down
really
creamy
very
nice
overall
tasty
was
kinda
disappointed
but
not
bad
o
excellent
as
expected
i
was
happy
to
find
this
as
im
on
a
work
trip
in
calgary
ive
seen
the
pannepot
name
floating
around
the
site
and
knew
it
had
to
be
good
i
concur
this
is
quite
tasty
theres
a
great
tart
green
apple
flavor
on
the
tongue
sweet
red
wine
brown
sugar
dates
very
fruity
oaky
earthy
not
necessarily
sweet
or
dry
the
midpalate
is
buttery
velvety
the
finish
shows
coffee
and
fig
tart
red
grapes
thoroughly
enjoyable
o
a
quality
yet
somewhat
unique
quad
the
barrel
aging
separates
this
beer
from
the
pack
somewhat
o
a
nice
quad
but
i
think
this
one
is
my
least
favorite
of
the
three
pannepot
beers
little
too
much
raisinsfigs
in
the
taste
and
i
think
the
extra
time
in
the
barrels
muted
some
of
the
other
smells
and
flavors
would
like
to
have
again
as
i
heard
a
new
batch
is
coming
out
but
considering
this
is
the
toughest
one
for
me
to
get
id
rather
just
buy
the
normal
pannepot
off
the
shelves
i
have
tried
pannepot
old
fishermans
ale
and
now
pannepot
grand
reserva
and
i
cannot
say
that
i
was
enamored
by
either
of
them
between
the
somewhat
muted
flavor
profile
and
the
excessive
carbonation
this
beer
simply
did
not
do
much
for
me
this
just
feels
like
a
simmering
time
bomb
the
alcohol
in
there
somewhere
strategizing
scheming
beneath
the
enjoyable
barrelinformed
fruity
malt
incredibly
tasty
subdued
and
maybe
a
little
dangerous
sublimely
easy
to
drink
at
least
for
this
one
bottle
as
that
20proof
abv
would
make
itself
known
eventually
may
have
caught
this
bottle
a
bit
past
its
prime
but
its
still
a
complex
and
pleasurable
beer
glad
to
have
had
the
opportunity
to
savor
this
rarity
about
half
way
through
my
quadrupel

really
nice
creamy
lacing
initial
blast
of
single
malt
scotch
whiskey
toffee
comes
in
quite
a
bit
as
it
warms
creamy
and
rich
a
booziness
can
easily
be
detected
from
the
getgo
the
biggest
weakness
here
is
a
strange
astringent
bitterness
around
the
edges
which
comes
off
as
almost
sour
and
simply
doesnt
belong
in
this
brew
its
really
rich
creamy
has
a
lot
of
nice
components
but
certainly
didnt
all
seem
to
come
together
right
not
as
good
as
the
normal
pannepot
outstanding
beer
and
getting
more
complex
as
it
warms
i
cant
get
enough
of
the
struise
pannepot
offerings
cant
have
enough
of
this
in
the
cellar
d
this
is
a
good
beer
rich
and
complex
rather
easy
drinking
with
a
nice
balance
of
flavors
taste
is
a
bit
oakywoody
theres
raisins
sweet
caramel
malt
and
some
sharp
carbonation
theres
lots
of
rich
malts
a
bit
of
dark
chocolate
its
quite
creamy
and
smooth
with
a
fairly
good
mouthfeel
you
get
a
tingling
on
your
tongue
afterwards
from
the
alcohol
and
the
sweet
malts
it
is
strong
and
complex
but
fairly
easy
drinking
overall
a
good
beer
but
if
i
were
to
introduce
someone
to
this
style
i
would
probably
go
with
something
else
a
try
it
beer
cheers
so
my
biggest
criticism
of
this
beer
is
that
i
cant
taste
the
oak
it
says
on
the
bottle
that
its
oak
aged
but
there
is
no
real
vanilla
or
tannic
character
it
is
however
good
tasting
its
sweet
malty
no
alcohol
really
mildly
spicy
in
the
midpalate
some
plums
and
mild
raisins
very
good
this
beer
appears
a
dark
brown
color
there
is
an
off
white
tan
head
that
fades
to
about
14
inch
and
holds
spotty
lacing
encompasses
the
circumference
of
the
tulip
glass
the
aroma
is
of
an
authentic
belgian
quad
yeasty
bready
enticing
the
taste
is
incredibly
smooth
and
delicious
five
years
of
age
on
a
well
crafted
quad
does
some
wonderful
things
there
is
a
slight
hint
of
alcohol
in
the
finish
but
it
only
serves
to
add
a
warming
sensation
to
the
finish
enhancing
not
distracting
from
the
overall
taste
profile
what
a
great
beer
im
glad
to
have
sampled
it
it
is
incredibly
drinkable
this
beer
could
do
a
lot
of
damage
it
tastes
and
feels
nothing
like
i
expect
a
10
abv
beer
to
be
im
a
little
glad
it
is
so
rare
as
otherwise
i
would
drink
it
all
the
time
i
do
wish
i
had
a
second
pour
before
i
left
lovell
this
is
an
exceptional
beer
easily
one
of
the
best
d
not
a
beer
that
you
have
more
than
one
of
in
a
session
heavy
filling
beer
notes
vintage
2005
pretty
good
beer
but
im
not
entirely
sure
if
the
aging
in
the
calvados
really
made
an
improvement
to
either
the
normal
pannepot
or
the
reserva
as
it
detracts
a
bit
from
the
enjoyable
flavors
in
those
two
it
does
add
a
little
something
different
though
this
is
another
great
beer
from
a
great
brewery
and
worth
trying
but
i
dont
really
feel
like
i
need
to
have
it
again
if
i
can
get
other
pannepot
offerings
this
is
another
excellent
beer
from
struise
a
big
complex
quad
with
an
intriguing
barrel
presence
lots
of
oaky
tannins
notes
my
second
favorite
of
the
three
expressions
tasted
the
acidity
balances
things
out
in
a
more
proper
way
than
the
alcohol
of
the
pannepot
but
conversely
theres
less
residual
sugar
which
makes
me
prefer
the
pannepot
its
a
conundrum
indeed
excellently
crafted
though
really
a
shining
example
drinkability
shouldnt
be
high
but
it
is
immense
it
just
goes
down
so
smoothly
and
tastes
so
full
and
delicious
so
glad
i
got
to
try
this
one
d
drinks
nicely
but
the
rotten
fruitsourness
is
very
distracting
a
real
masterpiece
this
is
not
only
beer
this
is
pure
art
this
is
pretty
good
but
i
was
hoping
for
a
little
more
the
tart
flavor
held
me
back
a
bit
to
be
honest
this
is
what
happens
sometimes
when
drinking
an
aged
beer
i
would
say
without
hesitation
the
struise
pannepot
is
one
of
the
most
finely
crafted
beers
i
know
of
and
that
it
serves
not
only
as
perhaps
the
finest
example
of
its
style
but
also
as
physical
testament
to
the
artistry
that
defines
the
belgian
brewing
tradition
at
large
this
version
of
it
is
a
beer
that
to
quote
harold
mcgee
touches
the
mind
not
with
release
from
the
world
but
with
a
heightened
attentiveness
and
connection
to
it
pour
is
a
mahogany
with
a
brilliant
head
when
the
bartender
popped
it
came
in
a
rush
pour
was
about
3
fingers
of
head
a
very
intense
nose
belgian
yeast
beligian
cane
figs
molasses
and
toasted
almonds
and
port
wine
palate
was
all
that
with
a
intense
amount
of
volume
a
mild
sour
quality
that
ive
only
tasted
in
the
de
rocs
grand
cru
i
really
like
de
roc
and
this
beer
seems
like
a
higher
gravity
of
that
beer
also
seemed
a
bit
too
sweet
to
the
point
that
i
hid
the
other
flavors
and
even
the
alcohol
like
a
brick
expect
theyre
different
styles
quite
dense
and
complex
as
the
beer
expands
on
the
palate
wonderful
feel
it
goes
down
a
smooth
sipper
excellent
end
of
the
night
beer
oh
yeah
2005
from
the
big
bottle
rich
brown
with
swirly
head
moderate
aroma
of
malts
and
slight
alcohol
sweet
malt
flavors
with
some
bitterness
spices
funkiness
a
little
more
complex
than
the
regular
pannepot
tasty
rich
very
nice
overall
a
very
easy
drinking
brew
for
a
quad
i
truly
believe
that
the
five
year
vintage
has
really
changed
the
characteristic
of
the
beer
the
best
beer
store
in
town
has
a
lot
of
these
sitting
on
a
shelf
but
at
11
00
dollars
for
a
330ml
bottle
its
a
bit
pricey
d
big
flavors
make
this
one
a
sipper
but
these
big
malty
belgian
beers
are
among
my
favorites
great
overall
beer
o
a
good
example
of
a
strong
belgian
ale
the
apple
aroma
is
a
good
touch
i
couldnt
really
pull
out
the
oak
aroma
out
of
this
beer
perhaps
lost
over
the
maturation
of
this
beer
i
would
not
age
this
beer
for
more
than
2
years
due
to
loss
of
key
belgian
flavors
in
this
sample
drinkability
is
sadly
awesome
the
best
quad
ive
ever
had
of
course
its
a
super
rare
brew
thats
5
years
old
hopefully
theyll
make
more
again
the
label
from
the
ontario
importer
roland
russell
claims
its
limited
to
30
hl
2
years
thats
not
a
lot
but
it
implies
they
at
least
intended
to
rerelease
it
but
the
fact
is
its
hard
to
get
i
saw
it
going
for
over
100
a
bottle
at
some
beer
bar
in
the
bay
area
after
i
traded
for
it
although
i
doubt
they
really
sell
it
at
that
price
which
hurts
the
score
a
bit
even
if
im
in
love
at
the
first
whiff
what
a
great
beer
the
very
definition
of
artisinal
beer
thank
you
de
struise
overall
this
was
a
great
beer
but
i
preferred
the
regular
version
better
d
very
drinkable
delicious
love
pretty
much
everything
that
struise
does
full
creamy
body
has
a
nice
vinous
finish
another
truly
artisinal
ale
from
urbain
overall
i
didnt
have
great
expectations
because
although
i
like
pannepot
i
dont
think
its
on
par
with
trappists
however
after
drinking
this
it
clearly
is
deserved
in
such
praise
great
beer
time
is
treating
this
one
well
glad
i
have
another
750ml
in
the
cellar
still
out
of
a
vintage
2006
bottle
this
beer
was
a
dark
burgundy
color
with
two
fingers
of
beige
head
that
retained
well
and
left
rings
of
lacing
down
my
glass
the
aroma
was
of
dark
fruits
roasted
malt
toasted
malt
sour
apples
from
the
french
oak
barrels
and
spices
the
flavors
were
complex
and
highly
advanced
i
hate
to
sound
pretentious
but
this
would
roll
right
over
a
pedestrian
beer
drinker
i
tasted
the
french
oak
an
array
of
malts
plums
raisins
simple
syrup
brown
sugar
port
wine
buttery
bread
and
alcohol
on
the
finish
there
was
so
much
going
on
and
the
elements
were
so
well
blended
it
was
difficult
to
discern
the
spices
but
this
impressive
montage
of
flavors
was
reflective
of
how
well
executed
the
beer
was
my
only
complaint
was
the
french
oak
plus
calvados
that
the
beer
was
aged
in
came
through
so
strongly
especially
as
it
warmed
up
that
it
suppressed
some
of
the
more
subtle
elements
the
mouthfeel
was
creamy
the
body
mediumfull
and
the
carbonation
medium
d
masterfully
hidden
abv
in
the
taste
however
dispite
its
pluses
this
is
never
going
to
be
a
session
brew
its
a
complex
sipper
that
needs
to
be
pondered
im
not
sure
if
its
better
than
the
other
pannepot
variants
but
its
definitely
excellent
and
worth
trying
another
great
beer

one
of
my
new
favorite
breweries

yeasty
funk
at
the
beginning
oakvanilla
elements
dominate
the
palette
with
mild
sweetness
and
bitterness
and
a
very
slight

no
detectable
belgian

phenols
though
there
may
be
a

eric
i
would
have
to
do
a
sidebyside
to
really
be
able
to
make
a
judgement
call
but
based
on
memory
i
have
found
the
pannepot
pannepot
reserva
and
pannepot
grand
reserva
to
all
be
relatively
equal
and
world
class
brews
they
all
have
their
own
strengths
and
their
own
weaknesses
but
all
are
amazing
d
this
beer
is
intense
but
its
so
damn
good
it
keeps
you
wanting
more
overall
this
beer
was
absolutely
legen
wait
for
it
dary
overall
what
a
night
for
me
this
and
delphine
back
to
back
i
was
blown
away
by
both
the
pannepot
is
good
for
me
but
this
is
great
it
really
just
came
together
damn
near
perfect
for
me
i
would
love
to
have
this
again
any
day
maybe
age
it
for
a
year
or
two
more
d
for
the
style
very
i
didnt
much
care
for
the
regular
pannepot
but
this
is
a
completely
different
beast
tart
grape
plum
reminds
me
of
the
essence
of
grape
soda
without
the
cloying
sugary
sweet
character
the
oak
is
well
integrated
into
the
overall
flavour
of
the
beer
and
just
adds
to
the
complexity
instead
of
screaming
oak
im
glad
i
got
the
chance
to
try
this
as
it
really
is
outstanding
but
the
price
point
about
14
per
330ml
bottle
in
alberta
seems
a
tad
excessive
aging
an
outstanding
quadrupel
in
calvados
barrels
sounds
like
a
good
idea
but
it
didnt
contribute
anything
worthwhile
in
the
end
i
dont
care
whether
or
not
grand
reserva
is
brewed
again
as
long
as
de
struise
brouwers
continues
to
provide
us
with
the
standard
pannepot
fishermans
ale
thanks
to
biegaman
for
the
bottle
the
oak
aging
seems
to
give
some
interesting
complexities
but
loses
some
of
the
robustness
of
flavor
the
original
pannepot
has
if
you
cant
choose
between
beer
and
wine
grab
this
one
its
best
of
both
worlds
a
great
brew
like
the
picture
on
this
site
above
mine
was
a
2005
vintage
so
it
would
have
been
four
years
old
i
suppose
when
i
drank
it
the
time
blended
and
mellowed
the
flavors
to
make
me
extremely
sad
that
i
didnt
buy
two
or
more
of
these
back
in
2007
i
think
it
was
d
a
great
beer
packed
with
strong
and
bold
flavors
maybe
it
could
have
been
a
little
more
balanced
nonetheless
highly
recommended
d
as
a
professed
lover
of
the
pannepot
brews
this
one
was
a
must
for
me
had
many
of
the
elements
of
the
quadrupels
of
theirs
ive
enjoyed
though
the
muddled
medley
of
flavors
here
didny
make
me
a
convert
to
this
over
the
regular
pannepot
still
id
never
turn
one
down
again
big
thanks
to
paul
for
sharing
this
treat
drinkability
i
personally
liked
the
regular
version
of
pannepot
better
but
this
is
still
pretty
good
if
not
for
the
metallic
note
it
would
be
right
up
there
with
some
of
the
better
ones
a
rather
anticlimactic
quad
when
all
is
said
and
done
hopefully
it
ages
well
and
things
come
together
a
bit
more
over
the
years
it
is
a
very
good
beer
but
still
inferior
to
regular
pannepot
better
than
reserva
amber
red
color
with
a
tan
head
that
quickly
dissipates
to
a
ring
around
the
glass
smell
is
of
green
apple
spices
and
some
wood
taste
consists
of
caramel
toffee
spices
clove
but
this
is
also
very
metallic
even
moreso
than
the
regular
reserva
light
bodied
with
a
rather
high
carbonation
id
try
this
again
but
i
dont
know
that
id
seek
it
out
it
seems
like
id
just
stick
with
regular
pannepot
over
any
of
the
reservas
thanks
to
pepsican
for
the
sample
mouthfeel
is
medium
bodied
with
raisins
and
brown
sugar
clinging
to
the
palate
making
for
a
sweet
but
delicious
beer
for
the
money
id
stick
with
the
regular
pannepot
but
this
is
another
fantastic
brew
and
well
worth
trying
dark
brown
with
some
reddish
highlights
a
moderate
pour
produced
a
fluffy
beige
cap
excellent
head
retention
with
two
fingers
of
foam
settling
to
a
fingers
worth
over
several
minutes
leaving
behind
some
chunky
clinging
lace
a
thin
cap
lingered
right
through
to
the
bottom
of
the
glass
big
dried
fruit
aroma
mostly
raisins
with
some
earthy
prune
skin
and
figs
lots
of
malt
too
rich
and
sweet
with
notes
of
molasses
and
toffee
dominating
along
with
cake
and
dough
in
the
background
kind
of
smells
like
fruitcake
but
much
better
than
that
with
a
hint
of
boozy
rum
wood
character
was
quite
subdued
but
there
was
a
bit
of
vanilla
in
there
very
fruity
flavour
too
again
with
the
dried
fruits
mentioned
above
but
with
more
of
a
fresh
plum
character
alcohol
was
more
pronouned
than
in
the
aroma
as
were
mellow
oak
tannins
alcohol
was
a
little
spicy
in
the
finish
and
vanilla
appeared
here
as
well
lots
of
sweetness
but
just
a
little
of
that
was
from
brown
sugar
and
toffee
flavours
more
from
the
fruit
department
finished
with
a
bit
of
cherry
sourness
pretty
tasty
medium
to
full
bodied
with
creamy
lowish
carbonation
just
a
bit
of
astringent
dryness
and
plenty
of
warmth
really
quite
good
and
pretty
drinkable
for
a
big
beer
dark
brown
with
a
small
ruby
head
and
tight
carbonation
aromas
of
various
spices
and
heavy
duty
german
style
maltings
star
anise
fennel
and
licorice
come
to
my
mind
and
upon
first
sip
they
also
hit
my
palate
kinda
chocolatey
yet
not
really
there
is
some
cinnamon
flavors
in
here
as
well
mouthfeel
is
creamy
but
not
too
thick
or
over
the
top
drinkability
is
good
but
i
could
not
drink
this
one
all
night
as
the
spices
would
definately
get
to
me
after
awhile
this
is
more
rounded
less
spicy
and
more
drinkable
than
the
regular
version
mad
props
to
northyorksammy
for
the
hookup
pours
a
very
nice
brown
color
nice
carbonation
nice
little
tan
head
with
some
nice
sticky
lacing
left
behing
the
nose
is
malty
with
some
plums
raisins
figs
the
taste
is
malty
some
dark

oaky
medium

very
drinkable
this
is
a
very
tasty
brew
highly
recommended
thanks
eric
bottom
line
this
is
damn
good
stuff
there
is
so
much
going
on
with
pannepot
grand
reserva
but
it
blends
very
well
this
seems
to
be
just
getting
in
to
its
own
right
now
and
this
the
2005
vintage
probably
still
has
quite
a
long
way
before
it
starts
deteriorating
the
best
by
date
of
2012
is
definitely
not
a
joke
i
am
really
enjoying
this
beer
the
oak
character
is
very
soft
which
is
nice
with
the
biggest
influence
being
the
rum
brandy
notes
picked
up
from
the
calvados
cask
this
is
a
very
good
beer
one
which
i
easily
wish
i
had
more
than
330ml
of
my
bottle
is
gone
way
to
fast
leaving
me
really
wishing
that
i
had
more
if
i
could
make
this
better
i
would
add
a
touch
more
tartness
the
lactic
note
that
is
here
is
quite
soft
and
there
is
lots
of
fruit
and
malt
character
that
could
easily
balance
out
a
touch
more
sourness
this
is
my
favourite
beer
from
belgium
until
this
date
beating
the
rochefort
10
wonderful
id
really
like
to
lay
my
hands
on
a
few
more
of
these

in
this
and

i
cant

im
too
impressed
ill

with

easily
distinguishable
with
some
oak

and
light

taste
is
also
dominated
by
the
calvados
notes
with
some

notes
and
a
nice
lightly
sweet
malt
base
great
carbonation
with
a
full
body
and
no
discernable
alcohol
notes
very
well
done
overall
but
i
still
think
i
prefer
the
original
pannepot
and
maybe
the
oakagedcalvadosaged
has
replace
some
of
the
complexity
of
the
original
beer
sampled
at
ma
che
siete
venuti
a
fà
in
roma
and
then
again
at
monks
cafe
in
stockholm
i
was
underwhelmed
both
times
mostly
i
failed
to
see
how
the
wood
had
that
big
of
an
influence
on
the
beer
lately
i
have
been
drinking
a
lot
of
regular
pannepot
2006
nearly
2
years
old
its
amazing
that
beer
has
more
complexity
to
me
than
the
grand
reserva
so
yes
this
was
a
tasty
beer
but
i
expected
more
oak
character
pours
a
dark
murky
brown
in
color
some
chunkiness
a
good
sized
medium
tan
head
slowly
fades
with
a
little
lacing
aroma
is
bready
with
a
little
spice
some
sweet
raisins
and
some
slightly
tart
smelling
cherry
taste
follows
this
well
with
the
breadiness
mixing
with
the
raisin
and
dark
fruit
sweetness
up
front
a
small
amount
of
the
slightly
tart
cherry
and
apple
comes
in
mid
taste
and
blends
well
with
some
spices
and
a
good
woody
flavor
mouthfeel
is
medium
in
body
decent
spiciness
mid
taste
to
the
finish
cuts
through
the
maltiness
and
leads
into
a
good
dryness
a
small
amount
of
alcohol
warmth
at
the
back
of
the
throat
in
the
finish
very
nice
beer
the
wood
ageing
has
worked
well
with
the
flavors
and
especially
the
feel
beer
poured
a
block
hole
like
color
dense
with
a
tan
head
bubbley
the
aroma
is
pleasing
to
the
nose
oaky
toasted
malt
yet
a
bit
sweet
dried
fruits
in
the
aroma
a
bit
the
taste
is
complex
to
say
the
least
up
front
there
are
potent
spicy
notes
banana
corriander
maybe
some
dried
fruits
and
definite
oak
tones
the
high
abv
is
a
bit
hidden
by
the
complex
flavors
but
you
can
still
feel
it
on
the
back
end
a
very
full
bodied
beer
and
definitely
worth
the
wait
to
try
it
drinkability
quite
nice
a
superb

i
take

well
and
tastes
like
it
is
bottle
conditioned
a
very
good
beer
a
top
10
beer
overall
a
very
good
beer
but
not
quite
as
wonderful
as
the
standard
pannepot
this
is
the
best
quad
ive
had
maybe
a
tad
too
sweet
or
simplistic
for
some
people
but
it
hit
the
spot
for
me
maybe
having
cuvee
delphine
and
other
de
struise
heavies
before
this
one
counts
too
but
still
im
a
bit
disappointed
a
good
quad
but
not
amongst
the
best
aging
might
help
dark
hazy
pour
with
almost
no
foam
huge
strawberry
smell
with
faint
traces
of

finish
if
you
havent
tried
this
now
you
have
a
goal
in
life
first
attempt
at
a
review
here
gos
nothin
brought
from
the
brewery
itself
great
place
to
visit
on
a
saturday
first
impressions
this
is
very
similar
to
westvleteren
vii
maybe
they
could
be
using
the
same
water
just
as
with
the
westy
the
alcohol
is
very
smooth
for
a
quad
molasses
and
dates
dominate
the
taste
profile
overall
one
of
my
top
beers
thanks
bobertkuekn
for
the
opportunity
pours
a
deep
dark
brown
with
some
reddish
highlights
starts
out
with
a
finger
or
so
of
tan
bubbles
that
recede
to
a
ring
around
the
edge
in
a
couple
of
minutes
the
aroma
is
of
flavorful
dark
bread
backed
by
rich
dark
fruits
with
a
touch
of
caramel
and
toffee
as
well
the
taste
has
a
lot
of
the
same
notes
as
the
smell
upfront
i
am
noticing
that
this
beer
is
pretty
sweet
so
the
toffee
and
caramel
are
very
noticeable
the
bread
and
biscuit
come
next
and
they
are
quickly
followed
by
a
bit
of
pepper
that
i
guess
is
from
the
hops
and
alcohol
that
does
tend
to
creep
up
as
the
beer
warms
greatly
filling
but
not
too
heavy
low
carbonation
and
a
smooth
mouthfeel
that
finishes
relatively
clean
if
not
just
a
tiny
bit
dry
with
a
touch
of
sweetness
that
suggests
the
fruit
very
pleased
to
have
had
the
opportunity
to
try
this
one
i
think
ive
had
better
quads
but
this
one
is
authentic
and
very
nice
overall
a
very
tasty
brew
from
struise
its
perhaps
not
at
the
very
top
of
their
game
but
the
very
top
of
stuises
game
is
worldconquering
poured
a
rich
amber
nice
laces
from
a
frothy
head
smells
dank
and
metal
tastes
excellent
very
full
body
from
strong
malts
and
grain
the
barrel
certainly
comes
through
very
smooth
this
is
an
excellent
quad
very
light
for
the
abv
this
is
actually
a
lot
like
westvleteren
but
sweeter
and
a
bit
vinous
note
it
is
also
a
lot
better
carbonated
westvleteren
right
next
to
it
was
a
pretty
young
bottle
4
months
and
was
overcarbonated
than
westvleteren
and
has
a
sprucy
refreshing
taste
which
gives
it
a
great
drinkability
more
hops
a
bit
oak
a
bit
less
dark
fruit
but
for
me
still
more
interesting
od
nice
stuff
you
can
pull
out
the
bourbon
aging
and
its
a
good
quad
altogether
complex
and
great
for
sipping
while
this
to
me
remind
me
a
lot
of
cuvee
delphine
for
a
quad
it
is
very
nice
however
for
an
imperial
stout
it
is
not
really
appropriate
as
such
ive
rated
this
highly
whereas
the
similar
cuvee
delphine
despite
being
an
ostensibly
completely
different
beer
would
get
a
far
lower
rating
im
guessing
the
barrels
are
very
dominant
in
these
two
mentioned
beers
an
interesting
and
lightly
spiced

feeling
the
greatness
and
was
expecting
way
more
out
of
this
for
barrel
aging
quite
fruity
overall
with
a
nice
trappist
yeast
spice
good
malt
complexity
in
there
as
well
o
a
very
straightforward
quad
thats
good
but
has
me
wanting
more
flavor
nothing
overly
exciting
about
this
one
hides
the
alcohol
well
though
very
interesting
juxtaposition
of
flavors
for
a
quad
not
cloying
and
the
toasted
malt
character
is
intriguing
a
little
hot
id
love
to
seer
some
age
on
this
to
let
the
esters
come
out
o
a
great
quad
overall
one
of
the
best
examples
of
the
style
with
a
lot
of
depth
and
nuance
while
being
incredibly
drinkable
poured
into
a
snifter
this
brew
looks
like
a
quad
ruddy
chocolate
brown
with
a
weak
tan
head
lots
of
yeast
in
the
bottle
colder
the
aromas
of
candied
raisins
and
ripe
grapes
come
on
strong
with
some
hints
of
roasted
malt
too
yeasty
with
hints
of
alcohol
when
drinking
ill
start
with
what
i
think
knocks
this
one
a
notch
below
st
benardus
and
westys
quad
it
lacks
the
complex
esters
and
phenols
present
which
help
mask
the
hefty
alcohol
content
now
i
still
think
this
is
a
solid
quad
and
if
an
american
brewer
made
one
this
good
id
be
all
over
it
the
malt
bill
is
solid
and
the
body
is
nice
and
heavy
yet
finishes
dry
and
quickly
although
its
a
bit
hot
the
dark
fruits
are
prominent
and
delicious
maybe
even
too
much
as
some
anise
comes
through
which
id
rather
not
have
in
a
quad
o
honestly
i
was
very
disappointed
with
this
aged
fruit
was
minor
at
best
medium
body
one
of
the
thinnest
belgians
ive
ever
tasted
aged
in
woodford
reserve
barrels
if
this
is
true
there
is
no
recollection
of
this
none
and
i
was
really
looking
forward
to
this
high
point
was
the
booze
was
hidden
pretty
well
lastly
at
10
for
a
10
oz
pour
i
do
not
recommend
this
to
anyone
i
felt
robbed
overall
i
cant
for
the
life
of
me
remember
what
i
didnt
like
about
st
amatus
the
last
time
i
had
it
as
this
bottle
is
fantastic
and
actually
one
of
the
best
quads
that
i
have
had
i
will
certainly
be
buying
more
bottles
in
the
future
o
a
very
nice
quad
complex
sweetness
spiciness
from
the
yeast
big
thanks
goes
out
to
furthurgone
for
this
one
as
a
part
of
the
birthday
bif
2010
vintage
enjoyed
this
one
during
rivalry
saturday
while
watching
my
yellow
jackets
play
the
dawgs
due
to
the
slaughter
taking
place
i
upped
the
abv
for
this
one
served
from
bottle
into
an
orval
goblet
poured
brown
with
a
one
finger
very
light
tan
head
that
subsided
to
a
minimal
amount
slowly
maintained
excellent
lacing
throughout
the
glass
the
aroma
was
comprised
of
sweet
malt
toasted
malt
bread
dark
fruit
sweet
alcohol
fruit
and
very
subtle
sugar
the
flavor
was
of
sweet
malt
bread
dark
fruit
fruit
sweet
alcohol
caramel
sugar
and
subtle
earth
it
had
a
medium
feel
on
the
palate
with
mediumhigh
carbonation
overall
this
was
a
good
brew
all
of
the
components
of
a
really
solid
quad
were
present
in
this
one
which
was
quite
nice
a
nice
balance
of
sweetness
and
booziness
made
this
one
surprisingly
easy
to
drink
despite
the
higher
abv
the
aroma
was
very
inviting
and
rather
pleasant
as
well
definitely
a
must
try
for
any
quad
fan
out
there
who
has
not
done
so
already
drinkability
is
okay
its
an
interesting
beer
but
for
the
masterful
portfolio
that
de
struiss
has
this
one
is
a
little
disappointing
pours
a
dark
copper
with
a
rocky
tan
head
that
settles
into
a
thin
layer
with
no
lacing
smells
of
oranges
leather
and
a
nice
biscuit
aroma
taste
is
caramel
and
a
nice
malt
the
finish
is
slightly
dry
and
with
a
very
subtle
hops
this
is
a
very
delicate
taste
dark
but
gentle
like
i
like
my
women
the
mouthfeel
is
slick
and
just
a
tad
chewy
it
makes
you
pay
attention
whether
you
want
to
or
not
like
i
like
my
women
this
is
a
fantastic
beer
it
has
a
lot
going
on
and
is
delicious
without
being
so
challenging
that
you
cant
introduce
it
to
newbies
this
is
a
keeper
for
sure
not
what
i
would
expect
from
a
quadrupel
a
bit
darker
but
a
nice
deviation
from
the
style
and
we
all
like
to
be
devious
every
once
in
a
while
dont
we
mahogany
with
a
mocha
head
good
retention
and
lacing
nose
has
a
helluva
lot
of
metal
ferrous
from
top
to
bottom
some
dark
fruits
molasses
chocolate
and
a
bit
of
rum
are
peripheral
taste
has
the
metal
again
up
front
dark
fruits
slight
chocolate
even
a
hint
of
roast
way
into
the
finish
medium
heavy
mouthfeel
metal
notes
persist
behind
a
medium
high
carbonation
way
too
much
metal
going
on
here
perhaps
an
issue
with
the
batchshippingtransport
i
was
completely
let
down
by
this
beer
and
this
was
probably
exacerbated
by
the
huge
expectations
i
had
drainpoured
unfortunately
o
this
could
stand
up
next
to
some
of
the
other
big
quads
might
not
be
quite
there
but
isnt
far
behind
by
any
means
o
its
a
shame
this
beer
is
in
the
shadows
of
the
greatness
that
is
pannepot
and
its
variants
this
beer
is
really
unique
and
delicious
and
the
chocolate
notes
are
just
phenomenal
i
wish
this
was
beer
was
more
accessible
overall
its
good
but
way
too
fruity
i
miss
the
earthy
complexity
of
pannepot
in
this
one
o
excellent
drinkability
great
beer
de
struise
quality
highly
recommended
from
a
big
fan
of
belgian
quads
i
like
the
beer
but
it
is
not
my
number
one
quadrupel
i
guess
i
miss
the
sweetness
to
balance
the
bitterness
or
is
it
not
complex
enough
and
i
would
appreciate
to
taste
more
what
the
nose
promises
however
it
is
an
interesting
take
on
the
genre
and
worth
a
try
a
delightful
quad
lots
of
amazing
malt
character
and
a
fantastic
cherry
fruit
note
sublime
i
will
most
definately
revisit
this
one
i
really
enjoyed
this
beer
not
to
sweet
not
to
tart
pretty
much
a
perfect
quad
without
a
doubt
one
of
the
best
quads
overall
it
has
a
struise
signature
that
tendsto
make
big
bers
just
awesome
any
lover
of
the
style
will
ahve
to
add
did
to
their
wants
or
youll
be
missing
out
o
overall
this
is
a
quad
you
like
quads
try
this
one
and
as
many
pannepots
as
you
can
get
ahold
of
truly
impressive
for
the
style
de
struise
continues
to
impress
o
a
very
solid
beer
from
a
very
solid
brewery
d
some
really
interesting
elements
here
that
dont
quite
hit
the
heights
of
their
other
quads
even
though
this
is
the
case
theyve
set
the
bar
so
high
that
this
is
still
a
very
good
beer
o
delicious
if
there
are
spices
in
here
which
according
to
the
2010
label
i
found
online
there
are
they
are
much
more
subdued
than
the
other
spiced
struise
beers
e
g
pannepot
tsjeeses
the
final
product
is
a
pleasingly
complex
yet
harmonious
quad
that
to
its
benefit
retains
a
certain
amount
of
simplicity
put
otherwise
it
tastes
like
a
very
natural
quad
if
that
makes
any
sense
and
is
well
worth
seeking
out
o
an
extremely
aggressive
quad
the
flavors
all
work
but
the
sweetness
is
verging
on
overpowering
definitely
a
sipper
its
a
good
beer
but
i
definitely
prefer
pannepot
st
amatus
12
goes
in
the
glass
pretty
dark
with
a
mix
of
dark
browns
and
reds
look
is
a
bit
murky
but
this
is
a
quad
here
ive
seen
dirtier
nothing
in
terms
of
head
cap
lace
nothing
smell
is
about
the
dark
fruits
and
less
about
the
spices
nice
aroma
of
plum
and
the
like
and
maybe
a
bit
of
licorice
no
alcohol
in
the
nose
bready
as
well
with
yeast
apparent
this
is
a
nice
change
of
pace
from
the
pannepot
more
fruity
and
bready
and
not
as
much
spices
used
imo
some
clove
makes
an
apperance
with
warming
the
flavors
work
well
together
the
feel
off
the
tap
almost
killed
it
though
this
was
basically
dead
and
it
needs
a
boost
badly
glad
to
have
tried
this
though
a
good
beer
that
stands
on
its
own
too
feet
i
wonder
if
this
is
the
same
base
beer
as
pannepot
with
less
spice
o
i
for
some
reason
had
the
highest
expectations
of
this
quad
from
de
struise
than
all
the
others
it
was
actually
probably
my
least
favorite
a
really
good
beer
dont
get
me
wrong
holds
its
own
with
some
of
the
best
in
the
style
but
when
compared
to
pannepot
and
pannepeut
it
was
not
as
good
based
on
my
liking
medium
bodied
with
a
strong
dpice
presence
up
front
with
pepper
and
clove
followed
by
some
aniselicorice
sweet
malt
and
dark
fruit
lots
of
vinous
grape
along
with
fig
raisin
caramel
and
toffee
mediocre
a
bit
thin
and
too
heavy
on
the
spice
i
love
struise
and
was
really
excited
to
try
this
but
it
was
a
huge
disappointment
hopefully
the
bottles
are
better
first
beer
at
capones
black
friday
event
this
poured
out
as
a
nice
reddish
brown
color
with
a
thin
white
head
on
top
the
smell
of
the
beer
has
a
sweetness
to
it
with
some
dark
fruit
aromas
and
some
hints
of
vanilla
the
taste
of
the
beer
wasnt
as
balanced
as
la
trappe
or
westy
but
still
not
too
bad
there
were
hints
of
fruits
and
caramel
its
not
overly
sweet
and
had
a
light
bitterness
in
the
back
end
the
mouthfeel
was
pretty
good
there
was
a
softness
to
the
beer
with
a
light
creamy
feel
as
well
smooth
and
medium
bodied
overall
this
beer
was
pretty
good
overall
sweet
and
very
complex
all
the
flavors
blend
quite
well
and
i
would
definitely
have
another
definitely
worthy
of
a
try
if
you
come
across
it
this
beer
was
the
deciding
factor
in
me
choosing
to
go
to
nellies
this
night
hopefully
it
holds
up
it
pours
a
dark
siennagarnet
topped
by
a
halffinger
of
dirty
tan
foam
i
blame
the
pour
for
the
small
head
though
frankly
the
nos
comprises
fig
light
raisin
light
roasted
malts
very
light
cocoa
brown
sugar
and
caramel
the
taste
brings
in
more
of
the
same
along
with
some
dark
red
grapes
very
close
to
the
flavor
of
some
rich
red
wines
light
tobacco
light
walnut
and
light
mandarin
orange
syrup
the
caramel
comes
in
a
bit
more
toasted
and
the
roast
is
slightly
more
pronounced
the
body
is
a
heftyleaning
medium
with
a
very
light
moderate
carbonation
nd
a
smooth
sorta
grainy
feel
overall
this
was
indeed
an
enjoyable
quad
its
decently
complex
and
the
alcohol
is
pretty
well
hidden
good
times
i
definitely
would
have
enjoyed
this
beer
far
more
had
it
not
been
so
boozy
on
the
back
end
perhaps
some
additional
aging
could
help
smooth
out
its
rough
edges
light
sweetness
was
the
first
to
arrive
with
a
good
base
of
malts
and
caramel
present
dark
fruit
flavors
all
hit
the
palate
with
some
raisin
and
figlike
notes
appearing
the
finish
was
on
the
dry
side
and
lent
a
fair
amount
of
bitterness
to
proceedings
decent
but
lacks
complexity
and
is
not
quite
worth
the
price
imo
prosit
1402
o
a
great
beer
but
not
a
great
quad
reviewing
the
beer
in
this
style
kills
it
a
quad
is
so
very
complex
and
this
isnt
in
comparison
with
the
greater
ones
still
a
fantastic
beer
though
o
one
of
the
better
quads
that
ive
had
complex
with
a
nice
level
of
sweetness
and
subtle
alcohol
a
good
solid
strong
belgian
very
good
with
hard
cheese
o
a
solid
quad
that
i
only
wish
was
more
available
andor
cheaper
a
much
sweeter
quad
with
highlights
of
toffee
raisin
and
figs
with
a
nice
spicy
compliment
a
pretty
good
beer
from
struise
that
id
love
to
try
in
a
bottle
o
very
mice
beer
i
wasnt
expecting
carbonation
is
a
little
high
and
bites
a
little
on
the
back
of
the
throat
otherwise
nice
many
thanks
for
this
bottle
thijs
and
for
the
one
i
still
have
i
really
enjoyed
the
cherry
flavors
in
this
beer
and
will
be
hunting
down
a
bottle
soon
st
amatus
has
a
very
pleasing
melange
of
flavors
and
its
a
satisfying
take
on
the
style
overall
a
fantastic
quad
fresh
compared
to
the
other
big
boys
fresh
it
is
one
of
if
not
my
favourite
o
drink
it
without
distraction
and
you
will
enjoy
even
better
to
my
opinion
this
is
one
of
the
best
beers
from
the
struise
brewers
worldclass
not
the
most
amazing
quad
more
intriguing
than
complex
but
well
integrated
and
not
cloyingly
sweet
o
i
was
excited
to
get
this
beer
excited
when
i
first
pouredsmelled
it
and
the
taste
came
through
very
happy
with
this
offering
solid
all
around
overall
not
like
anything
ive
had
before
a
really
tasty
beer
wish
i
had
more
overall
wow
this
is
complex
intriguing
maybe
even
confusing
each
person
drinking
this
was
almost
perplexed
by
the
flavor
that
is
a
winner
in
my
book
overall
nice
beer
but
i
prefer
the
pannepot
d
nice
but
i
wouldnt
seek
this
out
over
any
version
or
vintage
of
pannepot
o
this
a
a
good
beer
that
i
would
gladly
drink
again
dr
high
abv
hardly
shows
very
drinkable
err
sippable
for
the
abv
but
youd
want
to
slow
down
to
fully
appreciate
the
flavours
and
complexity
i
quite
fancy
it
give
her
a
go
lads
i
hope
the
price
isnt
too
high
because
id
quite
like
to
buy
it
for
the
future
another
fantastic
beer
from
struise
feel
is
a
bit
dryer
than
i
would
like
and
somewhat
thin
but
very
drinkable
i
really
like
this
beer
although
it
was
not
quite
as
rich
as
i
was
expecting
o
good
beer
tastes
a
hint
oxidized
and
maybe
a
little
too
sweet
overall
a
good
beer
that
i
would
like
to
age
but
unfortunately
the
beer
is
possibly
oxidized
at
several
monthes
and
im
not
sure
how
this
would
turn
out
in
a
couple
years
overall
im
not
as
impressed
as
i
wanted
to
be
nevertheless
this
is
certainly
a
solid
beer
let
er
warm
up
good
and
long
and
shell
do
you
well
cheers
o
in
a
vaccuum
this
is
a
great
beer
but
with
this
lineup
it
ranked
7
of
10
still
solid
but
not
super
drinkable
o
a
good
quad
wasnt
overly
outstanding
but
solid
o
nothing
wrong
with
it
a
perfectly
good
beer
but
nothing
great
about
it
either
somewhat
runofthemill
for
this
style
overall
good
beer
i
only
wish
it
was
cheaper
and
more
readily
available
to
me
this
is
such
a
fine
beer
ive
enjoyed
it
many
times
before
but
while
having
one
with
lunch
today
i
finally
got
around
to
leaving
a
review
its
pretty
drinkable
for
having
a
high
alcohol
content
partly
because
its
not
as
sweet
as
other
belgian
quads
o
this
is
a
delicious
offering
from
struise
that
doesnt
hold
to
the
standards
of
most
belgian
quads
but
its
so
complex
and
different
that
you
have
to
enjoy
it
this
is
a
must
try
for
anyone
drinkability
and
overall
impression
im
finding
this
one
quite
drinkable
sippable
and
would
have
no
problems
with
having
another
my
overall
impression
is
of
a
well
made
beer
that
would
respond
beautifully
to
a
few
years
of
bottle
aging
overall
a
great
beer
lots
of
soft
aged
malt
flavors
dark
fruits
cocoa
and
many
other
great
flavors
combined
in
the
complex
flavors
the
herbal
hops
add
a
weird
flavor
that
im
not
a
huge
fan
of
herbal
hop
addition
but
otherwise
a
nice
beer
d
exceptionally
easy
to
enjoy
a
lot
of
this
at
least
until
the
10
50
kicks
in
thanks
afictionado
d
very
high
for
a
12abv
beer
goes
down
easily
and
a
pleasure
to
drink
wished
i
had
another
admittedly
after
the
3
vintage
pannepots
it
would
be
a
challenge
for
the
young
st
amatus
to
match
up
but
i
am
definitely
going
to
cellar
one
for
a
few
years
and
see
how
it
performs
very
good
beer
nevertheless
id
rank
it
below
the
3
pannepots
and
above
the
la
trappes
in
my
quadrupel
marathon
remaining
beers
for
the
quadrupel
marathon

im
not
sure
where
the

abv
is
but
its
not
real
apparent
expertly
hidden
urbain
has
another
winner
here
enjoy
see
me
after
class
bottle
purchased
from
the
struise
yeast
store
pours
a
murky
brown
colour
with
hints
of
amber
a
finger
or
so
of
offwhite
head
nice
enough
head
retention
little
lacing
smells
of
dark
fruit
and
chocolate
with
some
mild
yeasty
aroma
and
maybe
a
hint
of
oak
flavour
has
a
slight
sweetness
to
it
medium
bodied
for
a
quad
i
enjoy
this
one
kens
bottle
from
struise
a
good
quad
sweetish
some
vegatable
notes
unfortunetely
a
bit
of
sage
on
the
finish
candi
on
the
aftertaste
a
little
chocolate
malt
a
tad
of
cherry
fruit
above
average
mouthfeel
medium
brown
colour
lace
alcohol
is
hidden
another
fine
struise
creation
poured
from
a
33ml
2010
vintage
bottle
into
a
heavy
chalice
glass
pours
a
hazy
amber
with
a
nice
medium
thin
off
white
head
that
left
lacing
throughout
my
drinking
session
aroma
of
toasted
malt
belgian
yeast
notes
light
roasted
malt
caramel
and
brown
sugar
flavor
of
caramel
dark
fruits
spicy
belgian
yeast
character
toffee
and
nuts
alcohol
well
hidden
medium
to
full
body
slightly
foamy
carbonation
warming
palate
it
is
a
nice
complex
beer
and
has
tremendous
aging
potential
i
look
forward
to
cellaring
my
extras
for
a
couple
more
years
and
do
another
review
then
overall
this
is
a
delicious
quad
well
done
struise
mouthfeel
this
beer
is
medium
bodied
with
a
lot
of
incredibly
fine
carbonation
this
makes
it
feel
extremely
pillowy
in
the
mouth
kind
of
like
drinking
a
cloud
ridiculous
drinkability
is
very
high
as
well
due
to
the
sheer
complexity
this
is
a
fantastic
quad
i
wish
i
had
access
to
it
all
the
time
d
good
full
flavored
easy
drinking
and
quite
complex
deep
mahogany
pour
with
a
large
loose
tan
head
rich
deep
dark
fruit
aroma
with
mellow
hints
of
cocoa
cinnamon
tobacco
alcohol
cloves
brown
sugar
vanilla
and
banana
loads
of
boozy
dark
fruit
upfront
in
the
flavor
with
lots
of
brandy
and
spice
the
middle
exhibits
some
sweet
brown
sugar
and
molasses
with
a
peppery
phenol
finish
and
lots
of
deep
dark
belgian
esters
sticky
medium
body
with
moderate
carbonation
this
is
a
great
quadrupel
and
i
am
drinking
this
too
fast
the
alcohol
is
very
well
hidden
d
very
good
and
a
bit
different
then
the
mainstay
quads
st
brochefortwestypannepot
i
think
some
age
might
smooth
some
of
the
rough
edges
here
and
turn
this
into
a
truly
sublime
beer
dthis
is
a
great
beer
probably
could
have
used
a
little
more
time
but
sat
on
the
bottle
for
6
months
and
wanted
it
for
xmas
beer
highly
recommended
love
to
get
more
thanks
for
this
one
jeff
d
this
is
a
really
easydrinking
quad
that
is
definitely
on
par
in
terms
of
quality
as
the
trappist
quads
albeit
distinct
in
other
ways
the
significantly
reduced
spice
and
anise
character
makes
this
a
little
easier
to
drink
than
pannepot
for
me
anyway
i
wish
i
had
ordered
more
bottles
picked
this
up
at
an
awesome
beer
store
outside
ghent
dranken
geers
dark
chocolate
colored
pour
with
one
finger
head
that
quickly
fades
with
minimal
lacing
the
nose
is
somewhat
subdued
but
very
unique
and
quite
hard
to
explain
lots
of
caramel
and
toffee
but
theres
an
underlying
spiciness
hints
of
nutmeg
and
cinnamon
with
a
little
bit
of
rum
and
coke
and
a
slight
metallic
tinge
that
all
gets
more
intense
as
it
warms
the
taste
is
far
from
subdued
complex
with
lots
of
dark
fruits
brown
sugar
vanilla
dark
chocolate
oak
with
hints
of
black
cherries
and
a
solid
sweet
malty
backbone
very
smooth
almost
creamy
with
a
nice
subtle
alcohol
warming
its
a
sipper
but
a
very
drinkable
sipper
not
sure
if
it
was
meant
to
be
an
interpretation
of
westy
12
but
its
definitely
in
that
class
another
world
class
beer
from
a
world
class
brewery
warming
complex
as
easy
to
put
down
as
welchs
white
grape
juice
a
personal
fave
id
give
that
one
an
a
no
hesitation
whats
not
to
like
id
put
this
one
up
in
my
pantheon
of
favorite
quads
of
all
time
westy
12
weyerbacher
quad
the
sixth
glass
on
the
border
of
a
masterpiece
the
body
is
medium
in
weight
with
excellent
carbonation
that
does
not
distract
but
instead
goes
perfectly
with
the
levels
of
flavors
some
slight
booze
dark
fruit
and
spices
linger
an
excellent
quad
that
drinks
like
an
8
is
it
as
good
as
westy
12
no
but
it
is
just
as
well
formulated
it
just
lacks
a
touch
of
the
complexity
medium
bodied
with
a
modest
amount
of
carbonation
quite
drinkable
despite
its
bold
presence
of
alcohol
once
this
brew
warms
up
it
has
a
lasting
belgian
style
yeast
spiciness
that
was
initially
muted
but
adds
a
nice
depth
to
this
brews
character
pours
deep
dark
red
the
dominant
aromas
are
of
dark
fruit
and
vanilla
with
notes
of
roasted
malt
cinnamon
nutmeg
and
caramel
the
beer
does
not
reveal
much
belgian
character
and
rather
strives
for
more
western
flavors
of
oakiness
and
roastiness
look
for
dates
and
grapes
on
the
palette
feel
is
wet
another
great
beer
by
de
struise
greatly
different
from
pannepot
and
some
ways
superior
probably
could
age
well
but
is
fine
to
drink
now
worth
tracking
down
jd
overall
a
worldclass
brew
this
could
be
a
4
beer
given
how
well
hidden
the
alcohol
was
ive
had
my
share
of
quads
and
this
is
the
most
drinkable
interpretation
of
the
style
by
far
the
alcohol
lends
itself
to
the
flavor
profile
and
doesnt
make
a
boozy
appearance
at
all
though
the
flavor
profile
was
wonderful
it
wasnt
quite
as
bold
as
the
nose
had
indicated
which
put
it
down
a
notch
from
a
perfect
score
that
said
i
can
certainly
see
why
many
have
dubbed
this
better
than
the
westvleteren
12
im
still
on
the
fence
personally
and
will
need
a
sidebyside
pretty
soon
regardless
this
is
another
fantastic
brew
form
a
world
class
brewery
thanks
guys
the
beer
tastes
quite
sweet
as
it
hits
the
palate
but
much
of
this
comes
from
the
base
fruitiness
and
the
sweet
accentuating
spiciness
that
is
found
in
this
beer
the
finish
is
dry
with
a
spicy
note
as
well
as
a
touch
of
astringency
the
fruit
flavors
found
here
remind
me
of
bright
plums
tartsweet
raisins
and
even
some
fig
notes
add
to
the
complexity
flavors
of
rum
or
perhaps
more
properly
characterized
as
brandy
flavors
are
brought
out
by
the
sweetness
the
fruit
character
and
the
alcohol
this
is
really
quite
nicely
balanced
between
the
fruit
character
the
alcohol
the
earthy
spiciness
and
the
candi
sugar
flavors
this
has
the
proper
character
needed
of
being
light
and
quaffable
for
its
strength
it
is
still
most
definitely
a
sipping
beer
but
it
is
not
overly
heavy
or
cloying
the
sipping
also
allows
one
to
fully
experience
the
complexity
and
myriad
of
balanced
flavors

overall
taste

also
a

very
well
brewed
with
great
mix
between
complexity
and
drinkability
though
a
bit
more
carbonation
would
have
improved
this
beer
imho
taste
is
quite
convincing
creamy
complex
yet
imho
more
straight
forward
stronger
than
a
roch
10
or
a
westy
12
what
was
in
the
nose
was
also
in
the
taste
added
with
bourbon
barrel
coffee
too
very
well
done
great
quad
just
not
that
well
known
but
not
too
far
of
a
westy
12
or
roch
10
at
all
wonder
what
this
will
do
with
a
bit
of
age
on
it
could
become
more
smooth
and
wouldt
harm
at
all
could
make
it
perfect
overall
as
solid
as
a
quad
as
i
have
had
in
recent
memory
simply
sublime
d
good
carbonation
smooth
and
a

creamy
some
hints
of
oak

in

nice

the
is
really
nice
so
enjoyable
to

packed
with
great

love

decent
amount

large
amount
of
dark

alongside
some
candied

a

initial
sip
brings
a
slightlydry
beer
with
some
sweetness
and
dominated
mostly
by
dark
fruits
body
is
medium
a
good
beer
in
its
own
right
but
nowhere
near
the
best
of
this
style
i
wonder
how
well
this
beer
would
age
its
sweet
but
not
hot
finishes
cleanly
a
great
great
beer
truly
its
medium

light

the
carbonation
on

is
low
mild
stone
fruits
mild
bread
mild
yeast
very
nice
balance
overall
the
alcohol
is
well
hidden
behind
a
mask
of
great
malt
i
really
enjoyed
it
the
beer
appears
a
dark
brown
shade
darker
than
the
pannepot
with
a
fleeting
light
tan
head
a
minimal
amount
of
lacing
is
left
behind
the
aroma
is
wonderful
and
obviously
of
an
authentic
belgian
quad
i
detect
yeast
bread
subtle
dark
fruits
and
slight
alcohol
the
taste
is
great
and
surprisingly
smooth
especially
given
that
this
beer
is
newly
released
thus
quite
young
the
finish
contains
a
slight
warming
note
with
only
a
faint
trace
of
alcohol
the
10
5
abv
is
hidden
quite
well
what
a
delicious
beer
this
is
practically
as
smooth
as
the
2005
pannepot
i
am
amazed
that
this
beer
drinks
this
well
already
a
true
masterpiece
de
struise

proves
yet
again
that
it
is
one
of
the
finest
breweries
around
urbain
is
making
some
of
the
finest
belgian
belgian
beer
in
the
world
flavor
and
mouthfeel
is
wonderful
very
drinkable
for
a
heavy
quad
extremely
smooth
high

boozy
and
just
delicious
medium

toasted

lots
of
overripe
fruits
like

and
im
picking
up

regardless
just
a
great
tasting
beer
from
de
struise
glad
i
got
to
try
it
poured
a
dark
brown
into
a
special
sint
amatus
chalice
with
a
little
bit
of
foamy
head
could
have
dranken
3
or
4
of
these
easily
before
i
would
break
my
bank
and
happily
stumble
out
of
the
bar
i
wish
i
had
taken
notes
on
all
the
tastes
but
unfortunately
didnt
between
passing
the
beer
around
with
my
family
whom
all
said
it
was
awesome
even
a
non
beer
drinker
if
i
ever
see
in
stores
in
the
states
i
would
happily
pay
whatever
the
cost
was
all
in
all
an
amazing
beer
and
by
far
the
best
quad
ive
had
to
date
drinkability
very
very
good
excellent
beer
a
must
try
for
the
belgian
quadstrong
dark
ale
enthusiast
i
thoroughly
enjoyed
this
beer
i
may
never
drink
another
but
i
am
glad
i
got
to
try
this
one
d
quite
a
good
beer
from
de
struise
and
i
think
this
one
would
be
great
to
enjoy
on
a
cold
evening
as
it
was
not
exactly
perfect
on
a
90
afternoon
but
still
tasty
thanks
very
much
to
jedwards
for
sharing
this
ive
been
wanting
to
try
this
one
for
a
while
poured
a
hazy
plum
with
an
offwhite
skim
of
a
head
that
dissipates
into
some
bubbles
around
the
edges
nose
reveals
bubblegum
dark
fruit
and
a
little
booze
taste
follows
nose
not
as
sweet
as
suggested
by
the
aromas
but
the
booze
definitely
carries
over
to
the
flavor
profile
mouthfeel
is
medium
in
body
with
a
light
carbonation
and
a
slightly
dry
finish
definitely
a
solid
quad
not
overly
sweet
and
wellbalanced
well
worth
your
time
if
you
get
the
chance
to
give
it
a
try
considering
the
10
50
abv
the
alcohol
is
pretty
well
hidden
d
another
great
offering
from
de
struise
i
drank
this
wonderfull
beer
last
night
for
the
5th
time
and
it
stays
one
of
my
favourites
first
sip
and
wow
this
is
a
tasty
beer
huge
roasted
malts
caramel
flavors
bourbon
dried
fruit
a
brief
sour
note
the
body
is
thick
and
velvety
carbonation
is
light
a
second
sip
shows
more
of
the
barrel
aging
you
can
really
taste
it
some
brown
sugar
a
molasses
flavor
is
very
present
kind
of
a
sweet
beer
but
not
sugary
sweet
flavor
makes
you
lick
your
lips
more
bourbon
shows
up
in
the
finish
the
aftertaste
is
molasses
like
and
lingers
i
imagine
this
to
be
a
perfect
desert
beer
after
a
big
heavy
meal
for
10
5
abv
the
alcohol
is
well
hidden
a
nice
tribute
to
trappist
quads
but
the
evident
alcohol
presence
sets
a
gap
between
the
genuine
trappists
and
struises
attempt
of
mimicking
the
monks
work
however
the
beer
is
still
young
and
the
remaining
bottles
might
significantly
improve
with
aging
this
one
drinks
very
nicely
for
the
abv
i
wouldnt
say
that
i
am
blown
away
by
this
but
it
still
is
a
very
good
quad
that
improves
consistently
with
each
degree
that
it
warms
this
is
also
very
young
and
i
hate
to
judge
this
style
based
on
a
fresh
bottle
but
that
is
all
i
have
right
now
as
it
warms
it
gets
a
bit
sweeter
but
the
alcohol
still
doesnt
seem
to
pile
up
still
a
rich
flavorful
sipper
another
big
struise
hit
this
is
a
masterpiece
im
truly
in
love
i
bought
5
bottles
but
now
i
just
got
to
get
hold
of
a
couple
more
the
bourbon
taste
and
smell
was
very
pronounced
the
alcohol
tastesmell
was
so
overwhelming
it
tasted
like
tequila
aroma
of
raisins
honey
faint
vinous
caramel
candy
spice
taste
cooked
sugar
wood
faint
vanilla
figs
dry
finish
excellent

cloudy
dirty
brown

with
a
large
foamy
head
with
ok
retention
and
some
lacing
aroma
of
dry
fruits
with
some
bourbon
notes
and
some
residual
sugars
is
quite
complex
taste
is
a
complex
mix
of
bourbon
with
light
residual
candi
sugar
with
some
fruity
ester
and
some
dry
fruits
notes
body
is
about
average
with
good
carbonation
and
no
apparent

nice
level
of
complexity
thought
a
fuller
body
would
have
help
appreciate
this
even
more

along
with

pretty
complex

that
i
cant
really
nail
down

is
mediumbodied
a
little
sticky
the
booze
is
hidden
but
after
awhile
hits
you
as
beer
warms
some
typical
belgian
yeast
and
citric
zip
come
in
as
well
and
there
is
some
moderate
sweetness
with
a
blend
of
sour
that
i
get
a
really
enjoyable
quad
that
the
aging
has
smoothed
out
and
sweetned
and
is
a
great
sipper
this
is
not
meant
to
be
more
than
a
sipper
picked
this
up
at
bierhandel
willems
en
zoon
in
belgium
beautiful
clear
mahogany
pour
with
a
two
finger
offwhite
head
with
decent
retention
and
nice
lacing
the
nose
is
amazing
with
huge
vanilla
bourbon
and
oak
notes
along
with
hints
of
butterscotch
orange
peel
caramel
brown
sugar
and
subtle
dark
fruit
the
taste
mirrors
the
nose
with
the
oak
vanilla
and
bourbon
once
again
the
stars
hints
of
maple
caramel
pecans
leather
tangerine
figs
applebrown
sugar
and
booze
the
mouthfeel
is
lightly
syrupy
with
perfect
carbonation
and
a
smooth
as
silk
subtly
warming
finish
overall
this
is
an
amazing
beer
its
rich
and
flavorful
and
hugely
drinkable
for
an
11
abv
beer
ive
had
this
numerous
times
on
tap
but
this
is
the
first
time
from
the
bottle
i
have
to
say
its
just
as
good
and
perhaps
has
mellowed
a
bit
in
the
cellar
for
me
this
is
a
barley
wine
disguised
as
a
quad
highly
recommended
o
a
really
nice
beer
the
age
and
perhaps
the
barrels
have
made
this
delightfully
balanced
complex
and
not
particularly
boozy
though
quite
sweet
as
most
quads
are
overall
good
beer
way
different
take
on
the
quad
worth
a
try
especially
if
you
dont
really
like
quads
but
like
tripels
doesnt
feel
four
years
old
but
the
age
is
noticed
and
probably
why
everything
has
balanced
out
so
nicely
like
the
mix
of
the
bourbon
and
wine
feel
o
this
is
easily
one
of
the
best
beers
ive
tried
this
year
and
is
perhaps
one
of
the
best
quadrupels
ive
ever
had
the
flavors
are
gorgeously
balanced
and
the
alcohol
is
not
so
overpowering
that
it
is
difficult
to
drink
the
guys
at
de
struise
have
really
created
something
marvelous
here
highly
recommended
to
fans
of
belgian
ales
and
strong
ales
in
general
interesting
mix
of
sweet
sharp
savory
and
bitter
a
little
hot
but
fairly
complex
somewhat
sweet
overall
a
big
boozy
heavy
hitter
go
slowly
with
this
jd
overall
least
impressive
of
struise
quads
wanted
this
to
be
much
more
o
an
unusual
quad
this
one
i
still
think
there
are
many
better
examples
out
there
but
try
it
for
something
different
o
a
unique
quad
with
the
heavy
etoh
character
but
it
was
never
hot
and
it
was
an
interesting
beer
to
try
though
if
you
want
this
at
its
peak
id
say
give
it
another
5
years
this
is
great
hectic
in
the
best
possible
way
3
5
d
very
interesting
beer
that
is
worth
a
try
i
doubt
id
buy
another
bottle
if
i
had
the
chance
though
but
im
glad
i
got
this
one
the
bourbon
is
a
bit
at
odds
with
the
fruity
notes
but
at
least
its
a
unique
experience
the
unusual
take
to
turn
the
dark
belgian
ale
blonde
leaves
the
beer
tasting
much
like
classic
belgian
dubbel
ales
but
with
the
power
and
complexity
of
quadrupel
ales
the
results
remind
me
of
founders
nemesis
09
except
with
far
superior
results
what
stays
is
the
smell
of
the
beer
and
its
darkyellow
colour
very
nice
mouthfeel
the
beer
has
to
warm
up
a
little
but
then
it
shows
its
quality
next
time
i
have
to
get
me
a
fresher
glass
o
surprising
tasty
heavy
and
refreshing
all
in
one
beer
the
usual
wonderful
balance
from
struise
weve
got
a
winner
mouthfeel
is
rich
and
smooth
with
a
warming
alcohol
presence
this
quad
is
well
worth

this
is
a

d
really
nice

this
is
probably
the
best
american
brewed
example
of
the
style
i
have
had
overall
nice
quad
not
too
sweet
which
is
something
that
usually
turns
me
off
from
other
quads
i
have
had
i
would
like
more
dark
fruit
from
this
one
though
o
southampton
may
have
lost
a
step
recently
but
beers
like
this
make
me
look
forward
to
trying
them
a
really
good
local
belgian
quad
that
could
serve
better
with
some
age
on
it
overall
i
find
i
like
this
beer
the
more
i
drink
it
sure
its
sweet
but
the
flavor
profile
justifies
that
completely
yum
there
was
some
good
flavor
in
this
beer
but
it
was
very
flat
making
it
kind
of
unpleasant
o
lousy
belgian
quad
decent
american
quad
the
yeast
was
more
of
a
player
than
i
am
used
to
and
there
was
an
odd
semi
roasted
thing
going
on
but
all
of
the
above
created
a
nice
twist
for
an
american
interpretation
mediumfull
bodied
with
solid
carbonation
a
little
bit
fizzy
and
less
profound
in
feeling
than
the
best
of
the
style
finish
dries
out
a
bit
which
helps
things
along
not
a
top
notch
quad
but
not
bad
either
original
review
on
07092010
overall
a
tasty
quad
on
the
heavy
side
and
could
use
some
more
pep
to
it
dont
think
i
would
ever
mind
sipping
on
it
through
still
not
sure
why
this
brewery
doesnt
get
the
gleaming
notoriety
it
deserves
o
considering
its
strength
this
beer
is
quite
easy
to
drink
because
the
alcohol
is
well
hidden
from
the
taste
o
the
alcohol
in
this
beer
is
really
well
hidden
which
is
great
considering
the
abv
i
really
enjoyed
this
beer
and
think
it
is
a
really
good
example
of
the
style
a
beer
i
would
enjoy
sipping
all
afternoon
long
i
would
say
my
favorite
in
this
category
big
rum
soaked
raisins
that
really
let
you
know
that
you
were
in
for
it
here
this
was
balanced
by
a
nice
touch
of
alcohol
and
thick
walloping
of
yeast
that
gave
off
all
sorts
of
fruity
like
esters
the
hints
of
fig
and
pear
were
big
as
was
the
nice
amount
of
sweetness
that
was
added
in
to
try
and
pull
it
all
together
nice
spicy
rum
like
flavor
that
was
intermingled
and
laced
with
lots
of
dark
fruits
nice
flavors
of
raisins
figs
and
prunes
were
evident
as
was
a
decent
amount
of
sweetness
added
to
the
mix
the
mouthfeel
is
on
the
heavier
side
with
carbonation
being
on
the
higher
side
overall
it
was
a
very
nice
beer
of
the
style
it
showcased
the
malts
really
nicely
and
was
also
very
drinkable
for
the
style
and
abv
very
enjoyable
beer
overall
this
is
a
full
bodied
brew
with
a
modest
level
of
carbonation
it
is
fairly
easy
drinking
with
quite
a
bit
of
earthy
tones
theoughut
the
profile
not
a
bad
take
on
the
style
but
a
little
forgettable
perhaps
this
is
my
own
fault
for
the
sheer
amount
of
dark
belgian
beers
ive
been
drinking
lately
this
one
just
didnt
stand
out
at
all

sweet
raisins
a
touch
of
roast
a

phenols
cola
clove
pecans

some

impart
a
moderate
bitterness
the
body
is
lightish
crisp
and
dry
with
lots
of
carbonation
and
a
bitterroastyfruity
linger
this
is
an
absolutely
wonderful
beer
that
is
quite
wellbrewed
and
dangerously
drinkable
my
only
quibble
is
that
it
is
a
touch
sweet
but
even
with
that
the
beer
remains
wellbalanced
without
question
one
of
the
best
quadrupels
brewed
on
this
side
of
the
atlantic
highly
recommended
overall
a
decent
quad
but
nothing
out
of
the
ordinary
tastes
like
a
quad
not
much
else
to
say
overall
i
havent
had
many
belgian
style
quads
and
of
the
ones
i
have
had
westy
12
it
seems
unfair
to
rate
this
along
with
them
decent
beer
not
bad
for
the
style
glad
i
got
to
drink
this
at
the
event
after
having
it
however
there
is
no
way
i
will
ever
pick
up
a
bottle
given
the
average
retail
price
on
this
one
there
are
just
better
and
cheaper
options
this
is
a
sipper
but
a
good
one
flavors
tend
toward
the
sweet
end
of
the
spectrum
but
well
within
expectations
for
a
quad
would
be
a
nice
one
to
have
around
for
the
holidays
o
pretty
solid
i
got
it
down
easily
and
the
alcohol
may
just
be
too
well
hidden
i
poured
from
a
bomber
into
a
snifter
dark
brown
pour
with
a
big
white
head
light
lacing
the
aroma
is
full
of
sweet
dark
fruitdates
and
plums
and
alcohol
the
flavors
are
very
sweet
dark
fruit
and
hot
alcohol
it
finishes
hot
and
sweet
the
body
is
full
good
carbonation
even
though
it
is
very
sweet
i
liked
it
the
combination
of
flavors
really
worked
for
me
this
beer
has
some
pretty
mixed
reviews
perhaps
there
is
some
deviation
in
bottles
andor
batches
i
know
the
bottle
i
am
enjoying
is
fantastic
this
is
without
question
the
best
american
quad
i
have
had
o
this
is
my
first
beer
from
southampton
and
wow
this
is
world
class
being
a
big
belgian
tripel
and
quad
fan
this
ranks
right
up
there
w
the
best
of
them
for
me
the
first
american
quad
ive
tried
that
i
can
say
that
about
it
might
not
be
my
favorite
but
its
real
close
fantastic
and
definitely
worth
a
purchase
i
know
ill
be
picking
this
one
up
whenever
i
see
it
cheers
drinkability
is
high
on
this
one
it
is
a
really
good
quad
and
i
would
love
to
get
my
hands
on
some
more
so
i
can
cellar
it
for
awhile
solid
beer
all
around
overall
probably
one
of
the
best
american
quads
really
well
done
high
sweetness
pulls
down
the
drinkability
slightly
id
like
to
try
this
one
again
overall
not
what
i
look
for
in
a
belgian
dark
too
sweet
with
combined
higher
alcohol
d
not
a
session
beer
of
course
but
for
the
style
very
drinkable
this
is
a
clear
brown
ale
with
a
wonderfully
dense
lighttan
head
the
aroma
is
moderately
malty
with
a
dark
fruit
bubblegum
clove
and
spices
it
could
be
a
little
more
intense
but
is
very
complex
wonderful
flavor
lots
of
complex
layered
malts
very
sweet
almost
sugary
in
the
foretaste
the
beer
however
dries
out
nicely
in
the
finish
appropriate
full
body
but
lots
of
carbonation
small
bubbles
very
very
drinkable
d
almost
like
a
really
strong
dubbel
tasty
a
little
woody
nice
a
terrible
attempt
at
one
of
my
favourite
types
of
beer
true
to
its
intended
abbey
heritage
ive
found
this
beer
makes
a
wonderful
pairing
with
simple
monk
foods
hearty
grainy
breads
salty
cheeses
and
dried
fruits
indeed
a
little
salt
goes
a
long
way
in
sedating
the
beers
malignant
sweetness
without
the
grub
its
still
worth
downing
but
be
sure
to
bring
a
big
sweettooth
youll
need
it
d
its
not
too
hard
to
drink
but
pairing
a
heavy
body
with
quite
a
bit
of
alcohol
heat
as
it
warms
makes
this
sipper
a
bit
harder
to
finish
than
most
others
of
the
same
style
d
this
is
an
interesting
quad
it
was
incredibly
sweet
and
malty
not
my
favorite
quad
drinkability
this
was
a
very
pleasant
and
polished
quadrupel
though
not
great
in
any
category
justin
and
i
really
enjoyed
it
all
the
way
through
a
fireside
sipper
or
would
be
great
with
grilled
mediumrare
lamb
chops
d
this
was
a
good
beer
but
surprisingly
not
malty
it
had
great
body
but
it
was
pretty
hot
fresh
so
it
was
definitely
a
sipper
age
would
probably
really
help
improve
this
beer
as
it
was
a
little
rough
fresh
d
reasonably
drinkable
but
needs
more
age
it
is
hot
and
slightly
harsh
when
cold
and
it
is
slightly
rough
when
warm
cellar
temp
worked
best
for
taste
drinkability
numerous
750ml
bottles
each
bottle
changes
in
character
in
particular
the
sweetness
variable
first
pour
is
dark
mahogany
with
coca
cola
cherry
red
highlighst
and
a
really
big
head
hard
to
get
a
grasp
of
all
the
flavor
components
but
theres
alot
of
rich
sweet
mal
and
dark
fruits
raisins
prunes
sweet
figs
and
caramel
butterscotch
candy
a
bit
of
rum
creeps
in
the
second
pour
is
much
cloudier
as
with
all
750
southamptons
thick
and
chewy
an
elegant
abbeystyle
quadruple
theres
a
faint
sense
of
oak
and
hickory
in
there
but
the
swetness
takes
that
over
the
mouthfeel
could
be
creamier
especially
near
the
top
of
the
bottle
mouthfeel
is
effervescent
and
fitting
this
is
a
great
beer
i
wish
i
could
get
it
all
the
time
in
ohio
d
great
for
its
strength
the
beer
pours
a
very
dark
brown
with
hints
of
plum
around
the
edges
if
held
up
to
light
a
decent
but
not
overly
impressive
tan
head
rises
and
leaves
a
fair
amount
of
lacing
though
head
retention
is
a
little
bit
weak
the
nose
has
the
expected
dark
fruit
flavors
but
theres
also
much
more
of
a
spicy
yeast
presence
which
is
somewhat
intriguing
the
taste
is
a
little
bit
of
a
letdown
as
yeasty
spiciness
from
the
nose
disappears
and
the
remaining
malt
sweetness
tastes
a
little
watered
down
though
still
far
from
bad
theres
a
brief
flash
of
alcohol
warmth
at
the
very
end
of
each
sip
the
carbonation
level
is
fine
but
as
the
taste
hinted
at
the
body
of
the
beer
is
a
little
thin
overall
its
a
pretty
drinkable
beer
though
its
got
a
good
flavor
and
the
alcohol
presence
serves
to
add
to
the
taste
and
avoids
being
harsh
in
any
way
southampton
abbot
12
is
a
good
beer
but
for
my
money
a
well
executed
quad
is
one
of
the
best
beers
on
the
planet
and
this
just
doesnt
quite
measure
up
to
that
lofty
standard
mouthfeel
is
okay
full
bodied
medium
carbonation
scores
high
in
drinkability
i
will
be
coming
back
for
more
after
the
onenote
borderline
disaster
of
southampton
grand
cru
i
was
afraid
to
try
this
beer
i
expected
it
would
either
be
too
simple
or
taste
like
cola
i
was
pleasantly
surprised
to
find
an
american
quad
that
rivals
allagash
4
in
terms
of
feel
taste
and
aroma
southamptons
quad
is
not
in
the
same
league
as
saint
bernardus
or
trappistes
rochefort
but
its
a
good
beer
ill
be
happy
to
have
this
one
again
and
might
throw
one
in
the
cellar
to
see
what
happens
poured
a
cloudy
brown
color
with
a
large
frothy
offwhite
head
that
mostly
lasted
with
good
lacing
moderate
tart
citrus
and
brown
sugar
aroma
medium
to
full
body
with
a
sticky
texture
and
fizzy
carbonation
heavy
bittersweet
flavor
with
a
medium
to
heavy
bittersweet
finish
of
moderate
duration
good
complex
brew
smooth
mouthfeel
good
carbonation
and
goes
down
easy
a
real
tasty
american
quad
and
a
bit
sad
i
dont
have
any
more
bottles
of
this
as
i
think
it
would
last
a
few
more
years
in
the
cellar
without
issue
another
winner
from
southampton
wow
impressed
very
sweet
and
complex
full
bodied
with
tons
of
raisins
and
caramel
notes
heavy
sweet
malts
and
definite
booze
great
beer
looks
soda
like
near
opaque
dark
redish
brown
with
a
small
head
which
quickly
becomes
a
thin
sticky
lacin
smell
is
deep
with
sweet
dark
fruits
grapes
cherry
vanilla
soda
taste
is
super
sweet
syrupy
and
sugary
thick

again
heavy
on
the

its
an
enjoyable
slow
sipper
a
bit
too
sweet
in
my
opinion
but
no
complaints
as
i
enjoy
the
rest
of
the
bottle
carbonation
is
good
not
too
much
not
too
little
slightly
warming
alcohol
probably
will
wait
a
while
before
i
get
this
again
but
its
certainly
a
great
brew
cheers
the
beer
pours
a
translucent
brown
color
with
a
14
offwhite
head
that
slowly
fades
to
lacing
the
aroma
is
great
it
has
a
warm
crystal
and
roasted
malt
scent
along
with
a
wondeful
yeast
aroma
it
has
some
awesome
dark
fruit
scents
the
taste
is
good
it
has
a
smooth
crystal
malt
flavor
that
goes
down
easy
and
finishes
warm
with
some
excellent
yeast
esters
its
a
well
balanced
beer
with
great
yeast
character
and
moderate
warmth
the
mouthfeel
is
fine
it
is
a
full
bodied
beer
with
adequate
carbonation
this
is
a
very
nice
belgian
style
ale
it
highly
drinkable
and
enjoyable
very
enjoyable
i
like
this
final
thoughts
its
delicious
but
a
little
too
sweet
which
takes
away
from
its
drinkability
if
it
was
fermented
a
touch
more
it
would
be
really
good
i
have
a
couple
more
bottles
that
i
will
leave
to
age
for
a
couple
years
and
see
how
they
turn
out
d
i
am
not
a
fan
too
darn
sweet
to
really
get
into
im
glad
that
janlud
was
here
to
share
it
with
me
pours
a
rich
opaque
brown
with
a
big
creamy
head
only
if
poured
very
vigorously
though
smell
is
sweet
has
bits
of
alcohol
and
light
chocolate
the
taste
is
very
rich
again
sweet
with
caramelized
sugars
and
a
very
slight
toast
or
roast
there
is
perhaps
a
light
fruitiness
wayyyy
in
the
background
mouthfeel
is
a
nice
medium
about
what
i
would
expect
in
a
belgian
quadrupel
this
is
a
good
beer
to
be
drank
in
small
quantities
opened
a
2006
vintage
i
have
been
keeping
in
the
cellar
for
over
3
years
now
as
soon
as
i
twisted
the
wire
off
the
cork
went
flying
with
little
more
than
a
touch
and
a
loud
champagneesque
pop
poured
a
beautiful
dark
brown
color
with
a
dense
but
small
offwhite
head
big
aromas
of
malt
and
sugary
fruit
flavor
was
much
of
the
same
with
very
rich
alcohol
soaked
fruit
raisins
and
figs
being
the
dominate
notes
the
beer
has
aged
very
well
but
because
of
the
richness
i
found
the
drinkability
to
be
somewhat
low
an
excellent
after
dinner
drink
or
one
to
enjoy
on
a
cold
winters
night
this
was
every
bit
as
good
for
me
as
st
bernardus
and
rochefort
a
winner
drinkability
is
awesome
in
this
beer
for
something
with
such
a
large
abv
there
is
little
to
no
taste
of
alcohol
at
all
this
beer
has
some
really
awesome
tastes
and
they
all
go
down
very
nice
this
was
clearly
a
bad
bottle
but
ill
stick
with
my
review
until
i
can
find
a
good
one
to
try
the
aroma
and
taste
were
clear
indications
of
a
very
good
quad
underneath
but
this
one
had
completely
lost
its
carbonation
d
a
nice
drinkable
quad
but
if
i
had
a
bottle
it
would
probably
be
best
split
among
friends
i
heard
rumblings
that
this
was
a
07
version
even
though
it
was
listed
as
08
well
it
sure
drinks
like
an
07
d
alone
id
have
scored
a
little
lower
more
sugary
than
i
prefer
paired
with
food
however
this
quad
did
well
aged
gouda
colston
bassett
stilton
cured
salamis
and
ripe
pear
all
performed
well
with
this
the
gouda
was
especially
good
we
actually
cut
it
into
long
strips
swizzle
sticks
to
dredge
through
this
beer
wouldnt
mind
having
another
bottle
for
round
2
sweet
residual
sugary
fruitiness
cherries
and
prunes
followed
by
a
mild
finecarbonated
tongue
scrubbing
and
finishes
off
with
a
nice
alcohol
warming
and
mildly
toasty
bitterness
pretty
tasty
quad
wish
i
had
another
to
cellar
for
awhile
nice
smooth

spend

glad
i
did
not
waste
a
ticket
on
it
at
the
festival
a
week
before
might
be
worth
trying
but
do
not
expect
much
d
a
farily
good
quad
that
has
a
rich
fruity
complexity
i
had
a
hard
time
finishing
because
of
the
abv
and
the
growing
tartness
towards
the
end
more
on
the
bitterside

something
i
will
pull
for
again

i
know
what
ill
be
loading
up
on
when
i
go
to
ebf
2009
d
it
is
a
fine
and
solid
quad
that
stands
tall
among
its
style
brewed
in
the
new
world
i
like
and
intend
to
keep
it
in
my
stash
for
special
times
d
a
decent
interpretation
of
a
belgian
quad
but
a
little
too
sweet
for
me
the
taste
and
mouthfeel
of
this
beer
takes
the
drinkability
down
some
cheers
overall
this
was
an
absolutely
amazing
beer
it
is
a
great
representation
of
the
style
and
one
i
would
love
to
have
again
bottle
from
andy
in
ny
via
a
trade
after
removing
the
cage
and
prying
out
the
firmly
seated
cork
this
poured
a
deep
red
to
amber
color
with
virtually
no
head
nose
of
sweet
caramel
malts
and
ripe
fruit
very
greasy
mouthfeel
more
like
port
wine
than
beer
flavor
is
quite
sweet
with
raisins
finish
is
long
sweet
and
full
of
malts
kind
of
a
sipping
beer
but
was
as
good
at
the
finish
as
at
the
end
overall
very
nice
d
on
the
sweet
side
but
somehow
it
works
in
this
beer
not
as
complex
as
others
i
have
had
but
there
is
something
very
tasty
about
this
one
this
is
a
crisp
dark
brown
beer
taste
is
interesting
hints
of
walnuts
and
brown
sugar
roasty
characteristics
very
sweet
nose
due
to
the
hints
of
brown
sugar
surprisingly
clean
finish
would
do
this
beer
again
just
the
fact
that
the
taste
is
roasty
is
fulfilling
and
southampton
has
quite
a
few
good
brews
in
its
lineup
please
add
this
one
drinkability
pretty
disappointing
overall
not
sure
what
happened
with
this
batch
but
some
quality
control
needs
to
be
considered
before
releasing
it
a
real
shame
coming
from
an
otherwise
great
brewery
this
beer
has
a
great
nose
but
the
carbonation
is
way
low
for
the
style
and
the
pallet
is
overly
sweet
definitely
a
solid
american
sample
of
a
quad
but
when
compared
to
some
european
versions
nothing
above
and
beyond
one
of
the
more
drinkable
quadrupels
ive
ever
had
on
account
of
the
tamed
alcohol
character
reserved
carbonation
and
complex
yet
balanced
flavor
profile
congrats
to
southampton
this
ones
a
success
overall
a
very
strange
brew
and
definitely
not
a
good
representation
of
the
style
the
label
indicates
that
it
was
brewed
in
royersford
pa
which
would
mean
that
its
sly
fox
contract
brewed
so
im
not
sure
how
this
compares
to
the
original
however
sf
did
do
a
good
job
on
the
brewers
art
bottles
so
im
not
sure
what
went
wrong
here
tastes
rather
sweet
but
nice
becomes
fruitier
after
a
few
gulps
and
warming

the

echoes

raisins

dates
are
very
prominent
followed
by
caramels
booze
and
a
syrupy
sweetness
that
verged
on
overpowering
booze
and
sweetness
become
more
and
more
of
defining
characteristic
with
warming
somewhat
dry
and
sticky
finish
due
to
high

this
would
benefit
from
cellaring
mildly

first
deception
with
southampton
which
is
otherwise
an
amazing
brewery
drinkability
we
drain
poured
this
as
we
had
a
couple
other
beers
we
felt
would
better
treat
our
palette
im
sure
this
beer
is
good
if
not
great
when
fresh
not
sure
why
two
years
of
age
would
have
harmed
this
beer
overall
this
was
not
as
good
as
i
would
want
it
to
be
perhaps
it
needs
about
3
years
of
aging
to
help
it
calm
down
a
bit
but
i
wont
be
going
back
for
another
bottle
to
see
if
thats
the
case
i
am
grateful
that
i
didnt
have
to
pay
for
this
bottle
a
disappointment
see
weare138s

i
believe
im
also
drinking
a
sly
fox

ive
had
in
my
cellar
for
a
while
a
somewhat
unpleasant
drink
cloyingly
sweet

the
sort
of

brew
i
used
to
enjoy
from
southampton
not
worth
the

dark
orange
brown
in

fizzy

the
head
works

and
leaves

the
smell
is
sweet
with
plums
raisins
and
some
other
dark
fruits
some
candied
sugar
is
rather
apparent
the
flavor
is
big
and
belgian
with
some
almost
overly
sweet
malts
raisins
belgian
spices
and
yeast
the
alcohol
is
apparent
but
not
overly
so
the
mouthfell
is
thick

sticky
and
this
was
an
easy
bomber
to
finish
on
my
own
a
good
quad
the
best
i
can
remember
that
dosent
come

seems
like
it
would
benefit
from
slightly
higher
attenuation

the
strange
lemon
astringent
aroma
i
smelled
that
i
noted
seems
to
be
found
in
a
lot
of
southamptons
beers
it
could
be
due
to
a
common
yeast
used
in
many
of
there
beers
anyone
have
any
thoughts
overall
this
is
a
good
beer
from
a
great
brewery
however
i
am
not
really
into
beers
that
could
be
put
in
the
dessert
category
unless
they
are
drank
in
the
right
context
i
think
i
would
like
it
better
if
it
were
more
highly
attenuated
id
give
it
more
than
just
one
more
try
though
first
off
i
love
the
cork
and
caged
bottles
im
glad
phil
and
brian
are
working
together
to
get
these

prickly
carbonation
as
it
settles
after
the
big

a
creamy
effect
takes
over
as
it
warms
up
a
bit
leaving
just
a
touch
of
residual
sugars
bringing
out
some
stickiness
drinkability
drink
some
more
now
but
has
so
much
promise
to
become
amazing
with
some
sleep

quadrupel
worthy
of
the
hype
and

southampton
is
known
for

than
some
of

flava
was
mighty
complex
wow
this
has
some
of
the
heaviest
apple
esters
ive
tasted
in
this
style
apple
cinnamon
oatmeal
comes
to
mind
some
pears
coming
through
again
in
the
flavor
balanced
lingering
finish
with
alcohol
well
hidden
this
beer
is
dangerously
drinkable
glad
to
say
we
have
two
more
bottles
of
this
aging
mouthfeel
is
mediumfull
bodied
with
a
sweetness
that
reminds
me
a
bit
of
the
sly
foxs
corked
and
caged
ichor
it
even
has
the
same
lack
of
co2
like
the
ichor
whats
the
deal
with
that
is
it
just
a
quad
problem
d
this
is
a
good
quad
it
reminds
me
most
of
the

a
little
hot
but
still
a
very
nice
beer
poured
into
a
chalice
a
nice
ruby
red
color
nice
carbonation
huge
twofinger
creamy
tan
head
lots
and
lots
of
nice
sticky
lacing
follows
the
nose
is
malty
yeasty
kinda
sweet
good
touch
of
figs
raisins
plums
and
some
caramel
the
taste
is
sweet
up
front
then
the
yeast
hit
next
with
malts
and
the
dark
fruits
the
alcohol
is
alittle
present
this
is
a
complex
brew
full
body
very
drinkable
highly
recommended
another
great
brew
from
southampton
mouthfeel
is
medium
to
full
bodied
with
a
high
level
of
carbonation
that
comes
of
as
little
biting
and
due
to
that
and
the
sweetness
the
drinkability
is
only
ok
for
me
pours
a
clear
dark
amber
color
with
mahogany
hues
and
a
gynormous
ice
cream
floatlike
light
tan
head
visibly
effervescent
leaving
impressive
lacing
patterns
in
its
wake
the
initial
uncorked
smell
came
across
a
little
sour
to
me
not
sure
what
that
was
about
but
that
soon
subsided
the
aroma
is
primarily
an
earthy
belgian
yeast
vanilla
and
dark
fruits
not
sure
but
i
imagine
that
vanilla
characteristic
is
part
of
the
10
5
abv
nicely
done
those
bountiful
tiny
bubbles
really
lend
a
creaminess
to
the
mouth
feel
full
flavored
and
bubbly
the
sweet
dark
fig
fruit
taste
is
complemented
by
a
tangy
almond
kick
this
one
is
coming
across
like
one
my
favorite
belgian
strong
dark
ales
instead
of
a
quad
im
having
a
really
hard
time
spanking
it
for
being
beyond
style
the
last
quad
that
i
had
was
in
your
face
alcohol
i
hope
that
when
i
get
to
westvleteren
12
that
it
presents
me
with
a
happy
medium
or
ill
really
be
bumbed
this
is
on
my
favorties
list
regardless
of
how
i
scored
it
not
what
i
remember
this
being
like
at
all
for
some
reason
this
one
is
very
sweet
yet
somehow
i
like
it
it
appears
to
lever
against
the
alcohol
bc
that
is
masked
to
an
extent
interested
to
see
what
will
happen
to
this
over
time
update
had
this
again
and
its
much
better
big
big
juicy
prun
and
raisins
with
complimenting
cocoa
and
caramel
like
an
authentic
quad
but
a
little
richer
i
certainly
would
like
to
try
this
in
a
few
years
again
drinkability
a
slow
sipping
belgianstyled
quad
here
a
bit
sweeter
than
expected
the
alcohol
and
sweetness
levels
knocks
down
the
mark
here
but
it
is
a
good
beer
drinkability
that
metallic
twang
detracts
somewhat
but
still
its
pretty
tasty
complex
and
a
decent
stab
that
personally
doesnt
quite
stand
up
to
form
not
a
letdown
it
gets
a
little
cloying
after
awhile
dark
fruit
aroma
very
sweet
with
some
rich
brown
sugar
and
lived
to
tell
about
it
not
picking
much
fruit
taste
to
it
i
have
mixed
feeling
with
this
spices
it
just
never
shows
up
anywhere
i
travel
to
in

yep
spices
this
is
a
top
tier
quad
period
it
drinks
like
something
this
strong
has
no
right
to
its
delicious
its
complex
and
satisfying
it
shows
that
the
brewer
knows
how
to
d
the
fundamentals
this
is
the

it
just
works
and
its

get
several
overall
not
a
bad
beer
but
with
my
buddy
and
i
coming
off
a
belgian
beer
fest
the
other
night
enjoying
the
likes
of
westvletern
yellow
cap
and
st
weekend
at
bernies
abt
12
this
definitely
is
not
in
the
same
league
but
it
was
enjoyable
nonetheless
while
not
a
world
class
quad
this
is
one
of
the
better
us
made
ones
there
is
plenty
of
flavor
and
it
is
true
to
the
style
only
thing
keeping
it
from
being
top
rated
is
it
could
use
a
bit
more
complexity
but
that
is
a
minor
point
well
worth
trying
if
you
want
to
see
how
well
a
us
brewery
can
make
a
quad
solid
quad
but
nothing
special
lots
of
dark
fruit
in
the
nose
would
have
been
better
if
less
sweet
right
up
there
with
the
best
belgians
in
the
world
albeit
a
bit
on
the
sweet
side
the
bruery
always
produces
extremely
expensive
brews
but
this
one
is
really
worth
it
had
this
on
tap
at
4th
ave
beer
bar
garden
in
brooklyn
ny
poured
into
a
goblet
black
as
night
with
a
small
head
herbaceous
sweet
aroma
the
first
taste
allows
you
to
consider
the
complexity
of
flavors
on
your
tongue
some
fruit
some
yeast
some
spice
some
malt
all
rolling
around
on
a
smooth
parade
of
tastiness
with
nary
a
hint
of
the
strong
abv
11
excelsior
o
possibly
bolstered
by
my
lukewarm
initial
enthusiasm
this
beer
knocked
my
socks
halfway
off
nothing
off
about
it
plenty
of
warm
semisweet
malt
with
some
intervaled
spice
flavors
solid
brew
hats
off
this
beer
has
some
nice
smooth
alcohol
character
and
the
malt
sweetness
is
there
aswell
it
just
doesnt
have
the
yeast
characters
i
would
like
to
taste
in
a
big
quad
i
cant
see
age
doing
much
for
this
beer
if
the
alcohol
mellows
it
will
be
just
to
much
sweetness
with
nothing
to
balance
it
a
great
beer
to
sit
and
enjoy
on
a
cold
night
great
overall
flavor
with
a
smooth
finish
easy
to
drink
too
much
yet
another
example
that
us
breweries
cant
touch
the
quality
of
quad
from
a
good
belgian
brewery
overly
sweet
with
little
dark
dried
fruit
character
uninteresting
yeast
o
this
is
really
good
stuff
not
exactly
up
there
with
the
best
true
belgian
quads
but
it
is
quite
good
supposed
to
be
a
sipper
i
just
started
a
fire
on
this
cold
winters
night
but
i
may
have
trouble
drinking
this
one
slowly
smoother
flavor
than
i
was
expecting
from
a
quad
creamy
finish
easy
to
drink
especially
since
it
has
such
a
high
abv
fantastic
representation
of
the

d
this
was
a
solid
quad
with
great
complex
scent
and
taste
it
had
a
great
body
too
although
it
was
pretty
hot
so
it
must
be
sipped
clearly
built
to
age
but
still
enjoyable
fresh
high
quality
brew
it
got
better
the
warmer
it
got
o
overall
this
beer
has
no
real
presence
of
hops
or
bitterness
but
yet
it
is
not
cloyingly
sweet
either
it
is
pretty
easy
to
drink
considering
the
strength
the
alcohol
is
well
hidden
but
it
is
definitely
a
sipping
beer
nice
complexity
in
the
flavors
of
the
fruits
candi
sugar
malts
and
belgian
yeast
a
nicely
balanced
and
gently
complex
beer
spicy
fruity
flavors
roll
about
with
a
twinge
of
boozy
heat
and
leave
a
mildly
charred
sugar
sweetness
and
very
subdued
bitter
aftertaste
lingering
on
the
palate
serving
type
bottle
fuller
bodied
a
little
thick
the
yeast
keeps
it
smooth
the
balance
between
sugary
sweetness
and
dark
fruits
like
figs
and
possible
raisins
is
there
and
the
hops
add
just
enough
to
give
it
a
crisp
finish
booze
pretty
well
hidden
and
this
is
a
great
sipper
you
can
have
anytime
not
just
holidays
this
is
a
very
sweet
but
very
nice
american
take
on
a
quad
far
more
balanced
and
approachable
than
most
other
attempts
the
yeast
clearly
plays
an
enormous
role
in
the
flavor
profile
here
had
this
draft
and
while
drinkable
was
overly
pedestrian
there
is
little
doubt
in
my
mind
that
this
is
one
of
if
not
the
single
best
straight
up
quad
i
have
ever
had
made
in
america
the
other
beers
in
this
series
were
starting
to
get
out
there
a
bit
pineapple
juice
gooseberriers
and
so
on
so
its
nice
to
get
grounded
a
little
here
dark
rum
colored
brew
with
red
and
brown
in
the
light
and
a
tall
frothy
head
indicative
of
the
style
it
smells
like
tons
of
dried
fruit
raisins
and
cherries
and
dates
i
get
the
candy
sugar
too
molasses
and
booze
and
the
belgian
yeast
is
fruity
but
not
over
the
top
in
its
ester
intensity
the
flavor
is
just
like
the
nose
with
all
the
fruits
coming
through
its
a
touch
tannic
like
a
diluted
red
wine
but
its
flattering
to
the
overall
the
booze
does
show
up
in
the
finish
especially
as
it
warms
but
i
still
wouldnt
have
placed
it
over
10
abv
there
is
a
nice
richness
and
creaminess
of
feel
that
makes
it
a
great
holiday
beer
but
im
not
sure
i
would
age
this
one
i
cant
imagine
any
part
of
the
experience
improving
over
time
world
class
quad
interesting
and
hearty
memorable
for
me
best
quad
ive
ever
had
i
think
following
it
up
with
westy
12
and
rochefort
10
a
bit
hot
but
really
nice
plum
raisin
and
caramelflavors
needs
about
two
years
probably
o
not
a
bad
quad
just
not
a
stellar
quad
just
ok
not
getting
a
whole
lot
of
good
out
of
this
very
little
smell
or
flavor
forme
on
this
one
i
had
some
bigger
hopes
for
it
poured

dominated
by

progresses
from

to

notes
before
leaving
a
lingering
brown
sugar
and
dark
fruit
aftertaste
with
a
hint
of
tartness
medium
bodied
a
very
nicely
made
flavorful
belgian
although
i
found
the
profile
to
be
closer
to
a
belgian
dark
strong
ale
than
a
classic
quadrupel
although
the
clove
and
belgian
spices
are
faint
or
absent
no
matter
there
is
a
lot
to
taste
here
rich
and
satisfying
abv
is
covered
well
this
may
be
one
of
my
favorites
from
the
series
a
great
choice
for
christmas
o
the
bruerys
7
swansaswimming
is
a
beautiful
addition
to
their
12
days
of
christmas
series
and
is
one
of
the
most
welldone
americanbrewed
belgian
quads
right
on
for
style
something
they
rarely
seem
to
shoot
for
malty
complex
and
loaded
with
classic
belgian
yeast
characteristics
this
big
beer
will
surely
hang
on
for
the
remainder
of
the
series
developing
over
time
will
check
it
out
again
after
it
sits
for
a
couple
of
years
wonderful
layers
and
complexity
solid
quad
this
is
a
slightly
unorthodox
quad
but
its
tasty
and
enjoyable
carbonation
was
light
and
the
alcohol
comes
through
slightly
but
nicely
better
than

taste
is
slick
and
oily
initially
and
when
cold
but
gathers
some
traction
with
warming
and
exposure
yeilding
more
belgian
yeast
character
and
some
more
subtle
complexities
feel
is
expected
given
the
nose
and
taste
that
being
a
bit
sweet
and
viscous
with
moderate
complexity
overall
a
bit
one
sided
and
somewhat
limited
in
nature
though
will
likely
improve
with
a
couple
years
of
quiet
time
personally
prefer
quads
a
bit
drier
but
this
doesnt
disappoint
either
overall
was
super
impressed
by
this
beer
and
for
the
price
i
was
really
blown
away
a
solid
raisin
and
banana
forward
quad
the
taste
has
a
lovely
malt
and
yeast
cohesion
with
mild
dark
sugar
flavor
and
slight
raisin
with
a
dried
fruit
character
from
the
yeast
that
also
has
a
figlike
tropical
aspect
with
almost
floral
taste
and
light
nutty
malt
quality
with
slight
woody
and
mildly
herbal
accent
with
some
alcohol
warmth
in
the
back
with
hints
of
molasses
this
is
an
excellent
strong
dark
belgian
alevery
smooth
for
the
strength
with
excellent
malt
flavor
and
such
sweetness
without
becoming
cloying
i
love
a
strong
ale
like
this
with
such
rich
taste
and
complexity
very
nice
layers
with
this
beer
you
get
a
great
sweetness
along
with
a
nice
nutty
fruit
cake
taste
roasted
pecans
for
sure
but
very
faint
apricot
overall
decent
not
amazing
dont
think
im
buying
this
again
for
a
bruery
product
im
very
underwhelmed
tmo
quite
good
dark
fruit
plums
and
grapes
marinated
in
a
big
boozy
sweetness
far
sweeter
than
the
nose
suggested
but
still
very
drinkable
due
to
a
really
nice
nutty
almost
brown
ale
vibe
definitely
a
bit
hot
but
probably
the
best
one
in
the
series
aside
from
2td
taking
down
this
whole
bottle
shouldnt
be
a
problem
a
bit
fizzy
in
the
feel
and
definitely
lacking
the
creaminess
i
usually
look
for
in
the
classic
quad
but
all
in
all
a
worthwhile
beer
to
check
out
solid
on
the
initial
pour
but
little
to
no
residual
head
or
lacing
nose
is
fruity
and
sweet
tastes
like
it
smells
malty
with
some
strong
and
some
subtle
fruit
components
most
notably
raisin
thick
and
syrupy
quads
are
not
my
favorite
style
no
belgians
in
general
but
overall
this
is
a
really
good
quaff
especially
for
the
style
serving
type
on
tap
doesnt
have
the
yeasty
kick
that
i
like
it
most
quads
still
has
a
decent
flavor
but
tastes
a
bit
watery
for
lack
of
a
better
term
overall
a
very
solid
quad
fruity
notes
on
the
nose
and
very
smooth
finish
this
should
age

nicely

glass
refreshing
yet
invigorating
triple
dont
let
this
one
get
the
best
of
you
its
subtle
but
strong
sweet
start
and
finish
will
hide
the
fact
that
this
is
a
11
beer
that
will
sneak
up
on
you
ridiculously
delicious
belgian
quad
brimming
with
flavors
of
raisins
figs
dates
and
cocoa
ill
be
buying
a
case
of
this
for
sure
overall
think
of
this
less
as
a
belgian
quad
and
more
of
an
americanstyle
quad
reinforced
by
the
addition
of
raisins
in
that
sense
it
holds
its
own
while
it
may
not
be
at
the
top
of
the
list
for
american
quads
i
have
to
imagine
its
somewhere
in
the
top
five
its
clear
that
lost
and
found
is
this
beers
antecedent
absolutely
excellent
tastes
of
apple

of

excellent
belgian
taste
with
no

of

you
could
guess
the
abv
was

not
10
absolutely
excellent
quad
and
well
done
across

board
flavor
is

that

on
for

a
highly
enjoyable
offering
a
damn
good
beer
aside
from
the
heavy
booze
presence
i
loved
it
in
every
other
regard
maybe
id
suggest
2
or
more
years
of
aging
to
address
the
astringency
bit
sweet
bit
heavy
something
to
cut
through
more
bitterness
namely
would
be
welcome
overall
yeah
another
fine
brew
out
of
the
lost
abbey
stable
its
certainly
not
different
enough
to
stand
out
from
the
crowd
but
its
a
beer
im
perfectly
happy
to
drink
but
then
pretty
much
anything
with
the
la
label
on
it
is
something
im
perfectly
happy
to
drink
good
quad
and
certainly
the
raisins
were
a
forefront
character
in
this
didnt
quite
hit
the
mark
on
balance
as
i
felt
the
alcohol
was
a
bit
too
perceptible
once
it
warmed
still
quite
tasty
and
drinkable
but
i
wouldnt
put
it
in
top
marks
it
falls
short
of
the
complexity
and
balance
i
would
expect
in
the
best
belgian
quads
still
a
quite
respectable
beer
and
rather
unique
in
its
own
regard
o
good
but
abv
is
too
high
and
complexity
is
too
low
overall
very
good
sipping
beer
complex
flavor
and
wellsuited
mouthfeel
pours
dark
brown
with
a
nice
beige
head
that
diminishes
with
slight
lacing
i
read
the
other
reviews
and
mine
is
a
bit
different
drinking
from
a
tulip
glass
frog
and
onion
pub
bermuda
filled
from
a
corked
1
pint
9
4
fluid
ounce
bottle
the
predominant
taste
that
comes
to
the
front
is
molasses
with
raisins
and
a
warming
alcohol
feel
the
bottle
should
be
shared
as
the
apvis
listed
at
10
5
apv
my
best
description
of
this
taste
is
toasted
molasses
a
very
nice
winter
brew
satisfying
that
need
for
a
filling
satisfying
brew
certainly
one
worth
tasting
savoring
enjoying
the
taste
is
smooth
to
the
tongue
and
warming
a
beer
worth
trying
ooverall
a
great
quad
by
lost
abbey
more
please
o
the
lost
abbeys
judgement
day
quad
is
a
rich
and
robust
beer
thats
filled
with
belgian
yeast
complexity
but
at
the
end
of
the
day
its
clearly
an
americanbrewed
dark
belgianstyle
beer
the
addition
of
raisins
is
a
nice
touch
though
they
seem
to
practice
this
with
some
frequency
but
it
seems
to
me
achieving
the
aroma
and
flavor
of
raisins
in
a
beer
like
this
is
a
job
for
the
yeast
not
the
grape
grower
and
while
my
biggest
dissatisfaction
if
you
would
call
it
that
is
the
overuse
of
heavily
roasted
malt
i
think
judgement
day
is
a
damn
fine
beer
just
unique
in
its
own
right
d
a
good
big
belgian
dark
beer
but
not
loving
this
a
couple
off
things
like
the
metallic
notes
i
am
picking
up
on
my
first
try
with
lost
abbey
more
a
fan
of
their
port
brew
offerings
didnt
do
much
for
me
spend
the
extra
four
bucks
and
get
a
st
bernardus
abt
12
overall
par
for
the
course
as
far
as
quads
go
thats
a
good
thing
its
not
blowing
me
away
but
it
is
a
solid
effort
wouldnt
actively
seek
this
out
but
would
get
again
d
a
nice
sipper
of
a
quad
from
lost
abbey
although
lacks
a
bit
of
depth
to
me
would
have
again
but
i
actually
enjoyed
the
10
commandments
a
bit
more
to
this
one
o
one
of
my
favorites
from
lost
abbey
its
definitely
worth
a
try
and
comes
in
a
nice
big
bottle
with
one
of
their
amazingly
epic
labels
the
beer
pours
a
deep
mahogany
with
maroon
highlights
with
a
rocky
light
tan
head
of
sudsy
bubbles
the
head
sits
about
a
fingers
width
above
the
glass
with
nice
lasting
power
in
body
the
beer
is
deep
and
dark
nearly
opaque
but
seems
to
be
clear
of
particles
on
the
nose
the
beer
of
rich
raisins
tart
plums
and
soft
brown
sugar
and
caramel
malt
touches
of
spicy
clove
and
even
a
hint
of
banana
esters
touch
upon
the
nose
there
is
even
a
touch
of
smooth
breadiness
and
warming
alcohol
waft
over
the
nostrils
on
the
tongue
the
beer
tastes
boozy
sweet
with
lots
of
fruity
esters
the
alcohol
is
very
aggressive
at
the
start
of
the
sip
but
does
mellow
into
the
rest
of
the
beer
as
the
sip
continues
soft
acidity
play
off
the
esters
of
the
beer
in
the
middle
of
the
sip
but
only
a
touch
of
bitter
hops
do
touch
the
tongue
in
flavor
the
beer
begins
as
hot
stale
spicy
alcohol
that
mellows
into
sweet
raisins
phenolic
clove
bananas
and
unripe
plums
with
a
touch
of
tartness
the
finish
brings
forward
bitter
herbs
with
soft
astringency
and
a
touch
more
hot
booze
caramel
and
more
raisins
the
aftertaste
is
soft
bread
and
raisins
in
brown
sugar
stale
green
apple
flavors
hit
the
mouth
throughout
sip
and
what
feels
like
herbal
tannins
also
make
an
appearance
occasionally
in
the
sip
in
the
mouth
the
beer
feels
medium
to
full
bodied
carbonation
is
of
middling
strength
but
the
mouthfeel
is
velvety
smooth
with
a
little
harshness
from
the
alcohol
overall
this
is
a
nice
quadbelgian
strong
ale
that
could
use
a
little
more
time
in
the
cellar
the
alcoholic
heat
is
a
bit
much
and
takes
away
from
the
rest
of
the
beer
flavors
are
rich
and
the
raisin
is
very
dominant
in
the
taste
but
i
want
more
of
the
phenols
and
esters
from
the
yeast
the
nose
is
also
a
bit
weak
in
terms
of
the
flavoring
of
the
rest
of
the
beer
this
is
a
good
beer
that
should
be
cellared
for
optimum
flavoring
overall
a
very
good
quad
not
in
the
same
class
as
some
of
the
belgian
heavyweights
but
quite
respectable
o
a
solid
quad
very
good
for
the
price
very
dark
brown
with
khaki
colored
creamy
head
which
fades
to
thin
covering
rich
smells
aroma
of
pipe
tobacco
leather
dark
fruit
spicy
a
bit
of
alcohol
tastes
of
complex
malt
flavors
i
do
pick
up
a
bit
of
raisin
boozy
herbal
finish
medium
body
but
coats
the
tongue
lower
soft
carbonation
overall
perhaps
the
best
nonbelgian
brewed
quad
ive
had
from
my
tasting
notes
i
could
tell
it
was
a
big
beer
from
the
moment
i
popped
the
cork
there
were
strong
belgian
aromas
as
i
poured
this
dark
brown
cloudy
beer
that
had
lots
of
gorgeous
settlement
this
was
a
thick
brew
with
very
strong
raisin
caramel
and
burnt
sugar
flavors
with
a
slight
bitter
alcohol
finish
this
is
a
great
american
interpretation
of
a
belgian
style
and
its
obvious
the
lost
abbey
knows
what
they
are
doing
its
a
shame
i
only
brought
back
one
sample
of
their
lineup
and
that
you
cannot
get
their
great
beers
in
texas
overall
judgement
day
is
not
quite
your
typical
quad
but
is
still
a
fantastic
beer
and
one
id
love
to
have
again
poured
into
a
pint
glass
overall
this
beer
is
really
very
good
one
of
the
best
of
the
style
from
an
american
brewery
in
my
opinion
a
mellow
and
nicely
made
mouthful
of
dark
fruity
flavors
reminds
me
of
a
rich
dark
port
wine
the
mouthfeel
is
lightmedium
bodied
it
seems
a
little
over
carbonated
leaves
a
little
coating
on
the
tongue
there
is
not
much
i
really
like
about
this
beer
things
are
slightly
more
bitter
than
i
have
found
in
most
belgian
quads
part
of
that
is
due
to
the
relative
abdication
of
the
sweeter
elements
of
the
beer
that
were
in
the
nose
and
part
is
due
to
the
rather
uncompromising
nature
of
the
booziness
while
i
am
glad
to
have
tried
it
i
would
rather
have
had
this
in
a
12oz
bottle
than
the
gargantuan
bottle
i
have
in
front
of
me
as
it
would
simply
be
a
more
reasonable
amount
a
pretty
decent
quad
i
have
to
admit
that
it
was
lighter
than
other
quads
that
ive
had
mouthfeel
is
dry
and
surprisingly
light
overall
this
is
a
pretty
good
beer
o
feels
like
this
lacks
complexity
for
a
style
im
quite
fond
of
the
belgianbrewed
ones
are
just
plain
better
than
our
american
interpretations
overall
i
would
have
hoped
2
years
would
have
helped
to
tone
down
the
higher
abv
and
mesh
the
flavor
profile
as
with
most
strong
belgian
ales
but
this
was
not
the
case
just
too
boozy
and
unbalanced
the
kind
of
beer
i
would
have
loved
in
my
craft
beer
infancy
but
a
more
developed
palate
merely
passes
this
off
as
hot
and
way
too
raisin
forward
the
texture
is
crisper
with
moderate
carbonation
flavor
profile
is
an
interesting
fusion
of
belgian
strong
dark
ale
and
stout
chocolatey
notes
from
roasted
malts
meet
ripe
raisin
and
plum
and
a
balancing
hop
bitterness
carbonation
is
aggressive
but
fine
nicely
done
alcohol
is
very
well
masked
interesting
hybrid
sort
of
beer
a
quad
thats
not
all
that
quadlike
i
enjoyed
this
100
on
its
own
but
imagine
paired
with
the
right
meal
this
would
escalate
to
a
whole
new
level
i
cellared
this
bottle
for
about
a
year
and
a
half
the
quad
was
poured
into
a
snifter
with
an
appearance
that
was
black
with
some
degree
of
cloudiness
the
aroma
was
that
of
malt
and
dark
fruit
in
the
initial
taste
one
gets
a
high
level
of
dark
fruit
such
as
raisin
prunes
and
dates
even
before
identifying
the
initial
taste
one
notices
the
warmth
on
this
one
dark
fruit
are
heavily
involved
burnt
malt
molasses
and
dark
chocolate
notes
are
also
present
the
malts
become
more
noticeable
in
the
aftertaste
the
warming
sensation
continues
throughout
each
seem
though
this
is
a
yearround
brew
quads
are
great
on
a
cold
winter
night
pours
a
translucent
prune
brown
with
glints
of
cola
color
around
the
edges
of
the
glass
the
head
is
huge
foamy
and
dark
tan
a
bouquet
of
tart
grape
raisin
cherry
coke
and
notes
of
chocolate
mouthfeel
is
full
nearly
thick
wet
with
a
bit
of
carbonation
burn
that
interacts
with
the
spiciness
some
vanilla
more
raisin
and
brown
sugar
and
chocolate
flavors
sweet
and
tart
occurring
simultaneously
not
an
offputting
amount
of
spiciness
for
which
i
am
grateful
a
bit
just
the
slightest
boozy
at
the
finish
a
pretty
clever
beer
the
beer
is
chestnut
brown
with
a
thin
beige
collar
the
aroma
offers
sweet
malt
raisins
prunes
yeast
caramels
toffee
the
flavor
is
sweet
with
an
abundance
of
toffee
caramel
candies
with
a
touch
of
belgian
yeast
medium
bodied
with
adequate
carbonation
perhaps
a
bit
out
of
balance
with
an
over
abundance
of
sweetness
and
toffee
a
tasty
beer
in
small
quantities
o
i
really
enjoyed
this
quad
classic
and
well
done
for
a
non
trappist
quad
overall
a
sweet
powerful
quad
that
lacks
the
finesse
of
the
better
ones
an
interesting
effort
but
one
i
probably
wont
revisit
o
would
not
have
guessed
raisins
were
used
even
though
all
the
tart
juicy
fruity
tastes
are
there
what
i
expect
from
a
quad
with
tons
of
complex
caramel
malt
flavor
and
little
booze
taste
for
strength
o
this
beer
was
quite
delicious
i
would
definitely
buy
this
again
o
good
drinkability
my
fist
american
made
quad
my
second
lost
abbey
after
the
angels
share
not
as
good
as
the
first
one
but
still
a
good
beer
recommended
o
well
its
pretty
good
but
nothing
id
go
back
to
im
not
sure
if
the
alcohol
would
fade
with
some
more
age
but
this
bottle
already
had
several
months
on
it
a
big
quad
to
be
sure
glad
i
got
to
try
it
once
but
i
doubt
there
will
be
a
repeat
performance
really
nice
quad
nice
balance
with
out
being
overboozy
very
drinkable
o
i
really
enjoyed
this
beer
and
for
around
10
i
hope
to
buy
another
one
if
given
the
chance
a
good
quad
for
sure
this
one
was
aged
around
a
year
and
was
smooth
i
could
see
where
a
fresh
one
may
have
a
more
boozy
taste
to
it
o
this
is
a
solid
quadruple
however
it
finishes
a
little
too
dry
for
my
taste
i
prefer
quads
that
leave
your
tongue
moist
with
those
fruit
flavors
lingering
but
thats
just
me
the
alcohol
is
there
but
it
doesnt
feel
like
a
10
5
there
is
a
good
sweetness
that
keeps
it
masked
until
the
end
i
wanted
to
give
this
beer
a
shot
before
i
try
the
cuvee
de
tomme
seeing
as
this
is
the
base
beer
for
that
recipe
if
you
can
get
this
bottle
for
ten
and
under
its
definitely
worth
a
try
seeing
as
some
have
payed
up
to
twenty
and
over
for
the
750ml
i
would
advise
against
that
this
shouldnt
be
over
ten
dollars
overall
i
preferred
the
weyerbacher
blasphemy
to
the
lost
abbey
judgment
day
but
this
doesnt
mean
judgment
day
was
bad
in
the
least
while
neither
can
really
compete
with
true
belgian
quads
both
breweries
did
a
pretty
damn
good
job
of
not
destroying
the
style
in
fact
id
have
to
say
they
both
made
progress
of
being
truer
to
style
than
most
while
i
do
chose
weyerbacher
blasphemy
as
the
victor
it
has
had
the
advantage
of
having
a
bit
of
aging
on
it
at
the
brewery
letting
the
beer
mellow
out
and
become
a
bit
more
complex
if
i
recall
while
weyerbacher
quad
was
very
good
it
was
a
little
sloppier
than
its
barrel
aged
counter
part
good
show
by
both
breweries
though
i
enjoyed
them
both
750
ml
caged
and
corked
bottle
i
know
ive
had
this
bottle
for
a
little
while
id
guess
its
about
a
year
old
served
in
a
dfh
signature
glass
the
beer
pours
a
reddishbrown
color
with
about
an
inch
frothy
tan
head
that
stays
around
for
a
very
long
time
theres
also
a
good
amount
of
lacing
aroma
is
nice
it
smells
like
dark
fruit
raisins
plums
peppery
spice
molasses
and
some
bready
malt
it
tastes
like
dark
fruit
raisins
cherries
plums
molasses
caramel
bready
malt
and
some
chocolate
mouthfeelbody
is
medium
its
a
bit
creamy
and
is
well
carbonated
i
think
this
is
a
good
overall
brew
id
buy
this
one
again
at
10
99
a
bottle
this
beer
poured
from
a
750
ml
corked
bottle
is
a
burgundy
color
with
a
rich
tan
head
the
head
dissipates
after
a
few
minutes
but
the
beer
retains
a
continuous
stream
of
small
carbonation
bubbles
the
aroma
is
of
intense
malt
mildly
roasted
with
lots
of
bubblegum
spice
and
sugar
belgian
sweet
grape
skins
hints
of
apple
skins
and
cinnamon
full
in
body
this
is
a
fine
beer
o
i
wish
this
wasnt
so
expensive
and
that
lost
abbey
wasnt
so
pretentious
about
this
one
it
was
good
but
not
worth
the
20
price
tag
especially
considering
the
many
belgian
quads
on
the
immediate
market
in
my
area
that
are
far
superior
overall
i
like
this
offering
a
lot
will
probably
drink
this
again
overall
a
nice
quad
this
batch
has
more
chocolate
and
roast
than
usual
o
fun
beer
and
my
first
try
at
lost
abbey
while
a
nice
quad
it
is
far
from
the
very
good
ones
that
you
can
get
much
easier
overall
this
was
sweet
tasty
beer
that
warms
the
body
and
tingles
the
tastebuds
very
nice
overall
i
get
what
they
are
going
for
here
and
it
is
a
nice
beer
and
a
sipper
for
sure
at
10
5
abv
this
to
me
is
a
nice
beer
to
have
after
a
good
meal
or
by
the
fireplace
in
the
cooler
months
in
may
this
one
was
a
predinner
crusher
that
left
me
looking
for
the
bread
sticks
good
variety
of
flavors
but
i
once
again
realize
that
the
belgians
just
do
this
so
much
better
at
the
price
cheers
o
overall
a
flavor
that
showed
some
complexity
a
manageable
alcohol
per
bomber
were
its
good
points
a
lack
luster
nose
and
mouthful
were
its
weak
points
drinks
like
a
strong
ale
rather
quad
but
a
decent
flavor
despite
the
least
for
those
who
just
want
to
have
a
good
beer
and
not
judge
flavor
is
rich
and
malty
with
molasses
and
brown
sugar
dominant
also
get
some
raisin
and
plums
and
red
grape
the
booze
is
well
hidden
and
sneaks
up
on
me
during
the
review
this
is
actually
an
easy
drinking
beer
despite
the
booziness
and
high
octane
dangerously
easy
to
drink
but
very
appealing
flavor
and
welll
crafted
brew
wish
i
had
another
bottle
doa
o
originally
i
was
trepidatious
about
fruit
in
my
beer
however
the
raisin
seemed
to
add
a
dark
sweetness
that
complimented
the
style
really
enjoyable
overall
overall
i
would
put
this
one
on
the
low
end
of
the
lost
abbey
pool
of
beers
i
would
pick
from
but
that
means
i
would
still
pick
it
over
70
of
beers
out
there
good
value
for
the
and
worth
taking
a
taste
of
if
you
get
the
chance
i
think
it
is
one
of
those
beers
in
the
la
evolution
that
led
to
bigger
badder
beers
fuller
body
well
carbonated
sticky
and
full
on
the
tongue
this
is
a
pretty
nice
quad
i
thought
the
alcohol
might
be
a
little
overwhelming
but
it
was
actually
pretty
balanced
after
a
little
time
resting
in
the
bottle
poured
from
the
bottle
into
a
chalice
it
develops
a
nice
dark
tan
head
the
appearance
is
dark
mahogany
brown
scent
is
all
dark
fruit
and
yeasty
bread
the
taste
while
good
is
very
sweet
to
my
palate
and
is
a
bit
off
putting
not
quite
as
much
carbonation
as
would
be
expected
for
a
brew
this
sweet
i
was
hoping
that
this
would
be
a
good
sub
for
some
of
the
belgian
quads
that
i
love
since
its
price
is
better
but
its
not
quiet
up
to
par
for
that
purpose
for
me
not
a
bad
brew
at
all
just
a
bit
disappointing
too
sweet
for
my
liking
maybe
my
expectations
were
too
high
o
this
beer
could
use
a
fuller
body
more
fruit
flavors
and
some
sweetness
the
taste
seems
to
improve
a
bit
as
it
begins
to
warm
up
o
tastes
more
like
a
belgian
strong
dark
ale
than
a
quad
not
as
much
sweetness
as
i
would
have
expected
not
sure
i
really
want
another
of
these
drinkabilityoverall
this
beer
was
a
bit
sweet
to
really
drink
a
ton
of
but
that
being
said
did
enjoy
the
flavor
profile
was
pretty
decent
first
try
from
the
much
known
lost
abbey
brand
not
sure
something
would
rush
for
again
but
if
in
mood
for
good
quad
worth
shot
the
brightest
point
for
this
beer
was
the
nose
really
good
overall
a
nice
treat
but
not
something
that
would
be
a
regular
in
my
fridge
perhaps
once
or
twice
a
year
kind
of
like
a
rochefort
10
good
weight
and
plenty
of
sweetness
would
make
this
a
great
dessert
beer
but
i
dont
think
id
want
to
drink
it
while
eating
due
to
the
weight
overall
4
5
if
this
is
judgment
day
my
ruling
is
well
done
my
good
and
faithful
servant
amazing
beer
that
the
label
calls
a
belgian
dark
quad
ale
call
it
whatever
you
want
8
99
for
750
ml
thats
25
36
u
s
ounces
is
a
bargain
if
you
are
lucky
enough
to
find
it
buy
it
speaking
of
sipping
judgment
day
is
not
a
beer
you
want
to
drink
fast
at
10
5
abv
and
the
insane
amounts
of
malt
and
fruit
flavor
this
beer
is
a
monster
this
would
be
an
excellent
beer
to
cellar
for
a
while
as
the
bold
malt
and
high
abv
will
lend
to
a
smoother
more
rumlike
product
over
time
if
i
had
more
self
control
i
would
age
this
one
but
i
know
it
wouldnt
last
more
than
a
month
sure
would
be
nice
to
see
what
some
time
will
do
to
this
beast
though
b
maybe
a
b
preyeast
pour
first
beer
tried
by
lost
abbey
which
is
new
to
nj
the
bottles
all
look
cool
anyway
dude
at
the
beer
store
suggested
that
i
try
this
one
pours
very
dark
with
a
thick
head
into
my
tulip
glass
head
disappears
quickly
lots
of
lacing
on
the
side
smells
of
booze
vanilla
and
raisins
tastes
of
grape
raisins
and
booze
very
hot
going
down
not
necessarily
a
bad
thing
mouthfeel
somewhat
thick
i
have
to
say
ive
had
several
better
quads
but
this
is
still
very
good
its
getting
better
as
i
drink
more
of
it
i
bought
the
big
stout
of
theirs
cant
wait
to
try
that
one
overall
4
i
feel
like
it
should
have
way
less
carbonation
personally
the
booze
is
very
assaulting
which
i
dont
mind
but
could
definitely
be
a
turnoff
to
some
with
a
year
or
more
of
aging
this
beer
would
be
10x
better
definitely
enjoyed
but
would
not
spend
12
on
it
again
overall
nice
slow
sipping
beer
full
of
flavor
this
one
is
great

a
cold
night

this
is
a
very
good
quad
that
builds
layer
upon
layer
of
a
sweetness
echo
chamber
if
youre
allergic
to
sugar
or
vaguely
diabetic
dont
even
sniff
this
brew
o
pretty
good
i
liked
it
as
a
beer
that
i
was
trying
for
the
first
time
but
i
dont
know
if
ive
ever
go
out
and
seek
this
brew
out
mouthfeel
is
pretty
light
for
a
quad
its
crisp
but
falls
flat
at
the
end
overall
this
beer
had
some
great
qualities
but
unfortunately
the
salty
soy
sauce
flavor
was
the
lasting
trademark
of
this
beer
overall
a
pretty
good
quad
the
raisins
are
definitely
prevalent
drinkability
is
pretty
high
the
abv
is
well
hidden
judgment
day
is
a
pretty
good
quad
but
does
have
its
shortcomings
the
biggest
issues
are
the
light
belgian
yeast
presence
and
the
bodymouthfeel
if
those
two
issues
were
addressed
itd
likely
be
improved
those
arent
huge
problems
though
its
definitely
good
and
is
worth
your
attention
edit
i
want
to
rereview
this
beer
because
it
might
of
been
stored
improperly

this

put

beer
an
extremely
well
balanced
big

with
a
good
amount
of
carbonation
preventing
it
from
feeling
overly
heavy
some
warmth
from

but
nothing
overwhelming
well
done
this
is
definitely
one
to
drink
slowly
and
enjoy
on
a
cold
winter
evening
overall
an
ok
quadrupel
that
has
flavor
and
is
fairly
drinkable
hiding
the
abv
very
well
another
good
beer
from
the
lost
abbey

a
dark
brown
with
some
lighter
browns
around
the
edges
huge
tan
head
of
several
fingers
great
lacing
and

nose
has
loads
of
dark
fruit
notes
some
berries
rich
chocolate
notes
and
some

notes
too

this
only
adds
to
the
complexity
of

caramelly

lots

there
too
hints

vanilla

light

peppery
carbonation
initially
and
melts
over
the

with
a
creamy
and
smooth

subtle
alcohol
in
the
finish
an
excellent
quad
my
second
favourite
on
the
day
really
some
fantastic
flavours
and
aroma
overall
this
is
not
close
to
the
best
belgian
quad
ive
had
but
it
is
still
worthy
of
your
purchase
great
beer
but
the
sweetness
needs
to
be
toned
down
o
good
beer
for
the
price
id
like
to
age
a
bottle
to
see
if
it
might
cut
out
some
of
the
stronger
alcohol
finish
this
beer
had
a
great
complex
start
but
its
finish
was
a
little
dry
for
me
definitely
worth
a
try
for
the
price
a
complex
and
nice
brew
sweet
and
potent
o
im
a
bit
fan
of
quads
and
this
one
doesnt
disappoint
grab
it
if
you
can
and
i
guess
let
it
sit
for
a
year
or
so
cause
im
really
diggin
the
flavors
o
great
overall
beer
i
would
recommend
to
a
friend
pours
a
dark
dark
brown
color
thin
head
gone
before
my
first
sip
smell
is
heavy
on
alcohol
and
fruit
taste
has
a
very
alcohol
heavy
start
with
a
fruity
sweet
back
not
bad
so
far
not
great
maybe
the
flavor
will
improve
with
a
little
warmth
as
i
generally
do
keep
my
fridge
kinda
cold
initial
mouthfeel
definitely
has
an
alcohol
burn
but
nothing
unbearable
again
sometimes
that
goes
away
with
a
lil
warmth
pretty
good
beer
that
indeed
does
improve
as
it
breathes
a
little
bit
feels
full
in
body
with
mild
carbonation
kind
of
dry
in
the
end
along
with
a
slow
alcohol
burn
overall
this
beer
is
quite
aggressive
it
should
age
really
well
for
35
years
this
beer
could
easily
be
an
a
only
time
will
tell
if
this
could
be
considered
an
a
beer
though
this
was
really
good
fun
to
try
an
american
perspective
on
the
quad
the
mouthfeel
wasnt
as
big
as
a
rochefort
or
westy
so
it
loses
some
points
but
good
effort
also
i
prefer
slightly
more
brown
sugar
tastes
in
my
quads
a
fair
amount
of
carbonation
but
it
is
real
smooth
solid
medium
bodied
not
quite
sticky
it
is
a
sipper
i
suggest
sharing
this
one
though
i
didnt
d
very
nice
and
surprisingly
drinkable
really
like
this
alot
would
drink
again
o
this
is
a
really
tasty
quadrupel
im
glad
i
picked
this
one
up
at
binnys
tomme
arthur
makes
more
than
a
few
beers
that
have
the
kind
of
character
and
temperament
to
intimidate
but
judgement
day
despite
its
threatening
name
and
10
5
alcohol
is
a
beer
that
administers
warm
hugs
rather
than
stiff
blows
its
a
best
friend
in
a
750ml
serving
size
and
its
every
bit
the
beer
that
youd
get
from
any
trappist
brewery
o
nice
drink
would
definitely
buy
again
o
a
pretty
decent
beer
the
alcohol
comes
off
a
bit
strong
and
some
time
in
the
cellar
would
be
good
head
retention
needs
some
serious
work
would
recommend
though
especially
since
all
quads
are
glorious
this
just
is
a
good
to
average
one
o
interesting
beer
with
the
raisin
and
dark
fruit
flavors
taking
center
stage
looking
forward
to
trying
some
more
lost
abbey
beers
very
solid
quad
a
great
diversity
of
flavors
with
a
big
and
powerful
delivery
a
tad
on
the
sweet
side
to
get
nitpicky
especially
on
the
finish
but
i
bet
this
would
cellar
beautifully
the
raisins
were
a
nice
touch
too
although
i
prefer
in
a
quad
the
addition
of
a
brighter
and
uplifting
cherry
character
like
the
3
philosophers
or
boulevard
bbq
the
raisins
rich
elegance
also
took
this
beer
in
a
very
sexy
direction
oi
know
lost
abbey
takes
some
hits
from
time
to
time
with
the
quality
control
of
their
beers
or
if
they
are
tainted
in
someway
but
i
thought
this
one
was
pretty
good
even
if
there
were
some
slight
signs
of
a
mold
or
something
along
the
surface
between
glass
cork
slight
definitely
a
different
experience
from
the
belgian
quadruples
that
i
love
a
refreshing
difference
in
mouthfeel
and
somewhat
in
the
flavor
profile
this
one
is
not
dominated
by
dark
fruits
but
rather
they
are
balanced
by
the
coffee
o
a
good
beer
to
be
sure
but
falls
a
little
short
of
expectations
flavor
is
good
but
never
quite
gets
to
great
still
absolutely
worth
a
try
just
might
tickle
your
tastebuds
more
than
it
did
mine
even
though
you
cant
taste
the
alcohol
by
the
time
you
reach
the
end
of
the
glass
it
does
help
to
erase
any
shortcomings
o
overall
pretty
good
for
an
american
quad
glad
i
tried
it
but
nothing
special
overall
a
solid
quadrupel
but
clearly
not
up
there
with
the
best
a
very
good
californian
version
though
poured
a
big
thick
head
immediately
the
nose
had
a
very
distinct
pineapple
juice
smell
my
first
impression
was
that
it
tastes
like
new
belgiums
1554

crack
chocolate
malt
is
definitely
the
dominant
flavor
i
was
expecting
something
a
little
more
balanced
high
alcohol
is
apparent
and
warm
this
heavy
beer
is
good
but
not
my
fave
from
lost
abbey
overall
very
pleasant
to
drink
with
no
hint
of
the
10
abv
i
love
this
beer
and
its
one
of
the
few
quads
i
could
drink
regularly
pours
a
nice
dark
mahogany
with
a
fairly
thick
light
tan
head
aroma
is
malty
and
slighty
sweet
with
a
decided
raisin
undertone
and
a
hint
of
yeast
malty
and
slightly
syrupy
flavor
has
tones
of
fruit
and
raisin
with
a
hint
of
caramel
and
a
bit
of
an
alcohol
nip
silky
smooth
texture
has
a
subtle
tingle
and
leaves
a
slightly
rough
and
fizzy
finish
got
this
one
while
out
in
cali
for
the
bruery
reserve
society
party
big
thanks
to
womencantsail
for
shipping
this
one
to
me
after
i
left
shared
this
one
with
the
columbia
homebrew
club
on
our
last
stop
during
our
tour
of
all
things
beer
in
charleston
on
the
bus
toasted
to
this
one
at
6pm
on
may
21
2011
in
celebration
of
the
predicted
judgement
day
served
from
bottle
into
a
pilsner
poured
a
deep
redorange
with
a
one
and
a
half
finger
light
tan
head
that
subsided
to
a
minimal
amount
slowly
maintained
nice
lacing
throughout
the
glass
the
aroma
was
comprised
of
sweet
malt
raisins
dark
fruit
and
sweet
alcohol
the
flavor
was
of
sweet
malt
roasted
malt
raisins
dark
fruit
and
sweet
alcohol
it
had
a
medium
feel
on
the
palate
with
high
carbonation
overall
this
was
a
pretty
good
brew
the
raisins
really
made
their
presence
known
for
sure
and
were
quite
enjoyable
they
really
mixed
well
with
the
roastiness
going
on
here
the
alcohol
was
just
a
touch
and
not
overwhelming
at
all
if
i
could
do
it
again
i
would
choose
another
beer
to
crack
on
judgement
day
but
this
one
just
felt
right
overall
i
really
dont
care
for
lost
abbey
and
their
high
levels
of
carbonation
in
their
beers
apart
from
that
i
really
enjoyed
this
beer
quite
a
bit
i
thought
it
had
a
great
flavor
was
pretty
easy
to
drink
o
this
one
is
okay
better
than
pretty
things
far
lacking
against
rochefort
10
my
quad
quest
continues
final
thought
5
and
10
abv
this
is
a
beer
i
love
huge
and
you
only
need
one
thanks
lost
abbey
im
sorry
but
i
thought
this
beer
was
downright
terrible
cant
recommend
it
medium
mouthfeel
but
drinks
very
smoothly
my
first
lost
abbey
brew
and
i
am
definitely
impressed
highly
recommend
this
one
and
now
im
very
much
looking
forward
to
more
from
this
brewery
good
qaud
not
the
best
but
good
o
touch
too
dry
nice
nose
i
expect
a
lot
out
of
my
quads
and
that
being
said
this
is
very
good
beer
however
this
one
falls
just
short
of
the
great
and
worldclass
quads
all
in
all
a
delicious
beer
judgment
day
demands
to
be
sipped
but
is
completely
delicious
nothing
is
offputting
but
tread
carefully
quads
are
not
a
beginners
brew
and
this
beer
doesnt
take
halfsteps
to
accommodate
the
masses
maybe
that
was
the
point
only
the
chosen
few
can
find
salvation
in
an
ale
well
i
dont
know
if
judgment
days
powerful
flavors
are
enough
to
stave
off
gods
wrath
but
they
definitely
go
down
swinging
amen
light
bodied
and
well
carbonated
prickly
on
the
tongue
still
a
bit
of
alcohol
in
this
one
mouthfeel
i
think
its
carbonated
perfectly
and
it
feels
soft
and
slightly
creamy
as
a
result
its
big
without
being
overly
sticky
t
a
bit
of
prickly
carbonation
and
slight
malt
sweetness
upfront
brown
sugar
and
a
tiny
bit
of
raisin
and
prune
in
the
middle
and
then
a
slightly
earthy
finish
thats
bitter
and
a
bit
off
for
me
the
finish
really
doesnt
leave
me
wanting
more
this
is
probably
my
least
favorite
of
the
lost
abbey
offerings
ive
had
to
date
tasted
of
mild
clover
honey
citrus
orange
and
medium
toasted
malt
medium
bodied
and
decently
drinkable
id
like
to
try
this
again
sometime
in
a
larger
quantity
though
the
price
on
this
one
is
a
little
steep
imo
o
decent
not
bad
but
not
great
either
tend
to
be
hesitant
with
some
la
beers
due
to
past
carbonation
issues
unless
im
sure
it
is
at
least
a
2010
bottle
release
since
this
was
shared
with
me
no
loss
even
if
it
was
flat
but
thankfully
it
was
just
fine
a
sipper
to
be
sure
and
i
only
had
about
a
quarter
of
the
bottle
which
was
just
enough
the
one
pours
out
as
a
reddish
brown
color
with
a
very
little
head
no
lacing
on
this
one
really
smells
like
yeast
and
dark
dried
fruits
doesnt
really
give
off
the
aroma
i
was
expecting
from
a
quad
tastes
alcohol
bread
and
fruits
throughout
this
brew
thin
mouthfeel
not
overly
complex
found
this
brew
to
be
a
little
disappointing
i
like
the
raisin
addition
and
it
drinks
like
raisins
eat
sugary
sweet
but
not
too
sugary
sweet
just
right
and
the
script
on
the
back
label
is
worth
reading
carpe
diem
this
beer
pours
a
dark
maron
color
that
becomes
darker
as
it
pours
decent
size
head
and
a
bit
of
lacing
the
smell
is
weak
but
is
fruier
and
sweeter
the
taste
is
on
the
malter
side
and
deffently
sweeter
deffently
can
taste
the
rasins
the
flavor
is
strong
and
dose
stay
on
the
palette
for
a
while
overall
this
is
a
good
quad
but
could
better
a
little
bit
too
much
rasins
a
stronger
alchool
taste
may
help
pours
a
deep
brown
to
black
in
color
with
a
small
tan
head
in
the
aroma
dark
fruit
and
a
dry
alcohol
note
in
the
taste
dark
fruit
especially
raisins
with
just
a
small
burn
of
alcohol
a
small
bite
and
medium
to
lighter
bodied
mouthfeel
with
a
small
dry
raisin
like
fruitiness
in
the
aftertaste
a
bit
thin
but
great
flavor
and
nose
the
brewery
is
well
wortht
the
time
if
youre
in
the
area
and
love
a
good
pint
really
outstanding
beer
not
much
of
an
alcohol
bite
finally
i
get
to
have
a
lost
abbey
brew
with
carbonation
brown
a
bit
of
haze
little
head
or
lace
medium
roast
malt
and
oak
aroma
soft
up
front
with
medium
carbonation
oaky
with
a
touch
of
alcohol
and
rich
sweet
back
end
mildly
biter
the
flavor
builds
gradually
from
start
to
finish
pours
a
murky
prune
juice
color
with
a
puffy
2
inch
light
tan
color
that
lasts
kind
of
dirty
looking
overall
good
rings
of
lace
on
the
glass
on
the
way
down
smells
of
raisins
prunesplums
dark
malt
and
yeast
taste
is
of
raisin
puree
prune
juice
and
dark
bready
malts
beer
seems
excessively
carbonated
soda
like
and
prickles
on
the
way
down
the
throat
slight
alcohol
burn
too
overall
a
good
beer
that
would
be
better
if
the
carbonation
levels
were
dialed
down
o
a
decent
attempt
at
a
quad
but
fall
short
of
being
authentic
nowhere
near
the
rocky
10
or
st
bernies
abt
12
decent
but
doesnt
stand
out
among
other
belgian
quads
for
me
i
will
say
that
the
alcohol
while
present
in
the
flavor
is
very
well
hidden
and
is
well
integrated
into
the
flavor
profile
o
too
much
raisin
an
other
dark
fruits
and
alcohol
for
my
taste
really
missing
the
typical
belgian
sweetness
d
drinkability
is
moderate
it
smells
and
looks
pretty
good
but
the
taste
is
a
bit
of
a
departure
from
the
style
that
i
feel
doesnt
benefit
this
beer
it
is
too
dry
and
doesnt
have
the
signature
sugar
popular
to
other
quads
o
overall
it
is
lacking
the
complexity
i
love
and
the
carbonation
i
expect
it
is
good
for
sure
but
does
not
go
into
the
realm
of
great
drink
as
i
mentioned
a
180
from
what
i
thought
this
was
a
nice
quad
with
good
flavors
and
a
nice
well
masked
abv
would
have
this
again
not
my
favorite
lost
abbey
but
not
my
least
favorite
either
decent
id
be
interested
in
trying
an
aged
version
of
this
o
overall
this
is
a
decent
quad
but
the
carbonation
problem
in
the
mouthfeel
and
the
alcohol
prominence
in
the
nose
and
taste
hurt
it
a
bit
would
give
another
shot
but
would
certainly
want
to
share
the
bottle
next
time
as
opposed
to
tackling
it
by
myself
and
probably
wouldnt
seek
out
pours
a
moderate
brown
color
with
a
bit
of
a
reddish
tint
to
it
good
white
head
and
a
bit
of
lacing
as
it
fell
the
nose
was
really
heavy
on
the
fruit
character
actually
too
much
so
there
was
a
large
amount
of
raisins
in
the
forefront
along
with
a
bit
of
red
grape
and
dark
fruits
in
the
background
the
flavor
was
still
really
heavy
on
the
raisin
character
along
with
a
heavy
dosing
of
sweetness
other
dark
fruits
in
the
background
feel
was
sweet
though
luckily
not
cloying
just
a
bit
too
one
dimensional
as
far
as
im
concerned
notes
for
a
quad
this
beer
was
a
bit
lighter
than
i
expected
however
it
has
a
creamy
mouthfeel
and
is
quite
drinkable
alcohol
is
present
just
enough
to
make
this
beer
a
good
fireside
sipper
pretty
tasty
stuff
pours
a
five
finger
thick
light
brown
head
that
fades
very
slowly
leaving
a
good
lace
cloudy
dark
brown
color
some
yeast
left
in
bottle
good
carbonation
and
medium
bodied
nose
is
dark
fruit
flavor
is
raisins
and
alcohol
smooth
10

for
a
750ml
bottle
from
julios
liquors
westborough
ma
medium
bodied
with
medium
carbonation
there
is
a
little
bit
of
alcohol
heat
but
not
bad
for
a
beer
at
10
50
abv
this
is
a
very
good
quadrupel
which
i
will
need
to
buy
again
drinkability
quite
gentle
for
judgment
day
very
merciful
poured
from
the
nice
corked

5
oz
bottle
into
my
affligem
chalice
wonderful
rich
tan
2
inch
head
with
ridges
and
peaks
and
valleys
and
a
deep
cloudy
brown
color
smell
the
sweetness
of
figs
and
raisins
and
belgian
yeast
tastes
fruity
sweet
raisiny
and
even
some
pears
and
chocolate
mouthfeel
is
medium
bodied
and
it
retains
its
carbonation
drinkability
is
good
despite
the
high
abv
one
bottle
per
sitting
please
will
probably
look
for
this
again
the
drink
ability
isnt
that
great
its
not
bad
beer
at
all
but
to
try
to
get
through
a
whole
big
bottle
of
this
beer
is
gonna
be
tough
750ml
bottle
pours
dark
brown
with
khaki
head
nice
lacing
lots
of
chocolate
caramel
and
dried
fruit
in
the
nose
taste
is
sweet
like
a
tootsie
roll
a
little
metallic
note
that
is
distracting
and
takes
away
from
the
nice
flavor
a
bit
full
bodied
with
a
creamy
sticky
mouthfeel
smooth
finish
with
alcohol
noticeable
in
the
chest
and
throat
this
is
a
nice
beer
d
complex
flavors
but
metallic
notes
and
flat
body
suffer
it
some
alcohol
hidden
well
a
definite
sipper
d
great
flavors
ever
so
smooth
and
deceptively
easy
drinking
at

abv

d
the
lack
of
carbonation
is
puzzling
but
this
is
still
a
quality
brew
very
nice
abtquad
especially
considering
how
fresh
it
is
really
probably
should
let
this
sit
a
bit
but
lost
abbey
just
hit
the
store
today
and
i
couldnt
resist
so
smooth
i
really
wish
i
knew
the
age
on
this
bottle
its
phenomenal
well
thats
what
i
get
for
being
cocky
an
excellent
american
quad
slight
alcohol
burn
but
the
next
drink
brings
the
smooth
candy
d
not
one
of
my
favorite
quads
but
not
that
bad
not
to
much
drinkability
on
this
one
pours
a
very
dark
brown
that
turn
ruby
red
when
held
up
to
the
light
with
a
medium
offwhite
head
that
slowly
diminishes
aroma
alcohol
with
dark
fruits
and
slight
hint
of
chocolate
taste
is
initially
a
lot
of
dark
fruits
raisins
plums
dates
prunes
and
cherries
followed
by
some
roasted
almond
flavor
then
i
get
a
bit
of
chocolate
followed
by
some
booziness
mouthfeel
is
fullbodied
and
creamy
nice
smooth
finish
drinkability
is
fair
not
my
favorite
representation
of
a
quad
but
definitely
brings
its
own
uniqueness
too
the
table
this
beer
pours
a
dark
brown
with
purple
on
the
edges
and
no
head
it
smells
of
dark
fruits
mainly
raisins
and
some
brown
sugar
tastes
very
much
the
same
and
is
a
great
american
quad
full
bodied
not
super
easy
to
drink
and
i
got
drunk
off
one
bottle
would
buy
again
anyway
for
the
highly
experiencedthis
beer
offers
all
the
strength
of
a
barleywine
without
the
overpowering
esters
of
a
typical
belgian
or
the
hops
of
a
double
ipa
definitely
a
unique
beer
worth
trying
several
times
poured
ontap
at
the
portlost
abbey
brewery
the
beer
is
a
dark
brown
with
a
filmy
light
head
no
smell
to
speak
of
light
undertones
of
malty
sweet
the
beer
has
heavy
flavors
of
dark
malt
and
molasses
and
is
heavy
sweet
even
for
a
quadrupel
the
molasses
is
also
present
on
the
finish
but
is
balanced
out
with
some
cinnamon
tastes
the
oversweet
flavors
makes
this
a
tough
one
to
drink
and
the
beer
fell
short
for
my
wife
and
i
both
somewhat
disappointing
d
its
very
nicely
drinkable
but
maybe
its
too
easy
to
drink
i
split
a
bomber
with
my
friend
and
it
went
a
little
to
quickly
i
would
love
to
try
it
off
tap
dbecause
the
alcohol
comes
through
so
strongly
it
does
not
go
down
easily
or
quickly
and
i
definitely
wouldnt
want
to
drink
a
lot
in
a
short
amount
of
time
that
being
said
it
makes
a
great
dessert
beer
i
am
getting
pretty
tiered
of
sub
par
lost
abbey
products
i
am
pretty
much
done
with
their
offerings
after
this
not
something
i
would
recommend
judgement
day
falls
short
of
perfection
but
that
doesnt
stop
it
from
being
an
exceptional
beer
d
i
didnt
like
this
one
so
much
so
i
wont
be
drinking
it
for
a
while
especially
at
the
price
maybe
with
a
little
more
experience
i
can
appreciate
it
but
i
cant
say
drinkability
belowaverage
quad
not
a
bad
beer
overall
but
ive
had
several
quads
that
were
better
in
my
opinion
ruby
brown
appearance
with
moderate
light
brown
head
smell
is
sweettoffee
belgian
yeast
notes
and
raisins
flavor
is
dominated
by
the
figsraisonsplums
spectrum
of
things
with
a
bit
of
sweet
malt
on
the
end
pillowy
in
the
mouth
though
not
as
smooth
as
it
could
be
ok
drinkability
a
bit
sweet
and
rests
too
heavily
on
raisins
a
weak
pop
of
the
cork
told
me
there
may
be
carbonation
issues
not
major
but
it
certainly
lacked
the
nice
smooth
belgian
cap
that
im
used
to
seeing
in
my
quadsbsdas
deep
mahogany
and
a
few
trails
of
bubbles
dark
chocolate
rich
caramel
figs
slight
touch
of
toffee
maybe
a
hint
of
clove
nicely
blended
oily
and
slick
body
this
isnt
really
dry
at
all
carbonation
is
moderate
at
best
but
this
actually
drinks
pretty
well
so
ill
take
it
this
beer
is
good
but
la
definitely
has
some
better
offers
drinkability
kind
of
a
weird
brew
to
be
honest
which
is
why
the
weird
reviews
end
up
happening
as
far
as
the
numbers
go
i
feel
like
this
may
sincerely
be
one
thats
meant
for
cellaring
right
now
as
i
stated
the
booze
is
too
much
kind
of
and
if
im
saying
that
its
something
that
said
theres
still
a
lot
to
admire
especially
in
its
ballsiness
and
raucousness
which
i
can
dig
sometimes
cellar
it
see
what
happens
now
though
i
wouldnt
recommend
it
for
the
qpr
probably
d
this
is
an
unusual
and
complex
quad
but
a
great
sipper
thanks
to
the
red
wine
qualities
high
drinkability
but
eventually
itd
but
me
under
the
table
at
10
5
d
not
as
good
as
the
trappist
quads
but
still
a
good
take
on
the
style
worth
picking
up
a
bottle
or
a
glass
if
you
see
it
around
d
very
good
beer
but
the
booze
is
too
strong
to
drink
fast
or
in
large
quantites
tasty
poured
a
dark
murky
brown
with
brown
highlights
that
had
a
absolutely
no
head
and
no
lacing
the
aroma
was
big
on
the
dark
fruits
like
raisins
with
toffee
booze
slight
chocolate
and
faint
molasses
notes
lingering
in
the
background
the
taste
was
pretty
damn
boozy
with
raisins
notes
like
the
nose
but
it
did
have
toffee
molasses
and
a
touch
of
maple
accents
the
brew
was
medium
in
body
with
absolutely
no
carbonation
which
had
a
sweet
sticky
and
boozy
finish
it
drank
alright
and
had
me
twisted
after
i
was
done
with
the
bottle
because
i
drank
it
to
the
neck
imo
it
was
too
hot
but
still
tasty
without
any
carbonation
this
beer
weighs
in
at
a
heavy
10
5
abv
and
does
it
amazingly
it
is
not
your
session
beer
but
would
be
pretty
impressive
in
place
of
a
dessert
wine
after
a
nice
dinner
d
this
strikes
me
as
the
type
of
beer
that
is
trying
to
impress
you
with
its
high
abv
and
bold
flavor
but
is
severely
lacking
in
the
complexity
and
drinkability
department
something
like
the
guy
who
drives
a
big
truck
to
compensate
for
his
small
penis
interesting
to
try
but
i
wont
be
coming
back
for
more
d
really
nice
quad
with
a
great
flavor
profile
d
the
high
abv
and
sweetness
makes
this
one
a
good
one
to
share
d
delicious
overall
flavors
and
great
beer
the
abv
is
on
the
high
side
and
it
is
quite
complex
in
flavors
rating
from
backlog
which
was
from
memory
bottle
poured
deep
brown
with
absolutely
no
head
i
was
immediately
concerned
that
the
bottle
was
flat
and
it
pretty
much
was
flavor
was
alot
of
the
round
chewy
malt
i
find
in
lost
abbey
beers
with
raisins
plums
prunes
and
some
nuts
good
malt
complexity
as
is
often
the
case
with
these
guys
carbonation
would
have
been
a
good
thing
in
this
instance
it
was
a
2008
bottle
i
believe
cheers
d
paired
wonderfully
with
a
ground
sirloin
cheddar
burger
on
a
brioche
roll
with
spicy
fries
i
hope
i
come
across
this
brew
again
soon
once
i
popped
the
cork
i
knew
this
was
going
to
be
one
of
the
socalled
flat
lost
abbey
ales
the
pour
revealed
a
very
dark
brown
beer
with
little
to
zero
head
the
nose
was
reminiscent
of
raisins
dark
fruit
dried
cherries
and
lots
of
hot
booze
the
taste
was
very
similar
i
am
a
very
big
fan
of
the
dark
fruit
flavors
of
lost
abbey
and
this
beer
did
not
disappoint
it
had
all
the
wonderful
pieces
i
love
i
felt
the
composition
of
this
beer
was
slightly
off
base
due
to
the
lack
of
carbonation
it
did
however
have
an
incredibly
smooth
velvet
like
feel
which
i
enjoy
thoroughly
overall
i
am
a
bit
perplexed
by
this
beer
there
are
parts
which
i
love
and
parts
that
i
absolutely
cant
stand
i
think
i
might
have
to
retry
this
beer
and
hopefully
i
will
get
a
product
that
is
able
top
to
bottom
full
of
quality
instead
of
the
halfassed
beer
i
drank
drinkability
a
bit
to
alcoholic
for
a
beer
i
would
really
be
interested
in
going
back
to
on
occasion
i
can
see
this
beer
being
good
after
a
hearty
dinner
it
really
didnt
blow
me
away
very
tasty
beer
somehow
i
was
able
to
down
3
tulips
and
still
want
more
jd
d
pretty
drinkable
considering
the
abv
good
stuff
o
glad
to
try
this
not
a
huge
clove
fan
but
otherwise
its
a
great
beer
das
a
quad
lover
this
beer
is
nothing
worth
going
all
out
for
certainly
not
a
bad
beer
by
any
stretch
lots
of
alcohol
in
the
finish
and
a
little
too
much
raisin
in
this
guy
i
found
myself
a
little
let
down
particularly
with
how
my
hype
lost
abbey
gets
some
deserved
of
course
but
this
one
falls
a
tad
short
i
was
expecting
more
depth
of
flavor
or
generally
a
more
potent
ale
with
this
one
but
compared
to
true
belgian
quads
this
is
somewhat
dull
lost
found
abbey
ale
their
dubbel
is
superior
in
its
use
of
raisins
ill
be
sticking
with
that
one
taste
follows
the
nose
and
is
pleasant
and
actually
a
bit
chalky
for
the
style
nice
cherry
flavors
and
some
chocolate
malt
overall
a
bit
simple
as
for
the
depth
and
character
of
this
beer
as
raisins
dominate
to
a
fault
quite
nice
and
enjoyable
nonetheless
yet
certainly
not
exceptional
d
ill
stick
to
one
snifter
thanks
a
strong
quad
both
in
terms
of
booze
and
flavor
probably
not
the
best
idea
to
down
this
right
before
kbs
this
is
nice
attempt
at
a
quad
and
its
a
pretty
good
beer
having
said
that
i
didnt
enjoy
it
as
much
as
the
4
or
5
other
lost
abbeyport
beers
which
ive
had
all
in
all
this
is
an
ok
brew
smelled
so
good
but
the
taste
was
not
on
point
with
smell
at
all
not
worth
hunting
down
many
better
brews
in
the
style
smell
was
very
reminiscent
of
bourbon
county
stout
but
taste
was
not
eh
d
great
smooth
and
tasty
the
abv
is
not
immediately
obvious
but
eventually
jumps
out
and
smacks
you
d
this
quad
went
down
rather
easily
but
it
caught
up
to
me
the
alcohol
is
hidden
nicely
behind
the
sweetness
going
on
this
one
was
nice
with
the
age
on
it
the
beer
pours
dark
brown
with
a
tan
head
the
aroma
is
raisins
alcohol
and
brown
sugar
the
flavor
is
awesome
with
raisins
brown
sugar
milk
chocolate
alcohol
and
belgian
yeast
medium
mouthfeel
and
medium
carbonation
dont
drink
and
review
d
nicely
drinkable
given
the
high
abv
the
mild
astringency
and
solvent
notes
take
away
from
my
overall
impression
of
drinkability
but
its
something
that
id
like
to
have
again
nonetheless
big
thanks
go
out
to
josh
for
this
pleasant
surprise
d
big
and
bold
with
a
high
abv
impacts
drinkability
but
im
not
having
any
trouble
working
through
this
750
final
thoughts
again
this
is
a
good
quad
especially
from
the
us
but
not
the
best
lost
abbey
has
better
brews
as
well
drinkability
ok
d
its
not
bad
but
not
good
i
would
not
recommend
tis
to
anyone
i
wouldnt
say
its
horrible
but
i
will
not
seek
it
out
or
recommend
it
blah
drinkability
a
nice
and
complex
quad
that
is
very
raisin
friendly
i
do
like
raisin
and
bread
combination
i
would
get
this
again
but
have
other
favorites
from
the
brewery
corked
bottle
opened
with
a
pop
that
sent
the
cork
flying
through
the
air
pours
a
dark
amber
brown
color
it
presents
itself
with
more
than
a
finger
of
fluffy
dark
tan
head
that
has
really
good
retension
and
tons
of
lace
clinging
to
the
glass
nose
is
a
sweet
aroma
slightly
yeasty
and
with
hints
of
berries
and
some
dark
mellow
fruit
like
plums
or
raisins
touch
of
hops
is
slightly
noticeable
in
the
back
end
with
a
bit
of
citrus
character
taste
is
a
punch
of
alcohol
with
some
bitterness
induced
by
the
hops
mild
carbonation
and
a
thick
feel
to
this
beer
lingering
taste
of
dark
fruit
riddled
with
alcohol
is
left
in
the
mouth
along
with
a
noticable
warming
factor
on
tap
at
the
red
in
santa
cruz
poured
into
a
snifter
nice
deep
brown
color
with
a
great
fluffy
khaki
head
aroma
shoots
out
from
the
glass
molasses
cinnamon
dates
fruitcake
flavor
with
a
hearty
sweet
maltiness
some
yeasty
notes
plenty
of
overripe
fruit
a
bit
of
chocolatecocoa
brown
sugar
and
a
perfect
spiciness
my
only
complains
are
the
slightly
toothin
body
and
the
short
finish
that
results
but
this
is
definitely
one
of
the
best
american
quads
around
on
the
heavier
side
of
mediumbodied
with
a
good
amount
of
carbonation
dont
know
if
ill
make
it
through
the
whole
bottle
but
ill
certainly
try
the
beer
pours
a
dark
black
color
with
a
thick
frothy
tan
head
that
slowly
fades
to
lacing
the
aroma
is
good
it
has
a
warm
caramel
malt
sweetness
along
with
some
dark
fruits
and
belgian
yeast
esters
its
rich
with
a
bit
of
warmth
the
taste
is
decent
it
has
a
dry
roasted
flavor
with
some
moderate
caramel
sweetness
and
some
belgian
yeast
character
the
mouthfeel
is
fine
it
is
a
full
bodied
beer
with
adequate
carbonation
this
is
a
tasty
beer
with
a
great
deal
of
complexity
im
not
a
huge
fan
of
the
dry
roastedness
but
it
goes
down
smooth
and
finishes
with
a
nice
yeast
fruitiness
on
tap
at
the
brewery
pours
a
dark
purplelish
brown
color
aromas
of
fig
raisins
dates
flavors
of
sweet
malt
belgian
yeast
dark
fruits
and
chocolate
nicely
carbonated
with
welldisguised
alcohol
i
could
drink
a
lot
of
this
and
regret
it
in
the
morning
o
tasty
quad
might
be
better
with
some
more
time
on
it
body
should
be
thicker
and
not
so
much
sweetness
left
behind
with
that
said
i
did
finish
the
bottle
but
i
dont
think
i
will
be
buying
this
again
d
an
easy
to
drink
flavorful
quad
that
goes
down
smooth
despite
it
high
alcohol
content
the
flavors
are
powerful
and
perhaps
syrupy
at
times
but
to
me
this
does
not
detract
from
the
beers
overall
presentation
drinkability
easy
drinking
for
a
belgian
quad
kind
of
pricey
tho
overall
was
another
solid
offering
from
lost
abbey
and
an
interesting
belgian
quadrupel
i
would
certainly
drink
this
again
but
its
price
is
certainly
a
bit
high
and
with
similarly
priced
belgians
i
would
most
likely
reach
for
something
else
recommended
the
strong
flavors
of
the
beer
mask
the
high
alcohol
content
and
at
the
same
time
make
this
beer
a
unique
experience
but
also
make
it
trying
to
drink
at
times
not
my
favorite
quad
and
not
my
favorite
offering
from
the
lost
abbey
nonetheless
judgment
day
is
a
fine
quirky
quad
worth
filling
and
emptying
a
glass
solid
not
spectacular
but
good
d
if
you
take
your
time
you
can
get
down
1
750
ml
beer
yourself
its
pretty
drinkable
just
not
the
best
quad
i
have
had
its
good
not
great
drinkability
is
solid
overall
pretty
good
but
not
quite
at
the
top
tier
of
belgian
quads
out
there
d
definitely
a
sipper
but
something
i
could
have
a
few
glasses
of
not
overly
interesting
taste
however
wow
so
much
better
than
last
time
very
good
nicely
carbonated
lots
of
sweet
fruits
good
complexity
reminds
me
a
little
of
wine
creamy
mouthfeel
great
beer
this
wants
to
be
a
quaditd
be
better
if
it
were
a
quadand
while
its
certainly
got
the
sugar
and
booze
punch
of
a
quad
its
lacking
the
yeast
and
spice
complexities
it
tastes
like
more
like
fantastically
expired
juice
750ml
bottle
this
one
pours
a
very
dark
ruby
color
there
was
about
no
head
on
it
this
one
has
a
big
nose
raisins
some
alcohol
some
toffee
caramel
bready
and
lots
of
other
stuff
it
has
a
very
rich
taste
toffee
caramel
raisin
dark
fruits
slight
alcohol
brown
sugar
and
lots
of
other
good
stuff
i
would
definitely
have
this
one
again
and
again
its
dark
though
the
head
doesnt
retain
well
the
aroma
is
hot
at
first
though
as
it
warms
lots
of
raisins
and
prunes
emerge
the
same
could
also
be
said
about
the
taste
somewhat
what
at
first
with
the
prunes
and
raisins
dominant
as
it
warms
the
booze
cools
lots
of
pure
maltiness
in
this
one
some
yeast
mediumheavy
in
the
mouth
but
most
of
the
alcohol
is
shielded
soft
its
a
good
one
especially
as
it
warms
a
interesting
quad
with
a
twist
of
raisin
to
enhance
the
dark
fruitiness
of
the
style
a
very
dark
brown
with
a
dense
cloudiness
from
the
yeast
smell
is
rich
and
fruity
with
notes
of
raisins
dates
figs
chocolate
dark
sweet
breads
and
yeasty
dough
taste
is
full
of
the
above
caramel
malt
backbone
is
delicious
there
is
a
light
alcohol
edge
well
integrated
so
as
not
to
upset
the
balance
finish
is
full
of
cocoa
with
mild
and
complex
hops
bitter
but
gentle
they
give
a
somewhat
clean
profile
to
the
finish
but
it
lingers
with
caramel
graham
chocolate
and
subtle
coffee
a
tasty
biscuit
flavor
as
well
feel
is
full
and
chewy
with
a
creamy
carbonation
this
is
what
makes
it
a
quad
versus
a
bsda
imho
a
good
sipper
for
the
winter
nights
it
brings
you
back
again
and
again
overall
this
is
a
well
done
beer
however
i
think
it
may
be
more
up
the
alley
of
a
bsda
more
so
than
a
quad
regardless
its
tasty
and
worth
a
shot
this
drinks
way
easier
than
it
should
d
so
much
potential
but
it
came
off
as
really
disgusting
with
the
poorly
blended
abv
and
complete
lack
of
head
i
paid
about
10
per
bottle
my
first
in
march
was
flat
my
second
a
year
after
release
is
also
flat
christ
md
a
decent
mouthfeel
lost
points
on
drinability
due
to
the
taste
all
and
all
i
dont
think
i
will
try
this
one
again
the
10
abv
doesnt
justify
the
suffering
glad
i
finally
got
to
try
this
one
i
will
trade
for
a
few
i
would
like
to
put
them
away
for
a
while
and
see
what
develops
dnice
stuff
nicely
complex
with
an
interesting
collection
of
flavours
certainly
not
a
classic
quad
but
well
crafted
and
interesting
deep
french
onion
soup
color
maybe
a
weak
cherry
cough
syrup
color
pours
completely
flat
no
sign
of
any
head
same
goes
for
the
lacing
zippo
really
quite
lifeless
knew
when
i
popped
the
cork
and
there
was
no
sound
that
something
may
not
be
right
scent
is
quite
nice
though
lots
of
dark
fruit
including
raisins
dates
and
figs
a
touch
of
alcohol
as
well
there
does
happen
to
be
a
bit
of
carbonation
left
but
not
much
just
enough
to
keep
it
from
becoming
a
drain
pour
almost
cask
style
flavor
mirrors
the
nose
lots
of
raisin
flavors
make
that
booze
soaked
raisins
really
a
one
flavor
shop
here
d
pretty
drinkable
for
10
5
even
with
obvious
alcoholic
notes
i
think
the
carbonation
needs
to
be
a
bit
higher
though
this
is
a
good
beer
to
put
away
a
750
milliliter
slowly
on
a
dark
winter
evening
mouthfeel
is
good
and
very
drinkable
for
this
abv
overall
not
bad
but
for
what
it
is
id
find
another
alternative
after
thinking
about
it
for
a
few
days
i
decided
to
edit
my
review
a
bit
i
figured
i
was
too
generous
the
first
time
around
not
sure
if
it
was
due
to
getting
a
bad
bottle
but
this
beer
was
basically
undrinkable
i
described
it
to
co
workers
as
tasting
like
paint
thinner
i
try
my
hardest
to
finish
beer
i
buy
as
i
dont
like
to
be
wasteful
but
most
of
this
went
down
the
drain
mouthfeel
is
medium
bodied
and
smooth
mellow
carbonation
works
well
here
imho
and
this
bottle
is
far
from
flat
overall
tasty
but
its
still
not
near
what
i
remember
mother
of
all
beers
being
will
need
to
snag
another
fresh
bottle
sometime
this
one
pours
a
dark
cloudy
brown
with
a
one
finger
yellow
head
smells
of
figs
and
raisins
an
intense
aroma
tastes
of
figs
grapes
raisins
and
malt
in
a
pleasing
if
not
overly
complex
flavor
carbonation
is
fine
and
id
love
to
rate
drinkability
higher
but
this
is
a
pretty
heavy
beer
that
you
have
to
take
your
time
with
overall
a
fine
american
version
of
the
style
d
a
little
too
sweet
for
much
more
than
a
halfbottle
of
this
one
big
thanks
to
kaggie97
for
the
bottle
overall
this
is
more
of
a
sipper
for
me
but
i
do
like
it
a
lot
of
flavor
i
wouldnt
like
drinking
the
entire
bottle
by
myself
but
half
was
a
great
amount
d
its
very
tasty
but
the
booze
takes
away
from
the
drinkability
a
bit
still
a
great
beer
d
its
a
big
beer
its
nice
to
drink
but
i
cant
see
anyone
plowing
back
multiple
bottles
this
beer
would
be
more
drinkable
if
it
wasnt
for
the
10
5
alcohol
after
awhile
you
definitely
know
the
alcohol
is
there
d
nice
flavors
but
didnt
blow
me
away
the
alcohol
is
a
bit
hot
and
the
carbonation
level
a
bit
low
both
that
may
have
been
helped
by
more
aging
but
i
held
this
a
good
year
plus
glad
to
have
the
bottle
and
glad
to
hit
1000
reviews
very
dark
brown
beer
with
a
slowly
fading
head
aroma
is
mostly
dark
fruit
taste
is
figraisin
and
booze
a
tasty
warming
beer
that
was
really
not
meant
to
be
drunk
in
the
summereven
so
it
was
an
overall
positive
experience
i
would
recommend
and
would
purchase
again
in
the
colder
months
drinkability
is
pretty
good
its
an
interesting
and
complex
beer
but
its
also
a
bit
much
its
going
to
take
me
a
while
to
get
through
the
bottle
still
well
worth
trying
though
pours
a
hazy
deep
amberbrown
with
a
minimal
beige
head
aroma
is
moderately
sweet
with
raisin
prune
and
light
alcohol
flavor
is
raisin
plum
pomegranate
caramel
and
dark
chocolate
sticky
full
body
with
low
carbonation
finish
is
dry
and
very
woody
d
i
would
love
to
try
this
one
again
a
750ml
corked
bottle
split
with
psycohops
i
knew
something
was
a
muck
when
i
opened
the
bottle
the
cork
was
loose
and
slid
out
willingly
i
was
greeted
by
a
slight
hiccup
upon
removal
kinda
equivalent
to
the
mighty
roar
of
a
tit
mouse
appears
the
color
of
root
beer
with
barely
half
an
inch
of
light
ecru
foam
the
foam
vanished
within
seconds
leaving
no
trace
aroma
flavor
prunes
raisins
dark
cherries
yeast
candied
apples
decent
body
but
quite
lacking
in
the
carbonation
dept
the
low
carbonation
makes
this
one
a
bit
hard
to
drink
and
enjoy
conclusion
this
was
quite
nice
a
drinkable
quad
full
of
character
this
really
shone
with
pairings
however
it
was
great
as
a
dessert
course
with
german
butterkase
cheese
dried
figs
and
dark
belgian
chocolate
a
wonderfully
complex
brew
that
although
the
alcohol
is
present
drinks
quite
easily
for
abv
a
unique
brew
that
is
raisiny
but
balanced
very
welldone
d
at
this
launch
party
i
remember
tomme
saying
that
the
first
batch
of
portla
beer
intended
for
chicago
had
been
bottled
and
sitting
for
two
months
already
and
not
to
judge
his
beer
based
on
the
initial
offerings
like
he
was
apologizing
for
it
or
something
why
bring
your
beer
to
a
new
market
if
ots
not
firing
on
all
cylinders
so
far
everything
ive
tried
that
i
bought
that
night
has
been
goodbut
not
worthy
of
the
hushed
reverent
tones
that
people
gush
over
their
products
in
dont
know
if
ill
spend
any
more
on
their
beer
d
about
a
glass
is
all
i
want
and
im
not
sure
i
will
seek
it
out
again
though
it
might
be
an
excellent
dessert
drink
however
the
main
point
here
is
that
this
thing
was
cloyingly
sweet
like
my
first
attempt
at
brewing
a
barley
wine
before
i
understand
concepts
of
residual
sweetness
resulting
in
me
dumping
that
batch
down
the
drain
this
thing
was
so
sweet
i
thought
it
did
not
get
properly
fermented
so
i
logged
onto
lost
abbeys
web
site
and
got
their
beginning
and
finishing
gravities
and
checked
it
with
my
hydrometer
it
was
to
my
surprise
attenuated
as
advertised
sickingly
sweet
and
no
carbonation
i
can
only
hope
this
was
some
experiment
batch
or
there
are
quality
control
issues
going
on
at
lost
abbey
because
it
was
horrible
ill
stick
to
the
other
quads
in
the
future
color
is
a
deep
mahogony
bordering
on
black
thin
tan
head
that
didnt
last
long
aroma
of
raisins
belgian
yeast
and
vanilla
also
plenty
of
vanilla
in
the
flavor
with
other
sweet
malt
flavor
some
warming
alcohol
burn
packs
a
punch
full
bodied
and
nicely
carbonated
another
good
lost
abbey
beer
thanks
again
clvand0
drinkability
is
hurt
about
as
much
as
the
taste
is
boozey
thick
startlingly
i
didnt
have
any
trouble
finishing
the
bottle
which
is
kind
of
amazing
i
really
this
will
be
a
knockout
once
they
get
the
bottling
issues
fixed
ontap
at
the
farmhouse
in
emmaus
pa
served
in
a
wine
glass
it
appears
a
very
dark
brown
with
a
tan
head
quite
dark
for
a
quad
but
there
are
faint
red
highlight
when
held
up
to
the
light
at
first
i
get
a
candy
plum
note
but
that
quickly
fades
leaving
to
big
dark
chocolate
flavors
along
with
raisin
and
very
mild
peppermint
notes
the
aroma
also
sticks
with
the
chocolate
but
it
reminds
me
of
a
creamier
fine
milk
chocolate
finishes
with
a
roasted
orange
bitterness
from
the
mix
of
hops
and
malt
thick
but
reasonable
for
a
10
5
beer
certainly
not
your
average
quad
but
a
great
dessert
beer
notes
this
is
the
1st
lost
abby
beer
i
have
had
i
kind
of
disappointed
because
they
get
so
much
hype
all
and
all
this
is
a
tasty
beer
typical
body
for
the
style
perhaps
just
a
little
thin
not
as
drinkable
as
most
due
to
lack
of
a
feature
flavor
overall
a
solid
if
unspectacular
example
of
the
style
try
it
if
you
see
it
oh
dear
given
what
ive
read
in
several
posts
about
this
brewery
i
cant
help
but
wonder
if
this
bottle
was
the
result
of
some
inconsistency
on
their
end
considering
the
fact
that
i
paid
about
11
for
this
bottle
i
had
really
high
hopes
for
this
beer
and
the
utter
absence
of
carbonation
practically
nullified
all
the
good
qualities
it
had
going
for
it
the
label
claims
that
it
has
an
abv
of
10
5
but
god
bless
america
ive
enjoyed
beers
of
higher
alcohol
content
that
poured
with
pretty
downright
respectable
heads
i
may
try
this
again
in
the
future
as
im
quite
certain
that
this
beer
was
supposed
to
have
a
bit
of
carbonation
to
it
but
i
will
be
then
as
i
am
now
extremely
skeptical
a
very
rich
and
flavorful
brew
plenty
of
subtle
complexity
that
keeps
things
interesting
so
smooth
and
drinkable
recommended
very
nice
quad
that
is
quite
a
bit
different
than
most
i
really
liked
it
looking
forward
to
more
d
a
solid
brew
that
disappeared
too
quickly
worth
drinking
again
d
easy
to
drink
but
still
very
hot
and
boozy
did
i
just
say
that
im
losing
my
edge
pours
a
dark
brown
with
little
head
sweet
smell
of
plumbs
fills
the
nostrells
without
even
lifting
the
glass
a
closer
take
reveals
a
refined
blend
of
spices
taste
is
very
very
complex
easily
the
most
complex
dark
beer
ive
taste
and
one
of
the
best
dark
plumbs
raisins
and
old
prunes
sweetness
balanced
by
spices
and
a
wonderfull
ripe
fruit
aftertaste
alcohol
hidden
very
well
amazing
brew
pretty
damn
tasty
and
complex
too
bad
its
a
flat
beer
that
cost
me
13
00
and
have
cellared
for
two
years
had
high
expectations
for
this
brew
since
ive
had
other
lost
abbey
creations
that
have
been
downright
incredible
it
tasted
more
like
a
stout
than
a
belgian
quad
my
reference
point
for
quads
are
westvleteren
12
rochefort
10
and
pannepot
this
beer
tastes
fuller
and
more
enjoyable
when
it
not
that
cold
but
it
is
more
drinkable
and
smoother
then
it
is
very
cold
im
not
a
stout
fan
due
to
the
nutty
strength
in
the
taste
no
much
lacing
on
the
belgian
tulip
glass
that
i
poured
it
in
no
head
and
didnt
expect
much
cabonation
since
it
was
classified
as
a
quad
there
is
chocolate
overtone
trying
to
fight
through
the
strong
nutty
smell
the
raisins
didnt
punch
through
for
me
this
beer
takes
some
getting
used
to
and
if
you
can
experience
a
full
bottle
in
one
sitting
for
yourself
im
sure
youll
have
lot
to
talk
about
on
this
one
overall
drinkability
is
good
i
wouldnt
seek
it
out
but
i
wouldnt
turn
it
down
either
its
strange
to
think
of
a
beer
that
earns
a
4
5
for
flavor
as
an
opportunity
lost
but
thats
how
i
feel
about
judgment
day
having
said
that
i
have
a
world
of
faith
in
tomme
arthur
and
will
buy
beaucoup
bottles
of
this
beautiful
brew
whenever
the
opporutunity
presents
itself
tasty
would
get
this
again
poured
into
my
duvel
tulip
glass
poured
a
rich
black
with
a
slight
redish
purple
at
its
thinist
point
had
tons
of
thick
tan
head
on
it
that
stuck
around
for
a
bit
then
settled
to
a
thin
lacing
around
the
glass
the
sent
is
hops
mollases
and
strong
alchoal
and
a
hint
of
fruit
the
taste
is
alchoal
at
first
sip
that
is
burbon
like
then
strong
maltey
molasseses
and
a
bitter
bite
their
is
hints
of
plums
and
raisins
maby
a
tuch
of
coffiee
their
is
not
much
that
i
like
about
this
beer
it
gets
slightley
better
as
it
warms
but
still
i
dont
like
it
gess
its
just
not
my
thing
d
this
is
a
great
quad
and
one
of
my
favorites
the
taste
is
great
and
that
is
what
is
important
about
it
for
me
the
10
5
was
hidden
pretty
well
this
is
a
great
job
done
by
lost
abbey
and
is
one
of
my
favorite
beers
of
theirs
that
i
have
had
so
far
this
makes
me
really
want
to
get
my
hands
on
cuvee
de
tomme
once
this
beer
was
in
my
mouth
i
didnt
quite
want
to
spit
it
out
but
looked
at
finishing
the
750
more
as
an
obligation
rather
than
something
i
would
enjoy
thanks
to
brewerb
i
think
i
had
this
once
before
at
portlost
abbey
but
i
sure
dont
remember
it
being
this
tasty
i
was
actually
surprised
how
much
i
liked
this
but
then
i
remembered
my
experience
with
lost
and
found
dark
brown
minimal
bubbles
smells
good
malty
licorice
raisin
brown
sugar
tastes
like
grapes
and
syrup
in
a
good
way
a
little
harder
to
drink
as
it
was
viscous
like
a
stout
overall
a
nice
selection
but
cant
say
i
would
purchase
again
not
a
top
quad
d
as
interesting
and
weird
as
it
is
it
does
go
down
pretty
easily
i
wouldnt
recommend
it
as
a
first
quad
as
it
is
very
unique
to
the
style
but
drinking
a
750ml
of
this
isnt
too
hard
interesting
beer
but
not
at
all
what
i
expected
for
a
quad
no
head
after
numerous
hard
pours
cherry
juice
and
merlot
colors
no
bubbling
or
foam
plums
black
cherries
and
black
currants
make
up
a
mix
of
malty
and
yeast
good
aroma
the
alcohol
gives
a
winey
aire
to
the
fruits
in
the
noise
blackberry
maniscewitz
currants
cooked
black
cherries
and
baked
plums
with
maybe
a
hint
of
brandy
coated
fruit
cake
winey
grapes
and
raisins
comes
from
the
yeast
and
alcohol
combo
wet
fruity
hot
palate
that
feels
more
like
a
merlot
than
a
quad
i
can
just
barely
feel
the
carbonation
not
a
bad
sipper
crazy
easy
drinking
for
a
beer
of
such
size
but
im
a
sucker
for
good
quads
mom
drained
her
goblet
lickety
split
having
no
clue
it
was
10abv
until
i
told
her
later
draft
dec
2008
cocoa
caramel
noted
on
the
nose
warm
sugary
sweet
pleasant
bubble
gum
component
as
well
as
alcohol
noted
light
holiday
spices
are
present
as
well
more
drinkable
than
expected
also
has
a
rather
musty
cave
like
flavor
pours
luxurious
brown
to
black
with
contrasting
head
that
doesnt
retain
too
long
this
is
certainly
not
in
the
class
of
the
best
quads
but
its
definitely
a
solid
brew
with
an
interesting
fruitiness
that
makes
it
slightly
unique
id
say
this
is
a
pretty
damn
good
beer
nothing
that
is
going
to
blow
st
bernardus
or
westy
out
of
the
water
but
a
strong
effort
by
one
of
the
best
breweries
in
the
world
would
like
to
see
how
this
one
ages
murky
brown
pour
with
absolutely
no
head
i
tried
to
force
one
out
and
there
was
nothing
raisins
prunes
brown
sugar
dank
yeast
and
earth
in
the
aroma
sweet
but
a
little
smoky
in
the
taste
molasses
more
raisins
toasted
bread
and
dusty
yeast
esters
mix
well
the
lack
of
carbonation
gives
this
a
syrupy
liquerlike
quality
still
this
is
very
good
pours
a
very
dark
brown
with
small
beige
head
like
all
of
the
beers
in
this
series
the
aroma
is
dominated
by
dark
fruits
especially
raisin
also
a
bit
more
alcohol
in
the
scent
complex
taste
with
a
nice
balance
of
dark
fruits
figs
chocolate
and
alcohol
a
bit
too
much
alcohol
taste
and
warmth
that
takes
away
from
the
smoothness
of
a
beer
like
their
lost
and
found
d
real
good
smooth
a
good
example
of
a
quad
d
a
nice
domestic
attempt
at
a
huge
belgian
style
im
glad
i
can
finally
get
this
in
chicago
will
check
this
one
out
again
later
but
more
than
one
in
a
sitting
wouldnt
be
the
best
idea
given
the
massive
abv
overall
a
drinkable
beer
though
it
takes
commitment
to
finish
the
bottle
alone
d
a
very
interesting
beer
that
only
became
more
so
as
it
warmed
the
aroma
was
incredible
and
the
taste
was
nearly
as
good
i
will
have
this
one
again
for
sure
d
drinking
decently
but
definitely
over
the
hill
d
really
good
some
flaws
in
the
carbonation
department
from
what
i
hear
2
years
mellowed
this
out
quite
a
bit
notes
from
71507
disappointing
but
i
have
access
to
some
of
the
best
quads
around
so
i
can
pass
it
up
without
remorse
75cl
bottle
looks
black
in
the
glass
but
a
backlight
reveals
a
deep
red
color
topped
with
a
fine
beige
head
good
foam
retention
aroma
of
raisin
lots
of
toffee
vanilla
almonds
and
molasses
plenty
of
vanilla
in
the
flavor
with
almond
raisin
and
other
dark
sugars
surprisingly
little
alcohol
and
a
controlled
sweetness
silky
and
full
mouthfeel
but
a
bit
undercarbonated
for
the
style
pretty
tasty
on
the
whole
with
interesting
and
complex
flavors
i
think
more
carbonation
would
have
done
wonders
for
this
though
regardles
of
my
drinkability
notes
a
good
belgian
brew
to
try
if
you
havent
had
it
before
that
being
said
its
worth
the
effort
to
try
it
corked
and
caged
750ml
bottle
into
a
duvel
tulip
pours
a
nice
almost
opaque
dark
brown
with
a
thin
head
that
lasts
as
a
thin
layer
aroma
is
loads
of
dark
malts
and
dried
fruits
with
some
molasses
and
slight
spice
the
taste
is
a
nice
plethora
of
dried
fruits
and
sweet
molasses
the
beer
is
medium
bodied
with
well
hidden
alcohol
and
decent
carbonation
this
is
a
somewhat
enjoyable
beer
but
not
what
id
expect
from
lost
abbey
not
as
complex
of
a
quad
as
i
would
expect
from
this
talented
crew
but
its
still
solid
would
prefer
more
husky
malt
and
maybe
spice
taste
profile
with
a
more
complex
grain
backbone
but
its
still
quite
enjoyable
alcohol
burn
and
excess
fermentation
of
the
raisin
sugars
may
preclude
surpreme
drinkability
a
very
good
beer
perfect
for
sipping
on
a
chilly
evening
d
not
my
favorite
style
but
overall
well
done
a
little
too
sweet
for
my
personal
liking

tancolored
cap
embedded
with
bubbles
and
ringlets
quickly
dissipated
into
a
thin
swirl
of
foam
that
gathered
in
the
center
and
coalesced
around
the
shoulders
some
watery
lacing
but
no
legs
nose
revealed
cocoa
as
well
as
a
vinous
quality
some
alcohol
detected
but
not
overly
boozey
taste
consistent
with
nose
but
also
picked
up
some
additional
dark
fruit
towards
the
back
however
subtle
mouthfeel
is
mediumbodied
and
lightly
effervescent
no
burn
ive
only
had
a
few
quads
but
i
found
the
overall
character
to
be
quite
rich
and
pleasing
drinkability
a
decent
beer
but
it
seems
like
it
got
a
little
too
big
a
little
too
fast
a
good
idea
to
brew
a
quadrupel
w
raisins
they
compliment
each
other
nicely
for
obvious
reasons
but
there
were
a
few
too
many
phenols
a
few
too
many
funny
chemically
notes
in
the
alcohol
profile
understandable
when
it
gets
this
high
in
terms
of
abv
but
still
still
its
interesting
and
worth
trying
once
if
you
enjoy
the
style
unfortunately
i
have
acquired
a
couple
of
the
bottles
that
have
the
known
corking
problem
this
opened
with
no
pop
and
poured
a
carbonationless
liquid
the
smell
is
great
rich
dark
fruits
mostly
the
clearly
stated
raisin
but
more
dark
cherry
blackberry
as
well
the
taste
is
quite
good
full
on
the
mouthfeel
and
rich
i
prefer
my
beers
not
overly
carbonated
and
this
is
surprisingly
good
it
needs
just
a
hint
of
carbonation
to
add
to
the
mouthfeel
and
to
slow
down
my
consumption
of
this
thing
without
the
carbonation
to
slow
you
down
this
thing
just
goes
quick
a
very
satisfying
beer
that
is
close
to
the
way
i
like
them
just
needs
a
touch
of
carbonation
and
this
would
be
top
shelf
overall
this
was
a
great
quad
it
is
a
nice
sweet
quad
that
does
well
for
the
style
at
10
a
bottle
there
are
so
many
better
options
sorry
tomme
but
my
first
lost
abbey
experience
was
not
very
enjoyable
i
had
a
hard
time
finishing
the
bottle
not
impressed
at
all
with
this
one
had
a
ton
of
better
quads
and
i
really
enjoy
the
style
i
finished
the
bottle
but
not
one
of
my
favorites
i
split
the
bottle
with
3
other
people
and
still
did
not
want
to
finish
my
glass
drinkability
is
pretty
good
but
this
is
a
rich
thick
spicy
brew
that
begets
slow
sipping
still
each
one
is
more
enjoyable
then
the
last
nevertheless
the
char
reminds
me
of
my
homebrewed
quad
where
i
felt
that
i
overcaramelized
the
sugar
or
maybe
its
just
the
raisins
either
way
its
thick
and
very
spicy
and
could
use
more
time
in
the
cellar
ive
only
had
this
bottle
for
about
a
month
or
so
but
ill
save
the
other
one
for
another
year
at
least
this
is
my
4th
or
5th
lost
abbey
brew
and
im
feeling
like
their
a
little
overrated
still
i
love
belgians
and
think
its
great
they
have
a
whole
label
dedicated
to
producing
them
but
there
are
better
examples
from
the
other
side
of
the
pond
that
are
equally
if
not
better
priced
d
having
this
as
an
after
dinner
treat
not
on
my
session
list
but
a
real
treat
taste
is
thick
roasted
malts
figs
prunes
raisins
dark
chocolate
alcohol
is
present
at
first
then
fades
away
end
is
dry
with
a
slight
amount
of
bitterness
and
a
nutty
aftertaste
drinkability
like
i
said
before
its
not
much
to
look
at
other
than
the
bottle
but
at
least
this
beer
kicked
into
gear
at
the
aroma
and
never
looked
back
would
i
drink
this
beer
again
when
and
if
judgement
day
ever
comes
i
would
more
than
likely
go
for
something
better
but
it
would
make
a
nice
choice
if
that
fateful
day
ever
comes
pours
very
dark
purple
to
black
smells
fruity
of
grapes
alcohol
and
malts
lots
of
phenol
and
ethanol
on
the
nose
taste
is
fruity
and
phenolic
and
malty
creamy
milk
chocolate
prunes
raisins
a
bit
of
maple
syrup
finish
brings
a
reduction
of
the
fruitiness
and
a
growing
roasted
toasty
dark
chocolate
and
graininess
fairly
full
bodied
even
heavy
a
nice
beer
though
not
anything
outstanding
imo
pours
black
with
some
noticeable
sediment
light
head
but
sticks
around
as
a
ring
smells
sweet
with
malt
and
raisins
and
some
other
dark
fruit
the
taste
is
a
little
bit
hot
there
are
flavors
of
raisins
toffee
figs
and
sweet
malt
the
hotness
certainly
hurts
the
drinkability
as
does
the
sweetness
this
is
a
fairly
simple
quad
not
bad
but
not
stellar
some
time
in
the
bottle
may
improve
things
oh
and
thanks
t0rin0
this
is
a
pleasantly
drinkable
beer
a
little
more
so
than
i
expected
at
10
5
abv
overall
it
has
some
surprising
subtlety
alcohol
is
mildly
notable
but
not
too
hot
or
fumy
taste
is
not
too
rich
or
heavy
surely
not
the
best
quad
out
there
by
complexity
or
balance
but
very
tasty
and
easy
to
enjoy
i
recommend
not
serving
too
cold
as
much
of
the
appearance
aroma
and
overall
taste
seems
to
improve
nearer
to
room
temp
this
is
pretty
tasty
a
lot
of
raisin
flavor
but
i
like
it
i
could
see
myself
drinking
a
bottle
of
this
every
now
and
again
tanninlike
bitterness
up
front
herbal
hops
dark
fruit
figs
raisins
sweetness
settles
in
vinous
grapes
lightly
roasted
bitterness
on
the
edge
bittersweet
dark
chocolate
is
there
as
well
sugary
plums
before
a
rather
warming
finish
a
little
boozy
with
lingering
dark
fruits
tangy
grapes
and
tanninlike
bitterness
nice
mediumfull
body
with
a
creamy
feel
maybe
a
tad
rough
around
the
edges
and
a
little
boozy
but
all
in
all
a
nice
americanbrewed
quad
lost
abbey
has
a
winner
here
judgement
day
really
impressed
on
all
levels
and
is
sinfully
drinkable
for
such
a
big
beer
highly
recommended
variant
to
the
typical
belgian
quads
750
ml
served
in
my
arendsnest
glass
pours
fairly
dark
and
appears
murky
brown
in
the
glass
quickly
diminishing
head
aromatically
im
not
impressed
however
i
think
the
flavor
is
very
impressive
in
particular
it
becomes
very
complex
after
the
midpalate
with
a
pleasant
sweetness
hints
of
brandy
soaked
fruits
caramel
cocoa
and
hops
very
big
and
thick
a
great
sipper
that
gets
better
as
it
warms
up
another
fantastic
beer
from
tomme
and
lost
abbey
i
really
enjoyed
this
one
and
would
highly
recommend
it
d
actually
surprisingly
drinkable
for
the
flavor
and
alcohol
i
had
to
fight
to
savor
it
judgment
day
is
simply
delicious
and
a
fine
take
on
an
american
quad
if
it
comes
your
way
make
sure
to
wave
down
a
horseman
and
snag
a
bottle
judgement
day
is
a
strong
flavorful
ale
that
just
didnt
quite
hit
the
spot
for
me
it
seems
to
incorporate
elements
of
a
stout
or
porter
into
the
quadrupel
style
that
dont
quite
mesh
with
my
idea
of
what
that
ought
to
be
i
enjoyed
my
snifter
but
likely
wont
be
back
decent
at
best
for
a
lighter
belgian
style
ale
it
is
far
from
a
quadrupel
except
in
alcohol
content
if
i
am
going
to
rate
this
as
a
quadrupel
it
might
be
one
of
the
worst
the
sourness
in
the
smell
is
nowhere
to
be
found
in
the
taste
the
dark
fruit
flavors
are
there
but
they
do
not
have
the
sourness
or
even
any
real
sweetness
to
them
there
are
also
some
slightly
roasted
malt
notes
but
the
prevaling
flavors
are
tha
distinct
belgian
spiciness
and
alcohol
it
has
a
nice
creamy
mouthfeel
and
the
carbonation
is
pleasant
overall
it
is
certainly
not
the
best
belgian
quad
around
the
alcohol
overpowers
any
of
the
more
intricate
flavors
and
the
result
is
not
entirely
positive
the
taste
is
dark
chocolate
very
boozey
raisins
plums
brown
sugar
with
a
syrupy
mouthfeel
the
taste
mirrors
the
nose
the
hops
take
a
back
seat
in
thie
quad
some
bitterness
is
apparent
but
this
is
a
sweet
beer
overall
i
liked
this
offering
i
would
perhaps
aged
this
beer
and
see
what
might
happen
drank
very
easy
for
the
style
abv
a
good
not
great
quad
could
get
better
with
time
but
seems
pretty
much
peaked
out
to
me
md
alcoholic
feel
all
the
down
the
throat
but
kinda
bland
on
the
tongue
it
had
an
ok
drinkability
not
my
favorite
though
i
highly
recommend
as
that
christmas
beer
the
whole
family
can
enjoy
around
the
fire
pours
opque
brown
with
a
swirly
brownish
head
nose
is
dominated
by
funky
heavy
fruit
raisin
taste
is
pretty
funky
also
no
sweetness
just
heavy
and
bitter
also
i
get
that
gagging
feeling
i
get
whenever
i
eat
mediocre
raisins
but
after
you
down
the
first
glass
it
really
doesnt
matter
because
the
abv
creeps
up
pours
a
dark
almost
black
with
very
slight
brown
highlights
when
held
to
light
minimal
head
and
lacing
aroma
hits
first
with
dried
fruits
figs
some
light
chocolate
then
some
yeast
taste
brings
some
more
fruits
some
malt
a
bit
of
alcohol
and
spicy
yeast
a
few
sips
in
and
im
hit
with
some
sweet
rum
and
hints
of
chocolate
some
phenolic
tastes
hidden
under
there
too
lots
of
sweetness
in
the
aftertaste
as
well
thick
body
crisp
carbonation
definitely
a
sipper
nice
big
bold
belgian
style
ale
dark
as
hell
think
root
beer
with
decent
head
and
good
lacing
yeasty
on
the
nose
definetly
smells
like
a
belgian
oddly
enough
the
yeast
does
not
come
through
on
the
buds
malt
malt
and
more
malt
with
sugary
sweet
plumb
raisin
toffee
notes
slight
alcohol
warmth
well
integrated
for
a
10
percenter
this
one
is
a
tough
call
if
you
are
into
strong
dark
belgians
a
more
than
solid
offering
but
overall
nothing
spectacular
the
body
is
big
and
very
solvent
with
alcohol
more
of
a
sipping
beer
with
all
the
complexity
and
huge
alcohol
notes
feels
like
it
should
be
twice
the
gravity
it
is
overall
not
bad
but
i
could
see
how
people
would
not
enjoy
this
beer
d
great
sipping
beer
but
a
little
strong
on
the
alcohol
and
a
little
too
sweet
by
the
end
of
a
glass
would
have
again
interesting
take
on
a
quad
drinkability
need
to
get
my
hands
on
a
fresh
one
of
these
tried
to
imagine
i
was
drinking
a
cask
version
but
it
just
wasnt
happening
good
flavor
kept
it
from
being
a
drain
pour
if
fresh
this
is
probably
damn
tasty
drinkability
a
good
wellcrafted
quad
from
lost
abbey
i
certainly
had
no
trouble
emptying
my
glass
my
least
favorite
beer
from
lost
abbey
lacks
the
complexity
an
uniqueness
that
their
other
beers
have
could
drink
any
more
beer
after
having
this
other
night
would
not
drink
again
only
worth
trying
if
you
were
curious
like
me
md
full
bodied
but
slightly
thin
alcohol
is
there
drinkability
is
ok
its
a
sipper
a
solid
beer
but
nothing
overly
redeeming
about
it
d
great
sipper
dark
fizzy
cola
brown
small
tan
head
of
foam
dies
quickly
aromas
of
raisins
dark
fruits
figs
candy
sugar
and
yeast
pretty
straight
forward
and
one
dimensional
but
solid
taste
is
a
bit
heavy
dark
ruum
boozy
raisins
fig
again
candi
sugar
etc
smooth
and
easy
on
the
tongue
velvet
like
heavy
mouthfeel
very
well
executed
carbonation
level
drinkability
is
good
not
the
best
brew
ever
but
certainly
a
respectable
stab
at
the
style
d
this
is
deffinately
an
intense
beer
great
but
a
little
intense
im
not
sure
how
many
of
these
i
would
want
to
drink
in
a
row
but
i
know
i
will
have
one
again
some
day
after
enjoying
a
bottle
i
realized
that
i
should
not
be
driving
nor
operating
heavy
machinery
beware
the
judgement
day
drinkability
lost
abbey
makes
good
beer
thats
all
there
is
to
it
if
you
dont
believe
me
try
some
for
yourself
a
perfect
brown
body
almost
has
a
blackened
effect
to
it
as
it
lets
through
no
light
head
reaches
about
an
inch
and
a
half
of
rich
tan
fuzz
that
has
decent
retention
nose
has
a
nice
mix
of
soured
dark
fruits
with
hints
of
banana
bread
and
seet
figs
as
this
beer
enters
the
mouth
it
gels
to
a
solid
mix
of
dark
fruit
of
bitter
dryness
is
the
result
of
a
balanced
pairing
of
soft
spiceness
and
rich
burnt
carmalized
malts
the
darkness
that
this
beer
creates
really
paints
the
mouth
alchol
is
hidden
quite
well
this
beer
really
punishes
the
mouth
and
the
drinkability
is
slightly
hurt
by
this
overall
damn
damn
delicious
reminds
me
a
lot
of
a
vintage
thomas
hardys
i
dont
get
a
lot
of
belgian
character
okay
almost
none
but
its
still
damned
tasty
i
love
port
san
marcos
brewery
i
had
this
one
on
tap
and
there
judgement
day
seemed
a
little
less
boozey
poured
into
a
chalice
a
deep
black
color
some
carbonation
tiny
fizzy

not
much
sticky

at
all
but
some
oil

the
nose
is
malty
slight

and
some
caramel
the
taste
is
slightly
sweet
at
first
malty
dark
fruit
slight
alcohol
and
caramel
medium
body
slightly
chewy
complex
brew
very
drinkable
a
nice
brew
there
is
a
slight
twist
on
the
style
though
with
this
one
cheers
not
particularly
impressive
seems
that
a
lot
of
breweries
in
the
us
have
trouble
when
their
belgianstyle
beers
go
over
10
abv
the
flavors
are
nice
but
are
overshadowed
by
the
alcohol
taste
overall
i
really
enjoyed
this
beer
i
have
had
better
quads
but
this
is
still
worth
trying
i
would
get
it
again
if
it
was
available
here
pours
a
hazy
reddish

beer
poured
agressively
into
a
duvel
tulip
that
produced
a
momentary
head
it
is
a
very
interesting
color
combination
of
a
brownish
purple
nose
is
of
alcohol
soaked
sweet
dark
fruits
and
has
hints
of
chocolate
in
the
background
taste
was
initially
strong
of
booze
soaked
raisins
but
with
subsequent
sips
is
somewhat
chocolately
up
front
with
the
dark
fruit
light
hopped
finish
mouthfeel
is
thinner
than
i
would
expect
and
does
not
have
the
classic
belgian
feel
to
it
drinkability
is
good
as
it
has
quite
the
nice
taste
profile
with
a
slight
warming
alcohol
back
burn
this
is
a
very
nice
beer
like
all
the
others
i
have
had
from
portlost
abbey
recommend
that
you
try
this
at
least
once
poured
aggressively
yields
a
thin
ring
of
tiny
bubbles
around
the
edge
almost
no
lacing
the
smell
is
amazing
rich
chocolate
cherries
and
gooey
raisins
the
mouth
feel
lacks
the
effervescent
character
of
the
best
belgian
variety
of
this
style
but
overall
this
one
is
a
winner
the
tang
from
the
alcohol
invokes
defensive
involuntary
sipping
mechanisms
in
the
brain
it
has
a
lighter
body
but
the
rich
full
dark
fruit
flavor
combined
with
the
cherryvanilla
aspect
of
the
alcohol
keep
your
senses
occupied
wow
i
will
not
pass
this
one
up
if
i
see
it
again
really
enjoyed
this
one
from
table
vine
in
springfield
ma
highly
recommended
this
one
poured
a
clear
ruby
red
nearly
purple
with
a
thin
ring
of
very
fine
beige
bubbles
spotty
lacing
nice

with
a

malt
dried

tobacco
and
a

flavour
some
semisweet
chocolate
and

pleasant
warmth
in

tasty
d
a
solid
specimen
overall
i
would
have
to
say
this
was
excellent
really
a
stunning
brew
and
i
was
glad
i
was
able
to
try
it
i
had
not
had
anything
really
big
from
lost
abbey
before
and
this
was
a
very
nice
introduction
to
their
crafts
i
look
forward
to
being
able
to
try
everything
they
offer
and
really
being
able
to
explore
a
lot
of
these
great
flavors
definitely
would
have
to
recommend
this
one
pours
very
dark
brown
with
no
head
nose
is
raisins
touch
of
antiseptic
wood
and
just
a
funky
edge
to
it
but
not
an
overpowering
one
flavor
is
smooth
nice
even
qualities
to
it
with
a
minor
sweet
edge
feel
is
smooth
with
a
good
carbonation
to
it
easily
drinkable
a
well
balanced
quad
with
a
sufficient
enough
edge
to
make
it
interesting
ive
got
another
bottle
of
this
that
ill
be
sitting
on
perhaps
not
until
judgement
day
but
for
a
few
more
years
anyway
d
3
5
i
can
only
really
enjoy
this
is
small
amounts
dthe
alcohol
is
a
bit
too
noticeable
which
drops
this
down
a
little
perhaps
a
bit
more
aging
would
tone
it
down
that
said
this
is
a
complex
and
tasty
brew
just
not
one
i
would
have
everyday
the
toasted
bitterness
is
a
nice
surprise
and
plays
well
with
the
dark
fruity
sweetness
drinkability
is
great
bit
of
warmth
from
the
alcohol
but
still
balanced
and
very
drinkable
belgian
style
bomber
caged
and
corked
wo

info
this
one
opened
with
a
whimpy
poof
and
then
poured
w
next
to
no

no

and
no
lacing
hmmm
things
pick
up
with
the
raisiny
nose
and
then
full
throttle
tasty
raisiny
notes
picked
up
in
the

more
quality
brew
from
l
a
port
brewing
bottle
poured
a
dark
burgundy
color
ale
with
a
small
foamy
head
with
not
much
retention
and
minimal
lacing
aroma
of
dry
figs
and
plums
with
some
subtle
notes
of
alcohol
taste
of
dry
figs
and
plums
is
dominating
with
some
rich
and
sweet
belgian
malt
body
is
quite
full
with
some
medium
carbonation
a
bit
too
sweet
overall
for
my
liking
and
it
is
missing
something
complexitywise
not
bad
but
definitely
not
what
i
was
expecting
from
this
well
renowned
brewer
a
drinkable
beer
but
not
one
i
would
rave
about
worth
a
try
and
solid
through
and
through
this
beer
is
like
a
bb
student
solid
but
unremarkable
a
complex
beer
worth
getting
to
know
but
ultimately
not
quite
as
glorious
in
flavor
as
it
is
in
complexity
poured
from
a
bomber
into
a
tulip
glass
thin
tan
head
that
dissipates
quickly
to
a
rim
around
the
glass
nearly
black
body
with
tiny
bubbles
streaming
up
the
glass
dark
and
almost
intimidating
looking
up
through
the
beer
you
can
tell
it
is
clear
despite
the
darkness
and
this
perspective
shows
a
dark
chestnut
color
warm
fruity
aroma
with
notes
of
prune
brown
sugar
spice
and
alcohol
nice
roasted
malt
with
a
hint
of
milk
chocolate
initial
flavor
with
light
bitter
aftertaste
that
is
relatively
long
lived
with
an
alcohol
finish
this
brew
comes
across
almost
as
a
strong
stoutbarley
wine
cross
it
is
full
bodied
with
slightly
syruppy
feel
that
coats
the
side
of
your
tongue
and
the
back
of
your
throat
the
lively
almost
fizzy
carbonation
keeps
it
ffrom
feeling
too
heavy
overall
this
beer
has
a
nice
subtle
aroma
that
is
reliatively
complex
and
pleasant
the
taste
is
excellent
and
the
mouthfeel
is
nicely
balanced
with
a
full
body
that
is
lightened
a
little
by
the
carbonation
i
would
definitely
purchase
again
the
beer
pours
from
the
750ml
cork
and
caged
bottle
a
rather
hazy
brownish
red
with
a
large
creamy
light
tan
head
that
fades
away
leaving
a
velum
like
coating
of
lace
nose
is
rich
in
sweet
malt
fruit
aromas
id
say
cherries
with
a
bit
of
raisins
start
is
fruity
sweet
the
malt
presence
makes
the
top
feel
moderate
touch
of
alcohol
bitterness
at
the
back
finish
has
a
spiny
acidity
alcohol
warms
the
belly
and
hops
provide
some
spiciness
dry
and
long
lasting
aftertaste
quite
a
nice
drinking
beer
overall
judgment
day
is
still
tasty
just
not
that
drinkable
interesting
obviously
an
above
average
and
enjoyable
beer
but
just
not
up
to
what
other
lost
abbey
beers
have
afforded
me
after
being
impressed
with
many
other
la
beers
i
was
extremely
disappointed
in
judgment
day
thought
maybe
i
got
a
bad
bottle
but
after
reading
the
last
review
guess
it
wasnt
just
me
i
had
the
same
problem
with
the
cork
just
flopping
out
and
almost
no
carbonation
in
the
beer
poured
a
hazy
chocolate
milk
color
smelled
like
raisin
puree
and
had
one
of
the
worse
mouthfeels
i
have
ever
had
in
a
beer
i
would
seriously
drink
bmc
over
this
beer
bummer
mouthfeel
is
surprisingly
light
and
well
attenuated
this
is
a
beer
that
inspires
deep
and
concentrated
thought
complex
and
very
flavorful
my
third
lost
abbey
brew
and
i
am
extremely
impressed
highly
recommended
d
a
big
ale
the
quad
doesnt
hold
back
this
quad
is
brewed
with
finesse
and
a
dash
of
raisins
the
raisin
flavor
comes
out
en
force
an
extremely
drinkable
beer
for
the
strength
i
would
take
a
taste
of
this
any
time
there
is
someone
who
is
willing
to
split
one
note
trying
it
again
mid2011
and
while
the
carbonation
is
gentle
it
is
much
more
developed
than
in
my
previous
two
tastings
of
this
beer
poured
in
a
heavy
glass
chalice
formed
a
shortlived
uneven
layer
of
bubbles
over
the
clear
burgundy
brew
lacing
is
dainty
but
ample
and
admirable
aroma
is
rich
with
dark
fruits
and
dark
malts
taste
is
moderate
dark
sweetness
upfront
tints
of
fruit
in
the
center
and
a
slowcoming
alcohol
warming
to
close
mouthfeel
is
smooth
but
i
find
this
one
a
little
limited
in
drinkability
the
flavors
just
dont
come
together
for
me
probably
my
personal
preference
nonetheless
a
nice
brew

a

epitome

d
good
for
a
big
beer
a
little
cloying
but
nice
very
warming
and
tasty
a
little
better
than
average
drinkability
but
it
could
be
better
i
have
to
wonder
if
there
is
a
cork
seal
problem
with
this
batch
this
as
fresh
as
it
gets
without
getting
it
handed
to
me
immediately
after
bottling
and
it
is
very
low
on
the
bubbles
after
stories
of
people
getting
off
bottles
of
this
i
can
say
that
i
have
had
four
of
these
now
purchased
from
three
different
parts
of
the
country
that
have
not
been
off
having
said
that
this
beer
could
use
a
bit
of
work
it
is
not
at
the
level
of
excellence
that
the
last
bottle
of
moab
that
i
had
was
perhaps
i
shouldnt
order
beers
based
on
the
label
art
andor
name
shrug
still
it
was
interesting
i
think
ill
settle
for
worth
trying
if
you
can
share
with
several
friends
who
really
dig
big
dark
complex
beers
me
i
think
i
wouldve
been
happier
sticking
with
more
de
dolle
and
gouden
carolus
and
the
like
so
it
goes
after
6
years
peter
fm
brings
a
bottle
some
sourness
and
lots
of
sweetness
pepper
cloves
n
taste
a
unique
invigorating
aroma
of
spice
fruit
overall
i
like
this
beer
i
liked
it
when
it
was
brewed
at
solana
and
i
like
it
now
different
name
same
great
beer
the
mother
of
all
beers
this
is
a
very
nice
beer
but
im
not
hugely
impressed
by
it
also
drinkability
is
not
its
best
attribute
the
malt
covers
some
of
the
alcohol
but
its
still
pretty
noticeable
not
sure
i
will
want
to
buy
this
one
again
i
enjoy
a
good
dark
belgium
ale
and
this
one
is
an
excellent
interpretation
of
the
style
good
job
tommy
pours
a
murky
muddy
colored
cider
brown
small
light
tan
head
cloves
and
spices
in
the
aroma
blend
with
a
nice
toasted
breadiness
sweet
rich
prune
and
raisiny
aromas
as
well
and
a
hint
of
some
alcohol
strength
sweet
maltiness
and
belgian
sugars
blends
with
licorice
and
more
clove
and
spice
and
breadiness
in
the
taste
sweet
raisins
are
also
present
but
are
in
the
background
of
the
spiced
bread
taste
alcohol
is
very
well
balanced
in
the
taste
just
a
hint
of
its
strength
in
a
warming
and
somewhat
dry
finish
the
closer
to
room
temp
this
one
got
the
better
it
became
slightly
sticky
and
sweet
but
very
nicely
done
this
one
can
probably
age
well
d
it
is
good
but
not
one
of
my
favorite
offerings
from
lost
abbey
still
a
great
beer
though
very
interesting
and
different
i
sure
do
love
my
raisins
in
beer
too
predictably
dark
abbey
good
color
terrible
head
the
smell
is
very
portlike
very
robust
and
raisiny
taste
follows
suit
big
malty
huge
dark
fruit
notes
mouthfeel
is
much
thinner
than
one
would
expect
which
belies
the
whopping
10
5
alcohol
content
the
drinkablility
of
this
is
therefore
very
high
it
goes
down
like
a
session
beer
with
a
much
bigger
flavor
take
this
into
account
when
consuming
this
big
bad
quad
i
look
forward
to
trying
more
offerings
from
this
brewery
highly
recommended
my
favorite
so
far
of
the
lost
abbey
offerings
ill
be
picking
up
some
more
of
this
drinkability
the
alcohol
comes
through
a
bit
too
much
taking
away
from
some
of
the
drinkability
still
this
is
a
well
crafted
and
tasted
beer
that
paired
well
with
grilled
tritip
steamed
broccoli
and
herb
roasted
potatoes
the
fruit
flavors
are
rich
and
meaty
and
hold
up
very
well
to
the
sweetness
and
alcohol
warmth
drink
it
if
you
got
it
d
this
beer
needs
time
to
find
itself
as
delicious
as
it
is
now
where
it
will
be
in
3
years
is
unfathomable
thick
glug
pour
love
that
sound
very
dark
fruit
forward
aroma
first
sip
i
knew
i
was
in
for
a
treat
this
has
a
definite
raisin
flavor
i
taste
only
a
slight
resemblence
to
dfh
raisin
dextra
which
is
way
sweeter
i
like
this
more
its
balanced
complex
and
simply
unique
glad
i
have
a
few
more
to
sit
on
and
see
how
it
matures
so
far
every
beer
i
have
had
from
port
brewinglost
abbey
has
been
outstanding
last
swigs
quad
disguised
as
a
belgian
strong
definetly
worth
gittin
yer
greedy
mitts
on
some
notes
750ml
bottle
corked
and
caged
i
have
been
in
a
belgian
strong
funk
lately
so
to
speak
this
has
revived
my
interest
in
the
style
not
as
sweet
as
most
this
is
complex
and
a
6
month
spell
in
the
cellar
may
be
the
key
to
perfection
here
d
ok
i
dont
think
anyones
going
to
be
powering
through
this
entire
bomber
find
someone
to
share
this
with
sip
and
savor
it
im
going
to
dig
up
some
strong
cheese
to
go
with
my
second
glass
maybe
some
dark
chocolate
cheers
the
taste
is
all
of
the
above
with
a
good
strong
helping
of
alcohol
to
warm
you
up
complex
strong
and
did
i
mention
sweet
it
truly
does
taste
quite
delicious
if
you
are
accustomed
too
this
style
if
not
give
it
a
try
and
you
just
might
like
it
overall
decent
but
if
there
was
carbonation
it
would
probably
be
a
lot
better
it
would
pop
more
and
lack
of
brightness
and
nice
characters
have
a
tough
time
coming
through
serving
type
bottle
awesome
brew
get
some
plain
and
simple
this
tastes
gross
until
the
absolute
finish
and
then
it
sweetens
up
and
tastes
like
the
base
beer
really
disappointed
by
this
one
as
i
love
regular
judgment
day
the
flavor
follows
with
that
sweetness
and
thin
alcohol
flavor
the
beer
moves
onto
some
cinnamon
and
spice
but
very
light
then
onto
a
finish
of
caramel
but
the
beer
is
generally
lacking
in
its
abv
with
mouthfeel
or
balance
finally
a
small
format
la
bottle
that
was
carbonated
sadly
a
bit
too
much
lots
of
booze
but
melded
well
good
amount
of
spice
little
chile
but
a
nice
treat
and
a
sipper
o
worldclass
reminds
of
rochefort
8
with
cinnamon
spice
raisins
added
didnt
get
a
whole
lot
of
bourbon
but
a
really
complex
beer
very
delicious
worth
15
o
better
colder
strangely
sippable
fun
and
engaging
highly
recommended
stellar
taste
lots
of
raisin
with
definite
hints
of
the
chiles
this
beer
reminds
me
of
huna
quite
amazing
cant
tell
that
its
almost
14
alcohol
not
at
all
very
smooth
gorgeous
mouth
feel
as
well
overall
this
is
amazing
one
of
the
best
beers
that
i
have
had
in
a
while
o
much
better
once
you
burn
off
some
of
the
carbonation
the
flavors
are
definitely
love
it
or
hate
it
i
enjoyed
this
for
what
it
was
but
probably
would
never
go
out
of
my
way
to
drink
it
again
d
huge
way
too
big
to
have
more
than
one
small
one
or
so
there
is
a
lot
going
on
with
this
beer
it
is
awesome
and
complex
a
little
hot
alcohol
i
wish
i
had
a
few
more
so
i
could
lay
them
down
for
a
year
or
too
o
delicious
complex
and
well
balanced
a
heavyweight
in
the
arms
race
of
huge
beers
big
raisin
character
with
some
heat
in
the
finish
like
the
beer
i
thought
the
raisin
was
a
little
too
much
the
bourbon
flavor
is
definitely
there
and
a
smooth
compliment
to
the
rest
of
the
flavors
both
times
that
i
tried
this
i
rated
it
4
5
on
ut
and
am
sticking
with
that
wow
mindblowing
stuff
take
stickee
monkee
and
hunahpu
and
put
them
together
and
you
have
this
bad
boy
great
overall
flavor
not
getting
any
chili
heat
maybe
a
chili
sweetness
whatever
the
hell
this
beer
is
supposed
to
be
its
delicious
i
still
cant
justify
the
17
99
price
tag
but
damn
this
brew
tried
hard
the
tastes
are
integrated
closer
than
the
sax
riffs
in
a
morphine
jag
excellent
beer
damn
close
to
elite
overall
its
been
a
while
since
i
have
had
a
barrelaged
beers
from
lost
abbey
and
it
appears
that
they
have
put
the
carbonation
problems
behind
them
this
quad
is
a
real
treat
drinkability
a
nice
quadrupel
a
little
different
with
the
raisinbourbon
but
it
works
poured
into
a
lost
abbey
rastal
san
marco
glass
pours
a
very
dark
mahogany
brown
with
very
little
light
transmission
and
a
two
finger
light
brown
head
with
good
retention
and
lacing
aroma
dominated
by
dark
fruit
and
bourbon
with
dark
sweet
caramel
malt
and
slight
spicing
flavor
is
dark
sweet
malt
dark
dried
fruit
bourbon
light
oak
and
just
the
right
light
touch
of
chili
pepper
chile
and
cinnamon
become
more
evident
in
the
rich
finish
but
do
not
dominate
medium
bodied
with
a
pleasant
light
creaminess
an
incredibly
well
balanced
and
integrated
dark
strong
ale
that
doesnt
seem
to
me
to
have
much
quad
character
leaning
to
the
dark
malt
strong
ale
family
but
whos
arguing
this
is
a
rich
smooth
dark
ale
with
delicious
well
melded
flavors
probably
my
favorite
lost
abbey
to
date
alcohol
is
dangerously
well
covered
i
wanted
to
drink
this
like
a
liquid
dessert
i
really
liked
the
interplay
of
the
chili
with
the
other
flavors
overall
this
is
one
beast
of
an
offering
from
lost
abbey
i
really
enjoyed
how
all
the
elements
worked
together
to
create
one
very
solid
and
tasty
brew
with
all
of
these
ingredients
it
could
have
come
out
a
mess
but
instead
it
came
out
incredibly
cohesive
and
very
tasty
o
a
decent
brew
i
saw
it
and
saw
bourbon
aged
and
had
to
try
it
even
at
17
it
is
a
little
pricey
for
the
product
but
it
is
a
good
experience
maybe
get
one
more
to
let
it
age
might
mellow
on
the
front
a
bit
but
the
smell
is
the
best
part
in
my
opinion
like
a
flat
watered
down
abraxas
overall
this
is
one
of
the
most
intriguingsounding
beers
weve
come
across
in
a
while
there
is
nothing
on
that
list
of
featured
ingredients
that
we
arent
down
for
from
the
first
whiff
we
knew
this
was
going
to
be
an
interesting
one
holy
mint
was
there
even
mint
added
her
dont
think
so
right
when
you
pour
it
you
are
met
by
this
intense
fresh
mint
leafiness
think
mint
schnapps
mint
wow
this
is
likely
a
manifestation
of
the
cinnamon
and
the
high
alcohol
content
but
the
likeness
is
uncanny
the
tastes
comes
out
much
much
more
like
youd
expect
the
only
thing
missing
was
the
chilies
i
cant
tell
if
were
thinking
theyre
there
way
on
the
back
or
if
its
just
the
tacos
we
had
earlier
perhaps
they
are
whats
giving
the
chocolate
maltiness
a
rich
mole
flavoring
either
way
the
taste
is
a
mix
between
cloying
sugary
sweetness
and
intense
fusel
alcohol
the
flavors
are
mostly
there
as
we
said
but
lost
a
bit
to
this
struggle
even
the
malts
are
lost
and
thats
the
beers
biggest
detriment
this
is
a
decent
quad
as
a
base
but
it
does
seem
to
have
a
bit
too
much
going
on
o
great
a
very
enjoyable
sipper
o
very
nice
beer
with
some
complex
malt
flavors
complimented
by
the
raisin
and
bourbon
additions
could
use
some
aging
to
reduce
the
heat
of
the
high
alcohol
content
highly
recommended
track
8
is
a
solid
offering
from
the
lost
abbey
but
it
definitely
was
not
worth
18
a
bottle
although
the
flavor
profile
was
interesting
and
well
melded
i
would
have
preferred
something
a
bit
more
exciting
along
with
a
more
flavor
from
the
adjuncts
the
body
is
mediumfull
not
too
thick
or
sticky
and
not
thinning
out
as
the
alcohol
works
through
it
has
a
dryness
pulling
into
the
middle
with
a
crisp
bite
but
still
some
smoothness
even
as
a
gentle
sting
tingles
o
one
meaty
quad
lots
of
flavors
in
here
no
real
sign
of
the
chili
peppers
unfortunately
no
taste
or
heat
and
really
only
very
light
on
the
cinnamon
still
its
quite
a
nice
complex
and
heavy
barrelaged
quad
honestly
funnily
enough
i
think
i
enjoy
the
aroma
more
than
the
flavor
great
o
an
incredible
bourbon
barrel
aged
quad
just
perfect
drink
it
if
you
can
find
it
a
pleasant
enough
rendering
of
a
besotted
woodkissed
quad
the
sweetness
is
somehow
tempered
the
booze
even
more
so
such
that
any
initial
trepidation
is
gone
by
sip
three
or
four
neat
trick
that
im
not
sure
that
the
raisins
cinnamon
or
chiles
really
have
much
blatant
effect
on
the
overall
flavour
its
more
likely
that
they
simply
contribute
to
the
burgeoning
complexity
the
cork
came
out
with
an
unexpected
bang
poured
into
a
snifter
a
dark
brown
color
with
a
full
three
fingers
of
frothy
tan
head
this
is
a
lost
abbey
beer
i
feared
infection
at
first
but
fortunately
that
was
not
the
case
just
uncharacteristically
overcarbonated
once
the
head
dwindled
down
to
a
manageable
level
there
was
an
aroma
of
fruitcake
and
brown
sugar
very
mild
bourbon
notes
in
the
taste
roasty
malts
and
dry
toasted
bread
raisin
midpalate
bringing
in
more
dark
fruits
yeast
hints
of
vanilla
and
fairly
tamed
bourbon
as
the
beer
warmed
i
got
more
of
the
oatmeal
raisin
cookie
sensation
on
the
finish
but
it
wasnt
like
drinking
a
liquid
cookie
as
some
other
people
have
noted
cinnamon
was
also
very
subtle
and
there
was
only
a
slight
chili
burn
in
there
and
again
only
when
the
beer
had
warmed
there
was
a
lot
going
on
in
this
brew
and
with
a
recipe
like
this
the
potential
for
a
huge
mess
is
high
but
everything
here
was
in
pretty
good
balance
with
no
one
characteristic
really
fully
taking
dominance
mediumfull
body
a
little
overcarbonated
but
a
few
swirls
took
care
of
that
overall
a
good
beer
i
wouldnt
buy
a
case
of
it
but
id
definitely
like
to
have
it
again
o
well
balanced
and
composed
brew
no
trace
of
booze
for
the
abv
glad
they
rereleased
this
one
mouthfeel
is
medium
to
heavy
in
body
however
intense
carbonation
cut
through
the
thickness
leaving
it
feeling
light
finishes
with
an
encompassing
numbing
alcohol
overall
solid
beer
and
glad
la
is
in
the
21st
century
however
18
for
this
beer
excuse
me
while
i
lol
la
track
8
for
18
or
fsw
22oz
stickee
monkee
for
14
hmmm
gee
let
me
think
better
off
going
with
the
fsw
you
know
i
was
en
route
to
this
brewery
and
we
stopped
at
stone
brewery
along
the
way
and
thats
where
our
night
became
lights
out
got
pretty
hammered
at
stone
didnt
make
it
to
the
abbey
buuut
there
will
be
a
next
time
soon
we
have
family
out
there
in
san
diego
and
la
immediately
greeted
by
bourbon
on
the
nose
followed
by
big
roasted
malts
toffee
spices
assuming
from
the
chiles
cinnamon
some
oak
and
vanilla
coming
from
the
barrels
in
the
light
it
appears
a
dark
black
with
a
brownish
magenta
foam
rim
and
subtle
alcohol
legs
taste
is
immediate
chile
spice
and
cinnamon
followed
by
big
toffee
oak
raisins
nougat
molasses
candy
sweetness
slick
malt
syrup
and
some
faint
barrel
wood
finish
is
residual
chile
spiciness
which
works
well
with
the
heat
of
the
bourbonalcohol
content
another
homerun
from
lost
abbey
really
rich
and
dark
fruit
forward
beer
a
rating
lucky
to
snag
two
of
these
at
whole
foods
in
pasadena
this
weekend
couldnt
wait
to
pop
one
open
surprisingly
loud
carbonation
pop
when
the
cork
came
out
very
unlike
most
la
bottles
pours
a
dark
brownishpurple
color
with
a
medium
lighttan
head
looks
highly
carbonated
to
me
scent
is
packed
with
dark
fruits
mostly
raisins
lots
of
bourbon
and
hints
of
cinnamon
the
cinnamon
is
huge
in
the
aroma
as
the
beer
warms
up
a
bit
hints
of
lacto
but
that
could
just
be
my
nose
playing
tricks
on
me
taste
is
much
like
the
label
and
description
cinnamon
oat
meal
cookies
suits
this
beer
well
there
is
a
tickling
zing
from
the
chilies
that
dances
around
the
tongue
and
throat
for
a
bit
a
ton
of
raisin
and
cinnamon
subtle
bourbon
but
very
tasty
drinkability
is
fairly
high
for
such
a
big
beer
mouthfeel
is
tad
bit
overcarbonated
in
my
opinion
shocking
i
know
i
know
quads
are
usually
highly
carbonated
but
this
beast
could
do
with
a
tad
less
overall
this
i
a
highly
enjoyable
beer
that
i
am
happy
to
have
gotten
the
opportunity
to
try
im
glad
i
have
another
bottle
to
see
how
this
one
develops
with
time
a
big
rich
delicious
beer
that
uses
its
special
ingredients
well
i
get
a
lot
of
the
raisin
in
this
and
of
course
the
cinnamon
often
spiced
beers
dont
make
sense
to
me
or
are
overdone
or
dont
have
the
body
to
uphold
the
big
flavors
not
the
case
with
the
gem
which
i
guess
has
been
brewed
for
a
second
time
now
since
the
box
was
ages
ago
glad
they
did
big
dark
brown
but
pale
stout
looking
brew
with
a
frothing
tan
head
it
smells
like
smoke
and
cinnamon
dried
fruit
raisins
no
doubt
and
a
whole
bunch
of
barrel
its
complex
but
each
element
makes
a
flash
in
the
taste
with
none
being
lost
and
none
dominating
great
balance
of
difficult
ingredients
chili
is
there
in
flavor
rich
and
earthy
smokey
and
warming
without
ever
getting
hot
on
the
palate
bourbon
balances
it
brilliantly
and
is
rather
intense
a
good
bottle
to
share
especially
with
this
abv
it
gets
real
hot
as
it
warms
thick
and
creamy
feeling
through
never
a
drag
i
am
really
impressed
overall
with
the
depth
of
flavors
in
this
beer
and
with
the
use
of
ingredients
that
dont
always
work
well
in
beer
let
alone
together
top
tier
stuff
i
hope
we
get
to
see
the
other
tracks
again
too
good
yum
a
la
van
enjoyable
barrel
aged
beer
but
leaves
much
to
be
desired
appears
pitch
black
in
the
glass
but
tinges
of
chocolate
brown
show
around
the
edges
when
held
up
to
light
head
is
small
and
quick
to
make
an
exit
nose
is
chocolate
bourbon
barrel
maple
raisins
taste
is
lots
of
chocolate
cinnamon
raisin
fig
wheres
the
alcohol
how
is
this
13
body
is
full
lots
of
carbonation
initially
but
mellows
as
it
warms
overall
a
damn
spectacular
beer
an
instant
favorite
now
to
find
more
as
this
beer
warms
it
opens
up
like
a
fine
wine
very
nice
edit
my
glass
warmed
up
to
just
below
room
temp
and
man
what
a
difference
the
carbos
gone
and
the
mouthfeel
is
great
the
flavors
are
shining
and
gelling
more
im
enjoying
the
heat
in
the
finish
whether
its
from
the
chile
peppers
or
the
alcohol
i
dont
know
i
pulled
it
out
of
my
cellar
thats
kept
at
around
50
degrees
i
recommend
drinking
this
60
degrees
or
higher
solid
brew
overall
its
too
sweet
for
a
quad
but
the
flavors
otherwise
blend
quite
well
d
surprisingly
good
i
was
expecting
a
mess
with
all
the
listed
adjuncts
but
this
turned
out
quite
nicely
could
perhaps
a
bit
more
chile
heat
but
otherwise
things
are
in
balance
and
integrate
well
very
much
like
a
cinnamondusted
and
glazed
oatmeal
raisin
cookie
muddy
brown
body
with
light
carbonation
the
nose
is
remarkably
close
to
an
oatmeal
raisin
cookie
just
with
chili
heat
and
big
bourbon
overtones
the
palate
shows
an
awesome
balance
of
chili
cinnamon
raisin
and
bourbon
sweet
with
a
mediumfull
body
has
a
hint
of
dark
fruit
tartness
in
the
finish
delicious
i
could
drink
a
lot
of
this
pours
a
clear
reddishbrown
with
a
foamy
bone
colored
head
that
settles
to
wisps
of
film
on
top
of
the
beer
small
dots
of
lace
form
around
the
glass
on
the
drink
down
smell
is
of
malt
brown
sugar
dark
fruit
and
cinnamon
aromas
taste
is
much
the
same
with
a
cinnamon
flavor
that
lingers
on
the
finish
there
is
a
mild
amount
of
spice
bitterness
on
the
palate
with
each
sip
this
beer
has
a
lower
level
of
carbonation
with
a
slightly
crisp
and
medium
bodied
mouthfeel
overall
this
is
a
good
beer
that
is
tasty
but
has
a
better
smell
in
my
opinion
o
overall
a
really
solid
beer
that
blends
together
a
variety
of
flavors
really
well
this
good
blend
of
flavor
that
lets
everything
shine
without
overpowering
anything
else
is
what
makes
the
best
tracks
standout
feel
is
thin
but
not
boozy
and
low
carbonation
pretty
good
overly
cinnamon
and
needs
more
body
o
definitely
a
very
well
done
variation
of
the
cuvee
de
tomme
and
was
very
glad
to
have
tried
it
pours
a
dark
brown
with
a
thin
offwhite
head
smell
is
really
nice
a
great
mix
of
vanilla
from
the
bourbon
cinnamon
and
sweetness
a
bit
like
a
cookie
flavor
is
heavily
cinnamon
up
front
and
finishes
a
little
sweet
and
chocolatey
im
not
getting
much
from
the
chiles
here
disappointingly
mouthfeel
is
mediumfull
bodied
with
nice
carbonation
this
is
a
tasty
very
creative
beer
i
wish
it
was
a
little
more
chileforward
but
i
cant
complain
well
done
and
tasty
the
beer
is
a
similar
color
to
the
base
beer
with
more
head
and
longer
retention
thats
what
she
said
the
aroma
brings
cinnamon
perhaps
nutmeg
oak
booze
the
flavor
is
quite
nice
and
a
noticeable
improvement
over
the
base
beer
well
balanced
and
silky
smooth
on
the
palate
lingering
malt
with
a
bouquet
of
spices
tasty
beer
an
outstanding
achievement
curious
to
see
how
this
one
ages
but
its
so
delicious
hanging
on
to
it
would
prove
to
be
a
challenge
overall
very
good
cant
say
ive
had
anything
like
this
before
another
great
addition
to
an
excellent
series
im
interested
to
see
what
this
turns
into
when
the
box
set
is
released

a
strong

beer
overall
a
good
quad
but
unfortunately
the
one
i
got
may
have
been
a
little
past
its
prime
ill
grab
a
fresher
one
if
i
ever
see
it
again
overall
it
is
a
good
beer
but
falls
short
of
the
expectations
i
have
for
a
quad
lacks
complexity
and
depth
of
flavor
i
expect
no
flaws
but
falls
short
of
what
a
quad
can
be
overall
i
found
this
a
very
nice
very
tasty
quad
o
good
flavor
enjoyed
during
an
afternoon
thunderstorm
the
taste
is
wonderfully
roasted
sweet
maltiness
with
belgian
sugar
brown
sugar
and
or
molasses
in
there
to
sweeten
it
even
more
a
toasty
biscuit
feel
too
mild
and
low
hop
finish
the
alcohol
cannot
be
tasted
but
it
certainly
gets
into
my
head
drink
slowly
and
enjoy
o
really
nice
ale
from
great
brewers
pretty
things
has
put
out
another
winner
o
this
is
an
excellent
example
of
an
american
produced
quad
fruity
and
rich
this
beer
is
a
great
after
dinner
sipper
pretty
things
hits
a
home
run
with
baby
tree
if
youre
a
fan
of
dark
belgian
or
trappist
beers
this
is
definitely
worth
picking
up
o
nice
beer
it
doesnt
stack
up
with
the
best
but
i
certainly
wouldnt
turn
one
down
o
advertised
as
a
spring
beer
it
is
very
light
for
a
quadruple
ok
time
for
a
quad
and
it
pours
a
chestnut
hue
with
the
creamiest
three
finger
head
and
lacing
everywherethe
smell
is
brown
sugarsweet
plums
and
candi
sugarthe
mouthfeel
is
full
bodied
but
a
touch
syrupy
roasted
caramelbrown
sugardark
plums
and
finished
with
a
candi
sugar
sweetness
and
overall
for
me
its
just
too
sweet
for
a
proper
abbey
ale
instead
of
tasting
like
liquid
bread
it
comes
across
more
of
liquid
xmas
pudding
and
not
my
sort
of
quad
cheers
pours
a
clear
medium
brown
with
almost
no
head
thinnest
of
light
tan
collars
aroma
is
of
toffee
medium
malt
sweetness
and
a
healthy
indistinct
nuttyfruit
taste
is
deep
fruit
medium
malt
and
woodynuttiness
kinda
thin
body
with
medium
to
low
carbonation
this
was
a
good
quad
for
sure
im
really
liking
all
that
ive
tried
from
pretty
things
o
a
fantastic
quad
i
just
had
st
bernadus
abt
12
last
night
and
baby
tree
is
comparable
and
worthy
of
being
mentioned
in
the
same
sentence
admittedly
it
is
not
as
quintessential
as
st
bernardus
abt
12
but
it
is
more
approachable
certainly
worthy
of
another
go
around
in
the
future
a
well
done
beer
overall
pretty
solid
and
enjoyable
quad
for
a
fall
boston
evening
overall
this
is
a
pretty
good
representation
of
the
style
definitely
a
tasty
brew
i
recommend
that
you
give
it
a
shot
if
you
come
across
it
overall
good
quad
but
there
are
some
better
ones
out
there
could
definitely
use
some
tweaking
would
be
interesting
if
they
changed
up
the
brew
slightly
batch
after
batch
regardless
not
bad
but
for
the
money
there
are
better
options
salud
so
yeah
imagine
a
really
thick
super
maltforward
quad
without
much
of
a
spicy
belgian
yeast
presence
to
balance
out
the
sweetness
and
in
place
of
that
discern
belgian
yeast
you
get
tart
juicy
plums
yep
its
something
else
but
not
the
kind
of
something
else
im
entirely
interesting
in
getting
acquainted
with
overall
a
tasty
brew
sort
of
a
run
of
the
mill
quad
but
i
enjoyed
it
all
in
all
this
is
solid
its
no
trappist
quad
but
particularly
as
it
warms
this
has
some
nice
flavor
and
body
i
may
not
buy
another
bottle
online
but
id
definately
drink
it
again
o
this
quad
can
easily
hang
with
the
big
boys
imo
highly
recommended
especially
if
you
like
a
pronounced
sweetness
overall
quite
nice
this
isnt
the
best
batch
ive
ever
had
and
i
wish
i
recorded
the
batch
but
oh
well
i
have
another
few
bottles
waiting
review
in
my
cellar
so
when
i
crack
those
ill
note
the
batch
and
rereview
if
i
feel
i
should
o
this
beer
is
about
16
months
old
now
and
dont
know
if
it
was
intent
to
be
stored
but
i
enjoyed
it
and
for
3
00
you
cant
go
wrong
not
my
favorite
beer
by
pretty
things
but
its
good
and
worth
a
try
if
have
have
never
had
the
beer
or
the
style
o
a
nice
little
american
quad
with
a
big
focus
on
dark
fruits
and
nuttiness
certainly
not
the
most
complex
quad
ive
had
but
its
nice
not
a
bad
deal
for
under
7
for
a
bomber
im
guessing
its
a
belgian
strong
or
quad
but
i
wouldnt
be
surprised
if
it
were
a
barlewine
with
belgian
yeast
the
reveal
is
a
pretty
things
baby
tree
quadruple
im
thinking
that
is
another
want
off
my
list
o
a
delicious
quad
true
to
form
with
a
pleasant
flavor
profile
o
just
a
simple
nicetasting
quad
could
have
used
a
little
more
complexity
but
its
good
enough
to
get
again
it
just
wouldnt
be
at
the
top
of
my
list
o
its
good
but
doesnt
stand
out
in
this
style
would
have
benefited
from
the
dried
plums
they
stopped
adding
about
a
month
before
this
came
out
3
overall
good
and
worth
a
try
overall
its
an
above
average
quad
and
picking
it
up
for
5
bucks
i
hoped
it
was
old
since
1year
old
quad
are
tasty
wish
it
was
brewed
with
plums
it
would
have
added
that
extra
layer
of
complexity
pours
a
hazy
brown
with
a
foamy
khaki
head
that
settles
to
a
film
on
top
of
the
beer
small
dots
of
lace
form
around
the
glass
on
the
drink
down
smell
is
of
malt
dark
fruits
and
brown
sugar
taste
is
much
the
same
with
a
mild
spice
bitterness
on
the
palate
with
each
sip
this
beer
has
a
good
level
of
carbonation
with
a
crisp
mouthfeel
overall
this
is
a
pretty
good
beer
but
i
think
this
one
smells
better
than
it
tastes
o
well
done
refined
quad
here
i
like
that
it
had
the
right
amount
of
sweetness
dark
fruits
that
balance
wonderfully
o
this
was
an
interesting
quad
that
definitely
wasnt
like
your
typical
quad
this
definitely
had
a
lot
more
fruitiness
going
on
which
i
liked
but
it
just
reminded
me
a
little
bit
too
much
of
bubble
gum
i
enjoyed
drinking
it
and
recommend
trying
it
out
just
dont
expect
it
to
be
nearly
as
good
as
some
of
those
belgian
quads
definitely
an
interesting
and
unique
try
although
baby
tree
delves
further
into
authentic
belgian
taste
and
texture
than
do
the
more
timid
and
more
usual
american
attempts
it
comes
closer
to
tricking
me
into
believing
the
true
character
of
belgium
but
its
creamy
carbonation
gives
it
away
a
more
sprite
and
zesty
tactile
notion
here
would
have
really
sealed
it
for
me
o
very
tasty
brew
darkfruit
sprinkled
with
dry
coca
powder
had
a
bit
of
alcohol
bite
to
it
another
good
brew
from
pretty
things
o
pretty
decent
quad
very
dark
fruitforward
doesnt
seem
to
be
a
huge
amount
of
belgian
spice
influence
didnt
get
any
cloves
pepper
or
anything
just
a
sweet
fruity
and
mellow
beer
shame
about
the
apparent
oxidization
didnt
expect
a
9
quad
to
be
going
downhill
after
only
2
years
overall
45
pretty
things
has
a
good
beer
here
in
baby
tree
though
i
wouldnt
say
its
on
a
par
with
their
other
creations
still
it
is
a
tasty
fairly
drinkable
belgianstyle
quadruple
ale
that
really
hides
its
alcohol
presence
well
and
is
loaded
with
good
dark
fruit
flavors
worth
a
try
the
beer
pours
a
dark
brown
fruity
color
with
some
nice
ambering
that
reminds
me
of
raisins
the
head
is
very
compact
with
nice
little
white
cream
head
and
some
excellent
carbonation
running
up
the
sides
lacing
is
a
dribbling
sheet
of
white
on
the
edges
of
the
glass
leaving
behind
slight
tendrils
to
suggest
its
passing
the
beer
smells
sweet
with
dark
candy
sugars
and
dark
fruit
notes
like
raisin
the
malt
profile
in
the
nose
is
sweet
and
the
yeast
is
slightly
souring
and
pearlike
but
nicely
belgian
and
definitely
influenced
by
the
trappist
beers
there
is
a
great
syrupy
sweet
tinge
to
the
nose
which
suggests
a
big
sweet
belgian
body
there
is
also
a
sweet
alcohol
smell
lingering
beneath
everything
else
in
the
smell
and
suggesting
the
beers
9
the
beer
tastes
wonderfully
complex
with
an
interesting
splash
of
pearlike
esters
in
the
initial
sip
rounded
with
dark
fruits
and
the
sweet
malt
blanket
that
gives
the
beer
a
creamy
feel
the
pear
flavor
actually
continues
into
the
aftertaste
after
a
slight
lull
and
gives
the
mouth
a
slight
pucker
when
mixed
with
the
hops
bitters
at
the
end
of
the
sip
the
beer
is
a
little
cloying
on
the
mouth
with
the
sweets
the
hops
are
surprisingly
there
in
the
flavor
with
a
nice
dry
bittering
in
the
mouth
and
some
slight
earthy
spice
in
the
middle
of
the
taste
the
mouth
is
left
slightly
wet
on
the
sides
with
saliva
after
the
beer
has
passed
but
the
roof
and
tongue
of
the
mouth
are
quite
dry
overall
this
is
an
interesting
take
on
the
quad
style
but
im
not
sure
i
like
the
bittering
that
they
did
to
the
style
i
see
what
they
were
going
for
in
and
american
interpretation
of
the
quad
but
i
wasnt
really
blown
away
by
the
interpretation
pretty
things
is
an
awesome
brewery
i
love
what
they
do
but
this
one
just
didnt
do
it
for
me
the
beer
is
an
average
quad
overall
o
decent
the
beer
is
fairly
hazy
and
chestnut
brown
with
a
small
tan
head
that
leaves
sparse
lacing
the
aroma
malt
raisins
plums
a
touch
of
yeast
the
flavor
is
quite
good
much
better
tan
expected
a
fine
example
of
the
style
not
on
the
level
with
the
greats
of
the
style
but
a
solid
brew
nonetheless
d
this
is
not
a
style
that
always
ranks
high
on
the
drinkability
scale
but
this
beer
definitely
does

this
was

o
i
cant
give
too
bad
a
review
but
i
also
like
quads
and
bsdas
and
this
was
a
good
beer
so
i
am
glad
i
bought
it
but
it
does
not
displace

other
favorite
good
quads

be
darker

and
maltier
for
me
with

is
an
amazing
american
belgian
quad
of
flavor
that
is
so
dangerously
drinkable
the
flavor
is
so
complex
and
enjoyable
that
i
cant
say
enough
about
it

for
the

when
you

i
got
a

which
was

overall
not

but
not
my
favorite
for
the
style
then
again
i
dont
usually
seek
out
quads
so
what
do
i
know
i
like
the
way
the
malt
and
yeast
bring
forward
some
toast
and
slightly
dried
fruit
flavors
together
with
a
pineherbal
hop
flavor
there
is
a

with
some
mild
sugar
and
alcohol
in
the
background
with
spice
and
other
hop
flavors
appearing
midtaste
i
like
the
flavor
and
it
is
pretty
drinkable
for
the
strengthnot
the
best
quad
i
ever
tried
but
certainly
high
in
drinkabilitywelll
worth
trying
o
a
solid
quad
that
i
am
very
happy
the
i
got
to
try
i
have
not
had
too
many
american
quads
but
right
now
this
is
my
favorite
this
is
only
my
second
beer
from
pretty
things
and
cant
wait
to
try
o
i
cant
help
but
want
to
keep
smelling
this
beer
and
it
tastes
fantastic
pretty
things
is
quickly
becoming
one
of
my
favorite
east
coast
breweries
a
very
nice
sipper
comes
in
a
beautiful
looking
bottle
pours
very
nicely
with
a
very
reflective
in
the
light
deep
shade
of
mahogany
smells
and
tastes
wonderful
with
a
nice
even
balance
of
fruits
and
nuts
a
great
beer
by
pretty
things
othis
is
pretty
impressive
for
an
american
quad
the
flavors
are
all
pretty
decent
and
its
extremely
drinkable
it
does
become
less
and
less
complex
though
not
any
less
enjoyable
o
an
intriguing
engaging
beer
and
probably
the
best
example
of
the
style
made
in
america
that
ive
ever
tasted
highly
recommended
would
drink
again
poured
ontap
and
served
in
a

the

vibrant

dense

original
review
on
10112010
do
more
than
the
sum
of
its
parts
this
quadrupel
is
understated
from
start
to
finish
but
still
manages
to
capture
the
essence
of
the
style
the
smell
overprepares
the
palate
perhaps
coming
across
as
traditional
with
plenty
of
fruit
flavors
are
nuanced
but
the
most
interesting
elements
are
those
that
are
buried
under
a
layer
of
traditional
fruit
and
malt
and
not
normally
associated
with
the
quad
sensory
profile
spice
that
is
herbal
and
peppery
o
a
great
take
on
a
belgian
quad
not
the
most
complex
quad
available
but
very
solid
great
flavor
and
drinkability
amazing
artwork
o
a
fantastic
and
pretty
easydrinking
quadrupel
that
has
confirmed
to
me
that
i
love
this
style
worth
checking
out
certainly
for
the
brewerys
sake
and
for
the
bottle
artwork
while
its
not
the
most
complex
quad
this
side
of
the
atlantic
its
certainly
quite
tasty
this
belgian
quad
appears
a
fruity
raisin
brown
and
smells
like
a
mild
yeasty
belgian
ale
with
a
hint
of
the
dried
plums
the
name
quadruple
to
me
is
a
bit
bold
this
is
a
beer
which
hides
its
alcohol
well
and
comes
off
as
a
tripel
or
double
the
beer
is
full
bodied
with
a
very
delicate
mouthfeel
which
blends
amazingly
with
the
dried
plum
flavor
baby
tree
wont
blow
you
away
with
intense
hoppy
or
yeasty
flavors
but
to
me
is
a
well
balanced
and
enjoyable
fruity
belgian
that
i
could
recommend
to
anyone
quite
enjoyable
though
better
with
food
as
it
lacks
the
contemplative
qualities
i
seek
from
a
quad
o
quality
beer
though
a
bit
sweet
for
me
the
end
of
the
bottle
gets
a
bit
cloying
since
this
is
old
enough
that
there
have
been
plenty
of
batches
since
this
particular
batch
6
i
may
just
have
to
revisit
this
down
the
road
to
see
how
it
has
progressed
with
the
dried
plums
no
longer
being
put
in
o
this
brew
was
definitely
a
solid
quad
and
was
glad
to
have
another
good
beer
from
pretty
things
this
beer
isnt
for
everyone
and
it
doesnt
have
the
depth
of
other
quads
however
it
has
an
interesting
alcohol
signature
its
worth
drinking
on
tap
with
cheese
foods
o
a
bit
on
the
sweet
side
but
i
was
in
a
sweet
mood
i
thought
this
was
a
good
beer
that
is
super
easy
to
drink
and
very
smooth
this
was
sweet
fruity
spicy
and
a
little
boozy
i
guess
it
would
get
better
with
time
it
was
good
fresh
i
dont
think
this
counts
as
a
quad
but
i
think
i
could
try
it
again
as
with
most
beers
of
this
type
when
young
it
seems
like
it
could
use
a
bit
more
complexity
westvleteren
12
definitely
has
this
problem
but
this
one
actually
seems
to
work
a
little
better
at
this
young
stage
than
many
of
them
it
has
a
bit
more
complexity
though
i
get
the
feeling
that
a
bit
more
edge
will
soften
some
of
the
fruitiness
out
and
allow
other
notes
to
come
forward
while
likely
boosting
the
complexity
a
bit
someday
american
brewers
will
learn
to
recreate
the
depth
and
complexity
of
belgian
quadrupels
but
today
is
not
that
day
baby
tree
is
just
a
little
too
thin
for
my
tastes
glad
i
got
to
try
it
but
wont
seek
it
out
again
b
o
i
really
dig
this
stuff
its
not
what
i
expected
but
i
think
that
that
is
a
strength
i
wont
deny
that
i
enjoy
the
bananabomb
quads
that
exist
out
there
but
this
one
took
me
off
guard
a
bit
and
made
me
think
and
work
a
little
harder
to
get
and
sometimes
you
need
that
beer
that
pushes
you
a
little
really
tasty
stuff
and
pretty
things
continues
to
rightfully
hurt
my
heart
a
little
bit
with
this
one
as
they
arent
distributed
in
maine
that
being
said
this
is
a
good
effort
and
is
definitely
worth
trying
m
creamy
and
highly
drinkable
for
abv
has
an
aged
quality
to
it
overall
this
is
a
must
try
if
you
ask
me
very
unique
beer
that
doesnt
stray
away
from
still
tasting
like
a
beer
overall
a
very
nice
american
quad
this
is
one
of
the
more
drinkable
quads
i
have
had
it
is
lighter
in
body
than
others
of
the
style
with
plenty
of
satisfying
carbonation
its
an
interesting
quad
likeable
worth
a
try
sapsuckers
of
huntington
pours
the
baby
tree
quadrupel
in
a
footed
ale
glass
this
beer
has
a
beautiful
deep
reddish
hue
and
white
head
the
aromas
of
raisin
plum
and
ripe
apples
are
very
distinctive
on
the
nose
the
first
taste
surprises
you
with
the
tartness
that
settles
into
flavors
of
green
apples
raisins
and
plums
an
excellant
beer
that
went
surprisingly
well
with
my
almondcrusted
chatham
cod
o
pretty
good
quad
definitely
a
sipper
another
solid
beer
from
pretty
things
i
was
served
this
blind
and
had
no
idea
it
was
meant
to
be
a
quad
now
i
recognise
quad
as
probably
the
hardest
style
to
brew
well
but
i
think
theres
been
a
big
failure
here
even
to
create
a
fauxquad
character
it
feels
like
theres
substitute
ingredients
no
interesting
flavours
and
an
overall
distasteful
sensation
disappointing
not
a
bad
beer
but
i
just
wasnt
impressed
with
it
after
comparing
it
with
other
quads
that
ive
had
the
palate
opens
big
fruity
and
mildly
sweet
with
a
blend
of
cocoa
dark
caramel
and
toffee
theres
quite
a
bit
of
fruit
character
as
well
with
plums
and
raisins
cocoa
dust
is
apparent
on
the
midpalate
as
it
warms
up
the
perceived
sweetness
increases
mostly
as
a
bigger
body
however
the
spices
here
are
pretty
excellent
tempering
the
sweetness
in
a
good
way
with
clove
and
pepper
being
very
nice
a
little
bit
of
dry
leafy
hop
bitterness
is
present
on
the
finish
while
medium
in
body
this
beer
has
enough
grainy
bitterness
and
spices
to
cut
the
sweetness
carbonation
is
moderate
and
there
isnt
much
i
can
complain
about
with
this
beer
very
good
especially
at
this
age
which
is
the
only
age
ive
had
this
beer
o
i
am
glad
i
had
this
if
nothing
else
to
confirm
my
notions
that
quads
should
be
left
to
the
belgians
the
yeast
didnt
incorporate
into
the
fruits
and
the
whole
thing
was
a
bit
muddled
o
the
most
consistent
quality
of
this
beer
is
its
sweetness
but
its
such
a
pleasant
sweetness
solid
body
and
mouthfeel
not
overly
bubbly
a
strong
american
version
of
a
belgian
quad
i
dig
overall
im
exceedingly
disappointed
with
this
pretty
things
have
done
some
interesting
beers
in
the
past
but
this
is
pretty
insipid
and
an
extremely
average
attempt
at
a
quad
that
gives
the
style
a
bad
name
d
not
a
bad
example
of
the
style
though
it
is
lacking
the
deep
complexity
of
some
others
the
dark
sugar
is
really
dominant
here
and
while
there
is
some
spicy
yeast
character
i
would
have
liked
to
see
more
dark
fruit
and
perhaps
a
dryer
finish
o
this
is
my
first
offering
from
pretty
things
and
only
one
of
a
small
handful
of
quads
from
the
states
ive
enjoyed
o
a
nice
belgian
style
quad
one
that
i
will
try
again
overall
i
really
love
quads
but
this
one
departs
from
the
style
in
a
few
ways
that
make
me
not
love
it
still
tasty
but
more
in
a
spiced
bsda
way
with
so
many
quality
quads
available
theres
no
need
to
pick
this
one
up
again
22
ounce
bottle
into
chalice
batch
3
bottled
oct
2009
pours
slightly
cloudy
reddish
brown
color
with
a
nice
2
finger
dense
khaki
head
with
great
retention
that
reduces
to
a
thick
cap
that
lasts
forever
some
awesome
thick
lacing
clinging
to
the
glass
as
well
aromas
of
big
caramel
toasted
malt
bread
molasses
plums
light
chocolate
and
spices
nice
aromas
but
weaker
than
i
wanted
them
to
be
taste
of
big
caramel
molasses
toasted
malt
bread
chocolate
nuttiness
plum
other
fruits
pepper
and
yeast
spices
lingering
notes
of
toasted
malt
caramel
molasses
and
dark
fruits
on
the
finish
nice
balance
of
flavors
medium
carbonation
and
body
with
a
very
nice
and
creamy
mouthfeel
that
drinks
smoothly
no
alcohol
noticed
other
than
a
slight
warming
after
the
finish
overall
this
is
a
very
impressive
and
excellent
belgianstyle
quad
2
years
have
been
kind
to
this
beer
fairly
good
flavor
profile
just
wish
they
had
dialed
the
sweetness
back
a
bit
11
oz
of
it
was
a
solid
beer
but
that
was
around
the
absolute
max
i
could
take
of
this
before
it
became
too
cloying
a
good
one
to
cellar
and
drink
with
friends
overall
a
slow
siping
beer
that
goes
well
with
sitting
in
front
of
a
fireplace
on
a
cold
night
easy
to
consume
the
whole
bottle
by
yourself
perhaps
better
on
tap
somewhere
but
not
from
this
bottle
pours
a
dark
orangey
red
with
some
chestnut
highlights
a
cream
coloured
head
with
great
retention
and
some
lace
nose
has
some
dark
fruits
a
bit
of
apple
some
caramel
and
sugary
notes
with
a
bit
of
candy
taste
has
more
dark
fruits
a
green
apple
notes
a
touch
metallic
some
caramelly
malts
and
some
grape
and
berry
notes
full
body
but
not
too
heavy
creamy
feel
with
a
modest
low
carbonation
a
touch
of
alcohol
comes
through
after
the
sip
is
finished
quite
a
nice
american
take
on
the
style
and
something
easily
revisitable
d
not
one
i
would
want
to
drink
regularly
but
one
id
like
to
keep
in
the
cellar
to
have
on
hand
for
when
i
want
one
pours
a
clean
deep
amber
to
brown
in
color
with
a
tan
head
in
the
aroma
ripe
dark
fruits
and
sugary
plums
in
the
taste
sweet
dark
fruit
licorice
plums
and
just
a
note
of
alcohol
a
smooth
and
medium
bodied
mouthfeel
with
a
semi
dry
fruit
and
licorice
in
the
aftertaste
hides
the
abv
nice
presence
of
dark
fruit
and
nice
notes
of
licorice
drink
it
was
a
nice
smooth
quad
for
9
like
i
said
light
all
around
but
still
flavorful
and
balanced
pretty
things
does
some
good
beers
thanks
again
for
this
one
matt

a
bomber
o
this
is
a
well
made
easy
to
drink
and
very
focused
beer
extremely
drinkable
overall
this
is
a
rich
malty
brew
with
welllayered
flavors
of
caramel
bread
dried
figs
and
sugars
among
others
could
use
additional
complexity
but
cant
really
recommend
much
other
remove
for
complexity
delicious
and
dangerously
drinkable
dark
amber
hue
in
my
snifter
off
white
head
with
ok
retention
reduces
to
a
small
cap
scent
is
dark
fruit
heavy
plum
and
raisen
burnt
sugar
yeast
taste
is
a
bit
more
muted
but
sweet
light
bodied
and
well
carbonated
i
find
it
hard
to
fathom
that
9
abv
can
be
this
well
hidden
but
it
is
fuller
body
higher
carbonation
sticky
and
coating
on
the
tongue
tasty
quad
i
enjoyed
the
addition
of
plums
and
the
higher
abv
wasnt
overbearing
at
all
overall
one
of
the
more
lackluster
offerings
ive
had
from
pretty
things
the
flavors
never
really
hit
it
for
me
and
the
carbonation
was
killer
its
a
nice
try
for
the
american
take
on
the
style
but
there
are
better
examples
out
there
im
missing
the
desired
complexity
of
the
style
not
as
interesting
as
other
pt
beers
makes
me
think
of
some
of
the
dark
heavy
stone
beers
without
the
hop
overdose
in
some
ways
its
an
improvement
over
the
heavy
syrupy
quads
however
odoverall
considering
this
is
not
my
favorite
style
i
still
think
this
is
a
pretty
good
representation
of
such
style
pretty
things
did
not
strike
out
here
rich
is
a
good
word
to
describe
this
brew
pretty
things
is
a
solid
brewery
poured
into
a
chalice
a
rich
burgundy
infused
russet
with
a
thinner
tannish
colored
head
atop
funk
and
more
funk
overtop
of
dark
fruit
in
the
nosemaybe
the
most
funk
i
have
come
across
in
a
quad
cakey
with
dark
fruit
flavors
the
at
turn
into
quite
a
funky
finishiam
not
a
fan
of
funk
so
it
kinda
turned
me
off
a
little
a
well
made
beer
but
i
think
the
funk
is
heavy
handed
for
the
style
kind
of
disappointing
actually
this
is
the
second
beer
ive
tried
from
pt
and
both
have
only
been
decent
meh
o
this
one
really
blew
me
away
maybe
its
because
the
last
few
quads
ive
tried
have
been
duds
but
i
thought
this
was
fantastic
overall
a
decent
quad
but
not
overly
notable
o
quite
a
drinkable
quad
not
the
most
complex
example
of
the
style
but
tasty
and
approachable
a
nice
quad
with
good
flavors
gets
a
bit
syrupy
on
the
finish
which
holds
me
back
from
completely
loving
this
beer
body
is
mediumfull
with
mediumlow
soft
carbonation
goes
down
easily
and
is
very
drinkable
o
this
beer
was
a
disappointment
i
would
not
seek
this
out
again
the
nose
was
just
not
that
great
and
the
taste
was
forgettable
many
american
brewers
see
belgian
ales
much
like
their
own
but
with
added
yeastthats
entirely
missing
the
point
when
it
comes
to
belgian
ales
it
is
a
another
country
a
story
of
different
worlds
as
much
as
different
beers
quads
are
not
just
darker
more
potent
beers
they
are
intricate
sensual
relaxing
tipples
pretty
things
obviously
understood
that
well
this
is
one
of
few
americanborn
examples
to
get
it
right
and
thats
not
easy
to
do
o
this
is
a
decent
brew
but
not
a
standout
amongst
the
style
i
like
my
quads
to
have
stronger
more
pronounced
flavors
but
it
might
be
the
easiest
drinking
quad
around
the
dried
plums
lend
a
pleasant
fruity
punch
to
the
lightly
spicy
nose
without
overwhelming
it
the
plum
flavor
is
pretty
strong
but
not
overly
sweet
the
malt
profile
itself
seems
to
be
rather
restrained
in
the
sweetness
department
too
tasty
though
with
a
good
balance
of
spicy
sweet
and
bitter
qualities
good
beginner
quad
perhaps
goes
down
a
lot
easier
than
your
average
9
brew
a
hint
of
funk
now
and
then
has
me
wondering
if
theres
brett
in
this
stuff
not
terribly
complex
but
certainly
worth
a
try
pours
a
dark
brown
with
hints
of
purple
and
red
when
held
up
to
light
tiny
white
head
that
disappears
quickly
scent
is
heavy
with
dark
fruit
and
caramel
malt
taste
is
just
as
it
smells
initially
i
get
prunes
and
raisins
followed
by
plums
and
hints
of
brown
sugar
and
caramel
malt
no
alcohol
flavors
detected
mouthfeel
is
a
bit
on
the
light
watered
down
side
for
a
quad
highly
drinkable
though
overall
this
is
by
far
not
the
best
example
of
this
style
but
it
is
a
very
tasty
and
drinkable
beer
definitely
a
complex
and
enjoyable
beer
like
i
said
before
it
is
more
dominated
my
the
spice
than
dark
fruits
or
other
flavors
id
rather
huff
jenkum
then
drink
this
again
middling
matched
up
against
any
standard
belgian
quad
this
doesnt
really
pass
muster
as
an
inventive
take
on
a
seminal
beer
style
which
is
really
pretty
things
m
o
this
is
a
solid
effort
that
im
happy
to
see
on
tap
around
town
treated
as
an
american
quad
this
is
great
to
outstanding
i
am
very
glad
that
pretty
things
distribution
is
making
its
way
to
california
ive
liked
a
lot
of
the
beers
ive
had
by
them
but
this
one
was
somewhat
of
a
let
down
i
wouldnt
mind
giving
it
another
shot
sometime
but
it
just
wasnt
for
me
notes
i
absolutely
love
what
pretty
things
is
doing
but
this
might
be
my
least
favorite
beer
by
them
so
far
thats
more
of
a
compliment
than
anything
else
as
this
is
not
a
bad
beer
just
not
really
what
i
was
looking
for
in
a
quad
poured
from
a
brown
22oz
bottle
has
a
dark
brown
color
with
a
1
inch
head
good
carbonation
smell
is
very
fruity
plums
maybe
banana
yeast
taste
is
also
very
good
plum
cherry
banana
some
alcohol
is
present
but
well
hidden
for
the
most
part
feels
full
bodied
in
the
mouth
and
overall
i
would
highly
recomend
this
beer
very
one
dimensional
almost
all
dried
dark
fruit
taste
it
still
tastes
good
but
not
as
complex
as
others
of
its
style
jd
booze
is
well
hidden
its
abv
mask
is
the
only
aspect
of
this
beer
thats
on
par
with
the
big
boys
of
this
style
a
decent
beer
but
its
quite
far
from
being
special
aroma
is
everything
you
would
want
in
a
quad
rich
malty
backbone
hints
of
prunes
figs
earthy
tones
and
light
caramel
sweetness
that
is
balanced
nicely
against
a
tight
profile
of
light
spices
really
well
done
very
nice
full
feel
with
near
perfect
carbonation
is
exactly
what
i
was
looking
for
the
flavor
opens
up
with
loads
of
dark
fruits
and
brown
sugar
colliding
with
light
spices
and
a
smooth
even
flavor
that
hides
the
alcohol
and
smooths
the
palate
m
medium
body
light
carbonation
purplish
brown
body
on
this
beast
with
a
big
two
finger
head
that
settles
to
a
line
quickly
with
decent
lacing
the
nose
is
sweet
malts
caramel
plum
bread
and
crackers
taste
is
beautiful
plum
sweet
malts
and
caramel
very
very
sweet
carbonation
is
moderate
to
low
finish
is
nice
and
dry
overall
this
is
a
damn
fine
offering
from
pretty
things
i
would
probably
not
recommend
this
to
others
over
the
incredible
selection
of
local
favorites
and
imports
that
exist
at
my
fingertips
drinkability
nice
blend
of
complexities
and
drinkability
alcohol
is
very
sneaky
and
well
hidden
a
malty
treat
nice
stuff
o
one
of
the
better
american
quads
ive
had
thanks
to
brian
for
sharing
this
rarity
this
is
a
medium
bodied
brew
with
a
very
modest
level
of
carbonation
the
alcohol
is
present
and
fitting
for
the
listed
9
with
both
flavor
and
warming
factor
this
brew
seems
like
a
bit
of
a
jumbled
mess
that
never
really
came
together
and
blended
well
while
the
sweetness
hops
and
alcohol
are
balanced
well
the
flavors
and
aromas
seem
a
bit
off
it
isnt
a
bad
brew
by
any
stretch
but
it
also
isnt
something
i
think
i
would
return
to
again
if
given
other
options
the
label
states
this
brew
was
made
with
dried
plums
i
believe
there
are
other
examples
of
the
style
available
that
incorporate
more
plum
flavoring
without
actually
using
plums
in
the
brew
pours
a
dark
maroon
with
a
good
amount
of
white
frothy
head
looks
very
pretty
smells
plum
heavy
and
floral
tastes
a
bit
boozy
and
very
plum
heavy
fruity
but
a
bit
over
the
top
on
the
heavy
dark
fruits
thick
full
mouthfeel
but
very
well
carbonated
overall
i
really
like
this
beer
but
its
not
something
i
would
drink
often
beer
is
medium
in
body
and
has
a
mildly
metallic
flavor
to
it
some
nice
sweetness
up
front
and
an
overall
pleasing
experience
on
the
palate
the
initial
flavors
are
just
a
little
off
the
metallic
thing
in
the
beginning
prevents
this
beer
from
moving
up
in
the
listing
to
me
oh
well
still
a
decent
beer
o
this
has
to
be
the
blandest
quadrupel
ive
ever
had
maybe
its
too
cold
im
not
too
sure
even
flavorful
cold
beers
have
flavor
when
chilled
well
overall
a
nice
american
interpretation
of
the
belgian
quad
welcome
constructed
and
tasty
ive
yet
to
be
disappointed
with
the
beers
from
pretty
things
notes
first
offering
of
the
much
sought
after
pretty
things
in
this
region
that
i
get
my
lips
into
i
actually
was
not
hoping
for
nothing
out
of
the
envelope
so
this
one
did
not
disappoint
but
it
did
not
quite
make
a
dent
in
the
memory
either
all
shorts
of
decent
and
a
nice
take
on
a
quad
that
i
would
not
mind
having
again
in
fact
it
might
be
a
good
one
to
offer
socially
for
some
early
craft
aficionados
this
was
a
very
big
surprise
in
the
palate
and
this
is
one
of
the
easiest
drinking
quads
i
think
ive
ever
had
just
wonderful
this
beer
poured
out
as
a
nice
reddish
brown
color
the
head
was
fluffy
and
white
with
a
decent
lacing
the
smell
of
the
beer
is
sweet
and
had
some
nice
fruity
aromas
coming
off
of
it
the
taste
of
the
beer
is
nice
lots
of
brown
sugar
sweetness
with
some
plums
and
raisin
on
the
tongue
the
mouthfeel
is
light
and
slick
very
easy
to
drink
overall
i
enjoyed
the
beer
and
would
like
to
have
it
again
o
a
very
nice
american
quad
and
a
dangerous
sipper
at
9
abv
one
of
the
cleanest
american
big
beers
ive
had
that
offered
such
soft
fruity
flavors
with
authentic
belgian
malts
yeast
and
spiciness
well
done
overall
compares
well
to
the
best
belgian
quads
but
just
missing
a
little
something
that
they
have
it
drinks
easily
enough
and
i
certainly
wouldnt
mind
drinking
it
again
from
time
to
time
it
just
isnt
really
what
i
expect
from
a
wellmade
quad
o
this
is
a
pleasant
fruity
and
bready
quad
another
great
beer
from
the
folks
at
pretty
things
o
really
enjoyed
this
beer
thought
the
flavors
were
interesting
love
pretty
things
and
what
they
put
out
can
definitely
drink
quite
a
few
of
these
and
intend
to
get
more
if
it
wasnt
good
the
first
time
around
give
it
another
try
overall
a
fantastic
quad
all
the
flavors
are
subdued
but
recognizable
and
meld
very
well
together
would
love
to
try
this
one
with
about
two
years
on
it
sorry
for
the
verbosity
d
enjoyable
for
sure
we
had
a
batch
one
fresh
and
i
remember
liking
that
more
a
good
american
example
of
a
style
that
is
difficult
to
make
well
i
really
am
curious
as
to
the
yeast
selection
i
think
this
one
might
be
better
fresh
cheers
o
pretty
things
beers
continue
to
disappoint
me
this
just
didnt
have
manyany
of
the
characteristics
i
look
for
in
a
quad
o
standard
quad
that
i
would
love
to
try
again
hard
to
get
out
here
in
oregon
but
i
guess
that
means
i
will
just
have
to
start
trading
more
for
it
o
had
high
hopes
and
was
prety
dissappointed
i
will
revisit
possibly
after
aging
this
batch
and
trying
others
o
this
has
good
drinkability
its
easy
to
drink
and
it
has
a
nice
flavor
i
could
easily
put
a
few
of
these
back
even
though
its
9
abv
i
recommend
giving
this
a
try
d
pretty
drinkable
lots
of
flavor
and
more
of
a
sipping
beer
very
nicely
balanced
flavor
with
all
the
flavors
mixing
well
bit
of
alcohol
taste
but
it
fits
in
well
ofor
a
brew
of
9
0
its
incredibly
sessionable
i
could
easily
drink
these
by
the
pint
while
out
with
friends
the
baby
tree
picture
on
the
bottle
creeps
me
out
though
this
seems
like
a
very
different
take
on
the
quadrupel
not
to
say
that
ive
had
two
that
are
too
similar
the
smell
takes
on
more
of
the
yeast
with
hops
and
a
dry
sweetness
as
secondary
aromas
the
beer
has
a
nice
taste
to
it
again
more
of
a
dry
and
bittersweet
quad
with
a
that
bit
of
alcohol
peeking
through
the
rest
of
the
flavors
nice
take
on
the
style
o
not
a
bad
quad
overall
pretty
things
always
seem
to
put
out
legit
brews
o
i
really
enjoyed
this
drinkability
is
pretty
good
fairly
well
balanced
nice
depth
the
astringency
takes
away
from
it
slightly
but
overall
i
still
enjoyed
it
mouthfeel
is
medium
bodied
almost
oily
and
slick
low
carbonation
not
enough
for
the
style
pretty
warm
going
down
and
a
little
too
astringent
for
my
liking
thanks
russ
dan
interesting
take
on
the
quad
style
not
my
favorite
offering
from
pretty
things
but
better
than
may
others
which
are
too
hot
in
a
bottle
it
has
a
bit
of
metallic
flavor
and
there
is
a
syrupy
flavor
and
sweetness
that
is
a
bit
overpowering
ah
and
i
misjudged
this
didnt
last
nearly
as
long
as
i
had
intended
and
it
never
got
to
even
50f
its
been
quite
a
while
since
ive
had
a
quad
let
alone
a
good
one
bottle
poured
a
clear
medium
copper
color
ale
with
a
super
large
light
brown
head
with
great
retention
and
some
very
good
lacing
aroma
of
light
brown
sugar
notes
with
some
light
maple
syrup
notes
and
light
dry
fruits
taste
is
a
nice
mix
of
brown
sugar
and
light
dry
fruits
with
not
as
much
character
as
expected
body
is
below
average
for
style
with
great
carbonation
and
no
apparent
alcohol
i
must
admit
to
being
slightly
disappointed
by
this
one
with
thin
body
and
not
much
character
but
again
though
style
to
brew
considering
the
best
in
style
cheers
did
not
like
this
beer
too
much
imo
quads
should
be
way
more
sweetcomplex
and
yeasty
than
this
one
i
found
that
there
was
too
much
hop
presence
and
thats
not
what
i
look
for
in
this
style
another
very
solid
effort
from
pretty
things
i
remain
impressed
a
really
nice
example
of
the
style
and
an
all
around
enjoyable
and
well
crafted
brew
nice
to
see
american
breweries
putting
out
such
nice
examples
of
the
belgian
style
beers
these
days
i
would
love
to
have
this
again
as
far
a
quads
go
this
was
not
one
of
my
favorites
the
fruit
characteristic
is
there
but
light
and
it
is
a
bit
sweeter
than
i
like
enjoyable
beer
but
i
wont
buy
it
again
d
easy
enough
to
drink
the
plums
made
it
nice
but
could
have
been
more
complex
d
it
is
quite
drinkable
for
the
abv
it
is
a
tasty
beer
earthy
medium
body
that
is
very
sweet
with
a
soft
tart
presence
again
there
is
a
very
earthy
dirt
like
flavor
up
front
that
lingers
throughout
lots
of
estery
sweet
dark
fruit
notes
especially
plum
prune
raisin
tart
dark
cherries
and
other
dark
berries
slightly
cloying
but
there
is
a
decent
amount
of
tart
character
to
balance
this
slight
alochol
sweetness
but
no
warmth
in
the
finish
slightly
metallic
and
syrupy
with
subtle
hops
theres
just
a
bit
too
much
going
on
here
for
my
liking
and
i
find
it
way
too
sweet
drinkability
its
nice
an
interesting
brew
that
grows
on
you
as
easily
as
farmfresh
babies
in
a
tree
forgetting
style
and
simply
taking
it
for
what
it
is
i
find
it
to
be
an
enjoyable
beer
and
fairly
interesting
it
is
a
bit
bitter
but
i
dont
feel
thats
completely
out
of
place
would
it
work
better
if
it
was
a
bit
sweeter
most
likely
yes
if
it
didnt
follow
a
particular
style
would
it
work
id
also
say
yes
however
it
is
a
bit
less
drinkable
because
of
it
the
bitterness
of
the
hops
and
the
bitterness
of
the
dark
fruit
skins
combine
and
then
stick
in
the
mouth
it
almost
finishes
with
a
bit
of
a
licorice
note
but
then
again
i
have
to
ask
is
that
such
a
bad
thing
style
not
taken
into
account
maybe
not
youll
have
to
judge
this
one
for
yourself
botted
in
june
2010
batch
6
pours
a
ruby
brown
colour
with
very
thin
head
head
dissipates
fairly
quickly
smells
stongly
of
dark
fruit
must
me
the
plum
there
is
also
some
brown
sugar
with
a
mild
belgian
yeast
aroma
flavour
has
a
bit
of
tartness
to
it
but
quite
sweet
overall
thin
mouthfeel
for
the
style
d
a
really
easy
drinker
for
the
styleweight
d
again
theres
so
much
to
like
about
this
beer
but
the
flavor
makes
it
a
little
slower
to
drink
and
by
the
time
i
finished
the
22oz
bottle
i
didnt
want
another
straight
away
d
not
real
easy
drinking
kindof
astringent
and
dry
not
the
best
quad
ever
d
was
kind
of
hard
for
me
to
finish
the
bomber
didnt
really
care
for
it
that
much
this
bottle
is
quite
fresh
i
think
maybe
having
a
year
on
it
would
do
wonders
and
id
be
willing
to
try
it
again
sometime
especially
since
im
a
huge
plum
fan
d
a
real
easy
drinker
abv
is
not
noticeable
and
overall
tasty
quad
drinkability
other
than
the
marzipan
flavor
which
i
dont
particularly
care
for
i
like
everything
about
this
beer
a
pretty
decent
quad
though
i
find
the
bitterness
distracting
and
cant
help
but
think
that
something
mellower
would
let
the
plums
shine
more
cheers
eric
interesting
take
on
the
style
wouldnt
really
call
it
a
quad
though
toffee
toast
rich
caramel
malts
earth
nut
shells
walnutcocoa
molasses
hint
of
plum
which
comes
across
slightly
tart
really
long
lasting
bitterness
from
the
hops
bone
dry
finish
light
sweetness
but
left
feeling
that
to
showcase
the
plum
a
bit
more
less
bitterness
and
a
more
rounded
sweetness
would
help
still
i
enjoy
a
dry
complex
beer
so
this
is
still
pleasantly
drinkable
rated
it
based
on
quad
but
for
an
infected
quad
fairly
complex
perhaps
try
this
on
purpose
overall
this
is
quite
nice
and
a
solid
american
quad
offering
less
carbonated
that
the
traditional
belgian
examples
which
is
good
or
bad
depedning
on
your
preferences
nice
flavors
meld
well
together
and
make
for
a
very
pleasant
brew
22oz
bomber
this
one
pours
a
dark
caramel
brown
color
there
was
a
pretty
substantial
off
white
head
on
it
that
lingers
a
bit
and
leaves
some
lacing
nice
nose
but
a
little
light
for
a
quad
some
spices
up
front
of
which
clove
is
the
most
prevalent
some
sugary
caramel
and
some
dark
fruits
also
medium
bodied
which
seems
a
little
light
for
a
quad
taste
is
good
a
nice
little
bit
of
spice
to
the
start
a
bit
of
caramel
dark
fruits
but
a
very
minimal
sweetness
to
it
a
nice
enough
beer
but
not
quite
up
to
par
with
some
other
quads
overall
a
decent
beer
its
not
world
class
but
its
a
respectable
effort
i
would
give
it
a
try
but
wouldnt
seek
it
out
if
it
werent
available
to
me
cheers
the
flavor
is
along
the
same
lines
with
a
bit
of
booze
dark
fruits
pervade
along
with
a
bit
of
belgian
yeast
the
plums
are
apparent
but
not
overpowering
the
mouthfeel
is
a
big
of
a
big
dive
from
here
as
there
is
an
unpleasant
metallic
astringency
in
the
finish
it
drinks
well
enough
in
the
end
but
there
are
a
few
little
things
that
prevent
this
from
being
all
that
drinkable
mouthfeel
is
oddly
dry
which
a
quad
doesnt
wear
too
well
and
the
hops
are
over
the
top
let
the
yeast
and
complex
beliganisms
shine
i
feel
the
same
way
about
residual
sugars
leave
some
so
that
i
can
revel
in
the
yeastystrongquad
complexity
note
the
more
i
drink
this
the
more
i
like
it
really
comes
into
its
own
around
room
temperature
mouthfeel
has
a
medium
body
feel
with
a
nice
velvety
smoothness
overall
a
very
enjoyable
beer
and
a
unique
quad
d
this
was
a
mediocre
beer
but
it
could
have
been
much
better
if
it
was
aged
a
year
and
bottle
conditioned
clearly
an
american
attempt
at
a
belgian
style
with
strangely
high
hop
levels
the
alcohol
was
well
hidden
so
it
was
easy
to
drink
but
it
just
didnt
taste
right
not
worth
buying
again
the
taste
score
should
be
something
like
3
8
or
3
9
but
if
i
marked
it
3
5
the
weight
of
the
scoring
system
would
be
too
detrimental
to
the
overall
score
same
with
mouthfeel
which
should
be
a
3
7
or
so
to
compromise
i
gave
the
drinkability
a
3
5
when
otherwise
i
feel
4
0
would
be
appropriate
d
this
is
a
really
tasty
quad
im
glad
i
got
to
try
this
one
overall
it
is
a
decent
quad
i
like
the
nose
a
lot
but
the
taste
doesnt
follow
up
as
well
it
has
a
decent
drinkability
and
i
think
it
was
a
fine
choice
for
a
nice
fall
evening
bomber
of
above
average
yeasty
slightly
sweet
dark
belgium
it
has
a
drying
finish
with
a
hint
of
plum
and
the
finish
offsets
the
previous
sweetness
a
little
different
above
average
thicknesscaramel
both
in
looks
and
in
mouthfeel
good
drinkability
worth
seeking
out
yeasty
malty
aromas
overall
a
pretty
good
american
quad
an
interesting
take
i
really
like
how
pretty
things
puts
their
own
take
on
different
styles
and
makes
them
their
own
medium
bodied
mouthfeel
a
bit
of
chew
styleappropriate
carbonation
and
fairly
drinkable
this
is
the
second
pretty
things
extra
i
have
received
in
recent
weeks
and
ive
enjoyed
them
both
this
is
advertised
as
a
quad
with
dried
plums
and
the
plums
really
come
through
on
the
palate
along
with
raisins
brown
spices
and
light
brown
sugar
a
very
solid
effort
and
one
that
was
enjoyed
by
most
the
other
night
overall
i
dug
it
but
not
as
rich
as
i
hoped
dries
out
too
soon

thin

a

for

while
the
smell
consisted
of

molasses
and
was
very
faint
overall
taking
a
sip
of
baby

i
taste
malt
immediately
with
an
overall
richness
it
is
also
a
sweet
tasting
beer
but
has
a
bitter
finish
the
mouthfeel
on
this
quad
has
a
medium
body
with
good
carbonation
it
is
solid
drinkability
on
this
offering
from
pretty
things
is
better
than
i
had
expected
considering
the
style
although
it
has
a
9
abv
and
some
big
flavors
to
it
it
can
go
down
easily
sip
enjoy
overall
a
disappointment
for
me
too
bitter
and
hoppy
for
a
quad
and
nowhere
near
the
assertive
sweetness
i
look
for
not
a
bad
beer
but
not
a
good
example
of
the
style

4
poured
from

into
oerbier
tulip
pours
a
cloudy
dark
opaque
brown
quarter
inch
head
fades
to
sides
with
nice

not
a
lot
in
the
smell
some
fruit
a
decent
amount
of
hops
given
the
age
iron
and
belgian
yeast
taste
is
also
bitter
much
more
hoppy
then
i
would
guess
for
the
style
or
age
yeast
flavor
follows
some
candy
sugar
and
a
bit
of
roasted
malt
mouthfeel
is
well
carbonated
and
clean
but
i
would
like
a
quad
to
be
a
bit
heavier
none
of
the
flavors
really
mesh
up
in
this
beer
every
taste
is
fighting
to
be
in
front
i
find
myself
begrudgingly
going
back
to
this
so
based
on
flavor
alone
this
has
a
low
drinkability
d
i
love
quads
this
is
no
quad
so
disappointed
d
dangerous
for
9
its
light
bitterness
leaves
you
wanting
another
sip
before
you
know
it
the
glass
is
gone
and
its
time
for
another
superb
brew
from
pretty
things
baby
tree
is
another
solid
effort
from
pretty
things
quality
quadrupels
arent
easy
to
come
by
in
america
so
this
one
deserves
credit
for
doing
most
things
right
time
to
get
those
pillows
ready
the

beginning
to
work

number

big
big
frothy
off
white
light
brown
head
that
has
some
staying
power
dark
amber
body
color
with
lots
of
carbonation
pulsing
through
it
smells
of
solid
alcohol
and
belgian
yeast
not
much
malt
or
fruit
smell
considering
it
says
its
a
quad
with
dried
plums
overall
balance
of
the
flavor
is
good
with
a
strong
alcohol
finish
surprisingly
mild
malt
front
with
a
spicy
hop
finish
mild
bitterness
no
surprises
though
and
the
plum
flavor
is
hard
to
detect
maybe
some
caramel
in
the
middle
what
makes
this
quad
different
is
its
overall
lightness
and
delicate
flavors
this
is
not
a
heavy
quad
you
could
say
this
is
a
refreshing
quad
very
easy
going
and
not
flashy
but
satisfying
i
think
this
beer
is
one
of
those
cases
where
less
is
more
d
not
the
best
or
most
interesting
quad
i
have
had
but
its
alright
drinkability
is
ok
i
guess
i
was
expecting
a
little
more
than
i
got
out
of
this

nice
dry
and
sweet
finish
simple
but
with
character
this
one
will
do
well
in
any
season
feels
very
good
in
the
mouth
and
goes
down
smooth
not
a
chugging
beer
by
any
means
but
its
smooth
enough
where
that
9
could
get
you
in
trouble
pretty
quickly
the
beer
was
easy
to
drink
for
a
quad
but
a
22
ozs
was
enough
for
me
in
a
sitting
an
enjoyable
brew
i
will
be
drinking
more
of
d
really
good
d
tasty
goes
down
easily
not
too
filling
strong
kick
good
representation
of
style
this
is
a
good
stronger
belgianstyle
beer
that
is
worth
drinking
for
a
while
overall
this
beer
used
to
be
better
its
not
bad
but
nowhere
near
as
good
as
the
imported
ones
this
beer
has
become
one
of
my
least
favorite
of
pretty
things
overall
this
was
a
solid
and
wellcrafted
beer
but
it
was
too
muted
to
be
great
still
its
worth
a
shot
to
decide
for
yourself
d
very
drinkable
im
happy
to
have
tried
this
one
after
seeing
such
a
long
line
at
acbf
another
exercise
in
the
mastery
of
brewing
full
flavored
but
subtle
beer
by
pretty
things
in
my
review
of
saint
botolphs
town
i
mentioned
how
i
enjoyed
the
beer
for
all
of
its
english
brown
flavors
despite
many
of
them
not
normally
being
up
my
alley
baby
tree
is
exactly
up
my
alley
and
its
as
wellmade
as
botolphs
town
id
say
its
just
a
touch
below
beers
like
saint
bernardus
abt
12
and
rochefort
10
dthis
isnt
bad
lots
of
phenol
and
banana
in
both
the
nose
and
the
taste
but
the
plums
dont
seem
to
really
show
through
a
faint
bit
of
dark
fruit
towards
the
back
but
not
like
i
had
hoped
for
drinkability
its
a
very
tasty
beer
theres
no
doubt
about
that
and
its
really
easy
to
drink
and
entire
bottle
of
this
with
no
problem
after
the
first
glass
you
really
feel
the
9
d
the
quad
doesnt
feel
like
9
although
its
lush
flavor
should
be
a
dead
giveaway
another
strong
belgian
offering
from
pretty
things
d
i
anticipated
not
liking
baby
tree
because
i
usually
dont
like
dark
fruit
flavors
in
my
beers
however
this
one
surprised
me
taste
is
rich
and
sweet
but
still
its
not
too
dry
its
got
lots
of
raisins
and
dark
fruit
its
really
got
a
nice
rich
mouthfeel
very
tasty
and
drinkable
d
i
was
more
impressed
than
i
expected
to
be
really
great
beer
drinkability
a
nice
and
complex
beer
and
certainly
one
i
would
get
again
i
like
the
breadiness
and
fruit
there
are
other
quads
i
would
reach
for
first
however
i
would
still
reach
for
this
over
several
other
beers
across
styles
a
good
beer
in
a
style
with
several
excellent
brews
poured
this
straight
down
this
middle
of
my
stemmed
glass
just
as
the
bottle
told
me
to
pours
a
rich
dark
ruby
color
with
an
off
white
four
finger
monster
of
a
head
the
head
looks
really
nice
and
has
nice
retention
lots
of
sticky
lacing
im
actually
kind
of
having
trouble
picking
up
some
of
the
aromas
on
this
i
definitely
smell
the
dried
plumbs
and
other
dark
fruits
other
than
that
i
can
only
smell
a
trace
of
alcohol
and
aromas
that
can
only
be
explained
as
earthy
sweet
malts
and
the
dried
prunes
take
the
forefront
on
the
taste
of
this
one
warming
spices
such
as
cloves
coat
my
pallet
on
this
nice
dry
finish
hints
of
vanilla
really
a
lot
going
on
with
this
one
after
the
aroma
i
was
a
little
afraid
this
would
be
a
hot
boozy
mess
however
it
has
a
nice
silky
mouth
feel
with
subtle
tingling
carbonation
not
heat
and
a
nice
comforting
beer
to
cap
the
night
off
dquite
nice
and
while
a
solid
quad
not
totally
typical
nice
flavours
meld
well
and
make
for
a
very
pleasant
brew

are
a

out

had

experience
at

couple
months
ago
with
its
strong
whiskeylike
character
alcohol
presence
and
full
body
this
beer
drinks
extremely
slowly
d
really
nice
quad
with
some
distinctive

going

sets
it
apart
from
most
others

impedes

the

a

d
its
very
drinkable
and
the
alcohol
is
very
well
hidden
probably
not
westy

but
no
doubt
worth
a
try
this
is
a
nice
take
on
the
style
but
really
lacks
the
overall
richness
smoothness
and
depth
of
an
elite
quad
its
still
pretty
drinkable
and
enjoyable
but
just
not
quite
on
par
with
the
elite
the
feel
of
this
beer
is
pretty
light
but
medium
bodied
with
some
nice
carbonation
to
go
with
the
easy
drinking
feel
of
this
beer
is
a
really
nice
ma
local
brew
as
usual
with
pretty
things
this
is
a
unique
take
on
a
traditional
style
a
dry
roasty
quad
with
very
little
sweetness
its
not
one
of
my
favorites
in
the
style
but
it
is
memorable
for
its
unusual
character
im
sure
this
brew
would
mellow
out
nicely
there
is
some
very
nice
complexities
and
flavors
at
the
heart
of
this
brew
d
pretty
drinkable
quad
soft
and
smooth
and
packs
a
punch
not
the
kind
of
beer
id
have
a
lot
of
in
a
night
but
one
that
id
have
again
drinkability
flavor
and
aroma
were
a
bit
off
but
this
was
nice
to
sample
i
enjoyed
it
dark
ruby

not
quite
opaque

very
dark

flavor

definitely
have
a
dark

etc
very
good
late
night
sipper
d
an
interesting
take
on
the
quad
style
the
taste
is
not
as
sweet
as
i
expected
nor
is
the
mouthfeel
and
smooth
or
rich
as
expected
both
of
which
detract
slightly
from
the
overall
experience
a
challenge
to
the
senses
it
little
bit
of
warming
goes
along
way
and
allows
the
complexity
to
breakthrough
pretty
things
is
doing
a
lot
of
great
things
and
while
this
may
not
be
my
favorite
offering
from
them
this
is

example
of
their
fine
craftsmanship

noticed
bit

not

taste
was
good
but
not
what
i
was
expecting
there
was
no
big
quad
taste
up
front
and
i
also
really
didnt
get
a
feel
for
the
dried
plums
at
all
just
tasted
like
an
average
belgian
brown
ale
there
was
no
big
juicy
fruity
sugary
aspects
to
this
beer
that
i
have
become
accustomed
to
with
quads
a
bit
thin
in
the
body
also
and
for
a
9
beer
didnt
feel
that
heat
at
any
point
its
a
nice
beer
to
drink
but
was
not
at
all
what
i
was
hoping
for
mouthfeel
is
sugary
full
bodied
and
sticky
sweet
with
raisin
cinnamon
rolls
resounding
along
the
palate
this
is
a
well
crafted
beer
but
i
found
the
body
a
little
thin
its
definitely
a
sipping
beer
that
should
be
enjoyed
over
a
period
of
time
so
the
intricate
flavors
come
out
as
the
beer
warms

but
this
beer
disappointed
on
the
finish
pretty
things
makes
some
good
beers
and
baby
tree
is
no
exception
its
a
big
quad
that
drinks
like
a
beer
half
its
size
overall
its
a
solid
beer
a

cloudy

it
had
a
very

when
held
up
to
the
light
a
fluffy
beige
cap
appeared
during
the

and
fell

there
was
a

md
the
first
thing
i
notice
is
that
the
body
is
a
little
thiner
than
most
quads
kind
of
dry
and
the
alcohol
content
slows
this
beer
down
drinkability
is
only
average
a
pretty
good
american
belgian
quad
overall

not
a

was

was
flowing
like
blood
from
a

victim
i
was
intrigued
to
try
this
quad
brewed
with
fruit
and
do
a
little
comparison
pours
a
hazy
sort
of
ugly
muddy
brown
color
with
a
lighttan
wispy
head
aroma
is
full
of
belgian
dark
esters
and
spices
without
much
plum
going
on
plum
finally
comes
through
more
in
the
flavor
but
its
a
mushy
mealy
overripe
plumminess
the
base
beer
is
very
yeasty
with
additional
accents
of
raisin
dark
bread
and
caramel
a
little
underwhelming
but
still
pretty
good
drinkability
is
insane
for
a

belgianstyle
ale
i
see
its
listed
as
8
7
on
here
but
the
bottle
says
9
mouthfeel
is
medium
and
smooth
booze
is
a
little
high
which
pulls
down
the
drinkability
but
the
flavor
is
good
so
its
enjoyable
eminently
drinkable
a
beer
to
sit
back
and
savor
ahh
belgian
quads
not
for
the
faint
of
heart
or
palate
a
deep
magohany
glance
stares
back
at
you

the
celebration
begins

you
back

hours
of

history
comes
alive
with
this

it

slowly
do
a
waltz
with
your

a

taste
coats
your

to
trade
stories
with

friends
this
ale
is
not
but
a
signature
to
a
good

this
ale
is
d
yet
another
good
thing
feom
pretty

i
would
not
have
been
able
to
pick
out
the

definitely
smells
belgian

that
is

begin
the
walk
to
her
car
use
caution
overall
a
very
good
quad
and
unique
in
a
very
good
way
ill
be
having
more
pretty
things
in
the
future
overall
im
glad
i
got
to
try
this
but
i
wouldnt
seek
it
out
and
i
really
appreciate
the
bottle
i
received
notes
much
lighter
than
expectedeasy
to
drink
it
was
goodbut
for
the
style
i
do
not
think
i
would
choose
this
again
just
too
heavy
on
plums
and
grapes
d
im
curious
to
know
how
large
a
role
the
dried
plums
played
in
the
finished
product
the
effect
seems
subtle
to
me
and
im
very
glad
for
it
i
really
enjoyed
lingering
over
this
topnotch
stuff
thanks
for
the
chance
to
try
andrew
i
truly
appreciate
the
hookup
consider
me
an
always
trader
for
you
overall
this
a
pretty
easy
drinking
quad
i
was
taking
big
gulps
trying
to
decipher
all
the
flavors
i
dont
know
much
about
the
style
having
had
only
one
other
quad
in
my
life
but
upon
reading
the
description
id
like
to
see
more
malt
flavor
in
this
beer
it
fits
the
bottles
description
but
not
i
guess
the
letter
of
what
a
quad
is
also
very
few
phenols
or
clove
like
flavors
as
a
beer
this
a
great
a
representation
of
the
style
maybe
not
its
up
to
decide
if
thats
necessary
or
if
the
beer
is
fine
on
its
own
it
isnt
that
complex
so
if
its
a
complex
and
strange
belgian
ale
your
looking
for
this
isnt
it
next
review
pretty
good
beer
not
really
as
interesting
as
belgian
quads
but
still
nice
excellent
brew
that
gets
better
as
it
warms
a
very
nice
twist
on
the
style
in
more
ways
than
one
drinkability
very
good
well
crafted
and
understated
beer
balanced
flavorful
refreshing
i
like
it
quite
a
bit
starting
to
really
trust
pretty
things
pours
a
dark
brown
color
with
some
honey
highlights
short
tight
head
that
settled
into
a
light
ring
the
aroma
is
quite
faint
some
barely
noticable
dark
fruit
notes
and
yeasty
phenols
but
that
is
it
the
taste
is
big
on
fruity
sweetness
with
some
cherry
and
grape
juice
flavors
which
transitions
into
a
raspberry
tartness
it
has
a
light
earthy
characteristic
but
it
is
short
lived
in
the
fruity
flavors
seems
to
have
more
of
a
fresh
fruit
juice
flavor
over
your
typical
boozy
dark
fruit
flavors
of
most
quadsbsdas
the
feel
is
light
and
extremely
fizzy
kind
of
burns
the
tongue
sweet
on
the
finish
a
decent
quad
seems
to
be
lighter
and
more
refreshing
than
others
in
the
style
the
flavors
are
kept
in
check
nothing
cloying
good
to
try
if
you
want
something
sweet
and
refreshing
but
not
overly
boozy
d
overall
not
the
most
intriguing
beer
in
an
otherwise
complex
style
everything
is
just
ok
here
the
one
part
of
baby
tree
that
stands
out
is
the
mouthfeel
very
smooth
goes
down
easy
and
this
significantly
enhances
the
drinkability
of
a
beer
that
is
otherwise
really
average
d
pretty
good
beer
nothing
special
and
actually
a
little
disappointing
for
a
quad
ill
buy
this
beer
again
for
sure
to
throw
in
a
cellar
and
just
because
i
like
the
art
of
the
bottle
and
want
to
help
this
brewery
do
great
things
like
i
mentioned
nothing
wrong
with
it
its
just
not
my
kinda
quad
i
hear
tell
pretty
things
tweaked
batch
2
so
i
may
give
that
a
go
but
im
pretty
ha
all
set
with
batch

the
plum
isnt
as
noticeable
as
i
thought
it
would
be
but
its
certainly
tasty
body
is
a
tad
lighter
than
i
like
in
a

but
again
its
very
tasty
and
definitely
drinkable
for
the
high
abv
d
yet
another
fantastic
pretty
things
beer
would
i
buy
more
of
it
absolutely
i
was
very
impressed
by
this
and
i
think
it
will
do
well
in
the
cellar
i
plan
on
buying
a
few
more
bottles
now
that
i
know
where
to
find
them
d
interesting
not
as
heavy
as
i
would
want
from
a
quad
in
all
honesty
it
could
use
some
more
alcohol
in
it
to
give
it
a
bit
more
zing
and
emphasize
the
interplay
with
the
fruits
pours
a
reddish
brown
color
with
a
large
tan
head
that
had
good
retention
the
head
settles
to
a
thick
cap
large
amount
of
sticky
lacing
is
left
on
the
glass
appetizing
aroma
of
dark
fruit
cloves
candied
sugar
and
malt
the
flavor
does
not
quite
live
up
to
the
aroma
has
a
dry
almost
caustic
component
that
brings
the
score
down
otherwise
has
nice
belgian
qualities
of
a
fruity
and
spicy
quad
and
slightly
vinous
not
as
sweet
as
most
has
a
good
body
with
nice
carbonation
that
gives
it
a
soft
texture
one
of
the
better
american
interpretations
of
the
quadrupel
style
worth
a
look
if
you
see
it
in
the
store
md
medium
bodied
a
little
on
the
thin
side
for
what
i
expect
from
a
quad
very
spicy
in
the
finish
and
it
lingers
in
your
mouth
very
easy
drinking
here
a
good
quad
not
great
but
certainly
good
this
beer
pours
a
brownish
plum
color
the
head
is
half
an
inch
in
height
and
recedes
slowly
into
a
thin
cap
of
lacing
the
aroma
is
of
plums
cloves
lots
of
spice
hints
of
bubblegum
and
belgian
malt
this
beer
smells
really
good
the
taste
is
much
like
the
aroma
there
is
lots
of
spice
lots
of
malt
and
enough
fruit
to
balance
things
out
the
mouthfeel
is
full
bodied
with
a
silky
texture
and
moderate
carbonation
overall
this
is
a
really
good
quad
that
i
will
surely
drink
again
this
is
the
third
beer
from
pretty
things
ive
tried
and
they
have
knocked
them
all
out
of
the
park
i
cant
wait
to
get
my
hands
on
some
more
this
is
a
sweet
fruity
thick
syrupy
ale
with
a
grape
like
taste
from
the
plums
and
maybe
some
pineapple
a
touch
of
citric
tanginess
and
good
dose
of
abv
this
is
a
sipping
beer
it
is
strong
it
has
some
warming
alcohol
notes
on
the
back
end
that
lead
into
the
finish
its
a
nice
strong
fruity
type
ale
that
has
much
to
recommend
it
the
beer
pours
a
darkish
brown
color
with
ok
head
retention
and
not
much
lacing
while
the
beer
didnt
look
all
that
impressive
in
this
case
looks
were
deceiving
the
aroma
profile
is
undeniably
pretty
sweet
with
brown
sugar
and
chocolate
coupled
with
some
underlying
prunes
and
cherry
flavors
on
the
palate
replicate
the
nose
pretty
closely
but
i
was
impressed
by
the
amount
of
flavor
and
richness
in
this
beer
i
would
describe
the
mouthfeel
as
no
more
then
medium
bodied
with
a
fairly
long
finish
drinkability
is
ok
though
you
can
tell
the
alcohol
is
up
there
a
bit
in
this
one
which
coupled
with
the
sweetness
makes
drinking
this
beer
rather
slow
going
nevertheless
i
thought
this
a
very
nice
effort
from
this
new
to
me
brewery
i
have
mixed
feeling
about
this
one
the
aroma
is
right
up
there
among
the
best
of
the
style
but
after
that
im
not
sure
if
it
does
it
for
me
overall
though
this
is
a
very
interesting
beer
and
im
very
curious
to
try
more
pretty
things
brews
in
the
near
future

with
a
small
light
beige
head
that
doesnt
really
last
smells
of
bready
fruity
and
even
tangy
yeast
pretty
reminiscent
of
chimay
première
actually
a
wee
bit
of
chocolateroastiness
sweet
overall
the
taste
has
all
of
the
same
characteristics
a
doughy
but
fruity
yeast
presence
along
with
a
good
amount
of
sweet
dark
malt
brown
sugar
very
sweet
finish
that
leaves
a
rather
cloying
aftertaste
kind
of
like
cracker
jacks
warming
full
body
too
sweet
though
i
guess
that
keeps
with
the
style
i
really
dug
this
one
i
think
a
tad
bit
of
aging
would
smooth
it
out
even
more
nice
to
have
such
a
hopped
quad
worth
seeking
out
overall
a
good
entry
for
the
quad
field
impressive
considering
this
brew
is
american
a
really
nice
quad
balanced
without
being
too
cloying
i
love
the
plums
in
this
beer
really
drives
the
flavor
and
pushes
the
fruit
to
the
forefront
highly
recommend

this

it

well
with
the
sweet

this

reminded

a

of

of
traditional

while
the
beer
is

theres
also

taste
is

upfront
fruit
in

middle
and
the
close
finds
the
spice
and
alcohol
coming
together
im
having
trouble
separating
the
flavors
they
all
merge
so
well
mouthfeel
is
way
smooth
and
drinkability
is
excellent
liking
this
not
as
strong
or
sweet
as
some
other
quads
i
have
tried
but
that
is
a
good
thing
good
thing
i
bought
a
few
because
this
will
be
a
great
beer
in
the
fall
i
absolutely
love
this
beer
its
one
of
my
favorites
ill
be
buying
it
again
and
again
and
again
the
beer
pours
a
cloudy
brown
color
with
a
14
tan
head
that
fades
to
lacing
the
aroma
is
good
it
has
a
solid
pale
and
crystal
malt
scent
along
with
a
nice
fruity
yeast
aroma
its
dry
with
a
bit
of
warmth
and
plum
aroma
its
not
overly
fruity
just
complimentary
the
taste
is
good
as
well
it
has
a
smooth
malty
flavor
thats
rich
in
crystal
malts
and
belgian
ale
yeast
the
dried
plums
add
some
complexity
but
the
yeast
is
the
dominant
flavor
here
the
mouthfeel
is
fine
it
is
a
full
bodied
beer
with
adequategood
carbonation
this
is
a
tastey
brew
i
tried
it
at
the
acbf
and
couldnt
wait
to
buy
a
bottle
for
home
nice
work
md
the
mouth
is
nice
on
this
sweet
and
a
bit
syrupy
i
would
say
baby
tree
as
an
above
medium
body
with
light
carb
especially
when
it
warms
a
smooth
sipper
with
just
a
bit
of
heat
when
going
down
the
abv
is
not
as
high
as
other
quads
which
is
a
nice
change
of
pace
the
lighter
abv
does
not
take
away
from
the
taste
which
is
superb
i
would
have
no
problem
drinking
a
whole
bomber
of
this
i
would
not
be
stumbling
around
afterwards
this
might
benefit
from
some
short
term
aging
but
it
is
great
where
its
at
now
the
mouthfeel
is
on
the
fuller
side
of
medium
bodied
with
a
soft
delicate
but
fairly
active
carbonation
this
one
starts
off
being
a
little
hohum
but
it
grows
on
you
im
liking
the
earthy
sort
of
dryness
drinkability
definitely
not
bad
i
think
it
may
be
slightly
young
at
this
point
but
honestly
its
packed
full
of
big
flavor
and
not
too
sweet
the
most
important
trait
for
any
belgium
for
me
very
impressive
for
such
a
young
brewery
or
at
least
a
young
bottling
brewing
honestly
have
no
clue
about
them
thanks
adam
drinkability
drinkability
is
good
but
suffers
a
bit
from
the
sweetness
overall
a
pretty
good
beer
from
pretty
things
pours
dark
prunish
purpleybrown
into
my
tulip
with
a
nice
lofty
head
and
some
sticky
lacing
as
the
beer
goes
down
smell
is
sort
of
boozey
which
is
odd
kind
of
sweet
that
boozey
smell
may
be
plums
since
i
get
it
on
the
taste
too
it
doesnt
taste
boozey
but
something
with
that
slightly
bracing
bitterness
that
eventually
smooths
out
i
think
it
is
the
plums
sweet
plum
velvety
nice
and
smooth
it
takes
a
bit
to
get
used
to
but
it
becomes
very
drinkable
when
you
do
probably
my
least
favorite
pretty
thing
so
far
but
by
no
means
a
poor
showing
for
the
summer
it
is
a
pretty
cold
dismal
day
out
that
reminds
me
more
of
fall
for
this
reason
i
decided
to
pick
up
something
with
a
little
alcohol
girth
to
it
before
i
go
any
further
the
artwork
on
this
beer
and
all
pretty
things
beers
which
i
believe
are
drawn
by
dann
are
some
of
the
coolest
out
there
on
to
the
beer
dark
in
color
sort
of
burgundy
a
quick
forming
head
that
quickly
becomes
white
lacing
with
multiple
levels
dark
stone
fruits
meld
very
well
with
the
quad
character
sometimes
this
style
gives
off
smells
and
flavors
of
dark
fruit
not
unlike
the
ones
found
here
in
this
case
however
the
addition
of
dried
plums
does
raise
the
bar
a
bit
without
becoming
too
sweet
or
artificial
seeming
besides
the
fruit
other
accompanying
complexities
include
some
brown
bread
molasses
bubblegum
powdered
sugar
and
delicate
alcohol
mouthfeel
is
full
bodied
yet
very
manageable
when
this
brew
first
hit
the
shelves
in
april
some
friends
of
mine
felt
that
it
was
a
bit
too
hot
if
that
sentiment
was
true
it
is
drinking
superbly
right
now
still
i
am
sure
a
year
or
more
of
cellar
time
would
do
wonderful
things
to
this
brew
my
final
thoughts
are
that
this
fits
in
perfectly
with
the
rest
of
pretty
things
exceptional
line
of
beers
bas
not
within
the
distribution
area
of
this
brewery
should
be
setting
their
sights
on
baby
tree
and
the
rest
on
the
lineup
quite
drinkable
might
be
a
good
gateway

another

a
good

not
the

plenty
interesting
and

to
the

would
recommend
at

one
try
and
i
would
gladly
purchase

i
liked

its
not

intense
as
other
quads
but
it
has
a

overall
a
very
nice
entry
into

d
the
quad
designation
is
somewhat
misleading
this
is
just
a
straight
up
good
dark
higher
octane
brew
with
some
belgian
characteristics
suspend
disbelief
on
style
expectations
and
enjoy
its
an
engaging
inviting
offering
from
pretty
things
that
embodies
the
fecundity
of
late
spring
i
like
this
but
i
want
to
like
it
more
maybe
cause
im
an
unabashed
homer
that
wants
to
see
a
plan
come
together
like
the
pretty
things
project
i
dont
want
to
only
drink
this
out
of
local
loyalty
im
straddling
the
fence
its
good
and
id
have
no
shame
sharing
it
with
anyone
could
it
be
better
of
course
ditch
the
butts
deal
and
this
is
an
excellent
local
with
a
belgian
take
as
is
its
merely
quite
good
ill
definitely
look
for
it
again

i
have

from
pretty

i
prefer
this
as
it
warms
to
the

and
higher

it
does
seem
to
follow
belgian
quads
in

while
good
it
isnt

the
best

having
another
small
high
quality
brewery

in
philly
like
this
is
appreciated
jesus

i
used
to
say
no
one
could
brew
a
decent
belgian
quad
except
for
the
belgians
and
unibroue
from
canada
but
this
has
proven
me
wrong
its
definitely
not
danns
previous
rapscallion
creation
type
quad
this
is
very
much
its
own
beer
and
with
the
addition
of
the
plums
actually
very
true
to
style
this
beer
can
hold
its
own
with
chimay
or
westy
any
day
of
the
week
kudos
to
dann
every
beer
youve
brewed
is
phenomenal
final
thoughts
good
sipping
quad
i
really
enjoy
this
new
brewery
propject
even
in
boston
they
can
be
a
little
difficult
to
find
but
they
are
well
worth
the
effort
mmmm
pretty
things

used
to
bring
oddities
of
his
years

while
he
jumped
around
breweries
they
were
always
anticipated
much
like
reading
about
the
new
offerings
now
the
anticipation
is
quite
itchy
my
wife
i
eagerly
grabbed
up
another
first
batch
for
the
evening
of
bison
burgers

salad
brewed
last
month
we
happily
started
the
dinner
with
this
lovely
1p9
6oz
big
bottle
of
lovely
belgian
quadstyle
plum
ale
mmm
plum
the
pour
was
a
nice
cloudy
brown
with
reddish
hue
and
minimal
head
lace
but
an
immediate
banana
aroma
that
disappeared
and
did
not
linger
in
the
slightest
the
dark
plumskin
currant
wheat
aroma
prevailed
thereafter
but
not
in
any
overwhelming
manner
the
flavor
was
likewise
with
some
wheatymalt
lemon
peel
leaving
a
bit
of
mustiness
in
the
nose
quite
a
delicious
dinner
session
i
tend
to
find
that
most
not
all
of
course
belgian
style
beers
brewed
in
america
tend
to
fall
just
short
coming
across
as
a
bit
of
an
imitation
but
this
one
is
just
great
it
did
not
cross
my
mind
that
i
was
drinking
a
particular
style
of
beer
or
beer
from
a
particular
region
meant
to
taste
like
x
y
or
z
but
simply
that
i
was
drinking
good
beer
thats
the
way
it
should
be
o
one
of
the
best
on
tap
at
sabatinis
in
exeter
pa
i
am
not
the
best
reviewer
of
quads
but
this
is
probably
the
easiest
drinking
and
smoothest
quad
ive
had
flavors
are
strong
but
never
overpowering
nice
smell
not
too
sweet
sits
nice
in
the
mouth
smooth
head
smooth
finish
you
will
never
know
this

such
as

great

and
a
great
beer
to
sweet
not
my
kind
of
beer
i
will
not
drink
this
beer
unless
there
are
no
other
choices
an
exquisite
quad
that
definitely
shows
the
world
why
the
trappists
are
so
good
at
what
they
do
beautiful
deep
dark
brown
with
a
nose
dominated
by
sweetness
and
dried
fruits
taste
follows
the
nose
and
is
exactly
what
i
expect
from
a
quad
and
more
nice
thickish
mouth
feel
and
very
warming
a
great
dessert
beer
or
just
a
sipper
after
a
long
day
excellent
highly
recommended
excellent
brew
you
wont
be
disappointed
watch
out
though
its
potent
my
current
favorite
quad
i
got
to
sample
this
on
tap
at
yard
house
and
it
became
my
favorite
kind
of
belgium
beer
the
taste
is
so
complex
that
it
aroused
my
tastebuds
wherever
it
touched
theres
no
better
way
to
describe
it
its
just
so
different
from
other
beers
ive
had
so
dont
underestimate
it
they
did
a
good
job
hiding
the
alcohol
too
despite
its
high
abv
paired
well
with
happy
hour
food
i
had
yard
house
amber
pour
with
light
head
aroma
of
prunes
strong
raisinfig
flavor
start
to
finish
its
a
strong
flavor
true
to
the
style
but
i
personally
found
the
taste
lacking
depth
mf
smooth
even
with
the
high
abv
4
soft
enticing
aromas
of
candisugar
brown
sugar
plus
an
abundant
array
of
fruits
like
raspberries
figs
and
pears
i
could
find
barely
a
trace
of
the
10
abv
the
flavor
follows
the
smell
and
it
is
incredibly
rich
and
deep
the
sugar
is
present
but
this
doesnt
come
across
as
all
that
sweet
a
gentle
blanket
of
warmth
and
a
strong
fruity
presence
make
sure
this
stays
balanced
the
body
is
full
and
lush
with
creamy
quality
that
coats
the
mouth
absolutely
topnotch
what
took
me
so
long
to
try
this
love
this
beer
wish
i
ccould
afford
it
more
often
my
connection
sucks
so
if
i
slure
my
words
its
ipad
problem
of
red
fruits
high
carbonation
and
alcohol
definitely
present
and
a
bit
overpowering
this
is
a
nice
one
but
i
fear
i
had
it
too
early
one
of
my
favorite
beers
ever
not
bad
little
sweet
could
be
round
in
the
mouth

a
way
light
carbonation
and
mouthfeel
for
the
style
not
my
favorite
quad
but
it
is
nevertheless
excellent
if
the
sweetness
doesnt
bother
you
this
is
a
little
sweet
for
me
however
the
malts
and
hops
balance
it
out
pretty
well
i
have
to
say
this
is
a
damned
good
trappist
quad
good
flavor
its
a
little
cloudy
for
the
style
it
might
come
across
as
a
little
too
boozy
for
some
i
generally
like
these
full
bodied
full
flavored
beers
tasty
great
complex
beer
poured

chalice
pours
a
clear
caramel
colored

with
a
bit
of

tinge
my
bottle
was
new
according
to
the
printed
date
and
my
glass
was
cleaned
to
the
standards
i
have
been
taught
but
i
only
observed
about
a
finger
of
cream
colored
head
that
receded
within
a
minute
into
a
foamy
sheet
that
clings
to
the
glass
i
say
this
out
of
surprise
after
what
i
have
read
but
whatever
this
is
my
review
smell
was
hinting
of
dates
but
overpowered
by
the
banana
pudding
that
was
much
more
pronounced
than
i
expected
and
a
finish
of
alcohol
taste
was
hinting
of
dates
spice
and
dark
chocolate
but
was
again
dominated
with
banana
pudding
had
a
a
somewhat
pronounced
but
not
unwelcome
or
overpowering
bitterness
going
down
and
a
very
slight
earthiness
in
the
aftertaste
the
alcohol
is
definitely
deceptive
and
did
not
make
its
presence
easily
known
especially
for
a
beer
with
such
a
high
abv
it
was
velvety
smooth
from
the
moment
of
sip
to
swallow
with
only
a
slight
hint
of
carbonation
on
the
tongue
overall
a
very
enjoyable
experience
that
makes
me
wonder
if
my
senses
are
more
sensitive
to
banana
pudding
than
the
average
person
i
find
that
i
dont
have
as
much
experience
with
quads
as
i
would
like
and
as
a
result
i
may
update
my
review

later

overall
this

not
my

but
definitely
a
beer
extremely
well
crafted
and
worth
a
try
the
tap
version
has
a
little
less
carbonation
and
it
is
a
little
less
soft
shifting
some
of
the
flavors
from
dark
dried
fruits
to
plums
m
less
carbonation
than
suggested
by
the
froth
coming
out
of
the
bottle
after
opening
but
still
above
average
medium
syrupy
body
o
the
flavour
here
starts
off
very
well
and
it
is
very
nicely
spiced
but
for
me
the
heavy
solvent
boozy
end
detracts
from
everything
else
this
beer
is
doing
that
is
a
shame
really
as
it
is
a
very
nice
beer
and
could
have
been
better
with
more
control
of
the
solvent
end
very
good
for
the
style
an
a
plus
o

excellent
smooth
full

i
cant
compare
it
to
anything
else

ive
never
had
anything
like
it
if
you
like
ales
youll
love
this
with
a
good
balance
of
yeast
flavors
carbonation
just
a
tad
present
and
booze
this
was
everything
that
i
could
ask
for
in
a
quad
easily
enjoyable
from
start
to
finish
there
was
a
lot
to
enjoy
here
without
feeling
cluttered
and
heavy
a
musttry
for
any
belgian
beer
aficionado
and
something
that
ill
be
looking
out
for
again
just
a
notch
below
the
best
of
this
style
but
more
than
easily
holds
its
own
regardless
overalldrinkability
very
light
and
wellcarbonated
for
a
belgian
quad
would
be
nicer
if
abv
were
wellhidden
o
probably
the
most
deceptively
light
and
most
aromatic
quad
ive
had
went
alright
with
the
pasty
goat
cheese
and
figs
i
ate
with
it
excellent
and
i
recommend
it
any
chance
i
get
o
this
beer
has
a
lovely
aroma
but
the
flavours
are
all
ruined
by
the

if
you
want
this

if
you
are

caution
as
this
10

is
deceptive
its
as

smooth
as
your
grandma
said
it
would
be
i
find
this
to
be
a
faultless
beer
unless
you
plan
on
having
more
than
a

the

bitter

which
should
be
a

with
temperance
this
could
prove
to
be
an
ally

for

have

mo

of

alcohol
one
of
the
best
quads
ive
had
you
definitely
get
some
lingering
alcohol
but
its
needed
to
balance
the
beer
out
and
give
it
a
bourbon

a

beer
ill
take
another
please
overall
not
the
best
trappist
quad
ive
triedbut
still
very
good

is
definitely
the
strongest

yeasty

i
have
had
tried

at
the
social
list

overall
ive
tried
this
beer
about
half
a
dozen
times
and
the
bottles
do
vary
the
older
bottles
are
more
fruity
tasty
and
the
newer
ones
more
alcoholic
this
bottle
was
fairly
young
and
could
be
kept
for
a
couple
of
years
and
the
flavours
would
become
more
complex
overall
a
potent
enigmatic
brew
like
the
type
of
beer
i
imagine
druids
drinking
and
at

wouldnt

this
was
a

a

a

sweet
not

how
well
this
will
hold
up

some

alcohol
is

hidde
great
the
taste
begins
with
a
tart
dark
fruity
note
and
a
searing
bitterness
at
the
end
but
it
is
not
a
puckerup
bite
it
just
drills
its
way
into
the
sensation
and
lingers
briefly
the
booze
is
a
bit
more
forward
in
the
taste
than
on
the
nose
its
a
quad
and
it
is
meant
to
have
some
punch
from
a
22oz
cage
and
cork
pours
to
a
glass
with
a
medium
brown
color
when
held
up
to
the
light
heavily
carbonated
on
the
tongue
which
is
a
good
characteristic
of
a
quad
sweet
initial
taste
featuring
notes
of
honey
follow
by
a
bitter
punch
fitting
because
this
beer
claims
to
use
two
different
hop
varietals
weighing
in
at
a
low
25
ibu
the
thre
different
malts
gives
a
hint
of
caramel
on
the
nose
excellent
quad
especially
considering
its
dutch
not
belgian
this
is
a
good
one
i
still
consider
myself
a
neophyte
in
the
style
but
as
far
as
im
concerned
its
a
good
one
for
a
trappist
product
however
it
doesnt
really
deliver
the
goods
as
some
of
its
peers
most
notably
chimay
bleue
but
its
definitely
a
good
introduction
to
beginners
to
this
often
daunting
rich
style
of
beer
its
a
little
too
light
overall
for
me
and
a
little
too
phenolic
on
the
yeasty
side
but
its
definitely
one
that
id
have
again
if
offered
to
me
overall
this
is
definitely
a
great
quad
but
not
top
of
the
line
for
me
probably
my
third
or
fourth
favorite
trappist
quad
very
much
like
a
tripel
though
the
color
was
a
cloudy
amber
and
the
abv
higher
good
sized
whiteish
head
that
dissipated
quickly
leaving
a
very
light
amount
of
lacing
reasonably
sweet
lots
of
breadyeast
flavor
minimal
bitterness
light
to
medium
body
hides
the
alcohol
extremely
well
carbonation
was
less
than
i
expected
overall
good
not
great
drank
it
at
48f
from
a
tulipi
think
i
would
have
enjoyed
it
more
if
it
were
5
degrees
cooler
and
if
id
been
in
a
better
moodim
recovering
from
frostbit
fingers
and
was
hoping
that
this
750ml
bottle
would
lift
my
spirits
it
did
not
a
little
more
carbonation
would
have
helped
too
this
brew
will
definitely
go
in
my
rotation
love
it
overall
a
very
good
quad
i
would
have
preferred
less
oak
but
that
is
not
a
showstopper
enjoy
overall
drinkability
a
good
quad
but
one
is
enough
per
evening
good
with
a
meal
sloppy
joes
green
leaf
salad
and
im
sure
it
would
be
good
by
itself
as
a
slow
sipping
beer
a
bit
light
on
the
mouthfeel
and
lacks
complexity
and
sweetness
atmosphere
is
really
nice
light
head
and
some
light
yet
persistent
lacing
nose
is
sweet
and
fruity
sweet
and
malty
with
a
lightly
bitter
balance
overall
this
is
a
really
good
quaff
overall
nice
sweet
fruity
quad
o
a
good
quad
definitely
not
the
best
id
take
bernardus
or
rochefort
over
this
any
day
pannepot
is
better
as
well

with

and
a
little
lacing
smell
is
of
nice
brown
belgian
candy
sugars
and
smells
quite
sweet
there
is
also
some
dark
fruits
in
the
background
with
a
little
cloves
and
nutmeg
taste
is
nice
and
sweet
likely
from
the
belgian
candy
sugar
you
can
taste
some
of
the
nice
banana
yeast
in
the
background
but
its
not
as
upfront
as
in
some
belgian
type
beer
i
realize
this
is
not
a
belgian
but
it
tastes
just
like
one
and
is
very
good
at
hiding
the
high
abv
of
the
beer
mouthfeel
is
quite
thick
and
great
for
the
style
overall
a
great
trappist
beer
that
i
need
to
drink
more
of
everything
a
quad
should
be
o
this
is
my
second
go
with
this
beer
my
first
experience
being
less
than
fantastic
this
time
the
beer
had
a
bit
more
age
on
it
at
least
another
six
months
and
it
made
a
world
of
difference
this
was
an
enjoyable
quad
not
in
the
same
league
as
the
big
boys
like
rochefort
and
st
bernardus
but
a
nice
beer
nonetheless
osolid
quad
better
as
it
warmed
good
sipping
this
is
a
very
pleasant
quad
o
good
sipper
a
good
quad
with
some
nice
flavours
coming
through
solid
in
one
word
not
my
favourite

overall
this
is
a

it
doesnt
have
the
very

i
was
expecting

dark
fruits
malt
spices
and
banana
is
just
about
perfect
very
enjoyable

there

the
taste
has
a
mellow
oakey
backbone
with
a
nice
dry
and
semi
sweet
candied
flavors
finishes
warm
and
the
oakeyness
returns
full
flavors
good
body
easy
to
drink
overall
a
very
solid
quad
o
belgian
beer
does
not
travel
well
to
east
asia
possibly
due
to
having
been
left
out
in
the
sun
and
no
doubt
having
been
tossed
about
in
cargo
ive
had
it
a
few
times
before
and
its
been
fantastic
so
im
adding
points
in
consideration
of
that
i
no
longer
think
belgian
dark
ales
are
the
beallandendall
of
beer
connoisseurship
but
every
now
and
then
they
really
hit
the
mark
this
pours
a
caramellyamber
in
color
with
minimal
foam
theres
a
great
bouquet
on
this
with
notes
of
raisin
and
some
light
banana
figuring
prominently
its
on
the
sweeter
side
for
a
quad
with
a
pleasing
carameldried
fruit
characteristic
and
a
rounded
finish
tasty
didnt
realize
this
was

poured
into
a
snifter
from
a
bottle
bought
at
the
local
store
dark
orange
color
with
a
foamy
head
a
sweet
malty
smell
lots
of
fruit
very
smooth
beer
with
strong
banana
flavor
the
10
hits
a
little
at
the
end
but
not
as
much
as
you
would
expect
finishes
with
notes
of
oak
like
a
good
scotch
very
pleased
definitely
worth
a
second
bottle
this
pours
medium
brown
color
with
a
fizzy
offwhite
head
the
aroma
is
yeasty
with
hints
of
bananas
this
has
a
very
full
body
with
banana
and
yeasty
flavors
there
are
lots
of
complex
flavors
that
deliver
a
very
good
brew
very
well
made
and
well
worth
the
try
o
such
an
amazing
quad
the
oak
complements
the
rest
of
the
flavors
so
well
resulting
in
a
tasty
drink
certainly
deserves
to
be
sipped
not
very
carbonated
pretty
heavy
and
full
bodied
sort
of
medicinal
finish
pretty
solid
quad
o
pretty
simple
compared
to
other
trappist
quads
but
still
delicious
and
bursting
with
flavor
very
enjoyable

remarks
did
not
score
a
t
s
m
at
that
time
disregard
those
scores
o
i
guess
its
good
for
the
style
but
quads
arent
my
thing
it
actually
resembles
an
intense
tripel
o
good
beer
for
the
style
well
worth
checking
out
sorry
that
my
review
was
so
strait
forward
but
sometimes
simplicity
is
best
overall
another
great
trappist
beer
this
feels
more
like
a
trippel
than
a
quad
but
maybe
thats
just
due
to
how
well
balanced
and
drinkable
this
is
for
such
a
high
abv
beer
very
sweet
with
lots
of
dark
fruit
and
breadiness
o
nice
quad
and
a
really
good
example
of
this
style
i
would
definitely
drink
again
highly
recommended
a
must
drink
beer
overall
a
rather
boozy
and
crisp
quad
with
a
whole
lot
of
sparkling
wine
like
characteristic
i
was
actually
originally
expecting
something
with
more
dark
fruit
flavors
so
this
was
quite
a
surprise
it
was
rather
interesting
and
nice
and
is
certainly
worth
a
try
although
i
think
it
is
not
really
my
thing
and
i
think
there
are
tastier
quads
out
there
very
complex
beer
good
for
having
on
a
mellow
pleasant
evening
at
home
highly
recommendable
a
trappist
icon
for
good
reason
delighted
to
have
found
on
draught
overall
its
big
but
untamed
uncouth
and
unrefined
some
might
say
thats
great
but
this
feels
like
an
experiment
let
loose
like
a
tiger
on
a
circus
crowd
it
doesnt
have
the
structure
or
the
depth
of
purpose
i
want
in
a
beer
thats
this
big
this
feels
like
someone
let
off
a
mound
of
tnt
in
a
pile
of
bricks
and
hoped
theyd
get
a
house
out
of
it
big
and
explosive
but
without
the
end
result
83100
for
the
style
83100
for
personal
taste
o
a
very
nice
quad
but
i
wouldnt
put
it
in
the
top
tier
a
bit
to
sweet
without
enough
esters
and
a
bit
too
much
caramel
bottom
line
if
your
running
the
rails
with
trappist
brews
this
is
a
good
place
to
start
o
im
not
a
huge
fan
of
quadrupels
but
this
a
pretty
good
one
o
it
grew
on
me
a
little
as
i
drank
it
not
as
nuanced
and
seamlessly
put
together
as
some
of
its
other
trappist
counterparts
but
still
well
worth
a
look
ohad
as
a
part
to
my
countdown
to
westy
xii
a
nice
quad
overall
will
not
get
again
not
my
favorite
for
my
personal
taste
i
thought
there
could
be
more
going
on
i
like
darker
brew
anyways
and
i
was
really
impressed
with
the
tripel
ive
been
looking
forward
to
trying
this
for
some
time
superb
lightly
spicy
aroma
with
caramel
malt
and
hints
of
honey
abv
well
hidden
the
light
spicing
in
the
nose
is
much
more
obvious
in
tasting
rich
and
complex
flavor
but
unfortunately
it
is
just
too
sweet
on
the
other
hand
the
aftertaste
is
great
o
i
had
only
tasted
this
beer
in
bottle
before
so
the
draft
was
much
better
in
fact
i
could
use
the
term
awesome
loved
it
had
this
on
tap
in
greece
during
my
vacation
overall
a
very
nice
beer
i
did
like
the
glass
it
was
served
in
beer
had
a
nice
dark
red
color
not
a
lot
of
head
but
a
bit
of
carbonation
taste
stayed
the
same
throughout
and
it
paired
well
with
the
german
style
fare
that
was
served
overall
a
very
good
beer

d
tasty
beer
i
was
in
the
mood
for
something
just
like
this
o
great
quad
a
little
in
the
lighter
side
compared
to
other
squads
but
flavor
wise
spot
on
a
must
have
for
the
belgian
beer
people
in
general
a
wonderful
complex
beer
doesnt
fit
the
tasting
notes
of
a
quad
this
comes
with
cellaring
it
for
a
while
next
bottle
will
be
a
year
or
more
to
double
check
my
analysis
i
just
took
it
to
a
discriminating
colleen
and
she
said
yum
is
this
a
grand
cru
she
gave
the
big
thumbs
up
also
big
yum
o
this
is
a
very
flavorful
beer
which
has
a
decent
balance
and
screams
belgium
quad
even
though
its
from
the
netherlands
poured
into
a
la
trappe
chalice
pours
a
hazy
almost
coppery
medium
amber
with
a
fine
two
finger
off
white
head
with
great
retention
and
lacing
complex
aroma
of
caramel
maltplums
dark
dried
fruit
light
cherry
and
banana
a
hint
of
sour
and
mineral
flavor
is
sweet
well
integrated
fruit
dominated
by
plums
light
hints
of
stone
fruit
dried
dark
fruit
and
cherry
sweet
malt
finishes
somewhat
drier
leaving
pleasant
residual
light
hops
fruit
and
a
touch
of
wood
medium
creamy
bodied
a
very
nice
trappist
quadrupel
that
is
a
joy
to
drink
overall
what
a
total
beast
of
a
beer
i
mean
what
is
there
not
to
ask
for
if
you
share
a
passion
like
i
do
for
quality
grab
a
glass
and
pour
salud
overall
a
recommended
beer
not
a
stereotypical
quad
but
a
very
pleasant
beer
nonetheless
quite
an
enjoyable
quad
hits
all
the
high
points
of
a
belgian
and
an
excellent
interpretation
of
the
style
on
the
fruitier
more
bubbegummy
side
of
the
belgian
spectrum
recommendable
overall
a
very
easy
to
drink
and
flavorful
quad
didnt
really
stand
out
much
from
others
i
have
had
but
still
very
good
and
a
must
try
o
not
exactly
unique
or
groundbreaking
but
fulfills
its
role
as
a
smooth
flavorful
quad
at
a
generally
reasonable
price
ill
probably
drink
it
again
but
i
dont
think
ill
die
if
it
comes
off
the
market
if
youre
into
trappist
beers
though
its
a
definite
musttry
the
quad
tastes
like
some
toasted
malt
is
present
with
the
yeast
adding
a
clove
accent
with
mild
honeylike
tinge
and
floral
hop
element
adding
to
the
complexity
with
subtle
alcohol
in
the
taste
and
the
strength
is
not
all
that
apparent
with
malt
providing
the
majority
of
the
flavor
with
a
nice
effervescent
yeast
that
leads
to
a
dry
mineral
tinged
finish
a
great
belgian
and
originator
of
the
quad
style
i
have
been
enjoying
this
for
over
a
decade
i
am
happy
to
drink
this
on
occasion
and
it
is
very
drinkable
for
the
style
o
this
is
a
pretty
decent
quad
but
not
as
good
as
some
of
the
others
i
have
had
but
i
would
for
sure
drink
it
again
v
never
doubt
a
trappist
ale
great
beer
overall
the
taste
is
by
far
the
best
thing
about
this
beer
but
its
a
bit
too
sweet
for
me
has
a
nice
balance
though
of
all
the
trappists
ive
had
la
trappe
is
the
one
i
enjoy
the
least
this
is
not
their
worst
beer
though
and
much
better
than
some
other
heavy
belgian
beers
taste
is
richly
fruity
wine
toastedcaramelised
grain
finish
it
is
zesty
yet
silky
firm
but
not
too
heavy
and
nicely
engaging
this
is
a
fantastic
beer
if
you
can
get
it
get
it
o
i
really
enjoyed
this
most
classic
trappist
quad
and
am
sure
to
buy
more
chears
o
flavorful
goes
down
ok
not
too
filling
strong
kick
decent
representation
of
style
its
a
decent
beer
but
there
are
better
options
in
the
style
o
a
good
quad
overall
and
probably
overlooked
since
its
so
common
i
dont
know
if
it
can
stand
up
to
westy
12
or
the
blauw
but
its
still
enjoyable
and
affordable
o
very
nice
beer
will
have
again
though
not
my
favorite
o
its
an
enjoyable
belgian
ale
with
a
lot
of
the
spicy
flavors
expected
in
the
style
its
on
the
sweet
side
but
still
a
solid
representation
of
the
style
drinkability
its
a
very
smooth
drinkable
beer
accompanied
with
good
flavors
and
aromas
solid
quad
overall
really
nothing
much
to
it
lacking
character
and
proper
mouthfeel
boring
and
too
much
like
candy
maybe
cellaring
had
a
negative
affect
this
is
the
second
la
trappe
review
ive
had
that
ranked
their
beer
way
lower
than
others
did
so
somethings
up
this
is
my
first
beer
from
this
brewery
and
while
ive
enjoyed
a
lot
of
the
trappist
ales
and
tend
to
seek
them
out
when
i
get
the
chance
this
is
just
an
ok
beer
to
me
it
tastes
good
but
the
esters
in
the
beer
are
dominant
they
power
through
any
interesting
malt
this
beer
might
have
had
to
begin
with
and
end
up
as
a
relatively
boring
one
note
beer
i
drank
my
bottle
of
it
and
i
will
try
other
things
from
this
brewery
but
so
far
im
not
overly
impressed
this
is
one
of
the
best
quads
ive
ever
had
it
doesnt
get
nearly
as
much
fanfare
as
westy
rochefort
etc
but
its
every
bit
as
good
rjt
overall
really
good
stuff
i
was
expecting
it
to
be
a
little
more
heavy
taste
and
feel
wise
but
the
lightness
gives
it
a
nice
drinkability
albeit
the
beer
has
a
high
abv
but
its
very
well
hidden
food
match
dutch
and
belgian
cuisine
seems
appropriate
for
this
borderline
dessert
beer
boerenkool
met
rookworst
möppkenbrot
zuurkoolstamppot
and
stoemp
could
all
work
oi
was
quite
impressed
with
this
one
its
sooo
much
better
than
the
oak
aged
version
it
has
so
many
more
flavors
its
so
drinkable
and
the
mouthfeel
is
so
much
more
what
i
expect
from
a
trappist
ale
i
could
get
this
again
and
again
overall
very
good
but
definitely
overshadowed
by
the
westy
and
rochefort
10
much
thinner
and
with
a
dominating
ester
profile
compared
to
the
brown
sugarmolasses
of
the
others
overall
4
5
excellent
beer
and
what
a
beer
it
is
quads
are
few
and
far
between
for
good
reason
few
brewers
can
make
one
that
is
palatable
the
brothers
at
la
trappe
have
turned
out
a
brew
that
is
not
only
acceptable
it
is
excellent
highly
recommended
and
worth
the
price
you
will
pay
also
please
remember
that
this
is
a
quad
and
it
is
10
abv
probably
a
little
higher
huge
frothy
head
when
poured
on
top
of
a
nice
purple
with
ruby
edges
smells
of
spice
and
dark
fruit
plums
prunes
grapes
raisins
apples
pears
lighter
color
than
i
would
expect
from
the
style
but
a
pretty
amber
tastes
of
figs
raisins
plums
and
pears
with
some
spice
on
the
finish
light
bodied
for
a
quad
but
a
nice
bite
at
the
end
that
keeps
it
from
being
too
sweet
good
beer
reddish
brown
colour
with
a
large
pale
beige
head
the
head
recedes
to
a
retentive
thin
cap
and
coats
the
glass
with
lace
aromatic
notes
of
toasted
bread
raisin
and
fig
with
delicate
pepper
and
only
a
hint
of
alcohol
the
flavour
starts
of
with
toasted
malt
joined
by
dried
fruit
and
hints
of
brown
sugar
and
peppery
phenols
midpalate
finishes
dry
and
with
a
light
medicinal
note
that
adds
complexity
mediumbodied
with
moderate
carbonation
the
carbonation
is
fine
and
soft
giving
the
beer
a
somewhat
soft
and
smooth
mouthfeel
good
beer
i
feel
that
this
would
be
a
fine
mealtime
drinker
i
could
see
this
pairing
well
with
a
red
meat
stew
like
beef
or
venison
or
with
a
good
steak
this
would
also
make
a
great
accompaniment
to
a
cheese
board
it
has
enough
flavour
that
it
should
hold
up
to
the
food
but
not
so
much
that
it
might
outshine
it
the
mouthfeel
was
also
nice
and
the
alcohol
is
at
a
nice
level
o
a
very
sweet
and
drinkable
beer
that
everyone
should
try
i
especially
recommend
this
is
you
like
dark
fruit
presence
in
beers
as
this
beer
is
almost
syrupy
the
one
gripe
i
have
is
that
the
yeast
presence
can
get
a
little
bit
overwhelming
at
parts
that
being
said
it
is
still
an
extremely
good
beer
okay
im
done
typing
i
need
to
get
back
to
enjoying
this
amazing
beer
overall
a
wonderful
beer
and
a
true
classic
that
no
beer
fan
should
avoid
forever
it
has
everything
you
want
in
a
great
quad
the
rich
flavor
and
slight
booziness
reminds
me
of
rochefort
10
though
it
lacks
a
little
bit
of
the
power
of
that
beer
nevertheless
drink
this
one
carefully
and
dont
drive
anywhere
when
youre
done
poured
into
a
goblet
pours
deep
hazy
copper
with
a
fingerlength
offwhite
head
that
recedes
slowly
but
does
leave
a
small
cap
of
lacing
once
it
recedes
there
are
plentiful
visible
tiny
bubbles
in
the
beer
there
are
aromas
of
sweet
and
bready
malts
there
are
light
aromas
of
dark
fruits
and
banana
with
some
mild
sweetness
the
taste
has
a
nice
blend
of
those
bready
and
sweet
malts
along
with
the
dark
fruits
and
banana
the
alcohol
can
be
found
in
the
flavor
the
body
is
on
the
medium
side
of
full
with
plentiful
carbonation
the
alcohol
provides
a
warming
character
for
this
beer
it
is
a
solid
sipper
this
is
a
very
good
beer
o
and
from
the
dutch
trappists
we
get
a
winner
its
not
a
perfect
quad
by
any
means
but
it
really
is
delicious
and
drinkable
and
thats
what
counts
in
the
end
overall
good
flavors
maybe
a
little
different
from
really
great
belgian
quads
the
fruitiness
is
a
little
lacking
and
the
alcohol
is
intense
still
enjoying
the
hell
out
of
this
though
you
can
do
much
better
for
big
trappists
o
nice
relaxing
sipper
nothing
overbearing
but
nothing
stands
out
either
just
easy
to
drink
one
is
enough
to
be
enjoyed
o

im
really
not
a
fan
of
banana
notes
in
beer
and
am
not
really
a
fan
of
pears
period
i
detect
both
in
this
beer
yet
still
really
like
it
ive
had
some
other
quads
that
promise
more
robustness
than
they
deliver
which
is
surprising
and
kind
of
novel
but
i
want
that
back
end
this
one
really
brings
it
at
a
satisfying
level
from
the
first
sip
it
has
the
body
i
want
its
interesting
to
drink
it
slowly
and
see
what
the
gradual
warming
brings
pours
a
murky
honey
brown
with
a
foamy
beige
head
that
settles
to
an
oily
film
on
top
of
the
beer
small
dots
of
lace
form
around
the
glass
on
the
drink
down
smell
is
of
malt
dark
fruit
brown
sugar
and
spice
taste
is
much
the
same
with
a
mild
spice
bitterness
on
the
palate
with
each
sip
this
beer
has
a
lower
level
of
carbonation
with
a
slightly
crisp
and
medium
bodied
mouthfeel
overall
this
is
a
good
beer
that
is
tasty
and
easy
to
drink
overall
fantastic
belgian
quadrupel
havent
had
one
before
but
it
kind
of
reminds
me
of
how
a
port
or
a
sherry
is
to
wine
it
is
like
a
fortified
beer
which
it
probably
is
at
10
abv
only
thing
holding
me
back
is
the
price
au116
per
case
in
2012
ouch
to
be
honest
though
it
is
in
fact
worth
it
well
done
cant
say
that
it
offers
anything
unexpected
or
overthetop
but
good
rich
flavors
a
mouthfeel
to
grapple
with
o
this
quad
has
a
ton
of
potential
but
needs
a
year
or
two
of
aging
to
come
around
a
great
beer
for
the
cellar
the
beer
is
brown
in
color
slightly
veiled
nice
foamy
head
on
top
of
it
big
bubbles
the
head
disappear
quickly
the
aroma
is
very
fruity
some
cherry
and
notes
of
bananas
in
the
mouth
still
strong
presence
of
fruits
and
some
malts
in
there
too
strong
and
big
beer
chewy
a
true
sipper
delicious
the
abv
is
well
hidden
a
nice
one
cheers
o
this
beer
is
quite
enjoyable
but
it
much
more
the
sipping
beer
than
one
that
is
easy
to
drink
the
alcohol
is
not
as
well
hidden
as
i
expected
making
this
take
a
little
more
effort
to
drink
overall
exceptional
beer
that
is
priced
accordingly
i
recommend
11
2
oz
bottle
which
is
a
perfect
finish
to
any
evening
a
very
pleasant
though
strong
beer
sweet
but
not
overlyso
with
a
decent
amount
of
fruit
and
spice
definitely
a
slow
sipper
this
is
one
to
enjoy
at
the
end
of
a
long
day

original
review
on
07192010
overall
a
solid
quad
in
the
same
league
w
rochefort
10
st
bernardus
12
an
old
favorite
a
contender
for
favorite
trappist
highly
recommended
o
nice
quad
but
not
one
that
i
would
put
up
there
with
the
likes
of
rochefort
10
or
westy
12
still
a
nice
offering
that
is
relatively
easy
to
find
o
not
a
bad
quad
but
not
the
best
in
the
world
worth
a
shot
especially
since
it
is
a
trappist
but
not
a
true
jawdropper
d
a
classic
quad
that
fits
the
bill
quite
well
fitting
of
the
trappist
name
and
reputation
taste
um
not
exactly
what
i
was
expecting
there
is
a
ton
of
yeast
and
it
dominates
its
such
a
yeast
forward
quad
that
i
had
trouble
getting
past
it
definitely
a
spicy
yeast
that
takes
over
the
hints
of
dark
fruits
o
super
fruity
quad
for
sure
not
that
that
is
particularly
unusual
very
estery
and
a
little
boozy
overall
a
good
traditional
example
of
the
style
as
the
style
would
suggest
this
is
a
good
sipping
beer
that
pairs
well
with
reading
or
contemplation
overall
its
quite
good
but
a
much
funkier
quad
than
others
ive
tried
less
dark
fruit
and
more
belgian
overall
this
is
a
good
quad
not
perfect
but
very
nice
for
it
being
such
a
big
beer
alcohol
it
mimics
that
of
a
lighter
trippel
very
nice
indeed
o
this
was
a
pretty
enjoyable
quad
although
its
much
better
when
closer
to
room
temperature
as
the
flavors
seem
to
work
better
with
the
alcohol
aside
from
the
noticeable
alcohol
the
flavor
and
aroma
are
quite
good
and
provide
solid
depth
i
wouldnt
mind
trying
this
beer
again
sometime
preferably
with
some
age
to
mellow
out
some
of
the
heat
o
well
balanced
quad
abv
is
deceptive
nice
representation
of
the
style
o
very
complex
and
enjoyable
glad
i
was
able
to
try
it
la
trappe
quad
has
one
of
the
smoothest
pours
ive
ever
seen
leaving
a
very
creamy
head
that
lingers
quite
a
while
and
leaves
beautiful
lacing
its
burnt
orange
in
colour
and
carbonation
just
streams
up
the
glass
like
crazy
very
very
nice
looking
the
smell
has
a
lot
of
subtleties
in
it
which
ive
never
been
very
good
at
describing
i
smell
some
cherry
and
belgian
yeast
mostly
with
light
spices
the
taste
is
quite
simply
amazing
its
perfectly
balanced
with
a
sweet
malt
character
up
front
and
bitter
hops
in
the
finish
in
between
its
a
great
ride
of
spice
and
fruit
mouthfeel
a
5
i
dont
normally
do
that
but
it
actually
is
perfect
so
incredibly
creamy
with
a
nice
dry
finish
i
adore
this
beer
and
i
look
forward
to
trying
the
other
beers
in
the
la
trappe
family
o
a
tasty
big
brew
even
though
the
whole
idea
of
a
quad
always
seems
a
little
contrived
to
me
i
never
look
a
beer
horse
in
the
mouth
o
excellent
belgian
quad
i
want
more
pours
a
amber
capped
by
a
nice
foamy
head
with
amazing
retention
lots
of
visible
carbonation
nose
is
ripe
banana
burnt
sugar
and
booze
taste
is
similar
with
the
addition
of
dark
fruit
perhaps
plum
is
most
evident
medium
bodied
buy
very
creamy
mouth
yum
o
if
i
had
to
drink
a
single
beer
for
the
rest
of
my
days
this
would
probably
be
it
it
stands
along
side
such
greats
as
westy
rochefort
10
and
st
bernardus
12
fastastic
complexity
and
amazing
amazing
mouthfeel
this
must
have
required
a
great
deal
of
diving
intervention
i
would
recommend
above
all
others
amazing
overall
a
magnificent
beer
final
grade
4
1
a
very
respectable
a
having
had
only
this
one
quad
im
definitely
not
an
expert
in
the
style
but
i
knows
what
i
likes
this
is
an
enjoyable
sipper
that
i
would
happily
recommend
to
another
newbie
deliciously
complex
and
underrated
on
here
whats
not
to
like
overall
not
too
bad
faint
fruit
though
on
the
finish
and
not
exactly
moving
a
nice
malt
sense
carbonation
seems
to
take
away
from
some
of
the
nice
qualities
its
a
little
too
fizzy
and
theres
a
hint
of
alcohol
heat
a
bit
pretty
solid
regardless
but
not
a
favorite
great
big
beer
its
prominently
sweet
but
still
good
drinkable
o
great
beer
great
quad
very
complex
and
i
love
that
its
just
a
tad
dry
and
the
flavorful
taste
and
nose
thebeeralmanac
com
o
outstanding
worth
the
price
i
could
smell
this
one
all
day
and
slowly
sip
the
yummy
belgian
goodness
this
is
a
perfect
quad
the
exemplary
belgian
quad
in
my
book
pours
a
nice
hazy
medium
amber
color
with
a
vibrant
off
white
head
nose
of
smokey
wood
belgian
yeast
and
candy
sugar
flavor
is
great
so
smooth
ive
got
some
slight
fruits
and
some
gentle
sweetness
wicked
complex
if
i
was
less
stoned
id
have
better
adjectives
but
this
one
is
hitting
all
the
notes
mouthfeel
is
as
good
as
it
gets
very
bright
carbonation
and
a
medium
body
turning
into
buttery
silk
love
the
mouthfeel
on
this
one
overall
an
excellent
beer
even
though
it
might
score
lower
by
these
qualifications
i
like
it
better
than
the
oaked
quad
just
a
perfect
illustration
of
what
a
beer
can
be
lovely
o
this
one
has
loads
of
hidden
flavours
and
is
extremely
dangerous
coming
in
at
10
abv
you
will
not
be
disappointed
and
im
hoping
i
can
secure
another
bottle
to
age
really
a
spectacular
quad
notes
not
too
bad
of
a
beer
its
very
sweet
is
not
a
bad
thing
and
rather
drinkable
o
i
suggest
you
respect
the
abv
and
sip
through
this
one
although
it
was
so
delicious
i
wanted
to
keep
the
glass
raised
you
will
want
to
savor
it
to
the
last
drop
god
bless
the
trappist
monks
drinkability
excellent
stuff
for
some
reason
i
get
the
feeling
i
am
drinking
a
piece
of
heaven
othe
alcohol
is
much
more
noticeable
than
the
other
characteristics
of
this
beer
it
was
enjoyable
as
an
in
between
beer
on
new
years
but
nothing
close
to
the
quality
of
st
b
an
ok
quadrupel
never
my
favourite
style
a
real
sipper
o
4
dark
burgundy
elixer
a
few
fingers
of
roasted
marshmallow
head
and
bits
of
floaties
yumma
smells
like
some
sweet
raisin
and
and
sugar
cookies
belgian
yeast
and
faint
coca
cola
thick
sweet
bready
yeasty
a
hint
of
spice
and
lots
of
love
in
the
palate
basically
it
tastes
like
christmas
dessert
in
a
bottle
really
it
is
the
epitome
of
all
the
flavors
i
taste
in
other
quads
and
say
i
wish
it
had
more
of
this
or
that
well
all
those
great
notes
are
expressed
strongly
in
this
quad
thick
heavy
body
and
cuddly
carbonation
caress
the
tongue
in
a
syrupy
chewy
mess
overall
im
a
happy
camper
if
you
have
the
means
i
highly
recommend
it
overall
it
was
a
good
quad
but
the
smell
took
some
points
away
because
i
really
couldnt
distinguish
much
else
because
of
this
i
have
had
every
trappist
quad
multiple
times
and
this
one
is
my
least
favorite
still
a
decent
beer
and
worth
a
try
o
one
of
the
best
trappist
quads
ive
ever
had
not
too
much
alcohol
flavor
like
some
other
quads
rochefort
10
not
too
sweet
great
overall
flavor
is
definitely
strong
but
not
too
much
so
has
a
great
complexity
to
it
probably
one
of
my
top
10
favs
so
far
in
my
journey
i
havent
been
a
huge
fan
of
trappest
beers
and
this
non
belgian
versions
proves
that
monks
should
stay
out
of
beer
overall
this
is
well
balanced
flavorful
beer
deserving
of
the
quad
title
if
only
it
wasnt
so
expensive
o
despite
the
feel
the
flavors
in
this
beer
are
delicious
and
the
booze
is
hidden
well
very
drinkable
quad
body
is
incredibly
thick
and
syrupy
o
really
a
balanced
quad
no
date
on
the
bottle
but
i
would
very
interested
to
understand
the
aging
effect
on
this
beer
this
is
the
way
a
quad
should
be
o
its
an
enjoyable
belgian
ale
with
a
lot
of
the
spicy
flavors
expected
in
the
style
its
on
the
sweet
side
but
still
a
solid
representation
of
the
style
overall
it
is
well
carbed
and
the
mouthfeel
fits
the
style
properly
there
are
several
quads
out
there
and
while
this
one
is
smooth
and
tasty
there
are
others
that
are
better
balanced
with
the
sweetness
a
nice
enough
quad
the
problem
here
is
really
that
it
is
a
mainstreamed
quad
lacking
in
the
deep
rounded
rich
and
beautiful
character
of
the
rocheforts
and
westvleterens
of
this
world
o
a
good
drink
but
my
only
other
quad
was
de
struisses
pannepot
which
is
devine
and
this
didnt
appeal
to
me
as
much
definitely
worth
checking
out
if
youre
into
tripels
quads
andor
trappistbelgian
mediumdark
ales
overall
the
alcohol
is
fairly
present
in
this
one
but
it
does
not
really
detract
from
my
tasting
experience
instead
it
serves
as
a
gentle
reminder
that
this
is
a
sipper
and
my
speed
of
consumption
should
match
that
as
far
as
quads
go
it
definitely
doesnt
make
the
list
of
favs
which
is
disappointing
i
was
looking
forward
to
it
being
a
trappist
and
all
good
but
not
great
o
i
had
this
beer
once
just
before
i
took
a
westvleteren
12
believe
me
the
la
trappe
quadrupel
didnt
have
to
bow
before
the
westvleteren
12
it
uphold
nicely
and
therefore
i
say
this
beer
is
world
class
too
poured
a
reddish
golden
brown
with
a
soapy
white
head
excellent
lacing
and
pretty
good
head
retention
nose
is
lightly
grapey
plums
vanilla
sweetness
breadiness
some
green
apple
and
a
touch
of
alcohol
taste
is
very
caramelly
plummy
sweet
and
more
grapes
a
touch
too
sweet
for
my
liking
as
ive
always
felt
this
beer
is
slightly
syrupy
and
some
spice
in
the
finish
slightly
sticky
and
syrupy
in
the
feel
too
but
but
great
carbonation
full
but
not
too
thick
lightly
alcoholic
quite
nice
and
this
improves
as
it
warms
an
aerates
a
good
quad
thats
on
the
sweeter
side
overall
this
is
one
of
my
favorite
beers
the
alcohol
scared
me
a
bit
but
after
a
few
sips
i
realized
how
smooth
it
was
the
dryness
makes
you
want
another
sip
the
taste
makes
each
sip
easy
o
this
is
a
great
belgian
quad
one
that
i
would
definitely
come
back
and
drink
again
mouthfeel
was
medium
with
good
carbonation
drinkable
but
its
best
to
take
it
slow
with
this
one
10
is
no
joke
and
you
can
get
a
bit
of
alcohol
taste
from
this
especially
as
it
warms
making
it
a
little
less
drinkable
overall
i
enjoyed
this
brew
overall
like
this
beer
alot
it
is
a
very
interesting
representative
of
the
style
and
it
is
a
little
different
with
its
origins
in
the
netherlands
rather
than
belgium
you
can
really
taste
the
difference
and
i
loved
that
it
was
very
interesting
quite
a
bit
of
a
disappointment
for
me
as
i
really
enjoy
this
style
this
one
however
is
just
too
sweet
the
flavors
arent
dark
enough
and
a
bit
monolithic
in
flavor
o
this
has
to
be
up
there
with
some
of
the
best
quads
i
really
think
ill
have
to
try
some
more
offerings
from
koningshoeven
overall
a
great
tasting
quadrupel
i
look
forward
to
trying
more
omg
this
has
got
to
make
the
top
of
the
list
ive
tried
la
trappes
tripel
and
dubbel
and
chimay
grand
reserve
blue
has
always
been
my
favorite
until
last
night
when
i
tried
this
quadrupel
smooth
rich
bold
and
perfectly
balanced
trappist
ale
at
its
best
d
excellent
example
of
the
style
everything
is
great
about
this
brew
despite
the
high
alcohol
content
it
has
good
drinkability
and
leaves
you
wanting
more
after
every
sip
overall
its
an
exceptional
beer
overall
a
very
enjoyable
belgian
ale
has
great
front
flavors
marked
by
the
tremendous
carbonation
a
middle
where
the
smoothness
and
complexity
really
come
out
and
a
tart
aftertaste
results
in
a
comfortable
alcoholwarming
sensation
from
mouth
to
stomach
overall
this
is
a
great
beer
and
a
contender
with
the
top
quads
o
this
is
a
nice
quad
very
sweet
just
as
it
should
be
pours
a
dark
copper
color
w
a
nice
three
finger
cocoa
head
massive
lacing
is
evident
on
my
snifter
good
carbonation
as
well
a
little
lighter
in
appearance
in
i
would
think
for
a
quad
but
still
a
nice
looking
brew
the
nose
has
blackberry
yeast
alcohol
caramel
malt
slight
hops
and
other
berries
to
it
a
little
on
the
weak
side
but
very
nicely
put
together
it
definitely
improves
w
warming
though
so
ive
knocked
it
up
a
notch
taste
is
very
similar
to
the
nose
profile
and
you
definitely
get
a
nice
alcohol
burn
on
this
one
almost
too
much
so
carbonatedalcohol
burnmalty
feel
on
this
beer
i
imagine
this
would
age
extremely
well
and
really
smooth
out
its
a
little
too
hot
right
now
overall
this
is
a
solid
quad
trappist
ale
and
definitely
worth
getting
if
you
enjoy
the
style
cheers
taste
is
wonderfully
sweet
and
complex
more
of
lighter
fruits
like
figs
than
other
quads
very
rich
deep
flavor
i
cant
help
savor
it
as
i
drink
it
each
sip
is
a
little
different
than
the
last
very
creamy
and
also
quite
refreshing
like
other
great
quads
this
one
continues
to
be
delicious
as
it
warms
o
solid
quad
but
was
unfortunately
able
to
finish
it
due
to
the
excessive
sweetness
and
alcohol
burn
the
waiter
at
lazyboys
in
white
plains
brought
it
to
me
instead
of
the
triple
that
i
asked
for
best
mistake
of
the
evening
a
dark
pour
that
erupts
with
aromas
of
dark
candies
and
a
hint
of
plum
sweet
taste
that
masks
the
high
gravity
of
the
beer
hops
are
not
forward
at
all
mostly
malt
dominated
but
not
detracting
one
i
plan
to
brew
a
clone
of
drinks
wonderfully
complexity
increases
as
you
let
it
warm
up
on
tap
at
beermarket
in
toronto
pours
dark
amber
with
a
lasting
white

aroma
is
of
caramel
dark

outstanding
brew
do
10
abv
is
completely
hidden
here
until
it
begins
to
work
its
devilish
magic
as
this
beer
will
warm
you
up
wonderfully
drinkable
and
a
great
overall
experience
one
of
if
not
my
fav
trappist
ale
d
ok
but
very
light
i
expected
something
more
assertive
o
overall
very
nice
but
i
wish
some
of
the
darker
flavors
and
complexity
from
the
smell
carried
over
to
the
taste
a
bit
more
still
a
very
nice
beer
this
is
very
typical
of
why
i
like
this
style
so
much
has
a
nice
blending
of
flavors
has
that
typical
belgian
candy
sugar
taste
i
have
grown
to
like
and
low
bitterness
this
would
be
an
excellent
beer
to
have
on
a
cold
winter
night
the
alcohol
would
keep
you
warm
and
the
taste
would
keep
you
wanting
more
good
beer
but
not
among
the
best
of
the
style
certainly
very
happy
to
drink
a
bottle
of
it
but
it
would
be
nice
if
the
sweetness
could
be
toned
down
sweet
sharp
and
underlaid
with
dark
bitterness
dark
amber
in
the
new
belgium
tulip
with
nice
lacing
fairly
coarse
carbonation
in
the
mouth
but
lots
of
it
alcohol
is
a
hot
hammer
on
the
throat
more
of
a
liqueur
than
a
beer
but
reasonably
amount
of
hops
hugely
fruity
with
raisins
toasted
fruit
cake
and
dried
figs
nice
nose
of
roasted
barley
sweetness
seems
overpowering
at
first
but
the
vast
range
of
the
belgian
complexity
gives
it
a
lot
of
interest
i
thought
it
was
quite
sippable
at
refrigerator
temp
though
it
changes
as
it
warms
slightly
and
the
darker
burnt
flavors
emerge
more
overall
drinkability
great
beer
nearly
identical
in
many
ways
to
the
rochefort
10
but
for
some
reason
hasnt
impressed
me
as
much
i
really
like
this
beer
but
rating
it
in
style
now
that
ive
had
a
few
quads
this
is
going
to
be
rated
a
bit
below
the
user
average
o
i
wasnt
expecting
much
going
into
this
compared
to
the
other
trappist
ales
but
its
pretty
fantastic
huge
flavor
profile
with
an
abundance
of
fruits
and
light
rumburgundy
alcohol
presence
the
mouthfeel
isnt
exactly
what
i
like
in
the
style
but
it
makes
it
easy
to
drink
o
great
beer
this
one
would
lay
down
super
nice
and
the
alcohol
would
die
down
a
bit
super
good
and
exactly
to
style
o
strong
in
body
and
flavour
but
still
pleasantly
drinkable
not
even
close
to
the
harmony
or
complexity
of
most
belgian
quads
though
o
not
a
bad
beer
but
theres
many
quads
id
take
over
this
one
it
does
have
a
fairly
different
taste
profile
than
many
of
the
style
and
is
fairly
light
bodied
but
at
this
price
point
it
will
be
hard
for
me
to
come
back
to
this
one
with
so
many
other
options
available
not
quite
as
tasty
and
smooth
as
some
of
my
favorite
dark
belgians
but
nonetheless
a
success
and
a
great
beer
price

foods
nyc
sustained
taste
flavor
evolves
as
a
great
beer
should
toward
the
end
a
subdued
milk
chocolate
even
made
an
appearance
which
was
quite
unexpected
aftertaste
is
like
a
mouthful
of
rich
buttermilk
pancakes
with
maple
syryp
while
this
quadrupel
is
a
little
more
yeasty
than
i
normally
prefer
that
sourness
is
held
in
exceptional
balance
with
the
sweetness
there
is
no
denying
that
this
is
a
very
wellputtogether
beer
the
flavors
are
compelling
the
mouthfeel
is
excellent
and
it
finishes
as
great
as
it
starts
o
very
complex
absolutely
beautiful
flavors
intermingling
together
incredibly
easy
drinking
with
no
sign
of
alcohol
presence
delicious
o
this
is
a
good
beer
but
even
if
its
one
of
the
true
trappist
beers
it
doesnt
feel
like
the
one
it
is
slightly
too
sweet
and
slightly
too
thick
to
be
as
drinkable
as
the
other
trappist
ales
i
had
m
medium
body
this
quadrupel
was
excellent
and
despite
the
warming
feel
of
the
alcohol
at
10
it
was
not
readily
detectable
overall
incredibly
good
for
a
10
abv
with
just
the
slightest
hint
of
alcohol
it
has
a
dark
amber
colour
and
a
very
thick
dense
head
it
has
a
bit
of
applespineapples
and
banana
in
the
aroma
a
suggestion
of
sugar
or
caramel
in
the
palate
and
malty
sweetness
in
the
finish
i
dont
feel
the
10
abv
the
brewmaster
was
very
tricky
poured
from
bomber
into
snifter
glass
pours
clear
mahogany
brown
with
a
creamy
thick
beige
head
aroma
of
wet
dank
cardboard
dark
fruit
dark
caramel
and
some
musty
wood
the
flavor
is
more
sweet
dark
fruit
slightly
sour
yeast
plum
dark
belgian
candi
sugar
and
some
light
bitterness
medium
to
full
body
with
average
carbonation
and
a
smooth
soft
mouth
feel
overall
a
decent
quad
but
seems
a
bit
oxidized
this
beer
pours
light
to
medium
bodied
and
a
dark
amber
in
color
with
a
one
finger
off
white
head
it
is
very
translucent
for
the
style
i
really
expected
something
darker
it
smells
of
sweet
brandy
plums
and
is
very
bready
you
can
definitely
get
a
good
amount
of
sweet
malts
from
the
nose
but
the
10
is
well
hidden
the
flavors
are
much
sweeter
than
anticipated
you
get
alot
of
sweet
fruit
infused
bread
a
ton
of
yeast
plums
and
candied
sugar
its
definitely
the
sweetest
quad
ive
had
yet
i
just
cant
get
behind
the
flavors
there
just
isnt
enough
going
on
if
you
can
get
past
all
the
sugar
it
drinks
fuller
than
it
appears
it
drinks
medium
to
full
in
body
and
is
a
smooth
drink
with
no
alcohol
left
behind
in
the
aftertaste
perhaps
im
being
picky
but
i
cant
get
behind
this
beer
it
doesnt
come
anywhere
near
anything
by
st
bernardus
and
its
in
the
same
price
range
i
wouldnt
necessarily
want
to
try
this
one
again
poured
into
a
westmalle
chalice
light
chesnut

with
a
warm
red
glow
when
held
to
the
light
fizzy
cream
colored
head
also
tinted
with
the
red
hue
smell
is
complex
with
hints
of
alcohol
fruity
and
nutty
a
wonderful
rich
taste
which
reveals
different
flavors
in
time
dark
fruit
rich
malt
a
hint
of
chocolate
and
an
ever
lingering
flavor
of
raspberries
chocolate
covered
raspberries
the
mouthfeel
is
excellent
the
velvety
texture
coats
the
mouth
and
remains
for
quite
some
time
an
excellent
beer
and
more
motivation
for
me
to
seek
out
more
quads
to
try
this
is
a
damned
fantastic
beer
though
i
will
say
that
i
wish
it
finished
just
a
bit
drier
nonetheless
it
is
phenomenal
and
the
alcohol
is
so
well
hidden
that
this
beer
is
damn
dangerous
fucking
delicious
o
love
the
style
and
would
recommend
this
one
perhaps
a
bit
too
carbonated
and
would
like
some
more
aroma
but
a
nice
effort
here

had
better
quads
but
this
is
still
a
great
beer
poured
a
dark
brown
with
a
small
but
thick
head
that
retained
throughout
the
session
sugary
aroma
and
bready
with
belgian
yeast
very
strong
taste
as
would
be
expected
sweeter
and
more
fruity
than
many
quads
ive
had
caramel
and
brown
sugar
plums
and
nectarines
definite
alcohol
bite
medium
mouthfeel
well
carbonated
and
decently
drinkable
but
not
in
large
quantities
the
sweetness
is
not
a
bad
thing
but
i
do
prefer
other
quads
to
this
delicious
flavorful
brew
a
real
joy
to
drink
in
spite
of
the
wallop
it
packs
highly
recommended
d
tasty
but
not
something
i
could
drink
more
than
two
glasses
of
750ml
bottle
pours
slightly
hazy
mahogany
with
a
light
tan
head
and
very
active
carbonation
aroma
has
great
ripe
pit
fruit
plum
candied
sugar
and
dried
fruit
apricot
taste
is
sweet
but
not
cloying
very
light
hops
on
the
end
medium
bodied
with
a
slicksticky
texture
a
bit
fizzy
and
a
smooth
finish
this
is
la
trappes
best
commonly
available
beer
and
a
world
class
quad
the
alcohol
is
expertly
hidden
which
makes
this
a
dangerous
beer
o
almost
too
much
for
me
at
first
but
given
more
time
to
get
to
know
the
style
i
could
see
myself
growing
too
appreciate
it
more
i
wont
necessarily
be
rushing
to
find
another
bottle
but
its
definitely
worth
trying
i
enjoyed
how
fresh
and
fruity
this
first
appeared
before
hitting
you
with
the
sweet
boozy
characteristics
you
come
to
expect
not
my
favourite
nor
the
most
complex
quad
around
but
is
a
fantastic
sipper
on
this
easter
sunday
ive
loved
this
quadrupel
since
the
first
time
i
had
it
a
few
years
back
i
felt
that
i
needed
to
revisit
this
to
give
it
a
fair
review
poured
this
into
a
snifter
glass
its
got
a
light
muddy
brown
color
with
a
thick
tan
head
on
top
that
stick
around
for
the
majority
of
the
time
the
smell
of
this
beer
sucks
me
in
every
time
the
aromas
that
come
off
of
this
brew
are
sweet
fruits
and
some
nice
malts
with
just
a
bit
of
yeast
in
there
it
nearly
smells
like
candy
to
me
the
taste
is
lovely
all
those
fruits
and
the
yeast
come
alive
once
it
hits
your
tongue
it
tastes
pretty
much
exactly
how
it
smells
the
mouthfeel
has
a
really
nice
creaminess
to
it
and
mixed
with
some
lively
bubbles
this
beer
just
impresses
me
with
each
sip
a
must
try
served
from
a
11
2
oz
bottle
in
a
small
tulip
glass
the
beer
pours
a
hazy
orange
amber
color
with
a
finger
of
white
thick
head
with
nice
retention
and
lacing
the
aroma
is
strong
with
banana
orange
and
spice
notes
the
taste
and
mouthfeel
is
quite
thick
and
somewhat
buttery
with
similar
notes
as
the
aroma
overall
an
ok
belgian
quad
but
definitely
not
the
best
flandes
bar
in
oviedo
asturias
o
nectar
of
the
gods
hard
to
imagine
anything
better
get
it
if
you
can
loved
this
easy
to
drink
but
not
sessionable
sweet
fruity
complex
and
bitter
appropriately
almost
passed
this
by
loved
this
nothing
harsh
o
an
excellent
beer
and
an
exceptional
belgian
overall
this
beer
is
a
pretty
good
quad
but
not
as
good
as
chimay
blue
or
rochefort
10
probably
my
least
favorite
trappist
beer
that
ive
tasted
but
its
still
good
because
all
the
other
trappist
beers
ive
had
were
exceptional
for
me
it
taste
more
like
a
barley
wine
then
a
quad
o
i
love
this
beer
its
not
overwhelming
in
alcohol
or
the
spice
flavor
you
often
get
in
high
alcohol
trappist
ales
its
very
very
sweet
and
the
alcohol
just
warms
all
the
way
down
this
is
a
very
nice
quad
but
not
my
favorite
seems
very
consistent
with
the
style
but
nothing
about
it
knocks
me
off
my
feet
except
the
alcohol
glad
to
have
tried
it
will
buy
something
else
next
week
notes
first
review
for
a
la
trappe
that
i
confess
i
had
left
aside
for
quite
a
bit
but
not
the
first
recent
brew
i
had
their
dubbel
a
month
or
two
ago
and
it
was
quite
good
it
made
me
want
to
see
what
their
quad
was
all
about
and
it
proved
itself
well
worth
it
ill
sure
keep
the
close
to
the
surface
in
my
choice
of
belgium
errr
dutch
brews
and
trappist
ones
in
particular
md
great
overall
experience
i
wouldnt
drink
a
bunch
on
these
in
one
sitting
as
i
think
its
important
to
give
all
your
attention
to
the
complexities
of
the
first
bottle
great
brew
md
this
had
a
medium
amount
of
carbonation
it
was
on
the
sweeter
side
as
quads
go
but
it
was
still
really
good
there
seemed
to
be
a
lot
going
on
fairly
complex
i
would
like
to
try
a
bottle
that
had
a
few
years
on
it
and
see
if
it
balances
out
a
little
bit
having
said
that
it
still
is
really
tasty
worth
the
purchase
d
enjoyed
this
very
much
after
a
bowl
of
spaghetti
bolognese
held
its
impact
all
the
way
through
surprisingly
drinkable
for
the
alcohol
content
but
i
would
be
a
mess
after
a
few
my
11
2
ounce
bottle
looked
nothing
like
the
one
in
the
photo
d
good
quad
i
would
like
to
taste
this
when
aged
bc
as
it
stands
fresh
is
to
strong
for
me
d
very
good
i
like
the
sweetness
and
the
age
has
really
subdued
the
alcohol
to
levels
that
cant
be
easily
detected
though
my
review
was
short
i
did
thoroughly
enjoy
this
quad
very
good
quad
here
not
up
to
par
with
its
belgian
trappist
counter
parts
but
def
worth
a
try
overall
this
beer
does
a
very
good
job
at
mingling
high
abv
with
great
belgian
quad
flavors
to
combine
for
great
taste
and
experience
on
the
lighter
side
of
the
amberdark

spectrum
it
really
highlights
the

end
of

not
my

fantastic
beer
how
can
it
be
anything
but
on
the
same
level
its
hard
not
to
compare
this
with
chimay
blue
similar
price
accessibility
abv
and
style
i
think
this
is
more
malt
forward
than
chimay
almost
like
a
dopplebock
if
your
into
that
sort
of
thing
this
should
be
your
choice
d
somewhat
lighter
and
fruiter
than
the
other
trappists
that
i
have
tried
so
far
surprisingly
drinkable
and
smooth
for
a
quad
overall
the
best
thing
about
this
brew
was
its
rich
aromatic
scent
as
soon
as
the
beer
was
poured
and
helped
along
by
the
carbonation
no
doubt
the
immediate
area
was
filled
with
ripe
tantalizing
esters
while
this
made
the
beer
so
inviting
and
seemingly
irresistible
the
taste
let
down
a
bit
it
was
flavorful
but
lacked
complexity
the
primary
notes
were
sweet
and
boozy
leaving
the
drinker
wanting
more
from
such
an
ambitious
powerful
style
t
pretty
much
the
same
as
the
nose
and
for
that
i
was
a
bit
disappointed
also
i
may
be
a
wuss
but
the
alcoholladen
resiny
aftertaste
was
rather
offputting
and
since
i
enjoy
a
good
barleywine
i
think
it
was
this
beer
in
particular
d
its
a
little
sweet
but
overall
the
drinkability
is
pretty
good
i
might
call
this
a
poor
mans
trappist
as
its
pretty
good
but
not
nearly
as
interesting
as
saint
bernardus
or
even
weyerbachers
quad
this
costs
about
as
much
as
those
not
thee
best
but
worthy
of
talking
about
its
10
so
1
and
done
for
sure
would
drink

store
tonight
juding
by
the
aroma
i
didnt
think
this
would
be
that
great
but
on
the
first
sip
i
was
shocked
at
how
delicious
this
was
definitely
worth
the
11
for
the
750
for
a
10
00
abv
this
is
high
drinkablevery
delicious
smooth
and
despite
the
boozy
nose
not
a
boozytasting
beer
in
the
slightest
to
me
this
easily
ranks
in
my
top
quads
with
three
philosophers
and
st
bernardus
abt
12
as
the
best
ive
ever
had
nothing
short
of
outstanding
koningshoeven
has
created
a
masterpiece
its
best
offering
in
my
humble
opinion
do
not
pass
this
by
drinkability
is
medium
i
probably
wouldnt
be
able
to
do
more
than
one
of
these
and
would
just
go
to
another
quad
if
i
could
this
is
an
incredible
quad
dangerously
quaffable
for
10
and
full
of
complexity
seek
this
out
the
subtle
variations
achieved
by
true
trappist
breweries
continues
to
astound
while
la
trappe
quad
is
not
as
full
bodied
as
rochefort
10
or
as
smooth
as
chimay
grand
reserve
it
is
certainly
the
equal
to
either
on
any
given
day
an
exceptional
beer
one
of
the
best
and
worst
days
a
beer
drinker
can
have
would
be
sitting
in
front
of
all
three
and
trying
to
decide
which
one
to
drink
first
this
is
very
drinkable
i
would
make
this
a
session
brew
if
not
for
the
higher
abv
d
very
drinkable
this
brew
poured
into
a
pint
glass
has
a
wonderful
light
amber
color
with
a
little
haziness
and
a
red
tint
held
to
the
light
there
is
a
nice
clean
white
head
that
was
frothy
and
left
nice
lacing
on
the
glass
the
aroma
was
of
sweet
clove
and
fig
a
nice
lingering
of
banana
and
some
mild
yeast
are
present
the
taste
is
one
of
the
better
quads
i
have
had
the
flavor
is
intense
but
not
over
powering
and
there
is
little
alcohol
aftertaste
that
sometimes
overpowers
this
also
has
a
strong
carbonation
that
leaves
little
flavor
bursts
on
the
tongue
very
nice
brew
i
can
tell
why
over
400
bas
review
this
so
well
thanks

drinkability
for
such
a
strong
beer
la
trappe
is
remarkably
drinkable
needless
to
say
two
pints
knocked
me
off
the
face
of
the
earth
i
also
noticed
that
when
you
want
to
purchase
this
at
the
liquor
store
it
comes
in
a
750ml
bottle
at
10
abv
thats
the
same
as
drinking
a
bottle
of
wine
so
in
future
ill
probably
limit
myself
to
one
serving
330ml
for
an
evening
i
find
this
to
be
one
of
the
worlds
greats
pours
an
amber
chestnut
brown
with
thick
foamy
yellowish
beige
head
aroma
of
plum
raisin
fig
chocolate
roasted
malt
and
strong
alohol
sweet
up
front
with
taste
of
dark
berries
chocolate
and
a
strong
maltiness
foloowed
by
a
dry
sweet
alcohol
finish
very
good
d
this
was
a
very
drinkable
ale
albeit
a
bit
boozy
and
alcoholladen
the
last
of
the
trappists
for
me
to
try
but
i
have
to
say
it
is
one
of
the
best
i
should
have
tried
this
years
ago
d
i
could
easily
turn
this
bomber
up
and
drink
the
whole
thing
straight
down
it
is
that
good
its
the
perfect
balance
of
everything
and
its
refreshing
nothing
heavy
about
this
at
all
outside
of
the
price
this
is
perfection
divine
out
of
a
750ml
corked
and
caged
bottled
under
the
koningshoeven
name
havent
seen
the
quad
in
a
few
years
anywho
pours
a
hazy
light
chocolate
brown
color
with
a
small
and
tight
beige
colored
head
that
settles
into
a
light
ring
the
aroma
is
fruity
with
red
wine
like
characteristics
with
a
musty
malt
and
candi
sugar
notes
big
bold
musty
flavor
red
wine
mixes
with
the
dark
candi
sugar
resulting
in
a
strong
raisin
flavor
some
fig
and
honey
rust
and
just
a
barely
there
chocolate
malt
la
trappe
really
brings
out
the
musty
flavors
in
their
brews
much
more
so
than
the
other
trappist
breweries
the
brew
sits
well
on
the
palate
with
fizzy
carbonation
fairly
crisp
sweet
throughout
despite
the
10abv
drinks
fairly
well
probably
less
malty
than
other
quads
but
plenty
fruity
better
to
savor
chteau
lafite
rothschild
pauillac
than
puke
on
the
md
2020
eh
d
being
a
quad
it
is
naturally
very
rich
and
a
sipper
it
is
not
one
to
have
a
lot
of
in
one
sitting
but
rather
one
to
enjoy
this
is
very
drinkable
and
by
the
end
of
the
bottle
i
wish
i
had
more
glad
to
try
this
one
this
is
my
first
trappist
ale
pours
brown
with
raspberry
hues
and
is
topped
with
a
twofinger
thick
tan
head
that
darkens
at
the
edges
and
sticks
to
the
glass
for
dear
life
slowly
fading
and
leaving
a
thin
but
consistent
lacing
around
the
glass
smells
complex
as
expected
with
dark
chocolates
up
front
followed
by
a
quick
fruit
burst
and
some
phenolic
notes
tastes
rich
and
hot
with
spice
dark
chocolates
and
cherries
noticed
at
first
in
the
background
is
some
grain
some
breadiness
and
a
nice
hint
of
hop
bitterness
mouthfeel
is
fullbodied
with
some
stickiness
is
left
on
the
lips
a
quick
shake
results
in
a
burst
of
quickly
settling
carbonation
bubbles
this
is
as
real
as
it
gets
d
i
would
have
to
call
this
one
of
the
gold
standars
of
the
style
a
truly
wonderful
multifacted
drinking
experience
you
wont
need
anything
else
for
the
evening
after
putting
this
one
in
your
stomach
between
the
flavor
and
the
abv
ride
out
the
joy
extremely
drinkable
10
abv
beer
very
good
beer
overall
this
is
a
decent
beer
but
not
particularly
drinkable
quite
sweet
and
lacking
in
flavor
profile
for
the
style
one
was
plenty
there
are
better
quads
out
there
for
sure
the
mouthfeel
was
out
of
this
world
everything
else
was
not
impressive
overall
a
nice
beer
i
wasnt
too
big
on
this
brewery
despite
it
being
trappist
but
i
like
this
one
definately
drinkable
nice
well
balanced
beer
that
hides
the
abv
very
well
d
this
beer
is
incredibly
drinkable
if
not
a
tad
sweet
unlike
many
ales
with
doubledigit
abvs
this
one
lacks
the
bite
thus
making
for
a
very
enjoyable
beverage
probably
the
best
quad
ive
ever
had
d
very
drinkable
slight
alcohol
only
serves
as
a
general
warning
on
this
bad
boy
i
enjoyed
this
beer
it
was
different
from
other
quads
ive
tried
i
did
find
it
a
bit
sweet
for
my
tastes
in
fact
cloying
at
times
but
aside
from
that
i
thought
it
was
wellconstructed
notes
session
beer
i
can
only
have
one
of
these
also
much
like
my
personal
experience
with
rochefort
the
middle
strength
version
of
koningshoven
the
triple
and
rochefort
8
were
my
favorite
the
stronger
versions
of
both
of
these
this
quad
and
rochefort
10
were
to
me
too
strong
in
both
cases
they
upset
the
wonderful
balance
of
their
less
strong
bretheren
koningshoven
quad
is
an
excellent
beer
i
am
only
indicating
that
i
prefer
the
tripel
taste
is
damn
strong
but
maybe
thats
just
because
i
was
going
on
a
relatively
empty
stomach
and
the
quad
was
my
first
beer
the
alcohol
is
definitely
in
your
face
with
this
one
but
after
the
initial
shock
the
true
flavors
come
through
tasty
rich
caramel
malts
and
sweetness
some
tartness
an
initial
bitterness
became
tame
as
the
drink
progressed
very
dark
fruity
flavors
a
sipper
for
sure
given
the
assertive
alcohol
on
this
one
mouthfeel
was
too
fizzy
for
me
overall
a
rare
and
interesting
brew
d
this
is
a
great
beer
and
a
very
good
quad
its
a
little
light
to
be
world
class
but
i
could
drink
it
all
night
long
beer
was
served
a
bit
too
chilled
i
felt
which
took
down
the
overall
experience
i
feel
i
need
to
give
this
another
tasting
as
the
potential
is
there
for
this
to
be
a
fantastic
quad
d
very
drinkable
high
abv
not
very
apparent
this
is
a
beer
that
i
will
be
definitely
having
again
drinkability
is
moderate
to
high
flavors
are
great
and
although
the
alcohol
is
high
it
fits
in
well
with
this
brew
it
is
certainly
a
really
nice
quad
enjoyable
beer
for
10
mouthfeel
is
velvety
smooth
it
just
coats
the
mouth
with
its
creamy
texture
really
cant
go
wrong
with
a
trappist
almost
a
mulled
wine
in
texture
flavour
nice
winter
sipper
dark
amber
colored
beer
with
a
rapidly
fading
head
aroma
is
alcohol
and
fruit
taste
is
warm
vanilla
oak
and
fruit
the
taste
reminds
me
of
the
sherry
you
would
add
to
snapper
soup
it
is
pricey
but
if
you
have
the
extra
cash
it
is
definetly
worth
a
try
d
a
very
solid
and
special
brew
maybe
one
for
a
special
occasion
went
down
easy
poured
into
tulip
glass
for
a
seethru
autumn
leave
body
with
a
booming
soapy
head
that
stuck
around
a
while
some
minor
citric
hops
in
there
especially
orange
plus
some
figs
cherries
bread
and
roasted
malts
with
caramel
and
toffee
along
with
some
dark
fruits
all
combined
in
a
very
potent
smell
this
beer
is
fullbodied
and
mixed
very
well
youll
get
not
only
a
good
malt
bite
like
caramel
coffee
maybe
some
chocolate
along
with
figs
and
some
pepper
spice
but
also
a
minor
cloying
hop
bite
on
the
end
although
it
does
go
down
smooth
with
a
little
alcohol
warming
on
the
end
plus
it
is
sticky
on
the
sides
a
tad
pricey
and
abv
limits
sessionability
but
this
was
still
a
great
quad
to
try
pours
a
beautiful
rich
dark
copperamberish
color
with
lots
of
floaties
a
thick
almond
head
rises
up
and
stands
at
full
attention
deflating
at
a
snails
pace
leaving
behind
some
thin
thready
lace
that
hangs
for
a
minute
or
two
before
disappearing
i
smell
strawberry
and
alcohol
upfront
some
yeast
and
damp
dirty
dungeon
aromas
as
wellim
using
my
imagination
a
littlei
love
it
dark
fruit
flavors
prunes
and
rasins
mostlylots
of
spicy
yeastiness
on
the
tail
end
a
tangy
bite
on
the
tounge
keeps
this
quad
rollin
strongclean
soft
finish
with
plenty
of
alcohol
warmth
to
spare
this
lil
bottle
is
what
great
beer
is
all
about
drinks
pretty
easy
for
the
style
abv
a
good
take
on
the
style
d
at
10
abv
its
nothing
to
take
too
lightly
better
have
a
meal
under
your
belt
first
md
full
body
and
medium
to
high
carbonation
feels
good
and
easy
going
down
poured
into
a
snifter
it
has
a
beautiful
dark
amber
body
with
just
a
bit
of
yeast
in
it
and
is
covered
by
an
off
white
head
thats
starts
off
about
two
fingers
thick
and
then
thins
out
into
a
thin
layer
of
bubbles
and
has
some
very
good
lacing
to
it
it
has
a
slightly
dry
alcohol
aroma
followed
by
some
floral
smells
and
a
bit
of
rum
as
well
it
smells
sweet
over
all
it
has
a
nice
clean
semicrisp
feel
to
it
with
a
mediumtolight
body
the
carbonation
really
hits
your
tongue
you
can
barley
taste
the
alcohol
in
it
and
it
is
quit
smooth
there
are
some
faint
malts
flavors
some
raisin
flavors
as
well
it
has
a
dry
aftertaste
thats
really
warms
up
your
mouth
this
is
clearly
a
sipping
brew
it
had
a
rather
reddish
color
to
it
and
smelled
mildly
yeastly
there
was
a
rich
maltiness
to
it
but
was
not
at
all
cloying
it
appeared
to
have
a
nice
balance
to
it
and
was
not
overpowering
but
again
i
found
myself
taking
only
small
sips
of
this
intense
quad
d
didnt
come
off
as
anything
unusual
or
exciting
i
enjoyed
it
but
not
enough
to
look
for
it
again
anytime
soon
finishing
the
bottle
was
easy
enough
poured
from
bottle
to
chimay
chalice
pours
amber
red
almost
mahogany
nice
thick
offwhite
head
with
good
retention
and
lacing
this
is
a
great
looking
beer
smell
is
good
pretty
much
what
id
expect
for
the
styles
some
yeast
bread
alcohol
and
dark
fruits
almost
like
a
fruity
red
wine
taste
didnt
do
it
for
me
though
it
wasnt
horrible
just
something
seemed
off
i
think
the
yeast
was
a
little
too
pronounced
and
it
had
a
stronger
than
expected
biscuit
flavor
the
alcohol
isnt
very
hidden
either
very
noticeable
mouthfeel
was
on
par
carbonation
was
perfect
overall
a
very
drinkable
beer
just
something
seemed
off
on
the
taste
i
really
enjoyed
this
quad
i
am
a
fan
of
the
style
and
will
continue
to
buy
it
with
this
one
in
the
top
five
it
is
hard
to
come
by
around
here
but
worth
the
trip
if
you
find
it
overall
not
my
favourite
quadrupel
but
very
good
at
first
glance
this
beer
is
very
pretty
in
the
glass
dark
ruby
it
looks
absolutely
amazing
almost
undrinkable
when
the
light
catches
it
what
a
nice
ruby
color
generated
a
very
nice
head
with
tight
bubbles
of
an
offwhite
hue
aroma
was
complex
with
red
wine
esters
bannanalike
yeast
alchohol
and
spice
very
smooth
and
warming
flavor
great
bitterness
to
balance
the
sugary
sweetness
of
the
beer
each
taste
brought
forth
new
impressions
and
flavors
the
alchohol
was
not
overpowering
but
quite
balanced
with
sweetness
and
bitterness
cant
wait
for
another
one
of
these
orange
color
with
a
small
foam
aroma
shows
a
touch
of
bubble
gum
and
light
fruits
powerful
flavors
of
raisins
rum
soaked
dark
fruits
honey
doughy
pastrylike
malts
with
lots
of
belgian
character
very
boozy
but
well
balaced
and
fairly
complex
hmm
nice
tasting
but
the
aroma
and
appearence
leave
a
lot
to
be
desired
this
is
a
fresh
batch
and
not
my
favorite
the
last
batch
i
sold
which
i
have
several
bottles
aging
was
amazing
this
is
a
nice
beer
but
not
a
batch
ill
be
collecting
i
really
didnt
like
this
beer
when
i
first
bought
it
last
year
but
after
letting
it
sit
for
a
while
its
much
better
the
taste
starts
boozey
syrupy
caramel
and
honey
sweetness
overipened
plums
figs
dates
pure
goodness
there
is
a
faint
spicy
alcohol
burn
in
the
finish
but
i
keep
being
drawn
back
to
that
fruity
overipened
deliciousness
this
is
a
fantastic
quad
a
sipper
def
will
be
buying
a
few
bottles
of
this
baby
for
aging
and
now
drinkability
a
nice
suprisingly
dry
fruity
finish
with
a
minute
plus
linger
a
true
sip
and
savor
masterpiece
lower
carbonation
and
a
sticky
chewy
mouthfeel
work
pretty
well
here
overall
it
was
a
little
less
complex
than
expected
but
it
was
good
wont
replace
my
st
bernardus
though
d
well
this
might
just
be
a
once
in
a
lifetime
beer
for
me
but
this
one
was
verry
drinkable
d
the
malt
character
is
nice
and
complex
but
i
would
like
it
to
be
a
bit
darker
with
some
more
intense
yeast
character
reasonably
drinkable
for
a
beer
of
this
weight
d
this
is
a
very
good
quad
its
worth
the
price
this
trappist
ale
pours
a
mahogany
color
with
a
creamy
beige
head
the
nose
has
bready
malts
tropical
fruits
and
spicy
yeast
the
taste
is
nicely
balanced
a
sweet
malt
and
fruit
presence
is
compimented
by
belgian
herbs
delicious
a
silky
body
goes
down
very
well
a
fantastic
belgian
style
quadruple
from
our
friends
in
the
netherlands
my
first
quadrupel
i
did
not
know
what
to
expect
but
this
is
an
exceptional
beer
something
that
i
will
enjoy
though
to
fully
appreciate
this
i
need
to
be
more
familiar
with
the
style
watching
the
red
sox
game
with
some
trappist
product
does
not
get
a
whole
lot
better
than
that

of
dark
fruit
fig
strawberry
and
date
with
some
mild
spice
taste
is
very
similar
to
the
smell
but
comes
to
life
moreso
with
the
carbonation
giving
it
a
slightly
metallic
taste
in
the
finish
alcohol
can
be
noticed
in
the
taste
but
it
isnt
too
hot
body
is
pretty
light
for
a
quad
which
is
a
nice
change
from
some
others
i
have
had
recently
so
far
this
one
glass
is
going
down
very
easily
so
im
sure
it
wont
be
too
difficult
to
finish
off
the
bottle
another
beautiful
graceful
belgian
trappist
beer
some
of
koningshoevens
brews
including
this
have
scored
very
high
with
my
friends
and
i
in
blind
trappist
tastings
even
beating
westvleteren
in
a
couple
of
cases
cheers
overall
this
is
definitely
not
a
beer
for
the
faint
of
heart
one
must
truly
be
able
to
appreciate
a
good
belgian
ale
to
find
love
in
this
beer
my
gf
tried
it
and
was
not
a
fan
more
for
me
excellently
balanced
in
taste
and
texture
with
a
light
alcoholic
kick
this
is
a
great
beer
for
an
afterdinner
conversation
well
worth
every
penny
and
disappears
way
too
quickly
i
tried
this
on
draught
on
april
11
2008
at
smokeless
joes
in
toronto
ontario
canada
the
beer
poured
a
dark
reddish
brown
with
a
thick
long
lasting
white
head
the
aroma
was
thick
with
yeast
and
some
sweet
caramel
malt
the
mouthfeel
was
thick
creamy
and
mildly
carbonated
the
flavour
was
brown
sugar
sweet
with
some
yeasty
hints
not
quite
as
sickly
sweet
as
a
samichlaus
of
hardys
pours
a
deep
and
clear
orangish
brown
with
a
decent
amount
of
creamy
tan
head
that
fades
away
fairly
quickly
leaving
a
thin
layer
on
top
smells
of
yeast
raisins
cinnamon
nutmeg
orange
flowers
very
complex
and
very
pleasant
the
taste
is
also
very
complex
and
pleasant
its
very
sweet
as
it
should
be
and
theres
chocolate
raisins
some
citrus
nuts
and
the
ethereal
alcohol
flavor
you
only
really
get
from
belgian
style
ales
mouthfeel
is
very
heavy
and
creamy
overall
its
very
drinkable
for
a
quadrupel
not
something
you
can
drink
all
day
but
for
a
special
occasion
its
an
awesome
beer
drinkability
sure
go
for
it
good
trappist
product
support
them
monks
mouthfeel
is
full
bodied
very
smooth
and
creamy
this
is
a
damn
fine
beer
a
slow
drinker
for
sure
but
i
looked
forward
to
every
sip
overall
this
definately
makes
it
in
my
top
10
the
dutch
trappists
know
their
stuff
you
do
need
a
sweet
tooth
for
this
one
in
my
case
it
left
me
highly
satisfied
and
despite
its
price
i
will
definately
have
it
again

i
love
it
but
its
a
special
treat
so
i
treat
it
like
one
d
slightly
drinkable
to
moderate
drinkability
because
of
the
sweet
taste
and
alcohol
d
i
didnt
get
much
from
this
quad
except
a
good
buzz
but
i
would
try
it
again
if
only
to
see
how
the
flavor
changes
from
bottle
to
bottle
or
batch
to
batch
i
enjoyed
la
trappes
dubbel
far
more
than
this
quad
drinkability
was
great
at
first
but
sweetness
gets
a
touch
tiresome
as
the
bottle
empties
very
good
though
and
i
will
definitely
try
again
d
not
so
good
could
barely
finish
the
halfpint
it
was
so
strong
this
poured
a
hazy
light
brown
with
light
tan
head
it
had
a
barely
noticeable
mild
malt
scent
it
tasted
like
roasted
wheat
and
malt
with
a
nice
hops
bitterness
and
slight
alcohol
burn
it
was
pretty
thick
with
no
carbonation
and
had
a
strong
sweet
and
bitter
aftertaste
overall
this
was
actually
the
easiest
koningshoeven
to
drink
and
it
was
definitely
my
favorite
of
the
trio
even
still
this
wasnt
that
spectacular
at
10
its
no
wonder
dinteresting
bottle
that
changes
as
it
warms
enjoyed
sipping
this
one
as
the
complexity
and
smoothness
are
more
aparent
as
it
warms
but
didnt
think
it
was
spectacular
would
drink
again
but
wouldnt
seek
it
out
definitely
a
great

whats
not
to

here
not
much
in
the
way
of
the

i
was
rooting
you
bourbon
cheap
rubberplastic
cork
provided
which
i
could
barely
pull
out
for
such
a
highly
esteemed
brewery
surprised
at
how
flat
this
is
a
pleasant
quaff
nonetheless
very
easy
drinking
but
has
this
quad
fully
succeeded
the
intention
i
was
expecting
more
for
the
money
spent
but
oh
well
overall
a
ho
hum
quad
and
a
basic
meh
overall
its
a
great
beer
im
glad
i
got
the
opportunity
to
try
it
i
will
say
that
the
17
99
i
paid
for
the
beer
is
not
something
i
would
be
willing
to
put
down
again
but
i
dont
regret
it
definitely
going
to
be
towards
the
top
of
my
list
of
belgian

a

maybe
even

hurts
overall

still
delicious

batch

is
very
smokey
and
peaty
which
overpowers
the
beer
when
i
have
a
chance
to
try
another
batch
i
will
update
my
review
enjoyed
batch

16
to
date
batch
10
was
fantastic
lots
of
oak
mellowed
the
alcohol
burn
and
reminded
me
of
a
very
well
aged
westy
12
batch
16
still
had
a
significant
burn
from
the
higher
abv
have
a
few
more
batches
im
really
looking
forward
to
enjoying
in
the
coming
months
worth
the
higher
precise
tab
i
realize
my
rating
may
be
considered
a
bit
stingy
but
i
am
drinking
this
without
any
consideration
given
to
the
la
trappe
label
or
the
high
price
of
this
beer
it
is
afterall
still
a
drink
and
unfortunately
this
one
just
isnt
very
good
sip
and
enjoy
o
this
wonderful
tweak
to
a
classic
presents
a
beautiful
bouquet
of
lush
dark
fruit
complexities
so
common
to
the
quad
style
while
bringing
complimentary
subtle
vanilla
notes
from
the
toasted
oak
barrels
and
bourbon
whiskeylike
spice
that
equally
compliments
the
belgian
yeast
undertones
a
bit
thinner
than
its
counterpart
this
version
smells
and
tastes
like
its
heavier
on
the
alcohol
while
remaining
the
same
complex
though
much
of
the
nuance
to
the
beer
is
lost
to
the
age
its
a
fantastic
beer
nonetheless
overall
the
cage
broke
when
i
tried
to
open
the
bottle
i
had
to
use
channel
lock
pliers
to
get
the
cork
out
aisde
from
this
i
really
enjoyed
this

on

there
is
a

on

with
each

this
beer
has
a
low

an
almost

overall
this
is
a
good
beer
with
fantastic

and
tasty
but
slightly
oxidized

d
a
bit
boozy
but
i
like
it
the
cognac
adds
a
nice
touch
overall
an
excellent
example
of
an
oak

brew
highly
recommended

not

if
its

so

just
wish
it

overall
a
nice
beer
in

quadrupel
o
overall
id
say
its
a
very
nice
beer
just
not
an
exceptional
quad
it
excels
in
simplicity
and
delicateness
the
most
prominent
flavor
is
alcohol
personally
i
would
have
liked
a
more
complex
and
flavorful
beer
for
a
beer
with
oak
in
the
title
i
would
have
liked
some
oak
influence
in
the
flavor
and
aroma
its
not
something
i
would
probably
buy
again
because
it
just
wasnt
memorable
enough

wells
me
we
are
very
lucky
to
acquire
batch
3
of
this
project
over
50
percent
of
the
barrelaged
blend
comes
from
port
barrels
and
the
rest
is
aged
on
other
variations
of
toasted
oak
being
that
we
are
fond
of
the
traditional
quad
this
is
a
real
treat
all
around
with
results
like
this
we
hope
this
project
does
not
see
delay
this
beer
was
a
nice
choice
to
aged
in
oak
adds
a
nice
smoothness
and
seems
to
balance
the
flavors
a
little
bit
complex
and
tasty
but
i
think
i
enjoyed
the
nonaged
version
just
a
little
more
o
certainly
a
good
beer
it
could
probably
use
612
months
to
let
the
alcohol
heat
fade
a
bit
the
quad
and
whiskey
flavors
already
complement
each
other
fairly
well
overall
a
good
beer
pricey
but
interesting
if
youre
looking
for
a
twist
on
the
traditional
quad
o
wow
the
aromas
are
amazing
an
it
is
a
great
quad
that
can
be
sipped
slowly
with
delight
love
it
and
highly
recommend
enjoy
overall
this
is
an
awesome
beer
the
quadbourbon
combination
is
interesting
and
works
quite
well
here
i
am
very
interested
to
try
some
of
the
other
barrel
blends
as
they
sound
very
interesting
while
this
beer
is
a
bit
on
the
pricey
side
it
is
well
worth
the
occassional
splurge
overall
i
was
very
let
down
not
often
i
get
a
bad
beer
15
99
down
the
drain
although
i
did
drink
it
just
suffered
through
it
because
i
could
not
pour
it
out
o
really
liked
this
one
im
a
fan
of
quads
anyway
but
the
aging
and
the
port
oak
make
this
a
subtle
and
complex
beer
o
other
than
the
light
amount
of
warming
in
the
finish
the
alcohol
is
relatively
well
hidden
in
this
big
beer
the
mouthfeel
lacks
the
stickiness
and
the
flavors
are
not
nearly
as
sweet
as
some
of
the
others
in
the
quad
style
making
this
one
a
little
easier
to
drink
much
different

better

generally

like

love
belgian
ales
this
one
was
a
big
disappointment
for
me
the
cork
was
made
of
some
plastic
that
was
very
difficult
to
remove
i
had
to
use
a
16
set
of
knipex
pliers
once
i
got
past
this
issue
i
was
excited
about
the
pour
but
disappointed
that
there
was
not
even
a
millimeter
of
foam
this
was
seriously
deficient
in
carbonation
for
me
i
almost
wanted
to
throw
it
out
and
drink
something
else
i
did
get
through
it
and
the
taste
was
not
so
bad
as
it
had
complexity
and
flavor
going
for
it
it
didnt
look
pretty
to
me
in
a
tulip
glass
too
thick
no
bubbles
looked
like
flat
cola
to
me
i
havent
seen
any
batch
11
reviews
here
so
i
thought
this
might
add
to
the
many
reviews
could
be
batch
11
is
particularly
bad
this
beer
is
phenomenal
it
may
be
a
bit
pricey
for
its
size
i
paid
17
for330ml
but
what
it
lacks
in
frugality
it
makes
up
for
in
taste
if
you
want
to
go
the
safe
route
this
pairs
very
well
with
smoked
meats
bbqanything
along
with
grilled
vegetables
and
smoked
fish
this
is
an

in

even
for

i
was

a

more

there
is
enough
to
satisfy
o
fully

palettes
accustomed

fine

good

pairings
will
find
even
more
to
like
here
than
i
did
its
very

and
avoids
the
syrupiness
of
which
some
quads
are
accused
only
westy
beats
it
in
this
regard
if
you
prefer
bitterness
or
even
just
slight
bitterness
id
avoid
it
overall
this
beer
is
a
great
beer
not
one
of
my
favorites
i
would
rather
have
st
bernardus
and
would
purchase
it
over
this
beer
9
times

not
saying
this

is

just
doesnt

into

pours
a
deep
mahogany
with
a
pop
of
fizz
that
completely
dissipates
in
about
a
minute
or
less
burying
your
nose
in
the
tulip
gives
a
really
nice
inviting
aroma
that
hides
the
alcohol
of
a
10
0
beer
you
get
the
typical
date
fig
sweetness
of
a
quad
quaffing
it
yields
an
unbelievably
mellow
flavor
and
since
this
is
not
one
of
the
older
variations
the
oak
aging
seems
to
have
done
a
trick
i
didnt
get
any
alcohol
burn
until
it
got
all
the
way
to
my
stomach
likely
as
a
result
of
not
having
eaten
in
a
while
otherwise
this
is
super
silky
smooth
i
didnt
know
that
this
was
made
with
malbec
wine
casks
until
i
went
to
look
up
some
details
due
to
catching
a
tannic
taste
from
my
red
wine
drinking
days
my
suspicions
were
confirmed
online
it
has
a
pretty
light
body
and
was
not
as
thick
as
i
thought
or
wanted
it
to
be
however
the
overall
flavor
was
excellent
and
im
glad
i
popped
the
cork
on
this
before
the
weather
got
too
warm
overall
i
like
this
beer
and
i
feel
that
it
is
worth
the
price
given
the
experience
given
by
the
addition
of
oak
and
wine
the
most
impressive
aspect
is
the
nose
but
i
felt
the
mouth
was
just
a
little
more
flat
than
what
i
was
hoping
for
o
for
an
oak
aged
beer
the
oak
could
have
been
more
present
the
cost
was
too
expansive
to
warrant
a
purchase
maybe
if
a
fresh
batch
came
out
it
would
be
worth
another
try
the
beer
looks
like
blood
and
has
a
mild
feel
of
sand
how
fitting
then
to
say
as
in
the
sam
raimi
spartacus
series
blood
and
sand
or
as
mat
cauthon
from
the
wheel
of
time
would
say
even
more
apropos
blood
and
bloody
ashes
as
a
curse
as
this
beer
tastes
like
ashes
3
25
d
its
an
easy
drink
but
it
doesnt
have
enough
quality
in
the
taste
or
mouthfeel
to
justify
paying
15
for
it
give
it
a
try
if
you
must
id
suggest
this
could
age
well
for
at
least
three
more
years
good
with
desserts
and
cigars
picked
this
up
at
my
favorite
beer
store
in
belgium
dranken
geers
batch
5
white
wine
barrels
surprising
murky
dark
brown
color
an
aggressive
pour
yielded
almost
no
head
or
lacing
big
woody
nose
with
tons
of
butterscotch
and
oak
along
with
hints
of
bubblegum
vanilla
dark
fruits
and
just
a
touch
of
vinous
notes
the
oak
is
dominant
in
the
taste
as
well
but
with
much
more
of
the
white
wine
character
emerging
from
the
barrels
also
getting
hints
of
caramel
vanilla
booze
butterscotch
brown
sugar
and
just
a
faint
touch
of
chocolate
on
the
finish
the
mouthfeel
has
very
low
carbonation
almost
to
the
point
where
it
seems
flat
but
not
in
a
bad
way
slightly
syrupy
with
a
subtle
warming
alcohol
burn
on
the
finish
overall
a
fantastic
beer
but
i
prefer
the
isidor
oak
aged
o
i
really
like
this
even
though
i
wish
there
was
some
kind
of
carbonation
for
some
body
backing
or
cleaning
up
the
palate
bit
as
this
is
the
flavors
are
huge
and
the
barrel
has
differently
turn
this
base
quad
into
a
very
complex
leveled
beer
i
wanna
try
another
just
to
make
sure
im
not
crazy
and
this
just
in
after
opening
and
writing
review
i
noted
that
this
was
not
just
the
quad
this

it

years
on

little

almost
a
cross
between

and

with
a
nice
large

residual

taste
is
also
dominated
by
some
wood
notes
with
light
residual
sugar
notes
and
dry
raisins
body
is
about
average
with
good
carbonation
and
no
apparent
alcohol
interesting
experiment
but
i
believe
the
regular
version
is
probably
better
then
this
barrelaged
version
and
the
white
wine
notes
where
quite
hard
to
distinguish
overall
i
was
excited
for
this
but
its
too
sweet
and
not
fruity
enough
the
oak
doesnt
mask
the
missing
flavors
in
fact
the
oak
makes
it
seem
sweeter
perhaps
im
being
too
critical
i
still
enjoy
drinking
it
but
i
was
expecting
more
probably
because
i
had
a
rochefort
10
the
night
before
nothing
compares
o
thisnisna
very
tasty
brew
the
red
wine
barrells
really
complimen
the
quad
base
excellently
very
nicley
done
o
excellent
complexity
and
balance
of
flavors
very
fruity
smooth
and
easy
drinking
especially
for
a
10
quad
barrel
treatment
pushes
everything
up
a
notch
from
the
base
beer
making
it
a
slight
improvement
everywhere
overall
an
astonishing
beer
with
an
incredibly
complex
flavor
definitely
commands
your
attention
from
the
moment
it
enters
the
glass
until
the
moment
you
take
the
last
sip
lovers
of
quads
should
seek
this
out
but
try
to
find
it
at
a
reasonable
price
and
check
the
batch
number
on
the
konigshoeven
website
to
see
what
kinds
of
barrels
were
used
make
sure
it
wont
have
any
flavors
that
you
yourself
find
objectionable
la
trappe
quadrupel
barrique
is
a
remarkably
complex
beer
that
was
all
too
easy
to
drink
while
the
oakiness
was
subtle
it
combined
with
the
two
years
of
aging
lent
a
good
deal
of
flavor
complexity
from
what
i
remember
this
beer
had
a
much
more
interesting
flavor
profile
than
the
nonoak
aged
version
i
tried
a
few
years
back
while
this
is
ounce
for
ounce
one
of
the
priciest
trappist
ale
available
it
is
definitely
worth
trying
o
wow
this
is
good
easy
to
drink
for
sure
othis
is
an
odd
quad
never
had
the
regular
version
but
i
am
anticipating
it
i
think
itll
be
a
lot
better
the
smoke
flavor
to
this
beer
isnt
well
received
on
my
part
its
definitely
a
lot
more
drinkable
though
than
a
lot
of
other
quads
its
very
smooth
wish
it
were
a
smaller
bottle
though
pours
a
murky
dark
hazelnut
with
a
few
ruby
highlights
with
a
nice
lasting
offwhite
creamy
head
nose
is
molasses
prunes
dates
candi
sugars
a
little
port
some
alcohol
taste
is
an
initial
light
sweetness
transitioning
to
quite
a
heavy
sweetness
in
the
middle
and
finish
palate
is
medium
to
full
verging
on
the
syrupy
yet
with
lively
carbonation
which
makes
it
a
joy
to
sip
more
warming
alcohol
stewed
fruits
biscuity
malt
and
cinnamon
sugars
in
the
long
finish
i
like
this
beer
a
lot
i
find
it
to
be
very
tasty
its
too
bad
it
is
so
expensive
as
it
is
one
of
the
more
enjoyable
quads
ive
had
lately
id
love
to
buy
a
bunch
of
bottles
but
i
dont
think
its
in
the
budget
thats
ok
though
this
will
remain
a
treat
to
look
forward
to
this
beer
is
recommended
to
any
fan
of
trappist
beers
or
other
belgian
ales
o
excellent
beer
i
have
had
this
before
fresh
and
i
am
glad
i
aged
a
couple
of
bottles
if
you
like
a
belgian
style
quad
with
a
different
take
find
one
of
these
batches
i
am
glad
i
got
the
13
as
a
red
wine
fan
overall
really
unique
quad
the
barrel
notes
are
really
prominent
in
this
beer
not
quite
to
style
as
far
as
a
quad
is
concerned
not
as
fruity
as
i
would
like
to
see
this
beer
i
did
like
it
though
i
would
say
it
going
to
get
better
with
some
age
those
barrel
notes
need
to
mellow
out
a
little
bit
i
would
definitely
recommend
this
beer
to
others
especially
fans
of
belgians
one
of
the
more
interesting
beers
ive
tried
recently
overall
very
good
i
think
that
the
regular
la
trappe
quad
is
a
good
beer
but
overly
sweet
this
solves
that
problem
a
really
nice
use
of
the
barrel
tasty
overall
a
decided
winner
fantastic
beer
my
one
real
criticism
aside
from
the
wallet
hit
would
probably
be
that
the
whiskey
is
almost
too
dialed
it
i
would
prefer
it
scaled
back
just
a
bit
but
the
whiskey
component
is
a
unique
tasty
twist
on
the
style
not
to
be
missed
especially
for
quad
fans
o
so
different
than
most
quads
but
i
wouldnt
change
anything
o
a
very
deep
rich
and
complex
beer
the
barrel
presence
on
this
is
nice
but
the
whiskey
character
could
stand
to
mellow
a
bit
i
think
this
will
get
better
with
timeage
but
fun
to
enjoy
now
as
well
o
excellent
beautiful
beer
i
was
not
expecting
that
much
o
i
really
enjoyed
this
offering
i
felt
that
the
barrels
added
a
nice
layer
of
complexity
to
an
otherwise
standard
quad
not
that
the
barrel
integration
was
perfectly
done
but
more
of
an
enhancement
that
stood
out
above
the
base
beer
batch
7
is
blended
in
june
2011
and
is
the
first
batch
of
two
that
has
matured
in
old
whiskey
barrels
these
barrels
come
from
different
whiskey
distilleries
such
as
bowmore
tamdhu
strathspey
and
laphroaig
johnstons
the
aromas
of
the
whiskeys
have
an
obvious
impact
on
the
final
flavor
this
flavor
is
remarkable
and
clearly
different
from
those
of
previous
batches
peat
and
burnt
are
more
present
while
wood
and
wood
tannins
are
less
obvious
to
spot
but
the
warming
effect
of
the
full
robust
flavor
the
whiskey
barrels
passed
on
to
our
already
beautiful
quadrupel
makes
this
batch
maybe
even
the
most
tasty
brewed
to
date
batch
9
and
batch
1
should
be
the
best
until
now
nice
beer
pretty
complex
and
some
interesting
changes
as
it
warms
i
cant
believe
the
wonderful
mouth
feel

i

and
it
may
be
a

on
the
cloying
sweet
side
an
enjoyable
quad
but
at
the
price
i
would
buy
one
of
the
others
out
there
very
interesting
and
flavorful
flavor
is
pleasant
and
unified
i
would
be
happy
to
pick
this
up
again
this
is
a
very
unique
tasting
quad
never
had
anything
like
it
this
is
from
wine
barrels
wow
shocking
fabulous
beer
overall
this
was
a
little
too
boozy
for
me
not
my
favorite
of
the
quads
but
i
can
understand
the
appeal
of
this
for
others
i
didnt
know
anything
about
this
beer
before
i
opened
it
probably
should
have
let
it
cellar
for
a
year
or
so
this
is
a
medium
bodied
brew
with
a
modest
level
of
carbonation
it
is
big
and
enjoyable
with
a
pleasant
balance
of
character
the
oak
was
not
overly
done
in
fact
it
was
pleasantly
subtle
and
really
worked
as
a
background
nuance
that
made
for
a
top
shelf
experience
this
is
a
solid
example
that
is
worth
checking
out
this
ranks
right
up
there
will
all
the
other
quads
that
get
a
lot
more
fame
and
attention

just
enough
and

feels

delicate
despite
what
it
is
overall
one
of
the
best
belgians
in
the
world
as
far
as
i
am
concerned
i
could
drink
this
nectar
every
day
and
be
a
very
happy

i

its

not
great
beer
at
14
99
a
bottle
i
probably
wouldnt
buy
it
again
but
even
then
i
still
think
its
worth
trying
one
of
the
mildest
uses
of
oak
aging
ive
come
across
if
you
were
expecting
some
big
vanilla
or
wine
notes
you
wont
find
them
here
maybe
the
barrel
was
going
neutral
by
the
time
it
was
filled
with
beer
this
bottle
is
over
a
year
old
but
in
my
experience
barrel
flavors
dont
really
mellow
over
time
the
yeast
character
and
sweet
malt
are
the
primary
flavors
i
dont
know
that
it
delivers
the
goods
for
the
price
15
per
375
but
it
is
a
good
beer
i
feel
a
bit
let
down
but
ive
never
been
the
biggest
la
trappe
fan
anyway
pretty
awesome
o
like
i
said
a
beautiful
attempt
to
make
something
good
even
better
i
really
like
this
beer
but
i
must
say
that
it
is
nowhere
near
its
price
tag
17
for
12
7
oz
id
rather
go
with
a
full
750
of
regular
la
trappe
quad
for
6
cheaper
this
is
still
a
great
beer
but
its
hard
to
notice
the
oak
aging
and
its
cost
is
not
really
worth
it
i
will
enjoy
the
hell
out
of
the
rest
of
it
though
very
smooth
mouthfeel
with
light
to
medium
carbonation
slightly
bitter
up
front
but
leads
way
to
a
very
mellow
sweetness
of
the
aforementioned
fruits
and
some
other
malt
sweetness
batch
6
is
good
as
well
white
wine
is
kind
of
an
interesting
choice
but
the
sweetness
gets
balanced
by
the
smokiness
in
7
and
the
drynessvinuous
tart
character
from
the
white
wine
in
6
decent
lacing
too
the
dryness
and
sweetness
kinda
clash
and
its
a
bit
rough
feeling
like
sandpaper
tongue
but
not
bad
overall
this
is
a
great
beer
well
worth
the
money
the
blending
and
the
oak
presence
is
well
balanced
as
is
the
taste
i
would
gladly
buy
another
bottle
of
this
one
cheers
overall
i
drank
this
beer
immediately
after
having
a
la
trappe
quad
and
as
i
said
above
it
is
truly
its
own
animal
honestly
i
prefer
their
standard
quad
as
there
is
more
diversity
in
flavor
this
one
was
dominated
by
the
port
cant
believe
my
little
liquor
store
carried
this
at
20
00
this
is
super
pricey
but
well
worth
it
the
best
trappist
beer
or
for
that
matter
belgian
style
made
in
holland
beer
ive
had
its
a
shame
the
bros
havent
tried
this
yet
this
one
would
be
a
real
cellar
stocker
if
not
for
the
high
price
tag
d
this
is
a
very
unusual
beer
especially
coming
from
a
trappist
brewery
i
have
been
happy
to
see
la
trappe
branching
out
recently
and
doing
some
new
and
unusual
beers
this
one
is
probably
the
best
of
their
experimental
beers
that
i
have
tried
so
far
the
barrel
aging
adds
some
really
interesting
flavors
and
the
port
character
in
particular
works
very
nicely
with
the
base
beer
got
my
hands
on
a
bottle
while
the
ginger
man
in
midtown
nyc
dark
pour
with
forward
aromas
head
retains
itself
well
after
pour
the
oak
is
not
overpowering
a
good
complement
to
the
dark
sugars
in
the
beer
the
alcohol
doesnt
bite
to
hard
at
the
tongue
as
in
other
higher
alcohol
beers
do
overall
a
great
drink
that
i
would
recommend
to
someone
into
oakaged
brews
pours
a
moderatelydark
brown
with
a
bit
of
a
mahogany
hue
to
it
large
foamy
head
with
good
retention
and
nice
lacing
the
nose
brings
forward
plenty
of
dark
fruit
and
a
bit
of
booze
faint
dark
sugar
and
molasses
plus
a
bit
of
oak
good
fruit
and
sweetness
character
in
the
flavor
to
balance
the
oak
medium
to
full
body
with
a
nice
barrel
presence
tasty
brew
o
good
but
my
least
favorite
for
its
style
i
can
only
spare
myself
the
aggravation
by
never
buying
another
one
till
a
different
stopper
is
used
the
effort
to
remove
the
cork
crosses
into
stupidity
my
taste
changed
a
lot
or
this
beer
actually
lost
from
aging
overall
i
think
this
was
a
nice
play
on
a
traditional
quad
the
oak
gave
it
a
nice
finish
but
wasnt
overpowering
a
very
complex
beer
that
is
up
there
on
my
list
of
favorites
a
bit
on
the
pricey
side
though
as
i
can
get
2
rochefort
10s
for
about
what
i
paid
for
this
one
overall
this
is
a
fresh
batch
and
is
drinking
extremely
well
right
now
i
will
probably
try
to
grab
a
few
more
bottles
to
throw
in
the
cellar
and
bust
out
on
special
occasions
like
the
next
chicago
sports
championship
minus
the
cubs
obviously
or
something
like
that
even
at
20
i
would
not
pass
this
up
if
you
have
the
chance
to
try
it
a
no
doubt
top
20
beer
for
me
a
tremendous
oakaged
version
of
a
fantastic
quad
i
would
love
to
try
this
one
again
and
again
and
again
o
a
little
spendy
but
definitely
worth
it
now
and
then
i
havent
had
many
quads
recently
and
beers
like
this
really
make
me
wonder
why
ive
ignored
many
of
these
will
definitely
snag
more
of
these
if
i
see
them
overall
an
excellent
beer
and
one
i
may
seek
out
again
pours
an
exquisite
and
hazy
deep
amber
not
much
head
but
a
good
amount
of
lacing
smells
of
grapes
oak
and
caramel
then
theres
the
taste
sweet
malt
a
nudge
of
bitter
hops
then
a
familiar
unctuous
feel
and
flavor
that
reveals
the
oak
aging
full
creamy
round
mouthfeel
without
being
heavy
the
10
abv
warms
on
the
way
down
but
doesnt
overpower
any
of
the
magnificent
flavors
unsurprisingly
it
becomes
more
complex
and
the
flavors
bolder
as
it
warms
o
one
of
my
favorite
beers
i
have
had
wonderful
complexity
to
this
beer
o
overall
the
oak
adds
a
lot
of
complexity
to
the
beer
the
smells
and
flavors
certainly
have
been
altered
from
the
barrel
aging
but
these
barrels
and
this
beer
are
not
a
match
made
in
heaven
and
i
really
wonder
if
any
barrel
aging
can
improve
this
classic
quad
which
is
one
of
the
few
that
defines
the
style
for
me
the
original
is
not
boozy
at
all
in
my
opinion
and
the
barrel
aging
really
brings
out
the
booze
perhaps
with
time
this
would
be
a
gem
definitely
a
solid
beer
and
worth
checking
out
if
you
are
a
fan
of
barrel
aged
brews
andor
quads
id
be
interested
to
try
some
of
the
batches
that
use
toastier
woods
an
enjoyable
quad
a
bit
more
barrel
character
and
this
would
be
excellent
this
is
very
good
anyway
something
i
like
and
would
recommend
overall
this
is
a
fairly
drinkable
beer
it
is
primarily
hindered
by
the
booziness
of
the
drink
components
are
solid
with
a
bit
too
much
bite
to
drink
a
lot
of
this
is
a
very
impressive
belgian
dark
i
can
put
it
right
up
with
my
top
3
favorites
in
the
style
if
you
run
across
it
get
it
opretty
goddamn
good
will
cellar
a
few
of
these
in
the
echelon
of
westvleteren
suck
on
that
hairy
armpit
ladies
almost
gave
this
beer
straight
5s
had
to
sit
back
and
think
about
it
so
easy
to
get
carried
away
when
a
beer
is
this
good
overall
an
exceptional
beer
the
oak
aging
creates
a
smoothness
and
a
bit
of
sweet
flavor
hard
to
find
this
beer
but
worth
the
effort
go
get
some
o
very
good
beer
but
i
felt
it
was
a
tad
bit
of
a
let
down
none
the
less
a
good
beer
but
not
great
o
a
pretty
interesting
take
on
some
oak
aging
a
solid
beer
but
just
not
in
the
same
league
as
the
others
in
the
list
finished
9
of
10
batch
3
was
lost
on
the
potluck
of
ageing
very
boozy
not
greatly
drinkable
o
so
smooth
not
too
sweet
or
too
alcoholy
the
nose
was
amazing
easily
the
best
part
apart
from
the
taste
a
pretty
perfect
beer
all
around
theres
not
much
that
i
would
change
about
this
od
nice
quad
i
couldnt
tell
if
i
liked
it
better
than
the
original
but
it
was
enjoyable
complex
tasty
and
no
noticable
alcohol
overall
the
tamest
most
non
memorable
trappist
that
i
have
had
if
there
was
a
style
to
tie
it
to
i
would
call
it
a
session
trappist
but
this
beer
underdelivers
for
being
a
15
bottle
disappointed
yes
this
was
a
very
expensive
beer
i
paid
14
euro
for
a
single
bottle
but
it
was
a
real
treat
well
good
but
a
bit
disappointing
the
sweetness
just
dominates
with
a
whip
a
heel
everything
else
slinks
around
trying
to
avoid
notice
good
brew
but
i
was
hoping
for
a
bit
more
distinction
in
the
oaking
overall
i
enjoyed
this
brew
for
sure
while
the
nose
was
a
little
less
interesting
and
the
palate
a
little
flatter
the
taste
profile
was
quite
intriguing
as
a
quad
fan
this
oak
aged
version
blended
the
barrel
with
the
base
quad
quite
well
but
consequently
muted
the
base
quad
slightly
in
order
to
make
room
for
the
barrel
la
trappe
quad
is
a
very
bold
and
flavorful
brew
so
its
not
surprising
that
the
barrel
had
to
make
room
for
itself
somewhere
regardless
this
is
the
first
barrel
aged
trappist
to
my
knowledge
and
based
on
how
enjoyable
this
one
was
i
hope
we
see
some
ba
rochefort
10
and
westvleteren
12
soon
enough
well
done
la
trappe
cheers
overall
i
enjoyed
this
beer
very
much
i
had
high
expectations
going
in
and
they
were
exceeded
if
you
love
this
brewery
like
do
or
belgian
quads
in
general
i
highly
recommend
seeking
out
this
beer
excellent
i
had
some
severe
high
hopes
that
this
was
going
to
be
better
than
the
regular
version
but
i
beleive
that
the
orginal
is
still
better
this
beer
pours
out
very
similar
to
the
regular
quad
its
basically
the
same
brown
color
this
one
might
be
a
little
easier
to
see
through
and
the
head
is
much
thinner
here
the
aroma
is
a
little
bit
let
fruity
and
more
wooden
which
makes
sense
but
i
was
hoping
that
some
of
those
fruit
aromas
would
have
been
preserved
in
here
there
a
slightly
sweet
and
sour
aroma
coming
off
it
as
well
i
dont
really
get
vanilla
though
the
taste
has
a
little
bit
of
vanilla
but
its
not
nearly
as
lively
as
the
original
version
this
beer
has
a
similar
mouthfeel
but
less
bubbly
overall
both
are
wonderful
brews
but
i
feel
that
you
can
save
a
crap
load
of
money
and
just
stick
to
the
original
version
notes
this
beer
is
super
sweet
and
getting
into
the
cloying
territory
i
would
have
like
more
wood
tannin
or
some
extra
hops
to
bring
balance
back
to
this
beer
i
do
appreciate
the
uniqueness
of
the
style
and
dig
that
it
came
from
a
trappist
brewery
thanks
to
schmittymack
for
bringing
this
one
over
a
week
ago
poured
from
the
cool
little
375
into
an
odell
glass
pours
a
lightly
hazy
amber
color
with
a
good
white
head
aromas
of
light
oak
dark
fruits
plums
figs
dates
and
caramel
medium
bodied
with
dried
fruits
raisins
and
toffee
d
an
awesome
quad
a
beer
that
is
usually
fairly
rich
to
begin
with
the
oak
aging
really
puts
this
on
a
whole
other
level
of
richness
and
strength
for
the
style
this
is
a
damn
tasty
beer
tastes
like
it
smells
but
with
burnt
sugar
hints
of
maple
walnut
black
truffel
and
black
tea
really
datey
and
pruney
the
oak
is
nice
adds
a
soft
round
mouthfeel
to
the
beer
as
well
as
some
tannin
from
the
wood
a
good
bit
of
vanilla
on
the
finish
really
helps
the
drinkability
and
keeps
the
10
at
bay
delicious
beer
o
a
unique
take
on
a
quad
with
the
barrel
treatment
takes
it
away
from
quad
territory
and
almost
into
the
old
ale
realm
well
that
was
a
bit
of
a
disappointment
the
barrelaging
adds
a
bit
of
interest
but
the
underlying
brew
just
doesnt
have
the
complexity
of
other
toptier
quads
it
was
at
least
interesting
with
some
parmesan
snagged
this
bottle
up
at
julios
tonight
on
my
way
home
poured
in
to
a
snifter
the
color
is
a
nice
rose
with
a
ring
of
lace
and
tiny
chunks
of
yeast
floating
here
and
there
the
smell
is
of
peach
nectar
honey
alcohol
and
stone
fruit
taste
is
pretty
damn
close
to
the
nose
with
a
nice
lively
carbonation
the
oak
barrel
aging
is
apparent
but
not
too
over
the
top
same
with
the
alcohol
definitely
noticeable
but
not
overkill
interesting
to
see
a
trappist
brewery
use
barrel
aging
la
trappe
quad
is
one
of
my
favorites
from
the
monks
anyway
wish
i
had
a
bottle
of
regular
quad
to
compare
either
way
damn
tasty
this
one
is
decentlyhot
like
a
typical
la
trappe
quad
but
a
bit
more
rounded
from
the
barrels
and
the
length
of
the
aging
though
served
january
29
2011
pours
a
murky
reddish
brown
small
head
that
diminished
down
to
a
lingering
ring
smell
actually
reminds
me
of
a
sweet
red
wine
very
fruity
some
oaky
wine
notes
pretty
interesting
and
quite
nice
taste
of
this
one
is
very
smooth
the
oak
is
pretty
subtle
and
the
year
in
the
barrel
has
no
doubt
mellowed
this
one
out
quite
a
bit
definitely
some
tannic
wine
qualities
along
with
some
fruity
estery
flavors
it
finishes
with
a
slight
bitterness
and
a
lingering
wine
taste
the
mouthfeel
is
a
little
lighter
than
i
would
hope
but
the
lower
carbonation
level
works
pretty
well
i
would
say
the
drinkability
is
pretty
high
but
with
a
quality
brew
like
this
i
am
taking
my
time
overall
this
beer
is
definitely
an
interesting
take
on
the
original
i
would
love
to
try
all
the
different
batches
a
little
pricey
but
a
unique
and
tasty
brew
the
beer
feels
a
little
raw
but
the
oak
adds
another
layer
of
flavor
and
works
well
with
the
style
the
oak
is
strong
in
this
one
overall
its
a
pretty
good
beer
though
the
huge
banana
character
was
unexpected
and
not
very
quadlike
this
is
pretty
good
but
i
cant
recommend
for
the
price
way
to
expensive
especially
when
you
dont
really
taste
a
barrel
aged
quad
d
can
i
buy
more
please
i
have
one
more
to
cellar
but
i
will
clearly
need
more
of
this
greatness
cheers
could
drink
this
all
night
for
the
first
time
when
discussing
a
koningshoeven
beer
can
i
begin
to
talk
about
some
of
the
finer
intangibles
that
separate
trappist
ales
from
most
abbey
ales
notice
that
any
mention
of
oakaging
is
slight
as
this
character
does
a
great
job
of
smoothening
the
beer
and
adding
subtle
complexity
without
overstating
it
although
the
alcohol
could
exercise
some
restraint
in
mouthfeel
the
beer
has
the
magical
sweetness
in
taste
that
translate
to
succulent
dryness
late
and
while
offering
many
complexities
that
are
difficult
to
describe
it
is
trappist
quality
through
and
through
definately
the
pick
of
the
litter
when
considering
the
koningshoeven
portfolio
reminds
me
of
a
green

a
treasure
unearthed
and
a
clear
purchase
decision
this
is
taken
shortly
after
my
2009
la
trappe
quadrupel
and
quick
comparisons
reveal
a
mellowed
sweetness
and
phenolic
nature
as
mentioned
and
the
introduction
of
vinous
oak
flavors
the
fruity
nature
was
also
less
succulent
and
felt
more
matured
generally
very
interesting
and
will
definitely
revisit
this
batch
and
the
other
3
batches
in
the
2010
vintage
a
light
oak
smell
and
taste
good
drinkable
with
a
very
good
aftertaste
i
am
very
surprised
by
this
one
because
in
my
opinion
this
abbey
brews
not
the
best
abbey
beers
this
one
however
is
a
hit
d
light
alcohol
taste
from
the
barrels
little
whisky
touch
very
drinkable
d
this
is
very
good
although
it
smells
and
looks
more
like
a
tripel
in
some
ways
im
curious
to
try
batch
2
or
3
as
i
get
a
sense
that
they
are
all
quite
different
its
a
bit
too
boozy
for
mass
quantities
but
id
love
to
work
through
a
bottle
over
a
few
hours
glad
i
was
able
to
lay
hands
on
probably
the
rarest
of
all
extant
trappist
ales
brewed
in
small
quantities
and
at
the
time
of

a

edit
just
gave
a

im
drinking
my
next
one
right
now
after
one
month
in

fridge
the
taste
is
already
perfect
unbelievable
what
a
balance
no
alcohol
in
there
what
so
ever
overall
a
very
nice
la
trappe
beer
better
than
the
regular
la
trappe
quad
as
mentioned
before
the
sweetness
in
the
taste
was
a
bit
too
much
making
this
beer
a
bit
simple
compared
to
the
bottled
version
the
tap
version
is
very
smooth
and
easy
to
drink
the
bottled
version
is
still
a
bit
too
sharp
and
needs
at
least
another
year
before
it
can
be
fully
appreciated
an
interesting
experiment
for
sure
can
wait
to
try
it
again
in
a
few
years
then
this
beer
should
be
magnificent
had
this
beer
while
in
the
netherlands
surprisingly
good
i
thought
i
was
ordering
the
westmalle
subtle
sweet
flavorings
of
caramel
and
some
spices
but
hard
to
describe
not
much
to
say
for
the
smell
though
honestly
though
this
one
should
be
up
there
with
the
rocheforts
d
just
great
i
like
the
quad
but
this
version
brings
something
extra
and
in
this
way
has
a
unique
character
now
bottle
it
please
this
poured
a
dark
brown
with
plenty
of
sediment
or
yeast
to
obscure
what
would
have
been
a
much
better
color
in
all
that
snow
globe
mess
were
some
hues
that
would
have
liked
to
be
seen
thin
head
of
off
white
foam
that
did
not
last
but
refreshed
on
each

is
a
touch
of

lots

and

and
chewy
in
places
the
carbonation
was
not
as
good
as
it

be
so
this
drank

the

of

mouthfeel
is
a

prickly
but
there
is
not
as
much

as
one
would
expect
overall
this
is
a
pretty
solid
quadrupel
a
quite
suitable
offering
on
national
beer
day
it
came
down
to
this
or
incubus
chose
ichor
strictly
based
on
the
style
of
the
beer
i
enjoy
quads
quite
a
bit
so
i
wanted
to
give
this
one
a
shot
the
beer
poured
out
as
a
traditional
brown
color
with
a
cream
colored
head
on
top
the
retention
wasnt
too
bad
here
but
there
wasnt
any
lacing
at
all
the
smell
of
the
beer
was
bready
and
fruity
there
were
also
some
aromas
of
caramel
in
there
too
the
taste
of
the
beer
has
a
sweet
start
to
it
that
gives
off
flavors
that
coinside
with
the
nose
of
the
beer
the
finishing
flavors
remind
me
of
bubblegum
the
mouthfeel
is
well
carbonated
and
gives
the
beer
is
a
decent
dry
finish
overall
its
not
a
terrible
quad
and
im
thankful
for
that
it
is
probably
one
of
the
better
slyfox
beers
on
the
market
this
was
an
average
quad
the
syrupy
texture
was
too
unpleasant
to
make
this
enjoyable
o
a
good
after
dinner
beer
that
is
like
sugar
glazed
cherries
prunes
and
raisins
it
borders
on
being
cloying
which
i
not
my
favorite
but
its
a
solid
beer
with
nice
belgian
character
overall
a
very
nice
beer
i
dig
it
and
would
by
it
again
taste
ohh
the
taste
is
pungent
tangy
a
surge
of
sugar
thick
and
creamy
mouthfeel
decadent
and
almost
too
sweet
the
faintestbriefest
alcohol
hit
towards
the
end
but
otherwise
finishes
well
i
think
i
enjoyed
the
aroma
more
than
the
flavor
d
ok
drinkability
an
interesting
take
on
a
quad
but
the
result
is
not
stellar
this
beer
has
a
raw
sweetness
that
is
seems
to
cry
for
more
shelf
time
it
seems
to
lack
the
melding
or
layering
of
flavors
of
a
complex
quad
i
will
save
my
other
bottle
for
december
because
this
beer
just
reminds
me
of
christmas
time
o
i
dont
work
quads
into
my
beer
rotation
nearly
as
frequently
as
several
other
styles
but
i
do
know
which
quads
ive
enjoyed
immensely
this
does
not
fall
into
that
category
that
said
it
is
pretty
good
and
is
worth
a
try
overall
a
good
beer
lacks
a
few
characteristics
for
the
style
definitely
worth
trying
overall
the
beer
has
some
really
nice
attributes
such
as
nice
strong
fruit
and
malt
flavors
and
aromas
but
the
weaker
body
and
the
stronger
alcohol
presence
keep
it
from
being
really
good
not
bad
but
not
really
great
either
drinkability
this
is
definitely
a
slow
sipper
but
its
reasonably
drinkable
for
the
style
i
dont
associate
slyfox
with
belgian
styles
but
this
was
good
o
nice
beer
to
slowly
sip
opens
up
more
as
you
let
it
warm
up
overall
i
was
quite
pleased
with
the
overall
flavor
and
thought
that
it
really
developed
quite
well
o
not
a
great
quad
but
you
cant
beat
the
price
poured
a
clear
dark
cola
brown
with
patches
of
white
bubbles
for
a
head
aroma
of
caramel
and
alcohol
with
a
whiff
of
dark
dried
fruits
tastes
well
like
a
quad
but
not
quite
as
complex
as
some
made
by
the
more
experienced
brewers
still
good
though
caramel
and
toffee
in
the
taste
alcohol
candi
sugar
raisins
and
figs
and
a
touch
of
banana
finishes
a
little
stale
with
dry
alcohol
medium
mouthfeel
and
pretty
drinkable
but
one
serving
is
enough
i
thought
fuller
bodied
than
expected
with
some
bready
yeast
zesty
spice
and
sweet
dark
fruit
very
sweet
with
faint
licorice
and
booze
hints
of
pepper
plum
raisin
fig
grapes
and
dark
cherry
a
bit
too
sweet
but
the
abv
is
excellently
masked
absolutely
no
heat
making
this
beer
pretty
drinkable
good
but
a
bit
one
dimensional
pours
a
very
dark
brown
some
dark
burgundy
shades
in
there
not
truly
opaque
but
comes
close
enough
bright
white
head
nose
has
some
heavy
dark
vinous
notes
a
general
dryness
about
it
too
vinous
and
candied
taste
has
some
alcohol
right
off
the
bat
dark
fruits
sweet
and
warming
with
some
brown
sugar
and
candied
notes
again
full
bodied
but
quite
sweet
almost
cloyingly
so
nice
overall
but
the
sweetness
could
be
toned
down
a
bit
d
nice
beer
high
abv
and
sweet
nature
not
so
sessionable
750
from
wegmans
williamsport
pa
this
is
a
very
enjoyable
brew
it
is
different
in
the
flavor
department
then
most
of
the
other
quads
i
have
had
very
sweet
and
smooth
very
good
but
not
as
big
and
well
flavored
as
i
would
want
could
be
too
sweet
for
some
but
you
could
session
this
brew
which
says
alot
for
a
quad
very
good
stuff
respect
not
for
nothing
but
the
cork
in
this
bottle
was
incredibly
hard
to
remove
even
with
a
wine
opener
d
my
wife
and
i
killed
the
bottle
in
20
minutes
and
still
felt
like
we
savored
every
drop
we
had
one
when
the
case
was
first
purchase
and
busted
this
one
out
of
the
cellar
to
celebrate
pizza
night
so
much
better
after
sitting
around
it
is
very
drinkable
for
such
a
massive
beer
ive
had
it
on
tap
as
well
and
that
presents
an
even
more
aromatic
and
deeper
experience
top
of
the
line
of
usa
belgian
quad
styles
up
there
with
st
bernardus
and
a
slightly
less
complex
westvleteren
summary
this
is
good
stuff
love
it
overall
the
common
theme
i
noticed
is
that
the
basic
flavors
and
aromas
are
there
but
just
not
complex
enough
to
put
this
beer
on
the
next
level
the
sweetness
in
this
beer
is
unchecked
and
too
one
dimensional
not
too
mention
the
ridiculously
thin
mouthfeel
with
some
changes
this
beer
has
potential
d
this
was
my
first
quad
and
i
must
say
it
was
pretty
tasty
you
usually
cant
go
wrong
with
sly
fox
d
i
couldnt
drink
more
than
one
bottle
of
it
but
still
a
decent
sipping
beer
not
my
cup
of
tea
due
to
heavy
sweetness
and
the
assault
of
flavors
after
the
swallow
but
still
good
big
bodied
yet
smooth
and
definitely
easy
to
sip
on
no
doubt
that
it
is
a
big
beer
but
the
alcohol
is
subdued
in
its
presence
a
great
sipper
on
a
cold
sunday
afternoon
overall
this
was
a
solid
quad
i
prefer
my
quads
to
be
more
on
the
dry
side
and
this
was
way
beyond
sweet
but
good
nonetheless
very
good
quad
nice
representation
of
the
style
sly
fox
id
like
to
know
you
better
d
good
drinkability
and
worth
checking
out
but
falls
short
when
compared
to
belgian
quads
very
big
beer
that
just
keeps
giving
back
this
beer
is
moderately
exciting
drink
it
with
a
friend
drank
it
today
and
i
must
say
i
enjoyed
every
drop
i
was
quite
impressed
by
this
brew
dead
on
style
wise
for
a
quad
i
would
have
thought
it
was
a
belgian
great
job
sly
fox
keep
it
up
i
would
by
it
again
for
sure
hv
d
pure
bliss
with
every
quaff
of
this
gem
there
may
be
bourbon
accents
or
just
that
the
high
abv
level
really
takes
off
half
way
through
as
it
warms
and
the
scents
grow
the
beer
pours
a
brown
color
with
a
thick
frothy
tan
head
that
slowly
fades
to
lacing
the
aroma
is
great
it
has
a
very
fruity
yeast
aroma
along
with
a
solid
crystal
and
roasted
malt
scent
the
alcohol
does
sneak
through
as
well
the
taste
is
good
it
has
a
very
drinkable
crystal
malt
flavor
as
well
as
a
fruity
yeast
finish
its
warming
in
the
swallow
but
its
not
too
powerful
this
is
a
tastey
beer
the
yeast
really
brings
the
flavor
together
the
mouthfeel
is
fine
it
is
a
full
bodied
beer
with
adequate
carbonation
this
is
a
silky
smooth
drinker
its
a
slow
drink
but
an
enjoyable
one
overall
its
a
decent
stab
at
the
style
certainly
has
characteristics
showing
that
it
is
trying
to
be
a
quad
it
doesnt
miss
the
mark
completely
and
has
enough
to
it
to
keep
on
with
the
sipping
but
it
seems
to
lose
some
character
as
it
warmsprogresses
sippable
despite
heat
nevertheless
this
beer
had
a
brown
pour
with
a
one
finger
tan
head
it
smelled
of
caramel
nuts
fruits
and
roasted
malts
the
taste
was
was
great
i
could
really
pull
out
all
the
flavors
that
i
mentioned
above
the
mouthfeel
was
thin
and
it
left
a
fresh
after
feel
in
my
mouth
not
bad
for
a
strong
beer
tastes
of
sweet
malts
toffee
nice
mixture
of
fruits
wine
like
and
booze
the
caveat
with
this
richly
complex
brew
is
that
the
keg
seems
to
have
gone
flat
so
the
beer
might
not
show
nearly
as
well
as
possible
i
liked
it
enough
that
i
will
certainly
give
it
another
try
if
i
come
across
it
on
tap
or
in
the
bottle
when
i
get
the
chance
the
sample
i
had
was
delivered
to
me
with
no
head
at
all
a
very
dark
beer
with
maroon
and
purple
highlights
when
held
to
the
light
good
belgian
quad
aromas
of
root
beer
cola
cherries
and
spice
waft
from
the
glass
carbonation
not
absent
when
drinking
but
certainly
subdued
and
at
least
a
bit
more
would
have
elevated
what
is
a
rich
heavy
style
the
bright
spiciness
and
winey
cherry
fruit
kept
the
beer
surprisingly
drinakble
however
a
wonderfully
complex
interplay
of
rich
flavors
i
hope
to
try
a
better
sample
someday
i
reviewed
a
bottle
of
this
earlier
and
was
quite
disappointed
but
after
enjoying
a
handpulled
pint
of
this
at
zenos
in
state
college
pa
im
thinking
i
got
a
mishandled
bottle
this
beer
has
all
the
characteristics
i
listed
before
for
the
nose
but
appearance
taste
mouthfeel
and
just
the
overall
drinking
experience
were
far
superior
to
my
last
encounter
i
love
the
rich
complexity
the
high
alcohol
is
well
hidden
by
its
fruity
and
malty
sweetness
and
as
big
as
this
beer
is
it
is
surprisingly
easydrinking
if
i
hadnt
known
better
id
have
had
a
couple
of
these
and
not
been
able
to
drive
home
safely
a
wonderful
beer
and
i
really
enjoyed
mouthfeel
is
medium
bodied
with
a
mellow
laid
back
carbonation
it
could
be
a
little
more
carbonated
but
i
cant
really
complain
an
easy
drinking
american
brewed
quad
thats
well
worth
seeking
out
a
yummy
treat
from
sly
fox
pours
a
deep
amber
to
almost
black
color
with
a
small
white
head
in
the
aroma
reminds
me
of
asiago
cheese
hints
of
caramel
and
a
touch
of
alcohol
in
the
taste
plumish
and
really
quite
like
a
latrappe
quad
a
smooth
big
bodied
mouthfeel
and
a
dry
belgiany
sugary
palum
in
the
aftertaste
great
representaion
of
style
very
la
trappe
like
sweet
and
dry
in
all
the
right
places
really
didnt
like
this
in
the
least
so
little
carbonation
i
thought
it
was
a
bad
cork
until
i
read
some
other
reviews
looked
great
in
terms
of
color
but
no
nose
to
speak
of
weyerbachers
quad
is
superior
across
the
board
to
my
mind
including
price
in
my
neck
of
the
woods
thinking
back
on
the
odyssey
perhaps
the
brewerys
philosophy
is
different
than
mine
quads
are
my
favorite
from
my
experience
this
isnt
a
good
representation
of
the
style
the
carbonation
factor
really
killed
the
score
for
me
it
does
taste
good
and
the
smell
is
definitely
the
best
quality
of
this
beer
german
pils
and
roast
malts
and
belgian
candi
sugar
german
tradition
hops
the
alcohol
was
present
very
much
like
an
american
take
on
the
quad
still
very
good
d
a
bruiser
it
packs
a
wallop
w
concealed
intensity
half
of
the
750ml
is
a
meal
in
itself
i
love
it
but
a
glass
is
filling
a
full
of
flavor
prost
drinkability
like
drinking
liquid
caramel
wheres
the
quality
control
i
had
this
side
by
side
with
a
fresh
growler
from
2007
and
a
bottled
version
from
last
year
i
rated
this
version
almost
identically
to
the
fresh
version
next
to
each
other
they
looked
the
same
nose
wise
and
flavor
wise
this
has
matured
a
bit
and
would
be
appealing
to
those
who
appreciate
a
more
dense
aroma
and
flavor
as
opposed
to
the
fresh
more
estery
version
cheers
i
must
have
gotten
a
bad
bottle
of
this
it
was
way
off
and
not
up
to
par
with
other
sly
fox
beers
i
will
review
it
with
hopes
to
try
it
again
the
body
was
deep
ruby
with
no
head
and
very
little
carbonation
i
got
a
strong
whiff
of
wet
cardboard
with
muted
alcohol
and
pepper
there
was
a
cherry
flavor
with
a
little
pepper
the
taste
was
way
off
the
wet
cardboard
smell
really
did
this
beer
in
i
couldnt
taste
much
because
of
the
smell
the
low
carbonation
gave
a
really
syrupy
body
i
am
assuming
i
got
a
bad
bottle
sensational
brew
im
not
going
to
say
this
is
on
par
with
westvleteren
or
rochefort
but
this
is
definately
one
of
the
better
american
examples
ive
tried
a
little
confused
by
it
low
score
perhaps
its
a
newer
more
improved
batch
yum
this
is
a
great
beer
the
mouthfeel
could
definately
be
a
bit
creamier
and
more
heavy
and
i
wish
the
finish
was
a
little
more
lasting
but
this
is
still
a
great
brew
worth
seeking
out
d
i
wrote
this
beer
off
after
an
earlier
tasting
but
clearly
that
was
premature
this
is
a
strong
quad
full
of
malty
strength
and
a
very
nice
product
thank
god
for
second
chances

liked

shares
some
characteristics
with

drinkability
very
tasty
beer
but
the
alcohol
tends
to
overwhelm
after
a
while
one
glass
is
enough
in
a
session
drinkability
notes

nothing
makes
this
one
hard
to
drink
its
relatively
balanced
and
the
alcohol
is
in
check
but
the
flavor
just
isnt
what
it
could
be
its
a
solid
beer
but
in
a
category
that
has
so
many
breathtaking
beers
this
one
is
lackluster
poured
a
rubyburgundy
color
with
minimal
carbonation
and
only
the
slightest
bit
of
head
aromas
of
plums
raisins
alcohol
and
maple
seemed
to
come
out
nicely
the
taste
was
sweet
with
fruity
undertones
as
might
be
expected
for
the
style
very
subtle
hops
in
the
finish
but
not
as
smooth
as
might
be
desired
with
the
flavor
profile
overly
dry
and
yet
crisp
the
beer
didnt
seem
to
flow
very
well
from
initial
sip
to
the
finish
very
disjointed
the
sweetness
was
more
like
that
of
a
doppelbock
with
fruit
flavors
taking
a
back
seat
to
the
malt
sweetness
a
good
beer
one
worth
trying
but
not
a
great
example
of
the
style
due
to
several
flaws
drinkability
smooth
rich
fruity
and
a
joy
to
sip
something
so
strong
is
so
smooth
is
amazing
oelergud
the
thick
heavy
fruity
sweetness
is
exactly
what
id
hoped
for
from
this
quad
and
even
a
bit
more
its
blended
very
craftily
and
even
slyly
if
i
may
each
piece
meshing
well
with
the
others
the
abv
is
never
shy
and
it
gives
fair
and
due
warning
wisdon
says
heed
it
if
youre
looking
for
crisp
and
refreshing
look
elsewhere
but
if
you
want
a
hearty
rewarding
quadruppel
look
no
further
youve
found
it
here
i
have
another
one
so
i

revisit
this
one

awesome

carmel
every
big
beer
lovers
dream
the
head
holds
on
the
mouthfeel
exceptional
and
the
complexity
and
balance
are
truly
remakrable
this
stuff
is
not
for
light
hearted
the
abv
is
well
over
10
as
it
warms
the
characteristics
become
more
refined
and
this
is
a
truly
remarkable
and
memorable
brew
smooth
and
delightful
in
the
mouth
as
it
warms
there
the
flavors
come
out
plums
spices
and
a
rich
malt
character
make
this
one
a
winner
this
beer
is
really
something
differentwhats
up
with
the
sticky
bottle
cappours
a
deep
chesnut
brown
with
some
ruby
hues
with
no
head
to
speak
of
the
aroma
is
of
xmas
fruit
cake
and
some
alcohol
notes
the
taste
starts
out
very
sweet
with
some
dried
fruit
thrown
in
thereits
a
sweet
beer
but
not
overdone
iam
sure
i
couldnt
drink
more
than
this
bottle
but
still
a
very
goodwell
made
beer
this
beer
poured
a
combination
of
mahogany
and
chestnut
colors
that
had
scarlet
tones
on
the
edges
when
held
to
the
light
it
produced
a
light
beige
colored
head
that
quickly
faded
into
a
simple
ring
on
the
outside
edges
and
left
behind
no
lace
the
aroma
was
intoxicating
but
not
overpowering
aromas
of
deep
dark
malts
and
sweet
malts
caramel
dark
fruits
black
cherry
plum
raisin
soft
wood
tones
a
slight
roasted
grain
and
the
warmth
of
alcohol
all
filled
my
nose
and
mouth
the
flavors
were
just
as
intoxicating
seductive
and
more
pronounced
my
tongue
tasted
rich
malts
roasted
sweet
dark
fruits
plums
raisins
black
cherries
caramel
a
warming
alcohol
candied
sugar
slight
bread
grains
and
a
hint
of
spice
the
taste
that
stayed
on
my
tongue
were
of
the
sweet
candied
sugar
and
the
warmth
of
the
alcohol
the
body
of
this
beer
can
only
described
as
thick
and
spoony
at
the
warmer
temperature
at
which
it
was
served
very
rich
and
creamy
all
through
the
taste
from
the
first
sip
to
the
last
a
very
complex
beer
that
should
be
sipped
savored
and
respected
to
the
very
end
the
bottle
label
was
correct
this
is
an
excellent
beer
fruity
whisky
malty
and
delicious
it
also
is
high
on
the
alcohol
content
and
you
can
taste
it
throughout
a
great
ale
for
a
nightcap
or
with
chocolate
it
warms
the
tongue
and
throat
sip
this
and
let
it
warm
to
enjoy
the
full
range
of
flavors
an
excellent
belgian
quad
that
doesnt
overpower
the
senses
too
much
flavorful
complex
and
very
interesting
some
of
this
beer
was
spilled
and
in
2
minutes
my
fingers
felt
as
sticky
as
a
movie
theater
floor
beautiful
dark
ruby
red
color

with
a
short
lived
small
head
this
is
a
definite
sipping
beer
for
me
unless
youre
insane
and
decide
to
gulp
it
down
the
hops
in
this
beer
were
pretty
subdued
and
taken
over
by
all
heavy
malt
sweetness
and
sugars
a
nice
treat
that
i
would
even
consider
warming
up
on
a
cold
rainy
night
rather
than
drinking
it
chilled
a
big
thank
you
to
rotsaruch
for
the
bottle
pours
a
dark
burgundy
almost
a
satin
mahogany
color
distinct
degree
of
carbonation
is
noticable
with
a
generous
foam
of
bubbles
which
forms
this
delicate
tan
head
that
quickly
fades
as
it
warms
and
i
swirl
it
gently
there
is
this
hint
of
a
sweet
fruity
bouquet
as
the
aroma
becomes
more
noticable
i
finally
need
to
accomplish
the
task
at
hand
and
give
the
poor
palate
a
chance
to
participate
in
this
splended
sensory
situation
wow
the
old
tastebuds
were
blessed
with
this
banquet
of
dark
delicious
dates
filled
with
cream
cheese
plums
and
red
rasberries
i
poured
some
more
of
this
charming
concoction
and
tasted
this
effervescence
display
of
bubbles
which
are
released
would
dance
and
dart
within
the
tasting
chamber
providing
another
unexpected
sensation
to
enjoy
there
is
this
wonderful
warming
effect
with
this
slight
but
noticable
brown
sugarlike
finish
the
finish
is
dry
and
sweet
but
not
overpowering
what
a
lovely
treat
on
such
a
miserable
cold
winter
night
ichor
means

of
the
gods

its
already
subtle

new

is
my
father
o
not
a
bad
quad
and
it
definitely
cant
stand
toe
to
toe
with
some
of
the
best
from
belgium
its
definitely
well
made
and
drinks
well
alcohol
could
be
hidden
better
but
the
flavors
meld
fairly
well
o
i
like
this
beer
i
just
wish
the
flavors
matched
the
amazing
aromas
poured
from
650
ml
bomber
into
a
liefmans
goudenband
glass
my
preferred
all
purpose
beer
tasting
glass
tasted
5413
have
to
admit
the
beer
grew
on
me
as
i
had
my
second
glass
got
used
to
the
alcohol
content
enjoyed
it
more
and
raised
a
few
of
my
scores
may
have
to
change
my
idea
that
i
would
not
buy
again
if
i
found
it
at
a
good
price
this
effort
falls
far
short
of
the
template
set
by
the
classic
belgian
quads
in
fact
there
are
many
examples
of
american
quadrupels
that
are
more
worthy
of
any
quad
drinkers
attention
mediocre
and
forgettable
too
much
alcohol
flavor
not
enough
any
other
flavor
the
coffee
didnt
make
an
appearance
and
the
cherry
was
not
in
the
forefront
the
only
thing
that
sold
me
was
did
i
mention
2
14
oz
drafts
left
over
from
tap
take
over
at
that
price
im
going
to
sample
it
all
night
long
could
be
much
tasiter
pours
a
light
reddish
brown
color
with
an
off
white
head
aroma
of
cherries
malt
and
alcohol
in
the
taste
much
like
a
big
quad
with
brown
sugar
sherry
roast
alcohol
and
fruit
there
is
a
very
slight
acidity
this
reminds
me
of
an
aged
belgian
quad
full
bodied
mouthfeel
and
wel
carbonated
overall
this
is
a
good
example
of
the
style
with
a
few
tweaks
not
a
great
beer
but
not
just
a
booze
bomb
kind
of
complex
with
the
cherries
and
spiciness
but
i
would
not
revisit
this
one
cascara
quad
pours
a
reddish
color
with
a
small
but
lacing
head
there
is
a
sweet
boozy
aroma
with
a
dark
tart
cherry
note
the
taste
has
a
nice
boozy
sharp
malty
backbone
with
good
hints
of
tart
cherries
then
the
coffee
flavors
finish
good
body
coffee
flavors
dont
mix
very
well
so
funky
aftertaste
overall
its
funky
but
enjoyable
overall
glad
this
is
out
of
my
fridge
and
i
cant
say
that
im
a
fan
maybe
it
was
a
bad
bottle
but
i
got
none
of
the
coffee
and
very
little
traditional
belgian
quadrupel
flavors
unfortunately
much
of
this
bottle
was
a
drainpour
abv
at
10
is
there
but
not
dominate
in
any
sense
o
this
is
a
fine
belgian
strong
dark
but
a
real
miss
in
the
quad
department
too
light
in
color
too
much
noticeable
alcohol
and
im
still
not
even
positive
if
the
coffee
cherries
were
a
positive

add

a

thing
that
kinda
approximates
a
quad
then
some
cherry
then
some
chocolate
and
then
a

that

it
all

with
some
coffee
flavors
that
add
a

bitterness
to
the

the
aromas
a
bit
too
yeasty
and
doesnt

very

improved
a

as

a
very

overall
i
like
that
the
coffee
and
cherries
are
supporting
characters
that
dont
taint
the
beer
i
like
the
high
abv
i
just
wish
the
alcohol
wasnt
so
obvious
regardless
its
a
nice
tasting
sipping
beer
poured

aroma

caramel

begins
with

fruit
cherry
apple
and
light

and
then
dries
out
abruptly
and
finishes
very
light
and
dry
with
a
slightly
astringent
bitterness
medium
bodied
with
spicy
carbonation
in
the
finish
an
interesting
and
odd
take
on
the
quadrupel
style
the
coffee
cherries
really
do
add
a
pleasant
cherry
flavor
i
would
have
liked
a
bit
more
presence
from
the
dates
which
would
have
given
a
bit
more
body
to
support
the
sweet
fruit
flavors
not
a
traditional
quadrupel
but
delivers
the
coffee
cherry
experience
nicely
warming
and
a
bit
alcohol
forward
mouthfeel
is
thick
without
being
all
that
sticky
overall
this
is
a
pretty
good
beer
o
i
would
drink
this
again
and
its
really
interesting
otherwise
not
obviously
great
but
worth
your
time
d
this
was
an
ok
quad
but
not
great
the
scent
and
taste
were
kind
of
bland
and
the
body
wasnt
right
for
the
style
the
alcohol
was
hidden
pretty
well
and
the
finish
was
smooth
so
it
was
at
least
easy
to
drink
missing
any
unique
character
from
the
dates
or
coffee
cherries
not
worth
aging
and
hardly
worth
trying
fresh
overall
if
this
would
have
taken
on
more
of
a
malt
backbone
and
embraced
some
other
quad
elements
this
would
be
much
better
overall
this
isnt
an
elite
beer
but
it
is
certainly
a
very
interesting
experience
keeps
the
palette
on
its
toes
and
does
not
bore
the
drinker
definitely
worth
a
try
feels
alright
still
not
zing
or
softness
of
some
quads
one
dimensional
beer
couldnt
take
this
one
poured
into
the
bushes
interesting
beer
but
too
sweet
and
undercarbonated
the
roasty
character
doesnt
mesh
well
either
o
definitely
a
quad
but
the
extra
additions
arent
extremely
noticeable
im
not
typically
a
fan
of
new
belgium
but
this
was
an
enjoyable
quad
im
assuming
its
the
coffee
cherries
that
add
the
pleasant
bitter
sweet
dimension
to
an
overall
decent
base
quad
no
problems
finishing
the
whole
bomber
in
one
sitting
overall
a
pretty
interesting
and
good
beer
good
cherry
flavor
with
a
good
presence
of
spicy
yeast
and
toasty
malt
sweet
and
rich
but
not
too
sweet
i
picked
this
bottle
up
because
i
havent
had
a
quad
for
new
belgium
brewing
company
as
soon
as
i
opened
the
bottle
i
was
over
whelmed
with
a
smell
of
cherries
the
appearance
was
a
thin
white
head
that
just
floats
on
the
top
of
the
beer
with
nice
lacing
the
smell
was
dominant
ed
by
spices
with
the
hint
of
cherries
the
taste
was
just
all
over
the
place
the
flavors
were
not
as
balanced
as
they
should
of
been
overall
not
a
bad
beer
is
just
decent
to
me
overall
a
sweet
boozy
mess
it
tastes
a
bit
like
their
dubbel
with
a
ton
of
alcohol
overall
there
is
just
way
too
much
going
on
here
it
is
a
little
bit
messy
with
nothing
seeming
to
meld
just
right
a
nice
attempt
at
a
unique
quad
but
i
feel
it
is
just
too
overdone
o
interesting
flavor
not
very
sweet
the
finish
is
very
herbaceous
there
is
some
spice
as
well
but
the
green
flavor
controls
the
finish
overall
i
thought
this
was
a
mediocre
beer
and
an
average
at
best
example
of
the
style
it
wasnt
that
true
to
style
and
it
seemed
like
the
sweetness
and
the
alcohol
took
the
place
of
all
those
great
malty
quad
flavors
it
was
really
lacking
balance
this
beer
didnt
have
good
drinkability
it
wasnt
too
smooth
it
was
boozy
and
the
flavor
couldnt
hold
my
attention
i
think
it
would
be
hard
for
me
to
drink
the
whole
bottle
im
glad
im
sharing
it
half
a
bottle
is
more
than
enough
for
me
what
i
liked
the
most
about
this
beer
was
the
appearance
i
thought
this
beer
looked
pretty
good
and
it
looked
pretty
true
to
style
what
i
liked
the
least
about
this
beer
was
the
balance
it
was
pretty
off
the
flavors
that
shouldnt
stick
out
the
most
did
and
that
made
for
a
pretty
harsh
quad
that
wasnt
very
drinkable
i
wouldnt
buy
this
beer
again
it
might
get
better
with
age
but
im
not
willing
to
risk
it
and
i
wouldnt
recommend
this
to
anyone
i
dont
think
its
a
good
example
of
the
style
all
in
all
i
was
let
down
with
this
beer
it
wasnt
what
i
was
expecting
i
had
high
hopes
after
trying
their
tripel
that
was
released
with
this
beer
but
this
turned
out
to
be
a
let
down
better
luck
next
guys
this
one
needs
some
work
so
far
this
is
my
least
favorite
beer
that
ive
tried
from
the
lips
of
faith
series
price
cant
be
beat
at
6bomber
however
i
dont
feel
all
the
components
meld
seamlessly
enough
to
drive
me
to
get
more
the
bottle
says
dates
and
cherries
taste
is
full
of
dates
and
dark
fruit
medium
sweetness
and
spiciness
somehow
the
flavors
just
dont
come
all
together
it
seems
like
all
the
ingredients
are
there
but
overall
not
a
very
balanced
brew
ok
but
not
great
mouth
feel
is
the
right
carbonation
but
the
booziness
does
something
funny
to
the
palate
going
different
format
for
this
one
cloudy
dark
caramel
not
much
head
but
pure
white
lots
of
sudsy
lace
smell
is
disappointing
not
much
going
on
there
a
little
clove
and
banana
taste
is
malty
and
pretty
middle
of
the
road
mouth
is
good
carb
fair
balance
medium
to
full
weight
overall
just
not
interesting
to
me
most
of
the
lips
of
faith
have
been
disappointing
to
me
but
i
keep
trying
pretty
difficult
to
drink
except
perhaps
in
particularly
small
quantities
i
didnt
get
a
lot
of
the
purported
dates
cherries
or
coffee
and
whats
left
is
something
of
a
pretty
messy
quad
there
are
certainly
things
to
like
in
it
and
its
an
impressive
beer
no
matter
what
i
think
of
it
personally
the
nose
on
this
beer
is
amazing
the
flavor
however
is
a
little
too
busy
for
me
complexity
is
good
thing
but
i
cant
help
but
think
they
went
a
little
overboard
with
this
beer
taste
has
maybe
a
bit
much
on
the
toast
and
is
not
as
rich
as
many
a
quad
but
not
too
shabby
actually
i
have
been
totally
unimpressed
by
all
lof
offerings
that
are
not
sour
this
one
is
fairly
impressive
though
i
like
the
cascara
and
i
agree
with
the
cherry
and
tobacco
notes
maybe
even
add
in
a
touch
of
coffee
as
well
its
not
as
sweet
as
most
quads
and
mouthfeel
not
as
thick
but
still
i
could
see
myself
picking
up
another
one
or
three
of
these
not
that
i
think
it
will
age
all
that
well
but
a
7
quad
bomber
is
a
rare
find
indeed
overall
interesting
coffee
flavor
but
the
effect
is
intense
for
a
quad
even
if
the
coffee
flavor
itself
isnt
that
strong
one
of
the
biggest
brashest
boldest
richest
beers
to
come
out
of
the
lips
of
faith
series
in
recent
memory
mmmm
right
up
my
alley
this
one
love
it
o
one
and
done
forking
over
18
for
this
is
just
crazy
on
my
part
but
that
is
what
i
do
see
new
beers
buy
them
this
is
beer
as
contemplative
beverage
you
dont
slug
this
at
the
sports
bar
among
strangers
during
the
latest
mma
event
you
drink
this
among
a
minimal
amount
of
close
colleagues
and
discuss
philosophy
between
swigs
one
to
remember
and
buy
again
if
possible
o
some
but
not
enough
malt
profile
complexity
or
dark
fruitiness
not
bad
but
not
real
good
either
almost
certainly
would
benefit
from
some
aging
jd
pours
a
hazy
dark
orange
with
a
foamy
bone
head
that
settles
to
a
film
on
top
of
the
beer
foamy
swaths
of
lace
form
around
the
glass
on
the
drink
down
smell
is
of
malt
fruit
and
brown
sugar
aromas
taste
is
much
the
same
with
fruity
flavors
on
the
finish
there
is
a
mild
amount
of
spice
bitterness
on
the
palate
with
each
sip
this
beer
has
a
good
level
of
carbonation
with
a
crisp
and
medium
bodied
mouthfeel
overall
this
is
a
pretty
good
beer
but
its
fairly
boozy
and
strong
the
alcohol
taste
fades
the
more
you
drink
but
there
is
still
an
presence
no
matter
how
much
interesting
but
definitely
a
one
time
taste
is
sweet
and
a
bit
boozy
a
quad
in
strength
but
surely
not
in
character
even
with
warming
and
exposure
this
beer
leaves
a
bit
to
be
desired
i
love
new
belgiums
stuff
but
this
one
is
a
stinker
its
not
awful
but
its
not
up
to
their
standards
which
is
a
compliment
the
fusels
kill
it
its
boozy
and
hot
and
oxidized
they
either
underpitched
the
yeast
didnt
oxygenate
the
wort
or
fermented
it
too
hot
either
way
it
definitely
doesnt
stand
up
to
other
respected
quads
typical
for
the
style
wouldnt
bu
or
recommend
this
one
even
to
my
belgian
quad
friends
overall
i
didnt
know
what
to
expect
but
this
is
a
nice
interesting
sipper
for
a
friday
night
or
any
night
overall
its
a
good
beer
not
one
of
my
favorites
though
because
im
not
too
much
of
a
cherry
fan
all
in
all
i
think
new
belgium
nailed
it
with
what
they
were
going
for
although
not
for
me
you
have
to
give
it
a
try
atmosphere
is
pretty
good
nice
hue
decent
head
and
fair
lacing
nose
is
a
great
combination
of
sour
bread
accentuated
with
fermented
fruit
pungent
and
bready
accentuated
with
bitter
fermented
fruit
overall
this
is
a
good
quaff
these
lips
of
faith
beers
are
always
a
leap
but
this
one
is
both
extremely
drinkable
as
well
as
peculiar
a
sensational
take
on
the
belgian
style
and
worth
from
the
22
oz
bottle
bought
at
royal
liquor
in
encinitas
o
for
a
quad
i
wanted
more
but
to
be
fair
this
take
on
the
style
was
adventurous
and
i
appreciate
that
i
have
had
quads
with
cherries
before
but
definitively
not
cherries
and
coffee
despite
what
i
have
wrote
above
i
feel
that
this
is
a
good
solid
beer
there
is
very
little
wrong
with
it
and
even
less
from
new
belgium
as
a
whole
this
is
decent
and
if
i
could
offer
any
advice
pour
this
and
let
it
warm
up
the
tastes
really
come
alive
took
me
a
while
to
figure
out
what
the
aftertertastefinish
reminded
me
of
it
was
something
that
ive
experienced
before
but
i
couldnt
name
it
until
i
realized
unripe
banana
yes
that
dry
mouthsmacking
sensation
from
eating
a
still
greenish
banana
i
didnt
care
for
that
t
yikes
its
like
there
are
good
flavors
in
here
but
they
all
made
the
mistake
of
attacking
your
palate
at
the
same
time
an
initial
explosion
of
belgian
yeast
tobacco
brown
sugar
molasses
dates
and
fig
but
those
all
die
as
quickly
as
they
showed
up
and
youre
left
with
a
fairly
unpleasant
sour
grain
husk
and
faded
earthy
hop
flavor
some
ash
and
cherry
skins
as
well
i
loved
the
idea
of
this
one
but
it
didnt
really
turn
out
so
well
it
almost
tastes
a
bit
flat
the
mouth
feel
is
nice
though
i
think
i
will
just
have
to
pick
up
another
bottle
and
try
it
again
oits
actually
not
a
terrible
quad
its
definitely
an
american
quad
but
it
has
a
certain
lasting
aftertaste
i
really
enjoy
also
the
abv
is
barely
noticeable
o
super
sweet
and
fruity
not
impressed
at
all
with
this
one
overall
this
isnt
bad
but
its
not
my
cup
of
tea
too
much
of
the
fruit
takes
over
the
yeast
and
breadyness
not
too
bad
o
cascara
quad
sounds
quite
incredible
on
paper
a
quad
brewed
with
date
with
coffee
cherries
added
the
nose
even
fulfills
the
description
and
expounds
on
it
nicely
really
playing
to
the
beer
styles
usual
characteristics
nicely
but
it
falls
flat
in
flavor
and
feel
abandoning
the
unique
and
compartmentalized
though
harmonious
characteristics
for
a
flavor
thats
just
the
opposite
muddled
and
underwhelming
following
the
aroma
cascara
is
by
no
means
a
bad
beer
though
and
new
belgiums
continued
innovation
is
admirable
plus
if
youre
looking
for
a
beer
with
kick
this
one
provides
it
with
subtlety
overall
a
strange
mix
of
flavors
ok
but
i
dont
need
another
one
7
110
o
decent
offering
good
variation
of
the
style
with
its
hints
of
fruit
coffee
and
tobacco
but
its
a
little
too
subtle
and
the
alcohol
burn
may
be
too
present
to
make
it
great
still
it
was
enjoyable
o
an
alright
quad
overall
but
a
bit
simplistic
and
underattenuated
i
wish
the
coffee
cherries
came
through
a
bit
more
not
offensive
by
any
means
though
the
body
was
way
too
thin
for
a
quad
it
was
pleasant
and
left
a
nice
finish
but
just
didnt
fill
the
palate
the
way
i
want
drinkability
was
good
especially
if
you
like
an
unidentifiable
funk
and
i
do
overall
this
is
one
of
those
brews
that
i
liked
but
i
didnt
think
fit
the
style
worth
trying
when
you
see
it
poured
into
glass
looks
like
a
berry
fruit
juice
with
a
thin
layer
of
white
head
that
retains
nicely
heavy
layer
of
lacing
left
behind
near
features
heavy
wave
of
belgiany
esters
up
front
with
notes
of
banana
clove
and
bubble
gum
next
comes
a
bit
of
bright
and
sweet
cherry
notes
this
is
my
first
foray
into
a
concoction
with
coffee
cherries
the
taste
is
all
belgian
quad
up
front
with
notes
of
candi
sugar
banana
and
grapes
the
coffee
cherry
comes
through
next
and
provides
a
sweet
fruity
characteristic
that
has
almost
a
chocolatey
finish
mouthfeel
is
light
with
mellow
carbonation
overall
a
very
sweet
quad
without
a
whole
lot
of
depth
and
complexity
im
not
sure
that
the
cascara
style
really
adds
anything
new
to
this
style
aside
from
some
added
sweetness
o
overall
i
was
not
a
huge
fan
of
the
beer
it
was
very
boozy
and
wasnt
as
smooth
as
id
like
i
did
like
that
there
was
a
uniqueness
to
the
beer
i
felt
that
the
beer
might
be
interesting
to
age
but
that
its
current
state
is
subpar
and
aging
should
not
be
used
as
a
crutch
belgian
beer
fans
probably
wouldnt
enjoy
this
as
much
as
drinkers
who
want
to
taste
it
for
its
unique
ingredients
date
sugar
and
coffee
cherries
i
would
recommend
it
to
those
who
want
to
try
something
different
and
dont
mind
the
taste
of
highalcohol
for
everyone
else
i
would
recommend
staying
away

not
a
good
quad
but
interesting
would
love
to
put
a
few
back
to
age
for
a
few
years
this
will
pay
dividends
i
bet
give
this
at
least
a
year
still
too
raw
off
kilter
plus
disjointed
in
otherwords
pass
for
right
now
caution
this
is
a
hot
brew
im
talking
hot
alcoholic
flavour
so
if
you
dont
want
to
taste
that
dont
put
it
into
your
mouth
if
youre
into
that
go
pick
this
up
right
now
toasted
caramel
color
with
a
fleeting
etched
surface
with
light
tan
foam
smells
like
cherry
cough
syrup
with
some
bits
of
cocoa
and
coffee
a
little
marshmallow
and
yeast
as
well
very
sweet
cherry
some
nougat
some
medicinal
syrup
not
really
feeling
this
medium
on
thin
for
the
style
with
tight
clean
carb
and
a
semi
dry
finish
one
and
done
here
im
torn
on
this
like
a
bad
train
wreck
i
have
to
keep
looking
at
im
really
impressed
with
the
lacing
yet
i
have
not
mentioned
anything
about
coffeewheres
the
coffee
would
i
buy
this
againno
but
dammit
i
just
might
o
just
not
impressed
you
put
dates
and
cherries
and
coffee
on
the
label
thats
what
im
going
to
expect
to
smell
and
taste
call
me
crazy
o
this
is
a
very
interesting
beer
very
unique

im
not
sure
how
sad
it
is
but
beer
teaches
me
more
about
the
world
than
just
about
any
other
source
anyway
this
stuff
pours
a
clear
sunset
rubyamber
topped
by
over
a
finger
of
khaki
foam
the
nose
comprises
medicinal
cherry
dust
which
also
kinda
borders
on
plum
at
times
belgian
candi
sugar
light
clove
banana
perfumey
flowers
and
a
smattering
of
honey
the
taste
brings
in
more
of
the
same
along
with
a
touch
of
coffee
in
the
background
and
some
lightlytoasted
biscuit
throughout
the
body
is
a
straight
medium
with
a
light
moderate
carbonation
and
a
sortakinda
grainy
feel
overall
i
dont
feel
the
cascara
really
works
all
that
well
here
as
it
seemed
to
go
sideways
had
that
strange
character
not
been
there
ths
probably
couldve
been
pretty
nice
but
cest
la
vie
i
spose
pours
a
hazy
reddishbrown
color
with
a
small
white
head
that
disappears
quickly
scent
is
packed
with
dark
fruit
aromas
dates
plums
raisins
figs
light
hints
of
cherry
as
well
not
really
getting
much
of
the
coffee
in
the
nose
to
me
this
one
just
smells
like
a
belgianstyle
quad
should
smell
very
inviting
aroma
on
this
one
taste
is
packed
with
the
dark
fruits
as
well
there
is
a
nice
alcohol
warmth
to
it
as
it
is
a
bit
boozy
right
now
very
tasty
date
and
fig
flavors
come
through
along
with
red
grapes
and
black
cherries
the
coffee
in
this
beer
is
very
subtle
more
booze
in
the
finish
mouthfeel
is
full
bodied
and
nicely
carbonated
drinkability
is
fairly
high
overall
i
think
a
bit
of
age
may
do
this
beer
well
it
is
a
solid
quad
but
doesnt
stand
out
too
particularly
from
other
quads
this
one
is
quite
boozy
as
well
22oz
bottle
served
in
a
goblet
pours
a
hazy
amber
with
a
thin
off
white
head
dark
fruit
in
the
aroma
also
a
bit
of
cinnamon
medium
bodied
a
lot
of
malt
sweetness
some
more
dark
fruit
a
bit
of
cherry
that
comes
out
as
it
warms
alcohol
isnt
readily
apparent
decent
but
nothing
spectacular
can
you
say
cascara
yes
please
i
think
a
little
more
gravity
wouldve
done
this
beer
a
world
of
good
but
it
still
has
plenty
going
on
to
be
worth
the
buy
o
4
overall
seems
better
than
the
sum
of
its
parts
nice
carbonation
great
look
but
a
little
lacking
in
taste
didnt
cure
my
thirst
but
my
head
got
fuzzy
after
killing
the
botle
it
did
get
more
complex
once
it
warmed
a
bit
but
id
probably
grab
the
heavenly
feijoa
radically
different
style
i
know
instead
next
time
if
i
had
to
choose
between
the
two
but
i
prefer
the
brettyfunkiness
tartness
in
most
of
my
faves
anyway
i
always
rush
to
pick
up
new
lips
of
faith
stuff
its
been
a
really
impressive
series
of
beers
always
pushing
the
limits
this
one
was
strange
pours
way
lighter
than
i
thought
medium
amber
brown
with
a
pinkish
hue
and
a
tall
fizzy
soda
looking
white
head
the
nose
is
like
gummy
bears
or
something
sweet
and
fruity
not
artificial
with
lots
of
cherry
yeast
and
booze
not
a
coffee
beer
per
se
as
a
different
part
of
the
plan
is
apparently
used
here
but
there
are
some
mild
coffee
notes
nevertheless
the
flavor
is
dominated
entirely
by
the
date
sugar
used
which
from
my
understanding
is
just
crushed
up
dates
it
really
does
have
that
sort
of
middle
eastern
feel
to
it
sweet
in
that
way
but
with
the
fruit
its
almost
too
much
its
also
aggressively
boozy
in
both
nose
and
taste
certainly
all
of
10
abv
its
punishing
impossible
to
drink
the
whole
bomber
so
good
thing
i
had
some
mates
on
deck
here
we
all
agreed
it
would
have
been
much
better
coming
in
closer
to
7
abv
anyway
the
finish
is
long
and
sweet
not
sure
id
call
it
a
quad
in
the
traditional
sense
but
its
a
tasty
and
creative
beer
thats
absolutely
worth
a
try
the
feel
is
really
light
for
the
style
not
too
much
body
at
all
the
carbonation
is
like
a
pepsi
big
active
bubbles
persistent
its
an
odd
mix
but
thats
what
we
expect
in
this
series
i
was
challenged
by
this
and
i
like
it
for
that
reason
but
i
wouldnt
buy
it
again
overall
a
pretty
solid
quad
it
started
off
a
little
harsh
but
as
it
warms
it
begins
to
open
up
and
soften
into
a
nice
cold
night
sipper
absolutely
top
dark
dried
fruits
all
around
served
straight
out
the
fridge
and
the
carbonation
took
away
from
the
taste
opened
up
as
it
warmed
lots
of
raisin
fig
prune
in
this
one
i
never
understood
the
reinheitsgebot
until
i
drank
this
beer
now
it
makes
perfect
sense
this
isnt
beer
dont
waste
your
money
o
very
impressed
very
complex
changes
as
it
warms
very
drinkable
i
avoided
imports
especially
belgian
beers
because
i
think
there
are
great
beers
made
in
america
but
there
is
something
special
about
belgian
beers
and
in
my
humility
i
must
admit
that
this
is
a
world
class
beer
a
must
try
if
you
want
to
taste
something
outside
your
comfort
zone
feel
i
may
have
had
a
bad
one
need
to
try
again
flavor
was
off
not
quad
like
old
maybe
there
is
so
much
flavor
in
this
beer
it
is
ridiculous
this
is
easily
one
of
the
best
tasting
beers
i
have
ever
had
this
is
my
favorite
quad
so
far
take
it
with
a
grain
of
salt
but
its
too
sweet
boozy
with
a
touch
of
licorice
not
a
fan
of
many
quads
and
i
relaize
this
is
at
the
top
of
its
class
so
me
not
liking
the
style
isnt
a
knock
on
an
outstanding
beer
color
is
dark
brown
with
a
beige
head
the
aromas
of
caramel
and
malt
are
dominant
dark
chocolate
plums
and
raisins
can
be
distinguished
in
the
taste
combined
with
a
tender
vinous
touch
although
the
beer
has
an
abv
of
113
it
is
very
smooth
to
drink
top
class
beer
best
beer
i
ever
drank
good
good
god
god
good
an
absolute
wild
rush
of
flavor
my
favorite
beer
on
earth
for
over
15
years
and
counting
will
leave
a
proper
review
some
time
but
for
now
just
understand
this
may
be
the
most
complex
and
delicious
beer
you
may
ever
get
a
chance
to
drink
and
the
only
beer
i
have
ever
had
that
earns
a
perfect
55
ba
score
great
beer
a
little
sharp
on
the
finish
good
flavors
and
palate
abv
is
11
30
and
is
extremely
well
hidden
overall
very
well
made
beer
extremely
accessible
and
one
i
would
go
to
over
and
over
for
the
style
one
of
the
best
made
quads
on
the
planet
and
worthy
of
the
high
ratings
very
complex
but
has
enough
clean
finish
to
make
it
worthy
of
looking
out
for
definitely
check
this
on
out
it
does
not
drink
the
abv
that
it
is
labeled
as
the
belgians
really
do
know
what
they
are
doing
amazing
best
beer
experience
ive
ever
had
clove
and
dark
fruit
permeate
both
the
aroma
and
the
palette
but
the
brew
is
frothy
yet
goes
down
very
smooth
easy
has
a
very
warm
embracing
spice
profile
to
complement
the
fig
and
plum
bread
flavor
amazing
beer
love
the
taste
and
the
complexity
minus
a
little
over
carbonated
everything
about
this
is
top
quality
and
what
i
imagine
a
quad
to
taste
like
it
does
go
down
heavy
though
one
of
the
best
worth
the
8
a
bottle
for
11
2oz
this
would
defently
be
part
of
my
last
meals
if
i
was
on
death
row
the
after
taste
that
sticks
around
your
mouth
and
you
can
inhale
into
youre
lungs
is
amazing
love
this
beer
222
bottle
incredible
beer
very
nice
dark
brown
pour
nice
head
very
thick
texture
nice
fruit
and
caramel
smell
excellent
tasting
beer
very
nice
strong
kick
going
down
quadrupels
are
among
my
favorite
beers
and
this
one
was
one
of
the
best
i
have
ever
had
highly
recommended
phenomenal
an
astounding
big
carbonated
full
bodied
pungent
delicious
quad
five
five
five
deal
with
it
lol
amazing
brew
prefer
the
abt12
slightly
more
but
its
pretty
close
glass
goblet
pours
hazy
brown
with
a
finger
of
dense
creamy
head
yeasty
esters
bread
and
lightly
caramelized
sugar
take
the
nose
tastes
of
bread
almost
no
alcohol
truly
remarkable
at
over
11
and
a
slight
sweetness
make
this
the
finest
example
of
the
style
this
is
the
best
brew
in
whats
also
my
favourite
style
and
thus
is
the
best
beer
ive
ever
experienced
from
bottle
to
disposable
hotel
coffee
cup
beautiful
ruby
color
virtually
no
head
smells
of
raisins
and
malt
light
carbonation
delicious
o
one
to
sip
slowly
it
certainly
wants
to
warm
up
a
little
coming
out
of
the
fridge
quite
strong
but
presents
itself
beautifully
as
every
sip
evolves
in
the
mouth
and
leaves
you
wanting
more
not
cheap
but
worth
every
penny
every
sip
seems
to
bring
new
flavors
this
beer
keeps
you
coming
back
for
more
while
drinking
it
so
i
could
definitely
see
drinking
several
more
of
these
in
the
future
perfect
balance
and
great
looks
needs
a
slow
pour
to
leave
the
sediment
behind
and
not
in
your
glass
wonderful
beer
will
not
disappoint
great
beer
take
your
time
with
it
and
enjoy
it
pours
a
deep
brown
murky
like
a
swamp
with
a
short
lasting
tan
head
the
aroma
is
big
dark
fruits
toffee
and
alcohol
esters
the
flavor
just
takes
that
to
another
level
the
body
is
surprisingly
light
with
a
nice
mouthfeel
and
spa
smooth
finish
everything
you
want
from
a
quad
similar
in
profile
to
the
rochefort
8
dark
muddy
brown
in
color
flavor
is
similar
but
definitely
can
taste
the
etoh
in
this
one
slightly
more
bitterdry
flavor
than
the
8
with
more
complexity
same
dry
fruits
but
with
less
esters
a
great
dark
belgian
ale
good
stuff
best
beer
ive
had
so
far
poured
into
a
belgian
goblet
about
3in
of
head
from
pour
2in
staying
after
first
sip
smells
caramelly
sweet
tastes
a
strong
burning
alcohol
with
a
sweetness
of
dates
upfront
and
a
caramelly
finish
sooo
strong
and
complex
yet
soooo
smooth
and
tasty
just
absolutely
everything
you
could
want
it
was
ok
dont
see
what
is
so
special
though
the
best
quad
ive
had
deceptively
powerful
with
complex
dark
fruit
spicy
flavors
after
buying
one
i
bought
my
local
package
shops
entire
stock
left
to
cellar
and
enjoy
throughout
the
year
overall
really
outstanding
example
of
a
good
belgian
ale
one
of
my
personal
favourite
styles
with
amazing
aroma
and
flavours
that
encourage
far
too
rapid
consumption
pair
this
with
an
equally
intricate
dessert
im
imagining
a
cheesecake
with
a
chocolate
cookie
crust
topped
with
berries
lots
of
floaties
going
on
but
a
great
beer
my
gf
and
her
friend
also
took
to
it
and
want
to
drink
it
lol
but
at
8
a
bottle
ill
keep
this
one
to
myself
cheers
o
awesome
quad
that
is
a
must
to
try
with
out
a
doubt
one
of
my
favourites
not
a
huge
trappist
fan
but
this
is
a
very
good
quad
i
had
no
idea
what
to
expect
when
popping
this
bottle
aside
from
a
recommendation
from
a
reliable
friend
of
mine
to
try
trappist
beers
pouring
it
out
the
khaki
head
was
thick
but
eventually
went
down
quite
a
bit
though
never
completely
dissipating
looking
in
the
glass
it
was
fast
apparent
that
this
is
the
opposite
of
a
wellfiltered
beer
with
little
bits
dancing
about
in
the
carbonation
color
is
very
pretty
depending
on
the
angle
of
the
light
hitting
it
it
can
display
mahogany
or
rosewood
tones
the
flavor
has
a
sweetness
to
it
that
stays
in
my
mouth
the
kind
of
complex
sweetness
that
a
dried
fruit
like
a
date
or
a
raisin
has
no
hops
to
speak
of
but
maybe
a
little
bit
of
alcohol
on
the
back
end
the
flavor
is
rich
and
complex
without
being
overpowering
and
that
is
part
of
what
makes
this
beer
such
a
pleasure
that
combined
with
the
beautiful
appearance
and
the
aroma
with
notes
of
dried
date
and
rich
caramel
show
the
obvious
master
craftsmanship
that
went
into
the
making
of
this
brew
i
guess
this
beer
is
not
my
style
warning
maybe
you
could
end
ko
in
the
floor
after
this
shot
wood
dried
dark
fruit
alcohol
brown
sugar
cherry
almond
herbs
while
i
am
partial
to
and
most
passionate
about
american
craft
beer
i
cant
imagine
a
domestic
attempt
packing
as
much
complexity
and
drinkability
into
such
a
beer
as
this
playful
carbonation
a
must
try
and
well
worth
the
price
all
other
quads
pale
in
comparison
this
is
the
standard
excellent
smooth
taste
good
for
relaxing
times
dark
honey
color
with
sediment
all
up
in
the
glass
boozey
caramel
nose
and
a
boozey
caramel
flavor
sweet
tasty
bubbly
creamy
mouthfeel
those
belgians
kill
it
amazing
brew
and
widely
available
no
reason
not
to
seek
this
one
out
v
low
value
almost
13
dollars
for
a
single
11
3oz
bottle
worth
the
money
enjoy
a
few
great
head
right
out
of
the
bottle
was
from
the
fridge
so
i
hope
i
dont
break
the
rules
on
a
belgian
ale
creamy
and
sweet
light
carbonation
greenish
on
the
backside
with
a
warming
flavor
from
the
high
av
brown
bananas
carmel
tasting
a
different
hoppy
flavor
like
the
christmas
release
from
an
english
ale
they
use
fuggle
and
golding
hops
i
think
but
a
similar
flavor
o
you
wanna
be
a
beer
snob
or
not
lacking
the
belgique
funk
of
orval
less
in
your
nose
and
face
than
trois
pistoles
beautiful
share
with
a
nonbeerliever
and
hype
it
for
the
magnificent
ale
she
be
one
of
the
best
beers
ive
had
just
a
fantastic
beer
old
stock
ale
from
north
coast
was
my
favorite
but
this
is
now
number
one
very
balanced
cola
dark
fruits
long
aftertaste
i
like
everything
about
it
but
might
wish
for
more

this
beer
did
live
up
to
expectations
i
am
not
a
fan
of
beers
that
are
best
when

this
is
an
outstanding
quad
if
you
havent
tried
do
yourself
a
favor
large
body
it
feels
like
a
big
beer
some
alcohol
taste
toward
the
finish
but
not
overpowering
overall
this
is
absolutely
in
my
top
10
rating
3
75
pours
dark
opaque
brown
with
thick
tan
head
nose
is
mostly
dominated
by
fruit
smells
of
cherry
plum
and
some
yeast
really
has
my
mouth
watering
taste
is
intense
not
getting
any
of
the
stone
fruits
until
right
towards
the
end
starts
with
a
hint
of
malt
sweetness
proceeds
very
very
quickly
to
a
facepunch
of
alcohol
the
11
3
abv
is
no
secret
here
mouthfeel
is
as
full
as
you
would
expect
from
a
quad
overall
the
alcohol
was
maybe
a
bit
too
assertive
for
me
but
it
mellowed
as
the
beer
got
closer
to
room
temp
not
an
every
day
drinker
for
me
but
next
to
a
nice
meal
this
would
be
quite
nice
i
love
this
style
of
beer
o
4
25
a
great
quad
one
of
the
best
examples
of
the
style
the
flavors
and
especially
the
aroma
are
a
bit
too
mild
for
me
so
i
think
i
prefer
st
bernardus
abt
12
o
holy
crap
i
should
have
tried
this
a
long
time
ago
wonderful
if
expensive
worth
the
expense
imo
for
an
occasional
treat
try
it
o
an
extremely
complex
beer
that
being
said
i
prefer
the
8
because
i
find
it
has
everything
i
love
in
this
beer
but
minus
the
killer
abv
and
it
has
a
bit
more
of
a
nutty
flavor
great
beer
though
and
a
true
classic
would
be
even
better
no
doubt
with
some
age
overall
an
epic
brew
easily
one
of
the
tastiest
beers
ive
had
so
far
so
full
bodied
and
rich
so
complex
at
a
seemingly
nonexistent
11
3
abv
this
bad
boy
is
straight
up
dangerous
if
it
wasnt
5
for
that
12
oz
bottle
id
buy
a
whole
lot
more
regularly
whats
up
with
the
chunky
mud
look
though
makes
me
wonder
if
i
had
an
old
bottle
or
something
ill
just
have
to
buy
more
and
see
if
it
was
an
old
bottle
i
can
say
this
brew
ages
beautifully
i
think
the
only
reason
i
dont
look
for
it
every
day
is
simply
because
of
how
easy
it
is
to
come
across
i
dont
know
if
i
have
ever
been
wowed
like
this
before
boy
do
i
like
this
beer
with
its
113
percentage
of
alcohol
it
is
so
f
king
heavy
but
still
it
is
very
drinkable
very
drinkable
cheers
overall
a
prime
example
of
the
style
very
drinkable
expensive
but
worth
every
penny
what
all
quads
aspire
to
be
great
quad
i
think
i
had
this
one
a
little
too
warm
but
will
try
again
the
taste
is
subtle
and
smooth
taste
like
heaven
in
a
glass
with
a
rich
texture
and
a
lovely
mouthfeel
the
taste
lingers
for
a
while
allowing
you
to
mellow
in
it
as
you
slowing
consume
the
goblet
never
wanting
this
to
end
poured
into
a
goblet
glass
with
much
more
head
than
expected
probably
3
finger
head
but
it
dissipated
down
to
a
light
bubble
covering
rather
quickly
aromas
of
dark
fruits
plum
and
slight
chocolate
taste
also
includes
the
dark
fruits
and
complex
malt
character
along
with
a
decent
amount
of
alcohol
mouthfeel
was
surprisingly
thick
with
ample
carbonation
very
pleasant
but
not
outstanding
especially
for
the
price
o
great
quad
as
you
would
have
guessed
from
the
rating
hopefully
more
breweries
start
making
quads
if
so
rochefort
10
is
the
beer
that
they
should
be
trying
to
live
up
to
prost
pours
a
dark
purple
brown
with
a
nice
head
smells
great
lots
of
brown
sediment
at
the
end
and
tons
of
white
particles
and
bits
throughout
the
beer
the
first
thing
i
notice
is
the
10
abv
wow
this
thing
has
a
kick
has
great
mouthfeel
and
the
beer
really
coats
your
entire
mouth
goes
down
smooth
with
a
very
strong
alcohol
burn
lots
of
substance
a
great
magnificent
beer
o
excellent
beer
the
only
fault
that
i
can
find
with
it
is
that
it
is
too
sweet
for
me
and
its
expensive
but
it
made
a
great
dessert
for
me
last
night
i
think
this
site
has
it
right
dont
miss
this
beer
if
you
have
an
opportunity
to
pick
one
up
o
crazy
good
best
quad
ive
had
and
one
of
the
best
beers
ive
had
period
try
this
if
you
havent
if
it
wasnt
for
the
strong
alcohol
taste
i
could
drink
more
than
one
o
simply
amazing
easily
one
of
the
best
beers
i
have
ever
had
spent
well
over
a
half
out
savoring
every
sip
if
you
can
get
this
do
every
beer
lover
must
experience
it
make
sure
you
give
it
ample
time
to
warm
up
do
not
drink
it
cold

50s

a

carbonation
nose
of
plums
raisins
figs
and

taste
is
sweet
and
soft
with
the
mentioned
sweet
fruits
and
caramel
but
comes
with
some
licorice
mocha
and
alcohol
a
little
too
sweet
for
my
liking
overall
i
love
this
beer
as
i
cannot
find
an
equal
in
style
from
america
this
is
unique
and
fulfilling
in
every
way
ooverall
it
is
just
this
simple
get
this
beer
overall4
0
in
spite
of
all
its
less
than
perfect
notes
this
is
a
truly
outstanding
beer
and
better
taken
as
a
whole
than
as
the
sum
of
its
parts
refreshing
somewhat
dry
and
without
a
hint
of
the
11
abv
it
packs
this
an
excellent
belgian
beer
and
while
not
the
best
example
of
the
style
it
is
still
worth
a
try
if
you
have
never
sampled
it
before
o
fun
drink
would
recommend
this
to
anyone
as
a
nice
sipping
beer
dark
brown
pour
with
a
solid
beige
head
and
lots
of
floating
yeast
sediment
aroma
is
light
but
pleasant
hinting
at
the
flavors
to
come
taste
is
full
of
dark
fruits
notes
of
raisin
plum
prune
currants
and
a
hint
of
chocolate
texture
is
rich
moderately
heavy
and
very
smooth
overall
this
didnt
blow
me
away
quite
to
the
degree
i
expected
but
still
a
fantastic
beer
beautiful
and
complex
balance
of
flavors
and
so
rich
and
smooth
bottle
33cl
2
the
years
drunk
in
its
glass
chalice
the
beer
is
brown
with
small
white
head
a
lot
of
deposit
in
bottom
of
bottle
it
is
aqueous
it
inhales
the
yeast
in
mouth
it
is
real
one
pleasure
to
savour
it
well
balanced
with
a
taste
of
candy
sugar
and
of
madeira
a
bit
of
cherry
this
exceptional
beer
is
on
another
planet
drinking
this
beer
has
shown
me
to
should
open
my
minders
posited
style
beers
more
o
theres
a
reason
this
is
considered
one
of
the
best
beers
in
the
world
and
make
no
mistake
it
is
in
my
experience
this
is
one
of
the
most
brilliantly
crafted
beers
ive
ever
had
4
75
o
this
beer
does
pretty
much
everything
right
you
can
tell
this
recipe
has
been
carefully
crafted
by
the
monks
over
the
centuries
it
does
not
disappoint
the
beer
hides
the
high
alcohol
incredibly
well
a
bottle
of
this
would
be
divine
with
a
slice
of
belgian
chocolate
cake
dark
brown
in
color
opaque
decent
rich
head
when
poured
though
dies
down
relatively
fast
sweet
malty
smell
though
faint
delicious
full
malty
sweet
taste
sweet
finish
easy
to
drink
medium
to
heavy
body
nice
light
carbonation
wanted
another
when
i
finished
great
belgium
beer
o
this
would
be
a
great
after
dinner
drink
but
it
could
fit
anywhere
really
delicious
and
satisfying
and
very
drinkable
for
the
abv
id
reccomend
this
to
anybody
who
loved
beer
ill
definitely
be
buying
more
a
this
is
such
a
great
trappist
brew
that
whenever
i
drink
it
i
feel
like
a
merry
monk
yes
the
abv
is
high
but
the
flavor
of
this
brew
is
full
variety
of
flavors
it
has
a
very
smooth
texture
for
me
the
sediment
is
also
interesting
it
has
a
nice
coloration
and
once
it
hits
you
towards
the
end
of
the
drink
it
adds
a
subtle
complex
flavor
that
can
only
be
expected
from
a
trappist
some
trappist
style
brews
do
not
have
as
nearly
the
great
flavor
as
this
one
does
so
this
one
for
me
is
a
favorite
among
trappist
style
brews
o
although
there
isnt
any
aspect
of
this
beer
that
i
would
say
is
the
best
for
any
beer
that
i
have
ever
had
it
is
so
well
balanced
and
continuously
brings
hints
of
new
and
intriguing
flavors
that
all
work
so
well
together
for
that
reason
this
is
one
of
the
best
beers
i
had
had
in
recent
memory
well
carbonated
heavy
dense
beer
the
brew
has
a
murky
rust
color
with
chunks
and
specs
of
yeast
suspended
around
nice
frothy
khaki
head
no
lacing
aroma
is
plums
cherry
skins
booze
tastes
of
plums
light
cocoa
a
nice
light
bitter
balance
apricot
vanilla
bean
medium
bodied
a
wee
bit
over
carbonated
but
not
undrinkable
very
solid
quad
o
great
beer
i
havent
had
this
before
it
is
delicious
i
will
definitely
try
again
o
i
love
this
beer
i
wish
i
had
tried
it
sooner
this
is
a
perfect
end
of
the
day
after
a
meal
drink
wow
this
bottle
has
everlasting
head
poured
a
solid
three
fingers
and
dissapated
to
a
12
finger
layer
that
has
refused
to
leave
pours
a
very
murky
brown
aroma
has
lots
of
brown
sugar
caramel
and
some
vanilla
mixed
with
fruit
some
sort
of
dried
candied
fruit
plum
perhaps
taste
is
quite
pleasant
lots
of
sweetness
but
not
overdone
and
is
certainly
well
balanced
follows
the
nose
very
well
delicious
gardenlike
quality
to
the
taste
makes
this
beer
unique
and
worth
trying
one
of
the
best
beers
ive
ever
had
lots
of
floral
notes
its
a
heavier
beer
makes
for
a
nice
dessert
beer
i
like
the
sediments
at
the
end
that
pour
into
the
glass
make
sure
you
spend
the
money
for
the
right
glassware
it
just
makes
the
beer
stand
out
and
allows
you
to
get
the
full
effect
one
of
the
most
drinkable
beers
out
there
and
what
size
11
2
and
goes
down
like
nothing
complex
with
spicy

notes
with
lots
of
dark
fruits
pretty
noticeably

character
esp
in
the
aftertaste
huge

really
an

overall
i
thought
this
was
very
good
beer
and
a
very
good
example
of
a
quad
it
had
pretty
much
all
the
aspects
that
i
look
for
in
the
style
but
i
still
found
it
to
be
pretty
unique
for
the
style
and
it
kind
of
has
its
own
thing
going
on
that
i
havent
seen
in
other
quads
this
beer
had
good
drinkability
it
was
smooth
clean
a
little
rich
a
little
creamy
a
little
filling
and
the
tasting
did
a
great
job
at
holding
my
attention
i
would
be
pretty
happy
sipping
on
a
couple
of
these
especially
on
a
cold
winter
night
what
i
like
the
most
about
this
beer
was
how
it
wasnt
like
a
lot
of
quads
that
ive
had
but
it
still
stayed
very
true
to
style
what
i
liked
the
least
about
this
beer
was
nothing
it
is
a
little
expensive
but
thats
to
expected
with
most
of
these
good
belgian
beers
i
would
for
sure
buy
this
beer
again
i
would
like
to
keep
a
couple
in
the
cellar
but
the
price
would
prevent
me
from
buying
a
lot
of
it
i
would
recommend
this
beer
to
just
about
anyone
i
think
every
craft
beer
drinker
should
try
this
beer
all
in
all
i
was
pretty
impressed
with
this
beer
i
have
no
clue
why
it
took
me
so
damn
long
to
try
this
beer
but
im
glad
i
finally
did
and
i
wont
be
sleeping
on
the
one
anymore
so
far
this
just
might
be
my
favorite
quad
and
its
for
sure
one
of
the
best
ones
ive
have
had
the
only
one
from
them
i
have
left
to
try
is
the
8
so
i
will
have
to
pick
one
of
those
up
soon
great
job
guys
i
really
enjoyed
this
beer
keep
up
the
great
work
wonderful
very
complex
estery
character
with
enough
alcohol
to
warm
the
belly
but
not
detract
from
the
experience
truly
a
beauty
of
a
beer
o
a
great
example
of
the
style
and
a
quality
brew
overall
ranking
likely
impacted
by
this
not
being
my
favorite
style
of
beer
o
one
of
the
best
beers
ive
ever
had
certainly
worth
a
try
to
the
novice
trappist
drinker
the
beer
pours
a
light
tan
head
that
dissipates
fairly
slowly
the
beer
itself
is
an
obscure
dark
purplish
brown
with
bits
of
yeast
gobules
in
it
the
beer
has
a
fairly
complex
smell
to
it
a
hoppy
smell
dominates
the
nose
but
with
notes
of
dark
fruits
the
dark
fruits
appear
to
be
prunes
but
are
very
faint
in
addition
to
hops
and
dark
fruits
the
smell
has
a
fairly
peppery
and
salty
smell
as
well
as
hints
of
sugar
to
it
the
taste
resembles
the
smell
fairly
strongly
the
taste
has
a
stronger
pepper
taste
with
hints
of
hops
but
with
faint
traces
of
dark
fruits
the
taste
is
fairly
complex
with
subtle
notes
that
can
easily
escape
a
persons
palate
if
theyre
not
too
careful
the
mouthfeel
is
fairly
surprising
the
beer
itself
is
heavy
bodied
with
a
surprising
amount
of
carbonation
but
feels
light
compared
to
other
quads
overall
a
very
good
beer
and
worth
getting
and
enjoying
this
is
about
perfect
not
even
a
hint
of
soapiness
that
other
high
scoring
belgians
can
deliver
the
11
3
abv
is
hardly
noticeable
very
subtly
complex
for
fans
of
gulden
draak
quad
9000
or
st
bernardus
abt
12
this
may
oust
both
of
those
for
me
this
was
my
favorite
belgium
beer
until
i
tried
i
tried
westy
12
this
has
a
great
aroma
and
taste
it
has
a
powerful
kick
to
it
but
a
nice
and
smooth
aftertaste
i
like
this
beer
cold
but
not
ice
cold
the
10
is
by
far
the
best
of
the
rochefort
beers
o
a
classic
definitely
one
everyone
should
experience
o
very
pleasent
this
beer
was
a
treat
indeed
i
will
buy
again
and
am
happy
to
have
finally
ventured
into
this
style
cheers
and
god
bless
i
loved
and
definitely
respected
this
beer
but
was
not
blown
away
if
i
didnt
have
westy
first
maybe
i
would
feel
different
but
the
carbonation
level
is
what
holds
back
the
higher
rating
cheers
great
beer
a
classic
o
flavors
are
very
balanced
and
aside
from
the
smell
not
being
very
strong
just
an
amazing
beer
overall
this
beer
is
amazingly
smooth
and
almost
too
hard
to
describe
its
just
so
balanced
smooth
fruity
roasted
perfection
the
high
alcohol
is
only
noticeable
as
a
slight
warming
and
does
not
show
through
in
the
flavor
excellent
beer
7
59
for
330ml
the
best
o
nutty
roasty
dark
fruity
perfect
for
as
high
as
the
abv
is
the
alcohol
is
barely
noticeable
this
beer
has
complex
aroma
of
malty
fruity
smell
my
initial
impression
was
that
i
was
drinking
a
grape
soda
the
fruitiness
of
this
beer
is
in
the
front
but
its
gets
more
complex
set
of
flavors
after
the
head
sets
in
which
it
went
fast
i
think
its
a
tad
sweet
for
my
liking
i
would
recommend
you
let
it
sit
for
a
few
minutes
before
drinking
cheers
o
i
ordered
this
at
an
early
family
dinner
not
realizing
the
alcohol
content
until
a
few
sips
in
i
started
to
feel
the
magic
of
this
wonderful
brew
after
only
a
few
sips
besides
a
slight
warming
effect
you
really
dont
taste
the
alcohol
my
only
complaint
is
the
aroma
could
be
a
little
stronger
other
than
that
the
taste
and
mouthfeel
are
just
what
i
expected
from
a
trappist
beer
will
definitely
have
it
again
overall
i
had
this
for
the
first
time
a
few
months
ago
out
of
a
chilled
bottle
poured
into
proper
glassware
and
it
captured
my
imagination
completely
upon
a
repeat
purchase
well
actually
1
of
6
bottles
since
rochefort
10
is
seasonal
around
these
parts
it
lived
up
to
the
expectations
i
maintained
for
every
bottle
of
this
worldglass
beer
as
constructed
in
my
head
based
on
that
first
experience
last
summer
a
true
treat
for
my
birthday
this
time
worthy
of
all
the
praise
it
gets
and
a
beer
that
you
shouldnt
miss
the
opportunity
to
try
if
you
get
the
chance
d
i
was
very
excited
to
try
this
beer
and
left
extremely
disappointed
maybe
i
need
to
try
another
bottle
sometime
i
dont
know
maybe
im
missing
something
here
but
if
i
wanted
mickeys
id
buy
mickeys
for
less
than
this
one
bottle
i
would
not
recommend
i
wanted
to
like
it
just
wasnt
possible
o
so
glad
i
started
paying
ludacris
amounts
of
money
for
beer
i
never
considered
purchasing
a
few
years
ago
its
hard
to
believe
you
can
make
such
humble
ingredients
into
an
elixir
like
this
unforgettable
overall
i
wish
i
had
more
of
this
beer
bought
two
one
to
drink
and
one
to
age
cannot
wait
to
try
this
in
about
3
years
this
is
a
winner
anyone
who
likes
belgians
needs
to
try
this
our
group
of
4
beer
advocate
members
did
a
recent
small
bottle
tasting
of
high
alcohol
brews
among
the
12
brews
tasted
was
trappistes
rochefort
10
belgium
ale
we
did
a
direct
comparison
tasting
of
the
rochefort
10
against
the
westvleteren
xii
the
rochefort
10
was
chosen
the
better
3
to
1
and
tied
for
4th
highest
average
score
of
the
12
brews
tasted
at
4
25
smoothness
being
the
deciding
factor
between
the
the
rochefort
10
and
the
westvleteren
xii
the
westvleteren
xii
came
in
9th
of
the
12
brews
tasted
with
an
average
score
of
at
3
81
o
refreshing
and
complex
there
is
so
much
going
on
here
a
must
try
for
any
beer
drinker
pours
a
dirty
brown
mahogany
color
with
some
copper
and
ruby
hues
where
the
light
strikes
it
a
thin
veil
of
offwhite
head
develops
lingers
briefly
and
then
dissipates
to
a
patchy
collection
of
bubbles
across
the
surface
of
the
glass
minimal
lacing
the
aroma
is
of
candied
brown
sugar
plum
date
raisin
some
toffee
more
ubiquitous
dark
fruits
and
caramel
a
distinct
belgian
yeast
aroma
is
also
present
alongside
subtle
clove
the
taste
begins
with
a
bit
of
the
brown
sugar
before
a
rush
of
fruit
comes
through
dark
raisin
plum
date
and
even
some
grape
a
nice
yeasty
funk
and
some
straw
finishes
it
off
mouthfeel
is
full
bodied
but
not
too
viscous
thanks
to
adequate
carbonation
it
is
lively
and
finishes
dry
with
some
of
the
fruity
flavors
lingering
on
the
palate
overall
this
is
a
phenomenal
belgian
quadruple
that
is
absolutely
worthy
of
praise
and
attention
well
balanced
full
of
flavor
and
simply
an
excellent
brew
o
im
really
gonna
have
a
hard
time
recommending
this
beer
to
customers
until
i
get
a
decent
bottle
again
kinda
sucks
at
this
price
point
what
the
hell
is
going
on
here
i
know
its
not
supposed
to
taste
like
this
fantastic
one
of
the
better
beers
youll
ever
have
a
great
nutty
finish
balanced
and
smooth
5
years
ago
i
didnt
understand
what
good
beer
was
a
bottle
of
this
changed
my
life
a
beautiful
belgian
ale
at
11
3
alc
trappistes
rochefort
10
has
got
it
it
going
on
this
is
incredible
i
had
forgotten
how
excellent
it
really
is
the
look
is
so
fresh
and
its
very
neat
to
see
a
bestusedby
date
of
january
2018
often
at
least
in
my
opinion
beers
that
cross
the
10
abv
line
lose
a
lot
of
the
beer
quality
for
sheer
alcoholic
punch
basically
an
unusual
wine
taste
this
is
one
of
the
exceptions
the
smell
and
taste
have
a
sweet
and
spicy
theme
the
first
smell
is
grape
and
then
followed
by
pepper
and
spice
i
believe
the
taste
does
the
same
but
the
pepper
is
the
dominant
note
this
brew
is
hard
to
beat
of
course
i
will
get
this
again
the
biggest
and
darkest
of
the
rochefort
clan
poured
into
a
goblet
from
the
iconic
bottle
color
is
dark
brown
with
a
decent
amount
of
tan
foam
but
less
aggressive
carbonation
than
the
6
and
8
not
to
mention
other
trappist
beers
body
is
thicker
than
other
trappists
but
still
falls
short
of
imperial
stout
or
barleywine
values
aroma
is
rather
impressive
milk
chocolate
rum
raisins
brown
spices
and
a
blast
of
alcohol
smells
like
a
chocolate
brownie
drizzled
with
rum
sauce
tastes
strong
and
boozy
but
quite
sweet
as
well
brown
rye
bread
and
cacao
powder
dried
dark
fruit
like
dates
or
figs
caramelized
bananas
burnt
dark
sugar
and
molasses
ample
clove
and
ginseng
spice
culinary
herbs
wickedly
complex
and
infused
with
aromatic
alcohols
one
of
the
more
boozy
beers
ive
had
but
this
works
with
the
other
elements
finishes
earthy
woody
and
a
little
tannic
like
overly
steeped
tea
surprisingly
complex
but
id
say
the
spicy
earthy
elements
trump
the
sweet
components
in
the
overall
impression
my
favorite
trappist
ale
and
widely
regarded
as
one
of
the
worlds
best
beers
the
fact
that
it
is
easy
to
find
to
the
point
where
some
fools
derogate
it
as
a
shelf

after

it

and
appreciated
one
at

had
them

drink
the
alcohol
was
extremely
well
hidden
and
youd
never
know
it
was
a
11
beer
the
drinkability
is
amazing
and
it
makes
the
perfect
winter
warmersipper
beer
very
tasty
but
too
rich
and
correspondingly
expensive
and
high
abv
to
keep
drinking
all
night
its
got
some
serious
warming
from
the
alcohol
i
think
ive
mentioned
that
a
couple
of
times
already
the
first
thing
that
i
taste
right
after
the
sting
is
licorice
immediately
followed
by
a
peppery
spice
then
a
sugary
truffle
well
and
hints
of
figs
and
nutmeg
hops
are
invisible
its
definitely
got
a
malty
spine
and
that
dark
fruitiness
that
you
expect
in
a
world
class
quad
for
the
complexity
taste
and
overall
experience
i
score
this
one
high
but
it
fails
on
drinkability
for
me
so
i
cant
give
it
an
a
its
a
b
imho
however
if
this
is
any
indication
of
how
the
trappist
westvleteren
12
is
going
to
be
i
cant
wait
to
get
my
hands
on
a
bottle
if
any
of
you
know
where
i
can
get
ahold
of
the
unicorn
they
call
the
westy
12
by
all
means
send
one
my
way
its
mouthfeel
is
smooth
and
silky
but
still
a
little
abrasive
i
now
understand
the
difference
between
a
secular
trappist
ale
only
with
a
trappist
can
you
say
holy
sht
im
getting
drunk
and
literally
mean
it
whether
or
not
you
are
a
believer
you
can
definitely
appreciate
this
as
the
work
of
god
pure
sex
in
my
mouth
that
is
the
only
way
i
can
really
bring
to
life
the
emotion
that
i
have
every
time
i
our
this
a
few
days
ago
i
enjoyed
it
by
myself
and
this
evening
i
shared
a
bottle
with
my
wifes
dad
russian
who
doesnt
care
what
it
is
as
long
as
it
has
alcohol
and
he
was
speachless
after
the
first
sip
d
quite
drinkable
at
11
3
abv
a
more
pronounced
herbaceousness
than
i
was
expecting
especially
compared
to
the
3
year
old
westy
12
i
tried
it
next
to
i
think
its
arguably
more
complex
than
the
westy
a
beer
i
think
its
deservedly
compared
to
and
while
id
put
it
in
my
top
5
quads
ive
had
i
think
the
westy
still
wins
out
this
is
quite
simply
a
fantastic
delicious
decadent
beer
very
complex
with
a
great
malt
backbone
the
alcohol
is
nearly
invisible
except
for
a
touch
in
the
nose
i
could
drink
it
all
night
if
i
didnt
start
feeling
tipsy
halfway
through
my
glass
very
drinkable
and
world
class
the
smell
is
of
burnt
sugar
which
i
love
and
a
little
bit
of
light
fruit
the
taste
is
of
dark
fruit
and
more
sugar
and
light
spices
like
nutmeg
it
ends
with
a
creamy
finish
while
this
may
not
seem
like
a
5
description
they
are
done
so
perfectly
and
blended
so
amazing
i
can
almost
not
even
explain
it
the
mouthfeel
is
very
good
with
more
of
a
creamy
nutty
finish
this
beer
tastes
no
where
near
11
3
i
could
of
drank
this
extremely
fast
and
could
of
drank
another
just
as
fast
afterwards
if
i
wanted
to
by
far
the
most
drinkable
beer
i
have
ever
had
and
if
i
could
give
it
a
10
for
drinkability
i
would
it
deserves
the
hype
dbest
belgian
quad
drank
this
side
by
side
with
a
3
year
westy
12
and
rochefort
came
out
on
top
legendary
in
the
same
vein
as
st
bernardus
abt
12
dark
brown
look
probably
less
head
than
st
b
12
but
is
perhaps
a
bit
more
drinkable
because
of
a
softer
carbonation
for
such
a
high
abv
beer
this
is
a
bit
different
than
st
b
12
in
that
it
smells
a
tad
bit
more
like
fruit
than
fine
sherry
st
b
the
taste
is
less
fruity
but
as
i
mentioned
more
drinkable
and
dare
i
say
i
prefer
this
beer
a
bit
more
because
of
it
you
have
to
drink
this
slow
the
alcohol
is
nearly
nonapparent
barely
even
warming
save
this
one
for
the
pope
because
beer
is
living
proof
that
god
loves
us
and
wants
us
to
be
happy
b
f
this
is
one
amazing
beer
the
care
and
craftsmanship
that
must
have
gone
into
this
recipe
over
time
boggles
my
mind
there
are
so
many
subtleties
that
complement
one
another
in
a
symbiotic
manner
all
that
said
yes
i
want
this
again
but
it
is
not
something
that
i
could
or
would
want
to
drink
regularly
i
think
my
brain
would
explode
if
i
did
lovely
beer
d
quads
are
my
favourite
style
of
beer
and
this
beer
demonstrates
why
i
love
belgian
beers
above
all
others
dthis
is
one
for
the
savoring
while
being
almost
light
on
the
palate
for
the
abv
and
the
style
o
outstanding
i
fully
understand
why
so
many
rate
this
beer
as
highly
as
they
do
definitely
an
epic
drink
in
my
top
2
quads
and
certainly
in
my
top
510
beers
across
all
styles
period
drinkability
is
hard
to
say
it
tastes
and
feels
wonderful
so
in
a
sense
it
is
incredibly
drinkable
however
it
is
a
very
strong
beer
and
is
certainly
a
sipper
you
wouldnt
want
it
to
go
quickly
anyway
still
a
quite
excellent
beer
that
will
only
get
better
with
time
i
look
forward
to
trying
cellared
bottles
a
year
and
two
years
from
now
not
too
bad
needs
to
be
less
expensive
that
would
make
this
brew
a
bit
more
drinkable
one
or
two
is
worth
the
price
though
its
also
a
tad
too
sweet
a
slow
sipper
but
more
because
i
want
to
drink
it
slowly
than
because
i
have
to
probably
my
favorite
beer
at
the
moment
very
good
beer
that
went
down
much
easier
than
expected
had
wonderful
rich
flavor
that
disappeared
quick
i
am
a
huge
fan
of
rochefort
i
personally
enjoy
the
8
and
6
much
more
however
i
feel
they
are
the
best
trappist
ale
i
have
had
to
date
a
d
what
an
awesome
beer
why
have
i
not
been
buying
this
every
time
i
see
it
at
the
store
d
very
high
you
can
hardly
tell
the
abv
is
more
than
10
the
flavor
is
phenomenal
and
the
smell
is
wonderful
really
blown
away
by
this
one
d
very
nice
and
really
should
be
enjoyed
with
breads
cheeses
or
a
hearty
meal
this
is
fruity
and
full
highly
highly
recommended
what
is
there
to
say
but
this
is
an
exceptional
beer
aroma
isnt
what
i
would
consider
complex
but
it
is
so
good
it
only
whets
your
appetite
for
whats
to
come
it
is
very
sweet
i
like
that
like
a
liquid
candy
bar
in
a
good
way
but
its
somehow
balanced
or
tempered
by
the
yeast
and
alcohol
the
alcohol
accentuates
the
taste
rather
than
just
creating
a
pleasant
warming
or
boozy
quality
it
certainly
has
similarities
to
malt
liquor
but
it
seems
every
sip
brings
something
new
my
only
complaint
is
the
bottle
isnt
big
enough
d
very
easy
to
slug
back
but
the
abv
started
hitting
me
quickly
the
booziness
becomes
pretty
evident
after
it
warms
a
bit
one
of
the
best
belgians
you
can
buy
in
the
us
in
my
opinion
d
very
nice
and
drinkable
this
one
easily
waltzed
itself
into
my
personal
list
of
favourites
and
once
again
its
only
confirmed
by
thousands
of
other
beer
enthusiasts
around
the
world
reddishbrown
with
a
bit
of
head
smells
delicious
with
fruits
figs
and
spices
noticeable
tastes
just
as
good
and
the
alcohol
is
definitely
present
the
fruits
and
spices
are
in
abundance
yum
very
enjoyable
and
drinkable
but
as
is
with
any
11
3
proceed
with
caution
very
happy
with
this
tasting
d
very
solid
drinkability
for
its
high
alcohol
definitly
a
sipper
and
not
a
session
beer
by
any
means
but
very
good
this
was
a
very
tasty
beer
there
is
so
much
flavor
it
is
difficult
to
experience
it
all
in
just
one
beer
i
will
definitely
look
for
this
again
someone
told
me
that
this
is
the
type
of
beer
you
need
to
sip
slowly
to
enjoy
but
you
will
want
to
gulp
it
down
boy
was
he
right
it
poured
a
very
very
dark
brown
with
a
light
1
finger
head
the
smell
as
a
bit
fruitier
than
i
was
expecting
when
you
sip
it
you
notice
immediately
that
it
coats
your
entire
mouth
but
it
is
not
heavy
at
all
i
know
others
have
commented
on
the
alcohol
bite
but
i
did
not
notice
it
at
all
something
quite
exceptional
for
a
beer
with
this
abv
the
taste
is
complex
but
not
overbearing
i
do
get
some
dark
fruit
notes
but
everything
is
balanced
exceptionally
well
it
has
a
short
finish
but
it
is
satisfying
i
was
surprised
at
complex
this
was
without
hitting
you
in
the
face
in
a
word
subtle
it
scores
a
perfect
100
when
it
comes
to
drinkability
i
cant
imagine
anything
this
wouldnt
compliment
and
i
couldnt
imagine
a
time
of
day
or
night
when
i
wouldnt
enjoy
one
of
these
top
notch
d
this
is
a
fine
sipper
and
truly
a
world
class
beverage
crap
this
is
good
beer
one
finger
head
of
medium
brown
hue
thick
lace
with
little
cling
color
is
a
33
on
the
srm
beer
color
chart
smells
of
melon
raisins
plum
peach
molasses
grapes
flavor
is
one
of
the
best
i
have
sampled
figs
plum
peach
pear
melon
molasses
caramel
chocolate
the
more
i
taste
the
more
flavors
i
find
rich
and
creamy
in
my
mouth
i
would
like
to
drink
this
all
day
but
with
the
price
and
the
abv
or
almost
12
percent
i
dont
think
this
will
happen
this
is
a
really
good
beer
d
this
beer
is
a
fantastic
example
of
the
style
the
abv
doesnt
really
seem
to
be
there
in
aroma
and
taste
i
would
recommend
this
beer
to
anyone
who
wants
a
good
trappist
beer
without
paying
an
arm
and
a
leg
for
another
one
that
you
cant
get
in
the
states
pours
a
black
w
a
perfect
off
white
2
finger

it
looks
perfect
in
my
chimay
glass
thus
the
rare
5
on
appearance
the
smell
is
fantastic
dates
walnuts
malt
spice
very
complex
smell
i
wish
i
didnt
have
a
cold
right
now
because
im
having
a
hard
time
picking
up
all
the
smells
still
great
though
the
taste
one
word
comes
to
mind
when
i
take
my
first
sip
wow
i
dont
know
where
to
begin
caramel
dates
raisin
malt
and
alcohol
hit
the
taste
buds
each
mouthfeel
is
like
eating
a
loaf
of
bread
but
still
smooth
slight
burn
w
the
alcohol
aftertaste
what
a
great
beer
at
11
3
its
a
sipper
and
you
wouldnt
want
more
than
one
in
a
sitting
world
class
all
the
way
this
is
definitely
one
of
my
favorite
quads
and
one
of
my
favorite
beers
period
pours
black
with
a
large
beautiful
offwhite
head
special
care
must
be
taken
to
stand
this
one
up
for
awhile
before
enjoying
and
when
its
poured
unless
you
want
to
chew
it
you
need
to
keep
a
close
eye
on
the
neck
of
the
bottle
and
pull
back
when
you
see
that
healthy
sediment
start
to
slide
down
unique
and
wonderful
smell
of
malt
and
banana
flavor
is
fantastic
a
malty
plumlike
flavor
that
is
dry
and
yeasty
soft
mouthfeel
despite
the
healthy
carbonation
goes
down
nice
with
flavor
to
the
end
finishes
dry
and
complete
an
outstanding
beer
that
i
personally
enjoy
with
some
nice
aged
gouda
dpretty
easy
drinking
for
high
of
an
abv
this
one
is
i
couldnt
see
having
more
than
a
small
bottle
of
it
due
to
the
richness
of
it
though
drinkability
was
only
ok
for
me
i
know
quad
belgians
are
not
my
favorite
but
i
was
expecting
a
bit
more
from
this
beer
it
was
ok
but
i
will
not
go
out
of
my
way
to
have
it
again
nothing
really
stood
out
to
me
as
exceptional
overall
an
incredible
beer
so
much
complexity
and
depth
this
is
truly
a
world
class
brew
recommended
overall
im
honestly
disappointed
for
a
top
10
beer
i
expected
more
especially
a
top
ranked
belgian
i
was
most
surprised
by
the
strong
alcohol
smell
and
taste
most
good
beers
of
this
abv
hide
that
now
my
only
other
quad
experience
is
ommegang
three
philosophers
so
im
not
a
quad
expert
i
might
get
another
bottle
to
age
and
see
if
that
improves
it
my
guess
from
the
date
stamped
on
the
label
is
that
this
was
bottled
41410
so
it
would
be
10
months
old
so
it
might
need
more
time
on
top
of
that
im
also
curious
about
how
other
reviews
either
highlight
the
alcohol
presence
or
talk
about
this
wonderful
complex
amazing
beer
will
update
if
i
get
another
one
one
of
the
best
beers
ive
tasted
a
classic
quadrupel
serving
type
bottle
d
very
smooth
alcohol
is
present
and
strong
but
is
dulled
by
the
sweet
fruit
presence
d
i
really
enjoy
this
beer
it
has
amazing
flavors
and
aromas
it
feels
a
bit
lacking
and
for
something
this
alcoholic
it
drinks
incredibly
easy
id
love
to
do
this
one
again
very
good
example
of
the
style
d
good
thing
this
is
a
pretty
chunk
per
bottle
or
else
the
11
3
would
sneak
up
on
me
you
can
taste
it
but
you
dont
really
care
about
it
mouthfeel
of
a
worldclass
beer
the
flavors
dont
all
present
immediately
but
dont
linger
and
inspire
you
to
hold
a
mouthful
as
long
as
you
continue
to
find
new
subtleties
within
the
taste
overall
this
is
a
damned
good
beer
right
there
with
st
bernardus
abt
12
though
i
did
enjoy
pannepot
reserva
08
a
bit
more
d
i
wouldnt
have
more
than
one
at
very
least
not
in
a
row
but
at
112
percent
you
wouldnt
need
much
more
to
satisfy
a
pensive
beer
geek
such
as
myself
omg
the
head
is
amazing
has
the
look
of
luxury
tastes
a
tad
sweeter
than
trappistes
rochefort8
but
maintains
all
the
other
great
qualities
of
that
beer
i
actually
like
this
beer
better
primary
flavors
for
me
are
banana
and
raisin
but
they
are
not
overwhelming
delicious
d
my
favourite
beer
i
have
ever
had
it
is
11
3
abv
and
it
drinks
well
but
shows
its
strength
just
like
i
would
hope
it
would
o
phenomenal
wow
best
quad
yet
sweetness
is
just
perfect
d
good
not
great
pretty
much
your
standard
trappist
ale
nothing
offensive
per
se
but
nothing
exciting
either
drinkability
it
was
like
a
fine
cognac
you
felt
the
alcohol
bite
but
it
was
not
off
putting
overall
this
beer
is
incredibly
rich
strong
and
complex
it
deserves
to
be
sipped
at
about
55
degrees
after
a
square
meal
i
cant
say
ill
be
drinking
this
often
but
when
i
do
it
will
be
memorable
this
beer
poured
the
darkest
of
browns
with
a
two
finger
light
khaki
head
the
aromas
are
of
plum
yeast
bread
and
alot
of
alcohol
it
also
has
this
slightly
off
sour
tinge
to
it
meh
its
very
bready
and
gives
off
a
lot
of
dark
fruits
of
course
a
little
too
much
alcohol
this
makes
me
crave
a
st
bernardus
12
abt
it
drinks
ok
and
thats
about
it
its
still
crisp
and
goes
down
smoothly
but
isnt
very
drinkable
this
beer
features
far
too
much
alcohol
this
was
infinitely
better
the
first
time
i
had
it
this
bottle
let
me
down
rochefort
is
02
on
the
evening
the
mouthfeel
is
nice
and
full
and
has
just
the
right
kick
with
the
high
abv
and
overall
this
is
the
perfect
beer
nice
smooth
and
very
drinkable
in
the
tasting
i
tied
both
westy
12
and
rochefort
10
but
i
am
putting
rochefort
10
ahead
in
this
review
for
one
huge
reason
i
can
purchase
rochefort
10
at
any
point
during
the
year
about
3
miles
away
from
where
i
currently
live
just
makes
this
beer
even
better
knowing
i
dont
have
to
tradespend
ridiculous
amounts
of
money
in
shipping
to
get
ahold
of
it
in
the
top
three
beers
i
have
ever
had
d
amazing
drinkability
it
keeps
getting
better
as
it
warms
a
bit
the
smoothness
of
the
beer
is
still
baffling
considering
its
abv
it
may
be
a
slow
sipper
but
ill
definitely
drink
more
of
this
one
a
good
beer
to
pair
up
with
some
deserving
food
cheers
great
beer
with
lots
of
complexity
drinkability
very
this
is
an
outstanding
beer
with
so
many
levels
in
it
the
flavors
are
robust
and
subtle
at
the
sme
time
and
as
the
beer
sat
and
warmed
it
became
better
and
better
it
should
be
sipped
savored
and
enjoyed
holy
crap
i
have
seen
this
beer
on
the
top
100
and
have
been
wanting
to
try
it
i
tried
the
8
an
was
not
super
impressed
but
this
beer
blew
me
away
on
top
of
all
this
i
can
barely
taste
the
extremely
high
amount
of
alcohol
that
this
beer
possesses
d
outstanding
beer
and
one
of
my
favourites
complex
rich
and
memorable
but
i
could
never
imagine
drinking
more
than
one
at
one
sitting
it
is
truly
a
lovely
beer
and
i
especially
like
the
high
abv
as
i
sit
in
my
house
on
another
10
degree
fahrenheit
day
nb
goes
great
with
blue
cheese
overall
an
amazing
brew
this
is
a
true
craft
beer
and
im
thankful
to
the
generations
of
monks
who
have
put
their
heart
and
soul
into
this
chimay
is
better
as
is
st
bernardus
ive
had
a
couple
quads
and
have
had
mixed
feelings
about
them
still
getting
to
know
the
style
i
guess
fucking
world
class
brew
everything
about
this
quadrupel
is
amazing
pours
a
rusty
brown
booming
with
heavy
tones
of
yeast
dark
sugars
raisins
berry
fruits
and
alcohol
taste
follows
with
malts
pepper
spice
and
caramel
at

abv
this
has
a
difinite
kick
d
trains
gonna
sip
and
enjoy
and
let
the
alcohol
keep
me
warm
along
the
tracks
best
by
515
so
bottled
in
510
d
savor
share
explore
and
enjoy
fantastic
beer
one
of
the
best
in
my
opinion
critique
greater
complexity
and
a
longer
finish
classic
nonetheless
d
i
love
this
go
get
one
very
enjoyable
beer
to
drink
at
11
3
abv
youre
only
going
to
have
one
but
its
takes
a
while
to
sip
it
anyway
different
flavors
in
each
sip
even
more
as
it
warms
in
the
glass
definitely
one
to
enjoyed
over
an
extended
period
d
this
is
one
to
sip
but
each
sip
packs
such
a
punch
that
it
makes
this
a
brew
to
be
reckoned
with
im
not
always
a
big
fan
of
high
abv
brews
nor
all
that
belgium
has
to
offer
but
this
ones
a
keeper
yum
this
beer
is
very
drinkable
and
gets
better
as
it
warms
even
with
its
high
abv
this
beer
goes
down
well
10
cheers
for
rochefort
d
goes
down
smooth
and
pleasantly
leaves
me
satisfied
and
content
after
just
one
but
still
wanting
more
in
fact
i
may
have
to
grab
a
few
the
next
time
a
go
out
to
cellar
a
couple
i
havent
had
this
in
about
a
year
and
that
was
fresh
although
i
like
the
10
alot
i
prefer
some
of
the
other
similar
beers
a
bit
more
i
tried
this
one
fairly
early
in
my
craft
beer
drinking
career
this
was
probably
my
fifth
and
oldest
although
certainly
could
handle
a
couple
of
years
without
problem
and
on
par
with
previous
bottles
it
probably
is
one
of
my
top
3
favorite
beers
and
really
exemplifies
why
this
style
is
currently
my
favorite
it
will
be
interesting
to
try
it
next
to
my
recently
acquired
westy
12
if
it
wasnt
6
a
bottle
i
could
drink
it
weekly
this
is
the
type
of
beer
that
i
would
like
to
drink
with
a
nice
steak
the
flavor
is
very
powerful
so
it
can
be
enjoyed
next
to
other
strong
flavors
d
well
all
things
being
said
this
beer
s
at
the
top
of
my
list
i
could
drink
maybe
two
of
them
but
that
would
be
a
heavenly
two
drinks
after
that
i
would
want
to
move
on
to
something
a
little
less
good
as
to
not
adulterate
the
quad
with
drunken
haziness
drinkability
where
i
was
nervous
at
first
looking
at
the
11
i
found
this
to
be
a
wonderful
beer
well
carbonated

drinkability
and
smoothness
are
off
the
charts
for
a
beer
with
such
a
high
abv
that
is
so
young
the
malt
complexities
in
the
aroma
and
flavor
are
staggering
this
one
is
great
but
in
a
different
way
i
think
the
extra
abv
may
mask
some
of
the
flavors
youd
find
in
the
8
or
in
other
bsdas
the
alcohol
is
a
bit
more
present
in
this
brew
but
its
still
a
deceptively
easy
beer
to
drink
its
velvety
smooth
with
just
the
right
amount
of
carbonation
its
a
bread
like
malty
beer
a
bit
medicinal
due
to
the
high
abv
but
that
imparts
a
slight
very
very
slight
smokiness
some
fruity
esters
produces
a
bit
of
a
grape
flavor
aroma
is
crisp
strong
fruity
and
malty
with
just
a
whisper
of
sweetness
it
pours
a
hazy
barely
translucent
dark
coppery
brown
with
a
very
thick
and
pale
tan
head
flavor
is
malty
and
fruity
with
a
hint
of
caramel
and
a
fierce
but
not
overwhelming
alcohol
bite
texture
is
very
smooth
yet
quite
fizzy
and
tingly
leaving
a
satisfying
and

as

is
a

brew

so
obviously
based

ones

similar
to
but
stronger
and
less
carbonated
in

aspect
than
r8
which
although
good
is
like
r10
diluted
with
water
its
not
nearly
as
fruity
as
st
bernardus
abt
12
and
lacks
the
aristocratic
silkiness
of
westwleteren
which
hides
the
alcohol
better
and
is
more
refined
thick
malty
body
is
lightly
crispy
and
even
so
velvety
smooth
and
creamy
as
it
goes
down
apart
from
mostly
unobtrusive
alcohol
presence
the
beer
is
highly
enjoyable
and
very
drinkable
for
such
a
sheer
ale
the
monster
is
still
young
and
somewhat
unhewn
in
terms
of
mouthfeel
and
drinkability
but
who
knows
what
might
evolve
to
taking
some
nap
in
the
cellar
poured
form
bottle
to
chalice
the
color
of
roasted
chestnut
with
a
two
finger
head
that
stayed
around
as
a
nice
lacing
on
my
glass
with
a
shimmer
form
the
carbonation
the
aroma
was
of
fig
spices
and
other
earthy
tones
the
tastes
was
of
dark
fruit
and
earth
lots
of
booze
a
sipper
not
a
session
beer
the
carbonation
was
prickly
rochefort
uses
and
incredible
yeast
strain
that
make
all
there
beers
world
class
this
might
be
the
best
beer
i
have
ever
had
in
my
life
all
in
all
this
is
a
nice
brew
glad
i
picked
one
up
this
is
a
good
brew
if
youre
looking
for
something
not
as
heavy
as
a
stout
but
not
as
light
as
a
standard
ale
or
sweet
like
a
barleywine
this
is
a
thinking
beer
if
youre
looking
for
a
good
one
to
savor
and
figure
out
as
you
sip
it
beer
is
big
bodied
no
aftertaste
at
all
there
are
no
hops
to
detect
and
bitterness
overall
is
really
mild
there
is
a
tinge
of
alcohol
and
solvency
in
the
front
of
the
beer
and
that
really
disappoints
me
beer
gets
better
and
solvency
is
lessened
as
the
beer
warms
slightly
mouthfeel
is
ok
and
drinkabiliy
is
good
i
can
see
how
people
like
this
beer
but
it
has
not
been
my
favorite
quad
this
is
a
complex
beer
that
gets
better
and
better
as
it
warms
poured
a
deep

i
have
been
meaning
to
try
this
for
a
while
turbid
brown
despite
my
attempt
to
keep
the
yeast
out
almost
black
flimsy
head
it
smells
like
vinegar
and
pickles
at
first
but
as
it
warms
up
it
becomes
sweet
candied
spices
the
flavor
has
a
quadlike
sweetness
but
it
also
has
a
strong
black
licorice
quality
to
it
the
alcohol
is
not
blatant
but
i
know
it
is
there
because
i
can
feel
it
overall
i
liked
rochefort
8
more
just
a
fantastic
beer
experience
noteswow
i
adore
this
beer
its
everything
i
liked
about
the
6
and
the
8
but
combined
this
is
my
first
true
belgian
quad
and
i
could
not
reccomend
it
more
and
now
thats
ive
tried
the
rochefort
10
i
cant
wait
to
get
my
hands
on
st
bernardus
abt
12
and
westvleteren
12
overall
this
beer
really
does
deserve
all
the
hype
it
gets
it
probably
is
actually
a
little
underrated
since
it
is
so
widely
available
daniel
if
you
can
age
this
beer
do
it
a
have
a
few
more
at
this
age
and
hope
to
hold
on
to
one
for
atleast
10
years
one
of
the
better
darker
trappists
that
can
be
found
in
iowa
o
excellent
drinkability
the
definition
of
perfect
beer
for
me
d
a
topnotch
quad
its
massively
flavorful
and
complex
definitely
a
contemplative
brew
one
should
savor
despite
all
that
its
still
relatively
easy
to
drink
for
a
quad
as
the
carbonation
level
is
ideal
and
the
alcohol
doesnt
interfere
with
the
flavor
d
definate
sipper
you
want
to
enjoy
this
beer
as
it
warmsopens
up
as
it
opens
you
notice
that
the
flavors
and
smells
become
much
more
intense
the
high
carbonation
hinders
this
beer
but
after
cellaring
im
positive
this
will
be
an
awesome
beer
d
the
smell
is
constantly
a
bit
offputting
through
the
beer
and
in
regards
to
the
flavor
i
will
say
complexity
does
not
a
good
beer
make
with
that
said
i
also
think
its
very
well
brewed
but
the
flavors
seem
to
clash
just
a
bit
to
me
in
the
beginning
they
didnt
fit
at
all
but
they
grew
on
me
throughout
the
rest
of
the
beer
still
though
ive
had
more
enjoyable
quads
but
this
one
certainly
is
a
beer
to
behold
very
very
good
overall
d
a
fantastic
quad
that
defines
the
style
for
me
it
is
the
finest
belgian
i
have
ever
had
to
date
gorgeous
fruits
body
feel
and
balance
definitely
one
of
the
most
complex
beers
as
well
the
only
thing
holding
me
back
from
giving
this
perfect
5s
is
that
after
one
of
these
kinda
makes
you
feel
full
not
to
mention
the
alcohol
sneaks
up
on
you
too
simply
delicious
stuff
though
this
is
as
drinkable
as
i
would
imagine
an
11
beer
to
get
i
could
get
in
trouble
quick
with
this
one
if
my
wallet
would
allow
it
a
beautiful
beer
that
sets
the
tone
for
all
quads
to
measure
up
to
dpretty
hot
if
you
had
a
year
or
two
to
sit
this
thing
down
it
would
have
gotten
a
higher
scorebut
overall
great
beer
medium
bodied
and
only
lightly
carbonated
the
only
low
point
for
me
was
that
the
taste
seemed
just
a
little
underwhelming
but
that
was
only
because
the
aroma
was
simply
amazing
i
obviously
raised
my
expectations
a
little
too
high
after
that
so
i
cant
really
complain
a
great
sipper
for
sure
and
ill
be
interested
to
try
this
one
with
a
little
age
on
it
overall
honestly
i
am
disappointed
i
read
a
thread
recently
that
talked
about
how
great
this
beer
was
i
then
checked
its
spot
on
the
top
100
and
it
was
in
the
low
20s
i
believe
i
would
say
it
belongs
at
about
that
spot
to
me
this
beer
lacks
complexity
and
depth
compared
to
st
bernardus
abt
12
however
this
is
a
must
try
for
all
lovers
of
the
style
one
of
my
favorite
beers
of
all
time
d
there
are
no
overpowering
flavors
which
lets
this
beer
drink
pretty
easily
it
should
however
be
savored
both
to
experience
the
flavors
and
due
to
the
abv
o
great
beer
that
gets
better
as
it
approaches
room
temperature
i
would
have
given
it
a
better
score
if
the
oh
was
more
hidden
the
11
3
abv
makes
this
completely
understandable
d
this
is
a
great
sipper
its
really
warming
and
full
dvery
tasty
makes
me
want
to
sip
and
i
do
slowly
normally
im
a
fast
drinker
thick
full
bodied
beer
with
a
nice
warming
effect
and
great
flavor
d
a
really
great
experience
that
makes
you
want
to
drink
more
and
more
of
it
notes
a
seriously
tasty
quad
didnt
expect
the
cherry
flavors
but
they
are
appreciated
yes
i
know
theres
none
added
poured
from
the
bottle
into
my
snifter
this
beer
has
a
nice
big
creamy
head
it
is
a
murky
brown
and
when
held
to
the
light
the
edges
reveal
some
particles
but
of
what
im
not
sure
there
is
a
lasting
ring
around
the
glass
and
some
nice
lacing
the
smell
is
great
rich
and
chocolately
with
some
dark
fruit
kind
of
like
a
deeper
richer
doppelbock
this
is
one
of
the
bestsmelling
beers
ive
ever
had
the
taste
is
also
chocolate
with
a
slight
bit
of
alcohol
in
the
background
although
it
doesnt
burn
for
the
amount
of
alcohol
in
the
beer
i
can
feel
it
warming
my
stomach
nice
as
it
warms
i
get
a
hint
of
skunk
flavor
im
not
sure
how
long
this
has
been
on
the
shelf
but
it
could
be
a
bit
lightstruck
mouthfeel
is
smooth
on
the
tongue
but
carbonation
is
a
little
harsh
as
it
goes
down
my
throat
drinkability
would
be
pretty
good
on
this
except
for
the
price
and
amount
of
alcohol
i
would
look
forward
to
having
this
again
d
wwwaaaayyyy
to
easy
to
drink
this
beer
is
delicious
there
is
no
taste
of
alcohol
no
heat
from
alcohol
if
i
didnt
know
better
i
could
easily
get
myself
into
trouble
with
this
beer
it
goes
down
very
easy
d
this
crowning
jewel
of
the
trappist
beers
is
surprisingly
drinkable
despite
the
high
abv
just
lovely
overall
this
is
a
complex
and
intriguing
brew
with
rich
aromas
and
flavors
alot
smoother
than
expected
with
the
high
abv
d
i
could
probably
drink
a
six
pack
of
these
on

cold

night
out
on
the

with

by

a
robust
warming
caramel
and
chocolate
cake
finish
subtle
boozy
kiss
less
fruity
and
more
dessert
like
than
many
quads
of
my
fancy
much
less
dark
fruit
and
body
than
both
the
cuvee
van
de
kaiser
and
st
bernardus
12
interesting
vanilla
notes
d
for
how
strong
it
is
and
how
blatantly
the
alcohol
presents
itself
it
is
very
drinkable
i
finished
one
in
about
ten
minutes
and
could
easily
have
had
a
couple
more
excellent
beer
maybe
the
best
quad
that
i
have
tried
which
isnt
very
many
d
not
high
have
only
one
and
sip
it
allow
it
to
warm
the
finish
for
this
dreamboat
is
that
of
a
full
heavy
bodied
belgian
ale
with
a
boozy
sweetness
that
holds
onto
the
tongue
after
the
beer
is
gone
this
is
an
absolutely
amazing
example
of
what
great
trappist
beer
can
and
should
be
and
i
will
be
drinking
these
periodicaly
for
years
to
come
d
this
is
one
of
the
best
quads
that
ive
had
so
far
i
think
this
will
be
my
new
baseline
beer
for
quads
either
way
this
is
a
must
try
beer
this
is
a
good
reason
to
get
into
trading
man
what
a
beer
i
can
see
why
this
one
is
so
highly
regarded
very
tasty
the
strength
makes
it
hard
to
drink
a
lot
but
the
pleasure
makes
it
easy
to
want
to
try
your
luck
overall
a
really
good
beer
that
may
be
a
bit
more
complex
than
the
abt
12
however
the
larger
alcohol
presence
and
the
sweeter
finish
makes
it
less
enjoyable
for
me
i
have
another
one
that
i
will
age
to
see
if
that
helps
the
alcohol
a
bit
but
still
this
is
a
great
quad
that
is
classic
dark
brown
color
with
medium
tan
head
aroma
of
malt
nuts
and
some
berries
full
smooth
flavor
with
enormous
complexity
grows
even
more
complex
and
fullflavored
with
35
years
of
consistent
storage
approaches
westvleteren
12
in
terms
of
flavor
and
complexity
a
true
classic
overall
this
is
a
very
very
tasty
and
complex
brew
hellawellbalanced
and
the
tastes
and
smells
are
masterfully
blended
together
call
me
crazy
though
but
i
think
i
prefer
the
8
regardless
i
wouldnt
complain
if
i
had
to
choose
this
is
a
great
beer
drinkability
this
went
down
very
smooth
especially
for
a
quad
i
did
not
notice
the
alcohol
in
the
aroma
nor
taste
i
did
notice
it
in
my
head
a
little
later
pours
a
deep
dark
murky
brown
with
lots
of
yeasty
floaties
and
a
nice
beige
head
aroma
of
alcohol
raisins
plums
pears
prunes
and
the
list
goes
on
tastes
mostly
like
the
smell
minus
the
alcohol
is
well
hidden
until
the
somewhat
burn
of
a
swallow
notes
of
vanilla
flavored
malts
and
figs
also
wonderfully
balanced
and
super
smooth
lives
up
to
the
hype
for
sure
i
have
to
be
honest
when
i
say
that
this
one
is
almost
or
evenbetter
than
the
westvleteren
12
its
darker
gives
more
foam
in
the
glass
and
for
a
longer
time
the
aftertasteis
superb
like
i
have
already
said
before
i
like
the
blond
beers
better
but
this
one
is
really
really
really
super
and
its
very
easy
to
get
in
holland
and
belgium
if
you
seek
for
the
best
beer
this
is
the
one
amongst
others
drinkability
think
of
it
as
a
foretaste
of
heaven
complex
and
all
the
flavors
are
wonderfully
blended
together
the
words
delicious
awesome
and
stunning
seem
to
fall
short
of
how
to
describe
this
brew
heavenly
this
brew
rebounds
in
flavor
yet
is
a
bit
nondescript
lots
of
cherry
and
chocolate
are
evident
on
the
tongue
yet
the
complexities
are
thin
this
beer
looks
good
but
doesnt
excite
a
bit
too
sweet
in
the
end
i
think
there
is
a
coverup
of
sorts
going
on
ill
stick
to
st
bernardus
12
in
the
future
nonetheless
sickly
drinkable
for
its
strength
and
a
revisit
with
another
batch
shows
much
more
complexity
in
the
aroma
and
a
nice
feel
updated
fresh
in
brussels
all
bets
are
off
as
this
may
be
the
best
quad
out
there
d
with
11
abv
so
well
hidden
keep
the
third
out
of
reach
d
definitely
a
one
at
a
time
beer
for
me
i
am
almost
done
with
the
glass
as
i
review
this
and
i
feel
the
effects
of
the
11
30
this
is
my
first
review
but
not
my
first
rochefort
10
taste
improved
as
it
warms
up
too
i
usually
start
mine
fridge
temp
pour
wait
about
a
minute
or
2
and
slowly
enjoy
it
definately
a
need
to
try
im
loving
this
beer
so
much
going
on
here
i
feel
humbled
by
this
one
i
just
dont
think
im
getting
the
whole
picture
here
i
can
only
wonder
what
this
would
be
like
after
a
decade
in
a
cellar
as
hard
as
i
would
try
i
just
dont
think
i
could
avoid
drinking
it
for
that
long
drinkability
is
good
but
not
great
due
to
the
abv
overall
a
great
beer
as
far
as
quadrupels
go
this
is
undoubtedly
top
notch
taking
first
place
in
my
little
tasting
if
they
only
sold
this
at
the
monastery
it
would
be
1
on
every
beer
website
the
very
solid
a
it
has
however
is
very
fair
indeed
all
in
all
very
drinkable
if
you
can
handle
the
complexity
and
alcohol
the
kings
of
hop
a
nice
dark
brown
with
some
sediment
and
about
a
finger
of
khaki
head
smells
of
dark
fruits
some
brown
sugar
and
alcohol
taste
is
warming
and
malty
some
plums
a
good
sweetness
the
mouthfeel
is
nice
and
creamy
smooth
full
body
nice
and
drinkable
for
the
amount
of
alcohol
my
first
trappist
beer
and
all
in
all
i
wasnt
terribly
impressed
it
was
good
dont
get
me
wrong
but
not
as
good
as
i
thought
it
was
going
to
be
drinkability
the
abv
keeps
pretty
much
anyone
from
having
more
than
3
without
getting
wasted
its
like
a
bong
hit
in
a
bottle
overall
a
very
good
beer
that
everyone
should
try
and
try
repeated
times
a
smooth
easy
drinking
example
of
the
style
d
so
smooth
and
goes
down
really
easy
i
cannot
believe
how
well
the
alcohol
is
covered
i
love
the
warm
feeling
it
leaves
in
my
chest
this
has
the
characteristics
of
a
sipper
but
i
could
definitely
drink
more
than
one
and
pay
for
it
in
the
morning
else
drinkable
this
is
my
favourite
beer
of
all
time
bottle
aged
to
at
least
7
months
preferably
i
just
love
the
fruity
esters
and
earthy
qualities
of
this
beer
dangerously
drinkable
i
make
it
my
aim
to
have
some
in
stock
all
year
round
along
with
the
equally
delicious
rochefort
8
overall
this
rochefort
10
the
crown
of
the
rochefort
line
represents
the
essence
of
trappist
brewing
but
then
all
7
trappist
breweries
really
hit
the
nail
on
the
head
rochefort
has
been
doing
it
right
for
over
400
years
the
rochefort
brewery
opened
in
1595
and
is
the
oldest
trappist
brewery
by
250
years
apparently
practice
makes
perfect
di
am
really
enjoying
this
brew
ive
had
this
a
few
times
but
this
is
the
oldest
bottle
at
one
year
could
definitely
have
more
than
one
d
considering
the
heartiness
and
strength
of
this
beer
it
is
very
easy
to
drink
in
small
quanities
i
love
cool
weather
it
makes
beers
like
this
really
shine
superbly
drinkable
for
a
brew
this
size
very
complex
and
engaging
makes
for
a
nice
combination
in
most
any
situation
top
notch
md
decent
carbonation
that
tickles
the
throat
smooth
but
lighter
bodied
than
i
expected
even
with
its
strength
i
could
easily
drink
more
than
one
and
feel
great
about
it
rich
warm
complex
sublime
this
is
a
topnotch
ale
that
is
to
be
reckoned
with
very
smooth
hardly
strong
and
very
fine
something
to
be
had
with
a
fine
red
meat
and
lots
of
veggies
i
am
impressed
and
have
never
had
anything
like
it
ever
in
the
u
s
worth
the
buy
over
and
over
d
delicious
and
dangerous
but
so
big
and
complex
i
dont
think
i
could
drink
a
bunch
d
enjoyable
not
my
favorite
style
but
the
balance
is
very
appreciated
procured
at
beverages
more
valencia
ca
mouth
feel
is
fullbodied
and
coats
the
tongue
it
is
balanced
with
a
very
mild
prickliness
that
gives
the
beer
a
great
feel
and
drinkability
especially
for
11
3
abv
overall
another
quality
trappist
ale
i
am
a
fan
though
the
styles
are
basically
the
same
the
10
is
superior
to
the
8
in
my
opinion
tons
of
sweet
spice
and
a
combination
of
green
and
ripe
fruits
are
abundant
there
is
so
much
going
on
here
only
a
slightly
hot
alcohol
bite
keeps
me
from
rating
this
one
higher
ive
never
had
st
berny
12
or
westy
12
but
i
am
a
big
chimay
blue
fan
and
i
think
this
one
trumps
it
d
when
i
want
a
quad
i
will
reach
for
this
or
at
least
i
would
if
it
were
available

this

a

should

the
high

my
search

and
craftsmanship
in
the
beer
universe
while
i
no
longer
find
it
to
be
mindblowing
there
is
nothing
disappointing
about
this
ale
it
remains
one
of
the
most
mature
if
not
sacred
examples
of
the
style
and
of
the
potential
of
beer
in
general
overall
a
definite
nuance
beer
i
could
and
would
love
to
spend
many
many
nights
trying
to
unravel
it

a
deep
hazy

a
thick
frothy

of
fruit
banana
and
brown
sugar
and
molasses
light
scent

hides

alcohol
quite
well
coats
the
mouth
in
a
nice
flavor
that
lasts
definitely
lives
up
to
its
reputation
overall
a
worldclass
beer
and
one
that
i
would
put
headtohead
with
any
wine
in
the
world
as
a
complex
sophisticated
drink
to
pair
with
a
fine
cheese
or
meal
pours
dark
brown
with
an
inch
of
white
head
smells
and
tastes
like
spicy
fruitcake
apples
grapes
and
candi
sugar
body
is
medium
with
finely
granulated
carbonation
highly
drinkable
beer
that
conceals
its
high
abv
quite
well
this
is
my
first
time
drinking
a
rochefort
10
didnt
realize
i
had
such
a
tasty
belgian
brew
so
easily
accessible
d
pretty
high
although
it
gets
to
be
a
bit
much
relative
to
westy
12
which
i
can
down
like
water
this
beer
takes
a
long
time
to
drink
because
it
just
isnt
good
its
no
good
and
i
dont
recommend
it
and
i
never
thought
id
say
that
about
a
trappist
beer
but
there
you
go
and
i
deeply
and
sincerely
mean
it
go
buy
the
8
instead
if
you
like
trappists
its
much
better
superb
d
this
one
is
just
not
for
me
and
i
have
a
hard
time
imagining
other
people
drinking
it
i
think
i
need
to
go
on
a
belgian
vacation
for
a
while
drinkability
i
really
love
this
stuff
however
the
alcohol
is
quite
present
in
a
way
that
is
almost
off
putting
there
are
other
readily
available
belgian
quads
st
b
that
hide
the
alcohol
for
less
than
or
equal
to
the
price
of
this
in
this
style
category
i
demand
perfection
and
while
i
think
this
is
excellent
its
not
perfect
been
waiting
for
a
day
of
significance
to
drink
the
last
remaining
in
my
stock
but
i
guess
the
end
of
the
summer
vacation
shall
suffice
pours
very
dark
the
darkest
of
browns
that
can
still
fall
into
the
category
the
head
is
light
tan
with
swirls
of
brown
in
it
some
sediment
finds
its
way
to
the
top
after
a
while
and
forms
a
gang
lacing
is
modest
but
available
smell
is
complex
maybe
too
complex
for
my
preception
at
this
point
but
im
getting
a
lot
of
dried
fruit
rumlike
quality
pepper
and
the
booze
is
lined
up
in
there
the
taste
is
excellent
and
develops
as
the
temperature
climbs
plums
raisins
and
figs
with
an
alcoholic
kick
in
the
ass
soon
after
swallowing
the
mouth
is
very
creamy
yet
still
retains
more
of
a
medium
body
the
carbonation
was
a
bit
much
right
after
pouring
but
subsided
and
is
now
actually
a
bit
lacking
as
i
have
whittled
it
down
to
a
few
sips
left
this
is
nearly
irrelevant
as
the
creaminess
and
sustain
of
the
feel
are
wonderful
it
be
exciting
to
see
how
this
beer
turns
out
if
you
wait
the
recommended
five
years
or
so
they
suggest
all
in
all
this
is
a
complex
hearty
beer
that
drinks
quite
well
considering
the
high
abv
ill
be
returning
to
this
one
in
the
future
with
more
perspective
and
knowledge
on
the
style
glad
i
finally
got
around
to
trying
this
d
a
fantastic
sipping
beer
the
alcohol
content
luckily
keeps
it
from
being
too
drinkable
but
its
an
excellent
beer
to
sit
back
with
and
let
the
flavors
come
out
even
more
as
it
warms
d
excellent
so
smooth
that
i
could
drink
several
the
alcohol
is
well
hidden
notes
tremendous
beer
this
is
one
of
those
showoffs
that
can
withstand
all
the
reputation
of
a
style
one
may
need
to
be
into
beers
of
this
complexity
sweetness
and
alcoholic
content
meaning
that
it
may
be
tough
to
offer
it
out
of
the
blue
to
untested
palates
but
id
be
glad
to
try
it
share
it
and
keep
on
enjoying
it
overall
a
very
enjoyable
beer
for
this
novice
i
highly
recommend
it
its
a
very
complex
beer
thatll
have
you
wondering
how
they
can
pack
so
many
different
flavors
into
one
beer
yet
balance
it
so
well
heaven
in
a
bottle
absolute
sipper
pretty
big
abv
and
its
tasted
does
it
live
up
to
the
hype
i
would
say
probably
yes
i
need
to
have
it
again
to
say
that
right
now
i
can
think
of
another
quad
i
would
have
over
this
outstanding
beer
none
the
less
im
sure
if
you
are
someone
who
enjoy
quad
beers
than
this
would
be
good
but
just
not
for
me
330ml
brown
bottle

scents
of
fruity
citrusy
tinge
and
the
slightest
hint
of
chocolate
graces
the
nose
tastes
of
peaches
chocolate
citrus
orange
maybe
moderately
carbonated
one
of
the
best
quads
out
there
im
glad
i
got
two
of
them
even
if
they
were
6
each
i
will
definitely
be
getting
this
again
whenever
i
can
find
it
it
was
worth
the
wait
and
the
45
minute
drive
to
get
one
bottle
pours
a
very
dark
brown
with
very
little
light
passing
through
has
a
thin
tan
head
aroma
is
a
complex
array
of
dark
fruits
mostly
prune
and
plum
mouthfeel
is
thin
bodied
with
a
fair
amount
of
carbonation
flavor
is
very
complex
has
dark
fruit
flavors
alchohol
dark
chocolate
caramel
spiciness
cola
like
features
and
is
very
fruity
on
the
finish
overall
this
is
a
great
beer
the
only
way
to
balance
it
more
would
be
to
have
less
alcohol
strength
or
a
little
more
balance
between
the
dark
fruit
flavors
and
dark
malt
sweetness
still
a
solid
beer
this
beer
pours
a
cloudy
deep
amberbrown
a
two
finger
of
nice
frothy
heads
sits
on
top
with
excellent
head
retention
thick
sheets
sometimes
streaky

the
side
of
the

the
entire
way
down
a
bit
of

noticeable
in
the
head
nose
is
of
dark
fruits
some
raising
and
plums

sugar
and
a
touch
boozy
taste
is
of
dark
fruits
up

they
were
soaked
in
alcohol
raisins
plums
and
cherries
dominate
caramel
and
toffee
malts
with
a
touch
of

finish
is
a
bit
nutty
with
some

to
it
alcohol
is
present
warms
you
but
doesnt
overpower
medium
bodied
medium
carbonation
nice
thick
and
smooth
alcohol
warms
but
the
beer
is
so
tasty
you
have
to
watch
out
this
is
a
great
beer
for
my
first
quad
this
is
quite
nice
and
enjoyable
a
definite
benchmark
for
other
quadrupels
d
there
is
little
wonder
why
this
beer
is
held
in
such
high
esteem
it
is
one
of
those
beers
that
has
to
be
experienced
openly
powerful
in
the
alcohol
but
brilliantly
balanced
with
strong
rich
flavours
i
have
three
more
of
these
that
i
am
cellaring
and
im
finding
it
very
hard
not
to
drink
them
d
good
for
one
glass
wich
is
probably
what
the
brewers
intended
couoldnt
imagine
drinking
a
few
in
one
night
what
an
amazing
brew
the
first
i
chose
to
review
here
on
ba
as
well
as
on
my
own
little
review
show
i
put
together
pours
a
great
dark
creamy
color
with
little
lacing
not
very
high
on
carbonation
which
makes
sense
with
the
high
abv
11
3
lots
of
yeast
floating
around
which
is
a
beautiful
thing
the
taste
is
so
nice
yet
for
a
beer
this
strong
surprisingly
mellow
lots
of
dark
sugars
and
sweetness
yet
all
of
which
is
mellow
the
smell
was
nice
as
well
but
it
did
not
have
quite
as
much
of
a
smell
as
you
would
think
overall
a
great
brew
a
intensely
dark
with
only
a
slight
red
tinge
on
the
edges
creamy
off
wite
head
dark
chocolate
liqorice
molasses
and
some
fig
aromas
hop
aromas
are
kind
of
muted
a
touch
more
restrained
than
i
expected
but
still
insanely
good
comes
together
in
perfect
balance
on
the
palate
alcohol
is
warming
some
medicinal
flavours
there
too
chocolate
and
fig
vibes
in
harmony
with
the
serious
bitterness
low
carbonation
helps
the
divine
creaminess
of
this
beer
truly
awesome
one
to
savour
this
been
is
amazing
i
havent
had
a
westy
12
in
about
3
years
but
i
hardly
see
how
it
could
be
better
than
this
a
dark
muddy
brown
color
body
with
two
fingers
of
fluffy
light
tan
lasting
head
loads
of
sheeting
and
lacing
lots
of
tiny
carbonation
bubbles
aroma
of
dark
fruit
grapes
and
berries
earthy
hopstoffee
and
caramel
and
wood
flavor
is
sweet
and
spicy
lots
of
earthy
roasted
malt
hops
and
bread
dough
rasins
plums
and
apples
very
complex
and
well
rounded
full
body
with
a
creamy
yet
lite
mouthfeel
mildly
bitter
and
dry
at
the
finish
very
drinkable
and
good
is
all
areas
nice
overall
possibly
better
than
the
tw12
which
is
saying
a
lot
i
tried
to
drink
this
a
bit
too
cold
when
i
started
and
i
realized
pretty
quickly
i
had
to
let
it
warm
a
bit
to
bring
out
the
full
flavor
be
warned
pours
a
deep
brown
with
burgandy
hints
a
huge
amount
of
initial
head
some
nice
lacing
and
a
glop
of
sediment
into
the
middle
of
the
foam
great
scent
a
huge
hit
of
fig
with
an
earthy
brown
ale
scent
thick
and
rich
with
a
huge
maltiness
excellent
taste
as
well
very
barleywinish
with
its
deep
and
thick
malt
flavor
but
with
a
nice
slight
sweetness
and
nice
hints
of
fruit
especially
fig
goes
down
great
thick
and
great
without
a
hint
of
its
high
abv
great
beer
i
would
say
this
were
much
more
drinkable
if
it
werent
for
the
sharp
alcohol
bite
i
enjoyed
every
aspect
of
it
just
couldnt
handle
a
ton
need
friends
to
drink
this
beer
but
it
is
very
good
poured
from
a
bottle
into
a
pint
glass
poured
deep
brown
with
a
1
inch
tan
head
carbonation
is
very
noticeable
right
away
smells
of
dark
fruit
caramel
and
spices
tastes
of
heavy
malt
dark
fruit
and
spice
with
a
well
perceived
alcohol
hops
come
through
on
the
backend
to
balance
out
the
brew
mouthfeel
is
good
and
chewy
i
thought
drinkability
was
good
but
not
great
i
prefer
the
st
bernardus
abt
12
in
that
regard
the
alcohol
flavor
is
more
pronounced
in
the
rochefort
which
detracts
from
its
otherwise
wonderful
flavors
it
is
definitely
a
sipping
brew
and
i
would
definitely
have
another
given
a
chance
goes
great
with
a
nice
heavy
meal
poured
into
a
goblet
for
a
small
tan
head
resting
on
top
of
a
dark
brown
body
caramelized
malt
and
sugar
on
top
of
yeast
and
orangedark
fruits
all
hit
my
nose
great
smooth
and
creaminess
tucked
into
a
medium
body
there
is
a
sweetness
to
this
beer
from
caramel
and
sugary
candy
flavors
as
well
as
a
smoothness
derived
from
something
like
oakwood
which
is
noticeable
on
back
end
balanced
w
fruit
flavors
like
orange
and
some
figs
there
is
a
light
herbal
and
spicy
hop
presence
in
the
back
which
leads
to
a
balanced
beer
with
a
little
bit
of
a
dry
kick
the
abv
complements
the
backend
as
well
but
by
no
means
overpowers
the
beer
whatsoever
this
is
a
great
beer
to
sip
on
especially
after
a
meal
the
heavy
carbonation
pairs
well
with
the
thick
malty
body
and
equally
high
alcohol
i
have
one
aging
in
the
cellar
cant
wait
to
see
what
a
couple
of
years
do
to
this
bad
boy
d
though
its
a
sipper
id
drink
it
before
the
alcohol
rears
its
head
id
love
to
try
this
with
2
years
on
it
notes
i
much
prefer
this
brew
to
the
westvleteren
12
and
perhaps
the
best
beer
i
have
sampled
to
date
people
say
that
the
us
makes
the
best
beer
but
try
to
touch
the
belgians
ability
to
create
this
velvet
mouthfeel
and
play
with
the
yeasts
like
this
that
alone
is
proof
that
the
belgians
still
have
some
things
on
lock
jordan
a
booming
quad
fantastic
complex
deep
and
enjoyable
highly
recommended
would
love
to
drink
this
on
a
cool
fall
day
one
after
another
drinkabilty
notes
as
good
as
i
can
imagine
and
better
than
i
expected
i
have
yet
to
try
westy
but
this
was
the
best
i
have
ever
had
10
times
better
than
rochefort
8
get
all
you
can
if
you
find
it
late
not
apparently
there
were
2
sips
left
this
really
a
slow
drinking
beer
personally
this
is
one
of
my
personal
cherished
beers
i
like
to
have
a
bottle
every
year
to
age
for
the
next
holiday
season
rochefort
10
is
a
testament
to
the
excellence
and
taste
supremacy
of
belgian
beers
it
is
often
stated
that
this
beer
is
equal
or
superior
to
westy
12
but
i
dont
agree
with
that
one
bit
in
fact
i
would
go
so
far
as
to
say
it
shouldnt
be
even
be
mentioned
in
the
same
sentence
as
st
bernardus
12
or
pannepot
im
not
trying
to
trash
it
because
it
surely
is
a
high
quality
beer
but
it
is
not
world
class
according
to
my
palate
i
will
be
honest
as
i
have
sat
on
these
notes
for
3
weeks
now
i
feel
guilty
for
even
writing
this
so
many
good
reviews
and
i
just
flat
out
was
unhappy
with
this
beer
abv
was
too
high
for
me
i
think
i
will
try
the
8
and
try
this
again
it
may
not
be
a
beer
that
just
suits
me
and
that
i
get
i
got
too
much
alcohol
and
it
was
a
total
turn
off
to
me
d
wonderful
beer
im
not
normally
a
big
fan
of
quads
but
i
am
doing
my
best
to
try
all
of
the
trappist
ales
and
this
is
one
that
has
definitely
lived
up
to
the
billing
overall
a
great
beer
i
wish
the
trappistes
rocheforts
went
up
to
11
that
would
be
cool
fullbodied
and
smooth
on
the
palate
with
truly
wonderful
drinkability
a
very
enjoyable
beer
the
amount
of
alcohol
and
the
complexity
make
it
good
for
sipping
d
very
but
i
am
going
to
put
a
couple
of
bottles
in
the
celler
they
should
probably
develop
even
more
complexity
overall
wow
this
is
one
helluva
good
beer
if
it
wasnt
so
expensive
and
it
wasnt
quite
so
hard
to
find
id
be
drinking
this
a
lot
more
often
a
very
malty
undercarbonated
beer
for
the
belgian
style
i
do
like
the
alcohol
taste
in
a
quad
which
was
apparent
the
euro
barley
was
also
there
along
with
the
european
hop
addition
i
did
like
the
yeast
sediment
like
a
homebrew
and
which
that
more
beers
should
show
their
background
every
once
in
a
while
it
just
tasted
like
a
double
wiezenbock
i
wasnt
as
impressed
as
i
thought
id
be
mouthfeel
is
nicely
full
definitely
slightly
burning
towards
the
back
but
i
just
like
it
and
it
leaves
very
cleanly
with
a
nice
lightly
bitter
finish
overall
its
not
overwhelmingly
drinkable
because
of
that
alcomohol
but
enjoyable
as
a
good
scotch
and
nicely
belgian
in
complexity
a
very
very
pleasant
and
very
very
drinkable
beer
especially
considering
its
abv
very
slick
very
complex
and
amazingly
enjoyable
thankyou
laituegonflable
for
slapping
me
in
the
face
with
this
one
drinkability
after
drinking
this
beer
i
could
tell
that
they
sunk
more
money
into
the
beer
then
the
label
artwork
its
clearly
not
a
cheap
beer
but
if
you
ever
want
to
try
well
hidden
high
abv
beer
then
you
should
try
a
rochefort
10
for
me
i
would
like
to
give
this
beer
another
try
very
bready
big
thick
mouthfeel
really
solid
an
awesome
big
beer
the
11
3
is
really
well
covered
with
all
the
malt
and
different
flavors
one
of
the
best
quads
ive
ever
had
the
best
of
all
3
rochefort
beers
all
in
all
a
lot
more
than
the
rochefort
8
and
i
love
the
8
this
one
steps
everything
i
liked
about
the
8
up
in
a
big
way
while
not
overloading
the
tongue
whats
amazing
about
this
beer
is
how
bold
it
is
in
mouthfeel
aroma
and
character
while
providing
a
subduded
sweetness
a
true
artisan
beer
and
one
i
wont
think
twice
about
buying
a
boatload
of
d
at
11
abv
one
is
tough
to
finish
certianlly
a
sipper
i
am
just
getting
into
the
belgians
other
than
wits
lately
and
trying
to
learn
about
this
style
so
far
so
good
i
dont
ever
read
reviews
before
reviewing
cant
wait
until
i
do
to
see
what
others
have
seen
overall
one
of
the
best
quads
out
there
it
is
important
though
to
let
the
beer
warm
up
a
bit
so
all
the
flavours
are
fully
released
d
this
was
my
first
trappist
beer
and
i
must
say
i
am
very
pleased
i
highly
recommend
this
to
anyone
who
passes
by
it
in
the
store
or
sees
it
at
the
local
pub
i
could
easily
have
23
of
these
in
one
sitting
d
too
wonderful
to
guzzle
and
it
hits
like
a
rock
but
its
sooo
easy
to
drink
10
pours
a
medium
brown
with
a
generous
head
that
doesnt
last
long
i
smell
pears
and
alcohol
the
flavor
is
of
dark
ripe
fruit
and
molasses
nice
and
sweet
with
no
bitterness
at
all
there
is
a
fair
amount
of
carbonation
it
is
not
a
heavy
feel
beer
i
could
drink
a
few
of
these
if
i
could
afford
it
this
was
my
third
trial
of
rochefort
10
and
while
a
liked
it
i
wanted
to
wait
to
make
sure
i
wasnt
missing
something
i
actually
liked
bernardus
12
better
although
i
have
a
feeling
if
i
had
the
willpower
to
cellar
this
it
could
be
very
special
overall
a
deliciious
brew
perfect
digestive
wonderful
example
of
the
style
bottom
line
the
rochefort
10
is
a
killer
quad
one
i
would
love
to
enjoy
again
one
that
is
particularly
appropriate
for
the
most
special
of
occasions
in
all
this
sturm
und
drang
one
is
left
to
wonder
where
went
the
heat
like
its
little
brother
the
8
you
have
to
reflect
somewhat
in
order
to
detect
the
alcohol
beyond
a
slight
general
warming
perceived
drinkability
will
not
equal
actual
endgame
drinkability
with
this
one
of
that
i
am
certain
still
drink
this
just
because
you
damned
well
can
pours
a
deep
brown
color
with
a
thick
tan
head
aroma
of
fruit
sweet
candy
and
alcohol
flavor
is
raisiny
with
alcohol
figs
plums
grapes
and
other
dark
fruits
yeast
and
more
alcohol
round
this
one
out
champagnish
fizzyness
finishes
dry
but
with
a
tart
sweetness
at
the
end
of
the
finish
good
d
a
fantastic
beer
a
fantastic
trappistbeer
of
all
the
trappistbeers
i
had
i
guess
the
only
ones
that
can
compete
with
this
one
is
westmalle
dubbel
and
tripel
if
you
find
this
one
in
the
store
or
pub
buy
it

this
is
the
best
beer
in
the
world
pours
a
very
dark
brown
with
a
medium

aroma
is
caramel
and
toffee
with
notes
of
apples

very

noticeable

warmth

a
dry

long
lasting
pleasant
aftertaste
very
very
good
mouthfeel
is
full
bodied
delicious
balanced
and
complex
this
is
a
quad
and
its
obviously
a
sipper
but
its
pretty
drinkable
i
could
drink
this
all
night
excellent
this
is
very
good
beer
my
first
impression
is
very
very
good
but
the
8
was
incredible
i
immediately
followed
the
10
by
pouring
another
8
and
it
confirmed
my
judgment
the
8
is
a
world
class
beer
and
the
10
is
an
excellent
beer
frankly
i
wanted
the
10
to
be
better
than
the
8
but
it
isnt
a
very
good
beer
truly
but
the
abv
gets
in
the
way
in
the
10
that
it
does
not
in
the
8
i
have
5
more
bottles
that
i
will
let
age
in
my
cellar
and
report
on
changes
over
time
in
the
near
term
i
will
try
another
10
the
sixth
in
the
cellarthat
i
will
let
warm
a
little
first
finally
a
store
in
the
area
has
the
8
for
3
29
a
bottle
i
am
going
there
and
buying
every
last
bottle
they
have
i
will
put
the
warmed
10
headtohead
with
the
st
bernardus
abt
12
shortly
and
include
the
8
in
the
session
ill
revise
my
review
if
necessary
this
si
a
very
complex
and
thought
provoking
brew
nice
to
sip
on
and
relax
with
a
fine
peaceful
evening
mouthfeel
was
medium
bodied
i
definately
cant
drink
more
than
1
of
these
without
feeling
the
buzz
another
good
beer
ill
have
to
try
again
i
was
really
really
hoping
for
more
from
this
beer
as
it
rates
so
high
from
other
consumers
i
was
fairly
disappointed
by
the
taste
when
the
smell
was
so
pleasing
i
would
get
again
but
at
almost
8
a
pop
my
money
would
go
elsewhere
first
mouthfeel
prickley
carbonation
and
warming
alcohol
i
am
so
glad
that
i
finally
drank
what
can
only
be
descibed
as
a
nectar
of
the
gods
when
i
die
and
if
there
is
a
heaven
and
for
some
reason
st
peter
opens
the
pearly
gates
for
me
i
can
only
hope
that
this
beer
is
available
but
if
i
have
to
head
in
the
opposite
direction
for
eternity
maybe
the
ruler
of
the
underworld
will
have
a
few
cellered
that
he
would
be
willing
to
part
with
drinkability
considering
style
is
spectacular
i
have
finished
the
11
2
ounces
in
the
time
it
has
taken
to
form
this
review
this
beer
pours
dark
brown
in
color
with
a
three
finger
head
and
nice
lacing
the
smell
is
sweet
with
plums
and
raisins
tastes
of
dark
fruits
and
finishes
with
a
spicy
and
hoppy
flavor
similar
to
the
taste
that
gingerbread
leaves
in
your
mouth
i
can
taste
many
similarities
to
red
wine
the
mouthfeel
is
silky
and
smooth
and
is
perfectly
carbinated
drinkability
is
limited
only
by
the
high
abv
i
wish
i
would
of
not
started
drinking
this
quite
so
cold
this
just
keeps
getting
better
a
must
try
the
guys
at
rochefort
really
should
let
this
one
age
for
awhile
before
shipping
it
out
they
are
really
shooting
themselves
in
the
foot
by
shipping
it
out
so
young
i
read
that
this
one
goes
from
grain
to
bottle
in
3
weeks
all
the
elements
of
a
great
beer
are
there
but
they
are
just
so
disseperate
that
its
a
little
like
trying
to
piece
together
a
puzzle
i
have
had
this
beer
fairly
frequently
over
the
past
10
years
but
have
never
sat
down
to
review
it
till
now
i
received
a
bottle
as
a
gift
and
poured
into
my
trappistes
rochefort
chalice
the
color
is
a
dark
amber
with
about
a
half
inch
head
i
pour
the
whole
bottle
so
there
is
noticeable
sediment
the
smell
is
like
christmas
morning
a
sweet
blend
of
clove
anise
dried
fruit
and
alcohol
the
taste
evolves
with
every
sip
with
a
masterful
blend
of
raisin
plum
clove
anise
among
other
spices
and
a
warming
alcohol
finish
its
truly
one
of
the
few
beers
that
seem
to
evolve
with
each
sip
the
mouthfeel
is
soft
and
smooth
a
little
on
the
chewy
side
the
high
alcohol
content
is
expertly
masked
by
all
the
sweetness
and
complex
flavors
there
is
just
so
much
to
say
about
this
beer
and
yet
words
really
fail
to
do
it
the
proper
justice
it
deserves
to
me
the
rochefort
10
is
the
gold
standard
by
which
all
beers
are
measured
yet
none
can
live
up
to
drink
in
good
health
friends
prost
o
this
beer
has
to
be
the
best
widely
available
trappist
quad
out
there
it
is
simply
amazing
every
time
i
come
back
to
it
i
have
to
admit
this
is
probably
the
most
winelike
beer
i
have
ever
had
the
alcohol
astringency
in
the
finish
is
probably
the
biggest
deterrent
for
me
other
than
that
this
is
probably
one
of
the
most
complex
beers
around
and
is
worth
trying
at
least
once
i
personally
found
the
rochefort
8
a
little
more
drinker
friendly
check
em
both
out
if
you
can
recommended
if
this
is
not
the
perfect
beer
it
is
quite
close
typical
quad
brown
lighter
around
the
edges
with
light
lacing
head
nose
is
dominated
by
roasted
caramel
chocolate
and
loads
of
yeasty
fruitiness
sweet
taste
with
milky
chocolate
and
slight
nuttiness
over
that
glorious
caramel
warming
alcohol
is
evident
but
adds
to
balance
if
not
for
the
inherent
weight
of
the
beer
i
could
drink
this
thing
all
night
my
favorite
beer
a
good
possibility
if
you
can
find
it
buy
it
and
set
it
aside
for
a
special
occasion
clean
and
sharp
carbonation
with
a
medium
body
d
is
good
but
there
is
a
boozy
presence
that
takes
away
from
it
the
drink
is
as
easy
as
any
brew
of
this
magnitude
very
nice
well
played
sirs
one
of
my
alltime
favorites
d
i
could
drink
a
few
of
these
the
alcohol
is
hidden
so
very
well
a
real
pleasure
to
taste
however
i
prefer
the
st
bernardus
abt
12
to
this
one
it
just
seems
a
bit
more
chewy
with
more
of
a
dark
fruit
and
spice
that
i
prefer
overall
this
is
still
a
world
class
quad
d
easy
to
drink
but
probably
just
once
in
a
while
for
me
i
prefer
the
westy
12
to
this
one
although
this
is
a
good
quad
d
this
one
is
a
sipper
for
sure
the
abv
and
huge
flavor
punch
make
sure
that
it
is
a
brew
that
goes
down
slowly
incredibly
drinkable
the
dark
fruit
really
smooths
out
the
11
3
great
drinker
overall
this
beer
is
great
i
would
drink
it
any
day
edit
just
tried
this
again
in
better
circumstances
and
sipping
it
slowly
i
find
it
amazing
how
smooth
it
goes
down
and
how
well
the
booze
is
hidden
definitely
the
most
drinkable
quad
ive
come
across
so
far
drinkability
drinkability
is
great
but
you
dont
want
to
session
drink
this
due
to
the
high
alcohol
i
finally
got
around
to
tasting
this
quad
masterpiece
poured
into
my
duvel
tulip
with
a
3
finger
head
that
lingers
awhile
smell
is
great
with
dark
fruits
and
sweet
malts
dominating
taste
is
so
very
complex
and
wonderous
raisins
plums
figs
and
spices
are
everywhere
in
a
good
way
mouthfeel
is
similair
to
abt
12
in
this
category
drinkability
is
much
better
than
expected
from
such
a
high
abv
beer
you
could
definitely
have
more
than
one
of
these
in
a
session
all
in
all
this
was
a
damn
good
quadrupel
and
im
thrilled
to
have
tried
this
this
is
the
real
deal
what
a
beer
all
in
all
this
is
a
delicious
beera
spectacular
belgian
quad
that
ill
continue
to
purchase
for
years
to
come
if
you
havent
tried
it
do
md
full
body
but
not
very
heavy
carbonation
is
too
high
for
my
taste
too
prickly
and
contributes
to
a
bit
of
falling
apart
on
the
tongue
drinkability
is
a
little
low
for
me
its
just
such
a
big
beer
despite
the
huge
booze
presence
i
can
still
appreciate
this
beer
the
sample
i
had
while
in
belgium
was
much
less
bold
then
this
sample
overall
this
one
definitely
lives
up
to
the
hype
and
then
some
it
puts
its
little
brothers
the
roch
6
and
roch
8
to
shame
as
part
of
the
quad
showdown
this
was
my
favourite
of
the
three
by
far
a
thing
of
beauty
in
the
glass
and
a
real
tasty
treat
the
rochefort
10
is
a
real
pleasure
probably
the
most
drinkable
quad
as
well
though
one
at
a
time
is
enough
this
one
will
become
a
staple
in
the
beer
cellar
overall
a
great
beer
tough
to
go
wrong
with
a
trappist
though
ive
had
this
many
times
in
the
past
and
enjoyed
it
much
more
than
today
i
will
have
to
reevaluate
this
world
class
beer
in
the
future
and
see
if
i
rate
it
higher
wow
this
stuff
is
good
huge
head
on
every
pour
having
to
wait
for
it
to
die
down
before
i
can
sip
laces
the
glass
thickly
and
fully
murky
brown
color
taste
is
very
creamy
smooth
well
balanced
tasty
malt
smooth
mouthfeel
as
well
i
could
easily
drink
too
many
of
these
exceptional
brew
this
is
by
far
a
favourite
more
so
than
the
famed
st
bernie
12
that
is
so
beloved
to
my
heart
and
to
so
many
others
as
well
a
polite
bow
to
the
devoted
monks
at
abbaye
st
remy
drinkability
is
amazing
this
brew
makes
you
want
to
come
back
for
more
but
will
knock
you
flat
if
you
drink
too
many
too
fast
overall
a
world
class
beer
been
a
long
time
since
ive
had
sister
beer
westvleteren
12
but
from
memory
this
stacks
up
quite
well
against
it
i
have
a
few
bottles
of
westy
in
the
fridge
and
will
review
soon
im
curious
to
compare
the
reviews
daverage
drinkability
though
i
would
rank
it
higher
for
the
style
this
beer
has
a
lot
of
good
aspects
of
both
strong
ales
and
stouts
its
certainly
one
you
have
to
drink
every
once
in
a
while
1
or
2
bottles
is
enough
for
sure
one
great
trappist
quad
howver
only
slight
bettered
by
the
rochefort
8
which
i
consider
to
be
slightly
more
rewarding
however
only
just
and
this
is
just
my
opinion
still
not
100
sure
which
i
like
betterthe
8
or
the
10i
think
the
mouthfeel
here
puts
the
10
over
the
top
although
i
think
i
like
the
style
of
the
8
better
d
very
sessionable
if
expensive
brew
my
favorite
trappist
ale
yet
d
considering
this
belgian
ale
is
11
3
abv
i
would
probably
not
venture
into
having
a
second
then
again
i
respect
this
beer
too
much
to
have
more
than
one
per
sitting
it
is
a
great
trappist
brew
and
would
recommend
it
to
any
beer
connossieur
33cl
bottle
from
systembolaget
old
school
lund
status
ok
here
we
go
then
very
dark
brown
with
a
small
tan
head
that
leaves
lacing
til
the
end
the
aroma
itself
is
intoxicating
sweetness
vanilla
hazelnut
caramel
some
butterscotch
and
a
little
alcohol
the
flavor
is
very
sweet
and
alcoholic
a
bit
straightforward
in
this
respect
a
lot
of
caramelized
sugar
flavor
and
ripe
fruitiness
the
body
is
very
thick
and
full
but
the
alcohol
keeps
it
from
being
too
sticky
in
your
tongue
and
the
coarbonation
is
ample
but
very
soft
at
the
same
time
this
is
quite
a
beer
but
i
still
like
rochefort
8
more
simply
because
its
levels
of
alcohol
and
thickness
make
it
a
more
pleasant
experience
10
is
simply
a
massive
beer
youve
got
to
be
ready
for
it
for
sure
or
itll
kick
your
ass
d
drinkability
this
one
kind
of
kicked
my
butt
but
it
was
well
worth
and
if
i
had
a
second
bottle
of
it
it
would
have
likely
been
drank
in
the
same
sitting
abv
is
pretty
big
so
its
probably
better
in
moderation
but
this
is
easily
one
of
the
best
balanced
and
tasty
beers
ive
come
across
yet
another
classic
from
rochefort
a
very
complex
beer
that
mandates
sipping
slowly
i
like
this
far
more
than
either
the
6
or
8
very
complex
rich
and
tasty
the
bold
spiciness
surprised
me
but
the
rich
malts
and
dark
fruits
balanced
it
out
nicely
great
stuff
overall
a
great
belgium
quad
one
ill
deffinatly
be
getting
more
of
330
ml
pour
into
chalice
moderate
yeasty
offwhite
head
very
deep
dark
brown
pour
definite
aroma
of
dark
caramel
ripe
banana
peel
malt
caramel
and
alcohol
on
the
nose
wow
the
alcohol
hits
you
at
the
very
end
of
the
sip
smooth
beer
very
flavorful
drinking
this
around
60
degrees
i
think
im
having
a
religious
experience
here
the
flavor
of
this
heavenly
brew
is
simply
outstanding
all
i
know
is
i
have
come
a
very
long
way
from
the
macro
brews
i
consumed
68
months
ago
cheers
and
god
bless
the
trappist
monks
d
it
warms
you
as
you
drink
in
a
marvelous
way
a
bit
like
good
scotch
rochefort
really
makes
a
fine
quad
my
first
quad
d
its
a
sipper
but
well
worth
the
time
it
takes
to
knock
one
back
take
your
time
and
try
to
figure
out
all
that
is
going
on
in
this
d
smooth
hard
to
take
in
all
this
beer
has
to
offer
with
a
single
tasting
will
definitely
have
to
pick
up
another
one
of
these
overall
paired
it
with
some
dry
wild
boar
sausage
turning
out
to
be
a
very
good
combination
i
did
enjoy
this
one
but
i
must
try
the
other
quads
out
there
before
i
decide
on
whats
my
favorite
give
it
a
try
if
youve
never
had
it
drinkability
very
in
your
face
up
front
but
mellows
out
as
it
goes
along
not
a
session
beer
because
of
the
high
alcohol
but
would
definitely
drink
again
4
0
d
this
is
probably
a
little
overrated
but
good
nonetheless
drinkability
this
is
one
of
the
best
beers
ive
ever
had
i
really
wish
i
had
purchased
more
than
one
bottle
because
i
could
really
go
for
some
more
right
now
next
time
im
drinking
it
warm
the
flavor
profile
really
picked
up
right
at
the
end
dsecond
only
to
westy
12
and
not
by
much
in
my
book
a
quality
and
very
complex
brew
that
begs
to
be
discovered
the
flavours
duck
and
hide
and
then
peek
out
to
offer
themselves
up
for
the
imbiber
a
most
impressive
offering
from
the
abbaye
stremy
monks
very
good
but
not
mindblowing
like
i
had
hoped
it
would
be
i
really
liked
this
beer
more
than
i
thought
i
would
its
sweet
but
not
sickenlingly
sweet
and
the
alcohol
is
present
but
not
overpowering
id
be
happy
to
drink
this
anytime
but
not
so
happy
to
pay
for
it
d
tasty
goes
down
dangerously
easily
not
too
filling
very
strong
kick
very
good
representation
of
style
i
can
appreciate
the
beers
complexity
craftsmanship
and
while
its
a
really
good
strong
belgian
beer
to
drink
for
a
whole
night
ive
had
other
quads
that
i
would
pick
first
edit
adding
to
my
review
i
had
another
of
these
last
night
on
5409
i
let
the
rochefort
10
rest
tonight
at
room
temp
for
about
20
minutes
before
digging
into
it
the
carbonation
seemed
less
today
and
not
in
a
good
way
its
mouthfeel
was
also
a
little
thicker
than
id
like
it
seemed
to
be
sweet
without
carbonation
and
spices
to
back
it
up
and
had
a
really
unique
taste
not
adjusting
my
numerical
scores
today
but
st
bernardus
abt
12
is
still
king
for
me
compared
to
this
one
i
would
probably
drink
this
all
the
time
if
i
had
the
money
to
buy
it
its
definitely
a
sipper
something
to
be
enjoyed
on
a
cold
night
after
a
long
days
work
really
good
notes
this
is
one
very
dark
rich
complex
and
strong
ale
i
didnt
pair
my
sample
with
anything
because
i
didnt
want
to
distract
my
palate
with
anything
other
than
the
taste
of
this
highlytouted
beer
but
next
time
i
might
drink
this
alongside
a
nice
cut
of
beer
or
a
strong
cheese
hopefully
ill
get
to
do
this
sooner
rather
than
later
but
at
7
50
a
bottle
it
might
be
a
while
before
i
pick
up
another
one
of
these
beers
no
matter
how
delicious
it
is
regardless
if
this
is
a
beer
that
you
have
not
tried
yet
do
yourself
a
favor
and
pick
up
a
bottle
next
time
youre
at
the
store
you
wont
regret
it
smooth
mouth
feel
a
little
boozy
but
considering
the
abv
its
very
well
hidden
no
problem
drinking
one
but
putting
two
back
would
be
a
bit
of
a
struggle
definitely
recommend
it
but
if
you
know
you
dont
like
cloves
you
may
want
to
think
twice
about
forking
over
the
cash
this
beer
is
a
nice
dark
maroon
color
with
a
great
head
not
sure
the
inches
bc
the
smell
kept
my
nose
in
it
for
awhile
it
was
served
at
a
perfect
50
degrees
as
fair
as
smell
there
is
no
trappiste
ale
ive
had
have
had
most
all
of
this
type
with
such
a
great
smell
cant
even
describe
it
just
such
a
wonderful
smell
taste
even
better
than
the
smell
or
just
as
good
to
me
trappiste
ales
are
hard
to
describe
tastesmell
wise
all
i
can
say
is
most
are
very
smooth
with
a
high
abv
you
can
even
taste
especially
this
one
mouthfeel
not
think
at
all
very
smooth
overall
way
too
easy
to
drink
considering
the
abv
in
this
beer
this
is
one
of
the
best
beers
i
will
ever
have
in
my
life
drinkability
a
definite
beer
one
that
should
be
tried
in
short
this
lives
up
to
the
hype
best
trappist
ive
ever
had
period
my
experience
with
beeradvocate
com
is
literally
shaping
who
i
am
as
a
human
being
i
cant
wait
for
the
next
100
and
i
cant
think
of
a
better
beer
to
celebrate
my
centennial
10
is
one
of
those
that
i
have
always
wondered
about
and
now
will
always
think
of
longingly
what
an
excellent
beer
thank
god
for
the
catholic
church
and
for
putting
men
in
monasteries
for
so
long
that
they
literally
had
no
choice
but
to
create
some
of
the
finest
beers
on
the
planet
to
pass
the
time
this
is
a
beautiful
beer
that
should
be
savored
nicely
comparable
to
the
pannepot
grand
reserva
but
with
a
richer
history
and
nicer
aftertaste
must
say
i
am
impressed
while
westvleteren
really
is
the
creme
de
la
creme
in
the
quad
class
one
can
see
why
this
is
the
runner
up
drinkablility
this
brew
give
a
fantastic
performance
it
just
grabs
your
palate
and
tells
you
who
is
in
controll
it
linger
on
stage
to
long
prehaps
by
it
knows
what
its
doing
notes
beautiful
truely
amazing
im
a
huge
belgian
fan
and
this
one
just
ousted
st
bernardous
out
of
my
number
one
i
saved
this
for
a
special
occasion
and
it
did
not
let
me
down
at
all
d
this
is
a
sit
by
the
fire
and
contemplate
life
while
you
sip
slowly
away
type
beer
very
interesting
and
subtle
in
its
presentation
overall
go
now
and
have
one
a
truly
great
beer
i
was
lucky
enough
to
be
gifted
with
two
cases
of
this
beer
which
i
have
been
slowly
drinking
over
the
last
year
when
this
supply
runs
out
i
may
actually
cry
into
my
last
beer
and
then
proceed
to
go
out
and
buy
another
stash
m
pretty
good
not
thin
not
ultra
thick
it
is
drinkable
i
like
it
a
lot
d
spot
on
for
a
huge
quad
this
is
certainly
one
of
the
best
beers
of
its
style
i
really
liked
how
it
wasnt
too
over
the
top
with
the
dark
fruit
taste
or
alcohol
everything
meshed
together
very
well
to
create
a
wonderful
beer
to
sip
and
admire
d
nice
brew
that
should
be
sipped
and
savored
by
the
time
you
finish
it
you
have
drunk
the
equivalent
of
half
a
bottle
750ml
of
a
retsina
wine
would
you
have
another
one
thankfully
the
rochefort
10
is
much
more
accessible
than
its
cousin
the
westvleteren
so
you
can
have
another
one
albeit
the
price
note
ill
be
trying
this
beer
again
in
a
few
weeks
and
will
try
to
improve
on
this
description
this
is
a
fine
beer
but
lacks
the
depth
to
be
the
top
of
its
class
i
love
the
availability
always
a
pleasure
to
drink
overall
its
so
nice
to
have
such
a
great
beer
available
all
the
time
if
you
havent
tried
this
one
yet
do
so
i
didnt
fully
appreciate
belgian
quads
when
i
first
encountered
them
granted
i
thought
i
could
even
despite
not
really
liking
the
way
they
tasted
but
over
the
years
ive
come
to
recognize
their
subtleties
acknowledge
their
distinctiveness
be
cognizant
of
their
disposition
and
have
developed
a
better
understanding
of
just
how
they
not
only
symbolize
but
quite
literally
are
the
result
of
generation
upon
generation
of
skilled
and
devoted
monks
wow
another
good
trappist
quad
everyone
should
try
drinkability
is
good
but
not
great
the
level
of
carbonation
and
alcohol
in
the
finish
might
turn
a
few
people
off
d
starts
out
moderately
drinkable
but
ends
as
one
of
the
more
drinkable
beers
on
the
market
dgreat
beer
no
doubt
i
use
this
beer
as
a
treat
to
myself
this
is
a
great
great
beer
i
only
wish
i
could
get
a
westy
12
now
to
pair
it
against
that
monster
no
doubt
in
my
mind
this
is
one
of
the
best
beers
i
have
ever
had
d
surprising
drinkable
for
a
quad
of
such
high
alcohol
although
a
beer
your
want
to
drink
slowly
and
savor
it
would
not
be
a
chore
to
have
more
than
one
overall
good
quad
but
i
dont
feel
it
lived
up
to
the
hype
the
mouthfeel
is
great
its
nice
and
creamy
with
just
the
right
amount
of
carbonation
drinkability
is
pretty
good
considering
the
style
and
alcohol
content
as
i
said
very
good
quad
but
i
feel
that
for
the
price
id
go
with
st
bernardus
12
over
this
d
absolutely
aweinspiring
in
fact
its
kind
of
humbling
to
know
that
the
art
of
brewing
can
be
taken
to
such
heights
to
paraphrase
samuel
johnson
when
a
man
is
tired
of
rochefort
he
is
tired
of
life
of
course
if
you
possess
enough
wealth
and
leisure
time
to
drink
rochefort
to
the
point
of
tedium
ill
hardly
be
shedding
any
tears
on
your
behalf
by
far
the
smoothest
beer
i
have
ever
had
creamy
and
full
bodied
the
sweetness
would
make
it
difficult
to
have
more
than
one
bottle
but
at
11
3
you
dont
need
much
more
poured
into
a
chalice
dark
purplish
brown
with
a
large
fizzy
tan
head
very
sweet
smell
of
plums
grapes
licorice
and
pepper
similar
flavors
in
the
taste
definitely
some
sugar
grapes
dates
and
pepper
a
strong
dry
and
bitter
alcoholic
finish
mouthfeel
is
very
fizzy
and
carbonated
very
smooth
and
drinkable
while
this
is
still
amazing
i
had
it
before
while
in
belgium
and
remember
it
being
even
better
d
quite
good
even
with
the
additional
alcohol
feel
i
think
this
is
more
drinkable
than
the
rochefort
8
d
a
sipper
for
sure
but
a
remarkably
balanced
beer
thats
easy
to
drink
d
very
drinkable
while
not
being
overly
sweet
like
some
in
the
style
this
is
well
balanced
with
a
warming
quality
on
the
way
down
11
3
is
quite
high
but
what
the
hell
i
would
drink
a
few
you
only
live
once
right
a
great
quad
at
a
fair
price
with
good
availability
what
more
can
you
ask
for
the
first
thing
to
hit
the
tongue
is
the
strong
carbonation
the
flavors
and
complexity
are
so
simple
yet
so
brilliant
i
taste
earthy
and
dusty
flavors
up
front
like
mold
or
mushrooms
then
later
wood
vanillaoak
and
toasty
smokey
raisins
burnt
malt
flavors
it
finishes
dry
and
crisp
with
a
butterscotch
sweetness
in
between
great
drinkability
alcohol
is
almost
unnoticeable
and
the
rich
carbonation
makes
it
a
pure
pleasure
and
a
light
drinker
for
such
a
strong
well
defined
quad
drinkability
very
drinkable
for
such
a
strong
beer
though
one
bottle
was
plenty
d
its
a
fantastic
beer
no
doubt
i
use
this
beer
as
a
treat
to
myself
very
drinkable
beer
i
dont
find
the
alcohol
too
overwhelming
by
any
means
kind
of
expensive
for
11
2
ounces
but
that
is
expected
i
guess
for
a
beer
of
this
prestige
overall
this
being
number
12
overall
i
was
a
little
disappointed
it
is
an
amazing
beer
but
i
have
had
better
i
really
enjoyed
the
smell
the
alcohol
was
a
little
overwhelmng
i
do
recommend
though
d
this
beer
is
definitely
a
sipper
but
i
could
sip
this
all
day
long
if
it
wasnt
for
the
price
one
of
the
best
beers
in
the
world
period
this
is
a
huge
delectable
beer
and
i
could
make
a
habit
out
of
drinking
this
except
the
price
and
the
alcohol
limits
my
consumption
but
if
your
goal
were
to
be
driven
insane
and
poor
by
beer
consumption
id
choose
this
as
the
way
to
go
a
rochefort
8
would
also
do
but
the
10
will
get
you
there
quicker
overall
this
is
a
complex
and
magnificent
beer
great
aroma
and
flavor
if
you
are
into
quads
this
is
a
beer
you
must
try
d
if
i
paced
myself
i
could
drink
this
all
night
the
combination
of
subtle
fruits
and
no
ego
makes
this
one
a
must
have
on
hand
d
im
really
glad
i
finally
had
this
beer
it
was
a
very
nice
experience
that
i
hope
to
have
again
poured
into
a
rochefort
glass
dark
brown
in
color
with
a
nice
tan
head
smells
of
molasses
and
dr
pepper
this
sipper
is
heaven
on
earth
could
drink
these
all
night
if
it
werent
for
the
high
abv
the
carbonation
is
perfect
this
is
a
must
try
and
one
of
my
all
time
favorites
memorable
quality
this
beer
is
all
over
the
place
depending
on
age
bottles
aged
a
year
or
so
have
been
some
of
the
most
dynamic
quads
i
have
ever
had
younger
bottles
produce
an
everlasting
white
head
that
is
like
nothing
else
ive
seen
regardless
the
sticky
depth
of
dark
fruits
and
other
worldly
yeast
make
this
an
all
time
great
beer
i
have
one
more
bottle
in
the
cellar
and
i
think
that
will
sit
for
ten
years
plus
just
to
mellow
out
the
alcohol
and
give
the
sugars
a
chance
to
degrade
a
bit
my
goodness
its
like
eating
pure
sugar
cane
d
very
good
tasting
beer
still
have
the
68
sitting
in
the
basement
but
chose
the
goliath
of
these
trappist
beers
high
abv
would
keep
me
from
drinking
too
many
great
sippin
belgian
way
to
go
monks
im
getting
lots
of
wood
vanilla
bourbon
lots
of
warmth
in
the
aftertaste
this
is
a
sipper
this
is
something
that
can
be
used
to
keep
warm
in
these
cold
minnesota
winters
this
is
one
awesome
beer
and
well
worth
the
6
price
tag
i
want
more
every
bit
as
good
as
the
uberhyped
westvleteren
but
very
different
overall
i
am
very
impressed
by
this
beer
i
am
not
a
huge
belgian
ale
fan
but
this
is
very
good
i
will
definitely
have
this
again
and
likely
turn
a
few
of
my
friends
onto
it
a
very
interesting
beer
this
beer
hides
its
alcohol
level
masterfully
and
is
something
that
my
friends
and
i
are
able
to
continue
drinking
and
relaxing
with
on
a
long
night
drink
the
high
abv
and
sharp
carbonation
makes
this
a
very
slow
drink
one
12oz
bottle
is
quite
enough
d
a
very
good
flavor
but
the
alcohol
smell
and
taste
are
an
absolute
dealbreaker
there
are
similarly
complex
brews
that
do
a
better
job
of
masking
the
burn
i
will
try
the
rochefort
8
but
i
have
no
intention
of
purchasing
the
10
again
a
very
undrinkable
brew
drinkablity
very
high
you
dont
need
to
drink
a
lot
of
these
to
know
what
i
mean
almost
no
hint
of
the
alcohol
in
this
one
even
at
11
id
have
no
problem
drinking
several
bottles
of
this
masterful
notes
trappistes
rochefort
10
is
a
great
beer
its
a
sweet
and
spicy
rich
and
complex
wellmade
quad
that
delivers
quite
the
headslap
to
those
who
imbibe
excellent
highly
recommended
d
this
is
an
excellent
beer
that
is
extremely
well
balanced
it
bursts
with
fruity
flavor
and
washes
down
with
its
strong
abv
if
it
were
any
stronger
it
would
be
overwhelming
but
it
is
just
about
perfect
in
my
opinion
does
not
dissapoint
revisited

drinkability
is
nice
for
a
sipper
d
for
sipping
purposes
only
this
quad
hits
the
marks
not
quite
as
good
as
westy
12
but
this
one
is
glorified
in
its
own
unique
flavor
a
bit
more
dark
fruit
endowed
and
a
bit
more
smooth
this
is
one
very
very
fine
beer
drinkability
easy
to
get
lost
in
considering
its
11
still
not
perfect
but
its
very
smooth
and
palatable
d
if
you
wanted
a
reminder
that
beer
is
indeed
and
alcoholic
beverage
this
brew
will
call
that
to
mind
albeit
it
does
so
with
plenty
of
complex
and
crafted
flavors
however
if
youre
drinking
a
quad
you
know
what
youre
getting
into
should
expect
and
enjoy
it
so
its
expected
and
enjoyably
drinkable
slow
sippin
d
an
excellent
sipper
here
a
fine
dark
grape
sweetness
makes
it
an
easy
drinker
but
be
careful
a
well
hidden
11
3
lies
underneath
i
poured
from
a
11
2
ounce
bottle
into
my
sa
pint
glass
it
pours
a
deep
caramel
with
a
pretty
white
head
and
lots
of
lacing
the
aroma
is
laced
with
sweet
fruit
an
alcohol
the
flavor
hints
at
dates
and
alcohol
with
a
finish
that
lingers
it
is
a
full
bodied
with
a
wonderful
creamy
mouthfeel
that
you
sip
over
the
course
of
an
hour
mfd
exceptionally
smooth
and
easy
to
drink
the
feel
is
perfect
not
too
thick
or
thin
just
right
and
allows
all
the
nuances
of
flavours
to
come
out
the
bluntness
of
the
alcohol
is
the
only
thing
that
impedes
the
drinking
process
this
beer
is
fantastic
i
will
happily
splurge
on
this
beer
many
more
times
although
i
do
prefer
the
trappistes
rochefort
8
this
beer
pours
an
incredibly
dark
and
cloudy
brown
with
a
1
fingered
light
tan
head
and
some
lacing
the
smell
is
of
raisins
and
molasses
the
flavor
is
big
there
is
no
shortage
of
malt
in
this
beer
and
certainly
alot
of
dark
malts
certainly
the
darkest
quad
i
have
ever
tried
there
are
big
hints
of
raisins
and
plums
int
he
flavor
backed
with
an
enormous
malt
base
also
this
beer
is
quite
sweet
the
mouthfeel
is
decent
with
a
rather
low
carbonation
level
and
for
an
11
3
abv
beer
this
beer
is
highly
drinkable
poured
to
a
dark
brown
cloudy
color
with
a
perfect
sized
fit
the
glass
perfectly
medium
tan
head
that
has
good
legs
leaving
sheets
of
lace
down
the
side
of
the
chalice
this
is
a
very
good
looking
brew
the
aroma
has
a
warming
alcohol
smell
rum
or
brandy
dark
sugar
could
be
adding
to
why
i
feel
it
has
rum
like
characteristics
different
fruit
apple
andor
pear
and
cherries
what
a
fantastic
and
inviting
mixture
of
aromas
the
taste
is
simply
fantastic
again
going
with
the
rum
aspect
i
pick
up
rum
cake
has
a
wood
like
flavor
that
seems
to
linger
for
a
bit
then
disappears
the
fruit
does
come
out
but
not
as
the
applepear
i
noticed
when
i
was
first
taking
a
whiff
with
fig
date
prune
flavors
medium
spice
flavors
that
mix
oh
so
well
i
know
that
a
lot
of
folks
say
that
they
get
banana
when
they
drink
this
one
not
for
me
as
i
cant
pick
up
that
flavor
one
bit
the
feel
of
this
one
does
not
come
close
to
the
11
3
alcohol
level
as
it
is
very
smooth
and
well
hidden
behind
all
of
the
interlaced
flavors
though
as
this
brew
warms
the
alcohol
esters
do
seem
to
come
out
a
little
more
but
in
a
way
that
is
a
complete
complement
to
this
brew
very
easy
brew
to
drink
even
though
it
should
be
a
sipper
but
it
is
damn
good
and
goes
down
quickly
give
this
brew
a
try
as
it
is
simply
a
delight
d
a
great
sipping
beer
for
a
special
occasion
pours
a
slightly
cloudy
dark
brown
with
faint
ruby
highlights
and
a
smallish
off
white
head
that
dissipates
to
a
cap
smells
of
dark
fruit
burnt
sugar
a
bit
of
alcohol
taste
is
fruity
with
a
smokey
funky
taste
some
phenolic
and
bubblegum
in
there
as
well
the
carbonation
is
a
bit
high
body
is
thick
mouthfeel
is
bubblycreamy
i
loved
the
smell
and
taste
of
this
one
but
i
thought
the
high
carbonation
did
unfavorable
things
to
the
mouthfeel
d
this
is
very
tasty
and
smooth
be
careful
the
11
3
abv
will
sneak
up
on
you
enjoyed
in
brugge
at
my
favorite
pub
there
pours
a
murky
light
black
with
a
nice
relatively
full
creamy
head
the
complexity
of
the
dried
fruit
and
bready
flavors
are
very
nice
but
what
makes
this
so
special
is
how
perfectly
balanced
and
how
nice
the
mouthfeel
is
probably
the
most
drinkable
beer
i
have
ever
encountered
a
true
masterpiece
and
certainly
among
the
elite
trappist
products
d
highly
drinkable
one
of
my
favorite
quads
save
urthel
overall
not
my
favorite
style
of
belgian
beer
i
think
ill
have
to
keep
trying
with
this
style
theres
too
much
going
on
for
my
likings
but
that
being
said
the
taste
gets
better
the
longer
its
open
and
while
its
warming
up
but
on
the
final
few
swigs
the
alcohol
became
too
overwhelming
and
felt
dry
an
ok
beer
im
not
huge
on
belgian
quads
so
that
might
be
my
issue
with
this
it
might
be
that
im
uninspired
but
either
way
not
really
a
huge
fan
of
this
i
need
to
go
to
belgium
now
d
woah
drink
a
few
other
belgians
for
a
while
before
having
this
holy
grail
otherwise
enjoy
cause
this
ones
heavenly
drinkability
like
i
said
before
love
this
beer
and
i
find
that
two
in
a
single
sitting
is
all
you
need
it
seems
only
to
get
better
with
age
cant
wait
to
see
what
another
year
does
this
is
a
standout
brew
to
drink
and
very
good
for
style
medium
creamy
tan
head
deep
bromnishreddish
colour
there
is
precipitation
in
the
liquid
guess
that
it
is
due
to
the
fermentation
aroma
of
dark
fruit
alcohol
and
spices
aroma
is
less
sweet
than
many
other
beers
in
the
same
category
even
though
it
is
clearly
present
in
this
one
too
taste
is
really
nice
dark
fruit
alcohol
spices
and
orange
mouthfeel
is
lively
but
not
as
lively
as
the
rochefort
8
this
is
good
cause
i
think
rochefort
8
isnt
very
good
this
is
by
far
the
best
belgian
beer
ive
tried
pours
a
dark
brownblack
color
strong
aroma
of
citrus
plum
dark
fruit
very
sugary
very
complex

some
alcohol
upon
pouring
this
brew
has
a
dark
mahogany
color
with
a
wonderful
thick

head
the
aroma
is
at
first
hard
to
detect
through
the
head
but
eventually
hints
of
rasin
spice
and
candied
sugar
show
the
hop
aroma
is
slight
yet
still
present
all
i
could
say
upon
tasting
was
holy
st
this
brew
has
everything
a
worldclass
beer
is
expected
to
have
sweet
and
malty
at
first
with
fig
rasin
brown
sugar
dried
fruit
and
much
more
it
finishes
sweet
as
well
but
with
a
very
nice
zesty
hop
touch
this
beer
is
one
of
if
not
the
best
i
have
ever
tasted
even
for
its
high
abv
it
is
very
smooth
and
delicate
its
velvety
mouthfeel
is
to
die
for
its
one
of
the
most
quaffable
brews
i
have
ever
tasted
rochefort
10
is
definitely
one
to
stock
up
on
buy
as
many
of
these
as
you
can
and
drink
them
fresh
or
age
them
for
a
few
years
drinkability
sip
and
savor
this
amazing
brew
d
as
with
just
about
all
the
belgian
beers
i
have
had
the
sweetness
builds
substantially
and
is
the
only
hindering
factor
an
exceptional
quad
duh
this
was
a
new
bottle
i
have
enjoyed
aged
versions
even
more
in
the
past
my
one
want
from
this
beer
would
be
a
slightly
bolder
malt
flavor
but
who
am
i
to
complain
notes
yum
d
overall
a
full
bodied
robust
beer
with
a
sweet
malty
character
and
roasted
notes
that
drinks
like
a
dream
upon
tasting
i
was
correct
this
beer
is
amazing
perfect
balance
between
the
main
components
malty
up
front
with
just
the
right
amount
of
hop
kick
to
keep
it
in
check
to
follow
sweetness
is
typical
belgian
but
far
from
overpowering
i
think
the
carbonation
gives
it
a
sizzle
that
acts
as
counterpoint
hint
of
a
grassy
flavor
but
nothing
like
a
barnyard
buried
deeper
in
the
flavor
profile
are
dark
fruits
plum
raisin
date
and
what
to
me
tastes
like
licorice
or
something
similar
mouthfeel
is
just
thick
and
coating
but
in
a
completely
awesome
way
because
of
the
high
carbonation
keeps
things
moving
its
like
drinking
velvet
the
consistency
is
just
so
easygoing
that
makes
for
an
amazing
oral
sensation
as
well
as
drinkability
theres
a
little
boozy
presence
on
the
finish
but
it
settles
right
in
not
too
hot
or
anything
i
could
drink
this
forever
i
want
to
give
5s
all
around
i
really
do
im
severely
tempted
but
i
think
its
just
a
little
too
much
of
a
sipper
to
earn
perfect
marks
for
drinkability
and
mouthfeel
not
quite
perfection
but
this
is
pretty
damn
close
to
it
while
im
still
pretty
early
in
my
beer
drinking
life
this
may
be
the
best
ive
had
so
far
now
i
want
to
cellar
one
and
see
how
much
closer
to
5s
across
i
can
get
update

aroma
of
dark
fruits
apple
pear
and
raisins
flavor
of
sweet
fruits
especially
apple
quite
boozy
in
the
finish
i
do
enjoy
this
beer
but
i
think
i
rated
it
especially
high
because
it
was
the
first
good
beer
i
really
loved
always
a
pleasure
though
i
think
the
8
is
better
however
this
beer
can
certainly
vary
from
bottle
to
bottle
unfortunately
i
have
to
lower

you
can
see
why
this
is
a
sought
after
belgian
glad
i
purchased
several
bottles
im
interested
to
see
what
happens
with
some
age
on
this
a
wonderful
treat
to
have
in
china
of
the
big
3
westy
st
bernardus
and
rochefort
this
is
my
favorite
the
flavors
are
hugely
complex
but
dont
beat
me
over
the
head
it
can
be
an
easy
enjoyable
sipper
or
a
beer
to
be
dissected
and
contemplated
whichever
you
prefer
this
is
the
quad
to
buy
it
poured
out
with
a
giant
head
it
might
have
been
because
i
had
some
difficulty
in
opening
the
bottle
which
made
it
bubble
up
so
i
had
to
pour
a
bit
quicker
than
i
would
have
but
its
a
dark
brown
with
a
few
ruby
red
hues
the
head
is
offwhite
and
it
lasted
the
entire
time
i
could
even
see
bits
of
bubbles
and
sediment
waiting
around
in
the
beer
the
smell
is
yeast
and
a
bit
of
alcoholic
sweetness
the
taste
is
nearly
perfect
i
love
the
way
all
of
the
sweetness
is
perfectly
balanced
with
the
darkness
and
even
the
good
sweetness
from
the
darker
roasted
malts
is
extracted
if
the
alcohol
content
was
just
a
little
bit
more
subdued
namely
if
the
bit
of
burnt
alchohol
taste
was
not
present
i
couldve
found
a
perfect
5
in
this
but
i
really
love
it
the
mouthfeel
has
adequate
carbonation
a
good
amount
of
complexity
from
the
darkeness
and
sweetness
and
it
drinks
very
well
for
the
style
i
could
drink
these
until
it
caught
up
with
me
and
knocked
me
on
my
ass
i
will
probably
buy
another
at
some
point
in
the
future
yep
this
is
an
exceptional
brew
very
rich
in
color
and
body
with
a
truetostyle
florality
and
sweetness
smells
of
carmel
yeast
and
floral
the
taste
is
sweet
bready
sweet
maltiness
and
prevelant
alcohol
the
mouthfeel
is
rich
and
creamy
with
outstanding
carbonation
a
wonderful

overall
this
is
a
very
tasty
beer
but
i
think
i
give
the
edge
to
the
8
the
10
is
very
bold
and
the
flavors
all
work
together
very
well
but
i
think
the
8
has
just
a
tad
more
balance
and
is
more
drinkable
that
being
said
both
of
these
should
be
tried
by
everyone
are
my
expectations
raised
after
reading
how
ba
mag
rated
this
the
best
beer
of
all
time
yes
the
fact
that
this
is
made
by
monks
in
a
tradition
that
is
centuries
old
does
not
improve
the
appearance
smell
taste
or
mouthfeel
but
it
does
improve
the
drinkability
from
a
historical
perspective
nicely
drinkable
this
beer
goes
down
smooth
although
it
has
a
higher
alcohol
content
which
would
make
it
a
poor
session
beer
this
is
much
more
of
a
nightcap
d
not
a
highly
drinkable
beer
at
11
30
but
pretty
decent
for
a
quad
this
one
never
lets
me
down
even
after
all
these
years
first
had
this
in
2003
pours
a
deep
brown
with
a
thin
tan
head
aroma
is
fruity
sweet
with
currant
and
caramel
flavor
is
very
fruity
and
roasty
to
a
lesser
extent
alcohol
is
noticeable
particularly
going
down
but
not
nearly
as
much
as
the
abv
would
suggest
medium
to
heavy
bodied
chewy
texture
this
is
real
beer
the
way
it
is
supposed
to
be
made
strong
pruney
raisin
smell
smells
very
vinous
taste
is
strong
lots
of
dry
raisin
and
dark
grape
darker
taste
similar
to
st
bernardus
abt
12
but
overall
i
didnt
find
nearly
as
much
complexity
in
this
brew
this
is
one
of
the
most
overrated
beers
on
both
this
site
and
ratebeer
still
very
enjoyable
however
especially
if
you
like
the
belgian
abbottquadrupels
im
also
not
that
big
of
a
fan
of
the
style
so
that
may
sway
my
view
as
well
if
you
like
quadrupels
youll
love
this
beer
either
way
a
very
nice
and
drinkable
quad
low
on
the
phenols
and
high
on
the
licorice
probably
one
of
my
favorite
quads
to
date
q
recommended
a
you
bet
d
dangerously
drinkable
the
high
abv
is
hidden
perfectly
cant
tell
its
there
until
the
warmth
washes
over
you
half
way
through
the
bottle
thick
brown
pour
fluffy
creamy
head
malty
raisin
aromas
dark
alcohol
lost
of
different
sweet
tastes
malt
caramel
some
dark
fruit
at
first
this
definetely
improved
as
it
warmed
mellowed
and
became
a
little
more
sweet
malty
like
an
old
ale
pretty
warming
i
dont
find
the
alcohol
that
offensive
or
even
that
present
some
lacing
throughout
the
best
quad
ive
had
for
sure
d
sipper
but
not
because
its
too
heavy
but
something
i
want
to
savor
high
alcohol
gives
it
some
knocks
however
there
may
be
the
only
complaint
although
its
not
really
a
complaint
dark
brown
beer
with
a
little
cloudiness
from
the
yeast
the
head
was
thick
and
heavy
and
barely
diminished
while
i
drank
the
beer
it
smelled
of
figs
or
raisins
with
some
maltiness
tasted
the
same
with
a
little
sweetness
i
detected
a
little
hop
bitterness
the
beer
felt
like
cream
in
my
mouth
i
did
notice
a
little
alcohol
bite
to
it
a
deep
oily
brown
color
cloudy
some
sediment
the
earthy
aroma
is
wrapped
with
leather
and
sweet
yeasty
bread
there
are
hints
of
spices
there
is
a
thin
tan
head
the
taste
is
earthy
and
figs
on
the
front
leather
and
oak
on
the
end
this
is
a
very
thick
chewy
beer
the
finish
is
sweet
yeasty
bread
this
complex
beer
is
very
balanced
scott
oxidation
a
little
more
present
in
the
taste
maybe
a
bit
of
a
rusty
metallic
note
but
not
dominating
a
lot
of
the
same
flavors
but
a
bit
more
fruitiness
rich
malts
and
stewed
dark
fruits
brown
sugar
nicely
carbonation
as
the
appearance
indicated
creating
a
very
satisfying
mediumbodied
mouthfeel
very
drinkable
for
its
abv
and
the
level
of
complexity
is
very
high
a
definite
winner
fresh
or
aged
i
really
wouldnt
see
a
need
to
push
it
more
than
5
years
though
pours
darker
brown
than
the
8
with
some
sediment
the
head
is
just
as
big
but
thinner
and
dissipates
quickly
nose
is
heavier
in
the
malt
with
toffee
and
alcohol
prominent
lighter
mouthfeel
than
the
8
malts
dates
and
currants
dominate
the
taste
kind
of
a
light
cognac
finish
that
comes
out
as
the
beer
warms
unfortunately
so
does
the
alcohol
both
are
great
but
i
like
the
8
better
i
first
tried
it
years
ago
while
i
was
in
the
military
in
europe
i
recently
bought
12
bottles
directly
from
belgium
shipping
was
a
killer
but
still
worth
it
everything
about
this
beer
is
near
perfect
very
strong
but
alcohol
is
hidden
very
well
deep
dark
color
with
a
nice
tan
head
smells
like
heaven
the
trademark
belgian
spiced
malts
and
rich
fermented
fruits
is
just
fantastic
this
one
really
warms
ya
up
d
the
tastes
in
this
beer
are
quite
complex
as
is
typical
with
belgians
this
is
classicly
belgian
with
an
abv
that
will
kick
you
right
in
the
crotch
in
a
heartbeat
i
find
the
alcohol
isnt
quite
as
blended
in
with
this
one
its
lurking
its
biting
head
one
glass
is
about
the
extent
of
any
indulging
of
this
one
tastes
wonderful
just
too
strong
in
the
alcohol
department
pours
a
nice
dark
brown
with
a
frothy
tan
head
aroma
of
dark
fruits
and
malty
caramel
extremely
smooth
tating
beer
whcih
is
surprising
given
the
high
abv
hints
of
dark
fruit
caramel
and
chocolate
with
a
slightly
dry
finish
this
is
my
favorite
beer
d
a
little
alchohol
burn
toward
the
end
this
is
still
a
fresh
bottle
so
im
sure
it
will
mellow
with
age
but
i
couldnt
wait
to
drink
this
gem
an
excellent
beer
all
around
but
this
could
perhaps
benefit
from
some
age
pour
a
murky
mahogany
with
nice
beligan
light
chocolate
foam
nose
has
been
boozy
at
times
when
good
smells
like
nothing
but
pilsner
hop
at
first
beligan
sugar
yet
smooth
preserve
like
plum
fig
pumpkin
seed
leather
apricot
and
brown
sugar
excellent
volume
no
alcohol
detected
in
a
good
bottle
palate
is
everything
the
nose
is
and
gradually
smooth
with
a
like
hop
wit
h
a
nice
leather
malt
finish
has
a
lamb
meat
quality
astringent
hop
peppery
and
clove
like
would
recommend
obviously
with
lamb
fantastic
for
game
period
overall
frankly
its
just
not
my
thing
the
complexity
of
the
beer
and
the
prowess
of
the
brewery
is
undeniable
but
for
me
its
nearundrinkable
drinkability
im
kinda
wishing
i
would
have
tried
one
last
year
i
think
the
aging
has
affected
it
for
the
worse
ive
had
a
few
fresh
and
they
were
a
bit
better
than
this
still
an
excellent
beer
but
prefer
them
fresher
overall
impression
this
was
not
what
i
was
expecting
to
be
honest
i
have
not
loved
many
belgians
this
one
however
i
like
quite
a
bit
it
is
definitely
a
sipping
beer
and
at
the
prices
they
go
for
here
probably
one
ill
sip
infrequently
though
when
i
do
ill
enjoy
it
i
still
like
st
bernadus
abt
12
better
as
a
quad
this
is
an
extremely
complex
beer
and
one
that
all
belgian
lovers
should
endeavour
to
try
i
did
enjoy
it
a
lot
but
did
not
find
it
to
be
a
stellar
leap
over
other
classics
and
in
fact
i
though
the
rochefort
8
was
superior
in
terms
of
appearance
and
mouthfeel
in
terms
of
quads
this
kicks
almost
all
of
them
into
touch
and
from
the
ones
i
have
had
only
st
bernardus
would
beat
it
in
my
eyes
d
this
drink
plain
scares
me
i
have
had
beers
at
a
third
of
the
abv
that
were
harder
to
drink
this
is
such
a
decadent
beer
it
makes
you
feel
special
it
makes
you
remember
that
beer
is
not
a
drink
to
pound
down
or
at
least
not
always
amazing
quite
an
experience
you
have
to
try
it
outstanding
one
of
the
best
ive
ever
had
d

abv
drinkability
is
subjective
but
for
this
level
of
alcohol
its
as
drinkable
as
it
gets
everyone
should
enjoy
this
beer
at
some
time
before
they
die
surely
a
great
beer
but
id
probably
get
a
koeningshoven
or
a
quadrium
before
this
one
in
deference
to
the
beer
and
brewer
who
knows
how
this
beer
has
changed
since
in
left
belgium
for
alaska
i
think
i
like
pannepot
better
but
this
is
a
world
class
brew
pours
a
dark
reddish
brown
with
about
a
finger
of
light
tan
head
that
exhibits
fairly
good
retention
smells
pretty
good
some
nice
malty
sweetness
some
dark
fruit
esters
and
a
complex
alcohol
aroma
the
aroma
here
is
very
vinous
with
lots
dark
fruits
such
as
plums
figs
and
dark
cherries
alcohol
aroma
is
both
spicy
and
a
bit
like
perfume
taste
is
much
like
the
aroma
initially
its
fairly
malty
but
sweetness
quickly
builds
the
dark
fruit
esters
are
a
constant
and
lurk
just
beneath
the
sweetness
as
this
brew
warms
a
bit
the
flavors
actually
seem
to
come
together
a
bit
more
they
mellow
a
bit
and
this
becomes
much
more
balanced
mouthfeel
is
pretty
good
mediumlight
in
body
with
high
carbonation
there
is
a
very
prominent
alcohol
presence
here
but
its
not
overwhelming
or
harsh
as
the
alcohol
takes
on
perfume
like
characteristics
drinkability
is
pretty
good
i
had
expected
a
bit
more
out
of
this
beer
but
it
was
enjoyable
nonetheless
drinkabiltiy
with
the
high
alcohol
this
guy
is
a
sipper
and
the
alcohol
makes
it
a
bit
tough
to
knock
down
that
said
paired
with
some
nice
artisanal
cheeses
and
candied
fruits
and
you
have
yourself
an
enjoyable
experience
future
outlook
im
sure
that
this
beer
will
meet
again
with
my
mouth
somewhere
down
the
road
d
a
very
flavorful
and
complicated
beer
if
you
concentrate
you
can
pick
out
its
various
characteristics
would
love
to
be
pairing
this
with
a
desert
as
it
seems
lonely
to
consume
all
on
its
own
d
great
but
the
abv
is
so
high
you
would
get
sloppy
very
quickly
probably
the
best
quad
that
i
have
had
to
date
still
got
a
westy
12
to
drink
soon
though
so
we
shall
see
if
that
stands
as
far
as
im
concerned
this
is
on
par
with
westvleteren
12
and
seeing
as
i
have
immediate
availability
to
this
beer
i
prefer
this
one
notes
awesome
example
of
the
style
maybe
its
not
the
greatest
beer
in
the
world
but
its
absolutely
one
of
my
always
in
stock
beers
and
the
one
i
grab
in
a
pub
if
theres
nothing
else
really
interesting
especially
at
the
end
of
a
great
evening
its
a
pity
that
its
less
spicy
than
it
used
to
be
and
has
become
sweeter
as
well
according
to
the
general
trend
but
still
a
well
balanced
very
flavourful
great
looking
and
easy
going
beer
for
such
high
abv
d
this
is
a
really
solid
brew
easy
to
drink
and
very
dangerous
highly
recommended
on
this
one
d
a
world
class
sipper
and
still
one
of
my
top
5
favorite
belgian
ales
worthy
of
all
the
hype
despite
the
abv
i
could
happily
drink
a
few
of
these
in
an
evening
the
body
is
big
as
expected
very
smooth
overall
with
a
silky
texture
great
complexity
carbonation
is
light
for
style
but
does
allow
all
the
flavors
to
come
out
some
heat
from
the
alcohol
is
a
bit
of
a
deterrent
overall
a
great
quad
with
some
minor
malt
notes
that
imo
are
off
great
yeast
representation
with
a
bit
of
heat
but
still
very
nice
this
is
a
full
bodied
brew
a
very
rich
and
the
awesome
taste
lingers
in
your
mouth
begging
for
another
sip
this
is
by
no
means
a
sessionable
beer
however
the
drinkability
on
this
is
astounding
d
a
very
enjoyable
beer
to
sip
on
the
high
alchol
will
limit
the
amount
consumed
at
any
one
time
a
very
good
beer
d
very
good

this
is
the
best
beer
ive
ever
had
the
pleasure
of
drinking
i
knew
this
as
i
smelled
it
i
hadnt
even
had
a
sip
yet
it
pours
a
beautiful
dark
ruby
with
a
nice
creamy
head
this
beer
has
so
much
flavor
that
its
almost
hard
to
handle
strong
fruits
and
malt
alcohol
is
strong
and
you
definitely
know
its
there
but
its
blended
well
im
going
to
buy
a
few
more
of
these
so
i
can
drink
the
last
one
in
the
fridge
and
same
some
for
different
special
occasions
if
you
see
this
beer
available
near
you
buy
it
deep
and
somewhat
murky
ruby
brown
a
gorgeous
tight
and
frothy
head
rises
up
with
tiny
little
bubble
and
amazing
retention
leaves
spots
of
sticky
lacing
down
the
glass
and
doesnt
fade
below
a
nice
cap
for
the
entire
session
smell
is
very
lovely
and
something
i
couldnt
quite
get
used
to
a
nice
fruit
scent
along
with
rich
malts
figs
and
plum
with
lightly
toasted
caramel
and
toffee
also
chocolate
it
also
has
a
distinct
leathery
aroma
that
i
find
appealing
great
taste
as
well
nice
spice
and
yeast
that
compliment
the
other
flavors
of
this
brew
some
brown
sugar
is
added
to
the
mix
caramel
is
still
there
and
the
chocolate
is
also
present
a
superb
mouthfeel
that
is
so
soft
and
creamy
on
the
tongue
silky
smooth
with
a
slight
peppery
spice
to
compliment
the
feel
toward
the
end
just
the
slightest
warm
dryness
in
the
finish
but
a
welcome
one
indeed
reminding
one
that
this
is
a
sipper
to
savor
i
really
like
this
one
had
it
once
before
but
didnt
appreciate
the
experience
so
much
this
is
one
to
remember
and
definitely
one
ill
come
back
to
with
colder
months
ahead
d
this
isnt
sessionable
but
you
shouldnt
expect
it
to
be
its
a
quad
for
godsakes
for
what
it
is
a
quad
the
alcohol
is
pretty
well
hidden
i
only
got
warming
which
is
nice
so
i
can
safely
say
this
is
drinkable
excellent
almost
up
to
the
stbernardus
12
d
very
drinkable
this
is
a
great
winter
warmer
or
dessert
beer
this
is
a
great
beer
and
i
feel
like
it
has
been
a
pleasure
letting
the
alcohol
sneak
up
on
me
an
amazingly
complex
beer
one
of
my
favorite
it
not
favorite
quads
i
wish
they
bottled
this
in
a
750ml
bottle
because
11
2oz
is
not
enough
drinkability
if
you
like
trappist
beer
or
belgians
for
the
most
part
then
prepare
to
make
room
at
the
top
of
your
list
for
this
one
would
love
to
try
it
on
tap
great
perfume
some
sweetness
dark
rich
balanced
great
finish
it
really
has
it
all
and
you
can
enjoy
a
12oz
bottle
yourself
very
complex
malt
smoke
wood
roasted
quality
and
great
texture
dark
christmas
spice
with
carmel
really
enjoyable
and
glad
it
is
somewhat
available
all
the
time
hail
to
the
trappistes
dupon
taste
wouldnt
have
guessed
11
3
abv
but
this
is
serious
stuff
a
warming
sipper
alcohol
let
you
know
that
it
is
there
but
over
all
very
drinkable
notes
i
certainly
respect
this
beer
it
has
an
uncommon
complexity
that
is
rare
it
has
that
great
begginning
and
just
before
the
punch
of
alcohol
there
is
a
wonderful
sweet
malty
taste
but
then
that
tremendous
body
slam
of
alcohol
followed
by
a
long
aftertaste
of
complex
malt
and
hops
drinking
the
ale
was
a
delight
and
i
found
it
smoother
than
the
rochefort
8
yet
with
the
same
chocolate
and
cocoa
flavours
being
so
dark
and
full
the
10
is
a
very
rich
beer
and
definitely
not
a
beer
that
you
would
want
to
be
drinking
as
though
it
was
a
run
of
the
mill
lager
despite
the
smoothness
of
the
beer
there
is
also
a
slight
touch
of
bitterness
adding
a
nice
counterpoint
to
the
sweetness
like
burnt
caramel
in
the
final
taste
though
there
was
a
distinct
alcohol
taste
this
is
a
very
complex
and
well
crafted
beer
i
enjoy
it
but
my
heart
lies
with
rockefort
8
d
delicious
and
beyond
drinkable
tough
to
even
do
this
one
justice
overall
very
good
despite
being
a
sipper
and
11
3
abv
i
could
easily
session
this
if
i
wasnt
on
a
college
student
budget
d
cant
drink
this
all
night
but
that
is
not
the
point
is
it
maybe
two
and
call
it
good
edit
a
year
later
to
the
day
completely
by
accident
i
am
revisiting
this
beer
and
enjoying
it
as
much
or
more
than
the
first
time
dated
for
the
last
day
of
2013
this
is
still
reasonably
fresh
mouthfeel
is
better
than
i
remembered
being
much
softer
on
the
palate
still
one
of
my
favorites
drinkability
i
love
this
quad
its
not
an
everyday
beer
obviously
but
one
very
drinkable
quad
this
beer
pours
a
hazy
dark
brownreddish
hue
with
a
small
creamy
offwhite
head
the
nose
is
a
combination
of
dark
fruits
like
raisins
and
figs
candy
sugar
slight
banana
fruity
esters
and
you
can
smell
the
alcohol
in
this
beer
as
well
the
taste
is
quite
complex
with
the
main
players
being
banana
dark
fruit
caramel
sweetness
vanilla
and
some
peppery
spices
a
really
nice
combination
of
flavors
and
they
work
really
well
together
in
this
quad
the
mouthfeel
is
medium
bodied
and
quite
smooth
with
moderate
carbonation
and
i
certainly
get
the
warming
alcohol
on
the
mouthfeel
as
well
the
drinkability
is
really
quite
nice
for
a
beer
that
is
11
3
abv
but
it
is
a
sipper
and
not
your
everyday
type
beer
drinkability
you
can
have
just
one
and
be
very
happy
or
still
want
for
more
this
is
a
serious
beer
i
prefer
have
one
and
meditate
on
how
great
it
is
overall
this
is
a
very
good
beer
the
trappists
really
know
how
to
make
a
good
one
pours
a
dark
thick
brown
with
no
light
seeping
through
a
lot
of
chunks
and
has
a
thick
offwhite
head
aroma
is
off
honey
and
fruit
slight
maltiness
taste
is
complex
some
ripe
fruits
and
malts
but
on
the
sweet
side
texture
is
excellent
on
the
chewy
side
and
is
thick
and
heavy
a
very
good
session
beer
but
with
the
high
abv
and
since
it
is
on
the
sweet
side
no
more
than
a
couple
at
a
sitting
very
enjoyable
beer
one
of
my
favorites
mouthfeel
was
zesty
with
tingly
carbonation
medium
to
full
density
somewhat
hot
in
the
throat
for
a
quad
of
11
very
drinkable
i
enjoyed
this
excellent
beverage
with
some
sharp
cheese
a
masterpiece
d
definitely
a
beer
to
sip
though
no
trouble
finding
my
way
to
the
bottom
of
the
glass
for
my
money
from
these
monks
i
think
ill
stick
with
the
rocherfort
8
poured
out
of
a
330
ml
bottle
served
in
a
small
chalice
dark
brown
appearance
with
a
good
head
and
lacing
had
a
raisiny
peppery
nose
i
thought
the
taste
was
excellent
grapes
malt
alcohol
comes
through
but
i
was
not
overwhelmed
by
it
i
love
this
beer
this
is
definitely
a
beauty
full
bodied
and
complex
with
almost
a
sherry
like
warming
not
for
the
faint
of
heart
but
if
you
like
abbey
traps
youll
probably
love
this
one
overall
a
definite
top
10
beer
the
flavors
are
so
complex
in
this
beer
it
makes
it
a
treat
it
is
really
quite
sophisticated
for
most
it
wouldnt
be
considered
a
beer
due
to
its
complexity
for
the
beer
geek
it
is
bliss
amazing
beer
md
the
lively
carbonation
did
this
one
well
and
the
drinkability
is
very
high
the
huge
abv
is
hidden
very
nicely
a
dark
brown
pour
is
topped
with
a
hearty
two
finger
rolling
dark
tan
head
head
retention
is
average
and
leaves
behind
an
uneven
lacing
all
around
the
glass
sediment
chunks
float
throughout
and
theres
a
dark
swirly
spot
of
something
or
the
other
in
the
middle
of
the
head
smells
sweet
with
some
licorice
chocolate
and
malts
being
most
evident
a
biscuity
base
is
also
evident
a
panoply
of
chocolate
caramel
and
licorice
candies
light
up
the
taste
buds
in
the
front
with
some
grapes
and
apples
in
the
middle
all
followed
by
some
invigorating
spice
and
hops
mouthfeel
is
medium
to
full
bodied
and
well
carbonated
while
the
alcohol
is
almost
nondescript
this
brew
exudes
quality
but
theres
a
little
something
missing
that
keep
its
from
attaining
godliness
an
aged
bottle
is
preferred
for
my
tastes
and
ill
rate
one
again
in
the
future
poured
into
the
proper
glassware
the
10
is
a
dark
very
opaque
brown
with
an
offwhite
head
not
much
foam
and
it
doesnt
really
last
lacing
is
not
extraordinary
smells
of
malt
caramelized
sugar
alcohol
hops
and
spices
along
with
a
somewhat
unappetizing
fruit
character
that
borders
on
rotten
tastes
quite
malty
up
front
with
plumlike
esters
chocolatetoffee
spices
and
some
medicinal
phenols
this
is
a
fresh
bottle
and
the
alcohol
is
quite
brazen
full
bodied
but
carbonation
is
a
bit
high
an
interesting
sipper
but
certainly
not
very
drinkable
by
nature
and
easily
the
worst
of
the
rochefort
beers
dwould
drink
100
but
would
be
on
the
floor
after
6
or
so
perhaps
the
best
beer
i
have
put
to
my
lips
its
really
as
simple
as
that
smooth
balanced
tasteful
definitely
sweet
tasting
i
knock
it
down
on
the
smell
category
simply
because
there
wasnt
much
to
smell
with
clear
sinuses
i
picked
up
almost
nothing
but
beyond
a
doubt
what
it
lacks
in
aroma
is
more
than
made
up
in
taste
this
is
a
special
beer
and
has
even
brought
the
entire
stylebelgian
aleup
to
one
of
my
favorites
absolutely
worth
it
the
cost
is
high
but
you
wont
regret
the
splurge
da
wonderful
belgian
quad
certainly
deserving
of
its
ranking
although
it
carries
a
high
abv
i
wouldnt
count
that
against
its
drinkability
while
not
sessionable
in
the
typical
sense
this
is
definitely
a
quad
that
a
person
could
have
a
couple
of
beers
and
really
enjoy
the
experience
of
drinks
one
of
the
worlds
best
beers
medium
body
fantastic
drinkability
its
definitely
a
sipper
though
there
is
a
damn
good
reason
this
beer
is
in
the
top
ten
pours
a
dark
brown
color
with
maybe
some
hints
of
crimson
on
the
side
a
decent
tan
colored
head
and
good
lacing
cap
sticks
around
wonderful
aroma
of
chocolate
grass
caramel
dark
fruits
and
deliciously
sweet
no
hops
taste
is
much
better
than
i
remember
not
as
much
weird
earthy
funkiness
but
theres
notes
of
apple
skin
chocolate
plums
light
raisin
and
molasses
yumm
this
is
much
much
better
this
finish
long
with
a
yeast
and
minty
herbal
like
quality
on
the
back
of
the
tongue
i
cant
even
believe
my
old
review
mouthfeel
is
full
but
carbonation
is
a
little
high
at
first
but
slowly
mellows
with
some
swirls
this
bottle
is
about
2
years
old
so
its
holding
up
quite
well
a
very
good
beer
and
satisfied
my
recent
desire
for
a
quad
d
ill
have
one
any
day
but
not
2
with
the
11
3
abv
its
hard
for
me
to
review
this
beer
cause
im
not
sure
i
have
the
experiance
yet
to
fully
give
it
the
review
it
deserves
all
i
can
really
say
is
that
the
complexities
and
balance
on
it
are
the
best
i
have
ever
had
very
rich
and
smooth
everything
comes
through
with
every
drink
you
take
perfect
carbonation
level
and
a
very
warming
brew
ill
be
setting
2
of
these
back
for
later
and
haopefully
ill
be
able
to
do
a
better
review
next
time
i
have
it
an
outstanding
brew
deserving
of
the
rep
and
the
hype
d
very
drinkable
in
spite
of
the
alcohol
content
although
with
a
beer
this
delicious
and
complex
whod
want
to
rush
dhigh
abv
make
for
a
one
in
a
setting
brew
it
is
definitely
a
good
beer
but
i
doubt
id
have
more
than
one
in
a
sitting
d
oh
my
this
is
one
very
good
beer
the
abv
is
well
hidden
drinkability
well
whats
not
to
love
about
this
one
a
dangerously
tasty
and
wellcrafted
beer
and
well
worth
the
7
50
i
paid
for
it
alcohol
is
high
but
never
harsh
or
chemically
and
the
sheer
complexity
of
the
beer
makes
every
percentage
point
worth
it
highly
recommended
but
i
didnt
need
to
tell
anyone
that
now
did
i
pours
a
dark
dark
brown
that
looks
a
bit
tealike
when
held
up
to
light
the
head
is
big
and
rocky
and
dissipates
fairly
quickly
leaving
little
lacing
the
smell
is
hugely
complex
and
dominated
by
dark
fruits
and
spices
plums
grapes
cinnamon
pepper
the
taste
is
much
like
the
aroma
but
has
a
much
bigger
belgian
yeast
flavor
that
then
gives
way
to
huge
dark
fruit
flavors
along
with
a
bit
of
brown
sugar
and
caramel
the
mouthfeel
is
full
bodied
with
big
carbonation
that
dance
over
the
tongue
this
is
one
helluva
wellcrafted
beer
and
extremely
drinkable
despite
the
abv
highly
recommended
pours
a
deep
mahogany
color
beautiful
dense
looks
like
you
could
float
a
quarter
on
this
thing
sandcolored
head
rises
fades
slowly
and
leaves
a
small
amount
of
lacing
on
the
glass
smell
is
spicy
dark
fruit
rich
malty
textures
one
of
the
better
examples
of
a
beer
where
the
smells
become
much
more
pronounced
as
it
warms
taste
delivers
on
the
dark
fruit
im
getting
some
fig
spicy
alcohol
some
molasses
somewhat
nutty
really
creamy
mouthfeel
great
warming
alcohol
lots
of
lingering
spiciness
this
is
excellent
pours
a
cloudy
medium
brown
color
with
fluffy
tan
head
smells
mildly
of
raisins
figs
and
tastes
mildly
of
raisins
figs
plums
some
cinnamon
but
the
whole
thing
was
spoiled
by
a
hint
of
vinegar
the
flavors
just
arent
very
strong
and
the
vinegar
flavor
ruined
it
for
me
doesnt
compare
with
st
b
at
all
nor
with
westy
poured
smooth
from
the
bottle
i
had
this
after
the
rochefort
8
and
immediately
noticed
the
heavier
malts
and
fruity
esters
there
is
plum
and
raisin
along
with
a
nice
malt
head
left
fine
lacings
down
the
glass
i
liked
this
beer
very
much
but
i
couldnt
see
having
more
than
one
in
a
sitting
i
recommend
giving
it
a
try
d
for
the
alcohol
content
i
could
drink
this
stuff
all
night
i
keep
trying
to
cellar
this
beer
but
im
unable
to
stop
drinking
up
my
stock
pours
a
dark
murky
brown
with
a
thin
head
that
lasts
as
a
thin
layer
aroma
was
an
abundance
of
burnt
caramel
dried
fruits
and
molasses
taste
is
an
absolute
plethora
of
all
good
things
you
could
imagine
in
a
beer
caramel
toffee
maple
dried
fruits
slight
bitter
chocolate
coffee
the
could
go
on
and
on
the
beer
is
full
bodied
but
not
overpowering
at
all
actually
very
smooth
this
is
certainly
one
of
those
truly
special
beers
that
is
worthy
of
the
ba
top
ten
ill
definitely
have
this
one
again
d
great
sipper
solid
very
enjoyed
pours
dark
brown
root
beer
color
very
cloudy
it
has
a
116
inch
off
white
head
smells
of
toasted
malts
nuts
and
herbal
hops
first
sip
is
creamy
smooooth
complex
almost
chewy
this
beer
blows
my
mind
it
tastes
strong
as
the
11
3
abv
is
not
hidden
it
is
in
your
face
yet
it
tastes
kind
of
light
and
somehow
this
brew
is
so
damn
creamy
d
a
shame
its
not
a
bit
colder
outside
as
the
abv
is
certainly
a
bit
warming
is
this
beer
drinkable
its
rochefort
so
yes
a
truly
worldclass
beer
drinking
brings
back
many
fond
memories
of
my
introduction
to
good
beer
through
belgians
when
i
was
younger
a
true
joy
that
every
ba
should
experience
poured
bottle
into
a
affligem
goblet
pours
a
murky
dark
brown
with
a
thin
off
white
head
the
head
dies
quickly
and
beer
seems
to
have
little
carbonation
smells
are
amazing
lots
of
sugary
malts
burnt
sugars
and
some
alcohol
some
dark
fruit
in
there
too
taste
is
complex
lots
of
different
flavors
but
everything
works
flawlessly
some
raisins
and
dark
fruit
some
alcohol
yet
finishes
crisply
and
dryly
still
finishes
sweetly
too
i
cannot
believe
how
easy
this
11
is
to
drink
i
finished
the
beer
and
was
completely
upset
that
it
was
gone
cant
wait
to
have
another
d
still
a
great
beer
not
better
or
worse
than
fresh
just
mellow
and
different
had
been
looking
forward
to
trying
this
beer
for
a
while
now
boy
was
i
disappointed
i
honestly
cannot
think
of
one
redeeming
quality
about
this
beer
it
started
off
well
the
appearance
was
a
very
nice
copper
color
the
smell
was
awful
it
smelled
like
rotten
fruit
and
upon
drinking
it
did
not
get
any
better
very
bitter
and
sour
tasting
not
pleasant
at
all
by
far
the
most
disappointing
beer
i
have
ever
had
i
am
hoping
that
i
just
had
a
bad
bottle
but
after
talking
with
others
it
seems
that
this
is
the
norm
now
for
rochefort
this
bottle
of
goodness
travelled
all
the
way
from
southern
belgium
where
it
is
brewed
by
one
of
the
only
trappist
breweries
in
the
world
rochefort
makes
three
ales
the
6
the
8
and
the
10
i
recently
purchased
a
10
at
new
beer
in
manhattan
and
aside
from
having
sampled
a
large
number
of
high
powered
trappist
ales
in
antwerp
over
the
summer
this
is
the
most
intense
and
amazing
beer
ive
ever
had
period
this
is
one
of
the
few
brews
that
i
have
had
which
are
deserving
of
the
life
is
beautiful
tag
whenever
theres
a
beer
that
theres
not
much
more
to
say
about
other
than
if
you
havent
had
this
you
havent
had
beer
ill
just
tag
it
like
that
to
keep
it
simple
rochefort
10
is
full
of
amazing
flavor
like
dried
fruits
and
other
dark
and
mysterious
things
theres
a
ton
of
alcohol
at
almost
11

anywhere
pinotboy007jun

id
like
to
larrytownjun
22
because
it
tastes
kinda
rough
and
yeasty
and
i
poured
it
correctly
i
will
give
this
another
shot
but
i
had
one
about
a
year
ago
like
a
cola
and
availability
lowers
the
drinkability

for

and
cooked
fruit
the
taste
is
reflective
or
aroma
and
heavy
alcohol
it
is
still
well
rounded
this
is
a
very
drinkable
beer
of
dark
ripe
fruits
and
spicy
with
a
slight
medicinal
alcohol
smell
this
reminds
me
of
drinking
whiskey
very
warming
to
the
throat
and
mouth
the
flavor
isnt
as
deep
and
complex
as
i
thought
it
was
going
to
be
it
mostly
just
tastes
like
dark
ripe
fruit
and
alcohol
it
does
taste
better
as
it
warms
though
but
still
mostly
one
dimensional
similar
to
cough
syrup
slightly
drying
the
feel
is
tingly
from
the
carbonation
and

an
alltime
favourite
it
never
fails
to
satisfy
and
amaze
me
incredibly
drinkable
for
such
a
big
beer
i
dont
have
to
take
my
time
with
this
one
quite
like
i
do
with
say
a
samichlaus
or
expedition
stout
delicious
prosit
mk
similar
to
the
rochefort
8
but
a
bit
more
subtle
and
stronger
one
of
my
favorites
highly
recommended
this
was
the
beer
that
got
me
into
drinking
belgian
beers
it
you
want
a
great
belgian
beer
and
you
do
not
have
access
to
a
westvleteren
12
you
should
drink
this
beer
because
it
is
a
great
beer
and
you
will
not
be
missing
much
i
may
be
out
of
line
but
i
think
this
beer
is
as
good
as
a
westie
d
one
of
my
favorite
belgian
beers
of
any
style
its
been
quite
a
while
since
ive
tried
this
one
and
at
67bottle
its
not
cheap
oh
how
i
lament
seeing
those
4packs
in
belgium
for
under
4
but
its
remarkably
good
and
certainly
easy
to
drink
at
any
cost
its
a
worldclass
beer
worth
seeking
out
a
classic
enjoy
dthe
hotness
of
this
brew
is
slightly
off
putting
but
disapears
once
you
let
it
warm
up
a
bit
once
that
happens
it
is
a
very
good
beer
the
caramel
sweetness
makes
it
a
nice
balanced
beer
very
nice
brown
colour
flavour
with
burned
carame
and
well
balanced
between
sweet
and
bitter
is
maybe
to
the
sweet
side
lovely
alcoholic
bite
sweet
alcohol
and
slightly
bitter
finish
full
bodied
my
favourite
trappist
beer
also
compared
to
westvleteren
12
its
below
freezing
outside
and
this
beer
really
hits
the
spot
a
very
well
balanced
and
amazingly
tasty
beer
d
drinkability
is
good
the
beer
is
complex
and
plays
the
part
of
the
sipping
beer
very
well
beer
is
the
great
think
humans
has
discovered
drinkability
this
is
a
fantastic
quad
and
its
uniquely
roasty
for
the
style
without
deviating
too
far
from
the
style
guidelines
quaffability
suffers
as
the
alcohol
becomes
very
noticeable
at
the
finish
as
the
beer
warms
but
it
does
contributed
positive
characteristics
to
the
taste
fantastic
beer
overall
well
worth
a
try
damazingly
smooth
and
delicious
id
like
to
try
aging
a
few
bottles
to
see
the
result
the
alcohol
burn
is
a
bit
much
right
now
the
bottle
is
only
about
4
months
old
toned
down
this
would
be
much
more
drinkable
as
it
stands
now
its
a
very
good
beer
ill
have
to
grab
a
few
more
and
hang
onto
them
for
a
few
years
to
see
what
happens
d
this
is
a
wonderful
treat
i
remember
once
seeing
a
table
a
hopleaf
where
three
guys
were
ordering
round
after
round
of
this
beer
at
10
a
bottle
i
was
shocked
and
after
drinking
it
i
still
cant
say
i
would
do
it
but
i
do
have
to
say
it
would
be
hard
for
too
many
other
beers
to
compete
with
this
balanced
and
complex
offering
the
nose
is
musty
and
earthy
not
particularly
pleasant
it
mellows
as
it
warms
with
a
whiff
of
gouda
cheese
taste
is
anice
from
black
licorice
and
slightly
peppery
alcohol
becomes
evident
in
the
finish
one
of
the
highest
ranked
beers
in
ba
yet
i
question
why
not
sure
why
the
disconnect
but
the
brew
is
too
uninspired
for
my
taste
d
with
all
that
flavor
its
a
sipper
with
or
without
the
11
3
abv
its
a
damn
fine
sipper
but
the
alcohol
is
a
bit
much
for
me
which
i
suppose
is
why
i
prefer
the
8
which
is
one
of
my
favorites
been
holding
onto
this
bottle
for
a
little
while
and
finally
decided
to
pop
it
tonight
tasted
a
lot
like
a
westvleteren
12
and
definitely
much
cheaper
for
us
in
the
states
plan
on
aging
other
bottles
for
a
significant
amount
of
time
one
of
the
best
quadrupels
i
have
ever
tasted
plan
on
drinking
the
6
and
8
soon
to
compare
them
to
the
other
trappist
beers
but
this
one
measured
up
nicely
definitely
deserves
to
be
in
the
top
twenty
beers
on
this
site
recommended
pours
black
with
with
a
deep
red
tint
to
it
the
head
is
a
2
finger
that
lingers
for
a
very
long
time
and
leaves
a
lot
of
lacing
on
the
glass
it
is
frothy
and
beautiful
the
aroma
is
of
sweet
cherries
dark
fruits
alcohol
and
malt
i
smell
no
hops
the
taste
is
very
well
balanced
and
very
complex
the
initial
taste
has
a
lot
of
sweet
malt
and
lots
of
alcohol
the
alcohol
continues
to
play
on
my
tongue
while
the
a
slight
hop
bitterness
balances
the
sweetness
nicely
the
grapecherry
flavor
is
in
the
finish
and
is
very
sweet
the
mouthfeel
is
excellent
and
the
beer
is
very
well
carbonated
the
beer
is
pretty
damn
drinkable
for
the
high
abv
drinkability
its
the
fullestbodied
trappist
ive
had
thus
far
and
its
absolutely
delicious
its
worth
every
bit
of
the
8bottle
so
sip
slowly
and
savor
i
love
belgium
a
great
warming
beer
for
a
cold
winter
day
very
nice
i
will
pick
this
up
whenever
i
have
a
chance
beer
poured
a
deep
dense
brown
color
with
a
half
inch
thick
tan
head
into
my
orval
glass
the
head
receeded
to
a
nice
ring
on
the
edge
by
the
time
i
sat
down
to
admire
my
beer
the
beer
had
an
aroma
of
toasted
malt
and
caramel
the
taste
is
malty
sweet
but
hoppy
and
well
balanced
the
body
is
full
of
carbonation
and
the
taste
is
slightly
hot
with
alcohol
but
this
is
a
very
well
balanced
and
full
bodied
beer
that
lives
up
to
its
billing
this
is
wonderful
easydrinking
stuff
thats
not
too
heavy
for
the
style
incredible
quadrupel
after
a
long
absence
in
this
market
i
finally
saw
some
more
of
this
stuff
with
a
best
before
date
of
101412
which
i
assume
means
it
was
bottled
in
october
of
2007
pours
a
nearly
opaque
mahogany
with
a
thick
cola
head
the
aroma
has
some
intense
dark
fruit
notes
upfront
along
with
some
candied
sugar
sweetness
bread
like
yeastiness
some
spices
corriander
cardamom
anise
and
a
touch
of
alcohol
the
flavor
is
similar
to
the
aroma
with
a
big
dark
fruit
plum
grape
fig
blackberry
presence
upfront
along
with
a
burnt
bread
flavor
some
spiciness
corriander
and
anise
a
slight
hint
of
floral
hops
and
a
nice
alcohol
presence
that
isnt
overwhelming
the
mouthfeel
is
smooth
with
moderate
carbonation
and
drinkability
is
excellent
for
the
style
overall
an
excellent
quad
drinkable
and
complex
hopefully
this
one
isnt
as
scarce
around
here
in
the
future
excellent
beer
medium
bodsy
with
what
i
would
call
frothy
carbonation
very
nice
and
warming
after
1
year
pours
with
lots
of
vigour
and
carbonation
looks
about
the
same
the
aroma
hits
you
with
the
vanilla
more
pronounced
than
before
and
the
dusty
cocoa
bitterness
coming
out
more
as
well
the
licorice
is
really
coming
out
in
the
flavour
deep
and
herbal
more
brilliant
than
even
half
a
year
ago
i
love
it
and
want
some
more
now
this
is
an
absolute
treat
for
quad
lovers
not
one
i
would
want
all
the
time
just
because
it
is
so
massive
i
think
it
is
something
you
should
treat
yourself
to
at
least
once
a
year
drinkability
is
hampered
by
the
high
alcohol
content
and
the
need
to
sip
very
slowly
still
drinkable
just
requires
some
patience
this
beer
transports
you
straight
to
the
old
world
i
got
out
the
strongest
cheese
i
could
find
in
the
fridge
some
gorgonzola
paired
the
two
together
and
just
sat
back
and
enjoyed
it
need
to
get
working
on
planning
that
belgian
brewery
tour
trappistes
rochefort
10
is
outstanding
beer
that
is
pretty
close
to
as
deep
and
as
complex
as
they
come
i
didnt
get
that
undefinable
magic
quality
that
i
look
for
in
the
best
of
the
best
but
its
an
amazingly
libation
all
the
same
its
also
every
bit
the
equal
of
trappist
westvleteren
12
truly
exceptional
my
third
and
final
installment
from
brasserie
de
rochefort
and
out
of
all
three
of
their
wellknown
beers
i
must
declare
that
my
favorite
was
the
8
their
10
pours
a
wonderful
deep
dark
brown
mahogany
appearance
with
an
immense
foamy
and
frothy
head
chestnuthue
was
very
attractive
with
a
faint
aroma
of
figs
and
prunes
the
smell
wasnt
as
strong
as
i
was
anticipating
the
taste
was
very
good
for
a
quadrupel
but
in
my
opinion
somewhat
bland
compared
to
the
8
their
was
an
apparent
thickness
and
richness
in
the
flavor
which
manifested
itself
with
a
nutty
butter
caramel
dehydrated
fruit
taste
good
creamy
rich
and
thick
mouthfeel
led
to
a
good
drinkability
although
the
alcohol
wasnt
detectable
the
11
3
abv
does
eventually
become
noticeable
with
a
warming
feeling
that
slowly
sinks
in
overall
a
very
good
beer
a
good
depiction
of
the
style
definitely
recommended
decanted
into
a
rochefort
goblet
the
beer
appears
as
a
slightly
hazy
deep
reddish
brown
color
with
deep
crimson
hues
a
voluminous
head
emerges
of
a
light
sandy
tan
color
that
nearly
spills
over
the
rim
of
the
goblet
an
absolutely
gorgeous
beer
in
every
way
the
nose
is
an
explosion
of
sweet
tropical
fruits
pear
banana
mango
some
candylike
characteristics
reminiscent
of
bubble
gum
and
hard
christmas
candy
underpinning
these
notes
a
solid
caramelized
malt
base
is
evident
this
is
one
of
the
most
enjoyable
beers
to
sniff
youll
ever
have
the
pleasure
of
enjoying
without
a
doubt
the
palate
is
a
myriad
of
complex
flavors
that
wholly
embody
the
essence
of
what
a
belgian
strong
dark
ale
ought
to
be
roasted
coconut
spicy
banana
and
pear
subtle
floral
hops
and
a
wonderfully
rich
warm
alcohol
presence
some
rich
chocolatelike
flavors
add
to
the
incredible
complexity
of
this
beer
the
mouth
feel
is
no
more
than
medium
and
not
cloying
in
the
least
even
with
the
aggressive
sweet
candi
and
fruit
elements
this
beer
contains
a
good
amount
of
carbonation
leaving
the
finish
clean
and
rather
dry
with
some
residual
alcohol
warmth
lingering
long
this
is
without
a
single
doubt
one
of
the
finest
beers
ive
ever
sampled
regardless
of
style
or
origin
this
beer
is
the
pinnacle
of
the
trappist
brewers
art
in
my
opinion
nearly
perfect
the
much
soughtafter
westvleteren
12
really
has
nothing
on
this
beer
if
you
want
to
taste
trappist
brewing
perfection
you
really
cant
do
any
better
than
the
best
of
the
rochefort
beers
and
one
of
the
best
in
the
world
rochefort
10
drinkability
is
in
question
as
this
is
a
lovable
and
highly
palatable
beer
but
the
buzz
oh
the
buzz
from
the
11
3abv
d
excellent
to
sip
at
i
started
the
bottle
with
a
clean
palate
for
the
sake
of
review
being
hungry
though
after
half
a
bottle
i
paired
it
with
baguette
spread
with
a
brunet
goat
cheese
this
was
absolutely
excellent
bring
out
some
of
the
tangy
sweetness
in
the
ale
a
wonderful
abbeyale
and
something
special
to
keep
away
for
a
special
occasion
or
when
the
westy
is
unavailable
like
here
this
thing
is
very
good
the
carbonation
has
died
down
a
bit
and
now
there
is
some
dark
cherry
notes
coming
through
as
well
this
is
a
world
class
brew
im
going
to
have
to
stock
up
and
age
a
few
of
these
overall
a
very
drinkable
quad
a
good
introduction
into
really
good
belgians
this
beer
is
phenomenal
i
am
still
totally
in
awe
of
it
wish
i
could
have
another
right
now
geez
im
still
in
awe
of
this
beer
from
now
on
when
i
purchase
the
rocheforts
it
will
be
the
10
an
nothing
else
this
beer
is
godly
this
is
a
fantastic
beer
lives
up
to
its
reputation
fanfriggintastic
the
best
of
the
trappists
that
ive
had
and
its
hard
to
imagine
that
the
westy
12
could
be
better
than
this
the
bottom
line
if
you
like
belgians
the
rochefort
beers
are
must
tries
i
greatly
enjoy
both
the
8
and
the
10
and
10
is
the
biggest
beer
in
their
impressive
arsenal
it
loses
a
bit
as
it
warms
which
is
unusual
for
the
style
though
as
the
alcohol
becomes
more
noticeable
thinnerbodied
as
is
typical
of
most
belgian
brews
easy
to
drink
one
too
fast
because
at
11
this
deserves
respectful
sipping
that
alcohol
hits
me
about
half
way
through
the
carbonation
is
very
lively
on
the
tongue
i
must
say
this
beer
just
made
my
day
id
choose
this
over
many
other
dark
belgians
except
for
rochefort
8
overall
well
worth
the
money
and
well
worth
the
hype
d
a
delicious
night
cap
sipper
im
glad
this
is
readily
available
in
my
area
but
6
a
pop
is
a
bit
steep
for
more
than
an
occasional
treat
near
perfect
example
of
style
complexities
grow
as
it
warms
ages
well
for
many
years
world
class
d
an
absolute
requirement
for
ultimate
sainthood
but
then
again
in
reverentlysavored
smaller
quantity
a
wonderful
experience
and
one
ill
be
sure
to
repeat
drinkability
a
sipping
beer
a
reminiscence
beer
this
beer
always
leaves
a
wonderful
warm
feeling
in
my
tummy
the
best
beer
i
have
tasted
yep
this
is
my
favorite
belgian
so
far
by
a
long
way
the
alcohol
is
very
prevalent
so
this
is
a
sipper
but
this
is
actually
one
belgian
that
i
will
get
again
and
enjoy
again
overall
while
it
is
complex
i
feel
that
it
is
not
as
complex
as
i
imagined
i
am
going
to
age
the
other
one
i
have
for
a
while
and
revisit
this
brew
nice
brew
though
it
is
obvious
why
it
is
rated
so
highly
sticks
to
the
style
and
represents
it
very
well
d
thanks
to
my
buddy
scott
for
splitting
this
with
me
they
arent
cheap
but
i
just
might
have
to
get
some
more
of
these
good
sipping
drinkability
excellent
example
of
a
quad
glad
i
found
this
this
beer
is
a
an
opaque
brown
with
a
beautiful
creamy
head
that
subsides
to
a
laceing
the
beer
smells
of
toasty
roasty
chocolate
and
crystal
malt
and
tastes
very
similar
the
taste
is
smooth
with
creamy
roasted
malt
finish
a
caramel
flavor
with
belgium
yeastyness
is
noticeable
the
mouthfeel
is
soft
with
a
smooth
maltyness
light
medium
body
and
delicate
carbonation
wonderful
taste
but
alcohol
is
present
although
an
important
part
of
the
complex
balance
of
flavors
making
it
less
drinkable
damn
good
beer
at
7bottle
you
expect
the
moon
and
receive
the
galaxy
this
is
eons
better
than
the
8
which
is
one
of
my
favorites
overall
you
cant
go
wrong
with
this
one
lots
of
flavours
blended
in
as
it
warms
its
even
better
my
only
complaint
is
that
i
didnt
have
more
a
must
for
belgian
lovers
pours
an
extremely
dark
brown
with
quite
a
bit
of
head
that
recedes
fairly
quickly
smell
is
of
a
thick
sweet
malt
taste
is
extremely
sweet
the
flavor
drops
off
a
bit
quickly
but
not
drastically
so
it
stays
on
your
tongue
for
a
while
and
you
get
a
alcohol
taste
that
disappears
before
all
the
flavor
does
as
well
mouthfeel
is
not
as
thick
as
i
would
expect
drinkability
is
high
though
you
will
feel
this
one
fast
taste
wasrich
with
caramel
and
some
berries
the
smell
was
sweeter
than
than
the
taste
again
this
beer
was
very
hotfusels
i
think
i
actually
detected
some
hop
bite
in
the
mouth
which
would
lose
it
points
with
bjcp
folks
but
again
this
is
a
product
of
its
age
not
the
true
potential
of
this
magnificent
beer
not
that
this
is
incredibly
surprising
to
any
one
but
buy
this
and
try
after
a
year
or
more
otherwise
you
are
in
for
an
adoloescent
beer
experience
beer
brewed
in
07
cheers
very
drinkable
as
i
found
myself
wishing
i
had
more
at
the
end
the
11
3
abv
was
very
well
hidden
i
would
have
guessed
8
though
i
could
feel
it
at
the
end
the
best
beer
ive
had
in
a
long
time
and
certainly
in
the
top
5
or
so
alltime
a
classic
drinkability

this
one
is
defiantly
a
sipper
i
sat
on
this
bottle
for
awhile
until
i
finally
broke
down
well
worth
the
wait
though
highly
recommended
if
you
can
get
your
hands
on
one
or
several
of
these
words
cannot
begin
to
explain
this
beer
so
you
will
just
have
to
see
for
yourself
review
100
poured
into
chalice
pours
the
darkest
shade
of
brown
you
can
imagine
all
but
pure
black
thick
really
thick
offwhite
and
creamy
head
with
great
retention
and
lacing
the
overall
look
in
the
cup
is
amazing
smell
is
good
but
a
little
too
much
alcohol
in
it
but
i
guess
thats
to
be
expected
with
such
a
high
abv
also
some
chocoalte
roasted
grain
raisin
and
touch
of
rum
in
the
smell
taste
is
wonderfully
complex
tingles
at
first
and
then
lead
to
a
nice
caramel
and
chocolate
taste
on
the
tounge
and
leaves
a
raisin
like
warming
sensation
as
it
goes
down
the
first
sip
was
amazing
i
must
say
as
it
warms
i
started
noticing
more
alcohol
and
some
sweet
sugar
i
would
say
mouthfeel
is
medium
with
a
nice
aftertaste
and
somewhat
thick
presence
left
behind
drinkability
i
can
only
give
a
3
5
due
to
the
cost
and
high
abv
overall
a
tremendous
beer
while
not
my
highest
rated
beer
of
the
first
100
its
probably
in
the
top
10
just
as
it
is
in
the
top
100
list
enjoy
this
beer
slowly
overall
a
very
fine
beer
with
lots
of
complexity
and
nice
balance
first
off
take
your
bottle
and
roll
it
on
your
table
gently
so
the
yeast
that
settled
on
the
bottom
of
the
bottle
lifts
off
the
bottom
and
intrudes
the
rest
of
the
bottle
pours
a
nice
brownishred
with
a
massive
amount
of
yeast
awesome
smell
is
fruity
like
cherries
and
other
dark
fruits
taste
is
definately
almost
a
wine
class
is
close
to
a
barleywine
in
my
opinion
very
sweet
though
with
little
to
no
noticeable
hops
to
finish
off
the
palate
a
very
different
type
than
im
used
to
but
i
very
much
appreciate
the
craftsmanship
put
into
this
superb
brew
very
pleasant
and
light
a
very
drinkable
but
sipper
of
a
brew
elegance
at
its
best
i
let
this
one
age
in
the
bottle
for
about
a
month
i
read
somewhere
that
the
monastery
that
produces
this
fine
beverage
puts
it
in
the
bottle
right
after
fermentation
so
i
didnt
want
to
review
it
being
so
green
the
beer
poured
into
my
chimay
goblet
had
a
dense
dark
brown
color
the
head
that
sat
atop
the
brew
was
a
soft
pillowy
white
the
aroma
had
a
lot
of
fruity
esters
resembling
raisins
there
was
a
slight
hint
of
sour
in
the
aroma
as
well
the
scent
of
toasted
grains
comes
through
nicely
the
alcohol
was
definitely
present
in
the
aroma
but
it
had
a
sweet
belgian
candi
sugar
quality
that
made
it
pleasant
there
was
no
hop
aroma
the
flavor
was
a
very
intense
maltiness
the
flavor
of
dark
dried
fruits
was
barely
present
there
was
a
great
alcohol
warmth
with
every
sip
coupled
with
the
carbonation
giving
the
beer
a
great
mouthfeel
there
were
really
no
hop
flavors
that
i
could
detect
the
beer
finished
very
dry
leaving
a
breadlike
feel
in
your
mouth
this
was
a
very
very
good
beer
as
to
be
expected
from
the
trappists
my
only
suggestion
would
be
to
age
this
beer
longer
two
or
more
years
perhaps
d
too
strong
to
have
many
of
but
very
enjoyable
by
the
bottle
or
even
two
this
beer
is
a
gem
it
pours
dark
brown
with
lots
of
yeast
the
nose
is
very
spicy
almost
vinous
and
with
dark
fruits
the
taste
is
of
dark
dried
fruit
with
an
intense
abbey
taste
great
sugary
residue
on
the
finish
refreshing
and
smooth
this
is
a
belgian
classic
i
would
love
it
if
it
were
just
a
bit
cheaper
the
8
is
also
fantastic
maybe
better
man
i
love
these
monks
and
their
eat
off
the
floor
clean
brewery
mediumfull
in
body
incredibly
smooth
and
so
creamy
very
luscious
mouthfeel
way
to
drinkable
for
a
sip
and
savor
beer
this
will
knock
you
down
before
you
know
it
excellent
overall
very
complex
and
well
balanced
one
it
is
too
alcoholic
for
my
taste
i
am
going
to
be
honest
here
i
really
tried
to
find
all
the
little
nuances
in
the
rochefort
10
and
i
feel
like
i
did
a
good
job
but
i
cant
with
a
good
conscience
rate
it
that
high
there
is
something
in
the
back
of
my
mind
that
is
telling
me
it
needed
a
gentle
touch
more
maltinesssweetness
to
tie
everything
together
dont
get
me
wrong
to
this
point
this
is
my
most
highly
rated
beer
but
i
still
think
it
needs
more
every
time
ive
had
this
brew
ive
put
it
up
against
another
quad
or
4
but
every
time
ive
found
things
i
really
appreciate
about
the
other
quads
that
the
10
just
does
not
have
but
still
tonight
i
am
reviewing
my
highest
rated
beer
to
date
11
3
will
get
you
stupid
but
other
than
that
this
beer
sits
perfectly
on
your
stomach
sip
and
savor
this
is
one
of
those
rare
beer
experiences
that
really
lives
up
to
expectations
this
one
completely
blew
me
away
what
a
great
beer
cant
wait
to
get
some
more
and
try
at
different
ages
really
a
well
made
drink
in
every
form
a
great
beer
one
of
the
best
most
complex
and
interesting
beers
i
have
had
buy
this
beer
just
to
smell
it
and
the
taste
isnt
bad
either
amazingly
full
body
real
thick
in
the
glass
and
in
the
mouth
one
of
the
closest
things
to
perfect
that
i
have
had
this
is
a
beers
beer
pours
an
opaque
dark
tea
color
with
a
huge
stiff
off
tan
head
that
resists
fading
in
rocky
patterns
and
leaves
3d
lacing
in
its
wake
the
smell
is
nice
earthy
belgian
yeast
and
dark
fruits
nicely
carbonated
the
tiny
bubbles
of
effervescence
lend
a
creamy
texture
to
the
mouth
feel
full
bodied
with
a
tingle
of
alcohol
that
adds
nicely
to
the
complexity
the
11
3
is
well
integrated
the
earthy
malt
raison
and
yeast
flavors
are
more
subtle
than
you
would
expect
from
a
beverage
with
such
a
high
abv
highly
recommended
d
i
really
enjoy
this
brew
but
with
11
2
alcohol
if
i
drank
this
all
night
it
would
be
a
short
night
nice
complexity
of
flavor
i
have
not
yet
tasted
a
better
balance
augmented
by
such
complex
aromas
and
will
have
to
revise
my
review
of
chimay
blue
which
i
really
like
a
lot
this
is
better
wow
is
probably
the
best
word
to
describe
this
poured
this
from
a
brown
bottle
into
my
tulip
glass
looks
a
lot
like
cola
though
has
a
thin
head
that
dissipates
but
leaves
marks
on
top
that
look
like
cirrus
clouds
quite
beautiful
to
watch
actually
smells
dreamy
of
sugars
fruits
spices
absolutely
wonderful
however
the
smell
was
just
a
warm
up
for
the
taste
that
followed
delicious
mediterranean
fruits
such
as
plums
figs
and
raisins
make
appearances
not
a
trace
of
bitterness
was
absolutely
perfect
paired
with
bleu
cheese
one
of
the
most
rewarding
experiences
ive
had
in

this
again

oz
bottle
into
a
chimay
chalice
poured
a
dark
brown
with
a
2
inch
head
left
very
little
lacing
aroma
is
of
figs
vanilla
and
other
dark
fruits
taste
is
figs
and
candied
fruits
sweetness
is
a
bit
sugary
at
the
tail
of
the
taste
also
there
is
a
bit
of
an
alcohol
kick
mouthfeel
is
medium
bodied
with
such
a
high
abv
it
can
definitely
catch
up
with
you
pretty
quickly
bottom
line
ive
spent
some
time
in
belgium
and
this
is
my
least
favorite
quad
i
greatly
respect
the
brewers
but
i
disagree
with
the
high
marks
of
this
one
i
might
be
the
only
one
pours
like
cocacola
into
a
glass
has
about
18
inch
of
head
that
quickly
dissipates
the
smell
is
average
for
quads
vanilla
hint
of
cocacola
yep
im
crazy
and
figs
the
taste
is
heavy
for
a
quad
definitely
not
on
the
sweet
side
vanilla
some
nuts
and
then
a
heavy
alcohol
finish
mouthfeel
is
great
feels
like
heavy
cream
this
is
a
very
drinkable
beer
pours
a
murky
cola
brown
cloudy
a
good
size
light
tan
head
recedes
slowly
aroma
is
large
dose
of
caramel
malt
sweetness
some
raisins
apples
and
alcohol
soaked
sponge
cake
hints
of
chocolate
and
ginger
are
evident
in
the
aroma
as
well
taste
follows
with
a
nice
chocolate
vanilla
and
caramel
nutty
dessert
bread
flavor
nice
and
yeasty
some
apple
flavor
before
a
biting
alcohol
warms
and
drys
the
throat
in
the
finish
mouthfeel
is
medium
in
body
a
peppery
effervescence
of
carbonation
tingles
on
the
tongue
and
builds
to
a
foam
in
the
mouth
definitely
one
of
the
best
quads
ive
tasted
perhaps
not
my
personal
top
but
right
up
there
alcohol
comes
on
strong
at
first
but
gradually
the
bite
dulls
nice
and
dry
very
enjoyable
poured
from
33cl
brown
bottle
into
a
westmalle
chalice
poured
a
murky
blood
brown
with
little
particles
of
yeast
that
escaped
the
bottle
smell
of
dried
fruit
mixed
with
a
sweet
malty
aroma
thats
carmel
bread
taste
of
raisins
cherries
some
candi
sugar
and
a
alcohol
finish
that
was
almost
ethereal
while
the
flavors
are
bold
and
refined
they
still
cannot
make
11
3
abv
not
get
you
hammered
pretty
quickly
this
beer
is
excellent
as
a
standalone
experience
and
i
am
sure
that
it
will
standup
to
just
about
any
flavor
you
decide
to
pair
with
it
overall
this
is
a
very
good
quad
tasted
side
by
side
with
a
westy
and
definately
liked
the
westy
better
that
said
this
is
a
great
beer
and
easier
to
get
overall
this
is
a
quality
product
the
taste
profile
is
very
complex
and
i
am
certain
that
i
would
pick
up
some
different
flavors
if
i
tried
it
again
trying
it
again
is
a
must
for
me
d
drinkability
is
fantastic
for
a
beer
of
such
power
and
complexity
even
at
11
3
alcohol
it
carries
great
finesse
and
i
cant
wait
to
take
another
sip
a
very
expensive
beer
and
kind
of
hard
to
find
here
in
late
2007
but
a
great
buy
for
an
occasional
treat
it
would
make
a
great
nightcap
as
well
due
to
its
warming
power
all
and
all
a
fantastic
beer
d

tasting
the
6
8
and
10
back
to
back
the
10
is
my
favorite
and
does
not
taste
as
boozy
as
the
8
for
the
bigger
abv
d
if
this
wasnt
8
99
for
a
11
2
oz
bottle
i
could
drink
this
with
freakish
regularity
my
gf
said
she
actually
preferred
the
8
but
i
disagree
the
10
is
the
apex
the
booze
is
there
but
hidden
very
carefully
there
is
a
reason
this
beer
is
ranked
so
high
one
of
the
best
out
there
cheers
i
am
often
amazed
at
the
huge
head
produced
by
belgium
brews
and
this
is
no
defferent
foamy
and
thick
at
3
tan
fingers
tall
body
is
a
perfect
dark
murky
brown
nose
is
huge
with
tones
of
sweet
malt
over
ripe
bananas
dark
zesty
fruit
and
spicey
pie
crust
at
first
sip
the
amazing
complexity
of
this
beer
just
explodes
on
the
tongue
with
a
wonderful
malty
zest
dark
fruit
and
rich
nuttiness
balances
well
together
spicey
feel
carries
this
beer
and
gels
well
with
the
even
consistant
sweetness
alchol
is
completly
well
hidden
a
belgium
classic
that
is
way
to
easy
to
drink
mouthfeel
keeps
with
the
zesty
spicey
sweet
feel
pours
a
murky
fig
like
brown
with
a
big
creamy
head
that
takes
forever
to
receed
to
a
thin
layer
huge
lacing
throughout
smells
of
pears
dried
fruit
fig
berries
and
a
hint
of
banana
the
multiple
flavors
in
the
scent
present
themselves
in
layers
throughout
the
sip
creamy
in
the
mouth
with
a
little
medicinal
finish
as
it
warms
the
nature
of
this
brew
is
a
sweet
sipper
but
the
abv
is
very
well
hidden
another
classic
monkbrew
drinkability
a
must
noble
and
elegant
beer
in
the
style
trappist
this
is
really
that
damn
good
the
monks
got
it
right
overall
i
found
this
beer
was
enjoyable
but
not
thrilling
it
was
of
good
quality
and
fun
to
try
but
i
wont
be
going
out
of
my
way
to
seek
it
out
again
cheers
i
had
mine
on
the
toilet
it
was
wonderful
pours
a
deep
burgundy
color
with
white
head
and
some
sediment
smell
is
full
of
malt
and
sweetness
the
taste
has
hints
of
fruit
malt
candy
with
a
hint
of
alcohol
although
it
is
well
hidden
mouth
feel
is
a
bit
creamy
truly
one
of
the
easiest
drinking
high
alcohol
beers
a
true
great
d
big
and
wonderful
could
take
several
in
a
night
pours
a
dark
muddy
brown
carmel
is
the
single
most
potent
part
of
the
nose
it
prepares
you
for
whats
next
fantastic
carmel
flavor
accented
with
a
wee
bit
of
chocolate
and
malty
hoppiness
a
little
heavy
but
fits
well
the
finish
is
just
great
without
overpowering
a
good
cheese
my
single
most
desired
beer
to
date
bottle
poured
dark
murky
brown
in
my
trappist
glass
it
gave
a
nice
tan
head
reduced
to
small
amount
of
lace
aromas
wonderfull
fruit
malts
and
alcohol
great
full
bodied
thick
mouthfeel
well
balanced
flavors
of
fruits
and
spice
this
ale
hides
it
alcohol
well
i
will
have
to
dink
this
one
again
drinkability
is
great
for
a
quadrupel
these
brews
are
usually
very
high
on
alcoholic
bite
but
this
one
provides
a
presence
of
alcohol
while
keeping
it
mild
and
subtle
very
well
crafted
brew
cheers
the
taste
mouthfeel
and
drinkability
ate
superb
notes
of
plums
and
other
fruits
mild
spicing
and
a
warming
alcohol
that
hides
it
self
well
i
am
glad
to
say
i
have
one
more
but
for
how
long
ive
had
a
chance
to
sample
a
few
more
bottles
of
this
since
my
initial
review
really
enjoy
this
brew
wish
it
was
just
a
bit
cheaper
drinkability
is
pretty
low
not
to
knock
the
beer
but
its
incredibly
rich
strong
and
generally
expensive
and
hard
to
find
your
just
not
going
to
want
to
sit
down
and
drink
more
then
one
or
two
of
these
in
a
sitting
in
fact
i
find
myself
really
slowing
down
with
this
last
13
with
the
booze
and
astringency
leaving
a
lingering
harshness
on
the
tongue
and
all
the
way
down
the
throat
particularly
tickling
my
uvula
damn
i
need
to
get
back
to
amsterdam
overall
this
finished
ahead
of
the
rest
slightly
above
the
westy12
abt
12
and
chimay
blue
the
aroma
and
flavors
were
a
little
stronger
in
this
one
another
truely
a
worldclass
beer
as
were
the
others
ive
had
this
with
just
the
abt
12
before
and
the
abt
was
better
but
in
this
case
this
bottle
was
better
youll
have
to
see
for
you
self
you
wont
be
disappointed
d
this
is
overall
a
decent
beer
great
complexity
and
mouthfeel
but
it
isnt
amazing
like
i
thought
it
would
be
i
do
like
it
but
it
is
not
one
of
my
favorite
brews
and
i
was
slightly
disappointed
by
this
the
big
alcohol
presence
makes
the
drinkability
average
this
is
borderline
barleywine
i
would
have
this
one
again
but
i
am
not
in
love
with
it
drinkability
this
is
also
a
fantastic
brew
like
the
8
that
can
be
enjoyed
at
anytime
its
so
super
drinkable
it
almost
sucks
that
its
over
11
i
think
between
the
8
and
the
10
i
like
the
8
slightly
more
it
seems
to
have
a
bit
more
balance
and
is
goes
down
a
tad
easier
which
is
saying
a
lot
they
are
both
great
beers
and
must
be
tried
i
can
see
why
this
bad
boy
is
currently
7
on
the
best
of
ba
d
this
beer
is
strong
im
half
way
through
an
eleven
ounce
bottle
and
my
face
is
warm
and
i
have
a
bit
of
buzz
but
this
is
a
really
good
beer
and
as
it
warms
a
few
more
flavors
arrive
a
good
beer
to
sip
on
d
this
beer
is
fairly
easy
to
come
across
for
a
trappist
beer
and
is
a
wonderful
substitute
for
westvleteren
12
so
id
snatch
up
as
many
of
these
as
you
can
very
drinkable
with
most
sit
down
meals
i
dont
know
how
successful
i
will
be
in
ageing
these
i
think
i
prefer
st
bernardus
12
though
wow
what
a
pour
this
beer
doesnt
look
like
it
wants
to
be
in
my
glass
the
huge
billowing
head
rises
four
fingers
above
the
cloudy
mahogany
colored
liquid
and
that
head
isnt
going
anywhere
any
time
soon
the
smell
is
wonderfully
complex
dominated
by
dark
fruit
from
plums
to
raisins
followed
by
more
light
fruit
and
pulled
together
by
some
phenols
and
alcohol
spice
the
taste
is
upfront
prickly
alcohol
and
peppery
spice
maybe
a
bit
of
hops
but
it
seems
to
be
mainly
the
alcohol
incredibly
warming
but
not
hot
hidden
beneath
the
alcohol
is
an
incredibly
full
maltiness
which
suggests
of
dark
bread
the
fruit
stays
in
there
but
it
isnt
as
noticeable
as
it
is
in
the
nose
overall
the
flavor
is
amazingly
vinous
on
taste
i
would
take
this
over
that
100
bottle
of
wine
any
day
the
warming
tingly
yet
deliciously
smooth
mouthfeel
is
pretty
wild
not
too
light
not
too
heavy
just
dead
on
ok
its
not
a
session
beer
but
damn
this
is
a
treat
worth
every
cent
let
me
admit
that
i
was
a
bit
skeptical
about
this
beers
very
high
rating
and
wondered
how
much
of
it
was
hype
let
me
tell
you
that
after
drinking
one
myself
ive
become
a
true
believer
rochefort
10
is
the
real
deal
give
it
a
try
and
you
wont
be
disappointed
enjoyed
out
of
my
tripel
karmeliet
tulip
glass
pours
a
deep
chestnut
brown
slightly
hazy
with
a
rocky
2
finger
head
head
is
a
creamy
tan
brown
short
lasting
and
fizzy
with
lots
of
lacing
aroma
is
strong
roasted
malts
with
a
definite
alcohol
presence
lots
of
raisins
tastes
very
malty
with
hints
of
caramel
and
vanilla
lots
of
roasted
malts
with
a
nice
balance
of
hoppy
bitterness
hops
are
not
overpowering
at
all
very
subdued
mouthfeel
is
very
smooth
with
a
pleasant
carbonated
bite
not
heavy
on
the
tongue
overall
an
excellent
beer
i
can
easily
enjoy
2
of
these
brews
but
due
to
the
high
alcohol
and
high
price
i
cant
take
much
more
than
that
m
creamy
rich
full
perfect
pours
a
deep
dark
burnt
sienna
with
a
light
brown
highlights
and
a
solid
three
fingers
of
tan
head
with
some
brown
spots
on
the
fairly
bit
bubbles
head
ends
up
with
a
finger
of
thick
froth
lots
of
chunks
floating
around
in
there
looks
excellent
nose
of
strong
dried
fruit
spices
molasses
lots
of
cookies
very
light
hoppy
grapefruit
incredible
flavor
first
cookies
and
chocolate
like
the
nose
spicy
alcohol
in
the
middle
almost
no
hop
character
strong
raisins
cranberries
and
other
dried
fruit
in
the
middle
alcohol
comes
back
through
the
nose
after
a
little
bit
fulll
creamy
body
amazing
only
topped
by
the
8
this
ones
amazing
with
the
only
slight
problem
being
the
light
alcohol
presence
throughout
the
beer
kind
of
tough
to
hide
a
full
11
abv
so
i
wont
fault
them
much
delicious
pours
a
deep
dark
cola
brown
color
very
light
tan
head
medium
head
retention
mild
aroma
slightly
oakey
and
sweet
a
hint
of
non
citrus
fruityness
flavor
is
somewhat
oakey
with
a
belgian
sour
mouthfeel
is
slightly
fizzy
light
to
medium
body
very
lightly
drying
drinkability
is
high
good
flavor
decent
mouthfeel
certainly
wouldnt
mind
another
one
after
this
if
i
had
had
the
foresight
to
pick
up
a
2nd
bottle
argh
overall
sad
as
it
may
sound
this
beer
is
pretty
similar
to
st
bernardus
abt
12
but
the
sugar
in
abt
12
gives
it
a
great
caramel
character
that
the
rochefort
is
lacking
this
is
the
only
reason
why
i
prefer
abt
12
however
this
is
still
a
musttry
beer
and
i
certainly
do
not
regret
dishing
out
10
australian
for
the
one
bottle
notes
fwiw
i
paid
5
99
for
the
bottle
i
refrigerated
it
a
couple
months
ago
to
hoist
in
celebration
of
a
new
job
i
began
in
july
finally
got
a
chance
to
enjoy
it
last
night
so
i
hoisted
this
topnotch
belgian
in
celebration
of
my
new
job
as
well
as
in
the
memory
of
michael
jackson
a
beer
certainly
worthy
of
toasting
with
i
was
real
excited
to
try
this
one
i
was
a
bit
disappointed
this
just
was
too
alcoholic
for
me
it
was
good
but
was
it
7
good
im
not
so
sure
dark
chestnut
brown
color
and
a
fizzy
beige
soda
pop
like
head
that
reduces
quickly
but
does
keep
a
thick
ring
and
surface
layer
the
nose
displays
wonderful
aromas
of
dark
fruits
of
raison
and
berries
firm
malty
carob
base
and
banana
the
first
sip
reveals
some
roasted
malts
and
earthiness
up
front
and
ending
with
a
hoppy
bitterness
and
citric
balance
burnt
brown
sugar
sweetness
anise
nutty
malts
and
aspartame
shows
up
as
it
warms
the
finish
is
long
with
notes
of
chary
hazelnut
nutty
malt
and
faint
espresso
the
alcohol
burn
is
moderate
for
a
11
3
but
this
would
make
it
a
gem
after
some
aging
good
crisp
carbonation
with
a
thin
mouthfeel
that
is
really
good
but
was
hoping
for
something
a
little
chewier
pours
a
dark
opaque
brown
with
a
tan
head
aromas
of
a
malty
sweetness
alcohol
and
a
coffee
molasses
presence
in
the
taste
a
malty
alcohol
flavor
and
molasses
charicteristic
also
a
dry
end
a
sweet
alcoholic
mouthfeel
and
a
sweet
molasses
aftertaste
even
though
alcohol
is
there
it
hides
it
well
and
great
flavors
overall
drinkability
is
good
slightly
warm
but
very
nice
mostly
balanced
good
stuff
d
this
beer
is
one
to
savor
and
share
the
overall
impression
is
of
a
heavy
flavorfull
cigar
like
beer
i
was
surprised
that
it
retained
so
much
carbonation
after
2
5
years
it
was
starting
to
get
a
bit
autolyzed
so
i
dont
think
i
would
age
it
any
longer
than
this
drinkability

this
defines
creamy
belgian
ale

its
just
beautiful
to
hold
in
the
mouth
and
the
flavors
will
keep
you
busy
all
night
long
what
a
treat
overall
a
stunning
force
of
brewing
nature
this
one
is
like
a
deep
and
wide
river
quiet
and
still
on
the
surface
yet
powerful
and
tumultuous
underneath
this
beer
is
holy
d
one
of
the
worlds
best
with
good
reason
wow
the
drinkability
is
quite
nice
the
11
3
abv
is
melded
nicely
with
the
taste
if
there
exists
on
earth
a
finer
beer
im
not
sure
my
heart
could
handle
it
by
my
best
reckoning
this
is
absolutely
perfect
still
wow
poured
slowly
into
a
tulip
glass
and
it
almost
overflowed
with
head
from
the
11
2
oz
bottle
very
dark
brown
with
active
carbonation
and
thick
bubbly
offwhite
head
that
leaves
nearly
continuous
lace
up
the
glass
as
the
head
slowly
dissipated
smells
of
roasted
malts
and
straw
with
a
slightly
alcoholic
nose
sweet
grainy
malt
if
with
longlived
slightly
sweet
aftertaste
that
picks
up
some
bitterness
with
time
full
bodied
with
slightly
dry
texture
a
little
fizzy
and
clearly
alcoholic
finish
this
is
a
tasty
beer
that
is
not
as
amazing
as
i
was
expecting
considering
the
high
cost
of
a
small
bottle
the
flavor
is
not
terribly
complex
compared
to
some
others
that
i
have
tried
in
this
style
the
alcohol
really
comes
through
in
the
smell
flavor
and
finish
to
the
point
of
being
a
little
too
dominant
drinkability
this
is
simply
a
amazing
drink
that
one
could
surely
enjoy
but
the
high
alcohol
amount
makes
it
hard
to
have
to
many
in
a
night
but
damn
if
you
wouldnt
try
this
is
the
best
quad
and
one
of
the
best
beers
i
have
had
the
pleasure
of
drinking
thus
far
this
is
worth
seeking
out
even
if
you
have
to
cross
state
lines
in
order
to
find
it
an
incredible
brew
overall
its
a
good
sipping
beer
i
prefer
the
rochefort
8
though
having
had
and
loved
both
this
and
the
rochefort
8
i
am
left
wondering
just
how
good
the
rochefort
6
must
be
d
excellent
brew
and
fairly
drinkable
the
11
3
alcohol
by
volume
certainly
makes
it
much
less
drinkable
than
session
brews
but
for
higher
alcohol
beer
it
is
pretty
easy
to
drink
other
than
the
fact
that
the
alcohol
doesnt
seem
to
be
masked
very
well
eric
overall
awesome
beer
next
to
a
westy
this
is
my
favorite
beer
in
terms
of
cost
per
unit
of
enjoyment
it
out
ranks
even
a
westy
i
keep
it
stocked
for
nights
when
i
want
to
transport
back
to
a
cool
spring
evening
in
belgium
or
overcome
the
pits
and
pratfalls
of
living
in
a
country
that
cant
produce
beer
anywhere
near
as
well
as
a
gaggle
of
trappist
monks
in
a
land
far
away
overall
one
amazing
brew
if
this
isnt
my
favorite
it
is
in
my
top
three
without
a
doubt
highly
recommended
this
is
the
best
beer
that
ive
ever
had
i
just
wish
i
had
a
bigger
bottle
poured
a
dark
brown
with
hints
of
ruby
in
the
light
huge
head
turns
into
a
nice
foam
with
a
little
lace
not
as
musty
or
strong
a
smell
as
i
was
expecting
but
gorgeous
nontheless
sweet
bread
chocolate
cherries
booze
dried
fruit
to
me
it
tastes
like
an
ice
cream
sundae
made
with
booze
and
a
cherry
on
top
silky
mouthfeel
nice
carbonation
pleasure
drink
dheavy
freaking
duty
but
so
good
i
get
the
impression
that
more
than
one
of
these
could
really
put
a
hurting
on
you
but
i
think
i
would
be
willing
to
try
this
is
probably
the
best
beer
i
have
ever
had
i
am
totally
impressed
tasted
with
bernardus
abt
12
it
pours
medium
dark
brown
with
moderate
head
not
as
fullbodied
as
the
bernardus
it
has
darker
roasted
nut
aromas
and
a
more
crisp
finish
the
flavors
are
more
intense
with
walnut
and
raisin
flavors
the
finish
is
long
with
and
elegance
that
makes
it
imminently
drinkable
d
wasnt
sure
what
to
expect
as
ive
tried
the
6
and
8
but
didnt
want
to
hold
the
10
to
any
unwarranted
hype
or
scrutiny
overall
a
very
tasty
belgian
quad
and
a
good
choice
when
in
the
mood
for
a
sweet
and
malty
option
that
has
a
kick
of
complexity
overall
tasty
and
enjoyable
i
have
had
the
pleasure
to
enjoy
bottles
i
purchased
in
the
us
and
belgium
while
it
is
common
to
cellar
this
big
belgian
brew
i
must
say
that
the
fresher
belgium
bought
counterpart
is
superior
as
it
lacks
the
oxidation
that
i
feel
detracts
from
the
rich
flavors
of
the
quadruple
wherever
you
buy
it
from
it
pours
a
dark
mahogany
with
a
hint
of
ruby
on
the
edges
the
head
is
not
exactly
consistent
with
some
i
have
dissipating
quickly
while
others
lingering
for
a
whileeither
way
it
is
a
slightly
dark
tan
this
is
one
of
those
rare
brews
that
show
the
best
of
beer
can
hold
its
own
against
the
complexities
of
fine
wine
you
will
certainly
notice
the
strong
molasses
sugar
notes
from
the
candy
sugars
used
in
brewing
plums
black
cherry
leather
raisins
and
hints
of
roasted
malts
play
on
the
tongue
the
alcohol
will
not
miss
the
senses
as
its
flavor
blends
into
the
overall
character
and
leaves
the
mouth
and
throat
warm
without
burning
in
a
pleasant
balance
that
lets
you
know
you
are
drinking
something
substantial
and
brewed
with
the
alcohol
balance
only
mastery
of
brewing
accomplishes
off
white
fluffy
head
and
one
finger
worth
of
it
deep
red
body
i
smell
nuts
and
some
dark
fruits
the
first
taste
is
very
nutty
and
sorda
fruity
and
the
carbonation
is
very
attacking
points
come
off
for
that
almost
like
soda
carbonation
creamy
head
that
falls
to
a
huge
patch
in
the
center
of
my
goblet
nice
lacing
left
on
the
sides
of
my
glass
this
beer
taste
amazing
the
booze
is
starting
to
take
over
im
glad
i
dont
get
a
chance
to
try
an
amazing
beer
like
this
all
the
time
cause
it
would
ruin
the
fun
of
drinking
this
kind
of
special
beer
you
can
taste
the
booze
in
thisbeing
11
abv
i
would
think
it
would
be
evident
i
wanna
drink
all
of
this
quick
but
im
pacing
myselfits
amazing
could
the
nut
taste
be
the
yeast
if
notit
really
adds
character
to
this
beer
did
i
mention
this
beer
is
amazing
haha
i
reccomend
everyone
to
try
this
beer
thank
you
monks
for
this
awesome
monk
juice
overall
this
was
the
most
memorable
beer
i
drank
on
my
trip
to
europe
definately
the
most
flavourful
out
of
the
trappists
i
got
to
try56
breweries
aint
bad
dangit
westveletren
drinkability
im
not
real
big
on
beliums
so
i
wont
dog
this
but
it
aint
for
me
if
your
into
belgians
definately
try
it
no
doubting
this
is
an
excellent
quadrupel
but
i
did
not
enjoy
this
as
much
as
i
have
before
perhaps
because
i
drank
it
a
little
to
quickly
and
should
have
paid
more
respect
it
was
far
more
enjoyable
once
i
got
out
some
blue
vein
cheese
to
go
with
it
probably
the
best
beer
i
have
yet
to
sample
would
have
scored
higher
were
it
not
so
alcoholic
this
beers
redbrown
color
was
rather
appealing
and
was
accompanied
by
a
light
sour
and
dried
black
cherry
aroma
this
beer
was
a
fairly
ideal
blend
of
grapey
character
and
dark
dry
roastiness
this
beer
finishes
dry
and
clean
in
the
mouth
although
it
is
a
bit
boozy
very
good
pours
from
a
bottle
a
murky
dark
brown
and
leaves
a
few
yeast
particles
floating
around
with
a
thick
tan
head
that
clings
to
the
glass
the
aroma
is
dark
pitted
fruit
rum
raisin
candied
fruit
brown
sugar
spicy
bready
aroma
the
taste
starts
spicy
herbal
in
nature
a
bit
sour
dry
fruity
with
a
warming
alcohal
finish
overall
a
good
beer
but
not
worth
the
price
tag
of
712oz
bottle
bread
and
dark
fruit
dominate
the
aroma
raisins
and
plums
mostly
and
the
taste
presents
caramel
and
those
fruit
tones
and
fresh
bread
again
man
trappist
monks
have
got
it
down
rochefort
10
is
very
smooth
and
thick
almost
silky
as
i
sip
it
and
its
smoothness
grows
as
it
warms
to
room
temperature
i
would
love
to
sit
and
go
through
a
bunch
of
these
but
this
is
one
of
those
that
demands
more
respect
than
that
one
of
the
best
for
sure
but
not
to
be
overconsumed
awesome
awesome
beer
i
tried
this
beer
on
july
12
2007
at
the
beer
bistro
in
toronto
unfortunately
i
cant
rate
it
as
high
as
the
st
bernardus
abt
12
i
had
last
night
maybe
had
i
tried
them
in
the
reverse
order
things
may
have
been
different
anyway
this
poured
a
dark
reddishbrown
with
a
small
head
the
first
contrast
with
ss
the
head
disappeared
rather
quickly
the
aroma
was
very
similar
with
robust
bread
and
malt
tones
as
well
as
plums
it
felt
great
on
the
tongue
with
a
fullbodied
feel
as
for
the
taste
im
not
sure
where
it
failed
when
compared
to
the
sb
but
it
just
failed
to
measure
up
possibly
the
higher
alcohol
content
which
i
noticed
more
in
this
brew
it
feel
great
on
the
mouth
not
a
hard
taste
this
is
a
beer
to
be
enjoy
when
you
open
the
bottle
you
will
hope
it
will
never
endwill
be
great
with
salty
foodcheese
a
damn
solid
beer
all
the
way
around
it
is
strong
in
alcohol
prescence
but
not
overbearing
and
the
silky
mouthfeel
i
have
come
accustomed
to
in
belgian
ales
was
definitely
there
i
had
a
bottle
last
night
7507
and
it
was
just
as
good
as
the
first
time
i
tried
it
i
used
to
only
be
able
to
get
this
beer
when
i
went
home
to
the
bay
area
but
with
the
opening
of
the
bevmo
in
san
luis
obispo
i
have
plenty
of
access
to
this
beer
and
i
cant
wait
to
get
more
definitel
recommended
second
time
dipping
into
this
brew
remember
it
fondly
the
first
time
so
i
hope
it
stacks
up
to
memory
pours
a
deep
dark
brown
near
black
with
a
creamy
head
that
laces
the
glass
brown
sugar
is
the
most
dominant
aroma
with
hints
of
some
dark
fruits
like
raisins
and
a
bit
of
molasses
as
well
taste
is
semisweet
with
pear
plums
and
port
dominating
the
palate
also
a
little
black
cherry
its
a
complex
beer
that
goes
down
smooth
with
a
bit
of
alcohol
to
warm
you
but
not
as
much
as
you
would
expect
all
in
all
a
fantastic
brew
a
sipper
but
a
definite
treat
i
wouldnt
get
this
every
day
but
its
a
oneinawhile
brew
i
want
to
give
this
a
perfect
rating
so
badly
but
i
dont
think
i
will
ever
do
that
all
i
can
do
at
this
point
is
to
thank
god
for
creating
trappist
monks
and
for
allowing
them
to
share
with
us
a
taste
of
heaven
here
on
earth
d
this
beer
is
amazing
i
could
drink
this
beer
all
the
time
if
it
were
a
bit
cheaper
definitley
try
this
beer
if
you
havent
yet
the
difference
between
these
three
beers
is
marginal
at
best
once
again
god
bless
the
monks
and
enjoy
the
beer
if
you
are
lucky
enough
to
consume
any
on
the
list
above
you
have
been
anointed
a
very
good
trappist
fruity
sweet
but
not
too
sweet
with
a
hint
of
sourness
on
the
back
end
but
not
so
much
that
its
a
bad
thing
definitely
drinkable
if
i
see
this
one
sitting
on
a
shelf
ill
probably
pick
it
up
again
although
i
wouldnt
drive
across
town
to
get
it
from

rocheforts
would
be
a
thicker
body
and
maybe
a
tad
bit
of
sweetness
more
this
beer
is
exceptional
in
all
aspects
except
one
drinkability
because
of
the
11
3
abv
you
can
really
only
have
one
aside
from
that
this
beer
is
fantastic
an
excellent
example
of
a
strong
trappist
ale
in
my
area
its
so
expensive
at
around
8
per
11
2oz
bottle
that
its
only
a
rare
treat
but
one
that
everyone
should
have
at
least
once
final
thoughts
first
off
i
would
like
to
thank
god
and
the
monks
for
making
this
available
to
me
anytime
i
want
one
this
is
a
truly
fantastic
beer
that
has
monster
signature
flavors
and
aromas
that
are
sure
to
please
drinkability
one
of
the
best
beers
ive
had
in
a
while
and
fantastic
pairing
with
a
nice
peppery
steak
would
pick
up
again
d
overall
a
good
beer
but
it
is
not
all
that
i
thought
it
would
be
worth
a
try
silky
smooth
mouthfeel
that
is
some
how
light
and
airy
at
the
same
time
carbonation
is
perfect
for
the
style
complex
flavorful
and
extremly
digestable
this
is
a
top
notch
beer
that
every
beer
enthusiast
should
try
at
least
once
one
of
my
all
time
favorites
wonderfully
complex
both
in
the
aroma
and
in
the
taste
it
seems
to
change
a
little
bit
every
degree
it
warms
if
this
wasnt
so
costly
in
the
states
id
buy
it
by
the
case
the
high
abv
is
so
cleverly
hidden
it
sneaks
up
on
you
so
sip
this
one
and
savor
each
one
feels
creamy
on
the
mouth
and
not
as
heavy
as
you
would
expect
such
a
delightful
beer
definitely
not
one
you
would
want
to
drink
all
night
though
due
to
the
high
abv
the
appearance
was
a
typical
trappist
quad
muddy
brown
with
a
red
tint
the
aroma
held
hints
of
citrus
and
was
almost
milky
and
colalike
the
flavor
was
very
mellow
almost
like
a
sweet
old
ale
it
feels
creamier
than
the
bernardus
though
i
unfortunately
cant
compare
it
to
the
westlveteren
yet
theres
a
little
banana
with
the
subtle
fruit
malt
flavors
like
the
other
quads
this
isnt
the
boldest
beer
but
despite
the
alcohol
its
ohso
drinkable
if
you
can
afford
it
to
the
monks
of
abbaye
de
notredame
de
saintremy
bravo
d
it
is
pretty
darn
good
i
would
say
flavor
wise
it
is
in
between
a
westys
12
and
a
st
bernys
12
however
for
carbonation
it
leans
a
lot
more
towards
westy
12
very
good
beer
just
a
tad
bit
pricey
imo
i
like
this
the
more
i
get
into
it
at
first
i
was
slightly
disappointed
but
now
im
loving
the
beer
id
buy
this
again
id
like
to
age
it
a
few
years
to
see
how
things
pan
out
d
even
though
its
so
complex
its
so
good
that
its
highly
enjoyable
and
very
drinkable
if
there
is
anyplace
this
beer
is
lacking
it
is
in
appearance
it
looked
a
nice
brown
with
a
cream
1
finger
head
that
hung
aroundit
had
a
good
deal
of
what
looked
like
pulp
in
it
but
i
guess
those
are
yeast
flakes
never
really
noticed
them
in
any
beer
beforeanyway
those
made
me
not
want
to
give
it
a
higher
rating
for
appearance
then
the
perfection
started
the
smell
on
this
top
notch
smells
fruity
definitely
grapes
tastes
extremely
complex
there
must
be
10
different
fruits
but
it
took
me
a
long
time
with
many
sips
to
place
the
main
taste
i
think
it
is
figs
this
has
to
be
one
of
the
best
flavor
blends
i
have
ever
tasted
it
is
not
to
sweet
not
to
bitter
not
to
strong
not
to
light
this
beer
is
hoppy
and
has
a
good
amount
of
carbonation
and
gives
a
almost
tongue
numbing
effect
along
with
the
alcohol
heat
the
real
story
of
this
to
me
was
how
the
alcohol
on
this
one
goes
right
to
your
headeven
the
tiniest
1st
sip
and
you
can
feel
it
warm
up
your
head
like
a
shot
of
whiskey
would
never
felt
that
from
a
beer
before
not
even
a
imp
stout
or
barley
wines
with
higher
abvat
the
same
time
the
11
3
abv
doesnt
effect
the
drinkability
in
the
leastit
just
adds
heat
i
felt
no
bite
at
all
like
some
other
reviewers
saidmaybe
its
just
a
different
batch
drinks
more
like
a
5
or
6
i
would
say
super
drinkable
expense
is
the
only
reason
i
sipped
it
these
monks
know
their
stuff
the
beer
even
seemed
to
have
have
a
bit
of
jolly
blended
into
it
to
me
best
one
ive
tried
for
sure
wish
it
was
sold
by
the
case
instead
of
the
bottle
trappistes
rochefort
10
pours
a
deep
brown
with
a
thick
creamy
head
that
lingers
for
quite
a
while
aroma
is
ripe
fruit
chalky
yeast
and
sweet
malt
there
is
a
sweet
almost
flowery
characteristic
as
well
not
the
typical
floral
hop
aroma
taste
is
amazing
dark
fruit
esters
and
sweet
malts
the
finish
is
sharp
with
a
hop
bite
alcohol
is
present
quite
spicy
and
very
warming
there
is
a
strong
yeast
character
in
the
aftertaste
this
beer
is
so
complex
its
hard
to
pull
out
all
the
individual
flavors
a
bit
expensive
but
well
worth
the
experience
d
overall
this
is
truly
the
defination
of
a
huge
beer
this
was
really
a
big
sipper
and
i
struggled
my
way
through
it
it
was
very
good
and
massivly
complex
however
just
too
strong
and
hot
with
the
alcohol
to
truly
be
enjoyed
right
now
goes
down
a
little
rough
very
hoppy
but
an
overall
smoothness
to
it
that
is
not
supassed
by
anything
else
mouth
feel
is
strong
and
so
is
the
after
taste
definitely
not
a
start
out
beer
but
one
that
deserves
to
be
treated
with
respect
and
honor
overall
my
expectations
were
definitely
met
with
this
one
goes
down
as
a
great
belgian
drinkability
is
always
subjective
when
it
comes
to
such
strong
and
complex
beers
like
quadrupels
so
just
take
your
time
and
enjoy
every
little
detail
of
this
beer
md
not
great
i
like
strong
beers
but
not
a
fan
of
this
beer
to
be
honest
obviously
im
in
the
minority
so
give
it
a
try
to
see
what
you
think
maybe
belgians
just
arent
for
me
quite
a
decent
beer
but
you
have
to
be
ready
for
the
quite
strong
alcohol
taste
this
is
the
only
thing
that
would
put
me
off
drinking
this
on
a
semiregular
basis
pours
to
a
nice
strong
chocolate
milkshake
head
that
slowly
shrinks
but
never
disappears
the
color
is
very
dark
amber
with
a
bit
of
haze
aromas
of
banana
alcohol
and
caramel
come
through
with
a
light
undertone
of
brettomyces
culture
the
taste
comes
through
to
me
as
dark
whole
grain
toast
with
some
sweet
but
very
dark
rummolasses
notes
i
get
a
very
strong
yeasty
flavor
that
i
associate
with
homebrew
this
beer
is
very
dry
and
very
well
carbonated
it
will
linger
after
each
sip
and
reveal
new
sensations
for
what
it
is
it
is
very
well
crafted
but
i
find
it
a
bit
too
much
for
my
tastes
i
usually
try
to
keep
two
of
these
in
my
cellar
at
all
times
highly
recommended
a
classic
would
like
to
try
again
this
one
came
to
me
from
nathan15
in
the
bif
race
thanks
this
is
a
big
beer
its
well
balanced
and
when
poured
into
a
snifter
it
presents
a
huge
head
with
wonderful
lacing
dark
dark
redish
brown
colour
full
of
mollases
flavour
a
bit
of
spice
and
fruit
notes
with
a
delicate
hoptone
to
it
perfect
balance
of
carbonation
which
extends
to
the
pleasant
mouthfeel
of
this
beer
five
stars
for
sure
highly
recommended
chris
possibly
my
favorite
belgian
beer
if
you
havent
had
it
yet
what
are
you
waiting
for
the
monks
know
their
stuff
theres
no
doubt
about
that
im
incredibly
thankful
that
i
was
able
to
drink
this
tonight
especially
since
hearing
that
its
becoming
harder
and
harder
to
find
pours
a
thick
syrupy
dark
dark
dark
brown
almost
black
the
head
gets
up
to
14
inch
with
some
good
hard
pouring
towards
the
end
the
head
mostly
goes
away
but
the
lacing
stays
around
and
its
a
good
strong
lacing
the
smell
is
very
sweet
smelling
and
lots
of
dark
fruit
smell
the
mouthfeel
is
very
carbonated
and
the
alcohol
presence
is
noticeable
but
not
off
putting
flavors
of
candy
sugar
and
sweet
sweet
plum
greet
you
with
a
mediumfull
body
the
mouthfeel
is
still
smooth
overall
this
is
a
favorite
friend
of
mine
that
i
will
have
always
pulled
out
some
aged
danish
blue
none
of
them
came
close
to
overwhelming
this
quadrupel
very
impressive
brew
all
the
way
around
musttry
for
a
wide
demographic
of
beer
drinkers
the
mouthfeel
is
full
and
smooth
with
a
nice
bite
and
an
earthy
pulp
like
quality
than
makes
for
a
very
enjoyable
texture
its
hard
to
describe
just
how
good
this
beer
is
phenomenal
a
must
try
a
very
good
quad
i
could
be
able
to
drink
a
few
though
the
alcohol
will
get
me
nice
and
interesting
balance
i
was
quite
happy
to
come
across
this
one
poors
a
deep
cloudy
mahogany
with
very
little
light
passing
through
and
a
big
almost
soda
like
head
a
sweet
smell
with
spicy
and
banana
tones
a
very
complex
taste
that
i
cant
even
pretend
to
understand
with
a
pleasant
bite
of
alcohol
this
was
worth
the
6
i
paid
for
it
and
certainly
one
of
the
best
i
have
ever
had
the
easiest
of
the
trappist
beers
to
find
here
so
why
not
drink
one
thats
been
cellared
for
a
year
pours
a
deep
mahogany
color
with
solid
cream
lacing
more
brown
with
the
end
yeast
sediment
poured
in
the
glass
lots
of
plums
fruit
caramel
a
bit
hot
could
cellar
even
longer
to
mellow
out
with
no
problem
great
smell
as
it
warms
worth
the
five
bucks
no
doubt
the
beer
pours
a
rich
thick
luxurious
dark
brown
color
with
excellent
head
retention
and
fabulous
lacing
on
the
nose
oh
my
where
to
begin
chocalate
fudge
caramel
cherries
and
port
all
combine
with
belgium
spice
to
make
one
exotic
incredible
aroma
on
the
palate
mmm
so
rich
so
smooth
satin
and
silk
with
a
heavenly
mouthfeel
this
beer
is
pretty
sweet
but
is
not
the
least
bit
cloying
imo
the
flavors
replicate
the
nose
with
lots
of
cherries
caramel
and
chocolate
this
beer
is
very
rich
and
very
long
with
a
very
long
lingering
finish
this
beer
is
a
real
sipper
which
only
makes
sense
given
the
abv
which
is
well
disguised
you
would
never
guess
the
abv
is
that
high
however
its
so
rich
and
viscuous
theres
no
way
to
just
gulp
this
down
an
absolute
taste
treat
easily
one
of
the
5
best
beers
ive
ever
tried
delicious
im
afraid
a
lot
of
bas
are
like
me
they
search
thier
beer
stores
for
the
newest
and
latest
beers
and
leave
this
one
on
the
shelves
imo
this
was
a
mistake
my
favorite
trappist
beer
so
far
ya
cant
go
wrong
with
this
beer
and
if
you
enjoy
triplesquadrupel
consider
yourself
fortunate
any
time
you
find
it
for
sale
this
is
worldclass
for
sure
i
dont
seem
to
remember
the
alcohol
being
this
apparent
the
other
time
i
tried
it
perhaps
this
could
use
some
more
time
to
sit
pours
a
dark
fudgy
brown
color
with
a
khaki
head
that
leaves
lots
of
lacing
on
the
glass
and
maintains
itself
in
a
thin
cover
over
the
liquid
smells
very
rich
chocolate
that
familiar
rochefort
yeast
and
raw
alcohol
some
faint
fruit
notes
in
the
vein
of
figs
or
dates
on
the
palate
rich
malty
mocha
notes
overlaid
with
figgy
fruits
phenols
and
spice
the
flavors
are
huge
refined
and
are
lent
a
boozy
intensity
by
the
raw
alcohol
that
comes
out
in
the
midpalate
and
burns
through
the
finish
mouthfeel
is
very
full
with
alcohol
carbonation
and
smooth
malts
that
are
a
huge
step
up
in
thickness
from
the
rochefort
6
and
8
overall
this
is
a
phenomenal
beer
all
the
different
elements
are
in
balance
and
all
those
elements
are
compelling
in
and
of
themselves
even
aspects
of
the
beer
that
are
normally
detractions
like
the
raw
alcohol
note
contribute
here
positively
to
the
overall
experience
wow
what
a
beer
the
drinkability
is
excellent
this
beer
is
so
smooth
and
easy
to
drink
it
would
be
easy
to
drink
tons
of
this
the
appearance
is
a
nice
brown
red
color
not
much
in
the
way
of
head
sweet
in
the
nose
with
some
spice
and
maybe
some
figfruit
lots
of
plum
with
an
alcohol
burn
at
the
finish
i
like
the
beer
but
i
think
it
can
be
better
i
will
try
it
again
but
put
some
more
age
on
it
dont
share
this
one
and
dont
drink
it
fast
overall
certainly
a
good
beer
and
one
of
the
better
quadrupels
i
have
had
very
smooth
and
easy
to
drink
for
the
11
3
ac
that
said
im
not
overly
impress
with
this
brew
i
think
the
ridiculously
high
rating
is
a
bit
much
and
there
are
a
lot
more
beers
i
would
put
ahead
of
it
perhaps
i
just
havent
tasted
enough
beers
served
in
a
chalice
this
beer
pours
a
well
carbonated
head
with
a
pretty
mahogany
color
topped
by
a
latte
colored
foam
aroma
is
fairly
fruity
taste
is
very
interesting
fruity
raisins
but
drier
and
slightly
hoppier
than
expected
the
strong
alcohol
creeps
through
warming
the
palate
a
good
example
of
the
style
drinkability
it
certainly
has
a
story
to
tell
as
far
as
the
flavor
profile
is
concerned
i
could
sip
this
thing
all
night
and
discover
nuance
after
nuance
of
course
after
two
of
these
id
also
be
discovering
quite
a
loose
tongue
poured
from
a
33cl
bottle
that
i
shipped
back
from
denver
since
they
left
the
texas
market
label
had
a
best
by
date
in
2011
it
was
a
cloudy
dark
brown
with
reddish
tunes
the
head
was
small
but
a
constant
carb
stream
kept
a
foam
in
the
center
throughout
the
smell
was
heavy
on
plums
and
raisins
i
saw
someone
describe
it
as
portlike
and
would
tend
to
agree
was
very
sweet
smelling
and
you
could
get
hints
of
the
abv
the
taste
was
also
very
sweet
from
start
to
finish
with
a
little
bitter
at
the
end
to
tone
down
the
sweet
the
alcohol
definitely
comes
thru
in
the
taste
but
isnt
too
overpowering
overall
it
has
a
good
taste
and
a
33cl
bottle
is
more
than
enough
anything
more
than
that
and
i
know
the
sweetness
and
high
abv
would
get
to
more
pretty
warm
feeling
as
it
is
highly
recommend
you
try
it
i
can
see
this
as
an
annual
treat
for
me
4
rb
t
y
purchased
this
brew
in
indianapolis
a
year
ago
and
forgot
i
put
it
in
my
cellar
boy
am
i
glad
i
found
this
gem
poured
muddy
brown
with
a
tan
head
the
head
was
foamy
and
floating
with
yeast
sediment
great
retention
and
sticky
lacing
left
on
glass
taste
as
it
smells
starts
sweet
bold
and
rich
in
malt
dried
fruit
such
as
plums
prunes
and
raisins
molasses
and
a
strange
hint
of
tobacco
copenhagen
in
the
medium
finishing
off
with
a
bitter
coffee
scent
and
strong
alcohol
bite
nice
medium
body
with
a
creamy
feel
and
lively
carbonated
that
make
easy
to
consume
overall
i
enjoyed
this
brew
alot
despite
the
tobacco
scent
and
taste
enjoy
taste
is
of
sweet
malty
notes
and
fruit
with
a
touch
of
banana
bread
the
feel
is
smooth
and
subtle
you
wouldnt
know
this
thing
has
an
11
3
abv
without
looking
an
alcoholic
note
does
pull
through
on
the
aftertaste
as
it
warms
however
and
it
complements
the
taste
i
could
drink
this
all
day
if
my
wallet
was
thick
enough
hands
down
a
fantastic
beer
the
alcohol
warms
the
tongue
and
otherwise
this
is
a
creamy
and
easy
to
sip
beer
not
too
heavilybodied
but
definitely
not
too
light
either
all
around
a
wonderful
beverage
and
one
i
cant
wait
to
try
again
served
at
cellar
temperature
in
a
snifter
poured
a
deep
brownish
color
with
a
little
bit
of
floaties
about
two
inches
of
thick
frothy
offwhite
head
formed
excellent
retention
and
generous
amounts
of
lace
left
on
the
glass
smelled
strongly
of
alcohol
dried
dark
fruits
raisin
plum
mollasses
this
had
a
hell
of
a
nose
on
it
tasted
again
of
alcohol
more
dried
fruits
and
maybe
a
hint
of
oxidation
was
smooth
up
front
with
a
somewhat
bitter
warming
alcohol
finish
very
tasty
plenty
of
carbonation
and
the
alcohol
really
shines
through
despite
the
sweetness
very
well
balanced
without
one
overpowering
flavor
pretty
drinkable
solid
brew
a
must
try
in
my
opinion
theres
good
reason
this
beer
is
highly
rated
in
its
style
its
a
great
beer
earthy
liquorous
aroma
with
coffee
some
chocolate
and
the
usual
suspects
plums
raisins
mouth
is
delicious
and
very
alcoholic
warm
chocolate
the
usual
suspects
again
brandy
vinous
and
velvety
both
in
aroma
and
in
mouth
but
without
losing
that
kind
of
roughness
or
unrefined
quality
usual
in
many
trappist
beers
did
i
tell
it
feels
vey
alcoholic
great
tasting
beer
but
the
alcohol
strength
means
one
and
out
for
me
the
time
spent
on
one
is
definitely
quality
time
drinkability
delicious
without
question
and
wellrounded
to
be
sure
admirably
lives
up
to
its
reputation
among
the
worlds
finest
bought
a
6
pack
in
belgium
pours
a
dark
brown
with
a
nice
head
the
sweet
aroma
was
awesome
had
a
malty
fruity
flavor
this
is
one
of
my
favorite
beers
of
all
i
enjoyed
this
just
as
much
as
the
westy
12
and
its
much
cheaper
i
need
to
stock
up
d
i
would
have
this
brew
again
in
a
heartbeat
but
at
the
price
it
might
be
a
while
drinkability
high
high
high
this
is
the
third
best
quad
ive
ever
tried
oelergud
a
thoroughly
topnotch
brew
thats
more
than
drinkable
sip
it
enjoy
it
and
respect
it
cheers
the
pour
revealed
a
dissapointing
head
that
was
short
lived
and
wasnt
the
head
ive
come
to
expect
with
many
belgian
ales
i
did
pour
real
slow
and
gentle
because
of
past
experiences
with
almost
exploding
belgian
heads
the
color
is
a
brownishred
with
yeast
floating
around
complex
aroma
of
sweet
malts
with
fruity
notes
absolutely
exceptional
creamy
mouthfeel
for
a
beer
this
strong
alcohol
is
wellhidden
and
has
perfect
carbonation
with
a
great
finish
this
could
be
dangerous
because
of
how
easy
it
goes
down
finish
has
a
dry
moderate
bitterness
with
a
full
body
hops
are
tasted
more
and
more
with
each
sip
thorughout
half
the
beer
this
is
very
drinkable
and
a
beer
not
for
amatuers
about
34
through
and
im
feeling
the
effects
of
the
11
30
abv
already
this
was
bought
at
town
country
liquors
in
west
springfieldmass
for
6
99bottle
overall
excellent
and
lived
up
to
its
reputation
headtohead
with
the
8
id
give
the
nod
to
the
weaker
beer
in
appearance
subject
to
rereview
and
to
the
stronger
beer
in
mouthfeel
hard
to
declare
a
winner
in
the
nose
and
taste
categories
and
both
are
extremely
drinkable
i
poured
this
into
a
nice
chalice
and
the
dark
ruby
beer
perfectly
filled
it
with
the
thick
foamy
head
just
barely
pushing
up
over
the
edge
of
the
glass
the
aroma
was
primarily
a
malty
sweetness
with
hints
of
prunes
and
other
dark
fruits
the
mouthfeel
on
this
is
great
though
its
very
rich
and
creamy
and
just
slides
down
my
throat
most
of
the
taste
is
malt
and
a
residual
sweetness
as
you
might
expect
there
are
also
some
spicy
phenolic
notes
and
the
slight
bite
of
alcohol
overall
i
like
this
beer
a
lot
but
i
might
actually
be
more
partial
to
the
rochefort
8
because
there
isnt
as
much
of
a
bite
to
it
took
the
bottle
from
the
fridge
and
poured
into
a
clean
glass
about
30
minutes
later
poured
the
color
of
root
beer
appears
to
be
a
little
cloudy
with
some
find
brown
sediment
that
settled
out
quickly
nice
creamy
tan
head
that
stuck
around
for
a
few
minutes
and
left
nice
lacing
on
the
glass
sweet
smelling
with
hints
of
cherries
oranges
and
vanilla
no
real
hop
aroma
medium
carbonation
and
mediumfull
body
a
little
hint
of
alcohol
in
the
taste
and
warming
alcohol
going
down
fairly
well
balanced
with
a
little
more
malt
than
hops
very
nice
taste
tasted
a
little
like
a
dry
red
wine
fantastic
despite
the
price
drinkability
not
going
to
have
more
than
one
of
these
in
a
sitting
a
beer
for
a
cold
night
that
needs
a
bit
of
warming
sip
on
this
bad
boy
and
enjoy
the
flavors
as
the
beer
warms
a
bit
tasty
pours
a
hazy
dark
reddishbrown
color
with
a
mountainous
fluffy
beige
head
that
coats
the
walls
of
the
glass
with
webs
of
sticky
lace
as
it
slowly
recedes
the
nose
is
quite
fruity
with
notes
of
apricot
pear
banana
apple
and
star
fruit
a
bit
of
brown
sugar
cinnamon
cake
and
brandy
round
out
the
complex
aroma
taste
begins
sweet
with
dark
malt
and
a
bit
of
candied
sugar
followed
by
notes
of
fruitcake
and
cherry
liqueur
and
a
hint
of
cocoa
the
texture
is
almost
a
perfect
creamy
smoothness
an
immensely
complex
drink
and
one
of
the
true
gems
of
the
beer
world
i
love
this
beer
dont
get
to
enjoy
one
as
often
as
i
should
imagine
if
this
was
what
we
all
knew
as
the
standard
for
all
beers
to
be
based
from
matter
of
fact
i
might
have
to
go
buy
one
right
now
for
me
to
enjoy
later
on
all
of
the
characteristics
of
this
beer
put
a
smile
on
my
face

great

i
will
enjoy
many
more
of

in

the

is
very
nice
a
subtle

warming
man
i
really
could
have
another
but
drinking
multiple
bottles
of
rochefort
is
simply
dangerous
so
ill
cellar
my
others
a
classic
worth
every
penny
ive
never
had
westvleteren
12
but
it
must
truly
be
great
to
be
considered
a
peer
or
a
superior
to
this
beer
drinkability
isnt
bad
either
the
alcohol
is
well
hidden
so
tolerance
would
seem
to
be
the
limiting
factor
here
overall
i
have
many
more
of
these
in
my
cellar
and
if
this
hasnt
already
peaked
or
is
past
its
prime
i
dont
think
i
could
comprehend
this
brew
at
its
zenith
very
well
done
age
has
made
this
one
a
thing
to
worship
served
in
a
snifter
it
pours
brown
with
some
ruby
red
tints
and
it
has
some
sediment
floating
around
the
glass
along
with
a
small
tan
head
this
is
a
very
good
smelling
beer
i
can
smell
bananas
plums
molasses
brown
sugar
toffee
and
chocolate
it
tastes
like
dark
fruit
bananas
molasses
and
a
bit
nutty
it
starts
off
sweet
and
then
has
a
lingering
bitter
finish
mouthfeel
is
mediumfull
and
its
smooth
and
creamy
drinkability
is
good
too
its
very
easy
to
drink
although
the
high
abv
starts
to
catch
up
to
me
after
a
little
while
but
the
alcohol
isnt
as
noticable
as
youd
think
it
would
be
overall
i
think
this
is
a
pretty
good
beer
id
definitely
buy
it
again
there
have
been
plenty
of
trappistes
rochefort
10
reviews
here
and
theyre
all
worth
reading
all
i
can
add
is
that
when
you
experience
this
beer
you
immediately
know
that
youve
poured
something
special
its
worldclass
perfect
and
worthy
of
this
rating
you
will
not
be
disappointed
pours
into
a
snifter

the
appearance
of
unfiltered
dark
clover

the
lingering
substantial
head
was
light
brown
almost
burnt
orange
in
some
lights
said
to
be
one
of
the
strongest
beers
in
belgium
i
could
easily
smell
this
beer
for
a
hour
and
enjoy
every
second
of
the
strong
banana
bread
nose
with
hints
of
malt
and
strawberry
an
incredible
combo
of
ripened
banana
and
sweet
malt
warms
you
as
it
finishes
remarkably
with
mild
black
pepper
notes
normally
i
might
not
be
thrilled
with
a
black
pepper
description
but
the
softness
and
complexity
of
the
taste
is
fantastic
the
mouth
feel
was
heavy
as
you
might
expect
of
a
quad
but
the
smoothness
throughout
this
huge
beer
is
what
solidifies
its
5
status
for
me
indicative
of
the
style
but
tasty
this
one
just
lets
you
know
you
cant

though
i
hear
the

debate
my
side
is
that
rochefort
is
slightly
more
complex
on
flavor
and
its
one
of
the
most
drinkable
quads
ive
experienced
i
can
only
imagine
it
improving
if
the
alcohol
that
adds
to
the
taste
and
mouthfeel
from
what
i
have
found
this
is
a

trappist
beer
that
puts
all

to

and

by

the
taste
has
more
of
the

followed
quickly
by
the
spice
and
citrus
the
citrus
combines
with
the

in

bottle
best
before
sometime
in
2009
hinting
that
i
shouldnt
be
drinking
it
just
yet
i
shouldnt
be
rating
this
as
i
am
recovering
from
a
cold
however
i
decided
to
go
ahead
anyway
because
i
think
the
beer
has
aided
in
my
recovery
only
disappointment
in
the
appearence
was
the
small
head
what
was
there
laced
pretty
well
deep
effervescent
chocolate
amber
colour
made
up
for
the
disappointing
head
aroma
um
well
big
spices
toffee
raisins
flowers
alcohol
taste
um
well
huge
and
it
needs
to
be
to
get
in
before
the
alcohol
which
is
considerable
and
smacks
you
in
the
face
at
the
finish
despite
the
big
warm
dry
kinda
like
australia
alcoholic
finish
the
balance
remains
very
good
which
is
a
big
achievement
i
think
this
is
assisted
by
the
fine
carbonation
which
leads
to
a
lush
yet
subtle
feel
would
love
to
taste
the
same
batch
in
2009
to
see
what
has
changed
think
i
might
head
back
to
the
beer
shop
awesome
a
bit
of
preface
my
first
experience
with
beer
of
this
caliber
was
st
bernardus
abt
12
i
thought
it
couldn
never
be
matched
since
then
ive
seen
numerous
threads
such
as
st
bernardus
vs
rochefort
or
westvleteren
vs
st
bernardus
i
havent
come
across
the
westy
yet
but
the
rochefort
is
always
around
so
i
thought
id
give
it
a
try
and
see
if
it
lives
up
to
the
hype
lets
crack
this
puppy
open
appears
a
very
dark
brown
color
practically
opaque
with
a
big
dark
head
resting
on
top
it
doesnt
appear
to
be
going
anywhere
incredibily
fragrant
nose
a
sweet
cakeliek
aroma
out
front
but
no
ordinary
cake
it
tingles
your
nose
with
hints
of
alcohol
and
spicyness
if
this
tastes
as
good
as
it
smells
ill
be
a
very
happy
man
oh
man
its
good
instead
of
comparing
it
to
st
bernardus
its
really
quite
different
i
can
actually
taste
the
alcohol
in
this
and
the
spicy
hops
as
well
still
the
overriding
taste
is
the
sweetness
complex
as
it
is
but
theres
a
nice
peppery
quality
to
this
beer
that
i
didnt
anticipate
mouthfeel
is
nice
and
full
with
the
perfect
amounth
of
carbonation
i
dont
know
what
it
is
but
there
certianly
is
a
distinct
trappist
feel
to
this
beer
that
i
wish
i
could
identify
and
put
into
words
but
i
cant
for
now
ill
just
enjoy
it
exceptional
mouthfeel
but
the
high
alcohol
is
too
present
in
the
taste
to
make
this
an
easydrinking
beer
its
exceptional
nonetheless
the
taste
is
great
the
first
sip
is
a
little
overwhelming
because
of
all
the
tastes
but
as
you
take
more
and
more
they
go
down
much
smoother
alcohol
is
the
first
taste
that
you
get
but
then
the
beer
effervesces
on
your
tongue
and
the
taste
dissipates
leaving
behind
a
pleasant
wheaty
mouthfeel
as
far
as
trappist
quadruples
this
is
debatable
the
top
and
it
is
true
to
its
reputation
my
thanks
go
to
john
at
federal
wines
spirits
for
donating
a
bottle
of
this
exceptional
beer
carefully
fruity
rich
sublime
and
at
once
captivating
in
the
sensuality
it
exudes
a
remarkable
brew
330
ml
bottled
on
8404
the
bottle
overflowed
with
foam
when
i
popped
the
top
really
sucks
when
youre
paying
7
for
less
than
12
oz
of
this
stuff
served
just
under
room
temp
in
a
chimay
chalice
pours
a
cloudy
dark
redbrown
with
a
fizzy
1
finger
tan
head
that
doesnt
leave
much
lacing
but
doesnt
disappear
either
smell
is
rum
bread
cherries
bananas
green
apples
and
maybe
a
hint
of
chocolate
at
first
the
carbonation
is
tingly
but
is
very
nice
by
the
end
and
so
many
flavors
on
the
palate
cherries
plums
apples
bananas
pears
citrus
coriander
chocolate
rum
pine
yeast
whew
the
beer
also
alternates
between
butterysugarysweet
and
a
somewhat
powerful
bitterness
both
of
which
complement
the
other
flavors
well
the
alcohol
is
well
hidden
in
the
taste
but
very
warming
pairs
perfectly
with
milk
chocolate
if
i
drank
another
of
these
right
now
i
would
be
out
another
7
bones
but
i
would
be
oh
so
happy
and
very
intoxicated
drinkability
good
but
at
almost
8
for
an
11
2
its
simply
too
pricey
to
be
drinkable
still
its
nice
to
have
the
real
deal
and
the
beer
is
really
well
balanced
its
controlled
complexits
just
flatout
good
if
you
can
bear
parting
with
the
cash
its
quite
a
beer
i
got
a
chance
to
try
this
beer
this
past
weekend
ive
never
been
disappointed
by
a
trappist
ale
yet
and
the
rochefort
10
was
no
different
a
wonderful
aroma
of
black
current
filled
my
nose
as
i
looked
at
this
glass
of
dark
brown
nectar
sitting
with
a
little
less
than
a
half
inch
tan
head
the
flavor
smooooth
and
rich
the
alcohol
doesent
dominate
the
glass
wonderful
balance
i
enjoyed
this
with
some
nice
cheese
savoring
it
like
a
20
year
tawny
port
the
trappistes
really
do
some
amazing
things
with
yeast
water
malt
candy
sugar
and
hops
any
one
who
calls
themselves
a
ba
should
consider
the
five
trappist
breweries
offerings
required
drinking
they
wont
regret
a
sip
of
it
well
im
not
going
to
argue
the
glowing
reviews
this
special
beer
has
gotten
perfect
in
every
way
but
drinkability
which
is
a
good
thing
at
9
a
pop
pours
black
as
night
with
a
tight
tan
head
that
wont
go
away
over
the
hour
or
so
youll
spend
sipping
it
what
a
fantastic
smell
prunes
raisins
molasses
and
cherries
im
going
to
put
a
couple
in
my
cellar
and
see
if
this
outstanding
brew
gets
even
better
with
age
beer
is
good
happy
beering
pours
a
dark
cloudy
brown
into
my
wine
glass
with
some
sediment
floating
around
no
head
to
speak
of
but
given
the
abv
thats
to
be
expected
nose
of
fruits
plum
blackcurrant
and
alcohol
taste
is
of
rich
sweet
malts
with
some
yeasty
notes
and
backed
with
strong
plum
and
blackcurrant
flavours
and
finishing
with
warming
alcohol
very
nice
mouthfeel
with
delicate
carbonation
this
is
a
lovely
beer
and
one
which
i
have
had
a
number
of
times
of
ocassions
and
will
continue
to
come
back
to
surprisingly
drinkable
given
its
abv
paired
nicely
with
some
french
brie
it
has
a
luxurious
silky
mouthfeel
while
the
alcohol
is
obvious
its
in
the
right
place
and
doesnt
intrude
very
drinkable
in
small
quantities
like
one
bottle
as
a
nightcap
with
some
stinky
cheese
notes
its
almost
as
if
the
monks
got
two
or
three
normal
beers
and
concentrated
them
into
this
complex
ale
this
is
such
a
mysterious
beer
that
people
could
likely
imagine
many
other
flavours
than
actually
exist
however
its
not
my
favourite
style
and
not
my
favourite
trappist
ale
westmalle
tripel
is
much
more
friendly
and
accessible
in
flavour
not
price
or
availability
to
most
people
but
this
beer
is
best
reserved
for
special
occasions
and
lazy
winter
nights
immense
beer
smooth
fruity
and
extremely
well
balanced
i
certainly
prefer
this
over
the
8
this
was
more
complex
and
more
satisfying
rich
on
everything
lacks
nothing
a
world
class
beer
ill
be
visiting
with
this
brew
again
the
yeast
and
plum
like
flavors
are
still
there
when
tasted
theres
a
lot
going
on
here
very
complex
the
full
bodied
mouthfeel
works
together
with
the
carbonation
theres
some
twinge
from
the
alcohol
but
it
isnt
out
of
place
and
the
warming
effect
is
perfect
for
a
cold
night
however
the
high
abv
makes
this
one
a
slow
sipper
all
in
all
a
very
very
nice
belgian
just
a
classic
belgian
strong
ale
a
great
mix
of
dark
chocolate
malt
and
fruit
yum
yum
give
me
some
more
p
s
im
editing
and
giving
this
a
perfect
score
cuz
i
believe
this
is
the
most
interesting
and
best
beer
i
ever
had
an
absolute
must
in
my
book
not
that
drinkable
to
be
honest
a
sippin
brew
for
sure
need
me
some
more
beautiful
beer
all
around
but
be
careful
having
too
many
of
these
in
a
row
as
they
may
impair
your
ability
to
taste
and
rate
any
other
beers
accurately
flavors
of
rich
malt
and
yeast
are
followed
by
dark
plum
and
strong
alcohol
and
a
bitter
earthy
aftertaste
the
alcohol
is
a
little
too
powerful
in
the
finish
overall
this
is
an
intense
beer
with
very
complex
flavors
and
moderate
drinkability
definatley
one
to
seek
out
been
waiting
to
try
this
for
a
while
looked
really
good
pours
a
nice
dark
brown
body
with
some
hints
of
ruby
in
the
light
huge
light
tan
head
great
retention
all
the
way
to
the
end
very
sweet
smelling
lotsa
malt
in
here
think
i
smell
a
grape
aroma
too
very
smooth
though
a
slight
tinge
of
alcohol
taste
at
the
roof
of
the
mouth
i
dont
really
mind
that
tasted
better
as
it
warmed
up
very
warming
as
it
went
down
i
havent
had
many
beers
that
do
that
mouthfeel
is
pleasent
almost
velvety
great
beer
couldnt
wait
to
have
this
highly
lauded
brew
it
poured
with
a
deep
brown
and
opaque
body
with
a
head
that
was
cloudy
tannish
and
substantial
the
nose
is
alluring
with
notes
of
raisin
malt
andor
plum
the
mouthfeel
is
almost
chewy
but
also
has
a
juicy
texture
the
fullness
is
also
there
i
mostly
sense
a
raisin
and
brandylike
character
that
is
complemented
nicely
by
a
juicy
malt
kick
you
can
finally
get
a
sense
for
that
high
alcohol
content
right
at
the
beginning
of
the
finish
mostly
you
get
a
continued
raisin
and
plum
layer
that
is
balanced
by
a
nice
little
bitter
balance
about
midway
through
the
finish
by
midbottle
you
realize
how
much
of
a
belly
warmer
this
really
is
truly
a
world
class
beer
ah
the
trappists
the
beer
pours
a
deep
dark
brown
color
with
a
14
offwhite
head
that
quickly
fades
to
spotty
lacing
the
aroma
is
great
it
has
a
very
rich
and
intense
roasted
malt
scent
that
boasts
of
roasted
barley
and
belgian
caramel
malts
very
nice
it
is
sweet
and
dry
the
taste
is
good
it
has
a
creamy
yet
powerful
brown
ale
flavor
with
lots
of
caramel
malts
and
a
tart
yeast
finish
it
goes
down
smooth
and
is
surprisingly
thin
and
dry
on
the
finish
the
mouthfeel
is
decent
it
is
a
medium
bodied
brew
with
adequate
carbonation
this
is
a
great
tasting
brew
with
lots
of
enticing
malt
aroma
i
wish
it
had
a
little
more
body
but
otherwise
its
a
good
drinker
drinkability
best
beer
ive
ever
had
i
dunno
definitely
not
the
most
available
or
most
practical
considering
its
price
and
availability
in
the
area
is
it
worthy
of
being
rated
the
10th
best
beer
in
the
world
absolutely
11
3
abv
packed
into
an
astoundingly
complex
belgian
such
as
this
meant
to
sip
and
enjoy
a
pinnacle
of
the
style
and
of
beer
in
general
after
a
new
batch
of
this
came
in
the
first
batch
imported
to
the
us
since
by
merchant
du
vin
as
opposed
to
shelton
bros
my
judgement
has
changed
this
beer
knocks
the
socks
off
of
any
other
beer
ive
ever
tasted
has
a
nice
bubblegummy
taste
and
aroma
with
a
plethora
of
fruity
esters
just
the
perfect
balance
between
sweet
dry
and
bitter
just
enough
alcohol
punch
to
get
you
a
nice
buzz
without
going
overboard
by
the
way
it
seems
much
less
boozy
this
time
through
to
the
point
where
it
is
damn
near
chuggable
i
must
stock
up
on
this
stuff
excellent
ale
just
a
bit
heavy
on
the
alcohol
not
hidden
very
well
i
love
belgians
and
so
im
hoping
this
was
a
bad
bottle
or
that
perhaps
gasp
my
taste
was
off
today
maybe
i
will
try
it
again
but
from
a
different
source
the
only
think
i
can
really
ding
it
on
is
drinkability
even
though
the
11
alcohol
is
hidden
pretty
well
there
is
just
a
little
harshness
that
comes
through
nothing
that
should
steer
anyone
away
from
having
this
on
their
best
beers
list
in
my
opinion
this
beer
is
a
little
better
than
the
st
bernardus
12
like
my
brother
said
it
is
a
bit
like
drinking
liquid
applepie
a
magnificent
brew
i
will
have
to
admit
at
first
try
i
was
not
very
impressed
with
this
one
i
read
all
the
reviews
and
thought
that
this
had
to
be
better
so
i
went
out
and
bought
alot
more
of
them
i
found
out
that
with
this
and
all
other
trappist
beers
you
have
to
be
really
careful
at
which
temperature
you
serve
this
at
ounce
i
got
that
down
i
found
the
dark
appearance
rather
inviting
after
talking
to
many
belgium
people
at
the
different
festivals
i
found
that
many
of
them
like
this
its
just
what
they
call
a
beerwine
so
i
took
that
to
heart
and
treated
it
like
wine
before
every
drink
i
will
swish
it
around
and
smell
it
for
me
that
is
enough
im
in
love
the
taste
is
phenomenal
with
just
that
right
bitter
taste
that
from
much
research
comes
from
the
water
the
fruitiness
of
this
is
bar
none
only
to
westvleteren
which
also
has
a
distinct
fruity
taste
for
convenience
though
i
stick
with
rochefort
for
anyone
looking
for
a
top
notch
beer
that
will
surprise
them
from
aroma
till
aftertaste
this
is
a
must
have
id
go
on
to
say
some
more
but
i
think
im
going
to
savour
the
rest
of
this
drink
the
beer
is
dark
brown
with
some
red
with
lingering
sediment
running
about
the
glass
the
chunky
bubbly
creamcolored
head
dissipates
slightly
but
is
retained
in
about
a
2mm
thickness
throughout
the
drink
lacing
is
present
and
sturdy
but
not
overwhelming
carbonation
is
certainly
evident
upon
first
sip
but
its
run
over
with
a
rummage
of
caramel
paper
early
yeast
fruitiness
and
tempered
hops
the
smell
is
as
busy
as
the
taste
taste
is
light
spice
molasses
raisin
maybe
plum
the
10
is
eminently
creamy

here
based

not

my
previous

im
wondering
if
i
got
a
bum
bottle
not
that
this
isnt
good
its
just
that
nothing
jumps
out
at
me
based
on
the
price
this
one
i
could
get
twice
the
amount
of
beer
for
less
than
twice
the
cost
by
buying
the
st

like
a

i
could

to

interesting

taste
takes
the
aroma
to
another
level
smooth
malt
character
quickly
gives
way
to
flavors
of
banana
and
other
fruits
with
a
slightly
spicy
aftertaste
mouthfeel
is
tremendous
and
drinkability
is
excellent
as
well
scarily
drinkable
for
11

the
alcohol
hardly
comes
out
at
all
except
for
the
subtle
warming
after
youve
had
a
few
mouthfuls
a
must
try
and
revisiting
will
be
inevitable
drinkability
is
a
shortcoming
but
only
because
of
its
abv
if
it
wasnt
so
strong
this
would
be
5s
across
the
board
but
only
because
it
doesnt
go
to

the

i
may
have
to
soak
off
the

and
seen
what
lies
beneath
what
a
great

nice
complexity
of

alcohol
that
contributes
to
complexity
yet
never
overpowers
the
flavor
and
even
in
the
aftermath
of
warming
only
adds
to
the
appreciation
of
the
beer
never
detracts
i
am
unsure
what
i
paid
for
this
beer
but
it
was
certainly
worth
every
penny
this
is
easily
the
best
beer
ive
ever
tried
drinkability
high
abv
and
price
make
it
less
drinkable
than
other
quads
what
a
beer
the
only
negative
thing
you
can
say
about
this
beer
is
that
its
not
clear
drinking
this
beer
regulary
its
always
looking
like
a
snowstorm
in
my
glass
but
what
the
hell
great
trappist
smell
yeasty
and
malts
a
nice
and
not
too
sweet
taste
and
a
good
aftertaste
with
fine
hops
good
trappist
beer
was
very
surprised
to
find
this
rare
beer
around
here
thank
you
smokeless
joes
poured
an
impressive
brown
with
a
hint
of
plum
and
a
lingering
tan
head
smell
was
impressive
as
well
floral
with
plum
and
prune
esters
taste
this
is
worth
noting
it
started
very
stealthy
dark
fruits
and
some
malts
but
going
down
it
is
smooth
almost
unbelivably
so
the
world
slowed
to
a
crawl
around
me
and
for
what
seemed
like
an
eternity
there
was
nothing
be
me
and
the
beer
i
heard
a
buzzing
in
my
ears
and
noticed
my
friend
what
talking
to
me
i
told
him
to
give
me
a
minute
it
is
a
very
complex
beer
with
a
velvetysmooth
mouthfeel
and
i
really
must
try
it
again
to
take
it
all
in
outstanding
if
i
could
afford
to
drink
this
all
day
i
probably
would
poured
a
dark
hazy
brown
with
a
larger
brownish
head
aromas
of
spices
plums
and
raisins
tastes
of
spices
malts
fruity

and
lightly

these
quadrupels
are
rarely

and
always
a
little
hard
to
cozy
up
to
but
nothing
else
in

approximates
the
sense
of

contained
in
them
best

i
ever
had
copper
with
a
beig
head
albeit
not
a
big
one
nose
of
caramel
fruit
and
a
whiff
of
alcohol
creamy
smooth
to
the
palate
some
complex
fruity
caramel
like
flavors
but
not
a
big

belying
the
big

simply
the

dark

and
chocolate
with
just
a
note

taste
gives
no
hint
of
alcohol
its
dangerously
drinkable
heavy
notes
of
chocolate
taper
off
into
flavors
of
raisins
very
little
after
taste
this
is
one
heavingly
beer
and
one
of
the
best
quads
ive
yet
to
try
ill
be
buying
more
ive
been
looking
for
the
right
night
to
try
this
and
it
seems
today
is
the
day
this
beer
pours
a
nice
opaque
brown
with
about
a
finger
of
head
that
sticks
around
for
the
show
what
a
nice
malty
nose
i
get
a
full
in
my
face
sweet
fig
nose
with
an
alcohol
punch
that
reminds
me
more
of
a
liquor
than
a
beer
the
flavor
is
nicely
balanced
there
is
the
malty
fig
flavor
but
it
is
balanced
with
a
caramel
sweetness
and
a
smokey
char
finish
what
a
treat
well
worth
the
hype
and
the
wait
to
drink
it
now
i
have
to
convince
myself
to
let
it
warm
a
bit
more
before
i
finish
it
to
see
what
else
is
hiding
in
the
nose
and
flavor
the
beer
is
thick
with
just
a
hint
of
small
carbonation
drinkability
is
top
notch
i
could
easily
handle
a
few
of
these
even
with
the
high
abv
its
nice
and
smooth
without
an
offensive
alcohol
to
make
me
want
to
slow
down
on
it
i
will
be
getting
this
one
again
and
soon
a
real
disappointment
for
me
where
is
the
complexity
just
because
it
has
alcohol
doesnt
mean
it
is
good
no
hops
and
not
all
that
much
yeast
character
i
dont
understand
this
beer
ya
know
for
all
the
hype
i
was
kinda
let
down
pours
and
looks
like
iced
tea
no
head
whatsoever
aroma
is
pretty
nice
smells
of
raisins
and
a
hint
of
something
like
capt
morgan
rum
taste
is
well
kinda
bland
a
bit
sweet
some
alcohol
is
present
nothing
great
just
good
mouthfeel
would
be
better
if
there
was
more
carbonation
maybe
belgians
just
arent
my
thing
maybe
this
was
a
bad
bottle

comments
a
very
enjoyable
big
beer
with
multilayered
flavors
outstanding
drinkability
if
i
didnt
have
a
talk
to
go
to
this
would
have
been
a
repeat
performer
there
and
then
regardless
of
the
10
price
tag
this
doesnt
even
remotely
hide
the
alcohol
content
it
celebrates
it
a
delicious
offering
when
its
all
said
and
done
deep

lace
around
the
glass
aroma
is
initially
astringent
and
wine
like
but
more
complex
smells
and
flavors
emerge
as
the
beer
warms

dried

caramel
and
an
earthy

is

mouthfeel

an

and
a
surprising
amount

effervescence
this
bottle
had
a
best
by
date
of
14jan08
poured
a
deep
hazy
brown
in
my
trappist
glass
with
a
small
head
which
quickly
dissipated
leaving
a
thin
creamy
layer
along
with
moderate
carbonation
i
left
the
last
12
inch
in
the
bottle
as
it
contained
the
majority
of
the
sediment
smell
was
warm
doughy
bread
with
raisins
prunes
alcohol
and
a
hint
of
coriander
marvelous
medium
palate
with
a
lively

flavor
was
dark
fruits
similar
to
the
smell
with
a
warm
moderately
strong
alcohol
bite
and
a
mild
acidic
finish
great
stuff
i
can
get
more
of
this
however
at
6

for
a
33cl

will
limit
my
intake
if
the
trappists
are
as
correct

they
are

this
poured
out
a
cloudy
brown
color
with

highlights
it
had
a
decent
sized
tan
head
that
quickly
dropped
to
a
coated
of
bubbles
that
left
subtle
lace
around
the
glass
as
it
was
consumed
there
was
quite
a
bit
of
sediment
left
in
the
bottle
after
the
pour
as
well
the
aroma
smells
of
malt
sweetness
various
fruits
and
a
bit
of
an
herbal
earthy
tone
to
it
there
is
also
a
couple
of
notes
spiciness
to
the
scent
and
a
couple
of
other
smells
that
were
not
identified
leading
the
way
in
the
taste
is
a
fruity
sweetness
that
is
also
accompanied
by
a
doughy
malt
flavor
and
slight
bit
of
spice
it
has
a
bit
of
a
dry
finish
and
a
buttery
taste
going
on
as
well
very
refreshing
to
sip
on
this
warm
day
and
no
trace
of
alcohol
anywhere
mouthfeel
is
rich
and
about
medium
to
full
in
body
it
goes
down
very
easy
and
is
a
very
balanced
beer
a
truly
all
around
excellent
beer
highly
recommended
to
anyone
with
the
many
complexities
to
this
i
will
defiantly
be
having
many
more
of
these
in
the
future
my
only
down
point
is
that
the
alcohol
is
still
a
little
out
of
balance
but
i
guess
thats
the
price
you
pay
for
all
that

those
beers

you
just
have
to
try
before
you
depart

existance
it
may
not
be
everyones
cup
of
tea

good
golly
its
a
champion
brew
in

its

pricey
but
mindblowing
awesome
but
one
whiff
to
sense
the
alcohol
and
yeast
started
decaying
my
perception
of
it
but
still
seemed
spicy
and
valid
to
drink
i
went
right
on
and
the
overwhelming
alcohol
poorly
hidden
as
well
as
the
excessive
inadequate
abundance
of
sweetness
mixed
with
an
oily
mouthfeel
repulsed
me
slightly
not
completely
and
dropped
my
judgment
immediately
sad
i
held
this
one
til
the
last
minute
here
in
paris
unpurchased
waiting
for
a
good
surprise
im
sticking
to
chimay
et
co
pours
a
deep
brown
orange
amber
color
and
makes
a
thin
yet
condensed
bubbly
white
head
thick
lacing
down
my
chimay
goblet
odor
is
rich
of
prunes
raisins
figs
very
chocolatey
very
nice
flavor
holds
true
of
the
boquet
very
spicy
pruney
roasted
chocolate
malts
hint
of
currant
and
an
alcoholic
bite
mouthfeel
is
medium
to
full
warms
the
pallate
as
it
goes
down
leaves
a
syrupy
coat
on
the
throat
this
is
a
very
drinkable
beer
but
like
any
trappist
should
be
savored
i
think
rochefort
10
would
go
very
nicely
with
a
fine
cut
of
beef
this
is
a
highly
warming
sipper
its
like
drinking
chocolate
except
so
much
better
not
sure
why
this
is
a
quadrupel
i
wouldve
guessed
belgian
dark
strong
very
delicious
great
beer
will
get
it
again
if
westy
is
not
available
a
pleasure
to
drink
but
at
8
for
that
one
glass
bottle
not
something
i
can
consume
often
ruby
red
body
is
slightly
hazy
as
i
am
careful
about
not
pouring
the
yeast
dregs
in
the
goblet
the
foamy
head
is
about
an
inch
and
a
half
tall
after
the
pour
and
sticks
around
a
while
being
fed
by
very
fine
bubbles
from
the
medium
carbonation
beneath
nice
lace
is
evident
around
the
glass
the
aroma
is
deliciously
fruity
with
plums
cherries
raisins
and
licorice
notes
the
taste
is
delicately
balanced
between
fruitiness
of
the
malt
and
spiciness
of
the
yeast
there
are
also
notes
of
brown
sugar
on
the
palette
the
mouthfeel
is
very
creamy
due
to
the
fineness
of
the
carbonation
it
is
incredibly
smooth
and
drinkable
with
almost
no
hint
of
the
underlying
strength
this
is
a
picture
perfect
mold
from
which
other
belgian
strong
dark
ales
are
cast
but
as
usual
the
imitations
pale
when
compared
to
the
brilliance
of
the
original
a
smooth
clean
refreshing
body
along
with
some
moderate
carbonation
make
this
one
all
around
good
beer
easy
to
drink
delicious
murky
mocha
colored
with
a
dark
beige
head
of
tight
bubbles
that
rises
up
and
settles
quickly
but
leaves
a
thin
film
of
foam
atop
aroma
is
sweet
and
enticing
of
sweet
malt
fig
cocoa
and
spices
mouthfeel
is
full
and
creamy
a
little
crisp
and
dry
leading
to
rich
flavors
of
malt
and
plum
rounded
out
with
currant
spices
and
prune
a
bitter
aftertaste
lingers
followed
by
an
alcoholic
tingle
the
alcohol
lingers
long
into
each
successive
sip
and
detracts
from
the
fine
flavors
wanting
to
burst
through
an
excellent
beer
but
much
seems
to
be
masked
it
is
because
of
beers
like
this
that
i
have
been
forced
to
reassess
what
my
favorite
style
is
i
still
like
my
stouts
porters
but
damned
if
the
belgians
arent
getting
the
best
of
me

second
tasting
december
2004
and
it
met
my
desire
again
special
stuff
i
had
this
beer
with
a
big
grilled
steak
and
it
went
very
well
complex
is
an
understatement
this
is
a
very
complicated
intriguing
and
wonderful
beer
drinking
this
is
an
experience
not
just
another
quaff
i
wonder
what
it
takes
to
become
a
trappist
monk
i
might
just
send
them
a
resume
nice
a
yes
had
one
of
these
with
alexgash
pours
a
mysterious
murky
dark
brown
im
not
really
sure
what
to
expect
here
light
dense
khaki
colored

rich
dark
fruit
chocolate
and
raw
malt
aromas
taste
is
wonderful
rich
chocolatey
alcohol
flavors
mixed
with
mild
dark
fruits
and
an
almost
roasted
quality
you
could
almost
call
this
a
belgian
imp
stout
instead
of
the
hops
weve
got
sweet
flavorful
yeast
flavors
coming
through
goes
down
so
easy
for
being
11

as
to
be
dangerous
a
beer
worthy
of
its
praises
huge
creamy
tan
head
atop
this
cloudy
dark
mahogany
beer
very
sweet
smells
of
raisins
plums
and
strong
malts
hints
of
alcohol
spices
the
taste
of
plums
and
raisins
hit
the
palate
first
followed
by
a
peppery
spice
and
a
warming
alcohol
feel
very
sweet
smooth
tastes
the
strong
old
malts
finish
this
beer
of
quite
well
and
add
a
bit
of
complexity
dries
in
the
aftertaste
in
conclusion
this
is
a
delicious
brew
that
i
wish
i
could
get
ahold
of
more
often
wow
thats
a
damn
good
beer
i
poured
it
into
the
glass
and
held
it
up
to
the
light
it
was
dark
as
could
be
took
a
sniff
and
knew
that
it
was
going
to
taste
great
this
beer
did
not
disappoint
i
think
the
belgian
strong
dark
ales
are
beginning
to
edge
out
the
dubbels
as
my
favorite
style
i
could
drink
this
beer
every
day
3
or
4
times
a
day
and
never
grow
tired
of
it
i
believe
i
will
have
to
run
up
to
richmond
this
weekend
and
find
some
more
which
brings
us
to
its
drinkabilty
it
has
alot
of
that
wow
very
scrumptious
just
thick
enough
fluffy
and
glides
down
with
astounding
ease
moderate
overall
really
in
my
book
was
hoping
for
a
bit
more
and
the
rochefort
8
i
like
just
a
bit
more
still
this
is
very
quenchable
and
wouldnt
pass
it
up
for
nothing
price
wise
it
might
be
8
for
11
2
ounces
its
almost
worth
it
here
a
world
apart
from
the
tasty
rochefort
8
with
much
more
complex
flavors
and
higher
drinkability
i
think
that
the
alcohol
is
handled
much
better
here
even
though
its
more
evident
than
the
8
its
also
more
flavorful
and
actually
adds
to
the
experience
of
the
beer
rochefort
10
may
be
the
perfect
beer
to
enjoy
after
dinner
treat
it
like
some
good
whisky
pause
and
relax
ng
7
99
for
a
11
2oz
yikes
meld
of
hops
and
malt
you
can
taste
the
alcohol
but
it
does
not
interfere
with
the
sheer
pleasure
of
sipping
a
glass
of
this
classic
portlike
with
a
refreshing
effervescence
i
could
drink
this
beer
for
the
rest
of
my
life
i
wish
it
were
not
so
expensive
and
hard
to
come
by
here
in
the
big
easy
this
is
drinkable
and
there
are
hundreds
of
beers
that
i
would
turn
down
to
get
one
of
these
but
there
are
so
many
others
that
i
think
are
better
the
warming
alcohol
while
noticeable
is
well
within
the
overall
balance
of
aroma
and
flavor
this
is
a
nice
rich
trappist
to
enjoy
by
the
fire
with
fine
cheeses
dessert
or
just
as
a
pleasant
nightcap
a
light
brown
offred
hue
with
a
thick
bubblebathlike
head
which
acts
as
a
layer
throughout
the
body
of
this
well
crafted
brew
on
the
nose
a
tinge
of
alcohol
cotton
candy
fruit
fresh
flowers
up
front
chewy
and
a
bit
sugary
yet
now
overdominating
alcoholic
presence
off
the
top
again
not
too
overpowering
or
distracting
extremely
well
balanced
and
in
tact
everything
in
this
brew
appears
to
be
in
place
incredible
flavorings
in
the
way
of
bubble
gum
cotton
candy
plums
cocoa
some
spices
as
it
warms
even
cloves
and
orange
peel
a
decent
bellywarmer
near
the
end
with
some
notes
of
smokiness
yeast
and
fresh
baked
bread
the
alcohol
effect
is
incredibly
well
hidden
for
the
styleabv
this
one
is
almost
addicting
near
liquid
perfection
thick
creamy
light
tan
head
almost
makes
it
look
like
a
nitro
theres
a
fair
amount
of
stringy
above
the
chocolatey
brown
beer
rich
alchoholic
plum
and
raisins
mixed
with
chocolate
bars
and
apples
i
dont
know
if
ive
done
the
aroma
any
justice
but
its
damn
good
a
mild
blend
of
dark
fruits
a
bit
of
caramel
and
some
followed
up
my
a
lightly
bitter
and
alcoholic
finish
silky
smooth
mouthfeel
with
a
moderately
full
body
the
11
alcohol
barely
makes
itself
known
this
is
one
great
beer
just
the
right
mix
of
flavors
and
aromas
combined
with
a
smooth
drinking
beer
so
many
flavors
such
little
amount
of
beer
i
have
to
find
them
all
that
is
what
i
thought
about
this
beer
the
complexity
was
staggering
11
2
oz
was
not
enough
but
i
cant
afford
any
more
than
that
this
was
a
very
dark
beer
for
a
belgian
and
it
had
a
nice
frothy
tan
head
to
show
its
carbonation
lots
of
lacing
smell
is
strong
and
has
a
raisiny
bready
flavor
to
it
taste
is
just
too
complex
to
describe
it
starts
out
with
a
tang
hit
of
chocolate
and
caramel
malts
some
floral
hops
come
lightly
into
the
mix
a
bready
character
soon
follows
then
fruity
sensations
run
wild
dark
plums
and
raisins
dominating
my
palate
a
rumlike
quality
is
there
all
along
but
only
increases
to
epic
proportions
towards
the
end
yeast
is
quite
sour
and
extremely
dry
in
the
finish
this
is
a
beer
to
savor
and
sip
very
slowly
the
only
drawback
was
the
price
for
this
at
10bottle
i
cant
afford
too
many
of
these
poured
ruby
and
black
into
rochefort
goblet
lots
of
beige
colored
flakiness
in
suspension
hovering
on
the
bottom
of
the
goblet
light
brown
foam
lots
of
dark
roasted
candi
sugar
and
malt
in
the
nose
coffee
and
fruit
taste
is
complex
smooth
rich
and
amazing
so
many
changes
in
the
palate
as
one
sips
malt
sweet
and
candi
raisin
and
currant
yet
maintaining
a
dryness
that
is
fantastic
ive
had
this
beer
a
couple
of
times
and
its
just
really
really
good
its
dated
26
08
08
b
b
aug
8
2008
so
its
kind
of
young
but
with
this
beer
thats
good
sparkling
black
cristal
damn
now
that
was
how
to
start
off
2004
given
how
long
the
monks
at
the
abbaye
de
notredame
de
saintrémy
have
been
brewing
this
beer
they
certainly
have
got
it
finetuned
truly
a
worldclass
beer
pours
very
dark
opaque
with
barely
visible
hints
of
red
visible
in
the
light
thick
foamy
head
quickly
recedes
the
smell
of
this
beer
presents
so
many
thoughts
but
they
all
seem
to
meld
together
perfectly
the
smells
are
subtle
and
elusive
malts
are
present
with
ints
of
chocolate
various
fruits
coffee
and
some
meaty
spices
the
taste
is
very
spicy
again
almost
meaty
with
the
chocolate
hints
again
and
nutty
coffee
hints
the
heavy
carbonation
of
tiny
bubbles
gives
it
a
dry
mouthfeel
which
smooths
out
on
the
back
amazingly
i
thought
it
was
maybe
8
abv
until
my
brother
told
me
that
it
was
tipping
11
this
says
alot
for
the
drinkability
of
this
beer
simply
an
amazing
beer
pourred
a
dark
brew
with
a
nice
foamy
white
head
with
excellent
retention
time
complex
aroma
of
spice
and
roastiness
arose
from
my
glass
taste
of
spice
is
complex
and
alcohol
taste
is
subtle
which
is
great
achievement
at
11
3
body
if
full
and
support
well
the
mix
of
spice
from
this
beer
always
great
to
review
a
trappist
beer
when
they
are
so
perfect
as
this
one
clearly
is
the
only
thing
i
can
compare
this
to
is
chimay
red
wow
top
notch
tipple
world
class
beer
this
is
a
lightly
hazy
deep
red
amber
color
when
held
up
to
the
light
it
is
dark
amber
to
brown
otherwise
it
is
topped
by
a
light
brown
head
aromas
of
dark
fruit
fruitcake
and
rum
the
taste
has
a
lightly
spicy
yeast
character
there
is
a
light
sweetness
though
this
beer
is
fairly
light
bodied
flavor
notes
of
raisin
and
other
dark
fruit
are
under
the
spicy
notes
of
this
beer
the
spiciness
adds
a
complexity
to
this
beer
that
was
not
in
the
6
but
i
think
that
the
6
was
better
integrated
than
this
beer
in
mouth
nice
complexity
roasted
notes
controled
alcohol
sweet
nectar
everything
is
well
balanced
in
here
overall
impression
what
a
great
beer
the
flavor
just
blooms
in
your
senses
also
has
a
wonderful
cognaclike
essence
rochefort
is
truly
one
of
the
best
trappist
breweries
world
class
i
enjoyed
this
one
much
better
than
the
westy
12
in
fact
this
rochefort
10
was
the
best
ive
ever
had
anywhere
anytime
a
sublime
experience
thus
my
first
5s
across
the
board
definitely
worth
the
price
of
admission
perfection
in
a
bottle
the
best
beer
around
perhaps
but
i
still
havent
had
westy
12
yet
not
that
impressed
with
this
one
upon
pouring
it
honestly
looked
like
i
just
dumped
a
can
of
pepsi
into
my
glass
it
was
perhaps
the
most
carbonated
brew
ive
ever
seen
the
head
was
bubbly
as
hell
and
disappeared
instantly
still
it
had
a
better
than
average
dark
rubybrown
colour
to
it
the
smell
was
actually
quite
nice
incorporating
malt
cherry
and
some
other
sweet
smells
the
taste
followed
suit
with
the
smell
but
was
a
bit
more
syrupy
than
i
expected
and
the
carbonation
that
was
so
apparent
in
the
pour
was
virtually
gone
strange
there
is
a
strong
alcohol
presence
in
the
taste
as
well
to
the
point
that
it
is
almost
medicinal
needs
to
be
toned
down
a
bit
methinks
overall
not
that
drinkable
of
a
brew
for
7
a
pop
id
be
inclined
to
try
it
again
just
to
see
if
perhaps
i
had
a
bad
bottle
but
its
nothing
special
in
my
eyes
this
is
damn
near
a
perfect
beer
and
that
is
despite
its
massive
abv
the
10
poured
a
odd
group
of
colors
stout
black
with
a
foggy
white
head
at
first
glance
a
closer
look
revealed
the
top
of
the
glass
to
be
more
a
brown
color
with
the
bottom
opaque
smell
was
insanely
good
a
huge
bevy
of
aromas
melded
so
well
together
swirls
of
licorice
chocolate
dough
a
musty
belgianesque
note
and
a
spicy
alcohol
finish
that
tickled
the
back
of
my
nose
the
taste
was
even
more
intense
if
that
is
possible
huge
notes
of
alcohol
and
anise
coupled
with
a
bittersweet
chocolate
upfront
with
hints
of
toffee
behind
cascading
into
a
tart
cherry
middle
which
developed
into
a
almost
stout
like
malt
finish
without
the
volumonous
mouthfeel
the
addition
of
the
yeast
subdued
the
mouthfeel
but
melded
and
increased
the
intesity
of
all
the
flavors
especially
in
the
aroma
if
this
is
what
being
a
monk
is
likewhich
i
know
its
not
then
you
can
sign
me
up
dont
get
much
prettier
no
sir
a
black
hole
of
a
brew
yet
with
a
very
faint
and
i
mean
faint
dollop
of
amber
at
the
bottom
of
the
glass
the
head
and
lace
are
concrete
structures
aromas
are
very
ripe
and
fruity
with
melon
at
the
forefront
some
botrytis
aromas
appear
as
well
the
mouthfeel
is
very
enjoyableat
once
enveloping
the
entire
mouth
with
warmth
and
bursts
of
barnyard
flavors
flavors
are
redolent
of
blue
cheesefunky
moldy
fruity
yes
very
much
blue
cheese
esc
id
bet
it
would
pair
like
a
dream
a
sweetness
in
the
way
of
coffee
with
heavy
cream
and
sugar
adds
to
the
complexity
all
in
all
very
wine
like
in
flavor
with
great
depth
of
flavor
the
ever
present
fruity
funkiness
will
not
be
for
everyone
straight
off
that
is
yet
this
is
one
that
will
grow
on
you
for
sure
i
will
reedit
it
each
time
i
taste
it
superior
stuff
appearance
was
dark
brown
with
a
creamy
white
head
that
held
on
to
the
last
drop
smelled
of
brown
sugar
and
bruised
apples
tasted
like
dark
roasted
malts
and
had
quite
spectacular
ester
profile
of
sweet
fruits
and
real
sun
dried
raisins
to
go
along
with
a
slightly
yeasty
flavor
the
mouthful
was
thick
and
creamy
with
a
slightly
oily
tinge
to
the
tongue
one
of
the
first
truly
unique
beers
ive
ever
had
so
many
flavors
intermingle
to
tantalize
the
pallet
very
hard
to
describe
just
how
excellent
this
beer
truly
is

alcohol
was
there
in
force
but
the
flavoring

was
not
overdone
and
lent
some

quite
drinkable
for
the
abv
heft
update

i
have
this
occasionally
and
decided
to
rereview
for
2004
i
was
able
to
pick
up
some
tobacco
at
the
nose
to
go
along
with
all
of
the
wonderful
fruits
it
seemed
a
little
more
boozy
though
then
i
remember
so
i
shaved
a
half
point
off
of
the
mf
when
everyone
speaks
of
trappists
they
talk
about
westvleteren
and
rightly
so
however
rochefort
is
every
bit
as
good
and
i
think
i
enjoyed
it
even
more
a
very
underrated
beer
and
definitely
a
new
favorite
on
my
list
the
alcohol
warming
is
prominent
deep
black
color
lacy

big

but

predominates
warms
the
tummy
well
smooth
taste
excellent
flavor
mouthfeel
is
full
and
round
finish
is
malty
and
dry
aftertaste
is
malty
and
slightly
bitter
with
a
definite
alcohol
bite
great
beer
dark
brown
with
dried

the
offwhite

is

it
is
inviting
but
not
that
potent
very
tasty
palate
with
loads
of

spiciness
upfront
that
sizzles
the
tongue
a
pleasant
pain
peppery
lightly
funkymedicinal
the
amount
of
bitterness
is
great
the
maltiness
is
not
as
pronounced
as
i
though
it
should
be
lightly
sweet
like
candied
sugar
exotic
fruitiness
there
are
plenty
of
subtle
complexities
so
delicious
to

the
mouthfeel
is
slightly
creamy
long
finish
moreish
aftertaste
this
one
is
great
and
i
wish
i
had
more
very
recommended
the
mouthfeel
is
really
good
its
silky
smooth
and
perfectly
carbonated
however
whopping
in
at
this
high
abv
it
might
not
be
the
most
drinkable
of
them
all
what
a
dissapointment
medicinal
sour
and
bitter
i
really
dont
see
what
all
the
hype
is
about
i
hope
this
was
just
a
bad
bottle
but
at
7
bones
a
pop
i
wont
be
giving
it
a
retry
any
time
soon
it
looked
nice
it
smelled
nice
but
it
tasted
like
cough
medicine
served
in
an
ashtray
after
you
just
brushed
your
teeth
the
beer
did
get
better
as
it
warmed
and
the
alcohol
did
make
it
a
bit
more
palatable
but
all
in
all
i
think
it
was
a
bad
beer
after
trying
all
the
great
unibroue
beers
this
one
fell
far
short

certainly
not

in

this

is
in

the

outrageous
usd
9
for
a
small
bottle
in
the
store
this
beer
pours
a
murky
dark
brown
color
with
a
decent
head
and
some
lacing
on
the
glass
the
aroma
was
very
fruity
and
malty
very
pleasant
much
like
the
rochefort
8
this
was
a
good
beer
the
alcohol
is
much
more
apparent
in
this
one
as
opposed
to
the
rochefort
8
so
i
have
to
say
that
i
think
the
8
is
a
little
more
smooth
and
easy
to
drink
the
flavor
represented
the
aroma
well
fruity
malty
and
laced
with
alcohol
another
great
belgian
beer
appears
deep
auburn
brown
but
when
held
up
to
bright
light
appears
a
deep
redish

color
a
really
beautiful
looking
beer
head
is
creamy
tan
and
very
tight
settling
down
to
about
a
quarter
inch
and
resting
there
aroma
is
a
complex
one
very
fruity
and
raisin
like
aromas
alcohol
also
present
a
bit
earthy
as
well
a
rich
strongly
flavored
beer
which
is
fruity
and
malty
with
a
good
kick
has
a
very
smooth
and
delicate
mouthfeel
with
just
a
bit
of
a
bite
to
it
near
the
finish
nice
warming
effect
creeps
up
on
you
an
exceptional
ale
11
2oz
bottle
poured
into
a
rochefort
chalice
it
pours
a
dark
brown
color
with
3
thick
fingers
of
dense
rocky
light
tan
foam
the
head
stays
along
for
the
ride
the
entire
time
and
there
is
lots
and
lots
of
lace
left
on
the
glass
the
smell
is
rich
in
chocolate
and
raisins
with
a
little
hint
of
alcohol
not
really
as
big
of
a
smell
as
i
was
expecting
the
taste
is
fairly
malty
with
raisins
and
plums
coming
right
out
there
is
some
hops
and
alcohol
to
the
finish
the
mouthfeel
is
strong
yet
this
is
a
super
smooth
brew
the
drinkability
is
pretty
good
for
being
11
3
abv
yet
another
fine
belgian
and
then
hey
not
overly
carbonated
or
aggressive
in
flavor
more
gentle
in
its
maltiness
and
hoppiness
than
i
would
have
expected
bringing
the
drinkability
and
mouthfeel
ratings
way
up
for
the
style
and
the
alcohol
content
a
rich
cake
flavor
with
notes
of
molasses
chocolate
raisin
dried
apple
and
floral
hops
not
sugary
sweet
some
spice
notes
in
the
finish
would
love
to
have
aged
it
some
but
ill
start
with
a
raw
review
and
go
from
there
this
beer
poured
deep
brown
with
a
red
tint
and
2
fingers
of
head
there
were
carbonation
bubbles
coming
up
from
the
bottom
lace
is
minimal
the
aroma
is
mainly
of
sugar
and
fruit
the
taste
is
malty
and
creamy
it
is
very
sweet
and
complex
in
flavor
i
really
like
the
flavor
of
this
beer
but
i
cant
pull
out
any
distinctive
tastes
medium
bodied
beer
that
leaves
you
craving
for
another
very
rich
in
the
mouth
pushing
the
limit
of
acceptable
sweetness
for
me
its
quite
fruity
and
there
is
a
ton
of
rich
bready
malt
some
yeastiness
as
well
the
tiny
constant
streams
of
fine
carbonation
rising
throughout
the
pint
keep
it
from
being
ponderous
the
alcohol
is
a
readily
apparent
and
not
particularly
pleasant
component
of
the
palate
poured
out
a
raisin
colored
brown
with
a
nice
head
that
lingered
aroma
was
of
malt
and
a
hint
of
figs
taste
is
extraordinary
complex
and
layered
which
keeps
the
alcohol
from
taking
over
hints
of
fig
and
raisin
with
a
sugary
overtone
thats
quite
pleasing
malt
and
a
bit
of
hop
were
also
evident
simply
superb
easily
one
of
the
best
things
i
have
ever
tasted
will
return
again
and
again
all
in
all
we
thought
the
westy
was
better
based
mostly
on
its
smoothness
and
better
flavor
first
of
all
thedm
and
i
compared
this
to
the
westy
12
and
i
very
very
much
like
the
westy
12
over
this
brew
i
just
could
not
acquire
a
taste
for
this
brew
as
i
was
hoping
to
that
said
it
poured
a
large
invigorating
tan
head
with
finesmall
bubbles
into
my
glass
the
lacing
was
good
on
all
sides
of
my
glass
it
had
a
sweet
aroma
to
it
and
a
cloudy
brown
body
there
was
carbonation
observed
with
this
brew
it
kept
leaving
me
with
a
tingly
burning
sensation
in
my
throat
that
was
not
to
my
liking
give
me
a
westy
12
anyday
heres
one
of
those
dangerous
belgian
brews
this
one
pours
a
dark
ruby
color
with
a
sturdy
beige
head
that
laces
extremely
well
a
sweet
chocolate
aroma
presents
itself
as
notes
of
nuts
and
yeast
are
subdued
but
present
nevertheless
taste
is
sweet
nutty
yeasty
alcoholic
and
overall
delicious
mouthfeel
is
smooth
and
this
beer
is
very
well
balanced
for
a
beer
of
its
abv
this
one
drinks
way
too
easily
and
can
put
one
on
his
ass
if
he
is
not
careful
certainly
a
classic
and
well
worth
its
acclaim
this
was
a
great
drinking
experience
a
true
classic
of
the
beer
world
no
wonder
it
is
rated
high
primo
stuff
poured
it
into
a
fluted
glass
and
got
about
half
an
inch
of
head
that
went
away
quickly
some
floaties
very
dark
color
the
smell
is
strongto
go
with
the
alcohol
banana
plum
cocoa
medicine
all
present
in
nose
the
alcohol
is
not
real
prominent
surprisingly
only
a
little
warm
going
down
i
would
recommend
the
5258f
serving
temp
stated
on
the
bottle
only
a
little
carbonated
bite
really
wonderful
mouth
feel
fruit
malt
fig
or
plum
you
can
wait
for
several
minutes
between
sips
the
taste
sticks
around
there
are
very
few
beers
that
even
come
close
to
this
quality
and
enjoyment
price
is
the
only
hold
back
6
worth
it
for
a
special
treat
originally
sampled
11
march
2002
at
pizzaports
belgian
beerfest
on
draught
rochefort
10
is
a
world
class
wonderful
beer
the
explosion
of
flavors
in
your
mouth
arent
to
be
missed
it
has
very
light
hop
notes
but
the
plum
raisin
other
flavors
are
gorgeous
after
passing
this
by
numerous
times
because
of
the
price
i
finally
sprung
for
a
bottle
and
am
just
amazed
at
how
good
this
beer
is
the
head
foams
up
a
bit
fluffy
offwhite
and
looks
like
a
layer
of
pudding
sitting
on
top
of
the
beer
the
head
dimishes
a
bit
but
sticks
around
to
the
end
leaving
lace
all
the
way
down
the
glass
its
a
beautiful
deep
ruby
the
smell
is
ripe
fruit
most
notably
raisin
and
cherry
and
a
bit
of
spice
ripe
fruit
and
peppery
flavors
come
through
with
just
a
hint
of
licorice
the
mouthfeel
is
a
creamy
miracle
this
is
the
ultimate
sipping
beer
and
a
must
for
a
special
occasion
this
ale
poured
carefully
a
cloudy
dark
coffee
brown
with
highlights
of
red
with
thin
tan
foam
that
dissipated
rapidly
the
smell
was
vinous
and
fruity
figs
apples
with
caramel
sweet
malt
and
oak
thrown
in
there
was
also
an
alcohol
odor
discernible
though
not
strong
the
taste
was
mildly
sweet
vinous
and
fruity
apples
grapes
figs
raisins
with
malt
and
alcohol
flavors
the
flavors
blended
wonderfully
to
give
a
very
mellow
experience
the
mouthfeel
was
very
smooth
and
velvety
with
mediumfull
body
and
low
carbonation
the
flavors
lingered
in
the
mouth
the
drinkability
was
very
good
a
very
nice
strong
belgian
ale
this
is
a
huge
beer
the
flavor
is
all
over
the
place
with
lots
of
complexity
a
little
sweet
fruitiness
is
followed
by
a
good
smooth
flow
of
dark
malts
the
flavor
starts
to
get
roasty
towards
the
end
and
then
you
get
a
big
blast
of
alcohol
sometimes
the
alcohol
was
hidden
and
if
it
was
like
that
throughout
this
beer
would
have
scored
much
higher
i
tasted
a
whole
lot
of
alcohol
through
most
of
this
beer
it
was
not
welcomed
in
that
quantity
besides
that
this
is
an
excellent
beer
it
is
everything
you
would
want
from
a
belgian
dark
ale
full
bodied
with
a
great
aroma
and
masses
of
flavor
the
alcohol
warms
nicely
but
the
flavor
of
alcohol
needs
to
be
toned
down
f
what
else
can
be
said
i
was
told
that
this
is
the
closest
i
can
get
to
westvleteren
12
without
actually
having
it
and
if
so
im
really
looking
forward
to
it
manly
head
and
thick
mouthfeel
the
flavor
is
inexplicable
so
ill
let
others
try
you
pour
it
let
the
head
settle
a
bit
take
a
spicy
sip
stare
down
into
it
and
say
holy
shit
thank
you
belgium
drinkability
scary
for
the
amount
of
alcohol
this
brew
has
it
packs
a
wallop
yet
hides
it
until
the
end
i
could
drink
several
of
these
slowly
of
course
this
beer
is
so
easy
to
go
back
to
as
it
makes
you
content
in
its
taste
and
feeling
easily
a
beer
to
have
often
if
you
can
afford
it
so
simple
not
in
a
minimalist
way
but
in
a
straightforward
way
outstanding
tradition
and
elegant
simplicity
what
a
dark
malty
brew
can
be
at
its
best
things
just
keep
getting
heavier
deep
ruby
in
color
with
a
very
thin
densely
packed
dark
tan
head
aroma
is
of
burnt
malt
plum
sugar
and
alcohol
i
was
actually
a
bit
underwhelmed
by
the
aroma
after
sniffing
the
8
i
expected
something
even
bigger
from
the
10
it
would
have
been
a
nice
warning
of
what
to
expect
in
terms
of
flavor
once
again
the
alcohol
is
quite
noticeable
from
the
first
sip
and
thenwell
theres
a
lot
going
on
bready
body
tastes
of
molasses
pepper
raisin
and
plum
pear
and
banana
all
undergirded
by
a
solid
chocolatecaramel
maltiness
finishes
with
a
strong
hit
of
leafy
hop
flavor
thinner
in
body
than
i
had
expected
but
still
creamy
and
viscous
in
mouthfeel
not
to
be
trifled
with
pours
with
a
rapidly
fading
brown
head
over
murky
opaque
dark
brownish
liquid
the
nose
is
a
heady
mix
of
dark
fruits
chocolate
malts
and
alcohol
taste
is
a
wonderful
mix
of
candi
sugar
yeasty
fruitiness
hops
chocolate
and
a
massive
alcoholic
presence
that
just
coats
the
throat
as
you
swallow
this
complex
ale
finishes
with
a
complexity
rarely
tasted
in
most
ales
of
any
style
with
a
chocolatey
sweetness
that
gives
way
to
a
very
appetizing
dryness
that
begs
another
long
sip
one
of
belgiums
and
the
worlds
finest
beers
one
of
the
alltime
greats
worth
every
pricey
penny
way
too
drinkable
for
something
this
strong
this
beer
pours
a
slightly
hazy
coppery
brown
with
a
small
tan
head
it
has
a
sweet
cookie
like
peppery
smell
as
expected
extremely
complex
and
smooth
with
a
creamy
sherry
like
flavor
and
sharp
peppery
alcohol
warmth
with
a
very
rounded
full
mouthfeel
definitely
a
delicious
smooth
beer
more
akin
to
a
sherry
or
port
and
intended
to
be
savored
in
a
similar
manner
would
be
welcome
anytime
but
possibly
best
suited
as
an
after
dinner
drink
one
of
my
favorites
once
again
its
great
to
be
catholic
and
the
trappist
monks
do
it
again
this
stuff
is
really
amazing
i
really
cant
think
of
any
flaws
in
this
brew
i
guess
the
only
draw
back
is
the
high
price
of
8
a
bottle
as
soon
as
i
opened
the
bottle
i
noticed
the
vanilla
and
fruits
scent
in
it
one
thing
that
turned
me
on
was
the
sight
of
the
beautiful
dark
color
and
a
creamy
brown
head
the
head
was
supper
thick
at
first
but
subsided
into
a
filmlike
substance
the
taste
was
of
heavy
vanilla
fruit
nuts
and
a
hint
of
alcohol
taste
the
nutty
vanilla
taste
stays
around
for
a
while
after
you
swallow
and
leaves
a
little
tinge
on
the
tounge
i
really
like
this
brew
and
put
it
up
there
with
the
weste
12
if
you
have
it
in
your
area
give
it
a
go
its
well
worth
the
price
ultraripe
peach
and
fig
aroma
browntan

brown

medium
low

lots
of
lacing
an
explosion
of
flavor
with
maple
focus
flavor
and
the
richest
longest
finish
i
have
ever
experienced
wrapped
in
the
creamiest
texture
alcohol
slowly
but
elegantly
making
itself
known
can
i
sell
my
soul
in
exchange
for
a
life
supply
of
this
beer
source
premiergourmet
buffalo
ny
the
initial
sensation
to
me
after
my
first
taste
was
warming
the
alcohol
is
not
overly
powerful
in
the
taste
at
all
what
is
powerful
in
the
taste
is
pears
and
dried
fruits
i
didnt
notice
much
of
a
chocolate
taste
like
many
reviewers
have
mentioned
i
just
cant
believe
how
smooth
this
beer
is
for
the
amount
of
alcohol
in
it
this
is
the
finest
belgian
beer
i
have
had
yet
i
definitely
like
it
more
than
maudite
la
fin
du
monde
and
trois
pistoles
these
being
the
only
other
belgian
ales
i
have
tried
it
tastes
so
good
that
its
hard
to
drink
it
slow
which
is
a
good
idea
unless
you
want
to
be
overwhelmed
with
a
quick
inebriation
one
of
the
more
drinkable
big
beers
i
have
had
but
definitly
not
one
of
the
more
interesting
i
can
see
this
making
a
great
aged
beer
but
i
dont
see
it
as
one
of
the
top
beers
in
the
world
who
knows
maybe
an
aged
bottle
would
change
my
mind
this
beer
is
very
complex
and
wonderfully
balanced
with
layers
of
flavor
that
reveal
themselves
as
the
beer
warms
in
the
glass
it
really
is
a
delicacy
and
at
8
00
per
bottle
its
one
that
i
will
indulge
in
very
infrequently
overall
this
beer
was
excellent
pours
a
small
tight
head
that
fades
slowly
a
rich
mahogany
color
doesnt
hide
the
sediment
that
snuck
into
the
glass
the
grass
like
aroma
lets
me
know
to
expect
a
strong
brew
buttery
toffee
flavor
rides
the
malty
goodness
and
with
a
hint
of
wood
it
gives
a
full
mouthfeel
the
11
3
is
there
from
begining
to
end
but
not
over
powering
a
masterpiece
of
a
beer
a
absolute
treat
one
of
the
true
greatshas
the
perfect
blend
of
malt
and
bitterness
tastes
of
fruit
and
spice
alcohol
not
that
noticable
in
taste
but
definitely
in
effect
two
of
these
and
it
will
be
sleepy
time
i
had
this
after
a
st
bernardus
12
and
i
definitely
prefered
the
rochefort
overall
this
is
a
unique
and
incredible
beer
this

the
head
leaves
a
beautiful
lace
pattern
on
the
glass
tha
aroma
is
dried

alcohol
and
background

the
taste
starts
off
with
a
rich
malty
flavor
that
is
well
balanced
with
flavors
of
dried
cherries
and
plums
the
finish
is
very
flowery
and
dry

being
the

the

with
malty
sweetness
and
faint
notes
of
raisin
the
mouthfeel
is
smooth
and
silky
with
just
the
right
amount
of
carbonation
this
is
one
of
the
worlds
greatest
beers
smooth
easy
to
drink
and
one
of
the
most
complex
of
the
trappist
beers
if
you
get
the
chance
to
try
one
of
these
do
it
at

i
will
have
another
one
this
beer
poured
a
very
dark
brown
color
and
formed
an
light

head
that
left
some
lace
an
aroma
of

and
spice
a
flavor
of
malt
and
spice
with
some
fruit
element
plus
you
can
detect
the
presence
of
the
alcohol
and
its
warming
effect
comes
through
in
a
tart
finish
that
hints
at
heavy
carbonation
being
present
this
is
by
far
the
best
of
the
three
of
theirs
that
i
have
tried
thanks
again
to
the
ohio
lawmakers
for
letting
us
get
this

chocolate
and

are
the
dominants
of
the
flavour
of
this

with
a
very
persistant
and
lacy

aroma
of

and
chocolate
oh
and
a
whole
lot
of
alochol
almost
reminds
me
of
brandy
flavor
is
very
heavily
dominated
by
the
alcohol
with
some
fruity
flavors
and
a
touch
of
chocolate
coming
through
sweet
and
tart
but
not
at
all
cloying
or
overstated
mouthfeel
is
light
to
medium
with
a
lot
of
effervescence
this
beer
is
just
loaded
with
carbonation
and
fills
the
mouth
like
a
champagne
this
is
a
very
good
and
unique
brew
not
quite
the
pinnacle
of
beer
excellence
but
definatley
a
very
good
beer

where
has

been

gusler
you
chump
the
finish
is
pertinently
hopped
as
do
most
of
the
belgian
andor
dark
ales
ive
tried
the
mouthfeel
after
swallowing
this
beer
reminded
me
of
whiskey
or
even
a
strong
wine
something
keeps
me
coming
back
to
rochefort
then
are
promptly
ensued
by
deeply
caramelized
fruit
notes
reminescent
of
sugary
prunes

dates
a
combination
of

special
b
and
chocolate
malt
surfaces
late
as
well
as
a
big
chunk
of
fresh
bubblegum
the
body
is
lightmedium
and
it
has
a
somewhat
zesty
mothfeel
the
flavor
is
expansive
with
a
silky
creamy
and
tan
this
beer
has
a
beautiful
aroma
dark
fruits
carmel
powerful
at
the
beginning
and
end
there
are
some
belgian
brews
that
rub
me
the
wrong
way
and
many
that
dont
plums
henderson
gwynn
do
its
a
classic
o
this
is
definitely
a
sipper
that
drinks
more
like
a
dessert
port
this
would
be
a
fine
choice
for
an
after
dinner
drink
i
am

the

grape
carries
over
to
the
flavor
mixing
with
some
sweet
malt
dark
molasses
and
cola
unexpected
for
a
quad

very
solid
and
easy
to

overall
kasteel
donker
forms
an
integral
part
of
one
of
my
favourite
beers
kasteel

so
it
was
interesting
to
get
the
opportunity
to
try
it
on
its
own
i
think
ill
stick
to
the
cherrified
version
donker
on
its
own
is
just
too
damned
heavy
and
sweet
for
my
personal
tastes
as
an
every
now
and
again
thing
this
makes
a
nice
change
and
hell
you
cant
beat
a
good
quadrupel

its
hard
going

with
little
or
no
head
promising
a
boozy
belgian
quad
smelled
like
raisins
currants
and
dark
sticky
fruit
in
general
tasted
like
a
tawny
port
rich
sweet
and
booze
on
the
front
fading
to
fruit
on
the
finish
had
a
silky
smooth
feel
perfect
for
the
sweet
alcohol
overall
one
of
the
best
most
balanced
beers
ive
tried
even
if
one
of
the
sweetest
this
is
a
sweet
tooth
beer
and
i
dont
really
have
a
sweet
tooth
pours
a
dark
brown
with
a
hint
of
read
in
there
nice
head
but
it
dissipated
quickly
and
there
was
no
lacing
on
the
glass
the
smell
jumps
out
as
you
pour
the
dark
fruits
are
the
first
thing
you
notice
mostly
raisin
there
seems
to
be
a
little
cherry
and
definitely
the
candy
you
pick
up
a
hint
of
the
alcohol
in
the
smell
then
the
taste
wow
unbelievable
taste
is
similar
to
smell
but
bigger
and
even
more
complex
it
is
very
sweet
up
front
you
get
the
candy
and
the
raisin
is
what
i
would
call
thick
but
not
out
of
whack
i
still
am
getting
the
cherry
kinda
like
wine
which
i
almost
never
drink
so
could
not
quantify
and
something
along
the
carameltoffee
that
i
cant
make
out
although
maybe
just
the
candy
that
comes
across
creamy
the
alcohol
is
there
but
you
do
not
notice
it
until
you
think
about
it
extremely
tasty
complex
but
oddly
it
all
works
it
is
sticky
in
you
mouth
almost
syrupy
but
it
really
works
you
are
licking
the
sweetness
of
your
lips
outstanding
overall
this
was
an
extremely
interesting
and
quality
quad
that
i
am
shocked
is
not
getting
more
pub
good
day
and
it
was
a
victory
beer
victory
is
good
too
sweet
mouth
full
of
sweetnes
taste
is
much
too
sweet
bottled
on
june
21
2012
pretty
tasty
overall
very
impressed
i
love
a
good
quad
and
this
is
up
there
with
the
top
tier
i
dont
like
my
beers
to
be
so
sweet
but
it
was
done
in
a
good
way
and
i
learnt
to
love
it
while
sipping
had
no
problem
in
downing
75
cl
and
i
would
definitely
have
this
nectar
again
to
get
deeper
in
its
complexities
an
outstanding
specimen
of
a
belgian
ale
overall
a
very
solid
off
the
radar
quad
but
just
a
bit
too
sweet
for
my
tastes
overall
super
great
i
couldnt
imagine
something
better
to
drink
during
a
long
northern
european
winter
final
thoughts
all
in
all
i
was
kinda
a
bit
disappointed
by
it
i
think
part
of
the
reason
is
i
saw
donker
and
thought
dunkel
and
was
expecting
something
richer
and
bitter
then
something
this
light
and
sweet
its
ok
but
i
get
the
feeling
quads
are
the
malt
version
of
ipa
meaning
too
much
of
one
aspect
of
the
beer
dominating
the
others
overall
a
really
good
beer
although
in
my
opinion
not
as
good
as
golden
draak
at
11
it
is
not
to
be
trifled
with
you
had
better
treat
this
one
like
a
trappist
beer
and
leave
it
to
one
bottle
a
day
it
hits
you
first
at
the
back
of
the
tongue
and
it
is
definitely
quite
sweet
i
find
it
quite
similar
to
toffee
but
beyond
that
there
is
not
much
to
say
if
you
like
them
sweet
then
this
is
a
good
beer
for
you
poured
from
a
bottle
into
a
kasteel
goblet
at
taste
of
belgium
in
palm
beach
aruba
pours
a
dark
reddish
brown
with
only
the
slightest
creamy
ivory
head
it
dissipates
quickly
leaving
minimal
lacing
the
aroma
reminds
me
of
prune
but
the
sweetness
is
very
evident
in
the
nose
the
taste
follows
the
aroma
prunes
plum
and
raisins
with
lots
of
caramel
sweetness
medium
mouth
but
the
way
it
slides
off
the
tongue
gives
it
a
light
feel
its
certainly
different
from
the
other
quads
ive
tried
but
it
is
so
very
good
i
wish
i
could
find
this
one
closer
to
home
overall
only
barely
avoids
being
cloying
the
lack
of
suds
or
balance
to
provide
a
break
from
the
sweetness
hurts
the
beers
potential
teetering
on
the
edge
of
being
a
very
good
brew
its
difficult
to
finish
the
bottle
on
tap
i
admit
it
i
go
for
the
sweet
and
this
has
all
the
angles
going
for
it
as
long
as
youre
on
the
sweet
not
white
sugar
sweet
but
that
raisiny
sweet
dates
sweet
kind
of
but
not
really
that
dried
fruity
sweet
im
on
that
in
a
minute
as
long
as
there
is
of
depth
of
flavor
i
dont
want
to
tarnish
or
enhance
the
experience
with
words
that
may
be
misinterperted
so
ill
just
say
if
you
like
deep
serious
flavors
have
the
time
to
savour
make
this
the
one
so
stop
reading
this
order
the
damn
thing
already
very
complex
and
also
sweet
quad
this
seems
to
age
well
and
it
works
perfectly
as
a
dessert
beer
you
wouldnt
drink
a
second
bottle
call
it
a
sleeping
pill
or
night
cap
overall
i
am
only
saddened
that
i
have
not
bought
this
sooner
makes
my
fav
list
for
sure
o
this
quad
is
definitely
on
the
sweeter
side
with
a
unassuming
punch
that
finishes
as
strong
as
it
starts
it
may
be
a
touch
too
sweet
to
make
it
an
ideal
quad
for
my
taste
buds
but
the
deep
multitude
of
flavours
still
make
this
a
solid
beer
overall
a
very
fine
quad
maybe
not
quite
in
the
westy
12
and
rochefort
10
league
but
eminently
enjoyable
and
at
all
times
a
serious
beer
that
is
to
be
respected
and
enjoyed
would
gladly
pick
up
another
especially
at
the
current
price
in
ontario
o
this
bottle
was
aged
for
3
yrs
and
i
must
say
i
reeeally
love
this
stuff
ive
had
other
bottles
of
varying
yearsage
and
this
one
was
the
best
simply
outstanding
as
a
stand
alone
or
a
dessert
beer
i
would
not
say
that
this
is
a
whole
bottle
in
one
sitting
beer
best
shared
with
a
friend
overall
abv
is
well
hidden
and
it
tastes
a
little
like
a
barley
wine
in
some
ways
id
like
a
little
more
dark
fruit
flavour
rather
than
the
cola
notes
but
this
is
still
an
excellent
brew
just
a
little
one
dimensional
curious
to
see
how
this
ages
enjoy
o
i
would
say
this
beer
was
a
sleeper
for
me
i
wasnt
expecting
what
i
got
at
all
while
i
know
some
would
call
it
a
touch
sweet
i
liked
the
dark
fruit
profile
a
great
deal
if
you
like
big
belgians
i
think
you
will
like
this
the
top
of
the
2nd
tier
of
quads
beer
is
heavybodied
with
carbonation
of
medium
to
mediumlow
intensity
resulting
in
a
smooth
13
and
otherwise
foamy
23
mouthfeel
that
suits
the
beer
and
the
style
quite
well
ethanol
felt
as
heat
in
the
nostrils
and
low
burn
on
the
palate
and
back
of
throat
not
surprising
for
an
11
abv
beer
fairly
wellintegrated
into
the
overall
package
closes
dry
with
heavy
stickiness
on
the
palate
and
lips
o
perhaps
too
sweet
and
cloying
there
are
fascinating
notes
of
apple
peel
raisin
and
prune
but
you
wouldnt
want
to
drink
too
much
of
it
quickly
i
love
this
beer
phenomenal
for
its
own
level
of
sweetness
always
a
good
choice
4
25
thick
almost
dirty
appearance
like
freshly
stomped
grapes
with
all
the
residue
that
goes
with
it
strong
smell
of
fig
reminds
me
of
the
fig
newtons
i
loved
as
a
kid
you
can
also
catch
a
hint
of
alcohol
in
the
nose
not
surprising
considering
the
high
abv
11
nothing
tame
about
the
aroma
wow
tastes
of
grapes
fig
sweet
caramel
and
a
little
alcohol
bite
sweet
and
fruity
after
taste
mouthfeel
like
a
high
gravity
squeezed
fruit
drink
very
full
bodied
overall
this
is
about
as
good
as
it
gets
for
a
quad
i
didnt
think
i
would
find
one
better
than
trappistes
rochefort
10
but
this
one
is
tops
it
in
my
book
a
little
pricey
at
about
19
for
a
four
pack
but
well
worth
it
who
cares
if
this
wasnt
a
session
beer
youll
want
more
than
one
in
a
sitting
anyways
i
had
the
11
2
oz
bottle
that
didnt
even
expire
until
january
but
that
was
more
than
enough
to
get
a
feel
for
this
not
all
quads
are
created
equal
and
the
spice
and
heavy
mouthfeel
werent
present
here
what
resulted
was
a
beer
that
would
be
a
dessert
until
itself
unassumingly
shoving
dinner
aside
in
the
process
a
musthave
for
anyone
who
love
belgian
beers
without
the
seriousness
underneath
the
surface
really
fabulous
take
on
the
style
sweet
smell
typical
of
belgian
quads
tastes
of
dried
dark
fruit
such
as
plums
raisins
and
dates
thick
and
syrupy
that
is
a
beer
that
takes
a
lot
of
time
to
finish
the
11
percent
abv
is
noticeable
with
the
smell
of
alcohol
also
the
taste
of
alcohol
is
present
at
the
finish
similar
to
a
glass
of
wine
otherwise
the
finish
was
excellent
you
can
also
notice
the
legs
on
the
glass
when
finished
this
beer
is
in
a
class
of
its
own
i
dont
know
what
class
but
never
had
anything
like
it
super
nice
quad
that
pours
a
thick
ruby
black
taste
like
a
pissed
off
chocolate
cake
smells
like
honey
and
brown
sugar
how
the
11
is
hidden
so
well
i
will
never
know
mouthfeel
is
creamy
but
a
bit
awkward
like
a
junior
prom
tongue
kiss
behind
the
first
base
dugout
but
unforgettable
just
the
same
this
damn
beer
is
so
sweet
and
strong
i
dont
know
what
to
do
with
this
pours
an
almost
opaque
crimsonbrown
with
a
foamy
dark
khaki
head
that
settles
to
wisps
of
film
on
top
of
the
beer
small
streaks
of
lace
form
around
the
glass
on
the
drink
down
smell
is
of
malt
dark
fruit
spice
and
alcohol
aromas
taste
is
much
the
same
with
super
sweet
dark
fruit
and
alcohol
flavors
on
the
finish
there
is
a
mild
amount
of
spice
bitterness
on
the
palate
with
each
sip
this
beer
has
a
lower
level
of
carbonation
with
a
slightly
crisp
and
sticky
mouthfeel
overall
this
is
a
pretty
good
beer
but
its
very
sweet
and
sugary
even
for
the
style
did
not
score
a
t
s
m
at
that
time
disregard
those
scores
poured
from
a
11
5
oz
bottle
that
was
bottle
on
jan
25
2012
the
color
was
a
cocoa
black
with
minimal
head
as
poured
into
my
liberated
pub
glass
the
aroma
was
pleasant
with
only
a
slight
knod
to
the
11
abv
first
taste
revealed
hints
of
dark
chocolate
caramel
and
figs
but
surprisingly
little
alcoholic
bite
this
is
a
very
smooth
beverage
it
is
a
tad
heavy
so
like
another
poster
suggested
this
would
not
be
a
good
choice
for
a
summer
bbq
however
a
perfect
choice
for
later
on
world
class
all
the
way
pairs
very
well
with
barbecue
chicken
pizza
and
hot
wings
enough
said
o
quite
sweet
for
the
style
but
very
good
id
enjoy
a
bit
more
yeast
character
as
well
either
way
a
nice
quad
it
is
a
dark
sweet
beer
not
something
i
might
drink
on
a
hot
afternoon
however
in
the
evening
this
is
my
favorite
beer
heavy
filling
unique
i
have
never
had
a
beer
quite
like
this
one
this
beer
is
like
port
is
to
wine
it
is
a
beer
with
a
different
unique
flavor
that
is
great
to
finish
off
an
evening
with
belgium
classic
on
tap
at
kickbacks
in
jax
poured
into
a
snifter
beige
head
on
a
hazy
deep
tudor
brown
body
soapy
lacing
sticks
to
the
glass
aroma
includes
candi
sugar
brown
sugar
dates
overripe
banana
some
alcohol
and
raisins
mouthfeel
is
thick
tongue
coating
tasting
notes
are
similar
to
the
aroma
although
the
alcohol
is
not
noted
on
tasting
very
nice
quad
as
expected
from
kasteel
i
had
to
give
it
4
5s
across
the
board
its
got
its
ups
and
downs
but
this
is
an
enigma
this
is
special
this
a
quad
and
quads
are
complex
i
dont
have
the
patience
to
evaluate
most
quads
i
just
appreciate
the
ability
to
drink
it
and
the
high
abv
im
a
lush
eh
what
more
can
you
expect
from
me
it
all
comes
out
here
and
now
i
think
i
need
a
good
stout
after
this
od
very
little
alcohol
which
is
surprising
for
the
abv
a
tad
sweet
otherwise
quite
nice
warms
up
to
become
nice
and
smooth
doesnt
break
the
mold
but
definitely
does
the
trick
taste
is
not
quite
as
complex
as
the
aroma
but
is
wonderful
full
wellrounded
and
approachable
despite
the
richness
and
strength
it
has
sweetspicy
dried
fruits
ginger
cake
port
sweeter
up
front
but
a
slightly
direr
finish
of
dark
toast
and
dried
fig
it
is
not
extremely
complex
but
has
some
complexity
and
a
nicely
wellrounded
character
feel
is
firm
with
a
hint
of
oiliness
but
also
a
bit
lively
and
it
is
not
heavy
or
truly
oily
much
less
viscous
the
high
abv
is
hinted
at
in
the
portlike
element
but
otherwise
the
boozy
alcoholic
quality
is
nicely
restrained
adding
an
enriching
warmth
without
making
the
booziness
overtly
noticeable
much
less
harsh
in
any
way
a
quad
that
can
stand
among
the
elite
abbey
and
trappist
quads
of
the
world
330ml

poured
into
leffe
chalice
dark
with
auburn
edges
almost
opaque
a
small
tanned
head
bursted
out
towards
the
end
of
the
pour
but
it
faded
straight
away
initially
the
yeasty
cranberry
aroma
was
weak
but
it
got
stronger
as
the
beer
warmed
tasted
brown
sugar
cranberry
cherry
yeast
and
molasses
finish
was
delayed
and
had
a
biscuity
edge
to
it
there
was
also
a
slight
burn
from
the
booze
had
an
initial
prickly
edge
from
the
carbonation
smooth
texture
light
bodied
for
the
strength
i
liked
how
it
hid
the
booze
need
to
explore
a
few
more
strong
dark
belgian
ales
before
i
can
really
give
a
good
judgement
on
this
bottle
from
belgian
beer
shop
very
beautiful
dark
red
brown
colour
thick
creamy
beige
head
that
lasts
very
well
the
aroma
is
malty
dark
fruits
sweet
clear
alcohol
presence
candy
sugar
sweet
vinous
creamy
malty
heart
warming
very
complex
super
beer
o
damn
good
quad
up
there
with
the
best
nice
balance
hides
the
abv
away
without
a
trace
the
beer
is
chestnut
brown
with
crimson
highlights
sporting
nearly
an
inch
of
beige
head
the
aroma
offers
dark
fruits
yeast
malt
alcohol
brown
sugar
the
taste
follows
suit
with
the
11
abv
well
hidden
sweet
but
not
cloying
thick
body
with
moderate
carbonation
palate
coating
and
a
tad
syrupy
notes
of
nuts
clever
alliteration
nest
pas
perhaps
almonds
brown
sugar
spices
perhaps
nutmeg
a
solid
quad
i
would
definitely
have
this
again
overall
greatbigbeer
strong
and
sweet
i
would
drink
a
few
of
the
these
over
the
colder
months
as
it
sits
it
is
quite
pleasent
in
warm
weather
only
as
long
as
you
dont
excert
yourself
the
11
abv
also
puts
an
upper
boundary
on
this
beers
drinkability
for
me
o
this
is
the
first
beer
i
have
drank
of
this
style
but
overall
i
am
impressed
for
a
beer
with
11
abv
aside
from
its
high
level
of
sweetness
almost
too
sweet
for
my
personal
taste
it
is
very
easy
to
drink
a
little
added
carbonation
may
help
balance
out
the
sweetness
but
that
is
just
a
small
note
to
make
in
comparison
to
the
many
qualities
this
beer
contains
had
this
on
my
belgian
beer
tour
at
a
little
bar
in
brugerecommended
by
a
local
it
poured
a
dark
rich
color
with
a
minimal
head
and
very
little
lace
i
tend
to
prefer
golden
beers
but
this
was
a
delicious
dark
beer
it
had
a
lightness
and
sweetness
to
it
that
i
was
not
expecting
originally
reviewed
11012010
picked
up
in
southern
spain
750
ml
bottle
with
a
best
by
date
of
july
2016
poured
into
my
wine
glass
and
it
had
a
minimal
head
very
much
a
dark
fruity
small
and
taste
not
much
head
but
it
was
light
brown
head
and
did
lace
slightly
deep
brown
almost
ruby
color
lots
of
fig
cherry
sweet
dark
fruit
taste
definitely
a
sipper
and
some
warming
from
the
alcohol
very
heavy
beer
and
coats
the
mouth
and
throat
overall
a
splendid
quadruple
dark
belgian
and
will
consider
packing
a
few
when
i
leave
spain
and
will
continue
to
stock
this
see
you
on
the
next
one
what
a
wonderful
beer
it
is
like
drinking
a
nice
glass
of
port
its
definitely
a
sipper
and
not
the
easiest
beer
to
drink
and
i
think
it
could
use
a
bit
more
carbonation
to
help
stimulate
the
palate
but
that
doesnt
take
away
from
its
great
qualities
i
wouldnt
suggest
this
to
someone
new
to
beers
of
this
caliber
it
has
a
lot
of
complexity
and
a
lot
of
power
yes
i
can
give
this
beer
a
lower
rating
than
4
for
taste
it
is
just
way
too
sweet
o
splendid
although
somewhat
sweet
quad
alcohol
was
present
but
surprisingly
did
not
end
up
being
a
detraction
lots
of
complexity
and
still
incredibly
smooth
o
tastes
like
sweet
raisins
if
you
like
that
sort
of
thing
this
might
be
your
beer
this
is
one
of
the
best
beers
ive
ever
had
the
one
i
had
was
part
of
a
belgian
sampler
and
i
went
out
the
next
day
and
bought
a
whole
case
price
point
4
7911
2
oz
bottle
furthermore
an
above
average
beer
but
not
really
special
among
the
best
tasting
substances
to
ever
come
from
a
bottle
a
perfect
quad
m
complex
sensations
that
starts
neutral
with
some
sweetness
that
rapidly
changes
into
bittersweetness
and
then
bitterness
at
the
end
not
too
hard
on
the
mouth
but
present
and
also
the
alcohol
sensation
hits
almost
at
the
same
time
alcohol
is
well
concealed
dont
feel
it
much
in
both
aroma
and
flavor
indeed
a
worthy
pick
wow
tremendous
treat
here
if
you
are
even
remotely
interested
in
belgian
ales
you
must
pick
this
up
if
you
see
it
overall
best
quad
ive
tried
yet
complete
package
o
an
excellent
sipper
cant
take
more
than
a
baby
sip
because
its
so
complex
and
sweet
its
not
something
you
could
have
a
lot
of
high
alcohol
and
incredibly
unique
flavor
experience
good
stuff
however
i
would
only
want
one
once
a
year
waay
to
rich
to
be
an
all
the
time
beer
on
hand
i
am
no
fan
generally
speaking
of
quads
this
quad
is
a
bit
sweet
but
somehow
stays
in
balance
and
is
not
overwhelming
nice
looking
beer
the
belgian
yeast
comes
through
with
a
smooth
light
tasting
nuttiness
that
moves
toward
the
cherryplum
taste
very
drinkable
not
much
alcohol
detected
lightly
delicate
with
nice
lacing
out
of
the
tulip
extremely
nice
beer
better
than
i
remembered
it
when
i
had
it
around
6
years
ago
a
truly
great
beer
poured
in
a
goblet
to
facilitate
taste
and
smell
it
developed
a
nice
half
inch
head
dissipating
slowly
i
sniffed
it
for
the
first
time
getting
a
strong
scent
of
caramel
and
detected
a
subtle
hoppy
background
i
tasted
this
brew
and
my
palate
detected
flavors
of
caramel
toffee
and
fruity
complex
flavors
like
guava
this
brew
is
sweeti
like
the
after
taste
and
honestly
i
want
to
drink
more
and
remember
folks
to
support
your
local
brewery
drink
beer
hog
in
short
if
you
like
bockstyle
beers
this
is
definintely
one
to
try
and
enjoy
this
is
my
kind
of
brew
especially
for
this
time
of
year
where
it
is
currently
32
degrees
outside
this
definitely
will
warm
you
up
a
bit
a
nice
steady
drinking
brew
not
one
to
be
sessioned
but
rather
enjoyed
with
a
chill
in
the
air
o
an
excellent
beer
always
good
to
have
a
few
on
youre
shelf
i
picked
mine
up
at
the
total
wine
and
more
about
20
miles
away
for
14
99
4
12oz
but
ill
be
back
for
more
and
more
relax
baby
ill
fill
you
with
money
and
keep
you
happy
the
mouth
needs
more
carbonation
but
i
recon
the
aging
may
have
toned
this
department
down
a
bit
too
much
i
dont
think
cellaring
this
one
helped
it
much
medium
body
and
not
as
smooth
going
down
as
the
best
ive
had
in
this
style
the
noted
lack
of
head
comes
through
in
the
mouthfeel
its
not
bad
but
lacks
some
of
the
pillowiness
id
have
hoped
for
really
a
touch
of
co2
is
all
that
is
missing
from
making
this
a
world
beater
of
course
it
did
travel
some
route
to
get
from
belgium
to
anchorage
and
who
knows
how
that
went
for
it
there
is
alot
of
good
here
no
matter
how
you
slice
it
the
flavor
in
this
sweet
quad
is
superb
fantastic
for
a
sweet
belgian
bruin
like
a
gouden
carolus
sweet
food
pairing
brings
out
apple
perhaps
prunish
tartness
d
one
of
the
best
quads
i
have
tasted
end
of
story
at
the
risk
of
sounding
prudent
the
donker
is
sweet
indulgence
at
11
abv
like
a
still
life
from
the
dutch
mastersit
is
deep
dark
and
decadent
sinful
pouring
over
with
color
and
life
and
like
the
masters
its
imbalance
is
overt
with
opulence
overbearing
from
the
deep
leaving
me
searching
for
a
bit
of
light
in
its
darkest
corners
o
this
is
another
very
solid
beer
from
kasteel
and
recommended
overall
quite
smooth
for
the
abv
will
age
well
i
should
keep
other
bottle
for
a
few
more
years
a
bit
too
sweet
and
has
an
annoying
alcohol
bite
i
was
served
this
beer
at
a
small
bar
in
brussels
belgium
i
am
a
huge
lover
of
dark
beers
and
was
really
excited
to
try
this
it
was
poured
in
the
proper
glassware
and
had
a
very
nice
mahogany
color
to
it
i
got
about
a
12
of
head
to
it
which
receded
fairly
quickly
the
smell
was
surprisingly
sweet
i
was
expecting
more
of
a
subdued
earthy
scent
but
this
smelled
almost
like
cherry
cough
syrup
the
first
sip
yielded
more
of
the
cough
syrup
taste
but
as
i
let
it
roll
around
in
my
mouth
a
bit
i
tasted
more
of
a
molassesbrown
sugar
hint
honestly
i
feel
as
though
this
is
a
good
beer
but
it
is
hard
for
me
to
get
past
the
cough
syrup
taste
of
it
c
poured
a
dark
semihazy
brown
with
just
a
bit
of
head
that
receded
to
a
film
of
bubbles
caramel
malts
and
peppery
spice
in
the
aroma
and
distinct
alcohol
similar
taste
with
sweet
malts
and
belgian
sugar
slight
molasses
and
some
dark
fruits
also
noticeable
not
as
much
spice
as
i
detected
in
the
aroma
mediumheavy
body
with
some
carbonation
pretty
drinkable
but
a
bit
strong
o
what
a
great
beer
complex
easy
to
get
and
affordable
make
this
a
great
quad
overall
nothing
i
have
ever
drank
before
with
an
11
abv
has
been
smoother
truly
a
wonderfully
crafted
beer
aroma
is
malty
with
caramel
and
bread
hints
and
a
noticeable
alcohol
nip
it
pours
a
dark
slightly
hazy
mahogany
with
a
thick
fairly
persistent
pale
tan
head
flavor
is
malty
and
surprisingly
sweet
having
tones
of
honey
caramel
and
toffee
in
addition
to
the
malt
alcohol
bite
is
more
subtle
than
in
the
aroma
texture
is
fairly
smooth
and
fizzy
leaving
behind
a
soft
but
persistent
tingle
finish
is
sweet
but
not
cloying
and
has
a
nice
alcohol
nip
to
it
as
drinkable
as
any
11
quad
is
ever
going
to
be
this
beer
exhibits
absolutely
amazing
balance
and
does
everything
right
it
also
reminds
me
exactly
which
country
first
awakened
me
to
the
vast
possibilities
of
beer
time
to
refocus
my
buying
habits
toward
belgium
again
this
is
superb
poured
a
clear
dark
brown
with
a
small
light
brown
creamy
head
that
disappeared
very
quickly
and
had
fair
lacing
the
aroma
was
of
nutty
dark
malts
and
a
horse
blanket
scented
yeast
with
notes
of
brown
sugar
raisons
and
dried
fruit
it
tasted
sweet
rich
and
malty
with
hints
of
brown
sugar
at
the
start
but
matured
into
a
nice
sweetsour
yeasty
flavor
with
notes
of
dried
fruit
at
the
end
that
left
the
flavor
lasting
an
average
duration
on
the
taste
buds
mouthfeel
was
medium
in
body
and
nice
and
creamy
in
texture
overall
a
very
interesting
brew
sweet
yet
bold
in
flavor
which
did
a
great
job
of
concealing
the
high
alcohol
content
one
definitely
worth
trying
again
d
this
was
my
ultimate
beer
then
somehow
its
qualities
were
not
as
good
as
they
once
were
i
noticed
on
the
label
that
it
no
longer
seems
to
be
re
fermented
in
the
bottle
and
it
is
noticeable
which
is
why
i
have
given
it
lower
marks
than
i
would
have
liked
still
a
mighty
barleywine
that
will
keep
you
good
company
whilst
reading
a
bed
time
book
absolutely
a
beautiful
beer
pours
a
ruby
red
with
a
small
head
that
lays
on
top
throughout
the
aroma
is
fruity
with
raisins
and
grapes
maybe
some
plums
the
taste
is
sweet
with
the
fruits
coming
through
a
very
nice
burn
develops
as
it
warms
the
finish
is
quite
lingering
and
very
nice
warming
all
the
way
this
is
a
sipping
on
a
cold
night
type
of
beer
not
designed
for
tailgating
drinkability
i
will
not
have
this
one
again
1998
vintage
knowing
i
really
dont
like
this
beer
fresh
waaay
too
sweet
with
sharp
alcohol
i
was
very
curious
popping
this
bottle
poured
into
a
kasteel
beer
glass
the
beer
pours
a
dark
brown
colour
with
no
head
smell
is
very
sweet
dark
fruits
figs
plums
and
the
typical
vintage
smell
taste
is
still
sweetbut
much
less
strong
than
the
fresh
one
plums
figscandy
sugar
this
beer
is
so
balancedit
is
incredible
very
soft
mouthfeelno
sharpness
at
all
liquid
silk
reminds
me
of
a
good
porto
one
of
the
best
vintage
beers
i
ever
had
once
again
this
is
my
first
foray
into
belgian
ales
two
friends
had
different
bottles
of
delirium
at
the
same
time
and
after
tasting
the
other
two
i
will
say
that
i
liked
this
one
the
most
i
have
to
agree
with
lordadmnelson
i
dont
know
if
i
must
have
got
a
bad
bottle
myself
but
this
did
not
taste
like
beer
this
tasted
like
a
cheaper
bottle
of
champagne
smells
like
over
sweetened
champagne
and
the
abundance
of
carbonation
would
lead
me
to
believe
this
was
just
a
bottle
of
extra
sweet
champagne
the
aroma
is
of
grapes
definitely
no
scent
of
hops
malt
or
barley
when
poured
the
color
was
a
golden
yellow
and
did
not
look
too
bad
but
mixed
with
the
overly
strong
taste
of
stale
grapes
that
severely
impacted
my
score
which
is
a
total
shame
since
i
paid
9
99
for
a
big
bottle
very
very
disappointing
poured
a
murky
brown
with
minimal
head
nose
is
all
phenols
and
a
fake
grapeyness
gross
taste
is
the
same
this
oversweet
fake
awful
grape
note
feel
is
fine
drinkability
is
zero
awful
awful
awful
drainpour
overall
an
enjoyable
warming
beer
or
nightcap
i
am
glad
i
tried
this
beer
give
me
this
one
on
a
cold
night
sitting
in
front
of
a
fire
its
definitely
a
great
brew
one
of
my
top
three
beers
slight
oaky
smell
sweetness
is
there
at
first
and
all
the
way
through
no
bitterness
at
all
at
the
right
temperature
sort
of
reminds
me
of
a
flat
coke
in
a
good
way
so
smooth
rich
and
full
very
sweet
and
rich
very
drinkable
with
a
wonderful
mouthfeel
flavors
of
roasted
malts
are
most
noticeable
as
they
sweep
over
the
tongue
dark
dried
fruits
such
as
figs
raisins
and
plums
reveal
themselves
in
the
center
the
creamy
long
finish
brings
out
the
most
of
this
rich
brew
doh
boy
the
abv
on
this
one
comes
in
to
play
a
better
one
of
this
style
that
ive
had
and
i
truly
do
want
to
have
this
again
not
an
easy
drinker
but
definitely
a
happy
drinker
great
taste
sweet
smell
and
sweet
in
the
mouth
this
is
a
well
balanced
top
fermented
beer
dark
sugars
i
did
not
fell
in
love
with
this
one
some
interesting
characteristics
but
overall
it
is
too
sweet
for
my
taste
jd
d
its
a
respectable
quadruple
for
sure
but
this
10
ounces
cost
me
11
and
at
that
price
i
expect
to
be
gobsmacked
with
pure
deliciousness
on
this
front
sadly
kasteel
did
not
deliver
donker
is
a
funny
name
mediumplusborderline
full
bodied
mouthfeel
with
adequate
carbonation
i
wouldnt
mind
having
this
again
in
the
future
but
as
far
as
this
sitting
is
concerned
i
can
see
the
750
bottle
wearing
on
me
soon
d
this
is
a
very
tasty
quadrupel
it
is
certainly
worth
a
try
especially
on
tap
d
hard
to
answer
one
is
very
nice
i
wouldnt
have
two
two
would
be
awful
for
a
nice
dessert
i
think
this
is
wonderful
but
just
one
d
this
was
a
solid
dark
belgian
ale
with
a
very
sweet
character
it
had
great
body
and
the
alcohol
wasnt
bad
even
though
it
was
noticeable
so
it
was
easy
to
drink
great
candidate
for
aging
but
also
enjoyable
fresh
really
interesting
beer
and
id
like
to
try
others
from
this
brewery
what
a
great
beer
i
only
wish
that
the
year
was
as
good
as
its
first
beer
this
is
one
sweet
muuhfuuh
definitely
a
sipper
but
its
delicious
and
interesting
enough
to
keep
you
going
d
i
find
this
beer
a
bit
too
sweet
for
my
taste
i
may
be
able
to
drink
a
bottle
of
it
and
maybe
two
if
accompanied
by
food
it
has
a
high
alcohol
content
for
long
drinking
anyway
would
be
an
excellent
replacement
for
a
sweet
wine
but
not
the
thing
you
could
drink
in
a
casual
manner
you
kind
of
have
to
set
aside
your
time
psyche
to
admire
it
d
this
is
a
pretty
sweet
beer
but
still
ok
for
such
a
high
alcohol
content
masked
very
well
there
is
hardly
any
burn
but
the
sweetness
does
become
a
little
annoying
later
down
the
line
pick
this
one
up
to
give
it
a
try
could
be
a
good
gateway
beer
into
belgians
but
i
could
have
used
a
bit
more
balance
drinkability
drinkable
but
due
to
the
sweetness
and
tendency
to
coat
the
mouth
this
beer
may
be
best
when
coupled
with
some
other
dark
ales
like
unibroue
la
terrible
in
a
session
mouthfeel
is
medium
with
a
smooth
amount
of
carbonation
i
can
see
this
going
well
with
a
rich
cheesecake
or
something
equally
bold
and
sweet
and
maybe
it
mellows
over
time
that
said
i
wont
drink
this
again
as
a
standalone
beer
and
dont
think
i
could
get
through
a
750ml
not
bad
but
im
not
likely
to
revisit
this
again
drinkability
not
bad
but
a
little
to
much
alcohol
and
packs
a
bit
of
heavy
punch
for
smooth
easy
drinking
would
have
tough
time
finishing
whole
bottle
but
enjoyable
flavor
overall
not
my
style
of
beer
however
i
enjoyed
the
adventure
this
is
one
of
those
ales
that
inspires
people
to
make
the
claim
that
beer
is
more
sophisticated
than
wine
while
wishing
to
keep
myself
out
of
that
discussion
ill
admit
kasteel
bruin
certainly
helps
out
their
argument
it
really
does
transcend
the
world
of
malted
beverages
any
firstrate
selfrespecting
beer
cellar
will
keep
this
in
stock
im
not
sure
i
can
finish
this
beer
im
afraid
that
it
will
give
me
a
headache
im
not
fond
of
the
sugary
flavor
and
maybe
its
because
i
am
unfamiliar
as
to
what
a
donker
should
taste
like
if
this
indicative
of
the
style
then
ill
steer
clear
im
now
hesitant
to
try
their
tripel
not
best
in
style
but
a
suitable
brew
for
dark
fruit
belgian
lovers
ill
be
going
back
for
more
for
sure
d
for
such
a
strong
beer
you
dont
really
taste
the
alcohol
this
is
very
drinkable
and
i
would
definitely
have
another
d
overall
i
really
enjoyed
this
one
this
is
a
worldclass
beer
without
question
i
think
it
is
a
little
underrated
here
on
ba
definitely
worth
seeking
out
overall
this
is
way
overly
sweet
its
a
bit
of
a
treacly
mess
as
it
warms
and
i
get
accustomed
to
the
sweetness
a
little
nutty
malt
and
banana
come
out
so
theres
some
complexity
but
the
sweetness
overwhelms
everything
and
makes
it
rather
unpleasant
d
quite
drinkable
enjoyable
to
sip
and
let
it
warm
you
drinkability
actually
quite
drinkable
for
its
strength
im
going
to
enjoy
this
glass
a
lot
opinion
overall
this
is
a
pretty
good
beer
i
think
that
it
could
use
a
good
bit
more
carbonation
the
cork
was
only
in
the
bottle
just
over
a
halfinch
so
maybe
a
little
bit
leaked
while
it
was
being
stored
the
cork
has
a
dec2008
stamp
on
it
so
the
beer
really
isnt
that
old
considering
the
abv
oh
well
i
like
the
beer
overall
and
i
wouldnt
mind
trying
it
again
especially
if
it
was
on
tap
when
the
carbonation
was
controlled
the
11
abv
really
fried
me
i
was
a
little
disappointed
in
this
beer
several
of
my
friends
say
this
is
the
best
beer
that
they
have
ever
tasted
but
i
found
it
to
be
extremely
sugary
and
sweet
good
alcohol
content
at
11
and
no
indication
of
the
kick
until
its
on
you
very
expensive
buy
1
bottle
and
try
before
you
spend
the
100
plus
on
a
12
750ml
bottle
case
notes
really
is
like
a
liquid
dessert
lots
of
dark
sweet
fruit
and
sugar
some
may
think
too
much
and
at
timesmoods
i
would
probably
agree
but
i
think
overall
this
is
a
great
beer
with
lots
of
good
flavors
memorable
one
also
definitely
worth
a
try
nothing
wrong
with
the
high
alcohol
content
which
is
masked
by
its
syrupy
character
felt
the
carbonation
was
a
tad
too
low
especially
for
something
this
strong
served
in
a
champagnelike
bottle
sweet
malt
dominates
producing
flavors
of
chocolate
covered
fruit
along
with
fresh
wild
cherries
the
subtle
bitterness
is
juxtaposed
by
big
sweetness
finishes
somewhat
boozy
reminding
me
of
straight
coffee
liquor
pours
a
dark
brown
color
12
inch
head
of
a
pale
tan
color
good
retention
and
decent
lacing
smells
of
sweet
malt
hops
citrus
tart
malt
and
slight
roasted
malt
fits
the
style
of
a
belgian
strong
dark
ale
mouth
feel
is
smooth
and
crisp
with
an
average
carbonation
level
tastes
of
alcohol
sweet
malt
slight
hops
caramel
slight
tart
malt
yeast
and
slight
cherry
overall
good
body
but
noticeably
strong
alcohol
dominates
md
smooth
but
thick
this
beer
does
have
a
good
amount
of
alcohol
warmth
in
the
aftertasteexhale
a
good
one
to
share
this
would
have
been
hard
to
drink
alone
i
think
it
was
a
bit
too
sweet
i
imagine
that
time
would
do
this
one
well
as
it
would
balance
out
somewhat
overall
probably
not
my
first
choice
for
a
belgian
but
i
will
definitely
try
others
great
beer
one
of
my
favorites
when
in
want
something
real
sweet
d
one
of
those
good
belgian
beers
that
gets
stuck
in
the
middle
good
beer
for
sure
but
not
excellent
i
got
this
one
for
free
so
for
me
it
is
a
steal
and
a
good
beer
if
i
paid
over
10
for
it
then
it
would
be
a
bad
beer
horrible
economics
but
facts
you
dont
want
to
drink
much
of
this
but
a
few
sips
on
a
cold
night
and
then
off
to
beddybye
with
sweet
dreams
oh
yes
poured
into
a
chimay
chalice
small
white
head
that
dissipates
quickly
color
is
a
rich
brown
with
a
little
amber
on
the
edges
the
smell
is
candi
sugar
and
ripe
figs
the
taste
is
sugary
sweet
after
it
warms
up
the
taste
isnt
as
potent
the
stickiness
of
the
brew
brings
down
the
motuhfeel
and
drinkability
it
will
warm
you
up
at
the
end
of
the
night
a
definite
sipper
chocolate
aroma
and
taste
of
both
toasted
bread
and
dried
fruit
in
the
mouth
it
is
thick
has
a
taste
of
port
but
more
importantly
it
is
overly
loaded
with
sugar
it
feels
the
sugar
granules
on
the
tongue
the
taste
of
alcohol
is
therefore
fairly
well
hidden
and
is
therefore
withdrawn
unbalanced
and
heavy
its
like
drinking
a
dessert
a
bit
too
sweet
but
very
nice
to
be
sipping
of
i
could
drink
myself
to
death
on
this
beer
a
fine
sipper
and
would
make
an
excellent
dessert
all
on
its
own
the
taste
is
fairly
nice
but
isnt
spectacular
and
the
mediocre
mouth
drags
it
down
a
little
more
there
is
a
nice
variety
of
hints
plums
and
dates
anise
lots
of
candied
sugars
im
sure
it
suffers
from
too
much
sweetness
really
like
they
were
trying
too
hard
to
juice
this
thing
up
and
juiced
up
it
gets
much
too
thick
too
little
carbonation
it
doesnt
get
to
the
point
of
being
difficult
to
drink
but
if
just
a
little
better
i
feel
this
could
have
been
quite
nice
d
because
of
the
high
abv
this
is
an
okay
sipper
i
have
this
750
ml
bottle
to
finish
myself
and
thats
probably
going
to
be
difficult
this
is
good
to
share
with
a
friend
especially
if
that
friend
likes
sweet
boozy
beers
kasteel
donker
which
is
the
exact
same
beer
as
kasteelbier
bruinbrune
is
pretty
good
stuff
that
said
theres
definite
room
for
improvement
belgian
beer
is
like
ice
cream
and
cheesecake
even
the
less
than
spectacular
ones
are
pretty
damn
good
this
is
quite
a
brew
rather
a
bit
syrupy
for
my
taste
but
it
doesnt
necessarily
taste
bad
as
for
the
style
of
a
strong
dark
belgian
ale
i
suppose
but
its
closer
to
cough
syrup
i
did
enjoy
it
overall
though
and
if
you
are
feeling
adventurous
give
it
a
shot
avoid
d
very
good
beer
i
havent
had
a
true
quad
in
a
while
and
this
one
fit
the
bill
great
example
of
the
style
great
beer
but
it
made
me
itch
hmm
thats
never
happened
before
either
way
its
worth
drinking
drink
it
slowly
drink
it
wisely
coz
it
will
kick
you
in
a
place
where
it
hurts
bottom
line
if
youre
expecting
a
rochefort
chimay
blue
or
st
bernardus
youll
be
quite
disappointed
in
contrast
if
you
like
some
of
the
sweeter
belgianstyle
darksdubbels
grimbergen
comes
to
mind
you
may
find
this
enjoyable
if
i
brewed
this
myself
id
lament
the
lack
of
attenuation
chestnutbrown
coloured
creamy
thin

the
boozyness
is
upfront
in
both
the
smell
and
the
taste
but
nevermind
that
its
fruity
and
malty
but
mainly
the
whole
brew
is
too
much
sweetness
from
caramel
and
candy
burnt
sugar
to
me
a
bit
over
the
top
drinkability
is
ok
not
this
beers
strong
suit
as
it
is
so
intense
you
must
sip
slowy
the
kind
of
beer
you
need
to
sip
with
water
an
extreme
quad
and
must
try
for
lovers
of
the
style
a
bit
too
much
for
me
here
though
to

thanks
could
be
a
fan
of
this
brew
cause
its
that
good
i
would
pick
up
a
bottle
of
this
again
in
the
future
a
fun
treat
cheers
poured
from
a
330ml
bottle
has
a
dark
color
like
a
coke
but
with
a
hint
of
read
head
was
a
dark
beige
that
dissipated
into
a
ring
rather
quickly
smelled
of
dark
fruits
tasted
like
a
light
rum
a
mix
of
sugarcane
and
a
little
bit
of
spices
were
there
alcohol
taste
started
to
become
prevalent
after
it
warmed
mouthfeel
was
thick
but
not
too
bubble
overall
pretty
good
i
was
worried
that
it
would
be
too
heavy
for
an
11
but
there
wasnt
a
strong
alcohol
kick
at
all
instead
just
a
subtle
feeling
in
the
aftertaste
md
this
is
more
of
a
treat
beer
though
it
wasnt
too
hard
to
put
down
a
good
10
ounces
of
it
nice
medium
body
overall
an
interesting
and
excellent
beer
tip
the
bottle
says
that
you
have
to
serve
it
at
12c
but
id
drink
it
a
bit
colder
to
mute
the
sweetness
a
bit
overall
a
very
interesting
and
vinous
beer
the
mouth
feel
is
thick
and
coats
the
palate
with
a
sweet
raisin
taste
very
full
flavor
drinkability
like
good
quads
should
id
imagine
this
has
certainly
gotten
better
with
age
along
with
being
much
smoother
now
theres
still
a
big
sweetness
there
and
i
wonder
if
that
would
get
even
less
so
as
it
ages
more
id
imagine
this
could
last
much
longer
in
the
cellar
but
after
4
or
5
years
its
still
going
strong
its
pretty
good
but
you
cant
drink
more
than
one
night

good
enuff
fun
definitly
worth
a
try
like
i
said
this
is
a
very
potent
dark
belgian
ale
that
i
quite
enjoyed
even
if
it
is
ridiculously
sweet
and
the
booze
is
quite
powerful
regardless
the
rumraisin
notes
and
sugarycandy
flavors
pair
nicely
with
the
huge
peppery
alcohol
blast
and
finishes
nicely
with
that
sweet
bready
flavor
on
the
palate
definitely
the
best
strong
dark
ale
ive
tried
up
to
this
point
very
surprised
that
there
are
only
11
reviews
for
this
beer
its
a
definite
must
try
i
think
this
is
an
overall
good
beer
and
probably
shouldve
waited
until
colder
times
to
sample
this
bruin
overall
definitely
a
tasty
treat
its
certainly
aged
well
i
enjoyed
this
one
much
more
than
their
triple
a
solid
drinkable
brew
worth
having
again
rich
mouthfeel
and
pretty
long
lasting
sweet
finish
rich
dark
brown
with
crimson
highlights
and
a
tan
head
this
is
a
pretty
beer
lots
of
lace
densely
bubbled
foam
yeah
looks
good
the
aroma
is
fantastic
as
well
with
ripe
fruit
a
little
roasted
malt
with
lots
of
melanoidins
plenty
of
alcohol
and
a
light
plum
scent
not
as
intense
as
i
expected
the
flavor
though
is
notably
impressive
malty
and
sweet
low
bitterness
and
decent
alcohol
feel
intense
malt
flavor
and
the
plum
qualities
really
come
out
in
the
taste
the
mouthfeel
is
full
and
luxuriously
smooth
the
one
downside
to
the
beer
is
its
sweetness
which
is
not
balanced
at
all
and
can
become
a
bit
cloying
at
times
still
this
is
a
fantastic
brew
notes
bbcsd0902larry
one
thing
of
note
though
i
had
this
brew
before
and
i
remember
a
strong
distinct
sourish
character
in
the
beer
that
i
did
not
find
this
time
around
im
hopping
to
try
this
beer
again
to
see
how
it
holds
up
against
my
two
previous
experiences
feel
and
drinkability
medium
body
with
moderate
delicate
tiny
carbonation
bubbles
nothing
all
that
special
about
it
really
it
does
feel
just
as
it
should
though
i
cant
see
this
one
feeling
any
different
and
having
it
work
as
well
as
what
it
already
is
this
is
an
easy
brew
to
drink
and
its
worth
picking
up
and
trying
i
know
that
ill
be
going
back
to
it
in
the
near
future
its
a
great
beer
that
i
feel
is
overlooked
i
really
wanted
to
like
this
beer
because
i
really
like
the
rouge
from
kasteel
and
at
first
i
thought
i
was
going
to
be
disappointed
if
tasted
cold
this
beer
is
less
than
great
with
both
nose
and
palate
closed
i
would
suggest
serving
this
just
barely
below
room
temp
nc
in
midmarch
the
nose
doesnt
open
much
but
it
tastes
tons
better
notes
i
kept
thinking
of
a
raison
dextra
from
dfh
while
drinking
this
get
it
try
it
love
it
and
leave
it
at
1
a
refreshing
example
of
the
style
a
bit
too
sweet
at
times
but
it
has
enough
depth
to
stand
up
to
other
examples
very
drinkable
beer
is
a
dark
dark
brown
with
little
head
gorgeous
lace
envelops
the
glass
as
you
work
your
way
through
the
beer
smell
is
reminiscent
of
molasses
and
anise
beer
is
very
rich
and
complex
in
flavor
molasses
candied
sugar
chocolate
portlike
alcohol
makes
itself
known
but
is
well
masked
by
the
strong
rich
flavors
chewy
and
sticky
on
the
palate
its
one
of
those
beers
that
you
can
still
taste
for
minutes
after
the
last
sip
and
it
leaves
you
wanting
more
not
for
the
faint
of
heart
with
its
alcohol
level
but
definitely
a
great
sipping
beer
to
be
savored
i
really
liked
this
beer
and
will
seek
it
out
again
holds
its
own
against
some
of
the
best
strong
belgian
darks
out
there
i
likened
it
to
st
bernardus
abt
12
nice
ruby
brown
color
with
an
admirable
sized
head
soft
peppery
aroma
with
a
mild
malt
note
huge
malty
flavor
with
a
moderate
caramel
sweetness
very
slight
hop
bite
mellow
dried
fruit
flavor
lacks
the
yeastysulfury
notes
most
belgians
exhibit
no
trace
of
alcohol
at
11
must
use
quite
the
clean
yeast
to
ferment
great
bodyhas
a
slight
creaminess
to
it
i
find
this
to
be
a
great
beer
rather
sweet
but
i
like
them
like
that
this
would
be
a
great
belgian
to
turn
someone
who
has
never
had
one
on
to
might
not
be
to
style
but
i
really
like
this
one
poured
an
almost
black
body
with
a
constantly
there
onefinger
tan
head
in
a
tulip
glass
a
strong
fruit
smell
like
orange
and
a
little
grape
dark
fruit
and
some
hints
of
sweet
and
bread
malts
a
great
smoothness
is
what
first
struck
me
with
this
beer
as
there
is
a
balance
between
the
malts
some
sweet
and
bread
little
oaky
even
and
darkheavy
fruits
orange
grape
again
a
little
sticky
and
syrupy
like
theres
some
molasses
in
there
but
finishes
clean
with
a
little
bit
of
a
hop
prickle
on
the
tongue
a
solid
beer
to
sip
and
relax
with
as
the
abv
is
wellhidden
the
smell
was
fruity
and
of
brown
sugar
the
fruits
were
definitely
apple
dominated
with
a
tinge
of
sourness
the
taste
was
sweet
then
sour
you
got
a
good
malt
taste
up
front
then
it
was
dominated
by
a
fruity
applenation
the
abv
is
pretty
well
hidden
and
isnt
too
apparent
till
it
hits
the
throat
and
leaves
a
burn
overall
it
is
a
pretty
good
bsda
the
mouthfeel
is
welllaced
with
a
balance
of
hops
fruit
alcohol
and
a
woodinduced
earthiness
the
drinkability
and
finish
are
not
as
wellrounded
as
i
have
come
to
expect
from
most
belgians
but
the
complexity
and
taste
speak
for
themselves
brown
colored
ale
with
a
very
rapidly
fading
head
aroma
is
dark
fuits
taste
is
sugar
caneraisinsplum
fig
and
dark
cherries
alcohol
is
pretty
well
hidden
in
the
taste
but
believe
me
this
is
not
an
ale
you
would
want
to
play
quarters
with
overall
a
solid
ale
that
i
would
recommend
and
purchase
again
smells
of
dark
roasted
malts
and
some
fruit
taste
is
very
sweet
with
dark
fruits
abounding
pretty
big
alcohol
on
the
finish
for
me
really
sweet
sticky
finish
very
creamy
feel
smooth
but
the
alcohol
and
sweetness
is
a
little
too
much
very
interesting
beer
very
different
than
a
lot
of
the
other
quads
not
really
my
favorite
but
fine
nonetheless
d
this
beer
goes
down
pretty
damned
easy
i
kept
catching
myself
taking
bigger
and
bigger
sips
as
i
went
on
i
didnt
want
to
get
trashed
so
i
slowed
myself
about
all
categories
are
solid
or
higher
this
beer
is
damned
good
and
i
have
to
thank
frank
for
telling
me
about
it
the
price
at
just
7
50
further
helps
the
drinkability
because
it
doesnt
break
the
bank
great
beer
d
this
is
a
solid
belgian
beer
thats
well
made
and
goes
down
easy
despite
its
high
abv
pours
a
fourfinger
brown
head
that
fades
slowly
leaving
a
good
lace
mahoganybrown
color
good
carbonation
and
medium
bodied
malty
nose
flavor
is
caramel
dark
fruit
sweet
clean
finish
high
abv
is
hidden
i
need
more
of
these
to
cellar
bottled
jul
2007
4
20
for
a
330ml
bottle
from
a
tullys
beer
wine
wells
me
overall
a
very
good
belgian
style
brew
doesnt
have
the
definitive
butteriness
of
a
quad
but
it
is
close
while
still
showing
some
other
bsda
qualities
this
one
is
sort
of
a
style
melder
but
the
style
that
it
does
fit
perfectly
into
is
the
one
on
the
label
funny
how
that
works
which
is
belgian
brown
ale
a
fantastic
beer
one
i
think
is
a
good
cellar
candidate
for
sure
especially
with
its
mighty
abv
drink
this
one
slowly
and
savor
it
let
it
warm
and
dont
let
the
abv
get
the
best
of
you
and
you
will
be
pleased
one
that
will
satisfy
the
craving
for
the
greatest
of
belgian
style
freaks
a
classic
d
the
high
alcohol
content
can
be
a
bit
overwhelming
after
a
while
and
the
sweet
flavours
started
to
overwhelm
my
palate
as
it
went
down
a
good
beer
but
very
intense
and
best
suited
for
very
slow
consumption
this
was
a
tasty
brew
good
quad
that
i
could
drink
again
if
you
see
one
of
these
in
this
area
thats
not
so
easy
you
should
grab
it
up
put
it
away
and
forget
about
it
when
you
find
it
trust
me
it
will
make
your
day
a
mediumfull
body
light
effervescence
warming
of
the
palate
and
throat
quite
smooth
overall
good
stuff
d
it
was
a
good
quadrupel
with
decent
balance
and
flavor
it
ranks
behind
others
in
its
class
but
it
is
a
good
contender
it
is
a
bit
robust
for
a
session
brew
the
appearance
is
a
really
pretty
dark
brown
that
appears
to
be
a
deep
burgundy
red
when
held
up
to
light
the
head
is
very
thin
almost
nonexistent
smells
good
kind
of
sugary
sweet
with
maybe
hints
of
caramel
and
call
me
crazy
tobacco
the
taste
is
almost
shockingly
sweet
too
much
for
me
you
can
feel
the
alcohol
at
the
end
the
start
is
like
caramel
followed
by
molasses
and
dark
fruits
like
figs
somewhat
syrupy
maybe
feels
very
smooth
like
a
cognac
the
effervescence
is
subtle
overall
decent
drinkability
great
beer
although
i
personally
find
it
to
be
too
sweet
wow
this
is
an
amazingly
tasty
beer
i
love
it
rich
and
complex
tantalizingly
sweet
awesome
i
could
drink
this
damn
near
all
night
or
at
least
until
the
11
knocked
me
out
the
body
is
a
bit
cloying
with
the
sweetness
the
lack
of
carbonation
might
be
effecting
this
overall
this
is
way
too
sweet
for
a
quad
not
even
throwing
a
belgium
quad
into
the
mix
some
off
notes
in
the
nose
and
continue
into
the
taste
maybe
its
some
cup
of
quad
but
there
are
better
us
version
out
there
overall
a
really
tasty
complex
beer
though
it
could
be
too
sweet
for
some
d
very
drinkable
more
so
than
the
alcohol
content
really
allows
especially
if
you
have
to
get
up
in
the
morning
surprisingly
the
sweetness
doesnt
become
cloying
at
all
can
t
taste
the
alcohol
but
you
can
smell
it
and
feel
it
cloyingwith
some
stickyness
yet
smooth
and
suprizing
drinkability
d
a
nice
drink
overall
but
definitely
a
slow
sipper
and
the
bomber
will
take
a
while
to
get
through
the
alcohol
was
noticeable
but
was
halfway
through
the
bottle
before
i
read
the
11
0
abv
which
soon
made
sense
a
good
drink
i
thought
but
more
wine
then
beer
which
sways
me
not
to
try
again
hv
cheers
the
feel
of
the
drink
is
just
about
perfect
the
drink
is
soft
light
and
wellcarbonated
and
is
about
as
quaffable
as
a
big
11
abv
brew
can
be
drinkability
is
good
this
is
a
desert
beer
if
there
ever
was
one
might
be
the
best
example
of
this
style
ive
come
across
pours
a
deep
brown
with
a
good
head
has
wonderful
raisin
and
plum
notes
very
boozy
tasting
in
a
good
way
the
mouthfeel
is
rich
and
thick
without
ever
being
sticky
some
winelike
flavors
come
through
late
highly
recommended
this
is
an
easy
beer
with
which
to
get
snookered
its
subtle
and
powerful
it
isnt
a
beer
with
complexity
d
for
a
quadrupel
this
is
pretty
drinkable
that
said
i
dont
know
if
i
could
handle
more
than
one
in
a
go
but
im
definitely
looking
forward
to
the
rest
of
this
one
not
a
ton
of
carbonation
surprising
brings
forth
a
very
dark
cloudy
amber
colored
beer
with
just
a
half
inch
of
offwhite
head
that
soon
falls
to
a
trace
aromas
are
a
mix
of
spicy
phenolics
dark
fruits
bright
alcohol
and
a
touch
of
toasty
malt
notes
on
the
palate
it
is
a
very
rich
thick
belgian
with
tons
of
malty
flavors
minimal
carbonation
and
a
pretty
sweet
finish
overall
its
a
bit
different
than
most
bsda
but
i
like
how
they
presented
it
alcohol
content
is
not
obvious
in
the
tasting
but
as
i
drink
this
i
begin
to
feel
it
couldnt
see
having
more
than
one
of
these
this
would
make
a
marvelous
dessert
beer
something
to
be
sipped
and
savored
slowly
overall
a
different
quadrupel
than
the
ones
im
used
to
and
that
i
enjoy
more
this
was
still
interesting
but
i
dont
think
i
would
go
for
it
again
way
too
drinkable
overall
this
is
a
very
good
beer
and
incredibly
smooth
for
the
strength
but
it
doesnt
quite
have
the
aweinspiring
complexity
of
the
great
quads
still
very
much
worth
trying
sip
this
one
serving
per
sitting
but
what
a
sitting
on
tap
at
pitchers
pub
in
cumberland
ri
pours
dark
brown
nice
aroma
of
dark
fruits
brown
sugar
and
a
hint
of
alcohol
flavor
of
dark
fruits
and
brown
suagr
with
a
warming
alcohol
finish
has
a
very
vneous
quality
quite
tasty
but
very
sweet
which
is
a
little
distracting
underneath
the
sweetness
is
a
beer
with
a
loy
of
complexity
i
enjoyed
the
beer
but
its
defintely
not
an
everyday
beer
this
thing
is
just
too
sweet
without
enough
other
complexities
that
stand
out
or
even
hold
their
own
maybe
passable
as
a
dessert
but
even
then
the
medicinal
notes
might
detract
from
that
as
well
d
it
is
very
sweet
and
not
tart
enough
to
balance
all
of
the
flavors
to
drink
an
entire
glass
d
this
would
be
a
very
tasty
brew
if
it
werent
for
that
little
bit
of
sour
fruit
in
the
back
still
not
terrible
and
seems
reasonably
drinkable
for
a
quad
poured
from
a
750
ml
bottle
into
two
pint
glasses
very
mixed
feelings
about
this
beer
pours
an
opaque
dark
brown
color
that
looks
like
murky
pond
water
nose
is
sugar
candy
dried
fruit
taste
is
very
sweet
unfortunately
i
could
only
handle
a
few
sips
of
this
beer
this
beer
is
so
sweet
its
nearly
undrinkable
ive
tried
giving
this
beer
a
chance
two
times
now
and
both
times
its
just
too
alcoholic
and
too
sweet
to
finish
not
my
favorite
quad
too
sweet
to
be
truly
enjoyable
drinkability
this
is
simultaneously
full
flavored
and
refreshing
i
quickly
finished
the
1
pt
9
4oz
bottle
and
wished
for
a
case
of
the
stuff
its
very
drinkable
d
a
little
tasty
goes
down
ok
not
too
filling
strong
kick
decent
representation
of
style
this
one
really
didnt
appeal
to
me
all
that
well
ive
certainly
had
other
strong
belgians
that
i
like
better
i
was
expecting
to
enjoy
it
more
as
the
11
abv
kicked
in
like
the
120
minute
ipa
which
went
from
cough
syrup
to
amazing
but
nothing
doing
to
be
honest
i
couldnt
even
finish
it
the
nose
is
sweet
caramel
apricot
or
figs
or
prune
the
taste
followed
this
nose
this
beer
is
made
with
high
standards
but
is
too
sweet
for
my
tastes
caramel
and
dark
fruits
prevail
not
a
hop
profile
to
speak
of
overall
a
good
beer
but
as
as
i
said
a
tad
sweet
750
ml
green
belgian
bottle
copped
caged
and
corked
from
total
wine
and
more
in
west
orange
kasteel
donker
on
the
logo
sticker
this
beer
packs
a
punch
at
a
whopping
11
abv
pours
a
grapecolored
hue
with
minimal
frothy
head
that
left
apparent
lacing
around
the
top
of
my
mug
strong
alcoholic
and
prune
aroma
leads
to
a
taste
complete
with
dark
dehyrdated
fruits
raisins
currants
figs
caramel
and
cinnamon
the
strong
alcohol
content
is
certainly
noticeable
in
both
the
flavor
and
aroma
and
makes
itself
known
after
a
few
sips
with
a
warm
inviting
glow
definitely
a
beer
for
colderweather
days
although
labeled
as
a
quadrupel
this
brew
could
easily
pass
as
a
belgian
strong
dark
ale
with
its
syrup
and
molasses
quality
not
my
favoritetasting
sample
but
a
quality
brew
nontheless
strong
rich
and
dark
flavor
is
really
highlighted
worth
a
try
not
my
favorite
quadrupel
but
a
very
good
one
thick
and
silky
with
ample
carbonation
a
very
complex
dark
belgian
brew
has
a
long
shelf
life
but
i
think
it
is
best
a
around
1
year
i
have
aged
a
few
for
longer
but
the
sweetness
gets
out
of
balance
this
baby
would
certainly
make
an
excellent
dessert
after
a
hearty
dinner
out
of
a
750ml
corked
caged
and
foiled
bottle
the
cork
indicates
that
it
was
born
in
november
of
2003
the
label
states
to
drink
by
november
of
2008
pours
a
murky
brown
color
with
a
nice
offwhite
head
that
left
a
nice
ring
around
the
glass
with
some
nice
lacing
the
smell
is
of
mellow
roasted
malt
mellow
dark
fruit
and
some
port
wine
characteristics
a
lighly
roasted
malt
flavor
sweet
with
a
nice
mellow
wine
grape
flavor
quite
olde
ale
like
definitely
port
wine
like
nice
and
mellow
nothing
sharp
here
a
belgian
olde
ale
perhaps
the
feel
is
moderate
with
soft
carbonation
finishes
sweet
slick
and
sticky
definitely
an
aged
sample
here
and
aged
well
the
mellow
flavor
is
quite
good
it
is
very
sweet
but
is
quite
drinkable
some
nice
fruity
flavors
rich
and
smooth
feel
to
it
very
drinkable
even
at
11
we
polished
off
4
small
bottles
on
the
night
served
in
my
sam
adams
sensory
glass
poured
the
color
of
cola
two
inch
thick
fluffy
white
head
settled
into
a
thin
layer
of
foam
a
sheet
of
belgian
lacing
blanketed
the
sides
of
the
glass
during
the
tasting
strong
scent
of
dark
fruit
immediately
hits
the
nose
raisins
prunes
plums
followed
by
a
sweet
sugary
smell
and
a
faint
aroma
of
yeast
taste
similar
to
nose
with
a
bit
of
alcohol
astringency
at
the
finish
which
is
pleasantly
masked
by
the
sweetness
of
the
brew
warm
full
mouthfeel
with
a
little
liveliness
on
the
tongue
this
is
a
truly
greaat
quadrupel
but
definitely
meant
for
savoring
slowly
d
an
interesting
beer
ive
heard
this
described
as
a
belgian
barleywine
and
i
can
understand
why
though
quadrupel
seems
to
fit
it
well
as
a
style
on
this
site
a
very
good
beer
sweet
and
warming
the
smell
and
taste
could
use
a
bit
more
oomph
but

well
made
belgian
brew
but
overall
an
enjoyable
warming
beer
or
nightcap
this
reminds
me
of
one
of
my
alltime
favorites
gouden
carolus
noel
christmas
ill
take
that
over
this
but
ill
recommend
both
for
the
high
abv
category
but
of
the
quads
ive
had
this
is
one
of
my
least
favorite
if
you
have
the
means
get
your
hands
on
this
beer
i
would
have
ordered
another
if
i
didnt
have
to
drive
home
drinkability
very
powerful
brew
but
quite
enjoyable
best
suited
to
having
a
single
drink
with
some
good
cheese
or
as
an
accompaniment
to
a
rich
dessert
or
maybe
just
have
it
as
the
dessert
can
stand
alone
and
is
a
wonderful
brew
to
have
with
a
good
book
or
good
friends
after
dinner
dworth
a
try
i
suppose
too
sweet
for
me
personally
packs
a
wallop
pours
a
lovely
chocolate
brown
with
ruby
tinges
and
little
head
the
nose
is
straightforward
quad
with
sugary
smells
some
raw
alcohol
and
lots
of
chocolate
and
some
sweet
raisiny
fruit
notes
on
the
palate
overly
sweet
first
off
with
some
definite
cloying
going
on
before
a
dusty
slightly
rough
date
element
comes
out
some
creamedandsugared
coffee
toward
the
end
the
finish
is
long
and
active
but
way
too
sweet
with
no
balancing
hop
influence
to
speak
of
mouthfeel
is
hot
with
alcohol
and
heavy
on
malts
with
little
lightness
on
display
not
that
i
want
my
quads
to
be
light
but
you
gotta
have
balance
somewhere
overall
this
is
not
a
good
quad
too
sweet
no
balance
and
not
nearly
enough
complexity
to
save
things
in
any
way
pass
pours
a
clear
mohogany
color
with
some
tan
head
and
plenty
of
lacing
smells
of
dried
and
candied
dark
fruit
fig
rasins
and
very
earthy
taste
is
very
complex
the
earthy
notes
are
the
backbone
to
a
nice
and
sweet
fig
dried
fruit
and
almost
some
cherry
gets
a
little
medicinal
taste
in
the
finish
as
it
warms
up
full
in
the
mouth
but
ever
so
smoooth
very
drinkable
for
such
a
high
abv
brew
a
delish
experience
indeed
that
must
be
tried
tough
to
rate
as
this
is
the
first
barleywine
that
ive
ever
had
i
dont
know
if
it
was
the
style
or
just
the
alcohol
in
this
beer
but
it
was
really
tough
to
swallow
at
times
i
enjoyed
everything
about
this
except
for
the
acidic
bitter
surge
that
came
to
me
when
i
swallowed
other
than
that
this
is
a
great
sit
down
and
watch
a
movie
beer
one
of
the
best
quads
that
i
have
had
the
pleasure
to
enjoy
this
one
really
hides
the
11
extremely
well
drinkability
really
a
bit
too
cloying
for
my
taste
compared
to
the
top
quads
this
lacks
the
complexity
that
the
great
ones
have
ruddy
brown
with
a
small
white
head
fairly
powerful
nose
hints
of
brown
sugar
plums
dates
red
apple
golden
apple
caramel
toffee
and
a
bit
of
barnyard
flavor
is
extremely
sweet
and
very
fruity
honestly
i
think
its
a
pretty
tasty
beer
well
hidden
alcohol
with
a
balanced
flavor
this
is
a
fairly
tasty
enjoyable
belgian
the
sweetness
and
abv
slow
this
one
down
but
it
is
a
nice
complex
dark
belgian
brew
that
is
very
nice
to
sip
on
pours
a
dark
brown
with
a
tan
head
that
disapates
quickly
in
the
aroma
it
is
a
sweet
caramel
and
alcohol
smell
in
the
taste
the
carmel
is
there
and
hints
of
bitter
sweet
chocolate
it
has
a
small
alcohol
presence
but
it
is
so
smooth
and
rich
the
alcohol
mixes
well
with
the
other
flavors
and
i
was
already
slightly
intoxicated
a
pretty
good
but
still
a
few
steps
to
being
a
great
beer
poured
from
a
33cl
bottle
it
looks
ruby
red
black
in
the
glass
is
that
possible
the
head
is
minimal
tan
and
a
touch
sticky
the
smell
is
astringent
dusky
malt
and
sour
cherries
the
taste
has
a
surprising
sugar
dominance
over
a
cherry
background
the
finish
shows
the
hops
subtle
but
adding
a
great
balance
in
the
immortal
words
of
homer
simmpson
swet
jeebus
this
stuff
is
begging
to
be
aged
and
that
just
became
my
plan
for
the
2nd
bottle
i
have
the
mouthfeel
is
syrupy
but
nicely
carbonated
it
has
enough
bubbles
to
keep
it
from
falling
into
the
trap
that
barley
wines
do
for
me
they
become
cloyingly
sweet
my
apologies
to
the
fans
of
35
year
old
thomas
hardy
ale
but
its
not
for
me
and
this
really
is
the
drinkability
is
excellent
even
though
it
clocks
in
at
11
percent
the
alcohol
really
only
manifests
itself
as
a
warmth
down
the
throat
and
chest
nice
nice
nice
if
you
can
find
this
stuff
buy
it
period
from
a
growler
purchased
at
half
time
pours
dark
mahogony
seems
to
be
pretty
low
in
carbonation
mellow
head
with
just
minor
lacing
observed
nose
is
nicely
glowing
with
cola
vanilla
bourbon
and
spice
strong
late
night
sipper
kind
of
brew
plenty
of
dark
candi
sugars
cola
alcohol
complexity
etc
to
please
all
the
strong
beerquad
lovers
out
there
character
boldness
obviously
evident
well
worth
a
try
if
you
like
the
style
not
for
everybody
but
certaintly
for
me
a
treat
and
in
nice
shape
on
tapgrowler
4s
straight
across
this
is
less
expensive
than
some
of
the
top
rated
quads
and
i
think
it
is
worth
the
price
very
pleasant
and
drinkable
do
not
chug
at
11
abv
as
to
the
mouthfeel
i
experienced
a
biscuity
and
chewy
viscous
treat
just
perfect
or
as
close
as
you
can
get
to
it
this
was
a
pleasure
to
enjoy
and
to
think
it
was
available
on
tap
i
only
wish
the
pubs
in
my
area
would
pursue
such
a
treasure
as
this
thank
you
once
again
brick
store
i
am
very
impressed
with
how
good
this
beer
is
in
a
nutshell
its
cottoncandy
sweet
fruity
tart
spicy
warm
and
marshmellow
textured
its
wonderful
from
sip
to
finish
a
hearty
malt
candy
sweetness
blends
with
nuts
figs
dates
and
a
hint
of
chocolate
balanced
with
aged
hops
and
yeasty
esters
bring
out
clove
and
pepperyness
full
and
richly
textured
without
a
hint
of
astringency
or
heat
finishes
very
clean
despite
so
many
complex
flavors
and
a
bit
dry
this
beer
ranks
up
there
with
the
rocheforts
and
abt
12s
of
the
world
an
odd
brew
but
a
great
one
its
great
when
fresh
and
better
when
its
3
years
old
like
this
bottle
is
i
really
think
this
needs
another
5
to
10
years
to
really
shine
ill
hold
on
to
another
few
bottles
for
a
decade
or
so
to
see
how
they
turn
out
right
now
it
is
good
but
its
just
a
little
too
cola
like
it
really
almost
tastes
like
a
thicker
version
of
pepsi
its
not
too
sweet
but
i
consider
it
a
dessert
beer
its
full
bodied
but
not
thick
its
drinkable
if
you
like
big
sweet
beer
moving
from
a
dubbel
sensibility
into
a
big
beer
unique
unto
itself
it
remains
unique
not
amazing
but
very
solid
and
something
ill
buy
again
only
had
a
lil
33cl
stubby
bottle
could
have
drank
a
bigger
jobber
this
is
a
fine
example
of
a
quad
the
2004
bottle
really
held
up
well
in
comparison
to
the
2000
aged
a
few
more
years
the
alcohol
subsides
into
some
awesome
flavors
ill
definitely
be
throwing
more
bottles
in
my
cellar
for
a
few
years
not
much
carbonation
and
it
poured
a
dark
brown
wred
rubylike
color
the
alcohol
hits
you
right
away
but
it
has
a
fantastic
burnt
caramel
taste
i
find
it
to
be
very
heavy
and
filling
for
me
its
powerful
stuff
and
not
to
be
taken
lightly
ive
had
several
bottles
and
some
are
better
than
others
but
most
are
very
very
good
this
was
a
gorgeous
beer
id
love
to
get
another
shot
at
reviewing
it
highly
recommended
this
is
a
wonderful
quad
and
great
on
tap
i
havent
tried
a
bottle
yet
but
will
look
forward
to
go
and
drink
some
of
this
nectar
4
year
old
750ml
bottle
poured
dirty
looking
like
rust
and
stagnant
creek
water
aroma
of
dusty
attic
and
dry
earth
flavor
was
sweet
stewed
dark
fruit
with
port
and
sherry
notes
i
keep
my
cellar
bottles
well
and
they
do
not
get
light
heat
or
physical
disturbance
but
this
one
must
have
had
all
the
yeast
completely
in
solution
because
it
was
so
cloudy
but
without
any
floaty
chunks
etc
i
have
had
my
fare
share
of
five
and
six
year
old
belgian
ales
but
this
one
was
weird
it
just
came
out
all
weird
looking
but
still
tasted
fine
d
i
rate
this
one
just
above
average
the
large
11
abv
alcohol
content
is
very
well
hidden
but
the
overly
sweet
flavors
make
a
dent
in
the
drinkability
factor
for
me
with
more
balance
this
beer
could
be
quite
good
wonderful
smell
delicious
taste
and
a
solid
fantastic
representation
of
the
style
smashing
drinkability
a
little
sweet
but
otherwise
drinkable
overall
this
is
a
very
good
quad
but
a
bit
overly
sweet
the
11
is
a
little
more
evident
but
complexity
makes
it
more
drinkable
talk
about
your
winter
warmers
looking
back
at
my
review
my
instincts
were
right
this
better
than
the
stuff
supposedly
in
its
prime
11
2
oz
belgian
stubby
with
a
freshness
date
of
july
2010
served
a
bit
too
cold
at
michaels
bistro
and
taphouse
in
a
small
snifter
it
pours
a
clouded
brownishred
that
is
ruby
in
the
light
and
is
topped
with
a
small
light
brown
head
that
retains
a
thin
collar
the
aroma
is
quite
vinous
sugary
sweet
with
a
blackberry
kick
think
chambord
it
is
hugely
sweet
on
the
palate
very
portlike
with
pepper
berries
and
maybe
some
hops
near
the
end
the
body
is
medium
yet
syrupy
thick
with
light
carbonation
and
a
medium
finish
on
the
plus
side
the
alcohol
is
undetectable
but
on
the
negative
side
it
is
way
too
sweet
and
a
bit
difficult
to
drink
making
me
wonder
as
to
why
it
is
rated
so
highly
33cl
bottle
this
one
pours
a
slightly
hazy
caramel
brown
there
was
a
very
small
head
on
mine
the
aroma
is
quite
nice
caramel
malt
comes
through
with
some
breadiness
some
fruits
in
there
also
possibly
raisins
and
plums
very
full
rich
taste
some
candi
sugar
plums
breadiness
many
others
an
exceptional
brew
taste
was
sweet
my
teeth
almost
fell
out
of
my
mouth
unbelievable
the
alcohol
is
also
very
apparent
and
off
course
the
beer
is
sticky
i
could
barely
get
my
lipps
off
each
other
every
other
taste
that
is
possibly
in
there
is
masked
by
the
sweetness
of
the
beer
i
would
not
advise
this
to
anyone
who
is
a
serious
beeradvocate
opened
this
with
a
friend
to
celebrate
the
births
of
my
new
daughter
and
his
new
son
he
stays
away
from
dark
beer
but
this
one
certainly
won
him
over
brown
head
with
few
bubbles
it
doesnt
last
much
and
leaves
almost
no
lace
brown
reddish
very
nice

apricots
and
plums
a
hint
of

cane
alcohol
sherry
aged
wine
heavy
sweet
flavor
i
think
that
i
notice
it
more
in
the
75
cl
bottle
than
in
the
33
cl
one
dont
know
why
lately
i
find
the
sweetness
a
bit
artificial
mouth
of
chocolate
brandy
cherries
plums
apricots
sherry
aged
wine
again
sugar
cane
aniseed
a
beer
of
the
gods
one
of
them
too
complex
to
find
all
the
characters
in
one
taste
d
wasnt
particularly
easy
to
drink
if
you
like
sweet
beer
then
give
it
a
go
but
its
not
something
ill
be
trying
again
soon
as
i
found
the
sweetness
overpowering
rich
and
fruity
flavor
alcohol
still
present
in
this
nearly
three
year
old
sample
sweetish
and
candy
sugar
flavore
hints
of

and
notes
of

big
beer
thick
and
sticky
mouth
although
the
low
level
of
alcohol
taste
dries
it
out
keeps
the
sweetness
in
check
this
is
some
nice
brew
some
more
for
the
cellar
is
in
order

clouded
opaque
dark

rapidly

of
dark

medicinal
alcohol
flavor
begins
with
sweet
sour
medicinal
alcohol
sting
becomes
round
and
malty
sweet
in
the
middle
and
finishes
the
same
way
heavy
syrupy
body
with
minimal
carbonation
not
a
great
quad
kind
of
heavy
on
the
alcohol
tones
for
my
taste
side
note
i
found
near
the
end
if
you
drink
it
slower
than
i
would
the
adding
up
of
the
candy
sweet
taste
does
not
really
happen
so
i
would
recomend
to
drink
this
beer
at
a
slower
pace
than
me
to
enjoy
it
the
most
the
problem
is
it
will
let
you
drink
it
fast
cause
its
good
this
is
a
pretty
drinkable
beer
but
is
11abv
so
be
carefull
and
dont
hurt
yourself

coating
slides
all
over
your
tongue
with
hints
of
cherries
and
caramel
in
the
background
all
followed
by
a
nice
warm
alcohol
note
overall
a
very
nice
quad
nice
sipping
beer
for
a
relaxing
evening
of
course
cant
drink
too
many
of
these
my
limit
is
one
drinkability
the
sweetness
is
more
subdued
than
on
tap
if
my
memory
serves
making
this
a
more
balanced
and
mellowed
beer
a
great
dessert
beer
above
average
vs
the
style
full
body
with
a
velvety
smoooth
mouthfeel
and
i
do
mean
smoooth
too
easy
to
drink
tastes
like
candy
cheers
i
would
love
to
drink
more
of
this
beer
if
it
was
in
my
area
i
would
go
looking
for
it
damn
who
dumped
the
sugar
bowl
in
my
beer
pours
out
to
a
cloudy
and
hazy
brown
appearance
with
a
big
light
tan
foamy
head
unorganized
lace
inside
the
glass
aromas
of
sugary
yeast
and
malt
with
a
candied
toffee
element
taste
is
medium
bodied
decent
complexity
but
way
sweet
candied
sugar
mild
sweet
malt
and
grain
some
bread
yeast
a
touch
of
clove
and
spices
not
bad
but
way
too
sugary
for
me
mouthfeel
was
sticky
sweet
almost
like
a
lollipop
drinkability
would
be
better
if
again
it
wasnt
so
sweet
take
away
some
of
the
sugaryness
and
this
is
a
far
improved
beer
worth
a
try
drinkable
in
terms
a
sipping
ale
wouldnt
want
to
down
a
few
but
really
nice
to
split
a
750
with
someone
750
ml
bottle
served
at
room
temperature
it
pours
a
deep
amber
to
ambered
brown
color
with
a
finger
of
off
white
head
that
falls
to
a
solid
coat
over
top
solid
lacing
remains
as
things
recede
nose
is
full
of
big
dark
fruit
fig
soaked
it
rum
light
puffs
of
alcohol
there
is
also
a
healthy
dose
of
bready
and
spicey
notes
as
well
flavor
is
very
mellow
good
sweet
fruity
fig
with
a
healthy
but
not
offensive
alcohol
in
the
background
with
light
doughy
breadyness
and
a
healthy
spicey
yeast
character
in
there
as
well
i
like
it
feel
is
big
and
thick
almost
chewy
with
a
light
carbonation
i
enjoy
this
beer
even
with
the
alcohol
presence
it
is
pretty
drinkable
i
can
feel
it
going
to
my
head
a
bit
as
i
drink
it
more
so
i
know
one
of
these
a
night
would
do
me
just
fine
a
sweet
sweet
treat
very
sensitive
and
smooth
a
carefully
crafted
sipper
thatll
keep
you
planted
in
one
place
for
a
while
as
it
takes
hold
of
your
senses
a
very
nice
brew
and
highly
recommended
this
is
my
second
review
take
it
easy
on
me
what
is
that
flavor
this
brew
was
shared
by
a
fellow
homebrewer
pours
a
redbrown
color
with
a
large
head
that
has
ok
retention
and
leaves
plenty
of
lacing
on
the
glass
the
aroma
is
excellent
filled
with
all
the
goodies
dark
fruits
raisins
alcohol
toasty
spice
sweetness
yeasty
malty
all
just
jumping
out
the
flavor
is
equally
complex
and
great
as
it
warms
tons
of
dark
fruits
and
raisins
come
across
with
some
spices
citrus
alcohol
and
plenty
of
caramel
malt
the
mouthfeel
is
on
the
high
end
of
moderate
and
the
drinkability
is
great
this
is
one
of
the
better
belgian
beers
ive
had
except
westy
and
rochefort
and
probably
the
best
brew
ive
had
in
a
long
while
the
mouth
is
full
no
chewiness
or
over
the
top
carbonation
despite
the
loud
pop
when
disgorged
at
the
same
time
it
doesnt
lean
towards
flat
given
its
winey
nature
normally
i
take
a
point
or
so
away
from
a
beer
that
has
such
a
high
abv
as
drinking
a
lot
can
lead
to
a
short
but
messy
night
for
this
beer
im
willing
to
slow
down
and
enjoy
as
much
as
i
can
absolutely
worth
7
99
a
bottle
the
high
abv
at
11
is
not
really
a
factor
in
the
taste
d
this
is
a
good
complex
malty
beer
that
has
great
complexity
i
happen
to
meet
the
brewer
after
i
wrote
my
review
and
he
said
the
kegs
are
all
pasteurized
but
the
bottles
are
still
alive
and
kicking
so
i
will
have
to
try
those
next
dark
brown
in
colour
complex
caramel
malt
aromas
along
with
notes
of
raisin
vanilla
and
other
dried
fruits
its
fairly
thick
bodied
and
has
some
interesting
flavors
going
on
such
as
malt
prunes
brown
sugar
more
vanilla
and
a
mild
chocolate
note
i
actually
drank
this
stuff
at
the
proper
temperature
this
time
complex
and
strong
stuff
honey
colored
cloudy
brown
with
ruby
tones
in
the
light
no
head
to
speak
of
smells
wonderful
and
full
wow
of
roasty
pruny
flavors
raisins
port
wine
honey
sweetness
mouthfeel
is
slick
and
slightly
syrupy
asks
to
be
drunk
a
little
slower
than
you
wanted
to
drink
it
similar
prunes
and
raisins
and
port
wine
sweetness
in
my
mouth
wow
this
is
a
wonderful
beer
the
sweetness
is
best
appreciated
as
or
with
dessert
also
paired
beautifully
with
a
dutch
goudalike
cheese
with
caraway
seeds
in
it
the
slight
spice
in
the
cheese
with
the
sweetness
of
the
beer
was
great
smooth
very
nice
feel
in
the
mouth
definite
warmth
in
the
finish
but
drinkable
this
would
be
a
good
desert
beer
either
by
itself
or
accompanying
a
dark
fruity
torte
great
beer
perfect
for
a
nightcap
taste
was
aroma
like
hits
with
grape
and
fruit
with
hints
of
brown
sugar
and
chocolate
sweet
but
not
overly
sweet
its
full
bodied
and
packs
a
punch
its
smooth
sticky
and
the
alcohol
makes
its
presence
known
as
it
warms
the
body
mind
and
soul
only
beer
ive
had
that
got
progressively
worse
and
undrinkable
as
time
went
on
pours
a
dark
mahogany
brown
lots
of
off
white
head
and
lacing
smells
is
sweet
malt
alcohol
and
dark
fruits
taste
is
horribly
sweet
dark
cherries
and
overpowering
alcohol
the
mouthfeel
was
the
only
pleasant
thing
about
this
beer
the
carbonation
was
good
this
beer
is
only
good
for
cooking
it
tasted
like
brown
sugar
mixed
with
rubbing
alcohol
and
this
was
a
bottle
that
had
been
aged
for
7
months
at
my
house
insanely
one
dimensional
it
burns
from
the
alcohol
not
recommended
at
all
horrible
it
took
all
my
willpower
to
force
it
down
and
not
throw
this
out
great
stuff
pours
a
confident
dense
brown
with
a
thin
coating
of
bubbles
on
top
lacing
is
pronounced
and
slides
down
the
side
of
the
glass
like
a
slug
smells
very
buttery
yeast
toffee
and
malt
notes
fruity
with
a
definite
trappist
edge
in
the
nose
wow
explodes
with
banana
and
berry
flavors
taste
is
a
sweet
kick
with
smoothness
going
down
alcohol
is
evident
but
muted
by
the
intense
flavor
experience
here
leaps
and
bounds
above
the
lighter
kasteel
this
is
a
nice
affordable
halfway
point
between
rocs
grand
cru
and
a
trappist
quad

dubbel

clear

very
dark

like

under

fades
to

almost
immediately
but
then
leaves
some
pretty
impressive
lace
strings
along
the
side
sweet
caramel
malt
nose
like
candy
mildly
carbonated
and
pretty
sticky
basically
the
consistency
of
a
semiflat
coke
but
in
a
good
way
the
opening
taste
is
way
too
sweet
what
no
sugar
in
here
ha
almost
like
maple
syrup
some
hops
try
to
fight
their
way
through
the
sweetness
and
manage
to
get
noticed
before
falling
back
into
the
sugary
swamp
the
overall
impression
is
way
too
sweet
for
me
i
cant
recommend
it
poured
dark

gorgeous

aroma
of

extremely
sweet
dark

ripe

extremely
complex

smooth
full
bodied
it
was
just
a
bit
too
sweet
for
my
tastes
made
it
hard
to
finish
its
definitely
a
sipper
this
appears
to
be
an

an
opaque
dark
chocolate
brown
color
with
a
sustaining
tan
head
that
laces
nicely
a
lot
of
vinous
yeasty
notes
with
a
ridiculous
amount
of
dark
roasted
candi
sugar
and
malts
some
earthy
undertones
as
well
upon
first
sip
i
think
to
myself
how
a
couple
of
years
ago
this
was
like
mothers
milk
to
me
and
i
reflect
upon
the
fact
that
palates
and
peoples
taste
preferences
change
over
time
and
how
much
this
beer
could
rot
your
teeth
if
you
pass
out
before
brushing
them
holy
shit
is
it
sweet
with
just
enough
vinous
fruitiness
and
moderate
hoppiness
to
cut
it
before
it
becomes
too
cloying
i
still
love
this
beer
though
im
just
a
bit
more
critical
about
beers
than
a
couple
of
years
ago
im
just
trying
to
reminisce
why
i
loved
this
beer
so
much
a
couple
years
ago
i
think
its
the
creamy
mouthfeel
paired
with
a
deep
malty
alcoholic
punch
that
is
very
clean
finishing
yet
coating
the
mouth
with
stickiness
dangerously
drinkable
especially
for
its
lofty
11
abv
but
overall
a
little
too
sweet
to
give
it
a
4
in
the
drinkability
rating
i
enjoyed
this
beauty
from
my
cellar
with
a
hunk
of
callebaut
65
dark
chocolate
and
i
could
not
wish
for
a
better
pairing
instead
of
an
overload
of
sweetness
the
two
brought
out
earthy
and
savory
flavors
left
and
right
of

the
belgians
just
might
know
what
they
are
doing
maybe
possibly

330
ml
short
brown
bottle
with
best
before
date
stamped
on
the
rear
label
poured
a
clear
brown
color
ale
with
a
below
average
head
that
had
some
pretty
good
retention
aroma
is
exclusively
comprised
of
roasted
malt
with
some
faint
alcohol
in
the
back
taste
is
quite
simple
which
was
a
bit
surprising
for
this
type
of
beer
and
consisted
of
mildly
roasted
malt
with
some
warm
alcohol
at
the
end
overall
this
is
not
a
bad
beer
but
it
is
lacking
complexity
sampled
a
750ml
bottle
with
a
gebotteld
date
of
112003
poured
a
beautiful
dark
copper
color
into
my
goblet
left
a
medium
head
that
quickly
dissipated
into
a
heavy
lacing
smelt
of
caramel
chocolate
and
fruits
these
aromas
became
more
pronounced
as
the
beer
warmed
a
pronounced
yet
balanced
sweetness
that
was
consistent
to
the
last
milliliter
had
an
exquisite
creaminess
which
is
surprising
when
one
considers
the
11
abv
most
certainly
drinkable
but
probably
better
enjoyed
in
sips
versus
quaffs
im
pacing
myself
so
my
six
bottles
will
last
until
my
trip
to
mardi
gras
next
month
when
i
pick
up
at
least
another
six
bottles
dont
pass
this
beer
by
if
given
an
opportunity
to
sample
it
now
if
they
can
only
find
a
texas
distributor
nicely
complex
an
enjoyable
beer
best
suited
for
sitting
back
in
the
comfy
chair
when
youve
got
no
plans
to
be
going
anywhere
this
was
from
a
750ml
bottle
dated
092003
appears
a
slightly
translucent
brown
with
reddish
highlights
and
a
slight
tan
head
that
bubbles
down
fairly
quickly
some
lace
it
left
around
the
glass
as
it
was
consumed
aroma
was
fruity
sweet
with
dark
ripe
fruits
and
a
light
sugary
caramel
there
was
a
bit
of
spice
to
it
as
well
as
notes
of
yeast
and
alcohol
fruity
sweetness
starts
of
the
flavor
before
giving
way
to
doughy
malt
with
spice
that
keeps
the
sweetness
in
check
alcohol
was
barely
noticeable
and
the
after
taste
left
a
sweet
spiciness
on
your
tongue
mouthfeel
was
medium
to
full
with
a
nice
creaminess
and
it
was
a
bit
warming
as
well
drinkability
is
great
you
just
have
to
slow
down
a
bit
to
enjoy
all
the
complexities
of
this
fine
beer
great
all
around
beer
that
i
will
definitely
pick
up
again
kasteel

a
murky
brown
color

practically
no
head
but
there
was
a
good
amount
of

smell
is
really
sweet
and
vinous
taste
is
the
same
way
lots
of
dark
vinous
fruits
in
a
variety
of
flavors
burst
out
from
the
start
really
sweet
but
there
wasnt
much
of
a
malty
sweetness
alcohol
comes
in
and
has
quite
a
kick
with
lots
of
flavor
theres
a
strong
belgian
yeast
element
in
here
that
melds
well
with
the
alcohol
finish
is
dry
and
a
bit
weak
for
my
liking
becomes
too
syruppy
sweet
after
a
while
needs
more
effervescence
to
offset
the
fruits
decent
but
not
the
greatest
belgian
i
have
had
bottled
typical
belgian
stubbie

a
flat

some
malt
body
and
the
ever
pervasive
alcohol
very
much
like
a
carib
sweet
stout
bad
job
of
hiding
it
and
too
sweet
with
adjuncts
to
be
considered
a
serious
for
a
european
ale
these
belgium
mutants
should
have
their
own
category

the

is
zesty
and
very
warming
though
its
in
check
considering
the
high

in
fact
its
the
warming
effect

the

that
makes
this
such
a
great

but
shares
the
complexities
that
make
up
this
style
very
smooth
and
drinkable
but
the
sweetness
gets
a
little
strong
after
a
while
i
think
i
had
better
pick
up
a
few
more
of
these
before
they
are
gone
the
beer
pours
a
brown
color
with
a
thick
frothy
cream
colored
head
that
slowly
fades
to
lacing
the
aroma
is
good
it
has
a
nice
malty
scent
that
boasts
of
pale
and
crystal
malts
along
with
a
dry
yet
fruity
belgian
yeast
aroma
the
scent
is
sweet
and
creamy
very
nice
the
taste
is
great
it
has
a
very
smooth
and
rich
malty
flavor
with
a
sweet
and
warm
finish
it
is
full
of
flavor
and
malt
complexity
the
mouthfeel
is
excellent
as
well
it
is
a
full
bodied
beer
with
adequate
carbonation
this
is
a
damn
good
beer
it
is
full
of
flavor
and
aroma
a
great
drinker
nice
mohagany
color
with
a
creamy
tan
head
it
has
a
good
level
of
carbonation
but
note
quite
as
much
as
other
belgians
the
aroma
is
semisweet
malty
and
caramellike
it
has
a
fresh
herbal
aroma
as
well
there
is
some
fruitiness
in
the
aroma
too
the
flavor
is
sweet
way
more
sweetness
than
i
was
expecting
the
flavor
is
way
malty
with
caramel
and
dark
fruits
toward
the
finish
oh
and
coming
in
at
11
there
is
the
alcohol
in
the
finish
it
is
fullbodied
with
a
creamy
texture
the
alcohol
is
definitly
there
but
not
as
boozing
as
one
might
expect
from
a
highoctane
brew
such
as
this
it
is
a
very
nice
brew
the
maltiness
is
a
big
surprise
for
me
different
than
most
belgians
ive
had
i
will
drink
this
one
again
a
high
quality
brew
that
pleasantly
surprisingly
made
the
lcbo
fall
list
its
only
drawback
is
the
knockout
alcohol
punch
georgeous
brown
barleywine
and
quality
yeast
aroma
great
taste
in
my
favorite
style
hops
fruit
and
sugary
malt
good
night
the
murky
apperance
in
the
chalice
with
its
light
tan
head
is
a
sight
to
behold
the
sweet
fruity
aroma
and
that
first
alcohol
blast
just
have
to
be
experienced
the
yeasty
malty
taste
reminds
me
of
the
sweet
dough
bread
my
grandmother
used
to
make
the
11
stands
out
like
a
sore
thumb
but
coupled
with
the
nose
and
taste
that
makes
this
an
amazing
beer
when
franklin
said
beer
is
proof
that
god
love
us
and
wants
us
to
be
happy
almost
black
color
and
formed
a
small
light
tan
bubbly
head
that
coated
the
glass
with
lace
as
it
subsided
a
medium
amount
of
carbonation
is
present
an
aroma
of
malt
but
overall
i
must
say
i
expected
much
more
rastacouerefeb

dark
caramel
malts
and
the

a
winsome
tan
the
aftertaste
quite
dry
and
sweet
is
something
else
i
could
not
get
beyond
the
overpowering
sweetness
of
this
beer
and
if
there
is
any
redeeming
quality
to
this
thing
its
actually
pretty
damn
good
the
beer
finishes
with
a
semi
sweet
aftertaste
drinkability
is
there
though
i
caution
against
taking
up
on
it
this
is
no
baby
beer
2003
this
was
probably
my
favorite
beer
of
the
tasting
and
a

with

head
lots
going
on
in
the
aroma
fruit
and
combines
with
its
very
fine
and
a
finish
that
is
lightly
bitter
the
bitter
seems
to
be
as
much
from
the
high
alcohol
as
from
the
hops
it
has
quite
a
thick
body
that
gently
caresses
and
coats
the
mouth
in
it
soothing
embrace
this
is
quite
a
good
beer
maybe
some
currant
to
round
out
the
sweetness
this
beer
is
all
sweet
and
it
hides
the

well
in
the
taste

for
this
beer
i
just
cant

it
i
can

with
one
word
todd
wrote
this
is

three
of
my

beers
of

this
is
the
port

without
being

i
have
one
left
in

cellar
and
the
distributor
has
been
out
for
the

6
months
dear
god
i
hope
they
get
more
in
time
i
would
put
this
head
to
head
against
any
trappist
for
malt
complexity
enjoyability
and
price
a
donker

brewed
in
1999
mine
was
a
dark

predominantly
recalls
a

thankfully
it

not
a
bad
beer
but
i
can
do
better
at
this

point
boozy
and
not
enough
carbonation
for
my
liking
those
the
toasted

arrive
in
the
taste
punctuated
by
a
vibrant

tart

flavor
mellow
on
the
palate
lingers
dryly
at

like

i

strong
yeast
hint
of

overall
poor
appearance
and
the
astringency

notes
are
unpleasant
so
the
point
of
my
long
winded
review
is
dont
serve
this
beer
too
cold
5060
degrees
is
what
i
would
recommend
killer
quad
darker
than
expected
with
an
appealing
nose
rich
in
the
tongue
with
afternotes
of
fruit
and
molasses
incredibly
smooth
for
a
quad
this
beer
goes
down
too
easily
a
pleasure
to
drink
and
i
look
forward
to
the
next
visit
400th
beer
and
well
worth
it
one
of
the
best
beers
ive
had
in
a
while
lovely
appearance
and
nose
and
a
taste
that
i
could
go
back
to
over
and
over
again
omg
open
the

and
the
aroma
hits
you
in

dont

less

in
both
the
nose
and

than
what
i
expected
while
less
complex
than
other
quads
this
is
extremely
enjoyable
and
i
would
definitely
seek
out
again
the
flavor
on
the

is
a

its

my

what
can
i
say
this
is
a
challenging
complex
beer
if
you
are
looking
for
something
to
go
with
your
roasted
wild
boar
shank
with
sherry
reduction
and
shiitake
mushroom
risotto
look
elsewhere
this
beer
is
all
about
sipping
enjoying
and
focusing
on
the
beer
the
brew
the
amazing
tastes
that
come
from
barley
malt
hops
and
water
thats
what
this
baby
is
all
about
this
beer
will
make
you
want
to
understand
what
is
going
on
with
it
to
hold
its
hand
and
comprehend
it
what
does
it
want
what
do
we
all
want
wow
highly
recommended
did
i
mention
the
11
abv
cant
detect
it
in
the
taste
anyway
beer
is
mediumheavy
to
heavy
in
body
with
carbonation
of
mediumlow
intensity
resulting
in
a
foamy
12
and
smooth
12
mouthfeel
thats
a
bit
underwhelming
for
the
beer
for
the
style
its
in
an
acceptable
place
ethanol
is
readily
felt
on
the
palate
and
back
of
throat
as
fairly
obvious
burning
and
in
the
nostrils
as
a
notable
warming
sensation
not
subtle
or
pleasant
closes
dry
with
heavy
stickiness
remaining
on
the
palate
and
lips
o
i
would
say
aside
from
the
bitterness
it
was
barely
distinguishable
from
the
donker
if
it
qualifies
as
a
quadrupel
it
doesnt
quite
hit
the
heights
others
do
very
dense
and
caramelized
flavors
with
a
thick
and
sugary
body
this
drinks
very
elegant
the
finish
really
shines
due
to
the
swift
and
spicy
dryness
i
havent
had
this
fresh
but
this
is
drinking
excellent
for
the
year
lots
of
spicy
malt
laced
with
sugary
fruit
i
picture
myself
drinking
this
in
a
tux
with
a
cuban
cigar
after
dinner
really
glad
i
cracked
this
i
just
wish
i
had
another
one
to
hold
onto
for
a
few
more
years
o
this
one
didnt
completely
work
for
me
it
was
just
too
vinegary
i
found
that
sour
alkaline
finish
acrid
it
did
soften
up
a
bit
as
it
sat
and
i
liked
many
of
the
other
qualities
of
the
flavor
profile
like
the
thick
prune
notes
but
i
wont
be
rushing
back
to
cuvée
du
chateau
overall
excellent
really
enjoyed
it
this
sort
of
brew
is
one
of
the
reasons
i
love
going
to
belgium
so
much
overall
this
beer
is
a
bit
on
the
hot
side
at
least
in
the
aftertaste
but
i
like
the
dark
fruit
composition
beers
of
this
style
dont
have
to
work
too
hard
to
be
pretty
tasty
to
me
still
this
guy
is
worth
a
shot
if
you
like
the
style
heavenly
beer
the
taste
is
sweet
with
the
port
taste
also
present
the
berries
and
tartness
remind
me
of
lacto
or
brett
the
beer
is
sweet
but
light
in
a
way
it
is
drinkable
and
not
cloying
at
one
point
the
first
sip
i
suspected
artificial
sweeteners
but
this
beer
is
the
best
beer
from
this
brewery
some
more
residual
sugars
would
have
helped
a
lot
the
finish
is
just
too
much
on
the
dry
side
for
a
dark
fruity
belgian
o
not
the
best
of
the
style
but
the
style
is
the
best
of
beer
good
aroma
good
flavor
average
mouthfeel
just
nothing
that
reallys
stands
up
and
makes
you
say
wow
the
aroma
comes
off
aggresive
but
the
taste
is
more
comforting
to
approach
sweet
with
a
slight
semitartness
the
flavors
of
cherries
red
grapes
dates
and
bread
crust
make
their
mark
a
moderate
dose
of
alcohol
makes
its
presence
especially
when
the
beer
goes
down
and
warms
your
throat
and
tummy
its
a
full
bodied
beer
with
lowmedium
carbonation
drinks
slow
but
steady
and
is
an
adequte
example
of
the
quadruppel
gosh
i
love
a
good
quad
and
this
is
a
good
quad
for
big
robust
complex
flavors
they
just
cannot
be
beat
this
one
has
all
the
attributes
i
look
for
sweet
dark
fruit
big
bready
malt
that
belgian
yeast
flavor
that
always
reminds
me
of
puff
pastry
and
portlike
on
the
palate
its
not
the
best
quad
ive
ever
had
but
it
is
awfully
good
its
like
munching
on
spiced
holiday
cookies
that
have
been
soaked
in
mulled
wine
recommended
o
this
is
a
good
beer
and
a
big
beer
went
well
with
thanksgiving
dinner
the
sharp
bright
and
zesty
citruslike
qualities
of
cuvée
du
chateau
make
this
a
memorable
quadrupel
in
my
book
just
when
i
thought
i
had
this
style
figured
out
i
get
thrown
a
curveballand
a
uniquely
delicious
one
at
that
really
great
beer
delicious
dark
belgian
ale
good
balance
of
flavors
the
strength
makes
it
a
sipper
very
enjoyable
though
and
i
could
have
this
again
and
again
revised
with
march
2013
tasting
of
2011
bottle
d
nice
stuff
but
not
particularly
mindblowing
or
distinct
from
a
number
of
other
quads
i
like
the
preaged
element
of
this
beer
as
it
cuts
out
some
of
the
harsh
alcohol
and
phenols
i
get
from
fresh
quads
not
sure
how
this
is
done
but
its
a
nifty
idea
easily
the
best
thing
ive
had
from
van
honsebrouck
but
thats
kind
of
faint
praise
bottle
at
stubbies
in
gainesville
pours
very
dark
with
slight
head
heavy
alcohol
smell
mixed
in
with
plums
and
raisins
maybe
some
pear
definitely
lets
you
know
it
is
11
but
this
does
not
overpower
the
complex
prunechocolate
combo
that
bursts
on
the
palate
nice
sweetness
molasses
candy
sugar
felt
it
going
to
my
head
after
just
one
a
must
try
for
quad
fans
this
one
should
be
talked
about
more
a
for
me
this
is
overly
sweet
though
complicated
that
i
can
hardly
finish
a
bottle
myself
its
more
like
personal
preference
i
suppose
drinkability
is
dangerously
high
this
is
a
fantastic
beer
absolutely
world
class
it
may
have
equals
but
is
unsurpassable
o
this
is
definitely
not
a
beer
wimps
its
big
strong
and
forceful
its
also
well
made
and
totally
drinkable
overall
a
nice
quad
that
hides
the
alcohol
flavor
fairly
well
not
as
complex
as
i
had
figured
but
the
vinous
character
is
interesting
and
helps
the
body
not
seem
so
heavy
getting
past
the
notion
that
belgian
ales
must
provide
the
effervescent
champagnelike
dryness
and
evaporating
candish
sweetness
a
savory
sipping
beer
can
be
every
bit
as
complex
and
satisfying
to
the
stomach
and
taste
buds
honsebrouck
has
proved
this
with
their
time
honored
kasteel
donker
but
really
showcases
the
phenomenon
with
cuvee
du
chateau
overall
a
nice
quad
easily
drinkable
not
in
my
top
5
quads
but
still
very
good
i
think
i
paid
4
99
total
wine
and
more
for
this
beer
and
it
was
worth
every
penny
i
could
easily
see
this
going
for
810
on
tap
and
id
gladly
pay
it
nice
quad
very
smooth
colorful
flavor
enjoyed
this
vintage
immensely

i

sweet

as

flavors
become
more

and
buddybuddy
with
my
palate
very
nice
brew
o
better
than
the
sum
of
its
parts
while
this
certainly
isnt
an
everyday
beer
it
is
excellent
on
a
cold
dark
night
while
i
think
its
pretty
solid
right
now
a
few
years
would
do
this
beer
wonders
i
anticipate
in
another
46
years
this
will
be
flat
out
phenomenal
if
youre
a
fan
of
the
style
its
certainly
worth
trying
especially
at
the
excellent
price
of
9
for
a
750
ml
well
done
in
all
dimensions
not
a
brew
for
daily
drink
but
perfect
for
special
occasion
and
time
overall
not
bad
there
are
plenty
better
belgian
quads
out
there
but
this
is
decent
all
things
considered
most
other
kasteel
beers
ive
had
were
also
better
o
i
had
decently
high
hopes
for
this
when
i
found
it
at
my
specialty
liquor
store
i
was
more
than
disappointed
im
not
impressed
with
it
especially
because
its
a
quadrupel
the
flavors
dont
seem
to
harmonize
with
each
other
its
not
awful
but
i
cant
find
a
lot
of
redeeming
qualities
in
it
quads
are
one
of
my
favorite
styles
and
i
was
disappointed
in
it
o
this
is
a
real
nice
to
drink
evening
warmer
bottle
from
half
time
poured
a
clear
reddish
brown
with
a
small
lasting
tan
head
aromas
of
toffee
plum
dates
and
yeast
mouthfeel
was
medsium
to
full
bodied
and
smooth
flavors
of
toffee
cola
dark
fruit
and
yeast
with
a
smooth
lingering
cola
finish
if
this
beer
tasted
more
like
it
smelled
it
would
be
a
much
better
offering
maybe
a
year
or
two
of
aging
would
really
work
wonders
for
this
one
note
bottled
on
7142010
delicious
must
try
medium
bodied
with
soft
carbonation
and
a
strong
zesty
spice
presence
up
front
that
lingers
over
a
chewy
roasted
malt
character
and
estery
dark
fruits
into
a
slightly
dry
finish
theres
a
nice
balance
of
pepper
medicinal
syrup
chocolate
cake
lightly
roasted
coffee
plum
raisin
and
grape
fuller
bodied
with
a
much
stronger
malt
presence
than
i
expected
also
the
high
abv
is
excellently
masked
resulting
in
a
flavorful
beer
thats
easy
to
put
down
good
but
id
like
to
see
how
their
donker
is
poured
a
dark
mahogany
color
with
a
small
cap
of
offwhite
head
caramel
and
brown
sugar
in
the
nose
lots
of
dark
dried
fruit
decent
aroma
but
not
too
pronounced
the
taste
follows
the
nose
for
the
most
part
with
dark
caramel
honey
brown
sugar
plums
raisins
figs
black
cherries
and
a
subtle
hint
of
cocoa
in
the
background
actually
a
bit
similar
to
kasteel
rouge
in
some
ways
but
a
bit
more
complex
array
of
flavors
thick
in
the
mouth
heavymedium
body
kind
of
syrupy
low
carbonation
and
a
definite
alcohol
warmth
that
balances
out
the
thickness
a
bit
quite
enjoyable
and
id
like
to
sample
it
again
drinkabiliy
good
beer
in
the
belgian
style
but
too
sweet
for
my
taste
ofor
the
price
this
is
not
a
bad
beer
i
will
drink
it
again
for
sure
o
a
decent
beer
to
have
with
dark
meat
like
burgers
steak
ribs
that
kind
of
thing
im
going
to
have
a
cheese
steak
in
an
hour
and
i
probably
should
have
cooked
it
earlier
it
would
have
paired
nicely
good
health
to
you
when
i
heard
of
this
that
it
is
brewed
to
resemble
the
flavor
of
an
aged
kasteel
donker
i
wondered
first
how
you
would
do
that
and
then
if
you
could
why
not
make
that
the
original
beer
i
dont
have
answers
for
any
of
those
questions
all
i
can
say
is
that
they
did
it
and
its
wonderful
a
lovely
spiked
plum
pudding
of
a
brew
a
laced
liquid
licorice
whip
and
a
toasty
tasty
caramel
and
toffee
confection
rolling
happily
in
the
mouth
all
in
one
and
all
very
mellow
very
groovy

drinkability
is
reasonably
good
here
its
just
a
touch
too
sweet
to
be
exceptional
and
sure
enough
is
miles
away
from
the
leffe
offering
not
something
to
actively
look
for
but
a
brew
that
i
would
have
gladly
again

a
bit
sweet
for
me
d
i
think
its
cool
that
this
beer
was
brewed
when
i
was
in
high
school
that
being
said
i
didnt
really
get
anything
except
a
drier
version
of
the
donker
thats
fine
i
guess
i
just
expected
more
d
this
provided
me
with
a
wonderful
sipping
experience
while
enjoying
my
visit
to
ebenezers
this
wasnt
as
crazy
and
inyourface
as
i
was
expecting
instead
i
was
treated
to
a
rare
and
delicious
blend
of
cherries
and
oak
i
should
note
that
i
feel
that
this
beer
deserves
a
higher
overall
rating
than
the
individual
scores
i
have
given
it
sum
great
than
the
parts
and
all
that
this
is
a
very
good
beer
that
fans
of
belgian
and
english
styles
should
seek
out
as
well
as
those
who
appreciate
what
aging
in
a
barrel
can
do
to
improve
a
beer
had
on
tap
at
monks
cafe
in
philadelphia
poured
deep
reddish
black
into
a
tulip
with
a
thick
creamy
head
absolutely
beautiful
color
of
a
dark
red
wine
smell
was
equally
impressive
fruity
and
malty
bitter
cherry
and
caramel
notes
taste
starts
sweet
and
fruity
malty
with
some
vanilla
too
finish
is
tart
cherry
and
belgian
hops
mild
carbonation
fantastic
beer
10
years
of
aging
has
done
this
one
well
thick
full
bodied
robust
booze
is
definitely
warming
this
beer
came
out
of
nowhere
very
very
good
beer
overall
if
these
guys
were
back
home
in
wi
i
would
be
broke
sweet
but
too
alcohol
forward
big
thank
you
to
dutesanch
for
sending
me
this
delicious
quad
in
a
trade
ive
probably
tried
8
quads
in
my
day
and
this
one
by
far
was
the
best
i
drank
it
with
a
blackened
pork
chop
marinated
in
a
small
batch
know
creek
sauce
with
white
beans
and
peppers
you
will
not
regret
buying
this
quad
the
taste
is
savory
with
hints
of
molasses
and
oak
delicious
overall
really
nice
this
is
certainly
a
very
sweet
beer
with
a
massive
og
and
only
22
ibu
so
it
might
not
be
for
everyone
the
people
i
shared
it
with
all
found
it
to
be
too
much
i
love
me
some
malt
bombs
though
especially
if
its
got
a
good
barrel
component
to
go
along
with
it
and
this
one
certainly
delivered
in
both
departments
lots
of
good
flavor
and
a
big
feel
to
go
with
it
the
head
could
use
a
little
work
but
whatever
thanks
again
scotto
enjoyed
this
one
i
like
this
sticky
monkey
beer
overall
very
nice
so
much
great
characters
but
hard
to
drink
much
of
it
since
its
so
sweet
and
boozy
def
a
winter
sipper
so
glad
i
didnt
wait
until
it
was
warmer
out
also
wish
the
barrel
came
through
a
bit
more
but
i
def
like
the
vanilla
and
aging
effect
it
has
like
every
barrelaged
firestone
walker
beer
i
have
had
this
exhibits
an
excellent
balance
and
similar
barrel
characteristics
and
mouth
feel
to
most
of
their
other
barrel
aged
beers
exceptionally
smooth
for
the
abv
and
i
mean
exceptionally
not
extremely
quadish
if
thats
a
word
but
somewhere
between
that
and
a
stout
just
too
boozy
and
syrupy
for
me
favorite
beer
by
far
cant
wait
for
another
bottle
all
i
can
say
is
what
a
pleasure
to
drink
this
beer
definitely
met
my
expectations
boozy
sweet
bottle
of
goodness
velvety
and
slightly
hot
from
the
high
abv
with
flavors
of
vanilla
up
front
and
the
burbontoffee
finish
sugar
is
present
but
less
pronounced
than
fresh
bottlespours
aging
well
2014
version
pour
is
a
thick
brownishblack
it
will
be
a
little
surprising
for
a
quad
fan
head
forms
only
around
the
sides
but
securely
aroma
is
a
deep
bourbony
vanillai
inhaled
several
times
before
consuming
feel
is
purely
robust
with
barrel
sweetness
dominating
the
taste
its
so
rich
a
slow
drink
is
required
if
you
happen
to
consuming
all
22
oz
alone
while
both
being
different
styles
i
find
the
overall
feel
and
taste
to
be
a
mix
of
bcbs
and
backwoods
bastard
overall
a
unique
pleasure
to
drink
not
a
huge
quad
fan
but
enjoyed
this
incredibly
sweet
i
dont
think
i
could
handle
more
than
6oz
this
was
just
a
bit
much
for
when
i
drank
it
good
but
strong
boozy
flavor
o
a
wonderful
sipper
a
rival
for
bcbs
different
of
course
because
its
a
quad
with
some
dark
fruit
undertones
instead
of
roasty
malt
but
in
both
cases
the
bourbon
flavor
dominates
beautifully
first
barley
wine
versions
were
better
overall
a
damn
fine
brew
tastes
like
drinking
a
vanilla
toffee
super
sweet
super
smooth
the
abv
is
completely
unnoticeable
overall
i
do
not
like
this
one
as
much
as
sucaba
but
fw
still
did
a
darn
good
job
here
five
out
of
five
o
this
is
one
of
the
best
quads
i
have
ever
had
every
barrel
aged
that
firestone
does
they
nail
it
i
am
looking
forward
to
this
next
year
in
a
league
of
its
own
absolutely
perfect
and
unique
with
some
many
delicious
flavors
coming
through
firestone
walker
does
it
again
it
is
on
the
sweet
side
quad
with
great
complexity
and
intense
molasses
dark
fruits
and
lots
of
coconuts
leather
and
cherries
nummy
could
definitely
use
some
aging
the
alcohol
took
a
bit
to
get
past
overall
quite
enjoyable
a
slow
sipper
of
a
beer
of
course
but
worth
the
alcohol
and
sugar
investment
solid
lots
of
barrel
figs
and
toffee
think
some
time
might
help
the
barrel
integrate
better
as
it
seemed
a
bit
disjointed
but
as
always
im
likely
full
of
shit
overall
a
very
good
beer
not
sure
how
to
classify
it
but
i
like
it
overall
great
stuff
i
prefer
these
central
coast
quads
much
more
than
the
northern
and
southern
varieties
had
it
on
tap
at
fwbarrelworks
strong
delicious
and
boozy
just
going
to
say
if
id
never
tasted
saucerful
o
secrets
this
would
be
my
favorite
quad
this
beer
is
supremely
drinkable
o
stickee
monkee
indeed
well
done
a
very
drinkable
quad
that
would
make
a
wonderful
sipper
on
a
cold
night
or
as
a
desert
beer
i
really
like
this
one
oa
really
good
quad
one
of
the
few
that
deviates
from
the
primarily
dark
fruits
profile
rather
yummy
delicious
and
smooth
my
first
review
i
am
reviewing
based
off
of
memory
unfortunately
and
basically
what
i
remember
is
that
this
beer
is
the
shit
my
favorite
of
the
barrel
aged
series
super
sweet
and
delicious
like
i
love
and
that
is
my
highlyqualified
review
of
my
favorite
firestone
beer
pours
a
deep
brown
with
a
thin
khaki
head
that
lasts
for
seconds
before
disappearing
very
little
carbonation
and
the
beer
is
completely
opaque
save
for
the
edges
the
nose
is
quite
amazing
i
got
brown
sugar
molasses
bourbon
vanilla
a
hint
of
roastiness
and
dark
fruits
the
taste
is
vanilla
bourbon
with
a
prominent
sweetness
and
subtle
hints
of
fruitiness
the
finish
is
full
and
smooth
as
could
be
next
to
no
carbonation
leaves
a
heavy
mouthfeel
and
a
thickness
to
the
body
its
a
definite
sipper
but
more
than
worth
the
experience
o
more
like
a
beeraged
barrel
this
brewery
hits
the
mark
too
much
they
seem
to
have
a
distinct
flavor
to
their
barrelaged
beers
and
its
intoxicating
not
to
mention
the
beer
if
you
like
expertlycrafted
strong
malty
beers
you
may
commit
crimesagainsthumanity
for
this
one
most
certainly
an
engaging
sensory
tussle
happy
birthday
to
me
overall
i
am
not
going
to
touch
the
quadenglish
barleywine
debate
on
this
beer
but
will
just
look
at
it
on
its
merits
for
all
the
malt
and
barrel
treatment
here
the
beer
lacks
the
complexity
in
my
view
to
merit
the
high
scores
that
it
has
achieved
some
of
the
scoring
has
to
do
with
the
brewers
reputation
and
while
this
is
a
good
sipper
it
is
not
among
firestone
walkers
best
it
might
be
interesting
to
see
how
this
ages
once
the
heat
diminishes
the
flavor
follows
with
that
burst
of
plums
dates
and
raisins
up
front
along
with
caramelized
brown
sugar
the
beer
is
quite
sweet
but
that
firestone
oak
character
dries
out
the
beer
the
beer
tastes
nothing
towards
13
and
is
dangerously
drinkable
firestone
does
barrel
aging
very
well
o
its
amazing
that
a
beer
this
rife
with
residual
sweetness
is
even
drinkable
true
to
its
name
this
is
one
big
and
sticky
sipping
beer
the
wellrounded
barrel
character
distracts
the
palate
away
from
all
the
sweetness
enough
to
keep
it
from
going
over
the
edge
they
bill
this
as
a
central
coast
quad
but
if
you
are
expecting
anything
resembling
the
trappist
classics
such
as
rochefort
10
or
chimay
grande
reserve
you
will
be
completely
confounded
it
comes
across
more
as
a
huge
sticky
barleywine
in
the
past
this
beer
was
used
only
for
blending
purposes
and
with
its
ridiculous
sweetness
its
not
hard
to
see
why
however
this
is
one
of
the
rare
instances
in
which
a
blending
beer
can
stand
on
its
own
two
feet
even
if
it
is
teetering
on
the
edge
of
drinkability
brinksmanship
at
its
finest
bomber
poured
into
a
snifter
the
brew
appears
a
clear
mahogany
color
with
an
offwhite
cap
that
holds
fairly
well
fading
leaving
patchy
lace
the
aroma
contains
notes
of
sweet
caramel
and
toffee
malt
a
slight
kiss
of
bourbon
is
present
across
the
back
the
taste
is
reminescent
of
raison
and
plum
caramel
and
toffee
round
things
out
with
a
yeasty
spiciness
this
is
medium
bodied
and
modestly
carbonated
a
fine
sipper
and
good
representation
of
a
barrel
aged
quad
id
drink
it
again
if
the
opportunity
presented
itself
overall
great
tastes
like
a
ba
barleywine
like
a
less
hot
sucaba
and
nothing
like
a
quad
in
my
opinion
does
not
taste
13

abv
at
all
super
smooth
bourbon
is
sweet
and
delicious
as
is
all
the
caramel
and
toffee
would
love
to
get
a
bottle
of
it
overall
i
like
this
quad
just
as
much
as
fws
sucaba
and
parabola
cheers
o
although
this
one
blurs
the
lines
a
bit
between
a
barrel
aged
barleywine
and
a
quad
it
is
clearly
a
fantastic
beer
look
forward
to
finding
another
bottle
overall
when
i
first
had
this
beer
at
the
2010
pizza
port
strong
ale
festival
it
was
classified
as
an
english
barleywine
call
it
central
coast
quad
or
whatever
else
to
me
it
is
a
very
good
bourbon
balaged
maltcentered
beer
sweet
but
with
enough
complexity
to
not
be
cloying
in
the
least
d
another
fine
fireside
sipper
from
the
proprietors
vintage
series
with
its
full
malt
body
high
abv
and
layers
of
barrel
aged
complexity
signature
fw
barreling
at
work
here
with
those
lovely
vanilla
and
toasted
coconut
components
with
such
a
mild
belgian
yeast
presence
however
this
drinks
more
like
an
english
barleywine
in
fact
i
would
prefer
this
over
the
sucaba
damn
just
another
wallet
thumper
to
add
in
my
lineup
dark
brown
not
much
head
smells
herbal
and

is
surprisingly
balanced
dry

pretty
fullbodied

another
fantastic
barrelaged
beer
from
firestone
walker
its
not
my
favorite
of
the
portfolio
but
i
like
the
fact
that
it
brings
a
slightly
different
perspective
with
quintessential
characteristics
of
traditional
belgian
quads
a
very
good
attempt
at
a
difficult
style
but
sorry
this
does
not
compare
to
the
belgian
originals
ogreat
ba
quad
one
of
the
best
i
have
ever
had
definitely
a
tasty
beer
but
i
wish
the
dark
fruit
flavors
would
carry
through
to
the
end
o
net
sweet
but
extraordinarily
well
put
together
firestone
walkers
proprietors
vintage
series
is
simply
outstanding
and
stickee
monkee
pulls
its
weight
in
what
i
would
argue
is
the
best
signature
series
in
brewing
very
sweet
a
little
syrupy
and
a
little
too
hot
for
me
reviewing
from
memory
had
on
tap
at
monks
café
served
in
a
tulip
aromas
are
boozey
mostly
brandy
some
coacoa
and
dark
fruits
as
well
on
the
palate
a
brownie
type
chocolatiness
with
the
brandy
or
rum
soaked
quality
raisin
coacoa
maybe
a
hint
of
coffee
very
sticky
and
thick
like
the
name
would
suggest
a
hint
of
hop
to
balance
things
out
and
a
little
heat
really
complex
and
warming
beer
firestone
rarely
disappoints
doesnt
here
either
an
excellent
barleywine
quad
sorry
overall
very
complex
and
a
great
american
representation
of
a
belgian
quad
on
the
sweet
side
a
little
more
than
the
usual
quad
very
nice
nonetheless
overall
20
thick
rich
mouthfeel
with
low
to
medium
carbonation
yet
another
great
great
beer
from
fws
top
notch
barrel
aging
program
overall
a
real
nice
take
on
a
quad
with
classic
firestone
touch
yet
another
big
winner
from
firestone
walkers
barrel
program
this
one
was
truly
unique
and
unlike
anything
ive
tasted
pours
nice
rich
brown
color
almost
mahogany
nose
is
sweet
and
honey
like
this
is
sweet
and
high
abv
without
a
doubt
taste
follows
nose
and
more
almost
tastes
like
a
piece
of
candy
toffee
indeed
smooth
and
oaky
like
a
fine
whiskey
mouthfeel
is
glorious
and
rich
overall
a
rich
unforgettable
brew
overall
a
very
enjoyable
quad
maybe
i
just
enjoy
americanized
beers
more
but
this
was
one
of
my
favorite
quads
i
have
had
the
coconut
flavors
were
awesome
worth
the
hype
more
of
a
barleywine
than
a
quad
though
although
i
suspect
thats
what
they
are
getting
at
by
calling
it
a
central
coast
quad
instead
of
a
belgian
one
but
it
exhibits
a
whole
lot
more
barleywine
to
me
nevermind
definitions
and
classifications
though
this
is
insanely
good
beer
deep
but
royal
redbrown
in
color
like
good
root
beer
in
shade
but
super
thick
and
viscous
sticky
as
taffy
and
not
very
carbonated
but
it
doesnt
need
to
be
the
nose
on
this
is
all
grain
caramelized
malt
sugars
abound
with
notes
of
toffee
and
butterscotch
raisin
plum
fig
molasses
honey
and
bourbon
right
from
the
bottle
its
intensely
boozy
but
in
a
refined
and
intentional
way
i
get
the
malt
layering
expected
in
a
quad
but
the
lack
of
any
real
belgian
yeast
character
in
the
flavor
puts
this
squarely
in
the
barleywine
world
for
me
scorching
sugars
and
vanilla
bourbon
predominate
but
it
never
really
ends
up
all
the
sweet
considering
how
much
sugar
is
in
here
mid
palate
oak
mellows
it
for
sure
and
the
booze
cuts
it
well
i
think
layers
and
layers
of
grain
nuance
keep
coming
i
absolutely
love
it
i
was
so
sad
to
have
missed
the
bottles
when
they
came
around
so
i
am
thankful
to
hops
and
pie
for
giving
me
the
chance
to
finally
try
this
one
on
tap
its
worthy
of
its
high
praise
very
firestone
walker
too
very
barreled
and
big
just
delicious
big
beer
here
a
musty
try
more
interesting
than
sucaba
i
think
but
thats
just
me
this
is
fantastic
the
overall
presence
of
all
the
combined
elements
result
in
a
transcendent
epic
ale
pours
a
heavy
dark
brown
smells
of
bread
liquorish
brown
sugar
cigar
taste
is
figgy
soy
sauce
vanilla
sugar
cane
and
leather
with
a
toasty
background
mouthful
is
heavy
think
and
boozy
but
smooth
with
buttery
velvet
texture
truly
a
world
class
creation
o
awesome
beer
will
definitely
drink
again
the
combination
of
lots
of
time
to
kill
and
a
recent
paycheck
means
i
can
afford
to
pick
up
a
bottle
of
stickee
monkee
at
the
bar
lets
do
this
shit
it
pours
a
clear
sunset
topazsienna
topped
by
a
finger
or
so
of
sandstone
foam
the
nose
comprises
caramelized
belgian
candi
sugar
mild
molasses
toasted
oak
toasted
coconut
light
connecticut
tobacco
graham
cracker
clove
light
allspice
and
a
hint
of
candied
orange
peel
the
taste
brings
in
more
of
the
same
the
oak
spices
and
sweet
elements
taking
full
command
in
a
lovely
display
of
cooperation
a
small
faction
of
booze
enters
into
the
equation
but
it
is
mostly
drowned
out
by
the
delicious
din
around
it
the
body
is
a
hefty
medium
with
a
light
moderate
carbonation
and
a
lightlysyrupy
feel
overall
a
damn
fine
beer
well
worth
my
investment
and
anyone
elses
for
that
matter
get
some
incredibly
complex
and
very
damn
tasty
my
local
craft
beer
bartender
got
one
of
75
cases
shipped
to
nyc
he
promised
me
one
bottle
and
is
keeping
the
rest
for
next
year
thank
you
amazing
and
well
worth
the
price
tag
looks
and
feels
more
like
a
ba
stout
than
a
quad
the
carbonation
and
presence
of
stone
fruit
flavors
are
the
biggest
quad
qualities
it
has
the
high
abv
is
masked
quite
well
this
beer
lives
up
to
the
hype
and
is
another
amazing
example
of
fine
ba
from
firestone
overall
this
is
truly
unique
and
cant
be
categorized
a
perfect
dessert
sipper
best
way
i
can
relate
to
it
is
a
cross
between
a
quad
and
a
stout
if
you
made
monkey
bread
into
a
beer
from
heaven
this
would
be
it
o
wow
could
be
my
favorite
beer
ever
tried
o
for
two
years
i
thought
nothing
could
ever
surpass
parabola
as
the
quintessential
bba
beer
but
this
may
have
just
changed
my
mind
fsw
has
once
again
created
art
something
so
magnificent
that
you
should
have
it
sparingly
lest
you
grow
inured
to
its
greatness
drink
this
was
a
good
beer
took
me
a
while
to
find
this
one
in
so
cal
missed
out
on
bottles
so
tap
was
a
great
solution
for
me
was
lucky
to
have
during
a
tap
takeover
i
found
on
accident
easily
one
of
the
best
beers
ive
ever
had
well
worth
the
wait
and
price
o
elegant
drinking
experience
on
the
sweet
side
dont
know
what
kind
of
barrels
were
used
but
the
alcoholic
airs
are
rumlike
as
mentioned
i
think
it
was
a
17
bottle
for
me
and
its
worth
it
o
unusually
i
actually
preferred
this
beer
at
the
start
and
found
it
a
bit
onedimensional
by
the
bottom
of
the
bottle
in
terms
of
style
its
not
an
orthodox
quad
but
its
certainly
closer
to
quad
than
english
barleywine
territory
i
havent
had
a
beer
quite
like
it
and
from
my
perspective
its
a
bit
of
an
enigma
perhaps
the
most
remarkable
aspect
of
this
beer
is
its
drinkability
at
13
4
i
was
expecting
a
lot
more
heat
overall
another
incredible
ba
beer
from
firestone
walker
a
previous
reviewer
used
the
term
rum
taste
which
fits
perfectly
low
carbonation
high
maltsweet
and
a
rum
boozy
aftertaste
with
warm
lingering
flavours
is
a
simple
summary
this
is
a
great
sipper
as
the
taste
is
so
rich
and
full
another
wonderful
complex
beer
by
firestone
overall
a
top
notch
american
quad
with
tons
of
depth
and
character
ill
definitely
be
grabbing
a
bottle
next
year
4
55
im
done
this
is
excellence
this
is
a
powerful
beer
but
with
none
of
the
rough
edges
you
get
with
many
american
brewed
big
belgians
great
stuff
o
generally
im
not
a
bourbon
barrel
whore
but
this
is
damn
fine
drinks
like
a
fine
wine
wish
i
had
someone
to
share
the
bottle
with
because
the
13
is
going
to
pack
a
punch
after
650ml
overall
man
this
is
a
hell
of
a
brew
im
not
a
big
quad
fan
because
i
find
them
cloyingly
sweet
and
with
too
syrupy
a
body
conversely
i
find
many
ba
brews
suffer
from
beer
that
may
not
be
big
and
complex
enough
to
withstand
the
barrel
aging
process
leaving
an
end
product
thats
overwrought
with
too
much
booziness
to
me
this
is
one
is
a
perfect
marriage
big
flavors
that
arent
overwhelmed
by
the
bourbon
influence
while
the
normally
thick
and
syrupy
quad
body
is
thinned
out
nicely
delivering
a
smooth
and
approachable
quality
of
drink
the
end
result
is
something
like
a
ba
blended
barleywine
and
its
wonderful
glad
i
picked
up
a
2nd
bottle
for
aging
should
be
fun
to
revisit
poured
from
a
22
oz
bottle
into
a
belgian
tulip
glass
overall
another
stellar
firestone
damn
this
is
good
call
it
a
quad
or
call
it
a
barleywine
whatever
you
name
it
it
is
rich
smooth
dark
stone
fruit
brown
sugar
malty
goodness
it
goes
down
way
too
easily
for
a
beer
of
this
weight
o
best
bourbon
barrel
quad
i
have
ever
had
incredibly
drinkable
fw
kills
it
again
this
is
another
great
ba
offering
from
fw
it
does
not
disappoint
o
again
fw
hits
a
home
run
a
little
cheaper
than
some
of
the
other
releases
but
still
sold
out
everywhere
in
like
a
day
cant
wait
to
see
how
this
ages
definitely
a
sipper
hard
to
imagine
drinking
a
lot
of
this
but
a
small
glass
after
dinner
for
dessert
would
be
perfect
firestone
walker
really
has
their
barrel
program
cranking
on
all
cylinders
poured
a
dark
brown
no
light
getting
through
with
an
off
while
head
classic
firestone
walker
barrel
aged
beer
huge
vanilla
and
toasted
coconut
notes
underlined
with
toffee
caramel
and
burnt
sugar
taste
mirrors
the
smell
smooth
as
hell
and
decently
viscous
a
nice
little
bourbon
heat
that
sticks
with
you
at
the
end
if
there
is
one
complaint
its
that
this
doesnt
really
do
much
to
differentiate
from
other
firestone
barrel
aged
beers
if
i
was
blind
folded
and
told
to
guess
between
this
and
sucaba
id
have
a
hard
time
telling
them
apart
like
i
said
not
much
of
a
complaint
because
they
are
both
great
poured
into
a
fremont
small
snifter
pours
a
very
dark
mahogany
brown
appearing
opaque
in
the
glass
with
a
fine
half
finger
light
brown
head
with
good
retention
and
nice
lacing
aroma
dominated
by
oak
and
bourbon
with
light
supporting
dark
fresh
and
dried
fruit
and
caramel
really
a
barrel
aged
barleywine
profile
flavor
is
sweet
syrup
vanilla
caramel
dark
dried
fruit
light
stone
fruit
oak
and
bourbon
full
almost
syrupy
bodied
with
little
carbonation
presence
on
the
tongue
a
very
interesting
flavor
in
the
finish
almost
like
a
fine
fruit
reduction
flavorful
but
indescribable
this
has
quad
sweetness
but
the
heavier
fruit
of
a
barleywine
but
without
the
heavy
malt
flavors
a
unique
and
tasty
definition
breaking
strong
ale
quite
sweet
and
little
hop
presence
a
perfect
desert
ale
world
class
lucky
enough
to
have
an
extra
for
the
basement
and
look
forward
to
this
with
a
few
years
on
it
bottle
from
doug
thanks
man
pours
dark
amber
brownish
purple
with
a
small
yellowish
head
that
recedes
pretty
quickly
aroma
of
big
time
bourbon
and
vanilla
caramel
toffee
figs
other
dark
fruits
smells
like
a
ba
old
ale
flavor
is
massive
bourbon
notes
with
a
smooth
vanilla
finish
dark
fruits
behind
the
booze
some
big
oaky
notes
and
lots
of
brown
sugar
molasses
caramel
and
toffee
not
much
belgian
quad
going
on
here
but
i
suspect
they
werent
going
for
that
anyway
big
rich
mouthfeel
with
lowish
carbonation
lots
of
booze
but
still
very
smooth
with
a
lingering
vanilla
and
dark
fruits
on
the
palate
mmmm
super
glad
this
longtime
draft
only
rarity
finally
found
its
way
into
a
bottle
stickee
monkee
does
a
great
job
almost
bridging
the
gap
between
two
of
my
favorite
styles
i
believe
that
its
less
a
fullon
quad
and
more
an
english
barleywine
with
quad
elements
but
no
matter
what
you
call
it
this
is
a
sweet
multifaceted
delicious
treat
i
would
love
to
accumulate
multiples
for
enjoyment
both
now
and
it
the
coming
months
years
another
fantastic
beast
of
a
beer
and
real
winner
from
firestone
walker
get
it
whileif
you
can
overall
another
rocksolid
barrelaged
beer
from
firestone
walker
ooverall
another
great
ba
beer
from
firestone
a
very
balance
beer
that
is
never
in
full
force
with
bourbon
was
lucky
enough
to
stubble
on
at
tw
since
i
missed
out
on
draft
the
day
before
at
frisco
a
rare
miss
from
firestone
walker
the
elements
are
there
just
not
in
a
pleasing
balance
an
incidental
note
i
have
had
this
one
several
times
on
its
own
over
the
years
but
never
reviewed
it
however
it
doesnt
seem
to
be
very
different
from
how
i
remember
it
fw
knows
barrels
and
how
to
brew
a
good
beer
to
go
in
them
i
said
that
after
parabola
and
sucaba
but
this
is
just
icing
on
the
cake
with
a
belgian
style
sweet
but
not
overly
so
with
big
fruits
and
smooth
vanilla
oak
overall
best
ba
quads
i
have
ever
had
sticks
with
what
they
were
trying
to
achieve
the
one
complaint
is
with
a
higher
abv
i
wanted
it
to
at
some
point
hit
me
in
the
face
a
little
but
the
immense
candy
flavor
masked
that
a
lot
exactly
what
they
wanted
but
not
what
i
wanted
oops
i
have
another
one
cellared
so
i
will
rerate
in
a
couple
years
oo
onot
as
complex
as
some
of
firestone
walkers
other
specialty
beers
its
still
a
really
neat
take
on
a
style
that
i
am
far
from
enamored
with
even
if
it
isnt
my
favorite
from
this
brewery
its
one
of
the
best
quads
i
have
had
overall
good
beer
hides
alcohol
well
has
a
very
nice
and
clean
flavor
and
scent
definitely
worth
trying
o
4
5
this
beer
is
great
almost
on
par
with
sucaba
it
seems
strange
to
be
categorized
as
a
quad
but
a
good
beer
is
a
good
beer
regardless
of
what
the
label
says
o
very
very
good
a
littttle
sweet
for
me
without
a
ton
of
depth
this
will
be
even
better
with
some
age
on
it
im
sure
o
i
like
it
but
my
favorite
is
still
parabola
i
think
it
would
be
alot
better
after
a
year
or
two
but
overall
its
what
i
expected
from
fw
top
class
its
not
mindblowing
but
in
a
year
or
two
this
would
be
my
top
20
i
would
definitely
recommend
anybody
that
is
into
ba
stouts
or
ba
barleywine
cheers
o
i
actually
prefer
this
over
many
of
the
firestone
barrel
aged
brews
because
it
packs
a
bit
more
punch
in
terms
of
flavor
sort
of
like
what
sucaba
wishes
it
was
this
is
now
more
english
bw
than
quad
now
its
got
that
belgianyeast
presence
like
a
quad
but
without
the
spices
the
flavors
are
much
more
in
unison
than
it
was
fresh
the
heats
still
there
but
more
warm
and
inviting
than
it
is
disagreeing
like
it
was
fresh
overall
very
nice
and
may
even
prefer
this
one
over
sucaba
o
seriously
big
and
sweet
quad
barrelaging
is
quite
nice
adding
even
more
complexity
and
sweetness
with
caramel
and
toasted
sugars
loads
of
bourbon
fruit
chocolate
and
sugary
sweetness
whats
not
to
love
i
bet
this
would
age
very
well
im
a
fan
of
the
2014
verdict
a
very
tasty
beer
from
firestone
walker
they
call
it
a
quad
on
the
bottle
in
the
past
ive
seen
it
as
a
barleywine
and
thats
a
bit
of
how
i
think
of
it
hard
to
find
much
in
the
way
of
the
yeasty
goodness
that
makes
up
a
strong
quad
but
this
has
all
the
hallmarks
of
a
great
barleywine
the
alcohol
is
hidden
perfectly
and
is
the
beers
best
asset
the
richness
and
sweetness
is
cut
nicely
by
the
barrel
aging
and
the
complexity
is
right
in
the
sweet
spot
where
its
definitely
layered
but
still
straightforward
enough
to
be
accessible
to
everyone
o
firestone
continues
to
do
something
in
the
ba
program
where
i
feel
its
good
drinking
now
gets
different
as
the
beer
warms
but
the
flavor
profile
doesnt
change
too
much
i
will
sit
on
a
couple
bottles
definitely
up
there
on
par
with
parabola
got
a
few
at
15
99
which
is
very
reasonable
and
would
probably
spend
up
to
20
on
the
bottle
if
i
get
antsy
with
my
other
bottles
and
have
to
get
desperate
well
done
firestone
o
i
would
compare
this
favorably
to
such
favorites
as
bb4d
and
brandy
old
stock
remarkably
wellintegrated
out
of
the
gate
and
with
tons
of
depth
of
flavoraroma
will
absolutely
seek
out
more
22oz
dark
brown
color
looks
like
a
barleywine
aroma
is
sweet
candy
sugar
vanilla
barrel
booze
my
goodness
it
is
nice
flavor
is
more
of
the
same
very
delicious
boozy
sweet
great
barrel
characteristics
it
really
tastes
more
like
a
barleywine
than
a
quad
to
me
it
doesnt
seem
to
have
any
belgian
characteristics
at
all
this
is
quite
the
fine
beer
and
i
stupidly
passed
on
a
bottle
which
means
now
that
id
like
one
i
wont
find
one
oh
well
lucky
to
have
had
a
taste
at
all
this
compares
really
nicely
to
parabola
and
abacus
buy
it
if
you
see
it
o
i
had
high
expectations
for
this
beer
heard
great
things
about
it
but
it
lived
up
to
those
reputations
and
surpassed
them
imo
each
category
for
this
beer
has
something
thats
different
and
stands
out
from
other
categories
but
every
characteristic
of
this
beer
pieces
together
so
well
and
makes
it
complete
its
like
a
puzzle
sometimes
all
the
pieces
are
there
but
sometimes
you
cant
find
some
pieces
but
the
harder
you
look
you
end
up
finding
those
missing
pieces
this
beer
has
taken
my
palate
on
a
tour
around
the
world
instead
of
a
measly
roller
coaster
must
get
probably
my
new
favorite
offering
from
fw
well
done
guys
i
love
fws
double
jack
and
when
my
local
purveyor
recommended
this
i
had
to
go
for
it
its
expensive
but
if
you
want
something
special
and
unusual
i
think
this
is
worth
the
price
really
good
not
for
everyday
use
i
get
grape
plums
oak
and
zero
bitterness
so
many
flavors
in
a
bomber
compared
to
a
taster
on
tap
at
the
brewery
another
great
brew
from
firestone
and
one
of
my
new
favorite
barleywines
there
is
a
lot
going
on
here
huge
smell
huge
taste
and
huge
abv
lots
of
boozey
belly
warmth
from
this
smell
is
thick
with
brown
sugar
leather
cherry
chocolate
and
oak
taste
is
very
sweet
but
complex
with
vanilla
butter
dark
espresso
chocolate
and
of
course
bourbon
there
is
no
booze
in
the
flavor
at
all
and
you
would
never
believe
it
was
16
overall
a
tasty
treat
much
like
a
barleywine
and
close
in
spirit
to
sucaba
enjoyed
this
just
as
much
as
i
did
at
the
firestone
walker
invitational
last
year
another
great
addition
to
the
barrel
aged
portfolio
at
firestone
o
i
thought
this
was
solid
overall
there
was
a
little
too
much
heat
from
the
booze
for
me
even
at
12
the
beer
did
get
better
as
warmed
up
so
id
suggest
waiting
a
touch
before
consuming
given
the
opportunity
d
very
drinkable
very
sweet
and
bold
with
a
nice
bourbon
mix
with
the
sweet
rich
caramel
and
nutty
malts
d
this
is
quite
good
reminds
me
of
draft
abacus
a
little
and
definitely
one
of
my
favorite
fw
blend
beers
definitely
explains
why
i
like
fw14
so
much
although
im
puzzled
as
to
why
i
didnt
love
fw15
i
must
hate

the

on
this
one
this
beer
has
a
good
carbonation
level
with
a
crisp
and
smooth
mouthfeel
overall
this
is
a
very
good
barleywine
with
lots
of
complex
aromas
and
flavors
i
am
very
glad
i
was
able
to
try
this
one
o
excellent
beer
perhaps
a
bit
bolder
in
places
than
abacus
id
love
to
see
this
make
an
appearance
in
the
proprietors
reserve
series
so
others
and
myself
could
enjoy
this
heretofore
draftonly
delight
in
bottles
yum
o
i
took
a
good
30
minutes
or
so
smelling
and
sipping
on
this
one
i
thoroughly
enjoyed
this
more
so
than
abacus
personally
i
hope
they
bottle
this
one
too
at
some
point
as
it
has
more
of
that
bourbon
vanilla
i
like
and
less
of
the
dark
fruit
notes
justin
4
0nick
natalia
definitely
could
drink
more
than
the
6oz
pour
theyre
offering
here
d
this
was
a
weird
beer
in
fact
several
of
the
blending
components
for
fw14
arent
all
that
great
but
somehow
they
make
a
delicious
final
product
an
interesting
tack
to
take
with
such
a
big
brew
one
that
doesnt
usually
benefit
from
exposure
to
wood
but
its
been
done
before
and
will
be
done
again
here
the
results
are
rather
ineffectual
overall
so
its
not
really
worth
spilling
any
more
words
over
in
and
of
itself
this
is
an
easydrinking
generally
pleasant
quad
ale
none
too
complex
but
so
what
i
am
normally
a
fan
of
clown
shoes
but
this
one
did
not
do
it
for
me
at
this
point
i
would
say
quads
dont
need
bourbon
barrel
aging
not
sure
what
it
added
to
this
beer
too
sour
for
the
style
this
is
a
good
enjoyable
beer
which
i
find
to
be
true
to
the
style
i
read
some
of
the
reviews
where
people
are
venting
their
spleens
and
i
think
its
a
bit
much
it
is
true
that
the
bourbon
barrel
taste
is
virtually
non
existant
and
i
understand
people
get
hacked
about
that
because
it
usually
adds
about
2
to
the
price
when
declared
but
when
i
see
ratings
at
the
the
level
of
piss
in
a
bottle
its
way
overboard
this
is
a
good
not
great
or
unique
quad
overall
i
generally
believe
that
quads
dont
need
to
be
barreled
but
if
youre
going
to
do
it
this
is
a
textbook
example
of
how
restrained
barreling
that
adds
to
and
doesnt
overpower
a
solid
quad
if
a
bit
alcoholic
i
love
that
complex
profile
espexially
the
toasted
oak
and
yeast
spice
balancing
the
sweetness
high
d
2
46
im
sorry
but
this
beer
isnt
to
style
this
beer
isnt
good
its
14
dollars
a
bottle
which
is
a
joke
if
you
love
overly
sweet
and
non
complex
flavors
this
might
be
worth
a
try
for
all
else
run
the
aroma
conjures
the
taste
of
caramel
creamy
vanilla
cranberries
and
some
nice
raisin
a
good
balance
of
bourbon
tartness
brown
bread
and
earthiness
summarizes
the
flavor
appropriately
a
sweet
black
cherry
addition
is
very
enjoyable
the
finish
is
a
tad
herbal
and
sharp
with
perhaps
a
bit
of
a
clove
element
to
it
as
well
although
the
body
and
mouth
feel
are
moderately
light
the
warming
sensation
is
heavy
and
in
this
case
its
quite
welcome
i
dont
think
anyone
who
seeks
out
a
bba
quad
is
looking
for
an
easy
drinking
beer
overall
this
is
a
memorable
entry
in
the
style
a
note
to
future
drinkers
and
in
reference
to
other
reviewers
its
essential
to
enjoy
this
beer
chilled
slightly
above
room
temperature
if
you
try
to
have
it
right
out
of
the
fridge
the
flavors
do
not
come
through
properly
you
are
not
getting
the
correct
experience
out
of
it
overall
while
interesting
and
the
only
clown
shoes
beer
other
than
vampire
slayer
that
i
did
not
find
to
be
a
singlenote
assault
of
hops
like
marine
mechanized
infantry
pouring
out
of
an
apc
with
guns
blazing
i
dont
know
that
this
is
a
repeater
for
me
the
barrel
notes
were
anything
but
subtle
and
the
quad
flavors
were
100
ester
with
little
to
no
malt
evident
still
a
decent
beer
owow
this
one
is
not
as
advertised
very
little
ba
qualities
did
have
some
good
quad
flavors
this
is
not
one
of
cs
best
efforts
not
recommended
if
its
optional
why
do
i
have
to
review
it
overall
decent
and
enjoyable
but
not
what
i
was
looking
for
in
a
belgian
quad
this
beer
was
so
soured
what
a
disappointment
i
had
literally
purchased
it
a
week
prior
and
have
been
on
a
bourbon
barrel
aged
kick
recently
being
a
home
brewer
about
4
years
now
i
have
had
one
batch
i
produced
with
a
simile
outcome
that
i
paid
14
50
for
a
commercial
producers
soured
product
is
very
disappointing
unfortunately
turns
me
off
from
trying
their
regular
stuff
best
of
luck
to
these
guys
with
qc
in
the
future
tasted
of
lactobacillus
pediococcus
and
brett
there
is
something
off
about
this
beer
the
tartness
is
completely
out
of
place
both
for
the
style
the
clown
shoes
taste
profile
its
not
bad
enough
to
engage
my
delicate
gag
reflex
but
its
nothing
id
be
happy
to
pick
out
of
a
lineup
not
very
good
if
i
had
another
peace
i
would
age
it
and
hope
for
developing
complexity
not
going
to
get
another
good
to
try
once
no
review
to
give
now
not
one
of
clown
shoes
best
unfortunately
overall
the
aroma
of
this
is
inviting
but
the
richness
and
stickiness
accompanied
by
so
much
sweet
candy
like
flavors
just
doesnt
do
it
for
me
id
like
a
little
more

a

taste
i
had
to
drainpour
i
am
not
a
big
believer
in
bad
bottles
but
this
may
change
my
mind
i
am
just
not
sure
how
others
enjoy
this
otherwise
a
nice
quad
not
setting
any
records
but
enjoyable
would
consider
cellaring
but
im
not
sure
it
would
improve
really
quite
good
overall
very
enjoyable
and
complex
its
just
ok
i
bought
2
so
mayb
it
will
taste
better
n
2016
after
i
let
it
age
a
lil
bit
7swans
a
swimming
is
a
much
better
belgian
style
quadruple
ale
by
the
bruery
if
u
look
n
4
this
style
of
beer
this
beer
just
didnt
do
it
for
me
too
much
alcohol
taste
i
have
been
very
impressed
with
clown
shoes
barrel
aged
beers
but
i
would
never
have
known
if
this
one
didnt
say
so
on
the
bottle
certainly
drinkable
but
i
was
pretty
disappointed
with
it
a
bit
thin
with
just
hints
of
bba
character
a
bit
of
heat
and
actually
quite
boozy
a
good
quad
overall
but
falls
short
as
a
bba
one
i
expect
some
age
to
do
some
good
for
this
brew
ill
say
up
front
ive
grown
to
be
quite
a
fan
of
clown
shoes
they
make
some
really
good
beer
and
they
are
responsive
and
friendly
on
forums
here
but
this
offering
falls
a
little
short
in
the
taste
there
are
hints
of
brilliancecherry
toffee
stonefruits
molasses
tobacco
smooth
bourbonbut
it
is
all
a
bit
messy
and
harsh
dont
get
me
wrong
its
good
and
for
a
lot
of
breweries
it
would
be
the
best
in
their
portfolio
but
relative
to
the
high
bar
cs
have
set
for
themselves
it
leaves
a
little
to
be
desired
i
may
have
to
buy
another
bottle
because
if
another
18
months
smooth
this
out
at
all
it
would
be
a
giantkiller
has
a
fruity
plum
bourbon
spice
nose
pours
chestnut
with
a
slight
haze
under
an
offwhite
foam
cap
it
has
a
super
creamy
palate
with
bourbon
toffee
vanilla
and
spice
a
light
initial
sweetness
dries
on
the
finish
there
is
some
alcohol
heat
that
grows
on
its
way
to
your
stomach
the
carbonation
is
very
soft
and
airy
and
gives
the
beer
an
impression
of
less
body
than
it
actually
has
as
it
warms
the
bourbon
becomes
more
apparent
i
love
the
subtle
bourbon
barrel
notes
not
overpowering
just
right
the
quad
itself
is
a
little
thin
very
little
head
no
lacing
somewhat
watery
mouth
feel
a
little
too
sour
for
the
style
overall
i
think
the
beer
is
still
successful
but
its
all
in
the
taste
pricy
but
worth
it
if
subtle
bourbon
barrel
notes
in
a
quad
sound
like
your
thing
o
wonderful
beer
bourbon
aged
beers
and
quads
are
among
my
favorites
i
should
seek
out
this
combination
more
often
pours
brown
in
color
with
a
fluffy
off
white
head
that
retains
nicely
smell
has
a
doninant
belgian
yeast
aroma
over
toffee
malt
notes
bourbon
and
oak
barrel
are
almost
non
existent
in
the
nose
taste
has
a
nice
balance
between
a
fruity
prune
and
cherry
belgian
yeast
flavor
along
with
a
semi
sweet
toffee
malt
bourbon
and
oak
barrel
are
much
more
prevelent
in
the
taste
than
the
nose
with
finishing
notes
of
caramel
oak
and
vanilla
mouthfeel
is
medium
to
heavy
in
body
with
high
carbonation
and
a
dry
sticky
finish
i
salute
clown
shoes
for
their
five
year
milestone
and
enjoy
celebrating
it
with
the
peace
that
money
cant
buy
despite
the
fact
that
the
style
is
a
bit
out
of
their
typical
wheelhouse
this
is
a
solidly
brewed
quad
glad
to
have
collected
multiples
to
see
how
it
develops
f
smooth
drinking
and
very
nice
for
the
abv
decent
carbonation
really
missing
the
bourbon
barrel
taste
smell
or
something
really
good
quad
but
not
living
up
to
bring
advertised
as
a
bbq
this
beer
rocks
place
it
in
the
fringe
nice
and
cold
then
drink
as
the
beer
gets
warmer
the
flavor
will
slow
pick
up
to
a
very
strong
taste
amazing
quads
seem
to
vary
this
one
seemed
more
sour
then
mellowed
by
the
bba
ive
had
other
bba
aged
quads
track
8
from
lost
abbey
and
avery
5
monks
both
very
different
than
this
offering
and
better
still
love
you
clown
shoes
o
a
nice
ba
quad
that
goes
fairly
light
on
the
barrel
but
still
gets
some
of
the
qualities
quite
easy
to
drink
for
being
11
5
making
for
a
nice
sipper
yet
another
solid
anniversary
brew
from
cs
ive
had
several
of
clown
shoes
ba
offerings
now
while
this
one
seems
to
be
the
lightest
on
barrel
character
its
still
a
nice
quad
and
great
sipping
beer
o
was
hoping
to
get
more
of
the
barrel
qualities
but
didnt
even
the
sweetness
usually
expected
from
a
quad
was
lacking
potentials
there
but
some
tweaking
is
needed
o
surprisingly
authentic
belgian
quad
barrel
character
is
not
too
strong
just
adds
a
bit
of
caramel
sweetness
and
perhaps
a
little
heat
does
not
feel
nearly
as
heavy
as
it
actually
is
it
drinks
well
for
an
11
5
barrelaged
quad
in
fact
warms
the
belly
for
sure
though
so
theres
no
hiding
in
the
end
very
tasty
and
easy
drinking
well
done
clown
shoes
to
another
5
years
of
even
more
delicious
brews
way
too
sweet
and
where
was
the
bourbon
overall
the
look
and
feel
of
this
beer
make
it
one
of
the
best
its
a
flavorful
quad
but
isnt
too
sweet
im
glad
i
had
it

that

st

is
the

amongst

would
love
to
try
it
fresh
as
well
though
i

that
this

i

the
only
thing
that
holds
this

back
is
the
lingering
burnt

not
that
it

a

would
in

add

not
my

style
of
beer
in

its

my

this
one

this

she
ever
liked
a

levo
em

duas

ela
possui

although
i
was
fortunate
to
see
how
the
flavors
changed
the
other
thing
is
the
alcohol
i
had
about
23
of
a
bottle
and
i
really
feel
it
this
is
a
really
nice
beer
to
split

a
fantastic
quad
well
balanced
with
an
abundance
a
great
flavors
ill
definately
be
enjoying
this
again
in
the
future
o
just
a
perfectly
executed
quad
you
can
really
sense
the
skill
and
time
that
went
into
this
a
definite
musttry
for
any
beer
lover
o
this
is
the
secondbest
quad
ive
had
and
quads
are
my
favorite
style
rochefort
10
is
better
than
this
but
not
by
leaps
and
bounds
st
bernardus
makes
great
beers
they
are
dong
trappiste
beer
better
than
most
of
the
trappiste
brewerys
right
now
and
this
is
their
topoftheline
to
me
o
pretty
damn
tasty
and
the
best
quad
i
have
ever
had
full
of
dark
fruit
toffee
and
caramel
the
10
abv
is
virtually
nonexistent
a
must
try
o
a
great
beer
that
almost
compares
to
the
westvleteren
12
o
this
was
just
a
hair
behind
the
rochfort
it
was
really
a
toss
up
between
the
two
o
this
is
a
delicious
balanced
quad
and
i
cant
wait
to
have
some
more
o
it
might
be
one
of
the
more
drinkable
and
balanced
quads
ive
ever
had
course
ive
never
had
westy
12
but
hell
doesnt
westy
12
have
a
very
very
similar
recipe
to
this
ah
well
that
doesnt
matter
because
its
every
bit
as
mindblowing
as
i
hoped
a
superb
ale
while
not
my
very
favorite
quad
perse
it
is
more
widely
available
than
the
very
few
examples
i
might
prefer
a
tremendous
brew
a
pleasure
to
savor
and
enjoy
slowly
the
temptation
is
there
to
go
nuts
but
some
restraint
is
in
order
given
that
i
only
have
one
bottle
wow
the
flavors
mirror
the
aroma
making
this
one
a
nice
decadent
treat
fig
raisin
plum
molasses
syrup
and
just
a
touch
of
booze
on
the
finish
theres
a
lot
going
on
here
and
im
not
sure
this
bottle
was
big
enough
for
me
to
capture
all
of
the
nuances
i
guess
thats
what
the
750s
are
for
this
was
a
treat
and
one
i
would
gladly
have
again
o
this
is
one
of
the
best
beers
that
i
have
ever
had
and
surely
one
of
the
best
beers
on
the
face
of
the
earth
i
would
highly
recommend
this
to
just
about
anyone
from
a
novice
beer
drinker
like
myself
to
a
seasoned
veteran
bravo
st
bernardus
bravo
o
one
of
the
best
breweries
in
the
world
showcasing
one
of
if
not
their
best
beer
excellent
all
around
extremely
easy
drinking
certainly
will
continue
to
order
overall
this
is
good
stuff
but
the
balance
between
the
sweet
and
more
bitter
flavours
could
be
better
still
very
enjoyable
o
this
is
one
of
those
beers
that
i
appreciate
and
can
see
what
others
enjoy
but
i
dont
particularly
like
much
myself
this
is
a
high
quality
quad
but
it
a
little
bitter
and
too
spicy
compared
to
others
in
this
style
i
enjoy
overall
good
not
the
best
quad
ive
ever
had
definantly
not
bad
by
any
means
smell
is
great
but
the
taste
lacks
in
my
opinion
good
on
a
cold
night
like
this
though
o
delicious
the
look
and
palate
of
an
english
porter
but
with
a
spicier
and
more
complex
flavor
likely
due
to
the
belgian
yeast
the
great
availability
of
this
beer
in
my
area
means
i
will
keep
this
one
in
stock
in
the
pantry
overall
st
bernardus
abt
12
is
a
fantastic
quad
but
it
is
not
quite
as
good
as
i
remember
i
wonder
if
i
will
have
similar
feelings
about
westy
12
next
time
i
have
it
o
a
real
deal
quad
flavor
body
and
balance
so
well
rounded
o
goes
down
somewhat
easily
nice
taste
not
too
filling
was
a
rather
lovely
beer
on
a
steamy
va
summer
night
beer
was
medium
bodied
with
a
sweet
slightly
fruity
smell
it
had
a
nice
creamy
head
about
11
12
thick
and
for
the
of
alcohol
it
was
well
balanced
bought
some
in
the
bottle
and
noticed
that
it
taste
better
at
around
50
degrees
rather
at
40
i
must
say
though
that
it
is
one
of
the
best
beers
i
have
tasted
overall
very
good
beer
but
you
and
i
both
have
had
better
especially
factoring
in
price
i
would
drink
again
no
doubt
about
that
but
slightly
skeptical
about
another
purchase
try
it
yourself
and
you
give
it
a
shot
o
it
is
a
stunning
beer
the
best
ive
had
so
far
it
has
such
a
rich
and
bold
flavor
very
sweet
balanced
with
bubbly
and
refreshing
carbonation
along
with
the
higher
abv
its
a
wonderful
mixture
i
dont
know
how
they
do
it
all
i
can
say
is
i
know
its
expensive
but
just
live
outside
the
box
for
one
day
and
try
this
beer
its
outstanding
your
going
to
like
what
you
taste
i
guarantee
it
overall
i
hear
a
lot
of
people
like
this
better
than
westy
12
not
this
guy
from
this
bottle
but
i
will
have
to
try
them
side
by
side
at
some
point
a
great
beer
despite
my
criticism
a
truly
worldclass
beer
dark
brown
color
big
brown
creamy
head
plum
alcohol
yeast
and
berries
in
aroma
flavor
is
strong
cream
and
toffee
with
a
sting
of
alcohol
also
malts
and
yeast
make
their
way
through
lovely
product
with
a
nice
long
roasted
aftertaste
in
the
throat
as
well
as
creamy
toffee
in
the
mouth
o
had
passed
on
this
one
and
rochefort
10
because
they
are
always
there
great
quad
and
would
rate
it
a
close
second
to
rochefort
overall
this
beer
deserves
to
be
and
is
one
of
the
best
its
really
complex
and
unique
i
need
to
try
the
rest
of
the
st
bernardus
this
quad
is
a
fantastic
execution
and
has
defined
the
style
this
is
the
beer
american
brewerys
belgianstyle
quads
or
high
gravity
dubbels
aim
for
ive
sampled
most
of
the
labels
listed
including
those
not
available
here
in
the
us
e
g
westvlereten
12
and
abt
12
blows
most
of
them
out
of
the
water
the
rich
yeasty
flavors
that
linger
long
after
the
crisp
finish
imparts
one
hell
of
a
taste
experience
to
this
fullest
bodied
ale
the
pour
explodes
into
a
foamy
head
instantly
and
the
initial
effervescence
within
seconds
transforms
into
a
robust
fizz
that
carries
the
breadlike
base
into
at
least
10
different
flavors
you
can
actually
discern
intermediate
overtones
of
vine
fruits
assorted
spices
etc
i
wonder
how
many
of
your
raters
have
actually
tried
this
angelic
brew
cause
if
they
did
the
scoring
would
be
quite
a
bit
different
o
excellent
quad
i
could
sip
on
this
all
night
a
very
excellent
quad
to
be
sure
not
over
sweet
with
a
very
good
complexity
and
highly
interesting
and
pleasing
to
drink
should
be
sought
out
and
tried
silky
smooth
fairly
viscous
mouthfeel
this
is
everything
you
want
in
a
beer
had
it
recently
and
it
was
hands
down
one
of
the
best
beers
i
have
ever
had
o
a
very
nice
quad
very
flavorful
and
great
for
sipping
o
one
of
the
better
quads
out
there
nice
and
mellow
with
lots
of
fruit
and
malty
sweetness
but
no
where
near
overly
sweet
or
cloying
in
fact
its
on
the
drier
side
well
balanced
flavors
with
substantial
complexity
its
a
distant
runnerup
to
westy
12
but
then
again
who
can
really
compete
pours
a
medium
brown
with
decent
head
smell
is
of
very
ripe
fruits
of
the
apple
pear
variety
as
well
as
figs
plums
etc
taste
follws
with
an
extra
bump
of
brown
sugar
and
alcohol
its
really
sweet
which
i
think
limits
its
drinkability
but
the
flavor
is
good
and
the
alcohol
is
very
warming
so
it
calls
for
a
slow
sip
approach
anyhow
i
would
definitely
rank
this
among
the
best
abbey
ales
ive
had
really
good
even
if
they
are
not
among
my
favorite
styles
im
not
huge
on
belgian
beers
but
st
bernardus
knows
how
to
do
it
well
nice
depth
and
complexity
big
without
being
too
aggressive
warms
and
ages
like
a
champ
truly
a
top
example
of
the
style
ive
had
this
at
least
4
times
in
the
past
and
i
dont
quite
understand
why
i
never
gave
it
a
full
review
for
me
this
sets
the
bar
for
quads
its
very
tasty
and
its
easy
to
get
no
its
got
as
good
as
westy
12
but
its
really
one
of
the
best
o
i
am
a
big
fan
of
rochefort
10
but
this
is
an
equally
great
version
of
the
style
i
tried
this
beer
when
i
was
in
belgium
the
head
was
nice
and
foamy
the
smell
of
malt
was
rich
and
with
a
chocolate
mouth
feel
coated
my
mouth
and
lingered
for
a
moment
finished
superb
with
the
10
it
does
the
job
quite
quickly
all
in
all
one
damn
good
smooth
beer
served
in
a
branded
goblet
poured
a
deep
brown
in
colour
stained
foamy
head
leaving
no
lacing
smells
sweet
and
malty
with
a
hint
of
alcohol
too
thanks
to
the
10
tastes
light
on
the
tongue
filling
and
developing
in
the
back
of
the
mouth
malt
presence
becomes
really
prevalent
on
the
finish
classic
trappist
new
years
here
we
come
forget
the
champagne
get
this
smooth
from
beginning
to
end
trappist

to

wait

slip
it
slow
or
have
many
only
draw
back
is
10
to
some
that
was
not
a
negative
moving
to
belgium
overall
not
the
best
beer
ive
had
maybe
its
because
i
had
high
expectations
but
ive
had
3
the
last
few
months
and
ive
had
mixed
experiences
still
have
3
in
my
fridge
so
i
might
change
my
mind
330ml
into
an
orval

is
pretty
good
its
an
enjoyable
sipper
i
just
wish
it
had
more
depth
of
flavor
o
ive
had
bottles
of
this
which
i
enjoyed
much
more
but
this
one
just
isnt
wowing
me
nothing
particularly
bad
about
it
but
its
not
standing
out
for
me
at
the
moment
the
flat
aroma
seems
especially
disappointing
pours
dark
brown
with
some
purple
around
the
edges
fluffy
white
to
offwhite
head
two
fingers
of
it
smells
of
prunes
and
figs
some
light

a

explodes
with
fruit
pears
figs
prunes
plums
then
some
brown

along
with
spicy
yeast
this
is
an
easy
drinker
and
hides
the
alcohol
well
medium
mouthfeel
medium
to
high
carbonation
leaves
you
wanting
more
great
beer
overall
this
beer
is
amazing
so
close
to
perfection
if
it
isnt
perfect
already
i
pass
this
beer
up
all
the
time
but
when
i
do
pick
one
up
i
always
thoroughly
enjoy
it
cheers
its
a
really
great
quad
one
of
the
best
ive
had
truly
setting
the
bar
on
what
a
quad
should
be
o

just
amazing
i
was
hesitant
towards
grabbing
this
beer
i
dont
know
why
but
this
wonderful
concoction
of
smell
taste
look
and
feel
just
blew
me
away
i
would
recommend
this
to
many
if
you
see
it
buy
it
it
is
just
an
astounding
well
crafted
beer
that
can
not
disappoint
anyone
st
bernardus
is
easily
making
their
way
into
my
favorite
breweries
love
it
3
not
my
first
time
having
this
one
i
sipped
it
for
over
an
hour
tonight
and
enjoyed
every
second
solid
pour
from
growler
into
new
st
bernardus
chalice
beautiful
beer
deep
rich
brown
with
a
generous
2
finger
beige
head
smell
is
of
raisins
figs
bready
malts
and
burnt
wood
taste
follows
the
nose
closely
i
get
a
bit
more
of
the
fig
and
raisin
on
the
front
end
with
a
nice
hop
finish
very
smooth
brew
for
a
10
abv
quad
difficult
to
set
down
as
it
is
so
balanced
and
solid
feel
is
a
nice
thick
creamysilk
that
sits
well
on
the
tongue
with
just
enough
carbonation
overall
i
have
had
this
on
draft
and
from
the
growler
and
both
were
outstanding
more
fruit
as
it
warms
and
it
is
so
smooth
and
balanced
the
best
i
have
had
in
this
style
and
im
usually
not
a
fan
so
that
is
saying
something
a
must
try
from
the
awesomely
fun
label
to
the
dark
and
smooth
pour
this
is
a
high
quality
beer
it
has
a
relatively
high
alcohol
content
but
it
the
alcohol
doesnt
overwhelm
either
the
smell
or
taste
it
pours
easily
and
leaves
a
fair
head
and
lattice
relatively
dark
i
think
it
strikes
a
nice
balance
of
hops
malt
and
fruit
raisin
i
guess
coming
from
an
abbey
i
shouldnt
be
surprised
by
a
breadlike
yeasty
taste
too
overall
simply
said
i
cant
find
anything
to
criticize
about
this
beer
i
cannot
criticize
monks
that
give
their
life
to
god
and
in
the
process
make
mankind
very
happy
superb
tastes
smooth
for
the
abv
my
favorite
part
of
tasting
this
is
the
finish
a
nice
toasted
rich
nutty
aftertaste
o
it
was
my
favourite
beer
for
a
while
but
im
getting
bored
of
belgian
brunes
served
from
tap
into
a
chalice
poured
brown
with
a
very
light
tan
two
finger
head
that
subsided
to
one
finger
slowly
maintained
phenomenal
lacing
throughout
the
glass
the
aroma
was
comprised
of
sweet
malt
dark
fruit
fig
bread
fruit
and
sweet
alcohol
the
flavor
was
of
sweet
malt
dark
fruit
bread
sweet
alcohol
and
fruit
it
had
a
medium
feel
on
the
palate
with
mediumhigh
carbonation
overall
this
was
a
great
brew
i
saw
this
one
on
tap
and
had
to
jump
on
it
as
it
is
the
first
time
ive
seen
it
on
since
i
started
reviewing
i
was
definitely
not
disappointed
at
all
all
the
right
flavors
and
aromas
for
a
great
quad
were
definitely
present
and
made
themselves
known
right
out
of
the
gate
this
brew
does
this
while
still
remained
very
well
balanced
and
drinkable
really
glad
i
got
the
chance
to
have
this
one
again
and
will
be
doing
so
again
in
the
future
maybe
in
the
form
of
the
60th
anniversary
i
have
sitting
in
my
cellar
o
this
is
definitely
one
of
the
best
quads
out
there
belgium
knows
their
beers
was
in
brussels
just
a
while
back
and
stuck
mostly
to
drinking
trappist
ales
but
had
to
try
this
world
famous
abbey
ale
and
what
a
treat
just
a
stunning
beer
deep
brown
color
and
a
head
you
could
eat
with
a
spoon
lace
sticks
on
the
glass
to
the
last
sip
smell
is
sweet
and
malty
thats
dominant
spices
like
cinnamon
and
clove
are
in
there
tastes
christmasy
which
is
hard
to
describe
the
spices
from
the
smell
are
definitely
still
there
huge
sweetness
its
like
caramel
or
some
kind
of
malty
molasses
toasty
and
bread
with
just
the
slightest
bitterness
toward
the
end
also
i
have
to
mention
the
huge
alcohol
taste
its
not
the
first
thing
that
hits
you
thats
the
sweetness
of
the
malt
but
it
is
obvious
goes
down
smooth
with
subtle
carbonation
and
huge
creaminess
somehow
this
high
alcohol
beer
is
very
drinkable
id
have
another
this
is
not
overrated
get
some
definitely
one
of
the
best
if
not
the
best
beers
in
its
class
highly
recommended
overall
this
is
my
first
quadrupelbelgian
strong
dark
ale
and
i
am
completely
blown
away
as
soon
as
i
took
the
first
sip
i
knew
this
was
the
best
beer
i
have
ever
had
bsdaquads
may
well
be
my
new
favorite
style
verdict
this
is
definitely
one
of
the
best
beers
thats
as
available
as
it
is
not
sure
it
quite
ranks
up
there
with
rochefort
10
and
westy
12
but
its
damn
good
and
so
easy
to
get
overall
3rd
time
ive
had
this
and
it
will
be
the
last
recently
got
more
better
fruit
flavor
from
an
absolutely
delicious
super
fresh
sixer
of
troegenator
overall
this
is
a
great
beer
tastes
good
looks
great
smells
like
it
should
and
its
not
hard
to
drink
there
are
quite
a
few
quads
and
triples
made
in
na
but
none
compare
to
this
beast
of
a
beer
the
only
knock
i
have
on
it
is
the
price
there
are
some
beer
that
just
a
little
bit
weaker
than
this
that
are
nearly
half
the
price
maybe
even
cheaper
second
review
on
one
of
my
favorite
beers
looks
great
in
my
quad
glass
with
a
creamy
tan
head
and
a
deep
golden
brown
color
smell
is
dark
fruit
malty
and
bright
alcohol
deep
rich
flavor
of
dark
fruits
and
banana
nut
bread
but
never
approaches
being
too
sweet
boozy
but
nice
drinkability
clean
finish
with
the
perfect
beery
aftertaste
nice
and
warm
on
the
belly
near
perfect
o
an
outstanding
example
of
a
brew
that
is
often
taken
as
a
challenge
and
not
given
its
due
respect
but
this
is
the
real
deal
drink
this
beer
pours
a
very
dark
brown
large
head
on
pour
quickly
fades
though
beautiful
lacing
and
the
bubbles
are
very
fine
like
in
their
tripel
which
i
previously
reviewed
and
loved
scent
is
of
dark
fruit
like
plums
and
dates
belgian
yeast
and
malts
taste
is
fantastic
notes
of
dark
fruits
belgian
yeast
and
a
bit
of
soy
there
is
a
good
amount
of
booziness
though
but
not
too
much
to
detract
from
the
well
balanced
flavor
this
is
a
very
very
thick
full
beer
mouthfeel
is
thick
with
that
booziness
and
just
a
bit
of
very
fine
carbonation
overall
a
fantastic
brew
though
due
to
how
big
of
a
beer
this
is
its
definitely
one
to
take
slow
and
enjoy
for
those
that
want
something
a
little
crisper
and
less
heavy
their
tripel
fits
perfectly
and
i
must
say
i
enjoyed
the
two
about
the
same
overall
overall
rated
high
for
a
reason
it
has
a
wonderful
taste
aroma
and
feel
delicious
i
wonder
what
cheese
would
go
with
this
beer
hard
to
believe
westy
12
would
dominate
in
a
blind
taste
test
but
i
would
love
to
eat
my
words
anyone
want
to
shut
me
up
please
o
just
an
allaround
great
beer
go
drink
one
if
you
havent
poured
from
the
bottle
the
beer
was
a
cloudy
dark
brown
color
with
tan
head
in
my
case
the
bottle
became
a
little
overexcited
and
tried
leaving
the
bottle
the
moment
the
cork
popped
this
did
not
affect
my
drinking
experience
the
nose
was
familiar
to
most
belgians
a
malty
aroma
was
accompanied
by
hints
of
dark
fruit
the
initial
taste
was
alomst
mediciny
in
the
variation
on
the
dark
fruits
the
degree
of
carbonation
was
higher
the
i
would
have
anticipated
for
a
quad
the
carbonation
brushed
away
some
of
the
notes
i
was
seeking
rather
quickly
dark
fruits
burned
malts
and
a
hint
of
chocolate
were
obvious
in
the
aftertaste
the
beer
gave
a
pleasant
warming
sensation
this
is
an
easy
sipping
beer
however
it
was
not
quite
as
sweet
as
some
other
quads
i
have
had
do
a
tasty
treat
my
only
complaint
in
terms
of
drinkability
would
be
that
as
i
worked
through
the
glass
a
bit
of
a
black
licorice
taste
started
to
shine
through
i
like
black
licorice
but
i
just
thought
it
was
odd
and
didnt
quite
work
here
still
enjoyable
overall
though

excellent
body

feel
and
flavor
a
world
class
quadrupel
overal
i
recently
had
the
st
b
dubbel
and
i
think
i
prefer
the
dubbed
to
the
quad
dont
get
me
wrongthis
is
a
beer
to
savor
but
for
quads
i
might
be
inclined
to
reach
for
the
ommegang
3
ps
before
this
again
though
its
a
close
call
deep
plum
brown
with
a
nicely
retained
beige
head
in
a
st
bernardus
goblet
garnet
hues
barely
shine
through
in
the
light
nicely
sweet
predominantly
caramel
plum
raisins
and
a
light
toffee
hint
perhaps
even
a
touch
of
burnt
sugar
in
the
very
farthest
reaches
of
the
crevices
of
your
palate
this
beer
commands
respect
to
all
those
savoring
its
greatness
very
very
light
hint
of
hops
keeps
it
from
being
cloying
yet
remaining
undetectable
by
conventional
means
its
almost
as
if
the
hops
are
simple
leaving
a
shadow
to
dance
with
the
malts
and
fruity
flavors
carbonation
is
spot
on
sweet
and
almost
chewy
body
but
still
incredibly
smooth
overall
a
solid
belgian
quad
is
it
39
when
reviewed
best
beer
in
the
world
absolutely
not
otherwise
all
around
good
o
really
big
complex
tasty
belgian
quad
with
loads
of
flavor
its
heavy
and
intense
so
good
heavy
fullbodied
mouthfeel
with
medium
to
light
carbonation
drinkability
is
high
dangerous
so
in
the
final
analysis
id
put
this
a
step
below
rochefort
10
but
still
a
truly
great
beer
o
great
beer
amazing
complexity
totally
a
treat
a
wonderful
example
of
the
quad
as
a
style
and
a
new
favorite
the
complex
flavors
here
are
wonderful
and
this
is
something
i
could
sip
on
many
nights
overall
i
am
impressed
with
it
i
went
in
with
some
doubts
but
the
richness
and
complexity
is
great
everyone
needs
to
have
this
beer
at
least
once
i
had
34
the
glass
writing
this
i
now
have
a
warm
glow
and
a
huge
smile
i
love
this
stuff
o
archetype
of
the
style
big
on
flavor
but
still
pretty
drinkable
for
a
quad
taste
very
fruity
plum
takes
the
center
stage
a
little
over
carbonated
for
this
much
flavor
and
complexities
to
figure
everything
out
no
booze
taste
and
at
10
that
is
a
big
surprise
i
wouldnt
put
it
up
there
with
westy
12
but
still
a
very
good
quad
this
is
the
beer
that
started
it
all
for
me
two
years
ago
had
it
on
tap
at
brasserie
v
madison
and
opened
a
door
i
didnt
know
existed
id
always
thought
i
was
a
lager
guy
doppelbocks
were
as
serious
i
got
about
beer
at
the
time
that
and
blackandtans
the
abt
12
broke
it
all
wide
open
now
i
know
im
a
malt
guy
love
the
belgians
love
the
barley
wines
and
old
ales
love
the
imperial

can

about

of

abtquad
style
o
a
very
good
quad
overall
theres
a
lot
of
great
nuance
here
along
with
a
very
nice
body
that
avoids
being
too
thick
and
sweet
o
deep
complex
flavor
hard
to
believe
that
this
is
just
malt
hops
water
and
yeast
a
great
example
of
why
i
respect
beer
overall
a
superb
beer
very
easy
to
drink
and
100
enjoyable
if
you
are
not
into
sweet
beers
then
this
might
not
be
your
favorite
but
still
well
worth
the
try
one
of
the
best
of
a
superb
style
of
beer
worldclass
stuff
bought
a
bottle
of
this
at
tanakaya
in
mejiro
tokyo
poured
into
a
trappistes
rochefort
goblet
the
appearance
of
this
quad
is
wild
a
mediumthickness
white
head
that
as
it
dissipates
reveals
this
strange
chocolateswirl
that
makes
it
look
like
a
cappuccino
the
brew
itself
is
also
very
cloudy
looking
almost
alive
as
mist
glides
through
the
liquid
it
has
a
wonderful
apple
scent
that
comes
off
the
top
of
the
brew
in
a
noticeable
but
not
overpowering
way
the
taste
is
spoton
especially
as
the
brew
warms
up
in
temperature
really
making
that
10
abv
present
the
only
downside
to
this
brew
to
me
was
the
excess
gas
and
the
sometimes
harsh
aftertaste
that
accompanies
it
overall
i
love
this
beer
but
i
might
choose
other
trappist
brews
over
this
in
the
future
excellently
paired
with
a
garlicy
steak
o
just
an
overall
outstanding
quad
perfect
in
every
aspect
for
this
style
and
the
drink
ability
is
off
the
charts
for
a
big
beer
like
this
i
love
this
beer
o
a
fantastic
beer
with
everything
you
could
ever
ask
for
i
want
a
bottle
to
be
placed
in
my
casket
overall
this
beer
is
ridiculously
good
great
smell
unique
flavor
nice
mouthfeel
and
at
10
it
gets
you
lit
quickly
i
drank
it
cold
but
warm
i
think
it
would
be
just
as
good
try
it
today
o
i
truly
enjoyed
having
this
trappist
ale
as
much
as
the
monk
depicted
on
the
bottle
along
with
rochefort
10
and
westvleteren
12
though
i
havent
yet
had
it
this
brew
easily
fits
in
the
top
tier
of
quads
and
does
not
disappoint
at
all
with
its
superb
flavor
and
addictive
mouthfeel
sometimes
its
nice
to
just
relax
and
sip
on
a
complex
beer
to
take
the
taste
buds
for
an
awesome
ride
st
bernardus
abt
12
is
an
excellent
choice
for
such
an
occasion
this
beer
has
forced
me
to
reevaluate
the
need
to
attend
release
parties
or
fight
for
hardtoget
special
releases
why
bother
when
this
stuff
is
so
damn
good
and
so
easy
to
get
it
is
easily
one
of
the
most
complex
and
besttasting
beers
i
have
ever
had
i
deeply
regret
buying
two
big
bottles
of
it
i
should
have
bought
a
case
o
you
will
understand
why
the
folks
at
brouwerij
st
bernardus
consider
this
their
show
piece
d
easily
drinkable
nice
finish
and
a
long
aftertaste
taste
is
again
comprised
of
the
aforementioned
fruit
including
some
raisin
the
alcohol
warming
presence
is
muted
and
subtle
despite
the
high
10
abv
wow
this
is
a
delightful
and
nuanced
beer
that
transcends
the
norm
beautiful
overall
this
is
an
intensely
satisfying
and
tasty
beer
with
a
ton
of
unique
flavors
that
are
blended
together
extremely
well
this
is
most
definitely
a
brew
to
be
savored
again
and
again
celibacy
aside
being
a
trappist
monk
must
be
great
pray
to
god
all
day
drink
this
heavenly
nectar
all
night
o
a
great
example
of
a
quadbsda
o
tasty
as
always
and
truly
an
easily
obtainable
benchmark
of
style
pours
a
dark
caramelcolored
beige
with
a
beautiful
fluffy
offwhite
two
finger
head
gorgeous
lacing
the
smell
of
fruit
perhaps
plum
black
cherries
and
a
bit
of
fig
on
the
nose
sweet
malt
and
spice
as
well
initially
clove
and
pleasant
spice
dominate
giving
way
to
sweet
malt
dark
fruit
and
yeasty
esters
finishes
sweet
with
pleasant
alcoholic
warmth
perfect
smooth
creamy
mouthfeel
a
near
perfect
beer
and
one
of
the
best
brews
ive
had
the
privilege
of
drinking
notes
fresh
by
6282016
drank
on
222012
overall
a
very
good
beer
but
good
have
been
better
with
a
decent
rich
head
perhaps
my
12
ounce
bottle
was
old
or
my
glass
dirty
but
id
never
seen
such
large
glassthin
carbonation
bubbles
virtually
no
head
at
the
finish
and
no
lacing
or
rings
on
the
glass
otherwise
the
taste
elements
were
pretty
much
spoton
for
a
quad
a
little
tidbit
i
just
learned
st
bernardus
was
once
a
contract
brewer
for
westvleteren
and
the
abt
12
is
based
heavily
on
the
12
is
it
possible
that
if
westvleteren
wasnt
so
hard
to
get
it
might
rate
right
around
st
bernardus
food
for
thought
o
im
new
to
this
style
having
only
had
three
philosophers
before
this
looking
forward
to
delving
into
this
style
more
obviously
this
is
a
classic
o
hands
down
one
of
the
best
if
not
the
best
i
have
tried
world
class
o
complex
yet
simple
delicious
and
intense
yet
soft
and
enjoyable
is
this
one
of
the
top
quads
out
their
most
definately
can
i
have
another
please
a
very
decent
beer
one
of
the
best
good
for
a
celebration
or
occation
very
sophisticated
feeling
this
beer
has
has
not
changed
just
wonderful
5
o
probably
my
favorite
belgian
abbey
beer
so
far
will
be
back
poured
into
a
chalice
pours
dark
brown
with
a
finger
length
tan
head
that
slowly
dissipates
toffee
raisin
date
fig
and
some
alcohol
are
present
in
the
aroma
its
very
pleasing
the
flavors
of
bread
toffee
yeast
and
dark
fruits
explode
in
the
mouth
on
the
first
sip
the
alcohol
taste
is
there
but
its
not
overpowering
however
the
alcohol
taste
becomes
more
apparent
the
warmer
it
gets
the
mouthfeel
is
full
and
the
carbonation
is
abundant
overall
this
is
a
most
excellent
example
of
a
quad
that
is
relatively
easy
to
find
i
recommend
this
one
o
one
of
the
finest
quads
in
existence
easy
to
drink
but
thats
not
really
the
point
with
a
beer
like
this
love
it
poured
to
duvel
tulip
the
beer
arrives
a
rich
deep
dark
brown
color
with
a
nice
3
finger
white
billowing
head
with
supreme
retention
and
lacing
looks
phenomenal
as
poured
the
aroma
fills
the
room
with
a
nice
variety
of
dark
fruits
roasted
malts
molasses
and
bread
no
hint
of
higher
abv
the
flavor
builds
on
the
pleasant
nose
and
is
a
delight
very
thick
and
creamy
and
rich
from
the
get
go
but
incredibly
approachable
the
sweetness
of
the
malt
is
most
prominent
at
first
but
mellows
quickly
as
a
light
bitterness
enters
the
dark
fruit
gives
way
to
hints
of
raisins
molasses
figs
and
liquorice
and
is
very
nice
finishes
creamy
and
smooth
with
a
lingering
sweetness
full
bodied
and
well
carbonated
overall
this
is
a
treat
i
cant
wait
to
purchase
more
to
age
and
enjoy
later
highly
recommended
definitely
going
on
my
rotation
but
its
a
little
pricey
you
get
what
you
pay
for
though
overall
this
was
the
beer
that
introduced
me
to
quadrupels
i
think
i
have
it
ranked
ever
so
slightly
behind
the
rochefort
trappistes
10
and
comfortably
behind
the
westvleteren
12
but
thats
because
those
beers
are
phenomenal
the
trappist
quads
set
a
ridiculous
standard
and
abt
12
is
a
brilliant
beer
o
this
beer
is
warm
and
inviting
after
dinner
dessert
drink
although
it
would
pair
well
with
a
hearty
meal
such
as
a
meat
stew
i
think
this
would
be
best
with
bread
cheese
nuts
and
dark
dried
fruits
it
is
sweet
malty
and
complex
o
an
amazing
quadrupel
maybe
would
have
been
even
better
from
a
bottle
but
very
enjoyable
and
smooth
o
this
is
probably
my
favorite
belgian
that
i
can
readily
get
off
the
shelf
not
much
else
to
add
other
than
that
cheers
o
just
an
excellent
beer
in
every
aspect
loved
it
o
fantastic
just
great
really
good
flavours
great
complexity
i
really
like
this
beer
oan
excellent
brew
lots
of
complexity
but
smooth
and
enjoyable
looking
forward
to
trying
this
again
o
this
was
a
great
quad
while
the
smell
and
taste
didnt
blow
me
away
the
mouthfeel
is
what
made
this
beer
fantastic
the
beer
was
incredibly
smooth
and
drinkable
definitely
one
of
the
better
belgian
beers
that
ive
had
the
beer
was
very
well
balanced
between
the
bready
yeastiness
and
slightly
lemonyfloral
sweetness
slightly
overhyped
but
still
very
good
this
is
my
go
to
beer
that
i
have
been
drinking
for
years
maybe
not
the
most
unique
or
creative
beer
but
a
quality
that
is
consistent
and
ever
satisfying
what
more
can
you
want
o
a
wonderful
beer
with
a
very
nice
complexity
of
flavor
and
balance
i
shouldnt
be
surprised
as
i
have
been
impressed
with
every
beer
i
have
had
from
st
bernardus
another
one
of
those
beers
that
i
continue
to
drink
and
appreciate
over
many
years
the
alcohol
is
well
hidden
considering
the
abv
but
this
is
a
sipping
beer
for
some
reason
people
like
to
say
this
is
better
than
westvleteren
12
and
i
dont
understand
that
at
all
still
a
fabulous
bier
appears
a
deep
dark
brown
with
a
nice
finger
of
offwhite
head
smells
of
caramel
and
malt
with
slight
hints
of
fig
and
nuts
tastes
just
like
it
smells
with
a
smooth
malty
finish
that
leaves
a
nice
coating
on
your
mouth
despite
the
high
alcohol
content
the
bite
is
masked
by
the
richness
of
this
quad
a
great
beer
overall
its
pretty
expensive
here
in
the
states
so
im
not
sure
if
ill
pay
to
drink
this
again
but
i
certainly
wouldnt
oblige
if
one
were
offered
to
me
poured
ontap
and
served
in
a
chalice
the
beer
is
an
opaque
rich
bloodbrown
coloring
with
a
slight
filmy
sparsely
coating
the
surface
aromas
are
rich
and
complex
with
notes
of
licorice
molasses
and
slight
pepper
and
spicing
the
flavors
are
rich
and
deep
with
a
blend
of
plum
date
and
raisin
on
a
crisp
well
carbonated
body
the
alcohol
gives
a
nod
here
and
there
highlighting
the
palate
biscuit
and
bready
flavors
throughout
balance
the
other
characteristics
and
the
overall
malt
profile
is
complex
and
delicious
at
any
given
time
you
can
get
notes
of
caramel
toffee
molasses
old
world
fruits
and
even
some
buttery
tones
the
aftertaste
is
creamy
sweet
and
rich
almost
like
cake
batter
the
finish
remarkably
is
kept
light
by
the
carbonation
and
leaves
the
palate
fairly
clean
great
beer
overall
really
solid
quad
i
did
not
think
that
abt
12
would
stand
up
to
the
likes
of
westy
12
and
rochefort
10
but
it
does
this
beer
is
really
close
to
both
beers
but
its
just
a
little
rough
around
the
edges
compared
to
the
the
other
two
beers
very
minor
differences
i
gotta
say
in
other
words
abt
12
is
an
easy
to
get
westy
12
without
all
the
hyperarity
surrounding
it
just
like
rochefort
10
but
i
like
rochefort
10
just
a
little
bit
better
if
you
like
quads
dont
pass
this
beer
up
o
nice
rich
malty
sweet
beer
very
enjoyable
o
overall
this
is
an
excellent
beer
great
palate
profile
and
surprising
drinkability
i
do
think
rochefort
10
is
better
but
this
is
great
in
its
own
right
plus
its
widespread
availability
and
reasonable
price
make
it
a
worthy
regular
in
my
beer
rotation
and
definitely
a
must
try
for
those
who
have
not
yet
had
the
pleasure
of
drinking
it
o
takes
some
time
to
get
into
but
once
the
glass
starts
to
empty
the
complexity
and
deliciousness
is
fully
realized
aroma
is
not
pronounced
soft
and
benign
hints
of
sweet
dark
fruit
and
fails
to
prepare
you
for
your
first
taste
complexity
initially
hard
to
pin
down
whats
going
on
its
sweet
soft
and
warm
the
alcohol
is
here
but
melded
with
deep
malts
and
a
tumble
of
fruit
on
the
tongue
figs
cherry
lexia
raisin
come
licorice
and
spice
perhaps
its
is
leavened
out
with
bitter
chocolate
and
coffee
finished
with
lacing
of
fruit
salad
sweets
theres
other
elements
i
cant
describe
but
it
is
certainly
an
experience
and
highly
recommended
bottom
line
if
your
a
beer
snob
this
is
a
must
have
when
drinking
it
should
be
a
little
warm
and
is
a
heavy
syrupy
mouthfeel
that
is
pretty
well
carbonated
for
a
quad
the
taste
is
a
strong
sweetness
almost
cherrycoke
like
with
a
winey
port
sort
of
after
taste
as
it
warms
up
it
really
mellows
out
into
a
sweet
beer
with
a
malty
after
taste
and
is
an
adventure
in
and
of
itself
a
well
carbonated
beer
that
has
a
world
class
taste
pretty
much
what
you
smell
is
what
you
get
a
lot
of
dark
rich
flavors
including
cherries
raisins
bready
caramel
notes
and
that
great
unique
belgian
yeast
flavor
all
blending
together
to
make
an
absolutely
incredible
beer
out
of
a
bottle
purchased
at
the
hop
heads
bar
this
beer
was
a
cloudy
dark
chestnut
color
with
a
towering
head
of
foam
the
retention
was
impressive
and
the
lacing
in
fine
bands
with
fishnets
in
between
the
aroma
was
complex
and
appealing
i
detected
bready
malt
caramel
malt
belgian
yeast
dark
fruits
some
bananas
and
spices
the
flavors
were
equally
complex
and
yet
complimentary
all
the
same
notes
from
the
nose
were
apparent
in
the
taste
with
a
perfect
core
of
caramel
and
chocolate
malt
spicy
and
punchy
without
being
hot
i
thought
it
was
an
excellent
example
of
balance
and
finesse
dried
fruits
and
plums
became
more
pronounced
as
it
warmed
up
and
the
hops
presence
was
just
enough
to
counterbalance
the
malts
the
mouthfeel
was
creamy
the
body
mediumfull
and
the
carbonation
perfect
an
excellent
beer
in
every
way
and
one
of
the
finest
belgians
ive
had
o
when
the
quad
style
is
mentioned
this
is
a
prime
example
of
what
it
should
be
the
balance
of
this
beer
is
world
class
so
many
things
going
on
yet
seemingly
so
simple
this
one
will
one
will
always
have
a
special
place
in
my
heart
and
my
refrigerator
overall
the
best
belgium
strongquad
i
have
had
up
until
this
point
i
will
defiantly
be
gravitating
back
to
this
again
and
again
o
really
nice
smooth
and
full
bready
and
malty
deep
and
satisfying
a
terrific
beer
and
i
really
get
why
this
is
so
highly
rated
so
many
different
flavors
going
on
that
from
sip
to
swallow
the
profile
changes
constantly
the
body
and
mouthfeel
are
superb
and
at
no
time
does
the
beer
feel
heavy
nor
does
the
10
abv
overrule
the
experience
i
would
buy
this
again
in
a
heartbeat
i
think
this
is
also
best
shared
so
that
you
can
discuss
all
of
the
different
flavor
nuances
with
the
persons
youre
enjoying
this
with
it
pours
a
nice
dark
brown
color
with
a
huge
3
finger
width
with
a
offwhite
head
then
it
leaves
a
nice
ring
of
lacing
i
get
dark
sweet
fruits
like
raisins
and
figs
then
that
great
yeasty
smell
that
comes
with
all
quads
followed
up
with
a
slight
presences
of
alcohol
the
taste
is
great
that
raisinfig
taste
with
a
some
addition
sweetness
from
caramel
flavor
then
that
discernible
belgium
yeast
flavor
when
compared
to
other
quads
this
one
does
have
a
noticeable
alcohol
bite
that
the
others
do
not
have
the
mouthfeel
is
medium
but
it
is
too
carbonated
for
my
taste
overall
this
is
a
good
beer
but
when
compared
to
other
quads
it
places
in
the
top
5
but
near
the
bottom
o
im
not
a
big
fan
of
belgians
overall
and
hadnt
really
had
a
quad
i
could
say
i
liked
this
stuff
has
completely
shaken
my
perspective
in
a
very
good
way
im
surprised
this
stuff
was
sitting
on
an
obscure
shelf
in
my
local
liquor
store
o
fantastic
for
me
this
is
the
right
balance
of
bready
malt
and
fruit
sweetness
its
a
monster
to
drink
though
and
the
abv
is
noticeable
but
it
was
hard
to
stop
temp
51f
this
beer
is
awesome
fresh
or
with
a
year
on
it
i
dont
believe
this
is
the
perfect
or
best
beer
in
the
world
or
that
there
is
such
one
but
it
embodies
the
quad
style
perfectly
its
very
easy
to
drink
complex
and
balance
and
i
dont
think
there
is
anything
that
could
improve
this
o
one
of
the
best
in
the
world
no
doubt
pours
a
mahogany
brown
with
a
nice
tight
tan
head
scent
is
of
dark
fruit
and
cherries
with
a
roasted
maltiness
the
taste
follows
the
scent
and
fills
the
mouth
with
the
dark
cherry
cola
and
hint
of
spice
the
carbonation
is
excellent
this
is
an
excellent
quad
and
my
second
favorite
behind
rochefort
10
o
truly
excellent
paired
with
mussels
and
frites
delicious
and
complex
who
is
gonna
argue
with
this
brew
its
a
standard
bearer
of
one
of
the
worlds
most
renowned
beer
styles
excellent
one
of
my
favorite
quads
so
far
this
is
one
of
the
few
beers
that
i
have
had
more
on
tap
in
fact
this
is
the
first
time
i
had
it
out
of
the
bottle
i
will
have
to
say
it
is
a
bit
better
on
tap
from
what
i
remember
note
tasting
was
paired
wonderfully
with
8
slices
of
thick
cut
smoked
bacon
very
smooth
and
harmonious
probably
the
most
balanced
quad
i
have
drank
thus
far
only
wish
i
had
several
of
these
to
put
back
find
it
and
enjoy
o
a
really
enjoyable
beer
certainly
one
of
the
premier
quad
offerings
out
there
note
this
beer
is
far
too
good
to
be
alone
i
paired
this
with
a
roasted
garlic
hummus
pretzels
and
gouda
cheese
i
could
theoretically
see
you
pairing
this
with
a
braised
brisket
of
beef
a
quintessential
quadruple
its
no
rochefort
10
or
westy
12
but
it
holds
its
own
just
the
same
they
should
start
selling
this
beer
in
vending
machines
in
belgium
really
liked
this
quad
havent
had
too
many
makes
me
want
to
pick
up
a
few
others
o
fantastically
balanced
ale
that
boasts
bold
rich
flavors
without
the
characteristic
heaviness
of
a
stout
and
even
treads
bitter
waters
without
leaving
even
a
hint
of
a
boozy
aftertaste
very
impressive
indeed
stockpile
a
great
beer
that
is
a
wonderful
sipper
i
was
right
to
enjoy
this
on
a
cold
january
night
o
i
admit
to
not
being
a
fan
of
belgian
styles
particularly
quads
but
i
really
enjoyed
this
huge
aroma
and
flavor
profile
complexity
without
being
overly
sweet
very
nice
overall
this
is
an
excellent
beer
ill
enjoy
the
bottle
throughout
the
night
overall
awesome
everything
i
look
for
in
a
quad
enjoyed
over
the
course
of
40
min
as
it
warmed
fruity
tartish
notes
became
more
pronounced
and
the
head
completely
dissipated
overall
very
good
balance
quality
harmony
theres
an
unassuming
humility
though
too
its
not
trying
to
be
huge
just
to
be
very
well
done
there
are
richer
and
more
more
concentrated
beers
out
there
flavorwise
but
i
wouldnt
change
a
thing
what
a
light
and
delightful
treat
when
you
want
something
different
best
of
the
st
bernardus
lineup
and
an
incredible
example
of
the
style
the
rochefort
10
edges
it
out
in
my
book
but
that
doesnt
stop
it
from
being
world
class
o
this
was
my
second
favorite
beer
of
the
blind
tasting
and
a
solid
beer
allaround
the
balance
of
spice
and
dark
fruit
is
exceptional
while
the
abv
is
pronounced
but
not
overbearing
good
job
st
bernardus
nv
o
awesome
beer
really
phenomenal
i
think
i
still
actually
like
chimay
blue
a
tad
bit
more
or
maybe
not
it
is
really
close
anyway
this
is
an
awesome
beer
definitely
world
class
great
all
around
this
is
an
excellent
beer
and
the
craft
put
into
brewing
this
beer
is
world
class
i
just
find
the
aromas
and
flavors
to
be
really
good
but
not
mind
blowing
i
really
prefer
three
philosophers
blasphemy
o
i
like
this
beer
dont
get
me
wrong
but
ill
take
a
rochefort
10
any
day
sure
the
aroma
on
this
one
is
better
but
the
rochefort
packs
more
of
a
punch
in
terms
of
flavor
the
body
feels
maybe
a
little
too
weak
on
this
one
which
is
kind
of
funny
since
the
rochefort
is
a
bit
too
heavy
for
me
maybe
thats
what
makes
westvleteren
is
so
good
still
worth
seeking
out
though
d
id
have
it
again
though
ive
had
better
quads
it
hides
its
abv
well
but
i
think
its
a
bit
reserved
impressive
rich
and
tasty
a
smooth
and
complex
quad
that
deserves
the
acclaim
heaped
upon
it
swirling
it
around
the
mouth
is
a
pleasure
not
one
id
want
to
imbibe
every
day
but
a
must
try
for
any
beer
lover
overall
this
is
one
of
the
best
nothing
else
really
needs
to
be
said
split
a
750ml
with
a
friend
and
enjoy
the
best
life
has
to
offer
o
great
quad
i
havent
had
a
ton
of
belgians
but
i
can
tell
this
is
a
great
beer
o
not
my
style
but
it
is
still
ok
it
is
so
much
better
in
the
bottle
that
i
fully
intend
on
deleting
my
previous
review
as
having
it
on
tap
does
not
do
it
justice
this
is
as
close
to
a
westvleteren
12
as
you
can
get
i
will
definitely
be
drinking
this
much
more
in
the
future
there
is
a
reason
these
breweries
have
existed
for
hundreds
of
years
and
with
a
bottle
of
this
you
can
definitely
see
why
overall
what
the
enjoyed
most
about
this
brew
was
the
taste
the
fruity
and
estery
inclusion
helped
maintain
a
lightness
of
flavoring
this
also
helped
calm
the
huge
malt
framework
of
the
beer
the
complexity
was
there
and
everything
was
expertly
blended
together
working
in
harmony
the
aroma
and
feel
also
delivered
as
expected
in
a
very
belgian
way
this
beer
is
damn
near
perfect
for
a
cold
winter
day
enjoyed
this
on
tap
at
a
beer
bar
in
west
palm
beach
served
in
a
tulip
glass
the
dark
nectar
had
a
beautiful
tan
head
definitely
fruity
but
somehow
butterscotch
and
vanilla
notes
arrived
about
midglass
has
very
smoooth
and
long
finish
huge
sheets
of
belgian
lace
clung
to
the
glass
not
sure
how
it
would
go
with
food
but
id
drink
several
as
a
substitute
for
dessert
for
a
10
belgian
quad
this
beer
is
very
thin
highly
attenuated
no
heft
on
the
tongue
the
bordering
on
ridiculous
level
of
carbonation
really
damages
this
beer
it
mutes
the
aroma
and
destroys
the
mouthfeel
not
in
the
same
class
as
westy
12
or
rochefort
10
cheers
on
tap
at
clevelands
bier
markt
served
in
a
12
oz
tulip
with
a
small
head
appears
to
be
a
dark
amber
color
sorry
dim
lighting
in
the
bar
makes
it
difficult
to
determine
has
minimal
head
retention
and
no
lacing
smells
mostly
of
yeast
but
has
some
hints
of
nutty
malts
the
taste
is
medium
bodied
with
the
same
nuttiness
and
yeastiness
as
the
smell
it
is
well
carbonated
and
not
syrupy
at
all
it
tastes
different
on
draft
than
in
the
bottle
but
of
course
still
very
enjoyable
and
drinkable
o
fantastic
quad
the
alcohol
was
masked
very
well
through
all
the
fruit
flavors
that
came
out
one
of
these
beers
that
you
could
certainly
drink
multiples
of
however
with
being
10
itd
get
you
into
some
trouble
i
have
seen
this
beer
around
and
never
pulled
the
trigger
thank
you
for
this
and
it
is
going
to
become
a
part
of
my
regular
rotation
i
have
had
a
westy
12
in
the
past
and
as
previously
stated
this
style
is
not
one
i
have
a
lot
of
experience
with
however
i
would
take
this
over
the
westy
i
had
any
day
thanks
kevin
m
if
this
doesnt
get
a
perfect
mouth
feel
i
dont
know
what
can
clean
refreshing
and
no
noticeable
abv
i
would
be
so
happy
in
belgium
pounding
these
for
around
domestic
price
o
fantastic
available
and
doesnt
cost
an
arm
and
a
leg
happy
brewing
o
this
really
is
on
par
with
westvleteren
12
and
seemingly
much
more
consistent
and
cheaper
if
you
ever
find
yourself
tempted
to
fork
out
wads
for
a
westy
off
ebay
remember
these
words
dont
do
it
you
pooter
buy
an
abt
12
o
just
brilliant
i
have
a
westy
12
in
the
pantry
that
has
a
tough
act
to
follow
i
wont
get
into
an
entire
formal
review
but
i
was
incredibly
surprised
to
find
this
on
tap
at
the
new
yardhouse
in
va
beach
served
in
a
goblet
glass
the
beer
lived
up
to
its
reputation
in
every
regard
i
sampled
it
along
with
some
of
my
other
perennial
favorites
including
maredsous
10
aventinus
delirium
and
chimay
tripel
the
bernardus
12
stood
out
as
the
the
most
complex
well
balanced
full
bodied
beer
of
them
all
if
youre
a
connoisseur
you
need
to
put
plenty
of
this
in
your
fridge
right
next
to
the
chimay
grand
reserve
and
la
fin
du
monde
o
fantastic
complex
brew
with
great
marrying
of
flavors
top
tier
in
my
opinion
highly
recommend
o
very
tasty
but
the
best
part
is
the
feel
this
couldnt
be
more
perfectly
tailored
to
the
type
of
beer
that
it
is
it
is
intensely
easy
to
drink
while
also
complex
and
fulfilling
i
could
drink
this
all
day
time
to
become
a
monk
overall
a
fantastic
beer
i
am
glad
i
finally
stopped
to
have
one
and
look
forward
to
looking
back
on
these
thoughts
in
the
future
as
i
finish
this
4pack
over
the
next
few
years
nice
mouthfeel
lightly
creamy
medium
bodied
good
lively
carbonation
long
lingering
finish
that
reinforces
the
earlier
wine
aspect
of
this
beer
truly
excellent
a
bit
lighter
in
body
and
overall
feel
and
flavor
than
many
other
quads
elegant
and
well
constructed
i
actually
prefer
rocheforts
10
somewhat
but
hard
to
go
wrong
here
as
well
doa
overall
this
is
a
beer
well
worth
having
try
it
as
soon
as
possible
you
will
not
regret
it
o
this
is
just
an
all
around
great
beer
there
arent
tons
of
beers
like
this
around
me
and
i
am
glad
that
i
got
to
try
it
i
still
prefer
westy
12
but
this
is
very
close
in
quality
and
taste
well
done
o
a
very
nice
quad
i
see
why
its
rated
so
high
the
sourness
of
this
one
establishes
it
from
others
i
believe
its
certainly
not
bad
just
different
cheers
o
i
enjoyed
st
bernardus
abt
12
and
its
a
great
example
of
the
quad
style
i
dont
think
it
quite
lives
up
to
the
hype
but
its
enjoyable
and
relatively
decently
pricedwidely
available
so
i
imagine
itll
be
a
beer
that
i
revisit
multiple
times
in
the
future
a
nice
beer
to
sit
back
and
enjoy
if
you
have
a
chance
pick
up
st
bernarduss
sampler
that
comes
with
a
sniffer
glass
well
worth
the
money
o
just
ok
tastes
a
lot
like
the
8
just
a
little
thicker
simply
excellent
brew
very
smooth
and
extremely
easily
drinkable
everything
is
so
nicely
balanced
m
pretty
high
attenuation
for
the
gravity
makes
this
pretty
crisp
carbonation
is
low
this
drink
more
easily
than
it
has
right
to
quite
the
drinker
notes
wonderful
this
is
beguiling
intoxicating
beer
overall
st
bernardus
abt
12
is
a
very
very
good
beer
and
one
which
deserves
to
be
mentioned
among
the
very
best
belgian
quadrupels
it
is
slightly
atypical
for
the
style
but
when
a
beer
is
this
good
it
tends
not
to
matter
rjt
incredible
taste
first
beer
in
a
long
time
to
blow
me
away
like
it
did
classic
belgian
with
more
of
a
wheaty
smell
others
have
told
me
theyve
picked
up
a
berry
scent
and
it
came
up
theres
definitely
a
reason
this
beer
is
so
highly
regarded
i
cant
really
comment
on
anything
about
this
beer
that
hasnt
already
been
said
here
the
overwhelming
response
should
be
enough
overall
phenomenal
as
a
quad
it
arguably
does
not
get
any
better
than
this
with
so
many
taste
notes
and
so
many
hidden
subtleties
it
is
hard
not
to
think
so
highly
of
this
monastic
beer
remarkably
balanced
with
both
sweet
and
dry
flavors
it
is
virtually
perfect
in
every
way
possible
i
have
enjoyed
this
beer
countless
times
in
the
past
and
it
always
manages
to
leave
me
breathless
one
of
my
alltime
favorite
brews
handsdown
ive
had
this
in
bottle
and
on
tap
and
both
ways
it
was
very
good
a
smooth
taste
that
doesnt
lean
to
far
towards
bitter
or
sweet
and
keeps
the
malt
and
hops
tastes
in
balance
i
would
have
rated
the
small
at
5
0
also
but
i
couldnt
make
myself
rate
this
a
perfect
beer
even
though
its
pretty
damn
close
to
that
great
quad
will
have
to
revisit
some
of
the
other
big
names
to
see
how
it
compares
great
balance
and
complexity
as
of
now
if
i
wanted
to
show
someone
what
a
quad
should
be
like
it
would
be
this
one
great
beer
for
my
400th
review
o
this
beer
is
excellent
if
you
have
never
had
it
go
get
it
this
beer
pours
a
dark
brown
with
a
huge
head
that
left
good
lacing
as
it
dissipated
the
beer
was
allowed
to
warm
to
about
54
degrees
f
the
aroma
is
candy
sweet
with
a
mild
soapiness
there
are
light
hints
of
dried
fruits
and
a
faint
smell
of
booze
the
flavor
of
the
beer
is
sweet
and
spice
through
and
through
raisins
molasses
caramel
figs
and
spice
are
all
there
intertwined
beautifully
there
is
just
a
hint
of
bitter
and
the
aftertaste
is
a
lingering
spice
and
warmth
that
seems
great
for
cold
weather
the
mf
is
smooth
slick
and
slightly
watery
the
carbonation
seems
to
be
a
tad
high
and
the
alcohol
leaves
warmth
in
both
mouth
and
throat
this
is
a
damn
near
flawless
beer
in
my
opinion
this
is
a
perfect
blend
of
flavor
and
alcohol
the
flavors
are
rich
and
decadent
and
all
wonderfully
in
check
this
is
one
of
my
favorites
and
i
always
enjoy
it
final
thoughts
i
think
im
getting
tired
of
belgian
beers
and
they
dont
see
to
quite
be
for
me
each
time
i
have
them
they
come
across
as
high
class
but
snooty
and
disconnected
i
mean
the
higher
end
ones
seem
to
get
it
done
right
but
most
of
the
others
come
across
as
close
but
no
cigar
and
frankly
almost
like
they
are
trying
to
cheaply
imitate
other
beers
i
know
thats
not
the
case
but
thats
just
how
i
feel
about
them
anyways
this
is
one
fares
better
then
most
so
id
say
give
it
a
shot
d
still
a
solid
quad
but
at
10
abv
this
beer
just
doesnt
offer
enough
in
the
flavor
department
despite
all
these
complaints
this
beer
was
still
very
good
and
in
fact
really
easy
to
drink
this
one
is
certainly
going
down
as
something
to
rereview
down
the
road
o
this
is
a
damn
good
quad
i
enjoyed
it
much
more
than
rochefort
10
and
i
think
the
taste
aroma
mouth
feel
follow
close
behind
the
infamous
westy
12
o
great
beer
glad
i
bought
a
bunch
of
this
very
drinkable
looking
forward
to
cellaring
it
for
a
while
and
tasting
the
difference
o
awesome
beer
drinkable
big
fruits
and
sweet
malts
smooth
alcohol
hides
how
big
this
is
an
outstanding
quad
but
not
perfect
poured
into
a
goblet
a
nice
redish
amber
color
with
one
of
these
perfect
heads
only
a
belgian
can
provide
smells
sugary
yeasty
fruity
and
like
something
sticky
honey
caramel
molasses
flavor
is
fruity
and
malt
driven
up
front
with
some
slight
tart
sensations
happening
in
the
background
a
roasted
sweet
finish
rounds
this
one
off
unmatched
in
its
complexity
this
quad
goes
well
with
a
wide
array
of
food
i
had
it
with
a
rabbit
stew
mouthfeel
is
bright
and
bubbly
with
a
medium
body
the
10
abv
is
well
hidden
could
drink
this
all
night
but
it
isnt
as
good
as
the
la
trappe
quad
to
complement
this
beer
i
recommend
only
the
best
this
beer
is
meant
for
a
madrid
v
barcelona
soccer
match
or
charlie
mingus
cumbia
jazz
and
fusion
cheers
overall
a
fantastic
beer
wish
more
tasted
this
way
o
glad
i
finally
got
around
to
trying
this
beer
it
did
not
disappoint
i
would
highly
recommend
this
was
quite
a
treat
o
a
solid

d
this
is
a
beer
that
needs
to
be
slowly
sipped
given
its
alcohol
content
it
tastes
like
it
is
strong
but
the
alcohol
presence
does
not
detract
from
the
drinkability
for
the
most
part
the
alcohol
is
masked
from
the
taste
overall
this
beer
is
simply
worldclass
it
doesnt
receive
a
lot
of
hype
but
judging
by
its
rank
on
the
top
100
currently
10
its
no
secret
that
this
is
a
great
beer
serving
25
oz
corked

1
finger
of
light
amber
head
and
excellent
lacing
the
color
is
a
dark
brown
nearly
identical
to
the
color
of
most
brown
beer
bottles
i
really
didnt
get
a
good
aroma
it
seemed
pretty
bland
and
it
smelled
mostly
of
alcohol
i
thought
it
tasted
of
dried
fruits
and
a
malty
finish
abv
is
hidden
well
and
carbonation
was
high
but
not
too
much
for
a
10
5
this
was
very
easy
to
drink
and
went
down
smoothly
this
is
everything
i
look
for
in
a
beer
good
color
pleasant
aroma
high
abv
and
damn
tasty
they
really
got
the
flavor
right
on
this
one
sweet
and
malty
w
slight
fruity
overtones
just
to
the
point
of
hiding
the
high
alcohol
content
but
not
so
much
as
to
overpower
the
beer
they
even
did
a
good
job
on
the
labeling
i
love
the
image
of
the
happy
drunk
monk
if
i
were
a
beerbrewing
monk
thats
just
how
id
picture
myself
after
taking
down
a
couple
goblets
of
this
10
beast
this
continues
to
be
one
of
my
favorite
beers
and
i
seem
to
enjoy
it
more
each
time
a

well
done

a

like
a

on

i
love
this
beer
cant
drink
a

but
a
delicious
sipping

very
good

could
easily
down
a
large
bottle
of
this
stuff
even
with
the
high
alcohol
content
i
think
it
would
be
even
better
aged
this
beer
is
readily
available
by
me
which
is
great
a
little
pricey
but
definitely
worth
it
one
of
the
best
beers

notes
ive
been
dying
to
try
this
one
and
held
off
till
my
birthday
to
open
it
what
a
treat
i
happened
to
try
5
diff
beers
in
all
that
day
this
one
came
in
2nd
a
close
2nd
though
i
tried
this
with
a
piece
of
birthday
cake
and
it
went
perfectly
with
that
imo
a
dessert
beer
for
sure
i
would
recommend
this
to
anyone
d
great
quad
truly
a
stand
out
for
the
style
the
fact
that
its
so
easy
to
find
and
cheap
just
makes
me
even
happier
doesnt
make
the
beer
any
better
but
i
get
to
drink
it
more
often
a
truly
word
class
beer

2
oz
bottle
poured
into
a
st
bernardus
chalice
dark
mahogany
not
fined
beer
with
deep
chestnut
tones
monster
cream
head
typical
of
the
strong
carbonation
in
belgian
offerings
smell
is
of
caramel
malts
unrefined
sugar
and
that
all
too
familiar
peculiarity
of
a
belgian
yeast
phenols
with
bready
overtones
the
beer
tastes
like
figs
and
dates
and
caramel
and
toffee
bready
sweet
and
again
that
all
too
hard
to
put
your
finger
on
delicious
belgian
pecularity
incredibly
complex
incredibly
deep
that
improves
as
it
warms
one
of
the
top
few
beers
of
the
world
most
closely
resembles
the
westy
of
any
other
offering
absolutely
amazing
in
my
eyes
as
close
to
perfection
in
a
beer
as
you
can
get
this
is
so
good
it
hurts
lip
smacking
good
one
of
the
finest
examples
of
the
most
complex
tasting
beer
class
belgian
quads
this
beer
is
a
very
dark
garnet
with
about
an
inch
of
white
fluffy
head
which
recedes
to
about
a
quarter
inch
it
smells
amazing
with
notes
of
spice
figs
and
sweetness
it
tastes
amazing
as
well
with
a
taste
which
mirrors
the
nose
adding
a
little
bit
of
yeast
bite
and
some
caramel
these
flavors
mostly
if
not
completely
mask
the
high
abv
the
higher
carbonation
gives
it
a
deceivingly
light
mouthfeel
but
as
it
warms
and
the
carbonation
dissipates
it
becomes
thicker
most
drinkble
quad
i
have
ever
had
amazing
it
seems
like
it
would
hold
up
well
with
age
and
i
would
love
to
see
how
it
changes
with
a
year
on
it
d
excellent
this
is
the
bestdrinking
bsdquad
around
basically
a
better
version
of

d
im
on
my
second
pint
of
this
its
amazingly
sessionable
at
10
d
did
i
use
a
straw
cuz
that
was
gone
fast
the
pour
is
a
caramelamber
color
with
a
very
slight
head
perhaps
using
caramel
as
a
color
descriptor
is
a
product
of
the
smell
which
is
rich
in
caramel
and
dried
dark
fruits
the
figs
and
raisins
really
show
themselves
in
the
taste
along
with
vanilla
and
again
a
touch
of
caramel
its
really
malty
and
sweet
i
was
hoping
for
a
hint
of
banana
or
some
bubblegum
but
it
was
not
readily
apparent
felt
really
nice
with
some
decent
viscosity
id
like
to
get
another
bottle
to
have
sit
around
for
a
year
or
so
to
tame
the
booziness
but
this
is
the
only
one
ive
got
for
now
my
girlfriend
has
got
me
hooked
on
the
show
trueblood
and
in
it
2
people
get
high
on
vampire
blood
and
dance
around
feel
one
with
nature
themselves
and
the
world
this
beer
is
vampire
blood
mouthfeel
is

sugary
and
full
of

the
aroma
is
of

lovely

and
a

the
tast
consists
of
more
dark

flavors
some

brown

and
a
touch
of
fantastic
the
finish
is
so
wonderfully
clean
and
flavorful
d
taking
it
slow
with
this
one
each
sip
reveals
something
new
a
slow
drinker
for
sure
this
beer
represents
the
quad
style
phenomenally
mouthfeel
is
rich
and
smooth
warming
the
throat
a
light
effervescence
all
over
the
tongue
as
well
mediumfull
bodied
the
only
downside
i
found
was
a
bit
of
roughness
in
the
aftertaste
kind
of
a
bitter
cherryoak
flavor
that
being
said
this
is
an
absolute
cream
of
the
crop
beer
few
if
any
better
in
the
style
few
better
in
any
style
in
my
not
so
humble
opinion
i
cant
wait
to
age
some
of
these
bad
boys
jd
d
i
was
disappointed
by
this
to
be
honest
it
was
incredibly
well
balanced
and
nice
to
drink
but
it
was
underwhelming
the
flavors
were
weak
and
i
missed
out
on
the
strong
smells
others
described
i
had
an
amazing
dubbel
last
night
that
blows
this
beer
out
of
the
water
i
hardly
detected
any
malts
in
the
at
all
i
did
enjoy
drinking
it
though
and
i
want
to
try
it
again
sometime
soon
to
see
if
i
still
feel
the
same
way
about
it
d
just
a
perfect
beer
in
every
way
that
matters
one
of
may
all
time
favorite
goto
beers
i
poured
into
my
glass
to
a
couple
fingers
of
tan
head
it
is
a
dark
dark
amber
in
color
i
did
manage
to
get
some
chunks
of
yeast
in
there
too
the
smell
is
fruity
with
cherry
and
dark
berries
being
the
most
prominent
i
also
get
plenty
of
spices
along
with
some
caramel
malt
the
taste
is
sweet
and
spicy
im
usually
not
a
big
belgian
fan
but
this
beer
is
pretty
put
together
i
get
just
the
slightest
hops
taste
on
the
finish
this
beer
is
going
down
mighty
easily
for
a
high
abv
im
so
thrilled
to
finally
document
my
feelings
about
this
beer
this
is
one
of
those
beers
that
really
raised
my
awareness
and
fondness
of
belgians
years
ago
im
so
happy
to
have
had
this
chance
to
write
down
how
i
really
feel
this
is
my
love
letter
to
you
st
bernardus
abt

thanks
for
the
good
times
and
great
drinks
a
real
joy
to
drink
a
firstrate
belgian
strong
ale
a
high
abv
means
less
drinkability
but
id
gladly
spend
an
evening
with
a
tall
bottle
of
this
brilliant
man
o
man
what
à
beer
much
smoother
and
sweeter
than
the
bottel
version
awsome
one
of
the
best

beers
in
the
world

a

and
this
is
a
great

d
at

abv
this
one
will
sneak
up
on
you
keeping
it
from
being
too
quaffable
however
this
is
one
of
the
finest
beers
on
the
planet
and
a
true
benchmark
for
quads
it
would
be
hard
to
imagine
actually
drinking
a
better
beer
in
all
respects
it
delivers
what
it
promises
especially
is
the
taste
just
beautiful
this
is
a
clean
and
outstanding
beer
the
nose
is
a
spicy
yeasty
malty
combo
with
notes
of
dark
fruits
anyone
who
is
looking
to
introduce
someone
to
craft
beer
should
consider
this
as
a
first
beer
d
one
or
two
and
done
since
this
beer
is
pricey
but
without
thinking
about
the
price
i
would
still
say
its
about
the
same
since
the
beer
is
fairly
rich
in
flavor
the
mouthfeel
is
soft
and
silky
peppered
with
fine
carbonation
bitterness
is
present
but
not
a
focal
point
very
slick
with
a
lingering
doughy
coating
feel
in
the
finish
very

and
easy

drink

it

this
is
one
of
the

fine

i
prefer
this
beer
fresh
while
an
interesting
evolution
of
flavor
its
a
bit
sharp
and
sour
for
my
taste
wont
cellar
again
i
will
need
to
get
this
one
again
sometime
i
am
more
experienced
at
discerning
tastes
very
complex
very
good
beer
i
havent
had
many
quadrupels
but
this
is
definitely
the
best
i
have
gotten
around
to
the
mouthfeel
is
on
the
thicker
side
and
carbonation
is
moderate
to
below
average
drinkability
is
good
its
a
great
tasting
beer
for
the
style
and
abv
overall
an
excellent
beer
and
one
worth
all
of
its
praise
at
the
eulogy
tavern
in
philadelphia
into
a
chalice
poured
a
mahoganyreddish
color
with
slightly
less
than
a
finger
of
offwhite
which
collapsed
quickly
but
i
suspect
that
it
may
have
had
something
to
do
with
the
way
the
glass
was
washed
smelled
of
plum
raisin
sour
cherry
and
nutmeg
the
flavor
was
off
the
charts
molasses
nutmeg
plum
and
raisins
which
dissolved
to
a
sour
black
cherry
finish
which
zero
hint
of
the
high
alcohol
content
nicely
fullbodied
but
very
smooth
with
nearly
no
carbonation
despite
the
fact
that
this
is
a
strong
beer
id
make
an
attempt
at
sessioning
it
as
it
was
super
smooth
and
satisfying
needless
to
say
i
ordered
another
after
the
initial
sample
pours
a
dark
brown
colour
with
thin
head
was
expecting
the
head
to
be
a
bit
bigger
tons
of
raisin
and
plum
in
the
nose
had
a
lot
of
sweetness
almost
like
brown
sugar
toffee
flavour
was
impressively
huge
with
dark
bready
malt
raisin
plum
brown
sugar
caramel
and
i
think
i
got
a
bit
of
chocolate
a
very
creamy
mouthfeel
awesome
beer
my
3rd
favorite
of
the
4
was
a
little
disappointed
with
this
one
similar
in
style
to
the
westmalle
good
overall
taste
but
not
too
complex
in
flavor
overall
fairly
sweet
but
nothing
to
write
home
about
aroma
is
pleasant
and
sweet
but
i
dont
really
see
what
all
the
hubub
is
about
pours
a
dark
chocolate
haze
with
some
life
thin
head
has
an
aroma
of
grapefruit
with
hints
of
caramel
and
banana
has
a
creamy
doughy
bitter
taste
a
very
yeasty
feel
has
a
medium
body
that
thickens
nicely
as
it
warms
this
is
a
very
tasty
brew
had
ontap
at
monks
beer
emporium
in
philly
served
in
a
tulip
glass
didnt
get
to
see
the
pour
but
it
came
black
with
a
dark
creamy
head
flavor
was
dark
malt
with
the
promised
notes
of
chocolate
and
coffee
and
is
that
blueberry
yes
that
was
distinctly
a
blueberry
note
in
the
finish
the
complexity
in
this
beer
was
really
a
marvel
while
i
cant
give
as
detailed
a
description
as
id
like
without
having
taken
notes
this
was
absolutely
spectacular
might
knock
gulden
draak
off
its
throne
as
my
favorite
belgian
d
im
convinced
that
this
bottle
has
seen
better
days
as
the
retialer
that
i
purchased
it
from
has
a
questionable
reputation
i
assumed
that
i
couldnt
go
wrong
with
such
a
high
abv
brew
but
i
guess
i
was
mistaken
sadly
i
have
to
dump
this
one
due
to
the
yeast
chunkys
i
will
be
in
pittsburgh
next
month
and
i
will
stop
by
the
sharp
edge
the
best
belgian
beer
bar
ive
ever
heard
of
and
a
reputable
source
and
try
this
one
again
hopefully
on
tap
and
certainly
rereview
sadness
from
watou
to
alliance
sincerely
james
d
a
good
belgian
quad
one
of
the
best
drinkability
one
is
plenty
but
i
will
absolutely
be
buying
this
again
best
quad
ive
ever
had
d
i
really
enjoyed
this
and
i
believe
i
will
pick
up
a
couple
bottles
to
see
what
a
little
time
will
do
for
it
superb
brew
all
around
one
of
my
all
time
favorites
drinkability
nope
not
a
session
beer
too
much
booze
too
much
sweet
not
enough
balance
i
usually
like
st
bernadus
alot
the
prior
8
is
phenomenal
they
missed
on
this
one
how
do
you
add
anything
to
a
review
of
a
legendary
beer
not
much
can
be
said
that
cant
be
this
is
a
brew
that
must
be
drank
overall
a
world
class
beer
thats
a
must
try
if
youre
a
true
beer
lover
it
is
well
balanced
nothing
is
coming
out
too
much
as
to
mask
the
other
tastes
the
10
degree
of
alcool
is
well
soften
by
a
sweet
taste
but
not
as
much
as
the
rochefort
10
and
its
mouthfeel
the
hop
could
have
been
stronger
to
give
a
little
edge
d
pretty
good
quad
but
its
a
little
on
the
swwet
side
it
drinks
decent
but
starts
to
taste
like
leather
as
it
warms
up
excellent
beer
another
must
have
on
hand
a
very
drinkable
quad
even
at
10
5
abv
nicely
done
but
i
still
prefer
rochefort
10
this
is
a
supremely
drinkable
beer
although
ive
been
keen
on
trying
as
many
brews
as
i
can
lately
i
ordered
a
second
because
i
could
not
get
enough
poured
this
into
my
sa
glass
a
dark
brownish
color
with
about
two
fingers
of
an
off
white
head
that
laced
my
glass
throughtout
tasted
to
me
of
dark
fruitsraisinsplums
has
nice
carbonation
with
a
smooth
drinkability
with
some
alcohol
on
the
finish
overall
this
is
a
very
good
beer
i
must
try
this
on
draft
next
time
im
in
olde
city
i
could
down
these
for
a
while
at
least
until
i
passed
out
drunk
the
beer
pours
a
hazy
medium
brown
color
with
a
tan
head
the
head
appears
very
fluffy
and
soft
the
aroma
is
alcohol
dark
fruit
brown
sugar
yeast
and
candisugar
the
beer
smells
great
the
flavor
is
a
lot
of
dark
fruit
plums
and
raisins
with
some
brown
sugar
candisugar
yeast
and
alcohol
mediumthick
very
creamy
mouthfeel
and
soft
carbonation
this
is
what
a
quadrupel
is
supposed
to
taste
like
d
goes
down
very
well
for
the
style
abt
12
is
a
true
classic
that
deserves
mention
whenever
the
topic
turns
to
the
best
beers
on
the
planet
even
though
tripel
is
the
finest
ale
that
st
bernardus
has
to
offer
this
big
brew
isnt
far
behind
its
also
better
and
more
widely
available
than
either
trappistes
rochefort
10
or
westveleteren
12
dso
good
dark
malty
deliciousness
the
alcohol
is
really
well
hidden
for
10
5
such
a
great
beer
deven
though
the
alcohol
is
present
you
could
drink
it
all
day
excellent
drinkability
definitely
my
favorite
of
the
st
bernardus
lineup
smooth
complex
buttery
earthy
theres
something
very
comforting
about
this
beer
absolutely
lived
up
to
its
reputation
d
well
this
is
the
beer
that
really
showed
me
what
belgian
beers
are
all
about
early
in
my
craft
beer
drinking
time
it
is
still
just
as
good
as
i
remember
however
i
pick
up
much
more
delicate
flavors
as
my
palate
has
developed
i
would
highly
recommend
this
for
anyone
interested
in
belgian
brews
d
a
sipper
for
sure
slightly
hot
on
the
finish
but
it
does
a
pretty
phenomenal
job
hiding
the
alcohol
incredible
malt
character
i
recommend
a
slightly
warmer
temperature
for
serving
50f
really
opens
it
up
fantastic
brew
i
think
i
like
it
even
a
bit
better
than
the
rochefort
10
which
is
hard
for
me
i
love
that
beer
in
my
top
10
all
time
snifter
pour
and
i
am
met
with
a
murky
dark
brown
ale
with
a
big
fluffy
head
of
foam
with
staying
power
the
aroma
consists
of
raspberries
tart
apple
pear
and
other
darker
fruits
well
done
bubbly
taste
with
a
fruity
flavor
and
some
mild
malt
on
the
swallow
and
a
slight
peppery
taste
a
nice
looong
aftertaste
is
present
with
a
lot
going
on
well
after
the
sip
is
down
a
slight
numbing
effect
on
the
gums
foam
with
every
sip
is
a
nice
touch
drinkability
is
way
high
as
the
going
down
is
very
easy
dealing
with
the
aftereffects
not
so
much
a
world
class
beer
to
be
enjoyed
by
all
d
one
of
the
best
friend
of
beer
lovers
dangerously
drinkable
ive
had
better
quads
but
this
one
is
up
there
towards
the
top
would
drink
again
d
tastes
heavier
and
heavier
as
the
bottle
progresses
but
is
not
overwhelming
this
is
a
classic
belgian
ale
and
a
rival
for
any
pretender
its
been
known
to
win
blind
tastings
with
westvleteren
to
boot
thick
earthy
fruity
flavor
masks
a
surprisingly
high
takeyouoffguard
kind
of
abv
awesomelooking
bottle
which
might
inspire
friends
to
suggest
that
you
have
some
kind
of
magic
elixir
in
your
closet
the
grinning
abbeyfellow
is
occasionally
described
as
creepy
by
my
less
beersnobbish
friends
not
quite
as
creamy
as
id
expected
but
the
thick
luxurious
head
makes
up
for
it
for
an
instant
you
are
not
a
man
but
a
monk
a
purveyor
of
divine
secrets
and
holy
inspiration
my
only
gripe
is
the
slightly
prohibitive
cost
this
beer
is
absolutely
worth
trying
but
save
em
for
special
occasions
drinkability
like
most
quality
belgians
this
beer
is
too
drinkable
for
the
alcohol
level
you
can
easily
sit
and
drink
a
bottle
of
this
brew
earns
an
easy
recommendation
from
me
notes
more
please
di
am
loven
this
beer
but
i
am
not
sure
i
would
be
up
to
drinking
to
much
of
it
the
flavor
is
exceptional
but
the
alcohol
might
be
just
a
bit
to
high
to
drink
this
all
night
but
this
one
is
dependable
always
around
and
solid
enough
d
a
solid
quad
that
has
everything
in
the
right
place
for
the
style
a
crisp
ripe
flavor
i
can
finally
see
after
having
3
bad
bottles
why
just
about
everyone
has
given
this
good
reviews
its
not
the
best
but
definitely
a
classic
example
of
the
style
taste
is
a
bit
sharp
and
boozy
but
it
should
fall
off
into
the
background
as
it
warms
up
at
bit
mouthfeel
is
very
full
and
crisp
theres
lots
of
earthy
nutty
notes
to
this
finish
is
really
malty
really
great
representation
of
the
style
d
this
is
a
heavy
beer
definitely
to
be
consumed
slowly
but
enjoyable
nonetheless
drinkability
this
was
hard
for
me
to
get
through
initially
as
it
was
the
first
quad
id
tried
in
retrospect
a
really
enjoyable
beverage
for
the
style
the
dominant
alcohol
makes
this
the
hardest
to
give
a
high
drinkability
rating
but
would
be
great
aged
i
need
to
plan
on
an
aged
bottle
soon
wow
the
taste
is
immediately
very
thick
and
malty
with
intense
apple
and
banana
flavors
as
well
as
a
brief
alcoholic
warming
sweet
hard
candies
and
a
sharp
tartness
are
in
there
as
well
silkysmooth
mouthfeel
and
intense
but
fine
carbonation
give
an
amazing
tactile
dimension
to
this
brew
fantastic
drinkability
this
has
to
be
one
of
the
most
balanced
quads
ive
ever
had
there
is
nothing
offensive
about
this
beer
the
look
is
coppery
but
not
thick
the
nose
is
small
with
hints
of
sweetness
like
dried
fruits
but
doesnt
play
the
starring
role
i
actually
think
the
drinkability
is
the
real
winner
on
this
one
since
nothing
is
standing
out
as
the
main
influence
here
its
hard
to
pick
it
apart
the
high
alcohol
would
be
the
only
catalyst
here
because
id
be
expecting
it
to
go
down
a
little
hot
but
it
doesnt
i
had
this
on
tap
one
time
at
our
place
and
it
lasted
12
hours
definitely
one
i
will
get
again
when
it
becomes
available
on
the
bottle
bringing
heavenly
nectar
within
reach
indeed
this
one
rates
on
my
personal
beer
scale
as
nectar
of
the
gods
there
is
something
about
the
belgians
that
really
get
to
my
heart
future
husband
if
you
are
out
there
take
note
ive
just
given
a
hint
to
one
of
the
keys
to
my
heart
and
it
isnt
flowers
opened
up
a
2010
bottle
that
is
a
little
over
3
years
old
at
this
point
huge
dark
fruit
red
grape
raisin
overtakes
other
flavors
a
little
bit
but
still
quite
excellent
and
opens
more
with
warmth
mouthfeel
maybe
has
thinned
out
a
little
too
but
still
amply
carbonated
great
beer
d
it
should
come
as
no
surprise
that
this
is
a
world
class
quad
offering
easy
drinking
no
real
complaints
though
the
alcohol
sticks
a
little
more
than
i
would
have
expected
hindering
drinkability
ever
so
slightly
for
me
this
is
a
great
nightcap
and
i
will
continue
to
enjoy
it
regularly
in
my
opinion
this
is
a
great
dinner
or
dessert
beer
super
delicious
popped
the
cork
and
gave
a
gentle
pour
into
my
chalice
wow
tilting
the
glass
and
pouring
as
gently
as
i
could
the
head
exploded
a
rich
creamy
off
white
fluffy
head
looks
beautiful
i
couldnt
believe
the
amount
of
head
on
this
beer
for
a
10
percent
abv
ale
the
most
impressive
ive
seen
to
date
lots
of
good
carbonation
as
well
the
body
is
a
deep
hazy
brown
this
beer
is
beautiful
all
sorts
of
fruit
in
the
aroma
the
tasty
is
a
sweet
grainy
sensation
the
alcohol
was
a
bit
warming
so
it
did
take
me
a
little
longer
to
drink
quite
an
amazing
beer
a
really
excellent
worldclass
quad
pretty
sure
we
all
know
that
going
in
whose
key
words
i
would
choose
spicy
earthy
and
warming
not
sure
i
would
grab
more
than
one
at
a
time
this
beer
makes
me
think
it
would
enjoy
some
time
in
the
cellar
could
see
this
being
mindblowing
d
highly
recommended
a
world
class
beer
warming
and
delicious
this
is
for
sipping
but
each
sip
begs
another
this
beer
is
about
as
good
as
it
gets
imo
abt
12
abbey
ale
brewed
in
the
classic
dubbel
style
of
of
belgiums
best
abbey
ales
serve
this
noble
and
wonderfully
balanced
brown
ale
at
5256f
in
a
goblet
glass
to
best
enjoy
its
delicate
bouquet
d
it
is
damn
near
magical
that
they
have
hidden
a
10
abv
according
to
my
bottle
not
10
5
in
this
beer
it
is
so
flavorful
and
balanced
the
alcohol
warms
and
tingles
but
is
not
harsh
in
any
way
a
great
beer
that
should
be
sipped
or
it
will
sneak
up
on
you
quick
and
it
is
hard
to
sip
this
is
a
beer
ill
drink
until
it
is
clear
i
shuddah
stopped
addictive
lightly
carbonated
this
is
not
as
a
heavy
of
a
beer
as
the
abv
made
me
think
it
would
be
very
enjoyable
one
of
the
best
belgian
beers
ive
tried
overall
a
true
treat
and
a
relatively
accessible
precedent
for
the
world
of
beer
overall
impression
this
is
my
new
favorite
quad
absolutely
yumiliscious
d
easy
to
sip
for
a
10
beer
despite
the
big
warming
alcohol
kick
this
was
very
easy
to
drink
probably
the
thin
mouthfeel
that
did
it
but
i
could
definitely
go
for
another
one
drinkability
one
of
the
most
inviting
brews
ive
ever
tasted
i
approached
the
abt
12
like
a
sipper
but
it
disappeared
quicker
than
i
anticipated
primarily
because
of
a
wellhidden
abv
and
smoothness
on
the
palate
d
an
amazing
quad
to
sip
or
pair
with
a
funky
cheese
overall
this
is
a
great
belgian
that
is
thankfully
not
too
hard
to
find
pour
is
a
deep
brown
with
hints
of
cherry
reminds
me
of
my
kitchen
cabinets
with
a
large
frothy
head
that
is
well
retained
floaters
abound
smell
is
of
candied
sugar
and
prunes
there
is
a
bite
on
the
tongue
followed
by
a
sweetness
with
dark
fruit
cant
put
y
finger
on
it
but
the
finish
is
the
least
enjoyable
part
of
the
beer
so
far
the
body
is
medium
to
full
and
smooth
with
a
creamy
feel
to
it
drinkability
is
decent
but
not
great
due
to
the
finish
that
is
not
agreable
to
my
taste
overall
an
excellent
beer
all
around
for
the
price
of
4
49
a
bottle
ill
definitely
be
buying
more
i
would
highly
recommend
seeking
this
one
out
this
is
just
a
great
beer
mouthfeel
is
typical
of
something
on
this
level
carbonation
is
high
body
is
moderate
and
it
all
comes
together
in
a
gourmetstyle
and
beautifully
put
together
beer
yummy
stuff
could
probably
drink
all
day
and
then
some
adios
and
vote
libertarian
d
this
is
one
that
i
can
drink
all
night
long
but
at
an
extremely
slow
pace
this
is
a
world
class
beer
i
can
tell
its
a
bit
rough
and
need
some
time
to
mellow
out
the
date
on
the
bottle
is
11182013
so
i
think
this
one
is
young
depending
on
how
the
brewery
date
its
beers
i
am
going
to
age
one
for
some
time
and
see
what
happens
it
is
lacking
a
bit
of
balance
i
dont
think
its
as
rich
as
rochefort
10
reviewed
from
my
notes
abt
12
has
a
deep
plum
color
a
thin
grey
head
settled
to
a
skim
of
bubbles
there
is
lots
of
bubbles
clinging
to
the
sides
of
the
glass
it
has
a
spicy
aroma
with
some
lightly
sweet
malts
and
a
little
bit
of
musty
belgian
yeast
there
is
a
purple
fruit
in
there
as
well
red
grapes
or
plums
it
has
a
good
crisp
complex
flavor
i
can
pick
out
a
graham
crackerlike
grain
quality
to
it
i
can
also
taste
red
and
white
grapes
especially
in
the
finish
there
is
a
small
bite
of
alcohol
and
floral
hops
in
the
aftertaste
overall
its
a
hearty
big
flavor
it
feels
very
crisp
with
lots
of
carbonation
the
coating
feels
very
good
it
leaves
a
lot
of
malty
flavor
behind
its
very
drinkable
it
gets
better
as
it
warms
up
this
is
one
worth
drinking
slowly
and
ordered
repeatedly
d
this
will
probably
end
up
a
drainpour
simply
because
of
how
much
sediment
is
in
the
glass
i
cant
take
a
sip
without
getting
a
mouthful
everything
ive
had
in
the
gift
pack
from
them
has
had
the
same
problem
i
wish
they
didnt
perhaps
ill
try
another
one
sometime
but
probably
not
soon
so
many
flavors
every
sip
is
different
the
beer
is
complex
pours
dark
amber
brown
and
a
head

of
the

malts
yeasty

be
careful
though
this
one
could
definitely
catch
up
to
you
fast
exceptional
brew
from
at
the
time
of
this
review
my
opinion
an
underrated
brewery
if
you
like
belgian
beer
you
are
in
for
a
treat
a
great
all
around
beer
very
drinkable
it
hides
all
of
the
alcohol
really
well
plenty
of
balance
and
depth
that
is
expected
for
the
style
all
in
all
a
really
nice
abbey
ale
there
are
others
out
there
that
i
prefer
more
but
not
many
d
like
the
tune
from
lionel
richie
all
night
long
notes
really
nice
beer
with
lots
of
complex
flavors
a
lot
of
spice
in
this
beer
good
example
of
the
style
and
a
good
example
of
craft
beer
in
general
verdict
must
drink
this
beer
not
just
try
it
but
like
it
and
drink
more
of
it
if
you
do
not
like
it
seek
medical
help
this
is
one
of
my
favorite
quads
cheap
uber
drinkable
an
all
around
great
deal
i
cant
imagine
someone
being
dissatisfied
with
this
beer
overall
not
that
impressive
to
be
honest
i
expected
a
lot
better
somewhat
weak
in
taste
but
well
brewed
essentially
i
think
it
should
not
be
tasted
next
to
the
rochefort
in
my
opinion
overall
i
will
drink
this
many
times
in
the
future
its
pretty
high
abv
to
drink
several
in
a
row
but
it
is
very
tasty
a
really
solid
beer
lots
of
great
layers
and
bold
flavors
working
together
in
harmony
best
quad
ive
had
so
far
definitely
a
sipper
and
definitely
for
dessert
dvery
drinkable
a
solid
taste
but
with
a
high
abv
definately
a
beer
you
could
have
around
three
of
but
not
really
to
enjoy
all
night
unless
total
intoxication
and
dropping
alot
of
change
is
your
goal
the
quad
from
st
bernardus
little
bottles
poured
into
a
tulip
glass
a
sipper
slowly
enjoyed
smoothsmooth
beer
one
of
the
smoothest
out
there
alcohol
hides
very
well
i
enjoy
this
one
as
it
gets
warmer
great
beer
to
have
with
friends
i
dont
drink
this
alone
sociable
beer
high
drinkability
and
always
enjoyed
with
good
music
thanx
st
bernardus
one
of
my
favorites
d
overall
i
thought
this
was
a
very
good
belgian
quad
it
smelled
and
tasted
great
and
was
a
very
nice
smooth
balance
between
sweeter
malts
and
breadyeast
would
love
to
have
this
again
the
only
thing
aganist
it
might
be
that
the
10
5
abv
will
limit
the
amount
youd
have
in
one
night
drinkability
an
excellent
and
refreshing
beer
that
i
could
have
several
of
my
favorite
from
the
brewery
is
still
the
six
though
i
do
like
the
applebrown
sugar
taste
pours
a
very
dark
brown
with
lighter
walnut
tinges
along
the
edges
the
fingerthick
head
half
dies
leaving
a
lovely
creamy
remainder
that
laces
very
well
the
aroma
is
sweet
and
tangy
with
a
nice
effervescent
fruitiness
dominating
the
taste
corroborates
the
nose
with
those
fruits
coming
back
with
a
sweet
vengeance
those
lovely
malts
including
a
hint
of
molassesmaple
syrup
all
the
way
in
the
back
the
body
is
a
heavy
medium
but
does
not
sit
poorly
rather
it
stands
at
attention
saluting
declaring
itself
but
not
overpowering
yeah
this
could
be
a
benchmark
for
belgian
strong
dark
quad
beers
absolutely
lovely
fresh
or
aged
up
to
7
or
more
years
beautifully
balanced
malt
body
of
rich
dark
fruit
raisins
toffee
roasted
malts
dark
chocolate
all
blended
together
where
none
stands
out
overwhelmingly
big
alcohol
but
not
hot
great
with
soups
meat
or
rich
vegie
dishes
deserts
ive
had
this
in
belgium
in
various
states
on
tap
in
small
big
and
very
big
bottles
this
is
a
great
beer
to
serve
fresh
or
after
years
of
aging
i
should
add
that
while
my
rating
across
the
board
indicates
5
0
i
cant
add
my
own
specific
point
rating
say
4
6
for
mouthfeel
theres
a
few
beers
i
might
want
to
rate
higher
but
this
is
definitely
in
the
running
for
a
dessert
island
beer
exceptional
d
cant
argue
with
the
drinkability
here
it
went
down
perfectly
smooth
and
i
wouldnt
have
suspected
10
5
abv
this
is
my
favorite
belgian
quadrupel
and
in
my
opinion
even
compares
with
more
exotic
and
rare
versions
of
the
style
only
available
in
belgium
its
even
more
enjoyable
with
age
and
at
10
5
abv
it
can
age
for
quite
some
time
with
no
adverse
effects
overall
definitely
a
new
favorite
excellent
belgian
ale
in
every
way
the
interesting
esters
and
hints
of
malt
combined
with
the
ability
to
hide
an
abv
of
10
make
this
a
deceptively
drinkable
brew
by
all
means
grab
a
bottle
and
find
out
for
yourself
a
glass
or
two
later
and
youll
be
damn
satisfied
and
drunk
d
very
high
except
for
the
higher
abv
a
750
ml
bottle
would
be
enough
was
able
to
pick
this
brew
up
in
my
last
trip
to
the
store
had
been
looking
for
it
for
a
while
but
just
had
not
been
carried
the
brew
pours
to
a
deep
murky
brown
color
with
a
small
to
medium
tan
had
that
has
a
creamy
consistence
good
retention
and
has
left
a
fair
amount
of
lacing
the
aroma
of
this
brew
is
a
nice
mix
of
malts
dark
fruit
plums
and
cherries
candy
sugar
and
a
yeast
slurry
really
inviting
aromas
for
this
one
has
a
excellent
favor
malts
come
through
here
and
make
a
great
base
slight
caramel
flavor
fruit
seems
to
be
there
raisons
plums
and
slight
cherry
flavors
slight
port
like
flavor
that
really
goes
well
with
everything
seems
to
linger
a
bit
on
the
tongue
excellent
some
sweetness
is
there
that
is
real
nice
candy
sugar
and
is
not
over
the
top
has
a
slight
spice
to
it
as
well
this
one
drinks
very
well
goes
down
smooth
cant
believe
that
it
is
10
overall
this
is
a
simply
excellent
brew
i
really
can
not
see
a
major
flaw
with
anything
this
is
a
beer
that
everybody
needs
to
try
once
i
try
to
have
at
least
two
every
year
this
may
be
my
favorite
out
of
the
st
bernardus
lineup
but
its
in
a
tight
race
with
the
pator
8
that
stuff
is
also
excellent
very
drinkable
but
unfortunately
expensivebest
for
special
occasions
bottom
line
this
beer
is
sweet
strong
and
smooth
with
a
high
alcohol
content
that
you
wouldnt
expect
with
the
amazing
flavor
the
flavor
and
drinkability
are
top
notch
and
the
only
draw
back
is
the
appearance
this
is
a
huge
sweet
belgian
and
yes
it
lives
up
to
its
name
stop
reading
about
it
and
drink
it
drink
is
good
for
a
10
5
abv
this
is
easily
enjoyable
for
any
type
of
beer
drinker
the
beer
pours
a
very
dark
amber
brown
and
gives
a
very
nice
amount
of
head
with
amazing
lacing
the
smell
is
spiced
and
a
bit
funky
with
bananas
coming
to
mind
which
im
not
a
big
fan
of
the
taste
is
much
better
than
the
smell
exceptional
flavor
of
spices
dark
fruit
and
yes
a
tiny
bit
of
banana
and
vanilla
mouthfeel
is
very
normal
for
a
belgian
substantial
with
a
bit
of
sediment
drinkability
is
reasonable
for
a
belgian
i
couldnt
help
feeling
like
my
palate
had
just
been
assaulted
though
pours
a
hazy
dark
ruby
color
with
a
creamy
12
finger
head
with
a
beige
ring
and
clinging
lace
on
the
glass
best
by
070514
the
smell
was
great
it
was
plum
fig
clove
spice
and
other
fruits
mixed
with
some
sweet
malts
the
taste
was
very
good
it
was
plum
pears
and
apples
with
cinnamon
and
nutmeg
some
raisins
and
bananas
some
bready
tastes
with
caramel
and
malts
it
was
sweet
and
bready
and
malty
with
a
clove
yeast
finish
very
well
balanced
with
a
trace
of
alcohol
burn
it
is
well
hidden
my
330
ml
bottle
went
down
fast
drinkability
was
good
but
i
wish
i
would
have
reviewed
a
fresh
bottle
quite
the
quad
worth
seeking
out
pick
up
the
750ml
bottle
if
you
see
it
because
11oz
just
isnt
enough
fig
some
prune
less
plum
tobacco
clove
butterscotch
and
caramel
this
beer
runs
the
gamut
very
easy
to
quaff
d
one
of
my
favorites
its
a
very
comfortable
beer
to
go
back
to
again
and
again
oh
its
just
so
good
pours
a
deep
mahogony
with
a
fair
bit
of
sediment
and
a
giant
frothy
off
white
head
smells
of
bubblegum
bananna
and
a
slight
sweet
mustiness
flavor
is
nutty
sweet
a
bit
astringent
finishing
with
a
bananna
clove
flavor
very
alcoholic
on
the
finish
mouthfeel
is
a
little
thin
and
quite
carbonated
a
really
tasty
beer
but
i
still
much
prefer
rochefort
or
even
la
trappe
d
goes
down
so
smooth
and
the
alcohol
never
makes
its
presence
known
the
mere
fact
that
it
exceeds
10
abv
is
the
only
reason
it
doesnt
score
a
perfect
5
in
the
drinkability
department
a
world
class
quad
for
sure
there
is
no
doubt
about
that
the
only
question
is
would
i
like
this
or
westy
12
better
only
time
will
tell
gotta
get
me
a
bottle
of
that
first
though
review
from
notes
taken
on
121909
d
what
a
great
beer
i
hope
to
purchase
this
again
and
enjoy
it
outside
of
a
bar
to
get
the
full
effect
this
lived
up
to
the
hype
this
is
my
final
beer
that
i
bought
in
a
st
bernardus
gift
pack
i
am
not
a
huge
fan
of
the
malt
bomb
beers
but
this
is
not
that
bad
something
that
i
would
have
again
as
a
change
up
from
the
hoppy
ipas
that
i
usually
favor
d
a
great
quad
with
awesome
complexities
just
a
question
though
if
the
6
and
8
had
6
and
8
abv
respectively
why
is
12
named
12
despite
the
fact
it
only
has
10
abv
anyway
its
a
really
enjoyable
quad
that
i
could
sip
for
a
while
this
is
a
very
good
quadrupel
but
i
cant
match
the
westy
12
and
the
rochefort
10
i
have
a
second
bottle
which
i
will
drink
in
a
few
weeks
to
see
if
my
comment
is
still
the
same
drinkability
is
thankfully
not
outrageously
high
or
i
would
be
on
the
floor
that
being
said
you
are
left
wanting
more
d
this
one
is
not
meant
to
quaff
in
large
amounts
of
course
the
price
of
it
alone
probably
wont
allow
it
anyway
unless
youre
donald
trump
good
stuff
to
sip
and
enjoy
with
dark
chocolate
or
sharp
cheese
this
is
a
beer
i
can
enjoy
all
night
the
smell
was
the
highlight
of
this
brew
for
me
would
have
liked
to
give
it
a
4
75
and
the
taste
a
4
25
so
i
compromised
on
my
scores
taste
was
real
good
though
not
quite
as
complex
as
i
thought
it
would
be
im
sure
it
will
be
even
more
delightful
with
a
few
years
of
age
in
it
wow
wow
wow
wow
this
is
always
my
favorite
beer
poured
from
tap
into
a
proper
bernardus
glass
medium
brown
body
with
off
white
head
the
flavors
and
textures
are
immaculate
it
makes
you
go
back
in
for
another
sip
right
away
i
only
hope
one
day
i
can
go
visit
the
monstary
d
the
alcohol
makes
itself
known
more
in
terms
of
the
subtle
warmth
it
provides
the
beer
but
isnt
aggressive
by
any
means
the
flavors
are
sweet
but
balanced
and
are
helped
out
by
the
carbonation
an
amazing
delicious
brew
that
is
one
of
my
favorites
wish
i
could
afford
to
drink
this
regularly
oh
and
this
monk
packs
a
punch
overall
a
great
intro
to
quadrupels
overall
not
too
much
carbonation
but
seemed
on
point
for
the
style
a
good
quad
and
one
that
would
recommend
at
that
d
would
definitely
have
another
very
drinkable
note
do
not
believe
the
hype
that
this
is
the
same
beer
as
westvleteren
12
it
may
be
of
the
same
recipe
but
is
not
of
the
same
class
notes
a
very
nice
quaddubbel
and
somewhat
underrated
mmmm
lacks
a
minor
kick
to
make
it
a
total
favorite
but
there
is
not
a
trace
of
displeasure
in
drinking
this
one
pours
with
a
threefinger
light
tan
head
that
fades
slowly
leaving
a
good
lace
cloudy
brownamber
color
good
carbonation
and
medium
bodied
nose
is
raisincaramel
starts
sweet
has
a
raisincaramel
flavor
mellow
finish
better
as
it
warms
hints
of
alcohol
part
of
a
gift
4pak
that
was
17
00
from
tullys
beer
wine
wells
me
best
before
date
of
aug
13
2014
i
couldnt
wait
drinkability
it
would
take
me
some
time
to
finish
a
few
of
these
but
time
well
spent
carbonation
with
sweet
dark
spicey
clove
and
slightly
dry
end
to
finish
makes
this
one
of
my
new
favorites
at
the
bar
thanks
matt
lonardo
coowner
for
this
find
the
feel
is
a
but
medium
bodies
and
goes
down
well
d
st
bernardus
consistently
produces
a
quality
product
abt
12
is
in
a
class
of
its
own
this
is
a
fine
beer
but
beware
its
strong
a
wonderful
selection
a
real
treat
fruity
nose
and
rather
complex
mingling
red
fruit
grapes
plums
and
also
a
delicious
smell
of
brown
sugar
the
entry
in
the
mouth
is
a
drought
of
toast
only
then
the
flavors
of
fruit
soaked
in
alcohol
and
coconut
are
emerging
finish
of
roasted
malt
the
alcoholic
strength
is
not
quickly
discernable
which
makes
this
beer
a
compromise
gentle
enough
for
style
quadrupel
this
is
transcendant
delicious
i
cant
get
enough
the
world
needs
this
beer
overall
one
of
my
favorite
beers
of
all
time
the
head
nose
and
lacing
remains
strong
through
out
the
goblet
all
the
sensory
impact
of
this
beer
lends
it
to
be
very
drinkable
dare
i
say
addictive
i
have
one
more
750ml
bottle
that
i
will
keep
for
10
years
before
i
open
i
really
want
to
see
how
this
ages
this
is
an
awesome
brew
even
better
if
you
let
one
age
a
few
years
along
this
lines
of
a
westy
and
chimay
grand
reserve
great
raisin
dark
fruit
flavor
slight
alcohol
presence
but
overall
a
belgian
classic
as
this
bad
boy
warms
the
flavors
seem
to
get
more
interesting
as
well
nice
easy
malt
back
bone
with
the
classic
belgian
yeast
flavor
great
brew
for
sure
nothing
spectacular
about
the
drinkability
that
would
make
it
the
extra
point
but
really
good
dthis
is
so
smooth
and
sweet
with
huge
fruit
flavor
an
amazing
mouthfeel
and
huge
alcohol
that
is
not
present
at
all
taste
nice
sweetness
to
it
but
very
good
in
the
amount
with
a
slightly
toasted
taste
even
though
the
abv
is
really
high
there
is
very
little
taste
of
it
merry
christmas
final
note
not
that
i
need
to
say
this
as
its
written
on
the
bottle
but
this
beer
is
begging
to
be
aged
huge
complexity
right
off
the
shelf
plus
strong
carbonation
plus
high
abv
plus
a
bigger
hoppiness
than
most
belgian
strong
ales
equals
this
beer
couldnt
be
anything
but
amazing
with
a
few
years
of
age
on
it
dark
brown
with
hints
of
mahogany
showing
through
two
fingers
of

nothing
about
this

is

very
nicely
balanced
and
looks
great
in
the
glass
drinkability
is
def
better
than
average
for
this
abv
but
not
for
sessioning
high
marks
i
remember
this
being
a
lil
better
the
first
time
i
had
it
maybe
im
not
remembering
correctly
d
you
sip
this
not
because
you
have
to
but
rather
you
do
because
you
want
to
savor
every
last
drop
of
this
heavenly
goodness
this
is
the
beer
that
made
the
lightbulb
turn
on
when
i
started
trying
different
styles
at
the
beginning
of
my
craft
beer
journey
i
still
think
its
the
best
of
all
the
quads
ive
tried
but
i
havent
yet
had
a
westy
12
drinkability
buy
4
bottles
cellar
two
and
share
two
immediately
with
friends
this
is
pretty
special
overall
this
beer
is
outstanding
with
out
a
doubt
i
found
myself
taking
smaller
drinks
each
time
to
try
and
savor
the
flavor
and
to
push
myself
to
find
new
flavor
notes
id
highly
suggest
this
beer
to
anyone
cheers
drinkability
wow
no
wonder
this
is
one
of
the
top
beers
amazing
flavors
well
blended
and
backed
by
great
b
d
well
you
almost
never
cant
go
wrong
with
a
quad
and
this
beer
is
no
exception
a
really
nice
and
complex
beer
a
half
fingers
worth
of
lighttan
head
with
decent
retention
color
was
a
deep
brown
with
ruby
highlights
nose
was
dried
dark

prunes
raisins
blackberries
mouthfeel
was
full
with
some
heat
and
a
fruity

finish
was
juicy
sweet
raisiny
why
did
i
let
the
chauffeur
talk
me
into
this
too
good
to
be
true
overall
this
is
a
great
beer
and
a
truly
unique
belgian
in
my
mind
flavors
are
incredibly
profound
cheers
drinkability
huge
beer
here
so
dont
get
carried
away
but
for
its
abv
its
incredibly
drinkable
overall
the
mouth
feel
is
strong
alcohol
warming
carbonation
and
slightly
astringent
the
body
of
the
beer
is
medium
with
a
full
finish
this
beer
is
on
steroids
the
flavors
just
blow
up
in
your
mouth
and
yet
it
is
pleasant
to
drink
i
have
only
review
a
few
quads
and
this
is
one
of
the
better
ones
that
i
have
tried
i
was
in
fear
that
since
the
bottle
erupted
on
me
that
it
was
going
to
compromise
the
beers
flavor
nonetheless
i
feel
that
it
has
but
it
still
it
very
good
wow
rereviewing
this
beer
makes
me
realize
how
far
i
have
come
i
cant
believe
i
couldnt
appreciate
how
excellent
it
was
the
first
time
around
i
gave
it
a
b
a
real
pleasure
it
was
served
to
me
with
a
nice
finger
of
head
which
lingered
above
the
beer
which
had
a
dark
brown
almost
chocolate
like
color
the
nose
was
spicy
clove
with
hints
of
sweet
fruit
raisin
and
plum
perhaps
the
taste
is
both
biscuity
spicy
and
sweet
all
at
once
although
there
is
an
alcohol
presence
it
is
not
over
the
top
but
rather
soothing
and
warming
this
is
a
thick
strong
sweet
beer
that
if
you
are
not
careful
could
turn
into
a
session
beer
and
lead
to
questions
of
what
went
on
the
night
before
one
thing
you
will
not
have
to
question
however
is
whether
or
not
this
beer
is
worth
its
price
i
gave
it
a
4
on
drinkability
just
because
i
dont
think
this
could
be
drunk
over
the
course
of
a
whole
evening
then
again
i
only
really
need
one
or
two
i
started
drinking
this
after
dinner
and
then
went
to
play
wii
but
found
that
the
beer
took
more
of
a
break
because
it
needed
my
full
attention
to
drink
there
was
no
way
i
could
gulp
this
down
quickly
d
the
alcohol
is
there
slightly
this
is
a
pretty
warming
beer
im
not
sure
why
it
took
me
so
long
to
find
this
up
there
with
the
legit
trappists
d
like
most
quadtruples
it
hides
the
alcohol
well
i
could
drink
several
of
these
without
much
trouble
the
cost
is
high
though
so
one
at
a
time
will
have
to
do
d
quads
in
general
are
tough
for
me
in
the
drinkability
category
lots
of
alcohol
that
tends
to
be
on
the
hot
side
not
at
all
subtle
this
is
no
exception
definitely
a
sipper
has
good
flavor
and
aroma
and
is
a
really
pretty
beer
but
one
is
definitely
enough
in
a
sitting
very
good
but
tough
to
drink
a
lot
of
pours
a
deep
muddy
ruby
brown
with
a
nice
tanoff
white
head
aroma
of
dried
fruits
rasins
oranges
and
cherries
also
a
nice
malty
aroma
taste
is
just
what
you
would
expect
a
malty
smoothness
followed
by
dark
cherries
and
fig
sweetness
although
it
has
a
high
abv
its
very
well
hidden
and
makes
this
a
real
nice
multisipper
if
you
take
your
time
make
sure
to
let
it
warm
a
little
as
this
will
really
bring
out
the
great
flavors
of
this
beer
the
smell
and
taste
were
fruity
sweet
and
full
of
alcohol
like
cherries
and
orange
slices
soaked
in
booze
the
feel
was
smooth
with
a
touch
of
bitterness
the
high
abv
provides
a
nice
warmth
this
ale
is
a
sweet
and
warming
sipper
d
what
many
consider
one
of
the
quintessential
beers
and
quite
possibly
the
closest
thing
to
westveterlan
12
pours
a
slightly
hazy
deep
brown
with
a
huge
off
white
head
that
slowly
dissipates
to
a
cap
as
it
sticks
itself
all
over
my
glass
smells
of
dark
fruits
raisins
prunes
fig
come
to
mind
also
has
a
sweet
dark
sugar
and
molasses
aroma
as
well
twinge
of
alcohol
evident
too
taste
is
sweet
with
dark
fruits
molasses
brown
bread
melanoidin
and
alcohol
carbonation
is
high
mouthfeel
is
full
and
sticky
sweet
body
is
thick
i
liked
this
one
but
i
thought
the
alcohol
was
a
little
to
present
good
but
maybe
needs
some
age
to
mellow
it
out
a
bit
i
also
would
have
liked
a
bit
less
carbonation
d
delicious
great
from
start
to
finish
a
classic
and
a
must
try
conclusion
this
is
crazy
soft
supple
fruity
and
delicious
glad
i
got
to
try
it
on
tap
drinkability
i
had
high
hopes
going
into
tasting
this
beer
and
it
did
not
disappoint
i
will
definitely
be
buying
more
to
drink
and
some
to
age
to
see
what
other
aromas
and
flavors
come
out
of
some
age
bottle
pours
a
dark
ruby
brown
with
a
decent
amount
of
carbination
smell
and
taste
is
of
dark
fruits
with
a
nice
malt
background
in
it
too
the
alc
is
so
goddamn
well
hidden
its
insane
this
was
very
easy
to
drink
and
i
probably
drank
it
too
fast
i
couldnt
help
myself
i
really
enjoyed
this
beer
a
lot
another
one
on
the
top
list
i
was
glad
to
get
my
hands
on
drinkability
is
quite
good
for
the
abv
a
good
all
night
sipper
that
goes
down
easier
than
it
should
overall
this
a
fantastic
beer
i
can
see
why
it
gets
so
much
praise
like
liquid
big
boy
candy
poured
a
dark
brown
color
with
a
nice
head
the
smell
of
raisins
instantly
hits
my
nose
nice
slight
nutty
flavor
on
the
first
taste
can
taste
the
alchohol
in
the
mouthfeel
but
not
overwhelming
good
drinkability
all
around
definitely
good
on
a
cold
winter
night
could
drink
another
bottle
pours
cola
brown
with
heavy
turbidity
and
a
large
creamcolored
head
beautiful
and
very
inviting
aroma
jumps
right
out
of
the
glass
huge
complexity
here
but
i
am
clearly
getting
raisins
plum
cherry
amaretto
freshbaked
bread
and
a
hint
of
alcohol
flavor
is
complex
as
well
sweet
and
fruity
up
front
with
unripe
cherry
amaretto
and
caramel
malt
alcohol
is
definitely
noticeable
at
the
beginning
and
in
the
finish
but
not
offensive
and
gives
an
immediate
warming
feeling
that
is
quite
pleasant
im
not
a
big
fan
of
alcohol
flavor
but
this
is
quite
enjoyable
carbonation
is
high
tickling
the
tongue
and
body
is
medium
overall
a
delicious
beer
i
would
have
several
if
not
for
the
high
abv
drinkability
a
nice
flavor
profile
combined
with
an
outofthisworld
texture
make
this
a
deceptively
drinkable
beer
despite
its
incredible
abv
i
enjoy
it
quite
a
lot
o
excellent
drinkability
a
belgian
quad
masterpiece
somewhat
light
bodied
for
how
big
this
beer
is
not
sure
if
this
is
what
i
pictured
the
cousin
of
the
best
beer
in
the
world

sometimes

always
a
very
special
brew
to
indulge
in
a
classic
quad
sweet
delicious
beer
mouth
has
just
the
right
amount
of
carbonation
and
alcohol
is
slowly
warming
not
too
hot
considering
the
abv
this
is
up
there
with
the
bests
cheers
wonderful
beer
d
really
should
be
a
sipping
beer
but
i
find
no
need
to
be
reserved
about
quaffing
it
i
dont
think
its
as
interesting
complex
as
some
here
so
its
not
about
to
become
an
everyday
thing
but
definitely
a
solid
belgian
d
abv
doesnt
quite
scare
me
away
especially
when
taking
delightful
little
sips
this
was
the
first
belgian
quad
i
tried
so
there
is
a
soft
spot
for
it
a
spot
it
deserves
a
big
old
beer
makes
it
a
sipper
exemplifies
the
style
very
well
but
i
cant
say
theres
anything
here
to
wow
me
about
it
granted
its
going
to
be
pretty
great
but
i
didnt
find
any
je
ne
sais
quois
to
push
it
over
the
top
d
this
is
one
to
take
slow
and
appreciate
both
due
to
its
interesting
flavors
and
high
abv
its
definitely
not
difficult
to
drink
however
f
finishes
with
a
slight
sweetness
but
seems
to
dry
off
pretty
well
considering
all
the
age
its
had
a
slight
alcohol
warmth
and
sting
singes
for
a
bit
then
disappears
enough
to
let
you
get
more
of
the
raisin
cinnamon
candi
sugar
molasses
and
delicious
other
flavors
perhaps
if
anything
the
aging
has
formed
a
little
too
much
carbonation
i
get
some
earthy
flavors
as
well
on
the
finish
mostly
i
think
a
product
of
the
yeast
turning
the
belgian
candi
sugar
into
the
ginourmous
alcohol
no
where
near
as
complex
as
i
expected
and
that
alcohol
needs
to
be
tamed
d
good
the
rich
malt
taste
and
the
delicious
mouthfeel
really
make
this
one
worth
it
overall
this
was
a
great
beer
and
i
would
diffidently
recommend
it
to
anyone
looking
for
a
great
beer
to
try
bottle
at
the
alex
p
keaton
in
london
ontario
poured
a
dark

huge
sediment
visible
almost
syrup
looking
nice

and
the
head
seems
to
form
rings
in
the
middle
of
the
body
very
distinct
perfect
aromas
are
black
licorice
rasins
and
prunes
saltiness
and
some
floral
spiceyness
taste
is
floral
spicy
rasins
and
prunes
sweet
an
salty

too
nice

is

bitter

aftertaste
too
great
example
of
the
style
watch
out
westy
overall
a
world
class
quad
i
tasted
this
back
to
back
to
a
rochefort
10
and
i
thought
this
beer
was
a
much
better
offering
as
it
provided
a
more
balanced
mouthfeel
great
great
beer
overall
a
great
example
of
this
style
and
one
of
my
personal
favorite
beers
highly
recommended
tastes
like
it
smells
and
it
got
smoother
as
it
settled
there
is
a
dry
finish
and
nice
balance
overall

the

multiple

in
a
subtle
and
complex
combination
improves
with
age
tasted
at
the
brewery
in
watou
ill
be
having
this
again
a
delicious
quad
that
is
a
great
introduction
to
this
style
of
beer
this
is
a
very
good
brew
its
a
beauty
and
smells
just
as
good
as
it
looks
it
seems
very
complex
in
the
flavors
and
feel
but
i
think
overall
i
will
certainly
partake
in
this
abby
again
beer
is
full
bodied
and
smooth
yeasty
flavor
tons
of
malt
some
sweetness
from
the
malt
alcohol
this
is
a
really
good
beer
it
is
not
as
good
as
i
remember
though
i
feel
like
ive
had
better
quads
to
date
i
will
try
it
again
and
review
it
again
in
the
future
even
though
im
giving
it
a
good
review
now
it
didnt
live
up
to
my
memory
originally
reviewed
on
october
24
2009
i
wanted
like
this
beer
more
than
i
did
but
i
have
to
say
i
was
a
little
mixed
on
it
good
color
and
good
dark
fruit
flavor
and
aroma
but
in
general
it
wasnt
a
stand
out
quad
that
i
wanted
it
to
be
a
very
dark
brown
decent
carbonation
but
not
as
good
as
i
wanted
it
to
be
dexcellent
true
to
style
example
juicy
dark
fruit
and
a
building
dryness
leads
to
deliciousness

this
one

you
want
to
last
so
complex
but
with
such
a
light
body
that
i
could
sip
it
all
night
rich
but
not
cloying
theres
something
about
a
beer
like
this
that
makes
them
come
out
almost
as
perfection
in
a

everything
is
at
its

and

its
not

by
any

it
just
didnt
do
much
for
me
ill
not

will

oelergud
i
could
drink
this
all
night
if
not
for
the
high
potency
im
afraid
this
one
could
definitely
get
the
better
of
me
it
is
too
easy
to
drink
and
too
desirable
concidering
the
deep
complexity
of
this
beer
it
is
amazing
how
smooth
it
actually
is
also
concidering
it
costs
about
half
of
a
westy
or
rochefort
it
seems
like
a
great
deal
in
all
reality
epic
is
the
only
word
that
exists
in
the
same
realm
as
this
ale
so
i
will
leave
it
at
that
malt
flavor
and
dark
color
beautiful
aroma
the
best
belgian
quad
that
i
have
ever
had
tastes
a
little
better
in
the
750ml
cork
bottle
over
the
11
2oz
bottle
a
nice
winter
warmer
i
prefer
abt
12
over
rochfort
10
any
day
i
like
to
pair
this
brew
with
some
strongly
aged
abby
cheese
can
drink
this
at
any
time
of
year
also
this
is
one
of
the
most
pleasing
beers
ive
ever
had
id
like
to
face
this
one
off
against
the
trappistes
rochefort
10
and
see
which
one
i
truly
prefer
both
are
fantastic
the
only
thing
that
keeps
this
from
being
a
5
0
on
the
drinkability
scale
is
its
deceptivly
high
abv
overall
a
bit
of
a
disappointment
i
let
this
sit
for
about
1520
minutes
before
starting
but
it
was
still
a
bit
harsh
at
the
beginning
as
it
warmed
it
became
much
better
you
can
definitely
tell
all
of
this
breweries
beers
are
related
decent
stuff
but
not
all
that
in
my
book
this
beer
is
made
to
savor
with
its
abv
and
its
pricetoquantity
ratio
considered
but
can
be
drunken
at
a
steady
pace
if
you
really
wanted
to
my
advice
is
enjoy
it
slowly
d
given
the
abv
this
is
very
drinkable
an
excellent
beer
poured
out
of
the
corked
and
caged
750ml
bottle
into
a
tulip
poured
a
dark
brown
with
a
nice
thick
head
wonderful
head
retention
and
lacing
throughout
the
duration
of
the
beer
the
smell
is
more
complex
than
my
brain
can
process
i
pick
up
many
fruits
plum
cherries
banana
and
even
apples
along
with
a
nice
malt
and
yeast
aroma
the
high
abv
sneaks
into
the
nose
as
well
but
is
not
overpowering
mouthfeel
is
smooth
and
creamy
with
just
the
right
amount
of
carbonation
taste
is
extremely
complex
some
sips
i
will
get
a
delicate
combination
of
fruit
while
others
i
will
get
a
darker
maltchocolate
taste
these
tastes
are
followed
up
by
a
large
alcohol
kick
this
brew
gets
better
and
better
as
it
warms
up
and
even
more
of
the
flavors
come
out
overall
this
is
hands
down
one
of
the
finest
brews
in
the
world
i
had
this
in
bottle
many
years
agoand
enjoyed
it
on
tap
it
is
near
perfection
my
guess
is
that
the
monks
dont
care
about
being
celibate
after
a
few
of
these
this
is
one
of
the
very
few
that
livedd
up
to
the
hype
it
is
excellently
crafted
and
should
be
tried
by

of

i

a

fruit
flavors
a
bit
very
warming
at
10
finishes
off
sweet
and
semi
dry
awsome
abbey
ale
overall
a
really
fantastic
beer
easily
one
of
the
best
ive
had
33
cl
crowned
bottle
best
before
end
15
09
09
relatively
young
i
imagine
poured
into
an
oversized
wine
goblet
densely
clouded
blood
red
with
a
thinning
and
finely
attenuated
light
tan
layer
of
foam
nose
is
predominantly
portlike
with
notes
of
alcohol
heat
maraschino
cherries
and
yeasted
sugar
candies
the
highly
noticeable
booziness
of
the
aroma
is
stunningly
masked
in
the
flavor
all
i
get
are
dark
rumsoaked
plums
bing
cherries
and
a
slightly
soured
date
sugar
sweetness
at
the
finish
hearty
yeastflavored
aftertaste
the
alcohol
is
slightly
noticeable
immediately
before
the
finish
in
the
form
of
a
langorous
warming
at
the
back
of
the
throat
mouth
feel
is
chewy
and
expansive
airy
and
fluffy
with
a
rapid
yet
subtle
carbonated
effect
without
a
doubt
ridiculously
drinkable
for
10
abv
as
expected
pure
class
in
a
bottle
recommended
for
sure
uf
overall
impression
certainly
a
good
beer
and
enjoyable
enough
but
not
sure
that
i
would
put
it
in
the
outstanding
category
i
enjoyed
the
abt
8
much
more
this
seems
a
touch
unbalanced
with
the
alcohol
taking
too
much
presence
the
bottle
suggests
aging
and
id
be
inclined
to
agree
with
them
put
this
back
a
few
years
and
i
could
see
this
as
outstanding
recommended
i
cant
really
say
that
this
beer
lives
up
too
the
reputation
for
me
it
is
too
acidic
and
too
strong
to
really
enjoy
the
beer
quads
have
never
been
a
style
to
make
me
cross
the
street
but
id
crawl
naked
over
two
miles
of
broken
glass
just
to
get
my
hands
on
another
bottle
of
this
overall
a
fantastic
quadrupel
well
representative
of
the
style
enthusiastically
recommended
if
you
can
find
it
i
really
like
the
brewery
and
this
beverage
i
guess
i
took
a
chance
on
aging
it
in
some
subideal
conditions
and
it
didnt
work
out
ill
have
to
do
another
review
with
a
fresh
bottle
and
note
the
differences
the
pater
6
and
tripel
are
much
better
i
think
and
they
were
aged
side
by
side
for
almost
the
same
amount
of
time
so
i
dont
feel
the
bottle
should
be
spoiled
i
poured
this
beer
into
a
big
wine
glass
the
color
was
deep
amber
with
hints
of
red
and
a
big
light
off
white
head
i
get
alot
more
phenol
than
esters
in
the
smell
peppery
is
the
dominant
smell
with
some
plum
in
the
background
the
taste
starts
out
peppery
then
hint
of
orange
and
plum
that
give
way
to
a
malt
bready
type
ending
the
flavors
are
all
mixed
in
after
each
sip
the
peppery
taste
may
not
be
first
but
it
is
there
as
is
the
fruit
and
malt
it
is
highly
carbonated
and
has
a
medium
mouthfeel
the
carbonation
seems
to
help
mix
all
the
flavors
around
i
hope
i
can
get
more
of
this
soon
enjoy
and
be
careful
this
ale
packs
a
wallop
wow
this
is
a
very
nice
experience
it
pours
from
the
bottle
a
cloudy
dark
color
there
is
plenty
of
head
the
smell
is
malty
fainlty
of
citrus
and
with
only
hints
of
the
alcohol
content
within
the
taste
is
a
nice
malty
slap
to
the
palate
the
after
taste
is
nice
with
just
a
bit
of
stick
residue
on
the
glossal
apparatus
this
is
a
very
very
drinkable
beverage
while
the
high
abv
content
may
prevent
over
indulgence
on
tap
at
monks
in
the
back
bar
what
a
great
looking
beer
it
pours
a
nice
deep
brown
almost
black
body
with
a
thick
offwhite
and
creamy
head
the
aroma
is
a
good
balance
of
deep
toasted
notes
and
some
dried
fruit
tones
as
well
the
taste
is
a
feast
for
the
mouth
i
get
dried
fruits
plums
and
berries
i
also
get
an
obvious
toasted
character
to
this
bold
and
complex
and
full
bodied
beer
what
a
joy
to
consume
a
strong
dark
belgian
is
it
a
quad
or
just
a
abbey
dubble
with
lots
of
power
malty
and
worth
the
search
from
the
bottle
as
sampled
at
ommegang
beer
festival
the
mouthfeel
and
aroma
of
sweet
bread
along
put
this
beer
over
the
top
savor
slowly
as
it
does
creep
up
on
you
with
the
potent
alcohol
content
pours
dark
brown
with
a
big
creamy
offwhite
head
mostly
lasting
nice
lacing
aroma
is
clove
plums
banana
and
sweet
malt
flavor
is
caramel
toffee
plums
raisins
figs
and
spice
these
all
come
together
superbly
the
mouthfeel
of
this
is
wonderful
very
smooth
carbonation
dances
on
the
tongue
long
finish
slightly
warming
but
alcohol
is
amazingly
hidden
fantastic
im
going
on
memory
of
a
few
months
ago
a
delightful
pair
brought
me
two
bottles
back
from
their
monastic
tour
in
belgium
i
dont
recall
the
dateif
there
was
one
but
i
imagine
it
was
fairly
fresh
the
first
bottle
poured
wonderfully
toffee
brown
with
a
semisweet
very
malty
backbone
black
pepper
dominated
the
spices
the
other
bottle
has
been
cellared
for
a
while
now
i
beleive
ill
try
it
tonight
with
dinner
report
very
soon
with
notes
perhaps
i
caught
this
beer
at
an
unfortunate
point
of
age
as
it
stands
now
i
will
never
age
this
one
again
and
i
promise
to
drink
it
by
the
chalice
fresh
and
unwithered
had
this
on
tap
a
bit
ago
this
review
however
is
a
bottle
to
be
honest
i
would
much
rather
the
tap
the
bottle
is
nearly
the
same
with
the
exception
of
a
bit
more
carbonation
the
st
bernie
on
tap
had
a
softer
mouthfeel
i
also
think
that
the
smell
suffers
a
bit
in
the
bottle
however
this
is
still
a
very
good
beer
dried
fruits
and
vanilla
are
present
in
the
nose
and
the
taste
the
head
on
the
bottle
version
is
a
tad
more
than
that
on
tap
but
both
lace
the
chalice
tremendously
till
the
very
end
the
taste
finishes
on
the
dry
side
and
the
acholol
is
present
on
each
sip
but
that
doesnt
shy
me
away
from
this
one
as
usual
the
belgian
pride
shows
through
absolutely
worth
the
effort
put
forth
in
searching
this
one
out
this
is
a
beer
to
buy
and
savor
again
and
again
thank
god
bottleworks
carries
this
regularly
i
will
kill
err
buy
again
drinkability
well
this
is
only
a
330cl
but
im
splitting
it
with
a
friend
i
would
not
be
able
to
take
down
more
than
one
of
these
smaller
bottles
11
2
oz
bottle
with
the
numbers
260710
on
the
label
cloudy
muddy
light
brown
color
thick
offwhite
head
which
disappeared
quickly
leaving
a
thin
ring
around
the
edges
of
the
goblet
aroma
of
plums
raisins
figs
dark
bread
and
alcohol
quite
a
pleasant
combination
for
the
old
sniffer
warming
with
alcohol
lots
of
carbonation
dark
fruity
and
breadlike
with
some
spices
and
yeasty
flavor
heavy
in
aroma
and
flavor
but
doesnt
overwhelm
the
palate
due
to
the
carbonation
very
well
done
a
delight
warming
and
full
of
flavor
while
it
provides
warmth
the
drying
carbonation
prevents
cloying
and
makes
this
an
easy
drinking
high
alcohol
beer
the
nose
is
very
fruity
and
malty
a
little
dissapointing
as
far
as
the
flavor
went
i
picked
up
on
malts
fruitscitrus
nuts
alchol
and
hot
cinnamon
flaovr
the
beer
is
full
bodied
and
leaves
your
mouth
with
a
buttery
lard
feeling
after
drinking
the
alchol
is
present
to
say
the
least
and
it
warms
your
whole
body
up
i
enjoyed
this
beer
alot
two
thumbs
way
up
pretty
high
abv
but
an
absolutely
delicious
experience
reminded
me
of
trappistes
rochefort
10
and
also
gulden
draak
and
nostradamus
so
it
sits
in
exalted
company
but
we
should
expect
that
from
the
st
bernardus
brewery
by
now
this
beer
is
great
is
it
one
of
the
best
in
the
world
most
certainly
in
my
book
absolutely
worth
the
six
dollars
per
glass
at
the
saucer
both
times
not
a
horribly
complex
beer
but
great
overall
one
of
the
best
worthy
ut
vivat
crescat
floreat
this
is
a
wonderful
sipper
the
high
abv
and
intense
flavors
make
one
brew
enough
for
me
but
drinkability
still
has
to
be
rated
very
high
drinkability
of
this
high
abv
is
great
it
took
about
30
minutes
to
finish
off
the
bottle
this
beer
will
become
one
of
my
cellar
favorites
picked
up
the
750ml
corked
bottle
from
beers
of
the
world
and
was
excited
the
whole
way
home
served
just
under
room
temp
into
a
tulip
glass
upon
pouring
a
large
brown
head
appeared
and
remained
untill
the
glass
was
finished
this
beer
has
the
most
beautiful
color
when
held
up
to
the
light
a
deep
red
that
is
alittle
clouded
by
yeast
the
smell
is
also
incredible
very
floral
aroma
that
in
overwhelmingly
enjoyable
the
aroma
of
this
beer
definitely
got
you
ready
for
the
taste
the
taste
is
amazing
sweet
but
not
heavy
dry
but
not
too
dry
this
beer
suprises
you
with
every
sip
you
take
i
babied
this
bottle
for
almost
an
hour
because
i
didnt
want
it
to
end
it
is
smooth
and
clean
in
the
mouth
and
i
could
drink
this
beer
for
the
rest
of
my
life
if
i
could
afford
to
definitely
deserves
to
be
in
the
top
five
in
ba
dhonestly
i
tried
this
due
to
the
high
ranking
and
i
agree
it
is
wonderful
one
is
plenty
due
to
the
10
abv
and
bold
flavors
but
a
great
sipping
beer
the
perfect
nightcap
imo
d
the
alcohol
in
this
makes
it
hard
for
me
to
drink
more
than
a
few
of
these
it
was
served
to
me
a
bit
too
cold
but
it
really
opened
up
as
it
went
up
a
few
degrees
side
note
i
definately
feel
this
one
is
best
when
it
warms
i
opened
it
when
it
was
still
a
little
too
cool
and
as
it
warmed
in
front
of
me
it
kept
getting
better
overall
this
is
a
brilliant
brew
especially
as
a
winter
warmer
and
will
not
disappoint
i
will
be
back
for
more
i
usually
drink
this
beer
whenever
i
go
to
the
publick
house
but
this
one
is
a
1
pint
9
4
ounce
bottle
from
julios
it
poured
a
cloudy
hazy
brown
with
a
creamy
head
that
lasts
forever
the
lacing
is
great
the
aroma
is
of
fruits
raisins
malts
and
alcohol
this
beer
has
such
a
complex
taste
it
is
wonderful
and
delicious
the
mouthfeel
is
smooth
and
creamy
this
is
definitely
not
a
chugging
beer
it
is
great
to
sip
and
sip
i
will
all
night
until
the
very
last
drop
of
this
beauty
mouthfeel
smothe
silkey
but
finishes
crisp
this
is
a
beer
to
sip
by
a
fire
and
in
the
company
of
good
friends
a
beer
to
harmonize
with
a
situation
of
rich
beauty
and
languor
drinkability
unbelieveable
incredible
especially
considering
its
10
alcohol
mouthfeel
is
the
best
ive
had
tastes
amazing
through
a
range
of
temperatures
great
alone
or
with
food
i
intend
to
keep
some
of
this
around
whenever
i
can
is
perfect
in
nice
5
oz
servings
taste
never
falters
could
sip
it
all
day
despite
its
abv
jim
pours
a
dark
brown
translucent
color
has
a
thick
off
white
head
that
fell
to
a
14
inch
cap
with
lacings
along
the
side
aroma
was
grainy
and
sweet
malts
fruity
like
figs
or
raisins
with
earthy
and
spicy
undertones
taste
was
just
as
expected
with
fruity
raisins
and
figs
had
a
very
refreshing
fruitiness
but
with
just
the
right
amount
of
hops
to
smooth
down
the
sweetness
and
finish
with
mellow
cloves
and
spices
has
a
earthy
oaken
undertone
carbonation
is
medium
with
medium
body
it
has
a
lot
of
flavor
that
lasts
for
a
while
but
with
a
refreshing
mouthfeel
alcohol
is
mostly
hidden
but
still
has
a
good
warming
effect
wonderful
beer
that
will
be
around
for
evenings
to
sit
and
chat
drinkability
this
does
not
comes
across
like
10
what
a
great
beer
ill
have
to
grab
more
at
my
next
opportunity
wish
i
could
drink
it
every
day
this
brew
poured
a
very
dark
brown
color
with
a
dense
head
that
stuck
to
the
side
of
the
glass
the
beer
was
so
dark
in
fact
that
i
could
not
shine
a
light
through
it
the
nose
was
spicy
malty
and
chocolatey
the
taste
was
impressive
with
notes
of
dark
fruit
chocolate
port
wine
and
molasses
in
the
palate
this
beer
was
very
rich
and
luscious
alcohol
was
noticable
but
hidden
quite
well
st
bernardus
12
deserves
it
high
rating
on
the
best
of
ba
excellent
beer
this
beer
is
hyped
as
being
superior
to
westy
12
ummm
not
sure
i
see
why
that
claim
holds
so
well
all
the
flavors
just
seem
a
bit
more
subdued
than
westy
12
malts
are
candy
sweet
with
some
tired
belgian
sugars
spice
flavors
were
present
but
they
seemed
like
they
were
out
of
date
too
phenols
were
a
bit
strong
especially
as
the
beer
warmed
more
little
bits
of
cherry
too
full
body
and
flavor
allinall
it
is
a
drinkable
belgian
but
not
sure
it
is
what
everyone
pumps
it
up
to
be
poured
out
of
a
bottle
into
a
tulip
glass
nice
dark
color
with
medium
head
that
sticks
to
everything
it
touches
nice
lacing
all
around
smells
fantastic
lots
a
malted
bitter
fruits
with
a
hint
of
alcohol
taste
is
great
as
well
fruits
and
sweet
malts
dominate
like
a
belgian
beer
should
mouth
is
full
bodied
with
a
decent
amount
of
carbonation
very
good
drinkability
is
hurt
a
little
by
the
abv
but
i
would
happily
down
these
until
i
couldnt
stand
d
storng
abv
makes
this
one
a
beer
to
cherish
nice
to
sip
and
enjoy
the
beers
flavor
was
big
and
comlex
like
its
aroma
with
a
malt
presence
at
the
beginning
along
with
overt
hints
of
different
dark
fruits
a
subdued
hop
presence
and
a
completely
hidden
abv
although
thils
beers
creaminess
points
it
towards
the
sipping
category
it
can
sneak
up
on
you
while
being
incredibly
drinkable
plunk
me
down
with
some
good
music
and
a
few
good
friends
and
an
evening
of
discussing
this
beer
and
whatever
else
come
our
way
while
other
belgian
beers
maybe
more
rare
st
bernardus
is
generally
readily
available
and
well
worth
purchasing
again
because
of
its
exceptional
quality
not
my
favourite
but
i
must
give
respect
a
great
great
beer
7
99750ml
this
is
a
steal
mouthfeel
is
smooth
creamy
sugary
and
full
of
doughy
yeast
and
rich
malt
this
is
one
of
the
first
belgians
ive
hadd
out
of
many
which
tempts
me
to
have
a
second
glass
immediately
after
the
first
normally
i
have
to
take
a
break
with
something
less
complex
or
less
alcoholic
but
this
is
really
relaly
good
rich
full
mouthfeel
the
alcohol
burn
keeps
this
from
being
incredible
abv
keeps
drinkability
from
being
as
high
as
the
other
scores
for
drinakbility
ill
take
the
6
or
8
both
wonderful
beers
in
themselves
drinkability
this
beer
feels
like
a
lighter
belgian
beer
to
the
palate
even
though
it
is
not
its
quite
drinkable
but
i
dont
think
id
want
to
stick
with
this
single
style
all
night
d
i
tried
this
once
before
and
didnt
care
for
it
much
but
i
bought
it
again
hoping
that
i
got
a
bad
bottle
nope
ive
enjoyed
every
other
belgian
that
ive
had
so
im
a
little
perplexed
as
to
why
this
one
tastes
so
different
to
me
a
positive
is
that
the
alcohol
is
very
well
hidden
but
for
the
price
i
dont
think
that
this
is
worth
buying
again
this
is
one
of
those
beers
you
want
to
continuously
sip
over
an
evening
lots
of
stuff
going
on
here
which
means
itll
hold
your
interest
wonderful
this
is
a
tasty
belgian
brew
some
people
might
not
care
for
the
alcohol
bite
notes
a
very
good
beer
i
have
had
some
quads
that
have
overwhelmed
me
with
a
strong
alcohol
presence
not
this
one
this
quad
is
well
crafted
and
a
pleasure
to
drink
at
13
95
for
a
four
pack
it
s
hard
to
justify
the
price
outside
having
some
friends
come
into
town
but
well
worth
grabbing
if
you
havent
tried
it
before
hazy
brown
drink
with
carbonation
bubbles
rising
the
entire
time
very
large
offwhite
head
that
stays
throughout
the
drink
tons
of
lacing
nose
of
sweet
ripened
fruit
yeast
and
clove
cigarettes
very
sweet
smell
more
clove
in
the
taste
along
with
afore
mentioned
sweet
fruit
and
strong
alcohol
taste
that
is
present
but
not
overpowering
and
that
doesnt
take
away
from
the
rest
of
the
flavors
as
soon
as
you
swallow
the
wave
of
warm
strong
alcohol
taste
and
feel
hit
hard
its
not
a
bad
thing
at
all
mmm
that
feels
good
creamy
feel
to
this
beer
with
a
smooth
but
strong
finish
im
not
sure
i
could
have
more
than
one
or
two
of
these
in
a
night
simply
because
of
the
alcohol
content
if
i
could
i
would
though
great
beer
go
pick
this
one
up
d
certainly
a
sipper
and
one
to
enjoy
alcohol
makes
its
presence
felt
after
a
bottle
but
not
overpoweringly
so
but
hey
thats
part
of
the
fun
of
drinking
isnt
it
the
bottle
kicks
ass
the
label
is
screenprinted
on
showing
a
happy
monk
dude
i
popped
this
one
open
causing
a
loud
explosion
lots
of
pressure
i
guess
this
poured
a
gorgous
hazy
burgundian
brown
with
a
nice
creamy
tan
head
the
head
looks
like
a
root
beer
float
lots
of
craters
and
variation
in
bubble
size
kinda
cool
good
lacing
the
aroma
is
fruity
wlight
alcohol
presence
the
flavor
is
tangy
and
yeasty
this
beer
does
kick
your
ass
via
alcohol
but
it
lacks
the
flavor
that
i
would
think
it
would
need
to
have
to
justify
the
stellar
rankings
it
has
gotten
the
mouthfeel
is
pretty
great
though
very
smooth
moderately
drinkable
drinkability

definitely
a
sipping
beer
this
one
is
powerful
in
every
way
but
still
makes
you
want
more
mouthfeel
is
smooth
fullbodied
near
syrupy
borderline
cloying
which
definitely
hurts
its
drinkability
is
this
a
good
belgian
ale
yes
is
this
a
westvleteren
12
clone
as
popularly
believed
hardly
is
this
deserving
of
such
a
high
ranking
here
i
dont
think
so
drinkable
but
still
just
a
halfhearted
effort
verdict
this
isnt
a
beer
its
an
experience
the
alcohol
is
slightly
high
for
my
personal
taste
but
is
balanced
by
the
fantastic
malt
character
like
many
strong
belgian
ales
this
beer
is
will
hopped
to
balance
the
heavy
malt
perhaps
the
most
drinkable
10
brew
i
have
ever
tasted
while
the
alcohol
is
noticeable
it
only
serves
to
add
to
the
experience
unlike
many
imperial
stouts
there
is
not
a
significant
amount
of
thickness
to
the
liquid
to
impair
drinkability
all
in
all
a
experience
an
absolutely
amazing
beer
and
heres
the
kicker
im
not
even
particularly
fond
of
belgians
simply
one
of
my
favorite
beers
ive
heard
a
rumor
that
st
bernardus
brews
recipes
that
were
sold
to
them
from
westvleteren
and
not
having
tasted
them
i
could
believe
it
this
beer
is
flat
out
phenomenal
if
i
could
change
anything
about
it
i
wouldnt
pours
a
creamy
brown
with
a
nice
lingering
head
smell
is
malty
and
sweet
with
some
slight
funkiness
and
a
decent
amount
of
alcohol
coming
through
taste
is
fairly
full
bodied
for
a
belgian
with
malty
richness
and
suggestions
of
plums
mouthfeel
is
very
nice
not
too
much
carbonation
and
enough
body
to
make
this
a
great
sipper
alcohol
comes
through
in
a
peppery
finish
which
makes
this
a
beer
to
respect
just
one
bottle
and
i
can
definitely
feel
this
one
overall
a
really
world
class
brew
definitely
one
that
is
worthy
of
its
reputation
d
a
very
drinkable
brew
i
am
exceedingly
partial
to
belgian
ales
and
this
one
is
impressive
750ml
silkcreened
corked
bottle
pours
a
mahogony
brown
with
a
1
finger
head
ok
longevity
and
good
lace
deep
caramel
and
sugar
aromas
with
dried
dark
fruit
slight
hop
spicy
aromas
deep
caramel
and
brown
sugar
taste
but
with
a
touch
of
roasted
malt
and
drited
dark
fruit
flavors
decent
hop
flavors
and
bitterness
but
fades
quickly
into
a
alcohol
presence
carbonation
is
a
bit
high
which
reduces
the
drinkability
a
decent
quad
that
im
sure
will
be
much
better
with
a
year
in
the
cellar
i
think
i
will
buy
another
and
try
the
head
is
a
half
inch
thick
its
tan
looking
and
almost
appears
gray
also
it
dissipates
pretty
fast
though
the
color
is
a
deep
plum
and
there
is
lots
of
floating
sediment
throughout
the
smell
is
fruity
with
aromas
of
rasins
and
bananas
spice
and
alcohol
the
taste
is
sweet
initially
then
becomes
a
little
more
tart
after
a
few
seconds
with
more
rasiny
fruit
notes
the
malt
flavor
is
complex
and
it
tastes
dry
the
finish
is
not
bitter
but
somewhat
spicy
and
with
moderate
alcohol
flavor
the
mouthfeel
is
excellent
zesty
bubbles
not
overly
thick
incredibly
smooth
a
solid
quadrupel
many
will
love
it
overall
just
one
of
the
finest
beers
around
i
could
have
this
all
day
long
well
until
i
pass
out
and
not
get
tire
of
the
complexities
however
i
dont
feel
this
bottle
represents
what
i
have
had
before
or
maybe
its
just
me
tonight
great
stuff
nice
big
body
on
this
one
and
great
drinkability
i
think
i
could
have
about
3
of
these
and
feel
alright
nice
beer
wow
this
is
my
second
time
having
this
beer
and
it
was
just
as
i
remembered
so
delicious
so
smooth
this
quad
pours
a
dark
ruby
brown
and
leaves
a
thin
tan
lace
that
sticks
to
the
glass
and
stays
with
the
brew
the
aromas
is
fruity
esters
alcohal
soaked
dark
fruit
caramel
brown
sugar
very
complex
and
literally
makes
you
salivate
the
taste
is
so
complex
it
starts
dry
and
tangy
with
a
slight
vinos
presence
but
more
actually
to
rum
or
brandy
it
then
sweetens
on
your
palate
with
a
carmal
malt
feeling
that
then
again
brings
you
to
more
of
a
dark
plum
feel
on
the
palate
fantastic
brew
i
would
pair
this
beer
with
a
fresh
fruit
plate
to
compliment
the
fruit
in
the
beer
good
looking
beer
pours
like
brandy
almost
but
with
some
small
head
looks
sticky
and
reddish
brown
smells
like
alcohol
at
first
then
kind
of
like
corny
malt
liquorish
first
couple
of
sips
burn
with
the
alcohol
and
you
feel
it
diffuse
into
your
tongue
then
there
was
a
fairly
complex
mishmash
of
flavors
including
prunes
malt
notquiteripe
apples
and
ethanol
i
didnt
actually
think
this
lived
up
to
its
hype
very
well
too
harsh
and
more
than
one
would
knock
me
on
my
ass
maybe
it
would
be
better
cellared
for
a
while
but
im
not
sure
im
going
to
give
it
that
chance
drinkability
is
okay
the
buring
alcohol
is
wearing
me
down
as
drink
this
but
the
smell
is
so
fantastic
i
just
want
more
it
looks
so
good
in
the
glass
i
want
another
sip
yet
each
sip
brings
the
burning
edge
of
alcohol
its
so
sad
and
yet
so
wonderful

this
is
an

one
of

rivalling
anything
produced
by
any

well
done
st

is
very

it
about
halfway
through

sugary

incredibly
drinkable
great

taste
presents

that
caresses
the

in
an
extraordinary
manner
finish
is
very
smooth
for
a
10
alcohol
beer
drinkabilty
is
scary
because
this
beer
is
so
easy
going
down
a
great
beer
supper
smooth
going
down
for
a
10
beer
it
is
incredible
drinkable
this
is
damn
near
perfect
slight
knock
on
appearance
for
head
retention
time
im
still
searching
for
that
perfect
beer
but
this
is
as
close
as
ive
come
aroma
is
quite
fruity
with
notes
of
sfruit
piced
cake
and
spices
dark
brown
but
very
slightly
reddish
color
head
is
two
and
half
fingers
lasting
and
mostly
creamy
though
there
are
some
bubbles
fore
is
again
quite
fruity
with
pear
apple
cherry
and
plum
coming
out
there
is
a
very
bready
malt
feel
to
it
and
some
candy
sugar
sweetness
almost
tastes
like
a
spiced
apple
liqour
it
does
lack
in
some
areas
the
flavor
intensity
isnt
quit
as
strong
as
id
like
you
can
pick
out
quite
a
bit
but
it
doesnt
dazzle
the
palate
as
much
as
some
others
appears
very
dark
brown
in
colour
with
a
stable
medium
sized
light
brown
head
aroma
of
sweet
chocolatey
malts
brown
sugar
and
hints
of
spices
and
fruits
oranges
rich
chocolatey
nutty
malt
flavour
some
brown
sugar
dried
fruit
raisins
and
spices
are
suggested
too
some
warming
alcohol
in
the
finish
but
no
burn
mouthfeel
is
full
and
coarse
tasty
satisfying
and
a
little
easier
to
drink
than
rochefort
10
although
possibly
not
as
complex
all
in
all
outstanding
poured
into
a
rapscallion
glass
formed
a
1
34
light
tan
head
above
the
clear
reddish
burgundy
brew
pillowy
head
lasts
and
lasts
with
heavy
airy
lacing
aroma
is
sweet
dark
fruit
and
spices
coupling
with
the
malty
sweetness
taste
is
really
exactly
as
the
nose
indicated
with
a
warming
alcohol
close
mouthfeel
is
smooth
and
drinkability
is
nice
although
the
sweetness
and
alcohol
starts
to
limit
sessions
very
nice
brew
for
sure
d
going
to
keep
a
few
of
these
in
my
cellar
definitely
one
of
my
new
favourites
i
always
equate
this
beer
with
the
westvleterin
12
mostly
because
not
a
lot
of
belgian
companies
make
the
quadrupel
style
this
is
a
terrific
beer
but
it
just
doesnt
have
the
same
complexities
that
are
found
in
the
westy
a
very
similar
candied
fruit
taste
dominates
the
front
and
end
of
the
beer
while
an
overwhelming
popuri
fills
the
middle
definitly
not
a
beer
that
can
be
drank
fast
with
a
content
of
10
but
i
still
think
the
ultimate
is
westy
i
could
enjoy
another
more
than
two
would
be
a
lot
smoother
than
silk
peppy
on
the
tongue
never
cloying
never
heavy
never
lightbodied
and
only
overpowering
in
the
same
way
horniness
is
overpowering
ya
dig
a
stupendous
beer
props
to
julierfoster
for
the
great
gift
came
with
3
other
st
bernardii
and
a
glass
the
winey
aftertaste
lingers
for
a
few
seconds
then
is
gone
mouthfeel
is
nothing
special
medium
bodied
for
the
style
very
carbonated
dry
very
drinkable
a
bit
overrated
in
my
opinion
but
a
good
beer
nonetheless
the
beer
pours
a
dark
amber
brown
with
a
huge
head
that
holds
fantastically
and
laces
great
it
smells
of
some
fruit
that
i
cannot
put
my
finger
on
it
definitely
does
not
smell
of
citrus
as
experienced
with
most
beers
there
might
also
be
a
faint
liquorice
smell
about
it
the
taste
is
quite
similar
to
the
smell
the
fruit
may
be
cherry
the
mouthfeel
is
thick
and
the
carbonation
is
even
it
feels
fantastic
overall
i
absolutely
love
this
beer
and
would
drink
it
again
and
again
i
look
forward
to
getting
chance
to
cellar
some
of
this
drinkability
this
isnt
really
my
favorite
style
so
i
wouldnt
drink
more
then
1
in
a
sitting
but
its
a
nice
change
from
the
regular
stuff
overall
not
a
good
one
here
too
much
alcohol
ruins
it
too
sweet
as
well
this
is
an
amazing
brew
overall
a
very
strong
beer
too
strong
to
contemplate
having
several
in
a
row
could
probably
use
a
year
or
two
in
the
cellar
look
forward
to
having
a
mellower
version
an
adult
beer
not
for
guzzlers
amateurs
hipsters
liars
slackjaws
hippies
rednecks
punks
grabasses
politicians
or
crybabies
grabs
you
by
the
shirt
and
demands
respect
the
worlds
finest
craftsmanship
its
not
often
you
can
appreciate
the
sweat
and
the
beauty
of
such
a
thing
at
the
same
time
if
i
find
a
better
beer
i
fear
i
shall
be
dead
this
is
the
pinnacle
the
absolute
tip
of
the
spire
amen
dtaking
notes
on
this
was
tough
as
all
i
wanted
to
do
was
sip
it
holding
the
glass
with
both
hands
pour
more
and
repeat
all
who
tried
it
on
xmas
day
agreed
it
was
different
complex
and
out
and
out
good
will
buy
another
750
or
two
next
time
i
am
at
the
store
kickass
warming
sensation
provided
by
the
10
so
sad
to
see
the
bottle
empty
tough
to
put
into
words
how
much
i
enjoyed
this
superb
is
the
first
thing
that
comes
to
mind
top
flight
beer
this
is
an
exceptional
brew
that
deserves
its
praise
a
fine
after
dinner
drink
to
enjoy
slowly
and
savor
all
the
complexities
this
brew
has
to
offer
rich
and
delicious
this
is
a
well
balanced
flavorful
beer
it
hides
the
10
alcohol
very
well
its
best
when
each
sip
is
savored
as
the
flavor
comes
alive
when
the
beer
warms
in
the
glass
i
can
honestly
say
this
is
one
of
the
first
quadrupels
that
ive
actually
sat
down
and
enjoyed
it
looked
beautiful
being
poured
into
my
snifter
with
a
monsterous
2
in
foaming
light
tan
head
it
has
a
light
brown
color
to
it
a
slightly
fruity
smell
with
a
little
hint
of
vanilla
this
is
probably
one
of
the
best
balanced
beers
that
ive
tasted
i
was
expecting
a
big
alcohol
kick
with
the
10
but
it
was
just
right
mixed
with
the
malts
pretty
much
perfect
i
can
sit
down
and
drink
a
few
of
these
i
might
not
feel
too
good
in
the
morning
but
i
wouldnt
mind
drinking
it
pours
a
garnet
hued
dull
brown
with
a
billowing
beige
head
rocky
all
over
diminishing
and
lacing
my
glass
to
death
aroma
is
intoxicating
nutty
almond
brown
sugar
soft
plum
faint
mint
clove
even
slight
banana
taste
is
immediately
almond
and
brown
sugar
then
theres
a
flood
of
esters
and
burly
molasses
drying
through
the
finish
leaving
my
palate
aching
in
its
wake
its
the
aroma
magnified
by
10
and
my
mouth
waters
spicy
alcohol
and
yeastiness
integrated
throughout
a
meaty
body
with
medium
carbonation
a
tad
abrasive
and
utter
perfection
i
need
more
this
is
right
on
style
aroma
is
light
bread
with
a
moderately
yeasty
smell
there
is
also
a
hint
of
cherry
i
think
the
draft
verion
which
i
had
two
night
ago
has
more
cherry
there
was
a
rocky
head
but
definitely
not
as
much
as
on
draft
not
a
whole
lot
of
head
but
it
doesnt
fully
diminish
initial
flavor
is
moderately
sweet
that
lessens
somewhat
more
cherry
and
bread
than
the
aroma
indicated
the
finish
is
long
this
was
lively
on
th
etongue
more
so
than
the
draft
version
there
is
a
moderate
alcohol
feel
while
this
is
one
of
my
favorite
quads
i
think
its
even
better
with
a
year
on
it
when
i
think
of
what
a
quad
should
be
like
i
think
of
abt
12
from
the
bottle
pored
brown
with
light
tan
head
some
real
nice
lacing
aroma
citrus
yeast
malts
chocolte
molasses
dark
cherries
and
other
dark
fruits
and
alcohol
flavor
wow
the
balance
of
chocolate
cherries
grape
and
malts
were
right
on
the
the
way
the
alcohol
came
out
was
nice
and
had
a
nice
dry
finish
notes
if
you
like
sweeter
beers
try
this
you
will
love
it
more
than
your
wife
overall
like
i
said
i
didnt
cream
my
slacks
over
it
but
wouldnr
exactly
turn
one
away
either
so
it
gets
great
marks
for
taste
and
drinkability
but
the
overall
depth
makes
it
miss
the
perfect
mark
i
must
be
a
sucker
for
a
less
polished
package
when
it
comes
to
the
filtering
and
flavor
profile
i
wouldnt
possbly
turn
one
down
however
pours
a
dark
ruby
with
a
thick
cocoatinged
head
that
eventually
dissipates
leaving
a
consistent
lacing
smells
wonderful
bready
yeasts
chocolaty
malts
and
spice
mmmm
taste
does
it
get
any
better
than
this
rumdrenched
raisins
and
good
dense
european
bread
brandy
and
sweet
cherries
strong
port
and
dark
chocolate
fantastic
great
carbonation
making
it
very
drinkable
for
the
abv
though
one
is
enough
thank
you
overall
you
cant
beat
this
one
with
a
stick
those
crazy
trappist
monks
know
what
theyre
doing
notes
honestly
this
beer
is
worth
the
13
50
for
4
12oz
bottles
would
make
the
purchase
again
in
a
hearbeat
feeling
that
the
only
way
this
beer
could
improve
would
be
to
enjoy
it
in
its
home
country
also
with
a
shelf
life
of
years
i
would
absolutly
love
to
let
one
of
these
age
would
suggest
following
serving
instructions
and
serving
this
beer
at
a
warmer
temperature
agitation
also
brings
out
hidden
complexities
that
may
not
be
at
first
noticed
i
was
really
stunned
by
the
alcohol
in
this
beer
it
was
prominent
but
not
at
all
overpowering
it
added
a
flavor
all
of
its
own
that
blended
in
well
with
the
rest
of
the
flavors
this
is
a
well
done
beer
notes
this
beer
experience
was
unique
st
bernardus
abt
12
has
the
power
to
relax
you
body
and
mind
after
only
about
half
a
beer
it
is
an
absolute
pleasure
to
partake
of
this
masterpiece
this
is
a
truly
great
beer
that
defines
the
style
pours
a
dark
brown
with
a
nice
head
there
are
smells
of
dark
sugary
fruit
bread
nuts
leather
the
mouthfeel
is
full
and
coats
the
tongue
with
fine
bubbles
and
deep
malt
texture
the
flavors
from
the
malts
and
yeast
dominate
bring
out
flavors
of
nuts
plums
figs
cherry
and
fresh
baked
bread
broad
yeast
profile
imparting
flavors
of
spice
nutmeg
vanilla
there
is
almost
no
hint
of
the
alcohol
in
this
beer
i
had
some
biting
pecorino
romano
cheese
that
really
set
off
the
flavors
of
this
beer
and
made
them
new
with
each
sip
buy
and
enjoy
this
beer
a
big
daddy
a
fireside
sipper
drinkability
is
above
average
for
this
huge
beer
i
could
sip
and
i
do
mean
sip
slowly
all
night
long
length
is
rather
remarkable
with
the
intensity
of
flavor
continuing
throughout
mouthfeel
is
nice
with
a
relatively
low
carbonation
letting
the
weight
of
the
malt
give
a
really
rounded
velvety
impression
sweetness
rounds
it
out
nicely
perilously
drinkable
for
what
it
is
and
a
favorite
of
the
style
for
me
overall
this
is
a
good
beer
as
some
of
buddys
took
sips
and
enjoyed
it
it
might
take
a
little
while
for
me
to
get
used
to
this
style
so
ill
try
some
more
quadrupels
in
the
future
i
highly
recommend
this
beer
especially
from
the
750ml
corked
and
caged
bottles
nice
screen
printing
on
the
bottles
too
and
it
sits
firmly
in
my
top
five
beers
list
dark
brown
in
colour
with
fairly
strong
carbonation
aromatic
notes
of
red
berries
caramel
malt
raisin
and
nutmeg
the
sweet
caramel
elements
become
more
eveident
in
the
flavor
along
with
additional
notes
of
very
mild
toasted
oak
vanilla
plums
and
other
dark
fruit
not
a
great
deal
of
alcohol
presence
complex
yet
easy
drinking
i
was
expecting
to
get
blown
away
by
this
beer
and
was
a
little
disappointed
that
i
wasnt
but
this
was
still
a
pretty
darn
good
drinkability
this
beer
is
just
fantastic
although
high
in
alcohol
it
does
not
interfere
with
the
taste
and
is
smooth
the
one
thing
that
struck
me
most
about
this
splendid
beer
was
its
maximal
smoothness
and
impressive
drinkability
i
did
not
find
it
to
be
particularly
complicated
or
interesting
and
yet
i
didnt
mind
this
in
the
slightest
st
bernies
12
just
tastes
so
good
that
i
dont
care
if
its
not
much
more
than
boat
loads
of
sweet
rich
malts
to
me
this
is
just
about
a
perfect
beer
it
is
meant
for
consumption
it
gives
a
great
buzz
it
is
strong
yet
excessively
drinkable
i
love
it
and
will
make
it
a
point
to
drink
it
en
mass
whenever
i
am
given
the
opportunity
what
can
i
say
about
this
one
thank
god
its
on
tap
at
the
publick
house
this
is
my
old
stand
by
there
and
you
really
cant
go
wrong
with
it
an
amazing
sweet
belgian
bruin
a
reminder
of
what
good
beer
is
all
about
i
will
be
seeing
this
beer
again
soon
this
brew
pours
a
dark
brown
color
with
a
medium
size
white
creamy
head
the
lacing
is
outstaning
the
aroma
is
of
spices
and
caramel
but
is
rather
faint
the
taste
is
nice
and
spicy
with
a
solid
malt
backbone
the
mouthfeel
is
meiumfull
bodied
with
nice
carbonation
overall
this
is
a
good
brew
worth
havin
again
my
expectations
on
st
bernardus
abt
12
were
high
to
say
the
least
i
overherad
some
guys
at
the
bar
saying
it
was
number
three
on
best
of
ba
respect
the
happy
monk
label
on
the
bottle
is
pretty
low
budget
but
the
beer
itself
is
straight
from
beershambala
it
poured
with
a
nice
dark
bluered
color
with
brownish
head
that
settled
down
to
a
finger
the
complex
flowery
smell
reminded
me
of
cheap
artificially
flavoured
soft
candy
the
taste
is
actually
a
lot
like
traditional
swedish
christmas
must
but
with
a
lot
more
alcohol
some
dry
hops
emerging
in
the
aftertaste
biting
the
cheeks
dont
try
to
drink
another
brand
during
the
same
session
this
beer
is
fantastic
certainly
deserving
of
the
praise
sung
by
other
bas
i
still
think
rochefort
10
is
my
favorite
but
this
one
makes
the
short
list
of
best
in
the
world
i
plan
to
come
back
to
it
shortly
the
taste
is
a
mix
of
fruit
more
of
the
plum
and
some
banana
with
a
faint
clove
presence
yum
this
is
wonderfully
balanced
brew
that
does
a
nice
job
of
warming
and
doesnt
let
the
alcohol
interfere
with
the
flavours
symphonic
melody
tis
a
fine
example
of
a
belgian
quadrupel
this
is
a
great
beer
full
of
complex
flavors
and
deceptively
smooth
for
10
percent
its
worth
a
try
world
class
but
still
no
westy
12
the
drinkability
level
is
beyond
good
not
to
mention
its
10
0
abv
each
gentle
sip
is
more
enjoyable
than
the
next
a
world
class
beer
and
clearly
recommended
i
have
had
this
on
tap
at
the
publick
house
in
brookline
ma
a
couple
of
times
and
this
beer
is
even
more
phenomenal
on
draft
one
the
best
beers
ive
had
anyways
thats
not
important
on
to
the
good
stuff
this
beer
is
nothing
short
of
majestic
always
touted
as
one
of
the
best
beers
in
the
world
and
now
i
believe
it
served
in
a
tulipstyle
glass
dark
brown
rich
ruby
color
with
a
very
large
frothy
immovable
head
yeasty
sediment
is
suspended
in
the
glass
and
the
lacing
forms
in
sheets
aroma
taste
are
huge
and
complex
big
brown
sugar
flavors
rich
malts
blend
perfectly
with
the
subtle
and
amazing
array
of
spices
full
mouthfeel
little
carbonation
the
10
alcohol
is
hardly
even
a
thought
as
youre
drinking
it
just
an
outstanding
beer
and
one
every
beer
lover
should
enjoy
notes
glad
that
glass
came
today
because
i
wasnt
going
to
drink
tonight
however
now
im
just
going
to
pop
a
movie
in
and
sip
on
this
one
for
a
while
overall
this
is
by
far
one
of
the
best
beers
ive
ever
had
in
my
life
the
balance
and
complexity
in
the
mouth
is
rave
worthy
ive
been
looking
forward
to
trying
this
well
promoted
belgian
for
some
time
now
and
am
looking
extremely
forward
to
drinking
it
again
this
is
an
excellent
special
occasion
drink
the
drinkability
of
this
beer
is
very
good
the
alcohol
is
pretty
much
nonexistent
is
a
sea
of
flavor
id
love
to
have
another
but
i
only
have
one
330
ml
bottle
oh
well
makes
it
more
of
a
treat
pours
a
merkey
brownish
red
and
retains
a
fluffy
bubbley
slightly
off
white
head
there
is
some
yeast
sediment
in
the
bottle
but
not
as
much
as
i
have
gotten
in
some
other
bottles
of
abt
12
the
aromas
coming
from
my
glass
are
heavenly
with
the
addition
of
typical
belgian
trappist
ale
aromas
plum
sweet
figs
other
dried
fruit
i
can
pick
up
hints
of
apple
pear
and
the
aroma
is
rather
smooth
than
others
i
have
sampled
with
less
of
a
present
alchol
character
in
its
smell
the
taste
oh
and
the
taste
again
contains
characteristics
true
to
most
quadrupels
but
is
set
apart
with
how
incredibley
smooth
and
well
balanced
the
flavors
flow
together
each
characteristic
seems
to
blend
into
each
other
and
leave
you
with
this
aftertaste
of
a
wonderful
mix
of
fruits
mollasses
and
a
ever
so
slight
alcohol
warming
the
mouthfeel
is
silkier
than
expected
but
each
flavor
sticks
to
your
taste
buds
this
is
a
beer
that
needs
exploring
to
really
get
and
i
plan
to
explore
this
deserves
its
recognition
the
beer
is
just
smooth
a
complex
and
full
body
very
complex
and
a
real
treat
believe
the
hype
pours
a
beautiful
burgundybrown
in
my
goblet
a
thick
lingering
offwhite
colored
foam
develops
and
seems
to
stay
intact
for
hours
the
beer
seems
somewhat
viscous
but
not
overdone
i
can
detect
dark
fruits
alcohol
bread
figs
and
some
plum
aromas
very
interesting
and
unique
even
for
this
style
the
taste
is
just
incredible
playful
bitterness
upfront
with
a
strong
sweet
malt
finish
that
is
dry
and
rich
a
bit
of
warming
alcohol
sensation
as
well
takes
more
like
a
dubbel
than
a
quadrupel
in
terms
of
being
an
acquired
taste
as
the
beer
warms
more
complex
and
rich
flavors
become
apparent
some
spices
seem
to
appear
and
linger
in
the
aftertaste
some
roasted
characteristics
seem
to
prevail
as
well
as
the
beer
warms
the
most
incredible
thing
about
this
beer
is
that
it
is
very
very
drinkable
the
alcohol
doesnt
make
itself
known
until
after
a
glass
or
two
just
an
incredible
brew
one
of
my
favorites
without
a
doubt
well
worth
the
9
i
paid
for
this
bottle
the
scariest
part
about
this
beer
is
how
easy
it
goes
down
you
dont
realize
that
its
a
10
beer
until
you
fall
off
your
stool
750
ml
bottle
this
beer
pours
out
a
dark
brown
color
with
a
huge
head
delicious
aroma
of
bread
chocolate
dark
fruit
vanilla
and
spice
sweet
caramel
malt
flavor
with
cocoa
licorice
and
pepper
finishes
spicy
with
cloves
and
more
pepper
and
a
little
bitter
the
flavor
is
big
yet
somehow
delicate
very
complex
flavors
no
sign
of
the
alcohol
mouthfeel
is
creamy
incredible
drinkability
this
beer
is
allaround
fantastic
let
this
one
warm
up
a
bit
brings
out
more
of
the
fruity
notes
and
covers
the
alcohol
wonderful
sipping
brew
closer
to
a
desert
or
wine
than
your
average
beer
a
truly
incredible
beer
just
watch
out
when
you
stand
up
after
finishing
it
words
cant
even
begin
to
describe
the
experience
of
drinking
it
now
if
only
i
can
justify
the
cost
of
a
750ml
bottle
next
time
drinkability
a
brew
thats
more
than
fine
and
should
be
treated
as
such
find
it
admire
it
take
it
in
and
enjoy
it
one
of
the
best
of
the
quads
an
essential
an
absolutely
terrific
beer
my
favorite
it
was
served
in
a
oversized
wine
glass
it
was
a
deep
and
rich
black
with
only
a
little
light
permeating
there
was
a
rich
but
receding
1
5
finger
head
the
beer
smelled
of
nuts
rich
chocolate
and
alcohol
i
cannot
overstate
how
overwhelmingly
complex
this
beer
is
drinking
it
is
a
joy
because
as
i
work
my
way
through
the
glass
it
is
a
struggle
to
try
to
figure
out
what
flavors
are
coming
through
there
is
certainly
a
good
deal
of
chocolate
but
there
is
also
a
mild
fruitiness
i
certainly
get
a
good
deal
of
prunes
this
is
a
wonderful
beer
on
the
whole
thanks
kent
austin
this
is
one
of
my
if
you
were
stranded
on
a
desert
island
what
beer
would
you
take
with
you
brews
exceptional
10
cant
tell
very
well
hidden
that
is
until
you
stand
up
after
finishing
the
bottle
mouthfeeldrinkability
perfect
this
beer
is
a
world
class
quadrupel
one
that
should
be
tried
and
enjoyed
by
all
strong
with
many
subtle
flavors
competing
with
big
flavors
even
so
this
beer
is
extraordinarily
drinkable
overall
very
nice
quadrupel
as
this
is
easily
the
best
belgian
ive
had
to
date
being
more
of
an
advocate
of
big
american
styles
im
sort
of
on
a
belgian
kick
right
now
and
i
have
a
lot
to
try
so
this
may
not
remain
my
highest
rated
but
at
any
rate
this
is
an
excellent
beer
and
well
worthy
of
two
thumbs
i
have
two
more
of
these
in
the
closet
so
ill
be
rereviewing
this
over
the
next
couple
of
years
as
well
btw
ive
finished
this
beer
way
too
quickly
and
im
noticing
a
buzz
after
just
one
bottle
excellent
but
drinkers
beware
pours
a
dark
murky
reddish
brown
with
lots
of
clumpy
yeast
sediment
floating
about
a
finger
of
khaki
head
that
looks
like
capuccino
with
cinnamon
with
dark
yeast
floating
in
the
foam
wasnt
sure
if
this
was
right
but
reading
other
reviews
it
seems
standard
smells
strongly
of
dark
fruits
sweet
roasted
malt
and
alcoholic
vapors
taste
starts
off
with
raisins
vinuous
overripe
grapes
banana
esters
loads
of
spicy
brown
sugary
malts
and
a
hearty
warming
alcohol
flush
mouthfeel
is
smooth
but
crisp
a
nice
complex
belgian
here
reminds
me
more
of
a
belgian
strong
dark
ale
than
a
quad
but
either
way
a
top
notch
brew
worth
seeking
out
the
mouthfeel
is
silky
and
carbonated
it
has
that
feel
of
an
aged
beer
thick
and
heavy
but
not
coating
i
could
drink
many
of
these
as
long
as
i
didnt
eat
like
i
said
liquid
bread
dwow
this
beer
is
bold
and
complex
in
flavor
but
nice
and
light
in
mouthfeel
the
alcohol
warmth
is
not
overpowering
and
really
balances
the
complexity
of
the
malts
i
will
take
another
this
is
a
masterfully
crafted
ale
that
seduces
the
seneses
with
each
and
every
sip
keeping
stride
with
the
westvleterens
and
rocheforts
this
beer
plays
no
such
second
fiddel
i
dont
think
im
quite
worthy
to
catalogue
all
the
complexity
of
this
stuff
i
couldnt
resist
pouring
another
glass
even
though
it
was
a
school
night
that
should
say
enough
delicious
pours
into
my
chimay
chalice
a
murky
dark
brown
with
a
ruby
tint
and
a
thick
offwhite
head
that
retains
well
and
coats
the
sides
of
the
glass
the
aroma
is
intense
and
complex
notes
of
cherry
candied
sugar
plum
fig
date
barnyard
toasted
bread
light
spices
grassy
hops
slight
vinegar
sourness
and
some
light
phenols
and
alcohol
flavor
begins
with
some
lightly
tart
fruit
real
cherries
fig
date
plum
and
raisins
then
some
candied
sugar
sweetness
spices
clove
corriander
anise
malty
toasted
bread
some
light
phenols
vinous
alcohol
character
and
some
light
grassy
and
floral
hops
the
body
on
this
beer
is
huge
with
light
carbonation
and
a
creamy
but
thick
texture
with
some
moderate
alcohol
tones
coming
through
i
thoroughly
enjoyed
this
beer
and
it
was
fairly
easy
to
drink
despite
its
high
abv
this
beer
is
definately
an
experience
in
a
bottle
delicious
and
heavy
it
meets
my
high
expectations
this
is
a
good
beer
but
not
a
great
one
in
my
opinion
the
strong
alcohol
detracts
from
the
rest
of
the
flavours
and
the
dryness
left
in
the
mouth
really
isnt
satisfying
and
is
annoying
after
awhile
really
left
me
thinking
that
i
was
drinking
a
dry
wine
instead
of
a
beer
fullbodied
and
very
rich
the
longlasting
head
adds
to
the
creamy
mouthfeel
silky
smooth
good
carbonation
nice
warming
effect
slight
sweetness
in
the
finish
great
sipping
night
cap
it
certainly
seems
to
hit
all
the
style
guidelines
this
beer
would
be
good
as
a
dessert
beer
but
not
a
session
drink
just
way
too
thick
to
drink
much
of
very
tasty
brew
much
thanks
to
lrrr
for
hooking
me
up
ive
had
it
on
tap
and
i
am
writing
this
review
from
a
bottle
the
bottle
seems
a
bit
more
tame
then
when
i
tried
it
on
tap
i
was
expecting
a
little
more
power
and
it
wasnt
really
delivering
could
have
mistaked
it
for
a
dubbel
but
maybe
i
had
an
off
bottle
i
will
be
seeking
out
other
quads
to
get
some
reference
points
d
to
steal
a
quote
from
the
great
michael
jackson
this
beer
is
dangerously
drinkable
its
got
everything
a
quad
needs
to
have
the
drinker
going
mmm
after
each
sip
savor
this
one
this
is
an
awesome
brew
truely
amazing
beer
in
every
aspect
poured
out
to
a
dark
cider
color
but
is
more
auburn
when
held
to
the
light
nice
cream
colored
head
about
12
an
inch
and
consistant
to
the
bottom
of
the
glass
medium
low
carbonation
aromas
of
yeast
malt
and
some
sweetness
all
around
very
rich
and
full
taste
is
delectible
flavors
of
dark
fruits
malt
some
earthy
notes
smooth
and
slightly
sweet
and
bitter
towards
the
finish
some
alcohol
is
noted
but
it
doesnt
indicate
the
10abv
this
brew
has
medium
body
mouthfeel
is
smooth
like
velvet
and
slightly
creamy
very
good
drinkability
i
could
have
this
morning
noon
and
night
highly
recommended
d
if
alcohol
flavor
doesnt
bother
you
too
much
than
this
is
a
drinkable
beer
but
it
is
very
lacking
all
around
a
big
disappointment
rocheforte
10
is
much
better
and
i
didnt
even
like
that
too
much
a
tasty
beer
overall
i
think
this
is
a
lovely
beer
bright
and
very
striking
flavors
but
compared
to
westy
12
well
w12
is
more
maturetasting
harmonized
and
i
feel
overall
a
better
tasting
brew
id
definitely
get
this
again
though
and
again
worldclass
beer
and
a
great
quad
the
head
is
dense
and
a
little
lighter
and
smaller
than
the
w12
the
beer
shows
more
brown
less
red
and
a
little
lighter
the
nose
is
tangier
more
fruity
with
less
of
the
toffeecaramel
malt
tangy
fruit
in
front
nice
deep
toffee
malt
in
the
middle
but
not
quite
as
much
butter
the
alcohol
in
the
finish
is
a
little
metallic
not
as
smooth
as
the
w
more
woody
and
appley
this
is
still
an
outstanding
beer
sidebyside
with
the
westy
it
seems
a
little
raw
not
as
smooth
and
butterymaltybready
but
delicious
no
doubt
opinion
so
what
can
i
say
this
beer
is
fabulous
it
is
a
monument
of
the
complexity
of
beer
and
what
a
subtle
blend
can
do
i
only
took
a
tad
off
for
drinkability
because
you
can
tell
that
it
is
huge
its
not
for
the
faint
of
palate
but
not
as
bad
as
arrogant
bastard
this
is
a
beautiful
beer
this
is
a
great
beer
and
is
very
drinkable
i
highly
recommend
it
overall
a
very
good
beer
thats
worth
a
try
id
love
to
have
it
on
tap
actually
because
i
imagine
that
will
trump
my
rating
of
the
bottled
version
overall
i
like
this
beer
but
its
not
quite
the
tour
de
force
that
i
was
expecting
its
very
good
but
not
at
the
top
of
its
class
i
would
gladly
have
one
of
these
anytime
though
where
do
you
begin
with
this
one
mouthfeel
is
slightly
astringent
but
not
too
harsh
alcohol
is
evident
in
the
finish
taste
is
of
fresh
fruit
slightly
acidic
on
the
palate
the
only
thing
that
detracts
from
this
brew
is
the
dominant
alcohol
presence
which
lessens
the
drinkability
still
this
deserves
to
be
sipped
would
be
great
on
a
winter
day
an
excellent
brew
by
any
standard
this
is
the
highest
rated
beer
ive
had
the
chance
to
taste
and
it
only
strengthens
my
faith
in
the
ba
communitys
skill
at
picking
out
a
winner
tried
not
to
let
the
high
ratings
influence
mine
but
this
is
one
of
the
best
beers
ive
had
this
abbey
ale
is
presented
in
11
2
oz
brown
bottle
that
lists
both
best
before
date
and
suggested
serving
temperature
cheers
to
that
i
dont
know
if
i
like
it
as
much
as
the
westvleteren
12
but
given
the
relative
ease
of
getting
the
abt
12
it
is
a
major
hit
in
my
book
i
definately
will
be
looking
for
more
ot
this
a
fantastic
beer
i
will
enjoy
many
more
of
these
in
years
to
come
it
pours
a
deep
murky
brown
color
with
a
solid
2
5
finger
head
over
top
that
falls
very
slowly
the
nose
is
full
on
raisin
and
fig
character
with
a
nice
spicey
character
hiding
in
there
as
well
the
flavor
is
subdued
from
the
nose
a
bit
the
yeast
imparts
a
creamy
character
on
top
of
the
sweet
raisin
and
light
brown
sugar
character
very
nice
flavor
the
feel
is
moderate
with
a
light
carbonation
im
finding
it
to
be
a
sipping
beer
not
something
i
can
drink
a
whole
lot
of
at
a
time
i
like
it
definately
not
as
good
as
the
same
beer
off
tap
ill
rerate
this
one
when
i
have
it
off
tap
again
still
a
nice
brew
overall
a
world
class
beer
not
quite
up
there
with
the
westy
but
not
far
off
big
bodied
poured
out
dark
brown
cloudy
with
huge
head
the
aroma
is
raisinchocolately
sweet
the
alcohol
is
well
hidden
and
doesnt
show
until
the
end
of
the
chalice
the
taste
is
a
cross
of
fruit
and
choclate
mixed
with
a
ton
of
sweet
malt
and
a
touch
of
brown
sugar
it
is
a
brew
for
all
to
enjoy
the
malty
sweetness
adds
to
the
thick
bready
mouthfeel
just
a
side
note
i
find
little
if
any
difference
between
this
and
westy
12
imo
quite
nice
this
one
is
hard
to
approach
without
high
expectations
st
bernardus
the
jolly
monkand
why
not
holding
a
chalice
glass
of
the
stuff
on
the
label
seems
to
exude
glee
and
the
beer
seems
to
as
well
abt
12
or
the
blue
cap
bottle
states
simply
in
english
on
the
back
bottle
fermented
beer
this
bottle
poured
with
a
medium
head
making
it
able
to
pour
the
full
bottle
without
having
to
wait
for
the
foam
to
settle
i
was
expecting
a
denser
head
however
because
it
did
not
pour
very
creamily
more
large
bubbles
than
small
the
head
is
a
very
lightish
brown
colour
and
seemed
comfortable
and
stable
as
a
thin
but
full
topping
to
the
beer
the
beer
itself
is
an
almost
impenetrable
rubydark
brown
appearing
near
ebony
from
most
angles
lacing
is
excellent
leaving
thin
sheets
around
the
glass
that
dissipate
into
islands
the
aroma
is
not
very
assertive
but
when
coaxed
it
is
quite
delectable
very
sublte
dark
malting
along
with
black
currants
and
prunes
the
sweetness
is
readily
evident
in
the
form
of
raisins
and
green
apple
peel
like
st
bernardus
tripel
red
wine
and
red
grapes
blueberry
licorice
and
leather
pears
and
green
apples
and
spicy
rummy
pepper
that
tickles
the
nose
this
could
almost
pass
at
times
for
merlot
or
cabernet
wine
a
distinct
creaminess
asserts
itself
through
the
whole
drink
the
aroma
is
delicious
but
not
unlike
anything
i
have
had
before
certainly
nothing
to
make
it
exceptional
for
me
personally
the
taste
is
full
of
big
flavours
spicy
alcohol
rich
malts
dark
fruits
and
wine
the
front
of
the
tongue
senses
the
red
wine
taste
tannic
and
dry
the
middle
draws
out
some
of
the
toasted
malts
and
the
finish
leaves
a
balanced
nuttiness
equal
parts
dry
and
sweet
the
carbonation
was
a
little
high
and
the
bottle
started
to
overflow
when
i
popped
the
cap
not
sure
why
they
have
been
sitting
in
my
cellar
for
2
weeks
upright
far
too
foamy
in
the
mouth
this
bottle
the
mouthfeel
is
still
quite
thick
and
lingering
however
drinkability
with
the
balanced
sweetness
and
small
amount
of
alcohol
in
the
taste
is
extremely
hight
for
a
gravity
such
as
this
i
paired
it
with
brie
and
3year
aged
cheddar
the
brie
is
mostly
overpowered
by
the
beer
but
the
sharp
taste
of
the
aged
cheddar
could
compete
and
added
to
the
enjoyment
and
complexity
of
the
beer
i
fear
these
bottles
may
be
a
tad
defective
somehow
not
totally
but
i
think
the
beer
is
not
at
its
peak
qualitywise
if
it
is
though
i
have
tasted
this
beers
equal
and
find
it
good
but
not
sensational
or
unique
very
fine
stuff
i
shall
be
investing
in
more
but
only
one
at
a
time
for
me
in
a
sitting
theres
enough
within
a
lone
bottle
to
keep
me
satiated
for
the
time
being
the
sign
of
a
fine
ale
you
know
youd
like
another
one
but
it
leaves
you
satisfied
enough
that
you
dont
need
it
right
now
drinkability
fabulous
really
its
that
good
i
thought
this
beer
may
have
been
over
hyped
but
that
is
not
at
all
the
case
this
is
a
truly
magnificent
beer
there
are
no
offensive
or
weird
flavors
all
of
the
flavors
work
well
together
making
this
a
remarkably
drinkable
beer
all
around
this
is
a
wonderful
beer
world
class
and
kick
ass
if
you
are
settling
in
for
the
25
4
oz
set
away
some
time
for
an
immense
sensory
experience
as
quads
go
this
is
my
favorite
hands
down
a
pretty
drinkable
brew
just
a
faint
twinge
of
alcohol
in
the
aftertaste
what
a
classic
it
is
a
beuatiful
brown
with
a
tan
head
that
hangs
out
before
becoming
spotty
smells
of
dark
dried
fruit
and
malt
sweetness
it
has
a
lovely
taste
that
livens
the
tongue
close
to
an
earthyness
that
makes
the
fruit
all
the
nicer
slightly
dry
finish
that
is
enhanced
by
the
bold
carbonation
a
creamy
dream
of
a
treat
that
is
worth
the
time
to
get
to
know
dn
wonderful
beer
really
should
try
this
one
if
you
find
it
this
beer
definitely
deserves
the
outstanding
status
it
has
received
definately
a
fine
brew
however
i
was
a
little
disapointed
i
think
my
expectations
may
have
been
built
up
from
such
a
high
rating
if
i
had
10
dollars
and
could
find
it
again
i
would
consider
giving
it
another
chance
hazy
orangebrown
with
a
decent
stand
of
tan
head
complex
aroma
consisting
of
light
maltiness
warm
alcohol
grassy
and
citrusy
hops
and
white
wine
fruitiness
bitterness
was
on
the
low
side
but
plenty
of
grassy
hops
were
present
in
the
flavour
along
with
a
good
malt
character
alcohol
warmth
and
a
peppery
spiciness
appeared
at
the
dry
finish
medium
body
with
moderately
high
carbonation
this
beer
was
definitely
aided
by
warming
up
a
bit
though
it
didnt
start
out
poorly
it
did
become
much
more
pleasant
towards
the
end
of
the
glass
thanks
viggo
the
mouthfeel
could
be
a
little
thicker
i
think
but
thats
the
only
thing
id
change
about
this
one
and
its
very
nice
as
it
is
drinkability
is
a
little
low
due
to
the
high
abv
but
this
one
is
so
easy
to
sip
that
it
could
sneak
up
on
you
quite
a
nice
beer
and
one
thats
definitely
worth
trying
the
tale
of
the
quadrupel
is
one
not
told
enough
the
bernardus
abt
12
is
definitely
a
fine
member
of
the
family
with
a
dark
caramel
color
large
bubbles
and
good
lacing
it
was
certainly
something
to
look
at
the
smell
was
faint
with
traces
of
fruits
and
alcohol
the
taste
was
similar
with
the
alcohol
maybe
coming
through
a
little
strong
though
covering
up
some
of
the
delicious
citrus
overall
a
good
beer
i
strongly
recommend
drinking
at
the
proper
temp
of
5055
because
the
flavor
certainly
improved
as
it
warmed
a
truly
exceptional
beer
world
class
by
all
means
it
was
hard
to
find
any
fault
in
this
beer
definitely
worth
the
4
i
paid
for
the
bottle
and
something
i
will
never
hesitate
to
pick
up
again
cheers
again
the
belgians
are
never
short
on
balance
everything
is
balanced
about
this
beer
from
the
pour
to
the
deep
rich
color
to
the
exciting
malty
nose
and
the
taste
orgasmic
top
ten
indeed
and
the
cool
thing
about
belgian
beer
it
gets
better
as
you
drink
it
but
once
the
glass
is
finished
youre
pissed
off
because
its
gone
these
beers
are
like
a
woman
with
pms
you
run
the
gamut
of
emotions
with
each
one
pours
a
very
cloudy
orangebrown
looks
kind
of
like
iced
tea
with
a
thick
generous
head
and
lots
of
lace
smells
very
citrusy
a
little
alcohol
is
present
little
bit
of
malt
a
fruity
white
wine
sort
of
aroma
very
pleasant
the
taste
is
grassy
some
alcohol
notes
sweet
up
front
with
a
currant
taste
and
a
spicy
finish
this
is
one
beer
that
has
to
be
at
least
cellar
temperature
it
because
very
noticably
better
as
it
warmed
up
further
very
full
creamy
mouthfeel
smooth
with
high
carbonation
world
class
ale
taste
this
is
possibly
the
besttasting
beer
ive
tried
to
date
if
i
go
fat
and
bald
from
drinking
this
beer
its
worth
the
price
god
bless
the
monks
from
westvleteren
who
apparently
created
the
recipe
for
this
beer
god
bless
also
the
brewers
at
watou
who
make
this
intense
stuff
the
beer
is
fullbodied
and
leaves
a
coating
in
your
mouth
a
good
thing
im
not
that
good
at
picking
out
individual
flavors
but
i
can
taste
sweet
fruity
flavors
plums
grapes
and
bananas
with
malt
chocolate
and
bread
i
poured
this
below
the
temperature
recommended
on
the
bottle
5256f
and
i
think
the
taste
becomes
more
intense
as
the
liquid
warms
drinkability
if
i
had
another
id
pour
it
cheers
pours
dark
brown
with
an

you
drink
aroma

caramel

flavor
is
warm

and
creamy

body
fullbodied

very
drinkable
and
warming
overall
this
beer
was
as
close
to
perfect
for
a
belgian
as
you
can
get
amazing
brew
taste
was
what
the
aroma
hinted
at
nice
creamy
feel
with
caramel
and
spice
and
a
slight
warmth
from
the
alcohol
this
was
probably
the
most
enjoyed
beer
i
have
experienced
yet
poured
an
unusual
dark
brown
with
a
purple
winelike
hue
noticeable
yeast
floaties
the
smell
immediately
reminded
me
of
alter
wine
the
taste
was
wonderful
rich
dark
fruits
raisin
plums
and
sweet
grape
slight
alcohol
warmth
and
breadlike
yeast
flavor
very
rich
smooth
feel
in
the
mouth
i
drank
this
in
10
minutes
and
felt
like
i
was
taking
my
time
with
it
i
just
could
not
help
but
to
keep
sipping
away
almost
continuously
i
only
had
one
i
will
need
to
track
more
down
had
this
with
a
marinated
lamb
dish
a
couple
days
before
christmas
and
forgot
to
review
everyone
at
the
table
was
a
wine
drinker
they
were
blown
away
dark
fruits
rule
here
figs
dates
plums
fluffy
brown
sugar
nuts
and
some
earthy
flavours
as
well
very
smooth
enjoyable
oh
well
ill
hit
this
up
again
and
again
this
beer
certainly
lived
up
to
all
of
my
expectations
and
then
some
it
was
a
perfect
way
for
me
to
close
out
my
senior
year
of
college
i
would
love
to
try
this
on
tap
sometime
since
there
is
a
place
near
me
that
has
it
okay
i
reviewed
this
beer
early
on
while
i
was
developing
my
review
skills
my
score
for
it
then
came
out
at
4
9
and
ive
been
interested
in
seeing
if
the
beers
holds
true
mind
you
i
just
had
a
pater
6
so
my
tastebuds
should
be
primed
the
number
on
the
back
of
this
bottle
reads
271009
oops
into
the
glass
went
all
the
sediment
oh
well
its
an
abbey
ale
obtained
from
johns
groceryiowa
city
and
they
kept
it
in
a
fridge
in
may
2005
and
consumed
about
a
week
later
pours
a
2
finger
light
brown
particulated
head
over
a
dark
brown
particulated
liquid
smells
of
candisugar
alcohol
and
chocolate
the
alcohol
is
strong
in
i
a
burning
of
the
nose
sense
and
ii
a
volitility
aspect
that
is
different
and
that
i
cant
quite
describe
taste
is
alcohol
with
chocolate
beneath
and
a
nice
nutty
finish
whoa
buddy
this
is
quite
a
doozie
the
alcohol
stands
of
notice
throughout
with
a
constantly
changing
and
interesting
background
of
malt
spice
and
fruit
if
the
alcohol
is
the
everpresent
orchestra
the
background
is
a
stageplay
of
many
phenomenal
different
scenes
brought
on
stage
what
the
heck
is
that
intriguing
spice
it
has
a
pepper
and
licorice
quality
about
it
but
isnt
quite
either
ive
tasted
it
before
but
cant
put
my
finger
on
it
anise
but
i
think
more
the
end
is
quite
chocolatey
almost
fudgelike
but
the
initial
sugar
sweet
comes
to
a
stark
dry
finish
thick
mouthfeel
and
moderately
carbonated
a
touch
more
than
i
would
have
liked
nice
lacing
inside
the
glass
really
delightful
as
the
beer
warmed
the
chocolate
became
a
persistent
flavor
that
rivaled
the
alcohol
chocolate
carries
so
many
flavors
well
that
this
beer
was
much
better
warm
i
recommend
drinking
this
beer
between
cellar
and
room
temperature
its
225
in
the
afternoon
the
day
after
drinking
four
11
2
ounce
bottles
and
i
still
have
a
headache
take
it
easy
with
this
stuff
drinkability
i
drank
that
bottle
down
with
ease
and
was
ready
for
a
2nd
quite
drinkable
for
containing
such
a
high
amount
of
alcohol
330ml
bottle
thanks
sammy
finally
got
around
to
quaffing
this
bad
boy
pours
murky
in
my
goblet
redish
brown
highlights
when
held
to
the
light
lots
of
sediment
in
suspension
and
on
the
bottom
of
the
bottle
fat
meringue
like
tan
head
which
lasts
until
the
last
gulp
excellent
lacing
light
carbonation
aroma
of
dark
fruits
rum
wine
alcohol
and
bready
malts
effervescent
up
front
followed
with
a
complex
array
of
flavors
dried
dark
fruits
nuts
red
grape
wine
and
spicey
yeast
long
finish
bread
dough
yeasty
almonds
and
rum
in
the
after
taste
as
the
ale
warms
in
the
goblet
the
malts
become
cookie
dough
sweet
spicer
and
more
intoxicating
what
a
whallop
all
ale
should
be
like
this
popping
the
cap
from
the
11oz
bottle
releases
a
flutter
of
bananay
belgian
yeast
aroma
poured
into
my
duvel
tulip
the
beer
has
a
sizeable
oneinch
tan
head
that
sticks
around
for
a
while
body
is
a
slightly
cloudy
deep
mahogany
color
nose
is
dominated
by
sweet
malt
and
alcohol
with
notes
of
brown
sugar
yeast
and
a
hint
of
stone
fruit
palate
is
very
nice
sweet
malt
is
dominant
with
notes
of
clove
allspice
and
a
very
subtle
hoppiness
the
finish
is
dominated
by
warmth
from
the
alcohol
but
tempered
by
a
lingering
sweetness
from
the
malt
rich
creamy
warm
mouthfeel
is
as
close
to
perfection
as
you
can
get
this
beer
is
an
absolute
pleasure
to
drink
even
if
it
takes
over
an
hour
to
get
to
the
bottom
of
the
glass
malt
grapes
citrus
a
wonderful
finish
for
me
tastes
and
smells
are
everything
i
have
come
to
enjoy
in
this
style
tasty
alcohol
accented
by
its
wonderful
characteristics
a
beer
worthy
of
its
rating
get
yourself
some
the
first
think
you
notice
about
the
taste
is
the
warming
sensation
you
get
from
the
liberal
amount
of
alcohol
this
is
one
beer
that
will
knock
you
down
very
fruity
i
detect
prunes
and
other
sundried
fruits
citric
hops
in
the
background
medicinal
qualities
abound
very
dry
finish
and
the
carbonation
keeps
your
tongue
feeling
refreshed
after
every
sip
i
would
salivate
and
it
would
keep
my
mouth
well
lubed
immensely
complex
and
it
is
obvious
care
was
taken
in
making
this
baby
not
entirely
drinkable
because
you
are
forced
to
sip
this
and
one
bottle
should
be
enough
for
a
night
not
a
session
brew
but
not
meant
to
be
this
was
a
perfect
compliment
to
my
last
day
of
classes
for
the
year
slàinte
fantasic
experience
with
this
highlytouted
belgian
pours
a
monster
head
that
lingers
all
night
smell
is
of
alcohol
and
grains
taste
is
of
cloves
and
chocolate
extremely
sweet
almost
colalike
i
made
the
mistake
of
mixing
this
in
the
middle
of
session
brews
and
woke
up
with
one
hell
of
a
headache
sip
this
baby
by
itself
and
youre
in
for
quite
a
treat
indeed
pours
a
raisin
brown
with
a
frothy
offwhite
head
that
diminishes
to
form
a
skim
coat
and
some
yeasty
floaters
smells
of
tart
fruity
esters
candy
sweetness
apples
and
plums
bready
vinous

notes
tastes
much
the
same
initially
very
malty
and
sweet
becoming
more
fruity
and
vinous
in
character
lots
of
bready
banana
yeast
sugary
sweet
mixed
with
a
spicy
hop

and
a
lingering
vinous

carbonation
this
is
what
i
envision
a
quad
to
be

a
nearly
perfect
brew
pours
a
deep

a
big

leaving
nice
sheets
of

of

a
faint
smokiness
the
alcolhol
shows
itself
more
as
it

just
an
awesome
beer
have
sampled
many
times
was
great
to
aquire
a
bottleworthy
of
its
high
marks
awesome
thin
cream
head
with
a
constant
burst
and
replacement

going
on
mahogany
warm

but
it
could
not
be
seen
through
big
malt
nose
with
peat
moss
and
other
earthy
tones
bread
crust
scrumptious
balance
of
hops
and
malt
though
i
tasted
more
of
the
latter
than
the
former
and
a
serious
alcohol
hit
of
heat
crisp
and
slightly
tart
mouth
feel
truly
a
great
offering
this
is
one
i
would
gladly
have
again
and
again
fullbodied
with
a
velvety
smooth
mouthfeel
never
gets
cloying
a
wonderful
beer
the
taste
is
spicy
with
lots
of
complexity
lots
of
fruit
flavors
hit
your
mouth
fig
banana
and
plum
flavors
come
out
wonderful
aftertaste
and
the
complexity
and
flavor
hides
the
abv
although
it
can
be
noticed
this
is
a
truly
great
beer
that
i
may
not
be
worthy
of
i
prefer
it
to
any
belgian
beer
that
i
have
had
to
date
pretty
much
everything
but
westy
at
this
point
i
would
highly
recommend
it
to
others
wow
what
a
beautiful
beer
it
poured
perfectly
into
a
chalice
with
a
thick
silky
head
that
looked
like
a
cappuccino
and
once
the
sediment
poured
out
it
looked
like
cinnamon
on
top
the
head
glistened
and
had
a
subtle
sound
believe
it
or
not
dark
brown
color
and
a
wonderful
nose
make
all
your
senses
go
crazy
you
must
let
this
beer
warm
to
fully
appreciate
its
depth
and
range
of
flavors
chocolate
malt
honey
and
subtle
spices
in
a
silky
seductive
package
i
paired
it
with
a
blue
cheese
and
this
beer
cleaned
my
palate
perfectly
it
is
like
a
bolder
rochefort
10
which
does
not
mean
better

just
stronger
flavors
excellent
note
after
trying
the
st
bernardus
6
8
tripel
and
abt
12
i
am
thouroughly
impressed
and
enamored
with
this
beer
absolutely
top
notch
in
every
respect
and
impossible
to
pick
a
favorite
thanks
again
gabe
for
sharing
it
makes
a
difference
a
winner
in
my
book
and
perhaps
my
overall
favorite
ale
cloudy
hue
somewhere
between
copper
and
burgundy
under
a
one
finger
beige
head
that
settles
quickly
at
first
then
lingers
as
very
thick
film
across
the
top
of
the
liquid
for
a
very
long
time
i
see
a
few
strands
of
lace
but
the
head
is
not
very
sticky
and
lacks
a
bit
in
body
the
nose
is
just
right
not
overpowering
and
not
mild
fruit
is
the
main
impression
with
yeast
and
barley
backing
that
up
the
mouth
is
very
well
carbonated
and
slightly
viscous
not
heavy
but
there
is
a
coating
sensation
on
the
tongue
the
taste
is
sublime
smooth
bready
malt
a
touch
of
fruity
twang
a
hint
of
hoppy
bitterness
the
alcohol
is
well
concealed
but
not
invisible
weve
got
great
balance
here
in
a
beer
that
cannot
be
enjoyed
in
quantity
on
a
given
night
but
can
be
enjoyed
on
many
given
nights
fully
bodied
drinkability
was
only
on
the
average
side
the
high
alcohol
content
does
not
hurt
this
beer
you
will
not
even
realize
you
are
drinking
alcohol
this
is
a
very
drinkable
beer
that
everyone
needs
to
try
correction
on
the
head
the
second
pour
produced
a
very
nice
head
drinkability
one
of
my
favorite
beers
i
could
drink
this
all
night
long
at
least
until
the
alcohol
caught
up
with
me
an
awesome
beer
pours
a
very
dark
magohany
with
a
large
foamy
tan
head
that
looks
amazing
and
laces
very
well
aroma
or
cherries
banana
dark
fruits
very
good
taste
was
a
sweet
roasted
malt
and
fruits
with
some
alcohol
tastefully
in
the
finish
also
some
smokiness
and
hops
in
the
finish
a
very
complex
finish
smooth
creamy
mouthfeel
lots
of
carbonation
and
the
alcohol
gets
a
little
strong
as
it
warms
this
is
very
drinkable
but
it
is
gonna
hit
me
rerate

a
little
soapsudsy
this
time
pretty
sure
it
wasnt
my
glass
body
has
a
lot
of
dark
red
in
it
with
hints
of
deep
purple
smell
hit
me
as
oaky
anise
with
blackberries
and
cotton
candy
flavor
is
a
plumwine
with
a
spicy
semidry
finish
reminiscent
of
some
red
wines
perhaps
last
time
i
did
not
allow
it
to
warm
sufficiently
because
the
feel
is
very
smooth
and
marshmallowy
with
only
that
little
spicy
bite
very
drinkable
a
balance
between
brightness
and
darkness
fruity
but
deep
light
feel
but
substantial
malt
and

presence
hazy
medium

more
of
a

hue
with
some

highlights
a
thick
well
defined

bubbly

to
well
formed
cloying
bubbles
that
stick
with
great
dedication
to
the
sides
of
the
chalice
fresh
fruit
malts
raisins
traces
of
alcohol
and
some
portwine
notes
on
the
nose
very
nice
an
initial
onslaught
of
delightful
flavorings

plums
raisins
licorise
and
sweet
malts
full
bodied
and
borderline
chewy
further
warming
evolves
figs
grapes
and
pears
even
further
into
the
flavoring
reveals
a
slight
hopbased
backbone
brown
sugar
grapes
and
even
some
coffee
beans
the
abv
at
10
is
spoton
its
noticeable
but
in
a
good
way
rich
and
full
flavored
a
thing
of
beauty
final
thoughts
this
is
without
a
doubt
an
exceptional
beer
as
with
all
quadrupels
ive
had
so
far
though
the
serving
temperature
is
a
very
delicate
thing
and
could
have
a
great
impact
on
the
smell
taste
and
mouthfeel
not
having
had
the
westvleteren
12
yet
id
say
this
beer
is
only
outclassed
by
the
rochefort
10
in
its
style
wich
is
a
little
more
full
round
and
bold
still
nevertheless
though
this
brew
is
close
to
perfection
and
great
in
its
own
ways
world
class
i
just
wanted
to
say
that
i
had
this
beer
on
tap
and
it
doesnt
quite
stand
up
to
the
bottle
version
which
is
unusual
not
quite
as
creamy
and
frothy
not
the
same
velvety
mouthfeel
not
as
rich
and
sweet
in
flavor
and
i
can
taste
the
alcohol
a
bit
more
its
still
a
great
beer
dont
get
me
wrong
but
the
bottle
conditioned
verision
of
this
masterpiece
is
on
a
different
level
peace
absolutely
wonderful
dangerously
drinkable
i
always
wait
for
the
end
of
the
evening
to
partake
of
one
of
these
since
seconds
might
have
unforseen
consequences
like
thirds
drinkability
a
wonderful
sipper
by
the
fire
notes
its
like
liquid
love
i
need
to
stock
up
on
this
one
i
had
this
long
ago
when
it
was
st
sixtus
and
i
remember
the
st
sixtus
being
better
but
that
doesnt
seem
possible
ive
tried
to
be
constructive
but
this
beer
won
me
over
i
feel
spoiled
drinking
it
hoowah
pours
a
beautiful
hazy
brown
body
with
mahogany
red
highlights
and
a
creamy
head
gorgeous
lacing
aromas
of
cloves
spices
fruit
and
malt
taste
was
amazing
cloves
rich
sugar
dark
fruits
tremendous
malt
backbone
and
hops
to
balance
alcohol
is
hidden
behind
the
sweetness
and
phenols
smooth
and
full
bodied
creamy
as
anything
ive
ever
had
great
beer
to
sip
after
dinner
the
beer
pours
a
deep
dark
brownblack
color
with
a
thick
frothy
offwhite
head
that
slowly
fades
to
lacing
the
aroma
is
great
it
has
a
nice
malty
scent
with
a
fruity
belgian
yeast
aroma
it
boasts
of
pale
and
crystal
malts
very
complex
the
taste
is
good
it
has
a
very
smooth
and
rich
malty
flavor
that
goes
down
easy
and
finishes
warm
and
fruity
the
mouthfeel
is
fine
it
is
a
full
bodied
beer
with
adequate
carbonation
this
is
a
very
enjoyable
brew
with
loads
of
flavor
and
aroma
a
good
drinker
this
is
an
awesomely
constructed
beer
which
is
all
about
balance
and
perfection
which
it
nearly
achieves
33cl
bottle
i
finally
got
around
to
trying
one
of
these
it
pours
a
cloudy
brown
color
there
was
some
offwhite
head
to
it
which
died
down
fairly
rapidly
the
aroma
was
not
quite
as
strong
as
i
would
have
expected
very
pleasant
but
a
hair
lighter
the
aroma
is
rich
and
complicated
there
are
many
kinds
of
fruits
in
the
mix
but
the
complexity
is
making
it
hard
for
determining
individual
notes
the
taste
is
superb
a
complicated
sweetness
with
a
tart
underlying
flavor
fruits
caramel
heaven
superb
easily
the
best
belgian
i
have
had
tremendous
one
i
will
certainly
go
back
to
for
special
occasions
this
is
a
very
delicious
and
highly
drinkable
beer
at
8
99
for
a
750ml
bottle
an
excellent
value
i
plan
to
stock
up
on
this
one
find
it
buy
it
enjoy
it
treat
it
with
respect
probably
my
1020th
bottle
lifetime
of
this
stuff
and
i
will
not
stop
consuming
it
never
tried
it
or
westy
12
aged
significantly
and
that
will
be
my
next
step
in
its
appreciation
look
forward
to
it
as
i
watched
it
fall
from
bottle
to
glass
it
was
brown
but
it
sits
a
very
dark
deep
brown
almost
black
in
the
glass
the
greatest
highlight
of
this
beer
for
me
was
watching
the
head
sit
a
good
thumbs
liength
above
the
top
of
the
glass
with
out
any
of
it
running
down
the
sides
it
jsut
sat
there
happy
as
could
be
pillowing
above
the
glass
providing
quite
a
sight
it
has
a
murky
brown
color
as
it
lessens
in
the
glass
and
more
light
is
allowed
to
pass
through
i
smell
grass
malty
sweetness
pepper
alcohol
and
pears
tastespeppery
wet
horsblanket
taste
that
is
oh
so
popular
this
year
wiht
an
aftertaste
of
booze
and
pepper
bubbly
at
first
which
seems
to
fade
somewhat
quickly
perhaps
i
swirled
it
in
the
glass
to
many
times
also
hints
of
fruit
peas
current
depnding
on
the
sip
and
grassy
ntoes
blending
together
with
the
horse
blanket
taste
surprisingly
light
in
the
mouth
and
very
drinkable
but
as
i
have
been
rereading
some
of
my
reviews
lately
i
think
everything
is
drinkable
it
seems
that
i
would
almost
always
take
another
but
this
doesnt
lend
much
in
the
way
of
the
10
abv
or
overbearing
tastes
of
some
belgians
i
had
this
ale
on
tap
at
the
map
room
in
chicago
recently
what
i
anticipated
before
hand
was
enhanced
two
fold
after
tasting
this
brew
it
was
served
in
the
proper
brewery
glass
and
had
such
a
nice
head
on
it
that
i
had
to
look
at
it
for
a
while
before
finally
lifting
the
glass
for
a
sip
presentation
is
really
important
to
fulfilling
desire
and
i
think
that
this
was
one
of
the
best
looking
beers
i
have
had
served
to
me
ever
when
i
took
that
first
sip
i
knew
that
this
was
something
to
be
savored
for
a
while
nice
rounded
malt
sweetness
and
smooth
strength
creamy
sweet
soft
and
chewy
nice
lingering
aftertaste
like
sucking
on
a
piece
of
candy
wow
no
problem
drinking
several
of
these
not
even
a
little
final
thought
belgian
ales
are
still
new
to
me
but
through
time
i
may
appreciate
them
more
and
review
this
one
again
big
ups
to
the
prior
8
from
this
brewery
humm
always
a
good
beer
and
my
closer
for
tonight
had
quiet
some
different
styles
today
but
quadruppel
is
always
something
else
presance
is
more
then
ok
and
head
is
overwelming
staying
long
smell
of
ripe
fruit
apricot
and
flowers
do
you
remind
that
this
is
from
near
westvleteren
nice
combination
of
everything
that
your
tung
nose
can
detect
in
this
brew
sweetfruity
fullmalty
and
a
subtile
bitter
seem
to
dominate
so
just
to
say
what
a
mouthfull
there
is
in
every
tiny
litle
sip
one
of
the
better
beers
you
can
get
in
belgium
one
thats
in
my
cellar
permantly
however
once
in
a
while
a
botle
gets
renewed
what
a
pleasance
this
is
a
pretty
strong
belgian
ale
the
lacing
on
this
is
excellent
a
very
dark
brown
when
held
up
to
the
light
it
barely
passes
through
very
dark
the
smell
has
hints
of
green
apple
very
sweet
smelling
the
taste
contained
a
variety
of
flavors
at
first
a
malty
nutty
taste
the
aftertaste
contained
hints
of
bannanas
very
foamy
feeling
in
your
mouth
quite
filling
very
good
try
for
anyone
interested
in
trying
some
of
the
best
of
the
best
would
highly
recommend
very
drinkable
on
a
cool
night
when
something
special
is
called
for
drinkability
is
perfect
for
this
type
of
style
look
out
for
the
ten
percent
in
tradition
of
the
holy
bible
i
hereby
damn
johns
grocery
in
iowa
city
for
tempting
me
with
this
forbidden
fruit
anything
as
good
as
a
fine
belgian
beer
has
got
to
be
a
sin
had
this
on
tap
at
redbones
the
fine
somerville
establishment
very
reasonably
priced
i
might
add
the
body
was
a
dark
caramel
brown
with
little
head
perhaps
it
dissipated
as
it
was
filled
to
the
brim
the
nose
is
figgy
andor
raisin
nice
my
first
thought
is
wow
what
a
taste
explosion
then
i
immediately
notice
the
syrupy
full
mouthfeel
this
is
quite
obviously
a
world
class
beer
i
find
there
are
a
bunch
of
flavors
vying
for
number
one
here
brandyraisinfigand
a
candy
sweetness
the
finish
is
fantastic
wonderfully
quenching
with
an
incredible
penetrating
sweetness
that
forever
lingers
tremendous
beer
i
can
see
what
all
the
fuss
is
about
wow
this
beer
tastes
good
but
i
wasnt
in
the
mood
for
it
at
all
come
to
think
of
it
i
havent
been
in
the
mood
for
maltyandnothoppy
beer
in
a
while
in
time
when
i
drift
back
over
to
the
other
end
of
the
spectrum
ill
be
enjoying
the
heck
out
of
some
st
bernardus
abt12
note
also
its
damn
drinkable
for
a
quadrupel
on
tap
gotta
love
the
blind
tiger
this
gem
poured
dark
brown
and
murky
minimal
head
but
leaves
well
developed
lacing
multiple
layers
of
flavor
going
on
here
fruity
malty
yeasty
complex
and
intriguing
warrming
but
not
overpowering
in
strength
body
or
flavor
the
genius
here
is
that
its
so
drinkable
seek
out
savor
and
enjoy
im
am
forevever
in
debt
to
a
great
man
gclarkage
thank
you
my
friend
i
owe
you
for
this
one
tastes
and
smells
are
variables
quickly
during
the
tasting
pours
a
cloudy
muddy
mahogany
great
nose
big
cookie
doughalso
some
sweet
fruits
perhaps
watermelon
also
black
cherries
plums
a
hint
of
molasses
as
well
body
is
rich
and
eloquent
spicy
alcohol
evident
but
it
fits
nicely
with
the
rich
flavors
carbonation
is
jacked
up
that
fits
nicely
too
flavors
are
sweet
dark
fruit
maltiness
acented
wit
ha
candy
sugar
like
sweetness
finishes
creamy
and
smooth
as
i
drink
this
i
realize
this
is
the
big
dog
this
is
a
true
heavy
hitter
i
am
in
possession
of
a
fantastic
beverage
better
than
any
of
the
westy
stuff
ive
had
which
is
saying
something
and
the
best
of
the
3
ive
had
from
this
brewery
this
is
a
gobsmackingly
delicious
brew
quite
possibly
the
best
ive
ever
had
if
you
get
the
chance
to
try
it
and
dont
youll
regret
it
for
a
beer
with
the
abv
of
10
this
is
extremely
smooth
this
may
not
be
the
greatest
belgian
i
have
tasted
but
it
holds
its
own
as
a
very
solid
beer
in
every
single
category
when
you
go
to
tally
up
your
scores
good
stuff
pours
very
nicely
and
the
head
hangs
on
its
lacey
and
bubbly
not
chunky
or
rocky
smell
and
color
are
super
and
the
taste
is
out
of
this
world
you
get
the
dark
roasted
coffee
the
nutty
and
buttery
notes
the
dark
chocolate
the
works
this
is
beer
that
has
depth
and
complexity
highly
recommended
this
gem
of
a
beer
pours
a
dark
cloudy
brown
so
dark
and
thick
you
cant
see
light
through
it
and
produces
a
huge
foamy
head
which
goes
down
slowly
leaving
some
lacing
its
aroma
contains
hints
of
spice
cherries
and
a
red
wine
character
which
i
liken
to
a
fine
merlot
the
taste
was
the
best
part
of
this
beer
by
far
at
first
you
are
introduced
to
a
rich
coffee
and
chocolate
flavor
which
later
yields
to
fruitiness
there
are
also
hints
of
light
spicing
and
roasted
malt
which
comes
towards
the
end
in
the
mouth
this
beer
had
the
texture
and
richness
of
good
coffee
at
the
same
time
it
was
creamy
and
smooth
the
aftertaste
left
a
nice
thick
coating
on
the
mouth
the
only
thing
i
didnt
like
about
this
beer
was
a
sense
of
grittiness
in
the
front
of
the
mouth
in
the
aftertaste
otherwise
this
offering
was
probably
the
best
ive
sampled
so
far
id
definitely
have
another
the
color
of
this
belgium
trappist
was
medium
dark
brown
with
a
fair
amount
of
light
tan
foam
and
no
lace
the
smell
of
fruit
and
malts
with
a
hint
of
yeast
filled
the
nose
the
taste
had
a
soft
fruitiness
with
just
a
touch
of
a
sweetsourness
to
balance
out
this
belgium
abbey
ale
the
balance
of
malts
hops
and
yeast
has
made
this
brown
ale
a
very
pleasant
trappist
i
am
indebted
to
spiledriver
for
having
this
gem
available
ontap
simply
stellar
murky
brown
in
color
with
a
foamy
tan
head
the
aroma
is
malty
and
bready
with
a
dark
fruit
smell
the
flavor
is
bready
malt
and
alcoholic
it
has
a
fruity
boozy
flavor
in
the
finish
it
has
a
nice
sweetness
throughout
not
overpowering
but
just
right
it
is
a
bit
winelike
in
the
flavor
as
well
it
is
fullbodied
and
warming
you
know
this
one
is
strong
from
the
get
go
i
very
nice
belgian
and
i
am
sure
i
will
visit
her
over
and
over
again
a
definite
must
try
served
on
draft
in
a
st
bernardus
chalice
a
lovely
deep
mahogany
body
with
a
rocky
cream
head
which
stayed
throughout
the
entire
long
drink
and
left
persistent
lacing
on
the
glass
hypnotic
dark
fruit
and
spicy
alcohol
aromas
which
were
nearly
intoxicating
by
themselves
fantastically
complex
dark
fruit
and
spice
flavors
the
alcohol
comes
through
quite
clearly
but
is
carefully
blended
with
the
fruits
and
spices
so
that
a
dark
mellow
and
delicious
vinous
quality
ensues
very
rounded
and
creamy
body
more
creamy
and
smooth
than
the
bottled
version
very
strong
but
surprisingly
easydrinking
on
draft
perhaps
because
its
smoother
than
the
the
bottled
variant
50
cl
bottle
a
large
alcohol
presence
follows
in
the
warming
contributed
from
this
beer
it
doesnt
sneak
up
on
you
it
smacks
you
in
the
face
and
dares
you
to
drink
more
this
is
probably
the
closest
beer
to
barleywine
that
i
would
consider
drinkable
this
was
just
superb
ill
be
meeting
more
of
these
taste
spicy
with
an
alcohol
bite
sour
cherries
cloaked
in
brandy
tastes
like
a
ripe
yellow
fruitcake
with
dried
sour
cherries
and
almonds
and
almond
extract
and
candied
citrus
peels
nice
chewy
semolina
cake
flavors
soaked
in
litebrown
sugar
simple
syrup
and
a
touch
of
brandy
i
shouldnt
be
allowed
to
drink
this
bottle
this
fast
the
flavor
was
all
about
malt
caramel
and
vinous
though
it
hid
the
alcohol
well
though
full
bodied
in
the
mouth
and
dangerously
drinkable
nothing
really
special
emerged
until
the
end
as
it
warmed
up
i
really
liked
the
butterscotch
tones
with
shades
of
almond
roca
that
developed
in
the
bottom
should
have
kept
my
hands
around
the
glass
longer
a
thick
creamywhite
head
sits
atop
a
murky
brown
liquid
the
head
is
stable
and
constantseemingly
able
to
float
on
top
forever
thick
rocks
of
lace
dot
the
glass
if
youre
anywhere
near
the
glass
the
aroma
of
spice
yeast
fruit
and
alcohol
are
sure
to
hit
you
it
makes
me
think
of
blackberries
and
cherries
soaked
in
alcohol
intense
alcohol
warming
the
taste
is
spice
and
candy
smooth
substantial
and
relaxing
are
words
to
describe
this
beer
the
essence
of
a
contemplative
brew
mouthfeel
is
good
as
well
this
has
a
good
body
to
it
but
just
a
tad
too
much
carbonation
for
my
taste
the
drinkability
is
excellent
as
each
sip
seems
different
from
the
last
and
it
keeps
you
wanting
to
come
back
for
more
a
very
good
brew
that
i
hope
to
try
on
tap
sometime
as
well
seek
this
one
out
prosit
a
sheer
monster
this
is
a
beer
you
should
not
pass
up

with
a
fluffy

earthy
bark
and

fig

cinnamon
ginger

luxurious

heavy
malt
and
fine
carbonation
give
a
creamy
mouthfeel
slightly
malty
sweet
but
subtle
fruity
qualities
and
a
fine
yeastiness
compact
the
overall
impression
of
the
taste
into
a
fever
pitch
this
beer
is
about
as
close
as
you
might
get
to
a
trappist
without
it
being
labeled
as
such
its
impression
lasts
throughout
the
duration
of
the
drinking
experience
abv
seems
hidden
well
amongst
its
complexity
i
cetainly
give
this
beer
high
marks
for
drinkablity
which
is
both
complimentary
and
hypothetical
as
the
10
abv
demands
that
this
beer
be
consumed
in
moderation
or
suffer
the
consequences
poured
a
murky
rootbeer
brown
creamy
rocky
head
and
spicy
aroma
both
yeast
and
alcohol
spicy
on
the
tongue
with
an
unusual
dark
flavor
lurking
in
the
background
not
soy
sauce
but
something
akin
to
that
in
the
manner
of
a
dark
fermented
flavor
but
more
tannic
like
flavors
leached
from
a
wooden
ageing
cask
obviously
couldnt
put
my
finger
on
it
but
it
was
both
interesting
and
pleasant
other
dark
flavors
from
overripe
orchard
fruit
and
a
touch
of
prune
one
of
the
best
of
the
style
in
my
humble
opinon
whats
not
to
love
about
st
bernardus
this
is
the
gemstone
of
their
line
in
my
opinion
this
is
a
great
brew
that
lives
up
to
its
reputation
when
poured
the
beer
looked
a
bit
messed
up
but
it
became
greatly
silky
after
letting
it
on
its
own
for
a
few
seconds
i
can
see
me
in
the
body
which
mades
me
think
it
is
opaque
the
head
doesnt
disappear
until
the
beer
is
drunk
nice
the
smell
is
partly
reminiscent
of
the
prior
8
light
hints
of
red
fruits
some
peanut
butter
and
a
grassy
grapefruit
and
chocolate
aspect
the
taste
is
a
bit
nutty
and
shows
interesting
notes
of
almost
burnt
caramel
and
chocolate
with
deep
wooden
notes
lightly
fruity
with
some
sweetness
mouthfeel
is
amazing
an
incredible
smoothness
and
creaminess
very
full
and
round
in
the
mouth
almost
as
drinkable
as
a
10
beer
can
be
the
real
experience
is
the
mouthfeel
ng
this
beer
poured
dark
and
lovely
with
a
tan
head
with
wierd
brown
flecks
the
nose
is
dank
abbeys
and
dried
fruit
the
taste
is
pure
heaven
as
all
those
subtle
esters
that
make
up
belgian
strong
ales
are
blended
in
such
a
way
that
the
whole
is
greater
than
the
parts
like
westy
12
and
rochefort
10
this
is
a
beer
to
contemplate
and
sip
have
a
slice
of
strong
cheese
and
enjoy
buddy
at
the
table
who
tends
to
try
everything
i
get
said
he
noticed
saki
tastes
i
dont
know
that
i
have
ever
had
saki
so
i
will
just
have
to
take
his
word
on
that
one
he
did
enjoy
it
enough
to
grab
a
glass
for
himself
though
comments
this
reminded
me
quite
a
bit
of
the
westy
12
while
its
flavors
are
very
good
and
extremely
well
blended
for
me
there
was
not
as
much
interaction
between
the
flavors
as
compared
to
for
example
the
malheur
12
or
the
rochefort
10
perhaps
this
really
isnt
the
case
for
other
people
and
its
just
how
my
taste
buds
respond
to
these
different
quadrupels
but
i
prefer
the
various
flavors
to
come
through
over
time
as
opposed
to
all
at
once
therefore
as
of
this
moment
i
prefer
the
malheur
12
and
rochefort
10
over
the
st
bernardus
abt
12
and
the
westy
12
however
it
is
an
enjoyable
beer
nevertheless
very
nice
beer
here
at
three
and
a
half
bucks
a
bottle
not
something
im
gonna
stock
my
fridge
with
but
probably
something
ill
keep
around
for
the
flavor
and
feel
itself
i
think
this
one
is
a
very
drinkable
beer
but
not
something
youd
probably
want
to
drink
one
after
another
of
this
was
a
good
solid
beer
not
a
mindblowing
experience
but
very
enjoyable
the
alcohol
is
warming
but
a
bit
strong
the
taste
is
a
glorified
quad
with
everything
youd
expect
but
so
much
better
the
taste
is
malty
and
chewy
with
cloves
sugar
cane
an
licorice
very
good
brew
bottle
poured
a
slightly
hazy
brown
colored
beer
with
what
can
only
be
describe
as
huge
foamy
super
resistant
head
do
i
need
to
mention
perfect
carbonation
aroma
is
quite
complex
with
some
great
roastiness
and
some
strange
mix
of
spices
great
roasty
taste
with
a
side
of
spiced
plums
i
could
not
detect
any
alcohol
which
is
quite
a
wonder
at
10
wow
im
now
glad
i
bought
quite
a
few
so
that
i
can
cellar
some
overall
a
worldclass
dark
belgian
ale
i
could
drink
this
all
the
time
and
never
tire
of
it
simply
a
magnificent
beer
for
belgian
lovers
pineapple
and
lime
fruit
abound
in
fashion
with
the
st
bernardus
tripel
alcoholic
donuts
soaked
in
tea
and
carrot
cake
finish
it
all
off
what
notes
this
beer
should
be
taken
out
of
the
fridge
for
a
while
before
consuming
its
so
much
better
just
a
few
degrees
below
room
temp
a
magnificent
creation
and
as
close
to
the
perfect
beer
as
ive
ever
tasted
drink
it
know
it
love
it
this
has
been
in
the
fridge
a
bit
and
i
thought
tonite
i
need
to
do
some
cleaning
so
here
goes
upon
the
initial
pour
i
got
some
aromas
i
thought
were
a
bit
off
but
as
the
glass
warms
it
smooths
out
a
bit
initial
impresiion
is
of
dark
dark
toffee
color
topped
with
a
latte
colored
head
the
aroma
i
am
still
picking
up
an
earthy
almost
cocoa
powder
note
theres
some
alcohol
hanging
out
alongside
the
taste
helps
out
quite
a
bit
however
cocoa
powder
dark
fruit
some
spiceyness
in
the
finish
light
but
still
medium
mouthfeel
a
nice
treat
but
not
one
i
will
go
for
that
often
while
very
good
perhaps
this
one
would
benefit
from
some
aging
looks
like
the
bottle
is
telling
me
that
it
would
be
good
till
2005
maybe
i
should
have
saved
it
till
then
i
am
looking
for
a
bit
more
blend
and
meld
in
the
flavor
as
with
all
abby
ales
this
poured
with
a
big
thick
head
there
was
a
distinct
lace
after
a
brief
period
that
stayed
with
the
glass
throughout
the
entire
tasting
the
color
was
a
deep
chocolate
brown
the
aroma
is
of
spice
and
candy
quite
surprising
actually
the
taste
has
a
hint
of
the
candy
present
in
the
nose
with
some
roasted
grain
up
front
on
the
back
you
get
a
subtle
impression
of
the
alcohol
and
a
mild
lingering
bitterness
the
mouthfeel
is
medium
not
too
heavy
the
drinkability
is
good
i
could
have
a
few
more
of
these
and
will
i
have
3
more
in
the
fridge
then
the
first
taste
the
alcohol
hit
prematurely
and
the
beer
lay
flat
on
my
tongue
like
a
bad
kisser
the
bananas
in
the
nose
did
not
ever
hit
the
palate
the
finish
was
almost
foul
causing
me
to
make
a
bit
of
an
onion
smelling
face
with
each
sip
some
may
call
blasphome
sp
but
i
failed
to
finish
the
beer
i
may
blow
another
4
00
on
this
beer
but
only
on
sheer
curiosity
because
the
beers
reputation
was
not
met
and
perhaps
i
had
a
bad
bottle
i
will
be
more
than
happy
to
post
a
better
review
if
this
beer
makes
a
better
showing
very
nice
roasted
brown
color
light
milk
chocolate
colored
head
which
stays
with
the
full
glass
and
is
creamy
and
thick
alcohol
jumps
out
at
you
and
covers
the
palate
nice
blend
of
chocolate
malt
which
quickly
smoothes
out
the
alcohol
bite
the
finish
leaves
a
tingle
on
the
tongue
which
is
a
lasting
reminder
of
a
great
drink
powerful
and
great
tasting
beer
this
poured
out
a
dark
thick
opaque
brown
color
with
a
good
sized
beige
head
that
has
great
retention
this
also
left
a
wonderful
coating
of
lace
around
the
glass
as
it
was
consumed
big
complex
aroma
here
with
dark
sweet
fruit
malts
standing
out
the
most
with
notes
of
alcohol
some
spice
and
yeast
there
is
more
going
on
than
that
but
i
am
unable
to
tell
exactly
what
the
wonderful
scents
are
i
will
defiantly
need
to
get
a
few
more
of
these
to
enjoy
and
analyze
up
front
with
the
taste
is
sweet
fruity
malt
flavors
mingling
with
a
bit
of
spice
the
taste
is
very
smooth
and
it
defiantly
warms
you
up
a
good
deal
mouthfeel
is
full
and
creamy
with
excellent
carbonation
and
a
dry
finish
basically
perfect
drinkability
is
only
hindered
by
ones
tolerance
for
10
beers
besides
that
its
so
smooth
and
delicious
i
could
try
and
drink
this
all
day
excellent
beer
that
is
recommended
to
everyone
a
candy
texture
and
nutmeg
on
the
palate
note
a
very
good
beer
at
a
good
price

chicago
beer
is
good
happy
beering
blood
red
pour
with
a
beautiful
towering
foamy
head
fed
by
an
onrush
of
ultra
fine
bubbles
that
are
like
champagne
the
head
is
immortal
the
aroma
is
sweet
cherries
with
the
uniquely
earthy
belgian
yeast
strain
the
taste
at
first
sip
is
an
explosively
spicy
alcohol
after
that
initial
attack
other
flavors
start
to
emerge
the
most
notable
of
these
is
a
lingering
hop
bitterness
that
is
much
stronger
than
most
other
beers
that
fall
under
the
broad
umbrella
of
belgian
styles
the
bitterness
is
not
overpowering
in
any
way
and
allows
the
fruitiness
of
the
malt
to
open
up
in
the
background
i
imagine
as
this
fresh
beer
settles
down
the
character
would
become
more
malty
and
complex
and
thanks
to
the
new
georgia
law
allowing
this
elixir
to
enter
our
fair
state
i
can
find
out
how
it
will
age
without
much
problem
this
beer
packs
a
heck
of
a
punch
at
10
abv
after
the
330
ml
bottle
is
downed
there
is
a
fire
in
the
belly
that
radiates
out
to
the
extremities
very
drinkable
even
at
this
potency
i
will
be
having
more
overall
this
is
very
damn
good
im
glad
ive
aged
it
but
i
would
also
like
to
try
it
a
little
fresher
than
this
id
have
to
say
that
this
bottle
is
damn
near
2
years
old
date
worn
off
of
the
cage
but
i
recall
it
being
02
very
impressed
cant
wait
to
have
the
opportunity
to
have
this
again
it
is
amazing
how
smooth
this
beer
is
i
had
a
very
difficult
time
distinguishing
any
individual
flavor
in
this
beer
and
not
because
it
was
crafted
blandly
it
is
profound
how
complex
and
well
balanced
the
flavors
are
in
this
beer
i
kept
guessing
at
each
sip
when
the
beer
was
gone
i
still
hadnt
written
anything
substantial
as
to
the
elements
of
the
flavor
its
just
a
perfect
smooth
balanced
taste
i
had
a
hard
time
drinking
it
slowly
the
cork
shot
off
at
about
50
mph
when
i
removed
the
cage
good
thing
i
didnt
have
my
head
over
the
bottle
it
poured
a
reddish
brown
color
with
a
medium
sizd
off
white
head
and
nice
lacing
aroma
of
banana
clove
grapes
and
raisins
while
the
taste
is
very
strong
in
the
dark
fruit
department
alcohol
is
also
slightly
noticeable
and
it
had
a
carbonated
mouthfeel
fruitier
than
the
westy
12
and
i
enjoy
that
one
better
you
certainly
couldnt
drink
many
of
these
id
probably
only
have
one
however
it
is
an
enjoying
sipper
for
that
one
was
definitely
worth
trying
and
im
not
huge
on
belgians
in
general
a
lively
brown
pour
with
a
medium
head
the
nose
is
semisweet
with
a
touch
of
tartness
and
light
spice
medium
bodied
with
hints
of
overripened
fruit
such
as
plum
and
raisin
theres
a
brown
sugar
sweetness
and
a
dry
finish
accompanied
by
woody
notes
very
nice
mouthfeel
both
lively
and
fresh
and
a
little
alcohol
kick
on
the
finish
a
very
very
good
beer
reddish
brown
colored
with
orangey
highlights
and
unappetizing
dark
chunks
of
stuff
suspended
and
floating
head
rises
up
high
and
is
a
color
of
dark
beige
with
tight
bubbles
that
make
noise
as
they
pop
and
recede
a
thin
cap
of
lace
is
left
on
top
with
sheets
of
bubbly
film
rising
up
the
edges
of
the
glass
aroma
is
sweet
and
fruity
of
fig
and
raisin
and
currant
some
spice
and
orange
peel
as
well
and
a
bit
of
clove
also
i
detect
some
of
the
alcohol
in
the
nose
mouthfeel
is
full
and
creamy
flavor
is
rich
and
sweet
not
cloying
but
close
to
it
there
is
caramel
and
toffee
sweet
cinnamon
and
plum
and
a
bit
of
alcohol
in
the
finish
no
strong
yeast
flavors
but
a
little
too
rich
to
be
very
drinkable
for
me
super
drinkable
at
5
a
bottle
it
could
get
to
be
an
expensive
habit
the
taste
is
of
an
apple
pie
or
apple
cider
sweet
with
the
bitterness
of
apples
the
sweetness
of
caramel
the
spiciness
gives
it
the
little
bite
raisins
are
also
a
strong
flavor
this
is
one
of
the
most
perfect
dessert
beers
ever
mouth
is
sweet
and
sticky
really
smooth
for
10
abv
this
is
excellent
but
could
be
aged
just
a
bit
to
blend
the
alcohol
flavors
better
lived
up
to
the
hype
for
me
mouth
feel
is
what
i
would
consider
to
be
the
lowest
ranking
part
of
the
beer
it
is
not
bad
but
doesnt
match
up
to
the
rest
of
the
beer
good
carbonation
that
glides
around
the
mouth
but
the
beer
is
just
the
slightest
bit
punishing
on
the
tounge
the
alcohol
digs
in
quite
a
bit
regardless
this
beer
is
exceptionally
delicious
and
makes
a
good
night
on
its
own
update
two
ive
had
a
number
of
these
now
and
theyve
ranged
from
amazing
to
flat
and
stale
this
beer
is
hit
or
miss
if
you
get
a
good
youve
got
one
of
the
best
beers
on
earth
i
enjoyed
this
brew
but
ive
had
better
from
the
same
style
grimbergen
immediately
comes
to
mind
the
subtle
fusels
and
oxidized
ruddy
middle
hurt
its
drinkability
as
it
warms
it
becomes
a
much
better
beer
7
3
years
later
and
just
yeasty
and
sweetish
drinkability
man
i
need
to
slow
down
and
enjoy
this
work
of
brewery
art
it
is
a
fantastic
abbey
ale
and
a
must
for
all
to
try
its
a
great
beer
theres
not
much
question
about
that
this
is
a
beer
of
great
artistry
and
poise
with
a
judicious
balance
of
lush
malty
sweetness
and
muscular
verve
im
beginning
to
think
these
monks
are
really
onto
something
i
wonder
if
i
might
look
good
in
a
brown
robe
finally
got
myself
a
bottle
of
this
this
beer
is
amazing
as
soon
as
the
brew
hit
my
crystal
goblet
all
i
said
was
oh
damn
as
a
frothy
tan
head
rose
to
the
top
excellent
lacing
on
the
glasss
what
a
great
smell
complex
malts
with
fruity
hints
the
taste
is
so
sweet
and
smooth
very
drinkable
imo
the
10abv
is
very
suddle
this
may
be
one
of
the
best
beers
ive
ever
tried
thanks
to
prostman
for
the
samples
drinkability
who
cares
if
this
is
10
if
i
could
id
bring
them
one
after
another
all
evening
really
one
of
the
most
profound
beers
ive
had
the
pleasure
of
tasting
i
wish
they
were
less
expensive
here
in
the
u
s
awesome
this
beer
is
for
special
occasions
and
worth
it
enjoy
its
a
keeper
this
is
an
excellent
and
very
drinkable
brew
the
only
reason
i
would
not
drink
more
than
one
i
would
rather
save
it
for
a
better
occasion
beautiful
pour
two
fingered
head
great
lacing
smells
and
tastes
exquisite
smooth
and
complex
almost
like
a
fine
wine
the
box
says
bringing
heavenly
nectar
within
reach
well
put
this
beer
is
heavenly
i
loved
this
beer
i
bought
a
four
pack
and
it
set
me
back
about
15
bucks
but
i
could
drink
this
all
day
long
drinkability
has
to
be
slightly
graded
down
in
that
its
10abv
making
this
a
session
beer
could
land
you
in
serious
trouble
but
god
it
goes
down
so
easy
pours

beautifully
deep

tends

it
really
is
one
of
the
best
belgians
i
have
had
really
a
nice
beer
indeed
well
worth
seeking
out
imho
this
is
a
truly
great
beer
a
great
balance
of
desirable
characteristics
not
overwhelming
i
feel
unqualified
to
give
it
the
great
review
it
deserves
this
dark
ruby
brown
beer
has
an
enormous
rocky
head
and
lots
of
flavor
its
aroma
is
spicy
fruity
and
yeasty
while
it
is
very
complex
in
taste
anise
cinnamon
prune
fig
and
raisin
are
just
some
of
the
flavors
present
it
finishes
with
a
slight
dry
spiciness
a
great
beer
worth
seeking
out
gotta
love
the
monk
on
the
label
after
drinking
this
youll
have
a
smile
on
your
face
just
like
that
monk
does
poured
out
a
light
muddy
brown
with
quite
a
bit
of
carbonation
in
this
beer
smell
was
mostly
matls
and
dark
fruits
with
an
ever
so
sight
wiff
of
alochol
taste
was
extremely
complex
fruit
hits
the
palate
first
with
some
malts
and
finishes
with
a
nutty
aftertaste
and
a
little
dry
but
goes
down
so
easy
and
its
so
smooth
im
so
glad
my
local
store
got
this
beer
finally
just
an
awesome
beer
straight
into
a
chimay
chalice
this

yeasty
brown

pure

along
with

it

brown
taste
is
candi
sugar
brown
chocolate
hugely
malty
but
even
more
so
intensively
yeasty
with
a
bit
of
bananas
prunes
and
plums
and
a
light
restrained
alcohol
bite
body
is
medium
and
creamy
wow
this
is
so
yeasty
i
wouldnt
expect
this
from
myself
but
maybe
too
much
for
its
own
good
a
very
generous
and
potent
complex
beer
nevertheless
and
i
cant
wait
to
rerate
from
a
750
of
all
the
qualities
that
stand
out
in
a
big
beer
smoothness
is
very
often
overlooked
but
not
in
this
case
simply
its
a
smooth
blend
of
sweet
and
savory
balance
the
flavor
is
all
i
want
it
to
be
keeping
ones
attention
with
the
interplay
between
all
the
individual
pieces
the
high
abv
is
well
mitigated
by
everything
else
this
excellent
ale
has
to
offer
though
it
does
raise
a
wisely
heeded
flag
of
caution
anyway
id
likely
stop
at
one
big
bottle
because
with
anything
this
good
you
should
want
to
be
able
to
savor
fully
and
consciously
every
sip
you
take
from
the
familiar
smiling
monk

with
a
deep

when
held
up
to
a
light
the
beer
turns
a
nice
amber
color
around
the
edges
the
smell
is
amazing
this
has
to
be
one
of
my
favorite
smelling
beers
a
malty
raisin
sweetness
rises
from
the
glass
this
is
one
enjoyable
beer
to
drink
there
are
a
lot
of
flavors
present
with
some
bold
fruit
tastes
evident
at
first
before
gently
yielding
to
a
pleasant
maltiness
it
is
very
hard
to
taste
any
alcohol
even
as
the
beer
warms
to
room
temperature
the
mouthfeel
is
very
smooth
and
creamy
which
lends
to
this
beers
incredible
drinkability
this
is
one
of
my
favorite
beers
and
definitely
worth
a
try
the
taste
is
however
its
disappointing
factor
because
the
complexity
of
its
fruityness
is
opaqued
by
its
intense
bitter
malty
feel
that
approach
it
more
to
a
kwak
like
brew
than
a
top
notch
dark
belgian
the
body
is
also
a
little
weak
for
the
style
not
dense
enough
possibly
the
best
beer
ive
ever
had
im
sure
this
is
expensive
in
the
u
s
although
i
picked
up
a
bottle
here
in
paris
for
only
2
30
it
doesnt
really
matter
because
its
worth
every
cent
incredibly
complex
incredibly
drinkable

the
closest
to
a
perfect
beer
ive
ever
had
first
sip
reveals
a
very
creamy
texture
and
mild
carbonation
flavor
is
fruity
sweet
cherry
pear
plum
up
from
and
fades
to
a
big
tangy
hit
of
yeastiness
finish
is
peppery
and
i
get
some
alcohol
warming
on
the
way
down
very
tasty
brew
and
complex
even
with
the
warming
factor
this
beer
is
very
easy
to
drink
drinkability
pretty
darn
exquisite
i
could
see
myself
having
a
few
more
of
these
and
the
price
kicks
ass
not
quite
perfect
but
bloody
hell
its
really
chuffin
close
to
it
a
dark
ruby
color
with
a
very
thick
offwhite
head
leaves
behind
a
nice
lacing
and
adds
a
beautiful
looking
brew
smells
of
dark
malts
strong
spices
and
a
fruitiness
silky
smooth
blend
of
spices
cloves
come
to
mind
fruit
flavors
and
strong
malts
the
alcohol
isnt
overally
noticable
and
will
sneak
up
on
you
aftertaste
is
a
lingering
fruity
taste
with
that
strong
feeling
a
smooth
creamy
beer
great
beer
for
the
style
this
is
something
ill
be
looking
for
again
redbrown
with
a
thick
tan
head
in
my
chimay
chalice
bready
fruity
aroma
taste
is
sweet
yeasty
and
sour
with
some
fruit
notes
and
a
dry
and
slightly
bitter
finish
perhaps
due
to
the
high
level
of
carbonation
very
light
on
the
palate
and
extremely
drinkable
maybe
a
little
bit
of
smokiness
as
the
beer
warms
some
cloves
too
an
excellent
complex
and
beautiful
beer
served
from
an
11
2
oz
bottle
in
a
duvel
tulip
upon
pouring
a
stiff
rocky
tan
head
formed
which
was
decorated
with
nutmeg
colored
particles
when
the
head
receded
an
intricate
lacing
pattern
was
left
behind
the
dark
ruddybrown
beer
was
very
cloudy
and
riddled
with
particulates
the
sharp
nose
was
malty
and
quite
fruity
with
notes
of
cherry
raisin
and
coconut
with
a
wisp
of
alcohol
sneaking
through
the
fullbodied
and
slighty
fluffy
beer
was
a
delight
for
the
taste
buds
the
fantastic
slightly
tart
malt
backbone
faintly
resembled
a
flemish
brown
and
was
accompanied
by
notes
of
cherry
cinnamon
and
banana
with
a
fairly
dry
finish
the
collection
strength
and
balance
of
flavors
was
perfection
no
wonder
why
the
fellow
on
the
bottle
is
so
happy
this
beer
poured
a
dark
hazy
brown
looked
like
fresh
apple
cider
but
with
a
giant
tan
head
that
would
not
go
down
i
had
to
wait
almost
5
mins
before
i
could
take
a
sip
but
it
was
so
worth
the
wait
the
smell
was
sweet
and
malty
very
fruity
especially
banana
but
not
real
banana
like
the
banana
flavor
of
banana
gum
or
ice
cream
the
taste
was
also
laden
with
the
banana
flavor
but
mixed
with
sweet
malt
and
other
fruits
flavors
as
well
as
spices
like
clove
and
perhaps
nutmeg
i
found
the
alcohol
to
be
hidden
well
although
i
guess
some
would
disagree
the
mouthfeel
was
creamy
and
thick
carbonation
was
much
less
biting
than
i
expected
considering
the
huge
head
it
produced
when
poured
drinkability
was
also
great
i
wouldnt
expect
it
to
be
with
a
high
abv
like
this
but
i
cant
help
myself
the
taste
is
so
good
that
i
must
have
another
to
me
beer
just
doesnt
get
much
better
than
this
i
will
definatly
buy
this
again
11
2
oz
bottle
sampled
on
123003
out
of
a
st
bernardus
goblet
that
came
with
the
four
bottle
sampler
pack
purchased
that
day
in
blacksburg
virginiavintage
cellar
had
4
or
5
left
then
in
addition
to
the
smiling
monk
on
the
label
is
a
best
before
date
in
flemish
french
and
a
couple
other
languages
that
tell
you
to
drink
it
before
the
end
of
2005
okay
ill
bite
didnt
know
at
the
time
of
sampling
if
i
would
last
into
2004
the
belgian
ale
pours
into
the
goblet
a
deep
dark
brown
almost
opaque
the
head
is
enormous
beige
and
frothy
with
an
abudance
of
tiny
bubbles
lacing
slowly
climbs
down
the
glass
the
aroma
is
of
a
classic
brown
belgian
strong
ale
bigtime
bananas
in
the
nose
followed
by
the
spice
cabinet
of
coriander
and
allspice
medium
bodied
in
the
mouth
tart
and
a
lot
of
carbonation
taste
begins
tart
and
spicy
the
alcohol
is
not
well
disguised
plenty
of
earthy
belgian
yeast
notes
are
also
on
the
palate
the
tart
fruitsgrapes
and
plums
on
steroids
ride
a
solid
malt
backbone
to
a
smooth
yet
powerful
finish
very
good
ale
and
worthy
of
its
lofty
rating
personally
i
prefer
the
st
bernardus
pater
6
the
alcohol
in
the
12
is
just
a
bit
too
overpowering
my
100th
beer
karma
point
hmmm
what
should
i
say
about
this
that
hasnt
already
been
said
not
much
really
i
will
say
i
was
a
little
surprised
in
that
this
bottle
didnt
seem
as
ripe
as
it
could
have
been
i
regret
not
lettng
it
age
some
before
trying
it
raisins
hops
cloves
banana
aroma
and
notes
nice
balance
overall
i
cant
wait
to
try
westy
12
after
this
an
incredibly
satisfying
beer
the
flavors
all
meld
so
well
no
one
flavor
washes
out
any
other
almost
indescribable
in
its
drinkability
a
masterpiece
of
a
beer
and
the
only
one
to
date
that
ive
given
straight
5s
i
must
say
that
i
was
blown
away
after
drinking
this
beer
it
was
truly
a
privilege
to
have
had
it
it
poured
a
dark
brown
color
with
a
small
to
medium
controlled
tan
head
with
lots
of
carbonation
and
bubbles
running
to
the
top
the
smell
is
really
yeasty
and
bready
sweet
the
taste
is
amazing
it
starts
out
lighter
in
body
and
taste
and
then
expands
to
a
deep
thickness
i
cant
believe
its
10
abv
because
the
body
and
taste
would
tell
me
otherwise
the
initial
flavor
reminds
me
of
raisinettes
dry
fruit
flavor
resinates
a
bready
flavor
ensues
mixed
with
some
yeast
its
not
the
base
but
its
very
solid
in
the
body
the
yeast
strain
is
amazing
and
really
sets
this
beer
apart
each
taste
brought
me
new
flavors
and
new
insights
into
this
beer
i
must
get
it
again
yummy
ill
have
to
get
this
again
this
has
indeed
earned
its
place
in
the
top
50
and
indeed
a
place
in
my
favorite
beer
list
in
my
opinion
this
is
better
and
a
lot
more
drinkable
than
the
westy
12
i
am
very
happy
with
my
choice
absolute
joy
to
drink
one
of
my
highest
rated
beers
thus
far
edit
1219
had
this
a
couple
times
since
this
review
and
have
to
say
that
im
not
as
impressed
i
was
a
little
drunk
when
i
had
it
last
first
time
too
at
monks
so
maybe
its
too
be
expected
i
inflated
the
score
so
i
knocked
the
taste
down
to
4
5
rich
full
round
velvety
smooth
mouthfeel
that
seemed
lighter
due
to
great
balance
and
carbonation
wicked
drinkable
for
a
10
beer
outstanding
i
have
been
anticipating
trying
this
one
since
my
beerloving
friends
rave
about
it
they
were
right
this
is
one
of
the
good
ones
pouring
a
cloudy
amber
to
hazy
brown
brew
with
a
lot
of
offwhite
head
the
lacing
is
pronounced
and
long
lived
the
surprise
was
that
it
blew
the
cork
out
of
the
bottle
when
i
removed
the
twistwire
the
first
beer
that
i
have
seen
do
this
it
is
a
peppy
beer
with
lots
of
malt
hops
and
grain
in
the
aroma
there
are
hints
of
clove
and
malt
in
the
taste
which
is
outstanding
this
looks
tastes
feels
like
a
true
abbey
it
is
creamy
and
rich
in
the
mouth
and
i
could
drink
this
for
a
long
time
the
high
alcohol
level
isnt
noticeable
until
the
bottle
is
gone
the
extremely
happy
smiling
monk
on
the
slightly
crookedly
placed
label
should
serve
as
sign
of
things
to
come
this
was
a
full
flavored
ale
as
malt
caramel
and
fruit
flavors
were
strong
smooth
creaminess
on
the
tongue
when
you
first
sip
it
then
the
carbonation
level
caused
a
crisp
finish
medium
bodied
and
alcohol
levels
were
well
hidden
making
this
extremely
drinkable
one
of
the
top
belgian
ales
i
have
tried
my
favorites
are
still
rochefort
8
and
10
though
i
had
been
a
bit
turned
off
to
this
style
after
sampling
a
bottle
of
trappistes
rochefort
10
but
found
the
st
bernardus
12
to
be
a
much
more
refreshing
and
enjoyable
example
of
it
and
cant
wait
to
try
a
few
more
this
one
poured
with
a
slightly
frothy
offwhite
head
and
had
a
cloudy
ruby
colour
to
it
the
smell
was
quite
good
but
not
overly
complex
with
malt
hop
butter
and
caramel
being
the
most
prominent
that
i
can
recall
the
taste
was
equally
good
with
a
tart
caramel
buttery
feel
to
it
along
with
a
sour
fruity
cherry
taste
this
one
has
enhanced
fruit
flavouring
as
well
as
it
warms
theres
a
nice
little
carbonation
bite
at
the
finish
of
an
otherwise
smooth
drink
a
solid
brew
i
typically
keep
my
beers
in
the
fridge
and
let
them
sit
out
for
510
minutes
before
opening
the
bottle
evidently
i
was
a
little
over
eager
and
opened
this
one
while
it
was
still
a
bit
too
cold
i
was
quite
surprised
by
the
changes
for
the
better
in
flavor
as
abt
12
warmed
overall
an
incredible
beer
that
is
one
notch
below
the
rochefort
10
but
i
will
still
drink
hundreds
of
bottles
of
this
beer
when
i
am
in
belgium
this
summer
overall
impression
thinking
this
would
go
very
well
with
a
roast
or
a
beef
meal
its
flavor
is
pronounced
but
not
overwhelming
the
spices
are
reminiscent
of
unibroues
blend
drinkability
is
impaired
only
by
the
alcoholic
kick
that
has
clouded
my
wits
after
the
first
goblet
this
is
truly
worthy
of
the
top
50
spot
it
holds
a
classic
brew
one
to
go
to
school
on
update
24
hours
later
i
ate
the
thumbsized
foamscicle
that
had
formed
at
the
top
of
the
bottle
it
was
amazing
i
am
therefore
upgrading
the
drinkability
score
from
4
5
to
5
0
no
beer
in
my
experience
has
produced
such
pleasure
with
so
little
weight
for
so
long
after
it
was
opened
bravo
the
poor
mans
westy
pours
a
deep
garnet
color
with
a
gorgeous
white
head
very
warming
beer
the
alcohol
is
apparent
but
enjoyable
mostly
raisins
in
the
taste
a
little
plum
very
fruity
supposedly
the
same
recipe
as
westy
12
but
if
i
had
a
choice
i
would
go
with
the
westy
but
then
again
i
am
a
poor
man
poured
a
dark
brownish
color
an
aroma
that
was
very
complex
abbey
type
malts
and
the
smell
of
well
kept
but
old
monastery
wine
casks
thick
chewy
mouthfeel
and
the
taste
so
many
things
going
on
here
fig
cherry
chocolate
banana
all
perfectly
blended
and
the
alcohol
does
sneak
up
on
you
plan
on
storing
a
couple
to
see
if
this
wonderful
gets
even
better
a
very
fine
belgian
top
notch
and
deserving
of
its
reputation
as
one
of
the
best
beers
in
the
world
this
is
one
of
my
oh
my
beers
the
beers
that
i
cant
help
saying
oh
my
after
ive
taken
a
sip
very
dark
red
almost
black
with
a
healthy
tan
head
sweet
with
brown
sugar
raisins
cherries
clove
and
a
bit
of
bready
malt
improves
as
it
goes
and
it
starts
very
well
clean
and
well
balanced
with
a
spicy
hop
and
alcohol
finish
very
nice
well
made
beer
definitly
will
be
getting
a
second
look
to
date
the
best
beer
ive
tasted
pours
a
mammothiceburg
of
a
headperfect
lace
which
covers
at
least
75
of
the
glass
and
takes
a
good
five
minutes
to
retreat
the
color
is
that
of
dark
cocoa
with
some
ruby
hues
gobs
of
cocoa
on
the
nose
wonderful
sweet
raisin
and
prune
aromas
bathed
in
brown
sugar
and
butter
damn
inticing
sweet
on
the
nose
yet
with
a
snappy
acidity
to
keep
focus
a
dream
of
a
brew
to
taste
full
bodied
rich
and
malty
with
waves
of
tangy
bitter
chocolate
cocoa
powder
sauteed
prune
in
brown
butter
exotic
spiceineffablevanilla
cinnamon
mollaseshard
to
put
down
add
the
perfect
balance
and
the
fact
that
the
alcohol
is
so
well
integrated
and
i
think
ive
found
a
perfect
brew
cant
ask
for
any
more
not
a
complainti
could
sip
this
into
eternity
the
mouthfeel
is
silk
just
drink
this
one
i
will
get
more
this
is
a
celebratory
beer
i
understand
now
what
it
would
be
like
to
have
walked
all
day
to
a
monastery
and
have
slaked
my
thirst
on
a
safe
liquid
that
came
from
god
very
dark
with
a
light
tan
head
smell
is
not
too
impressive
and
kind
of
fruity
this
one
is
all
about
taste
to
me
theres
a
creaminess
that
is
appealing
to
say
the
least
the
alcohol
tingles
on
the
tongue
and
warms
your
insides
on
the
way
down
despite
this
the
beer
does
not
have
an
overpowering
alcohol
taste
it
is
nicely
balanced
and
one
id
like
to
have
on
hand
more
often
if
i
could
afford
it
first
sip
sweet
kiss
of
malt
and
happy
yeast
free
range
evidently
as
it
warms
more
orchard
flavors
sweet
bready
yeast
and
here
comes
that
damn
fruit
fly
again
filling
combination
of
flavors
and
sensations
make
me
completely
forget
that
i
was
going
to
have
dinner
after
this
wonderful
once
again
let
it
be
noted
that
a
label
featuring
a
smiling
monk
holding
a
beer
designates
a
truly
fantastic
brew
solid
solid
belgian
pours
ruby
to
brown
in
tglass
chalice
forms
a
nice
3
finger
head
that
sticks
around
to
the
bottom
slightly
sweet
though
not
overlyso
for
its
type
yeasty
but
not
overpowering
in
that
regard
velvetysmooth
in
the
mouth
with
plum
slight
tang
of
citrus
peaking
around
the
end
truly
a
great
beer
although
not
the
best
in
its
style
it
is
competing
with
the
cremedelacreme
of
the
beer
world
and
it
definately
holds
its
own
drinkability
a
delicious
fireside
sipper
this
ale
certainly
deserves
all
of
the
accolades
heaped
upon
it
one
of
my
new
favorites
the
aroma
is
of
overripe
plums
a
bit
of
alcohol
and
a
really
deep
red
wine
the
color
is
dark
ruby
brown
only
a
small
amount
of
light
escapes
this
brew
wow
this
is
incredibly
smooth
the
alcohol
smell
and
the
10
abv
had
me
expecting
the
worse
but
theres
nothing
to
be
afraid
of
the
taste
is
of
dark
ripe
fruits
balanced
by
a
very
light
nuttiness
and
a
bit
of
hops
to
even
it
all
out
this
stuff
even
makes
your
burps
taste
good
i
could
drink
this
abt
12
daily
time
to
take
out
an
extra
student
loan
poured
into
a
beautiful
sort
of
bowl
shaped
st
bernadus
glass
half
the
beer
in
my
glass
was
thick
white
foam
but
this
led
to
a
very
smoothalmost
thick
and
extremely
creamy
mouthfeel
the
first
sip
of
this
brownish
colored
abbey
style
ale
is
bits
of
caramel
and
fruit
theres
some
green
apple
in
the
aroma
which
in
any
other
beer
could
be
considered
a
flaw
almost
smoky
caramel
flavors
with
bits
of
dark
fruit
such
as
figs
or
plums
periously
drinkable
for
its
strength
a
bit
more
rustic
for
me
than
the
last
time
i
had
this
on
tap
at
the
map
room
in
chicago
an
aroma
of
plum
clove
fruitiness
and
some
sweetness
emanates
from
the
glass
pours
with
a
light
brown
head
and
it
is
a
cloudy
amberbrown
color
a
very
thick
lasting
rocky
head
tops
this
beer
it
is
very
well
carbonated
very
spicy
tasting
accompanied
by
a
certain
mustiness
finishes
with
a
bit
of
sweetness
the
dense
rocky
head
and
the
belgian
lacing
on
this
beer
is
quite
amazing
alcohol
in
the
finish
along
with
a
certain
astringency
malty
fruity
caramel
notes
and
a
strong
finish
of
rich
fruit
perhaps
plum
andor
cherry
quite
a
complex
brew
very
light
in
body
but
quite
a
mouthful
that
will
hit
you
when
you
stand
up
as
it
warms
up
it
gets
a
bit
more
sweet
more
fruity
and
it
loses
a
bit
of
the
astringency
in
the
finish
a
great
example
and
a
must
try
for
anyone
i
read
all
the
hype
so
i
figured
what
the
hell
it
pours
a
nice
hazy
brown
with
a
goodsized
head
the
smell
is
sweet
sweet
malt
clove
and
yeast
the
taste
is
sweet
and
malty
think
brown
sugar
spices
maybe
a
little
banana
finishes
with
a
decent
alcohol
smack
nice
creamy
body
extremely
smooth
in
the
mouth
this
beer
is
great
for
the
style
i
guess
im
not
really
too
hyped
on
the
style
though
so
as
far
as
personal
tastes
go
its
good
not
great
and
maybe
on
rare
occasions
id
hit
it
up
good
very
well
crafted
beer
perfect
for
an
after
dinner
drink
in
place
of
a
port
wine
if
i
may
quote
uncle
jesse
from
full
house
but
leads
to
some
mild
flavors
of
plum
and
caramel
finishes
spicy
and
alcoholic
this
is
a
quality
strong
belgian
ale
complex
taste
a
warming
spiced
up
alcoholic
flavor
with
trickles
of
leaves
a
thick
dark
roasted
malt
aftertaste
on
my
tongue
this
beer
is
complex
creamy
flavor
hard
to
describe
must
be
experienced
i
guess
and
lace
smells
of
ripe
fruit
a
strong
overall
aroma
heavy
carbonation
in
the
mouthfeel
of
this
one
this
beer
is
dark
brown
with
a
very
thin
deep
brown
yet
with
light
behind
it
with
two
huge
fingers
of
light
tan
foam
there
is
lots
and
lots
of
lace
left
behind
with
each
sip
the
smell
is
fruity
and
pleasant
raisins
and
the
presence
of
banana
on
the
palate
extremely
well
balances
finish
is
silky
smooth
and
absolutely
scrumptious
another
belgian
masterpiece
that
i
will
drink
again
and
again
and
again

the

the

of
this

marvelously
looks
and
tastes
like
the
beer
has
not
changed
or
lost
a

of
its
originality
since
it
was
first
brewed
truly
one
of
the
most
complex
strong
belgians
out
there
st

is
one
hell
of
a
brewery
ill
have
to
be
a
real
bastard
here
and
disagree
with
everyone
i
just
thought
it
was
too
strong
for
its
own
good
the
alcohol
showed
way
to
much
quite
simplitic
for
such
a
malty
strong
brew
im
glad
i
tried
it
and
im
sorry
for
the
low
rating
but
thats
just
how
i
felt
about
it
it
was
a

sickly

seems

according
to

owner

its

full

incredible

which
took

by

mellow

has
pretty

everything
you
are
looking
for
in
a
beer
overall
delicious
smooth
quad
would
love
to
drink
this
again
cloudy
brown
with
thin

nice
spice
aromas
this
is
definitely
a
slow
drinking
beer
not
one
to
consume
in
multiples
the
10
abv
is
there
but
somewhat
masked
with
a
nice
taste
decent
mouthfeel
this
is
one
i
would
go
back
to
but
not
buy
in
large
quantities
unless
you
were
serving
to
people
that
could
appreciate
this
style
overall
mmmm
really
really
good
perhaps
my
favorite
quad
yet
in
part
to
the
fact
that
it
doesnt
make
me
feel
like
im
gonna
develop
diabetes
from
drinking
it
as
most
are
too
sugary
and
syrupy
for
my
liking
this
one
is
up
my
alley
though
nice
smooth
delivery
of
a
complex
yet
refined
dark
fruity
and
bready
profile
i
got
banana
bread
like
overtones
on
this
one
i
feel
like
it
offers
a
bit
more
than
the
abt
12
but
without
the
big
bite
of
the
12
drank
for
the
first
time
this
past
christmas
season
and
i
now
babe
a
new
favorite
christmas
beer
perfectly
balanced
and
with
a
high
abv
i
would
have
never
guessed
it
to
be
so
smooth
the
abby
ales
are
rising
to
the
top
of
my
favorites
list
overall
a
great
beer
and
one
ill
definitely
buy
again
a
good
way
to
usher
in
the
new
year
would
highly
recommend
a
pretty
fun
take
on
the
base
beer
with
christmas
fruit
cake
spices
throughout
along
with
the
dark
sweet
fruits
is
a
general
tone
of
caramelized
banana
a
decent
mouthfeel
with
good
carbonation
to
move
the
beer
around
overall
a
very
good
beer
but
i
definitely
prefer
abt
12
i
generally
avoid
winter
warmers
and
holidayspiced
beers
but
this
one
is
very
well
done
the
spices
are
not
overwhelming
or
unbalancing
but
to
me
they
still
detract
from
the
sweet
rich
flavor
characteristic
of
the
style
i
doubt
i
will
try
this
again
but
its
not
because
i
didnt
like
it
anyone
who
enjoys
holiday
beers
should
check
this
one
out
and
definitely
try
de
dolle
stille
nacht
while
youre
at
it
osetting
aside
my
quibbles
with
the
mouthfeel
this
is
a
great
holiday
offering
it
doesnt
rank
as
high
as
the
abt
12
because
even
i
found
it
a
bit
too
sweet
and
spicy
but
if
you
want
a
big
dark
holiday
offering
there
are
not
many
choices
better
than
this
picked
up
a
bomber
for
a
christmas
celebration
poured
a
dark
ruby
red
with
a
small
white
fluffy
head
i
picked
up
what
i
thought
to
be
malts
in
the
nose
along
with
spices
dark
fruits
and
floral
notes
taste
was
off
for
me
at
first
i
did
not
detect
the
spices
in
the
taste
as
i
did
in
the
nose
i
definitely
tasted
what
i
thought
to
be
fruits
and
some
sort
of
for
lack
of
a
better
work
floral
tastes
i
am
glad
i
was
sharing
a
bomber
because
i
would
not
have
been
able
to
drink
this
by
myself
the
alcohol
was
well
hidden
i
am
new
to
quads
but
i
would
purchase
again
this
is
a
good
seasonal
beer
however
i
thought
it
was
a
little
too
sweet
and
carbonated
for
my
liking
i
think
next
time
i
could
split
it
with
somebody
because
it
is
too
rich
to
drink
the
whole
bomber
by
myself
great
seasonal
very
smooth
well
hidden
alcohol
overall
what
a
treat
great
christmas
beer
but
i
can
obviously
see
this
bee
delicious
at
any
time
especially
in
winter
similar
to
abt12
there
are
resemblances
but
this
is
its
own
beer
through
in
through
with
the
butterscotch
being
the
star
overall
very
nice
christmas
beer
with
two
bottles
of
this
tonight
at
10
abv
it
most
certainly
is
the
most
wonderful
time
of
the
year
overall
this
beer
tastes
like
it
comes
from
an
older
time
and
i
can
respect
that
i
wouldnt
drink
it
all
the
time
but
it
was
a
nice
experience
and
change
of
pace
went
great
with
brie
and
st
josephs
abbey
spencer
damson
plum
jam
champagne
like
carb
refreshing
great
a
really
nice
winter
quad
that
i
would
really
look
forward
to
making
a
christmas
tradition
this
brewery
continues
to
do
great
beers
deep
brown
mahogany
with
ruby
highlights
in
the
correct
light
strong
carbonation
maintains
a
thin
head
and
accentuates
a
nice
feel
the
flavor
is
breadier
than
i
expected
almost
marzen
like
but
obviously
with
greater
potency
slightly
spicy
character
but
more
related
to
the
yeast
than
actual
spice
additions
quite
dry
finish
with
barely
a
hint
of
alcohol
lovely
beer
overall
delicious
with
a
perfect
blend
of
fruit
malts
and
spiciness
this
tastes
how
a
christmas
ale
should
in
my
opinion
consumed
on
christmas
day
2014
o
i
always
heard
good
things
and
i
was
certainly
not
disappointed
definitely
a
goto
christmas
from
now
on
overall
this
is
a
great
christmas
ale
it
is
not
as
rich
and
spiced
as
many
christmas
ales
and
you
need
to
be
in
the
mood
for
an
extremely
sweet
belgian
ale
but
if
you
are
then
this
is
an
amazing
beer
o
really
really
like
this
beer
perhaps
more
than
abt
12
maybe
my
favorite
quad
its
become
a
christmas
tradition
more
classic
in
taste
in
style
clear
malt
strong
yeast
qualities
darker
fruits
clear
shot
of
alcohol
in
the
gut
richness
nicely
drying
on
the
finish

fruity
with
a
slight

deep

color
with

head
and
some
spotty
lacing
aromas
of
sweet
bread
alcohol
soaked
dark
fruit
fruit
cake
spice
burnt
caramel
and
toffee
i
could
keep
going
with
descriptors
because
its
a
deeply
enticing
brew
taste
is
of
alcohol
soaked
dark
fruit
sweet
bread
cherry
spice
pear
burnt
caramel
and
toffee
great
creamy
mouthfeel
finishes
dry
light
medium
body
and
scary
drinkability
for
a
beer
with
10
alcohol
this
is
a
great
christmas
beer
with
a
seemingly
endless
flavor
profile
great
dark
fruits
little
tart
on
the
back
just
a
wonderful
beer
a
brilliant
holiday
ale
my
favorite
in
fact
rich
and
complex
with
tones
of
delightful
spice
surprisingly
easy
to
drink
quickly
though
i
wouldnt
recommend
rushing
this
one
on
tap
at
mcnellies
okc
pours
a
reddish
brown
with
a
fantastically
creamy
head
that
hangs
around
for
a
long
time
thick
substantial
lacing
on
the
glass
its
a
bit
cold
and
i
imagine
the
temperature
is
keeping
the
aroma
subdued
theres
some
breadiness
and
a
bit
of
spice
lots
of
dark
fruit
and
spices
on
the
tongue
much
like
a
fruitcake
sweet
toffee
on
the
end
but
not
a
huge
aftertaste
its
very
creamy
but
not
overly
thick
this
is
one
of
the
better
christmas
beers
that
ive
tried
and
ill
certainly
choose
this
one
again
overall
this
is
an
excellent
beer
i
thoroughly
enjoyed
it
the
higher
alcohol
content
would
prevent
me
from
having
it
often
but
its
great
to
have
on
a
special
occasion
like
christmas
this
beer
would
most
certainly
appeal
to
anyone
who
enjoys
the
belgian
quad
style
o
dangerous
beer
here
perhaps
the
lightest
easiest
drinking
quad
ive
run
across
so
far
in
limited
experience
with
the
style
its
got
plenty
of
darkfruit
notes
even
as
dark
as
raisins
but
its
still
very
accessible
and
sweet
a
definite
must
have
during
the
holiday
season
pours
dark
reddishbrown
with
a
nice
one
finger
of
light
foam
that
receded
pretty
quickly
very
light
lacing
the
aroma
is
heavy
of
dark
fruits
and
sweet
malt
with
a
very
light
nutmeg
or
allspice
note
the
taste
is
very
nice
with
sweet
malt
figs
plums
raisins
nutmeg
and
a
touch
of
vanilla
blending
superbly
not
one
overpowers
any
of
the
others
the
mouthfeel
is
mediumbodied
very
smooth
with
just
a
touch
of
alcohol
burn
i
think
this
one
would
really
benefit
from
a
bit
of
aging
overall
this
is
a
very
tasty
beer
fits
perfectly
for
the
season
i
cant
remember
exactly
what
this
tasted
like
thats
the
problem
w
having
a
christmas
beer
party
theres
so
many
good
ones
but
they
all
blur
i
think
i
slightly
prefer
scaldis
noel
i
like
it
not
too
sweet
and
a
nice
spice
finish
cheers
this
is
excellent
stuff
as
i
would
expect
from
this
brewery
why
have
i
never
tasted
it
before
i
have
three
more
bottles
to
cellar
and
i
expect
them
to
improve
hopefully
after
a
year
or
so
the
spices
will
integrate
a
bit
and
as
they
fade
after
more
years
i
hope
to
see
some
development
of
the
dark
fruit
leather
tobacco
favors
that
can
show
up
in
the
great
quads
as
they
age
maybe
the
spices
will
be
able
to
last
till
then
too
time
will
tell
everything
you
love
about
the
abt12
with
a
little
more
spice
dare
to
say
my
2
beer
this
was
good
very
nutmegy
and
peppery
very
warming
with
the
alcohol
and
cinnamon
mild
hops
fairly
high
carbonation
medium
body
i
deeply
enjoy
the
abt12
however
i
just
purchased
a
few
11
2
oz
bottles
of
this
christmas
ale
for
me
this
is
nearly
the
best
ale
i
have
tried
i
prefer
a
sweeter
ale
with
less
hops
and
this
is
it
o
i
am
rather
underwhelmed
by
this
beer
especially
from
st
bernardus
the
abt
12
is
spectacular
but
this
does
not
disguise
the
alcohol
content
half
as
well
instead
it
disguises
the
underlying
yeast
flavors
with
alcohol
and
spice
i
wouldnt
say
it
is
a
bad
beer
but
i
would
not
go
out
of
my
way
to
have
it
again
perhaps
if
i
were
to
encounter
it
on
tap
somewhere
for
a
decent
price
per
pour
outstanding
corked
and
caged
750
ml
bottle
shared
with
dad
pours
dark
reddish
brown
some
purple
color
creamy
one
finger
white
to
off
white
head
aroma
has
much
more
fruit
character
than
the
12
with
lots
of
sweet
cherry
notes
caramel
malts
funky
belgian
yeast
of
course
and
candi
sugar
much
more
muted
hop
notes
here
than
the
12
as
well
flavor
follows
the
smell
closely
with
big
sweet
fruit
flavorstastes
like
the
added
cherries
to
this
one
but
cant
find
info
on
fruit
additionslight
spice
candi
sugar
and
sweet
malts
very
smooth
and
pleasant
sweet
but
not
cloying
medium
carbonation
and
plus
body
this
was
really
nice
purchased
in
italy
very
dark
with
lots
of
bubbles
cant
even
tell
that
its
10
top
5
christmas
beers
year
in
and
year
out
not
too
bad
tastes
like
an
apple
wheat
beer
with
spice
at
10
abv
it
is
easy
to
drink
and
alcohol
is
well
hidden
full
great
flavor
nice
head
overall
you
have
to
be
in
the
mood
for
a
beer
like
this
perhaps
october
is
a
little
early
for
a
christmas
tasting
brew
regardless
as
far
as
xmas
beers
though
this
one
is
solid
its
got
a
fruit
cake
like
flavour
and
the
abv
is
very
well
hidden
decent
beer
i
would
not
go
out
of
my
way
to
buy
it
though
o
very
nice
high
carb
actually
makes
this
super
drinkable
for
what
it
is
and
the
peppery
spice
with
a
year
of
age
on
it
melds
beautifully
with
the
beer
very
sweet
smell
kind
of
like
bubble
gum
nice
shiny
brown
pour
awesome
taste
sweet
malty
caramel
and
bananas
very
fine
beer
o
excellent
brew
got
online
in
thailand
drank
for
the
second
time
january
5th
2015
drank
first
at
turkey
creek
nc
two
summers
ago
i
went
to
the
brewery
near
watou
last
christmas
and
they
had
none
left
i
asked
the
head
brewer
to
be
sure
to
send
more
brews
particularly
this
one
to
china
was
glad
to
have
at
least
found
it
in
thailand
o
more
like
an
abt
12
than
st
bernardus
prior
8
better
than
the
prior
8
and
if
not
for
the
aroma
it
would
be
better
than
the
abt
12
too
despite
the
xmas
theme
quite
enjoyable
in
the
summer
highly
recommended
oi
like
this
beer
on
a
chilly
evening
when
i
only
want
one
beer
ost
bernardus
does
no
wrong
this
christmas
ale
ages
perfectly
you
can
sip
one
in
the
summer
this
quad
was
meant
to
be
sipped
so
complex
and
boozy
i
do
wish
the
body
was
more
grand
and
creamy
silky
other
than
that
you
cant
get
much
better
in
look
smell
and
taste
quads
are
probably
the
best
beer
style
on
earth
st
bernardus
christmas
ale
is
powerful
proof
for
that
claim
quite
a
dangerous
beer
very
tasty
and
balanced
one
might
finish
the
0
75
l
bottle
without
even
noticing
christmas
ale
indeed
overall
a
great
winter
brew
well
balanced
crisp
and
enjoyable
after
every
sip
the
belgians
know
how
to
brew
if
you
can
get
your
hands
on
this
i
recommend
it
750ml
bottle
this
one
pours
a
very
cloudy
mahogany
brown
color
there
was
almost
no
head
on
it
and
left
no
lacing
nice
nose
christmas
spices
caramel
malt
faint
dark
fruits
some
breadiness
and
belgian
yeast
notes
the
taste
is
very
good
rich
malts
not
too
much
sweetness
dark
fruits
yeasty
and
bready
christmas
spices
definitely
a
keeper
has
this
on
tap
at
monks
also
and
was
equally
good
as
the
bottled
version
beer
is
mediumlight
in
body
with
carbonation
of
high
intensity
resulting
in
a
somewhat
fizzy
calming
to
foamy
and
smooth
mouthfeel
the
mouthfeel
fits
the
expected
idea
for
a
belgian
trappist
though
i
think
its
a
bit
overly
aggressive
and
rough
for
such
a
huge
beer
ethanol
present
as
slight
heat
in
nostrils
and
mild
burn
on
the
back
of
the
throat
closes
dry
with
moderate
stickiness
lingering
on
the
palate
ooverall
a
great
christmas
ale
my
new
favorite
overall
dangerously
sessionable
for
a
10
abv
very
enjoyable
id
love
to
age
a
couple
of
these
in
the
basement
i
knew
this
would
be
the
clear
winner
of
the
tasting
as
soon
as
i
took
a
sip
of
it
it
may
not
have
the
yeasty
prowess
of
other
quads
we
tasted
nor
as
much
of
a
robust
malt
profile
but
it
certainly
wins
in
its
ever
unique
profile
and
versatility
for
the
pure
and
simple
purpose
of
consumption
id
love
to
buy
a
case
of
this
and
see
how
it
evolves
over
the
course
of
12
years
but
every
vintage
is
different
it
seems
the
2012
from
what
i
can
gather
is
going
to
be
quite
generous
in
its
development
the
13
is
drinking
supremely
well
as
well
and
whether
fresh
or
aged
this
beer
really
knocks
most
spiced
beers
out
of
the
park
and
perhaps
most
of
its
other
belgian
peers
overall
o
i
dont
usually
like
belgian
quads
or
tripels
as
their
often
cloying
this
was
quite
excellent
though
would
pair
great
with
christmas
dinner
could
go
well
as
a
dessert
on
its
on
with
dessert
or
in
contrast
to
a
savory
dish
too
much
flavor
for
white
meat
or
blander
food
one
of
my
favorite
belgians
a
murky
mahogany
color
with
an
island
of
wispy
offwhite
fizz
on
top
and
decent
traces
of
lace
the
aroma
offers
delicate
malt
and
hints
of
apple
and
maybe
even
a
touch
of
clove
weaker
than
i
expected
but
it
comes
through
if
you
give
it
a
chance
the
flavor
commands
an
unusual
fruit
melange
that
includes
cotton
candy
mango
and
grapefruit
quite
odd
at
once
interestingly
nice
but
then
a
bit
offputting
caramel
malt
is
definitely
there
but
the
odd
fermenting
fruit
flavors
take
over
and
its
attention
getting
theres
some
cinnamon
and
grassy
grain
apple
to
top
off
this
interesting
brew
alcohol
is
not
overly
notable
but
its
a
little
warming
the
body
is
easily
medium
with
a
good
fizzy
carbonation
that
gives
it
a
slightly
lighter
feel
for
the
style
worth
a
try
but
not
a
real
wow
for
me
overall
4
0
just
an
outstanding
seasonal
brew

smooth
and
dangerously
sessionable

abv
this
is
a
present
i
want
under
my
tree
every
year
i
know
that
some
purists
out
there
may
complain
about
specialty
market
this
and
that
but
if
every
specialty
beer
could
turn
out
like
this
one
wow
all
i
have
to
say
is
vive
le
marché
spécial
also
why
is
this
not
classified
as
a
belgian
strong
dark
seriously
get
it
right
folks
o
probably
the
second
best
beer
they
make
its
a
great
beer
to
have
on
christmas
o
excellent
as
always
from
st
b
ill
always
drink
one
of
these
during
the
holidays
i
hope
o
remarkably
drinkable
at
10
nicely
balanced
and
quite
a
mellow
beer
in
all
respects
would
have
liked
a
bit
more
dark
dried
fruit
and
spice
since
its
a
christmas
ale
quite
pricey
too
poured
ontap
and
served
in
a
chalice
the
beer
is
a
dark
ruby
coloring
that
is
hazy
with
a
clingy
coating
offwhite
head
nose
of
date
cherry
fig
roasted
notes
booze
and
sour
tannins
flavors
are
tart
and
crisp
forward
with
cherry
tones
forming
a
foundation
beneath
oldworld
fruit
richness
of
date
and
fig
very
layered
very
rich
and
very
balanced
rich
cherry
and
fig
aftertaste
with
earthy
and
woody
notes
the
finish
is
lingering
sweet
with
a
perfect
balance
great
beer
o
love
it
cheers
o
a
belgian
winter
warmer
if
ive
ever
had
one
very
spicy
almost
a
little
too
onenote
since
the
spices
are
so
prominent
quite
tasty
though
i
will
give
it
that
really
good
ale
deep
head
with
a
fruitynutty
aroma
nice
moderate
body
with
appropriate
carbonation
dark
fruitynutty
taste
finish
is
nice
and
lingers
and
then
gets
hit
with
an
alcohol
taste
this
beer
was
definitely
enjoyable
during
the
holidays
and
was
an
appropriate
recipe
as
a
seasonal
probably
a
top
christmas
beer
that
ive
tried
o
good
i
just
wish
it
had
a
fuller
body
pours
deep
dark
brown
with
immense
thick
white
foam
heavy
lacing
patchy
all
over
rich
toasty
fruity
nose
raisins
and
cinnamon
nutmeg
plummy
hearty
flavor
spiced
malt
quite
boozy
cherries
chocolate
loads
going
on
here
powerful
carbonation
excellent
overall
an
excellent
beer
pretty
much
how
i
expect
belgian
christmas
beers
to
be
recommended
o
a
terrific
seasonal
just
a
shade
under
the
abt
12
recommended
great
to
give
as
a
gift
overall
i
think
this
is
an
excellent
beer
and
if
memory
serves
it
is
somewhat
of
a
bargain
in
terms
of
price
obviously
a
year
in
waiting
did
not
hurt
it
any
i
would
not
hesitate
to
pick
up
leftover
bottles
and
let
them
stay
with
me
until
next
christmas
good
stuff
christmas
ale
is
definitely
a
bit
fruitier
and
less
chocolately
mouthfeel
was
a
bit
thinner
than
expected
but
still
not
bad
i
like
the
12
slightly
better
but
you
really
cant
go
wrong
with
any
of
the
bernardus
beers
around
the
holiday
season
a
very
good
beer
with
a
great
depth
of
flavor
o
a
delicious
quad
this
beer
evolves
as
it
warms
bringing
out
more
flavor
and
complexity
perfect
to
wind
down
with
on
a
cold
winter
day
banana
in
the
nose
obscures
some
of
the
more
subtle
flavor
elements
but
they
are
there
if
you
like
st
bs
dark
you
will
like
this
for
the
same
reasons
nice
one
to
wrap
up
the
holiday
this
is
a
great
quad
the
craftsmanship
is
very
impressive
this
is
pretty
similar
to
their
abt
12
in
my
opinion
theres
minor
differences
especially
the
subtle
spices
i
think
id
give
abt
12
the
edge
but
id
have
to
do
a
side
by
side
to
really
tell
either
way
this
is
a
great
beer
recommended
o
this
was
awesome
merry
christmas
another
great
beer
from
st
bernardus
a
bit
expensive
though
cheers
come
mid
summer
on
a
cool
evening
this
should
be
a
genuine
treat
o
has
the
typical
goodness
of
an
authentic
dark
belgian
beer
with
just
enough
spices
to
make
it
festive
i
would
recommend
this
beer
during
the
holiday
and
winter
season
mmm
mmm
o
4
good
belgian
beer
nice
and
fruity
id
have
it
again
so
like
said
exs
sister
that
i
never
got
a
piece
of
st
berny
christmas
was
a
bit
less
flavorful
slightly
less
robust
but
im
sure
like
a
romp
with
sister
2
it
was
still
a
good
time
poured
into
a
westmalle
goblet
looks
like
a
wonderfully
made
milk
chocolate
with
whip
cream
on
top
thick
white
head
followed
by
a
cloudy
chocolate
alcohol
warms
it
enough
so
that
it
smells
and
tastes
like
hot
chocolate
it
almost
melts
the
sugars
and
hops
are
perfectly
balanced
at
10
drinkability
is
fantastic
12oz
snifter
victoria
gastro
pub
columbia
md
yeah
its
great
made
the
mistake
of
starting
this
too
cold
opened
up
after
warming
as
a
huge
fan
of
the
abt12
i
was
excited
to
see
this
on
tap
at
always
rons
in
hagerstown
a
murky
brown
the
smell
is
of
figs
dates
toffee
and
all
around
fruitcake
flavors
first
sip
evokes
memories
of
dried
fruits
and
various
forms
of
sugarbrown
sugar
honey
turbunado
sugar
on
and
on
it
seems
that
the
sweetness
can
morph
into
whatever
style
of
sugar
my
brain
wants
the
dried
fruits
complement
this
well
a
rich
thick
brew
the
mouthfeel
is
heavy
and
rich
and
a
7
ounce
pour
was
perfect
a
great
strong
ale
for
the
christmas
time
overall
a
good
winter
warmer
and
worth
your
time
like
the
aroma
the
taste
is
alive
with
toasty
malts
dark
fruit
molasses
and
raisins
but
it
ends
with
a
big
lingering
hop
bite
at
the
finish
some
alcohol
burn
drinkability
a
nice
sipper
for
a
cold
eve
because
the
alcohol
doesnt
hide
too
well
as
the
brew
warms
would
i
be
seeking
it
out
at
1214
a
bottle
again
no
however
it
is
definitely
a
good
spiced
quad
dark
brown
pour
with
a
massive
head
with
excellent
lacing
that
lasts
forever
nose
is
of
dark
fruit
raisins
and
dates
against
a
malt
backbone
with
a
hint
of
spice
light
medium
body
and
very
well
carbonated
alcohol
is
well
hidden
with
dark
fruit
and
malt
flavors
spice
is
present
but
subdued
clean
finish
with
a
slight
alcoholic
bitterness
not
as
flavorful
or
smooth
as
gouden
carolus
noel
which
in
my
opinion
is
the
best
of
the
belgian
christmas
ales
the
flavors
are
certainly
in
line
with
a
quad
but
it
has
a
fruit
cake
like
thickness
that
makes
this
an
excellent
winter
holiday
beer
sweet
and
savory
notes
of
dried
candied
fruits
couple
with
malt
to
give
this
an
excellent
smoothness
even
the
mgd
drinker
at
the
table
thought
it
was
ok
great
beer
for
the
holidays
overall
it
is
what
it
is
another
competent
quad
does
that
make
it
amazing
no
still
quite
enjoyable
im
not
thrilled
with
this
im
sure
my
score
says
bad
to
mean
but
honestly
this
is
a
nice
beer
it
isnt
worth
the
1112
bucks
but
you
get
a
drinkable
beer
with
some
nice
flavors
and
it
isnt
boring
or
something
you
start
naming
clones
of
instantly
that
said
no
its
not
new
or
unique
but
hey
what
is
right
this
particular
bottle
has
been
aging
in
my
fridge
for
the
last
year
the
christmas
ale
is
bottle
conditioned
so
it
poured
with
a
generous
head
over
its
deep
ruby
brown
body
the
aroma
was
of
fruits
and
malty
sweetness
with
the
taste
following
the
same
with
some
added
complexity
and
a
slight
bitterness
on
the
palate
the
creamy
mouthfeel
rounded
out
this
truly
excellent
christmas
ale
that
is
a
fantastic
beer
for
the
holidays
overall
not
overly
sweet
or
spicy
though
there
is
a
definite
abundance
of
this
in
the
beers
character
again
probably
best
served
when
its
cold
outside
as
it
will
warm
you
right
up
bought
a
second
bottle
to
open
christmas
day
overall
i
should
have
kept
cold
i
will
not
be
buying
this
again
i
like
sweet
beers
but
this
kind
of
sweetness
is
something
else
entirely
i
have
tried
most
of
the
st
bernardus
offerings
and
i
have
to
rate
abt
12
number
one
followed
by
the
tripel
then
the
pater
6
and
watou
tripel
this
christmas
ale
i
will
lump
in
with
the
prior
8
and
the
wit
as
beers
i
will
probably
never
have
again
o
very
enjoyable
had
on
tap
at
osdh
denton
on
world
beard
day
loved
it
very
warming
although
we
were
sitting
in
a
humid
texas
evening
it
was
still
very
nice
and
comforting
i
remember
thinking
that
i
needed
to
take
smaller
sips
an
extremely
sweet
beer
with
a
very
strong
mouthfeel
and
such
a
high
abv
definitely
indicated
so
soothing
velvety
christmasy
the
sweetness
reminded
me
of
a
concentrated
caramel
syrup
but
in
the
best
way
possible
in
beer
one
of
my
favorites
the
definitive
belgian
christmas
beer

very
well

with
only
a

after

overall
this
is
a
highly
excellent
belgian
strong
dark
ale
great
balance
and
complexity
of

esters
with
malt
sweetness
and
very
smooth
and
crisp
to
sip
on
for
10
a
highly
enjoyable
offering
overall
i
thought
this
was
quite
complex
and
enjoyable
pretty
much
what
i
would
expect
out
of
st
bernardus
d
great
balanced
quad
good
mix
of
yeast
and
malt
flavors
not
sure
what
was
going
on
with
this
but
i
wasnt
all
that
impressed
the
rest
fantastic
a
terrific
quad
with
big
bold
flavors
yet
with
layers
of
subtlety
i
love
this
beer
and
im
one
of
few
that
likes
this
better
than
the
abt
12
poured
a
beautiful
deep
dark
color
with
two
fingers
of
rich
off
white
head
gorgeous
scents
of
dark
fruit
banana
alcohol
and
belgian
yeast
the
flavor
is
excellent
dark
fruit
raisins
chocolate
belgian
sugar
slight
hints
of
alcohol
and
peppery
notes
are
present
light
carbonation
and
a
sticky
let
drinkable
body
lead
to
an
excellent
mouthfeel
a
fantastic
belgian
by
far
one
of
my
absolute
favorites
a
great
christmas
beer
not
quite
as
good
as
abt
12
but
still
one
of
st
bernardus
better
offerings
a
good
beer
that
i
most
likely
will
buy
again
during
the
christmas
season
it
is
important
that
i
mention
that
this
particular
ale
has
an
abv
of
10
so
i
would
caution
anyone
to
be
very
judicious
when
imbibing
this
great
brew
to
either
be
home
or
have
a
designated
driver
cheers
o
bernardus
is
in
my
top
5
favorites
and
this
beer
does
not
disappoint
softerflatter
on
tap
versus
bottle
but
im
glad
i
had
the
chance
to
get
it
on
tap
kegs
are
without
conditioning
so
the
experiences
are
different
this
is
an
exceptionally
good
beer
its
very
alcoholic
but
its
wellhidden
easy
to
drink
i
wish
this
wasnt
a
seasonal
unless
i
crack
open
a
bottle
of
westy
12
thats
been
aging
for
a
year
i
already
know
this
is
the
best
beer
ill
have
this
year
o
this
beer
has
everything
i
want
in
a
quad
except
for
the
taste
they
really
lost
me
on
it
looks
perfect
smells
amazing
taste
just
isnt
there
for
me
not
feeling
this
one
st
bernardus
merry
fucking
christmas
oa
delicious
christmas
beer
to
savor
during
the
cold
months
o
a
heavy
beer
so
it
took
me
a
while
i
savored
it
thought
this
is
one
of
the
best
i
have
ever
had
o
another
fantastic
beer
from
st
bernardus
deep
and
complex
a
great
beer
to
sip
over
a
long
evening
certainly
one
of
the
best
belgian
beers
ive
had
on
tap
at
pizza
port
in
ocean
beach
transcribed
from
121212
tasting
notes
this
is
a
nice
malty
beer
where
the
yeast
does
a
great
job
imparting
spice
and
character
the
abv
was
well
hidden
there
was
great
balance
and
drinkability
and
it
has
a
solid
all
around
flavor
profile
this
is
definitely
a
winter
beer
worth
checking
out
i
hadnt
had
this
in
a
while
so
i
figured
id
give
it
another
spin
slightly
hazed
ruddy
brown
pour
with
a
small
cap
of
offwhite
head
that
retained
well
and
left
a
bit
of
lacing
on
the
snifter
nice
aroma
toasted
bread
light
spice
yeast
peach
and
pear
taste
reflected
the
nose
caramel
malts
yeast
brown
sugar
allspice
candied
fruits
its
an
easy
drinker
mediumbodied
crisp
flavorful
some
boozy
heat
but
as
it
is
a
10
quad
you
have
to
expect
that
a
little
overall
ive
said
it
before
and
ill
say
it
again
spectacular
keep
it
for
special
occasions
overall
delicious
lovely
drinkable
treat
i
cant
believe
ive
never
had
it
until
now
this
is
my
interpretation
of
a
perfect
christmas
ale
a
very
welldone
holiday
beer
big
and
beautiful
with
excellent
balance
and
complexity
festive
flavors
abound
and
make
for
a
near
perfect
beer
to
sip
on
a
cold
winter
afternoon
while
sitting
with
a
crackling
hardwood
fire
nearby
overall
a
great
belgian
winter
beer
cant
wait
to
drink
this
one
again
at
10
this
is
a
real
piece
of
work
there
is
some
bitterness
to
contend
with
but
its
actually
a
nice
part
of
the
overall
taste
not
as
smooth
and
delicious
as
the
others
but
an
appreciative
craft
of
art
and
its
on
tap
at
the
local
belgian
pub
i
gotta
get
down
there
soon
this
is
the
best
christmas
ale
i
have
had
everyone
should
try
this
beer
it
doesnt
matter
if
you
like
or
dislike
beer
this
is
one
of
those
brews
that
could
turn
a
miller
lite
drinker
into
a
craft
beerbelgian
ale
lover
over
night
get
out
grab
a
glass
and
raise
it
to
the
sky
overall
this
was
excellent
merry
crimus
one
of
my
favorite
belgian
christmas
beers
if
not
my
favorite
so
rich
and
decadent
unreal
good
poured
from
22oz
caged
bottle
into
pint
glass
new
bottle
i
think
pours
a
deep
mahogany
brown
with
slight
off
white
head
nice
deep
dried
fruit
typical
belgian
dubbel
aromas
bu
mixed
with
big
spice
character
taste
is
of
dried
fruit
and
lots
of
spices
nutmeg
cinnamon
etc
its
a
bit
heavy
on
the
spice
but
its
still
excellent
deff
worth
having
and
a
great
brew
for
the
holiday
season
this
would
probbaly
mellow
a
bit
with
some
age
o
this
beer
hits
harder
than
the
rest
of
the
st
bernardus
line
it
treats
the
palate
a
little
more
roughly
and
the
alcohol
presence
is
not
as
well
hidden
thats
not
a
bad
thing
for
a
big
winter
beer
though
i
really
enjoyed
this
christmas
offering
it
has
all
the
complexity
one
could
want
and
it
retains
that
distinct
st
bernardus
house
taste
an
excellent
fireside
sipper
for
sure
overall
this
is
really
one
of
the
best
beers
i
have
ever
had
just
so
much
going
on
and
all
the
flavors
and
characteristics
are
perfectly
balanced
dangerously
drinkable
and
one
to
really
savor
during
the
holidays
pours
a
dark
ruddy
amber
with
a
thick
head
and
minimal
lacing
smells
of
spices
raisins
plums
cherries
and
brown
sugar
taste
is
more
spices
dark
fruits
brown
sugar
and
molasses
mouthfeel
is
smooth
with
medium
carbonation
and
a
dry
finish
overall
a
fantastic
christmas
ale
my
new
favorite
which
is
a
nice
alternative
to
the
abt
12
alcohol
is
well
hidden
for
10
abv
merry
christmas
poured
into
a
duvel
tulip
glass
pours
dark
caramel
brown
with
a
thick
eggshell
colored
head
that
dissipates
slowly
plenty
of
lacing
is
left
on
the
side
of
the
glass
during
consumption
there
are
aromas
of
banana
spices
such
as
cinnamon
and
clove
malt
fig
and
some
caramel
sweetness
the
malt
backbone
is
bready
and
mildly
sweet
with
banana
cinnamon
clove
and
fig
the
10
alcohol
is
well
hidden
in
this
beer
saying
the
taste
follows
the
nose
is
true
but
it
also
understates
the
execution
of
the
wellbalanced
and
complex
flavors
in
this
beer
one
flavor
does
not
dominate
the
other
the
beer
is
medium
to
full
bodied
with
strong
carbonation
this
makes
the
beer
smooth
and
dangerously
drinkable
if
you
are
looking
for
a
great
belgian
strong
dark
ale
this
is
a
great
place
to
begin
a
well
made
strong
dark
ale
for
any
season
another
great
brew
from
good
ol
st
bernardus
overall
one
of
the
better
christmas
ales
to
come
out
of
belgium
my
bottle
was
a
bit
undercarbonated
but
still
quite
good
first
taste
i
can
tell
this
is
an
ongoing
complexity
raisin
bread
pudding
and
sweet
dark
fruit
date
raisin
nutty
and
with
nutmeg
some
peppering
with
a
long
burning
finish
pretty
well
carbonated
this
sipper
was
a
great
choice
for
a
christmas
beer
complex
strong
nice
seasonal
flavoring
would
recommend
to
anyone
especially
those
who
enjoy
abby
beers
to
try
christmastime
or
anytime
during
the
winter
o
its
a
great
beer
but
doesnt
seem
to
be
anything
crazy
or
special
spot
on
for
the
style
though
spiced
enough
to
make
this
feel
like
a
holiday
ale
o
belgian
abbey
with
christmas
spices
o
very
nicely
developed
flavors
with
some
hidden
booze
definitely
drank
like
it
was
78
i
would
have
liked
a
little
less
carbonation
to
smooth
out
the
mouthfeel
but
overall
it
was
very
nice
rjt
overall
a
really
delicious
bsda
and
christmas
beer
really
great
tasting
and
nicely
complex
o
good
belgian
christmas
ale
o
for
the
money
i
would
rather
buy
the
abt
this
is
a
decent
beer
but
not
worth
13
this
is
one
of
my
favorite
christmas
brews
pours
a
nice
dark
brown
with
several
inches
of
head
a
nose
of
banana
raisin
and
cloves
flavor
of
raisins
figs
and
a
tad
boozy
very
malty
with
little
to
no
hop
presence
has
a
nice
velvet
mouth
feel
o
pretty
tasty
dont
know
that
im
going
to
actively
seek
it
out
every
year
but
certainly
enjoyable
a
solid
christmastime
bsda
that
acts
as
a
wonderful
winter
warmer
one
of
the
things
i
like
about
most
bsdas
are
their
complex
flavor
profiles
and
this
one
is
no
different
lots
of
things
going
on
but
they
work
together
well
drinkability
a
very
good
beer
in
the
style
belgian
strong
ale
to
drink
at
cellar
temperature
o
a
delicious
beer
the
flavors
are
rich
and
complex
with
a
subtle
spice
thats
really
spot
on
bernardus
makes
a
great
beer
including
this
one
there
is
great
balance
going
on
this
is
an
excellent
christmas
beer
o
one
of
the
best
christmas
beers
i
have
ever
had
somewhat
dry
and
not
too
sweet
the
flavours
of
the
yeast
are
fantastic
huge
body
and
tons
of
carbonation
very
lively
and
strong
brew
with
a
velvet
like
texture
only
minor
complaint
would
be
that
its
almost
too
bubbly
and
it
gets
in
the
way
of
the
flavors
i
prefer
the
southern
tier
2xmas
for
the
season
easy
drinking
and
an
excellent
spice
finish
st
bernardus
christmas
ale
pours
a
very
dark
mahogany
with
a
handful
of
cherry
highlights
roughly
two
fingers
of
bone
colored
foam
crown
the
beer
but
head
retention
and
lacing
are
both
a
bit
disappointing
the
nose
displays
a
nice
ester
and
phenol
balance
theres
plenty
of
dark
fruit
in
the
aroma
with
a
solid
yet
secondary
spicy
quality
to
it
theres
not
as
much
fruitiness
as
far
as
the
flavor
goes
theres
a
bit
of
plum
but
overall
the
sweetness
is
more
caramel
than
anything
else
the
clove
phenol
character
is
a
bit
more
potent
here
perhaps
just
a
little
too
much
for
my
taste
theres
also
a
warming
but
not
hot
booziness
that
lingers
a
little
bit
cant
argue
with
the
mouthfeel
though
as
the
beer
is
wonderfully
dried
out
and
drinkable
for
10
and
the
carbonation
has
plenty
of
life
to
it
the
christmas
ale
isnt
the
most
impressive
beer
in
st
bernarduss
repertoire
but
its
still
a
fairly
solid
strong
belgian
brew
overall
it
was
much
sweeter
and
lighter
than
i
expected
for
a
christmas
ale
but
i
liked
it
i
dont
know
if
it
is
the
taste
mouth
feel
or
just
the
glass
but
it
reminds
me
of
a
good
wine
it
taste
lighter
than
an
10
abv
but
i
got
a
nice
little
buzz
from
one
bottle
a
93
o
this
brewery
produces
some
awesome
beer
for
sure
and
this
is
one
of
the
many
examples
o
not
a
whole
lot
about
this
beer
says
specifically
christmas
but
theres
a
lot
that
says
winter
the
spices
are
warm
the
alcohol
is
warm
the
beer
is
thick
and
sweet
and
delicious
honestly
no
single
part
of
this
beer
stands
out
to
me
but
the
whole
is
greater
than
the
sum
of
its
parts
overall
quite
tasty
of
fruit
warming
and
just
the
right
amount
of
spice
a
delicious
winter
warmer
o
excellent
strong
belgian
christmas
ale
great
flavors
aroma
and
mouth
feel
overall
nice
dits
goodits
real
good
the
first
few
drinks
the
warmth
of
the
alcohol
was
noticeable
but
that
quickly
faded
i
think
its
less
boozy
than
the
abt
12
very
good
typical
st
bernardus
with
some
seasonal
spices
o
what
a
nearly
perfect
beer
for
those
who
love
strong
abbey
ales
and
i
do
could
drink
this
from
the
macys
parade
to
first
day
of
spring
this
pours
an
opaque
brown
and
smells
like
belgium
yeast
an
then
sweet
it
tastes
belgiumy
and
is
sweet
and
malty
it
had
good
carbonation
and
a
medium
body
overall
i
would
recommend
if
you
can
find
it
but
its
seasonal
and
i
got
it
after
christmas
cant
go
wrong
with
this
beer
though
the
high
carbonation
did
detract
from
the
otherwise
amazing
experience
o
i
think
st
bernardus
christmas
is
a
fantastic
beer
it
is
one
of
the
very
first
good
beers
and
perhaps
the
very
first
great
belgian
beer
ive
ever
had
and
has
always
lived
up
to
my
first
memories
of
how
good
it
was
this
is
the
beer
that
makes
santa
go
ho
ho
ho
o
really
really
good
i
could
drink
this
all
christmas
alcohol
is
so
hidden
special
beer
o
those
monks
sure
can
brew
beers
excellent
from
top
to
bottom
i
think
i
like
this
more
than
the
abt
12
merry
christmas
this
is
the
perfect
belgian
ale
the
10
abv
creeps
up
slowly
it
is
so
perfectly
balanced
with
intense
caramel
and
spiced
sweet
apple
dark
fruits
vanilla
and
notes
of
banana
esters
with
a
lingering
tartness
similar
to
a
freshly
baked
apple
pie
my
concept
of
perfection
sweet
fruitiness
caramelized
burnt
sugar
and
cinnamon
spice
with
no
hoppy
bitterness
to
spoil
the
experience
on
my
death
bed
i
want
a
bottle
of
st
bernardus
christmas
ale
then
at
my
wake
i
want
everyone
to
drink
st
bernardus
christmas
ale
until
they
pass
out
to
remember
me
by
beer
advocate
is
a
great
place
to
learn
about
beer
but
they
should
allow
pictures
of
beer
poured
into
a
glass
which
is
way
more
important
than
the
appearance
of
the
bottle
poured
into
a
tulip
glass
color
was
a
nice
dark
reddish
color
with
a
frothy
dirty
white
head
small
traces
of
carbonation
rising
from
the
bottom
in
a
few
places
head
clung
to
the
sides
nicely
and
then
lasted
a
bit
aroma
was
sweet
slightly
fruity
had
hints
of
a
mid
range
wine
as
well
with
just
tad
of
alcohol
flavor
was
fruity
sweet
but
not
overly
so
a
small
bit
of
spice
hiding
in
there
but
reminded
me
very
much
of
a
barleywine
coated
the
mouth
extremely
well
felt
nice
and
rich
and
creamy
with
just
a
hit
of
carbonation
in
the
mouth
overall
a
solid
beer
hid
the
abv
well
but
was
definitely
a
sipper
and
most
likely
suitable
for
cold
weather

drinkability
great
beer
and
easily
drinkable
you
can
drink
this
beer
pretty
much
year
round
may
be
a
little
heavy
for
summer
though
od
lovely
stuff
rich
and
malty
i
can
imagine
loving
this
with
snow
coming
down
good
stuff
tad
sweet
perhaps
originally
reviewed
12072011
o
another
solid
beer
from
st
bs
bought
as
a
gift
and
i
appreciated
it
so
much
i
bought
another
this
is
a
solid
beer
that
will
put
you
in
the
holiday
spirit
no
matter
the
season
o
this
beer
is
great
and
i
would
for
sure
buy
it
again
i
seem
to
find
beers
that
use
belgian
yeasts
a
little
too
carbonated
but
i
guess
thats
just
how
the
yeast
works
overall
a
little
sour
but
overall
a
nice
drinkable
strong
ale
from
this
brewery
will
pour
a
five
finger
cream
head
that
fades
very
slowly
leaving
some
lace
deep
opaque
brown
color
good
carbonation
and
medium
bodied
nose
is
belgian
yeast
and
flavor
is
sweet
belgian

for
a
750ml
caged
corked
bottle
from
tullys
beer
wine
wells
me
deep
walnut
brown
in
color
and
murky
poured
with
a
billowy
offwhite
foam
with
awesome
retention
that
left
huge
sheets
of
lacings
on
the
glass
spicy
aromas
hit
the
nose
first
with
sweet
estery
and
dark
malts
in
the
background
medium
bodied
with
aggressive
yet
smooth
delicate
carbonation
dark
fruit
and
banana
flavors
from
start
to
finish
with
spices
overtop
herbal
hops
come
and
go
through
the
middle
the
flavors
are
consistent
and
coexist
nicely
as
not
one
flavor
overwhelms
the
others
finishes
semidry
with
a
light
yeasty
and
spicy
aftertaste
while
a
very
strong
beer
there
is
no
taste
of
alcohol
and
even
with
the
cherries
honey
and
spices
this
is
not
a
sweet
beer
either
this
is
great
for
the
holiday
season
o
very
drinkable
and
tasty
beer
exactly
what
you
expect
from
a
st
bernardus
beer
an
excellent
beer
o
i
really
enjoyed
this
one
i
actually
liked
it
better
than
abt
12
which
i
was
pleasantly
surprised
at
i
definitely
look
forward
to
trying
this
one
again
next
christmas
o
pretty
good
belgium
brew
that
has
some
good
flavors
i
will
always
grab
one
around
christmas
time
this
a
definitely
a
beer
worth
drinking
again
and
again
if
you
can
find
it
and
want
to
shell
out
the
bucks
overall
an
ok
beer
but
not
too
great
their
quad
is
much
better
m
o
full
bodied
beer
for
sure
but
smooth
and
sweet
the
malt
finish
fading
out
slowly
lingering
what
a
tasty
brew
this
was
if
this
is
fresh
then
it
is
a
tremendous
recipe
i
really
do
think
this
is
the
second
best
beer
ive
had
from
this
brewery
after
the
60th
anniversary
saint
bernardus
christmas
is
a
true
belgian
classic
and
one
that
will
be
finding
its
way
into
my
glass
a
good
deal
more
often
highly
recommend
d
overall
another
solid
beer
from
st
bernardus
malty
and
rich
with
classic
components
o
refreshing
and
drinkable
considering
the
abv
nice
alcohol
warmth
with
a
good
flavor
and
aroma
oa
nice
beer
nothing
super
unique
about
this
one
but
would
like
to
grab
another
one
to
age
and
let
sit
good
all
around
bsda
with
nice
flavors
would
like
to
see
more
smoothness
to
this
one
but
thatll
probably
come
with
aging
this
was
my
first
christmas
ale
i
have
tried
and
as
usual
like
all
st
bernardus
beers
it
was
simply
amazing
the
fruits
and
chocolates
all
worked
very
well
together
tremendous
amount
of
alcohol
present
which
is
always
good
but
it
was
very
well
balanced
with
the
taste
there
is
an
amazing
head
when
poured
out
of
the
bottle
i
actually
had
to
use
my
stella
knife
to
cut
the
head
off
a
must
try
in
my
book
full
body
with
a
smooth
carbonation
finishes
strong
and
sweet
way
too
rich
for
me
but
its
a
fair
belgian
winter
ale
o
quite
an
amazing
brew
if
it
werent
for
the
sweetness
i
could
make
this
a
regular
indulgence
appearance
is
deep
redbrown
some
lacing
going
on
its
nose
has
raisins
yeast
candy
brown
sugar
and
figs
a
very
robust
smelling
beer
taking
a
sip
of
this
strong
dark
ale
and
i
taste
spices
from
the
winter
season
such
as
cinnamon
and
clove
along
with
some
more
dark
fruits
mf
leans
towards
full
the
alcohol
does
not
really
hide
sip
this
one
and
enjoy
on
a
cold
winter
day
o
a
great
winter
sipper
complex
and
delicious
another
superb
ale
from
st
bernardus
mmmm
a
decent
beer
but
not
as
complex
as
i
was
expecting
i
have
had
several
beers
of
this
style
and
it
doesnt
quite
match
up
to
the
best
of
them
still
it
is
a
nice
beer
to
drink
on
a
cold
night
and
glad
i
tried
it
poured
from
a
75
co
bottle
into
a
goblet
2010
edition
this
pours
a
slightly
hazy
dark
tea
color
with
a
decent
white
head
which
dissipates
quickly
the
smells
are
of
belgium
yeast
esters
dark
fruit
and
spices
feel
is
very
high
carbonation
medium
feel
the
taste
is
good
pretty
malts
lots
of
ripe
dark
fruit
a
little
alcohol
burn
but
tasty
o
i
was
pretty
disappointed
with
this
bottle
as
i
felt
the
carbonation
was
extremely
high
compared
to
what
it
should
be
i
have
one
more
bottle
in
my
cellar
that
i
hope
to
enjoy
sometime
in
the
near
future
if
its
less
carbonated
i
intend
to
possibly
change
the
review
i
liked
the
flavors
that
were
coming
through
however
mouthfeel
is
full
bodied
with
high
carbonation
levels
overall
this
is
a
great
brew
that
goes
down
wonderfully
besides
the
lack
of
balance
everything
works
together
in
great
ways
definitely
one
of
the
finer
christmas
beer
offerings
o
great
beer
not
much
more
to
say
d
if
i
didnt
know
what
i
was
drinking
i
wouldnt
have
said
this
had
anything
to
do
with
christmas
no
real
christmas
spice
note
for
me
but
thats
no
bad
thing
would
have
liked
to
taste
more
malt
depthcomplexity
but
overall
tasty
and
deceptively
smooth
no
alcohol
heat
at
all
dangerous
stuff
and
potentially
one
to
age
d
my
first
bsda
and
a
solid
one
at
that
doesnt
exactly
show
off
a
whole
lot
of
seasonal
flavors
but
i
enjoyed
it
a
lot
overall
sort
of
reminded
of
the
abt
12
but
i
liked
this
one
a
bit
more
nice
and
easy
to
drink
but
the
10
abv
is
disguised
way
too
well
this
one
will
certainly
sneak
up
on
you
easy
sipper
complex
interesting
and
enjoyable
slightly
under
the
original
abt
12
but
still
amazing
o
overall
a
great
all
around
beer
and
worthy
of
a
special
occasion
very
easy
drinkability
despite
its
indicated
alcohol
content
malty
lush
body
with
a
good
support
of
yeasty
character
makes
this
all
you
can
want
from
a
belgian
dark
ale
once
again
brouweij
of
st
bernardus
and
st
sixtus
westvlteren
seem
to
be
in
a
league
of
their
own
when
it
comes
per
style
and
overall
quality
o
as
i
have
already
mentioned
this
beer
is
very
complex
but
quite
a
bit
of
a
mess
it
still
is
decently
drinkable
and
warming
but
its
musty
herbal
character
just
not
gets
in
the
line
with
its
dry
malt
character
i
didnt
notice
bad
or
completely
off
flavours
nor
any
other
major
issue
so
im
reviewing
it
pours
a
murky
dark
brown
with
a
huge
3
inch
foamy
beige
head
that
settles
to
a
small
cap
base
on
the
first
pour
i
got
mostly
foam
so
i
think
there
may
an
issue
with
the
carbonation
on
this
one
a
latticework
of
thin
rings
lines
the
glass
on
the
drink
down
smell
is
of
bready
malt
brown
sugar
and
some
dark
fruits
taste
is
very
much
the
same
with
a
nice
flavor
of
dark
fruits
raisins
plums
etc
on
the
finish
like
i
suspected
based
on
the
pour
this
beer
has
an
extremely
high
level
of
carbonation
with
a
very
crisp
and
bubbly
mouthfeel
way
overcarbonated
in
my
opinion
but
without
any
indicators
of
infection
or
the
like
overall
this
is
a
good
bsda
and
a
very
nice
beer
to
sip
on
for
christmas
night
but
the
mouthfeel
brings
down
my
enjoyment
of
this
beer
a
perfect
christmas
beer
sweet
and
spicy
upfront
and
dry
and
satisfying
on
the
finish
overall
personally
i
do
not
find
this
ale
nearly
as
balanced
as
the
abt
12
it
is
a
great
christmas
beer
but
maybe
not
as
quite
as
good
compared
to
others
ive
recently
had
see
my
other
reviews
i
love
the
cherries
in
this
beer
and
i
certainly
appreciate
the
label
fairly
festive
and
the
dried
fruits
and
cherries
really
bring
out
an
interesting
quality
to
this
a
solid
christmas
ale
mo
what
a
great
beer
im
halfway
down
my
glass
and
it
just
keeps
tasting
better
the
foamy
head
has
calmed
down
but
is
still
thick
and
creamy
got
this
for
christmas
from
my
wife
and
now
want
to
go
out
and
get
some
more
o
overall
a
very
nice
belgianchristmas
ale
overall
another
great
belgian
christmas
ale
not
too
much
difference
among
the
three
i
tried
and
all
are
worthy
o
fantastic
ive
made
this
beer
a
part
of
my
christmas
morning
traditions
a
perfect
beer
for
the
holidays
i
enjoy
just
sitting
by
the
tree
and
indulging
on
the
rich
sweet
taste
of
this
beer
the
dark
fruit
bread
and
spice
elements
all
blend
to
create
an
amazing
christmas
experience
overall
a
very
good
belgian
dark
ale
and
one
of
the
best
christmas
beers
in
the
world
great
use
of
dark
fruits
and
spices
o
awesome
beer
it
is
in
my
opinion
a
little
better
then
the
12
its
just
like
the
twelve
but
with
a
slight
christmas
kick
notes
super
this
is
really
good
stuff
ive
had
5
different
beers
by
st
bernardus
and
love
3
of
them
pater
6
abt
12
and
this
christmas
ale
d
a
delicious
belgian
dark
from
a
brewery
that
doesnt
really
make
a
bad
beer
wouldnt
hate
to
see
this
year
round
dangerously
drinkable
and
hard
to
detect
the
10abv
on
this
tasty
treat
m
rounded
with
incredible
depth
and
balance
tastes
like
its
been
aging
for
years
o
a
great
christmas
beer
that
i
recommend
to
anyone
who
likes
these
types
of
beers
overall
excellent
beer
as
above
i
could
do
without
the
bitterness
but
its
a
great
christmas
beer
o
i
liked
this
but
it
didnt
overwhelm
me
4
34
finger
medium
brown
head
slow
dissipation
with
some
lacing
over
dark
brown
opaque
body
one
of
the
best
smelling
beers
ive
had
in
a
long
time
pronounced
stone
fruit
presence
plums
raisins
red
currants
a
little
bit
of
pluots
balanced
nicely
with
floral
hop
aromas
taste
features
the
above
stone
fruit
profile
with
healthy
dose
of
caramel
malt
or
dark
candi
sugar
which
provided
quite
a
bit
of
residual
sweetness
mouthfeel
is
well
on
the
full
side
of
medium
good
effervescence
a
surprisingly
astringent
mouthfeel
given
the
inherent
sweetness
this
has
to
be
one
of
the
worlds
best
christmas
beers
especially
when
aged
though
drinkablility
is
a
bit
impaired
by
high
abv
o
this
is
a
very
tasty
beer
the
most
interesting
thing
is
the
way
the
fruity
and
peppery
esters
separate
from
each
other
makes
for
a
very
pleasant
beer
i
will
need
to
have
this
again
before
the
holidays
are
through
probably
more
than
once
st
bernardus
christmas
ale
does
all
that
world
class
belgain
strong
ales
are
expected
to
and
with
many
extraordinary
nuances
to
set
it
apart
from
the
mere
good
ones
an
absolute
delight
with
each
sip
as
new
flavors
reveal
themselves
with
each
visit
to
the
glass
the
descriptor
words
for
this
beer
are
seemingly
endless
tastes
like
it
smells
only
good
god
it
is
as
smooth
as
red
velvet
cake
caramel
gets
overtaken
by
fruit
which
gets
overtaken
by
spice
which
gets
overtaken
by
boozy
burn
and
then
everything
ends
on
more
spice
but
then
even
after
that
there
lingers
silky
smooth
fruit
with
more
bananas
and
the
burn
holy
heaven
above
the
burn
does
not
abate
this
is
a
big
bold
beer
with
a
lot
going
on
id
like
to
store
one
of
these
for
a
year
to
see
the
difference
o
a
nice
strong
dark
ale
with
a
nice
crispy
spicy
flavor
bottle
a
deep
red
beer
with
a
thin
tan
head
the
aroma
has
notes
of
over
ripe
fruits
yeast
spices
alcohol
prunes
and
a
bit
of
wood
the
flavor
is
sweet
with
notes
of
malt
caramel
alcohol
over
ripe
fruits
prunes
and
yeast
leading
to
a
dry
alcoholic
finish
the
alcohol
prickles
the
tongue
o
seems
like
an
effervescent
imperial
saison
with
some
holiday
spices
quite
pleasant
a
nice
holiday
diversion
everything
requisite
for
a
strong
belgian
christmas
ale
is
present
toffee
cinnamon
treacle
and
clove
good
balance
with
a
firm
bitterness
sweetness
and
alcohol
creep
up
after
the
first
glass
earthiness
emerges
after
it
warms
up
in
the
glass
nice
beer
but
its
more
expensive
than
abt
12
sitting
right
next
to
it
on
the
shelf
and
we
all
know
that
one
is
world
class
a
true
classic
and
a
beer
ill
never
tire
of
drinking
if
ive
got
the
next
day
off
lovely
smooth
medium
body
not
a
bunch
of
carb
that
i
was
expecting
since
it
blew
the
cork
off
thats
prob
where
some
of
it
went
leaves
a
little
tongue
tingle
overall
truly
fantastic
i
couldnt
expect
much
more
from
st
bernardus
tastes
a
little
like
abt
12
with
spices
a
good
sipper
for
a
cold
winter
night
ok
ever
made
that
root
beer
float
and
had
the
head
that
just
took
a
few
to
go
away
that
is
how
this
poured
i
am
currently
at
the
end
of
the
bottle
and
there
is
still
some
lacing
sticking
around
the
pint
glass
for
me
this
has
just
enough
of
the
hops
and
toffeechocolate
to
keep
me
coming
back
for
another
and
i
am
wanting
a
second
bottle
at
the
moment
i
will
be
back
for
another
of
these
and
will
be
looking
for
other
st
bernardus
bottles
in
the
local
markets
a
must
try
and
a
great
winter
warmer
cant
imagine
a
better
winter
warmer
this
pours
a
tanbrown
color
it
has
a
spicy
aromai
pick
up
a
lot
of
the
socalled
holiday
spice
mix
blendedbalanced
with
an
estery
belgianstyle
aroma
upon
tasting
i
find
cinnamon
and
cloves
dominate
along
with
an
underlying
belgian
quad
taste
warms
nicely
with
little
hint
of
its
strength
tasty
oim
actually
surprised
at
how
drinkable
this
beer
is
it
goes
down
very
easily
for
the
high
abv
as
i
drink
it
more
the
flavors
in
the
aftertaste
seem
to
come
out
more
its
not
my
favorite
christmas
brew
but
it
isnt
bad
ill
get
this
again
some
time
but
next
id
like
to
share
the
750ml
possibly
this
is
great
beer
though
a
must
try
overall
its
a
bit
reminiscent
of
at
the
risk
of
being
simplistic
a
spiced
version
of
the
abt
12
which
i
would
prefer
a
very
good
christmas
ale
just
nothing
overly
spectacular
o
ive
always
been
a
fan
of
both
st
bernardus
and
this
style
so
i
really
wanted
to
like
this
beer
unfortunately
i
just
couldnt
the
overwhelming
alcohol
presence
and
heavy
mouthfeel
ruined
this
one
for
me
i
doubt
ill
be
purchasing
this
beer
again
super
carbonated
belgian
ale
just
in
time
for
this
holiday
season
pours
a
slightly
clouded
mahogany
brown
burgundy
color
with
a
light
khaki
tan
head
forming
thick
and
fully
bubbled
aroma
is
full
of
christmas
spices
meaning
hints
of
cinnamon
ginger
and
other
famous
pie
spices
full
on
flavor
of
ripened
fruits
and
sweet
bursting
dessert
like
bready
pie
crust
fruit
filled
with
spices
galore
this
is
some
big
festive
drinking
christmas
ale
full
on
honey
tinged
ripened
fruit
with
hints
of
papaya
pineapple
tartness
with
bittering
hoiday
spices
balancing
out
the
pure
sweetness
of
this
big
belgian
ale
alcoholic
slight
medicinal
burn
in
each
sip
with
high
carbonation
this
really
tickles
the
nares
but
the
effervescent
carbonation
carries
things
well
and
it
finishes
with
bitter
dry
holiday
spices
wonderful
amazing
freak
of
nature
belgian
christmas
bier
that
we
all
look
forward
to
each
year
drink
i
really
liked
this
beer
it
was
a
good
way
to
end
the
evening
with
friends
for
a
xmas
party
in
the
beginning
of
dec
i
wouldshould
go
get
another
bottle
of
this
one
to
age
till
next
year
judged
against
other
bsdas
this
is
pretty
mediocre
as
a
christmas
ale
i
feel
just
about
the
same
poured
into
a
chalice
from
a
bomber
huge
foam
maybe
two
inches
of
thick
creamy
head
that
slowly
dissipated
to
a
nice
14
inch
layer
that
lasted
to
the
end
great
lacing
too
scent
is
dark
fruit
molasses
a
little
orange
and
clove
taste
is
similiar
dark
fruits
and
molasses
good
carbonation
with
a
medium
mouthfeel
overall
a
great
beer
i
was
defiantly
wanting
more
when
it
finished
highly
recommended
overall
impression
rich
complexed
and
a
very
wild
christmas
ale
im
definitely
stopping
by
lukas
liquor
to
pick
up
a
bottle
of
this
and
reviewenjoy
again
i
suggest
you
do
the
same
but
of
course
your
local
bottle
shop
see
if
you
can
spot
the
cherries
in
this
one
there
were
a
huge
attribute
in
this
brew
for
me
that
made
it
so
enjoyable
thanks
brouwerij
st
bernardus
fantastic
o
delightful
beer
that
i
look
forward
to
getting
next
year
as
well
pairs
nicely
with
the
summer
sausage
and
cheese
spread
ive
got
going
pours
a
dark
brown
w
a
nice
once
finger
cocoa
head
excellent
lacing
left
on
my
snifter
glass
nose
is
mainly
figs
raisin
dark
fruit
clove
and
other
spices
not
quite
as
strong
as
id
like
but
still
very
balanced
and
pleasant
taste
steps
it
up
a
notch
this
is
one
of
the
better
belgian
christmas
brews
ive
had
just
super
balanced
and
really
well
put
together
feel
is
full
smooth
and
incredibly
balanced
pretty
amazing
overall
this
is
probably
the
2
belgian
christmas
beer
ive
had
its
definitely
worth
a
buy
cheers
o
a
good
christmas
ale
but
not
so
special
it
is
over
the
top
a
not
so
good
attempt
to
make
something
good
even
better
overall
this
is
quite
nice
but
you
do
have
to
pay
attention
to
it
its
complex
but
not
a
flavor
bomb
i
cant
quite
place
why
but
it
does
feel
like
a
christmas
beer
to
me
despite
not
really
having
any
christmasy
spices
as
far
as
i
can
tell
served
with
a
smallish
cream
colored
head
and
lots
of
lace
color
is
a
cloudy
brown
amber
aroma
is
super
malty
vineous
yeast
caramel
toffee
fruit
flavors
very
similar
to
nose
with
toffee
caramel
malt
yeast
carbonic
tang
all
in
the
fore
body
and
carbonation
are
faultless
finish
is
malt
carmel
toffee
and
a
touch
of
fruit
while
of
average
length
luscious
beer
overall
fantastic
love
this
a
boat
load
of
flavor
easy
to
drink
but
this
22oz
is
plenty
a
great
once
a
year
beer
that
i
seek
out
annually
and
use
to
start
my
holidays
with
christmas
has
started
offically
for
me
great
beer
espically
for
st
bernardus
10
and
12
fans
o
very
good
beer
by
st
bernardus
complex
yet
approachable
and
high
on
the
abv
but
not
too
intense
very
good
beer
and
great
for
the
cooler
weather
ive
been
waiting
to
try
this
beer
for
a
while
but
got
totally
shut
out
last
year
750ml
corked
and
caged
bottle
served
in
my
st
bernardus
chalice
be
careful
opening
this
one
once
i
removed
the
cage
the
cork
fired
like
a
shotgun
blast
and
ricocheted
off
the
ceiling
pours
a
deep
plum
color
with
a
slightly
hazy
clarity
head
starts
off
as
a
fluffy
two
inch
creamcolored
cloud
of
foam
as
the
head
recedes
into
a
quarter
inch
cap
delicate
textured
spots
and
strands
of
lacing
are
revealed
and
exhibit
excellent
adhesion
this
beer
looks
exquisite
in
its
proper
glassware
nose
expresses
dark
fruits
with
a
slightly
vinous
character
belgian
yeast
and
some
nutty
notes
perhaps
hazelnut
taste
follows
nose
flavor
profile
is
pretty
standard
for
the
style
in
my
opinion
however
theres
a
trace
of
ethanol
that
overshadows
things
a
bit
making
it
difficult
to
tease
out
the
subtleties
i
also
get
a
little
wet
cardboard
towards
the
finish
but
it
dissipates
quickly
mouthfeel
is
lightmedium
with
a
slightly
prickly
carbonation
as
well
as
a
bit
of
gassiness
overall
a
very
solid
belgian
strong
dark
however
perhaps
a
little
young
i
would
probably
sit
on
this
vintage
for
a
couple
more
years
awesome
beer
basically
like
a
spiced
abt
12
o
very
tasty
i
love
st
berandus
i
am
really
enjoying
the
christmas
version
if
you
like
big
beers
this
will
deliver
what
you
are
craving
overall
an
incredibly
delicious
brew
and
so
fitting
for
a
christmas
setting
i
bought
two
to
see
how
one
tastes
in
the
summer
out
of
curiosity
drinkability
frankly
it
justifies
the
price
and
then
some
this
is
a
very
tasty
and
potent
holiday
beer
it
makes
an
ideal
stocking
stuffer
o
great
christmas
ale
with
abv
very
well
hidden
i
highly
recommend
it
oa
typically
classy
high
quality
beer
st
bernardus
i
expect
this
bottle
would
be
fantastic
with
a
few
more
years
on
it
opinion
as
is
usual
with
st
bernardus
products
i
have
been
really
happy
with
this
beer
it
is
great
tasting
and
has
lots
of
character
and
is
dangerously
easy
to
drink
that
said
i
think
that
i
like
their
abt12
better
just
because
this
one
comes
across
a
bit
fruity
in
the
beginning
where
i
dont
remember
that
with
the
abt12
i
am
splitting
hairs
here
if
you
havent
tried
this
beer
try
it
i
would
recommend
anything
with
st
bernardus
written
on
the
bottle
and
this
beer
is
no
exception
im
glad
that
i
finally
tried
it
got
this
beauty
from
my
nephew
kevin
dark
mahoganyruby
pour
with
huge
three
finger
head
with
great
retention
and
lacing
big
herbal
complex
nose
with
hints
of
black
cherries
metal
brown
sugar
dark
fruits
and
tobacco
the
taste
is
complex
as
well
lots
of
black
cherries
plums
and
bananas
with
a
nice
herbal
backbone
with
hints
of
cinnamon
cloves
and
vanilla
and
just
a
touch
of
chocolate
and
orange
peel
the
finish
is
crisp
and
dry
the
mouthfeel
is
carbonated
but
slightly
syrupy
the
alcohol
is
extremely
well
hidden
its
not
as
christmasy
as
i
had
hoped
but
still
a
classic
beer
from
a
great
brewery
thanks
kevin
looking
at
this
beer
you
dont
notice
any
carbonation
but
this
beer
does
have
a
carbonated
mouthfeel
this
beer
pours
out
as
a
deep
red
color
with
a
foamy
tan
colored
head
the
lacing
isnt
too
bad
here
the
smell
of
the
beer
has
a
lot
of
spice
to
it
there
is
some
decent
flavors
once
the
beer
warms
up
the
beer
right
from
the
fridge
has
a
metallic
flavor
at
first
the
spices
kick
in
and
leave
a
slight
amount
of
heat
in
the
aftertaste
the
mouthfeel
is
a
little
warming
and
had
a
lot
of
carbonation
overall
its
not
a
bad
christmas
ale
overallnotes
christmas
in
a
bottle
ive
heard
and
said
this
phrase
before
but
it
here
it
really
rings
true
it
definitely
needs
a
bit
of
warming
but
youll
be
rewarded
in
kind
with
the
exception
of
that
first
shockwave
i
had
little
to
no
complaints
about
this
ale
drink
and
be
merry
the
mouthfeel
nice
with
a
solid
full
body
and
pleasantly
well
carbonated
overall
this
is
a
fine
holiday
sipper
best
enjoyed
with
your
family
andor
friends
my
uncle
and
i
thoughly
enjoyed
this
while
the
family
rushed
to
the
kitchen
for
the
desserts
we
already
had
ours
in
our
glasses
o
a
winter
warmer
if
there
ever
was
one
its
not
the
super
spiced
up
version
that
some
go
for
but
is
more
of
a
strong
sweet
belgian
with
a
little
xmas
cheer
baked
in
well
worth
a
purchase
from
corked
and
caged
750ml
pours
a
mostly
clear
dark
reddish
brown
with
two
fingers
of
creamy
khaki
colored
foam
settles
to
a
decent
sized
clump
and
coats
the
glass
in
thick
lace
smell
quite
vinous
and
fruity
cherry
raisin
plum
brown
sugar
very
slightly
acetic
taste
brown
sugar
tartish
apple
skin
red
plum
cherry
vinous
again
feel
is
extraordinarily
creamy
but
is
also
massively
carbonated
which
boots
the
flavors
from
the
tongue
too
early
though
the
high
carbonation
and
the
decent
but
nondescript
hopping
keeps
it
from
being
really
sweet
it
might
just
be
me
or
this
bottle
but
this
one
seems
like
a
combo
of
a
bsda
with
a
mild
flanders
red
interesting
but
odd
best
by
72815
so
bottled
72810
o
super
glad
i
had
an
opportunity
to
taste
this
one
and
i
would
highly
recommend
anyone
in
a
festive
mood
grab
a
bottle
and
share
the
experience
with
a
fellow
ba
tons
of
flavours
and
the
high
abv
goes
nearly
undetected
making
for
a
fantastic
experience
cheers
for
the
beer
joe
d
very
drinkable
considering
the
alcohol
content
very
well
made
world
class
overall
an
interesting
beer
thats
well
worth
picking
up
sizable
head
drops
down
to
a
lattelike
foam
this
ale
is
nearly
black
in
color
as
well
candied
fruit
plum
pudding
hint
of
broth
burnt
sugar
and
mulling
spices
scream
xmas
to
the
nose
carbonation
smoothes
the
palate
silky
with
a
delicate
but
thick
medium
body
malt
character
is
on
the
dry
side
for
the
most
part
a
smattering
of
caramel
is
in
the
middle
a
bit
hoppy
with
a
side
of
phenols
all
of
which
go
herbal
alcohol
is
pretty
tame
for
10
percentit
warms
but
does
not
rake
the
taste
buds
too
much
fruity
spicy
and
yeasty
with
hints
of
dark
sugar
and
some
earthy
yeast
in
the
drying
finish
super
complex
yet
still
a
sipper
this
ale
is
waiting
to
be
thrown
at
a
rich
holiday
meal
overall
a
great
beer
i
wish
i
would
have
bought
more
and
now
its
all
sold
out
i
am
getting
at
least
2
bottles
next
year
this
is
one
of
the
very
best
christmaswinter
seasonals
i
have
had
i
highly
recommend
this
one
the
75
cl
bottle
is
perfect
size
for
two
people
poured
from
750ml
bottle
into
a
heavy
chalice
glass
a
murky
caramelorange
hue
huge
amounts
of
offwhite
frothy
head
that
is
effervescent
and
mostly
sustaining
splatters
of
lacing
s
nose
is
dark
fruits
sweet
belgian
candy
alcohol
green
apples
and
spices
t
initial
taste
is
dark
fruits
followed
by
spritzy
spices
peppermint
and
bananas
finishes
with
sweetness
and
alcohol
warming
m
fullbodied
thick
chewy
texture
ampedup
carbonation
d
smooth
and
balanced
strong
ale
milder
spice
flavors
and
lively
carbonation
contribute
to
a
unique
taste
profile
very
easy
one
of
my
top
winter
brews
strangely
enough
i
am
not
a
fan
of
this
flavor
but
this
is
a
well
put
together
brew
i
wouldnt
want
this
again
but
i
can
see
the
reasons
why
people
would
have
this
beer
again
no
problem
not
a
typical
christmas
ale
by
any
means
very
original
sensation
from
start
to
finish
but
this
wasnt
my
kind
of
beer
and
at
11
for
a
750ml
bottle
i
dont
think
ill
be
picking
one
up
next
year
d
this
is
terrific
and
definitely
the
best
abbeystyle
christmas
ale
overall
a
real
nice
christmas
ale
that
i
will
surely
pick
up
each
year
from
now
on
not
a
superstar
but
just
a
really
solid
enjoyable
beer
like
i
expected
anything
else
from
st
bernardus
d
very
good
a
nice
holiday
offering
though
i
wasnt
blown
away
by
it
a
nice
beer
with
plenty
of
flavour
balanced
with
just
enough
dryness
to
make
it
drinkable
d
killer
killer
stuff
i
love
it
what
else
can
i
say
one
of
if
not
the
best
xmas
brew
ever
carbonation
seems
a
little
too
high
for
these
flavours
very
good
grab
a
bottle
pours
a
rich
ruddy
brown
with
a
nice
thin
head
and
fine
lacing
nose
is
fairly
subdued
with
yeastydark
bread
chocolate
and
fruitcake
notes
fairly
rich
and
sweet
on
the
attack
but
the
body
isnt
as
heavy
compared
to
the
abt
12
this
is
less
weighty
and
fairly
drinkable
mouthfeel
lacks
some
weight
and
richness
one
would
expect
from
this
style
a
little
more
density
would
help
to
balance
the
10
abv
still
the
pedigree
shows
with
excellent
purity
in
the
dark
maltyeastytoffee
flavors
a
fine
xmas
ale
for
a
winter
night
but
by
no
means
transcendent
overall
this
is
a
very
solid
brew
not
as
good
as
the
original
abt
but
tasty
nonetheless
4
25
jd
d
there
is
a
slight
taste
of
alcohol
but
the
10
is
masked
pretty
well
making
it
highly
drinkable
very
good
offering
and
a
must
try
bsda
drinkability
on
this
is
a
must
have
for
any
belgian
beer
fan
i
will
procure
another
bottle
and
cellar
it
i
can
only
imagine
how
much
smoother
and
silkier
this
brew
will
get
with
time
pours
a
dark
plum
color
under
a
fluffy
light

of

rich
berry
and
fig
caramelized
sugar
faint
vanilla
bean
and
warm
spices
juicy
dark

flavor
more
yeastiness

rich
maltiness

much
the
same
with
a
bit
of
bready

at
the
core
spiced
and
toasty
raisins

really
push
forward
here

the
alcohol

is
apparent
in

here

is
thick
and

with
a
lightly
prickly

down
nicely
and
the
flavors
develop
nicely
as
it
warms
a
sipper
for
sure

keep

often
yum

carbonation
delivers
a
very
sweet
body
with
some
booziness
the
alcohol
is
not
too
hot
but
present
the
malt
is
obviously
there
but
the
fruit
profiles
along
with
rich
bready
flavors
really
dominate
with
this
one
the
yeast
has
chosen
to
put
these
to
the

and
the

is
disguised
sweet
and
rich
and
tasty
the
finish
reveals
a
little
of
the

a
bit
on
the
tangy
side
the
fruitiness
of
the
aroma
and
flavor
swings
from
fig
to

to
cherry
to
this
was
a
good
one
to
share
with
others
who
are
not
big
beer
folks
and
everyone
enjoyed
it
d
an
easy
drinking
belgian
strong
dark
ale
which
should
be
no
surprise
coming
from
a
trappist
brewery
i
would
gladly
enjoy
this
offering
each
holiday
season
merry

good
beer
but
i
was
expecting
a
little
more
i
enjoyed
it
for
a
holiday
sipper
for
a
winter
day
with
family
good
beer
overall
d
good
drinkability
d
not
bad
not
bad
i
dont
think
its
amazing
but
it
is
a
pleasing
brew
and
id
probably
get
it
again
to
age
d
drink
is
good
too
but
not
outstanding
merry

drinkability
great
flavor
smooth
abv
very
well
masked
an
easy

beer
overall
while
i
would
normally
prefer
a
sweeter
less
tart
brew
this
is
an
excellent
offering
for
sampling
on
a
cold
winters
night
oh
yeah
and
the
cork
damn
near
took
my
head
off
shooting
out
of
the
bottle
this
is
a
very
tasty
beer
that
has
many
typical
belgian
characteristics
im
not
sure
what
makes
it
a
christmas
beer
orange
peel
maybe
but
its
definitely
something
to
enjoy
while
available
for
the
holidays
cheers
edit
just
checked
and
this
is
my
highest
rated
beer
to
date
out
of
what
i
have
reviewed
when
i
think
about
it
this
makes
perfect
sense
this
beer
is
exceptional
its
been
way
too
long
since
ive
savored
one
of
these
special
brews
from
these
smiling
monks
absolutely
exceptional
brew
here
first
rate
d
this
is
a
great
winter
brew
that
shows
classic
style
notes
and
a
sweet
winter
warmer
while
i
would
only
visit
this
brew
once
a
season
i
would
still
highly
recommend
it
this
beer
is
uncorked
with
a
resounding
pop
it
pours
a
deep
clear
rich
notquitecrimson
red
color
the
head
is
towering
firm
and
light
tan
in
hue
nice
big
malt
aromas
are
front
and
center
healthy
doses
of
alcohol
dark
fruit
and
phenols
key
to
the
smell
as
well
the
taste
is
surprisingly
smooth
with
a
serious
fullness
for
the
high
carbonation
levels
not
quite
as
dry
as
i
expected
the
taste
is
heavy
on
the
malt
and
fruit
character
all
in
all
this
is
a
fantastic
beer
d
the
beer
is
very
easy
to
drink
considering
its
strength
because
the
alcohol
is
well
hidden
worth
trying
great
winter
christmas
beer
overall
i
like
this
one
better
then
i
liked
st
bernardus
abt
12
the
dryness
really
makes
it
enjoyable
it
cuts
through
the
sweetness
to
balance
things
out
this
is
the
closest
beer
ive
had
to
westy
12
it
really
reminds
me
of
it
i
recommend
this
one
highly
drinkability
is
pretty
good
drinks
a
lot
smoother
and
lighter
than
10
and
sweetness
is
balanced
well
and
the
aged
malt
flavor
probably
helps
this
beer
was
poured
in
my
essen
christmasbeerfestivalglass
what
a
word
for
wordfeud
the
beer
was
disappointing
again
d
the
beer
has
a
very
strong
flavor
you
can
definitely
taste
and
feel
the
alcohol
however
the
beer
is
tasty
and
has
quite
a
kick
d
smooth
solid
flavours
with
a
great
appearance
the
appearance
of
this
really
sealed
the
deal
for
me
such
a
gorgeous
ale
from
a
750ml
into
a
chalice
nice
hazy
brown
carbonated
with
a
decent
head
for
ten
perecent
lacing
is
slight
the
aroma
is
fruity
like
sweet
sugary
candy
the
taste
is
just
like
the
smell
but
with
bread
pudding
taking
over
rasins
and
molasses
also
come
through
in
the
flavor
there
is
a
lot
going
on
with
this
brew
the
body
is
full
but
that
doesnt
stop
you
from
craving
more
d
at
750ml
10
its
highly
drinkable
and
smooth
a
good
one
to
share
on
a
cold
winter
night
by
the
fire
d
easy
drinker
given
the
abv
as
the
beer
warms
the
flavors
come
thru
very
enjoyable
christmas
brew
my
only
complaint
is
that
this
beer
is
a
bit
sweet
for
all
its
medicinal
flavors
the
gestalt
is
an
underattenuated
ale
with
brettanomyces
cherry
pie
flavors
if
i
hadnt
been
a
sickly
child
swilling
dimetapp
every
winter
i
am
sure
this
beer
wouldnt
conjure
the
same
images
as
it
is
a
dryer
finish
would
steer
me
into
bliss
edit
after
two
days
in
the
fridge
the
character
of
this
beer
changed
drastically
obviously
it
became
less
carbonated
and
more
sticky
but
more
dramatically
the
sourness
disappeared
completely
to
be
replaced
by
maraschino
cherries
and
a
cough
syrup
flavour
the
smell
is
different
too
cherries
christmas
cake
and
plum
pudding
d
yet
another
top
brew
by
st
bernardus
would
go
down
well
with
christmas
pudding
my
only
complaint
is
the
flavor
which
is
a
little
bit
1dimensional
compared
with
the
other
aspects
of
the
beer
nonetheless
its
still
very
good
and
would
definitely
fit
the
bill
as
a
winter
warmer
belgians
often
do
a
good
job
at
making
the
alcohol
in
these
high
abv
beers
sneakythis
one
is
no
exception
spicy
and
hot
it
is
malty
with
very
little
hop
character
aftertaste
has
a
slight
astringent
quality
this
beer
is
really
smooth
and
flavorful
it
is
an
exceptional
beer
fitting
for
a
limited
release
d
this
is
very
drinkable
it
would
probably
go
well
with
a
gamy
meat
without
spoiling
the
palate
d
i
polished
this
off
quite
easily
and
the
flavors
are
not
too
bold
and
could
allow
for
a
second
to
be
had
overall
not
impressed
d
maybe
the
best
of
all
the
belgian
christmas
beers
ive
had
to
this
point
this
is
pretty
much
what
i
think
oflook
for
in
this
kind
of
beer
man
that
monk
sure
looks
happy
and
festive
his
brew
pours
a
hazy
sienna
topped
by
a
finger
of
dirty
tan
foam
the
nose
comprises
nutmeg
fig
cinnamon
and
a
touch
of
roasted
malts
the
taste
runs
very
similarly
with
the
addition
of
banana
and
chocolate
the
body
is
a
staunch
medium
with
a
light
moderate
carbonation
and
a
somewhat
grainy
feel
overall
another
win
from
bernardus
i
cant
wait
to
try
the
others
ive
yet
to
experience
d
for
me
the
appearance
is
the
best
thing
about
this
beer
ive
never
seen
a
beer
as
opaque
a
head
as
thick
with
such
good
retention
and
carbonation
as
unrelenting
the
beer
itself
is
good
but
in
a
ivedefinitelytastedthistypeofthingbefore
kind
of
way
im
feeling
that
abv
though
warming
on
a
cold
winter
day
a
great
feeling
d
easy
to
drink
but
one
glass
sure
does
for
you
notes
feels
a
touch
short
of
the
impression
from
their
xii
but
by
the
same
token
it
may
be
more
popularly
liked
at
least
as
an
entry
point
for
festive
drinking
across
a
diverse
table
not
a
favorite
of
mine
but
with
sharing
in
mind
i
would
repeat
it
overall
i
really
enjoyed
this
beer
i
only
had
one
because
of
the
alcohol
content
and
the
sweetness
although
subtle
a
little
more
than
i
prefer
when
enjoyed
slowly
its
drinkability
is
great
given
that
the
bottle
says
you
can
age
this
for
up
to
15
years
i
need
to
buy
a
handful
of
these
now
to
save
for
the
next
christmases
like
other
holiday
season
libations
this
is
a
barely
restrained
indulgent
sipper
for
satisfying
that
sweet
tooth
keeping
out
the
chill
and
keeping
the
craziness
to
an
acceptable
hum
d
different
than
i
expected
id
been
hoping
for
abt
12
plus
spices
and
this
is
more
of
a
brown
with
spices
however
it
definitely
grew
on
me
very
drinkable
at
refrigerator
cellar
or
room
temperature
an
excellent
christmas
ale
happy
to
try
it
the
beer
pours
a
dark
brown
to
black
but
with
a
hint
of
purplish
edges
a
nice
light
fluffy
head
that
has
ok
lacing
the
smell
follows
the
taste
you
can
taste
dark
fruits
plum
currant
some
raisin
figs
some
spices
and
strong
belgian
yeast
which
is
no
surprise
you
can
definitely
feel
the
alcohol
in
the
mouth
and
the
carbonation
sharp
bite
on
the
tongue
this
beer
is
delicious
and
a
great
christmas
release
very
good
brew
to
drink
on
a
cold
night
and
get
ready
for
christmas
very
well
done
flavors
and
mouthfeel
the
added
bonus
and
what
sets
it
apart
from
the
others
i
have
tried
of
this
type
is
the
great
appearance
the
velvety
smooth
head
coats
the
tongue
as
you
drink
very
good
sipping
brew
this
isnt
my
favorite
style
of
brew
but
if
you
are
going
to
go
for
a
belgian
strong
dark
ale
this
is
maybe
your
best
option
so
far
this
one
of
my
favorite
winter
offerings
this
year
st
bernardus
rarely
disappoints
and
this
is
no
exception
mouthfeel
is
a
difficult
to
describe
combination
of
light
and
heavy
its
rather
thick
and
sticky
but
the
carbonation
makes
it
sort
of
seem
lighter
than
it
is
its
kind
of
nice
the
strong
taste
and
the
strong
alcohol
make
it
not
so
easy
to
drink
its
a
good
and
interesting
beer
though
d
i
enjoy
the
beer
but
this
was
a
tad
too
sweet
for
me
i
would
certainly
enjoy
another
but
it
is
a
sipping
beer
for
sure
d
i
had
no
problem
killing
this
one
myself
a
very
excellent
brew
drinkability
is
great
due
to
the
carbonation
it
definitely
isnt
cloying
flavors
are
interesting
and
light
dangerously
smooth
at
10
overall
what
a
beer
it
has
lots
of
complex
flavors
but
more
importantly
it
has
restraint
like
any
good
belgian
beer
it
has
elegance
at
10
percent
it
puts
some
warmth
in
your
cheeks
it
is
without
a
doubt
a
great
beer
for
the
season
popped
the
cork
and
this
exploded
with
foam
had
to
wait
15
minutes
before
i
could
pour
it
not
sure
what
happened
off
white
head
is
thick
and
creamy
body
is
clear
and
deep
brown
aroma
is
of
belgian
yeast
with
some
spice
and
dark
dried
fruit
alcohol
is
barely
noticeable
in
taste
sweet
fruity
and
malty
feel
is
moderate
and
has
the
slightest
tingle
from
carbonation
very
drinkable
but
share
it
with
a
friend
as
the
alcohol
will
seriously
sneak
up
on
you
d
a
very
nice
seasonal
holiday
beer
cant
imagine
drinking
anything
better
on
xmas
the
abv
is
well
hidden
appears
a
hazed
murky
brown
obviously
some
yeast
is
there
in
suspension
aroma
is
light
and
primarily
malty
with
some
banana
aroma
from
the
yeast
great
belgian
ale
flavors
some
dark
fruits
downplayed
spice
with
light
touches
of
allspice
and
cinnamon
some
citrus
is
also
noted
possibly
from
the
hops
brown
sugar
burnt
caramel
a
really
nice
and
well
rounded
belgian
ale
medium
to
high
level
of
carbonation
with
a
moreish
finish
i
really
liked
this
one
st
bernardus
brews
some
tasty
beers
d
very
drinkable
hides
booze
moderately
gave
me
a
nice
warmth
from
the
alcohol
but
didnt
hide
it
d
a
very
drinkable
10
beer
a
winter
sit
inside
and
enjoy
a
few
brews
beer
i
really
enjoyed
this
going
to
pick
up
a
few
bombers
next
time
i
hit
the
bottle
store
drinkability
delish
goodness
the
alcohol
of
a
10
is
there
but
with
kid
gloves
beer
is
medium
in
body
and
sweet
up
front
the
midpalate
gives
way
to
a
semidry
finish
with
some
more
sweetness
and
no
bitterness
the
beer
overall
is
highly
drinkable
and
nice
it
falls
a
little
short
in
the
middle
of
the
mouth
with
the
sweetness
on
either
side
and
dryness
at
the
end
i
like
this
beer
and
this
brewery
they
are
awesome
a
very
good
belgian
strong
dark
ale
which
doesnt
come
as
surprise
considering
the
source
this
beer
pours
a
dark
amber
with
a
huge
head
that
lasted
throughout
the
beer
has
a
sweet
smell
strong
nutmeg
smell
very
complex
taste
spicey
like
a
good
belgin
beer
sweet
nutmeg
flavors
are
also
presnte
tastes
like
a
christmas
cookie
easy
to
drink
but
should
be
enjoyed
slowley
overall
a
grea
beer
perfect
for
the
holidays
a
huge
tan
foam
head
sell
of
plum
caramel
and
figs
taste
is
a
complexed
mix
of
malts
slight
citrus
cinnamon
nutmeg
mild
carbonation
mouthfeel
is
smooth
with
a
lingering
of
malt
on
the
palate
much
like
a
desert
this
is
a
great
gift
for
a
holiday
dinner
party
this
is
a
very
good
beer
it
is
very
smooth
and
warming
the
malts
compliment
the
yeast
and
give
a
nice
inviting
drink
i
just
want
more
i
really
like
this
beer
im
glad
i
have
a
second
bottle
for
aging
pours
a
dark
caramel
with
a
nice
tan
head
and
some
good
lacing
nose
is
quite
nice
dominated
by
plums
figs
dates
nutmeg
allspice
a
touch
of
cinnamon
and
some
doughy
malt
lovely
yeast
character
taste
is
just
as
complex
and
uber
integrated
like
a
nice
holiday
dessert
without
being
at
all
overly
sweet
mouthfeel
is
nice
and
creamy
super
smooth
drinkability
is
quite
nice
will
have
to
make
this
a
tradition
d
easy
to
sip
on
and
finish
a
750ml
in
an
evening
the
alcohol
is
there
but
hidden
fairly
well
i
could
easily
drink
one
of
these
each
week
throughout
the
holiday
season
it
is
a
great
beer
a
very
nice
example
of
a
dark
belgian
ale
d
of
course
this
one
is
a
sipper
but
very
enjoyable
d
for
being
such
a
big
beer
that
is
so
complex
and
sweet
it
is
pretty
drinkable
but
not
great
this
is
definitely
a
sipper
but
on
a
cold
winter
night
this
would
probably
be
perfect
drinkability
overall
really
good
would
love
to
have
it
again
d
ok
drinkability
yeah
this
is
a
christmas
brew
but
i
would
tone
down
the
spice
on
this
a
bit
i
agree
with
a
recent
reviewer
give
me
an
abt
12
any
day
over
this
one
notes
i
noticed
many
comments
saying
that
there
is
not
much
flavor
to
the
christmas
ale
i
disagree
it
is
very
flavorful
if
a
little
onesided
in
the
raisin
and
fruity
aspects
perhaps
they
didnt
let
it
warm
a
little
too
one
sided
at
first
but
as
it
warms
things
get
better
still
ill
take
an
abt
12
for
christmas
instead
of
the
chrsitmas
beer
hows
that
for
irony
this
is
a
fairly
highly
carbonated
beverage
with
a
solidly
strong
big
bodied
mouthfeel
at
10
alcohol
this
is
extremely
drinkable
a
very
plesant
belgian
holiday
brew
that
i
would
drink
again
in
a
heartbeat
enjoyed
on
tap
at
the
tops
tasting
room
finally
got
up
to
this
pours
gorgeous
black
with
a
significnat
white
head
and
some
spices
holding
on
the
tap
lacey
this
is
a
rich
ale
mildly
malty
with
ginger
allspice
chop
white
pepper
just
had
been
tapped
last
night
a
sipper
honestly
this
was
a
bit
of
a
letdown
maybe
id
set
my
hopes
too
high
having
been
waiting
for
a
good
time
to
enjoy
this
bottle
that
id
had
since
xmas
but
that
surely
isnt
all
i
would
have
expected
a
bit
more
flavor
and
aroma
it
didnt
really
feel
like
a
belgian
christmas
ale
and
for
a
beer
of
this
style
it
wasnt
particularly
impressive
finish
is
long
with
lingering
holiday
spice
this
one
has
a
serious
toastiness
to
it
while
still
being
sweetly
caramelly
theres
a
nice
cinnamony
bite
with
the
spices
characteristic
of
a
christmas
ale
theres
a
little
sweet
honey
slick
feel
slight
bite
of
the
alcohol
dried
cherry
taste
in
the
background
decent
mouthfeel
slightly
creamy
and
filling
overall
excellent
winter
warmer
would
like
to
try
one
fresh
to
see
what
the
spice
level
is
and
how
muted
the
perfumy
alcohol
notes
are
as
opposed
to
this
older
bottle
have
a
feeling
a
bottle
of
this
fabulous
winter
brew
would
hold
up
for
quite
some
time
well
worth
a
try
especially
this
time
of
year
taste
is
lightly
roasted
with
a
candisugary
sweetness
a
light
bitterness
which
is
a
combination
of
hop
and
malt
bitterness
the
yeast
adds
a
nice
fruity
belgian
taste
at
the
cloverleaf
tavern
caldwell
nj
poured
mahogany
with
one
finger
of
khaki
head
with
good
lacing
smelled
of
candied
fruit
cloves
and
blood
orange
very
unique
tasted
of
orange
clove
allspice
and
candi
sugar
very
similar
to
the
nose
however
the
alcohol
burn
was
certainly
evident
in
the
finish
very
malty
velvety
mouthfeel
probably
the
best
aspect
of
this
beer
good
sipping
beer
a
really
nice
beer
very
slick
without
being
cloying
with
great
flavors
just
very
well
put
together
an
excellent
christmas
ale
which
was
one
of
the
best
ive
ever
had
it
went
down
easy
on
its
own
as
well
as
complimenting
the
meal
i
had
it
with
a
great
beer
great
brew
although
the
flavor
and
mouthfeel
dont
live
up
to
the
incredible
aroma
not
to
mention
other
st
bernardus
brews
such
as
the
abt
12
still
a
great
beer
to
enjoy
on
christmas
eve
wow
awesome
beer
one
of
the
best
seasonals
ive
had
this
winter
d
overall
a
great
representation
of
the
style
reviewed
from
notes
that
i
took
a
few
nights
ago
pours
a
hazy
dark
copperbrown
color
with
a
gigantic
creamy
head
that
would
not
go
away
the
head
is
so
creamy
that
i
could
almost
skim
it
off
and
eat
it
medium
lacing
is
left
on
my
glass
smell
is
huge
fruit
and
spices
there
are
yeastybreadlike
notes
and
a
tiny
bit
of
alcohol
i
get
cloves
coriander
and
pine
in
the
nose
as
well
the
smell
is
a
bit
too
spicy
to
me
the
taste
is
also
very
fruity
dark
fruits
like
raisins
attack
the
mouth
nutmeg
coriander
and
cloves
also
assault
the
palette
there
is
also
a
huge
yeast
taste
but
no
alcohol
impressive
for
10abv
the
taste
is
a
little
over
the
top
for
me
in
fruits
and
spices
the
mouthfeel
is
a
bit
watery
to
me
not
what
i
expected
from
the
huge
creamy
head
lighter
body
than
i
would
want
for
a
pretty
big
beer
a
huge
coat
of
spicy
fruit
is
left
on
a
warm
tongue
as
far
as
db
drinking
a
lot
of
this
would
be
tough
i
am
very
happy
that
i
halved
the
bottle
because
the
spices
become
extremely
powerful
after
even
one
pint
the
alcohol
also
starts
to
get
pretty
hot
as
it
warms
up
love
it
awesome
christmas
brew
much
enjoyed
thine
is
the
kingdom
and
the
power
pours
a
dark
copperamber
with
a
monstrous
head
that
does
not
quit
must
wait
35
minutes
for
it
to
die
down
and
pour
the
rest
of
the
beer
smell
is
caramel
raisins
dark
fruits
sweet
and
toasty
taste
is
big
and
sweet
lots
of
fruits
and
some
burnt
toast
caramel
as
well
mouthfeel
is
good
creamy
could
be
a
tiny
bit
heavier
lots
of
fruity
sweetness
the
alcohol
is
well
masked
but
it
warms
nicely
good
brew
lots
to
take
in
d
oh
yeah
still
decently
drinkable
especially
for
the
abv
a
bit
of
a
slow
drink
but
its
worth
savoring
i
could
get
used
to
drinking
this
but
i
dont
think
my
waste
band
could
the
drinkability
is
a
solid
4
the
abv
is
very
well
masked
theres
no
trace
other
than
the
slight
warming
in
the
throat
it
would
be
even
better
with
body
and
carbonation
adjusted
a
bit
overall
while
not
without
its
flaws
its
a
very
good
winter
beer
that
hits
most
of
the
right
notes
pours
brown
with
a
beige
head
lots
of
extremely
small
fine
bubbles
the
aroma
is
belgian
yeast
as
well
as
dark
fruits
and
candi
sugar
the
taste
pretty
much
follows
the
aroma
with
lots
of
caramel
malt
the
overall
flavor
is
pretty
sweet
and
the
alcohol
is
present
and
warming
medium
mouthfeel
and
highly
carbonated
the
witbier
and
quad
offered
by
st
bernardus
are
at
the
apex
of
their
respective
styles
and
their
christmas
offering
is
no
slouch
either
even
if
i
have
had
a
few
winter
brews
ive
enjoyed
more
no
surprise
that
those
behind
st
bernardus
monks
or
otherwise
would
turn
out
an
excellent
christmas
ale
their
regular
line
which
is
anything
but
regular
consists
of
some
of
the
greatest
beers
in
the
world
and
this
one
is
no
exception
d
a
superb
drinker
the
cool
thing
is
the
label
says
it
can
be
cellared
for
up
to
15
years
cool
they
make
nothing
but
excellent
beer
after
excellent
beer
this
is
a
great
sipping
beer
fairly
complex
and
flavorful
with
a
satisfying
warming
feel
about
it
d
this
is
an
excelent
christmas
beer
with
an
excelent
taste
definitly
worth
trying
red
crimson
beer
with
an
offwhite
foamy
head
the
nose
smelled
like
a
christmas
fruitcake
lots
of
nuts
toffee
mild
chocolate
and
raisins
the
taste
was
there
mouthfeel
was
not
a
slow
sipper
for
sure
dark
brown
bread
sweet
almost
cloying
from
the
malts
dark
candi
sugar
and
spice
cake
in
the
taste
mouthfeel
was
not
alive
not
sharp
either
but
dull
slightly
dry
and
semiflat
tasting
definitely
a
complex
beer
just
not
impressed
with
much
else
full
bodied
with
a
smooth
mouthfeel
overall
this
one
plays
out
very
much
like
the
abt
12
but
with
a
more
noticeable
spice
presence
very
enjoyable
and
a
great
christmas
treat
drinkable
but
over
the
top
sweet
i
guess
thats
what
people
want
for
the
holidays
lots
of
small
bubbles
of
carbonation
that
turn
out
prickly
and
somewhat
unpleasant
mediumfull
bodied
somewhat
firm
very
tasty
but
unfortunately
not
a
beer
style
that
i
seem
to
like
nice
holiday
ale
a
bit
sweet
overall
but
well
spiced
alcohol
is
high
but
the
flavors
carry
it
well
overall
i
love
this
beer
it
reminds
me
of
the
abt
12
but
not
quite
as
luxurious
i
am
glad
i
purchased
it
and
may
even
purchase
it
again
next
year
i
highly
recommend
it
it
made
my
christmas
even
better
than
it
already
was
this
beer
tasted
unfortunately
close
to
cola
the
horribly
overdone
carbonation
doesnt
help
matters
very
disappointing
offering
from
such
an
outstanding
brewery
d
a
good
slightly
different
twist
on
an
exceptional
beer
overall
pretty
enjoyable
my
first
st
bernardus
beer
pretty
stoked
cork
pops
off
with
a
big
explosion
hitting
the
ceiling
followed
by
a
little
bit
of
foaming
spillage
its
a
christmas
miracle
pours
very
dark
looks
black
until
held
up
to
the
light
which
makes
it
blood
red
with
lots
of
sediment
floating
about
big
fluffy
pillow
of
offwhite
head
rests
on
top
leaves
good
lacing
smell
is
big
on
belgian
yeast
fruit
and
a
bit
of
booze
taste
is
excellent
with
lots
of
flavors
bursting
through
im
tasting
lots
of
fruit
mostly
dark
ones
such
as
cherries
plums
and
raisins
also
a
hint
of
banana
lots
of
belgian
yeastbiscuit
taste
winter
spice
and
molasses
as
well
alcohol
extremely
wellhidden
the
entire
time
very
tasty
and
complex
i
will
definitely
buy
this
next
year
drinkability
a
definite
sipper
both
due
to
the
carbonation
and
the
high
alcohol
an
enjoyable
beer
too
although
i
was
a
little
disappointed
that
there
wasnt
more
of
a
special
or
holiday
feel
to
this
beer
it
tasted
almost
generic
and
there
wasnt
something
that
made
it
stand
out
i
would
certainly
have
it
again
but
its
not
one
i
would
spend
hours
searching
for
i
wouldnt
mind
having
one
of
these
on
hand
to
age
though
this
is
a
very
tasty
holiday
treat
that
i
can
easily
look
forward
to
every
year
it
is
a
slow
drinking
beer
but
savoring
its
complex
flavors
is
no
problem
every
belgian
beer
i
try
just
leads
me
want
to
try
another
this
is
the
first
time
i
have
ever
tried
this
bought
another
earlier
in
this
season
to
age
for
next
year
now
i
am
interested
in
cracking
it
open
to
see
how
it
compares
to
the
aged
version
for
some
reason
these
go
on
deep
discount
after
santa
arrives
heading
to
the
beer
store
tomorrow
to
see
what
is
left
drinkability
great
holiday
belgian
but
i
prefer
a
few
others
to
this
surprising
i
finished
in
a
single
sitting
medium
body
that
hides
the
10
d
this
is
a
easy
one
to
drink
quick
i
could
do
a
whole
bottle
easily
and
in
fact
i
will
because
the
way
my
lifes
been
going
recently
i
need
to
be
drunk
more
the
10
helps
im
thinking
bsda
with
a
winter
warmer
twist
this
could
be
my
favorite
offering
from
bernardus
either
this
or
the
12
may
have
to
compare
very
good
beer
not
my
favorite
holiday
beer
but
still
quite
nice
and
enjoyable
sint
bernardus
is
one
of
my
favorite
breweries
for
its
pater
6
prior
8
and
abott
12
line
however
those
beers
are
legacy
of
tight
cooperation
between
the
brewery
and
local
monastery
and
could
be
classified
as
descendants
of
westvleteren
unfortunately
the
rest
of
bernardus
offerings
does
not
meet
the
high
standards
set
by
the
pious
brothers
68
and
12
recommended
music
pairing
ray
charles
the
spirit
of
christmas
im
not
sure
what
makes
this
a
christmas
beer
but
its
really
good
regardless
what
a
xmas
treat
this
beer
is
with
a
nose
that
never
stops
developing
and
a
huge
head
flecked
with
brown
spots
from
the
sediment
i
got
a
huge
rounded
mouthfeel
with
lots
of
dark
candy
fruits
and
typical
belgian
yeast
no
spices
in
this
xmas
ale
but
rather
the
suggestion
of
xmas
pudding
i
really
savoured
this
beer
with
every
sip
as
it
was
part
of
a
trade
and
not
available
in
bc
pours
a
deep
ruby
red
with
a
deliciuos
fluffy
mocha
colored
head
has
the
sweet
maltyfunky
aroma
of
a
good
abbey
ale
the
first
sip
is
yummy
malty
smooth
and
creamy
with
ahint
of
cinnamon
at
the
end
each
sip
is
even
better
than
the
first
more
malty
smoothnes
with
hints
of
dried
fruits
and
nutmeg
a
great
ale
for
christmas
i
will
be
looking
for
this
one
every
december
it
is
a
shame
this
was
the
last
one
in
my
store
otherwise
i
would
buy
another
drinkability
relatively
so
definitely
a
sipper
near
the
end
as
it
warms
up
more
you
can
taste
the
alcohol
a
bit
more
than
at
the
beginning
overall
a
very
good
fireplace
sipper
overall
this
beer
is
becoming
one
of
my
favorite
christmas
ales
and
it
is
another
well
crafted
ale
from
the
brewers
of
st
bernardus
recommended
im
not
sure
if
the
two
years
of
age
helped
this
out
but
this
beer
is
in
that
small
group
that
defines
belgian
greatness
classy
stuff
served
to
me
in
a
belgian
style
glass
appearance
was
dark
with
a
huge
amount
of
head
which
laced
extremely
well
the
nose
hasd
hints
of
cherry
and
a
prominent
alcohol
aroma
not
in
a
bad
way
just
bold
taste
was
a
wonderful
blend
of
sweetness
warmth
from
the
alcohol
and
complex
fruitiness
and
spice
the
high
carbonation
of
this
beer
really
gives
it
it
huge
mouthfeel
given
the
higher
gravity
of
this
beer
im
impressed
with
the
smooth
finish
which
makes
this
beer
highly
drinkable
overall
one
of
the
better
christmas
beers
ive
had
all
year
this
poured
a
nearly
opaque
dark
mahogany
with
tons
of
fluffy
tan
head
it
smelled
like
spicy
and
sour
belgian
yeast
with
rich
caramel
nutmeg
candi
sugar
fresh
wheat
and
a
bit
of
alcohol
it
tasted
like
wild
creamy
yeast
and
spicy
malt
with
some
sweet
candi
sugar
and
caramel
and
a
bit
of
raisin
and
fig
and
alcohol
it
was
slightly
thick
with
moderate
carbonation
and
had
a
bittersweet
and
sour
aftertaste
overall
this
had
a
great
dark
belgian
scent
and
taste
with
a
bit
of
a
spicy
twist
for
the
holidays
it
had
good
body
too
but
the
alcohol
was
fairly
hot
so
a
fresh
bottle
wasnt
entirely
easy
to
drink
it
was
still
enjoyable
to
sip
but
it
didnt
blow
me
away
like
abt
12
first
did
regardless
with
some
age
this
would
be
amazing
d
too
easy
finished
the
bottle
and
didnt
feel
it
till
much
later
im
slowly
going
off
these
belgian
strong
darks
as
the
sweetness
doesnt
appeal
to
me
as
much
as
it
used
to
that
said
i
do
think
this
is
a
nice
example
of
the
style
and
would
be
a
definite
reccomendation
for
lovers
of
good
belgian
beer
d
this
should
be
had
all
year
not
just
at
christmas
great
belgian
dark
great
flavor
and
mouthfeel
the
only
downside
to
the
drinkability
is
the
higher
abv
and
i
wouldnt
even
consider
that
a
downside
overall
another
great
beer
from
st
bernardus
d
really
an
exceptional
beer
and
easily
the
best
christmas
ale
i
have
had
to
date
dangerously
drinkable
despite
the
big
abv
go
and
buy
another
bottle
of
this
beer
idiot
flash
of
toasted
malt
up
front
estery
fruit
follows
and
is
quickly
joined
by
a
huge
swell
of
sweet
fruity
caramely
malts
sweet
concord
grapes
blend
with
sugarcoated
raisins
perfectly
ripe
bartlett
pears
brown
sugar
and
caramel
sweet
cake
batter
toasted
nuts
and
even
a
little
cocoa
lead
into
the
finish
lingering
rummy
fruits
swell
once
again
in
the
finish
theres
also
some
yeastiness
and
a
cocoa
nib
and
herbal
hop
bitterness
warming
fullbodied
with
a
thick
gently
carbonated
feel
very
nice
especially
on
this
10
degree
f
night
this
beer
has
plenty
of
legs
and
tastes
good
it
starts
off
velvety
with
a
slight
bit
of
spice
and
caramel
it
then
goes
into
raisons
toffee
and
some
winter
spices
being
10
i
would
not
sit
down
and
drink
more
than
one
or
two
but
this
is
a
beer
for
the
winter
months
as
far
as
christmas
beers
goes
this
is
not
quite
as
good
as
a
corsendonk
christmas
but
it
does
rank
high
within
this
category
of
beers
merry
christmas
poured
from
a
corked
750ml
bottle
in
a

quite
delicious

like
melting
caramel
and
tastes
very
malty

think
i
detect

coriander

brew
with

without
going

on
any

ingrediant
d
i
like
more
plum
and
bready
flavors
in
my
quads
and
theyre
totally
absent
in
this
one
drain

kickbacks
in

poured
into

chalice
small
offwhite

sinks

aroma

mainly
of
sweet

taste
is
sweet
slightly
warming
and
includes
all
of
the
aforementioned
fruits
and
some
peppery
spice
abv
is
wonderfully
hidden
behind
the
loads
of
flavors
in
this
beer
a
truly
special
and
delicious
treat
paired
well
with

rich

of

and
said

medium

almost
smells
and
tastes
like
it
needs
more
body
smooth
low
tannins
very
easy
on
the
finish
good
brew
but
expect
more
from
this
brewery
and
at
this
price
note
from
a
bottle
this
beer
needs
to
release
some
carbonation
to
really
shine
pop
it
cold
and
let
it
outgas
and
warm
before
serving
malt
structure
is
welcomingly
light
for
the
abv
yet
offers
good
depth
drinkability
this
is
really
a
nice
beer
for
sipping
and
in
many
ways
is
a
showcase
for
the
spices
and
the
subtle
effects
of
the
noble
hops
ill
be
looking
out
for
this
in
the
future
as
a
seasonal
treat
this
is
a
nice
one
to
have
and
to
serve
if
it
were
not
for
the
abv
id
have
another
immediately
this
one
is
gone
based
on
my
experience
with
st
bernadus
abt
12
i
was
expecting
a
more
malt
dominant
brew
as
a
christmas
seasonal
however
while
this
beer
has
malt
present
there
is
a
very
different
balance
between
malt
and
hops
than
in
the
12
here
the
spiciness
is
never
lost
in
the
malt
at
first
i
was
not
sure
i
liked
this
beer
but
as
i
have
sipped
my
way
slowly
through
it
i
find
a
growing
appreciation
for
the
balance
of
flavors
in
addition
this
one
has
shown
some
very
nice
and
interesting
changes
in
flavors
as
it
warmed
to
room
temperature
poured
into
a
goblet
for
a
well
carbonated
brown
body
with
lasting
tan
head
and
bubbly
lace
a
great
yeasty
smell
along
with
some
sweet
caramel
malt
and
minor
citric
hop
bitterness
along
with
orange
real
smooth
a
little
creamy
mediumbodied
with
a
little
bit
of
oakiness
along
with
minor
pepper
and
spices
hints
of
vanilla
and
chocolate
along
with
caramel
give
it
a
balanced
sweetness
and
there
is
a
good
fruit
base
with
orange
and
pear
and
a
little
citric
notes
has
a
dry
yet
clean
finish
and
the
abv
is
well
hidden
a
very
enjoyable
ale
to
relax
with
and
sip
on
summary
extremely
drinkable
beer
and
thus
far
my
favorite
winter
warmer
to
will
for
sure
be
drinking
this
one
again
that
being
said
its
not
all
that
impressive
to
be
honest
d
fairly
high
good
beer
overall
not
bad
for
a
xmas
release
but
i
still
would
take
the
12
over
this
one
carbonation
is
just
about
perfect
for
this
fullbodied
brew
it
has
a
pleasant
mouthfeel
overall
much
more
smooth
of
a
drink
than
i
expected
from
its
sharp
smell
cheers
overall
a
wonderful
brew
worth
seeking
out
a
must
try
i
dunno
belgians
brewers
just
do
what
they
want
eff
the
style
and
i
respect
that
extreme
beer
in
the
usa
strange
and
yummy
quaint
step
out
of
the
ordinary
amber
brown
with
a
thin
light
tan
head
and
a
scant
malty
aroma
full
mouth
light
chocolate
start
progressing
to
caramel
with
some
spice
sweet
but
not
too
overly
so
id
like
to
try
this
one
after
laying
it
down
for
3
or
4
years
hopefully
will
become
more
complex
the
mouthfeel
is
heavy
and
consistent
with
the
style
drinkability
is
excellent
for
such
a
strong
beer
but
after
a
couple
you
really
start
to
feel
it
i
taste
a
lot
of
dark
fruit
flavors
and
high
lov
crystal
malts
the
raisin
malty
sweetness
tastes
fantastic
i
dont
really
know
what
i
expected
but
it
was
really
a
treat
ill
grab
another
one
if
i
find
it
again
it
was
poured
ontap
into
a
chimay
goblet
with
the
silver
edge
looked
a
nice
dark
brownblack
with
very
little
head
likely
due
to
the
pour
it
smelled
terrific
dark
and
spicy
with
a
fruitiness
as
well
the
taste
was
also
quite
good
but
i
expected
a
little
more
from
the
smell
mouthfeel
was
merely
ok
perhaps
slightly
more
carbonated
than
i
would
have
expected
drinkability
was
good
i
would
have
drank
several
more
of
these
on
tap
at
kinsale
as
part
of
their
xmas
in
july
weekend
served
in
a
tulip
style
glass
dark
orange
reddish
color
no
real
head
and
doesnt
look
very
carbonated
smelled
a
lot
like
cinnamon
and
orange
peel
has
a
definite
dubbel
taste
to
it
lots
of
ripe
fruit
and
jam
the
only
thing
that
surprised
me
was
the
mouthfeel
i
found
this
beer
very
thin
and
watery
i
expected
a
bit
more
from
such
a
well
know
belgian
brewer
it
was
a
nice
beer
on
a
cool
evening
but
not
one
of
my
favorite
christmas
beers
ive
ever
had
not
hearty
enough
for
a
winter
themed
beer
d
not
the
best
day
for
drinking
summer
night
in
calgary
would
have
been
better
as
a
winter
warmer
duh
d
very
drinkable
savor
this
beer
on
a
good
cold
night
it
will
keep
you
warm
i
could
easily
see
drinking
2
of
these
puppies
and
still
wanting
more
a
classic
example
of
a
good
christmas
ale
very
well
done
too
bad
it
is
july
and
i
am
in
sydney
australia
damn
first
lost
abbey
angels
share
brandy
last
night
750
corked
flat
tonight
this
one
completely
flat
too
both
have
great
taste
but
without
carbonation
its
like
saltines
without
the
salt
i
am
not
going
to
even
bother
drinking
it
need
a
food
recipe
to
use
it
bottle
poured
a
deep
burgundy
color
ale
with
a
super
large
foamy
head
with
great
retention
and
good
lacing
aroma
of
dry
fruit
and
fruity
ester
with
some
candi
sugar
and
some
nicer
belgian
malt
taste
is
a
well
balanced
mix
between
some
fruity
ester
some
dry
fruits
such
as
figs
and
notes
of
belgian
malt
body
is
full
with
great
carbonation
and
no
appearance
of
alcohol
very
well
done
though
it
probably
fell
short
of
the
abt
12
caramelcopper
body
with
a
frothy
head
sweet
raisins
spiced
stone
fruits
and
a
little
funk
the
palate
is
sweet
caramelized

raisins
figs
spice
earthy
yeast
alcohol
and
a
bitter
finish
the
body
is
medium
and
finish
dry
good
brew
from
one
of
the
top
belgian
brewers
like
abt
12
but
maybe
a
touch
more
sweetness
dark
amber
in
color
with
reddish
tint
thick
frothy
head
and
a
little
bit
volatile
sweet
malty
nose
with
fruity
and
floral
hints
fruity
malt
attack
with
a
sweetness
like
licorice
very
malty
the
malt
is
so
strong
that
it
presents
as
a
sweet
beer
even
though
it
is
isnt
sweet
in
a
sugar
sense
the
body
is
sufficient
to
carry
the
10
percent
alcohol
which
is
impressive
by
itself
clean
finish
with
lingering
malty
aftertaste
some
spicy
notes
and
an
effervescent
type
of
feel
to
it
as
it
breathed
the
carbonation
settled
down
a
little
and
made
for
a
very
nice
treat
just
lovely
balanced
flavors
no
hint
of
the
lurking
10
this
was
a
very
enjoyable
beer
and
im
anxious
to
see
was
2
years
on
one
of
these
would
do
poured
a
cloudy
dark
amber
color
with
a
dirty
white
head
and
good
carbonation
nose
is
malt
yeast
driedf
fruits
spiciness
and
candy
taste
was
of
malt
caramel
and
candy
with
the
added
spice
finish
was
nice
not
as
boozy
as
the
10
abv
leads
you
to
believe
good
brew
overall
drinkability
wish
i
had
more
of
this
the
little
4oz
sampler
wasnt
enough
really
tasty
but
i
could
see
this
one
being
very
hard
to
finish
on
ones
own
the
carbonation
spice
and
body
may
get
to
ya
d
this
is
definitely
a
slow
drinker
here
perfect
for
the
cold
holiday
season
drinkability
this
one
goes
down
quickly
despite
the
high
alcohol
levels
a
few
of
these
could
be
consumed
in
a
session
but
you
will
be
feeling
it
quickly
d
very
drinkable
for
a
couple
of
bears
but
the
spicy
flavors
would
wear
on
your
after
a
few
tasty
beer
very
rich
good
after
dinner
sipper
drinkability
a
pretty
awesome
beer
st
bernardus
or
not
a
lot
to
admire
which
i
wasnt
surprised
about
its
fairly
expensive
but
certainly
worth
it
especially
for
a
beyondgreat
holiday
brew
to
share
with
friends
and
family
i
cant
think
of
a
better
one
to
drink
at
christmas
really
at
this
point
and
i
cant
believe
its
taken
me
this
long
to
get
to
it
a
bit
too
sweet
to
drink
a
whole
lot
of
but
very
rich
and
complex
definitely
a
solid
and
genuine
belgian
strong
this
is
a
very
very
good
example
of
a
belgian
beer
and
if
you
have
any
remote
interest
in
the
style
then
youll
love
this
one
not
my
favorite
st
b
but
good
on
a
cold
night
with
the
fire
going
this
ale
was
worth
the
price
and
is
worthy
of
being
opened
any
time
of
year
despite
its
name
its
not
as
multidimensional
and
smooth
as
many
st
bernardus
offerings
but
it
says
happy
holidays
in
a
bold
auspicious
manner
in
fact
its
the
almost
obnoxiously
prevalent
abv
searing
and
blearing
that
holds
things
back
a
bit
and
yet
despite
the
intimidation
factor
im
happier
at
the
end
of
the
bottle
than
at
the
beginning
and
thats
in
a
good
way
taste
again
light
malt
with
a
bit
of
date
a
hint
of
some
medicinal
herbs
and
has
an
ethanolic
finish
it
tastes
like
the
nose
with
a
bit
hit
of
not
overdone
sweetness
at
the
end
very
complex
spicy
with
intriguing
aftertaste
this
brew
pours
up
a
red
tinted
brown
color
with
a
nice
frothy
off
white
head
great
lacing
the
nose
is
red
apple
faint
candy
sugar
sweet
malts
caramel
pear
the
taste
is
very
sweet
dark
cherries
yeast
chewy
malts
medium
bodied
and
medium
carbo
i
like
belgium
holiday
ales
because
they
generally
dont
have
a
set
taste
and
they
are
all
different
a
solid
beer
the
body
is
closer
to
moderate
but
a
bit
much
for
a
belgium
holiday
beer
some
heat
from
the
alcohol
overall
good
but
very
muddled
together
would
have
liked
to
see
the
spice
back
off
and
more
belgian
characteristics
come
out
pours
a
huge
active
frothy
tannish
colored
head
with
big
bubbles
body
is
a
dark
brown
color
cant
see
through
at
all
very
floral
sweet
smelling
nose
dark
fruit
like
plum
or
grape
some
spiciness
too
and
a
little
bit
of
alcohol
not
an
overpowering
aroma
sweet
spicy
effervescent
aftertaste
not
too
drying
thirstquenching
a
fruity
taste
somewhat
dark
but
some
light
fruit
present
too
like
pear
and
banana
nice
winter
spices
carbonated
palate
somewhat
creamy
not
too
bad
tasty
for
a
spiced
brew
even
tastier
as
it
warms
mmmm
not
quite
what
i
was
expecting
from
a
holiday
grr
christmas
ale
but
thanks
to
christophers
in
cambridge
st
bernardus
i
can
expand
my
expectations
of
such
it
was
lovely
to
find
this
gem
on
draught
served
proper
glassware
all
served
up
dark
mysterious
with
a
thin
lacey
head
that
soon
disappeared
a
grapemalt
lavender
aroma
pervaded
but
not
tacky
or
overwhelmingly
so
the
color
showed
in
the
light
as
a
dark
purplebrown
and
an
intial
alchol
nose
upon
sipping
soon
opened
to
a
chewy
dunkelweiss
with
grape
hints
in
a
belgian
lambic
style
quite
a
lovely
sipping
savoring
ale
quite
potent
d
wont
buy
this
one
again
but
was
fun
to
try
nonetheless
if
friends
have
it
id
give
it
another
go
but
i
was
underwhelmed
this
time
d
at
first
i
didnt
really
get
this
beer
it
seemed
to
be
a
high
alcohol
belgian
w
lots
of
banana
but
after
reviewing
it
i
began
to
enjoy
the
complexity
of
the
taste
and
mouthfeel
more
while
i
wouldnt
rate
it
as
my
favorite
holiday
beer
it
is
certainly
good
and
probably
were
i
in
a
colder
climate
during
january
i
would
like
it
even
more
i
bet
its
great
in
front
a
fire
as
the
label
advertises
d
full
drinks
make
the
most
of
this
one
but
10
abv
dictates
some
time
in
between
good
brew
overall
one
of
if
not
thee
best
beer
ive
had
that
has
called
itself
a
christmas
beer
or
ale
cant
wait
till
next
year
d
10
abv
is
not
for
the
faint
of
heart
but
the
huge
and
delicious
flavors
do
a
pretty
good
job
of
hiding
it
to
a
point
d
wow
for
a
strong
belgian
ale
it
just
does
not
get
any
more
drinkable
than
this
very
good
with
the
alcohol
well
hidden
this
is
a
fantastic
beer
tons
of
deep
flavors
almost
too
easy
to
drink
begging
you
to
take
another
sip
and
the
high
abv
does
not
overwhelm
amongst
the
various
flavors
d
this
is
a
sipper
quite
sweet
so
limiting
to
one
would
probably
be
wise
drinkability
without
the
metallic
note
its
very
good
not
quite
up
to
their
flagship
but
could
be
almost
as
good
with
the
note
its
slightly
annoying
and
better
than
average
this
was
less
than
expected
for
the
brewery
i
tend
to
prefer
the
nonspiced
winter
beers
but
this
one
well
doesnt
really
do
it
for
me
nice
but
expected
better
from
this
brewery
pours
a
dark
brown
in
color
with
no
clarity
head
is
an
off
whitebrown
and
thick
aroma
is
some
malts
fruit
and
slight
hops
very
sweet
sweet
taste
with
some
malts
and
hops
lots
of
spice
and
very
fruity
excellent
texture
and
body
but
not
heavy
an
excellent
session
beer
especially
around
the
holidays
it
really
doesnt
get
much
better
than
this
id
been
looking
forward
to
the
bottle
for
a
long
time
and
it
does
not
dissapoint
d
i
had
been
saving
this
one
for
a
few
weeks
to
cap
off
christmas
night
very
drinkable
and
a
great
offering
for
the
holiday
season
complex
and
first
rate
beer
this
is
one
good
beer
why
oh
why
deer
lord
would
this
only
be
available
at
christmas
i
guess
that
answers
its
own
question
the
lord
is
no
fool
beautiful
mud
pour
nice
head
aroma
of
wine
taste
is
sweet
then
sour
and
then
just
good
heavy
alcohol
makes
it
a
bit
tough
to
drink
when
driving
otherwise
down
it
goes
ive
always
been
a
big
fan
of
st
bernardus
so
i
was
expecting
a
great
beer
and
it
delivered
one
of
the
best
holiday
beers
ive
had
recently
highly
recommended
st
bernardus
christmas
ale
manages
to
capture
the
spirit
of
the
season
with
a
spiciness
whose
origins
are
a
mystery
it
probably
wont
be
everyones
cup
of
ale
but
im
having
a
great
time
sipping
and
savoring
what
a
wonderful
beer
to
cap
off
christmas
2008
in
style
recommended
an
ok
beer
ive
had
better
belgians
brouwerij
st
bernardus
is
one
of
those
special
breweries
that
really
cant
make
a
bad
beer
i
was
on
the
fence
a
little
with
this
one
as
far
as
flavor
goes
at
the
end
of
the
day
it
grew
on
me
enough
to
warrant
a
4
5
score
for
taste
it
is
that
good
the
nose
could
be
a
little
better
but
this
is
a
damn
fine
beer
all
the
same
it
certainly
warrants
an
annual
purchase
definitely
recommended
i
might
go
buy
another
bottle
to
let
age
in
the
cellar
to
find
out
how
well
this
ages
for
next
year
this
was
tasty
but
a
bit
too
sweet
for
me
to
have
too
much
of
pours
a
murky
chestnut
brown
slight
reddish
highlights
when
held
to
light
and
an
absolutely
gigantic
foamy
beige
head
settles
extremely
slowly
and
leaves
big
clumps
of
lacing
on
the
glass
lots
of
spicy
dark
fruits
on
the
nose
raisin
plum
fig
and
big
belgian
yeast
aromas
taste
follows
right
along
some
bellywarming
alcohol
slightly
earthy
character
to
the
beer
as
well
really
im
having
a
hard
time
imagining
anything
more
enjoyable
to
sip
on
during
a
freezing
snowy
night
with
the
holidays
right
around
the
corner
absolutely
delicious
overall
a
great
beer
great
stuff
i
need
to
get
some
more
d
this
is
a
solid
effort
from
st
bernardus
a
brewery
that
seems
incapable
of
making
a
bad
beer
d
real
good
despite
thinness
but
the
nose
and
taste
this
a
great
beer
expect
to
get
a
little
warm
and
twisted
off
winter
sessions
due
to
higher
abvbut
i
had
four
glasses
in
a
four
hour
span
and
certainly
could
have
had
more
this
comes
out
of
the
tap
an
opaque
dark
brown
with
a
thick
pale
tan
head
aroma
is
very
hoppy
and
spicy
inviting
a
taste
flavor
does
not
disappoint
it
is
mainly
hoppy
with
spicy
overtones
and
a
spicy
evergreen
aftertaste
texture
is
very
smooth
and
cooling
an
excellent
winter
brew
d
all
winter
long
enjoy
this
slowly
and
relish
creamy
with
a
mild
sweetness
and
the
archetypical
belgian
flavor
from
the
yeast
alcohol
is
potent
and
adds
to
the
rich
body
the
swallow
has
a
faint
touch
of
hop
but
its
a
predominantly
sour
malt
flavor
the
aftertaste
is
brief
overall
i
am
not
a
huge
fan
of
the
christmas
styles
but
this
one
is
a
one
of
a
kind
not
to
be
missed
outstanding
beer
ontap
at
the
farmhouse
in
emmaus
pa
overall
this
is
a
pretty
good
belgian
but
its
not
as
complex
at
the
abt
12
it
actually
reminds
me
of
chimay
blue
more
than
bernardus
12
the
flavor
comes
off
like
a
cinnamon
spice
caramel
apple
with
toasted
toffee
and
sweet
bread
delicious
but
it
doesnt
reach
the
depths
of
a
great
strong
dark
ale
still
very
easy
to
drink
worth
a
try
wonderful
drinkability
here
too
bad
this
only
comes
out
once
a
year
nicely
carbonated
the
mouth
feel
is
complimented
by
the
creaminess
of
the
head
and
the
figgy
flavors
full
flavored
this
is
textbook
to
style
the
belgian
malty
fruit
thing
is
center
stage
the
mouth
feel
is
creamy
and
much
heavier
than
your
everyday
abbey
ale
the
10
abv
is
well
integrated
i
personally
highly
recommend
this
one
as
part
of
your
holiday
festivities
another
high
quality
product
from
brouwerij
st
bernardus
nv
this
is
a
jovial
holiday
concoction
its
more
or
less
like
a
fruitier
spiced
12
d
very
good
but
spicier
and
sweeter
than
other
st
bernardus
offerings
making
it
just
slightly
less
drinkable
pours
a
murky
amber
to
brownish
color
with
a
big
light
tan
head
in
the
aroma
candy
sugar
small
roastiness
cinnamon
and
nutmeg
in
the
taste
cinnamon
a
dry
sugary
feel
and
small
hints
of
plum
as
sugar
plums
danced
in
my
head
sorry
a
small
spicey
bite
and
medium
bodied
mouthfeel
with
a
dry
cinnamon
spice
aftertaste
quite
smooth
and
not
overbarring
nice
spices
all
around
pretty
good
this
is
a
great
winter
brew
highly
recommended
and
something
i
will
have
more
of
75cl
bottle
from
the
lighthouse
in
manchester
maine
pours
a
hazy
but
still
translucent
dark
copper
with
a
half
inch
of
light
tan
head
smells
intensely
fruity
and
spicy
with
banana
nut
and
chocolate
notes
tastes
fruity
chocolatey
and
spicy
with
an
underlying
toastiness
banana
nut
cherry
dates
and
cloves
all
play
nearly
equal
roles
on
the
heavier
side
of
mediumbodied
with
ample
carbonation
more
of
a
sipper
though
one
sip
most
definitely
invites
another
and
this
beer
was
gone
long
before
i
wanted
it
to
be
wow
quite
possibly
the
best
beer
this
brewery
makes
a
phenomenal
christmas
beer
and
one
of
the
most
flavorful
and
complex
beers
ive
had
all
year
amazing
on
tap
at
the
red
in
santa
cruz
pours
a
muddy
dark
brown
with
a
thick
tan
head
that
sticks
around
until
the
liquid
is
gone
great
thick
lacing
aroma
is
very
deep
with
fig
overripe
plum
green
apple
caramelized
orange
peel
ginger
phenols
and
a
touch
of
saccharine
cola
flavor
is
a
little
more
straightforward
rummy
raisins
orange
peel
ginger
and
licorice
alcohol
and
carbonation
are
a
bit
too
apparent
and
so
this
beer
is
not
particularly
drinkable
but
it
is
a
nice
warming
winter
treat
to
share
d
it
was
rather
difficult
for
me
to
down
my
chalicefull
of
this
beer
this
beer
is
10
abv
and
doesnt
hide
it
in
the
least
the
heat
from
the
alcohol
makes
it
difficult
to
drink
and
detracts
from
some
of
the
flavors
that
otherwise
may
emerge
i
sampled
ontap
but
i
think
getting
a
bottle
of
this
and
sitting
on
it
for
a
year
may
do
it
some
good
a
musthave
for
the
holidays
i
highley
recommend
this
one
for
the
holidays
notes
merry
christmas
to
me
overall
a
good
beer
but
slightly
overrated
too
much
carbonation
and
needs
to
be
a
little
thicker
for
my
liking
good
but
not
great
the
beer
pours
a
cloudy
brown
color
with
a
thick
frothy
tan
head
that
slowly
fades
to
lacing
the
aroma
is
good
it
has
a
rich
roasted
and
crystal
malt
scent
along
with
a
fruity
yeast
aroma
its
warming
to
the
nose
with
loads
of
fruity
esters
the
taste
is
good
as
well
it
has
a
solid
malt
bill
of
crystal
and
roasted
malts
its
complex
with
a
warm
fruity
finish
the
alcohol
is
right
up
front
the
mouthfeel
is
fine
it
is
a
full
bodied
beer
with
adequate
carbonation
this
is
a
damn
fine
seasonal
its
full
flavored
and
warming
just
what
i
want
in
the
colder
months
of
the
year
i
had
this
on
tap
at
monks
and
in
a
25oz
bottle
and
its
consistently
incredible
grab
a
bottle
of
this
while
its
around
you
could
session
with
this
if
you
pace
yourself
will
i
get
more
id
bet
on
that
overall
this
is
a
very
good
beer
that
everyone
should
try
this
time
of
the
year
another
good
beer
by
st
bernardus
very
drinkable
not
as
heavy
as
most
holiday
beers
very
nice
addition
to
the
bernardus
lineup
drinkoverall
im
certainly
glad
i
tried
it
well
worth
a
tastetesting
certainly
a
high
quality
beer
i
have
had
my
bottle
for
this
holiday
season
and
i
can
see
how
it
might
be
onebottleworthy
for
each
new
holiday
season

the
beer
is
a
rich

color

beer
from

for
me

checking

thats
what
youre
into

the
smoother
beers

nicest
christmas
ales
i
have
had
it
was
complimenting
the
cool
brisk
day
we
had
and
warmed
me
up
real
nice
and
fuzzy
like
try
it
and
love
it
d
pretty
easy
to

and
very
enjoyable

slowly

gobs

the

savor
this
flavorful
belgian
beauty
d
this
is
a
very
nice
xmas
beer
complex
yet
drinkable
another
excellent
brew
from
st
bernardus
a
must
for
any
belgain
fan
get
another
st
bernardus
offering
in
the
mix
drinkability
quite
good
i
will
probably
pick
up
a
couple
of
bottles
and
save
them
for
next
year
give
them
a
couple
of
good
shakes
to
get
the
yeast
going
again
overall
i
was
highly
impressed
with
this
offering
from
st
bernardus
quite
different
than
what
i
expected
from
a
holiday
beer
almost
like
a
chimay
blue
but
less
fruity
candi
sugar
and
caramel
malts
prevail
and
make
for
a
sweet
ride
throughout
the
experience
yet
it
is
well
balanced
with
slight
hop
notes
for
8
5012
oz
it
was
definitely
worth
every
drop
i
would
like
a
few
bottles
to
cellar
and
see
how
it
turns
out
next
year
an
excellent
accompaniment
for
a
fireside
chat
after
a
nice
holiday
dinner
highly
recommended
d
st
bernardus
once
again
makes
a
fantastic
beer
that
needs
to
be
sampled
by
all
deceptively
drinkable
plus
a
great
starter
ale
for
the
style
its
userfriendly
and
not
intimidating
perfect
for
sharing
at
holiday
gatherings
as
well
a
very
nice
beer
not
all
that
different
from
the
regular
abt
12
but
quite
delicious
nonetheless
dont
see
any
previous
reviews
of
this
beer
on
draft
so
im
assuming
this
may
be
the
first
year
for
this
beer
to
be
released
in
that
format
good
stuff
poured
into
my
new
st
bernardus
watou
over
sized
wine
glass
the
color
is
a
nice
brownamber
color
nice
carbonation
nice
onefinger
plus
foamy
light
tan
color
with
some
nice
small
islands
and
sticky
lacing
around
the
edges
the
nose
is
malyt
nice
touch
of
yeast
figs
raisins
plums
the
taste
is
sweet
maltyyeasty
nice
tones
of
dark
fruit
medium
body
the
alcohol
is
hidden
very
well
with
this
one
very
drinkable
another
awesome
brew
from
st
bernardus
drinkability
i
prefer
the
abt
12
but
this
is
one
i
can
look
forward
to
trying
again
come
christmas
time
would
make
a
heavenly
sipper
on
christmas
eve
or
night
shared
with
the
family
celebrating
the
holidays
d
this
is
one
of
the
best
christmas
beers
ive
had
its
very
complex
but
very
enjoyable
if
you
love
belgians
and
the
christmas
beer
style
then
this
ones
a
must
i
hope
we
get
this
close
to
louisiana
ill
definitely
crack
one
of
these
come
december
25th
the
only
thing
bad
i
have
to
say
about
this
beer
is
that
i
didnt
buy
enough
so
now
my
wife
and
i
will
have
to
wait
until
next
year
for
more
taste
is
controlled
by
the
load
of
fruits
but
not
entirely
sweet
some
yeastiness
can
make
out
some
alcohol
tones
way
too
carbonated
every
sip
and
drink
turns
into
foam
in
my
mouth
and
becomes
a
bit
distracting
similar
to
st
bernardus
in
many
ways
this
one
will
probably
age
beautifully
would
drink
again
hopefully
it
is
released
again
next
holiday
season
recommended
god
bless
st
bernardus
they
make
some
fine
beers
d
there
was
a
lot
of
carbonation
in
the
beer
making
it
challenging
to
really
enjoy
the
full
taste
of
the
beer
750
ml
bottle
served
in
a
chalice
the
beer
pours
dark
brown
with
an
inch
and
a
half
frothy
tan
head
head
retention
and
lacing
are
both
pretty
good
aroma
is
nice
it
smells
like
dark
fruit
cinnamon
bread
yeast
pepper
cloves
and
caramel
taste
is
similar
to
the
aroma
but
theres
also
a
good
bit
of
alcoholbooze
and
also
a
slight
metallic
taste
noticable
mouthfeelbody
is
medium
with
high
carbonation
way
too
much
carbonation
for
my
taste
this
hurts
the
drinkability
for
me
the
high
carbonation
makes
this
brew
hard
to
drink
it
feels
like
im
drinking
bubbles
and
not
liquid
overall
its
a
decent
brew
but
would
be
much
better
if
the
carbonation
was
cut
down
some
it
looks
good
and
tastes
good
but
its
not
easy
to
drink
at
all
d
the
abv
is
high
but
the
flavor
profile
makes
up
for
it
i
only
bought
one
bottle
so
i
will
have
to
sit
patiently
until
next
christmas
damn
drinkable
after
tasting
this
i
am
even
more
pissed
that
i
was
not
able
to
get
this
into
nebraska
this
winter
next
year
for
sure
this
beer
really
hit
the
spot
with
me
honestly
this
might
be
my
favorite
st
bernardus
beer
damn
damn
tasty

thanks
lexx
great
going
down
the
pipes
and
easy
to
drink
a
little
carbonation
for
the
bite
with
a
mix
of
an
alcohol
taste
if
you
let
it
rest
on
your
palate
you
will
truly
respect
the
flavor
in
this
beer
and
the
message
that
it
sends
to
your
brain
when
you
drink
it
it
is
a
great
holiday
treat
and
it
is
very
stimulating
for
relaxing
the
mind
after
a
long
week
of
work
good
stuff
poured
into
a
chalice
the
beer
had
a
nice
tan
two
inch
head
on
it
that
seemed
to
last
an
eternity
it
was
a
beautiful
shade
of
mahogony
brown
smell
seemed
very
bready
with
a
hint
of
maybe
figs
and
raisins
the
taste
had
a
lot
of
alcohol
alcohol
was
the
first
thing
that
i
could
tast
and
the
last
in
between
were
the
flavors
of
figs
a
faint
taste
of
anise
more
bread
and
a
hint
of
toffee
overall
a
very
nice
beer
to
wrap
up
to
on
a
very
cold
evening
it
did
seem
a
little
hot
but
over
the
course
of
the
bottle
and
as
it
warmed
to
room
temp
it
seemed
to
mellow
out
quite
a
bit
pours
brown
in
color
with
a
huge
offwhite
head
the
head
was
at
least
2
inches
and
took
several
minutes
to
fall
to
a
froth
smell
is
belgian
yeast
and
some
dark
fruit
figs
im
not
really
getting
a
lot
of
christmas
spice
or
taste
in
this
the
mouthfeel
is
full
and
creamy
very
nice
a
decent
beer
but
i
couldnt
help
but
to
get
something
metallic
out
of
the
taste
2007
good
looking
muddy
brown
brew
with
a
slight
orange
tinge
head
pours
large
and
stays
pretty
well
head
is
an
offwhite
tan
in
color
creamy
smooth
in
texture
and
has
nice
lacing
aroma
is
complex
with
cirtus
hoppyness
coming
throught
the
most
allspice
and
a
light
yeastydough
aroma
is
second
followed
by
many
other
smells
including
chocolate
apple
and
possibly
even
red
wine
flavor
was
pleasent
starting
on
the
sweetish
side
and
over
a
long
duration
finishing
ever
so
slightly
bittersour
with
defined
fruit
undertones
medium
in
body
with
a
lively
carbonated
but
creamy
texture
the
overall
mouth
feel
is
clearly
the
best
part
of
this
brew
pretty
good
stuff
done
of
my
least
favorite
of
st
b
lot
not
horrible
but
certainly
not
in
the
same
ballpark
as
some
of
my
favorites
of
theirs
too
much
air
heat
and
a
little
heavy
on

orange
edges
and
a
billowing
fluffy
cap
of
beige
foam
great
head
retention
with
chunky
clumps
of
foam
sticking
to
the
glass
at
first
then
some
spotty
lacing
later
great
aroma
figs
and
prunes
apple
cinnamon
bready
and
yeasty
floral
hops
bubblegum
pear
and
mild
medicinal
alcohol
sweet
with
some
warm
alcohol
up
front
dried
fruit
in
the
middle
with
bread
crust
towards
the
end
it
finished
with
a
flash
of
gingerbread
and
lingering
peppery
alcohol
medium
to
full
bodied
with
very
high
carbonation
palate
coating
with
a
bit
of
slickness
and
warmth
a
great
winter
warmer
with
pleasing
fruity
notes
im
betting
this
will
age
gracefully
a
good
ok
a
very
good
beer
in
my
mind
i
think
i
would
rather
have
the
plain
old
normal
st
bernardus
lineup
than
this
special
brew
but
thats
just
me
recommended
d
i
expected
a
big
beer
but
this
is
huge
very
complex
with
a
very
nice
wintry
roasted
quality
not
exactly
an
easily
drinkable
beer
but
my
overall
impression
is
very
favorable
considering
the
complexity
and
the
high
alcohol
content
i
am
inclined
to
think
that
this
would
age
very
well
i
also
think
that
with
its
smokey
tobacco
flavors
this
is
one
of
the
few
beers
i
have
had
that
could
really
stand
up
to
a
good
cigar
st
bernardus
christmas
ale
pours
a
mahogany
brown
with
a
huge
tan
head
from
a
brown
750
ml
bottle
the
aroma
is
spicy
the
taste
is
also
quite
spicy
almost
a
wintergreen
like
flavor
but
not
as
strong
spice
definitely
dominates
the
flavor
but
dark
fruits
are
also
present
a
very
enjoyable
christmas
beer
definitely
worth
a
try
overall
a
very
good
beer
its
no
anniversary
or
abt
12
but
still
worth
every
penny
for
a
solid
st
bernardus
dark
mahogany
body
thick
crop
of
beige
head
it
sticks
around
forever
though
it
does
diminish
ever
so
slightly
creating
a
rocky
landscape
on
top
of
the
nectar
very
inviting
nose
subtly
yet
very
pleasing
to
the
sense
of
smell
doughy
yeastiness
with
bready
malts
and
cinnamon
spiciness
blend
to
give
the
warm
aroma
of
comfort
biscuity
malt
base
serves
nicely
for
the
layers
of
complexity
on
top
spice
tones
intermingle
with
fruits
and
candy
light
alcoholic
tones
are
present
to
create
a
little
warmth
body
is
lightmedium
and
the
carbonation
lends
an
ever
so
sublte
effervescence
to
the
whole
experience
this
is
quite
enjoyable
and
im
not
exactly
surprised
being
that
it
comes
from
my
favorite
belgian
brewery
very
foamy
pour
i
had
to
use
a
3rd
glass
due
to
rapid
head
building
even
pouring
very
slowly
tan
head
is
very
rocky
with
small
bbublles
grading
to
large
bubbles
at
the
top
body
is
slighly
murky
dark
chocolate
color
with
very
active
carbonation
leaves
bubbly
spidery
lace
rich
and
malty
aroma
with
spice
herbs
and
a
little
fruit
apple
maybe
a
hint
of
chocolate
and
a
bit
of
alcohol
smell
as
well
big
malt
if
with
slightly
acidic
finish
that
is
long
lived
slowly
mellowing
to
a
pleasant
bitterness
on
the
tongue
full
bodied
with
creamy
texture
and
an
alcoholic
finish
overall
this
is
a
great
slow
taster
wthat
is
at
once
big
and
very
drinkable
muddy
bronze
color
with
a
goofy
head
aromas
of
bubble
gum
and
cough
medicine
not
in
a
bad
way
the
flavors
were
of
raisins
purple
popsicle
from
childhood
and
some
yeast
and
candi
sugar
this
may
be
good
after
a
year
in
the
basement
for
next
christmas
but
ill
take
the
abt
12
first
pours
a
clouded
dark
brown
with
a
good
sized
creme
head
that
leaves
a
decent
amount
of
lacing
on
the
way
down
nose
is
spices
and
yeast
flavor
is
extremely
heavy
on
the
spices
just
buckets
and
buckets
of
them
dough
rests
in
the
background
carbonation
is
extremely
full
and
attacks
the
tongue
liquid
is
as
it
should
be
this
is
definitely
a
winter
style
brew
it
is
so
spice
forward
and
heavy
on
the
body
that
it
is
to
be
sipped
and
savored
over
time
a
nice
brew
for
sure
one
of
the
nicest
christmas
beers
i
had
this
year
im
really
glad
that
st
bernardus
decided
to
make
and
bottle
this
brew
it
is
still
a
little
sharp
i
think
a
little
time
in
the
bottle
will
smooth
out
the
edges
nevertheless
it
is
still
delicious
now
pours
a
beautiful
dark
brown
with
a
batter
like
head
big
thick
and
creamy
and
which
leaves
excellent
lacing
aromas
of
sweet
malt
banana
alcohol
and
cookie
dough
well
carbonated
with
flavors
of
pffefernuse
black
pepper
clove
cinnamon
coriander
and
cookie
dough
not
overly
sweet
in
fact
there
is
a
dry
somewhat
astringent
bitterness
throughout
that
nicely
offsets
the
spice
cookie
flavors
delicious
mouthfeel
is
carbonated
full
spicy
and
creamy
drinkability
should
improve
with
a
few
more
months
in
the
cellar
a
great
addition
to
the
belgian
winter
repertoire
i
will
be
adding
this
to
the
winter
lineup
every
year
not
bad
but
im
not
sure
its
anything
ill
pick
up
again
unless
its
on
sale
drinkability

this
is
a
terrific
addition
to
the
st
bernie
inventory
its
a
wonderful
wintertime
specialty
ale
d

this
is
a
very
nice
christmas
ale
it
is
quite
a
lot
to
handle
in
one
sitting
i
might
have
to
pick
up
another
and
cellar
it
the
bottle
claims
it
can
be
cellared
for
up
to
15
years
warming
alcohol
frothy
carbonation
gives
this
a
medium
body
feel
a
big
beer
with
layers
of
character
very
nice
this
was
a
damn
nice
beer
not
surprisingly
it
was
rather
complex
yet
very
well
balanced
a
great
beer
that
would
be
perfect
to
take
the
chill
off
any
beer
lover
that
said
i
do
think
this
would
as
the
bottle
indicates
benefit
from
a
few
years
well
maybe
more
than
a
few
of
cellaring
to
round
it
off
and
soften
those
edges
they
suggest
up
to
15
years
not
sure
i
could
wait
that
long
but
i
do
think
a
few
years
would
definitely
reward
the
cellarer
cellarer
with
a
more
robust
full
beer
it
would
take
a
very
very
strong
cheese
to
hold
up
to
this
a
great
belgian
winter
ale
definitely
recommenced
strongly
suggested
as
a
cellaring
candidate
but
definitely
worth
at
least
one
bottles
worth
of
enjoyment
now
mouthfeel
is
medium
full
and
lingering
of
raisins
fig
newtons
fennel
sweet
nougat
caramel
and
pine
needels
d
good
drinkability
due
to
the
fact
that
the
alcohol
is
nowhere
to
be
found
especially
for
a
10
brew
this
was
a
good
offering
but
i
think
that
this
one
will
likely
get
better
with
a
little
aging
this
offering
from
st
bernardus
pours
a
delicious
dark
brown
leaving
a
thick
tan
head
that
is
frothy
and
typical
from
the
previous
offerings
from
st
bernardus
the
aroma
is
very
fruity
plums
figs
dates
brown
sugar
sweet
earthy
spices
and
dark
pitted
fruit
there
is
also
a
faint
sour
fruit
aspect
in
the
back
of
this
brew
but
nothing
over
powering
the
taste
starts
matly
fruit
brown
sugar
spiced
seasoning
just
a
fantastic
array
of
flavors
and
aromas
massaging
the
palate
the
finish
is
slightly
tart
on
the
back
of
the
throat
hard
to
make
out
any
specific
christmas
spices
in
this
brew
but
that
doesnt
matter
to
me
a
quality
brew
made
for
sipping
at
10
abv
the
alcohol
presence
is
barely
visible
well
hidden
in
this
beer
drank
this
one
after
everyone
left
on
christmas
day
good
way
to
finish
the
holidays
the
taste
is
similar
to
the
aroma
very
spicy
more
so
than
their
other
beers
seems
as
though
there
is
a
touch
of
cinnamon
to
go
along
with
the
clove
and
ginger
a
very
fruity
and
bananalike
yeast
presence
nice
beer
and
a
nice
way
to
enjoy
christmas
not
my
favorite
of
their
beers
with
all
of
the
spice
that
brings
the
drinkability
down
some
carbonation
is
high
but
with
a
couple
swirls
it
becomes
less
prickly
and
lets
the
body
of
the
beer
shine
this
was
quite
the
treat
so
complex
and
drinkable
a
perfect
winter
companion
drinkability
a
fine
holiday
sipper
regardless
of
the
10
abv
that
made
for
pleasant
christmas
day
drinking
christmas
eve
seemed
an
appropriate
time
top
open
this
beer
it
was
very
dark
brown
with
a
white
head
and
the
bubbles
seemed
really
compacted
together
it
smelled
like
slight
herbal
mints
whiff
of
chocolate
barely
detectable
and
raisins
the
flavor
was
raisin
and
plumlike
decent
stuff
but
the
10
5
abv
knocked
me
down
drinkability
is
not
good
for
me
wouldnt
want
to
try
this
one
again
find
this
a
problem
with
belgians
sometimes
just
too
much
co2
for
my
tastes
looked
great
smelled
great
first
sip
ruined
it
for
me
as
i
finished
the
bottle
co2
did
mellow
some
what
but
still
too
much
for
me
wanted
to
like
it
but
1225
edit
this
left
me
with
probably
my
biggest
hangover
of
the
year
i
dont
know
what
the
deal
is
its
not
as
if
ive
never
had
a
750
of
strong
beer
to
myself
be
careful
with
this
one
a
very
good
brew
but
not
spectacular
as
i
expected
from
st
bernardus
murky
brown
in
appearance
a
very
dense
thick
off
white
head
pillow
like
sticky
lacing
that
hangs
around
aromas
of
raisins
tons
of
other
dark
fruits
and
spices
well
blended
flavors
of
dark
fruits
tart
grape
candied
sugar
mild
chocolate
and
some
spices
of
clove
and
cinnamon
finishes
with
some
warming
alcohol
mouth
feel
is
creamy
and
smooth
highly
carbonated
very
fizzy
drinkability
is
excellent
and
very
enjoyable
very
similar
to
abt
12
if
you
like
boozy
beers
then
this
ones
for
you
cheers
the
perfect
looking
belgian
brew
deep
murky
brown
with
dark
ruby
highlights
and
a
great
thick
retaining
head
the
only
thing
that
its
look
is
lacking
is
the
bubbling
the
aroma
is
very
belgian
and
awesome
in
that
sense
but
not
very
christmasy
makes
me
think
of
figs
and
sweet
bread
the
taste
is
very
pretty
sweet
and
complex
lots
of
brown
sugar
with
some
with
a
few
spices
hints
of
clove
and
cinnamon
but
just
not
as
seasonal
as
expected
well
two
days
till
christmas
so
time
to
pop
the
cork
on
this
one
the
bottle
poured
ruby
red
with
a
large
billowy
light
coco
brown
head
aromas
of
belgium
yeast
fruit
and
spices
cinnamon
ginger
and
clove
filled
my
nose
this
ale
has
a
full
creamy
mouth
feel
with
carbonation
that
tickles
the
tongue
the
first
thing
i
noticed
about
the
flavors
was
sweet
fruit
figs
and
raisins
with
a
nice
balance
of
christmas
spices
a
nice
bitter
finish
that
is
not
to
over
whelming
almost
the
typical
peppery
bite
the
alcohol
is
extremely
well
hidden
and
this
beer
will
sneak
up
on
you
great
holiday
offering
from
st
bernardus
hope
to
find
another
one
for
next
year
drinkability
too
sweet
and
spicy
d
im
conflicted
this
beer
needs
some
time
to
lay
down
but
i
fear
that
the
spices
will
be
lost
well
its
way
too
hot
now
but
im
reviewing
it
for
what
it
is
its
taking
me
a
while
to
get
through
it
and
as
the
flavor
is
good
its
horribly
unbalanced
right
now
deeply
malty
flavors
with
light
fruit
and
nuttiness
a
bit
too
sweet
for
my
taste
but
its
not
overdone
dry
finish
hints
at
the
high
abv
but
its
hidden
in
the
taste
im
happy
that
i
shared
this
at
a
holiday
party
instead
of
trying
to
drink
the
whole
thing
myself
another
beer
of
the
highest
quality
from
st
bernardus
of
course
thats
to
be
expected
this
beer
has
some
really
nice
christmas
spicing
overall
this
is
a
solid
beer
but
not
as
good
as
i
expected
it
to
be
compared
to
the
abt
12
the
alcohol
is
more
noticable
and
it
is
less
complex
that
being
said
it
was
still
tasty
and
easy
to
drink
wow
great
stuff
no
big
surprise
really
st
b
knows
how
to
impress
and
this
is
perfect
for
the
holidays
not
a
bad
beer
but
i
think
i
expected
a
little
better
from
st
b
not
the
hilight
of
the
season
served
at
cellar
temp
d
smooth
and
balanced
strong
ale
milder
spice
flavors
and
lively
carbonation
contribute
to
a
unique
taste
profile
very
easydrinking
but
best
enjoyed
sipping
slowly
on
a
cold
night
d
wow
this
is
a
fine
fine
beer
would
you
expect
anything
else
but
i
think
more
than
1
750
ml
of
this
would
be
crazy
luckily
i
split
mine
with
my
gf
and
i
think
1
glass
will
be
enough
really
enjoyable
and
warming
me
up
nicely
highly
recommended
for
the
holidays
the
beer
was
dark
brown
with
a
thick
head
but
lacked
the
floaties
from
abt
12
and
the
creaminess
in
the
foam
that
abt
12
provides
still
looked
ok
just
closer
ot
the
prior
8
in
appearance
the
aroma
was
the
signature
yeastie
fruitiness
but
with
a
hint
of
spice
i
havent
noticed
in
the
sibling
beers
this
spice
came
through
in
the
flavor
as
a
peppery
note
a
little
biting
im
not
sure
how
to
record
it
except
cracked
pepper
very
nice
definitely
youd
know
in
a
blind
taste
test
who
made
it
but
youd
also
know
it
was
a
little
different
highly
recommended
along
with
all
their
other
beers
this
is
another
prodigious
offering
from
st
bernardus
this
pours
a
deep
brown
with
a
frothy
thick
dark
head
that
plumes
on
the
sides
of
the
glass
and
leaves
tons
of
lacing
the
beer
also
retains
quite
well
with
soapy
head
still
lingering
in
my
fluted
glass
well
after
ive
had
a
few
sips
the
smell
is
sweet
malts
candied
sugars
yeastiness
xmas
spices
such
as
nutmeg
allspice
cinnamon
and
orange
rind
the
carbonation
of
this
beer
will
keep
you
burping
and
then
some
this
is
a
medium
bodied
beer
that
hits
all
the
right
notes
the
taste
is
very
belgian
throughout
youll
get
the
candied
sugars
malty
sweetness
spices
yeasty
bite
and
the
sweet
caramel
and
butterscotch
flavors
the
high
abv
is
masked
over
quite
well
although
there
are
some
warming
alcohol
notes
that
arise
towards
the
end
the
aftertaste
is
very
modest
all
things
considered
this
one
is
well
worth
seeking
out
lchaim
a
750ml
bottle
poured
into
a
goblet
medium
brown
color
with
red
highlights
a
very
thick
tan
head
almost
the
appearance
of
whipped
cream
nice
aroma
of
dark
fruit
and
some
sugar
similar
taste
but
there
was
also
a
pronounced
spiciness
that
lingered
really
well
a
great
after
dinner
sipping
beer
overall
recommended
while
not
my
favorite
from
st
bernardus
it
is
still
very
tasty
and
very
drinkable
a
good
beverage
warming
alcoholic
spicy
a
blast
of
pepper
and
malt
and
somehow
not
quite
what
i
expected
from
st
bernardus
a
bit
less
a
wee
bit
theres
burnished
cherries
theres
raisins
and
dates
and
more
purchased
plaza
liquors
tucson
az
im
going
to
save
a
bottle
for
next
christmas
this
should
hold
up
really
well
70ml
corked
and
caged
bottle
poured
into
a
st
bernardus
chalice
pours
a
dark
brown
color
with
a
large
tan
head
with
excellent
retention
and
lacing
the
aroma
is
sweet
malt
dark
fruits
spices
and
yeast
the
taste
is
sweet
malt
and
an
array
of
spices
with
a
rather
dry
spicy
and
boozy
finish
overall
this
is
another
good
beer
from
st
bernardus
i
am
curious
to
see
how
this
one
ages
it
should
improve
greatly
with
a
little
more
time
poured
a
rich
dirty
brown
into
goblets
with
a
spotty
dark
head
lacing
lasted
through
to
the
end
piney
smell
and
the
taste
was
full
of
spices
a
touch
of
bitterness
showed
through
perhaps
making
it
taste
even
more
like
christmas
i
poured
it
chilled
initially
and
wasnt
very
impressed
but
it
improved
tremendously
as
it
warmed
up
a
bit
great
to
have
by
the
fire
during
the
holiday
season
and
the
bottle
size
makes
it
nice
to
share
with
friendsfamily
d
alcohol
barely
makes
its
presence
felt
in
either
aroma
or
taste
but
boy
does
it
ever
warm
the
cheeks
this
is
friggin
christmas
in
a
bottle
d
st
bernys
has
yet
to
let
me
down
and
once
again
they
pull
off
another
great
beer
wish
you
could
find
this
in
vegas
i
would
love
to
have
a
few
of
these
closer
to
christmas
also
i
think
it
would
be
great
with
a
year
or
two
on
it
one
fine
specimen
rich
with
tingly
carbonation
and
a
good
amount
of
acidity
really
lively
on
the
tongue
full
of
fig
notes
with
a
bit
of
carmelized
pear
brown
sugar
and
cinnamon
great
balance
with
a
bitterness
on
the
finish
spicey
belgian
qualities
and
a
yeasty
finish
but
not
overly
done
good
amounts
of
alcohol
on
the
finish
in
the
chest
as
well
a
definite
winner
drinkability

this
is
a
terrific
addition
to
the
st
bernie
inventory
its
a
wonderful
wintertime
specialty
ale
this
is
a
fantastic
beer
but
one
for
the
evening
is
plenty
d
i
think
i
have
found
the
ultimate
beer
to
pair
with
pumpkin
pie
in
this
one
full
of
rich
complex
dark
flavours
st
bernardus
christmas
ale
is
a
worldclass
yule
beer
made
by
one
of
the
best
producers
in
belgium
i
really
liked
this
beer
tastemouthfeel
dark
dried
fruits
caramel
a
bit
of
molasses
dry
and
spicy
in
the
finish
with
a
greater
hop
presence
than
i
was
expecting
crisp
but
soft
carbonation
similar
to
other
st
bernardus
brews
this
is
nice
but
i
think
it
will
drink
better
with
5
or
6
months
on
it
recommended
hazy
reddish
brown
w
tons
of
bubbles
and
huge
off
white
head
great
belgian
lace
and
great
retention
i
was
surprised
by
the
hop
character
that
was
really
really
present
in
the
nose
i
imagine
that
will
mellow
out
with
time
and
i
am
exited
to
see
how
this
will
tate
next
year
nose
was
musty
earthy
hops
malt
spice
cinnamon
ginger
dark
fruit
and
booze
taste
was
dark
fruit
roast
spice
hops
and
hints
of
booze
in
both
the
nose
and
the
taste
i
could
detect
something
new
every
pass
i
think
this
one
needs
a
little
time
but
the
full
body
which
seems
lighter
because
of
the
heavy
carbonation
is
smooth
and
this
is
another
solid
solid
beer
from
one
of
my
favorite
breweries
this
beer
poured
a
cloudy
dark
amber
color
and
formed
a
very
airy
large
head
that
coated
the
glass
with
lace
as
it
slowly
subsided
a
heavy
amount
of
carbonation
is
present
an
aroma
of
malt
yeast
and
candy
the
flavor
was
of
malt
caramel
and
candy
fairly
light
compared
to
other
styles
by
this
brewery
the
finish
was
quite
sprite
not
a
bad
beer
but
not
up
to
the
others
from
the
brewery
aging
may
help
this
one
to
improve
caged
750
with
a
loud
pop
upon
opening
poured
heavy
into
a
st
bernardus
glass
massive
tan
head
that
slowly
dissipates
to
a
pillow
cover
very
large
bubbles
color
is
murky
brown
typical
but
nice
leaves
icicle
like
lacing
around
the
sides
even
though
the
bottle
suggests
drinking
this
a
bit
cold
for
the
style
id
really
recommend
letting
this
one
warm
up
a
bit
i
was
slightly
disappointed
when
i
first
cracked
this
onebut
now
with
a
little
more
than
a
half
left
in
the
bottle
at
a
warmer
temp
this
is
a
fantastic
beer
glad
i
bought
a
few
bottles
nice
addition
the
bernardus
lineup
rather
carbonated
but
its
the
nice
small
bubble
thick
carbonation
ive
grown
to
love
that
leaves
a
velvet
mouthfeel
with
just
a
bit
of
a
bite
i
rate
this
high
on
drinkability
because
i
think
i
could
sit
around
and
sip
on
this
all
night
long
its
not
drinkable
in
the
usual
sense
of
the
word
but
being
so
highly
enjoyable
you
dont
want
your
glass
to
ever
empty
a
good
beer
but
pales
in
comparison
with
its
other
illustrious
brethren
not
a
fair
standard
i
suppose
since
most
other
beers
do
as
well
the
beer
is
very
carbonated
maybe
a
little
too
much
since
it
stings
a
bit
as
it
rests
on
the
tongue
i
feel
that
the
carbonation
imparts
a
bit
on
the
flavors
it
would
be
a
little
easier
to
detect
more
flavors
with
less
carbonation
let
this
one
get
to
room
temp
though
it
gets
a
little
better
and
less
carbonation
sting
more
creamy
and
warm
than
dry
and
spicy
theres
a
barleywine
character
to
the
lavish
texture
but
keeps
the
brunt
of
twelvepercent
held
in
check
peppery
bourbony
and
numbing
on
the
tongue
the
ale
echoes
with
the
whimsy
of
oak
spice
vanilla
and
dry
caramel
on
the
tongue
is
a
light
booziness
maple
an
oakey
malt
coconut
and
a
slight
honey
candy
it
ends
with
a
bit
of
alcohol
but
it
remains
super
smooth
throughout
o
two
years
of
aging
seems
to
have
meshed
the
flavors
brilliantly
the
base
quad
gives
lots
of
dark
fruit
flavors
that
mix
nicely
with
the
barrel
notes
very
well
done
tmo
really
complex
and
flavorful
toasted
caramel
toffee
with
a
thick
glazing
of
raw
bourbony
vanilla
oak
rich
decadent
and
strong
wood
presence
very
well
rounded
beer
with
a
fantastic
flavor
surprisingly
light
and
thin
but
overall
super
tasty
and
although
somewhat
hot
the
booze
is
well
integrated
for
the
strength
worth
seeking
out
barrel
aged
caramel
a
little
more
body
would
do
wonders
for
this
beer
but
there
are
some
great
carameltoffeeoakbourbon
notes
to
this
beer
total
4150
this
beer
is
one
of
my
favorites
boozy
caramel
and
vanilla
notes
play
together
nicely
with
the
cru
i
believe
they
changed
the
bourbon
barrels
this
year
in
my
opinion
for
the
better
it
seems
more
vanillay
than
last
years
my
only
qualm
with
this
beer
is
the
price
at
14
99
a
bottle
i
would
think
twice
about
stocking
up
on
a
bunch
of
bottles
but
ill
always
get
it
on
draft
if
available
d
this
was
a
delicious
beer
not
as
much
quad
character
but
tons
of
tasty
bourbon
the
finish
was
hot
so
must
be
sipped
age
would
likely
really
help
fresh
is
still
really
enjoyable
in
small
doses
serving
type
bottle
ooverall
a
great
quad
with
the
bourbon
very
is
to
drink
and
the
abv
can
sneak
up
of
you
o
tasty
i
would
like
to
see
a
touch
more
of
the
barrel
flavor
but
the
base
beer
is
delicious
and
the
bourbon
notes
definitely
pull
it
up
into
a
higher
level
tasty
enjoyable
and
dangerously
quaffable
overall
this
beer
is
enjoyable
and
i
would
score
it
higher
if
it
didnt
claim
to
be
a
quad
because
on
that
mark
it
falls
short
it
tastes
more
like
a
barrelaged
english
old
ale
call
it
that
and
it
would
be
in
the
4
range
cant
go
wrong
here
if
you
are
a
bourbon
stout
drinkier
overall
a
very
impressive
quad
poured
a
reddish
brown
with
minimal
head
i
do
pick
up
traces
of
plum
and
raisin
as
stated
on
label
but
mostly
pick
up
an
oaky
boozy
aroma
replete
with
caramel
toffee
and
black
cherry
aroma
i
did
find
this
beer
boozy
at
first
even
a
little
heat
but
it
mellowed
as
i
sipped
and
sipped
touches
of
tart
cherry
sticky
caramel
toffee
possible
vanilla
and
raisin
smooth
fuller
body
thanks
to
the
barrels
overall
a
good
beer
but
not
something
i
would
label
quad
at
least
not
in
the
traditional
sense
nonetheless
an
enjoyable
beer
that
is
a
pleasure
to
relax
with
overall
it
starts
out
very
impressive
but
for
a
barrel
aged
quad
this
really
let
me
down
o
this
does
an
excellent
job
of
providing
bourbon
qualities
without
the
heat
as
a
quad
though
its
not
very
successful
there
isnt
much
sense
of
complexity
or
boldness
but
you
know
what
i
like
it
to
an
extent
i
wont
have
much
trouble
killing
this
by
myself
overall
impression
a
comparatively
less
complex
quad
than
the
true
belgian
trappists
but
with
some
interesting
bourbon
notes
that
make
for
an
interesting
sipper
much
closer
to
an
abbey
quad
than
a
trappist
style
quad
because
of
sweet
finish
another
tasty
treat
from
hardywood
thanks
colin
same
for
the
flavor
raisony
caramel
and
vanilla
bourbon
flavors
are
dominant
woody
and
boozey
vineous
finish
its
packed
with
flavor
its
very
dry
and
boozey
but
really
amazing
sipper
awesome
brew
and
a
style
not
often
aged
in
bourbon
barrels
but
after
having
this
they
should
highly
recommend
this
brew
sort
of
a
weird
one
here
dubbed
a
quad
im
not
sure
it
meets
those
specs
it
pours
a
pink
hued
burnt
orange
color
with
just
some
suds
along
the
edges
the
nose
is
real
sweet
real
alcoholic
and
real
bourbon
heavy
some
figs
and
brown
sugar
as
well
and
a
spice
element
its
pretty
crowded
the
flavor
boasts
a
nice
belgian
yeast
which
is
about
as
quad
as
it
gets
the
rest
is
punishingly
sweet
under
carbonated
and
a
little
thin
it
just
lacks
the
depts
of
a
good
quad
despite
flashing
all
of
that
in
the
aroma
i
taste
alcohol
soaked
raisins
too
which
is
the
best
flavor
feature
thin
on
the
body
unsatisfying
in
that
way
because
it
doesnt
hold
up
with
all
the
booze
which
becomes
too
intense
with
all
the
sugar
in
the
sweetness
a
tough
combination
for
drinkability
and
when
combined
with
not
quite
enough
bubbles
it
drags
a
bit
still
though
an
interesting
release
and
a
beer
that
might
do
well
with
some
age
thanks
to
drlovemd87
for
exposing
me
to
this
oddball
overall
nice
beer
not
as
alcohol
influenced
as
the
smell
lead
me
to
believe
drinks
more
like
a
strong
ale
then
a
quad
lacking
the
sweet
yeast
kick
that
so
many
quads
have
alcohol
is
masked
really
well
making
this
really
drinkable
another
great
beer
from
hardywood
o
a
good
and
interesting
beer
overall
i
suspect
an
infection
but
so
far
its
worked
for
the
beers
favor
o
overall
i
enjoyed
this
pretty
well
i
have
not
had
a
ton
of
crus
per
se
but
this
is
one
of
the
more
interesting
that
i
have
had
a
greenhorn
barrel
aged
cru
with
notes
of
vanilla
toffee
and
bourbon
definitely
would
have
again
thanks
to
matt

picking
this
up

just
a
touch
of
bourbon
in
the
background

nothing
really
belgian
about
this
flavor
is
similar
too
heavy
on
the
sugar
without
much
barrel
and
no
notes
from
belgian

boring
o
an
outstanding
beer
that
i
would
recommend
to
anyone
who
like
or
dislikes
beer
bourbon
cru
brings
a
new
depth
to
beer
that
is
unparalleled
overall
quite
nice
malts
are
nice
hops
add
a
decent
lighter
touch
and
most
of
all
the
bourbon
barrel
really
adds
nicely
o
overall
this
was
a
very
enjoyable
beer
the
bourbon
was
strong
but
i
enjoyed
that
immensely
delicious

slightly

this
beer
has
a
good
level
of
carbonation
with
a
crisp

overall
this
is
a
good
beer
that
is
tasty
and
drinkable
beer
is
thick
and
sweet
with
a
boozy
finish
hard
to
drink
not
very
enjoyable
i
dont
think
this
will
be
a
repeat
for
me
d
solid
stuff
but
not
something
id
be
able
to
drink
in
large
quantities
i
wish
the
whiskey
wasnt
so
overpowering
executed
well
enough
that
im
interested
in
trying
other
offerings
from
hardywood
park
as
this
isnt
the
easiest
style
to
impress
with
overall
very
good
but
very
strong
even
for
a
10
percent
beer
te
alcohol
is
strong
with
the
bourbon
but
this
one
makes
it
to
your
head
even
faster
than
expected
many
solid
offerings
from
this
brewery
o
a
good
but
not
great
beer
a
barrel
alone
does
not
make
a
beer
great
and
in
this
case
i
think
hardywoods
base
beer
is
lacking
in
robust
flavor
it
drinks
a
bit
thin
all
the
same
this
is
a
quality
offering
and
i
encourage
you
to
give
it
a
tick
if
the
opportunity
presents
itself
overall
i
thought
the
bourbon
flavors
were
fantastic
they
managed
to
get
all
the
really
great
flavors
out
of
the
barrel
without
much
boozy
alcohol
at
all
the
beer
flavors
however
seemed
a
little
overly
sweet
and
sugary
to
me
with
the
lighter
crisp
fruits
being
the
focus
of
that
component
i
think
it
could
have
used
a
little
more
of
a
darker
fruit
character
and
a
little
more
balance
to
the
sweetness
i
loved
the
bourbon
flavors
though
i
look
forward
to
more
greatness
from
this
brewery
a
nice
deep
copper
tone
that
kept
quite
clear
until
i
poured
the
sediment
in
it
sported
a
light
white
cap
that
dissipated
shortly
thereafter
very
excited
for
the
first
sip
you
can
definitely
taste
the
quad
a
delicate
front
with
notes
of
caramel
and
toffee
bringing
forth
a
multilayered
experience
with
malt
bread
vanilla
oak
and
raisins
the
bourbon
accents
the
beer
rather
than
dominating
some
may
say
that
the
bourbon
is
too
light
but
i
found
this
to
be
a
good
quality
of
the
beer
a
bit
prickly
on
the
palate
had
to
swirl
it
a
bit
to
reduce
carbonation
but
overall
a
very
tactfully
crafted
beer
from
a
brewery
that
deserves
attention
it
is
absolutely
all
i
could
have
hoped
for
from
a
bourbon
barrel
quad
i
hesitate
to
say
perfect
but
then
i
say
it
anyway
watch
out
for
hardywood
park
folks
good
things
in
the
making
o
very
strong
brew
from
a
relatively
new
brewery
here
in
richmond
i
got
9
bottles
from
the
release
and
i
am
ecstatic
i
was
very
impressed
with
the
bourbon
barrelaged
quad
pours
with
almost
no
head
nice
dark
cloudy
cola
color
lots
of
sweet
malty
aromas
the
flavor
is
a
bit
young
i
cant
figure
out
the
vintage
but
im
assuming
its
a
2014
i
think
this
will
round
out
with
age
not
as
nice
as
other
belgian
quads
but
very
drinkable
o
perhaps
less
complex
when
compared
to
the
elite
quads
mainly
due
to
a
quieter
yeast
contribution
but
oh
my
god
does
it
make
up
for
it
with
sheer
drinkability
the
texture
in
particular
is
sinful
in
its
decadence
the
idea
of
a
moreish
quad
is
a
dangerous
notion
but
thats
what
we
have
here
every
sip
is
a
delight
to
the
senses
overall
its
a
decent
quad
but
not
quite
getting
the
dark
fruit
flavors
and
sweetness
that
i
prefer
in
my
quads
where
this
is
a
tad
dry
and
bitter
the
taste
is
strong
with
a
nutty
light
toffee
and
slight
fruity
earthy
flavor
similar
to
stone
fruit
with
gently
spiced
quality
and
mild
alcohol
in
the
taste
as
it
warms
with
a
light
dark
sugar
flavor
in
the
finish
with
some
residual
sweetness
overall
a
very
good
dark
belgian
ale
with
nice
yeast
flavor
and
dry
drinkable
aspect
without
a
lot
of
alcohol
in
the
taste
overall
wow
this
was
one
badass
beer
i
will
be
looking
for
more
from
this
brewery
in
the
future
because
this
was
a
real
treat
overall
drinkability
this
may
be
my
new
favorite
quad
such
a
wonderful
deepness
of
flavor
all
around
and
a
very
nice
aroma
as
well
this
is
a
beer
for
having
one
of
and
savoring
over
an
evening
and
yet
with
it
being
so
tasty
i
found
i
finished
it
rather
quickly
the
alcohol
is
dangerously
well
hidden
and
im
glad
i
knew
this
was
11
when
i
ordered
the
25cl
glass
otherwise
i
think
i
would
be
in
trouble
later
i
will
have
to
find
this
beer
again
very
well
done
nice
falvor
and
color
steel
taste
this
beer
is
very
different
from
what
i
was
expecting
the
strong
fruitiness
was
surprising
and
made
for
a
unique
beer
the
alcohol
is
detectable
but
not
overpowering
i
would
drink
it
again
on
occasion
but
it
is
definitely
not
an
everyday
beer
for
me

this
would
go
well
with
a
spiced
cake
or
bread
pudding
it
just
really
isnt
worth
the
money
or
time
plenty
of
other
good
quads
belgain
darks
i
give
it
67100
bit
of
a
let
down
in
the
nose
there
were
apple
and
raisin
aromas
but
they
were
sugary
and
had
an
over
done
almost
burnt
quality
gentle
flowery
heat
as
well
tastes
as
the
smell
suggested
it
would
unfortunately
that
burnt
quality
comes
across
even
stronger
on
the
tongue
it
doesnt
dominate
the
flavor
profile
i
tasted
sugary
dark
fruits
aplenty
but
it
is
impossible
to
ignore
it
lingers
along
with
some
vaguely
medicinal
alcoholic
heat
this
falls
far
short
of
the
best
examples
of
the
style
too
many
readily
available
great
quads
out
there
i
should
have
passed
on
this
one
low
carbonation
taste
of
blak
cherry
and
some
other
dark
fruits
very
good

no

taste
o
great
for
sipping
i
think
the
higher
carbonation
and
good
balance
between
sweet
and
malt
flavours
gives
this
beer
an
edge
over
other
quads
ive
tried
plus
it
looks
great

with

bottle
o
awesome
brew
i
got
this
one
at
bruisin
ales
in
asheville
drank
it
in
new
hamburg
on
aug
19
2014
o
this
is
a
very
solid
and
drinkable
quadrupel
it
never
seems
like
a
beer
with
an
11
abv
quite
tasty
and
easy
to
drink
drink
a
little
more
anisepeppery
bite
than
i
like
but
still
and
great
mix
of
complex
flavours
and
a
perfect
mouthfeel
the
alcohol
is
well
hidden
and
the
mix
of
flavours
makes
this
a
great
sipper
its
spicy
bitterness
continues
to
develop
deep
in
finish
as
the
ale
turns
decidedly
warm
spicy
and
peppery
taking
on
spiced
rum
proportions
with
that
tangy
red
wine
tartness
the
taste
concludes
with
port
and
effervescence
not
the
best
quad
ive
ever
had
but
still
damn
good
pours
a
brilliant
deep
brown
with
a
lingering
frothy
khaki
head
aroma
is
slightly
sweet
with
dark
candi
sugar
and
subtle
plum
and
date
notes
fairly
difficult
to
get
much
aroma
flavor
reveals
deeply
caramelized
toffeelike
malt
character
at
the
backbone
with
prunes
and
dates
adding
contrast
the
finish
is
dry
and
somewhat
bitter
with
a
touch
of
roast
not
as
sweet
as
i
anticipated
the
finish
is
more
bitter
than
expected
as
well
malt
character
lacks
complexity
this
is
a
beer
and
brewery
that
ive
never
even
heard
about
probably
saw
it
on
the
shelves
in
ft
collins
but
never
noticed
but
i
really
like
this
one
a
lot
it
has
a
comforting
feel
to
it
serving
type
large
bottle
11
alcohol
anno
1856
with
a
half
moon
face
on
the
bottle
label
says
bruges
quadruple
ale
ii
o
really
nice
beer
but
not
one
of
the
best
ive
drunk
a
notch
or
two
above
a
standard
american
brewed
quad
but
not
quite
up
to
the
level
of
my
favorite
belgian
brewed
still
this
is
a
welcome
addition
to
my
readily
abailable
quad
arsenal
overall
i
forgot
how
i
do
really
love
quads
and
this
one
was
done
so
well
highly
recommended
bottle
but
the
lack
of
carbonation
for
a
belgian
is
severely
disappointing
overall
i
dont
drink
quads
often
but
i
do
like
this
beer
it
is
not
complex
but
has
a
nice
dried
fruit
flavor
the
alcohol
is
tame
and
provides
a
comforting
warmth
throughout
the
drink
overall
this
beer
brought
a
look
of
disbelief
to
my
face
the
smell
of
the
beer
made
me
expect
something
completely
different
than
i
tasted
after
you
let
it
warm
a
bit
it
only
gets
better
to
a
point
and
you
can
taste
things
that
were
necessarily
present
before
hope
that
helps
and
enjoy
o
overall
im
not
really
sure
seems
to
have
a
rather
unique
flavor
but
a
touch
harsh
and
a
bit
sweet
at
the
same
time
there
is
definitely
less
typical
belgian
flavors
in
this
guy
but
perhaps
thats
the
grain
pushing
through
while
the
taste
is
completely
different
it
almost
reminds
me
a
little
of
duchesse
in
a
yin
and
yang
type
of
way
o
truly
delicious
poured
from
a
brown
11
2
oz
bottle
has
a
very
dark
brown
color
with
a
small
head
smell
is
of
dark
fruits
alcohol
some
malts
taste
is
complex
dark
fruits
yeast
some
alcohol
heat
malts
a
touch
of
tartness
lots
going
on
here
feels
medium
bodied
in
the
mouth
and
overall
is
a
solid
beer
o
great
quadruppel
but
a
bit
unbalanced
alcohol
and
spices
but
hey
still
a
great
one
o
in
no
way
is
this
a
bad
beer
but
i
expected
better
doesnt
hold
a
candle
to
rochefort
10
but
an
enjoyable
beer
for
sure
o
great
beer
to
end
the
day
with
an
easy
sipper
that
is
well
worth
checking
out
very
well
done
overall
quite
a
good
quad
o
great
beer
hits
a
bunch
of
high
notes
deep

thin

brown
sugar
caramel
and
roasted

taste
is
mildly

with
notes

sweet
boozy
finish
with
a
bit
of
an
alcohol
burn
on
the
way
down
and
lingering
brown
sugar
feel
is
surprisingly
light
with
medium
carbonation
and
a
bit
of
bite
this
is
a
great
one
it
is
not
overly
sweet
or
syrupy
nor
is
it
drowning
in
fruitiness
the
flavors
are
distinct
and
inviting
overall
i
would
put
this
with
the
big
3
abt
12
rochefort
10
and
westvleteren
12
poured
a
brownish
body
with
two
finger
tan
head
and
a
little
lace
the
aroma
is
a
good
mix
of
typical
belgian
yeast
and
orange
along
with
a
touch
of
sugar
and
and
breadiness
with
possible
caramel
and
breadiness
as
well
mediumbodied
with
a
very
slight
sticky
touch
the
beer
has
a
sharp
carbonation
and
peppery
spice
edge
that
adds
balance
and
gives
a
crisp
finish
vanilla
the
taste
is
moderately
sweet
with
some
candi
sugar
like
malt
along
with
toffee
or
caramel
or
bitter
cocoa
and
a
chewey
breadiness
as
well
as
having
some
fruit
flavors
beyond
citricorange
like
touches
of
dark
fruit
like
figs
or
black
cherry
a
textbook
quad
with
great
balance
and
a
mix
of
fruit
and
sweet
flavors
that
is
a
quality
example
of
the
style
that
hides
the
alcohol
well
to
be
sure
this
was
strong
but
it
didnt
taste
nearly
as
potent
as
it
felt
once
i
finished
this
off
a
while
after
undoing
the
top
of
the
330
ml
bottle
while
there
was
just
a
hint
of
vanilla
that
lingered
after
everything
else
slowly
faded
away
theres
so
much
to
like
here
that
any
quad
or
even
belgian
beer
fan
deserves
to
give
this
a
go
for
that
matter
this
isnt
something
to
be
downed
quickly
but
those
with
ample
time
will
be
well
rewarded
to
give
this
a
go
and
enjoy
it
for
all
its
worth
remarks
did
not
score
a
t
s
m
at
that
time
disregard
those
scores
overall
impression
a
very
strong
and
noticeably
alcoholic
quad
with
strong
flavors
of
dark
fruits
and
molasses
a
thick
and
sweet
beverage
this
beer
demands
to
be
enjoyed
over
a
long
period
of
time
othis
beer
is
not
for
the
timid
more
than
any
other
belgianstyle
beer
this
one
reminds
me
an
americanstyle
barrelaged
stout
the
chocolate
the
booze
and
the
heavy
feel
all
suggest
something
not
entirely
belgian
still
it
works
pretty
well
and
i
found
this
beer
to
be
an
enjoyable
way
to
end
an
evening
o
this
is
a
great
quad
there
is
the
nice
blend
of
yeasty
esters
with
a
good
sweetness
quality
and
alcohol
warmth
to
balance
all
blended
with
some
malt
character
nothing
is
out
of
balance
but
everything
has
its
place
delicious
pairings
extra
sharp
cheddar
hamburgers
tritip
and
smoked
fish
are
very
good
with
this
beer
dont
forget

this
is

absolutely
incredible

incredible
balance

complexity
of

and
very
smooth
to
sip
on
a
totally
world
class
offering
as
i
try
more
quads
i
suppose
i
may
find
one
i
like
better
but
i
tend
to
measure
all
beers
in
this
style
against
the
straffe
hendrik
as
i
probably
will
be
for
quite
some
time
i
cant
imagine
how
this
beer
could
be
improved
upon
overall
if
you
are
going
to
discuss
what
might
be
perceived
differences
between
a
quad
and
a
bds
this
might
be
the
one
to
point
to
if
someone
is
new
to
darker
brews
you
might
offer
them
this
as
a
small
aperitif
or
digestif
and
when
discussing
the
spectrum
of
quads
andor
bds
and
any
potential
differences
a
solid
offering
i
would
come
back
to
i
enjoy
drier
slightly
warming
booze
characteristics
mixed
in
with
a
hint
of
caramunich
the
only
reason
it
didnt
get
a
45
or
higher
from
me
but
that
is
my
personal
preference
overall
this
is
close
if
not
a
world
class
quad
lots
of
complexities
in
the
flavor
as
well
as
a
classic
look
and
feel
pours
a
gorgeous
burnt
sienna
into
my
ommengang
snifter
soft
white
head
that
lingers
up
and
down
the
glass
the
aroma
of
delicious
candy
sugar
fades
into
sugar
plums
and
mandrin
oranges
the
flavor
of
bready
caramel
malts
lingers
as
candied
fruit
wash
over
the
tongue
with
a
warming
brandy
quality
it
dances
over
the
tongue
and
makes
me
wish
for
more
o
nice
tasting
though
a
bit
boring
for
the
style
not
much
in
the
ester
category
overall
a
great
showcase
of
what
a
quad
can
be
could
use
some
adjustments
in
the
taste
department
but
its
still
an
elite
status
quad
overall
so
close
to
a
truly
elite
beer
maybe
it
is
unfair
to
this
beer
that
i
have
rochefort
10
and
8
very
readily
available
in
my
area
which
makes
my
standards
insanely
high
for
beers
of
this
essence
you
can
tell
the
craftsmanship
is
simply
not
there
with
this
beer
it
is
worth
the
extra
few
dollars
for
truly
world
class
products
m
smooth
and
dry
not
overly
carbonated
d
this
was
a
solid
quad
with
a
refined
scent
and
taste
and
great
body
the
finish
was
surprisingly
smooth
so
it
was
easy
to
drink
could
probably
improve
with
a
few
years
in
the
cellar
but
very
nice
fresh
not
the
top
of
this
style
but
still
fully
enjoyable
this
is
still
very
well
done
a
beer
i
will
buy
again
and
im
not
sure
why
i
waited
this
long
to
finally
try
it
drinkability
a
nice
beer
in
the
style
quadrupel
overall
one
of
the
best
ive
had
complex
just
the
one
almost
got
me
drunk

theres
a
good
reason
this

2
oz
cost
6
overall
a
solid
quad
very
enjoyable
o
saw
the
middling
reviews
before
i
had
this
and
i
imagine
there
is
some
issue
with
this
beer
not
quite
tasting
like
too
many
of
the
big
name
quads
but
it
is
a
very
pleasing
and
distincttasting
beer
i
would
easily
recommend
this
for
quad
and
bsda
fans
it
might
not
blow
you
away
for
the
style
but
taken
as
a
singular
beer
a
worthy
drink
indeed
overall
very
impressed
by
this
wellbalanced
quad
that
is
filled
with
both
complexity
and
restraint
overall
a
great
quad
good
stuff
drinkability
this
is
well
crafted
stuff
the
abv
is
much
too
high
for
quaffing
but
it
is
very
good
stuff
overall
a
very
nice
quad
i
enjoyed
it
more
then
some
of
the
bigger
names
beer
is
sweet
and
medium
in
body
nice
finish
mildly
bitter
a
little
roast
in
this
one
i
enjoyed
this
beer
a
lot
and
would
have
it
again
o
pick
this
up
if
you
are
a
quad
lover
well
done
poured
from
a
bomber
to
a
pint
glass
nice
head
doesnt
dissipate
with
a
nice
copper
color
smells
of
dark
fruit
and
heavy
malt
it
tastes
sweet
with
a
nice
dry
yet
tasty
finish
you
really
taste
the
malt
with
a
touch
of
raisins
and
dark
fruit
the
feel
is
smooth
and
perfectly
carbonated
overall
a
great
brew
with
lots
of
flavor
and
balance
i
will
for
sure
pick
this
up
again
looked
great
and
in
such
a
fine
bar
it
is
difficult
not
to
score
it
highly
but
im
being
objective
and
truthful
in
my
numbers
it
deserves
the
scores
its
getting
from
me

and
some
slight
spice
aromas
taste
is
much
the
same
with
a
mild
spice
bitterness
on
the
palate
with
each
sip
this
beer
has
a
good
level
of
carbonation
with
a
crisp
mouthfeel
overall
this
is
a
good
beer
that
is
tasty
and
easy
to
drink
o
straffe

is
a
fine
beer
and
excellent
example
of
the
authentic

wow
the

is
well
hidden

the

opaque

sticks
to
the
side
of
the

which
isnt
being
sipped
from
is
this
what
they
call
caramel
malts
ill
check
their
website
but
id
be
very
interested
in
the
other
beers
from
this
brewery
great
statrter
brew
for
the
evening
also
had
this
on
tap
at
theglobe
in
garden
grove
ca
and
wondering
if
i
should
be
there
drinking
this
instead
of
at
home
in
front
of
my
computer
a
nicely
made
rich
and
complex
beer
liquid
dark
bread
taste
is
heavy
on
the
caramel
malts
this
makes
the
beer
maltbitter
and
adds
a
currant
and
raisin
taste
bordering
my
threshold
for
the
maltbitterness
the
alcohol
is
well
hidden
11
alcohol
is
warm
but
it
is
not
sharp
the
beer
is
bitter
which
is
a
combination
of
the
malt
and
hop
bitterness
poured
into
my
ommegang
chalice
a
deep
roasted
chesnut
brown
with
a
sticky
one
finger
beige
head
atop
that
left
a
broken
ring
of
lace
as
it
settled
slowly
a
slight
sherry
vinegar
note
is
something
that
caught
my
attention
with
dark
brown
sugar
and
dark
fruit
in
there
as
wellthe
vinegar
element
is
something
i
have
never
come
across
in
a
quad
deep
brown
sugar
and
toffee
flavors
with
sweet
alcoholits
cakey
and
rich
with
a
slightly
acidic
finish
full
lush
feel
in
the
mouththis
is
somewhat
different
than
alot
of
quads
and
i
really
liked
itits
a
bit
raw
in
some
aspects
great
stuff
half
finger
head
on
a
hazy
deep
brown
body
excellent
lacing
simple
aroma
with
mostly
sweet
caramel
malts
and
some
herbal
notes
flavor
is
very
different
with
dark
candied
fruit
candy
sugar
toffee
caramel
and
a
mild
tartness
medium
body
and
lighter
side
of
moderate
carbonation
very
smooth
perfect
amount
of
sweetness
and
a
touch
boozy
but
for
11
percent
not
bad
at
all
overall
and
excellent
quad
took
me
to
a
sweet
caramellike
place
that
i
very
much
enjoyed
o
a
pretty
good
beer
c
a
pretty
solid
outing
for
a
quad
pretty
textbook
but
with
a
strong
taste
id
rank
it
in
the
top
10
of
quads
ive
tried
but
not
top
5
d
this
is
a
damn
fine
quad
with
more
hops
and
roasted
flavor
than
others
of
the
same
quality
ill
still
sweat
that
rochefort
and
la
trappe
but
this
one
is
a
banger
o
this
quad
was
a
very
good
interpretation
of
the
style
and
one
that
feels
a
bit
light
but
is
certainly
warming
and
satisfying
although
this
beer
doesnt
quite
reach
the
top
tier
of
trappist
quads
its
still
well
above
average
for
the
style
and
one
i
hope
to
find
and
enjoy
again
soon

if
im
going
to
drink
an
11
percent
abv
beer
i
like
to
at
least
get
some
flavor
enjoyment
out
of
it
this
quad
drinks
like
a
single
its
just
too
subtle
in
both
aroma
and
taste
not
undrinkable
but
id
definitely
never
shell
out
cash
for
another
bottle
overall
its
an
enjoyable
beer
its
balanced
but
it
could
be
more
polished
the
alcohol
detracts
definitely
a
sipper
the
tripel
was
a
good
one
and
now
the
quadrupel
is
a
good
one
thats
two
very
respectable
showing
from

got
closer

medium

tasty
and
complex
as
any
good
beer
from
the
style
very
nice
overall
a
nice
belgian
quad
pretty
standard
in
all
respects
but
the
standard
is
mighty
high
this
is
a
quality
beer
pours

with
a
touch
of
orange
in
the

small

fizzy

smells
like

sour

flavor
is
plenty
of
caramel

and
belgian
candy

even
some
raw

but
this
is
well
proportioned
not
rot
your

style
mouthfeel
is
nice
too
plenty
of
bright
carbonation
at
first
mellowing
as
it
warms
and
letting
the
strength
of
the
beer
come
though
great
finish
you
could
make
a
night
of
drinking
these
if
they
werent
so
expensive
glad
to
see
it
on
tap
at
the
cheeky
monk
downtown
denver
o
great
drinkability
an
excellent
quadrupel
flavors
work
well
in
concert
with
each
other
to
form
a
beer
thats
not
overly
heavy
and
quite
delicious
like
most
quads
for
me
its
a
warming
beer
that
seems
to
fit
as
a
dessert
after
a
meaty
meal
something
to
sip
slowly
and
really
enjoy
glad
i
picked
this
one
up
hoping
itll
make
an
appearance
at
the
next
belgian
beer
fest
i
hit
up
in
late
february
oi
love
quadsthis
one
is
a
large
step
below
st
bernardus
and
westy
versions
but
still
very
enjoyablemakes
a
great
nightcap
will
have
to
see
how
this
one
tastes
after
a
few
more
years
in
the
cellar
have
yet
to
taste
1
made
in
the
us
that
stacks
up
well
next
to
the
belgians
overall
good
beer
but
a
step
below
the
top
echelon
priced
fairly
well
o
a
tasteful
delight
always
nice
to
have
some
on
youre
shelf
overall
exceptional
beer
must
try
i
will
be
buying
this
again
particularly
if
i
can
find
cases
o
not
the
best
quad
that
ive
had
but
it
is
quite
drinkable
the
faintness
of
the
alcohol
makes
this
a
potentially
dangerous
beer
i
wish
there
was
more
on
the
aroma
but
the
flavor
more
than
makes
up
for
it
pours
an
amber
color
with
a
thick
two
finger
pillowy
head
which
gives
way
to
skim
and
leaves
nice
strand
of
lace
on
the
glass
the
aroma
is
of
dark
fruits
and
caramel
malts
the
aroma
is
slightly
faint
the
taste
has
a
caramel
malt
backbone
over
top
there
are
flavors
of
dark
fruits
there
is
also
a
slight
milk
chocolate
taste
along
with
brandy
like
flavors
at
the
end
there
is
a
very
slight
hop
bite
the
mouthfeel
is
moderatley
carbonated
overall
this
is
a
good
beer
the
aroma
was
a
little
faint
but
the
taste
was
good
and
complex
o
a
delicious
quad
i
would
definitely
drink
more
o
i
had
some
difficulty
rating
this
beer
because
its
so
hitormiss
for
me
on
the
one
hand
it
looks
great
and
tastes
great
while
on
the
other
its
smell
is
not
all
that
appealing
and
the
mouthfeel
is
a
little
too
boozy
for
my
liking
in
the
end
this
is
a
fairly
solid
quadruple
but
it
has
the
potential
to
be
so
much
more
a
good
sipper
not
as
complex
as
the
trappist
examples
of
the
style
still
an
enjoyable
beer
and
worth
a
try
o
it
is
growing
on
me
some
good
quad
aroma
and
flavors
nothing
that
really
stands
out
but
overall
this
is
well
done
pours
a
dark
brown
color

a
massive
three
finger
cocoa

sticks
around
for
about
10

held
up
to
the
light
the
nose
is
really
fantastic
raisin
apple

really
smooth

blended
extremely

no
hint
of
the
11
abv
taste
is
equally
as
impressive
with
toffee
caramel
and
a
touch
of
alcohol
burn
on
the
aftertaste
feel
is
medium
for
the
style
and
super
smooth
there
is
a
crisp
carbonated
aftertaste
as
well
i
really
liked
this
beer
lets
hope
the
11
abv
kills
my
cold
cheers
o
great
quadrupel
another
great
find
at
sycamore
final
notes
one
hell
of
a
beer
this
is
one
to
sip
on
in
front
of
a
fireplace
in
the
cold
weather
to
warm
up
would
also
make
a
great
afterdinner
beer
or
beer
to
pair
with
dessert
it
is
a
touch
dangerous
at
11
though
so
treat
it
with
respect
memorable
beer

a
nice

that
lasts
for
the
entire

is
rich
with
musty

with

an

and
therefore

pleasant
mouthfeel
that
hosts
a
range
of
flavors
from
cherry
to
black
tea
to
raisinbread
finish
has
some
of
that
musty
quality
and
more
raisins
this
is
a
really
well
done
quad
that
i
believe
would
hold
its
own
with
some
of
the
best
i
think
its
better
than
the
westy

my
buddy
shared
with
me
the
other
day
overall
a
great
quad
flavorwise
it
started
dry
right
off
subtle
choco
malts
with
light
sweetness
melded
with
dark
fruit
more
as
the
quad
warmed
had
no
real
bitterness
per
se
and
could
be
more
complex
but
it
was
still
damn
tasty

this
quad
tastes
awesome
it
has
perfect

and
the
11
percent
is
very
well
hidden
this
belgian
in
my
opinion
ranks
up
at
the
top
of
the
quads
im
very
surprised
at
earlier
reviews
as
i
will
definitely
seek
out
more
this
is
a
must
try
enjoy
a
good
solid
quad
pricey
at
9
but
worthy
overall
a
pretty
interesting
brew
if
i
have
it
again
im
going
to
have
to
remember
to
serve
it
a
little
warmer
than
i
did
o
an
ok
quad
the
booze
feels
disassociated
from
the
rest
of
the
profile
o
hard
to
find
ive
had
this
on
tap
and
now
bottle
and
i
believe
ill
get
it
every
time
i
see
it
this
is
a
bigass
belgian
that
hides
its
abv
very
well
balance
and
integrated
flavors
are
its
strengths
probably
worth
a
try
even
for
those
who
dont
love
belgian
styles

jd
delicious
and
tasty
quite
a
treat
the
strength
makes
it
a
sipper
the
mild
hint
of
hops
is
a
bit
different
than
other
less
hop
focused
quads
ive
had
which
gives
it
a
unique
characteristic
i
would
have
this
again
on
draft
at
brasserie
beck
in
dc
poured
into
a
tulip
glass
rich
and
intense
dark
belgian
ale
it
is
brewed
with
a
subtle
blend
of
specialty
malts
which
give
the
ale
an
extremely
dark
color
and
a
chewy
malty
complex
character
the
quadruple
combines
a
clean
dryness
with
a
warm
full
bodied
mouth
feel
and
essences
of
fruit
overall
a
very
nice
quad
be
warned
this
is
some
strong

this

im
excited
to

other

based
on
this
big

belgian
beauty
toasted

on

can
typically
handle
in
a

ale
like
this
but
im
a
sucker
for
well
balanced
big
ass
belgian
bier
mouthfeel
is
still
considered
a
bit
effervescent
even
with
loads
of
malts
it
doesnt
seem
the
least
bit
cloying
on
my
palate
which
is
an
amazing
feat
that
true
belgian
ales
always
seem
to
pull
off
with
ease
its
hard
to
believe
this
is
11
percent
abv
probably
more
hidden
booze
than
any
big
american
craft
brewer
will
offer
excecute
an
artform
the
label
states
this
is
bruges
last
standing
brasserie
or
at
least
one
of
them
mouthfeel
is
full
bodied
but
carried
so
well
with
some
lively
carbonation
its
pretty
amazing
overall
exomplexity
and
flavor
combined
this
is
one
of
the
better
quads
ive
had
in
some
time
a
different
style
than
my
normal
beer
consumption
is
really
a
welcomed
addition
and
revisit
to
beers
ive
tried
in
the
past
but
either
havent
had
access
to
or
just
havent
desired
since
ive
pretty
much
devoted
myself
to
craft
beer
typically
hoppier
offerings

dark
fruits
and
doughy

the
flavor
raisen

toasted
almond
and
caramel
smooth
on

and
the
alcohol
is
only
barely
noticeable
mouthfeel
is
medium
to
full
bodied
clean
enough
finish
and
semi
dry
at
that
overall
a
very
solid
quad
with
great
traditional
flavor
without
a
doubt
this
is
one
worth
revisiting
overall
this
is
solid
but
not
a
top
of
the
list
quad
it
almost
comes
closer
to
a
strong
ale
then
a
quad
the
dark
fruits
roasted
malts
it
would
be
hard
to
guess
this
as
a
quad
pretty
good
but
there
are
a
few
other
quads
that
smoke
this
beer
if
you
are
looking
for
a
different
twist
on
the
style
this
would
be
a
nice
sample
o
a
pretty
good
beer
not
my
favorite
example
of
the
style
mostly
held
back
by
the
dryness
of
the
flavor
but
really
not
bad
definitely
worth
a
try
poured
out
a
good
frothy
head
that
disapated
slowly
leaving
moderate
lacing
the
aroma
of
roasted
malts
and
dark
fruit
dominate
the
nose
peronally
i
like
this
one
altough
my
preference
leans
toward
strong
blonds
and
tripels
but
this
could
change
my
mind
on
that
alcohol
well
hidden
not
overly
sweet
high
carbonation
definitely
worth
a
try
i
bought
a
second
bottle
after
to
cellar
i
rather
like
this
brew
as
its
quite
unique
if
youre
expecting
the
big
dark
fruit
and
leather
thing
that
you
get
from

or

brews
you
will
be

this

finished
a

twangy

sugary
booze
thins
it
out
character
is
a
puzzle
od
not
a
big
fan
an
ok
quad
but
not
what
i
look
for
too
much
spice
and
yeast
and
i
could
never
have
a
full
bottle
of
this
o
as
referenced
earlier
this
beer
tastes
smells
and
feels
like
a
tripel
way
off
the
mark
for
the
style
and
not
great
regardless
of
style
consideration
not
my
favorite
belgian
quad
but
a
nice
break
from
the
rochefort
and
saint
bernardus
i
so
thoroughly
enjoy
the
lace
is
truly
spectacular
on
this
guy
the
alcolhol
is
well
hidden
and
overall
i
have
to
say
that
this
one
is
a
very
drinkable
quad
i
would
like
to
see
how
this
beer
is
when
you
age
it
a
few
years
it
can
only
get
better
its
a
good
drinkable
beer
the
11
is
not
a
big
problem
its
covered
well
enough
a
good
quad
overall
and
must
be
some
special
offer
since
i
didnt
even
see
this
at
the
brewery
overall
this
is
a
very
good
example
of
the
quad
style
while
it
is
not
my
favorite
it
is
a
good
one
indeed
if
you
like
quads
malts
or
just
good
beer
this
is
a
good
one
to
get
ahold
of
enjoyed

drinking
a
2011
vintage
one
of
my
regular
favorites
starts
out
a
but
sweet
then
turns
to
a
good
bite
of
alcohol
then
has
a
good
hop
balance
to
finish
nice
beer
drinkable
possibly
two
in
a
row
but
carefully
v
purchased
in
a
22oz
bomber
mediumhigh
value
this
has
a
dried
fruit
spicy
sugary
nose
with
a
hint
of
alcohol
the
beer
pours
brilliant
copper
to
ruby
tinted
amber
under
a

finely
moussey
bubbled
foam
collar
the
reverend
has
a
rich
creamy
palate
like
a
fruit
cake
soaked
in
alcohol
with
treacle
lightly
drizzled
on
top
filled
with
figs
dates
some
other
dried
fruit
and
maybe
a
couple
of
nuts
the
body
is
medium
to
a
little
above
which
is
much
less
than
all
the
flavor
would
lead
you
to
expect
the
carbonation
is
above
average
but
it
is
natural
and
very
fine
and
soft
there
is
some
alcohol
warming
but
it
is
hard
to
believe
that
this
is

when
drinking
it
ive
had
better
quads
before
o
i
had
fond
memories
of
this
beer
from
occasions
several
years
ago
it
would
appear
that
since
that
time
i
have
encountered
abt
12
rochefort
10
and
trois
pistoles
enough
that
this
beer
has
lost
some
of
that
initial
what
sorcery
is
this
quadrupel
you
speak
of
luster
its
not
bad
but
its
not
anything
i
would
seek
out
overall
i
like
this
a
lot
this
could
be
a
goto
belgian
in
ohio
its
about
7
for
a
bomber
a
very
good
value
yenamsain
pretty
nice
mellower
than
i
would
expect
and
there
could
be
a
little
bit
more
to
the
flavors
but
still
nice
4
overall
good
quad
complex
but
nothing
too
outthere
on
tap
at
yard
house
in
denver
a
beautiful
complex
beer
one
of
the
best
i
had
while
in
colorado
nice
beer
overall
this
definitely
covers
more
of
the
toffeebelgian
sugar
side
of
the
style
then
the
raisindark
fruit
of
most
quads
its
kind
of
like
a
quad
style
barleywine
its
good
but
nothing
mind
blowing
beer
is
smooth
and
tasty
almost
regal
excellent
with
almost
any
food
here
i
was
given
a
750
ml
bottle
of
the
reverend
for
my
birthday
by
a
good
friend
and
sadly
wasted
the
bottle
by
drinking
it
after
i
had
already
had
enough
scotch
to
dull
my
senses
deciding
to
give
it
a
fair
trial
i
picked
up
a
second
for
a
fairly
budget
price
6
50
and
decided
to
give
it
a
shot
the
aroma
was
a
little
bland
but
it
was
a
very
attractive
brew
once
i
poured
it
the
aroma
concealed
complex
and
rich
flavors
with
the
sweet
fruit
notes
complemented
well
by
just
a
touch
of
bitterness
each
of
the
first
few
sips
gave
me
new
subtleties
to
explore
and
i
found
myself
favorably
comparing
it
to
three
philosophers
and
gulden
draak
9000
two
other
favorites
of
mine
i
will
be
purchasing
a
great
deal
of
the
reverend
in
the
future
as
it
deeply
impressed
sweet
cherries
fig
raspberry
burnt
sugars
sweet
malty
boozyness
o
i
remember
liking
this
more
when
i
first
had
it
years
ago
now
i
find
it
to
be
decent
but
having
a
bit
too
much
alcohol
presence
all
the
right
flavors
are
there
but
theres
just
too
much
heat
maybe
some
aging
would
help
malty
nose
molasses
and
dried
fruit
on
palate
raisins
and
cherries
most
evident
minimal
head
and
lacing
seems
smoother
as
it
warms
but
abv
shows
its
presence
overall
drinkability
the
reverend
has
given
me
his
sermon
and
im
a
converted
believer
this
is
a
very
good
beer
deep
flavor
and
aroma
profiles
good
looking
and
even
the
mouthfeel
works
with
everything
else
going
on
id
hesitate
to
put
it
in
any
more
of
a
religious
connotation
but
i
effective
went
to
a
service
listened
to
the
sermon
took
communion
and
left
uplifted
this
is
one
damn
good
beer
the
alcohol
does
make
itself
a
little
bit
known
but
not
enough
that
i
found
it
hot
i
had
such
a
good
experience
i
know
its
dangerous
enough
for
me
to
reach
for
another
one
and
be
in
real
trouble
and
in
for
a
proper
preaching
against
sin
after
the
2nd
bottle
great
beer
and
ill
be
picking
this
up
again
its
a
nice
sipping
brew
im
very
impressed
with
this
beer
but
also
vexed
and
perplexed
this
is
a
stellar
americanbrewed
belgianstyle
ale
and
yet
it
seems
to
be
so
overlooked
could
it
be
because
it
isnt
from
belgium
or
because
its
so
commonly
available
in
any
case
i
now
revere
the
reverend
and
im
not
even
religious
overall
very
enjoyable
at
the
high
abv
definitely
not
a
session
beer
great
quad
that
is
only
hurt
by
its
excessive
sweetness
felt
like
a
rather
mild
quad
when
i
started
at
fridge
temp
but
as
the
time
went
on
and
the
beer
approached
room
temp
it
started
really
growing
on
me
and
becoming
so
much
more
complex
and
tasty
at
the
end
i
was
completely
enchanted
with
this
quad
so
yummy
hazy
dark
brown
color
half
finger
head
that
sticks
around
hops
lots
of
malt
and
alcohol
on
the
nose
amazing
smooth
malty
taste
malt
and
alcohol
overpowers
the
bitterness
but
not
in
a
way
that
it
is
unbalanced
im
a
huge
ipa
fan
but
this
is
one
of
the
best
beers
i
have
ever
had
aftertaste
leaves
a
strong
alcohol
burn
for
a
beer
hops
can
really
only
be
tasted
when
burping
excellent
beer
would
definitely
recommend
to
anyone
appearance
is
a
copper
color
with
golden
edges
there
was
a
half
finger
of
head
that
dissipated
quickly
the
nose
was
surprisingly
weak
the
flavor
profile
includes
the
classic
funky
belgian
yeast
flavor
the
finish
includes
a
slightly
intrusive
alcohol
burn
o
good
american
example
of
a
quad
not
nearly
the
best
quad
but
worth
a
try
may
have
again
good
beer
to
use
as
a
bridge
into
some
of
the
bigger
belgians
o
a
bit
boring
and
certainly
not
the
best
quad
but
worth
a
try
i
have
been
burned
at
homebrew
stuff
a
lot
lately
buy
at
your
own
risk
i
suggest
buying
only
stuff
you
know
is
fresh
o
not
bad
but
hardly
memorable
something
tells
something
may
have
been
off
here
it
was
a
bar
somewhat
reputable
for
its
quality
too
maybe
give
it
a
shot
from
a
bottle
sometime
overall
nice
smooth
big
beer
a
nice
example
of
a
beer
that
can
be
enjoyed
like
wine
not
a
bad
beer
but
not
worth
the
price
considering
the
other
a
quads
available
at
similar
pricing
the
10
abv
is
wellmasked
within
the
sweetness
of
the
belgian
candied
sugars
and
malts
but
in
all
instances
i
still
get
this
sort
of
wine
or
grape
character
which
i
find
brings
the
beer
down
a
notch
o
overall
not
bad
but
somewhat
disappointing
the
aromas
was
very
nice
but
the
palate
profile
feel
short
worth
a
try
but
there
are
so
many
great
quads
readily
available
that
i
dont
think
ill
be
purchasing
this
one
again
anytime
soon
o
as
a
different
take
on
the
classic
belgian
quad
i
enjoyed
this
quite
a
bit
and
would
recommend
it
for
those
looking
for
something
original
as
this
is
not
the
toffeedateprune
bomb
one
might
expect
all
around
pretty
darn
good
though
overy
complex
malt
and
spice
and
fruit
smell
make
this
a
great
beer
ultimately
this
is
a
good
beer
and
id
recommend
it
if
youre
looking
to
try
something
new
but
if
you
are
going
to
have
one
quad
this
year
this
beer
just
isnt
quite
it
an
agreeable
enough
newworld
ode
to
the
belgian
greats
of
the
style
the
booze
deftly
integrated
however
the
malt
just
seems
more
like
the
simple
country
cousin
rather
than
the
urbane
grand
uncle
of
the
family
glad
i
got
to
try
it
its
noted
here
to
remind
me
of
just
how
close
it
really
was
that
i
didnt
overall
a
good
american
quad
in
the
future
ill
stick
to
the
belgians
but
this
was
worth
a
try
othis
is
a
slightly
different
take
on
the
quad
it
lacks
the
raisinprunetobacco
flavors
well
it
might
have
a
little
tobacco
but
it
packs
a
big
alcoholic
punch
and
a
decent
toffeeforward
flavor
if
you
are
looking
to
replace
st
bernardus
abt
12
or
westy
look
elsewhere
but
if
you
want
something
to
pair
with
a
graham
cracker
crust
cheesecake
or
toffee
bread
pudding
this
is
a
solid
choice
overall
this
is
a
very
nice
quad
with
potent
flavors
that
are
for
the
most
part
nicely
balanced
the
heavy
alcohol
kick
is
a
bit
of
a
problem
and
the
beer
does
feel
like
it
needed
a
bit
more
of
a
bready
note
to
help
counter
the
sugars
but
for
the
most
part
this
is
excellent
fare
i
dont
know
why
but
i
feel
the
reverend
sounds
like
a
badass
blaxploitation
film
anyway
this
stuff
pours
a
dark
rubybrown
topped
by
a
finger
of
light
khaki
foam
the
nose
comprises
fig
chocolatecovered
pomegranate
stone
fruits
brown
sugar
nutmeg
light
candied
orange
peel
and
some
bready
yeast
in
the
background
the
taste
brings
in
more
of
the
same
with
the
fruits
and
spices
colliding
at
times
with
occasionally
untoward
results
in
addition
a
vein
of
booze
pokes
its
head
in
from
time
to
time
the
body
is
a
solid
medium
with
a
light
moderate
carbonation
and
a
slightly
pillowy
feel
overall
this
is
a
solid
quad
but
one
that
doesnt
quite
balance
the
flavors
completely
still
its
definitely
worth
a
shot
im
still
rather
new
to
quads
but
this
one
seemed
to
be
a
bit
below
average
it
did
get
better
as
it
went
down
overall
a
good
example
of
an
american
born
quad
o
worth
trying
and
a
good
domestic
quad
that
is
perfect
for
after
a
meal
pours
a
dark
amberred
one
solid
finger
of
off
white
somewhat
dark
head
lots
of
stickage
on
the
glass
excellent
head
retention
especially
for
the
alcohol
content
smell
of
grapes
alcohol
raisins
cranberries
and
toffee
permeate
the
aroma
of
this
beer
taste
is
quite
complex
beer
tastes
of
toffee
sweet
malts
caramel
and
fruits
finishes
strongly
with
a
raisiny
fruity
flavor
only
a
hint
of
alcohol
is
present
and
does
not
interfere
with
the
flavors
of
the
beer
overall
think
this
one
peaked
but
i
like
the
way
this
came
out
mellow
and
easy
drinking
this
was
a
cellar
treat
you
can
take
your
time
when
deciding
to
crack
this
one
still
very
tasty
httpwww
facebook
comkajiisbeerreviews
overall
what
we
enjoyed
most
about
this
brew
was
the
massive
inclusion
of
sweet
bready
banana
esters
these
dominated
the
aroma
likely
to
hide
the
booze
but
did
mix
well
with
the
otherwise
hearty
malt
base
phenols
vanillas
and
spice
the
flavor
followed
in
the
same
vein
but
let
through
a
bit
more
of
that
aromatic
bitterness
than
sweetness
while
this
guy
certainly
preaches
on
the
sweet
side
he
remains
reasonable
and
always
palpable
for
such
a
robust
style
o
its
worth
a
try
and
if
i
ever
go
to
boulder
colorado
i
would
try
it
again
drinks
smooth
i
like
it
tastes
good
even
though
this
seems
to
deviate
from
the
traditional
quad
its
tasty
and
enjoyable
this
is
a
decent
beer
the
alcohol
is
noticeable
but
thats
fine
for
the
style
the
flavor
and
body
are
not
nearly
as
full
as
i
would
have
liked
there
are
some
nice
esters
that
come
through
that
are
pleasant
but
the
big
maltiness
that
i
would
expect
from
a
quad
is
missing
the
thinness
of
the
body
also
allows
the
booze
to
come
through
more
than
i
would
probably
prefer
overall
this
is
a
nice
beer
but
certainly
not
a
quad
i
would
return
to
the
nineteen
tripel
from
avery
suffers
the
same
spice
problem
and
was
even
more
undrinkable
however
my
friend
who
is
not
a
big
beer
drinker
although
she
has
begun
to
like
some
craft
beers
and
i
begin
to
find
our
tastes
are
opposed
absolutely
loved
both
i
absolutely
love
averys
czar
ris
ive
yet
to
see
an
american
take
on
a
trappist
which
was
worth
drinking
although
ive
had
only
three
the
aforementioned
two
and
brother
thelonious
which
has
an
awesome
label
but
i
am
not
sure
i
want
a
whole
bomber
once
again
i
am
reminded
that
davequadmeh
that
said
if
i
see
any
of
these
on
the
shelf
i
may
grab
one
for
cellaring
i
have
known
a
quad
or
two
that
got
better
over
time
and
this
one
has
promise
overall
a
very
good
american
take
on
a
belgian
quad
has
all
the
malty
dark
fruit
taste
you
look
for
in
the
style
o
this
is
a
good
quad
looks
nice
and
has
a
good
feel
to
it
i
like
the
smell
of
cherries
too
pours
a
beautiful
clear
dark
red
but
without
much
head
aroma
of
cherries
raisin
candy
sugar
very
very
sweet
smelling
lighter
mouthfeel
than
expected
and
very
smooth
sweet
flavor
with
cherry
and
maybe
a
bit
of
banana
slight
alcohol
warmth
bur
hides
it
nicely
this
is
a
bit
one
dimensional
and
doesnt
really
touch
thr
complexities
i
come
to
expect
from
a
quad
almost
like
a
very
sweet
and
heavy
dubbel
not
a
bad
beer
but
there
are
better
examples
o
very
enjoyable
and
rather
easy
drinking
quad
with
wellhidden
abv
o
best
quad
ive
ever
had
wasnt
like
any
other
o
very
enjoyable
but
definitely
a
sipper
this
style
tends
to
be
a
little
sweet
for
me
as
is
this
beer
but
i
will
enjoy
polishing
off
the
rest
of
my
beer
all
in
all
this
isnt
a
bad
beer
but
it
is
far
from
an
impressive
quad
while
ill
certainly
finish
the
bottle
this
is
a
good
reason
to
stick
with
the
tried
and
true
o
a
very
solid
beer
not
quite
up
to
par
with
belgian
quads
but
i
would
drink
again
might
like
to
try
this
one
if
on
tap
sometime
will
buy
again
o
overall
a
nice
quad
some
nice
fruit
especially
in
the
nose
and
pretty
easy
to
drink
for
10
abv
would
have
it
again
overall
this
is
a
fine
respectable
american
take
at
the
style
but
comes
up
a
bit
short
when
stacked
against
the
superior
belgian
examples
a
bit
light
in
the
darker
caramelized
maltiness
which
allows
much
stone
fruit
esters
to
come
through
for
the
availability
factor
alone
it
is
worth
a
go
served
from
a
bottle
not
much
head
good
lacing
though
cloudy
dark
amber
beer
smells
great
nice
mouthful
just
for
me
the
taste
wasnt
there
not
really
bad
its
drinkable
just
not
a
beer
i
would
ever
buy
again
if
given
the
choice
of
others
the
price
wasnt
too
bad
just
not
one
of
my
favorites
overall
a
very
nice
american
quad
it
has
a
nice
fruity
flavor
mixed
with
a
great
feel
and
a
very
nice
warming
taste
tasty
and
well
worth
a
try
overall
i
am
very
happy
that
i
took
the
time
to
review
this
beer
it
is
something
i
have
enjoyed
in
the
past
but
never
really
focused
on
and
i
think
it
goes
underappreciated
as
one
of
averys
stronger
efforts
i
look
forward
to
experiencing
this
one
again
in
the
very
near
future
overall
not
really
the
best
beer
i
picked
up
from
avery
but
its
not
a
bad
take
on
the
style
i
would
much
rather
have
a
hog
heaven
pours
a
deep
dark
maple
syrupcolored
amber
hardly
any
head
at
all
even
after
a
fairly
aggresive
hard
pour
the
litttle
head
there
is
disappears
in
seconds
and
leaves
a
very
faint
foam
ring
obviously
no
lacing
faint
aroma
of
candi
sugar
raisins
fig
and
spice
on
the
nose
accents
of
all
of
the
aspects
mentioned
as
part
of
the
nose
present
in
the
taste
plus
some
biscuit
and
very
distinguishable
alcohol
absolutely
no
depth
to
the
taste
at
all
somewhat
bland
overall
im
not
a
big
fan
there
was
no
head
and
a
barely
above
average
mouthfeel
one
of
the
least
complex
quads
ive
had
i
have
really
enjoyed
what
avery
has
to
offer
however
ill
pass
on
the
reverend
in
the
future
dark
reddish
orange
pour
with
a
beige
head
smells
candied
sweet
with
banana
plums
floral
and
cloves
taste
is
not
as
sweet
as
the
smell
suggests
although
still
quite
sweet
there
are
turns
of
raisin
currants
cherries
and
clovespice
notes
that
try
to
keep
some
order
to
the
candy
sweet
and
malt
base
seems
better
on
draft
than
from
what
i
remember
from
a
bottle
the
beer
pours
a
medium
brown
color
with
red
hues
and
a
thin
off
white
head
that
quickly
faded
smells
of
raisin
clove
and
candisugar
with
a
hint
of
banana
very
aromatic
tastes
warm
and
alcoholic
with
some
dark
fruits
banana
and
clove
the
feel
is
nice
and
thick
with
low
carbonation
and
a
strong
finish
this
is
a
strong
quad
a
little
age
would
probably
do
it
some
good
i
would
drink
this
again
but
wouldnt
buy
a
bottle
without
putting
it
away
for
at
least
a
year
o
good
flavors
and
some
nice
complexity
pretty
good
but
there
are
some
better
beers
for
the
style
that
being
said
the
reverend
proved
to
be
a
very
intriguing
mix
of
spice
and
flavor
that
i
would
not
normally
expect
from
a
quad
despite
the
huge
nose
this
beer
possesses
the
consistency
was
a
little
to
thin
and
thus
the
alcohol
does
mask
some
of
the
flavors
that
the
drinker
knows
is
there
but
simply
cannot
get
enough
out
of
them
to
identify
upon
drinking
the
ale
however
the
deep
fruits
meld
nicely
with
the
alcohol
and
the
drinker
is
left
with
an
interesting
earth
aftertaste
that
i
have
never
seen
in
a
quad
the
problem
however
is
it
is
almost
too
earthy
as
you
soon
forget
the
first
notes
of
the
beer
leaving
you
with
a
dry
bitterness
that
if
eased
up
on
would
be
rather
nice
but
sadly
it
was
a
hint
too
much
interesting
nonetheless
pours
a
clear
dark
copperorange
with
a
foamy
beige
head
that
settles
to
an
oily
film
on
top
of
the
beer
small
dots
of
lace
form
around
the
glass
on
the
drink
down
smell
is
of
malt
brown
sugar
dark
fruits
yeast
and
some
spice
aromas
taste
is
much
the
same
with
a
mild
spice
finish
and
a
slight
alcohol
kick
with
each
sip
this
beer
has
a
good
level
of
carbonation
with
a
crisp
mouthfeel
overall
this
is
a
pretty
good
beer
that
smells
better
than
it
tastes
in
my
opinion
overall
i
expected
more
taste
from
a
quadrupel
it
is
possible
my
bottle
was
bad
but
for
the
price
i
expected
more
this
beer
does
not
seem
like
a
quadruple
i
thought
it
was
more
like
a
strong
dark
ale
the
color
and
appearance
is
the
main
reason
for
this
opinion
the
smell
is
characteristic
of
a
quadruple
and
it
was
enjoyable
the
taste
was
also
pleasant
its
not
the
best
quadruple
that
i
have
had
but
avery
makes
a
good
product
o
excellent
beer
love
the
subdued
alcohol
in
this
one
very
dangerous
sip
this
one
carefully
or
you
may
end
up
in
the
drunk
tank
i
reserve
most
of
my
top
overall
ratings
in
the
style
for
true
belgians
as
they
tend
to
be
the
most
complex
in
taste
and
aroma
and
always
have
great
creamy
mouthfeel
but
the
reverend
has
captivated
me
a
delicious
beer
with
impeccable
feel
and
all
the
elements
worthy
of
the
prestige
of
imbibing
from
my
westy
chalice
great
beer
and
a
great
value
will
definitely
come
back
to
it
the
masters
have
this
one
beat
in
the
feel
sometimes
in
an
effort
to
get
that
rich
full
creaminess
and
strength
without
the
heaviness
a
beer
goes
toward
being
overly
carbonated
and
crisp
enough
just
to
fill
almost
like
facsimilating
a
creaminess
this
beer
tends
that
way
it
could
also
use
more
heft
for
a
quad
overall
a
pretty
good
quad
not
in
the
same
league
as
the
style
leaders
but
a
worthy
effort
after
having
my
second
one
of
these
i
think
even
more
highly
of
it
its
the
cheapest
quad
ive
come
across
and
still
the
best
so
far
the
flavour
is
so
complex
and
very
conservative
on
hop
use
allowing
me
to
really
pick
up
on
the
whole
range
of
the
palate
this
is
possibly
the
best
beer
ive
ever
had
so
possibly
also
the
best
for
the
money
since
its
almost
affordable
for
a
quad
some
of
the
better
budget
beers
can
still
compete
though
since
theyre
so
cheap
but
this
is
definitely
up
there
in
the
top
5
best
beers
for
the
money
its
amazingly
delicious
i
didnt
think
i
was
into
yeasty
beers
and
this
little
gem
proved
me
wrong

very
goodbetter

originally

disappointed
in
this
one
i
know
the
raisins
are
a
personal
problem
but
theres
not
much
to
set
them
off
against
submediocre
4
0
d
more
and
more
i
think
that
the
general
quad
should
be
split
into
belgian
and
american
quads
this
is
very
tasty
but
it
doesnt
taste
all
that
much
like
the
famous
trappist
quads
out
there
super
tasty
beer
that
is
fruit
centric
and
vivid
poured
out
a
clear
garnet
color
with
orange
highlights
around
the
edges
and
only
a
thin
collar
for
a
head
no
lacing
peaches
and
cream
aroma
combined
with
lesser
amounts
of
raspberries
and
plums
has
a
pretty
low
phenol
level
for
a
quad
im
impressed
tastes
of
creme
brulee
and
brown
sugar
but
not
very
yeasty
in
comparison
to
other
quads
further
light
flavors
of
nutmeg
spice
and
some
herbal
aroma
hopping
appear
around
the
edges
of
the
beer
as
it
warms
up
in
my
opinion
it
could
have
used
about
12
heavier
noble
spice
bittering
for
optimal
balance
against
the
sweetness
but
ymmv
as
that
sort
of
thing
is
highly
subjective
medium
bodied
and
lightly
carbonation
lightly

a

in

that
stays
with

more
than
a
hint
of

syrup
dries
out
as
you
sip
not
one
of
the
better
examples
of
the
style
in
my
opinion
o
a
nice
take
on
the
quad
style
i
enjoyed
this
but
was
expecting
a
little
thicker
heavier
sweeter
type
beer
like
most
quads
ive
come
to
enjoy
i
would
still
have
this
again
anytime
soon
overall
the
beer
is
underwhelming
it
is
very
sweet
and
not
balanced
enough
it
does
display
the
toffee
and
caramel
flavors
well
though
pretty
true
to
style
with
dashes
of
things
that
can
be
improved
upon
slightly
very
good
though
for
an
american
quad
and
on
of
the
better
american
quads
ive
had
this
beer
is
just
a
touch
too
sweet
and
isnt
nearly
complex
but
is
beginner
friendly
if
a
quad
could
ever
be
pretty
spot
on
though
avery
should
be
proud
overall
an
enjoyable
quad
nothing
out
of
the
ordinary
but
i
wouldnt
refuse
a
second
glass
if
it
was
being
offered
the
alcohol
sneaks
up
on
you
after
the
full
22
oz
bottle
i
wouldnt
go
for
too
many
in
one
sitting
would
like
to
try
on
draft
overall
its
a
very
solid
quad
lacked
a
bit
on
the
nose
but
made
up
for
it
in
the
taste
if
you
like
belgian
ales
acquire
a
bottle
overall
a
worthy
experience
this
beer
is
another
great
one
representative
of
its
style
4
overall
glory
be
the
light
and
mine
eyes
are
open
to
the
golden
way
this
is
one
awe
inspiring
beer
that
im
glad
that
had
rested
in
the
belly
of
this
beast
amen
my
brothers
sisters
amen
o
a
nice
quad
it
differs
from
most
in
that
it
is
a
very
sessionable
quad
which
is
rare
dangerous
in
the
fact
that
you
dont
get
the
big
alcohol
flavor
and
burn
with
the
bold
raisin
and
dark
fruit
you
could
drink
this
all
night
but
you
probably
wouldnt
make
it
too
long
avery
the
reverend
quad
this
brew
is
like
mixing
34
of
a
double
with
of
a
triple
does
that
add
up
to
a
quad
the
body
has
a
mahogany
color
and
while
pretty
dark
you
can
see
through
it
not
much
of
a
head
forms
and
that
which
floats
to
the
surface
is
off
white
what
comes
in
the
way
of
aroma
is
a
mellow
mix
of
malt
and
hops
this
is
the
first
quad
i
have
tasted
so
i
was
not
sure
of
what
to
expect
the
reverend
comes
across
as
a
very
good
double
to
me
with
the
sweet
malt
and
roasted
caramel
flavors
tempered
with
a
belgian
yeasty
and
bready
notes
along
with
hints
of
piney
hops
very
good
m
sweet
and
wet
with
an
intense
warming
im
guessing
caused
by
the
generous
alcohol
content
this
is
a
strong
beer
that
can
quitely
defeat
you
a
very
well
done
and
worthy
beer
enjoy
slowly
o
a
sipper
every
sip
is
like
heaven
rich
finish
o
slightly
disappointed
the
flavors
didnt
really
stand
out
for
me
here
pours
brown
kinda
opaqueish
with
a
nice
off
white
head
sweet
aroma
of
caramelized
brown
sugar
molasses
raisins
figs
cherries
and
a
touch
of
alcohol
very
sweet
flavor
belgian
yeast
is
there
with
some
brown
sugar
raisin
fig
molasses
and
some
alcohol
medium
body
to
this
overall
its
good
but
just
too
sweet
for
me
personally
i
will
have
to
try
this
again
on
tap
and
see
if
i
can
enjoy
it
more
when
i
dont
have
to
drink
a
full
bombers
worth
in
one
sitting
i
definitely
noticed
my
opinion
of
this
was
stronger
at
the
start
than
it
was
at
the
end
when
the
sweetness
had
just
become
too
much
for
me
o
not
my
favorite
dictator
beer
but
a
respectable
quad
avery
has
a
great
lineup
and
this
flavorful
brew
just
adds
to
this
brewerys
legacy
id
be
excited
to
try
any
of
their
other
belgian
offerings
anyway
cheers
full
bodied
with
modest
carbonation
and
a
sweet
aftertaste
unfortunately
there
is
not
a
lot
to
like
about
this
beer
i
will
pass
on
it
in
the
future
creamy
just
a
tad
bite
of
coffee
bite
low
bitterness
alcohol
is
just
insanely
well
blended
o
overall
i
thought
it
was
a
very
good
quad
it
does
an
amazing
job
of
hiding
the
alcohol
the
body
feels
a
little
light
and
there
is
some
bite
in
the
carbonation
but
its
still
a
really
good
beer
i
would
drink
it
again
i
would
recommend
it
so
easy
to
drink
and
so
delicious
the
wellstocked
bottle
shop
down
the
street
has
had
this
many
a
time
and
i
have
bought
bottles
numerous
times
in
addition
to
having
it
on
tap
this
has
got
to
be
one
of
the
best
of
its
kind
that
is
readily
available
na
zdravje
how
it
ages
this
beer
beer
masks
the
10
abv
well
goes
down
better
than
almost
any
quad
ive
had
truly
the
best
american
made
quad
ive
ever
had
while
certainly
not
my
favorite
beverage
made
by
avery
it
is
interesting
and
worth
a
try
for
those
interested
dr
quite
drinkable
for
the
abv
i
enjoy
it
and
would
have
it
again
preferably
aged
hides
its
abv
well
poured
from
a
22
oz
bottle
into
a
wide
mouthed
wine
glass
pours
a
rubybrown
color
with
little
bubbles
coming
up
continuously
this
brew
has
very
little
head
but
pretty
good
retention
with
a
little
lacing
good
to
know
there
are
still
active
yeasts
in
there
speaking
of
yeast
it
smells
quite
strongly
of
belgian
yeast
and
also
of
malt
has
an
earthy
quality
to
it
but
crisp
the
taste
is
fullbodied
and
clean
has
the
same
yeasty
and
malty
qualities
as
the
smell
with
a
little
carbonation
to
keep
it
refreshing
the
10
percent
abv
is
noticeable
but
more
of
a
sweet
sensation
there
is
nothing
overpowering
about
the
reverend
everything
is
well
balanced
that
being
said
maybe
i
would
like
a
little
more
excitement
from
a
quadrupel
boulevards
the
sixth
glass
is
my
favorite
but
this
one
holds
up
to
the
best
of
them
2
5
finger
frothy
head
with
some
lacing
clear
red
tinged
amber
body
strong
fig
and
mild
dark
fruit
aroma
with
a
hint
of
spice
and
colalike
flavor
is
syrupy
with
mostly
dark
fruit
and
candy
like
moderate
carbonation
and
medium
to
full
body
overall
this
is
a
mild
quad
its
not
quite
as
bold
as
the
belgian
brewery
versions
but
still
a
nice
drinkable
quad
doa
the
reverend
pours
a
deep
ruby
color
more
transluscent
than
expected
almost
like
a
sherry
the
initial
head
was
fairly
frothy
for
a
quad
but
receded
fairly
quickly
as
others
have
noted
the
aromas
were
of
banana
and
cloves
however
not
very
aromatic
in
my
opinion
the
taste
was
some
more
of
the
banana
spice
along
with
hints
of
fruity
sweetness
alcohol
and
belgian
yeast
imprints
the
mouthfeel
was
nice
a
bit
dry
nice
carb
and
solid
body
overall
for
me
this
is
not
a
standout
brew
from
avery
which
has
a
lot
of
quality
in
its
catalogue
for
a
quadrupel
i
would
take
weyerbacher
quad
every
time
its
damn
good
beer
cheers
to
all
and
enjoy
overall
i
thought
that
this
was
a
pretty
solid
and
good
quad
it
went
down
smooth
had
no
off
flavors
and
it
didnt
taste
boozy
at
all
but
it
just
wasnt
as
complex
and
flavorful
as
some
of
the
better
quads
so
i
cant
say
that
this
is
a
top
tier
quad
this
beer
is
dangerously
drinkable
it
goes
down
super
smooth
with
hardly
any
trace
of
its
10
i
would
have
no
problem
drinking
the
whole
bottle
this
is
the
smoothest
most
easy
drinking
quad
i
have
ever
had
what
i
liked
most
about
this
beer
was
the
mouthfeel
and
the
drinkability
the
mouthfeel
was
pretty
good
for
a
quad
with
just
the
right
amount
of
carbonation
and
the
drinkability
was
about
as
good
as
it
gets
for
a
quad
it
was
also
a
pretty
good
value
what
i
liked
least
about
this
beer
was
that
it
was
lacikng
some
bolder
flavors
and
wasnt
as
caramely
as
the
aroma
lead
me
to
believe
i
would
have
also
liked
a
little
more
complexity
i
would
buy
this
beer
again
when
looking
for
a
good
easy
drinking
quad
plus
the
price
makes
this
a
pretty
good
value
compared
to
what
some
of
the
more
traditional
quads
cost
and
i
am
always
looking
for
a
good
value
when
it
comes
to
craft
beer
i
would
recommend
giving
this
a
try
if
you
like
quads
this
would
also
make
a
good
introduction
to
the
style
avery
comes
through
with
another
solid
beer
and
the
best
of
their
big
beers
that
i
have
tried
so
far
they
really
made
one
drinkable
quad
but
in
the
end
it
lacked
that
special
something
with
the
flavor
to
put
it
on
the
top
level
good
job
avery
you
can
be
sure
that
i
will
be
on
the
look
out
for
more
of
your
beers
the
lost
fugawi
is
still
my
favorite
quad
pours
a
murky
ruby
color
with
a
nice
frothy
head
that
fades
fairly
quickly
lovely
lacing
smells
sweet
dark
fruits
some
banana
taste
starts
very
sugary
dark
fruits
theres
a
spicyness
present
and
slight
banana
this
is
a
ok
attempt
at
a
quad
not
anything
special
but
good
d
i
havent
had
too
many
quads
but
this
one
certainly
is
a
great
beer
in
my
book
relatively
affordable
in
co
well
constructed
and
doesnt
drink
like
a
high
abv
beer
this
ale
had
an
agreeable
smell
and
taste
for
me
cant
really
be
more
specific
as
i
am
a
real
novice
grew
up
on
coors
and
bud
now
in
my
60s
and
enjoying
craft
beers
o
overall
a
nice
quad
some
nice
fruit
especially
in
the
nose
and
pretty
easy
to
drink
for
10
abv
would
have
it
again
reddishorange
bodied
brew
topped
by
a
single
fingered
creamy
white
head
the
exhibited
decent
retention
and
solid
lacing
i
smelled
toffee
malts
backed
by
a
solid
hop
profile
with
a
slight
burn
from
the
booze
the
taste
was
similar
to
the
nose
although
the
hops
back
off
as
the
raisons
become
more
prominent
aftertaste
consisted
of
sweet
malty
booze
with
earthy
grassy
undertones
mouthfeel
was
medium
bodied
well
carbonated
brew
that
remains
creamy
overall
a
pretty
darn
tasty
brew
this
smells
and
drinks
a
lot
like
a
barley
wine
the
finish
wasnt
spectacular
and
it
didnt
really
fit
into
the
style
o
almost
as
good
as
st
bernardus
abt
12
would
be
happy
to
enjoy
this
from
november
through
february
great
job
avery
o
a
good
belgian
quad
but
too
sweet
for
my
preferences
overy
enjoyable
and
with
the
plentiful
abv
this
one
will
surely
provide
some
fun
o
enjoyable
brew
smooth
taste
and
fine
scent
gives
a
great
experience
the
more
avery
brews
i
try
the
more
i
love
them
o
like
it
quite
a
bit
it
goes
well
with
the
style
its
really
enjoyable
warm
beer
would
enjoy
it
a
lot
more
often
if
i
could
get
it
easily
on
my
area
it
could
mature
pretty
well
a
good
brew
the
sixth
glass
that
is
a
delight
of
the
smokestack
series
that
i
strongly
suggest
this
is
a
medium
to
full
bodied
brew
with
a
modest
level
of
carbonation
it
is
smooth
in
the
feel
with
a
pleasant
warming
aspect
for
10
abv
overall
this
was
nicely
done
i
could
see
it
getting
even
better
if
given
some
time
to
age
and
mellow
worth
giving
a
try
this
was
not
nearly
as
good
in
a
bottle
when
i
tried
it
again
later
review
to
put
it
short
and
to
the
point
like
my
friend
marcus
andersson
this
is
a
complex
beer
for
a
simple
man
look
what
it
did
to
the
poor
guy
yes
its
him
behind
the
bottle
bomber
split
with
my
roommate
pours
a
light
candy
brown
good
looking
white
cream
head
that
tracks
lacing
booze
legs
yup
candy
sweet
caramel
funk
in
the
nose
followed
by
a
grain
heavy
and
super
sweet
tongue
raisins
brown
sugar
plum
rum
sour
apple
toffee
with
a
strong
booze
presence
yet
solid
full
bodied
mouth
on
it
solid
brew
in
my
opinion
for
the
style
is
pretty
damn
good
definitely
recommended
medium
bodied
with
good
complexity
and
balance
very
drinkable
especially
for
10
be
careful
this
poured
out
as
a
lightly
hazy
brownish
amber
color
with
a
cream
colored
head
on
top
the
head
sticks
around
for
a
little
while
but
does
fade
with
time
and
leaves
just
a
bit
of
lacing
the
smell
of
the
beer
was
sweet
a
little
boozy
and
has
some
yeasty
bread
aromas
coming
off
of
it
the
taste
of
the
beer
was
also
a
little
sweet
upfront
with
some
fermented
dark
fruit
flavors
with
some
boozy
heat
in
there
also
the
mouthfeel
of
the
beer
was
smooth
and
had
a
good
carbonation
to
it
overall
i
found
this
to
be
a
pretty
good
quad
but
not
my
favorite
overall
a
good
almost
average
quad
in
many
ways
but
there
is
some
smell
that
seems
to
affect
the
taste
in
subtle
ways
overall
great
beer
o
blah
this
beer
is
ok
probably
wouldnt
buy
it
again
i
dont
know
if
i
am
really
a
big
fan
of
belgians
so
this
beer
may
actually
be
good
for
this
style
i
just
havent
tried
enough
to
compare
it
to
overall
the
reverend
is
not
a
bad
beer
at
all
it
just
doesnt
fit
into
a
flavor
profile
that
i
like
this
is
one
of
the
better
quads
that
i
have
had
lacy
head
with
a
clear
amberred
fluid
very
inviting
very
complex
really
nice
and
rich
texture
of
sweet
malts
followed
up
with
some
fruitiness
on
the
finish
high
alcohol
doesnt
warm
just
hits
your
head
on
an
empty
stomach
nice
clean
tongue
numb
really
good
this
is
an
extraordinarily
complex
quad
it
is
smooth
and
rich
and
bright
and
drinkable
pours
an
almost
nutbrown
shade
of
red
and
smells
immediately
of
alchohol
and
yeast
caramel
notes
in
the
nose
as
well
first
sip
is
wow
very
well
balanced
for
a
beer
of
this
abv
as
it
warms
the
alcohol
comes
to
the
fore
even
moreso
making
the
witty
commentary
on
the
label
ring
particularly
true
it
paired
perfectly
with
a
crumly
aged
english
cheddar
cheese
and
toasted
flax
baguette
i
will
absolutely
be
buying
more
of
this
fine
ale
overall
i
found
the
beer
to
be
too
sweet
and
fruity
with
not
enough
balance
from
the
other
components
to
pull
off
the
sweetness
it
wasnt
cloying
but
it
wasnt
complex
either
in
addition
the
aroma
of
rust
and
possible
taste
of
iron
turned
this
into
one
of
the
worst
quads
ive
had
its
possibly
i
had
a
bad
bottle
but
im
hesitant
to
spring
for
another
bomber
to
find
out
o
really
enjoyed
this
one
smoothness
stands
out
on
averys
interpretation
of
a
quad
not
one
of
my
favorites
but
a
solid
beer
nonetheless
great
pickup
at
the
grocery
store
for
the
price
a
very
drinkable
beer
but
not
incredible
by
any
means
just
well
done
not
exceptional
doesnt
impress
or
excite
at
all
but
good
anywhere
anytime
22
oz
poured
into
a
snifter
huge
dark
body
with
a
slight
head
massive
alcohol
and
malt
character
some
yeast
funk
not
quite
enough
reasonably
drinkable
they
didnt
nail
it
but
its
not
bad
either
pretty
good
price
too
definitely
cheaper
than
a
real
belgian
quad
served
ontap
in
a
goblet
the
reverend
is
dark
copper
in
color
with
a
head
that
faded
quickly
and
left
a
thin
sheath
of
foam
on
the
surface
the
smell
was
very
yeasty
and
strong
in
dark
fruits
such
as
raisins
or
plums
it
was
exorbitantly
sweet
probably
the
sweetest
beer
ive
had
to
this
point
complete
with
dark
fruit
and
clove
flavors
so
strong
that
at
times
i
felt
as
though
i
was
drinking
liquid
juicy
fruit
feels
very
thick
and
warm
and
smooth
in
the
mouth
and
the
carbonation
doesnt
bite
much
overall
a
solid
quad
but
one
i
wouldnt
pair
with
a
cajun
crawfish
pizza
again
overall
its
decent
but
no
way
can
compair
to
something
like
rochefort
10
as
fair
as
complex
flavors
and
smoothness
lacks
the
spices
and
balance
of
hops
and
malts
to
set
it
apart
from
the
rest
not
bad
but
had
alot
better
this
is
a
delicious
beer
and
i
am
sad
that
arizona
wont
be
carrying
avery
for
a
long
while
interesting
beer
that
is
surely
worth
a
visit
overall
good
beer
just
not
a
great
match
for
the
style
in
my
opinion
maybe
i
just
drink
to
many
trappists
beers
but
i
would
still
recommend
giving
this
beer
a
try
o
when
you
first
sip
this
it
tastes
like
legitimate
quad
except
the
carbonation
seems
to
fizzy
for
the
style
but
the
flavor
never
develops
quads
should
unfold
their
many
layers
this
hits
you
with
the
same
surface
flavors
over
and
over
again
it
was
a
chore
to
finish
the
final
quarter
glass
of
the
selection
from
avery
ive
tried
this
is
the
only
one
that
i
dont
like
a
lot
d
overall
an
average
quad
tasted
this
next
to
a
few
others
that
just
blew
it
away
it
is
still
a
good
beer
all
quads
taste
good
but
for
the
style
i
was
a
bit
disappointed
maybe
some
time
would
calm
the
alcohol
and
solvent
notes
down
this
is
a
pretty
tasty
quad
nice
color
right
out
of
the
bottle

brown
fairly
clear

sticks
around
and
nice

but
nice

alcohol
isnt
too
noticeable
pours
a
cloudy
redbrown
with
little
to
no

smells
of
light
fruits
with
a
crisp

smooth
initial
taste
with
a

of

and
a
clean
crisp
finish
poured
a
clear

a
little
lighter

im
used
to
seeing
in
a
quadwith

and
laced

caramel

sugar

cherries
and
currants
a
bit
of
alcoholy
phenols
but
nothing
that
really
negatively
affects
the
taste
a
bit
of
spicy
hops
in
the
finish
medium
body
and
lots
of
flavor
very
nice
to
drink
o
overall
i
think
my
bottle
have
have
been
different
than
the
average
one
so
take
this
review
for
what
its
worth
drinkability
was
exceptional
and
everything
else
was
nice
but
it
didnt
seem
all
too
much
like
a
quad
o
very
tasty
and
smooth
pretty
heavy
so
its
more
of
a
sipper
would
be
great
in
the
winter
probably
not
something
id
have
on
a
regular
basis
but
a
nice
change
of
pace
would
probably
go
well
with
a
big
fat
belgian
waffle
o
tough
style
to
live
up
to
and
this
certainly
doesnt
fall
short
i
just
feel
like
something
is
left
out
mouthfeel
leads
you
to
believe
its
going
to
be
a
huge
quad
and
it
just
dies
on
you
overall
it
is
pretty
wonderful
as
a
quad
and
affordable
too
pours
a
clear
garnetcopper
color
with
a
singlefinger
white
head
that
falls
quickly
into
a
thick
collar
around
the
edges
a
few
bubbles
on
top
as
well
no
real
lacing
the
nose
brings
forward
some
strong
plum
and
prune
character
along
with
milder
dark
fruits
in
the
background
light
cherry
and
a
very
faint
amount
of
caramel
the
flavor
is
sweet
with
a
strong
prune
flavor
and
not
much
balance
seems
like
a
malty
sweetness
with
fruit
no
real
yeast
participation
lightmedium
body
with
low
carbonation
and
a
bit
of
booze
not
a
big
fan
overall
though
nothing
seriously
wrong
with
it
o
a
bottle
of
reverend
is
never
too
far
from
my
fridge
for
the
price
and
availability
its
one
of
my
favorite
quads
out
there
overall
drinkability
decent
beer
but
since
im
comparing
it
to
the
westvleteren
12
it
is
losing
serious
ground
nearly
by
default
thats
not
to
say
thats
the
fault
of
this
beer
it
just
has
stiff
competition
overall
this
is
a
very
respectable
quad
from
avery
i
will
certainly
look
to
drink
this
one
again
great
beer
a
really
great
beer
nice
lower
carbonation
to
let
the
flavors
come
through
if
youre
not
in
belgium
to
get
what
they
have
to
offer
this
is
a
great
alternative
this
beer
pours
a
red
amber
color

a
trace
of

that
does
not
retain
or
lace
well
the
atoms
has
hints

spices
the
taste
starts
caramel
sweet
and
then
has
notes
of
pumpkin
and
spices
the
mouthfeel
is
balanced
but
fairly
watered
down
overall
a
good
belgian
quad
this
belgium
style
quad
is
amber
in
color
and
has
pronounced
notes
of
caramel

well
balanced
and
wonderfully
complex
with
a
nice
warming
sensation
from
the
alcohol
d
not
bad
a
little
too
sweet
for
me
good
spice
o
not
bad
for
a
quad
considering
the
pricing
is
affordable
its
a
big
beer
with
a
small
price
o
its
a
decent
entry
quad
because
its
not
too
extreme
however
there
are
many
better
quads
d
well
this
isnt
readily
available
anymore
unless
i
buy
out
the
rest
of
the
stock
at
corkscrew
but
i
probably
wont
do
that
too
nutty
and
boozy
i
kinda
wish
i
had
someone
to
help
me
finish
the
bomber
its
good
but
im
just
not
that
into
it
this
beer
pours
a
dark
amber
color
with
very
little
head
the
smell
is
strong
there
is
a
nut
note
and
strong
cherry

the
taste
is
malty

infused
with

alchool
taste
overall
good
but
not
the
best
medium
to
full
bodied
nice
carbonation
for
the
style
a
very
drinkable
sipping
beer
i
had
this
one
on
tap
up
at
the
brewerys
tap
room
poured
a
nice
amber
color
with
a
minimal
amount
of
light
white
foam
aromas
of
light
brown
sugar
caramel
candied
fruits
and
alcohol
on
the
palate
this
one
is
fairly
sweet
with
a
nice
bready
character
and
a
lingering
alcoholic
warmth
note
i
had
two
bottles
in
the
cellar
and
the
second
was
as
bad
as
the
first
small
mild
hint
of
sourness
in
the
nose
but
overall
its
a
big
malty
beer
some
alcohol
burn
powering
through
the
taste
as
well
not
as
complex
as
other
quads
ive
had
it
looks
nice
but
i
just
didnt
dig
the
flavors
all
that
much
worth
a
try
but
not
something
ill
be
seeking
out
again
o
a
nice
quad
not
as
complete
as
a
trappistone
but
still
nice
overall
quite
pleasant
its
a
bit
more
harshly
grainy
and
less
sweet
than
many
other
quads
which
im
not
sure
fits
the
style
but
its
still
a
good
beer
taste
starts
rich
sweet
and
caramely
then
moves
through
some
molasses
and
dark
bread
finishes
with
an
alcohol
flourish
and
leaves
lingering
hints
of
fruit
throughout
taste
is
better
than
the
aroma
by
a
longshot
here
faint
note
of
grassy
hops
is
notable
not
as
thick
and
creamy
as
a
bernardus
or
westy
12
and
the
malts
are
of
a
lighter
variety
more
toast
and
caramel
as
opposed
to
chocolate
and
roast
glad
i
drank
this
relatively
fresh
i
dont
think
oxidation
would
go
well
here
pretty
tasty
one
of
the
better
american
renditions
of
the
style
d
easy
boozy
and
slightly
sticky
in
the
mouth
mouthfeel
smooth
not
robust
definitely
a
nice
one
for
the
summer
for
me
crisp
not
overally
sweet
o
a
very
good
attempt
in
a
very
competitive
class
o
good
stuff
though
they
ought
not
call
it
quad
it
should
deem
itself
belgian
style
strong
dark
as
the
term
quad
is
classified
for
beers
either
from
trappist
breweries
or
from
those
who
make
beer
nearly
as
complex
as
them
this
is
fairly
one
dimensional
and
makes
for
a
good
beer
at
a
cost
which
is
appropriate
7
95
a
btl
overall
decent
beer
decent
price
not
something
i
would
seek
out
but
a
worthy
solo
beer
if
you
had
to
drink
only
one
bomber
in
the
night
aroma
is
everything
you
would
want
in
a
quad
rich
malty
backbone
hints
of
prunes
figs
earthy
tones
and
light
caramel
sweetness
that
is
balanced
nicely
against
a
tight
profile
of
light
spices
really
well
done
very
nice
full
feel
with
near
perfect
carbonation
is
exactly
what
i
was
looking
for
the
flavor
opens
up
with
loads
of
dark
fruits
and
brown
sugar
colliding
with
light
spices
and
a
smooth
even
flavor
that
hides
the
alcohol
and
smooths
the
palate
really
just
a
tremendously
good
offering
here
overall
beastly
full
flavored
quad
that
sticks
to
the
tradition
style
and
is
pretty
damn
tasty
this
is
a
good
beer
with
an
interesting
dark
fruit
character
though
it
isnt
a
person
favorite
i
can
see
buying
it
again
without
question
the
alcohol
is
well
hidden
overall
pretty
let
down
maybe
i
will
revisit
this
beer
with
some
age
on
taste
a
pretty
good
quad
albeit
a
small
one
a
direction
i
didnt
see
it
going
in
but
thats
okay
since
taste
was
pleasant
i
will
probably
come
back
to
this
one
o
despite
this
being
absolutely
nothing
like
my
initial
expectations
i
am
thoroughly
impressed
with
this
brew
its
also
absolutely
outofaverycharacter
not
in
terms
of
quality
but
in
its
raw
levels
of
brute
testosterone
technically
i
should
inflict
endless
suffering
upon
the
reverend
on
the
grounds
that
it
clearly
fails
to
abide
by
traditional
category
guidelines
but
im
not
going
to
do
that
this
is
perhaps
the
perfect
example
of
why
i
believe
beers
should
not
be
held
to
strict
standards
of
styles
per
se
if
its
a
great
beer
or
a
shocker
of
one
then
it
should
remain
so
regardless
of
the
words
written
on
its
label
the
picture
on
the
bottle
the
color
of
the
glass
or
the
marketing
and
hype
attached
to
it
at
the
end
of
the
day
a
beer
is
what
it
is
and
in
this
instance
the
ominous
reverend
is
nothing
other
than
a
wonderful
brew
whose
makers
maybe
dismayed
at
its
ultimate
description
being
simply
delightful
pretty
good
stuff
considering
the
abv
it
drinks
very
well
and
isnt
too
boozy
not
nearly
as
spicy
as
i
thought
it
was
going
to
be
but
quite
delicious
m
d
good
balance
lots
of
flavor
crisp
yet
a
little
sweet
alcohol
is
not
blatant
good
carbonation
overall
pretty
good
id
have
it
again
overallconsidering
i
havent
had
many
belgian
styles
in
a
while
this
was
a
good
one
to
wake
my
palate
up
too
good
affordable
beer
got
me
pretty
buzzed
after
the
bomber
too
going
to
seek
out
some
more
belgians
soon
a
disappointment
frankly
i
was
hoping
for
more
out
of
this
one
o
a
decent
quad
but
nothing
thats
much
above
average
hides
the
10
well
nothing
worth
seeking
out
too
much
this
beer
is
a
bit
lighter
than
i
would
normally
expect
in
a
quad
it
is
garnet
colored
with
a
nice
dense
light
tan
head
the
aroma
is
mostly
belgian
yeast
with
a
mild
sweetness
and
a
bit
of
alcohol
it
has
a
good
spicy
clovey
flavor
from
the
yeast
with
a
low
level
of
fruitiness
the
mouthfeel
is
light
as
it
should
be
but
does
not
have
good
high
levels
of
carbonation
that
i
would
expect
overall
good
drinkable
light
quad
not
the
best
but
definitely
a
solid
offering
by
avery
o
the
beer
definitely
tastes
strong
but
the
alcohol
is
well
masked
however
its
definitely
a
beer
that
needs
to
be
sipped
because
of
all
the
sweetness
o
overall
a
nice
take
on
a
quad
by
avery
nothing
that
is
going
to
blow
your
mind
but
goes
down
easy
and
is
very
pleasing
while
watching
the
ncaa
tourney
o
probably
the
best
americanborn
belgian
quad
ive
had
complex
and
strong
really
a
heavyweight
in
the
alcohol
department
so
be
careful
id
drink
it
all
day
if
it
werent
so
strong
good
thick
two
finger
head
and
excellent
lace
structure
the
color
of
the
brew
matches
a
18
on
the
srm
beer
color
chart
smell
is
sweet
with
fragrances
of
raisin
honey
clover
malt
strawberry
roasted
oats
and
barley
the
taste
is
sweet
with
flavors
of
raisins
melon
strawberry
cherry
figs
honey
spices
clover
barley
malt
melon
and
oats
very
creamy
feeling
over
my
tongue
and
palate
other
than
being
quite
sweet
and
high
in
alcohol
i
could
drink
quite
a
few
of
these
this
brew
goes
good
with
desert
and
sharp
cheese
deceivingly
strong
a
little
too
sweet
to
warrant
another
spicy
with
raisin
and
hint
of
cherries
undesirable
aftertaste
very
small

valueat
6
99
orange
to
amber
in
color
purchased
from
giant
eagle
overall
a
tasty
and
drinkable
american
quad
that
although
somewhat
onenote
is
still
a
great
beer
the
medium
mouthfeel
and
the
relatively
well
hidden
alcohol
make
this
an
interesting
brew
to
try
but
be
careful
of
the
high
abv
not
very
drinkable
to
me
due
to
the
excessive
sweetness
alcohol
is
well
blended
with
a
simple
clear
flavor
mostly
one
dimensional
but
smooth
and
easy
as
possible
certianly
very
accessible
for
a
quad
and
enjoyable
to
drink
extremely
bready
and
similar
to
the
nose
the
sweetness
provides
a
taste
bud
filter
to
the
alcohol
just
a
bit
and
then
about
halfway
through
the
sip
it
comes
forward
and
says
hello
i
cant
get
the
rum
soaked
cherries
and
raisin
bread
out
of
my
head
here
although
i
do
get
a
hint
of
candy
apple
pomegranate
in
the
finish
its
solid
and
for
just
7
for
this
22oz
bomber
what
a
great
deal
i
paid
17
for
my
last
bottle
of
allagash
four
and
this
one
graduates
in
the
same
class
at
less
than
half
the
price
what
a
delightful
surprise
solid
punchy
sweet
but
not
as
complex
as
the
other
big
dogs
in
its
class
but
at
just
7
bucks
a
bomber
i
didnt
expect
the
type
of
quality
im
getting
here
and
for
that
im
giving
it
a
b
for
a
solid
brew
at
an
amazing
value
the
beer
pours
an
orangeamber
color
with
a
white
head
the
aroma
is
candy
sugar
brown
sugar
dates
and
alcohol
the
beer
smells
like
a
quadrupel
should
the
flavor
is
heavy
on
the
alcohol
but
i
also
get
a
lot
of
candy
sugar
and
dark
fruit
notes
there
is
also
some
caramel
malt
notes
and
a
little
bit
of
molasses
medium
to
full
mouthfeel
and
medium
carbonation
i
enjoy
most
of
what
avery
has
to
offer
this
is
just
not
as
big
a
success
to
me
as
some
others
in
the
lineup
i
would
recommend
this
to
anyone
drinkability
one
large
bottle
is
going
to
be
more
then
enough
but
i
will
finish
it
a
very
good
quad
that
i
liked
i
dont
have
a
lot
of
quad
history
just
a
touch
of
sweetness
and
i
was
surprised
at
the
very
easy
drinkability
medium
bodied
mouthfeel
with
mediumlow
carbonation
sweetness
starts
to
wear
on
you
after
a
while
knocking
the
drinkability
back
edit
knocking
the
drinkability
score
back
further
really
running
out
of
gas
on
this
one
not
on
the
level
of
a
belgian
quad
you
might
argue
its
a
borderline
quad
to
begin
with
but
then
what
is
i
know
ive
had
this
bottle
for
at
least
a
year
and
it
is
still
pretty
hot
im
getting
redundant
so
age
it
longer
maybe
its
a
good
brew
though
and
i
like
it
hell
ive
enjoyed
it
fresher
than
this
many
times
its
not
koningshoeven
and
what
else
is
but
its
a
good
quad
especially
for
the
price
d
very
potent
abv
sneaks
up
on
you
in
a
bomber
not
at
all
filling
which
has
been
my
problem
with
other
quads
a
really
interesting
affect
to
the
palette
thin
tan
head
and
deep
burgundy
color
very
plesant
aroma
of
abbey
phenolics
tastes
of
caramelly
malt
and
banana
but
the
body
is
appropriately
thin
some
hop
bitterness
on
the
back
end
but
this
isnt
hoppy
in
any
real
sense
d
like
drinking
a
liquified
rum
raisin
bread
d
the
smell
and
taste
are
astonishingly
bad
so
there
is
just
no
drinkability
here
it
is
so
bad
that
i
do
not
have
an
inclination
to
commit
notcritical
elemental
observations
as
to
the
experience
in
the
interest
of
summarizing
my
objection
to
this
brew
however
i
will
pontificate
on
this
matter
of
sheistiness
there
is
a
nasty
wet
hay
element
in
the
malt
and
a
horrendously
foul
mushy
pea
aroma
from
the
hop
contribution
the
essence
of
the
beer
is
putrid
good
clear
colour
and
a
nice
large
creamy
head
when
poured
into
a
large
glass
the
belgian
yeast
scents
are
here
very
appealing
nose
that
beckons
you
to
taste
nice
malty
fruit
based
notes
taste
typical
for
a
beer
of
this
style
quite
sweet
but
it
balances
the
high
alcohal
well
very
easy
to
drink
for
a
10
beer
overall
this
is
a
good
beer
and
i
like
the
labeling
poured
a
dark
ambercooper
color
with
a
small
head
and
lots
of
carbonation
rising
from
the
bottom
begian
yeast
alcohol
fruits
and
a
floral
note
make
this
a
delight
in
the
glass
a
real
creamy
brew
that
is
also
tart
but
not
sour
i
didnt
know
what
to
expect
here
but
i
really
enjoyed
it
10
this
was
smooth
mellow
and
went
down
easy
had
a
hard
time
sharing
it
so
i
just
kept
drinking
man
something
nice
here
d
seems
like
they
used
the
sweetness
to
hide
the
abv
very
drinkable
but
it
really
doesnt
seem
to
be
a
true
quad
dont
get
me
wrong
its
a
fair
bottle
and
i
am
a
fan
of
avery
but
look
elsewhere
in
their
label
middle
of
the
road
beer
for
me
that
i
think
is
miss
labeled
more
of
a
dubbel
for
me
rather
then
a
quad
or
bsda
d
5
0
dangerously
drinkable
you
cannot
sense
the
alcohol
here
the
tastes
are
incredibly
complex
and
clean
and
crisp
at
the
same
time
very
well
done
the
10
alcohol
does
sneak
up
on
you
a
little
you
can
drink
this
pretty
fast
due
to
the
sweetness
but
be
careful
this
beer
would
be
rated
higher
if
it
was
a
tripel
but
its
labeled
a
quad
like
i
said
this
is
sweet
and
you
might
find
yourself
gulping
it
but
at
10
abv
youll
need
to
slow
down
drinkability
is
soild
like
most
quads
its
a
sip
by
the
fireplace
i
like
the
feel
of
this
beer
a
lot
good
job
and
nice
spin
on
this
style
i
wish
i
was
a
better
reviewer
of
beers
tastes
smell
etcc
im
not
great
with
these
so
ill
do
the
best
i
can
here
nice
brown
red
amber
coloer
good
tan
thick
head
nice
taste
really
this
is
a
very
enjoyable
beer
to
drink
nice
fruity
belgium
ill
buy
it
agian
if
i
see
it
d
good
drinkability
the
alcohol
is
not
overpowering
as
expected
you
can
tell
its
10
and
at
this
richness
theres
no
way
im
doing
more
than
one
pour
in
a
row
a
ten
ounce
pour
that
was
dark
reddish
brown
in
color
came
with
no
head
temperature
was
a
bit
too
cold
so
after
first
sip
let
sit
a
few
minutes
aromas
of
malt
goodness
with
a
touch
of
fruit
taste
was
malty
goodness
with
very
little
bitterness
alcohol
content
was
present
but
not
overpowering
drinkability
is
good
if
you
limit
yourself
otherwise
id
say
lower
due
to
the
brew
being
10
ive
had
this
brew
on
several
occassions
and
will
sip
it
again
though
one
is
generally
enough
glad
this
was
a
small
pour
versus
a
bomber
d
good
drinkability
not
a
heavy
alcohol
taste
despite
the
abv
of
10
will
drink
again
md
i
was
really
looking
forward
to
trying
this
one
and
now
that
the
mystery
is
over
this
isnt
one
ill
be
looking
for
again
dont
get
me
wrong
not
a
bad
beer
but
not
a
great
quad
found
it
mostly
too
hot
and
not
well
balanced
and
frankly
not
a
quad
edit
wow
cant
believe
i
am
doing
this
but
bumping
a
few
categories
up
5
i
let
this
warm
up
to
about
55
degrees
and
it
came
alive
overall
impression
decent
quadrupel
but
not
my
favorite
what
it
lacks
in
body
and
carbonation
it
makes
up
in
taste
recommend
serving
at
a
lower
temp
to
enjoy
the
true
flavor
worth
a
try
the
color
on
this
one
surprised
me
the
best
way
to
describe
the
color
on
this
beer
is
that
it
is
the
same
color
as
honey
that
golden
dark
yellow
with
some
orange
in
there
as
well
it
smells
sweet
and
doughy
some
dried
fruits
are
hidden
in
there
as
well
like
apricots
it
taste
a
little
too
sweet
for
my
liking
it
is
a
belgian
quad
that
has
been
americanized
with
over
the
top
sweet
fruit
an
odd
yeast
like
taste
a
dry
finish
with
a
lot
of
alcohol
a
little
too
much
going
on
with
this
one
its
a
very
good
beer
but
be
ready
for
your
taste
buds
to
be
overloaded
with
flavors
very
drinkable
for
the
10
smooth
sweet
and
toasty
american
quad
worth
seeking
out
d
i
wouldnt
exactly
describe
this
as
a
belgian
quad
this
tastes
looks
and
smells
like
a
failed
hot
and
sweet
mess
that
tried
to
be
like
victory
v12
i
was
reluctant
to
finish
it
sweetness
perhaps
too
sweet
a
bit
creamsicle
maybe
but
it
still
tastes
like
that
belgian
quad
the
dark
coloration
and
creaminess
are
major
benefits
but
too
much
is
truly
too
much
with
this
beer
even
when
were
talking
10
flat
abv
it
could
be
easier
to
drink
and
i
dont
like
fighting
sweetness
that
feels
less
manly
d
really
soild
quad
here
i
feel
like
i
pass
up
avery
too
frequently
beers
like
this
remind
me
why
i
need
to
buy
more
from
them
whenever
we
purchase
the
reverend
at
argonaut
liquors
the
checkout
staff
always
teems
over
it
packaging
it
specially
sometimes
praying
over
it
every
time
but
only
at
argonaut
ponders
d
i
dont
think
id
drink
more
than
one
due
to
the
alcohol
and
sweetness
even
though
it
was
decently
hidden
decent
beer
notes
i
have
no
idea
how
old
this
bottle
is
when
i
drank
it
on
91710
its
been
in
my
dbf
for
about
a
month
maybe
6
weeks
before
that
id
venture
to
guess
that
it
spent
at
least
2
years
in
my
cellar
probably
more
like
3
or
even
4
years
it
doesnt
seem
to
be
any
worse
for
wear
as
they
say
d
very
good
the
10
does
not
bite
too
hard
pours
amber
with
a
slight
head
that
doesnt
stay
smells
are
sweet
caramel
malts
with
some
slight
funk
very
pleasant
taste
is
sweet
some
malts
and
some
figs
fruity
with
possibly
some
candi
sugar
mouthfeel
is
sticky
and
chewy
very
good
drinkable
beer
if
you
like
the
strong
belgianstyle
sippers
as
a
digestif
then
this
will
not
disappoint
this
is
very
different
from
averys
barleywine
and
pale
ale
variants
which
have
a
similar
hop
profile
i
was
thinking
all
avery
beers
are
like
maharajawhich
isnt
necessarily
a
bad
thingand
this
was
different
and
therefore
surprising
d
the
10
doesnt
come
through
in
the
taste
at
all
but
i
can
feel
it
on
an
empty
stomach
too
sweet
for
me
to
drink
regularly
and
definitely
not
what
i
expected
from
an
alleged
quadrupel
but
still
very
drinkable
the
reverend
is
a
good
beer
atmosphere
is
pretty
solid
nice
solid
regal
appearance
nose
is
not
complex
but
full
and
robust
flavor
also
not
so
complex
but
pure
full
and
robust
overall
this
is
a
really
good
quaff
d
a
tasty
quad
from
an
american
brewer
really
accessible
and
easy
to
enjoy
up
againts
the
best
from
begium
its
rather
solid
da
nice
boozy
sipper
if
you
like
that
kind
of
beer
not
the
best
or
my
favorite
of
this
style
but
i
enjoyed
drinking
it
m
d
nice
and
fluffy
well
balanced
and
carbonated
boozy
but
not
too
overwhelming
drinkable
and
delicious
higher
abv
opaque
cloudy
redamber
with
average
to
medium
lacing
poured
this
one
into
a
small
wine
goblet
first
whiff
is
a
sweet
candy
some
clove
spice
and
then
a
profound
jab
of
alcohol
burn
at
10
abv
this
ones
definitely
a
sipper
faithful
to
the
belgian
style
but
substantially
more
assertive
quite
tasty
but
perhaps
a
mite
too
heavyduty
to
really
enjoy
often
btw
this
brew
tastes
like
a
distant
cousin
to
a
scotch
ale
i
tried
this
beer
on
january
6
2010
at
the
beerbistro
in
toronto
ontario
canada
this
is
my
first
beer
of
2010
the
beer
poured
a
semitranslucent
orange
brown
with
a
thin
tan
coloured
head
very
light
for
a
quad
the
aroma
was
very
weak
but
did
have
some
malt
and
yeast
the
mouthfeel
was
medium
bodied
and
mildly
carbonated
the
flavour
was
sweet
malt
sugar
yeast
and
plums
a
good
beer
but
not
in
the
same
class
as
trappistbelgian
quad
d
a
good
sipper
when
i
went
into
the
liquor
store
i
started
talking
to
an
employee
and
he
suggested
this
i
am
glad
that
i
tried
it
and
i
did
enjoy
it
but
i
would
not
buy
it
very
often
according
to
averys
website
it
can
be
cellared
for
up
to
4
years
and
i
would
like
to
see
how
it
is
after
that
much
time
served
from
tap
into
a
tulip
pours
amber
with
a
one
finger
white
head
maintains
excellent
lacing
throughout
the
aroma
was
comprised
of
bananas
and
slight
alcohol
the
flavor
was
of
fruit
malt
alcohol
and
pear
upon
swallowing
it
was
light
on
the
palate
with
low
carbonation
overall
this
was
an
excellent
brew
the
flavors
present
definitely
mask
the
alcohol
flavor
but
it
is
still
present
it
is
scary
drinkable
which
could
get
you
in
trouble
quickly
as
it
is
quite
enjoyable
as
well
havent
had
this
one
for
a
while
and
it
was
on
sale
so
i
picked
it
up
very
sweet
reminds
me
of
a
big
doppelbock
kind
of
like
samiclaus
not
a
ton
of
fruity
or
yeasty
flavors
but
still
pretty
tasty
might
be
better
to
split
the
bomber
with
someone
palate
fatigue
from
the
sweetness
drinkability
high
drinkability
both
in
spite
of
and
because
of
the
funkiness
theres
that
word
again
i
know
still
more
than
a
pint
is
a
lot
to
drink
especially
for
something
with
10
abv
just
video
reviewed
this
one
over
at
my
blog
overall
impressions
are
of
a
very
nice
quadrupel
within
the
range
of
those
produced
in
belgium
but
with
a
hoppier
character
and
a
dryer
finish
and
without
some
of
the
more
complex
fruity
character
you
get
from
the
better
quads
very
drinkable
alcohol
wellhidden
given
the
abv
and
definitely
worth
the
price
but
not
the
greatest
quad
ive
ever
had
review
must
be
over
250
characters
and
less
than
5000
apparently
we
shouldnt
be
snobs
but
shouldnt
not
be
snobs
either
md
the
feel
is
medium
bodied
an
quite
harsh
not
what
ive
seen
with
other
quads
the
dinkabilitu
is
ok
but
definitly
not
my
favorite
and
its
a
little
hard
to
finish
because
of
taste
and
feel
the
reverend
is
quite
drinkable
featuring
plenty
of
character
to
offset
the
high
abv
and
a
pleasant
palate
not
for
the
weak
of
heart
but
worth
a
try
if
you
like
the
belgians
this
quad
pours
a
beautiful
burnt
orange
almost
amber
color
with
about
1
finger
of
foam
with
a
pleasant
almost
whipped
appearance
nice
floral
bouquet
with
a
hint
of
sweetness
behind
it
the
taste
is
just
as
pleasant
as
the
appearance
for
me
not
over
powering
alcohol
flavor
considering
the
abv
nice
sweetness
to
startbrown
sugar
and
citrus
orange
notes
coats
the
palate
well
and
has
a
nice
toasty
malt
finish
that
lasts
and
is
slightly
bitter
d
big
abv
to
be
too
drinkable
big
and
complex
even
if
abit
our
of
balance
very
good
i
actually
enjoyed
this
beer
a
lot
it
ended
up
being
way
better
than
i
thought
it
was
going
to
be
and
ill
buy
it
again
i
think
the
biggest
problem
with
this
brew
isnt
the
beer
itself
its
what
it
gets
compared
too
this
beer
is
in
the
same
category
as
westy
12
rochefort
10
and
st
bernardus
12
which
are
three
of
the
top
beers
not
just
the
top
quads
so
its
no
where
near
those
but
that
doesnt
mean
its
bad
because
its
actually
pretty
darn
good
ive
been
drinking
this
beer
for
a
solid
6
months
now
so
it
is
time
for
a
review
this
beer
has
so
many
layers
and
is
so
complex
it
is
pretty
amazing
other
reviewers
give
this
one
a
heavy
alcohol
smell
but
i
cant
detect
it
and
my
wife
who
is
very
sensitive
says
no
to
the
heaviness
after
she
saw
some
of
these
reviews
as
well
this
weekend
we
picked
up
a
few
other
popular
american
quads
and
still
the
reverend
comes
out
on
top
the
complexity
of
this
beer
is
mind
blowing
there
is
really
nothing
like
it
ive
ever
had
it
pours
ok
i
gave
it
a
4
out
of
5
this
quad
goes
down
so
smooth
but
it
isnt
heavy
like
a
typical
belgian
quad
it
does
have
the
this
beer
will
fuk
you
up
if
you
drink
it
fast
though
be
warned
i
really
wish
avery
would
4
or
6
pack
this
one
7
bombers
are
getting
expensive
so
this
limits
us
to
a
reverend
a
week
too
bad
i
have
to
go
to
houston
to
get
these
and
they
dont
have
the
full
lineup
i
could
drink
avery
all
the
time
otherwise
d
the
little
cloying
that
remains
and
the
high
abv
make
prevent
this
from
being
very
sessionable
nice
to
try
though
good
beer
drinkability
not
a
session
beer
because
of
the
alcohol
nice
taste
not
too
rich
pretty
light
for
a
quadrupel
pours
a
wonderful
golden
color
with
beautiful
foamhead
slight
lacing
on
the
glass
smells
like
a
typical
belgian
but
it
tastes
so
much
better
than
most
it
gave
me
a
pretty
quick
buzz
but
i
was
lovin
every
minute
of
it
looking
forward
to
drinking
more
of
this
fine
beverage
would
be
very
glad
to
have
more
of
this
this
isnt
really
close
to
any
other
quad
ive
had
american
belgian
or
otherwise
almost
like
a
barleywine
with
a
slight
belgian
edge
it
definitely
has
character
just
not
a
character
thats
really
pleasing
to
me
ontap
at
beachwood
bbq
pour
was
a
dark
copper
color
with
a
small
head
but
what
bit
there
was
had
good
retention
and
left
some
tracks
first
impression
though
was
that
it
was
a
bit
light
for
a
proper
quad
aroma
has
sugary
plums
light
amounts
of
butter
and
a
vinous
quality
tastes
of
sweet
malt
and
fruits
plums
grapes
light
butteriness
light
phenols
and
a
spicy
cookie
finish
medium
to
full
in
body
with
fuller
amounts
of
carbonation
decent
quad
though
pretty
middling
coming
from
a
respected
operation
like
avery
might
have
been
an
impressive
american
version
of
a
quad
ten
years
ago
but
not
today
the
body
was
good
a
little
on
the
full
side
of
medium
with
a
slightly
sticky
finish
drinkability
was
very
good
ill
certainly
try
this
again
overall
a
good
beer
that
i
enjoyed
but
the
word
that
kept
coming
to
mind
was
light
this
was
perhaps
the
lightest
example
of
this
style
ive
had
still
a
good
beer
and
worth
your
time
notes
overall
very
pleasant
and
enjoyable
d
a
very
straightforward
quad
whcih
could
use
a
more
varied
maltbill
the
malt
quantity
is
adequate
but
the
flavors
lack
some
complexity
still
i
enjoyed
this
a
lot
and
would
give
it
a
try
again
especially
with
some
age
on
it
to
see
if
it
could
develop
more
depth
d
one
bottle
is
enough
for
me
i
would
drink
it
again
at
a
price
tag
of
5
99
for
10
percent
for
22
ounces
but
would
much
rather
buy
a
11
2
ounce
rochefort
10
for
4
99
pours
a
dark
clear
copperamber
with
a
white
filmy
and
quickly
dissipating
light
tan
head
the
nose
is
just
beautiful
toasty
and
sweet
with
candied
fruits
mmm
the
taste
is
dominated
by
sweet
malt
candied
yams
and
fall
with
backrounds
of
dark
fruits
and
pleasant
nuttiness
reminds
me
of
pancakes
and
syrup
never
a
bad
thing
biscuity
goodness
and
sugar
sweetness
alcohol
as
it
warms
im
going
to
seek
out
another
one
of
these
drinkability
definitely
feels
like
it
could
give
a
good
knock
out
so
only
the
22oz
is
all
that
is
needed
it
was
very
drinkable
it
went
down
oh
so
smooth
the
alcohol
was
barley
noticable
which
is
hard
to
pull
off
so
props
to
avery
for
that
for
sure
well
at
10
abv
with
some
challenging
flavors
i
dont
think
this
brew
is
especially
drinkable
or
meant
to
be
lately
i
have
been
trying
to
open
up
to
belgian
beer
styles
i
have
enjoyed
the
new
flavors
but
they
really
havent
become
obsessions
or
new
favorites
this
is
a
good
beer
with
a
monstrous
abv
for
the
price
it
was
fun
picking
it
apart
as
far
as
i
am
able
d
a
bit
of
a
heavy
hitter
but
nothing
too
hot
at
all
it
goes
down
very
smooth
with
plenty
of
warming
which
makes
it
so
much
more
pleasant
to
drink
slowly
as
it
breathes
and
warms
the
flavours
open
up
a
little
more
like
a
red
wine
thats
a
nice
quality
to
have
and
though
i
might
not
put
it
on
the
same
pedestal
as
i
would
with
other
quads
its
still
a
pretty
tasty
beer
odoes
not
come
close
to
other
quads
dont
like
their
yeast
too
sickly
sweet
mouthfeel
is
slick
and
one
tidge
short
of
syrupy
hints
of
candied
fruits
and
a
bit
of
a
funky
alcohol
taste
which
i
like
great
quad
for
the
price
and
its
local
to
me
dgreat
mouthfeel
but
it
just
shows
the
alcohol
too
much
lots
of
funk
in
there
and
im
not
a
big
fun
of
the
big
funk
the
reverend
is
a
pleasant
enough
americanmade
quad
its
not
in
the
same
class
as
a
few
recognizable
belgians
but
at
5
99
for
a
bomber
its
the
best
priced
i
have
yet
to
be
dissapointed
by
averys
big
bomber
lineup
add
yet
another
winner
7
bucks
for
22
ounces
for
a
delicious
quad
this
one
is
a
nobrainer
first
time
ive
tried
a
quadrupel
so
here
it
goes
served
out
of
a
bottle
into
a
pint
glass
poured
nice
with
decent
light
brownish
head
the
beer
was
amber
in
color
with
a
clear
body
it
has
smells
that
are
lightly
fruity
and
hoppy
which
blend
together
well
the
smell
is
reciprocated
with
the
taste
which
adds
a
nice
bite
to
the
whole
mix
for
me
the
alcohol
content
and
bite
that
the
beer
has
make
it
a
little
difficult
to
drink
but
i
like
hoppy
beers
enough
that
i
could
have
a
couple
d
the
alcohol
seems
to
lend
a
bizarre
medicinal
and
astringent
taste
that
isnt
very
pleasing
to
me
yeah
thats
still
sweet
as
hell
i
get
a
little
bit
of
a
medicinal
flavor
now
the
mouthfeel
is
slightly
thin
but
still
good
i
like
a
beer
with
more
substance
though
most
belgians
ive
had
have
been
a
bit
thicker
i
think
ill
have
to
try
this
one
again
to
get
a
full
feel
for
it
and
really
appreciate
it
pours
a
caramel
with
a
light
tan
froth
good
retention
average
lacing
the
nose
is
pronounced
complex
with
aromas
of
caramel
raisins
clove
banana
prunes
toffee
light
earthiness
brown
sugar
very
light
orange
spice
a
sourdough
starter
yeastiness
that
follow
through
on
the
palate
with
additional
flavors
of
dark
belgian
candy
sugar
maple
syrup
figs
alcohol
for
being
such
a
high
abv
beer
the
alcohol
is
well
hidden
overall
this
is
a
very
good
beer
but
unfortunately
not
as
good
as
its
belgian
brothers
to
be
honest
im
on
the
fence
between
a
b
an
a
however
im
an
avery
fan
so
ill
go
with
an
a
recommended
taste
is
awesome
pretty
damn
complex
with
a
light
hoppiness
and
a
solid
toastymalty
backbone
to
it
great
beer
and
my
favorite
quad
after
three
philosophers
pours
a
hazy
copper
color
and
a
lighter
golden
along
the
bottom
of
the
glass
13
inch
head
of
an
offwhite
color
good
retention
and
decent
lacing
smells
of
sweet
malt
alcohol
slight
hops
yeast
slight
citrus
and
molasses
fits
the
style
of
a
quadruple
mouth
feel
is
smooth
and
slightly
creamy
with
an
average
carbonation
level
the
alcohol
is
so
strong
at
first
it
burns
the
throat
but
that
passes
after
the
initial
taste
tastes
of
alcohol
slight
hops
caramel
sweet
malt
slight
tart
malt
and
a
toffee
sweetness
overall
the
alcohol
is
not
well
blended
but
otherwise
a
good
body
complexity
and
aroma
poured
from
22oz
into
a
chalice
glass
had
thin
head
that
faded
immediately
pours
light
amber
copper
and
very
clear
which
i
found
surprising
for
a
quadruple
aroma
is
malt
and
toasted
malt
with
slight
hints
of
fruit
taste
is
also
of
the
malt
up
front
then
hints
of
alcohol
finish
which
could
be
masked
better
the
viscosity
of
this
beer
is
thin
but
the
body
still
shows
through
well
and
is
accompanied
by
a
good
flavor
profile
that
is
typical
of
the
style
over
all
a
good
belgian
considering
it
comes
from
colorado
d
one
22oz
bottle
is
plenty
a
great
brew
to
share
with
a
friend
a
must
if
you
like
quads
and
are
lokking
to
define
the
style
for
yourself
upon
revision
i
realized
what
it
reminds
me
of
malta
i
tried
it
with
tequila
once
and
this
tastes
pretty
damn
close
poured
into
a
tumbler
it
produces
a
small
head
that
doesnt
last
long
and
leaves
little
lacing
the
appearance
is
amber
and
a
bit
cloudy
the
smell
is
slightly
of
grassy
hops
maybe
some
piney
character
there
the
taste
is
of
roasted
malt
with
a
little
chocolate
and
moderate
hops
the
high
alcohol
is
noticeable
and
does
not
blend
well
like
adding
a
jigger
of
everclear
to
a
pint
weve
all
done
that
right
if
i
were
in
the
mood
to
get
hammered
it
would
be
nice
the
feel
is
full
bodied
and
i
get
the
alcohol
in
the
finish
not
one
of
which
to
drink
one
after
another
but
interesting
d
this
was
a
very
disappointing
beer
i
have
thus
far
enjoyed
most
of
averys
offerings
but
this
one
falls
very
short
it
really
doesnt
even
fit
the
style
at
all
this
was
definitely
not
a
bad
bottle
its
just
not
in
the
ballpark
so
to
speak
let
alone
the
same
planet
not
a
good
a
style
example
as
the
ruler
series
brethren
maharaja
d
nothing
spectacular
here
not
the
quad
taste
i
was
hoping
for
d
overall
not
the
best
quad
out
there
but
by
no
means
the
worst
definitely
worth
a
try
but
dont
be
surprised
if
you
can
find
a
better
quad
out
there
a
light
off
copper
color
with
white
lacing
around
the
edges
smell
is
fruity
almost
grapey
mouthfeel
is
light
and
bubbly
taste
isnt
highly
complex
but
has
a
sweet
church
wine
characteristic
to
it
the
sweet
taste
makes
this
a
more
welcome
albeit
strong
spirit
i
was
hoping
for
something
more
complex
from
this
beer
i
hate
to
be
let
down
from
one
of
my
favorite
breweries
the
drinkability
is
a
bit
hard
not
too
hard
to
drink
a
bomber
but
i
wouldnt
be
opening
another
only
moderately
complex
but
still
a
very
enjoyable
quad
high
abv
is
noticeable
and
reduces
drinkability
d
not
that
great
disappointed
would
be
the
word
i
would
use
the
abv
10
is
there
but
it
is
drinkable
better
options
out
there
too
sweet
i
think
almost
like
a
jolly
rancher
d
very
doable
though
a
bomber
might
be
a
bit
much
right
now
dont
get
that
much
booziness
at
all
which
is
good
easy
to
drink
for
the
most
part
the
sweetness
is
a
bit
overdone
in
my
opinion
still
a
tasty
quad
from
an
american
brewery
i
wouldnt
mind
having
this
again
this
one
starts
off
pretty
good
but
at
the
end
of
the
sip
everything
goes
wrong
nice
orange
peel
finish
thanks
to
avery
for
bringing
a
cask
of
this
down
to
trinity
pours
a
hazy
brown
with
a
thin
tan
head
nose
has
ripe
fruits
candy
malt
and
peppery
yeast
taste
has
herbal
yeast
spicy
alcohol
and
bready
malts
medium
body
is
well
carbonated
cask
definately
adds
to
the
mouthfeel
and
overall
complexity
notes
i
must
recognized
that
im
not
very
learned
about
quads
not
even
at
my
aficionado
level
and
sure
i
was
sort
of
expecting
something
more
something
more
special
if
i
had
not
had
those
preconceptions
i
would
have
probably
enjoyed
more
what
was
a
solid
and
nice
brew
and
yet
next
to
other
quads
or
certainly
the
complexity
of
most
barley
wines
it
felt
a
bit
quite
a
bit
actually
for
me
forgettable
recommended
d
i
like
it
it
is
a
bit
of
a
heavy
beer
but
i
wouldnt
shy
away
fron
having
it
again
if
given
the
opportunity
denjoyable
beer
abv
to
high
to
enjoy
too
many
d
average
nothing
special
but
it
is
not
terrible
md
the
mouthfeel
is
slightly
short
of
bar
syrup
very
thick
and
cloying
and
not
bad
for
style
overall
this
is
exceptionally
boozy
and
hard
to
drink
this
my
mouthfeel
score
the
feel
is
severely
thick
and
syrupy
highdensity
like
a
redwine
smooth
and
oliy
and
big
this
is
a
solid
quad
all
around
its
complex
and
bittersweet
like
a
hefty
red
wine
and
a
fruity
white
this
quad
struggles
to
find
a
taste
but
the
taste
cant
make
it
through
the
wall
of
syntheticchlorophenol
flavor
which
greets
you
with
the
first
sip
its
a
big
beer
a
sipper
for
sure
took
a
lonnng
time
to
finish
closing
notes
i
rated
this
beer
as
i
did
because
i
dont
consider
it
poorly
made
or
anything
its
not
my
type
but
it
seems
rather
unique
if
its
not
exactly
a
belgian
quad
well
its
not
exactly
made
in
belgium
its
an
american
craft
ale
from
an
american
craft
brewery
with
a
lot
going
on
for
that
i
couldnt
rate
it
very
high
but
i
wouldnt
discount
it
either
drinkability
its
not
bad
but
i
will
not
likely
be
looking
for
this
one
again
the
off
scent
in
smell
is
a
bit
of
a
turn
off
and
the
flavor
just
doesnt
match
up
with
others
in
the
style
d
the
alcohol
is
definitely
there
in
the
this
one
so
it
is
definitely
a
sipper
it
isnt
the
best
quad
that
ive
tried
but
definitely
not
the
worst
the
im
a
little
disappointed
as
this
doesnt
really
compare
well
at
all
to
the
better
quads
ive
had
d
somewhat
drinkable
i
would
enjoy
a
big
bottle
to
myself
i
think
that
this
would
go
nicely
with
roasted
meat
given
its
sweet
toasted
malt
character
it
would
overwhlem
any
seafood
preparation
maybe
a
glazed
tuna
would
work
a
nice
hunk
of
stilton
or
aged
cheddar
with
a
slice
of
dark
bread
would
also
work
nicely
maybe
even
a
toffee
preparation
overall
good
but
not
quite
as
complex
as
coprable
belgian
versions
overall
a
pretty
good
beer
but
not
the
first
quad
id
reach
for
though
i
do
like
the
slightly
hoppy
twist
drinkability
overall
id
be
lying
if
i
said
i
didnt
really
enjoy
it
its
too
sweet
for
me
though
and
i
really
like
a
sweet
belgian
theres
just
not
enough
other
interesting
flavor
to
balance
the
sweet
for
me
good
but
not
the
same
ballpark
as
the
classic
quads
like
st
bernardus
or
rochefort
not
even
the
same
sport
poured
into
a
snifter
for
a
clear
ruby
brown
body
with
a
quickly
receeding
head
that
is
wellcarbd
a
thick
smell
of
caramel
and
other
sugary
goodness
along
with
yeast
and
some
dark
fruits
also
a
hint
of
spice
and
fruits
like
orange
and
grape
slightly
medicinal
though
a
heavy
fullbodied
slightly
smoothcreamy
brew
where
the
abv
pokes
out
a
little
there
is
a
little
bit
of
yeasty
fluffiness
for
a
slight
bready
mouthfeel
along
with
carmelized
malt
and
some
sweetness
finishes
with
a
quasisour
hop
bitterness
backbite
that
is
mostly
smooth
and
clean
contains
some
orange
and
grape
taste
a
somewhat
complex
brew
that
isnt
bad
but
is
just
a
little
off
to
be
a
really
good
quad
looking
forward
to
another
bottle
overall
this
beer
is
really
well
done
it
has
all
the
characteristics
i
would
expect
in
a
belgian
quad
but
it
may
be
lacking
in
the
subtle
qualities
that
define
the
genuine
originals
final
thoughts
this
beer
is
a
little
different
from
other
belgian
beers
ive
had
its
got
a
much
more
onedimensional
flavor
less
complexity
than
what
you
normally
expect
with
belgians
still
a
very
good
beer
i
like
beers
that
pull
off
nice
caramel
sweetness
and
the
reverend
certainly
does
forgive
any
spelling
and
grammar
errors
in
this
review
this
beer
hides
its
10
avb
pretty
well
and
i
drank
all
22oz
in
about
12
minutes
pours
a
pleasant
brick
red
colour
with
a
limited
head
im
really
struggling
with
the
nose
yeast
and
bubble
gum
with
alcohol
fumes
but
somehow
not
repulsive
the
taste
reflects
the
nose
but
with
a
slight
woodiness
and
maybe
a
hint
of
vanilla
or
even
aniseed
i
dont
dislike
this
i
find
it
surprisingly
one
dimensional
yet
remarkably
difficult
to
describe
shockingly
easy
to
gradually
drain
a
large
bottle
of
such
a
strong
beer
admittedly
this
is
my
first
quadrupel
and
this
one
tasted
good
enough
to
peak
my
interest
but
i
imagine
that
there
are
ones
out
there
that
are
a
lot
more
balanced
and
smooth
id
like
to
try
more
of
this
style
to
compare
serving
type
bottle
d
clean
light
character
keeps
this
one
flowing
beer
poured
into
my
rochefort
chalice
forms
a
2
cm
head
that
dies
quickly
minimal
lacing
but
a
nice
burnt
orange
color
nose
is
malts
a
little
citrus
and
some
floral
almost
purfume
like
hop
notes
pretty
complex
and
appealing
nose
here
creamy
mouthfeel
is
immediately
noticeable
along
with
a
straightforward
malt
presence
finish
is
a
bit
bitter
with
a
prolonged
warming
alcohol
sensation
i
enjoyed
this
beer
quite
a
bit
but
there
are
some
that
are
a
notch
above
mouthfeeldrinkability
this
was
thick
and
creamy
in
the
mouth
with
a
very
full
body
and
a
dry
finish
d
a
definite
sipper
i
look
forward
to
enjoying
more
from
avery
d
certainly
a
sipper
without
much
experience
with
the
quad
style
i
am
not
sure
how
well
it
stacks
up
to
its
peers
but
i
think
it
is
a
good
introduction
and
it
certainly
has
me
thinking
about
exploring
further
d
im
not
too
sure
about
this
beer
on
one
hand
it
isnt
all
that
bad
but
im
not
reminded
of
a
quad
when
i
drink
it
too
clear
too
carbonated
and
too
cloying
not
to
mention
the
strange
funkiness
in
the
background
i
will
probably
pass
this
up
the
next
time
i
see
it
d
definitely
a
drinkable
beer
despite
the
10
this
stuff
was
strong
delicious
and
i
will
definitely
be
going
back
to
pick
out
more
quadruples
to
try
a
very
good
beer
this
was
my
first
quad
and
it
only
enticed
me
to
try
some
others
there
is
a
fair
amount
of
carbonation
and
there
is
some
bite
to
it
it
takes
a
while
for
it
to
become
creamy
but
it
does
medium
bodied
goes
down
fairly
easy
though
the
alcohol
has
quite
a
large
presence
interestingly
i
did
not
find
it
to
be
as
sweet
as
others
in
fact
i
found
it
fairly
well
balanced
though
it
is
of
course
sweet
and
maltheavy
drinkability
not
super
high
great
beer
though
the
abv
and
sweetness
bring
the
drinkability
down
i
think
its
a
good
example
of
the
style
d
i
dont
know
how
to
respond
to
this
one
its
kind
of
like
having
a
sandwich
where
the
bread
is
on
the
inside
and
you
have
to
eat
the
pepper
separately
this
has
many
of
the
right
ingredients
and
a
lot
of
potential
but
right
now
its
kind
of
just
thrown
together
with
a
little
refinement
the
rough
edges
on
this
beer
could
make
it
very
good
right
now
its
just
decent
i
wont
buy
this
again
soon
but
if
i
hear
the
formula
has
been
tweaked
ill
pick
it
up
i
really
enjoyed
this
beer
on
to
the
beer
looks
like
clear
dark
honey
a
nice
ring
of
white
foam
smells
like
wild
orange
blossom
honey
and
sugar
with
belgian
yeast
strain
notes
taste
is
spot
on
for
an
americanized
quad
sweet
almost
cloying
with
earthy
bready
qualities
and
a
pronounced
tangy
alcohol
finish
mouthfeel
is
near
creamy
with
the
abv
and
immense
sweetness
its
a
bit
of
a
sipper
drinkability
pretty
decent
quadrupel
not
the
best
but
definitely
one
i
could
have
a
few
of
for
this
style
mouthfeel
is
a
bit
sticky
one
bomber
this
time
was
fine
alcohol
is
strong

well

id
buy
this

soon

would
recommend

purchase

a
whopper
of

that
you
definitely
notice
the
gravity
as
you
are
sipping
it
a
flavorful
quadrupel
especially
as
it
warms
the
alcohol
slightly
outweighs
the
other
flavor
profiles
at
times
this
offering
is
a
nice
treat

there
are
other
quadrupels
that
i
enjoy
more

sweet
and
malty
alcohol

none

thick

so
sweet
it
almost
hurts
my
teeth
this
beer
is
about
as
drinkable
as
a
quad
can
be
as
far
as
this
style
this
one
of
my
favorites
i
drink
this
often
but
ive
had
better
quads
just
harder
to
come
by
but
they
bring
this
ones
ratings
down
a
little
overall
a
very
solid
quad
this
is
a
big
beer
no
doubt
its
complexity
is
there
but
it
still
seems
a
bit
rough
still
a
good
beer
though
well
done
by
avery
as
usual
good
beer
i
could
of
drank
more
than
one
very
smooth
and
balanced
despite
the
10abv
d
i
really
enjoyed
this
one
a
very
nice
sipping
beer
for
a
cool
evening
i
think
buying
a
bottle
to
cellar
is
in
order
drinkable
but
i
would
prefer
a
bit
more
carbonation
its
a
pretty
straight
forward
beer
but
it
packs
a
big
punch
would
be
a
nice
nightcap
great
job
avery
time
for
a
refill
22oz
bottle
i
poured
the
remaining
beer
in
my
glass
the
beer
got
even
heavier
and
sweeter
as
i
continued
drinking
i
found
it
increasingly
hard
to
finish
but
i
gutted
it
out
it
felt
like
it
was
sticking
to
my
tongue
and
teeth
there
was
no
way
i
was
going
to
get
beat
by
a
quad
i
have
to
admit
though
i
couldnt
drink
two
reverends
i
either
got
a
bad
bottle
or
this
is
not
good
notes
admittedly
im
not
the
most
experienced
with
quads
but
the
few
that
i
have
had
were
exponentially
more
complex
than
this
the
flavors
that
are
there
are
decent
but
become
increasingly
uninteresting
as
the
glass
empties
also
way
too
sweet
for
my
personal
preference
not
great
but
not
horrible
valiant
effort
by
avery
but
it
just
falls
short
all
things
considered
approachable
and
drinkable
with
lots
of
character
and
interesting
aromas
and
flavor
very
different
than
virtually
every
other
belgian
strong
dark
or
quad
i
have
had
a
big
brew
that
is
not
for
the
squeamish
but
considering
the
wallop
it
packs
actually
quite
drinkable
scarily
so
poured
a
copperamber
color
with
a
head
that
rapidly
dissappeared
leaving
a
hint
of
lacing
that
marked
its
presence
really
sweet
smelling
so
much
that
i
approached
my
first
sip
with
trepidation
i
cant
stand
a
super
sweet
to
the
point
of
cloying
taste
in
my
beer
and
i
was
worried
this
is
where
this
smell
was
taking
me
fortunately
it
wasnt
the
case
yes
this
beer
tasted
sweet
but
it
was
a
complex
multiple
fruit
flavors
type
of
sweet
definetly
not
overbearing
the
10
0
was
there
but
hidden
reasonable
well
and
i
got
a
lot
of
different
flavors
during
my
time
with
this
beer
apple
figs
yeast
caramel
one
bomber
was
plenty
but
i
enjoyed
the
complexity
of
this
brew
so
far
everything
ive
had
from
avery
has
been
worthwhile
and
the
reverend
delivered
an
noteworthy
experience
review
written
from
quick
notes
during
the
bcs
championship
and
before
i
drowned
my
sorrows
poured
a
clear
almost
pale
amber
with
strawberry
hues
i
had
to
take
a
second
look
at
the
label
to
make
sure
i
had
the
correct
brew
as
it
looked
more
like
a
belgian
strong
or
such
what
little
head
that
existed
fades
quickly
with
some
small
streaks
of
lacing
left
along
one
side
of
the
glass
smelled
of
pears
and
various
other
dark
fruits
and
malts
once
again
not
at
all
what
i
was
expecting
but
maybe
its
just
me
tastes
of
sweet
malts
candy
alcohol
some
more
light
fruits
and
maybe
even
some
chocolate
sweetness
with
some
phenolic
activitiy
wrapping
things
up
it
was
medium
bodied
and
fairly
well
carbonated
while
this
wasnt
what
i
was
expected
or
what
i
look
for
in
a
quad
it
wasnt
a
bad
tasting
beer
that
being
said
as
much
as
i
dig
averys
brews
i
probably
wont
be
going
back
to
this
one
if
im
looking
for
a
quad
drinks
easy
but
a
bit
of
an
alcohol
bite
in
the
finish
mouth
is
slightly
oily
and
thick
pours
a
clear
dark
amber
color
with
a
small
offwhite
head
that
had
poor
retention
very
little
if
any
lacing
is
left
on
the
glass
the
smell
is
typical
for
a
quad
smells
very
sweet
with
sugar
and
the
malt
some
dark
fruit
is
also
detected
the
taste
is
also
sweet
has
a
tart
apple
quality
to
the
flavor
maybe
some
cherry
as
well
the
alcohol
is
well
hidden
dispite
the
10
abv
medium
bodied
with
abundant
carbonation
nothing
but
average
mouthfeel
not
the
best
american
interpretation
of
a
quad
still
drinkable
because
of
good
taste
and
value
overall
very
good
mouthfeel
and
drinkability
are
good
but
not
great
one
bomber
will
do
for
awhile
at
least
finish
is
warm
candyish
and
warm
with
alcohol
presence
not
as
easy
drinking
as
other
quads
ive
had
picked
it
up
on
a
whim
and
i
am
very
glad
i
did
at
5
99
its
cheap
for
what
it
is
d
a
bit
of
a
challenge
to
the
palate
feels
a
bit
too
heavy
for
me
d
overall
this
is
a
good
beer
thats
true
to
the
style
worth
trying
sometime
not
one
i
would
buy
everyday
but
i
am
glad
i
tried
this
one
pours
reddish
brown
with
nearly
no
head
aroma
full
of
sugar
cherries
and
malt
syrupy
mouthfeel
compliments
the
sweet
and
fruity
taste
lots
of
currants
and
candy
sugar
in
this
one
the
yeast
seems
to
take
a
back
seat
gets
better
as
it
warms
but
still
keeps
the
sweet
character
reviewed
on

bottle
pours
brown
with
a
small
light
tan
head
aroma
of
belgian
yeast
not
much
fruit
in
the
aroma
flavor
was
of
candy
sugar
raisin
molasses
some
spices
sweet
but
not
too
sweet
not
a
great
quad
but
a
good
beer
nonetheless

this
is
good
stuff
and
as
good
as
any
belgian
quad
that
i
have
had
the
aroma
first
hits
you
with
candy
sugar
then
a
complex
mixture
of
yeast
bread
dark
fruit
and
spice
the
flavor
is
exactly
like
the
aroma
but
with
more
alcohol
than
detectable
from
the
aroma
the
palate
is
almost
sticky
from
the
sugar
this
is
highly
recommended
pours
a
dark
burgundy
color
with
a
foamy
tan
head
spicy
and
fruity
aroma
with
a
nice
touch
of
maltiness
very
quaffable
for
such
a
high
abv
spicy
and
malty
yet
sweet
with
hints
of
candi
sugar
cherries
and
other
dark
fruits
such
as
raisin
date
prune
etc
notes
from

drinkability
a
fine
respectable
attempt
at
the
style
but
comes
up
a
bit
short
when
stacked
against
the
superior
belgian
examples
still
though
it
is
an
enjoyable
sipper
from
the
good
folks
over
at
avery
notes
a
big
beer
which
delivers
on
its
promise
of
being
that
big
it
does
not
hold
a
candle
to
three
philosophers
i
will
have
to
rinse
out
my
snifter
quickly
to
shield
it
from
the
memory
of
this
guest
quad
orange
pour
hefty
white
head
uh
oh
very
floral
aromas
some
hops
characteristics
of
white
ales
overly
lively
in
the
mouth
and
a
bit
thin
too
much
light
red
fruits
citrus
hop
bitterness
to
me
this
was
just
not
a
quad
no
molasses
malt
of
any
sort
raisin
doughiness
similar
to
most
belgian
double
and
tripels
that
i
do
not
care
for
aroma
is
strong
very
malty
with
a
rich
fruity
overtone
and
hints
of
caramel
and
toffee
color
is
a
beautiful
clear
reddish
copper
and
head
is
fairly
thick
and
finebubbled
flavor
is
sublime
malty
fruity
nutty
strong
hop
hints
touches
of
caramel
and
sweetness
even
a
teeny
bit
of
smoke
texture
is
smooth
and
aftertaste
includes
a
hint
of
brandy
and
a
soupcon
of
sweetness
definitely
a
beer
to
be
revered
smooth
rich
fullbodied
warming
at
end
of
swallow
light
effervescence
almost
a
sipping
beer
extraordinarily
good
beer
a
must
drink
i
love
these
guys
avery
kicks
ass
pours
a
medium
brown
color
with
an
aroma
of
flowers
and
some
alcohol
has
a
smooth
taste
with
a
slightly
oily
texture
and
some
carbonation
slight
bitter
hoppy
taste
nuttiness
has
an
odd
taste
similar
to
some
other
belgian
ales
ive
had
enjoyable
beer
right
in
line
with
most
belgian
traits
but
its
tough
to
convince
myself
that
this
is
a
true
quadrupel
medium
copper
pour
huge
head
and
nice
lacing
inviting
aroma
sugary
with
that
familiar
belgian
yeast
strain
sharp
and
biting
on
the
tongue
the
finish
is
strong
with
a
huge
alcohol
burn
its
alright
flavor
is
also
strong
and
very
solid
big
candy
sweetness
mixed
in
with
a
good
showing
of
crisp
hops
some
yeasty
earthiness
backed
up
with
a
fruity
hint
overall
a
decent
sipper
not
my
favorite
beer
from
avery
and
certainly
not
best
of
this
style
i
have
had
not
close
to
what
some
of
those
belgian
brewers
pump
out
still
not
bad
for
the
money
would
probably
skip
next
time
though
just
too
boozy
for
my
palate
bomber
could
be
split
between
three
people
easily
worth
trying
d
overall
a
good
american
take
on
the
quadrupel
the
reverend
is
well
made
and
definitely
flavorful
not
a
bad
beer
but
not
the
kind
i
could
drink
a
lot
of
while
good
a
case
of
too
much
of
a
good
thing
is
bad
the
high
alcohol
content
would
limit
my
intake
but
a
nice
change
of
pace
i
walk
away
from
this
one
with
the
memory
of
seaweed
and
even
as
a
result
of
that
not
really
the
most
memorable
quad
ive
had
so
far
i
think
id
pass
next
time
on
this
one
d
not
going
to
buy
again
definitely
can
see
how
some
would
enjoy
but
ive
just
had
better
of
its
nature
d
this
is
a
good
quad
and
i
found
the
flavour
to
have
a
lot
more
structure
and
concentration
than
when
i
had
it
for
the
first
time
back
in
2006
definite
rebuy
has
an
dense
icedtea
appearance
in
the
glass
with
a
tan
head
not
much
body
however
rather
thin
and
even
a
bit
watery
at
times
while
youll
find
thing
like
crackers
fruit
and
some
caramel
in
the
malty
base
what
is
most
present
is
alcohol
bordering
on
booze
the
alcohol
is
quite
overpowering
and
hides
just
about
any
flavor
that
might
be
hiding
in
the
bottle
if
you
like
avery
brews
its
worth
trying
the
reverend
but
im
sure
there
are
better
belgian
quads
available
still
another
very
good
beer
from
avery
this
is
another
amazing
beer
to
taste
as
it
ages
while
the
2008
vintage
is
good
the
older
it
gets
the
more
complexity
and
balance
the
beer
achieves
with
the
2002
ranking
1st
out
of
the
3
pours
a
relatively
clear
vibrant
reddish
copper
in
color
with
next
to
no
head
aroma
is
pleasant
with
some
fruity
esters
apples
and
pears
as
well
as
some
darker
fruits
as
the
beer
warms
and
some
nice
phenols
there
is
also
the
occasional
whiff
of
alcohol
which
gives
the
drinker
an
idea
of
the
potent
alcohol
content
of
this
brew
the
flavors
like
the
aroma
are
relatively
subdued
there
is
a
fair
amount
of
malty
sweetness
here
as
well
as
some
of
the
lighter
fruit
phenols
found
in
the
aroma
in
the
sweet
finish
there
is
also
some
funk
its
not
overwhelming
but
does
add
a
bit
of
distinctiveness
to
an
otherwise
tame
beer
mouthfeel
is
pretty
good
despite
the
sweetness
this
beer
is
fairly
wellattenuated
with
a
mediumish
body
and
moderate
carbonation
alcohol
is
well
masked
drinkability
is
about
average
this
beer
really
didnt
show
me
too
much
character
and
seemed
a
bit
muddled
at
times
drinking
several
bottles
of
this
in
a
session
would
be
easy
the
drawback
is
that
with
10
abv
you
wont
remember
doing
it
mouthfeel
is
crisp
loads
of
flavor
sweet
and
hot
paired
perfectly
with
applewood
smoked
cheddar
ohhhh
so
good
i
like
this
and
its
definitely
a
smooth
drinkable
beer
but
a
little
too
sweet
for
me
to
consider
drinking
more
than
one
a
bomber
is
plenty
pours
a
maple
syrup
caramel
with
highlights
of
cherry
wood
great
amber
resin
clarity
almost
gives
this
beer
a
syrupy
look
very
little
head
or
foam
after
the
pour
and
even
fewer
bubbles
fruity
caramel
covere
appples
and
even
a
few
nuts
start
the
flavor
profile
elegantly
toasted
malts
meld
with
some
herbal
hops
that
give
a
rosey
flavor
pretty
warm
alcohol
gives
the
caramel
and
fruits
more
complexity
the
palate
is
syrupy
and
warm
but
not
boozey
lots
of
fruits
and
som
banana
nut
bread
qualities
a
sippable
night
cap
beer
d
good
quad
not
too
sweet
nice
creamy
feel
a
good
americanmade
belgian
brew
the
mouthfeel
is
great
smooth
and
not
too
heavy
washes
through
the
mouth
gracefully
medium
bodied
with
a
confusing
thickness
to
it
sometimes
it
feels
heavy
but
the
next
sip
will
seem
watered
down
oddly
inconsistent
with
its
mouthfeel
this
one
seems
to
be
a
beer
trying
to
be
a
belgian
it
makes
a
valiant
effort
but
falls
short
of
the
mark
nice
i
like
it
and
will
enjoy
drinking
on
a
regular
basis
dfor
10
it
is
not
a
chore
but
be
careful
about
cracking
a
second
bottle
its
more
of
a
slow
sipper
i
like
their
others
much
better
maharaja
in
particular
overall
it
was
okay
average
pretty
much
across
the
board
dont
think
that
i
would
get
this
again
when
there
are
much
better
beers
out
there
d
really
didnt
impress
me
as
much
as
their
other
beers
abv
was
fairly
well
hidden
for
its
10
0abv
but
was
still
enough
to
take
notice
and
hinder
this
a
slow
casual
sipper
probably
wouldnt
consider
this
for
future
consumption
overall
split
a
22
oz
bomber
with
my
gf
this
is
a
good
twist
on
a
belgian
style
quad
very
tasty
very
potent
almost
reminds
me
of
an
english
barleywine
it
isnt
what
i
would
buy
if
i
wanted
a
real
belgian
style
quad
but
i
would
definitely
buy
this
again
just
because
it
was
tasty
and
drinkable
pours
a
beautiful
ruby
red
amber
decent
amount
of
frothy
head
that
quickly
dissipated
there
appears
to
be
a
decent
amount
of
carbonation
mostly
coming
from
the
very
center
of
my
goblet
the
smell
is
mostly
of
dark
fruit
yeast
and
spice
taste
is
pretty
good
dark
fruits
coming
through
providing
some
sweetness
but
not
as
much
as
some
other
quads
theres
some
spiciness
as
well
the
alcohol
is
there
and
noticeable
its
a
bit
warming
and
adds
to
the
spiciness
its
drinkable
and
enjoyable
not
my
favorite
quad
but
worth
a
try
id
buy
it
again
just
to
mix
things
up
pours
a
very
nice
copper
at
first
turning
to
a
light
brown
later
with
a
little
garnet
glint
with
some
very
nice
head
and
lacing
nice
deep
scent
very
broad
very
malty
with
a
huge
caramel
scent
deep
drink
in
flavor
as
well
vaguely
sweet
from
the
malt
but
a
huge
amount
of
caramel
with
fig
undertones
and
a
nice
malthop
balanced
ending
it
goes
down
nice
with
just
a
bit
of
alcohol
tinge
to
it
d
this
one
crept
up
on
me
and
actually
made
me
fall
asleep
probably
because
of
the
high
but
unnoticable
abv
great
stuff
next
time
i
will
share
the
bottle
this
is
a
nice
example
of
a
quad
its
not
overly
sweet
and
alcoholic
tasting
like
most
other
quads
at
10
i
could
only
really
have
one
of
these
during
a
drinking
session
its
a
fine
beer
and
i
would
recommend
picking
up
a
bottle
d
i
enjoyed
this
but
its
very
different
for
the
style
the
alcohol
is
well
masked
so
it
would
be
easy
to
have
another
but
if
youre
craving
a
quad
this
probably
isnt
for
you
pleasant
orangeamber
pour
transparent
and
leathal
rich
lacing
holds
well
from
the
nice
colorful
head
malty
sweet
and
sour
smell
sweet
and
mildly
floral
hints
with
intense
zesty
finish
saying
ah
huge
body
but
mildly
filling
sucked
this
one
down
rather
easily
so
i
definitely
needed
an
intermission
after
the
first
12
oz
its
a
circus
on
your
palate
this
brew
was
somewhere
between
a
red
and
amber
color
i
was
a
little
disappointed
with
the
head
and
head
retention
as
there
was
not
much
of
either
the
smell
was
fantastic
though
sweet
and
yeasty
the
taste
was
good
although
almost
too
sweet
for
me
i
enjoyed
the
first
glass
from
the
bomber
but
by
the
time
i
started
the
second
i
was
looking
for
something
a
little
less
cloying
overall
a
tasty
brew
but
could
use
a
little
more
character
to
round
out
the
intense
sweetness
definitely
a
sipping
brew
a
good
and
pleasant
belgian
style
ale
that
i
enjoy
it
seems
typical
and
maybe
a
bit
too
sweet
though
i
did
not
have
any
trouble
finishing
a
bottle
something
i
would
try
again
poured
a
translucent
amberorange
color
with
no
foam
to
speak
of
and
no
lacing
this
is
probably
due
to
the
high
alcohol
content
but
was
expecting
a
little
more
smell
is
belgian
yeast
pancake
syrup
and
some
bigtime
earthiness
taste
is
sweet
as
can
be
lots
of
belgian
candi
sugar
large
doses
of
malt
raisins
a
bit
of
apple
cider
sourness
lots
of
warming
alcohol
and
slight
hop
bitterness
in
the
finish
sweet
as
can
be
super
thick
and
full
bodied
moderate
carbonation
not
highly
drinkable
due
to
the
high
abv
but
a
relatively
nice
interpretation
of
a
belgian
quad
i
pass
by
this
all
the
time
at
greens
in
atlanta
and
it
took
the
pressing
of
a
server
in
oklahoma
city
for
me
to
try
this
pours
a
deep
copper
color
looks
like
an
ipa
weird
with
a
ivory
frothy
head
that
leaves
a
lot
of
lacing
on
the
glass
smells
is
incredibly
sweet
alcohol
malt
and
brown
sugar
taste
is
not
what
i
was
expecting
at
all
traces
of
molasses
caramel
brown
sugar
maybe
some
fruit
overall
this
is
a
very
satisfying
beer
not
what
i
was
expecting
at
all
i
will
definitely
pick
this
up
in
atlanta
when
i
get
back
poured
into
a
snifter
its
a
nice
deep
caramel
color
with
red
and
brown
hues
and
a
thick
white
head
that
quickly
thinned
out
and
hugged
the
glass
and
it
has
some
mild
lacing
there
is
some
good
active
carbonation
and
its
crystal
clear
it
smells
fruity
almost
like
dried
apple
and
grapes
mixed
together
it
tastes
mildly
sweet
with
a
strong
alcohol
presence
just
a
tad
bit
bitter
on
the
side
of
your
tongue
and
mildly
tart
on
the
tip
of
your
tongue
it
has
a
bitter
aftertaste
with
a
strong
alcohol
flavor
that
really
warms
up
your
mouth
after
warming
up
a
bit
it
picks
up
a
slight
liquor
taste
like
a
warm
whiskey
and
the
overall
flavor
becomes
a
little
sweeter
the
alcohol
in
its
aroma
becomes
more
apparent
and
the
thin
head
sticks
around
too
this
is
a
good
beer
and
tastes
better
at
warmer
temperatures
in
my
opinion
this
is
a
good
beer
for
the
money
i
suggest
it
to
anyone
who
wants
a
decent
quad
at
half
the
price
of
a
good
trappist
i
would
not
suggest
storing
this
beer
in
hopes
of
making
it
better
crack
it
open
right
away
and
enjoy
carbonated
just
right
a
fullbodied
drink
cut
to
pretty
good
drinkability
for
such
a
big
strong
beer
d
much
better
than
last
years
version
very
similar
to
allagash
curieaux
whoa
10
abv
can
really
creep
up
on
you
in
a
hurry
definitely
a
sipper
and
bottled
to
share
the
alcohol
flavor
gets
in
the
way
a
little
but
is
not
a
complete
turnoff
the
smooth
and
calm
aftertaste
makes
it
easy
to
keep
drinking
despite
the
heavy
flavor
d
i
like
this
more
than
several
dubbels
that
i
have
had
and
feel
it
is
more
drinkable
though
i
think
there
could
be
definite
improvements
a
great
beer
and
i
would
easily
recommend
it
to
anyone
22oz
bottle
this
one
pours
a
slightly
ruby
tinged
amber
color
there
was
a
very
small
off
white
head
that
disappeared
almost
immediately
there
is
some
alcohol
to
the
nose
also
notes
of
spices
caramel
and
some
fruits
it
is
very
flavorful
there
are
many
caramel
a
hint
of
spices
maybe
cherries
nice
not
right
on
for
style
in
fact
some
distance
off
still
an
above
average
beer
selection
d
although
the
alcohol
is
by
no
means
hidden
in
this
one
it
is
quite
drinkable
for
such
a
big
beer
no
one
flavor
component
sticks
out
as
exceptional
but
there
is
something
there
where
everything
comes
together
and
makes
the
overall
experience
more
than
the
sum
of
its
parts
certainly
a
beer
to
be
had
again
i
have
a
bit
of
mixed
feelings
about
it
though
it
could
use
more
balance
and
move
towards
the
hallmarks
of
the
style
more
clearly
it
had
a
taste
that
i
liked
well
enough
to
continue
reaching
for
my
chalice
nice
american
quad
looks
good
nice
amber
color
small
head
has
a
decent
yeasty
odor
and
a
sugary
scent
taste
is
nice
not
too
bold
not
too
weak
delicious
drinkable
brew
would
buy
again
it
lacks
the
spiciness
hops
and
berry
flavors
of
some
other
quadrupels
but
its
a
sold
beer
good
choice
notes
way
too
unbalanced
probably
wont
be
picking
this
one
up
again
yikes
this
is
a
big
ol
quad
that
slaps
you
right
in
the
mouth
all
i
can
think
about
is
viya
con
dios
from
king
of
the
hill
when
i
drink
this
one
pours
a
mighty
maraschino
cherry
color
with
a
hansome
head
smells
of
candied
fruit
and
a
bit
of
banana
the
alcohol
kicks
you
with
some
baked
apple
and
candied
sugar
flavors
mild
yeast
and
banana
undertones
enjoyed
in
my
duvel
chalice
pours
a
clear
reddish
color
thin
head
settles
fairly
quickly
smells
fairly
bready
brown
sugar
sweetness
taste
is
candied
fruit
sweet
alcohol
is
readily
apparent
mouthfeel
is
nice
and
smooth
lingers
slightly
on
the
finish
with
a
bit
of
syrup
feel
a
fairly
drinkable
quad
not
my
favorite
style
but
a
solid
brew
nonetheless
the
pour
into
my
st
bernardus
chalice
is
beautiful
crimson
color
with
shades
of
orange
showing
around
the
edges
there
is
a
minimal
offwhite
head
that
leaves
some
loose
spotty
lacing
a
somewhat
light
nose
delivers
pleasantly
sweet
and
fruity
smells
with
a
touch
of
spice
and
alcohol
full
heavy
and
oily
smooth
in
the
mouthfeel
with
minimal
carbonation
the
taste
is
bittersweet
of
belgian
candy
sugar
and
heavy
caramel
maltiness
with
a
modest
apple
fruitiness
rounding
out
the
edges
and
some
alcohol
in
the
finish
its
not
bad
but
far
from
great
not
overly
complex
and
a
bit
rough
around
the
edges
the
taste
was
similar
to
smell
the
strong
belgian
yeasty
was
apparent
the
taste
was
malty
all
the
way
thru
with
little
sweetness
in
the
end
it
left
a
tingling
sensation
on
the
lips
and
in
mouth
it
is
peppery
overall
another
solid
effort
from
sir
avery
this
poured
a
slightly
hazy
bright
bronze
with
almost
no
head
it
smelled
like
copper
hops
mixed
with
banana
and
wild
yeast
it
tasted
halfway
between
a
dubble
and
tripel
rather
than
a
quadruple
with
light
flavors
of
sweet
apricot
and
wheat
the
taste
wasnt
exceptionally
clean
and
had
some
alcohol
warming
it
was
slightly
thick
with
moderate
carbonation
and
a
lasting
tart
aftertaste
overall
this
wasnt
bad
but
it
really
wasnt
deep
or
rich
enough
for
me
to
be
a
really
good
quad
overall
this
brew
was
enjoyable
but
i
wish
the
funk
and
pepper
was
a
bit
milder
so
i
could
get
at
the
fruit
flavors
better
a
milder
yeast
strain
and
a
little
bit
heftier
malt
bill
could
do
this
brew
a
lot
of
good
quadrupel
ale
sounds
enticing
very
minimal
head
which
almost
immediately
disappears
to
a
thin
wispy
ring
oddly
though
the
beer
bubbles
at
a
higher
rate
than
any
beer
ive
seen
held
at
eye
level
it
has
a
red
tint
like
fruit
punch
red
very
clear
appearance
the
10
alcohol
is
fairly
obvious
in
the
beginning
sips
there
is
a
nice
slightly
spicy
bitterness
from
the
styrian
goldings
hops
and
the
aroma
is
exceptional
to
say
the
least
the
sweetness
of
the
candy
sugar
is
evident
especially
as
the
brew
warms
very
evident
in
the
aftertaste
the
concept
of
the
brew
is
very
attractive
to
me
but
im
not
totally
sure
if
they
pulled
it
off
kind
of
a
thought
provoking
brew
i
have
mixed
feelings
about
the
numbers
i
gave
tasted
on
31608
d
technically
its
quite
drinkable
especially
considering
the
abv
but
honestly
i
would
turn
to
another
quadruple
instead
of
going
back
for
more
this
quadrupal
poured
a
orangish
copper
color
with
a
white
lace
of
head
that
dissipated
fairly
quickly
smell
was
average
but
not
as
aromatic
as
i
would
of
thought
it
may
be
seemed
to
be
some
fruity
smells
with
alcohol
lingering
in
the
backround
taste
was
there
and
pretty
good
but
i
was
still
left
waiting
for
more
at
the
end
the
alcohol
was
there
but
not
overpowering
mouthfeel
was
nice
with
the
right
amount
of
carbonation
drinkability
was
also
good
id
recommend
this
beer
drink
up
dark
redbrown
color
i
used
a
goblet
type
glass
to
bring
out
the
aroma
of
spices
alcohol
and
fruit
but
it
was
not
as
aromatic
as
similar
beers
the
flavor
was
not
as
complex
as
i
had
hoped
sweet
dry
flavor
of
fruit
and
alcohol
overall
i
expected
more
complexity
and
flavor
from
a
quadrupel
it
is
worth
trying
though
in
my
limited
experience
american
quadrupels
are
either
hit
victory
v12
allagash
four
or
miss
sly
fox
ichor
founders
bad
habit
the
reverend
is
closer
to
being
a
miss
than
a
hit
if
youre
looking
for
an
avery
brew
that
is
similar
but
better
in
all
respects
look
no
further
than
hog
heaven
barley
wine
id
try
this
on
tap
again
but
probably
wouldnt
spring
for
another
bottle
its
just
too
rich
d
great
beer
for
the
price
one
bomber
is
more
than
enough
for
a
sitting
d
a
sipper
due
to
the
high
alcohol
content
but
thats
ok
theres
plenty
to
enjoy
but
the
problem
as
you
may
have
picked
up
already
is
that
its
so
damn
sweet
boy
im
getting
wordy
in
my
advancing
age
this
is
a
well
made
quadrupel
from
avery
and
one
worth
trying
d
the
rev
packs
one
hell
of
a
punch
after
this
bottle
i
feel
woozy
at
10
it
aint
no
candy
not
a
session
beer
though
that
would
make
for
a
pretty
short
night
pours
a
light
gold
in
color
with
some
ruby
highlights
no
head
appears
on
the
pour
smell
is
belgian
candy
sugar
and
some
delicious
dark
fruits
in
plenty
taste
is
the
same
in
sugar
and
dark
fruits
mouthfeel
is
full
and
creamy
and
easy
drinking
not
a
world
class
quad
but
4
99
a
bomber
makes
it
an
occasional
purchase
avery
is
fairly
new
to
mo
and
im
looking
forward
to
trying
more
a
decent
u
s
stab
at
a
quad
but
a
bit
too
fruity
far
too
boozy
for
a
session
beer
i
used
it
as
a
way
to
unwind
after
getting
home
from
work
past
midnight
on
a
cold
winters
night
i
would
drink
this
again
but
only
if
i
cant
get
a
st
bernardus
12
the
reverend
was
one
of
the
first
big
beers
that
i
have
ever
enjoyed
i
first
drank
it
about
5
or
6
years
ago
when
it
still
had
the
wax
cap
covering
i
just
drank
it
last
night
which
was
my
first
time
in
a
long
time
it
has
a
beautiful
orange
color
and
a
nice
sweet
malty
aroma
what
i
like
the
best
about
the
reverend
is
that
it
is
very
strong
and
complex
yet
it
is
so
enjoyable
to
drink
there
is
no
harshness
at
all
i
taste
dates
in
the
malt
but
not
overbearing
the
hop
profile
is
low
as
it
should
be
this
is
a
sneaky
beer
in
that
you
dont
realize
that
you
are
drinking
a
10
quadruple
ale
music
enjoyed
whilst
sampling
misconceptions
by
mealticket
this
comes
across
as
just
a
little
bit
boozy
in
a
style
of
beer
that
is
competitive
and
complex
as
a
bang
for
the
buck
quad
this
isnt
too
shabby
i
paid
5
99
for
my
bomber
at
the
whole
foods
at
union
square
but
i
could
do
without
this
particular
brew
pours
a
beautiful
light
copper
color
with
some
mild
red
hues
the
smell
is
good
as
well
sweet
malt
aroma
with
lots
of
fruit
and
even
some
strong
alcohol
taste
is
complex
and
full
first
impression
is
sort
of
wine
like
very
fruity
with
a
strong
alcohol
body
another
really
good
belgian
style
ale
recommended
drinkability
is
okay
i
wasnt
sure
about
this
one
at
first
took
about
half
way
through
the
bomber
to
become
more
enjoyable
for
me
worth
a
try
another
big
solid
brew
from
avery
copped
a
22oz
bomber
from
wine
and
beverage
depot
in
totowa
pours
a
lucid
clear
rubyred
mahogany
hue
with
a
frothy
head
that
soon
dissipated
within
about
a
minute
slight
carbonation
visible
smell
was
outstanding
full
fresh
and
replete
with
fresh
fruits
pears
and
grapefruit
flavor
matched
the
aroma
with
a
strong
floral
caramel
brownsugar
flavored
that
was
sweet
and
flavorful
without
being
overwhelming
or
cloying
one
of
the
better
quadrupels
that
ive
sampled
fullflavored
malty
butter
taste
very
rich
and
thick
with
a
dominant
candy
taste
an
enjoyable
brew
slight
alcohol
presence
but
not
as
noticeable
as
you
would
think
for
a
10
abv
a
solid
offering
from
avery
recommended
easy
to
drink
despite
not
tasting
outstanding
overall
this
is
a
good
quad
maybe
ill
try
to
cellar
it
but
i
probably
wont
seek
it
out
anytime
soon
funny
story
one
of
my
buddies
at
work
was
given
two
or
three
of
averys
big
beer
series
bombers
as
a
present
from
a
friend
not
knowing
what
they
were
he
proceeded
to
down
all
three
in
the
span
of
a
couple
hours
im
sure
he
was
three
sheets
to
the
wind
after
that
experience
hes
now
a
ba
orangemoustache
but
like
all
of
us
he
used
to
just
down
pisswater
brewskies
like
any
redblooded
american
d
easy
to
drink
even
though
it
is
high
in
alcohol
i
will
surely
buy
another
the
refreshing
mouthfeel
and
light
flavor
made
for
a
surprisingly
drinkable
strong
ale
unfortunately
there
was
nothing
really
interesting
about
this
beer
i
agree
with
another
reviewer
that
after
a
while
i
felt
like
i
was
just
drinking
whisky
albeit
a
watered
down
whisky
bottom
line
this
strong
ale
doesnt
taste
bad
a
22
oz
bottle
of
this
is
very
drinkable
and
will
give
you
more
than
a
good
buzz
unfortunately
i
expected
something
deeper
and
more
intellectual
thanks
to
barefootbrewer
for
sharing
this
beer
wiht
me
22
oz
glass
bottle
color
of
dark
honey
with
a
frothy
off
white
colored
head
nose
of
bright
sour
cherries
and
some
malts

taste
of
ginger
cloves
dark
fruit
mango
and
anis
body
is
medium
and
with
medium
carbonation

aftertaste
of
dark
cherries
yeast
gummy
and
lingering
pours
clear
amber
and
i
got
virtually
no
head
off
it
very
little
lacing
nose
is
super
sweet
and
alcohol
is
heavily
present
taste
is
extremely
thick
on
the
mouth
and
you
get
a
firm
syrup
flavor
which
for
me
is
a
bad
start
there
are
tones
of
alcohol
and
fruits
but
overall
it
feels
too
syrupy
on
the
mouth
over
time
this
is
a
characteristic
i
still
cant
come
to
appreciate
this
is
a
sipper
but
not
one
i
would
run
to
the
store
to
grab
again
for
a
quad
id
turn
to
the
rochefort
10
or
most
other
quads
over
this
one
any
day
overall
amazing
yes
amazing
it
is
working
its
way
to
the
top
of
my
list
pours
medium
amber
with
a
golden
shine
what
little
head
there
is
fades
almost
immediately
aroma
is
strong
alcohol
perhaps
some
fusels
and
lots
of
fruity
esters
with
a
little
malt
flavor
is
also
alcohol
up
front
followed
immediately
by
sweet
malt
and
some
hints
of
hops
alcohol
dries
out
the
finish
quite
a
bit
but
not
offensively
so
a
strong
beer
that
tastes
even
more
so
yet
in
a
good
way
a
little
harsh
which
i
dont
remember
before
wonder
if
it
has
changed
perhaps
they
are
fermenting
it
warmer
to
speed
production
with
a
little
trepidation
i
pour
a
8oz
sample
of
the
reverend
from
its
22oz
bottle
into
a
small
tulip
glass
its
orange
in
color
or
a
light
amber
aroma
is
rich
and
deep
hop
spice
rich
malt
caramel
orange
zest
and
alcohol
flavor
is
very
typical
to
the
style
quite
sweet
feel
and
taste
of
alcohol
a
good
amount
of
spicy
hops
that
balances
well
without
being
too
bitter
a
richness
of
malt
and
caramel
upfront
that
fades
towards
the
middle
and
thins
out
with
a
dry
finish
exactly
how
a
belgian
should
be
nice
and
bubbly
mouthfeel
if
you
measure
drinkability
by
how
many
you
could
drink
in
one
sitting
id
say
this
guy
is
low
because
of
the
sweetness
and
alcohol
if
you
measure
drinkability
by
whether
or
not
you
want
to
spit
out
the
third
sip
then
it
rates
well
because
the
flavor
and
complexity
is
excellent
overall
this
is
a
tasty
beer
that
is
quite
different
from
others
in
its
style
dthis
is
a
very
good
american
quad
fairly
drinkable
for
the
and
very
flavourful
avery
is
the
type
of
brewery
i
wish
i
had
around
me
d
this
is
one
that
i
would
have
to
think
about
before
ordering
again
understand
that
this
is
a
superior
well
balanced
drink
however
perhaps
for
someone
that
has
a
more
experienced
and
sophisticated
palate
that
i
have
at
this
point
honestly
i
really
need
to
give
this
one
another
go
and
maybe
revise
my
review
later
drinkability
a
sweeter
quad
id
probably
enjoy
it
more
at
around

comment
i
expected
a
more
trappist
quadlike
appearance
and
taste
its
difficult
to
compare
this
brew
with
the
trappists
quadrupels
rather
it
is
more
in
the
class
of
the
bush
quad
which
has
a
higher
abv
but
similar
appearance
a
flavor
both
this
and
bush
are
wonderful
quads
just
not
directly
comparable
to
the
special
joy
found
in
rocheforts
pannapots
and
their
ilk
d
high
alcohol
so
one
is
enough
but
i
did
have
two
to
test
out
the
theory
one
of
the
finest
from
avery
brewing
company
the
reverend
a
kind
and
forgiving
chap
is
a
terrific
belgian
quadrupel
full
of
spice
and
vim
at
10
abv
look
out
it
packs
a
wallop
that
you
can
certainly
feel
in
the
second
half
of
the
bottle
the
reverend
pours
a
rich
head
atop
a
brownishred
body
well
presented
the
smell
and
taste
exude
spice
all
the
way
yet
with
a
sweet
taste
that
enmeshes
very
well
with
the
spices
hints
of
cherry
and
molasses
with
a
slightly
roasted
flavor
are
present
impressive
all
the
way
and
one
of
the
best
domestic
belgianstyle
brews
in
the
us
not
to
be
passed
up
and
very
high
on
my
list
d
the
quad
is
a
whopper
so
one
bomber
is
the
perfect
size
for
a
late
fall
night
overall
its
not
bad
for
sure
not
in
the
top
of
quads
but
well
done
diff
the
10
is
somewhat
hidden
in
here
this
one
goes
down
way
to
quick
overall
a
solid
quad
that
aged
well
pours
a
dark
bronze
color
with
a
creamy
white
head
with
a
little
lacing
smell
is
of
candied
sugar
some
grapewine
aroma
dried
fruit
and
some
slight
yeasty
taste
is
honey
some
spice
and
sweet
malt
mouthfeeling
is
thick
and
smooth
very
nice
quad
and
very
smooth
pours
a
coppery
orange
with
a
little
whitish
head
little
lacing
slight
chill
haze
sweet
aromas
of
malts
and
a
little
caramel
some
fruitiness
and
a
little
alcohol
detected
taste
is
similar
but
a
little
tart
mouthfeel
is
a
little
lacking
i
would
expect
it
to
be
a
little
thicker
on
the
palate
for
a
quad
butdtill
an
alright
beer
for
5
i
might
be
drinking
some
more
of
this
in
the
future
its
sure
no
st
bernardus
abt
12
but
still
a
decent
brew
its
worth
noting
that
i
recommend
this
beer
as
it
warms
up
drink
it
while
it
is
to
cold
and
you
will
miss
out
on
a
lot
of
the
complexity
of
the
beer
the
alcohol
definitely
makes
its
presence
known
with
an
almost
mediciney
finish
overall
it
was
a
very
interesting
experience
in
a
good
way
i
look
forward
to
more
beers
of
this
type
not
a
bad
quad
but
not
one
of
the
best
ive
had
with
the
abv
i
wouldnt
have
more
than
one
at
a
time
but
it
is
a
beer
that
i
would
revisit
in
the
future
very
enjoyable
while
not
boasting
what
id
call
a
true
belgian
profile
it
is
a
very
good
beer
amber
in
color
toffee
caramel
and
light
fruit
aroma
tan
lacey
head
sweet
and
smooth
sugar
filled
with
not
much
of
a
hint
of
alcohol
very
good
for
an
american
twist
on
this
classic
style
of
beer
that
the
belgian
people
have
perfected
avery
rarely
disappoints
and
this
is
another
example
of
why
they
are
a
great
brewery
dlike
quads
in
general
you
have
to
watch
it
or
you
will
find
yourself
talking
to
goblins
and
stubling
around
that
is
what
happened
to
me
during
my
first
encounter
with
this
beer
if
you
enjoy
quads
and
wish
more
american
micros
made
the
type
this
is
worth
a
sample
created
by
god
feared
by
satan
loved
by
all
indeed
this
is
my
second
time
trying
out
this
beer
the
evil
looking
reverend
on
the
bottle
should
suggest
something
about
the
beer
he
looks
like
hes
gonna
kick
your
ass
and
he
certainly
does
at
10
hell
lay
waste
to
you
and
youll
enjoy
his
ass
kicking
maybe
its
not
the
best
belgian
but
its
pretty
damn
good
and
usually
not
that
expensive
either
a
bomber
ran
me
like
6
or
7
in
atlanta
bang
for
the
buck
and
great
taste
mouthfeel
well
worth
it
i
ran
out
of
my
bomber
fast
and
wanted
more
that
says
something
doesnt
it
i
really
enjoyed
this
beer
and
i
recommend
it
to
everyone
22
oz
bomber
poured
into
a
duvel
tulip
cream
head
doesnt
hold
long
smells
of
belgian
candy
sugar
and
belgian
yeast
phenols
candy
maple
notes
mouthfeel
is
smooth
and
slightly
syrupy
taste
is
slightly
hot
and
phenolic
which
i
personally
dont
mind
at
all
that
sometimes
comes
with
a
high
abv
beer
this
is
really
a
solid
example
of
an
american
style
quad
the
flavors
are
very
pleasingly
sweet
and
smooth
but
not
deeply
complex
the
hop
schedule
is
more
apparent
than
an
authentic
belgian
quad
in
fact
this
offering
is
more
like
a
3
5
in
between
a
tripel
and
a
quadrupel
with
its
golden
orange
color
a
very
solid
example
of
an
american
style
belgian
quad
and
a
highly
enjoyable
beer
as
far
as
drinkabilty
goes
i
personally
could
put
down
a
couple
of
these
bombers
and
feel
all
nice
and
warm
good
job
avery
this
beer
had
some
great
aspects
the
slight
medicinal
taste
hurt
the
drinkability
but
this
beer
had
many
other
redeeming
qualities
and
the
bomber
went
down
easy
mouthfeel
is
smooth
and
not
excessive
it
poured
a
rich
amber
color
with
a
light
golden
head
after
the
maharaji
i
wondered
if
there
was
going
to
be
a
big
surprise
in
an
unexpected
flavor
coming
through
but
it
was
much
more
subtle
i
detected
a
slight
smell
of
banana
but
not
very
strong
i
also
got
this
feeling
in
the
taste
plus
a
richness
of
berries
even
without
a
true
berry
taste
it
had
a
very
rich
taste
that
i
found
very
drinkable
somewhat
like
cognac
this
was
a
keeper
split
a
22
oz
bomber
with
some
good
friends
poured
into
a
tall
rounded
white
wine
glass
a
wonderful
copperred
with
a
bubbly
white
head
that
leaves
a
heavy
ring
of
lace
around
the
glass
smells
and
flavors
of
sweet
syrup
candy
burnt
sugar
yeast
bananas
and
some
liqueur
like
brandy
tart
even
fermented
apples
hides
the
alcohol
well
very
strong
and
sweet
character
a
bit
overpowering
but
still
really
good
to
drink
small
sharp
fizz
on
the
middle
of
the
tongue
a
very
pleasant
quad
fine
example
of
the
style
watch
out
for
the
10
abv
but
otherwise
enjoy
22oz
bomber
poured
into
a
tulip
glass
very
pretty
beer
gold
thick
white

nice
lacing
wellcarbonated
the
aroma
of
a
lollypop
big
taste
fruit
candy
malt
alcohol
yeast
a
wellconstructed
beer
fun
to
drink
the
10
abv
makes
it
a
beer
to
savor
the
appearance
is
decent
but
the
flavors
just
arent
balanced
quite
well
enough
its
fairly
smooth
and
drinkable
albeit
spicy
but
it
does
go
decently
well
with
a
good
food
pairing
like
swiss
to
help
round
out
the
experience
not
a
bad
brew
but
ive
tasted
a
couple
better
from
this
style
this
beer
looks
beautiful
poured
into
a
belgian
glass
dark
amber
color
beautiful
bubbly
carbonation
lacy
two
finger
head
has
curves
and
some
junk
in
the
trunk
has
a
sweet
fruity
alcohol
smell
that
makes
you
think
if
jolly
rancher
made
alcohol
this
would
be
it
very
big
taste
overwhelming
at
first
sweet
malt
sugar
alcohol
all
tastes
lingering
at
the
end
you
have
to
be
in
the
mood
for
this
beer
if
you
are
enjoy
it
as
it
is
a
big
sweet
beer
with
alcohol
to
put
you
out
enjoy
over
time
i
am
a
big
fan
of
quadrupels
and
like
my
beer
a
little
on
sweet
side
as
well
this
one
fit
the
bill
on
both
accounts
nice
carmel
color
mediocre
head
the
taste
is
sweet
and
although
it
sports
a
hefty
abv
the
alcohol
was
not
particularly
noticable
i
liked
this
beer
alot
as
good
an
american
quadrupel
as
ive
had
and
better
than
many
of
the
belgian
ones
i
would
and
will
be
purchasing
the
reverend
again
mouth
taste
is
fruity
but
too
sweet
the
sugars
cover
up
the
a
lot
of
the
potential
depth
of
the
flavor
its
all
esters
and
alcohol
a
hint
of
cinnamon
with
a
warm
cloying
finish
too
sweet
to
enjoy
malty
and
yeasty
and
mouthfeel
is
oily
slick
mdmedium
bodied
strong
and
sweet
i
find
it
easy
to
drink
at
10
bc
of
the
sweetness
this
one
i
pick
up
when
in
the
mood
for
a
quad
i
suppose
i
have
to
really
be
in
the
mood
for
quadrupels
as
they
are
not
very
sessionable
thanks
to
the
high
abv
well
i
could
session
these
but
that
wouldnt
go
over
too
well
with
my
wife
anyway
this
is
not
to
say
that
it
isnt
a
good
brewit
isbut
at
6
for
a
pint
bottle
i
think
id
rather
pay
the
extra
buck
for
a
genuine
trappist
ale
such
as
chimay
this
is
one
dangerously
drinkable
quad
look
out
it
taste
fantastic
is
highly
digestible
is
readily
available
and
fairly
cheap
my
new
cigar
beer
d
this
was
a
great
treat
but
one
was
quite
enough
for
the
night
the
alcohol
is
strong
and
noticable
in
this
brew
i
wanted
to
switch
to
an
easy
session
ale
after
having
it
something
i
enjoyed
and
i
will
have
again
another
great
offering
from
avery
this
brew
pours
a
cloudy
reddishbrown
color
it
is
quite
lighter
in
color
than
other
quadrupels
i
have
had
the
head
is
small
but
recedes
slowly
and
leaves
nice
lacing
the
aroma
is
of
caramel
and
passion
fruit
there
is
a
faint
hint
of
spices
but
it
is
hidden
behind
the
caramel
and
fruit
the
taste
is
of
caramel
and
spices
with
fruit
in
the
background
the
mouthfeel
is
full
bodied
with
a
lot
of
carbonation
overall
this
is
a
decent
beer
but
not
a
decent
quad
it
is
far
to
lacking
in
spices
to
really
make
me
think
however
it
is
still
rather
tasty
and
i
would
drink
it
again
just
not
when
i
am
in
the
mood
for
a
quad
d
this
is
a
nice
big
quadrupel
from
avery
very
solid
in
all
categories
but
not
quite
reaching
the
utmost
tier
not
the
appearance
that
i
was
expecting
from
a
quad
a
clear
amber
tone
big
frothy
fine
bubbled
creamy
off
white
head
lacing
is
strung
lightly
but
with
regular
patterns
aromatics
bring
out
deep
ripened
fruit
notes
brown
sugar
carmelized
with
raisins
tart
apples
and
spicy
yeast
strain
with
alcohol
flowing
openly
with
no
apologies
flavor
spicy
belgian
yeast
strain
sweet
trademark
candi
sugar
additions
thick
flow
of
raisins
and
tart
apples
with
molasses
sturdy
slighty
burnt
malt
sweetness
herbal
hop
finish
peeks
through
but
not
the
key
player
in
this
show
mouthfeel
has
a
bit
of
a
syrupy
residual
sugar
content
going
on
medium
bodied
and
sticky
flows
with
tightly
bubbled
carbonation
drinkability
is
mediocre
a
style
and
version
of
it
that
drains
the
beer
senses
and
gets
you
happy
or
sad
depending
on
what
type
of
drunk
you
are
d
for
the
abv
this
is
about
right
nothing
spectacular
but
the
alcohol
is
not
apparent
a
unique
quad
worth
trying
i
like
it
but
i
like
other
quads
better
still
not
a
poorly
made
brew
but
any
stretch
of
the
imagination
d
im
not
even
sure
if
i
would
call
this
beer
a
quadrupel
it
doesnt
seem
to
fit
the
style
it
was
a
good
beer
but
i
probably
wouldnt
try
it
again
or
at
least
go
to
great
lengths
to
seek
this
out
i
would
take
an
allagash
4
in
a
heartbeat
over
this
when
it
come
to
u
s
quadrupels
im
a
fan
of
avery
especially
the
maharaja
which
is
one
of
my
all
time
favorites
d
the
smooth
flavor
with
the
alcohol
heat
is
nice
but
there
is
not
much
complexity
or
interest
the
yeast
doesnt
add
much
flavor
to
this
beer
but
it
would
really
help
overall
an
unbelievable
beer
neverending
complexity
makes
each
sip
unique
and
enjoyable
highly
recommended
d
you
know
i
used
to
like
this
beer
a
lot
more
than
im
liking
it
now
its
a
tasty
brew
but
lacks
an
overall
complexity
and
depth
that
one
expects
from
a
top
notch
belgian
style
this
beer
is
so
sweet
it
tastes
like
something
a
hummingbird
should
drink
i
enjoyed
this
bottle
immensley
and
will
have
to
revisit
st
berny
for
a
refernce
point
because
this
was
downright
delicious
warming
effect
a
nice
big
beer
drinkability
very
rich
high
in
alcohol
a
pleasant
beer
to
sip
rich
and
complex
fruity
and
yeasty
creamysmooth
and
thick
pretty
nice
poors
a
copper
color
with
no
hazyness
to
speak
of
a
small
head
goesa
away
pretty
quickly
banana
and
spices
for
the
most
part
in
the
smell
with
a
hint
of
acohol
rasin
and
spices
with
some
maltyness
and
a
bigger
hit
of
acohol
come
with
the
taste
it
cirtainly
has
a
clean
finish
not
the
most
drinkable
even
considering
the
style
would
be
a
good
bomber
to
split
with
someone
drinkability
yummy
this
brew
hides
its
abv
quite
well
perhaps
this
is
too
extreme
for
me
to
enjoy
while
i
like
this
beer
there
is
no
way
i
could
have
more
than
one
at
a
time
make
it
hot
and
sweet
and
call
it
a
quad
hmmm
taste
is
nice
but
its
not
exciting
after
a
halfpint
i
wanted
something
lively
imo
this
is
better
out
of
the
bottle
just
has
more
perk
to
it
this
beer
poured
a
hazy
brown
color
with
a
thick
head
and
smooth
lacing
the
aroma
is
hoppy
and
malty
with
a
hint
of
sour
the
taste
is
very
malty
with
a
touch
of
spice
the
alcohol
is
noticeable
but
suited
to
the
beer
the
mouthfeel
is
full
and
the
carbonation
gives
it
a
nice
pep
this
is
a
very
enjoyable
brew
which
id
consider
highly
drinkable
poured
from
a
bomber
into
a
snifter
glass
the
beer
pours
a
deep
gold
forming
no
head
and
light
rings
of
lace
the
aroma
is
delicous
dark
fruit
not
much
else
but
oh
so
inviting
the
taste
is
just
like
you
would
expect
from
a
belgian
sweet
dark
fruit
flavor
the
hops
and
malts
are
hard
to
seperate
when
it
comes
to
belgians
probably
because
i
havent
had
much
experience
in
tasting
these
brews
but
what
ive
experienced
from
this
one
is
wonderful
very
smooth
mouthfeel
i
could
drink
this
all
night
if
it
werent
for
the
high
abv
overall
a
great
find
i
will
definitely
add
this
to
the
regular
rotation
dlike
many
other
avery
big
beers
this
is
devilishly
easy
to
put
down
without
a
hitch
the
flavors
shine
and
the
booziness
fades
as
the
beer
warms
to
subroom
temp
bottom
line
this
is
my
first
bottle
of
the
reverend
and
id
daresay
it
will
be
my
last
the
flavours
were
just
too
chaotic
for
my
palate
pours
a
crystalclear
bronze
hue
with
a
dense
and
soapy
three
finger
head
just
offwhite
in
color
good
retention
with
spotty
lacing
toasty
malt
light
phenols
orange
peel
and
alcohol
are
prodominant
aromas
some
faint
styrian
hops
and
crystal
malt
make
up
the
rest
the
first
sip
is
full
of
dextrinous
and
bready
toasted
malt
surrounded
by
a
fruity
phenolic
taste
in
a
classic
abbeystyle
sort
of
way
candysugar
comes
out
next
and
with
it
a
boisterous
boozey
kick
the
aftertaste
is
drying
with
little
but
some
herbal
and
mild
hop
flavor
and
aroma
the
alcohol
also
helps
balance
out
the
abundant
sweetess
with
help
from
a
tart
phenolic
presence
mouthfeel
is
mediumfull
with
a
medium
carbonation
that
seems
passable
but
lacking
given
the
style
and
amount
of
lingering
flavors
indeed
the
finish
is
quite
residual
and
sweet
and
only
saved
by
the
dryness
from
the
booze
while
this
was
a
nice
stab
at
the
style
and
i
really
like
the
yeast
profile
and
overall
complexity
the
preception
of
alcohol
is
out
of
control
and
far
to
hot
the
attain
a
respectable
drinkability
the
burn
is
slow
and
clean
like
topshelp
vodka
but
ultimately
too
prominent
even
for
a
quad
and
quickly
becomes
distracting
perhaps
a
few
years
in
the
cellar
would
be
beneficial
but
it
appears
filtered
and
so
would
likely
only
fade
away
some
of
the
more
interesting
yeast
malt
and
hop
nuances
mouthfeeldrinkability
its
pretty
thick
and
syrupy
definitely
a
sipping
beer
that
coupled
with
the
10
abv
renders
drinkability
pretty
low
overall
its
not
bad
worth
a
try
it
wont
be
a
regular
for
me
but
i
wouldnt
be
opposed
to
another
down
the
road
its
a
nice
beer
but
its
a
bit
overthetop
alcoholwise
the
taste
is
generally
nice
but
it
gets
old
pretty
fast
and
its
a
bit
too
sweet
definitely
worth
trying
if
you
like
stronger
or
belgianstyle
beers
but
its
not
the
type
of
beer
to
have
with
any
frequency
ill
probably
have
this
again
but
not
on
my
own
highly
recommended
cheers
for
me
this
beer
was
all
about
the
taste
and
the
drinkability
i
knew
the
alcohol
was
there
but
it
never
got
in
the
way
i
knew
the
candi
syrup
was
there
but
it
didnt
overstay
its
welcome
a
peaceful
beer
that
may
lack
complexity
for
some
but
will
offer
a
safe
haven
to
others
kind
of
like
church
the
reverend
pours
a
copper
color
with
a
white
head
from
a
brown
twenty
two
ounce
bottle
the
aroma
is
good
mostly
i
pick
out
candy
sugar
the
flavor
is
also
good
dark
fruits
and
candy
sugar
its
not
as
complex
as
some
belgian
quads
but
its
quite
enjoyable
nonetheless
it
goes
down
easy
and
packs
quite
a
punch
on
the
back
end
im
feeling
a
good
buzz
after
sharing
a
bottle
recommended
poured
a
light
amber
somewhat
murky
with
a
faint
red
tint
bubbly
pour
not
as
effervescent
as
other
quads
aromas
were
toned
down
as
well
only
a
faint
whiff
of
strong
belgian
yeastiness
caramel
sugars
are
big
though
taste
was
that
of
thick
bready
malts
and
some
orchard
flavors
fresh
not
dried
as
in
some
quads
alcohol
is
present
as
well
as
a
slight
bitterness
not
sure
its
from
any
hop
influence
though
all
in
all
a
little
watered
down
with
some
astringent
flavors
and
younger
sugars
which
dont
work
so
well
with
the
rest
of
the
brew
decent
offering
but
not
among
the
best
the
reverend
pours
a
very
clound
golden
amber
with
a
quickly
dissipating
head
the
aroma
is
sweet
raisiny
malt
fruity
esters
that
are
almost
citrusy
and
a
big
alcohol
twinge
flavor
is
more
fruity
esters
very
sweet
and
malty
with
just
a
hint
of
roasted
taste
there
is
a
lot
of
nice
yeasty
complexity
and
a
big
alcohol
burn
just
a
little
too
much
knocking
down
the
drinkability
slightly
drinkability
a
solid
quad
and
i
believe
its
my
favorite
avery
brew
ive
had
yet
you
can
tell
the
alcohol
is
present
but
its
not
overpowering
spicy
aroma
with
some
malt
sweetness
medium
to
full
body
plenty
of
spicy
flavors
lots
of
clove
residual
malt
sweetness
very
warming
this
is
a
fine
americanized
version
of
a
belgian
style
surprisingly
drinkable
maybe
dangerously
drinkable
for
the
alcohol
level
a
good
try
from
avery
the
flavors
are
really
interesting
but
everything
about
this
beer
is
up
front
and
in
your
face
this
one
leaves
me
wanting
a
bit
more
well
other
than
another
pour
altogether
recommended
d
not
bad
certainly
worth
a
try
i
would
say
this
is
toward
the
better
end
of
the
avery
big
beers
nothing
im
in
a
huge
rush
to
have
again
but
i
might
do
it
sometime
d
lots
of
flavor
and
easy
to
drink
which
is
scary
with
the
10
alc
i
enjoyed
it
quite
a
bit
and
would
gladly
have
another
sometime
on
tap
at
essex
ale
house
this
is
my
first
avery
sample
and
i
must
say
i
was
pretty
pleased
poured
into
a
small
snifter
glass
the
golden
orange
colored
quad
produced
a
nice
fluffy
white
head
that
hung
out
for
quite
some
time
before
breaking
down
into
some
nice
glass
coating
lace
aroma
is
fruity
yeasty
and
sweet
resembles
apricots
and
pears
a
bit
flavor
is
a
huge
juicy
gulp
of
red
grapefruit
juice
nice
clean
and
balanced
hop
flavor
balances
out
the
sweetness
while
this
flavor
is
delicious
i
was
a
little
disappointed
that
i
couldnt
find
much
else
in
there
i
was
hoping
for
some
depth
and
complexity
for
a
quad
body
is
full
and
smooth
with
a
nice
scrubbing
carbonation
not
a
bad
beer
at
all
it
is
quite
delicious
but
i
was
just
hoping
for
a
little
more
poured
into
my
tulip
with
a
very
rich
apple
juice
color
the
creamy
long
lasting
head
off
white
in
color
really
added
to
this
beers
appearance
smelled
of
yeast
with
faint
tart
cherries
in
the
distance
the
taste
was
of
cherries
yeast
and
a
very
subtle
hops
presence
slightly
bready
throughout
the
whole
process
though
this
beer
had
a
nice
firm
heavy
mouth
feel
but
did
not
seem
to
have
quit
the
same
velvety
flow
as
some
of
its
belgian
cousins
considering
the
fact
that
this
was
a
10
percent
treat
it
was
very
sessionable
paired
great
with
semisoft
brie
port
salut
and
green
apple
wedges
enjoy
pours
a
crystal
clear
copperorange
color
under
a
fluffy
and
thick
offwhite
head
quite
odd
the
see
a
belgian
quad
style
beer
so
translucent
without
the
typical
haziness
head
dissapates
quickly
to
some
spotty
blotches
of
foam
no
lacing
noted
aroma
is
of
rich
luscious
ripe
brandy
soaked
black
cherries
figs
dates
and
raisins
against
a
background
of
caramel
malt
and
spices
mouthfeel
is
nicely
balanced
between
the
heavy
chewy
thick
body
and
the
overtly
spritzy
carbonation
which
keeps
the
texture
from
becoming
too
oily
or
slick
the
flavor
profile
of
this
beer
improved
immensely
as
it
warmed
from
its
initial
serving
temp
of
50f
taste
was
very
sweet
and
rich
with
notes
of
belgain
candy
and
dark
brown
sugar
along
with
caramel
candy
apples
raisins
dates
some
faint
banana
and
cloves
and
warming
alcohol
finishes
with
just
a
hint
of
hop
bitterness
to
keep
the
sweetness
in
check
goes
down
real
easy
for
a
10er
found
these
at
a
local
upscale
grocery
market
for
3
69bomber
so
i
picked
up
10
of
them
makes
it
even
that
more
enjoyable
to
get
such
a
nice
price
on
em
overall
impression
seems
light
and
easy
on
the
palate
but
i
know
this
is
a
big
beer
dangerously
drinkable
and
full
of
flavor
one
of
averys
best
and
certainly
the
most
balanced
an
enjoyable
american
slant
on
a
belgian
style
color
is
a
bit
too
light
for
a
belgian
dark
strong
but
overall
an
immensely
enjoyable
beer
this
one
is
a
golden
bronze
with
a
thin
head
that
cant
make
up
its
mind
if
its
going
to
be
rocky
or
creamy
the
small
bubbles
are
microscopic
i
just
love
that
for
no
reason
i
can
really
identify
the
smell
is
hops
up
front
but
the
candi
sugar
comes
on
hard
with
a
caramel
smell
that
reminds
me
for
all
the
world
of
unibroues
trois
pistoles
thats
a
very
good
thing
in
my
book
btw
the
taste
has
a
grasslike
note
which
takes
me
by
surprise
and
is
not
nearly
as
sweet
as
the
smell
this
is
good
as
it
lends
balance
the
caramel
malt
is
there
but
the
sugar
is
really
subdued
odd
really
the
carbonation
level
is
nice
and
after
that
its
all
silk
not
so
substantial
as
to
be
chewy
but
definitely
a
smooth
feel
the
drinkability
is
good
but
limited
by
that
grassy
flavor
i
think
its
the
hops
that
are
beating
me
over
the
head
on
this
one
which
is
strange
to
say
the
least
for
a
quadrupel
i
think
this
is
a
quad
for
hop
heads
good
definitely
good
but
doesnt
stand
up
to
the
quads
ive
had
from
belgium
for
the
most
part
on
draft
at
kclingers
bright
red
with
only
a
thin
veil
to
top
it
off
the
aroma
is
somewhat
raisinlike
onto
the
drink
this
is
exceptionally
smooth
and
easy
to
drink
sweet
syrupy
but
not
too
much
very
well
balanced
why
do
i
think
theres
a
monster
lurking
just
below
the
surface
of
this
innocentfeeling
brew

i
am
interested
in
how
this
beer
and
st
bernardus
abt12
are
the
same
style
as
the
colors
are
completely
different
as
is
the
sweetness
i
bought
this
22
oz
bottle
at
evanston
first
liquors
in
evanston
il
22oz
brown
bottle
with
no
freshness
date
pours
a
medium
amber
with
a
1
finger
head
and
very
good
lace
lots
of
caramel
malts
up
frony
mixed
with
brown
sugar
and
sherry
aromas
again
lots
and
lots
of
caramel
malts
mixed
with
brown
sugar
sherry
dried
fruits
and
a
decent
hop
flavor
and
a
bit
of
bitterness
alcohol
is
hidden
fairly
well
even
at
10
it
is
smooth
and
easy
drinking
not
the
best
quad
out
there
but
still
very
nice
and
well
worth
the
6
99
i
have
this
beer
on
tap
at
my
work
i
drink
about
8
oz
every
day
i
work
along
with
a
few
others
this
is
my
favorite
one
on
tap
withj
its
sweet
full
flavor
the
coloring
is
a
darker
brown
not
much
lace
on
the
way
down
i
love
belgians
and
it
seems
the
darker
ones
are
more
for
my
taste
buds
it
has
a
fair
smell
as
opposed
to
another
avery
belgian
we
have
on
tap
pours
an
auburn
brown
with
a
little
head
definitly
has
a
good
aroma
the
smell
is
upfront
with
a
caramel
sweetness
i
can
definitly
taste
hints
of
orange
cream
butter
and
maybe
ginger
almost
tastes
slightly
like
a
winter
version
of
the
style
i
guess
definitly
a
good
beer
and
fairly
true
to
the
style
it
just
lacked
complexity
very
starightforward
this
is
what
you
get
kind
of
beer
probably
not
something
id
sample
again
nice
ambercopper
body
but
with
a
thin
head
smell
is
sweet
a
bit
yeasty
with
some
alcohol
in
the
background
not
all
that
complex
but
good
taste
is
a
bit
fruity
up
front
then
malty
sweet
then
a
decent
belgian
aftertaste
but
too
sweet
at
the
end
mouthfeel
is
medium
but
dead
i
dont
like
huge
carbonation
in
a
belgian
but
this
seems
a
bit
unlively
drinkability
is
again
good
but
far
from
fantastic
a
delicious
beer
that
ive
been
drinking
regularly
since
at
least
2002
and
will
continue
drinking
as
often
as
i
can
get
my
hands
on
it
not
exactly
a
chip
off
the
trappist
block
this
beer
is
still
pretty
good
its
an
interesting
take
on
the
quadrupel
style
and
a
bit
similar
to
averys
other
big
beers
the
beer
looks
good
even
though
the
amberorange
is
fairly
light
in
color
for
the
style
the
smell
is
nice
enough
with
sweet
fruits
but
isnt
terribly
complex
the
flavor
does
open
up
a
bit
with
raisins
figs
and
dates
mixed
with
marmalade
and
mellow
citrus
flavors
aided
by
hops
i
guess
its
a
relatively
hoppy
quad
but
thats
not
a
bad
thing
the
flavor
isnt
on
the
same
level
as
some
of
the
brews
from
belgium
but
its
oh
so
drinkable
and
smooth
pours
a
clear
dark
amber
with
a
giant
tan
foamy
head
the
head
leaves
good
lacing
and
lasts
a
long
time
the
smell
is
strong
with
clovebananacandy
sugar
and
fruit
pear
this
is
one
of
the
better
smelling
beers
ive
had
in
awhile
the
taste
is
very
sweet
with
candy
sugar
pearalcohol
and
the
typical
belgian
spices
a
nice
tasting
beerbut
be
warnedthis
is
very
sweet
the
mf
is
medium
with
all
the
flavors
mixing
well
a
very
nice
surprise
i
have
to
admit
that
this
is
better
than
i
thought
it
would
be
this
is
a
must
try
d
very
good
belgian
would
have
this
again
for
sure
okay
drinkability
plenty
of
others
better
in
this
style
a
complex
enough
beer
that
you
can
ride
this
one
out
for
a
good
hour
taking
in
its
many
nuances
good
stuff
and
despite
the
10
abv
it
drinks
like
a
slightly
more
sessionfriendly
ale
so
beware
but
most
of
all
enjoy
pours
a
ruddy
orangey
caramel
color
with
a
mediumthickness
head
that
fades
to
a
collar
the
nose
is
mainly
phenolic
with
a
bit
of
cinnamon
and
caramel
malts
in
the
background
the
taste
is
less
phenolic
with
allspice
and
some
sharp
date
fruits
but
that
bandaidish
note
is
still
there
in
spades
very
little
sweetness
for
the
style
mouthfeel
is
pretty
creamy
with
carbonation
that
is
sharp
but
not
big
very
drinkable
for
the
style
with
no
alcohol
burn
present
and
for
a
10
abv
brew
thats
impressive
but
that
drinkability
is
not
matched
by
depth
of
flavor
for
an
american
belgian
brew
its
got
some
interesting
notes
especially
the
phenols
but
it
just
doesnt
have
the
same
oomph
and
the
same
depth
youd
expect
to
find
in
a
belgian
quadrupel
22

alcoholi
in

finish
but
mostly
rich
malt
spiciness
is
there
but
slight
ok
on
the
pallate
not
great
though
overall
a
goodish
beer
but
not
one
that
i
can
class
as
great
the
taste
is
somewhat
bland
slight
hints
of
caramel
and
fruit
with
a
strong
alcoholic
aftertaste
that
is
not
well
masked
the
reverend
is
quite
dry
and
has
low
to
moderate
carbonation
i
would
try
this
beer
once
but
look
for
other
quadrupels
before
purchasing
poured
a
nice
orange
copper
color
a
little
lighter
than
expected
but
the
lack
of
head
retention
and
only
a
small
nonlasting
head
is
what
brings
this
one
down
smell
is
of
caramel
and
dark
fruit
some
cherries
as
well
taste
is
real
nice
starts
out
with
a
burnt
caramel
flavor
toffee
and
some
dark
fruits
i
think
this
may
even
meld
better
with
age
mouthfeel
is
chewy
definitely
full
bodied
with
carbonation
on
the
lower
side
but
still
present
pretty
solid
and
if
i
remember
correctly
the
best
united
states
brewed
quad
that
ive
had
certainly
worth
a
try
i
think
ill
be
picking
up
a
couple
to
age
next
time
served
in
a
large
chalice
glass
pours
a
beautiful
copper
color
with
an
large
solid
head
about
an
inch
tall
creamy
and
frothy
and
longlasting
quite
malty
nose
with
grassy
citrusy
hops
and
subtle
fruitiness
very
malty
but
not
heavy
taste
ripe

character
wellplaced
bitterness
that
balances
well
finish
is
noticibly

detracting
slightly

not

cheers
beertracker
ill
leave
you
with
something
that
a
macrodrinking
friend
of
mine
said
after
first
tasting
the
reverend
true
then
and
still
true
now
the
reverend
takes
sip
whoa
it
tastes
like
a
sin
dits
a
good
belgianvery
sweet
though
i
dont
know
if
i
will
have
more
i
would
drink
this
once
in
a
while
pours
brown
with
a
thin
white
head
smell
is
mostly
malty
and
fruit
cherries
maybe
with
noticable
alcohal
taste
is
fruit
upfront
with
some
malt
characters
followed
with
a
huge
alcohol
flavor
the
aftertaste
consists
mostly
of
a
doughy
taste
probably
from
the
yeast
from
the
quad
style
the
mouthfeel
has
good
balance
in
flavor
but
seemed
flat
and
had
a
very
strong
dose
of
alcohol
it
didnt
seem
like
they
tried
to
mask
the
abv
any
which
i
dont
know
if
they
were
trying
to
do
in
the
first
place
these
arent
the
easiest
to
drink
have
to
have
a
taste
for
quads
but
this
is
a
decent
one
i
enjoyed
this
beer
d
a
very
good
beer
heavy
and
high
in
abv
but
certainly
worth
drinking
not
bad
but
there
is
room
for
improvement
belgian
inspired
but
it
stops
there
still
overall
not
bad
and
i
think
you
should
try
it
for
yourself
if
youre
running
out
of
quads
to
try
pours
rather
flat
an
isolated
patch
of
bubbles
off
center
is
all
that
sits
overtop
the
beer
auburn
colour
with
fiery
highlighting
belgian
character
yeast
both
the
darker
slightly
toasty
malt
notes
like
in
a
dubbel
as
well
as
the
sweet
high
pitched
spices
found
in
a
tripel
on
the
whole
pretty
highly
seasoned
and
peppery
offers
enough
to
keep
you
sniffing
flavour
has
some
layering
starts
a
little
in
high
orbit
a
nimble
note
of
booze
perks
up
its
nicely
chased
away
by
candy
sugar
sweetness
and
amble
enough
malt
base
i
taste
some
lighter
crystal
and
pale
malts
that
blend
well
behind
the
spices
not
sure
if
i
can
detect
even
any
hints
of
cherries
or
currants
as
the
bottle
claims
i
should
but
it
is
seeming
to
reveal
more
as
it
warms
for
the
most
part
though
this
is
far
from
cloying
and
id
say
could
use
a
little
more
texture
a
nice
malt
touch
in
the
finish
that
last
pretty
well
tempered
enough
flavour
to
keep
it
from
being
drab
and
enough
composure
to
keep
it
together
all
in
all
very
decent
american
rendition
of
the
style
thanks
for
the
trade
harry
goodsized
light
tan
head
nice
retention
and
lots
of
tiny
bubbles
that
provided
a
nice
amount
of
carbonation
fruity
estery
almost
pineapplelike
aroma
sweet
malty
alcohol
flavor
with
a
warming
mouthfeel
medium
bodied
and
pretty
smooth
strength
was
a
little
too
noticeable
for
my
tastes
but
still
pretty
drinkable
if
you
like
thick
sweet
high
alcohol
beer
and
i
know
those
folks
are
out
there
then
this
beer
would
probably
rock
your
world
everybody
else
i
would
call
this
an
in
the
mood
for
beer
mediumheavy
bodied
mouthfeel
with
a
decent
level
of
carbonation
smooth
and
warming
but
at
the
expense
of
taste
the
alcohol
taste
in
here
is
just
too
much
very
poor
example
of
a
quad
and
not
even
a
good
beer
this
is
not
a
trappist
brew
for
sure
but
it
gets
the
job
done
brother
in
law
turned
me
on
to
this
ale
among
other
hac
beers
i
have
to
say
that
ever
since
he
has
left
ive
had
a
stock
of
this
in
my
fridge
this
ale
really
leaves
you
wanting
more
if
it
werent
for
the
high
alcohol
content
i
could
easily
have
45
a
night
however
this
is
more
of
a
sipping
beer
and
usually
one
leaves
you
just
right
ive
recommended
this
to
many
friends
who
have
since
placed
this
high
on
their
list
its
alright
not
big
fan
of
the
big
fruity
flavor
it
is
a
sipper
and
could
get
through
a
bottle
in
a
night
but
would
prefer
something
else
pours
an
orangishcaramel
color
with
little
to
no
head
smell
is
malty
and
slighty
yeasty
taste
is
of
brown
sugar
malt
and
a
little
yeast
the
brown
sugar
flavor
comes
through
but
is
not
overwhelming
or
cloying
really
a
very
tasty
beer
not
as
deep
as
other
beers
but
very
satisfying
mouthfeel
is
very
good
carbonation
is
just
right
and
has
a
real
smooth
finish
drinkability
is
almost
frightening
for
a
10
alcohol
beer
could
definitely
drink
this
rather
quickly
i
am
really
impressed
with
this
beer
avery
puts
out
good
beer
but
i
wasnt
expecting
it
to
be
this
good
i
would
definitely
recommend
it
this
is
a
rich
goldenamber
colored
liquid
poured
from
a
22
ounce
bottle
i
had
this
one
after
a
dinner
of
a
nice
steak
mushrooms
and
asparagus
the
beer
is
topped
with
an
offwhite
head
thats
a
little
short
for
the
style
decent
but
unexceptional
lace
the
aroma
is
of
alcohol
and
pale
malts
lots
of
malt
character
in
the
smellcant
overstate
that
theres
also
a
little
fruit
slight
yeast
aroma
and
a
hint
of
herbal
hops
the
taste
is
extremely
sweetno
doubt
a
desert
beer
was
in
the
mind
of
the
brewer
its
syrupy
on
your
lips
an
tongue
theres
a
nice
alcohol
warming
along
with
some
mild
spice
hops
provide
some
wellneeded
balance
and
are
more
bitter
than
i
expected
for
the
style
a
bit
of
resin
and
a
touch
of
citrus
in
the
finish
its
a
wellmade
and
very
enjoyable
afterdinner
beer
id
have
this
one
again
drinkability
all
in
all
very
good
this
is
my
first
quad
and
i
dont
reckon
itll
be
my
last
im
going
to
go
to
this
brewery
on
my
vacation
next
month
looking
forward
to
trying
this
on
tap
deep
ambery
rudy
brown
with
deep
red
high
lights
nice
head
that
dissipated
a
little
too
fast
but
left
nice
lacing
the
head
lingers
around
they
edge
at
minimum
thickness
smells
of
spice
upfront
malt
yeast
some
fruit
esters
and
a
tinge
of
earthy
funk
taste
is
toffee
up
front
with
some
banana
a
bit
of
hops
and
belgian
yeast
decent
mouth
full
and
after
taste
although
there
is
something
about
this
beer
that
ive
had
in
other
beers
specifically
unibroue
that
i
dont
mind
but
im
not
crazy
about
maybe
im
spoiled
my
first
quad
was
st
bernardus
12
which
fucking
ruled
still
this
is
an
enjoyable
beer
and
from
what
i
understand
a
decent
quad
drinkability
quite
drinkable
for
such
a
heavily
alcoholic
beer
10
a
very
nice
belgian
from
an
american
brewery
the
alcohol
and
fruit
flavors
can
get
to
you
before
this
becomes
a
session
brew
but
otherwise
it
goes
down
very
smooth
d
i
like
lots
of
belgian
styles
but
i
never
find
myself
able
to
have
more
than
one
bottle
at
a
time
and
not
solely
because
of
the
abv
however
this
one
bottle
went
down
very
nicely
and
with
some
fanfare
got
some
odd
but
interesting
flavors
in
this
one
pours
a
copper
flavor
with
a
slightly
uninteresting
look
to
the
beer
no
head
to
speak
of
but
it
is
rich
and
full
of
flavor
peaches
and
melons
blend
through
on
this
one
warms
nicely
no
lacing
on
this
one
but
a
terrific
tasting
beer
that
i
recommend
give
this
one
a
try
seems
like
a
good
quadrupel
to
start
out
with
if
youre
new
to
the
style
cheers
dfor
a
strong
quad
this
goes
down
insanely
easy
warms
the
belly
nicely
and
the
flavors
are
so
varied
its
hard
to
put
down
cause
you
need
to
keep
sipping
in
order
to
decipher
them
awesome
beer
appeared
a
lovely
burgundy
color
with
rust
highlights
a
mild
whitecolored
head
with
nice
lacing
left
behind
in
my
goblet
aromas
of
plums
figs
dried
fruit
and
candy
the
taste
was
smooth
and
semicrisp
with
dried
fruit
and
hard
candy
flavors
dominating
somewhat
creamy
texture
with
a
dry
and
slightly
sour
finish
easy
to
sip
but
a
bit
too
rich
sweet
and
alcohol
is
apparent
in
the
taste
a
slightly
bitter
aftertaste
lingers
along
with
a
warming
sensation
in
the
back
of
the
throat
theres
absolutely
nothing
to
dislike
here
as
far
as
i
can
tell
this
american
beer
is
a
kindred
spirit
in
color
aroma
and
taste
to
its
belgian
elders
nice
job
avery
pours
a
light
orange
color
clear
with
little
head
to
speak
of
but
medium
carbonation
smell
is
light
colored
dry
fruit
and
alcohol
taste
is
syrupy
sweet
more
dried
fruit
and
alcohol
heavy
body
aftertaste
is
sweet
and
sticky
coates
the
mouth
surprisingly
easy
to
drink
for
the
high
alcohol
and
heavy
body
not
quite
what
i
want
from
a
quad
but
good
none
the
less
dont
look
for
something
overly
complex
here
and
you
will
be
satisfied
i
think
this
is
a
very
good
beer
worth
looking
for
the
color
is
clear
dark
copper
with
a
small
tan
head
the
nose
has
dark
fruit
candy
belgian
yeast
and
lots
and
lots
of
alcohol
the
flavor
profile
has
a
lot
of
sugary
sweet
malt
fruit
alcohol
it
works
fairly
well
in
this
brew
yeast
pepper
and
tiny
hint
of
hop
bitterness
in
the
background
mouthfeel
is
medium
to
thick
with
good
carbonation
avery
is
going
to
come
out
with
an
english
mild
next
month
itll
be
7
3
abv
the
color
of
the
beer
is
beautiful
dark
cherry
amber
but
there
was
very
little
head
which
promptly
turned
into
no
head
at
all
nor
lace
nor
ring
the
smell
was
sweet
full
of
cherry
wheat
phenols
and
a
lot
of
alcohol
lurking
just
below
the
surface
i
also
caught
a
bit
of
a
nuttly
aftersmell
taste
was
sweet
sweet
sweet
with
a
citrus
cherry
syrup
dominating
its
balanced
alot
more
on
the
front
while
the
middle
and
back
are
almost
oppressively
sweet
i
struggle
to
identify
any
other
taste
sensation
perhaps
hidden
underneath
the
aftertaste
has
again
a
slightly
nutty
bit
to
it
along
with
a
hint
of
smoke
but
was
still
dominantly
sweet
and
alcohol
mouthfeel
was
good
nice
body
up
front
and
plenty
of
tickly
carbonation
running
to
the
back
the
lack
of
complexity
and
the
hefty
alcohol
tag
keep
the
drinkability
down
somewhat
but
altogether
not
too
bad
this
beer
reminded
me
most
of
a
barleywine
as
it
seemed
to
share
a
lot
of
the
same
qualities
its
pretty
much
the
same
color
maybe
a
slight
shade
lighter
very
malty
sweet
nose
i
taste
barleywine
all
over
this
beer
im
not
even
sure
how
id
differentiate
between
the
two
i
drank
this
with
dinner
in
the
hot
july
maryland
summer
and
it
was
not
very
refreshing
avery
baby
yeah
it
is
taste
as
with
the
smell
the
sweetness
really
jumps
out
at
first
with
brown
and
candied
sugar
but
once
it
warms
its
not
quite
as
pronounced
the
fruits
are
there
with
raisins
plums
and
dates
and
finishes
with
a
slightly
subdued
spiciness
alcohol
is
felt
more
than
tasted
but
its
presence
is
there
in
the
background
the
mouthfeel
is
a
bit
on
the
thin
side
for
what
i
would
expect
for
a
quad
with
a
fairly
low
carbonation
drinkability
is
pretty
good
for
the
big
abv
this
beer
had
a
clear
red
tinted
copper
color
with
a
small
light
tan
head
the
smell
is
strongly
phenolic
getting
many
fruits
apple
cherry
orange
and
plum
there
is
a
bit
of
alcohol
in
the
smell
too
the
taste
is
almost
cloying
very
sweet
and
fruity
with
a
spicy
hop
and
alcohol
bite
the
body
is
medium
and
it
ends
pretty
dry
the
alcohol
bite
makes
it
a
slow
sipping
beer
drinkability
this
is
good
goes
down
well
high
abv
is
the
limiting
factor
here
overall
its
interesting
i
do
like
it
though
i
dont
think
it
compares
to
the
great
beers
that
are
in
this
style
but
still
good
quite
sweet
the
score
i
gave
it
is
lower
just
because
of
its
comparison
within
the
style
it
is
a
good
beer
though
full
bodied
fairly
active
carbonation
tingled
the
tongue
d
very
smooth
and
very
drinkable
and
with
a
10
abv
watch
out
for
it
the
ease
of
this
beer
might
go
down
smoothly
but
you
must
watch
out
for
it
because
it
can
grab
you
a
little
harder
then
expected
give
me
more
this
ones
an
awesome
sipper
i
feel
stupid
for
having
left
this
one
on
my
shelf
for
so
long
i
really
should
have
had
this
sooner
its
very
light
for
the
stile
and
very
tasty
more
of
a
sipper
but
at
10
abv
why
not
overall
a
decent
beer
bottle
poured
in
a
chimay
glass
a
clear
medium
copper
color
ale
with
a
small
head
with
minimal
retention
aroma
is
quite
hot
with
alcohol
and
very
sweet
cookie
dough
taste
is
also
dominated
by
the
sweet
cookie
dough
and
some
strong
alcohol
traces
definitely
lacking
complexity
and
the
dry
figsprune
character
that
i
usually
like
to
find
in
a
quadruple
too
sweet
for
its
own
good
alcohol
is
way
too
apparent
and
body
is
too
thin
are
all
characteristics
in
beer
that
i
usually
dont
track
down
and
thats
why
i
wont
be
buying
this
again
update
its
come
to
my
attention
that
i
may
be
confusing
smokiness
with
cloves
i
may
be
tasting
cloves
and
thinking
clove
cigarettes
either
way
its
not
a
taste
i
enjoy
but
i
just
dont
want
to
mislead
anyone
color
is
a
bright
clear
maroon
head
is
of
average
height
and
is
light
brown
aroma
is
of
dark
fruity
malt
with
added
sweet
belgian
sugar
and
just
an
edge
of
spices
initial
taste
is
a
combination
of
dark
fruit
and
candi
sugar
ample
spice
flavor
is
noted
throughout
and
towards
the
middle
of
a
sip
mixes
with
the
belgian
sugar
which
creates
a
cinnimonlike
impression
an
edge
of
alcohol
is
noted
throughout
and
is
wellhidden
at
10
the
finish
is
enjoyably
sweet
and
long
lasting
this
is
a
complex
beer
with
many
layers
of
flavor
to
enjoy
and
is
highly
recommended
this
is
a
tasty
treat
that
i
plan
to
drink
this
again
alcohol
is
well
concealed
fruity
and
complex
with
a
balanced
bitterness
its
amazing
how
easy
this
is
to
drink
while
having
such
a
high
abv
overall
a
very
drinkable
10percent
beer
tasty
and
dangerous
the
reverend
is
my
new
best
friend
this
high
octane
beer
will
hit
you
by
surprise
very
smooth
for
the
high
alcohol
content
10
abv
seeing
the
rev
only
come
in
22
oz
bottles
you
have
to
be
careful
with
hints
of
fruit
and
sweetness
the
brewers
at
avery
sure
have
put
together
a
good
beer
here
maybe
its
all
the
belgium
candy
sugar
they
use
pours
a
translucent
medium
reddened
orange
with
no
head
and
some
islands
of
bubbles
the
carbonation
is
goodsized
and
sodalike
smell
is
somewhat
fruity
woody
and
candyish
but
nothing
is
bold
or
strong
taste
is
quite
smooth
for
such
a
high
abv
beer
there
is
a
thick
rush
of
dark
fruits
and
mellow
alcohol
burn
the
mouthfeel
only
suffers
from
a
bit
too
much
carbonation
pleasing
aperitif
that
should
be
easy
to
quaff
but
beware
the
high
octane
overall
a
very
sweet
and
fruity
drink
although
the
belgian
presence
is
there
it
seems
to
be
a
little
less
polished
as
ive
had
frankly
the
flavor
isnt
as
much
as
a
few
belgian
tripels
ive
had
really
worth
the
try
the
flavor
is
very
sweet
and
fruity
with
a
slight
warming
hint
of
alcohol
the
sweetness
is
candy
sweet
but
it
also
turns
your
mouth
inside
out
from
sourness
i
could
not
finish
this
one
and
had
to
pour
it
out
it
may
be
remincent
of
the
style
but
i
had
to
pour
it
out
copper
currency
rich
doughy
malts
sweetened
fruits
sugars
and
yeast
in
the
aroma
giving
a
hint
of
peanut
butter
and
bubble
gum
perhaps
a
hint
of
herbs
in
the
aroma
as
well
phenolic
and
fairly
subtle
tasting
with
a
light
flavor
overall
considering
its
style
and
potency
as
well
as
several
strange
flavors
including
plastic
bright
spicy
yeast
flavors
with
hints
of
cinnamon
the
flavors
are
not
really
cloying
like
it
is
for
some
folks
but
it
isnt
as
juicy
and
flavorful
as
the
best
quads
overall
it
is
a
quality
beer
as
a
winter
warmer
ale
but
not
a
true
belgian
quadruple
ale
it
could
benefit
from
more
structure
body
layers
of
flavor
and
a
heavier
mouthfeel
to
live
up
to
quality
belgian
ale
it
would
be
best
drank
warm
for
full
effect
with
a
traditional
spiced
dessert
such
as
raisin
bread
or
rice
pudding
this
beer
is
a
tarty
smooth
and
finishes
dry
a
bit
too
sweet
to
be
terribly
drinkable
but
good
for
a
glass
after
a
meal
especially
not
chilled
but
at
room
temperature
jazzbeerdepew
very
drinkable
for
the
abv
a
nice
solid
brew
but
like
alot
of
averys
products
missing
a
certain
something
in
my
opinion
cheers2beers
sharp
tangy
but
just
a
tad
harsh
with
the
alcohol
burn
in
the
aftertaste
perhaps
drinkability
is
on
the
low
side
with
the
high
abv
but
still
a
pleasant
evening
spent
with
the
rev
m
d
mouthfeel
is
good
on
this
offering
from
avery
its
a
full
bodied
strong
abbey
thatll
keep
you
warm
on
a
winters
night
carbonation
is
high
at
first
but
gives
way
to
the
malts
leaving
a
nice
after
taste
in
your
mouth
definately
very
drinkable
i
would
try
this
again
however
this
is
a
very
tasty
beer
well
suited
to
fireside
contemplation
overall
a
bit
sloppy
cant
drink
much
of
this
brew
wishing
i
had
about
3
other
people
to
share
it
with
drinkability
quite
drinkable
actually
pretty
good
example
of
the
style
not
much
heat
and
pretty
flavorful
nice
one
opinion
i
think
that
this
is
a
pretty
good
beer
it
is
a
bit
fruity
for
my
taste
and
i
would
like
it
to
have
a
bit
more
contribution
from
the
malt
than
from
the
yeast
biproducts
it
is
a
clean
and
well
taken
care
of
brew
and
one
that
i
will
surely
drink
again
this
one
would
likely
benefit
from
some
extended
year
of
cold
aging
to
let
the
fruitiness
mellow
and
the
complexity
increase
22
ounce
bottle
the
reverend
pours
out
a
slightly
hazy
amber
color
with
a
small
head
the
aroma
is
sweet
and
malty
with
a
fruit
and
nuttiness
in
the
background
that
reminds
me
of
a
peanut
butter
and
jelly
sandwich
sweet
flavor
with
a
strong
alcohol
component
the
fruity
flavor
is
nearly
cloying
which
is
very
much
unlike
the
better
of
this
beers
belgian
counterparts
theres
a
pleasant
spiciness
in
the
finish
as
well
as
a
moderate
hoppiness
drinkability
is
pretty
good
given
that
this
is
a
10
abv
brew
this
is
not
a
terrible
beer
overall
but
there
arent
many
quadrupels
to
compare
it
to
and
many
of
those
others
are
truly
exceptional
beers
overall
i
like
this
brew
very
strong
in
both
flavor
and
alcohol
but
not
upsetting
clean
tasting
with
a
smooth
mouthfeel
full
bodied
a
very
nice
beer
overall
i
may
have
to
repent
and
visit
the
reverend
at
another
date
in
the
near
future
pretty
drinkable
but
one
is
enough
reminds
me
of
a
turbocharged
doubleopen
your
eyes
give
it
a
try
the
appearance
is
a
clear
copper
body
with
a
medium
tan
head
and
nice
lacing
the
aroma
is
a
sweet
grapefruit
with
slight
alcohol
end
the
creamy
beginning
is
rich
citrusy
fruit
ending
with
a
heavily
carbonated
slight
alcohol
aftertaste
all
in
all
a
wonderful
brew
with
quite
a
kick
the
taste
was
smooth
and
fruity
the
only
drawback
is
the
alcohol
end
and
after
the
first
glass
you
dont
care
the
reverend
is
a
little
less
than
some
of
the
best
quads
out
there
and
that
merits
attention
because
i
can
buy
two
reverends
roughly
for
the
price
of
one
rochefort
10
if
your
in
the
mood
for
several
quads
the
reverend
is
a
best
buy

this
was
crystal
clear
and
amber
with
no
head
nice
sweet
nutty
nose
but
nothing
outstanding
taste
is
malty
and
sweet

kind
of
like
an
eisbock
thick
sweet
strong
slightly
herbal
maybe
this
needs
two
years
to
reach
its
full
potential
and
cut
the
sweetness
i
do
love
the
strength
though
as
it
warms
you
can
appreciate
the
sincere
attempt
at
this
belgian
style
incredibly
drinkable
for
the
style
i
was
quite
impressed
with
this
beer
age
obviously
has
a
lot
to
do
with
this
i
would
be
interested
to
see
how
this
beer
was
fresh
but
with
some
age
on
it
id
have
to
concede
its
one
of
the
best
americanmade
examples
ive
encountered
pours
out
to
a
soild
dark
bronze
color
with
a
small
offwhite
foam
head
medium
low
level
of
carbonation
whisps
of
lace
in
the
glass
aromas
of
bready
yeast
and
dark
rotten
fruit
some
sweet
odors
as
well
taste
has
some
depth
to
it
but
not
enough
to
match
up
to
real
belgians
full
maltiness
sweet
candied
alcohol
some
sweet
grain
and
yeast
alcohol
had
a
highly
warming
quality
interesting
mouthfeel
was
slightly
thick
and
syrupy
but
remained
easily
consumable
a
good
level
of
drinkability
for
the
price
this
is
a
deal
recommended
thanks
mike
this
beer
might
make
a
decent
session
beer
the
alcohol
content
is
a
little
high
but
the
flavor
is
mild
enough
to
make
up
for
that
i
think
this
beer
is
good
i
would
buy
this
one
again
rusty
red
color
no
visible
yeast
sediment
the
aroma
is
brown
sugar
and
a
little
butterscotch
mixed
with
belgian
yeast
smells
the
sugary
presence
also
comes
through
in
the
taste
with
the
brown
sugar
sweetness
playing
a
pretty
big
part
in
this
brew
alcohol
is
very
subdued
and
hidden
behind
the
thick
flavors
the
belgian
yeast
and
native
malts
really
shine
through
here
and
it
was
a
very
tasty
offering
of
a
traditional
belgian
style
the
body
is
big
a
bit
of
a
syrupy
texture
sure
its
a
quad
but
its
is
way
to
hot
even
with
age
i
wonder
how
this
will
blend
in
the
reverand
what
a
great
name
for
a
belgian
quadrupel
tried
this
one
out
at
out
carolina
brewmasters
meeting
tonight
and
was
definitely
impressed
hoppy
yet
not
too
bitter
easy
enough
to
drink
considering
its
high
alcohol
content
great
sparkle
in
the
mouth
22oz
bomber
pours
a
cloudy
copper
color
some
carbonation
small
head
which
leaves
pretty
quick
nice
lacing
though
scents
of
malt
fruit
and
sweetness
the
taste
is
very
sweet
and
kinda
syrupy
medium
body
very
drinkable
for
a
10
abv
brew
this
is
my
first
avery
and
first
quad
i
like
this
brew
alot
very
nice
in
deed
the
alcohol
is
hidden
pretty
well
i
would
highly
recommend
this
to
people
drinkability
this
is
for
sharing
d
this
is
too
sweet
and
syrupy
to
want
to
drink
much
a
belgian
quad
i
guess
basically
it
was
a
big
10
alcohol
beer
without
much
flavor
no
real
belgian
yeast
or
phenol
notes
not
a
whole
lot
of
spice
just
sort
of
alcohol
its
definitely
a
beer
id
recommend
drinking
only
at
room
temp
as
its
1000
times
better
but
basically
a
sad
excuse
for
a
belgian
quad
overall
a
good
purchase
id
definitely
buy
it
again
this
beer
has
a
heavy
malt
aroma
with
some
dough
cherry
and
port
not
as
a
full
aroma
has
many
great
quda
have
the
head
was
fizzy
and
disappeared
in
15
seconds
there
was
no
lacing
body
was
brown
initial
flavor
was
heavily
sweet
with
a
short
finish
hard
to
nail
down
the
texture
only
slightly
syrupy
the
carbonation
was
soft
and
a
difinite
moderate
alcohol
finish
certainly
not
one
of
my
favorite
quads
i
have
another
that
ill
let
staty
in
the
cellar
for
a
year
high
abv
combined
with
high
sweetness
and
high
price

makes
this
one
a
one
and
done
drinkability
for
me
this
has
always
been
a
very
drinkable
beer
the
reverend
is
full
of
first
for
me
this
was
the
first
american
craft
beer
i
experienced
this
was
also
the
first
big
beer
i
drank
further
more
the
reverend
will
always
remind
me
of
my
wife
she
purchased
the
reverend
on
an
impulse
buy
the
flavor
has
the
candi
sugar
sweetness
throughout
with
a
slight
bit
of
dark
fruitiness
and
caramel
malts
it
is
full
bodied
and
warming
it
is
a
bit
on
the
sweet
side
with
an
alcohol
warmth
in
the
finish
this
one
is
pretty
good
just
needs
a
bit
more
depth
drinability
is
good
and
relatively
cheap
for
the
style
something
i
need
to
try
more
of
mouthfeel
heavy
feeling
in
the
pallete
alcohol
coating
in
the
mouth
lightly
carbonated
my
first
quadrupel
pours
a
light
amber
with
a
decent
white
head
the
aroma
of
malt
so
sweet
you
can
taste
it
bannana
citrus
tastes
of
sweet
caramel
malt
and
fruit
with
a
decent
hop
balace
you
can
taste
the
power
of
the
alcohol
but
not
too
overpowering
peachesbannanas
i
already
need
another
these
could
be
addictive
body
is
below
medium
definately
not
up
to
the
standards
of
a
good
quad
mouthfeel
is
slick
and
wet
with
softy
fizzy
carbonation
needs
time
to
mellow
out
still
a
decent
interpretation
of
the
style
pours
a
crystal
clear
amber
with
a
thin
white
head
that
dissapates
quickly
aroma
begins
with
dark
fruits
followed
by
candied
sugar
fruity
ale
esters
toasted
bread
alcohol
and
some
minerals
the
flavor
also
begins
with
dark
fruit
plum
fig
raisin
grape
pear
followed
by
candied
sugar
a
light
spicy
hops
character
some
esters
and
an
alcohol
ridden
finish
the
mouthfeel
is
a
tad
on
the
light
side
and
drinkability
is
greatly
diminished
by
the
alcohol
a
halfway
descent
quad
but
in
this
style
halfway
doesnt
cut
it
but
the
alcohol
is
way
too
aparent
and
in
your
face
which
is
typical
of
some
of
averys
brews
overall
a
nice
belgian
offering
from
avery
if
nothing
else
the
bottle
is
hilarious
definitely
worth
picking
up
especially
for
the
price
the
peachyapricot
flavors
are
really
unique
and
fit
in
nicely
strong
beer
but
a
very
pleasant
sipper
good
to
split
with
a
friend
drinkability
now
that
im
about
halfway
through
the
bottle
some
of
the
sweetness
and
the
alcohol
is
getting
to
me
a
bit
then
again
this
is
a
22
oz
quad
so
maybe
i
shouldve
saved
it
also
for
some
others
still
for
about
5
a
bottle
its
definitely
worth
a
shot
pours
a
reddish
ambermahogany
a
little
cloudy
with
a
nice
white
head
that
succumbs
to
the
10
rather
quickly
smell
was
a
little
funky
for
me
at
first
heavy
on
the
green
olives
and
cloves
dark
fruits
and
alcoholic
vapors
taste
continues
with
the
somewhat
harsh
oliveclove
candied
figs
dates
and
cherries
some
hops
and
kick
you
in
the
teeth
booze
mouthfeel
is
champagne
bubbly
and
rich
it
was
a
little
harsh
at
first
but
definitely
mellowed
out
as
it
warmed
trading
some
of
the
oliveclove
for
candied
fruits
an
interesting
quad
definitely
a
big
beer
here
didnt
blow
my
mind
but
worth
a
try
and
a
good
deal
at
5
for
a
bomber
a
great
beer
and
the
alcohol
is
very
well
hidden
on
both
the
nose
and
the
palate
even
at
warmer
temperatures
drinks
fine
and
easy
enough
but
its
lack
luster
to
say
the
least
and
is
missing
the
complexity
a
quad
should
have
my
6
could
have
been
better
spent
this
is
a
decent
nightcapper
and
a
decent
representation
by
an
american
brewery
but
its
not
very
complex
nor
does
it
carry
any
depth
unfortunately
this
one
runs
into
a
group
of
beers
that
have
potential
to
be
the
greatest
beers
in
the
world
its
like
in
diving
only
certain
dives
can
get
a
perfect
score
well
quads
have
that
potential
and
this
is
rather
pedestrian
dark
browncopeer
color
head
is
large
at
first
but
the
high
abv
quickly
surpresses
it
to
a
thin
white
layer
musty
belgian
yeast
raisins
plums
big
alcohol
and
sweet
brown
sugar
malt
taste
is
full
and
sweet
the
belgian
yeast
adds
a
nice
musty
funk
lots
of
fruitiness
tart
and
bitter
on
the
finish
where
is
the
10
abv
it
is
very
well
hidden
although
you
do
get
a
nice
warming
sensation
from
it
an
excellent
beer
perfect
for
this
septemberseeming
night
in
minnesota
pretty
drinkable
considering
the
abv
but
somewhat
underdeveloped
compared
to
the
best
beers
in
the
category
alcohol
esters
and
hop
bitterness
a
bit
overwhelming
good
attempt
at
an
american
belgian
quads
often
allow
the
alcohol
to
become
harsh
abrupt
and
over
power
all
other
flavors
this
still
happens
with
the
reverend
though
lesser
than
most
even
belgians
this
has
a
big
candied
flavor
on
the
lips
sweet
alcohol
soon
rises
the
spiciness
is
a
bit
overdone
but
the
body
is
nice
and
full
american
hops
decorate
the
body
and
help
to
create
heat
with
the
alcohol
the
alcohol
becomes
too
hot
and
stingy
and
the
sweet
body
gives
way
into
the
finish
reveals
a
bit
of
grainy
and
slickness
ill
have
it
again
its
a
good
attempt
overall
impression
for
an
avery
beer
its
quite
good
flavors
are
clean
and
fresh
the
alcohol
although
substantial
is
well
integrated
it
has
a
nice
belgian
edge
and
a
full
taste
a
sermon
worth
sitting
through
lightly
translucent
but
bright
reddishcolored
brown
decent
yellow
head
of
almost
12
an
inch
in
height
laces
in
dripping
rings
nice
aroma
fruit
infused
honeyish
with
generous
tones
of
vanilla
and
malted
milk
mouthfeel
is
silky
and
more
than
medium
carbonation
is
fine
in
texture
and
wellspaced
starts
very
sweet
almost
toothachingly
so
candied
cherries
and
peach
jelly
predominate
thickens
and
shows
some
underlying
alcohol
toward
the
finish
not
very
yeasty
a
little
too
thick
and
like
a
syrupy
cordial
actually
out
sweetens
latrappes
quad
no
mean
feat
it
stands
out
as
pretty
drinkable
surprisingly
if
you
are
in
the
mood
there
is
a
touch
of
hop
bitterness
late
but
also
something
very
empty
in
the
glass
belgian
quad
the
name
says
it
all
this
beer
poured
a
dark
amber
or
copper
color
with
slight
head
which
didnt
stick
around
too
long
lucky
for
me
the
flavor
did
as
did
the
alcohol
the
scent
was
malty
yeasty
and
sweet
very
very
sweet
the
flavor
followed
that
sweet
scent
the
barley
malts
were
strong
surprisingly
the
flavor
also
showed
some
belgian
hops
they
came
blended
nice
with
the
malted
flavor
the
sugar
was
sweet
but
refreshing
and
the
alcohol
flavor
wasnt
too
powerful
when
all
was
said
and
done
i
found
this
to
be
a
nice
change
of
pace
sweet
malty
with
some
hops
oh
yeah
plus
the
pretty
high
abv
all
in
all
a
great
experience
surprised
i
havent
had
this
one
yet
or
have
i
dark
copper
color
with
a
thick
orangebrown
head
pretty
good
lacing
the
aroma
is
mostly
yeast
along
with
some
grapefruit
and
spice
rich
body
and
despite
not
being
as
complex
or
flavorful
as
the
bestofbreed
in
the
style
it
is
still
enjoyable
for
the
most
part
the
yeast
flavor
is
at
the
forefront
again
with
spice
and
peppery
alcohol
undertones
there
is
a
bit
of
sweet
malt
hiding
in
there
too
the
finish
is
dry
and
spicy
with
a
slow
alcohol
burn
overall
this
is
a
pretty
solid
brew
avery
the
reverend
is
a
fine
interpretation
of
the
belgian
quadrupel
style
its
nice
to
see
american
breweries
trying
to
reflect
the
flavors
of
some
of
the
trappist
beers
and
abbey
ales
though
this
beer
should
not
be
confused
with
those
i
liked
it
and
i
will
definitely
have
to
try
it
again
at
another
time
starts
off
nicely
sweet
not
thick
and
cloying
yeah
it
reminds
me
of
smooth
applesauce
made
from
some
spicy
yellow
apples
theres
a
little
clove
and
cinnamon
vanilla
and
alcohol
a
bit
on
the
strong
side
that
note
not
bad
very
much
like
a
quadstyle
or
american
version
thereof

but
it
just
does
go
down

i
wouldnt

it
high
on

5overall
the
beer
is
mush
less
complex
than
i
expected
and
is
not
very
drinkable
due
to
the
overwhelming
strength
of
alcohol
flavor
present
sulldaddynov

as
it
warmed
it
began
to
taste
better
or
maybe
that
was
due
to
the
fact
that
i
was
getting
pretty
buzzed
anyways
the
head
is
tannish
a
malty
aroma
at
first
and
then
you
get
the
yeast
contributions
yeast
and
strong
alcohol
flavors
do
not
seem

the
beer
poured
a
dark
amber
color
with
a
large
head
that
settled
quickly
the
aroma
was
filled
with
notes
of
caramel
and
alcohol
with
some
malts
as
well
the
flavor
was
surprisingly
smooth
given
the
alcohol
aroma
the
malts
were
present
foremost
in
the
taste
with
the
caramel
being
close
second
not
a
bad
beer
at
all
the
beer
looks
like
i
poured
a
frothy
glass
of
juicy
juice
kinda
cloudy
and
not
too
much
head
im
color
blind
so
i
cant
give
you
much
more
than
that
almost
a
sickly
sweet
smell
and
taste
is
sickly
sweet
too
too
much
sugar
not
enough
carbonation
i
guess
the
only
thing
going
for
it
is
its
high
alcohol
content
i
bought
it
because
is
was
a
quadruple
should
have
realized
that
i
like
dubbels
better
than
tripels
the
quad
is
just
that
much
further
away
from
my
style
preference
i
wont
be
buying
another
one
of
these
drinkability

i
thought
that
this
one
was
a
little
unbalanced
and
went
down
rather
clumsily
the
body
is
medium
and
finishes
fairly
clean
the
high
alcohol
is
fairly
well
hidden
in
the
flavor
profile
but
is
noticable
on
the
nose
very
drinkable
but
a
little
to
sweet
to
have
34
at
a
time
overall
i
feel
this
is
a
well
crafted
ale
i
wanted
more
of
a
balance
it
probably
goes
well
with
a
fine
mild
cigar
i
may
give
that
a
try
one
day
unfortunately
this
will
not
be
a
regular
in
my
fridge
i
enjoyed
it
but
my
expectations
were
just
too
high
this
is
an
absolutely
beautifully
colored
beer
the
pour
created
a
look
that
was
quite
brilliant
and
seemed
to
have
an
inner
glow
quality
to
it
the
very
deep
amber
to
copper
body
was
tinged
with
incredible
red
hues
that
seem
to
intensify
when
brought
to
light
unfortunately
this
lovely
look
was
crowned
by
a
most
minimal
head
appearance
and
only
rudimentary
lace
deposits
the
nose
was
complex
but
was
overwhelmingly
of
caramel
malt
the
first
taste
of
this
beer
provides
an
impressive
bite
that
spills
out
against
the
tongue
as
if
in
assault
quite
warming
yet
masking
its
substantial
alcohol
base
the
flavor
quickly
grows
to
a
very
familiar
state
the
finish
is
nicely
peppery
in
sense
and
gives
a
good
full
mouthfeel

that
goes
away
as
the
beer
or
maybe
the
beer
drinker
warms
the
aftertaste
is
nicely
bready
overall
i
like
this
quite
a
bit
more
than

its
more
deserving
of
the
belgianstyle
in
the
name
too
i
think
for
me
its
a
little
too
sweet
but
otherwise
very
good
imposing
bottle
whose
central
image
is
that
of
a

cutesy

a
touch

bitterness
in
the
aftertaste
hearty
and
robust
and
a
must
try
for
the
bad
boys

in
the
audience
if
you
can
rank
beer
by
the
number
of
times
i
said
omigod
during
its
disappearance
then
this
is
a
ten
a
great
drinking
beer
for
10
abv
and
a
good
belgium
style
quadruppel
i
wasnt
that
impressed
with
this
beer
sweet
and
a
little
spicy
aroma
the
taste
is
very
sweet
and
rich
and
then
fades
to
a
slight
bitterness
the
alcohol
sometimes
is
noticeable
and
sometimes
is
not
not
a
bad
brew
by
any
means
not
exciting
either
try
it
if
yourevery
curious
this
is
a
very
good
brew
well
crafted
with
no
perceptible
off
flavors
but
it
really
needs
some
help
in
the
carbonation
department
to
compete
with
the
native
belgian
quads
im
brewing
a
westy
12
with
wyeast
3787
next
weekend
so
its
refreshing
to
drink
this
and
know
that
it
tastes
nothing
like
westmalle
the
source
of
3787
which
is
think
is
a
horrible
brew
pours
a
reddish
orange
hue
with
a
white
head
smells
like
a
combination
of
yeast
spice
and
candied
sugars
tastes
great
the
smells
i
smelled
i
also
tasted
as
the
beer
warmed
more
flavors
emerged
and
those
present
earlier
became
more
intense
it
may
not
be
filtered
but
i
am
not
a
purist
a
very
tasty
brew
plus
at
10
abv
it
is
very
nice
for
a
cold
winter
evening
pours
a
reddish
mahogany
color
with
a
creamy

that
quickly
dissipates

nose
is
sweet
candied
sugar
dark
sweet
fruit
and
spice
first
sip
is
overpowering
sugar
sweetness
but
soon
fades
as
some
tart
citrus
notes
express
themselves
as
the
beer
warms
flavors
of
molasses
currants
and
dark
cherries
begin
to
come
through
cant
tell
by
the
taste
or
smell
that
its
10
abv
once
you
get
past
the
initial
sweetness
this
is
an
enjoyable
brew
for
being
in
the
belgian
style
i
would
have
thought
this
to
be
slightly
clouded
with
yeast
i
was
dead
wrong
holding
this
beer
up
to
the
light
it
was
a
brilliant
burnt
ornageamber
color
with
the
perfect
12
inch
pearl
small
bubble
head
it
was
so
thick
it
reminded
me
of
a
root
beer
float
the
aroma
at
first
was
of
raosted
malt
citrus
grape
and
bitter
hop
midway
through
it
i
went
back
for
another
smell
before
sip
and
was
totally
caught
off
guard
when
i
smelled
nuts
after
a
few
more
sips
i
decided
to
go
get
a
small
piece
of
cashew
from
downstairs
yup
cashew
interesting
for
the
belgian
style
the
taste
was
of
a
sweet
lingering
malt
alcohol
and
spicy
hop
bitterness
it
had
a
super
dry
finish
which
i
rather
enjoyed
there
was
no
sediment
or
yeast
anywhere
in
the
bottle
another
little
side
weirdness
for
something
that
is
in
the
belgian
style
may
not
be
perfect
to
style
but
i
really
enjoyed
this
interpretation
watch
out
though
you
can
taste
the
alcohol
slightly
but
theres
a
bunch
in
there
thanks
to
txhops
for
the
beer
pours
with
a
clear
copper
body
and
shortlived
head
perhaps
filtered
first
for
a
belgian
i
like
the
presence
of
some
yeast
and
cloudiness
smells
sweet
with
a
hint
of
belgian
yeast
taste
is
rather
simple
when
compared
to
trappists
and
other
abbeys
as
well
as
ommegang
and
allegash
assertive
alcohol
burn
wait
this
is

not
too
bad
in
that
case
other
notes
sweet
a
bit
tart
in
the
midtaste
and
some
yeast
flavor
all
in
all
not
a
bad
interpretation
much
like
my
first
belgian
homebrew
simple
sweet
and
highly
alcoholic
on
the
other
hand
this
is
crystal
clear
whereas
my
brew
was
quite
cloudy
and
opaque
crystal
clear
bronze
hue
covered
by
a
dense
moderately
thick
off
white
head
that
settles
slowly
belgian
lace
is
left
floral
and
spicy
hops
hit
the
nose
at
first
then
are
ensued
by
light
notes
of
peppery

and
mildly
fruity
red
licorice
sweetness
fermentation
byproduct
contributions
in
aroma
are
very
understated
and
consist
only
of
slight
clove
phenol
a
trace
but
pleasant
chalky
note
adds
a
drying
contrast
towards
the
end
of
the
aroma
bright
sugary
sweetness
upfront
in
flavor
is
quickly
countered
by
hop
bitterness
above
the
norm
for
style
and
a
floral
hop
flavor
when
coupled
w
the
sweetness
the
floral
hops
lend
a
perfume
like
character
that
persists
from
start
to
finish
clove
is
slightly
more
assertive
than
than
expected
from
the
aroma
and
provides
a
token
belgian
quality
in
flavor
mid
palate
sweetness
widens
and
becomes
dark
caramel
malt
derived
in
nature
a
touch
thin
in

but
w
sufficient
dextrins
to
help
lend
an
agreeably
smooth

bitterness
has
faded
appreciably
by
the
finish
which
is
mostly
of

sweetness
and

reverend
is
an
odd
and
enjoyable
brew
although
it
lacks
the
complexity
of
many
dark
strongs
and
is
too
clean
all
around
it
is
a
unique
brew
in
itself
the
apparent
filtration
may
have
stripped
flavor
contributions
from
the
yeast
strain

the
floral

profile
and
overall
softness

excellent

very
quaffable
considering
the

with

none
of

mouthfeel
is
a
little
better
catching
the
syrupy
nature
of

pretty
drinkable
for

great

belgian
interpretation
this
beer
poured
a
dark
copper
amber
color
formed
a
white
head
that
didnt
hold
for
very
long
and
left
little
lace
heavy
amount
of
carbonation
common
to
this
style
the
aroma
had
malt
and
some
spice
element
to
it
the
taste
was
malt
and
spice
with
a
slight
hint
of
the
alcohol
it
has
a
medium
body
and
finish
that
just
seemed
to
be
lacking
something
since
i
have
tried
few
of
this
style
review
may
change
in
the
future
only
the
second
quadrupel
ive
tried
weyerbacher
quad
is
the
other
one
i
respect
both
brewers
immensely
for
attempting
the
style
anyway
the
reverend
has
a
deep
orangecopper
color
with
minimal
head
actually
quite
nice
to
look
at
the
smell
is
sweet
somewhat
like
caramelized
orange
with
spicy
hints
of
pepper
very
nice
taste
is
initially
sweet
almost
too
much
so
though
it
gives
way
to
a
citrus
twang
followed
by
a
spicy
alcohol
punch
finishing
with
a
lingering
bittersweet
aftertaste
very
complex
tonight
however
i
was
in
the
mood
for
a
bit
of
complexity
so
this
was
a
really
nice
treat
nice
brew
strong
malty
a
touch
sweet
nice
small
spicy
hop
presence
it
could
have
used
a
little
more
flavor
from
the
yeast
to
amke
it
more
belgiany
but
all
and
all
a
very
tasty
and
very
drinkable
not
sure
what
to
think
about
this
one
the
amber
colored
liquid
had
a
decent
head
that
died
off
with
sweet
malty
aroma
it
tasted
quite
sweet
and
effervescent
with
a
medium
to
strong
malt
body
some
noticeable
alcohol
i
mean
how
can
you
avoid
it
at
10
but
it
was
ok
not
a
beer
for
the
weak
i
may
have
to
drink
another
one
to
pick
up
some
more
stuff
that
i
feel
like
im
missing
glad
i
have
been
able
to
have
this
twice
amazing
i
dont
feel
qualified
to
review
this
but
i
was
fortunate
enough
to
get
a
810and
12
they
were
all
wonderful
burn
a
class
of
their
own
dark
brown
in
color
white
head
tops
it
off
the
head
stay
for
a
spell
and
fades
to
a
thin
ring
fruity
notes
on
the
nose
raisins
figs
and
cherries
come
to
mind
sweet
and
malty
to
start
then
the
fruity
flavors
come
in
to
play
a
bit
bubbly
in
the
mouth
a
very
nice
quad
but
i
think
there
are
better
out
there
definitely
the
best
quad
i
have
ever
had
kind
of
blew
me
away
since
i
figured
it
couldnt
live
up
the
the
hype
and
it
exceeded
fantastic
nose
perfect
mouthfeel
creamy
and
smooth
with
just
the
right
level
of
carb
flavor
is
amazing
rich
plum
raisins
apricot
blend
amazing
beautiful
fluffy
head
dark
brown
malt
and
caramel
aroma
leans
sweet
a
bit
high
carbonation
wise
a
little
smoke
and
spice
with
the
malt
improved
on
warming
one
of
the
best
beers
ever
wonderful
but
i
gotta
say
i
did
this
side
by
side
by
side
with
rochefort
10
and
st
bernardus
12
could
not
tell
a
difference
from
sb12
yes
i
know
why
and
rochefort
10
wins
my
vote
for
the
best
of
the
3
all
great
just
personal
preference
dark
brown
color
with
a
beige
head
aroma
of
dark
fruit
and
spices
taste
is
a
mix
of
dark
fruit
chocolate
spices
and
caramel
the
alcohol
is
also
present
in
the
taste
and
enriches
it
very
good
beer
but
the
rochefort
10
is
slightly
better
in
my
opinion
its
nearly
impossible
to
get
this
beer
but
if
you
somehow
come
across
it
youll
understand
why
there
are
nothing
but
5s
in
my
review
easily
the
best
beer
ive
ever
had
i
even
aged
a
few
and
the
flavors
were
even
more
pronounced
best
beer
in
the
world
hard
to
say
drink
it
with
belgian
chocolate
and
im
sold
dried
fruit
nose
yeast
dark
sugars
pours
brilliant
chestnut
with
a
persistent
moussey
tan
tinted
head
caramel
to
toffee
palate
with
dried
fruit
raisins
honey
dark
bread
faint
anise
and
clove
is
very
creamy
with
some
alcohol
on
the
finish
and
some
light
warming
very
rich
with
above
average
body
and
layers
of
flavor
very
fine
malt
flavors
especially
caramel
and
toffee
very
well
done
well
rounded
and
balanced
some
very
deep
and
interesting
flavors
i
had
the
beer
at
different
locations
and
different
occasions
at

but
the
creamy
smoothness
is
worthy
of
numerous
swirls
and
even
then
youll
be
tempted
to
simply
let
the
beer
sit
on
your
palate
before
saying
good
bye
forever

a
beer
that
surely
lives
up
to
the
massive
reputation
that
precedes
it
i
think
my
favorite
aspect
is
the
wonderfully
complex
so
you
in
turn
do
it
yourself
my
take
is
that
these
belgians
bring
different
things

since
so
much
of
its
aromas
and
flavors
are
released
at
higher
temperatures
even
compared
with
the
other
two
aforementioned
quads
really
glad
i
tried
it

75this
is
a
very
good
beer
i
like
it
old
however
opening
this
beer
fresh
is
a
waste
of
time
and
money
it
is
like
drinking
it
with
only
50
of
its
potential
i
think
i
enjoyed
the
chase
for
this
beer
more
then
actually
drinking
it
it
is
a
very
good
beer
but
not
as
good
as
all
the
hype
i
have
had
it
fresh

you
may
not
like
this
one
on
the
first
taste
but
it
will
quickly
win
you
over
it
has
an
extremely
complex
flavor
i
would
not
say
this
is
a
fruity
beer
but
there
are
fruit
notes

but
very
nice
very
light
mouthfeel
for
such
a
big
o
a
plus
plus
try
one
on
for
size
my
next
trip
to
belgium
will
include
a
stop
at
the
abbey
o
outstanding
very
well
balanced
full
flavored
beer
highly
recommend
it
doesnt
need
to
bash
you
over
the
head
with
sugar
content
hop
content
or
alcohol
content
it
has
the
subtlety
and
restraint
of
a
brewery
whos
level
of
maturity
epitomes
what
it
means
to
be
confident
in
ones
product
o
great
but
so
is
rochefort
12
achel
bruin
and
westmalle
dubbel
i
wouldnt
go
crazy
for
it
but
i
would
surely
try
it
if
you
can
pours
a
very
opaque
dark
brown
you
cant
see
through
this
one
a
finger
of
off
white
head
that
lingers
a
bit
decent
amount
of
sticky
lacing
the
nose
is
well
incredible
there
is
so
much
going
on
a
lot
of
malt
and
dark
fruits
mainly
plum
fig
and
raisin
a
lot
of
pear
sparkling
grape
and
orange
zest
caramel
spice
nutmeg
cloves
and
a
unique
sparkling
winebrandy
combo
the
alcohol
is
present
but
subtle
than
there
is
the
mouth
much
of
the
same
going
on
here
a
huge
malt
backbone
with
a
lot
of
dark
fruits
up
front
that
fade
immediately
into
a
sweet
caramel
almost
creamy
butterscotch
like
flavor
nutmeg
and
cloves
blended
in
perfectly
again
with
that
alcoholwine
mix
followed
with
some
licorice
very
smooth
finish
best
beer
in
the
world
yes
definitely
o
a
delightful
beer
a
lot
of
complexity
in
the
aroma
maybe
one
of
the
best
aromas
on
a
beer
ive
experienced
taste
is
not
quite
on
the
same
level
although
still
very
good
and
satisfying
mouthfeel
is
a
bit
lighter
than
expected
but
helps
bring
this
10
2
to
more
drinkable
levels
glad
i
stumbled
upon
this
and
was
able
to
try
it
overall
this
is
not
only
an
extraordinarily
wellmade
beer
but
really
quintessentially
trappist
i
have
now
sampled
beer
from
every
trappist
brewery
and
i
dont
know
if
it
is
for
better
or
worse
that
most
will
try
this
one
last
because
it
makes
you
realize
what
the
other
breweries
are
aiming
at
it
has
that
semisweet
never
dry
never
cloying
but
teasing
you
with
moments
of
both
lightly
tangy
quality
that
must
surely
come
from
the
sugar
usage
like
all
great
strong
beers
it
is
dangerously
drinkable
and
unlike
so
many
us
big
beers
or
extreme
beers
it
is
not
intense
in
any
regard
really
the
alcohol
comes
on
a
bit
strong
at
times
and
so
it
is
possible
that
aging
this
beer
might
be
wise
but
id
hate
to
lose
the
wonderfully
fresh
malt
and
ester
qualities
that
really
make
it
sparkle
belgian
and
trappist
beer
fans
would
do
well
to
seek
this
out
but
those
looking
to
get
their
minds
blown
by
an
intense
beer
would
do
better
to
spend
their
time
and
money
pursuing
something
stateside
translucent
brown
with
shimmering
ruby
hues
and
a
thick
tightlylaced
creamy
sticky
head
above
similar
aroma
as
the
other
westys
a
complex
deep
malted
nose
of
carob
toffee
and
honey
massive
creamy
buildup
on
the
palate
as
the
tight
carbonation
hits
the
warmth
of
the
mouth
silky
smooth
with
a
dry
medium
even
body
again
with
the
powdery
feel
interesting
twang
of
grapes
dextrin
sweetness
more
carob
golden
syrup
blossom
honey
toffee
medicinal
phenols
anise
ginger
boozesoaked
golden
raisins
raw
candi
sugar
and
a
watery
slightly
fruity
currant
character
alcohol
on
this
one
is
quite
boozy
and
warming
bonedry
powdery
with
a
residual
cocoa
character
and
alcohol
breath
o
best
beer
in
the
world
i
am
really
enjoying
this
beer
and
would
never
turn
a
bottle
down
however
i
will
not
go
out
of
my
way
to
have
another
far
too
many
other
great
beers
available
for
less
effort
o
must
have
beer
and
a
rating
is
deserved
beer
features
a
body
of
medium
weight
with
carbonation
of
mediumlow
intensity
resulting
in
a
very
soft
foamy
mouthfeel
that
would
complement
any
beer
quite
well
ethanol
is
felt
on
the
nostrils
tongue
and
back
of
the
throat
but
only
in
a
marginal
way
surprising
for
a
10
abv
beer
closes
quite
dry
with
substantial
stickiness
on
the
palate
and
lips
bring
on
the
roasts
and
lamb
overall
this
is
delightful
way
too
expensive
for
regular
enjoyment
but
great
for
special
occasions
or
needed
moments
of
joy
o
i
love
rochefort
10
and
this
i
have
to
say
is
a
bit
better
it
easily
was
the
winner
in
a
side
by
side
with
rochefort
and
st
bernardus
abt
12
this
is
a
beer
i
would
drop
some
serious
coin
on
to
get
again
and
a
big
thanks
tot
he
distributor
who
hooked
me
with
a
bottle
a
deep
brown
pour
with
2
fingers
of
offwhite
head
which
diminished
slowly
and
gave
off
great
amounts
of
lacing
aromas
of
dark
roasted
grains
molasses
bready
yeast
dark
fruits
plumraisins
chocolate
the
flavor
is
much
like
the
aroma
except
there
is
a
nice
warmth
from
the
abv
lots
of
bready
chocolate
almost
rye
notes
lots
of
dark
fruit
flavor
as
well
as
far
as
quads
go
this
is
great
not
too
sweet
and
right
up
my
alley
as
far
as
considering
this
the
best
beer
in
the
world
or
whatever
meh
its
just
not
what
i
would
consider
not
even
the
style
really
full
body
with
modest
amount
of
carbonation
a
nice
warming
feeling
from
the
alochol
now
that
the
shock
has
worn
off
ill
explain
even
though
it
adds
to
the
complexity
and
doesnt
disturb
the
balance
i
dont
particularly
care
for
all
the
spiciness
for
me
it
gets
in
the
way
of
the
sweet
rich
dessertlike
qualities
of
the
beer
some
bas
will
disagree
but
thats
just
my
palate
also
i
definitely
taste
the
similarities
between
this
and
st
bernardus
abt
12
although
this
one
is
a
little
spicier
anything
else
oh
yeah
highly
highly
recommended
every
ba
try
this
at
least
once
if
at
all
possible
overall
ill
try
to
keep
this
short
it
lives
up
to
the
hype
honestly
i
had
the
mindset
that
there
really
couldnt
be
a
much
better
quad
than
a
rochefort
10
or
a
st
bernardus
abt
12
but
all
hype
aside
this
is
the
better
beer
i
would
love
to
do
a
blind
test
just
to
make
sure
this
one
is
so
much
lighter
in
feel
but
without
sacrificing
flavor
or
anything
for
that
matter
it
seems
to
emphasize
the
bready
biscuity
characteristics
instead
of
being
dark
fruit
dominant
like
other
quads
and
i
guess
you
can
attribute
it
to
the
stellar
brewing
craftsmanship
of
the
monks
but
the
alcohol
in
this
is
even
less
apparent
you
could
almost
think
you
were
drinking
a
trippel
throughly
impressed
waiting
to
try
my
3rd
one
and
hopefully
the
others
once
i
make
it
out
to
belgium
again
bottle
thanks
to
zathrus13
i
cant
add
anything
the
other
1783
raters
didnt
already
cover
i
would
like
to
say
that
i
am
pleasantly
surprised
with
the
complexity
of
this
ale
i
am
really
diggin
the
dark
fruits
fig
plum
raisin
spices
alcohol
and
belgian
candies
oh
brother
i
need
to
fly
to
belgium
and
spend
a
week
or
two
defiling
my
liver
cheers
finishes
with
waves
of
sweet
dark
malt
apricot
brandy
and
the
quintessential
trappist
funk
while
it
seems
sinful
to
imbibe
more
than
one
westy
12
in
a
session
i
could
imagine
drinking
3
maximum
before
the
sweetness
becomes
overpowering
i
waited
too
long
to
drink
this
masterpiece
but
even
in
its
ripe
old
age
the
beer
is
exquisite
and
deserves
the
praise
it
receives
34

holy

this
is

goddamn
goooood
from

pours
a
deep
amber
color
with
a
big
rocky
head
aromas
of
figs
plums
candi
sugar
dark

and

the
palate
is

fine
carbonation
and
flavors
of

plum

spice
and
some
caramel
finishes
semi
dry
and
not
overly
sticky
well
balanced
worth
a
try
for
sure
lucky
enough
to
be
in
belgium
during
the
time
of
this
review
but
the
vintage
bottle
still
broke
the
bank
i
like
them
both
but
prefer
it
with
age
my
guess
would
be
that
four
years
somewhere
in
the
middle
of
these
two
vintages
could
be
perfection
taking
a
couple
fresh
bottles
home
with
me
time
will
tell
well
i
went
into
this
one
with
high
expectations
this
past
fathers
day
as
i
had
this
with
my
dad
as
his
gift
my
straight
honest
opinion
was
this
was
not
the
best
trappist
beer
ive
ever
had
the
dark
fruits
and
spicy
notes
came
through
fully
but
did
not
floor
me
as
the
best
beer
in
the
world
the
hype
definitely
comes
from
its
limited
availability
methinks
im
torn
on
this
review
i
believe
a
beer
should
be
nearing
high
marks
even
if
it
requires
age
at
a
year
i
however
have
been
told
3
years
is
where
this
one
needs
to
be
i
just
cant
justify
not
marking
a
beer
off
for
wanting
3
years
of
cellaring
to
drink
that
said
this
is
complex
as
hell
the
flavors
are
well
balanced
and
well
put
together
with
that
said
its
not
for
me
the
flavors
will
mellow
and
blend
more
but
the
end
result
will
still
be
a
beer
thats
too
sugary
and
has
spices
that
i
can
pass
on
o
this
is
the
mother
of
all
quads
the
standard
set
by
westy
is
impeccable
at
the
end
of
it
all
youre
left
with
a
beautiful
toasty
to
borderline
malty
after
taste
licking
your
lips
o
best
beer
in
the
world
hard
to
say
best
ive
ever
had
yes
in
fact
other
beers
are
considered
the
1
beer
in
the
world
just
to
keep
this
beautiful
brew
out
of
the
top
slot
very
single
year
but
look
it
up
its
true
and
frankly
the
monks
dont
care
what
we
think
weve
been
lucky
to
get
our
hands
on
quite
a
stash
so
my
dear
friend
is
cellaring
some
for
135
7
years
should
be
a
good
decade
cheers
malty
dark
sweet
and
lingering
ending
that
absolutely
invited
another
drink
and
then
another
i
did
a
side
by
side
comparison
with
st
bernardus
abt
12
and
it
was
then
that
the
complexity
of
the
westy
really
shined
the
st
b
seemed
almost
thin
compared
to
the
rich
flavors
of
the
westy
its
a
contemplative
beer
that
invites
a
slow
enjoyment
itd
be
heaven
with
roast
fowl
and
autumn
chill
overall
i
like
this
really
happy
i
was
able
to
try
it
but
ultimately
i
do
think
i
like
rochefort
10
the
most
of
the
big
quads
ill
have
to
pick
up
another
one
of
those
to
try
again
and
determine
regardless
this
one
really
surprised
me
with
the
slight
funk
and
sour
fruit
notes
alongside
the
normal
quad
flavors
a
great
beer
o
very
different
from
how
i
remember
this
one
from
years
ago
i
remember
noting
how
the
alcohol
was
completely
hidden
but
in
this
one
there
is
a
lot
of
alcohol
phenols
in
the
aroma
and
aftertaste
having
said
that
this
is
easily
the
best
quad
ive
had
very
nice
flavors
all
integrated
with
each
other
balance
is
excellent
drinkability
is
excellent
i
look
forward
to
rereviewing
an
aged
bottle
at
some
point
i
feel
like
this
one
might
be
too
green
given
the
alcohol
harshness
so
so
complex
and
layered
as
it
sits
more
flavors
emerge
and
the
complexity
evolves
like
an
evolutionary
organism
right
in
my
glass
i
really
enjoyed
this
beer
and
i
think
my
expectations
were
in
check
almost
feels
like
some
people
expect
it
to
be
something
better
than
beer
this
is
world
class
stuff
and
i
am
glad
to
check
it
off
the
list
now
i
can
go
back
to
my
abt
12
knowing
that
it
stacks
up
to
westy
quite
favorably
a
thick
craggy
head
that
held
for
a
minute
before
dropping
into
a
oozing
layer
of
foam
leaving
a
few
sticky
spots
on
the
side
of
the
glass

all
around
an

one
everyone
should
try
at

once
in
their
lifetime
4
50
the
worst
part
was
the
3
hr
train
ride
back
to
amsterdam
but
at
least
i
got
to
try
it
and
keep
the
bottle
cap
o
some
of
these
authentic
trappist
ales
make
me
think
to
myself
that
if
i
didnt
have
2
beautiful
little
boys
at
home
id
move
to
belgium
and
take
up
a
life
of
prayer
a
life
of
work
and
a
life
in
a
community
while
wearing
wool
robes
just
as
long
as
i
got
to
drink
stuff
like
this
everyday
but
hey
i
wouldnt
trade
my
family
for
anything
so
i
quickly
come
back
to
reality
anyway
this
is
the
god
father
of
all
the
trappist
brews
and
the
king
of
fine
belgian
ales
in
general
it
has
a
rep
thats
nearly
unmatched
and
often
great
trappist
brews
are
overlooked
due
to
the
mystery
and
the
need
to
know
that
comes
with
the
westy
12
its
definitely
one
of
the
best
crafted
brews
on
the
planet
but
arent
all
trappist
ales
its
the
worlds
best
quad
but
is
it
that
much
better
than
the
rochefort
10
yes
to
me
it
is
but
its
not
on
a
whole
different
level
both
are
in
that
top
tier
of
best
quads
what
the
westy
12
does
offer
are
flavors
no
other
quad
provide
and
an
experience
every
craft
beer
lover
deserves
to
have
in
fact
an
experience
everyone
deserves
to
have
over
and
over
again
its
a
shame
this
thing
isnt
easier
to
get
ahold
of
bc
its
easily
not
only
one
of
the
best
ive
ever
had
but
would
be
one
of
my
favorites
to
pick
up
throughout
every
year
ill
definitely
be
paying
close
attention
for
my
next
experience
of
this
belgian
gem
overall
incredible
quad
one
of
the
best
beers
i
have
ever
had
i
thought
it
was
all
hype
and
came
in
with
a
jaundiced
eye
but
this
one
really
blew
me
away
which
was
an
incredibly
nice
surprise
its
not
that
the
specific
flavours
in
this
beer
were
especially
great
compared
to
other
quads
that
ive
had
but
it
all
came
together
incredibly
well
i
think
thats
the
difference
between
this
beer
and
all
the
others
4
75
did
not
score
a
t
s
m
at
that
time
disregard
those
scores
overall
impression
this
is
the
quad
to
end
all
quads
an
immediate
dark
fruit
punch
in
the
mouth
with
slowly
developing
dark
malt
and
yeast
character
that
somehow
manages
to
stay
medium
bodied
and
a
slightly
dry
finish
although
it
is
very
similar
in
taste
to
most
well
made
quads
its
nimble
body
and
drying
finish
take
the
westy
xii
to
another
level
this
is
a
malt
bomb
that
is
amazingly
drinkable
it
seems
there
are
a
lot
of
beers
in
the
top
of
the
list
thatve
climbed
by
inertia
especially
the
top
beer
this
isnt
one
of
them
a
couple
hundred
years
of
trial
and
error
coupled
by
the
fact
that
the
brewers
dont
make
a
profit
at
least
monetarily
speaking
makes
this
one
of
the
most
interesting
and
satisfying
experiences
you
can
have
imbibing
a
brew
overall
amazingly
well
balanced
mix
of
booze
toastyness
caramel
and
mouthfeel
historic
time
tested
brew
at
its
finest
compared
side
by
side
with
the
5
and
the
8
this
was
easily
my
favorite
and
i
happily
ordered
a
second
round
well
worth
the
trip
o
i
was
less
than
impressed
with
this
bottle
there
are
a
lot
of
easiertoget
trappist
quads
that
are
better
than
this
picked
up
a
bottle
in
a
swap
for
some
bt
last
year
split
it
with
the
wife
pouring
into
a
pair
of
tulips
it
fizzed
up
quite
a
bit
like
a
soda
and
then
quickly
dissipated
into
a
thin
head
with
a
rich
deep
caramel
color
base
the
nose
was
perfectly
sweet
with
strong
notes
of
candied
figs
and
dates
for
a
quad
i
was
surprised
at
how
mellow
and
sweet
it
was
rather
than
dark
and
powerful
i
thought
it
was
really
drinkable
for
a
10
and
could
easily
put
down
more
than
one
bottle
if
afforded
the
opportunity
the
alcohol
was
warm
but
not
overpowering
it
had
a
bold
feel
but
not
chokingly
strong
again
mellow
was
the
word
i
kept
thinking
of
with
a
bit
of
a
sticky
finality
that
i
think
was
more
in
my
head
from
the
fruit
smelltaste
than
actually
having
me
smacking
my
lips
overall
i
was
afraid
after
all
the
hype
i
would
be
slightly
disappointed
but
it
was
actually
the
opposite
i
was
even
more
impressed
with
this
than
i
hoped
i
could
be
absolutely
worth
going
out
of
your
way
to
enjoy
overall
i
was
quite
impressed
with
this
it
was
far
less
sweet
than
i
expected
and
that
was
quite
welcoming
the
apple
was
quite
nice
too
im
quite
glad
that
i
tried
this
i
didnt
expect
it
to
live
up
to
the
hype
but
its
the
best
quad
ive
had
to
date
it
even
makes
me
optimistic
about
trying
quads
again
ohype
notwithstanding
i
was
blown
away
by
how
complex
and
pleasing
the
flavors
were
in
this
beer
i
know
there
is
some
debate
about
whether
this
brew
is
really
better
than
rochefort
or
st
bernardus
or
de
struise
or
whatever
but
for
me
it
really
hits
all
the
sweet
spots
i
mean
that
literally
and
figuratively
because
the
beer
really
is
quite
sweet
but
unlike
some
others
i
did
not
feel
this
was
cloying
or
syrupy
this
is
a
very
good
beer
but
i
feel
that
it
is
wildly
overrated
based
on
it
limited
availability
maybe
i
should
have
let
it
sit
longer
but
i
feel
like
it
should
be
good
fresh
as
well
considering
all
the
hype
surrounding
it
a
pretty
big
letdown
but
i
guess
my
expectations
were
quite
high
i
i
compared
this
to
abt
12
which
i
found
to
be
superior
wow
i
couldnt
believe
i
ran
into
a
bottle
of
this
i
am
by
far
not
as
big
a
beer
snob
as
some
of
you
but
i
love
to
try
and
share
beer
when
i
get
it
this
beer
goes
beyond
complex
each
and
every
sip
i
took
i
got
a
different
experience
of
flavors
the
owner
of
the
place
i
got
it
from
took
out
a
bottle
poured
it
into
a
westy12
glass
and
the
head
just
kept
on
going
thru
the
tip
of
the
glass
and
staying
there
took
a
frew
big
deep
breaths
into
my
nose
and
trying
to
get
a
hint
of
anything
going
on
off
the
top
of
the
glass
sipped
it
took
a
bigger
sip
and
let
it
sit
in
my
mouth
trying
to
get
some
of
the
initial
tastes
on
its
own
westvleteren
12
is
an
excellent
beer
if
youre
not
at
in
de
vrede
its
a
bit
of
work
to
track
down
a
bottle
even
at
bottle
shops
in
brussels
everyone
shoud
try
this
beer
at
least
once
o
this
is
a
superior
beer
i
hemmed
and
hawed
as
to
whether
i
should
actually
pay
the
price
for
this
and
in
the
end
it
was
well
worth
it
and
quite
reasonable
considering
i
prefer
belgian
quads
and
tripels
so
to
me
this
is
like
nirvana
what
was
surprising
and
pleasant
was
the
complexity
of
the
smelltaste
the
fruitiness
hid
the
yeast
and
the
alcohol
stayed
in
the
background
until
the
end
ive
had
rochefort
10
and
st
bernardus
abt
12
and
westvleteren
just
reaches
above
those
making
it
well
worth
the
chase
i
went
in
expecting
it
to
not
meet
up
to
the
hype
but
it
actually
almost
does
im
a
big
fan
of
belgian
dark
ales
and
this
might
actually
top
st
bernardus
abt
12
and
rochefort
10
for
me
incredible
beer
o
i
drank
the
three
other
quads
referenced
in
this
review
within
9
days
of
finally
drinking
this
one
and
ill
admit
i
struggle
to
separate
my
review
from
the
beers
mystique
to
be
honest
i
like
the
other
three
better
however
i
thoroughly
enjoyed
westy
12
with
some
slices
of
a
very
buttery
brie
cheese
like
i
said
i
think
the
magic
of
quadrupels
comes
in
the
aging
so
ill
write
again
in
a
few
years
this
was
a
very
good
beer
it
didnt
live
up
to
my
expectations
but
still
very
good
it
had
a
surprising
complexity
that
i
wasnt
expecting
appearance
was
average
to
normal
compared
to
other
quads
it
had
an
earthy
feeling
dank
mushroomy
taste
and
smell
very
drinkable
for
a
quad
dont
recall
ever
having
liked
this
as
much
as
i
like
this
sampling
i
always
seemed
to
prefer
the
8
out
of
the
westvleteren
brews
but
this
is
helping
change
my
mind
not
a
big
fan
of
quads
but
this
is
very
well
done
and
so
well
integrated
i
will
add
that
i
was
at
the
abbey
today
and
ordered
one
at
the
tavern
right
across
the
way
owned
and
operated
by
the
abbey
they
serve
it
very
cold
which
i
personally
like
and
recommend
for
any
beer
however
i
noticed
that
this
beer
has
more
taste
dimensions
when
served
at
cellar
temperatures
if
you
have
more
than
one
to
try
then
savour
it
at
cellar
temp
and
see
if
you
agree
at
long
long
last
i
finally
got
my
chance
to
try
this
beauty
a
friend
of
a
friend
lucked
out
when
it
came
to
the
states
shared
a
bottle
and
i
was
invited
the
anticipation
was
obviously
huge
here
and
the
beer
met
all
expectations
this
pours
a
lighter
brown
color
with
plenty
of
fish
food
yeast
floaters
and
maybe
a
finger
or
two
of
tan
airy
froth
the
nose
is
remarkably
complex
lots
of
interesting
dried
fruits
and
that
classic
belgian
yeast
it
also
smells
pretty
sweet
like
brown
sugar
or
molasses
and
just
a
clue
about
its
strength
the
flavor
immediately
reminds
me
of
ramadan
dried
figs
and
dates
raisins
and
bready
yeast
its
got
a
lovely
buttery
component
and
seems
somehow
understated
compared
to
what
my
palates
definition
of
a
quad
is
recognizing
of
course
that
this
is
the
quad
of
quads
and
this
is
a
personal
definitional
problem
rather
than
a
shortcoming
of
this
particular
brew
its
layered
and
refined
and
dangerously
drinkable
the
body
is
light
still
medium
probably
but
it
doesnt
feel
heavy
or
sticky
or
filling
at
all
the
carbonation
is
ultra
bright
and
the
flavors
come
one
after
the
other
throughout
the
entire
drink
until
well
after
the
swallow
this
beer
is
famous
and
renowned
for
a
reason
it
is
of
the
highest
quality
i
am
maybe
most
impressed
by
how
well
the
alcohol
is
hidden
one
would
never
know
this
beer
is
so
strong
one
of
those
rare
moments
when
you
feel
a
connection
with
people
you
have
never
and
may
never
meet
this
beer
is
like
a
brotherhood
of
sorts
and
i
am
humbled
and
honored
to
be
a
part
of
it
now
o
i
love
quads
but
this
is
probably
the
most
overrated
one
ive
ever
had
maybe
i
should
have
let
it
sit
longer
but
i
feel
like
it
should
be
good
fresh
as
well
considering
all
the
hype
surrounding
it
a
pretty
big
letdown
but
i
guess
my
expectations
were
quite
high
either
way
definitely
not
worth
the
money
overall
quads
are
a
hit
or
miss
with
me
but
this
is
hands
down
the
best
quad
ive
had
truly
a
beautiful
beer
this
certainly
lives
up
to
the
hype
just
sweet
enough
with
the
perfect
balance
of
flavors
and
not
a
hint
of
alcohol
after
the
smell
glad
to
finally
try
this
and
would
happily
welcome
another
this
beer
absolutely
lives
up
to
the
hype
and
perhaps
even
exceeds
my
expectations
a
picture
of
this
beer
should
appear
next
to
the
definition
for
world
class
in
the
dictionary
absolutely
a
worthwhile
experience
if
you
have
the
opportunity
to
try
this
beer
take
it
while
i
am
sure
some
will
still
find
it
overrated
i
feel
most
will
certainly
not
be
disappointed
o
this
is
one
tasty
quad
and
it
certainly
lives
up
to
the
hype
insanely
drinkable
which
i
would
imagine
would
only
improve
with
time
the
high
abv
is
incredibly
well
hidden
amongst
a
complex
flavour
profile
not
only
was
this
an
incredible
brew
it
made
for
the
perfect
drink
to
celebrate
such
an
incredible
moment
thank
for
sending
this
treat
along
joe
honestly
if
it
wasnt
fot
the
whole
westie
thang
i
would
put
a
beer
like
rochefort
10
way
ahead
of
this
in
no
way
is
this
bad
it
is
in
fact
very
good
but
worldclass
not
for
me
oa
great
beer
to
be
savored
and
sipped
slowly
time
to
move
on
from
the
blond
and
the
dubbel
and
hit
up
the
quad
i
drove
out
to
the
middle
of
nowhere
to
try
notes
from
tasting
fresh
at
the
brewery
in
dec
2010
bottle
cap
reads

poured
the
bottle
into
the
westvleteren
chalice
this
beer
has
a
thick
tight
tan
head
that
has
some
staying
power
and
laces
the
glass
dark
brown
to
black
on
top
lighter

noted
towards
the
thin

aromas
are
toasted
barley
malt
with
a
chocolate
characteristic
great
mouthfeel
complex
very
smooth
with
the
alcohol
hidden
amongst
all
the
other
flavors
super
drinkable
for
such
a
high
abv
beverage
the
complexity
of
this
beer
is
quite
great
this
is
definitely
the
best
of
the
3
beers
compared
to
the
other
great
quads
of
belgium
id
put
this
one
in
the
world
class
category
but
a
notch
below
st
benardus
abt
12
given
slightly
less
estery
goodness
and
the
price
and
availability
issue
well
now
that
im
here
i
better
have
another
i
might
never
get
another
overall
this
beer
has
been
on
my
radar
for
a
very
long
time
and
i
am
pleased
to
say
that
i
was
not
let
down
this
is
a
wonderful
beer
i
absolutely
love
this
beer
ps
i
drank
the
thick
sludge
on
the
bottom
of
the
bottle
and
this
was
definitely
the
yeast
residue
it
tasted
horrible
penicillinlike
bitterness
the
floaties
must
have
been
entirely
tasteless
malt
protein
o
great
complexity
to
the
aromas
and
flavors
make
this
a
world
class
beer
it
is
easy
to
drink
and
enjoyable
i
would
gladly
have
another
one
of
these
in
the
sitting
the
alcohol
is
not
completely
hidden
but
it
is
not
overwhelming
and
there
is
sweetness
but
not
cloyingly
so
was
this
a
world
class
complex
easy
drinking
belgian
absolutely
yes
was
it
the
best
beer
in
the
world
thats
debatable
i
could
see
it
holding
that
title
a
few
years
back
but
now
that
it
has
competitors
with
similar
if
not
better
taste
profiles
i
think
not
dont
get
me
wrong
this
beer
was
amazing
anyone
who
has
access
to
it
needs
to
try
it
at
least
once
but
its
price
and
rarity
are
a
sky
high
and
if
you
cant
get
a
hold
of
one
dont
lose
sleep
over
it
o
overall
certainly
one
of
the
best
beers
ive
had
poured
from
the
typical
plain
brown
glass
bottle
into
a
wine
glass
first
thing
i
noticed
is
a
white
soapy
head
floating
on
a
beautiful
dark
amber
liquid
great
subtle
smell
with
lots
of
dried
fruits
and
a
bit
of
alcohol
the
taste
is
very
niceslightly
dank
with
more
fruits
and
a
touch
of
sweetness
the
real
strength
of
this
beer
is
the
mouthfeel
in
my
opinionsupersoft
and
almost
creamy
wellbalanced
overall
this
is
one
of
my
new
favorites
too
bad
its
so
pricy
and
hardtoget
i
dropped
some
cash
and
purchased
some
of
this
from
a
reputably
shop
online
and
was
really
happy
with
my
purchase
some
could
say
that
it
was
a
bucket
list
next
to
actually
visting
the
brewery
to
buy
my
own
case
dark
appearance
with
a
bit
of
suspended
yeast
malty
malty
taste
and
minimal
hops
truly
a
great
beer
from
the
westy
lads
o
the
smell
of
this
beer
was
fantastic
it
really
opens
up
i
found
the
taste
was
not
near
as
good
as
the
aroma
great
beer
but
i
hope
it
improves
more
with
age
i
still
have
8
bottles
left
from
the
big
blow
out
late
last
year
i
would
take
a
rochefort
10
over
this
any
day
but
i
hope
some
older
bottles
will
change
my
mind
overall
this
is
a
truly
beautiful
beer
the
pleasant
dark
fruit
bite
reminds
me
of
the
westmalle
dubbel
which
isnt
surprising
considering
they
share
the
same
yeast
or
so
ive
heard
im
not
on
the
bandwagon
of
westvleteren
12
best
beer
in
the
world
but
i
will
say
it
surely
is
one
of
the
greatest
it
is
delicately
crafted
and
a
real
treat
to
the
taste
buds
o
doesnt
disappoint
outstanding
nose
and
incredible
integration
and
balance
on
the
flavor
profile
the
best
quad
ive
had
to
date
o
this
beer
didnt
disappoint
great
aromas
and
complex
flavors
o
i
dont
think
ill
be
seeking
this
expensive
brew
out
in
the
future
but
its
definitely
right
up
there
with
the
best
of
them
i
will
proverbially
ask
is
it
the
best
beer
in
the
world
the
answer
is
clearly
a
subjective
no
but
its
something
to
seek

beers
ive
ever
tried
the
drinkability
is
off
the
charts
and
i
really
wish
i
could
say
i
had
more
than
just
the
one
bottle
that
i
tried
i
think
its
absolutely
worth
every
penny
and
if
i
ever
make
it
over
to
belgium
ill
be
making
my
way
over
to
the
abbey
of
saint
sixtus

and
maybe
a
couple
extras
to
save
for

occasions

and
undeniably
puts
it
far

from
the

with
it
being
so
rare
and
no

a
benchmark
example
of
the
style
if
you
love
beer
but
certainly
the
standard
when
it
comes
to
belgian

o
this
is
a
pretty
enjoyable
beer
its
fairly
complex
easy
to
drink
and
it
hides
the
alcohol
well
im
glad
i
got
to
try
it
but
i
wouldnt
put
forth
the
effort
to
get
another
bottle
its
not
one
id
wait
in
line
for
enjoye
o
this
is
a
solid
solid
beer
i
am
very
glad
to
have
tried
it
and
the
taste
really
is
world
class
some
of
the
subtleties
of
this
beer
just
cant
be
found
anywhere
else
with
that
being
said
i
dont
think
i
would
constantly
hunt
this
beer
down
or
seek
it
out
given
another
chance
i
would
love
to
drink
it
but
the
money
and
effort
are
at
the
far
end
of
my
tolerance
for
acquiring
beer
when
something
like
st
bernadaus
12
or
chimay
12
is
readily
available
with
all
of
that
said
i
would
still
have
to
concur
that
this
is
the
king
of
belgian
beer
o
so
this
is
westvleteren
12
perhaps
the
most
elusive
and
highly
rated
beer
on
the
planet
i
must
say
its
reputation
is
certainly
deserved
this
beer
is
a
work
of
seamless
balance
and
grand
complexity
it
just
feels
more
focused
and
more
refined
than
any
other
beer
within
the
style
and
it
may
well
be
the
most
drinkable
beer
of
its
size
there
are
those
within
the
style
that
draw
very
close
comparisons
and
some
may
even
have
a
slight
edge
in
terms
of
complexity
and
depth
of
flavor
however
its
the
balance
and
sheer
drinkability
that
set
westvleteren
12
apart
and
make
it
worthy
of
its
place
among
the
worlds
elite
beers
o
this
beer
was
consumed
in
about
ten
minutes
even
while
reviewing
it
just
went
down
so
quickly
even
while
picking
out
all
the
complexities
present
this
is
a
complex
yet
quaffable
beer
that
begs
you
to
keep
drinking
more
good
thing
i
have
three
more
on
order
thanks
matt
for
the
bottle
share
in
the
nose
i
oddly
get
almost
a
hefeweisse
yeast
slight
banana
and
clove
bakers
chocolate
bready
malts
and
carob
as
well
thick
rich
and
lush
on
the
palate
bring
the
flavors
on
the
nose
with
a
dry
almost
earthy
finish
very
complex
stuff
that
i
am
not
equipped
to
describe
beautiful
head
with
a
ruby
tinted
hue
on
the
basic
quad
brown
color
very
excited
to
try
this
and
an
excellent
beer
but
not
close
to
the
best
i
have
had
bottle
was
a
usa
export
received
from
ibrew2or3
in
a
trade
thanks
man
looks
to
be
one
of
the
brick
box
ones
that
were
sent
to
the
u
s
given
the
gold
writing
on
the
bottle
having
this
as
i
brew
my
first
beer
ever
hoping
that
i
will
get
some
good
vibes
in
my
wort
pours
deep
murky
brown
with
fluffy
light
kahki
head
a
bit
of
reddish
hue
on
the
edges
smells
of
figs
plums
pears
raisin
light
alcohol
bit
of
bready
nuttiness
flavor
is
slight
bitter
up
front
that
explodes
into
chocolatey
fig
and
white
grape
some
nutty
bite
going
on
as
it
mellows
into
a
fruity
sweetness
more
carbonation
than
i
expected
but
still
chewey
mouthfeel
lasting
bouquet
of
fruit
so
glad
i
got
to
try
it
o
very
great
beer
it
actually
came
in
third
for
our
test
but
it
was
still
amazing
and
worth
it
i
cant
wait
to
pop
open
my
other
bottles
in
a
few
years
o
very
drinkable
nice
complexity
its
excellence
is
not
in
being
barrel
aged
loaded
with
hops
or
14
but
in
a
superb
balance
and
flavor
like
the
smell
there
is
a
sweet
dessert
wine
flavor
a
sweet
hint
of
alcoholic
heat
and
deep
candied
figs
and
apricots
the
carbonation
lends
a
peppery
quality
to
the
taste
there
is
a
sweetness
in
the
background
though
this
is
a
pretty
serious
beer
it
isnt
terribly
heavy
in
texture
o
this
definitely
lives
up
to
the
hype
i
am
not
disappointed
at
all
i
have
one
more
bottle
so
will
probably
refine
this
when
i
break
it
open
o
this
definitely
lives
up
to
the
hype
i
am
not
disappointed
at
all
glad
i
was
able
to
try
it
now
i
must
get
more
overall
dont
know
if
it
lives
up
to
the
godly
hypewhat
beer
can
but
make
no
mistake
this
is
a
balanced
delicious
beer
with
a
great
flavor
profile
that
didnt
disappoint
me
o
i
know
this
beer
has
a
huge
claim
to
fame
but
im
just
not
a
fan
i
have
had
this
many
times
in
the
past
year
in
a
bunch
of
different
vintages
and
i
remain
firm
on
my
ranking
i
just
dont
like
it
i
dont
understand
all
the
hype
i
can
only
trust
my
tastebuds
what
i
will
say
is
that
i
like
this
beer
much
better
when
it
is
fresh
this
particular
bottle
has
10
years
on
it
overall
this
beer
is
better
than
average
and
has
a
lot
of
flavor
that
will
get
better
with
age
o
they
dont
call
this
the
worlds
best
beer
for
nothing
with
out
a
doubt
the
most
remarkable
quad
to
ever
hit
my
palate
sensational
ive
had
a
few
bottles
of
this
over
the
last
few
years
and
am
always
amazed
at
this
beer
i
at
first
wanted
it
to
be
awful
so
i
didnt
have
to
keep
driving
over
and
getting
some
but
unfortunately
i
was
wrong
the
hype
is
true
pours
a
nice
dark
carameltoffee
color
bit
khaki
head
that
slowly
falls
and
leaves
plenty
of
lacing
behind
the
smell
is
a
nice
blend
of
caramel
vanilla
figs
raisins
malt
molasses
and
dried
black
cherries
the
taste
is
just
as
complex
and
leaves
nothing
to
be
desired
a
nice
sweetness
in
the
finish
and
it
leaves
you
wanting
craving
more
world
class
beer
the
best
trappist
beer
ive
ever
had
but
not
the
best
beer
ive
ever
had

at

had

was

the

o
this
is
a

would
i
call
it
the
best
beer
in

no
bit
it
is
certainly
damn
good
particuarly
for
its
style
it
is
a
tad
on
the
sweet
and
sugary
side
i
would
say
but
very
nice
balance
and
flavor
along
with
the
amazing

put
this

the

great

feel
with
the

a
truly
amazing

best
trappist
best
belgian
incredible
drink
o
entirely
worth
it
a
great
beer
that
is
unique
and
awesome
and
i
crave
more
guess
ill
have
to
make
another
trip
to
belgium
hard
to
deny
that
its
one
of
the
best
beers
ive
ever
had
it
really
feels
like
liquid
bread
or
a
dessert
really
satisfying
but
i
could
only
have
one
every
once
in
a
while
but
if
i
could
i
would
definitely
have
it
a
few
times
a
year
absolutely
delicious
and
a
great
start
to
2013
overall
i
was
really
really
really
impressed
with
this
beer
after
hearing
for
years
that
a
rochefort
10
is
equally
on
par
with
this
if
not
better
i
have
to
say
that
i
do
not
agree
maybe
it
is
the
age
that
made
this
one
so
special
and
tasty
but
i
remember
being
really
unimpressed
with
the
rochefort
10
i
had
around
a
year
ago
this
reminds
me
agreat
deal
of
the
st
bernardus
60th
anniversary
beer
which
i
previously
thought
was
the
best
belgian
beer
i
have
ever
had
i
would
have
liked
to
sample
this
next
to
that
one
to
really
see
who
is
tops
and
i
will
revisit
a
rochefort
10
i
have
been
aging
as
well
in
a
year
to
see
if
my
memoryopinions
will
change
but
i
cannot
say
enough
about
this
beer
right
now
it
was
quite
special
indeed
o
the
best
quadstrong
dark
i
have
had
so
far
last
time
i
finished
the
bottle
with
some
dark
chocolate
cheesecake
not
a
good
match
this
seems
to
go
better
with
savory
foods
something
that
is
very
sweet
will
cancel
out
the
complexity
of
this
amazing
beer
in
summary
is
this
a
great
beer
yes
is
it
the
best
beer
in
the
world
for
me
probably
not
like
sex
everything
is
relative
and
everyone
is
entitled
to
their
opinion
ive
had
beers
that
i
enjoyed
better
but
i
just
slept
with
a
super
model
so
im
gonna
gloat
for
a
while
o
a
very
nice
quad
the
first
couple
of
sips
had
me
worried
that
it
was
going
to
be
average
but
it
really
improved
by
the
time
i
finished
it
i
think
it
will
benefit
from
some
aging
planning
on
spreading
the
other
5
bottles
over
the
course
of
a
few
years
an
obviously
fantastic
beer
like
frank
the
tank
in
old
school
said
once
it
hits
your
lips
its
so
good
one
of
the
smoothest
beers
ive
ever
tried
all
in
all
a
good
quad
if
i
didnt
know
it
was
the
best
beer
in
the
world
i
might
not
have
figured
it
out
by
whats
in
the
glass
it
is
very
good
caramel
but
iwe
enjoyed
everything
about
this
beer
and
the
others
mentioned
above
it
was
worth
the
drive
to
maryland
and
the
long

and

notes
sure
i
would
have
it
again
and
again
and
i
did
not
pay
tooo
much
for
this
bottle
but
there
is
some
undeniable
hype
riding
here
fruity
and
sweet
character
aside
this
is
on
a
similar
league
for
me
than
say
a
rochefort
10
which
is
readily
available
worth
the
try
and
wishing
i
could
ride
up
the
monastery
after
having
won
the
phone
lottery
to
pick
up
a
couple
of
legit
cases
but
that
is
another
story
best
by
date
of

o
i
must
profess
that
im
not
a
belgian
style
lover
im
not
sure
if
i
let
the
hype
get
to
me
or
i
feel
like
i
need
to
like
this
beer
because
it
was
expensive
but
i
really
enjoyed
this
if
i
was
able
to
have
access
to
this
regularly
it
would
be
a
staple
in
my
fridge
and
id
be
a
belgian
beer
fan
for
sure
worthy
of
the
acclaim
that
it
gets
i
wish
i
had
another
it
was
well
worth
the
money
whoever
says
that
this
u
s
import
version
is
inferior
to
its
predecessor
is
high
on
drugs
its
the
same
beer
for
better
or
worse
well
probably
worse
considering
the
price
o
easily
in
the
top
five
beers
i
have
ever
had
this
was
the
second
time
i
have
had
this
beer
and
it
was
just
as
good
as
the
first
i
think
i
might
like
the
8
more
but
not
by
much
fantastic
flavors
all
almagamated
nicely
if
you
are
in
to
craft
this
is
the
holy
grail
of
craft
consider
yourself
extremely
honored
and
privileged
if
you
get
the
opportunity
to
try
this
one
o
just
great
and
i
am
very
happy
i
was
able
to
get
a
bottle
i
cant
not
wait
to
try
this
again
easily
one
of
the
best
beer
i
have
had
and
very
easy
to
drink
i
almost
finished
the
bottle
before
the
review
and
that
rarely
happens
with
me
the
10
2
abv
really
sneak
up
on
you
having
had
an
indate
bottle
in
the
past
the
aged
one
was
just
as
good
but
probably
no
better
to
be
honest
slightly
more
earthy
if
that
makes
sense
to
anyone
d
this
is
an
incredibly
easytodrink
high
abv
beer
i
need
to
find
more
serving
type
bottle
purchased
a
bottle
in
belgium
and
brought
it
back
to
the
states
it
was
in
the
cellar
for
4
years
and
i
just
opened
it
the
other
day
what
a
treat
the
color
was
deep
and
beautiful
the
nose
was
an
absolute
delight
definitely
candy
and
caramel
notes
the
mouthfeel
was
perfect
in
terms
of
body
not
too
much
and
not
too
little
and
the
taste
well
amazing
looking
forward
to
going
back
to
buy
another
for
those
blessed
monks
cheers
even
though
this
is
a
difficult
beer
to
find
especially
now
i
have
come
to
find
over
the
years
that
this
has
been
one
of
the
best
beers
i
have
ever
had
as
far
as
quads
go
it
has
a
consistent
dark
malty
flavor
without
being
overbearing
it
does
have
a
very
slight
banana
ester
flavorjust
a
hint
so
may
not
be
as
noticeable
as
i
have
found
over
the
years
drinkingtryingcomparing
quite
a
few
beers
especially
in
the
quad
category
this
one
always
seems
to
be
consistently
terrific
but
now
is
extremely
difficult
to
find
is
it
better
than
younger
i
would
say
they
are
both
excellent
but
i
dont
see
the
hype
there
are
many
beers
more
attainable
that
i
enjoy
at
least
as
much
but
i
will
say
the
hype
and
story
makes
each
try
of
both
an
experience
o
screw
the
hype
i
love
this
beer
ive
had
it
along
with
most
of
the
other
belgian
quads
and
varying
ages
and
this
is
still
my
favorite
i
think
23yrs
really
is
perfect
for
the
beer
to
showcase
everything
overall
i
aged
this
one
just
over
3
years
and
celebrated
the
birth
of
my
daughter
with
this
beer
and
i
must
say
this
is
just
a
perfect
quad
overall
impression
i
was
somewhat
surprised
about
the
differences
between
the
batches
bottled
just
3
months
apart
but
even
moreso
by
the
subtlety
of
both
bottles
id
almost
go
so
far
as
to
call
them
tame
at
least
in
the
bold
world
of
quads
tasty
although
somewhat
underwhelming
perhaps
they
go
through
something
akin
to
the
awkward
stage
you
often
see
in
american
barleywines
ill
update
my
review
if
i
get
the
chance
to
try
fresher
or
older
samples
o
i
have
had
this
on
numerous
occasions
and
i
always
forget
to
review
it
this
bottle
really
surprised
me
compared
to
the
past
bottles
ive
had
incredibly
smooth
and
well
balanced
world
class
beer
very
impressive
o
very
drinkable
very
good
beer
the
best
trappist
beer
ive
had
yet
the
flavors
while
mellow
are
blended
perfectly
and
leave
a
pleasant
aftertaste
kudos
to
the
monks
on
a
superb
beer
o
there
is
a
reason
this
beer
is
constantly
battling
for
the
number
1
spot
o
is
this
one
of
those
cases
of
unrealistic
expectations
im
not
sure
the
excessive
carbonation
definitely
takes
this
bottle
down
a
notch
for
me
as
the
first
half
was
almost
impossible
to
taste
but
beyond
that
id
say
this
is
a
nice
but
not
amazing
beer
im
curious
to
see
if
its
substantially
different
on
tap
when
i
have
a
chance
to
visit
belgium
next
spring
chewy
but
nice
and
light
with
the
good
carbonation
little
bit
of
an
alcohol
burn
very
complex
delicious
beer
i
can
understand
the
hype
if
ill
be
at
the
belgium
coast
on
vacation
next
year
ill
again
buy
a
crate
but
for
me
this
beer
is
not
worth
any
effort
very
disappointing
and
absolutely
overrated
o
if
i
could
give
this
beer
a
6
out
of
5
i
would
it
just
doesnt
get
much
better
than
this
and
i
wish
it
was
easier
to
find
but
i
cant
complain
too
much
because
i
was
lucky
to
get
one
thanks
to
my
wife
just
amazing
overall
an
impressive
blend
of
flavors
and
subdued
notes
like
an
artists
palate
high
abv
makes
the
repeated
drinkability
low
beyond
savoring
a
few
in
celebration
awesome
overall
no
hype
here
overall
just
a
fantastic
quad
so
smooth
and
nice
subtle
flavours
yet
complex
o
an
amazing
beer
its
reputation
really
is
well
deserved
one
of
the
best
beers
ive
ever
tasted
i
checked
a
case
in
a
roller
bag
none
broke
the
monks
use
good
glass
overall
one
of
the
best
beers
in
the
world
not
over
rated
at
all
o
having
had
rochefort
10
and
st
b
in
the
last
week
in
preparation
to
try
the
westy
12
i
am
basing
a
lot
of
my
review
on
how
westy
12
compares
to
those
excellent
beers
in
all
honesty
i
think
westy
12
is
an
amazing
beer
for
me
there
is
quite
a
few
similarities
to
st
b
abt
12
i
think
the
westy
12
is
just
a
bit
better
overall
very
complex
aroma
and
taste
nice
carbonated
full
bodied
mouthfeel
is
this
the
best
beer
in
the
world
that
is
hard
to
say
as
one
of
the
best
beers
in
my
favorite
style
i
would
have
to
say
it
is
certainly
in
contention
overall
westvleteren
12
impressed
me
more
then
i
thought
there
were
so
many
different
flavors
going
on
that
it
blew
me
away
the
best
beer
in
the
world
maybe
maybe
not
but
it
is
a
good
beer
that
anybody
should
try
if
they
have
the
chance
unfortunately
this
beer
came
at
the
beginning
of
my
beer
drinking
career
and
im
convinced
has
forever
tainted
my
taste
by
setting
the
bar
so
damn
high
it
is
perfect
subtle
yet
bold
with
a
fruity
taste
that
is
neither
to
sweet
nor
to
tart
light
with
an
amberbrown
color
it
goes
down
smooth
and
has
a
taste
reminiscent
of
times
only
monks
could
capture
in
a
beverage
a
and
r
i
p
probably
the
only
bottle
i
will
only
drink
if
you
see
this
get
it
youll
want
to
error
on
the
side
of
warmer
rather
than
colder
the
beer
really
comes
alive
as
it
warms
this
beer
doesnt
need
anything
from
me
to
pump
it
up
so
all
i
can
say
is
try
it
if
youre
a
beer
geek
you
owe
it
to
yourself
i
actually
prefer
westy
8
but
this
is
near
the
top
of
the
list
mouthfeel
is
rich
and
luxurious
the
alcohol
is
not
a
negative
factor
this
is
an
outstanding
beer
0
severed
in
chimay
chalice
it
produces
about
2
fingers
width
of
white
fluffy
head
that
disappears
somewhat
quickly
the
color
is
a
outstanding
dark
chestrnut
brown
the
smell
is
very
faint
i
pick
up
the
belgium
yeast
a
boozy
smell
and
very
faint
caramel
sweetness
the
first
sip
is
amazing
where
i
was
let
down
by
the
smell
the
taste
blew
me
out
of
the
water
great
caramelmolasses
flavor
nice
dark
fruit
like
raisins
or
figs
and
that
great
belgium
yeast
flavor
the
mouthfeel
is
prefect
great
balance
between
the
carbonation
and
the
body
overall
this
was
one
of
my
favorite
beers
i
had
the
10
alc
was
extremely
well
hidden
in
the
taste
this
is
a
dangerous
beer
if
i
could
get
my
hands
on
it
more
often
i
would
drink
this
all
the
time
so
in
a
nutshell
a
awesome
brew
but
not
what
i
would
call
the
1
beer
in
the
world
o
great
quad
probably
the
best
i
have
had
in
the
style
glad
to
have
tried
it
but
it
does
not
live
up
to
the
hype
this
is
surely
not
the
best
beer
i
have
ever
tried
o
i
actually
wanted
to
not
like
this
beer
as
much
as
i
did
i
know
it
has
a
great
deal
of
hype
and
i
figured
since
i
invested
0
on
the
bottle
i
would
be
going
into
it
unbiased
it
blew
me
away
though
this
is
an
excellent
quadrupel
and
its
worthy
of
its
high
ranking
i
enjoyed
it
much
more
than
the
easier
to
find
examples
and
the
only
other
quad
that
i
have
had
that
surpassed
this
was
pannepot
grand
reserva
i
was
a
bit
disapointed
by
the
lack
of
roundness
of
it
maybe
because
of
the
age
for
other
beers
it
did
not
happen
so
often
as
close
to
perfection
regarding
quads
as
far
as
ive
had
i
suggest
eating
beforehand
or
pairing
with
something
after
you
get
a
taste
for
it
because
this
leaves
the
head
feeling
good
afterwards
if
you
arent
prepared
d
its
a
shame
that
this
is
sort
of
hard
to
get
its
very
enjoyable
and
one
i
wouldnt
mind
pulling
out
from
time
to
time
by
all
means
if
you
can
grab
some
definitely
do
so
thanks
to
urbancaver
for
this
one
best
birthday
present
ever
o
a
beautiful
taste
experience
and
i
believe
that
it
lives
up
to
the
hype
o
ive
learned
that
im
just
not
a
fan
of
many
quad
styles
this
was
a
fine
beer
but
cant
say
it
was
mind
blowing
pours
a
burgundy
color
with
a
thin
layer
of
head
that
doesnt
dissolve
quickly
smells
a
decent
amount
of
cherries
and
of
some
booziness
the
first
taste
warms
up
the
mouth
as
the
heat
recedes
the
flavors
present
themselves
cherries
currants
and
slight
oakiness
a
complex
beer
but
simple
in
its
enjoyment
glad
i
took
this
journey
pretentiousness
aside
the
westy
was
well
worth
it
great
beer
drinkability
is
pretty
good
ive
had
this
a
few
times
but
this
is
the
first
full
bottle
ive
savored
on
my
own
obviously
its
hard
to
get
a
hold
of
so
that
hurts
it
but
overall
its
a
great
beer
a
top
candidate
for
a
desert
island
beer
oa
very
enjoyable
quad
and
could
honestly
drink
alot
of
if
we
saw
regularly
on
our
shelves
top
stuff
thanks
mate
all
of
that
said
it
is
not
such
a
spectacular
beer
that
i
would
probably
not
go
the
great
lengths
it
generally
takes
to
acquire
this
beer
outstanding
overall
definitely
a
fantastic
wellbalanced
quad
is
it
the
best
beer
or
even
belgian
quad
ive
ever
had
unfortunately
not
id
really
like
to
get
another
bottle
of
this
and
let
it
age
for
a
couple
of
years
to
see
how
it
improves
this
many
people
cant
be
wrong
cheers
is
this
beer
overrated
i
would
say
yes
it
is
still
excellent
however
for
something
represented
as
being
all
things
to
all
people
it
holds
up
well
cant
wait
to
try
the
ba
version
gonna
be
hard
to
top
this
one
poured
a
golden
brown
medium
head
minimal
lacing
and
a
terrific
aroma
of
candied
sugars
figs
and
raisins
excellent
body
with
medium
sweetness
hints
of
vanilla
dark
fruits
and
some
caramel
excellent
carbonation
and
a
solid
finish
i
think
what
sets
this
one
apart
form
others
it
the
incredible
balance
between
the
carbonation
flavors
and
alcohol
hard
to
live
up
to
the
hype
of
being
the
highest
ranked
beer
in
the
world
but
definitely
something
everyone
must
try
if
you
have
the
chance
it
is
worth
it
great
beer
for
my
40th
o
overall
a
great
beer
a
phenomenal
beer
but
not
the
perfect
beer
if
the
mouth
was
matched
perfectly
to
the
nose
this
may
have
been
my
first
perfect
5
but
alas
it
was
not
to
be
a
delicious
and
complex
trappist
ale
it
is
truly
excellent
though
im
not
sure
i
buy
into
the
myth
that
it
is
the
best
of
the
trappists
o
hey
its
westy
i
completely
love
what
it
is
but
i
think
i
would
rather
have
roc
10
o
worth
tracking
down
and
an
excellent
beer
but
naturally
it
cant
live
up
to
the
overwhelming
hype
attributed
to
it
o
incredibly
tasty
brew
more
complexity
then
my
palate
can
even
fathom
taste
is
out
of
this
world
lived
up
to
the
hype
for
me
always
on
the
prowl
for
more
pours
a
beautiful
dark
brown
it
smells
of
sweet
fruit
rum
sugar
and
malts
the
taste
is
very
sweet
and
complex
with
a
good
deal
of
alcohol
there
is
a
nice
warming
mouthfeel
from
the
alcohol
and
medium
carbonation
i
preferred
westvleteren
8
but
this
was
still
amazing
i
think
perhaps
this
one
would
have
benefited
from
a
bit
more
aging
thanks
to
wyatt
for
this
gem
poured
from
a
12
oz
glass
into
a
tulip
glass
pours
a
brownlish
murky
red
color
with
a
thin
head
that
leaves
qucikly
the
smell
is
of
yeasty
fresh
bread
and
a
slight
booziness
too
the
taste
is
bitter
on
the
front
end
but
that
leaves
quick
and
your
mouth
is
filled
with
a
fruity
sweetness
that
coats
your
whole
mouth
the
sweetness
stays
but
you
still
get
that
bitterness
it
is
well
balanced
and
not
boozy
at
all
like
the
smell
leads
i
can
see
why
this
one
is
rated
so
high
while
i
do
agree
with
it
having
a
high
rating
i
have
to
admit
id
take
a
russian
imp
stout
over
this
any
day
still
a
great
beer
and
im
glad
i
got
to
try
it
thanks
wyatt
o
amazingly
balanced
and
complex
far
too
smooth
for
how
much
alcohol
is
in
there
without
a
doubt
a
fantastic
beer
that
just
about
lives
up
to
its
hype
st
bernardus
is
also
a
great
beer
but
really
i
do
believe
westvleteren
is
in
another
class
a
really
nice
beer
inline
with
or
slightly
better
than
rochefort
or
st
bernadus
the
monks
do
it
right
o
overall
i
would
say
this
may
have
been
one
of
the
best
beers
i
have
ever
tasted
i
wish
i
could
have
had
a
full
bottle
of
it
but
from
what
i
had
it
was
outstanding
i
feel
as
though
there
is
much
more
to
experience
from
this
beer
because
it
is
just
so
complex
if
i
ever
get
the
opportunity
i
will
definitely
try
this
again
and
hopefully
unlock
more
of
the
complex
secrets
this
beer
offers
overall
best
beer
in
the
world
damn
good
chance
of
it
this
beer
was
well
worth
the
wait
and
easily
one
of
the
best
beers
ive
ever
had
definitely
top
2
or
3
i
dont
know
when
i
will
get
the
chance
to
have
this
one
again
but
i
certainly
hope
its
soon
a
nice
balanced
tasting
quad
with
flavors
of
dark
fruits
spice
with
dessert
and
candy
qualities
the
nose
was
a
bit
strong
on
the
alcohol
but
for
this
alcohol
by
volume
i
feel
that
is
forgivable
ive
never
been
overly
impressed
with
this
one
like
everyone
else
is
but
it
certainly
is
a
great
beer
i
believe
the
scores
more
have
to
do
with
the
elusive
character
the
beer
maintains
due
to
its
limited
availability
and
the
monks
choice
to
not
commercialize
their
beer
overall
this
is
a
fantastic
brew
although
overrated
it
is
on
the
same
level
as
st
bernardus
and
rochefort
and
i
would
actually
prefer
st
bernardus
this
put
every
trappist
that
is
available
in
the
states
to
shame
i
did
a
side
by
side
comparison
when
i
got
home
and
the
old
favorites
paled
up
against
the
westy
overall
this
is
an
amazing
beer
ive
yet
to
have
it
fresh
but
i
cant
imagine
it
tasting
any
better
than
this
bottle
does
right
now
this
is
a
beer
i
will
always
be
seeking
out
dark
copper
brown
colour
with
a
nice
white
head
sweet
malts
brown
sugar
light
wine
and
raisins
rich
malt
taste
light
bitterness
definite
suggestions
of
sugar
raisins
and
a
very
light
spice
profile
light
alcohol
burn
rich
but
not
heavy
and
a
light
but
effervescent
body
up
there
with
rochefort
10
but
a
bit
rarer
and
a
bit
more
expensive
an
ideal
quad
but
not
one
id
buy
often
if
only
because
of
the
price
did
it
live
up
to
the
hype
honestly
my
favorite
quad
is
still
rochefort
10
im
actually
relieved
because
this
beer
certainly
isnt
an
easy
one
to
get
im
happy
that
i
had
the
opportunity
to
try
it
and
i
recommend
that
if
you
can
try
it
keep
an
open
mind
maybe
it
will
be
the
best
thing
you
ever
had
but
i
really
feel
a
lot
of
the
strong
ratings
come
from
the
rarityhype
around
this
gem
still
an
amazing
beer
no
doubt
about
that
and
it
is
world
class
just
not
my
personal
favorite
quad
i
am
fortunate
enough
to
be
studying
in
london
this
fall
and
was
even
more
fortunate
that
my
dad
wanted
to
visit
and
see
belgium
and
him
and
his
friend
were
willing
to
drive
to
the
middle
of
nowhere
to
try
a
beer
they
had
never
heard
about
as
i
walked
into
in
dre
verde
my
whole
body
was
shaking
with
anticipation
and
i
must
say
the
12
didnt
let
down
it
was
poured
into
the
westvleteren
glass
and
it
looked
so
elegant
it
had
a
perfect
one
and
half
inch
head
right
up
to
the
lip
and
from
the
first
sip
i
could
tell
what
an
amazing
beer
it
was
just
like
the
other
westys
it
has
a
full
and
i
mean
full
body
and
right
away
you
can
taste
4
or
5
different
flavors
coming
through
what
most
impressed
me
was
the
smoothness
from
start
to
finish
it
was
incredibly
consistent
after
all
of
my
hyping
my
father
and
friend
were
also
very
impressed
and
could
see
why
we
made
the
trip
cant
wait
to
try
another
bottle
of
this
when
i
get
home
d
no
doubt
a
world
class
beer
very
complex
and
hides
the
alcohol
well
very
excited
to
have
another
two
to
age
a
few
years
330ml
bottle
twice
this
is
the
mecca
of
all
beers
every
beer
lovers
journey
must
include
this
bad
boy
lucky
to
have
traded
twice
for
one
pours
a
super
syrupy
brown
with
nearly
zero
head
on
a
careful
pour
smells
very
bready
along
with
nuts
and
dark
fruit
the
taste
is
delicate
brown
sugar
malt
with
several
layers
of
sweetness
i
pickup
lots
of
belgian
dark
sugar
and
it
reminds
me
a
bit
of
a
well
aged
barleywine
but
not
as
thick
or
heavy
the
mouthfeel
is
slick
and
a
tad
syrupy
with
a
nice
medium
carbonation
mild
alchohol
finish
on
it
but
i
loved
it
overall
such
a
fantastic
fantastic
beer
and
well
worth
the
wait
i
enforced
upon
myself
and
it
lives
up
to
the
hype
its
unbelievable
to
me
that
there
are
belgians
out
there
that
have
the
opportunity
to
drink
this
beer
on
a
semiregular
basis
i
will
seek
this
beer
out
again
sometime
and
encourage
all
beer
lovers
to
try
it
at
some
point
in
their
lives
o
4
5
overall
yes
i
agree
this
beer
is
living
up
to
the
hype
for
me
i
really
enjoy
this
beer
and
i
want
to
get
my
hands
on
more
seek
it
out
and
enjoy
it
every
beer
geek
needs
to
try
this
once
in
thier
life
willing
to
visit
the
brewery
for
a
beer
that
is
without
a
doubt
world
class
beer
the
10
2
only
become
evident
as
the
mouth
dries
so
well
is
the
body
and
mouthfeel
a
truely
great
beer
certainly
now
in
my
top
10
only
the
appearance
letting
it
down
d
for
a
quad
drinkability
is
very
high
edit
reading
back
over
the
reviews
i
believe
this
beer
has
been
subject
to
the
tried
and
true
overhype
phenomenon
someone
says
its
the
shit
and
people
taste
it
even
if
it
isnt
there
covet
this
beer
but
dont
assume
its
the
be
all
and
end
all
o
hands
down
the
best
quad
and
the
best
beer
ive
ever
had
to
date
o
excellent
beer
very
complex
very
drinkable
and
well
put
together
we
wont
talk
hype
but
this
cant
be
worth
whatever
price
my
friend
paid
to
get
it
back
here
id
love
to
have
this
one
again
side
by
side
with
the
st
bernardus
abt
12
mouthfeel
mouthfeel
is
just
under
medium
with
high
very
fine
carbonation
pillowy
mouthfeel
this
beer
was
certainly
good
as
i
had
expected
but
i
wasnt
awed
by
it
a
little
sweeter
than
i
was
expecting
which
retracted
for
me
the
setting
probably
had
a
lot
to
do
with
how
much
i
love
this
beer
i
drank
it
from
the
bottle
on
a
square
in
bruge
during
my
honeymoon
it
was
not
the
ideal
way
to
drink
it
but
it
was
amazing
none
the
less
luckily
i
have
one
more
in
my
cellar
i
just
need
a
reason
to
drink
it
note
this
tasting
was
done
sidebyside
with
rochefort
10
and
i
found
this
beer
just
ever
so
slightly
more
impressive
on
the
aroma
and
mouthfeel
otherwise
they
were
very
close
a
murky
brown
with
a
nice
creamy
head
to
it
higher
carb
that
i
anticipated
smell
is
of
dates
fig
grapeskin
and
caramalized
brown
sugar
taste
is
all
the
same
very
strong
on
the
dark
fruit
flavors
i
was
impressed
by
how
strong
the
date
and
fig
come
out
in
this
very
good
quad
nice
balanced
flavors
good
mouthfeel
but
a
touch
high
on
the
carbonation
this
was
an
09
vintage
o
no
doubt
one
of
the
best
beers
ive
ever
had
i
just
cant
put
the
glass
down
so
drinkable
so
delicious
basically
perfect
a
pure
joy
to
drink
theres
a
reason
this
beer
is
considered
by
many
to
be
the
1
beer
in
the
world
i
was
worried
it
wouldnt
live
up
to
all
the
hype
but
it
absolutely
did
and
everyone
else
tasting
it
felt
the
same
way
o
i
simply
cannot
recommend
this
beer
highly
enough
an
excellent
example
of
belgian
monastic
brewing
at
its
finest
o
seek
out
if
you
like
belgians
although
st
bernardus
12
and
rochefort
10
are
more
than
adequate
substitutes
if
not
available
to
you
o
one
of
the
best
quads
i
have
ever
had
i
can
definitely
see
why
its
ranked
1
cant
wait
to
try
this
on
tap
some
day
this
beer
was
a
pleasure
to
drink
and
felt
great
as
it
went
down
very
high
drinkability
this
was
an
outstanding
beer
that
i
am
happy
to
have
tried
as
its
not
readily
available
in
the
us
and
i
was
lucky
enough
to
try
some
brought
back
straight
from
belgium
it
went
down
so
smooth
and
easy
hid
the
abv
with
perfection
so
it
wasnt
even
a
factor
and
this
beer
was
just
impressive
in
every
facet
of
this
drinking
experience
this
beer
lived
up
to
the
hype
and
is
a
very
high
recommendation
hard
to
beat
i
have
had
a
couple
of
12s
since
that
day
both
had
been
aged
for
a
couple
of
years
great
but
not
the
same
perhaps
the
travel
and
heat
altered
it
fresh
is
what
i
will
always
remember
the
monks
advocate
drinking
it
fresh
and
from
my
experience
i
have
to
agree
amazing
quad
ordered
this
one
online
vastly
overpriced
but
i
had
to
try
it
quads
arent
my
personal
favorite
style
but
for
a
quad
this
is
definitely
the
best
in
my
opinion
very
flavorful
with
a
nice
level
of
sweetness
and
an
interesting
level
of
hops
alcohol
felt
well
masked
it
poured
a
dark
brown
with
perfect
head
left
on
top
wish
this
was
more
readily
available
but
if
i
get
the
chance
i
will
definitely
purchase
again
lives
up
to
the
hype
it
is
the
king
of
beer
he
has
a
great
background
pity
that
it
can
not
simply
buy
overall
man
i
wish
this
wasnt
so
hot
it
feels
like
a
typical
hot
young
wine
that
needs
to
age
maybe
that
will
make
it
better
would
love
to
age
this
and
try
it
again
some
day
in
the
future
o
it
lived
up
to
its
name
glad
to
try
this
before
hitting
up
belgium
in
a
few
weeks
i
will
be
sure
to
take
notes
of
all
the
other
great
beers
i
am
trying
out
there
o
wasnt
sure
what
id
think
after
reading
so
much
about
it
but
this
definitely
lives
up
to
its
reputation
imo
the
overall
balance
is
unreal
and
it
was
a
complete
pleasure
to
drink
in
almost
every
way
it
is
going
to
be
a
total
challenge
to
save
my
2nd
bottle
this
perhaps
was
the
beer
i
have
been
most
excited
for
from
day
one
on
ba
i
never
really
hunted
it
i
knew
it
would
always
be
there
leave
it
to
alewatcher
to
make
it
happen
for
me
when
i
wasnt
even
trying
this
ended
up
being
one
of
my
favorite
beers
of
what
is
probably
my
favorite
style
ill
have
to
get
more
than
one
bottle
of
this
soon
overall
terrific
its
a
shame
this
is
so
hard
for
people
to
try
its
also
a
factor
to
bear
in
mind
when
trying
to
objectively
review
this
beer
overall
just
an
amazing
beer
everything
blends
together
perfectly
kind
of
reminds
me
of
a
super
smooth
barleywine
i
definitely
want
to
have
more
in
the
future
overall
i
have
had
about
15
bottles
from
this
case
over
the
past
5
years
i
tried
to
space
them
out
while
givingsharing
the
others
i
hope
this
has
diminished
the
hyperarity
factor
so
that
i
am
not
too
swayed
by
those
factors
so
even
at
5
years
this
is
a
wonderful
tasty
beer
i
may
have
liked
it
better
at
3
years
or
even
fresh
but
it
has
held
up
well
for
those
who
like
rochefort
10
or
any
other
quads
this
is
a
beer
that
you
must
try
it
may
not
live
up
to
the
hype
for
some
but
its
worth
the
try
even
my
cat
loved
the
drop
i
put
on
the
table
for
her
i
guess
its
nearly
impossible
to
do
but
i
wish
a
usa
company
could
replicate
this
beer
finally
got
to
try
one
of
these
top
rated
beers
and
it
doesnt
disappoint
the
velvety
smooth
mouthfeel
is
probably
the
highlight
but
the
taste
is
very
balanced
and
complex
very
complex
many
aromas
many
dimensions
must
be
examined
more
times
o
excellent
quad
alcohol
is
invisible
unlike
the
rochefort
10
and
st
bernadus
abt
but
thats
just
me
today
13092011
i
tasted
a
westy
12
once
more
at
the
vrede
next
to
the
monastery
sintsixtus
what
a
great
beer
we
discovered
my
buddy
ed
and
i
that
when
this
beer
is
served
not
to
cold
but
say
around
1718
degrees
celcius
it
is
absolutely
world
class
nothing
comes
close
you
can
drink
this
beer
anytime
of
the
day
and
take
any
kind
of
meal
with
it
it
will
hold
or
maybe
thats
just
my
perception
o
absolutely
lived
up
the
they
hype
for
me
belgian
ales
are
typically
not
one
of
my
preferred
styles
and
this
is
the
first
one
i
have
had
that
i
would
drink
every
day
if
it
was
available
truly
remarkable
words
cannot
describe
rich
complex
and
delicious
the
epitome
of
ultimate
beerdom
cherry
yeast
bread
full
bodied
beautiful
color
and
packs
quite
a
punch
sampled
at
the
trappist
tasting
the
moan
and
dove
amherst
ma
at
that
point
i
was
quite
libashed
so
apologies
for
a
less
specific
review
try
it
if
you
can
this
beer
is
a
bit
underwhelming
and
maybe
it
was
the
age
but
i
found
that
ive
liked
st
bernardus
12
and
a
couple
other
quads
ive
had
in
the
past
better
o
this
is
fantastic
lives
up
to
the
hype
it
was
like
a
fantastic
dessert
or
a
flavorful
steak
that
melts
in
your
mouth
jd
leaps
and
bounds
better
than
the
first
westy
12
i
had
that
was
full
of
sediment
and
aged
on
its
side
o
so
delicious
and
drinkable
could
easily
drink
this
every
night
for
the
rest
of
my
life
definitely
the
best
quad
that
has
crossed
my
taste
buds
simply
incredible
wish
this
glass
would
last
forever
d
appearance
wise
not
amazing
flavouraromas
are
subdued
i
guess
with
age
mouthfeel
retains
a
lovely
creaminess
and
full
mouthfeel
overall
not
a
beer
i
would
say
has
enhanced
with
age
certainly
no
developing
complexties
eventhough
not
drinking
this
beer
before
i
cant
help
but
feel
its
lost
some
former
glory
would
love
to
try
fresh
pours
a
hazy
brownish
copper
with
a
tan
head
the
nose
is
slightly
caramel
and
bready
with
dark
fruits
and
plum
the
taste
is
big
bready
yeasty
plum
with
a
touch
of
banana
and
other
dark
fruits
and
slightly
caramel
malts
very
smooth
flavor
with
a
very
subtle
complexity
blink
and
you
miss
it
good
carbonation
good
body
overall
this
is
a
very
good
beer
but
it
did
not
top
the
25
year
old
extra
8
maybe
worth
trying
once
then
grab
a
rochefort
10
given
the
relative
difference
in
ease
of
acquisition
overall
this
beer
is
phenomenal
and
worth
of
its
reputation
i
love
quads
have
tried
a
number
of
them
and
this
one
is
the
undisputed
king
i
cant
wait
to
have
occasion
to
drink
my
last
2
o
i
was
a
bit
skeptical
going
in
as
this
is
quite
the
highly
hyped
idolized
beer
however
the
beer
speaks
for
itself
and
completely
crushes
any
of
the
perceived
hype
surrounding
delicious
and
thats
all
o
incredible
i
dont
know
how
much
of
that
is
the
rare
talking
but
at
the
first
sip
i
was
blown
away
huge
and
bold
but
still
tame
and
so
well
balanced
this
is
an
amazing
beer
the
fact
that
it
is
so
hard
to
get
and
the
recipe
hasnt
changed
for
thousands
of
years
makes
drinking
it
a
great
experience
i
think
the
8
was
better
but
this
one
was
really
good
as
well
rich
raisiney
well
masked
alcohol
thick
complex
like
a
big
meaty
red
wine
this
is
one
of
the
finest
quads
i
have
had
but
i
cant
say
it
lives
up
to
the
hype
i
would
rank
this
right
along
side
the
rochefort
10
yet
the
unobtainability
and
buyers
remorse
creates
a
mythical
presence
in
this
beer
that
causes
to
be
catapulted
to
the
top
of
any
beer
list
this
is
a
fine
beer
that
should
certainly
be
seeked
out
but
is
it
definitively
the
best
beer
in
the
world
probably
not
o
very
good
o
this
is
still
one
of
my
favorite
beers
of
all
time
from
the
dark
complex
flavors
to
the
soft
velvety
feel
you
would
be
hard
pressed
to
find
a
better
quad
i
cant
wait
for
my
next
encounter
with
this
amazing
beer
o
what
can
i
say
that
hasnt
been
said
already
this
is
quite
simply
the
best
tasting
beer
ive
ever
had
considering
the
relative
difficulty
in
obtaining
it
im
not
sure
how
many
times
in
my
life
i
will
get
to
taste
this
beer
again
but
im
very
glad
i
had
to
opportunity
to
do
so
if
you
have
the
chance
make
every
effort
to
experience
this
masterpiece
when
i
got
this
beer
i
was
in
the
company
of
some
flemish
friends
i
took
no
time
to
critique
it
i
didnt
figure
out
what
kind
of
farts
it
produces
or
count
each
tiny
bubble
of
the
head
nope
i
just
drank
it
in
good
company
it
is
thick
sweet
complex
and
delicious
now
is
it
my
favorite
beer
of
all
time
close
top
3
for
sure
just
a
total
experience
the
aroma
hints
of
grapes
and
some
dark
fruits
as
well
the
flavor
is
grapes
and
dark
fruits
mixed
with
wonderful
belgian
yeast
characteristics
and
no
hotness
whatsoever
this
is
delicious
well
balanced
and
very
smooth
the
mouthfeel
is
amazingly
soft
and
effervescent
like
real
champagne
gotta
put
the
8
a
hair
above
this
brew
but
damn
is
it
close
i
think
it
comes
down
to
personal
preference
i
prefer
dubbels
to
quads
or
tripels
id
make
a
lousy
figure
skater
as
a
general
rule
however
i
do
enjoy
a
fine
quadrupel
and
this
is
most
certainly
among
the
top
of
its
class
overall
truly
an
excellent
beer
given
the
availability
and
price
disparities
i
would
go
for
the
rochefort
10
but
this
is
just
wonderful
glad
i
got
to
try
it
and
unless
i
want
to
think
that
its
all
downhill
from
here
i
have
to
believe
that
until
the
end
of
my
beerdrinking
days
this
seemed
to
have
some
oxidation
going
on
but
it
was
spectacular
nonetheless
medium
bodied
with
good
carbonation
i
may
need
to
seek
out
more
bottles
for
a
follow
up
try
soon
utterly
complex
and
unique
who
wouldnt
want
to
drink
it
frankly
both
the
missus
and
i
were
expecting
this
one
to
disappoint
a
bit
given
its
chargin
hype
train
and
the
fact
that
a
belgian
quadrupel
is
not
really
a
goto
style
for
me
this
one
however
has
won
us
over
completely
with
its
subtle
complexity
there
are
other
beers
that
have
blown
my
mind
more
personally
but
i
cant
think
of
any
that
have
matched
this
one
in
its
refinement
subtle
but
superassertive
certainly
nobodys
session
beer
but
one
that
i
would
love
to
have
on
any
occasion
reviewed
from
notes
i
had
this
amazing
brew
on
a
trip
to
europe
that
was
as
equally
amazing
sampled
at
in
de
vrede
in
the
shadow
of
the
abbey
of
saint
sixtus
it
really
doesnt
get
any
better
than
that
this
nectar
of
the
gods
pours
a
lovely
dark
brown
color
aroma
is
of
fruit
plumbs
and
sugar
canes
as
soon
as
you
take
a
sip
you
realize
that
this
beer
lives
up
to
the
hype
does
it
get
any
better
than
this
no
this
beer
coats
the
tongue
in
sweet
fruit
flavors
and
the
alcohol
is
so
well
hidden
that
you
are
not
aware
of
the
effects
that
is
until
you
walk
down
the
path
at
westvleteren
to
the
shrine
and
realize
that
you
are
extremely
drunk
this
is
ok
you
remind
yourself
as
you
are
in
europe
at
the
mecca
for
all
beer
drinkers
if
you
ever
have
the
chance
to
visit
please
do
you
will
not
be
disappointed
we
purchased
some
at
de
bier
temple
in
brussels
the
lady
there
has
plenty
to
go
around
so
if
you
miss
the
beer
line
or
all
orders
are
full
fear
not
she
has
you
covered
do
yourself
a
favor
and
grab
a
westy
it
is
what
the
gods
drink
cheers
o
lives
up
to
its
promise
super
hard
to
get
lucked
out
with
several
bottles
from
the
recent
release
in
vancouver
bc
the
head
was
just
right
smell
and
taste
are
really
great
its
a
beer
to
drink
while
you
are
in
the
company
of
good
friends
or
family
cant
wait
to
have
one
with
my
father
owow
this
is
amazing
note
ebay
prices
are
far
too
much
for
a
bottle
please
dont
buy
these
bottles
from
that
site
the
practice
is
against
the
wishes
of
the
monks
and
in
an
unbelievable
inflation
of
the
prices
for
each
bottle
if
you
really
need
a
small
number
of
bottles
please
post
to
the
belgium
forum
and
im
almost
certain
that
you
will
be
taken
care
of
o
extremely
complex
and
impressive
quad
i
was
absolutely
impressed
at
how
well
the
alcohol
is
masked
sure
you
can
tell
its
there
but
at
10
2
youd
think
it
would
be
more
noticeable
definitely
worth
the
hype
i
brought
a
bottle
home
with
me
to
cellar
current
plan
is
break
it
out
for
a
special
occasion
in
a
year
or
so
overall
there
is
just
something
amazingly
drinkable
and
smooth
about
this
big
flavorful
beer
almost
silky
on
the
palate
rounded
flavors
im
impressed
pours
cloudy
amber
with
a
tad
bit
of
reddish
pink
hue
minimal
but
creamy
head
around
the
edge
of
the
glass
the
nose
is
pounding
with
grapehoneywood
on
the
tongue
it
is
sweet
quite
sweet
grapes
or
raisins
then
the
alcohol
bites
you
in
the
rear
but
subtly
mouthfeel
is
excellent
goes
well
with
the
fruity
explosion
overall
the
westy
definitely
lives
up
to
the
hype
and
i
was
very
excited
to
drink
it
overall
super
smooth
and
easy
to
drink
i
concur
on
the
hype
to
this
super
smooth
and
savory
o
this
beer
is
incredible
believe
the
hype
anyway
on
to
the
review
as
you
can
see
from
the
video
this
beer
was
properly
poured
into
a
signature
westvleteren
goblet
dark
caramelized
brown
in
color
hazy
moderately
carbonated
with
a
beautifully
crafted
light
tan
head
that
settled
right
around
the
trappist
logo
of
the
glass
retained
throughout
the
session
and
exhibited
some
fine
lacing
robust
aroma
dark
fruits
dark
sugars
extremely
full
of
flavor
smooth
candi
sugars
toffee
dark
cherries
raisins
alcohol
is
noticeable
but
not
at
all
detrimental
earthy
organic
chewy
complex
medium
mouthfeel
but
full
of
flavor
slightly
bitter
aftertaste
and
very
drinkable
hard
to
tell
if
this
is
the
best
beer
that
i
have
ever
had
but
i
will
always
remember
the
day
in
nice
france
when
i
first
tried
this
beer
this
beer
wins
for
my
favorite
beer
moment
despite
its
religious
inspiration
this
really
is
a
beer
that
strikes
at
your
intellect
and
curiosity
more
than
the
heart
for
me
this
is
what
makes
it
so
inspiring
im
still
very
much
just
beginning
to
understanding
westy
12
but
i
can
recognise
its
genius
which
would
have
totally
missed
me
had
i
drunk
it
as
a
beer
rookie
many
years
ago
and
this
is
what
makes
me
think
that
people
here
award
it
top
marks
based
on
reputation
alone
either
that
or
bas
really
have
some
of
the
most
sophisticated
and
perceptive
palates
youll
find
anywhere
big
thanks
to
jason
for
sharing
this
rare
gem
with
me
at
the
bottle
share
pours
a
murky
brown
color
with
a
small
tan
head
that
sticks
around
for
a
little
scent
is
delicious
candied
dark
fruits
and
brown
sugar
taste
is
initially
sweet
caramel
followed
by
figs
and
prunes
lots
of
dark
fruits
with
hints
of
green
apple
molasses
and
brown
sugar
there
is
also
some
alcohol
taste
to
it
but
not
overwhelming
at
all
the
complexity
of
this
beer
is
ridiculous
mouthfeel
is
extremely
dry
and
fullbodied
wellbalanced
drinkability
is
very
high
for
the
abv
overall
this
beer
is
outstanding
and
im
glad
i
got
the
opportunity
to
try
it
however
the
beer
does
not
blow
rochefort
10
outta
the
water
so
im
not
sure
if
its
worth
all
the
trouble
getting
one
overall
very
nice
beer
would
gladly
drink
it
again
and
was
thrilled
i
finally
got
to
try
it
but
im
not
understanding
the
holy
grail
status
o
if
this
were
local
and
reasonably
priced
i
could
easily
drink
this
on
a
regular
basis
definitely
lived
up
to
the
hype
and
i
will
seek
this
out
again
o
ive
had
westy
12
a
couple
times
now
once
was
pretty
good
but
this
batch
seems
to
be
a
step
up
from
the
last
time
i
had
it
definitely
one
of
the
best
beers
ive
ever
had
and
one
of
my
favorite
styles
as
well
if
you
get
a
chance
to
try
this
beer
youll
never
forget
it
its
a
masterpiece
that
gets
better
w
every
sip
cheers
advocates
i
think
the
age
of
this
bottle
is
certainly
bringing
it
down
a
bit
i
have
several
newer
versions
and
will
update
this
review
to
reflect
the
best
buy
date
mo
very
good
carbonation
and
presentation
even
after
aged
for
a
year
very
good
balance
with
strong
alcohol
aroma
but
not
overpowering
the
flavor
or
the
texture
this
beer
is
balanced
on
a
knifes
edge
presenting
weight
and
superior
drinkability
m
medium
feel
with
lots
of
carbonation
smooth
and
nice
overall
this
beer
pours
a
nice
brown
color
wh
a
small
off
white
head
that
recedes
quickly
the
smell
is
sweet
slightly
spicey
and
reminds
me
of
concord
grapes
the
taste
follows
suit
with
a
very
mild
yeasty
spiciness
with
amazing
layers
of
fruit
flavors
coming
through
and
a
nice
sweet
finish
but
not
too
sweet
the
mouthfeel
is
full
and
medium
carbed
overall
this
beer
more
than
lived
up
to
the
hype
would
definitely
trade
for
this
beer
again
overall
wonder
full
im
glad
i
tried
it
but
i
prefer
some
others
particularly
given
the
cost
and
difficulty
getting
this
perhaps
some
fresh
from
the
brewer
would
be
ideal
t
lots
of
raisin
and
brown
sugar
flavor
upfront
along
with
some
brandy
hints
of
plum
and
raisin
on
the
finish
along
with
a
nice
warmness
on
the
way
down
some
spiciness
and
a
bit
of
white
pepper
to
be
found
in
this
as
well
well
worth
its
reputation
i
dont
know
if
its
my
favorite
beer
ever
still
a
sucker
for
abyss
but
this
is
a
stellar
beer
overall
a
very
nice
beer
maybe
it
was
all
the
hype
but
i
can
definitely
see
how
this
is
voted
the
best
beer
in
the
world
the
complexity
was
remarkable
quadrupels
are
not
my
favorite
style
but
i
thoroughly
enjoyed
westvleteren
12
if
it
wasnt
so
expensive
and
so
damn
hard
to
get
i
would
definitely
put
this
beer
in
my
rotation
o
this
is
1
it
was
extremely
good
but
not
sure
if
it
is
my
1
this
pours
out
with
a
murky
brown
color
with
some
orange
highlights
the
head
is
kind
of
minimals
but
has
a
little
white
ring
around
the
glass
the
smell
of
this
beer
is
very
good
lots
of
sweet
fruit
aromas
a
little
belgian
yeast
on
the
nose
not
much
in
way
or
hops
the
taste
is
very
good
the
flavors
of
apple
fig
and
white
grapes
all
come
together
in
a
very
nice
combo
when
the
beer
is
colder
the
mouthfeel
is
a
little
thicker
feeling
once
it
warms
up
it
thins
out
and
the
booze
aromas
start
to
show
the
beer
as
a
whole
is
very
good
its
incredibly
easy
to
drink
its
great
to
savor
over
the
course
an
hour
if
you
want
to
the
finish
is
dry
but
smooth
and
overall
just
really
nice
i
can
see
why
people
love
it
so
much
overall
a
very
nice
quad
not
sure
it
is
worth
the
hype
but
being
a
beer
geek
you
have
to
try
it
o
overall
i
can
def
see
why
this
is
world
class
amazing
beer
the
smell
was
a
blend
of
date
fig
sweet
brown
sugar
and
a
bready
yeastiness
the
taste
followed
right
along
with
where
the
nose
was
leading
but
stepped
up
the
complexity
with
additional
elements
a
peppery
spiciness
was
there
along
with
the
candied
dark
fruits
a
little
bit
of
a
vanilla
and
warming
alcohol
this
is
an
extremely
well
rounded
and
balanced
quad
flavor
the
feel
was
equally
as
pleasant
full
bodied
with
a
medium
amount
of
carbonation
the
finish
was
fantastic
and
imparted
no
harsh
alcohol
component
overall
this
was
a
real
treat
to
try
i
dont
know
if
after
one
bottle
im
ready
to
place
it
above
some
of
my
other
quad
favorites
st
b
rochefort
10
but
it
is
definitely
a
member
of
the
exclusive
group
of
top
tier
beers
of
this
style
o
i
love
this
beer
and
will
most
likely
be
iso
more
a
great
treat
glad
i
got
to
try
this
o
not
very
drinkable
but
tied
for
3
out
of
the
10
best
quads
would
do
much
better
with
some
age
i
opened
the
2010
bottle
that
i
had
and
really
am
a
fan
i
did
this
sidebyside
with
a
2003
bottle
and
much
preferred
the
newer
fresher
version
it
was
a
very
interesting
beer
definitely
had
a
ton
of
taste
and
some
fruit
flavor
to
it
it
was
very
strong
but
even
for
a
quad
i
didnt
get
a
strong
burn
or
anything
like
that
from
the
alcohol
i
am
interested
to
open
my
2008
and
do
a
test
of
the
middleoftheroad
version
this
beer
is
amazing
get
it
try
it
i
dont
think
its
my
favorite
but
its
very
delicious
and
complex
the
feel
on
this
is
nice
really
a
dry
beer
with
a
full
body
soft
carbonation
makes
this
one
really
nice
overall
this
is
clearly
a
well
made
beer
for
my
money
i
can
get
stuff
stateside
that
ill
be
just
as
happy
with
but
dont
get
me
wrong
this
one
is
a
rare
treat
that
ill
accept
anytime
o
one
of
the
best
beers
in
the
world
well
in
my
opinion
its
clearly
a
fantastic
beer
and
in
comparison
to
the
st
bernardus
its
very
similar
in
taste
and
smell
but
in
this
beer
the
smell
and
taste
are
so
much
stronger
when
it
comes
to
quads
this
one
is
very
nice
but
i
prefer
rochefort
10
may
i
just
express
my
disappointment
at
how
regular
this
was
for
the
top
beer
in
the
world
reviewed
blind
as
part
of
blind
bif
round
5
cap
reads
06

13
it
pours
a
dark
semicloudy
burnt
auburn
topped
by
a
healthy
tower
of
cream
foam
the
nose
comprises
dark
greens
black
pepper
clove
very
bready
yeast
nutmeg
figs
and
light
cocoa
the
taste
holds
notes
of
cinnamon
brown
sugar
clove
nutmeg
mild
milk
chocolate
belgian
yeast
light
citrus
peel
light
cardamom
dark
greens
candi
sugar
and
grass
the
body
is
a
heftyleaning
medium
with
a
lightish
moderate
carbonation
and
an
almost
astringently
chewily
dry
finish
overall
this
stuff
was
indeed
tasty
and
admittedly
a
little
young
but
it
felt
a
bit
wrong
on
my
tongue
honestly
i
generally
enjoyed
it
but
ive
had
plenty
of
better
quads
in
my
day
i
decided
to
review
this
beer
not
because
i
could
possibly
add
anything
others
have
not
already
but
because
this
beer
somehow
is
rated
the
same
as
pliny
the
younger
and
although
i
havent
had
that
beer
but
the
similarly
rated
elder
i
feel
there
has
to
be
some
justice
in
this
world
the
pliny
is
a
very
good
beer
i
must
admit
and
it
is
a
completely
different
beast
but
i
dont
think
it
inhabits
the
same
universe
as
westvleteren
westvleteren
is
a
perfect
beer
it
is
not
the
perfect
beer
but
it
is
imho
absolutely
great
it
is
just
so
perfectly
balanced
it
really
is
a
5
out
of
5
sort
of
a
beer
if
you
have
the
money
and
the
great
luck
to
find
it
somehow
you
must
try
it
overall
an
obviously
world
class
beer
not
sure
if
i
agree
that
its
the
best
in
the
world
but
it
is
good
would
grab
this
any
time
i
have
the
chance
overall
its
good
no
where
near
the
best
give
me
a
rochefort
10
and
call
it
a
day
verdict
unfortunately
this
doesnt
pass
even
the
second
tier
of
quads
i
have
had
and
unfortunately
its
not
the
monks
fault
as
this
is
simply
a
question
of
poor
storage
what
a
bummer
lots
of
chocolate
and
bready
yeast
i
am
surprised
by
the
amount
of
roast
this
has
a
bit
of
an
earthier
woody
tone
to
it
compared
to
the
st
bernardus
and
rochefort
body
is
just
about
right
not
quite
chewy
but
plenty
viscous
this
most
certainly
is
a
world
class
beverage
but
i
am
pretty
surprised
at
how
close
st
bernardus
comes
to
this
the
rochefort
came
in
a
distant
third
for
me
great
beer
cant
wait
to
try
one
in
belgium
one
of
these
days
pours
cloudy
amber
with
a
light
head
the
aroma
is
dark
fruits
and
malty
flavor
is
very
malty
with
a
sweet
finish
overall
a
very
good
belgium
quad
not
really
sure
if
it
deserves
the
number
1
overall
beer
but
thats
maybe
because
its
not
my
favorite
style
bottle
shared
by
colonelforbin
big
thanks
mike
bottled
on
15
december
2009
pours
a
cola
brown
with
a
small
light
that
has
very
good
retention
and
leaves
a
decent
amount
of
lacing
on
the
glass
a
little
big
of
yeast
can
be
seen
floating
in
it
aroma
is
big
dark
plum
raisin
light
brown
sugar
a
light
nuttiness
belgian
yeast
and
light
alcohol
the
taste
is
sweet
with
raisin
plum
brown
sugar
hints
of
nuts
no
alcohol
to
be
found
in
the
taste
medium
body
medium
carbonation
really
smooth
for
being
such
a
big
beer
a
very
good
beer
certainly
one
of
the
best
quads
i
had
i
wouldnt
say
it
was
one
of
my
personal
favorites
but
i
can
certainly
see
how
it
has
the
reputation
that
it
does
the
alcohol
came
through
on
the
palate
but
not
in
a
bad
way
what
an
awesome
brew
i
wish
i
had
a
case
of
this
o
overall
a
decent
beer
but
there
are
some
things
i
felt
it
was
lacking
i
wish
that
there
was
some
more
complexity
in
the
flavor
its
a
little
bit
like
a
glorified
malt
drink
more
dessert
wine
than
beer
i
also
found
the
body
a
little
watery
its
really
hard
to
believe
its
10
its
so
well
blended
that
it
tastes
nonalcoholic
od
i
cant
see
how
people
consider
this
the
best
tasting
beer
in
the
world
but
its
lovely
complexity
and
texture
are
world
class
its
amazingly
drinkable
wonderfully
smooth
and
flavourful
the
yeast
character
at
the
start
is
a
surpise
but
once
it
opens
up
it
becomes
a
great
complex
beer
it
seems
alot
more
yeasty
and
sugary
than
other
quads
probably
due
to
the
amount
of
candi
sugar
used
my
girlfriend
thought
it
was
the
best
beer
shed
ever
had
o
love
it
which
it
wasnt
so
hard
to
get
or
damn
expensive
d
easy
to
drink
and
would
drink
another
but
want
to
save
one
for
a
couple
years
not
the
beast
i
expected
but
a
shakespearean
achievement
of
fermentation
a
keystone
of
western
culture
taste
is
malty
sweet
candi
sugar
rum
notes
bready
plum
flavors
alcohol
is
very
well
hidden
nice
and
chewy
carbonation
is
perfect
some
banana
and
clove
with
some
spicy
characteristics
a
very
complex
beer
lots
going
on
here
a
real
treat
wish
i
could
drink
this
more
often
definitely
one
to
age
for
5
years
its
definitely
a
very
good
drink
and
well
worth
getting
your
hands
on
one
i
didnt
like
it
quite
as
much
as
the
8
but
its
probably
more
a
style
preference
than
anything
else
im
not
sure
exactly
how
old
the
bottle
was
at
least
4
months
and
probably
older
this
bottle
was
courtesy
of
lotsaswigs
thanks
eric
at
dld
the
bottle
was
from
08
it
poured
a
dark
raisin
brown
very
cloudy
with
a
light
cream
colored
head
the
head
was
ultimately
smooth
and
creamy
and
sat
atop
the
brew
in
such
a
delicate
manner
it
looked
exceptional
the
aromas
consisted
of
a
lot
of
yeast
bananas
cloves
freshly
baked
bread
and
it
had
a
sweet
and
dry
malty
finish
the
flavors
were
very
full
and
consisted
of
bananas
yeast
freshly
baked
bread
and
some
type
of
nut
hazelnut
perhaps
it
was
simply
delicious
it
was
very
full
in
body
and
quite
thick
it
was
also
exceptionally
smooth
wow
this
is
hands
down
the
best
quad
ive
ever
had
what
an
amazing
beer
thanks
again
eric
wow
overall
only
downside
was
price
worth
it
for
the
experience
overall
lived
up
to
the
hype
i
was
hoping
i
wouldnt
be
let
down
and
i
wasnt
i
would
call
this
the
best
beer
in
the
world
for
sure
o
sweet
and
thick
a
joyous
discovery
doesnt
get
much
better
the
reason
trappists
are
the
best
westy
12
you
have
my
heart
i
like
it
its
my
3rd
lash
at
the
12
and
i
hope
i
get
another
go
this
is
a
medium
bodied
brew
that
has
a
lively
prickly
level
of
carbonation
a
little
young
green
yeastiness
is
present
throughout
the
flavor
profile
this
is
more
herbal
and
bitter
than
i
was
expecting
with
hops
being
more
evident
than
i
would
prefer
but
regardless
it
is
balanced
well
and
enjoyable
i
couldnt
wait
any
longer
to
open
this
brew
and
finally
give
it
a
try
unfortunately
it
did
not
live
up
to
my
expectations
shame
on
me
for
opening
this
too
early
perhaps
i
will
need
to
acquire
a
vintage
bottle
and
revisit
my
review
i
paired
it
with
a
polyface
farms
fauxo
buco
adult
beef
shank
risotto
milanese
sugar
snap
peas
and
sour
cream
biscuits
an
excellent
pairing
but
not
perfect
the
beer
was
actually
a
bit
strong
for
the
food
it
could
stand
a
stronger
heartier
dish
but
it
does
love
the
garlictomato
stewed
meat
and
marrow
overall
this
is
a
textbook
quadrupel
it
was
not
however
markedly
better
than
the
neighboring
st
bernardus
i
understand
that
the
rarity
of
this
beer
may
drive
up
the
ratings
a
bit
and
thats
understandable
but
this
is
not
the
best
beer
or
even
quadrupel
i
have
had
it
was
however
fantastic
and
i
highly
recommend
trying
one
if
you
have
the
opportunity
to
visit
in
de
vrede
the
pilgrimage
is
worthwhile
d
if
i
could
procure
this
readily
i
would
drink
it
every
night
ahhhh
the
question
that
can
not
be
answered
is
this
the
best
beer
in
the
world
it
is
certainly
one
of
the
best
ive
ever
had
but
im
fairly
new
to
the
ticking
scene
so
i
dont
know
how
ill
ever
k
ow
unless
i
get
my
hands
on
a
case
and
can
compare
every
year
or
so
to
the
new
beers
ive
come
across
overall
wonderful
and
one
im
glad
to
have
ticked
purchased
this
at
de
bier
tempel
in
brussels
and
had
it
in
my
hotel
room
which
was
actually
equipped
with
a
bottle
opener
and
a
proper
beer
glass
this
beer
pours
deep
rubytinted
brown
with
a
huge
and
dense
fluffy
white
head
the
nose
is
malty
and
complex
with
notes
of
dark
dried
fruits
cocoa
honey
and
faint
spiciness
mouthfeel
is
creamy
and
smooth
and
the
taste
is
complex
with
more
dark
fruit
and
caramel
with
almost
portlike
flavours
alcohol
is
present
and
warming
but
not
hot
despite
the
abv
of
11
probably
not
the
best
beer
ive
ever
had
but
damn
good
not
quite
up
there
with
the
worlds
greatest
quad
rochefort
10
but
damn
it
came
close
onot
quite
the
greatest
beer
in
the
world
at
all
very
good
but
nothing
over
and
above
other
similar
of
the
style
i
feel
that
the
effort
for
this
one
is
too
much
for
the
reward
i
am
planning
another
trip
to
europe
this
year
so
maybe
i
will
get
to
belgium
and
who
knows
maybe
get
to
the
abbey
to
try
the
other
2
beers
they
produce
d
i
cannot
help
but
reiterate
that
i
think
this
is
one
of
the
most
balanced
beers
that
i
have
had
which
is
what
makes
this
beer
very
good
i
feel
that
i
could
drink
this
beer
for
any
occasion
and
probably
put
back
more
than
one
if
they
werent
so
expensive
this
is
definitely
a
beer
that
everyone
should
try
one
in
their
life
o
this
beer
is
good
obviously
well
crafted
multilayered
and
complex
unfortunately
i
disagree
it
stands
up
to
rochefort
10
oddly
given
the
last
review
i
did
of
that
beer
i
will
have
to
review
it
again
as
i
tasted
tonight
side
by
side
this
beer
and
found
it
in
the
forefront
drinkability
and
overall
impression
this
is
a
very
drinkable
beer
each
sip
follows
the
last
quite
naturally
and
easily
but
for
the
abv
i
could
sit
and
sip
on
this
beer
all
night
ill
certainly
be
willing
to
have
another
should
the
opportunity
arise
my
overall
impression
is
that
this
is
definitely
a
well
made
first
rate
beer
i
dont
know
that
id
say
its
the
best
in
the
world
but
it
well
deserves
to
be
right
up
there
in
competition
for
that
honor
overall
a
very
nice
beer
a
tad
light
for
the
style
and
not
a
holy
poop
this
is
great
beer
worth
the
adventure
to
secure
one
or
two
d
only
my
second
quad
and
this
is
by
far
the
better
of
the
two
didnt
like
my
first
quad
so
i
was
a
little
apprehensive
of
this
but
it
lived
up
to
expectations
as
a
great
beer
wish
i
had
the
opportunity
to
get
a
couple
and
enjoy
with
more
people
note
that
the
numeric
review
values
correspond
to
the
two
year
overall
this
beer
is
indeed
legendary
its
reputation
is
well
deserved
i
know
this
review
has
thusfar
seemed
as
if
ive
been
kissing
westvleterens
ass
due
to
the
hype
but
it
really
is
the
best
beer
ive
ever
tried
and
ive
just
tried
to
say
why
it
is
such
a
shame
that
this
beer
is
so
rare
because
it
is
a
real
treat
this
is
without
a
doubt
a
world
class
beer
i
wouldnt
have
been
able
to
tell
you
that
it
contained
over
10
alcohol
i
want
to
give
a
huge
thanks
to
brabander
for
sending
me
2
bottles
and
giving
me
the
chance
to
try
this
delicious
beer
hopefully
ill
be
able
to
try
it
again
next
year
when
im
in
belgium
cracked
two
of
these
on
my
50th
bday
in
february
poured
into
gabf
glass
taster
glasses
shared
with
my
girlfriends
youngest
son
poured
a
nice
dark
brownblack
with
a
nice
head
what
else
can
be
said
about
this
one
taste
was
fn
fantastic
to
put
it
mildly
id
honestly
have
to
say
that
this
wasis
the
best
beer
ive
had
to
date
split
two
ways
and
poured
into
my
chalice
great
two
finger
creamy
light
brown
head
with
good
retention
and
lacing
aromas
of
light
brown
sugar
molasses
caramel
toffee
dates
plums
and
cherries
taste
just
like
it
smells
with
a
dominant

smooth
best
beer
i
have
tasted
couldnt
find
a
single
flaw
overall
excellent
beer
if
you
like
good
beer
its
worth
trying
to
find
even
if
youre
an
ipa
or
stout
drinker

an
experience
worth
trying
at
least
once
if
you
like
strong
ales

very
probably
top
of
the
heap
o
overall
i
am
not
disappointed
one
bit
however
i
am
a
bit
surprised
on
the
booziness
of
this
beer
amazing
quad
best
beer
in
the
world
maybe
worldclass
definitely
id
really
love
to
try
one
that
has
some
solid
age
on
it
i
bet
it
would
be
insane
i
do
understand
all
the
comparisons
to
some
of
the
other
better
known
quads
and
i
do
understand
some
folks
choosing
other
quads
over
this
one
id
love
to
do
a
blind
test
next
to
some
of
my
other
favs
i
poured
from
a
11
2
oucne
bottle
into
a
snifter
the
pour
is
a
cloudy
caramel
with
a
massive
sticky
white
head
the
aroma
is
sweet
with
heavy
dark
fruit
notes
the
flavor
starts
with
sweet
plums
and
dates
it
rounds
out
with
an
almost
candy
like
sweetness
and
finishes
with
hot
alcohol
it
has
a
creamy
full
mouthfeel
nice
carbonation
the
beer
is
a
great
quad
definitely
world
class
very
glad
to
have
tried
it
i
feel
very
lucky
to
have
had
this
beer
more
than
once
during
my
trip
to
belgium
probably
one
of
my
favorite
beers
ever
and
im
usually
an
american
hops
kinda
guy
trade
more
of
this
with
me
and
ill
be
your
best
friend
cheers
drinkability
world
class
and
amzing
expereince
glad
to
have
tried
it
1200
i
turned
to
my
wife
and
said
this
is
without
question
the
best
beer
ive
ever
had
i
felt
vindicated
when
i
found
out
later
that
i
was
sampling
one
of
the
highest
rated
and
most
sought
after
beers
in
the
world
brought
a
couple
bottles
home
for
my
first
wedding
anniversary
and
i
cant
wait
to
drink
them
pours
a
a
very
dark
murky
red
little
head
or
lacing
aroma
is
hints
of
raisins
plums
prunes
and
figs
first
sip
super
smooth
tons
of
different
flavors
dance
around
cherries
mollasses
brown
sugar
raisins
and
even
a
hint
of
chocolate
each
sip
brings
all
of
these
and
others
all
perfectly
blended
and
smooth
to
sip
no
notice
of
the
booze
even
as
it
warms
mouthfeel
is
smooth
yet
still
a
little
crisp
not
cloying
at
all
a
beer
worth
waiting
for
the
cpj
o
highly
drinkable
but
not
what
i
expected
maybe
an
off
bottle
nice
beer
but
to
me
not
the
2
beer
in
the
world
d
goes
down
very
easily
with
the
crispness
overall
a
fantastic
beer
and
definitely
the
gold
standard
for
quads
my
dear
lord
this
beer
poured
with
a
perfect
beautiful
head
that
left
a
lace
that
was
almost
better
that
a
womans
dark
amber
brown
with
a
clarity
if
poured
with
the
retraction
move
utilized
on
most
belgians
with
internal
fermentation
it
almost
kills
me
to
wait
and
look
because
i
know
whats
next
the
flavor
is
outstanding
dare
i
say
epic
the
fact
that
it
pegs
the
meter
in
all
aspects
of
beer
flavors
while
at
the
same
time
maintaining
a
perfect
balancing
act
is
nothing
short
of
awesome
the
yeasty
flavor
coupled
with
the
hard
water
provide
the
backbone
for
the
dry
and
floral
flavors
that
dance
with
the
light
malt
and
hops
it
finishes
dry
and
satisfying
and
begs
you
to
open
another
with
its
tempting
warm
alcohol
in
the
back
of
the
throat
please
dont
hate
me
for
having
cases
of
this
beer
in
my
basement
when
i
lived
in
belgium
my
friends
belgian
wife
was
very
adept
at
acquiring
copious
amounts
of
this
platinum
liquid
this
is
my
favorite
beer
in
the
universe
and
has
been
for
over
ten
years
luxurious
brilliant
and
inviting
to
the
palette
whats
cool
is
that
the
taste
differs
slightly
between
a
sip
and
a
gulp
on
the
sip
i
get
a
refined
succulent
smooth
silky
grape
and
fig
personality
on
the
gulp
its
velvety
but
punchy
surrounded
by
black
cherry
malts
dark
candi
sugar
and
toffee
with
a
cream
soda
back
end
then
a
tremendously
dry
frothy
finish
whats
peculiar
is
that
not
a
single
profile
overpowers
the
other
i
think
what
makes
this
work
and
what
keeps
coming
to
mind
is
its
incredible
balance
its
complexity
shines
a
couple
of
sips
toward
the
end
it
turned
a
peppery
anise
and
even
floral
at
one
point
i
really
wish
this
bottle
wasnt
so
expensive
because
id
like
to
reexplore
this
beer
and
give
it
another
whirl
but
alas
my
hasty
dive
has
unfortunately
found
the
bottom
of
my
glass
and
to
be
honest
with
you
am
a
little
disheartened
that
i
cant
enjoy
more
of
this
magnificent
brew
westy
12
tastes
incredible
fresh
i
bet
its
even
better
aged
im
going
to
let
the
other
bottles
sit
in
the
cool
humid
darkness
for
another
year
and
come
back
to
let
you
know
how
the
flavors
marry
md
this
had
medium
amount
of
carbonation
which
allowed
a
lot
of
the
subtleties
to
be
appreciated
throughout
the
tasting
a
wellbalanced
and
complex
beer
i
would
love
to
let
there
be
some
age
on
the
beer
and
see
what
it
does
but
a
fresh
one
is
superb
so
i
cannot
complain
4
5
d
i
suppose
this
does
live
up
to
the
hype
its
an
excellent
brew
but
im
not
so
sure
that
its
that
much
better
that
easier
to
get
examples
still
quite
a
brew
thanks
goes
out
to
davolebomb
for
this
one
been
waiting
for
this
one
for
a
long
time
like
everyone
else
drinkin
it
with
him
right
now
poured
a
colachestnut
like
apperance
with
moderate
head
very
nice
amount
of
carbonation
that
gave
a
very
satisfying
tang
to
it
very
delicious
beer
prob
not
number
1
though
thats
what
its
title
proclaims
very
nice
spicy
fruity
taste
that
complements
the
smooth
creamy
maltiness
of
it
a
very
rich
package
all
together
i
wouldnt
prob
pay
this
much
again
for
the
beer
but
i
am
certainly
happy
i
was
able
to
have
it
finally
dwithout
a
doubt
this
beer
in
a
class
of
its
own
i
only
wish
id
could
be
able
to
drink
this
all
night
long
over
all
an
incredible
beer
that
i
was
glad
to
finally
try
cant
say
id
climb
any
mountains
to
get
this
again
but
i
certainly
wouldnt
say
no
if
one
happened
to
fall
in
my
lap
again
rereviewed
as
this
was
shared
among
a
variety
of
other
quads
as
part
of
the
quadshowdown
amazingly
out
of
13
quads
we
ranked
this
the
absolute
lowest
2010
vintage
poured
a
dark
brown
with
a
dark
cream
coloured
head
great
retention
and
a
bit
of
lace
nose
is
really
grapey
sweet
with
a
lot
of
welchs
grape
juiciness
some
sugary
notes
and
a
bit
of
vanilla
taste
reflects
the
nose
more
grape
and
welchs
some
balance
but
theres
just
a
great
amount
of
grape
juice
here
some
caramel
darker
fruits
and
sugar
but
not
alot
of
complexity
mediummedium
heavy
mouthfeel
with
a
bit
of
creaminess
with
some
lingering
saccharine
and
grape
notes
modest
but
feels
too
young
4435435
dis
it
better
than
the
rochefort
10
i
dont
think
so
still
this
is
fantastic
stuff
perfect
for
a
special
occasion
what
is
there
still
to
say
about
this
beer
that
was
not
said
before
maybe
that
fresh
this
beer
is
not
supposed
to
be
1
in
the
world
rochefort
10
and
sint
bernardus
abt
are
superior
fresh
at
least
to
my
opinion
with
a
little
bit
of
age
however
this
beer
becomes
by
far
the
best
quad
in
the
world
so
if
you
get
your
hands
on
a
bottle
be
patient
and
store
it
for
at
least
one
year
cheers
d
this
is
beer
you
drink
with
your
eyes
closed
you
want
to
experience
it
slowly
and
methodically
overall
this
beer
incredibly
complex
delicious
and
extremely
quaffable
the
best
example
of
the
style
that
ive
tried
and
one
of
the
best
beers
ive
ever
drank
not
my
favorite
style
and
definately
not
my
favorite
beer
but
this
is
by
far
my
favorite
beer
of
this
style
d
i
wish
i
had
another
and
another
i
wish
i
could
do
this
experience
justice
i
almost
didnt
write
a
review
there
is
a
general
warming
overall
but
the
alcohol
is
so
well
hidden
it
really
is
a
work
of
art
little
to
no
phenolic
aftertastes
just
a
great
amount
of
balance
in
the
beer
wonderful
o
second
time
ive
had
this
first
time
i
had
a
whole
bottle
to
myself
hype
has
been
lived
up
to
and
exceeded
two
times
now
this
is
the
real
deal
do
what
you
can
to
get
this
i
have
read
many
times
that
rochefort
10
and
st
bernardus
abt
12
are
good
substitutions
for
westy
12
i
have
had
both
on
multiple
occasions
and
could
not
disagree
more
there
is
no
substitute
for
this
beer
may
have
found
a
new
favorite
beer
masterfully
crafted
oh
and
uh
better
than
rochefort
10
pours
dark
mahogany
with
vibrant
ruby
red
tones
showing
in
the
light
tight
sticky
white
head
and
nice
lace
showing
along
the
glass
smells
of
subtle
alcohol
fig
brown
sugar
yeast
plum
raisin
cherry
faint
leathery
notes
dark
fruit
nose
is
stunning
on
this
one
tastes
of
yeast
dark
fruit
alcohol
toffee
vanilla
fig
plum
raisin
dark
sugar
and
something
almost
oak
like
that
are
behind
the
vanilla
notes
every
sip
of
this
opens
up
something
new
or
complimentary
medium
to
full
mouthfeel
that
is
smooth
as
silk
with
a
delicate
light
carbonation
dangerously
drinkable
abv
is
hidden
well
and
its
so
very
tasty
and
flavorful
does
it
live
up
to
its
hype
it
certainly
comes
close
maybe
the
best
ive
ever
had
and
absolutely
in
my
top
3
thanks
to
volo
for
doing
a
side
by
side
of
all
three
westys
that
was
an
amazing
idea
impression
the
finest
beer
ive
tasted
hope
to
taste
a
better
doubt
i
will
doubt
there
is
one
okay
the
hype
makes
more
sense
now
i
had
the
8
i
rated
it
highly
but
it
wasnt
mindblowing
this
beer
is
an
entirely
different
animal
quite
simply
this
are
masters
brewing
a
recipe
that
has
been
passed
down
from
masters
fantastic
so
deep
and
broad
yet
because
it
is
surprisingly
light
extremely
drinkable
find
it
if
you
can
it
will
be
worth
the
hassle
db
the
fresh
bread
and
yeast
profile
here
surely
make
this
one
a
treat
at
10
the
abv
is
a
ghost
and
this
one
drinks
dangerously
smoothly
i
could
easily
throwback
a
few
bottles
of
this
a
week
if
it
were
available
to
me
complex
but
balanced
mouthfeel
and
drinkability
to
me
are
the
true
highlights
of
this
beer
10
2
uh
whaaa
not
even
really
a
hint
of
that
present
light
extremely
smooth
and
a
bit
too
drinkable
even
as
it
warmed
to
about
room
temperature
this
only
improved
easy
to
drink
much
to
easy
to
drink
drinkability
this
might
be
sacrilegious
but
i
feel
i
money
were
no
object
that
this
would
be
my
session
beer
a
few
of
these
would
be
great
after
mowing
the
grass
d
i
could
sip
on
this
beer
all
night
long
great
flavors
and
great
mouthfeel
make
this
a
winner
i
will
be
seeking
this
out
for
future
green
bay
packer
super
bowl
celebrations
i
really
enjoyed
this
and
would
highly
recommend
it
thanks
again
to
urbancaver
for
his
generosity
pours
a
darker
brown
almost
like
brown
sugar
with
lots
of
frothy
head
very
very
pretty
smells
yeasty
and
flowery
lots
of
light
and
dark
fruity
flavours
tastes
very
smooth
and
clean
amazing
on
the
palette
especially
as
it
warms
up
a
slight
sharpness
and
hint
of
the
alcohol
content
but
very
drinkable
d
if
i
lived
in
belgium
i
would
drink
this
every
night
of
the
week
it
is
truly
amazing
only
if
maybe
my
expectations
were
too
high
maybe
my
palate
was
not
feeling
it
i
am
just
not
finding
what
makes
this
the
worlds
best
beer
pleasant
to
drink
i
am
not
sure
i
want
more
than
one
in
a
sitting
good
beer
worth
trying
atleast
once
in
your
lifetime
this
is
my
second
westy
12
and
although
its
a
very
good
beer
it
doesnt
strike
me
as
a
world
class
contender
very
good
but
not
worthy
of
all
the
hype
i
was
also
surprised
on
the
level
of
oxidation
poured
slightly
chilled
into
a
chalice
with
a
hazy
opaque
brown
body
hazelnut
color
with
lighter
tobacco
like
hues
around
the
edges
fluffy
tall
white
head
with
nice
retention
smells
like
figs
and
fine
cognac
bready
and
caramel
sweet
odors
in
the
nose
too
taste
is
raisin
and
fig
with
brown
sugar
and
slight
booze
sweet
and
caramel
malts
are
very
pronounced
with
a
slight
floral
background
very
clean
and
smooth
booze
is
not
very
apparent
in
taste
or
feel
silky
character
to
the
body
with
low
to
moderate
carbonation
this
beer
was
extremely
complex
and
balanced
rich
and
luxurious
and
just
downright
delicious
i
can
see
why
this
is
touted
as
the
best
beer
in
the
world
i
hope
that
i
get
the
chance
to
try
this
again
and
maybe
get
a
few
bottles
to
age
d
i
am
stunned
that
this
is
10abv
it
drinks
wonderfully
with
zero
alcohol
heat
the
dryness
in
the
finish
is
my
only
drinkability
related
criticism
lots
of
nuance
and
complexity
solid
beer
this
beer
deserves
its
status
as
one
of
the
best
the
best
who
knows
westy
12
is
a
dry
balanced
quad
and
this
is
what
makes
it
a
beautiful
beer
d
westy
12
and
hair
of
the
dog
adam
are
the
two
most
complex
and
interesting
beers
i
have
ever
had
there
is
a
refined
elegance
to
everything
about
this
beer
from
the
packaging
to
the
aroma
and
taste
o
overall
this
beer
is
insanely
good
i
just
wish
it
was
more
available
to
get
but
oh
well
i
would
recommend
that
any
who
likes
belgian
beers
especially
quads
and
strong
dark
ales
this
is
a
must
try
aroma
is
wildly
delicious
sweet
figs
in
honey
toffee
an
immediately
noticeable
vinous
presence
rum
sugars
candied
dates
a
rich
fresh
maple
syrup
is
announced
pour
is
deep
chestnut
brown
with
a
small
cobwebby
beige
head
a
highlyanticipated
first
sip
this
has
the
round
chewy
malt
of
st
bernardus
12
but
has
a
richer
fruit
presence
and
is
more
refined
creamy
wonderful
mouthfeel
just
beautifully
balanced
and
wellcrafted
as
with
rochefort
an
impression
of
overripe
banana
makes
itself
known
this
is
fucking
amazing
a
brilliant
spicy
note
like
cloves
cinnamon
and
cardamom
swirl
about
the
dark
fruits
and
rich
deep
alcoholic
sugars
i
dont
know
if
ive
ever
enjoyed
a
bottle
of
beer
this
much
if
my
tooth
wasnt
hurting
i
probably
would
have
enjoyed
it
even
more
shared
with
whiterascal
all
beer
connoisseurs
must
at
least
try
the
1
rated
beer
in
the
world
excellent
worthy
to
note
that
there
was
no
eureka
moment
upon
first
sipping
it
but
as
you
drink
the
brew
really
opens
up
hands
down
a
world
class
beer
but
the
best
hmm
not
sure
i
could
give
any
beer
that
distinction
were
rochefort
10
as
difficult
to
come
by
i
think
it
would
marshall
a
similar
hype
that
said
its
easily
a
top
5
candidate
in
my
book
will
be
doing
a
side
by
side
with
rochefort
10
later
this
week
to
determine
which
i
like
better
right
now
its
pretty
up
in
the
air
i
would
have
liked
more
of
an
emphasis
on
the
dark
fruits
in
the
taste
but
the
presence
of
other
nice
flavors
certainly
makes
up
i
figured
the
best
beer
in
the
world
would
be
more
mind
blowing
but
this
is
more
cerebral
it
doesnt
stand
out
in
any
one
way
but
it
seems
a
great
exercise
in
balance
dont
get
me
wrong
its
strong
but
restrained
this
beer
is
almost
scary
drinkable
as
it
goes
down
so
easy
with
almost
zero
hint
of
alcohol
in
my
opinion
the
westy
12
deserves
every
bit
of
hype
that
it
gets
im
very
luckythankful
to
have
a
chance
to
try
this
beer
pours
a
deep
brown
with
an
inch
of
foamy
offwhite
head
on
top
this
beer
is
not
black
but
you
cant
see
anything
through
the
glass
lots
of
lacing
on
the
sides
of
my
glass
as
i
lift
it
to
drink
i
love
the
smell
of
the
belgian
yeast
in
this
beer
it
smells
like
a
really
sweet
apple
cider
lots
going
on
with
the
flavor
of
this
beer
but
i
taste
lots
of
sugary
apple
flavored
yeast
there
are
also
some
slight
hints
of
dark
fruit
and
a
nutty
finish
the
mouthfeel
is
medium
bodied
but
with
a
lively
feeling
of
carbonation
there
is
hint
of
alcohol
in
the
aftertaste
everything
about
this
beer
was
great
and
with
the
exception
of
the
mouthfeel
i
hardly
noticed
any
of
the
alcohol
presence
i
would
drink
this
again
or
consecutively
if
it
were
readily
available
only
place
i
was
let
down
was
mouthfeel
ive
come
to
enjoy
carbonation
and
was
slightly
disappointed
to
each
their
own
full
bodied
creamy
and
very
smooth
has
a
certain
lightness
to
it
soft
alcohol
heat
shows
up
and
lingers
long
past
the
finish
10
abv
tasted
on
selfproclaimed
westy
day
010611
with
my
craft
beer
aficionado
buddy
this
quad
made
of
perfection
was
bottled
in
2010
with
date
stamped
15
10
13
on
cap
and
given
the
title
baby
westy
by
us
because
of
its
perfection
from
birth
currently
ranked
the
worlds
best
beer
gave
off
an
opaque
browncopper
appearance
as
you
drink
it
you
see
many
different
layers
of
color
multilayered
complex
smell
hints
of
belgium
candy
sugar
mouthability
and
drinkability
gave
off
a
smooth
and
perfect
balance
i
could
taste
caramel
raisins
licorice
figs
maybe
hint
of
orange
peels
and
candied
sugar
additional
notes
a
beer
beyond
measure
and
perfection
now
we
can
fully
measure
taste
of
all
beers
going
forward
now
that
weve
had
a
westy
12
by
drinking
the
westy
12
i
wouldnt
mind
joining
the
st
sixtus
monastery
humbling
experience
me
i
feel
buzzed
already
friend
no
its
probably
the
euphoria
of
drinking
this
beer
this
is
a
heavenly
task
that
i
would
totally
kill
someone
if
he
drank
it
down
in
one
big
gulp
the
westy
12
is
indeed
the
holy
grail
of
beers
o
great
beer
but
not
the
worldchanger
that
the
hype
makes
it
out
to
be
there
are
just
too
many
easilyobtainable
beers
in
this
category
that
are
close
to
it
in
quality
for
me
to
work
this
hard
for
another
one
well
if
i
lived
next
to
the
brewery
or
even
within
200
miles
this
might
be
the
best
beer
ever
but
i
dont
so
it
isnt
if
i
did
live
that
close
i
cant
honestly
say
that
a
saison
strong
pale
or
dark
or
a
really
nice
triple
wouldnt
tempt
me
to
stray
really
belgium
has
all
the
super
model
beers
however
this
is
by
far
the
best
quad
i
have
ever
had
and
would
love
to
drink
it
again
someday
so
is
it
the
greatest
beer
in
the
world
thats
hard
to
say
it
certainly
has
an
appeal
to
it
due
to
the
rarity
and
trouble
taken
to
get
it
but
im
not
sure
if
that
should
be
taken
into
account
too
much
in
my
opinion
its
an
incredible
beer
but
i
think
i
let
the
hype
get
to
me
a
bit
and
was
expecting
a
bit
more
i
have
a
few
more
bottles
so
hopefully
in
a
few
years
ill
revisit
this
beer
cheers
drinkability
spinrsx
and
i
had
this
debate
but
i
think
this
is
a
well
rounded
beer
and
brings
complexity
to
the
menu
this
is
something
that
was
more
of
an
investment
and
a
sample
but
if
i
could
drink
it
daily
i
would
love
too
drink
im
happy
i
got
to
check
this
beer
off
my
want
list
im
sure
the
fact
that
it
is
hard
to
get
adds
to
the
hype
and
positive
reviews
but
it
really
is
a
must
try
and
a
fantastic
beer
andor
rochefort
10
only
had
them
fresh
before
i
truly
make
the
call
any
which
way
it
is
a
phenomenal
beer
pours
a
murky
amberbrown
with
a
rocky
offwhite
head
smells
of
wine
peppery
yeast
wheat
spice
kind
of
like
hopped
up
bitburger
taste
is
subdued
sweet
but
not
in
your
face
i
get
some
cola
toffee
white
wine
hop
bitterness
on
the
very
back
that
is
barely
there
some
clove
spice
mellow
flavor
for
sure
i
like
the
mellowness
of
this
compared
to
similar
brews
with
inyourface
spice
that
makes
me
wish
i
was
drinking
something
else
carbonation
is
high
and
mouthfeel
isnt
thick
at
all
very
drinkable
as
the
sugars
arent
cloying
the
pepperclove
character
seems
to
cleans
that
sugar
overload
from
the
palate
drinkability
was
marked
down
to
the
exclusivity
of
this
if
i
could
find
it
down
the
street
i
would
sit
through
a
sixer
of
it
and
crawl
on
my
lips
to
my
bed
a
decent
beer
indeed
but
nothing
id
trade
something
special
out
of
my
cellar
for
verdict
the
best
of
the
belgian
styles
that
i
have
tried
thus
far
but
certainly
not
a
game
changer
for
me
d
it
is
high
in
alcohol
therefore
you
wont
be
drinking
a
lot
of
these
at
one
sitting
however
aside
from
the
high
alcohol
it
is
one
of
the
most
drinkable
belgian
beers
i
have
tried
wonderful
5
d
incredibly
drinkable
for
its
alcohol
content
gives
an
experience
that
is
truly
unique
and
fulfilling
in
all
beer
drinking
aspects
mdthis
is
as
good
as
you
have
heard
so
stop
reading
and
try
to
get
one
overall
a
really
great
beer
and
possibly
my
favorite
of
this
style
i
didnt
expect
this
to
be
my
number
one
beer
of
all
time
but
i
definitely
enjoyed
it
immensely
im
really
happy
to
have
tried
this
and
crossed
it
off
my
beer
bucket
list
d
extremely
drinkable
especially
for
a
beer
of
this
strength
id
give
it
a
6
if
i
could
in
this
category
overall
this
is
a
terrific
beer
and
most
certainly
the
best
quad
i
have
ever
tasted
seems
more
restrained
then
most
bug
belgians
which
is
nice
this
is
a
great
beer
a
quadrupel
that
i
can
drink
all
night
i
wish
i
had
enough
to
do
that
i
had
this
at
a
tasting
with
westy
8
as
well
and
i
found
it
interesting
that
this
was
less
boozy
than
that
is
this
worthy
of
the
title
of
best
beer
in
the
world
thats
for
you
to
decide
but
ill
doubt
youll
call
it
anything
but
a
great
beer
regardless
d
very
this
thing
is
10
2
abv
so
be
careful
d
the
milliondollar
question
is
this
the
best
beer
on
earth
first
off
i
should
note
that
my
bottle
was
pretty
young
and
still
had
some
heat
on
it
i
think
it
would
improve
with
age
anyway
this
was
an
excellent
beer
and
i
feel
privileged
for
having
had
a
chance
to
drink
it
whether
its
the
best
is
of
course
subjective
but
id
definitely
put
it
in
the
conversation
however
rochefort
10
did
just
a
little
bit
more
for
me
honestly
though
all
the
elite
trappist
beers
are
superlative
in
their
own
way
i
am
not
discounting
how
good
this
beer
was
especially
in
the
face
of
so
many
horrible
canquest
tm
beers
but
neither
did
i
hear
the
singing
of
angels
or
have
any
sort
of
religious
experience
price
alone
hurts
the
score
here
i
could
drink
this
all
day
slowly
but
all
day
now
obviously
i
cant
answer
the
question
about
whether
this
is
the
best
beer
in
the
world
thats
a
completely
subjective
question
i
can
do
a
little
better
by
comparing
it
to
other
quads
i
would
need
to
taste
them
sidebyside
a
few
times
to
really
make
up
my
mind
but
my
first
instinct
is
that
i
like
st
bernardus
abt
12
a
tiny
bit
better
but
if
youre
a
belgian
beer
fan
or
any
sort
of
beer
fan
at
all
really
westy
12
is
worth
at
least
some
of
the
hype
and
is
an
absolute
musttry
edit
upped
the
overall
a
bit
as
i
take
into
account
the
beer
experience
one
part
of
that
for
me
is
availability
and
this
one
seems
to
have
become
increasingly
more
available
wish
i
could
rate
this
a
5
but
i
cant
if
it
was
easy
to
find
cheaper
and
a
little
lower
abv
id
rate
this
a
5
even
with
the
high
abv
the
booze
is
hidden
really
well
it
is
still
there
in
the
nose
and
taste
but
not
as
strong
as
i
thought
i
will
definitely
be
going
out
of
my
way
to
try
and
grab
more
of
these
definitely
an
a
beer
that
lives
up
to
the
hype
medium
to
full
bodied
and
perfectly
carbonated
i
can
taste
some
of
the
alcohol
but
there
is
no
alcohol
burn
at
all
the
alcohol
is
definitely
warming
though
this
is
also
a
smooth
and
creamy
beer
drinking
beer
does
not
get
any
better
than
this
the
drinkability
is
off
the
charts
and
i
must
seek
this
out
again
d
an
insanely
well
crafted
beer
here
the
fact
they
can
pull
off
flavors
like
this
without
any
flashy
ingredients
is
just
mind
boggling
just
cant
begin
to
describe
how
complex
yet
delicately
constructed
this
one
is
a
real
treat
and
worthy
of
its
own
special
occasion
cheers
to
the
monks
of
st
sixtus
for
this
one
sweet
roasted
malts
fruits
flavours
and
the
great
belgian
yeast
feeling
medium
body
with
lots
of
light
bubbled
carbonation
that
sweeps
gently
across
your
tongue
a
drinkable
and
inviting
beer
but
flavor
wise
isnt
as
impressive
as
i
had
hoped
pours
a
deep
brown
almost
black
with
a
light
quickly
dissipating
head
for
such
a
highly
touted
beer
i
was
surprised
how
the
taste
was
very
subtle
the
appearance
makes
you
think
thats
its
really
full
but
thats
not
the
case
i
was
initially
disappointed
in
the
flavors
but
grew
to
appreciate
it
as
i
drank
more
i
noticed
the
chocolate
and
light
roasted
grain
flavor
at
the
outset
the
real
strength
of
this
beer
for
me
was
on
the
back
end
epic
thanks
to
beerwolf77
for
sharing
this
is
great
beyond
question
it
is
the
best
beer
i
have
had
so
far
but
i
think
that
there
are
a
very
very
small
percentage
of
better
beers
out
there
but
for
now
long
live
the
king
d
taste
is
magnificent
abv
be
damned
i
could
drink
this
all
night
there
are
so
many
magical
fables
that
we
cant
reach
out
and
touch
if
as
a
child
you
ever
longed
for
brigadoon
narnia
middle
earth
or
neverland
to
be
real
go
through
the
motions
and
acquire
a
bottle
of
this
beer
its
worth
the
trouble
to
reaffirm
your
sense
of
humility
and
wonder
in
the
world
great
way
to
spend
a
lunch
break
i
dont
think
this
is
the
best
beer
ive
ever
had
but
i
am
very
appreciative
of
the
rare
opportunity
to
try
it
heres
to
the
last
sip
overall
this
is
one
amazing
quad
but
rochefort
10
does
compare
favorably
as
do
a
few
other
quads
and
belgian
strong
darks
it
earns
its
reputation
as
the
holy
grail
of
beer
by
the
means
needed
to
get
a
taste
of
it
but
once
it
has
been
tasted
your
efforts
could
be
better
used
for
more
reasonable
endeavors
i
am
so
happy
to
have
had
it
though
and
now
need
to
decide
when
and
where
to
open
the
second
bottle
and
now
my
glass
is
empty
sigh
d
simply
incredible
something
i
could
drink
on
a
regular
basis
if
i
had
the
access
to
it
warms
you
up
and
doesnt
disappoint
overall
delicious
beer
a
little
bit
alcoholic
but
for
a
10
its
very
bearable
multi
layered
excellent
glad
i
finally
got
to
try
this
very
good
great
even
but
i
think
the
other
trappist
quads
are
comparable
looking
forward
to
seeing
how
other
bottles
age
really
enjoyed
this
one
cant
wait
to
get
the
next
we
were
gifted
a
bottle
of
12
from
a
long
time
dutch
friend
we
wonder
if
the
beer
had
undergone
temp
changes
because
it
did
not
have
a
lot
of
carbonation
but
this
was
truly
the
best
we
have
ever
had
it
is
a
dom
of
the
beer
world
it
has
a
smooth
sweet
flavor
with
a
nice
smell
o
i
think
i
bought
a
defective
bottle
very
disappointing
im
sure
that
this
one
can
perform
better
but
ill
need
to
come
back
and
revise
when
i
get
a
chance
to
sample
the
beer
again
hopefully
for
christmas
d
alcohol
level
almost
undetectable
evident
in
the
taste
somewhat
but
not
in
the
drinkability
the
experience
goes
way
too
fast
appearance
is
dark
brownchestnust
in
color
with
a
creamy
tan
head
complex
aromas
of
dark
fruits
followed
by
belgian
yeast
spice
notes
and
dark
fruity
malts
tastses
as
it
smells
with
and
amazingly
smooth
and
well
rounded
flavor
profile
a
sacred
brew
worthy
of
sacred
appreciation
full
body
with
medium
carbonation
and
semi
creamy
mouthfeel
surprisingly
drinkable
at
10
abv
i
personally
enjoyed
the
westy
8
better
than
the
12
but
i
am
curious
to
try
both
again
and
take
some
detailed
notes
beautiful
balance
the
fruit
flavors
are
nearly
perfect
it
does
have
a
slight
alcohol
tinge
near
the
end
2003
vintage
ive
been
lucky
enough
to
try
this
several
times
but
this
is
actually
the
first
time
ive
ever
had
one
in
my
possession
they
always
get
cracked
at
tastings
but
its
never
found
its
way
into
my
possession
my
willpower
lasted
about
2
months
before
i
i
was
forced
to
crack
it
open
the
beer
pours
a
muddy
brown
with
just
a
bit
of
a
head
that
leaves
no
lacing
actually
the
heads
kind
of
ugly
big
fish
eye
bubbles
no
lacing
the
aroma
is
chocolate
and
dark
fruits
sweet
maraschino
cherries
with
toffee
a
hint
of
booze
nails
the
flavor
is
fairly
similar
pure
coco
powder
up
front
with
date
and
fig
big
sweet
cherries
with
dark
fruits
caramel
and
toffee
with
just
a
hint
of
toast
just
a
bit
of
sweet
molasses
the
mouthfeel
is
honestly
the
worst
part
of
the
beer
it
honestly
a
bit
thin
i
dont
know
if
its
the
prolonged
aging
that
has
thinned
out
the
body
but
its
not
quite
what
i
remember
overall
this
beer
is
fantastic
theres
really
not
much
more
then
that
a
big
thanks
again
to
thijs
for
the
hookup
saving
my
other
bottle
to
do
a
quad
comparison
tasting
had
it
again
two
days
later
side
by
side
with
rochefort
10
st
bernardus
12
rochefort
8
chimay
blue
cuvee
van
de
keizer
blauw
and
trois
pistoles
although
i
am
rating
westvleteren
12
higher
than
rochefort
10
its
only
because
of
better
looks
and
absence
of
alcohol
in
aroma
these
two
although
very
different
are
just
as
good
as
each
other
in
my
opinion
my
taste
preferences
lean
more
towards
rochefort
10
which
is
a
good
thing
because
thats
way
easier
to
come
by
body
is
silky
smooth
wellcarbonated
but
not
bubbly
full
and
creamy
but
not
overly
thick
a
warming
dose
of
booze
comes
through
on
the
swallow
accentuating
the
complexity
of
the
beer
on
the
whole
this
is
just
a
masterpiece
i
wish
it
were
easier
to
obtain
but
i
understand
and
appreciate
why
it
is
not
cheers
drinkabilityits
a
really
easily
drinkable
flavorful
complex
and
smooth
beer
a
very
good
beer
but
seems
to
me
that
rarity
and
hype
have
pushed
this
one
to
extreme
heights
still
have
several
other
bottles
so
will
try
again
and
revise
scores
if
my
opinion
changes
d
very
smooth
and
creamy
nicely
balanced
good
carbonation
i
could
drink
this
al
day
long
alcohol
is
very
well
hidden
nb
i
would
like
to
revisit
this
beer
again
when
i
can
be
sure
that
i
am
not
tasting
a
compromised
sampling
enjoyable
despite
that
though
it
drinks
very
smoothly
and
very
well
its
not
sticky
at
all
either
and
no
off
flavors
i
could
easily
pound
this
like
its
water
if
it
didnt
taste
so
good
again
the
only
thing
that
hurts
it
a
bit
is
the
lack
of
carbonation
the
body
is
full
and
creamy
without
being
too
heavy
or
overwhelming
it
works
nicely
with
the
carbonation
and
the
flavors
to
create
a
sublime
drinking
experience
while
i
am
not
completely
blown
away
this
is
still
a
phenomenal
beer
i
do
wish
it
was
easier
to
obtain
as
this
is
a
topnotch
bsdaquad
that
certainly
sets
the
bar
high
for
the
style
d
theres
a
reason
its
1
of
ba
its
pretty
amazing
while
it
isnt
the
1
beer
on
my
list
its
safe
to
say
its
high
on
my
list
the
good
news
is
that
the
taste
and
smell
are
the
highlights
of
this
beer
both
are
complex
and
enjoyable
while
the
high
carbonation
hurt
the
mouthfeel
a
bit
the
smell
and
taste
are
amazing
it
also
definitely
helps
to
let
this
one
warm
up
a
bit
so
you
can
fully
appreciate
everything
in
the
nose
and
mouth
if
you
like
quads
i
think
it
is
safe
to
say
youll
love
this
beer
i
was
also
surprised
how
easy
it
was
to
drink
and
how
little
alcohol
was
noticable
in
the
taste
i
think
i
like
this
slightly
better
than
westy
8
but
its
close
i
look
forward
to
aging
my
other
2
bottles
and
see
how
they
do
with
even
more
time
on
them
mouthfeel
wonderful
if
i
had
more
bottles
theyd
be
gone
but
then
id
be
on
the
floor
because
the
10
2
abv
can
be
felt
but
not
tasted
this
is
good
cus
i
love
grape
juice
but
really
this
is
a
bit
overrated
i
highly
preferred
the
westy
8
to
this
i
would
love
to
try
this
fresh
at
12
years
old
terrible
at
2
years
old
good
whats
fresh
like
this
could
become
a
perfect
5
if
it
balances
even
more
with
age
and
if
the
aromas
would
be
a
bit
more
pronounced
but
proud
to
be
belgian
d
likely
the
most
drinkable
10
2
beer
in
the
world
this
one
really
earns
its
accolades
incredible
balance
and
complexity
with
a
mouthfeel
that
really
pulls
it
all
together
nose
is
impeccable
and
even
looks
great
definitely
one
to
try
and
seek
out
and
very
much
worthy
of
the
praise
found
this
in
a
small
bar
in
brussels
for
10
euro
i
was
pumped
just
to
have
one
anyhow
they
had
two
and
i
cannot
believe
i
found
this
there
it
was
deliciou
even
though
not
my
favorite
style
it
was
truely
delicious
i
shared
the
other
bottle
with
my
buddy
in
paris
overall
a
very
nice
quad
but
i
didnt
find
it
completely
mindblowing
worth
trying
for
sure
but
more
for
the
experience
than
the
beer
i
think
this
was
an
amazing
beer
i
am
not
worldly
enough
to
say
best
beer
or
not
but
it
was
an
amazing
beer
and
i
feel
fortunate
to
get
to
try
one
not
awesome
but
it
was
good
i
wouldnt
go
out
of
my
way
to
try
it
again
but
am
glad
i
did
drink
into
the
hype
machine
at
least
once
and
have
another
in
the
cellar
to
age
and
review
again
but
as
many
have
said
st
b
12
isnt
that
too
far
off
if
not
better
bottle
date
on
the
cap
of
08
01
11
so
bottled
in
2008
i
believe
pours
a
hazed
deep
mahagony
reddish
brown
color
with
a
slighlty
off
white
head
some
sediment
evident
in
the
glass
a
solid
mix
of
aromas
in
the
nose
including
fruit
like
raisins
spice
and
alcohol
also
get
plums
in
the
nose
medium
mouthfeel
with
some
carbonation
that
dances
across
the
tongue
dark
fruits
and
subtle
sweetness
dominate
the
flavor
some
evidence
of
the
alcohol
in
the
taste
pretty
smooth
and
exceptional
tasting
other
flavors
that
i
can
pick
out
include
molasses
and
caramel
nice
sweetness
left
in
the
mouth
after
your
drink
so
how
does
the
1
beer
in
the
world
rate
its
hard
to
imagine
how
any
such
beer
can
be
1
for
me
this
is
a
great
very
smooth
drinking
well
made
beer
for
sure
the
fact
that
you
can
only
get
it
from
the
monastery
has
to
come
into
effect
in
where
it
is
on
the
list
overall
i
really
like
this
beer
its
really
tasty
but
i
couldnt
drink
it
all
the
time
give
it
up
to
the
monks
for
making
this
one
dont
get
me
wrong
this
was
very
delicious
but
to
me
beer
is
graded
by
flavor
construction
and
sensations
this
beer
just
didnt
peak
where
i
had
expected
it
to
and
hence
the
problem
with
knowing
the
hype
i
would
still
give
the
westy
very
high
grades
just
not
in
the
elite
class
that
being
said
two
of
my
friends
satting
at
the
table
has
each
had
a
westy
12
before
and
they
both
claimed
that
this
tasted
different
so
will
not
make
a
conclusion
on
this
beer
until
i
have
had
another
and
the
hunt
continues
the
beer
is
clear
and
has
a
amber
brown
color
the
head
is
tan
and
very
bubbly
there
is
a
sweet
semidry
fruit
that
makes
up
the
aroma
it
smells
like
some
sort
of
berry
but
not
one
that
i
can
identify
if
i
knew
what
it
was
id
go
out
and
buy
a
pint
the
flavor
is
big
but
not
overbearing
there
is
some
toasted
malt
and
noticeable
alcohol
the
malts
are
sweet
but
never
too
much
so
they
impart
a
hint
of
strawberries
that
is
most
enjoyable
after
each
swallow
the
warmth
of
the
alcohol
lingers
on
and
keeps
you
company
until
you
bring
the
glass
back
to
your
lips
it
has
a
medium
body
and
plenty
of
carbonation
swishing
it
about
my
mouth
the
beer
foams
up
quite
a
bit
i
could
easily
drink
a
lot
of
this
at
least
until
the
alcohol
caught
up
with
me
it
doesnt
feel
or
taste
like
a
10
abv
beer
at
all
this
is
truly
a
world
class
beer
nearly
everything
about
it
sets
the
standard
for
which
quads
should
be
judged
as
i
said
above
westy
12
is
worth
all
of
the
praise
it
gets
but
i
must
agree
that
there
are
some
beers
easier
to
obtain
that
come
close
to
its
greatness
see
st
bernardus
12
and
it
deserves
your
attention
d
a
very
very
good
beer
maybe
a
bit
too
sweet
to
drink
a
lot
of
at
a
time
but
such
a
good
flavor
that
you
might
make
a
bit
of
an
exception
d
ok
so
its
very
drinkable
i
was
super
exited
to
try
it
however
i
think
if
it
were
easier
to
obtain
it
might
not
hold
the
position
of
top
beer
in
the
world
something
to
be
said
for
having
to
call
the
monastery
for
an
appt
hoping
you
get
through
and
then
picking
it
up
a
treat
to
try
for
sure
overall
this
was
a
very
good
beer
but
i
hope
maybe
someday
i
will
be
able
to
obtain
a
bottle
with
some
age
on
it
to
enjoy
more
pronounced
flavors
an
aromas
thanks
to
don
for
bringing
this
one
to
an
epic
tasting
poured
into
a
generic
tulip
nice
off
white
head
high
retention
soapy
lacing
aroma
of
caramel
brown
sugar
molasses
and
raisins
taste
is
perfect
malt
sweetness
no
alcohol
warming
and
effing
amazing
flawless
in
every
way
shape
and
form
have
had
this
many
times
with
bottles
dating
back
to
the
mid
1990s
this
review
comes
from
my
first
time
having
the
beer
with
a
bottle
marked
28
03
10
it
pours
with
a
offwhite
head
that
goes
with
time
and
leaves
some
waves
covering
a
murky
brown
body
with
particles
alcohol
legs
on
the
side
of
the
glass
amazing
aroma
of
figs
dark
fruits
raisins
chocolate
alcohol
brandy
and
a
slightly
tart
plum
taste
is
sweet
lighter
than
expected
with
complex
rich
and
spiciness
there
is
a
complex
savory
alcohol
note
on
the
finish
that
is
beautiful
along
with
a
long
clean
and
pleasant
after
taste
brandy
spicy
sweet
yeasty
and
fruit
there
is
so
much
in
this
beer
it
is
subtly
amazing
syrupy
mouthfeel
with
really
light
bubbles
this
beer
quietly
lives
up
to
all
expectations
is
it
the
best
beer
in
the
world
probably
not
but
it
sure
is
an
excellent
one
the
beer
appears
deep
burgundy
tinged
brown
with
a
large
frothy
beige
head
the
aroma
displays
a
complex
and
complimentary
sherrylike
oxidation
quality
this
aged
iteration
is
reminiscent
of
a
fine
port
with
notes
of
ripe
plum
and
prominent
cherries
its
somewhat
nutty
with
an
effusion
of
caramel
dates
and
prunes
the
flavor
is
rich
and
malty
with
sherry
oxidation
and
a
touch
of
cardboard
just
a
touch
notes
of
ripe
cherries
accompany
dates
prunes
and
a
strong
caramel
profile
the
beer
is
highly
carbonated
with
a
smooth
and
creamy
mouthfeel
and
noticeable
alcohol
warming
a
rare
aged
treat
thanks
d
this
is
a
beer
that
makes
you
want
to
raise
your
arms
in
joy
the
best
beer
in
the
world
im
not
sure
about
that
but
in
my
opinion
the
best
trappist
o
this
beer
does
get
a
lot
better
with
age
the
port
like
flavours
begin
to
emerge
at
three
years
old
i
will
review
again
in
a
couple
of
years
time
this
beer
cannot
be
beaten
i
know
some
people
are
dissapointed
when
they
first
tsate
this
beer
because
they
are
used
to
massive
bourbon
barrel
aged
stouts
that
are
dominated
by
a
particular
flavour
or
two
this
beer
challenges
the
need
for
massive
flavours
by
taking
you
on
a
journey
of
subtleness
and
balance
that
for
me
is
the
pinnacle
of
brewing
a
meal
for
the
soul
a
real
treat
thick
rich
complicated
like
a
real
frersh
fortified
sherry
wine
from
jerez
de
la
frontierea
spain
come
with
a
clean
slate
and
come
mentally
prepared
d
the
alcohol
is
nearly
unoticeable
at
first
but
comes
out
a
bit
as
the
beer
warms
i
could
literally
drink
this
every
day
and
never
get
tired
of
it
it
really
is
too
bad
that
alas
i
only
have
one
bottle
this
is
the
very
definition
of
a
world
class
beer
i
will
certainly
be
seeking
out
more
of
it
opened
the
homebrewed
version
makes
me
appreciate
the
real
thing
much
more
the
homebrew
is
actually
less
sweet
but
more
oxidized
darker
color
and
especially
darker
head
loving
the
original
overall
just
an
amazing
beer
looking
over
my
review
i
realize
im
running
out
of
adjectives
to
describe
how
great
it
is
worthy
of
the
accolades
and
praise
the
most
wonderful
special
and
unique
beer
in
the
world
period
drinks
incredibly
while
i
want
to
really
wait
it
out
and
savor
it
the
beer
goes
down
so
easily
its
scary
the
complexity
brings
something
new
and
exciting
to
each
sip
twelves
renown
is
indeed
deserved
overall
westvleteren
12
is
worth
its
praise
however
i
still
hold
rochefort
10
as
its
superior
mfd
faint
soothing
sizzle
of
carbonation
fizzles
to
a
smooth
finish
foam
coats
the
lips
certainly
didnt
want
to
drink
anything
but
w12
afterwards
i
think
that
i
will
age
most
or
all
of
my
remaining
bottles
this
is
a
great
beer
no
doubt
but
i
have
had
it
when
its
been
better
i
do
have
two
7yearold
bottles
sitting
at
home
maybe
i
will
try
one
of
them
soon
and
refresh
my
memory
how
it
ages
regardless
fresh
or
not
this
beer
truly
is
great
drinking
this
beer
is
an
experience
to
say
the
least
it
almost
transports
you
to
some
medieval
monastery
where
monks
in
tattered
robes
stand
around
woodfired
copper
kettles
stirring
and
sampling
with
large
wooden
oars
highly
recommended
worth
the
time
spent
salivating
excellence
thank
you
again
to
the
ba
who
put
this
into
my
hands
thank
you
from
the
bottom
of
a
well
enjoyed
glass
coiuldnt
have
enjoyed
it
more
o
to
be
a
quad
i
think
this
needed
a
little
more
oomph
not
as
viscous
as
i
would
have
thought
a
quad
to
resemble
to
style
but
yet
still
delicious
its
ok
picked
up
at
the
monastery
and
stamped
16

13
this
beer
pours
dark
brown
with
a
little
amber
on
the
edges
of
the
glass
it
started
with
about
an
inch
of
head
and
reduced
to
about
a
quarter
inch
that
stays
with
the
beer
throughout
the
smell
starts
with
the
malt
with
a
hint
of
something
sweet
and
is
followed
by
the
yeast
and
something
that
can
only
be
described
as
slight
fruitiness
the
mouthfeel
is
that
of
some
carbonation
and
a
nice
warmth
the
alcohol
is
well
masked
it
seems
slightly
sticky
like
sugar
the
taste
follows
the
smell
with
a
sweetness
and
slight
fruit
taste
i
really
enjoyed
this
beer
and
would
be
very
happy
drinking
it
everyday
d
off
the
charts
this
is
as
good
as
the
best
beer
i
have
ever
had
this
really
defied
my
expectations
what
i
anticipated
was
a
big
bold
flavor
profile
this
is
all
about
finesse
so
complex
but
not
a
slap
in
the
face
there
are
a
lot
of
subtle
notes
movements
none
of
them
overpower
the
others
wellbalanced
silky
smooth
flavorful
this
is
a
great
beer
so
easy
to
drink
quite
subtle
but
greatly
complex
from
notes
taken
on
62810
regardless
this
thing
was
absolutely
delicious
i
could
drink
this
all
day
d
i
can
see
what
the
hype
is
about
westy
12
is
near
perfect
extremely
easy
to
drink
this
may
be
the
best
beer
of
any
style
that
i
have
ever
had
the
opportunity
to
try
its
crazy
how
well
this
beer
drinks
i
am
honored
to
have
tried
it
and
have
to
say
it
is
every
bit
as
good
as
anyone
has
ever
said
amazing
amazing
amazing
there
will
soon
come
a
time
where
i
will
need
to
have
this
again
i
had
to
stop
for
a
bit
to
think
about
how
exactly
to
rate
this
ones
drinkability
i
had
no
desire
at
any
point
to
take
more
then
a
sip
i
have
been
repeatedly
pouring
this
into
a
4oz
sample
snifter
actually
nothing
more
is
needed
a
beer
that
can
make
12oz
fulfill
such
an
amount
of
time
and
be
so
complex
yet
still
be
easy
to
drink
perfect
bella
my
mother
hated
the
sip
of
this
i
let
her
have
dthis
is
unquestionably
the
best
beer
ive
ever
had
life
throws
so
many
overhyped
things
that
never
fit
the
bill
this
fits
the
bill
and
then
some
if
i
have
the
honor
of
drinking
this
again
i
will
d
really
great
for
a
quad
at
10
abv
i
could
drink
this
all
night
this
is
a
very
drinkable
brew
and
im
going
to
be
heading
to
my
fridge
for
an
encore
well
to
my
surprise
everything
made
this
rare
beer
exceptional
this
beer
was
a
great
beer
taste
color
and
quality
made
me
an
advocate
of
this
trappist
experience
a
must
try
for
anyone
the
flavors
keep
coming
back
in
interesting
ways
and
i
do
not
grow
to
despise
them
i
welcome
them
like
an
oil
lantern
after
my
flashlight
lost
power
d
delicious
and
everything
that
is
expected
of
a
beer
of
this
caliber
abv
is
high
so
its
not
a
perfect
5
this
is
as
close
to
a
perfect
beer
as
you
can
get
big
thanks
to
billinlafayette
for
this

on
the
cap
served
from
bottle
into
a
chimay
goblet
pours
a
deep
dark
brown
with
an
offwhite
two
finger
head
with
a
dusting
of
brown
sediment
on
the
top
maintains
phenomenal
lacing
throughout
the
aroma
is
comprised
of
fruit
bread
alcohol
and
malt
the
flavor
is
of
malt
bananas
alcohol
biscuits
citrus
and
bread
it
is
medium
on
the
palate
with
high
carbonation
overall
this
brew
is
excellent
in
all
aspects
the
complexity
of
this
one
is
truly
insane
the
appearance
is
awesome
as
well
this
one
sample
makes
me
want
to
book
a
flight
to
belgium
and
drink
more
the
hype
is
true
pours
a
murky
dark
walnut
in
color
with
very
little
light
coming
through
the
head
is
thick
and
bright
white
leaving
some
awesome
lacing
the
smell
is
a
bit
subtle
for
what
i
was
expecting
but
the
amount
of
scents
fuzed
into
a
singe
whiff
is
astounding
dried
fruits
cinnamon
yeast
spices
and
a
bunch
of
other
things
i
cant
even
put
my
finger
on
the
taste
is
more
complex
then
the
smell
but
also
subtle
raisins
the
slightest
citrus
note
cloves
and
a
warm
tasty
booze
dominates
for
me
the
mouthfeel
is
not
heavy
at
all
but
you
know
its
there
and
the
drinkability
is
through
the
roof
not
that
anyone
would
want
to
but
you
could
put
a
few
of
these
down
in
a
hurry
if
you
had
to
this
is
hands
down
the
best
quad
i
have
ever
had
i
dont
know
if
it
would
be
the
all
time
best
for
my
taste
but
i
would
never
argue
this
being
the
holy
grail
this
beer
is
worth
the
hype
and
is
a
must
have
on
any
beer
lovers
bucket
list
of
fine
beers
thank
you
monks
you
hath
done
well
id
drink
this
every
day
i
liked
the
10
a
bit
better
but
my
friends
who
i
shared
these
with
all
liked
this
better
but
were
talking
1
sub
a
and
1
sub
b
here
amazing
for
the
style
i
had
this
young
with
a
2013
best
by
date
12oz
bottle
poured
into
a
chalice
poured
a
ruddyred
tinged
dark
brown
a
moderately
aggressive
pour
yielded
a
huge
threefinger
white
head
it
settled
to
12
which
lasted
throughout
i
sipped
this
beer
and
there
was
that
fluffy
head
at
the
very
last
sip
the
nose
was
coffee
caramel
plums
lemon
clove
and
chocolate
the
taste
my
goodness
dark
sweet
fruit
plums
grapes
with
some
chocolate
at
the
start
and
some
spices
belgian
bready
yeasts
were
evident
the
finish
moved
to
dry
and
even
a
little
bitter
providing
a
wonderful
complex
and
balanced
evolution
mouthfeel
was
thick
without
being
syrupy
carbonation
was
surprisingly
high
but
seemed
to
fit
its
hard
not
to
gush
but
this
is
just
an
amazing
beer
i
wanted
to
find
fault
with
it
but
could
not
nothing
in
this
review
does
it
justice
because
it
is
the
subtleties
that
make
it
special
and
most
of
them
defy
description
it
is
not
overrated
you
must
have
this
dim
an
atheist
but
this
was
a
religious
experience
is
it
the
best
beer
on
earth
maybe
is
it
the
best
quad
on
earth
i
certainly
think
so
once
you
climb
everest
whats
next
pours
a
little
murky
medium
brown
with
a
lot
of
carb
offwhite
head
smells
are
dark
fruits
a
lot
of
yeast
slight
funk
and
a
hint
of
booze
smells
really
great
taste
some
dark
fruits
figs
a
lot
of
yeast
slight
funk
again
a
touch
of
hops
and
grapeskin
mouthfeel
is
perfect
amount
of
carb
smooth
feels
great
drinkability
is
very
good
i
understand
why
everyone
wants
to
try
this
beer
is
this
the
greatest
beer
ive
ever
had
no
but
it
is
definitely
a
great
one
and
one
i
would
love
to
drink
again
soon
very
soon
conclusion
was
it
the
earthshattering
worldviewchanging
epiphany
i
was
awaiting
no
but
i
dont
think
a
beer
thats
this
hyped
could
ever
meet
expectations
that
being
said
it
was
by
far
the
best
belgian
strong
dark
alequadrupel
ive
ever
had
i
think
if
the
bitterness
had
been
just
slightly
less
this
would
have
been
an
a
better
than
chimays
blue
and
rocheforts
10
wout
question
though
those
are
both
delicious
beers
i
havent
tried
achels
extra
yet
so
i
cant
comment
on
it
i
would
love
someday
to
have
34
of
these
so
i
could
drink
1
a
year
or
so
and
see
how
they
change
i
broke
this
open
to
celebrate
passing
my
ma
defense
that
day
again
thanks
to
frissianwits
i
cannot
think
of
a
better
way
to
have
celebrated
cant
say
whether
or
not
its
the
best
beer
ive
ever
tried
but
it
certainly
ranks
in
the
top
few
im
really
glad
i
got
to
try
this
thanks
to
a
very
generous
ba
we
picked
up
three
cases
of
12
at
the
st
sixtus
abbey
the
head
stays
until
the
last
drop
even
if
it
is
an
hour
later
the
taste
is
very
complex
and
almost
indescribable
three
of
us
shared
one
that
i
brought
back
to
the
states
each
of
us
had
different
impressions
it
has
hints
of
spice
sweetness
caramel
and
very
rich
mouthfeel
even
my
wife
who
does
not
like
any
beers
other
than
lambics
and
flanders
red
really
liked
it
a
lot
i
guess
i
should
not
have
let
her
taste
it
less
for
me
this
was
a
real
treat
to
enjoy
and
review
this
unique
beer
there
is
so
much
mystique
behind
this
plain
brown
bottle
with
the
gold
cap
i
can
only
imagine
what
it
would
have
been
to
enjoy
all
three
styles
at
sintsixtus
abbey
i
appreciate
the
generosity
of
our
friends
wanting
to
share
this
awesome
beer
with
us
thanks
zombob
the
one
big
knock
i
have
against
this
beer
is
the
alcohol
presence
for
as
hyped
as
this
beer
is
i
found
it
to
be
boozier
than
i
was
expecting
contrary
to
what
many
others
have
commented
this
booziness
would
be
more
understandable
if
the
flavors
were
more
potent
but
then
again
it
seems
that
this
beer
is
meant
to
tantalize
the
taste
buds
rather
than
punish
them
i
can
only
imagine
that
if
i
had
been
more
patient
and
given
the
alcohol
heat
some
more
time
in
the
cellar
to
calm
allowing
the
subtlety
of
the
flavors
to
truly
shine
i
would
have
seen
this
beer
as
the
worldclass
stuff
it
is
known
to
be
as
it
stands
however
it
is
still
a
unique
complex
enjoyable
beer
that
suffers
a
bit
from
its
potency
i
recently
took
a
trip
to
sint
sixtus
abbey
and
had
a
few
of
the
wesvleteren
12
at
the
cafe
served
in
one
of
the
nicest
beer
glasses
of
the
trappist
beers
the
dark
brown
beer
looks
almost
like
coke
an
average
amount
of
head
colored
light
brown
sat
on
top
of
the
beer
but
dwindled
after
a
few
sips
i
do
not
know
how
long
the
beer
at
the
cafe
has
been
aged
or
if
at
all
it
has
a
most
enjoyable
complex
taste
fruity
and
sweeter
initially
fading
to
lightly
sweet
deep
caramel
malt
flavor
bordering
on
a
malt
liquor
type
taste
very
smooth
and
finishing
with
a
crispness
that
leaves
the
mouth
just
slightly
dry
dry
truly
excellent
beer
d
perfectly
balanced
flavors
perfect
taste
a
little
heavy
for
top
drinkability
marks
but
it
is
not
a
weak
point
of
this
beer
i
agree
with
other
reviewers
that
the
alcohol
is
wellmasked
and
i
think
that
is
the
reason
why
this
is
the
highest
rated
beer
on
the
site
while
i
have
occasionally
struggled
to
get
through
a
whole
bottle
of
the
similarly
structured
rochefort
10
the
westvleteren
12
is
a
kinder
gentler
quadrupel
that
i
could
see
myself
drinking
all
day
long
glad
i
got
to
try
this
one
being
the
top
dog
and
all
but
it
is
definitely
not
my
1
very
good
though
and
would
not
pass
it
up
if
i
saw
it
but
i
can
easily
get
abt
12
and
rochfort
10
and
think
they
are
on
par
with
this
guy
my
favorite
of
the
4
d
this
beer
is
an
amazing
drinker
although
i
dont
see
the
hype
with
the
all
5s
i
do
feel
the
drinkability
should
be
a
5
the
alcohol
is
very
well
hidden
and
the
beer
overall
is
very
smooth
i
would
recommend
this
beer
to
everyone
who
hasnt
tried
it
d
hard
to
believe
its
over
10
rochefort
has
a
much
stronger
alcohol
taste
this
is
quite
drinkable
and
sweet
while
it
may
not
be
my
favorite
beer
i
can
understand
why
it
would
be
the
concensus
1
beer
over
all
a
lot
of
universal
appeal
and
the
mystique
of
the
westverleten
monks
helps
im
sure
however
is
it
blasphemous
to
say
i
like
rochefort
10
better
drinkability
tastes
and
smells
nice
but
the
lack
of
carbonation
ruined
it
for
me
i
hope
i
got
a
bad
bottle
otherwise
i
cant
understand
how
this
is
ranked
so
high
notes
best
before
240313
wonderful
beer
that
lived
up
to
the
hype
for
me
well
balanced
and
complex
really
an
enjoyable
beer
that
i
would
gladly
drink
again
a
touch
lighter
than
what
i
was
expecting
but
it
worked
well
very
tasty
beer
with
all
the
hype
i
can
see
how
it
might
fall
short
for
a
number
of
people
but
all
in
all
i
think
most
people
would
gladly
drink
another
absolutely
delicious
d
oh
no
it
is
almost
gone
this
is
the
worst
part
by
far
so
good
and
so
drinkable
i
wish
these
monks
were
closer
d
i
could
drink
this
beer
until
i
was
blue
in
the
face
my
oh
my
this
is
not
my
favorite
beer
ever
but
probably
the
best
beer
i
have
ever
had
lived
up
to
the
hype
for
sure
d
impeccable
fanfingtastic
no
alcohol
detected
in
the
finish
but
a
very
distant
warmth
returns
5
0
a
beer
that
lives
up
to
the
hype
the
only
drwaback
was
drinking
it
so
young
i
would
imagine
that
having
this
with
618
more
months
of
age
on
it
would
make
it
heavenly
as
it
is
the
heat
of
the
alcohol
is
the
only
flaw
overall
always
happy
to
try
westy
12
now
i
know
to
age
it
a
little
overall
with
an
unrivaled
coherence
great
mouthfeel
and
a
taste
unlike
any
other
belgian
ales
ive
tried
and
ive
tried
quite
a
few
westvleteren
12
is
in
a
class
all
its
own
and
is
one
of
my
favorite
beers
in
fact
the
8
may
be
the
only
other
beer
that
really
comes
close
d
again
the
alcohol
content
isnt
shy
about
showing
itself
and
the
punchiness
is
considerable
but
still
this
beer
is
utterly
fantastic
and
one
i
will
return
to
again
and
again
as
long
as
i
have
the
money
and
opportunity
worth
the
trip
to
belgium
d
i
can
definitely
see
how
this
has
received
such
high
reviews
but
does
it
deserve
the
no
1
spot
i
am
not
sure
what
i
am
sure
of
though
is
that
this
is
a
perfect
example
of
the
style
and
yet
adds
another
level
of
richness
into
the
mix
an
absolute
joy
to
drink
it
only
got
better
and
better
after
each
sip
no
matter
what
position
this
is
in
its
just
plainly
one
of
the
finest
belgains
i
have
had
the
pleasure
of
consuming
i
was
hoping
that
i
would
prefer
the
st
bernardus
or
the
rochefort
10
i
was
hoping
this
beer
was
all
about
the
hype
my
hopes
were
dashed
if
this
beer
was
as
available
as
the
other
two
mentioned
it
would
still
be
number
one
it
deserves
its
reputation
and
rating
all
in
all
this
one
was
definitely
not
as
good
as
expected
very
good
but
not
amazing
id
say
top
10
for
me
but
not
1
you
definitely
gotta
try
this
one
at
least
once
if
youre
beer
geek
i
am
extremely
excited
to
finally
get
an
opportunity
to
try
this
beer
after
hearing
so
much
about
it
pours
a
beautiful
dark
brown
color
with
a
nice
fairly
quickly
dissipating
beigecolored
head
aromas
of
candied
fruits
dark
brown
sugar
caramel
belgian
yeast
and
sherry
flavors
of
freshly
baked
brown
bread
stewed
plums
toffee
and
port
wine
an
exceptionally
complex
beer
and
one
that
definitely
lives
up
to
its
reputation
is
it
the
best
beer
in
the
world
no
but
its
certainly
in
the
conversation
outstandingly
drinkable
for
a
10
2er
i
could
drink
it
all
day
and
all
night
and
never
tire
i
might
get
very
drunk
but
i
would
never
ever
get
tired
of
this
master
piece
of
a
brew
drinkability
isnt
even
worth
discussing
i
could
drink
this
beer
every
day
and
never
tire
of
it
while
high
in
the
abv
department
youd
never
know
by
the
taste
stil
a
masterpiece
i
have
about
6
bottles
of
the
gold
still
remaining
another
one
wont
come
out
until
xmas
eve
but
i
am
looking
forward
to
a
couple
of
blondes
who
isnt
this
summer
this
is
indeed
the
best
beer
i
ever
had
and
i
had
many
quads
triples
doubles
stouts
ales
lambics
witbiers
gotta
go
now
hit
the
phone
see
if
i
can
order
a
crate
of
westys
the
monks
dont
think
about
us
while
making
the
beer
nor
do
we
think
about
them
while
having
it
but
we
miss
them
when
we
think
about
the
westvleteren
worth
the
trouble
and
hype
worth
review
no
100
finally
got
it
for
a
college
friends
graduation
from
law
school
pours
a
deep
amber
brown
with
a
generous
caramel
colored
head
has
an
aroma
of
dark
fruit
caramel
and
malts
some
breadiness
the
taste
was
worth
the
wait
this
beer
is
not
overrated
sweet
up
front
then
dark
fruit
taste
chocolate
notes
show
up
the
carbonation
hits
at
the
perfect
spot
nice
dry
clean
bitter
finish
with
a
subtle
tart
aftertaste
this
beer
was
absolutely
incredible
ive
been
drinking
st
bernardus
12
and
rochefort
10
to
prepare
myself
to
try
it
then
this
puppy
blew
them
out
of
the
water
unbelievable
the
difference
more
fruity
taste
and
a
delicious
warmth
not
as
boozy
as
other
quads
i
tried
and
i
can
easily
say
if
this
ever
comes
across
my
path
again
i
wont
be
trading
it
away
taste
followed
the
smell
got
plenty
of
raisiny
fruit
and
a
yeasty
sweetness
definitely
no
misgivings
about
it
being
a
belgian
quad
the
combination
of
creamy
casklike
texture
and
the
powerful
sweetness
is
not
my
preference
but
im
enjoying
this
beer
belgians
are
not
my
favorite
beers
this
was
my
4th
quad
seems
appropriate
and
i
found
this
to
be
the
most
interesting
one
ive
had
also
less
drinkable
than
others
due
to
the
sweetness
and
thickness
overall
its
good
but
definitely
not
as
good
as
the
8
being
as
how
i
lucked
upon
this
and
might
never
get
another
i
think
the
st
bernardus
abt
12
will
do
just
fine
as
its
equal
split
a
2005
vintage
with
brad
rain
water
earth
malt
yeast
sublime
hard
to
find
any
fault
with
this
best
beer
ever
what
does
that
even
mean
anyways
it
certainly
was
great
and
definitely
one
of
the
best
belgian
beers
i
have
had
yet
md
medium
bodied
brew
so
ever
so
smooth
a
brew
that
lived
up
to
its
name
for
sure
a
must
try
for
anyone
who
can
get
their
hands
on
one
i
hope
to
have
a
chance
to
have
another
someday
but
if
not
i
am
for
sure
glad
at
least
one
lucky
enough
to
try
this
from
a
friend
who
picked
it
up
from
the
abbey
in
belgium
in
2008
poured
deep
red
with
thick
white
head
great
lace
and
retention
something
very
appealing
about
it
smell
was
intense
sweet
cherries
raisins
caramel
and
malt
alcohol
in
the
nose
too
taste
was
equally
intense
incredibly
smooth
and
complex
sweet
and
bitter
fruit
and
bready
malt
followed
by
spice
and
alcohol
warming
yeasty
with
some
more
spice
and
alcohol
bite
in
the
finish
incredible
balance
and
complexity
i
cannot
even
begin
to
describe
the
end
of
the
westvleteren
it
sits
there
waiting
notes
did
a
mini
tasting
with
rochefort
10
and
st
bernardus
12
and
the
westy
just
to
see
which
was
the
best
hoping
it
wasnt
the
westy
so
i
wouldnt
have
to
seek
out
another
bottle
and
the
westy
won
hands
down
for
sure
the
best
tasting
quad
ive
had
without
a
doubt
a
very
skillfully
crafted
beer
and
completely
different
from
what
i
was
expecting
d
i
was
very
afraid
that
this
beer
will
be
overrated
and
nothing
exceptional
but
i
was
wrong
i
must
agree
it
is
really
exceptional
the
high
price
and
unavailability
makes
me
kind
of
sad
but
makes
me
also
think
about
becoming
a
monk
myself
on
the
other
hand
must
try
needless
to
say
being
the
1
rated
beer
on
ba
i
had
extremely
high
hopes
for
this
one
it
didnt
necessarily
disappoint
but
was
perhaps
less
stellar
than
i
expected
especially
after
having
tried
8
a
few
months
ago
which
i
found
to
have
an
unbelievable
crisp
butteriness
to
both
the
taste
and
mouthfeel
a
i
prepped
myself
for
this
and
had
time
to
myself
at
home
chilling
by
my
open
window
as
the
spring
breeze
blew
by
i
took
my
bottle
and
opened
it
up
gently
as
i
gently
poured
out
this
brew
i
noticed
the
gracefulness
of
its
body
as
it
filled
my
glass
golden
color
with
a
hint
of
reddish
rust
color
as
i
finished
pouring
it
in
i
also
see
that
the
head
is
little
but
awake
so
at
this
point
i
usually
let
it
get
10
minutes
of
warming
up
at
room
temp
but
i
cheated
and
took
a
drink
right
away
how
refreshing
can
a
beer
get
you
ask
lets
just
say
that
i
could
drink
this
year
round
everyday
the
aroma
was
mild
but
every
sense
of
flowery
parfume
and
almost
like
a
cologne
of
a
sense
taste
of
the
hops
and
the
yeast
are
well
balanced
clean
and
smooth
to
the
palate
it
could
be
drank
day
in
and
say
out
because
of
the
balance
nothing
is
dominant
here
just
great
craftsmanship
o
for
the
highest
rated
beer
on
ba
i
was
very
disappointed
it
is
a
good
quad
but
when
i
can
go
to
the
cornerstore
and
buy
a
rochefort
10
or
a
st
bernardus
abt
12
both
of
which
i
think
are
better
than
this
for
much
much
cheaper
it
makes
this
obsolete
very
glad
to
have
tried
this
but
this
is
a
one
and
done
given
the
logistics
of
obtaining
more
d
my
300th
review
on
my
birthday
and
the
1
rated
beer
in
the
world
awesome
i
would
definitely
love
to
get
this
baby
again
but
the
cost
is
considerable
for
what
the
real
price
is
vs
what
i
actually
paid
for
it
this
beer
is
unbelievable
rich
beautiful
and
complex
i
know
why
you
are
on
the
top
i
loved
westvleteren
8
but
i
was
unimpressed
with
the
12
this
beer
had
no
real
qualities
that
distinguished
it
from
its
counterparts
in
fact
many
of
its
characteristics
seemed
rather
ordinary
i
definitely
planning
on
sampling
another
bottle
in
the
near
future
to
see
if
my
opinion
should
change
taken
on
its
own
or
consumed
as
a
dessert
this
is
simply
heavenly
i
can
certainly
taste
the
similarities
to
other
more
easily
obtainable
beers
of
the
style
but
westvleteren
12
somehow
stands
apart
whether
its
because
its
truly
that
outstanding
or
because
the
hype
machine
has
a
grip
on
my
soul
remains
to
be
seen
regardless
this
is
definitely
a
beer
everyone
should
try
while
not
my
favorite
style
of
beer
its
easy
to
see
why
it
is
on
top
of
the
best
of
ba
its
a
very
enjoyable
beer
and
one
that
certainly
lives
up
to
its
reputation
i
was
not
disappointed
at
all
by
this
beer
and
will
drink
it
again
some
day
d
the
drinkability
is
great
having
never
tried
this
brew
before
i
was
expecting
a
big
sweet
mess
i
was
so
wrong
this
beer
is
smooth
crisp
and
delicious
it
just
makes
me
wish
i
could
enjoy
it
more
often
well
this
was
right
out
of
the
box
into
my
glass
mailroom
temperature
both
jeff
and
i
noted
a
distinct
apple
cider
aroma
it
was
uncanny
really
just
dark
unfiltered
unpasteurized
spiced
apple
cider
along
for
the
ride
some
pumpernickel
bread
caramelized
brown
sugar
barely
a
hint
of
oxidation
but
it
is
very
well
integrated
raisins
pears
and
some
brandy
one
of
the
things
that
is
so
impressive
about
this
beer
is
that
its
10
2
its
not
light
tasting
but
still
just
feels
so
pleasant
on
the
palate
its
not
as
dark
as
previous
times
that
i
have
had
it
or
as
i
remember
a
little
less
of
a
dark
fruit
presence
than
some
other
bottles
i
have
been
a
part
of
lowmedium
but
wellexecuted
carbonation
perfectly
accentuates
the
delicate
and
more
subtle
flavors
of
this
beer
its
just
a
masterfully
concocted
beverage
and
one
that
i
hope
to
be
able
to
enjoy
for
years
to
come
this
review
is
for
the
2005
bottle
but
numerically
reflects
what
this
beer
is
fresh
and
what
it
can
be
with
a
little
time
on
it
the
mouthfeel
is
the
most
impressive
part
of
this
beer
its
smooth
and
rich
yet
surprisingly
light
on
the
palate
the
carbonation
is
a
little
lower
than
im
used
to
but
is
still
adequate
the
drinkability
also
shocked
me
compared
to
others
in
the
style
there
is
no
comparison
other
quads
are
slow
sippers
and
hard
to
finish
but
this
one
begged
me
to
drink
more
than
half
a
bottle
i
dont
think
ive
had
a
beer
this
big
and
flavor
that
was
so
easy
drinking
i
wish
i
had
several
cases
of
this
i
swear
it
would
turn
peoples
notion
about
beer
truly
exceptional
to
be
brewed
only
by
the
divine
i
cant
wait
to
open
up
the
other
bottles
further
down
the
road
drinkability
easily
is
the
best
quad
ive
ever
had
i
could
have
easily
had
more
than
one
of
these
unfortunately
i
only
have
one
bottle
left
and
im
going
to
save
that
for
a
spell
if
it
was
more
readily
available
i
would
drink
this
every
day
as
far
as
im
concerned
it
lives
up
to
the
hype
it
is
world
class
as
stated
on
its
page
and
i
cannot
say
that
i
would
argue
against
billing
it
best
beer
in
the
world
md
smooth
and
perfect
lives
up
to
the
hype
d
this
is
the
most
sessionable
high
alcohol
beer
ive
ever
had
the
legendary
westy
12
absolutely
lived
up
to
the
hype
such
a
special
beer
truly
a
work
of
art
i
could
drink
this
every
day
palpable
aromas
of
strongly
fortified
portlike
wine
intense
sugary
sweetness
plums
dried
fruits
represented
by
prunes
sour
cherries
figs
and
rum
soaked
raisins
clear
presence
of
alcohol
which
is
well
incorporated
into
the
whole
each
aroma
listed
reincarnates
itself
in
the
flavor
department
that
perfectly
matches
the
nose
the
mouthfeel
of
warming
and
liqueurish
brew
is
syrupy
but
not
in
a
sickly
manner
with
zero
carbonation
im
pouring
the
beer
carefully
to
keep
the
black
slush
at
the
bottom
even
so
the
last
pour
is
hazy
due
to
the
raised
yeasty
sediment
which
adds
some
spiciness
and
in
contrary
with
beliefs
does
not
ruin
the
beer
fully
mature
westvleteren
12
is
great
although
does
not
have
much
in
common
with
what
i
see
as
a
beer
2
5

i
would
like
to
say
more
about
this
beer
and
feel
as
though
it
just
deserves
more
but
i
just
really
dont
even
know
what
to
say
i
dont
really
need
to
say
much
more
this
stuff
is
amazing
worth
every
dime
i
think
anyone
who
enjoys
beer
should
give
this
a
try
at
least
once
as
it
is
a
little
pricey
but
damn
it
is
well
worth
it
best
quad
ive
ever
had
yes
i
would
definitely
say
so
ive
never
tasted
anything
so
complex
best
beer
in
the
world
thats
a
bit
more
debatable
but
it
very
well
could
be
worth
the
trouble
to
obtain
better
than
the
hype
best
quad
ever
yes
best
beer
ever
id
have
a
hard
time
arguing
with
you
drinkability
surprisingly
drinkable
and
smooth
finally
got
to
try
this
thanks
to
dj
breezy
the
most
notable
things
for
me
were
the
sugary
sour
apply
jolly
rancher
part
of
the
nose
and
flavor
profile
the
complexity
that
gave
new
flavors
with
each
sip
dark
fruits
apple
pear
and
a
level
of
smoothness
that
is
unmatched
exceptionally
complex
and
smooth
unique
smell
unique
flavor
earthy
notestaste
of
grape
tannin
but
without
winy
flavor
alcohol
subtily
hidden
and
very
nice
body
well
balanced
it
is
like
drinking
honey
so
unctuous
so
rustic
maybe
not
the
world
best
beer
but
still
a
wonderful
one
fabulous
drinkability
yeah
if
i
could
buy
this
locally
i
would
never
drink
any
other
beer
as
long
as
i
live
well
worth
the
effort
locating
some
bottles
would
do
it
again
and
again
drinkability
if
you
ignore
the
extreme
difficulty
in
getting
this
beer
is
fantastic
the
alcohol
sneaks
into
your
head
eventually
but
otherwise
i
could
drink
this
all
day
worth
saving
and
my
only
regret
is
that
i
only
had
1
bottle
a
worldclass
brew
this
is
my
favorite
style
and
i
think
it
stands
shoulder
to
shoulder
with
rochefort
10
as
the
best
quad
brewed
today
big
thanks
to
jason
for
this
one
pours
brown
with
a
little
slightly
offwhite
head
nothing
too
special
to
look
at
flavor
and
aroma
are
lots
of
dark
fruits
with
brown
sugar
and
a
lot
of
sweetness
obviously
this
beer
is
wellregarded
as
it
should
be
but
to
me
its
just
not
the
best
beer
ive
had
glad
to
have
tried
it
though
and
truly
a
unique
experience
if
i
could
get
this
regularly
for
a
reasonable
price
i
surely
would
d
the
drinkability
is
really
good
this
beer
is
just
super
complex
and
full
bodied
i
could
drink
this
for
days
pours
a
dark
ruby
with
a
rocky
head
aromas
of
candied
sugar
and
cloves
with
some
raisins
dates
grapes
and
currants
the
burnt
banana
peel
often
attributed
to
it
is
apt
taste
is
more
caramelized
sweetness
dark
fruit
and
a
deep
rounded
clove
finish
this
beer
gets
more
flavor
and
complexity
out
of
the
yeast
than
probably
any
other
in
the
world
lambics
excepted
a
velvety
body
adds
wonderfully
to
the
experience
worth
the
hype
and
a
true
delight
taste
is
extraordinary
and
probably
has
the
best
mouthfeel
of
any
beer
ive
ever
had
it
is
scary
how
easy
this
one
is
to
drink
at
10
2
abv
it
hides
it
very
well
i
have
tried
this
beer
on
3
different
occasions
and
it
remains
to
be
one
of
my
favorites
great
texture
tingly
and
soft
at
the
same
time
absolutely
no
hint
of
the
abv
such
an
easy
drinking
quad
too
clearly
the
best
d
so
is
it
the
best
beer
in
the
world
probably
not
but
its
a
superb
one
nonetheless
its
shockingly
drinkable
for
a
10
2
quad
and
i
could
actually
have
more
than
one
of
these
without
feeling
diabetic
too
theres
been
a
lot
written
about
this
beer
and
im
not
sure
theres
much
i
can
add
its
excellent
highly
recommended
and
worthy
of
the
acclaim
that
has
been
heaped
upon
it
the
flavors
in
this
beer
are
extremely
complex
yet
unified
i
dont
know
if
this
is
really
the
best
beer
in
the
world
but
it
is
certainly
one
of
the
greats
thanks
to
brabander
who
sent
some
bottles
of
this
and
thanks
to
my
roommate
wahmaster
for
allowing
me
to
have
one
i
have
had
better
beers
that
night
even
d
i
have
never
been
happier
knowing
that
my
father
in
law
travels
to
belgium
on
a
regular
basis
i
want
to
drink
this
everyday
i
will
def
revisit
this
masterpiece
as
often
as
i
can
lucky
enough
to
get
a
hold
of
one
of
these
from
a
very
generous
trader
would
this
live
up
to
the
hype
the
answer
is
yes
this
is
the
best
belgian
beer
i
have
had
hands
down
this
handles
all
the
complex
quad
flavors
so
well
its
ridiculous
it
is
actually
hard
to
pick
out
individual
flavors
i
found
myself
saying
wow
at
just
about
every
sip
this
is
a
complex
rich
fruity
malty
awesome
beer
the
mouthfeel
is
so
smooth
and
goes
down
so
easy
if
i
could
get
this
everyday
i
could
easily
put
down
a
few
at
once
i
kind
of
feel
like
im
fueling
the
hype
train
but
it
deserves
it
drank
this
after
a
roch
10
and
before
a
bernardus
12
and
it
was
head
and
shoulders
above
those
two
westvleteren
12
is
a
quadruple
style
belgian
ale
pouring
a
beautiful
rich
dark
caramel
color
with
a
thick
frothy
head
its
armoa
is
a
mix
between
a
bakery
and
a
ripe
orchard
it
tastes
of
fresh
baked
wheat
bread
honey
coated
cinnamon
sweet
cloves
sticky
molasses
and
ripe
figs
at
10
20
abv
it
is
a
forced
to
be
reckoned
with
and
demands
patience
and
respect
d
i
could
drink
many
the
alcohol
is
well
hidden
a
true
delight
bottle
courtesy
of
harpreet
pours
mahogany
semicloudy
with
a
medium
tan
head
that
leaves
only
a
little
bit
behind
awesome
aroma
of
dark
fruits
plum
date
raisin
fig
caramel
malts
spices
and
faint
alcohol
the
flavor
lives
up
to
the
nose
with
the
same
dark
fruits
caramel
and
malts
as
well
as
mild
spices
nuts
wood
and
warming
alcohol
medium
bodied
really
smooth
and
alcohol
is
pretty
subdued
for
being
10
its
hard
to
find
flaws
in
this
one
maybe
the
body
is
thin
for
the
style
and
the
color
isnt
the
most
beautiful
shade
of
mahogany
but
those
are
just
tiny
observations
that
mean
virtually
nothing
compared
to
this
beer
as
a
whole
i
never
thought
this
could
live
up
to
the
hype
but
it
absolutely
satisfied
all
expectations
i
cant
wait
to
visit
the
place
someday
and
try
some
there
d
and
overall
impression
i
could
drink
this
all
night
it
really
doesnt
get
any
better
overall
this
is
one
of
the
best
brews
i
have
ever
had
simply
amazing
skal
probably
one
of
the
best
beers
in
the
world
regardless
of
the
hype
fantastic
and
very
unique
flavor
too
bad
i
dont
have
more
my
buddy
brought
out
one
aged
5
years
and
one
that
had
aged
10
years
and
you
could
simply
experience
the
difference
the
10
year
bottle
was
pure
perfection
as
you
experience
the
incredible
amount
of
flavor
and
the
yeasty
punch
after
the
first
sip
you
are
immediately
feel
this
balancing
sensation
on
the
back
of
your
tongue
quite
unexplainable
simply
delicious
d
smooth
and
delicious
lives
up
to
the
hype
for
me
imo
not
the
best
beer
in
the
world
but
damn
near
close
looking
forward
to
getting
my
own
bottle
very
soon
and
not
sharing
drinkability
a
truly
worldclass
brew
im
deeply
grateful
to
brabander
for
the
opportunity
to
try
this
one
if
you
can
get
your
hands
on
it
try
it
d
very
drinkable
beer
especially
for
a
quad
i
typically
find
quads
to
be
a
bit
rough
and
very
much
a
sipper
of
a
beer
not
this
one
flavors
are
strong
but
balanced
nothing
hot
about
this
from
an
alcohol
standpoint
very
drinkable
excellent
this
beer
is
very
drinkable
the
abv
actually
makes
it
a
bit
dangerous
but
yum
in
every
respect
again
much
thanks
for
the
beer
and
i
hope
many
people
continue
to
enjoy
ideas
from
fellow
taster
so
is
it
the
end
all
be
all
the
ratings
dont
lie
this
is
an
amazing
beverage
i
think
the
rarity
and
mystique
probably
add
to
the
experience
but
believe
the
hype
this
beer
deserves
the
acclaim
a
good
beer
like
a
good
wine
must
exist
in
time
this
is
to
say
it
must
be
good
at
the
moment
you
have
it
but
also
good
in
the
scheme
of
beers
as
a
whole
such
that
as
new
styles
and
techniques
evolve
it
remains
well
regarded
and
enjoyable
the
fact
that
this
one
has
acquired
a
nickname
westy
is
a
testament
to
this
out
of
a
bottle
provided
by
ba
members
thank
you
this
legend
was
a
deep
copper
color
with
burgundy
highlights
it
was
visibly
viscous
leaving
good
streaks
of
lacing
off
the
wellretained
head
the
aroma
was
complex
and
demanding
a
sensual
blend
of
ripe
plums
dates
and
dark
fruits
galore
behind
that
was
alcohol
esp
dark
rum
chocolate
spices
and
the
pungent
twist
of
belgian
yeast
the
flavors
were
just
as
big
and
layered
chocolate
more
dark
fruits
coffee
hints
raisins
wood
cinnamon
figs
etc
etc
the
doughy
notes
were
hard
to
discern
under
the
other
heavier
elements
but
the
impact
was
like
an
alcohol
soaked
fruitcake
despite
the
depth
of
the
beer
it
was
indeed
a
brew
with
finesse
and
a
good
finish
easy
to
drink
no
its
rich
and
intense
pleasant
to
drink
yes
especially
if
you
love
beer
a
casual
drinker
could
be
run
over
by
this
thing
the
mouthfeel
was
good
and
creamy
but
not
amazing
the
body
full
without
being
heavy
and
the
carbonation
right
on
relatively
drinkable
for
all
that
is
has
to
offer
and
a
genuine
joy
for
the
advanced
palate
in
short
this
delivered
on
every
level
including
living
up
to
its
reputation
and
if
you
can
find
it
do
so
edit
the
more
and
more
i
drink
this
the
more
i
realize
how
ridiculous
the
mouthfeel
is
truly
a
thing
of
beauty
d
its
definitely
a
sit
down
and
talk
beer
but
i
could
definitely
drink
several
its
one
of
those
that
are
so
good
you
just
want
to
sip
on
to
make
it
last
taste
perfection
you
can
hardly
taste
the
alcohol
behind
the
rush
of
flavors
fruits
raisins
figs
slight
gingerbread
taste
sweet
caramel
but
not
overpoweringly
sweet
just
enough
god
i
love
christmas
rated
side
by
side
blind
with
dieu
du
ciel
rigor
mortis
and
st

abt
12
very
spicy
nutty
aroma
with
some
fruitiness
very
rich
nutty
taste
lots
of
booze
and
tropical
fruits
full
creamy
a
mouthfeel
a
beautiful
beer
but
a
little
young
it
took
me
an
hour
to
properly
savour
this
brew
as
the
complexity
is
nearly
unparalleled
like
most
bas
i
prefer
a
handful
of
beers
over
westy
12
but
its
still
a
beast
that
needs
to
be
tamed
at
some
point
in
your
craft
beer
journey
i
feel
extremely
fortunate
to
have
tried
this
legendary
quad
a
tasty
and
luxurious
treat
deserving
of
its
world
class
status
not
sure
if
this
is
the
best
beer
in
the
world
but
there
are
certainly
no
flaws
thanks
again
to
thirdeye11
md
incredibly
smooth
and
complex
in
both
aroma
and
taste
this
beer
at
least
meets
the
hype
ill
leave
excedes
the
hype
to
the
individual
i
wouldnt
say
this
was
the
best
beer
i
have
ever
had
but
it
was
incredibly
good
and
worth
the
cost
to
try
at
least
once
forgive
spellinggrammar
from
my
iphone
poured
into
a
westvleteren
chalice
near
perfect
incredibly
well
balanced
with
many
complex
darkfruit
flavors
and
some
brown
sugar
and
toffee
flavors
it
is
sweetened
nicely
im
glad
i
have
two
alcohol
is
amazingly
well
hidden
as
well
making
for
an
all
too
easy
to
drink
beer
very
drinkable
2005
vintage
this
poured
a
hazy
mahogany
with
moderate
light
tan
head
it
smelled
like
strong
sweet
brown
sugar
and
caramel
and
creamy
yeast
with
some
banana
nut
bread
and
milk
chocolate
and
confectioners
sugar
and
raisin
it
tasted
like
toffee
and
brown
sugar
and
raisin
and
banana
nut
bread
with
creamy
yeast
and
cocoa
powder
and
chalky
confectioners
sugar
it
was
oily
with
smooth
carbonation
and
had
a
bittersweet
aftertaste
overall
this
was
amazingly
sweet
malty
and
complex
it
really
is
one
of
the
best
belgian
ales
ever
it
had
a
delicious
scent
and
taste
with
great
body
the
alcohol
was
well
hidden
so
it
was
easy
to
drink
but
it
definitely
needs
to
be
sipped
to
be
fully
savored
im
curious
how
this
tastes
fresh
but
i
dont
know
when
ill
ever
find
out
regardless
this
beer
meets
the
hype
fantastic
pours
a
dark
brownred
color
lots
of
carbonation
nice
small
creamy
head
which
leaves
pretty
quick
lots
of
nice
lacing
throughout
the
drink
in
forms
of
islands
in
some
spots
scents
are
very
complex
lots
of
stuff
going
on
but
could
detect
plums
raisins
toffee
the
taste
is
very
very
nice
i
believe
ive
had
nothing
like
this
so
far
nice
tarttangysweet
flavor
could
taste
plumsgrapes
i
think
the
finish
is
dry
and
clean
medium
body
well
rounded
with
a
carbonated
feel
very
drinkable
this
is
my
first
westy
and
what
a
powerfulexcellentawesome
brew
just
might
have
to
try
and
get
some
soon
d
yes
this
is
a
great
quad
to
say
the
least
but
is
it
the
best
beer
in
the
world
well
perhaps
not
in
my
humble
opinion
but
still
this
is
an
excellent
quad
i
try
not
to
buy
into
the
hype
but
i
honestly
think
it
somewhat
sways
my
senses
i
honestly
cant
be
sure
if
it
made
me
more
critical
or
more
flexible
but
what
i
am
sure
of
is
that
this
is
a
very
good
beer
its
not
my
favorite
and
not
as
good
as
rochefort
10
but
it
is
up
there
what
its
not
is
worth
the
hype
i
wouldnt
pass
up
another
one
but
i
would
not
actively
search
it
out
again
there
are
far
better
beers
that
are
readily
available
here
in
the
states
drinkability
is
also
unheardof
to
be
blessed
with
great
friends
great
beers
and
great
memories
is
what
life
is
about
this
is
a
beer
to
celebrate
the
best
of
all
life
has
to
offer
this
is
an
awesome
brew
lots
of
candi
sugar
and
not
heavy
on
the
annoying
clove
corriander
like
some
belgians
highly
and
dangerously
drinkable
a
true
find
worth
searching
out
for
those
who
have
yet
to
try
it
best
in
the
world
but
worth
seeking
for
sure
i
must
admit
though
this
is
a
must
try
cheers
overall
is
it
worth
it
i
would
have
to
say
sort
of
is
it
good
yes
i
really
like
this
quad
because
it
isnt
so
boozy
as
compared
to
a
lot
of
the
other
quads
i
have
had
it
is
worth
a
try
a
lot
of
nice
flavors
in
this
beer
a
bit
slow
drinking
however
an
excellent
exceptional
beer
it
may
not
be
the
best
beer
ive
ever
had
but
i
certainly
understand
why
so
many
believe
that
it
is
i
may
prefer
the
abt
12
but
this
is
about
as
good
as
it
gets
d
this
beer
is
pretty
rather
divine
and
i
am
almost
tempted
to
try
and
fetch
another
few
bottles
i
almost
did
not
want
to
like
this
beer
going
into
it
because
of
its
scarcity
and
it
always
seems
like
a
faux
pas
to
give
into
the
best
a
complex
aroma
and
a
smoothmellow
flavor
appropriating
this
to
the
age
of
the
beer
made
for
a
great
experience
incidentally
when
you
pour
this
make
sure
none
of
the
sediment
gets
through
once
id
finished
my
glass
i
went
back
and
poured
the
last
inch
or
so
through
a
paper
kitchen
towel
hoping
to
filter
out
the
sediment
and
get
another
few
sips
i
failed
and
ended
up
with
a
very
hazy
last
inch
it
didnt
taste
the
same
drinkable
but
the
complexity
was
gone
other
beers
st
austell
clouded
yellow
for
example
seem
quite
tolerant
to
this
but
not
the
westy
remember
store
upright
for
eight
days
and
leave
the
black
sludge
in
the
bottle
taste
is
very
crisp
and
sweet
and
its
got
some
complex
grainearthy
flavors
light
belgian
yeastiness
to
it
with
raisins
dominating
the
flavor
the
95
as
much
more
mellow
and
drinkablesmooth
but
the
09
was
very
bright
and
sharp
both
were
excellent
overall
this
is
a
great
quad
and
a
great
beer
in
general
overall
the
mouth
feel
is
carbonated
warming
and
smooth
the
body
of
the
beer
is
medium
and
the
finish
is
medium
to
medium
full
this
beer
is
fantastic
it
has
so
much
going
on
in
it
yet
it
is
so
simple
the
flavor
explode
in
your
mouth
and
is
very
easy
to
drink
the
head
was
disappointing
nonetheless
the
flavor
makes
up
for
it
i
am
so
glad
that
i
got
to
try
it
it
is
just
amazing
d
obviously
a
sipper
but
goes
down
really
well
so
complex
in
the
flavors
and
develops
nicely
as
it
warms
to
room
temperature
the
alcohol
is
noticable
in
the
spicey
flavor
it
gives
but
does
not
come
across
boozy
so
i
think
i
could
easily
do
two
of
these
a
pleasure
to
drink
and
i
really
would
like
to
have
this
again
and
would
love
to
cellar
a
few
as
well
to
see
what
age
will
do
overall
very
good
great
tart
taste
complex
great
sipper
not
the
best
quad
i
have
had
though
d
definitely
worth
the
hype
behind
it
i
dont
know
if
i
could
drink
this
everyday
but
it
is
worth
it
overall
not
quite
the
mind
blowing
experiance
i
had
envisioned
for
the
number
one
beer
a
good
beer
that
i
would
love
to
revisit
im
glad
i
was
able
to
share
this
with
a
friend
for
our
birthdays
another
huge
thanks
to
todd
for
sharing
this
with
me
for
our
shared
birthday
got
to
try
this
again
thanks
to
jeffo
very
solid
quad
it
tasted
a
little
hot
at
first
but
it
settled
and
became
very
drinkable
lots
of
brown
sugar
and
dark
fruits
in
the
flavour
drinkability
what
can
i
say
very
very
drinkable
probably
the
most
drinkable
ale
at
this
abv
that
i
have
had
it
compares
very
favorably
overall
to
other
belgians
that
ive
had
though
i
still
need
to
try
a
couple
of
the
classics
i
just
had
a
nice
maredsous
8
on
draft
at
the
renaissance
fair
here
in
texas
and
it
was
lovely
but
it
didnt
have
the
depth
of
character
that
this
westvleteren
exhibited
this
ale
is
a
classic
for
sure
i
dont
know
if
its
the
best
in
the
world
but
its
certainly
in
my
top
few
beers
ive
tried
drinkability
if
this
is
the
holy
grail
its
one
and
done
for
me
i
hope
that
i
have
been
duped
and
i
bought
one
of
those
counterfeit
beers
i
have
one
more
in
the
cellar
my
closet
will
edit
my
review
if
this
was
just
a
bad
bottle
one
of
those
few
beers
that
lives
up
to
its
hype
and
delivers
certainly
does
not
disappoint
i
now
know
the
exemplar
to
hold
all
other
quads
up
to
wow
once
again
thanks
to
goldorak
how
am
i
gonna
follow
this
one
up
i
wish
westy
12
came
in
a
750ml
so
tasty
and
easy
to
drink
its
gone
before
you
know
it
dont
pass
up
an
oppertunity
to
try
westvleteren
12
atleast
once
in
your
lifetime
drinkability
i
kept
pulling
it
back
and
was
saddened
when
it
was
gone
i
have
to
say
when
i
had
bernardus
12
on
tap
a
few
times
on
tap
i
really
loved
it
and
this
beer
was
everything
it
was
and
just
a
hint
more
i
dont
know
if
i
had
them
both
aged
to
the
same
point
what
they
would
look
like
in
comparison
but
both
are
worthy
and
amazing
beers
worth
its
post
in
the
pantheon
of
great
beers
this
is
for
certain
and
like
everyone
always
says
i
just
wish
i
could
grab
this
more
regularly
for
a
special
occasion
massively
complex
flavor
brown
sugar
fig
and
plum
sweetness
alcohol
is
well
hidden
but
catches
up
with
you
in
the
end
very
creamy
mouth
feel
this
beer
completely
coats
your
mouth
and
stays
sticky
throughout
notes
this
beer
grew
on
me
my
first
impression
wasnt
wow
but
this
beers
complexity
takes
time
to
appreciate
i
still
have
five
more
so
hopefully
a
little
age
will
lower
the
amount
of
heat
d
a
very
nice
beer
is
it
the
best
in
the
world
not
in
my
opinion
but
still
worth
seeking
out
a
great
beer
all
around
md
one
of
the
creamiest
smoothest
beers
i
have
had
i
think
the
mouthfeel
may
actually
be
my
favorite
part
of
this
beer
not
the
best
beer
on
planet
earth
in
my
opinion
but
absolutely
worth
tracking
down
deep
brown
color
strong
lacy
tan
head
malty
nutty
aroma
full
mouth
complex
malty
vinuous
nutty
flavor
with
hints
of
dates
raisins
and
dark
cherries
amazing
complexity
grows
with
each
year
of
storage
ive
tasted
brews
aged
up
to
8
years
with
amazing
results
also
tasted
in
a
westvleternflavoured
ice
cream
believe
it
or
not
at
the
monastery
tap
in
a
class
of
its
own
overall
a
very
tasty
quad
no
doubt
but
the
look
wasnt
all
that
spectacular
and
the
feel
definitely
held
it
back
some
a
little
too
thin
and
airy
a
thicker
more
robust
palate
would
bring
it
over
the
hump
and
set
it
apart
from
the
masses
for
sure
unlike
their
dubbel
which
is
worldclass
to
say
the
least
and
despite
the
superb
taste
profile
this
one
doesnt
quite
live
up
to
the
hype
in
the
quad
showdown
its
a
tossup
between
this
and
the
st
bernardus
while
both
are
well
behind
the
superior
rochefort
10
i
drank
all
three
of
my
bottles
on
my
trip
so
i
doubt
that
i
will
have
another
anytime
in
the
near
future
so
i
must
ask
the
question
is
this
the
best
beer
in
the
world
it
was
great
but
i
think
that
i
like
rochefort
10
a
little
better
d
for
its
strength
quite
good
the
alcohol
content
is
very
very
subtle
i
would
almost
prefer
that
it
be
a
bit
more
apparent
in
fact
the
aroma
is
lovely
but
i
wouldnt
mind
a
bit
more
warming
in
the
mouth
overall
1
in
the
world
in
my
opinion
no
but
i
can
definitely
see
why
this
beer
is
enjoyed
by
so
many
people
ive
had
the
pleasure
of
drinking
this
mighty
fine
brew
and
hope
one
day
i
can
enjoy
it
again
cheers
rich
full
of
taste
sweetnes
but
not
too
much
d
very
tasty
goes
down
quite
easily
not
too
filling
deceptively
strong
kick
very
good
representation
of
style
as
it
is
ranked
1
on
ba
at
the
time
of
this
review
and
has
been
for
some
time
i
was
expecting
something
a
bit
more
demonstrative
from
this
beer
but
the
only
things
that
stood
out
in
this
beer
above
other
were
its
sweetness
and
its
smoothness
while
i
dont
consider
it
the
absolute
best
beer
on
earth
it
is
indeed
very
good
now
the
question
is
when
do
i
drink
my
two
remaining
bottles
a
large
feat
this
beer
accomplishes
is
integrating
the
alcohol
so
well
into
the
fruit
that
it
resembles
wine
in
many
ways
is
this
why
this
beer
is
so
worldrenowned
because
it
so
tastes
like
wine
additionally
the
intense
sweetness
leaves
me
wondering
as
well
other
quadrupels
or
sweetened
lambics
leave
beer
geeks
complaining
over
the
sugar
content
but
still
they
are
not
as
sweet
as
this
beer
it
is
all
quite
perplexing
a
very
good
beer
this
is
yes
but
drinking
it
sheds
a
lot
of
light
on
the
biases
of
the
beer
world
this
beer
took
third
place
in
my
threeway
sidebyside
this
is
a
great
beer
worldclass
no
doubt
but
best
on
the
planet
i
think
thats
a
stretch
the
nose
is
amazing
as
good
as
any
i
have
smelled
to
this
point
however
the
pallete
is
a
bit
less
complex
than
suggested
by
the
nose
dont
get
me
wrong
this
beer
is
better
than
most
its
mindblowingly
good
i
jsut
find
the
alcohol
to
be
a
bit
much
and
the
flavor
profile
to
be
a
hair
off
all
in
all
a
truely
great
beer
though
it
takes
a
while
to
drink
this
beer
but
it
is
best
to
savor
it
each
taste
should
be
a
mouthful
that
you
spend
at
least
five
seconds
before
you
swallow
it
to
fully
experience
all
this
beer
has
to
offer
if
you
have
the
chance
to
try
it
i
fully
recommend
it
nevertheless
i
will
still
prefer
drinking
a
great
ipa
on
a
regular
basis
on
occasions
i
drink
belgiums
but
if
i
had
wests
12
all
the
time
i
may
possibly
drink
them
all
the
time
unfortunately
they
are
hard
to
find
i
have
two
left
one
for
when
i
get
married
and
the
other
when
i
become
a
father
decent
drinkability
but
i
would
find
it
infinitely
more
interesting
if
it
were
carbonated
i
have
one
more
bottle
in
my
fridge
and
i
really
hope
its
carbonated
if
it
is
and
it
tastes
a
helluva
lot
better
then
ill
repost
an
edit
on
my
review
d
this
is
the
kind
of
beer
that
i
would
imagine
a
st
bernard
would
carry
to
a
frozen
hiker
seriously
i
was
sweating
after
drinking
this
beer
but
in
all
seriousness
good
beer
everything
that
i
imagined
not
my
favorite
but
definitely
in
my
top
10
after
a
bit
of
hesitation
i
finally
pop
the
cap
pours
a
pure
brown
infused
with
a
panoply
of
bubbles
a
slight
covering
of
tan
head
dissipates
quickly
leaving
a
few
dots
of
lace
strewn
about
the
aroma
is
vinous
with
ripe
grapes
grape
juice
grain
beer
bread
and
some
candy
sweetness
underneath
it
all
as
it
warms
the
complexity
grows
with
notes
of
vinegar
and
phenols
eventually
opening
up
tastes
bready
malty
and
fruity
up
front
the
alcohol
heat
goes
straight
to
the
stomach
and
curls
up
into
a
warm
fuzzy
little
ball
subsequent
drinks
reveal
some
sweet
chocolates
and
caramel
as
well
as
spice
and
grain
the
medium
to
fullbody
goes
down
creamy
and
im
looking
at
the
halfempty
bottle
already
wishing
i
had
more
of
this
goodness
d
quite
complex
and
takes
a
while
to
drink
and
only
gets
better
as
it
warms
up
very
nice
to
savor
for
a
long
period
of
time
while
continuing
to
find
new
things
going
on
glad
i
got
to
try
such
a
fine
beer
sets
a
benchmark
of
what
a
quad
should
be
drink
em
if
you
got
em
mouth
is
overcarbonated
at
first
but
flattens
out
quickly
slightly
dry
like
it
has
been
wood
aged
but
im
sure
it
hasnt
i
cant
even
describe
this
one
past
a
point
i
could
enjoy
a
bottle
but
i
wouldnt
dare
waste
another
on
a
ruined
palate
dthis
is
an
amazing
beer
but
i
would
never
want
it
all
the
time
what
i
would
like
to
do
is
get
hold
of
a
few
of
them
or
even
be
lucky
enough
to
try
one
fresh
overall
this
is
absolutely
the
best
beer
in
the
world
fresh
good
vintage
simple
the
best
i
can
drink
this
one
whole
year
perfect
balance
between
sweet
bitterness
and
spices
it
is
so
soft
smooth
creanessmy
and
full
of
taste
this
must
be
the
real
angels
share
all
other
beers
in
the
world
eat
your
heart
out
the
only
complaint
i
could
have
is
that
the
nose
is
not
strong
enough
but
i
find
this
to
be
completely
irrelevant
when
considering
how
synergistic
the
whole
beer
is
together
keeping
this
brew
from
receiving
a
perfect
score
in
that
respect
would
not
be
right
this
is
the
beer
and
will
be
so
in
my
view
until
i
try
something
that
is
even
better
for
its
own
style
drinkable
absolutely
i
was
expecting
a
lot
and
it
delivered
drinkability
the
only
thing
impeding
the
drinkability
is
availability
more
please
bottle
dated
best
before

pours
a
deep
mahogany
ruby
highlights
and
a
long
lasting
huge
pillow
white
head
smells
of
rich
dark
fruit
candi
sugar
cereal
a
light
grassiness
yeasty
a
hint
of
alcohol
somewhat
vinous
amazingly
complex
flavor
profile
is
so
deep
im
not
even
sure
i
know
how
to
describe
it
getting
some
candied
figs
lightly
chocolaty
chewy
malts
buttery
on
the
finish
full
velvety
body
with
carbonation
just
dancing
in
your
mouth
this
definitely
lives
up
to
its
reputation
i
need
more
please
send
d
i
must
admit
i
had
pretty
lofty
expectations
for
this
brew
but
i
can
easily
say
that
this
is
one
of
the
best
beers
that
i
have
ever
had
by
far
one
of
the
most
complex
and
drinkable
beers
around
guess
im
one
of
those
people
that
likes
westy
8
more
as
my
score
isnt
as
high
for
the
12
pours
a
swampwater
brown
but
plenty
of
tan
head
salvages
the
appearance
smell
is
sweet
malty
dark
fruit
stone
fruit
grapes
yeast
and
bread
tastes
similar
but
add
brown
sugar
to
the
mix
i
dont
find
this
as
complex
and
layered
as
the
westy
8
maybe
that
means
my
palate
isnt
as
complex
but
it
is
what
it
is
body
is
medium
with
medium
to
high
carbonation
highly
drinkable
could
drink
3
no
problem
but
i
disagree
with
the
characterization
of
this
beer
as
best
in
the
world
its
great
but
easily
eclipsed
by
several
brews
i
wonder
to
what
extent
the
beers
high
rating
selfperpetuates
additional
high
scores
o
deliciously
drinkable
despite
of
the
high
abv
perfect
belgian
trappist
perfect
belgian
quad
not
as
good
as
rochefort
10
but
this
is
another
story
finally
westy
12
poured
from
a
bottle
into
a
chimay
glass
its
the
only
trappist
glass
that
i
own
beer
was
brown
mostly
clear
until
the
mud
at
the
bottom
of
the
glass
came
out
this
was
avoidable
i
know
how
to
pour
the
head
was
diffuse
but
present
and
the
carbonation
was
slow
but
steady
continuously
replenishing
the
thin
head
the
smell
was
amazing
beautiful
yeasty
and
sweet
smell
the
taste
and
mouthfeel
were
out
of
this
world
it
was
smooth
i
could
have
drank
the
whole
thing
in
a
few
minutes
but
i
savored
it
for
as
long
as
possible
taste
was
sweet
and
pleasant
more
yeast
no
aftertaste
a
perfect
beer
i
wish
i
could
have
ti
year
round
pours
a
rusty
brown
with
a
thin
but
dense
white
head
leaves
lots
of
lacing
the
color
is
not
terribly
appealing
the
smell
is
of
roasted
nuts
hijiki
seaweed
sweet
grape
a
rich
caramel
malt
very
complex
the
flavor
is
sweet
grapes
like
cognac
almost
caramel
grain
with
a
lingering
bitter
earthy
finish
its
creamy
but
clean
in
the
mouth
not
at
all
viscous
very
nice
really
just
too
delectable
for
words
more
d
im
loving
this
although
im
not
sure
it
soundly
beats
out
others
like
the
abt
12
and
rocheforte
10
definitely
a
great
drink
worth
the
try
although
i
probably
wont
get
it
again
because
of
the
price
i
think
i
built
this
up
too
much
in
my
head
it
is
definitely
not
on
the
top
of
this
hopheads
list
but
still
an
amazing
beer
that
i
would
highly
recomend
conclusion
wow
truly
one
of
its
kind
deserves
an
a
easily
perfectly
balanced
beer
outstanding
d
ridiculously
drinkable
it
took
quite
a
bit
of
restraint
to
not
put
down
the
westy
12s
i
had
at
in
de
vrede
in
two
minutes
every
time
you
take
a
sip
of
this
stuff
you
instantly
want
another
bottle
pours
dark
brown
with
a
white
head
has
a
brown
sugar
aroma
to
it
with
some
malt
undertones
mouthfeel
is
mediumlight
with
a
lot
of
tiny
bubbles
for
carbonation
i
really
like
the
feel
of
this
beer
taste
is
very
complex
there
is
candi
sugar
dark
fruit
some
sweet
malt
and
a
small
amount
of
hop
spice
alcohol
is
hidden
very
well
the
blend
of
malt
hops
mouthfeel
and
finish
makes
this
a
supreme
beer
truly
world
class
just
excellent
cheers
so
i
have
finally
had
the
highly
renowned
westvleteren
12
tonight
i
tried
this
beer
along
side
the
st
bernardus
12
which
was
my
favorite
trappist
beer
up
to
this
point
ive
also
had
the
rochefort
10
but
after
drinking
these
two
i
think
i
need
to
try
it
again
drinking
the
st
berndardus
and
westvleteren
head
to
head
has
really
helped
define
the
differences
in
these
beers
in
terms
of
appearance
the
st
bernardus
looks
much
more
attractive
to
me
however
i
found
myself
liking
the
overall
flavor
of
the
westvleteren
more
and
since
beer
is
mostly
about
flavor
i
tip
my
hat
to
the
westy
it
truly
is
an
exceptional
beer
pretty
good
id
say
not
sure
if
this
becomes
my
definitive
quad
but
for
sure
its
a
very
interesting
one
and
appreciably
complex
i
wouldnt
mind
sipping
away
at
it
again
well
i
have
had
it
nothing
else
to
drink
now
overall
this
is
one
beer
that
lives
up
to
its
hype
coupling
its
quality
with
its
rarity
makes
this
beer
a
real
treat
unbelievably
drinkable
for
the
alcohol
content
extremely
hard
to
get
unfortunately
and
althought
it
is
easily
one
of
my
favorites
of
all
time
but
i
think
i
just
prefer
my
riss
better
initially
the
high
carbonation
is
a
little
bit
offputting
but
as
it
warms
and
dies
down
it
becomes
much
more
pleasing
i
didnt
really
understand
the
darker
complex
belgians
when
i
began
my
journey
beers
like
this
rochefort
810
and
st
bernardus
12
really
help
in
making
sense
of
the
magical
and
mythical
works
of
the
trappists
d
its
a
great
beer
but
in
almost
a
dozen
bottles
of
having
this
i
cant
recall
one
that
was
above
a
wisp
of
carbonation
maybe
i
have
bad
luck
or
maybe
this
beer
just
lacks
in
that
department
i
dont
care
for
that
given
the
difficulty
of
acquiring
it
i
give
the
nod
to
st
bernardus
12
here
thank
you
hophead101
an
excellent
beer
and
the
world
number
one
if
not
mine
i
can
see
why
people
like
it
but
for
me
it
doesnt
stand
out
from
the
crowd
poured
into
my
trappist
westvleteren
goblet
after
getting
a
hole
in
one
yesterday
what
a
way
to
celebrate
dark
opaque
brown
with
a
frothy
two
finger
head
some
minor
lacing
down
the
glass
smell
was
heavenly
dark
fruits
malty
with
some
spice
sweet
taste
was
similar
very
complex
sweet
and
dry
at
the
same
time
very
rich
fruit
flavor
figs
raisins
dates
amazing
how
long
down
the
throat
the
flavors
continue
as
it
warmed
it
was
slightly
easier
to
taste
the
10
abv
mouthfeel
was
really
good
with
a
high
degree
of
carbonation
to
keep
all
corners
of
the
pallette
involved
in
the
pleasure
drinkability
from
a
flavor
standpoint
is
good
but
this
one
sneeks
up
on
you
a
powerhouse
of
alcohol
this
beer
is
not
all
hype
well
worth
the
money
mouthfeel
chewy
full
bodied
low
carbonation
which
suited
the
beer
nicely
d
goes
down
very
well
i
drank
slowly
to
enjoy
the
taste
however
it
tastes
better
when
it
is
gulped
one
of
my
friends
said
this
and
i
agree
this
is
a
much
better
gulper
than
a
sipper
you
do
the
math
d
very
good
could
drink
a
bunch
but
wouldnt
want
to
over
due
it
either
this
is
totally
a
highly
drinkable
brew
but
honestly
if
im
going
to
drink
a
quad
which
i
often
do
id
probably
reach
for
a
different
one
than
this
first
finally
i
have
this
legendary
beer
in
my
glass
the
bottle
looks
really
good
no
label
which
brewery
can
do
that
dark
in
the
glass
almost
black
nice
head
starts
strong
and
malty
modest
sweetness
notes
of
wood
and
a
bit
liquorice
not
as
strong
as
exspected
very
drinkable
for
its
strength
warming
finish
really
great
beer
d
awesome
the
most
amaing
thing
ive
tasted
in
a
long
time
brought
back
a
couple
of
bottles
from
brussels
last
summer
and
aged
for
a
little
over
ayear
pours
a
nice
brown
with
white
head
and
smells
of
sweet
malts
carbonation
is
just
right
and
allows
for
excellent
drinability
just
has
a
crazy
mild
sweetnees
that
hides
the
high
alcohol
content
yes
it
tastes
a
little
like
grape
soda
at
some
points
overall
not
necessarily
the
best
beer
ive
ever
had
but
probably
the
most
balanced
with
such
a
high
alcohol
content
d
exceptionally
drinkable
given
the
abv
could
have
3
or
4
of
these
in
a
sitting
if
i
were
so
lucky
4
5
pours
dark
brown
head
lots
going
on
in
the
aroma
dark
fruits
sherry
candy
quite
a
bit
going
on
here
flavor
is
very
complex
fruit
funk
alcohol
caramel
chocolate
finishes
highly
carbonated
but
doesnt
get
in
the
way
of
the
beer
i
could
still
use
less
carbonation
on
this
one
light
alcohol
notes
which
melded
well
with
the
beer
without
taking
away
from
the
flavors
overall
i
can
see
why
people
would
enjoy
this
if
big
boozy
belgians
are
your
thing
i
personally
dont
have
the
want
to
drink
this
more
than
once
a
year
at
most
thanks
to
atsprings
for
splitting
this
bottle
many
thanks
to
afatty
for
the
inperson
trade
poured
into
a
corsendonk
tulip
a
hazy
murky
brown
with
a
nice
light
tan
head
that
lasts
as
a
thin
layer
that
leaves
slight
lacing
on
the
glass
the
aroma
is
an
incredible
blend
of
sweet
fruits
brown
sugar
clove
spices
and
numerous
other
aromas
that
just
add
up
to
spectacular
the
taste
is
more
of
the
same
just
about
everything
you
look
for
in
a
beer
all
melded
perfectly
into
one
the
beer
is
medium
bodied
with
decent
alcohol
presence
but
with
a
taste
that
good
you
barely
notice
this
one
certainly
lives
up
to
the
hype
and
thanks
to
afattys
generosity
i
look
forward
to
trying
it
again
what
it
all
comes
down
to
is
that
every
time
you
pick
out
a
flavor
with
this
one
theres
a
subtlety
and
clarity
to
it
that
is
just
striking
everything
just
rings
true
with
every
aspect
of
it
im
humbled
to
be
drinking
this
thanks
to
the
generosity
of
a
man
i
feel
truly
blessed
to
have
met
through
this
website
which
only
adds
to
the
depth
of
quality
i
suppose
lives
up
to
the
hype
bottle
at
pprbsg09
pours
a
dark
murky
brown
with
a
thick
white
head
aroma
is
very
fruitylots
of
dark
fruits
plum
apple
and
fig
plus
some
honey
flavor
is
nice
and
fruity
with
yeast
notes
and
a
rich
malt
base
the
palate
sort
of
had
a
pulplike
quality
to
me
very
nice
and
delicious
i
cant
wait
to
try
this
again
this
is
a
great
beer
but
i
believe
just
a
notch
below
rochefort
10
di
really
feel
ashamed
to
be
chugging
this
like
i
am
i
cant
help
it
this
is
spectacular
this
and
hotd
adam
are
the
two
most
drinkable
10
abv
beers
i
have
ever
had
all
around
this
beer
is
amazing
mind
blowing
unbelievable
the
hype
is
real
i
need
more
i
will
get
more
i
must
get
more
this
brew
was
born
in
november
of
2008
which
makes
it
only
half
a
year
old
i
must
say
that
i
got
a
little
anxious
to
try
this
one
still
have
one
more
that
i
plan
on
aging
for
a
long
while
davey
shared
this
bottle
with
me
when
we
drank
my
westy
8
poured
into
goblet
a
still
murky
yeasty
brown
with
no
head
smelled
of
dark
fruit
brandy
taste
of
dark
fruit
as
well
raisin
cherry
fig
a
little
warm
in
the
finish
this
was
pretty
fizzy
in
the
mouth
which
surprised
me
as
it
didnt
look
very
carbonated
when
i
poured
it
amazing
beer
and
im
glad
i
was
able
to
sample
this
d
what
to
say
about
this
legendary
brew
well
i
think
its
almost
as
good
as
its
reputation
say
it
is
its
just
unbelievably
tasty
with
an
impressive
complex
character
this
one
comes
really
close
to
perfection
smells
of
bourbon
raisins
dark
fruits
honey
candi
sugar
and
a
phenol
character
tastes
of
fruit
honey
and
dark
malts
the
mouthfeel
is
nicely
carbonated
tingles
the
tongue
and
finishes
smooth
the
sweetness
carbonation
and
alcohol
warming
character
of
this
beer
mend
together
perfectly
drinkability
is
exceptional
i
could
enjoy
this
all
night
medium
bodied
with
a
soft
carbonation
bottle
reads
a
date
on
the
cap
of
19
11
11
beer
poured
into
my
westvleteren
goblet
is
rich
dark
brown
in
color
no
head
or
lacing
to
speak
of
has
me
a
bit
worried
given
this
beers
rich
tradition
nose
is
wonderful
and
complex
notes
of
candi
sugar
dark
fruit
anise
and
caramel
taste
is
complex
as
well
and
nearly
as
great
as
the
boquet
amazing
synthesis
of
flavors
mouthfeel
is
too
thin
and
the
beer
lacked
enough
carbonation
alcohol
was
there
but
overwhelmed
by
the
amazing
flavor
a
great
beer
but
i
would
like
to
have
one
with
a
bit
more
carbonation
myself
capra12
and
jimmy
were
in
agreement
that
we
simply
cannot
wait
to
enjoy
this
beer
again
a
classic
that
i
would
love
to
have
again
i
bought
this
bottle
in
2003
so
it
had
some
time
on
it
i
was
let
down
with
this
beer
could
have
been
a
variety
of
reasons
maybe
held
onto
it
too
long
i
would
give
it
another
try
easily
the
best
beer
ive
had
yes
theres
a
degree
of
mystique
added
given
that
its
also
so
rare
but
seriously
try
it
overall
this
was
an
excellent
beer
i
can
see
why
it
is
the
best
in
the
world
i
personally
would
not
give
it
such
a
grand
title
because
of
its
less
than
steller
lacing
and
mouth
feel
however
this
is
truly
a
great
beer
that
i
found
myself
in
awe
of
overall
i
was
very
happy
to
try
this
beer
but
i
really
wanted
to
be
blown
away
but
unfortunately
i
wasnt
i
would
still
drink
this
in
a
heartbeat
but
the
price
of
a
bottle
just
wasnt
worth
it
to
me
though
this
was
one
of
the
more
enjoyable
beers
ive
ever
had
i
think
its
hype
and
limited
availability
have
propelled
it
to
1
its
deserving
of
a
top
10
but
for
its
rarity
i
think
st
bernardus
abt
12
makes
a
great
substitute
overall
i
enjoyed
this
one
very
much
one
of
the
best
examples
of
this
style
out
there
although
probably
not
number
one
according
to
my
personal
tastes
still
this
would
definitely
be
a
regular
if
it
were
more
readily
available
it
is
1
for
a
reason
please
try
it
if
you
can
the
best
beer
in
the
world
a
lot
of
the
hype
certainly
comes
from
how
difficult
it
is
to
obtain
its
certainly
a
worldclass
beer
well
just
leave
it
at
that
those
monks
sure
know
how
to
brew
a
fantastic
beer
pristine
condition
cap
said
oct
08
as
the
brew
or
bottle
date
stunner
of
a
nose
best
ive
ever
had
warm
it
was
very
silky
satin
smooth
ect
ect
great
balance
acidity
woodsy
super
finish
cooled
down
a
bit
more
chocolate
came
out
but
the
best
milk
chocolate
you
could
ever
imagine
with
muddled
fruits
super
finish
could
drink
this
all
day
every
day
lives
up
to
the
hype
and
the
best
beer
ive
ever
had
this
is
a
very
nice
treat
at
10usd
while
over
in
belgium
i
saw
at
the
most
in
brugge
and
at
differing
prices
my
first
experience
with
this
beer
a
few
years
ago
at
the
abbey
cafe
was
completely
unforgettable
overall
quite
impressed
and
appreciative
of
the
opportunity
to
try
it
definitely
world
class
what
a
great
beer
i
can
certainly
see
why
its
the
top
rated
in
the
world
while
its
not
my
highest
rated
beer
its
certainly
deserving
of
its
praise
very
drinkable
despite
the
high
abv
which
is
virtually
absent
in
the
taste
so
good
i
will
cherish
the
remaining
bottles
i
have
and
drink
them
a
bottle
at
a
time
over
the
next
few
years
thanks
again
jason
i
love
old
stouts
and
some
of
the
crazy
extreme
beers
that
are
now
being
produced
however
for
overall
quality
and
flavor
this
is
probably
the
best
ale
ive
ever
tasted
i
hope
i
can
try
it
again
dont
miss
this
one
if
you
get
the
chance
definitely
one
of
the
best
beers
i
have
ever
had
the
westvleteren
is
1
year
aged
pours
a
hazy
mahogany
with
a
decent
sized
head
it
looked
like
it
would
be
a
gusher
at
first
but
didnt
quite
make
it
over
the
top
the
head
dissipates
quickly
it
smells
largely
of
dark
fruits
with
a
bitterness
combined
with
it
there
is
also
a
sweetness
combined
with
it
as
well
the
alcohol
comes
through
slightly
in
the
smell
but
not
to
strong
the
taste
is
filled
with
tons
of
spices
and
dark
fruits
the
alcohol
has
largely
mellowed
into
the
taste
though
there
is
a
warming
sensation
to
the
beer
the
bitterness
blends
nicely
into
the
taste
though
there
is
a
slight
dry
aftertaste
the
mouthfeel
is
as
smooth
as
ive
ever
had
a
beer
the
beer
goes
down
smooth
and
is
very
drinkable
if
i
ever
head
over
to
belgium
ill
enjoy
myself
a
few
not
the
most
drinkable
beer
in
my
cellar
but
i
had
to
try
it
to
see
the
hype
of
the
1
beer
around
overall
this
beer
did
not
disappoint
it
was
certainly
a
treat
and
an
honor
to
share
with
a
good
friend
the
12
oz
was
probably
the
right
amount
of
beer
for
two
people
to
drink
it
is
a
great
sipping
beer
and
would
be
a
perfect
after
dinner
or
special
occasion
beer
no
off
flavors
or
hot
alcohols
at
all
very
very
well
crafted
beer
o
this
is
truly
an
outstanding
beer
i
sure
all
the
hype
surrounding
it
adds
to
the
mystic
of
it
there
no
evidence
this
is
a
10
beer
it
is
very
well
hidden
thanks
to
my
son
geoff
for
a
great
birthday
present
if
you
get
the
chance
try
it
but
dont
pay
like
80
usd
for
it
there
are
better
beers
out
there
still
its
a
must
try
highly
recommended
after
this
time
ok
a
land
mark
review
my
first
so
i
thought
i
would
start
with
a
slam
dunk
l
darker
than
i
thought
it
would
be
very
dark
but
not
a
ris
two
finger
head
s
molasses
dark
fruits
sweet
t
same
and
stays
along
time
awesome
f
very
good
d
excellent
this
is
not
my
type
but
i
can
appreciate
this
great
great
beer
is
this
the
best
beer
in
the
world
i
dont
think
so
im
an
ris
guy
but
i
have
had
the
best
beer
in
the
world
and
that
is
a
lot
more
then
most
people
can
say
d
wish
this
beer
wasnt
so
rare
and
expensive
but
i
could
drink
this
every
day
for
the
rest
of
my
life
in
fact
if
i
ever
get
on
death
row
this
will
be
my
final
supper
thanks
again
dave
i
really
appreciate
this
one
bottle
pours
a
murky
brown
with
tan
head
the
head
lasts
well
the
head
laces
well
has
a
great
aroma
of
fruits
spices
cocoa
and
vanilla
has
perfect
carbination
and
an
awesome
mouthfeel
i
waited
a
long
time
to
get
one
of
these
and
it
is
great
the
flavors
are
very
complex
tastes
dance
on
your
tongue
has
a
medium
to
heavy
body
a
thick
texture
the
finish
is
smooth
and
perfect
this
truely
is
an
awesome
beer
the
balance
is
perfect
i
cant
think
of
any
bad
part
of
this
this
was
certainly
a
special
tasting
for
my
developing
palate
i
want
to
deeply
thank
my
friend
tyler
for
blessing
me
with
this
pinnacle
of
beer
as
a
26th
birthday
present
this
superior
belgian
ale
poured
an
opaque
cloudy
dark
amber
hue
from
the
bottle
the
perfection
in
this
brew
lies
in
both
the
flavor
and
the
balance
the
flavor
is
complex
yet
sweet
on
the
tongue
at
first
with
hints
of
banana
raisins
plums
strawberries
and
dates
the
finish
is
of
smokey
dark
fruit
with
a
pleasant
warmth
of
alcohol
down
the
throat
this
ale
truly
has
every
important
aspect
you
could
hope
for
in
a
beer
the
flavors
work
in
perfect
harmony
together
with
neither
over
powering
one
another
the
carbonation
is
subdued
yet
present
enough
to
remind
you
that
this
is
a
truly
special
belgian
ale
i
am
truly
amazed
at
the
subtle
yet
complex
collection
of
flavors
present
in
this
ale
for
those
that
are
considering
trying
this
ale
for
the
first
time
please
take
my
advice
and
enjoy
all
of
the
wonderful
flavors
at
room
temperature
this
brew
achieves
true
perfection
and
i
am
honored
to
have
experienced
the
worlds
greatest
ale
on
my
birthday
thank
you
tyler
overall
again
very
glad
to
have
tried
this
brew
and
it
is
indeed
wonderful
stuff
the
flavors
and
warming
touch
of
booze
really
provided
a
pleasant
experience
against
the
style
it
might
just
be
the
best
ive
had
as
to
whether
its
the
best
brew
in
the
world
im
not
quite
sure
definitely
try
it
if
you
have
the
chance
d
i
am
going
to
revisit
this
one
as
much
as
possible
but
this
beer
is
not
something
id
consider
going
to
a
bunch
every
now
and
then
will
keep
this
one
special
you
have
to
be
brain
dead
to
not
like
this
beer
it
was
a
religious
experience
it
smelled
like
a
church
tasted
like
heaven
and
had
the
body
of
the
holy
trinity
but
if
youre
reviewing
this
beer
im
not
telling
you
anything
you
dont
know
not
sure
how
you
get
much
better
than
this
pours
slightly
fogged
brown
nose
is
malty
darker
sugars
flavor
is
bringing
much
of
the
same
i
want
to
say
it
is
kind
of
boozy
as
well
not
sure
if
some
age
would
mellow
that
out
malty
plums
start
to
appear
as
it
warms
rich
yes
smooth
yes
feel
is
quite
smooth
on
liquid
carbonation
is
middle
of
the
road
i
like
this
yes
its
good
but
i
feel
like
this
is
a
bit
tight
and
might
need
more
age
to
develop
more
noticeable
complexities
and
its
certainly
not
my
favorite
beer
ever
this
is
a
very
drinkable
beer
you
need
to
sip
it
because
of
the
higher
alcohol
but
its
really
fun
to
drink
very
dynamic
most
definitely
worth
trying
if
you
can
get
ahold
of
a
bottle
do
it
this
would
go
really
well
with
a
good
meal
my
wife
said
this
beer
was
savory
and
sweet
like
a
good
roast
i
could
see
this
going
well
with
a
big
platter
of
fruit
crusty
bread
and
cheese
d
the
high
alcohol
content
would
prevent
a
huge
consumption
of
it
but
as
its
not
noticeable
so
it
doesnt
prevent
me
from
wanting
more
it
actually
went
down
really
easily
and
overall
it
was
a
really
enjoyable
brew
id
gladly
buy
more
if
i
could
find
it
and
it
wasnt
so
expensive
d
it
was
easy
to
drink
and
fun
for
sure
nothing
that
i
could
drink
all
day
or
on
a
regular
basis
but
was
damn
easy
to
drink
a
nice
beer
with
a
unique
blend
of
cherries
and
brown
nut
malt
caramel
malts
tones
at
first
i
was
best
beer
in
the
world
but
it
started
to
grow
on
me
with
each
sip
i
kept
it
on
my
tongue
and
rolled
it
around
the
mouthfeel
is
luscious
with
a
perfect
balance
of
carbonation
and
dryness
i
havent
felt
that
since
say
st
benardus
12
but
st
benardus
isnt
a
substitute
for
the
fruitiness
that
this
beer
imparts
i
expected
more
in
the
aroma
department
but
the
flavor
more
than
makes
up
for
it
d
not
sessionable
but
the
10
plus
percent
is
hardly
evident
in
the
taste
or
feel
and
this
is
a
wonderful
quad
what
else
can
i
say
well
one
thing
is
each
sip
is
better
than
the
last
sip
i
took
westy
12
is
a
creamy
sweet
ride
with
a
body
of
epic
proportions
cant
wait
till
i
try
it
again
pours
an
amber
brown
with
a
small
head
that
quiclkly
fades
away
the
nose
on
this
baby
is
amazing
lots
of
sweet
malts
dark
fruits
plums
figs
raisins
and
candi
sugar
there
is
soo
much
complexity
some
alcohol
in
there
as
well
taste
is
similar
to
smell
very
complex
dark
fruits
candi
sugar
not
as
much
alcohol
as
the
smell
would
indicate
feels
nice
in
your
mouth
good
carbonation
and
kind
of
creamy
when
swallowed
this
was
an
amazing
beer
what
else
can
i
say
i
mean
its
westvleteren
12
what
an
experience
this
is
my
first
review
on
this
site
but
by
no
means
is
this
my
first
beer
or
review
at
this
rate
i
doubt
i
will
find
a
better
beer
if
you
can
find
it
try
belgian
stores
or
trade
here
pull
the
trigger
on
it
and
dont
think
twice
perfect
not
the
best
beer
in
the
world
or
the
best
beer
ive
evr
had
but
goddamn
does
it
rank
up
there
i
wasnt
expecting
perfection
but
i
was
hoping
for
more
very
good
if
i
get
another
bottle
ill
take
more
notes
and
compare
the
results
my
only
perfect
beer
there
can
be
only
one
overall
must
go
to
belgium
great
beer
not
that
it
needs
my
endorsement
i
look
forward
to
trying
this
with
some
age
on
it
a
very
good
beer
made
the
rocherfort
10
seem
rather
boring
had
a
tasting
at
my
house
this
past
weekend
and
the
first
beer
up
was
the
westy
12
appearance
was
good
not
allot
of
head
out
of
every
bottle
but
a
good
amount
color
was
a
nice
cloudy
dark
brown
and
looked
very
yummy
smell
was
not
overwhelmingly
intense
but
was
there
and
was
a
big
hint
to
the
complex
taste
that
was
about
to
happen
sweet
malts
was
a
dominate
taste
with
very
next
up
dark
fruits
like
raisins
and
figs
etc
the
taste
its
self
had
everyone
take
a
step
back
and
honestly
look
at
each
others
expressions
dark
fruits
raisins
and
figs
powered
threw
with
sweet
malts
more
flavors
were
present
but
could
not
pick
each
one
out
as
the
beer
was
so
complex
a
bite
of
alcohol
was
present
and
was
a
pleasant
addition
the
bit
of
alcohol
would
probably
hamper
the
continuous
bottle
after
another
bottle
i
feel
for
me
at
least
this
beer
was
meant
to
be
a
one
to
two
bottle
a
session
beer
m
light
fluffy
and
highly
carbonated
which
i
was
expecting
for
the
style
what
i
wasnt
expecting
was
how
smooth
this
one
was
going
to
be
have
a
few
more
bottles
and
am
looking
forward
to
how
this
one
tastes
with
age
notes
the
best
of
its
style
easily
i
see
why
it
is
held
in
as
high
regard
as
it
is
exceedingly
drinkable
despite
the
high
abv
percentage
d
great
beer
has
a
nice
warming
effect
perfect
beer
to
drink
while
relaxing
i
was
obviously
looking
forward
to
this
beer
and
it
did
not
disappoint
a
brew
that
everyone
should
experience
for
mine
its
not
the
holy
grail
yes
the
westy
12
is
worthy
of
the
hype
is
it
worth
the
money
that
you
have
to
pay
for
it
well
i
guess
that
depends
on
how
much
money
you
make
i
will
most
certainly
buy
more
but
its
not
something
i
can
afford
to
drink
even
on
a
similar
regular
basis
yes
this
is
my
new
favorite
beer
d
i
had
to
force
myself
from
chuggin
this
beer
down
the
smell
taste
and
mouthfeel
is
just
incredibly
smooth
making
this
a
5
on
drinkability
as
its
like
no
other
ive
now
had
eight
of
the
top
10
beers
on
ba
and
can
confidently
say
that
the
westies
dark
lord
and
the
plinies
are
not
overhyped
they
are
the
best
examples
of
their
respective
styles
that
ive
tasted
it
is
too
bad
that
we
have
to
split
this
beer
due
its
lack
of
availablity
but
i
am
glad
that
we
have
friends
that
would
bring
over
what
most
agree
as
the
best
beer
in
the
world
on
a
sunday
night
just
because
could
sip
this
one
by
the
fire
all
night
i
think
that
a
is
ruined
for
all
future
quads
by
this
one
much
hype
but
definitely
worth
seeking
out
d
yes
too
strong
to
have
more
than
a
couple
though
md
the
texture
is
blissful
incredibly
satisfying
and
rounded
with
utterly
smooth
carbonation
to
complement
a
full
but
never
thick
body
all
in
all
theres
no
drama
here
no
big
flavours
or
overpowering
elements
to
dominate
the
scene
only
a
brilliantly
structured
evolving
flavour
profile
proceeds
from
one
stage
to
the
other
just
seamlessly
i
cant
work
out
how
dry
and
bitter
it
could
smoothly
transform
into
in
the
rounded
finish
given
the
oily
malty
foretaste
while
consistently
theres
neither
any
trace
of
big
alc
nor
sticky
sugary
mouthfeel
this
might
have
been
the
smoothest
and
harmonious
quadruple
that
ive
had
the
luck
to
try
if
it
could
be
obtained
at
a
much
lower
price
i
was
charged
us18
by
the
belgian
shop
i
wish
to
sip
one
bottle
of
this
ale
a
month
just
to
remind
myself
how
blissful
and
tranquil
the
beer
world
can
be
without
much
pretence
and
loudness
thanks
again
josh
for
this
tasty
brew
i
have
to
say
the
spicy
malts
of
this
beer
are
like
no
other
ive
tried
and
its
not
the
spice
flavor
you
find
in
some
winter
beers
where
you
they
just
dumped
a
can
of
nutmeg
cinnamon
and
the
like
in
a
pot
and
called
it
a
winter
beer
also
can
be
found
in
bruges
maybe
its
the
thought
of
enjoying
this
for
the
very
first
time
but
this
dows
go
down
very
quickly
it
definitely
takes
a
while
for
that
one
offflavor
the
floral
soap
to
burn
off
its
weirdness
note
no
real
mention
of
booziness
on
the
taste
or
palate
profile
after
the
initial
rum
raisin
ice
cream
scent
it
simply
isnt
an
issue
my
guess
is
that
i
should
probably
invest
in
a
case
of
this
some
day
to
evaluate
over
time
because
merely
one
bottle
isnt
enough
with
many
extreme
offerings
the
flavors
and
notions
are
in
your
face
so
that
theres
no
mistake
this
treasure
is
definitely
more
subtle
and
takes
a
little
more
time
to
figure
out
great
complex
construction
a
special
treat
for
my
wife
and
i
on
our
anniversary
as
she
is
a
huge
belgian
fan
pours
a
hazy
deep
brown
color
with
huge
2
finger
thick
head
that
quickly
evaporates
into
my
goblet
little
darker
than
i
expect
from
a
quad
the
smell
was
striking
to
me
and
in
a
good
way
it
was
nice
mix
of
the
sweetness
of
raisins
and
honey
and
an
almost
red
wine
alcohol
smell
a
very
unique
and
very
enticing
smell
the
complex
aroma
is
definitely
a
forebearer
of
the
taste
a
blend
of
a
malty
sweet
backbone
with
spices
and
that
red
wine
character
i
am
not
a
huge
wine
advocate
so
i
cannot
describe
it
any
more
specifically
and
have
never
used
a
wine
reference
in
a
beer
review
it
just
fits
here
medium
carbonization
and
a
medium
density
makes
this
rest
nicely
in
the
mouth
allowing
you
to
enjoy
all
the
complexities
of
the
flavor
the
abv
is
also
superbly
masked
by
the
complex
flavor
worthy
of
its
lofty
status
indeed
notes
well
there
you
have
it
this
is
the
highest
rated
beer
in
the
world
at
least
here
on
ba
and
i
believe
other
places
too
and
it
is
deserving
of
the
honor
this
my
friend
is
the
king
of
beers
d
great
i
could
drink
this
beer
all
night
unfortunately
i
only
have
the
1
sigh
is
this
the
best
beer
in
the
world
i
dont
know
i
havent
had
them
all
yet
but
it
is
definitely
the
best
damn
beer
ive
ever
had
12oz
bottle
with
13
08
11
marked
on
the
gold
cap
dark
murky
brown
with
a
an
odd
smattering
of
bubbles
almost
like
a
slime
smells
nice
caramel
sugar
raisins
but
not
as
good
as
the
8
it
tastes
boozy
brown
sugar
sweet
cherry
syrup
tastes
like
a
good
quad
to
me
overall
i
preferred
the
8
to
the
12
but
i
usually
prefer
dubbels
after
hearing
all
the
hype
i
can
say
this
is
a
truly
amazing
beer
and
it
was
a
true
honor
to
sample
it
this
is
a
standout
complex
brew
will
i
go
way
out
of
my
way
to
buy
3
cases
and
get
them
home
from
belgium
one
day
damn
right
i
will
mouthfeeldrinkability
in
a
word
sublime
the
texture
is
pure
velvet
bringing
out
all
of
the
complex
flavors
as
good
as
it
possibly
could
get
this
was
tasted
blind
against
seven
other
examples
of
this
style
and
it
lives
up
to
the
incredibly
high
standards
and
expectations
weve
all
heard
about
i
would
seek
this
out
again
without
question
this
is
a
very
drinkable
beer
hides
the
alcohol
very
well
very
tasty
and
surely
one
of
the
best
beers
i
have
tried
easy
top
3
as
for
being
the
best
beer
in
the
world
i
would
say
there
are
a
couple
better
ones
out
there
i
tried
i
love
it
aged
or
not
aged
this
really
is
wonderful
i
cant
wait
to
have
another
i
only
received
8
of
these
so
im
going
to
do
my
damnedest
to
cellar
some
but
i
have
a
feeling
i
will
fail
miserably
thats
okay
too
p
this
beer
is
excellent
for
sure
especially
for
its
style
time
to
have
another
on
the
whole
this
is
a
magnificently
made
beer
and
understandably
rated
as
such
for
a
true
belgian
beer
fan
this
may
be
the
end
allbe
all
of
beer
for
someone
such
as
myself
who
much
prefers
other
styles
of
beer
this
is
appreciated
for
what
is
a
beer
made
with
consummate
skill
but
to
my
taste
not
the
greatest
beer
in
the
world
overall
a
fond
memory
a
either
i
have
now
tried
the
beer
both
fresh
and
after
5
years
in
the
kulminator
cellar
overall
i
would
say
the
cellared
version
was
the
more
complex
better
tasting
beer
but
it
had
lost
much
of
its
carbonation
whichever
way
you
choose
to
drink
it
it
is
a
fantastic
beer
d
this
beer
was
worth
the
wait
i
certainly
do
wish
access
was
better
and
easier
and
that
ease
of
procurement
wouldnt
take
anything
away
from
the
beer
it
does
live
up
to
the
hype
pours
an
nice
deep
caramel
brown
with
a
decent
head
that
dissipates
rather
quickly
the
smell
for
me
was
probably
the
worst
part
it
doesnt
smell
as
good
as
it
tastes
but
it
still
smells
pretty
damn
good
sweet
malts
and
candied
sugars
make
this
beer
incredibly
easy
to
drink
would
love
to
try
this
with
a
couple
of
years
on
it
i
wish
i
had
it
every
day
as
this
would
easily
be
my
everyday
go
to
beer
really
in
a
category
of
its
own
excellent
beer
one
of
the
few
beers
really
worth
the
hype
nice
mouthfeel
very
smooth
with
medium
carbonation
the
feeling
as
it
glides
across
the
palate
is
almost
indescribable
a
true
sipper
that
i
would
love
to
savor
throughout
the
night
if
only
i
could
obtain
a
decent
amount
worth
of
it
now
all
i
have
to
do
is
make
a
trip
to
belgium
so
i
can
hopefully
obtain
a
full
case
worth
for
about
40
bucks
trying
this
should
be
a
goal
of
any
ba
and
i
am
just
glad
i
was
able
to
fulfill
it
even
to
this
small
extent
so
early
in
my
journey
hype
yep
live
up
to
it
yep
glad
ive
had
the
opportunity
to
have
this
a
few
times
seek
it
out
if
you
love
beer
obviously
all
hail

so
smooth

with
an

i
was
not
at

let
down
by
this
incredible
trappist
offering
and
really
savored
the
changing
qualities
of
the
brew
as
it
warmed
overall
a
great
beer
however
with
that
being
said
i
think
rochefort
10
and
st
bernardus
are
definitely
its
equal
i
might
even
have
to
rate
the
rochefort
10
higher
than
it
perhaps
there
is
even
a
bit
of
disappointment
for
holding
and
coveting
the
beer
so
long
that
it
can
never
reach
the
expectations
that
you
have
set
for
it
i
am
honored
to
have
tried
this
gem
it
wont
rank
as
my
favorite
beer
but
i
can
certainly
see
why
its
so
well
respected
im
very
glad
i
had
the
chance
to
try
this
and
will
jump
on
the
opportunity
if
i
have
it
again
worth
the
trade
and
then
some

i
wish
i
could

keep

just
not

tried
to
keep
an
open

and
not
get
sucked
into
the
previous
hype
about
this
beer
very

i
will
reserve
obtaining

for

a

be

though
this
is
certainly
a
great
beer
i
would
definitely
not
say
that
its
the
best
in
the
world
personally
i
prefer
rochefort
10
over
this
and
that
one
is
incredibly
easier
to
obtain
if
this
was
as
available
as
rochefort
i
doubt
that
it
would
be
rated
as
high
as
it
is
its
just
one
of
those
beers
you
have
to
try
though
so
if
you
can
i
would
highly
recommend
trading
for
it
sweet
without
being
cloying
not
overpowered
with
booze
i
cant
say
this
is
the
best
beer
ive
ever
had
but
its
a
damn
good
quadrupel
better
with
every
warmed
up
sip
ill
let
the
last
one
sit
a
bit
before
i
pop
it
open
thanks
to
eric
for
this
amazing
brew
from
a
bottle
that
is
a
few
years
aged
the
taste
was
amazingly
smooth
a
great
body
and
head
the
overall
taste
is
fruity
perhaps
raisins
or
prunes
with
a
sweeter
strawberry
but
the
fruity
taste
is
also
combined
with
hops
and
some
spices
awesome
no
need
to
say
anything
but
top
notch
a
buddy
of
mine
shipped
4
of
these
to
me
for
when
he
was
home
from
iraq
on
rr
thanks
again
mike
we
were
definately
not
let
down
im
not
sure
if
its
the
best
beer
in
the
world
but
it
sure
cant
be
far
down
the
list
pours
a
beautiful
dark
color
with
a
couple
finger
head
in
a
chimay
goblet
first
taste
is
very
very
smooth
with
an
abundance
of
flavors
drinks
extremely
smooth
without
a
harsh
alcohol
taste
for
such
a
strong
beer
overall
one
of
the
best
beers
ive
had
the
pleasure
of
drinkingeven
for
a
hophead
like
me
a
trip
to
the
monastery
is
in
my
future
hopefully
i
would
recommend
this
one
to
anyone
wow
id
love
to
put
some
age
on
a
bottle
and
see
how
it
develops
wonderful
beer
thanks
again
for
the
hookup
randy
its
hard
to
judge
while
finely
crafted
its
certainly
not
my
personal
favorite
rochefort
10
has
surpassed
this
at
times
and
other
bottles
fall
short
one
to
savor
and
recognize
as
a
benchmark
quadrupel
i
had
to
search
far
and
wide
even
in
brugges
to
find
this
beer
and
im
glad
i
did
drank
a
bottle
at
an
amazing
pub
there
and
brought
a
couple
home
overall
my
brother
got
this
beer
delivered
for
my
21st
birthday
and
i
know
hell
read
this
review
so
thanks
again
however
i
had
many
fears
that
what
i
had
received
would
not
live
up
to
its
reputation
i
had
heard
stories
about
westvleterens
supposedly
deteriorating
significantly
when
transported
overseas
also
the
fact
that
one
of
the
beers
i
received
was
not
in
the
usual
westvleteren
bottle
sparked
fears
that
i
may
have
received
a
cheap
recapped
ripoff
however
the
first
taste
assured
me
that
this
was
the
real
deal
though
i
have
given
this
a
much
higher
score
than
any
other
beer
i
do
not
feel
that
i
have
been
generous
in
any
way
with
my
scoring
i
cant
recommend
this
beer
enough
i
had
it
at
the
cafe
in
de
vrede
across
the
street
from
the
st
sixtus
abbey
that
brews
the
beer
in
westvleteren
awesome
ruby
brown
in
color
with
shades
of
rust
and
copper
medium
head
but
not
near
the
retention
of
some
in
its
class
its
still
falls
slowly
to
a
ring
leaving
random
lacing
down
the
glass
smell
is
amazing
not
as
big
and
rich
in
the
malt
department
it
makes
you
anticipate
a
slightly
less
full
body
compared
to
others
great
scent
of
fruits
some
grape
raisin
plum
pear
and
fig
more
fruity
than
anything
still
a
good
touch
of
candyi
sugar
and
light
yeast
leather
some
caramel
is
evident
also
taste
is
just
as
amazing
good
fruit
flavors
again
not
too
thick
from
caramel
and
the
like
candy
sugar
and
a
lightly
toasted
bready
yeast
also
some
subtle
bubble
gum
flavor
a
delicate
touch
of
spice
and
candy
sugar
mouthfeel
isnt
as
velvety
as
possible
but
very
nice
more
on
the
medium
bodied
side
with
a
bit
of
spice
alcohol
is
hardly
noticeable
in
this
brew
its
a
pleasure
to
sip
on
if
possible
so
full
of
flavor
and
complexity
that
its
tough
to
beat
unbelievably
drinkable
for
what
it
is
if
you
can
get
this
beer
do
not
hesitate
you
wont
be
disappointed
not
a
technical
review
because
i
just
love
belgians
and
this
one
is
number
1
overall
a
darn
good
beer
try
it
if
you
get
a
chance
though
it
might
be
difficult
to
obtain
overall
im
glad
i
finally
was
able
to
try
this
beer
did
it
live
up
to
the
hype
yes
and
no
i
still
think
rochefort
10
is
a
better
beer
alot
cheaper
and
easier
to
find
i
guess
part
of
the
hype
with
this
beer
is
the
availability
of
it
but
dont
get
me
wrong
still
an
awesome
beer
and
as
long
as
its
rare
you
should
try
and
seek
it
out
at
least
once
i
spoke
with
the
owner
at
the
downtown
bar
and
he
said
he
has
about
10
bottles
left
right
now
i
think
alot
of
this
beer
is
hype
but
it
is
still
fantastic
yum
d
i
can
see
why
this
beer
is
ranked
as
it
is
this
beer
has
something
for
everyone
it
is
subtle
enough
in
taste
to
please
even
the
staunchest
bmc
drinker
around
no
boozy
heat
not
raging
hop
bitterness
or
cloying
malty
sweetness
this
is
just
a
perfectly
balanced
quiet
nonflashy
beer
that
is
just
an
absolute
pleasure
to
drink
drinkability
is
very
good
i
really
enjoyed
this
one
its
definitely
top
notch
excellent
and
well
worth
the
praise
however
ill
take
rochefort
10
or
pannepot
i
liked
those
2
just
a
little
bit
better
than
this
one
pours
a
deep
brown
with
a
nice
layer
of
light
brown
head
smells
of
dried
dark
fruits
with
some
nice
spiciness
and
caramel
the
taste
wow
the
taste
at
first
sip
i
thought
it
was
pretty
good
nice
and
complex
but
the
flavor
just
keeps
lingering
and
developing
fruits
sugars
a
little
doughy
definitely
some
nutiness
in
the
aftertaste
also
almost
seems
like
a
little
black
tea
on
the
finish
great
mouthfeel
sticky
but
smooth
this
beer
has
managed
to
surpass
any
expectations
i
had
while
not
the
best
beer
i
have
ever
had
it
is
certainly
one
of
the
best
and
i
believe
it
was
worth
the
hype
i
will
be
looking
to
get
more
of
this
whenever
possible
and
i
am
very
glad
to
have
been
able
to
try
it
pours
a
cloudy
dark
chestnut
brown
color
with
2
fingers
of
creamy
tan
head
into
a
tulip
glass
amazing
retention
with
beautiful
lacing
that
is
both
thick
and
sticky
and
also
slides
down
the
glass
to
reconnect
with
its
brethren
smells
of
cocoa
caramel
vanilla
honey
sweet
bread
dark
fruits
cinnamon
clove
rose
petals
coriander
candy
light
yeast
and
slight
alcohol
tastes
of
candy
fruits
like
apple
and
pear
spices
a
touch
of
citrus
juice
caramel
sweet
bready
malts
cocoa
powder
figs
plums
cherries
earthy
notes
peppercorns
a
touch
of
yeast
and
a
slight
dash
of
alcohol
an
amazing
balance
of
flavors
each
pronounced
at
first
along
the
journey
and
then
gently
fading
away
leaving
only
a
hint
of
lingering
taste
behind
smooth
and
velvety
with
a
nice
dry
finish
and
great
carbonation
simply
a
fantastic
beer
not
my
favorite
beer
of
alltime
but
definitely
the
best
quadrupel
ive
experienced
and
among
the
best
beers
out
there
for
as
high
in
abv
as
it
is
it
covers
it
up
beautifully
this
is
a
sipping
beer
but
only
because
you
dont
want
the
glass
to
run
empty
definitely
worth
a
try
whenever
you
may
find
it
d
very
easy
to
drink
i
would
love
to
get
more
of
this
hard
to
find
beer
greatest
beer
in
the
world
probably
not
but
its
not
far
off
that
mark
pours
a
dark
brown
with
no
clarity
a
thick
brownish
head
aroma
was
honey
and
ripe
fruit
and
tones
of
alcohol
very
pleasing
taste
was
very
complex
some
honey
fruit
and
alcohol
very
wellbalanced
with
sweetness
chewy
texture
with
a
slight
carbonation
fizz
very
smooth
in
the
palate
excellent
beer
good
taste
and
not
excessively
filling
it
does
pack
a
punch
which
may
put
it
out
the
desire
as
a
session
beer
but
enjoyable
none
the
less
the
best
thing
about
this
beer
is
it
goes
through
several
different
changes
during
the
process
of
drinking
it
and
all
of
them
are
great
the
pour
was
a
dark
brown
but
not
black
the
nose
came
out
with
dates
caramel
leafs
and
strong
yeast
the
texture
was
some
what
like
champagne
tasted
way
lighter
then
it
looked
i
almost
could
not
taste
the
alcohol
at
all
when
it
started
to
warm
up
i
started
getting
a
heavy
tobacco
taste
would
have
even
been
good
with
a
cigar
or
what
ever
it
is
you
put
in
your
pipe
also
some
strong
licorice
flavors
the
malt
is
perfect
and
not
heavy
at
all
not
sure
of
the
date
of
mine
but
i
would
love
to
try
one
of
these
that
as
quite
of
bit
of
age
on
it
overall
maybe
the
best
single
beer
i
have
had
wish
i
had
more
than
1
bottle
d
this
beer
is
very
drinkable
considering
its
immensely
complex
flavor
profile
and
a
10
2
abv
each
sip
leaves
you
in
anticipation
of
the
next
thanks
again
life
is
good
for
sharing
such
a
rare
brew
as
well
as
another
ba
who
will
remain
nameless
for
trading
me
one
to
put
away
for
my
son
when
he
is
legal
age
who
knows
i
may
even
split
it
60
40
lol
into
its
beautiful
chalice
it
pours
a
very
dark
yet
clear
brown
with
highlights
of
ruby
red
shining
through
the
brew
only
a
bit
of
head
crowns
the
beer
and
it
fades
to
a
delicate
lace
i
raise
the
glass
to
my
nose
and
scents
of
warm
red
grapes
cranberry
and
cherry
come
flooding
into
my
awareness
the
sweet
smell
of
fruit
caramel
and
toffee
candy
wraps
itself
so
nicely
around
the
significantly
boozy
brew
it
pours
over
my
lips
and
onto
my
tongue
sudden
sweetness
hits
me
with
flavours
of
red
wine
plums
and
wild
berries
the
sweetness
is
quickly
followed
by
a
refreshing
dryness
brought
on
by
the
high
alcohol
content
both
the
sweet
and
the
bitter
mingle
and
dance
on
the
palette
in
perfect
unison
and
linger
into
a
long
dry
aftertaste
that
leaves
me
begging
for
more
the
low
carbonation
takes
the
edge
off
of
what
might
have
otherwise
been
a
sharp
and
bitter
dryness
and
makes
it
so
very
easy
to
drink
and
then
i
had
a
second
sip
was
it
worth
the
hype
and
hope
indeed
notes
this
beer
is
positively
phenomenal
even
without
the
hype
and
exclusivity
i
have
no
doubt
in
my
mind
that
i
could
easily
call
this
the
holy
grail
of
beers
this
beer
doesnt
need
the
hype
to
make
it
worldclass
it
speaks
well
enough
for
itself
is
this
the
best
i
dont
know
i
started
my
adventure
in
legality
about
one
year
ago
and
ive
already
enjoyed
what
is
commonly
regarded
as
the
greatest
beer
on
earth
no
matter
breweries
change
and
i
have
no
doubt
that
within
my
lifetime
w12
will
be
unseated
hopefully
for
the
better
in
the
meantime
ill
keep
on
coming
back
for
this
stuff
the
appearance
was
brown
with
a
crown
of
light
tan
head
which
would
cling
to
the
ridge
of
the
goblet
of
whomever
had
the
pleasure
of
enjoying
it
the
lady
was
taken
aback
by
the
complexity
of
the
aromas
contrasted
with
the
dank
odour
of
the
stone
corridors
in
the
bowels
of
the
monastery
the
flavour
was
rapturous
rich
complex
flavours
of
dark
fruits
the
yeast
lending
a
spicy
character
and
the
alcohol
rounding
out
the
drink
with
a
warmth
and
intensity
that
she
had
not
experienced
before
she
let
out
a
deep
sigh
she
could
die
content
now
as
she
held
in
her
hands
what
her
heart
had
so
longed
for
overall
one
of
the
best
belgians
i
have
had
though
it
does
not
top
much
others
by
far
drinkability
is
of
course
fanatstic
and
this
is
my
favorite
quad
the
best
beer
in
the
world
definitely
not
but
within
range
pours
a
nice
dark
brown
with
a
thick
tan
head
that
lasts
smells
of
banana
dark
fruits
slight
roastiness
and
caramelized
brown
sugar
taste
is
more
on
the
chocolatedark
roasty
malt
side
but
with
banana
and
brown
sugar
sweet
finish
with
noticeable
bitterness
and
next
to
no
alcohol
thick
velvety
body
with
lowmedium
carbonation
quite
drinkable
for
the
abv
stellar
fresh
preferred
fresh
damn
good
aged
best
beer
in
the
world
thats
a
debate
for
the
forums
on
beeradvocate
com
but
its
deﬁnitely
among
the
top
d
each
sip
unfolds
new
themes
and
flavors
like
any
good
work
of
art
ones
appreciation
deepens
as
you
delve
further
into
it
wonderful
this
is
the
best
beer
i
have
ever
tasted
and
i
am
genuinely
jealous
of
those
that
live
close
enough
to
go
to
the
brewery
and
partake
in
this
wonderful
beer
big
thanks
to
zaf88
for
this
trade
i
feel
blessed
to
have
tried
this
truly
unique
brew
drinkability
is
very
good
for
this
abv
while
not
a
session
beer
certainly
one
that
is
easy
to
drink
too
fast
because
of
its
ease
of
consumption
hv
pours
a
dark
cola
brown
but
with
minimal
head
smells
of
figs
carmel
brown
sugar
all
the
above
flavors
plus
cola
cinnamon
grape
raisin
and
i
dont
know
what
else
the
flavors
are
all
mild
in
fact
a
good
notch
milder
than
id
prefer
but
they
are
very
wellcombined
in
an
intriguing
package
i
kept
sipping
at
it
to
try
to
get
a
grip
on
the
elusive
flavor
a
great
beer
and
well
worth
trying
but
not
as
intense
as
some
other
quads
i
liked
the
st
b
a
bit
better
and
at
a
quarter
of
the
price
its
no
contest
this
is
a
wonderful
beer
it
achieves
a
balance
in
both
aroma
and
flavor
such
that
nothing
is
dominate
but
rather
achieves
a
complexity
that
keeps
you
looking
for
more
d
drinkability
is
good
the
high
abv
does
place
limits
on
how
many
of
these
that
should
be
consumed
at
once
there
is
really
nothing
bad
that
can
be
said
about
this
beer
it
excels
in
every
category
glad
i
got
the
chance
to
try
one
of
these
and
id
definitely
have
another
d
scores
just
shy
of
perfect
as
this
is
a
strong
sipper
complexity
in
this
beer
is
unmatched
and
the
balance
is
better
than
any
i
have
tried
it
seems
i
get
a
little
more
of
everythingthe
fruity
malty
yeasty
flavors
mixed
with
just
a
little
hops
at
the
end
cheers
i
guess
its
probably
sacrilege
to
say
this
but
this
wasnt
my
favorite
belgian
it
was
good
but
not
the
best
ive
ever
had
still
im
priveleged
to
have
gotten
the
opportunity
to
try
this
an
exquisite
and
marvelous
masterpiece
that
defines
the
beauty
of
beer
this
is
also
going
down
way
too
easy
im
hardly
detecting
the
alcohol
in
this
at
all
what
a
masterwork
deceivingly
rich
with
masterfully
crafted
character
its
very
difficult
to
say
how
drinkable
this
is
so
enjoyable
to
sip
while
i
certainly
want
more
i
found
it
very
satisfying
westvleteren
12
the
rosetta
stone
for
many
beer
drinkers
this
one
was
tasted
alongside
st
bernardus
12
and
rochefort
10
poured
in
to
an
ommegang
chalice
a
lovely
dark
rosewood
color
with
lighter
rosy
hues
at
the
bottom
of
the
glass
and
a
fluffy
tannishwhite
heading
that
clings
the
the
glass
and
has
great
retention
nose
can
only
be
described
as
extremely
deep
with
layers
of
prune
candy
licorice
caramel
more
sweet
dark
fruit
the
list
goes
on
and
on
taste
is
quite
breathtaking
and
complex
begins
very
rich
and
sweet
with
dark
fruit
such
as
plum
prune
and
date
chocolate
can
also
be
detected
lingering
in
the
background
somewhere
alcohol
also
lends
itself
perfectly
to
the
flavors
giving
it
the
perfect
amount
of
richness
and
depth
of
character
without
overdoing
it
the
end
of
the
beer
is
interesting
in
that
although
there
is
little
bitterness
in
initial
flavor
there
is
some
int
he
finish
that
one
might
describe
as
spicy
and
perhaps
a
bit
earthy
mouthfeel
is
the
most
exceptional
aspect
of
westy
12
in
that
it
is
just
so
damn
smooth
on
the
palate
it
was
a
sort
of
cask
conditioned
beer
character
to
it
yet
it
is
bottled
sometimes
i
think
cask
conditioning
beer
takes
a
bit
away
complexity
and
flavor
wise
but
with
this
one
there
is
not
much
left
to
be
desired
drinkability
is
very
very
high
despite
the
high
abv
although
i
dont
think
i
could
bring
myself
to
drinking
more
than
one
of
these
in
a
sitting
that
might
just
be
too
decadent
for
me
as
far
as
the
other
two
beers
i
am
sad
to
say
that
they
did
not
even
come
close
the
rochefort
was
a
bit
more
robust
and
boozy
whereas
the
st
bernardus
was
lighter
more
carbonated
and
quite
a
bit
spicier
ok
so
final
verdict
this
is
my
second
time
tasting
this
brew
and
the
first
time
i
was
less
than
impressed
this
tasting
on
the
other
hand
blew
me
away
i
now
have
no
problem
proclaiming
that
this
is
the
best
belgian
quad
and
one
of
the
best
beers
in
the
world
i
suspect
that
this
will
be
a
permanent
member
of
my
want
list
for
a
while
cheers
drinkability
this
beer
is
absolutely
incredible
not
quite
a
perfect
5
for
me
but
damn
close
i
feel
lucky
to
have
been
able
to
try
one
and
now
i
want
more
this
beer
carries
a
lot
of
expectations
and
while
it
wasnt
quite
a
perfect
beer
for
me
it
still
came
pretty
darn
close
the
look
smell
and
taste
of
this
are
outstanding
but
its
the
body
and
drinkibility
that
are
truly
world
class
being
rich
and
complex
but
still
immensely
smooth
and
quaffable
absolutely
worth
seeking
out
the
body
is
really
key
here
there
is
noticeable
body
here
but
finishes
dry
for
style
just
interesting
to
see
all
the
flavor
come
out
and
then
drop
out
with
a
lingering
flavor
overall
a
great
beer
loved
the
complexity
and
blend
overall
i
can
see
why
this
is
a
treat
for
so
many
very
warming
without
being
too
hot
this
could
probably
age
with
the
best
of
them
light
body
with
a
good
amount
of
carbonation
aids
in
drinkability
what
a
worldclass
beer
on
a
side
note
if
at
all
possible
wait
to
try
this
beer
until
you
are
able
to
make
the
pilgrimaged
out
to
the
monastery
in
belgium
the
surrounding
country
is
some
of
the
most
peaceful
and
quiet
farmland
ive
ever
seen
and
builds
up
the
experience
of
trying
the
beer
to
a
whole
new
level
this
is
only
my
second
time
ever
seeing
or
having
this
beer
what
struck
me
most
about
it
upon
a
second
try
was
the
predominance
of
chocolate
that
i
tasted
it
is
very
delicious
perhaps
a
little
boozy
once
it
starts
warming
up
but
a
very
very
tasty
beer
couple
around
since
it
is
a
top
five
brew
that
i
have
had
recomend
that
everyone
try
this
one
because
it
will
knock
your
socks
off
deep
mahogony
in
color
this
poured
a
thick
fluffy
beige
head
the
nose
gave
off
complex
scents
of
sweet
dark
fruit
raisins
dark
malt
chocolate
dipped
toffee
yeast
mineral
and
dark
caramel
in
the
mouth
it
was
mediumbodied
with
nice
concentration
yet
lightonitsfeet
due
to
the
abundance
of
carbonation
the
mouthfeel
is
soft
and
round
with
good
richness
in
the
midpalate
which
adds
some
drybitterness
on
the
finish
balance
is
the
key
work
here
and
it
has
that
in
spades
this
is
obviously
one
that
i
was
looking
forward
to
some
friends
from
belgium
and
i
used
the
opportunity
to
cook
some
game
and
drink
this
from
some
westvleteren
chalices
which
had
a
really
nice
shape
to
them
the
bottle
had
been
aged
5
years
when
we
poured
it
out
it
was
difficult
to
get
a
decent
head
on
it
my
friend
thought
perhaps
we
should
have
washed
the
glasses
a
bit
differently
the
smell
and
taste
were
rich
with
toffee
it
had
a
nice
sweetness
to
it
that
gave
way
to
some
warmth
from
the
alcohol
at
the
end
a
very
fine
beer
and
one
that
i
will
look
forward
to
trying
fresh
this
is
unique
as
all
trappists
are
is
it
better
not
necessarily
each
trappists
is
unique
and
to
be
appreciated
in
its
own
right
is
this
deserving
of
the
title
of
worlds
best
well
i
overheard
a
server
here
in
belgium
put
it
best
whatever
beer
you
like
then
that
is
a
good
beer
a
classic
the
classic
perhaps
and
rightfully
so
perfect
in
most
ways
a
beer
can
be
perfect
if
you
ever
are
lucky
enough
to
get
your
hands
on
one
of
these
well
ill
pay
you
for
it
thanks
again
to
jason
for
sharing
the
wealth
thanks
hoeferweisen
for
the
bottle
my
hats
of
to
the
monks
of
trappist
westvleteren
my
first
westy
12
dark
brown
with
a
cramy
tan
that
disappears
into
a
ring
huge
thanks
to
old
style
cub
fan
huge
and
beautiful
aroma
of
cherries
brown
sugar
raisins
figs
amazing
flavor
fresh
and
strong
yet
extremely
complex
has
a
strong
vineous
quality
finish
is
beautifully
smooth
and
sweet
theres
a
lot
going
on
in
this
beer
its
worthy
of
its
top
beer
titile
without
any
doubt
trappist
westvleteren
12
is
one
of
the
finest
beers
if
not
the
best
in
the
world
the
aroma
and
taste
of
this
outstanding
trappist
quadrupel
is
exceptional
and
extraordinary
to
say
the
least
it
ages
extremely
well
and
its
drinkability
is
truly
remarkable
smell
is
dark
fruits
belgian
candy
sugar
and
some
alcohol
taste
is
pretty
complex
and
quite
nice
more
of
the
dark
fruits
in
the
start
then
there
is
a
sense
of
spice
with
a
roasted
smokey
flavor
to
finish
velvety
smooth
on
the
mouthfeel
and
easy
drinking
just
enough
alcohol
to
notice
in
each
sip
excellent
brew
but
1
beer
in
the
world
id
have
to
say
this
beer
was
worth
the
money
and
worth
the
wait
it
certainly
lives
up
to
the
hype
at
gollem
amsterdam
12207
dark
brown
beige
head
lace
looks
perfect
in
its
own
chalice
very
elegant
my
first
impression
of
the
aroma
is
lots
of
yeast
very
bready
and
doughy
then
prunes
dates
and
pure
malt
not
overly
sweet
and
very
intricate
the
flavor
is
bready
as
well
plenty
of
spice
and
dried
fruit
but
not
sugary
and
surprisingly
not
as
sweet
as
the
other
abts
ive
had
no
alcohol
flavor
the
palate
is
very
smooth
and
full
almost
perfect
goes
down
cleanly
with
a
finish
that
leaves
a
pleasant
but
not
overly
sweet
taste
in
your
mouth
for
quite
a
while
i
knew
that
they
would
have
this
when
i
was
planning
my
trip
to
amsterdam
but
i
was
almost
in
disbelief
until
i
actually
ordered
it
and
forked
over
the
twelve
euros
it
was
served
out
of
the
cellar
like
the
st
bernardus
12
that
i
had
the
nigh
before
and
that
temperature
perfectly
complimented
its
flavors
as
the
last
of
the
top
three
abts
to
have
rated
in
comparison
i
would
say
that
westy
is
by
far
the
most
drinkable
and
balanced
i
think
that
rochefort
has
more
complexities
in
the
aroma
which
i
really
like
but
it
can
be
too
rich
and
alcoholic
st
bernardus
is
about
the
same
in
intensity
as
westy
but
lacks
the
powerful
yeastiness
and
complexity
of
flavor
price
wise
is
it
three
times
better
than
st
bernardus
no
way
and
i
know
ill
be
lucky
to
get
another
one
any
time
soon
which
i
guess
is
part
of
the
mystique
aroma
starts
off
with
some
vanilla
and
slight
chocolate
but
really
comes
to
live
as
the
brew
warms
bananas
plums
lots
of
malty
goodness
taste
is
caramel
dried
fruit
some
alcohol
as
she
warms
medium
mouthfeel
with
a
bit
of
stickeyness
nice
carbonation
definately
worthy
of
the
hype
amazing
i
could
drink
this
beer
forever
and
i
dont
think
im
being
biased
by
the
hype
drinks
pretty
good
for
the
abv
complexity
maybe
a
touch
hot
alcoholwise
but
in
line
with
the
style
a
super
quad
this
is
the
best
quad
ive
had
the
flavor
aromatics
are
superior
for
the
style
i
could
happily
stock
this
in
my
cellar
but
i
am
just
as
happy
with
st
benardus
abt
12
pannepot
sic
now
to
go
get
those
other
50
or
so
top
100
beers
i
must
try
before
i
die
d
notes
an
excellent
beer
and
unfortunate
to
only
have
one
bottle
it
drinks
incredibly
smooth
and
soft
with
an
excellent
sense
of
satisfaction
after
a
glass
it
has
certainly
secured
a
place
among
the
best
of
the
best
and
well
worth
seeking
out
to
try
almost
frighteningly
drinkable
and
perhaps
the
closest
thing
to
perfection
that
i
have
had
the
opportunity
to
taste
i
enjoy
this
beer
get
it
it
will
last
forever
the
legendary
westy
lives
up
to
its
reputation
its
a
bit
sad
to
think
i
wont
be
able
to
try
this
one
again
for
some
time
but
good
old
st
bernardus
can
keep
me
company
in
the
meantime
reviewing
the
beer
long
rated
1
here
brings
mixed
feelings
certainly
it
is
an
excellent
beer
but
i
also
believe
there
are
some
better
ones
out
there
and
my
scores
on
this
and
those
beers
reflect
that
then
again
its
all
about
individual
tastes
and
how
they
reflect
on
a
common
scoring
system
any
true
conniseur
knows
there
really
is
no
1
there
is
a
grouping
of
world
class
beers
and
this
one
belongs
in
the
upper
echelons
of
that
group
nuff
said
md
creamy
almost
chewy
and
full
bodied
the
only
thing
keeping
it
from
beeing
a
5
0
for
drinkability
is
the
alcohol
content
wow
so
this
is
it
the
best
beer
in
the
world
what
do
i
think
well
no
doubt
its
good
damn
good
worthy
of
many
of
its
accolades
personally
i
wouldnt
crown
it
the
best
beer
in
the
world
honestly
its
perhaps
only
slightly
better
than
other
quads
held
in
very
high
regard
i
mean
very
slightly
that
being
said
i
think
a
slight
beefing
up
in
the
aroma
and
a
bump
in
the
spice
flavor
would
be
a
slight
improvement
but
those
are
very
minor
criticisms
this
is
damn
fine
beer
that
every
ba
should
have
the
privilege
of
trying
pours
a
deep
ruby
color
with
a
stingy
brownish
head
it
looks
beautiful
in
the
chalice
the
smell
hits
you
out
of
the
bottle
grapes
sweet
malt
some
alcohol
aroma
the
taste
is
absolutely
magical
i
was
worried
that
it
might
be
an
overrated
beer
and
that
its
exclusivity
breeds
its
higher
ratings
but
it
really
is
an
amazing
beer
i
wish
the
monks
would
use
this
great
gift
of
brewing
to
a
more
expansive
level
the
mouthfeel
is
wonderful
i
love
thickersyrupy
beers
and
this
one
has
a
wonderul
thick
mouthfeel
and
i
could
drink
it
every
day
all
day
long
for
the
rest
of
my
life
but
i
may
never
have
this
beer
again
i
have
to
make
sure
to
take
my
time
enjoying
every
drop
of
this
beer
it
is
a
real
treat
drinkability
is
moderate
to
high
the
incredible
flavors
are
easy
to
consume
and
beer
is
very
smooth
the
alcohol
is
hidden
very
well
too
however
the
high
alcohol
limit
consumption
of
tihs
beer
all
the
same
if
i
could
drink
this
beer
with
no
consequences
then
i
would
probably
do
it
all
day
long
a
true
work
of
art
and
a
pleasure
although
i
dont
think
ill
ever
end
my
quest
for
the
perfect
beer
this
has
taken
me
several
steps
closer
overall
i
was
very
pleasantly
surprised
that
the
hype
for
this
beer
is
all
true
this
is
the
real
deal
from
top
to
bottom
this
is
just
excellent
amazing
balance
complexity
and
smoothness
i
dont
know
if
it
is
the
best
beer
in
the
world
but
it
is
truly
outstanding
d
high
drinkability
very
tasty
and
warming
a
great
choice
for
a
relaxing
beer
in
the
evening
this
beer
pours
dark
chestnut
with
a
very
tightly
knit
head
that
soon
settles
to
a
thin
ring
and
leaves
some
spotty
lacing
the
clarity
is
better
on
this
beer
than
the
rochefort
but
the
head
is
not
as
magnificent
beautifully
balanced
malt
aromas
with
quite
a
bit
of
dark
fruit
and
a
hint
of
spun
sugar
the
taste
is
exceptional
with
beautifuly
balanced
sweet
malt
dark
fruit
and
spicy
hops
the
mouthfeel
is
slightly
heavy
maybe
a
bit
more
so
than
the
rochefort
and
has
a
tannic
edge
to
it
rather
than
being
super
creamy
regardless
this
is
a
pleasure
to
drink
and
parse
its
flavors
and
if
i
had
another
one
id
crack
it
right
now
i
tried
to
be
skeptical
but
this
truly
is
divine
beer
i
had
this
back
to
back
with
the
st
bernardus
12
but
theres
not
much
comparison
the
bernardus
is
lighter
in
color
and
thus
has
more
fruity
flavors
than
chocolate
i
love
bernardus
but
if
westy
12s
were
just
as
available
itd
be
my
goto
awesome
beer
i
wish
it
wasnt
so
hard
to
come
by
as
i
would
certainly
have
it
on
hand
regularly
great
treat
though
is
it
the
best
in
the
world
for
me
so
far
it
has
been
one
of
my
favorites
overall
this
was
a
great
beer
did
it
live
up
to
the
hypecould
it
live
up
to
the
hype
hard
to
say
i
would
love
to
have
another
full
glass
rather
than
the
portion
i
had
in
order
to
really
savor
and
explore
this
beer
but
i
cant
say
that
i
was
dissappointed
either
because
what
i
did
get
to
sample
was
awesome
d
overall
this
was
a
good
and
easy
drinking
especially
for
10
abv
it
was
a
great
drinker
but
i
dont
know
if
it
was
the
hype
or
what
but
i
wasnt
super
impressed
this
is
a
good
beer
that
really
stands
out
because
it
has
so
much
flavor
that
is
all
so
balanced
nothing
really
pops
out
and
it
is
not
what
id
consider
a
wow
flavor
beer
but
it
has
so
much
complexity
in
such
a
package
cant
wait
to
get
another
one
if
i
can
d
like
the
8
this
is
an
incredibly
drinkable
no
hint
of
the
abv
at
all
some
of
the
hyped
beers
let
you
down
but
this
one
does
not
makes
me
wish
i
would
i
lived
in
belgium
drink
this
one
if
you
can
d
oye
amazingly
good
this
really
lived
up
to
the
hype
i
dont
really
know
what
more
i
could
say
that
hasnt
been
said
by
other
reviewers

thats
not

i
think
this
is
an
excellent
beer
i
dont
think
its
worth
the
price
to
buy
it
all
the
time
but
its
definitely
worth
it
to
get
a
couple
bottles
just
to
try
it
because
its
not
easy
to
get
i
wasnt
disappointed
thats
for
sure
vinous
with
a
slightly
roasted

quality
overall
makes
for
a
sublime

experience
i
simply
didnt
want
to
see
the

this
stuff
i
sipped
slowly
and
it
still
disapeared
quicker

i
had
wanted
this
is
a
masterpiece

ive
been
bamboozled

get
a

right
off

with

around

i
swear
i
feel
taste
buds
going
crazy
on
the
roof
of
my
mouth
even
vanilla
clove
bready
flavors
are
abundant
i
want
to
savor
this
beer
but
it
really
is
too
good
and
too
easy
to
drink
good
thing
i
have
3
more
i
wouldnt
put
this
one
necessarily
above
some
other
trappist
beers
that
ive
had
but
the
accessibility
makes
this
the
rare
treat
the
mere
fact
that
the
quanities
and
availability
are
limited
makes
me
not
at
all
surprised
this
is
the
ba
favorite

meant
for

good

regardless
but
at
12
a
bottle
it
is
unlikely
that
ill
be
getting
this
very
often
i
would
echo
the
sentiments
that
this
is
not
the
best
beer
in
the
world
but
that
is
quite
an
expectation
to
live
up
to
drinkability
drinkable
beer
moreso
than
other
strong
belgium
beers
i
have
tried
great
beer
but
it
is
not
the
best
in
the
world
had
the
honor
of
sampling
this
popular
item
the
other
night
as
i
was
guided
through
my
first
beer
brewing
experience
by
a
very
generous
friend
who
shared
his
last
bottle
of
this
liquid
gold
poured
a
rich
chestnutbrown
wrubyamber
edges
where
light
permeated
through
head
thin
and
light
beige
the
aroma
was
complex
but
dominated
by
chocolate
character
and
various
toasted
malts
with
lighter
scents
of
a
bouquet
of
spices
and
light
herbs
light
esters
and
warming
alcohol
the
taste
was
exceptionalchocolate
malt
molasses
and
candy
sugar
an
exotic
blend
of
rich
spices
and
a
strong
finish
of
cocoa
and
alcohol
rounded
out
by
bitter
hops
there
was
also
an
inexplicable
bite
at
the
back
of
the
midpalate
that
was
actually
quite
pleasant
but
i
dont
know
what
it
was
very
light
carbonation
rich
body
that
consistently
delivers
throughout
the
palate
and
harmonious
balance
between
a
very
dry
texture
and
the
sweet
and
spice
flavors
forge
a
powerful
result
is
this
a
world
class
beer
absolutely
is
it
the
best
thing
ive
ever
tasted
i
certainly
enjoyed
it
a
great
deal
but
im
afraid
the
answer
is
no
there
are
other
things
more
pleasing
to
my
palate
but
who
cares
about
the
hype
its
a
lovely
drink
and
im
pleased
as
punch
or
i
guess
pleased
as
really
good
beer
to
be
drinking
it

to

ago
bananas
dark
fruits
dominate
taste
is
more
wine
like
detecting
less
of
the
banana
yeast
notes
and
getting
more
hints
of
red
wine
and
hints
of
chocolate
it
is
sweeter
but
definitely
not
cloying
the
mouthfeel
is
still
velvety
smooth
and
still
perfectly
drinkable
no
alcohol
detected
if
you
see
this
available
where
you
are
grab
it
without
hesitation
i
recommend
going
to
belgium
though
and
experiencing
it
in
its
homeland
plus
theres
about
1000
other
breweries
to
try
beers
from
over
there
d
i
am
convinced
i
could
drink
a
case
of
this
beer
and
notice
something
new
with
each
bottle
a
joy
to
drink
i
am
not
the
biggest
quad
guy
more
a
function
of
income
than
preference
but
despite
my
naivete
i
cant
help
but
notice
the
excellence
of
this
brew
never
have
i
had
the
pleasure
of
a
beer
with
half
as
much
complexity
this
beer
receives
a
lot
of
love
on
this
site
this
review
will
not
alter
that
trend
it
is
a
tremendous
offering
the
definition
of
what
a
quad
should
be
oh
yeah
and
at
10
2
it
sure
goes
down
easy
flavor
is
rich
and
so
smooth
and
unified
alcohol
is
almost
completely
concealed
a
wonderfully
tasty
treat
overall
this
is
an
outstanding
beer
i
have
drank
it
on
several
occasions
with
some
other
world
class
beers
to
compare
it
to
i
have
a
tough
time
saying
its
the
best
beer
i
have
ever
had
but
have
just
as
difficult
time
saying
it
isnt
i
think
it
deserves
a
perfect
score
i
cant
imagine
a
single
thing
here
you
could
improve
on
d
i
could
go
on
and
on
about
this
beer
i
had
really
high
expectations
for
it
how
could
you
not
and
it
completely
delivered
to
my
surprise
it
exceeded
my
expectations
suffice
to
say
i
will
constantly
be
looking
to
get
my
hands
on
more
of
these
this
is
the
best
beer
i
have
ever
had
hands
down
it
lived
up
to
its
reputation
as
worlds
greatest
i
have
a
few
more
cellared
but
will
save
them
until
a
special
occasion
it
was
truly
an
honor
to
drink
this
beer
da
true
brain
teaser
of
a
beer
will
challange
the
most
adept
beer
taster
not
my
ideal
beer
but
it
is
so
flavourful
and
interesting
that
alone
makes
it
very
good
nice
white
stabile
head
dark
brown
colour
lower
carbonation
aromas
of
fruits
cherry
buttery
malts
very
sweet
smelling
overall
flavours
of
sweet
bread
smooth
malts
dried
fruits
raisins
and
roasted
elements
all
perfectly
balanced
full
bodied
with
an
oily
texture
finished
crisp
with
some
bitterness
and
sweetness
in
the
aftertaste
highly
recommended
and
exceptionally
enjoyable
really
a
solid
wonderful
beer
and
it
didnt
disappoint
i
tasted
this
together
with
st
bernardus
abt
12
and
though
similar
it
beat
it
hands
down
d
i
wanted
to
dislike
this
beer
i
really
really
did
i
told
myself
i
would
rate
it
like
any
other
and
try
to
play
down
the
hype
but
it
just
didnt
work
the
only
way
i
can
describe
how
good
this
one
goes
down
is
the
spicy
warming
sharpness
of
the
finish
of
a
good
big
red
wine
because
of
the
price
i
wont
actively
seek
this
one
out
again
but
if
im
ever
in
europe
and
i
see
one
you
can
bet
thats
what
ill
be
drinking
i
usually
dislike
quads
but
this
one
seemed
so
laid
back
it
was
a
delight
bottle
pours
a
cloudy
purplishbrown
color
with
a
thick
almond
head
strong
lacing
aroma
is
fruity
raisins
perhaps
with
a
nice
bit
of
the
belgian
yeast
to
it
mouthfeel
is
smooth
and
full
flavor
is
very
complex
its
hard
to
put
a
finger
on
it
theres
some
caramel
apricot
alcohol
and
some
toffee
to
it
maybe
not
the
best
beer
ive
ever
had
but
its
right
up
there
i
think
it
is
hard
to
give
a
beer
a
5
on
this
when
you
could
only
handle
drinking
one
or
two
at
a
time
in
one
night
this
is
for
sure
the
best
quadrupel
ever
but
my
heart
still
remains
a
hophead
i
thank
the
beer
gods
for
this
chance
to
try
this
outstanding
brew
and
thanks
to
zack
for
sharing
this
beer
with
me
thick
and
silky
but
very
drinkable
perfect
carbonation
this
is
a
fantastic
example
of
the
style
and
one
of
the
best
beers
made
this
is
everything
its
advertised
to
be
d
i
dont
typically
like
belgians
too
much
but
the
8
and
12
are
definitely
worthy
i
wont
call
this
my
favorite
beer
but
id
never
argue
with
someone
for
saying
its
theirs
st
bernardus
abt
12
or
trappist
achel
extra
d
what
a
wonderful
sipper
goes
down
easily
and
one
could
get
carried
away
with
this
if
not
careful
this
beer
surpassed
any
expectations
i
had
high
as
they
were
the
discussions
about
the
beer
started
strong
but
in
the
end
we
were
simply
too
distracted
by
the
deliciousness
of
this
beverage
to
talk
finished
it
pretty
quickly
as
each
tasted
prompted
another
had
there
been
another
bottle
in
our
refrigerator
im
sure
it
would
not
be
there
this
morning
it
may
be
time
to
start
planning
that
trip
to
visit
the
monks
dwell
what
can
you
say
it
is
westvletaren
unfortunately
you
are
about
as
likely
to
win
the
lottery
than
to
have
this
beer
at
your
disposal
450
a
case
that
makes
it
pretty
tough
if
i
could
have
this
beer
regularly
i
would
though
i
have
to
say
it
will
definitely
hit
you
with
its
whopping
abv
a
question
any
belgian
fan
needs
to
ask
is
how
does
this
brew
compare
to
its
most
celebrated
cousins
rochefort
10
and
st
bernardus
abt
12
it
holds
up
quite
nicely
know
this
this
is
the
best
beer
in
the
world
hands
down
i
dont
know
what
is
more
depressing
that
the
pats
will
likely
win
today
or
that
my
goblet
is
almost
gone
this
is
perfection
west
12
trumps
any
belgian
i
have
ever
had
honored
to
be
one
of
the
rare
few
who
has
had
the
opportunity
to
have
it
pass
through
my
lips
got
5
more
bottles
so
im
dying
to
see
what
will
await
me
in
two
to
three
years
when
i
open
the
next
bottle
i
can
only
imagine
the
taste
after
its
been
cellared
a
few
years
thanks
maxskip
update
oh
god
this
stuff
is
so
good
i
am
praying
for
forgiveness
as
i
buy
all
i
can
get
this
beer
was
everything
people
have
said
it
would
be
tasted
much
like
other
trappist
beers
but
more
well
rounded
and
smooth
pours
a
brownamber
color
with
slight
haze
and
ruby
highlights
the
nose
is
very
fruity
with
some
sour
tones
maybe
cherry
and
some
spice
smell
almost
champagnish
slightly
kindof
maybe
a
little
nice
whiteoff
white
head
dissipates
fairly
fast
wow
intense
dark
fruit
flavors
plums
raisins
figs
dates
black
cherry
wowwwowowowow
awesome
spice
and
smoothness
damn
smooth
i
see
what
all
the
hype
is
about
this
beer
is
great
the
finish
is
smooth
as
hell
and
the
mouthfeel
is
bomb
drinkability
is
very
dangerous
as
the
alcohol
on
the
finish
is
about
as
minimal
as
you
can
get
with
a
quad
but
still
a
great
warming
effect
in
the
stomach
awesome
beer
get
it
if
you
can
props
to
the
monks
overall
from
the
look
to
the
smell
to
the
taste
to
the
feel
just
a
bad
ass
beer
i
see
what
the
fuss
is
about
and
i
am
glad
to
try
it
and
also
glad
to
try
more
i
feel
that
this
particular
beer
is
a
little
young
and
will
only
get
better
with
age
overall
this
was
a
great
beer
and
surely
one
of
the
best
on
the
planet
i
dont
think
i
would
even
call
it
my
favorite
and
if
i
never
get
to
try
another
again
im
glad
i
got
one
shot
and
giving
it
a
try
d
this
beer
could
be
paired
with
anything
or
be
enjoyed
as
an
apperatif
this
is
an
incredibly
versatile
beer
my
only
regret
is
not
cellaring
it
for
longer
ive
been
waiting
to
review
this
beer
for
a
while
2
years
since
my
first
notes
ive
tried
3
bottles
from
3
locations
i
guess
i
just
dont
like
this
beer
as
much
as
a
lot
of
other
beers
d
will
i
find
myself
craving
this
beer
at
many
different
occasions
yes
however
some
points
taken
off
due
to
its
rarity
and
inability
to
be
a
session
beer
d
i
like
this
beer
a
lot
i
obviously
wont
be
having
it
often
but
i
am
happy
to
have
the
chance
to
try
it
this
was
the
last
beer
of
a
trappist
tasting
so
my
notes
were
light
even
though
this
was
great
thanks
again
to
aaron
for
letting
me
try
this
brew
one
of
the
few
top
100
that
i
havent
thought
was
overrated
now
to
try
and
find
a
westy
8
to
try
what
a
wonderful
beer
this
is
superbly
drinkable
im
glad
i
have
a
few
more
of
these
laying
around
i
may
if
pressed
have
some
that
are
more
favorite
the
only
thing
that
keeps
me
from
buying
this
all
the
time
is
the
price
10
for
one
bottle
is
not
a
frequent
visitor
to
my
shelf
overall
a
great
beer
not
sure
if
worth
the
hype
but
certainly
great
its
likely
due
to
my
lack
of
beer
tasting
experience
it
actually
got
me
a
little
lightheaded
yes
tastes
of
dark
fruit
with
a
series
malt
backbone
without
being
cloying
it
poured
a
dark
brown
with
a
light
tan
head
cant
wait
to
try
again
this
beer
poured
a
dark
brown
with
some
amber
hues
the
head
was
tan
with
very
nice
lacing
the
aroma
is
caramel
with
belgian
candy
noticeable
alcohol
is
also
perceptible
the
taste
is
heavily
malty
with
caramel
and
candy
notes
quite
evident
the
mouthfeel
is
full
with
a
carbonation
bite
on
the
tongue

very
delightful
this
is
a
compelling
beer
that
is
quite
elegant
yummy
taste
spicy
cinnamon
and
heavy
raison
flavor
very
complex
taste
progression
subtler
on
the
caramel
than
the
nose
implies
which
i
appreciated
shockingly
smooth
for
such
a
rich
fullbodied
beer
just
a
tinge
of
fusels
this
beer
is
like
a
grandfather
it
has
an
important
message
to
impart
and
is
full
of
wisdom
but
you
have
to
be
listening
closely
and
selflessly
the
brothers
truly
put
a
lot
of
love
into
this
beer
i
dont
believe
despite
the
brilliance
of
this
beer
that
everyone
would
really
get
the
point
but
those
who
do
are
blessed
a
gem
the
beer
poured
a
deep
brown
almost
black
color
with
a
medium
thickness
tan
head
that
lasted
for
a
few
minutes
and
gave
way
to
nice
ring
around
the
end
but
the
lacing
doesnt
hold
up
well
the
nose
is
pretty
damn
imressive
there
are
some
fruit
notes
dates
plums
and
a
nice
chocolately
character
the
taste
is
very
impressive
as
well
the
malty
chocolate
notes
are
the
first
thing
that
takes
my
taste
buds
on
a
ride
along
with
some
of
the
deep
fruit
notes
i
got
in
the
aroma
as
well
the
carbonation
is
rather
full
and
overall
makes
for
a
full
bodied
beer
i
could
not
say
for
sure
whether
this
is
the
best
beer
in
the
world
but
it
is
a
pretty
damn
good
beer
and
well
worth
a
try
if
you
can
get
it
for
a
reasonable
price
overall
i
prefer
st
bernardus
12
over
this
beer
the
slightly
thicker
mouthfeel
gives
this
beer
slightly
less
drinkability
than
sb12
ive
been
waiting
all
day
to
drink
this
beer
but
waited
until
the
snowball
fights
with
my
daughter
and
cocoa
and
shoveling
were
done
it
was
well
worth
the
wait
and
as
hard
as
it
is
to
get
it
will
be
worth
the
wait
until
my
next
westvleteren
12
but
believe
me
there
will
be
a
next
one
i
think
the
rarity
of
this
artifically
heightens
its
overall
score
as
far
as
the
talk
and
excitement
about
the
beer
westy
12
is
worth
it
but
i
would
not
pay
forty
dollars
a
bottle
for
it
at
a
bar
but
twenty
bucks
or
so
seems
okay
to
spend
from
time
to
time
i
highly
recommend
it
even
if
you
have
to
go
through
the
hassle
of
getting
from
someone
in
belgium
because
otherwise
people
are
going
to
have
some
from
trades
or
vacations
where
they
brought
some
of
this
back
it
is
definitely
a
rare
and
highly
demanded
beer
yes
this
one
was
noticeably
better
than
st
bernardus
12
in
my
opinion
i
am
happy
i
got
to
try
such
a
great
beer
and
hope
all
of
you
some
time
soon
overall
a
good
cold
evening
or
desert
beer
yeah
its
pricey
but
id
go
for
another
thanks
eclectic
for
this
via
trade
not
too
long
ago
in
my
haul
from
crackedkettles
online
beer
sales
i
have
a
westvleteren
12
from
1998
and
the
date
on
the
cap
is
for
the
year
2001
i
am
not
sure
if
it
shld
be
1997
instead
so
i
had
a
contemporary
westy
12
2
days
ago
and
i
clearly
recall
the
taste
as
well
as
the
full
experience
and
gratification
level
lets
see
how
this
one
does
it
is
interesting
to
note
that
in
1998
when
i
was
in
middle
school
westvleteren
12
is
11
abv
as
opposed
to
the
10
2
abv
that
it
is
today
it
was
also
10
6
abv
at
a
certain
point
in
time
man
this
baby
is
crowned
tight
it
took
some
effort
to
get
it
off
and
immediately
a
vinous
grassy
aroma
can
be
can
be
detected
at
the
opening
of
the
bottle
some
dark
fruits
but
not
really
impressive
here
i
poured
it
out
into
my
old
abdij
st
sixtus
oversized
wine
glass
and
a
one
finger
thick
head
developed
over
a
dark
amber
brown
liquid
below
what
surprised
me
was
the
way
this
head
grew
to
a
2
finger
thick
head
which
persisted
for
a
while
the
head
was
creamy
and
bubbly
but
more
bubbly
and
i
prefered
the
creamier
head
on
the
contemporary
westvleteren
the
smell
was
not
very
strong
but
the
vinous
part
of
it
was
clear
there
was
this
light
yeasty
bready
smell
with
a
little
bit
of
fruits
underneath
and
i
think
i
sense
a
dash
of
malts
but
in
general
the
smell
was
not
fantastic
moving
on
to
the
taste
the
nuttyalmondy
goodness
from
the
contemporary
westy
was
still
present
though
the
intensity
probably
halved
other
than
the
nutty
entry
there
was
a
well
pronounced
vinous
taste
of
aged
beers
that
was
well
within
expectation
along
with
the
a
nice
maltiness
which
followed
behind
sweetness
was
clear
but
it
was
not
a
thick
sweetness
like
in
the
contemporary
westvleteren
it
became
a
more
mellow
sweetness
the
fruitiness
was
also
more
subtle
and
mellow
on
this
one
i
can
raisins
grapes
and
some
plums
which
were
kind
of
buried
under
the
malts
but
stil
detectable
along
with
the
sweetness
the
finish
was
a
pleasant
nuttyalmondy
dryness
with
nice
vinous
aromas
maltiness
and
plums
on
the
nose
the
maltiness
and
the
fruitiness
towards
the
finish
was
a
very
pleasant
part
of
the
taste
that
somewhat
reminds
me
of
the
greatly
aged
19851988
la
trappe
dubbel
that
i
had
which
was
so
called
one
of
the
best
aged
beer
i
ever
had
thus
far
up
there
with
the
special
6
on
the
whole
i
still
prefer
the
taste
of
the
contemporary
westvleteren
though
i
prefer
this
ones
finish
it
was
clearly
a
very
much
mellowed
down
taste
which
had
its
unique
strengths
the
after
taste
was
flooded
with
malts
brown
sugar
sweetness
and
dark
fruits
starting
with
plums
and
moving
on
to
raisins
and
grapes
after
a
while
the
mouthfeel
on
this
was
about
medium
bodied
clearly
the
aging
compromises
on
the
thickness
and
the
creaminess
as
well
it
was
still
slightly
creamy
to
drink
and
the
carbonation
was
clearly
going
low
but
still
pretty
sufficient
11
abv
seems
deceivingly
smooth
and
light
and
i
almost
thought
this
was
a
7
or
8
abv
if
i
did
not
know
from
the
start
that
it
is
11
abv
again
i
prefer
the
mouthfeel
of
the
contemporary
westvleteren
12
lets
now
break
things
down
further
the
smell
was
largey
vinous
aromas
which
was
obviously
different
from
the
contemporarys
intensely
fruity
and
sweet
smell
taste
was
a
classic
mellowed
down
version
which
was
generally
not
as
good
except
for
the
slightly
prefinish
and
finish
which
was
in
a
greatness
realm
of
its
own
mouthfeel
lost
thickness
richness
and
creaminess
as
well
as
some
carbonation
over
time
but
surprisingly
the
nuttiness
was
still
there
very
nice
and
i
can
really
appreciate
it
but
i
still
prefer
the
contemporary
westy
to
this
particular
bottle
of
1998
vintage
i
mean
aging
really
produces
different
results
we
all
know
that
cheers
for
the
season
folks
ok
i
am
v
slightly
intoxicated
maybe
it
is
my
lethargy
and
lack
of
food
and

i
believe
not
my
favorite
beer
but
its
up
there
this
is
one
tasty
brew
but
ya
know
what
the
price
is
too
high
unless
youre
in
belgium
drinking
from
the
local
café
but
this
is
to
be
experienced
in
your
lifetime
huge
thanks
go
to
tpd975
for
getting
me
this
bottle
murky
ruddy
brown
color
this
has
lost
some
carbonation
but
it
looks
decent
very
fruitforward
nose
with
fairly
pleasant
oxidation
smells
decent
palate
is
very
oxidized
a
little
cardboardy
earthy
fruit
is
also
prevalent
carbonation
is
a
bit
low
at
this
point
pretty
good
but
id
take
a
fresh
bottle
over
this
this
beer
has
been
hyped
as
much
as
obamaclinton
but
when
you
drink
it
you
realize
that
its
just
a
beer
a
very
good
beer
but
just
a
beer
it
has
been
a
great
experience
in
reviewing
all
three
westvleterens
within
24
hrs
although
it
is
a
very
good
beer
rochefort
10
is
just
as
good
easier
to
get
and
more
economical
plain
and
simple
overall
this
is
one
of
the
best
quads
i
have
ever
had
i
did
this
as
a
side
by
side
with
the
rochfort
10
and
prefered
the
westy
that
said
i
can
get
a
rochefort
all
the
time
westy
is
much
more
difficult
yes
there
is
a
bit
of
hype
to
this
beer
but
it
is
a
great
for
a
reason
overall
the
drinkability
was
not
bad
probabiy
wont
be
seeking
it
out
again
worth
a
try
cheers
tastes
like
heaven
will
if
i
make
it
the
alcohol
is
almost
completely
hidden
has
notes
of
raisins
plums
sweet
malt
spices
and
yeast
no
wonder
this
is
rated
so
highly
believe
the
hype
notes
i
am
very
happy
that
my
stash
has
not
been
tarnished
by
my
lessthan
ideal
storage
conditions
compared
to
the
many
that
i
drank
last
year
in
belgium
the
beer
has
retained
many
of
its
great
characteristics
while
mellowing
out
in
the
alcohol
slightly
i
would
say
that
it
has
lived
up
to
the
hype
that
is
associated
with
it
this
is
for
a
damn
good
reason
i
hope
this
beer
always
maintains
the
quality
and
doesnt
sacrifice
this
for
quantity
proost
review
translated
from
french
111508
okay
im
retired
no
more
beers
for
me
whats
the
point
bottom
line
yeah
i
spent
a
few
bucks
to
get
my
bottles
of
westvletern
12and
8
and
i
could
have
bought
lots
of
other
beers
for
the
cost
but
i
feel
that
the
money
was
spent
well
ive
had
other
quadrupels
before
and
i
liked
them
im
partial
to
the
style
is
this
the
best
example
of
the
style
that
ive
had
to
date
you
darn
tootin
is
it
because
of
the
scarcity
factor
no
its
because
my
palate
tells
me
that
it
is
that
damn
good
complexity
in
the
taste
this
has
it
complexity
that
has
all
the
flavours
working
in
harmony
this
has
it
a
great
looking
appearance
in
a
glass
this
has
it
a
nose
that
keeps
you
sniffing
before
every
sip
this
has
it
a
mouthfeel
that
is
both
silky
smooth
and
chewy
at
the
same
time
this
comes
very
close
drinkability
that
goes
through
the
roof
just
about
so
would
i
buy
some
again
at
current
pricesus18
per
bottle
plus
shipping
from
belgium
maybe
but
if
it
was
as
easily
available
as
other
examples
of
the
style
id
buy
it
by
the
case
expensive
but
a
must
i
could
make
a
decent
session
of
this
beer
heavily
vinous
and
clearly
a
topnotch
beer
i
would
definitely
pay
a
crazy
price
for
another
bottle
theres
more
here
than
just
one
tasting
can
reveal
overall
this
finished
behind
the
rochefort
10
and
slightly
above
the
abt
12
and
chimay
blue
another
truely
a
worldclass
beer
as
were
the
others
im
not
sure
if
its
worth
20
if
you
dont
get
it
in
belgium
due
beers
of
similar
quality
being
available
more
readily
and
for
much
cheaper
definitely
a
beer
you
have
to
try
though
11

stamped
on
the
cap
ive
had
these
for
a
year
or
so
as
part
of
a
wonderful
gift
from
a
12
pack
given
to
me
poured
at
55f
into
my
westvleteren
chalice
strong
tan
head
decent
retention
solid
lacing
nose
has
notes
of
rasin
figs
and
dates
perhaps
plum
mouthfeel
is
silky
and
spicy
taste
is
similar
to
the
nose
just
more
apparent
in
the
depths
of
a
profound
flavor
this
is
sure
making
my
tuesday
night
something
special
truly
one
of
the
worlds
best
offerings
for
a
commercial
beer
although
im
not
sure
this
is
the
epitiome
of
a
commercial
offering
as
far
as
drinkability
goes
should
we
even
discuss
this
this
beer
is
closest
to
the
st
bernardus
abt
12
but
is
much
cleaner
deeper
and
pure
truly
the
best
quadrupel
offering
by
a
long
shot
id
offer
a
longer
diatribe
about
the
complexities
and
beauty
of
this
beer
but
if
you
dont
get
it
already
there
is
nothing
my
words
can
do
this
is
one
big
complex
beer
that
really
needs
time
to
be
consumed
it
is
always
fun
to
experience
the
change
temperature
can
make
in
a
these
type
of
beers
if
you
ever
have
the
pleasure
of
drinking
this
do
not
make
the
mistake
of
drinking
it
too
fast
or
too
cold
it
must
be
consumed
slowly
to
let
it
warm
up
and
express
its
full
potential
great
for
the
style
and
a
pleasure
to
drink
drinkability
im
glad
i
finally
had
a
chance
to
try
this
but
to
be
honest
i
prefer
the
rochefort
10
this
one
is
just
a
bit
too
boozy
for
my
taste
id
love
the
chance
to
try
one
thats
aged
a
bit
pours
a
dark
chesnut
brown
with
a
frothy
thin
offwhite
head
that
dies
down
to
a
mystical
layer
that
floats
on
top
the
entire
time
lacing
is
spotty
all
over
the
sides
of
the
glass
smell
is
so
complex
combination
of
yeasty
goodness
dark
fruits
fig
cherry
raisin
dates
plum
sweet
caramel
malt
sugary
vanilla
thick
honey
and
fresh
flowers
i
cant
think
of
a
single
beer
that
even
compares
to
this
one
in
terms
of
smell
taste
starts
off
with
a
bready
yeast
which
is
then
bitch
slapped
by
a
whole
lot
of
sweet
goodness
almost
tastes
like
a
caramel
apple
to
me
as
lame
as
that
sounds
but
think
about
it
when
you
take
a
sip
next
time
aftertaste
is
a
bit
spicey
but
perfect
in
the
sense
mouthfeel
is
full
complex
and
warming
with
the
perfect
amount
of
carbonation
a
bit
of
burning
alcohol
in
the
throat
as
it
slides
down
but
the
alcohol
has
to
be
somewhere
with
a
10
2
abv
beer
hype
what
hype
this
beer
clearly
delivers
oh
its
so
sad
to
see
it
go
who
knows
if
ill
ever
have
the
opportunity
again
im
just
at
a
loss
for
words
trying
to
describe
this
beer
anymore
believe
the
hype
and
if
you
have
a
chance
to
drink
this
do
it
the
smell
was
a
rich
aroma
of
fresh
dates
full
rich
taste
in
the
mouth
with
balanced
bitterness
the
finish
was
elegant
and
satisfying
and
not
overpowering
in
the
least
despite
the
alcohol
content
the
mouthfeel
was
really
exceptional
and
the
finish
satisfying
long
and
lingering
the
subtle
carbonation
stayed
for
the
duration
of
the
tasting
even
while
there
was
less
than
a
half
inch
left
in
the
glass
this
was
truly
a
delightful
taste
experience
many
thanks
for
this
one
d
a
great
quadruple
simply
the
best
i
could
drink
it
night
after
night
however
living
3000
miles
from
the
source
makes
the
price
per
unit
of
enjoyment
a
bit
out
of
my
everyday
range
hence
it
is
my
special
treat
when
i
want
to
go
to
a
happy
place
this
is
the
beer
for
me
pours
a
very
dark
brown
big
fluffy
head
that
dissipates
somewhat
quick
silky
white
lacing
looks
delicious
too
many
smells
to
distinguish
fig
caramel
raison
plumb
jam
malt
honey
tea
spices
and
mild
alcohol
flavors
are
abundant
as
well
it
tastes
of
all
that
the
smell
indicates
and
it
is
an
unreal
flavor
experience
the
warming
from
the
alcohol
is
the
only
indication
that
it
exists
a
spicy
semi
dry
finish
the
drinkability
is
unreal
for
any
beer
especially
for
this
type
and
abv
lives
up
to
the
hype
through
and
through
a
unique
experience
that
should
be
on
every
bas
list
d
a
great
nuanced
ale
lives
up
to
the
hype
drinkability
is
very
good
considering
the
strength
fcking
delicious
well
worth
the
extravagant
amount
of
money
spent
on
it
it
seriously
tasted
like
an
explosion
of
flavour
in
my
mouth
i
would
recommend
this
to
anyone
who
is
a
serious
beer
drinker
and
especially
anyone
who
likes
belgian
style
ales
this
is
the
best
of
trappist
market
the
best
the
world
has
to
offer
this
was
my
first
and
more
than
likely
last
experience
with
westy
12
as
good
as
it
was
there
are
other
more
accessible
quads
st
bernardus
12
trappistes
rochefort

just
as
good
that
dont
break
the
bank
like
this
does
one
of
those
at
least
now
i
can
say
i
tried
it
beers
now
onto
the
dark
lord
d
damn
an
amazingly
superb
beer
that
is
worth
the
hype
this
one
easily
makes
my
top

thanks
again
to
my
fellow
anonymous
ba
for
sharing
this
amazing
and
understandably
highlysoughtafter
beer
dude
you
are
excellent
mouthfeel
is
very
warm
because
of
the
high
abv
carbonation
is
very
filling
too
d
high
if
only
this
were
not
one
of
the
hardest
beers
to
obtain
in
the
world
i
would
have
this
available
to
me
on
a
regular
basis
looks
like
i
just
have
to
go
back
to
belgium
many
thanks
to
hardtarget
for
graciously
sharing
this
rare
example
got
as
a
gift
from
my
best
friend
who
ordered
from
belgianshop
com
poured
from
a
33cl
bottle
with
a
best
by
date
of
oct
09
into
my
nbb
snifter
the
color
was
an
reddish
brown
and
had
a
ton
of
yeast
bits
it
had
a
very
small
beige
head
that
quickly
dissipated
no
film
collar
or
lacing
i
thought
i
had
let
it
warm
enough
but
was
just
getting
to
temp
when
i
opened
it
so
the
initial
aroma
was
good
but
not
great
after
it
got
to
temp
yes
i
used
a
cooking
thermometer
as
my
wife
chuckled
at
me
screw
it
good
beer
deserves
to
be
treated
with
respect
the
aroma
really
developed
and
was
exceptional
was
strong
on
raisins
and
plum
with
a
sweetness
surrounding
it
all
could
smell
the
alcohol
but
it
wasnt
overpowering
so
no
problem
the
taste
was
really
good
but
didnt
live
up
to
the
aroma
or
the
hype
it
was
exceptionally
smooth
for
a
quad
but
just
didnt
blow
me
away
i
enjoyed
it
but
ive
had
better
quads
tastewise
the
mouthfeel
was
also
really
good
creamy
and
smooth
while
not
the
best
taste
for
a
quad
it
was
definitely
extremely
drinkable
for
a
quad
very
smooth
im
going
to
have
to
get
some
more
and
make
sure
this
sample
was
up
to
snuff
overall
a
great
beer
that
you
definitely
need
to
try
but
its
overhyped
in
my
opinion
due
to
the
rareness
of
it
get
a
bottle
if
you
can
but
dont
give
the
arm
and
leg
for
it
just
one
of
em
4

rr
t
y
d
i
thought
it
was
a
decent
beer
but
no
way
1
i
think
it
is
quite
a
lot
over
hyped
i
did
this
in
a
blind
tasting
with
st
bernys
12
and
i
choose
that
over
this
hands
down
drinkability
shes
a
sipper
ive
had
many
quads
before
some
of
my
favorate
being
kasteelbier
brune
trappistes
rochefort
10
st
bernardus
abt
12
60th
anniversary
somehow
this
is
more
than
just
a
good
quad
this
is
a
good
total
beer
im
still
savoring
it
as
for
this
being
the
best
beer
in
the
world
that
remains
to
be
seen
but
as
for
quadrupels
there
is
no
comparison
as
one
would
expect
this
beer
has
a
mouthfeel
smoother
than
velvet
the
carbonation
is
incredibly
fine
supremely
drinkable
i
could
drink
2034578349
more
of
these
if
i
didnt
get
so
buzzed
up
off
just
one
overall
this
one
took
me
back
to
my
vacation
in
belgium
touring
the
abbeys
eating
cheese
mingling
a
snap
shot
of
pure
happiness
in
life
this
12
bottle
of
beer
helped
me
to
think
back
and
relive
one
of
the
greatest
experiences
in
life
is
it
to
late
to
step
away
from
life
and
check
into
westvleteren
to
devote
my
life
to
beer
those
monks
know
what
they
are
doing
and
they
do
it
oh
so
well
an
easily
drinkable
beer
but
definitely
something
to
be
savored
not
rushed
i
look
forward
to
the
next
chance
i
get
to
enjoy
this
incredible
beer
hopefully
that
chance
may
come
soon
opened
this
with
a
friend
a
fellow
beer
lover
5
months
before
best
of
date
cap
off
and
into
a
chimay
glass
mmm
tastes
like
hype
a
brown
body
with
red
rimmed
highlights
and
a
decent
white
head
of
small
bubbles
the
smell
is
close
to
unappealing
to
me
my
friend
really
likes
it
but
to
me
the
alcohol
pops
out
and
there
is
a
cooked
raisin
smell
that
sends
this
sideways
the
taste
is
decent
it
has
depth
of
flavor
and
the
yeast
adds
some
nice
edges
of
phenol
with
lots
of
dried
fruit
and
some
caramel
with
even
a
touch
of
more
mellow
dark
malt
and
then
the
alcohol
comes
through
warming
all
it
touches
good
mouthfeel
full
but
not
too
dense
something
to
have
once
in
a
while
when
you
can
find
it
but
not
my
favorite
shrug
once
again
this
is
mostly
hype
5
0
drinkability
despite
all
the
complexities
of
this
beer
i
could
easily
guzzle
this
in
a
heartbeat
but
i
never
would
because
i
know
its
too
hard
to
get
and
every
sip
should
be
savored
i
enjoyed
this
beer
by
itself
but
i
can
only
imagine
what
it
would
be
like
paired
with
a
simply
yet
delicious
monklike
meal
i
was
thinking
just
simple
rice
at
the
time
of
drinking
not
sure
why
ive
got
5
bottles
left
of
3
different
vintages
i
am
hooked
and
want
more
this
beer
lives
up
to
the
hype
of
course
i
could
drink
tons
of
these
too
bad
i
may
never
get
to
belgium
d
very
outstanding
beer
but
not
my
favorite
quad
d
an
excellent
beer
no
doubt
worth
the
hype
if
not
the
crazy
lengths
some
people
go
to
to
obtain
the
1ranked
beer
in
the
world
incredibly
complex
fantastic
aroma
nice
experience
overall
cant
wait
for
the
next
occasion
to
have
another
i
was
overly
excited
when
a
buddy
of
mine
bought
a
case
of
this
and
we
were
to
have
it
for
our
final
beer
club
beer
500
this
beer
poured
a
dark
amber
haze
with
a
sizeable
head
smelled
slightly
sweet
with
a
little
spice
and
apple
juice
notes
starts
off
with
spiced
apple
juice
some
sweet
brown
sugar
flavors
dark
dried
fruit
flavors
a
little
more
spice
and
hints
of
lemon
at
the
end
of
every
few
sips
more
alcohol
warmth
than
i
would
have
liked
it
overpowered
some
of
the
flavors
and
stood
out
more
as
the
beer
warmed
a
very
full
flavored
beer
but
not
as
good
as
i
was
expecting
in
fact
i
favor
several
quads
and
trippels
over
this
brew
it
was
worth
the
money
to
say
you
have
had
one
but
i
would
never
pay
the
high
price
to
have
this
beer
again
the
rarity
gives
this
beer
extremely
too
much
credit
overall
the
nose
does
not
do
it
justice
it
tastes
like
mystery
and
is
so
beautifully
balanced
throughout
it
is
dangerously
drinkable
for
a
quad
godliness
in
a
bottle
enticing
sweetish
aroma
color
is
dark
murky
brown
pours
with
a
big
white
head
sweet
malt
flavor
up
front
closely
followed
by
a
balancing
hit
of
bitterness
rich
complex
malt
hop
bitterness
and
complex
fruit
flavors
dance
in
my
mouth
the
attack
on
my
tastebuds
is
incredible
this
beer
has
a
long
lingering
finish
that
just
wont
quit
theres
also
a
touch
of
alcohol
warmth
to
the
finish
i
love
the
balance
of
this
beer
easily
one
of
the
best
beers
ive
ever
had
delicious
i
wish
i
had
more
pours
a
nice
small
head
that
falls
into
a
thin
layer
with
a
great
lacing
thats
very
strong
color
is
dark
brown
almost
red
the
smell
is
spiced
with
clove
cinnamin
brown
sugar
with
a
backround
of
belgian
candy
sugar
theres
also
dark
fruit
like
plum
taste
is
slightly
sweet
with
dark
fruit
and
spices
mouthfeel
is
a
little
hot
still
mouthfeel
is
smooth
just
a
little
hot
overall
this
is
a
nice
beer
to
have
once
in
a
while
i
would
like
to
cellar
more
and
get
different
vintages
this
beer
is
a
joy
to
drink
though
it
was
nothing
like
what
i
expected
i
guess
i
sort
of
expected
a
belgium
version
of
the
thomas
hardy
or
jw
lee
but
it
was
nothing
like
that
this
beer
is
incredibly
light
on
its
feet
for
such
a
big
beer
and
was
way
too
easy
to
drink
it
finishes
with
a
whisper
a
very
smooth
satisfying
end
to
a
nearly
flawless
beer
most
excellent
in
short
best
quadrupel
i
have
ever
had
though
that
might
only
get
it
into
my
top
15
or
so
beers
drinkability
wellhidden
alcohol
and
a
divinely
complex
flavor
profile
drink
on
i
got
this
beer
and
was
so
excited
to
try
it
due
to
the
many
good
things
that
have
been
said
about
it
after
drinking
this
i
realized
that
it
was
one
of
the
most
complex
and
tasty
beers
i
have
ever
had
it
was
like
velvet
but
abrasive
sweet
but
dry
i
could
go
on
and
on
but
never
the
less
remarkable
i
know
now
what
everyone
has
been
talking
about
a
rare
beer
but
worth
every
drop
wow
i
wasnt
sure
what
to
expect
with
all
the
hype
but
this
is
one
fine
beer
certainly
the
best
belgian
ive
had
i
dont
think
ill
be
trying
this
again
anytime
soon
due
to
the
troublecost
involved
with
getting
one
but
its
definitely
one
of
the
best
my
sweet
lord
ive
glimpsed
divinity
as
interpreted
by
the
hands
of
the
monks
at
st
sixtus
and
savored
by
me
ahem
this
sample
was
poured
into
a
belgian
beer
glass
with
a
small
lite
tan
head
only
a
little
lace
color
is
a
slightly
hazy
brown
with
hints
of
walnut
and
mahogoney
sensuously
aromatic
lots
of
levels
of
dark
fruit
berries
desserts
candies
specifically
chocolates
pastries
malt
blackberries
cherrys
and
many
others
that
just
goes
on
and
on
some
yeastiness
very
balanced
despite
its
rich
fullness
could
dwell
on
this
endlessly
so
much
going
on
velvety
texture
reminds
me
of
what
a
mink
jock
must
be
like
i
have
been
in
the
presense
of
divinity
and
drank
it
in
a
true
masterpiece
very
easy
to
drink
but
i
would
definitely
stave
off
from
drinking
2
in
one
night
better
to
save
it
for
another
joyous
occasion
as
i
said
above
this
beer
as
a
gift
might
force
me
to
rate
it
above
its
true
worth
i
worried
about
that
a
bit
but
westy
12
lives
up
to
all
of
the
hype
a
marvel
of
brewing
plus
it
adds
to
the
pride
of
being
catholic
just
a
bit
more
again
this
is
an
awesome
beer
i
encourage
you
to
try
it
but
i
was
expecting
it
to
be
far
and
away
the
best
edit
i
recently
found
out
that
the
date
on
the
cap
is
a
freshness
date
marked
for
three
years
after
the
date
of
bottling
so
this
was
vintage
2000
wow
it
was
probably
madeirized
but
whatever
it
was
it
was
fantastic
d
this
really
was
everything
i
wanted
it
to
be
and
lives
up
to
its
rep
by
far
the
best
belgian
i
have
had
it
is
just
on
another
level
the
aromas
and
flavors
were
so
unique
this
really
just
needs
to
be
tried
as
it
is
really
hard
to
describe
it
fantastic
brew
the
beer
pours
from
the
bottle
a
mahogany
color
that
is
slightly
less
intense
than
say
a
rocheforte
10
nice
thick
head
that
leaves
lacing
on
the
glass
flavor
is
of
raisins
caramal
malts
maple
syrup
in
the
background
and
a
alcohol
bite
that
is
well
within
line
for
the
high
alcohol
it
has
a
long
finish
a
sustain
like
a
gibson
les
paul
yeah
this
beer
goes
to
eleven
bottle
carried
back
from
the
monastery
and
cellared
for
1
12
years
pours
a
completely
opaque
very
dark
brown
with
a
dense
rocky
head
that
leaves
nice
lacing
on
the
sides
of
the
glass
smells
of
candied
fruits
plums
and
raisins
with
a
orange
note
in
the
background
and
a
dusky
rich
aroma
throughout
taste
a
5
doesnt
do
it
justice
fruits
up
front
mellowing
into
an
incredibly
smooth
malt
followed
by
nice
tannins
and
then
a
sharp
but
mellow
aftertaste
it
has
a
nice
warming
alcohol
finish
but
nothing
harsh
anywhere
in
this
beer
the
mouthfeel
is
oily
and
chewy
dense
and
spectacular
the
drinkability
is
only
limited
by
the
availability
we
bought
a
case
of
this
in
belgium
and
went
through
it
like
shit
through
my
dog
after
hes
gotten
into
the
trash
i
hate
to
just
jump
on
the
bandwagon
but
this
really
does
live
up
to
its
reputation
this
is
quite
possibly
the
best
beer
ive
ever
had
and
is
just
a
testament
to
what
brewing
can
be
hallelujah
bought
a
4
pack
at
the
kulminator
poured
a
dark
brown
with
a
nice
thick
head
spicy
malty
aroma
with
hints
of
sweetness
slight
sweet
and
malty
flavor
also
i
honestly
thought
this
would
be
better
than
it
was
dont
get
me
wrong
this
was
an
awesome
beer
but
i
guess
with
all
the
hype
i
thought
it
would
be
much
better
ok
the
westy
poured
out
a
soft
dark
velvety
brown
with
a
light
caramel
colored
frothy
head
sticky
lacing
slides
down
the
sides
the
nose
offers
deep
wood
notes
prune
chocolate
caramel
sweet
toffee
cherry
maple
syrup
mollasses
and
lots
of
other
sticky
sweet
flavors
the
taste
starts
off
with
all
of
those
sticky
sweet
notes
mostly
maple
syrup
caramel
sticky
bun
then
goes
sharp
for
a
moment
before
descending
into
chocolate
some
anise
a
little
wood
and
some
faint
orange
wow
the
mouthfeel
is
clean
and
prickly
finishing
super
clean
not
cloying
at
all
in
any
way
immensely
and
dangerously
drinkable
d
this
is
a
good
end
of
the
night
sip
for
an
hour
and
a
half
kind
of
beer
very
complicated
decided
that
the
ol
westy
12
was
worthy
of
my
500th
beer
review
330
ml
bottle
which
i
found
at
the
wine
warehouse
in
charlottesville
over
a
year
ago
14907
inkjet
printed
on
the
cap
it
pours
a
deep
brownishred
that
is
crimson
in
the
light
but
i
didnt
decant
carefully
enough
as
there
is
a
lot
of
yeast
in
suspension
it
has
light
carbonation
and
a
halfinch
head
that
leaves
some
nice
lacing
the
aroma
is
quite
nice
vinous
and
sweet
with
ripe
grapes
and
raspberries
figs
apples
pine
cookie
batter
and
doughy
yeast
it
tastes
of
sweet
and
toasted
lightly
smoky
malts
green
hops
a
medium
bitterness
melon
green
apple
raspberry
strawberry
a
flash
of
banana
a
light
herbal
quality
belgian
yeast
and
very
light
oxidation
in
the
form
of
paper
it
has
light
smooth
carbonation
on
the
palate
with
a
medium
drying
body
that
becomes
more
full
and
leaves
a
medium
to
long
finish
it
is
both
immensely
drinkable
and
a
very
nice
ale
but
my
bottle
was
a
bit
past
its
prime
i
would
love
to
taste
a
fresh
one
purchased
directly
from
the
abbey
i
imagine
that
is
a
divine
experience
best
beer
in
the
world
perhaps
not
but
its
a
beautifully
crafted
trappist
that
is
worth
at
least
half
of
the
hype
that
surrounds
it
while
this
is
a
damn
fine
beer
this
is
not
the
beer
to
end
all
other
beers
it
is
very
good
well
crafted
and
delicate
in
its
approach
but
it
is
not
deserving
of
the
incredible
hype
it
gets
in
this
country
we
are
blessed
to
have
a
wide
selection
of
great
belgian

beers

all
also
excellent
beers
that
are
similar
to
the
famous
westy
it
lived
up
to
the
hype
i
wish
getting
another
one
would
be
a
little
easier

i
like
the

better
its
more
of

mouth
and
the
drinkability
i
have
to
give
a
high
mark
because
it
was
very
smooth
and
balanced
the
real
test
was
that
i
was
with
a

and
she
probably
drank
more
of
it

i
did

good
alternative
if
you
cannot
find
this
beer
worth
the
money
i
paid
for
it
i
still
got
one
bottle
so
tempted
to
drink
my
precious
010706
this
beer
looked
and
smelled
great
as
was
expected
making
waiting
to
warm
and
drink
it
very
difficult
it
poured
with
some
life
leaving
a
small
but
fragrant
head
and
a
dark
brown
root
beer
color
this
is
the
best
beer
i
have
ever
had
it
is
so
good
that
it
acts
like
several
beers
first
you
have
the
high
alcohol
sweet
honey
maple
like
a
trappist
or
abbey
ale
then
you
have
the
lasting
alcohol
burn
of
a
barley
wine
then
you
have
the
crisp
clean
thirst
quenching
finish
that
makes
it
thoroughly
satisfying
and
wanting
more
silky
rich
with
a
panoply
of
flavors
that
linger
on
your
palate
even
with
a
piece
of
pungent
english
stilton
westy

compliments
it
well
and
cuts
right
through
it

it
at

drinkability
is
fantastic
this
is
world
class
but
high
abv
sippin
beer
for
sure
but
its
just
a
rare
treat
to
sit
sip
and
savor
this
simply
great
stuff
a
densely
creamy
tan
head
rests
lazily
atop
a
hazy
dark
russett
body
carefully
poured
from
a
longstanding
bottle
its
a
clear
ruby
with
orange
highlights
but
add
the
yeast
later
on
eventually
the
head
receeds
but
its
somehow
able
to
hold
a
thin
but
completely
solid
cap
throughout
the
entire
beer
and
initially
it
leaves
solid
walls
of
thin
lace
that
fade
to
become
sheets
of
tiny
spots
towards
the
end
of
the
chalice
and
thats
no
easy
feat
given
its
10
2
abv
the
nose
offers
honeyish
nutty
cocoaish
ovaltine
bready
and
caramel
drenched
malt
as
well
as
a
bit
of
hard
candy
and
some
chewy
fruit
raisins
berries
its
velvety
smooth
across
the
palate
with
a
full
dextrinous
body
and
exceptionally
fine
natural
carbonation
the
flavor
is
even
more
exquisite
than
the
nose
implies
and
includes
notes
of
soft
anise
lemon
rind
a
touch
of
leather
some
delicate
bubblegum
and
a
mild
floral
character
that
really
helps
to
round
it
out
they
yeast
is
incredibly
important
as
well
as
it
gives
it
depth
and
rounds
it
out
and
it
should
be
poured
even
with
an
aged
bottle
finally
one
of
the
things
that
makes
the
westy
12
such
a
stunning
beer
is
that
its
so
soft
and
supple
considering
its
such
a
behemoth
the
alcohol
is
barely
noticeable
and
when
it
does
appear
in
the
flavor
it
only
helps
by
lending
a
spicy
character
and
despite
the
amount
of
character
it
has
its
actually
not
as
malty
as
a
doppelbock
its
lighter
and
it
finishes
semidry
with
more
spiciness
and
yeastiness
than
sweet
malt
that
might
build
on
the
palate
giving
it
a
really
great
drinkability
impressive
to
say
the
least
this
is
a
brilliant
beer
because
its
big
enough
to
deliver
a
great
richness
and
lots
of
complexity
but
also
incredibly
wellbalanced
enough
that
it
really
leaves
you
wanting
more

oh
this

we

it
was
worth
the
effort
pours
a
dark
cloudy
red
brown
with
a
tan

that
looks
amazing
but
doesnt
look
as
amazing
as
i
thought
still
exceptional
aroma
was
almost
winelike
with
dark
fruits
and
a
strong
breadiness
very
good
but
still
not
the
best
i
have
smelt

is
amazingly
all
over

was

this
beer
is
exceptional
and
definitely

i
had
one
better
than
it
so
far
next

a

lovers
dream

i
had
an

sundae
topped
with
a
beer
sauce
made
from
the
12
beer
and
ice
cream
may
not
sound
tempting
to
everyone
but
it
was
unbelievable
i
will
never
forget
this
experience
and
will
definitely
return
to
st
sixtus
happy
birthday
to
clvand0
with
the
drinking
of
this
beer
although
it
was
a
few
days
ago
i
still
cant
get
this
one
out
of
my
head
the
beer
poured
a
beautiful
dark
brown
color
with
a
2
finger
head
that
barely
falls
at
all
the
lace
is
almost
solid
around
the
top
of
the
chalice
as
i
drank
the
beer
down
the
nose
was
very
fruity
with
lots
of
sweet
fig
tones
and
an
almost
appley
crisp
aroma
there
is
a
nice
spiceyness
as
it
warms
as
well
the
flavor
is
awesome
very
mellow
wtih
a
spiceyness
and
an
alcohol
burst
that
play
very
well
together
the
flavor
moves
into
the
fig
and
slightly
bready
notes
but
also
with
a
touch
bitter
on
the
finish
the
feel
was
smooth
slightly
creamy
and
moderate
to
thick
just
a
nice
beer
i
didnt
want
to
put
the
glass
down
with
this
beer
this
is
definately
a
world

beer

it
still

alcohol
warms
as
i
taste
this
malt
sweetness
dominates
nutty
caramelly
and
creamy
vanilla
in
the
finish
the
beer
sits
on
the
tongue
and
lingers
with
a
warm
malt
creaminess
this
is
a
great
beer
the
only
thing
keeping
this
from
being
a
daily
beer
is
the
availability
pours
a
stunning
hazy
brown
with
a
frothy
head
smells
very
sweet
and
caramelly
malty
upfront
with
a
nice
floral
hoppy
back
now
for
the
taste
i
also
love
wine
and
this
is
almost
a
wine
to
me
except
far
surpassing
any
wine
ive
ever
had
tastes
so
complex
and
smooth
and
fruity
and
malty
and
sweet
and
hoppy
and
bready
and
so
so
much
more
this
is
a
beer
words
cannot
describe
this
is
one
of
my
first
attempts
at
trappist
beer
and
i
must
say
ive
never
been
more
impressed
with
a
beer
this
is
beer
perfection
this
is
beer
paradise
this
is
beer
bliss
this
is
beer
period
i
had
this
first
about
a
year
or
so
ago
when
i
was
really
starting
to
get
into
craft
beers
i
decided
to
wait
a
while
though
before
i
tried
it
again
as
it
had
so
much
going
on
i
couldnt
appreciate
it
all
bottle
is
dated
with
070904
so
i
will
have
to
pick
up
a
few
to
age
this
poured
out
a
murky
brown
with
a
tall
light
tan
head
that
filled
the
goblet
there
were
some
floaties
that
could
be
seen
occasionally
and
the
beer
coated
the
glass
in
rings
of
lace
the
head
managed
to
stay
afloat
till
the
end
which
was
impressive
aroma
is
very
fruity
with
raisins
and
other
dark
fruit
it
was
quite
sweet
and
spicy
as
well
with
a
touch
of
yeast
the
taste
starts
of
with
a
strong
fruity
sweetness
before
a
good
bit
of
spice
comes
through
to
even
things
out
a
bit
earthiness
is
also
in
full
swing
here
adding
a
touch
of
bitterness
before
the
spicy
sweet
after
taste
wow
there
is
just
so
much
going
on
here
i
feel
like
i
am
still
missing
out
on
plenty
mouthfeel
is
full
and
creamy
with
good
carbonation
this
bottle
went
down
easily
but
i
would
be
reluctant
to
grab
another
right
after
not
sure
why
but
one
was
plenty
amazing
beer
that
everyone
should
get
a
chance
to
try
33
cl
bottle
date
code
of
30
03
02
on
cap
no
price
on
bottle
but
seem
to
recall
8
as
being
the
price
none
of
the
westy
beers
poured
very
clean
the
sediment
separated
no
matter
how
carefully
the
beer
was
decanted
with
the
higher
alcohol
in
this
beer
you
could
not
drink
a
ton
but
the
smooth
viscous
nature
of
the
flavors
and
the
deep
maltiness
make
you
want
to
try
finally
decided
to
open
this
bottle
and
see
what
the
fuss
is
about
poured
a
rich
mahogany
colour
with
an
nice
fluffy
offwhite
head
smell
is
or
dried
fruits
prunes
spice
and
a
brown
sugar
flavour
was
huge
well
rounded
caramel
flavours
combined
with
liqour
soaked
dried
fruits
a
bit
of
dark
sweet
bread
in
the
middle
i
think
exceptionally
well
balanced
carbonation
was
good
and
the
alcohol
was
well
hidden
drinkability
would
i
have
another
of
course
this
was
a
very
tasty
brew
was
it
the
best
of
the
best
not
in
my
opinion
but
then
again
tasting
is
subjective
and
can
vary
with
time
and
place
a
topnotch
beer
to
say
the
least
but
not
the
holy
grail
to
me
mouthfeel
is
good
really
spot
on
carbonation
and
body
are
well
balanced
and
make
for
a
lucious
drinking
experience
a
little
more
body
wouldnt
hurt
though
drinkability
well
damn
i
could
drink
this
all
night
problem
is
id
be
drinking
it
on
the
street
because
my
home
would
be
repossesed
if
this
was
a
bit
more
affordable
it
would
be
a
5
for
drinkability
if
you
have
yet
to
try
this
gem
track
it
down
asap
its
worth
the
hunt
edit
i
got
the
chance
to
try
both
the
rochefort
10
and
the
st
bernardus
12
and
i
think
that
the
st
bernardus
was
good
but
a
tad
watery
and
i
will
have
to
try
the
rochefort
and
westvleteren
again
because
the
rochefort
was
so
good
from
my
tasting
notes
tasted
on
11404
how
lucky
was
i
to
find
a
case
of
this
in
pa
expensive
but
well
worth
it
poured
a
beautiful
dark
mahagony
with
a
small
tan
head
initial
aromas
of
maple
syrup
brown
sugar
molasses
and
fruits
soft
tastes
sugar
fruits
molasses
prunes
dates
so
many
tastes
coming
thru
alcohol
content
well
hidden
i
cant
sayput
into
words
the
depth
and
greatness
of
this
beer
im
delighted
i
want
it
i
miss
it
already
this
beer
has
extraordinary
balance
and
complexity
it
does
not
hit
you
over
the
head
it
just
states
itself
perfectly
with
nothing
out
of
place
i
equate
it
with
veuve
cliquot
la
grande
dame
what
to
say
about
this
beer
well
to
say
is
that
i
can
dream
the
road
to
the
abbey
and
to
know
that
its
a
day
job
just
to
get
a
couple
of
casses
you
can
guess
how
we
i
never
go
alone
think
about
this
beer
just
getting
the
smell
of
all
the
fruit
and
hops
makes
me
dream
away
drinking
it
you
go
to
beerheaven
and
afterwards
you
just
feel
in
a
green
field
with
beautifull
hopflowers
of
poperinge
well
thats
not
too
far
from
westvleteren
so
i
mostly
go
for
another
one
because
there
is
no
other
beer
that
you
want
after
a
12
then
another
12
one
can
perhaps
see
why
these
european
lowlanders
thought
so
much
blood
was
worth
expending
to
maintain
tropical
spice
island
and
plantation
colonies
in
another
era
flavors
like
these
are
as
cheap
today
as
12
or
so
a
third
liter
best
before
date
of
21

02
stamped
on
the
bottle
cap
how
good
is
this
sob
fresh
complex
melded
flavor
up
front
the
beer
is
lacking
in
my
opinion
but
does
possess
notes
of
cherries
and
grapes
midpalate
leans
into
a
brandylike
sweetness
notes
of
caramel
and
pepper
and
finishes
with
hints
of
plums
and
berries
the
alcohol
is
precisely
hidden
throughout
the
brew
and
it
simply
just
doesnt
show
its
potency
that
being
said
i
truly
dont
find
this
beer
to
be
all
that
flavorful
and
i
never
have
its
a
great
beer
but
i
dont
think
its
the
best
beer
in
the
world
i
can
see
why
others
do
though
the
massive
hype
surrounding
this
beer
is
absolutely
justified
pure
beer
perfection
definitely
the
best
trappist
ive
ever
tried
worthy
of
its
long
held
place
at
the
top
of
the
vaunted
best
of
ba
list
taste
is
sweet
initially
with
fruity
notes
almost
seems
to
evaporate
on
your
tongue
leaving
the
slight
alcohol
flavors
to
mingle
with
the
dark
fruits
mouthfeel
is
great
creamy
and
smooth
and
drinkability
is
excellent
as
youd
have
to
sit
and
drink
a
few
before
nailing
down
everything
thats
going
on
for
the
senses
unfortunately
abv
kind
of
prevents
you
from
reexamining
many
in
a
row
and
then
theres
that
whole
availability
problem
as
was
the
8
worth
the
search
to
enjoy
in
sum
the
best
example
of
this
style
and
one
of
the
best
beers
ive
had
flavor
appears
onedimensional
at
first
but
becomes
obviously
more
complex
and
mellows
as
it
warms
more
dry
than
i
had
expected
a
great
warming
sensation
and
a
nice
buzz
that
seems
to
come
only
from
the
trappist
brews
had
this
at
5
in
the
morning
while
doing
some
last
minute
packing
will
have
to
try
it

up
very
flavorful
even
in
its
fragile
nature
for
such
a
big
beer
this
is
incredibly
drinkable
mouthfeel
is
very
light
and
airy
carbonation
is
moderate
very
enjoyable
brew
if
this
is
aged
beer
i
hope
i
live
a
long
life
the
only
downfall
for
me
in
drinkability
was
the
price
at
11
00
a
bottle
it
would
hurt
my
bank
account
a
bit
to
drink
more
really
one
of
the
most
complex
beers
ive
ever
sat
down
to
a
full
bottle
presents
new
flavors
with
each
sip
some
dwindling
with
warmth
as
others
take
their
place
with
the
complexity
came
some
unpleasant
flavors
and
i
thought
the
sweetness
was
overbearing
especially
when
approaching
room
temperature
i
didnt
care
for
the
yeast
flavor
which
was
quite
prominent
or
the
muddy
drone
of
the
malt
but
that
could
have
something
to
do
with
a
couple
years
on
the
brew
maybe
the
brew
would
present
itself
differently
when
fresh
id
hope
for
something
a
bit
more
toned
and
alert
feeling
a
fine
belgian
ale
but
nothing
id
consider
world
class
material
im
actually
surprised
at
how
well
regarded
this
is
possibly
something
to
do
with
its
scarcity
i
dont
expect
ill
be
paying
9
for
a
second
bottle
nor
going
through
the
trouble
to
get
it
one
was
more
than
enough
it
certainly
does
have
personality
and
i
doubt
id
ever
mistake
this
for
another
beer
really
drinkable
if
you
can
find
a
bottle
i
have
been
storing
these
two
bottles
for
a
long
time
had
one
in
late
winter
2011
its
very
classy
averaging
my
individual
5
ratings
on
it
paid
8
50
for
the
11
ounce
bottle
a
fantastic
example
of
a
belgian
ale
but
maybe
not
quite
as
good
as
rochefort
10
didnt
live
up
to
my
extremely
high
expectations
i
thought
it
was
great
but
rochefort
10
truly
is
the
greatest
quadrupel
inmo
this
has
to
be
one
of
the
best
beers
i
have
ever
tasted
it
is
so
complex
that
my
pallete
was
exhausted
after
drinking
one
it
is
a
beer
that
you
will
never
forget
pours
out
dark
with
a
small
tan
head
served
in
the
proper
glassware
it
looks
splended
velvet
smooth
mouthfeel
makes
for
so
smooth
and
so
perfect
smiles
this
is
a
fine
crafted
beer
which
is
certainly
in
a
class
by
itself
best
belgian
trappist
brew
hands
down
best
beer
i
dont
think
one
can
cross
compare
styles
this
immaculate
elixir
poured
a
beautiful
cloudy
brown
color
with
a
medium
tan
head
roma
was
that
of
dark
fruits
such
as
grapes
and
plums
it
had
a
creamy
mouthfeel
and
a
sweet
fruity
but
at
the
same
time
nutty
and
slightly
chocolately
tsate
slight
alcohol
burn
as
the
beer
warmed
up
calling
this
a
beer
is
an
understatement
more
like
heaven
regardless
this
is
absolutely
lusty
and
gratifying
westvleteren
12
is
worldclass
no
doubt
about
it
i
can
appreciate
this
beer
i
think
i
respect
this
beer
i
even
like
this
beer
a
lot
i
just
dont
love
this
beer
call
me
a
hophead
call
me
an
unrefined
simpleton
call
me
what
you
will
but
thats
how
i
feel
at
this
juncture
in
my
journey
that
doesnt
mean
that
westvleteren
12
is
anything
less
than
incredible
everyone
should
have
the
chance
to
sample
it
at
least
once
this
is
a
very
complex
beer
and
i
am
very
glad
to
finally
have
tried
it
and
add
the
bottle
to
my
collection
is
it
the
best
beer
ive
ever
had
tough
to
say
top
15
easy
go
and
look
for
it
this
gusher
finally
settles
with
a
giant
light
tan
head
thats
not
overly
persistent
atop
a
brown
body
with
copper
notes
dark
brown
yeast
flocs
populate
the
glass
and
take
their
time
settling
a
huge
malty
aroma
leaps
from
the
glass
with
a
strong
merlotlike
vinous
quality
and
a
touch
of
vinegar
smooth
sweetness
and
spritzy
carbonation
battle
for
predominance
as
a
manylayered
symphony
of
malt
and
alcohol
warms
and
entices
the
palate
this
finishes
wit
a
moderate
alcohol
heat
and
mild
earthy
hop
character
that
emerge
and
linger
as
the
formidable
malt
dissipates
bottle
poured
a
deep
ruby
colored
beer
with
a
huge
thick
foamy
dark
white
head
with
incredible
retention
the
head
was
still
in
place
when
drinking
the
last
sip
of
this
beer
30
minutes
after
the
bottle
had
been
opened
carbonation
is
really
good
with
lots
of
bubble
at
the
bottom
of
the
glass
and
some
other
ones
sticking
on
the
side
of
the
glass
aroma
is
comprised
of
light
and
sweet
roastiness
with
a
nice
touch
of
spice
but
i
could
not
detect
any
alcohol
taste
is
an
almost
perfect
mix
between
caramel
malts
candi
sugar
and
something
else
which
might
be
cinnamon
i
was
really
glad
that
i
could
not
taste
the
alcohol
since
it
could
have
been
quite
harsh
at
10
2
wow
what
a
beer
i
originally
thought
that
this
might
be
a
bit
of
an
over
hyped
beer
but
im
glad
to
report
that
it
lives
up
to
all
the
praises
the
taste
is
a
perfect
and
subtle
balance
of
dark
caramel
malts
and
kind
of
hidden
so
floral
hops
i
got
the
impression
to
eat
a
slice
of
amazing
bread
this
beers
so
nutritive
a
veil
of
citrus
and
a
note
of
raisin
and
grape
appear
also
with
a
wooden
and
slightly
tart
aspect
of
some
great
wines
what
an
amazing
beer
a
masterpiece
that
wonderfully
hides
its
power
i
had
read
a
lot
about
it
i
had
thought
about
it
a
lot
and
i
will
continue
to
do
so
i
thouroghly
enjoyed
this
beer
i
cant
wait
for
the
other
to
be
opened
only
a
couple
more
years
to
go
i
think
its
a
very
drinkable
beer
but
i
can
say
i
would
not
spend
the
8
9
bucks
for
a
12
ounce
bottle
again
if
i
had
my
choice
i
would
go
after
the
blue
cap
first
brewed
in
march
2004
and
sampled
in
may
2004
ive
got
five
more
that
ill
put
away
for
aging
i
cant
wait
to
see
how
this
beer
matures
direct
from
my
trip
belgium
trip
i
had
to
bring
back
5
fresh
ones
unlabeled
brown
bottle
light
cherry
color
in
the
goblet
with
a
big
persistant
pale
tan
head
lots
of
little
bubbles
of
lively
carbonation
caramel
sweet
nose
with
touches
of
pineapple
mecinal
vapers
and
clean
hops
in
the
sinus
a
beautiful
look
in
the
glass
sorf
round
taste
of
caramel
and
malt
initally
followed
by
ripe
plums
and
sour
pear
it
tastes
as
good
as
it
looks
so
rounded
and
full
of
flavor
very
very
soft
and
smooth
in
the
mouth
the
abv
ia
well
hidden
behind
dark
fruits
and
toasted
caramel
sweetness
lots
of
sediment
in
the
bottom
of
the
bottle
carefully
pour
this
beauty
a
classic
11
2
ounce
bottle
expensive
i
think
i
paid
over
7
for
this
little
sucker
anyway
pours
dark
and
viscous
this
stuff
is
thick
raises
a
formidable
long
lasting
head
nose
of
spicesyeastearth
currants
and
musk
flavor
notes
of
fruit
earth
muskyness
and
yeast
complex
flavors
yeastyness
not
on
the
top
of
my
list
cuz
its
just
not
all
that
drinkable
imho
not
a
beer
for
beginners
all
strong
dark
belgian
lovers
rejoice
and
seek
out
this
classy
exotic
sipper
drinkability
as
with
most
of
the
really
interesting
beers
this
one
isnt
one
you
can
pound
down
one
after
the
other
this
is
a
sipping
beer
ng
last
of
5
trappist
brews
for
me
and
mkobes
in
our
trappist
tasting
this
is
my
fourth
overall
bottle
of
westy
12
and
will
not
be
the
last
this
one
had
a
date
on
the
cap
of
290903
so
i
think
this
may
have
expired
pours
a
murkey
deep
brown
color
with
floaties
and
a
perfect
trappist
head
beautiful
raisiny
musty
tobacco
and
stuff
aroma
big
fruity
malt
flavor
with
tobacco
and
raisins
rich
and
satisfying
this
one
seals
it
i
am
becomming
a
monk
in
a
trappist
monastary
the
flavors
come
on
in
waves
there
is
no
hop
bite
but
rather
a
mild
to
moderate
bitterness
with
none
of
that
pale
ale
floral
character
fades
to
a
dry
finish
quite
smooth
reminds
me
of
cognac
i
get
sweet
malt
and
caramel
ah
im
getting
the
sugar
now
theres
licorice
and
spiciness
and
something
else
i
cant
describe
its
full
bodied
and
rich
and
darn
smooth
the
finish
is
dry
but
you
still
have
the
taste
of
complex
fruit
in
your
mouth
the
alcohol
moves
in
with
gradual
warmth
i
sip
it
over
and
over
and
it
remains
a
complex
mystery
to
me
i
must
have
more
and
more
it
makes
me
hungry
though
i
just
finished
lunch
i
have
some
special
chinese
duck
that
has
been
cooked
with
soy
sauce
and
spices
five
spice
and
they
go
together
perfectly
finally
at
the
end
my
head
is
spinning
with
the
alcohol
this
wouldve
kicked
ass
in
the
middle
of
my
lunch
i
can
see
why
bas
love
this
beer
im
glad
i
bought
an
extra
bottle
drinkability
i
think
this
one
has
sipability
it
needs
to
be
taken
slowly
like
a
brandy
or
single
malt
its
in
that
class
of
beverage
feel
is
beyond
words
here
wow
amazingly
full
yet
calmingly
smooth
and
fluffy
with
a
heavenly
fine
carbonation
that
continues
to
give
way
to
the
flavors
never
too
sharp
and
never
too
distant
well
rounded
superbly
soft
and
exceptionally
drinkable
its
nearly
a
meal
it
doesnt
seem
to
have
10
8
abv
its
masked
very
well
one
isnt
enough
not
nearly
enough
i
will
need
to
get
more
alot
more
and
hopefully
begin
to
pick
out
what
it
is
about
this
beer
that
makes
my
eyebrows
raise
and
my
mind
go
huh
and
wow
loftly
noble
sublime
wonderfully
put
together
thank
you
gusler
it
pours
a
dark
brown
with
a
huge
head
the
aroma
has
some
dark
fruit
chocolate
and
yeast
the
flavors
are
very
complex
probably
the
most
complex
i
have
ever
had
the
body
is
rich
and
creamy
there
is
a
little
amount
of
spiciness
some
sweet
fruits
and
choclate
it
truly
is
transcendent
this
beer
is
so
far
away
from
macro
beers
that
i
cant
believe
they
are
related
disclaimer
it
is
the
first
time
i
have
this
beer
along
with
6
other
comparable
5
of
which
are
classified
as
abts
and
theres
only
one
among
the
6
that
ive
had
before
only
one
was
not
taken
blind
ommegang
three
philosophers
so
basically
ive
taken
the
5
following
beers
blind
in
the
same
session
rochefort
10
only
one
i
had
before
westvleteren
12
stbernardus
12
weyerbacher
quad
gulden
draak
all
5
were
taken
in
a
chimay
chalice
a
deep
chocolate
body
with
a
fully
diminishing
offwhite
head
initially
welllaced
bottleconditionned
with
some
beige
sediments
at
the
bottom
aroma
is
a
nice
blend
of
vanilla
and
chocolate
black
brown
and
white
milkshakish
slightly
vinous
it
didnt
grab
me
particularly
but
seriously
let
this
warm
and
this
becomes
a
tremendously
complex
malt
offering
fullbodied
creamy
with
a
good
carbonation
taste
is
loaded
with
dark
fruits
blackberries
plums
dates
its
a
complex
caramel
cream
with
a
chocolate
syrup
no
its
a
cake
its
a
pudding
with
a
little
alcohol
bite
very
complex
with
a
wellexpressed
yeastiness
definitely
the
most
complex
of
the
abts
its
delicious
for
sure
but
doesnt
strike
to
me
as
the
best
beer
in
the
world
its
the
best
balanced
of
the
big
dark
abt
trappist
styles
to
my
liking
but
its
not
necessarily
the
most
intense
although
such
a
refined
aftertaste
is
hard
to
match
maybe
i
will
rate
it
higher
in
a
future
tasting
it
sure
held
the
competition
in
a
blind
tasting
so
i
know
this
is
pure
worldclass
stuff
ill
have
to
get
into
deeper
analysis
eventually
and
will
definitely
enjoy
doing
so
by
the
way
this
was
a
nice
fit
with
the
great
quebeccer
cheese
victor
et
berthold
recommended
by
simonpatrice
and
provided
by
martint
big
cheers
to
ciderguy
and
hopsrus
for
each
hooking
me
up
with
a
westy
12
drinkability
is
probably
as
high
as
it
gets
although
complexity
makes
this
one
to
sip
and
savor
drinkability
tasty
and
well
made
but
i
believe
i
like
bernie
12
better
its
darker
richer
and
a
bit
more
complex
but
only
by
a
hair
palatewise
walletwise
i
like
bernie
12
by
a
toupee
worth
seeking
out
as
you
might
disagree
with
my
assessment
re
bernie
12
v
westy
12
poured
a
hazy
dark
caramel
with
a
small
creamy
mocha
head
it
had
a
rich
well
blended
malty
aroma
with
only
a
hint
of
alcohol
one
of
the
most
pleasant
aromas
ive
encountered
the
mouthfeel
was
almost
more
like
eating
than
drinking
it
was
full
and
flavorful
thick
and
heavy
on
the
palate
with
a
nice
carbonated
highlight
i
detected
toasted
chocolaty
hints
but
the
alcohol
was
quite
discernable
blended
enough
to
fit
well
with
the
flavor
but
a
definite
alcohol
presence
highly
drinkable
for
the
style
notes
excellent
beer
a
very
nice
solid
beer
super
drinkable
excellent
in
its
bitterness
but
there
is
just
too
much
alcohol
read
lack
of
balance
and
way
too
thick
any
beer
thicker
thank
heavy
whipping
cream
is
too
thick
well
i
had
a
bug
dive
bomb
this
beer
so
it
must
have
though
there
was
something
worth
drinking
in
my
glass
one
of
my
dogs
got
a
tasty
westy
soaked
morsel
because
of
that
while
this
beer
is
quite
good
i
am
quite
disappointed
in
some
ways
i
havent
had
this
in
a
couple
years
and
i
am
thinking
i
need
to
try
a
fresher
version
to
see
if
it
is
more
like
my
memory
of
having
this
in
belgium
and
at
the
hop
leaf
where
i
had
it
last
overall
complex
tasty
a
must
try
appearance
a
viscous
pour
mohogany
brown
color
with
the
unfiltered
approach
lets
the
light
through
but
very
cloudy
nice
creamy
textured
head
very
small
bubbles
gives
the
silky
appearance
lacing
forms
in
nice
bands
the
typical
belgian
style
lacing
going
down
overall
great
appearance
aroma
a
blissful
mixture
of
different
scents
this
beer
serves
up
a
great
spiced
tone
then
a
warming
sweet
dough
character
blended
with
raisins
and
alcohol
the
vinous
tone
is
the
hallmark
characteristic
the
one
that
stands
out
just
a
great
experience
even
if
it
costs
10
to
12
dollars
a
bottle
taste
alcohol
is
warming
and
blends
with
a
shortbread
cookie
and
overly
ripened
fruit
quality
cloves
and
spices
are
evident
as
well
this
beer
is
good
stuff
very
complex
mouthfeel
full
bodied
soft
silky
carbonation
coats
the
palate
with
a
pleasant
sensation
drinkability
massive
amounts
of
flavor
and
complex
aroma
equals
a
satisfying
drinking
session
this
beer
doesnt
mess
around
very
big
and
unique
all
on
its
own
cant
say
their
anything
that
compares
besides
the
st
bernadus
abt
many
thanks
to
paquette
for
importing
this
gift
by
hand
very
good
beer
not
the
best
to
sum
it
up
this
is
a
phenomenal
beer
i
really
enjoyed
it
on
its
own
several
hours
after
a
meal
and
i
plan
to
drink
it
that
way
again
to
really
take
advantage
of
its
complexity
and
craftsmanship
the
cost
is
a
factor
but
the
overall
experience
is
worth
the
price
of
admission
i
will
definitely
buy
this
beer
again
drinkability
is
hampered
by
two
things
the
sheer
magnitude
of
this
brew
and
the
that
accompanies
the
beer
deep
garnet
hued
with
a
thick
off
white
head
that
recedes
to
a
thin
but
persistant
film
chunks
of
sediment
are
suspended
as
if
frozen
in
amber
aroma
is
great
if
a
bit
subdued
with
a
hint
of
alcohol
evident
taste
of
raisins
plums
chocolate
yeast
and
a
touch
spicy
medium
mouthfeel
for
being
such
a
firebreather
it
sure
is
some
good
drinkin
if
it
wasnt
for
the
crazy
price
i
could
drink
it
all
day
overall
i
am
impressed
while
it
may
be
hyped
to
some
extent
i
can
honestly
say
i
have
never
tasted
anything
like
it
before
and
i
look
forward
to
that
asofyetunknown
special
occasion
where
i
can
break
out
my
other
bottle
and
sit
down
with
a
nice
cigar
and
enjoy
it
overall
impression
finally
after
all
the
hype
i
tried
this
beer
yeah
shame
on
me
for
taking
so
long
it
does
not
disappoint
a
world
class
beer
all
the
way
definitely
deserving
to
be
in
the
top
50
just
maybe
not
at
1
come
on
guys
is
the
abv
really
that
important
i
tried
to
review
this
without
the
beers
rep
clouding
my
judgement
and
also
before
the
beers
cojones
rendered
my
judgement
unreliable
it
pours
a
deep
dark
murky
brown
with
and
tannish
beige
head
an
earthy
aroma
of
cut
hay
coffee
cocoa
sweet
malt
hops
and
warming
alcohol
excites
the
olfactory
senses
sweet
caramel
malt
buttery
biscuits
toffee
banana
lemon
zest
light
pine
hint
of
herbs
and
flavors
of
dark
rum
mingle
and
dance
in
perfect
rhythm
and
harmony
this
is
a
very
drinkable
brew
for
something
of
this
strength
velvety
smooth
and
lush
is
there
a
perfect
beer
out
there
almost
try
the
blue
cap
abt
8
a
damn
fine
brew
but
i
am
still
partial
to
the
westy
8
over
this
one
it
pours
a
cloudy
amberbrown
colour
that
is
reminiscent
of
iced
tea
there
is
a
thin
head
here
which
is
quick
to
dissolve
and
leaves
virtually
no
lacing
the
smell
is
just
wonderful
with
cherry
grape
plum
and
apple
dominating
a
fruity
aroma
there
is
a
hint
of
alcohol
here
as
well
along
with
earthy
tones
the
taste
is
sweet
but
less
fruity
than
the
smell
and
more
focused
on
the
earthiness
in
the
smell
along
with
wood
notes
alcohol
is
definitely
present
yet
not
overpowering
caramel
biscuit
and
maltiness
were
also
hinted
at
throughout
this
one
is
nice
and
smooth
and
quite
easy
to
drink
though
the
alcohol
does
creep
up
on
you
suddenly
simply
a
great
brew
another
masterpiece
from
my
brown
hooded
brothers
comments

with
almost
zero
availability
here
in
seattle
i
was
thrilled
when
i
got
this
one
from
oldfrothingslosh
in
the
christmas
beer
exchange
coordinated
by
richard
mr
big
dog
himself
thanks
to
the
giving
spirit
of
the
ba
community
for
giving
me
the
opportunity
to
try
this
most
excellent
trappist
ale
11
2
oz
bottle
poured
a
deep
brown
with
a
huge
frothy
head
that
really
stuck
around
lots
of
lace
on
the
glass
aroma
is
a
complex
mix
malty
and
sweet
taste
is
as
complex
as
the
aromas
and
as
it
warms
it
changes
lots
of
sweetmalty
goodness
nice
and
creamy
feeling
and
it
goes
down
so
nice
the
alcohol
is
nicely
hidden
but
makes
itself
known
in
the
end
a
thoroughly
enjoyable
experiance
bottle
dated
011406
poured
a
cloudy
murky
brown
with
small
beige
head
and
light
lacing
aroma
is
decadent
malty
caramel
spicy
and
big
notes
of
sweet
cherries
body
is
full
smooth
and
delicate
on
the
tongue
possibly
the
most
smooth
ale
ive
experienced
the
flavor
of
this
beer
is
also
one
to
savor
and
combined
with
the
aroma
is
one
thats
hard
to
beat
thats
one
thing
about
this
ale
i
found
most
impressive
the
in
your
face
aroma
with
the
flavor
is
an
onslought
of
your
senses
the
malty
caramel
and
fruit
flavor
leads
to
a
gentle
warming
sensation
towards
the
middle
of
the
glass
im
glad
i
finally
had
a
chance
to
sample
this
wonder
but
at
a
price
of
13
a
bottle
its
one
i
wont
enjoy
often
the
only
downfall
of
this
brew
thick
shiny
khaki
meringue
like
head
awesome
l
acing
very
dark
brown
in
color
with
a
cola
hue
the
smell
is
of
dark
fruits
and
a
little
grape
popsicle
the
taste
is
hard
to
put
a
finger
on
theres
some
subdued
alcohol
a
lightly
bitter
aftertaste
a
little
captain
and
coke
the
taste
isnt
the
flavor
explosion
i
was
hoping
for
but
it
was
interesting
the
aftertaste
is
lightly
bitter
just
enough
to
cut
the
flavor
a
really
good
beer
not
quite
great
especially
when
price
is
brought
into
the
equation
easy
to
drink
because
its
so
good
but
the
large
alcohol
content
definitely
was
getting
to
me
not
sure
yet
if
its
worth
the
7
99
for
a
12
oz
bottle
but
its
still
pretty
amazing
acidy
sweet
finish
is
long
and
lingering
with
spices
and
plums
wyll
almost
to
room
temperature
now
its
got
a
kick
to
it
with
the
high
abv
highly
complex
all
around
definitely
a
special
occasion
brew
at
the
price
this
is
the
best
belgian
strong
ale
ive
had
in
my
life
including
a
few
ive
had
in
belgium
this
westy
is
for
sure
worthy
of
its
reputation
no
sediment
noted
and
i
just
drained
the
bottle
keeps
getting
better
and
leaves
you
with
a
warm
feeling
caramel
aftertaste
in
a
good
way
whew
quite
an
experience
thanks
to
pabobcat
westvleteren
12
is
a
beautiful
ruby
red
that
pours
with
a
slight
head
nice
lacing
on
my
chimay
chalice
as
i
sip
the
nose
is
full
of
sour
fruit
raisins
and
plums
the
sour
nose
gives
way
to
a
very
sweet
taste
belgian
candi
sugar
but
balanced
with
some
bready
undertones
this
beer
could
certainly
get
me
through
a
fast
im
not
sure
how
the
monks
maintain
their
vow
of
silence
after
drinking
this
all
i
want
to
do
is
talk
about
it
the
body
is
quite
light
actually
but
it
holds
up
to
the
abv
well
and
makes
for
a
very
drinkable
beer
i
can
see
how
this
would
get
better
with
age
as
some
of
the
residual
sugars
get
munched
on
by
the
yeast
i
think
ill
have
to
pick
up
another
bottle
i
dont
know
if
i
am
being
swayed
psychologically
by
this
being
the
rarest
trappist
beer
but
it
is
truly
amazing
i
had
been
saving
my
westy
12
for
a
special
occasion
like
maybe
my
100th
review
but
i
could
only
look
at
that
number
1
rating
so
long
so
i
popped
it
maybe
i
should
have
waited
it
looked
nice
enough
an
exquisite
brown
red
color
the
aroma
was
malty
sweet
with
some
citrus
but
somewhat
thin
and
evasive
the
taste
was
supposed
to
be
the
thing
just
send
me
to
7th
heaven
sorry
it
was
a
straight
malt
citrus
with
hints
of
cherry
nice
enough
but
simple
my
cap
read
080706
so
it
appears
that
this
beer
has
to
sit
just
on
its
rep
ill
buy
another
bottle
and
let
it
sit
drinkability
it
doesnt
get
much
better
than
this
a
world
class
beer
this
one
goes
into
my
top
10
for
sure
if
i
could
only
find
more
i
would
buy
them
all
the
pour
is
a
fuliginous
deep
cherry
red
color
with
a
behemothic
head
creamy
in
texture
and
a
beauteous
light
tan
color
as
the
head
unhastingly
erodes
a
splendid
sheet
of
lace
is
formed
to
unite
lovingly
with
the
glass
heavenly
is
the
word
that
best
describes
this
nose
ambrosial
hints
of
over
ripe
fruit
yeast
tones
also
noticeable
along
with
a
slight
hint
of
alcohol
start
is
thickly
malt
sweet
the
top
middling
in
its
feel
to
the
palate
finish
is
pleasantly
acidic
the
alcohol
grasp
the
taste
buds
in
a
anaconda
death
grip
the
dry
vinous
aftertaste
lingers
long
after
the
beer
is
gone
but
certainly
not
as
long
as
the
memory
of
this
fine
beer
as
it
stays
in
your
subconscience
like
your
first
kiss
dark
brown
color
medium
head
aroma
is
yeasty
and
sour
with
a
touch
of
fruitiness
wow
an
amazingly
complex
and
excellently
made
beer
full
bodied
malts
are
bold
and
flavorful
very
complex
seems
to
be
a
different
tasteflavor
aspect
with
every
sip
fruity
with
raisins
plums
and
cherries
interplaying
with
vanilla
chocolate
and
orange
peel
hides
the
10
2
alcohol
very
well
this
is
one
beer
that
is
definitely
worthy
of
all
the
hypeaccolades
it
has
received
very
smooth
and
extremely
complex
excellent
beer
mouthfeel
is
full
and
round
finish
is
clean
and
dry
aftertaste
is
slightly
sweet
beer
1100
on
my
personal
list
thanks
to
herbjones
for
this
one
not
my
favorte
beer
out
there
but
to
say
its
a
great
beer
is
an
understatement
a
nice
mohogany
color
which
light
does
shine
through
with
a
tannish
head
which
doesnt
last
long
but
does
leave
a
good
amount
of
lace
smells
well
some
spices
some
prunes
or
raisins
maybe
and
some
faint
sweet
citrus
a
lot
of
malt
hits
the
toungue
right
away
followed
by
some
dry
fruits
maybe
those
prunes
or
raisins
i
smelled
with
a
spice
hop
subtlety
at
the
end
paired
with
some
alchohol
only
one
word
desribes
the
mouthfeel
velvet
it
is
rich
and
smooth
great
beer
all
around
expensive
but
worth
it
a
great
beer
certainly
the
best
in
the
world
time
will
tell
first
aromas
are
full
of
sweet
carmel
sauce
rum
soaked
raisans
and
fruits
some
others
have
described
the
first
taste
it
as
bread
pudding
in
a
glass
thats
about
exactly
what
i
experienced
rich
full
array
of
flavors
rum
soaked
raisans
plums
cherries
and
sweet
cookie
dough
all
wrapped
up
with
a
carmel
sweet
cookie
snappy
alchohol
bite
some
peppery
fresh
hop
presence
just
for
a
second
hints
of
honey
and
freshly
toasted
grains
flavors
wash
and
soothe
your
tastebuds
into
submission
supersmooth
and
rich
perfectly
charged
eases
into
your
belly
with
a
nice
warming
touch
one
of
the
top
3
beers
i
have
had
easily
well
worth
the
wait
for
a
special
occasion
i
saved
this
one
since
last
winter
cheers
to
the
belgian
bum
for
this
treasure
i
was
actually
expecting
to
be
let
down
its
the
most
highly
anticipated
beer
i
ever
had
so
i
though
there
was
no
chance
it
would
be
as
good
as
others
have
claimed
ok
so
i
was
wrong
deep
garnet
color
with
a
long
lasting
had
fresh
plums
in
both
the
aroma
and
the
taste
also
hints
of
molassass
in
the
taste
the
level
of
complexity
is
unbelievable
this
beer
lives
up
to
its
expectations
and
thats
saying
a
lot
this
is
a
beer
i
searched
high
and
low
for
and
was
very
excited
to
finally
find
a
single
bottle
sitting
all
by
itself
at
a
local
liquor
store
the
flavor
is
exquisite
and
i
hope
to
find
another
bottle
soon
im
here
in
brazil
doing
some
field
work
for
herpetology
one
of
the
villages
i
cant
pronounce
the
name
yet
alone
spell
it
had
a
large
snake
roaming
around
my
friends
and
i
caught
it
and
relocated
it
one
of
the
villagers
offered
me
a
beer
as
a
reward
i
said
sure
expecting
some
corona
knockoff
it
was
this
oh
god
this
is
goooood
she
poured
this
into
a
fattened
wine
glass
i
dont
know
the
style
think
champagne
glass
big
enough
to
hold
about
a
pint
it
was
a
pleasant
ruddy
red
colour
big
head
that
needs
some
time
to
level
down
smelled
alot
of
raisins
complex
sugars
malt
a
little
alcohol
some
more
fruit
im
unsure
of
and
orange
peel
exceptional
taste
the
mixtures
of
fruit
gave
me
a
different
taste
every
sip
the
beer
was
served
a
little
warmer
than
usual
which
probably
made
it
better
beer
aroma
and
taste
are
more
pronounced
when
warm
and
this
is
a
very
complex
brew
medium
heavy
mouthfeel
only
drink
a
few
of
these
at
a
time
drink
it
too
enjoy
it
not
for
the
sake
of
drinking
pulled
out
my
new
maudite
glass
and
poured
it
nice
dark
amber
that
sported
a
thin
but
lasting
head
very
yeasty
nose
that
was
pleasant
to
smell
first
taste
was
new
to
the
tastbuds
almost
velvety
not
velveeta
on
the
tongue
great
aftertaste
i
bought
the
bottle
for
a
mere
6
99
since
it
has
been
talked
about
so
on
the
site
worth
every
penny
and
i
will
need
to
return
to
the
only
place
i
have
seen
it
in
nj
and
buy
some
more
lasting
impression
that
i
termed
great
belgian
on
steroids
to
my
wife
her
comments
were
different
and
interesting
she
likes
it
also

not
much
you
can
say
about
this
beer
that
already
hasnt
been
said
i
just
wish
i
lived
closer
to
westvletern
belgium
im
sure
you
can
get
it
alot
cheaper
than
the
8
50
that
i
had
to
pay
at
that
price
ill
just
save
drinking
this
wonderful
brew
for
a
special
occassion
monks
rule
overall
this
is
a
really
great
beer
although
i
feel
its
a
little
overrated
for
its
10
price
tag
ill
definately
have
it
again
and
recommend
giving
it
a
try
if
you
can
find
a
bottle
but
feel
that
there
are
other
beers
out
there
just
as
good
or
better
for
half
the
price
the
beer
is
a
brownishorange
color
theres
a
thin
head
at
first
and
a
thin
head
it
remains
lovely
aroma
it
manages
to
be
both
sweet
and
sour
at
the
same
time
tastes
great
very
complex
a
fantastic
beer
and
the
finish
is
nearperfect
smooth
and
clean
slightly
bitter
after
more
sips
ive
been
waiting
for
this
brew
and
it
was
well
worth
the
wait
poured
a
large
invigorating
longlasting
tan
head
with
finesmall
bubbles
there
was
good
lacing
on
the
sides
of
my
glass
this
brew
had
a
cloudy
brown
body
with
yeast
it
had
a
sweet
aroma
to
it
i
could
definitely
taste
the
alcohol
in
this
brew
and
was
it
ever
good
i
think
thedm
enjoyed
this
brew
just
about
as
much
as
i
did
what
do
you
say
thedm
i
held
a
special
party
for
this
one
i
invited
3
friends
and
hotstuff
to
join
me
in
a
little
westy
12
sampling
party
two
showed
up
and
the
third
gets
his
sample
tomorrow
as
well
as
2
other
coworkers
my
rating
this
brew
poured
a
medium
head
of
fine
to
medium
sized
light
brown
bubbles
and
a
cloudy
yeasty
semi
opaque
dark
brown
beautiful
body
the
aroma
was
its
weakest
point
as
it
was
only
a
sweet
mild
malt
aroma
i
would
have
expected
a
stronger
more
pleasant
aroma
for
a
higher
rating
it
has
a
very
complex
flavor
of
roasted
notes
as
well
as
spices
and
the
taste
that
a
high
alcohol
content
brings
to
a
great
brew
it
had
a
tingly
mouth
feel
in
its
finish
as
well
as
an
alcohol
taste
this
is
truly
a
brew
to
sip
and
enjoy
as
long
as
you
can
make
it
last
because
you
certainly
cant
get
too
many
of
these
especially
at
10
a
bottle
this
brew
has
to
rate
as
one
of
the
best
beers
available
it
is
truly
a
masterpiece
the
high
point
of
the
tasting
came
from
a
younger
gentleman
who
had
never
had
a
great
beer
before
he
rated
it
as
the
best
beer
he
had
ever
had
who
would
have
guessed
the
low
point
of
the
evening
was
when
the
host
offered
up
a
couple
of
more
beers
after
the
westys
sorry
to
say
he
had
miller
lights
in
the
fridge
gag
the
friends
rated
the
brew
as
8310416
and
659519
per
the
ratebeer
rating
system
they
did
truly
enjoy
the
brew
and
stated
that
it
was
probably
the
best
beer
they
had
ever
had
go
figure
its
not
quite
as
complex
as
i
was
expecting
but
its
an
outstanding
amazing
beer
as
it
warms
i
can
sometimes
pick
up
a
peppery
sensation
towards
the
middleback
of
the
tongue
the
sweet
component
begins
to
develop
a
licorice
bend
of
sorts
and
im
picking
up
other
tastes
but
either
they
are
too
faint
or
im
taking
too
long
to
identify
them
a
very
enjoyable
beer
well
worth
its
rank
status
i
may
have
to
go
down
to
party
source
and
drain
their
supply
thanks
to
sheepnutz
for
this
bottle
i
owe
you
a
couple
for
this
one
i
feel
like
i
just
drank
the
taste
equivalent
of
3
beers
poured
an
attractive
cola
brown
with
a
tight
fizzy
head
there
was
a
fair
amount
of
sediment
in
the
bottle
which
was
retained
by
leaving
a
bit
of
the
beer
unpoured
aroma
was
rum
soaked
chocolate
covered
cherries
flavor
was
mildly
phenolic
the
alcohol
creeping
in
around
the
edges
and
a
hint
of
burgundy
wine
i
kept
expecting
the
flavor
to
go
just
a
bit
deeper
but
it
never
developed
even
as
the
beer
warmed
quite
a
good
beer
but
not
head
and
shoulders
above
other
good
belgians
ive
had
certainly
a
beer
that
you
have
to
try
if
you
can
now
that
i
have
finally
downed
a
simple
sample
of
this
much
renowned
ale
i
can
only
say
more
please
a
rare
treat
brought
back
from
sams
in
chicago
by
trbeer
the
label
is
very
spartan
and
doesnt
advertise
the
mythical
qualities
of
this
beer
enjoyed
after
a
rochefort
10
this
is
a
special
occasion
late
night
on
a
rare
day
off
i
didnt
quite
get
any
special
aroma
until
i
inhaled
deeply
at
that
point
i
got
a
whiff
of
grapes
and
bubble
gum
maybe
this
is
unique
beer
in
botle
was
mpale
to
dark
brown
with
a
two
finger
head
flavor
is
of
grapes
roasted
caramel
a
sip
reveals
fruitiness
followed
by
bitterness
alcohol
taste
then
fizz
enjoying
very
late
2am
listening
to
some
techno
music
im
enjoying
this
more
than
the
rochefort
10
a
slight
bit
of
hops
bitterness
in
the
beer
which
is
nice
along
with
the
fruity
taste
drinkability
is
high
fairly
light
in
body
and
not
much
stinging
alcohol
will
i
ever
rate
a
perfect
5
0
beer
lets
see
when
i
let
the
other
bottle
cellar
for
some
time
i
had
this
fabulous
brew
in
a
11
2oz
bottle
poured
into
a
belgianstyle
glass
it
poured
a
deep
brown
with
lots
of
yeast
chunks
and
1
finger
of
head
there
is
a
good
amount
of
lacing
left
on
the
glass
the
smell
is
absolutely
awesome
sweet
and
roasted
very
complex
the
taste
has
everything
some
chocolate
some
fruit
sweetness
of
toffee
maybe
i
really
believe
that
my
palate
is
too
immature
to
really
understand
the
complexity
of
this
beer
the
mouthfeel
is
good
and
heavy
the
drinkability
is
a
little
low
due
to
the
11
but
this
really
is
a
worldclass
brew
what
could
be
better
frothy
head
beautiful
complex
flavor
the
high
alcohol
content
is
well
concealed
originally
sampled
14
march
2002
westvleteren
12
is
the
standard
that
all
must
measure
up
to
if
youve
not
had
it
go
out
of
your
way
to
find
it
its
beautiful
after
much
contemplation
on
whether
this
beer
was
worth
trying
based
on
its
cost
alone
i
decided
to
splurge
abt
12
pours
a
deep
mahogany
color
with
a
creamy
offwhite
head
the
head
retains
exceptionally
well
flecks
of
yeast
sediment
abound
in
the
dark
liquid
the
smell
is
a
bit
portlike
with
some
sweet
candy
present
in
the
aroma
as
well
the
taste
is
quite
strong
with
notes
of
candy
sugar
dates
dark
fruit
etc
all
making
equal
impressions
a
very
wellbalanced
brew
almost
every
sip
is
like
a
unique
experience
the
mouthfeel
is
wonderfully
smooth
albeit
a
little
less
carbonated
than
it
could
be
for
a
beer
of
10
2
abv
this
one
drinks
dangerously
easy
although
maybe
not
worth
the
price
for
a
single
bottle
this
is
nonetheless
an
excellent
creation
from
the
westvleteren
trappist
brothers
nectar
indeed
i
dont
see
how
any
beer
could
get
better
than
this
in
fact
i
may
change
my
rating
to
a
straight
5
later
let
me
think
it
over
a
little
this
is
it
with
out
a
doubt
the
best
beer
i
have
ever
had
it
just
edges
out
rochefort
10
by
a
whisker
although
i
have
never
tasted
them
sidebyside
dont
drink
this
cold
let
it
warm
up
a
bit
to
get
the
full
effect
of
the
aroma
and
flavors
makes
me
consider
moving
to
belgium
and
becoming
a
monk
the
beer
gods
have
smiled
down
upon
this
brewery
absolutely
the
most
satisfying
beer
that
i
have
ever
tasted
it
pours
a
dark
and
murky
brown
with
hints
of
red
and
an
impressively
large
head
that
dies
down
quickly
the
aroma
reminded
me
of
a
barley
wine
with
a
lot
of
fruity
scents
and
a
hint
of
alcohol
im
not
a
fan
of
barley
wines
so
i
was
hesitant
as
i
poured
the
aroma
strangely
filled
the
air
in
the
room
making
me
aware
of
the
aroma
from
about
three
feet
away
first
time
for
such
a
strong
aroma
the
flavor
was
incredibly
complex
the
flavor
is
so
incredibly
smooth
that
i
was
in
shock
considering
the
strong
aroma
i
think
i
notice
a
hint
of
chocolate
in
the
taste
as
well
as
some
different
fruits
and
a
couple
spices
the
mouthfeel
of
this
beer
is
extremely
smooth
and
satisfying
i
could
drink
this
beer
all
night
long
although
id
probably
not
last
more
than
three
because
of
the
alcohol
again
this
is
the
best
beer
ive
ever
had
and
i
would
recommend
it
to
anyone
regardless
of
the
8
per
bottle
price
i
could
easily
see
myself
drinking
this
again
and
again
and
considering
how
easy
this
one
is
to
drink
and
how
strong
it
is
that
could
be
a
very
dangerous
thing
a
huge
thank
you
to
aksmokedporter
for
snagging
the
sample
for
me
completely
on
his
own
whim
after
spotting
it
thats
a
great
beer
advocate
and
a
great
friend
a
truly
worthy
beer
for
my
100th
review
and
a
truly
amazing
beer
to
be
tasted
comments
flavors
were
very
well
blended
together
the
flavors
however
did
not
emerge
slowly
in
sequence
but
came
all
at
once
i
enjoyed
the
beer
but
there
are
others
i
like
better
that
have
at
least
from
what
i
perceive
a
more
multidimensional
flavor
profile
it
was
silky
in
the
mouth
carbonation
perfect
this
was
a
truly
great
beer
i
paid
11
39
for
11
2
oz
of
this
stuff
and
i
have
to
question
whether
the
expectation
this
price
creates
might
be
affecting
ratings
of
the
beer
dont
get
me
wrong
its
quite
good
the
pour
is
dark
ruby
with
a
thin
light
tan
head
lots
of
sediment
though
even
when
i
tried
to
pour
carefully
aroma
is
slightly
sweet
with
hints
of
plum
and
a
nutty
character
beer
has
a
smooth
body
with
a
light
fruity
malt
flavor
and
what
struck
me
as
a
very
noticeable
alcohol
character
malt
takes
on
a
slightly
toasty
character
midpalate
with
hints
of
toffee
and
the
beer
finishes
with
an
earthyherbal
and
very
wellblended
hop
flavor
finish
is
slightly
sugary
and
very
lightly
dry
good
stuff
and
well
worth
trying
but
other
examples
of
the
style
abbaye
des
rocs
comes
to
mind
provide
a
much
better
bang
for
the
buck
thanks
to
elguapo
for
so
generously
giving
me
a
bottle
of
this
wonderful
brew
when
i
randomly
showed
up
at
his
apartment
you
could
write
a
friggin
book
of
poetry
on
this
beer
thick
and
hazy
brown
is
the
color
huge
is
the
offwhite
head
and
pleasantly
fruity
is
the
aroma
no
single
flavor
jumps
out
at
me
there
is
some
major
complexity
in
there
while
staying
somewhat
mellow
all
around
its
a
warm
kind
of
mellow
a
fruity
mellow
the
alcohol
is
a
little
bit
noticeable
pretty
much
warm
really
body
is
medium
and
there
is
a
moderate
carbonation
feel
this
is
definitely
the
best
belgian
ale
i
have
had
to
date
i
cant
say
its
the
best
beer
overall
because
i
have
so
many
yet
to
try
anyone
who
is
a
broke
college
student
like
myself
well
you
should
still
come
up
with
8
for
a
bottle
of
this
you
wont
regret
it
what
a
great
way
to
spend
a
half
hour
sampled
my
first
yellow
cap
last
night
and
i
was
not
disappointed
this
ale
pours
with
a
silky
creamy
beige
head
sitting
on
top
of
beautifil
toffee
brown
body
belgian
lace
in
the
glass
as
you
drink
this
offering
is
evidence
of
the
excellent
head
reteniton
the
nose
is
very
malty
with
hints
of
prunes
and
toffee
the
taste
ahhh
the
taste
the
taste
is
robustly
malty
with
hints
of
raisin
caramel
toffee
and
chocolate
take
your
time
enjoying
yellow
cap
because
these
flavors
develop
as
the
beer
warms
in
your
hand
overall
the
taste
is
sweetly
malty
with
an
excellent
background
of
clove
spiciness
the
warming
alcohol
sensation
only
adds
to
the
character
of
this
ale
the
finish
is
dry
with
a
pleasant
caramel
aftertaste
a
well
balanced
and
well
crafted
ale
a
must
add
to
any
true
beer
lovers
collection
this
was
my
holy
grail
that
i
have
been
looking
for
and
praise
be
to
god
that
i
did
when
you
taste
something
like
this
you
gotta
feel
bad
for
the
southern
baptist
down
here
becuase
they
either
a
cant
drink
alcohol
or
b
can
drink
it
but
cant
tell
anyone
this
is
proof
that
it
is
great
to
be
a
catholic
at
least
something
good
has
come
from
it
lately
anyways
the
beer
is
a
cloudy
brown
color
and
had
a
light
brown
head
for
a
little
bit
its
smell
is
that
of
various
fruits
and
nuts
you
can
taste
a
hint
of
alcohol
but
it
smooths
out
quickly
the
aftertaste
is
very
smooth
and
also
tastes
quite
fruity
i
could
drink
this
all
day
and
night
but
its
kinda
on
the
high
side
for
price
i
guess
thats
the
only
drawback
for
it
though
aside
from
the
price
all
the
combinations
that
are
put
into
this
beer
truely
make
this
beer
a
heavenly
experience
praise
be
to
god
in
the
highest
f
i
would
highly
recommend
this
to
anyone
i
finally
got
my
hands
on
one
of
these
and
at
these
prices
one
is
all
i
should
have
this
beer
poured
a
very
dark
cloudy
amber
color
and
formed
a
light
tan
foamy
head
that
disappeared
quickly
leaving
some
circular
lace
an
aroma
of
alcohol
raisins
and
yeastgrains
a
flavor
of
malt
caramel
and
raisin
with
some
elements
of
spices
the
finish
is
creamy
and
a
touch
sweet
with
elements
of
the
alcohol
a
very
great
belgian
beer
but
will
need
to
try
some
others
to
see
if
this
is
really
the
best
out
there
a
wonderful
worldclass
brew
as
good
as
anything
ive
had
every
time
i
try
it
i
like
it
more
yes
its
quite
pricey
but
costs
the
same
as
just
a
fairly
good
bottle
of
wine
and
its
one
of
the
top
5
beers
in
the
world
probably
the
best
bodymouthfeel
of
any
beer
ive
had
creamy
smooth
deep
and
complex
fruity
perfect
balance
nothing
negative
to
say
if
i
could
get
this
close
to
home
id
have
it
at
least
once
a
week

good

it

i
had
high
expectations
for
this
beer
and
i
must
say
i
wasnt
dissapointed
at
all
it
is
deserving
of
its
reputation
this
is
a
worldclass
beer
that
must
be
experienced
by
every
beer
geek
find
it

it
love
it
this
bottle
gushed
upon
opening
and
was
furiously
overcarbonated
upon
pouring
the
brew

off

slowly
settles

retained

layer

the
beer
breathes

emerge
simultaneously
with
deeply
caramelized

dulls
the

a
bit
chewy
molasses
like
heavily
caramelized
dark
candi
sugar
sweetness
hits
the
tongue
at
first
sweetness
then
becomes
dark
fruit
like
in
nature
and
when
coupled
with
the
mellow

undertone
i
am
left
with
an
impression
of
chocolate

banana
esters

surface
along

overripe

a
true
dessert
in
a

w
a

slightly
syrupy

that
is
appropriate

the
high
strength

richness
finishes
caramelly

offset
by
dull
notes
of

dangerously
late
although
it
is
clear
that
my

didnt
travel
well
12
is
complex
and
robust
enough
to
prevent
the
oxidation
from
affecting
the
overall
aroma

significantly
delicious
i
will
search
out
another

400
one
of
the
best
dark
belgian
beers
ive
had
yet
it
was
perfect
pour
into
a
westvleteren
goblet
with
the
head
rising
to
the
top
of
the
glass
when
i
had
poured
all
but
the
last
ounce
leaving
the
yeast
behind
the
head
dissapated
to
about
a
quarter
inch
and
lasted
to
the
end
its
heavenly
dark
malty
body
is
offset
perfectly
by
the
tannish
head
smell
is
somewhat
weathish
with
a
slight
tinge
of
bananas
and
chocolate
went
down
smooth
and
creamy
with
chocolate
caramel
and
fruity
flavors
of
bananas
and
dates
first
few
sips
were
somewhat
crisp
and
dry
but
as
you
drank
more
it
became
sweeter
but
not
overly
sweet
and
the
fine
alcohol
flavors
became
more
pronounced
had
a
nice
floral
hop
flavor
and
there
wasnt
much
bitterness
just
enough
dryness
from
the
hops
and
alcohol
to
balance
the
sweet
malt
as
close
as
you
can
get
to
perfection
in
the
style
i
didnt
know
what
to
expect
with
this
brew
after
receiving
it
thanks
to
a
trade
from
a
gentleman
in
nyc
and
reading
many
reviews
of
it
i
think
it
was
a
little
too
cold
when
i
tried
it
as
the
taste
got
noticeably
better
as
i
moved
through
the
glass
now
about
the
taste
i
honestly
dont
think
my
palate
is
refined
enough
to
describe
accurately
what
is
going
on
here
this
will
be
one
i
have
to
try
again
around
beer
250
i
think
there
is
a
trail
mix
aroma
and
the
flavor
is
hard
to
pin
down
if
they
captured
this
flavor
in
a
cereal
i
would
get
up
earlier
every
day
hints
of
berries
grain
nuts
chocolate
like
willy
wonka
invented
it
i
tasted
something
different
with
every
sip
i
think
this
would
be
a
perfect
drink
with
some
godiva
chocolate
covered
strawberries
superb
pours
out
to
a
dark
almost
purple
color
in
the
glass
with
minimal
head
taste
is
that
of
a
spiced
fruit
very
winelike
in
character
and
finish
reminiscent
of
brandy
as
well
enjoyable
but
my
palate
didnt
find
it
to
be
the
best
beer
in
the
world
probably
the
best
beer
in
the
world
very
dark
the
color
of
a
raisin
black
except
at
the
right
angle
when
it
turns
a
deep
mahogany
brown
light
khaki
head
is
a
creamy
foam
that
is
longlasting
laces
the
glass
well
yeasty
caramel
on
the
nose
the
taste
is
vaguely
stoutlike
the
richness
of
the
flavor
is
very
nice
but
not
too
rich
to
make
it
hard
to
drink
caramel
spicy
yeast
and
wood
come
out
first
as
it
warms
more
coffeeish
flavor
and
some
lactic
characteristics
the
beer
manages
to
be
slightly
creamy
and
bright
on
the
palate
at
the
same
time
amazingly
easy
drinking
for
its
strength
yummmmm
this
beer
was
one
of
the
tastest
brews
i
have
ever
had
i
like
jasons
buckwheat
honey
aroma
comment
very
true
its
spicy
fruity
malty
chocolaty
flavor
smooth
texture
and
wonderful
aroma
there
are
few
that
rival
this
beer
i
had
one
last
night
as
desert
and
had
it
with
a
chocolate
macaroon
absolute
perfection
notes
so
damn
smooth
near
perfection
in
a
bottle
the
alcohol
at
its
strength
does
not
bring
down
the
drinkability
and
makes
this
beer
so
balanced
in
a
heavenly
way
that
it
is
devious
for
making
you
want
more
and
more
heavenly
i
took
my
reviewing
cap
off
for
this
one
and
just
simply
enjoyed
so
i
dont
have
a
lot
of
descriptives
here
but
i
recall
a
dominant
fruit
that
i
couldnt
quite
pinpoint
figs
and
an
overall
sweetish
finish
maybe
the
heavy
use
of
dark
candi
sugar
as
a
treat
every
now
and
again
its
worth
every
penny
it
drinks
like
a
champion
of
an
old
alebarleywine
i
have
to
get
more
quad
done
with
valerian
root
and
lemon
balm
a
nice
herbal
touch
to
a
peciuiarly
light
base
quad
cloudy
medium
amber
color
without
much
thickness
i
am
surprised
how
light
this
is
with
effervescent
carbonation
it
hardly
looks
like
a
quad
at
all
the
yeast
is
forward
in
the
nose
with
esters
of
pears
and
figs
and
raisins
as
well
as
a
green
tea
bitterness
likely
from
the
lemon
balm
the
flavor
is
the
same
as
the
nose
not
super
complex
or
evolving
but
extremely
different
from
what
we
generally
expect
in
a
quad
absent
is
the
dense
dark
sweet
grains
and
instead
there
is
an
herbal
springtime
lightness
to
it
that
aids
in
drinkability
i
would
never
in
a
million
years
guess
12
abv
for
this
beer
it
drinks
so
much
lighter
than
that
a
beer
that
probably
deserves
a
little
more
attention
on
our
shores
here
especially
considering
how
affordable
it
is
i
wish
for
more
body
out
of
a
quad
and
thats
the
part
that
really
threw
me
off
but
i
loved
the
bright
bubbles
and
the
dryness
on
the
finish
cool
use
of
these
botanicals
in
a
very
unique
beer
overall
4
0
a
unique
tasting
beer
and
i
do
not
mean
that
with
any
sarcasm
the
rooty
flavor
is
interesting
and
not
a
distraction
also
this
is
a
big
big
beer
and
it
is
a
credit
to
the
brewers
that
the
alcohol
is
successfully
hidden
and
the
focus
of
this
beer
is
on
taste
not
alcohol
consumption
recommended
if
you
can
find
it
there
are
certainly
better
quads
out
there
this
beer
has
the
right
notes
but
the
volume
has
been
turned
way
down
while
the
label
marks
it
as
an
ale
brewed
with
spices
these
flavors
are
lacking
or
hidden
by
the
alcohol
bite
o
not
what
i
think
of
with
a
quad
but
obviously
notable
for
other
reasons
curious
about
the
handling
and
age
of
the
bottle
othis
is
a
pretty
good
quad
with
a
unique
flavor
that
tends
toward
fruit
and
sugar
instead
of
fruit
spice
and
tobacco
flavors
the
high
abv
is
not
hidden
but
is
displayed
in
a
tasteful
manner
this
brew
doesnt
compare
with
my
favorite
quads
but
i
would
not
hesitate
to
drink
this
again
o
this
beer
is
very
easy
to
drink
considering
its
strength
because
the
alcohol
is
well
hidden
from
the
taste
overall
this
was
a
pretty
fun
considering
this
is
my
first
ten
year
old
beer
it
has
held
up
considerably
well
i
am
guessing
this
came
out
of
someones
rare
beer
collection
and
was
resold
review
from
72010
notes
poured
into
a
gulden
draak
tulip
pours
a
dark
orange
amber
with
a
slight
head
and
no
lacing
aroma
estery
and
boozy
flavor
of
brown
sugar
fruit
especially
orange
booze
odd
spicy
finish
mega
booze
interesting
flavors
but
not
at
all
balanced
and
the
alcohol
dominates
interesting
flavors
if
it
was
a
bit
more
balanced
o
a
solidly
made
well
constructed
drinkable
brew
where
this
quad
favors
the
lighter
and
brighter
balance
of
nuts
and
fruit
rather
than
the
more
chocolaty
and
richer
varieties
it
has
a
very
dry
and
warm
identity
that
should
settle
well
with
drinkers
of
cognac
and
brandy
cheers
drinkability
and
overall
impression
ive
enjoyed
drinking
this
one
and
despite
the
sweetness
here
it
hasnt
begun
to
cloy
by
the
end
and
so
remains
enjoyable
throughout
my
overall
impression
is
that
this
is
a
well
made
interesting
beer
that
is
not
quite
what
id
expected
but
that
has
a
lot
to
recommend
it
overall
this
is
a
tasty
beer
even
if
its
not
an
exemplary
quadrupel
it
is
quite
drinkable
for
its
abv
and
it
has
enough
going
on
to
be
interesting
if
not
necessarily
for
the
style
o
this
was
a
very
unique
quadrupel
in
fact
it
was
more
reminiscent
of
some
english
barleywines
than
many
belgian
quads
a
very
intriguing
and
often
overlooked
ale
served
from
bottle
into
a
trappistes
rochefort
chalice
poured
a
slightly
redorange
with
a
one
finger
offwhite
head
that
subsided
to
half
a
finger
very
slowly
maintained
decent
lacing
throughout
the
glass
the
aroma
was
comprised
of
sweet
malt
sugar
citrus
lemon
rine
and
dark
fruit
the
flavor
was
of
sweet
malt
dark
fruit
alcohol
sugar
citrus
lemon
rine
wheat
and
bread
it
had
a
medium
feel
on
the
palate
with
very
high
carbonation
ovearll
this
was
a
decent
brew
based
on
the
aroma
i
really
wasnt
expecting
much
from
this
brew
however
the
flavor
was
quite
complex
and
pretty
good
not
sure
how
the
citrus
aspect
was
supposed
to
tie
into
this
brew
but
it
didnt
kill
it
in
any
way
just
didnt
enhance
it
worth
trying
for
any
fan
of
the
style
o
i
cant
get
enough
by
far
my
favorite
quad
worth
seeking
out
jd
as
the
beer
warms
you
can
detect
a
slight
bit
of
the
alcohol
and
you
can
kinda
pick
out
some
earthy
hop
flavors
as
well
belgian
yeast
adds
some
decent
spice
qualities
i
had
this
on
tap
at
the
map
room
into
a
tulip
the
beer
pours
a
very
light
and
clear
maghonby
color
not
what
i
expect
when
im
drinking
a
quad
the
aroma
and
taste
are
not
what
i
was
expecting
either
when
i
think
quad
i
want
trappist
quad
not
this
it
has
quad
tendicies
you
can
smell
and
taste
all
the
inverted
sugar
here
but
not
any
notes
of
caramel
or
dark
fruits
overall
it
wasnt
what
i
was
expecting
aside
from
that
an
average
beer
on
its
own
merits
interesting
color
kind
of
a
deep
orange
mahogany
clear
through
the
pours
translucent
in
the
glass
sediment
on
the
bottom
yes
im
gonna
do
the
conditioned
stuff
sheets
of
pastel
off
orange
belgian
lacing
earthy
nose
that
hints
that
this
one
is
going
to
be
on
the
thin
side
raisin
figs
and
plum
a
little
booze
all
quite
nice
but
slightly
understated
the
flavor
matches
up
quite
nicely
with
the
nose
adequately
carbonated
the
mouth
feel
as
understated
as
the
nose
really
cant
believe
that
this
one
is
12
abv
drinkabilityyour
call
this
one
will
creep
up
and
bite
you
in
the
a
but
crazy
incognito
recommended
for
those
who
consider
themselves
quadnoisseurs
cheers
glad
to
find
this
one
at
premier
gourmet
in
buffalo
reviewed
from
my
notes
of
a
rare
cask
pour
at
the
lions
prides
belgian
beer
festival
this
cask
was
just
tapped
moments
before
i
was
served
a
glass
it
had
been
stored
in
a
cooler
so
it
was
at
a
lower
temperature
than
most
cask
beers
are
poured
it
has
a
beautiful
creamy
copperbrown
color
there
are
two
fingers
worth
of
white
foam
the
head
settled
slowly
to
an
even
skim
of
white
perfect
lace
was
left
behind
this
is
exactly
how
a
cask
beer
should
look
it
has
a
subtle
aroma
a
little
cidery
spicy
and
sweet
its
a
good
balance
of
the
strong
smells
you
get
from
a
quad
and
the
faint
smells
from
casked
beer
the
flavor
has
sweet
malts
up
front
with
some
crystal
sugar
and
a
slight
cider
taste
there
is
alcohol
and
pepper
in
the
finish
its
very
unique
and
tasty
it
has
a
lighter
medium
body
surprising
for
a
quad
but
right
in
line
with
a
lot
of
the
cask
beers
ive
tried
there
isnt
much
carbonation
but
more
than
other
casks
perhaps
keeping
the
cask
chilled
helped
with
this
the
beer
leaves
a
great
sweet
coating
on
my
tongue
there
are
plenty
of
alcohol
vapors
as
well
it
is
slightly
stickier
than
i
like
i
would
rate
it
a
4
25
if
i
could
this
is
supremely
drinkable
considering
the
strength
alcohol
and
spice
its
such
a
unique
beer
i
cant
really
say
if
it
exceeds
or
conforms
to
the
expectations
of
any
style
its
just
great
if
you
ever
see
the
bbb
on
cask
get
it
nice
beer
on
cask
mouthfeeldrinkability
the
texture
gets
better
throughout
the
tasting
going
from
prickly
to
a
more
foamy
rolling
carbonation
i
add
the
yeast
to
the
final
2oz
pour
and
the
edges
are
softened
along
with
the
alcohol
heat
an
interesting
enjoyable
belgian
quad
that
has
withstood
the
test
of
time
had
a
bottle
for
10
at
the
farmhouse
in
emmaus
pa
poured
murky
brown
with
a
short
tan
head
12
is
a
lot
for
a
belgian
and
it
shows
this
beer
is
more
barleywine
than
anything
though
the
belgian
influence
is
there
the
big
fig
and
cocoa
malt
flavor
are
certainly
rich
but
the
body
is
thin
and
dry
enough
like
a
good
quad
to
make
this
drinkable
and
avoid
a
syrupy
feeling
still
the
flavor
isnt
terribly
complex
id
call
this
more
of
a
strong
dark
as
it
doesnt
resemble
your
average
quad
very
bold
aroma
but
a
bit
lighter
in
the
taste
still
pretty
boozy
has
held
up
very
well
not
your
average
quad
d
easy
to
drink
and
a
fine
choice
to
christen
my
new
glass
the
alcohol
is
remarkably
well
hidden
and
could
have
been
a
problem
if
i
didnt
know
how
strong
it
was
something
ill
try
to
go
back
and
snatch
a
few
more
up
of
check
this
one
out
if
you
get
the
chance
interesting
beer
quite
good
for
a
belgian
quad
drinkability
isnt
too
high
even
though
it
was
a
pretty
enjoyable
experience
this
is
super
strong
and
while
the
abv
is
well
hidden
the
flavors
are
intense
and
its
not
something
youd
want
a
second
glass
of
even
if
you
really
enjoyed
the
first
while
far
from
pedestrian
i
thought
it
was
overall
of
average
quality
nice
sipper
i
didnt
really
expect
the
strong
citrus
flavors
in
this
beer
havent
quite
decided
if
i
like
this
one
or
not
but
it
surely
isnt
a
weekly
flavored
beer
really
need
to
find
a
big
bottle
of
this
and
give
it
a
further
more
intense
analysis
poured
a
dark
plum
color
with
a
slight
cream
colored
head
aroma
of
sweet
berries
balanced
out
by
a
nice
sour
scent
i
was
expecting
this
to
be
very
sour
but
was
surprised
by
the
nice
balance
of
dark
fruits
and
bitter
sourness
very
drinkable
enjoyable
beer
pours
a
hazy
chestnut
with
a
decent
head
that
mostly
fades
but
sticks
around
as
a
thin
swirly
cap
fruity
and
slightly
funky
with
persimmon
and
apricot
no
hint
of
the
bandaid
aroma
that
you
sometimes
get
with
this
brewery
the
taste
is
quite
a
bit
more
sour
but
with
more
sweet
persimmon
to
balance
the
the
flavors
a
touch
of
lemon
and
sweet
red
apple
rounds
it
out
quite
tame
and
smooth
for
the
style
and
the
alcohol
is
unbelieavably
well
hidden
nice
if
a
bit
on
the
soft
side
talk
about
from
one
extreme
to
another
the
beer
before
was
a
tropical
piss
and
now
this
age
a
small
wedge
of
world
champion
aged
gouda
to
set
my
mouth
up

a
hint
of
wet

nuts
and

cocoa
flavor
was
a
little
lighter
more
of
the
dark
ripe
fruits
some
yeast
and
honey
soft
body
with
a
bit
of
tang
from
carbonation
not
much
apparent
alcohol
surprisingly
not
the
heavy
hitter
i
wouldve
expected
either
great
beer
though
could
get
to
thinking
this
is
a
session
beer
only
to
get
carried
out
or
stumble
to
bed
d
excellant
for
a
quad
i
would
be
able
to
drink
two
of
these
and
enjoy
the
whole
ride
a
third
would
be
pushing
it
the
alcohol
is
also
a
factor
to
consider
at

i
never
could
have
guessed
from
the
cleanliness
of
the
finish
that
this
beer
apprached
anywhere
near
12abv
this
is
a
wellmasked
high
abv
quad
very
well
executed
d
the
abv
of
12
is
very
well
hidden
perhaps
to
much
so
very
sweet
and
a
very
good
try
this
is
a
nice
malty
belgian
whose
mouthfeel
feels
like
its
going
to
start
out
as
a
flemish
red
but
quickly
develops
into
heavy
malt
instead
of
sweetness
or
tartness
the
color
is
a
cloudy
amber
with
a
large
foamy
head
that
dissipates
into
lingering
lace
the
smell
makes
it
hard
to
pin
down
the
style
but
some
booziness
is
detectable
after
a
strong
whiff
i
think
this
would
be
best
with
some
sturdy
aromatic
type
of
food
like
blue
cheese
to
go
with
it
more
so
than
drinking
it
by
itself
poured
from
the
bottle
with
a
finger
of
head
which
was
gone
quickly
this
beer
had
a
light

color
smelled
like

initially
tasted
raisens

then
some

as
i
let
the
beer
sit
very
good
im
glad
i
was
able
to
sample
this
rather
rare
brew
edit
i
started
this
one
when
it
was
much
too
cold
the
medicinal
and
sour
flavors
mellow
a
bit
as
it
warms
while
the
alcohol
comes
to
the
front
making
for
a
more
whiskeybrandy
character
more
enjoyable
but
still
a
bit
raw
since
i
bought
it
in
chattanooga
in
a
liquor
store
so
i
suspect
it
has
had
plenty
of
time
on
the
shelf
to
age
if
not
in
the
best
conditions
drinkability
really
enjoyed
this
one
have
one
more
in
my
stash
think
i
will
age
it
for
a
few
more
years
to
see
how
it
fares
great
flavors
nice
cloudy
mahogany
color
aroma
and
flavor
are
pretty
much
identical
raisins
figs
dates
caramel
malts
and
spicy
alcohol
is
basically
undetectable
delicious
warming
and
fairly
complex
this
beer
is
a
real
treat
pick
up
a
few
if
you
can
find
it
very
drinkable
and
enjoyable
i
found
it
was
better
when
it
warmed
up
say
around
55
to
60
f
i
noticed
that
even
as
it
warmed
no
alcohol
showed
up
in
the
smell
or
taste
the
mouthfeel
is
rather
foamyfrothy
some
called
this
sour
i
do
not
agree
rather
smooth
for
a
strong
one
good
drinking
glad
to
have
had
the
opportunity
to
have
this
on
tap
overall
experience
i
had
this
beer
one
other
time
dont
remember
it
like
this
at
all
fuller
bodied
more
malt
presence
dark
caramel
notes
reminds
of
what
a
belgian
take
on
a
barleywine
would
be
like
alot
of
malt
fair
amount
of
yeastiness
a
little
spiciness
and
sit
back
and
enjoy
this
brew
has
been
available
in
boise
on
and
off
over
the
last
few
years
and
this
is
probably
my
45th
time
sampling
it
i
will
buy
it
again
but
sparingly
a
little
pricey
pours
a
clouded
dark
amber
brown
with
a
small
amount
of
tan
head
that
does
not
stay
around
too
long
nose
is
strong
with
raisins
and
a
bit
of
caramel
also
musty
tones
lingering
as
well
flavor
is
smooth
and
sweet
not
a
huge
range
of
character
but
still
well
made
the
alcohol
is
extremely
well
hidden
for
being
12
feel
is
the
expected
with
not
a
huge
amount
of
carbonation
definitely
drinkable
may
not
be
the
greatest
quad
ever
but
it
is
certainly
well
made
and
is
good
to
try
body
is
quite
big
with
active
carbonation
and
a
creamy
full
mouthfeel
i
like
the
addition
of
valerian
and
lemonbalm
although
i
cannot
taste
them
nice
and
worth
the
5
bucks
or
so
that
i
paid
for
this
overall
this
was
unique
and
wonderful
something
a
bit
different
that
i
really
was
not
expecting
but
that
was
a
wonderful
surprise
i
really
enjoyed
how
well
the
yeast
was
able
to
morph
into
different
flavors
as
the
temperature
changed
during
the
session
and
found
this
to
be
on
the
whole
very
warm
and
enjoyable
i
greatly
look
forward
to
trying
this
again
in
the
near
future
dthis
beer
has
some
nice
big
sweetness
with
a
nice
alcohol
finish
but
not
much
depth
in
the
flavor
the
plastic
note
as
a
bit
odd
but
the
rest
of
the
flavor
compensated
for
it
comment
i
love
quads
and
this
is
definitely
at
home
in
the
quad
family
however
for
a
belgium
quad
it
falls
short
of
some
of
its
trappist
cousins
as
well
as
short
by
a
long
shot
from
its
brother
from
the
same
brewery
10oz
glass
8
ontap
at
ebenezers
restaurant
and
pub
lovell
me
seems
to
be
quite
different
from
the
bottled
version
white
head
flavor
is
sweet
and
tart
with
a
nose
that
has
a
tartness
to
it
clean
finish
this
is
a
good
quad
but
im
not
tempted
to
wax
poetic
on
the
positive
side
of
the
ledger
its
one
of
the
more
drinkable
highabv
ales
that
youll
find
and
probably
ages
like
a
dream
this
bottle
is
at
least
one
year
old
perhaps
two
im
sure
they
have
no
interest
in
using
it
but
my
newly
created
motto
for
this
brewery
is
usually
good
always
interesting
bbbourgondier
is
both
drinkability
i
cant
honestly
recommend
this
one
at
all
the
words
stop
and
no
popup
in
my
mind
whenever
i
see
this
beer
in
stores
now
a
very
tasty
extremly
yeasty
and
dry
beer
with
an
attractive
orange
glow
a
firm
and
frothy
head
a
vibrant
almost
bursting
aroma
and
a
sticky
nearly
cloying
maltiness
yet
it
remains
extremely
soft
and
shows
the
delicacies
of
belgian
yeast
and
subtle
spicing
ive
never
given
a
beer
a
perfect
score
before
but
ill
be
damned
if
this
aint
one
of
the
best
beers
in
ebenezers
warming
smooth
and
this
beer
will
kick
your
ass
dark
rich
malty
with
the
12
abv
very
well
hidden
with
a
nice
sweet
balance
very
lightlty
hopped
this
is
a
very
big
beer
warning
this
will
kick
your
ass
highly
recommended
chris
highly
recommended
to
be
entirely
honest
i
dont
understand
why
this
beer
is
below
4
for
the
average
review
id
put
this
up
there
with
the
best
of
the
belgians
nice
chewy
mouthfeel
with
flavors
of
ripe
pear
dipped
in
caramel
warming
alcohol
appears
towards
the
finish
but
for
12
abv
it
is
masked
extremely
well
a
very
pleasant
easy
to
drink
enjoyable
quad
not
overly
complex
but
tasty
d
a
pleasing
quad
milder
than
some
but
its
flavors
are
nicely
balanced
the
alcohol
is
one
fo
the
main
flavors
but
it
astonishing
smooth
and
pleasant
worth
a
try
if
i
see
this
ontap
i
doubt
i
will
be
able
to
resist
generally
i
like
it
but
its
a
little
too
rich
for
my
blood
in
my
world
i
would
take
a
rochefort
or
something
else
first
but
this
is
good
enough
quite
drinkable
for
what
it
is
strange
and
wonderful
stuff
tmd
thick
and
sweet
the
sugars
and
fruitcherry
raisinand
plum
are
present
in
the
body
a
pungent
hop
alcohol
burst
right
before
the
finish
and
the
beer
lives
on
your
mouth
between
sips
there
is
a
really
unique
oily
lemony
finish
i
really
have
not
experienced
anything
quite
like
this
i
look
forward
to
trying
more
beers
from
this
brewer
the
amount
of
complexity
and
bouquet
of
flavors
and
aromas
made
this
beer
very
drinkable
having
me
look
forward
to
each
new
sip
this
was
an
outstanding
quad
at
the
top
with
rochefort
10
and
westy
12
im
off
to
the
store
to
stock
up
on
some
more
a
bit
expensive
but
worth
trying
for
sure
and
certainly
a
sweet
one
getting
warmer
as
we
go
along
almost
done
now
and
its
creeping
up
on
me
d
interesting
beer
more
like
a
dubbel
with
seasonings
than
a
quad
except
for
the
alcohol
content
this
one
would
develop
some
interesting
characteristics
with
a
few
years
of
age
not
sure
how
old
mine
was
great
beer
but
word
to
b
united
sort
the
label
out
its
bloody
naff
pours
a
deep
reddish
brown
and
in
a
tulip
glass
the
head
was
most
excelent
the
smell
was
sweet
with
lots
of
dark
fuits
dates
figs
raisins
and
good
belgian
ale
yeast
the
taste
was
very
malty
and
fruity
and
fairly
sweet
as
well
the
mouthfeel
was
slightly
syupy
with
slight
carbonatoin
and
the
alcohol
presence
was
masked
extremely
well
drinkability
was
low
only
because
this
is
a
sweet
thick
beer
with
lots
of
booze
in
it
drinkability
carbonation
i
have
had
tap
waer
with
more
carbonation
than
this
beer
flat
as
can
be
this
at
least
needs
a
little
something
d
very
smooth
easy
to
drink
lots
of
flavor
good
example
of
a
quadrupel
although
not
as
distinct
as
a
rochefort
10
or
a
westvleteren
12
not
too
shabby
but
there
are
plenty
of
brews
out
there
for
less
money
that
are
easier
to
get
a
hold
of
that
id
pick
before
this
one
this
came
highly
recommended
so
i
expected
a
lot
at
first
sight
yeck
not
a
pretty
beer
looks
like
muddy
water
however
looks
can
be
deceiving
so
ill
look
past
it
smell
is
raisins
sweet
alcoholic
raisins
taste
is
a
bit
less
intense
still
lots
of
alcoholic
raisins
but
not
as
overwhelming
sweet
a
bit
bready
mouthfeel
is
chewy
sudsy
more
bubbly
than
id
expect
for
such
a
high
alcohol
brew
overall
quite
drinkable
and
pretty
tasty
good
bang
for
your
buck
and
alcohol
is
waaaay
sneaky
this
is
good
but
would
probably
earn
a
better
score
from
me
in
the
winter
clear
mahogany
a
gentle
pour
producing
nothing
but
the
barest
wisp
of
head
minimal
aroma
requiring
me
to
stick
my
nose
in
the
glass
hot
fusel
alcohol
and
rum
soaked
fruit
maraschino
cherry
the
flavor
opens
with
huge
syrupy
sweetness
gooey
caramel
malt
suprersaturated
with
candi
sugar
hot
and
boozy
right
from
the
start
incredibly
sweet
with
that
lingering
saccharine
bite
in
the
end
id
say
its
cloying
super
fruity
and
packed
with
alcohol
like
cherry
syrup
cut
with
grain
alcohol
peppery
phenols
into
the
finish
mostly
overwhelmed
by
the
hot
hot
booze
very
little
carbonation
enhancing
the
massive
sweetness
and
slick
mouthfeel
crazy
and
hard
to
drink
i
feel
like
i
could
breathe
fire
drinkability
is
o
k
but
to
answer
the
question
of
would
i
have
another
probably
not
for
a
little
while
but
i
respect
this
beer
for
what
it
is
this
is
pretty
much
just
okay
to
me
straight
down
the
line
i
would
never
be
able
to
distinguish
it
from
a
thousand
other
belgians
drinkability
pretty
good
for
a
quadrupel
since
the
alcohol
is
not
overbearing
but
the
sweetness
may
get
old
after
a
glass
or
two
definitely
worth
trying
aroma
is
subdued
some
fruit
cake
spices
and
hint
of
sweet
malt
cloudy
brown
with
a
good
sized
creamy
tan
head
fore
is
malty
with
medium
cloverum
cake
spiciness
very
bready
with
a
sweet
spiced
pudding
finish
mild
bannana
flavors
develop
as
it
warms
nice
one
that
ill
have
again
and
again
and
again
and
again
notes
thanks
to
terry
boyd
on
his
recommendation
this
was
a
satisfying
beer
i
wish
i
could
have
another
but
ill
have
to
find
it
again
first
exceptional
an
enjoyable
beer
interesting
complexity
and
worth
a
try
the
colour
a
cloudy
juice
with
apple
and
pear
the
smell
a
yeasty
odour
with
booze
like
something
not
ready
to
serve
taste
and
mouthfeel
so
so
was
better
than
warmed
faintest
whisp
of
head
and
lace
low
carbonation
after
a
bit
of
pop
in
the
open
was
this
to
be
served
3
years
ago
or
needs
6
more
months
to
ferment
first
taste
brings
out
a
yeastmalt
profile
very
reminiscent
of
westvleteren
12
then
i
get
hit
with
spices

says
valerian
and
lemon
balm
berries
bananas
and
raisins
to
me
sweet
burnt
sugar
stille
nacht
comes
to
mind
in
the
aftertaste
funny
that
i
drank
it
out
of
a
st
bernardus
glass
this
beer
imitates
and
captures
certain
elements
of
all
these
big
belgians
well
done
clone
would
be
a
great
substitution
for
the
expensive
stuff
if
it
wasnt
expensive
itself
good
but
in
a
weird
place
ratingswise
the
beer
was
well
behaved
on
the
pour
with
a
little
head
and
a
malty
honey
alcohol
nose
it
is
a
dark
brown
opaque
ale
with
small
bubbles
that
just
looked
creamy
it
is
creamy
with
an
instant
alcohol
warmth
the
taste
is
surprisingly
light
and
dry
with
alcohol
dominating
the
palate
nice
sweetness
with
a
citrus
dryness
making
for
a
clean
finish
the
label
read
ale
with
spices
but
i
cant
taste
spices
other
than
coriander
is
a
minor
way
as
it
warms
the
flavors
come
together
better
but
this
may
need
a
year
or
three
to
mellow
it
also
is
a
bit
thin
pours
a
slight
murkycloudydirty
apricot
with
a
thick
guazey
white
head
i
seem
to
really
like
the
look
of
a
dirty
beer
smells
of
carameltoffee
malts
cardamom
licorice
and
big
spicy
medicinal
hops
almost
smells
like
an
english
barleywine
with
spices
big
malty
sweetness
with
stewed
fruit
cocktail
up
front
big
spicy
fennel
medicinal
warming
hops
and
alcohol
come
on
strong
and
remain
so
into
the
finish
too
cough
syrupy
and
with
the
fennely
spices
not
the
greatest
combination
cloying
and
syrupy
big
mouthfeel
nice
looking
and
smelling
but
taste
could
barely
finish
a
very
tasty
and
drinkable
beer
im
looking
forward
to
trying
other
beers
from
this
brewery
pours
a
very
murky
deep
amber
color
reminds
me
of
apple
cider
there
was
a
small
amout
of
sediment
or
crust
around
the
mouth
of
the
bottlethis
might
have
made
it
cloudier
then
it
should
be
nice

and

all
the
different

are

sweet
12
not
from
where
im
sittinghigh
abv
is
very
well
hidden
somewhat
spicy
very
full
bodya
damn
fine
beer
i
need
to
buy
more
then
one
next
time
or
see
if
it
comes
in
a
liter
size
well
worth
buying
this
beer
pours
a
dark
mirky
amber
color
the
smell
is
of
alcohol
and
the
ever
so
familiar
sweet
smell
that
comes
from
the
belgian
candy
sugar
that
i
assume
was
used
in
this
brew
it
resembles
raisins
or
dates
something
along
that
line
the
taste
is
sweet
honeylike
it
also
has
hints
of
dark
fruit
like
dates
raisins
and
alcohol
is
there
as
well
the
mouthfeel
is
smooth
it
has
the
perfect
amount
of
carbonation
for
the
amount
of
flavor
in
the
beer
it
is
a
very
drinkable
beer
but
how
many
of
these
can
one
actually
handle
drink
one
and
then
consider
switching
down
to
something
less
dangerous
i
would
definately
recommend
it
a
nice
beer
nothing
marvelous
but
not
bad
by
any
means
another
notch
on
the
belgium
post
and
grab
it
if
you
see
it
this
will
not
be
a
repeat
buy
for
me
as
it
cost
4
59
for
a
small
bottle
and
i
can
get
better
belgians
for
cheaper
i
had
to
check
the
ratings
before
i
rated
this
one
its
incredibly
low
carbonation
i
was
worried
with
the
very
weak
pfssht
on
cracking
the
cap
but
looking
at
the
ratings
here
its
either
an
incredibly
common
problem
for
this
beer
or
a
flaw
in
every
bottle
anyway
it
pours
a
cloudy
brown
the
aroma
has
a
nice
brown
sugar
and
honeydew
melon
fruitiness
the
flavor
adds
toast
and
a
touch
of
caramel
to
the
mix
this
would
probably
be
a
great
beer
if
they
pumped
up
the
carbonation
the
fact
i
could
drink
it
as
flat
as
it
was
says
something
about
it
mouthfeel
is
pretty
interesting
as
well
it
isnt
a
huge
beer
maybe
a
medium
body
at
best
w
very
little
carbonation
the
alcohol
and
hops
are
evident
and
leave
a
nice
warming
feeling
in
my
belly
great
winter
brew
i
think
the
swallow
is
nice
and
a
pretty
decent
aftertaste
as
well
this
is
proving
to
be
a
nice
find
in
ct
thanks
spence
id
recommend
it
if
you
can
get
your
hands
on
it
drinking
a
bottle
of
this
brew
at
room
temp
in
a
snifter
the
beer
pours
a
clear
mahogany
with
some
garnet
tints
the
bottom
of
the
bottle
releases
some
yeast
dredges
into

i
get
a
soft
fluffy
offwhite
head
of
about
5
cm
to
foam
up
aroma
is
dark
fruit
ripe
plums
raisins
and
cherries
dominate
but
i
also
detect
lemon
and
banana
as
well
actually
i
hint
of
nutmeg
perhaps
too
first
sip
reveals
a
thinner
body
than
expected
with
very
smooth
gentle
and
almost
nonexistent
carbonation
flavor
is
generally
sweet
with
ripe
fruit
coming
through
again
plums
and
prunes
mix
with
caramel
and
again
the
lemon
shows
up
i
get
a
bit
of
bitter

on
the

tasty
and
easy

very
annoying
and
removes
a
big
part
of
the
excitement
which
is
sad
because
there
is
a
nice
range
of
malt
flavors
and
no
yeasty
acidity
to
speak
of
still
i
dont
know
that
i
would
enjoy
this
all
that
much
as
sweet
as
it
is
and
with
nothing
to
counter
it
it
feels
like
a
fruity
sweet
full
bodied
red
wine
drinkability
is
average
at
best
beer
just
does
not
have
enough
to
get
past
lack
of
carbonation
and
a
real
direction
notes
of
raisins
minty
yeast
notesalcohol
evident
but
somehow
kept
in
the
background
even
at
12
chunky
malty
center
spicy
hoppyness
clears
things
out
for
a
long
and
complex
finish
get
out
the
stinky

and
crusty

this
is
a
hearty
brew
complex

strong

lovers
rejoice
pours
a

a
big

colored

from
a
snubnosed

particles
and
protein

good

sweet
caramelly
toffeelike
aromas
as
well
as
some
faint
old
ale
smells
like
straight
graininess
some
hops
and
fusel
alcohols
and
a
light
fruitiness
good
carbonation
which
helps
cut
the
high
alcohol
richly
sweet
subtly
grassy

botanical
and
lightly
tropical
in
its
starfruitlike
fruitiness
mild
spicing
evident
certainly
not
overwhelming
but
hard
to
decipher
any
specifics
this
beer
certainly
hides
its
boasty
12
abv
pretty
well
with
an
array
of
sensations
on
the
palate
but
note
it
is
an
asskicker
the
beer
after
its
escape
from
the
11
2
ounce
brown
bottle
sets
in
the
glass
a
smazy
brown
with
a
colossal
head
that
is
spumous
in
texture
and
the
color
a
toothsome
tan
the
resultant
lace
forms
a
glutinous
blanket
to
obscure
the
glass
nose
is
that
of
very
ripe
plums
hints
of
yeast
and
a
bit
of
fusel
alcohol
start
is
sweet
and
thick
with
malt
top
id
moderate
to
full
in
its
feel
upon
the
palate
finish
has
a
staunch
acidity
the
hops
pounce
on
your
palate
along
with
the
12
percent
abv
to
make
it
spicy
aftertaste
quite
dry
and
long
lasting
a
quite
decent
beer
flavors
of
bananas
cinnamon
brown
sugar
caramel
fruit
pectin
gold
raisins
with
an
alcohol
bite
a
taste
balanced
between
2
extremes
sweetness
and
alcohol
with
everlasting
carbonation
the
alcohol
bite
is
not
so
much
that
it
would
put
you
off
though
its
more
of
a
compliment
to
the
sweetness
than
anything
this
beer
made
the
hair
on
my
forearms
stand
up
not
a
cheap
beer
this
stuff
is
worth
the
price
though
11
2
ounce
bottle
the
12
abv
is
nearly
completely
hidden
in
this
beer
especially
compared
to
other
such
large
beers
absolutely
a
delight
to
drink
i
think
this
is
kind
of
an
easy
but
pleasant
belgian
it
has
a
creamy
flavour
fruity
the
taste
is
even
too
fruity
maybe
raisin
the
hop
is
present
in
the
carpet
of
flavour
the
beer
is
unbalanced
to
the
sweet
the
bitter
is
noticeable
just
in
the
aftertaste
ive
tryed
this
beer
on
tap
at
the
24
hour
of
antwerpen
last
year
and
i
remember
it
very
different
and
much
better
maybe
it
is
the
bottle
overall
an
excellent
offering
from
victory
i
didnt
share
very
good
flavor
light
and
fruity
like
others
have
said
i
didnt
taste
any
banana
very
drinkable
with
no
alcohol
taste
but
with
12
abv
it
sneaks
up
on
you
pretty
quick
at
7
99
a
bottle
its
a
great
deal
if
you
are
looking
for
a
quadruple
the
best
around
for
the
price
not
a
huge
fan
of
quadruple
ales
feels
like
more
of
a
wine
vs
beer
but
have
had
a
couple
of
these
and
as
always
share
with
a
friend
drink
a
whole
bomber
on
your
own
and
pay
the
price
presentation

this
is
a
nice
domestic
take
on
a
quad
rich
and
complex
the
hops
were
a
bit
of
a
surprise
but
this
is
a
halfyear
old
bottle
and
they
may
have
faded
a
bit
which
is
fine
because
their
presence
like
some
of
the
other
flavors
is
deftly
integrated
into
the
whole
very
nice
victory
seems
to
be
poorly
distributed
to
washington
now
and
i
was
lucky
to
pick
up
this
bottle
from
a
store
i
know
handles
beer
well
glad
i
got
the
last
bottle
if
i
see
it
again
i
will
cellar
some
this
has
potential
for
a
few
years
of
interesting
change
overall
solid
decent
beer
so
good
to
slow
roll
its
a
new
beer
in
every
5
degree
increment
the
lack
of
the
unpleasant
yeast
might
even
win
over
english
bw
lovers
overall
victory
rarely
makes
a
bad
beer
this
one
is
top
notch
mouthfeel
is
medium
a
little
slick
overall
pretty
good
had
my
first
one
of
these
yesterday
it
was
exceptional
especially
for
the
cost
i
am
a
huge
fan
of
quads
this
might
not
be
as
complex
as
some
of
the
big
belgians
but
still
quite
enjoyable
i
poured
it
into
my
st
bernardus
goblet
nice
opaque
dark
straw
color
felt
great
on
the
tongue
light
on
the
carbonation
not
as
much
alcohol
burn
as
one
would
expect
from
a
12
abv
overall
very
impressive
i
already
picked
up
two
more
bombers
delicious
quad
the
most
outstanding
for
me
was
the
mouthfeel
quite
enjoyable
thick
delicate
but
also
not
too
over
powering
the
alcohol
was
present
but
not
what
i
expected
out
of
a
12
for
the
price
7
99
here
this
quad
is
absolutely
going
to
become
one
of
my
favorites
worth
a
try
if
youre
a
fan
of
this
style
opened
this
with
three
pther
people
we
all
felt
like
this
needed
more
time
too
yeasty
or
bretty
it
just
didnt

think
that
it
is

very
nice
take
on
a
belgian
12abv
doesnt
taste
like
12abv
which
is
nice
could
get
you
in
trouble
if
you
arent
careful
the
aroma
sets
up
heavy
but
the
taste
is
smooth
and
the
feel
is
nice
upon
the
tongue
victory
is
a
very
good
brewery
that
continues
to
send
quality
beers
this
is
one
of
their
best
this
is
a
fantastic
quad
id
rate
it
higher
but
it
is
a
bit
hoppier
than
id
expect
from
the
style
id
rate
it
lower
except
the
hops
really
compliment
the
flavor
this
is
a
phenomenal
take
on
the
style
it
has
a
great
caramel
earthiness
up
front
a
slight
hop
twang
on
the
finish
and
just
enough
alcohol
warmth
going
down
to
remind
you
to
be
careful
and
just
enough
awesomeness
to
make
you
want
to
throw
caution
to
the
wind
which
advice
will
win
out
only
the
rest
of
the
evening
will
tell
in
terms
of
appearance
this
beer
lacks
any
head
that
lasts
longer
than
30
seconds
and
produces
absolutely
no
lacing
the
golden
amber
color
however
is
simply
beautiful
i
cannot
detect
any
aroma
whatsoever
but
at
least
it
doesnt
smell
bad
in
terms
of
flavor
only
the
sweetness
of
candi
sugar
is
noticeable
no
caramel
no
figs
no
dates
no
raisins
no
alcohol
just
sweet
no
hops
no
malt
no
diacetyl
the
palate
is
decent
i
last
had
this
beer
in
2008
and
cant
see
where
its
changed
whatever
i
paid
for
this
bomber
was
too
much
for
a
beer
thats
meh
at
best
overall
this
is
a
nice
rendition
of
what
i
would
consider
a
belgian
quad
i
suspect
that
laying
this
down
for
a
few
years
would
only
enhance
this
brew
45
excellent
bspa
very
worthy
of
cellaring
o
this
was
indeed
a
good
one
to
put
away
wow
huge
dark
fruit
character
with
drinkability
sumptuous
and
decadent
but
not
over
the
top
wonderful
i
wish
i
had
bought
more
overall
this
is
a
solid
american
interpretation
of
the
classic
belgian
style
this
is
a
definite
goto
with
rich
food
the
best
american
made
quad
ive
had
another
great
one
from
victory
oactually
this
is
an
okay
quad
im
fairly
impressed
by
it
its
definitely
different
from
any
other
quad
ive
had
but
it
works
in
its
own
subtle
way
an
interesting
beer
but
i
think
its
a
stretch
to
call
this
a
quad
it
almost
tastes
more
like
a
farmhouse
beer
i
would
actually
consider
this
more
of
a
strong
saison
than
a
quad
ad
the
look
and
profile
of
a
true
quad
are
missing
here
still
its
a
decent
beer
one
i
felt
was
worth
trying
once
had
this
beer
many
times
and
am
a
big
fan
bought
quite
a
few
to
stick
in
the
basement
and
wanted
to
do
a
full
review
to
see
if
it
can
hold
its
rating
great
looking
beer
with
an
outstanding
smell
very
tasty
and
remarkably
easy
to
drink
for
something
that
weighs
in
at
12
big
bonus
points
there
victory
hit
a
home
run
on
this
one
outstanding
beer
that
presents
a
very
good
value
i
am
sure
i
will
buy
again
not
your
average
quad
better
than
youd
expect
o
guess
it
would
have
been
better
if
i
went
in
knowing
it
was
a
hopped
up
version
of
a
quad
i
like
ipas
and
black
ipas
on
occasion
but
they
are
not
my
regular
choice
because
im
not
a
hugh
hop
fan
especially
mixed
with
my
other
styles
i
did
mark
it
lower
just
because
it
is
not
really
a
quad
but
i
guess
more
like
a
american
quad
due
to
the
friggin
dosage
of
hops
very
nice
drinking
beer
easy
to
put
down
and
pick
back
up
again
very
different
from
other
belgian
quadruples
on
the
market
i
really
enjoyed
this
little
gem
i
picked
up
in
a
750
corked
bottle
from
the
local
craft
beer
store
it
has
great
drinkability
and
a
high
abv
it
has
strong
belgian
yeast
characteristics
with
tastes
of
clove
and
coriander
i
enjoyed
it
in
a
stemmed
glass
and
observed
a
nice
thick
head
that
accented
the
taste
perfectly
i
will
be
comparing
all
belgian
strong
ales
i
drink
in
the
future
with
similar
characteristics
to
this
beer
overall
a
borderline
great
quad
definitely
a
good
value
a
little
more
complexity
would
go
a
long
way
victory
please
approach
this
style
with
a
modicum
of
respect
please
this
is
an
exceptional
beer
worthy
of
stocking
up
on
this
beer
is
one
to
be
savored
during
special
events
i
imagine
myself
on
xmas
eve
sipping
on
this
next
to
a
warm
fire
as
the
rest
of
the
world
goes
to
bed
and
i
drift
off
in
my
chair
kinda
like
the
sleepytime
tea
box
exceptional
stuff
very
highly
recommended
overall
a
pretty
solid
american
take
on
a
quadbelgian
strong
ale
nice
caramel
and
fruit
notes
a
little
more
hoppy
than
usual
for
the
style
but
it
adds
a
nice
twist
o
not
quite
a
quadruple
in
my
opinion
i
would
like
some
more
dark
fruit
a
solid
belgium
ale
on
the
sweet
side
i
made
two
attempts
to
try
this
beer
each
time
it
was
a
750ml
bottle
with
a
cork
both
times
the
cork
broke
in
half
the
first
time
i
used
a
cork
screw
to
try
and
get
the
remaining
cork
out
of
the
bottle
the
lip
of
the
bottle
burst
under
the
slightest
pressure
the
second
time
i
managed
to
get
the
cork
out
the
beer
tasted
like
a
stew
of
dirty
mop
water
mixed
with
old
garbage
it
was
honestly
awful
vtwelves
look
marries
auburn
and
toasted
orange
hues
with
a
thin
ring
of
offwhite
head
not
a
bad
look
at
all
the
aroma
is
very
fruity
with
pineapple
and
apricot
being
dominant
i
also
quite
strongly
pick
up
what
i
perceive
to
be
citrusy
hops
here
the
taste
is
actually
more
balanced
than
the
aroma
suggests
with
belgian
yeast
and
lots
of
candied
fruit
esters
mingling
with
one
another
the
finish
leaves
a
syrupy
taste
in
my
mouth
which
is
borderline
too
much
overall
i
think
this
belgian
inspired
ale
is
good
but
can
benefit
a
lot
by
resting
it
for
a
year
or
more
o
interesting
take
on
the
style
and
not
quite
what
i
expected
i
would
definitely
like
more
malt
complexity
and
more
of
those
belgian
yeast
aromatics
this
reminds
me
almost
of
a
double
bock
o
quite
good
but
there
are
definitely
better
versions
of
the
style
pairs
decently
with
havarti
o
this
is
a
pretty
enjoyable
beer
but
like
most
american
versions
it
pales
in
comparison
to
the
original
belgian
products
worth
a
try
but
for
nearly
the
same
price
you
can
get
abt
12
which
is
on
a
whole
different
level
than
is
one
the
beer
pours
a
surprisingly
light
and
foamy
white
head
that
dissipates
very
quickly
the
beer
itself
is
a
dark
honey
color
with
shades
of
brown
and
dark
orange
the
beer
smell
has
strong
notes
of
honey
with
dark
fruits
and
very
sweet
malts
the
malts
give
off
a
very
sweet
and
caramel
smell
the
smell
also
has
slight
notes
of
alcohol
the
beer
taste
has
similar
fruity
sweet
and
caramel
notes
with
a
slight
hint
of
honey
the
taste
and
smell
are
very
reminiscent
of
a
barley
wine
more
so
than
a
quad
the
feel
is
fairly
silky
and
smooth
with
very
little
carbonation
overall
a
pretty
good
beer
b
i
really
enjoyed
this
brew
allot
not
like
anything
i
have
had
before
start
off
sweet
then
the
hops
hit
with
a
dry
finish
a
very
well
done
beer
cheers
drink
slowly
overall
definately
a
beer
to
enjoy
amongst
friends
in
small
quantities
for
an
after
dinner
digestive
or
for
celebration
not
something
i
would
drink
to
unwind
at
the
end
of
a
long
day
i
enjoyed
it
a
nice
quad
but
nothing
extraordinarily
complex
or
intriguing
i
didnt
think
it
pours
a
sexy
amber
redish
orange
color
maybe
a
little
darker
than
that
sounds
with
a
prominent
white
head
that
slowly
settles
the
nose
is
big
on
this
beer
dried
cherries
and
alcohol
right
away
some
warmer
molasses
notes
also
trickle
in
above
a
sizable
grain
bill
the
flavor
is
heavy
on
the
dark
fruits
raisins
and
plums
join
the
party
but
the
alcohol
wipes
out
some
of
the
subtleties
lots
of
burn
in
the
finish
which
is
also
very
sweet
caramel
based
and
maybe
a
little
overdone
belgian
yeast
provides
lovely
carbonation
but
there
just
isnt
quite
enough
body
for
me
here
also
the
teeth
rotting
sugar
finish
is
even
more
than
the
style
calls
for
this
is
an
absolute
must
share
bottle
of
beer
even
with
one
friend
we
struggled
with
the
last
of
it
a
quality
quad
especially
if
you
like
yours
sweeter
and
stronger
than
the
standard
issue
fruity
sweetness
and
toasted
grain
off
the
bat
tropical
fruit
candied
pears
and
banana
rum
fill
in
sweet
but
not
cloying
herbal
spicy
peppery
bitterness
weaves
in
and
out
providing
some
balance
might
be
due
to
the
alcohol
notes
of
caramel
sweet
bread
and
honey
come
out
midpalate
rummy
fruits
into
a
warming
finish
postbanana
bitterness
spreads
peppered
by
the
peppery
spicy
alcohol
yeasty
too
fullbodied
with
a
subdued
smooth
bottleconditioned
feel
a
very
nice
sipper
o
this
was
a
solid
choice
its
nothing
spectacular
but
it
is
one
of
victorys
better
brews
othis
bottle
had
some
aged
on
it
still
good
though
but
it
didnt
seem
all
together
maybe
ill
give
it
another
go
fresh
but
very
meh
o
a
very
nicely
done
american
quad
with
good
complexity
and
depth
not
as
many
layers
as
some
of
the
european
counterparts
but
still
up
there
in
terms
of
quality
fairly
damn
cheap
for
what
it
is
too
6
for
a
750
of
12
american
quad
nicely
done
victory
o
this
is
a
nice
quad
i
dont
say
this
often
but
this
beer
is
just
a
bit
too
sweet
i
can
see
this
beer
doing
well
aged
in
a
wine
barrel
keep
in
mind
my
bottle
is
almost
2
years
old
in
style
4
25
overall
this
quad
is
awesome
and
i
got
it
for
7
50
for
the
bottle
gotta
be
dumb
not
to
pick
it
up
for
that
price
overall
this
was
a
really
good
beer
nice
flavor
and
very
well
balanced
o
this
is
a
very
flavorful
and
intense
beer
every
sip
brings
out
a
different
flavor
for
me
and
it
was
an
great
beer
to
sip
on
not
one
to
double
fist
with
cheers
good
not
must
try
overall
a
nice
sweet
and
fruity
quad
that
even
at
12
abv
is
very
drinkable
with
very
little
boozy
taste
influence
a
good
beer
to
try
if
you
get
the
opportunity
btw
this
was
my
first
review
so
hope
you
guys
think
i
did
an
alright
job
lol
this
is
a
beer
that
i
rated
a
4
in
every
category
except
for
the
overall
i
felt
is
was
a
4
5
so
i
guess
this
is
one
of
those
times
when
the
whole
is
greater
than
the
sum
of
its
parts
750ml

the

a
dull

hue
with
a
slightly
hazy

head
is
half
an

and
frothy
nose
expresses
overripe
figs
caramel

and
a
spicy

taste
follows

however
candi
sugar
is
also
present
as
well
as
a
fermented
quality
to
the
dark

finish

a
hint
of
ethanol
mouthfeel
is
mediumlight
with
a
carbonation
that
falls
just
short
of
lively
and
a
slightly
crisp
finish
overall
i
have
to
say
that
this
beer
seems
closer
to
a
tripel
in
character
than
a
quad
theres
definitely
an
alcohol
presence
but
its
extremely
wellhidden
at
12
i
think
this
beer
might
be
worth
cellaring
for
another
year
or
two
to
see
how
it
opens
up
i
dont
mean
any
disrespect
but
i
always
felt
like
there
was
a
reason
that
i
hadnt
bought
and
tried
this
sooner
ive
seen
it
on
the
shelves
for
years
now
never
gave
victory
a
chance
in
this
style
and
as
it
is
i
could
pass
on
it
in
the
future
a
decent
belgian
ale
lighter
in
color
than
most
quads
sweet
but
roasty
i
always
succumb
to
the
real
belgians
here
though
poured
at
37f
from
a
750ml
bomber
into
a
duvel
goblet

unclarified
dark
amber
honey
nonpersistent
1
finger
head
vigorously
poured
warm
sweet
smell
of
no
kidding
nitrous
oxide
and
slight
booziness
at
least
when
i
was
a
kid
this
is
what
nitrous
oxide
smelled
like
when
i
was
getting
teeth
pulled
not
sure
if
it
actually
has
a
smell
or
not
what
a
grand
and
warm
taste
this
delicacy
has
flavor
is
warm
and
inviting
with
caramel
tops
and
a
cherryish
reminiscence
or
maybe
sweet
southern
barbecue
that
rolls
around
the
edge
of
the
back
half
of
your
tongue
on
finish
the
booziness
enhances
this
lovely
combination
the
justabovenonexistent
carbonation
makes
this
fine
sipping
brew
whose
complex
flavors
beg
for
sipping
and
resipping
hard
to
call
13
for
a
bomber
snooty
but
this
is
dang
fine
ale
note
to
self
buy
whenever
you
can
nice
beer
o
this
is
a
great
quad
super
malty
and
sweet
without
being
cloying
fruit
helps
break
up
the
sweetness
a
bit
and
the
heatspiciness
does
a
great
job
too
while
adding
extra
complexity
a
well
done
quad
very
easy
drinking
despite
the
high
abv
o
nice
quad
to
drink
in
the
summertime
given
its
citrus
and
floral
notes
im
usually
not
the
biggest
fan
of
quads
but
enjoyed
this
one
a
fair
amount
recommended
if
you
see
it
reddish
brown
with
a
finger
or
two
of
white
head
moderate
retention
light

nose
has
some
candy
sugar
candy

mild
dark

light

and
some

zest
comes
through
as
it
warms
taste
is
quite
sweet
candy
sugar
some
grapes
ripe
plums
almost
a
bit
of
wheat
flavour
spice
and
alcohol
in
the
finish
medium
full
body
and
a
lower
medium
carbonation
a
nice
paler
quad
good
flavour
and
alcohol
although
there
isnt
as
pronounced
as
i
thought
it
would
be
the
mouthfeel
is
leaning
towards
the
heavier
side
with
carbonation
being
a
little
above
average
overall
its
a
pretty
good
beer
the
tart
crisp
fruits
did
seem
a
little
overdone
at
times
for
the
style
pretty
enjoyable
beer
to
sip
on
this
evening
though
fullbodied
with
a
light
effervescence
and
smooth
as
silk
warming
as
a
12
should
be
a
really
good
beer
original
review
on
08012010
i
voted
for
the
beer
in
this
pairing
with
the
food
the
general
concensus
was
that
the
beer
was
better
than
the
wine
with
this
dessert
this
left
the
dinner
with
a
22
tie
between
the
beer
and
wine
looks
like
there
will
have
to
be
another
to
settle
it
once
and
for
all
o
this
started
to
grate
on
me
the
further
i
got
into
my
session
and
its
a
true
endurance
test
for
sure
however
that
doesnt
mean
i
didnt
think
it
is
a
great
beer
for
8
99
you
could
do
much
much
worse
medium
bodied
syrupy
plenty
of
carbonation
and
a
lot
of
alcohol
taste
this
bottle
may
have
been
better
if
i
put
it
in
the
cellar
for
a
while
doesnt
really
taste
or
look
exactly
like
a
quadrupel
but
not
too
bad
i
really
like
this
unique
take
on
the
strong
belgian
style
the
sugars
are
rich
and
complex
the
fruit
suitable
and
the
rest
of
the
beer
nice
o
surprisingly
this
is
kind
of
a
simple
beer
only
after
id
opened
it
did
i
read
the
label
and
see
that
they
said
you
should
really
age
it
up
to
five
years
this
ones
only
10
months
old
drat
wish
i
had
aged
it
because
this
wants
more
complexity
doesnt
really
seem
like
a
quad
but
that
could
be
because
my
quad
experience
is
limited
to
the
abt
style
i
was
expecting
dark
and
malty
its
enjoyable
and
very
drinkable
particularly
despite
the
strength
what
its
not
is
interesting
i
would
not
spend
money
to
drink
another
unaged
one
really
enjoyed
it
despite
not
being
able
to
walk
for
45
min
after
overall
i
would
not
consider
a
quad
not
enough
dark
malt
taste
to
thin
not
smooth
enough
a
bit
hot
lets
see
how
my
other
bottles
age
o
im
new
to
reviewing
beers
but
i
think
i
can
safely
say
that
this
is
one
of
those
beers
that
you
should
try
and
then
get
another
to
cellar
i
believe
that
boozy
aroma
and
hotness
will
fade
a
bit
and
those
dark
fruits
spices
and
orange
peel
flavors
will
come
out
plenty
tasty
drinkable
and
eager
to
store
one
really
good
beer
here
great
for
splitting
with
someone
and
admiring
its
qualities
wish
i
had
the
smarts
to
buy
another
one
or
the
patience
to
let
it
age
a
bit
im
willing
to
bet
that
this
one
would
be
fantastic
and
a
little
more
subdued
in
about
3
years
but
definitely
worth
picking
up
if
you
see
it
this
definitely
isnt
a
belgian
quad
but
it
is
good
for
12
abv
more
of
a
belgian
strong
pale
ale
does
pretty
good
as
a
belgian
style
none
the
less
alcohol
is
way
hidden
with
such
subdued
flavors
not
bad
i
dont
believe
this
to
be
a
quad
but
it
is
good
reviewed
blind
as
part
of
blind
bif
6
it
pours
a
clear
copper
topped
by
a
frothy
couple
o
fingers
of
dusty
creamwhiteness
the
nose
comprises
light
melon
tart
orange
lemon
zest
light
white
grape
a
touch
of
pine
needle
light
honey
and
theres
a
vague
notion
of
brettlike
funkiness
in
there
as
well
the
taste
holds
notes
of
rich
caramel
pine
resin
some
sense
of
menthol
honey
and
something
akin
to
thick
spicy
wine
grapes
imagine
a
nice
px
sherry
made
with
chardonnay
grapes
or
something
its
like
an
overt
combination
of
sweet
and
piny
with
neither
side
knowing
when
to
back
off
always
escalating
and
exacerbating
every
possible
circumstance
if
the
world
were
run
like
this
it
would
consist
of
literal
dust
caught
in
the
threads
of
the
cosmic
tapestry
the
body
is
a
stolid
medium
with
a
very
light
moderate
carbonation
a
syrupy
feel
and
a
sortakinda
dry
finish
overall
i
thought
this
was
a
pretty
sad
excuse
for
a
quad
one
that
laughed
in
the
face
of
a
usually
tasty
style
making
everyone
involved
feel
all
the
worse
for
the
experience
overall
this
is
a
flavorful
brew
with
a
sweetness
that
most
will
enjoy
i
like
the
unique
yeast
taste
this
has
and
i
recommend
trying
it
if
you
havent
already
i
am
curious
to
see
how
a
few
bottles
age
because
they
are
great
with
8
months
on
them
b
3
83
oa
nice
sipping
quad
with
good
balance
and
flavor
well
this
was
my
1st
quad
and
i
am
guessing
quad
are
not
for
my
palate
i
struggled
to
split
my
13
of
a
22ozer
way
way
too
much
beer
for
me
this
one
bordered
on
hard
alcohol
in
my
estimation
if
you
like
quads
perhaps
victory
has
nailed
the
taste
with
this
twelve
but
overall
it
left
me
wondering
howwhy
does
anyone
drink
this
kind
of
beer
o
mmm
tasty
when
all
is
said
and
done
i
have
to
knock
this
beer
down
because
its
still
a
little
too
hot
but
i
would
love
to
get
my
hands
on
another
bottle
to
sit
on
kudos
to
victory
o
one
of
the
boozier
beers
i
have
had
but
overall
still
a
pleasant
beer
o
12
oz
is
plenty
for
an
enjoyable
drinking
experience
easy
to
take
a
nice
hefty
delicious
swig
to
take
in
all
the
flavors
and
then
come
back
to
it
a
warm
20
minutes
later
to
find
the
flavors
have
only
enhanced
well
done
overall
i
was
surprised
by
this
quadrupels
arent
necessarily
my
favorite
style
but
i
really
enjoyed
this
beer
thank
you
victory
o
i
was
slightly
disapointed
by
this
i
was
expecting
a
little
bit
more
from
this
im
not
easily
intimidated
by
high
abv
beers
in
the
least
bit
but
i
think
it
takes
away
from
what
could
be
a
great
beer
its
obvious
there
are
a
lot
of
different
things
going
on
in
it
and
that
its
complex
but
it
gets
dominated
by
the
abv
in
the
end
comes
out
of
the
tap
an
attractive
coppery
amber
with
minimal
head
but
the
latter
may
be
an
artifact
of
the
pour
aroma
is
yeasty
and
fruity
not
particularly
strong
but
quite
inviting
mouthfilling
fruity
flavor

malty
apple

notes
with

deelishus
strongbodied
texture
is

fizzy
and
leaves
a
fruity
slightly
sweet
finish
victory
indeed
strong
and
boozy
but
lacking
the
expected
qualities
of
a
outstanding
quad
this
seemed
more
like
a
farmhouse
ale
than
a
belgian
quad
to
me
although
it
is
strong
disappointing
o
the
boozyness
lets
this
beer
down
a
touch
and
this
tastes
like
no
belgian
quad
i
have
ever
had
in
fact
its
more
than
a
tripel
than
a
quad
however
it
is
a
very
pleasurable
beer
in
its
own
right
o
very
belgian
aromas
and
flavours
a
solid
quad
with
all
the
features
of
the
style
i
e
heavy

the

out

ever
had

the

i
really
liked
the
taste
and

carbonation
for
the
style
looks
tastes
and
feels
a
lot
like
a
real
belgian
quad
im
impressed
o
nice
a
good
sipping
beer
this
would
go
nice
with
a
sweet
dessert
such
as
a
pineapple
upside
down
cake
or
a
cherry
pie
would
have
never
guessed
this
was
a
quad
from
the
look
of
the
beer
the
look
of
the
beer
is
a
nice
copperish
color
the
head
is
a
little
fizzy
and
settles
into
a
thin
scattered
film
over
top
of
he
beer
the
smell
is
sweet
and
very
pleasant
in
my
opinion
its
got
a
bit
of
a
dark
fruitiness
on
the
nose
the
taste
of
the
beer
is
sweet
and
has
an
interesting
dark
fruit
and
brown
sugar
taste
the
mouthfeel
had
a
good
carbonation
and
remains
pretty
smooth
overall
i
liked
this
beer
quite
a
bit
really
surprising
i
like
many
belgian
brews
and
this
quad
is
excellent
i
am
very
glad
i
finally
found
and
tried
it
great
balance
of
ingredients
i
will
put
it
as
one
brew
thats
on
the
top
of
my
list
o
instant
favorite
flavors
hit
the
nose
on
opening
and
lasts
until
bottle
is
emptied
definitely
not
a
sessioner
enjoy
it
sipping
every
few
minutes
letting
it
warm
to
room
temp
love
it
absolutely
love
it
cant
say
enough
about
the
blast
of
deep
fruity
and
frankly
red
wine
flavors
going
on
here
this
beer
holds
its
own
against
any
european
quad
i
have
ever
drank
overall
not
crazy
enough
to
be
really
interesting
to
me
and
not
enjoyable
enough
to
my
tastes
to
purchase
again
probably
well
worth
cellaring
hop
character
would
subdue
and
fruitspice
would
develop
but
i
probably
wont
be
going
back
for
more
fans
of
american
strong
alesbarleywines
looking
to
dabble
in
something
more
belgianinspired
worth
a
try
otherwise
maybe
not
overall
hard
to
rate
to
style
as
this
beer
is
180
degrees
from
a
st
bernardus
abt
12
or
a
rochefort
10
that
being
said
it
is
still
a
good
enjoyable
beer
its
just
not
a
belgian
quadsda
o
im
really
enjoying
this
one
the
12
never
even
shows
its
pretty
little
head
like
one
would
think
this
isnt
your
grand
daddys
quad
it
feels
and
tastes
like
something
old
but
with
a
new
twist
kinda
like
the
new
dodge
challenger
looks
familar
enough
but
with
a
great
newness
to
it

overall
his

as

definitely
one

definitely
something
to

in

and
slowly
the

you
can

taste
the

it

get

be

a

beer
cant

to

again
notes
glad
to
have
finally
bought
and
tried
this
beer
from
victory
an
early
favorite
brewery
in
my
explorations
thanks
to
victory
golden
monkey
i
think
that
this
beer
provides
a
good
value
too
at
only
7
99
for
the
corked
and
caged
bottle
o
a
very
solid
but
not
world
class
quad
id
love
to
age
one
of
these
3
or
4
years
as
i
imagine
it
would
really
mature
the
beer
for
the
better
still
this
is
a
very
solid
effort
maybe
in
the
top
3
or
4
american
quads
ive
had
definitely
worth
picking
up
and
enjoying
cheers
a
bit
harsh
at
first
but
it
comes
together
as
it
warms
smooth
and
succulent
12
abv
demands
that
this
will
be
a
sipper
o
easily
a
storeable
beer
i
would
say
a
late
4yr
would
be
prime
just
a
great
addittion
to
all
the
great
beers
these
guys
come
up
with
d
a

most
def
however
it
drinks
and
goes
down
like

fest
seasonal
let
the
bottle
set
out
a
little
bit
from
the
fridge
upon
opening
with
a
nice
little
pop
i
must
say
that
this
is
quite
a
tasty
beer
lots

but
aside
from

the

these
are

and
im
noting
a
bitterness
described
in
an
previous
review
that
imo
doesnt
mesh
well
with
the
overall
profile
minus
points
for
that
mouthfeel
is
decent
sflpunk
drinkability
definetly
couldnt
have
more
than
one
of
these
it
is
drinkable
if
youre
just
sipping
12
alcohol
lets
you
know
its
there
by
the
end
of
the
bottle
if
the
abv
werent
so
high
i
could
probably
drink
more
notes
nothing
wrong
but
it
doesnt
stand
out
to
me
it
tastes
like
a
boozy
saison
it
isnt
nearly
dark
or
malty
enough
to
be
a
great
quad
to
me
but
its
not
bad
dfor
12
abv
it
definitely
catches
up
with
you
yet
its
dangerously
wellhidden
during
the
drink
its
a
really
nice
interpretation
of
the
style
with
more
of
a
bright
fruitiness
rather
than
the
dark
fruit
flavors
of
traditional
quaddark
ales
d
this
beer
has
a
higher
abv
but
is
still
pretty
drinkable
the
end
of
the
bottle
was
a
little
rough
but
overall
a
good
keeper
i
wish
this
beer
would
be
a
little
less
sweet
but
we
cant
have
it
all
now
can
we
haha
notes
i
keep
on
being
surprised
by
some
of
this
big
bottles
form
victory
i
like
the
brewery
but
the
large
offerings
are
on
another
level
this
reminds
me
of
some
sensations
as
i
was
approaching
quads
a
while
back
and
in
particular
us
ones
i
like
it
but
under
the
unfermented
sugar
and
the
belgium
yeast
i
feel
there
is
a
closeted
barleywine
a
nice
one
mind
you
and
im
going
to
try
to
get
hold
of
this
brew
again
i
think
that
it
is
a
rather
rich
and
stimulating
take
on
a
quad
but
the
barleywine
is
there
for
me
too
albeit
rather
well
dressed
up
bottled
on
sept
18
2009
sampled
on
june

2010
it
is
served
at
about
4748
degrees
but
warmed
up
even
more
as
i
savored
the
offering
it
pours
a
cloudy
ambercopper
with
a
very
thick
but
puffy
beige
head
the
multifaceted
aroma
includes
malts
wheat
grains
and
yeast
there
is
a
strong
bitterness
in
the
flavor
and
some
wheat
which
culminates
in
a
sinusclearing
hoppy
finale
quite
a
decent
brew
drinkability
very
enjoyable
beer
not
exactly
a
st
bernadus
but
for
a
local
brew
very
good
i
will
be
drinking
this
again
pours
from
the
750
ml
bottle
a
nice
copper
color
with
a
good
inch
or
so
of
creamy
white
head
aromas
of
caramel
belgian
spices
raisins
and
granny
smith
apples
very
boozy
with
flavors
of
apple
cider
caramel
belgian
yeast
and
spices
this
is
a
big
alcoholic
beer
tough
to
get
through
in
a
single
setting
victory
twelve
poured
a
dark
amber
color
with
a
medium
sized
head
it
had
a
great
smell
of
hops
and
other
flavors
it
had
a
sharp
taste
the
alchool
was
a
bit
strong
in
it
but
there
was
a
combintion
of
complex
flavors
and
hops
it
was
by
no
means
a
light
beer
but
not
too
difficult
to
drink
the
only
promblem
might
have
been
the
strong
alchool
flavor
overall
fantastic
beer
a
must
try
i
would
love
to
get
another
bottle
and
let
it
age
summary
this
a
very
nice
beer
be
sure
to
share
with
friends
it
gets
a
bit
heavy
for
me
after
a
serving
and
can
get
overwhelming
if
one
drinks
it
too
quickly
again
this
is
definitely
a
sipping
beer
i
will
be
trying
some
other
victory
beers
after
trying
this
one
im
a
little
intrigued
by
victory
brewing
but
still
uncertain
this
beer
doesnt
do
anything
to
improve
or
disprove
my
opinion
one
of
the
best
beers
i
have
had
really
something
special
drinkability
considering
the
12
abv
this
is
a
decently
drinkable
beer
d
this
is
a
very
well
made
beer
with
a
great
flavor
profile
that
being
said
i
have
a
750
bottle
and
no
one
else
will
drink
any
so
one
will
probably
be
enough
a
corked
750ml
bottled
on
august
27th
2004
popped
and
poured
into
my
trusty
tulip
glass
v12
appears
a
hazed
golden
auburn
color
with
about
a
finger
of
off
white
foam
nose
and
flavors
consist
of
sweet
candied
apples
caramel
pears
grapes
slightly
spicy
yeast
ripe
plums
some
lingering
alcohol
heat
but
it
is
rather
muted
overall
after
almost
6
years
in
the
bottle
the
taste
takes
a
back
seat
to
the
complex
nose
but
it
is
also
not
to
be
passed
by
either
the
ale
approaches
full
bodied
with
delicate
yet
somewhat
lively
carbonation
akin
to
a
good
bottle
conditioned
beer
really
nice
this
was
worth
the
wait
pours
a
hazy
ambercopperish
color
with
a
good
bit
of
thick
fluffy
head
and
lacing
has
a
bit
of
a
malty
flavor
nothing
else
really
sttod
out
to
me
except
the
amount
of
alcohol
which
i
thought
was
very
present
in
the
smell
but
not
in
the
taste
at
all
i
saw
some
other
reviewers
dont
feel
the
same
way
but
i
thought
the
alcohol
was
very
well
hidden
and
the
beer
was
very
good
and
very
easy
to
drink
an
excellent
beer
i
hold
this
up
some
of
the
very
best
quads
also
veyr
drinkable
for
12
abv
da
little
too
much
alcohol
to
make
it
very
drinkable
but
still
one
to
try
drinkability
this
is
not
a
quad
and
not
a
very
good
belgian
style
beer
the
worst
of
the
victory
lineup
that
i
drank
at
the
victory
party
there
are
two
ways
to
review
this
beer
one
against
what
it
should
be
to
the
style
and
the
other
just
as
a
general
beer
both
in
my
opinion
fall
short
of
what
it
should
for
the
style
and
as
a
beer
but
then
again
im
biased
to
overly
hopped
beers
especially
when
the
style
just
isnt
meant
for
this
level
of
ibu
in
my
opinion
there
is
too
much
refined
sugar
used
to
get
up
the
ibu
which
should
be
reduced
slightly
and
presented
more
in
other
adjunct
or
malt
for
complexity
it
is
a
very
straight
forward
malt
profile
built
on
light
malts
i
dont
mind
the
hotness
that
comes
through
on
the
tongue
which
may
be
offputting
to
others
this
is
really
a
malty
imperial
tripel
if
there
was
such
a
thing
and
falls
short
of
many
in
the
style
however
id
rather
have
this
over
any
ipa
if
you
like
an
over
hopped
american
belgian
that
packs
a
lot
of
punch
this
is
the
beer
for
you
it
doesnt
have
the
complexity
or
balance
to
rival
the
most
complex
category
of
beer
on
the
planet
d
another
well
crafted
belgian
knockoff
from
victory
12
is
noticeable
but
doesnt
impede
enjoyment
served
from
a
bomber
into
a
pint
glass
pours
a
nice
amber
shade
with
a
2
finger
cream
colored
head
smell
is
very
citric
and
hoppy
tastes
like
it
smells
citric
and
hoppy
the
alcohol
comes
through
a
decent
bit
feels
very
good
and
somewhat
light
actually
because
of
the
high
alcohol
one
bomber
of
this
should
be
enough
for
the
night
drinkability
nice

beer
to
lay

poured

a
nice
orangeamber

for
some
reason
i
expected
this
to
be
darker
moderate
head
that
fizzes
out
quickly
leaving
a
ring
and
some
suds
some
nice
lacing
left
behind
after
each
sip
smells
sweet
at
first
figs
grapes
apricot
a
little
musty
slightly
hoppy
a
noticeable
amount
of
alcohol
in
the
nose
the
taste
is
much
the
same
fruity
and
sweet
malt
its
a
well
balanced
taste
and
it
tastes
every
bit
of
12
abv
no
bitterness
to
speak
of
medium
to
heavy
mouthfeel
leaves
no
stick
and
is
rather
dry
its
a
sipper
for
sure
overall
this
is
very
enjoyable
drinkability
great
balance
extremely
pleasant
aftertaste
i
recommend
giving
this
a
try
overall
a
pretty
good
version
of
a
quad
maybe
a
touch
sweet
for
the
lighter
mouthfeel
though
the
alcohol
is
apparent
in
the
taste
lacks
lacing
and
the
beer
is
a
bit
hazy
i
like
the
yeast
choice
though
it
gave
a
hint
of
citrusy
fruitiness
to
it
could
use
a
few
more
years
in
the
cellar
d
i
really
enjoyed
this
one
a
very
nice
sipping
beer
for
a
cool
evening
this
is
a
very
stellar
take
on
the
style
from
what
i
remember
this
is
one
of
the
easier
drinking
quads
i
have
had
before
victory
continues
to
shine
each
time
i
drink
their
brews
very
good
well
done
victory
medium
bodied
with
a
stronger
malt
body
than
i
expected
with
lots
of
sweetness
from
the
dark
fruit
and
strong
alcohol
presence
hints
of
plum
dark
cherry
grape
fig
and
raisin
as
well
as
some
candy
sugar
but
these
flavors
are
overpowered
by
the
strong
alcohol
flavor
abv
not
well
masked
at
all
hurting
this

there
is

is
too
sweet
and
has
too
much
of
alcohol
presence
dry
finish
i
cant
say
that
the
taste
lived
up
to
my
expectations
rather
monodimensional
good
front
palate
decent
mouthfeel
but
this
beer
finishes
with
a
harsh
alcoholic
note
that
was
almost
metallic
not
particularly
pleasant
i
finished
the
bottle
myself
and
left
the
sediment
in
the
bottle
this
was
a
good
brew
and
a
interesting
take
on
a
belgian
staple
i
would
buy
it
again
if
i
find
an
older
bottle
thanks
again
dan
out
of
the
caged
bomber
bottle
this
brew
was
a
hazy
orangecopper
color
with
one
finger
of
khakicolored
head
the
collar
retention
was
good
and
the
lacing
good
too
the
aroma
was
delicious
citrus
caramel
toffee
alcohol
sweet
dough
and
spices
an
excellent
blend
of
hops
malt
and
yeast
elements
the
flavors
were
parallel
equally
big
and
enticing
albeit
sweet
starting
with
the
carameltoffee
sweetness
it
was
punctuated
by
the
punch
of
alcohol
in
the
middle
and
a
bitter
hoppy
finish
at
the
end
complex
but
not
overwhelming
well
balanced
and
quite
drinkable
for
the
massive
12
alcohol
the
mouthfeel
was
creamy
the
body
medium
and
the
carbonation
light
d
woah
this
one
is
a
warmer
for
sure
itll
make
your
core
warm
up
quickly
a
good
strong
sipper
that
could
be
a
great
aperitif
or
a
night
cap
but
dont
operate
machinery
or
anything
that
requires
hand
to
eye
coordination
after
drinking
this
one
because
you
wont
have
it
dit
has
a
lot
happening
but
it
seems
to
work
very
well
the
huge
alcohol
is
also
extremely
well
hidden
and
only
shows
up
slightly
towards
the
back
considering
the
high
abv
the
alcohol
is
very
well
hidden
there
is
a
slight
boozy
burn
but
all
things
considered
its
quite
subdued
it
took
me
a
bit
under
two
hours
to
drink
the
whole
750
ml
d
very
well
balanced
considering
the
style
and
abv
this
is
amazingly
drinkable
abv
is
so
hidden
ive
actually
drunk
the
whole
bottle
no
problem
man
overall
an
outstanding
brew
not
perhaps
worldclass
like
the
st
bernardus
or
rochefort
10
but
a
great
us
version
definately
find
try
d
considering
style
and
abv
this
is
actually
quite
drinkable
abv
is
very
well
hidden
overall
a
solid
but
not
outstanding
brew
give
this
one
a
try
even
at
12
there
was
no
fusels
detectable
in
this
fine
beer
spicy
cloves
plums
raisins
in
both
aroma
and
taste
the
flavour
blends
so
well
i
dare
to
say
that
this
is
a
perfectly
balanced
beer
the
only
thing
i
knocked
it
down
by
half
a
point
was
the
aroma
was
great
just
not
to
what
i
would
have
considered
a
perfect
aroma
i
am
definitely
going
to
pick
up
more
bottles
of
this
finely
crafted
brew
i
was
surprised
in
this
beer
goes
down
far
too
easily
for
a
beer
of
this
abv
still
while
not
hidden
if
you
pay
attention
you
can
taste
the
fact
that
this
stuff
is
not
to
be
taken
for
granted
it
us
quite
strong
not
a
bad
american
take
on
a
quad
i
think
some
age
would
really
eliminate
some
of
the
noticeable
booze
d
not
complex
and
boozy
which
made
this
not
enjoyable
needs
more
aging
not
too
hard
to
drink
fresh
but
the
alcohol
will
calm
down
over
time
bringing
out
more
flavors
i
poured
into
a
snifter
from
a
25
ounce
bottle
it
is
a
deep
orange
with
a
medium
short
lasting
white
head
the
aroma
is
sweet
bourbon
apples
and
ripe
fruit
the
alcohol
is
up
front
but
not
overpowering
in
the
flavor
it
is
rounded
by
fruity
flavors
apples
and
pears
it
finishes
with
a
hot
alcohol
it
is
a
medium
sipper
i
liked
this
and
would
buy
it
again
overall
a
sipper
as
intended
but
a
very
tasty
sensory
adventure
i
had
this
beer
with
a
delirium
noel
v12
is
absolutely
superior
hard
to
compare
with
anything
else
as
it
is
in
a
category
all
its
own
i
will
buy
all
the
v12
i
can
buy
complicated
beer
well
thought
out
do
not
wait
five
years
the
americans
make
good
beer
too
d
a
very
potent
and
powerful
offering
from
the
folks
at
victory
a
definite
sipper
an
excellent
appearance
and
aroma
coupled
with
a
very
good
taste
go
a
long
way
however
a
slightly
over
carbonated
and
fizzy
mouthfeel
hold
this
american
quad
back
from
being
a
top
tier
offering
i
would
still
recommend
and
welcome
the
chance
to
drink
again
in
the
future
this
one
just
falls
well
short
of
its
better
known
belgian
counterparts
these
25
4
oz
bottles
are
not
intended
for
one
person
they
pack
a
serious
punch
and
leaving
feeling
like
you
were
hit
over
the
head
with
a
hammer
d
this
is
one
of
those
beers
that
i
could
drink
to
relax
maybe
once
or
twice
a
week
not
an
everyday
beer
i
enjoy
it
in
the
colder
months
and
wish
i
could
find
it
more
accessible
besides
just
at
the
brewery
very
drinkable
and
one
to
enjoy
over
a
long
period
of
time
this
is
a
great
indian
summer
beer
to
kick
football
off
with
drinkability
another
top
notch
brew
from
victory
delicious
and
time
tested
simply
put
its
good
i
will
absolutely
be
picking
up
a
few
more
bottles
on
my
next
beer
run
taste
is
sweet
and
belgian
light
bitterness
and
smooth
finish
its
a
bit
sharp
and
sweet
but
still
has
a
nice
fruitiness
to
it
very
good
d
very
drinkable
and
tasty
d
this
maybe
the
best
american
made
quad
that
ive
ever
tried
at
the
least
its
the
best
beer
ive
had
by
the
fine
victory
folks
dare
i
say
its
world
class
i
sampled
this
bottle
fresh
i
can
only
imagine
what
some
aging
would
do
for
this
tasty
beast
overall
sort
of
one
dimensional
with
raisin
sweetness
dominating
the
alcohol
was
pretty
well
hidden
and
the
mouth
feel
was
appropriate
overall
a
good
quad
and
definitely
worth
picking
up
if
you
have
the
chance
d
a
nice
beer
even
if
it
doesnt
stand
up
to
some
of
the
belgian
epics
i
would
definitely
buy
it
again
and
see
how
it
ages
d
excellent
beer
but
took
me
a
good
2
hours
to
drink
it
the
warmer
it
got
the
more
sugar
and
fruit
taste
it
became
when
it
was
colder
it
was
more
of
the
typical
belgian
candied
sugar
and
bread
taste
12
is
a
little
big
for
me
so
one
is
more
than
enough
on
a
cold
night
this
will
warm
you
up
quick
something
i
wanted
to
try
while
back
in
the
us
but
a
bit
big
for
me
sip
this
and
enjoy
it
d
tasty
goes
down
dangerously
easily
slightly
filling
strong
kick
good
representation
of
style
if
youre
in
the
mood
for
this
kind
of
beer
this
is
a
nice
strong
belgian
that
is
worth
drinking
for
as
long
as
you
can
handle
it
drinkabilitywise
i
think
id
give
this
a
5
if
i
could
drink
it
all
night
long
a
bit
too
sweet
and
a
bit
too
much
abv
to
make
this
drinkable
all
night
long
ill
give
the
big
bottle
a
shot
though
cheers
mfd
the
feel
and
drinkablity
are
quite
good
the
feel
is
a
full
medium
with
good
carbonation
the
carbonation
is
full
but
not
particularly
zesty
or
potent
nevertheless
the
beer
goes
down
easily
and
one
really
doensnt
take
as
full
a
notice
as
one
could
of
that
12
abv
surprisingly
smooth
except
for
the
finish
or
if
the
beer
is
held
in
mouth
for
a
long
time
d
high
for
a
12
abv
quad
chalk
this
up
as
a
victory
for
victory
i
went
into
this
with
little
expectations
and
was
pretty
impressed
with
the
end
result
one
of
the
better
american
versions
of
a
quadrupel
i
have
had
though
not
so
dark
and
malty
it
is
balanced
and
loaded
with
plenty
of
fruity
and
phenolic
characters
the
best
examples
of
the
style
possess
also
remarkably
approachable
for
a
12
beer
recommended
this
is
a
great
beer
to
share
with
friends
as
it
is
pretty
hard
to
share
a
tiny
bottle
that
the
belgian
quads
usually
come
in
another
victory
for
victory
they
do
a
great
job
of
filling
the
gaps
that
most
american
craft
brewers
leave
cheers
goes
down
smooth
despite
being
so
damn
strong
and
a
remarkably
drinkable
beer
given
the
alcohol
content
man
this
is
strong
beer
and
very
good
at
that
i
give
the
guy
at
victory
a
standing
o
they
are
putting
out
quality
beers
at
a
great
price
and
they
are
not
shorting
the
consumer
on
taste
or
quality
this
v
twelvw
goes
along
way
be
careful
it
is
the
monkeys
bigger
brother
if
you
like
raisins
and
figs
and
a
great
buzz
you
found
it
cheers
drinkability
i
thoroughly
enjoyed
this
beer
but
at
this
abv
one
glass
a
night
is
fine
so
be
prepared
to
save
part
of
it
or
share
it
with
others
ill
be
happy
to
have
this
again
and
surely
would
pour
it
for
friends
and
relatives
as
a
special
treat
overall
it
is
a
very
hearty
heavy
intense
beer
would
benefit
from
more
subtle
complexities
a
bit
of
mellowing
and
refinement
an
excellent
candidate
for
cellaring
considering
that
this
bottle
is
only
9
months
old
d
cheers
to
victory
for
making
an
excellent
quadrupel
i
just
visited
their
brewery
and
they
are
confident
in
saying
they
are
the
best
craft
brewery
on
the
east
coast
ill
second
that
unless
someone
wants
to
steer
me
in
another
direction
and
convince
me
otherwise
the
vtwelve
has
been
added
to
one
of
my
top
favorites
m
again
well
done
not
too
gassy
and
none
of
the
ingredients
hijack
the
beer
all
in
all
very
well
done
and
i
would
certainly
reach
for
this
beer
again
good
sipper
an
aptly
named
brew
easy
drinkability
quite
a
surprise
this
beer
has
a
lot
to
offer
to
the
senses
entirely
to
easy
to
drink
it
can
get
away
from
you
enjoy
belgian
quads
are
not
a
style
i
usually
go
out
of
my
way
for
but
this
is
a
decent
one
victory
never
disappoints
and
if
you
are
a
fan
of
the
style
this
is
one
to
seek
out
not
great
but
a
solid
effort
overall
this
is
a
solid
quad
but
i
didnt
think
it
had
enough
going
on
to
be
anything
more
than
that
id
like
to
try
the
bottle
version
to
see
if
it
gains
anything
from
the
bottle
conditioning
mouthfeel
is
medium
bodied
chewy
sugary
and
full
of
flavor
drinkability
this
is
meant
to
be
for
sharing
and
i
kept
it
for
myself
alone
it
just
becomes
too
sweet
and
boozy
its
fantastic
but
share
it
d
very
sweet
to
drink
which
suits
me
just
fine
maybe
lacking
some
of
the
complexity
of
other
quads
but
all
in
all
a
pretty
damn
good
beer
the
beer
has
a
nice
complete
flavor
the
alcohol
comes
through
quite
a
bit
but
helps
a
keep
a
lingering
finish
there
is
some
malty
sweetness
up
front
but
it
quickly
followed
by
hoppy
bitterness
and
alcohol
all
of
these
flavors
resolve
themselves
as
the
beers
flavor
lingers
i
like
this
one
and
given
the
high
abv
it
is
quite
drinkable
bought
from
the
brewery
and
poured
in
a
goblet
seemed
a
little
on
the
reddish
side
an
excellent
feel
in
the
mouth
somewhat
reminiscent
of
a
slightly
bitter
chimay
quad
has
an
exceptional
aftertaste
that
lingers
forever
easy
to
drink
the
philadelphia
area
finally
has
something
to
be
proud
of
this
is
a
solid
belgian
style
beer
though
i
think
its
probably
more
successful
as
a
belgian
pale
ale
as
a
quad
its
a
little
too
sweet
and
lacks
the
carbonation
and
body
of
the
best
in
the
style
pours
a
mediumbodied
purpleamber
in
color
average
head
and
lacing
smells
like
typical
sugary
raisins
normally
associated
with
the
genre
decent
flavor
on
the
sweeter
side
lots
of
plums
figs
etc
medium
bodied
decently
slick
mouthfeel
it
lacks
that
bready
fillingness
velvery
smoothness
the
best
quads
have
very
boozey
though
and
this
is
aged
around
16
months
i
thought
it
would
have
mellowed
out
a
lot
more
by
now
i
wouldnt
even
think
of
trying
this
fresh
like
i
did
the
first
time
having
it
before
pours
with
a
deep
golden
and
slightly
reddish
body
and
decent
light
tan
quarter
to
half
inch
head
smells
are
of
candied
sugars
and
dark
fruits
fig
raisin
apricot
it
tastes
good
but
im
not
incredibly
impressed
it
is
a
bit
sweeter
than
i
would
like
and
the
flavors
are
not
incredibly
deep
and
complex
its
not
as
bready
and
smooth
as
i
was
hoping
it
would
be
i
will
try
this
again
but
i
would
let
it
cellar
for
a
few
years
and
to
allow
the
flavors
to
develop
d
very
drinkable
would
not
want
to
drink
alot
but
would
have
again
d
this
is
a
huge
beer
with
a
lot
of
alcohol
yet
it
is
fairly
easy
to
drink
nice
beer
all
the
way
around
but
definitely
not
the
best
representative
of
the
style
interesting
beer
and
im
glad
to
have
tried
it
but
i
dont
know
if
ill
be
getting
it
again
medium
body
good
carbonation
smooth
and
very
easy
to
drink
the
beer
did
have
an
oily
or
slick
aftertaste
to
it
overall
an
excellent
beer
and
maybe
one
of
the
best
quads
i
have
had
an
all
around
winner
thats
big
and
bold
and
probably
great
with
thai
food
and
other
bold
flavored
dishes
a
winner
750ml
caged
and
corked
bottle
from
mckinnons
in
salem
nh
pours
a
murky
copper
body
with
an
inch
and
a
half
to
two
inches
of
light
tan
head
smells
fruity
pears
raisins
citrus
with
some
spice
caramel
brown
sugar
tastes
fruity
sweet
with
caramel
and
brown
sugar
notes
fairly
dry
despite
the
robust
sweet
flavors
that
equally
comprise
the
flavor
balanced
and
subdued
as
any
good
quad
should
be
smooth
medium
body
with
ample
carbonation
a
sipper
for
sure
as
is
to
be
expected
but
one
sip
most
definitely
invites
another
a
really
solid
quad
and
an
enjoyable
beer
not
overwhelming
or
in
your
face
like
a
lot
of
american
interpretations
are
but
balanced
and
enjoyable
pretty
good
for
12
one
bottle
is
definitely
enough
this
is
a
new
favorite
for
me
and
my
wife
maybe
top
10
maybe
top
5
d
ehh
this
is
probably
my
least
favorite
quad
thus
far
the
alcohol
isnt
exactly
wellhidden
and
the
flavor
is
kinda
dirty
extremely
smooth
mouthfeel
and
very
easy
to
drink
this
is
honestly
one
of
the
easiest
to
drink
high
gravity
beer
ive
tasted
250
in
and
a
solid
beer
i
would
have
to
call
this
my
favorite
quad
over
blvd
and
ommegangs
offerings
d
this
is
a
pretty
good
quad
despite
the
high
abv
it
is
not
too
boozy
overall
this
is
a
fantastic
beer
that
destroys
my
prejudices
about
highalcohol
beers
for
me
8
tends
to
be
about
the
sweet
spot
but
this
beer
pulls
together
the
high
abv
with
some
great
flavors
without
being
too
sweet
or
too
boozy
great
pickup
a
nice
medium
body
with
ample
carbonation
for
a
quad
easy
to
drink
but
a
nice
bottle
to
share
with
someone
uncork
a
bottle
and
slowly
savor
the
night
i
could
drink
quite
a
bit
of
this
another
excellent
offering
from
the
folks
at
victory
d
not
an
overwhelming
quad
by
any
means
the
flavors
arent
as
developed
as
in
other
quads
but
still
quite
flavorful
the
lighter
alcohol
profile
makes
it
much
more
drinkable
than
others
however
and
you
can
still
feel
the
alcohol
in
other
ways
well
worth
the
price
add
some
aging
in
and
this
is
a
stellar
beer
this
is
one
to
enjoy
on
a
cold
day
as
it
warms
you
up
thankfully
i
split
this
bottle
and
about
a
12oz
serving

this
is
a
pretty
nice
quad
that
i
enjoyed
my
time
with
a
little
too
sweet
from
the
malts
fruits
and
candied
sugar
for
my
blood
but
that
is
what
makes
quads
great
they
deserve
to
be
savored
and

discussing
the

at

would
probably
last
longer
as
well
an
intersting
take
on
a
quad
if
that
is
what
this

to
be
probably
not

was
worth
it
for
the

rj
drinkability
a
whole
bomber
of
this
beer
is
a
tough
task
for
just
one
person
and
the
alcohol
overtook
some
of
the
great
qualities
this
beer
had
d
slightly
better
than
average
drinkability
i
would
like
to
give
it
a
go
on
tap
and
see
what
changes
smells
a
lot
like
apple
juice
to
me
flavor
is
more
of
funky
yeast
and
alcohol
not
especially
tasty
softens
as
it
warms

not
my
favorite
overpriced
too
poured
this
reddish
brown
coloration
belgianinspired
ale
into
a
pint
glass
when
first
poured
it
came
with
a
nice
amount
of
foam
that
reduced
to
wisps
of
lacing
the
aroma
is
that
of
fruits
and
sweet
hop
aromas
the
taste
follows
suit
but
then
turns
to
apricot
hops
slight
hints
of
colander
well
balanced
as
any
victory
brew
has
been
to
me
so
far
if
you
want
an
over
the
top
extreme
version
of
the
style
then
pour
this
one
otherwise
this
is
too
much
sweet
syrupy
estery
for
someone
to
enjoy
this
is
a
huge
beer
and
also
a
very
tasty
one
a
nice
quad
for
sure
and
worth
seeking
out
drinkability
moderate
this
is
a
strong
brew
at
12
i
would
drink
it
again
in
the
winter
tastes
similar
to
the
smell
lots
of
orange
peel
and
dried
fruit
not
horrible
but
i
expect
more
from
victory
and
from
a
quad
i
am
happy
with
simplicity
from
other
styles
but
believe
a
quad
has
to
have
a
certain
complexity
absent
in
the
twelve
for
a
12
abv
it
masks
the
alcohol
reasonably
well
i
got
through
the
bomber
but
kind
of
wished
it
was
a
12
ouncer
so
i
could
move
on
to
something
more
interesting
or
tastier
the
taste
does
not
replicate
the
complexities
of
the
nose
less
fruity
and
less
sweet
than
i
would
have
anticipated
there
is
some
additional
depth
present
through
a
somewhat
funky
hay
quality
that
seems
out
of
place
in
a
quad
and
better
suited
to
a
saison
the
initial
fruit
flavors
described
above
are
muted
and
brief
passing
listlessly
towards
the
aforementioned
dry
hay
finish
less
rich
and
lighter
bodied
too
the
carbonation
is
full
in
all
its
belgianesque
beauty
but
the
liquid
seems
slightly
thinner
than
i
would
have
hoped
the
alcohol
is
hidden
in
a
drying
finish
but
the
warming
effect
on
the
throat
cannot
be
dismissed
this
doesnt
play
out
as
a
traditional
quad
but
is
a
good
beer
nonetheless
yet
nowhere
near
the
best

is
ok
this
isnt
the
greatest
quad
really
without
any
esters
it
just
a
sugary
bspa
thats
not
even
that
good
for
one
of
those
a
bummer
id
been
sitting
on
it
for
so
long
a
gift
from
a
close

i
wish
it
was
better
the
abv
is
well
hidden
but
also
rather
bruising
the
label
claims
it
can
run
for
5
years
and
by
the
numbers
12
quad
id
make
the
same
guess
but
at
a
little
over
1
year
old
it
doesnt
seem
to
be
holding
up
well
that
said
it
could
be
in
a
lull
phase
and
turnaround
with
more
time
but
its
my
only
bottle
in
the
cellar
and
not
one
i
care
to
restock
d
a
good
drinking
quad
most
significantly
the
reduction
of
co2
really
helped
me
enjoy
this

otherwise
its
got
a
great
amount
of
flavor
and
the

is
hidden
well

not
over

this

wasnt

not
up
to
the
high
standards
they
usually
meet
victorys
got
an
impressive
quad
here
its
big
and
badass
but
somehow
comes
across
as
just
a
deep
and
flavorful
beer
it
doesnt
have
any
glaring
flaws
i
certainly
have
no
reservations
recommending
it
thanks
chris
d
heavy
on
peppers
and
rich
complexity
hits
the
tongue
very
nicely
and
prickles
all
around
while
it
drinks
pretty
easily
one
should
proceed
with
extreme
caution
glad
i
picked
it
up
and
would
recommend
at
least
one
good
go
around
drinkability
is
low
why
because
this
beer
is
so
strong
there
is
no
way
you
could
drink
more
than
one
and
even
you
need
to
be
sharing
it
one
750ml
bottle
will
definitely
keep
you
home
or
wherever
it
is
you
drink
it
im
not
a
black
pepper
fan
and
this
beer
is
all
about
black
pepper
not
my
favorite
but
a
well
brewed
beer
nonetheless
very
smooth
for
12
i
gotta
say
that
drinkability
is
high
this
brew
could
creep
right
up
on
you
d
its
still
a
tad
bit
boozy
and
at
12
just
one
goblet
has
got
me
buzzing
a
bit
flavor
is
lovely
and
i
can
only
imagine
how
good
this
beer
could
taste
with
another
year
on
it
still
its
really
filling
and
strongdefinitely
one
to
sip
slowly
whilst
avoiding
overindulgence
overall
this
is
a
great
american
quad
not
quite
up
there
with
southampton
abbot
12
as
far
as
american
quads
go
and
not
on
par
with
the
belgians
but
this
is
a
great
representation
of
the
style

drinkability
i
found
this
an
easy

example
of
the
style
perhaps
too
easy
not
something
id
actively
search
out
as
i
didnt
find
it
overly
complext
but
definitely
something
to
try
once
drinkability
is
about
right
for
a
belgian
splitting
the
bomber
with
someone
else
is
about
the
right
amount
of
this
beer
d
flavor
being
what
it
is
and
12
abv
dictate
a
nice
sipping
beer
to
sink
into
wont
drink
a
lot
but
love
every
minute
d
the
only
drawback
to
this
is
that
its
too
potent
to
attempt
a
second
it
crept
up
on
me
the
more
empty
the
bottle
became
ive
had
this
one
fresh
as
well
and
i
dont
remember
it
being
this
great
time
has
definitely
worked
in
this
beers
favor
im
glad
i
have
some
more
of
this
years
versions
left
in
the
basement
overall
it
is
a
phenomenal
beer
d
not
so
much
because
the
flavours
are
so
strong
a
hint
of
spice
mildley
sour
and
a
strong
alcohal
presance
then
an
almost
fruty
quality
comes
in
as
the
beer
warms
their
is
a
sweet
quality

this
one
might
be
nice
to
cellar
a

of

this

is

pretty
solid
american
attempt
at
a
belgian
quad
i
bought
a
bottle
for
immediate
consumption
and
a
second
bottle
to
hold
on
to
for
aging
this
one
should
age
very
nicely
and
improve
quite
a
bit
in
a
couple
years

seemed
to
be
the
proper
beer
for
cheering
the

sugars

alcohols
and
a
surprisingly
large
amount

balance
in

is

the
candied
fruits
alcohols
and
hops
flavors
of
sweet
confectionate
sugar
cherries
berries
apples
figs
dates
grapes
apples
and
pears
make
for

balanced
brew
a
burst
of
perfumy
floral
herbal
and
pine
hops
fight
hard
to
balance
the
sweetness
and
nearly
dominate
at
times
the
taste
of
alcohol
with
the
hops

too
much
to
appreciate
the
delicacy
of
the
beer
textures
are
more
sweetsyrupy
than
malty
heat
and
abrassion
from

too
much
to
be
the
drinkable

that
it
wants
to
be
finishes
sticky
sweet
dry
and
with
a
lingering
floral
note
age
will
surely
be
kind
to
this
beer
i
would
not
buy
this
beer
again
but
i
guess
the
12
will
have
me
buzzing
by
the
time
i
am
done
with
this
one
d
easy
to
drink
the
12
abv
is
not
a
stinger
and
is
hidden
very
well
split
a
750
bottle
with
friends
served
in
a
chimay
chalice
i
found
this
beer
to
be
surprisingly
drinkable
for
the
12
alcohol
in
fact
for
the
strength
i
also
found
the
taste
and
aroma
to
be
a
bit
muted
still
i
found
a
wonderfully
complex
flavor
full
of
mellow
fruit
like
plum
and
tangerine
with
euro
hops
spice
around
the
edges
worth
trying
what
can
i
say
its
good
many
thanks
to
foxman
for
the
chance
to
taste
this
one
so
lets
think
about
this
a
minute
what
the
heck
is
that
flavor
oddly
ive
decided
that
the
second
flavor
in
this
is
beets
before
that
its
rich
sweet
caramel
candy
hmm
you
know
i
wish
i
had
another
bottle
or
two
of
this
id
like
to
compare
it
with
some
other
awesome
quads
side
by
side
i
mean
im
curious
but
hey
this
is
really
good
and
even
though
its
a
limited
release
its
a
lot
easier
to
get
than
say
westy
you
know
good
stuff
wish
i
had
a
few
cases
of
it
pretty
good
as
far
as
american
made
quads
go
but
i
think
id
go
with
three
philosophers
first
the
strong
alcohol
finish
detracts
from
the
drinkability
drinkable
for
its
effects
more
than
the
taste
but
not
my
much
corked
bottle
was
an
automatic
plus
in
my
eyes
but
the
beer
itself
stood
on
its
own
besides
presentation
murky
dark
amber
with
little
to
no
head
or
lacing
faint
dark
fruits
malts
barley
aromas
lack
an
alcohol
punch
to
them
so
this
is
not
overpowering
at
all
but
the
taste
definitely
shows
the
beers
true
colors
very
very
sweet
and
malty
with
a
perceived
alcohol
taste
that
is
very
well
balanced
mouthfeel
is
a
silky
crisp
texture
a
slow
night
sipping
is
recommended
to
enjoy
this
one
overall
really
good
highly
recommended
ive
always
thought
this
was
quite
solid
fresh
it
is
nice
to
know
it
ages
well
too
d
if
youre
into
quads
then
give
this
a
shot
its
one
of
the
best
american
examples
of
a
belgian
quadrupel
fruity
flavors

do
really
enjoy
this
one
i
do
start
to
feel
the
12
about
halfway
through
though
grape
and
light
hops
that
impart
a
mild
bitterness
toward
the
end
it
becomes
a
touch
too
sweet
it
is
really
too

the

didnt

poured
with
a
semifrothy
white
head
that
utterly
disintigrated
into
wispiness
it
was
a
deep
goldenamber
color
with
great
clarity
the
nose
gave
off
notes
of
cherries
and
melon
the
drawback
for
me
was
the
mouthfeel
but
not
in
a
bad
way
this
beverage
got
better
as
i
drank
it
like
brandy
and
lemon
the
nosefeel
is
thin
is
soaked
in
layers
of
alcohol
and
medicine
but
resilient
smells
fruity
and
earthy
and
a
litlte
alchohol
coming
through
taste
is
wonderfula
big
creamy
malty
flavor
dominates
there
is
a
surprising
light
hops
presence
with
a
slight
syrupyness
to
it
it
is
very
warming
in
the
stomach
and
esophagus
i
find
this
to
be
very
easy
to
quaff
for
a
12

beer
my
mind
has
been
changed
about
this
brew
its
pretty
nice
if
you
ask
me
kmpitz2may

i
think
time
has
already
crafted
this
beer
wonderfully
its
smooth
surprising
considering
the
12
abv
i
cared
for
the
bottle
well
and
doubt
it
was
an
off
bottle
it
didnt
taste
wrong
and
a
semi
dry
finish
once
the
taste
buds
adjust
this
brew
smooths
out
a
lot
it
still
is
spicey
so
be
warned
this
should
be
shared

at

wish
i
could

a

bottles
to

the

i
just
wish
that
i

i
think
you

so
much
in

head
sometimes
that
there
are
preconcieved
notions
of
how
the
beer
should
be
here
are
my
notes
from
a
bottle
i
split
with
a
friend
at
the
sharp
edge
creekhouse
appears
a
copper
amber
with
a
full
white
head
in
my
goblet
flavor
is
a
rolling
malt
barrage
with
hints
of
hops
and
one
very
pleasant
yeast
profile
of
spiced
up
notes
some
fruit
tones
wrapped
in
candied
sugar
mouthfeel
is
full
with
buttery
tones
and
this
beer
is
warming
with
a
good
amount
of
carbonation
the
only
thing
that
keeps
this
beer
from
becoming
a
session
beer
other
than
the
price
tag
is
the

i
liked

enjoyed

i

probably
the
best
sam

beer
ive
had
a
top
notch
quad
well
done
with
this
one
sa
o

an
outstanding
representation
of
the
belgian
quad
style
samuel
adams
may
not
hit
the
nail
on
the
head
every
time
but
sometimes
they
brew
up
some
real
magic
and
this
is
no
exception
highly
recommended
to
fans
of
the
style
as
well
as
it
is
recommended
to
be
purchased
in
multiples
and
left
in
the
cellar
for
a
special
occasion
overall
one
of
the
more
interesting
options
from
sa
an
above
average
quad
dark
brown
with
a
whitish
head
smells
of
charred
oak
prunes
dates
and
a
touch
of
pine
resin
wow
taste
is
surprisingly
complex
lots
of
cedar
and
chocolate
starts
off
with
a
rich
prune
and
port
wine
a
tangy
bitterness
of
pine
and
grapefruit
rind
and
blood
orange
tingle
your
tongue
a
long
sweetness
of
dried
raisin
lingers
long
with
a
wheat
bread
and
yeast
note
in
the
back
of
the
tongue
having
been
to
belgium
i
have
to
say
this
brew
from
sam
adams
of
all
brewers
is
quite
delicious
though
for
nomenclature
this
is
more
comparable
to
a
dubble
in
flavor
but
with
the
body
of
a
quad
not
a
typical
quad
very
low
esters
and
high
on
the
dried
fruitfigraisin
flavors
barrel
age
comes
through
up
front
for
sam
adams
this
is
a
good
beer
but
not
what
i
was
thinking
it
was
going
to
be
based
on
the
bottle
and
description
well
made
to
be
sure
but
not
my
favorite
quad
raisins
caramel
toffee
aroma
and
flavors
do
drinkability
is
not
that
high
since
it
is
10
2
alcohol
and
it
is
relatively
expensive
overall
this
is
a
solidly
brewed
beer
it
may
rank
up
there
with
some
of
my
more
favored
beers
from
samuel
adams
great
american
quad
especially
for
about
89
dollars
i
bought
this
in
a
sam
adams
barrel
room
collection
3
pack
at
my
local
costco
this
was
far
and
away
the
best
of
the
3
its
a
milky
amber
color
very
little
head
while
being
super
crisp
and
carbonated
in
the
mouth
tastes
better
than
it
smells
and
it
smells
pretty
good
id
buy
this
as
a
stand
alone
but
wouldnt
buy
the
3
pack
again
pours
a
cloudy
brown
color
14
inch
head
of
an

color
good
retention
and
decent
lacing
smells
of
alcohol

of
roasted
malt
earthiness
and
slight
spice

the
style
of
a
quadrupel

feel

with
an
average
carbonation
level
tastes

mustiness
hint

hint
of

and
earthiness
overall
average
appearance
body
and

hurt
by
the
mustyearthy
quality
that
is
unpleasant
its
not
a
very
good
example
of
a
true
belgian
quad
label
states
a
bold
belgian
quad
with
rich
notes
of
currants
raisins
and
clove
its
no
wonder
the
taste
is
not
of
a
belgian
ale
but
the
taste
isnt
bad
and
the
abv
is
up
there
i
might
look
for
this
again
remarks
good
but
a
little
too
sweet
needs
more
hops
to
balance
o
i
suffered
from
unmet
expectations
on
this
one
i
e
it
wasnt
bad
just
not
as
good
as
i
was
hoping
it
would
be
overall
a
really
rather
nice
quad
overall
this
is
a
quite
nice
and
approachable
brew
overall
that
i
can
see
most
people
rather
enjoying
very
impressed
definitely
the
best
sam
adams
brew
ive
had
so
far
750
ml
caged
and
corked
bottle
served
in
a
dfh
signature
glass
the
beer
pours
a
mahogany
brown
color
with
almost
a
couple
inch
creamy
light
tan
head
that
stayed
around
for
a
very
long
time
theres
also
a
good
amount
of
lacing
the
brew
smells
like
dark
fruit
plums
figs
raisins
cloves
molasses
and
some
sweet
spiciness
it
tastes
like
dark
fruit
plum
figs
raisins
cloves
red
grapes
caramel
molasses
oak
and
some
brown
sugar
mouthfeelbody
is
medium
its
creamy
and
is
well
carbonated
the
carbonation
is
soft
which
helps
make
it
easy
to
drink
i
thought
this
was
a
good
overall
brew
its
worth
picking
up
if
youve
never
had
it
before
wow
that
pretty
much
sums
up
what
i
think
about
this
beer
as
usual
sa
has
exceeded
expectations
for
me
and
this
beer
is
outstanding
i
was
expecting
a
good
brew
not
an
epic
one
very
rarely
will
i
buy
multiple
10
bottles
of
beer
but
i
immediately
went
back
to
the
store
the
next
day
and
bought
the
last
7
they
had
a
beautiful
pour
of
berries
and
oak
hit
you
with
a
tasty
aroma
as
soon
as
you
uncork
this
masterpiece
it
pours
a
beautiful
dark
ebony
color
has
the
perfect
amount
of
carbonation
and
lace
without
overpowering
the
tongue
very
smooth
and
not
too
overly
sweet
for
being
over
10
abv
and
overall
this
is
easily
the
best
new
brew
i
have
tried
in
many
months
dont
let
the
price
tag
scare
you
away
this
is
a
world
class
and
very
beautiful
beer
i
would
love
to
shake
the
brewers
hand
who
came
up
with
this
gem
nice
belgian
base
with
fruity
and
boozy
notes
yummy
pours
easily
with
great
head
which
settles
in
5
min
or
so
dark
brown
amber
color
aroma
of
plum
raisin
sweet
roasted
malt
feels
med
to
med
heavy

great
carbonation

effervescence
heavy

flavor
and
slight

very

malty
beer
good
alcohol
warmth
going
down
at

2
abv
this
is
a
slow
sipping
sit
down
and
enjoy
beer
overall
a
good
example
of
a
belgium
quad
although
with
longer
aging
the
sweet
malty
flavors
should
mellow
out
a
bit
overall
very
enjoyable
reasonably
priced
quad
must
say
i
am
impressed
by
sam
adams
on
this
one
solid
offering
from
sas
barrel
room
project
not
the
best
quad
youll
come
across
but
highlights
the
traditional
richness
of
the
style
like
most
of
the
beers
from
the
barrel
room
collection
this
is
a
home
run
i
wish
all
sam
adams
beers
were
this
good
i
typicall
find
their
selections
overrated
but
not
the
barrel
room
beers
this
very
well
resembles
the
more
expensive
and
exotic
belgians
where
the

fruity
sweetleaning
enjoyable
strong
belgianstyle
brew
wellworth
the
purchase
this
was
a
good
quad
i
think
i
underrated
it
a
bit
but
it
was
tasty
o
one
of
the
better
beers
ive
had
from
bbc
dark
brown
in
color
and
nearly
impenetrable
to
light
a
quarter
inch
of
beige
head
slowly
diminishes
to
the
point
that
it
is
only
a
trace
and
partially
covers
the
top
of
the
beer
in
the
aroma
notes
of
raisinsplums
and
a
hint
of
clove
are
present
the
flavor
is
much
more
intense
than
the
aroma
strong
notes
of
merlotraisinand
alcohol
are
prominent
the
alcoholic
aftertaste
is
initially
strongbut
it
mellows
out
as
it
warms
the
mouth
is
fairly
carbonated
and
sticky
i
think
this
could
have
used
cellaring
overall
its
a
great
beer
from
the
amazing
smell
and
an
overall
great
taste
its
a
good
beer
to
start
the
night
or
finish
an
amazing
night
with
overall
i
thought
this
was
a
pretty
good
beer
and
i
thought
it
was
a
good
example
of
a
american
made
quad
and
it
had
pretty
much
everything
that
i
look
for
in
the
style
with
some
nice
balance
that
kept
some
of
the
aspects
from
being
too
overpowering
this
beer
had
good
drinkability
it
was
pretty
smooth
fairly
clean
rich
not
too
crisp
a
little
chewy
a
little
sticky
a
little
filling
and
the
taste
did
a
good
job
of
holding
my
attention
i
think
half
the
bottle
is
a
good
amount
for
me
but
im
pretty
sure
i
could
drink
a
whole
bottle
without
getting
tired
of
it
what
i
like
the
most
about
this
beer
was
the
balance
i
find
that
to
be
the
biggest
problem
with
these
american
made
quads
but
this
one
had
the
balance
right
where
it
needed
to
be
what
i
liked
the
least
about
this
beer
was
nothing
there
wasnt
a
single
thing
that
i
disliked
or
would
change
about
this
beer
its
good
just
the
way
it
is
i
would
buy
this
beer
again
i
wouldnt
mind
seeing
how
it
does
with
a
some
age
and
i
would
recommend
it
to
just
about
anyone
who
likes
quads
all
in
all
i
was
pretty
happy
with
this
beer
im
a
little
leery
on
some
of
these
american
made
quads
but
this
one
proved
to
be
pretty
good
with
no
fancy
bells
and
whistles
it
was
just
a
straight
up
good
quad
when
i
saw
them
blend
this
beer
on
tv
they
used
some
of
their
funky
beer
cosmick
mother
funk
and
i
really
didnt
pick
up
any
of
that
in
this
beer
this
is
one
of
the
better
samuel
adams
beers
ive
had
and
its
one
of
the
better
american
made
quads
that
i
have
had
good
job
guys
this
one
was
a
pretty
tasty
quad
keep
up
the
good
work
ill
have
to
try
more
beers
from
their
barrel
room
collection
a
decent
bsda
not
off
flavors
but
it
does
lack
some
needed
depth
final
word
very
rich
complex
and
satisfying
the
earthy
spices
sweet
dark
fruit
and
buttery
bready
malts
all
sit
in
great
balance
with
each
other
and
present
an
experience
similar
to
eating
a
refined
spice
cake
dessert
my
only
complaint
with
this
brew
is
that
the
alcohol
comes
through
a
bit
too
much
and
makes
the
finish
a
little
boozy
this
isnt
completely
unexpected
as
it
is
a
quad
with
10
2
abv
but
masking
that
flavor
would
have
made
for
a
near
perfect
brew
only
avoid
this
one
if
you
just
absolutely
cant
stand
a
strong
boozy
character
everyone
else
should
snatch
it
up
especially
if
you
love
banana
bread
or
holiday
fruit
cake
taste
palate
there
are
nice
sweet
malt
notes
throughout
it
has
notes
of
dates
raisins
black
currants
and
sweet
breadyfruitcake
like
goodness
its
hops
add
a
touch
of
spice
and
herbal
bitterness
on
the
back
end
the
solid
10
2
abv
adds
a
mild
boozy
warming
feel
this
all
comes
on
nice
medium
to
full
feeling
body
with
smooth
carbonation
o
for
a
long
time
a
particular
belgian
quad
was
hailed
as
one
of
the
worlds
greatest
beers
it
could
have
been
partly
due
to
its
limited
availability
but
id
contest
that
this
style
is
one
of
the
hardest
to
replicate
for
american
brewers
because
of
its
deep
complexity
and
inherent
yeast
characteristics
having
said
that
samuel
adams
nails
the
quad
style
with
tetravis
so
well
it
could
have
come
straight
from
belgium
rich
maltiness
provides
a
sturdy
base
while
dark
fruit
and
spice
notes
comingle
with
absolutely
certainty
a
completely
brilliant
beer
overall
i
am
quite
intrigued
by
this
beer
it
really
stands
out
to
me
as
having
some
very
unique
flavors
that
i
have
yet
to
have
combined
into
one
beer
its
kind
of
like
an
american
barley
wine
got
with
a
belgian
yeast
and
got
throw
into
a
well
used
fruit
dehydrator
i
get
very
bored
with
the
beers
on
the
shelf
and
this
one
stands
out
to
me
as
different
a
musty
whiff
along
with
the
sweet
vermouth
and
roasted
malt
this
seems
more
like
an
authentic
belgian
brew
though
it
has
a
lot
of
those
cranky
peculiarities
that
make
it
less
than
drinkable
from
the
750
ml
bottle
purchased
at
bine
vine
in
san
diego
o
exactly
as
described
raisins
mild
spice
its
good
but
kind
of
a
letdown
the
latest
samuel
adams
barrel
room
beer
comes
out
of
the
gate
with
all
the
hallmark
flavors
that
are
expected
of
the
stronger
darker
belgian
style
but
as
the
palate
searches
for
those
distinctive
intelligibles
that
turn
good
beer
into
great
beer
tetravis
works
only
so
hard
to
help
the
palate
get
there
the
beer
pours
a
surprisingly
controlled
light
purplish
tan
head
that
takes
a
while
to
dissipate
but
does
not
leave
much
lacing
the
beer
itself
is
a
dark
purple
but
is
clearly
filtered
the
beer
color
also
has
some
light
ruby
notes
the
beer
smell
is
pretty
standard
and
nothing
special
dark
fruits
and
brown
sugar
the
smell
also
has
strong
yeast
notes
the
taste
is
the
same
but
a
bit
more
distinct
with
dark
fruits
such
as
plums
and
sugar
with
a
slight
sweet
boozy
taste
the
bready
yeast
is
also
noticeable
and
works
better
in
the
taste
than
the
smell
the
beer
is
heavybodied
and
thick
and
very
little
carbonation
overall
a
decent
quad
but
there
are
better
ones
out
there
overall
ok
beer
well
crafted
but
not
my
first
choice
for
a
beer
personally
an
okay
example
of
a
quad
but
not
one
i
would
revisit
o
not
bad
the
first
sip
is
strange
but
it
balances
out
nicely
after
with
just
a
bit
more
in
the
way
of
defined
flavor
it
could
genuinely
be
a
great
quad
in
certain
aspects
though
i
liked
it
better
than
the
oakaged
quad
i
had
after
this
boulevard
bbq
mouthfeel
is
full
bodied
sugary
viscous
with
plenty
of
heat
stabbing
the
palate
o
this
beer
is
kind
of
a
trickster
its
very
smooth
and
mild
on
the
palate
and
then
it
has
a
huge
smack
of
flavor
on
the
swallow
overall
not
a
bad
beer
but
i
think
there
are
better
representatives
of
the
style
o
excellent
tetravis
is
a
fine
example
of
why
i
love
quads
recommended
overall
a
good
straightforward
nononsense
quad
overall
this
is
a
winner
i
highly
reccommend
one
warning
be
careful
i
shared
this
with
a
friend
and
we
were
kicked
in
the
backside
before
the
night
started
overall
very
good
beer
but
can
think
of
a
few
others
i
would
rather
have
around
this
price
range
that
are
also
a
quad
it
does
give
you
a
little
bit
of
everything
just
lacks
that
potency
you
are
hoping
for
after
first
gulp
o
quite
good
overall
and
excellent
price
point
i
would
purchase
again
this
beer
pours
a
really
great
auburn
color
nice
lace
on
the
glass
the
smell
is
rich
with
dark
fruit
there
is
also
a
tinge
of
tartness
i
get
different
flavors
with
each
sip
fruits
a
little
smokiness
a
little
tart
there
is
also
a
slight
dry
alcohol
burn
but
in
a
good
way
there
is
a
bold
warmness
about
this
beer
that
i
like
over
all
a
complex
and
interesting
brew
checked
my
review
when
having
the
beer
again
and
it
is
dead
on
excellent
beer
that
i
am
glad
that
i
picked
up
quite
a
few
of
to
stick
in

on
for

a
very
enjoyable
offering
overall
this
beer
exceeded
my
expectations
coming
from
sam
adams
it
definitely
lacks
the
depth
and
refinement
of
some
trappist
beers
but
honestly
for
the
price
it
is
really
hard
to
beat
this
pours
a
cream
threefinger
head
that
fades
slowly
leaving
a
good

almost

pours
a

aroma
of

fruit
and
belian
yeast
in
the
taste
bready
doughy
malts
brown
sugar
raisin
a
light
bitterness
rounds
out
the
brew
given
the
strength
the
alcohol
is
not
noticeable
has
a
powdery
estery
yeast
character
medium
bodied
well
carbonated
overall
a
decent
strong
ale
but
lacking
punch
and
depth
the
oak
dries
it
out
just
enough
drinkability
is
ok
rich
flavor
with
well
hidden
abv
but
so
rich
and
not
particularly
elegant
od
no
real
alcohol
evident
started
out
a
bit
tame
but
became
quite
enjoyable
and
drinkable
tasty
stuff
tetravis
has
many
unconventional
elements
for
a
quad
being
barrelaged
blended
with
a
sour
ale
fermented
with
champagne
yeast
but
it
actually
compares
quite
favorably
with
the
styles
best
and
most
timehonoured
examples
i
mean
between
this
and
say
rochefort
or
st
bernardus
theres
no
contest
but
credit
where
credit
is
due
this
fares
better
than
most
american
brands
the
fruit
almost
stands
out
too
much
but
as
i
keep
sipping
im
liking
it
more
and
more
poured
from
750
ml
bottle
into
a
liefmans
goudenband
glass
my
preferred
all
purpose
beer
tasting
glass
tasted
on
12514
pours
a
clear
dark
honey
orange
with
a
foamy
beige
head
that
settles
to
a
partial
film
on
top
of
the
beer
small
dots
of
lace
form
around
the
glass
on
the
drink
down
smell
is
of
malt
caramel
banana
spice
and
alcohol
aromas
taste
is
much
the
same
with
caramel
toast
and
alcohol
flavors
on
the
finish
there
is
a
mild
amount
of
spice
bitterness
and
an
alcohol
kick
on
the
palate
with
each
sip
this
beer
has
a
lower
level
of
carbonation
with
a
slightly
crisp
and
dry
mouthfeel
overall
this
is
a
pretty
good
beer
with
a
really
nice
smell
but
the
flavors
are
a
bit
too
boozy
in
my
opinion
pours
a
lightly
hazy
orange
amber
color
with
a
huge
bubbly
off
white
head
that
persists
forever
the
aroma
is
huge
on
the
tart
current
with
hints
of
clove
and
raisin
moderate
amount
of
dark
sugary
malt
as
well
as
a
far
to
present
hit
of
papery
oxidation
the
flavor
is
heavy
on
the
clove
and
pepper
with
a
moderate
amount
of
sugary
sweetness
tart
currant
as
well
as
bits
of
lemon
and
orange
and
like
the
aroma
a
bit
too
much
oxidation
medium
to
thick
body
with
a
moderate
to
high
level
of
carbonation
and
a
sweet
bubbly
mouthfeel
meh
another
letdown
from
the
sam
adams
barrel
room
oxidized
and
a
bit
spicy
for
my
liking
d
this
was
a
surprisingly
good
beer
the
scent
and
taste
were
fairly
complex
and
enjoyable
the
body
was
great
and
the
finish
was
really
smooth
so
it
was
easy
to
drink
would
probably
age
well
but
doesnt
need
it
solid
brew
although
i
wish
it
had
a
little
more
barrel
character
excellent
aroma
the
wood
doesnt
stand
out
but
is
layered
underneath
the
fruit
and
malt
theres
noticeable
bitterness
that
almost
clashes
with
the
alcohol
it
would
get
in
the
way
if
it
were
any
stronger
but
really
helps
with
the
sweetness
pretty
good
for
an
american
made
quad
o
not
quite
as
good
as
their
new
world
tripel
but
another
belgian
well
executed
by
sam
adams
complex
taste
extremely
drinkable
ive
had
better
belgians
but
ive
also
had
worse
belgians
that
cost
a
lot
more
so
in
other
words
excellent
brew
and
worth
the
c
tetravis
is
an
impressive
quad
that
generally
hits
the
mark
for
the
defining
features
of
the
style
while
sam
adams
has
never
really
nailed
any
of
the
big
styles
they
already
produce
good
beers
at
good
price
points
o
not
a
huge
fan
of
these
styles
but
for
bbc
its
decent
nice
complex
flavor
o
meh
this
is
a
winner
for
sam
adams
plain
and
simple
it
isnt
my
style
or
what
id
want
but
if
you
want
to
blow
a
wine
snob
away
this
is
another
option
large
three
finger
frothy
head
with
good
lacing
on
a
very
nice
clear
amber
with
maroon
hues
body
the
beer
actually
looks
very
impressive
aroma
of
plum
sour
cherries
banana
bread
caramel
spices
cinnamon
belgian
yeast
flavor
is
a
little
disappointing
after
the
aroma
but
still
nice
although
the
fruitness
covers
up
some
of
the
belgian
character
flavor
notes
include
plum
raisin
currant
caramel
red
wine
this
one
is
fairly
sweet
too
thin
for
the
style
moderate
carbonation
i
felt
the
look
and
aroma
couldnt
be
lived
up
to
by
the
flavor
one
of
the
better
ones
of
this
series
for
sure
though
overall
pretty
solid
quad
and
reasonably
priced
too
enjoyable
and
would
get
it
again
overall
nice
and
fruity
quad
complex
i
would
get
this
one
again
it
may
be
my
favorite
in
the
barrel
room
collection
atmosphere
is
pretty
good
nice
head
and
some
persistent
lacing
nose
is
a
great
combination
of
malt
fruit
bitter
sweet
and
wood
components
peaty
and
fruity
with
a
little
savory
spice
overall
this
is
a
really
good
quaff
a
nice
quad
not
much
barrel
age
aspects
here
but
not
completely
mia
i
would
possibly
buy
this
again
seems
like
it
would
age
great
like
the
complexity
on
display
already
drinks
easy
for
the
heft
style
the
taste
is
sweet
malt
forward
with
a
quick
eruption
of
pepper
and
hops
finishing
it
off
the
alcohol
could
have
been
a
little
more
subdued
but
it
reminds
me
to
take
it
easy
i
found
it
to
be
a
nice
offering
from
samuel
adams
overall
not
a
home
run
but
a
nice
tasty
take
on
the
style
o
this
is
a
definitely
an
impressive
take
on
the
quad
style
by
jim
koch
and
company
one
of
the
better
american
versions
for
sure
bbcsa
take
a
lot
of
slack
from
many
people
on
here
and
it
leads
to
a
lot
of
their
brews
being
underrated
at
least
imo
this
one
here
is
a
winner
and
in
a
style
that
in
generally
fairly
difficult
to
pull
off
great
job
and
great
brew
overall
a
solid
version
of
a
quad
a
nice
one
to
sip
on
a
cold
and
thoughtful
winters
night
as
we
wait
for
spring
poured
a
thick
looking
light
caramel
color
with
almost
no
head
or
lacing
not
much
to
offer
in
aroma
the
dark
fruit
and
some
caramel
are
in
their
but
not
strong
the
flavor
is
pretty
good
good
bit
of
sweet
malt
some
fig
and
caramel
a
little
syrupy
especially
at
the
end
but
the
lip
smacking
malt
is
great
not
a
bad
job
of
hiding
the
11
8
alcohol
decent
but
not
spectacular
quad
this
is
a
very
good
belgium
ale
i
will
buy
this
again
super
smooth
for
such
a
high
alcohol
content
a
must
for
belgian
beer
drinkers
i
wouldnt
buy
a
6
pack
of
this
i
purchased
this
bottle
because
of
the
high
alcohol
content
typically
not
many
beers
at
this
store
with
this
high
of
abv
this
beer
was
surprisingly
smooth
with
a
lot
of
flavor
would
highly
recommend
especially
if
you
are
just
looking
to
have
a
couple
on
tap
at
the
airport
in
abe
wow
this
is
big
very
big
huge
banana
taste
lots
of
sweet
candied
sugar
flavors
with
hints
of
yeast
and
bread
seems
like
more
of
an
american
version
of
the
style
over
the
better
belgian
versions
its
good
just
hard
to
finish
since
i
am
not
familiar
with
the
style
maybe
this
is
right
on
i
will
finish
the
rest
of
the
4
pack
but
one
at
a
time
this
by
far
the
most
underrated
beer
i
have
ever
drank
i
think
it
was
excellent
on
all
phases
i
could
not
recommend
enough
nose
features
lots
of
sweet
malt
candied
dark
fruits
rum
and
a
touch
of
sour
that
fades
into
more
sweetness
taste
is
much
the
same
lots
of
malty
sweetness
candied
dark
fruits
dates
and
cherry
subtle
clove
like
spice
and
rum
booze
low
on
the
hop
and
bitter
as
expected
with
the
style
sweet
malty
and
a
nicely
masked
boozey
brew
given
the
abv
reddish
brown
color
almost
pink
grapefruit
when
held
to
light
with
very
little
head
candied
apples
stand
out
in
the
aroma
smooth
layered
taste
with
flashes
of
caramel
light
brown
sugar
spiced
rum
spices
vanilla
orange
cinnamon
clove
anise
cherry
cordial
plum
and
a
little
banana
bread
thin
syrupy
mouthfeel
with
average
carbonation
alcohol
is
very
well
hidden
not
earthshattering
but
a
decent
attempt
glad
i
bought
a
fourpack
packs
a
wallop
good
winter
beer
very
nice
belgian
hides
the
alcohol
well
and
is
an
easy
drinker
o
a
good
quad
but
not
my
favorite
improves
as
it
nears
room
temp
would
buy
again
but
there
are
others
i
would
buy
first
nice
color
head
dissipates
quickly
lots
of
flavors
from
malt
to
fruit
good
alcohol
warmth
and
very
smooth
a
definite
favorite
ill
add
to
my
list
of
must
have
again
overall
this
is
a
very
good
american
version
of
a
belgian
quad
very
true
to
the
style
and
delicious
im
certainly
getting
this
again
bottle
dated
111814
pours
brown
and
murky
with
a
small
head
that
fizzles
away
aroma
has
that
typical
belgian
yeast
spiciness
with
some
burnt
sugar
flavor
initially
follows
suit
but
then
plunges
into
a
phenolic
nastiness
took
two
swigs
once
while
cold
and
once
after
the
beer
had
warmed
up
a
considerably
sadly
i
had
to
drain
pour
this
beer
i
hate
bandaidey
phenolics
so
couldnt
even
choke
this
down
fills
a
goblet
with
a
murky
brown
thick
liquid
with
almost
no
head
despite
an
aggressive
pour
smell
is
lights
with
brown
sugar
raisan
and
alchohol
present
the
taste
is
sweet
on
the
front
end
with
brown
sugar
dried
fruits
and
then
a
moderate
alchohol
burn
on
the
back
end
this
had
the
creaminess
of
a
good
stout
ive
had
better
quads
but
overall
this
was
enjoyable
easy
to
drink
which
is
very
dangerous
considering
the
abv
smooth
taste
with
a
little
bit
of
a
strong
alcohol
taste
if
you
just
want
to
chill
out
with
1
or
2
beers
i
highly
recommend
this
enjoy
nice
solid
take
on
this
style
please
do
not
filter
this
beer
weyerbacher
o
a
tasty
amer
quad
with
fairly
good
complexity
and
balance
and
a
higher
abv
than
the
flavor
suggests
deep
garnet
orange
in
color
with
a
thick
viscous
appearance
poured
with
a
short
offwhite
foam
that
quickly
reduced
to
a
foamy
ring
ripe
apple
sweet
fig
and
banana
aromas
with
an
unmistakable
booziness
at
the
back
end
on
the
heavier
side
of
medium
bodied
with
a
smooth
oily
feel
in
the
middle
surrounded
by
light
but
tangy
carbonation
ripe
banana
and
dark
fruits
flavors
with
a
sticky
sweet
malt
backbone
tangy
hop
bitterness
through
the
middle
to
the
end
unmistakable
booziness
throughout
finished
semidryly
with
lingering
fruity
sweetness
and
earthy
yeasty
aftertaste
not
for
everyone
strong
alcohol
aftertaste
but
somewhat
fruity
apon
sip
i
found
it
to
taste
better
extremely
cold
it
really
does
remind
me
of
a
barely
wine
style
ale
but
if
u
wanna
get
hammered
with
a
six
pack
this
is
your
beer
if
u
can
handle
the
price
o
surprised
by
the
banana
presence
great
carbonation
very
enjoyable
overall
a
solid
beer
but
it
is
missing
that
punch
that
i
expect
from
a
quad
this
may
be
a
far
cry
from
my
favorite
quad
but
its
pretty
good
at
its
pricepoint
i
probably
should
have
bought
another
4
pack
for
the
cellar
because
i
think
this
will
do
nicely
with
some
age
to
calm
the
booze
o
this
brew
is
leaning
towards
being
a
bit
watery
in
both
feel
and
taste
nothing
offputting
but
there
are
certainly
better
quads
out
there
that
said
weyerbacher
makes
consistently
good
brews
pours
a
hazy
honey
orange
with
a
foamy
bone
head
that
settles
to
wisps
of
film
on
top
of
the
beer
tiny
dots
of
lace
form
around
the
glass
on
the
drink
down
smell
is
of
malt
caramel
honey
and
fruit
aromas
taste
is
much
the
same
with
slightly
sour
caramel
fruit
and
spice
flavors
on
the
finish
there
is
a
mild
amount
of
spice
bitterness
on
the
palate
with
each
sip
this
beer
has
a
lower
level
of
carbonation
with
a
slightly
crisp
and
sticky
mouthfeel
overall
this
is
a
pretty
good
beer
that
is
tasty
but
has
a
slightly
better
smell
in
my
opinion
overall
good
but
a
little
unrefined
youd
never
confuse
this
one
with
some
of
the
high
quality
belgian
quads
it
actually
has
some
barleywine
type
flavours
which
works
for
me
o
big
beer
that
doesnt
hit
you
until
about
midway
through
very
good
interpretation
of
the
style
for
being
a
mass
produced
american
quad
this
is
great
o
i
do
enjoy
how
pronounced
the
esters
are
and
that
the
alcohols
though
bold
and
apparent
are
kept
in
expert
control
lending
to
fantastic
balance
pretty
well
done
quad
according
to
my
tastes
in
quads
this
is
an
excellent
quad
but
i
think
that
quads
in
general
sacrifice
the
subtlety
of
a
tripel
for
higher
alcohol
content
i
would
pair
this
with
some
cheesecake
maybe
or
beef
stroganoff
it
could
definitely
clean
up
something
fatty
for
sure
overall
this
beer
being
my
first
quad

this
one
is
lacking
in
complexity
but
for
some
reason
the
alcohol
was
a
negative
factor
in
this
one
i
am
one
to
advocate
a
little
hotness
and
discernible
alcohol
sometimes
too
all
being
said
i
thought
it
was
an
above
average

a

the
taste
essentially
followed

with
a

finish
it
was
the
intensity
of
the
fruit
flavors
at
the
tale
end
of
each
sip
that
caused
me
to
deduct
points
for
taste
it
seemed
a
bit
out
of
proportion
in
relation
to
the
various
other
flavors
the
candy
and
honey
flavors
really
added
a
nice
sweet
touch
to
this
quadrupel
and
made
it
unique
in
that
is
created
a
flush
of
sweetness
all
over
my
tongue
in
the
first
few
sips
without
blowing
out
my
taste
buds
the
drinkability
is
high
with
this
beer
because
it
is
so
flavorful
and
enjoyable
and
the
alcohol
just
doesnt

than
quad
is
a

bagger

with
a
man
or
two
on
i
found
this
beer
very
raw
and
upfront
lots
of
sweetness
and
quite
yeasty
some
cheesyness
some
very
raw
peppery
alcohol
quite
sugary
not
very
elegant
or
rounded
or
anything
a
bit

sweet

raw
for
my

with

the

some
the

here
is
the
massive

presence
finshes
long
malty
with
plummypruney
notes
on
the
palate
with
more
alcohol
and
hop
sting
to
close
things
up
not
as
balanced
as
this
style
should
be
due
to
the
huge
amount
of
alcohol
contained
within
dont
smoke
near
this
one
still
one
brute
of
a

all
the
same
though
beware
its
mighty
power
this
beer
poured

color
that
was
somewhat
cloudy
in
the
first
pour
to
opaque
in
the
last
pour
the
head
was
creamy
and
beige
in
color
and
texture
it
was
a
head
that
when
first
poured
was
there
but
quickly
deminished
into
nothing
just
a
rim
on
the
edges
of
the
glass
there
was
lace
noticable
some
parts
were
sparce
and
hardly
there
but
other
parts
seemed
to
leave
a
sticky
residuelace
behind
the
aromas
that
came
from
the
glass
were
big
caramel
sweet
malts
fruits
2
kinds
dark
and
fresh
wood
and
of
course
alcohol
the
tastes
were
just
as
good
and
big
sweet
malts
fruit
soaked
in
alcohol
plums
and
raisins
floral
hops
alcohol
roasted
malts
and
apples
a
smooth
and
creamy
beer
that
sneaks
up
on
you
it
starts
off
sweet
then
hits
you
with
complex
flavors
and
heats
you
up
with
the
flame
from
the
alcohol
it
leaves
a
slight
dry
hop
aftertaste
but
is
shared
with
a
sweetness
to
leave
you
with
a
well
balanced
feeling
on
your
tongue
again
a
nice
and
complex
beer
that
surprised
me
i
have
had
good
beers
from
this
brewery
and
i
can
say
atleast
1
great
one
so
far
this
belgian
quadrupel
poured
a
cloudy
dark
amber
brown
color
with
thin
white
foam
the
smell
was
fruity
pears
apples
bananas
and
cloves
the
taste
was
rich
and
sweet
candy
sugar
and
fruity
apples
and
pears
and
malty
the
mouthfeel
was
full
bodied
and
smooth
and
creamy
this
was
a
very
nice
strong
ale
and
it
was
wonderfully
drinkable
though
potent
thanks
for
the
moonshine
davo
well
i
did
let
a
few
of
these
spend
a
year
untouched
what
a
great
thing
to
do
dusty
cherries
emerged
in
the
nose
and
a
lot
of
the
sweetness
went
away
to
reveal
white
pepper
during
the
finish
the
mouthfeel
became
creamier
good
stuff
a
fine
american
version
of
the
strong
dark
belgian
stylenot
cloying
and
not
overpoweringly
alcoholic
another
of
those
magnificent
beers
not
meant
for
the
light
beer
crowd
and
thankfully
so
the
12
1
percent
abv
is
noticeable
in
the
bitter
dry
aftertaste
ah
yes
sports
fans
another
of
those
over
the
top
bad
boys
that
most
people
frown
at
but
i
love
this
one
supplied
to
me
by
venom
about
a
year
ago
so
this
behemoth
has
grown
baby
whew
what
a
kick
in
the
arse
deep
copper
almost
ruby
in
appearance
with
a
tan
head
that
fades
to
nothing
smell
is
portlike
with
plum
caramel
and
unmistakable
alcohol
whoa
taste
is
also
portlike
very
strong
alcohol
almost
out
of
whack
very
sweet
alcohol
lingers
long
in
the
finish
i
respect
this
brew
but
ill
have
to
drink
a
few
more
before
i
decide
whether
i
like
it
another
wonderful
one
venom
cheers
appearance
pours
a
slightly
hazy
amberdark
brown
color
and
has
a
small
foamy
cardboard
colored
head
slow
carbonation
mouthfeel
is
fairly
smooth
on
the
nose
the
aroma
of
raisins
plums
rum
and
alcohol
on
the
palate
the
flavors
consisted
of
dark
fruits
burnt
sugers
raisins
plums
and
alcohol
this
tastes
much
better
when
it
is
aged
the
mouthfeel
is
incredible
the
alcohol
nose
is
almost
too
much
this
beer
is
almost
chewy
and
a
keeper
unlike
other
bourbonbarrel
aged
beers
blasphemy
never
becomes
too
boozey
this
is
still
definitely
rooted
in
the
belgian
quadrupel
style
with
the
aging
merely
adding
just
a
bit
of
heresy
if
youll
pardon
the
pun
a
very
nice
example
of
a
strongstyle
beer
from
a
brewery
that
seems
to
be
making
such
ales
their
trademark
blasphemy
has
a
bourbon
sherry
over
ripe
fruit
and
oak
nose
with
traces
of
light
caramel
and
vanilla
it
pours
hazy
tea
brown
over
a
thin
wisp
of
a
head
it
enters
with
sticky
sugar
and
a
little
oily
growing
quickly
to
big
fruity
alcohol
flavors
sherry
bourbon
and
a
little
alcohol
heat
on
the
finish
a
big
balsy
full
bodied
beer
with
average
carbonation
overall
i
had
this
a
bit
sooner
than
i
otherwise
wouldve
out
of
fear
of
infection
of
which
there
was
absolutely
no
hint
i
found
this
completely
delicious
and
very
enjoyable
and
certainly
holds
its
own
against
bbq
5
monks
or
not
the
stoic
not
in
my
personal
top
tier
of
ba
offerings
only
because
its
a
bit
onedimensional
but
for
the
style
it
ticks
all
the
boxes
and
does
so
with
some
panache
beautiful
pour
fluffy
thick
head
that
holds
well
unique
quad
smell
of
oats
and
bourbon
aging
taste
is
smooth
and
clean
not
overwhelmingly
alcoholic
an
amazing
beer
that
i
highly
recommend
if
you
come
across
blasphemy
grab
it
before
it
goes
o
this
is
another
massive
and
massively
enjoyable
offering
from
weyerbacher
the
more
i
contemplate
if
a
manhattan
and
a
belgian
dark
ale
produced
offspring
blasphemy
would
be
the
result
weyerbacher
knows
big
beers
and
their
barrelaging
program
is
sadly
overlooked
with
blasphemy
topping
the
list
whats
more
the
value
for
a
beer
of
this
magnitude
is
8bottle
and
cannot
think
of
a
better
bba
beer
for
that
value
now
if
they
barrelaged
tiny
and
merry
monks
as
well
i
just
may
not
seek
out
another
brewery
5
0
strange
quad
nutty
on
the
nose
with
banana
just
like
youd
expect
but
the
middle
is
sour
grapefruit
granny
smith
apples
hint
of
raisins
and
nuts
and
then
the
after
is
sour
and
a
bit
bitter
with
hops
but
not
overpowering
its
a
very
interesting
beer
and
definitely
worth
drinking
but
the
sourness
is
a
little
much
and
im
not
sure
id
buy
it
again
very
smooth
and
high
abv
is
well
hidden
lots
of
raisins
and
bread
pudding
flavors
loved
it
great
beer
fantastic
over
all
the
price
is
cheap
8
lot
of
alcohol
not
my
cup
of
brew
the
booziness
is
overpowering
hiding
the
quality
of
the
beer
also
felt
there
was
too
much
residualsweetness
this
is
a
medium
bodied
brew
with
a
modest
amount
of
carbonation
it
is
boozy
yet
some
of
that
is
hidden
by
the
excessive
amount
of
residual
sugar
after
drinking
some
of
this
i
could
not
tell
if
i
was
drunk
or
on
a
sugar
high
real
good
this
is
an
iffy
style
for
me
but
i
enjoyed
the
flavors
and
enjoyed
the
subtle
complexities
in
the
beer
the
beer
had
an
unexpected
thinness
watery
feel
too
it
more
noticeable
as
it
warmed
but
that
was
ok
on
the
other
hand
the
complexities
mellowed
as
well
and
since
the
style
and
abc
in
general
would
make
it
a
sipping
beer
for
me
this
prevented
it
from
a
higher
rating
bottle
poured
at
tipples
rare
and
barrel
aged
beer
tasting
on
july
13
2014
pours
a
lighter
amber
color
mostly
clear
with
a
creamy
off
white
head
on
top
smells
like
nearly
straight
neat
whiskey
booze
and
not
much
else
here
maybe
some
extra
sweetness
from
the
malts
flavor
is
a
bit
harsh
with
sweet
candi
sugar
light
spices
some
caramel
vanilla
and
lots
of
straight
phenolic
booziness
body
is
medium
not
standing
up
to
the
barrels
with
low
to
medium
carbonation
overall
this
was
a
bit
hot
for
me
with
the
whiskey
masking
the
nice
hearty
sweet
flavors
from
the
quad
o
this
is
pretty
good
like
many
murican
quads
it
lacks
that
special
something
to
rise
it
up
to
belgian
standards
and
not
even
barrel
aging
can
change
that
i
definitely
think
its
worth
a
try
though
i
mean
its
pretty
well
priced
as
far
as
a
barrelaged
beer
goes
just
dont
expect
brilliance
overall
not
bad
but
needs
3
years
to
calm
and
cool
down
o
a
sipping
beer
for
sure
weyerbacher
demonstrates
its
talents
with
maltier
ales
and
lives
up
to
what
a
quadruple
should
be
definitely
not
an
everyday
beer
heavy
and
rich
for
the
holidays
750ml
bottle
pours
a
murky
brown
with
a
half
inch
of
head
some
lacing
the
aroma
is
ripe
bananas
bubble
gum
and
cloves
not
really
smelling
any
of
the
whiskey
the
taste
is
really
where
the
whiskey
barrel
flavor
comes
out
banana
yeast
coriander
vanilla
cinnamon
and
cloves
booze
at
the
end
with
some
woody
notes
and
more
of
the
banana
whiskey
finish
lots
of
carbonation
its
an
interesting
mix
of
the
whiskey
flavors
and
the
typical
belgian
characteristics
pretty
decent
price
too
overall
intriguing
beer
id
grab
again
o
a
pretty
solid
beer
overall
and
very
reasonably
priced
id
like
a
bit
more
belgian
flavor
and
aroma
but
the
whiskey
rules
still
whats
there
is
good
overall
definitely
like
this
definitely
expect
to
be
feeling
this
bottle
later
on
overall
i
would
like
to
try
the
base
beer
before
it
is
aged
in
bourbon
barrels
for
a
comparison
either
or
and
they
both
would
be
awesome
overall
this
is
an
outstanding
beer
weyerbacher
always
does
magical
things
when
they
oak
age
any
of
their
brews
the
only
thing
i
see
any
setbacks
with
this
brew
is
the
appearance
this
is
too
clean
to
be
a
quad
it
might
be
from
me
grading
it
on
the
first
half
since
this
is
the
750ml
corked
and
caged
i
was
looking
forward
to
an
ugly
brew
yet
i
found
a
clean
quad
other
than
the
appearance
i
found
this
to
be
enjoyable
o
next
spring
i
will
buy
a
dozen
of
these
really
outstanding
a
great
experience
highly
recommended
overall
another
solid
beer
from
weyerbacher
strays
away
from
a
traditional
quad
but
still
a
really
good
beer
pours

is
just
a
bit
thinner
than
expected

a
good
deal
for
the
price
d
really
impressed
with
this
brew
from
weyerbacher
this
and
their
insanity
are
two
top
notch
bourbon
barrel
aged
brews
imo
got
another
one
in
the
cellar
should
be
really
good
in
about
a
year
after
some
of
the
heat
has
perhaps
dissipated
ill
report
back
perhaps
the
most
enjoyable
brew
ive
had
from
weyerbacher
a
marked
improvement
on
the
base
quad
and
a
good
value
for
a
barrel
aged
beer
this
will
certainly
be
a
repeat

me

i
was
really
excited
for
this
beer
when
i
bought
it
a
barrel
aged
quad
mmmm
it
pours
a
beautiful
redish
gold
color
with
about
a
half
inch
head
smell
is
strong
bourbon
with
notes
of
fruit
like
plums
figs
orange
and
maybe
a
little
banana
mouthfeel
is
good
not
overly
carbonated
with
a
smooth
finish
taste
is
sweet
just
sweet
i
couldnt
get
past
the
sweetness
to
really
taste
anything
else
there
a
strong
bourbon
aftertaste
but
its
just
way
too
sweet
had
trouble
finishing
it
honestly
i
was
disappointed
with
the
taste
i
love
the
smell
it
has
a
fruity
smell
and
makes
me
want
to
drink
it
bottle
from
proof
bottle
shop
pours
a
hazy
brown
with
a
tinge
of
red
cream
colored
head
that
lasted
pretty
well
collar
persistedthroughout
the
entire
bomber
aroma
is
mostly
fig
and
red
grape
with
lots
of
molasses
and
whiskey
booziness
to
it
taste
is
almost
the
exact
same
but
with
some
vanilla
and
cherry
as
well
mouthfeel
is
enjoyably
boozy
the
booziness
that
detracts
from
the
taste
and
smell
is
airy
and
pungent
on
the
tongue
im
glad
ive
got
a
few
more
of
these
for
this
winter
and
next
winter
im
hoping
the
booze
subsides
and
morphs
into
something
else
o
very
nice
brew
especially
if
you
like
a
stronger
abv
with
some
sweetness
i
enjoyed
this
one
quite
a
bit
i
wished
it
was
in
12
oz
bottle
to
make
smaller
portions
easier
o
i
know
this
beer
is
almost
12
abv
but
the
alcohol
isnt
hidden
too
well
this
is
the
only
thing
preventing
this
beer
from
being
really
good
overall
this
is
a
strong
boozy
and
sweet
beer
a
little
to
sweet
and
boozy
for
my
tastes
but
if
you
like
a
beer
ages
in
whiskey
barrels
this
is
a
good
one
to
try
overall
this
is
a
very
nice
beer
thats
definitely
on
the
sweet
side
a
lot
of
quads
are
too
sweet
for
my
taste
this
one
is
borderline
it
could
use
a
stronger
whiskey
andor
hop
presence
but
its
still
a
complex
enjoyable
beer
overall
this
is
a
really
big
quad
really
boozey
id
be
curious
what
a
little
time
could
do
to
it
this
is
great
its
kind
of
like
a
low
abv
bourbon
boilermaker
the
bourbon
flavors
and
aromas
are
extremely
prevalent
they
mingle
well
with
the
belgian
yeasty
flavors
ones
would
expect
from
a
quadruple
this
is
perfect
harmony
the
hops
keep
the
sweet
bourbon
flavors
in
check
while
the
malt
is
all
smooth
and
graceful
alcohol
is
a
little
strong
on
the
nose
but
its
well
hidden
on
the
tongue
this
was
only
9
for
a
something
that
is
aged
2
years
they
could
easily
charge
more
but
they
dont
you
have
to
try
this
if
you
like
beer
and
you
like
bourbon
o
this
beer
is
boozy
as
all
hell
predictably
not
bad
though
let
it
warm
up
a
real
powerhouse
quad
pretty
good
but
not
fantastic
definitely
worth
trying
and
weyerbacher
rarely
disappoints
but
there
are
some
other
quads
id
take
before
this
and
definitely
other
offerings
from
weyerbacher
id
go
for
but
i
will
enjoy
finish
this
one
it
pours
a
dark
reddish
color
nice
when
held
up
to
the
light
with
a
thin
head
of
khaki
foam
the
aroma
is
really
nice
with
big
notes
of
plum
raisin
cinnamon
vanilla
wood
and
bourbon
very
inviting
the
flavor
is
very
sweet
with
sugar
plums
alcohol
caramel
wood
and
a
lot
of
vanilla
in
the
finish
warming
and
fruity
with
some
cinnamon
but
a
bit
too
sweet
in
the
finish
for
my
tastes
overallbetter
than
most
beer
with
such
a
high
abv
the
sweetness
manages
to
prevent
it
from
being
too
overwhelming
but
i
will
probably
stick
to
tripels
and
dubbels
in
the
future
really
great
quad
poured
on
the
warm
side
too
long
out
of
the
fridge
with
a
smallish
somewhat
fizzy
tan
head
and
no
lace
color
is
a
clear
orange
amber
brown
with
no
bubble
trails
aroma
is
malt
sherry
dark
ripe
fruit
with
a
little
oak
and
vanilla
flavors
much
like
nose
with
sweet
front
and
center
tapered
with
some
bitter
and
a
tiny
bit
of
tang
body
is
good
full
and
round
true
to
style
but
carbonation
is
a
little
soft
finish
is
like
flavor
lingering
and
has
no
off
characteristics
although
the
alcohol
give
only
the
barest
hint
of
the
power
good
beer
but
a
little
does
go
for
a
distance
its
a
boozy
beer
with
a
bit
of
caramel
its
not
deep
in
its
flavor
with
low
carbonation
it
almost
tastes
like
a
barrel
aged
doppelbock
if
anything
definitely
a
sipper
and
lacks
sweetness
o
big
and
boozy
but
far
superior
to
the
12
oz
capped
bottle
being
much
richer
and
more
flavorful
o
having
had
their
quad
quadrupel
i
find
this
to
be
very
similar
but
with
the
additional
of
barrel
aging
which
produces
that
telltale
whiskey
barrel
flavor
overlay
certainly
serves
the
beer
well
a
bit
better
than
their
quad
but
again
i
find
the
beer
to
be
good
but
without
the
benefit
of
anything
to
really
demand
your
attention
o
i
really
enjoyed
this
beer
its
not
like
any
quad
ive
ever
had
this
reminds
me
of
sipping
a
class
of
scotch
definitely
to
be
enjoyed
slowly
with
some
friends
nice
appearance
opaque
murky
wonderful
brown
aroma
yes
this
has
it
previously
mentioned
insane
lovely
whiskey
like
the
crown
royal
ive
been
sipping
on
since
christmas
taste
yes
its
got
that
too
fruits
whiskey
vanilla
oak
wood
sweets
apples
pears
and
cherries
with
a
wonderful
exquisite
bitter
tart
finish
with
more
sweetness
like
a
slam
dunkel
on
steriods
probably
why
i
like
this
beer
so
much
the
recently
retired
dunkel
was
always
a
favorite
i
will
seek
this
one
out
again
as
in
today
its
pretty
damn
good
at
a
great
price
for
barrel
aged
deliciousness
weyerbacher
killing
it
as
always
o
this
is
a
great
interpretation
of
the
style
but
i
much
prefer
a
straight
up
quad
to
one
thats
been
aged
in
bourbonwhiskeyscotch
barrels
o
a
boozy
but
not
overpowering
beeri
wish
there
was
more
of
a
barrel
presence
but
its
a
really
nice
beer
nonetheless
mdo
too
much
burn
for
a
high
mouthfeel
score
some
decent
fruits
and
sweet
malts
underneath
the
11
8
gets
better
as
it
warms
in
my
glass
though
maybe
i
put
too
much
age
on
this
one
but
i
think
its
ok
quality
wise
a
decent
quad
but
wont
compare
to
the
european
versions
of
course
but
apporaching
benchmark
for
american
versions
d
this
one
sat
in
the
cellar
for
close
to
a
year
but
this
one
has
a
bit
too
much
heat
bourbon
barrel
aging
can
either
add
nuance
or
overpower
and
distract
from
the
rest
of
the
beer
unfortunately
it
serves
as
a
big
distraction
and
creates
a
lot
of
unpleasant
noise
for
an
otherwise
solid
offering
ill
take
the
standard
version
weyerbacher
quad
any
day
of
the
week
about
as
nice
a
bourbon
barrel
quad
as
you
might
ever
ask
for
hardywood
park
bourbon
cru
anyone
really
outstanding
o
well
done
beer
and
one
of
my
favorites
of
the
year
so
far
it
can
stand
up
to
a
good
belgian
quad
it
will
also
please
your
palate
now
or
stand
up
to
some
good
cellaring
for
later
opoor
balance
alcohol
head
this
beer
was
not
that
good
and
it
had
been
aged
for
a
few
months
was
expecting
better
o
i
dont
drink
too
many
quads
but
this
was
pretty
good
maybe
a
bit
hot
with
the
alcohol
but
other
than
that
i
enjoyed
the
complexities
of
this
beer
very
nice
a
touch
too
much
booze
but
great
flavor
nice
and
sugary
true
to
style
o
i
had
high
hopes
and
was
a
total
let
down
ive
never
had
a
purple
beer
that
i
can
recall
and
was
just
too
sweet
for
me
definitely
something
different
and
unlike
any
other
quad
ive
had
before
o
i
held
on
to
this
for
a
few
months
but
its
still
pretty
hot
and
messy
i
would
say
that
i
should
have
let
it
go
even
longer
but
then
the
carbonation
would
have
faded
even
more
when
its
already
lacking
in
that
area
i
think
i
just
prefer
the
quad
which
is
the
base
beer
of
this
aged
offering
in
its
original
form
o
ok
ba
quad
a
little
thin
and
dry
with
less
sweetness
and
barrel
character
than
i
would
like
o
i
wanted
to
be
blown
away
by
this
beer
i
was
not
its
still
a
solid
tasty
brew
but
nothing
mindblowing
o
has
this
strange
flavor
quality
that
i
have
found
in
other
weyerbacher
beers
that
i
cant
really
describe
very
well
comes
together
a
little
better
as
it
warms
up
not
the
most
amazing
quad
and
definitely
not
the
best
bourbon
barrel
aged
quad
yet
it
is
worth
another
look
at
again
in
the
futre
i
will
definitely
start
the
bottle
quite
a
bit
warmer
than
i
did
this
one
good
stuff
i
never
got
a
chance
to
try
their
quad
so
i
cant
compare
as
far
as
the
differences
the
barrel
aging
brings
but
a
very
nice
and
unique
quad
in
its
own
right
pretty
sweet
even
for
this
style
and
may
be
a
little
tough
to
make
it
through
the
750ml
on
my
own
monstrous
beer
too
every
bit
of
the
11
8
abv
this
sucker
will
give
you
the
hiccups
and
put
you
to
sleep
this
was
a
little
better
than
what
i
was
expecting
from
the
reviews
it
is
big
and
warm
but
the
flavors
are
very
good
goes
to
show
you
need
to
make
up
your
own
mind
o
tasty
goes
down
ok
not
too
filling
very
strong
kick
good
representation
of
style
its
a
decent
sipper
but
can
be
a
bit
overpowering
and
there
are
better
choices
within
in
the
style
but
beyond
that
this
blasphemer
is
damnably
delicious
id
be
best
off
with
a
smaller
sample
maybe
or
share
with
friends
but
i
had
to
take
this
one
down
by
myself
ive
got
probably
eight
ounces
to
go
and
its
getting
louder
in
here
boomboompbbomboom
o
not
too
impressed
but
i
am
not
a
quad
expert
to
begin
with
barrel
aging
helped
calm
things
down
a
bit
but
i
would
recommend
the
cellar
treatment
for
a
year
or
2
overall
a
wonderful
sipper
with
some
big
flavor
sit
sip
chat
with
a
good
pal
and
enjoy
its
delicious
i
poured
from
a
bomber2012
into
a
snifter
the
pour
is
murky
decent
head
nice
lacing
the
aroma
is
boozy
fruity
bourbon
the
taste
is
boozey
lots
of
dark
fruit
hints
of
bourbon
the
finish
is
boozey
the
body
is
full
alcohol
is
very
noticeable
good
carbonation
a
good
quad
bourbon
barrel
should
have
added
more
perhaps
some
more
time
in
the
bottle
would
add
more
o
it
probably
wont
win
any
awards
it
wont
generate
hype
or
have
beer
geeks
sweeping
it
off
the
shelves
in
fact
at
the
end
of
the
day
its
a
pretty
average
bourbon
barrel
aged
quad
not
very
complex
and
a
little
rough
around
the
edges
a
touch
hot
but
not
quite
enough
to
be
offensive
but
at
8
for
a
750ml
bottle
i
feel
as
though
i
got
my
moneys
worth
maybe
im
just
in
a
glass
half
full
kind
of
mood
today
o
this
is
a
hard
style
but
i
think
weyerbacher
is
near
the
top
here
this
is
a
little
astringent
and
dry
due
to
the
boozy
finish
the
nose
though
is
excellent
and
the
flavors
are
well
rounded
very
good
example
of
a
ba
quad
here
3
5
d
this
is
a
tasty
beer
but
it
cant
compare
to
the
subtlety
driven
quads
out
of
belgium
while
the
bourbon
makes
this
a
fun
change
from
the
usual
its
not
something
id
come
back
to
again
and
again
overall
these
are
my
guilty
pleasure
giant
boozy
sugar
bomb
quads
i
know
its
not
what
a
great
quad
should
taste
like
i
love
those
too
but
its
still
like
drinking
candy
o
this
is
a
tasty
brew
although
it
reminds
me
of
a
barley
wine
more
than
a
quad
i
think
it
needs
a
little
more
to
balance
the
sweetness
this
is
a
sipper
for
sure
give
it
a
go
o
this
was
a
decent
beer
a
sipper
to
be
sure
but
i
wouldnt
pick
it
up
all
the
time
definitely
not
overly
impressed
o
a
solid
example
of
an
americanbrewed
barrelaged
quad
the
barrel
merely
compliments
the
solid
base
beer
a
nice
sipper
and
one
that
should
age
very
nicely
skål
overall
one
of
my
favorite
bourbon
barrel
aged
beers
putting
a
few
away
for
aging
should
get
better
with
time
another
great
beer
for
wheyerbacher
poured
into
a
tulip
glass
solid
copper
color
with
a
decent
two
finger
head
fusel
alcohols
and
belgian
sugar
in
the
nose
the
favor
is
too
sweet
there
are
a
bunch
of
unfemented
sugars
in
there
a
sipper
to
say
the
least
big
malt
body
and
little
to
no
hop
pressence
carbonation
is
fine
for
the
style
but
i
would
compare
it
to
an
old
ale
or
old
stock
ale
more
than
a
quad
not
a
friend
of
this
brew
overall
a
big
pleasant
surprise
i
expected
a
passable
quad
very
nice
overall
i
really
like
this
beer
sure
it
doesnt
have
a
ton
of
dark
fruit
character
but
it
is
a
great
high
abv
quite
that
hides
it
quite
well
worth
a
try
while
its
no
insanity
i
would
say
weyerbacher
proved
themselves
barrel
aging
masters
with
the
recent
insanity
batch
of
which
ive
bought
about
a
case
already
and
will
buy
more
until
it
disappears
from
stores
its
a
tasty
beer
at
a
great
price
overall
this
one
is
decent
im
enjoying
it
although
im
by
no
means
wowed
worth
a
try
as
a
sidebar
its
getting
to
the
point
where
to
me
there
should
be
two
separate
styles
belgian
andor
trappist
quad
vs
americanelsewhere
there
are
some
tasty
renditions
within
the
latter
category
but
ive
yet
to
find
anything
that
can
approach
the
powerhouses
that
reside
under
the
banner
of
the
former
o
pretty
decent
american
quad
actually
a
nice
quad
flavor
blends
smoothly
with
whiskey
barrels
really
good
flavors
its
pretty
sweet
and
fruity
for
a
quad
but
it
melds
very
well
with
big
bourbon
flavors
may
pick
up
one
to
age
blasphemy
is
one
of
the
aces
in
weyerbachers
deck
looking
at
past
reviews
and
thinking
about
past
drinks
i
have
to
concede
to
the
fact
that
weyerbacher
is
one
of
my
favorite
alltime
breweries
they
do
great
things
and
then
they
do
notsogreat
things
surprisingly
well
id
have
to
be
one
broke
mofo
if
i
see
this
on
a
shelf
and
dont
pick
it
up
another
notch
in
the
belt
for
weyerbacher
im
sure
as
they
must
know
theyre
killing
it
smooth
and
much
lighter
bodied
then
expected
super
fruity
and
complex
dark
fruits
raisins
currants
rolls
into
this
sweet
vanilla
infused
berry
marmalade
as
the
oak
takes
over
bourbon
comes
through
just
enough
to
let
you
know
its
there
sweet
belgian
candi
sugar
notes
make
a
suprise
appearance
on
the
back
end
finish
consists
of
a
drying
touch
of
oak
making
this
one
of
the
smoothest
quads
bourbon
barrel
aged
beers
and
above
11
abv
brews
ive
ever
had
go
wyerbacher
this
beer
is
ready
to
drink
and
one
of
weyerbachers
cleanest
tasting
offerings
yet
afterthought
it
kind
of
tastes
like
a
whiskey
and
coke
with
crappy
whiskey
so
still
not
bad
o
this
is
sweet
enough
to
be
a
dessert
beer
this
might
work
in
small
quantities
but
gets
tiring
after
more
than
6oz
overall
this
was
a
meh
beer
for
me
seemingly
average
for
the
style
ive
had
worse
and
better
with
almost
a
year
on
it
i
had
hoped
the
etoh
would
have
died
down
a
bit
more
as
there
seems
to
be
a
solid
flavor
profile
lurking
in
the
background
i
just
wished
it
had
thickened
up
a
bit
and
brought
the
intended
flavors
to
the
forefront
more
still
another
new
brew
to
me
that
im
happy
to
have
tried
m
nice
creamy
wellbalanced
o
hard
call
this
a
quad
but
its
a
pretty
nice
beer
pretty
hot
will
save
my
other
bottle
for
at
least
a
year
do
very
intoxicating
high
drinkability
considering
the
abv
every
here
enjoyed
it
right
up
there
with
boulevards
offering
as
the
best
bourbon
barrel
quad
that
ive
had
thanks
a
bunch
maxspang
this
was
an
interesting
beer
i
could
definitely
tell
the
barrel
aging
added
some
vanilla
flavor
and
probably
some
booze
i
think
this
might
have
been
a
little
better
with
some
age
on
it
to
better
meld
the
alcohol
maybe
ill
pick
up
another
bottle
to
do
that
weyerbacher
continues
to
impress
me
what
an
awesome
brewery
750
ml
caged
and
corked
bottle
2011
vintage
served
in
a
dogfish
head
signature
glass
the
beer
pours
a
murky
brownishred
color
with
about
a
half
inch
offwhite
head
that
went
away
quickly
not
much
lacing
at
all
aroma
is
very
nice
it
smells
like
dark
fruit
bourbon
vanilla
caramel
sweet
apples
and
some
brandy
the
taste
is
pretty
much
like
the
aroma
the
brew
tastes
like
dark
fruit
raisins
plums
figs
caramel
bourbon
vanilla
oak
booze
and
candy
sugar
mouthfeelbody
is
full
its
coating
and
thick
with
low
carbonation
i
think
this
is
a
good
beer
overall
and
for
just
7
99
a
bottle
id
definitely
buy
this
again
its
certainly
a
bargain
for
the
price
i
am
very
impressed
with
this
quad
i
believe
its
my
first
of
this
style
very
unique
strong
and
definitely
a
sipper
i
am
glad
i
stored
this
in
my
closet
for
about
five
months
to
soften
the
alcohol
blow
i
learned
my
lesson
from
weyerbachers
tiny
not
to
drink
it
right
away
and
yet
i
do
big
punch
of
booze
to
start
out
with
waves
of
dates
figs
and
plums
still
bringing
some
heat
after
all
these
years
but
it
does
manage
to
get
down
the
heat
refuses
to
die
the
entire
glass
a
constant
reminder
of
the
likely
damage
being
done
inside
my
body
hot
mouthfeel
that
tingles
and
burns
in
a
way
that
i
feel
a
bit
uncomfortable
about
like
watching
porn
with
your
uncle
no
your
uncle
weyerbacher
blasphemy
pours
hazy
and
is
somewhere
between
brown
and
maroon
there
are
very
nice
light
red
highlights
shining
through
the
bone
colored
head
is
barely
there
fades
quickly
and
doesnt
leave
a
stitch
of
lacing
a
disappointment
all
around
although
i
do
have
to
cut
the
beer
just
a
little
slack
on
this
count
due
to
the
prodigious
alcohol
level
the
barrel
aging
is
readily
apparent
in
he
aroma
notes
of
caramel
and
vanilla
immediately
jump
out
before
fading
in
with
some
dark
berry
and
fruit
smells
the
nose
is
balanced
in
equal
measure
by
a
spicy
phenolic
character
and
a
warming
bourbon
and
boozy
note
which
could
stand
to
be
a
little
more
subdued
the
flavor
works
off
that
blueprint
but
dials
up
the
alcoholic
heat
and
bourbon
even
a
bit
more
the
plum
and
raisin
flavors
up
front
dont
seem
as
dark
and
intense
as
they
normally
are
the
peppery
phenols
are
there
but
largely
drowned
out
by
the
hot
alcohol
aspect
of
the
beer
the
body
is
somewhat
full
though
also
somewhat
dried
out
for
a
12
beer
and
nicely
creamy
its
aided
by
an
expansive
yet
subdued
carbonation
i
had
high
expectations
for
blasphemy
as
i
think
belgian
style
beers
do
better
in
bourbon
barrels
than
a
lot
of
brewers
realize
and
i
think
weyerbacher
does
some
great
barrel
aging
heresy
and
especially
insanity
this
one
though
was
definitely
a
bit
underwhelming
i
chalk
it
up
more
to
the
base
beer
than
the
barrel
aging
overall
this
could
have
sat
for
a
while
the
11
8
abv
acts
like
a
watered
down
liquor
on
the
throat
there
are
some
great
aromas
but
the
taste
is
just
very
under
ripe
cheers
overall
while
still
a
little
on
the
sweet
end
it
is
amazing
how
much
better
the
barrelaging
made
this
beer
overall
it
is
enjoyable
and
definitely
a
sipping
beer
big
full
nose
and
taste
i
particularly
liked
how
they
integrated
the
bourbon
barrel
without
it
overpowering
the
other
flavors
overall
all
in
all
i
dont
really
care
for
it
i
do
quite
like
some
aspects
of
it
though
the
raisiny
and
yeasty
smellsflavors
are
good
and
the
barrel
aging
seems
to
have
done
the
beer
well
however
like
the
regular
quad
this
thing
is
a
hot
boozy
mess
pours
a
cloudy
light
copper
with
a
huge
head
and
sticky
lace
smells
of
candy
apples
and
mild
spices
taste
is
massively
fruity
lots
of
fresh
apples
raisins
mild
mulled
spices
just
a
bit
of
alcohol
candy
sugar
and
a
hint
of
dark
caramel
feels
dense
yet
a
bit
fizzy
overall
a
nice
quad
and
it
pairs
well
with
cheese
overall
a
nice
brew
if
your
in
the
mood
for
sweet
and
mellow
overall
this
beer
is
intimidating
to
say
the
least
when
you
look
at
the
bottle
they
have
the
raven
and
a
cross
for
a
reason
when
you
read
11
8abv
it
will
scare
you
and
we
were
scared
yes
i
cried
a
little
however
the
feel
the
taste
and
the
overall
appearance
lead
this
to
be
a
very
good
example
of
a
quad
although
this
is
released
seldom
get
your
hands
on
this
and
give
it
a
try
fuller
medium
body
decent
carbonation
sticky
and
full
on
the
tongue
this
bottle
definitely
benefited
from
about
6
months
of
age
as
the
harsh
boozy
tones
mellowed
out
and
allowed
the
fruit
and
oak
flavors
to
shine
through
im
glad
i
have
another
bottle
or
two
o
if
you
like
whiskey
or
scotch
i
think
you
will
really
really
like
this
beer
it
is
very
bold
in
its
alcohol
content
and
it
comes
through
in
the
smell
and
the
taste
without
holding
back
it
is
balanced
out
with
a
little
bit
of
fruit
o
i
think
ive
had
this
bottle
for
a
while
but
i
really
like
this
beer
in
a
strange
way
a
very
good
quad
from
weyerbacher
love
the
style
and
this
one
definitely
holds
its
own
o
this
is
the
first
quad
that
i
have
really
enjoyed
a
lot
of
nice
things
going
on
but
just
too
boozy
to
be
thoroughly
enjoyed
very
good
stuff
here
nice
balance
and
flavors
overy
nice
quad
another
weyerbacher
beer
not
meant
for
anything
but
sipping
savoring
and
enjoying
this
is
a
good
beer
to
have
cold
or
room
temperature
ours
was
cold
and
as
the
night
went
on
it
came
to
room
temp
and
we
all
notices
that
more
flavors
released
as
it
came
up
to
temp
2011
bottle
poured
into
chimay
goblet
pours
a
murky
brown
with
a
reddish
tone
small
white
head
that
reduces
to
the
glass
edge
smells
of
sweet
caramel
fruit
and
alcohol
tastes
of
sweet
banana
and
other
dark
type
fruit
at
first
no
denying
theres
lots
of
belgian
yeast
oak
and
vanilla
flavors
as
well
very
complex
and
lots
going
on
but
flavors
are
short
lived
due
to
the
booziness
that
follows
immediately
after
medium
bodied
with
little
carbonation
truthfully
had
a
hard
time
finishing
i
would
definitely
share
and
age
the
next
one
to
mellow
out
that
alcohol
burn
this
could
be
a
high
rating
beer
at
the
right
age
especially
for
the
price
o
this
is
a
nice
rich
sweet
sipper
very
complex
with
a
lot
of
sweet
notes
some
of
which
i
cant
decipher
nicely
done
oakaging
weyerbacher
did
this
one
just
right
overall
this
is
a
really
satisfying
beer
with
a
great
value
though
i
couldnt
drink
it
very
often
notes
maybe
not
a
brew
for
the
ages
but
in
general
they
do
their
barrel
aging
fairly
well
in
a
soft
almost
subdued
manner
that
actually
works
pretty
well
this
is
a
quality
and
nice
take
at
aging
a
us
quad
and
worth
the
occasion
ive
had
this
once
before
and
really
enjoyed
it
here
goes
pours
a
very
dark
brown
almost
a
mud
color
into
my
tulip
glass
smell
is
strongly
of
alcohol
i
dont
remember
that
from
last
time
some
fruit
like
raisins
or
hell
i
dont
know
the
taste
is
somewhat
sweet
with
a
slight
fruitness
there
is
definitely
a
noticeable
alcohol
burn
as
an
aftertaste
but
thats
not
a
bad
thing
here
i
dig
it
this
beer
is
thick
and
creamy
a
lot
going
on
here
i
will
get
another
couple
of
these
soon
at
under
7
for
a
750
ml
bottle
this
beer
is
a
steal
o
a
very
tasty
brew
and
a
good
value
from
one
of
my
favorite
breweries
glad
they
brought
this
one
back
so
i
could
try
it
the
base
quad
is
one
of
the
best
if
not
the
best
besides
three
philosophers
of
the
american
style
and
i
am
glad
the
barrel
aging
helped
make
it
a
more
striking
beer
o
barrel
is
well
integrated
more
oak
than
bourbon
and
was
a
great
beer
to
get
to
have
really
looking
forward
to
how
aging
works
this
one
out
o
overall
a
good
beer
i
like
my
barrel
aged
beers
with
a
lot
of
barrel
this
has
the
sweetness
and
the
barrel
character
bt
a
touch
too
sweet
all
in
all
im
glad
dan
made
this
again
it
gives
me
another
tick
and
it
shows
what
chops
the
brewers
in
easton
have
i
dont
think
this
spent
a
whole
lot
of
time
in
the
barrels
but
enough
to
keep
the
bourbon
from
overpowering
the
base
quad
id
drank
it
again
o
well
integrated
barrel
profile
and
nicely
done
over
all
but
a
bit
overly
sweet
are
rough
around
the
edges
im
going
to
bet
with
some
time
down
this
would
be
amazing
overall
impression
a
bit
too
hot
and
almost
too
sweet
but
the
complexity
trumps
out
in
the
end
overall
i
would
buy
again
it
is
a
good
beer
to
sip
and
enjoy
slowly
o
at
first
i
was
disappointed
with
this
one
but
as
it
warmed
and
the
flavors
and
aromas
opened
up
it
became
quite
good
o
tasty
quad
not
up
to
the
level
of
some
of
the
frontrunners
but
i
enjoyed
this
one
would
definitely
like
to
have
it
again
a
great
beer
i
need
to
buy
another
to
age
lighter
body
carbonation
is
pretty
low
this
is
a
bit
hot
and
has
some
amazing
cellar
potential
very
well
made
overall
great
beer
nice
bourbon
and
whisky
flavors
nice
oak
rounding
great
malts
and
sweet
syrups
and
hint
of
fruit
and
bitterness
a
nice
aged
taste
too
the
aging
did
this
very
well
as
the
booze
quieted
down
the
malts
aged
nicely
and
the
bourbon
stayed
a
nice
flavor
but
not
too
hot
o
a
very
nice
brew
from
weyerbacher
that
i
will
definitely
look
for
again
not
quite
world
class
but
i
really
enjoyed
it
just
a
touch
away
from
4
5
in
a
lot
of
areas
cheers
drinkabilityoverall
this
beer
to
me
was
extremely
drinkable
because
the
alcohol
is
so
well
hidden
and
the
flavor
was
just
so
yummy
i
already
was
big
fan
in
the
past
of
the
weyer
quad
but
this
takes
it
to
and
all
new
level
really
happy
i
made
this
purchase
and
will
probably
seek
out
a
few
more
bottles
to
me
this
is
another
example
of
how
much
i
love
and
how
well
done
barrel
age
beers
can
be
when
done
right
in
the
words
of
borat
great
success
the
huge
flavor
makes
me
a
fan
as
does
the
8
price
tag
for
a
750
such
a
flavorful
and
well
priced
beer
i
will
be
getting
more
for
sure
o
this
seems
to
be
lacking
refinement
perhaps
if
it
was
laid
down
for
a
few
years
it
would
smooth
out
right
now
its
too
hot
and
carbonation
is
a
little
rough
i
originally
wrote
that
it
might
help
to
throw
it
in
a
barrel
for
a
while
then
realized
once
it
warmed
up
that
they
had
done
exactly
that
maybe
let
it
sit
for
a
while
longer
jus
sayin
o
very
well
done
and
im
glad
i
have
a
few
more
of
these
to
enjoy
over
the
next
few
years
definitely
worth
a
try
if
you
like
barrel
aged
quads
overall
at
9
for
a
750
of
a
barrel
aged
quad
this
is
a
great
value
i
would
recommend
this
beer
pretty
much
on
that
alone
however
it
is
a
very
tasty
and
enjoyable
beer
overall
its
good
would
love
to
see
what
some
more
time
would
do
to
this
one
d
overall
a
nice
bourbon
aged
quad
that
i
would
have
no
problem
going
back
for
another
bottle
or
two
i
really
enjoyed
the
boozy
presence
and
enjoying
the
bottle
over
the
course
of
a
couple
hours
this
beer
pours
as
a
brownish
copper
color
with
not
much
head
on
it
the
alcohol
must
kill
it
off
right
away
the
appearance
isnt
too
bad
but
its
not
great
either
the
aromas
are
boozey
and
doesnt
have
a
whole
lot
more
to
be
said
other
than
some
malts
in
there
and
a
little
wood
from
the
barrel
aging
the
taste
is
strong
with
alcohol
and
hasnt
got
much
of
the
elements
of
a
good
quad
its
missing
complexity
on
this
level
not
really
sure
why
the
mouthfeel
is
a
little
light
too
this
should
be
much
thicker
i
think
and
should
be
a
little
more
complex
with
some
dark
fruits
in
there
and
what
not
i
wouldnt
go
so
far
as
to
say
that
an
oakaged
quad
is
blasphemy
this
beer
proves
it
its
not
a
bad
release
from
weyerbacher
but
a
couple
of
tweaks
would
go
a
long
way
personally
i
think
itd
benefit
from
more
aromatics
more
body
and
less
alcohol
i
also
wouldnt
mind
a
little
belgian
yeast
having
said
that
its
definitely
an
interesting
beer
thats
aged
pretty
well
over
the
last
two
or
three
years
thanks

take

away
to
the

finish
has
lots
of
lingering
fruity
sweetness
and
plenty
of
rummy
warmth
more
sweet
than
bourbony
but
the
bourbon
and
oak
definitely
play
a
role
fullbodied
with
a
slick
feel
big
bold
and
definitely
a
sipper
very
sweet
with
again
a
lot
of
boozy
heat
as
well
as
a
lot
of
dark
fruit
oak
and
vanilla
im
picking
up
hints
of
raisin
plum
and
dark
cherries
and
more
boozy
heat
in
the
warm
finish
drinkability
very
very
drinkable
for
such
a
high
abv
a
little
sweet
for
my
liking
but
an
overall
great
beer
d
i
can
definitely
tell
this
is
a
sipper
from
the
presence
of
the
alcohol
but
at
the
same
time
i
just
want
to
keep
drinking
it
because
of
the
smoothness
and
good
balance
of
flavors
i
like
the
way
this
beer
feels
in
general
but
for
the
style
i
have
had
american
quads
with
more
body
that
i
like
more
this
is
decent
though
but
looses
its
malty
focus
because
the
malt
isnt
heavy
enough
to
ground
everything
carbonation
is
nice
and
the
finish
has
some
great
lingering
flavors
but
a
touch
too
much
noticeable
alcohol
overall
i
enjoyed
this
beer
and
would
drink
it
again
its
an
adventurous
take
on
the
quad
and
i
think
weyerbacher
hit
the
mark
however
to
rate
this
up
there
with
the
best
quads
in
the
world
would
be
a
sin
but
to
give
it
poor
marks
would
be
utter
blasphemy
this

and
an

i
went
back
and
forth
on
this
one
some
interesting
flavors
though
it
has
a
lot
of
heat
and
lacks
integration
impression
glad
i
got
to
try
blasphemy
should
have
named
it
why
bother
pours
a
very
cloudy
brown
color
with
little
to
no
head
or
lacing
and
flat
carbonation
very
heavily
particulate
caramel
nutty
hints
that
the
smell
that
is
also
very
boozey
taste
is
the
same
with
some
butterscotch
hints
alcohol
is
pretty
apparent
but
not
overwhelming
medium
body
with
slick
sticky
texture
slightly
bitter
in
the
finish
seems
like
this
brew
almost
has
too
many
flavors
that
i
cant
decypher
them
all
tkae
it
easy
with
this
brew
it
will
jump
up
and
bite
you
in
the
ass
the
beer
pours
a
clear
medium
brown
with
a
very
small
white
head
the
aroma
is
bourbon
oak
vanilla
and
cherry
the
flavor
is
bourbon
cherries
and
other
dark
fruit
alcohol
vanilla
oak
and
chocolate
this
is
one
boozy
quadrupel
low
carbonation
and
medium
mouthfeel
i
really
enjoyed
this
although
the
alcohol
could
be
toned
down
a
little
bit
in
order
to
make
it
more
drinkable
i
have
only
had
a
few
oak
aged
quadrupels
but
i
really
like
the
way
they
react
with
the
barrels
this
beer
is
no
exception
for
an
almost
12
abv
beer
t
is
amazingly
drinkable
this
is
a
beer
definitely
worth
seeking
out
once
my
papier
runs
out
what
a
sad
day
that
will
be
blasphemy
will
definitely
keep
me
going
hazy
orange
in
the
glass
with
an
off
white
head
which
quickly
disappears
huge
apple
aromas
along
with
some
bourbon
mulling
spices
and
a
bit
of
oak
vanilla
apple
bourbon
oak
brown
sugar
maybe
a
hint
of
cinnamon
and
some
nice
warming
alcohol
finishes
somewhat
dry
with
a
touch
of
bitterness
not
an
everyday
drinker
but
delicious
none
the
less
d
i
could
definitely
have
more
than
one
of
these
in
a
single
sitting
drinkability
its
definitely
drinkable
but
after
a
few
youll
more
then
likely
be
reeling
from
its
effects
the
fruity
tones
taste
great
but
for
people
who
are
more
attracted
to
scent
then
taste
this
may
be
a
one
and
done
deal
very
sweet
really
a
bit
too
much
for
me
the
booze
is
felt
rather
than
tasted
which
is
certainly
a
plus
for
such
a
big
beer
the
oak
aging
seems
to
smooth
out
some
of
the
edges
in
their
standard
quad
but
the
sweet
fruity
flavors
are
not
held
in
check
the
mouthfeel
is
full
and
lucious
with
the
usual
belgianesque
carbonation
the
sweetness
holds
back
on
the
drinkability
dthis
has
a
great
flavor
and
is
very
smooth
it
is
extremely
thick
and
the
alcohol
is
prevalent
great
beer
very
strong
d
the
weak
point
obviously
you
dont
drink
whisky
and
beer
at
the
same
rate
this
is
a
sipper
but
thats
what
it
should
be
savor
the
flavor
and
the
11

abv
bombardment
i
shared
this
with
a
friend
and
although
my
hangover
lackthereof
is
nice
note
i
felt
even
better
than
i
would
have
had
i
not
drank
anything
this
beer
is
one
you
could
really
enjoy
all
to
yourself
just
dont
move
mouthfeel
is
ok
ok
drinkability
check
that
5
sips
in
i
have
to
dump
it
not
good
drinkability
after
a
couple
of
years
of
aging
this
beer
has
probably
settled
down
but
it
hasnt
come
together
particularly
well
the
quad
elements
are
missing
and
the
alcohol
is
heavy
handed
drinkability
weyerbacher
blasphemy
is
a
slightly
above
average
beer
from
a
slightly
above
average
brewery
that
really
typifies
the
strengths
and
weaknesses
of
them
though
not
quite
as
bad
as
lagunitas
i
e
i
dont
expect
to
have
a
splitting
headache
tomorrow
morning
but
they
really
do
have
a
hard
time
covering
up
their
alcohol
its
spicy
hot
quasisolventy
and
really
hides
a
lot
of
what
i
imagine
are
really
nice
pleasant
wellintegrated
barrel
flavors
but
also
at
11
8
this
one
cant
be
too
terribly
drinkable
so
weyerbacher
work
on
this
youll
be
one
i
keep
coming
back
to
if
you
do
pours
a
clear
deep
orangeamber
with
a
bubbly

never
really

away
smell
is
sugary
sweet
with
lots
of
dark
fruits
cherries
and
plums
predominantly
a
bit
of
vanilla
and
rubbing
alcohol
the
alcohol
stings
the
nose
if
i
take
a
deep
breath
after
swirling
the
glass
a
bit
taste
is
sweet
with
cherries
prunes

some

harsh

i
dont
know
how
to
feel
about
this
one
it
is
hot
as
hell
there
is
no
hiding
of
the
alcohol
here
i
think
its
tasty
but
the
burn
is
a
bit
to
much
to
allow
me
to
enjoy
this
one
maybe
with
some
age
barrel
aging
is
very
evident
upon
tasting
as
is
the
alcohol
it
is
rummy
and
even
a
bit
like
whiskey
could
cellar
for
a
while
longer
for
sure
light
bodied
for
a
quad
and
drier
than
most
but
it
still
retains
some
sweetness
typical
of
the
style
there
is
a
nice
bready
yeasty
characteristic
but
not
quite
enough
to
me
it
almost
seems
like
a
tripel
and
a
half
as
it
needs
a
bit
more
bodyadding
malts
and
the
alcohol
is
a
bit
rough
but
that
is
being
a
bit
picky
i
am
very
glad
i
brought
this
out
for
my
500th
great
beer
and
i
am
sad
that
weyerbacher
has
discontinued
the
brew
mouthfeel
is
pretty
good
and
the
drinkability
isnt
too
bad
considering
how
big
this
beer
is
an
experience
beer
that
i
am
sad
is
apparently
retired
mouthfeel
is
medium
bodied
and
a
bit
slick
and
syrupy
mellow
carbonation
overall
its
a
bit
too
hot
and
sweet
for
me
personally
but
there
are
good
flavors
running
throughout
glad
i
got
to
try
it
but
i
enjoy
the
other
weyerbacher
barrel
aged
offerings
much
better
blasphemy
is
a
beer
that
big
beer
guys
will
long
debate
of
being
potentially
over
the
edge
if
you
like
weyerbacher
blithering
idiot
insanity
quad
or
merry
monks
this
beer
is
for
you
in
your
face
huge
in
flavor
and
big
in
abv
perfect
imo
i
have
3
6
packs
in
my
cellar
as
we
speak
and
i
look
forward
to
finnishing
them
all
bottle
pours
a
cloudy
orange
with
a
small
white
head
aroma
of
bourbon
and
sweet
malt
but
strongly
bourbon
flavor
of
candy
corn
sweet
malt
and
lots
of
bourbon
very
boozy
and
hard
to
get
through
ick
this
is
bad
not
reminiscent
in
any
way
of
an
abtquad

its
a
little
thick
in
chewy
in
the
mouth
and
with
all
that
alcohol
its
not
too
drinkable
ive
been
working
on
this
22
for
almost
2
hours
now
great
beer
i
absolutely
cant
wait
to
open
one
of
the
bottles
i
brought
home
delicious
beer
if
you
like
em
strong
drinkability
man
tough
d
really
boozy
but
very
drinkable
i
think
i
would
say
this
beat
out
the
quad
but
both
were
great
in
their
own
ways
too
bad
this
one
will
soon
no
longer
be
made
also
leaves
a
warm
feeling
in
your
belly
this
would
be
nice
on
a
cold
winter
night
this
beer
certainly
packs
a
punch
with
the
11
8
abv
but
i
was
hoping
for
more
from
the
mouthfeel
and
complexities
that
one
would
expect
from
the
style
and
oak
barrel
combo
the
balance
is
off
with
some
sips
and
enjoyable
with
others
i
love
this
beer
and
it
really
should
be
tried
by
any
strong
beer
fan
a
slightly
cloudy
dark
amber
color
with
a
fair
offwhite
head
and
lacing
the
aroma
brings
on
whiskey
and
nut
berry
and
oak
seems
potent
the
first
mouthful
is
fizzy
and
full
of
the
same
flavors
i
detected
in
the
aroma
as
advertized
this
suggests
oak
barrels
and
jack
daniels
still
not
quite
what
i
expected
highly
carbonated
and
lots
of
warming
alcohol
viscous
and
challenging
to
push
through
quickly
not
a
session
brew
for
me
these
flavors
arent
my
wheelhouse
somewhat
clove
in
the
belgian
tradition
conducive
to
food
to
help
cut
the
sharp
acidic
attack
of
this
aggressive
ale
there
is
a
nice
vanilla
caramel
hint
that
comes
out
as
it
warms
a
quality
brew
but
not
suited
to
the
average
consumer
definitely
worth
a
try
to
anyone
that
enjoys
a
strong
ale
and
possibly
a
big
winner
for
some
if
the
rumors
are
true
its
too
bad
that
weyerbacher
has
decided
to
give
blasphemy
the
axe
id
like
to
see
them
continue
to
tinker
with
both
quad
and
this
beer
in
an
effort
to
create
something
truly
special
it
wouldnt
take
much
besides
the
craft
beer
world
can
always
use
a
good
oakaged
quadrupel
pours
a
light
golden
color
with
a
reddish
tint
slight
head
on
the
pour
but
nothing
that
sticks
around
smell
is
alcohol
and
belgian
sugars
taste
is
wow
very
hot
this
thing
is
like
drinking
a
straight
shot
this
definitely
needs
some
time
to
calm
down
this
beer
will
absolutely
light
you
up
if
you
can
get
past
the
alcohol
there
is
a
nice
quad
underneath
there
but
god
help
you
if
you
can
find
it
full
and
complex
on
the
mouthfeel
this
is
a
beer
that
the
whole
time
youre
drinking
it
theres
no
mistaking
that
youre
going
to
be
fd
up
this
needs
to
be
put
down
and
cellared
for
a
very
long
time
d
so
great
loved
the
quad
and
love
this
even
more
this
beer
pours
a
hazy
reddish
orange
color
with
a
one
finger
head
that
lasts
several
minutes
mild
lacing
on
the
glass
throughout
nose
is
very
spicey
slightly
yeasty
with
some
sweetness
alcohol
is
definitely
detected
in
the
nose
taste
is
very
sweet
very
fruity
some
slight
notes
of
chocolate
in
the
taste
and
a
bit
of
yeast
the
alcohol
is
definitely
present
in
the
taste
as
well
combo
of
the
alcohol
and
sweetness
makes
this
one
a
sipper
for
me
the
more
it
warms
the
easier
it
goes
down
definitely
a
more
heavier
bodied
beer
overall
a
decent
beer
not
my
particular
style
and
if
youre
going
with
this
one
its
a
sipper
overall
this
is
a
very
complex
and
bold
beer
though
i
wish
would
have
shared
it
with
a
friend
notes
not
well
balanced
in
my
opinion
too
boozy
for
its
own
good
so
drinkability
is
not
bad
but
a
slow
sipper
i
felt
it
was
still
a
decent
brew
with
a
good
subtle
bourbon
taste
and
a
very
warming
effect
the
alcohol
just
needs
to
be
a
bit
masked
in
this
beer
and
then
i
think
it
will
garner
a
higher
grade
from
me
this
is
one
killer
beer
absolutely
topnotch
very
tasty
and
extremely
drinkable
almost
too
easy
to
drink
given
the
abv
like
a
previous
reviewer
noted
the
alcohol
is
present
but
never
hot
another
great
brew
from
weyerbacher
d
for
whatever
reason
blasphemy
is
a
very
drinkable
beer
considering
the
high
abv
although
the
abv
isnt
hidden
well
it
isnt
hot
which
helps
overall
i
wouldve
prefered
a
greater
depth
of
flavor
and
in
the
end
i
think
the
lack
of
body
is
what
really
holds
this
brew
back
as
is
the
case
with
most
of
weyerbachers
brews
a
good
beer
but
not
all
that
it
could
be
this
is
pretty
tasty
but
its
a
little
too
hot
to
trot
in
the
alcohol
department
i
like
bourbon
aged
beers
but
this
one
is
a
little
too
boozy
flavor
is
good
but
its
a
bit
rough
around
the
edges
definitely
a
sipper
i
actually
prefer
the
base
beer
quad
its
a
bit
more
drinkable
and
not
as
boozy
overall
a
mostly
sweet
slightly
sour
americanized
version
of
a
belgian
and
a
good
one
at
that
very
fruity
and
sweet
with
some
alcoholic
burn
behind
it
almost
like
a
very
sweet
barleywine
tastes
like
plum
fig
maybe
dark
cherry
all
the
awesome
dark
fruits
backed
by
sweet
malts
true
belgian
in
style
and
implementation
almost
like
a
belgian
dark
ale
except
lighter
in
body
but
a
lot
of
the
same
tastes
are
there
strong
full
mouthfeel
flavorful
and
coating
whilst
being
refreshing
at
the
same
time
drinkability
takes
a
bit
of
a
hit
because
of
the
booziness
but
thats
only
a
slight
hit
this
is
my
favorite
weyerbacher
so
far
definitely
worth
seeking
out
the
barrel
aging
leaves
its
mark
all
over
the
experience
without
being
totally
distinct
able
to
be
picked
out
highly
recommended
drinkability
is
pretty
good
this
beer
needs
a
little
more
depth
to
the
flavors
it
comes
off
a
little
too
strong
with
pretty
noticeable
alcohol
but
it
does
have
a
nice
mouthfeel
and
good
aromas
all
in
all
its
a
pretty
solid
quad
i
can
understand
why
weyerbacher
has
stopped
producing
this
as
i
can
see
a
very
limited
appeal
i
wouldnt
mind
keeping
a
few
bottles
of
this
around
for
special
occasions
in
the
end
i
found
the
bottle
of
quad
that
i
picked
up
right
next
to
this
one
on
the
shelf
to
be
a
much
more
harmonious
combination
of
flavors
and
significantly
more
drinkable
d
this
is
a
great
beer
to
sit
down
and
sip
at
and
i
could
probably
drink
2
at
best
over
an
hour
and
a
half
or
so
notes
from
jul
12
2008
di
dont
think
so
it
drinks
nicely
but
i
couldnt
do
more
than
one
at
a
sittingthis
is
a
sipping
beer
date
consumed
11
july
2008
this
is
a
tough
beer
to
get
through
because
of
the
alcoholic
heat
it
is
very
complex
and
really
needs
to
be
sipped
its
too
bad
the
booze
is
so
forefront
on
this
beer
everything
else
seems
to
be
in
check
and
right
where
it
needs
to
be
d
definitely
a
sipper
a
very
good
oak
aged
beer
ould
not
do
more
than
one
in
a
sitting
amber
color
white
head
and
decent
retention
oak
bourbon
vanilla
and
dark
fruits
in
the
nose
bourbon
oak
cherry
and
a
little
bit
of
vinous
character
in
the
taste
lighter
side
of
medium
bodied
and
light
carbonation
id
try
this
again
for
sure
d
this
is
a
special
treat
to
be
sipped
and
savored
like
a
fine
cognac
definately
not
a
session
beer
hats
off
to
weyerbacher
this
is
a
truly
spectacular
beer
more
breweries
need
to
experiment
with
bourbon
barrel
aged
belgian
style
beers
a
tasty
beverage
and
i
am
glad
that
ive
had
it
not
my
favorite
quad
but
still
rather
good
boring
review
but
who
really
cares
i
have
had
an
on
again
off
again
appreciation
of
weyerbacher
but
the
quad
and
its
off
shoot
blasphemy
is
definitely
a
unique
and
well
done
beer
on
their
end
i
would
lean
them
more
toward
belgian
barley
wines
than
quads
or
certainly
not
strong
dark
in
any
case
it
is
a
worthy
beer
to
experience
and
should
be
had
more
than
once
to
appreciate
its
complexity
and
character
and
it
sparks
my
interest
in
getting
a
regular
quad
which
i
have
not
had
in
a
long
time
very
heavy
and
full
flavored
beer
one
is
definitely
enough
a
slow
sipper
amazing
color
almost
a
red
ale
tint
and
minimal
head
with
no
rings
hits
the
back
of
the
tongue
and
stays
there
with
a
sweet
aftertaste
good
hop
level
with
medium
alcohol
noticed
would
not
be
long
night
repeat
drinker
as
the
alcohol
hits
quickly
mouthfeel
is
clean
and
lightly
citrusy
best
weyerbacher
i
have
had
pours
golden
amber
with
excellent
clarity
medium
head
minimal
lacing
nose
sweet
candi
sugar
booze
grapes
taste
medicinal
hotness
to
it
dark
fruits
plum
raisin
some
earthy
wood
and
of
course
bourbon
finishes
dry
and
hot
cabonation
is
moderate
body
not
all
that
thick
pours
a
medium
to
dark
amber
color
with
good
clarity
and
a
solid
half
inch
of
offwhite
head
aromas
of
deep
oak
notes
vanilla
spicy
esters
and
breadytoasty
malts
on
the
palate
the
oak
continues
to
really
soften
the
beer
while
providing
increased
complexity
to
an
already
interesting
belgian
it
finishes
thick
and
viscous
with
the
tannic
quality
of
the
wood
really
rounding
things
out
overall
i
think
this
is
one
of
the
better
oakaged
beers
from
weyerbacher
that
ive
tried
this
poured
a
hazy
burnt
auburn
with
a
bit
of
white
head
it
smelled
like
prunes
and
molasses
with
wild
yeast
and
honey
wheat
malt
and
a
bit
of
citrus
hops
it
tasted
like
honey
wheat
and
barley
malt
with
strong
orange
hops
and
a
hint
of
oakey
prunes
and
molasses
it
was
fairly
thick
with
lots
of
carbonation
and
had
a
bitter
aftertaste
with
alcohol
warming
overall
this
had
a
clean
bold
flavor
that
was
surprisingly
bright
it
had
noticeable
alcohol
and
a
lasting
aftertaste
which
made
more
of
a
sipping
beer
although
still
quite
enjoyable
it
didnt
have
as
much
oak
in
the
flavor
as
i
expected
id
like
to
try
this
one
again
after
its
been
aged
a
few
years
the
beer
was
great
not
as
good
as
i
had
hoped
but
better
than
average
i
was
especting
a
bit
more
of
the
oak
flavor
but
it
mostly
just
tasted
like
a
barley
wine
i
love
barley
wine
and
it
fit
that
well
im
just
expected
a
bit
more
i
would
buy
and
drink
this
again
and
i
have
had
a
lot
of
weyerbacher
beer
before
its
just
not
exceptional
fullbodied
sticky
lightlycarbonated
and
slick
superb
and
substantial
feel
drinkability
severely
limited
by
a
smokingbig
abv
the
copious
booze
in
this
brew
makes
itself
a
presence
in
the
flavor
and
feel
of
the
drink
and
in
the
functionality
of
the
drinker
22
oz
bomber
into
tulip
glass
picked
this
up
really
randomly
ive
had
a
lot
of
the
weyerbacher
offerings
but
ive
never
had
thisor
the
nonoak
aged
version
of
the
quad
pours
a
reddish
mahogany
somewhat
cloudy
very
good
amount
of
head
after
a
couple
minutes
it
goes
down
but
retains
to
a
caked
on
layer
lots
of
lacing
really
beautiful
looking
beer
actually
smell
is
dominated
by
oak
and
a
lot
of
spiceim
even
getting
nutmeg
and
cinnamon
in
there
vaguely
like
a
winter
warmer
some
citrus
notes
in
there
as
well
alcohol
present
taste
is
really
surprising
kind
of
aggressive
on
the
sour
cherry
side
actually
especially
for
a
quad
alcohol
is
very
noticeable
i
have
to
admit
its
good
but
its
quite
a
lot
to
handle
the
usual
chorus
members
show
up
in
the
taste
as
well
vanilla
oak
brown
sugar
etc
very
thick
body
moderate
to
high
carbonation
definitely
good
but
as
the
label
admits
its
kind
of
a
strange
idea
for
a
beer
would
have
come
together
better
if
the
alcohol
wasnt
so
present
it
started
with
a
nice
foamy
finger
of
mediumtan
head
but
the
retention
was
so
marginal
that
when
i
looked
back
it
had
dissipated
into
wisps
the
color
had
a
slight
haze
but
it
was
definitely
a
deepamber
with
reddish
highlights
the
nose
was
very
oaky
with
lots
of
vanilla
caramel
and
coconut
evident
the
mouthfeel
besides
being
mediumtofull
was
really
hot
this
beer
seems
to
cry
out
to
be
aged
this
is
what
i
have
deemed
a
now
n
later
beer
after
the
childrens
candy
that
advised
have
some
now
and
save
some
for
later
i
might
have
to
see
about
procuring
another
bottle
for
cellaring
purposes
after
the
initial
heat
died
down
i
tasted
a
lot
of
dried
fruit
raisins
prunes
even
banana
along
with
the
sweet
caramel
and
vanilla
that
i
noted
on
the
nose
the
finish
was
still
really
sweet
and
coupled
with
its
high
abv
one
was
plenty
on
this
goround
if
i
can
score
another
it
will
go
in
the
basement
to
await
its
time
drinks
great
you
do
feel
the
heft
but
a
damn
fine
quad
worth
trying
unlike
anything
i
had
previously
encountered
note
if
the
extreme
moonshine
characteristics
are
bothersome
like
they
are
to
me
this
beer
vastly
improves
if
its
let
to
air
out
in
the
glass
for
a
few
hours
even
though
it
lowers
the
carbonation
significantly
treating
it
as
a
red
wine
softened
the
overall
profile
and
made
it
more
enjoyable
let
it
open
up
decant
it
if
you
will
then
park
it
in
the
fridge
and
chill
it
down
to
60
degrees
or
so
think
grapes
drinkability
interesting
brew
and
nice
but
the
oak
was
a
bit
much
for
me
even
though
i
love
oaked
beers
its
a
transparent
amberorange
colored
brew
with
a
white
fluffy
head
that
almost
completely
disappears
and
left
very
minimul
lacing
it
smells
strongly
of
rubing
alcohol
but
also
has
a
wiskeyoak
smell
some
malt
hint
of
fruity
esters
and
a
very
nice
vanilla
smell
overall
the
taste
is
dominated
by
an
acidic
chemicalsolvent
type
of
flavor
its
unfortunate
because
there
are
some
nice
flavores
there
that
get
pretty
blown
away
like
vanilla
oak
and
some
slight
apple
cider
the
mouth
feel
was
very
nice
however
i
really
struggled
to
drink
the
whole
bottle
22oz
bomber
poured
into
a
couple
of
snifters
has
a
light
amber
color
and
a
white
foamy
head
with
good
retention
and
some
lace
aroma
of
bourbon
vanilla
maple
and
a
hint
of
oak
smell
is
quite
pleasant
tastes
to
match
with
a
heavy
booze
flavor
and
finishes
cloyingly
sweet
mouthfeel
is
very
heavy
tough
to
drink
this
one
it
might
benefit
from
some
aging
this
doesnt
taste
like
an
oak
aged
quadruple
it
just
tastes
like
whiskey
and
oak
its
disappointing
that
something
which
should
have
complex
flavor
profiles
has
been
reduced
to
what
it
is
i
really
cant
recommend
this
if
anything
try
the
original
quadruple
d
great
oak
character
compliment
and
adds
to
their
already
very
good
quad
beer
very
much
worth
a
try
a
great
sipping
quad
that
lives
up
to
is
name
the
next
morning
if
you
drink
to
many
of
these
the
night
before
d
an
exceptional
brew
for
the
wine
lover
in
you
though
as
a
belgian
its
only
good
d
to
be
sipped
slowly
a
boozy
sipper
here
the
bourbon
didnt
really
make
that
great
of
an
impression
on
me
relatively
speaking
the
quad
aspect
was
fine
though
didnt
really
nail
the
style
a
bit
of
an
awkward
combo
here
not
as
impressed
with
this
one
as
with
the
other
two
of
the
series
ive
had
still
in
all
its
a
fair
enough
attempt
and
certainly
worth
trying
it
was
okay
i
had
no
desire
to
have
another
one
and
i
doubt
i
would
seek
this
one
out
or
recommend
it
to
anyone
i
wouldnt
steer
anyone
away
from
this
but
nor
would
i
talk
it
up
served
in
my
chimay
goblet
and
poured
from
a
bomber
bottle
this
11
8
brew
pours
bourbon
in
color
with
a
brandy
tint
no
head
and
zero
carbonation
the
nose
was
mild
but
vanilla
notes
were
there
but
little
else
the
taste
spoke
of
caramelbourbon
notes
vanilla
and
slightly
sugary
mouthfeel
was
boozy
and
quite
warming
in
the
finish
this
is
very
much
a
creeper
as
to
alcohol
as
it
hides
from
the
taste
but
also
a
pleasant
brew
a
quad
yes
deceptive
though
it
may
be
since
its
about
an
inch
away
from
a
barleywine
too
nice
effort
from
weyerbacher
even
more
bourbon
in
the
flavor
and
while
its
hard
to
cut
through
the
booziness
some
of
the
raisin
and
fruity
esters
present
themselves
on
the
sides
of
the
tongue
although
only
6
higher
in
abv
than
the
quad
this
is
a
whole
different
ballgame
due
to
the
sharpness
of
the
alcohol
make
sure
youre
not
going
anywhere
for
a
while
this
is
one
of
few
beers
i
would
recommend
sharing
your
bomber
with
a
friend
acidic
on
the
throat
and
heavy
in
the
stomach
its
not
something
youll
probably
need
or
want
seconds
of
that
said
im
always
a
fan
of
extremes
and
this
one
certainly
fits
the
bill
this
is
definitely
a
sipper
beer
poured
dark
amber
with
a
nice
sized
head
aroma
of
bourbon
abounds
and
gets
stronger
as
the
beer
gets
to
room
temp
cant
gulp
this
one
too
stong
could
be
a
dessert
sipper
i
plan
on
getting
to
weyerbacher
to
taste
this
baby
out
of
the
tap
for
sure
the
beer
poured
a
clear
dark
amber
with
a
thick
almond
head
into
a
pint
glass
the
aroma
was
of
bourbon
and
candy
sugar
the
initial
taste
was
of
sweet
maltcandy
sugar
immediately
smothered
by
an
enormous
bourboninfused
alcoholic
component
no
attempt
to
mask
the
11
8
abv
definitely
a
sipping
beer
and
would
benefit
from
a
larger
malt
presence
to
counteract
the
alcoholic
esters
d
definitely
a
sipper
i
could
see
aging
this
one
would
help
mellow
out
the
alcohol
heat
t
full
body
very
thick
and
smooth
on
the
tongue
with
a
light
but
active
carbonation
after
aging
for
a
year
the
alcohol
is
much
more
tolerable
in
this
but
still
very
present
sweeter
than
most
other
quads
very
strong
honey
sweet
spice
presence
as
other
reviews
have
said
this
is
a
different
beer
than
quad
not
just
an
oak
aged
version
the
oak
aging
adds
a
rum
like
alcohol
presence
to
quad
im
usually
quick
to
fault
weyerbacher
beers
for
having
a
samey
boozy
house
yeast
taste
but
after
aging
this
for
a
year
it
rises
above
that
stereotype
for
me
i
still
prefer
quad
to
this
but
i
highly
recommend
trying
this
beer
for
a
different
take
on
this
style
but
if
you
find
a
bottle
you
should
probably
let
this
sit
for
awhile
aging
this
longer
would
mask
the
alcohol
perception
but
increase
the
sweetness
i
havent
enjoyed
beers
aged
for
long
periods
of
time
because
of
the
sweetness
so
ultimately
i
like
aging
rich
belgians
and
english
barleywines
to
a
good
medium
where
the
alcohol
meshes
well
with
the
sweetness
this
beer
fits
that
equation
will
definitely
enjoy
again
d
a
big
sweet
sipper
that
has
a
nice
slight
barrel
quality
this
isnt
quite
as
drinkable
as
its
cousin
insanity
its
definitely
a
sipper
best
suited
to
cold
weather
maybe
hovering
over
a
grill
in
the
cold
new
england
winter
months
still
this
is
great
stuff
for
some
reason
previous
weyerbacher
offerings
havent
blown
my
doors
off
but
insanity
and
blasphemy
are
definitely
bringin
it
d
this
is
a
nice
quad
that
requires
much
cellaring
to
allow
it
to
blend
better
way
too
much
cherry
and
hot
alcohol
here
ive
had
big
beers
like
this
that
hide
the
alcohol
much
better
two
fingers
of
very
active
deep
tan
bubbley
head
finely
calms
to
about
a
half
an
inch
it
sits
attractive
in
the
glass
with
a
ruby
amber
glow
nose
is
wonderfully
syrupy
sweet
with
great
complexity
showcases
notes
of
vanilla
taffy
honey
soft
spicey
slchol
and
banana
there
is
a
hint
of
woodsy
oak
tword
the
end
of
the
nose
on
first
sip
you
get
a
loud
mixture
of
sharp
spice
fronted
alchol
and
a
peppery
biscuity
richness
sweet
tones
are
of
buttery
dark
fruit
alchol
is
very
present
throughout
the
palate
and
hop
in
the
belly
there
is
a
dry
bitterness
on
the
finish
that
i
actually
pick
up
a
bit
of
coconut
rum
mouthfeel
is
of
thick
bitter
spice
with
these
facts
it
is
as
drinkable
as
it
could
be
being
this
big
and
hot
very
warming
and
alcoholic
and
somewhat
boozy
this
was
a
huge
and
extreme
beer
i
enjoyed
it
but
as
far
as
bas
go
i
expected
more
this
is
certainly
one
that
should
be
shared
i
shared
this
one
with
my
dad
and
he
liked
it
as
well
i
would
probably
have
this
on
again
in
the
future
of
all
the
beer
i
bought
on
my
last
run
to
vintage
cellar
this
is
the
only
one
the
guy
at
the
counter
opinionated
on
and
he
endorsed
it
highly
i
like
it
too
i
prefer
the
more
playful
and
colorful
quad
over
its
barrelaged
cousin
but
this
is
no
slouch
pick
it
up
if
you
see
it
pours
rather
dark
red
with
a
short
white
head
a
bit
of
lacing
nose
is
at
first
rather
strong
with
alcohols
but
what
do
you
expect
from
a
nearly
12
abv
beer
taste
is
also
a
bit
strong
with
some
funkiness
semisweet
heavy
fruits
but
overall
pretty
good
the
funk
takes
over
a
bit
but
isnt
100
overwhelming
considering
the
high
octane
of
the
brew
it
is
rather
drinkable
and
pretty
good
hazy
caramel
orange
colour
with
a
thin
layer
of
fine
beige
bubbles
solid
collar
with
a
bit
of
spotty
lacing
fruity
aroma
some
banana
coconut
flesh
oak
mild
vanilla
and
a
bit
of
caramel
same
in
the
flavour
but
with
additional
oak
and
sweetness
its
also
got
an
earthy
and
bready
character
plus
alcohol
towards
the
end
and
a
lot
of
heat
in
the
finish
the
sweetness
really
seems
to
be
reigning
in
the
alcohol
here
and
its
needed
the
body
is
definitely
on
the
full
side
with
plenty
of
carbonation
and
a
fair
bit
of
dryness
lots
of
warmth
that
stuns
the
tongue
too
this
one
really
seems
like
a
car
wreck
but
somehow
it
hangs
together
im
not
sure
how
weyerbacher
pulls
that
off
in
some
of
these
big
beers
but
the
result
is
pretty
good
here
one
of
the
better
weyerbacher
beers
that
i
have
had
i
get
the
sense
that
the
base
beer
here
a
quad
would
not
be
as
complex
or
tasty
as
i
would
want
from
the
style
but
the
addition
of
the
oak
adds
an
extra
dimension
that
really
helps
to
make
this
beer
work
poured

into

was

gone
the
beer
is
a
deep

of
malt
plums
and
vanilla

of
malt

the
alcohol
is
warming
mouthfeel
is

and
light
i
poured
a
12
oz
bottle
into
a
crystal
snifter
it
had
a
creamy
head
that
left
little
lacing
the
color
was
a
deep
red
almost
opaque
with
a
rim
of
white
foam
around
the
inside
of
the
glass
the
smell
again
as
with
the
ommegang
abby
ale
was
of
dried
fruits
dates
and
figs
the
taste
was
smooth
with
fruity
sweet
and
chocolate
malty
notes
this
is
an
awesome
beer
i
love
how
weyerbacher
will
take
one
beer
age
it
in
oak
and
then
release
it
as
an
entirely
different
beer
it
is
amazing
how
a
little
bit
of
wood
can
make
such
a
difference
in
the
taste
and
complexity
of
a
beer
drinkability
maybe
a
few
years
in
the
cellar
would
help
blasphemy
come
together
better
but
as
it
stands
id
rather
just
stick
with
the
quad
even
the
dude
on
the
label
is
struggling
to
keep
it
down
taste
is
malty
diacetyl
being
present
so
its
quite
buttery
vanilla
is
intrusive
a
very
warming
beer
as
the
alcohol
is
pretty
evident
as
the
oaked
aspects
mellows
the
sweetness
there
was
a
lot
of
bourbon
in
the
nose
but
the
flavor
was
more
plain
or
red
wine
oak
iwould
like
to
know
what
they
used
great
beer
d
this
beer
has
a
nice
blend
of
beer
and
barrel
but
they
both
bring
their
fusel
flavors
to
the
party
surprisingly
it
didnt
bother
me
and
started
to
balance
with
the
sweetness
drinkability
i
was
really
under
the
impression
that
for
a
beer
to
be
a
quad
it
had
to
be
aged
in
an
oak
barrel
anyway
but
in
this
case
it
has
been
aged
too
long
in
an
american
oak
barrel
this
severely
detracts
from
the
light
drinkability
of
the
beer
and
makes
me
want
to
run
for
the
hills
that
said
i
will
age
my
other
bottle
back
and
see
what
this
does
in
a
few
years
this
one
i
have
been
wanting
to
try
for
quite
a
while
now
the
idea
of
a
quad
aged
in
barrels
definitely
seems
like
something
to
get
excited
about

decent
amber
color

lively

heavy
and
boozy
although
this
is
a
very
decent
beer
it
tastes
a
lot
more
like
a
barleywine
than
a
quad
the
price
tag
is
also
a
bit
of
a
setback
worth
a
try
i
guess
but
i
would
go
with
teh
insanity
before
this
one

another

overall
weyerbacher
usually
does
a
fantastic
job
with
the
barrel
aging
and
this
was
proof
of
that
a
very
big
quad
that
beared
its
teeth
and
took
a
bite
but
wasnt
as
big
as
it
could
have
been
very
nice
flavors
and
very
robust
i
would
love
to
try
this
one
again
some
day
very
nice
d
this
a
fantastic
treat
to
sip
and
savor
every
now
and
then
in
a
tasting
of
about
20
beers
its
a
bit
weird
that
one
of
the
ones
i
brought
was
my
favourite
of
the
night
but
well
there
you
go
in
my
notes
it
reads
and
i
quote
holy
crap
oak
so
you
get
where
im
going
with
this
in

to
blowyourheadoff
oak
aromas
and
flavours
there
are
some
quite
complex
undertones
of
butter
vanilla

which
make
this
more
drinkable
than
some
of
its
oakaged
brethren
pretty
tough
to
hide

they
do
a
decent
job
of
trying
probably
one
of
my
favourite
weyerbacher
big
beers
so
far
i
am
a
little
disappointed
that
the
aroma
doesnt
reflect
the
complexity
i
get
with

lot
of
cherry
scents
first
sip
reveals
a
slightly
syrupy
texture
with
fine
rolling
gentle
carbonation
flavor
is
complex
with
mostly
sweet
malt
notes
mixing
nicely
i
get
caramel
and
bourbon
with
dark
fruit
again
i
think
cherries
are
in
the
flavor
too
not
as
boozy
on
flavor
as
nose
advertised
fairly
easy
to
drink
and
nicely
done
bottle
poured
into
a
snifter
aromas
of
deep
malts
fresh
wood
flooring
i
just
redid
my
house
some
vanilla
sweetness
and
that
aroma
you
get
from
a
banana
minus
the
sweet
banana
flavor
but
that
tartness
you
get
from
a
green
banana
the
green
banana
flavor
comes
out
even
more
in
the
flavor
along
with
the
super
sweet
plumlike
malt
the
mouth
feel
is
really
sweet
and
almost
cloying
fullbodied
that
finishes
with
a
slight
dryness
and
a
little
bitter
overall
the
oak
barrel
phenomenon
is
over
taking
beers
there
is
a
little
too
much
oak
cloyingness
to
make
this
a
really
drinkable
beer
would
go
great
with
a
caramel
apple
tart
i
might
be
able
to
have
one
of
these
at
a
time
but
there
are
many
better
options
in
my
opinion
for
that
type
of
usage
average
beer
that
i
am
not
sure
the
oak
really
helps
at
all
whoa
this
is
a
big
beer
astringent
alcohol
flavor
pair
with
again
acidrich
oak
sour
apple
cherry
mouthfeel
is
mediumbodied
dry
and
bitter
all
the
way
its
a
bit
like
swallowing
nail
polish
wood
stainer
or
some
other
dangerous
substance
its
quite
difficult
to
put
this
one
away
which
is
strange
because
ive
not
had
trouble
with
other
high
abv
beers

this
one
just
has
too
much
acidity
and
bite
behind
its
oaken
bark
it
would
be
interesting
to
see
how
this
brew
matures
as
it
might
mellow
out
some
of
the
more
pungent
aromatics
and
flavors
d
not
the
easiest
to
drink
a
slow
sipper
for
sure
and
the
alcohol
definitely
lets
you

its

glad
to
have
had
a
chance
to
try
it
drinkability
loved
it
that
simple
im
going
to
have
to
try
the
nonbarreled
version
as
well
but
this
brew
will
definetly
open
me
up
to
more
quads
the
guys
at
weyerbacher
have
another
big
brew
winner
and
this
bourbon
barrel
aging
is
something
im
definetly
going
to
have
to
investigate
as
theres
an
ris
and
barleywine
version
yes
im
jacked
drinking
it
young
reveals
a
ton
of
character
flaws
that
will
definitely
round
out
given
the
proper
time
and
storage
but
once
a
beer
hits
the
shelves
it
should
be
ready
to
drink
imho
i
think
i
may
buy
just
one
more
bottle
and
sit
on
it
for
three
years
and
try
again
if
it
rounds
out
the
way
i
think
it
may
it
will
be
well
worth
the
wait
even
up
to
the
tune
of
a
full
point
gain
or
more
in
every
rating
category
fingers
crossed
d
very
strong
and
flavorful
the
mouthfeel
is
less
than
ideal
hard
to
drink
a
lot
of
it
thin
and
filmy
does
not
finish
clean
one
bit
again
this
is
a
quadrupel
if
so
if
fails
to
impress
nice
mouthfeel
and
surprisingly
drinkable
i
should
have
saved
this
bottle
until
january
or
february
drinkability
i
wouldnt
do
more
than
two
of
these
in
one
sitting
unless
i
had
nothing
else
to
do
in
the
morning
quad
was
one
of
my
favorite
beers
from
weyerbacher
but
i
think
this
one
is
better
you
need
to
be
a
fan
of
nice
liqours
to
appreciate
this
beer
it
is
close
in
flavor
profile
to
some
of
the
finer
rums
ive
had
the
privilege
of
experiencing
in
my
life
the
sweetness
of
the
barley
with
the
bourbon
risiduals
is
tantalizing
and
should
age
with
grace
other
reviews
of
this
beer
view
it
as
a
last
ditch
effort
to
put
another
big
beer
in
bourbon
barrels
which
is
probably
true
but
this
one
is
successful
in
the
end
i
for
one
give
big
thanks
to
a
brewery
who
puts
the
effort
into
barrel
aging
while
keeping
their
prices
at
an
affordable
level
and
producing
a
very
complex
product
few
could
replicate
this
complexity
with
a
wine
or
other
beer
that
is
comparable
in
price
good
job
weyerbacher
another
big
beer
winner
from
weyerbacher
though
the
final
couple
of
bottles
are
heading
to
the
cellar
for
awhile
to
try
and
take
a
little
edge
off
the
alcohol
worth
trying
overall
a
bit
coarse
and
would
probably
do
well
with
a
few
years
of
aging
but
good
stuff
and
worth
looking
for
this
was
not
very
drinkable
its
super
high
abv
tastes
super
strong
and
generally
not
very
good
id
wager
9991000
average
beer
drinkers
would
take
one
sip
of
this
and
say
it
sucks
fans
of
quads
big
beers
and
weyerbacher
may
be
more
forgiving
but
its
probably
just
the
alcohol
clouding
their
judgment
after
they
power
through
a
bottle
of
this
beast
ive
actually
got
another
bottle
of
this
in
the
cellar
from
a
trip
to
ny
earlier
this
summer
that
im
now
certainly
in
no
hurry
to
break
into
well
see
how
a
few
years
treat
this
right
now
its
pretty
rough
like
drinking
like
a
sweetweak
brandy
22
oz
at
a
time
i
honestly
doubt
it
will
really
improve
that
drastically
but
ill
surely
forget
or
maybe
never
forget
about
this
one
long
enough
that
who
knows
d
overall
i
reveled
in
this
belgian
interpretation
with
a
twist
from
weyerbacher
the
oak
aging
was
nice
and
added
an
unexpected
quality
making
for
a
unique
quaff
while
it
may
not
have
surpassed
its
ancestors
its
still
a
worthy
offering
and
worth
a
try
d
this
is
not
what
ive
come
to
expect
from
a
barrel
aged
beer
but
i
suppose
i
havent
had
to
many
it
was
delicious
however
the
strong
malt
flavor
of
quads
ive
had
did
not
rear
its
head
in
this
beer
but
instead
took
a
back
seat
to
fruitiness
and
whiskey
not
at
all
for
sessioning
this
beer
is
instead
one
to
sip
and
calm
the
nerves
when
relaxation
is
required
what
i
generally
reserve
whiskey
rather
than
beer
for
im
happy
to
have
chosen
this
one
for
my
100th
review
and
will
be
happy
to
enjoy
it
again
this
beer
pours
a
dark
brown
color
with
a
tall
head
that
doesnt
have
great
retention
but
leaves
a
little
lacing
on
the
glass
the
aroma
has
a
lot
of
alcohol
as
well
as
a
lot
of
fruit
and
some
spices
the
flavors
are
very
complex
and
alcoholic
lots
of
alcohol
and
lots
of
sweet
dark
fruit
combine
with
some
oak
and
finishes
with
a
nice
hop
bitterness
the
body
is
medium
and
the
drinkability
is
pretty
good
for
the
apparent
alcohols
tasty
i
didnt
care
much
for
the
quad
but
the
oak
aging
does
add
some
complexity
if
this
were
available
in
a
smaller
bottle
i
might
try
it
again
pours
a
clean
deep
amber
with
an
off
white
head
aromas
that
are
oaky
and
a
small
presence
of
a
dark
fruit
in
the
taste
an
oaky
plum
alcohol
yet
very
minimal
a
small
alcoholic
burn
and
a
alcoholic
aftertaste
small
oaky
flavor
left
behind
as
well
big
taste
but
it
is
smooth
great
sipping
beer
d
one
is
plenty
at
this
abv
but
well
done
and
thoroughly
enjoyable
d
this
is
a
sipping
beer
any
more
than
that
and
youll
be
on
your
arse
before
you
realize
it
one
tops
its
quite
laborious
toward
the
end
but
definitely
a
labor
of
love
whoa
put
this
one
back
it
aint
ready
yet
im
not
saying
its
a
bad
beer
but
it
feels
like
it
needs
some
time
the
nose
has
some
great
vanilla
and
oak
notes
but
theyre
overwhelmed
by
alcohol
there
and
in
the
flavor
theres
a
background
sweetness
in
the
taste
but
again
the
booze
prevails
i
recommend
this
beer
because
it
seems
like
theres
some
great
stuff
going
on
but
let
it
sit
for
at
least
6
months
before
consuming
da
this
amazing
belgian
style
takes
on
a
new
depth
with
its
oakaged
effect
leave
it
up
to
an
american
brewery
to
enhance
such
a
beloved
style
the
name
is
appropriate
for
this
reason

is
felt
rather
fast
and
eventhough
its
highly
enjoyable
i
was
seriously
buzzed
after
this
bomber
so
the
key
is
too
enjoy
slowly
i
have
a
feeling
this
stuff
will
be
killer
with
some
cellaring
this
is
a
nightcapper
this
put
me
right
in
the
mood
to
toss
on
a
game
and
hit
the
sack
maybe
thats
why
this
review
is
a
little
shorter
gnite
this
offering
pours
a
maroon
clear
body
leaving
a
thin

that
disappears

the
taste
starts

the
finish
is
bitter
more
than
expected
with
a
faint
bourbon
oaky

feel
this
is
a
darn
smooth
quad
one
that
is
made
for
sipping
d
the
abv
is
huge
and
accentuated
by
the
heat
from
the
bourbon
this
is
a
nightcap
i
suspect
that
ill
sleep
soundly
tonight
oelergud
this
is
a
onesided
beer
if
you
like
that
side
youll
love
this
beer
its
contrary
to
my
preferences
and
thus
the
relatively
light
review
if
you
like
megamalty
powerfully
alcoholic
beers
this
may
be
perfect
for
you

the

is
so
outwardly
sugary
not
sure
if
this
is
a
good
thing
flavors
come
crashing
in
with
alcohol
not
hidden
at
all
im
going
to
age
a
bottle
of
this
bruiser
to
see
if
it
mellows
my
nose
hair
is
past
the
tickling
point
its
definitely
burning
high
alcohol
and
syurpy
sweetness
overrides
alot
of
flavor
aspects
of
this
beer
although
its
nice
to
have
a
quad
aged
on
oak
the
charred
wood
vanilla
and
whiskey
notes
all
come
to
play
but
hide
the
parts
of
the
beer
that
were
once
really
desireable
man
its
so
boozy
i
dont
feel
like
im
drinking
beer
anymore
this
is
definitely
blasphemy
mouthfeel
is
sticky
with
residual
sugars
alcohol
sizzles
on
the
palate
with
each
sip
really
begins
to
become
cloying
when
it
warms
up
a
bit
carbonation
is
ample
but
the
barrel
aging
is
definitely
evident
drinkability
im
just
such
a
fan
the
standard
quad
and
the
alright
tripel
they
brew
why
throw
them
in
oak
barrels
i
dont
think
its
helps
these
styles
on
the
other
hand
im
in
love
with
both
hersey
and
insanity
amazing
and
this
seems
much
different
in
color
than
the
standard
quad
i
remember
drinking
d
i
like
this
a
lot
its
a
very
creamy
beer
with
very
complex
taste
and
smell
try
it
if
you
can
i
want
more
i
was
expecting
more
in
the
way
of
wood
in
this
beer
but
overall
very
nice
ive
never
really
been
overly
impressed
by
weyerbacher
but
this
is
really
good
although
the
alcohol
is
seriously
strong
i
dont
know
what
it
is
ive
had
bottles
of
wine
and
other
big
beers
that
dont
seem
to
hit
as
hard
as
this
weird

the

makes
it
simply

intense
even
for
an

i

itd
be
good
if
you
lay
it
down
for
a

right
now
dnot
very
drinkable
the
alcohol

overwhelming
to
me
i
have
had
many
brews
in
the
1012
that
did
not
overwhelm
like
this
the
biggest
difference
between
blasphemy
and
quad
is
the
strong
vanilla
tones
and
young
alcohol
presence
blasphemy

light

a
slightly
foamy

and
then
it
all
closes
up
nicely
with

heavy
on
the

mouthfeel

this

hits
you
first
with
a
huge
smack
of
alcohol
that
really
burns
as
it
goes
down
spicy
and
fruity
with
sweet
malt
tones
but
its
all
overwhelmed
to
some
extent
by
the
alcohol
makes
my
saliva
glands
open
like
a
scotch
will
thick
and
full
bodied
almost
even
syrupy
overall
a
bit
too
much
for
me
in
terms
of
the
alcohol
and
not
enough
flavor
i
think
its
light
and
sticky
sweet
im
glad
i
picked
this
one
up
ill
have
to
grab
another
to
age

i
found
this

very
syrupy

all
in
allthis
is
a
very
good
beer
from
a
brewery
that
i
always
seem
to
enjoy
great
sipping
beer
an
awesome
example
of
an
oak
aged
beer
and
one
thats
better
than
the
original
unoaked
version
i
think
this
might
be
a
little
much
for
the
uninitiated
craft
drinker
and
should
be
saved
for
special
in
the
know
people
what
can
i
say
about
this
beer
that
would
serve
it
justice
by
all
means
it
is
not
perfection
but
if
perfection
were
a
destination
blasphemy
would
be
a
stop
very
near
the
end
of
your
journey
the
first
couple
of
sips
were
a
little
overwhelming
afterwards
however
the
ride
is
smooth
sailing
the
vanilla
tones
are
very
pronounced
which
is
a
good
thing
in
my
opinion
i
am
also
a
bourbon
drinker
when
it
comes
to
the
harder
variety
of
alcoholic
beverages
the
bourbon
barrel
aging
process
makes
drinking
this
beer
akin
to
going
home
and
enjoying
a
nice
glass
of
lemonade
on
the
porch
with
grandma
i
have
nothing
negative
to
say
about
this
brew
so
drink
up
and
enjoy
the
beer
pours
an
amber
color
with
a
thick
frothy
offwhite
head
that
slowly
fades
to
lacing
the
aroma
is
good
it
has
a
nice
pale
and
light
crystal
malt
scent
along
with
a
belgian
yeast
fruitiness
as
well
as
an
oakeyvanilla
aroma
the
taste
is
good
also
it
has
a
warm
malty
flavor
thats
rich
in
crystal
malts
and
oak
esters
it
goes
down
smooth
with
firm
oak
finish
it
blends
well
with
the
barrels
but
not
as
well
as
the
heresy
and
prophesy
beers
the
mouthfeel
is
fine
it
is
a
full
bodied
beer
with
adequate
carbonation
this
is
a
good
drinking
beer
i
love
the
oak
aged
series
it
adds
a
whole
other
element
to
the
beer
body
is
big
but
retains
a
bit
of
delicate
belgian
characteristic
slick
and
thick
it
is
a
sipper
for
sure
i
dont
recommend
tackling
aa
22
oz
bottle
without
a
little
help
mmmmm
quite
delicious
but
with
slightly
too
much
alcohol
in
the
mouth
and
chest
again
oak
is
very
toasty
and
vanillafied
tastes
of
new
american
variety
and
again
fig
and
nutty
flavors
at
the
forefront
with
the
same
red
currant
and
bing
cherry
nice
and
spicey
with
a
light
carbonation
that
makes
this
a
bit
creamy
and
lively
on
the
palate
i
really
like
the
mouthfeel
and
nothing
is
overpowering
which
really
helps
drinkability
definitely
a
sipper
but
a
sipper
you
can
sip
for
a
day
in
other
words
nicely
integrated
with
modest
complexity
poured
a
deep
amber
with
a
decent
head
that
diminished
rather
slowly
to
nothing
the
aroma
was
of
dark
malts
dried
fruits
and
some
subdued
hops
the
taste
was
extremely
complex
dried
fruit
dancing
nicely
with
a
subtle
oak
flavor
the
beer
was
heavy
but
not
overbearing
excellent
alcohol
warmth
this
was
a
unique
enjoyable
beer
pours
a
dark
amber
with
relatively
little
depth
head
is
a
slight
dusting
on
top
of
the
liquid
many
constant
upward
streams
of
bubbles
keep
things
fresh
the
nose
is
oak
all
the
way
vanilla
fudge
bananas
treacle
and
a
drytoasted
woodiness
dominate
the
wood
treatment
has
covered
up
some
of
the
solvent
alcohol
that
plagued
the
weyerbacher
quad
on
the
palate
its
very
sweet
its
dying
for
some
rich
creamy
cheese
as
a
pairing
with
a
powerful
vanilla
flavor
and
some
banana
notes
the
alcohol
while
masked
in
the
nose
comes
out
in
force
on
the
palate
providing
a
big
burn
considering
the
very
active
carbonation
theres
relatively
little
in
the
mouthfeel
this
is
a
big
sweet
beer
best
suited
for
dessert
its
decent
but
not
revelatory
beautiful
deep
amber
color
with
a
slight
white
hat
of
small
bubbles
the
nose
is
sugary
with
some
smokiness
and
an
oak
earthy
presence
the
taste
is
sublime
the
quad
lifts
the
tongue
in
joy
and
the
woody
oak
which
is
perfectly
tuned
here
hits
the
tongue
in
a
long
aftertaste
the
body
belies
the
gravity
of
the
beer
a
sipper
for
certain
as
the
whole
bottle
with
have
you
singing
songs
you
dont
even
like
i
initially
thought
this
beer
was
too
hot
to
be
drinkable
but
as
it
warms
the
drinkability
is
greatly
enhanced
you
can
definitely
tell
that
this
is
a
10
brew
but
pretty
delicious
overall
on
tap
at
the
blind
tier
ale
hse
in
nyc
a
few
weeks
ago
and
reviewed
from
notes
pours
cloudy
darkish
smoky
almond
minor
light
tan
head
and
leaving
a
tiny
bubble
film
and
fine
light
lacing
the
nose
here
is
boldly
of
crisp
spicing
and
alcohol
one
sip
and
its
obvious
that
this
a
strong
heady
and
complex
brew
notes
of
currents
rum
brandy
burnt
grains
alot
going
on
here
not
for
the
faint
of
heartpalate
not
for
quaffing
and
not
for
fans
of
pissy
yellow
beer
fine
night
capperlate
night
sipper
pours
a
deep
brown
somewhat
hazy
with
a
big
lightbrown
head
smells
very
spicy
yeasty
with
hints
of
ripe
fruit
taste
is
very
powerful
yeast
spice
raisins
and
a
lot
of
alcohol
too
much
alcohol
very
sweet
it
is
medium
on
the
tongue
with
a
dryish
finish
the
alcohol
burn
makes
this
less
drinkable
than
i
would
prefer
but
all
in
all
an
occassional
treat
the
oak
aging
seems
to
take
a
little
roast
edge
off
the
standard
issue
quad
so
its
just
different
enough
to
be
new
and
still
comfortably
old
the
abv
raises
a
rambunctious
red
alert
and
only
a
simpleton
would
disregard
the
hightemp
warning
even
so
finishing
the
bottle
could
carry
consequences
and
yet
in
spite
of
this
i
did
enjoy
it
and
even
if
one
bottle
or
less
is
the
limit
it
does
leave
a
good
impression
in
the
end
a
22oz
bottle
poured
into
a
tulip
glass
i
was
trying
to
compare
this
to
quad
and
found
this
one
a
little
more
interesting
it
had
a
dark
amber
color
with
a
thin
head
it
had
a
sweet
fruity
aroma
with
a
vinous
character
an
explosion
of
taste
fruity
some
chocolate
yeasty
and
wine
i
thought
it
was
very
smooth
and
mellow
however
i
dont
think
id
drink
this
and
quad
together
in
one
sitting
again
next
time
blasphemy
alone
the
beer
pours
a
very
good
looking
darkish
brown
color
very
impressive
looking
beer
with
excellent
head
retention
and
good
lacing
the
nose
is
not
huge
but
one
gets
a
sense
of
sweet
spices
and
oak
on
the
nose
on
the
palate
this
beer
is
quite
sweet
with
candy
cherries
vanilla
chocolate
licorise
and
raisens
the
alcohol
is
pretty
noticeable
in
this
one
making
it
not
the
most
drinkable
of
beers
definitely
a
sipper
but
a
good
beer
for
all
that
the
beer
finishes
moderately
well
sweet
with
a
bit
of
crispnessdryness
at
the
end
a
very
good
beer
from
weyerbacher
albeit
not
the
easiest
beer
to
drink
given
the
high
abv
overall
i
highly
recommend
it
if
you
like
the
style
quads
on
their
own
are
a
bit
of
an
acquired
taste
so
i
think
the
same
can
be
said
about
blasphemy
pours
an
gorgeous
rubyorange
with
more
a
1
finger
head
that
leaves
a
few
leaves
of
lacing
the
smell
on
this
one
is
wonderful
candied
sugars
vanilla
a
hint
of
the
oak
the
taste
on
this
one
is
raw
nice
dark
fruit
brown
sugar
followed
by
a
nice
smooth
oak
back
and
a
pronounced
borderline
unpleasant
alcohol
bite
my
bet
would
be
that
this
one
will
be
very
tasty
if
cellared
for
a
while
to
mellow
out
the
alcohol
bite
still
this
one
exhibits
nice
flavor
complexity
is
quite
enjoyable
ill
probably
go
back
and
buy
a
few
bottles
to
hide
for
a
while
22oz

and

wood
banana
and
spice
all
play
prominent
roles
in
the
flavor
lighterbodied
little
carbonation
to
speak
of
a
pretty
decent
beer
more
mellow
and
drinkable
than
its
nonbarrelaged
cousin
i
want
to
try
this
one
after
it
has
cellared
a
while
right
now
it
is
very
hot
i
can
thank
the
florida
gators
for
this
one
drinkability
for
me
this
is
second
to
how
amazing
insanity
is
which
continues
to
be
one
of
my
favorites
and
i
say
that
especially
after
really
not
being
a
big
fan
of
eleven
at
all
heres
high
hopes
for
twelve
though
the
barrel
aging
for
weyerbacher
continues
to
be
a
great
experiment
and
one
ill
certainly
continue
to
look
forward
to
im
a
huge
fan
of
the
quad
by
itself
but
this
is
just
beyond
amazing
im
so
glad
they
continue
to
be
ballsy
and
not
only
be
experimental
but
make
great
beer
while
doing
it
oh
yeah
found
a
new
fave
pours
dark
brown
looks
a
bit
like
a
brown
ale
very
little
head
smells
sweet
way
to
sweet
however
the
taste
oh
yeah
how
to
describe
quite
sweet
but
balanced
with
the
high
alcohol
level
sweetness
is
like
figs
strange
artifical
sweetner
alcohol
and
spices
this
combo
just
works
and
it
is
damn
delicious
overall
this
is
a
very
serious
nightcap
sipping
beer
i
have
to
get
more
of
this
love
it
highly
recommended
wow
the
hits
just
keep
on
coming
form
this
brewery
that
stays
on
style
while
trying
to
be
different
blasphemy
is
a
big
beer
that
has
great
drink
ability
even
at
this
young
age
im
still
excited
about
the
possibilities
of
this
beer
as
it
ages
the
11
8
abv
does
not
hide
itself
it
attacks
your
tongue
throat
and
senses
right
off
the
bat
when
held
to
the
light
it
shows
to
be
a
beautiful
light
red
color
the
pour
for
me
was
into
a
large
goblet
that
produced
a
fine
off
white
head
the
early
flavor
is
all
candy
sugar
with
a
hint
of
vanilla
the
flavors
are
clean
leaving
a
light
aftertaste
that
fades
to
a
fruity
finish
the
glass
is
coated
with
the
oils
and
tannins
with
each
sip
mouthfeel
seem
perfect
for
the
style
drink
this
bad
boy
with
care
for
the
alcohol
can
and
will
get
you
this
is
another
one
of
those
beer
to
add
to
the
collection
for
future
use
some
winter
night
to
come
when
a
good
book
beckons
or
to
treasure
in
the
distant
future
as
the
flavors
meld
and
mature
light
red
body
with
a
small
white
head
and
not
much
carbonation
bubbles
head
leaves
a
small
white
ring

and
some

candi

and
vanilla
warming
sensatio
in
my
chestfizzy
carbonation
and
a
bit
creamy
from
the
vanilla
i
think
one
12
ounce
bottle
is
enough
for
me
the
first
sips
were
a
bit
out
of
the
ordinary
for
me
its
not
half
bad
at
all
i
like
it
and
would
recommend
it
but
now
to
a
new
craft
beer
drinkiner
or
the
faint
of
heart
this
brew
is
also
hot
i
have
one
in
my
cellar
and
i
think
a
year
there
will
do
some
good
the
oak
taste
is
tasty
but
overwhelming
all
in
the
same
the
drinkability
would
be
higher
but
i
started
to
feel
a
small
buzz
off
a
few
sips
deffinetly
sip
this
i
do
love
weyerbacher
but
this
one
is
a
little
odd
this
is
better
than
some
of
the
other
wood
aged
weyerbachers
like
prophecy
i
think
this
may
also
be
the
one
occasion
that
this
is
better
than
the
unoaked
version
ill
be
curious
to
see
what
this
does
with
some
age
on
it
actually
i
prefer
the
quad
over
this
but
i
still
am
enjoying
this
one
cheers
sidenote
i
aged
imho
croslingapr

mostly
clear
which
only
age
can
provide
i
picked
up
a
few
bottles
quadruple
delicious
love
this
beer
very
smooth
quad
this
is
a
great
easy
drinking
sipper
of
a
quad
been
meaning
to
try
this
for
close
to
4
years
now
no
pun
intended
this
is
a
really
spectacular
beer
dark
fruits
abound
a
great
yeasty
quality
that
doesnt
appear
often
in
american
versions
of
the
style
beautiful
overall
very
tasty
quad
worth
seeking
out
allagash
is
so
good
at
these
belgian
styles
perfect

to
open
up
for
juno
750ml
corked
and
caged
bottle
served
in
my
allagash
chalice
2014
vintage
pours
somewhere
between
cider
and
mahogany
in
color
with
a
slight
haze
to
the
clarity
and
a
rocky
two
inch
creamcolored
head
embedded
with
tiny
pinpricks
nose
is
somewhat
subdued
figs
and
yeast
taste
consistent
with
nose
however
theres
also
a
faint
medicinal
quality
and
a
trace
of
something
metallic
towards
the
back
mouthfeel
is
mediumlight
with
an
easy
even
carbonation
overall
a
decent
quad
but
the
pricepoint
18
49
and
overall
character
isnt
on
par
with
the
exemplars
of
the
style
e
g
st

etc
malty
not
sure
what
after
taste
is
pours
dark
amber
with
a
strong
smell
strong
beer
but
very
tasty
and
malty
drinkable
perhaps
too
drinkable
for
the
9oz
pour
great
beer
from
allagash
overall
wellbalanced
yet
complex
refreshing
yet
rich
practically
perfect
and
yet
there
is
just
a
tad
bit
lacking
this
beer
is
light
and
bright
for
a
quad
and
would
benefit
from
a
bit
more
heft
fantastic
balance
and
great
bubbly
mouthfeel
superb
beer
medium
body
with
creamy
very
fine
carbonation
and
a
slight
alcohol
warming
edit
no
it
was
not
intentional
that
i
gave
this
beer
a
score
of
4
4
but
yes
it
is
awesome
o
allagash
four
is
a
very
complex
beer
but
overly
so
and
the
shotgun
approach
to
flavors
hurt
the
overall
package
as
the
flavors
are
all
over
the
place
great
interplay
between
four
malts
four
hops
albeit
not
as
noticeable
and
four
yeasts
the
complexity
is
high
and
the
numerous
flavors
just
seem
balance
out
into
a
great
final
package
way
to
drinkable
for
a
10
bsda
overall
ill
up
the
score
on
this
because
its
frankly
a
very
good
beer
its
just
not
at
all
what
a
quad
should
be
in
my
books
id
have
another
one
of
these
anyday
o
this
is
a
wonderful
example
of
a
full
range
of
subtleties
that
combine
to
make
an
incredibly
enjoyable
beer
highly
recommend
especially
for
those
who
dont
need
to
be
smacked
in
the
mouth
in
order
to
enjoy
a
beer
o
a
nice
american
quad
with
quite
a
bit
of
complexity
and
depth
it
makes
for
a
nice
sipper
in
the
colder
months
definitely
on
the
drier
and
less
sweet
side
of
the
spectrum
but
that
only
allows
for
more
complexity
would
definitely
benefit
with
some
age
but
its
also
fine
fresh
give
it
a
go
i
should
have
sat
on
this
one
for
a
while
but
that
being
said
its
still
drinking
well
today
something
id
look
for
in
the
future
and
i
could
see
it
aging
gracefully
definitely
try
it
d
dare
i
say
i
perfer
this
over
three
philsophers
this
surely
packs
more
complexity
and
has
that
wonderful
nose
it
also
is
really
quite
easy
drinking
which
is
dangerous
for
a
10
abv
quad
one
of
the
few
american
examples
of
a
quad
that
i
both
find
interesting
but
amazing
poured
from
a
bottle
into
a
snifter
the
beer
is
a
deep
vibrant
rubybrown
coloring
with
a
short
stacked
frothy
filmy
offwhite
head
that
settles
into
a
sparse
filmy
coating
aromas
of
subtle
spicing
and
a
rich
bready
backbone
of
old
world
fruit
and
toasted
bread
boozy
highlights
throughout
the
nose
also
this
one
smells
rich
and
solid
flavors
are
rich
and
roasted
with
a
nutty
backbone
supporting
fig
and
black
cherry
sweetness
tart
and
rich
throughout
with
a
fruit
sugar
base
that
is
enduring
from
start
to
finish
spicing
comes
out
as
the
beer
warms
pepper
basil
oregano
nutmeg
and
clove
amongst
other
spices
you
could
sit
all
day
and
pick
apart
the
intricacies
of
this
one
amazing
the
body
is
smooth
throughout
but
avoids
overpowering
the
aftertaste
is
boozy
with
highlights
of
roasted
notes
and
old
world
fruit
sweetness
smooth
clean
finish
with
only
a
hint
of
sweet
linger
just
enough
to
entice
you
back
for
another
sip
solid
big
bold
beer
very
tasty
o
this
beer
aged
really
well
it
picked
up
some
definite
hints
as
if
it
had
been
barrel
aged
over
the
years
and
i
think
the
sweetness
has
increased
and
it
has
mellowed
overall
very
enjoyable
cant
believe
i
let
this
one
cellar
so
long
before
reviewing
it
overall
its
really
a
good
beer
but
it
has
its
faults
o
the
flavors
here
are
decent
but
i
could
use
more
dark
fruits
and
a
bit
more
complexity
the
esters
are
a
bit
harsh
and
do
not
mix
that
well
with
the
maltiness
allagash
has
a
rare
miss
on
its
hands
with
this
the
16
price
adds
to
the
disappointment
this
is
a
plush
fruity
estery
juicy
beer
there
are
some
spices
that
lend
balance
and
offer
depth
the
abv
is
really
well
hidden
making
this
a
dangerously
drinkable
beer
this
is
definitely
a
beer
worth
trying
o
add
this
to
my
list
of
allagash
awesomeness
my
review
numbers
may
be
a
little
misleading
if
youre
thinking
typical
quad
this
is
an
atypical
quad
imo
my
impression
of
the
beer
was
that
it
tasted
as
much
like
an
english
old
ale
or
strong
ale
as
much
as
a
traditional
quad
such
a
st
bernardus
or
a
pannepot
i
loved
the
flavor
and
feel
very
complex
and
elegant
very
classy
drinking
not
a
lingering
aftertaste
oi
had
hopes
that
this
would
be
my
first
excellent
quad
as
allagash
has
proven
they
can
knock
out
a
belgian
style
see
allagash
white
and
tripel
but
like
other
us
brewers
miss
the
complexity
deliciousness
exemplified
by
st
bernardus
abt
12
and
westy
xii
this
beer
needs
work
average
compared
to
us
versions
ive
tried
below
average
compared
to
belgians
o
a
very
interesting
quad
great
complexity
sweet
without
being
overly
so
like
a
lot
of
quads
nice
balance
of
sweetness
and
bitterness
to
boot
very
unique
o
what
a
delicious
beer
it
is
not
as
good
as
others
i
have
had
by
allagash
but
worth
a
try
i
recommend
it
overall
disappointing
i
am
an
allagash
fan
and
a
quad
fan
but
this
one
doesnt
really
do
it
for
me
overy
disappointing
to
have
just
an
average
brew
from
a
great
brewery
and
a
great
style
i
will
choose
either
dubbel
curieux
or
white
over
this
in
a
heartbeat
but
it
was
nice
to
try

belgian

maybe
a

super
easy
drinker
here
i
could
chug
this
10abv
all
day
its
got
a
great
flavour
but
really
is
basic
in
a
way
nonetheless
great
brew
and
id
have
again
wonder
how
it
would
age
o
overall
this
beer
was
a
bit
too
one
note
for
my
liking
which
is
a
shame
as
i
held
onto
this
for
so
long
sweet
malts
appear
at
first
in
the
taste
with
a
higher
than
expected
bitterness
that
gives
off
a
boozy
character
which
kicks
in
more
prominently
tears
into
my
sinuses
and
opens
the
passageway
yet
it
mellows
almost
as
quickly
as
it
explodes
leaving
a
dryer
lingering
finale
in
its
wake
overall
a
solid
quad
but
nothing
mindblowing
overall
not
bad
nice
malts
and
sweet
flavors
belgian
flavors
but
not
as
great
as
i
remember
bit
boozy
too
overall
not
a
bad
beer
really
but
i
think
allagash
does
some
better
beers
for
the
price
point
allagash
couriex
is
a
better
choice
in
my
opinion
just
a
lot
of
flavors
that
i
seem
to
be
missing
judging
by
the
label
and
the
body
doesnt
quite
have
enough

back

a
thick

the
color
of
the
beer
is
a

the

a

of

the
taste
is
predominantly
a
pleasantly
sour

mostly
cherry

the
hops
are
subtle
these
are
definitely
not
west

hops
the
10
abv
is
very
well
hidden
almost
no
burn
this
is
a
very
smooth
and
mild
quad
it
is
much
lighter
and
not
as
vinous
as
a
westvleteren
this
beer
really
tastes
like
a

to
me
the
only
negative
is
a
slightly
thin
body
and
mouthfeel

at

you
better

i
would
definitely
have
this
again
this
one
is
a
must
have

shop
has
it
regularly
and
i
get
a
bottle
probably
once
every
two
or
three
months
one
of
my
favorite
beers
the
beer
is
a
beautiful

a
nice

that
warms
the
stomach
nicely
it
has
a
nice
and
original
flavor
from
the
darkened

makes
me
think
of
nicely
toasted
grains
that

seem
to

thanks
to

beers
i
freaken
love
it
just
a
nice

to
drink
and
enjoy
so
good
enjoyed
this
one
on

at

color
with
a

looked
like
a

based
on
the
color
im
used
to
spicy
aroma
a
little
bitter
malty
taste
a
little
bit
sweet
but
certainly
not
as
cloying
and
raisinlike
as
ive
tasted
in
some
other
quads
ive
tried
drank
quite
easily
not
as
heavy
as
many
in
the
style
very
enjoyable
offering
o
a
nice
quad
though
very
sweet
definitely
one
youd
want
to
sip
not
gulp
that
said
allagash
has
some
better
offerings
its
pricey
too
so
its
a
onceinawhile
for
when
you
want
something
a
bit
different
overall
a
solid
beer
not
overly
impressive
but
seems
to
carry
several
of
the
distinct
attributes
of
belgianstyle
beers
a
little
more
bitter
than
i
would
have
hoped

really
nice

on
this
brew
it
could
easily
pass
for
a
belgian
quad
on
the
smell
taste
is
good
but
not
quite
up
to
the
smell
this
is
definitely
one
of
the
smoothest
malty
drinkable
quads
ive
ever
had
the
hops
are
hidden
but
you
get
some
of
them
in
the
taste
the
10
abv
is
there
w
a
little
bit
of
alcohol
burn
on
the
aftertaste
its
pretty
mellow
though
feel
is
silky
smooth
and
sweet
with
the
hop
bitterness
barely
there
overall
this
is
a
very
enjoyable
quad
definitely
in
the
top
3
or
4
american
quads

had
off

good
level

medium

overall
this
is
a
solid
quad
with
lots
of
nice
aromas
and
flavors
d
not
what
i
was
expecting
seems
either
past
its
prime
or
just
disjointed
and
heavy
became
very
sweet
the
longer
it
sat
in
the
glass
too
d
a
perfect
balanced
quad
i
enjoyed
this
one
very
much
o
this
was
odd
i
wasnt
too
thrilled
with
it
i
think
they
could
have
just
used
1
type
of
yeast
and
one
decent
fermentation
the
novelty
aspect
of
the
beer
is
great
but
the
execution
and
final
product
was
less
than
satisfying
overall
disappointed
doesnt
quite
compare
to
some
of
the
great
abbey
and
trappist
quads
but
the
allagash
holds
it
own
probably
the
best
americanmade
quad
ive
had
some
more
bready
toffeish
malt
flavors
and
this
stuff
would
be
fantastic

i
am

this
is
a
young
batch
very
tasty
nice
job
by
allagash
i
like
this
one
but
probably
not
enough
to
pony
up
the
this
one
usually
goes
for
medium
body
on
this
one
with
slightly
prickly
carboantion
overall
a
pretty
well
made
quad
lots
of
ingredients
seems
to
make
for
an
interesting
beer
on
here
this
beer
seems
to
do
better
with
age
maybe
i
should
wait
a
full
four
years
for
consistency
but
this
is
about
as
good
a
domestic
version
of
this
difficult
style
as
you
could
hope
for
poured
out
in
a
wineglass
this
beer
is
deep
ambercoloured
to
say
this
is
a
quad
i
am
not
sure
if
it
deserves
this
type
for
the
rest
this
is
a
very
good
and
very
drinkable
beer
with
a
nice
foamy
head
o
not
bad
but
not
at
all
memorable
definitely
an
example
of
bigger
not
being
better
this
brew
poured
out
as
a
brownish
orange
color
with
a
tan
foamy
head
the
smell
of
the
beer
had
a
mix
of
sweet
and
sour
aromas
the
taste
was
pretty
much
just
like
the
nose
but
was
mostly
on
the
sour
side
the
mouthfeel
was
decent
i
thought
this
beer
sounded
pretty
awesome
but
after
having
it
i
wasnt
all
that
impressed
with
it
i
was
pretty
bummed
out
actually
i
thought
would
have
been
better
o
a
far
cry
from
the
quality
ive
come
to
expect
from
allagash
the
beer
is
poorly
balanced
and
overly
alcoholic
with
a
mouthfeel
inconsistent
with
the
styles
big
dogs
this
beer
nearly
disappoints
last
time
i
will
buy
this
one
o
good
stuff
but
too
expensive
and
frankly
too
sweet
for
my
palate
also
i
find
it
to
be
over
carbonated
to
the
point
of
hurting
its
score
lighter
mid
body
with
a
soft
carbonation
dangerously
easy
drinking
cost
prevents
me
from
drinking
much
allagash
but
this
is
good
stuff
its
impressive
no
doubt
about
that
but
its
definitely
a
sipping
beer
food
pairings
brie
possibly
steak
are
possible
but
this
is
a
powerful
standalone
narrative
his
polished
leather
heels
clicked
lightly
on
the
linoleum
floor
waiting
with
knowing
expectations
of
his
own
ability
the
same
magazines
every
time
far
below
my
interests
yet
beyond
my
ability
to
resist
he
reached
forward
and
thumbed
lazily
through
a
copy
of
outdoor
monthly
noting
esoteric
information
about
tent
liners
this
wasnt
his
first
job
interview
but
his
resume
made
it
clear
that
he
was
overqualified
so
why
was
he
here
filling
a
middle
management
role
it
was
not
for
want
of
ambition
for
after
all
he
prepared
4
times
as
long
as
most
other
candidates
nor
was
it
for
want
of
character
his
euphemisms
and
passing
comments
regailed
even
the
most
dourfaced
water
cooler
circles
glade
plug
ins
figures
quite
the
way
to
garnish
the
first
foyer
that
expectant
clients
will
encounter
no
it
was
his
robust
complexity
that
was
his
own
undoing
the
sheer
force
of
his
resume
that
created
expectations
that
he
could
not
fill
and
pretentions
that
filled
the
void
there
was
a
condescending
upshot
to
the
end
of
his
sentences
that
connoted
that
all
parties
present
should
have
known
what
he
said
beforehand
how
long
did
they
happen
t0
say
he
requested
of
the
overqualified
intern
equally
nonplussed
with
the
generic
waiting
room
it
was
his
content
that
wowed
but
his
overall
presentation
the
custom
tailored
suit
the
wry
witticisims
that
ultimately
cost
him
that
job
it
did
not
matter
in
his
mind
he
knew
that
he
was
four
times
as
qualified
as
the
other
candidates
it
was
that
personal
victory
that
carried
the
day
i
enjoyed
the
four
but
it
wasnt
what
i
expected
if
it
were
a
little
heavier
i
think
i
would
have
gotten
more
of
the
4x
approach
and
would
have
been
able
to
taste
more
of
the
yeasts
and
hops
they
emphasize
so
much
this
beer
pours
a
copper
color
with
a
nice
off
white
head
the
smell
is
spicey
slightly
sweet
and
malty
with
a
small
alcohol
tinge
to
it
the
flavor
follows
the
smell
with
the
spice
and
malt
in
the
front
with
a
little
alcohol
in
the
finish
the
mouthfeel
is
medium
body
with
good
carbonation
overal
this
beer
is
good
would
drink
again
but
its
a
littel
pricey
overall
a
very
nice
beer
that
was
a
hit
with
the
family
the
abv
is
very
well
hidden
a
top
notch
brew
mouthfeel
is
smooth
and
creamy
but
doesnt
finish
quite
as
dry
as
expected
overall
a
different
take
on
the
quad
but
certainly
one
worth
trying
pours
a
seethru
redtinged
copper
with
bubbly
head
that
died
quick
and
left
no
lace
the
first
i
notice
in
the
aroma
is
the
yeast

definitely
comes
out
theres
also
that
candy
sugary
aroma
though
mild
as
well
as
that
faint
citric
hop
aroma
thicker
and
fullerbodied
chewey
even
the
beer
is
greatly
balanced
also
prickly
with
great
carbonation
the
sticky
heaviness
of
the
beer
is
countered
and
not
murkey
i
pick
up
sweet
malts
like
candy
sugar
and
some
bready
malts
as
well
also
picking
up
some
tartness
like
cherry
and
a
hint
of
citric
hop
flavoring
fines
nice
and
smooth

it

drink
a

if

i
guess
ill
have
to
wait

to
get
more

i
thought
this

was
a

better
with
more

a
nice

my
only
criticism
is
that
the
hops
and

notes
clash

overall

definitely

d
nice

in
every
respect

no

its
easy
enjoyable
to
quaff
d
a
wonderful
brew
especially
on
cask
overall
this
is
a
very
good
beer
i
would
not
mind
drinking
another
one
of
these
notes
allagash
has
captured
the
right
balance
of
the
yeast
malt
and
minimal
hops
in
a
classic
quad
taste
that
any
brewer
within
belgium
would
and
should
be
proud
of
i
consider
this
and
three
philosophers
to
be
good
examples
of
american
brewers
ability
to
produce
excellent
belgian

not
a
good

aroma
is
of
raisins
figs
dates
and
sweet
malts
taste
follows
pretty
closely
the
aromas
and
is
also
moderately
sweet
warming
and
slightly
sour
on
the
back
of
the
tongue
tremendously
smooth
to
drink
at
10
the
alcohol
is
very
well
hidden
by
the
lovely
flavors
and
sweetness
of
the
malts
and
the
belgian
yeast
a
stellar
beer
and
a
very
special
treat
a
great
transitional
beer
for
people
that
dont
normally
drink
good
beer
also
as
large
as
the
head
was
the
beer
is
not
that
carbonated
which
i
really
appreciate
the
beer
is
not
that
thick
in
the
mouthfeel
making
it
easy
to
drink
at
10
percent
this
is
very
drinkable
and
could
be
dangerous
since
you
cant
taste
any
of
the
alcohol
a
great
beer
had
on
tap
at
great
lost
bear
its
actually
fairly
hazy
in
the
glass
a
big
turn
on
for
me
this
beer
actually
blew
my
mind
it
is
absolutely
one
of
the
best
i
have
ever
had
the
privilege
of
drinking
fairly
sweet
but
with
a
cutting
edge
that
managed
to
quickly
dispel
any
and
all
other
flavors
smooth
yet
not
overpowering
the
alcohol
is
really
well
masked
here
definitely
a
beer
worth
buying
again
d
this
is
a
really
great
quad
great
flavors
and
aromas
d
easy
to
get
to
the
bottom
of
this
bottle
but
its
a
little
strong
to
consider
another
glad
i
tried
this
allagash
never
lets
me
down
750ml
corked
and
caged
batch

and
a
heck
of
a
way
to
start

weekend
poured
into

steady
stream
of
bubbles
up

to

smells
of
orange
sherbet
raisins
and
cinnamon
tastes
like
heaven
with
boobs
slightly
burnt
caramel
up

then
tastes
like
those
orange
creme
candies
your
grandmother
always
had
in
a
cutglass
dish
finishes
with
a
sharp
woody
note
that
makes
me
thirsty
for
more
wow
mouthfeel
is
nicely
carbonated
assertively
bubbly
up
front
and
then
a
touch
oily
and
almost
sticky
its
got
a
body
to
stand
up
to
the
carbonation
very
drinkable
it
has
an
alcohol
warmth
but
it
only
hints
at
the
10
the
label
promises
very
sippable
and
sip
i
shall
im
going
to
do
less
typing
and
more
drinking
now
overall
a
good
quad
but
not
amazing
good
but
not
as
good
as
the
real
thing
from
those
delightful
trappists
imo
d
one
sweet
and
complex
american
quad
here
congrats
to
allagash
theyve
pulled
off
a
great
example
of
a
quad
and
it
only
took
having
to
4x
everything
opened
a
bottle
of
four
with
my
wife
on
our
fourth
wedding
anniversary
get
it
poured
into
ommegang
three
philosopher
chalices
dark
cloudy
orange
color
almost
ciderlike
appearance
not
a
whole
lot
of
carbonation
slight
white
head
formed
spicy
and
floral
smell
taste
was
a
bit
different
for
a
quad
it
had
that
sugary
characteristic
and
a
dried
plum
flavor
to
it
but
it
also
had
a
faint
hop
bite
to
it
this
i
did
not
expect
but
i
ended
up
liking
this
twist
even
though
this
bottle
has
been
aged
for
about
a
year
there
was
still
a
bit
of
a
hot
alcohol
note
present
very
smooth
beer
to
drink
though
paired
well
with
a
chocolate
torte
this
is
a
worthwhile
beer
to
try
merely
because
it
is
a
very
unique
american
expression
of
a
classic
belgian
style
glad
i
had
the
chance
to
try
this
not
sure
ill
seek
it
out
again
body
a
bit
thin
for
the
style
good
stuff
perhaps
closer
to
a
bsda
this
is
a
really
good
beer
it
pretty
much
follows
what
a
quad
should
be
like
most
beers
of
this
style
though
a
bit
to
dry
for
my
tastes
still
something
i
would
recommend
and
definitely
worth
a
try
d
one
to
share
a
bottle
of
or
sip
on
after
dinner
would
probably
go
well
with
a
plate
of
gouda
cheese
and
rye
crackers
i
had
one
oyster
with
it
and
it
didnt
compliment
as
well
as
id
hoped
oh
well
still
fine
crating
and
a
good
version
of
the
style
dare
i
say
better
than
ommegang
a
spectacular
beer
truly
wonderful
to
this
palate
the
balance
is
spoton
and
its
full
of
flavor
the
best
description
i
can
put
to
word
is
that
when
you
take
a
sip
and
the
full
sensory
experience
manifests
as
a
tangible
feeling
on
my
tongue
and
subsequently
registers
electronically
in
my
brain
it
is
euphoric
this
is
felt
at
first
sip
and
last
sip
and
each
sip
in
between
the
10
tends
to
help
the
euphoria
near
the
end
this
beer
pours
a
cloudy
red
color
there
is
no
head
to
speak
of
the
aroma
is
dates
star
anise
cardamom
and
a
soft
sweet
maltiness
it
is
a
very
delicate
aroma
for
such
a
large
beer
but
it
works
the
taste
is
more
powerful
than
the
aroma
but
just
as
complex
there
is
an
abundance
of
spices
and
malt
nothing
really
stands
out
and
that
is
was
stands
out
in
this
beer
if
i
think
about
tasting
a
certain
aspect
of
taste
then
take
a
sip
i
taste
that
aspect
if
i
think
about
another
the
same
thing
happens
this
really
is
a
well
balanced
beer
the
mouthfeel
is
of
the
smoothest
silk
imaginable
the
carbonation
is
light
and
fine
overall
this
is
a
very
nice
beer
im
not
sure
if
id
call
it
the
best
quad
ive
yet
tasted
but
it
is
up
there
just
finished
another
bottle
9110
i
agree
with
my
previous
rating
excellent
beer
plan
to
buy
another
for
the
cellar
this
strikes
me
as
a
very
american
quadrupel
taking
the
subtle
fruity
complexity
of
a
belgian
quad
and
ratcheting
it
up
to
the
next
extreme
level
it
is
a
little
much
for
me
d
i
could
enjoyably
sip
this
beer
especially
paired
with
the
gouda
i
definitely
needed
help
finishing
the
big
bottle
though
overall
the
mouth
feel
of
the
beer
is
creamy
soft
carbonated
and
smooth
the
body
of
the
beer
is
medium
and
the
finish
is
light
this
is
a
very
tasty
quad
although
i
can
distinguish
the
different
malts
and
hops
the
beer
is
well
rounded
and
made
well
what
else
do
you
expect
from
allagash
this
is
a
very
good
beer
you
can
almost
taste
all
four
fermentation
periods
with
each
sip
no
just
kidding
pours
a
very
dark
brown
with
almost
no
head
but
then
again
who
really
needs
to
fight
through
a
good
one
to
get
to
the
beer
am
i
right
or
what
i
wonder
if
anyone
will
respond
ok
sorry
tangent
and
back
to
the
beer
does
leave
a
nice
layer
of
film
on
the
glass
the
nose
is
very
good
and
complex
scents
of
plums
and
sugars
very
sweet
in
taste
as
well
the
malts
really
out
play
the
hops
in
this
one
the
bottle
says
the
score
is
4
malts
to
4
hops
but
it
tastes
more
like
8
to
1
in
favor
of
the
malts
taste
has
some
diactyl
in
it
but
for
the
most
part
its
sweet
like
sugar
with
a
little
fruitiness
tastes
more
like
grapes
even
though
there
is
plums
in
the
nose
feels
very
good
going
down
surprisingly
a
medium
body
with
not
a
lot
of
resistance
by
the
throat
enjoy
this
one
for
a
10er
suprisingly
easy
to
handle
hides
the

one
of
the
more
drinkable
quads
ive
had
i
think
this
bottle
has
a
few
years
on
it
so
didnt
notice
the
booze
heat
that
others
have
remarked
on
quite
smooth
not
the
most
complex
quad
out
there
but
still
a
solid
drink
pours
a
medium
brown
colored
body
with
a
white
head
diminishing

strong
fruity
aroma

not

carbonated
soft
mouthfeel
some
hops
but
very
hidden
overall
very
very
solid
and
definitley
a
fine
example
of
the
style
i
would
have
no
issues
at
all
with
having
this
one
every
day
and
to
be
honest
it
looks
as
though
the
age
has
mellowed
it
quite
nicely
d
this
is
a
good
quad
but
it
reminds
me
of
three
philosophers
which
is
half
the
cost
and
pretty
much
twice
the
value
i
really
dont
see
myself
paying
17
to
grab
this
again
d
very
very
tasty
and
impressively
complex
lots
and
lots
going
on
here
drinkability
is
nice
as
well
it
manages
a
fairly
hoppy
balance
for
the
style
considering
all
of
the
different
sugary
flavors
that
are
at
work
i
found
this
for
6
for
a
750ml
bottle
well
worth
the
price
this
is
a
fun
bear
to
be
appreciatedthe
complexity
of
the
flavor
outshines
any
alcohol
meaning
if
you
come
across
this
on
tap
sit
and
stay
a
while
an
outstanding
beer
that
is
extremely
drinkable

a
very
good
american

this
is
a

a

had
this
on
cask
at
rusticos
glassware
giveaway
served
after
they
ran
out
of
black
ive
really
been
enjoying
belgians
lately
and
this
was
certainly
no
exception
it
was
a
hazy
dark
amber
with
some
light
tan
head
it
smelled
a
bit
faint
but
like
creamy
belgian
yeast
and
mulling
spices
and
toffee
delicious
it
tasted
similar
to
the
smell
but
bolder
and
with
a
lot
of
nuances
and
complexities
that
im
sure
i
missed
split
this
pint
with
a
friend
and
had
already
had
a
couple
pints
before
my
main
thought
was
how
surprisingly
similar
this
tasted
to
st
bernardus
which
is
one
of
my
alltime
favorites
however
the
key
difference
was
the
body
and
feel
despite
four
being
on
cask
st
bernardus
from
a
bottle
somehow
manages
to
be
much
smoother
and
silkier
four
was
a
little
thin
and
flat
id
probably
normally
give
the
mouthfeel
a
4
but
considering
it
was
on
cask
i
had
to
dock
it
a
half
point
for
not
living
up
to
my
hopesexpectations
otherwise
this
was
a
very
enjoyable
beer
great
to
sip
and
contemplate
but
all
to
easy
to
gulp
for
this
price
level
i
certainly
i
am
not
impressed
allagash
has
many
great
brews
and
i
would
not
consider
this
to
be
one
of
them
drinkability
is
high
this
is
the
second
time
i
had
this
brew
and
i
bought
it
this
time
just
to
review
it
because
i
knew
i
liked
it
kind
of
expensive
though
d
a
commendable
quad
definitely
a
sipper
nice
but
not
aweinspiring
somewhat
of
a
clean
flavor
for
a
quad
im
wondering
if
the
fourth
fermentation
took
out
so
much
sugar
that
the
beer
is
left
a
little
thinner
still
its
very
enjoyable
and
smooth
this
quadrupel
should
not
be
missed
sampled
on
draft
this
past
weekend
at
milltown
pours
amberhoney
with
about
1
of
head
initial
aromas
give
off
clove
grapes
and
nutmeg
upon
sampling
this
tasty
beer
the
aromas
give
way
to
a
light
sweetness
and
you
cant
taste
the
alcohol
its
got
a
medium
mouthfeel
not
very
heavy
but
sweet
so
it
stays
with
you
flavor
profile
expands
with
each
taste
and
as
the
beer
warms
grapes
give
way
to
tart
apple
at
10
for
my
12
fl
oz
pour
i
was
tempted
to
order
another
one
as
i
got
through
one
rather
quickly
yummy
it
would
have
been
nice
to
get
a
little
information
blurb
on
the
bottle
about
the
quadruple
fermentation
but
its
a
nice
bottle
regardless
toasted
malts
lead
off
with
tangy
and
sweet
tropical
fruits
following
sugary
grapes
and
candy
malt
midpalate
caramel
cookie
dough
and
woody
tannins
into
the
finish
slightly
warming
with
lingering
fruits
and
yeastiness
fullbodied
with
lively
carbonation
one
of
the
lighterhued
quads
i
have
tried
and
a
good
one
at
that
d
this
is
a
very
nice
big
beer
it
has
a
wide
range
of
complex
flavors
this
could
almost
be
considered
a
dubbel
its
easier
to
handle
and
relatively
drier
than
most
quads
ive
had
certainly
too
dark
for
a
tripel
but
lacks
the
raisin
and
sourness
most
dubbels
tend
to
have
wellcrafted
warming
gets
you
drunk
a
joy
pours
a
murky
reddishmahogany
color
smallish
tan
head
fades
into
a
fine
film
atop
the
beer
no
lacing
to
speak
of
lots
of
raisin
sugary
sweetness
and
dark
fruit
on
the
nose
taste
follows
the
nose
loads
of
sugary
malty
flavors
a
bit
of
alcohol
heat
fullbodied
lots
of
lingering
spice
and
some
nice
bellywarming
alcohol
this
is
good
stuff
d
this
is
a
good
american
version
of
a
quadrupel
very
tasty
and
easy
to
drink

mild

to
the
aroma
too
no
alcohol
aroma
to
speak
of
the
taste
is
sweet
noticable
sugary
taste
kind
of
tastes
like
caramel
the
malt
in
this
overpowers
the
hops
though
the
hops
are
still
there
youd
expect
more
of
a
malt
taste
with
a
quad
so
this
delivers
the
alcohol
comes
through
after
swallowing
not
a
whole
lot
of
bitterness
to
this
its
got
a
heavy
mouthfeel
to
it
definitely
a
sipping
beer
quite
an
enjoyable
drinking
experience
mouthfeel
is
full
bodied
and
heavy
drinkability
is
great
well
balanced
hiding
its
alcohol
pretty
well
a
nice
example
of
the
style
d
this
beers
excellent

justify
its

be

taste

some

it
malt
and
roasted

has
a
slightly
bitter
ending
i
know
this
was
brewed
with
a
lot
of
fours
and
this
should
result
in
a
crisp
and
clean
beer
this
is
certainly
crisp
but
but
everything
doesnt
quite
work
well
together
here
this
will
certainly
warm
you
up
relax
you
and
leave
a
nice
sweetness
behind
after
each
sip
but
id
prefer
an
abbey
or
a
dubbel
over
this
certainly
one
of
the
boldest
belgianstyle
beers
ive
had
in
quite
some
time
d
very
good
but
the
high
abv
would
be
tough
to
have
several
of
these
md
medium
carbonation
and
texture
alcohol
is
a
bit
too
evident
in
the
flavor
for
you
to
have
a
couple
of
these
all
said
and
done
though
the
flavor
and
texture
of
this
beer
one
that
you
could
enjoy
for
one
or
two
pours
a
dark
brown
with
amber
edges
and
beige
head
aroma
of
spice
roasted
malt
hops
dark

is
similar
to
aroma
with
dark

malts
and

cane
high
abv

very
well
masked

a
solid
quadrupel
lighter

fruitier
than
most
but
still
distinctly
quadrupel
like
in
its
profile
a
very
interesting
and
pleasant
beer
attractive
aromatic
and
tasty
though
the

is
a

pissed
that
i

up

worth

the

benefits
from
all
the
malts

its
complex
and
enhanced
by
strong
yeasts
there
is
toffee
caramel
butter
toasted

wood
and
herbal

the
appearance
is
brownamber
with
a

the
flavor
is
just
like
the
aroma
with
a
bourbon
element
the
palate
is
nice
and
chewy
this
is
a
good
beer
but
the
finish
is
just
to
acidic
for
me
grab
a
bottle
if
you
can
afford
it
get
a
few
and
age
them
this
seems
like
a
beer
that
would
develop

aged

i
had
no

drinking
two
full
glasses
despite
a
mild
boozyness
pretty
good
beer
from
the
brewers
at
allagash
an
approachable
yet
still
complex
quad
cheers
and
keep
up
the
good
work
mouthfeeldrinkability
this
beer
is
getting
better
each
moment
ill
absolutely
suggest
letting
it
come
to
cellar
temperature
before
pouring
as
practically
all
previous
numbers
have
risen
at
least
a
halfpoint
in
that
time
the
texture
in
the
mouth
is
creamy
yet
subtle
and
effervescent
and
each
remaining
sip
comes
with
enjoyment
and
appreciation
a
delicious
rewarding
beer
that
was
worth
waiting
for
pours
a
ruddy
dark
brown
color
with
a
gorgeous
head
that
goes
nowhere
as
soon
as
the
cork
was
popped
the
aroma
was
very
evident
especially
as
i
poured
the
beer
into
my
duvel

strong
aromas
of
dark
fruits
candied
apples
pears
grapes
candy

belgian

quite

you
keep

take

it

i
love
this
beer
its
just
as
good
as
i
remember
it
to
be
it
is
a
good
beer
but
i
dont

i
would
purchase
it
again
incredible

dont

the

drinkability
at
10
and
a

is
excellent
another
terrific
offering
from
allagash
this
is
a
quad
not
to
be
missed
very
well
done
drinkability
is
here
but
at
10
abv
it
is
most
certainly
a
beer
to
savor
and
sip
very

is

quadrupels
are

alley
but
this

is
an
example
of
the
style
that
i
can
appreciate
4

d
this
is
one
thatll
leave
a
massive
hangover
given
the
sugar
and
abv
so
i
guess
thats
a
compliment
because
id
probably
drink
way
too
much
of
this
if
given
the
chance
im
a
fan
of
the
style
this
one
left
me
heartily
underwhelmed
disappointing
drinkability
at
10
abv
probably
not
that
drinkable
in
large
quantities
but
i
dont
care
this
is
a
delicious
brew
an
excellent
quadrupel
in
the
same
mold
as
the
great
westvleteren
appears
reddishbrown
with
a
thin
creamcolored
head
strong
candi
sugar
which
lends
a
strong
sweetness
to
both
the
aroma
and
the
taste
strong
dark
fruits
on
the
taste
and
the
typical
belgian
yeast
slightly
metallic
on
the
finish
but
also
very
warming
and
smooth
drinkability
havent
been
to
impressed
with
many
of
allagashs
offerings
but
this
one
does
have
some
charm
not
a
quad
id
grab
again
though
it
was
a
pleasant
experience
let
it
warm
a
bit
so
it
will
blossom
d
for
a
10
abv
this
one
is
amazingly
drinkable
i
could
see
myself
drinking
this
way
too
fast
if
i
didnt
know
it
was
so
powerful
besides
just
the
aforementioned
bottlingcorking
issues
this
one
seems
to
be
a
bit
rough
around
the
edges
its
good
and
pretty
tasty
but
not
a
great
beer
d
one
of
the
best
beers
ive
had
in
a
while
just
explodes
with
great
flavours
when
it
enters
your
mouth
really
good
stuff
one
of
the
most
drinkable
10
beers
out
there
d
this
is
a
very
nice
quad
very
complex
and
somewhat
mild
there
are
flavors
here
that
are
much
more
complex
than
my
palate
this
is
what
i
imagine
a
great
quad
to
be
the
alcohol
is
there
but
it
is
much
milder
than
in
other
examples
of
this
style
i
have
tried
probably
my
favorite
from
allagash
so
far
i
will
pick
this
up
again
this
beer
reminds
me
of
st
bernardus
12
but
not
westvleteren
the
carbonation
like
many
quads
is
quite
high
and
the
beer
needs
some
time
to
mellow
out
before
you
can
actually
taste
it
once
settled
theres
a
relatively
good
but
not
great
mixture
of
caramel
malts
with
dark
fruits
this
one
drinks
ohso
smoothly
and
against
stiff
competition
in
the
style
holds
its
own
but
doesnt
stand
out
overall
wellmade
and
an
excellent
example
of
the
style
d
im
struggling
to
get
by
the
10
abv
but
confess
this
is
one
of
the
best
ales
ive
had
to
date
world
class
drinkable
stuff
that
i
suppose
could
age
beautifully
but
i
havent
the
patience
enjoy
this
one
on
its
own
in
the
best
glass
you
own
wow
overall
not
the
typical
quad
but
i
think
a
little
age
would
do
wonders
d
really
nice
had
this
after
a
dogfish
120
so
anything
is
easy
drinking
after
that
one
of
the
better
quads
i
have
had
not
made
in
belgium
glad
i
got
to
try
this
but
i
can
never
bring
myself
to
plop
down
the
18
bucks
to
buy
a
bottle
as
there
is
too
much
good
stuff
out
there
for
less
d
drinkability
was
ok
with
the
hot
and
spicy
alcohol
fusels
on
the
finish
this
is
best
reserved
as
a
slow
sipper
where
one
bottle
1
pt
9
oz
should
be
more
then
plenty
for
one
person
and
probably
best
suited
shared
with
a
friend
drinkability
i
should
probably
buy
another
bottle
for
aging
i
think
this
ale
needs
to
be
properly
aged
before
it
becomes
more
drinkable
the
alcohol

is
almost
too

it
to
be

may

i
remember
1
year
didnt
change
it
much
this
is
a
fine
example
of
an
american
quadrupel
i
highly
recommend
it
to
anyone
seeking
a
representative
example
of
the
style
i
wasnt
overly
impressed
with
this
beer
but
it
was
still
worth
getting
again
good
flavors
and
fairly
easy
to
drink
for
the
alcohol
content
a
very
nice
beer
unfortunately
i
opened
up
a
rochefort
8
right
after
i
tasted
this
one
and
it
kind
of
left
the
it
in
the
dust
none
the
less
some
good
stuff
d
this
is
a
great
example
of
an
american
quad
well
worth
seeking
out
cheers
beer
enthusiasts
rasins
and
dark
dried
fruits
are
mingled
with
a
mega
dose
of
earthy
malt
spicy
yeast
and
rich
warm
alcohol
this
one
intensifies
as
it
warms
up
lingering
aftertaste
is
a
bit
odd
however
cant
put
my
finger
on
it
after
my
relatively
small
glass
of
it
i
already
was
feeling
the
10
its
hidden
fairly
well
if
i
guessed
the
abv
id
have
put
it
around
8
d
its
good
d
somebody
get
me
a
light
cigar
excellent
yet
different
from
many
of
the
quads
ive
had
which
tend
to
have
a
much
richer
character
yet
this
one
was
more
enjoyable
d
high
carbonation
on
a
beer
that
isnt
really
refreshing
is
just
a
strange
combination
that
doesnt
entice
me
to
drink
more
the
noticable
alcohol
makes
for
a
slightly
rough
finish
as
well
d
a
good
but
not
great
quadrupel
however
i
feel
this
may
have
overaged
so
i
will
have
to
come
back
to
this
one
again
hints
of
complexity
but
falls
a
little
flat
and
short
of
expectations
a
very
interesting
brew
and
one
i
would
recommend
at
least
trying
drinks
well
enough
but
it
is
a
bit
sweet
and
high
in
alcohol
to
drink
too
much
of
this
on
its
own
paired
pretty
well
with
a
grilled
steak
and
some
sauteed
veggies
thick
creamy
mouthfeel
low
to
medium
carbonation
coats
my
entire
mouth
with
fruit
sweetness
but
not
cloying
very
drinkable
brew
for
the
abv
four
is
interesting
and
even
considering
the
exceptionalexcessive
sweetness
and
10
abv
drinking
this
one
bombers
no
struggle
but
i
wouldnt
really
want
a
second
i
appreciate
the
complexity
of
flavors
and
the
smoothness
of
the
four
in
the
same
realm
as
a
good
strong
dark
belgian
ale
like
the
chimay
but
i
wouldnt
choose
this
to
have
everyday
too
sweet
mainly
notes
decent
stuff
but
clearly
not
the
best
quad
around
this
is
a
fantastic
beer
regardless
of
the
final
rating
overall
very
drinkable
but
beware
the
high
abv
pours
deep
amber
red
with
a
frothy
head
that
disappears
quickly
aroma
of
candies

and

sweet
malts
present
right
up
front
fairly
complex
with
notes
of
candied
sugar
dark
fruits
and
citrus
followed
by
alcohol
finishing
slightly
bitter
i
like
to
see
my
quadrupels
hide
their
alcohol
a
little
more
effectively
but
an
interesting
concept
and
a
quite
enjoyable
beer
mouthfeel
is
mediumfull
bodied
yeasty
semisweet
and
finishing
with
doughy
raisins
along
with
black
plums
lingering
body
could
be
a
little
richer
carbonation
is
high
does
not
compare
favorably
to
authentic
examples
of
the
style
still
this
beer
is
pretty
easy
to
drink
despite
the
high
abv
overall
not
a
bad
stab
at
the
style
especially
coming
from
an
american
brewery
although
allagash
has
certainly
produced
better
beers
pours
a
deep
cloudy

white

very
appley

mouthfeel
is

drinkability

is
mia
certainly
my
favorite
american
made

so
far
props
to
allagash
and
thanks
to

pours
cloudy
brown
with
a
large
cream
head
that
settles
quickly
smells
of
caramel
tart
cherries
candy
sugar
peppery
yeast
and
alcohol
aroma
is
a
little
thin
until
the
beer
has
had
a
chance
to
breathe
and
warm
a
bit
the
flavor
is
a
little
cloying
initially
sweet
caramel
and
sugar
with
alcohol
and
cherry
overtones
a
peppery
center
leads
to
a
surprisingly
dry
and
hopfilled
finish
in
the
mouth
the
beer
is
relatively
light
with
moderately
strong
carbonation
ends
up
feeling
a
bit
astringent
an
interesting
american
interpretation
of
the
quad
style
though
not
the
strongest
in
beer
in
the
allagash
lineup
poured
into
a
snifter
four
pours
a
rich
ambermahogany
with
a
solid
white
head
with
good
retention
very
nice
lacing
as
well
aromas
are
of
fall
fruits
apples
pears
figs
and
some
golden
raisins
as
well
as
winter
spices
tastes
match
these
aromas
perfectly
very
fruity
mixed
with
clove
and
nutmeg
sweet
and
wonderful
mouthfeel
is
smooth
not
too
heavy
for
a
quad
and
just
outstanding
i
could
drink
this
forever
almost
like
i
did
when
i
toured
the
brewery
and
they
had
the
four
w
strawberries
try
drinking
that
at
930
am
it
was
great
a
pretty
decent
quad
which
ironically
earns
all
4s
for
this
four
had
ontap
at
brickstore
pub
in
decatur
ga
pours
a
dark
brown
with
a
slight
amber
tint
quite
a
head
on
this
beer
aroma
is
very
sweet
i
got
alot
of
candy
and
sugar
in
the
taste
im
sure
part
of
it
was
the
alcohol
beer
was
very
effervescent
but
not
to
a
point
that
would
make
it
unenjoyable
overall
a
great
beer
overall
very
nice
for
the
style
at
first
i
thought
the
taste
was
too
onedimensional
but
as
it
warmed
i
warmed
up
to
it
good
job
pours
dark
copper
to
amber
quite
hazy
almost
no
head
just
a
faint
covering
of
cream
bubbles
aroma
is
a
nice
sweet
appleyness
cinnamon
and
brown
sugar
dehydrated
sweet
apples
and
a
hint
of
pruniness
as
well
taste
is
a
nice
apple
flavor
mixing
with
some
dry
oakiness
not
quite
tart
but
not
sweet
there
are
hints
of
raisiny
sweetness
up
front
and
in
the
finish
mouthfeel
is
on
light
to
medium
very
low
carbonation
keeps
it
thinner
which
is
quite
nice
drying
in
the
finish
with
a
little
spicy
dance
of
hops
and
alcohol
overall
a
great
beer
for
me
the
alcohol
was
very
well
masked
and
shoed
itself
in
the
right
amounts
mouthfeel
was
dead
on
and
i
loved
the
hints
of
pruney
raisiny
maltiness
that
would
pop
up
every
now
and
again
poured
a
light
crimson
red
that
was
blended
in
with
some
orange
coloring
it
had
a
tall
head
of
white
foam
that
had
really
good
retention
that
left
behind
a
small
white
film
and
few
spots
of
white
lace
it
had
a
great
lightly
sour
aroma
of
ripe
juicy
fruits
way
too
many
to
list
yeast
and
a
small
spatter
of
bitter
hops
in
the
background
toward
the
bottom
of
the
glass
the
aroma
will
get
very
oaky
and
sour
these
fruits
in
the
aroma
were
so
good
i
couldnt
stop
smelling
this
beer
the
taste
was
very
fruity
with
toasted
malts
a
pinch
of
yeast
and
a
slight
touch
of
oak
and
citrus
hops
at
the
end
the
oak
was
a
nice
touch
the
mouthfeel
was
slick
as
hell
i
had
no
idea
from
the
mouthfeel
that
this
beer
had
a
high
abv
i
had
to
find
out
from
the
bartender
that
this
beer
had
a
high
abv
besides
that
this
beer
had
an
aftertaste
of
juicy
fruits
yeast
and
a
pinch
of
citrus
hops
this
was
one
to
nice
beer
to
try
ontap
it
is
expensive
to
try
ontap
but
its
worth
it
just
a
reminder
this
beer
will
sneak
up
on
you
like
it
did
me
good
beercomplex
and
hard
to
read
very
sweet
sugar
cane
and
molasses
in
the
aroma
tons
o
dark
fruit
mix
in
with
the
quaff
along
with
a
pop
of
medicinal
cherry
belgium
yeast
supplement
the
taste
and
this
one
finishes
with
a
hoppy
kick
almost
raspy
the
alcohol
is
there
but
remains
in
the
background
and
does
not
distract
from
an
overall
tasty
brew
750ml
corked
and
caged
pours
a
mud
puddle
brown
color
with
a
disappointing
light
tan
head
that
quickly
faded
into
a
light
ring
around
the
glass
the
smell
is
of
raisin
some
red
wine
and
brown
sugarmolasses
starts
off
very
sweet
a
big
dark
fruit
blast
centering
around
the
flavors
of
raisin
and
red
wine
grapes
there
are
hints
of
carob
and
perhaps
fig
the
feel
is
light
but
not
watery
with
fizzy
carbonation
finishes
sweet
definitely
a
brew
with
some
big
bold
aromas
and
flavors
there
seems
to
be
something
missing
from
this
quad
perhaps
more
of
a
malt
presence
the
beer
looks
and
feels
thin
a
good
quad
but
nothing
too
distinguishing
pours
a
hazy
burnt
orange
with
ruby
brown
highlights
decent
initial
head
that
fades
quickly
to
a
very
thin
ring
that
leaves
some
spotty
lacing
smells
of
macerated
fruit
bubblegum
lightly
of
bananas
and
there
is
a
whiff
of
oak
at
the
end
tastes
even
better
with
the
same
fruity
start
of
bright
fruity
esters
banana
a
slight
touch
of
clove
some
oak
and
a
tannice
bitterness
at
the
finish
and
more
clove
as
well
mouthfeel
is
substantial
creamy
and
a
bit
tannic
at
the
end
the
alcohol
is
hidden
very
well
and
it
is
delicious
ive
had
the
barrel
aged
version
of
this
and
that
was
sublime
this
is
merely
very
good
ive
been
sitting
on
this
one
for
a
year
poured
into
a
tulip
a
cloudy
dark
ambermahongy
color
some
carbonation
little
fizzy
tannish
head
which
leaves
some
sticky
lacing
afterwards
the
nose
is
malty
slight
yeast
dark
fruits
galore
slight
oakyness
and
caramel
the
taste
is
sweet
maltyyeasty
figs
plums
raisins
slight
licorice
and
caramel
a
true
delight
to
drink
the
alcohol
is
hidden
very
well
full
body
a
complex
brew
very
drinkable
this
is
another
gem
from
allagash
highly
recommended
pours
a
beautiful
ruby
red
color
wit
hardly
any
head
whatsoever
the
smell
is
very
fruity
and
yeasty
i
can
smell
the
alcohol
aswell
taste
is
full
of
flavor
lots
of
fruity
flavors
from
apples
to
citrus
to
yeast
the
alcohol
is
present
but
not
overpowering
it
has
hardly
any
carbonation
another
good
quad
overall
quite
a
tasty
beer
but
definitely
not
what
i
think
of
when
i
think
of
a
belgian
quad
id
definitely
buy
it
and
it
is
well
worth
trying
but
dont
expect
the
deep
dark
fruits
and
layers
of
caramelization
found
in
other
quads
if
the
alcohol
was
a
bit
more
hidden
and
the
darker
side
of
the
beer
was
bumped
up
i
probably
would
have
rated
it
higher
either
way
give
it
a
shot
its
a
solid
beer
from
a
great
brewery
thanks
again

fizzy
inch
thick
offwhite

settles
to
a
thin

after
a
few
minutes
nice
beading
lacing
some
sticking
a
swirl
brings
back
the

very
nice
the
aroma
has
a
very
complex
yeasty
quality
but
actually
a
bit
timid
no
refined
well
call
it
with
faint
spices
a
dry
sweet
malty
and
fruity
nose
the
taste
full
of
fruits
complex
sugars
and
spicy
yeasts
much
similar
to
the
nose
but
also
some
darker
stuff
brown
sugar
is
present
here
some
rich
caramels
plums
and
figs
and
raisins
figure
in
the
alcohol
becoming
more
and
more
apparent
as
it
warms
the
body
is
above
medium
but
should
be
a
bit
bigger
is
fairly
smooth
and
warm
not
the
best
part
but
not
subtracting
from
it
overall
the
idea
four
malts
sugars
yeasts
and
hops
fermented
four
times
is
very
cool
and
works
well
here
as
with
any
good
beer
it
got
better
as
it
warmed
in
all
im
happy
with
it
ohmygodd
despite
a
10
abv
this
is
an
extremely
drinkable
beer
enjoyable
to
the
last
drop
not
too
light
or
heavy
ridiculously
flavorful
looks
and
feels
amazing
would
be
great
at
a
beer
bar
with
friends
as
accompaniment
to
a
cookout
or
just
by
yourself
in
a
contemplative
restful
mood
cant
remember
what
i
paid
for
it
and
i
dont
care
ill
pay
whatever
theyre
asking
to
get
more
fantastic
d
at
10
this
is
not
a
quaffing
beer
i
had
one
glass
and
savored
every
sip
but
doubt
that
i
could
handle
a
second
the
taste
was
a
bit
acrid
for
a
quad
almost
as
if
it
had
been
oaked
in
one
of
its
four
fermentations
cherry
apple
toffee
and
vanilla
abounded
as
well
as
a
domineering
alcohol
note
mouthfeel
was
thick
bodied
and
overly
carbonated
the
aftertaste
brought
little
to
the
table
it
was
bitter
but
not
overly
so
drinkability
was
limited
despite
the
complexity
as
this
beer
packed
a
whopping
price
tag
to
match
its
enormous
abv
it
reminded
me
of
a
standard
quad
a
good
one
at
first
then
as
it
warmed
up
a
bit
more
in
the
glass
it
got
even
better
i
dont
know
why
it
was
fermented
so
many
times
i
though
it
was
good
but
not
great
compared
to
other
quads
that
i
have
tried
i
would
drink
this
beer
again
anyday
but
it
was
not
worth
the
13
dollars
i
spent
on
it
d
this
beer
is
sweet
with
a
fruity
quality
to
the
malt
which
is
nice
and
the
alcohol
helps
to
support
the
malt
nicely
this
makes
a
nice
desert
beer
but
i
cant
say
i
could
pick
out
the
4
malts
and
4
yeast
qualities
it
didnt
have
that
much
depth
for
all
the
4s
d
extremely
good
a
pleasant
beer
from
first
drop
to
last
comments

i
am
a
fan
of
the
excellent
brewery
that
spawned
this
fine
beer
i
gladly
pay
a
premium
so
i
can
enjoy
the
consistent
quality
that
each
beer
from
maine
exhibits
the
four
was
no
exception
ill
continue
to
reach
for
it
whenever
it
presents
itself
this
far
way
from
home
recommended
d
rather
relaxed
flavors
but
all
showing
through
making
for
an
easy
drinkability
and
fairly
unique
composition
pours
a
clear
dark
orange
amber
with
a
smallish
tan
foamy
head
the
smell
is
strong
with
alcoholsweet
maltoak
wooddark
fruitand
vanila
a
very
good
and
complex
aroma
the
taste
is
like
the
smell
full
of
dark
fruitoak
woodbourbanhoneyand
citrus
hops
an
exceptionally
tasting
beer
that
should
not
be
missed
the
mf
is
heavy
with
all
the
complex
flavors
mixing
very
well
an
outstanding
beer
from
one
of
the
great
brewerys
in
america
four
may
not
be
the
stunningly
beautiful
beer
that
most
of
allagashs
lineup
is
but
its
damn
close
its
also
a
wonderful
version
of
a
style
that
i
love
more
each
time
i
drink
it
even
though
these
allagash
750s
can
be
expensive
i
wont
hesitate
to
grab
another
bottle
the
next
time
i
see
it
highly
recommended
well
i
have
had
better
and
i
seriously
doubt
that
i
will
bother
trying
to
sample
this
again
well
of
course
as
a
quad
no
matter
how
good
it
is
youve
got
to
sip
it
slow
or
your
on
the
floor
the
fact
is
this
is
a
fantastic
quad
exceptionally
smooth
and
very
drinkable
pours
a
cloudy
dark
amber
color
not
unlike
a
good
cider
no
head
or
lacing
the
smell
is
all
about
the
alcohol
past
that
primarily
a
yeasty
dark
fruity
aroma
full
bodied
the
mouth
feel
is
immediately
conditioned
by
the
alcohol
slightly
undercarbonated
flavor
is
sweet
with
brown
sugar
apples
and
pears
the
10
abv
is
fully
showcased
in
the
smell
mouth
feel
and
can
be
felt
every
inch
of
the
way
down
beautiful
looking
brew
deep
amber
with
a
few
inches
of
offwhite
head
that
subsides
quickly
the
aroma
is
of
belgian
yeast
fruits
and
malts
you
really
gotta
put
your
nose
in
the
glass
to
pick
up
much
though
im
more
impressed
with
the
taste
many
times
ive
been
disappointed
by
highly
regarded
brews
of
this
style
i
really
like
this
one
though
the
flavors
are
bright
and
alive
very
active
carbonation
on
the
tongue
its
got
a
satisfying
bite
as
you
swallow
the
alcohol
melds
well
with
its
surrounding
influences
while
malt
driven
you
can
still
pick
out
some
of
the
hop
characteristics
such
as
citrus
fruit
and
a
touch
of
bitterness
im
not
yet
proficient
at
picking
out
individual
flavors
in
belgian
style
beers
in
particular
but
i
do
know
what
i
like
this
is
very
good
and
i
will
be
picking
up
a
few
more
bottles
so
i
can
see
what
happens
over
the
course
of
a
few
years
wow
its
a
pricey
treat
i
wasnt
disappointed
fantastic
complexity
the
sweetness
wasnt
overpowering
and
the
high
alcohol
content
was
well
hidden
an
incredibly
drinkable
beer
for
its
potency
every
sip
and
sniff
had
a
different
flavor
or
nuance
to
follow
overall
a
great
bear
from
a
brewery
that
never
ceases
to
surprise
from
a
750ml
bottle
beer
poured
a
clear
brownish
red
with
little
head
aroma
was
a
light
grape
fruity
smell
taste
was
a
grapes
over
a
malt
background
with
some
spice
not
too
heavy
for
a
beer
like
this
somewhat
slick
but
light
for
the
style
overall
i
didnt
enjoy
this
that
much
it
was
a
lighter
bodied
maltyalcoholy
brew
but
not
that
interesting
wasnt
as
deep
and
rich
as
other
quadrupels
ive
tried
definetely
a
smooth
and
full
mouthfeel
with
a
boatload
of
pleasant
warming
alcohol
there
is
nothing
bad
about
this
beer
its
all
good
good
indeed
pleasantly
thick
mouthfeel
as
it
first
touches
the
palate
not
thick
as
in
heavy
but
thick
as
coating
sugary
sweetness
is
almost
too
annoying
at
first
maltyness
is
bigger
then
i
would
have
expected
and
lingers
well
into
the
aftertaste
belgian
yeast
flavors
are
coupled
with
the
malt
notes
adding
to
the
overall
body
of
the
beer
dark
fruit
notes
are
present
but
play
a
supporting
role
to
the
caramel
malt
and
slight
belgian
notes
smooth
and
quite
drinkable
a
nice
one
to
get
a
hold
of
if
you
can
drinkability
at
any
rate
its
another
pleasant
likeable
release
from
allagash
that
should
be
drank
accordingly
md
light
bodied
and
dry
feeling
bubbly
as
a
wine
on
the
tongue
but
easily
drinkable
to
high
of
an
abv
to
do
more
than
a
glass
at
a
time
definitely
a
sharing
bottle
but
worth
it
a
decent
brew
d
i
think
it
is
a
great
quad
i
think
st
bernys
12
is
better
though
and
especially
for
the
price
difference
good
beer
but
you
can
get
better
for
a
lot
cheaper
its
a
nice
deep
brown
copper
color
with
a
super
dense
head
that
casually
fades
leaving
exceptional
lacing
the
nose
is
sugary
sweet
malts
with
some
yeast
and
roasty
goodness
taste
is
nice
deep
sweetness
with
hints
of
dark
fruit
raisins
yeast
touches
of
honey
and
the
slightest
bit
of
alcohol
on
the
finish
very
nice
mouthfeel
is
dense
smooth
and
creamy
much
better
than
some
other
quads
drinkability
is
dangerous
for
a
10
great
overall
had
a
bottle
at
najas
in
redondo
beach
im
not
sure
how
old
the
beer
was
probably
2
yrs
old
there
was
hardly
any
head
at
all
no
matter
how
hard
i
poured
seems
like
it
lost
some
of
its
carbonation
along
the
way
the
color
was
murky
and
hazy
orange
with
floating
yeastie
particles
the
aroma
and
taste
were
mostly
fruity
esters
and
alcohol
probably
more
alcohol
in
the
flavor
than
i
expected
overall
it
was
an
ok
quad
not
my
favorite
but
possibly
not
aged
very
well
d
this
might
be
a
good
goto
beer
during
the
summer
for
me
this
beer
is
actually
quite
refreshing
and
would
work
nicely
on
a
summer
afternoon
if
you
prefer
darker
beers
as
i
do
750
ml
bottle
color
of
mahogany
with
a
healthy
tan
head
nose
of
dark
red
fruit
molasses
ginger
snaps
the
cookie
slight
coffee
grindings
and
alcohol

taste
of
dark
red
fruit
candied
quality
chocolate
sharp
and
something
else
body
is
sharp
at
first
then
creamy
the
sharp
again
and
with
high
carbonation

aftertaste
of
brown
sugar
pumpkin
and
sharp

good
but
i
am
not
sure
if
it
is
worth
the
price
overall
i
enjoyed
this
american
interpretation
of
a
quad
and
will
not
hesitate
to
buy
it
again
it
is
a
bit
coarse
and
unrefined
when
compared
to
some
of
its
belgian
counterparts
but
it
is
a
very
nice
beer
that
i
look
forward
to
enjoying
whenever
i
can
it
is
hard
to
find
in
ohio
i
got
mine
during
a
visit
to
chicago
a
better
head
and
a
little
more
complexity
in
the
flavor
profile
would
make
this
a
world
class
beer
cheers
this
one
was
a
disappointment
for
me
maybe
this
one
was
infected
or
something
as
the
green
apple
character
just
didnt
sit
well
too
caramelish
for
style
esp
as
there
are
three
other
malts
in
the
mix
it
might
need
to
age
more
also
as
the
alcohol
was
just
a
bit
too
masking
22
oz
bottle
poured
in
my
pint
glass
with
heroes
david
bowie
on
the
hifi
the
guitar
of
robert
fripp
on
this
track
is
magnificent
hopefully
this
brew
from
allagash
with
be
the
same
bottle
is
capped
caged
and
corked
with
luminous
lettering
on
the
bottle
when
poured
it
has
a
beautiful
frothy
cream
colored
head
burnt
amber
color
and
beaming
aroma
abound
first
taste
is
scrumptious
and
flavorful
the
aroma
of
honey
fig
honey
is
also
what
i
taste
with
a
tad
bit
of
booze
burn
which
is
wonderful
halfway
through
my
pint
there
is
plenty
of
lacing
and
a
thin
head
this
is
another
great
brew
by
allagash
in
my
book
splendid
a
little
thin
on
the
mouth
but
still
overall
a
very
nice
brew
750ml
bottle
this
one
pours
a
hazy
coppery
coor
there
was
a
small
offwhite
head
that
doesnt
last
too
long
the
aroma
is
quite
nice
a
myriad
of
different
scents
bready
caramel
coriander
pears
apples
and
possibly
a
few
others
the
taste
is
quite
good
although
it
a
tad
lighter
in
body
than
i
would
have
expected
light
carbonation
on
the
tongue
tastes
of
caramel
but
not
very
sweet
at
all
spices
fruits
it
is
complex
to
say
the
least
very
nicely
done
d
excellent
one
of
the
best
quadrupels
interpretations
particularly
made
in
us
ive
had
would
be
very
happy
to
pick
up
a
few
of
these
despite
the
high
price
i
paid
out
on
the
west
coast
for
a
bomber
caramel
and
malt
with
essence
of
honey
and
fruit
pits
are
apparent
on
the
nose
and
the
palate
there
is
a
resinous
quality
to
the
mouthfeel
but
it
is
quite
pleasant
very
warming
feel
from
the
high
abv
but
also
to
be
expected
im
glad
i
tried
this
it
is
one
of
my
preferred
allagash
offerings
d
quite
good
the
cork
popped
off
the
750
ml
bottle
with
a
rather
unsatisfying
thump
i
was
expecting
the
loud
pop
that
usually
accompanies
corked
belgian
style
ales
the
beer
had
a
murky
brown
appearance
with
almost
no
head
and
very
little
carbonation
aroma
was
good
candyish
malts
spices
clove
and
pepper
and
yeasty
bread
aromas
in
the
nose
taste
was
equally
good
ripe
fruit
spices
and
a
hint
of
hops
along
with
warming
alcohol
mouhfeel
was
a
little
thin
however
due
to
the
beer
being
almost
flat
not
sure
what
happened
here
but
im
disappointed
that
i
spent
11
bucks
on
this
beer
i
probably
got
a
bad
bottle
so
maybe
i
need
to
purchase
one
at
another
store
in
order
to
give
this
brew
a
fair
shake
a
fairly
spicy
and
bitter
quad
that
is
definitely
an
outlier
from
its
quad
brethren
and
i
might
add
in
keeping
with
belgian
nosethumbing
at
conformity
to
rigid
style
categories
there
is
great
complexity
here
and
an
almost
pale
ale
feelalthough
the
high
abv
and
substantial
bitterness
quickly
shatter
that
illusion
and
bring
you
back
home
to
quadville
theres
no
hiding
that
this
is
a
quad
nor
that
its
a
domestic
however
as
a
simple
expression
of
strong
dark
ales
this
brew
suceeds
admirably
a
little
meatier
than
its
belgian
cousins
this
maltbomb
is
pleasing
for
the
soul
if
nothing
else
the
body
is
substantial
and
a
bit
creamy
but
lacks
the
carbonation
that
truly
wonderful
belgian
quads
possess
on
the
whole
though
an
excellent
offering
from
allagash
one
that
i
could
see
myself
drinking
a
lot
of
this
one
has
been
sittin
in
my
beer
fridge
for
way
too
long
but
what
a
beer
to
wait
for
this
brew
is
much
better
than
many
other
quads
i
have
tried
heavy
sweet
malts
blended
well
and
matured
into
a
fruitcakesweet
brew
with
hints
of
nuts
and
rum
a
mild
plastic
aroma
that
shows
early
disipated
quickly
into
a
unique
belgian
fermented
note
tastes
confirm
all
the
fruits
and
yeast
while
adding
a
confectionate
sugar
sweetness
along
with
belgian
spiciness
the
beer
continues
with
a
warming
and
numbing
effect
but
never
getting
fusal
or
harsh
lots
of
sweet
alcohols
nearly
hurt
the
teeth
kinda
samichlauslike
finishes
with
a
continuing
warmth
mild
grain
sugar
bite
and
lingering
sweetness
a
sip
here
will
go
a
long
way
nice
brew
d
chewy
creamy
body
alcohol
is
not
too
big
and
it
doesnt
dry
up
too
much
carbonation
is
balanced
very
nicely
as
well
taste
is
raisiny
and
slightly
bitter
on
the
finish
mouthfeel
is
silky
smooth
with
a
wonderful
body
and
plenty
of
carbonation
this
beer
is
quite
a
treat
and
works
well
on
thanksgiving
even
at
10
i
could
see
myself
working
down
a
bottle
of
this
to
myself
no
problem
however
in
the
spirit
of
good
brew
im
sharing
this
one
with
family
today
overall
another
fine
brew
from
allagash
that
has
aged
quite
nicely
a
good
latenight
beer
just
before
bed
as
im
having
right
now
drinkabilityoverall
liquid
boozy
caramel
apple
tons
of
apple
skin
tannins
not
awful
but
could
use
some
malty
balance
as
this
comes
of
quite
dry
and
alcoholic
poured
into
chimay
chalice
a
nice
musty
reddish
amber
the
head
dissipates
at
medium
speed
and
lingers
on
surface
its
sustained
by
tiny
bubbles
and
leaves
little
lacing
at
first
sniff
smells
almost
like
that
strawberry
nesquick
predominately
sweet
malts
with
minimal
yet
supportive
hop
character
there
are
hints
of
strawberry
vanilla
light
fruity
esters
and
maybe
even
minor
touches
of
berry
and
apple
if
the
smell
doesnt
get
you
the
flavor
will
the
flavor
is
excellent
enticing
and
welcoming
the
sweet
malts
are
balanced
masterfully
with
just
the
right
amount
of
hoppy
bitterness
the
spectacular
malts
are
definitely
the
showcase
of
this
beer
along
with
their
excellent
fruity
esters
i
could
drink
this
stuff
like
crazy
if
it
wasnt
10
abv
which
is
hidden
ridiculously
well
how
ever
to
most
this
beer
does
not
have
the
marks
of
what
youd
look
for
in
a
killer
quad
lacking
body
head
and
what
have
you
but
i
still
find
it
to
be
a
fun
version
of
a
one
some
of
the
sents
and
flavors
might
at
moments
seem
synthetic
which
i
acknowledge
but
for
me
they
turn
out
in
a
tasty
way
that
works
well
i
mean
this
beer
even
has
great
quenching
capability
but
to
quench
your
thirst
with
this
is
to
feel
its
strength
every
thing
about
this
beer
screams
drink
me
and
then
buy
another
bottle
so
you
can
show
your
friends
but
drink
me
this
is
a
fabulous
beer
and
a
great
concept
there
is
no
question
i
will
buy
this
again
750ml

a
solid

unique
interesting
drinkable
for
the
style
and
overall
a
very
wellcrafted
beer
awesome
drinkability
a
little
too
thin
of
a
body
but
the
flavor
is
definitely
interesting
not
the
ebst
from
the
style
but
above
average
cheers2beers
the
mouth
feel
is
perfect
for
style
as
it
is
a
sweet
beer
the
presentation
of
this
beer
as
well
as
the
leadup
on
the
bottle
really
put
the
stakes
high
and
unfortunately
they
prove
to
be
too
high
pours
with
a
dark
redgolden
color
with
no
head
smell
is
tremendous
with
lots
of
sugars
and
dense
malts
with
the
taste
i
was
expecting
the
kind
of
beer
thats
almost
hard
to
drink
because
of
the
complexity
but
the
amount
of
flavor
doesnt
seem
to
be
as
big
as
the
sum
of
its
parts
the
most
discernable
taste
that
really
sums
up
the
beer
is
of
candied
fruits
most
likely
coming
from
the
grains
a
great
beer
but
i
dont
think
it
lives
up
to
the
high
reputation
of
what
youd
expect
from
such
a
special
beer
from
allagash
very
complex
and
flavorful
the
higher
abv
limits
the
drinkability
for
me
still
a
well
done
quad
poured
a
semitranslucent
bubblelaiden
medium
brown
color
with
burgundy
highlights
a
frothy
white
head
develops
and
quickly
dissipates
leaving
behind
plenty
of
lacing
aromas
of
plums
figs
earth
grains
and
dried
fruits
seemed
to
come
out
the
taste
was
filled
with
earthy
flavors
like
ripe
dark
fruits
and
grains
the
dominating
sweetness
was
offset
by
a
subtle
and
yet
sufficient
bitterness
layers
of
flavors
seemed
to
jump
out
of
this
beer
somewhat
creamy
and
slick
in
my
mouth
very
easy
to
sip
and
enjoy
i
could
hardly
taste
the
high
abv
in
this
beer
very
complex
and
an
excellent
beer
i
hope
to
have
again
soon
nice
dark
red
color
with
a
white
head
leaving
some
lacing
ive
seen
plenty
of
others
out
perform
this
one
but
it
still
looks
nice
yeast
candi
sugar
and
dark
fruits
with
a
bit
of
an
alcohol
sting
in
the
nose
yeast
is
the
first
thing
you
taste
but
followed
quickly
by
the
fruits
and
then
an
alcohol
warmth
alcohol
is
not
hidden
but
not
overpowering
taste
seems
to
become
a
bit
cloyingly
sweet
after
a
while
lower
carbonation
medium
bodied
pretty
good
on
occasion
its
great
if
i
have
extra
money
next
time
i
will
pick
this
up
but
its
notihng
more
special
than
that
drinkablity
this
is
a
decent
but
not
great
beer
also
high
abv
of
10
limits
this
to
one
750
in
any
given
session
a
brownish
copper
colored
beer
with
a
slight
haze
has
a
nice
small
bubbled
foamy
head
and
a
little
bit
of
lace
at
first
the
aroma
has
an
appley
tartness
followed
by
a
hint
of
dried
fruit
and
a
smooth
caramel
malt
note
the
flavor
starts
out
with
a
sharp
tart
note
which
changes
quickly
to
a
light
sweet
dried
fruit
character
the
middle
is
just
a
smooth
luxurious
maltiness
the
finish
has
the
hops
adding
as
much
to
the
overall
flavor
as
to
the
nice
little
snap
at
the
back
of
the
throat
the
body
is
a
little
less
than
i
was
anticipating
but
it
has
a
very
nice
and
smooth
carbonation
drinkability
is
good
but
could
be
better
another
great
beer
from
allagash
jen
this
is
a
very
smooth
beer
it
has
a
nice
dried
fruit
taste
to
it
typical
of
a
belgian
ale
but
it
isnt
sicky
sweet
i
also
get
a
nice
mild
maltness
to
it
that
is
accompanied
by
a
nice
yeasty
taste
nothing
too
overwhelming
and
easy
on
your
palette
with
a
very
mild
alcohol
twinge
at
the
end
very
bold
with
the
fruit
and
spices
maltiness
is
interesting
this
is
a
complex
and
enjoyable
brew
mouthfeel
pretty
efervescant
granted
you
can
t
see
a
lot
of
carbonation
but
you
can
feel
a
lot
of
it
on
the
middle
sides
of
the
tongue
overall
alcohol
has
mellowed
out
i
can
definitely
feel
it
but
not
really
taste
it
there
is
a
lot
going
on
in
this
beer
its
no
westvleteren
or
rochefort
but
its
not
bad
the
thing
that
hurt
this
beer
was
the
balance
and
it
definitely
has
this
slight
sourtartness
in
the
overall
taste
i
wonder
if
the
cork
went
bad
or
something
its
also
really
spicy
it
could
be
from
the
alcohol
but
not
sure
the
aroma
is
outstanding
though
d
i
would
have
given
this
a
5
if
it
wasnt
so
spendy
per
bottle
but
overall
the
best
quadruple
i
have
tried
to
date
amazingly
complex
well
worth
what
i
paid
now
to
finish
this
bottle
and
tomorrow
try
and
track
down
another
dark
cloudy
orangebrown
with
a
medium
head
that
falls
to
a
continent
and
a
high
ring
no
lace
nose
spicy
not
a
lot
of
depth
but
nothing
unpleasant
some
what
is
it
melon
notes
smooth
caramel
spice
and
alcohol
flavors
kick
in
creamy
mouthfeel
but
falls
apart
before
the
finish
there
is
nothing
overpowering
here
a
fine
beer
and
a
great
drinker

lithographed
winelike
bottle
corked
and
caged
d
well
the
name
says
it
all
and
coincides
with
my
ratings
across
the
board
this
is
without
a
doubt
easy
to
drink
and
although
it
is
solid
across
the
board
it
falls
just
short
of
true
greatness
after
a
long
day
of
work
i
wanted
to
open
up
one
of
my
big
beers
so
here
wwe
go

color
smells
a
bit
like

taste
is
sweet

cherry
a
bit
winey
very
sweet
winey
flavor
nice
mouthfeel
for
this
beer
overall
its
pretty
good
maybe
my
palate
is
wanting
real
hoppy
beers
for
the
time
being
but
i
cant
say
that
this
is
bad
far
from
it
if
you
want
a
good
belgian
style
folks
this
is
it
best
of
all
its
from
maine
ive
thoroughly
enjoyed
every
beer
ive
had
from
allagash
and
this
is
no
exception
it
was
a
pretty
red
color
with
a
medium
white
head
it
had
a
nice
roasted
grain
odor
with
some
sweetness
the
taste
was
sweet
caramel
mildly
hoppy
the
sweetnessfruitiness
lingered
very
smooth
and
drinkable
not
heavy
the
alcohol
is
welldisguised
bottle
poured
a
clear
amber
color
ale
with
a
huge
beige
foamy
head
with
excellent
retention
aroma
of
sweet
malt
cookie
dough
with
some
alcohol
hint
is
pretty
interesting
but
i
could
have
done
without
the
alcohol
hint
taste
is
a
bit
sweeter
then
expected
with
lots
of
cookie
dough
and
some
dry
raisins
i
would
have
loved
for
this
beer
to
have
more
attenuated
sugars
and
a
fruitier
aroma

i
cant
really
have
an
abt
without
comparing
it
to
the
best
body
is
above
average
but
could
have
been
more
full
and
alcohol
could
be
more
hidden
very
interesting
beer
from
allagash
but
cannot
honestly
say
that
it
compared
to
the
world
bests
opinion
this
is
one
rich
muthuh
if
the
belgians
had
a
barley
wine
this
would
be
it
it
reminds
me
of
a
slightly
less
hoppy
version
of
hair
of
the
dogs
fred
i
didnt
think
that
i
would
ever
try
anything
like
that
beer
until
now
the
alcohol
is
a
bit
distracting
for
me
and
is
not
hidden
at
all
you
know
damn
well
that
this
is
a
strong
beer
from
the
first
sniff
in
fact
i
would
think
that
it
was
higher
in
the
12abv
mark
brown
creamy
color
nice
medium
head
poured
in
a
frosty
mug
great
citrus
flavor
that
tantalized
our
nariz
like
no
other
smooth
citrus
flavor
nice
hop
blend
and
a
little
sweet
finish
the
finish
might
be
the
best
part
as
i
cashed
the
brew
and
sat
contemplating
the
sweet
citrus
hoppy
aftertaste
fantastic
give
it
a
try
if
you
have
the
thumb
strength
to
pop
the
top
id
definitely
recommend
it
i
am
a
big
beer
guy
and
this
one
will
make
my
belly
warm
and
enjoy
the
cold
evening
however
itd
even
make
a
nice
sharing
brew
in
the
summer
if
chilled
interesting
brew
this
is
a
nice
medium
bodied
quadrupple
wonderful
flavor
caramel
candi
sugar
citrus
banana
oak
vanilla
the
taste
swirls
around
the
mouth
and
makes
you
want
to
come
back
for
more
this
beer
is
lightly
sweet
not
cloying
or
syrupy
in
any
way
my
next
trip
up
to
portland
me
will
conclude
with
a
case
or
two
of
this
coming
home
with
me
for
the
beer
cellar
to
enjoy
for
quite
some
time
highly
recommended
deep
rusty
brown
tons
of
fine
yeast
sediment
sits
at
the
bottom
like
sand
aroma
is
belgian
yeast
and
fruity
overtones
with
an
alcoholic
punch
the
taste
is
quite
fruity
citrusy
orange
peel
lemon
with
the
spices
coming
on
more
thick
and
the
alcohol
creating
a
strong
warming
effect
the
belgian
malts
and
yeast
really
add
to
the
flavor
but
the
hops
are
fairly
subtle
despite
the
supposed
four
varieties
the
mouthfeel
is
somewhat
grainy
but
the
rich
flavors
keep
you
yearning
for
more
not
a
bad
interpretation
of
the
rare
style
but
its
hard
to
truly
appreciate
this
when
im
lucky
enough
to
have
one
of
the
best
st
bernardus
12
ontap
a
few
blocks
down
the
street
however
this
one
is
worth
a
try
for
sure
taste
is
raisiny
and
slightly
bitter
on
the
finish
sweet
scotch
or
rum
up
front
thanks
beerbeing
the
verdict
why
not
just
buy
a
korbinian
cheaper
same
basic
flavour
profile
but
better
not
a
bad
beer
by
any
means
but
it
comes
so
close
to
true
greatness
that
it
invites
comparison
but
far
enough
away
to
lose
that
particular
competition
i
remain
curious
about
quads
but
so
far
would
rather
grab
a
dopplebock
i
dig
this
even
at
10
its
easy
to
drink
for
some
reason
i
was
expecting
mediocrity
here
but
that
expectation
proved
unreliable
cause
thats
a
good
beer
another
outstanding
beer
from
allagash
rapidly
becoming
one
of
my
fav
brewers
ive
been
holding
onto
a
bunch
of
these
for
months
i
just
couldnt
bring
my
self
to
open
open
if
i
drink
one
ill
only
have
5
left
finally
broke
down
and
drank
one
for
thanksgiving
eve
had
to
rationalize
it
anyway
aroma
was
great
even
though
there
are
four
malts
in
this
i
really
didnt
notice
it
or
the
hops
what
i
really
noticed
was
the
cherry
and
ruby
port
head
was
creamy
lightbrown
excellent
lacing
that
mostly
diminished
color
was
dark
amber
heavy
sweet
initial
flavor
that
lessens
definitely
can
taste
the
malt
now
finish
was
very
long
the
body
was
not
as
full
as
some
quads
texture
was
syrupy
and
flat
with
incredibly
little
if
any
alcohol
finish
one
of
my
favorite
quads
it
was
very
smooth
without
too
much
cherry
like
three
phils
very
interested
to
see
how
this
matures
now
only
if
allagash
would
distribute
to
georgia
the
body
was
a
little
delicate
for
the
style
but
the
sticky
mouthfeel
was
enough
to
allow
the
flavors
to
shine
through
the
maturity
of
the
flavors
concealed
the
sugar
derived
alcohols
quite
well
made
a
perfect
nightcap
especially
when
paired
with
a
wedge
of
semisoft
brie
cheese
the
only
slight
downside
to
the
whole
experience
was
the
fact
that
the
taste
did
not
change
very
much
during
the
consumption
of
the
entire
750
ml
bomber
despite
that
a
very
pleasing
beer
drinkability
and
overall
yet
another
quality
allagash
product
i
feel
like
this
brewery
just
doesnt
miss
its
balance
and
complexity
keep
me
sippin
and
enjoying
a
very
very
nice
american
quad
allagash
four
pours
a
thick
opaque
caramel
coloryou
could
dip
apples
in
this
shit
actually
it
smells
sort
of
like
apples
good
autumn
beer
then
you
can
smell
the
10
alcohol
a
bit
tastes
very
malty
upfront
crisply
of
apples
with
some
spicy
alcohol
and
hops
in
the
finish
has
an
unpleasant
rotten
apple
aftertaste
im
a
fan
of
allagashs
other
beers
but
fouractually
the
quadrupel
style
in
generalis
just
too
malty
and
sweet
for
me
to
really
get
into
what
i
especially
missed
in
this
beer
was
the
trademark
allagash
spices
that
made
their
grand
cru
such
a
treat
for
me
overall
this
was
a
terrific
beer
and
a
real
pleasent
sipper
and
something
to
be
shared
or
horded
depending
on
company
d
an
excellent
beer
to
relax
and
sip
as
i
will
tonight
as
i
get
ready
for
and
watch
the
season
finale
of
rescue
me
i
sure
hope
allagash
makes
this
again
thanks
for
babysitting
this
for
me

fermented
note
that
i
only
list
the
negatives
because
i
rank
this
beer
as
outstanding
just
a
few
flaws
in
my
opinion
props
to
mdavis31481
and
warrior
soul
you
both
sent
me

i
dont
know
whose
im

edit
i
just
realized
my
review
equalled
4
thats
some
funny
sht
drinkability
overall
a
very
nice
brew
to
be
shared
for
an
after
dinner
drink
not
meant
to
have
the
whole
bomber
in
one
sitting
if
there
was
a
bit
more
sweetness
there
it
would
have
tied
the
whole
experience
of
the
beer
together
that
bit
of
sweetness
missing
cost
the
beer
at
least
a
12
a
point
overall
in
rating
still
a
nice
beer
but
nothing
absolutely
incredible
like
i
was
hoping
for
mouthfeel
carbonation
lively
but
not
over
the
top
well
balanced
and
soothing
medium
body
but
still
has
soft
quality
of
texture
deep
burnt
orange
colour
hazy
with
a
generous
offwhite
head
that
showed
good
retention
and
lacing
aromas
of
malt
and
fruit
dominated
mostly
pear
but
with
a
bit
of
apple
as
well
theres
also
a
light
alcohol
smell
that
increases
as
it
warms
but
the
maltiness
balances
it
out
nicely
spiciness
melds
well
with
the
other
aromas
and
carries
into
the
flavour
the
fruitiness
is
more
subdued
in
the
flavour
with
malt
coming
more
to
the
forefront
the
balance
leans
toward
sweetness
but
there
is
still
noticeable
bitterness
alcohol
contributes
a
warming
sensation
with
little
flavour
the
finish
is
on
the
dry
side
with
some
hop
bitterness
and
peppery
spice
lowish
carbonation
and
a
moderately
full
body
overall
nicely
balanced
and
quite
enjoyable
and
a
little
surprising
how
easy
it
was
to
drink
even
with
the
big
flavours
and
high
abv
thanks
viggo
drinkability
wonderful
and
well
balanced
all
around
this
is
a
well
made
beer
and
a
nice
limited
edition
this
is
yet
another
beer
that
the
folks
at
allagash
can
be
very
proud
of
mostly
clear
garnet
in
color
with
a
thin
wispy
tan
head
rich
malty
aroma
with
a
character
of
nuts
and
dark
fruit
alcohol
emerges
as
the
beer
warms
more
nutty
maltiness
in
the
flavor
with
a
pleasantly
alcoholic
taste
of
cherry
in
the
midpalate
finish
is
tingly
and
bitter
spicy
and
warming
nice
brew
nice
frothy

with
a
springy
clover
aspect
as
well
warming
malt
on
the
tongue
along
with
some
raisiny
aspects
maybe
golden
and
a
cooling
alcohol
aftertaste
somewhat
soapy
mouthfeel
but
a
quality
offering
all
the
same
pours
a
medium
brown
with
some
reddish
tint
with
a
nice
two
finger
slightly
off
white
head
that
leaves
a
generous
amount
of
lace
as
it
settles
aromas
of
cherry
and
brown
sugar
are
dominant
and
fresh
with
a
light
iron
character
to
it
as
well
taste
is
spicey

clovey
with
some
cherry

750ml
bottle
poured
into
a

glass
it
pours
a
murky
brownish
red
color
with
four
fingers
of
head
coincidence
with
this
beer
there
is
a
bit
of
lacing
on
the
glass
the
smell
is
very
rich
and

lots
of
brown
sugar
and
dark

nice
and

the
taste
is
fairly
sweet
super
malty
with
lots
of
plums
and
dates
it
finishes
slightly
dry
though
with
a
hint
of
alcohol
the
mouthfeel
is
decently
thick
and
strong
and
the
drinkability
is
surprising
for
10
a
decent
take
at
a
quad
another
killer
from
allagash
really
high
end
stuff
from
the
guys
up
in
maine
nice
light
brown
color
with
ruby
highlights
and
a
pretty
decent
foamy
head
that
lasts
smell
and
taste
are
very
complex
i
like
complex
really
fruity
really
sweet
this
is
one
of
those
beers
where
if
you
try
to
smell
it
you
will
smell
it
and
taste
it
too
basically
choose
your
own
adventure
what
i
mean
by
that
is
that
if
youre
thinking
of
cherries
youll
taste
it
in
the
beer
if
youre
thinking
about
pears
youll
taste
it
in
the
beer
etc
the
schnozzberries
taste
like
schnozzberries
for
christs
sake
super
smooth
mouthfeel
and
despite
the
10
this
is
a
really
drinkble
quad
bueno
a
hazy
crimsonaccented
chestnut
robe
is
capped
by
a
creamy
dark
ivory
head
that
holds
well
given
its
strength
before
dropping
to
a
wide
collar
and
leaves
rings
of
craggy
lace
about
the
goblet
the
nose
is
typically
belgian
in
nature
with
its
yeasty
phenols
fruit
and
spice
dominating
over
its
lightly
sugarish
delicately
caramelish
and
somewhat
nutty
maltiness
alcohol
can
also
be
found
but
its
not
obtrusive
the
body
is
mediumlight
and
its
zesty
on
the
palate
initially
with
a
very
finebubbled
natural
carbonation
however
it
becomes
a
bit
more
airy
as
it
warms
as
is
common
in
the
flavor
the
alcohol
is
a
little
bit
more
apparent
theres
a
touch
of
bubblegum
to
the
phenols
and
the
maltiness
has
more
of
a
brown
sugar
character
to
it
but
its
basically
what
the
nose
suggests
it
should
be
the
yeastiness
is
very
much
like
chimay
and
to
be
honest
this
is
very
much
like
a
more
attenuated
version
of
their
grande
reserve
it
finishes
dry
with
a
slap
of
spicy
alcohol
and
yeasty
phenols
but
not
much
more
a
bit
more
residual
malt
might
be
nice
but
i
understand
thats
a
hard
beast
to
control
when
it
comes
to
bottleconditioned
beers
try
it
and
see
what
you
think
this
is
a
potent
brew
with
tremendous
amount
of
flavor
and
complexity
there
are
elements
of
dryness
and
sweetness
richness
and
carbonationa
very
interesting
beer
worth
a
try
but
dont
kill
yourself

it

still
mostly
full

up
to
a

pretty
shadows
were
cast
against
the

stubborn

the

of
brown

the
flavor
kind
of
wraps
around
the

malty

sweet

with
a
nice

kick
4
hops
were
used
i
can
see
that
but
none
particularly
jump
out
also
tones
of
citrus
nutmeg
vanilla
and
coriander
come
through
the
mouthfeel
was
a
little
heavy
i
wonder
if
it
would
change
if
it
was
cold
there
is
only
a
slight
taste
of
alcohol
but
nothing
that
takes
away
from
the
drinkability
i
like
this
beer
i
like
this
beer
a
lot
beer
is
good
happy
beering
the
10abv
is
extremely
well
hidden
in
this
ale
so
be
careful
a
good
ale
nothing
more
nothing
less
a
nice
treat
but
there
are
better
versions
of
the
style
out
there
smell
is
fruit
and
nuts
taste
is
sweet
and
spice
mouthfeel
is
prickly
and
smooth
i
will
search
out
more
tomorrow
i
hope
i
find
more
large

that
i
put
away
in
my
beer
celler
a
brown
paper
bag
in
the
back
of
a
closet
for
about
68
months
ago
corked
and
caged
opened
with
a
burst
of
carbonation
pours
a
rich
murky
cloudy
shade
of
dark
amber
hoists
a
light
tan
head
which
slowly
recedes
to
a
tiny
bubble

this
fine
elixir
leaves
stringy
soft

is
full
of

and
alcohol
notes
tangy
spicy

belgian

notes
lots
of
fresh
fruit
doughy
malt
offerings
and
some
chaotic
chemistry
and
wonder
going
on
in
this
complex
dandy
finishes
with
notes
of
rum
soaked
apricots
very
drinkable
and
a
hefty
10
this
one
really
benefitted
with
the
extra
time
in
the
bottle
i
imagine
it
would
continue
to
improve
for
quite
some
time
seek
out
stow
away
wait
and
enjoy
my
drinking
buddy
liked
this
a
lot
more
than
i
did
smooth
but
not
very
tasty
nor
complex
a
good
beer
but
not
the
best
quad
i
have
had
pours
a
bright
hazy
reddishorange
color
with
a
nice
offwhite
head
that
leaves
a
sticky

spicy

full

well
hidden
finishes
a
bit
sweet
what
can
i
say
i
dont
use
the
words
perfect
and
the
beer
is
lighter
then
expected
the
carbonation
issue
i
find
the
most
troubling
i
had
no
trouble
finishing
this
off
in
one
sitting
even
with
a
very
agressive
pour
into
my
tulip

frothy
white

with
a
true
belgium
character
the
taste
just
lingers
in

mouth
and

all
night
this
is
a
beer
that
truely
needs
to
be
experienced
to
understand
i

i
could
drink
this
and
nothing
else
for
the

but
still
not
strong
and
figlike
i
would
call
this
one
a
belgian
strong
dark
the
flavor
is
also
not
as
what
i
expect
from
the
style
this
is
a
good
beer
suggesting
a
complete
fermentation
and
finally
a
bit
of
a
nip
from
the
malt
its
not
overly
sweet
which
is
pleasantly
surprising
with
the
extra
fermentation
i
was
expecting
it
to
be
thicker
it
has
a
fairly
heavy
mouth
feel
very
sweet
easy
to
pick
up

the
only
negative
thing
about
this

as
you
would

for

but
then
again
so
i
told
him
i
thought
the
taste
was
reminiscent
of
the
grand
cru
with
a
lot
of
clove
spiciness
probably
not
my
favorite
beer
simply
because
its
not
my
favorite
style
but
no
doubt
one
of
the
best
ive
ever
had
wonderfully
done
o
it
would
be
nice
to
have
a
little
bit
less
boozy
flavor
although
it
fades
a
bit
as
the
beer
warms
up
to
taste
all
the
other
nice
things
happening
but
otherwise
a
great
beer
subtly
sweet
very
boozy
interesting

this
one
definitely
grows
on
you
brew
pours
a
pretty
hazy
amber
in

with
a
good
3finger
foamy
offwhite

a
good
amount
of

is
seen
when
sipped
that
sticks
to
the
sides
of
the
glass
lots
going
on
with
the
aroma
as
there
is
burnt
brown
sugar
spices
cloves
and
pepper
with
some
dark
fruit
overtones
more
going
on
with
the
taste
as
the
cloves
and
spices
are
right
up

with
the
brunt
brown
sugar
sweetness
with
a
hint
of
caramel
and
yeast
in
the
mix
along
with
some
plumsraisins
and
really
not
as
sweet
as
you
might
think
actually
finishes
pretty
smooth
without
tasting
the
alcohol
though
you
know
it
is
in
there
no
bitter
or
harsh
aftertaste
at
all

with
good
carbonation
overall
you
wont
get
to
the

definitely
lacked
the

of
a

was
not
bad
a
little
to
sweet
for
me
but
still
loved
it
great
job
for
a
american
quad
with
belgium

would
definitely
have
again
worth
a
shot
if
you
come
across
it
and

o
this
is
a
tremendous
beer
from
boulevard
im
not
crazy
about
this
style
but
i
will
return
to
the
sixth
glass
next
time
i
am
in
the
mood
for
a
serious
american
riff
on
this
classic
belgian
style
clear
orangeamber
color
with
lots
of
bubbles
from
the
center
and
a
large
quick
to
dissipate
offwhite
head
thats
quick
to
dissipate
with
decent
lacing
malt
dark
fruits
and
some
bubblegum
in
the
nose
alcohol
and
pepper
bite
in
the
taste
with
some
cherry
a
little
orange
and
more
gum
hop
bitterness
on
the
back
end
not
bad
but
not
the
greatest
overall
impression
a
big
belgian
dark
strong
ale
the
phenolics
are
a
one
trick
pony
and
i
would
have
liked
more
malt
or
fermentation
character
still
a
very
solid
example
of
the
style
not
quite
as
effervescent
as
ive
become
accustomed
to
with
this
style
lots
of
spiciness
and
fruity
phenols
soft
malty
body
with
warming
alcohol
in
finish
no
doubt
from
dark
candi
sugars
ive
only
had
two
boulevard
beers
and
they
have
both
been
outstanding
will
be
on
the
lookout
for
more
overal
incredible
quad
overall
i
wont
be
picking
this
one
back
up
when
i
want
a
quad
im
looking
for
yeast
esters
to
shine
against
a
backdrop
of
sweet
malt
this
doesnt
accomplish
that
at
all
it
tastes
like
an
attempt
to
hop
up
a
quad
back
to
abt

not

its
a

in

for
the

at
an

its
easy
to
see

them
up
medium
bodied
with
a
forward
almost
pushy
effervescence
warming
from
the
getgo
dry
finish
brings
out
a
slightly
harsh
astringency
but
it
isnt
offputting
wish
i
had
more
pour
very
carefully
i
lost
a
bit
of
brew
to
the
ever
expanding
head
on
this
i
find
it
solid
for
the
style
and
really
really
good
coming
from
an
american
brewery
there
are
hints
of
bubblegum
phenols
found
in
strong
dark
ales
but
it
is
very
well
controlled
compared
to
many
american
versions
ive
tried
big
rich
dark
fruit
dark
sugar
and
dark
malt
flavors
hops
serve
to
dry
up
the
mouthfeel
enough
to
keep
the
experience
from
being
a
cloying
one
this
sample
came
from
a
twelve
ounce
bottle
with
a
bottle
cap
not
sure
if
a
corked
version
would
change
the
character
or
not
i
am
happily
willing
to
investigate
this
matter
i
would
very
much
like
to
drink
this
next
to
other
examples
of
the
style
i
expect
it
would
do
very
well
pours
a
clear
copper
with
tons
of
sediment
in
suspension
with
thick
khaki
colored
head
that
settles
to
a
thin
cap
but
very
little
is
able
to
stick
smell
dates
and
clove
most
prominent
with
caramel
apple
and
a
little
spicy
hopping
mild
bready
back
taste
pear
caramel
candy
date
bread
and
plum
notes
fruity
but
too
quickly
into
big
earthiness
and
a
note
of
clove
for
a
quad
the
body
is
surprisingly
light
upfront
then
goes
limp
and
heavy
midsip
and
just
as
quickly
vanishes
fleeting
on
the
palate
for
the
4pack
price
certainly
worthy
but
im
not
picking
it
over
any
of
the
similarly
available
belgian
heavy
hitters
o
i
enjoyed
this
one
plenty
its
fruity
and
pleasant
theres
nothing
here
that
makes
me
feel
i
need
to
buy
this
one
a
gain
in
the
future
but
im
certainly
glad
to
have
tried
it
the
sixth
glass
pours
deep
rich
chestnut
with
a
slight
haze
with
a
pillowy
offwhite
foam
cap
that
mounds
up
over
the
rim
of
the
glass
the
nose
is
fruit
a
mix
of
large
pitted
and
dried
and
a
hint
of
dark
moist
carmel
cake
large
pitted
fruit
a
faint
citrus
dark
raisins
and
a
hint
of
fig
begin
the
palate
with
a
touch
of
chocolate
and
caramel
medium
full
body
with
above
average
carbonation
dark
fruits
booze
and
earthy
belgian
yeast
a
decent
americanmade
quad
o
on
the
lighter
side
of
the
quad
spectrum
so
maybe
not
what
people
tend
to
associate
with
the
style
as
much
great
attenuation
and
nice
fermentation
a
lot
of
great
complexity
and
character
here
it
really
began
to
grow
on
me
as
i
drank
my
way
through
it
solid
offering
i
have
no
problems
drinking
this
one
again
a
good
rep
of
the
style
overall
really
superb
and
unique
take
on
the
style
wonderful
job
would
love
to
try
again
this
is
a
great
quad
this
is
definitely
one
of
the
better
ones
ive
had
that
was
brewed
in
america
and
it
can
hang
with
examples
of
the
style
brewed
out
of
the
country
its
tough
to
beat
from
a
value
standpoint
as
well
well
executed
and
well
crafted
im
interested
in
what
some
age
would
do
this
the
flavor
has
a
deep
dark
fruit
overtone
lots
of
dates
and
prunes
followed
by
light
bubblegum
and
banana
my
issue
is
this
is
way
too
boozy
at
any
temperature
the
alcohol
can
be
found
in
taste
and
feel
this
really
opens
up
to
be
a
great
quad
but
washes
away
in
the
alcohol
mostly
straight
fours
without
analyzing
too
much
this
tasting
straightforward
raisinlike
dark
fruitiness
maltbased
with
perhaps
a
tad
heavy
carbonation
appreciating
the
spices
and
pretty
suspensions
in
this
beer
a
very
nice
quaff
overall
having
never
heard
of
this
brewery
before
i
am
pleasantly
surprised
by
how
good
this
is
definitely
my
new
favorite
nontrappist
quadrupel
delightfully
sweet
and
dense
a
musttry
for
any
drinker
of
heavier
beers
from
a
12
ounce
bottle
it
is
a
chestnut
color
towering
head
lots
of
lace
the
beer
is
hazy
with
a
few
yeast
floaties
in
suspension
the
aroma
is
of
yeast
spice
ripe
fruit
plums
and
some
malt
lots
of
alcohol
in
the
taste
warmth
and
spice
sweet
and
full

great
beer
ugh
miss
raisin
finish
is
too
much
to
bear
not
good
at
all
overall
boulevard
hit
a
homerun
with
this
beer
a
must
try
on
any
beer
list
tastes
kind
of
flat
and
boozy
at
first
like
malt
liquor
but
as
the
beer
warms
and
settles
a
nice
grapey
fruity
figgy
character
emerges
definitely
on
the
lighter
side
of
the
quad
flavor
spectrum
more
fruity
and
dry
than
chocolatey
and
sweet
still
the
booze
is
always
present
and
comes
off
a
little
hot
and
offputting
at
times
this
bottle
is
fresh
and
could
probably
benefit
from
some
age
poured
a
hazy
dark
amber
with
a
nice
two
finger
fluffy
offwhite
head
nice
retention
and
lacing
the
smell
was
candy
sugar
dark
fruits
and
some
grassy
notes
and
alcohol
the
taste
is
sweet
with
some
cherry
and
fig
flavors
some
sweet
malt
and
a
bit
of
estery
notes
mouthfeel
was
fairly
thick
and
creamy
very
smooth
with
a
nice
aftertaste
overall
this
one
is
pretty
close
to
some
of
the
better
belgian
quads
not
quite
there
yet
but
pretty
good
for
an
american
quad
750ml

into
a
goblet

light

a
little
to
sweet
for
me
and
lacking
the
complexity
i
look
for
in
the
style
yet
still
a
good
american
version
of
the
style
overall
this
beer
escapes
me
i
love
it
but
i
cant
quite
define
what
makes
it
so
good
tastewise
nevertheless
a
solid
beer
and
a
good
value
this
beer
was
good
all
around
nothing
wowed
me
but
i
wasnt
mad
i
drank
it
not
sure
ill
go
out
of
my
way
to
drink
it
again
but
id
take
it
over
many
other
brews
boulevard
brewing
sixth
glass
is
a
very
good
beer

of

is
definitely
one
of
my
favorite
go

beers
explosion

nice
finish

definitely
one
you
have
to
respect
but
its
too
goodto
sip
thankfully
not
an
overpowering
alcohol
taste
tangy
spicy
finish
easy
to
drink
o
definitely
a
sipping
beer
enjoyable
with
a
nice
amount
of
complexity
to
the
flavoraroma
but
definitely
a
big
beer
even
though
the
alcohol
is
well
hidden
very
sweet
overall
no
doubt
a
great
brew
however
it
certainly
falls
short
of
quads
like
abt
12
and
3
philosophers
in
my
opinion
o
really
nice
example
of
the
style
often
times
i
find
that
the
american
versions
of
quads
to
fall
short
in
a
lot
of
areas
but
that
was
not
the
case
here
certainly
not
of
st
bernardusrochewesty
caliber
but
worth
a
try
and
very
enjoyable

o
this
is
a
great
example
of
an
american
brewery
being
able
to
make
a
belgianstyle
beer
thats
indistinguishable
from
beers
made
in
that
country
an
excellent
brew
wonderful
beer
the
bros
have
it
right
world
class
the
only
reason
i
didnt
give
it
a
5
is
i
didnt
have
an
orgasm
literally
the
best
beer
ive
ever
had
in
my
entire
life
pours
a
nice
hazy
brown
with
little
to
no
head
smell
and
taste
of
strong
alcohol
but
this
brew
is
smooth
dark
fruits
stick
out
with
this
one
maybe
some
figs
and
raisins
taste
grows
on
you
for
sure
as
this
one
warms
up
a
bit
surprised
this
is
from
missouri
strong
phenolics
but
balanced
overall
with
a
subtle
cherry
flavor
light
in
colour
but
a
nice
american
take
on
the
style
nice
beer
but
it
is
a
bit
too
hoppy
for
a
quad
12

complexity

you
feel
the
abv
good
beer
dont
be
fooled
this
was
every
bit
as
strong
as
a
quad
should
be
and
this
beer
made
no
bones
about
it
coming
up
short
in
this
category
is
like
saying
that
you
shot
the
moon
and
missed
this
beer
still
made
it
to
the
stars
and
were
all
the
better
for
it
boulevard
should
be
commended
for
crafting
this
as
i
was
nearly
fooled
into
thinking
this
came
from
overseas
and
anyone
who
loves
belgian
beers
or
something
that
elevates
the
american
art
of
craft
brewing
owes
it
to
him
or
herself
to
give
this
a
go
its
strong
in
the
sense
that
all
the
components
to
this
beer
fit
in
harmoniously
together
with
results
worthy
of
its
worldclass
rating
on
here
mouthfeel
slick
but
with
an
almost
capsaicin
like
burn
mouthfeel
is
rich
and
sweet
with
very
little
alcohol
burn
quite
smooth
for
a
beer
of
this
strength
a
lot
of
american
brewers
have
nailed
tripels
quads
are
a
different
story
boulevard
has
done
an
outstanding
job
i
first
had
this
beer
when
i
was
living
in
missouri
if
you
ever
have
the
opportunity
to
try
it
make
sure
you
do
wonderful
flavor
with
a
high
alcohol
content
this
at
least
for
me
is
a
beer
that
i
only
have
one
at
a
time
it
goes
very
well
as
an
after
dinner
beer
crisp
and
light
20
something
ibus
its
perfect
after
a
long
day
at
work
amber
color
very
little
head
poured
cold
and
let
come
up
in
temp
for
15
to
20
reached
right
into
the
gray
matter
and
gave
me
a
happy
smile
overall
this
is
a
very
good
offering
of
an
american
brewer
trying
a
belgian
style
the
flavors
are
pinpoint
to
a
bsda
the
only
thing
that
lets
you
know
it
is
an
american
brewer
is
the
carbonation
the
body
and
carbonation
is
a
bit
light
for
a
quad
enough
said
this
is
worthy
fantastic
tastes
like
fig
and
plum
and
at
a
wonderful
10
5
percent
abv
it
really
gets
you
there
very
slight
warmness
of
alcohol
followed
by
an
aftertaste
to
die
for
fruity
but
not
overly
sweet
st
bernardus
has
a
son
and
sixth
glass
quadrupel
is
his
name
another
homerun
from
boulevard
beer
has
several
layers
of
flavor
malty
front
light
black
pepper
middle
belgium
yeast
and
sweet
finish
are
revealed
i
havent
had
this
beer
for
a
while
but
appreciate
it
more
than
the
last
time
i
had
it
not
as
good
as
id
hoped
the
other
belgians
from
boulevard
were
much
better
oveall
i
am
very
impressed
as
i
have
been
with
most
boulevard
beers
that
i
have
encountered
o
awesome
beer
highly
recommend
first
time
trying
this
from
boulevard
and
i
would
definitely
buy
again
i
am
very
impressed
o
a
wonderful
thick
beer
chocked
full
of
massive
flavors
and
big
character
extremely
malty
somewhat
sweet
with
some
interesting
fruit
characteristics
big
molasses
cherry
and
brown
sugar
flavors
on
top
of
its
malt
balance
delicious
and
complex
sixth
glass
pours
a
dark
reddish
color
with
a
nice
large
frothy
lacing
head
there
is
a
sweet
wine
like
aroma
there
is
a
rich
taste
nice
subtle
dry
fruit
flavors
wine
like
flavors
and
a
nice
warmth
from
the
alcohol
great
body
and
very
good
feel
overall
its
a
very
solid
and
very
tasty
quad
this
is
a
really
good
beer
it
has
sharp
teeth
so
be
wary
of
the
bite
the
abv
presents
itself
almost
instantly
the
taste
is
similar
to
many
other
quads
but
what
makes
this
one
unique
is
the
taste
of
almond
and
overt
caramel
the
mouthfeel
and
the
body
are
identical
in
many
respects
to
other
quads
but
the
level
of
smoothness
that
this
particular
one
brings
to
the
table
is
paralleled
by
few
others
its
definitely
worth
a
try
kansas
city
has
made
big
strides
to
match
the
monks
skills
and
pallet
like
what
trappiststyle
ales
seem
simplified
to
me
but
the
tangy
yeasts
and
bready
mouthfuls
of
flavor
in
this
bronson
are
smooth
despite
the
10
5
alcohol
really
impressed
with
this
number
even
considering
the
enormous
amount
of
decent
trappist
ales
out
there
fantastic
beer
that
i
look
to
make
a
staple
of
my
summer
tour
de
france
viewing
libation
menu
ooverall
a
great
example
of
a
trappist
quad
will
get
some
more
fairly
complex
brew
nice
dry
finish
prevents
it
from
being
cloying
and
the
esters
are
yummy
a
little
hot
this
would
age
well
o
i
liked
the
beer
but
for
the
quad
price
point
i
need
to
love
it
im
already
paying
premium
for
a
treat
so
ill
pay
a
buck
or
two
more
for
st
bernardus
this
is
what
i
would
expect
from
a
quad
and
this
quad
is
one
of
the
many
great
quads
out
there
you
must
try
this
one
hard
to
lump
this
into
a
category
of
quads
it
seems
to
want
to
be
its
own
class
of
alternative
quads
its
not
horrible
by
any
means
but
it
is
not
something
i
will
go
out
of
my
way
to
purchase
either
poured
from
a
12
oz
bottle
into
a
belgian
tulip
glass
overall
yet
another
traditional
belgian
style
that
boulevard
does
well
its
a
little
lighter
than
many
beers
in
the
quadbsda
category
but
thats
no
problem
by
my
view
the
only
thing
i
will
say
is
that
i
wish
there
were
a
little
more
depth
of
flavor
to
this
one
one
of
the
things
i
like
about
the
style
is
that
it
continues
to
evolve
and
develop
throughout
the
enjoyment
of
the
glass
this
one
was
pretty
similar
from
start
to
finish
as
such
i
feel
the
need
to
dock
the
overall
score
because
the
sum
of
its
parts
were
just
not
quite
as
good
as
the
individual
components
overall
outside
of
the
richness
of
the
beer
which
is
a
huge
element
this
beer
is
pretty
great
especially
for
being
an
american
made
quad
i
like
the
stuff
that
i
have
had
from
boulevard
i
just
havent
had
enough
look
forward
to
trying
some
more
of
their
stuff
in
the
future
well
priced
at
a
little
of
3
bucks
for
a
single
o
a
nice
drink
all
and
all
i
was
surprised
in
how
easy
it
was
to
drink
though
it
does
pack
a
punch
my
advice
dont
waste
your
money
i
realize
its
voted
world
class
but
pond
water
is
more
tasty
or
hell
sewer
water
like
the
aroma
the
roasted
malts
kick
things
off
with
a
return
play
by
the
cherrybased
defensive
receiver
there
is
this
definite
pungent
tart
bite
that
makes
me
wince
briefly
but
i
get
used
to
it
some
dry
afterbite
for
certain
a
little
booze
but
thats
to
be
expected
at
10
5
i
wonder
how
it
would
be
at
this
time
next
year
with
proper
cellaring
overall
i
really
enjoyed
this
beer
i
would
definitely
recommend
sixth
glass
to
a
friend
for
a
10
beer
you
can
taste
it
but
it
didnt
overwhelm
me
strong
bold
flavor
but
smooth
all
the
way
through
my
first
review
the
past
few
weeks
ive
been
drinking
these
and
really
digging
the
taste
out
of
the
handful
of
quad
ales
ive
tried
i
like
this
the
best
drinking
one
right
now
good
rich
color
a
lot
of
particles
in
it
but
i
like
the
added
sediment
you
could
pour
it
slowly
to
reduce
the
cloudiness
head
doesnt
stay
put
for
long
though
compared
to
other
abbey
ales
kind
of
reducing
aromas
or
maybe
i
should
stop
typing
and
finish
this
brew
right
cheers
o
a
pretty
good
quad
especially
from
an
american
brewery
nothing
spectacular
but
it
is
solid
in
every
aspect
enjoy
this
one
warms
quite
well
developing
character
along
the
way
it
makes
for
a
contemplative
beer
that
proves
to
be
quite
enjoyable
on
a
cool
autumn
evening
before
dinner
i
enjoyed
it
with
a
pungent
creamy
bleu
valdbon
the
cheese
brought
out
a
sweet
fruitiness
otherwise
not
detected
i
would
try
another
boulevard
beer
for
sure
though
picked
up
a
4
pack
at
old
farm
because
i
had
not
seen
this
before
and
big
fan
of
quads
awesome
looking
beer
great
head
that
grew
and
has
a
good
clean
smell
taste
is
excellent
great
balance
did
not
taste
as
strong
as
the
10
5
that
is
was
overall
is
was
a
great
beer
that
i
am
glad
i
have
3
more
of
and
will
buy
again
this
is
one
of
those
beers
that
tastes
better
with
every
drink
the
first
drink
your
like
omg
wtf
and
your
mouth
is
almost
hot
feeling
then
by
the
last
drink
you
have
an
oddly
clear
buzz
and
your
left
wanting
another
bottle
i
love
ales
but
this
was
almost
too
strong
for
me
it
barely
tasted
like
a
beer
i
think
the
high
note
of
this
beer
is
the
complexity
of
the
smells
and
taste
and
the
warmer
it
got
the
more
it
changed
at
nearly
10
bucks
a
bottle
i
honestly
dont
know
if
ill
get
more
but
its
definitely
one
to
try
for
sure
but
be
warned
the
taste
is
extremely
potent
i
think
the
majority
of
beer
drinkers
would
think
this
beer
is
hard
to
drink
it
doesnt
exactly
go
down
smooth
but
then
again
it
has
10
5
alc
so
thats
to
be
expected
some
wines
have
less
o
not
the
best
quad
out
there
but
definitely
worth
a
try
id
like
to
try
an
aged
bottle
or
the
bourbon
barrel
aged
version
nice
overall
a
very
enjoyable
sipping
brew
take
your
time
one
of
the
better
americanmade
quadruppels
that
ive
tasted
with
the
few
samples
which
ive
tasted
from
boulevard
it
appears
that
they
can
pull
off
belgian
styles
too
overall
a
great
beer
very
strong
on
the
spicy
end
for
a
quadrupel
it
is
interesting
and
a
different
take
on
the
style
maybe
not
the
best
but
different
and
unique
i
dont
drink
quads
very
often
theyre
not
really
a
style
i
prefer
but
i
do
truly
appreciate
great
versions
like
rocheforts
and
st
bernardus
with
that
said
ill
have
to
pass
on
sixth
glass
its
a
good
beer
worth
a
try
but
ill
skip
this
guy
in
the
future
booze
booze
booze
the
beer
was
absolutely
dominated
by
alcohol
it
gets
even
worse
as
it
warms
and
i
had
to
pour
it
out
i
dont
know
if
it
was
infected
as
it
nasted
like
nail
polish
and
alcohol
o
cold
weather
beer
no
way
i
could
drink
this
in
the
summer
or
any
weather
that
isnt
cold
rainy
and
above
40
degrees
so
sweet
with
a
huge
spice
profile
and
a
fragrant
alcoholic
character
the
flavored
and
mouthfeel
were
extraordinarily
wellbalanced
not
a
beer
to
be
consumed
cold
started
at
55
or
so
and
it
got
better
as
it
warmed
the
only
quadrupels
that
will
match
this
have
a
label
only
in
french
and
the
brewery
is
in
belgium
the
mouthfeel
was
medium
bodied
the
carbonation
was
the
key
to
how
enjoyable
this
was
it
was
just
a
hint
the
beer
left
a
light
film
across
the
tongue
and
finished
slightly
dry
overall
really
enjoyed
this
beer
it
reminded
me
a
bit
of
rochefort
but
with
a
touch
more
vibrant
fruitiness
othis
is
a
great
beer
and
one
of
the
better
american
quads
i
have
tried
it
packs
a
lot
of
flavor
and
complexity
and
mimics
the
feel
of
the
best
examples
of
this
style
i
dont
think
it
is
quite
up
to
the
level
of
the
belgians
but
i
would
definitely
drink
more
of
this
this
is
not
the
first
time
nor
the
last
ive
had
this
it
is
an
excellent
american
quad
with
wine
like
qualities
and
a
lot
of
complexity
delicious
overall
i
may
have
to
go
back
and
snag
the
saison
since
it
is
more
impressive
this
beer
is
a
great
quad
not
too
bozzy
or
sweet
wish
it
was
cheaper
though
but
its
pa
so
what
are
you
gonna
do
trading
would
be
more
expensive
wasnt
all
that
impressed
with
the
first
offering
that
i
sampled
from
boulevard
brewing
tank
7
but
this
quad
is
excellent
reddish
amber
in
color
an
inch
thick
layer
of
foam
rests
on
top
of
this
brew
brussels
lacing
on
the
glass
dark
belgian
candy
sugar
with
hints
of
caramel
intensely
thick
and
alcoholic
mouthfeel
this
is
serious
stuff
i
get
loads
of
sweet
malt
and
dark
belgian
candy
sugar
lingering
fade
of
belgian
yeast
and
dark
malt
this
is
a
great
teat
overall
a
perfect
beer
to
warm
up
with
while
its14
degrees
outside
easy
to
see
why
as
its
very
sweet
with
a
huge
spice
presence
and
fragrant
alcohol
the
prominent
alcohol
in
the
nose
left
an
odd
presence
but
i
really
enjoyed
it
in
the
taste
i
would
also
like
to
stress
that
this
is
one
of
those
beer
that
you
should
just
drink
at
cellar
temp
or
if
anything
chilled
in
only
got
better
as
it
warmed
overall
while
its
not
up
there
with
the
world
class
quads
i
still
highly
recommend
it
i
would
refer
this
to
everyone
of
my
kc
and
nonkc
friends
alike
great
ale
thank
you
boulevard
beer
is
medium
to
mediumheavy
in
body
with
carbonation
of
high
intensity
resulting
in
a
fizzy
prickly
mouthfeel
at
first
which
then
fades
to
a
foamy
910
and
slightly
smooth
110
feel
somewhat
overcarbonated
for
the
beer
and
the
style
with
time
correcting
this
ethanol
easily
felt
on
the
palate
back
of
throat
and
in
nostrils
not
well
integrated
into
the
beer
closes
dryly
with
substantial
stickiness
clinging
to
the
palate
and
lips
this
is
a
very
nice
easy
drinking
10
5
quad
probably
wouldnt
drink
more
than
one
in
a
sitting
but
it
makes
for
a
great
winterweekdayevening
sipper
o
an
outstanding
belgian
style
quad
anyone
who
likes
the
style
should
be
pleased
tastier
and
easier
drinking
than
some
barleywines
i
have
had
as
well
given
the
abv
id
look
for
the
twelve
ounce
fourpacks
instead
of
going
for
the
bomber
unless
you
have
a
friend
to
share
it
with
or
a
big
alcohol
tolerance
overall
flavorful
but
too
sharp
and
boozy
for
me
to
enjoy
much
of
oa
good
quad
but
it
doesnt
hold
a
candle
to
the
belgaintrappist
ones
o
this
is
a
good
true
beer
its
not
a
sneaky
buzz
you
are
keenly
aware
that
you
are
in
fact
drinking
beer
and
neednt
play
is
it
will
sit
you
down
that
being
said
the
flavor
is
superb
wellrounded
without
frills
which
is
easy
to
appreciate
o
stellar
quad
that
i
hope
will
improve
with
a
few
years
this
was
fresh
and
extremely
enjoyable
so
it
will
be
interesting
to
see
what
34
years
of
cellaring
will
do

summary
a

belgian
i

one
is

its

favorite
beers
its
definitely
a
beer
that
youre
going

want
to
serve
at
proper
temperature
so
let
it
warm
up
a
bit
to
get
the
full
experience
this
was
my
first
beer
from
boulevard
and
im
looking
forward
to
trying
more
its
a
good
one
to
have
on
hand
as
the
weather
cools
down
and
if
you
get
the
chance
to
pick
up
a
bottle
or
4pack
its
well
worth
the
money
o
good
flavor
for
sure
alcohol
is
extremely
well
tempered
quite
drinkable
carbonation
is
over
the
top
in
my
opinion
overall
smells
and
taste
great
but
the
floaties
is
kind
of
off
putting
just
didnt
expect
this
poured
a
ruby
red
brown
with
one
finger
head
that
died
quick
has
a
slightly
boozy
aroma
dark
fruits
and
figs
maybe
raisins
are
a
tad
noticeable
and
there
are
some
sweet
malts
beer
is
medium
bodied
smooth
real
sweet
for
some
reason
good
amount
of
caramel
candi
sugar
and
a
touch
of
fruit
sweetness
good
balance
as
i
get
some
dark
fruits
as
well
and
there
is
a
hearty
heavy
finish
not
a
bad
american
quad
at
all
and
well
worth
the
low
pricepoint
not
the
tastiest
or
most
complex
quad
but
it
got
the
job
done
this
is
a
solid
if
slightly
different
quad
with
lots
of
peppery
notes
along
with
the
usual
fig
and
other
dark
fruit
tastes
not
as
bready
or
complex
as
the
best
in
this
style
but
it
still
provides
a
satisfying
experience
for
lovers
of
quads
starts
out
good
in
taste
if
a
little
thin
but
then
gets
better
as
it
warms
you
also
start
to
notice
the
alcohol
heat
as
you
drink
longer
maybe
just
a
little
too
much
the
aroma
is
nice
with
figs
and
some
alcohol
predominating
very
nice
and
the
best
ive
had
from
boulevard
so
far
although
i
look
forward
to
saison
brett
i
am
afraid
i
set
myself
up
for
disappointment
on
this
one
i
was
hoping
to
have
an
experience
similar
to
a
la
trappe
but
it
wasnt
there
the
color
is
amazing
smell
wasnt
horrible
either
my
biggest
dissappoinment
was
in
the
flavor
and
mouthfeel
they
are
almost
intertwined
for
me
on
this
it
didnt
have
the
smooth
and
rich
feel
i
was
expecting
and
that
brought
along
a
kind
of
harsh
flavor
for
me
i
am
not
sad
i
tried
it
but
it
will
not
make
it
into
the
regular
line
up
overall
this
is
an
extremely
impressive
brew
probably
the
best
american
quad
i
have
experienced
to
date
including
allagash
four
this
beer
thus
far
for
me
is
the
best
example
of
an
american
crafted
belgian
quad
very
good
beer
and
at
a
great
price
point
i
am
so
excited
these
guys
have
expanded
to
ohio
as
ive
been
a
fan
for
a
long
time
any
fans
of
belgian
quads
will
enjoy
this
beer
also
has
a
slight
uniqueness
that
you
dont
find
in
a
belgian
but
i
cant
quite
put
my
finger
on
what
it
is
smooth
in
the
mouth
and
disappears
in
the
glass
too
quickly

m
d
the
alcohol
is
certainly
not
hidden
on
this
one
and
it
can
be
a
little
heavy
as
the
bottle
goes
i
find
that
many
other
quads
keep
this
element
of
the
beer
more
under
control
or
subdued
relative
to
the
other
highlights
of
the
beers
its
certainly
a
decent
brew
yet
i
believe
its
open
to
some
improvements
o
a
good
quad
lots
of
rich
flavors
and
a
nice
balance
12
oz
ends
up
being
a
fair
amount
of
this
beer
and
im
glad
its
not
a
750
ml
not
as
interesting
as
some
quads
perhaps
a
little
too
balanced
if
that
makes
any
sense
just
a
lot
of
god
flavors
all
playing
together
nicely
o
rich
complex
malty
and
boozy
this
is
a
solid
quad
that
begs
to
be
sipped
over
and
over
another
winner
from
the
smokestack
series
taste
is
less
complex
than
the
not
overly
complex
aroma
bit
of
caramel
and
some
muddled
fruits
nothing
negative
to
deter
yet
overly
one
sided
perhaps
too
much
science
and
not
enough
art
clean
comes
to
mind
feel
is
soft
and
creamy
nonetheless
isnt
overly
sweet
and
yet
still
capable
of
masking
the
abv
to
a
large
degree
overall
a
pretty
well
executed
though
not
so
well
designed
brew
that
drinks
like
a
lighter
dubbel
needs
more
malt
complexity
to
call
itself
a
quad
overall
a
very
good
american
quad
it
does
not
hold
a
candle
to
the
belgian
classics
but
it
is
a
very
nice
beer
would
be
better
if
the
booze
was
toned
down
thick
rich
with
a
bit
of
spice
deep
amber
in
color
with
a
nice
head
first
sip
was
exceptional
as
the
carbonation
seemed
to
enhance
the
spice
smooth
with
just
a
minor
hint
of
bitterness
at
the
end
almost
a
perfect
balance
exceptionally
easy
to
drink
i
tried
to
take
it
slow
to
savor
it
but
it
slides
down
the
throat
with
the
greatest
of
ease
o
my
first
try
at
a
quad
was
very
different
than
anything
else
ive
had
very
strong
everywhere
a
sipping
beer
best
with
some
food
some
good
cheese
and
crackers
would
be
good
cant
pick
out
the
unique
flavors
ill
need
to
have
another
and
try
again
its
not
a
knock
to
say
its
gritty
and
slightly
staining
delightful
as
doesnt
sit
at
all
heavy
not
anymore
so
than
an
amber
o
patow
if
i
could
afford
to
stock
my
refer
with
this
beer
i
would
drink
drank
drunk
gbuzzard
overall
probably
the
best
you
could
expect
from
a
quad
that
isnt
bottle
conditioned
this
is
definitely
worth
a
try
and
a
steal
at
the
price
just
dont
think
youve
found
a
replacement
for
rochefort
bernardus
or
gasp
westy
theres
a
reason
you
pay
money
for
the
big
hitters
not
a
bad
quad
but
there
are
a
few
things
holding
this
back
from
being
really
enjoyable
to
me
the
problem
is
my
palate
like
many
others
has
been
spoiled
like
a
preteen
in
belair
by
things
like
westvletern
xii
and
st
bernardus
abt
12
those
beers
have
changed
the
quad
game
forever
and
sixth
glass
doesnt
quite
hit
the
bar
still
enjoyable
but
nothing
to
get
hard
over
this
is
a
very
good
example
of
a
belgian
quad
some
sweetness
with
fruit
aromas
and
flavors
maybe
a
bit
boozy
oa
really
nice
quad
at
a
good
price
and
an
easily
enjoyable
regular
offering
will
definitely
be
drinking
more
of
this
i
was
blown
away
when
i
opened
this
bottle
the
smell
of
all
sorts
of
sweet
dark
fruits
blasted
me
in
the
nose
frankly
quads
arent
the
most
attractive
looking
beers
in
the
world
so
i
didnt
take
long
to
admire
the
appearance
of
it
but
man
does
it
smell
fucking
wonderful
upon
smelling
this
brew
its
hard
to
believe
that
it
is
10
5
abv
and
even
though
its
more
relevant
a
taste
upon
drinking
it
the
presence
of
dark
fruits
and
spices
are
much
easier
to
identify
i
dont
know
enough
about
quads
to
be
able
to
compare
this
to
the
style
but
i
know
that
i
definitely
like
this
beer
like
a
lot
the
dark
fruit
characters
are
the
star
in
this
one
plums
raisins
fig
are
all
easily
picked
out
if
you
like
dark
fruit
characteristics
rather
than
the
more
caramelmolasses
heavy
quads
this
might
just
be
the
best
one
you
can
buy
overall
very
enjoyable
definitely
will
try
again
overall
a
very
satisfying
quad
i
generally
like
my
quads
as
i
like
my
women
sweet
and
rich
i
like
the
malt
to
be
front
and
center
and
just
enough
spice
to
add
complexity
still
this
is
a
nice
departure
from
my
usual
ventures
in
this
style
definitely
a
distinct
offering
in
a
field
populated
by
several
world
classics
that
are
among
the
greatest
of
all
beers
ive
had
a
few
quads
and
this
one
stands
out
as
one
of
the
spiciest
ones
i
probably
wouldnt
buy
it
again
for
just
that
reason
but
those
who
enjoy
this
style
and
dont
have
a
sweettooth
like
mine
will
probably
love
this
its
a
terrific
beer
just
not
quite
what
i
look
for
in
a
quad
what
an
interesting
twist
on
the
style
as
indicated
by
their
saison
it
seems
these
guys
get
traditional
recipes
and
provide
their
own
americanized
rendition
of
them
this
is
not
the
greatest
quad
ive
ever
had
but
it
is
not
a
chore
to
drink
at
all
and
the
raisincaramel
profile
is
quite
good
here
if
only
lacking
complexity
i
would
love
to
revisit
this
one
for
sure
definitely
looking
forward
to
trying
more
of
their
belgianstyle
beers
the
beer
pours
a
murky
brown
with
a
fluffy
tan
head
that
laces
with
a
residual
thin
blanketing
the
nose
is
fruity
malty
molassesy
a
little
boozy
and
has
a
touch
of
yeastbread
this
drinks
with
stone
fruit
upfront
big
malty
sweetness
followed
by
a
spicy
boozy
effervescent
finish
and
lingering
plumb
fruitiness
this
is
a
heavymedium
bodied
strong
flavored
fruity
quad
with
masked
booze
and
great
yeast
definitely
a
good
beer
that
has
aged
well
with
12
years
on
it
highly
recommended
if
your
in
the
quad
mood
an
allaround
delicious
quadrupel
varied
malt
sweetness
dance
with
intriguing
boozy
and
bitter
notes
all
combined
in
a
wellbalanced
nicely
complex
form
a
real
pleasure
to
the
visual
smell
and
taste
senses
drank
from
a
goblet
o
the
strong
amount
of
malty
sweetness
in
this
beer
makes
it
somewhat
difficult
to
drink
but
this
is
something
that
really
needs
to
be
sipped
given
its
strength
it
definitely
tastes
strong
but
any
flavors
of
alcohol
are
very
well
hidden
overall
i
like
this
beer
overall
not
at
all
a
typical
quad
its
lighter
simpler
and
far
easier
to
drink
it
doesnt
have
the
same
complex
contemplative
nature
that
define
the
classic
belgian
quads
but
if
you
think
of
it
as
a
a
fresh
and
original
take
on
the
classic
style
its
a
very
nice
brew
overall
a
nice
quad
for
sure
not
an
all
the
time
beer
or
an
all
the
time
style
but
worth
trying
o
very
good
version
sweet
but
not
the
overly
dominating
sweet
aged
fruit
is
blended
perfectly
booze
does
comes
thru
in
the
end
has
the
full
body
taste
but
wished
there
was
that
velvet
mouth
feel
wish
the
nose
was
stronger
not
a
fan
of
quads
really
but
this
is
one
of
the
best
american
renditions
ive
tried
cheers
absolutely
one
of
the
best
quads
ive
ever
drank
nice
deep
yellow
color
with
an
orange
hue
the
aroma
was
like
heaven
with
all
though
components
spices
fruit
hops
and
malts
and
you
cant
believe
your
drink
an
ale
thats
10
alcohol
so
mellow
but
be
careful
it
can
jump
up
and
bite
you
great
brew
cant
wait
to
buy
a
case
of
four
packs
mouthfeel
is
never
too
sharp
with
all
flavors
being
represented
equally
10
5
abv
would
not
have
imagined
until
consuming
3
or
more
of
these
puppies
i
forgot
to
mention
come
on
nevada
talk
to
boulevard
bring
it
in
o
a
nice
slow
sipper
this
american
quad
is
a
good
example
of
the
style
could
use
a
little
more
complexity
but
again
it
does
open
up
quite
a
bit
as
it
warms
good
value
and
easy
to
find
overall
a
very
good
american
version
of
a
belgian
quad
great
yeast
and
fruit
esters
with
a
good
sweet
malt
base
i
gotta
say
im
not
a
huge
fan
of
this
one
i
like
the
boozy
warmth
in
the
chest
and
its
not
a
bad
beer
but
i
am
just
not
sold
on
it
im
not
mad
i
tried
it
at
all
its
just
the
style
i
cant
really
get
into
overall
a
pretty
good
quad
its
a
slightly
smoother
thicker
but
boozy
take
on
the
style
overall
awesome
stuff
nice
kc
version
of
this
belgian
classic
tastes
so
smooth
and
airy
that
its
hard
not
to
down
this
too
quickly
high
abv
that
hits
you
fast
the
sediment
rolling
around
the
redorange
color
is
amazing
to
me
pretty
much
zero
head
and
great
carbonation
my
absolute
favorite
part
of
this
beer
is
the
after
taste
in
the
back
of
your
throat
on
the
finish
the
plum
and
caramel
smell
is
favorable
and
i
wish
i
had
saved
my
bottle
for
a
pairing
i
will
definitely
buy
more
of
these
to
put
on
my
summertime
beer
pairing
schwing
town
overall
a
budget
quad
i
cant
always
have
a
rocheford
10
and
im
happy
enough
drinking
this
one

enjoy
best
quad
we
ever
had
slightly
better
than
weyerbacher
quad
this
beer
while
substantial
is
not
overbearing
the
earthy
taste
is
great
for
winter
days
or
for
big
juicy
steaks
this
is
a
great
beer
o
i
probably
could
have
scored
this
higher
but
ive
only
had
a
handful
of
quads
would
definitely
drink
again
overall
one
of
the
best
quads
that
i
can
easily
find
in
the
midwest
for
half
the
price
can
not
beat
this
beer
unless
you
work
really
hard
massages
your
tongue
with
a
smooth
and
creamy
medium
mouthfeel
and
gives
a
nice
happy
ending
i
recommend
this
beer
thoroughly

a
keeper
with
this
one
solid
quad
with
some
minor
issues
that
may
be
related
to
storage
rather
than

the
flavor
of
sixth

o

glad
to
have
stumbled
upon
a
bottle
of
this
one
deep
red
garnet
hue
with
a
bubbly
thin
head
smells
of
raisins
and
other
earthy
fruits
with
a
hint
of
oak
tastes
the
same
the
taste
was
of
deep
fruit
prunesetc
but
with
a
hint
of
chocolate
the
appearance
was
the
beast
part
of
the
beer
it
was
beautiful
its
a
very
strong
beer
and
im
usually
not
a
fan
of
quadrupel
belgians
but
this
one
was
fantastic
the
subtle
fruit
notes
and
dash
of
chocolate
made
for
a
great
flavor
mouthfeel
was
crisp
an
enjoyable
quad
from
the
folks
at
boulevard
poured
into
a
tulip
glass
a
very
nice
amber
and
cream
colored
head
that
lingers
fruity
aroma
and
bit
medicinal
likely
due
to
the
high
alcohol
content
but
not
unpleasant
at
all
the
taste
was
surprising
the
fruitiness
comes
through
up
front
followed
by
dryness
with
some
bitterness
that
i
wasnt
expecting
based
on
my
experience
with
other
quads
a
very
pleasant
surprise
though
after
a
few
sips
to
get
the
full
effect
i
settled
back
and
savored
every
mouthful
an
excellent
quad
and
definitely
worth
a
return
engagement
the
beer
pours
a
cloudy
reddish
amber
color
with
a
few
fingers
of
a
creamy
off
white
head
the
head
sticks
around
nicely
throughout
the
pour
i
had
this
next
to
a
bbq
im
getting
slight
sweetness
with
some
dark
fruit
there
is
also
a
slight
banana
note
this
has
some
age
and
it
has
smoothes
things
out
there
is
a
slight
cherry
note
to
the
beer
in
the
finish
im
getting
the
dark
fruit
and
cherry
in
the
finish
i
liked
this
more
than
the
bbq
the
beer
pours
a
dark
maple
syrup
and
candy
brown
with
a
creamy
yellow
head
that
sits
at
a
half
fingers
width
with
lots
of
small
tightly
packed
bubbles
carbonation
bubbles
can
be
clearly
seen
racing
to
replenish
the
head
but
the
beers
body
is
murky
and
hazed
letting
very
little
light
pass
through
even
though
the
beer
is
clearly
not
black
lacing
is
sparse
thin
and
patchy
on
the

of
the

smells
like
spicy
cinnamon
raisin
bread
with
a
touch
of
cloying
alcohol
dark
fruit
malts
give
a
firm
body
to
the
smell
highly
suggesting
raisins
but
also
verging
on
dates
and
perhaps
a
touch
of
plums
though
the
malt
also
suggest
rich
dark
caramel
on
the
tongue
the
beer
tastes
richly
raisinlike
with
good
sweet
plum
notes
and
alcohol
spice
backing
and
a
touch
of
bready
yeast
at
the
close
the
beer
begins
with
light
spicy
alcohol
before
opening
into
sweet
raisin
and
then
slowly
moving
towards
sweet
plum
the
close
brings
the
yeast
to
the
forefront
suggesting
breadier
belgian
yeast
characteristics
inbetween
the
sweet
dark
fruit
notes
the
malt
is
mostly
dark
fruit
but
does
suggest
the
lightest
bit
of
caramel
and
brown
sugar
from
the
beginning
spicy
alcohol
bubbles
under
the
tongue
and
the
flavor
placing
the
sweetness
of
the
beer
just
below
cloying
on
the
mouth
the
beer
feels
thick
and
creamy
with
a
touch
of
sticky
heaviness
on
the
tongue
the
carbonation
is
light
and
fluffy
and
the
mouth
is
left
slightly
dry
and
slightly
cloyed
with
sweet
sugar
and
a
tingle
of
alcohol
overall
the
beer
is
a
success
within
the
style
and
a
lovely
beer
overall
the
beer
has
great
rich
and
complex
flavors
masking
the
heavy
alcohol
nicely
while
still
letting
you
know
that
this
beer
is
for
sipping
a
success
from
boulevard
the
nose
is
overpoweringly
figgy
figs
dates
raisins
dark
fruit
toffee
brown
sugar
a
hint
of
vanilla
an
oaky
undertone
and
did
i
mention
figs
the
taste
is
mad
figgy
too
heavy
dark
fruit
figs
dates
brown
sugar
toffee
oak
caramel
raisins
a
hint
of
alcohol
warmth
bready
notes
and
a
surprisingly
light
but
substantial
body
and
lively
carbonation
this
is
a
great
quad
and
the
best
of
the
smokestack
series
that
i
have
had
i
wish
i
wouldve
gotten
more
than
one
im
sad
now
o
really
nice
quad
one
of
my
favorites
in
the
group
this
will
have
to
become
one
of
my
regular
purchases
they
should
rename
this
beer
overkill
all
they
need
to
do
is
to
dump
in
an
insane
amount
of
hops
to
take
this
beer
right
over
the
top
overall
3
75
unusual
and
satisfyingly
big
and
heavy
quad
this
certainly
does
not
taste
like
any
traditional
belgian
quad
i
have
ever
had
and
the
emphasis
on
the
hops
and
the
malt
is
reminicent
of
stones
double
bastard
however
this
brew
is
more
dry
and
somewhat
less
heavy
on
the
flavors
o
excellent
dubbel
perfect
balance
and
very
tasty
o
a
fantastic
quad
that
i
cant
recommend
enough
the
flavors
body
and
finish
are
impecible
its
complexity
is
enhanced
by
the
fact
that
the
booze
dont
overwhelm
it
this
stands
up
to
3philosophers
and
the
best
of
the
belgians
overall
a
very
good
and
approachable
quad
i
think
you
could
have
multiples
of
this
and
not
completely
shred
your
palette
or
be
completely
consumed
with
sweetness
the
alcohol
content
is
another
story
i
still
think
the
standout
beer
from
this
brewery
is
the
tank
7
farmhouse
but
if
i
had
a
friend
that
liked
belgian
beer
and
never
had
a
quad
to
start
with
this
one
o
this
is
not
the
way
a
quad
should
go
down
maybe
i
shouldve
given
it
more
time
in
the
bottle
but
as
it
is
its
not
so
pleasant
still
it
pairs
pretty
well
with
brie
o
just
an
outstanding
quadrupel
packed
full
of
malty
flavor
yet
highly
drinkable
boulevards
quadrupel
offering
pours
a
rich
dark
amber
color
with
just
a
touch
of
garnet
hue
the
light
colored
head
dissipates
very
quickly
leaving
only
a
rim
around
the
edge
the
aroma
is
sweet
and
fruity
with
hints
of
apple
pear
and
dates
the
first
sip
delivers
a
well
balanced
beer
there
is
a
caramel
sweetness
followed
by
just
the
right
amount
of
bitter
there
is
a
lingering
alcohol
warmth
after
swallowing
subsequent
sips
provide
a
depth
of
sweetness
the
caramel
fades
a
bit
and
the
fruity
notes
come
forward
sixth
glass
has
a
rich
mouthfeel
with
a
mild
foamy
effervescence
its
not
too
syrupy
but
delivers
a
richness
that
a
quad
should
overall
this
is
a
great
beer
it
keeps
one
wanting
more
sip
after
sip
o
overall
this
beer
is
awesome
one
of
my
favorite
belgian
style
beers
the
bottle
i
used
for
this
review
was
about
9
months
old
but
ive
also
had
it
fresh
its
definitely
better
aged
i
would
buy
this
beer
again
o
this
brew
has
it
all
as
good
a
quad
as
i
have
ever
had
looks
smells
tastes
great
if
you
are
a
fan
of
belgian
quads
you
have
to
try
this
one
this
brewery
is
very
impressive
as
i
have
loved
the
long
strange
tripel
and
the
doublewide
ipa
glad
to
have
them
here
in
ga
overall
though
this
is
a
solid
quad
and
worth
trying
if
this
is
your
style
doesnt
come
off
too
boozy
either
but
quite
right
to
fit
o
a
pretty
good
brew
sadly
theres
rochforte
10
st
b
12
to
compare
it
to
and
it
does
not
stack
up
the
smell
is
nice
and
the
brown
sugar
is
a
plus
but
its
way
to
boozy
imo
the
way
a
brewery
can
hide
this
is
a
main
staple
when
deciding
on
the
quality
of
it
its
decent
but
i
wont
be
buying
it
again
o
really
was
digging
this
beer
and
was
a
good
interpretation
of
an
abbey
quad
overall
im
glad
i
tried
it
i
think
ill
carry
on
sampling
some
other
quads
before
i
come
back
to
this
one
it
tastes
good
enough
and
will
definitely
make
you
very
jolly
in
a
good
hurry
i
felt
warm
after
two
sips
the
price
was
also
very
good
even
compared
to
the
same
beer
in
different
areas
i
paid

a
must
try
o
i
really
like
this
beer
this
is
my
first
quad
and
the
first
time
with
this
beer
but
overall
i
enjoy
it
doesnt
feel
as
boozy
as
a
belgian
strong
o
solid
take
of
a
quad
i
think
i
like
the
long
strange
trippel
slightly
better
but
this
is
another
solid
offering
from
boulevard
large

big
focus
on
the
black
cherries
and
a

alcohol
burn
slight
dry
finish
after
a
mediumheavy
body
decent
quad
but
nothing
to
call
home
about
i
continue
to
find
boulevard
to
make
medicore
brews
a
good
all
around
quad
and
further
evidence
to
me
that
boulevard
knows
what
they
are
doing
this
is
delicious
a
slow
sipper
for
sure
with
complex
flavors
i
recommend
drinking
this
without
food
accompaniment
as
theres
a
lot
going
on
here
its
a
bit
harsh
boozey
and
just
intense
with
flavor
and
very
very
sweet
nice
brew
that
would
likely
benefit
from
some
aging
to
mellow
this
out
i
usually
like
my
quads
a
bit
darker
and
mellow
but
this
is
a
good
interpretation
a
deep
hazy
rusty
brown
color
with
a
healthy
light
tan
layer
of
foam
on
top
and
generous
lacing
the
aroma
notes
brown
sugar
and
maple
sweetness
caramel
and
some
grassy
bite
pretty
heavy
duty
but
compelling
for
the
sweet
tooths
out
there
the
flavor
follows
suit
with
a
murky
blend
of
grass
hops
smothered
in
clove
malt
and
more
brown
sugar
somewhat
cloying
with
a
hint
of
fruit
nougat
sherry
the
body
is
pretty
much
full
with
a
nice
velvety
feel
carbonation
is
smooth
and
full
this
is
a
classy
brew
for
those
that
can
handle
a
little
sugar
shock
overall
good
but
not
world
clase
this
is
a
really
solid
beer
its
complex
and
delicious
the
abv
is
completely
hidden
and
the
crisp
carbonation
lightens
the
body
making
this
very
drinkable
i
will
definitely
have
this
quad
again
overall
this
beer
was
a
pretty
big
letdown
after
saving
it
for
2
years
maybe
it
was
better
fresh
but
in
my
experience
strong
belgian
ales
are
best
at
about
2
years
anyway
the
beer
lacked
the
super
dark
caramelized
sugars
and
other
darker
fruits
that
are
necessary
for
a
stellar
quad
this
is
almost
like
a
belgian
barley
wine
or
a
belgian
strong
amber
ale
i
know
that
doesnt
exist
as
a
style
but
its
not
dark
and
its
not
golden
a
disappointment
for
me
considering
the
high
rankings
on
this
site
as
per
usual
so
fool
me
once
shame
on
you
fool
me
twice
shame
on

a
nice
twist

flavors
for
me
overall
the
high

is
noticeable

not
extreme
would
get
this
again
as
a
holiday
sipper
o
really
good
beer
highly
recommended
not
a
huge

but
this
beer
is
well
done
it
was
definitely

will
love

i

im
blending
categories
but
i
think
im
right
on
this
one
easily
one
of
the
best

had
just
a
really
good

goes

some
floaties

well
scent
is
quite
lovely
very
similar
to
a
true
trappist

blended
nicely

belgian
yeast
aromas
dark

and
fresh

with
some

spicy
finish
on

the
high

is
there
but
its
not
overwhelming
at
all
very
wellbalanced
mouthfeel
is
full
bodied
creamy
and
crisp
at
the
same
time
tingly
spicy
finish
drinkability
is
high
for
such
a
big
beer
overall
this
is
one
of
the
better
american
quads
out
there
very
tasty
and
im
so
glad
boulevard
comes
to
california
now
o
cant
tell
its
10
5
decent
drinkability
for
a
quad
not
my
favorite
style
but
this
is
a
pretty
good
interpretation
for
an
american
brewery
though
it
is
lacking
in
complexity
good
to
see
boulevard
here
in
nc
poured
into
a
chalice
a
deep
auburn
just
like
the
bottle
says
with
a
large
but
pretty
quick
to
fade
off
white
head
atop
dark
fruits
abound
in
the
nose
along
brown
sugar
and
sweet
alcohol
cakey
flavors
like
that
of
christmas
cake
that
has
soaked
in
alcohol
for
awhile
toffee
and
a
faint
shot
of
yeasty
spiced
notes
as
well
its
a
little
hot
but
it
doesnt
hinder
the
beer
much
a
solid
quad
its
not
a
big
complex
monster
but
it
has
all
the
components
of
a
solid
quad
overall
nothing
much
bad
to
say
a
very
solid
quad
but
lacking
in
some
complexity
may
improve
with
some
age
overall
quite
good
not
great
easy
drinker
for
a
big
beer
id
buy
this
again
its
very
nicely
done
being
such
an
affordable
quad
brewed
in
the
us
great
must
try
beer
on
the
fuller
end
of
medium
bodied
with
a
more
interesting
flavor
profile
than
the
aroma
suggests
theres
a
very
nice
balance
of
peppery
spice
sweet
malt
vinous
fruit
and
subtle
alcohol
without
a
trace
of
heat
making
it
deceptively
drinkable
some
zesty
clove
and
pepper
up
front
followed
by
silky
chocolate
caramel
and
toffee
the
malt
notes
are
countered
by
dark
fruit
sweetness
giving
off
hints
of
plum
raisin
dark
cherry
and
fig
lingering
into
a
slightly
dry
finish
perfectly
balanced
and
the
10

abv
is
excellently
masked
i
enjoyed
this
beer
very
much
and
had
to
stop
myself
from
guzzling
down
the
whole
750ml
to
quickly
o
very
tasty
and
smooth
quadrupel
with
deep
balanced
flavors
almost
like
a
heavier
version
of
a
duvel
nice
dryness
thats
not
overwhelming
bottle
indicates
aromas
of
date
and
fig
which
i
didnt
pick
up
and
im
not
sure
id
recognize
them
anyway
quite
drinkable
even
with
the
high
abv
o
while
this
is
a
good
quad
i
feel
the
balance
is
a
little
off
and
the
carbonation
hits
to
hard
at
the
front
of
the
taste
however
will
drink
again
and
recommend
to
try
d
complexity
is
the
name
of
the
game
for
this
one
which
was
a
very
welcome
introduction
to
boulevard
sinful
and
indulgent
if
this
is
any
indication
of
the
rest
of
their
lineup
i
cant
wait
to
try
some
more
a
rock
solid
quad
that
kept
my
undivided
attention
throughout
a
very
nice
brew
that
i
highly
recommend
after
continuing
to
sip
this
i
had
to
downgrade
the
taste
from
a
3
i
struggled
through
this
glass
and
i
dont
ever
plan
to
drink
it
again
hoping
that
boulevards
bbq
is
nothing
like
this
at
least
nothing
like
the
bad
half
how
does
a
10
beer
come
across
as
this
alcoholforward
overall
love
boulevards
take
on
this
style
you
can
tell
how
much
effort
they
put
into
this
one
highly
recommend
due
to
the
drinkabilityyet
a
beer
one
should
definitely
savor
o
overall
very
nice
not
quite
as
good
as
some
of
the
belgians
out
there
but
delicious
nonetheless
this
was
a
pretty
good
take
on
a
belgian
quad
from
boulevard
with
a
nice
mix
of
fruit
spice
and
sugars
that
kept
this
flavorful
in
its
profiles
that
10
abv
is
deceptively
hid
as
well
watch
out
a
noble
crack
at
the
belgian
quad
but
not
spectacular
this
one
seems
like
it
could
use
a
bit
more
time
to
mellow
out
a
bit
ill
revisit
my
other
bottle
in
a
year
or
so
o
it
was
a
good
quad
although
my
mind
calls
forth
memories
of
some
better
ones
ill
pass
on
this
one
next
time
the
shape
of
the
bottle
the
quirky
label
artwork
and
the
boulevard
brewing
co
name
engraved
on
the
neck
gave
off
a
very
european
vibe
the
body
looked
a
little
paler
than
a
typical
quad
with
the
color
of
mahogany
the
head
was
fizzy
and
short
lived
settling
down
to
a
lacy
collar
the
smell
had
fragrances
of
apricot
hazelnut
and
pear
the
flavor
was
delicately
sweet
and
a
bit
spicy
i
could
taste
raisin
pears
saffron
toffee
and
chili
pepper
the
aftertaste
was
sweet
like
hard
candy
until
abruptly
being
cut
off
by
yeasty
dryness
quite
sticky
in
the
mouth
and
not
quite
as
velvety
smooth
like
the
true
belgian
varieties
the
beer
would
have
benefited
from
some
darker
malts
to
further
enhance
the
date
and
fig
flavors
mentioned
on
the
label
and
add
complexity
all
in
all
a
very
solid
and
tasty
quad
a
great
american
rendition
of
a
great
belgian
style
the
sixth
glass
is
a
very
drinkable
not
too
filling
enjoyable
american
brewed
quad
well
done
boulevard
i
sure
wish
boulevard
distributed
in
michiganhint
hint
boulevard
nothing
exraordiary
but
well
made
and
undeniably
tasty
o
this
is
only
okay
in
a
line
up
i
could
definitely
confuse
it
with
a
true
belgian
though
it
has
a
certain
rawness
i
like
to
see
in
my
quads
the
flavors
themselves
arent
wonderful
though
its
strong
definitely
a
sipper

poured
into
a
gulden
draak
tulip
pours
a
dark
orange
amber
with
an
aggressive
light
brown
head
and
nice
lacing
hops
and
malt
right
up
front
with
a
slap
of
booze
light
malt
and
fruit
middle
with
a
sharp
edge
from
the
carbonation
boozy
hop
finish
underlying
taste
is
nice
but
he
alcohol
is
not
well
integrated
light
bodied
this
was
absolutley
delicious
with
a
chocolate
chip
cookie
o
a
solid
quad
from
boulevard
not
as
sweet
as
some
of
the
other
quads
out
there
but
would
definitely
make
a
great
fallwinter
beer
for
tailgating
in
cold
weather
wonderfully
warming
would
make
an
excellent
winter
beer
over
all
it
is
a
great
beer
that
i
would
recommend
dont
get
me
wrong
though
this
is
still
one
of
the
best
american
quads
ive
ever
had
if
you
cant
find
the
two
ive
mentioned
or
dont
want
to
drop
8
or
13
respectively
for
a
single
bottle
of
the
aforementioned
then
go
ahead
and
grab
this
o
a
solid
and
really
well
made
quad
not
quite
up
to
par
with
some
of
belgians
best
but
i
think
it
will
make
it
to
their
level
in
time
i
got
a
few
to
age
a
total
package
craft
quad
with
impressive
flavor
and
bursting
nose
better
than
youd
believe
tm
slightly
but
only
slightly
lighter
than
some
other
quads
ive
had
nice
mildly
drying
finish
cleans
off
most
cloy
subtle
bitterness
and
spice
close
to
the
finish
dank
fruit
similar
to
the
nose
up
front
clean
up
on
the
finish
bit
of
rumfruit
cake
alcohol
warming
but
soft
busy
malt
i
could
sit
here
and
list
a
dozen
other
associated
flavors
i
like
it
one
of
the
best
from
one
of
my
least
favorite
styles
o
if
judged
as
an
american
offering
this
would
rate
higher
but
when
quads
are
the
style
i
really
started
on
and
belgium
is
where
i
started
perhaps
i
am
too
harsh
if
you
can
find
rochefort
10
st
bernardus
pannepot
or
westvletern
give
this
one
a
pass
for
the
price
though
it
has
its
niche
o
it
aint
rochefort
10
thats
for
damn
sure
but
thats
slighting
this
one
far
too
much
im
enjoying
sipping
one
of
these
its
a
great
american
take
on
a
quad
at
the
very
least
pours
a
deep
rich
clear
amber
with
a
nice
head
that
does
a
good
job
of
lasting
and
lacing
pepper
dried
fruit
and
belgian
esters
dominate
the
nose
the
body
has
all
sorts
of
interesting
stuff
going
on
raisins
sweet
caramel
earthy
bitterness
black
pepper
more
dried
fruit
yum
bitterness
keeps
the
residual
sweetness
in
check
average
carbonation
for
the
style
a
solid
beer
worth
having
again

the

comes

up
very

but
quads
are
one
of
my
favorite
styles
i
would
definitely
drink
this
again
overall
4

this
is
one
masterfully
engineered
beer
a
heady
heady
brew
that
is
beautiful
to
look
at
packs
a
ton
of
flavor
and
does
a
stellar
job
of
honoring
belgian
brewing
traditions
excellent
in
every
way
o
a
solid
quad
d
very
drinkable
nice
balanced
quad
good
balance
of
sweet
flavors
and
belgian
yeast
character
and
body
impressive
and
seems
greater
than
the
sum
of
its
parts
which
are
formidable
to
begin
with
a
lucky
grab
at
yokes
while
i
was
stocking
up
on
ipas
worth
seeking
out
actually
quite
drinkable
for
a
quad
i
would
gladly
have
another
poured
a
very
light
colour
for
a
quad
this
is
only
my
second
or
third
quad
but
i
know
the
colour
is
supposed
to
be
darker
its
sort
of
a
yellowish
red
the
head
was
enormous
for
such
a
highalcohol
beer
im
not
sure
how
it
was
possible
i
had
trouble
pouring
it
gently
enough
to
get
a
decent
amount
of
liquid
in
my
glass
without
it
foaming
over
im
fast
becoming
a
fan
of
quads
perfect
for
someone
who
likes
the
high
alcohol
and
intense
flavour
of
trippels
but
dislikes
coriander
this
one
is
pretty
good
but
it
is
not
as
good
as
the
last
one
i
had
the
reverend
sorry
to
get
so
personal
in
my
reviews
but
i
like
to
give
as
useful
a
review
as
possible
by
giving
my
background
in
the
style
this
one
is
just
a
bit
too
bitter
and
dry
for
a
quad
it
tastes
like
its
been
dryhopped
from
what
ive
read
i
dont
feel
like
this
is
the
idea
of
a
quad
the
last
quad
i
had
was
much
better
balanced
this
one
is
quite
good
as
well
but
not
at
the
same
level
a
really
good
quad
doesnt
need
as
much
spicing
as
this
one
has
in
my
opinion
but
then
again
my
opinion
is
truly
a
humble
one
im
a
total
noob
to
the
style
so
take
that
with
a
grain
of
salt
originally
reviewed
09112011
presentation
poured
from
a
12oz
bottle
into
the
tulip
glass
that
came
in
the
gift
set
o
okay
you
want
me
to
rate
a
belgian
quad
this
is
an
ever
crowded
class
with
the
best
of
the
best
i
enjoyed
this
one
and
will
definately
enjoy
another
and
maybe
one
more
after
that
but
thats
my
limit
o
this
is
an
elegant
and
subtle
quad
definitely
not
as
bold
as
others
ive
tried
but
very
well
made
and
easy
to
drink
overall
this
is
a
good
beer
but
the
nose
and
flavors
are
a
little
too
mild
compared
to
its
belgian
cousins
its
lacking
that
bold
spiciness
as
well
good
stuff
but
cant
compete
with
the
homeland
cheers
again
for
sharing
dr
doops
o
a
worthy
quad
very
tasty
a
bit
thinner
than
i
prefer
but
still
a
smooth
drinker
let
it
warm
for
maximum
taste
this
beer
deserves
the
best
i
recommend
the
sounds
of
charlie
parkers
movie
soundtrack
the
bird
or
else
count
basie
the
atomic
basie
if
you
want
a
little
more
swing
but
kansas
city
all
the
way
how
about
even
pairing
it
with
karryn
allisons
from
paris
to
rio
shes
been
a
kc
perennial
in
the
kc
jazz
scene
overall
a
little
different
from
other
quads
i
have
had
i
like
that
it
is
less
sweet
but
its
a
little
too
simple
overall
an
ok
quad
its
kind
of
sweet
with
rather
sharp
alcohol
outstanding
beer
as
all
the
smokestack
series
have
been
i
got
a
120z
bottle
of
this
for
less
than
3
bucks
what
a
deal
pours
into
a
thick
stemmed
chalice
a
deep
mahogany
color
with
brown
and
red
forces
combining
in
stunning
beauty
a
thick
tan
head
comprised
of
very
large
bubbles
rests
casually
on
top
smells
very
rich
caramel
toffee
belgian
yeast
brown
sugar
and
raisins
are
all
involved
in
a
very
complex
aromatic
experience
flavor
is
amazing
too
for
awhile
i
was
thinking
fruits
like
figs
or
dates
as
the
label
suggests
it
really
does
have
that
dried
sweet
middle
eastern
fruits
kind
of
flavor
going
on
but
it
also
tastes
very
similar
to
those
bitohoney
candies
you
still
see
around
sometimes
very
very
intriguing
and
delicious
intoxicating
as
hell
at
10
5
and
so
yummy
be
careful
this
is
a
sipper
despite
its
down
easy
feel
carbonation
is
medium
but
takes
on
a
very
laid
back
characteristic
medium
body
is
perfect
its
sweet
in
the
finish
and
warm
from
the
alcohol
but
not
unpleasant
in
either
sense
this
is
one
of
the
best
american
quads
ive
ever
had
really
overall
this
is
a
good
beer
overall
a
little
outside
my
comfort
zone
but
still
a
solid
offering
like
i
said
its
probably
the
most
appealing
looking
beer
ive
ever
poured
its
looks
are
downright
impressive
and
the
rest
of
the
drinking
experience
is
good
too
id
recommend
it
and
drink
it
again
although
i
wouldnt
likely
buy
it
again
o
a
good
solid
quad
that
was
flavorful
and
easy
to
drink
thanks
for
sharing
dan
overall
this
is
a
tough
one
to
pin
down
i
enjoyed
it
but
for
some
reason
i
wanted
to
like
it
even
more
still
an
enjoyable
if
slightly
unconventional
quad
o
one
of
the
best
quads
i
have
had
and
easily
in
the
top
3
americanproduced
a
musttry
this
would
be
a
staple
in
my
fridge
if
i
lived
in
kc
meh
very
onenoted
missing
the
dark
fruit
and
dark
candy
notes
tasty
but
the
bodys
off
you
would
never
guess
it
is
10
5
alcohol
very
complex
nice
flavor
o
this
beer
is
fine
nothing
special
but
nothing
wrong
with
it
to
call
it
a
quad
and
compare
it
to
belgians
is
a
joke
but
its
a
fine
beer
cheers
o
pretty
good
no
st
bernardus
but
tasty
nonetheless
the
flavor
too
has
some
nice
malty
caramel
along
with
some
subtle
dark
fruit
and
a
hint
of
candy
sugar
a
bit
of
clove
as
well
as
green
apple
also
sit
on
the
palate
a
nip
of
spicy
yeast
dryly
finishes
things
up
not
bad
all
in
all
surprisingly
my
first
boulevard
bier
prosit
1448
this
is
pretty
good
i
would
drink
again
due
be
careful
i
did
not
catch
the
alcohol
content
when
i
purchased
this
one
and
it
was
quite
the
relaxer
as
i
just
kept
drinking
due
to
the
malty
sweetness
o
was
a
change
up
in
taste
and
texture
from
similiar
quads
but
pleasing
to
grab
something
different
good
tweener
or
getting
ready
to
go
beer
to
liven
the
taste
buds
and
set
the
mind
for
having
some
fun
overall
best
american
attempt
at
a
quad
that
ive
tried
so
far
a
solid
beer
dates
and
raisins
again
provide
the
sweetness
cheesy
funkiness
and
some
slight
boozy
flavors
not
much
complexity
but
still
a
very
rewarding
beer
overall
for
a
beer
that
is
complex
in
taste
it
manages
to
come
together
very
well
to
top
it
all
off
it
goes
down
very
easy
as
well
id
recommend
this
to
any
craft
beer
lover
or
to
any
beer
lover
in
general
pours
a
dark
red
with
a
brownish
hue
nice
white
head
very
sweet
aroma
of
malt
brown
sugar
and
dark
fruits
raisin
fig
paired
with
the
yeast
very
sweet
taste
as
youd
expect
from
the
style
raisin
figs
some
brown
sugar
coated
banana
some
breadiness
and
alcohol
medium
bodied
to
this
and
active
from
the
carbonation
a
nice
quad
but
its
a
style
of
beer
that
i
generally
find
too
sweet
and
this
is
no
exception
o
a
very
approachable
beer
for
the
abv
i
was
drinking
this
easy
its
a
find
representation
of
a
quad
imo
poured
from
12oz
bottle
to
snifter
what
a
brilliant
color
a
bright
glossy
ruby
with
a
finger
and
a
half
of
offwhite
to
tan
head
after
an
aggressive
pour
good
lacing
light
needlepoint
beading
nose
is
stuffed
with
delicious
belgian
yeast
soft
citrus
and
pungent
floral
sweet
bread
refreshingly
light
and
approachable
for
a
quad
all
the
highlights
of
the
nose
carry
through
to
the
taste
buds
with
the
addition
of
a
subtle
licorice
presence
and
clove
really
enjoy
this
beer
its
far
less
invasive
than
most
true
belgian
quads
but
still
complex
and
intriguing
the
feel
is
appropriate
overall
this
is
a
unique
take
on
the
style
while
still
being
true
to
its
origins
well
done
o
very
good
quad
had
nice
sweet
malt
breadiness
and
dark
fruit
without
the
dry
metallic
yeast
notes
like
some
others
have
reevaluated
january
2015
mediocre
at
best
for
a
quad
thin
and
harsh
from
a
12
oz
bottle
i
feel
like
this
has
suffered
a
lot
since
the
brand
changed
ownership
ratings
adjusted
overall
quads
are
not
my
favorite
style
and
i
tend
to
not
like
my
beer
tasting
too
much
like
alcohol
but
i
am
nitpicking
despite
really
tasting
the
abv
this
is
a
top
notch
beer
that
is
tasty
and
smooth
and
looks
pretty
in
the
glass
egeszsegedre
o
i
am
a
sucker
for
quads
and
this
beer
hits
the
spot
it
has
so
many
flavors
that
just
explode
on
the
palate
and
all
the
other
aspects
of
the
beer
come
together
to
make
this
great
i
am
glad
i
can
get
this
anytime
because
it
never
gets
old
note
the
10
5
abv
is
too
much
i
dislike
this
factor
ive
drank
half
now
and
am
buzzing
not
too
awesome
notes
inside
and
out
a
great
beer
and
rather
drinkable
despite
its
10
5
abv
cheers
overall
very
well
rounded
and
a
great
sipper
quite
dry
and
complex
booze
is
well
concealed
but
makes
its
presence
known
on
the
aftertaste
o
priced
right
not
super
drinkable
but
an
excellent
dinner
beer
to
have
on
the
reg
pours
a
hazy
deep
amber
to
orangeish
color
withh
a
tan
head
in
the
aroma
sweet
dark
fruit
and
a
bit
of
alcohol
in
the
taste
licorice
dark
fruit
a
small
sweetness
to
dryness
and
a
alcohol
note
all
the
way
through
an
alcohol
bite
and
a
medium
bodied
mouthfeel
with
a
dry
small
licorice
and
alcohol
like
aftertaste
quite
muted
flavors
but
nice
flavors
and
a
mellow
alcohol
throughout
this
poured
out
as
a
nice
looking
brown
color
with
a
light
tan
head
on
top
the
smell
of
the
beer
has
a
sweetness
to
it
along
with
some
fruity
essences
on
the
nose
the
taste
of
the
beer
had
a
sweet
dark
malty
flavor
with
some
of
the
belgian
sugars
doing
their
thing
as
well
as
the
dark
fermented
fruit
flavors
the
mouthfeel
of
the
beer
was
creamy
with
a
good
carbonation
to
it
overall
i
wouldnt
say
its
my
favorite
quad
its
good
but
not
really
one
that
i
would
rave
about
i
would
drink
it
again
though
o
best
american
quad
ive
had
yet
really
solid
appearance
is
redbrown
with
an
offwhite
head
its
nose
has
caramel
dark
fruits
brown
sugar
and
raisins
a
fairly
typical
aroma
for
a
quad
the
taste
is
sweet
malts
alcohol
more
of
the
raisins
and
caramel
mouthfeel
is
medium
with
a
sweetness
that
lingers
all
in
all
a
pretty
good
beer
a
nice
attempt
at
a
quad
from
a
us
brewer
overall
a
nice
beverage
overall
this
is
a
very
nice
example
of
the
style
this
is
one
of
the
best
american
quads
ive
had
o
good
cheap
and
tasty
as
long
as
it
is
not
compared
to
the
belgians
pours
a
ruby
brown
with
minimal
head
smells
strongly
of
spiced
plum
brown
sugar
fresh
french
bread
and
cranberry
tastes
has
a
muddled
start
that
opens
up
to
more
plum
stewed
grape
and
candi
sugar
semidense
mouthfeel
rounds
out
a
near
perfect
example
of
an
americanized
quad
this
beers
pretty
good
a
netter
head
retention
is
the
only
thing
its
missing
but
that
might
not
even
be
stylistically
accurate
o
good
quad
havent
had
many
boulevard
beers
as
i
think
they
are
new
to
mass
but
look
forward
to
trying
more
o
one
of
the
better
american
quads
ive
had
i
wish
the
alcohol
presence
was
toned
down
just
a
bit
but
this
is
very
enjoyable
overall
i
recommend
this
beer
as
a
nice
u
s
take
on
the
quad
and
especially
good
for
the
4
pack
price
as
compared
to
rochefort
very
sweet
candied
dark
fruit
with
alcohol
not
subtle
or
complex
but
not
bad
i
like
it
one
of
the
better
domestic
versions
of
this
revered
style
and
a
pretty
decent
value
overall
id
visit
this
one
again
o
one
of
my
go
to
quads
drinkability
is
excellent
and
it
is
very
versatile
whether
paired
with
food
or
just
smooth
sippin
overall
this
is
a
good
quad
a
rich
and
potent
quad
that
should
definitely
be
split
between
two
people
o
a
surprisingly
good
american
quad
its
a
bit
light
in
color
and
lacks
some
comexity
but
they
nail
the
attenuation
for
a
dangerously
drinkable
beer
the
captain
strongly
recommends
this
in
moderation
taste
starts
out
with
a
peppery
spice
kick
which
is
melded
with
caramel
malt
and
some
candied
sugar
bit
of
banana
in
the
aftertaste
carbonation
is
on
the
high
side
and
is
a
bit
distracting
but
is
typical
for
a
quad
alcohol
is
very
well
hidden
i
wish
i
could
find
this
stuff
anywhere
because
its
excellent
an
improvement
on
most
authentic
belgian
quads
the
mouthfeel
was
full
bodied
and
smooth
alcohol
prickle
appearance
has
a
cloudy
amber
color
supporting
a
fine
thick
head
leaving
little
lace
smell
of
rich
caramel
prunes
raisons
having
a
slight
buttery
note
taste
follows
the
aroma
with
the
caramel
dark
fruits
with
a
peppery
spice
that
balance
with
the
hops
mouthfeel
is
medium
with
a
good
spike
of
carbonation
a
good
quad
but
nothing
to
exiting
d
this
was
a
decent
quad
but
not
very
refined
and
far
from
a
trappist
brew
the
scent
and
taste
were
ok
and
the
body
was
good
enough
but
the
alcohol
was
hot
so
it
must
be
sipped
not
sure
if
age
would
help
but
it
couldnt
hurt
not
a
must
have
beer
the
appearance
was
very
nicerobust
orange
turbid
colornice
foamy
top
that
hung
around
a
good
effervescent
aroma
of
fruitsfollowed
by
robust
malts
the
taste
is
very
similarmy
only
complaint
is
maybe
too
much
lemon
im
still
a
nooband
this
beer
is
above
me
to
criticize
its
simply
great
to
my
simple
senses
id
guess
an
import
o
very
nice
quad
just
seems
that
such
a
big
beer
10
5
should
have
a
fuller
body
that
is
my
only
complaint
an
exceptional
beer
id
have
guessed
this
to
be
a
true
belgian
had
i
not
know
where
it
was
brewed
absolutely
nothing
wrong
with
this
beer
nothing
to
even
nitpick
about
overall
i
enjoyed
that
even
with
the
high
alcohol
content
the
beer
didnt
taste
like
alcohol
the
alcohol
blended
in
with
the
spices
well
and
i
really
enjoyed
the
tickling
in
my
mouth
from
the
carbonation
i
am
new
to
the
quadrupel
style
of
beer
but
if
this
is
true
to
the
style
i
quite
enjoy
it
and
would
definitely
drink
this
beer
again
very
woody
the
sweetness
is
on
the
lips
as
you
sip
but
it
tends
toward
a
dry
alcoholic
intensity
the
aroma
is
very
beguiling
caramel
apples
and
brandy
more
than
a
slight
oxidized
taste
batch
number
58312
so
this
must
be
from
early
2010
overall
it
is
decent
but
not
as
good
as
other
quads
i
have
had
a
richer
malt
body
would
improve
things
in
my
mind
pours
a
one

fades
quickly

a

o
nothing
world
class
but
a
very
nice
example
of
the
style
esters
a
bit
high
for
my
liking
but
not
unpleasant
d
a
great
quad
typically
not
my
style
but
this
is
purely
delicious
nice
traditional
belgian
quad
done
by
an
american
brewery
this
really
seems
to
come
across
with
a
lot
of
the
authentic
traits
one
would
expect
all
the
way
through
almost
great
boulevard
can
crank
out
some
execellant
belgian
style
beers
in
the
midwest
this
is
a
wonderful
beer
its
complex
flavors
liven
the
senses
just
as
quickly
as
the
large
amounts
of
alcohol
numbs
them
this
beers
head
is
as
short
as
a
marines
hair
cut
reporting
for
duty
it
leads
the
charge
to
battle
beer
boredom
an
initial
blast
of
freshness
and
hops
as
the
hops
fizzle
away
the
tongue
relishes
in
rich
caramel
oak
cherries
and
ale
every
sips
swings
between
fresh
and
light
and
rich
and
smooth
the
aroma
is
great
but
it
is
not
strong
another
winner
from
kansas
city
how
can
you
not
like
a
quad
that
is
packed
with
fruit
isnt
overly
fizzy
or
belchy
doesnt
overpower
with
yeasty
booze
has
a
subtle
taste
of
almonds
and
goes
down
well
with
an
obscene
fistful
of
nestle
chocolate
chips
the
alcohol
is
well
hidden
and
doesnt
make
it
impossible
to
sightread
schubert
song
transcriptions
at
the
piano
well
worth
the
cost
overall
if
you
like
the
taste
of
pear
you
should
love
this
as
it
is
about
as
pronounced
here
as
in
any
beer
i
have
had
i
like
how
the
bread
and
other
flavors
interact
with
it
this
ranks
right
up
there
with
the
best
domestic
quads
i
will
get
this
again
overall
a
fairly
sugary
beer
that
screams
dessert
very
nice
to
curl
up
with
and
enjoy
a
movie
at
the
same
time
this
is
an
excellent
take
on
the
style
the
nose
is
pretty
unique
and
both
the
nose
and
the
taste
have
a
lighter
fruit
feel
than
most
quads
its
pretty
complex
and
changes
as
it
warms
definitely
a
beer
that
id
like
to
see
down
the
road
with
some
time
on
it
d
a
little
too
much
sweet
and
canned
fruit
combo
for
me
but
solid
i
have
enjoyed
the
smokestack
offerings
i
have
tried
i
love
this
beer
rochefort
810
and
sixth
glass
quad
my
tops
if
boulevard
could
tone
down
the
booze
and
maintain
the
rest
of
this
beer
id
float
my
boat
much
more
buoyantly
o
im
not
going
to
be
finishing
this
one
i
knew
that
this
style
was
not
my
favorite
but
this
really
is
not
as
wonderful
as
i
thought
it
might
be
a
few
sips
made
me
think
oh
ok
maybe
this
is
pretty
good
however
the
bitterness
and
imaging
have
turned
me
off
o
goes
down
easy
tasty
not
filling
well
hidden
kick
nice
representation
of
style
not
one
of
my
favorite
styles
but
this
is
a
well
balanced
and
tasty
beer
that
could
have
more
than
one
of
overall
somewhat
enjoyable
i
dont
think
i
will
buy
it
again
not
bad
just
not
for
me
o
easy
to
drink
quite
tasty
not
too
sweet
will
look
for
more
cheers
d
would
get
this
again
one
of
the
best
quads
ive
had
in
a
long
time
very
impressed
mouthfeel
perfect
for
my
liking
not
as
heavy
as
a
belgium
quads
often
are
overall
i
think
this
is
an
average
quad
not
terribly
priced
though
at
9
a
fourpack
dont
know
if
i
can
find
a
better
quad
for
less
medium
mouthfeel
with
only
a
slight
notice
of
the
alcohol
didnt
expect
a
quad
this
good
from
boulevard
but
the
smokestack
series
scores
again
big
thanks
goes
out
to
my
boy
cassino
for
giving
me
this
one
as
he
saw
i
had
never
ticked
it
thanks
buddy
served
from
bottle
into
a
trappistes
rochefort
chalice
poured
red
brown
with
a
one
finger
offwhite
head
that
subsided
to
half
a
finger
quickly
maintained
excellent
lacing
throughout
the
glass
the
aroma
was
comprised
of
sweet
malt
bread
fruit
dark
fruit
banana
and
subtle
sweet
alcohol
the
flavor
was
of
sweet
malt
bread
banana
dark
fruit
sweet
alcohol
and
fig
it
had
a
medium
feel
on
the
palate
with
mediumhigh
carbonation
overall
this
was
a
pretty
good
brew
the
complexity
on
this
one
was
quite
nice
and
kept
me
going
back
for
more
my
only
gripe
on
this
one
was
that
the
alcohol
definitely
let
itself
be
known
throughout
while
this
didnt
kill
the
enjoyment
of
this
brew
by
any
means
i
wish
it
would
have
been
toned
down
just
a
touch
and
been
replaced
with
more
dark
fruit
notes
a
definite
must
try
ill
stick
the
the
original
kings
of
quads
here
the
belgians
make
a
better
quad
this
is
however
a
very
clean
and
easy
to
drink
cheaper
alternative
this
is
an
easy
drinking
beer
with
a
descent
flavor
could
use
more
bitterness
to
balance
out
the
sweetness
o
a
pleasant
surprise
i
was
not
expecting
something
this
amazing
from
a
9
bottle
very
very
drinkable
not
sure
if
it
gets
much
better
than
this
overall
some
of
the
sharp
citrus
mellows
as
it
warms
but
begins
to
taste
rather
flat
really
good
appearance
but
lacking
in
the
taste
department
o
its
not
bad
something
about
the
taste
didnt
leave
my
mouth
right
tasted
a
bit
artificial
and
harsh
not
a
bad
beer
though
but
not
great
o
i
thought
this
was
a
good
beer
unsure
if
id
buy
it
again
but
it
is
nice
poured
in
a
snifter
glass
shows
a
deep
copper
color
with
a
smallish
tightly
bubbled
white
head
that
shows
moderate
retention
smells
of
brown
sugar
and
candied
dark
fruits
mostly
with
a
hint
of
pepper
and
spicy
yeast
taste
is
sweet
candied
fruit
and
brown
sugar
mixed
with
a
bit
of
pepper
yeast
and
ethanol
goodness
medium
to
thick
body
spirited
level
of
carbonation
sweet
bubbly
mouthfeel
overall
finally
a
solid
american
quad
i
can
relate
to
well
o
this
was
a
reall
incredible
brew
im
a
big
fan
of
this
style
and
i
think
this
one
is
a
homerun
my
biggest
concern
is
that
this
one
might
gave
just
passed
ommegang
three
philosophers
which
has
a
particularlly
important
place
in
my
heart
great
style
great
brew
well
done
i
enjoyed
this
beer
much
more
the
first
time
i
had
it
it
seems
much
thinner
than
i
remember
i
think
quad
i
think
syrupy
fruits
definitely
some
of
my
alltime
favorite
bottle
art
though
o
this
beer
has
some
nice
fruit
estery
flavors
with
some
good
caramel
character
but
there
is
a
brassy
wheatwine
bite
that
just
doesnt
taste
right
im
hoping
age
will
help
this
mellow
as
i
think
it
is
close
to
being
a
great
beer
but
now
i
just
think
it
is
a
bit
odd
a
deep
amber
hue
some
slight
cloudyness
and
a
humongous
head
bring
this
beer
as
a
feast
for
the
eyes
smells
of
sweet
yeats
spent
grain
lemons
and
grapefruits
hit
the
nose
a
palate
is
built
of
belgian
candy
belgian
yeast
andblack
spicy
pepper
but
unfortunately
the
spicy
alcohol
seems
to
dominate
an
otherwise
fantastic
quad
medium
body
very
warm
and
a
heavily
carbonated
brew
gives
the
mouth
a
lt
to
take
are
of
i
like
it
i
would
have
it
again
most
likely
split
with
a
buddy
do
this
americanbrewed
quadrupel
hits
a
number
of
authentic
notes
proficiently
yet
it
is
only
really
comforting
and
enjoyable
in
the
finish
however
late
flavors
leave
a
strong
impression
making
it
become
more
compelling
as
the
glass
is
emptied
it
volunteers
for
duty
against
complex
spicy
food
such
as
indian
which
is
consistent
for
abbeystyle
strong
ales
this
comes
across
like
a
beer
that
has
been
blended
with
a
aperitif
like
a
cognac
the
swallow
is
of
white
pepper
very
high
carbonation
while
the
body
is
nearly
oily
alcohol
is
also
strong
leaving
warmth
in
the
belly
given
that
st
bernardus
is
roughly
the
same
price
this
is
quite
a
tough
sell
an
inferior
quad
and
an
unfortunate
miss
from
boulevard
verdict
really
top
notch
belgian
quad
this
is
my
first
beer
from
boulevard
and
it
will
certainly
be
a
place
to
remember
one
of
the
best
american
quads
ive
had
and
rivals
many
that
come
from
belgium
full
bodied
and
chewy
a
mouth
coater
wonderful
to
drink
but
the
alcohol
will
bite
you
a
great
version
of
the
style
pours
a
deep
copper
color
with
a
smallish
tightly
bubbled
white
head
that
shows
moderate
retention
smells
of
brown
sugar
and
candied
dark
fruits
mostly
with
a
hint
of
pepper
and
spicy
yeast
taste
is
sweet
candied
fruit
and
brown
sugar
mixed
with
a
bit
of
pepper
yeast
and
ethanol
medium
to
thick
body
spirited
level
of
carbonation
sweet
bubbly
mouthfeel
i
liked
this
a
lot
it
smells
and
tastes
wonderful
that
said
i
would
have
like
it
a
bit
lighter
on
the
carbonation
o
a
solid
quad
very
drinkable
for
the
style
but
it
is
certainly
a
beer
you
could
open
up
and
drink
throughout
the
night
as
well
kind
of
starts
off
a
bit
harsh
but
ends
up
balancing
out
decently
with
warmth
i
think
it
is
a
bit
alcohol
heavy
and
somewhat
medicinal
although
not
enough
to
call
it
a
wasted
effort
a
pretty
big
quadrupel
with
some
refinement
issues
overall
its
a
good
quad
pretty
solid
stuff
lots
of
complexity
overall
wow
boulevard
has
done
it
again
with
their
smokestack
series
i
love
thier
tank
7
sasion
and
i
really
love
this
quad
an
excellent
american
interpretation
of
the
style
and
pretty
close
to
the
belgian
trappist
versions
of
this
style
and
thats
quite
a
compliment
will
buy
and
drink
this
one
again
for
sure
doesnt
come
close
to
matching
the
belgian
greats
of
the
style
but
good
for
an
american
interpretation
certainly
one
of
the
easier
drinking
quads
ive
had
and
at
less
than
312
oz
its
a
good
deal
nice
carbonation
and
creamy
chewy
body
quite
an
alcohol
kick
im
a
fan
of
this
brew
not
quite
on
the
same
level
as
my
love
for
the
bbq
but
very
close
this
guy
stacks
up
quite
nicely
with
any
belgian
quad
the
taste
is
solid
although
not
as
world
class
as
i
think
some
give
it
credit
for
maleness
hits
you
right
away
with
a
somewhat
chewy
bread
pudding
note
that
follows
and
finally
a
rush
of
carbonation
finishes
you
off
not
bad
o
overall
this
beer
was
very
awesome
i
had
some
of
the
smokestack
series
before
and
im
looking
forward
to
rating
the
rest
including
the
collaboration
with
deschutes
this
is
a
nice
american
made
example
of
a
quad
i
prefer
a
la
trappe
quad
which
has
more
sweetness
but
this
is
one
hell
of
a
complex
brew
drinking
it
i
could
swear
this
is
barrel
aged
but
i
guess
not
boulevard
really
cranks
out
some
quality
beers
and
this
one
is
no
exception
not
to
mention
the
price
point
is
solid
as
well
overall
a
never
good
quad
easily
one
of
the
better
american
renditions
ive
come
across
but
naturally
falls
short
of
the
belgian
archetypes
the
rocheforts
and
westvleterens
of
the
world
would
like
to
try
the
barrel
aged
version
bbq
when
its
released
o
this
beer
is
very
good
but
it
is
not
perfect
it
seems
to
be
a
bit
too
agressive
usually
i
find
quads
to
be
a
little
more
subtle
than
this
on
the
other
hand
how
often
do
you
find
a
quad
that
is
this
good
for
the
price
i
think
i
paid
2
85
for
the
bottle
and
thats
in
alabama
its
a
good
value
for
every
now
and
then
but
not
a
regular
brew
this
is
a
big
complex
beer
that
stands
alone
id
love
to
try
it
again
with
a
strong
smoky
cheese
or
a
creme
brulee
i
look
forward
to
it
in
a
snifter
good
job
by
boulevard
brewing
fantastic
quadruple
i
think
this
could
use
a
bit
more
age
on
it
as
the
flavors
were
still
a
tad
on
the
raw
side
but
still
well
done
not
long
ago
while
perusing
the
beer
selection
at
a
local
liquor
emporium
i
decided
to
give
this
one
a
shot
8
for
a
750
arriving
home
i
cracked
it
open
quite
a
chore
and
poured
it
into
a
tulip
poured
a
slightly
hazy
burnt
orange
color
with
a
good
beige
head
aromas
of
brown
sugar
dark
fruit
and
sweet
caramel
on
the
palate
this
one
was
medium
to
full
bodied
with
flavors
of
dark
fruits
candi
sugar
caramel
and
booze
medium
body
and
nice
stickiness
just
faint
warming
i
would
have
liked
just
a
tad
less
carbonation
but
its
not
bad
these
guys
do
some
nice
stuff
pretty
good
american
version
pours
a
amber
brown
with
a
1
finger
head
that
lasts
into
my
ccb
snifter
aroma
of
fruity
figs
and
raisins
bready
malts
with
a
heavy
yeasty
nose
taste
follows
the
nose
with
sweet
fruits
malts
and
yeast
alcohol
is
present
more
than
other
quads
but
still
fairly
smooth
i
would
love
to
try
this
in
a
corked
and
caged
750
bottle
conditioning
in
a
larger
bottle
makes
a
big
difference
o
not
as
good
as
bbq
but
very
few
beers
are
imo
this
one
is
readily
available
in
the
midwest
and
is
one
of
the
stars
in
boulevards
lineup
im
sure
ill
have
it
again
body
is
medium
for
the
style
as
it
warms
gets
a
little
more
syrupy
some
time
would
not
hurt
this
bottle
which
says
best
by
4
27
13
been
enjoying
my
trip
through
boulevards
offerings
seeing
as
theyre
now
all
over
the
place
here
in
the
chicago
burbs
which
means
im
lookin
forward
to
this
one
it
pours
a
clear
garnetruby
topped
by
a
finger
of
tan
foam
the
nose
comprises
fig
rye
bread
red
apple
skin
light
raspberry
black
pepper
nutmeg
light
cocoa
powder
and
toffee
the
taste
holds
notes
of
caramel
rye
bread
black
pepper
fig
light
plum
light
strawberry
red
grapes
and
a
light
sprinkling
of
chocolate
powder
the
body
is
a
strong
medium
with
a
light
moderate
carbonation
and
a
sorta
syrupy
feel
overall
a
very
nice
quad
one
that
deftly
balances
the
bready
sweet
and
fruity
characters
very
well
overall
10
99
for
a
four
pack
and
it
is
worth
it
the
body
and
flavor
are
both
wellbalanced
many
subtle
flavors
at
work
its
really
a
fantastic
beer
o
to
be
honest
its
a
pretty
good
try
at
the
elusive
quad
but
not
at
the
level
of
the
real
thing
perhaps
this
ones
past
its
prime
or
not
there
yet
it
really
does
have
a
champion
nose
but
doesnt
quite
live
up
to
it
got
it
in
a
random
trade
so
i
cant
comment
on
the
value
comes
out
of
the
bottle
a
pretty
and
very
inviting
clear
coppery
redbrown
with
a
nice
light
tan
head
that
is
none
too
persistent
malty
aroma
has
a
strong
spicy
undertone
mainly
cinnamon
and
cloves
and
quite
appealing
with
just
a
touch
of
caramel
texture
is
fizzy
dancing
on
the
tongue
and
leaving
a
fairly
persistent
fizz
on
a
malty
caramel
finish
look
for
this
one
note
to
prospective
tasters
the
fourpack
of
twelveounce
bottles
at
9
99
seems
a
far
better
buy
than
the
twentytwo
ounce
bomber
at
8
99
however
the
bomber
with
its
caged
cork
makes
an
elegant
presentation
for
a
special
occasion
o
very
solid
rep
of
the
style
quality
shit
meng
o
overall
an
above
average
quad
i
think
with
a
few
more
months
on
it
it
could
have
been
even
better
would
like
to
have
it
again
do
good
middle
of
the
road
quad
widely
available
pushes
this
over
the
edge
with
me
thank
you
boulevard
for
the
smokestack
series
o
i
think
this
is
a
fine
quad
and
am
sort
of
regretting
not
having
picked
up
another
one
it
will
age
well
i
suspect
and
once
the
heat
is
died
down
a
bit
itll
be
real
good
overall
i
find
i
am
greatly
enjoying
this
beer
i
had
some
misgivings
at
first
because
of
the
aroma
but
was
pleasantly
surprised
thereafter
a
good
brew
o
this
is
a
great
beer
glad
i
picked
it
up
would
buy
this
one
again
for
sure
o
all
in
all
this
is
a
nice
and
drinkable
quad
but
fairly
light
and
really
doesnt
compare
to
others
in
the
style
overall
extremely
well
made
quad
that
further
proves
how
well
boulevard
can
nail
the
appearance
and
mouthfeel
of
belgian
beers
most
us
craft
brewers
fail
at
these
aspects
i
just
wish
it
was
a
little
less
sweet
d
really
a
nice
quad
that
is
very
flavorful
and
has
a
nice
complexity
my
only
gripe
is
the
alcohol
heat
a
bit
offputting
and
it
makes
it
much
less
enjoyable
and
easy
to
drink
its
not
hot
enough
to
not
enjoy
but
its
a
bit
too
powerful
for
my
taste
other
than
that
this
is
a
really
good
quad
this
will
probably
be
better
with
some
age
so
im
going
to
revisit
it
in
a
year
or
so
overall
it
is
nice
quad
another
good
beer
from
the
smokestack
series
o
i
purchase
at
least
1
every
time
i
go
to
the
liquor
store
pairs
well
with
pretty
much
all
food
and
works
as
a
winter
ale
or
a
night
time
summer
one
when
sipped
slowly
its
also
my
go
to
beer
when
showing
why
i
like
belgians
or
abbey
ales
i
liked
this
beer
a
good
example
of
the
style
and
one
i
would
definitely
have
again
o
not
a
bad
american
interpretation
of
the
style
one
of
the
better
ones
in
america
would
love
to
see
what
some
age
can
do
with
this
o
a
good
sipper
overall
not
a
true
belgian
quad
but
not
a
bad
shot
from
a
brewery
out
of
missouri
o
very
tasty
glad
i
traded
for
it
fairly
sweet
overall
with
a
bit
heavy
carbonation
but
still
a
nice
beer
brought
to
the
beer
club
by
a
friend
definitely
a
tasty
beer
to
have
again
o
seems
like
a
good
beer
reminds
me
of
apple
cider
with
alcohol
added
definitely
nothing
saying
its
bad
might
not
be
my
style
but
still
enjoyable
sixth
glass
pours
something
in
between
maroon
and
more
of
a
brown
color
but
it
fades
to
a
clear
ruby
when
held
to
light
the
cream
colored
head
is
almost
out
of
control
more
than
four
fingers
tall
and
threatening
to
spill
out
the
glass
head
retention
is
solid
but
the
complete
lack
of
lacing
is
a
major
letdown
the
nose
is
a
bit
higher
on
peppery
phenols
as
compared
to
dark
fruits
than
usual
but
theres
also
a
nice
background
note
of
overripe
banana
that
i
dont
always
find
in
quads
the
flavor
just
cant
hang
with
the
best
of
the
style
the
most
important
thing
for
me
in
a
beer
like
this
is
to
have
a
solid
sweet
fruity
base
to
hold
the
rest
of
the
beer
together
while
there
are
certainly
notes
of
plum
and
figs
they
arent
nearly
potent
enough
to
keep
the
pepper
and
clove
yeast
notes
from
together
with
a
generous
warming
sensation
from
the
alcohol
running
roughshod
over
the
brew
the
body
ends
up
on
the
light
side
for
10
5abv
and
the
carbonation
is
middle
of
the
road
and
just
a
little
bit
dull
in
the
end
the
beer
captures
neither
the
creamy
texture
despite
a
dry
finish
nor
the
expressive
carbonation
of
a
world
class
quad
i
had
high
expectations
for
sixth
glass
having
really
enjoyed
my
previous
boulevard
offerings
including
bbq
but
this
goes
to
show
just
how
hard
brewing
a
top
notch
quad
is
cheers
overall
a
very
very
nice
american
crafted
quad
i
only
expect
this
to
smooth
out
with
some
age
as
it
approaches
its
best
by
date
and
should
hold
sturdy
even
beyond
that
have
the
other
3
bottles
in
the
cellar
and
will
probably
pick
up
some
more
at
some
point
solid
beer
and
at
a
good
price
point
all
things
considered
definitely
would
recommend
this
mouthfeel
strong
and
warming
more
of
a
wintertime
quad
syrupy
but
crisp
this
is
a
nice
beer
drinkability
is
great
not
my
favorite
style
prefer
a
good
dubblel
but
this
one
is
very
well
done
and
i
am
wishing
i
could
get
more
locally
nuff
said
if
you
see
it
buy
it
you
will
not
be
disappointed
well
worth
a
try
if
you
are
lucky
enough
to
be
in
an
area
boulevard
distributes
its
fine
beers
to
o
its
definitely
a
quad
but
its
not
quite
as
refined
as
ive
come
to
expect
from
what
is
probably
one
of
the
most
refined
and
complex
styles
going
it
went
really
well
with
my
roast
cornish
hen
for
what
its
worth
o
overall
i
think
that
this
would
greatly
benefit
from
some
time
in
the
cellar
its
a
little
hot
right
now
and
i
think
the
flavors
would
blend
better
if
it
had
a
little
age
on
it
one
of
the
better
american
quads
that
ive
tried
recently
o
tasty
and
balanced
i
could
see
myself
drinking
this
frequently
pretty
good
but
not
my
favorite
of
the
smokestack
series
o
bready
and
fruity
with
a
big
alcohol
kick
pretty
good
but
would
benefit
from
a
year
or
two
of
cellaring
o
overall
a
nice
us
quad
better
than
most
but
doesnt
hold
a
candle
to
the
flagships
d
compared
to
the
few
other
quads
ive
had
this
one
fell
way
behind
the
dark
fruits
werent
as
strong
and
drank
a
little
bitter
doubt
ill
have
another
one
unless
they
are
giving
them
away
lol
overall
a
nice
beer
the
alcohol
is
still
very
firm
but
thats
not
completely
unexpected
and
was
why
i
pulled
the
bottle
to
help
put
a
bullet
in
my
day
quads
are
good
contemplate
your
life
beers
this
one
is
doing
the
trick
overall
good
start
needs
some
improvement
dn
a
good
sipper
this
one
bottle
will
last
me
well
past
the
hour
overall
while
the
beer
is
not
the
greatest
example
of
the
style
the
flavor
is
there
and
it
is
very
enjoyable
poured
into
a
tulip
glass
this
beer
has
a
light
copperish
color
with
a
really
nice
red
tinge
on
the
edges
when
held
up
to
the
light
has
a
light
tan
head
that
was
1
5
fingers
high
left
a
light
lacing
on
the
glass
throughout
sipping
it
really
like
the
smell
on
this
one
some
dark
brown
sugar
dark
fruits
like
plum
and
a
great
smell
of
sourdough
bread
taste
follows
suit
balance
is
great
in
this
beer
the
sweetness
is
not
overwhelming
at
all
plenty
of
fruit
and
spice
and
bready
yeast
are
there
carbonation
is
well
tuned
to
keep
this
10
5
beer
fairly
light
this
is
my
first
boulevard
beer
but
it
certainly
wont
be
my
last
based
on
the
quality
of
this
beer
overall
this
is
a
very
nice
beer
i
am
happy
that
boulevard
will
be
coming
to
chicago
soon
i
want
to
get
more
of
this
one
pours
a
very
light
color
for
the
stylelight
copper
with
a
bit
of
a
reddish
hue
singlefinger
offwhite
head
starts
it
out
eventually
the
head
fades
into
a
light
collar
with
a
few
spots
of
lacing
on
the
side
of
the
glas
the
nose
has
some
faint
dark
fruits
plus
a
bit
of
lightlysweet
malt
perhaps
a
hint
of
caramel
nothing
too
complex
a
bit
of
booze
there
as
well
the
flavor
has
dark
fruits
cherries
light
alcohol
and
a
bit
of
sweet
malt
everything
melds
together
quite
well
medium
body
with
lowish
carbonation
overall
pretty
good
glad
i
got
to
try
this
o
tasty
and
quite
drinkable
for
10
5
abv
pretty
solid
quad
all
around
and
for
3
a
bottle
this
is
a
steal
there
are
better
quads
out
there
but
no
better
bang
for
the
buck
at
least
from
what
ive
had
o
a
great
beer
one
i
will
revisit
often
thank
you
boulevard
you
have
another
winner
d
better
than
i
expected
despite
the
abv
presence
it
didnt
feel
like
much
of
a
sipper
to
me
enjoyable
brew
from
boulevard
i
pour
in
the
dredges
as
promised
and
notice
a
massive
increase
in
the
breadiness
of
the
nose
very
sconelike
now
on
each
whiff
flavor
doesnt
change
as
much
but
the
nose
is
dramatic
this
is
a
very
nice
big
beer
that
i
would
probably
buy
again
if
it
were
on
the
shelves
here
and
i
was
looking
for
a
one
bottle
buzz
pours
a
beautiful
deep
hazy
amber
color
with
an
off
white
fizzy
head
the
aroma
i
get
is
mostly
yeast
the
mouthfeel
is
medium
very
carbonated
a
little
bit
of
that
creaminess
you
expect
from
belgians
but
certainly
not
as
much
as
a
trappist
the
higher
alcohol
creates
a
perception
of
bitterness
and
does
give
off
some
warmth
that
flirts
with
being
hot
the
flavor
is
suitably
complex
with
a
rounded
malt
character
figs
maybe
a
hint
of
orange
some
peppery
character
with
the
high
alcohol
you
sometimes
get
the
flavor
of
some
type
of
liquer
ive
had
quadrupels
that
have
hidden
the
alcohol
flavor
more
but
this
is
a
well
made
beer
the
appearance
and
smell
are
by
far
the
best
attributes
of
this
quad
i
had
big
hopes
that
quickly
faded
after
tasting
not
a
bad
beer
but
doesnt
match
up
with
some
of
the
belgiannetherlands
versions
pours
a
hazy
brownedorange
with
a
beautifully
thick
caramel
colored
head
and
smells
malty
and
lush
with
sourwood
honey
apricot
bread
and
white
raisin
flavors
the
palate
has
a
sweet
and
alcoholic
delivery
with
a
moderate
level
of
oily
hop
character
balancing
the
loads
of
robust
malty
sweetness
flavors
of
peach
caramel
and
black
pepper
and
a
full
and
somewhat
creamy
body
finish
is
long
with
more
of
that
peppery
spice
and
apricot
d
a
decent
quad
very
rich
and
earthy
at
the
same
time
might
need
some
time
to
mellow
out
but
i
do
wish
more
fruits
were
present
dstrong
it
is
a
quad
probably
not
a
beer
i
would
sit
and
drink
a
bottle
of
oops
oh
yes
i
did
d
started
out
strong
but
ended
short
of
perfection
as
a
whole
it
was
a
little
out
of
balance
i
found
the
alcohol
too
strong
and
not
well
integrated
fairly
drinkable
but
not
something
ill
be
returning
to
great
extra
in
a
trade
w
gcurlow
thanks
nice
robust
head
atop
a
reddish
brown
amber
beer
a
little
lighter
for
the
style
id
say
nice
retention
aromas
of
fruit
at
first
bananas
and
apple
pie
sweet
spices
sort
of
fluffy
wow
surprised
by
the
palate
here
which
is
nothing
like
i
was
expecting
from
the
nose
everything
leading
up
to
the
first
sip
was
pointing
towards
a
lighter
profile
for
a
quad
but
this
is
pretty
beefy
very
sweet
up
front
brown
sugar
and
maple
candy
caramel
some
bready
malt
undercurrents
but
really
nothing
too
out
of
the
ordinary
beyond
the
sweetness
slick
slightly
chewy
mouthfeel
i
gotta
say
this
is
the
first
blvd
beer
that
i
havent
been
totally
blown
away
with
still
a
decent
take
maybe
just
not
up
my
alley
medium
bodied
high
carbonation
sweet
and
smooth
i
like
much
about
this
beer
but
it
does
not
seem
like
it
is
true
to
style
the
10
5
abv
is
well
hidden
which
is
a
plus
i
thought
this
beer
was
very
smooth
and
had
a
good
taste
had
a
bit
of
a
fruity
taste
to
it
i
would
suggest
drinking
it
at
a
warmer
temperature
because
it
was
too
cold
straight
from
the
refrigerator
mediumbodied
with
pleasant
carbonation
the
mouthfeel
is
good
drinkability
however
is
held
back
by
the
booziness
again
id
love
to
see
what
a
bit
of
age
does
to
this
one
d
absolutely
delicious
i
highly
recommend
it
a
real
sipper
and
noticeably
alcoholic
d
very
drinkable
at
over
10
abv
it
definately
sneaks
up
on
you
wanted
another
right
away
probably
lucky
it
only
came
in
a
4
pack
d
overall
not
the
greatest
example
of
the
quad
still
an
enjoyable
drink
age
and
enjoy
drinkability
is
pretty
good
solid
quad
d
excellent
high
abv
is
the
only
downside
drinkability
speaking
d
this
beer
is
a
respectable
drinker
im
enjoying
it
enough
to
have
it
again
but
it
wouldnt
be
a
top
choice
when
in
the
mood
for
something
special
this
is
my
first
taste
of
a
smokestack
series
boulevard
brew
its
a
decent
beer
but
i
have
higher
hopes
for
some
of
their
other
offerings
this
was
my
3rd
sitting
with
the
sixth
glass
i
wanted
to
make
sure
that
my
first
impression
was
reliable
i
wouldnt
say
this
is
all
that
drinkable
as
high
abvs
usually
arent
the
perfume
and
strong
alcohol
flavors
keep
it
from
being
a
really
good
beer
its
good
but
falls
short
of
the
big
boys
its
modeled
after
perhaps
the
750ml
bottles
offer
something
more
d
unbelievably
sweet
like
zero
bittering
agents
come
forth
to
combat
the
sweet
factors
on
this
beer
it
really
starts
to
detract
on
the
drinkability
here
with
such
overwhelming
sweetness
some
quads
i
feel
i
can
drink
a
gallon
some
i
feel
a
glass
is
too
much
this
is
almost
in
that
glass
is
too
much
category
it
opens
amazing
but
it
starts
to
build
into
something
rancid
least
the
super
high
alcohol
is
well
placed
will
definitely
buy
again
very
nice
glass
full
of
darker
ale
with
a
lite
hint
of
malt
and
fruit
the
smell
gives
you
the
feeling
it
wil
be
a
very
fruit
ale
but
it
is
not
overwhelming
i
split
the
bottle
and
it
might
get
a
little
sweet
after
a
whole
bottle
overall
it
is
a
great
pour
id
buy
this
again
might
share
with
my
nohop
friends
really
nice
looking
beer
although
a
little
light
four
the
style
i
expect
deep
mahagony
and
get
deep
amber
nice
carb
nice
lacing
great
retention
aroma
is
full
of
phenol
peppery
and
spices
faint
roastyness
and
raisin
but
why
less
than
usual
flavor
is
spicy
and
peppery
there
is
some
chewy
malt
and
deep
flavor
but
i
am
missing
the
deep
dried
fruit
flavors
im
acustomed
to
plainly
put
feels
more
like
a
saison
dry
attenuated
but
well
carbed
yeah
its
quafable
but
im
not
so
sure
a
quad
should
be
i
think
its
a
tasty
beer
but
suffers
from
poor
yeast
selection
not
a
bad
beer
but
has
the
potential
to
be
so
much
better
glad
i
got
to
try
this
one
drinkable
in
a
sense
but
a
bit
too
much
alcohol
heat
not
as
bad
at
many
american
breweries
attempts
at
a
quad
when
it
comes
to
this
though
the
mouthfeel
is
slightly
heavy
and
oddly
spritzy
the
carbonation
could
stand
to
get
knocked
down
a
peg
or
two
a
bit
harsh
on
the
finish
good
full
flavors
the
booze
is
noted
at
the
first
sip
but
either
im
getting
used
to
it
or
it
wears
off
on
subsequent
sips
this
is
followed
by
dark
fruits
mild
candylike
sweetness
and
yeast
on
the
finish
this
was
a
pleasant
sipper
but
certain
aspects
could
be
tweaked
imo
not
the
best
quad
out
there
but
a
good
one
noless
d
delicious
i
would
definitely
recommend
this
the
sixth
glass
was
a
hazy
dark
amber
color
with
fine
particles
floating
throughout
it
had
a
large
beige
head
with
good
retention
and
minimal
lacing
the
smell
was
malt
yeast
aromas
and
spices
with
some
alcohol
the
taste
was
quite
fruity
with
clovelike
spices
and
some
alcohol
the
finish
was
long
dry
and
throatwarming
this
beer
was
mediumfull
in
body
with
medium
carbonation
drinkabity
was
good
poured
into
a
pint
glass
a
nice
redorange
hue
with
a
finger
of
thin
head
that
settles
into
a
loose
fringe
on
the
surface
leaving
almost
no
lacing
smell
is
sweet
fruity
and
somewhat
similar
to
a
fruit
wine
other
than
the
hint
of
malt
taste
is
initially
all
deep
fruit
and
sugar
sweet
giving
way
to
a
nice
malt
and
warm
alcohol
finish
that
cleans
up
the
sweetness
fairly
well
this
is
fairly
drinkable
for
the
abv
but
the
sweetness
begins
to
stick
around
torwards
the
end
two
would
be
enough
but
they
would
be
thoroughly
enjoyed
drinkability
yum
this
is
a
big
flavorful
and
immensely
enjoyable
beer
my
second
from
boulevard
and
a
great
comeback
from
the
disappointing
last
beer
the
drinkability
is
pretty
good
with
this
beer
this
is
a
sipping
beer
treat
it
as
so
looks
brown
until
light
reveals
a
reddish
hue
small
head
that
dies
away
quickly
aroma
is
delicate
and
inviting
with
candied
sugar
hints
of
banana
and
even
some
nuttiness
present
taste
is
simply
impressive
making
me
wonder
why
ive
waited
so
long
to
try
this
the
body
is
outstanding
i
really
cant
recall
ever
having
a
10
beer
feel
this
light
and
bubbly
kudos
to
boulevard
back
to
flavor
bread
caramel
maybe
slight
almond
bananas
milk
chocolatelots
going
on
making
it
hard
to
dissect
but
easy
to
enjoy
and
appreciate
im
really
enjoying
this
and
will
certainly
be
buying
it
again
d
worth
the
purchase
another
win
for
the
smokestack
lineup
during
the
holidays
ive
been
drinking
nothing
but
belgians
and
this
was
todays
beer
this
beer
has
a
sexy
apperance
but
is
lacking
in
mouthfeel
and
taste
it
has
a
wonderful
head
and
is
a
very
nice
dark
ruby
but
something
was
missing
when
i
tasted
it
opinion
this
is
a
very
well
crafted
beer
i
may
have
had
this
beer
for
6
months
and
it
has
held
up
perfectly
it
doesnt
quite
have
the
sheer
malt
complexity
that
some
of
the
belgian
greats
have
but
it
is
something
to
be
said
that
i
am
comparing
this
beer
to
the
likes
of
st
bernardus
or
koeningshoeven
i
am
very
impressed
with
the
overall
flavor
and
presentation
of
this
beer
it
is
of
worldclass
quality
and
i
would
definitely
recommend
it
my
hats
off
to
the
guys
at
boulevard
for
this
exceptional
brew
this
is
the
best
beer
ive
had
from
boulevard
and
i
would
have
to
say
its
one
of
the
better
beers
ive
tasted
as
of
today
with
10
5
abv
it
was
not
to
strong
as
compared
to
others
with
the
same
abv
it
is
a
well
balanced
beer
which
i
poured
out
of
the
bottle
into
a
goblet
at
around
45
degrees
great
taste
very
drinkable
and
a
great
all
around
beer
smokestack
is
no
joke
and
this
is
no
exception
drinkability
quite
good
pretty
easydrinking
for
a
quad
and
great
aroma
which
made
the
taste
a
bit
of
a
letdown
clearly
an
americanized
quadrupel
but
still
really
tasty
absolutely
trying
at
least
once
plus
the
price
is
right
drink
i
could
do
another
one
even
at
the
10
5
these
12oz
bottles
could
do
some
damage
in
a
4
pack
notes
a
bit
above
average
quad
not
bad
but
alcohol
was
a
little
strong
i
enjoyed
drinking
it
but
i
wasnt
blown
away
by
it
d
another
whopper
of
a
beer
the
sixth
glass
is
a
thinkpiece
about
a
midlevel
beer
struggling
with
its
own
limitations
in
the
harsh
face
of
stardom
almost
famous
indeed
this
is
my
first
review
so
bare
with
me
here
first
off
the
bottle
a
750ml
is
quite
impressive
the
overall
feel
of
what
you
are
getting
yourself
into
can
be
felt
by
the
great
design
of
the
bottle
to
the
beer
absolutely
brilliant
it
was
a
great
drink
and
went
down
very
well
mouthfeel
was
again
exceptional
the
taste
well
it
hit
all
the
right
buds
and
at
10
5
drinking
the
whole
thing
in
one
setting
definitely
got
me
buzzed
boulevards
the
sixth
glass
should
be
on
anybodys
short
list
of
beers
to
try
d
pretty
enjoyable
although
i
wouldnt
drink
a
lot
of
this
at
once
the
750ml
bottle
is
something
to
share
with
friends
not
to
drink
alone
mouth
feel
is
just
about
perfect
great
level
of
carbonation
and
the
medium
body
is
exactly
what
i
would
expect
from
a
quad
this
is
one
insanely
drinkable
beer
it
certainly
doesnt
feel
like
10
5
while
drinking
it
is
very
easy
to
down
the
whole
bottle
very
quickly
but
it
is
probably
a
good
idea
to
take
your
time
and
enjoy
d
the
bommer
is
tough
to
put
down
in
a
single
sitting
great
to
share
the
high
abv
makes
it
tough
to
finish
while
standing
however
this
is
a
great
american
interpretation
of
a
belgian
i
would
purchase
again
d
i
put
down
the
750ml
myself
a
good
beer
but
against
the
true
belgians
this
falls
a
bit
short
d
ok
d
very
well
done
ale
this
is
a
perfect
bottle
to
share
at
10
5
abv
and
coming
in
a
750ml
bottle
get
some
friends
over
to
enjoy
it
with
body
is
creamy
throughout
with
good
carbonation
but
as
stated
the
finish
is
just
a
little
chalky
a
nice
take
on
a
belgian
quad
by
an
american
brewery
enjoyable
d
good
drinkability
probably
a
good
idea
to
split
became
more
complex
as
it
warmed
this
is
a
very
very
tasty
beer
edit
by
midway
through
the
bottle
the
residuals
are
now
lacing
on
my
glass
small
development
but
worth
noting
great
sipper
to
welcome
in
some
fall
temperatures
mouthfeeldrinkability
medium
bodied
with
a
fairly
smooth
mouthfeel
the
alcohol
is
hidden
nicely
by
the
dark
fruity
flavors
overall
not
at
all
what
i
was
expecting
or
hoping
for
what
i
enjoy
about
belgian
styles
is
the
subtle
nuances
and
depth
of
flavors
this
one
just
punches
you
in
the
face
d
fantastically
drinkable
will
definitely
seek
it
out
again
i
can
remember
the
first
time
i
ever
had
the
sixth
glass
beeradvocate
member
turamarth
and
i
were
just
getting
deep
into
craft
beer
this
was
the
first
smokestack
series
beer
we
had
hell
it
was
the
first
quad
wed
ever
had
i
remember
the
amount
of
cinnamon
spice
and
raisin
flavor
being
intriguingly
strong
and
i
especially
remember
thinking
that
this
was
the
booziest
beer
id
ever
had
my
palate
has
grown
an
awful
lot
since
then
i
still
find
it
to
be
too
boozy
tasting
but
this
is
a
fine
fine
beer
one
of
the
best
american
examples
of
the
quadrupel
style
this
beer
has
an
impressive
appearance
there
is
a
lot
of
carbonation
the
head
was
thick
but
disappeared
quickly
the
lace
was
not
thick
as
one
would
imagine
the
aroma
is
complex
there
are
strong
scents
of
wood
and
fruit
the
body
is
dark
reddish
amber
there
are
a
lot
of
wood
flavors
which
were
nice
but
i
felt
it
did
not
counter
the
alcohol
flavor
enough
you
can
definitely
feel
warmth
from
the
10
5
percent
alcohol
typically
big
for
the
style
and
drinks
appropriate
for
style
maybe
on
the
easier
side
of
it
d
very
drinkable
very
delicious
i
will
be
sure
to
pick
this
one
up
again
nicely
balanced
and
a
very
enjoyable
complexity
this
is
a
great
beer
the
aromas
and
tastes
are
very
complex
and
everchanging
as
it
warms
while
the
high
alcohol
obviously
makes
it
a
sipper
the
muted
alcoholic
taste
makes
it
very
inviting
to
take
sip
after
sip
d
while
a
good
example
of
the
style
this
is
not
something
i
consider
to
be
drinkable
to
the
point
that
i
could
have
more
than
one
it
has
a
candylike
element
that
keeps
me
from
enjoying
as
more
than
a
digestif
very
good
seek
this
out
great
for
sharing
thanks
again
karen
d
tastes
like
a
liquid
mincemeat
pie
very
tasty
i
dont
say
it
too
often
but
this
is
a
beautiful
looking
beer
i
really
didnt
find
this
too
complex
but
a
pleasant
beer
overall
it
is
a
fairly
fresh
bottle
as
the
best
before
date
isnt
for
another
3
years
so
at
9
a
bottle
i
may
grab
another
to
age
a
bit
it
was
certainly
a
fine
companion
for
watching
the
end
of
dexter
season
3
overall
a
very
powerful
drink
full
of
sinful
deliciousness
be
careful
or
this
one
could
damn
you
edit
upon
rereview
multiple
times
im
upping
my
rating
on
this
one
to
a
perfect
five
ive
done
enough
reviews
that
i
know
that
this
one
is
as
close
to
perfect
as
its
likely
to
get
and
i
have
never
ever
liked
a
beer
more
than
this
one
if
something
else
winds
up
beating
it
ill
change
my
review
back
to
the
original
4
85
it
was
on
the
first
goround
even
on
my
fifth
or
sixth
revisitation
of
this
brew
i
still
absolutely
love
it
every
time
this
is
my
favorite
smokestack
favorite
quad
and
remains
my
highest
rated
beer
for
good
reason
got
this
as
an
amazing
extra
in
a
trade
with
wnoble
pours
a
murky
bownishreddishorange
with
a
huge
head
which
never
got
below
a
half
finger
of
off
white
lacing
was
lasting
but
thinner
nose
was
dark
fruit
some
alcohol
and
yeast
grapefruit
and
spices
taste
was
complex
and
very
tasty
starting
with
dark
fruit
moving
to
sweet
cinnamon
grapes
and
dates
with
notes
of
chocolate
and
a
wonderful
interplay
with
sweet
and
bitter
and
alcohol
warming
at
the
end
mouthfeel
is
fairly
heavy
almost
chewy
and
well
carbonated
alcohol
is
whew
there
in
feel
and
in
effect
definitely
a
sipper
liked
this
a
lot
and
can
imagine
it
would
be
even
more
wonderful
if
i
had
the
discipline
to
have
cellered
this
longer
try
this
i
knew
absolutely
nothing
about
this
beer
before
trying
it
though
i
had
heard
good
things
about
the
brewery
it
poured
a
pale
amber
with
an
absolutely
massive
and
very
longlasting
head
the
aroma
was
very
unusual
with
some
sour
elements
that
i
did
not
expect
besides
the
usual
malt
and
dark
fruit
notes
common
to
belgian
strong
dark
ales
or
quadruples
on
the
palate
the
beer
was
delicious
with
wonderful
mouthfeel
some
heat
from
the
10
5
alcohol
and
maybe
a
hint
of
sourness
or
perhaps
it
was
wood
from
cask
aging
hard
to
be
absolutely
sure
in
spite
of
working
my
way
through
the
entire
bottle
trying
to
decide
the
beer
that
i
think
it
reminded
me
of
the
most
was
samuel
smiths
yorkshire
stingo
which
is
pretty
high
praise
i
regret
that
this
was
the
only
beer
from
the
smokestack
series
that
ive
been
able
to
try
and
i
wish
i
could
have
brought
a
bottle
or
two
back
to
alaska
to
share
amazing
boulevard
hits
this
one
just
right
packed
with
flavor
and
small
complexities
yet
still
very
drinkable
and
even
approachable
weve
been
to
belgium
a
few
times
and
have
tried
numerous
belgianinspired
beers
around
the
globe
and
this
one
sits
very
close
to
the
top
d
this
one
is
too
strong
and
intricate
to
pound
back
but
its
very
drinkable
id
pound
them
back
until
i
fell
off
my
chair
fortunately
all
it
takes
is
a
single
bottle
m
softly
carbonated
slightly
warming
in
all
it
finishes
clean
this
is
indeed
a
spot
on
quad
sippable
complex
and
pleasant
on
the
palate
one
of
the
best
tasting
quads
ive
had
yet
the
body
was
a
bit
thinner
than
i
like
for
this
style
drinkability
was
good
but
again
this
is
one
of
my
favorite
styles
so
im
predisposed
to
like
it
overall
a
pretyy
good
but
not
great
example
of
the
style
worth
a
shot
if
you
see
it
overall
a
very
heavy
and
tasty
beer
a
good
after
meal
desert
almost
i
would
not
recommend
drinking
this
with
any
food
or
shortly
before
or
after
a
meal
as
it
is
very
rich
definitely
pick
this
up
if
you
have
it
on
hand
at
any
place
around
i
will
definitely
drink
it
regularly
if
i
can
find
it
around
my
hometown
but
i
have
only
seen
it
at
fred
meyers
grocery
picked
up
a
bottle
for
8
99
at
the
qfc
in
bothell
then
enjoyed
at
the
inlaws
place
in
seattle
on
the
4th
of
july
during
fireworks
served
in
stubby
wine
goblets
a
bit
lighter
in
color
than
i
was
expecting
as
it
was
a
lighter
shade
of
chestnut
than
other
quads
i
have
tried
decent
sized
head
forms
with
the
pour
smell
was
very
boozy
and
full
of
ripe
plum
notes
taste
was
very
good
and
true
to
the
quad
style
lots
of
raisin
notes
with
some
black
licorice
and
a
sugary
aftertaste
mouthfeel
was
thick
but
smooth
enough
to
enjoy
drinkability
was
above
average
as
its
a
flavorful
beer
but
its
very
hot
with
alcohol
some
aging
might
mellow
this
beer
down
a
bit
and
do
it
some
good
a
nice
example
of
a
quad
from
a
brewery
that
i
was
curious
to
try
as
you
cant
find
boulevard
in
ma
just
yet
not
a
bad
beer
just
not
one
that
blew
me
away
either
it
is
very
drinkable
for
the
alcohol
level
i
would
just
prefer
a
bit
more
complexity
still
a
nice
beer
and
i
wouldnt
mind
trying
this
one
again
the
taste
was
bold
and
rich
very
strong
malt
and
well
spiced
very
mild
bittering
but
it
wasnt
at
all
cloying
alcohol
was
warming
but
not
at
all
overpowering
very
good
carbonation
and
mouth
feel
poured
a
hazy
reddish
orange
color
with
an
average
frothy
brown
head
that
mostly
diminished
with
fair
lacing
moderate
to
heavy
tart
fruit
and
small
alcohol
aroma
medium
body
with
a
smooth
sticky
texture
and
lively
carbonation
medium
to
heavy
dark
fruit
sweet
flavor
with
a
medium
to
heavy
sweet
finish
of
moderate
to
long
duration
solid
complex
brew
d
delightful
flavorful
complex
but
fairly
balanced
the
abv
will
catch
up
my
fourth
smokestack
series
sample
and
a
pretty
decent
attempt
by
boulevard
not
my
favourite
so
far
but
definitely
recommended
and
definitely
buzz
inducing
at
10
5
abv
d
excellent
i
cant
imagine
someone
not
liking
this
also
i
am
beginning
to
suspect
that
boulevard
all
things
considered
may
be
just
be
one
of
the
best
breweries
on
earth
edit
two
hours
later
as
i
sip
this
i
really
find
this
a
very
enjoyable
beer
i
have
no
qualms
about
pouring
out
a
pricey
beerhello
darkness
and
hunahpu
but
this
was
an
excellent
and
welcome
surprise
im
upping
the
taste
and
drinkability
to
reflect
that
poured
from
a
champagne
style
bottle
into
a
snifter
beer
has
a
huge
fizzy
head
with
a
murky
reddishbrown
body
the
nose
is
sweet
with
sugar
belgian
candy
and
brown
along
with
a
hint
of
molasses
light
to
moderate
phenols
that
just
cover
the
alcohol
the
taste
is
also
rather
sweet
more
so
than
i
would
have
thought
but
it
is
to
style
all
malt
bitterness
only
to
balance
slightly
and
a
definite
alcohol
finish
and
linger
mouthfeel
is
very
full
but
due
to
the
carbonation
it
seems
lighter
and
bubbly
this
could
almost
do
the
job
of
champagne
as
drinkable
as
any
beer
this
big
can
be
one
that
probably
should
be
sipped
and
drinking
6
smaller
glasses
as
opposed
to
chugging
the
bottle
would
probably
be
a
good
idea
there
is
caramel
sweetness
that
will
ooze
out
of
my
pores
there
are
dates
and
cherries
the
oxidation
slight
and
carefree
the
booze
lingers
throughout
the
adventure
never
overpowering
omnipresent
each
small
sip
a
moment
of
divine
pleasure
subdued
hops
round
out
this
beer
beautifully
i
announce
the
winner
of
round
1s
pairings
and
one
of
my
favorite
flavors
of
the
day
this
is
a
great
take
on
a
belgium
quad
the
beer
pours
a
clear
dark
reddish
brown
with
some
purple
highlights
the
nose
is
nice
and
complex
with
notes
of
raisins
brown
sugar
dark
cherries
malts
and
herbs
the
palate
is
full
bodied
and
caramelly
with
soem
fdark
fruity
flavors
and
notes
of
citrus
spice
and
herbs
a
nice
take
on
a
belgian
quad
sweet
fruity
and
caramelish
but
balanced
with
a
dry
touch
in
the
finish
drinks
well
despite
the
boozy
character
md
the
mouthfeel
remains
as
creamysmooth
and
healthilycarbonated
as
any
quality
bottledconditioned
beer
must
dream
to
achieve
the
body
never
goes
too
heavy
in
fact
extremely
balanced
and
approachable
against
its
alc
strength
also
the
hoppiness
balanced
with
the
fruitymaltiness
in
the
aftertaste
prolongs
the
depth
and
complexity
altogether
all
in
all
this
quadruplestyle
ale
is
slightly
too
expensive
but
ive
made
my
efforts
to
fully
enjoy
and
memorise
every
single
drop
from
this
bottle
this
is
perhaps
the
best
bottled
beer
ive
tried
for
many
months
now
even
outperforming
westvleteren
12
as
far
as
my
last
bottle
last
month
is
concerned
d
very
drinkable
especially
with
the
high
abv
d
a
nicely
strong
brew
but
a
good
one
for
the
nicely
strong
you
drink
away
boys
drink
away
drinkability
is
good
for
the
style
and
abv
this
is
a
nicely
crafted
americanstyle
belgianstyle
quad
overall
d
a
good
one
to
split
amongst
a
few
people
maybe
it
is
the
banana
overkill
but
definitely
best
split
this
is
a
strong
beer
the
cherry
bourbon
quad
blows
it
out
of
the
water
but
its
not
bad
just
the
worst
ive
tasted
in
a
stellar
lineup
kinda
like
nick
swisher
on
the
yankees
still
major
league
business
but
not
even
on
the
same
level
as
jeeter
saison
brett
and
arod
bbq
d
lacks
balance
between
the
sweet
fruits
and
the
alcohol
reminds
me
of
watered
down
raisinjack
ill
finish
the
bottle
but
wont
buy
another
drinkability
is
incredible
for
such
a
boozy
beer
i
could
pound
this
back
quite
easily
so
delicious
pours
a
cloudy
medium
brown
with
a
khaki
head
the
aroma
is
dark
fruit
with
some
candi
sugar
yeast
and
brown
sugar
the
aroma
has
something
that
reminds
me
of
red
wine
the
flavor
is
brown
sugar
and
dark
fruits
with
some
alcohol
the
alcohol
is
a
little
boozy
and
also
very
warming
there
is
some
light
spicing
in
the
flavor
and
once
again
something
that
reminds
me
of
a
dark
big
bold
red
wine
low
carbonation
and
medium
body
an
excellent
american
quadrupel
d
high
this
beer
is
delicious
ill
bump
it
down
a
peg
to
fairly
high
due
to
the
strength
of
the
beer
one
bomber
of
this
and
i
would
be
gone
overall
not
my
go
to
style
been
a
while
since
i
had
one
but
this
seems
to
be
a
very
balanced
effort
that
gives
the
trademark
quad
characteristics
without
going
to
any
real
extreme
very
close
to
a
barleywine
in
my
opinion
boulevard
continues
to
impress
with
the
smokestack
series
body
is
full
while
mouthfeel
is
wellspiced
and
contains
a
small
alcohol
wash
which
is
not
at
all
unpleasant
come
to
think
of
it
i
taste
a
little
alcohol
as
well
but
it
too
seems
at
home
sixth
glass
was
drinkable
in
the
sense
that
splitting
the
750
ml
bottle
with
a
friend
i
did
not
become
tired
at
all
of
the
beer
sixth
glass
was
not
drinkable
in
the
sense
that
after
splitting
the
bottle
i
wouldnt
feel
comfortable
driving
for
a
while
all
in
all
very
recommended
d
hmmm
decently
drinkable
the
carbonation
knocks
it
back
eversoslightly
because
the
taste
makes
up
for
it
but
its
also
heavy
enough
and
in
your
face
enough
that
it
is
a
sipper
to
start
with
d
obviously
not
a
lightweight
session
beer
at
10
50
abv
comparing
it
against
other
quads
the
drinkability
is
good
i
wont
have
a
problem
finishing
the
bottle
in
one
sitting
another
great
smokestack
series
offering
drinkability
ok
so
my
two
biggest
complaints
about
are
that
its
a
little
too
hot
and
a
little
too
sweet
that
aside
its
a
solid
brew
at
10
5
im
not
gonna
be
pounding
it
down
anytime
soon
but
it
was
a
good
sipper
on
a
quiet
evening
in
bbq
it
is
not
the
barrel
notes
and
earthiness
of
the
sugar
really
did
work
wonders
with
the
relative
lightness
of
this
one
but
its
a
vast
improvement
over
the
saison
i
had
the
other
evening
recommended
d
excellent
given
its
heft
the
base
beer
of
the
almighty
bbq
is
a
star
in
its
own
right
poured
a
corked
and
caged
750ml
into
my
tripel
karmeliet
tulip
this
beer
pours
an
over
ripe
bruised
orange
with
a
big
off
cream
head
that
leaves
very
very
little
lacing
of
all
the
smokestack
beers
this
one
definitely
has
the
worst
head
retention
the
aroma
is
dark
fruits
muddled
with
dark
malts
fig
date
bruised
apples
and
over
ripe
cherries
all
come
out
in
the
nose
mix
that
with
toast
yeasty
biscuits
and
a
heavy
dose
of
caramel
also
just
a
hint
of
alcohol
comes
through
in
the
nose
the
flavor
is
pretty
typical
quad
big
raisins
dates
figs
bruised
bananas
and
just
a
hint
of
bruised
cherries
also
overly
toasted
bread
mixed
with
overly
caramelized
sugar
the
alcohol
is
there
but
well
hidden
my
biggest
problem
with
this
beer
is
its
mouthfeel
its
just
a
bit
thin
for
how
big
this
beer
is
overall
this
is
my
favorite
standard
smokestack
as
long
as
tank
7
doesnt
go
into
regular
production
thanks
boulevard
d
im
not
going
to
be
slamming
this
but
its
a
very
nice
beer
wish
i
could
get
more
of
it
d
a
great
quad
with
plenty
of
complexity
thanks
zach
d
this
is
a
tasty
and
drinkable
quad
reminds
me
a
lot
of
st
bernardus
abt
12
which
is
a
good
tihng
this
is
a
winner
from
boulevard
overall
thank
you
monsterfat
for
this
beer
it
is
pretty
good
definately
a
slow
drinker
picked
up
a
couple
smokestacks
in
iowa
where
they
are
2
cheaper
than
here
in
minny
6th
glass
was
quite
tasty
i
havent
had
a
quad
in
a
while
so
it
was
a
nice
treat
if
i
was
a
bigger
fan
of
belgians
this
would
definitely
be
a
mainstay
in
my
fridge
d
for
a
quad
this
is
extremely
drinkable
goes
down
smooth
and
the
alcohol
isnt
as
dominating
as
the
inital
aromas
would
indicate
not
bad
but
really
boozy
poured
with
a
nice
sized
foamy
frothy
off
white
head
and
lots
of
lace
color
is
rich
walnut
aroma
is
toffee
malty
and
bananas
flavor
is
malty
sweet
with
a
little
residual
bitterness
body
is
very
good
ditto
carbonation
feel
the
alcohol
at
the
end
this
was
quite
enjoyable
im
loving
the
smokestack
series
not
quite
rochefort
but
a
nice
beer
here
many
thanks
to
wagenvolks
for
the
trade
750ml
corked
and
caged
bottle
into
a
duvel
tulip
pours
a
nice
murky
dark
orange
with
a
very
nice
frothy
khaki
head
that
lasts
and
leaves
beautiful
lacing
on
the
glass
aroma
is
a
nice
blend
of
dried
fruits
and
spices
with
just
a
hint
of
alcohol
the
taste
is
a
very
nice
blend
of
sweet
dried
fruits
figs
and
sweet
burnt
caramel
quite
complex
and
very
tasty
the
beer
is
somewhat
heavy
bodied
but
smooth
carbonation
does
a
good
job
of
masking
the
10
5
alcohol
making
this
one
a
very
nice
sipper
ive
enjoyed
every
beer
ive
had
from
this
series
and
this
one
is
no
exception
overall
i
wish
i
had
bought
two
of
these
so
i
could
leave
one
in
the
cellar
it
could
sure
use
it
one
to
slowly
enjoy
but
certainly
very
nice
the
taste
has
a
strong
malty
sweet
presence
that
encompasses
the
whole
spectrum
of
sugary
flavors
from
light
candy
sweetness
to
caramel
to
toffee
to
heavily
caramelized
brown
sugar
that
being
said
this
beer
is
not
overly
sweet
notes
of
spice
and
dark
fruits
complement
the
malt
and
alcohol
adds
a
pleasant
warming
spiciness
bitterness
and
hop
character
get
out
of
the
way
to
let
the
malt
shine
poured
from
750

it
presented
a
caramel
herbs
aroma
with
presence
of
alcohol
deep
dark
amber
color
frothy
tan
foam
head
medium
sweetness
and
spicy
taste
apple
cider
thin
feel
light
medium
body
i
like
the
entire
series
of
smokestack
brews
from
boulevard
but
this
is
just
average
nice
bottle
presentation
and
cool
labeling
im
a
little
biased
about
this
brewery
because
i
bought
a
sampler
a
couple
weeks
back
that
was
full
of
tasty
beers
the
smell
is
nice
almost
licorice
but
definitely
an
overwhelming
sweetness
as
i
poured
the
beer
i
got
a
great
waft
of
scent
tasty
tasty
tasty
rich
chocolate
caramel
toasted
almond
flavor
does
have
a
fairly
present
alcohol
flavor
but
the
acidity
does
not
overwhelm
the
sweetness
the
aftertaste
does
continue
the
sweetness
but
has
a
bit
of
a
bitter
alcohol
feel
too
no
quadrupel
is
considered
very
drinkable
to
me
i
can
drink
a
bomber
and
thats
about
it
i
could
drink
more
but
i
wouldnt
enjoy
it
as
i
did
the
first
bottle
so
with
that
said
this
was
fairly
drinkable
for
a
quad
it
didnt
leave
an
overwhelming
aftertaste
d
really
nice
brew
that
had
a
definitely
felt
like
an
american
quad
if
there
is
such
a
thing
complex
and
flavorful
definitely
worth
picking
up
taste
is
sharp
and
sweet
a
little
funky
but
still
rich
and
strong
very
sharp
but
not
too
carbonated
overall
a
really
good
but
id
say
go
for
the
bbq
if
you
can
it
really
kicks
this
up
a
notch
md
super
velvety
smooth
what
a
quality
brew
rich
and
complex
in
flavor
full
bodied
many
different
flavors
create
such
a
layered
taste
one
of
the
best
if
not
the
best
american
quads
i
have
ever
had
nearly
rochefort
levels
reddish
brown
and
impossible
to
see
through
with
a
fizzy
tan
head
that
slowly
settles
into
a
skim
in
the
middle
of
my
chimay
glass
the
nose
is
belgian
spice
and
dark
fruit
with
fresh
pumpernickel
breadiness
the
flavor
is
rich
and
spicy
with
flavors
of
gingersnap
and
hot
buttered
rum
full
bodied
and
highly
carbonated
with
a
warmingly
alcoholic
finish
a
nice
sipper
for
the
money
and
a
decent
stab
at
the
style
not
on
par
with
the
best
belgian
made
examples
but
a
fine
brew
worth
checking
out
a
barley
wine
colored
beer
with
a
nice
amount
of
head
prominent
apple
bread
clove
and
a
mild
acidic
quality
sweet
burnt
brown
sugar
caramel
a
bit
of
alcohol
on
the
nose
but
for
a
us
quad
not
bad
sugar
qualities
similar
to
their
triple
not
a
must
but
sufficient
an
excellent
example
of
the
style
now
if
i
can
get
my
hands
on
the
bourbon
barrel
version
well
be
in
business
flavor
is
warm
obviously
a
lot
of
alcohol
some
bitterness
on
the
backend
due
to
roasting
lots
of
sweetness
up
front
there
is
some
sour
character
in
the
beer
as
well
beer
is
relatively
thick
in
the
mouth
which
is
good
drinkability
suffers
slightly
due
to
high
alcohol
flavor
overall
a
great
quad
pours
an
initially
hazy
amber
color
not
quite
brown
a
giant
head
forms
on
top
falls
back
and
leaves
very
sticky
lacing
it
then
clears
up
pretty
well
staying
a
nice
clear
amber
color
throughout
a
nice
looking
beer
a
little
lighter
in
color
than
i
would
expect
but
nice
looking
the
smell
is
incredibly
nutty
and
raisiny
sticky
like
syrup
and
a
tiny
bit
toasty
it
almost
gets
rich
and
buttery
in
the
smell
a
bit
theres
even
hints
of
some
different
grains
maybe
some
regular
sugars
unstarch
converted
kind
the
taste
kind
of
sticks
out
as
a
spicy
caramel
syrup
flavor
i
notice
some
cinnamon
clove
nutmeg
maybe
some
other
floral
aspects
theres
also
a
slightly
bready
toasty
aspect
to
the
flavor
with
a
bit
of
earthy
nuts
pretty
good
i
like
the
somewhat
clean
profile
in
some
respects
its
pretty
full
a
bit
medium
but
not
quite
syrupy
and
sweet
the
carbonation
just
sort
of
rushes
in
pleasantly
without
a
bite
the
alcohol
is
a
bit
powerful
though
quite
normal
for
the
style
enjoyable
fits
within
the
style
nothing
wrong
with
it
but
nothing
outstanding
recommended
for
those
seeking
out
new
examples
of
the
style
i
love
the
story
on
the
back
label
regarding
the
name
and
i
made
sure
to
heed
its
lesson
this
is
a
strong
beer
and
it
tastes
strong
so
its
one
to
sit
with
for
a
couple
hours
if
drinking
it
alone
and
this
long
lazy
sunday
afternoon
seems
just
right
for
such
a
thing
this
is
a
very
well
crafted
brew
from
boulevard
im
dang
impressed
with
this
its
terrific
if
i
could
afford
it
id
put
away
about
four
fifths
of
this
magic
elixer
in
a
in
a
row
d
very
nice
and
a
good
deal
for
what
i
got
it
for
give
it
a
show
for
sure
d
this
is
a
nice
complex
beer
to
sip
slowly
and
i
would
like
to
try
this
one
latter
sometime
d
that
heavy
is
almost
too
much
what
i
do
really
like
is
the
way
that
there
isnt
an
alcohol
burn
but
when
it
gets
to
your
chest
it
is
very
warming
and
then
you
really
feel
the
alcohol
like
a
good
stiff
drink
mouthfeel
is
wonderful
because
it
dances
on
the
line
between
extremely
attenuated
and
full
bodied
another
highly
drinkable
beer
out
of
the
smokestack
series
i
wish
i
could
get
these
beers
here
in
central
pa
highly
recommended
tastes
all
of
that
a
bit
of
bitter
astringency
which
is
normal
enough
for
the
style
but
still
a
fault
if
you
asked
me
bitter
orange
peel
notquiteripe
blood
orange
juice
some
spiciness
hints
of
anise
a
tasty
quad
next
experiment
see
how
aging
a
bottle
will
change
the
alcohol
character
poured
into
tulip
glass
pours
a
nice
dark
amber
color
with
a
good
amount
of
head
that
sticks
around
for
a
couple
minutes
but
finally
calms
down
has
a
decent
lacing
has
an
earthy
smell
with
hints
of
caramel
and
malt
the
taste
is
somewhat
sweet
with
hints
of
caramel
and
fruit
the
mouth
feel
is
good
with
just
the
right
amount
of
carbination
drinkability
is
pretty
good
but
ironically
i
feel
like
the
balancing
earthy
bitterness
in
this
one
actually
holds
it
back
tone
it
down
pull
back
the
alcohol
this
one
soars
mouthfeel
is
gritty
and
fizzy
noticeably
strong
overall
impression
mediocre
quad
nice
color
okay
aroma
very
drinkable
but
with
other
beers
available
i
probably
wont
buy
again
all
and
all
another
authentic
belgian
beer
it
doesnt
quite
live
up
to
the
belgian
greats
nonetheless
sixth
glass
is
a
tasty
brew
its
a
worthy
addition
to
the
belgian
beer
landscape
many
thanks
to
all
who
have
assisted
me
with
obtaining
this
beer
over
time
pours
a
slightly
hazy
light
mahogany
color
with
full
fingered
auburn
head
that
resists
fading
and
a
nice
amount
of
belgian
lacing
left
behind
the
smell
is
sweet
malty
belgian
yeast
and
doughy
caramel
adequately
carbonated
and
full
bodied
there
is
an
initial
sharpness
and
spicy
character
to
the
mouth
feel
the
flavors
are
a
mirror
of
the
nose
the
10
5
abv
is
well
integrated
a
very
nice
drinker
received
in
trade
approximately
a
year
ago
probably
from
dirtylou
or
perhaps
from
a
kinder
fellow
d
fairly
easy
drinking
but
it
doesnt
really
all
fit
together
something
tells
me
this
beer
may
need
to
be
beefed
up
one
way
or
another
in
the
brewhouse
needs
something
and
i
cant
quite
put
my
finger
on
it
maybe
a
little
bit
more
of
a
strong
beer
presence
which
this
lacks
seems
a
little
separated
is
the
best
way
for
me
to
describe
it
okay
beer
but
wont
seek
out
again
overall
i
really
liked
this
beer
a
ton
of
of
flavor
a
tad
boozy
but
that
was
expected
splitting
the
750
is
a
great
idea
good
beer
from
blvd
but
make
sure
you
arent
drinking
it
alone
drinkability
pretty
satisfying
beer
but
the
alcohol
really
sneaks
up
on
you
fast
it
seems
to
be
more
highly
drinkable
than
it
should
be
drinkability
im
going
a
little
higher
on
this
than
i
should
because
of
that
10
abv
but
it
is
pretty
damn
tasty
and
i
really
like
the
mouthfeel
that
allows
me
to
continue
tasting
those
malts
d
pretty
drinkable
it
has
a
ton
of
alcohol
and
a
ton
of
flavor
which
is
why
they
call
it
a
quad
i
suppose
good
beer
for
sure
but
i
had
to
split
the
bomber
with
a
buddy
are
there
people
that
really
just
enjoy
phenols
i
wonder
i
love
quads
this
is
a
very
good
quad
more
in
the
belgian
style
than
some
of
the
other
lighter
americanstyled
quads
i
really
like
this
beer
overall
a
little
too
onedimensional
with
its
sweetness
i
unfortunately
have
to
compare
it
with
some
pretty
great
examples
of
the
style
and
it
just
doesnt
stack
up
to
its
true
belgian
counterparts
a
decent
value
its
not
as
drinkable
as
some
beers
but
i
only
need
a
pint
or
two
of
this
and
im
ready
to
pass
out
it
could
easily
by
my
favorite
beer
but
i
have
so
many
i
havnt
tried
yet
i
havent
tried
much
from
this
brewer
as
we
dont
get
their
products
in
my
state
but
luckily
their
products
are
showing
up
in
a
neighboring
state
about
six
miles
away
the
color
of
this
was
a
dense
dark
amber
with
tinge
of
garnet
when
held
against
the
light
the
nose
was
redolent
of
sweet
spicy
malt
on
the
palate
a
quick
burst
of
tiny
bubbles
followed
by
brown
sugar
caramel
and
turbinado
then
a
slight
bitterness
on
the
palate
and
a
long
finish
drinkability
is
pretty
good
a
decent
quad
but
lacking
the
depth
you
find
in
the
best
examples
of
the
style
still
i
appreciate
the
strong
flavor
a
fine
second
choice
it
certainly
held
up
to
the
cigar
quite
well
also
not
a
bad
price
for
the
packaging
another
hallmark
of
the
smokestack
line
i
was
extremely
surprised
by
how
good
this
beer
was
it
was
totally
unexpected
so
many
flavors
hitting
me
at
once
all
of
them
vying
for
my
love
so
damn
good
it
seemed
like
the
perfect
marriage
of
candied
malts
and
dark
fruit
a
great
all
around
quad
id
like
to
know
if
this
ages
well
a
part
of
me
says
no
but
that
may
be
because
i
have
another
bottle
sitting
down
in
the
cellar
bring
on
a
westy
12
somebody
cork
shot
out
of
bottle
but
luckily
no
foaming
issues
out
of
the
bottle
beer
heavily
carbonated
but
quickly
dampens
down
to
some
clinging
on
side
of
glass
and
on
top
of
beer
beer
is
muddy
brown
and
very
dark
smell
is
quite
appealing
with
notes
of
dark
fruit
especially
cherry
and
plum
maltiness
is
there
too
taste
follows
smell
with
hints
of
cherry
and
fig
beer
is
syrupy
and
nicely
carbonated
some
bitterness
in
the
finish
but
minimal
beer
is
tasty
as
hell
and
highly
recommended
i
havent
had
a
whole
lot
of
quads
from
us
brewers
but
this
one
was
one
of
the
better
ones
i
remember
definitely
worth
a
shot
boulevard
the
sixth
glass
quadrupel
ale
isnt
as
good
as
long
strange
tripel
but
im
glad
that
its
readily
available
in
my
local
grocery
and
im
thrilled
that
its
only
7
99
per
bottle
even
though
i
wouldnt
sell
my
soul
to
beelzebub
for
a
bottle
this
is
a
more
than
decent
effort
that
deserves
a
look
for
anyone
even
remotely
interested
in
the
style
thick
and
creamy
this
is
a
beer
that
stands
up
and
say
hey
drink

easy

not
as

little
closer
to
a

in
my
opinion
i
have
more
of
these
and
it
will
be
interesting
to
see
how
this
matures
with
cellaring
drinkability
is
within
the
style

thats
challenging
its
a
big
beer
that
wears
its

obvious
ways

should
make

like
this

their
doublewide
i
do
like
their
pale
ale
a
lot
too
cheers
boulevard
well
done
d
less
complexity
than
other
quads
overall
a
pretty
good
beer
in
my
location
this
an
a
easily
accessible
beer
and
one
i
grab
often
d
this
bottle
is
not
going
to
be
an
issue
at
all
thanks
to
that
feel
this
sob
is
going
down
nice
and
easy
not
sitting
heavily
at
all
abv
doesnt
appear
to
be
an
issue
in
feel
or
taste
but
i
could
see
it
catching
up
with
you
i
see
this
an
easy
kill
on
the
750
but
not
need
to
push
it
beyond
there
absolutely
easy
to
kill
2
or
3
glasses
though
a
solid
brew
all
around
and
really
was
a
treat
as
my
first
boulevard
brew
drinkability
reminds
me
a
bit
of
the
westvleteren
12
and
that
is
high
praise
although
that
beer
and
this
are
a
bit
too
sweet
and
alcoholic
to
be
particularly
drinkable
perhaps
i
didnt
enjoy
it
as
much
as
i
would
have
in
the
middle
of
the
winter
or
in
front
of
a
fire
i
will
try
it
again
next
december
and
let
you
all
know
d
pretty
decent
but
this
one
fails
to
impress
me
worth
a
try
poured
a
dark
brown
with
a
beige
colored
head
i
liked
the
aromas
in
this
beer
there
was
a
caramel
sweet
raisin
and
fruity
aroma
this
has
a
very
strong
flavor
that
to
me
was
dominated
at
first
by
a
sweet
alcohol
flavor
the
caramel
brown
sugar
and
raisin
flavors
show
up
in
the
middle
and
then
there
is
a
nice
warm
alcohol
finish
i
was
surprised
at
how
much
brown
sugar
there
was
in
the
taste
it
really
went
well
with
the
raisin
flavors
i
had
this
with
some
apple
cobbler
so
that
might
have
really
brought
out
some
of
those
flavors
as
well
really
enjoyed
this
one
abv
is
hidden
well
for
as
high
as
it
is
lets
be
honest
you
cant
hide
10
12
easily
and
this
beer
does
it
very
well
attenuated
the
only
thing
that
would
make
this
beer
better
is
a
bittering
presence
maybe
some
dry
hopping
but
the
style
doesnt
call
for
it
d
i
really
liked
this
beer
a
very
well
done
quad
that
im
glad
i
picked
up
a
perfect
accompaniment
to
the
snowy
evening
i
drank
it
on
as
a
side
note
what
is
up
with
the
batch
numbers
i
have
no
clue
i
see
most
saying
it
starts
off
with
a

my

looks
more
like

you
have
any
insight

that
characterize

good

good

smells
of
sweet
malt
some
subdued
tart
malt
slight
alcohol
and
some
fruity
aromas
fits
the
style
of
a
quadrupel
mouth
feel
is
very
smooth
and
slightly
chewy
there
is
an
average
carbonation
level
tastes
of
tart
malt
fruit
then
sweet
malt
there
is
noticeable
alcohol
throughout
but
not
too
overpowering
and
finishes
with
some
tartness
there
isnt
any
dryness
which
i
really
enjoyed
and
the
higher
abv
is
deceptively
hidden
by
the
overall
smoothness
pretty
good
beer
but
of
the
smokestack
i
still
pick
the
double
wide
ipa
as
the
best
the
alcohol
is
overwhelming
while
cool
but
even
when
it
warms
i
wish
the
alcohol
was
a
bit
less
forward
more
retention
on
the
head
would
help
but
overall
nicely
complex
and
enjoyable
a
very
nice
sipping
beer
overall
it
is
a
pretty
good
beer
it
will
take
me
awhile
to
finish
it
as
it
is
drinking
very
thick
not
so
sure
i
would
buy
it
again
it
is
a
little
too
bitter
for
my
taste
would
probably
improve
with
some
age
would
have
probably
had
a
higher
score
if
had
not
been
preceded
by
the

nice
redbrown
not
quite
transparent
or
opaque
the
head
died
a
swift
death
so
there
is
not
much
to
comment
on
there
the
aroma
was
like
a
fresh
cut
apple
cinnamon
and
pepper
nice
the
flavor
was
a
little
hot
with
more
cinnamon
alcohol
and
fruity
flavors
this
was
incredibly
easy
to
drink
despite
the
high
abv
and
it
was
quite
an
enjoyable
beer
mouthfeel
is
medium
bodied
with
very
lively
carbonation
dhighly
drinkably
perhaps
a
little
bit
too
drinkable
considering
the
abv
extremely
enjoyable
smooth
and
complex
different
and
left
me
wanting
more
i
will
buy
this
beer
again
for
sure
great
taste
but
watch
out
that
abv
will
sneak
up
on
you
wow
this
is
an
impressive
quad
complex
inviting
caramel
and
belgian
malt
layers
balance
perfectly
with
floral
semibitter
hops
and
subtle
fruity
yeast
notes
im
immediately
taken
aback
by
how
wellhidden
the
10
2
abv
seems
to
be
the
only
hint
of
booze
is
a
warming
finish
mouthfeel
is
creamy
softly
carbonated
mediumthick
and
finishes
beautifully
all
in
all
this
is
an
excellent
quadrupel
that
lives
up
to
the
smokestack
name
not
only
that
but
id
guarantee
that
this
beer
ages
well
ill
be
picking
up
some
more
for
just
that
purpose
soon
now
for
a
taste
this
tastes
similar
to
what
ommegang
three
philosophers
would
taste
like
if
there
was
no
lambic
added
and
it
had
a
bit
more
body
thick
and
creamy
on
the
tongue
and
the
alcohol
heat
comes
out
a
bit
to
thin
and
dry
it
out
caramelized
apples
burnt
walnuts
raisins
and
sherry
spice
in
the
alcohol
but
not
too
much
heat
looks
like
the
fermentation
temperature
was
kept
well
under
control
with
this
one
which
is
vital
for
a
smooth
belgian
that
you
dont
want
to
have
to
soak
in
a
sugary
coverup
flavor
id
say
that
the
hops
alcohol
and
malt
is
very
well
balanced
to
make
this
a
big
complex
interesting
quad
this
would
be
great
for
after
a
big
dinner
in
the
winter
i
would
even
pair
it
with
apple
or
pumpkin
pie
the
residual
sweetness
lingers
as
it
warms
up
keeping
it
very
drinkable
taste
is
alcohol
chocolate
and
crystal
maltiness
and
white
bread
toast
i
knew
the
moment
i
tasted
it
that
further
aging
would
be
benificial
not
as
much
residual
sugar
sweetness
as
some
other
american
quads
i
have
had
recently
some
raisinlike
fruitiness
but
not
as
much
as
i
expected
it
does
have
an
actual
hop
presence
not
found
in
many
examples
of
the
style
pretty
good
but
quads
are
far
from
my
favorite
style
nutty
aroma
of
almond
maybe
dates
also
subdued
and
not
overly
sweet
like
some
belgian
quads
malty
flavors
with
strong
estery
notes
from
the
yeast
more
dried
fruits
and
nuts
with
a
slowly
dissipating
warmth
following
the
finish
it
was
sturdy
but
not
heavy
or
syrupy
light
enough
to
want
to
finish
the
whole
bottle
easily
great
choice
for
a
winter
night
with
good
cellar
potential
pours
a
huge
creamy
tan
colored
head
diminishing
and

which
really
overshadow
the

way
to

im
serious
my

lit
on
fire
each
sips
tastes
like
a
st

with
a
shot
and
a
half
of
cheap
vodka
maybe
try
and
grab
another
and
let
it
sit
for
at
least
three
years
out
of
fear
the
quadrupel
ale
presented
a
dark
and
slightly
cloudy
appearance
almost
chocolatey
looking
surprisingly
there
was
not
much
aroma
with
this
ale
the
taste
was
chocolatey
with
hints
of
a
caramel
finish
the
sixth
glass
seemed
very
carbonated
but
kind
of
heavy
with
a
smooth
finish
this
is
a
pretty
decent
ale
i
would
definitely
drink
this
again
d
i
didnt
make
it
past
the
first
glass
so
that
probably
speaks
for
itself

head

the

is
excellent
it
smells
like
brown
sugar
raisins
figs
cherries
belgian
yeast
rum
ginger
and
some
pepper
the
taste
is
slightly
different
than
the
aroma
it
tastes
like
dark
fruit
pepper
ginger
yeast
booze
cloves
and
a
slight
tart
taste
i
cant
identify
theres
also
a
bit
of
a
bitter
finish
which
i
didnt
expect
since
the
aroma
was
so
sweet
and
malty
mouthfeelbody
is
medium
its
coating
and
slick
but
seems
a
bit
thin
but
not
watery
for
the
style
carbonation
is
high
drinkability
is
good
even
with
the
high
carbonation
its
still
easy
and
enjoyable
to
drink
i
think
this
is
a
good
quad
id
pick
this
up
again
in
the
future
many
of
my
friends
cant
stomach
most
of
the
beer
i
like
and
they
all
enjoyed
this
that
should
tell
you
something
picked
up
a
bottle
at
princeton
liquors
in
maple
grove
man
this
is
my
favorite
quad
that
ive
had
in
a
while
and
i
had
a
pannepot
the
same
day
at
first
it
smelled
of
spiced
rum
but
as
it
warmed
sweet
dates
and
black
cherries
came
out
with
a
tinge
of
cinnamon
and
ginger
clove
phenols
grow
but
never
overpower
as
the
beer
approaches
room
temperature
very
drinkable
and
rich
in
flavor
something
a
bit
different
from
your
normal
caramelmalt
driven
quad
id
call
this
musttry
for
quadlovers
d
a
nice
sipper
especially
as
a
weekend
nightcap
d
this
aspect
of
the
ratings
always
puzzles
me
of
course
you
dont
want
to
guzzle
something
like
this
for
a
session
but
on
the
balance
its
a
very
easy
drink
given
its
abv
this
is
a
less
heavy
version
of
a
quad
but
that
lends
to
very
high
drinkability
for
the
style
and
i
made
it
through
the
bottle
much
easier
than
i
should
for
a
beer
this
big
be
very
careful
because
i
wasnt
nice
deep
orange
color
with
a
huge
fluffy
white
head
that
goes
on
and
on
moderate
spicysulfury
aroma
very
earthy
great
big
boozy
belgian
taste
to
it
traces
of
caramel
and
spices
really
has
a
nice
sweet
sugary
taste
yeasty
flavors
with
a
minimum
of
spice
dried
fruit
lingering
bite
good
mouthfeel
a
very
drinkable
beer
for
sure
only
my
2nd
try
at
boulevard
brewing
but
a
very
solid
effort
d
sits
heavy
on
the
palette
the
carbonation
is
making
this
beer
very
filling
the
alcohol
is
probably
the
factor
that
reduces
the
drinkability
of
this
beer
the
most
you
have
to
be
very
careful
with
it
despite
its
10
5
abv
this
is
pretty
darn
drinkable
just
dont
drink
too
many
too
quick
as
they
will
hammer
you
if
youre
in
the
midwest
and
see
a
750
style
bottle
of
this
for
reasonable
prices
79
dollars
dont
hesitate
for
a
second
if
youre
in
the
mood
for
a
dark
belgian
style
ale
very
well
done
impressive
take
on
the
style
from
n
american
brewery
goes
down
easily
as
good
quads
do
when
i
drink
them
size
of
this
beast
is
cause
for
restraint
still
this
is
one
to
sip
savor
and
share
notes
from
121707
keep
up
the
great
work
with
the
smokestack
beers
i
love
them
pretty
good
stuff
looking
forward
to
trying
the
other
smokestack
beers
from
boulevard
d
quite
delicious
turned
a
friend
of
mine
into
a
belgian
lover
he
originally
would
only
drink
ipas
though
this
beer
is
quite
high
on
alcohol
so
its
not
a
force
to
be
reckoned
with
d
this
one
caught
me
off
guard
thanks
to
mhewes
for
one
of
the
best
american
quads
ive
tried
boulevard
absolutely
nailed
this
one
these
are
for
real
body
is
heavy
and
sticky
very
enjoyable
but
in
moderation
it
takes
its
toll
quickly
from
what
i
have
had
this
follows
the
style
closely
i
just
dont
think
i
am
a
big
fan
of
the
style
interesting
and
i
am
not
having
any
problems
finishing
the
bottle
for
those
that
like
quads
this
is
one
of
the
best
american
versions
i
have
had
drinkability
good
pours
dark
copper
with
a
thick
tan
head
brown
sugar
yeast
dark
candied
fruits
and
malt
in
the
nose
boozy
glaze
over
all
the
flavors
raisins
dates
molasses
vanilla
and
caramel
blend
with
the
spice
to
form
a
heavy
belgian
ale
this
would
do
well
as
a
winter
brew
nice
but
a
bit
too
sweet
to
go
the
whole
bottle
you
need
help
d
wish
it
was
less
boozy
but
enjoyable
otherwise
but
rather
grab
other
quads
in
the
end
pours
brown
with
red
tones
tan
head
nose
is
perfume
and
dough
flavor
profile
brings
lots
of
caramel
a
full
plate
of
spices
a
good
amount
of
dough
just
a
slight
touch
of
alcohol
there
but
its
really
balanced
feel
is
smooth
on
all
aspects
this
is
really
nice
to
drink
good
complexities
and
a
good
american
interpretation
this
is
my
first
experience
with
boulevard
and
its
been
very
impressive
the
sixth
glass
can
easily
compete
with
some
of
the
top
quads
out
there
given
that
its
brewed
here
in
america
only
makes
it
that
much
more
impressive
i
cant
really
identify
any
material
flaws
here
this
is
a
very
good
beer
thats
worth
seeking
out
d
drinkability
is
good
approaching
very
good
the
10
5
is
pretty
easy
to
get
through
still
one
bottle
is
enough
starts
to
get
boozy
about
half
way
through
but
not
completely
in
a
bad
way
nice
complexity
and
very
smooth
this
is
my
first
experience
with
the
smokestack
series
and
it
is
a
good
one
easily
recommended
as
this
is
a
nice
example
of
the
quadrupel
style
overall
easily
my
favorite
offering
from
boulevard
a
great
take
on
the
belgian
style
and
in
my
opinion
on
par
with
the
chimay
though
not
quite
on
the
sublime
level
of
goodness
that
westvleteren
and
rochefort
have
achieved
looking
forward
to
the
bourbonbarrel
edition
a
quality
brew
would
work
well
with
a
thick
sauced
meat
dish
a
great
brew
in
style
from
the
states
makes
me
look
forward
to
finding
others
from
the
brewer
overall
a
wonderful
quad
not
only
did
i
get
to
try
a
local
beer
from
missouri
but
i
got
to
try
my
first
quad
made
in
the
u
s
this
is
not
only
worthy
of
a
try
but
it
should
be
compared
with
rochefort
pannetpot
etc
the
only
negative
is
that
it
just
seems
to
be
missing
that
it
factor
that
the
other
european
quads
have
i
cant
explain
it
but
still
an
awesome
beer
d
a
very
good
quad
i
can
not
find
any
faults
really
one
i
will
be
going
back
to
many
times
i
am
sure
taste
is
very
mellow
and
sweet
malts
with
a
slight
bitterness
then
the
alcohol
warms
the
throat
and
bam
you
have
a
very
drinkable
beer
from
boulevard
brewing
i
think
the
tripel
and
this
quad
are
the
best
of
the
series
really
a
great
tasting
drink
that
goes
down
suprisingly
goes
down
easy
even
with
the
high
abv
massively
carbonated
as
four
fingers
of
honey
comb
tan
head
reaches
the
top
of
the
glass
and
fades
crackling
to
a
half
an
inch
in
minutes
body
is
a
deep
burgundy
brownish
amber
very
beautiful
nose
is
zesty
and
spice
filled
with
tones
of
fresh
cut
wood
vanilla
pepper
soap
and
carmel
enters
the
mouth
with
a
pillow
like
soft
creamy
feel
that
rides
a
zesty
carpet
of
even
spicyness
vanilla
is
big
and
sweet
up
front
on
the
palate
spice
feel
is
a
bit
peppery
but
really
very
smooth
toasty
phelonic
feel
is
so
soft
and
consistant
mouthfeel
thickens
on
the
back
of
the
tongue
as
you
continue
to
drink
this
is
a
hugely
drinkable
beer
at
10
5
alchol
which
is
superbly
well
hidden
this
is
a
sleeper
of
a
brew
the
quaff
is
not
that
impressive
a
semiboozy
blast
of
a
cloying
cherry
syrup
no
belgian
yeast
just
an
over
carbonated
brew
that
doesnt
drink
that
well
a
mediocre
stab
at
the
belgian
dark
ale
i
wont
be
after
any
more
of
this
one
d
would
tire
easily
but
a
nice
one
to
try
did
i
mention
the
sweetness
i
could
sip
this
all
night
first
class
brew
now
im
eager
to
try
the
other
three
from
the
smokestack
series
excellent
a
good
beer
reminds
me
of
the
long
strange
but
a
spicer
and
not
as
sweet
a
little
goes
a
long
way
this
beer
pours
a
cloudy
amber
color
the
head
is
a
massive
billowy
three
inches
and
recedes
very
slowly
into
a
thick
cap
that
lasts
until
the
beer
is
gone
the
aroma
is
of
anise
dates
prunes
and
figs
the
taste
leans
more
towards
the
dates
figs
and
prunes
than
it
does
toward
the
anise
the
is
also
a
sharp
alcohol
burn
in
the
aftertaste
the
mouthfeel
is
full
bodied
with
a
velvety
texture
and
lively
carbonation
overall
this
is
a
very
good
quadrupel
in
fact
i
cant
think
of
a
better
american
made
example
this
is
a
good
attempt
by
a
midwestern
brewer
at
the
quad
style
i
think
this
beer
would
be
even
better
if
it
were
shelved
properly
probably
the
best
nonbelgian
quad
i
have
had
i
thik
they
nailed
the
style
here
i
am
quite
impressed
and
hoping
to
try
more
from
this
kc
brewery
750ml
corked
caged
out
of
the
fridge
long
enough
to
sweat
a
bit
my
mouth
is
watering
its
cloudy
copper
brown
with
an
active
light
tan
head
that
starts
very
frothy
then
settles
into
a
thin
creamy
layer
the
smell
is
cinnamon
raisins
sugar
with
an
appealing
peachy
flowery
smell
it
has
a
nice
underlying
chalky
note
taste
is
wonderful
it
is
peppery
at
first
with
a
nice
biscuity
malt
and
then
melts
to
a
rich
caramel
maybe
a
touch
onedimensional
on
the
finish
but
that
one
dimension
is
delicious
maybe
a
bit
too
sweet
in
the
aftertaste
but
thats
a
nit
to
pick
another
day
the
mouthfeel
is
chewy
a
touch
sticky
with
nice
carbonation
throughout
drinkability
is
good
with
the
alcohol
just
a
pleasant
warmth
down
the
gullet
id
definitely
buy
it
again
its
a
welcome
good
example
of
the
style
from
a
us
brewer
evidence
that
not
every
beer
brewed
in
the
us
is
brewed
for
hopheads
not
that
theres
anything
wrong
with
that
poured
into
a
westmalle
chalice
a
hazy
brunt
orangelight
brown
color
with
two
fingers
worth
of
foam
that
recedes
semislowly
leaving
behind
some
decent
lacing
candi
sugar
yeast
candied
fruit
and
hints
of
caramel
in
the
nose
taste
is
fairly
sweet
in
the
front
flavor
of
cherry
cordials
burnt
sugar
some
fruitiness
maybe
some
orange
flavors
that
creep
up
and
then
disappear
some
caramel
slightest
hints
of
chocolate
some
green
hop
character
in
the
background
slightly
spicy
and
peppery
very
complex
and
thats
definitely
a
good
thing
nice
creamy
mouthfeel
but
enough
carbonation
zip
on
the
tongue
that
makes
this
one
bright
and
extremely
drinkable
for
the
high
abv
alcohol
warming
can
be
felt
but
its
fairly
well
hidden
for
the
amount
a
fantastic
belgian
style
quad
ive
been
impressed
with
the
smokestack
series
so
far
and
out
of
the
three
ive
tried
this
one
has
to
be
my
favorite
looking
forward
to
the
bourbon
barrel
quad
w
cherries
to
come
out
kudos
to
boulevard
this
is
the
2nd
out
of
this
smokestack
series
from
boulevard
and
holy
tapdancing
christ
they
must
of
kidnapped
half
of
the
brewers
in
belgium
and
forced
them
to
make
beer
in
kc
out
of
the
bomber
pours
a
very
dark
red
amber
colored
brew
with
a
nice
ivory
color
smell
is
fantastic
a
very
spicy
aroma
hits
you
firstthe
alcohol
is
noticeable
in
the
nose
but
overall
its
a
yeasty
spicy
aroma
taste
is
awesome
a
full
spicy
flavorful
journey
of
a
beer
well
worth
the
8
bucks
for
the
bottle
it
is
comparable
to
alot
of
your
true
belgians
which
cost
far
more
for
far
less
beer
so
its
a
good
value
just
an
awesome
beer
one
of
the
best
belgians
ive
had
as
well
as
one
of
the
best
domestic
beers
i
would
love
to
get
my
hands
on
a
few
of
these
to
cellar
this
seems
like
one
that
will
be
absolutly
great
with
a
bit
of
age
on
it
big
body
big
abv
tastes
like
a
fine
belgian
quad
great
quality
brew
d
bad
ass
beer
but
it
is
very
strong
tasting
and
with
its
high
abv
it
isnt
too
suitable
for
a
high
volume
in
one
sitting
d
somewhat
drinkability
was
pretty
high
for
this
one
would
have
it
again
a
very
nice
job

i
was
really
hoping
for
something
great

im

disappointed
perhaps
the

brew

nothing
a

the
best
that

has
to

and
thats
no

claim
thank
you

for

me
proud

inviting

i
would
have
guessed
to
be
even
higher
than
10
5
this
one
is
an
stunner
from
start
to
finishpure
darkness
at
its
best
d
this
is
an
outstanding
beer
from
a
brewer
that
ive
grown
to
love
boulevard
is
making
some
good
stuff
these
days
and
this
is
just
about
the
cream
of
the
crop
d
i
love
quads
and
this
is
a
quad
to
love
it
fits
well
in
the
belgium
tradition
it
is
a
bit
much
for
a
session
beer
but
a
wonderful
sipper
and
great
night
cap
drinkability
fantastic
i
wish
i
had
brought
three
or
four
bottles
of
this
back
instead
of
one
damn
you
tsa
and
your
liquid
restrictions
damn
you
us
air
and
your
15
per
checked
bag
damn
you
liquid
and
glass
for
weighing
so
much
d
pretty
damn
good
and
easy
drinking
great
flavor
great
aftertaste
and
even
though
the
abv
is
on
the
higher
end
its
almost
barely
noticeable
but
will
limit
how
much
you
can
drink
by
sixth
glass
ive
had
my
fill
and
the
alcohol
is
getting
the
better
of
me
granted
the
sixth
glass
is
a
small
one
still
ill
make
sure
not
to
follow
any
welldressed
men
home
drinkability
is
good
this
is
a
nice
lighter
tasting
quad
doesnt
have
that
thick
feel
and
strong
flavors
that
i
usually
taste
in
the
style
but
this
is
a
nice
beer
that
is
surprisingly
easy
to
sip
definitely
a
sipper
but
i
could
enjoy
this
all
night
long
score
one
for
boulevard
brewing
co
ive
always
been
a
fan
but
theyve
outdone
themselves
this
time
now
its
time
to
head
back
to
the
store
and
buy
the
ipa
although
this
seemed
at
times
a
strong
dubbel
im
again
impressed
that
boulevard
has
so
successfully
understood
and
conceived
their
belgian
ales
true
to
style
this
came
on
a
little
spicy
and
a
little
strong
making
it
a
good
candidate
for
aging
and
definitely
a
beer
that
would
pair
wonderfully
with
a
number
of
traditional
belgian
dishes
flemish
stew
perhaps
drinkability
is
good
the
carbonation
helps
lighten
things
up
a
little
but
also
carries
just
a
touch
of
sting
not
quite
balanced
but
i
still
like
it
pours
a
cloudy
amber
orange
pretty
vibrant
colour
medium

on

dont
totally
get
it
but
definitely
a
drinkable
beer
thanks
russ
dnot
something
i
would
want
all
the
time
but
very
good
and
ill
but
it
again
would
like
to
see
how
it
ages
i
probably
trade
for
a
few
more
of
these
while
they
are
still
available
big
props
to
tim
and
jimi
jimi
is
a
fantastic
trader
and
tim
punched
me
square
in
the
tongue
with
this
one
d
at
10
5
abv
i
elt
the
weight
of
this
big
brew
but
surprizingly
drinkable
better
paired
with
food
i
had
chocolate
with
it
savored
slowly
its
an
incredible
beer
wow
a
surprisingly
solid
and
well
mannered
quad
that
looked
smelled
felt
and
tasted
like
something
right
out
of
the
belgian
realm
from
which
it
is
to
emulate
great
job
by
boulevard
on
this
one
d
bring
it
on
poured
into
a
heavy
glass
chalice
formed
a
2
beige
head
above
the
cloudy
orangey
amber
brew
thick
head
lasts
and
lasts
with
spotty
lacing
aroma
is
sweet
but
overpowered
by
strong
rubbing
alcoholish
character
taste
is
also
sweet
to
start
edging
towards
alcohol
by
the
close
and
plenty
of
warming
action
mouthfeel
is
smooth
and
drinkability
is
pretty
good
the
rubbing
alcohol
nose
does
last
however
and
puts
a
damper
on
things
kudos
to
boulevard
for
brewing
this
glad
to
have
tried
would
gladly
have
again
perfect
appearence
deep
ruby
color
with
a
full
long
lasting
head
of
a
light
tan
fairly
nice
nose
with
a

of
belgian
character
plentiful
dark

cherries

plums
and
a
touch
of
alcohol
flavor
is
loaded
with
tons
of
depth
deep
caramel
and
honey
glaze
with
dark
fruits
its
a
really
nice
beer
and
very
belgian
i
think
this
series
from
boulevard
shows
their
brewing
skill
the
first
of
the
boulevard
belgians
that
i
havent
cared
for
tastes
peppery
chocolate
clean
alcohol
sting
mild
toffee
cherry
and
streched
thin
raisiny
mild
belgiany
phenolic
character
persists
as
an
undertone
strong
carbonation
with
noticable
alcohol
to
wipe
most
of
the
sweet
of
the
palate
leaves
a
dry
residual
chocolate
in
the
aftertaste
good
drinkability
now
ill
bet
this
one
ages
to
become
fantastic
thanks
pours
a
dark
amber
brown
with
a
huge
tan
head
smells
of
alcohol
and
oak
and
a
strong
presence
of
sour
cherries
tastes
of
cinnamon
brown
sugar
and
a
slight
amount
of
earthyness
not
as
dry
as
other
quads
but
quite
good
mouthfeel
is
rich
with
massive
carbonation
drinkability
is
quite
good
especially
for
over
10
percent
alcohol
an
excellent
american
quadrupel
the
drink
ability
is
surprisingly
good
given
the
alcohol
content
but
the
strong
sweet
flavors
kept
me
from
having
more
than
two
glasses
at
one
setting
i
find
quads
to
be
a
widely
varying
style
but
one
i
am
drawn
back
to
quite
often
so
that
said
hows
the
boulevard
offering
i
found
it
quad
subdued
what
the
heck
does
that
mean
its
got
sweet
caramel
candied
fruit
malt
aspects
a
solid
belgian
yeast
aspect
the
right
color
and
a
sticky
lacing
head
its
also
boozy
and
the
flavors
while
blended
well
are
more
subdued
than
i
would
prefer
in
my
quad
worth
a
try
this
is
the
last
of
the
smokestack
series
for
me
and
i
cant
imagine
i
would
be
any
less
impressed
with
this
one
than
the
previous
three
but
i
better
make
sure
pours
a
dark
copper
with
some
almost
indiscernible
streaks
of
red
into
a
snifter
has
a
huge
foamy
tan
head
that
recedes
in
a
dilatory
fashion
leaving
little
lacing
behind
has
a
robust
and
complex
smell
of
raisins
figs
and
other
dark
fruits
with
some
alcohol
right
behind
mixed
in
with
some
big
malts
caramel
and
toffee
tastes
is
just
as
complex
as
the
smell
with
some
big
malty
creaminess
light
chocolates
caramel
sweet
bread
some
grains
dark
fruits
hops
and
some
big
alcohol
heat
bringing
up
the
rear
mouthfeel
is
medium
bodied
and
smooth
but
the
big
alcohol
heat
might
be
a
turn
off
for
some
although
is
welcomed
to
me
there
is
plenty
of
brisk
carbonation
to
keep
things
exciting
all
i
can
say
is
hell
yeah
dark
burgady
ruby
red
blend
big
airy
beige
head
is
erected
with
the
pour
it
fizzles
out
fairly
quickly
but
a
nice
little
frothy
head
has
some
staying
power
at
the
end
decent
nose
but
overall
too
sweet
smelling
blackberry
brandy
comes
to
mind
as
does
cherry
juice
and
sweet
rock
candy
i
think
this
is
appropriate
to
an
extent
but
my
nose
tells
me
its
a
little
overdone
lets
proceed
first
impressions
on
the
palate
are
spicy
sweet
yeasty
and
alcoholic
this
is
not
a
bad
take
here
on
an
extraordinary
style
brandy
soaked
figs
with
some
plum
and
raisin
a
little
of
that
spiked
punch
feel
to
it
the
alcohol
is
all
over
this
but
never
really
off
putting
rum
soaked
fruits
make
their
presence
like
apple
and
melon
lightmedium
bodied
with
a
moderate
level
of
carbonation
my
only
recommendation
here
is
maybe
a
little
less
heat
and
a
little
less
sweet
overall
though
this
is
a
good
beer
d
this
is
a
very
good
quad
i
was
really
impressed
with
boulevards
take
on
a
big
belgian
style
pours
a
murky
brown
color
with
some
reddish
hues
big
cream
colored
head
with
great
retention
and
lots
of
lacing
left
behind
aroma
is
alcohol
dark
fruits
and
spice
taste
is
a
bit
boozy
some
funky
yeast
pretty
spicy
a
bit
fruity
with
some
pears
and
raisins
mouthfeel
is
very
thin
in
my
opinion
for
a
quad
and
it
doesnt
lend
to
the
drinkability
because
of
the
high
and
noticeable
alcohol
not
bad
but
certainly
doesnt
stack
up
to
the
trappists
ive
had
drinkability
a
decent
quad
and
pleasure
to
have
tried
it
but
one
is
enough
for
me
thanks

with

this
is
not

750ml
bottle
batch

this
one
opened
with
a
loud
pop
it
poured
with
a
large
tan
head
on
it
and
was
quite
fizzy
the
color
was
a
hazy
mahogany
the
head
dropped
off
rather
quickly
the
nose
is
good
but
not
as
strong
as
i
would
have
expected
mainly
bready
and
spicy
with
traces
of
caramel
and
fruits
a
bit
of
effervescence
on
the
tongue
not
quite
full
bodied
it
took
a
couple
of
sips
to
appreciate
the
taste
subtle
hints
of
different
tastes
but
they
all
blend
well
together
nice

kick
coarse
head
is
intimidating
but
settles
to
a
decent
layer
quickly
and
fed
by
very
good

is
somewhat
complex
lots
of
carbonation
in
there
and
in
the
finish

in

transitions
to
a
subdued
malty
sweetness
finishes
strong
with
a
meddly
of

carbonation
and
alcohol
that
seems
to
go
on
forever
nice
body
to
it
but
seems
to
soften
as
it
openswarms
up
this
quadrupel
is
not
overwhelming
in
its
flavor
for
people
looking
for
a
big
brash
quadrupel
this
might
disappoint
yet
for
those
looking
for
a
good
wellcrafted
wellflavored
smooth
quad
this
should
satisfy
at
8
for
the
22
oz
bottle
its
a
little
pricey
but
certainly
enjoyable
enoughand
a
bit
boozy
enoughto
ultimately
overlook
or
plainly
forget
the
price
in
favor
of
the
flavor
definitely
recommended
d
not
too
bad
along
the
lines
of
la
trappe
quad
if
i
remember
correctly
atlanta
ale
meeting
this
one
is

the
predominent
taste
and
cloves
toasted

mouthfeel

looks
like
a
quaddrinkable
but
not
my
goto
quad
is
this
bottle
right
and
outstanding
quad
glad
i
got
the
opportunity
to
try
it
if
boulevard
is
going
to
move
in
this
direction
then
the
smokestack
series
is
a
great
start
the
regular
line
of
boulevard
brews
is
nothing
to
be
ashamed
of
but
these
smokestack
beers
seem
to
be
pretty
special
several
stretches
short
of
greatness
but
an
enjoyable
glass
or
two
or
six
drank
pretty
good
probably
needs
to
age
a
couple
of
years
to
smooth
out
some
of
the
boozeyness
went
well
with
my
christmas
dinner
goose
as
others
have
stated
im
very
happy
to
see
boulevard
going
in
this
direction
ive
suggested
the
smokestack
series
to
many
of
my
local
friends
who
havent
tried
a
whole
lot
of
exotic
beers
and
the
sixth
glass
seems
to
be
one
of
the
favorites
among
them
highly
recommended
overall
its
an
enjoyable
beer
that
has
me
excited
to
see
what
boulevard
does
with
this
new
series
notes
gotta
love
my
local
brewery
branching
out
a
bit
with
their
expanded
capacity
this
is
probably
one
of
the
finest
quads
ive
had
here
in
the
states
thats
being
pretty
picky
though
this
is
a
great
beer
that
ill
buy
again
mr
pauwels
you
are
awesome
overall
i
was
impressed
i
havent
had
too
many
american
quads
that
ive
enjoyed
this
is
one
that
i
did
enjoy
though
and
its
not
too
expensive
either
i
paid
7
50
for
the
bottle
at
red
x
in
kansas
city
stack
this
up
next
to
a
rochefort
10
or
st
bernardus
abt
12
and
it
comes
up
a
bit
short
but
its
nothing
to
sneeze
at
either
grab
a
bottle
if
you
see
it

some

in

warm
yet
dry
the
alcohol
does
make
itself
known
but
is
not
overpowering
very
well
balanced
and
drinkable
i
am
so
excited
that
boulevard
is
expanding
in
this
direction
one
of
the
best
this
years
seemed
to
have
a
little
more
burn
than
usual
but
still
excellent
wow
this
is
good
nay
great
except
maybe
for
the
lack
of
cherries
theyre
probably
stirred
in
there
somewhere
with
the
rest
of
their
fruity
brethren
but
since
the
brewer
was
up
front
about
their
subtly
imma
let
that
one
pass
crazy
easy
to
drink
and
equally
enjoyable
this
is
a
worthwhile
ode
to
the
belgian
monastic
greats
and
from
a
place
where
they
can
see
the
dead
center
of
flyover
zone
usa
this
is
a
really
interesting
and
honestly
excellent
brew
a
quad
was
a
good
choice
for
bourbon
barrels
flavor
is
more
estery
with
notes
of
pear
and
apple
perfumey
notes
abound
not
as
much
bourbon
in
flavor
but
the
alcohol
heat
is
there
bigtime
cherries
are
a
nice
complement
needs
age
to
mellow
the
heat
expensive
but
very
good
12
in
manhattan
for
750ml
bottle
not
overly
cherry
smooth
this
is
the
best
that
ive
had
in
a
long
time
i
dont
compare
beers
as
much
but
its
in
remnants
of
a
st
bernardus
if
not
better
o
excellent
ramped
up
quad
o
a
wellcrafted
quad
similar
is
some
ways
to
three
philosophers
but
superior
in
part
due
to
the
bourbon
barrel
aging
in
part
due
to
what
may
be
a
better
quad
in
the
first
place
good
sippin
ale
absolutely
recommended
i
sort
of
expected
more
bourbon
bite
but
i
think
it
plays
into
the
fruit
notes
well
that
it
is
hiding
a
bit
regardless
a
very
nice
offering
will
be
interested
in
doing
that
vertical
at
some
point
vanilla
oak
bourbon
maple
hallelujah
poured
from
a
750ml
bottle
during
a
bottle
share
pours
a
thin
golden
rust
brown
not
what
i
was
expecting
thin
head
that
dissipated
tastes
much
like
a
tradition
quadrupel
but
you
pick
up
the
oak
bourbon
barrels
the
bourbon
is
subtle
and
smooth
dark
fruit
cherries
i
think
are
noticeable
on
the
front
and
back
end
toffee
vanilla
are
noted
also
interesting
and
good
but
not
fantastic
disappointed
a
little
too
hyped
i
guess
overall
quad
fiends
would
probably
like
this
beer
i
found
it
fairly
enjoyable
but
would
not
purchase
it
again
this
is
smooth
pours
dark
and
creamy
not
overly
carbonated
has
a
nice
little
after
burn
for
all
you
barrel
drinkers
still
liked
the
widmer
brrrbon
13
had
a
little
more
of
a
bite
but
then
again
thats
coming
from
a
whiskey
drinker
who
just
switched
over
to
beers
in
the
last
3
weeks
i
def
recommend
this
beer
its
done
up
really
well
i
thoroughly
enjoyed
this
offering
and
it
is
extremely
well
balanced
it
was
released
into
the
wild
in
2014
and
i
just
picked
it
up
today
at
the
local
bevmo
as
far
as
the
abv
is
concerned
its
hardly
noticeable
especially
if
drunk
with
a
small
meal
or
snack
if
you
havent
tried
this
yet
and
youre
into
barrelaged
anything
you
should
definitely
give
this
beer
a
shot
this
is
my
2nd
time
enjoy
n
this
quad
i
hand
a
few
other
beers
and
4got
2
review
last
time
upon
2nd
try
i
found
this
overly
carbonated
so
i
let
it
settle
then
i
could
taste
the
tart
cherries
its
good
but
not
outstanding
i
like
some
of
the
other
boulevard
smokestack
series
better
overall
this
is
a
nice
complex
barrel
aged
quad
it
packs
a
punch
for
sure
i
look
forward
to
trying
next
years
version
when
it
comes
out
for
a
quad
this
is
a
little
light
i
love
the
6th
glass
i
had
high
hopes
for
the
bbq
but
was
disappointed
at
the
lack
of
flavor
coming
from
the
bourbon
barrel
happy
to
drink
it
again
if
youre
buying
the
cherries
and
bourbon
are
a
great
combo
poured
a
one
finger
tan
head
over
a
copper
colored
body
into
a
st
bernardus
goblet
from
the
corked
and
caged
bottle
immediate
whiff
of
sweet
bourbon
taste
is
immediately
of
that
bourbon
and
the
cherries
settling
into
the
familiar
character
of
a
top
flight
but
not
too
sweet
quad
spectacular
cheekpuffing
mouthfeel
an
absolute
must
for
all
quad
fans
cheers
o
reminds
me
of
a
number
of
barleywines
ive
had
but
is
far
more
nuanced
this
is
a
beer
to
sit
down
with
and
explore
because
there
are
enough
layers
here
to
reward
time
with
discovery
i
need
to
get
more
of
this
good
but
i
think
i
like
the
plain
quad
better
and
gi
for
bourbon
barrel
flavor
starts
with
cherries
followed
by
vanilla
caramel
toffee
and
oak
all
of
which
is
nicely
balanced
ends
with
a
dry
finish
overall
this
blends
the
complexity
of
a
good
belgian
with
the
power
of
a
potent
bourbon
barrel
nicely
it
drinks
a
touch
hot
but
there
are
few
nigh12
abv
barrelaged
beers
that
can
conceal
that
a
spot
of
age
might
take
a
bit
of
the
edge
off
as
well
i
dont
know
that
i
would
ever
reach
for
this
over
a
good
nonbarrelaged
quad
but
perhaps
trying
one
with
some
age
on
it
might
change
that
opinion
the
smell
of
this
stuff
is
awesome
not
too
sharp
not
too
malty
i
really
like
that
they
keep
the
belgian
character
but
with
bba
that
is
pretty
hard
to
pull
off
had
this
saved
for
over
a
year
back
from
the
2013
release
although
it
was
a
very
solid
beer
i
felt
a
little
let
down
maybe
i
kept
it
for
too
long
but
i
didnt
think
the
cherry
notes
came
through
as
strong
and
it
seemed
a
bit
strong
for
me
on
the
whole
it
was
a
good
beer
but
perhaps
i
should
try
it
fresher
than
what
i
had
it
overalli
gotta
say
i
was
pretty
disappointed
with
this
the
taste
was
very
boozy
and
it
lacked
the
sweetness
and
complexity
i
except
from
a
belgian
quad
particularly
since
this
is
brewery
generally
does
excellent
work
oh
well
this
was
actually
refreshing
compared
to
the
past
few
barrel
aged
quads
that
ive
had
this
had
a
slight
sour
layer
because
of
the
cherriesand
an
excellent
vanilla
back
note
as
the
taste
lingered
i
love
the
hints
of
cherry
throughout
this
beer
would
buy
again
serve
cool
vertical
with
vintage
2011
and
2014
the
11
had
failed
barreling
and
sone
oxidation
but
became
a
resident
of
funky
town
overall
goddamn
this
is
a
terrific
beer
i
love
the
stone
fruit
flavors
and
the
nicely
balanced
but
pronounced
alcohol
warmth
im
getting
several
bottles
of
this
beer
as
its
now
a
keeper
in
my
cellar
this
beer
has
been
on
my
radar
for
years
boulevard
just
entered
ohio
so
this
is
my
first
offering
from
them
i
can
say
im
pretty
impressed
the
craftsmanship
is
off
the
charts
this
brew
is
simply
well
executed
well
done
highly
recommended
serving
type
bottle
will
seek
this
out
again
i
am
fortunate
that
a
long
time
local
has
amassed
such
a
selection
in
a
small
store
with
limited
parking
if
you
dont
find
it
ask
kinda
place
definitely
worth
a
purchase
obbq
i
buy
2
every
year
i
drink
one
and
age
1
poured
from
a
750ml
bottle
into
a
belgian
tulip
glass
o
really
nice
the
cherries
are
great
and
the
barrel
character
adds
some
really
nice
vanilla
and
nutty
bourbon
notes
but
theres
a
little
too
much
oak
o
this
is
what
other
bourbon
barrel
aged
beers
want
to
be
when
they
grow
up
new
years
eve
so
good
i
kept
the
bottle
a
special
gift
from
my
son
who
gave
it
to
me
on
christmas
day
2013
i
cellared
it
for
a
year
and
decided
to
start
the
new
year
and
tick
off
my
10000th
beer
rating
on
ba
with
this
truly
excellent
brew
upon
pulling
the
cork
a
sweet
aroma
of
cherries
and
licorice
arise
from
the
bottle
poured
from
the
750
ml
bottle
into
a
jester
king
goblet
the
smell
is
intensified
the
head
is
thick
light
brown
in
color
with
fine
lacing
that
traces
the
glass
as
the
beer
is
quaffed
the
body
of
the
brew
is
orangebrown
with
tiny
bubbles
rising
from
below
like
champagne
the
first
sip
of
this
abbey
style
quadrupel
highlights
the
aroma
with
a
trace
of
vanilla
and
bourbon
flavor
coming
through
despite
its
11
8
abv
you
can
barely
taste
the
alcohol
which
is
layered
with
all
the
other
flavors
that
roll
around
on
your
tongue
i
know
not
many
beers
i
enjoy
this
coming
year
will
be
quite
as
grand
as
this
one
because
it
sets
the
bar
high
but
i
am
thrilled
to
be
starting
2015
with
such
a
fantastic
example
of
what
beer
can
be
the
bourbon
flavor
profile
is
not
subtle
at
all
and
can
be
very
overpowering
the
finish
feels
similar
to
a
subdued
shot
of
bourbon
this
is
not
the
best
production
coming
out
of
boulevard
o
i
will
be
seeking
this
one
out
very
soon
one
of
the
stellar
beers
to
be
savored
aged
and
then
savored
again
aged
3
yrs
opened
xmas
day
it
was
worth
the
wait
overall
it
was
the
first
boulevard
that
i
felt
didnt
far
exceed
the
general
population
in
its
respective
style
no
bueno
not
what
i
expected
at
all
i
enjoyed
the
look
of
this
beer
hazy
deep
amber
color
slight
smell
of
cherries
and
faint
barrel
something
didnt
come
together
in
the
taste
for
me
that
could
match
the
wonderful
aromas
i
was
detecting
dark
amber
color
smooth
vanilla
notes
sweet
candy
cherry
finish
overall
4
25
so
im
not
sure
what
happened
with
the
weird
taste
at
first
i
dont
think
it
was
100
operator
error
because
it
had
actually
sat
out
in
the
glass
for
10
minutes
before
i
drank
it
the
first
time
but
towards
the
end
wow
this
is
a
fantastic
beer
that
has
nearly
everything
fantastic
head
great
aroma
lingering
taste
that
lets
you
remember
good
times
this
is
not
thick
or
heavy
just
wonderful
you
will
be
transported
to
what
beer
should
be
no
defined
genera
just
fantastic
taste
and
aroma
this
is
a
beer
that
makes
me
hopeful
for
other
american
beers
o
a
big
sweet
dark
fruit
quad
with
a
well
rounded
bourbon
barrel
flavor
a
really
nice
beer
that
sticks
to
the
format
of
the
sixth
glass
this
is
a
good
beer
but
i
dont
find
the
complexity
that
others
have
on
the
nose
you
get
a
boozy
somewhat
chocolate
aroma
i
find
the
taste
very
boozy
its
11
8
abv
but
youd
think
it
was
much
higher
i
was
hoping
the
cherries
would
be
more
present
but
i
dont
taste
them
this
is
the
kind
of
beer
id
buy
for
a
friend
who
really
like
bourbon
o
boulevard
seems
to
have
a
knack
for
make
belgianstyle
beers
and
this
is
no
exception
the
bourbon
barrel
flavor
is
a
unique
and
welcome
addition
o
do
not
get
this
beer
too
cold
it
will
ruin
the
entire
effect
besides
that
pretty
damn
good
but
not
overly
boozey
like
i
like
super
balanced
despite
being
11
5
it
was
super
easy
drinking
almost
loftylight
tasting
im
going
to
save
the
other
bottle
despite
the
brewmasters
suggestion
for
a
few
more
months
as
i
think
this
one
will
only
benefit
from
a
little
more
time
all
in
all
a
good
beer
a
real
experience
ill
watch
for
other
rare
bottles
smooth
flavor
with
definite
bourbon
and
floral
aftertaste
i
wouldnt
put
it
up
there
with
good
lambics
in
flavor
but
nothing
especially
objectionable
the
flavor
just
didnt
connect
with
me
due
to
the
disparate
elements
but
it
is
good
looking
in
the
glass
and
goes
down
smoothly
on
the
palate
wow
a
fantastic
beer
sometimes
the
belgian
style
beers
dont
work
for
me
i
think
its
related
to
the
yeast
they
generally
use
however
this
one
is
delicious
first
upon
removing
the
cork
you
get
a
very
strong
pop
probably
the
strongest
of
any
beer
ive
uncorked
i
expected
high
carbonation
as
a
result
but
thats
not
the
case
carbonation
level
is
perfect
taste
is
exquisite
there
are
certainly
bourbon
barrel
overtones
practically
no
hop
bitterness
the
alcohol
is
well
hidden
but
warming
my
only
gripe
is
the
cherries
i
think
this
would
be
an
even
better
beer
without
them
easily
one
of
my
favorite
beers
and
i
am
glad
i
got
4
bottles
of
it
this
year
overall
fantastic
beer
i
enjoyed
the
sixth
glass
from
boulevard
and
am
a
sucker
for
quads
in
general
this
one
takes
it
to
another
level
with
a
vast
array
of
flavors
my
second
favorite
quad
after
stickee
monkey
which
debatably
isnt
even
a
quad
great
job
as
usual
by
boulevard

i
got

a

overall
this
is
a
very

beer
that
likely
would
be
better
without
the
cherries
great
o
this
beer
seems
to
be
suffering
from
an
identity
crisis
this
beer
is
not
what
i
expect
of
the
style
its
more
like
a
barleywine
as
i
said
above
but
even
in
the
barleywine
category
i
think
it
falters
also
this
is
a
very
bright
looking
beer
which
is
unexpected
that
said
the
beer
is
pretty
to
look
at
and
is
a
good
drink
very
tasty
and
satisfyingi
just
wouldnt
call
it
a
quad
also
the
reviewer
below
me
said
it
reminded
him
of
westvleteren
12
im
not
getting
that
at
all
overall
this
reminds
me
a
ton
of
westy
12
very
belgiany
for
an
american
brewed
belgian
style
brew
very
well
brewed
impressive
tasty
and
smooth
while
totally
different
the
2011
was
still
a
treat
i
imagine
the
problem
with
reviewing
any
2011
though
is
that
each
version
will
probably
have
massive
variation
in
how
the
souring
affects
the
beer
if
this
had
gone
very
sour
or
not
sour
enough
it
could
have
a
been
a
total
waste
anyhow
my
experience
was
pretty
fun
and
special
with
it
since
it
was
so
unexpected
picked
this
up
from
a
great
trade
with
evan
hazy
mahogany
pour
with
a
hint
of
ruby
two
finger
beige
head
with
decent
retention
and
great
lacing
the
nose
is
huge
and
amazing
tons
of
vanilla
and
oak
along
with
hints
of
bourbon
toffee
and
very
subtle
cherries
the
taste
is
big
and
bold
with
huge
oak
notes
along
with
hints
of
vanilla
bourbon
toffee
and
caramel
the
cherries
are
a
bit
more
prevalent
and
add
a
subtle
sourness
to
the
flavor
the
mouthfeel
is
smooth
and
somewhat
creamy
with
fizzy
carbonation
and
a
slightly
sour
finish
the
drinkability
for
an
11
8
beer
was
off
the
charts
overall
i
was
very
impressed
with
this
beer
the
oak
character
was
incredible
and
the
subtle
cherry
notes
added
complexity
highly
recommended
overall
this
is
definately
a
must
for
bourbon
barrel
fans
a
bit
more
thickness
in
the
body
and
this
would
have
been
near
perfect
for
me
you
know
what
actually
reminds
me
of
allagash
curieux
just
a
little
bit
that
other
bba
belgian
ive
always
thought
that
curieux
tastes
like
a
whisky
sour
with
the
oak
astringency
taking
a
forward
position
and
the
same
sort
of
flavor
dynamic
is
working
here
a
really
great
beer
enjoying
the
last
night
in
our
current
house
lots
of
memories
here
and
this
beer
will
be
one
of
them

with

light

for
the
style
which
makes
the
mouthfeel
pleasant
for
such
a
strong

overall
really
good
just
not
great
simple
profile
for
the
style
age
on
this
bottle
and
the
way
othas
smoothed
out
makes
me
think
this
one
could
go
much
longer
and
do
well
pair
with

beef
venison
redmeat

pairing
would
be

the
flavor
follows
with
dark

it
is
a
lighter

with
medium

bourbon
that
smooths
out
the
beer
with
a
clean
drinking

end
o
pretty
much
as
advertised
a
lot
of
the
quad
aspect
is
lost
underneath
all
of
the
bourbon

cherries
but
its
still
an
excellent
beer
unique

o
i
expected
a
bit
more
the
sharp
young
bourbon
didnt
do
it
for
me
im
used
to
a
much
mroe
mellow
ba
bourbon
flavor
fun
to
try
i
would
love
to
try
again
with
more
cherries
and
a
different
barrel
bold
bourbon
flavor
from
the
smell
to
the
taste
this
beer
is
all
about
the
bourbon
it
reminded
me
of
college
days
swigging
bourbon
by
the
half
gallon
very
smooth
ale
with
a
great
deal
of
character
the
aroma
of
bourbon
with
a
slight
hint
of
cherries
was
a
nice
precursor
to
the
flavor
explosion
provided
to
this
bbc
overall
quite
tasty
and

but
below
average
not
enough
of
an
estery
complexity
as
a
bourbonaged
beer
its
slightly
aboveaverage
with
a
nice
finish
actually
for
a
beer
with
such
a
light
mouthfeel
it
does
carry
the
bourbon
pretty
well
it
isnt
supercomplex
and
im
not
sure
that
aging
it
really
did
anything
for
it
but
its
nice
and
id
buy
it
again
o
4
overall
this
is
a
nice
and
interesting
beer
not
great
but
a
different
take
on
a
barrel
aged
beer
and
a
quad
o
overall
i
thought
it
was
an
okay
quad
it
wouldnt
be
my
first
choice
in
a
lineup
by
a
long
shot
but
its
good
in
a
pinch
i
didnt
get
any
bourbon
flavor
but
i
did
get
a
bit
of
oak
it
wasnt
a
spectacular
or
memorable
beer
but
it
had
a
decent
enough
flavor
profile
o
in
small
doses
its
fantastic
its
a
richly
sweet
dessert
beer
but
i
honestly
cant
drink
a
lot
of
this
honestly
im
let
down
normally
boulevards
750
are
both
rich
and
deceptively
drinkable
this
is
just
rich
absolutely
worth
trying
just
split
it
with
several
people
before
hand
first
beer
tried
from
boulevard
this
was
quite
nice
some
more
time
aging
would
make
this
one
flawless
overall
good
complex
beer
for
sipping
but
like
wine
you
do
not
drink
a
lot
of
this
at
a
time
overall
it
was
very
good
but
not
a
rich
as
a
top
notch
quad
overall
really
nice
i
like
the
balance
of
the
cherries
and
the
hint
of
bourbon
definitely
an
interesting
beer
with
a
lot
going
on
would
buy
again
16
for
22oz
just
hot
enough
with
alcohol
a
sweet
dark
dream
with
a
touch
of
fire
from
the
22
oz
bottle
bought
at
bottlecraft
in
san
diego
95100
o
i
dont
drink
many
quads
so
im
not
the
best
judge
of
this
style
but
this
is
phenomenal
as
a
beer
and
as
a
quad
the
cherries
and
barrels
add
great
complexity
to
what
im
sure
is
an
already
great
beer
well
done
boulevard
o
took
me
by
surprise
by
the
sounds
of
it
i
thought
it
would
be
like
sixth
glass
with
cherries
and
bourbon
barrels
added
aka
super
sweet
and
super
alcohol
burn
while
it
does
burn
its
a
pleasant
one
and
the
sweetness
is
more
of
a
tartness
i
think
i
ended
up
giving
it
lower
ratings
than
i
thought
i
would
but
actually
ended
up
liking
it
more
than
i
thought
i
would
if
that
makes
sense
pinkish
with
a
honey
glow
the
warm
color
of
this
beer
is
offset
slightly
by
coffeecolored
sediment
gently
collecting
at
the
base
the
lasting
white
head
leaves
appreciable
lacings
cherry
vanilla
bourbon
from
the
barrels
and
plum
are
all
present
in
the
nose
the
start
is
cherry
and
spiced
apples
but
evolves
into
a
buttery
vanilla
creme
with
a
touch
of
molasses
at
the
edges
providing
a
full
slightly
sticky
finish
outstanding
1400
would
i
buy
it
again
sure
this
is
the
first
bourbonbarrelaged
quad
ive
had
im
glad
i
bought
it
and
enjoyed
drinking
it
but
i
though
id
like
it
a
lot
more
than
i
did
it
is
definitely
an
interesting
beer
but
im
not
sure
just
how
well
the
flavors
work
here
on
my
palate
the
characteristic
dark
bready
fruity
notes
of
the
quad
meld
with
the
oaky
vanillalike
boozy
notes
of
the
bourbon
to
produce
a
profile
reminiscent
of
a
manhattan
its
a
terrific
beer
that
is
definitely
worth
exploring
but
i
still
prefer
oldschool
quads
this
beer
is
big
and
bold
and
the
perfect
american
quad
for
me
exceptional
quad
highly
complex
yet
perfectly
balanced
one
of
the
best
quads
i
have
tried
o
a
slightly
above
average
quad
enhanced
by
a
slighlty
above
average
barrel
treatment
i
feel
like
a
little
more
residual
sweetness
would
help
the
bb
aspect
and
more
dark
fruity
esters
might
help
the
overall
beer
i
like
it
but
wasnt
blown
away
overall
this
was
a
disappointment
for
me
for
my
palate
neither
the
cherries
nor
the
barrel
aging
worked
not
something
i
would
want
to
try
again
o
the
barrel
notes
mixes
nicely
with
the
light
cherry
tartness
the
only
downside
is
its
really
boozy
when
fresh
i
usually
like
strong
tasting
beers
but
this
seemed
to
detect
from
the
malty
sweetness
of
the
base
quad
a
year
of
aging
in
the
bottle
may
have
made
this
one
a
true
winner
overall
this
was
a
treat
an
american
belgian
that
tastes
like
a
belgian
no
major
faults
not
even
any
minors
faults
for
that
matter
just
nit
picks
that
dont
amount
to
much
easy
to
drink
in
general
but
especially
for
a
quad
very
happy
with
this
purchase
overall
picked
up
a
bottle
down
in
iowa
it
surprised
me
with
how
much
the
flavors
leaned
towards
wine
when
compared
to
other
quads
the
bourbon
barrel
aging
didnt
really
make
much
of
an
impression
either
a
bit
of
a
letdown
o
this
beer
is
listed
at
11
8
and
when
you
taste
it
youd
think
it
were
more
this
is
another
beer
that
id
say
the
bourbon
barrel
subtracted
from
what
could
have
been
an
amazing
cherry
quad
too
much
oak
and
an
overwhelming
alcohol
presence
im
torn
though
because
hidden
under
the
barrel
i
can
sense
the
great
tart
dark
fruit
beer
there
wish
i
could
taste
more
of
the
yeast
a
bit
disappointing
but
still
a
complex
beer
that
has
some
nuances
wish
all
the
flavors
were
just
a
delicate
o
4
75
this
is
a
great
quad
definitely
up
there
with
the
abt
12
rochefort
10
group
ill
definitely
age
the
next
one
o
if
you
like
quads
its
a
must
try
a
really
nice
spin
on
the
style
o
its
good
but
nothing
special
it
has
a
cork
you
just
upped
the
price
a
bit
congrats
barrel
aged
with
cherries
lets
see
it
looks
like
super
strong
homemade
tea
i
hate
tea
just
kidding
i
love
tea
but
this
review
is
not
biased
so
shut
it
charitable
head
no
retention
no
problem
smells
of
faint
cherries
must
ya
i
smoke
ciggies
dont
trust
my
nose
tastes
of
figs
have
i
ever
had
figs
or
have
i
just
had
a
lot
of
quads
cherries
non
sour
the
kind
chillis
restaurant
carries
bourbon
lemme
point
out
that
it
is
a
muttled
amount
of
bourbon
you
know
the
warm
kind
that
comes
from
bourbon
barrel
aging
if
im
wrong
mail
me
your
foot
so
you
can
kick
me
in
the
teeth
big
body
easy
carbo
i
think
im
too
far
gone
i
took
the
roller
coaster
i
started
with
the
godhead
bud
miller
coors
then
i
went
belgium
then
american
craft
then
only
drinking
insane
crafts
then
back
to
cheap
beer
now
at
crafts
again
but
i
cant
fully
enjoy
great
craft
brew
because
my
fondest
memories
are
stuck
in
the
past
during
my
discovery
stage
all
of
my
personal
beer
psychology
set
aside
this
is
a
good
brew
dont
pay
more
than
12
for
this
great
booze
great
flavor
but
im
not
rich
motha
fudge
o
enjoyable
twist
on
a
belgian
quad
the
barrel
aging
and
introduction
of
the
cherries
adds
to
the
experience
a
nice
treat
o
great
bourbon
beer
another
great
boulevard
beer
pours
a
reddish
brown
with
one
finger
khaki
head
that
had
minor
head
and
lace
thanks
to
some
lively
carbonation
tart
cherries
do
come
through
in
the
aroma
as
does
some
slightly
boozy
oakines
and
hints
of
dark
fruits
like
toffee
and
a
little
bit
of
yeast
smooth
medium
to
heavy
bodied
the
yeast
and
barrel
aging
keep
the
beer
smooth
and
not
too
sharp
although
there
is
a
crisp
finish
as
the
beer
has
a
good
amount
of
carbonation
great
balance
of
vanilla
toffee
and
other
sugary
sweetness
and
some
figs
and
dark
fruit
and
those
tart
cherries
have
some
play
as
well
great
sipper
and
the
booze
is
kept
under
wraps
so
its
not
too
harsh
as
it
warms
very
drinkable
for
the
abv
there
is
a
lot
of
flavor
here
about
the
only
complaint
i
have
is
that
the
sweetness
takes
away
a
bit
from
the
belgian
character
but
that
is
a
very
minor
complaint
i
feel
that
boulevard
nails
belgian
beers
better
than
any
us
brewery
i
have
tried
and
this
one
is
no
exception
it
is
very
authentic
to
the
style
had
i
tried
this
now
knowing
who
made
it
id
swear
it
came
from
belgium
overall
this
is
incredibly
complex
and
delicious
it
lived
up
to
my
expectations
which
is
a
rare
feat
i
hope
to
drink
this
again
m
medium
bodied
plus
great
carbonation
for
the
style
fairly
smooth
not
quite
a
sipper
overall
a
very
enjoyable
well
made
beer
would
happily
have
again
high
b
oi
had
very
high
hopes
for
this
beer
but
am
somewhat
disappointed
the
overwhelming
dose
of
brandyflavored
booze
is
tough
to
ignore
and
the
beer
seems
to
lack
a
lot
of
the
things
that
i
enjoy
about
quads
i
e
dark
fruit
leather
tobacco
and
sweetness
criticisms
aside
there
is
some
complexity
here
and
i
will
be
curious
to
see
if
this
thing
mellows
a
bit
over
time
o
all
over
the
place
clashing
flavors
and
over
carbonated
not
recommended
overall
a
really
great
twist
on
a
belgian
quad
good
fruit
and
spice
presence
with
a
big
kick
of
bourbon
and
cherries
it
all
comes
together
great
overall
not
totally
what
i
expected
but
not
a
bad
beer
i
can
see
why
so
many
people
love
this
one
but
im
not
one
of
them
o
it
would
be
nice
if
the
yeast
didnt
overpower
the
barrel
character
so
much
but
thats
being
nitpicky
way
too
easy
to
drink
for
being
11
8
but
its
still
a
sipper
because
of
the
complexity
definitely
worth
trying
if
youre
a
fan
of
americanstyle
quads
while
i
prefer
this
to
sixth
glass
and
it
really
is
enjoyable
this
almost
strikes
me
as
a
quad
light
this
ranks
high
among
american
quads
ive
had
but
for
my
tastes
its
still
quite
a
stretch
from
the
belgian
and
trappist
greats
no
naysaying
intended
this
is
a
quality
brew
that
im
happy
to
have
tried
and
i
plan
to
enjoy
again
in
the
future
murky

finishes
with

dark

notes
belgian

caramel
toasted

dark

and
booze
oit
started
off
too
much
cherries
and
not
enough
bourbon
but
as
it
warmed
it
balanced
out
and
became
a
much
better
beer
overall
its
not
like
most
quads
and
strangely
the
barrel
aging
doesnt
seem
to
be
giving
this
much
love
on
the
palate
or
needed
depth
o
really
like
6th
glass
quad
so
i
was
looking
forward
to
trying
this
but
i
dont
think
the
bourbon
barrel
and
cherries
made
it
better
different
more
complex
not
necessarily
better
overall
really
good
beer
that
seems
misrepresented
i
might
not
buy
this
again
but
it
is
worth
a
try
i
wanted
a
deeper
quad
but
got
a
very
airy
example
very
syrupy
very
sweet
still
good
i
stand
by
the
assertion
that
this
tastes
like
an
old
fashioned
good
thing
i
like
old
fashioneds
that
is
a
caveat
to
those
who
are
looking
for
more
traditional
quads
an
excellent
beer
copper
to
reddish
color
and
medium
head
tastes
of
toffee
and
cherries
make
an
irresistable
taste
goes
down
pretty
smooth
for
a
beer
in
a
higher
alcohol
content
this
beer
will
warm
you
right
up
boulevard
brewing
has
done
it
again
i
dont
think
i
have
found
a
product
by
them
that
i
dislike
o
a
great
quad
with
an
awesome
cherry
flavor
and
a
good
amount
of
bourbon
the
description
say
the
cherries
and
very
subtle
but
i
find
them
to
be
the
biggest
flavor
in
the
beer
and
the
one
i
noticed
first
very
happy
that
this
is
only
13
99
i
will
be
picking
up
more
overall
holy
crap
this
beer
could
make
trappists
scream
in
their
abbeys
this
is
like
taking
the
best
beers
of
the
old
world
mixing
them
with
cherries
americas
best
bourbon
barrels
and
fairy
dust
and
coming
out
with
a
beer
that
could
make
a
grown
man
cry
seriously
its
that
good
i
need
to
buy
more
bottles
o
again
best
beer
i
have
had
from
boulevard
but
not
sure
what
to
expect
in
the
future
from
them
i
would
not
put
this
on
my
list
of
favorites
but
a
nice
change
of
pace
from
my
usual
stout
fixation
overall
a
solid
quad
and
the
aging
in
barrels
has
done
this
sixth
glass
wonders
o
not
only
an
interesting
twist
on
the
style
but
very
well
done
its
very
very
good
i
bought
two
bottles
with
the
intention
of
cellaring
one
but
i
dont
think
cellaring
long
will
benefit
this
much
its
balanced
very
well
and
there
arent
any
flavors
that
i
think
will
benefit
from
time
ill
be
sure
to
drink
the
other
bottle
sooner
rather
than
later
t
brown
sugar
candi
sugar
raisin
skin
and
some
slightly
nutty
malt
some
lightly
spiced
oak
notes
come
through
on
the
finish
with
some
light
vanilla
and
booze
to
me
it
finishes
a
bit
weak
a
good
beer
but
the
barrel
notes
dont
show
as
much
as
id
like
the
review
that
the
bottle
gives
you
is
quite
spot
on
except
i
think
theres
a
bit
more
cherry
then
theyre
portraying
i
feel
as
if
the
cherry
is
in
the
forefront
and
the
toffeeraisinvanillaoak
take
a
back
seat
very
interesting
beer
not
one
to
drink
by
yourself
a
superb
beer
and
one
of
my
favorites
from
boulevard
bourbon
dominates
all
aspects
but
with
a
smoothness
that
doesnt
drown
the
complexities
underneath
o
this
quad
has
a
bold
nose
a
complex
palate
and
a
pleasing
mouthfeel
as
far
as
im
concerned
thats
the
holy
trinity
the
only
thing
i
didnt
like
about
this
beer
was
that
i
only
had
one
bottle
0
definitely
worth
picking
up
if
you
like
bourbon
imho
this
makes
a
nice
winter
warmer
for
those
crisp
nights
o
this
is
a
very
good
beer
it
lived
up
to
my
expectations
and
then
some
i
wish
this
had
distro
in
wi
and
i
would
be
getting
it
more
maybe
with
the
duvel
acquisition
it
will
hit
wi
o
a
nice
beer
that
would
probably
be
better
with
age
overall
very
good
beer
one
of
my
favorites
great
bourbon
notes
good
flavor
and
smell
very
drinkable
the
feel
was
airy
yet
smooth
and
hid
the
11
5
pct
abv
exceptionally
well
who
cant
resist
bourbon
barrel
with
cherries
quality
bourbon
used
herenot
sure
whose
barrels
but
its
damn
fine
quite
a
few
offerings
in
here
and
im
loving
the
souring
aspect
expect
to
nap
after
this
one
great
drinking
here
on
an
autumn
sunday
watching
football
o
a
pretty
good
beer
a
unique
twist
on
the
style
and
a
beer
worth
trying
o
very
interesting
this
beer
smells
like
a
sour
ale
but
taste
isnt
sour
one
of
my
favorite
beers
from
the
brewery
o
recommended
bb
treatment
obvious
but
not
overdone
mouthfeel
is
great
medium
bodied
and
moderate
carbonation
keeps
this
drinkable
light
sweetness
and
mild
tang
from
the
yeast
gives
it
a
crisp
finish
o
amazing
huge
flavorful
beer
i
surprisingly
enjoyed
this
one
more
than
rochefort
10
possibly
because
i
absolutely
love
cherries
and
cherry
flavor
boulevard
hits
another
home
run
with
this
one
overall
a
unique
twist
on
a
quad
but
i
feel
like
the
bourbon
character
isnt
all
that
well
integrated
with
the
base
beer
the
sweetness
is
almost
overpowering
i
enjoyed
it
but
its
not
my
favorite
member
of
the
smokestack
series
with
the
possible
exception
of
saisonbrett
this
is
probably
the
best
beer
that
boulevard
brews
a
complex
delicious
quad
with
portlike
flavors
coming
forth
if
you
lay
it
down
for
a
couple
of
years
i
look
forward
to
this
release
all
year
and
always
pair
it
off
with
one
of
the
previous
years
releases
if
you
get
it
try
not
to
serve
it
too
cold
really
should
be
served
at
cellar
temperature
overall
a
beer
that
stars
in
the
aroma
and
flavor
im
not
wild
about
the
look
or
the
mouthfeel
but
seeing
as
how
those
are
the
two
lessinterfering
traits
of
a
beer
i
can
easily
look
past
them
i
have
another
bottle
of
this
that
i
will
age
to
see
how
the
flavors
develop
overall
quad
aged
in
bourbon
barrels
yes
please
a
quad
like
sixth
glass
is
solid
but
age
it
in
barrels
for
several
years
and
that
steps
things
up
2011
batch
was
very
delicious
11
99
for
750
ml
this
is
up
there
with
the
very
best
that
boulevard
has
to
offer
lightweights
and
noncommited
beer
drinkers
might
consider
sharing
this
duh
but
i
had
no
trouble
sipping
it
down
by
myself
over
a
few
hours
a
highly
recommended
beer
and
a
truly
unique
one
o
this
is
a
fantastic
beer
i
bought
two
to
age
one
of
them
and
i
am
very
glad
i
did
o
look
forward
to
checking
this
bottle
out
in
a
few
years
after
its
aged
a
bit
cant
wait
for
the
booze
to
drop
out
and
for
it
to
get
deeper
wish
it
had
more
deep
dark
quaddy
notes
to
it
overall
a
great
beer
true
to
this
new
style
would
def
have
again
the
bourbon
is
a
compliment
and
not
overpowering
like
in
some
bourbon
aged
beers
pretty
tasty
tastes
feels
stronger
than
the
stated
11

abv
be
careful
with
this
one
astmo
bottle
was
contaminated
shame
poured
a
murky
brownish
red
and
had
tons
of
floaties
good
aroma
slight
bourbon
but
it
stopped
there
a
real
disappointment
mouthfeel
was
actually
quite
good
but
was
due
to
the
wild
overgrowth
of
yeast
im
going
to
first
thank
fellow
ba
blueokie
for
giving
me
this
interesting
barrel
aged
quad
the
alcohol
wanted
to
take
over
the
taste
but
the
oak
and
company
saved
it
however
the
oak
couldnt
hold
back
the
alcohol
in
the
mouthfeel
pick
your
battles
i
guess
its
a
very
good
beer
the
bourbon
barrel
aging
added
some
nice
characteristics
to
this
beer
i
would
drink
it
again
if
i
had
the
chance
mildly
underwhelmed
by
this
pours
a
brassy
copper
color
a
little
hazy
with
some
good
suds
on
top
and
a
slow
going
southern
sort
of
feeling
about
it
the
nose
is
a
touch
smoky
a
lot
alcoholy
and
plenty
sweet
as
well
with
a
huge
grain
bill
and
enough
woody
bourbon
notes
to
bring
me
down
to
kentucky
on
an
imaginary
horse
i
like
this
fresh
better
than
aged
as
the
older
version
2010
thins
out
quite
a
bit
loses
its
more
tasty
sweet
elements
and
takes
on
a
peculiar
cocktail
sauce
horseradish
funk
that
just
doesnt
belong
in
a
beer
at
least
not
in
a
quad
fresh
through
the
vanilla
is
large
and
the
wood
is
campy
and
mature
there
is
a
statesman
quality
about
this
formal
in
a
way
but
lax
enough
to
kick
the
shoes
off
too
a
good
mix
not
arrogant
but
certainly
not
laying
low
in
the
background
either
this
is
a
robust
beer
with
just
enough
carbonation
and
a
little
less
body
than
most
american
made
quads
i
appreciate
it
for
what
it
is
but
would
not
that
its
overpriced
and
a
must
share
bottle
at
almost
12
abv
get
it
while
you
can
i
dont
think
its
being
made
anymore
cloudy
caramel
pour
and
i
was
surprised
at
the
active
foamy
head
that
formed
though
this
soon
sank
down
to
a
thin
layer
and
left
a
few
streaks
of
lacing
on
the
glass
aroma
of
smashed
cherries
brown
sugar
and
a
mix
of
bourbon
and
fusel
alcohol
tastes
of
brown
sugar
vanilla
candi
sugar
dark
fruit
notes
and
oak
soaked
in
bourbon
and
moonshine
with
the
woodiness
taking
an
edge
over
the
booziness
medium
body
moderate
carbonation
enjoyable
but
not
very
smooth
and
maybe
a
bit
too
messy
still
a
solid
brew
overall
the
beer
is
cloudy
reddish
amber
with
a
layer
of
off
white
head
that
sticks
around
the
carbonation
is
tingly
and
the
body
isnt
as
thick
as
i
expected
brilliantly
done
boulevard
this
brew
i
will
seek
out
again
and
again
and
again
pours
a
ruddy
garnet
shade
with
a
generous
23
finger
head
that
dissipates
rather
quickly
with
absolutely
zero
lacing
the
nose
is
straight
up
sour
cherries
it
has
a
real
tart
nose
with
a
slight
bit
of
funk
dark
and
candied
fruit
scents
mix
in
nicely
the
bourbon
isnt
overly
apparent
at
this
point
the
taste
is
more
cherries
nice
and
tart
but
far
from
sour
its
so
well
played
the
bourbon
again
is
subtle
its
not
dominant
which
is
actually
good
probably
one
of
the
best
examples
of
well
executed
bourbon
barreling
for
a
person
that
hates
sours
or
quads
im
diggin
this
the
mouth
is
nice
and
crisp
good
carb
a
nice
tartness
and
a
finsih
thats
a
tad
bitter
the
alcohol
is
indeed
present
at
this
stage
overall
this
is
a
winner
o
very
impressive
my
appreciation
of
quads
can
vary
wildly
but
this
one
hit
the
flavors
i
like
quite
a
bit
on
a
side
note
if
they
did
this
exact
same
process
cherry
fermenting
with
the
same
barrel
aging
combo
with
an
ris
for
a
base
beer
the
potential
is
through
the
roof
smells
interesting
tastes
like
its
name
this
is
not
a
good
thing
lacks
a
little
dimension
bourbon
plus
a
quad
in
the
case
of
this
beer
the
bourbon
elements
seem
to
overpower
the
quad
elements
this
is
not
particularly
bad
but
its
not
particularly
good
the
notes
of
cherry
are
interesting
overall
a
bit
boozy
close
to
brown
color
almost
no
head
its
as
expected
interesting
a
mixture
of
bourbon
and
the
fruitiness
it
has
a
very
interesting
smokiness
to
it
and
the
bourbon
isnt
too
overpowering
but
it
is
still
very
hot
there
is
a
huge
apple
cider
cherry
feel
to
this
one
also
the
fruitiness
makes
this
beer
surprisingly
tart
also
i
wouldnt
drink
this
one
alone
i
felt
a
little
loopy
after
only
having
half
very
smooth
going
down
like
a
good
liquor
hints
of
cherries
are
on
the
back
end
im
guessing
the
age
may
have
diminished
it
a
bit
excellent
character
from
the
barrel
a
bit
hot
on
the
end
from
a
boozy
thing
but
if
its
kept
chilled
that
doesnt
show
as
much
o
ive
enjoyed
this
beer
more
with
a
couple
of
years
on
it
but
its
still
quite
tasty
probably
better
to
split
a
750ml
with
someone
than
to
tackle
it
alone

and
a

but
a
nice
flavor
progression
well
done
i
will
age
a
few
of
these
o
it
was
decent
all
the
way
around
and
was
lacking
lots
of
qualities
that
a
traditional
quad
usually
has
such
as
yeasty
complex
dark
fruit
character
overall
its
delicious
but
because
of
the
bourbon
more
than
the
underlying
quad
i
cant
really
tell
if
its
a
good
quad
back
there
at
all
overall
not
for
the
faint
hearted
rich
in
bourbon
and
dark
fruit
originally
reviewed
01162012
overall
an
excellent
quad
and
one
that
i
would
get
again
i
like
the
combination
of
oak
and
grapes
i
would
say
i
would
get
ryeonrye
over
this
but
this
is
still
a
great
offering
from
boulevard
2011
vintage
pours
a
reddishbown
almost
mahogany
color
with
a
small
white
head
that
disappears
quickly
scent
is
dark
fruits
at
first
with
a
good
amount
of
bourbon
and
sweet
cherries
somewhat
of
a
tart
aroma
as
well
most
likely
due
to
the
whiskey
a
good
amount
of
vanilla
and
oak
as
well
taste
is
not
what
i
was
expecting
with
an
immediate
somewhat
tart
cherry
flavor
the
tartness
immediately
turns
to
sweet
cherry
and
vanilla
with
nice
oak
presence
lovely
whiskey
flavors
throughout
along
with
a
bouquet
of
dark
fruits
a
little
bit
of
chocolate
as
well
mouthfeel
is
medium
bodied
with
moderate
carbonation
drinkability
is
high
for
such
a
rich
and
high
abv
beer
overall
this
is
another
great
beer
from
boulevard
so
lucky
to
have
such
a
great
friend
who
lives
in
kansas
o
overall
a
good
complex
and
interesting
beer
from
boulevard
it
is
definitely
interesting
as
it
brings
a
lot
of
different
flavors
it
has
a
strong
influence
from
the
bourbon
and
the
cherries
it
does
well
to
bring
each
flavor
boldly
however
i
wish
they
were
a
little
better
blended
together
as
the
transition
from
bourbon
to
sour
and
funk
is
a
little
rough
overall
well
at
least
it
wasnt
infected
this
was
an
interesting
beer
but
it
wasnt
really
as
advertised
a
little
too
cherry
heavy
for
me
especially
considering
its
supposed
to
be
a
bourbon
barrel
aged
quad
a
nice
drink
that
i
am
glad
to
have
tried
but
not
something
ill
look
for
again
cheers
for
sharing
doops
another
successful
beer
night
o
this
is
an
amazing
beer
that
holds
up
well
to
a
few
years
the
bourbon
fades
but
the
harshness
does
as
well
well
done
once
again
boulevard
overall
this
is
really
a
neat
beer
great
use
of
barrel
aging
a
style
that
doesnt
get
barrel
aged
too
frequently
this
is
my
favorite
smokestack
series
beer
by
boulevard
without
a
doubt
i
havent
had
many
smokestack
series
beers
but
bbq
sets
the
bar
really
high
for
this
brewery
this
is
my
4th
favorite
quad
that
i
have
drank
and
its
not
far
behind
these
top
three
westy12
rochefort
10
and
st
bernardus
12
o
overall
this
is
a
pretty
nice
bourbon
quad
i
think
its
still
a
bit
too
muddledhot
right
now
and
would
definitely
stand
to
be
aged
for
some
time
the
body
and
character
are
top
notch
such
a
smooth
and
easy
drinking
beer
of
such
complexity
and
richness
deserves
the
accolades
it
has
received
m
medium
to
full
carbonated
fairly
well

on
this
has
caramel

wood
some
cherry
too
bbq
has
taste
with
wood
quite
a
bit
of
bourbon
and
some
vanilla
mmm
if
you
like
quads
and
bourbon
this
is
a
good
choice
mouthfeel
is
full
a
velvet
like
texture
a
very
nice
beer
that
lived
up
to
its
hype
for
me
purchased
at
johns
grocery
in
iowa
city
this
beer
pours
a
dark
brownreddish
color
with
a
thick
head
aroma
of
sugar
cherries
oak
and
alcohol
flavor
of
cherries
sugar
and
a
whiskey
flavor
a
little
too
much
for
me
its
been
a
while
since
ive
had
it
so
i
wouldnt
mind
going
back
and
revisiting
a
bottle
to
see
if
my
tastes
of
changed
o
amazing
offering
from
boulevard
looking
forward
to
trying
more
of
the
smokestack
series
6th
glass
and
bbq
have
been
great
so
far
cracking
open
a
seeyoulator
sometime
soon
this
was
a
really
enjoyable
quad
i
did
expect
to
taste
some
bourbon
though
even
without
that
i
think
it
stands
among
the
best
quads
available
i
dont
see
the
connection
to
making
beer
taste
like
bourbon
if
you
want
to
try
this
beer
without
buying
it
take
a
glass
of
wine
and
toss
in
a
shot
of
bourbon
overall
this
is
a
very
complex
and
intriguing
brew
the
marriage
of
classic
belgian
quad
favors
and
bourbon
barrels
is
perfect
overall
this
is
definitely
better
than
the
sixth
glass
core
beer
because
the
cherries
and
oak
really
help
to
combat
the
sweetness
not
that
the
sixth
glass
is
bad
it
is
great
just
a
wee
bit
too
sweet
boulevard
is
fantastic
at
belgian
beers
and
barrel
aging
and
this
shows
off
both
those
strengths
just
docking
it
ever
so
slightly
because
i
personally
dont
care
for
too
much
cherry
taste
is
unique
dark
fruit
such
as
cherries
and
plums
a
tartness
not
often
seen
in
a
beer
like
this
an
underlying
sweetness
that
seems
to
balance
this
out
slight
notes
of
earth
and
malt
very
tasty
slightly
dry
finish
and
not
overly
carbonated
very
tasty
brew
minimal
light
head
and
minor
lacing
smells
of
yeast
and
bourbon
warming
alcohols
not
much
for
hops
pretty
strong
stuff
i
did
not
like
this
as
much
as
the
triple
from
boulevard
perhaps
it
was
just
the
bourbon
barrel
and
my
taste
thought
it
was
just
ok
o
a
fine
abbey
quad
should
be
an
interesting
beer
to
age
for
a
year
or
two
pours
a
murky
honey
orange
with
no
head
and
no
lace
smell
is
quite
fruity
with
some
vanilla
wood
and
bourbon
aromas
taste
is
of
bourbon
vanilla
and
wood
up
front
with
a
fruity
aftertaste
this
beer
has
a
good
level
of
carbonation
with
a
crisp
mouthfeel
overall
this
is
a
good
barrel
aged
beer
but
it
tastes
better
than
it
smells
next
time
it
comes
out
ill
buy
a
case
what
a
birthday
beer
thanks
gried
overall
i
wouldve
liked
more
of
the
quad
to
show
through
i
think
the
cherries
really
muddle
things
and
the
overall
focus
of
the
beer
seems
lost
this
beer
sounded
delicious
and
i
was
really
looking
forward
to
it
for
awhile
but
i
was
a
bit
let
down
maybe
just
a
bourbon
barrel
quad
without
the
cherries
wouldve
worked
better
o
i
think
this
beer
pretty
darn
good
its
a
complicated
mix
of
flavors
and
quads
arent
really
my
thing
but
id
drink
this
beer
again
mo
heavy
body
perfectly
carbonated
that
is
chewy
on
the
plate
and
finishes
slightly
acidic
the
aftertaste
has
a
mellow
bourbon
flavor
and
hardly
any
alcohol
burn
excellent
drinker
and
the
barrel
treatment
compliments
the
style
perfectly
and
the
addition
of
cherries
is
genius
will
seek
this
one
again
for
sure
o
another
great
beer
from
boulevard
the
combination
of
bourbon
and
cherries
is
great
a
nice
sipper
that
i
enjoyed
throughout
the
evening
thanks
again
lee
overall
a
really
wellrounded
beer
not
a
lifechanger
but
so
worth
finding
trade
for
it
if
you
have
to
well
balanced
but
not
a
great
interpretation
of
the
style
a
fun
beer
in
many
ways
a
total
success
for
me
i
think
boulevard
nailed
it
i
would
truly
doubt
that
id
ever
peg
this
for
a
quad
but
as
a
dark
sour
in
the
vein
of
bourbonic
plague
or
veritas
009
this
one
crushes
it
o
a
good
beer
i
will
be
revisiting
and
not
what
i
expected
in
a
quad
this
beer
pours
a
dark
amber
brown
with
little
lacing
head
the
beer
presents
strong
notes
of
bourbon
and
cherries
especially
when
warmer
however
the
taste
is
unexpectedly
mild
but
it
still
sits
like
bourbon
in
your
stomach
mediumfull
bodied
fruity
boozy
yeasty
mouthfeel
there
is
an
unexpectedly
dry
finish
tannins
cherries
and
does
a
nice
job
masking
the
alcohol
i
dig
this
beer
and
think
it
does
a
nice
job
bringing
together
the
yeast
and
fruit
from
the
quad
and
the
big
barrel
characteristics
from
the
bourbon
casks
fuller
medium
body
decent
carbonation
pretty
sticky
and
lingering
on
the
tongue
i
can
see
why
some
people
might
not
like
this
boozy
heat
tart
cherry
and
not
quite
the
typical
quad
but
ive
had
it
a
couple
times
and
continue
to
enjoy
it
i
just
wish
i
didnt
have
to
trade
to
get
this
overall
i
had
tried
to
determine
whether
this
beer
had
any
sour
characteristics
prior
to
purchase
and
the
feedback
was
more
along
the
lines
of
maybe
maybe
not
let
me
remove
all
doubt
it
does
i
will
review
this
beer
as
a
quad
and
as
such
it
is
a
major
failure
i
love
belgian
quads
and
strong
dark
ales
they
are
my
favorite
styles
of
beer
byfar
i
loathe
sour
beers
all
i
can
say
if
you
make
a
sour
beer
call
it
a
sour
beer
if
i
didnt
know
better
id
call
this
an
infected
quad
oeasily
one
of
the
better
quads
ive
had
and
one
more
success
from
boulevards
smokestack
series
in
my
humble
opinion
the
complexities
of
this
beer
are
a
little
offputting
some
flavors
play
well
together
but
some
dont
this
boulevard
offering
is
definitely
a
sipper
and
its
decently
enjoyable
but
i
dont
understand
the
hype
one
bit
slightly
above
average
at
best
o
im
not
typically
a
fan
of
the
bourbon
barrel
beers
but
this
one
is
very
well
balanced
and
utilizes
the
bourbon
flavors
in
concordance
with
the
flavors
of
the
beer
still
a
sipping
beer
unless
you
want
to
crawl
to
bed
well
done
would
love
to
cellar
a
couple
of
these
and
sample
them
at
1
and
2
years
out
o
cellar
time
i
have
not
had
a
quad
in
awhile
and
this
is
a
nice
american
fusion
im
glad
it
had
the
cherries
with
the
bourbon
because
without
them
i
think
it
would
have
been
a
bit
flat
very
nice
red
amber
with
a
thick
cream
colored
head
that
fades
quickly
but
leaves
behind
some
spots
of
lace
smells
great
very
complex
bourbon
first
then
some
funky
cherry
vanilla
flavor
is
fruity
at
first
then
the
bourbon
kicks
in
and
finishes
a
bit
dry
very
smooth
and
easy
to
drink
could
be
my
new
favorite
quad
this
was
much
better
than
expected
the
bourbon
is
nonexistent
at
first
but
shyly
comes
out
after
some
time
the
cherries
are
excellent
and
fresh
and
are
reminiscent
of
a
great
wild
ale
boulevard
definitely
has
a
great
hand
at
making
unique
belgian
style
ales
and
this
may
be
their
best
example
i
will
probably
buy
another
bottle
to
age
mf
medium
bodied
with
a
perfect
amount
of
carbonation
watery
wimpy
and
sloppy
compared
to
better
bourbon
beers
such
as
gi
or
backwoods
bastard
im
off
the
bandwagon
on
this
one
overall
this
was
an
amazing
quad
i
thoroughly
enjoyed
my
glassful
of
this
and
am
happy
that
i
have
a
couple
of
2011s
cant
wait
to
see
what
this
one
tastes
like
fresh
pours
murky
brown
with
a
good
off
white
head
that
slowly
fades
and
leaves
some
lacing
on
the
glass
the
nose
is
upfront
with
tart
cherry
oak
leather
biscuit
and
banana
bread
the
taste
is
pretty
big
with
cherry
some
definite
bourbon
notes
with
vanilla
clove
dates
alcohol
medium
bodied
with
a
little
burn
a
little
bit
harsh
this
is
a
good
beer
and
i
think
a
little
time
would
do
some
good
things
to
it
o
i
cant
tell
whether
i
will
enjoy
this
more
fresh
or
aged
probably
keep
some
bottles
in
the
fridge
to
try
to
reduce
the
aging
affect
until
i
have
some
more
with
age
on
them
it
is
great
right
now
so
i
dont
want
to
lose
that
i
heard
this
years
batch
was
a
little
more
limited
than
normal
so
next
year
i
really
plan
to
stock
up
on
this
not
a
beer
i
could
drink
all
day
everyday
but
a
glass
or
two
once
a
week
would
do
a
body
good
great
job
boulevard
im
going
back
to
clean
out
the
rest
of
these
i
wish
the
taste
came
through
like
the
aroma
but
a
pretty
good
beer
anyway
id
recommend
seeking
it
out
this
is
the
color
of
fig
puree
brown
and
foamy
theres
a
big
bourbon
aroma
that
steps
out
and
smacks
you
in
the
olfactory
nerves
pow
cleary
boozy
but
dont
say
it
doesnt
warn
you
aroma
rounded
out
by
some
sweet
stone
fruits
aged
on
cherries
yup
its
here
in
a
subtle
layered
way
tastes
of
bourbon
sweetness
with
some
heat
again
upfront
followed
by
notes
of
dark
cherries
and
some
raisins
too
great
lasting
finish
thins
out
as
it
warms
up
where
it
could
use
a
little
more
heft
but
thats
a
minor
quibble
on
an
otherwise
allaround
enjoyable
albeit
big
beer
share
this
one
overall
a
really
impressive
complex
tasty
and
reasonably
priced
quad
the
barrel
notes
are
there
and
not
overwhelming
in
the
least
definitely
a
beer
i
plan
on
getting
again
pours
dark
amber
in
color
with
a
fantastic
oaky
arouma
i
was
originaly
worried
when
i
saw
the
word
cherry
on
the
label
but
it
was
a
perfect
compliment
to
the
beer
very
high
in
alcohol
at
11
5
but
they
hid
the
booze
quite
nicely
so
dont
take
this
beer
lightly
45
moutfeel
is
perfect
for
the
style
nice
and
thick
this
is
the
best
quad
ive
tasted
in
a
long
time
i
would
go
as
far
as
to
say
i
like
it
more
than
any
belgian
quad
i
have
tasted
except
possibly
ba
latrappe
quad
they
are
both
different
animals
but
they
are
both
equally
amazing
get
a
few
of
these
to
age
funny
that
i
just
noticed
that
it
said
aged
in
the
barrels
with
cherries
i
dont
think
i
taste
the
cherries
possibly
what
i
think
is
brett
might
be
a
weird
cherry
tasted
imparted
probably
cherries
now
that
i
think
of
it
but
tasted
like
a
real
light
brett
reveal
is
bourbon
barrel
quad
oh
my
gosh
explains
so
much
i
always
forget
bbq
is
aged
on
cherries
so
much
explained
by
that
little
bit
of
knowledge
ill
have
another
o
this
stuff
is
awesome
this
beer
is
just
so
heavy
on
the
bourbon
notes
which
really
compliment
the
dark
fruit
and
caramel
malt
flavors
of
the
base
beer
cant
wait
to
try
this
beer
aged
overall
im
finding
this
to
be
relatively
tasty
and
definitely
unique
unless
im
mistaken
its
my
first
bourbon
barrel
aged
quad
nothing
earthshattering
but
absolutely
worth
checking
out
especially
if
youre
into
quads
just
dont
approach
it
thinking
rochefort
10
after
a
barrel
treatment
that
line
of
thought
will
only
set
you
up
to
be
disappointed
o
i
can
see
the
high
marks
for
this
wish
it
was
a
bit
less
hot
o
i
was
expecting
this
beer
to
be
a
lot
better
it
does
have
a
lot
of
great
qualities
and
a
few
average
qualities
i
still
find
it
to
be
very
tasty
and
enjoyable
pretty
solid
beer
cheers
overall
the
quad
was
one
of
the
best
i
have
ever
had
and
the
addition
of
the
bourbon
barrels
and
of
cherries
works
very
well
with
the
quad
style
this
is
one
of
the
most
unique
beer
and
i
enjoyed
and
it
very
much
opinion
overall
this
is
a
really
good
beer
i
am
very
happy
with
it
it
has
the
elements
of
the
most
world
class
beers
that
i
enjoy
so
much
but
i
know
that
they
are
just
artfully
blended
rather
than
fermentation
induced
which
is
again
testament
to
the
skill
of
the
brewers
at
boulevard
i
would
definitely
recommend
this
beer
i
will
probably
be
picking
a
couple
more
up
but
i
am
not
sure
how
well
they
will
age
since
they
are
already
showing
strong
signs
of
age
due
to
the
barrel
aging
if
you
like
quality
beer
this
one
is
such
and
i
would
recommend
it
o
the
bourbon
is
a
welcome
addition
to
the
quad
style
the
cherries
work
well
with
the
bourbon
to
make
this
a
unique
beer
o
well
balanced
and
interesting
the
bourbon
flavor
comes
through
to
me
very
clearly
glad
i
have
two
to
cellar
i
think
the
bourbon
flavor
will
blend
in
and
be
more
subtle
in
the
future
o
a
decent
drink
but
the
cherries
overpower
just
about
everything
bourbon
is
barely
present
might
not
be
noticeable
at
all
if
i
didnt
know
it
was
aged
in
the
barrel
would
like
to
try
this
beer
style
sans
cherries
thanks
again
thirstyherf
for
another
fantastic
beer
o
liked
this
beer
but
didnt
expect
the
sour
notes
at
all
bourbon
not
all
that
apparent
but
added
a
nice
flavor
to
it
might
have
to
pick
up
a
fresh
one
to
see
if
the
bourbon
stands
out
more
o
pushing
the
boundaries
on
the
quad
style
with
the
bourbon
flavors
but
very
tasty
need
to
search
out
some
more
bottles
and
see
what
effect
age
has
on
this
a
little
hot
right
now
but
definitely
delicious
find
it
and
love
it
had
this
one
on
christmas
eve
with
a
few
friends
the
beer
pours
a
reddish
color
with
a
good
sized
offwhite
head
the
smell
was
bourbon
some
notes
of
spice
fruit
and
a
little
sweetness
the
taste
follows
the
smell
with
a
big
bourbon
presence
less
sweetness
than
in
the
smell
dark
fruit
notes
and
a
litle
bit
of
spice
mouthfeel
was
a
little
lighter
than
expected
but
overall
an
amazing
beer
cant
wait
to
have
this
one
with
some
age
on
it
overall
delicious
plethora
of
flavors
with
warming
effect
makes
me
feel
at
home
little
sweet
dthe
bourbon
is
huge
in
this
one
and
the
cherries
are
also
very
stand
out
in
this
one
the
base
beer
is
a
little
hard
to
discern
but
its
tasty
nonetheless
this
really
was
not
what
i
was
expecting
the
bourbon
aroma
and
flavor
was
a
bit
light
and
was
replaced
by
a
cherry
tartness
d
this
was
a
nice
interesting
beer
but
it
seemed
more
like
a
flanders
brown
than
a
quad
or
maybe
like
a
shot
of
cheap
bourbon
tossed
in
some
average
quad
the
scent
and
taste
were
good
not
great
the
body
was
excellent
but
it
was
pretty
hot
so
it
must
be
sipped
enjoyable
to
try
but
not
recommended
o
a
nice
brew
a
bit
strong
but
nothing
one
man
couldnt
handle
recommended
pours
a
dark
dark
red
almost
a
brown
color
with
a
nice
tan
head
that
lingers
with
lacing
the
smell
is
complex
to
me
it
smells
like
the
bourbon
spices
but
with
none
of
the
alcohol
smell
as
i
taste
it
i
get
a
lot
of
the
bourbon
flavor
with
the
brief
alcohol
taste
a
nice
flavor
that
works
well
in
this
beer
there
is
said
to
be
a
cherry
flavor
in
this
beer
but
i
am
not
getting
that
unless
that
is
the
sweetness
i
pick
up
at
the
end
very
strongly
carbonated
almost
too
much
in
a
beer
like
this
overall
i
think
this
is
a
good
beer
but
i
will
take
my
quads
unbourbon
barrel
aged
from
now
on
overall
it
is
a
good
beer
but
that
bourbon
heat
is
the
showcase
it
should
be
a
little
more
mellow
and
let
the
other
flavors
come
out
to
play
o
a
good
quad
but
i
found
the
alcoholic
heat
to
be
fairly
distracting
ill
admit
this
is
the
latest
release
so
i
imagine
that
a
year
or
so
in
the
bottle
will
smooth
out
the
edges
however
at
this
point
while
all
the
flavors
are
present
its
also
a
bit
rough
add
still
drinking
it
and
its
getting
more
sour
really
not
what
i
was
expecting
and
i
am
starting
to
dislike
this
beer
more
and
more
the
taste
was
like
a
watered
down
anything
unibroue
with
a
lame
attempt
at
putting
cherries
in
it
somehow
the
cherry
taste
like
an
extract
unlike
lets
say
the
fantastic
new
glarus
cherry
tart
i
dont
see
the
point
of
spending
the
money
on
this
when
you
could
snag
a
three
philosophers
much
easier
that
is
a
quad
that
looks
tastes
and
feels
like
a
quad
with
cherry
boulevard
is
not
for
me
for
i
enjoy
flavor
instead
of
wet
socks
i
do
love
their
design
though
and
many
many
many
people
love
their
beers
sorry
guys
but
cheers
to
boulevard
for
brewing
anyways
o
we
are
pretty
sure
this
bottles
or
the
cask
is
infected
but
it
is
still
very
good
tasting
though
i
hope
i
can
try
one
more
in
the
future
but
then
without
the
infection
of
course
a
good
beer
though
i
was
a
bit
surprised
by
the
tart
cherry
presence
i
did
enjoy
it
though
i
have
no
real
desire
to
buy
any
more
in
the
future
definitely
the
most
impressive
boulevard
i
have
had
to
this
point
still
relatively
new
to
ma
quads
are
not
my
favorite
style
but
i
love
how
the
slight
bourbon
interacts
with
it
and
the
cherries
counter
the
spicy
yeast
profile
rather
well
o
i
havent
tried
this
before
and
i
am
glad
to
have
done
so
that
being
said
i
dont
think
i
will
buy
it
again
any
time
soon
i
like
the
smokestack
series
but
this
beer
does
not
compare
to
other
bb
belgian
styles
e
g
cuir
i
do
like
it
slightly
more
than
north
coasts
grand
cru
been
a
long
time
since
i
was
able
to
enjoy
a
bottle
of
this
stuff
it
pours
a
murky
brown
topped
by
a
bit
more
than
a
finger
of
tan
foam
the
nose
comprises
light
rye
bread
toffee
vanilla
bourbon
brown
sugar
and
a
tough
of
mild
cherry
way
in
the
background
the
taste
brings
in
more
of
the
same
along
with
some
oak
the
bread
is
stronger
now
and
the
cherries
come
through
as
a
sort
of
vague
tart
cherryness
pervading
the
general
backdrop
of
the
proceedings
yeah
that
makes
nothing
but
sense
right
the
body
is
a
strong
medium
with
a
very
light
moderate
carbonation
and
a
lightly
grainy
feel
overall
a
rather
enjoyable
brew
one
that
thankfully
doesnt
overdo
it
on
either
barrel
or
cherry
aspects
good
times
overall
great
beer
the
only
shortcoming
is
the
alcohol
which
may
fade
with
some
aging
cherries
and
bourbon
make
this
a
unique
quad
definitely
something
to
try
odthis
is
a
pretty
awesome
beer
at
8
50
for
the
750
ml
i
think
this
is
a
pretty
legit
deal
surprised
that
this
is
the
same
price
as
their
other
750
ml
beers
this
is
a
sipper
so
dont
rush
it
this
beer
changes
as
it
sits
in
the
glass
well
worth
a
try
favorite
boulevard
beer
by
far
o
a
superb
beer
the
sixth
glass
is
already
one
of
my
favorites
thanks
cory
but
this
takes
it
to
a
different
level
this
tastes
like
art
well
done
boulevard
i
am
so
glad
you
are
in
massachusetts
now
overall
this
brew
is
spectacular
as
all
the
flavors
are
integrated
so
nicely
bourbon
vanilla
and
cherry
combined
in
just
the
right
amounts
glorious
i
tell
ya
glorious
o
really
enjoyed
this
one
i
think
i
expected
it
to
really
blow
my
mind
since
it
has
my
3
favorite
things
in
a
beer
quad
cherries
and
bourbon
but
ill
have
to
revisit
it
to
see
if
i
feel
any
different
the
initial
taste
was
quite
warming
with
a
warming
citrus
vanilla
and
a
potent
cherry
the
bourbon
aging
became
more
apparent
as
the
flavors
washed
over
the
tongue
and
while
this
flavor
may
seems
complex
it
gave
a
hint
of
bitterness
as
it
crashed
into
the
back
of
the
tongue
while
quads
generally
have
a
lot
going
on
this
quad
seemingly
make
too
many
elements
dance
synchronization
drink
this
when
you
feel
like
sipping
some
cherry
infused
bourbon
liquor
and
you
will
be
happy
complex
interesting
and
really
good
overall
pours
a
hazy
amber
with
a
thin
amount
of
lingering
head
smells
of
cherries
and
a
decent
amount
of
booze
tastes
mostly
of
cherries
and
faint
hint
of
vanilla
mouthfeel
is
very
smooth
the
booziness
that
was
smelt
is
hardly
noticeable
on
the
palate
a
very
delicious
beer
wish
this
was
regularly
available
oamazing
beer
all
that
i
had
expected
but
as
for
being
a
year
old
i
feel
like
when
fresh
it
could
be
overly
tart
i
would
like
to
try
fresh
and
maybe
a
bit
older
could
have
more
bourbon
for
my
taste
but
over
all
amazing
a
nice
sweet
cherry
quad
though
there
are
better
examples
of
the
style
more
readily
available
that
being
said
i
was
really
excited
and
happy
i
got
the
opportunity
to
try
this
one
overall
a
good
beer
and
very
drinkable
for
the
alcohol
content
glad
i
have
a
couple
more
in
the
cellar
overall
i
had
high
hopes
for
this
beer
but
this
one
just
did
not
agree
with
my
palate
d
a
very
nice
offering
from
boulevard
ill
have
to
crack
my
own
batch
200801
bottle
to
see
how
the
additional
age
has
impacted
this
beer
i
can
certainly
recommend
a
semifresh
bottle
big
thanks
goes
out
to
aasher
for
this
one
as
i
have
been
wanting
to
try
it
for
quite
some
time
2010
vintage
served
from
bottle
into
a
mikkeller
taster
flute
poured
a
hazy
redorange
with
a
minimal
light
tan
head
maintained
decent
lacing
throughout
the
glass
the
aroma
was
comprised
of
sweet
malt
wood
cherry
caramel
and
toffee
the
flavor
was
of
sweet
malt
caramel
wood
subtle
tart
fruit
slight
metallic
toffee
and
cherry
it
had
a
medium
feel
on
the
palate
with
mild
carbonation
overall
this
was
a
pretty
good
brew
there
were
a
lot
of
complexities
that
i
would
not
have
expected
from
this
brew
going
on
this
made
it
quite
enjoyable
and
kept
me
guessing
on
each
sip
which
i
like
the
alcohol
on
this
one
was
definitely
covered
up
quite
well
definitely
worth
trying
if
you
have
not
done
so
already
shared
at
a
local
tasting
event
poured
into
snifter
glass
pours
a
murky
reddishbrown
color
with
a
good
thick
tan
head
that
fades
somewhat
quickly
to
a
thin
frothy
layer
theres
lots
of
bourbon
and
wood
in
the
aroma
along
with
the
cherries
belgian
yeast
and
candi
sugar
join
the
scent
as
well
but
are
not
as
noticeable
as
expected
the
flavor
adds
vanilla
dried
mixed
fruit
toffee
and
light
spice
that
go
along
with
the
cherries
and
bourbon
which
still
stand
out
here
the
wood
shows
mostly
in
the
finish
with
a
lot
of
wet
barrel
notes
surfacing
the
more
traditional
quad
flavors
are
diluted
belgian
yeast
dark
fruit
candi
sugar
they
are
here
but
rather
than
being
at
the
forefront
they
are
burried
beneath
the
strong
bourbon
and
cherry
this
shows
every
bit
of
11
8
with
a
rather
sharp
alcoholic
tang
that
just
seems
to
keep
getting
stronger
the
more
i
drink
this
medium
mouthfeel
and
decent
carbonation
throughout
overall
a
great
sipping
quad
overall
the
citrus
was
good
in
respect
to
mouthfeel
but
completely
overwhelmed
the
taste
and
aroma
not
nearly
as
complex
as
other
quads
kind
of
hard
to
get
past
the
tartness
it
has
a
tart
almost
bitter
aspect
and
not
the
same
creamy
quality
found
in
other
quads
like
rochforte
10
or
st
benardus
12
overall
the
flavors
all
played
in
great
harmony
but
i
couldnt
help
but
wonder
how
much
better
bbq
might
taste
if
given
a
few
years
to
mellow
if
i
have
the
chance
to
obtain
a
bottle
i
will
definitely
lay
it
down
for
35
years
please
give
it
a
try
if
you
have
the
opportunity
o
good
beer
one
of
the
most
complex
flavor
profiles
ive
ever
encountered
ranging
from
sour
to
bitter
to
sweet
all
in
each
sip
and
also
evolving
as
it
warmed
overall
this
beer
is
a
simple
conceit
executed
really
well
its
not
the
greatest
quad
in
the
world
but
if
youre
buying
something
called
bourbon
barrel
quad
you
probably
want
a
passable
quad
with
as
much
beautiful
flavor
extracted
from
bourbon
barrels
as
possible
throw
in
some
sour
cherries
and
thats
exactly
what
this
beer
is
o
good
quad
nice
balance
and
is
quite
enjoyable
have
had
it
multiple
times
now
at
tastings
but
always
look
forward
to
it
enjoy
it
o
the
beer
smells
great
but
pales
in
other
categories
especially
taste
which
is
a
terrible
place
to
have
the
weakest
link
unfortunately
bbq
wears
its
abv
on
its
sleeve
and
the
alcohol
approximates
the
rubbing
variety
this
was
an
extra
in
a
trade
thanks

a
bunch
of
large
bubbles

up
then
receding
to
a
collar
around
the
edges
nose
is
heavy

sour

a
light
and
sweet

comes
across
like
some
weird
american
sour

super
sharp

with
a
palate
of
butter
oak
sour
cherry
brett
i
dont
know
if
wild
yeast
was
actually
used
with
this
but
it
has
the
wet
sock
aspect
of
brett
alcohol
heat
and
some
caramel
type
malts
bring
up
the
back
i
have
to
say
this
is
completely
disgusting
just
way
too
much
of
everything
and
the
buttery
brett
like
elements
clash
horribly
with
the
base
beer
could
be
a
cigar
city
sour
probably
the
addition
of
the
bourbon
barrels
and
cherries
certainly
took
the
style
and
turned
it
on
its
head
a
much
different
layer
of
flavor
and
complexity
was
added
without
being
too
over
the
top
certainly
my
favorite
boulevard
beer
ive
had
although
its
not
been
many
overall
big
and
highly
drinkable
its
a
comfortable
and
pleasant
beer
highly
recommended
overall
this
was
a
letdown
for
me
maybe
it
is
too
young
but
i
cannot
forgive
a
beer
for
being
this
hot
after
a
year
plus
no
matter
what
i
am
not
a
fan
of
cherry
addition
beers
in
general
but
i
enjoyed
supplication
because
i
can
appreciate
a
good
wellmade
beer
but
this
is
a
miss
for
me
i
have
loved
all
the
boulevard
smokestack
beers
i
have
had
to
date
but
i
will
not
be
seeking
this
one
ever
again
i
cannot
say
this
very
often
but
i
wish
there
were
more
bourbon
flavors
in
this
beer
and
less
pure
alcohol
burn
i
will
give
boulevard
a
pass
here
because
all
the
rest
of
the
beers
i
have
sampled
from
them
have
been
top
quality
not
every
beer
can
be
a
winner
this
beer
has
a
mild
bourbon
aroma
the
flavor
is
a
bit
soapy
at
first
with
some
sweet
liquor
accents
that
are
very
mild
all
things
considered
with
the
abv
being
as
high
as
it
is
you
do
not
taste
the
alcohol
it
has
a
brown
colored
body
with
average
tan
head
and
lace
the
body
is
thick
with
some
sediment
the
mouthfeel
is
creamy
medium
body
that
leaves
you
with
a
warm
feeling
mouthfeeloverall
the
mouthfeel
is
quite
nice
a
medium
body
and
high
carbonation
leads
to
a
pretty
creamy
mouthfeel
overall
this
is
a
good
quad
but
the
majority
of
the
flavor
derives
from
the
barrel
treatment
i
dont
think
the
base
beer
would
hold
up
with
other
world
class
quads
still
i
enjoyed
it
and
am
glad
i
have
the
10
version
to
give
it
another
go
the
beer
flows
into
the
mouth
and
fills
it
first
with
a
quadlike
spice
the
spice
turns
into
an
oaky
vanilla
and
then
finally
fades
into
a
delicious
bourbon
sweetness
holding
everything
together
is
a
light
tartness
that
ties
everything
up
in
a
nice
little
package
the
beer
is
phenomenal
it
talks
to
me
on
so
many
levels
liquid
excellence
perfection
even
as
the
temp
goes
up
the
cherries
pop
awesomely
on
the
yeast
of
the
belgian
quad
with
a
tad
of
funk
being
2
years
old
the
amber
appearance
has
a
decent
off
white
head
the
flavors
of
liight
smoky
bourbon
and
quad
brew
with
some
decent
cherries
to
round
out
a
great
body
nice
orange
hazy
color
pretty
dark
and
murky
not
much
head
to
speak
of
but
this
is
an
ounce
to
a
2
ounce
pour
smells
extremely
tart
some
spices
in
there
does
not
smell
like
a
quad

across
the
board
a
damn
solid
beer
a
sipper
that
i
spent
two
hours
drinking
the
whole
bomber
tasty
overallnotes
well
boulevard
brewing
really
outdid
themselves
with
this
brew
easily
the
best
of
what
smokestack
brews
ive
had
and
ranks
right
up
there
with
the
best
quads
ive
ever
had
my
only
disappointment
was
that
i
did
not
manage
to
acquire
more
than
one
bottle
750ml
bottle
bottle
1930
of
11248
batch
2010i
pours
a
slightly
hazy
ruby
red
with
light
tan
head
active
carbonation
aroma
has
some
bourbon
cherries
other
pit
fruit
and
its
quite
bretty
this
smells
somewhat
like
consecration
taste
is
sweet
with
a
bit
of
sour
the
barreling
adds
some
depth
and
the
is
quite
a
bit
of
heat
developing
in
the
throat
and
chest
i
dont
imagine
that
the
sourness
is
intentional
but
its
not
bad
at
this
point
i
wish
it
were
more
sour
or
more
sweet
the
base
beer
at
this
time
doesnt
seem
to
add
much
to
this
beer
medium
bodied
with
a
slick
texture
smooth
but
hot
finish
again
i
dont
know
if
this
is
the
intended
beer
of
the
brewer
but
its
not
bad
at
all
as
a
quad
it
has
a
long
way
to
go
but
a
good
american
take
on
it
overall
this
may
be
my
first
dance
with
boulevard
bbq
but
it
definitely
wont
be
my
last
im
a
huge
fan
of
this
beer
and
its
one
i
plan
on
acquiring
more
of
in
the
future
very
unique
and
enjoyable
its
not
going
to
dethrone
a
good
trappist
but
its
a
very
welldone
americanized
take
on
the
style
from
beginning
to
end
this
is
finally
the
first
quad
to
really
win
my
heart
from
the
bigtime
winelike
flavors
to
the
seemless
integration
of
both
the
cherries
and
bourbon
influence
this
was
unique
highly
complex
and
incredibly
awesome
this
makes
me
really
sad
that
boulevard
pulled
out
of
tn
boulevard
flexes
its
beer
crafting
muscles
once
again
with
this
smoke
stack
series
stalwart
the
quad
is
dark
amber
no
head
huge
burbon
and
dark
cherry
on
the
nose
the
taste
is
definite
vanilla
and
sweetness
on
the
start
then
finishes
like
a
bourbon
this
is
a
sipping
beer
and
thus
mouthfeel
is
predicated
on
whether
to
session
or
not
if
a
sipping
the
mouthfeel
is
perfect
if
sessioning
you
will
rue
the
day
after
amber
color
very
cloudy
not
much
head
but
you
can
hear
the
bubbles
smells
of
bourbon
cherries
with
a
hint
a
vanilla
tastes
like
it
smells
but
in
reverse
order
of
the
way
it
smells
vanilla
is
subtle
cherries
are
perfectly
balanced
with
the
bourbon
very
smooth
full
mouth
feel
that
makes
this
a
nice
slow
sipper
ive
drank
5
bottles
total
and
i
have
3
more
in
the
cellar
to
see
if
it
gets
even
better
amazing
o
a
great
beer
but
this
really
doesnt
taste
to
style
we
had
a
long
debate
on
whether
this
was
infected
httpbeeradvocate
comforumread36439683644056
and
this
was
a
great
beer
but
it
just
didnt
fit
with
the
others
this
was
10
of
10
for
me
chewy
medium
body
with
sweet
chocolate
malt
dark
fruit
and
a
nice
barrel
presence
similar
to
the
aroma
the
bourbon
is
there
but
not
dominant
hints
of
toasted
oak
silky
vanilla
toasted
coconut
and
sweet
bourbon
without
being
hot
the
vanilla
flavor
really
smooths
things
out
underneath
there
is
a
nice
malt
backbone
with
hints
of
chocolate
and
caramel
and
plenty
f
peppery
spice
and
dark
fruit
notes
hints
of
raisiin
plum
fig
cherry
perfectly
balanced
with
an
incredibly
well
masked
abv
make
this
beer
dangerously
drinkable
probably
my
favorite
beer
in
the
smokestack
series
d
boulevards
sixth
glass
is
a
great
quad
but
the
barrel
aging
and
cherries
really
knock
this
one
out
of
the
park
would
definitely
go
out
of
my
way
to
drink
this
again
i
highly
recommend
that
other
quad
lovers
do
the
same
d
i
really
like
the
bbq
def
in
my
top
5
do
i
dont
know
how
but
this
reminded
me
a
lot
of
new
glarus
wisconsin
belgian
red
albeit
three
times
the
alcohol
a
true
delight
cork
was
a
bitch
to
get
out
well
worth
it
consider
this
guy
impressed
o
boulevard
bbq
is
one
of
those
beers
that
when
i
opened
it
and
decanted
i
couldnt
help
but
form
the
opinion
right
away
that
i
wouldnt
like
it
beer
is
downright
ugly
and
the
nose
is
nothing
that
id
expect
from
the
style
after
trying
though
i
know
better
this
beer
is
an
extremely
solid
creation
innovation
in
all
the
right
ways
this
beer
is
actually
better
than
most
traditional
quads
that
ive
had
feel
is
to
die
for
also
well
worth
seeking
out
we
all
enjoyed
this
beer
very
much
good
smell
with
the
oak
from
the
barrel
and
the
whiskey
taste
comes
out
really
well
good
colour
but
is
missed
the
carbonation
the
taste
has
a
good
amount
of
stone
fruit
notes
mainly
tart
cherry
with
some
sour
tropical
fruit
accents
and
highly
herbal
notes
that
verge
on
woody
in
taste
a
complex
flavor
with
light
bourbon
and
hints
of
golden
raisin
with
a
mild
amount
of
malt
sweetness
the
toasted
and
caramel
flavor
blends
well
with
the
light
fruit
in
the
yeast
an
interesting
array
of
fruit
and
flavors
from
the
barrel
and
contributed
by
the
yeast
makes
this
a
very
unique
and
engaging
beer
i
am
glad
i
got
to
try
this
the
unexpected
sour
tinge
really
brings
out
some
quad
qualities
you
dont
normally
get
thanks
to
capones
for
the
taste
outstanding
beer
as
an
occasional
treat
but
youd
better
share
this
large
bottle
with
some
friends
overall
a
very
unique
and
interesting
beer
you
will
be
hard
pressed
to
notice
that
this
is
a
belgian
style
beer
its
more
of
a
barrel
aged
sour
actually
kind
of
like
a
whiskeysour
mixed
drink
i
really
did
enjoy
it
though
huge
flavor
and
unlike
anything
else
out
there
kudos
to
boulevard
for
this
one
o
nice
but
not
a
quad
it
was
a
very
good
sipper
if
you
dont
like
bourbon
i
wouldnt
recommend
this
because
bourbon
is
a
cornerstone
flavor
in
this
fine
brew
the
mouthfeel
really
adds
to
success
of
this
beer
the
carbonation
is
a
little
high
for
the
style
but
helps
with
the
high
abv
the
tartness
is
complimentary
and
not
overpowering
break
this
out
on
a
special
occasion
a
celebratory
beer
wow
differant
then
what
i
expected
but
in
a
great
way
i
am
now
even
more
excited
for
chicago
to
get
boulevard
im
going
to
stock
up
on
this
one
very
nice
and
quite
well
crafted
one
of
the
better
domestic
quad
style
beers
i
can
recall
having
impressive
drinkability
good
overall
i
really
liked
this
beer
and
im
going
to
buy
a
couple
more
just
to
have
in
the
cellar
overall
it
didnt
seem
to
be
anything
like
it
was
supposed
to
be
but
actually
seemed
like
a
halfway
decent
american
wild
i
liked
the
cherry
and
bourbon
flavors
it
had
as
well
as
the
funky
sour
undertones
in
it
what
hurt
it
was
it
became
too
sweet
and
the
mouthfeel
was
just
off
for
either
style
not
a
good
quad
but
not
a
bad
american
wild
at
this
point
for
this
particular
bottle
had
i
held
it
to
a
quad
standard
my
rating
would
be
a
lot
lower
but
im
going
to
cut
it
some
slack
since
i
somewhat
liked
what
it
turned
into
finish
hoppy
malty
thing
going
on
here
caramel
grassy
after
flavor
of
a
dark
red
cherry
the
color
is
a
rich
reddish
brown
with
a
thin
beige
head
that
leaves
a
little
lacing
as
it
settles
the
smell
is
sweet
and
tart
mostly
sour
cherries
with
little
bourbon
or
malt
showing
through
the
taste
is
fantastic
a
perfectly
balanced
blend
of
malt
bourbon
sour
cherries
wood
and
spice
box
very
nice
and
unusually
sour
not
something
i
expected
from
a
quad
almost
like
an
american
sour
ale
but
more
balanced
we
paired
it
with
chili
with
the
spices
in
the
food
and
beer
complementing
each
other
bottle
6629
from
2009
vintage
pours
a
thick
cloudy
caramel
with
a
two
finger
head
and
thin
lacing
nose
plums
plastic
notes
light
cherrybrett
dusty
taste
hot
and
thin
with
an
unpleasant
sourness
to
it
really
little
depth
to
this
except
for
the
wood
and
malt
sweetness
finish
has
an
unpleasant
burn
and
abrasiveness
to
it
this
is
some
bad
hootch
i
did
find
this
to
be
similar
to
the
rr
consecration
just
more
subdued
and
balanced
d
this
beer
is
a
far
shy
from
the
sixth
glass
i
do
so
enjoy
the
barrels
and
cherries
overwhelm
this
beer
maybe
time
does
this
beer
justice
but
right
now
i
cant
handle
it
d
i
really
enjoyed
this
one
a
very
great
beer
i
might
have
to
hunt
one
of
these
ones
down
m
just
a
smidge
below
medium
bodied
bbq
is
a
pretty
murky
deep
brown
with
a
small
off
white
head
the
head
fades
away
quickly
but
can
be
resummoned
with
a
swirl
a
rather
unattractive
beer
complex
aroma
of
cherries
and
lightly
funky
wood
barrel
deep
belgian
aromatic
malt
and
light
bourbon
aroma
nice
quad
flavor
up
front
belgian
malt
mid
palate
i
get
some
musty
cherry
wood
and
just
a
hint
of
bourbon
this
beer
is
got
more
basement
then
expected
the
body
made
more
full
by
the
wood
and
cherry
not
the
most
quaffable
but
tasty
enjoy
this
with
a
good
friends
like
i
did
savor
it
d
the
night
of
our
tasting
here
was
our
lineup
celebration
ale
alesmith
speedway
fff
arctic
panzer
wolf
sexual
chocolate
and
bbq
on
this
particular
occasion
this
was
my
favorite
brew
of
the
night
dthis
stuff
is
the
balls
i
kind
of
wish
i
had
gotten
one
of
the
infected
bottles
i
keep
hearing
about
as
i
wouldve
liked
a
little
more
sourness
out
of
this
but
regardless
this
is
fantastic
stuff
i
want
more
d
one
and
done
high
abv
will
kick
your
butt
and
the
bourbon
feel
gets
overwhelming
after
a
bit
too
seems
like
thats
how
it
is
with
most
bourbon
barrel
aged
brews
for
me
though
but
nonetheless
this
is
one
outstanding
brew
i
love
boulevard
d
this
will
knock
you
on
your
ass
very
tasty
though
and
worth
the
price
of
admission
this
beer
poured
a
murky
apple
cider
color
topped
by
a
thin
white
head
this
beer
smells
of
dark
fruits
fig
some
earth
malty
sweetness
it
tastes
of
figsprunes
toffee
caramel
slight
booze
tart
almost
like
a
cider
medium
body
high
carbonation
very
spritzy
i
may
have
made
that
word
up
a
decent
beer
but
not
great
in
my
opinion
cheers
overall
this
beer
is
really
nice
i
think
some
age
might
bring
the
flavors
together
into
a
really
amazing
beer
however
i
think
that
this
beer
might
have
a
tad
to
much
hopsamerican
style
quad
this
is
gonna
be
amazing
in
a
year
or
two
d
i
liked
this
beer
a
lot
it
was
a
little
different
then
what
i
had
thought
but
it
worked
out
very
well
i
was
quite
surprised
by
the
abv
because
it
doesnt
drink
like
this
at
all
another
notch
in
the
smokestack
belt
for
boulevard
you
guys
really
knock
these
down
flavor
wise
fantastic
job
cant
believe
this
one
is
almost
12
only
getting
a
hint
of
alcohol
warmth
in
the
flavor
not
overly
sweet
and
so
wellbalanced
was
debating
whether
to
save
or
open
this
and
im
glad
i
tried
it
though
im
not
particularly
looking
forward
to
dropping
the
money
on
a
few
more
bottles
now
that
i
know
how
good
it
is
i
tried
chocolatecovered
cherries
and
black
forest
truffles
they
both
went
extremely
well
with
this
beer
bringing
the
more
subtle
cherry
notes
look
for
something
chocolatecherryish
but
not
too
sweet
and
you
have
yourself
a
winner
tastes
like
a
goddamn
motherfuck
shock
tarts
lightly
and
then
chocolately
barley
and
then
a
very
light
burn
of
whiskey
wood
but
then
in
the
back
all
inexplicable
you
got
hops
hops
hops
american
and
proud
wiping
themselves
like
windswept
hay
against
the
burny
weedy
wood
almost
heavy
in
mouthfeel
but
very
pleasant
coats
the
palate
definitely
a
sipping
beer
but
more
drinkable
than
i
initially
thought
its
gone
before
i
know
it
and
i
keeping
needing
to
pour
more
this
is
now
easily
in
my
top
5
very
nice
but
almost
like
a
flemish
red
black
cherry
alcohol
bourbon
funky
barnyardy
earthy
flavors
vanilla
date
fig
plum
raisin
sweet
finish
with
moderate
complexity
nice
but
not
what
i
was
expecting
when
i
opened
this
beer
i
thought
they
had
bottled
a
flemish
red
into
a
bottle
that
said
quad
was
not
what
i
was
expecting
what
so
ever
overall
a
really
nice
surprise
i
knew
the
beer
had
gotten
good
reviews
but
ive
never
been
a
really
big
fan
of
bourbon
this
one
proves
that
it
can
be
done
well
and
the
results
are
excellent
d
slow
drinker
good
sipper
just
like
a
good
bourbon
good
beer
to
share
with
friends
d
this
is
great
looked
forward
to
it
and
wasnt
disapointed
would
buy
again
overall
this
was
very
nice
i
have
heard
a
few
complain
about
the
pricetag
which
i
can
see
because
i
remember
being
skeptical
when
i
set
up
a
trade
for
this
with
more
than
a
few
great
beers
that
oz
per
oz
heavily
outweighed
this
beer
that
said
this
is
aged
in
bourbon
barrels
a
slightly
more
to
produce
but
not
20
a
bottle
if
i
remember
correctly
maybe
it
was
a
bum
bottle
the
tart
characters
definitely
didnt
seem
right
shared
the
bottle
and
we
both
ended
up
pouring
some
out
in
the
end
verdict
bbq
is
a
thoroughly
unique
and
enjoyable
brew
that
delivers
on
both
its
premise
and
its
promise
its
big
and
complex
but
manages
to
blend
the
various
different
flavors
in
a
way
that
isnt
overwhelming
without
a
doubt
this
is
the
greatest
cherrylaced
and
woodaged
american
quadrupel
on
the
market
today
this
is
a
damn
nice
quad
once
you
get
past
the
initial
shock
of
bourbon
its
hefty
yet
once
you
settle
into
the
overall
experience
you
can
truly
feel
the
waves
of
taste
roll
through
your
mouth
between
the
bourbon
the
solid
quad
followed
by
a
nice
hint
of
cherries
sadly
ive
already
finished
my
4
bottles
and
cant
find
it
anywhere
else
but
if
you
can
find
it
grab
more
than
one
so
you
can
take
a
few
shots
at
getting
to
the
heart
of
it
it
definitely
matures
as
it
cools
down
so
let
it
sit
after
removing
from
the
fridge
for
a
few
minutes
drinkability
umm
this
one
just
disappeared
from
my
glass
honestly
for
the
price
this
is
an
incredible
drink
bourbon
is
by
far
my
favorite
liquor
and
because
of
this
i
have
tried
as
many
bourbon
barrelaged
beers
as
i
can
find
and
afford
of
those
bbq
is
currently
my
1
i
really
enjoyed
tasting
the
difference
between
2009
and
2010s
vintages
and
hope
to
have
an
opportunity
to
sample
2011s
ive
heard
great
things
about
this
beer
but
that
wasnt
my
experience
with
it
it
was
passable
enough
but
nothing
worth
writing
home
about
cheers
side
note
i
forgot
who
sent
this
to
me
i
appreciate
it
but
sorry
i
forget
who
it
was
d
this
beer
is
delicious
i
can
see
why
its
so
highly
regarded
its
delicious
and
has
quad
style
qualities
but
its
experimental
and
it
doesnt
blow
up
in
blvds
face
awesome
high
abv
though
this
beer
is
dangerous
at
12
abv
you
can
be
on
the
floor
after
one
bottle
by
yourself
luckily
i
had
a
friend
it
pours
a
very
hazy
dark
amber
color
with
virtually
no
head
the
smell
is
fruity
with
an
obvious
hint
of
banana
malt
and
bourbon
go
figure
the
taste
is
very
sweet
with
hints
of
banana
spice
and
bourbon
at
the
end
even
though
the
beer
has
such
a
high
abv
it
does
not
taste
overly
strong
of
alcohol
the
mouthfeel
is
very
silky
with
no
aftertaste
let
it
age
a
bit
for
it
to
get
better
i
had
intended
to
share
this
with
my
father
who
prays
at
the
bmc
altar
but
as
i
suspected
it
was
a
bit
much
for
him
he
said
that
doesnt
even
taste
like
a
beer
and
hes
right
it
does
not
taste
like
a
bmc
beer
i
offered
a
taste
to
my
mother
who
is
really
a
wine
drinker
and
she
totally
dug
it
but
just
a
small
glass
was
enough
i
could
have
easily
drank
the
whole
thing
myself
the
2
5
glasses
i
had
were
enough
for
the
evening
even
though
this
beer
is
huge
i
find
it
delightful
and
was
more
than
happy
to
consume
over
two
thirds
of
it
myself
i
got
another
bottle
in
waiting
wonder
how
long
i
can
last
honestly
when
i
first
tasted
this
i
thought
it
had
an
infection
problem
and
since
i
was
apparently
the
first
person
to
tell
odell
about
their
bourbon
infection
i
thought
i
was
cursed
but
as
i
drink
on
i
find
that
this
is
a
wonderfully
amazing
beer
no
beer
has
ever
changed
impression
so
much
through
the
course
of
a
single
bottle
for
me
definitely
gets
better
as
it
warms
honestly
this
beer
isnt
all
that
drinkable
at
all
its
definitely
a
beer
for
sipping
i
would
have
rather
split
the
750
ml
with
another
person
but
i
didnt
know
anyone
that
was
interested
so
its
up
to
me
to
polish
it
off
on
this
new
years
eve
almost
30
minutes
into
it
and
im
not
even
half
way
through
it
great
tasting
beer
but
very
daunting
finally
tried
my
hand
at
the
bbq
over
xmas
and
have
to
say
i
was
taken
back
the
brew
had
me
take
a
step
and
reevaluate
it
many
times
as
the
flavors
are
very
complex
usually
there
are
more
defined
layers
of
flavor
in
brews
this
particualr
brew
i
felt
the
flavors
were
all
fighting
for
dominance
of
the
beer
then
i
continued
to
sip
on
it
letting
warm
gradually
threw
out
the
drink
the
flavors
begain
to
exchange
roles
in
this
particular
brew
the
bourbon
quad
flavor
and
oak
were
exchanging
places
back
and
forth
it
was
a
very
interesting
brew
and
i
am
glad
that
i
purchased
it
i
feel
like
this
is
a
must
try
even
if
it
is
not
your
style
overall
the
drinkability
on
this
is
incredible
its
super
smooth
and
a
wonderful
sipper
it
gives
little
to
no
hint
that
its
anywhere
near
11
8
just
what
i
wanted
on
christmas
night
d
great
mouthfeel
dry
and
clean
yet
fullflavored
and
quite
tasty
a
little
bit
refreshing
even
for
such
a
big
beer
overall
im
indecisive
the
smell
taste
at
first
seem
good
but
theres
a
tang
to
it
that
just
doesnt
seem
right
or
im
crazy
first
off
i
do
not
like
that
boulevard
puts
best
by
dates
on
all
of
their
beers
even
the
beers
they
make
that
are
worth
aging
this
bottle
says
it
is
no
3459
out
of
11248
this
beer
looks
intriguing
it
is
a
dark
brown
with
burnt
red
accents
it
poured
smoothly
and
medium
in
body
with
a
two
finger
light
khaki
head
the
aromas
come
in
waves
it
first
hits
you
with
a
cherry
sweetness
before
going
tart
it
then
finishes
with
a
nice
smooth
bourbon
finish
the
flavor
too
has
different
phases
it
begins
with
excellent
sharp
cherry
tartness
before
heading
into
the
bourbon
and
then
finishing
sweet
it
drinks
very
smoothly
and
is
soft
on
the
palate
im
a
little
surprised
since
this
beer
is
so
fresh
the
only
reason
i
dont
give
it
a
five
on
drinkability
is
the
alcohol
content
it
wouldnt
be
as
noticeable
if
not
for
the
bourbon
excellent
top
notch
beer
i
love
this
one
it
lived
up
to
its
billing
and
then
some
complex
and
warming
a
perfect
winter
release
750ml
corked
caged
no
0025
of
11248
something
tells
me
thats
just
what
they
print
on
every
bottle
opaque
orange
brown
with
a
thin
head
with
nice
creamy
lacing
smells
like
sherry
wood
cherries
and
peppery
phenols
tastes
peppery
sweet
very
woody
has
a
bandaid
like
quality
but
i
say
that
with
love
and
affection
mouthfeel
is
sticky
and
pleasantly
carbonated
drinkability
is
good
there
is
a
warming
alcohol
finish
that
warns
you
to
stay
on
your
toes
a
very
good
outing
from
boulevard
it
is
a
sweet
interesting
take
on
the
style
and
one
ill
take
more
of
next
time
this
ale
is
great
but
it
needs
to
age
and
mellow
out
the
alcohol
is
overpowering
which
i
feel
would
be
smoother
after
sitting
on
the
shelf
a
year
or
two
my
problem
is
that
i
couldnt
leave
it
sit
for
that
long
d
scary
easy
for
the
abv
really
exciting
for
the
palate
and
by
far
the
best
beer
i
have
had
from
boulevard
brewing
d
this
is
a
very
good
very
complex
beer
that
gets
better
as
it
warms
it
has
awesome
balance
with
the
sour
cherries
and
bourbon
but
keeping
the
dark
fruitiness
of
a
quad
present
awesome
beer
i
highly
recommend
to
anyone
who
loves
fine
craft
beers
especially
quadrupels
or
barrel
aged
beers
poured
into
a
westmalle
chalice
ruby
red
with
a
half
finger
white
head
that
actually
sticks
around
for
a
while
the
scent
is
almost
like
a
wine
scent
beacuse
of
the
graperaisins
scent
from
the
quad
with
bourbon
and
wood
from
the
barrels
theres
also
some
hints
of
vanilla
in
the
nose
the
cherries
are
very
noticeable
at
first
then
the
quad
comes
out
with
raisins
then
the
mouth
is
warmed
by
the
vanilla
and
bourbon
wood
the
body
is
light
however
the
carbonation
is
high
the
alcohol
is
noticable
but
not
over
powering
drink
very
glad
i
got
one
of
these
to
try
once
ill
want
the
2nd
batch
but
1
was
alright
by
me
its
a
nice
big
beer
on
a
cold
day
definitely
recomended
if
you
can
still
find
it
wish
id
bought
two
d
what
can
i
say
about
a
beer
that
is
one
of
my
favorite
styles
from
one
of
my
favortie
breweries
this
review
is
on
bottle
that
is
about
a
year
old
i
think
time
has
done
it
well
brand
new
bbq
seems
to
have
a
bit
of
an
alcohol
punch
that
has
diminished
after
a
year
although
i
think
some
of
the
bourbon
flavors
have
mellowed
with
time
which
is
a
bad
thing
imo
this
is
a
very
drinkable
for
11
8
abv
this
is
a
complex
and
now
very
smooth
beer
great
cold
winter
night
beer
not
exactly
an
exact
replica
of
a
belgian
quad
but
it
is
unique
and
very
good
d
ridiculously
drinkable
for
what
it
is
and
an
all
around
pretty
excellent
beer
drinkability
moderate
at
best
the
abv
is
a
real
buttkicker
in
this
one
and
its
definitely
hot
if
i
manage
to
land
another
bottle
of
this
offering
it
will
sit
for
a
minimum
of
2
years
before
i
even
consider
cracking
it
bottle
bottle

poured
into
a
tulip
glass
pours
a
murky
rust
colored
red
color
with
a
nice
fluffy
off
white
head
nice
soft
cherry
aroma
in
the
nose
i
also
get
an
alcohol
bite
in
be
nose
mixed
with
the
bourbon
age
barrel
sweet
cheery
dominates
the
taste
along
with
oak
bourbon
vanilla
and
dark
fruit
some
alcohol
present
in
he
taste
though
medium
mouthfeel
alcohol
definitely
leaves
a
warming
sensation
in
the
mouth
the
beer
is
pretty
big
and
robust
but
doesnt
give
off
a
lot
of
heat
imo
quite
a
nice
mix
of
bourbon
and
quad
i
wish
i
had
another
of
these
tasty
treats
floating
around
dry
on
the
finish
it
has
a
full
and
ample
mouthfeel
with
a
very
appropriate
level
of
carbonation
for
the
style
unlike
many
american
quads
i
have
tried
this
one
does
not
have
that
almost
cloyinglysweet
finish
really
happy
that
i
got
to
try
this
one
as
it
definitely
met
and
exceeded
expectations
d
the
higher
abv
is
the
only
thing
that
could
stop
me
from
drinking
this
bottle
and
i
intend
to
finish
the
whole
thing
outstanding
d
this
is
the
first
of
the
smokestack
series
that
i
had
back
in
2008
now
in
2010
im
just
as
impressed
by
it
as
i
was
then
boulevard
hit
the
mark
on
this
one
and
of
all
their
beers
this
is
one
that
i
will
continually
seek
out
over
and
over
very
highly
recommended
this
is
a
medium
to
full
bodied
brew
with
a
light
level
of
carbonation
super
drinkable
and
the
alcohol
is
masterfully
hidden
at
first
i
am
uncertain
whether
or
not
the
bretty
sour
incorporation
is
intended
but
i
like
what
it
did
to
this
brew
drinkability
is
fairly
good
some
warming
and
tingly
booze
but
drinks
well
for
almost
12
a
little
sticky
as
well
but
for
what
it
is
it
drinks
very
smoothly
the
lack
of
carbonation
really
huts
this
beer
what
could
have
been
an
easy
a
to
a
as
this
beer
had
a
great
nose
and
was
delicious
pours
a
darker
shade
of
amber
brown
with
a
slight
off
white
to
tan
head
some
spotty
lacing
nose
brings
a
hefty
dose
of
bourbon
along
with
some
nice
vanilla
oak
dark
fruit
spicy
yeast
and
a
bit
of
brown
sugar
taste
is
mostly
bourbon
along
with
some
nice
sweet
malt
and
some
belgian
characteristics
slight
amounts
of
bourbonbased
booze
and
a
nice
creaminess
to
it
drinks
really
well
quite
unique
and
very
enjoyable
actually
worse
than
their
regular
quad
overall
as
crazy
as
that
is
considering
that
usually
bals
awesomeness
i
poured
this
into
my
goblet
and
was
immediately
intrigued
bbq
has
a
deep
red
to
brown
foamy
head
that
remains
throughout
the
entire
glass
when
held
to
light
it
reveals
a
beautiful
ruby
haze
smell
is
a
combination
of
tart
fruit
and
alcohol
taste
is
what
sets
this
apart
i
know
its
not
your
typical
quad
but
with
a
taste
of
tart
fruit
and
yeast
with
a
slight
bourbon
hint
i
dont
think
i
really
want
a
by
the
book
quad
mouthfeel
is
smooth
when
it
first
hits
the
palate
then
sharp
when
the
alcohol
hits
i
looked
forward
to
each
and
every
sip
drinkability
is
high
due
to
the
flavor
but
with
and
11
8
abv
better
make
sure
someone
else
is
driving
boulevard
hit
the
nail
on
the
head
with
bbq
i
firmly
believe
that
before
long
boulevard
will
be
greatly
sought
after
this
brewery
will
make
a
hell
of
a
name
for
itself
bravo
zulu
boulevard
on
a
job
well
done
spoton
for
a
quad
with
some
lovely
extras
a
beer
of
the
ages
with
every
sip
we
heard
an
angel
cry
d
delicious
end
to
a
great
day
of
beer
m
at
first
the
carbonation
is
too
high
as
the
beer
breathes
it
gets
better
but
its
still
a
bit
much
the
beer
is
quite
dry
seeing
this
one
on
the
shelf
got
me
excited
i
had
heard
about
this
one
and
was
very
excited
to
try
it
poured
a
someone
murky
brown
color
with
a
little
bit
of
offwhite
head
good
aromas
of
brown
sugar
bourbon
and
cherries
on
the
palate
i
got
more
of
the
same
plus
tart
apple
oak
and
vanilla
not
as
great
as
id
hoped
but
still
very
good
shocking
that
this
is
a
12
barrel
aged
quad
this
beer
is
amazingly
refreshing
and
drinkable
really
shocking
at
how
smoothly
this
beer
goes
down
another
excellent
boulevard
smokestack
series
beer
d
goes
down
with
a
bit
of
easy
definite
kick
nice
representation
of
style
there
is
a
bit
of
heat
in
the
initial
taste
but
it
isnt
too
overpowering
not
one
to
sit
with
for
the
evening
but
definitely
a
nice
after
dinner
beer
terrific
on
its
own
but
would
pair
even
better
with
good
barbecue
or
a
decent
cigar
md
smooth
and
easy
to
drink
superbly
blended
and
balanced
an
expert
example
of
the
smokestack
series
well
done
boulevard
very
easy
to
drink
for
the
12
abv
but
not
something
i
could
just
sit
back
and
drink
everyday
all
day
the
beer
pours
a
rich
dark
amber
and
a
2
5
finger
caramel
cap
on
a
beer
of
this
strength
in
a
glass
thats
not
usually
friendly
for
head
formation
is
damn
impressive
i
was
hoping
for
a
little
bit
of
lacing
and
bbq
didnt
really
deliver
just
keeping
it
from
earning
a
5
for
looks
smell
is
of
a
typical
quad
along
with
a
heavy
bourbon
barrel
aroma
but
the
cherries
are
imperceptible
the
nose
has
me
a
little
worried
im
hoping
this
isnt
an
overly
boozy
mess
like
some
barrel
aged
beers
can
become
the
first
sip
makes
me
feel
terrible
for
being
a
non
believer
this
beer
tastes
incredible
the
expected
dark
fruit
quad
flavor
is
upfront
along
with
some
vanilla
from
the
barrels
oak
and
a
subtly
tart
cherry
flavor
do
battle
for
attention
in
the
background
theres
also
a
slight
warming
alcohol
sensation
but
its
not
harsh
and
melds
in
well
with
the
other
flavors
the
only
thing
keeping
this
beer
from
being
world
class
is
the
mouthfeel
the
body
is
a
little
thin
for
such
a
big
beer
it
could
stand
to
be
more
rich
and
the
carbonation
is
just
a
tad
too
fizzy
despite
that
the
great
flavor
and
seamless
integration
of
alcohol
make
this
eminently
quaffable
this
is
my
first
beer
from
boulevard
consider
me
extremely
impressed
bourbon
barrel
quad
is
yet
another
outstanding
smokestack
series
ale
from
the
talented
folks
at
boulevard
hey
guys
if
youre
listening
please
bring
back
a
few
of
your
greatest
hits
like
imperial
stout
and
bbq
as
regular
releases
if
possible
overall
i
enjoyed
this
beer
but
i
would
like
to
see
it
without
the
addition
of
cherries
the
fruit
aromas
and
flavors
from
the
yeast
dont
really
have
a
chance
to
shine
because
the
cherry
flavors
take
over
still
its
a
very
good
beer
and
well
worth
a
shot
boulevard
whipped
up
a
dandy
in
bourbon
barrel
quad
this
is
one
of
the
finer
moments
of
the
smokestack
series
truth
be
told
i
recall
enjoying
every
one
of
beers
ive
tried
from
the
series
i
cant
complain
about
much
here
perhaps
the
nose
would
benefit
from
a
belgian
yeast
presence
thats
about
it
ive
thoroughly
enjoyed
this
one
highly
recommended
mouthfeel
is
light
and
airy
but
solid
hard
to
explain
but
its
pleasant
and
surprising
for
this
style
and
this
strength
not
too
sweet
not
too
sour
not
too
bitter
nice
mouthfeel
nice
drinkable
beer

d
seems
like
i
want
to
keep
the
bourbon
out
of
my
belgians
in
stouts
and
barleywines
it
works
great
hell
even
my
boubon
weizenbock
is
good
but
the
beauty
of
a
quad
is
the
great
things
the
yeast
does
the
yeast
cant
shine
in
a
hostile
bourbon
environment
d
not
a
daily
drinker
but
good
to
the
palate
and
especially
good
matched
with
a
rare
piece
of
grilled
beef
d
this
one
is
a
sipper
to
be
sure
but
it
gets
even
more
complex
as
it
warms
even
at
room
temperature
it
goes
down
nicely
a
fantastic
quad
right
here
bbq
is
highly
recommended
d
an
interesting
variation
on
the
style
with
bourbon
aging
and
cherries
sweet
and
rich
but
fitting
for
the
style
i
enjoyed
this
one
but
i
feel
like
some
of
the
initial
quad
characteristics
are
hidden
due
to
the
barrel
aging
still
a
solid
beer
in
a
style
that
i
love
d
awesome
stuff
bbq1
i
hope
bbq2
is
as
good
d
an
interesting
beer
that
i
was
glad
to
try
but
was
slightly
disappointed
in
i
didnt
think
there
was
much
bourbon
in
the
smell
but
enjoyed
it
in
the
taste
would
give
another
shot
edit
upon
letting
this
warm
up
i
am
greatly
reminded
of
a
dr
pepper
or
cherry
cola
even
more
impressively
delicious
this
is
a
beer
that
grew
on
me
as
it
warmed
and
i
warmed
to
it
decent
beer
not
great
but
decent
d
perhaps
my
favoite
boulevard
beer
ive
had
thus
far
i
found
the
bourbon
presence
to
be
pretty
spoton
here
giving
the
flavor
a
nice
balance
of
sweet
woody
and
alcohol
notes
this
is
a
big
complex
beer
and
a
very
good
one
at
that
worth
seeking
out
d
well
its
unfortunate
that
there
was
no
smokestack
series
while
i
lived
in
mo
because
i
drank
my
fair
share
of
boulevard
products
it
seems
that
boulevard
has
reinvented
themselves
a
bit
and
have
shown
that
they
have
the
ability
to
make
some
complex
big
beers
with
the
best
of
them
the
08
is
truely
an
amazing
quad
with
a
completely
original
twist
i
wish
i
could
say
the
same
about
the
09
bbq
but
the
carbonation
and
flavor
integration
just
isnt
there
d
sweet
but
not
cloyingly
so
the
bourbon
really
adds
a
nice
something
extra
to
the
quad
the
abv
isnt
even
noticeable
i
am
glad
i
was
able
to
try
this
looking
forward
to
other
beers
from
the
smokestack
series
overall
well
balanced
for
what
it
is
i
would
have
thought
this
would
be
a
beer
that
would
hit
you
over
the
head
with
all
sorts
of
complexities
it
was
actually
straight
forward
and
mellow
nice
example
of
the
style
hazy
amber
brown
color
with
a
large
khaki
colored
head
that
fell
slowly
light
lacing
on
the
tulip
good
retention
aroma
has
typical
quad
characteristics
yeasty
bready
some
underlying
booze
but
with
a
nice
addition
of
subtle
cherries
and
maybe
just
a
hint
of
barrel
qualities
not
getting
much
in
the
way
of
bourbon
however
great
flavor
on
this
one
cherries
are
much
more
prominent
than
the
nose
would
suggest
and
theyre
somewhat
sweet
but
not
tart
this
character
blends
nicely
with
the
malty
bready
deliciousness
of
the
base
quad
some
light
bourbon
flavors
start
to
come
out
as
it
warms
up
which
gives
this
a
nice
complexity
full
bodied
carbonation
is
actually
lighter
than
what
i
was
expecting
good
beer
here
and
pretty
drinkable
despite
the
high
abv
dig
it
drinkability
first
batch
was
amazing
subsequent
batches
have
not
been
so
good
i
have
lowered
my
score
from
4
83
as
a
result
i
think
this
beer
may
have
continued
developing
im
not
getting
much
wood
or
bourbon
i
am
getting
some
acetic
based
sourness
pediococcos
kind
of
activity
in
there
beer
is
medium
bodied
but
not
at
all
what
i
expected
pours
a
clear
reddish
brown
with
a
huge
tan
head
smells
very
strongly
of
sour
cherries
vanilla
and
scotch
whisky
taste
is
sweet
oak
vanilla
and
cherries
up
front
which
fades
to
a
slightly
tart
and
sour
cherry
middle
and
a
earthy
malty
finish
quite
a
bit
of
alcohol
burn
at
the
end
mouthfeel
is
very
rich
slightly
high
carbonation
drinkability
is
average
this
beer
is
extremely
boozy
and
really
a
56oz
serving
is
ideal
imo
i
like
the
flavor
but
it
does
get
overpowering
fast
best
to
be
split
amongst
several
people
imo
i
would
get
this
again
however
d
not
my
favorite
beer
from
boulevard
but
some
good
flavors
i
am
curious
to
see
how
the
other
bottle
i
have
matures
as
i
think
there
is
a
good
beer
here
just
not
exactly
what
i
like
in
this
case
the
body
is
big
with
a
sweet
finish
would
like
to
see
a
quad
a
bit
drier
i
think
that
this
is
also
what
makes
it
tastefeel
like
a
barleywine
some
heat
from
the
beer
but
not
over
the
top
carbonation
is
light
to
none
overall
a
very
tasty
beer
drinkability
isnt
bad
but
this
is
the
one
area
where
this
doesnt
stand
with
the
best
quads
the
booziness
the
high
heat
and
the
mouthfeel
all
fall
short
of
the
benchmarks
of
the
style
delicious
but
huge
one
to
be
drunk
almost
like
a
nice
whiskey
rather
than
a
beer
d
as
always
with
me
i
like
the
bourbon
barrel
aged
beers
but
cant
really
drink
many
and
a
tad
hard
to
get
thru
them
i
split
a
25
ounce
bottle
amongst
friends
pouring
inot
smalll
tumblers
it
pours
a
caramel
red
with
an
abundant
white
head
bits
of
lacing
scattered
on
the
glass
bourbon
soaked
fruit
ruled
the
nose
along
with
oak
and
vanilla
up
front
a
subtle
amount
of
bourbon
with
date
and
plum
notes
the
oak
in
this
is
real
strong
flavor
thoughout
bbq
is
medium
in
body
with
high
carbonation
and
sticky
mouth
feel
thanks
to
dunt
for
this
bottle
dthis
is
extremely
delicious
and
the
way
they
aged
it
to
put
in
a
great
amount
of
oaky
vanilla
and
light
notes
of
bourbon
i
love
when
the
bourbon
is
there
but
just
as
a
role
player
rather
than
a
centerpiece
of
the
offense
the
cherries
are
great
and
some
other
light
dark
fruits
come
in
to
play
as
well
fantastic
smoothness
and
complexity
awesome
beer
d
a
25
oz
bottle
may
be
a
bit
much
for
one
but
if
consumed
over
a
couple
of
hours
its
not
that
overwhelming
a
great
brew
i
dont
think
i
have
had
one
i
didnt
like
from
these
guys
i
will
try
to
get
another
of
these
soon
this
brew
was
the
highlight
of
a
small
sampling
of
some
awesome
beers
so
i
say
go
for
it
if
you
can
get
it
dyou
best
enjoy
bourbon
to
like
this
one
good
thing
i
do
a
very
well
crafted
and
totally
enjoyable
creation
d
this
a
very
complex
and
interesting
beer
but
the
bourbon
profile
is
a
little
too
powerful
to
promote
any
long
lasting
drinking
with
this
beer
that
being
said
i
fully
attend
on
finishing
this
bottle
i
could
go
into
details
about
the
the
mouthfeel
finish
and
all
that
but
being
that
i
just
finished
the
750ml
bottle
of
this
youll
understand
this
is
an
absolutely
excellent
beer
by
all
means
try
it
if
you
get
the
chance
this
is
the
first
bourbon
barrel
beer
that
tasted
almost
exactly
like
whiskey
its
an
interesting
mix
of
liquor
and
carbonation
i
have
to
say
im
no
fan
of
whiskey
but
this
beer
i
can
actually
tolerate
its
light
liquor
aroma
and
heavymedium
flavor
make
for
an
entertaining
beverage
md
the
only
thing
i
will
mark
this
beer
down
on
is
the
mouthfeel
which
could
be
slightly
more
robust
otherwise
a
perfect
beer
i
loved
this
one
all
the
way
easily
one
of
the
top
quads
ive
ever
had
batch
number
20082
was
last
bottle
at
nates
liqour
was
in
cooler
but
has
sat
at
room
temp
for
almost
a
week
now
just
waiting
for
the
right
time
smells
of
carmel
drift
from
the
open
bottle
along
with
a
heavy
sent
that
i
cant
put
a
name
to
almost
a
dill
pickle
tartness
of
cherry
poured
into
my
wide
mouth
goblet
and
had
nice
one
finger
light
tan
head
that
has
receded
to
a
one
quarter
inch
now
noticing
good
carbonation
for
such
a
strong
beer
slight
whiskey
leather
and
cherry
aroma
taste
is
cherries
up
front
followed
by
belgian
yeast
with
a
bit
of
a
funk
alcohol
is
hidden
very
well
and
this
is
one
that
i
will
soon
repeat
not
nearly
as
hot
as
i
thought
it
would
taste
but
very
good
bottle
poured
a
deep
copper
color
ale
with
a
great
big
foamy
head
with
good
retention
and
some
lacing
aroma
of
caramel
and
light
toffee
malt
with
some
light
dry
fruits
notes
and
some
even
more
subtle
notes
of
vanilla
taste
is
also
a
nice
mix
between
some
caramel
malt
with
balanced
sweetness
and
some
dry
figs
with
a
well
rounded
finish
with
a
hint
of
vanilla
from
the
bourbon
barrelaging
is
not
as
dominant
as
expected
but
bring
a
well
rounded
finish
to
this
beer
body
is
above
average
with
good
carbonation
and
no
apparent
alcohol
very
well
done
though
a
not
a
quad
as
per
the
precise
style
guideline
but
then
who
cares
d
the
combination
of
flavors
here
is
extremely
unique
and
i
like
it
certain
flavors
come
on
a
bit
too
strong
at
times
namely
that
caramelbrown
sugar
sweetness
but
its
still
very
balanced
which
is
a
surprising
feat
for
such
a
unique
flavor
profile
the
heat
is
kept
very
well
in
check
too
the
body
is
pretty
darn
heavy
though
all
in
all
a
great
sipper
though
in
most
situations
one
to
be
shared
d
once
again
the
smokestack
series
does
not
disappoint
a
nice
take
on
the
style
good
experimentation
surprisingly
drinkable
for
11
8
recommended
overall
this
is
certainly
a
unique
twist
on
the
style
and
a
wellcrafted
beer
fans
of
both
sours
and
quads
should
be
pleased
thanks
again
chuck
for
sending
this
brew
my
way
recommended
got
this
as
a
nice
christmas
gift
from
a
kansas
city
friend
finally
got
around
to
opening
it
up
this
past
friday
always
a
fan
of
boulevard
stuff
and
this
one
surprised
me
at
first
the
first
taster
i
struggled
with
the
alcohol
was
just
too
much
overtaking
the
cherries
fruits
or
anything
to
that
nature
however
i
think
i
just
needed
it
to
breathe
the
rest
was
very
enjoyable
especially
wiht
some
creamy
chocolate
worth
a
try
not
as
heavy
as
other
quads
medium
mouthfeel
medium
carbonation
very
good
taste
bourbon
stands
out
especially
the
warming
factor
cherries
overtake
any
other
fruit
notes
but
slight
raisindates
belgian
yeast
this
is
truly
a
great
beer
somewhat
hot
with
booze
but
who
cares
this
is
wonderful
there
is
a
smoothness
from
the
combination
of
the
flavors
which
is
outstanding
this
makes
the
mouthfeel
luxurious
the
aftertaste
is
somewhat
sticky
medium
bodied
properly
carbonated
and
very
drinkable
i
love
the
boulevard
smokestack
series
beers
the
beer
pours
a
cloudy
amberorangish
color
with
a
12
offwhite
head
that
slowly
fades
to
lacing
the
aroma
is
great
it
has
a
very
nice
malt
scent
thats
simplistic
mostly
pale
maybe
some
light
crystal
malts
the
bourbon
barrel
aroma
is
outstanding
wow
the
wood
really
comes
through
and
squashes
any
alcohol
warmth
there
are
some
light
belgian
yeast
esters
in
there
as
well
the
taste
is
also
very
good
it
has
an
excellent
wood
character
that
melds
well
with
the
alcohol
warmth
and
the
sweet
malt
flavor
it
goes
down
slow
and
easy
with
some
light
esters
in
the
finish
the
mouthfeel
is
fine
it
is
a
full
bodied
beer
with
adequate
carbonation
this
is
a
damn
fine
quad
its
complex
yet
highly
drinkable
great
job
drinkability
i
really
liked
this
and
after
my
first
sip
i
didnt
think
i
would
as
much
as
i
did
the
11
is
really
well
hidden
and
everything
came
together
nicely
i
would
have
liked
the
cherries
to
be
a
bit
more
pronounced
but
then
again
i
really
love
fruit
glad
i
got
to
finally
try
one
750
ml
caged
and
corked
bottle
1967
of
11248
batch
22009
best
by
102012
served
in
a
snifter
the
beer
pours
a
murky
reddishbrown
color
with
about
an
inch
colalike
tan
head
that
didnt
stay
around
for
long
theres
a
decent
amount
of
lacing
left
on
the
glass
aroma
is
bourbon
smoke
oak
vanilla
tart
cherries
and
brown
sugar
the
taste
is
pretty
much
the
same
as
the
aroma
but
with
the
addition
of
some
sweet
cherries
figs
and
some
spice
all
of
the
flavors
mesh
well
together
and
none
of
them
seem
to
overpower
the
others
mouthfeelbody
is
medium
its
well
carbonated
and
a
bit
creamy
and
slick
drinkability
is
very
good
the
soft
carbonation
makes
this
easy
to
drink
considering
the
11
8
abv
i
think
this
is
a
good
brew
i
definitely
enjoyed
it
and
im
glad
i
picked
this
one
up
overall
i
was
expecting
some
great
stuff
but
disappointed
by
the
blandness
and
lack
of
hiding
the
alcohol
overall
a
much
better
beer
than
i
was
expecting
nice
complexity
of
flavors
but
balanced
as
well
the
feel
is
perfectly
appropriate
slightly
carbonated
and
not
watery
but
thin
enough
that
allows
this
beer
to
go
down
well
a
sipping
beer
through
and
through
due
to
its
bold
flavors
and
high
alcohol
content
but
one
that
is
a
delight
to
taste
again
and
again
drinkability
was
amazing
for
such
a
strong
beer
i
accidentally
drank
2
samples
apologies
to
my
wonderful
understanding
fiancee
sorry
for
the
mixup
we
have
another
bottle
with
your
name
on
it
overall
a
really
great
unique
well
crafted
beer
highly
recommended
overall
a
superb
effort
this
is
an
underrated
beer
as
far
as
i
am
concerned
one
of
the
better
things
i
have
had
the
pleasure
of
drinking
in
the
last
few
months
overall
a
fantastic
take
on
a
quad
almost
comes
across
like
a
very
fruity
barleywine
rather
than
a
quad
but
the
barrelaging
really
smoothed
out
the
beer
and
created
an
interesting
take
on
the
style
give
it
a
try
d
this
is
very
much
a
sipper
having
this
as
a
third
beer
of
the
night
shared
the
bottles
before
and
this
one
might
be
a
bit
of
a
mistake
every
sip
is
taking
a
toll
on
me
enjoyable
flavors
but
it
is
a
bit
rough
in
its
young
stage
thinking
about
aging
a
bottle
and
seeing
how
it
is
after
a
bit
of
time
notes
second
try
of
a
boulevard
big
bottle
and
im
really
impressed
nice
try
at
something
different
which
works
rather
well
with
a
nice
range
quite
remarkable
great
rarity
to
keep
around
and
enjoy
with
some
time
andor
entice
other
beer
aficionados
with
d
full
body
matches
strong
alcohol
bourbon
barrel
is
noticeable
and
in
good
portion
very
drinkable
beer
one
of
my
favorite
quads
while
the
flavors
are
not
subtle
they
are
not
extreme
this
is
a
nice
example
of
how
a
well
crafted
beer
can
easily
beat
the
more
more
more
mentality
of
extreme
beers
moderate
carbonation
and
creamy
mouthfeel
that
disappears
in
the
end
due
to
the
alcohol
very
nice
a
quadrupel
fermented
on
cherries
then
aged
in
bourbon
barrels
how
is
this
going
to
work
it
turns
out
it
works
quite
well
pours
a
reddish
brown
or
mahogany
color
with
a
large
beige
head
that
had
excellant
retention
the
head
settles
to
a
thick
cap
moderate
amount
of
sticky
lacing
is
left
on
the
glass
unique
aroma
for
a
quadrupel
it
is
a
combination
of
abbey
ale
with
yeast
esters
pale
malt
and
sugar
part
fruit
beer
with
the
cherries
very
much
evident
in
the
aroma
and
barrel
aged
with
bourbon
and
vanilla
notes
the
flavor
somehow
works
with
all
these
elements
in
play
unfortunately
the
belgian
aspect
looses
the
most
all
that
is
left
is
some
sweet
malt
and
yeasty
fruitiness
but
the
cherries
and
bourbon
makes
up
for
the
loss
a
cherrievanilla
bourbon
infused
drink
just
slightly
boozy
but
i
would
not
guess
it
is
up
at
11
80
the
mouthfeel
is
the
weakest
aspect
of
this
beer
but
it
still
pretty
good
just
a
little
light
and
overcarbonated
the
fizzy
carbonation
seems
inappropriate
for
the
style
i
had
critized
boulevard
for
not
being
the
most
creative
that
was
before
i
enjoyed
this
beer
guess
i
need
to
eat
my
words
like
a
late
autumn
afternoon
with
red
and
orange
leaves
falling
through
the
clear
sky
and
a
little
kick
in
your
step
there
is
some
heat
but
the
bourbon
feels
subdued
giving
way
to
a
tart
fig
dusted
by
the
vanilla
fairy
sassy
and
way
too
easy
like
your
sister
she
dances
all
over
my
tongue
before
its
too
late
and
im
spent
unfortunately
the
strong
alcohol
in
this
beer
is
overly
present
in
every
perceivable
way
and
takes
away
from
the
otherwise
artistry
of
balance
beneath
one
of
those
beers
first
sip
wow
beers
beautiful
dark
roasted
malts
some
oaky
wellmoderated
bourbon
notes
and
a
distinct
fresh
cherry
juice
finish
etoh
burns
quite
a
bit
at
the
finish
this
was
sampled
pretty
fresh
and
the
question
would
be
whether
a
bit
of
time
would
tame
the
heat
or
mute
the
bright
cherry
flavor
which
i
found
very
pleasant
a
question
i
hope
to
answer
someday
drinkability
this
is
such
a
unique
and
beautifully
crafted
beer
ive
already
added
it
to
my
wants
list
the
barrelaging
was
done
beautifully
a
great
great
experience
thanks
again
josh
o
the
true
beauty
of
this
beer
is
the
ability
for
boulevard
to
pull
such
a
big
complex
beer
together
in
unison
and
not
have
a
big
sloppy
booze
filled
mess
this
beer
was
balanced
the
flavors
were
not
over
run
or
overdone
by
the
bourbon
or
dark
fruits
well
meshed
crafted
brew
very
drinkable
and
tasty
mouthfeel
bravo
drinkability
is
pretty
good
im
enjoying
this
beer
its
just
not
as
smooth
as
would
b
ideal
a
nice
balance
of
big
flavor
without
being
overblown
and
undrinkable
could
stand
to
be
a
touch
cleaner
but
im
cutting
it
slack
from
the
bourbon
barrel
more
so
then
the
fermentation
its
not
as
full
and
creamy
as
i
might
want
from
a
quad
and
its
a
bit
thin
too
definitely
not
that
bad
though
dry
finish
as
far
as
drinkability
goes
this
one
is
a
tough
guy
the
aroma
really
makes
the
process
go
slowly
for
me
and
the
complexity
makes
it
hard
for
me
to
figure
this
one
out
interesting
im
glad
i
had
it
although
i
think
that
the
only
way
i
would
want
it
again
would
be
with
some
age
on
it
notes
the
beer
definitely
shocked
me
at
first
it
had
a
lot
of
bourbon
upfront
but
wasnt
overpowering
the
balance
between
the
oak
bourbon
cherries
is
very
good
however
there
is
a
lot
going
on
in
this
beer
and
the
quadrupel
base
is
slightly
lost
overall
it
is
a
good
beer
the
high
abv
is
hidden
well
and
im
enjoying
it
more
as
i
drink
and
as
the
beer
warms
the
carbonation
is
my
biggest
issue
i
would
like
for
it
to
be
slightly
more
carbonated
d
rating
this
as
a
quad
does
it
injustice
i
think
sure
its
highly
rated
on
the
site
and
its
very
delicious
so
i
will
adjust
the
score
a
little
but
this
isnt
what
i
think
of
when
i
think
quad
good
beer
prolly
not
as
great
as
people
make
it
seem
but
worth
a
shot
as
much
as
i
enjoyed
it
this
time
i
can
only
imagine
what
it
will
be
like
next
winter
opening
one
of
these
with
some
age
on
it
a
real
treat
from
boulevard
i
would
highly
recommend
this
is
truly
a
great
beer
i
really
wish
i
got
a
chance
to
try
the
first
batch
so
i
could
make
comparisons
i
have
a
couple
bottles
for
the
cellar
to
see
how
this
improves
over
the
course
of
a
year
or
two
cant
wait
to
try
this
with
some
time
on
it
pours
a
cloudy
dark
brown
color
with
a
lighter
amber
along
the
edges
and
bottom
of
the
glass
one
inch
head
of
an
offwhite
color
great
retention
and
good
lacing
smells
of
strong
alcohol
sweet
malt
and
slight
dark
citrus
fits
the
style
of
a
quadrupel
mouth
feel
is
smooth
and
crisp
with
an
average
carbonation
level
tastes
of
strong
alcohol
bourbon
characteristics
are
noticeable
wood
slight
sweet
malt
and
a
slight
dark
citrus
overall
very
strong
in
alcohol
flavor
not
wellblended
and
the
alcohol
bourbonwood
coats
the
tongue
in
a
very
cloying
fashion
d
at
11
8
this
goes
down
so
incredibly
smooth
very
nice
and
very
tasty
this
is
a
fantastic
beer
if
you
find
it
buy
it
immediately
drink
one
and
lay
the
other
down
for
awhile
d
good
for
the
abv
very
good
sipper
i
wish
i
could
find
boulevard
beers
out
in
la
tastes
well
taste
great
need
i
say
more
the
bourbon
stands
out
for
me
being
a
bourbon
drinker
from
time
to
time
almost
complex
picking
up
on
many
flavors
with
every
sip
sweet
malt
and
fruit
hiding
beneath
the
oak
aging
over
all
this
is
a
great
beer
if
you
are
lucky
enough
to
find
it
grab
it
and
grab
some
extra
for
aging
i
happened
to
be
at
princeton
liquors
at
the
right
time
and
giddily
picked
up
a
bottle
for
12
50
i
shared
it
with
a
few
friends
but
honestly
i
wouldnt
mind
finishing
a
bottle
by
myself
the
aroma
was
an
enticing
fig
and
bourbon
mixture
than
without
a
doubt
smelled
better
than
any
whiskey
id
ever
sampled
the
flavor
is
again
light
on
the
belgian
notes
with
mild
spice
and
dried
fruit
but
it
provides
a
great
backbone
for
a
rich
and
tasty
bourbon
candy
flavor
this
quad
has
some
body
but
its
still
dry
and
not
overly
thick
if
you
ever
come
across
this
beer
buy
it
immediately
overall
a
very
pleasing
and
nicely
balanced
ale
the
blend
of
wood
aged
and
cherry
notes
really
give
this
beer
a
nice
complexity
without
being
overbearing
the
malt
complexity
in
the
flavor
seems
to
develop
as
you
sip
and
probably
goes
well
beyond
my
own
description
i
really
enjoy
the
hint
of
sour
in
this
beer
and
i
wonder
perhaps
if
brettanomyces
has
been
used
somewhere
in
the
process
though
i
suspect
its
really
from
the
barrel
aging
brett
would
be
a
welcome
addition
to
this
series
however
the
qualities
of
bourbon
really
dont
come
out
in
this
beer
very
well
considering
the
name
i
was
expected
a
lot
more
notes
this
was
my
first
bourbon
barrelaged
beer
i
was
a
little
skeptical
but
ended
up
very
pleased
the
bourbon
character
complements
the
yeastheavy
beer
i
also
have
not
had
many
oakaged
beers
in
general
that
aspect
gave
this
beer
a
subtle
bready
funky
texture
i
hope
i
can
find
this
again
for
a
special
treat
overall
this
would
likely
improve
in
the
cellar
but
i
dont
know
the
cherry
dominance
would
dissipate
and
that
was
the
main
problem
i
found
with
this
beer
i
find
it
too
strong
and
overpowers
the
others
and
detracts
from
what
could
be
a
very
smooth
and
complex
beer
there
might
even
be
too
much
going
on
generally
it
was
also
too
hot
but
that
could
mellow
with
time
as
a
quad
fan
whatever
a
quad
is
i
was
quite
excited
to
try
this
but
the
experience
left
me
a
bit
underwhelmed
i
definitely
like
boulevards
sixth
glass
quad
much
better
id
try
this
again
though
but
would
age
it
for
at
least
a
couple
of
years
d
very
drinkable
this
bottle
was
gone
in
no
time
really
excellent
beer
overall
wow
i
was
amazed
by
this
beer
everything
i
could
ask
for
in
a
quad
simply
amazing
the
oak
and
bourbon
really
makes
this
beer
click
this
beer
drank
so
fast
i
need
to
get
more
of
this
beer
before
it
is
gone
highly
drinkable
very
good
unique
beer
from
boulevard
id
definitely
buy
this
again
if
i
saw
it
in

overall
im
not
quite
sure
this
is
a
quad
but
regardless
it
definitely
is
one
of
the
most
interesting
beers
i
have
had
the
fruit
flavors
and
the
bourbon
paired
very
well
together
highly
recommended
pours
dark
brown
with
a
cream
colored
head
aroma
is
belgian
yeast
and
slightly
sour
dark
fruit
get
some
tart
cherries
and
alcohol
the
flavor
is
very
complex
with
bourbon
vanilla
caramel
cherry
oak
and
alcohol
all
making
appearances
the
beer
is
slightly
boozy
medium
body
and
medium
carbonation
even
with
the
beer
being
nearly
12
percent
it
is
easy
to
drink
that
being
said
it
is
still
a
sipper
that
gets
better
as
it
warms
d
dangerously
drinkable
this
goes
down
very
easily
the
balance
of
malt
bourbon
cherries
and
alcohol
makes
this
very
delicious
this
is
an
excellent
after
dinner
beer
complex
yet
approachable
very
enjoyable

great
quad
with
noticeable
bourbon
character
bourbon
and
brown
fruits
in
the
nose
with
a
mild
yeast
presence
which
was
nice
complex
and
you
can
tell
it
was
aged
in
the
bourbon
barrels
has
a
pronounced
whiskey
backbone
and
dried
jammy
fruits
like
dates
white
raisin
insides
and
a
caramel
malty
sweetness
if
you
like
quads
i
would
recommend
this
to
you
quality
beer
and
worth
every
penny
smooth
and
easy
drinking
brew
warming
without
being
hot
perfect
for
a
cold
winter
night
while
it
may
not
rate
as
high
as
some
this
has
been
one
of
my
most
enjoyable
beers
of
the
year
enjoyable
sipper
which
will
be
savored
til
the
last
drop
interesting
beer
not
a
true
quad
but
a
good
belgian
strong
ale
the
cherries
and
barrel
aging
add
some
complexity
but
this
definately
needs
some
time
to
come
together
mouthfeel
is
medium
bodied
with
low
carbonation
levels
that
make
it
feel
a
bit
heavier
than
it
is
drinkability
is
pretty
low
here
for
me
there
is
really
not
much
to
make
this
beer
stand
out
for
me
i
feel
the
potential
is
here
but
there
are
too
many
off
flavors
for
the
good
aspects
to
overcome
worth
a
try
if
you
can
find
it
and
i
plan
to
lay
a
few
down
to
see
how
they
age
i
love
the
oak
definitely
worth
the
try
if
you
like
strong
oaky
belgians
a
solid
brew
in
my
book
d
its
a
frigid
three
degrees
f
outside
as
i
type
this
bbq
is
keeping
me
nice
and
warm
my
bottle
went
down
faster
than
the
generous
abv
should
have
allowed
a
perfect
beer
for
a
frozen
night
heck
even
my
cat
likes
it
aggressively
poured

cloudy
darker
reddish
hued

loose
light

thats
gone
in
a
flash
leaving
negligible
belgian
lacing
behind
the
smell
from
the
from
the
bottle
is
one
of
the
best
things
about
this
one
big
on
bourbon
fig
and
cinnamon
almond
modestly
carbonated
the
mouth
feel
is
surprisingly
light
smooth
and
creamy
you
get
a
light
bourbon
tang
while
the
sweetness
of
the
flavors
grabs
your
attention
it
cleans
up
pretty
quickly
almost
dry
full
flavored
the
bourbon
fig
harvest
fruit
and
cinnamon
tastes
is
quite
good
its
really
hard
too
imagine
that
this

well

some
this
beer
suffers
from
a
lack
of
c02
imho
the
feel
is
sub
par
because
of
this
the
overall
flavor
i
think
will
improve
with
age
though
not
bad

caramel

smells

tastes
of
those
qualities
as
well
very
sweet
brown
sugary
a
tad
of
vanilla
fairly
thick

without
much
carbonation
though
its
definitely
present
in
sufficient
quantities
to
balance
out
that
thick
sugary

overall
a
very

i
picked
this
up
despite
the
high
price
based
off
of
my
good
experiences
with
other
smokestack
beers
the
smell
is
sweet
then
tart
cherries
smells
good
the
flavor
is
nice
sweet
slight
bit
of
cherry
vanilla
wood
and
oddly
i
cannot
detect
bourbon
just
a
bit
of
booziness
in
the
back
it
seems
similar
to
the
sixth
glass
but
i
think
this
might
be
slightly
better
hard
to
say
d
there
is
a
lot
to
this
beer
and
i
could
pick
things
out
of
it
all
night
long
a
nice
sipping
beer
had
a
bottle
of
this
last
summer
the
colour
was
a
very
cloudy
amber
with
just
a
thin
hint
of
head
the
aroma
was
quite
bourbon
like
with
hops
and
cherries
as
well
on
the
palate
there
was
alcohol
bourbon
alcohol
cherries
alcohol
malt
alcohol
yow
just
a
bit
of
the
booze
aspect
here
but
still
some
actual
flavours
to
carry
it
along
drinkability
is
scary
11
8abv
i
drank
the
whole
bottle
way
too
fast
an
interesting
beer
im
only
slightly
disappointed
in
the
light
amount
of
bourbon
flavors
that
made
it
through
which
im
not
sure
is
tied
to
the
aging
of
the
beer
or
my
opinion
that
quads
dont
lend
themselves
well
to
bourbon
aging
or
flavors
this
is
a
terrific
beer
that
belongs
among
the
best
thanks

to
anyone
with

some

ill
end

simply
this

make

it
is

yum
d
what
a
fantastic

consider
us
way
more
than
impressed
d
while
you
should
probably
split
this
with
a
friend
and
savor
each
sip
i
tend
to
drink
a
bottle
to
myself
because
it
is
so
drinkable

very

thanks
randy
dtoo
good
considering
the
abv
it
goes
down
easy
d
very
enjoyable
with
a
complexity
pushed
along
by
numerous
subtleties
from
the
oaky
characteristics
to
the
cherrtart
to
the
delicious
quad
foundation
d
im
glad
i
shared
the
bottle
750ml
would
of
been
to
much
for
me
and
i
would
of
been
tired
of
it
after
12oz
this
is
a
drinkable
quad
with
nice
flavors
but
does
not
hold
up
to
others
im
going
to
call
this
a
neoquad
as
it
is
not
exactly
a
quad
with
the
barrel
aging
involved
maybe
im
just
not
used
to
this
style
being
baed
thanks
to
phidelt
for
the
opportunity
to
try
this
one
750ml
bottle
served
in
my
allagash
tulip
bottle
3253
out
of
10630
poured
a
dark
copper
with
a
halfinch
offwhite
head
that
quickly
dissipated
nose
reveals
cherries
and
some
bourbon
notes
taste
consistent
with
nose
sour
cherries
bourbon
notes
but
also
some
wood
mouthfeel
seems
a
little
offstyle
mediumbodied
and
lightly
effervescent
with
a
dry
finish
a
decent
brew
with
a
wellhidden
abv
but
i
was
expecting
something
a
little
bolder
out
of
this
one
well
worth
your
time
if
you
can
get
a
bottle
this
isnt
an
a
for
the
quad
style
which
is
what
this
review
is
for
i
rate
on
style
not
a
quad
against
a
pale
ale
or
bock
or
whatnot
see
my
other
posts
i
tried
this
as
part
of
a
serious
beer
lineup
with
buckeyesox
and
others
thanks
dave
this
beer
opened
the
round
so
the
review
is
based
on
a
fresh
palate
poured
into
a
pintsized
3f
pint
glass
the
beer
was
a
hazy
auburn
reddish
brown
color
with
a
2finger
offwhite
foam
the
aroma
was
complex
dark
fruits
like
raisins
and
prunes
yeasty
esters
maybe
even
a
little
smokiness
and
vanilla
from
the
barrel
the
beer
tastes
just
as
complex
maybe
too
much
for
me
to
process
with
precision
it
was
sweet
with
a
little
acidic
bite
in
the
aftertaste
lots
of
esters
and
a
little
alcohol
heat
the
body
was
substantial
but
not
too
thick
very
good
overall
big
thanks
to
buckeyesox
for
the
opportunity
d
at
nearly
12
this
is
a
whopper
but
i
enjoyed
every
sip
im
glad
that
i
have
another
bottle
stashed
away
d
not
bad
hv
been
eagerly
awaiting
opening
this
bottle
one
of
my
favorite
styles
from
one
of
my
favorite
breweries
poured
from
750ml
bottle
number
01609
batch
20082
into
pint
glass
pours
deep
brownishred
with
a
ton
of
head
smell
is
liquor
cherries
and
malt
ive
let
this
beer
sit
for
over
ten
minutes
now
and
there
is
still
a
half
finger
of
head
with
gobs
of
head
still
stuck
to
the
sides
of
the
glass
wow
this
beer
is
friggin
awesome
i
cant
believe
how
smooth
this
beer
is
im
a
big
fan
of
quads
especially
american
versions
but
this
is
my
favorite
so
far
an
absolutely
amazing
beer
i
love
the
cherry
aftertaste
following
the
bourbon
lead
medium
bodied
mouthfeel
this
beer
is
way
too
drinkable
at
11
8abvper
the
bottle
if
this
was
a
regular
offering
it
would
easily
be
a
top
100
beer
everything
i
expected
and
more
in
this
limited
boulevard
offering
an
extraordinary
beer
just
awesome
d
fairly
good
clocking
in
at
almost
12
abv
it
definitely
will
creep
up
on
you
it
is
masked
fairly
well
so
i
wont
have
any
trouble
finishing
this
bottle
d
considering
the
abv
still
pretty
darned
drinkable
drinkability
i
liked
this
much
more
than
i
thought
i
would
ill
have
to
share
my
last
one
with
my
bourbonfan
neighbor
he
should
like
this
drinkability
pretty
good
what
did
you
think
bbq
was
a
rookie
brew
sure
you
can
find
better
quads
and
better
barrelaged
beers
but
this
one
still
manages
to
hold
its
own
drinkability
a
very
nice
quad
worthy
of
a
cork
and
cage
well
rounded
and
perfect
for
a
cool
evening
one
750
would
be
enough
great
taste
mouthfeel
tart
cherries
open
this
one
with
a
semidry
malt
foundation
beneath
drier
than
expected
and
im
grateful
for
it
subtle
bourbon
presence
just
a
touch
of
vanilla
and
toffeelike
sweetness
spicy
drying
finish
i
was
expecting
more
balance
between
the
cherries
and
the
bourbon
something
along
the
lines
of
cuvee
de
tomme
but
this
is
still
very
good
quite
an
interesting
beer
the
barrel
character
is
very
subtle
all
around
this
actually
isnt
a
bad
thing
the
flavor
and
aroma
are
definitely
influenced
by
the
barrel
but
it
is
subtle
enough
that
i
might
not
have
guessed
it
was
here
if
i
hadnt
known
before
hand
this
could
perhaps
use
a
bit
more
richness
to
the
beer
but
i
do
like
the
relatively
dry
quality
that
this
beer
has
it
makes
it
a
bit
more
savory
than
your
typical
quad
when
this
doesnt
get
hot
in
the
finish
it
tastes
quite
nice
and
tasty
nice
but
seems
to
lack
something
in
both
the
flavor
and
aroma
that
would
set
it
up
to
achieve
the
next
level
of
flavor
standout
complex
brew
this
is
a
bottle
to
share
for
sure
a
couple
45
oz
pours
is
quite
a
bit
of
this
monster
wasnt
blown
away
by
this
but
would
gladly
have
again
good
job

this

the
third
time
i
have
had
this
beer
now
drinking
this
as
i
type
the

right

poured

oak
vanilla
light
whiskey
brown
sugar
sweet

caramel
and
earthiness
flavor
starts
off
with
a
little
tart
malts
and
sweetness
in
the
middle
oak
and
vanilla
in
the
finish
with
a
little
warmth
from
the
bourbon
although
it
is
not
very
prominent
until
later
when
it
fully
warms
crisp
carbonation
gives
a
bit
of
a
bite
and
lets
the
tartiness
shine
a
little
bit
sweet
slightly
hot
sugary
and
tart
mouthfeel
medium
bodied
but
on
the
thinner
side
taste
lingers
very
well
and
is
one
of
my
favorite
parts
of
this
beer
could
drink
this
whole
bottle
myself
alcohol
is
hidden
pretty
well
smooth
for
the
most
part
not
too
sweet
have
not
have
many
barrel
aged
quadrupels
but
this
is
quite
good
among
the
few
i
have
tasted
really
dig
the
cherry
component
too
not
a
bad
price
either
this
will
probably
age
with
all
the
malt
and
sugar
not
to
mention
the
abv
that
is
nearly
twelve
percent
would
drink
again
recommended
poured
into
a
chalice
a
very
nice
cloudy
amber
color
very
nice
carbonation
very
nice
onefinger
plus
thick
creamy
offwhite
head
with
some
nice
thick
sticky
lacing
left
behind
the
nose
is
malty
with
some
nice
bourbon
notes
some
nice
dark
fruits
slight
spice
the
taste
is
absolutely
delicious
malty
slight
yeast
cherries
figs
plums
bourbon
and
some
spice
full
body
the
abv
is
hidden
very
well
very
drinkable
this
is
a
very
nice
brew
thanks
tim
and
bill
drinkability
a
solid
beer
but
i
dont
see
myself
drinking
much
more
than
2
glasses
at
one
sitting
if
this
were
available
i
would
purchase
this
again
most
notable
flavor
for
me
on
this
is
the
spice
warming
alcohol
on
the
back
end
i
get
a
very
subtle
cherry
and
vanilla
as
stated
on
the
bottle
warmth
from
the
booze
really
sticks
around
in
the
mouth
boulevard
has
one
very
nice
quad
on
their
hands
d
this
is
a
very
good
quad
i
really
liked
the
cherry
flavor
to
it
but
was
hoping
for
a
bit
more
bourbon
this
was
a
very
good
beer
nonetheless
and
has
made
me
very
excited
to
try
others
in
the
smokestack
series
drinkability
certainly
interesting
but
the
combination
of
the
sour
cherry
and
bourbon
flavors
just
doesnt
cut
it
for
me
from
a
drinkability
perspective
this
beer
pours
a
sharp
brown
color
the
head
is
a
firm
two
inches
of
foam
which
recedes
slowly
into
a
solid
cap
of
lacing
that
lasts
until
the
beer
is
gone
the
aroma
is
of
dates
figs
sweet
bourbon
and
hints
of
anise
the
taste
has
a
little
less
bourbon
than
the
aroma
but
what
it
does
have
is
in
perfect
balance
it
begins
with
dates
figs
anise
and
a
round
sweetness
that
leads
into
a
beautiful
bourbon
finish
the
mouthfeel
is
full
bodied
with
lively
carbonation
overall
this
is
a
great
beer
i
really
like
how
the
bourbon
is
a
part
of
the
beer
without
dominating
it
i
would
love
to
drink
this
again
bottom
line
if
theres
such
a
thing
as
a
typical
quadrupel
this
sure
isnt
one
but
dang
its
a
damn
interesting
brew
and
i
enjoyed
the
first
sips
just
as
much
as
the
last
ones
and
everything
in
between
im
happy
i
gave
this
one
a
go
overall
this
is
an
ok
quad
it
has
some
funk
going
on
and
the
bourbon
barrel
had
less
of
a
presence
then
i
had
expected
overall
this
is
an
ok
quad
quite
different
the
bourbon
barrel
only
provides
an
oaky
smelltaste
and
not
a
strong
one
very
heavy
on
the
bourbon
and
this
beer
is
about
the
bourbon
as
much
as
it
is
the
quad
base
a
big
bruiser
which
should
be
good
in
the
cellar
for
at
least
20
years
damn
oh
my
god
i
feel
special
having
this
beer
to
drink
and
have
to
review
it
the
smell
i
s
like
a
barrel
but
a
nice
dank
beer
barrel
and
the
smell
is
better
after
swirling
it
in
my
glass
the
taste
is
like
fuck
so
many
flavors
at
once
i
have
to
swirl
it
in
my
mouth
as
well
to
get
it
into
every
corner
fruit
and
wood
and
yes
i
can
taste
the
cherries
a
bit
mouthfeel
and
drinkability
i
could
hold
this
beer
in
my
mouth
for
so
long
apparently
bud
light
has
drinkability
if
i
tried
to
hold
a
bl
in
my
mouth
for
a
while
i
think
i
might
throw
up
this
is
so
easy
to
drink
because
it
is
so
complex
so
tastefilled
and
colorful
this
feels
like
liquid
velvet
on
my
tongue
damn
this
is
a
good
beer
i
need
to
buy
another
and
celler
it
for
several
years
so
i
can
enjoy
it
again
this
complex
beer
has
just
the
right
amount
of
carbonation
and
smoothness
to
allow
it
to
be
enjoyed
without
taking
away
from
what
should
really
be
savored
here
and
that
is
the
savory
flavor
boulevard
proves
it
knows
how
to
do
what
kc
does
best
bbq
the
more
quads
i
drink
the
more
i
am
getting
into
them
nice
to
see
a
local
brewer
jump
in
the
fray
i
liked
the
6th
glass
but
this
is
damn
near
perfect
in
my
opinion
bottle
02706
of
10630
this
is
an
absolutely
fantastic
beer
easily
one
of
the
best
ive
ever
had
would
take
this
in
a
heartbeat
over
most
any
of
the
belgian
quads
st
bernie
rochefort
etc
i
still
can
hardly
believe
this
is
brewed
in
kc
mo
such
a
great
beer
this
is
a
top
notch
freaking
beer
boulevard
took
their
time
with
this
guy
and
knocked
out
a
winner
they
are
spot
on
with
a
style
thats
hard
to
reproduce
but
throw
in
just
a
bit
of
their
own
take
on
it
well
done
d
this
was
really
amazing
great
tasting
i
wish
they
had
made
more
dark
brown
color
with
a
smooth
silky
creamy
long
lasting
head
of
white
foam
aromatics
are
very
simple
a
touch
of
cherry
not
much
quad
left
in
here
as
the
flavor
is
dominated
by
whiskey
and
sour
fruits
too
sour
with
no
malt
depth
the
oak
contribution
didnt
provide
much
nuance
of
coconut
and
vanilla
just
funk
not
a
beer
i
enjoy
the
abv
is
extremely
well
disguised
not
as
fruitty
or
malty
as
i
hoped
liked
it
about
as
much
as
the
sixth
glass
version
both
have
their
charms
a
few
minor
detractors
to
me
this
like
an
amped
up
slightly
better
version
troegs
mad
elf
having
never
had
any
of
the
one
offs
of
the
elf
extra
i
was
very
fortunate
to
get
a
847
bottle
out
of
10630
produced
im
sure
10630
taste
just
as
good
as
number1
but
i
felt
cool
anyway
this
beer
really
taught
me
how
to
drink
quality
beers
the
sipping
fashion
when
drank
slowly
this
beer
simply
glows
when
guzzled
its
a
trademark
ale
poured
a
750ml
corked
and
caged
into
my
tripel
karmeliet
tulip
this
beer
poured
an
orangey
muddy
brown
with
a
huge
beige
head
that
left
some
serious
lacing
as
the
head
receded
into
just
a
thin
film
the
aroma
is
really
complex
with
oak
and
bourbon
coming
through
but
also
vanilla
cherries
a
mild
citrus
aroma
toffee
and
some
belgian
yeast
spiciness
this
beer
definitely
has
the
most
complex
aroma
of
any
beer
boulevard
has
put
out
to
date
and
one
of
the
more
complex
aromas
of
the
beers
ive
tried
the
flavor
is
more
in
line
with
the
sixth
glass
and
other
quads
fig
date
other
dark
fruits
brown
sugar
green
apple
cocoa
powder
and
a
bit
of
cherry
are
all
prevalent
but
what
really
sets
the
flavor
apart
from
other
quads
is
the
oak
and
bourbon
flavors
that
show
up
at
the
end
of
the
taste
profile
this
is
really
a
superb
beer
the
mouthfeel
is
nice
a
full
with
a
bit
of
booze
that
lingers
on
the
palate
this
is
a
great
beer
boulevard
has
really
gone
above
and
beyond
with
this
one
dnot
something
i
want
to
drink
all
the
time
but
one
ill
keep
on
hand
cellered
for
when
the
time
hits
mouth
is
thick
and
smooth
medium
carbonation
truly
a
great
variation
of
the
quadrupel
boulevard
impresses
me
again
hands
down
the
best
quad
i
have
tried
this
is
unique
to
every
other
example
i
have
had
of
this
style
i
can
thank
the
fruity
spiciness
funky
and
sour
malt
for
that
funky
in
a
good
belgian
strong
ale
kind
of
way
wonderful
and
highly
recommended
mouthfeeldrinkability
light
bodied
and
easy
going
carbonation
is
effervescent
yet
not
gassy
its
easy
drinking
for
a
big
beer
the
alcohol
is
noticeable
in
the
flavor
but
for
such
a
big
beer
its
really
not
a
nuisance
this
is
pretty
damn
good
but
for
the
high
price
tag
ill
probably
not
revisit
this
any
time
soon
overall
impression
this
is
a
good
beer
but
not
the
most
fantastic
example
of
the
style
i
think
that
with
a
year
or
three
of
aging
that
this
beer
would
be
much
better
much
of
the
more
negative
qualities
of
this
beer
are
simply
because
its
still
young
my
recommendation
is
to
pick
up
a
bottle
or
two
and
let
them
sit
for
at
least
one
year
the
alcohol
at
11
8
is
powerful
but
really
only
in
the
nose
and
a
some
warmness
in
the
swallow
first
sip
you
get
some
tartness
from
the
cherries
but
its
not
anywhere
close
to
making
you
think
this
is
a
fruit
beer
its
more
of
a
highlight
in
the
taste
which
then
segues
into
the
oakiness
after
that
you
get
the
bourbon
taste
each
sip
is
a
mouthful
and
this
is
best
enjoyed
on
a
cold
winter
day
sipping
d
boulevard
continues
to
take
its
game
to
the
next
level
the
sixth
glass
was
great
but
bbq
is
worldclass
i
cant
wait
to
hear
what
will
come
next
from
the
special
limited
release
line
of
the
smokestack
series
thank
you
boulevard
you
have
always
been
my
hometown
brewery
but
you
are
coming
up
with
more
and
more
reasons
for
me
to
consider
you
one
of
my
favorite
breweries
ever
hometown
bias
aside
long
finish
full
body
luxurious
mouthfeel
nearly
decadent
flavor
this
is
a
rare
and
delicious
treat
not
the
best
quad
i
have
had
but
definately
worth
getting
again
oh
and
the
sixth
glass
is
still
the
best
in
my
opinion
of
the
smokestack
series
the
bbq

here
i
am
brewed
with
cherries
overall
a
wowzer
of
beer
very
complex
but
very
easy
to
drink
definitely
an
after
dinner
sipper
o
one
of
the
best
quads
made
in
the
states
a
great
example
of
this
classic
belgian
style
total
4650
a
heavy
and
complex
beer
i
wish
i
could
rate
it
higher
for
its
quality
but
i
cant
due
to
my
personal
taste
poured
into
a
belgian
glass
huge
head
on
it
about
4in
and
probably
poor
on
my
end
aroma
of
sweet
figs
and
caramel
tastes
like
it
smells
front
end
has
a
sweet
fig
taste
absolutely
delicious
ends
with
a
slight
alcohol
taste
and
a
malty
caramel
finish
delicious
quad
o
very
complex
aromas
and
flavors
just
at
the
upperend
of
sweetness
was
strong
but
not
completely
overpowering
price
right
and
exceptional
for
the
price
one
for
the
best
belgian
quads
out
there
in
the
usa
overall
not
he
best
quad
ive
had
but
still
very
good
wouldve
liked
to
have
seen
a
slightly
larger
malt
presence
poured
from
12
oz
bottle
into
snifter
instructions
say
to
pour
this
slowly
and
you
need
to
do
that
or
else
youre
going
to
be
left
with
one
giant
head
i
did
it
very
slowly
but
there
was
still
significant
head
to
it
i
let
it
sit
for
a
bit
and
once
it
settled
the
head
was
a
beautiful
brownishwhite
layer
of
fluff
it
retained
itself
throughout
the
drink
and
provided
the
ale
a
nice
creamy
element
lacing
was
superb
the
ale
is
smooth
with
the
cherries
providing
a
very
nice
touch
this
is
overall
a
tremendous
beer
and
i
think
absolutely
a
topten
quad
im
not
a
huge
fan
of
belgian
or
belgian
style
beers
but
this
wasnt
bad
very
bready
and
crisp
fruity
and
bright
and
effervescent
with
a
luxurious
velvety
mouthfeel
ommegang
does
not
disappointment
here
im
always
feeling
pretty
fantastic
after
drinking
a
bottle
of
this
one
i
want
to
be
the
fourth
philosopher
overall
this
is
definitely
the
most
exquisite
beer
i
have
had
it
is
amazingly
good
value
and
i
am
laughing
right
now
because
i
completely
forgot
i
was
drinking
a
beer
with
morello
sour
cherries
added
that
is
quite
the
accomplishment
then
because
it
shows
the
balance
and
character
they
have
achieved
in
this
masterful
brew
cheers
o
i
love
all
the
offerings
from
ommegang
and
this
is
one
of
my
favorites
comforting
in
its
familiarities
and
exciting
in
its
differences
another
great
belgian
example
from
ommegang
the
mouth
fell
felt
a
little
light
and
champaign
but
im
still
learning
how
to
discern
subtle
nuances
overall
great
quad
ooooomfph
now
thats
a
beer
tread
lightly
my
friends
any
cherry
at
all
its
not
terrible
but
i
wouldnt
pick
it
up
again
pours
a
hazy
dark
amber
body
with
a
big
creamy
head
smells
of
dark
fruits
like
cherries
dates
and
raisins
and
at
almost
10
alcohol
it
makes
an
appearance
aswell
taste
is
essentially
the
same
as
the
smell
would
imply
very
sweet
fruity
and
the
alcohol
packs
a
punch
but
is
still
enjoyable
has
a
very
thick
mouth
feel
it
kinda
leaves
a
film
coating
your
mouth
and
it
has
fairly
low
carbonation
overall
pretty
good
beer
but
is
a
bit
on
the
pricy
side
i
was
pissed
off
how
much
i
paid
for
it
im
a
cheap
batard
but
oh
my
it
hasnt
been
this
good
since
i
was
in
brugge
their
making
this
in
new
york
lordy
we
might
find
some
monks
out
of
work
strong
dark
and
oh
so
sweet
had
at
pittsburgh
winter
beerfest
o
complex
layered
on
the
sweeter
side
definitely
a
dessert
drink
nice
complex
beer
my
only
negative
is
it
was
a
bit
too
sweet
for
me
smells
and
tastes
awesome
great
cherry
flavor
that
goes
down
smoothly
no
weird
aftertastes
overall
great
beer
that
is
complex
and
full
of
flavor
had
fun
with
this
one
good
but
not
really
my
taste
a
bit
bitter
and
fruity
unique
sour
taste
quite
good
beautiful

fantastic

12oz
bottle
tulip
best
beer
from
ommegang
in
my
book
one
of
my
alltime
favourites
not
a
fan
of
this
one
o
a
complex
layered
beer
a
lot
going
on
here
the
residual
sweetness
needs
to
be
balanced
out
a
bit
but
an
excellent
sipper
type
of
serving
from
a
750ml
bottle
into
a
chimay
glass
would
not
buy
this
again
my
first
quadrupel
so
i
dont
have
a
standard
of
comparison
it
was
ok
but
too
fruitymalty
for
my
taste
not
one
of
the
better
quads
ive
had
and
a
little
more
bitter
than
i
like
for
the
style
the
kriek
does
very
little
for
this
beer
malt
bomb
i
like
their
dubbel
ale
much
better
this
is
a
marvelous
beer
pricy
no
doubt
at
4
49
a
single
but
its
easily
world
class
in
the
style
big
fan
of
this
one
o
this
is
a
awesome
e
example
of
a
belgian
quad
it
does
not
overtake
any
particular
aspects
of
itself
just
very
well
balanced
it
would
go
good
with
plenty
of
kinds
of
food
for
the
price
point
it
is
a
great
beer
oa
unique
full
bodied
that
displays
a
lot
of
complexity
wasnt
sure
how
id
feel
about
this
beer
at
first
but
its
very
nice
smooth
great
flavor
this
style
is
not
to
my
liking
pours
deep
brown
high
in
carbonation
thick
vanilla
colored
two
finger
head
roasty
malty
ommegang
has
yet
to
disappoint
me
i
have
a
question
this
may
sound
dumb
but
its
just
a
little
confusing
to
me
well
first
of
all
i
love
this
beer
one
of
my
favorites
anyway
when
im
rating
a
beer
lets
say
the
color
is
the
color
rating
based
on
how
light
or
dark
it
is
or
is
it
based
on
how
pretty
or
ugly
it
is
with
the
smell
is
it
how
good
or
bad
it
smells
or
how
potent
or
non
potent
it
smells
do
these
questions
make
sense
or
am
i
just
a
stupid
dummy
pardon
my
ratings
again
i
dont
know
what
they
mean
ill
change
them
once
i
know
perfect
for
sitting
by
the
fire
reading
a
book
o
three
philosophers
is
a
quad
away
from
the
pack
the
addition
of
true
belgian
kriek
give
this
brew
a
really
unique
twist
that
makes
this
beer
feel
like
luxurious
desert
in
a
glass
while
not
strictly
true
to
style
this
beer
if
a
must
try
if
youre
a
fan
of
all
things
strong
dark
and
belgian
generally
i
have
found
ommegang
beers
less
than
expected
but
this
one
was
good
although
not
great
a
hint
of
cherry
not
as
dense
and
malty
as
most
quadrupels
poured
a
750
into
a
goblet
a
reddish
brown
beer
fills
the
goblet
offering
a
hearty
cream
colored
head
it
smells
just
like
a
belgian
quad
dates
raisins
defiantly
fruits
of
that
nature
i
get
the
cherry
straightforward
upon
sipping
not
overwhelming
just
the
right
amount
of
blend
with
the
kriek
slight
carbonation
in
the
mouth
a
real
nice
quad

very
enjoyable
beer
its
only

cherry

and
i
would
suggest
they
push
the
cherry
a
little
more
and
see
what
happens
this
beer
tasted
so
good
i
drank
almost
the
whole
glass
before
i
started
my
review
of
course
i
have
3
more
cooling
in
the
fridge
i
enjoy
ommegang
but
i
think
i
like
visiting
the
baseball
hall
of
fame
even
better
this
was
one
of
my
favorite
christmas
gifts
i
love
the
name
the
packaging
and
ive
been
very
interested
in
trying
an
ommegang
beer
for
a
long
time
this
definitely
fits
the
ba
mantra
of
drink
better
drink
less
i
really
like
the
way
this
one
looks
and
smells
the
aroma
gives
you
no
illusions
it
says
i
am
a
yeasty
fruity
boozy
beast
of
a
beer
there
is
plenty
of
raisin
and
black
cherry
in
both
the
nose
and
the
taste
the
finish
is
somewhat
tart
which
is
a
bit
unexpected
there
is
a
lovely
alcohol
burn
after
the
third
or
fourth
swallow
in
the
most
pleasant
way
possible
one
bottle
of
this
is
plenty
for
tonight
very
well
rounded
beer
one
of
my
favorites
could
be
a
easy
daily
drinker
lions
and
tigers
and
beers
oh
my
this
is
generally
not
my
my
favorite
style
of
beer
a
little
darker
and
sweeter
than
i
would
usually
drink
but
this
was
very
good
smooth
and
tasty
be
careful
i
imagine
the
high
abv
could
sneak
up
on
you
overalldrinkability
only
2
cherry
not
as
fruity
as
i
expected
its
really
just
a
hint
of
cherry
not
always
consistent
and
sometimes
tasting
a
bit
harsh
when
ommegang
gets
this
one
right
it
is
a
smooth
heavy
belgian
with
a
touch
of
cherry
dark
brown
color
fizzy
light
head
that
quickly
faded
no
lacing
aroma
was
figs
plums
raisins
with
some
tart
black
cherry
and
grassy
notes
taste
was
pretty
close
to
the
smell
with
the
tartness
from
the
cherries
melding
with
the
candi
sugar
sweetness
to
form
a
nice
complex
mix
with
just
the
right
amount
of
yeasty
funkiness
to
let
you
know
its
a
quad
the
mouthfeel
was
medium
bodied
nicely
carbonated
and
silky
smooth
overall
this
was
pretty
good
but
not
quite
up
the
stature
of
a
abt
12
or
a
rochefort
10
one
of
my
alltime
favorite
beers
packaged

pours
a
clear
dark

dark

lots
of

notes
of
stale

and
banana
earth
and

in
the
finish
feel
is
fluffy
but
carbonation
is
a
bit
aggressive
interesting
combo
pretty
tasty
love
the
brewery
love
their
quads
the
kriek
has
just
enough
fruit
to
send
the
whole
thing
wrongly
bitter
depending
on
the
batch
strong
notes
of
black
cherry
and
black
currant
very
fizzy
as
well
great
beer
great
taste
great
feel
this
beer
is
quite
good
a
beer
i
enjoy
every
time
i
get
my
hands
on
it
wow
i
had
seen
ratings
of
this
and
immediately
built
it
in
my
mind
to
be
a
life
changing
experience
and
while
it
did
fall
just
short
of
the
latter
description
it
certainly
wasnt
far
off
i
suppose
itd
get
a
full
5
out
of
me
if
its
finish
was
just
a
tad
smoother
because
i
really
cant
come
up
with
anything
else
legitimate
as
a
complaint
aroma
of
dark
fruits
and
breads
pours
ruddy
brown
clouded
body
with
a
more
than
generous
beige
head
head
lasts
and
produces
a
lacing
that
lingers
all
the
way
down
the
glass
taste
is
sour
cherry
a
touch
alkaline
very
alchoholic
unique
really
nice
beer
rich
malty
nose
big
body
maltysweet
some
of
the
characteristic
belgian
yeast
finish
came
through
agree
with
other
reviews
that
said
you
need
to
let
this
one
breathe
a
bit
before
diving
in
i
had
this
one
out
of
a
corked
bomber
bottle
a
little
bit
of
brussels
here
in
the
states
very
good
but
not
overwhelmingly
so
especially
at
17
a
4
pack
id
buy
it
again
but
ive
had
significantly
better
quads
for
quite
a
bit
less
price
good
really
good
but
not
my
favorite
quad
rich
and
malty
but
more
carbonation
than
i
had
been
hoping
for
perhaps
it
was
my
error
in
not
letting
it
breath
for
a
bit
overall
an
enjoyable
quad
not
as
much
wow
as
rochefort
10
but
more
drinkable
nonetheless
i
personally
did
not
care
for
it
i
am
not
a
fan
of
the
brown
ales
but
it
is
smoother
than
most
of
the
brown
ales
i
have
tried
hints
of
caramel
did
pair
with
my
gingerbread
cookies
i
loved
the
complexity
of
this
beer
this
is
a
beer
that
you
sip
and
savour
truly
excellent
full
bodied
darker
ale
which
will
surprise
your
palate
with
rich
and
malty
flavors
take
a
big
whiff
before
taking
this
one
back
and
enjoy
the
deeper
flavor
of
this
quad
very
good
beer
nice
hint
of
fruity
malt
taste
i
also
should
note
that
my
rating
reflects
my
preference
for
dark
malty
beers
with
minimal
hop
character
three
philosophers
finished
too
hoppy
for
me
to
buy
it
again
i
quite
like
this
not
sure
why
they
felt
the
need
to
blend
in
cherries
would
be
much
better
as
a
stand
alone
quad
make
sure
to
air
it
out
in
a
proper
glass
super
smooth
and
malty
finish
othis
is
not
a
bad
beer
but
i
believe
it
to
be
an
overly
ambitious
one
i
think
perhaps
most
of
all
thats
what
makes
it
unsuccessful
the
quad
style
is
a
monster
of
a
beer
style
built
on
the
legendary
brewing
traditions
of
the
trappists
generally
though
not
as
much
so
in
the
wake
of
the
later
phase
of
this
our
american
craft
beer
revolution
very
few
brewers
even
attempt
to
brew
quadrupels
and
even
fewer
do
so
with
true
success
the
great
ones
generally
come
from
the
trappists
of
belgium
three
philosophers
then
may
very
well
be
an
adequate
or
to
be
more
descriptive
not
a
bad
beer
but
once
again
thats
the
largest
part
of
the
problem
making
a
passable
quad
either
in
the
sense
that
its
just
not
bad
for
beer
or
even
in
the
sense
that
its
just
not
bad
for
a
quad
and
even
tastes
like
one
is
a
lot
like
duplicating
a
famous
painting
sure
you
have
the
skill
but
if
it
is
not
better
than
the
original
or
at
least
equally
good
yet
different
who
gives
a
shit
the
equally
good
yet
different
here
was
supposed
to
be
the
kriek
and
if
it
truly
worked
in
this
beer
id
be
inclined
to
give
it
high
praise
indeed
all
of
the
praise
it
deserves
so
while
points
are
most
assuredly
deserved
here
for
craft
and
a
willingness
to
experiment
what
we
are
left
with
is
a
briny
adequate
beer
with
all
of
the
worst
characteristics
of
the
beer
it
blends
in
with
none
of
the
things
that
render
those
bad
characteristics
complementary
this
is
an
enjoyable
beer
it
has
an
eligant
malt
taste
with
defineable
notes
of
fruit
flavor
a
beer
i
like
to
have
around
4150
some
alcohol
esters
mix
well
with
the
dark
fruit
and
medium
malt
flavors
o
a
bargain
at
a
3
single
plum
pruny
cherryslight
tartness
reminiscent
of
the
tartness
of
a
cranberry
concord
grape
also
prominent
as
well
mild
malty
sweetness
slight
cooked
caramel
notes
along
with
some
hints
of
light
toasted
notes
boozy
notes
present
off
the
grape
flavor
soft
earthy
hoppy
bitterness
balances
the
malt
sweetness
nicely
second
time
ive
had
this
brew
in
10
days
it
just
keeps
getting
better
a
nice
end
of
summer
start
of
fall
beer
i
am
glad
this
is
s
year
around
brew
overall
i
believe
this
is
my
new
favorite
quad
definitely
an
americanized
quad
but
the
complexity
of
this
brew
makes
it
stand
out
and
it
is
downright
tasty
i
drank
the
2014
version
in
2014
for
you
people
in
the
future
reading
this
be
aware
that
this
drink
is
suggested
by
ommegang
to
be
cellared
and
many
people
reviewing
it
are
drinking
cellared
versions
from
years
ago
if
you
want
to
know
what
a
fresh
batch
tastes
like
look
no
further
thats
what
this
review
is
about
cherries
seem
to
add
a
bitter
quality
to
the
quad
which
competes
with
the
other
elements
instead
of
working
with
them
o
a
tasty
elegant
brew
the
age
on
it
perhaps
up
to
two
years
may
have
added
both
smoothness
and
mellow
fruitness
which
is
much
appreciated
mouthfeel
creamy
and
smooth
serving
type
bottle
such
an
enjoyable
beer
i
dont
know
what
they
put
in
there
aside
from
grain
and
alcohol
but
something
about
it
is
like
dark
chocolate
and
cream
and
raspberries
and
everything
thats
meant
to
be
good
about
a
dark
aperitif
beer
this
is
exactly
what
i
am
looking
for
from
a
belgian
quad
and
is
one
of
my
favorites
from
outside
the
trappist
ales
spicy
and
savory
the
750
ml
bottle
goes
down
smooth
the
sweetness
of
the
cherries
really
shines
through
and
the
rich
mouthfeel
leaves
me
satisfied
every
time
i
spring
for
a
bottle
a
bit
on
the
pricey
side
as
i
shelled
out
9
50
for
the
bottle
and
the
bar
i
know
of
with
this
bad
boy
on
tap
charges
6
50
for
an
eight
ounce
glass
its
worth
springing
for
when
im
looking
for
an
excellent
brew
this
is
a
tasty
quad
right
away
i
got
a
bananaesque
aromas
from
the
bottle
malty
noise
with
dark
fruits
in
the
glass
looks
like
a
typical
quad
the
taste
is
dark
fruit
malts
and
cherry
in
the
background
this
is
overall
a
great
beer
not
a
rochefort
10
my
personal
favorite
quad
but
well
worth
a
try
o
a
very
good
beer
nice
balance
of
sweetness
and
bitterness
with
a
full
bodied
mouth
feel
delicious
lighter
than
most
quads
not
overly
boozy
easy
to
drink
good
beer
the
nose
is
citrus
and
dark
fruit
belgian
yeast
and
molasses
a
little
toffee
and
rustic
funk
personally
i
get
raisins
instead
of
cherries
but
could
be
just
my
nose
the
flavor
is
much
more
tart
than
i
anticipated
and
the
kriek
blend
really
is
present
here
more
dark
fruit
plums
grapes
and
moderately
sweet
molasses
this
is
a
great
blend
enjoying
the
sour
element
to
it
the
only
negative
for
me
is
the
over
carbonation
great
beer
just
less
fizz
this
is
a
great
quad
for
an
american
brewery
its
up
to
the
standards
of
any
belgian
ale
but
with
a
little
bit
of
uniqueness
of
american
style
ive
tried
the
sampler
which
as
three
different
years
with
the
oldest
being
the
2010
if
i
remember
right
saving
that
for
a
special
occasion
very
good
very
strong
onot
one
of
my
preferred
styles
as
it
is
a
bit
too
sweet
for
me
with
a
boozy
punch
the
sweetness
lingers
which
makes
it
less
drinkable
for
my
tastes
3
75
this
beer
pours
a
nice
dark
brown
it
has
a
strong
presence
and
a
nice
full
body
its
flavours
are
of
molasses
and
toffee
but
it
also
carries
a
strong
sweet
flavor
like
a
belgian
it
is
full
bodied
but
well
rounded
and
is
easy
to
drink
considering
its
strength
overall
it
is
another
strong
offering
from
ommegang
but
not
my
favorite
great
flavors
one
you
will
want
to
sip
and
enjoy
from
a
bottle
into
a
pint
glass
consumed
8232014
overall
a
fine
brew
that
is
to
me
misplaced
in
category
i
should
rereview
an
older
bottle
in
the
future
might
be
too
fresh
to
enjoy
thoroughly
right
now
the
brew
stands
out
like
a
high
alcohol
dubbel
or
bsda
for
a
quad
it
falls
short
this
bottle
lacks
complexity
and
depth
the
flavors
seem
to
be
muddled
together
so
nothing
really
stands
out
and
says
excellence
like
i
said
before
its
a
fresher
review
but
it
still
feels
like
im
drinking
a
higher
gravity
version
of
their
abbey
dubbel
still
this
is
worth
a
shot
sorry
but
this
is
not
a
quad
aged
this
bottle
for
about
6
months
a
dark
brownamber
almost
the
color
of
weak
black
coffee
with
a
thin
white
head
smell
is
of
dried
fruit
molasses
and
yeast
the
taste
adds
another
dimension
to
the
nose
with
some
belgian
spice
brown
sugar
and
more
dried
fruit
full
bodied
smooth
fairly
low
carbonation
but
easy
drinking
with
a
definite
alcohol
presence
overall
a
solid
quad
i
gave
this
beer
an
excellent
rating
but
i
only
drink
it
with
dessert
on
its
own
its
good
but
ommegang
not
the
biggest
fan
has
created
the
near
perfect
dessert
beer
for
a
bunch
of
reasons
it
just
goes
really
well
with
eating
sweets
nice
ambertoffee
color
decent
cream
colored
head
smell
is
bready
yeasty
a
little
overripe
fruit
and
spices
taste
is
nice
but
not
overwhelming
some
figpear
fruits
but
caramel
malts
and
belgian
yeast
spices
are
more
pronounced
this
also
has
a
green
hop
flavor
that
i
find
a
bit
unusual
for
the
style
it
provides
a
little
sharpness
and
i
think
this
could
be
smoother
overall
very
solid
but
it
didnt
meet
my
fairly
high
expectations
overall
another
enjoyable
quad
from
ommegang
overall
this
is
a
tasty
luscious
quad
that
affords
all
the
dark
malty
complexity
one
would
expect
of
the
style
pours
a
dark
hazel
with
a
tan
head
that
laces
the
glass
the
smell
is
very
boozy
with
a
hint
of
cherries
on
the
end
of
the
nose
the
taste
was
really
nice
with
a
lot
of
great
sweet
flavors
off
the
front
with
the
cherries
as
well
as
banana
and
clove
but
with
a
sweet
burn
from
the
alcohol
at
the
end
the
mouthfeel
was
a
little
thick
but
worked
well
in
the
style
would
definitely
recommend
for
those
who
like
stronger
styles
o
this
is
a
fantastic
beer
not
as
outstanding
as
authentic
belgian
quads
such
as
abt
12
and
the
like
but
a
solid
representation
of
the
style
nonetheless
the
added
cherry
dimension
from
the
addition
of
the
liefmans
kriek
really
makes
this
beer
interesting
the
cherry
element
brings
it
all
together
without
being
too
overpowering
im
not
a
big
cherry
person
but
the
amount
of
cherry
flavor
is
perfect
im
probably
crazy
but
this
beer
kinda
reminds
me
of
red
licorice
extremely
drinkable
with
alcohol
that
is
masked
insanely
well
i
could
drink
this
all
day
medium
to
full
body
with
soft
and
abundant
carbonation
really
mellow
after
four
years
of
age
but
with
a
tinge
of
tart
cherry
flavor
alcohol
is
non
existent
i
do
wish
there
was
a
bit
more
of
nose
sometimes
with
ommegang
i
dont
know
what
to
expect
white
the
3
philosophers
i
was
thinking
itd
be
a
bittery
type
of
beer
but
once
i
poured
it
and
saw
a
nice
dark
caramel
color
i
knew
itd
be
different
its
sweet
reminds
me
of
amaretto
while
my
friends
said
it
was
like
so
co
nice
to
drink
of
the
bat
but
gets
heavy
later
on
i
could
see
myself
drinking
this
with
a
dessert
which
i
rarely
do
overall
my
first
from
brewery
ommegang
and
it
did
not
disappoint
whatsoever
i
highly
recommend
three
philosophers
for
those
who
are
already
fans
of
quads
and
for
those
who
would
like
to
get
into
quads
cheers
overall
really
a
delicious
quad
and
a
nice
representative
of
the
style
give
this
one
a
try
notes
just
another
excellent
example
of
what
a
beer
can
and
should
be
12
really
made
a
huge
difference
over
the
fresh
14
id
previously
had
this
beer
definitely
lets
you
know
its
there
a
lot
of
flavors
mixed
in
this
is
my
first
beer
of
this
type
but
still
it
made
a
good
impression
one
thing
for
sure
is
that
this
beer
looks
really
cool
in
the
glass
with
the
gorgeous
ruby
tone
o
wish
there
was
no
coriander
but
i
think
it
is
the
signature
spice
of
the
ommegang
group
o
i
cant
say
i
was
the
biggest
fan
of
this
one
i
finished
the
bottle
which
i
dont
always
do
when
im
not
overly
impressed
so
it
gets
points
for
that
you
could
definitely
tell
it
was
a
combination
of
styles
the
flavors
mixed
together
to
form
something
kind
of
muddy
to
me
the
aroma
and
mouthfeel
were
nice
though
had
from
bottle
into
glass
o
im
not
so
wowed
by
this
beer
the
quality
is
definitely
there
and
it
is
good
but
now
that
ive
had
it
twice
i
probably
wont
ever
get
it
again
o
a
very
complex
quad
with
layers
of
flavors
a
big
beer
that
has
a
lot
to
offer
very
large
head
very
nice
brown
color
sweet
tasting
alcohol
is
very
pronounced
at
first
taste
i
thought
it
was
really
good
but
as
i
drank
more
i
found
i
wasnt
too
crazy
for
the
sweetness
i
didnt
care
for
aftertaste
i
think
this
is
too
sweet
for
me
m
too
much
carbonation
for
me
and
kinda
dry
feeling
overall
i
have
had
several
beers
from
ommegarg
the
last
the
game
of
thrones
fire
and
blood
which
earned
my
trust
from
this
company
at
9
7
abv
its
a
winner
a
nice
brew
to
share
with
friends
o
though
i
mention
the
alcohol
presence
quite
a
bit
in
this
review
it
really
isnt
so
detrimental
since
that
2
blend
of
lambic
ups
the
sweetness
which
rounds
everything
out
a
great
quad
from
a
great
brewery
had
very
high
expectations
for
this
one
need
to
try
some
other
versions
of
the
style
then
try
again
j
hazy
orangebrown
pour
with
a
medium
beige
head
settling
to
a
nice
creamy
coating
enticing
complex
aromas
of
candied
cherries
brown
sugar
raisins
a
little
citrus
and
yeast
less
cherry
notes
in
the
flavor
but
some
nice
dark
fruit
along
with
light
citrus
a
bit
light
for
a
quad
with
a
subtle
sourness
and
a
very
dry
finish
very
nice
and
a
bit
different
for
the
style
42014
almost
4
years
later
i
tried
this
beer
again
i
was
out
to
dinner
and
the
beer
choices
were
limited
went
perfectly
with
the
stuffed
bacon
wrapped
dates
scallops
and
drunken
goat
cheese
ravioli
palates
do
change
will
have
to
keep
this
one
in
mind
next
time
i
am
planning
a
special
meal
taste
is
much
like
the
smell
very
rich
with
an
upfront
caramel
note
the
aftertaste
houses
a
lambic
or
saison
hint
not
overpowering
the
perfect
blend
very
smooth
on
the
tongue
all
and
all
an
incredible
beer
overall
solid
american
quad
with
lovely
fruit
notes
o
its
a
fantastic
big
belgian
beer
o
like
i
said
nothing
that
wowed
me
but
still
a
very
very
good
beer
i
love
ommegang
and
this
one
holds
up
to
the
name
a
great
and
refreshing
beer
and
definitely
worth
a
try
overall
this
is
a
good
example
of
the
style
but
falls
just
short
of
the
other
classics
of
the
style
notes
complex
to
say
the
least
each
sip
gives
me
something
new
the
alcohol
is
very
present
in
this
one
oddly
wineesque
much
more
so
than
other
quads
ive
had
this
would
be
a
great
dessert
beer
also
it
happened
i
was
sipping
this
while
snacking
on
some
cantaloupe
and
for
some
reason
that
match
up
went
really
well
a
bit
sweeter
and
not
as
bready
or
figtasting
as
many
other
quads
but
still
a
favorite
and
good
go
to
beer
spicy
flavors
and
aromas
and
almost
a
peppery
taste
that
is
appealing
medium
bodied
which
makes
it
go
down
way
too
fast
that
and
fact
that
it
belies
its
high
abv
always
satisfying
and
tasty
probably
my
favorite
from
ommegang
this
one
had
a
bit
of
everything
hints
of
lemony
citrus
with
huge
cinnamon
grahm
cracker
notes
lot
of
raisin
and
hints
of
coa
coa
just
thick
enough
and
not
too
bubbly
wow
complex
and
very
drinkable
but
not
as
drinkable
as
a
rochefort
10
and
less
abv
still
amazing
beer
need
to
rereview
this
as
circumstances
cut
this
review
short
o
outstanding
beer
on
all
fronts
great
flavor
body
and
character
o
excellent
beer
and
hope
to
have
again
taste
and
mouthfeel
are
more
important
than
smell
when
it
comes
to
beer
so
im
giving
this
one
just
below
a
4
5
overall
id
probably
put
it
at
85
for
style
16e
specialty
and
85
to
taste
very
nice
beer
that
starts
off
excellent
and
seems
to
get
better
and
better
after
its
had
a
little
time
to
settle
and
open
up
its
smooth
well
balanced
and
bursting
with
flavour
an
incredible
beer
great
quadrupel
very
dark
and
sweet
overall
solid
good
beer
that
has
slight
inclinations
toward
being
a
really
good
beer
the
cherries
really
go
a
long
way
to
smoothing
this
beer
out
not
the
biggest
fan
of
the
style
but
this
is
fairly
faithful
to
it
definitely
worth
a
try
but
this
is
probably
not
a
repurchase
750ml
bottle
into
tulip
glass
being
a
fan
of
anything
belgian
i
was
excited
when
a
friend
brought
this
over
first
thing
i
thought
of
the
flavor
was
that
it
tasted
like
a
mix
of
cigar
smoke
and
burnt
wood
chips
the
kind
hamsters
shit
on
color
to
match
a
great
beer
that
i
would
drink
again
but
only
with
help
as
a
full
pint
of
this
is
too
much
for
me
i
need
a
bottle
all
to
myself
ive
had
this
a
few
times
and
loved
it
this
one
was
poured
from
a
750ml
corked
bottle
into
a
duvel
tulip
glass
aggressive
pour
yielded
a
thick
foamy
head
that
dissipated
slowly
fruity
spicy
aroma
with
a
very
dark
reddish
color
taste
is
very
complex
that
leaves
a
tingly
mouthfeel
good
carbonation
without
a
serious
bite
these
guys
specialize
in
belgian
ales
and
it
shows
who
knew
americans
from
new
york
could
pull
it
off
so
well
according
to
the
label
theyre
part
of
the
duvel
family
of
beers
ah
it
makes
sense
now
if
you
like
the
abbey
ale
style
as
i
do
youll
love
the
ommegang
offerings
cheers
opinion
i
felt
this
was
a
fantastic
drink
but
beers
like
this
dont
quench
a
beer
thirst
these
are
a
one
and
done
type
of
beer
ive
had
other
beers
with
higher
abv
that
hid
it
better
dont
mistake
what
i
am
saying
it
really
is
a
fantastic
drink
very
complex
and
i
would
probably
buy
this
again
my
wife
loved
it
she
was
of
the
opinion
that
it
would
be
better
if
served
at
room
temperature
instead
of
cold
as
we
had
it
she
felt
the
flavors
really
came
out
more
as
it
warmed
in
your
mouth
and
i
cant
disagree
overall
an
amazing
beer
with
a
lot
of
sweetness
from
the
malt
and
fruit
notes
but
so
well
balanced
that
its
not
cloying
despite
the
high
abv
and
the
fact
that
it
is
a
bit
strong
its
surprisingly
easy
to
drink
havent
had
one
of
these
in
a
few
years
and
this
has
been
in
the
cellar
fit
over
a
year
really
solid
for
the
style
with
a
few
more
years
age
on
it
it
could
be
pretty
on
par
with
westy
12
pours
out
to
a
thick
buff
head
and
deep
amber
color
lacing
is
minimal
aroma
is
sour
cherries
with
a
bit
of
aged
hops
sugar
spice
and
bubblegum
flavor
is
complex
and
deceptively
easy
to
drink
there
is
a
good
dose
of
sweet
and
sour
berries
bubble
gum
and
other
fruityspicy
esters
mouthfeel
is
medium
and
sugary
overall
an
exceptionally
tasty
and
enjoyable
beverage
well
for
my
first
review
and
first
time
trying
it
todaytonight
i
must
say
its
one
of
a
kind
and
intriguing
i
have
added
it
to
my
list
of
favorites
in
beer
not
only
does
it
have
a
smooth
yet
bold
taste
is
has
a
very
intriguing
aroma
to
compliment
it
as
well
cheers
overy
good
quad
very
smooth
and
lots
of
complex
flavors
overall
this
beer
provides
a
very
enjoyable
drinking
experience
with
the
deep
malt
and
big
belgium
flavor
the
finish
was
very
nice
with
the
addition
of
the
cherries
and
their
provided
tartness
in
contrast
to
the
belgian
sweetness
t
very
malty
strong
heavy
bodied
cherries
are
definitely
strong
on
the
pallet
has
a
strong
malt
presence
to
it
as
well
overall
it
isnt
a
bad
quad
o
definitely
recommended
i
liked
this
beer
a

o
very
flavorful
and
enjoyable
split
this
bomber
with
my
wife
and
we
both
enjoyed
it
we
had
it
after
dinner
i
would
probably
recommend
that
you
drink
it
before
dinner
so
that
you
fully
enjoy
all
of
the
rich
characteristics
and
subtle
flavors
o
outstanding
beer
the
beers
individual
performance
in
each
category
of
evaluation
belie
how
good
it
really
is
overall
furthermore
as
a
hybrid
it
has
done
a
great
job
of
taking
all
the
great
aspects
of
its
parts
and
saved
only
those
for
this
a
truly
enjoyable
beer
but
at
an
abv
near
10
this
makes
for
a
short
but
lively
and
enjoyable
session
sweet
but
not
overwhelmingly
so
i
struggle
to
find
a
major
flaw
pleasant
aroma
solid
flavor
yet
it
falls
just
short
of
being
a
world
class
effort
mouthfeel
full
bodied
with
small
bubbles
that
completely
coat
the
palate
4
5
overall
very
nice
quad
have
had
better
but
this
is
up
there
as
one
of
the
best
easy
to
find
and
solid
beer
i
should
grab
this
more
often
worth
a
try
for
sure
overall
4

excellent
beer
that
old
chestnut
about
the
whole
being
greater
than
the
sum
of
the
parts
comes
to
mind
and
is
certainly
applicable
here
especially
since
it
was
uttered
by
one
of
the
worlds
greatest
philosophers
there
are
remarkable
aspects
of
taste
and
other
levels
of
enjoyment
in
this
beer
that
would
not
be
found
in
the
individual
beers
of
which
it
consists
i
would
recommend
it
but
with
a
warning
its
high
abv
will
knock
you
on
your
nates
great
and
unique
belgian
quad
will
find
again
worth
seeking
out
o
primarily
a
big
flavor
dark
ale
with
only
some
hints
of
the
kriek
while
this
isnt
my
favorite
style
of
beer
i
can
certainly
appreciate
its
complexity
and
vibrant
array
of
flavors
i
should
have
aged
this
a
few
years
to
cut
down
on
the
hot
boozy
flavors
o
overall
a
good
beer
it
needs
some
aging
to
tone
down
the
alcohol
a
bit
in
my
opinion
and
to
bring
more
its
flavor
had
a
bottle
at
1410
bier
haus
in
calgary
the
sort
of
beer
youll
pay
a
premium
for
if
ordered
out
but
worth
it
in
this
case
looks
like
murky
hazy
root
beer
with
a
little
cream
mixed
into
it
with
ample
brown
foam
aroma
a
sweet
and
heady
mixture
of
rich
toffee
floral
tobacco

low
to

a
very
nice
quad
with
a

found
the

to
be
sweeter

the

poured
a
rich

with
a
one
fingeroff
white
head
that
receded
leaving
a

some

also

very
good
for
sipping
though
almost
smooth
enough
to
gulp
excellent
feel
overall
this
is
an
excellent
belgian
quad
the
usual
flavors
are
there
and
the
addition
of
cherries
during
fermentation
add
a
nice
tartness
in
the
back
of
the
aroma
and
flavor
that
is
quite
pleasant
its
a
very
good
beer
that
is
rich
warming
and
complex
this
is
one
to
go
out
for
o
yeah
a
very
nice
beer
cant
saw
quads
are
my
favorite
style
but
this
one
is
quite
nice
a
great
beer
to
pair
with
the
right
food
very
nice
beer
these
quads
have
really
grown
on
me
and
this
one
is
great
overall
a
great
sipping
brew
to
really
enjoy
i
kinda
wish
i
had
a
fireplace
to
sit
by
a
wedge
of
cherrychocolate
cake
a
big
dog
a
smoking
jacket
this
brew
makes
me
feel
more
important
than
i
am
like
a
good
ale
it
greatly
improves
as
it
warms
great
job
on
a
very
complex
drink
o
a
decent
impersonation
of
a
belgian
quad
but
i
find
this
beer
just
lacks
a
little
something
on
the
flavor
spectrum
quads
tend
to
be
among
my
favorite
beers
and
i
had
expected
a
lot
from
this
one
but
in
the
end
it
just
sort
of
left
me
feeling
a
little
flat
not
my
favorite
quad
but
its
good
to
know
that
i
can
swing
by
any
decent
beer
store
at
any
time
to
grab
some
when
im
craving
the
style
its
a
solid
brew
with
enough
going
for
it
that
i
revisit
periodically
o
a
sipping
beer
really
more
for
sharing
with
a
friend
than
finishing
alone
and
best
when
paired
with
a
strongflavored
side
ghirardelli
intense
dark
chocolate
worked
for
me
the
next
bottle
will
come
out
when
we
have
friends
over
for
dessert
the
three
philosophers
was
a
great
looking
beer
as
well
as
great
tasting
with
big
malts
and
little
to
no
hop
bitterness
i
didnt
pick
up
any
huge
cherry
flavor
only
a
slight
tartness
on
the
end
that
gave
this
brew
a
nice
complexity
along
with
the
belgian
yeasts
and
sweet
malt
its
a
great
gateway
beer
for
someone
unfamiliar
with
a
belgian
style
or
a
stronger
style
of
beer
as
the
cherry
lambic
helps
to
mellow
out
the
belgian
quadrupel

point
oh
scale
not
going
to

i
was
expecting
a
lot
from
this
beer
when
i
purchased
it
however
it
was
still
one
of
the
better
beers
i
have
tried
recently
the
pour
presented
a
dark

with
a

i

i

made
in
the
quad
style
although
not
on

with
some
of
the
best
belgian
quads
o
a
complex
but
well
balanced
beer
with
many
unique
and
potent
flavors
i
will
be
drinking
this
again
o
outstanding

lots
of
cherry

dark

flavors
reddish
tint

the

i

how
good
this
beer
was
a
fanstastic
and
easily
abtainable

gotta
pick
this
up
more
often
this
is
my
current
favorite
beer
i
have
not

a
better
beer
in
my
30
years
of
life
if
you
have
any
suggestions
please
let
me
know
i
welcome
a
challenger
but
as
of
my
100
or
so
beers
this
is
my
go
to
deliciousness
its
strong
but
not
too
alcohol
tasting
its
fruity
and
dark
just
everything
ive
dreamed
of
a
beer
why
is
this
not
replacing
water
overall
an
excellent
example
of
a
strong
dark
ale
there
are
no
qualities
that
make
it
a
true
standout
in
my
opinion
but
this
is
a
big
beer
style
and
with
every
beer
in
this
category
making
quite
the
statement
its
difficult
to
outshine
the
others
absent
of
faults
and
even
the
characteristics
that
i
was
expecting
to
find
but
didnt
arent
musts
for
the
style
definitely
delicious
always
a
good
choice
overall
im
generally
a
west
coast
style
ipa
kind
of
guy
love
the
whole
hoppy
citruisy
bomb
type
beers
stone
ipa
green
flash
west
coast
ipa
ballast
points
sculpin
ipa
but
for
what
this
beer
is
i
really
enjoyed
it
has
those
dark
fruits
which
im
not
a
fan
of
but
they
are
very
mild
and
enjoyable
and
that
little
bit
of
spiciness
you
get
that
dies
out
quick
and
just
leaves
you
with
cherries
for
9
7abv
this
is
dangerous
and
delicious
i
enjoyed
this
this
beer
is
fantastic
similar
in
certain
flavors
and
balance
to
their
abbey
ale
as
others
have
said
very
similar
to
trappists
style
ales
ive
had
definitely
has
a
slight
cherry
flavor
in
the
finish
giving
nice
balance
to
the
sharp
beginning
awesome
beer
this
big
belgian
style
ale
has
to
be
one
of
my
favorite
a
rich
hearty
beefy
beer
with
complex
caramel
overtones
not
to
bitter
with
a
touch
of
sweet
cherry
in
the
finish
the
large
corked
bottle
is
perfect
to
preserve
it
so
that
it
does
not
have
to
be
drank
in
one
sitting
open
top
fermented
provides
a
complex
yeast
blend
if
only
it
were
a
little
less
expensive
at
the
local
pub
but
hats
off
to
this
american
interpretation
to
this
belgian
masterpiece
the
filet
mignon
of
belgian
beers
o
i
find
this
a
pretty
good
tasting
brew
lots
of
flavor
easy
on
the
nose
very
good
mouthfeel
that
makes
it
pretty
easy
to
drink
i
will
buy
this
one
again
at
some
point
even
tho
it
is
not
my
normal
style
o
not
a
bad
brew
but
not
one
id
buy
again
who
knows
maybe
the
single
i
bought
wasnt
the
freshest
i
enjoyed
drinking
it
but
i
was
a
bit
disappointed
as
it
usually
gets
outstanding
reviews
quad
fans
will
probably
like
this
beer
but
i
feel
there
are
better
examples
of
belgian
ales
othis
is
a
pretty
good
beer
just
not
a
great
one
i
thought
it
was
a
bit
overlyspiced
and
carried
too
much
light
fruit
and
bitterness
to
compare
against
the
belgians
i
could
have
used
more
raisinplumfigprune
on
the
plus
side
the
alcohol
is
nicely
concealed
and
if
youre
into
spices
there
are
a
plenty
here
o
deeeelish
a
beautiful
round
beer
great
belgian
flavors
with
a
big
malt
profile
and
the
subtle
cherry
and
fruit
adds
a
nice
complexity
o
ommegang
is
a
good
thing
my
quadrupel
experience
is
very
limited
so
its
hard
for
me
to
place
an
accurate
tostyle
number
on
this
thing
but
its
good
the
cherry
kriek
addition
supposedly
only
accounts
for
2
of
the
brew
but
it
is
present
you
can
taste
dark
cherries
in
there
and
it
mixes
just
fine
with
the
darkfruityyeasty
taste
of
the
quad
a
very
well
done
quad
very
inviting
nose
and
the
taste
is
quite
enjoyable
though
i
felt
that
the
individual
characteristics
in
the
taste
werent
quite
as
distinct
as
in
the
aroma
overall
i
thought
this
was
a
pretty
good
beer
and
a
good
example
of
a
quad
even
though
its
a
blend
of
a
quad
and
a
kriek
i
thought
this
beer
was
much
more
quad
like
with
kriek
aspects
showing
up
in
the
background
and
blending
well
with
the
quad
like
flavors
i
would
be
able
to
tell
there
was
at
least
some
cherries
in
this
beer
by
the
aroma
but
i
dont
think
i
could
tell
that
this
was
blended
with
a
kriek
by
the
flavors
alone
this
beer
had
pretty
good
drinkability
it
was
slightly
warming
but
i
thought
it
was
pretty
smooth
and
the
flavors
did
a
good
job
at
holding
my
attention
i
wouldnt
rule
out
drinking
a
couple
of
these
if
i
was
in
the
mood
for
this
kind
of
beer
what
i
like
the
most
about
this
beer
was
the
balance
im
not
sure
how
this
beer
would
be
if
the
kriek
was
the
dominant
aspect
but
i
dont
think
i
would
enjoy
as
much
since
i
liked
the
quad
flavors
taking
the
lead
with
the
kriek
aspects
showing
up
in
the
background
what
i
liked
the
least
about
this
beer
was
nothing
but
i
do
think
that
cherries
could
have
shown
up
just
a
little
more
in
the
taste
i
would
buy
this
beer
again
it
was
a
little
expensive
but
i
could
see
myself
buying
a
bottle
or
two
once
in
a
while
and
i
would
recommend
this
to
anyone
who
likes
quads
all
in
all
i
was
happy
with
this
beer
i
enjoyed
it
just
the
way
it
was
and
i
now
see
why
this
beer
is
as
popular
as
it
is
i
dont
know
what
took
me
so
long
to
try
it
but
im
glad
i
did
good
job
guys
this
is
a
nice
take
on
a
quard
and
i
think
blending
is
something
that
is
very
under
utilized
by
american
brewerys
keep
up
the
good
work
guys
so
far
this
is
my
favorite
beer
from
brewery
ommegang
and
even
through
this
was
a
blend
i
still
think
its
one
of
better
quads
i
have
tried
nice
blend
and
an
excellent
quad
overall
o
one
of
a
kind
a
very
complex
beer
i
really
enjoyed
this
belgian
quadrupel
i
recommend
pairing
with
something
sharp
dessert
cheese
or
dark
chocolate
i
highly
recommend
this
beer
so
complex
that
it
is
hard
for
me
to
capture
its
essence
in
my
review
great
beer
reviewed
101007
overall
i
like
this
creation
even
more
that
many
belgian
counterparts
its
the
mouthfeel
that
really
makes
that
happen
for
meas
a
contrast
to
the
syrupy
cordial
character
that
can
make
these
beers
intriguing
but
tiring
to
try
to
consume
id
drink
this
one
too
long
for
my
health
especially
on
a
chilly
evening
o
overall
a
very
nice
creation
for
the
ethanol
content
as
well
as
the
true
richness
of
its
flavor
components
this
is
an
incredibly
drinkable
beer
and
surprisingly
somewhat
refreshing
as
well
not
insanely
filling
as
many
beers
with
similar
flavor
profiles
can
be
and
also
does
not
scream
winter
warming
seasonal
brew
this
can
shine
on
its
own
but
wonderfully
also
accompany
food
as
well
definitely
worth
a
try
i
will
absolutely
have
this
again
o
great
beer
everything
you
want
in
a
nice
quad
and
dangerously
uberdrinkable
great
price
point
nicely
done
o
grew
on
me
more
and
more
throughout
well
balanced
beer
my
first
ommegang
and
it
wont
be
my
last
my
favorite
quad
that
ive
tried
so
far
tastes
great
swirl
in
your
mouth
for
awhile
and
youll
see
what
i
mean
i
get
some
coffee
and
malt
well
balanced
smells
like
almonds
champagneand
coffee
if
that
makes
sense
having
it
with
some
gouda
cheesealso
a
great
pairing
just
taste
this
beer
and
youll
be
hooked
salud
overall
i
was
very
impressed
with
this
one
taste
was
well
balanced
and
overall
a
wellexecuted
beer
bit
unique
for
the
style
this
was
my
first
beer
from
the
ommegang
brewery
and
i
will
definitely
try
some
others
o
overall
i
thought
this
was
a
fantastic
beer
that
i
would
recommend
its
more
than
worth
drinking
and
is
a
headtohead
competitor
with
the
best
authentic
belgian
quads
not
your
average
quad
the
cherry
addition
lightens
up
a
usually
heavy
style
but
the
base
beer
is
still
complex
with
yeast
esters
sweet
dry
tart
a
little
bit
for
everyone
i
do
prefer
my
quads
with
more
malt
sweetness
though
rjt
o
very
very
good
solid
tasty
complex
knocked
down
a
hair
for
the
appearance
flaw
o
i
was
pretty
disappointed
in
this
i
had
it
a
year
or
so
ago
and
loved
it
but
i
was
put
off
by
the
gingerbread
that
dominated
ill
have
to
give
this
another
go
because
it
appears
well
made
and
complex
but
it
just
didnt
mix
right
for
me
compared
to
other
quads
82
o
excellent
beer
complex
spicy
with
tons
of
dark
flavors
just
like
a
quad
should
be
not
quite
as
good
as
some
of
the
belgian
big
boys
but
the
best
quad
ive
had
from
america
to
date
three
philosophers
is
an
enjoyable
easy
drinking
quad
that
really
comes
alive
as
it
warms
the
beer
of
the
working
class
o
complex
to
say
the
least
difficult
to
describe
but
the
many
flavors
present
all
complement
each
other
and
balance
into
a
well
rounded
brew
poured
a
tan
thin
persistent
head
from
a
12
oz
bottle
deep
cloudy
red
amber
hue
it
has
smell
of
prunes
some
etoh
and
yeast
apparent
tasted
some
sour
blunted
cherry
flavor
that
lingers
with
some
warm
tartness
slight
malt
it
had
a
warming
effect
with
moderate
carbonation
overall
pleasing
but
strong
beer
on
the
palate
lingering
sour
and
etoh
o
a
great
beer
thats
enjoyable
and
complex
i
enjoyed
it
more
than
most
belgians
on
first
taste
the
toasted
flavor
comes
shining
through
especially
in
the
foam
then
followed
by
the
bold
notes
of
coffee
and
caramel
chocolate
low
carbonation
medium
sweet
and
medium
viscosity
very
very
slight
bitterness
the
taste
centers
on
the
middle
of
the
tongue
aftertaste
of
caramel
very
little
bitterness
overall
been
a
while
since
i
enjoyed
one
of
these
forgot
how
great
this
is
great
brew
one
of
ommegangs
more
wellknown
brews
its
elegant
but
a
bit
overstated
at
times
very
boozy
especially
as
it
warms
a
prime
candidate
for
aging
id
think
remarks
didnt
score
a
s
t
m
at
that
time
please
disregard
those
scores
all
in
all
a
pretty
good
ale
one
id
probably
try
again
after
i
get
some
more
tasting
experience
overall
i
loved
this
beer
its
become
my
favorite
american
quad
as
well
as
one
of
my
favorite
beers
period
simply
outstanding
three
philosophers
pours
a
mahogany
red
color
deep
and
luscious
with
four
fingers
of
foam
that
really
last
off
the
nose
is
grass
and
a
subtle
sweetness
cherry
complex
excellent
retention
and
lacing
the
first
sip
has
no
alcohol
taste
a
little
spice
and
a
bit
of
warmth
creamy
and
balanced
the
body
is
perfectly
carbonated
and
soft
medium
body
the
cherry
from
the
kriek
is
exquisitely
stated
little
bit
of
a
dry
finish
to
remind
you
that
the
hops
are
in
there
this
beer
is
truly
cordial
ommegang
is
near
perfect
as
usual
overall
this
is
a
very
balanced
beer
though
the
lingering
aftertaste
is
not
as
good
as
it
could
be
serving
type

poured
from
corked
and
caged
bottle
into
a
chalice
deep

a

that
isnt

smell
is
belgian

smooth

some
chocolate
and
a
hint
of
fruits
mostly
dark
although
theres
some
cherry
taste
is
just
as
complex
as
the
nose
sweet
malt
up
front
with
the
standard
belgian
yeast
flavor
hiding
in
the
wings
it
fades
into
sweet
chocolate
and
a
bit
of
sweet
dark
fruit
mouthfeel
is
full
and
creamy
this
is
the
first
belgian
beer
ive
been
able
to
stomach
let
alone
enjoy
and
i
love
this
stuff
overall
im
really
impressed
with
this
beer
ive
loved
everything
ive
had
from
ommegang
and
this
beer
did
not
disappoint
it
fully
deserves
its
reputation
only
knock
against
the
beer
is
the
lack
of
a
distinct
finish
has
so
much
distinct
aroma
and
a
wonderful
feel
up
front
that
i
wanted
more
from
the
back
end
of
the
taste
a
bit
of
cherry
malt
sugary
sweetness
date
or
prune
and
a
touch
more
cherry
can
all
be
found
on
the
tongue
a
bit
tart
and
a
touch
of
fig
comes
near
the
end
overall
its
very
good
and
with
some
minor
tweaks
to
the
flavor
and
feel
it
could
be
great
overall
well
crafted
ale
that
makes
a
perfect
after
dinner
digestive
the
rest
delicious
a
bomber
of
this
is
the
perfect
evening
companion
to
relax
and
enjoy
life
o
a
solid
beer
overall
but
perhaps
a
bit
too
sweet
for
my
tastes
the
sweetness
makes
drinking
a
second
glass
a
little
tougher
than
id
prefer
pairing
this
beer
with
something
slightly
bitter
would
be
really
nice
i
feel
like
this
beer
would
age
nicely
after
a
few
years
o
very
very
impressive
smooth
for
a
nearly
10
abv
beer
this
is
a
fresh
quad
i
have
two
saved
for
aging
in
the
cellar
this
is
truly
among
the
best
beers
i
have
ever
had
its
not
the
most
incredibly
complex
but
there
are
some
subtleties
and
absolutely
every
flavor
is
complementary
clean
and
lovely
there
isnt
a
single
aspect
of
this
beer
that
i
can
criticize
negatively
overall
a
wonderful
beer
that
certainly
stands
up
to
its
elder
belgian
siblings
overall
this
is
a
great
beer
definitely
one
to
try
ommegang
rarely
does
wrong
o
fantastic
aroma
i
expected
a
little
bit
more
sweetness
the
the
flavor
and
a
little
less
carbonation
to
ease
the
alcohol
nice
evening
sipping
beer
worthy
of
a
try
i
had
this
with
other
quads
its
better
than
chimay
but
not
as
good
as
rochefort
nor
st
bernardus
its
well
crafted
though
and
definitely
stands
up
with
the
belgian
quads
o
this
blended
beer
is
an
interesting
creation
and
worth
seeking
out
poured
from
a
brown
12
oz
bottle
has
a
brownish
color
with
amber
highlights
and
a
12
inch
head
smell
is
lots
of
dark
fruits
some
mild
spices
taste
is
not
as
good
as
the
smell
malts
dark
fruits
alcohol
is
making
itself
known
here
pretty
good
but
expecting
better
feels
full
bodied
in
the
mouth
and
overall
is
a
solid
beer
pricy
beer
but
worth
it
if
youre
hunting
for
something
complex
layered
and
unique
ive
never
had
a
beer
like
this
one
it
has
its
flaws
but
it
is
a
must
try
for
any
fans
of
the
style
overall
pretty
delicious
beer
overall
i
think
there
are
some
lacking
elements
to
this
beer
but
nothing
that
is
boldly
wrong
with
it
a
bit
on
the
pricey
side
but
worth
at
least
a
try
omy
new
favorite
belgian
quad
it
beats
out
boulevards
imo
overall
my
first
quad
so
i
dont
anything
to
compare
it
too
but
if
they
are
all
like
this
im
in
for
a
treat
i
hope
to
delve
more
into
this
style
in
the
future
but
with
summer
fast
approaching
ill
probably
go
with
lighter
styles
for
the
time
being
a
good
brew
to
curl
up
with
in
the
winter
definitely
a
winner
an
a
beer
i
return
to
quite
often
good
bit
of
clovemalt
nice
caramel
appearance
and
taste
smells
and
tastes
like
i
would
expect
a
strong
belgian
would
taste
bit
of
boozy
taste
but
not
overpowering
esp
for
a
high
gravity
at
9
8
smooth
on
the
way
down
with
a
bit
of
aftertaste
very
enjoyable
experience
and
thats
not
just
because
its
my
second
belgian
of
the
night
other
one
was
unibroue
maudite
if
i
had
a
gun
to
my
head
i
would
go
with
the
maudite
but
it
would
have
to
be
a
big
gun
o
overall
better
than
chimay
and
abt
12
but
it
isnt
a
rochefort
12
id
have
again
savor
from
a
snifter
so
if
you
are
not
a
fan
of
heavily
hopped
beers
and
ipas
then
this
is
a
great
choice
this
baby
can
replace
a
bottle
of
red
wine
easy
i
served
this
at
a
dinner
party
with
wine
drinkers
and
after
a
few
minutes
of
complaining
they
all
went
for
it
and
really
enjoyed
the
meal
it
was
a
steak
meal
its
amazing
how
complex
and
satisfying
this
beer
is
the
2
cherry
blends
so
well
that
it
gives
you
the
best
of
a
red
wine
and
a
strong
beer
this
is
now
my
favorite
beer
for
a
red
meat
meal
i
only
wish
they
vamped
it
up
to
wine
strength
this
isnt
a
criticism
only
a
celebration
of
seeing
beer
find
its
rightful
place
with
a
tasty
meal
taste
starts
out
with
some
instant
sweetness
the
candied
sugar
is
the
star
some
subtle
flavors
meld
in
such
as
some
dark
fruit
like
raisins
and
some
lighter
fruit
like
banana
none
is
overpowering
but
tend
to
work
together
to
paint
an
overall
picture
carbonation
is
a
touch
high
but
gives
it
a
more
refreshing
aspect
than
what
might
normally
be
too
sticky
or
cloying
strength
is
very
well
hidden
with
only
the
slightest
of
afterburn
in
the
back
of
the
throat
overallthis
beer
is
making
me
look
forward
to
trying
others
of
this
type
i
love
the
sweet
and
sour
mix
in
this
price
for
this
is
reasonable
i
would
like
to
try
the
12oz
bottles
next
time
seems
the
better
deal
4
this
beer
has
a
great
dark
amber
color
sweet
fruity
aroma
with
hints
of
banana
sweet
toasted
caramel
tastealmost
a
bit
burnt
spicy
also
strong
flavors
and
mild
to
moderate
carbonation
the
9
8
alcohol
level
really
hits
you
great
complexity
and
a
strong
beer
intriguing
full
of
character
but
not
one
for
sipping
more
than
a
small
glass
at
a
time
this
probably
would
be
better
with
a
boldflavored
snack
from
the
750
ml
bottle
bought
at
litickers
in
san
diego
o
this
was
an
easy
drinking
brew
with
a
nice
mouthfeel
and
really
nice
malt
presence
im
a
bit
of
a
neophyte
for
this
style
but
overall
this
was
solid
ive
got
an
extra
bottle
im
planning
to
age
for
a
year
to
see
how
it
ages
i
just
dont
think
i
am
a
fan
of
belgian
beers
i
can
appreciate
that
this
was
a
good
representation
of
the
style
but
the
smell
and
taste
are
just
not
for
me
i
got
a
very
yeasty
and
breadlike
smell
the
taste
had
these
same
components
but
also
a
sour
fruitlike
taste
i
think
this
is
what
exactly
what
they
were
going
for
but
like
i
said
i
just
dont
enjoy
this
style
i
shared
a
bomber
of
this
with
my
brother
in
law
and
i
am
glad
i
did
he
likes
this
type
of
beer
so
he
got
to
enjoy
it
and
i
didnt
have
to
go
through
an
entire
bomber
of
this
by
myself
o
not
quite
the
authentic
belgian
quads
but
a
stellar
effort
from
an
american
brewer
o
really
nice
but
for
10
i
expect
no
less
dont
drink
crappy
beer
life
is
too
short
overall
i
think
the
price
keeps
me
coming
back
to
this
beer
a
comparable
belgian
costs
about
50
percent
more
in
my
area
i
had
this
when
it
first
came
out
and
liked
it
but
i
was
concerned
it
might
not
be
so
good
after
sitting
in
my
cabinet
for
over
a
year
it
held
up
really
well
i
dont
recall
all
the
characteristics
of
it
when
i
first
had
it
but
i
feel
like
it
is
more
complex
and
subtle
than
i
remember
o
i
think
the
combination
with
the
kriek
is
very
interesting
it
adds
tang
to
what
would
be
a
powerfully
sweet
beer
reedit
50
minutes
into
this
beer
its
fully
opened
up
im
upping
the
overall
taste
categories
but
note
it
takes
at
last
half
an
hour
for
this
brew
even
in
a
big
chalice
to
fully
open
and
start
to
resemble
the
qualities
of
the
above
mentioned
brews
o
sweet
and
dark
fruit
not
my
favorite
right
now
o
of
course
ommegang
lives
up
to
its
name
ive
never
been
disappointed
by
an
ommegang
beer
and
probably
never
will
although
i
got
the
beer
for
a
good
deal
it
is
generally
expensive
but
it
its
well
worth
it
wonderful
taste
very
rich
and
robust
very
delicious
basically
a
dessert
rather
than
a
beverage
at
least
once
everyone
should
make
the
effort
to
try
this
o
age
has
done
this
beer
well
i
got
no
boozy
taste
whatsoever
and
the
yeast
brought
out
some
nice
spiciness
particularly
in
the
aftertaste
this
is
the
best
american
quad
ive
ever
had
but
i
dont
think
thats
as
good
of
a
compliment
as
most
would
the
first
thing
that
hits
the
nose
is
a
mix
of
the
sweet
organic
cherries
found
in
the
aroma
and
a
bitter
earthy
hop
note
with
a
touch
of
alcohol
this
mellows
into
a
very
smooth
bready
malt
taste
that
gradually
caresses
the
tongue
until
finishing
with
a
subdued
belgian
yeast
note
with
some
of
the
downplayed
banana
mentioned
earlier
carbonation
is
medium
to
low
though
the
high
point
of
the
mouthfeel
is
the
gradual
way
in
which
the
brew
continually
reveals
itself
as
opposed
to
the
typically
discrete
tripartite
view
of
front
middle
finish
overall
a
very
nice
quad
and
a
great
goto
beer
if
you
want
something
a
little
sweeter
than
st
bernardus
abt
12
for
a
readily
accessible
quad
however
this
booze
did
linger
and
even
though
i
couldnt
feel
the
warmth
from
this
i
could
certainly
notice
the
alcohol
by
the
time
i
finished
the
bottle
off
its
here
but
the
way
this
was
crafted
relegated
the
strength
of
this
brew
as
an
afterthought
once
the
serving
was
over
with
its
a
testament
to
this
beer
that
the
teeth
behind
it
didnt
come
out
from
the
onset
even
though
its
crafted
here
in
the
u
s
a
you
wouldnt
know
it
unless
the
bottle
was
in
front
of
you
this
was
solid
from
start
to
finish
and
worth
getting
your
hands
on
if
you
have
two
hours
on
your
hands
to
enjoy
all
that
this
has
to
offer
overall
one
of
the
best
american
quads
ive
had
doesnt
quite
reach
the
level
of
some
of
the
authentic
belgian
offerings
but
its
not
too
far
behind
definitely
worth
picking
up
a
bottle
odnot
bad
the
subtle
cherry
nuance
is
actually
pretty
cool
id
rather
have
that
as
opposed
to
a
coughsyrup
cherry
overload
its
a
pleasant
take
on
the
quad
probably
wont
be
running
back
for
more
anytime
soon
overall
another
one
of
ommegangs
great
brews
i
dont
think
i
have
ever
had
one
i
didnt
like
this
particular
brew
is
a
little
heartier
than
my
usual
preference
but
nonetheless
if
i
had
to
choose
a
full
bodied
brew
of
this
style
id
pick
this
one
fuller
body
decent
carbonation
sticky
and
heavy
on
the
tongue
rich
boozy
and
a
bit
cumbersome
the
love
for
this
beer
has
always
been
a
little
difficult
for
me
to
understand
o
i
thoroughly
enjoyed
this
quad
it
is
sweet
malty
and
delicious
very
smooth
and
tasty
give
it
a
try
if
you
get
a
chance
o
this
was
a
very
drinkable
quad
bottom
line
not
a
fan
from
a
750
ml
bottle
this
poured
a
deep
dark
brown
amber
it
has
a
weight
in
the
mouth
and
a
smooth
feel
the
touch
of
cherry
flavor
from
the
added
liefmans
kriek
is
in
my
opinion
just
about
the
perfect
amount
to
add
some
sweetness
to
this
dark
rich
ale
if
you
tend
to
be
disappointed
by
overpowering
fruitforward
beer
yet
feel
like
you
want
some
sweetness
i
would
strongly
recommend
three
philosophers
quads
and
bsdas
are
more
and
more
becoming
one
of
my
favorite
styles
and
in
fact
i
used
to
not
care
for
them
at
all
and
this
one
definitely
stands
out
as
one
of
my
favorites
a
really
solid
quad
with
the
added
awesomeness
of
some
kriek
blended
in
while
a
little
on
the
pricey
side
i
would
still
buy
this
again
o
we
did
the
tasting
blind
but
we
could
totally
tell
which
wasnt
from
belgian
its
very
good
but
next
to
the
other
heavy
weights
it
cant
compare
pours
a
clear
dark
redbrown
body
excellent
two
finger
light
khaki
head
forms
very
dense
and
creamy
in
appearance
a
swirl
produces
some
nice
lacing
and
retention
as
well
as
some
alcohol
legs
aroma
of
cherries
initially
then
comes
a
wave
of
rich
malts
caramel
dark
candied
fruits
toffee
brown
sugar
and
spicy
yeast
a
touch
of
warming
alcohol
on
the
finish
smooth
and
rich
taste
is
ripe
cherries
caramelized
dark
fruits
oak
brown
sugar
and
a
yeasty
finish
incredibly
delicious
and
smooth
with
all
the
right
quad
notes
the
finish
has
a
light
lactic
twang
almost
in
the
form
of
oxidation
but
its
very
pleasant
and
complimentary
mouth
feel
is
creamy
and
medium
bodied
with
the
alcohol
very
well
hidden
overall
this
is
hands
down
the
best
american
made
quad
i
have
personally
tired
it
really
does
compete
with
the
big
belgian
quads
o
im
not
too
enthused
by
this
beer
maybe
quads
just
arent
my
thing
but
there
are
many
a
beer
that
i
would
rather
drink
that
being
said
i
suppose
it
is
pretty
spot
on
for
the
style
i
like
this
brew
its
an
approachable
yet
very
flavorful
quad
i
suppose
its
become
my
go
to
quad
good
stuff
i
was
recommended
this
a
while
back
and
it
ended
up
being
my
first
entry
to
trying
microbrews
amazing
smell
and
first
taste
note
as
with
other
beers
of
this
type
gotta
let
it
temp
up
a
bit
o
i
really
enjoyed
this
quad
as
it
tastes
really
balanced
and
could
pass
for
a
made
in
belgian
beer
it
also
resonably
priced
and
easier
for
me
to
find
living
in
the
north
woods
cheers
flat
and
syrupy
sweet
are
the
lasting
impressions
terrible
outcome
for
such
a
well
flavored
brew
overall
not
as
good
as
i
remember
this
beer
being
when
i
had
it
several
years
ago
it
just
seems
like
the
flavors
dont
meld
well
a
decent
beer
but
i
will
probably
skip
over
it
for
some
belgian
quads
in
the
future
great
quad
the
lambic
addition
gives
a
relative
lightness
at
points
but
at
2
i
is
just
enough
but
it
could
have
used
51
more
it
will
age
amazingly
both
in
the
yeasty
depth
and
lightness
from
the
lambic
good
now
but
great
later
overall
is
just
under
a
4
but
not
quite
worth
it
yet
final
thoughts
a
really
good
quad
from
an
american
brewery
would
i
drink
it
again
yes
if
its
reasonably
priced
o
where
i
am
you
can
usually
get
a
4pack
for
around
15
or
a
bomber
for
around
10
99
so
is
it
worth
it
yes
this
is
one
of
the
best
sipping
beers
you
will
find
great
american
made
quad
would
really
love
more
dark
fruits
big
honey
sweetness
and
belgian
funkiness
the
9
8
abv
could
be
better
disguised
o
i
wouldve
loved
to
see
this
after
3
years
because
im
thinking
i
may
have
been
a
year
late
on
this
but
it
was
still
well
worth
trying
ive
got
my
eye
on
the
2011
next
to
drink
one
and
cellar
the
rest
notes
fruity
boozy
and
sweet
this
is
tasty
but
i
wonder
how
this
would
taste
after
cellaring
for
a
few
years
o
tasty
a
good
blend
of
flavors
that
leaves
some
warmth
in
your
belly
three
philosophers
goes
through
roughly
three
phases
cheery
bread
and
booze
the
boozy
end
might
be
blended
better
but
it
doesnt
detract
enough
to
find
heavy
fault
it
is
9
7
after
all
o
very
good
tasty
quadrupel
and
very
glad
i
got
it
would
definitely
age
one
if
i
could
this
one
was
bottled
6
months
ago
so
i
feel
like
aging
this
would
be
excellent
drink
by
date
is
5
years
later
only
thing
i
could
say
about
this
is
i
would
prefer
slightly
less
carbonation
this
is
my
personal
favorite
quad
pours
dark
brownish
red
with
a
thick
egg
white
head
and
lots
of
lacing
some
quads
are
dry
others
are
sweet
this
one
is
on
the
sweeter
side
due
to
the
cherry
blend
but
dont
mistake
this
for
a
cherry
beer
because
it
is
merely
an
ingredient
and
not
the
focus
the
cherry
flavor
accentuates
the
natural
dried
fruit
flavors
of
the
quad
the
result
is
an
extraordinarily
well
balanced
strongly
flavored
beer
that
is
not
overly
hoppy
or
malty
beer
and
no
hint
of
an
aftertaste
just
beautiful
one
of
the
best
a
real
unique
quad
the
beer
pours
a
hazy
and
pale
red
to
brown
color
with
a
huge
rising
white
head
courtesy
of
the
belgian
yeast
the
nose
is
very
complex
some
chocolate
sour
cherry
funky
yeast
and
spices
i
taste
cherry
first
but
it
isnt
sweet
or
sour
sort
of
neutral
in
terms
of
feel
layered
in
is
cocoa
powder
peppery
yeast
and
some
brown
sugar
lots
going
on
here
and
i
feel
like
this
beer
may
have
changed
a
little
over
the
years
real
bright
mouthfeel
lots
of
bubbles
and
a
surprisingly
dry
finish
for
a
bigger
and
sweeter
beer
the
alcohol
content
is
barely
perceptible
at
all
overall
this
is
much
different
than
most
quads
ive
come
across
and
one
of
the
classic
beers
from
the
state
of
new
york
id
be
happy
to
make
a
night
on
this
really
tasty
and
i
figure
more
out
about
it
each
time
i
enjoy
one
not
to
be
missed
o
i
have
grown
fond
of
brewery
ommegang
and
even
more
so
recently
this
quad
is
a
very
unique
brew
that
screams
complexity
with
the
blending
method
ommegang
uses
three
philosophers
is
unbelievably
unique
with
its
complexity
yet
remaining
wise
with
its
tasty
character
its
a
true
work
of
class
from
a
brewery
who
doesnt
pretend
to
give
you
belgian
style
ales
for
the
fact
that
they
do
give
you
belgian
ales
and
quality
im
definitely
putting
one
of
these
in
the
cellar
as
i
know
for
certain
it
will
sit
nicely
as
time
passes
on
however
i
will
buy
a
few
more
to
enjoy
now
3
philosophers
is
one
of
the
greatest
quads
ever
brewed
and
luckily
the
majority
of
us
can
grab
a
bottle
of
this
overall
this
is
a
nice
beer
i
would
make
this
a
daily
drinker
if
i
won
the
lottery
yumm
yumm
malted
banana
nut
bread
in
a
bottle
this
is
a
very
acceptable
and
drinkable
beer
far
from
excellent
but
very
good
the
first
scents
of
both
banana
and
with
a
nutty
subaroma
make
this
one
intriguing
upon
further
review
as
i
enjoy
this
beer
it
does
hang
in
to
a
nice
flavor
well
worth
giving
a
try
i
have
developed
a
big
soft
spot
for
quads
anyway
so
anytime
i
try
one
this
accomplished
and
up
front
i
just
relax
enjoy
and
dont
overanalyze
the
liefmans
kreik
is
right
there
and
adds
a
bit
of
mystery
to
the
overall
finish
enjoy
this
one
with
a
friend
its
special
different
and
ill
comment
later
on
its
aging
properties
overall
a
great
version
of
a
belgian
quad
i
really
think
the
cherries
add
to
this
beer
and
make
it
a
strong
unique
brew
o
my
favorite
quad
and
one
of
my
overall
favorite
beers
in
general
simply
a
wonderful
way
to
end
a
night
o
there
is
something
sinister
here
though
it
seems
to
be
a
pretty
straight
ahead
take
on
the
style
may
revisit
the
review
after
the
2nd
glass
thick
and
heavy
feel
in
the
glass
and
overall
this
is
a
brew
that
will
fill
you
up
and
feel
good
doing
it
it
definitely
has
the
belgium
tendency
and
the
addition
of
the
kriek
was
a
stroke
of
genius
at
9
8
abv
though
you
should
be
prepared
before
you
pop
the
cork
it
is
a
journey
and
while
you
dont
need
to
drag
it
out
it
is
a
great
brew
to
savor
and
appreciate
overall
a
very
good
beer
i
recommend
getting
some
it
should
be
an
easy
trade
if
you
dont
have
it
in
your
area
overall
this
beer
has
a
flavour
and
feel
like
few
other
beers
it
has
a
unique
taste
it
has
balance
and
it
has
a
high
alcohol
content
all
of
which
are
factors
that
i
enjoy
and
why
it
earns
high
ratings
from
me
i
was
a
little
shocked
though
by
the
sudden
sweetness
and
its
consistently
throughout
if
you
are
looking
for
a
true
taste
of
hops
you
might
have
to
wait
a
while
even
chilled
the
three
philosophers
was
thicker
than
i
remembered
but
it
is
a
brew
to
be
savored
not
slammed
all
in
all
a
really
good
brew
frothy
light
tan
head
over
chestnut
brown
aroma
is
wonderfully
complex
with
dark
fruit
and
a
mild
sour
note
berries
and
alcohol
with
a
deep
pull
flavors
mirror
aromas
sweet
and
tangy
and
sour
nutty
and
bready
malt
is
noticeable
as
well
each
last
sip
is
tangy
stone
fruit
medium
mouthfeel
leaving
a
bit
of
a
sour
residue
on
my
palate
good
carbonation
good
froth
retention
and
good
lacing
its
gorgeous
to
look
at
it
smells
wonderful
and
the
flavors
are
well
balanced
ommegang
does
a
great
job
with
this
style
i
honestly
cant
decide
which
i
like
better
the
2009
has
beautifully
aged
and
mellowed
but
the
bright
fruit
and
cherry
flavors
in
the
2012
are
quite
nice
too
the
scores
are
very
similar
except
the
2009
gets
an
extra
half
point
each
for
the
exquisite
long
lasting
head
and
improvement
in
body
i
will
definitely
age
another
one
of
these
just
to
have
this
debate
again
its
winwin
overall
as
far
as
a
belgian
style
beer
i
would
say
its
pretty
good
smooth
and
drinkable
but
not
my
favorite
beer
certainly
being
a
quadruple
and
9
8
abv
you
should
enjoy
this
over
a
long
time
overall
a
quite
tasty
beer
a
nice
quad
with
all
its
fruit
yeasty
and
boozy
flavor
but
mixed
with
a
nice
but
balanced
cherry
flavor
very
enjoyable
and
drinkable
o
one
of
my
favorite
quads
great
for
taking
the
chill
out
of
a
cool
autumn
night
an
excellent
beer
for
a
cool
autumn
day
rich
flavors
of
caramel
and
toffee
coupled
with
cherries
are
a
fantastic
way
to
keep
my
palate
craving
more
i
will
continue
to
purchase
this
beer
from
time
to
time
and
will
even
age
some
to
see
how
it
changes
o
overall
a
great
beer
which
combines
nicely
two
legendary
belgian
styles
in
a
delicate
and
balanced
way
highly
recommended
o
this
is
hands
down
the
best
american
made
quad
i
have
ever
tired
it
really
does
compete
with
the
big
belgian
quads
and
in
my
opinion
is
right
up
at
the
top
this
beer
is
near
perfect
this
is
my
first
time
trying
three
philosophers
after
passing
over
it
for
several
years
i
like
it
a
lot
for
what
it
is
an
american
take
on
a
quad
with
cherries
it
is
malty
and
even
sugary
without
being
too
sweet
it
treads
that
distinction
with
conviction
ill
be
getting
more
sooner
than
later

i
definitely
love
this

its

and
ill
recommend
it
to
anyone
overall
a
nice

on
the
traditional

style
o
used
a

snifter
closest

to
the
right

something
i
need
to
remedy
this
is
a
very
enjoyable
slow
quaff
but
im
glad
i
took
the
time
to
update
my
had
it
to
a
full
review
because
i
believe
i
was
too
generous
there
isnt
as
much
going
on
here
as
id
expect
it
is
very
good
but
it
isnt
as
complex
as
you
might
expect
from
this
style
id
like
to
try
the
kriek
base
beer
sometime
unfortunately
the
place
i
had
it
at
didnt
have
a
chalice
or
goblet
so
i
was
stuck
using
a
regular
pint
glass
pours
a
dark
reddish
brown
color
with
medium
head
the
aroma
was
nice
but
not
as
good
as
other
quads
ive
had
taste
was
a
sweet
fruityness
with
noticeable
alcohol
and
slight
bitter
finish
overall
a
wonderful
beer
a
good
beer
but
could
use
a
little
more
complexity
pours
a
deep
red
color
with
a
fluffy
white
head
not
much
detectable
aroma
but
some
slight
cherry
on
the
nose
heavy
cherry
flavor
but
not
overly
sweet
which
is
well
done
nothing
really
stands
out
here
but
the
cherry
and
it
is
somewhat
onedimensional
no
spice
or
yeast
as
i
would
expect
from
the
style
excellent
dark
red
color
and
perfect
mouthfeel
slight
alcohol
warmth
good
but
wont
go
out
of
my
way
for
it
doesnt
fit
the
build
of
a
quad
that
i
expect
but
a
very
good
beer

into
my
chimay
chalice
three
philosophers
is
a
deep
cherrybrown
red
color
with
a
milkshake
thick
offwhite
head
the
nose
speaks
of
a
huge
beer
with
a
strong
malty
backbone
with
bits
of
dark
fruit
and
slight
burning
of
alcohol
the
flavor
follows
suit
with
a
very
strong
maltyalcohol
flavor
with
a
backdrop
of
cherry
sweetness
and
tartness
that
finishes
very
dry
mouthfeel
is
full
bodied
with
a
minimal
yet
creamy
carbonation
and
as
previously
stated
has
a
very
dry
finish
overall
another
great
beer
by
ommegang
i
will
intentionally
go
out
of
my
way
for
anything
they
brew
m
medium
leading
to
full
bodied
but
the
carbonation
makes
it
lighters
actually
its
spritzy
oa
nice
quad
with
good
balance
of
flavors
improves
with
warming
o
really
a
fantastic
beer
that
age
has
been
very
kind
to
this
beer
could
definitely
go
much
longer
in
the
cellar
very
rich
and
great
on
a
cold
fall
or
winter
evening
o
not
a
bad
quad
the
cherries
add
some
nice
complexity
without
overpowering
it
has
some
roasty
aspects
even
though
i
dont
think
it
actually
has
any
roasted
malt
chocolate
and
char
and
smoke
in
there
for
sure
though
a
nice
semitart
and
quite
dry
quad
if
thats
you
thing
i
have
to
admit
i
liked
the
beginning
of
the
beer
more
than
the
finish
o
fantastic
beer
i
was
skeptical
to
buy
it
at
first
because
of
the
blend
but
the
kriek
seems
to
be
only
a
slight
addition
of
it
and
it
truly
does
balance
the
beer
out
it
mellows
out
the
booziness
of
the
beer
that
can
sometimes
mask
the
complexity
that
quads
should
and
mostly
do
have
if
you
see
this
beer
pick
it
up
even
if
you
dont
usually
like
the
style
this
one
might
surprise
you
oone
of
the
best
american
quads
i
have
had
not
quite
up
to
belgian
standards
but
hardly
anything
is
a
very
complex
taste
that
deserves
a
seasoned
palate
to
appreciate
pours
a
clear
brown
with
a
foamy
tan
head
that
settles
to
wisps
of
film
on
top
of
the
beer
small
dots
of
lace
form
around
the
glass
on
the
drink
down
smell
is
of
malt
brown
sugar
dark
fruit
and
some
slight
sour
cherry
aromas
taste
is
much
the
same
with
a
slight
roast
flavor
and
an
alcohol
kick
on
the
finish
this
beer
has
a
good
level
of
carbonation
with
a
crisp
mouthfeel
overall
this
is
a
pretty
good
beer
that
is
pretty
tasty
but
fairly
strong
overall
i
am
just
not
toally
sold
on
this
beer
this
particular
bottle
is
around
4
years
old
but
i
still
dont
feel
the
flavor
profile
has
melded
enough
the
cherries
conflict
with
the
lighter
for
the
style
base
beer
malt
bill
and
seems
a
bit
artificial
in
cherry
flavor
almost
medicinal
o
delicious

ale
i
enjoyed
drinking
it
op
uw
gezondheid
3
5
o
nice
to
see
the
difference
between
the
03
and
11
but
i
would
say
this
beer
is
definitely
on
the
downside
cherry
flavor
there
are
notes
of
tart
cherry
raisins
grape
clove
cinnamon
hints
of
ginger
some
threads
of
banana
bread
theres
a
lot
going
on
here
i
dont
know
why
i
never
tried
this
in
the
past
this
is
a
fantastic
belgianstyle
ale
its
a
blend
of
a
quadrupel
and
a
classic
kriek
im
getting
some
more
in
the
future
for
sure
especially
for
only
6
49
the
mouthfeel
is
on
the
heavier
side
and
silky
smooth
carbonation
is
a
little
above
average
overall
its
a
great
version
of
the
style
its
got
a
great
range
of
flavors
and
they
come
together
perfectly
very
drinkable
and
flavorful
and
a
classic
version
of
the
style
o
awesome
awesome
beer
savored
and
enjoyed
every
sip
o
a
great
american
take
on
a
quad
the
best
version
from
over
here
i
have
had
yet
poured
into
a
chalice
pours
dark
reddish
brown
with
a
finger
length
off
white
head
some
tiny
bubbles
can
be
seen
rising
in
the
beer
i
pick
up
the
smell
of
alcohol
cherry
and
sweet
malts
breadiness
is
a
bit
more
prominent
in
the
mouth
that
it
was
in
the
nose
the
cherries
also
come
through
in
the
flavor
pretty
well
and
i
do
taste
the
alcohol
the
beer
is
also
a
bit
tart
which
is
expected
since
this
is
a
blend
of
kriek
and
a
belgian
quadruple
the
body
is
full
with
strong
carbonation
the
alcohol
has
a
nice
warming
feeling
in
the
back
of
the
mouth
its
a
very
pleasant
sipper
this
is
an
excellent
beer
i
would
prefer
a
quadruple
that
is
more
true
to
the
style
but
this
executes
excellently
alabamian
who
is
stoked
about
all
the
new
beers
free
the
hops
is
getting
in
the
state
thanx
guys
serving
type
bottle
i
do
like
wild
and
complex
beers
this
one
meets
that
description
i
thought
the
alcohol
presence
made
itself
a
tad
too
apparent
but
not
enough
to
rate
this
as
anything
less
than
an
exceptional
beer
all
around
a
beer
taste
treat
no
matter
how
you
approach
this
one
mouthfeel
and
drinkability
quite
unpleasant
if
you
ask
me
fizzy
cherries
are
soaked
in
alcohol
and
then
smashed
in
the
mouth
the
alcohol
is
unpleasantly
misbalanced
and
the
aftertaste
is
among
the
worst
ive
encountered
i
wouldnt
call
it
sour
more
funky
and
odd
overall
from
a
dood
who
doesnt
like
quads
much
this
is
an
outstanding
beer
many
of
the
quads
i
have
had
should
be
ashamed
to
be
in
the
same
category
as
this
one
as
this
was
an
excellent
beer
highly
recommended
i
will
buy
and
drink
this
again
and
it
has
a
cool
bottle
o
this
is
a
really
enjoyable
beer
and
was
probably
my
first
introduction
to
the
style
i
still
really
enjoy
the
addition
of
the
cherries
a
wonderful
sipping
beer
but
this
one
will
sneak
up
on
you
o
pretty
complex
but
has
some
flaws
in
the
flavor
overall
very
good
beer
for
late
night
sipping
probably
wont
buy
another
well
maybe
for
cellaring
and
waiting
for
a
special
occasion
poured
from
a
bottle
into
a
chalice
glass
pours
a
deep
burgundy
brown
with
lots
of
large
yeasty
sediment
held
in
suspension
very
dense
looks
great
with
a
big
tan
head
with
medium
lacing
unfortunately
the
appearance
is
the
most
impressive
of
this
beer
the
nose
is
cherry
syrup
and
it
just
eats
up
everything
else
the
yeast
in
the
background
the
malt
all
are
eaten
alive
by
the
cherry
on
this
nose
i
just
couldnt
get
past
it
the
cherry
eases
up
on
the
first
taste
there
is
lots
of
fruit
ester
phenols
and
of
course
cherry
its
very
fizzy
and
very
big
on
the
palate
and
finishes
quite
dry
maybe
some
time
in
the
cellar
would
improve
this
beer
by
mellowing
out
that
cherry
but
as
it
was
it
just
wasnt
for
me
looking
forward
to
trying
this
aged
o
this
is
a
great
sipping
quad
very
warming
and
cozy
perfect
nightcap
the
alcohol
is
warming
but
not
biting
very
drinkable
and
well
worth
seeking
out
based
on
a
recommendation
by
the
beer
guy
i
purchased
a
2011
bottle
poured
to
tulip
the
beer
arrives
a
fairly
clear
dark
amber
with
a
decent
2
finger
offwhite
head
good
retention
and
lacing
a
lot
of
yeast
particles
though
even
after
proper
handling
and
aging
in
the
cellar
the
nose
is
fruity
sweet
with
cherry
as
well
as
hints
of
toffee
caramel
malts
and
plum
character
the
flavor
follows
the
nose
with
caramel
malty
sweetness
that
doesnt
display
the
cherry
flavor
as
indicated
with
the
nose
more
fig
alcohol
warmth
is
noticeable
hints
of
banana
from
the
yeast
full
bodied
and
well
carbonated
but
unremarkable
overall
this
is
very
average
in
my
opinion
nothing
really
remarkable
to
review
and
at
10
i
can
find
better
quads
this
is
fruit
forward
but
everything
really
works
together
to
create
a
well
rounded
quad
love
the
cherry
presence
while
a
green
banana
flavor
really
adds
a
layer
to
the
robust
caramel
malt
this
is
a
brew
on
a
mission
the
brewer
sought
to
create
a
certain
style
and
flavor
and
were
quite
successful
in
that
goal
for
that
a
ill
give
this
beer
a
55
very
tingly
on
the
tongue
medium
bodied
dry
a
little
sticky
on
the
palate
and
lips
this
beer
starts
out
great
every
aspect
would
start
with
a
high
score
but
before
finishing
the
bottle
the
taste
starts
to
build
in
an
uneven
direction
not
quite
sure
how
that
happens
but
ive
consumed
four
bottles
and
it
was
the
same
each
time
i
loved
it
at
the
start
and
was
ready
to
put
it
down
halfway
in
im
a
fan
of
belgian
quadrupels
and
there
are
other
brands
im
going
to
score
next
this
one
just
didnt
do
it
for
me
i
think
im
having
to
downgrade
from
previous
rating
that
one
also
on
tap
at
hobbit
cafe
in
houston
rated
4
75
not
sure
if
it
was
the
varied
context
this
time
that
has
me
enjoying
it
less
than
before
this
time
it
was
preceded
by
the
sour
aphrodite
that
i
liked
so
much
as
well
as
seduction
not
as
much
and
art
of
darkness
i
think
by
the
time
the
three
philosophers
came
to
the
table
my
taste
buds
were
pretty
much
asleep
if
i
can
remember
correctly
and
the
9
8
abv
makes
it
a
challenge
this
is
my
third
time
really
sitting
down
with
a
bottle
of
this
i
really
enjoyed
it
the
first
time
the
second
time
i
thought
it
tasted
like
sugary
blood
according
to
my
notes
and
now
im
just
not
impressed
its
not
a
bad
beer
but
its
too
sugary
for
me
to
really
enjoy
it
it
doesnt
help
that
ive
recently
had
some
great
quads
o
good
i
will
pick
up
another
few
bottles
to
save
and
see
how
the
flavor
changes
i
was
expecting
it
too
be
aged
enough
after
3
years
but
this
was
still
pretty
hot
maybe
in
3
more
years
i
have
a
feeling
they
had
it
in
a
cooler
for
3
years
maybe
a
bit
too
cold
to
age
well
o
cherry
overkill
o
an
incredibly
smooth
quad
that
keeps
me
coming
back
for
more
i
love
the
lambic
aspect
to
put
the
complexity
over
the
top
a
must
try
overall
its
really
not
worth
buying
again
and
kind
of
cloying
not
thats
its
bad
its
just
a
bit
much
original
review
07132010
o
i
liked
this
beer
but
i
think
ill
like
the
cellared
version
even
more
planning
to
crack
the
2008
without
delay
very
drinkable
and
the
taste
of
the
alcohol
is
subdued
just
enough
so
you
know
youre
drinking
something
high
but
it
doesnt
taste
like
straight
ethanol
all
of
the
flavors
have
their
place
delightful
overall
great
beer
closely
resembles
the
trappist
beers
delicious
overall
i
didnt
know
what
to
expect
since
ive
never
had
a
quad
before
this
was
delicious
ill
have
to
poke
around
the
style
a
bit
more
o
hmmm
ive
had
3p
many
times
before
this
one
seemed
to
be
a
lighter
body
not
a
big
bold
quad
pleasant
pineapple
notes
in
the
flavor
might
indicate
brettanomyces
claussini
producing
a
fruity
brett
character
that
is
quite
different
from
the
more
common
brett
somewhat
disappointed
in
this
particular
batch
this
is
a
pretty
solid
quad
all
around
its
flavorful
and
drinkable
i
return
to
it
again
and
again
overall
this
is
a
really
unique
enjoyable
beer
a
great
sipping
beer
and
certainly
would
go
really
well
together
with
food
i
drank
mine
with
lamb
and
potatoes
on
easter
day
the
mouthfeel
is
pretty
spoton
admittedly
the
attenuation
level
is
belgianappropriate
the
body
is
in
the
medium
range
and
lifted
up
by
the
active
carbonation
its
supersweet
but
balanced
a
bit
by
the
yeasts
phenols
and
spice
overall
this
is
an
aboveaverage
quad
a
damn
fine
american
attempt
at
the
style
but
not
a
great
example
compared
to
the
revered
belgian
inspirations
m
quite
drinkable
at
near
10
appropriate
carbonation
decent
brew
for
sure
o
a
nice
example
of
the
style
that
never
quite
reaches
the
greatness
of
its
inspiration
i
had
high
expectations
and
was
not
disappointed
this
is
a
fine
product
and
i
definitely
recommend
it
o
three
philosophers
is
exciting
and
anyone
with
access
owes
themselves
to
at
least
a
single
obviously
youre
probably
not
going
to
drink
the
fourpack
this
is
the
ideal
nightcapper
and
does
what
an
excellent
beer
is
supposed
to
do
make
you
feel
alive
and
aware
compaired
to
other
whites
it
left
a
wonderful
after
taste
that
makes
you
want
more
the
belgians
really
know
their
beer
this
is
one
unique
beer
i
have
never
had
anything
quite
like
it
it
seems
to
combine
the
complex
maltiness
of
a
quad
with
the
tangy
acidity
of
a
kriek
lots
of
the
maltiness
is
lost
but
it
is
still
delicious
i
will
keep
a
couple
bottles
for
a
while
and
see
how
it
ages
my
only
gripe
with
this
stuff
is
the
price
it
must
be
a
difficult
beer
to
make
o
a
fun
beer
to
experience
a
sipping
after
dinner
beer
this
could
really
sneak
up
on
you
otherwise
i
like
having
one
every
once
in
a
while
certainly
a
beer
that
expands
horizons
recommend
o
i
cant
figure
this
one
out
in
some
aspects
its
a
great
beer
but
in
the
aspect
of
simply
sipping
and
enjoying
it
piece
by
piece
it
unfortunately
isnt
theres
just
something
hindering
its
drinkability
still
a
very
nice
drink
though
overall
every
time
i
try
this
beer
i
have
a
different
reaction
the
first
time
it
was
mindblowing
the
second
time
it
was
a
giant
piece
of
crap
this
time
its
solid
its
not
my
favorite
by
any
means
but
the
ability
to
blend
a
medicinal
cherry
flavor
with
a
belgian
ale
is
impressive
considering
the
fact
that
it
never
becomes
exhausting
overall
deeply
flavoured
aromatic
and
full
bodied
quad
that
makes
me
enjoy
every
sip
dont
pass
the
chance
to
pick
this
up
if
its
available
overall
this
beer
is
a
great
dessert
by
itself
very
rich
complex
sweet
and
interesting
ommegang
does
a
great
job
with
this
beer
and
the
nearly
two
years
of
age
have
brought
the
raisiny
sweetness
even
more
to
the
forefront
the
yeasty
spice
is
the
perfect
accent
to
this
sweetness
and
really
helps
this
beer
shine
simply
fantastic
overall
a
rich
malty
treat
a
superb
ale
i
would
recommend
o
top
notch
quad
full
flavoured
hint
of
abv
warmes
the
belly
and
the
cherries
add
a
nice
touch
on
the
finish
i
certainly
wont
make
the
same
mistake
twice
the
quad
part
of
this
very
solid
but
i
would
like
more
of
the
kriek
to
be
blended
in
on
this
one
dark
ruby
red
almost
brown
short
offwhite
head
with
nice
lacing
pale
malts
dark
roasted
rye
malts
brown
sugared
fruits
like
cherries
and
figs
on
the
aroma
the
taste
mimics
the
aroma
quite
well
pale
malts
dark
roasted
rye
spices
sourdough
bread
and
black
cherries
on
the
first
sip
hints
of
chocolate
vanilla
and
orange
rind
follow
the
malty
sweetness
of
the
rest
of
the
body
syrupy
mildly
bitter
tangy
mouthfeel
moderate
to
high
carbonation
with
a
medium
sized
body
beautiful
brew
i
absolutely
love
ommegang
and
everything
they
do
what
i
really
want
is
for
the
tangy
tartness
to
be
lowered
ever
so
slightly
and
everything
comes
together
for
this
one
oi
think
for
how
available
this
beer
is
and
for
what
it
has
to
offer
it
is
pretty
incredible
that
being
said
quads
are
not
really
my
thing
but
i
really
like
the
touch
of
kriek
added
to
it
it
is
an
incredibly
drinkable
beer
for
what
its
worth
and
i
am
not
sure
if
i
would
buy
it
again
but
i
do
think
it
was
worth
trying
i
expected
more
cherry
kriek
happening
but
it
must
have
aged
out
super
fun
beer
to
decipher
but
i
wouldnt
want
more
than
one
and
remember
philosophy
begins
in
wonder
plato
the
beer
is
a
pretty
shade
of
ruby
with
an
inch
of
fizzy
beige
head
a
lot
of
cherries
in
the
aroma
followed
by
belgian
yeast
smells
malty
the
flavor
is
fairly
sweet
with
prominent
cherry
juice
yeast
takes
a
backseat
to
the
sweet
cherry
flavor
booze
emerges
more
as
i
progress
through
the
bottle
overall
a
good
beer
and
one
i
would
have
again
that
said
this
is
best
only
occasionally
and
in
small
doses
cherry
flavor
becomes
a
bit
cloying
midway
through
interesting
and
worth
a
try
o
a
very
good
beer
and
its
amazing
how
well
the
kriek
comes
through
with
only
being
2
of
the
blend
id
like
to
see
how
this
beer
changes
after
a
couple
years
single
finger
head
and
not
much
lacing
on
a
cloudy
amber
with
yellow
hues
body
sweet
and
maple
syrup
like
smell
with
dark
fruit
notes
initially
this
one
is
very
boozy
and
bitter
but
it
mellows
out
some
still
too
boozy
takes
away
from
the
dried
fruit
glavor
in
the
background
medium
body
and
moderate
carbonation
overall
just
too
much
alcohol
taste
overall
a
damn
good
beer
not
a
big
cherry
fan
or
i
would
have
rated
this
a
little
higher
o
one
of
the
best
quads
youll
find
a
fruity
high
grav
belgian
that
is
smooth
enough
at
the
start
for
your
girlfriend
and
bitter
enough
at
the
end
for
your
motherinlaw
o
this
beer
is
great
this
is
one
of
the
best
quads
i
have
ever
had
it
just
has
so
much
flavor
and
looks
amazing
o
a
very
nice
enjoyable
quad
the
kriek
mixes
things
up
a
bit
but
doesnt
overpower
o
i
have
had
this
ale
many
times
before
reviewing
each
time
lends
more
and
more
awareness
complex
and
wild
i
am
sure
to
pick
up
more
flavor
specifics
with
my
next
bottle
a
must
try
poured
a
beautiful
dark
orange
red
color
with
a
voluninous
white
head
typical
quad
scent
with
dark
fruits
and
a
touch
of
dark
cherry
the
taste
followed
the
scent
but
no
cherry
flavor
was
present
the
mouthfeel
was
pleasant
with
a
touch
of
effervescence
not
a
bad
beer
but
there
are
better
quads
out
there
for
sure
i
was
thoroughly
disappointed
with
this
beer
i
expected
something
exceptional
and
got
a
beer
which
is
average
at
best
nothing
about
this
impressed
me
lacked
depth
and
character
not
a
great
beer
at
least
not
yet
ill
save
the
second
bottle
for
a
while
and
see
if
a
little
age
makes
this
a
better
beer
o
this
is
a
serious
beer
and
it
bears
that
weight
literally
and
figuratively
this
is
the
2011
version
and
i
believe
that
ignoring
this
for
several
months
will
yield
rewards
as
the
complex
components
come
together
overall
this
is
an
interesting
and
tasty
beer
one
of
my
first
from
ommegang
follows
the
nose
as
it
starts
off
fairly
sweet
some
slight
alcohol
kicks
in
and
allows
the
raisiny
dark
druits
take
over
fairly
smooth
and
medium
bodied
didnt
taste
any
of
the
cherry
but
it
really
didnt
matter
it
was
great
overall
a
delicious
quad
indeed
i
really
enjoyed
the
mixtures
of
the
different
fruit
flavors
that
balanced
off
with
the
lightbitterness
finish
o
this
is
one
of
the
most
drinkable
quads
ive
had
complex
not
too
thick
or
boozy
and
quite
original
as
well
well
recommended
fantastic
beer
easy
drinking
the
complexity
works
its
like
asian
cooking
a
ton
of
different
flavors
working
together
in
harmony
to
form
one
great
flavor
overall
what
we
enjoyed
most
about
this
brew
was
the
flavoring
the
aroma
sets
things
up
nicely
but
the
tastes
showcased
a
creative
way
to
present
a
quad
the
blend
of
the
malty
base
with
the
sweeter
and
tarter
fruit
was
very
nice
and
unique
for
the
style
o
great
beer
a
good
beer
that
everyone
should
have
at
least
once
o
i
definitely
enjoyed
this
beer
its
very
rare
that
you
can
get
a
mixed
pack
with
such
good
beers
definitely
a
good
offering
from
ommegang
o
awesome
beer
very
complex
and
has
a
ton
of
flavors
to
savor
i
will
look
forward
to
drinking
this
again
o
very
complex
beer
very
unique
loved
it
would
and
will
try
this
one
again
funny
enough
picked
it
up
at
a
world
market
along
with
a
bison
chocolate
stout
would
much
rather
drink
this
beer
though
not
an
everyday
beer
but
definitely
one
to
keep
around
for
the
right
night
by
the
way
this
beer
kicked
my
ass
haha
happy
drinking
osolid
example
of
a
quad
but
not
great
a
little
too
hot
and
a
little
sweet
but
i
did
enjoy
it
the
reveal
ommegang
three
philosophers
would
drink
again
if
i
had
the
chance
thanks
kevin
3
5
overall
classic
belgian
transplant
brewery
that
i
am
thankfull
we
have
in
the
us
obviously
they
know
how
to
nail
a
quad
and
they
did
just
that
one
of
my
favorite
styles
poured
into
my
orval
chalice
half
finger
light
tan
head
that
retreats
faster
then
a
french
regiment
i
kid
lots
of
floaties
opaque
deep
reddish
brown
an
ugly
beer
nice
bready
aroma
i
also
detect
bubblegum
raisin
clove
and
brown
sugar
reminds
be
alot
of
a
dubbel
i
just
brewed
the
cherry
comes
through
nicely
in
the
flavor
but
doesnt
steel
the
show
malty
brown
sugar
and
cooked
fruity
sweetness
lots
of
yeast
charecter
in
the
taste
not
as
smooth
in
flavor
as
i
usually
like
in
a
quad
velvety
mouthfeel
a
little
more
prickly
then
typical
carbonation
like
liquid
candy
great
little
beer
here
glad
i
borrowed
it
o
this
beer
is
solely
responsible
for
my
love
of
belgian
style
beers
it
introduced
me
to
a
style
that
now
represents
a
large
portion
of
my
beer
budget
and
im
just
as
impressed
by
it
today
brown
with
a
reddish
hue
a
fat
white
head
starts
off
that
eventually
reduces
to
the
splattering
across
the
surface
sweet
and
tart
aroma
flavor
has
some
sweetness
sugar
and
dark
fruits
cut
very
nicely
with
a
little
tartness
from
the
cherries
not
sour
though
very
lively
mouth
feel
from
the
carbonation
medium
bodied
i
wasnt
sure
what
i
would
think
of
this
as
quads
can
often
be
a
little
too
sweet
for
me
but
the
presence
of
the
cherries
is
a
great
addition
and
really
cuts
into
the
sweetness
so
it
never
becomes
too
overbearing
for
me
very
nice
take
on
a
quad
o
overall
i
am
really
enjoying
this
quad
it
is
not
at
the
level
of
rochefort
10
but
this
is
very
solid
two
fingers
of
tan
head
rise
and
fall
gracefully
upon
a
reddish
brown
body
head
retention
and
lacing
are
poor
as
luck
would
have
it
the
rest
of
the
beer
is
far
from
poor
big
fruit
aromas
of
cerries
plums
and
raisins
lead
you
to
a
very
well
balanced
malt
presence
with
flavors
of
caramel
and
toffee
and
you
cant
ignore
the
ever
present
warmth
of
alochol
this
is
a
well
balanced
and
very
smooth
drinkin
full
bodied
beer
this
one
is
best
sipped
over
a
period
of
time
highly
recommend
this
one
o
a
favorite
this
review
is
a
fresh
bottle
but
this
beer
ages
magnificently
highly
recommended
and
something
i
come
back
to
often
d
my
first
brew
from
ommegang
and
it
didnt
disappoint
a
bit
timid
but
quite
complex
and
highly
drinkable
especially
considering
the
abv
i
look
forward
to
more
beers
from
ommegang
overall
a
solid
quad
a
style
that
usually
attracts
high
expectations
a
great
winter
experience
doa
o
3
5
o
this
is
by
far
the
best
quad
of
ive
had
in
a
long
time
the
aftertaste
lasts
forever
in
my
mouth
and
makes
me
want
more
notes
why
arent
blends
like
this
done
more
often
an
excellent
quad
ommegang
consistently
proved
to
me
their
ability
to
brew
quality
belgianstyle
ales
that
compare
with
the
best
from
across
the
pond
this
one
is
no
exception
overall
a
perfect
beer
for
a
january
night
in
upstate
ny
overall
incredibly
well
crafted
beer
which
gets
better
and
better
as
you
get
towards
the
end
of
the
glass
it
is
hard
to
rate
this
beer
but
not
hard
to
love
it
i
truly
hope
you
all
enjoy
salud
overall
this
beer
is
a
good
quad
i
know
there
are
others
that
are
better
but
this
one
is
easily
accessible
and
happy
with
me
i
love
the
fact
that
the
beer
can
warm
up
and
still
taste
delicious
and
the
aromas
and
flavors
stand
out
more
than
when
this
review
was
originally
started
hard
to
believe
that
after
close
to
650
beers
i
havent
tried
this
one
but
here
it
goes
pours
a
cloudy
ruby
red
color
nice
thick
head
looks
great
in
the
glass
estery
smell
with
some
dark
fruit
aromas
taste
is
medium
bodied
and
super
complex
it
takes
a
couple
of
sips
and
some
real
patience
to
even
dissect
them
all
prunes
grapes
chocolate
coffee
cherry
all
blended
together
in
a
hearty
tasty
brew
finishes
super
smooth
a
tinge
of
alcohol
a
great
sipping
and
night
cap
beer
will
definitely
try
it
again
in
the
future
worthy
getting
for
sure
o
despite
not
being
made
in
belgium
this
beer
represents
the
accuracy
and
precision
with
which
ommegang
produces
tasty
belgianstyle
ales
three
philosophers
is
better
than
many
belgian
quads
despite
being
usmade
and
it
is
definitely
my
favorite
american
quad
palate
heavy
in
the
mouth
very
strong
yeasty
taste
with
a
little
bit
of
chocolate
and
mostly
fermented
and
fruity
it
is
brewed
with
a
little
bit
of
cherry
and
that
is
definitely
apparent
in
the
aftertaste
not
prominent
but
detectable
this
beer
may
be
my
favorite
quad
i
ever
had
i
have
had
several
bottles
since
my
first
one
and
they
have
such
a
smooth
hint
of
cherry
on
the
back
end
with
no
boozy
taste
that
can
be
found
in
other
quads
as
the
beer
warms
the
flavors
really
start
to
open
up
it
poured
amber
colored
into
a
belgian
tulip
with
a
nice
two
finger
head
first
sip
and
i
knew
i
was
hooked
if
i
ever
win
lotto
this
would
have
a
designated
spot
on
my
shelves
forevermore
o
holy
shit
i
cant
believe
how
well
this
beer
ages
a
fucking
treat
for
sure
almost
five
years
in
the
making
seeing
one
of
my
all
time
favorite
quads
aged
for
almost
five
years
is
completely
mindblowing
age
one
and
see
for
yourself
i
hope
i
dont
offend
too
many
people
with
the
fbombs
this
is
an
absolutely
amazing
revelation
overall
a
great
belgium
style
beer
not
too
shabby
considering
it
is
made
in
the
heart
of
ny
state
overall
perhaps
my
review
is
a
bit
harsh
because
it
tastes
great
american
quads
are
always
missing
just
a
hint
of
something
but
i
love
the
style
so
its
tough
to
criticize
too
much
overall
its
not
one
of
those
everyday
beers
but
one
of
those
every
once
in
a
great
while
i
like
the
tastes
but
the
fruitiness
is
not
something
im
used
to
so
i
have
to
get
used
to
it
but
overall
its
good
and
enjoyable
ive
only
had
a
few
quads
before
im
trying
to
get
into
the
belgian
style
of
beers
most
of
my
focus
has
been
on
american
brews
so
i
decided
to
branch
off
a
little
i
have
to
say
im
impressed
with
this
style
very
complex
and
it
exercised
my
palate
it
made
me
wonder
what
are
all
these
flavors
that
im
indulging
i
have
tried
my
hardest
to
describe
them
since
they
are
so
different
than
the
typical
american
style
beer
although
this
is
brewed
in
america
this
has
a
genuine
belgian
taste
o
overall
a
pretty
nice
quad
its
nice
that
it
is
available
all
over
the
place
and
year
round
though
i
wish
it
was
a
tiny
bit
cheaper
at
first
i
enjoyed
the
taste
much
more
than
the
nose
but
as
it
warmed
up
the
nose
got
significantly
as
more
fruit
and
cherry
came
out
worth
checking
out
and
something
i
would
have
again
may
buy
one
to
age
and
see
what
happens
poured
from
a
750
ml
bottle
2011
version
into
a
ommegang
tulip
i
cant
read
the
bottles
date
this
pours
a
hazy
dark
tea
color
with
a
massive
tan
head
which
doesnt
last
the
smells
are
of
funky
and
sweet
belgian
yeast
esters
a
hint
of
cherries
some
dark
fruit
and
loads
of
malts
the
feel
is
medium
with
tons
of
carbonation
which
give
it
a
tingling
creamy
feeling
the
taste
is
how
it
smells
and
itd
excellent
a
little
dry
but
full
of
sweetness
cherries
and
dark
fruit
and
a
tad
alcohol
burn
very
delicious
beer
just
mouth
full
of
taste
which
other
beers
really
dont
have
this
one
has
a
heck
of
flavor
to
it
taste
is
rich
ripe
fruit
sweet
with
a
mild
bitter
finish
mild
carbonation
very
smooth
i
really
cant
taste
much
cherry
smell
is
really
intense
often
resembling
molasses
chocolate
raisins
and
rum
taste
is
near
perfect
for
a
quad
in
my
opinion
very
rich
cherry
and
belgian
yeasts
some
banana
roasted
caramel
and
oakey
notes
smooth
yet
full
of
lots
of
flavors
and
body
alcohol
is
felt
in
the
mouth
but
not
very
intense
its
rated
very
well
for
a
reason
go
get
one
of
you
havent
had
before
in
fact
go
get
any
ommegang
for
the
most
part
they
all
rock
pours
very
dark
reddish
brown
with
one
fingered
off
white
head
tons
of
stuff
floating
in
it
some
lacing
on
the
glass
smells
of
bananas
and
plums
maybe
a
hint
of
cherry
but
not
real
distinct
taste
is
rich
ripe
fruit
sweet
with
a
mild
bitter
finish
mild
carbonation
very
smooth
i
really
cant
taste
much
cherry
overall
this
is
good
ommegang
seems
to
have
developed
a
hybrid
of
belgian
styles
that
produces
intriguing
results
quite
an
interesting
and
experimental
beer
and
definitely
one
that
is
suitable
for
grand
occasions
budgetwise
although
a
belgian
trappist
could
do
just
has
fine
recommended
a
try
o
good
ale
quad
is
not
my
favorite
style
but
i
certainly
appreciate
the
intricacies
of
this
one
would
recommend
o
overall
another
nice
beer
from
ommegang
its
a
beer
i
would
drink
if
it
were
available
but
wouldnt
be
jumping
over
the
bar
to
get
at
like
a
trappistes
rochefort
dr
extremely
drinkable
very
flavourful
and
pleasant
quite
nice
o
a
musttry
beer
and
i
say
this
even
though
this
beer
is
not
to
my
usual
tastes
the
infusion
of
the
cherry
kriek
adds
a
sourness
and
a
tartness
that
is
at
the
very
edge
of
what
i
will
drink
some
may
find
it
too
fruity
cherry
but
i
think
it
is
a
classy
beer
that
desereves
a
drinking
even
though
it
is
not
my
exact
preference
in
a
beer
every
time
i
have
one
it
doesnt
disappoint
unfortunately
im
not
finding
anything
too
special
about
these
beer
very
medicinal
and
the
minor
cherry
addition
doesnt
do
much
for
it
theres
also
a
bit
of
cloying
sweetness
and
spiciness
after
a
while
tolerable
but
its
there
drinkable
but
id
rather
have
something
else
o
another
holiday
staple
in
my
household
this
is
a
beer
that
i
cherish
sipping
during
the
cold
weather
cheers
overall
a
great
beer
i
have
to
admit
ive
only
had
a
handful
of
quads
but
this
is
right
up
there
for
its
drinkability
i
like
this
beer
but
it
was
not
as
good
as
i
had
hoped
it
would
be
i
was
actually
hoping
for
a
more
pronounced
tart
cherry
flavour
the
cherry
is
clearly
there
but
that
flavour
is
not
unusual
in
the
style
and
doesnt
really
differentiate
this
beer
that
much
good
but
not
a
standout
recommended
i
could
name
a
few
quads
i
like
better
but
three
philosophers
has
a
unique
and
trademark
flavor
it
tastes
distinctly
belgian
but
unlike
many
us
attempts
at
this
style
it
doesnt
just
taste
like
a
quad
and
for
such
a
young
brewery
this
ale
might
as
well
come
from
a
recipe
passed
down
for
200
years
a
great
holiday
sipper
i
rarely
bitch
about
weather
but
its
in
the
freaking
30s
in
san
diego
right
now
this
is
hitting
the
spot
overall
a
style
that
american
breweries
have
trouble
doing
ommegang
does
quite
an
excellent
job
great
brew
this
is
a
dessert
beer
through
and
through
sip
it
enjoy
it
take
your
time
with
it
ommegang
is
full
of
quality
brews
with
a
penchant
for
creative
belgian
goodness
that
said
three
philosophers
is
ommegangs
grand
slam
befitting
for
the
cooperstown
brewery
the
cherries
really
make
this
what
it
is
the
tartness
completes
this
beer
and
makes
it
very
good
this
is
however
far
from
a
st
bernadus
or
rochefort
in
complexity
oa
solid
beer
decent
quad
should
also
try
the
beer
fresh
this
is
a
big
and
powerful
beer
in
all
respects
complex
and
wellmade
shared
the
750
ml
bottle
and
that
was
more
than
enough
for
me
not
exactly
easy
drinking
material
a
slowsipper
to
be
sure
might
just
make
this
a
thanksgiving
tradition
well
at
only
2
of
the
blend
the
cherry
kriek
component
does
well
to
represent
spurring
other
thoughts
of
comparative
low
number
high
value
providers
in
our
cultural
midst
i
only
somewhat
kid
i
sense
here
a
decent
ode
to
a
strong
belgian
dark
ale
but
going
all
upstart
colony
with
the
cherry
juicing
gag
once
past
the
academic
firsties
i
can
say
that
theyve
succeeded
in
their
melange
of
traditional
belgian
flavours
my
oblivious
initial
confusion
slowly
turns
to
gentle
appreciation
anyway
3
philosophers
is
world
class
top
quality
brew
america
has
brewed
its
guiness
o
a
silky
smooth
big
belgian
that
cherry
accent
adds
an
extra
kick
of
sweetness
that
makes
this
almost
wine
like
in
some
ways
but
still
all
brew
so
glad
we
have
a
few
from
this
brewer
in
town
now
o
this
beer
really
grew
on
me
as
i
got
through
it
ill
definitely
be
drinking
this
again
with
some
holiday
meals
pouring
type
bottle
into
chalice
o
this
one
is
pretty
good
im
quite
surprised
i
guess
i
should
revisit
ommegang
overall
this
is
an
excellent
american
made
quad
that
is
well
worth
drinking
great
beer
competes
will
with
the
belgian
and
delivers
a
powerful
and
complex
punch
o
i
love
it
a
great
quad
with
the
addition
of
cherry
the
cherry
is
perfect
not
overt
as
in
many
a
fruit
beer
perfect
harmony
i
am
sold
overall
smooth
warming
a
great
dessert
beer
those
3
philosophers
really
put
their
heads
together
for
this
sublime
taste
o
a
decent
beer
im
not
real
versed
in
quads
but
i
would
probably
buy
this
again
d
its
exciting
and
different
but
far
from
the
best
ive
had
and
it
certainly
doesnt
take
many
of
them
to
feel
it
overall
the
alcohol
was
very
well
hidden
and
the
beer
was
very
drinkable
the
taste
seemed
well
balanced
but
it
didnt
blow
me
away
as
much
as
i
expected
it
to
it
just
seemed
to
be
missing
a
little
something
in
the
taste
and
mouthfeel
department
regardless
its
still
a
very
very
good
beer
havent
had
a
ton
of
quads
but
i
would
say
this
is
better
than
some
of
the
others
ive
had
really
think
they
hit
the
mark
with
the
cherries
nothing
too
much
but
a
nice
complement
to
the
beer
would
love
to
try
an
aged
one
one
of
the
best
american
quads
ive
had
this
remains
largely
faithful
to
its
belgian
counterparts
but
the
addition
of
cherries
is
a
pleasant
tweak
im
curious
if
this
would
indeed
hold
up
until
72016
as
ommegang
suggests
on
the
bottle
o
this
is
an
excellent
style
representation
with
a
new
twist
its
a
go
to
in
the
fridge
and
i
have
several
in
the
cellar
for
years
to
come
overall
a
great
brew
with
plenty
of
complexity
and
one
i
will
always
grab
when
i
can
the
abv
is
well
masked
although
it
comes
through
in
your
head
during
the
second
half
of
the
bottle
o
i
really
enjoyed
the
experience
and
am
now
more
interested
to
try
more
of
this
variety
mouthfeel
is
medium
to
mediumfull
with
that
nice
smooth
carbonation
feel
that
also
leaves
a
little
bite
on
your
tongue
overall
a
good
brew
not
the
best
quad
ive
ever
had
but
still
satisfying
the
cherry
adds
an
interesting
note
to
the
beer
definitely
worth
having
around
medium
mouthfeel
good
carbonation
wellbalanced
brew
that
is
drinkable
i
also
love
the
design
and
name
of
this
one
ill
have
more
of
it
in
the
future
im
sure
recommended
o
this
is
a
very
solid
example
of
a
quad
i
particularly
enjoyed
the
role
of
the
kriek
in
this
one
to
give
it
that
dark
fruit
and
cherry
input
i
will
definitely
revisit
this
when
i
can
get
my
hands
on
it
save
for
an
occasion
with
others
and
spread
the
happiness
of
this
great
beer
d
three
philosophers
is
an
exceptional
beerbelgian
quad
its
easy
to
drink
has
a
complex
flavor
and
is
extremely
enjoyable
great
brew
overall
this
was
a
wonderful
beer
that
you
could
sip
on
for
hours
as
the
flavor
profile
changes
as
the
beer
warms
i
hope
the
flemish
have
found
this
one
o
delicious
complexity
and
a
great
deal
to
boot
let
this
one
heat
up
a
bit
that
is
if
you
can
hold
out
o
i
could
only
wish
i
lived
in
belgium
this
bottle
needs
to
be
shared
with
a
friend
o
super
quad
lots
of
malt
and
yeast
character
overall
for
the
value
minded
ba
this
is
very
close
to
a
rochefort
10
but
at
a
third
of
the
price
i
would
rate
this
very
close
to
rochefort
10
and
st
benardus
of
the
different
quads
i
have
had
this
would
be
my
third
favorite
this
actually
has
a
better
head
and
lacing
than
the
previous
mentioned
beers
the
coloring
is
closer
maybe
a
little
bit
more
aleish
clearer
than
the
those
two
but
it
does
not
have
the
same
depth
of
flavors
as
a
st
benardus
or
rochefort
still
a
great
bang
for
the
buck
o
a
solid
quad
thats
definitely
worth
a
try
overall
a
very
nice
take
on
a
quad
full
flavored
and
well
balanced
pours
a
deep
amber
red
too
brownish
color
with
a
light
tan
head
in
the
aroma
dark
fruit
but
more
cherry
than
anything
in
the
taste
dark
fruit
cherry
and
a
pinch
of
alcohol
a
small
bite
and
medium
bodied
mouthfeel
with
a
dry
dark
fruit
and
sweet
cherry
in
the
aftertaste
very
easy
to
get
lost
in
this
one
sweet
cherry
makes
it
not
as
abrasive
as
some
quads
this
pours
a
hazy
copper
color
with
a
very
small
quick
fading
head
and
plenty
of
carbonation
left
in
the
aged
bottle
smells
of
plums
malts
raisins
and
sugared
molasses
strong
smelling
beer
taste
is
very
nice
up
front
with
a
somewhat
alcoholic
finish
lots
of
dark
berries
and
plums
on
the
palate
with
a
nice
malt
backbone
slow
drinking
beer
but
very
good
tasting
mouthfeel
is
medium
bodied
overall
this
is
a
great
quad
aged
very
nicely
but
think
it
could
go
a
few
more
years
to
mellow
out
further
a
strong
example
of
an
americanbrewed
belgianstyle
quadin
fact
this
does
a
decent
job
of
standing
up
to
its
belgian
counterparts
and
i
cant
think
of
another
american
brewer
that
does
it
better
at
least
not
as
part
of
their
standard
lineup
great
stuff
nice
smooth
body
alcohol
presence
is
light
but
you
can
feel
it
a
really
nice
beer
but
the
bottle
size
and
alcohol
make
this
a
one
off
overall
a
very
interesting
beer
that
im
glad
i
was
finally
able
to
try
very
complex
i
definitely
will
drink
it
again
o
first
quad
really
enjoyed
it
will
have
to
add
this
to
my
shopping
list
4

o
a
very
decent
brew
and
one
that
i
could
see
aging
a
few
tweaks
and
this
could
be
very
tasty
onot
an
outstanding
quad
but
it
is
a
very
good
beer
im
enjoying
this
a
lot
its
a
little
more
cleaned
up
than
many
of
the
belgian
quads
though
maybe
not
as
complex
it
doesnt
have
too
many
negative
qualities
overall
this
is
a
decent
cheaper
alternative
to
many
quads
overall
a
bit
pricey
16
a
4
pack
but
i
like
its
a
decent
quad
with
added
fruitiness
from
the
kriek
poured
into
a
pint
glass
sorry
didnt
have
a
clean
chalice
the
pour
was
dark
amber
almost
red
with
a
creamy
tancolored
twofinger
head
lacing
was
thick
and
clingy
the
nose
was
leaning
heavily
to
the
malt
side
with
some
phenol
notes
detectable
the
taste
included
some
subdued
clove
with
a
touch
of
cherry
not
malty
at
all
as
i
would
have
anticipated
from
the
smell
i
didnt
detect
any
alcohol
in
the
taste
either
it
was
medium
bodied
with
higher
than
average
carbonation
overall
not
as
much
punch
as
i
had
expected
from
a
quad
but
not
bad
poured
this
beer
into
a
tulip
duvel
glass
the
appearance
of
this
beer
is
very
nice
it
looks
like
a
hearty
reddish
brown
with
noticeable
yeast
and
large
bubbles
of
carbonation
the
nose
is
complex
and
changes
as
the
beer
the
warms
it
is
sweet
and
spicy
figs
and
nutmeg
with
the
slightest
bit
of
caramel
the
alcohol
and
bitterness
is
up
front
followed
by
a
balanced
spiciness
definitely
some
ying
and
yang
going
on
here
good
beer
will
drink
a
few
this
winter
overall
tons
of
dark
fruits
caramel
bread
and
toffee
havent
had
many
quads
but
this
is
fantastic
extremely
complex
you
gotta
love
when
the
smell
of
a
beer
is
similar
yet
different
then
the
flavor
this
beer
works
on
all
levels
for
me
o
a
great
beer
for
sure
its
unique
and
unbalanced
different
from
any
other
quad
ive
ever
had
but
quads
are
all
pretty
different
the
mouthfeel
was
medium
bodied
with
a
fine
understated
carbonation
easy
to
drink
not
too
sweet
and
far
from
boozy
o
another
good
brew
from
ommegang
i
have
enjoyed
this
beer
thoroughly
it
is
a
simple
beer
in
some
aspects
but
is
complex
enough
to
capture
your
attention
it
does
not
overwhelm
your
senses
and
pack
quite
a
punch
if
you
are
not
careful
or
if
you
like
it
that
much
it
can
get
you
pretty
tipsy
by
itself
you
can
pair
it
with
a
hearty
meal
or
drink
it
by
itself
i
wasnt
satisfied
for
the
price
and
the
hype
from
the
home
of
the
baseball
hall
of
fame
comes
this
exquisite
and
unique
rendition
of
a
belgian
ale
a
really
caramelsweet
aroma
leads
to
an
extremely
complex
flavor
with
a
full
mouthfeel
and
finishes
in
grand
fashion
careful
though
this
beer
packs
a
punch
to
the
tune
of
9
5
abv
so
definitely
not
for
the
lightweights
o
not
as
boozy
as
i
remember
from
past
experiences
with
fresher
bottles
i
think
the
age
mellowed
this
one
nicely
went
amazingly
well
with
a
steak
from
the
grill
m
full
body
rich
surprising
fine
carbonation
o
this
is
one
of
that
beer
for
me
the
one
that
turned
me
into
a
craft
beer
lover
definitely
one
of
my
favorites
and
i
recommend
it
whenever
someone
asks
whats
a
good
beer
one
of
the
best
quads
ive
ever
had
o
wow
if
god
is
a
beer
drinker
this
would
be
in
both
his
fridge
and
his
cellar
it
would
be
hard
to
improve
on
this
brew
slight
cherry
flavor
large
fizzy
cream
colored
head
which
recedes
quickly
dark
amber
brown
in
color
smells
greatmalty
sweetness
tastes
great
lots
of
delicious
sediment
in
the
bottom
lots
of
lacing
really
smooth
full
bodied
ale
this
one
is
so
complex
i
love
beers
like
this
they
are
hard
to
describe
but
simply
awesome
this
one
is
worth
seeking
out
recommended
music
pairing
jimi
hendrix
band
of
gypsies
id
drink
this
again
but
maybe
ill
wait
a
few
years
pretty
fresh
quad
but
im
stoked
to
see
this
on
the
shelves
in
alberta
overall
medicinal
beers
are
a
bit
rare
in
our
household
and
this
was
balanced
enough
to
be
very
enjoyable
though
the
yeast
seemed
a
bit
much
for
the
malts
t
brown
sugar
fig
raisin
and
a
bit
of
booze
the
mouthfeel
feels
a
bit
thick
but
the
beer
manages
to
come
off
feeling
light
not
sure
how
they
pulled
that
one
off
overall
i
did
not
like
this
beer
when
i
tried
it
fresh
a
few
months
ago
but
this
bottle
i
have
been
sitting
on
for
2
years
has
turned
from
an
overly
sweet
mess
to
an
amazing
beer
o
complex
unique
and
enjoyable

after
encountering

on
several
more

since
my

i
have
raised
some
of
my
scoring
i
find
3p

my

was

an

even
though
now
i
can
appreciate
the
beer
only
slightly
more
cheers
d
its
okay
at
best
due
to
the
alcohol
i
would
never
have
more
than
one
of
these
i
bet
its
good
with
a
cigar
overall
it
is
a
great
beer
i
could
see
myself
buying
this
beer
in
a
store
it
was
very
pleasant
and
satisfying
o
big
flavor
in
a
big
beer
very
enjoyable
brew
would
definitely
drink
again
i
feel
that
the
best
way
to
have
this
beer
is
on
tap
that
being
said
it
is
definitely
advisable
to
sip
this
beer
because
it
is
equally
strong
and
thick
almost
has
that
abbeyale
feel
to
it
with
that
cherry
flavoring
added
in
to
make
it
drinkable
o
have
sat
on
this
for
atleast
6
months
now
i
have
to
run
out
and
find
another
this
beer
pours
a
reddish
brown
color
with
thick
tan
head
the
smell
is
slightly
sweet
dark
fruits
a
hint
of
booze
the
flavor
is
a
little
belgian
yeasty
flavor
followed
by
a
big
dark
fruit
and
alcohol
presence
the
mouhfeel
is
medium
bodied
and
well
carbonated
not
a
stellar
representation
of
the
style
but
a
veery
good
one
none
the
less
much
passed
over
toorarely
purchased
three
philosophers
has
always
been
available
and
now
that
i
know
how
highcaliber
this
is
ill
be
purchasing
more
often
a
fantastic
belgian
dark
that
i
imagine
would
benefit
from
some
cellar
time
a
very
cloud
head
a
nutty
clear
color
almost
clarifying
itself
after
being
poured
a
nice
sweet
olor
with
an
essence
of
a
balance
toast
and
smoked
honey
and
fruity
spectacular
flavor
malty
a
hint
of
oaked
caramel
a
balance
between
light
and
heavy
excellent
mouthfeel
letting
you
know
that
its
balanced
and
you
can
drink
it
without
problems
wonderfull
quadrupel
o
i
really
enjoyed
this
beer
and
feel
it
could
be
outstanding
if
aged
highly
recommended
d
very
tasty
brew
my
opinion
of
ommegang
has
gone
up
immensely
lately
maybe
im
having
most
of
the
hits
but
its
seems
like
everything
the
put
in
a
bottle
is
delicious
this
might
be
my
new
favorite
o
definitely
a
sipper
and
good
with
food
sweetness
and
alcohol
get
pretty
overwhelming
and
need
to
be
cut
but
something
sharp
andor
vinegary
i
was
a
little
annoyed
when
i
looked
at
the
bottle
and
saw
cherries
added
but
i
am
pleasantly
surprised
really
tasty
beer
and
different
from
your
average
belgian
in
a
nice
refreshing
way
o
i
wish
my
palate
were
advanced
enough
to
describe
this
an
amazing
incredibly
balanced
beer
that
has
to
be
tasted
to
be
believed
simply
brilliant
o
a
solid
offering
from
one
of
americas
premier
belgian
style
brewers
the
sourness
from
the
kreik
addition
really
matches
well
and
balances
the
sweetness
of
the
malt
a
solid
yeasty
flavor
a
good
mouthfeel
and
an
excellent
and
complex
scent
make
this
a
reliablely
good
brew
o
a
most
unique
brew
and
something
worth
a
try
not
something
that
i
would
want
all
the
time
but
a
most
delicious
and
unique
treat
o
warming
strong
quad
with
a
hint
of
cherry
im
a
fan
of
quads
krieks
and
sours
so
i
liked
this
addition
overall
a
complex
and
unique
beer
for
sure
this
is
a
slow
sipper
to
be
enjoyed
over
an
extended
period
of
time
i
had
no
problem
finishing
the
bottle
with
two
separate
glass
pours
ommegang
hasnt
disappointed
me
yet
i
really
enjoyed
the
kriek
style
i
had
high
hopes
for
this
beer
but
it
didnt
really
deliver
the
alcohol
needs
to
be
toned
down
a
bit
so
the
cherry
plays
more
of
a
factor
o
a
very
enjoyable
and
unique
version
of
the
style
with
the
addition
of
the
kriek
it
wasnt
as
bold
or
complex
as
the
greatest
of
the
quads
but
i
loved
drinking
this
nonetheless
this
would
age
nicely
and
i
may
have
to
rereview
after
i
sit
on
a
bottle
for
a
couple
years
i
bet
the
alcohol
would
become
more
integrated
and
the
flavors
would
become
deeper
overalli
prefer
this
over
st
bernardus
the
light
tartness
adds
that
extra
ummmphhh
that
i
like
the
lower
carbonation
level
really
lets
the
flavors
shine
as
well
great
beer
the
taste
is
excellent
this
bottle
progressed
very
well
the
sweet
fruit
flavors
especially
cherry
are
still
dominant
but
lacking
their
sharp
edge
the
dark
fruits
and
chocolate
get
their
chance
to
shine
on
the
finish
theres
a
nice
backing
provided
by
the
yeast
the
alcohol
sometimes
present
in
fresher
bottles
has
now
completely
mellowed
this
is
now
a
supereasy
drinker
the
mouthfeel
is
solid
its
lightly
carbonated
and
goes
down
very
smoothly
the
drinkability
offthecharts
this
brew
just
goes
down
so
easily
any
hint
of
alcohol
this
beer
presented
is
completely
gone
making
this
one
very
dangerous
overall
im
very
happy
with
this
beer
its
just
straightup
delicious
overallkind
of
surprising
alcohol
presence
considering
the
strength
of
the
other
flavors
even
when
warmed
up
and
creamy
alcohol
presence
is
strong
i
was
a
bit
dubious
about
the
presence
of
cherries
here
at
first
but
it
is
not
at
all
dominant
and
adds
very
nicely
to
this
beers
complexity
o
well
balanced
malt
sweetness
with
sour
finish
alcohol
is
never
overpowering
but
evident
very
great
quad
overall
a
good
beer
alcohol
is
well
masked
by
the
complexity
of
flavors
this
has
benefited
a
bit
from
aging
of
course
ommegang
knows
that
as
they
have
cave
aged
this
beer
could
age
this
longer
before
cracking
it
open
this
beer
is
quite
impressive
it
has
a
balance
feel
and
flavor
that
are
very
engaging
and
almost
contradictorily
very
comfortable
i
cant
imagine
a
way
they
could
have
brewed
this
quad
differently
that
would
have
improved
the
final
taste
i
think
thats
one
of
the
marks
of
a
really
great
beer
which
this
certainly
is
it
should
not
be
missed
three
philosophers
has
made
me
a
believer
o
to
me
this
is
still
the
bar
standard
for
us
quads
like
the
addition
of
cherry
to
this
as
it
adds
a
fruity
dimension
to
this
thin
taste
besides
cherries
but
the
mouth
does
pick
up
the
beer
good
balance
good
carbonation
refreshes
abv
there
but
alchohol
flavor
not
noticeable
very
good
id
have
this
again
overall
a
very
mellow
belgianstyle
quadrupel
well
developed
in
all
aspects
well
balanced
and
not
overbearing
high
abv
without
the
punch
of
the
taste
very
enjoyable
o
i
think
this
is
just
average
for
a
quad
honestly
theres
nothing
here
o
the
noise
is
disappointing
but
the
flavour
is
excellent
and
will
not
disappoint
o
best
beer
i
have
ever
had
there
is
no
way
that
anyone
could
not
love
this
beer
i
wish
it
was
more
affordable
because
i
would
make
it
my
one
and
only
made
it
4
5
overall
just
because
of
the
price
factor
overall
really
wicked
oustanding
beer
i
need
to
keep
one
of
these
all
times
as
a
special
treat
when
i
want
to
reward
myself
for
good
beer

overall
this
is
a
really
good
beer
and
im
glad
to
have
picked
it
up
i
bet
this
would
only
improve
and
mature
if
cellared
but
its
pretty
darn
good
either
way
i
will
undoubtedly
pick
this
up
again
especially
at
a
decent
price
tag
this
beer
poured
out
as
a
nice
looking
brown
color
with
some
red
highlights
the
head
was
a
bit
foamy
at
first
but
settles
quickly
the
smell
of
the
beer
was
lightly
acidic
but
had
a
sweet
fruity
quality
too
the
the
taste
was
a
little
tart
upfront
but
then
shifted
into
a
yeasty
dark
fruit
sweetness
the
mouthfeel
was
decent
and
and
drinkable
overall
i
would
drink
it
again
especially
now
that
it
comes
in
12oz
bottles
pours
a

with
thick
creamy
white
foam
that
settles
out

with

complex
and

good
use
of
cherries
in
there
but
not

quite

this
isnt
my
favorite
style
but
i
enjoyed
this
one
very
wellbalanced
and
drinkable
in
spite
of
its
noticeable
abv
id
probably
pick
this
up
again
given
the
chance
if
i
were
in
the
mood
for
a
quad
three

belgian
style
blend
2011
at
the
office
in
summit
nj
a
business
trip
has
just
gotten
sweeter
with
the
hint
of
cherry
in
this
cooperstown
ny
brew
i
would
definitely
recommend
this
beer
for
a
lazy
summer
night
it
is
not
on
the
light
side
with
an
excellent
balance
of
strong
flavors
this
brew
has
a
rather
sweet
finish
reminiscent
of
summer
nights
cheers
o
i
hadnt
expected
to
like
this
beer
as
much
as
i
did
i
was
afraid
that
the
cherries
would
be
less
subtle
and
integrated
and
that
the
beers
sweetness
would
be
too
much
the
drinkability
is
high
for
a
beer
of
this
abv
o
a
solid
brew
well
worth
the
4
spent
this
appears
to
be
one
of
their
flagship
beers
so
i
was
perhaps
expecting
a
little
more
intensity
not
that
it
is
by
any
means
an
ordinary
brew
there
is
a
lot
here
to
enjoy
it
just
did
not
wow
me
in
the
way
i
expected
that
being
said
i
would
never
turn
one
down
if
offered
to
me
o
a
very
nice
malty
quad
and
a
solid
choice
for
an
evening
sipper
alcohol
is
well
hidden
would
be
good
to
pair
this
with
some
food
as
its
a
hearty
brew
to
be
sure
overall
this
is
a
great
quad
to
be
enjoyed
very
carefully
after
a
few
you
can
solve
the
worlds
problems
do
this
beer
is
a
wellintentioned
americanbrewed
take
on
the
quadrupel
style
worth
a
comparison
to
the
more
welldistributed
belgian
standards
the
involvement
of
cherries
is
evident
and
does
enhance
the
overall
product
acidity
is
a
factor
and
could
be
less
assertive
while
less
carbonation
would
help
to
make
for
a
smoother
and
more
velvety
texture
forgive
me
if
this
sounds
redundant
this
is
a
copy
of
the
review
i
wrote
for
the
village
west
discount
liquors
newsletter
kansas
city
ks
o
i
was
expecting
this
to
be
sweeter
and
more
distinct
flavors
however
this
wasnt
the
case
in
my
opinion
it
isnt
as
sweet
as
say
rochefort
10
its
a
good
beer
in
the
end
overall
it
was
good
but
not
great
i
have
had
better
quadrupels
from
rochefort
and
better
overall
beers
hopslam
the
taste
was
very
similar
to
the
other
quadrupels
but
not
as
strong
and
not
nearly
as
sweet
and
pleasing
near
the
end
of
the
sip
i
am
going
to
be
trying
th
ommegang
abbey
ale
next
lets
hope
that
one
blows
me
away
overall
drinkability
a
slow
sipping
beer
for
savoring
by
itself
although
i
think
it
would
work
well
with
dessert
interesting
beer
and
worth
trying
out
really
impressed
with
the
appearance
and
smell
but
more
sour
than
i
expected
overall
excellent
rendition
of
a
classic
belgian
style
honestly
i
think
this
is
better
than
rochefort
10
lower
abv
probably
helps
it
not
get
too
boozy
overall
i
am
not
really
that
impressed
by
this
quad
but
its
certainly
a
good
passable
brew
not
for
me
a
really
good
quad
overall
and
well
worth
trying
this
is
a
very
nicely
balanced
brew
the
cherry
flavor
is
minimal
but
in
great
balance
a
very
well
rounded
quad
at
a
decent
price
its
not
mind
blowing
but
it
will
not
be
a
disappointment
at
all
o
to
me
this
is
every
bit
the
little
brother
of
rochefort
10
its
great
but
not
quite
as
thick
not
quite
as
warming
not
quite
as
flavorful
its
more
of
an
everyday
beer
and
im
more
than
ok
with
that
if
i
ever
and
i
mean
ever
find
this
ontap
you
can
be
sure
that
ill
be
at
least
two
or
three
glasses
deep
by
the
end
of
the
night
this
stuff
is
great
o
i
dont
overly
enjoy
this
beer
the
reminders
i
get
of
a
cough
medicine
totally
taint
the
quality
of
this
beer
for
me
i
believe
it
is
a
well
crafted
beer
and
very
respectable
but
i
just
dont
go
crazy
over
the
taste
i
wouldnt
mind
if
i
never
had
this
one
ever
again
this
is
my
second
time
with
it
and
i
remember
not
enjoying
it
very
much
the
first
time
very
nice
quad
perhaps
a
touch
on
the
too
fruity
sideif
i
had
to
pick
something

burgundy
with
a

small
layer
of

bubbles
for

of

nice
beer
i
could
drink
a
lot
of
these
and
find
myself
in
trouble
wow
another
brew
that
i
dont
see
too
often
im
loving
this
lately
anyway
the
brew
pours
a
semi
see
through
mahogany
hue
with
decent
carbonation
that
leaves
behind
a
two
finger
head
that
quickly
recedes
to
a
few
islands
of
froththe
smell
is
aromas
of
whiskeycherriespeated
maltsbrown
sugar
and
alcoholthe
mouthfeel
is
very
smooth
medium
bodied
and
well
carbonated
and
has
tastes
of
whiskey
soaked
cherriesxmas
puddingdark
fruitspeaty
malts
and
finished
with
a
sticky
date
finish
and
overall
a
very
unique
drop
and
very
true
to
style
first
impression
is
a
bit
of
a
letdown
color
is
an
average
brown
with
a
bit
of
amber
tint
small
film
of
head
forms
and
laces
a
bit
smells
fruity
and
sweet
with
a
bit
of
must
has
a
classic
belgian
feel
to
the
nose
palate
is
sweet
and
tart
with
alot
of
different
flavors
meshing
well
cherry
and
spices
from
the
yeast
come
to
the
forefront
and
the
alcohol
is
felt
in
the
finish
medium
bodied
with
a
dry
mouthfeel
very
flavorful
and
quite
drinkable
for
a
beer
of
this
strength
d
very
nice
medlarge
bodied
beer
sip
slow
enjoy
cherry
flavor
to
fullest
o
a
good
quad
that
has
some
great
flavors
of
dark
fruit
the
cherry
comes
through
and
is
balanced
nicely
with
a
slight
spice
o
this
is
a
great
brew
and
for
the
style
and
abv
it
is
remarkably
smooth
solid
beer
overall
a
really
great
beer
this
brew
had
the
pleasure
of
being
my
first
quad
a
few
years
back
always
a
nice
treat
whenever
i
drink
it
d
i
like
this
one
well
this
beer
could
definitely
go
longer
im
only
sad
i
dont
have
a
fresh
one
to
bust
open
compare
but
thats
not
a
very
good
idea
on
a
school
night
sorry
cant
come
in
today
too
much
philosophizing
last
night
hey
that
might
work
excellent
quad
final
thought
this
beer
has
a
nice
abv
great
taste
and
is
very
well
balanced
great
beer
overall
this
version
seems
to
be
more
boozy
than
the
2009
i
say
seems
to
be
because
i
did
not
check
the
notes
from
my
2009
before
i
reviewed
this
2010
and
i
did
the
09
review
several
weeks
ago
one
thing
this
version
shares
with
the
09
is
the
ability
to
improve
as
the
beer
temp
rises
good
stuff
o
quite
nice
very
different
take
on
the
quad
style
but
very
satisfying
and
worthy
of
revisiting
often
ommegang
always
does
well
and
this
is
no
exception
take
note
the
mouthfeel
is
truly
oustanding
and
that
really
helps
the
flavors
come
through
o
a
different
take
on
a
quad
the
cherries
change
the
flavor
profile
but
in
a
good
way
sort
of
a
cross
between
a
belgian
and
a
light
lambicsour
would
be
interesting
to
see
it
with
a
few
more
years
on
it
overall
this
is
the
type
of
beer
that
made
me
fall
in
love
wbeer
its
a
big
beer
an
intense
mouthful
if
youre
looking
for
a
belgian
style
beer
to
try
though
this
is
a
pretty
great
start
one
of
the
better
belgians
that
ive
held
up
to
my
lips
quite
nice
but
yet
to
reach
its
peak
i
like
the
cherry
aged
blend
and
hopefully
that
remains
as
the
rest
of
the
beer
mellows
o
my
first
and
favorite
ommegang
beer
i
had
this
at
easter
with
family
and
some
sliced
manchego
with
fresh
chorizo
just
a
perfect
pairing
that
made
an
exceptional
beer
even
better
a
true
sign
that
america
can
make
quality
belgian
styles
the
beer
pours
a
medium
clear
brown
color
with
a
large
creamcolored
head
the
aroma
is
a
strong
mix
of
belgian
sugar
yeast
and
dark
fruit
the
beer
smells
outstanding
the
flavor
is
more
of
the
same
i
get
a
lot
of
dark
fruit
mainly
cherries
as
well
as
some
yeast
alcohol
and
dark
candy
sugar
very
sweet
and
fruity
tasting
beer
very
well
balanced
and
very
tasty
medium
mouthfeel
and
medium
carbonation
a
great
americanmade
quadruple
pours
a
murky
mahogany
color
moderate
cap
of
khaki
head
sporrty
retention
and
some
lacing
scent
has
strong
notes
of
banana
and
bubblegum
sweet
watery
fruit
brown
sugar
and
fresh
yeasty
bread
moderate
amounts
of
spice
and
peppercorns
taste
leads
with
the
banana
and
bubblegum
but
not
as
strong
as
the
nose
would
dictate
quite
malty
sweet
with
notes
of
brown
sugar
and
carmel
and
fresh
yeasty
bread
light
peppery
spice
watery
fruits
such
as
plum
moderately
bitter
finnish
underneath
the
sweetness
despit
being
medium
bodied
felt
watery
at
times
lingering
sweetness
on
the
palate
a
nice
strong
bold
quad
that
would
probably
age
nicely
d
solid
brew
worth
a
pickup
and
a
revisit
very
interesting
and
complex
overall
this
beer
is
what
is
great
with
beer
blending
the
cherry
taste
may
throw
some
off
but
works
well
in
this
beer
this
is
a
true
dessert
beer
and
i
would
give
this
to
any
fan
of
late
harvest
zinschards
o
overall
a
decent
quada
bit
too
hot
fresh
and
the
yeast
seem
to
dominate
the
flavor
despite
decanting
the
glass
but
one
of
the
cheapest
out
there
and
better
than
many
more
expensive
versions
ive
had
o
not
bad
but
i
feel
like
they
were
going
for
more
than
they
shouldve
been
a
nice
beer
to
try
but
being
a
huge
fan
of
quads
i
was
a
bit
let
down
by
what
this
couldve
been
d
the
flavors
were
nicely
balanced
the
sweetness
combined
well
with
the
slight
tartness
and
its
dangerously
drinkable
for
the
abv
great
brew
overall
overall
this
is
the
best
american
quad
ive
had
yet
far
although
i
wish
it
was
available
sans
cherry
juice
or
with
less
cherry
per
my
preferences
definitely
worth
a
try
or
two
its
its
own
beer
which
is
huge
nice
sipper
o
a
really
solid
quad
especially
if
you
like
cherries
overall
this
beer
actually
exceeded
my
expectations
going
in
i
wasnt
sure
whether
or
not
the
kriek
addition
would
be
to
my
liking
but
it
seems
as
though
the
blend
was
quite
judicious
and
the
unique
quad
character
was
preserved
i
will
definitely
go
back
to
this
one
again
in
the
future
o
three
philosophers
is
an
excellent
attempt
at
the
belgian
quad
a
very
competitive
class
that
includes
the
greats
from
the
trappists
the
abbeys
thanks
to
mr
klain
for
the
export
of
this
from
usa
to
spain
ive
been
trying
my
share
of
quadrupels
from
belgian
while
over
here
and
its
nice
to
see
that
we
have
some
superior
belgian
style
to
look
forward
to
when
i
return
home
in
2013
pours
a
dark
brownish
red
into
my
affligem
chalice
mild
head
certainly
nothing
too
crazy
and
some
mild
lacing
didnt
check
the
glass
for
wetness
so
maybe
i
detracted
from
the
head
others
write
about
or
maybe
the
cork
got
beat
up
on
its
journey
smell
is
what
i
like
about
belgian
quads
brown
sugar
figs
apricot
and
plums
i
suppose
the
alcohol
is
prevalent
in
both
smell
and
taste
tastes
great
some
of
the
belgian
yeast
alcohol
is
prevalent
dark
fruits
and
a
tad
sweet
mouthfeel
is
medium
bodied
and
warming
alcohol
overall
i
would
try
again
and
recommend
to
friends
recommended
for
promotion
and
retention
lots
of
head
action
four
finger
head
that
overtook
the
top
of
the
glass
causing
me
to
take
drastic
measures
to
keep
from
loosing
good
beer
head
is
dense
light
brown
foam
with
moderate
clinging
lace
color
is
a
27
on
the
srm
beer
color
chart
smell
is
crisp
and
has
aromas
of
chocolate
honey
fudge
roasted
coffee
apricot
and
pepper
taste
is
intense
with
flavors
of
caramel
molasses
green
tea
licorice
pepper
and
chives
the
flavor
is
remarkable
and
wonderful
blend
of
melon
green
tea
clover
watermelon
rind
licorice
coco
rye
and
overcooked
lamb
mouthfeel
is
a
great
experience
of
creamy
and
prickly
flow
over
tongue
and
soft
palate
this
is
one
of
my
top
10
great
for
the
price
good
buy
itself
or
with
cheese
and
prime
beef
d
i
keep
finding
new
flavors
with
every
sip
and
the
beer
takes
on
a
completely
new
character
as
it
warms
you
just
want
to
sit
down
and
sip
on
this
all
day
great
atmosphere
nice
appearance
including
a
decent
head
and
some
fair
lacing
nose
is
not
strong
but
a
really
welldone
combination
of
grain
wood
and
cherry
flavor
similarly
is
a
great
combination
of
yeasty
grain
tone
and
a
subtly
sweet
cherry
overall
this
is
a
great
quaff
o
overall
this
is
one
of
the
best
american
quad
that
there
is
imo
it
rivals
the
belgian
quads
that
have
been
around
for
centuries
this
a
total
a
in
my
book
o
more
of
an
after
dinner
beer
for
me
d
strong
alcohol
presence
but
it
is
paired
nicely
with
the
fruity
taste
this
is
my
first
quad
and
i
will
certainly
be
revisiting
the
style
overall
this
is
just
an
excellent
quad
i
really
love
cherries
in
beer
so
that
makes
this
even
more
enjoyable
to
me
i
like
the
label
here
its
classic
and
simple
pours
a
pretty
reddish
amber
color
it
is
somewhat
cloudy
but
that
doesnt
affect
the
overall
experience
for
me
the
head
is
off
white
and
a
little
frothy
the
aroma
is
a
little
bready
and
also
the
cherries
come
through
the
flavor
is
complex
cherry
biscuit
apricot
raisin
and
ripe
fruit
in
the
backend
a
hint
of
of
toffee
the
finish
is
bold
and
lingers
for
a
bit
and
maybe
there
was
just
a
hint
of
strawberry
i
think
this
beer
is
a
classic
and
im
so
proud
it
is
from
ny
i
especially
like
it
when
barrel
aged
in
caves
definitely
worth
trying
maybe
not
my
favorite
of
the
style
but
an
interesting
take
this
was
a
very
tasty
beer
good
balanced
flavor
wouldnt
mind
having
this
again
overall
a
superb
belgian
ale
with
the
sweet
flavors
meeting
the
bitter
ones
very
nicely
with
just
a
hint
of
alcohol
not
one
flavor
in
this
brew
overpowers
another
giving
you
a
tremendous
taste
very
tasty
with
a
definite
but
not
limiting
alcohol
presence
id
prefer
the
flavor
to
be
skewed
just
a
touch
more
to
the
tart
side
but
i
aint
complain
too
loud
the
cpj
very
oakey
with
a
strong
alcoholic
flavor
not
much
fruit
but
very
acidic
i
would
have
liked
some
more
sweetness
for
this
variety
drink
i
enjoyed
this
alot
would
have
it
again
with
some
age
on
it
was
a
quick
drinker
it
was
a
bit
small
but
had
good
balance
and
flavor
d
pretty
tasty
ale
the
abv
makes
it
a
nice
stayhome
on
a
cold
day
type
beer
the
cherry
aftertaste
was
quite
enjoyable
would
drink
again
d
if
it
wasnt
for
the
alcohol
you
could
drink
these
all
night
long
pair
with
pork
dishes
vanilla
ice
cream
or
panna
cotta
good
beer
if
it
wasnt
so
strong
id
drink
it
all
day
d
a
heavy
and
enjoyable
sipper
drinkability
im
sure
that
this
brew
has
a
tremendous
following
a
bit
much
on
the
alcohol
flavoring
for
me
however
not
something
i
would
want
over
and
over
its
definitely
a
sipper
a
little
too
much
of
the
wine
characteristics
for
my
liking
i
want
a
beer
that
leaves
me
wanting
for
another
sip
this
beer
did
not
provide
that
for
me
drinkability
enough
of
this
and
youll
numb
your
gums
not
a
session
beer
by
any
means
but
very
drinkable
for
its
style
pours
a
dark
ruby
brown
colour
with
huge
light
tan
foamy
head
into
a
tulip
lacing
heavy
along
the
glass
nose
is
belgian
yeast
caramel
malts
dark
fruit
figs
plums
light
fruit
grape
pear
buttery
and
phenol
auroma
lingers
taste
follows
the
nose
big
malt
and
yeast
flavours
dark
fruits
provide
some
bitterness
tartness
heavily
bodied
mouthfeel
leaves
a
dry
sensation
big
abv
here
limits
consumption
though
pretty
standard
for
the
style
and
one
would
want
to
enjoy
and
warm
over
a
period
of
time
pours
a
gorgeous
slightly
cloudy
mahoganny
reddishbrown
with
a
buoyant
threefinger
head
that
slowly
dissipates
smell
is
fruity
with
that
typical
belgian
yeasty
aroma
taste
is
a
very
nice
malty
sweetness
with
cherries
and
other
dark
fruit
backed
up
nicely
by
a
bit
of
alcoholic
punch
mouthfeel
is
wellcarbonated
but
smooth
overall
delicious
and
very
drinkable
though
at
9
8
abv
gotta
be
careful
i
may
revisit
this
beer
in
a
year
or
two
as
my
palate
refines
d
not
really
my
type
of
beer
drinkability
definitely
drinkable
especially
if
alone
i
plan
on
pairing
this
with
a
slice
of
sweet
chocolate
cake
in
the
future
just
to
see
what
happens
while
this
isnt
my
favorite
quad
it
is
a
fairly
unique
and
delicious
easily
one
of
the
most
affordable
quads
too
under
10
for
a
750ml
bottle
great
very
drinkable
beer
alcohol
very
well
hidden
loved
it
i
like
this
trappist
style
quad
a
kinda
dark
red
that
filled
my
perfect
pour
glass
with
an
ominous
presence
the
aroma
had
cherry
with
maybe
some
winter
spices
thrown
in
the
taste
extraordinarily
robust
theres
that
cherry
you
can
pick
out
from
all
the
malty
alcohol
the
flavor
borders
on
overbearing
but
becomes
much
more
acceptable
as
it
warms
up
id
say
that
slightly
chilled
is
the
ideal
temperature
to
serve
this
at
the
body
is
thick
but
not
chewy
it
leaves
very
little
tartness
on
the
way
down
id
say
let
it
warm
up
and
this
becomes
a
great
brew
d
the
cherries
was
the
thing
that
made
this
american
quad
great
the
balance
between
sweetness
and
dry
bitterness
was
great
usaually
i
find
the
brett
instantly
but
here
i
had
to
read
the
label
to
understand
that
some
kriekstyle
beer
was
an
ingredient
really
interasting
beer
try
it
simple
and
sweet
quad
with
some
cherry
tartness
and
a
rich
mouthfeel
delicious
though
a
bit
too
sweet
for
my
particularly
tastes
well
balanced
nice
that
the
sweetness
is
modest
boulevard
take
note
this
is
how
to
add
cherries
to
a
quad
bbq
is
a
fail
compared
to
this
lengthy
description
of
the
beer
and
how
to
pour
on
the
bottle
poured
into
my
ommegang
glass
the
beer
has
a
beautiful
dark
brown
color
and
a
two
finger
head
that
gradually
fades
away
plums
figs
cherries
and
alcohol
are
present
in
the
aroma
taste
is
comprised
of
the
dark
fruit
from
the
smell
with
some
raisin
the
cherries
make
a
subtle
appearance
and
they
complement
the
taste
very
well
mouthfeel
is
light
bodied
and
probably
the
weak
point
of
this
beer
drinkability
is
dangerously
high
as
the
abv
is
nearly
hidden
great
beer
poured
into
my
karmeliet
tripel
glass
with
a
2
finger
off
white
head
of
fine
bubbles
that
resides
fairly
quickly
after
a
minute
or
two
when
held
to
the
light
it
is
deeply
red
and
lacing
is
minimal
cherries
and
currants
are
apparent
in
the
nose
with
the
aroma
of
yeast
on
the
back
end
first
sip
begins
tart
but
drops
to
a
sweetness
overall
the
taste
finishes
dry
with
some
heat
on
the
back
end
probably
due
to
the
9
5
alcohol
yeast
makes
the
texture
that
much
better
and
the
tart
dryness
blends
well
with
the
malt
for
being
a
quad
this
beer
is
dangerously
drinkable
and
doesnt
come
off
too
fruity
despite
being
blended
with
cherries
great
beer
overall
d
really
tasty
stuff
a
great
combination
of
warming
alcohol
and
depth
of
flavour
on
a
beer
that
drinks
easy
and
looks
great
very
fine
highquality
thoughtful
complex
beer
lovely
dark
amber
color
but
the
head
was
not
as
creamy
as
i
anticipated
this
may
be
due
to
tap
settings
nevertheless
wonderful
complex
flavor
i
was
afraid
the
belgian
kriek
cherry
lambic
would
be
overpowering
but
it
was
present
with
wonderful
subtlety
i
also
recently
had
an
aged
philosophers
from
2008
on
tap
at
blind
tiger
very
smooth
creamy
subdued
i
enjoyed
this
2011
super
fresh
and
new
version
better
believe
it
or
not
drinkability
some
may
not
like
the
cherry
flavor
but
i
think
its
what
gives
this
excellent
quad
its
edge
very
tasty
and
easy
to
down
a
750
ml
bottle
in
one
sitting
although
at
10
abv
id
probably
stop
my
session
after
one
big
bottle
i
will
definitely
seek
this
one
out
again
this
beer
blew
my
mind
you
better
sip
on
this
one
i
had
pretty
high
expectations
on
this
quadrupel
as
it
is
from
the
ommegang
brewery
which
i
have
heard
and
read
so
much
about
and
this
quadrupel
a
bottle
from
2009
happens
to
be
my
first
beer
from
ommegang
in
general
the
flavors
were
very
good
not
yet
great
but
the
mouthfeel
failed
to
hold
up
effectively
i
am
not
sure
if
the
blame
goes
to
age
though
2009
is
not
exactly
old
will
revisit
with
a
fresh
bottle
when
the
chance
comes
by
d
the
slighty
sour
and
bitter
finish
makes
it
more
difficult
to
enjoy
for
me
it
just
tastes
like
a
belgian
that
has
been
infused
edit
on
21811
original
2211
had
a
couple
more
of
these
and
i
am
even
more
impressed
than
originally
i
am
bumping
my
smell
and
taste
reviews
from
4
0
to
4
5
and
my
drinkability
to
5
0
this
is
definitely
going
to
be
one
of
my
favorites
i
was
actually
saddened
when
i
got
the
bottom
of
my
last
glass
maybe
a
trip
to
the
ny
brewery
is
in
order
an
overall
good
beer
cherry
on
the
nose
dry
finish
but
great
drinkability
a
mild
beer
overall
but
the
more
you
think
about
it
the
more
complex
it
seems
i
could
drink
a
lot
of
this
although
i
prefer
more
of
an
ipa
myself
i
purchased
a
growler
on
a
whim
and
do
not
regret
my
decision
2011
bottle
dark
ruby
color
clear
thick
tan
head
smells
like
toasted
bread
yeast
sweet
fruit
and
a
little
bit
of
the
cherry
taste
is
very
malty
caramel
and
yeast
some
fig
and
raisin
the
fruit
flavor
is
a
cross
between
cherry
and
apple
cider
a
little
bitterness
but
also
pretty
sweet
some
of
the
alcohol
comes
through
as
also
big
body
kind
of
sticky
very
nice
drink
d
while
i
loved
the
layers
of
complexity
that
the
cherry
added
i
think
that
this
beer
would
improve
dramatically
with
a
bit
of
age
on
it
i
think
that
the
sometimes
harshmedicinal
cherry
notes
will
round
out
a
bit
and
push
this
beer
to
greatness
sweet
taste
with
spices
to
be
honest
i
could
not
taste
the
cherries
one
the
many
good
qauds
i
have
tasted
untill
now
poured
from
750ml
bottle
into
heavy
chalice
glass
pours
a
deep
brown
with
garnet
tints
and
a
super
tight
beige
head
aroma
is
loaded
with
fruity
esters
that
fill
the
room
before
the
first
sniffs
even
transpire
plum
prune
dates
raisin
caramel
toasty
sweet
malt
molasses
brown
sugar
and
light
fruity
notes
that
seem
to
proliferate
with
the
accompanying
of
some
mild
alcoholic
warming
notes
fruity
esters
that
showed
up
in
the
aroma
make
a
similar
impression
in
terms
of
the
light
fruit
flavor
profile
dark
fruits
however
take
the
day
with
nearly
every
facet
making
its
respective
way
in
the
swirling
dark
sugar
torrent
that
is
so
prevalent
dark
syrup
like
sugars
are
complemented
nicely
by
a
wholly
evident
alcohol
note
that
warms
the
nasals
but
doesnt
detract
from
the
experience
palate
is
effervescent
with
lots
of
bubbly
prickling
amongst
a
high
viscosity
torrent
mouthfeel
is
thick
and
quite
rich
even
chewy
with
warming
booze
and
an
ever
so
slight
roasty
dryness
this
is
only
very
subtle
though
for
the
overall
theme
of
the
finish
strays
away
from
attenuation
and
presents
itself
with
a
sticky
smacking
fullness
i
was
pleasantly
surprised
by
this
american
example
of
a
style
that
american
brewers
rarely
edge
out
the
belgians
in
d
as
mentioned
three
philosophers
is
a
complex
sippable
brew
that
in
my
opinion
was
a
good
value
for
the
money
and
fine
example
of
a
belgian
style
quad
however
this
one
lacked
just
a
tad
in
the
drinkability
due
to
the
aftertaste
im
glad
i
shared
this
bottle
as
it
is
unlikely
i
could
have
finished
the
full
750ml
without
going
to
another
drink
in
between
i
dont
find
this
beer
to
be
very
drinkable
honestly
it
doesnt
go
down
too
easy
for
me
but
it
is
more
of
a
sipping
beer
to
enjoy
over
the
course
of
an
hour
i
bought
a
4
pack
and
didnt
drink
the
last
beer
until
a
month
and
a
half
later
a
good
beer
to
try
but
i
dont
think
ill
be
buying
it
again
i
really
like
this
beer
but
i
wish
they
would
ramp
down
the
alcohol
just
a
tad
the
alcohol
up
front
really
dominates
the
beer
however
there
are
some
sharp
fruit
flavors
that
is
followed
by
a
smoother
caramel
flavor
but
i
am
still
bothered
by
the
almost
overpowering
booziness
of
the
beer
great
stuff
nonetheless
bottle
poured
into
a
dfh
tulip
glass
a
murky
mahagony
reddish
brown
color
with
a
tight
light
tan
head
an
interesting
aroma
a
mix
between
cherry
fruit
grape
plum
slight
smokiness
alcohol
caramel
and
an
almost
bubblegum
type
note
mediumlight
mouthfeel
wow
this
thing
has
quite
the
boozy
punch
the
booze
really
takes
away
from
the
other
flavors
for
me
but
it
still
is
pretty
nice
sharp
fruit
type
flavors
up
front
followed
by
a
smooth
caramel
flavor
some
roast
type
notes
as
well
hmm
its
flavorful
but
for
me
as
i
said
the
booziness
sort
of
dominates
this
beer
d
outstanding
beer
i
enjoyed
sipping
on
this
one
for
about
an
hour
really
comes
to
life
once
its
warmed
up
a
tad
d
high
thoroughly
enjoy
this
beer
and
would
gladly
quaff
it
all
evening
long
overall
i
enjoyed
this
beer
but
was
not
impressed
as
i
thought
i
would
be
i
enjoyed
hennepin
and
rare
vos
more
but
this
is
still
a
quality
brew
a
very
good
beer
that
i
recommend
not
the
best
of
the
style
but
an
example
to
be
revered
well
done
d
not
only
do
i
know
ive
positively
reviewed
this
before
one
of
the
first
great
beers
i
shared
with
my
dad
before
he
passed
i
remember
it
being
much
much
better
than
this
time
around
a
little
boozy
and
cloyingly
sweet
the
12
oz
bottle
doesnt
seem
to
have
the
same
greatness
the
750
does
overall
this
is
a
nice
complex
yet
pleasant
beer
could
see
this
one
aging
very
well
going
to
have
to
pick
up
another
to
set
aside
d
a
great
drink
but
i
wished
for
more
chocolate
coffe
toffee
tones
allinall
i
will
buy
it
again
and
age
it
i
think
this
beer
will
be
awesome
with
some
age
behind
it
nice
job
ommegang
d
a
touch
boozy
but
very
drinkable
for
a
quad
drinkability
very
smooth
drinking
and
tasty
and
also
very
well
crafted
however
i
dont
really
see
what
the
big
deal
is
its
a
great
beer
but
on
par
with
and
similar
to
other
belgians
i
have
tried
d
for
a
beer
that
is
almost
10
it
goes
down
nice
and
smooth
with
very
little
alcohol
burn
d
something
this
rich
and
complex
is
one
to
savor
poured
from
the
corked
22
into
my
ommegang
glass
it
came
with
the
gift
pack
medium
black
with
some
brown
foam
and
nice
lacing
smell
was
malty
and
roasty
with
the
slightest
hint
of
cherry
taste
was
also
malty
and
roasty
mouthfeel
was
bit
thick
and
drinkability
was
good
the
alcohol
snuck
up
on
me
nighty
night
d
4
this
is
clearly
good
beer
but
some
of
what
these
philosphers
were
trying
to
say
must
have
gone
over
my
poor
head
d
i
tried
this
on
tap
a
few
days
after
being
quite
disappointed
by
a
bottle
serving
i
usually
prefer
the
taste
of
bottleconditioned
beers
being
served
from
the
bottle
but
this
seemed
quite
a
bit
more
appealing
to
me
on
tap
ill
give
the
bottle
a
rereview
some
day
the
draft
serving
lacked
the
carbonation
and
alcohol
burn
that
turned
me
off
from
the
bottled
serving
and
seemed
maltier
which
i
enjoyed
it
seemed
also
to
have
lost
the
slight
cherry
taste
it
had
from
the
bottle
but
this
could
be
due
to
the
bar
serving
it
too
cold
i
tried
to
let
it
warm
up
but
had
a
hard
time
resisting
all
in
all
an
enjoyable
quad
but
unlikely
to
be
a
regular
choice
for
me
d
definite
sipper
but
smooth
and
sweet
slightly
creamy
take
it
slow
and
this
is
a
treat
personally
not
my
style
it
is
a
very
strong
tasting
beer
that
works
well
as
an
apertif
for
after
dinner
i
could
see
this
being
a
decent
dessert
beer
something
chocolate
would
compliment
nicely
i
think
after
drinking
my
second
three
philosophers
i
had
to
come
back
and
increase
my
ratings
the
balance
of
sweet
malts
spice
and
alcohol
is
really
impressive
and
delicious
ill
get
this
again
very
soon
i
will
also
reach
out
and
experiment
with
other
quads
decent
drinkability
its
not
a
session
beer
but
it
was
very
tasty
dry
bitter
finish
that
was
almost
sour
and
left
a
pucker
would
definitely
like
to
try
this
beer
again
and
even
pair
it
with
cheeses
or
food
it
was
very
good
but
not
great
d
quite
ill
have
a
second
or
a
third
it
would
be
great
with
duck
and
its
great
with
a
good
dark
chocolate
overall
i
was
expecting
way
better
people
seem
to
overly
hype
this
beer
for
some
reason
not
just
from
reviews
but
from
other
people
i
know
this
beer
is
the
worst
ommegang
offering
that
i
have
tried
and
i
wont
buy
this
one
again
i
capped
this
one
to
save
the
nice
carbonation
and
in
the
hopes
that
i
would
drink
it
later
to
get
the
value
of
the
bottle
but
i
havent
returned
to
it
its
just
not
that
appealing
sorry
mom
still
love
you
hv
not
too
harsh
or
bitter
on
the
palate
great
brew
about
as
good
as
it
gets
from
a
balance
standpoint
i
enjoy
warm
as
sipper
or
a
bit
more
chilled
as
a
drinker
it
is
also
very
predictable
maybe
being
located
relatively
close
to
the
brewery
helps
i
would
highly
recommended
this
beer
it
very
complex
and
would
par
well
with
a
strong
blue
cheese
i
had
this
in
a
sniffer
and
a
touch
warmer
than
i
would
have
cared
for
overall
a
good
beer
and
interesting
beer
but
less
complex
than
i
was
hoping
for
very
sweet
but
interestinly
funky
d
i
maybe
biased
because
i
love
this
style
but
this
is
a
wonderful
beer
that
i
really
enjoyed
quite
enjoyable
this
one
was
ill
pick
this
up
for
a
diversion
whenever
i
feel
as
if
i
need
well
diverted
a
true
personal
favorite
another
spoton
ommegang
beer
i
wouldnt
say
this
one
is
in
the
same
class
as
st
bernardus
westy
or
rochefort
but
its
cetainly
in
the
top
5
ive
come
across
so
far
awesome
stuff
d
ive
had
this
before
and
i
think
its
a
wonderful
beer
i
think
some
age
would
make
this
beer
even
better
md
medium
to
light
body
thought
it
would
be
heavier
for
the
style
but
has
good
use
of
carbonation
finishes
sour
on
the
palate
and
the
alcohol
is
nowhere
to
be
found
other
than
making
you
feel
light
on
your
feet
after
drinking
a
750ml
bottle
sums
up
as
really
good
flavor
easy
to
drink
and
a
great
twist
on
a
quad
this
beer
is
to
be
savored
in
smaller
servings
this
beer
pours
a
deep
brown
color
with
a
ruby
tint
when
held
under
light
thin
tan
foam
and
little
lace
the
aroma
is
chocolate
with
hints
of
banana
and
toast
well
balanced
its
flavor
is
mainly
chocolate
with
raisin
notes
and
is
again
well
balanced
the
mouthfeel
is
full
smooth
and
filling
while
meant
to
be
sipped
it
would
be
hard
to
drink
more
than
one
at
a
time
ommegang
three
philosophers
is
a
very
good
beer
highly
recommended
i
know
this
is
quite
an
accomplishment
to
find
such
a
good
mix
between
a
quad
and
a
lambic
but
this
is
not
what
i
expected
was
looking
for
a
quad
with
a
hint
of
cherry
and
got
a
sweet
cherry
mess
not
a
huge
fan
of
the
sours
but
trying
not
to
let
that
ding
my
rating
interesting
experience
and
glad
i
tried
it
tastes
like
black
cherry
and
brownies
black
forest
cake
beer
typical
bubbly
yet
creamy
ommegang
carbonation
that
they
do
so
well
the
beer
pours
a
rich
blend
of
mahogany
and
maroon
with
some
ruby
spots
shining
through
upon
direct
lighting
the
off
white
head
is
monstrous
filling
top
half
of
the
glass
retention
is
great
and
so
is
lacing
even
for
a
style
where
i
expect
a
bit
of
each
i
took
3
philosophers
out
of
the
fridge
and
served
immediately
and
cold
the
kriek
comes
through
very
strongly
cherry
and
earthy
notes
it
takes
a
long
time
to
open
up
and
let
the
caramel
plum
and
fig
notes
really
shine
through
as
well
the
taste
rounded
into
shape
much
sooner
and
ommegang
really
did
nail
the
blend
of
quad
and
kriek
sour
cherry
is
a
slight
but
very
welcome
addition
to
the
standard
quad
flavors
the
only
thing
holding
it
back
is
some
alcohol
on
the
close
that
passes
from
a
pleasant
warming
to
a
bit
of
harsh
heat
the
mouthfeel
is
superb
a
rich
and
full
body
that
stops
short
of
stout
like
viscosity
the
carbonation
seems
muted
at
first
but
by
the
time
it
hits
the
back
of
my
tongue
its
exploded
refreshing
my
palate
and
highlighting
some
of
the
otherwise
more
background
notes
specifically
some
of
the
spicy
yeast
phenols
the
aforementioned
slight
booziness
hurts
the
drinkability
some
but
other
than
that
its
a
great
beer
and
the
cherry
kriek
blend
helps
distinguish
it
from
most
of
the
rest
of
the
quads
d
not
quite
as
boozy
and
overly
intense
as
i
remember
but
something
id
still
have
a
bit
of
trouble
drinking
a
significant
quantity
of
pours
a
gorgeous
dark
amberred
with
a
very
light
tan
head
that
hangs
out
for
a
while
smells
of
cherries
up
front
followed
by
malts
and
alcohol
this
is
a
truly
wellbalanced
beer
the
alcohol
is
there
and
it
packs
a
punch
but
the
drink
managed
to
stay
smooth
and
not
too
sweet
the
cherry
lambic
does
add
a
bit
to
the
sweetness
but
when
later
revisited
discovered
the
tartness
it
brings
to
the
table
this
beer
will
warm
you
up
this
is
easily
one
of
my
favorites
though
its
out
of
my
comfort
zone
of
dark
brews
ill
be
coming
back
to
this
one
until
its
pulled
off
of
the
market
as
a
new
yorker
by
birth
and
a
belgian
in
spirit
ommegang
has
long
been
at
the
top
of
my
list
of
musttry
american
breweries
and
needless
to
say
this
beer
did
not
disappoint
all
this
beer
needed
was
a
frenchdutch
label
and
i
would
have
been
convinced
it
was
an
import
the
deep
yet
pronounced
flavors
mixed
well
with
the
beers
high
abv
making
it
a
great
example
of
the
style
topnotch
no
question
about
it
bottle
pours
hazy
dark
red
with
a
small
short
lived
head
nose
is
very
fruity
sweet
malt
and
alcohol
full
body
with
sweet
malt
brown
sugar
yeast
and
cherry
flavor
in
the
beginning
with
floral
hops
pleasantly
kick
in
the
finish
wonderful
beer
cant
believe
i
havent
tried
or
dont
remember
having
tried
this
one
before
wow
super
complex
unique
smooth
and
balanced
i
like
that
the
finish
isnt
dry
but
id
like
a
bit
more
sweet
maltyness
no
i
wouldnt
its
great
just
the
way
it
is
md
quite
light
bodied
and
pleasant
on
the
tongue
the
drinkability
suffers
slightly
because
of
the
carbonation
a
few
sips
in
and
i
am
already
feeling
the
carbonation
building
up
within
still
its
a
great
tasting
beer
that
is
definitely
worth
trying
i
will
be
picking
up
some
more
of
this
on
my
next
run
to
the
us
i
love
quads
but
this
one
isnt
my
favorite
a
fine
brew
to
be
sure
tho
no
complaints
if
dry
is
your
thing
this
might
be
the
quad
for
you
not
bad
just
not
a
great
quad
style
example
if
you
make
a
couple
great
ales
and
at
least
one
standard
quad
then
sure
have
fun
with
a
blend
like
this
but
dont
make
this
your
one
quad
entry
i
am
going
to
have
to
remember
this
one
for
new
years
would
rather
toast
to
beer
than
to
champagne
and
this
beer
would
really
fit
the
bill
d
very
drinkable
needs
to
be
sipped
to
enjoy
the
mouthfeel
and
aftertaste
this
one
is
going
into
by
beer
cellar
want
to
age
it
and
try
it
again
definately
a
good
beer
cheers
omgang
drinkability
suffers
from
price
and
a
little
from
alcohol
content
i
enjoy
belgian
quads
but
their
high
alcohol
and
smooth
taste
are
a
deadly
combination
best
part
about
this
beer
is
the
availability
really
enjoying
this
beer
saved
this
to
share
with
dad
wonderful
tasting
this
is
reminiscent
of
troeggs
mad
elf
one
of
my
favorite
christmas
beers
cheers
overall
had
this
on
tap
at
a
sports
bar
it
was
the
only
thing
worth
while
on
tap
and
am
very
happy
i
did
easy
to
sip
but
the
alcohol
is
deceiving
so
i
suggest
pairing
with
some
cheese
or
pizza
that
is
what
i
did
because
3
of
these
bad
boys
went
down
very
easily
and
the
alcohol
content
caught
me
off
guard
in
a
good
way
cheers
ommegang
what
a
nice
find
for
me
to
the
rest
of
the
ba
world
this
is
old
news
but
to
me
it
is
a
wonderful
brand
new
find
for
the
money
this
may
be
the
best
quad
ive
had
poured
from
a
12oz
bottle
in
a
duinen
chalice
lovely
dark
red
amber
in
color
with
a
nice
tan
head
which
quickly
recedes
into
the
glass
the
taste
is
awsome
fruit
cherries
ill
buy
this
for
as
long
as
i
can
im
happy
i
finally
pulled
the
trigger
and
bought
this
beer
no
regrets
however
i
wont
be
buying
this
one
again
but
would
never
turn
it
down
if
offered
to
me
drnkability
this
is
definitly
a
sipping
beer
because
it
will
sneak
up
on
you
but
tasty
and
very
enjoyable
poured
a
hazy
brownishred
from
a
12
oz
bottle
with
abv
on
the
label
nice
thick
head
which
slowly
dissipates
to
a
thin
head
that
stays
aroma
is
predominantly
cherries
with
hints
of
yeast
and
alcohol
delicious
brew
taste
is
again
predominantly
cherry
with
the
abv
masked
very
well
smooth
silky
finish
with
excellent
lacing
a
solid
solid
brew
from
ommegang
very
highly
recommended
quad
just
be
careful
the
smoothness
and
delicious
taste
makes
you
want
to
have
more
but
the
abv
will
hit
you
before
you
know
cheers
d
given
the
high
abv
it
is
quite
drinkable
i
probably
wouldnt
reach
for
another
immediately
after
due
to
the
abv
but
outside
of
that
it
isnt
too
much
to
handle
more
than
one
of
at
all
overall
i
wouldnt
be
in
any
hurry
to
buy
this
beer
again
d
i
picked
this
up
in
a
gift
set
with
a
bpa
and
triple
perfection
and
the
chalice
i
mentioned
for
about
18
which
wasnt
terrible
at
all
i
would
get
this
again
on
a
chilly
night
when
im
in
the
mood
for
a
sipper
but
i
wouldnt
see
myself
buying
it
regularly
a
for
sure
special
occasion
beer
pours
a
deepish
red
with
a
pillowy
belgianesque
head
slightly
cloudy
from
the
small
amount
of
yeast
that
pours
at
the
end
of
the
bottle
aroma
is
of
dark
fruits
caramel
sweet
malts
and
belgian
yeast
esters
flavor
is
complex
and
well
balanced
lots
of
dark
rum
soaked
fruits
plum
and
figs
caramel
and
toffee
sweet
graininess
is
present
some
sour
cherries
are
noticeable
and
the
flavor
of
the
cherries
increases
as
the
beer
warms
i
let
this
one
warm
up
to
room
temperature
and
it
was
fantastic
alcohol
is
amazingly
well
hidden
and
this
is
a
very
drinkable
beer
for
the
abv
overall
quite
an
interesting
and
flavorful
beer
d
dangerously
drinkable
great
fruity
sour
taste
but
not
so
far
away
from
just
a
great
beer
very
easy
to
drink
and
would
recommend
to
pick
up
a
bottle
d
this
ale
is
very
drinkable
for
the
higher
abv
but
i
wouldnt
have
more
than
one
something
isnt
working
here
for
me
maybe
its
the
ommegang
glass
with
the
gold
ring
around
that
came
with
the
beers
dont
get
me
wrong
this
is
a
good
beer
but
i
think
the
glass
tastes
too
much
like
metal
to
me
ill
have
to
try
this
again
with
a
different
glass
served

d
yes
but
dont
think
you
are
going
to
have
a
few
this
is
a
great
sipping
beer
i
wish
it
got
colder
in
florida
my
ass
would
be
outside
getting
a
chill
and
chasing
it
away
with
the
warmness
this
provides
d
drank
about
twothirds
of
the
bottle
and
think
that
was
about
all
i
needed
excellent
sipping
beer
i
have
just
started
getting
in
to
this
style
and
am
really
taking
a
liking
to
these
belgians
oa
a
great
beer
started
a
night
with
it
and
intend
to
start
many
others
similarly
given
the
taste
and
texture
overall
a
a
damnnear
exceptional
brew
d
i
found
this
to
be
very
easy
drinking
the
10
was
there
but
it
blended
in
with
the
drink
tremendously
the
biggest
downside
of
this
drink
was
that
the
flavor
didnt
last
as
long
as
it
could
have
i
wish
it
had
more
follow
through
aside
from
that
it
was
a
great
quad
especially
considering
that
its
an
american
take
on
belgian
beer
it
is
true
to
the
style
and
a
quality
brew
i
wouldnt
pass
this
one
up
d
this
certainly
isnt
a
drain
pour
but
i
am
kind
of
disappointed
i
hadnt
had
this
beer
in
a
couple
of
years
and
i
remembered
it
being
much
better
than
this
the
aroma
is
spot
on
but
the
flavor
is
dissonant
and
unpleasant
the
spicy
yeast
character
seems
inappropriate
for
a
dark
belgian
and
it
clashes
with
the
cherry
maybe
it
its
just
that
this
beer
is
better
in
the
bottle
or
maybe
it
has
lost
something
in
the
last
couple
of
years
but
it
seems
like
a
shadow
of
what
i
remember
it
as
d
not
a
style
of
beer
i
usually
drink
but
am
trying
to
expose
myself
to
enjoyed
the
smoothness
and
complexity
high
alcohol
was
blended
well
in
the
taste
and
detectable
by
my
fuzzy
feeling
face
after
consumption
it
worked
as
a
great
slow
sipping
compliment
to
my
slow
paced
reading
drinkabilty
not
a
beer
that
you
would
want
to
drink
with
a
quickness
the
more
it
warms
the
more
the
caramel
toffee
notes
come
out
very
drinkable
wow
at
9
8
it
feels
a
bit
boozy
but
all
in
all
it
is
a
fantastic
beer
the
combination
of
dark
sweet
malts
and
tart
cherries
is
outstanding
im
glad
that
i
have
another
one
of
these
in
the
basement
this
is
a
big
rich
quad
and
amost
sweet
enough
in
caracter
to
have
with
dessert
or
even
as
a
sipper
notes
yes
d
alcohol
is
present
in
the
flavor
and
the
sweetness
can
be
overbearing
not
for
everone
im
had
plenty
of
10
beers
that
were
far
better
at
hiding
the
alcohol
but
the
alcohol
taste
is
actually
an
improvement
to
this
beer
adn
adds
a
bit
to
the
flavor
making
it
a
touch
warming
im
left
a
bit
disappointed
overall
i
thought
this
might
dethrone
hennepin
as
my
favorite
ommegang
brew
but
it
falls
short
d
easy
drink
goes
down
smooth
great
beer
to
sit
down
and
enjoy
a
nice
dinner
or
a
round
of
brews
with
the
amigos
i
could
definitely
have
a
couple
more
a
great
after
dinner
beer
along
with
a
rocky
patel
vintage
cigar
mouthfeel
heavy
mild
carbonation
drinkability
is
only
average
with
a
high
abv
like
this
one
but
its
worth
every
sip
overall
quite
good
a
very
solid
quad
but
i
prefer
it
with
some
age
i
certainly
recommend
this
if
quads
are
your
thing
as
it
is
an
interesting
take
on
the
style
cheers
drinkability
surrounds
the
evenings
activities
not
a
session
beer
and
two
of
these
beers
is
more
than
enough
take
my
advice
if
you
have
friends
that
dont
like
beer
but
enjoy
red
wine
bring
this
to
your
next
snooty
box
social
di
like
this
beer
its
interestingit
has
a
good
burn
to
it
it
keeps
you
guessing
and
its
very
easy
to
drink
d
this
is
a
nice
beer
for
a
dreary
rainy
or
snowy
day
warms
you
up
on
the
inside
for
me
one
to
two
in
a
sitting
would
suffice
as
this
is
a
sipping
beer
pours
a
dark
redamber
with
little
head
smells
are
the
darkest
of
fruits
some
yeast
alcohol
and
some
malt
tastes
are
plums
cherries
yeast
and
alcohol
pretty
damn
hot
mouthfeel
is
kinda
thick
and
drinkability
is
slow
definitely
take
your
time
with
this
beer
d
thick
in
body
and
flavor
profile
definitely
goes
best
with
food
d
drinkability
is
moderate
the
taste
for
the
abv
is
certainly
great
but
its
an
assured
sipper
that
really
sneaks
up
on
you
mouthfeel
is
a
little
thin
and
is
just
a
little
too
carbonated
overall
a
nice
beer
and
an
interesting
twist
on
the
standard
quad
for
the
price
its
hard
to
beat
and
of
ommegangs
lineup
overall
a
nice
and
flavorful
quad
but
its
not
overly
in
your
face
or
complex
and
suffers
from
that
a
bit
certainly
a
good
beer
for
the
proce
just
not
a
standout
d
fairly
bold
but
very
drinkable
the
tartness
helps
to
cover
some
of
the
alcohol
taste
and
stays
crisp
d
for
being
almost
10
the
alcohol
blends
well
with
all
the
flavors
so
it
is
easier
to
drink
than
some
beers
with
a
similar
abv
this
beer
has
a
fantastic
malty
bouquet
with
hints
of
cherry
its
a
great
bouquet
and
i
would
suggest
the
pouring
instruction
on
the
bottle
be
followed
the
bottle
i
had
didnt
have
an
exception
amount
of
yeast
settlement
by
any
means
flavor
very
much
malt
driven
with
cherry
undertones
and
strong
yeast
flavors
well
balanced
with
great
structure
its
a
malt
bomb
with
an
almost
buttery
mouth
feel
i
love
this
beer
i
must
admit
that
this
is
my
first
quadruple
and
my
my
first
from
ommegang
i
am
impressed
though
and
it
was
worth
the
four
dollars
i
payed
for
it
i
recommend
it
overall
just
a
so
so
quad
imo
not
overly
impressive
i
expected
this
to
be
better
taste
810
id
have
to
describe
as
creamy
large
and
very
heavy
on
the
fruit
crispness
not
so
much
but
again
much
so
on
the
cream
dept
good
beer
overall
just
not
my
favorite
definitely
a
decent
belgium
but
again
not
the
best
ive
ever
had
drinkable
100
but
didnt
really
leave
us
talking
about
it
dnot
for
sessioning
but
a
wonderful
nightcap
i
first
had
three
philosophers
out
of
a
750
ml
bottle
and
wasnt
cultured
enough
at
the
time
to
actually
enjoy
it
but
even
then
it
tasted
amazing
i
bought
a
fourpack
of
12ounce
bottles
for
about
16
and
i
think
that
was
a
pretty
good
deal
for
this
brew
i
think
i
might
try
aging
one
or
two
of
the
bottles
just
to
see
what
would
come
of
that
mouthfeeldrinkability
body
is
just
under
medium
carbonation
is
about
right
and
leads
to
a
bit
of
a
peppery
alcohol
finish
this
beer
is
nearly
10
abv
and
honestly
i
can
tell
however
it
seems
to
fit
the
beer
about
right
the
other
flavors
mix
well
with
it
overall
nicely
done
quad
by
ommegang
drinkabilty
not
bad
it
cant
tounch
trappist
10
or
chimay
but
its
solid
i
wouldnt
run
out
and
but
again
but
its
decent
pours
a
nice
reddish
brown
with
a
light
tan
head
that
stays
around
at
about
half
a
finger
and
leaves
some
good
lacing
nose
brings
forward
subtle
hints
of
cherries
along
with
some
light
caramel
and
dark
fruits
hints
of
molasses
the
taste
really
doesnt
bring
much
cherry
flavor
at
all
really
i
cant
detect
it
and
it
was
faint
enough
in
the
nose
the
taste
does
bring
some
belgian
yeasty
esters
and
some
caramel
good
sturdy
body
that
is
slightly
creamy
not
nearly
as
complex
as
id
like
to
see
but
pretty
good
overall
this
beer
pours
a
dark
red
color
with
a
fair
size
head
that
perisisted
through
out
it
smells
strong
and
there
is
a
strong
cherry
smell
the
taste
is
very
complex
very
heavy
full
flavor
cherry
flavor
really
stands
out
the
flavor
stays
on
your
paletee
and
theres
nothing
wrong
with
that
overall
amzing
loved
it
must
try
when
poured
from
the
bottle
this
brew
produces
a
thick
head
with
a
slight
reddish
hue
to
it
the
color
of
the
beer
is
a
truly
phenomenal
red
color
that
is
very
cloudy
the
overall
appearance
is
a
thing
of
beauty
and
only
alludes
to
the
overall
quality
of
the
brew
the
first
taste
produces
nice
cherry
hints
which
can
also
be
smelled
as
it
is
being
drank
overall
it
is
a
great
beer
but
lost
points
for
me
in
the
drinkability
category
because
of
the
strong
taste
i
know
this
taste
is
precisely
what
the
brewers
at
ommegang
were
going
for
and
thus
i
cannot
fault
their
genius
hats
off
to
ommegang
once
again
overall
this
is
a
great
desert
beer
definitly
a
one
and
done
but
you
will
want
to
revist
this
again
and
again
absolutely
delicious
i
highly
approve
of
this
beer
whereas
some
beers
of
this
style
may
try
to
blow
people
away
with
flavor
this
one
has
a
nice
harmony
between
two
flavors
which
go
together
quite
well
drinkability
yes
but
not
too
much
it
was
a
good
beer
at
first
and
a
great
beer
after
about
a
half
hour
i
just
dont
think
waiting
that
long
for
it
to
develop
deserves
too
much
i
would
recommend
it
however
if
youve
never
tried
it
is
worth
a
visit
another
brew
i
felt
i
had
to
revisit
it
pours
a
rubytinted
russet
topped
by
a
finger
of
ecru
foam
the
nose
is
a
menageatrois
of
black
cherries
rye
bread
and
dried
wheat
the
taste
begins
with
the
wheat
burnt
this
time
then
moves
into
a
solid
helping
of
slightly
medicinal
cherry
if
it
werent
for
that
bit
o
cough
medicine
this
would
have
been
great
the
body
is
a
stolid
medium
with
a
light
carbonation
and
a
somewhat
sticky
feel
overall
a
solid
outing
but
falls
a
bit
short
of
gem
status
this
bottle
pours
a
deep
red
color
that
borders
on
mahogany
there
is
no
real
foam
the
aroma
smells
strongly
of
oranges
in
addition
there
is
a
cough
syrup
like
aroma
that
is
rather
strong
for
my
liking
but
the
pleasant
aroma
all
together
with
the
orangy
booze
is
rather
nice
the
taste
is
really
nice
there
is
the
bready
banana
yeast
flavors
that
would
be
expected
in
a
belgian
style
the
mouthfeel
is
pretty
darn
smooth
no
harshness
or
bitterness
from
the
alcohol
like
you
would
expect
its
pretty
drinkable
and
an
overall
solid
brew
i
think
that
its
quite
a
nice
brew
overall
overall
i
really
enjoyed
it
i
wish
i
had
more
of
it
this
was
simply
a
left
over
bottle
from
a
while
back
i
really
enjoyed
the
experience
and
it
was
neat
to
try
the
specific
vintage
a
truly
delicious
brew
cheers
drinkability
another
great
beer
from
ommegang
this
one
is
certainly
a
sipper
but
definitely
enjoyable
and
something
ill
look
for
again
tastewise
this
is
complex
and
nigh
quaffable
im
impressed
by
the
cherry
flavor
coming
through
so
strongly
without
it
being
cloying
or
saccharine
but
the
great
yeasty
mouthfeel
and
bitterness
balance
makes
it
so
so
enjoyable
pours
a
dark
copperbrown
color
with
a
staying
2
finger
head
with
nice
lacing
looks
good
smell
is
cherries
figplumraisins
taste
is
a
market
of
fruit
with
cherries
first
then
plum
and
other
currant
fruits
its
really
creamy
and
sweet
very
tasty
mouth
feel
is
full
and
robust
so
much
fruit
mixed
with
sweet
caramel
lots
of
kriek
flavors
and
candy
so
smooth
and
tasty
one
of
my
favorite
domestic
quads
odd
profile
the
malt
and
spice
of
a
quad
with
a
hint
of
cherry
creating
almost
a
cherry
cola
note
booze
wafts
up
in
the
nose
especially
but
time
has
obviously
mellowed
the
flavor
earth
spice
toffee
quite
dry
almost
astringent
touch
of
booze
still
in
the
finish
cherry
but
it
borders
on
fakesyrup
not
all
that
impressed
but
its
hard
to
call
it
bad
good
carb
for
style
lush
but
not
prickly
in
the
mouth
it
is
quite
creamy
and
soft
and
goes
down
easy
enough
for
the
circa
10
abv
the
buttery
joys
of
this
mouthfeel
are
rarely
felt
the
taste
lingers
for
awhile
so
it
is
a
slow
drinker
despite
the
good
taste
my
first
quad
thanks
kirk
from
work
this
beer
is
a
dark
reddish
garnet
color
with
a
small
amount
of
just
off
white
head
the
beer
smells
of
belgian
yeast
plums
and
a
bit
of
cherries
the
fruityness
is
what
is
most
prevalent
in
the
taste
of
this
beer
plums
and
dried
cherries
dominate
the
alcohol
is
very
well
hidden
good
medium
to
heavy
mouthfeel
with
solid
carbonation
a
good
drinkable
belgian
beer
with
definite
replay
value
overall
an
excellent
beer
overall
the
style
doesnt
get
much
better
if
its
not
brewed
in
belgium
cheers
then
again
it
helps
when
theyre
the
home
team
well
done
lads
d
i
enjoy
a
bottle
of
this
on
certain
occasions
couldnt
drink
much
more
than
that
drinkable
given
its
percentage
and
mouthfeel
the
cherriness
has
really
mellowed
out
nicely
and
made
it
a
nice
addition
to
the
great
qualities
this
beer
already
posseses
serving
type
bottle
d
i
suggest
drinking
it
sip
by
sip
if
you
dont
like
cherry
beers
i
dont
find
they
taste
like
robitussin
this
beer
doesnt
get
they
taste
unless
you
drink
it
like
you
would
any
other
beer
i
dont
usually
like
belgian
beers
this
much
but
this
is
really
really
nice
notes
i
feel
like
i
need
to
review
this
one
again
my
other
ommegang
experiences
were
good
i
waited
to
try
this
one
last
because
i
love
quads
i
gotta
say
it
looks
like
a
quad
it
smells
like
a
quad
but
it
did
not
taste
like
one
or
have
the
same
mouthfeel
maybe
i
poured
it
wrong
and
it
lost
a
lot
of
the
elements
because
this
one
had
no
head
whatsoever
i
have
another
one
that
i
might
age
for
a
few
months
and
review
again
i
refuse
to
believe
this
score
but
it
will
have
to
do
for
now
overall
impression
i
love
this
beer
body
smell
and
flavor
of
a
excellent
quad
style
delicious
syrupy
concoction
taste
is
zesty
sweetish
with
light
spiciness
lots
of
fruit
and
port
up
front
light
tartness
in
zesty
finish
with
long
woodytoasty
grain
and
driedfigskin
aftertaste
d
a
really
nice
brew
from
ommegang
the
cherry
character
is
a
bit
understated
but
thats
generally
a
good
thing
in
these
types
of
beers
i
wasnt
blown
away
at
any
point
but
ive
enjoyed
this
beer
d
an
absolutely
top
notch
beer
this
is
one
of
my
new
favorites
the
complexity
of
this
one
just
propels
it
a
well
made
beer
a
great
interpretation
of
a
belgian
quad
really
loved
how
all
the
components
came
together
i
am
so
impressed
with
the
brewery
and
what
the
have
to
offer
with
the
3
philosophers
my
first
time
trying
it
was
at
their
brewery
tour
however
there
is
a
huge
difference
between
tasting
this
beer
in
a
1oz
dixie
cup
vs
a
full
12oz
glass
this
beer
takes
time
to
mellow
and
reveal
its
true
character
you
will
not
be
disappointed
with
this
beer
this
pored
into
a
chilled
pint
glass
with
a
red
tinted
color
and
nice
white
fluffy
head
that
holds
for
quite
some
time
the
flavor
is
quite
pleasant
the
hint
of
cherry
from
the
2
lambic
makes
for
a
great
compliment
to
the
ale
they
brewed
being
a
fan
of
lambics
my
self
this
makes
for
a
excellent
brew
d
its
not
fair
to
give
this
low
marks
here
considering
that
drinkability
is
not
really
supposed
to
be
a
feature
of
this
style
however
the
intense
cherry
flavor
makes
this
a
drink
that
youll
probably
only
want
one
of
even
if
you
like
to
knock
back
a
few
huge
dark
complex
malty
ales
in
a
row
d
ok
this
is
not
a
session
beer
one
and
done
the
cherry
notes
are
heavy
but
not
as
bad
as
some
cherry
influence
brews
ive
had
overall
worth
looking
up
not
quite
my
cup
of
tea
but
other
may
love
it
beer
is
medium
bodied
and
pretty
smooth
its
almost
tart
its
mostly
sweet
the
cherry
tartness
is
interesting
not
my
favorite
beer
its
odd
not
terrible
just
ok
wow
this
stuff
is
good
a
very
nice
quad
with
a
nice
hint
of
fruit
from
the
kriek
a
truly
superb
beer
overall
i
love
it
this
is
absolutely
a
beer
i
would
recommend
to
everyone
and
would
be
a
fantastic
beer
to
use
to
introduce
to
new
comers
who
are
interested
in
belgian
beers
its
much
easier
to
drink
than
it
may
seem
and
it
is
thoroughly
enjoyable
i
am
willing
to
bet
that
it
will
cellar
exceptionally
well
however
i
would
also
bet
that
i
dont
have
the
patience
to
find
out
unfortunately
if
you
are
enjoying
this
with
food
i
would
stick
with
deserts
to
best
pull
out
the
sweet
cherries
and
chocolate
in
such
case
try
it
with
a
flourless
chocolate
cake
chocolate
mousse
chocolate
cherry
trifle
or
really
anything
with
either
chocolate
or
cherries
in
it
i
am
not
much
for
words
this
i
can
hardly
call
a
beer
though
it
is
incredible
i
truly
love
the
smell
and
how
smooth
this
beer
is
to
drink
definitely
a
sipping
beer
not
something
you
will
want
to
drink
down
as
fast
as
you
can
take
your
time
and
enjoy
d
considering
the
strong
flavor
and
alcohol
its
good
a
sipper
for
sure
but
a
great
beer
this
smells
and
drinks
like
a
wine
but
mouthfeel
is
definitely
beer
carbonation
hits
the
sides
of
your
mouth
then
swirl
to
the
front
in
a
sweet
frothy
cream
the
feel
is
excellent
a
very
drinkable
beer
especially
for
the
alcohol
content
dthis
is
my
second
time
having
this
beer
and
it
keeps
getting
better
very
aromatic
floral
and
spice
malts
and
fruits
are
evident
alcohol
permiates
the
nose
taste
grains
and
alcohol
make
a
splash
right
away
then
is
met
with
the
sweet
fruits
and
malts
cherries
raisins
and
more
alcohol
remains
for
extended
stay
warming
with
every
sip
the
mouthfeel
is
part
of
the
taste
the
carbonation
expands
on
the
palate
and
opens
the
taste
buds
exposing
the
flavors
creamy
and
velvety
easier
to
drink
with
every
sip
as
it
warms
and
the
initial
shock
of
the
style
settles
in
this
really
good
i
like
the
cherry
ale
blended
in
pairs
nicely
with
beef
or
lamb
ive
fallen
in
love
with
this
beer
again
after
some
time
away
sigh
d
it
drank
really
well
and
was
a
decent
quad
offering
that
tasted
legit
but
honestly
didnt
have
a
big
kriek
flavor
and
nose
like
i
thought
it
would
it
was
still
tasty
pours
dark
copper
color
with
one
finger
offwhite
head
head
dissipates
fairly
quickly
aroma
deep
yeast
sweet
malts
with
hint
of
fruits
cherry
and
apricots
perhaps
warming
alcohol
taste
sweetness
upfront
very
fruity
and
malty
alcohol
hidden
very
well
slightly
bitter
finish
full
body
very
rich
smooth
quad
extremely
drinkable
for
abv
probably
one
of
the
best
quads
ive
ever
tried
great
brew
taste
my
wifes
words
it
tastes
like
a
chocolate
covered
cherry
true
that
cherry
is
very
noticable
the
effervescence
adds
a
bit
of
an
odd
mf
almost
makes
me
think
dry
at
the
end
though
it
isnt
alcohol
flavor
becomes
more
apparent
as
the
beer
warms
up
but
still
quite
delicious
ive
not
tried
a
fresh
bottle
yet
but
that
will
definitely
be
something
i
pick
up
on
my
next
trip
to
total
wines
mf
is
pleasant
beer
is
not
heavy
at
all
and
effervescence
is
pleasing
aside
from
the
odd
sensation
it
lends
to
the
beer
from
the
750
ml
corked
bottle
sampled
on
august
5
2010
a
hazy
amber
pour
with
a
generous
fluffy
silky
tan
head
that
lingers
and
laces
beautifully
the
aroma
is
full
of
floral
hops
and
a
pleasing
mellow
maltiness
with
a
little
spiciness
smooth
but
bold
mouthfeel
the
taste
brings
out
the
cherry
and
the
hops
more
than
the
malts
but
it
also
brings
out
a
noted
alcohol
flavor
which
takes
away
from
the
overall
experience
for
me
d
a
slow
drinking
beer
but
still
i
would
have
a
couple
of
these
of
the
course
of
the
night
i
enjoyed
this
beer
something
good
right
here
drinkability
this
is
easily
a
sipping
beer
based
on
the
flavor
the
body
and
obviously
the
abv
i
may
have
to
pick
up
a
few
bottles
for
the
cellar
a
wonderful
offering
from
brewery
ommegang
i
fist
sampled
this
beer
at
the
brewery
a
few
days
ago
and
i
highly
recommend
to
anyone
to
take
their
tour
it
was
a
good
experience
d
an
excellently
complex
belgianstyle
quite
delightful
i
have
been
saving
this
beer
for
just
over
a
year
and
it
was
worth
the
wait
id
be
happy
to
drink
more
of
this
d
for
a
beer
this
strong
very
drinkable
deep
dark
ruby
red
creamy
bone
colored
head
starts
out
thick
but
sticks
around
as
a
thin
but
solid
layer
of
cream
dark
fruits
and
dark
rich
cherry
aroma
the
flavor
follows
the
aroma
almost
exactly
the
same
dark
fruit
and
cherry
along
with
some
sweet
brown
sugar
downsides
are
a
slight
metallic
taste
and
the
lack
of
dimension
the
cherry
and
sugary
sweetness
keep
the
malt
complexities
from
being
noticed
finishes
sweet
and
a
little
thin
drinkability
is
good
though
i
wouldnt
drink
more
than
a
couple
if
i
had
major
plans
this
is
a
delightful
offering
from
ommegang
cooperstown
knows
belgians
jd
dsurprisingly
good
for
a
quad
the
insistence
of
the
cherry
flavor
might
be
its
only
drawback
d
a
solid
belgian
quad
the
alcohol
is
present
but
not
overbearing
the
flavors
mix
well
even
if
the
smell
doesnt
make
it
all
that
attractive
overall
a
nice
beer
worth
picking
up
again
drinkability
nice
alternative
take
on
a
quad
with
the
addition
of
cherry
personally
i
may
have
enjoyed
it
more
without
the
cherry
but
personal
taste
aside
this
really
is
a
great
beer
pours
a
amberbrown
colour
that
starts
off
with
a
lot
of
head
but
it
quickly
dissipates
without
any
lacing
smell
is
cherry
plum
raisin
and
faint
belgian
yeast
taste
is
a
bit
tart
has
the
cherry
that
this
beer
advertises
but
not
enough
of
everything
else
id
expect
in
a
quad
carbonation
level
is
nice
a
tad
boozy
but
i
still
had
no
trouble
finishing
my
half
of
this
bottle
i
could
down
easily
down
the
whole
750ml
bottle
but
this
beer
deserves
to
at
least
be
sipped
frequently
instead
of
outright
chugged
d
if
you
like
sour
cherry
taste
there
is
nothing
to
stop
you
from
drinking
this
i
wouldnt
take
another
one
for
free
overall
i
thoroughly
enjoyed
this
offering
from
ommegang
and
the
whole
750ml
to
myself
had
me
buzzed
to
a
great
point
that
didnt
go
away
for
a
few
hours
i
drank
it
while
i
watched
the
mlb
allstar
game
and
finished
it
before
the
4th
inning
and
i
was
feeling
it
well
up
until
i
went
to
bed
pours
a
deep
reddish
brown
with
a
finger
of
beige
head
middling
retention
strong
lacing
aroma
is
of
cherries
plums
yeast
alcohol
taste
follows
the
smell
except
and
maybe
this
is
me
you
lose
some
of
the
yeast
characters
evident
in
the
nose
some
caramel
and
muted
spice
notes
mouthfeel
is
medium
bodied
with
prickly
carbonation
pretty
drinkable
and
worth
trying
interesting
take
on
the
style
with
the
lambic
addition
but
imo
not
on
par
with
the
upper
echelon
i
e
belgiantrappist
brews
2008
brew
deep
red
amber
pour
light
head
strong
wine
aroma
alcoholic
and
fruity
cherry
flavor
comes
in
two
stages
the
primary
stage
is
malty
cherry
and
dark
fruit
the
secondary
stage
is
alcoholic
with
a
cherry
base
with
some
limited
floral
hints
the
body
is
of
medium
thickness
the
flavor
and
aroma
are
sophisticated
and
complex
and
lead
into
a
delicate
finish
if
philosophy
is
an
intellectual
method
of
elucidation
compared
to
a
scientific
doctrine
of
propositions
then
beer
philosophizing
is
too
an
activity
that
clarifies
our
thoughts
of
the
fine
brew
the
three
philosophers
quadrupel
exemplifies
this
activity
d
although
pretty
easy
to
drink
when
it
warms
a
bit
this
beer
remains
around
10
abv
and
i
can
taste
it
its
flavorful
surprisingly
tart
sweet
and
a
bit
boozy
12oz
is
enough
but
i
am
enjoying
every
bit
of
it
drinkability
suffers
from
the
hotness
i
have
a
2006
bottle
in
the
cellar
and
will
rerate
but
this
beer
just
falls
waaaay
short
of
the
legends
of
quadrupel
fame
d
if
i
really
enjoyed
this
beer
i
could
have
two
or
three
no
problem
this
is
a
well
crafted
beer
just
not
my
thing
dont
think
i
will
ever
be
picking
up
another
bottle
drinkability
very
drinkable
im
about
to
drink
this
entire
750
and
will
def
want
another
m
d
nice
and
crisp
and
very
well
carbonated
drinkability
is
good
in
terms
of
flavor
but
abv
is
high
served
from
bottle
into
a
la
chouffe
tulip
pours
a
dark
brown
with
a
3
finger
offwhite
head
that
subsides
to
minimal
after
sitting
a
bit
maintained
nice
lacing
throughout
the
only
aromas
i
could
pick
up
on
were
fruit
wtih
a
trace
of
alcohol
the
flavor
followed
the
smell
with
only
fruit
and
alcohol
showing
up
it
had
a
medium
feel
on
the
palate
with
medium
carbonation
overall
this
was
not
bad
for
a
quad
it
was
very
smooth
and
drinkable
i
would
definitely
purchase
more
and
drink
it
again
allinall
this
one
is
very
satisfying
o
such
a
pleasure
to
drink
what
a
unique
beer
its
satisfyingly
rich
but
isnt
cloying
or
heavy
lives
up
to
the
hype
curious
how
it
will
age
cant
imagine
it
getting
better
actually
as
i
like
how
the
flavors
are
now
and
dont
see
them
improving
with
time
definitely
worth
a
try
an
outstanding
craft
brew
pretty
good
beer
will
probably
pick
up
some
more
this
is
a
good
beer
i
have
a
feeling
im
drinking
this
bottle
at
a
somewhat
premature
state
i
have
another
bottle
cellared
that
i
will
enjoy
a
few
years
down
the
road
at
that
time
ill
offer
some
more
details
delicious
beer
could
not
be
happier
with
it
d
fairly
drinkable
though
not
overly
so
the
sweetness
becomes
a
bit
much
after
a
while
the
aroma
flavor
and
look
of
this
beer
are
enough
for
me
to
buy
it
again
though
if
anything
buy
this
beer
so
that
you
can
look
at
it
it
is
a
marvel
to
see
bought
in
a

highly
drinkable
three
philosophers
is
artfully
crafted
blending
rich
malt
with
flavorful
accents
such
as
chocolate
and
cherries
for
me
it
tasted
like
a
chocolate
covered
cherry
with
liquor
infused
into
it
which
i
do
not
find
very
appetizing
but
i
can
appreciate
the
complexity
and
subtleties
of
this
belgium
style
brew
i
feel
that
it
had
great
length
from
start
to
finish
and
the
taste
lingered
long
after
my
last
sip
the
color
is
a
deep
red
with
a
nice
rich
head
with
a
slightly
aggressive
pour
the
nose
opens
up
and
the
aromas
are
exactly
as
they
taste
the
texture
is
very
smooth
slightly
thick
and
easy
to
drink
perhaps
comparable
to
guinness
from
tap
but
much
larger
in
complexity
and
body
i
believe
that
it
would
pair
nicely
with
fruit
or
chocolate
as
an
after
dinner
drink
the
nose
is
a
blend
of
spice
dark
fruit
a
mild
medicinal

brett
and

the

nicedrinking

dark
strong

is
a
fantastic
sipping
beer
spread
this
one
out
over
an
hour
or
so
as
the
character
really
comes
out
on
warming
d
this
beer
is
a
pretty
strong
beer
i
do
like
this
beer
however
i
would
probably
only
drink
a
couple
in
one
night
this
beer
would
be
a
good
starter
beer
for
a
pregame
for
a
long
night
pours
a
cloudy
crimson
mahogany
color
with
a
thick
foamy
head
the
aroma
is
understated
but
notes
of
yeast
and
a
dry
cherry
sweetness
are
discernible
the
flavor
is
more
of
the
same
with
notes
of
dried
cherries
belgian
yeast
and
grapes
the
flavor
is
not
overly
sweet
with
the
big
cherry
presence
though
and
it
has
a
bit
of
tartness
to
contrast
the
sweetness
not
quite
as
big
in
flavor
or
body
as
i
would
expect
from
a
belgianstyle
quad
but
an
interesting
flavorful
and
satisfying
beer
nonetheless
you
can
never
go
wrong
w
three
philosophers
one
of
my
alltime
faves
recommended
to
anyone
who
enjoys
well
crafted
beer
the
best
use
of
cherries
in
a
beer
that
ive
come
across
the
availabilty
is
nice
too
all
in
all
an
exceptional
brew
and
one
that
on
one
should
miss
this
was
delicious
and
i
highly
recommend
it
drinkability
i
will
no
doubt
seek
this
out
again
i
have
been
drinking
this
for
the
past
forty
five
minutes
or
so
and
have
thoroughly
enjoyed
it
honestly
the
cherry
taste
in
it
just
makes
my
day
this
is
a
great
tasting
quad
and
for
a
style
i
have
not
really
enjoyed
in
the
past
this
has
made
me
look
highly
upon
brewery
ommegang
very
drinkable
for
such
a
high
abv
and
very
enjoyable
d
smooth
nice
drinking
ale
even
with
higher
alcohol
it
goes
down
well
drinkability
this
is
a
very
good
beer
that
has
a
style
of
its
own
as
far
as
most
other
belgian
style
beers
i
have
had
the
dark
body
and
taste
give
it
a
very
rich
full
bodied
flavor
that
lingers
for
a
while
this
is
a
good
beer
to
sip
on
but
im
not
sure
if
its
something
i
could
drink
a
whole
bottle
of
in
one
sitting
drinkability
while
i
really
enjoyed
all
the
aspects
about
this
beer
it
sits
a
tad
heavy
and
the
higher
abv
definitely
made
itself
known
by
the
end
i
really
think
12
oz
is
a
great
serving
size
of
this
as
it
allows
for
moderate
indulgence
so
when
i
do
crack
my
08
it
will
have
to
be
in
the
presence
of
friends
granted
i
dont
know
if
quadruple
is
even
a
real
category
and
if
so
whether
or
not
this
fits
the
style
its
simply
ok
the
flagship
and
the
hennepin
are
far
better
pours
a
cloudy
amber
brownish
color
with
large
offwhite
fluffy
head
and
good
lacing
lots
of
fizzy
carbonation

a
slight
floral
fruity
hoppy

cherries
are

apparent

as
well
very
sweet
sour
chalky

slightly
bitter

medium

fantastic
beer
i
was
very
impressed
with
waited
a
while
to
try
this
beer
because
it
is
available
everywhere
i
go
for
beer
i
will
most
definitely
be
purchasing
this
fantastic
brew
again
in
the
near
future
d
this
beer
is
good
but
im
glad
i
shared
this
two
others
i
usually
compare
all
categories
of
my
reviews
i
can
to
other
beers
of
the
same
style
but
this
is
my
first
quad
so
i
must
say
im
not
sure
how
this
one
should
drink
per
the
style
with
that
said
i
would
love
to
have
again
quite
often
actually
but
will
always
make
sure
i
have
someone
else
to
enjoy
with
me
a
rich
dark
colour
not
quite
opaque
with
a
typical
belgian
style
head
and
plenty
of
lace
the
aroma
is
sweet
and
malty
theres
a
hint
of
the
cherries
within
it
almost
reminds
me
of
my
favourite
cough
syrup
from
when
i
was
a
kid
but
nowhere
near
as
medicinal
taste
is
a
little
on
the
sweet
side
for
my
palate
but
im
sure
that
if
i
was
pairing
this
with
a
dessert
or
some
fine
cheese
id
enjoy
it
a
whole
lot
more
this
is
a
very
well
made
beer
to
be
sure
would
definitely
get
this
one
again
appearance2
finger
head
didnt
linger
not
much
lacing
either
im
torn
on
this
beer
overall
i
had
very
high
expectations
based
on
what
ive
read
ab
this
brewery
but
im
a
little
disappointed
the
taste
is
good
cherries
raisins
warmth
but
the
booziness
in
the
taste
is
just
too
prominent
for
me
to
really
enjoy
it
as
others
have
mentioned
this
one
is
definitely
a
sipper
and
best
with
food
feel
is
very
unlively
not
much
carbonation
to
be
had
and
agitation
of
the
brew
does
not
seem
to
help
much
feels
a
bit
flat
on
the
palate
though
it
may
just
be
my
bottle
still
this
is
smooth
not
sticky
or
oily
in
the
least
and
a
very
easy
drinker
if
you
can
get
past
the
up
front
cherry
characteristics
of
the
ale
drinkability
is
slightly
above
the
average
for
me
though
ill
keep
the
rest
of
my
bottles
for
evaluation
further
down
the
road
my
opinion
if
you
see
this
one
give
it
a
shot
i
think
i
know
why
i
have
not
had
this
in
awhile
its
just
underwhelming
in
many
areas
andi
remember
those
same
thoughts
from
years
ago
its
pretty
drinkable
but
after
6ozs
or
so
i
was
pretty
much
done
with
it
the
bottle
says
this
is
ageable
for
up
to
five
years
but
i
dont
see
this
getting
any
better
its
just
not
that
complex
enough
as
it
is
overall
i
was
quite
disappointed
in
this
beer
it
seemed
to
be
yet
another
example
of
a
non
belgian
brewer
trying
to
make
a
belgian
style
beer
and
coming
up
well
short
i
might
try
this
again
at
some
point
but
wont
be
in
any
hurry
not
a
bad
beer
at
all
but
far
from
my
favorite
belgian
quad
style
ale
seems
to
be
lacking
a
little
malt
balance
in
there
yeah
i
like
this
one
drinkability
a
sipper
the
tart
cherry
taste
provides
an
interesting
foil
to
the
style
aftertaste
limits
viability
of
having
more
than
one
or
two
probably
better
to
have
paired
than
alone
as
i
did
drinkability
at
nearly
10
one
bottle
should
suffice
drinkability
too
sweet
and
fruity
to
be
a
session
beer
for
me
and
way
too
much
alcohol
my
whiskey
days
are
over
and
this
beer
is
a
testament
to
why
drinkability
this
got
better
and
better
as
time
went
on
i
like
fuller
more
chocolaty
quads
better
but
this
was
nice
drinkability
wise
the
alcohol
was
hitting
me
a
little
too
hard
for
me
to
want
more
than
1
additional
serving
d
exceptional
the
complexity
of
the
beer
is
engaging
keeping
me
smelling
and
sipping
the
surprising
lightness
of
taste
allows
many
such
sips
to
continue
i
will
definitely
be
picking
up
more

i
just
have
one
more
2009
release
that
i
hope
to
age
for
a
few
years
it
will
be
itneresting
how
this
develops
in

could
be
a

nothing
overbearing

standoffish

hangs
around

wish
i
could

i
will

about

i

i
can
appreciate

i
will
buy
more
but
being
offered
yearround
ill
chill
on
the
looking
aspect
this
was
a
nice
thick
bodied
quad
im
glad
to
have
tried
the
high
alcohol
content
was
very
much
present
and
rather
than
mask
it
as
some
styles
do
they
seem
to
have
embraced
it
good
stuff
though
ommegang
you
dont
disappoint
velvety
texture
with
nice
crisp
carbonation
a
deep
rich
and
complex
beer
a
sipper
although
any
alcohol
character
is
quite
subdued
this
is
an
odd
one
i
dont
have
much
experience
with
quads
or
lambics
i
dislike
the
banana
flavor
often
found
in
quads
but
im
not
finding
it
here
i
am
however
finding
lots
of
dark
malts
that
can
be
described
as
tasting
like
prunes
grapes
dark
cherries
and
caramel
and
even
a
bit
of
chocolate
in
the
background
the
lambic
provides
a
tartness
on
the
finish
and
some
cherry
before
an
odd
beer
indeed
but
a
good
one
verdict
this
is
a
beer
i
love
to
sit
down
with
and
enjoy
over
the
course
of
an
eveningits
also
a
versatile
pairing
for
a
meal
working
well
with
a
variety
of
entrees
and
desserts
thoroughly
interesting
when
fresh
im
dying
to
find
out
how
this
will
taste
in
a
few
years
this
has
made
me
curious
to
try
again
one
sample
is
not
enough
to
truly
measure
i
liked
it
overall
it
has
a
beautiful
goldenbrown
wispy
lacing
and
a
rich
flavor
and
hue
that
reminds
me
of
late
autumn
for
some
reason
drinkability
this
isnt
quite
my
thing
the
cherry
flavor
and

really
knock
this
down

me
for

who
like

highly

drinkable

i
recommend
this
to
someone
who
would
like
to
introduce
someone
to

it
is
not
overwhelming

still
rich
in

feel

with
friends
to
get
the
most
out
of
it
dreally
serve
this
at
55
degrees

above
once
it
got
closer
to

temperature
it
really
opened
up

was

made
the
alcohol
quite

any
who
very

and
extremely

quite
nice
in
taste
with
huge
flavors
of
cherry
those
with
the
nofruitinthebeer
ideology
are
missing
out
on
this

the
cherries
add
a
perfect
tart
backbone
to
a

want
to
show
a
beer
newb
how
complex
delicate
and
vast
the
flavors
can
be
in
beer
add
this
one
to
the
list
j
im
not
the
biggest
quadrupel
fan
preferring
the
paler
belgian
ales
like
strong
pale
blonde
tripel
etc
but
this
is
one
of
my
favorite
dark
belgians
very
good
malty
aroma
without
too
much
dark
fruit
extremely
drinkable
for
10
this
is
the
ultimate
winter
beer
for
me
d
sipping
but
its
a
nice
sipping
one
is
enough
for
one
day
still
worth
revisiting
as
often
as
one
would
like
i
had
thought
that
this
one
would
mature
with
a
lot
more
grace
than
it
actually
did
low
sweetness
low
body
and
a
bit
unbalanced
this
is
the
reason
for
drinking
beer
exceptional
brew
from
the
time
you
here
the
cork
pop
till
you
see
it
pour
you
start
to
feel
giddy
like
christmas
i
recieved
this
and
two
others
in
a
gift
box
set
with
nice
glass
when
poured
its
like
a
deep
cherry
waterfall
into
your
glass
the
smell
that
comes
from
the
glass
is
like
heaven
on
earth
when
the
taste
first
hit
the
tongue
you
get
that
bubbly
belgian
classic
tast
and
then
cherry
flavors
wash
the
palate
mouth
feels
like
its
full
of
micro
bubbles
washing
around
overall
a
very
drinkable
beer
this
is
currently
my
favorite
beer
i
wish
i
had
this
on
tap
at
home
kind
of
pricey
i
love
this
beer
cherry
beginning
with
an
abbey
ale
finish
complex
colorsmelltasteoverall
a
wonderful
beer
made
in
the
u
s
this
is
better
than
the
chimayssorry
guys
drinkability
a
very
tasty
sipping
beer
and
a
beer
with
much
character
true
to
its
belgian
inspiration
beautiful
deepbrown
color
with
with
an
orange
highlight
the
head
is
thick
and
fluffy
with
a
caramelized
tint
the
nose
is
pretty
complex
with
a
tart
fruitiness
taking
the
lead
cherries
and
rumsoaked
raisins
are
most
noticeable
also
an
herbal
spiciness
that
seems
to
underpin
the
fruit
character
is
also
present
these
all
carry
through
onto
the
palate
with
the
addition
of
a
pleasant
malt
preasant
that
peaks
through
flavors
of
sweet
caramel
and
even
a
light
chocolate
note
show
through
and
interweave
with
the
raisincherry
fruitiness
i
wouldnt
mind
a
little
more
cherry
presence
but
given
the
overall
balance
and
complexity
im
not
too
upset
about
it
very
smooth
with
a
lively
carbonation
nearly
perfect
mouthfeel
with
maybe
a
tad
too
much
alcohol
present
id
have
to
say
that
of
the
american
belgianstyle
beers
that
ive
tried
this
is
easily
a
top
three
maybe
my
favorite
so
far
highly
recommended
d
will
never
buy
again
belgian
quads
are
among
my
top
styles
and
this
one
was
off
for
me
i
did
not
like
it
at
all
had
half
the
bottle
and
dumped
it
it
would
have
been
good
but
it
could
not
get
over
that
cherry
flavor
that
i
hated
as
a
kid
three
philosophers
adds
a
nice
cherry
finish
to
the
sweet
malty
feel
of
a
belgian
quadrupel
its
delicious
aggressive
and
a
great
warmer
for
the
strength
and
thickness
of
this
beer
it
is
very
drinkable
pours
with
a
dark
brownish
color
that
fades
to
a
red
at
the
bottom
i
was
surprised
that
the
body
was
so
clear
considering
the
color
was
so
dark
i
could
definitely
see
my
fingers
clearly
through
the
glass
it
smelled
exactly
the
way
it
should
a
nice
strong
ale
with
hints
of
cherries
the
taste
was
reciprocated
but
the
cherries
definitely
added
a
nice
flavor
to
the
ale
my
only
problem
is
for
me
it
tasted
a
little
well
the
only
way
i
can
describe
it
is
watery
other
than
that
i
thought
this
beer
was
great
it
felt
good
in
the
mouth
and
even
with
a
high
abv
i
felt
it
was
more
drinkable
than
other
strong
ales
d
good
though
im
not
surprised
by
the
abv
it
could
have
been
smoother
i
would
rate
this
beers
drinkability
as
very
high
nice
carbonation
just
right
and
that
balance
of
sweet
sour
excellent
d
not
sure
id
want
to
drink
more
than
a
serving
of
this
but
i
have
a
750
ml
bottle
to
get
through
im
no
quad
expert
but
i
think
this
should
be
aged
for
a
couple
years
the
body
gets
more
and
more
rich
full
and
creamy
as
times
goes
on
as
this
last
glass
im
having
now
is
the
cream
of
the
crop
the
alcohol
is
hidden
well
vs
most
other
10
beers
but
its
impact
is
most
certainly
felt
havent
met
an
ommegang
brew
i
didnt
love
drinkability
is
superb
quads
need
to
be
sipped
and
appreciated
but
this
one
could
be
taken
to
different
heights
because
its
so
smooth
medium
bodied
and
just
damn
delicious
impression
this
is
one
of
a
stable
of
fine
beers
made
here
in
ny
by
ommegang
and
it
is
one
that
should
not
be
missed
by
lovers
of
belgian
ale
styles
marvelous
fairly
complex
delicious
and
satisfying
with
its
high
abv
and
depth
of
character
and
750ml
volume
theres
certainly
enough
here
for
three
philosophers
to
share
and
contemplate
the
three
of
us
decided
this
new
years
eve
not
to
contemplate
so
much
as
celebrate
and
three
philosophers
fit
the
bill
nicely
drinkability
high
drinkability
very
high
considering
its
such
a
rich
complex
brew
especially
high
for
having
a
abv
of
9
8
overall
very
well
done
a
real
king
of
beers
flavor
at
first
was
a
little
hidden
by
carbonation
but
sweet
nonetheless
as
the
beer
warms
very
complimenting
sweet
malts
and
dark
dried
fruits
mixing
with
a
slight
warming
booze
somewhat
complex
and
a
very
tasty
quad
d
this
one
is
somewhat
complex
and
also
has
a
somewhat
heavy
feel
to
it
the
malt
and
cherry
aspects
might
wear
a
bit
after
two
i
think
i
could
drink
a
maximum
of
two
of
these
before
i
would
want
to
move
on
to
something
else
nonetheless
a
good
and
interesting
brew
i
happened
to
have
both
a
12oz
bottle
from
2008
which
came
in
a
mixed
12
pack
and
a
22oz
bottle
of
2009
from
another
gift
pack
that
i
received
this
christmas
2009
i
have
to
say
the
2008
was
much
better
im
thinking
the
extra
year
of
aging
much
improved
the
flavor
my
rating
is
based
on
the
2008
bottle
but
both
were
great
beers
not
as
full
bodied
as
expected
some
decent
carbonation
lightens
this
one
and
makes
it
quite
drinkable
not
as
heavy
complex
or
dense
as
other
quads
but
worth
the
try
overall
a
very
good
interpretation
of
a
quadrupel
also
very
reasonably
priced
for
the
style
as
well
i
really
enjoy
this
i
will
buy
it
many
times
again
for
what
it
is
this
is
a
great
beer
incredibly
filling
an
highly
alcohlic
this
beer
is
best
when
savored
d
this
is
a
strong
beer
so
its
not
going
to
rate
highly
on
the
drinkability
scale
however
for
this
style
youre
not
supposed
to
throw
back
a
bunch
of
them
right
d
a
strong
ale
but
isnt
that
what
we
are
made
for
drink
away
boys
overall
this
is
a
fantastic
brew
and
would
pair
very
well
with
pork
loin
average
drinkability
for
a
9
8er
the
heat
really
makes
this
beer
limited
a
nice
interesting
beer
capable
of
being
outstanding
in
the
right
circumstances
very
drinkable
beer
it
was
almost
10
so
one
was
pretty
good
my
first
ommegang
and
very
impressive
poured
into
a
tulip
glass
cloudy
dark
chestnut
brown
with
a
tan
head
with
no
real
lacing
great
belgian
fruity
spicy
aroma
tasted
even
better
than
the
scent
this
is
full
of
flavor
cherries
of
course
but
chocolate
rasins
maybe
coffee
and
other
sour
type
fruits
are
rolling
around
in
your
mouth
you
also
do
detect
the
alcohol
in
this
was
not
sure
what
to
expect
but
it
was
a
truely
excellent
experiance
pours
a
dark
reddish
brown
with
a
big
tan
head
smells
of
ripe
cherries
taste
is
woody
and
earthy
up
front
with
a
dextriny
chocolatey
middle
and
a
slightly
tart
finish
a
hint
of
earthy
hops
in
the
aftertaste
you
can
also
barely
taste
a
hint
of
alcohol
mouthfeel
is
super
lush
carbonation
slightly
high
drinkability
is
good
though
not
as
good
as
some
quads
overall
i
would
get
this
again
but
only
on
sale
beautiful
dark
red
color
with
a
long
lasting
head
aroma
fills
the
immediate
area
with
sweet
scents
smells
like
a
red
wine
slight
alcoholic
aroma
with
light
cherry
notes
a
yeasty
character
and
a
little
bit
of
banana
tastes
of
roasted
malts
with
fruit
at
the
tip
of
the
tongue
very
dry
heavy
mouthfeel
i
enjoyed
it
another
fine
offering
from
brewery
ommegang
have
yet
to
find
one
of
these
that
i
dont
love
highly
recommend
everything
that
they
brew
heard
great
things
about
this
beer
so
i
was
so
disappointed
i
was
expecting
a
fruity
holiday
beer
and
was
confronted
by
an
antagonistic
obnoxiously
alcoholic
read
yankloving
stinkbomb
smelled
like
rotten
fermented
cherries
and
a
musty
basement
in
jersey
just
awful
tasted
like
pancake
syrup
that
had
been
sitting
at
the
bottom
of
my
trashcan
for
a
week
thank
nature
i
did
not
save
this
for
xmas
eve
as
i
would
have
been
even
more
disappointed
d
excellent
beer
thats
all
i
can
say
in
the
end
this
is
a
great
quad
and
i
cant
wait
to
revisit
this
vintage
in
a
couple
more
years
this
is
great
stuff
poured
from
a
750ml
corked
bottle
dark
clear
amber
with
a
light
tightly
lace
head
did
not
stir
up
the
sediment
from
the
bottom
aroma
is
light
with
caramel
banana
and
hops
taste
is
complex
with
malt
hops
toast
and
some
citrus
and
yeast
an
expensive
beer
but
well
worth
it
d
this
beer
is
flavorful
smooth
and
easy
to
drink
its
a
nice
american
brewed
belgian
dwhile
at
9
8
the
alcohol
isnt
too
overbearing
one
bottle
of
750ml
is
enough
for
an
evening
i
wish
it
had
a
tiny
bit
more
sweetness
drinkability
is
great
it
goes
down
pretty
easy
and
smooth
i
wouldnt
mind
having
a
couple
at
a
time
but
dont
think
id
session
it
it
may
not
be
the
truest
form
of
the
style
but
it
is
quite
a
tasty
and
well
blended
brew
d
the
abv
seems
bigger
than
it
is
making
this
a
really
nice
sweet
warming
sipper
its
quite
a
nice
beer
pretty
creative
i
was
very
excited
to
have
the
opportunity
to
sample
this
on
tap
as
i
currently
reside
half
way
across
the
country
from
brewery
ommegang
i
was
not
disappointed
i
am
a
believer
in
belgian
style
brews
and
while
ommegang
is
not
in
belgium
i
believe
they
have
represented
the
style
well
considering
the
alcohol
content
and
strength
of
the
style
this
is
very
drinkable
i
could
easily
down
more
than
one
of
these
at
a
sitting
such
a
nice
mix
of
flavors
makes
me
wish
i
had
a
lot
more
of
this
d
this
beer
is
very
drinkable
and
makes
a
good
sipper
on
these
cold
december
nights
this
beer
may
evolve
nicely
with
a
year
or
two
of
age
very
complex
i
usually
love
cherry
flavors
but
this
one
is
kind
of
odd
if
you
like
dark
belgian
styles
this
one
may
be
for
you
a
rich
and
malty
brew
with
a
distinctive
kriek
presence
a
stately
appearance
with
a
quality
head
retention
covering
and
lacing
a
garnet
brown
and
light
cloudiness
a
deep
carmel
aroma
with
cherries
and
light
alcohol
taste
is
a
bigger
version
of
the
nose
big
caramel
malt
backbone
supports
a
unique
take
on
a
quad
kriek
lambic
notes
fuse
with
the
hops
and
create
a
one
of
a
kind
finish
and
balance
multifaceted
layers
of
flavor
including
some
belgian
spice
notes
some
alcohol
in
the
finish
gives
a
wine
like
quality
that
is
gently
pushed
away
by
the
cherries
and
lambic
tartness
an
earthy
clean
dryness
in
the
finish
as
well
malt
lingers
with
light
begian
spiciness
fell
is
full
and
velvety
a
creamy
carbonation
is
the
cherry
on
top
easy
drinking
but
you
dont
want
to
go
to
fast
as
the
complexity
calls
for
a
long
savoring
with
each
swallow
overall
this
is
a
solid
beer
interesting
flavor
combination
mixes
well
together
very
balanced
and
solid
beer
drinkability
high
abv
and
a
bit
too
sweet
to
make
this
a
more
than
1
bottle
session
in
this
size
format
great
tasting
and
a
super
great
winter
beer
for
me
d
solid
well
balanced
and
smooth
a
good
sipper
with
some
nice
strong
cheese
or
a
solid
meal
this
one
is
really
a
great
quad
but
not
a
beginners
quad
at
all
this
stretches
what
i
would
define
as
a
quad
but
still
has
the
same
characteristics
unique
to
say
the
least
d
decent
domestic
quad
imitation
which
lacks
all
the
niceties
of
a
belgian
quad
i
remember
liking
this
one
better
the
first
time
i
tried
it
but
my
opinion
of
it
seems
to
have
lessened
purely
based
on
the
fact
that
ive
tried
a
lot
of
other
belgian
quads
since
then
still
a
solid
brew
di
think
the
alcohol
could
get
to
me
after
a
while
so
i
think
drinkability
would
be
about
average
ultimately
im
not
sure
that
the
aging
helped
this
particular
beer
but
i
quite
clearly
need
to
have
it
again
fresh
and
compare
the
notquite
real
cherry
seems
much
more
prominent
and
the
beer
as
a
whole
more
dried
out
and
a
bit
exhausted
that
said
three
philosophers
is
still
on
my
short
list
of
top
american
quads
poured
out
of
the
bottle
into
a
duvel
type
tulip
foamy
head
gives
way
to
thin
slick
of
head
smells
like
dark
fruit
and
lots
of
alcohol
slight
fake
cherry
taste
mixed
other
fruits
maybe
raisons
what
stands
out
to
me
is
the
heat
of
the
alcohol
and
the
bitter
finish
taste
smooths
a
bit
as
it
restsbreathes
i
didnt
find
this
beer
very
enjoyable
i
do
not
plan
on
purchasing
it
again
d
i
kind
of
have
mixed
feelings
on
this
one
on
the
one
hand
its
a
pretty
solid
midrange
quad
on
the
other
hand
a
few
more
bucks
will
get
me
a
much
better
beer
the
heft
of
this
body
and
relatively
affordable
price
makes
me
want
to
use
this
for
food
pairing
or
cooking
but
for
plain
ol
drinking
i
think
ill
stick
with
something
else
i
was
lucky
enough
to
find
a
bottle
of
the
cave
aged
version
of
this
beer
from
2006
at
a
local
store
where
nobody
seems
to
buy
craft
beer
color
is
a
dark
ruby
and
comes
with
a
quick
to
fade
white
head
nose
is
wonderfully
fruity
with
the
cherries
really
shining
at
the
same
time
the
booze
comes
in
with
some
chocolate
caramel
and
brandy
notes
and
really
makes
for
a
great
smelling
brew
taste
is
really
full
of
fruit
and
dark
malt
goodness
you
can
tell
that
the
age
on
this
beer
has
mellowed
some
of
the
flavors
in
a
good
way
body
is
full
and
although
you
can
taste
the
alcohol
it
is
really
tame
and
in
the
end
adds
depth
to
the
whole
experience
this
beer
reminds
me
a
little
bit
of
brandy
angels
share
from
lost
abbey
i
could
sip
this
beer
all
day
every
day
i
have
to
admit
that
i
rarely
go
for
this
beer
instead
usually
opting
for
hennepin
or
ommegang
i
really
wish
they
would
release
the
cave
aged
beers
more
as
i
think
i
can
tell
a
difference
all
in
all
this
is
a
sensational
brew
that
has
multiple
layers
of
complexity
i
have
had
a
lot
of
the
top
rated
quads
out
there
and
this
one
still
sits
close
to
the
top
cheers
quite
a
nice
brew
and
my
first
from
ommegang
i
cant
say
ive
ever
had
a
quad
with
so
many
lambic
elements
but
its
a
good
uniqueness
and
the
fruit
is
prominent
in
the
brew
without
being
saccharine
or
overtaking
all
the
other
elements
alcohol
is
well
hidden
too
it
doesnt
taste
like
a
9
8
abv
brew
would
buy
again
and
would
like
to
add
one
to
storage
for
sure
d
a
quality
after
dinner
beer
right
about
now
im
wishing
id
sliced
up
some
gouda
and
a
few
pieces
of
dark
chocolate
good
thing
i
have
a
couple
more
of
these
so
i
can
try
out
that
combination
i
think
ill
even
cellar
one
of
my
remaining
bottles
and
see
how
this
tastes
another
year
from
now
though
i
should
also
probably
grab
a
2009
vintage
to
compare
a
fresh
one
to
the
2008
overall
a
very
nice
quad
easy
drinking
i
loved
the
cherry
flavors
in
this
beer
i
split
this
bottle
but
i
think
i
could
drink
this
over
the
course
of
an
hour
or
two
another
hit
from
ommegang
d
this
is
a
serious
brew
at
9
8
abv
and
is
so
easy
to
drink
i
fell
in
love
with
this
a
long
time
ago
and
its
still
great
today
i
could
drink
as
many
as
it
took
for
me
to
not
be
able
to
drink
anymore
but
i
wouldnt
ever
do
that
because
i
respect
beer
lol
drinkability
my
favorite
from
the
brewery
so
far
it
made
me
think
i
was
drinking
a
cherry
cordial
with
a
bit
of
funk
i
could
have
several
if
not
for
the
high
abv
glad
i
bought
the
bomber
ommefest
on
tap
ive
ever
only
had
this
on
tap
but
cant
wait
to
open
my
07
at
home
pours
dark
with
a
malty
cheery
chocolate
nose
and
follows
straight
up
on
the
pallet
very
complex
and
a
great
desert
beer
with
dark
chocolates
its
one
of
those
beers
i
cant
wait
to
see
in
5
years
so
damn
great
my
favorite
ommegang
d
a
great
quad
that
is
made
even
better
by
the
addition
of
kriek
crisp
refreshing
with
that
sour
bite
just
at
the
end
great
stuff
this
one
is
pretty
damn
drinkable
it
was
also
my
test
bottle
to
see
if
i
invest
in
the
mini
vertical
i
stumbled
upon
looks
like
that
got
a
green
light
d
definitely
not
a
session
beer
but
great
beer
because
of
its
taste
and
complexity
drinkability
very
high
drinkability
this
pours
a
hazy
orange
and
brown
once
out
of
the
glass
the
head
is
not
billowy
but
sticks
around
till
the
end
it
has
a
sour
cherry
smell
from
the
lambic
that
is
used
with
a
little
chocolate
mixed
in
i
pick
up
a
malt
bread
chocolate
cherry
and
caramel
it
has
a
nice
long
finish
note
at
2
years
the
2
cherry
ale
really
begins
to
stand
out
i
should
buy
this
more
often
taste
slick
fruity
minty
and
malty
in
my
opinion
its
kind
of
tastes
like
a
scotch
ale
thats
been
fruited
poured
a
hazy
deep
brown
color
it
has
a
highly
carbonated
head
that
dissipates
quickly
the
aroma
contains
light
hints
of
malt
and
fruit
on
the
front
end
of
the
first
sip
immediately
noticed
the
higher
carbonation
of
the
beer
the
flavor
has
a
malty
sweetness
with
a
slight
cherry
flavor
the
alcohol
is
slightly
noticeable
overall
a
decent
beer
i
was
hoping
for
a
little
more
but
definitely
something
i
will
get
again
look
forward
to
trying
more
quads
as
i
have
only
had
a
few
drinkability
is
very
nice
have
no
problem
putting
away
a
750
drinkability
remains
pleasant
but
clearly
not
as
easy
as
others
even
among
strong
beers
of
comparable
abv
d
very
drinkable
the
alcohol
is
well
masked
with
a
multitude
of
flavors
overall
never
been
disappointed
from
ommegang
and
it
makes
me
proud
to
be
a
new
yorker
and
have
them
as
a
home
state
representation
is
a
homerun
hit
in
its
belgian
style
representation
and
as
a
whole
is
quite
delicious
and
really
is
an
example
of
a
perfected
craft
that
makes
craft
beer
what
its
known
for
overall
this
beer
could
be
one
of
my
alltime
favorites
if
it
was
able
to
finish
the
first
wave
of
taste
combined
with
the
mouthfeel
are
absolutely
fantastic
it
just
lacking
a
smooth
finish
the
alcohol
burn
is
a
little
much
but
not
enough
to
destroy
this
beer
drinkability
this
is
a
delicious
beer
but
definitely
a
sipper
extremely
tasty
but
it
suffers
in
this
category
from
its
strength
m
d
mouthfeel
was
creamy
and
smooth
with
a
medium
to
full
body
the
abv
and
cost
preclude
it
from
being
highly
drinkable
but
overall
this
is
a
solid
offering
from
brewery
ommegang
one
i
will
definitely
recommend
to
all
my
friends
notes
hmmm
this
is
a
good
approach
to
a
great
quad
but
for
me
it
falls
a
bit
short
of
the
extraordinary
a
bit
too
fizzy
and
unfortunately
in
my
palate
the
range
of
notes
that
would
make
it
really
memorable
do
not
show
up
better
than
most
us
attempts
at
the
style
ive
tried
but
still
not
reaching
the
source
of
original
inspiration
on
the
other
hand
the
type
of
quality
offered
by
ommegang
at
the
range
of
prices
compared
to
the
imports
is
tremendous
so
they
have
a
totally
deserved
spot
in
cellars
across
the
us
and
in
that
context
i
am
sure
ill
be
revisiting
sometimes
in
the
future
first
of
the
ommegang
beers
that
i
have
tried
the
others
are
soon
to
follow
3p
definately
lives
up
to
the
hype
that
surrounded
its
arrival
to
oklahoma
the
cherries
arent
exactly
my
thing
but
i
can
appreciate
this
beer
for
exactly
what
it
is
a
very
well
done
quad
with
a
unique
twist
on
tap
at
the
sierra
grille
amazing
beers
and
prices
pours
a
dark
blood
red
with
a
half
finger
head
that
leaves
almost
no
lacing
a
nice
cloud
coats
the
beer
smells
of
dark
fruits
malts
and
an
alcohol
bite
taste
is
dark
fruits
malts
citrus
raisins
alcohol
and
cherries
keep
coming
to
mind
mouth
feel
is
moderate
bodied
low
carbonation
a
good
warming
and
a
real
nice
oily
coat
of
flavor
on
the
tongue
drinkability
is
good
good
taste
decent
price
alcohol
may
kill
this
one
over
time
a
very
nice
twist
on
a
quad
d
a
great
beer
to
savour
can
go
on
and
on
nice
and
slow
this
is
a
big
favorite
would
reccomend
this
this
was
also
my
first
craft
beer
i
ever
drank
i
had
it
on
tap
on
my
birthday
ehhh
this
beer
was
extremely
overpriced
if
its
offered
to
you
for
free
i
wouldnt
say
no
to
it
however
i
wont
be
ordering
this
beer
again
rich
deep
mahogany
color
with
reddish
hues
and
lots
of
fat
sticky
lace
lots
of
malt
in
the
aroma
some
raisin
lots
of
dark
cherry
malted
very
rich
flavor
is
much
the
same
with
the
malted
cherries
taking
the
forefront
and
the
raisin
fig
notes
sticking
more
in
the
back
some
belgian
yeastiness
comes
through
but
its
faint
theres
just
a
lot
of
rich
malt
flavors
going
on
here
and
its
wonderful
id
only
expect
this
one
to
get
better
after
a
few
years
as
the
cherry
would
probably
round
out
and
the
raisin
notes
would
come
more
firmly
through
alcohol
is
not
detectable
notes
amazing
creaminess
with
warming
qualities
the
lacing
is
consistent
throughout
i
want
to
wait
a
few
months
until
its
cold
and
i
have
a
fire
going
to
retry
this
one
color
is
dark
brown
with
random
hues
of
red
poured
slowly
as
instructed
on
the
bottle
and
a
twofinger
dirty
white
head
appeared
quickly
and
skeddadled
a
few
fat
fingers
of
lace
jut
upwards
and
a
few
dots
speckle
the
perimeter
of
the
glass
the
complex
aroma
involves
big
dark
fruits
sweet
malts
grain
spice
and
bubblegum
closer
inspection
reveals
some
diacetyls
faint
hops
and
a
note
of
distant
caramel
taste
isnt
quite
as
complex
but
big
and
bold
just
the
same
with
a
graininess
up
front
followed
by
ripened
dark
fruit
cherries
and
plums
some
sour
fruit
a
welcomed
hop
hit
some
sweet
malts
and
spice
goes
slightly
rough
with
a
ubiquitous
alcohol
heat
which
never
bothers
me
its
a
bit
airy
with
a
good
amount
of
carbonation
and
the
mouthfeel
lies
right
between
medium
and
heavy
md
alcohol
comes
in
strong
fitting
to
the
style
carbonation
is
spot
on
medium
to
mediumfull
body
it
wont
be
among
my
personal
favorites
but
this
is
an
excellent
beer
nonetheless
d
a
750
went
down
easy
at
9
8
you
know
thats
a
good
beer
id
buy
this
again
and
while
this
beer
was
not
what
i
was
expecting
it
was
very
good
and
has
me
excited
for
future
ommegang
purchases
has
a
nice
mouthfeel
lasts
several
seconds
decent
drinkabiliyt
i
will
admit
i
am
not
the
biggest
quad
fan
but
compared
to
others
i
have
had
this
one
is
pretty
middleoftheroad
flavor
needs
more
refinement
and
the
alcohol
presence
needs
to
be
more
masked
probably
not
one
i
would
drink
again
i
recommend
it
if
you
are
a
big
belgian
quad
fan
if
not
then
you
might
want
to
pass
taste
is
very
complex
not
very
warming
but
a
bit
sharp
from
the
alcohol
the
taste
is
sour
and
a
bit
sweet
from
the
cherries
but
not
too
harsh
very
good
for
someone
trying
to
get
into
sours
there
are
also
some
oaky
and
woody
notes
to
it
reminds
me
of
bourbon
nice
amount
of
carbonation
for
a
quad
this
is
really
drinkable
and
quite
smooth
for
such
a
complex
beer
overall
a
good
beer
perhaps
a
bit
too
alcoholic
for
my
tastes
but
quite
drinkable
all
the
same
as
you
work
through
the
bottle
even
a
12
oz
er
it
gets
wearisome
a
truly
great
beer
that
represents
a
compromise
between
tradition
and
innovation
and
pulls
it
off
with
aplomb
i
only
got
one
to
try
but
would
buy
it
again
in
a
heartbeat
this
is
easily
one
of
my
favorite
beers
drinkability
suffers
because
after
a
while
the
flavor
begins
to
get
boring
and
it
becomes
a
task
to
finish
the
bottle
not
a
bad
quad
by
any
stretch
of
the
imagination
but
not
one
that
i
will
be
seeking
again
cheers
d
even
with
the
higher
abv
enjoyed
this
quite
a
bit
and
look
forward
to
the
next
one
poured
deep
dark
coppery
brown
with
a
slight
red
hint
around
the
edges
of
the
glass
the
thick
head
was
a
bit
fleeting
but
laced
my
glass
nicely
spicy
belgian
yeast
smell
with
sour
cherries
in
the
background
nice
alcohol
and
cherry
flavor
at
first
then
you
get
the
bready
sweet
malts
damn
this
stuff
is
good
very
drinkable
despite
the
abv
luckily
i
only
had
one
750
because
if
more
was
at
my
disposal
it
would
have
been
downed
as
well
definitely
a
sipper
but
no
problem
finishing
a
bottle
solo
very
tastey
with
a
complex
variety
of
dark
fruits
d
a
sipper
but
a
lovely
flavorful
beer
to
experience
i
would
definitely
have
this
one
again
drinkability
is
exceptional
i
could
easily
stick
with
this
the
whole
night
pours
a
dark
amber
brownish
color
with
a
little
one
finger
head
that
gave
way
to
some
lacing
the
smell
is
of
black
cherries
and
sweet
roasted
malts
the
taste
is
a
strong
malt
backbone
with
black
cherries
overriding
the
malt
at
the
tail
end
there
is
also
an
alcohol
taste
from
middle
to
end
there
is
a
good
deal
of
bitterness
that
starts
at
the
beginning
and
is
present
throughout
the
mouthfeel
is
a
little
slick
and
oily
with
a
low
to
moderate
carbonation
not
as
high
as
i
would
have
thought
this
beer
is
below
average
on
drinkablility
it
is
very
strong
and
a
little
overpowering
in
the
middle
this
is

what
this

with

was

there

this
is
not
the
beer
for
me
but
i
would
recommend
it
to
anyone
who
like
a
good
fruity
beer
and
ends
together
in
an
sour
malt
everything
seems
to
compliment
each
other
in
what
is
a
very
different
and
very
good
beer

and
this
is
a

the
beer
is

it
possesses
a

and
balanced
bouquet
that
far
surpasses
ommegangs
other

absolutely
love
this

have
a

on

get
a

ive
had
this
both
fresh

then
lightly
aged
after

the
alcohol
flavors

aromas
tend
to
subside
and
not
be

still
noticeable
i
love
how
the

are

let

that

dont

three
philosophers
should
call
itself

i

mouthfeel
and

are

with
the
style
these
are
i
think
the
toughest
to
rate
for
this
style
d
as
mentioned
above
a
unique
taste
thats
hearty
and
rich
this
might
make
a
good
dessert
beer
but
certainly
not
one
to
start
off
the
night
this
is
one
complex
brew
very
smooth
a
dessert
beer
to
just
sip
and
enjoy
ill
make
room
for
this
brew
more
often
pours
a
reddish
brown
with
a
tall
white
foamy
head
smells
sweet
with
cherry
notes
and
some
alcohol
tones
also
has
some
yeasty
characteristics
the
flavor
is
pretty
similar
with
the
alcohol
and
cherry
coming
through
at
first
with
the
yeasty
notes
to
follow
it
has
a
smooth
taste
with
good
carbonation
it
has
a
decent
drinkablilty
but
high
abv
which
makes
this
hard
to
have
more
than
a
few
this
is
worth
checking
out

sealed
with
a

and
wire
cage
served
in
a
belgian
chalice
pretty
good
but
just
seemed
to
be
missing
something
i
certainly
would
not
turn
one
down
but
i
wouldnt
go
looking
for
it
again
either
great
complexity
smooth
as
all
hell
i
really
enjoyed
this
one
and
will
pick
some
more
up
soon
a
little
bit
of
alcohol
heat
on
the
finish
d
quite
strong
the
taste
was
ever
so
slightly
subdued
which
i
believe
actually
promotes
its
drinkability
i
would
drink
it
again
if
given
the
opportunity
copper
to
red
in
color
with
a
nice
two
finger
head
in
the
body
a
glimpse
of
sediment
floats
around
smell
reminds
me
of
black
licorish
yeast
spice
and
cherries
the
first
thing
you
think
when
this
beer
hits
your
tongue
is
how
much
cherry
is
in
the
flavor
the
beer
actually
has
a
bit
of
cherry
lambic
mixed
into
the
receipe
but
it
sometimes
became
cloying
more
black
licorish
with
touhes
of
bourbon
and
banana
a
sweet
treat
to
end
my
night
d
a
very
interesting
experiment
of
a
beer
and
certainly
worth
a
try
i
enjoyed
it
but
not
as
much
as
id
enjoyed
pure
quads
in
the
past
d
although
i
was
expecting
something
bolder
stronger
this
is
a
very
satisfying
quad
particularly
for
those
that
prefer
a
less
sweet
less
heavy
dark
belgian
id
love
to
try
this
on
tap
the
mouthfeel
is
good
but
would
be
better
if
the
carbonation
was
toned
down
a
touch
the
carbonation
is
more
prickly
when
it
first
enters
your
mouth
and
then
becomes
softer
as
you
hold
it
in
your
mouth
it
is
full
bodied
this
brew
opens
with
a
torrent
of
foam
ebbing
out
of
the
bottle
the
beer
pours
a
clear
brownishred
color
with
a
thick
rocky
light
tan
head
the
aroma
is
of
prunes
dates
and
cherries
the
taste
is
of
dates
prunes
caramel
malt
and
has
a
hint
of
cherry
the
mouthfeel
is
full
bodied
with
a
high
level
of
fine
carbonation
overall
this
is
a
nice
brew
and
perhaps
the
best
american
made
quadrupel
i
have
yet
had
d
a
bit
much
for
more
then
one
pint
at
a
pop
but
oh
what
a
pint
very
good
quad
goes
down
smooth
and
leaves
you
with
something
to
ponder
i
have
seen
ommegang
beers
in
my
local
wegmans
for
quite
some
time
now
and
just
passed
them
by
this
may
be
due
to
their
obscure
location
in
the
cooler
or
maybe
my
unwillingness
to
explore
outside
of
the
standard
12oz
and
pint
servings
of
beer
my
friend
turned
me
on
to
this
company
and
wow
is
this
beer
amazing
no
its
not
the
every
day
drinking
beer
but
rather
something
you
can
sit
down
and
enjoy
a
bottle
of
with
a
friend
it
also
goes
great
with
a
cigar
as
the
potent
aroma
and
taste
still
make
their
way
through
the
smoke
to
your
taste
buds
in
the
same
way
that
good
scotch
is
great
after
being
aged
this
beer
gets
better
and
more
flavorful
with
age
only
downside
really
is
its
a
bit
gassy
of
a
beer
poured
out
of
a
2005
corked
and
caged
750ml
bottle
the
color
is
a
deep
brown
with
ruby
highlights
a
fantastic
tan
head
that
took
its
time
dissipating
some
spotty
lacing
left
on
the
glass
the
smell
is
of
dark
cherries
figs
carob
the
taste
has
a
big
cherry
hit
due
to
the
added
lambic
the
sweetness
is
offset
with
a
nice
roasted
malt
backbone
has
hints
of
tobacco
maybe
just
a
hair
too
sweet
this
is
a
very
flavorful
brew
the
feel
is
well
carbonated
and
well
bodied
the
drinkability
is
scary
with
the
9
8
abv
this
goes
down
way
easy
ommegang
hit
it
out
of
the
park
with
their
quad
d
this
one
actually
surprised
me
on
how
much
i
liked
it
every
other
ommegang
i
havent
been
a
fan
of
at
all
this
one
is
really
tasty
and
can
see
myself
buying
it
again
when
i
am
finally
out
of
quads
all
in
alll
a
very
drinkable
brew
i
dont
think
id
undertake
more
than
1
of
the
larger
bottles
at
time
im
looking
forward
to
picking
up
a
4
pack
of
the
12
oz
bottles
so
i
could
include
a
smaller
portion
in
an
evening
of
multiple
delights
very
glad
a
friend
from
cooperstown
introduced
this
to
me
this
is
quite
possibly
the
best
beer
i
have
ever
had
beautiful
redddish
brown
with
a
wheaten
colored
head
smells
like

and
toffee
very
nice
the
taste
is
fruity
upfront
but
leads
up
to
nice
complexity
sweetness
mixes
with
roasted
notes
and
tofee
flavors
round
out
a
sharpness
the
finish
is
slightly
warming
in
the
chest
very
nice
extremely
drinkable
a
few
members
have
described
as
luxurious
in
new
hampshire
we
would
said
this
kicks
major
ass
great
brew
i
am
not
the
biggest
quad
fan
but
i
do
appreciate
a
good
one
when
i
come
across
it
the
biggest
problem
i
had
with
this
one
was
the
addition
of
cherry
iambic
this
seemed
to
enhance
the
already
existing
sweetness
to
a
level
too
high
for
me
it
was
also
a
bit
too
carbonated
for
my
taste
i
did
appreciate
the
warmth
of
the
alcohol
and
its
beautiful
ruby
red
appearance
definitely
not
a
bad
beer
better
than
many
but
there
are
quads
i
prefer
incredibly
complexambiguous
beer
would
almost
certainly
due
well
with
cellaring
d
this
beer
can
be
described
in
one
word
luxurious
very
complex
tasty
beer
that
will
leave
few
dissatisfied
definitely
worth
a
try
beer
poured
a
decent
brown
color
into
my
schlitz
chalice
not
much
head
aroma
is
very
strong
malty
with
definite
raisin
smell
to
it
a
bit
of
chocolate
essence
but
not
much
taste
is
very
strong
with
a
coffeecaramel
essence
and
alcohol
in
the
background
the
alcohol
is
subdued
here
which
is
nice
i
really
like
the
taste
though
its
also
roasty
with
a
black
coffee
edge
to
it
yum
this
is
one
of
the
more
disappointing
quads
ive
had
you
should
definitely
spend
a
couple
more
dollars
to
get
the
good
stuff
if
youre
in
the
market
very
enjoyable
ill
buy
it
again
as
an
excellent
and
cheaper
alternative
to
more
expensive
belgian
style
beers
a
little
lambic
tartness
evident
in
the
nose
otherwise
sweet
and
boozy
with
background
grain
in
the
mouth
rather
thin
with
pretty
obvious
strength
a
bit
of
cola
bite
some
medicinaltea
bitterness
some
dark
cherry
and
then
little
hints
of
malt
action
but
not
all
that
much
not
objectionable
but
i
think
i
was
hoping
for
more
a
smooth
texture
is
lightened
significantly
by
a
mellow
epervesent
carbonation
very
complex
in
flavor
and
high
in
drinkability
better
than
i
expected
an
awesome
beer
pours
a
murky
nutty
brown
with
just
the
vaguest
of
amber
highlights
along
with
an
offwhite
dusting
of
a
head
aromas
of
bitter
chocolate
dark
candi
sugar
pear
and
cherry
fruits
and
some
yeast
on
the
palate
bitter
cherry
fruits
felt
on
the
sides
of
the
tongue
matched
by
figgy
malt
sweetness
before
a
dry
finish
mouthfeel
is
medium
bodied
with
fulsome
carbonation
overall
this
beer
is
better
than
i
remember
it
being
nice
fruit
rich
malts
high
abv
that
doesnt
burn
very
good
d
a
great
pleasure
for
my
taste
buds
sweet
strong
balanced
and
complex
a
great
example
of
a
hybrid
of
styles
done
with
inspiration
and
skill
a
superb
fruit
blend
with
quadruple
punch
not
gentle
in
heft
but
graceful
and
sophisticated
all
the
while
perhaps
the
most
drinkable
quad
i
have
had
versatile
to
the
extreme
could
be
poured
and
enjoyed
with
desserts
or
a
variety
of
main
courses
a
really
delicious
brew
that
can
be
enjoyed
easily
all
by
itself
this
is
a
very
wine
like
beer
i
think
it
it
would
be
a
suprise
to
those
sad
folks
who
hate
beer
and
like
wine
especially
darker
earthier
wines
this
is
a
very
good
and
suprising
beer
drinkability
takes
a
hit
but
its
extremely
good
not
as
attenuated
as
something
like
rochefort
10
but
is
still
very
digestable
i
remember
the
taste
of
this
beer
being
more
bright
i
think
with
time
and
poor
storage
the
beer
seems
to
have
take
a
dull
like
quality
still
very
good
though
three
philosophers
pours
like
dark
ambermaple
syrup
and
while
sipping
it
its
almost
as
thick
about
the
only
beer
ive
had
which
is
thicker
would
be
various
barleywines
the
aroma
is
complementary
to
the
flavor
in
that
you
get
a
hint
of
the
cherries
but
it
comes
out
when
sipping
it
i
say
sipping
it
because
its
kind
of
like
a
bourbon
too
strong
to
quaff
but
the
characteristics
come
out
when
sipping
it
its
quite
sweet
which
means
that
its
hard
to
drink
a
lot
of
it
but
somehow
it
leaves
me
wanting
more
anyway
this
is
an
incredibly
tasty
and
well
made
brew
barely
being
able
to
perceive
the
alcohol
makes
a
brew
this
tasty
dangerously
drinkable
drinkability
is
good
this
is
a
nice
and
interesting
quadrupel
fairly
easy
to
drink
especially
at

and
a
half
an
inch
of

smells
like

roasty

tastes
like

caramel
with
a
bit
of
a
woody
character
full
creamy
mouthfeel
with
a
fair
bit
of

very
well
balanced
and
extremely
drinkable
by

away
one
of
the
finest
beers
i
have
ever
had
the
pleasure
of
having
and
the
best
quad
i
have
ever
had
practically
perfect
in
every
way
overall
its
a
very
good
brew
im
not
disappointed
but
i
dont
know
if
id
pick
this
up
again
it
was
good
just
nothing
that
overly
impressed
me
it
pretty
much
tastes
exactly
like
it
should
like
a
belgian
that
had
some
cherry
lambic
added
to
it
i
think
id
be
more
happy
to
just
have
the
quadruple
part
of
the
beer
and
skip
the
cherry
lambic
might
be
something
good
to
serve
to
someone
who
doesnt
really
like
beer
who
usually
sticks
to
wines
or
sweeter
drinks
pours
a
quite
dark

colour
very
smooth
has
a
nice
amount
of
bitters
has
a
regal
sweetness
to
it

quadrific
cherries
add
a

twist

for

and
it
didnt
really
disappoint

edit
about
a
month
and
a
half
ago
i
had
a
cave
aged
bottle
of
three
philosophers
2006
vintage
and
it
was
absolutely
incredible
so
smooth
so
tasty
today
im
enjoying
a
bottle
2005
vintage
that
has
been
in
my
own
cellar
for
about
9
months
and
it
too
has
smoothed
out
and
is
really
nicce
negligible
tartness
and
a
smoother
more
pleasant
cherry
flavor
ratings
have
been
upgraded
accordingly
this
is
a
great
brew
with
some
age
on
it
an
okay
attempt
at
a
belgian
ale
flavor
is
pretty
lacking
but
its
not
bad
i
was
just
hoping
for
something
more
worth
trying
if
youre
curious
poured
from
12
oz
bottle
to
chalice
with
a
rich
dark
plumlike
appearance
with
a
large
head
and
very
nice
retention
the
smell
of
good
trademark
quadrupel
spices
with
a
light
cherry
scent
the
taste
begins
with
a
thin
mixing
of
the
contents
spicy
yet
smooth
with
rich
thick
dark
cherry
finish
interesting
how
the
cherries
are
light
in
the
scent
but
strong
and
dark
in
the
taste
the
mouthfeel
is
incredibly
thick
and
creamy
chewy
enough
to
bite
down
into
a
good
sipper
but
the
dark
cherry
aftertaste
puts
a
very
slight
damper
on
the
drinkability
but
not
enough
to
keep
me
from
going
for
this
one
on
several
occasions
wonderfully
complex
and
drinkable
beer
i
would
love
to
see
this
on
cask
and
if
i
can
put
it
down
ill
save
a
bottle
or
two
for
next
winter
this
was
just
luscious
a
beauty
in
every
respect
a
true
malt
lovers
brew
and
as
close
as
you
can
get
to
a
great
holiday
dessert
in
liquid
form
outstanding
will
definitely
keep
a
bottle
or
two
around
for
special
meals
or
a
great
treat
highly
recommended
d
a
beautiful
brew
to
behold
and
quite
complex
a
dinner
beer
that
is
to
be
sipped
and
enjoyed
tastes
flourish
was
the
beer
warms
highly
recommended
ddangerously
good
for
the
this
one
is
a
winner
and
one
i
will
revisit
especially
with
fresh
direct
delivering
brewed
in
2005

750
ml
bottle
color
of
deep
reddish
mahogany
with
a
thick
frothy
tan
head
nose
of
malt
dark
cherries
white
flowers
and
assorted
red
fruit

taste
of
deep
red
cherries
bitter
chocolate
roasted
dried
apricots
slightly
sour
and
milky
body
is
medium
and
well
carbonated

aftertaste
of
sweet
sour
red
fruit
berries
and
hints
of
chocolate
on
the
palate
it
is
not
as
complex
as
i
recall
from
an
ontap
serving
i
had
last
year
rich
and
malty
fairly
sweet
but
not
cloying
a
solid
example
of
a
dark
brown
belgian
ale
but
doesnt
thrill
me
at
least
its
cheaper
than
an
import
the
bottom
line
not
a
bad
blend
but
i
think
i
would
rather
have
a
straight
quad
or
a
straight
cherry
lambic
poured
a
dark
reddish
amber
great
fizzy
dissipating
head
with
sticky
lace
as
an
after
effect
nice
yeasty
aromas
dominate
some
fruity
malts
a
hint
of
spice
notable
belgian
yeast
flavors
fresh
berries
and
sticky
malts
at
first
taste
extremely
well
carbonated
and
dry
like
an
expensive
champagne
mild
hops
come
through
in
the
finish
along
with
a
yeasty
sourness
that
evens
out
the
sweetness
interesting
blend
the
quad
style
mixes
well
with
the
lambic
berry
flavors
a
very
refreshing
brew
with
a
deceptively
high
abv
not
my
pick
for
ommegangs
best
but
well
worth
a
try
d
this
is
a
fasinating
beer
i
love
the
kriek
taste
added
to
a
quadrupel
definitely
worth
a
try
if
youre
a
fan
of
quads
and
even
if
youre
not
its
still
worth
a
try
750
ml
bottle
brewed
in
2005
served
in
a
chalice
the
beer
pours
a
reddishcopper
color
with
a
small
tan
head
it
smells
like
cherries
pepper
and
other
dark
fruit
the
aroma
wasnt
very
strong
it
tastes
spicy
pepper
and
cloves
and
like
cherries
herbs
caramel
and
dark
fruit
finishes
bitter
peppery
and
sour
and
a
bit
dry
with
some
alcohol
warming
too
mouthfeel
is
medium
with
a
lot
of
carbonation
its
also
a
little
bit
slick
drinkability
is
ok
but
would
be
better
if
the
carbonation
was
lower
overall
i
think
its
good
but
i
wasnt
impressed
with
this
beer
that
being
said
id
try
it
again
in
the
future
but
i
wouldnt
go
out
of
my
way
to
buy
it
this
one
may
just
be
to
overly
complex
to
make
it
a
session
beer
its
not
the
9
8
abv
that
scares
me
ive
had
much
higher
and
have
made
a
session
out
of
them
i
think
this
one
is
just
a
tad
to
complicated
for
my
taste
bubs
to
make
me
yearn
for
more
than
one
highly
recommended
a
wonderful
take
on
the
quad
style
and
by
an
american
brewer
no
less
id
love
to
see
some
more
quads
blend
in
a
bit
of
kriek
adds
a
nice
dimension
disappointing
i
have
been
looking
forward
to
this
beer
and
was
happy
to
hear
it
had
landed
in
texas
it
could
be
a
good
beer
imo
it
just
needs
more
attention
to
fermentation
of
the
base
98
beer
and
blending
a
great
sipping
beer
not
for
everyone
an
acquired
taste
but
a
wonderful
selection
for
those
who
enjoy
belgian
beers
highly
enjoyable
a
wonderful
quad
and
the
cherries
only
add
a
nice
fruit
complexity
americans
can
brew
belgians
ultra
complex
and
a
thrill
to
drink
the
cherry
lambic
adds
a
little
tartness
to
the
overall
sweet
and
smooth
drink
enjoy
with
someone
else
as
this
one
is
a
bit
heavy
this
one
sips
pretty
light
but
burns
going
down
until
about
mid
glass
i
cant
picture
drinking
this
regularly
its
a
flavor
experience
but
one
i
would
take
in
moderation
now
i
usually
dont
go
talking
about
prices
for
beers
but
at
five
bucks
a
pop
this
is
just
an
unbelievable
deal
and
now
that
my
ommegang
stash
is
winding
down
ill
have
to
jump
over
to
sconnie
to
grab
some
more
d
pretty
good
while
not
in
love
i
do
enjoy
it
which
is
good
since
the
afformentioned
friend
loves
it
the
alcohol
needs
to
tone
down
a
bit
perhaps
go
sit
in
the
corner
and
think
about
what
hes
done
i
have
only
had
a
few
quadrupels
but
this
american
brew
held
its
own
with
its
belgian
counterparts
if
it
was
not
7
per
bottle
i
would
have
one
everyday
this
beer
poured
a
cloudy
brown
color
with
at
thick
head
and
pretty
lacing
the
smell
is
a
bit
sour
and
perhaps
malty
the
taste
is
malty
with
definite
sour
and
sweet
notes

a
hint
of
fruitiness
the
mouthfeel
is
full
but
not
chewy
overall
this
is
a
well
balanced
ale
that
id
recommend
high
means
its
not
a
session
brew
but
it
is
still
a
very
nice
quad
and
worthy
of
another
go
in
the
near
future
drinkability
lacking
in
complexity
i
thought
but
good
overall
if
you
know
what
youre
getting
into
i
can
hardly
stand
to
finish
just
one
for
those
who
like
sweet
fruity
beers
this
is
for
you
but
it
isnt
my
cup
of
tea
nor
it
is
a
good
quad
it
is
far
to
sweet
fruity
and
artificial
contrived
is
a
good
word
to
describe
it
give
me
a
real
quad
like
rochefort
10
st
bernardus
12
or
any
other
quad
out
there
this
cant
even
being
to
approach
them
d
excellent
except
for
the
price
my
parents
got
this
for
me
as
a
gift
and
they
paid
eight
or
nie
bucks
for
the
big
bottle
honestly
this
is
good
stuff
but
i
wouldnt
buy
it
again
for
this
price
overall
very
nice
highly
recommended
to
fans
of
belgianstyle
ales
also
good
for
cherry
fans
who
are
put
off
by
sour
ales
this
is
a
popular
ale
in
my
house
and
i
will
definitely
be
picking
it
up
again
poured
into
a
goblet
a
rich
dark
amber
almost
brown
with
ruby
highlights
when
held
up
to
the
light
there
was
a
beautiful
twofinger
head
that
was
slow
diminish
and
left
great
lacing
on
the
glass
the
aroma
was
very
strong
of
cherries
and
carbondioxide
almost
like
cheerwine
taste
was
absolutely
wonderful
the
vibrant
cherry
flavor
was
accented
with
a
complex
malt
flavor
and
very
subtle
hops
that
were
almost
unnoticeable
but
they
did
their
job
this
beer
was
vibrantly
carbonated
once
again
almost
feels
like
cheerwine
in
the
mouth
it
is
very
hard
to
tell
that
this
is
9
8
alcohol
id
have
to
say
this
is
almost
certainly
my
favorite
beer
made
with
fruit
very
enjoyable
any
time
of
year
my
favorite
beer
strong
yet
sensitive
brash
yet
reluctant
a
high
alcohol
beer
strong
on
malts
and
hops
but
also
a
very
strong
dark
cherry
aftertaste
leaves
the
mouth
feeling
refreshed
but
also
wanting
a
little
more
pours
a
dark
redmahogany
you
only
need
one
for
a
night
if
that
it
is
heavy
and
filling
but
the
taste
is
very
complex
and
surprisingly
smooth
a
pretty
decent
beer
in
the
end
but
would
need
a
good
reason
to
drink
it
again
maybe
with
a
good
food
pairing
d
a
little
too
sweet
to
want
a
lot
of
this
but
overall
a
very
nice
brew
poured
from
a
12oz
bottle
into
a
snifter
glass
appears
a
dark
mahogany
with
a
finger
of
dark
tan
foam
smells
of
dried
fruits
and
sweet
caramel
malt
tastes
of
dried
sweet
dark
fruits
such
as
cherry
and
plum
spicy
notes
and
then
the
sweet
malt
comes
through
moderate
carbonation
and
slightly
heavy
on
the
tongue
this
is
a
great
dessert
beer
one
of
the
best
definitely
one
to
sip
cheers
shared
the
750

bread
overall
smells
like
a
delicious
apple
crumble
or
apple
pie
tastes
of
the
apple
with
tangy
cherry
in
the
center
and
aftertaste
i
really
enjoy
the
addition
of
the
cherry
lambic
to
the
quadrupel
it
complements
the
apple
and
sugar
flavors
without
overpowering
them
good
thickness
to
the
mouthfeel
like
a
thick
cider
overall
a
wonderful
beer
lots
of
light
complex
flavors
and
aromas
would
gladly
buy
another
for
my
friend
so
i
could
split
it
with
him
just
kidding
poured
from
a
2005
750ml
bottle
into
an
ommegang
cervoise
the
quad
is
a
deep
mahogany
that
has
a
bottled
conditioned
cloudiness
although
i
didnt
purposely
swirl
the
yeast
a
vigorous
pour
produced
a
large
tan
head
with
medium
bubbles
that
quickly
subsided
to
a
1
finger
collar
leaving
some
thick
sticky
lace
the
aroma
is
very
rich
and
complex
earthy
and
vinous
and
mainly
sour
cherries
the
taste
is
sweet
rich
malt
caramel
prunes
and
yeast
reminiscent
of
gulden
drak
but
with
a
very
pleasant
tartness
from
the
cherry
lambic
and
brett
that
really
takes
it
to
the
next
level
before
fading
to
a
boozy
and
slightly
dry
finish
the
3
philosophers
had
a
moderate
mouthfeel
and
a
great
flavor
profile
that
takes
a
while
to
unlock
but
is
a
bit
rich
to
drink
more
then
a
bottle
or
too
of
that
said
it
is
choice
for
enjoying
with
a
robust
cigar
such
as
a
romeo
y
julieta
reserva
real
2
belicoso
which
is
suburb
a
bit
of
a
poor
mans
st
bernardus
abt
12
but
at
a
pretty
nice
price
for
a
decent
quadrupel
d
wonderful
will
have
again
cheers
drinkability
i
would
love
to
bring
this
with
me
to
a
bring
your
own
restaurant
this
easily
takes
the
place
of
a
wine
when
accompanied
by
any
high
end
meat
beautiful
for
long
romantic
nights
or
a
very
quiet
elegant
sitting
really
is
a
mood
maker
ill
buy
it
again
when
i
have
an
occasion
for
it
excellent
excellent
beer
tried
it
on
a
whim
at
rfd
in
downtown
dc
saw
it
listed
on
tap
and
selected
it
because
it
was
the
most
expensive
one
on
the
menu
was
pleasantly
surprised
it
was
very
smooth
and
rich
complex
in
taste
with
lots
of
sugar
caramel
apple
pepper
honey
cinnamon
and
anise
coming
through
had
another
glass
just
to
make
sure
i
liked
it
as
much
as
i
had
initially
thought
and
oh
yeah
its
an
excellent
excellent
beer
makes
a
great
afternoon
by
sitting
around
sipping
the
whole
bottle
i
am
new
to
this
site
and
also
to
the
art
of
beer
reviewing
so
please
forgive
this
review
if
it
is
a
bit
rudimentary
three
philos
quite
simply
is
outstanding
it
is
a
full
bodied
dark
and
very
tasty
this
brew
also
packs
a
10abv
punch
so
be
careful
it
tastes
so
good
you
tend
not
to
realize
that
once
glass
of
this
potion
equals
about
3
of
your
domestic
beers
the
main
reason
this
beer
strikes
my
fancy
is
the
intense
taste
that
it
brings
to
the
table
its
not
something
that
you
can
just
drink
and
not
give
it
a
second
thought
it
makes
you
stop
to
realize
the
quality
of
beverage
that
is
flooding
your
palate
it
makes
you
sit
up
and
recognize
that
this
is
not
just
another
beer
thats
all
for
now
this
bottle
has
been
preserved
very
well
i
would
prefer
all
my
3
philos
to
have
a
few
years
on
them
d
this
is
my
first
time
trying
an
entire
bottle
of
this
and
as
expected
ommegang
nailed
it
again
i
consider
them
a
great
alternative
to
wine
for
those
special
occasions
but
they
also
make
for
a
great
relaxation
beer
i
sampled
this
one
after
a
pretty
rough
day
at
work
when
i
just
wanted
to
relax
an
excellent
quad
from
a
great
brewery
im
going
to
pick
up
some
more
to
cellar
them
because
im
sure
this
ages
beautifully
drinkability
this
is
9
8
abv
cannot
taste
the
alcohol
at
all
the
mixing
of
the
cherry
lambic
and
quad
makes
for
an
interesting
and
nice
flavor
different
tastes
dart
in
all
over
in
flashes
some
of
which
stay
for
awhile
in
the
long
lingering
finish
complex
but
delicately
so
co2
level
seemed
to
be
just
right
for
this
brew
and
mouthfeel
was
smooth
and
very
drinkable
a
fantastic
quad
that
is
so
easy
to
acquire
i
cannot
believe
that
this
is
my
first
time
trying
it
d
good
it
is
a
very
enjoyable
quad
ive
had
it
before
and
i
will
have
it
again
if
someone
offered
me
a
12
oz
or
a
glass
of
this
beer
i
would
gladly
accept
but
nothing
more
id
like
to
revisit
this
beer
again
sometime
but
only
in
a
smaller
portion
drinkability
definetly
a
unique
brew
that
im
glad
i
tried
though
a
bit
too
strong
meaty
to
have
on
a
regular
basis
have
this
one
on
an
empty
stomach
as
it
is
very
filling
definetly
a
brew
all
serious
beer
drinkers
need
to
try
and
one
i
look
forward
to
trying
again
a
year
or
2
from
now
aroma
is
sweet
fruity
taste
is
malty
up
front
candy
like
slightly
cherry
good
medium
body
a
little
creamy
nice
dry
alchohol
finish
overall
this
is
a
pretty
good
brew
as
far
as
belgian
style
beers
go
though
there
are
many
that
are
better
worth
a
try
at
the
very
least
i
cant
recommend
this
enough
definitely
one
of
my
favorite
beers
and
probably
the
best
ive
reviewed
thus
far
for
complexity
and
versatility
you
cant
beat
this
you
really
cant
take
this
one
in
a
half
hour
need
to
pair
it
with
something
cheese
of
any
variety
i
think
will
do
cheers2beers
this
is
one
of
my
personal
favorites
and
i
usually
have
a
750ml
in
my
fridge
at
all
times
a
great
buy
if
you
get
a
chance
try
it
pours
a
deep
reddish
color
with
good
clarity
smell
is
sweet
malty
with
hints
of
cherry
flavor
suffers
from
an
excessive
sweetness
that
is
rather
cloying
this
was
a
2006
bottling
so
maybe
it
was
still
too
young
but
the
flavors
just
didnt
seem
to
meld
together
well
cheers
other
comments
a
nice
idea
for
ommegang
to
blend
one
of
their
belgianstyle
beers
with
a
true
belgian
beer
cherry
kriek
the
result
is
a
comforting
warming
flavorful
concoction
reminds
me
a
bit
of
rare
vos
from
the
cafe
of
the
same
name
in
schepdaal
belgium
in
october
2005
i
purchased
a
couple
mixed
cases
of
750
ml
bottles
of
each
of
ommegangs
four
main
beers
when
i
camped
overnight
at
the
waffles
and
puppets
event
most
of
those
beers
have
since
been
drunk
or
given
as
gifts
but
of
those
that
remain
there
are
three
specimens
of
the
2005
bottling
of
three
philosophers
belgian
style
blend
this
bottle
has
sat
quietly
with
its
ommegang
brethren
since
then
and
now
seems
like
a
good
time
for
a
review
the
bottle
was
opened
at
cellar
temperature
a
careful
pour
into
a
three
philosophers
bulb
yields
a
slightly
murky
burntorange
glowing
brew
with
a
steady
denselybubbled
light
brown
head
slightly
boozy
almost
medicinal
aromas
of
prunes
and
cherry
juice
along
with
brown
sugar
and
faint
cannedpineapple
notes
very
noticeable
cherry
flavor
rings
the
edges
of
the
first

surrounding
a
carameldrizzled
spiced

spicy

prickliness
subsides
toward
the
finish
clean

moderate

slickness
medium

the
year
and
change
this
has
spent
sitting
tight
in
the
cellar
has
brought
the
lindemans
kriek
out
from
the
shadows
or
maybe
ive
just
had
a
difficult
time
discerning
it
in
the
past
as
of
now
this
is
drinking
fine
but
ive
got
two
left
to
try
for
the
next
couple
of
years
and
it
should
be
interesting
to
see
what
additional
time
will
do
to
this
beer
its
drinkable
but
not
something
id
do
over
an
over
a
decent
beer
to
sip
on
for
a
while
drinkability
good
not
great
this
beer
puts
the
palate
through
the
wringer
glad
i
had
a
chance
to
sample
it
i
might
like
to
try
this
with
a
nice
fruit
tart
or
truffle
some
other
time
interesting
blend
of
two
completely
different
styles
of
belgian
beer
drinkability
drinkability
is
unmatched
this
beer
holds
its
own
exceptionally
well
but
it
would
mix
well
with
many
desserts
highly
reccommended
this
is
one
of
my
desert
island
beers
d
i
think
i
like
this
beer
more
fresh
opposed
to
aged
the
cherry
isnt
as
apparent
but
it
does
get
more
caramel
personality
regardless
delicious
so
drinkable
the
alcohol
is
well
hidden
except
for
the
buzz
one
750ml
and
im
not
driving
a
firetruck
anywhere
opened
this
now
to
celebrate
being
packed
and
ready
for
a
cruise
sailing
tomorrow
for
key
west
and
points
south
this
is
a
really
nice
beer
the
only
thing
that
slows
down
drinkability
is
the
alcohol
percentage
and
the
huge
bottle
i
enjoyed
the
flavors
and
complexities
of
this
beer
a
lot
however
the
lambic
blending
added
a
slightly
disjoint
set
of
flavors
that
while
good
would
have
been
much
better
had
they
blended
better
aroma
of
sweet
malt
coco
bitterness
some
spice
and
clove
hints
from
the
yeast
and
a
tart
cherry
fruitiness
a
firm
lasting
off
white
head
tops
the
brown
body
interlaced
with
red
highlights
malty
sweetness
up
front
followed
by
cherry
cough
syrup
and
a
hint
of
mustiness
left
a
candy
coating
in
my
mouth
a
interesting
beer
would
like
to
see
more
sourness
and
less
sweetness
though
drinkability
as
with
most
belgian
and
belgianstyles
this
bad
boy
is
for
sipping
anyone
who
thinks
they
can
drink
several
of
these
needs
to
drink
cheaper
beer
for
the
buzz
they
are
looking
for
this
is
a
well
presented
quadrupel
without
suffering
from
the
ofttimes
overbearing
alcohol
presence
one
of
my
favorates
in
the
style
this
is
a
wonderful
unique
brew
the
mixture
of
barley
malt
and
cherry
lambic
makes
this
one
interesting
and
delicious
as
the
bottle
states
this
one
is
better
to
have
when
at
room
temperature
or
slightly
chilled
its
a
very
nice
occassional
sipping
brew
let
me
finish
with
this
thought
this
beer
reminds
me
of
wine
a
very
dry
chard
with
hops
and
barley
not
a
barley
wine
not
that
sweet
i
would
like
to
revisit
this
thought
on
another
bottle
if
you
have
access
to
this
beer
it
is
a
must
try
this
will
be
a
regular
in
my
beer
rotation
drinkability
is
good
the
alcohol
is
hidden
well
and
its
interesting
and
tasty
very
enjoyable
quite
drinkable
refreshing
but
just
complicated
enough
to
keep
your
interest
d
a
very
tasty
quad
indeed
but
i
just
dont
see
where
the
cherries
come
in
perhaps
this
is
a
good
thing
however
since
an
overtly
cherry
smack
in
the
face
would
be
an
affront
to
the
style
a
pleasure
to
drink
and
satisfying
nonetheless
d
surprisingly
good
considering
how
rich
and
alcoholic
it
is
largely
thanks
to
the
rather
mellow
flavor
taste
is
immediately
alcoholic
with
the
sourish
cherry
flavour
coming
in
just
behind
this
is
a
little
more
tart
than
i
thought
it
would
be
but
i
like
it
the
cherries
give
way
to
a
mild
chocolate
sweetness
some
fruitcake
flavour
figs
plums
blackberries
all
make
an
appearance
along
with
a
hint
of
coriander
mild
yeastiness
in
here
as
well
theres
a
multitude
of
complexities
to
this
beer
very
impressive
mouthfeel
is
quite
creamy
and
it
leaves
the
palate
a
little
sticky
carbonation
is
medium
and
dances
the
flavours
around
the
palate
just
enough
drinkable
is
more
like
sippable
as
this
is
one
hefty
brew
and
i
could
keep
sipping
this
all
night
not
more
than
two
though
not
my
favorite
ommegang
offering
but
a
very
good
brew
nonetheless
dark
brown
in
color
with
mahogany

the
beer
is
topped
by
a
thin
fizzy
tan
colored
head
the
nose
has
lots
of
dark
fruit
blackberries
plums
dark
caramel
toffee
dates
and
the
lightest
hint
of
spice
there
is
a
light
citrus
finish
the
flavor
really
turns
up
the
dark
fruit
there
must
be
some
belgian
candy
syrup
in
this
beer
tons
and
tons
of
blackberry
blackcherry

light

bitterness
comes
across
midway
the

blends
the

and
the
bitterness
there
is
just
a
mils
alcohol
hint
on
the
finish
the
mouth
feel
is
just
a
touch
thin
overall
nice
beer
youre
not
going
to
knock
back
this
beer
its
too
heavy
too
alcoholic
and
too
bretty
savor
it
with
a
good
meal
and
a
lot
of
free
time
i
imagine
this
might
actually
be
a
good
introduction
to
belgian
yeast
and
even
lambic
as
the
brett
and
sourness
are
strong
but
balanced
nicely
by
the
quadrupelstyle
weight
its
kind
of
a
stouty
quad
to
me
it
tastes
pretty
good
but
i
dont
think
its
necesarilly
a
very
good
showing
for
the
style
a
good
dinner
beer
bottom
line
a
brew
i
appreciate
more
than
actually
enjoy
definitely
an
interesting
combo
and
a
good
one
at
that
however
i
prefer
my
quads
with
out
anything
extra
in
it
but
this
still
may
be
a
repeat
purchase
notesfirst
introduced
to
the
ommegang
line
at
a
beer
tasting
in
buffalo
ny
their
beers
are
excellent
belgian
stylesand
you
cant
beat
the
price
the
only
blended
quad
ive
had
and
it
was
interesting
to
same
the
least
i
poured
a
dark
brown
with
a
tinge
of
red
as
it
warms
the
sour
cherry
smell
really
comes
out
in
general
i
found
the
lambic
to
dominate
this
beer
losing
some
of
the
more
subtle
flavors
there
were
still
some
good
dark
fruit
flavors
but
id
prefer
more
focus
on
them
only
actual
negative
is
that
more
the
longest
time
the
beer
was
overcarbonated
to
the
point
of
making
it
hard
to
taste
paired
second
glass
with
cherry
pie
without
improvement
id
seen
this
beer
on
the
shelf
a
long
while
and
always
been
intrigued
by
the
idea
of
a
quad
with
blended
cherry
lambic
so
i
finally
caved
and
here
it
goes
poured
it
into
my
chimay
chalice
careful
not
to
disturb
the
sediment
nice
off
white
tan
head
with
good
retention
the
body
is
a
dark
coffee
brown
with
deep
reddish
highlights
it
smells
of
belgian
yeast
sweet
and
charred
malt
mild
hints
of
coffee
and
caramel
with
a
little
subtle
but
pleasing
natural
funk
of
lambic
the
taste
is
crisp
and
malty
some
definite
sweetness
coupled
with
a
mild
yet
well
balance
hint
of
hoppy
bitterness
and
the
cherry
lambic
funk
is
definitely
there
yet
not
over
pouring
in
the
least
if
one
dislikes
lambics
they
need
not
worry
this
is
not
a
100
funk
its
more
just
the
right
amount
for
a
great
all
round
flavor
this
beer
is
a
really
fun
modified
quad
honestly
the
flavor
of
cherry
lambic
and
charred
malt
with
caramel
coffee
and
chocolate
notes
makes
for
a
great
beer
id
definitely
buy
this
again
especially
to
show
it
to
a
friend
was
very
happy
to
find
this
one
almost
locally
will
be
a
staple
in
my
beer
cupboard
three
philosophers
was
an
enjoyable
beer
experience
i
need
to
revisit
what
brewery
ommegang
has
to
offer
since
i
reviewed
most
of
their
regular
offerings
prior
to
knowing
what
the
hell
i
was
tasting
still
though
its
hard
to
believe
that
anything
in
their
oeuvre
can
compare
to
three
philosophers
this
is
a
stunning
creation
that
was
a
steal
at
only
5
99
per
bottle
im
seriously
considering
buying
a
case
because
im
sure
that
this
nectar
will
age
like
a
dream
highly
recommended
this
is
a
powerful
and
quite
strong
beer
that
is
ultra
complex
if
you
dont
like
fullflavored
and
robust
beers
then
steer
clear
of
this
one
because
you
will
surely
cower
in
fear
at
its
awesome
power
a
must
have
for
those
who
love
lots
of
flavor
and
complexity
on
the
sweetish
side
but
i
think
it
was
still
too
powerful
of
a
brew
for
the
wifey
ill
have
another
thanks

charred

and

flavors
losses
some
of
its
carbonated
quality
towards
the
end
this
was
certainly
a
fairly
complex
beer
but
still
fell
short
of
expectation
still
very
good
but
not
as
good
as
my
first
bottle
overall
it
was
an
interesting
beer
the
bottle
size
allowed
it
to
warm
to
room
temperature
offering
a
variety
of
flavors
and
temperatures
to
take
in
the
hop
presence
was
surprising
but
not
offensive
excellent
beer
im
warm
and
happy
quite
good
overall
as
are
all
of
the
ommegang
products
ill
be
curious
to
see
how
the
other
bottle
turns
out
after
a
couple
years
in
the
cellar
has
a
nice
bubbly
texture
but
then
coats
the
mouth
with
some
unwelcome
astringency
that
aside
its
not
nearly
as
heavy
a
brew
as
id
expected
thus
if
its
to
your
taste
makes
for
a
pretty
drinkable
beverage
solid
but
not
worthy
of
regular
revisits
overall
a
terrific
quadrupel
and
an
outstanding
value
for
your
money
this
was
really
good
poured
from
the
bomber
to
a
reddish
brown
color
with
offwhite
head
that
lingered
and
left
very
good
lacing
aroma
was
strongly
cherry
with
malty
sweetness
evident
body
was
medium
and
at
first
highly
carbonated
taste
was
more
of
the
cherry
mixed
well
with
the
traditional
ale
taste
as
beer
warmed
the
alcohol
became
more
evident
in
the
nose
and
taste
but
still
well
blended
with
the
cherry
ale
excellent
warming
finish
as
the
alcohol
took
hold
and
a
very
smooth
aftertaste
i
will
look
for
more
of
this
in
the
coming
winter
this
beer
is
full
bodied
and
is
easy
to
drink
i
think
that
ill
definitely
try
this
one
again
i
want
to
see
if
i
have
the
same
experience
that
ive
had
with
this
one
this
beer
goes
down
very
well
theres
nothing
wrong
with
it
that
would
make
it
hard
to
drink
could
almost
drink
this
all
night
however
i
find
the
flavor
of
this
beer
to
be
more
bland
than
other
beers
ive
had
beers
that
i
would
rather
drink
all
night
all
in
all
its
above
average
and
i
like
it
but
in
the
way
of
quadrupel
i
prefer

poured
a
very
rich
dark
brown
with
ruby
hues
to
it
about
a
halfinch
head
that
dissipated
quickly
into
a
tiny
head
that
was
formed
just
around
the
circumfrence
of
the
galss
leaving
behind
very
little
lacing
smells
of
ripe
dark
fruits
cherries
figs
sweet
and
some
alcohol
taste
is
also
of
very
ripe
dark
fruits
figs
prunes
raisins
cherry
flavors
very
noticeable
alcohol
burn
in
the
finish
this
beer
could
mask
the
alcohol
better
but
i
guess
with
a
beer
like
this
aging
it
would
be
a
wise
move
to
mellow
it
out
mouthfeel
is
full
and
airy
silky
with
a
good
amount
of
carbonation
ive
had
better
quads
but
they
are
usually
from
belgium
this
three
philosophers
is
probably
the
best
quad
coming
from
the
usa
or
at
least
from
what
i
have
had
cheers
from
what
i
can
remember
it
smells
and
tastes
similar
to
the
hennepin
but
stronger
in
flavor
and
alcohol
i
smell
fruits
maybe
prunes
apples
some
malt
taste
is
the
same
with
a
finish
of
alcohol
and
some
hops
pretty
drinkable
another
good
brew
from
ommegang
d
even
at
9
8
this
is
a
strong
drinkable
ale
highly
drinkable
if
it
were
available
in
my
area
id
always
have
some
on
hand
2004
poured
a
hazy
brownish
red
color
with
a
thin
tan
head
that
left
nice
lacing
on
the
glass
aroma
of
tart
cherry
and
caramel
malts
spices
and
light
alcohol
taste
of
pepper
caramel
some
cocoa
cherries
and
some
yeast
as
well
reminds
me
of
a
candy
apple
between
the
thickness
and
the
strength
and
complexity
of
flavor
this
really
is
best
enjoyed
slowly
in
small
amounts
and
without
food
as
much
as
i
enjoyed
it
i
could
only
have
one
small
glass
in
an
evening
but
ill
happily
have
that
one
glass
any
opportunity
i
get
looks
like
a
nice
dark
red
wine
with
some
brown
tints
head
fades
fast
in
its
place
comes
some
consistent
and
evenly
placed
streams
of
carbonation
smells
sour
and
malty
with
cherry
and
caramel
aromas
a
delicious
clean
taste
up
front
very
sweet
and
winelike
cherries
grapes
bitter
greens
nice
alcohol
warmth
follows
the
carbonation
is
well
integrated
some
slightly
roasted
smoky
flavors
as
well
predominantly
in
the
aftertaste
slightly
dry
all
in
all
but
this
trait
is
presented
well
goes
straight
to
my
head
drink
slowly
mmm
this
tastes
a
bit
more
alcoholic
than
it
is
and
that
hampers
drinkabliity
a
little
bit
but
its
well
worth
it
otherwise
pours
a
very
deep
and
dark
plumish
amber
color
with
a
medium
sized
light
brown
head
that
doesnt
seem
to
leave
much
lacing
smells
of
sweet
malts
chocolate
and
cherries
a
very
pleasant
smell
that
begs
to
be
drank
a
waterfall
of
flavors
hits
the
palette
upon
first
taste
i
first
get
plenty
of
chocolate
flavor
some
malty
flavors
then
sugar
cane
followed
by
the
slightly
sour
cherry
lambic
flavor
to
finish
it
off
leaves
a
very
pleasant
aftertaste
quite
enjoyed
this
one
however
it
is
about
2
years
old
i
wonder
how
it
tasted
upon
fresh
brewing
ommegang
beers
first
past
the
post
overall
i
would
say
for
the
price
and
the
quality
of
three
philosophers
this
is
a
highly
drinkable
quad
definately
going
to
be
putting
it
into
my
regular
rotation
i
will
definitely
have
this
beer
again
my
girfriend
even
liked
it
now
to
the
food
this
might
not
work
so
well
with
most
entrees
but
there
are
few
better
dessert
beers
around
imo
with
a
dark
chocolate
cake
a
cherry
cheesecake
or
other
rich
dessert
this
beer
shines
but
to
my
surprise
it
goes
nicely
with
lighter
desserts
too
for
this
tasting
i
had
it
with
a
fresh
raspberry
and
blueberry
tart
with
bjs
vanilla
ice
cream
and
some
excellent
chocolate
cookies
absolutely
perfect
the
cherries
and
the
sourness
meld
with
the
berries
and
the
richness
matches
up
well
with
the
ice
cream
try
this
beer
with
dessert
and
you
wont
be
disappointed
it
was
very
good
for
the
length
of
the
bottle
but
i
wondered
if
it
would
be
better
in
colder
weather
md
kind
of
strong
but
easy
down
the
girls
thought
it
was
a
bit
strong
but
i
enjoyed
it
a
little
too
thick
but
very
tasty
i
prefer
the
cherries
in
ngwbr
but
much
better
the
sa
cherry
wheat
i
fixed
up
a
yeomans
feast
while
trüb
strained
to
open
the
vintage
three
philosophers
with
his
mustachio
heavily
persperating
into
the
glory
hole
of
nectar
afterall
one
should
never
bloody
his
apron
with
the
tumescence
of
ghoulish
beers
while
his
dickbutlereuphemism
for
personal
homeplebe
lurks
near
well
this
wasnt
as
ghastly
as
it
was
not
beer
it
was
undercarbonated
bampagne
a
gassy
little
beer
in
a
big
time
bottle
it
uncorked
it
bit
and
it
sang
like
bubbly
not
even
the
dancing
porkchops
could
make
it
beer
the
peppers
of
yellow
red
and
green
cajoled
it
to
be
but
it
could
not
i
even
asked
it
politely
to
salutate
with
a
hamfisted
beer
ello
but
it
said
no
sir
get
your
violin
and
bree
cheese
out
because
the
french
waiter
and
weird
sounding
police
cars
are
going
to
buzz
by
your
summertime
window
with
this
one
rap
tap
table
tap
delicious
and
balanced
the
taste
lives
up
to
the
nose
this
is
really
good
deep
amber
red
color
with
a
foamy
tan
head
nice
retention
on
the
head
first
sniff
is
full
or
dark
fruits
cherries
and
plums
followed
by
a
sweet
maltyness
the
smooth
mouthfeel
is
the
first
impression
when
you
taste
this
one
the
flavors
are
rich
and
powerful
but
somehow
hidden
by
the
smoothness
of
this
beer
nice
maltyness
and
mild
cherry
flavor
show
themselves
the
high
abv
is
amazingly
well
hidden
another
winner
from
ommegang
dgood
drink
for
a
cold
day
a
definite
sipping
brew
this
beer
has
great
flavor
but
dont
try
to
rush
this
i
was
on
the
fence
on
whether
to
give
taste
a
5
but
i
figured
i
dont
have
enough
quad
experience
to
do
so
the
beer
poured
a
deep
hazy
amber
color
with
a
thick
tan
head
that
disapated
rather
quickly
and
left
behind
a
solid
ring
around
the
edge
of
the
glass
and
some
floating
islands
in
the
middle
the
beer
has
a
very
distinct
aroma
of
cloves
yeast
cherries
and
maybe
some
other
dried
fruits
sweet
and
malty
and
hard
to
put
down
the
taste
is
a
bit
tart
but
balances
out
well
with
the
cherry
taste
malty
sweetness
and
then
rounds
out
with
an
alcohol
kick
on
the
back
end
which
is
pleasing
to
the
palate
based
on
the
high
abv
this
is
a
bigger
beer
to
drink
but
being
very
smooth
is
is
fairly
easy
to
drink
as
well
good
drinkability
for
the
style
its
not
often
i
drink
a
whole
bottle
of
this
drinkability
a
great
offering
from
the
folks
at
ommegang
had
the
opportunity
to
drink
this
ontap
a
few
times
at
zenos
in
state
college
pa
and
enjoyed
just
as
much
now
as
i
did
then
drinkable
wellbalanced
example
of
the
style
not
as
much
of
the
fruit
burst
on
the
front
palate
as
i
expected
but
the
cherries
on
the
middle
palate
provide
an
interesting
and
welcome
twist
ill
definitely
be
buying
this
again
in
the
nottoodistant
future
this
was
really
good
and
would
be
worth
keeping
a
few
bombers
around
thats
what
ill
be
looking
for
next
time
hard
to
pin
down
but
easy
to
love
definitely
on
the
sweet
side
but
you
almost
dont
realize
it
because
the
flavors
have
so
much
depth
there
are
many
sides
to
this
one
utterly
enjoyable
a
fantastic
piece
of
work
easily
one
of
the
best
nonbelgian
belgians
that
ive
had
this
tends
to
be
said
a
lot
about
ommegang
and
with
good
reason
d
very
drinkable
the
high
alcohol
content
may
make
it
a
bit
less
drinkable
when
sitting
down
for
a
session
or
atleast
i
would
hope
so
very
very
tasty
and
i
plan
to
buy
another
and
enjoy
it
thoroughly
750ml
bottle
pours
out
a
rich
brown
color
with
a
hint
of
red
when
held
to
the
light
nice
creamy
head
that
falls
fairly
quickly
and
leaves
nice
lacing
the
smell
is
malty
sweet
with
dark
fruits
some
of
the
alcohol
can
be
noticed
in
the
nose
also
very
complex
taste
slightly
medicinal
very
malty
dark
cherry
flavors
too
the
alcohol
is
slightly
noticeable
in
the
finish
hops
a
just
barely
in
the
mix
but
balance
everything
out
nicely
the
mouthfeel
is
smooth
rich
and
creamy
but
does
not
have
any
stickiness
to
it
i
love
this
beer
this
is
a
great
after
dinner
sipper
a
very
drinkable
beer
complex
rich
not
to
be
missed
this
beer
is
similiar
to
regular
ommegang
but
there
is
definitely
a
stronger
cherry
taste
very
nice
and
highly
reccomended
easily
drinkable
and
enjoyable
ommegang
only
seems
to
make
winners
drinks
pretty
good
i
think
this
is
one
to
lay
down
for
years
worth
it
9

a
bottle
otherwise
there
are
plenty
of
other
beers
to
explore
if
youre
not
into
something
as
meaty
as
a
quarupel
this
isnt
a
proper
introduction
very
drinkable
this
beer
is
very
rich
and
full
of
flavor
i
think
that
this
beer
would
both
be
an
excellent
pairing
with
rich
foods
as
well
as
a
great
beer
to
cook
with
a
modern
classic
of
blending
a
the
least
head
ive
ever
seen
on
any
belgianstyle
beer
but
a
beautiful
dark
mahogany
colored
brew
smells
tight
and
pointedly
fruitykind
of
a
flat
and
musty
fruit
its
actual
taste
is
not
as
fruity
as
i
expected
especially
since
i
still
cringe
at
the
thought
of
sicklysweet
lambic
style
and
i
figured
it
would
be
a
moderated
version
of
that
really
its
more
of
a
sour
compromised
version
of
a
fairly
good
belgian
ale
its
pretty
good
and
definitely
worth
trying
and
enjoying
but
it
wouldnt
be
a
priority
for
my
personal
future
purchasing
schedule
its
very
different
and
interesting
and
the
9
8
in
this
bomber
is
going
to
knock
me
out
for
the
night
judged
for
style
against
other
belgiansquadrupels
just
a
completely
enjoyable
complex
brew
three

pours
a
dark
brown
with
an
off
white
head
from
a
brown
twelve
ounce
bottle
i
can
smell
some
cherry
in
the
aroma
the
taste
has
a
little
bit
of
cherry
in
it
malt
is
also
noticeable
there
are
some
medicinal
type
flavors
as
well
this
is
an
interesting

its
definitely
pretty
good
but
not
particularly
to
my
liking

pours
a
deep
brown
bordering
black
with
ruby
tinges
around
the
edge
of
the
glass
the
head
is
a
tad
on
the
small
side
but
other
than
that
this
is
a
good
looking
beer
smell
is
like
a
quad
but
a
bit
more
sour
ripe
fruits
with
a
tart
bite
taste
is
much
like
the
smell
the
beer
starts
out
with
a
fruity
sweetness
but
toward
the
end
of
the
drink
transitions
smoothly
into
a
sour
note
in
a
good
way
mouthfeel
is
good
full
bodied
but
a
little
alcoholic
drinkablity
is
pretty
good
too
nice
beer
drinkability
you
might
have
to
call
the
paramedics
if
i
got
my
hands
on
a
case
an
interesting
pour
characteristic
of
ommegang
cloudy
apple
cider
amber
color
with
some
copper
red
present
too
a
relatively
small
amount
of
tan

that
nonetheless
sticks
around
for
a
while
and
clings
pretty
well
nose
improved
noticeably
as
this
one
warmed
with
sweet
but
complex
malts
reminding
me
of
scotch
ales
tinged
with
sour
cherry
spices
and
a
bit
of
alcohol
the
taste
too
improved
as
the
beer
and
i
warmed
that
maltycherryspicy
blend
faded
nicely
into
a
slightly
warm
and
nicely
lingering
finish
the
mouthfeel
is
intriguingly
soft
and
full
with
a
lasting
crispness
while
i
will
stick
with
some
of
ommegangs
other
offerings
this
one
is
worth
another
go
i
look
forward
to
pairing
it
with
some
appropriate
chow
overall
an
interesting
take
on
the
quadrupelthey
claim
to
mix
with
a
cherry
lambic
and
it
shows
yielding
a
bittersweet
nearly
syrupy
concoction
much
better
sipped
than
gulped

my
first
bottle
since
my
review
a
12ozer
as
deliciously
cherry
tarty
and
with
the
same
caramel
sweetness
as
the
750ml
bottles
it
lost
nothing
going
down
from
the
large
format
bottle
at
all
a
real
treat
to
drink
pours
an
amber
cloudy
brown
with
good
head
and
minimal
lacing
smells
of
dried
fruits
dates
caramel
and
fig
notes
as
well
a
strong
hop
presence
tastes
like
much
of
the
same
mouthfeel
is
somewhat
bitter
but
smooth
overall
drinkability
is
limited
by
high
ac
but
this
is
sweet
enough
to
power
over
the
stong
alcohol
taste
poured
from
a
corked
and
caged
750
ml
bottle
this
beer
had
a
brownish
amber
appearance
with
a
huge

lingered
in

taste
was
a
wonderful
mix
of
sweet
malts
dark
fruit
cherries
chocolate
and
alcohol
i
could
taste
a
little
bit
of
sour
wineyness
in
the
finish
this
is
a
very
rich
and
warming
brew
that
is
very
easy
to
drink
despite
the
heavy
body
i
polished
off
the
entire
bottle
in
about
an
hour
and
enjoyed
every
drop
of
it
an
excellent
beer
for
the
money5

this
should
be
enjoyed
sparsly
with
friends
and
would
be
fantastic
at
the
end
of
a
good
meal
an
absolute
pleasure
to
enjoy
on
its
own
swirl
it
around
in
your
glass
a
bit
it
will
bring
out
some
really
amazing
scents
overall
though
just
a
great
brew
and
the
fact
i
can
pick
up
a
750
and
local
quicky
mart
for
6
just
makes
it
even
better
this
might
be
a
little
too
big
flavorwise
to
drink
too
much
of
but
a
really
great
interpretation
of
the
style
drinkablity
this
goes
down
very
easy
and
is
delicious

limits
it
to

was
going

on

but
i
just
cant
it

the
full

just
excersize
due
diligence
and
repsonsilblity
youll
be
wasted
in
no
time
flat
after
two
750s
without
seeing
it
coming
because
this
excellent
ale
completely
hides
and
i
mean
completely
hides
the
potency
of
its
high
abv
note
sometime
early
in

the

i
poured
the

never

got
this
on

at

in
carlisle
pa
when
i
dropped
my
kid
off
at
college
whoda
thunk
i
was
pretty
amazed
at
the
flavor
dried
fruit
like
raisins
and
prune
good
malt
and
very
yeasty
but
very
little
hops
very
high
alcohol
percentage
but
it
doesnt
show
up
so
much
in
the
flavor
more
a
warmth
as
it
goes
down
your
throat
it
pours
a
light
brown
lighter
than
the
gulden
draak
dark
triple
carbonation
is
good
not
too
much
small
bubbles
like
a
good
champagne
and
it
has
a
very
rich
mouth
feel
i
like
it
better
than
the
dark
triple
possibly
the
best
beer
ive
ever
tasted
i
wonder
if
it
would
be
as
good
in
bottles
and
i
wish
i
could
find
it
in
stores
the
dark
triple
is
now
available
in
wegmans
but
not
not
the

in

than

a
decent
quad
but
different
than
other
ones
i
have
had
ok
but
im
not
sure
i
will
revisit
this
one
rangerredoct
16
mango
with
great
malts
and
sweet
characters
but
i
have
been
drinking
the
golden
dragon
for
years
now
appears
a
deep
amber
bronze
hue
with
billowing
off
white
head
forms
thick
fine
even
bubbled
carbonation
but
to
be
honest
and
esp
lately
since
im
now
pushing
50
i
seem
to
have
developed
a
low
tolerance
for
sweet
and
have
moved
away
from
quads
altogether
im
definitely
more
of
a
triple
fan
these
days
but
just
had
a
a
gulden
draak
9000
and
it
is
perfect
superb
dry
with
the
essence
of
sweet
plums
and
brown
sugar
phenomenal
started
out
with
2
bottles
just
finished
one
in
that
it
presents
very
much
like
a
trippel
in
color
nose
and
flavor
profile
an
outstanding
beer
overall
after
cleaning
up
the
beer
that
spilled
on
opening
even
though
you
handled
the
bottle
like
live
nitroglycerin
and
waiting
a
full
5
minutes
for
the
head
to
shrink
to
something
less
than
56
of
your
glass
youll
have
an
amazing
time
well
worth
waiting
for
and
well
worth
buying
lots
of
it
a
very
well
done
lighter
quad
that
can
be
drunk
in
a
wide
variety
of
occasions
poured
from
a
bottle
into
a
snifter
the
beer
is
a
bright
vibrant
ambergold
coloring
with
a
tall
frothy
big
bubbled
white
head
that
starts
tall
and
slowly
settles
into
a
surface
coating
nose
of
apricot
pineapple
toffee
caramel
roast
clove
nutmeg
and
cinnamon
the
different
aroma
characteristics
come
together
masterfully
remaining
balanced
and
avoiding
overpowering
the
senses
flavors
are
bold
and
smooth
with
a
solid
caramel
backbone
supporting
a
warming
booze
character
spice
blend
of
cinnamon
nutmeg
and
all
spice
and
a
fleeting
highlight
of
bubblegum
old
world
fruit
and
some
earthy
notes
very
bold
very
robust
and
a
touch
of
heavy
the
body
is
robust
but
kept
slightly
light
and
effervescent
through
the
carbonation
rich
sweetness
and
booze
warmth
in
the
aftertaste
with
an
old
world
fruit
linger
and
building
warmth
in
the
finish
great
beer
o
reminds
me
a
bit
of
sherry
if
carbonated
a
bit
too
alcoholic
but
it
has
some
nice
complexity
it
the
taste
o
a
really
good
quad
overall
a
tad
lighter
in
each
category
than
what
i
prefer
for
the
style
on
its
own
however
a
really
great
beer
o
great
beer
very
complex
with
a
great
mingling
of
flavors
not
my
favorite
quad
but
one
i
will
never
say
no
to
the
mouthfeel
isnt
quite
as
great
as
some
of
the
other
quads
ive
had
92
o
i
see
why
this
is
so
highly
rated
great
by
itself
as
a
sipper
very
cool
style
lives
up
to
its
rating
found
it
at
my
now
favourite
dealer
in
town
o
wonderful
beer
the
easiest
drinking
quad
ive
ever
had
yum
overall
take
your
time
when
drinking
this
gem
it
is
incredibly
well
crafted
i
appreciate
quality
and
this
beer
easily
carries
it
beginning
to
end
salud
overall
this
is
a
great
beer
much
sweeter
than
the
trappistes
rochefort
10
this
is
still
a
great
beer
although
i
dont
think
it
compares
to
it
overall
this
quad
honestly
gives
a
monk
a
run
for
their
money
easily
my
favorite
nontrappist
quad
thats
including
abt
12
this
is
honestly
a
very
underrated
beer
ive
had
their
tripel
and
it
was
amazing
and
this
is
just
an
all
around
amazing
brew
i
will
be
buying
this
again
in
my
opinion
this
one
almost
rivals
the
beloved
rochefort
10
and
is
cheaper
is
by
about
3
00
where
i
live
pleasantly
surprised
once
again
from
this
sleeper
belgian
brewery
will
be
trying
all
of
their
beers
o
not
mind
blowing
but
certain
solid
belgian
quads
o
gulden
draak
is
incredible
but
gulden
draak
9000
is
even
more
so
great
for
a
barbeque
or
casual
dinner
event
try
with
steak
or
very
flavorful
game
d
great
quad
good

complexity

mouthfeel
sorry
but
i
havent
actually
paired
this
beer
to
anything
however
it
would
more
than
likely
be
good
with
some
smoked
pork
cotswold
cheese
and
black
grapes
not
a
bad
quad
by
any
means
but
different
if
you
are
looking
for
something
like
st
bernardus
or
westy
this
isnt
it
its
a
bit
lighter
more
like
a
german
quad
if
thats
possible
id
drink
again
for
sure
cheers
to
be
fair
this
ones
a
doozy
once
the
bottom
of
the
bottle
is
hit
and
the
alcohol
fully
kicks
in
this
never
fully
tasted
like
booze
but
this
was
one
of
the
most
aggressive
belgian
beers
that
ive
ever
or
would
expect
to
have
its
to
be
expected
for
a
quadrupel
and
while
this
wasnt
as
good
or
as
dark
as
the
trappist
quads
that
ive
had
this
held
its
own
and
was
certainly
worth
a
go
once
i
view
it
more
as
a
strong
tripel
than
a
quad
if
only
because
the
hue
and
styles
of
fruit
were
different
but
aside
from
my
take
on
this
this
was
a
quad
in
every
sense
of
the
word
and
worth
a
go
for
anyone
patient
enough
to
enjoy
all
this
had
to
offer
o
great
brew
while
a
genuinely
tasty
offering
the
overall
intricacies
dont
really
keep
up
with
the
best
in
class
sure
the
booze
is
expertly
integrated
and
while
theres
lots
going
on
in
its
own
right
theres
just
a
certain
je
ne
sais
quoi
lightness
of
being
that
renders
me
just
a
wee
bit
down
about
this
style
that
i
share
manys
affinity
for
while
not
quite
to
style
this
was
enjoyed
while
reading
and
listening
to
live
harp
music
the
moment
was
sublime
on
a
gentle
quiet
afternoon
while
the
stark
exterior
whiteness
contrasted
against
the
dark
green
norwegian
pines
overall
this
definitely
one
i
will
be
revisiting
especially
since
the
brewpub
is
only
about
a
block
away
from
me
i
like
the
regular
version
better
i
think
this
one
is
punishingly
boozy
with
no
apologies
i
mean
i
know
its
a
quad
and
it
should
be
big
but
this
is
hard
to
drink
pours
super
light
for
its
genre
orange
hued
bronze
color
maybe
even
lighter
fairly
clear
with
a
sudsy
white
head
the
nose
is
all
alcohol
a
touch
of
banana
and
other
fruits
towards
the
end
and
some
candy
sugar
but
the
alcohol
is
by
far
the
most
forward
aroma
same
is
true
with
the
taste
it
finishes
hot
but
some
banana
from
the
yeast
is
left
over
after
the
alcohol
burns
off
hints
of
honey
vanilla
and
black
papper
flash
in
and
out
but
in
the
end
its
booze
and
sugar
too
much
for
me
and
i
am
a
lover
of
quads
but
this
one
has
glaring
imbalances
even
for
its
strength
its
still
a
very
well
made
beer
of
course
but
in
comparison
to
the
regular
gulden
draak
this
is
inferior
in
my
opinion
750mls
of
this
could
kill
a
small
child
o
after
the
cork
incident
i
was
prepared
for
the
worst
but
got
a
pleasant
surprise
this
is
a
wonderful
belgian
pale
strong
ale
its
a
barley
wine
unashamed
to
have
all
the
great
belgian
characteristics
overall
rather
sweet
and
high
abvone
glass
is
enough
cant
say
id
seek
this
out
again
when
there
are
more
complex
and
tasty
belgian
quads
to
drink
overall
4
25
expensive
yes
worth
it
yes
i
am
a
big
fan
of
the
van
steenberge
brewery
and
this
version
of
draak
is
worth
the
price
imho
different
in
several
important
ways
from
its
more
easily
found
cousin
this
beer
is
nonetheless
excellent
and
well
worth
tracking
down
excellent
and
further
proof
of
the
embarrassment
of
riches
present
at
van
steenberge
brewery
more
a
bspa
than
quad
this
is
a
golden
copper
with
a
dense
offwhite
head
with
excellent
retention
and
moderate
lacing
the
nose
is
a
blend
of
yeast
spice
clove
fennel
golden
raisins
ripe
white
grapes
honey
and
caramel
too
sweet
for
my
liking
this
beer
opens
with
a
blend
of
honey
caramel
toffee
and
spice
theres
bubblegum
not
my
favorite
flavor
as
well
spicy
and
sweet
with
some
yeast
on
the
finish
this
beer
is
mediumfull
in
body
and
highly
carbonated
decent
i
much
prefer
the
regular
version
of
this
beer
pretty
damn
good
flavorful
tasty
quad
good
balance
contains
its
strength
better
than
you
would
expect
all
around
fantastic
overall
a
very
good
quad
id
like
to
know
specifically
whats
different
between
this
and
the
standard
gulden
draak
but
both
are
enjoyable
o
not
what
i
expected
in
a
quad
used
to
bernardus
as
the
measuring
bar
falls
well
short
price
point
6
4911
2oz
bottle
very
tasty
quad
although
i
think
i
may
prefer
the
regular
gulden
draak
to
this
one
certainly
not
bad
for
the
price
seeing
as
how
its
cheaper
than
many
quads
of
similar
size
gulden
draak
9000
is
a
bit
dark
and
the
booze
is
a
bit
overpowering
however
its
delicious
with
a
lot
of
layers
and
complexity
in
the
flavor
its
not
a
great
quad
but
its
a
pleasure
to
drink
light
carbonation
works
for
it
not
so
overwhelming
that
it
needs
any
more
ive
had
better
in
the
style
i
e
st
bernardus
but
this
sure
aint
bad
for
not
being
a
trappist
a
solid
quad
but
not
as
deep
and
rich
worth
a
try
cheers
o
except
for
the
crazy
foam
when
i
opened
it
this
was
a
wonderful
brew
recommended
good
looking
beer
good
sincere
smell
balanced
in
terms
of
grain
and
hops
a
light
sweet
flavor
slightly
fruity
yeast
is
hidden
in
flavor
profile
amber
in
color
and
very
clear
with
slight
coagulation
from
refrigeration
residual
effects
of
abv
from
a
quadrupel
wasnt
evidenced
after
one
but
drinking
several
those
effects
might
accrue
4packs
were
selling
for
23
95
so
this
is
expensive
too
a
single
12
oz
bottle
was
purchased
for
6
59
mouth
feel
is
medium
the
tingle
and
fluidity
are
light
overall
a
good
beer
but
it
has
really
been
mismarketed
although
there
are
some
quad
elements
in
the
flavour
it
is
much
closer
to
a
tripel
or
bspa
i
have
reviewed
purely
on
the
merits
of
the
beer
rather
than
to
style
you
would
certainly
never
include
this
beer
in
a
quad
tasting
or
anything
of
the
like
pretty
unusual
drinkability
a
good
beer
in
the
style
belgian
strong
dark
ale
pours
a
lovely
amber
with
some
pink
and
orangish
hues
im
getting
almost
no
nose
from
this
at
all
besides
the
typical
yeast
you
get
from
a
quad
or
a
tripel
im
actually
very
disappointed
in
this
once
you
take
a
sip
the
disappointment
from
the
nose
goes
away
pretty
quickly
biscuit
apricot
leafy
things
with
a
bit
of
citrus
all
meshing
together
seamlessly
mouthfeel
has
a
lot
of
carbonation
early
and
finishes
semi
dry
for
a
very
different
mouthfeel
that
covers
all
areas
overall
a
very
good
beer
but
not
being
able
to
smell
it
brings
it
down
a
tad
overall
okay
but
not
as
good
as
the
regular
gulden
draak
o
gulden
drake
9000
seems
to
straddle
the
quad
and
the
triple
styles
and
it
does
so
with
skilled
precision
with
hints
of
alcohol
but
notes
of
sweet
malts
it
does
marry
the
2
styles
but
overall
this
brew
is
terrific
if
it
were
presented
as
a
triple
i
think
it
might
get
better
marks
however
if
you
think
of
it
as
a
variation
on
the
style
it
still
blends
the
2
styles
artfully
definitely
worth
a
try
keep
an
open
mind
very
interesting
beer
it
calls
itself
a
quadrupel
but
is
the
lightest
in
color
and
flavor
of
any
quad
ive
ever
tasted
it
juicy
and
mildly
sweet
ultimately
the
beer
falls
short
with
its
poor
mouthfeel
and
flavor
that
is
a
little
too
subtle
for
the
style
overall
funny
the
call
the
regular
gulden
draak
a
dark
tripel
and
it
taste
just
like
a
good
bsda
the
call
the
9000
version
a
quad
and
its
much
more
like
a
strong
tripel
in
flavor
either
way
its
a
delicious
beer
o
about
five
years
of
age
would
probably
do
this
one
some
good
its
good
but
just
a
bit
too
sweet
and
boozy
for
me
to
love
if
you
can
wait
a
long
while
to
crack
this
one
open
o
this
is
a
fantastic
quadrupel
glad
i
was
able
to
find
one
in
kansas
poured
from
a
33cl
bottle
into
a
goblet
didnt
see
a
bottled
date
this
pours
a
mid
sized
off
white
head
which
has
medium
retention
and
leaves
a
lacing
and
the
color
is
slightly
golden
color
the
smells
are
spicy
some
belgian
funk
some
coriander
some
fruit
esters
the
feel
is
medium
high
carbonination
the
taste
is
spicy
a
little
hop
bitterness
not
as
much
malts
as
expected
very
dry
but
tasty
overall
this
is
excellent
beer
and
one
of
the
better
quads
on
the
market
i
did
find
that
the
taste
didnt
quite
live
up
to
the
promise
of
the
aromas
but
even
at
that
the
flavors
were
delicious
and
almost
perfectly
balanced
a
musttry
for
fans
of
belgian
ales
taste
comes
across
like
a
freight
train
its
strong
and
assertive
on
the
palate
with
a
wallop
of
fruit
spice
and
bread
right
up
front
the
finish
leaves
a
warming
boozy
kick
truly
a
big
heavy
and
complex
ale
that
rivals
the
original
gulden
draak
classic
and
beautiful
source
purchased
at
specs
in
austin
tx
at
11
99
o
easy
to
drink
and
lots
of
lighter
flavors
this
is
an
oddtake
on
a
quadruple
this
is
brighter
in
color
and
hoppiersweeterlighter
flavor
than
other
typical
examples
of
the
style
although
i
will
purchase
again
o
this
is
a
very
tasty
beer
and
i
am
glad
that
i
have
been
able
to
try
it
the
quad
thing
really
bothers
me
because
it
just
doesnt
taste
like
one
but
if
you
can
overlook
that
part
its
quite
delicious
quite
good
as
i
expected
it
to
be
drink
i
thought
it
was
really
tasty
didnt
exactly
fit
the
style
but
oh
well
sometimes
line
blur
between
things
tasty
beer
might
grab
a
bottle
or
two
d
one
is
enough
i
like
the
other
draak
better
i
think
bottle
poured
a
deep
clear

with
a
large
foamy
head
with

some
light

with
some

sugar
and
some

quite
intense

is
also
a
complex
mix
between
light

with
some
dry
fruits
and
some
residual
sugar
with
light
warming
notes
of
alcohol
body
is
quite
full
with
good
carbonation
and
some
alcohol
was
apparent
nice
level
of
complexity
but
still
a
tad
too
sweet
for
my
taste
buds
which
could
have
been
levelled
out
with
a
23
reduction
in
abv
a
good
beer
quite
balanced
and
such
but
i
prefer
a
dark
quad
over
this
overall
hmm
im
kind
of
conflicted
about
this
beer
its
appearance
is
out
of
this
world
the
taste
is
very
nice
refined
smooth
with
good
mouthfeel
but
its
just
not
doing
it
for
me
i
cant
really
put
my
finger
on
it
everything
works
for
what
it
is
but
its
nothing
new
and
lacking
soem
complexity
i
look
for
in
my
quads
very
good
beer
thats
very
refined
with
a
dynamite
appearance
but
there
are
better
quads
out
there
quite
enjoyable
but
the
appearance
is
not
what
i
was
expecting
interesting
and
different
a
fine
strong
beer
and
one
i
shall
endevour
to
have
again

its

for

overall
a
very

beer
not
quite
up
to
my
favorite
quad
but
well
worth
having
i
would
gladly
drink
more
of
this
tastes
as
a
it
smells
straightforward
for
the
style
but
still
wonderfully
strong

similar
dark

this
beer
poured
out
as
an
orange
color
not
really
what
i
was
expecting
for
a
quad
the
head
was
big
fluffy
and
cream
colored
the
head
settles
and
leaves
a
film
on
top
of
the
beer
the
smell
of
the
beer
was
loaded
with
caramel
dark
fruits
and
belgian
yeast
the
taste
of
the
beer
was
a
little
stronger
than
it
should
have
been
there
was
a
light
amount
hop
bitterness
in
there
that
i
feel
overpowered
the
beers
sweetness
the
mouthfeel
was
sharp
and
not
as
soft
and
creamy
as
it
should
taste
overall
this
isnt
the
best
best
quad
out
there
it
was
nice
to
try
but
i
wouldnt
reccomend
this
to
someone
who
is
curious
about
the
style
o
good
quad
here
unique
in
the
fact
that
it
is
more
like
a
tripel
the
alcohol
is
somewhat
tame
given
the
abv
refreshing
and
drinkable
a
very
nice
mellow
quadruple
no
big
gestures
rather
light
i
like
this
its
very
good
and
has
a
lot
of
great
belgian
characteristics
but
is
quite
a
bit
removed
from
what
most
people
consider
a
belgian
quad
it
seems
more
like
a
super
charged
tripel
but
its
good
enough
that
it
doesnt
matter
overall
another
world
class
beer
from
brouwerij
van
steenberge
n
v
just
as
good
as
regular
gulden
draak
i
may
buy
a
bottle
or
two
to
forget
about
for
a
year
or
so
but
i
doubt
it
will
do
any
good
it
is
just
too
estery
and
the
residual
sugars
just
hammer
it
a
rich
brew
a
little
sweet
but
very
good
overall
this
is
really
good
very
flavorful
and
strong
yet
the
alcohol
is
masked
well
tons
of
sweet
fruits
yeasts
and
spices
its
very
pricey
but
this
should
be
treated
as
a
speciality
not
a
everyday
or
week
or
even
month
beer
shell
out
the
cash
if
you
enjoy
quads
regular
gulden
draak
or
belgium
ales
in
general
very
nice
beer
o
im
not
as
impressed
with
this
reimagining
of
gulden
draak
as
some
other
reviewers
i
enjoy
the
more
pronounced
hop
character
and
the
flavors
imparted
by
the
lighter
malts
but
the
alcohol
presence
is
way
too
heavy
and
forceful
even
for
the
style
couple
this
with
the
fact
that
the
head
retention
is
severely
lacking
and
you
have
a
strong
ale
that
may
need
to
be
tweaked
a
bit
in
the
future
i
may
revisit
this
one
a
year
or
two
down
the
road
to
see
if
anything
has
changed
but
for
now
its
solid
but
not
exceptional
jd
although
the
alcohol
is
roughly
the
same
as
the
original
draak
its
barely
lighter
malting
allows
for
superb
balance
of
fruit
and
spice
to
play
a
larger
role
although
it
also
exposes
its
higher
and
somewhat
distracting
hop
bitterness
and
needleprick
alcohols
overall
a
lot
different
than
any
quad
ive
had
the
tartness
balances
out
the
typically
cloying
malt
bill
well
but
theres
enough
complexity
to
keep
me
coming
back
for
more
taste
is
ooh
yeah
overall
sweet
and
sugary
like
i
would
expect
from
a
quad
d
complex
and
relatively
balanced
the
tart
malt
works
well
with
the
yeast
im
left
wondering
if
this
is
labeled
a
quad
simply
by
nature
of
being
the
strongest
in
the
lineup
as
such
i
didnt
rate
to
the
style
guidelines
beyond
the
general
characteristics
of
strong
and
tasty
belgian
beers
rated
on
its
own
merit
is
is
definitely
enjoyable
although
not
exceptional

reminds
me
more
of

than
a

maybe
they
just
like
to
have
fun
with
their
beer
classifications
either
way
both
brews
are
phenomenal
in
their
own
right
if
i
was
a
wealthier
man
i
would
have
a
steady
supply
of
each
in
my
fridge
i
can
see
myself
picking
this
up
more
often
if
it
ends
up
being
a
new
regular
gd
brew
o
very
good
flavor
a
little
sweet
easy
to
drink
for
the
alochol
content
but
probably
cant
drink
more
than
one
glass
because
of
the
sweetness
prefer
the
regular
gulden
draak
however
this
is
still
good
a
golden
quadrupel
perhaps
more
of
a
bastard
child
of
a
bspa
and
quad
has
a
lot
of
bspa
characteristics
but
does
some
fruitiness
and
earthiness
you
can
find
in
quads
its
good
i
was
overtaken
by
the
color
of
the
beer
as
i
poured
it
i
was
expecting
a
darker
tone
the
rich
amber
color
was
very
nice
this
beer
for
me
is
highly
yeast
driven
as
i
picked
up
the
aroma
of
spices
and
somewhat
of
dried
banana
and
corriander
very
nice
a
great
pallet
cleanser
and
very
enjoyable
brew
a
lighter
srm
to
its
original
version

you
can
find

and
i
have
to
say
its
over

im
a
little
taken
aback
this

on

alcohol
is
quite
strong

after

is
opened
carbonation
is
just
right
start
to
finish
the
was
a
great
beer
o
truly
delicious
with
only
a
few
reviews
i
guess
this
is
a
new
release
or
a
rarity
the
abv
is
rocksolid
and
man
this
is
why
belgium
gets
such
respect
for
their
beers
those
guys
know
beer
shoulda
bought
the
whole
4pack
o
good
beer
im
not
very
impressed
ill
try
it
again
in
the
future
for
now
it
was
a
lovely
experience
in
the
category
sweet
heavy
beers
a
topper
tasty
tingling
and
a
long
aftertaste
overall
i
poured
this
into
a
cantillon
tulip
i
was
surprised
to
read
that
this
is
a
quadruple
because
its
much
lighter
that
what
i
would
suspect
although
its
high
on
abv
10
5
abv
so
perfect
for
splitting
its
very
good
and
drinkable
i
would
buy
and
drink
again
and
again
and
again
lekker
note
in
belgium
the
bottle
is
titled
gulden
draak
9000
quadruple
in
dutchflemish
it
means
golden
dragon
this
is
a
very
nice
beer
but
not
as
bold
a
flavor
as
id
expect
from
a
quad
aftertaste
little
metallic
more
ripe
bananas
dried
apricots
will
probably
improve
a
lot
upon
aging
i
guess
its
still
a
little
too
young
pours
a
dark
brownishorange
w
a
beautiful
one
finger
cocoa
head
excellent
lacing
on
the
side
of
the
glass
im
super
excited
about
this
one
as
i
love
the
regular
gulden
draak
the
nose
is
belgian
yeast
fruits
raisins
dates
and
spices
not
quite
as
complex
as
the
standard
draak
taste
is
the
same
its
just
not
quite
as
amazing
and
complex
as
the
regular
gulden
draak
its
still
really
good
just
not
amazing
feel
steps
it
up
a
notch
very
little
of
the
11
3
abv
is
evident
they
hid
it
somewhere
overall
this
is
a
really
good
beer
that
falls
short
of
great
cheers
overall
good
by
not
overly
memorable
worth
a
try
though
maybe
not
at
11
a
pour
o
the
man
at
the
booth
was
correct
and
we
all
agreed
this
stuff
is
dangerous
such
a
high
abv
packs
great
flavors
and
appearances
but
the
lightest
of
mouthfeels
this
is
a
scarey
kind
of
dangerous
by
the
time
you
feel
the
abv
youve
slammed
back
a
couple
and
its
too
late
will
be
buying
many
bottles
of
this
ok
but
not
awesome
others
are
better
while
it
offered
the
complex
flavors
of
a
quad
with
plum
and
toffee
the
lack
of
carbonation
and
burdensome
mouth
feel
made
it
unpalatable
i
would
have
rated
it
more
harshly
but
as
noted
it
lacked
sufficient
carbonation
and
i
fear
i
may
have
gotten
a
bad
bottle
figs
deeply
caramelized
malt
raisins
and
vinous
notes
form
the
aroma
toasted
caramel
sweet
nutty
malt
buttery
toffee
serve
as
the
backbone
with
raisins
lightly
tart
cherries
and
booze
rounding
out
the
flavor
profile
surprised
by
the
toffee
buttery
character
overall
a
very
well
made
and
balance
quad
never
had
a
beer
from
this
brewery
before
but
would
definitely
try
anything
else
they
make
after
giving
this
one
a
shot
o
a
very
solid
quad
glad
i
grabbed
another
bottle
to
take
home
o
nice
overall
but
i
think
it
would
be
better
if
there
were
a
bit
more
spice
and
a
bit
less
sweetness
overall
pretty
solid
quad
from
these
missouri
guys
all
their
beers
have
been
stellar
so
far
but
increasingly
harder
to
find
here
in
massachusetts
i
need
to
stock
up
o
after
shaking
out
some
of
the
carb
this
beer
is
very
solid
not
the
greatest
but
far
from
the
worst
the
finish
is
fantastic
but
i
fear
that
after
drinking
more
of
it
that
it
might
become
cloyingly
sweet
a
very
impressive
beer
with
good
flavors
and
solid
complexity
this
reminds
me
of
a
beer
i
had
a
couple
of
years
ago
at
the
milwaukee
ale
house
called
devils
advocate
they
had
on
cask
that
i
really
enjoyed
i
like
this
a
lot
and
by
the
way
happy
new
year
consumed
from
a
small
snifter
this
beer
poured
out
as
a
brownish
orange
color
it
has
a
white
head
on
top
seems
to
have
a
good
looking
retention
the
lacing
is
very
minimal
the
aroma
is
loaded
with
raisin
aromas
sweet
malts
and
bready
yeast
the
taste
of
this
beer
is
sweet
with
some
bitterness
in
there
there
is
a
touch
of
funk
in
there
too
the
mouthfeel
is
decent
its
heavy
with
a
moderate
carbonation
overall
the
taste
is
not
as
good
as
i
had
hoped
not
the
best
tasting
quad
out
there
it
was
ok
but
wouldnt
b
something
i
would
need
to
drink
again
o
one
damn
fine
beer
quads
are
rignt
in
my
wheelhouse
and
this
one
stands
up
to
the
best
that
i
have
tried
its
flavors
are
bold
but
balanced
and
at
12
its
a
sipper
that
can
be
savored
keeps
you
wanting
another
sip
get
some
for
the
winter
the
alcoholic
finish
is
dominant
and
dwarfs
the
finish
otherwise
the
beer
is
quite
excellent
o
although
this
beer
masks
its
alcohol
well
considering
its
strength
it
lacks
the
complexity
of
dark
fruit
flavors
and
sweetness
compared
to
other
beers
in
the
style
it
can
also
seem
a
little
cloying
at
times
and
isnt
one
of
the
easiest
beers
to
drink
o
great
depth
of
flavor
but
there
is
an
awful
lot
going
on
finishing
the
bottle
will
be
a
bit
of
a
challenge
just
because
of
the
overwhelming
sweetness
and
barrage
of
flavors
originally
reviewed

pours
a
brownish
body
w
minimal
head
that
died
quick
on
top
of
a
thick
malty
aroma
comprised
mostly
of
yeast
candi
sugarcaramel
sweet
malts
touch
of
chocolate
roasted
malts
as
well
as
a
touch
of
citirc
hops
a
rich
thick
malty
base
of
breadiness
gives
off
a
full
body
of
balance
getting
sweetness
from
caramel
and
something
like
chocolate
but
not
as
intense
as
well
as
a
dry
edge
from
some
roasted
malts
idk
why
im
picking
them
up
in
this
beer
a
little
bit
of
hop
and
peppery
zip
as
well
as
a
tinge
of
sharpness
in
the
finish
catching
me
offguard
due
to
very
high
abv
which
only
slightly
bleeds
into
beer
a
good
quad
to
sip
on
literally
and
perhaps
my
only
knock
is
that
is
a
little
simplistic
and
the
malts
are
the
dominant
force
somewhat
squashing
the
fruits
overtaking
blance
and
turning
a
potentially
great
quad
into
just
really
good
o
good
quad
this
is
the
2nd
of
the
750ml
bottles
ive
had
that
they
make
i
have
yet
to
try
a
bad
beer
from
them
drinkability
a
big
and
bold
beer
that
sure
will
be
a
lot
to
power
through
in
one
sitting
not
available
in
ohio
but
another
solid
product
from
schlafly
no
date
on
the
bottle
but
i
purchased
it
in
april
2011
poured
a
light
brown
but
still
with
light
coming
thru
the
head
settles
quickly
to
lacing
around
the
edges
i
have
let
this
one
sit
a
bit
out
of
the
fridge
and
the
aroma
is
still
a
bit
muted
to
start
with
then
it
completely
opens
up
there
is
a
sweet
toffee
along
with
maybe
some
plums
and
a
light
citrus
wow
a
lot
going
on
here
the
strong
plum
heavy
wheat
and
dark
cherry
start
of
but
then
the
booze
and
a
little
spice
take
over
to
finish
the
12
is
noticeable
for
sure
but
it
tends
to
settle
down
a
bit
i
really
like
the
light
dryness
on
the
finish
very
interesting
and
well
done
quad
glad
i
picked
one
up
on
a
road
trip
drinks
well
for
such
a
strong
beer
i
certainly
want
another
and
will
probably
get
two
to
age
great
for
the
holidays
or
a
cold
winter
night
i
think
a
year
or
so
only
did
well
by
this
bottle
i
quite
like
it
and
would
recommend
it
as
i
would
just
about
anything
by
this
brewery
o
with
the
exception
of
westy
12
im
not
a
huge
fan
of
this
style
however
i
respect
the
brewery
and
hope
they
continue
to
make
this
to
appease
those
who
do
dig
quads
2

d
this
isnt
too
bad
but
i
really
dont
like
the
vinous
character
and
the
mouthfeel
is
a
total
turn
off
overall
impression
very
rich
thick
and
good
body
im
enjoying
each
of
these
schlafly
reserve
brews
almost
every
other
night
and
have
to
say
these
are
real
get
your
hands
on
any
of
them
very
smooth
it
was
a
bit
thicker
then
i
thought
it
would
have
been
and
most
of
the
carbonation
long
ago
died
giving
it
a
somewhat
syrup
like
feel
although
significantly
lighter
very
nice
sipper
though
more
then
a
glass
is
gonna
hurt
you
in
the
end
this
was
a
monster
and
there
was
no
mistaking
it
pours
a
two
finger
cream
head
that
fades
quickly
to
a
ring
leaving
traces
of
lace
cloudy

for
a
750ml
bottle
from
colonial
spirits
acton
ma
overall
im
glad
i
got
this
as
an
extra
in
a
trade
doesnt
taste
like
any
quad
i
have
ever
had
before
and
hope
no
quad
in
the
future
o
this
is
a
quad
i
get
all
the
time
but
i
am
a
schlafly
whore
is
there
better
quads
ot
there
yes
but
at
this
price
point
schlafly
sells
it
for
it
is
worth
getting
instead
of
a
high
dollar
quad
this
is
no
quad
not
even
close
still
its
a
decent
beer
if
youre
okay
with
it
not
being
as
advertised
biggest
downfall
is
the
booziness
which
is
not
overly
discreet
o
this
is
a
totally
decent
quad
id
say
the
only
thing
i
dislike
about
it
is
the
boozy
character
to
it
maybe
this
would
improve
upon
aging
the
mouthfeel
is
a
little
thicker
than
medium
with
only
a
hint
of
the
alcohol
which
is
surprising
considering
the
high
abv
excellent
quad
that
i
would
like
to
try
with
a
little
age
on
it
as
i
expect
it
will
only
get
better
o
i
rated
this
a
4
because
its
a
good
beer
but
average
for
the
style
there
are
other
quads
worth
seeking
if
youre
looking
for
a
good
representative
of
the
style
not
a
bad
brew
and
im
glad
i
tried
it
but
probably
wont
pick
this
up
again
overall
a
decent
but
overly
sweet
quad
which
doesnt
hide
its
alcohol
all
that
well
a
nice
sipper
but
make
sure
you
have
some
folks
to
share
this
bottle
with
this
beer
is
definitely
a
sipper
the
sweetness
thickness
and
12
abv
all
take
a
toll
on
the
drinkability
but
this
is
a
good
beer
aroma
was
good
dark
fruit
belgian
yeast
and
some
sweetness
taste
is
not
the
the
st
bernadus
abt
12
category
but
still
fairly
impressive
rich
dark
fruit
definite
belgian
character
with
the
yeast
and
candi
sugar
just
not
as
complex
as
some
others
mouthfeel
is
rich
and
the
alcohol
is
fairly
well
hidden
drinkability
is
ok
for
this
strong
a
beer
solid
but
i
have
had
better
might
have
been
expecting
too
much
because
schlaflys
tripel
absolutely
blew
me
away
i
dug
this
one
probably
better
to
get
a
glass
at
a
pub
instead
of
the
whole
bomber
to
drink
but
it
is
enjoyable
missing
some
depth
but
still
very
good
d
not
very
alcoholic
tasting
but
something
lingers
on
the
palate
here
that
im
not
crazy
about
this
beer
pours
a
hazy
brown
amber
color
with
two
fingers
of
bubbly
head
that
doesnt
cling
to
the
glass
very
well
the
aroma
has
strong
nutty
malt
notes
with
some
hints
of
apple
the
taste
starts
empty
and
then
becomes
very
sweet
of
malt
and
nuts
also
has
a
fruity
note
to
it
and
a
very
strong
alcohol
taste
finishes
overcarbonated
and
leaves
a
rotten
taste
in
your
mouth
very
unimpressed
drinkability
is
hurt
a
lot
by
the
booziness
its
a
strong
beer
but
it
drinks
like
its
even
stronger
than
it
is
d
this
had
a
nice
scent
and
taste
but
it
wasnt
as
rich
or
complex
as
most
belgian
quads
typical
of
american
attempts
at
the
style
nice
body
and
decently
hidden
alcohol
so
it
wasnt
difficult
to
drink
didnt
seem
like
a
strong
candidate
for
cellaring
fresh
was
enjoyable
but
certainly
not
great
dthis
beer
will
knock
you
on
your
ass
worth
a
try
indeed
i
enjoyed
this
one
medium
to
full
bodied
mouthfeel
syrupy
average
carbonation
not
a
bad
drinker
for
being
as
big
as
it
is
drinkability
perfect
for
cold
night
under
a
bridge
when
you
cant
find
a
trash
can
fire
anywhere
the
body
has
a
great
bronze
and
reddish
hue
the
head
also
has
a
red
tint
to
it
but
is
more
of
a
tan
color
there
is
a
lot
of
staying
power
to
the
head
and
some
awesome
lace
excellent
looking
beer
it
has
very
strong
aroma
mainly
made
up
of
malty
esters
the
taste
is
very
rich
it
initially
has
a
grainy
taste
but
settles
to
some
chocolate
and
toffee
like
tones
this
beer
is
just
right
in
the
carbonation
department
and
has
medium
mouthfeel
a
nice
recreation
of
a
belgian
standard
but
doesnt
really
pop
my
palate
like
the
belgians
do
with
this
style
m
d
fluffy
and
alcoholic
the
booze
is
definitely
in
the
taste
over
the
nose
very
alcoholic
id
say
this
is
quite
drinkable
for
something
so
alcoholic
this
would
be
great
in
the
colder
seasons
i
look
forward
to
trying
it
this
fall
with
a
meal
of
tender
juicy
roast
of
beef
like
fire
in
a
glass
d
the
12
0abv
though
not
full
realized
on
the
nose
is
certainly
represented
in
the
flavor
therefore
limiting
this
to
a
slow
sipping
experience
limiting
consumption
the
bomber
i
found
was
at
the
further
end
of
the
drinking
spectrum
for
me
best
shared
with
a
friend
d
an
ok
quad
but
nothing
special
little
too
sweet
for
me
wouldnt
seek
out
again
fruit
malt
up
front
on
this
quad
followed
by
just
a
tiny
bit
of
booze
on
the
nose
a
really
nice
apple
taste
to
this
one
almost
like
biting
into
an
macintosh
apple
with
some
sourness
to
it
dry
on
finish
nice
caronation
and
smooth
body
goes
down
pretty
easy
almost
too
easy
good
drinker
i
would
revisit
this
beer
again
very
smooth
and
enjoyable
all
around
edit
as
good
as
this
beer
is
cold
it
gets
pretty
hard
to
drink
as
it
warms
it
becomes
beyond
boozy
this
hurts
the
overall
experience
of
the
beer
but
still
a
must
try
poured
a
clear
reddish
brown
color
with
an
average
fizzy
offwhite
head
that
mostly
lasted
with
excellent
lacing
moderate
to
heavy
tart
fruit
belgian
yeast
and
alcohol
aroma
medium
body
with
a
smooth
sticky
texture
and
lively
carbonation
medium
to
heavy
tart
fruit
sweet
flavor
with
a
medium
to
heavy
sweet
finish
of
moderate
to
long
duration
solid
complex
brew
a
solid
quad
i
would
drink
this
again
this
beer
did
not
taste
good
imo
it
was
super
hot
hot
hot
hot
very
dry
finish
lots
of
initial
sweetness
immediately
followed
by
very
solventlike
alcohol
this
may
improve
with
age
or
some
other
mellowing
technique
it
just
was
not
my
favorite
of
the
night
s
this
is
a
really
nice
quad
others
i
was
drinking
with
thought
it
was
almost
too
sweet
but
i
preferred
the
taste
over
some
of
the
other
quads
that
load
up
spices
or
dark
fruits
this
was
a
very
nice
example
of
a
quad
albeit
its
high
abv
and
sweetness
made
it
a
little
tough
to
take
down
after
a
while
d
pretty
easy
to
drink
tried
to
share
with
my
beer
buddy
beermantimmie
but
he
had
to
head
home
and
take
care
of
the
baby
girl
daughter
probably
will
improve
with
some
cellaring
overall
good
quality
750
ml
bottle
served
in
a

the
beer
pours
a
copperred
color
with
about
an
inch
tan
head
head
retention
is
good
but
not
much
lacing
at
all
aroma
is
very
sweet
malty
and
strong
it
smells
like
dark
fruit
figs
cherries
raisins
candy
sugar
caramel
malt
and
a
little
bit
of
booze
taste
is
similar
to
the
aroma
it
tastes

dark

yeast
brown
sugar
candy
sugar
brandy

some
bready
malt
and
spice
mouthfeelbody
is
mediumfull
its
nice
and
creamy
and
also
has
mediumhigh
but
soft
carbonation
the
smoothness
of
this
brew
makes
it
easy
to
drink
but
the
12
abv
does
have
a
kick
to
it
after
a
while
overall
i
think
its
a
good
solid
brew
its
certainly
worth
trying
by
style
its
naturally
not
overly
drinkable
with
a
high
abv
and
dense
full
body
taste
is
very
pleasant
though
making
it
a
nice
sipper
a
pretty
good
representation
of
a
quad
but
not
the
best
ive
had
overall
not
a
bad
rendition
at
all
im
guessing
that
with
a
little
age
on
it
this
could
be
really
really
good
im
gonna
pick
up
another
bottle
and
let
it
sit
for
a
while
notes
mnnnn
maybe
nothing
remarkable
about
this
large
bottle
other
than
being
a
good
reliable
offering
which
actually
speaks
volumes
good
quad
nice
us
take
on
the
style
and
will
be
happy
to
cross
paths
with
it
in
the
future
although
i
prefer
other
schlafly
offerings
almost
all
of
the
elements
in
this
glass
are
things
that
i
love
in
other
beers
when
they
are
all
together
at
the
same
time
though
it
somehow
becomes
too
messy
for
me
to
completely
enjoy
one
of
the
best
quads
i
have
had
as
belgians
go
this
beer
felt
heavy
on
my
palate
though
now
i
see
its
a
whopping
12
by
comparison
to
bush
noel
also
at
12
i
couldnt
expect
the
mouthfeel
to
be
any
lighter
in
the
context
of
a
dark
belgian
sipper
of
a
beer
this
is
pretty
decent
still
the
spicy
sweet
fig
honey
orange
peel
and
chocolate
cookie
taste
of
this
quad
while
interesting
isnt
quite
complex
enough
to
stand
up
to
the
legends
in
this
style
while
give
your
tongue
a
seemingly
endless
array
of
notes
pours
amberred
with
a
small
offwhite
head
the
aroma
is
caramel
malt
with
some
yeast
dark
fruits
and
a
little
tartness
the
flavor
is
more
of
the
same
with
some
alcohol
heavy
malts
dark
fruits
and
the
same
tart
fruit
that
i
got
in
the
aroma
medium
mouthfeel
very
solid
americanmade
quadrupel
drinkability
im
enjoying
the
unique
flavours
in
this
quadrupel
and
the
warming
is
welcome
overall
good
drinkability
despite
the
fact
that
this
will
be
only
brew
tonight
i
heartily
recommend
giving
this
one
a
go
also
picked
up
a
bottle
to
trade
should
age
nicely
d
for
12
not
too
bad
that
said
its
12
very
nice
offering
from
my
hometown
brewery
750
bottle
served
in
a
chimay
chalice
bottle
conditioned
opens
with
a
big
pop
pours
a
clear
amber
tinted
gold
lots
of
carbonation
but
only
a
finger
of
off
white
head
slightly
spice
aroma
from
yeast
a
bit
of
sugar
and
a
little
alcohol
in
the
aroma
full
bodied
and
smooth
first
sip
seems
pretty
sweet
but
that
goes
away
pretty
quickly
and
the
beer
settles
down
nice
and
malty
with
some
more
spice
in
the
finish
dangerously
drinkable
at
12
alcohol
is
well
hidden
nothing
spectacular
but
a
good
evenings
drinking
d
nothing
special
and
slightly
boozy
but
it
all
seems
to
work
together
nicely
a
wellmade
enjoyable
beer
and
one
ill
be
glad
to
pick
up
again
as
a
fan
of
schlafly
it
makes
me
a
little
proud
that
theyve
made
such
a
good
beer
drinks
pretty
easy
for
the
style
abv
they
need
to
slap
a
few
100
barrels
into
some
barrels
run
with
this
well
done
schafly
will
definitely
but
a
few
bottles
to
trade
or
lay
down
i
see
this
improving
at
least
over
the
next
23
years
for
the
style
very
well
more
than
a
couple
of
these
and
i
would
be
squinting
to
eliminate
the
second
computer
screen
from
my
inebriated
vision
schlafly
hits
home
runs
with
these
special
belgian
releases
the
color
fits
with
a
deep
brown
burgundy
plumb
colored
hue
unfortunately
the
initial
vibrant
carbonation
is
short
lived
and
makes
short
work
out
of
the
foamstand
retention
and
lacing
very
fruity
with
plumbs
raisons
dates
figs
grapes
apples
cherries
and
prunes
the
power
of
the
alcohol
make
the
fruits
taste
and
smell
as
if
they
have
been
soaked
in
rum
never
really
fusal
to
taste
or
feel
but
definately
heated
and
at
times
abrasive
think
cough
syrups
otherwise
a
fruitcake
breadiness
leads
the
way
and
provides
support
for
the
confectionate
sweetness
light
tartnessvineous
and
fruit
flavors
spicy
throughout
but
not
dry
enough
to
allow
the
phenols
to
shine
as
they
should
the
beer
is
solid
and
nice
but
the
lack
of
lasting
carbonation
leaves
the
beer
too
sweet
and
heavy
on
the
surfaces
of
the
mouth
futhermore
the
beer
just
lacks
the
depth
and
complexity
of
classic
belgian
dark
strongs
d
this
is
a
great
tasting
brew
however
it
is
alot
to
drink
needs
to
be
shared
nice
dark
brown
to
dark
red
color
not
much
head
big
aromas
coming
off
the
glass
it
smelled
fruity
and
sweet
and
the
taste
went
along
with
that
i
would
say
this
is
just
outside
my
palette
on
the
sweet
side
very
fruity
and
i
could
taste
the
alcohol
it
a
big
beer
with
a
lot
going
on
so
i
did
not
find
it
very
easy
drinking
d
very
drinkable
just
on
the
edge
of
being
too
sweet
but
not
12
no
way
not
the
equation
at
all
scary
brew
but
a
damn
fine
brew
at
only
9
a
750ml
an
absolute
steal
a
good
example
that
not
all
beers
need
the
new
fad
of
barrel
aging
not
that
the
barrels
are
a
bad
thing
i
am
drinking
this
10
months
before
its
best
after
date
a
chestnut
with
a
slight
haze
that
clears
up
as
the

some

and
some
dark

with
a

in

this
should
get
more
interesting
as
sherry
notes
develop
as
it
ages
d
this
one
had
an
interesting
thought
process
behind
it
but
the
end
result
just
didnt
pan
out
meh
and
i
dont
really
think
its
going
to
improve
a
ton
with
aging
a
little
warm
still
but
a
good
one
will
improve
im
sure
overall
this
is
a
solid
beer
due
to
the
barrel
aging
however
its
on
the
expensive
side
and
its
only
solid
beer
because
of
the
barrel
aging
the
underlying
quad
is
overly
sweet
not
interesting
and
is
average
at
best
the
rye
bourbon
barrles
15
and
wine
15
improves
the
ale
and
mellows
the
12
abv
but
neither
of
the
barrels
are
very
distinct
making
a
below
average
beer
slightly
above
average
this
will
mellow
more
with
some
age
but
the
already
minimal

characteristics
will
fade

expected
a
little
bit
more
from
this
beer
but
it
doesnt
seem
like
its
ready
yet
little
bit
of
the
sweetness
would
be
interested
to
see
how
this
ages
mf
great
feel
smooth
med
heavy
definitely
not
dry
almost
cloying
it
is
so
sweet
that
sort
of
slick
syrupy
feel
first
of
the
night
steaks
on
the
grill
for
ravenspats
game
black
wax
cap
then
poured
into
a
chalice
awesome
all
around
worth
the
price
get
some
red
wine
with
a
sugary
sweet
aroma
very
short
lived
head
on
the
beer
and
a
nice
darker
red
body
more
blood
red
then
your
red
from
darker
crystal
malts
the
beer
had
a
pleasant
sweet
wine
flavor
that
had
a
slightly
astringent
almost
spicy
flavor
on
the
finish
slightly
tart
and
bubbly
at
the
same
time
the
overall
mouth
feel
was
dry
for
the
flavor
at
the
start
and
after
the
flavor
diminished
the
beer
had
this
thick
cloying
covering
the
beer
felt
like
the
wine
had
coated
and
dried
on
your
tongue
like
a
paste
the
complexity
in
flavor
mouth
feel
and
aroma
is
amazing
i
must
say
i
enjoyed
this
beer
more
at
the
start
and
the
last
few
sips
were
not
as
good
as
the
first
v
extremely
expensive
at
almost
17
dollars
for
a
22oz
bomber
but
definitely
worth
trying
at
least
once
belgian
fans
will
want
to
buy
a
few
to
cellar
and
let
age
for
a
special
occasion
dark
brown
in
color
with
small

sweet
malty

wonderful
robust
taste
sweet
malty
i
could
drink
this
beer
all
night
cheers
you
filthy
maniacs
deeply
fruity
and
sweetly
alcoholic
in
a
headspinning
way
an
interesting
brew
to
sip
hardly
worth
the
price
though
from
the
22
oz
bottle
purchased
at
litickers
liquor
in
san
diego
very
tasty
great
quad
world
class
really
tasty
beer
but
whats
up
with
all
the
pomegranate
stuff
happening
with
these
guys
it
seems
to
be
in
more
and
more
of
their
beers
it
adds
a
cool
sweet
and
tangy
character
to
this
quad
which
is
lighter
in
color
and
malt
toast
and
caramelization
than
others
but
still
has
a
nice
rich
malt
sweet
base
and
not
overly
intense
on
the
belgian
aspect
more
of
a
barleywine
meets
a
quad
than
anything
else
the
wine
barrel
gives
a
little
tannic
thing
that
goes
great
with
the
tang
of
the
pomegranate
molasses
and
the
rye
barrel
gives
it
a
sweet
vanilla
whiskey
thing
that
works
with
the
malt
richness
great
depth
to
this
really
really
good
im
not
sure
how
different
it
is
than
the
stoic
its
been
a
real
long
time
since
i
have
had
the
original
wonderful
winter
beer
fit
for
long
ageing
and
really
one
of
the
more
unique
takes
on
the
style
not
much
booze
poking
through
here
either
which
is
real
impressive
deschutes
won
my
respect
long
ago
but
it
gets
reinforced
every
time
i
have
a
new
beer
from
them
this
is
like
no
other
overall
a
pretty
interesting
quad
and
very
enjoyable
complex
winter
figs
warm
from
the
finely
dialed
in
alcohol
burn
yum
good
clean
dark
heavy
enjoyed
from
a
growler
in
a
snifter
this
fantastic
quad
pours
a
cloudy
brownish
orange
with
little
to
no
head
or
lacing
nose
of
plums
brown
sugar
raisin
light
floral
hops
and
a
brandy
like
alcohol
flavors
are
complex
to
say
the
least
plum
and
pomegranate
to
the
front
and
sides
best
representation
of
pomegranate
i
have
tasted
thus
far
tons
of
brown
sugar
goodness
with
rye
barrel
coming
through
on
the
back
blending
to
make
a
brandy
like
quality
intriguing
moderate
carbonation
slick
mouth
feel
and
a
wet
finish
with
alcohol
warmth
fantastic
worth
getting
more
in
a
bottle
to
lay
down
for
a
time
o
this
beer
is
delicious
this
is
why
i
drink
beer
i
want
complex
flavors
and
this
beer
delivers
for
me
i
have
to
get
back
to
the
store
and
pick
up
a
couple
more
of
these
bottle
review
had
it
later
on
tap
and
didnt
like
it
quite
as
much
for
some
reason
the
aroma
reminded
me
very
much
of
your
stereotypical
barleywine
there
was
also
brown
sugar
mollasses
pomegranate
cherry
cranberry
raisins
and
booze
poured
a
deep
ruby
brown
color
with
a
tan
head
that
receded
quickly
had
a
great
full
body
while
stil
feeling
kinda
light
in
the
mouth
on
the
palate
there
was
molasses
dark
fruits
raisins
brown
sugar
wine
oak
and
booze
this
is
a
beer
i
can
see
aging
well
and
i
cant
wait
to
have
it
again
in
a
year
as
it
stands
now
though
i
thought
it
was
absolutely
fantastic
im
a
big
fan
o
a
solid
beer
overall
but
doesnt
quite
nail
the
depth
and
is
a
bit
too
boozy
this
would
be
a
good
one
to
stick
away
for
a
few
years
overall
a
pretty
good
barrel
aged
belgian
a
killer
deal
for
9
99
this
craft
demands
you
take
time
with
it
and
i
am
very
nice
indeed
overall
big
tasty
be
cautious
creeps
up
on
you
will
buy
again
outstanding
quad
in
fact
only
boulevards
bbq
would
beat
this
out
for
best
u
s
made
quad
that
i
have
had
lovely
rubredbrown
color
decent
bloom
with
definite
lacing
deep
rich
malty
notes
a
decadent
but
highly
drinkable
and
dangerous
beer
surprising
actually
since
i
have
not
been
fond
of
all
of
deschutes
more
ambitious
beers
low
b
o
just
not
too
much
to
get
excited
with
here
for
me
missed
a
lot
on
this
beer
for
me
very
nice
on
the
nose
with
the
cranberrypomegranate
smell
but
the
complexity
ends
after
that
its
a
basic
quad
that
drinks
well
this
one
is
just
okay
for
what
ive
had
out
of
other
quads
both
foreign
domestic
delicious
now
to
buy
a
bottle
and
put
some
age
on
it
the
barrel
aging
and
blending
adds
a
bit
of
complexity
mouthfeel
is
a
bit
thin
and
not
picking
up
the
pronounced
raisin
aroma
and
taste
i
expect
for
the
style
the
use
of
rye
barrels
added
a
bit
of
spiciness
which
was
nice
could
definitely
use
some
cellaring
goes
down
fairly
easy
but
interesting
this
beers
best
days
are
ahead
of
it
but
cant
find
much
fault
with
the
taste
right

yes
the
stoic
and
pours
a
ruby
brown
hue
with
a
two
finger
creamy
head
and
some
tight
leggy
lacing
the
smell
is
oaked
whiskey

the
mouthfeel
is
full
bodied
smooth
and
moderately
carbonated
with
tastes
of
tart
cherries
molasses
a
slight
hit
of
pomegranate
whiskey
and
finished
with
a
pinot
noir
bitter
sweetness
and
overall
its
very
exspensive
but
i
couldnt
resist
with
the
different
blends
of
barrel
ageing
and
definitely
enjoyed
it
the
once
cheers
overall
this
version
of
deschuted
quad
is
definitely
much
better
than
the
first
effort
the
barrel
blending
is
a
nice
spin
on
the
style
and
definitely
enhances
this
brew
i
believe
i
am
going
back
to
get
another
bottle
and
letting
it
rest
for
a
year
or
so
dark
fruit
light
caramel
pretty
mild
o
i
liked
this
more
than
the
stoic
but
they
were
similar
beers
interesting
when
compared
sidebyside
i
would
recommend
this
beer
o
solid
american
interpretation
of
a
belgian
quad
very
easy
drinking
definitely
one
of
the
better
us
made
quads
i
have
had
this
one
has
a
best
after
date
so
i
feel
i
am
reviewing
a
more
fresh
and
unaged
sample
it
does
show
while
very
good
the
beer
likes
the
refinement
of
the
best
quads
i
am
very
tempted
to
get
another
bottle
of
this
and
let
it
sit
for
a
year
to
compare
the
difference
i
think
if
aging
smooths
it
out
this
will
change
from
a
very
good
beer
to
a
truly
outstanding
one
taste
is
immediately
noticeably
sweet
the
plum
that
played
on
the
nose
is
very
present
on
the
taste
buds
as
well
there
is
also
a
very
strong
sweet
bread
feel
going
on
here
there
is
a
bit
of
a
sherry
character
and
noticeable
alcohol
but
not
in
a
bad
way
flavor
is
nicely
complex
and
very
easy
to
drink
for
the
alcohol
content
i
will
look
for
this
in
bottle
form
because
i
would
be
very
interested
to
see
how
this
one
ages
complex
original
pretty
tasty
nonplussed
good
beer
wow
what
a
great
beer
i
am
somewhat
limited
in
my
experience
of
quads
but
from
what
the
style
has
to
offer
this
is
one
of
the
better
ones
that
ive
had
a
complex
beer
with
extremely
high
drinkability
the
beer
has
a
sweet
but
balanced
entry
sweet
with
residual
sugars
raisin
prune
i
picked
up
some
nice
grape
notes
as
well
not
sure
ive
had
that
in
a
quad
beforewelcomed
though
as
the
brew
warmed
poured
at
about
50f
the
brown
sugar
cinammon
and
molasses
became
more
present
the
sweetness
is
present
from
entry
to
finish
i
didnt
find
it
cloying
or
overbearing
i
am
a
huge
saison
fan
so
i
dont
particularly
care
for
sweet
beers
i
did
not
find
it
to
be
too
sweet
i
really
dig
the
estery
min
clove
and
spiciness
from
the
belgian
yeast
there
is
a
nice
sweet
bready
and
soft
bitter
finish
to
the
brew
the
beer
is
thin
bodied
alcohol
is
well
masked
with
only
a
slight
warming
effect
upon
consumption
to
me
the
beer
drinks
like
a
78
eventhough
its
a
12
percenter
i
thoroughly
enjoyed
the
beer
have
one
if
you
can
spicy
warm
and
continuing
savory
flavors
seep
deep
into
the
tastebuds
and
are
reluctant
to
release
saturating
the
late
taste
with
dessert
like
effects
that
render
the
ale
as
a
sipping
after
dinner
delight
its
full
upstart
finishes
maltysweet
with
balancing
vinous
and
whisky
spice
that
play
onward
well
into
the
next
sip
pours
an
opaque
deep
brown
with
modest
khaki
head
aroma
is
dominated
by
molasses
raisins
rum
and
dark
cherries
somewhat
subtle
initially
flavor
is
sweeter
throughout
with
a
toasted
malt
base
that
finishes
a
little
dry
the
underlying
tart
cherry
contrast
nicely
notes
of
raisins
and
dates
are
young
and
should
open
well
with
time
i
really
like
the
tart
contrasting
notes
though
i
could
do
without
banana
esters
overall
this
has
a
lot
going
for
it
but
would
be
better
if
the
sweetness
was
toned
down
great
take
on
the
quad
the
base
beer
shine
early
on
and
then
gets
amped
up
by
the
barrel
notes
overall
a
really
good
twist
on
the
belgian
quad
style
the
rye
whiskey
and
wine
barrels
add
a
nice
kick
to
a
very
good
dark
fruit
rich
base
o
a
good
beer
but
not
worthy
of
the
deschutes
reserve
family
overall
a
very
complex
ale
definitely
drink
this
one
as
it
warms
to
get
the
whole
transformation
from
dark
fruit
rich
belgian
beer
to
a
strong
boozy
mix
of
rye
and
wine
with
a
touch
of
molasses
cant
wait
till
that
best
after
date
for
my
next
one
this
is
the
first
beer
ive
had
with
a
best
after
date
on
the
bottle
its
great
now
ill
have
to
buy
another
bottle
and
age
it
overall
a
very
tasty
beer
that
was
good
enough
for
me
to
buy
a
second
bottle
to
see
how
it
tastes
at
its
best
its
been
a
long
time
since
i
had
the
original
stoic
but
if
my
memory
is
correct
i
think
i
prefer
this
one
a
little
better
of
course
my
palate
has
likely
changed
a
great
deal
since
then
anyway
so
its
probably
an
irrelevant
distinction
ultimately
this
is
a
well
done
beer
as
long
as
you
arent
expecting
a
traditional
quad
this
is
a
very
interesting
beer
with
both
tart
and
oak
boubon
notes
ill
probably
grab
another
to
age
pours
a
clear
copper
with
a
foamy
bone
head
that
settles
to
wisps
of
film
on
top
of
the
beer
small
dots
of
lace
form
around
the
glass
on
the
drink
down
smell
is
of
malt
brown
sugar
fruit
and
yeast
aromas
taste
is
much
the
same
with
malt
brown
sugar
and
fruit
flavors
on
the
finish
there
is
a
mild
amount
of
yeast
bitterness
and
an
alcohol
kick
on
the
palate
with
each
sip
this
beer
has
a
lower
level
of
carbonation
with
a
slightly
crisp
mouthfeel
overall
this
is
a
pretty
good
beer
that
is
solid
but
quite
boozy
at
this
time
hey
ya
got
any
grapes
this
brew
falls
short
of
what
im
accustomed
to
from
deschutes
questioning
if
i
can
recommend
1522oz
i
guess
its
worth
a
pass
o
nice
quad
no
real
sign
of
the
wine
just
the
rye
whiskey
to
me
nice
complexity
and
strength
but
surprisingly
smooth
and
easy
drinking
for
over
12
abv
lots
of
cola
chocolate
and
fruit
in
this
one
really
enjoyable
overall
not
bad
in
fact
pretty
good
a
bit
too
dark
fruit
and
sugary
sweetness
for
my
liking
but
thats
what
you
get
with
a
quad
and
there
wasnt
too
much
to
turn
me
off
completely
glad
i
tried
it
on
tap
but
the
price
on
the
bottle
i
saw
at
the
store
the
next
day
frightened
me
off
from
buying
it
i
liked
it
didnt
like
it
that
much
tossing
the
barrel
aging
aside
i
think
it
meets
the
style
nicely
i
could
have
used
this
brew
during
the
very
brutal
winter
we
had
ill
buy
more
pear
and
caramel
taste
is
outstanding
rivaling
the
belgian
quadsrupels
it
definitely
has
persistent
notes
of
red
grapes
from
the
wine
barrels
it
was
aged
in
to
add
to
the
richness
although
not
as
thick
ar
intense
as
a
typical
trappist
quad
like
abt
12
i
actually
prefer
this
version
of
the
style
the
complex
fruit
and
sweetness
tantalize
the
palate
instead
of
overpowering
it
if
it
wasnt
such
a
high
abv
i
could
easily
drink
a
few
of
these
the
beer
is
good
in
its
flavors
and
aromas
but
the
mouthfeel
drags
it
down
a
bit
some
booziness
is
present
which
compared
to
say
a
rochefort
or
westy
that
show
almost
no
booze
also
doesnt
help
the
beer
out
but
i
must
refrain
from
comparing
this
to
belgian
classics
and
take
it
for
what
it
is
a
partly
barrel
aged
american
interpretation
tasty
but
not
world
class
o
very
nice
with
an
emphasis
more
on
fruit
than
melanoidans
on
the
sweet
side
but
a
nice
twist
on
a
quad
overall
an
awesome
beer
been
waiting
to
try
this
for
a
while
now
glad
i
had
a
chance
to
have
it
on
tap
if
you
have
not
had
this
beer
and
are
able
to
get
a
it
either
on
tap
or
in
the
bottle
do
yourself
a
favor
and
grab
some
cheers
that
taste
really
fires
up
my
senses
because
if
its
dark
malt
licorice
and
pomegranate
notes
alcohol
is
very
well
integrated
into
the
beer
youd
barely
know
it
was
there
except
at
the
finish
your
head
when
you
get
a
little
woozy
a
sipper
or
sure
but
a
delightful
one
overall
a
lot
of
great
flavors
here
not
too
much
bourbonbarrel
flavors
but
enough
to
notice
it
more
american
quad
than
belgian
quad
this
is
just
an
all
around
amazing
beer
with
a
ton
going
for
it
yum
i
hope
its
as
good
in
the
bottle
an
impressive
effort
from
deschutes
though
the
sweetness
and
high
alcohol
definitely
wears
on
you
are
a
while
got
an
8
ounce
pour
at
the
tg
and
that
was
more
than
enough
for
me
great
beer
but
a
little
bit
goes
a
long
way
d
this
was
a
fantastic
brew
with
tons
of
complexity
and
depth
in
the
scent
and
taste
the
body
was
solid
and
the
finish
was
fairly
smooth
it
did
pack
some
heat
so
it
was
much
better
to
sip
would
probably
improve
with
age
wonderful
beer
one
of
the
best
of
the
style
o
awesome
barrel
aged
quad
with
lots
of
interesting
things
going
on
so
glad
i
got
to
have
this
on
draft
and
got
a
bottle
will
definitely
be
searching
out
more
to
store
away

along

line

a

strong

hybrid
enjoyable

not

just
really
well
done
everything
comes
together
well
good

with

its
my
favorite
drink
the
hue

hummed
the
body
is
not

sweet
chewy
but
subtly
dry
wonderful
phenols
from
the
yeast
i
miss
this
drink
great
beer
overall
maybe
slightly
past
its
prime
i
slightly
wish
i
had
it
this
summer
because
it
has
a
lot
of
refreshing
qualities
but
its
a
good
quad
i
like
it
a
lot
thanks
geoff
for
the
recommendation
and
trade
a
solid
brew
that
im
really
glad
to
say
ifve
tried
o
this
beer
is
one
smooth
sipper
with
great
flavors
that
blend
and
play
well
together
it
stood
up
well
even
though
this
one
has
a
best
before
date
instead
of
a
best
after
date
overall
4
0
an
interesting
take
on
a
quad
at
this
point
in
time
i
dont
really
get
a
lot
of
the
quintessential
dark
fruits
that
you
expect
from
a
belgian
quad
but
this
one
steps
a
little
outside
the
box
with
the
use
of
pomegranate
molasses
and
being
partially
aged
in
wine
and
rye
barrels
its
hard
to
compare
with
not
the
stoic
given
the
time
lapse
but
this
one
has
held
up
quite
nicely
especially
for
being
over
two
years
past
the
enjoy
by
date
o
a
bit
of
a
disappointment
but
its
still
a
pretty
good
beer
i
would
recommend
this
but
it
doesnt
really
taste
like
you
would
think
it
would
based
on
the
description
barrel
aged
quad
amazing
belgian
yeast
actually
a
pretty
light
touch
along
with
some
strong
sweetness
from
the
malt
sweet
like
a
good
barleywine
would
be
a
sweetness
that
seems
totally
natural
in
this
context
most
beers
that
are
in
the
style
dont
choose
to
go
so
sweet
but
for
this
beer
it
really
really
works
absolutely
my

oh
well
cellared
upon
release
this
was
my
first
one
not
a
quad
by
my
book
at
all
but
as
bspa
i
really
thought
it
was
good
i
liked
the
play
of
the
fruit
with
the
robust
yet
clean
alcohol
character
the
barrel
play
was
modest
but
suited
the
malt
bill
not
what
i
was
expected
but
solid
belgian
style
ale
im
curious
how
my
other
bottle
will
age
but
i
probably
wont
want
it
to
loose
all
the
fruit
and
therefore
dont
have
high
expectations
for
longer
term
ill
check
back
in
within
23
years
the
beer
pours
a
hazyspeckled
dark
amber
with
a
creamy
offwhite
head
that
laces
the
nose
has
huge
notes
of
plumb
tart
cherries
cherry
blossoms
and
malt
the
taste
presents
the
same
bold
stone
fruits
upfront
with
a
blast
of
warm
booze
soaked
grains
in
the
finish
the
body
is
a
bit
lighter
than
other
quads
comparatively
but
well
carbonated
fruity
bready
and
has
masked
booze
in
the
finish
the
aftertaste
is
bitterrindy
and
a
bit
off
putting
but
certainly
doesnt
ruin
the
beer
considering
the
priceavailability
and
all
additional
components
of
this
review
id
say
this
quad
is
worthy
of
a
try
but
not
more
impressive
than
a
3
philosophers
for
instance
pours
a
cloudy
coppergolden
color
14
inch
head
of
an
offwhite
color
decent
retention
and
slight
lacing
smells
of
sweet
malt
yeast
hint
of
grape
slight
raspberry
alcohol
and
a
hint
of
wheat
fits
the
style
of
a
quadrupel
mouth
feel
is
sharp
and
clean
with
an
average
carbonation
level
tastes
of
alcohol
yeast
grapes
hint
of
citrus
sweet
malt
and
a
hint
of
spice
overall
alcohol
is
not
overpowering
which
i
enjoy
the
body
at
first
reminded
me
of
a
blend
of
lindemans
framboise
and
kwak
weak
appearance
and
complexity
but
good
aroma
body
and
blend
o
interesting
take
on
the
belgian
quad
but
ultimately
disappointing
for
what
i
was
expecting
good
but
not
great
for
such
a
hardtofind
beer
youd
expect
it
to
be
a
little
more
representative
of
the
style
d
it
wont
satisfy
your
craving
if
youre
looking
for
a
typical
quad
but
its
one
hell
of
a
beer
insanely
drinkable
at
11
ill
be
having
it
again
o
definitely
odd
for
a
quad
nothing
really
remarkable
about
it
except
the
odd
flavors
definitely
disappointing
for
one
of
deschutess
reserve
beers
outside
impressions
of
this
beer
had
me
worried
a
year
after
acquiring
this
one
its
time
to
crack
it
open
this
is
a
quad
with
almost
no
belgian
flair
to
it
if
uncategorized
its
a
complex
beer
mixing
lightly
toasted
and
sweet
malt
oak
and
lightly
sour
fruit
aspects
rather
than
stoic
and
rigid
this
beer
dances
over
the
confines
of
the
definition
quad
and
delivers
a
delightful
sensory
experience
overall
a
very
nice
quad
definitely
has
plenty
of
belgian
quad
qualities
but
it
is
significantly
different
from
any
quad
i
have
had
the
pomegranate
definitely
adds
some
interesting
qualities
and
gives
it
some
interesting
funk
a
lovely
beer
o
i
think
i
would
have
enjoyed
it
slightly
better
in
its
prime
but
a
very
good
belgian
one
of
the
best
ive
had
from
a
large
american
brewery
easy
to
tell
that
it
was
done
with
a
vast
amount
of
precision
and
care
i
hope
this
isnt
just
a
one
time
release
so
i
can
see
what
they
do
with
it
again
the
nose
matches
and
compliments
the
taste
very
well
and
it
overall
has
a
nice
amount
of
complexity
to
it
that
doesnt
stray
too
far
in
any
direction
this
poured
out
as
a
light
brown
color
with
a
nice
looking
white
head
on
top
the
retention
is
pretty
good
as
well
as
the
lacing
the
smell
of
the
beer
gives
off
some
quad
like
aromas
there
is
some
fruity
and
bready
aromas
the
barrel
aging
aromas
are
prominent
the
taste
of
the
beer
has
a
slight
tartness
to
it
the
flavors
of
dark
fruits
come
out
with
some
oak
elements
in
there
also
the
mouthfeel
had
a
solid
amount
to
carbonation
the
body
is
a
little
on
the
thin
side
overall
its
a
decent
quad
the
color
is
a
little
on
the
light
side
and
is
need
a
little
more
body
deep
orange
colour
ring
of
white
head
some
lace
as
well
smell
is
quite
oaky
fruity
and
vinous
quite
a
bit
of
funk
and
a
bit
of
musty
brett
presumably
from
the
wine
barrels
some
candy
apple
present
as
well
taste
is
yeasty
and
fruity
apple
followed
by
oak
and
some
funk
brett
more
fruit
toward
the
finish
and
maybe
a
hint
of
whisky
however
it
does
get
buried
by
tons
of
fruit
and
funky
oak
here
lightmedium
carbonation
medium
feel
this
was
quite
a
nice
and
certainly
interesting
brew
not
a
quad
in
my
books
but
certainly
a
pleasure
to
have
had
good
beer
but
not
your
fathers
quad
rather
mid
yellow
with
big
lasting
head
lace
sweet
and
some
tartness
from
the
pomegranate
overall
i
get
more
berry
than
pomegranate
complex
sweet
dominates
but
it
is
not
cloying
smooth
mouthfeel
and
good
drinkability
thanks
presario
overall
its
an
odd
quad
the
wine
barrels
are
still
noticeable
but
i
cant
find
any
whiskey
except
for
what
is
questionably
a
whisky
burn
way
beyond
the
after
taste
of
my
palette
o
im
loving
this
quad
much
more
than
the
belgians
ive
had
pours
a
hazy
golden
with
a
little
bit
of
an
orange
tint
a
white
head
that
quickly
recedes
aroma
offers
some
belgian
yeast
giving
off
some
fruity
esters
big
bananasome
apple
and
then
theres
the
pomegranate
giving
off
some
nice
tartness
the
barrels
and
some
alcohol
flavor
is
really
quite
interesting
you
get
the
typcial
belgian
quad
flavors
with
the
yeast
and
its
fruity
esters
largely
banana
but
you
also
get
the
pomegranate
which
cuts
the
sweetness
and
offers
some
tartness
to
this
thing
and
then
some
discrete
woodiness
some
alcohol
in
the
finish
but
not
too
bad
given
the
earlier
reviews
here
time
must
have
tamed
it
some
a
fuller
mouthfeel
some
creaminess
not
much
activity
overall
i
liked
this
one
a
lot
more
upon
my
first
few
sips
than
i
did
on
my
last
few
sips
i
shared
this
bottle
with
someone
else
and
glad
i
did
because
i
couldnt
have
drank
more
than
the
12
ozs
i
got
i
guess
id
consider
an
alright
brew
in
small
portions
but
the
fact
that
it
got
a
little
cloying
for
me
the
more
of
it
i
drank
was
definitely
a
let
down
interesting
beer
yes
good
beer
not
as
much
so
an
interesting
quad
definitely
more
fruity
than
most
so
if
fruit
in
a
beer
is
a
turnoff
to
you
you
might
want
to
avoid
this
one
o
a
great
beer
and
an
exceptional
quad
highly
recommend
to
and
drinkable
by
all
will
have
again
i
dont
really
think
this
is
a
quad
but
i
dont
know
what
kind
of
label
it
deserves
its
boozy
and
fruity
but
in
a
good
way
im
not
sure
how
to
rate
this
but
i
guess
i
will
be
nice
at
the
very
least
this
is
very
interesting
i
cant
view
this
as
a
quad
its
a
loose
use
of
the
term
and
as
such
i
treated
the
beer
as
some
imagined
belgianamerican
strong
ale
pours
a
medium
amber
color
with
a
huge
bubbly
white
ehad
that
slowly
dissipates
leaving
much
lace
smells
of
tart
fruit
spicy
oak
tannins
orange
peel
yeasty
funk
and
a
bit
of
grape
skins
it
doesnt
look
or
smell
like
what
i
expected
the
flavor
is
moderately
sweet
with
some
light
sugar
a
bit
of
apples
some
non
descript
tart
fruit
a
hint
of
caramel
some
wine
like
tannins
grape
skins
and
a
fair
shot
of
ethanol
theres
a
hint
of
vanilla
and
oak
in
the
flavor
but
they
are
very
subtle
medium
body
with
a
moderate
level
of
carbonation
and
a
sweet
bubbly
mouthfeel
this
is
an
ok
beer
but
i
didnt
love
it
thats
for
sure
i
think
the
pomegranate
adds
a
fruity
tartness
that
makes
it
feel
a
bit
like
a
sour
bottle
the
wine
barrel
adds
to
this
as
well
i
was
expecting
a
dark
caramel
and
raisin
beer
with
maybe
some
hints
of
barrel
and
tart
fruit
what
i
tasted
was
a
tart
fruity
belgian
with
hints
of
caramel
and
pomme
fruits
unbelievable
im
not
sure
if
this
beer
it
that
remarkable
or
if
its
my
love
of
quads
coming
through
after
not
having
had
one
in
awhile
the
look
the
smell
the
flavors
the
texture
it
has
it
all
i
have
to
say
it
is
a
5
0
this
looks
unusual
for
a
quad
smells
nice
though
the
beer
in
its
entirety
is
uninspiring
it
was
nice
to
drink
but
not
interesting
enough
to
distract
me
to
go
write
down
some
notes
about
it
as
i
worked
on
other
things
slightly
boozy
with
a
bit
of
a
burn
the
pomegranate
provides
an
interesting
touch
but
only
a
one
dimensional
one
if
this
is
a
quad
okay
i
can
roll
with
that
i
guess
overall
though
its
not
very
interesting
a
brewery
like
deschutes
has
earned
my
respect
by
producing
a
lot
of
interesting
beers
that
i
really
enjoy
however
this
is
not
one
of
them
a
miss
in
my
book
really
didnt
like
this
one
as
much
as
the
folks
at
the
bar
had
me
anticipating
its
really
really
strong
the
complex
flavor
helps
hide
it
a
little
but
between
the
tartness
and
the
banana
yeasty
inyourface
flavor
i
couldnt
even
put
the
whole
thing
down
granted
im
not
a
huge
fan
of
the
style
but
i
know
ive
had
better
maybe
i
expect
deschutes
to
knock
it
out
of
the
park
every
time
and
i
feel
slightly
disappointed
notes
nice
brew
no
flaws
really
but
the
barrel
felt
short
of
the
delicate
notes
it
promised
and
similarly
the
same
went
for
the
addition
of
fruit
overall
i
would
certainly
recommend
trying
this
beer
although
i
think
i
expected
too
much
out
of
it
given
the
price
tag
and
the
past
brewery
performance
i
was
expecting
something
phenomenal
but
it
was
just
a
decent
quad
certainly
not
three
philosophers
ill
tell
you
that
worth
a
try
though
the
flavor
is
complex
the
pomegranate
has
a
nice
platform
as
the
fruity
note
with
nice
belgian
yeast
and
a
healthy
brown
sugar
and
toffee
like
sweetness
a
nice
dryness
and
also
a
healthy
depth
of
flavor
at
the
same
time
vanilla
its
complex
but
at
the
same
time
it
doesnt
seem
to
have
the
direction
and
sofistication
of
the
big
belgian
quads
but
its
still
nice
but
a
touch
muddled
taste
has
mellowed
since
it
was
released
a
bit
and
the
flavors
have
come
together
a
little
bit
better
i
like
the
bready
aspect
the
malt
gives
off
despite
the
light
color
the
flavors
are
still
a
bit
odd
together
though
and
i
think
the
abv
is
unnecessarily
high
at
11
the
pomegranate
seems
to
clash
a
bit
with
the
soft
yeast
and
propagates
an
alcoholic
feel
if
you
want
something
different
this
is
your
beer
i
am
not
a
huge
fan
it
though
especially
for
a
deschutes
specialty
brew
d
very
drinkable
nice
balance
of
flavors
and
the
barrel
aging
adds
to
the
beer
nicely
not
really
a
quad
but
still
very
tasty
a
great
beer
that
i
think
just
has
too
much
going
on
if
youre
seeking
a
runofthemill
belgian
style
quad
if
you
know
what
to
expect
though
youll
keep
coming
back
for
more
overall
i
didnt
like
it
it
really
isnt
very
representative
of
the
style
in
my
opinion
and
where
it
diverges
from
the
norm
it
does
so
in
ways
that
i
personally
find
unpleasant
i
seriously
considered
tossing
it
out
after
the
first
sip
which
is
something
i
never
do
to
be
fair
it
did
grow
on
me
a
bit
over
the
course
of
the
bottle
which
may
have
something
to
do
with
the
high
alcohol
content
it
doesnt
taste
nearly
as
strong
as
it
actually
is
to
each
his
own
i
suppose
but
i
wont
be
buying
it
again
drink
it
up
a
super
solid
quad
with
a
barrel
aged
twist
i
would
buy
this
again
age
it
just
to
see
how
that
rolls
m
its
not
full
more
medium
overall
the
beer
is
rather
enjoyable
it
just
does
not
mesh
with
what
my
idea
of
a
quad
is
very
well
it
is
pale
there
are
no
toffee
caramel
dark
fruit
or
other
typical
quad
flavors
present
the
beer
states
on
the
label
that
it
was
made
with
pomegranates
they
do
not
come
through
at
all
however
this
is
still
a
great
beer
and
i
would
highly
recommend
it
o
a
very
unique
and
very
tasty
quad
the
additions
made
by
deschutes
by
aging
the
beer
in
barrels
and
adding
pomegranate
really
stand
out
and
make
this
a
beer
unlike
any
other
i
have
had
there
is
only
a
hint
of
alcohol
in
this
11
beer
i
will
look
forward
to
this
each
year
a
major
failure
from
a
consistantly
solid
brewery
do
everything
in
your
power
to
stay
far
far
away
from
this
train
wreck
in
a
bottle
overall
a
unique
beer
not
a
quad
in
my
book
no
clue
as
to
what
this
really
is
stylewise
but
i
kind
of
like
it
somewhat
drinkable
o
enjoyed
this
more
when
stirring
up
the
yeast
sediment
for
the
second
pour
it
added
a
good
funkslight
sour
and
more
spiciness
glad
i
let
this
sit
outside
of
the
fridge
a
while
as
it
gets
better
as
it
warms
the
mouthfeel
is
medium
bodied
with
carbonation
being
moderate
overall
it
was
a
decent
and
interesting
beer
but
not
one
that
really
stands
out
the
sweet
sugary
fruitiness
and
spice
dominated
a
little
too
much
and
seemed
to
overshadow
some
of
the
flavors
i
was
looking
forward
to
unfortunately
o
complex
and
flavourful
incredibly
and
dangerously
drinkable
at
11
and
all
around
world
class
certainly
a
fruitier
take
on
the
style
so
if
youre
not
into
the
sweetness
you
might
not
find
it
as
enjoyable
i
on
the
other
hand
wish
all
quads
had
this
sweetness
to
them
delicious
the
stoic
is
one
heck
of
an
interesting
beer
pours
murky
light
amber
color
with
a
slight
pink
tint
and
an
effervescent
white
head
looks
much
lighter
than
most
quads
ive
had
coming
in
almost
honey
colored
rather
than
that
deep
caramel
color
im
accustomed
to
in
these
it
smells
tart
and
sour
yeasty
and
lots
of
fresh
fruit
the
flavor
is
much
more
tempered
by
the
wood
aging
and
the
rye
flavors
come
through
very
nicely
and
compliment
the
tartness
of
the
pomegranates
never
really
tasted
anything
quite
like
this
its
oaky
almost
sour
and
even
flowery
in
the
yeast
feel
is
very
excited
carbonation
and
a
lighter
to
medium
body
alcohol
flavor
and
feel
is
entirely
absent
amazing
this
would
be
quite
drinkable
except
for
the
abv
strength
overall
another
exceptional
beer
from
deschutes
theyve
got
to
be
one
of
the
finest
operations
in
the
country
o
similar
to
a
lightly
spiced
holiday
dessert
wine
the
stoic
exudes
significant
complexity
within
its
extensive
production
process
this
classic
style
undergoes
a
wonderful
transformation
into
an
elegant
sipping
beer
with
a
broad
depth
of
unique
flavors
to
satisfy
even
the
most
discerning
palate
i
have
had
this
beer
before
but
it
still
surprised
me
how
light
it
pours
gold
with
just
a
touch
of
orange
and
a
very
small
white
head
that
recedes
quickly
the
aroma
is
very
sweet
lots
of
complex
fruity
belgian
yeast
esters
lots
of
berries
overripe
strawberries
blueberries
slightly
acidic
smelling
but
not
in
a
sour
way
some
definite
light
caramel
maltiness
in
the
background
and
a
touch
of
oaky
tannins
the
taste
is
nice
similar
to
the
aroma
but
slightly
more
muted
not
as
bright
very
light
bitterness
just
enough
to
balance
the
high

the
mouthfeel
is

smooth

overall
a
friend
shared
a
bottle
of
this
a
while
back
and
i
decided
to
pick
up
a
bottle
for
myself
not
quite
as
good
as
the
top
level
belgian
quads
but
a
very
decent
american
attempt
at
the
style
sweet
and
boozy
vinous
and
raw
more
bourbon
burn
than
i
was
expecting
and
not
as
much
flavor
as
i
was
hoping
a
rare
miss
from
this
brewery
for
me
i
like
deschutes
a
lot
and
everything
ive
ever
had
from
them
has
been
amazing
but
this
doesnt
do
it
for
me
i
finished
but
it
was
work
poured
from
a
22oz
bottle
into
a
goblet
best
by
80412
this
pours
a
slightly
hazy
golden
color
with
a
short
lived
white
head
the
smells
are
of
belgian
yeast
esters
banana
brown
sugar
other
malts
the
feel
is
medium
a
little
tingly
the
taste
is
disappointing
a
little
yeast
some
sugar
some
bitterness
update
read
some
other
reviews
and
something
is
off
seems
that
some
people
got
the
cloudy
with
and
without
the
yeast
mine
was
clear
with
nothing
remaining
in
the
bottle
at
all
overall
this
is
a
decent
belgian
golden
strong
but
definitely
not
a
quad
to
my
palate
there
is
a
lot
that
went
into
this
beer
but
the
sum
is
less
than
the
parts
too
estery
and
phenolic
with
not
enough
pomegranate
or
rye
barrel
probably
could
have
used
more
time
in
the
barrel
andor
more
fruit
additions
i
will
have
trouble
finishing
the
second
glass
because
this
is
just
not
flavorfulenjoyable
for
my
tastes
4
2
very
nice
beer
and
i
drank
it
all
in
about
15
minutes
i
was
celebrating
o
for
14
dollars
i
much
would
have
rather
bought
a
st
bernardus
12
but
its
hard
to
compare
to
that
this
is
a
very
good
beer
from
a
great
brewery
this
isnt
your
typical
quad
and
i
respect
deschutes
for
stepping
out
of
line
with
that
this
warmed
up
quite
a
bit
as
i
drank
the
bottle
and
it
was
as
good
at
room
temperature
as
chilled
o
overall
this
beer
definitely
misses
the
mark
as
a
quad
all
in
all
though
it
is
still
a
pretty
tasty
belgian
beer
has
a
lot
of
the
flavor
components
of
a
bspa
o
a
very
unique
quad
in
terms
of
flavour
mixing
the
addition
of
fruits
and
different
barrel
aging
is
a
nice
touch
a
must
try
pours
a
cloudy
golden
copper
with
a
white
head
that
attenuates
quickly
this
is
not
my
style
but
i
was
pleasantly
surprised
the
bouquet
is
characterized
by
raisin
green
banana
and
fruity
pebbles
flavors
of
sweet
green
banana
and
raisin
that
finishes
with
tart
grape
this
beer
drinks
like
a
belgian
without
that
usual
undesirable
yeast
finish
there
is
a
pleasant
warmth
that
kicks
in
after
a
while
and
thats
very
welcome
indeed
o
by
no
means
is
this
a
traditional
quadrupel
but
it
still
a
tasty
beer
and
worth
a
try
poured
into
a
gulden
draak
tulip
pours
a
medium
orange
amber
with
a
fine
two
finger
white
head
with
great
retention
aromatic
aroma
of
belgian
spices
a
bit
of
light
fruit
and
light
malt
taste
is
light
fruit
a
hint
of
banana
and
cherry
pomegranite
light
bodied
a
suggestion
of
the
wine
barrel
aging
not
very
much
oak
presence
this
seems
less
like
a
quadrupel
and
more
like
a
belgian
strong
pale
ale
nice
looking
and
pleasant
to
drink
but
maybe
not
quite
for
the
premium
series
price
i
am
going
to
age
one
of
these
to
see
how
time
treats
it
i
has
good
potential
o
really
unique
spicy
quad
quite
enjoyable
spicy
and
fruity
other
comments
im
going
to
have
to
stoically
say
meh
o
really
reminds
me
of
a
tripel
or
a
belgian
strong
pale
decent
but
nothing
more
o
a
quad
for
those
with
their
training
wheels
on
light
and
fruity
its
a
strong
offering
from
deschutes
i
actually
think
that
a
more
palate
coating
maltiness
would
really
help
this
beer
immensely
there
are
a
few
too
many
sharp
edges
to
this
beer
right
now
i
am
sure
some
age
will
also
smooth
this
out
a
bit
too
so
if
you
only
have
one
bottle
definitely
hold
on
to
it
for
at
least
a
year
or
two
b
to
a
deschutes
did
a
collaboration
with
my
fav
brewery
boulevard
and
they
are
just
now
moving
into
missouri
welcome
i
am
glad
you
are
here
overall
while
not
a
superior
quad
i
find
it
very
pleasant
to
drink
i
had
no
trouble
with
one
bottle
but
that
would
suffice
for
a
while
as
with
many
deschuttes
products
this
too
is
worth
trying
a
very
easydrinking
quad
considering
the
11
i
wasnt
terribly
impressed
with
this
from
the
bottle
but
on
tap
i
absolutely
loved
it
this
beer
has
a
great
subtle
flavor
with
nothing
overpowering
there
is
a
gentle
warming
that
accents
the
flavor
creating
a
pleasant
drinking
experience
the
mouthfeel
is
quite
well
done
as
well
as
it
is
fullbodied
with
out
the
syrupy
heaviness
this
is
a
good
beer
to
experience
with
others
particularly
wine
lovers
innocuous
and
easy
enough
to
put
away
but
not
very
successful
as
a
quad
o
enjoyable
i
liked
the
red
wine
aftertaste
maybe
the
16
5
percent
aged
in
oak
wine
barrels
made
a
difference
i
would
like
to
age
one
of
these
to
see
how
the
flavors
smooth
out
bottle
poured
into
a
pint
glass
best
by
8412
had
a
really
nice
light
straw
appearance
lots
of
carbonation
i
had
a
bit
of
sediment
in
my
glass
i
didnt
see
to
much
on
the
polls
about
that
so
i
dont
know
if
it
was
this
batch
or
what
smell
is
huge
of
fruit
and
yeast
light
lager
smell
mixed
with
tons
of
fruit
apricot
apples
grapes
taste
tickles
bc
of
the
carbonation
easy
drinker
for
the
huge
abv
much
lighter
than
what
i
thought
it
would
be
much
dif
than
most
of
the
quads
that
ive
had
but
in
general
this
is
not
my
favorite
style
overall
this
is
a
huge
fruit
bomb
with
tons
of
drink
ability
nice
o
overall
this
aint
yo
mammas
quad
i
understand
the
negative
reviews
since
this
is
so
different
and
in
a
way
almost
comes
across
as
a
barrel
wood
chip
aged
fruitvegetable
beer
in
a
blind
taste
test
i
would
guess
that
this
was
from
shorts
no
knock
on
shorts
but
they
tend
to
make
unclassifiable
brews
in
my
opinion
and
they
get
beaten
up
for
it
a
bit
the
flavoring
and
smell
are
quite
complex
and
enjoyable
but
if
you
are
expecting
a
quad
this
is
not
your
beer
i
have
to
admit
that
i
am
a
bit
bummed
that
this
came
from
one
of
my
alltime
favorite
breweries
as
their
first
real
attempt
at
a
quad
i
am
pleased
that
i
have
another
one
of
these
to
open
at
a
later
time
though
since
i
did
find
this
interesting
overall
a
very
good
quadruple
one
of
the
few
in
the
style
that
ive
actually
enjoyed
overall
this
beer
does
not
really
pique
my
interest
i
suppose
i
can
see
what
the
brewers
were
going
for
but
in
my
mind
this
is
not
a
terribly
successful
beer
its
interesting
enough
and
not
bad
to
drink
but
i
feel
like
they
went
the
wrong
way
with
the
funky
flavor
profile
overall
very
smooth
and
very
drinkable
given
the
abv
what
this
beer
doesnt
have
however
is
any
sort
of
wow
factor
for
the
price
id
pick
up
something
else
next
time
22oz
wax
dipped
bottle
served
in
a
tulip
poured
a
slightly
hazy
gold
with
a
finger
of
off
white
head
belgian
yeast
spice
in
the
aroma
along
with
some
fruit
the
pomegranate
and
sugar
medium
bodied
with
plenty
of
carbonation
more
spice
in
the
flavor
some
alcohol
heat
in
the
finish
not
getting
much
barrel
plenty
of
malt
but
not
overly
sweet
big
beer
seemed
like
there
was
more
going
on
in
the
aroma
than
the
flavor
o
a
very
unique
beer
ive
never
been
a
big
quad
guy
but
i
like
this
one
a
little
more
than
usual
more
fruit
flavor
than
just
plum
like
flavor
o
overall
i
really
enjoy
this
beer
unique
characteristics
with
a
refreshing
taste
would
buy
it
again
actually
i
did
i
already
had
it
but
didnt
review
it
so
yes
i
would
buy
iti
again
this
is
a
nice
fruit
beer
quad
fusion
i
would
say
its
more
on
the
fruity
side
than
the
belgian
quad
though
o
not
my
favorite
style
but
seriously
awesome
parts
to
this
beer
deschutes
treats
me
right
yet
again
its
an
interesting
take
on
quad
if
by
definition
of
fermentation
rather
than
adherence
to
dominant
style
and
i
like
it
quite
a
bit
not
my
new
favorite
belgianstyle
but
its
hitting
the
mark
this
evening
o
one
of
the
best
belgian
styles
ive
had
most
of
the
complexity
is
in
the
nose
its
not
so
big
that
people
wouldnt
like
it
though
v12
and
allagash
curieux
seem
much
stronger
at
similar
abv
definitely
try
this
beer
tasty
beer
but
i
was
really
looking
forward
to
more
barrel
aging
character
especially
from
the
wine
barrels
other
than
that
the
beer
is
thinner
in
body
and
color
than
most
other
quads
as
well
as
lacking
the
serious
carbonation
properly
due
for
the
style
o
a
decent
quad
though
a
bit
thick
and
sweet
like
most
american
quads
still
far
from
bad
opinion
i
dont
really
know
what
to
make
of
this
beer
to
be
honest
it
isnt
a
bad
beer
by
any
means
as
it
has
a
lot
of
complexity
in
the
fruit
department
and
the
11abv
is
very
well
hidden
as
it
doesnt
add
heat
or
much
spice
for
that
matter
i
really
like
malty
beers
and
sometimes
the
sweet
ones
are
nice
but
this
one
is
a
bit
much
even
for
me
i
will
gladly
finish
this
bottle
but
i
am
not
sure
that
i
would
be
prepared
to
drink
this
beer
again
since
it
is
so
big
and
well
balanced
perhaps
it
would
be
a
good
one
to
let
age
for
34
years
and
try
it
again
i
imagine
that
it
would
be
quite
different
on
the
palate
by
then
overall
quite
balanced
abv
is
certainly
hidden
the
notes
are
interesting
and
unique
its
just
not
a
quad
overall
not
a
bad
beer
but
definitely
not
like
the
belgian
quads
previously
experienced
overall
not
even
close
to
a
quad
gotta
have
rich
malt
body
spice
from
the
belgian
yeast
and
dark
fruits
to
be
a
quad
this
beer
has
none
of
these
flavors
it
was
okay
but
reminded
be
more
of
a
complex
white
wine
on
tap
at
1702
speedway
pours
a
bright
clean
golden
amber
with
one
finger
of
yellow
nose
is
rich
and
heavy
with
belgian
esters
lots
of
raw
fruit
and
peach
with
spice
and
volatile
alcoholic
heat
some
plum
with
a
light
vinous
character
rich
flavor
with
notes
of
prune
and
overripe
fruit
very
estery
with
a
light
whiskey
character
medium
body
with
a
soft
carbonation
and
warming
finish
overall
a
decent
beer
poured
into
a
chalice
a
very
nice
hazy
golden
yelloworange
color
nice
carbonation
with
a
nice
fizzy
offwhite
head
which
leaves
some
nice
oil
slicks
and
sticky
lacing
the
nose
is
malty
yeasty
with
some
pepperlicorice
notes
slightly
fruity
the
taste
is
slightly
sweet
a
nice
yeast
note
some
pepperlicorice
notes
and
some
fruitiness
medium
body
abv
hidden
very
well
this
is
a
different
kind
of
quad
to
me
more
of
a
belgian
strong
pale
ale
but
still
pretty
tasty
worth
a
try
overall
not
really
a
quad
to
my
palate
it
is
more
like
a
bspa
a
lot
went
into
this
beer
but
the
sum
is
less
than
the
parts
overall
good
beer
i
am
not
the
biggest
belgian
beer
fan
but
this
is
good
i
would
have
to
agree
with
those
that
have
said
it
is
not
a
true
quad
i
tend
to
like
quads
not
enough
dark
fruit
flavors
for
that
3
55
i
think
this
is
one
of
the
better
quads
ive
had
a
nice
alcohol
burn
with
the
great
woody
nose
and
long
spicy
flavors
best
by
date
is
080412
expensive
is
the
only
problem
the
stoic
was
a
rather
pleasant
beer
it
is
not
the
quad
we
are
all
use
to
i
for
one
can
appreciate
the
change
of
pace
enjoyable
beer
easy
to
drink
worth
a
look
o
this
isnt
a
bad
beer
but
is
certainly
not
wowing
i
will
finish
this
beer
but
i
will
not
seek
more
of
this
beer
out
thanks
to
jerz
for
this
overall
this
beer
is
certainly
smooth
drinkable
and
hides
its
strength
well
but
the
flavor
is
a
bit
onedimensional
with
a
large
emphasis
on
the
bubble
gum
m
medium
to
full
body
with
a
hearty
chew
light
to
moderate
carbonation
pours
a
burnt
gold
color
with
a
white
head
of
solidlooking
foam
that
quickly
disperses
into
floating
islands
of
foam
the
nose
is
big
and
complex
with
very
strong
alcohol
and
yeast
that
does
not
quite
overpower
the
subtleties
of
grapes
coriander
lavender
and
pepper
this
beer
is
delicious
maybe
i
should
drink
more
belgians
but
this
one
was
quite
good
simple
and
extremely
flavorful
sweet
and
light
like
a
medium
white
wine
lemon
and
coriander
are
subtle
tones
that
bow
down
before
an
entrance
of
oak
and
earthiness
the
finish
could
have
been
a
little
more
crisp
but
that
is
my
only
main
complaint
o
while
so
many
things
are
mentioned
on
the
label
i
can
taste
just
hints
of
each
pomegrenate
sure
guess
i
can
taste
it
a
bit
oak
rye
barrels
this
i
thought
i
would
taste
for
sure
but
the
flavors
are
so
diminished
they
are
barely
even
there
the
strongest
flavors
that
i
pick
up
from
the
label
were
the
wine
barrel
treatment
for
the
most
part
though
i
get
that
white
grape
concentrate
flavor
that
a
few
other
beers
have
been
using
namely
10
10
10
from
stone
and
the
pinot
lambicus
from
the
bruery
neither
of
which
i
liked
mediocre
beer
for
the
price
o
ill
do
the
overall
assuming
i
wasnt
told
this
was
a
quad
because
they
should
have
never
put
that
on
the
bottle
i
think
this
is
a
belgian
strong
ale
if
you
look
at
it
that
way
its
got
some
spice
some
warmth
from
the
barrel
and
some
sweetness
from
the
wine
and
fruit
could
have
used
some
more
flavor
as
they
seemed
to
throw
alot
into
here
and
didnt
get
the
full
flavor
out
of
any
of
them
really
not
the
best
but
not
the
worst
not
nearly
as
revered
as
the
abyss
but
the
stoic
is
still
something
to
crave
it
warmed
up
beautifully
and
the
pomegranate
flavor
is
more
prominent
than
i
would
have
expected
the
alcohol
is
welldisguised
but
its
mostly
disguised
by
the
sweetness
which
is
a
bit
cloying
if
you
let
it
linger
all
told
i
really
like
this
beer
a
lot
and
would
look
forward
to
getting
another
bottle
hopefully
i
can
dig
one
i
havent
had
too
many
quads
with
pannepot
being
my
favorite
experience
of
this
style
and
although
this
is
unlike
that
brew
i
rather
enjoyed
its
unique
style
and
quirky
characteristics
also
very
big
d
it
was
definitely
a
supper
and
was
pretty
rich
in
flavor
as
well
i
thinks
its
a
great
dessert
beer
final
thought
every
reserve
deschutes
makes
is
worth
a
try
11
and
12
a
pop
get
this
one
and
crack
her
open
o
its
tasty
first
off
not
a
quad
imo
it
has
tastes
of
a
goldena
triple
and
a
saison
i
liked
it
for
that
but
this
is
not
a
quad
overall
good
beer
but
does
not
fit
the
profile
of
a
traditional
quadrupel
i
knew
what
it
was
prior
to
my
review
having
had
it
on
tap
but
people
who
are
expecting
a
traditional
quad
will
be
put
off
by
this
my
scores
are
a
compromise
i
like
this
beer
and
will
pick
it
up
again
but
label
it
as
a
belgian
strong
pale
ale
or
something
more
fitting
and
my
scores
would
be
higher
still
i
like
this
one
i
shared
a
bottle
with
my
cousin
the
pour
was
caramel
in
color
with
a
small
white
head
light
lacing
the
pomegranite
really
comes
through
on
the
aroma
the
pomegranite
and
general
sweet
fruit
notes
are
the
primary
flavors
some
dark
fruit
notes
the
beer
is
full
bodied
average
carbonation
the
alcohol
is
well
hidden
not
a
typical
quad
maybe
more
of
a
high
octane
fruit
beer
i
was
disapointed
that
i
could
not
pick
up
the
other
ba
aspects
of
the
brew
but
everyone
in
the
room
who
tried
the
beer
enjoyed
it
overall
got
to
respect
the
stoic
the
alcohol
is
just
a
bit
too
hot
in
this
young
one
a
year
or
two
of
aging
would
settle
this
one
out
just
right
and
make
it
a
bit
better
another
instance
of
groupthink
i
believe
so
quad
who
gives
a
flying
bird
its
light
tasty
breezy
wellintegrated
soeasy
to
drink
a
beautiful
fall
sipper
i
will
go
get
another
or
two
excellent
beer
full
bodied
with
no
lack
of
carbonation
has
a
very
sweet
aftertaste
a
decent
beer
but
i
dont
plan
to
seek
this
out
again
overallusually
whatever
the
beer
gets
for
the
taste
will
generally
be
for
the
most
part
my
overall
grade
however
its
tastes
very
good
and
i
could
drink
alot
of
this
only
thing
is
its
the
same
beer
style
as
alot
of
heavy
hitters
ive
had
abt12
roch10
exc
yea
i
know
its
not
exactly
a
quad
but
nonetheless
whatever
style
you
want
to
call
it
its
a
tasty
beer
at
14
bucks
a
pop
though
would
i
buy
it
again
maybe
so
but
id
probably
not
interesting
and
certainly
enjoyable
i
think
deschutes
has
done
much
better
but
nothing
wrong
with
this
worth
a
try
overall
not
bad
just
didnt
deserve
to
be
a
limited
release
first
off
for
a
belgian
style
quad
this
looks
nothing
like
what
id
expect
it
to
be
not
that
im
complaining
mind
you
but
its
so
light
not
the
burgundy
amber
id
expect
but
not
the
clear
strawgolden
color
of
say
a
triple
somewhere
inbetween
apparently
aged
in
wine
barrels
and
that
definitely
comes
through
on
the
dry
finish
an
experiment
hybrid
curious
beer
thats
no
where
near
the
monstrosity
i
was
led
to
believe
it
would
be
oam
i
disappointed
a
little
when
compared
to
the
other
deschutes
reserve
beers
this
one
was
unique
i
have
another
bottle
to
age
and
well
see
what
happens
in
a
year
although
im
not
sure
how
much
room
there
is
for
an
increase
o
complex
flavours
in
a
package
with
too
much
of
an
alcohol
taste
o
like
i
said
there
is
too
much
going
on
here
i
appreciate
the
effort
and
ingenuity
put
into
this
beer
but
it
doesnt
quite
come
off
i
wont
pay
12
dollars
for
it
again
but
i
wouldnt
turn
it
down
from
a
friend
o
overall
an
interesting
enjoyable
beer
not
what
i
normall
think
of
in
a
quad
as
it
was
fruiter
and
had
a
lot
of
berries
to
it
but
i
liked
it
would
give
it
another
shot
this
is
a
medium
bodied
brew
with
a
modest
level
of
carbonation
the
overall
feel
of
this
brew
comes
up
a
little
shortthin
very
spicy
with
a
huge
presence
of
belgian
yeast
that
gets
exaggerated
by
a
harshness
of
something
that
smellstastes
like
raw
oak
the
pomegranate
had
enough
to
be
noticed
which
was
an
interesting
change
of
pace
however
for
a
quad
this
one
fell
short
i
think
something
as
simple
as
calling
this
a
belgian
strong
pale
ale
instead
of
a
quad
would
have
increased
my
scores
across
the
board
as
a
quad
this
was
a
bit
of
a
dissapointment
but
asis
it
is
worth
a
try
this
would
have
been
much
better
received
on
my
end
if
the
raw
oak
character
was
replaced
with
more
of
a
used
barrel
presence
overall
a
very
slow
sipping
but
big
flavored
beer
the
flavors
really
grow
as
this
one
warms
very
enjoyable
on
tap
overall
this
really
is
an
excellent
beer
easily
in
my
top
10
mouthfeeloverall
light
bodied
with
quite
a
bit
of
fine
abundant
carbonation
pretty
smooth
going
down
overall
i
didnt
mind
this
beer
so
much
if
deschutes
had
called
it
a
barrel
aged
saison
or
bspa
the
score
would
have
gone
up
exponentially
a
rare
miss
for
this
brewery
overall
pretty
disappointed
when
i
heard
deschutes
a
very
well
respected
brewery
in
my
eyes
was
making
a
barrel
aged
quad
with
pomegrante
i
was
thinking
delicious
but
i
was
disappointed
the
untrained
eye
could
fool
this
for
a
really
strong
basic
saison
i
would
avoid
this
d
love
the
idea
the
label
and
the
name
other
than
that
not
so
good
doesnt
do
the
style
justice
o
really
disappointed
in
this
i
dont
really
understand
where
they
went
wrong
but
it
should
be
back
to
the
drawing
board
for
this
one
not
to
familiar
with
quads
but
it
is
decent
just
not
my
favorite
style
of
beer
overall
its
good
but
i
feel
like
something
is
missing
its
lacing
something
i
cant
quite
put
my
finger
on
i
like
it
but
i
dont
know
why
but
i
dont
really
want
it
o
in
a
display
of
how
disappointing
this
was
i
didnt
even
commit
my
usual
dexterlike
ritual
of
slicing
the
wax
open
and
stealing
it
as
a
souvenir
a
swing
and
a
miss
for
deschutes
poured
clear
and
light
brown
with
an
off
white
2
finger
head
head
into
a
40cl
goblet
good
lacing
throughout
to
the
end
but
poor
head
retention
bottle
indacated
that
it
would
be
good
for
15
months
from
purchase
but
date
so
this
would
have
been
a
good
beer
to
age
aroma
is
very
sweet
with
hints
of
dark
fruit
and
sugar
mouthfeel
was
a
little
thin
for
a
quad
but
very
pleasant
with
just
a
hint
of
hops
and
tons
of
full
belgian
malts
good
balance
between
sweet
and
malt
with
a
dose
of
hops
not
as
full
bodied
as
many
other
quads
but
definitely
worth
the
money
i
will
go
back
and
get
some
to
age
palate
sweet
vinous
fruity
cloying
but
also
slightly
tart
dark
fruit
and
red
wine
clove
bready
malt
becomes
more
tannic
and
dry
in
the
finish
pretty
mediocre
and
not
particularly
drinkable
i
dumped
my
glass
after
a
few
ounces
deschutes
isnt
doing
so
well
with
these
reserve
series
beers
this
year
drink
this
again
was
a
bit
scary
for
me
although
besides
the
small
head
and
lack
of
deep
color
of
normal
quad
colors
and
some
small
aromatics
everthing
worked
well
for
me
big
layered
and
a
tad
sweet
from
the
quad
flavors
overall
its
pretty
good
definitely
not
a
flop
from
deschates
at
all
a
decent
beer
but
doesnt
completely
fit
the
style
the
barrel
aging
is
hardly
noticeable
and
the
price
is
not
warranted
for
this
beer
it
is
enjoyable
but
doesnt
live
up
to
the
hype
not
a
stellar
beer
but
glad
i
tried
could
be
interesting
to
lay
down
for
a
year
or
two
a
decent
take
on
the
style
didnt
blow
me
away
but
enjoyable
all
the
same
overall
i
felt
this
kind
of
missed
the
mark
for
a
quad
and
would
better
be
represent
by
the
tripel
style
the
percentage
that
was
aged
in
bourbon
barrels
did
not
give
off
the
faintest
scent
or
taste
of
bourbon
a
rare
miss
for
deschutes
o
glad
to
try
it
but
im
not
going
to
pop
the
money
for
this
again
might
be
good
with
some
age
o
a
real
miss
from
deschutes
a
rare
one
as
well
very
disappointing
o
theres
almost
too
much
going
on
in
this
beer
nothing
wrong
may
be
interesting
to
cellar
for
a
bit
and
see
what
happens
overall
a
solid
beer
but
4
ounces
was
sufficient
pours
a
clear
golden
color
with
a
1
inch
puffy
white
head
that
settles
to
a
thin
cap
thin
broken
rings
of
lace
line
the
glass
on
the
drink
down
smell
is
of
dark
fruits
banana
caramel
and
malt
taste
is
of
dark
fruits
and
banana
malt
some
caramel
yeast
alcohol
and
a
tart
flavor
i
am
not
really
getting
any
pomegranate
or
barrel
aged
flavors
in
the
smell
or
taste
this
beer
has
a
higher
level
of
carbonation
with
a
crisp
and
prickly
mouthfeel
there
is
an
alcohol
burn
in
the
back
of
the
throat
with
each
sip
overall
this
is
a
good
beer
from
deschutes
but
not
as
good
as
i
was
expecting
based
on
their
other
barrel
aged
offerings
overall
this
beer
was
a
nice
belgium
style
quad
with
true
wild
yeast
characters
d
fantastic
deschutes
does
it
again
this
brewery
always
delivers
its
hard
to
drink
too
much
of
it
but
it
is
great
12
oz
bottles
of
this
would
be
amazing
overall
this
was
really
good
not
at
all
anything
like
what
i
would
normally
think
of
as
a
quad
but
really
really
solid
a
unique
beer
from
deschutes
this
is
the
first
belgianstyle
ive
had
from
them
and
i
like
their
approach
to
blending
in
the
nopoints
category
beautiful
label
not
a
completely
successful
beer
has
some
really
good
things
going
on
but
failed
to
excite
me
overall
maybe
deschutes
should
take
some
pointers
from
their
buddies
at
boulevard
on
how
to
barrelage
belgian
styles
d
despite
the
abv
would
not
tire
quickly
mouthfeel
is
a
little
heavy
but
not
sticky
or
oppressive
overall
nice
beer
not
a
chugger
its
a
sipper
dont
know
what
to
call
this
beast
except
tasty
it
will
be
interesting
to
update
this
one
after
a
year
or
so
in
the
cellar
note
deschutes
should
not
have
put
a
best
by
date
on
the
beer
that
is
one
year
out
really
limits
multiple
bottle
purchases
and
makes
it
seem
as
if
the
beer
has
no
chance
at
developing
further
with
age
kinda
perturbed
about
the
taste
doesnt
really
taste
or
feel
like
a
quad
in
my
mouth
more
like
a
tripel
adequate
taste
just
not
what
i
would
expect
from
a
quad
maybe
the
waxcoated
cap
got
my
hopes
up
too
high
im
not
quite
sure
why
this
is
billed
as
a
quad
certainly
that
style
isnt
particularly
welldefined
at
least
not
historically
but
this
seems
more
like
a
tripel
in
all
respects
the
sweetness
though
absolutely
dominates
the
flavor
over
the
yeast
and
other
elements
lets
just
say
that
im
glad
the
price
tag
fell
off
this
one
so
thats
one
thing
i
dont
remember
pours
an
orangepeach
color
with
minimal
head
soft
pour
also
the
aroma
is
crazy
spice
bitter
berry
yeast
and
some
sweet
fruit
at
the
end
it
is
a
bit
stronger
than
i
expected
but
was
very
good
there
seems
to
be
2
sides
to
this
one
the
first
sip
was
a
bit
spicy
as
far
as
it
started
with
very
little
sweetness
and
the
quad
style
really
came
thru
with
that
strong
belgian
yeast
then
a
quick
second
sip
became
oh
so
sweet
it
was
like
the
smoothest
blended
fruit
juice
then
some
light
wood
characteristics
then
a
creamy
bubblegum
finish
the
carbonation
level
is
about
perfect
on
this
one
just
enough
to
wake
it
up
some
each
sip
but
not
to
where
it
over
powers
it
there
is
just
a
very
small
hint
at
the
11
but
overall
this
is
very
drinkable
a
bit
sweet
on
the
finish
for
me
but
glad
i
go
to
try
this
one
pours
an
orangish
golden
amber
color
with
a
large
cream
colored
head
that
hangs
around
for
a
long
time
scent
is
a
bit
on
the
funky
side
wasnt
expecting
that
i
get
a
lot
of
white
grape
aroma
with
typical
belgian
beer
spices
and
belgian
yeast
very
fruity
and
spicy
with
nice
funk
flavor
is
initially
spicy
with
hints
of
barnyard
funk
then
you
get
a
ton
of
white
grape
flavor
with
belgian
yeast
then
the
rye
and
oak
kick
in
with
definite
vanilla
and
butterscotch
flavors
from
the
barrel
quite
a
bit
of
booziness
and
burn
in
the
finish
mouthfeel
is
medium
bodied
with
a
bit
of
a
creamy
feel
drinkability
is
fairly
high
overall
i
think
this
is
a
very
nice
and
tasty
beer
i
was
very
skeptical
due
to
the
high
amount
of
poor
reviews
and
trash
talk
on
this
beer
i
will
admit
that
this
should
in
no
way
shape
or
form
be
labeled
as
a
quad
not
sure
what
i
would
call
it
but
i
really
enjoy
it
im
glad
i
read
reviews
of
this
beer
before
cracking
it
its
definitely
a
bsga
and
not
a
quad
in
fact
its
quite
a
good
bsga
great
apple
and
spice
notes
very
drinkable
and
complex
most
everything
you
could
want
from
a
bsga
in
fact
definitely
comparable
to
la
fin
du
monde
if
not
better
however
since
the
beer
notes
a
presence
of
pomegranate
wine
barrels
and
rye
barrels
youd
think
those
elements
would
have
a
larger
presence
i
kept
wishing
there
would
be
more
of
a
note
from
any
of
those
some
large
sips
gave
off
a
vanilla
hint
that
brought
forth
the
rye
the
final
sips
of
the
bottle
gave
me
some
interesting
pomegranate
notes
however
it
just
never
came
together
this
beer
was
too
subtle
for
my
tastes
and
i
wish
i
would
have
beaten
me
over
the
head
a
bit
more
with
each
of
the
added
elements
then
it
could
have
been
a
great
beer
instead
of
a
merely
very
good
beer
that
disappointment
makes
me
give
it
a
lower
score
than
it
probably
deserves
o
quad
maybe
not
but
what
do
i
know
i
liked
this
beer
it
has
a
great
flavor
and
i
am
definitely
going
to
buy
another
bottle
to
cellar
screw
semantics
i
enjoyed
this
whole
bottle
i
think
i
like
this
one
very
much
at
12bottle
not
one
id
buy
all
the
time
but
for
a
special
evening
just
the
thing
overall
very
drinkable
with
no
complaints
here
not
the
best
quad
but
not
the
worst
the
beer
pours
a
dark
brown
color
with
a
tannish
head
the
aroma
is
full
of
nuts
and
toffee
i
seem
to
remember
the
hazelnut
brown
nectar
from
rogue
tasting
similar
to
this
beer
but
it
has
been
a
long
time
since
i
have
had
it
the
flavor
is
full
of
caramel
and
toffee
malt
with
some
cocoa
and
nuttyness
there
is
a
cream
flavor
to
the
beer
as
well
medium
to
thick
mouthfeel
and
medium
carbonation
nice
but
not
worth
the
price
really
good
beer
great
dessert
beer
after
a
good
meal
or
with
a
good
cigar
lots
of
layers
and
very
well
balanced
well
like
many
of
the
other
reviewers
i
wouldnt
call
this
a
quad
and
tastes
great
hard
to
knock
it
plus
the
addition
of
pomegranate

as
far
as
beer
goes
this
is
really
good
not
so
much
a
quad
but
a
really
interesting
experimental
brew
that
deserves
more
credit
depechemode1983sep
16
and
is
more
like
a
tripel
for
me
honestly
the
yeast
gives
that
chemical
it
still
tastes
fantastic
i
would
classify
it
more
as
a
belgian
strong
pale
its
a
bit
of
a
mess
way
too
cloying
and
alcoholic
ill
take
a
st
bernardus
anytime
over
this
beaver13sep
11
but
it
probably
has
to
do
with
my
love
of
pomegranates
i
wouldnt
really
recommend
this
spice
and
quadrupel
offerings
that
were
not
in
their
reserve
line
which
expressed
a
truer
belgian
heart
than
this
beer
i
think
it
has
potential
but
probably
not
something
i
would
seek
out
or
want
to
have
on
too
many
occasions

like

up
a

bottles
for
down
the
line
who
knows
maybe
like
the
actual
drinking
of
the
beer
this
quad
from
landtsheer
was
decent
at
12abv
was
very
smooth
and
easy
to
drink
the
beer
poured
a
rich
amber
maybe
dark
amber
was
tough
to
tell
with
the
darker
room
i
was
in
there
was
a
sudsy
head
that
dissipated
and
did
not
leave
a
lace
the
scent
was
typical
of
most
quads
not
overpowering
the
taste
was
slightly
tart
with
good
belgian
sugar
to
balance
it
out
the
mouthfeel
was
medium
in
body
with
smooth
carbonation
overall
it
was
decent
and
i
am
not
a
quad
guy

and

medium
carbonation
smooth
taste
and
finish
alcohol
taste
is
hidden
and
is
a
very
drinkable
quad
not
bitter
at
all
with
a
good
flavor
not
a
bad
beer
per
se
but
comes
across
rather
weak
watery
and
generally
chaotic
as
far
as
depth
and
balance
go
the
initial
pour
produced
mostly
all
foam
despite
using
a
proper
pour
technique
although
it
eventually
settled
into
decent
balance
of
body
with
head
the
smell
was
really
lowkey
although
it
had
a
nice
variety
of
scents
the
flavor
and
mouthfeel
both
seemed
rather
weak
allaround
especially
with
the
overly
fizzy
carbonation
feel
subsequent
sips
reminded
me
more
of
a
bitter
cola
than
a
deep
balanced
and
complex
beer
fair
but
certainly
meet
my
expectations
for
a
quad
3
485
not
really
a
rochefort
10
killer
but
enjoyable
enough
for
me
to
kill
the
entire
750
with
no
trouble
ruby
with
tinges
of
brown
with
a
persistent
finger
of
bubbly
foam
the
smell
is
fragrant
with
licorice
and
molasses
present
and
some
dark
fruits
the
taste
is
rich
and
sweet
dark
fruits
with
a
bit
of
alcohol
in
the
back
all
in
all
a
nice
quad
thanks
to
byronic
for
bringing
this
back
from
belgium
for
me
bottled
in
2008
murky
dark
rusty
brown
pour
with
a
huge
three
finger
head
with
decent
retention
and
lacing
sweet
malty
boozey
nose
with
lots
of
brown
bread
and
dark
fruit
along
with
hints
of
toffee
nuts
and
subtle
chocolate
the
taste
follows
suit
with
rich
dark
fruit
and
sweet
caramel
malt
along
with
hints
of
prunes
licorice
brown
bread
tea
leather
subtle
chocolate
and
booze
the
mouthfeel
is
medium
bodied
and
slightly
syrupy
with
a
surprising
amount
of
fizzy
carbonation
still
present
for
such
an
old
beer
the
boozey
finish
i
remembered
from
fresher
bottles
has
become
much
smoother
with
age
overall
this
has
held
up
nicely
in
the
cellar
with
only
a
slight
criticism
of
a
bit
too
much
sweetness
excellent
beer
good
sipper
for
a
cold
day
such
as
today
i
havent
had
this
in
over
a
year
in
my
opinion
it
is
underrated
you
got
to
drink
it
quite
close
to
expiration
date
poured
a
super
dark
chestnut
pretty
dark
for
a
quad
a
bit
cloudy
as
well
light
doesnt
travel
well
through
this
not
a
bad
thing
necessarily
but
interesting
to
note
rum
soaked
raisins
hint
of
toffee
caramel
lots
of
belgian
candi
sugar
i
get
a
touch
of
roasted
grains
in
the
finish
too
perhaps
a
touch
of
roasted
barley
or
chocolate
malt
in
here
pretty
nice
quad
doesnt
really
compare
with
the
big
guys
like
rochefort
10
or
chimay
blue
but
will
do
in
a
pinch
pretty
good
seriously
boozy
but
a
pleasant
sipper
looks
ok
while
the
aroma
and
flavour
are
very
sweet
and
fruity
plenty
of
dried
fruit
sugar
and
yeast
in
evidence
body
is
alright
but
could
be
a
tad
more
unctuous
for
the
strength
goes
down
nicely
enough
a
tasty
brew
to
finish
with
worth
sampling
if
you
have
the
chance
overall
this
is
a
fine
quad
it
has
that
belgian
flavor
youd
expect
with
the
fruits
the
phenols
the
yeast
esters
and
ties
it
all
together
rather
than
leaving
it
a
muddled
mess
it
isnt
shy
at
all
about
announcing
its
abv
but
why
should
it
be
not
every
beer
has
to
disguise
its
strength
im
impressed
with
this
and
would
definitely
drink
it
again
fantastic
quad
ondraft
odecent
quad
but
a
little
too
sweet
for
me
overall
this
quad
is
a
little
different
and
a
lot
underrated
wonderful
big
beer
pours
a
clear
copper
with
a
foamy
khaki
head
that
settles
to
a
film
on
top
of
the
beer
small
dots
of
lace
form
around
the
glass
on
the
drink
down
smell
is
of
malt
dark
fruit
brown
sugar
toffee
and
alcohol
aromas
taste
is
much
the
same
with
dark
fruit
and
toffee
flavors
on
the
finish
there
is
a
mild
amount
of
spice
bitterness
on
the
palate
with
each
sip
this
beer
has
a
lower
level
of
carbonation
with
a
slightly
crisp
and
medium
bodied
mouthfeel
overall
this
is
a
good
beer
that
is
tasty
but
fairly
boozy
and
strong
at
12
alcohol
this
is
definitely
a
sipping
beer
and
a
good
one
at
that
rjt
o
overall
a
solid
quad
330
ml
bottle
pours
an
opaque
brown
almost
black
colour
with
a
head
that
fades
quickly
leaving
a
strong
lace
smells
of
dried
fruits
figs
raisins
chocolate
spicy
and
fruity
sticky
sweet
palate
not
much
carbonation
and
no
needed
taste
of
dried
fruits
pepper
spices
chocolate
it
warms
your
throat
like
brandy
and
leaves
you
asking
for
more
even
with
its
12º
great
pairs
very
well
with
orange
chicken
for
some
reason
there
is
so
much
flavor
playing
in
perfect
harmony
deep
fruits
almost
like
dried
plums
and
raisins
blend
with
a
bright
carbonated
mouthfeel
that
ignites
the
booziness
that
is
incredibly
hidden
for
12
im
not
veteran
enough
to
understand
the
flavors
at
play
but
understand
that
it
is
supremely
delicious
and
the
best
quad
ive
had
age
these
with
care
and
youll
have
a
beer
worthy
of
high
regard
overall
this
beer
is
a
beast
strong
complex
flavorful
and
well
balanced
o
not
a
bad
quad
it
has
a
nicely
complex
aroma
and
a
decent
flavor
it
just
doesnt
stand
up
with
some
the
heavy
hitters
of
the
style
it
has
an
interesting
flavor
i
pick
up
some
more
malty
sweetness
caramel
fig
and
date
puree
and
a
light
rum
note
still
retains
its
carbonation
definitely
a
sipper
this
one
is
a
keeper
for
sure
people
told
me
about
rochefort
10
or
st
bernardus
abt
12
which
seem
to
be
very
popular
and
highly
rated
and
arent
bad
but
this
beer
beats
those
by
a
mile
its
full
of
big
flavors
and
aromas
with
many
layers
and
a
much
original
flavor
signature
and
balance
to
me
yet
to
have
a
quad
that
blows
my
mind
this
one
was
no
exception
regardless
i
consider
this
a
great
beer
and
enjoyed
the
whole
bottle
from
start
to
finish
for
the
price
and
given
the
availability
the
likelihood
of
purchasing
this
beer
again
for
me
is
high
o
good
aroma
excellent
sweet
belgian
delciousness
for
flavor
good
full
mouthfeel
its
not
the
epitome
of
the
worlds
best
quads
but
this
is
some
really
good
beer
on
tap
at
dog
street
pub
in
williamsburg
perhaps
it
was
that
drinking
this
was
an
alternative
to
shopping
with
my
girlfriend
but
most
likely
it
was
the
quality
that
gives
this
such
a
good
review
such
a
classic
quad
well
balanced
rich
and
complex
barely
a
hint
of
its
strong
abv
and
absolutely
delicious
going
down
i
think
ill
have
to
buy
one
of
dogs
awesome
growlers
and
fill
it
with
this
worth
the
trip
oa
really
nice
beer
fermented
out
this
beer
finishes
dry
with
a
nice
estery
belgian
yeast
character
and
sweet
toasted
malt
flavor
the
strength
is
well
hidden
lacks
the
complexity
in
taste
of
a
st
bernardus
or
westy
quad
but
still
an
excellent
beer
easy
to
drink
covers
the

very

quite

to

on
no
idea
on
the
age
of

but
i
would
have
to
say
it
probably
is
fairly
old
and
it
definitely
holds
up
well
this
is
a
very
enjoyable
sipper
d
awesome
huge
beer
not

but
would
have
again
o
overall
a
good
beer
but
might
get
a

better
with
age
this
is
essentially
what
you
expect
from
a
quad
raisins
brown
sugar
toffee
a
little
bit
of
chocolate
lots
of
flavor
in
this
and
all
in
a
good
way
a

in
the
beer
with
nice
fine
bubbles
overall
a
very
enjoyable
drink
particularly
when
paired
with
a
good
meal
overall
this
is
a
big
beer
lots
of
malt
dark

and
alcohol
in
this
beer
pretty
good
taste
is
full
and
quite
alcoholic
the
beer
is

has
strong

character
it
reminds
of
dark
fruit
candi

the
beer
has

alcohol
which
is
nicely

its

the
beer

the

not

to
fascinate

original
review
on
09032010
o
i
found
this
beer
enjoyable
while
the
alcohol
is
apparent
in
the
nose
i
did
not
find
it
overwhelming
in
the
flavor
the
finish
was
the
highlight
of
this
beer
for
me
because
it
leaves
your
palate
with
only
a
lingering
flavor
this
made
me
want
more
on
tap
at
sessions
in
greensboro
poured
into
a
tulip
glass
a
deep
amber
color
with
a
fluffy
tightly
formed
one
finger
off
white
head
that
lasted
for
quite
awhile
raisin
and
plum
notes
in
the
nose
along
with
lighter
yeasty
spice
and
brown
sugar
dark
fruit
dominates
the
palate
with
some
medicinal
notesthe
alcohol
is
heavy
and
pretty
sweet
its
a
nice
sipper
but
the
yeast
and
alcohol
can
be
a
bit
much
for
me
o
not
easily
drinkable
also
a
good
beer

totally

for

my
score
will
probably
be
seen
as
a
bit
harsh
but
for
me
this
just
lacks
charisma
and
emotional
intensity
d
its
an
wonderful
after
dinner
or
late
evening
sipper
overall
a
very
solid
quad
just
not
quite
as
good
as
the
top
class
like
st
bernardus
12
or
rochefort
10
not
as
smooth
and
easy
drinkin
as
those
o
a
good
beer
that
id
like
to
try
again
some
place
else
at
this
juncture
i
cant
recommend
it
smell
is
somewhat
caramellic
sweetness
taset
is
good
a
very
drinkable
quad
but
the
alcohol
is
not
really
hidden
o
ive
had
superior
quads
to
this
the
ample
sweetness
and
lack
of
notable
flavors
were
negatives
for
me
i
dont
think
this
is
undrinkable
by
any
means
i
just
think
there
are
better
options
seek
out
if
you
are
a
big
fan
of
quads
almost
a
little
too
syrupy
but
the
taste
work
well
mmmmm
dangerous
beer
poured
right
out
of
the
fridge
so
too
cold
but
with
a
smallish
tan
head
that
slowly
settles
and
no
lace
color
is
a
cloudy
amber
brown
aroma
is
lots
of
dark
ripe
fruits
candies
malt
toffee
caramel
fruit
loam
flavors
a
lot
like
nose
but
with
big
sweetness
tempered
by
good
carbonic
tang
very
well
balanced
as
they
say
very
little
alcohol
in
the
finish
which
is
like
flavor
and
of
average
length
great
easy
drinking
powerful
brew
this
pours
a
nice
dark
slightly
hazy
brown
to
dark
red
color
with
a
large
size
off
white
head
which
quickly
dissipates
the
smells
are
of
grapes
and
dark
fruit
with
a
little
alcohol
the
feel
is
medium
with
lots
of
carbonation
the
taste
is
pretty
sweet
the
dark
fruit
some
brown
sugar
and
the
alcohol
burn
on
the
way
down
but
still
well
masked
for
12
one
i
would
definitely
recommend
m
thick
and
smooth
the
way
a
beer
that
tastes
like
this
should
feel
overall
good
beer
i
liked
it
but
thought
it
lacked
the
complexity
of
my
favorite
quad
trappiste
rochefort
10
priced
very
well
i
would
purchase
this
one
again
ws
o
this
is
a
absolutely
a
good
beer
like
i
said
strong
and
tasteful
a
delight
for
after
dinner
o
this
is
a
fantastic
beer
and
is
quite
reasonably
priced
in
my
area
and
in
chicago
as
well
where
i
first
found
a
750
ml
bottle
for
roughly
10
as
far
as
quadrupels
go
i
believe
this
is
one
of
the
best
overall
i
think
ill
pass
on
this
one
next
time
it
was
just
too
thick
for
me
causing
a
sticky
sweet
residue
in
the
mouth
overall
a
really
nice
quadrupel
a
little
on
the
sweet
end
for
my
taste
though
dr
fair
price
pretty
drinkable
and
low
quality
for
the
style
nice
aroma
with
a
bit
of
caramel
and
sour
dough
the
taste
is
a
little
on
the
alcoholy
side
with
a
sharp
aftertaste
not
the
best
in
the
world
but
a
solid
above
average
quad
bubbly
in
the
mouth
which
lingers
for
quite
a
bit
overall
a
nice
beer
picked
this
one
up
as
part
of
a
mixed
six
pack
at
liquormart
in
boulder
poured
a
hazy
dark
brown
color
with
a
creamy
brown
head
aromas
of
yeast
spice
and
chocolate
on
the
palate
this
one
was
medium
bodied
with
flavors
of
dark
raisins
spice
yeast
and
booze
loosely
translated
from
their
website
the
description
says
take
quiet
time
for
you
the
nice
round
and
full
taste
will
easily
drinkable
assuming
the
broken
grammar
is
due
to
structural
discrepancies
and
that
line
wasnt
actually
written
by
a
southeast
asian
immigrant
its
more
or
less
the
case
if
you
want
something
strong
that
goes
down
pretty
easy
this
is
a
good
choice
i
just
dont
recommend
it
after
youve
already
had
nine
so
if
its
like
the
first
bottle
i
had
a
otherwise
f
i
rated
the
first
bottle
clearly
does
a
good
job

the
bottom
of
the

felt
a

overpowered
by
the
alcohol
the
mouthfeel
was
full
with
a
constantly
blooming
carbonation
o
merely
an
average
quad
decent
but
the
metallic
aftertaste
and
weak
mouthfeel
were
subpar
o
not
what
i
expected
here
but
this

was
tasty
this

this

d
nice

really
sweet
most
definitely
a
sipper
though
good
feel
sweet
and
strong
but
complex
and
inviting
and
with
a
well
placed
level
of
carbonation
a
very
good
quad
that
has
no
flaws
in
my
view
lacking
a
bit
in
complexity
only
when
compared
with
the
best
in
the
game
rich
flavor
as
the
dark
fruit
contingent
carries
through
from
the
aroma
to
lace
the
palate
with
browned
apple
flesh
plum
and
currants
the
alcohol
makes
itself
felt
on
the
back
of
the
palate
with
a
hint
of
boozy
sweetness
heat
but
at
no
point
is
it
overbearing
mouthfeel
is
creamy
and
a
bit
thinner
than
i
would
have
expected
for
the
style

i
assume
the
uppity
carbonation
level
probably
has
something
to
do
with
that

proved
to
be
a
tasty
belgian
quad
that
hit
the
spot
on
a
chilly
austin
night
a
worthy
candidate
for
the
cellar
had
a
bottle
at
bxl
on
43rd
in
midtown
for
11
served
in
a
stemmed
malheur
glass
it
appeared
a
hazy
red
with
a
short
tan
head
while
this
beer
was
a
bit
of
a
sipper
i
was
impressed
by
how
smooth
it
was
for
the
strength
and
that
it
was
relatively
drinkable
compared
to
other
12
beers
the
flavor
was
dominated
by
sweet
vanilla
and
plum
with
berry
fruits
and
typical
subtle
belgian
spicing
in
the
background
the
hops
were
there
mostly
for
balance
and
contributed
little
to
the
taste
heck
of
a
quad
one
of
the
best
ive
had
d
surprisingly
easy
to
drink
and
very
little
booze
apparent
on
the
palate
for
the
price
i
think
itd
be
tough
to
find
a
better
quad
notes
nice
quad
not
a
flaw
other
than
somehow
it
feels
a
notch
or
two
behind
grandeur
and
some
of
the
biggies
for
the
style
either
the
classics
or
some
experimental
ones
still
quite
a
remarkable
and
recommendable
brew
d
the
beer
is
actually
quite
drinkable
considering
its
strength
because
most
of
the
alcohol
is
masked
from
the
taste
its
definitely
one
that
needs
to
be
sipped
given
the
high
alcohol
content
the
nose
presents
dark
fruit
overlaid
by
a
faint
graphite
quality
the
dark
fruits
open
up
on
the
palate
with
the
wellhidden
alcohol
incorporating
into
a
mildly
dry
but
flavorpacked
whole
mouthfeel
is
delicately
fuzzy
but
perhaps
a
bit
on
the
flatter
side

drinkability
this
is
a
nice
quad
no
hint
of
booze
despite
the
relatively
high
abv
one
that
i
will
revisit
d
the
booze
element
needs
work
or
somoothing
out
it
seems
like
there
would
be
more
potential
in
this
beer
after
some
aging
but
this
bottle
wasnt
great
that
said
i
wouldnt
mind
sitting
down
to
really
work
at
this
one
given
the
reviews
ive
read
this
is
a
wonderful
rich
and
complex
belgian
quad
the
best
ive
had
in
a
long
time
i
would
easily
buy
this
again
for
a
special
occasion
i
have
to
say
that
after
having
recently
drank
st
bernardus
rochefort
the
reverand
urthel
samaranth
and
rigor
mortis
this
one
is
clearly
my
favorite
the
mouthfeel
character
cleanliness
complexity
and
nuance
make
this
a
winner
highly
recommended
d
maybe
this
should
be
aged
for
5
years
before
drinking
it
is
super
smooth
and
there
is
really
no
immediate
hint
of
the
abv
other
than
the
taste
of
lingering
sugar
the
carbonation
really
killed
this
beer
for
me
once
it
settles
down
it
was
fine
it
just
really
lacked
the
complexity
i
am
looking
for
in
the
style
the
beer
gains
flavor
and
mouthfeel
as
it
warms
dont
drink
it
too
cold
the
smell
is
predominantly
figs
raisins
and
sour
cherries
it
has
a
faint
vinous
overtone
the
taste
is
a
mild
and
malty
toasted
brown
sugar
i
had
a
westvleteren
a
year
ago
and
if
my
memory
serves
me
correctly
this
beer
is
not
as
sweet
and
fruity
the
mouthfeel
is
a
pleasant
lubrication
that
cries
out
for
a
medium
bodied
dry
cheese
like
a
pecorino
or
parmesan
share
this
beer
otherwise
it
may
be
one
and
done
a
little
rough
around
the
edges
yet
still
very
controlled
for
a
quada
treat
to
drink
the
road
most
taken
would
be
blueveined
cheese
with
some
fig
spread
a
bit
more
daring
would
be
a
pork
loin
with
mole
sauce
d
truly
enjoyed
this
one
an
excellent
quad
beware
packs
a
punch
with

abv
notes
i
think
its
impossible
to
make
a
bad
quadbsd
this
one
is
pretty
textbook
a
lingering
flavor
of
sweet
cherries
makes
it
quite
plesant
i
should
have
bought
another
for
cellering
d
it
is
fairly
easy
drinker
for
the
12abv
which
is
too
well
hidden
i

albiet
a

by
myself
this
is

of
my
favorite
fall

beers
but
it

is
a
one

done
drinkability
i
would
have
this
beer
again
although
i
would
limit
this
to
one
per
night
its
a
heavy
hitting
beer
but
a
very
tasty
one
d
definitely
something
to
sip
slowly
i
should
definitely
be
splitting
this
bottle
with
a
friend
but
im
not
so
im
sure
ill
be
falling
out

my
chair
pretty
soon

picked
it
up
on

very

of

always
be
found
in

though
not
in
the
top
echelon
with
respect

this
is
certainly
a
fine
and
wellbalanced
quad
jd
at
the
end
of
the
day
a
very
nice
while
not
quite
a
masterful
quad
i
will
definitely
have
it
again

possibly
as

great
after
dinner
beer
with
its
light
sweetness
and
great
mouthfeel
you
do
start
to
feel
the
high
abv
after
a
few
sips
though
drinkability
if
fantastic
this
is
one
of
my
favorite
quads
no
one
of
my
favorite
beers
i
like
it
even
better
with
a
few
years
of
cellaring
it
becomes
an
amazing
beer
buy
two
drink
one
save
one
for
a
few
years
better
yet
buy
a
case
and
try
one
every
4
to
6
months
seek
out
this
beer
carbonation
is
suitably
high
alcoholic
heat
is
quite
noticeable
note
drink
like

with
the
addition
of
dark
fruits
like
fig

and
plum
mild
carbonation
and
mediumbodied
this
is
an
ok
beer
but
it
doesnt
particularly
impress
me
in
the
flavor
department
seems
to
be
missing
a
bit
of
the
spices
in
the
taste
delicious
and
sweetspicy
this
beer
is
a
delight
for
all
belgian
beer
fans
particularly
those
of
chimay
blue
but
with
a
sweetness
that
trends
toward
kasteel
bruin
d
exceptionally
easy
to
drink
for
a
12
but
not
quite
as
good
in
this
department
as
its
nitro
brother
overall
this
is
an
excellent
and
unique
quad
now
in
heavy
rotation
among
my
regulars
washes
down
pretty
well
and
not
overly
carbonated
a
bit
heavy
to
be
drinking
much
of
it
then
again
this
was
towards
the
end
of
the
night
and
i
was
a
little
saturated
a
tasty
quad
with
plenty
going
on
an
interesting
yeast
profile
supports
the
malt
d
i
would
expect
a
quad
to
have
more
complexity
it
reminds
me
of
the
trois
pistols
if
that
is
the
case
then
this
is
a
very
solid
brew
this
is
a
little
less
yeasty
than
the
bottle
version
but
the
strength
is
still
very
present
a
good
beer
bur
for
later
at
night
d
really
enjoyable
beer
all
around
nice
robust
brew
and
will
only
have
one
due
to
the
alcohol
presence
overall
i
thought
this
was
a
solid
beer
but
it
was
more
of
a
bsda
than
a
quad
it
just
didnt
have
the
thickness
and
heavier
malt
profile
of
the
latter
still
a
decent
beer
thats
worth
a
shot
the
pour
is
a
dark
brown
color
with
a
very
small
off
white
head
the
flavor
is
amazingly
complex
starts
off
with
sweet
molasses
flavors
and
goes
all
over
the
place
chocolate
dark
fruit
sweet
flavors
everywhere
finished
with
a
nice
floral
hop
finish
and
just
the
right
amount
of
bitterness
fairly
thin
for
its
complexity
and
alc
content
goes
down
amazingly
easy
for
12
percent
loved
it
will
be
seeking
it
in
the
near
future
d
i
wouldnt
call
this
a
by
the
numbers
quadrupel
its
certainly
well
made
and
a
nice
complexity
as
i
expect
just
missing
something
to
make
me
go
crazy
the
flavours
are
quite
good
pours
a

with
a
nice
finebubbled
light

aroma
is
malty
and
has
an
overtone
of
hard
cider
malty
flavor
has
a
strong
fruity
and
brandylike
tone
as
well
as
a
hint
of
chocolate
and
just
a
whisper
of
sweetness
texture
is
smooth
and
quite
fizzy
d
a
tasty
quad
w
lots
of
complexity
which
i
am
glad
i
tasted
as
it
opens
up
slightly
warmer
i
also
was
happy
to
taste
in
a
more
relaxed
setting
than
previous
since
it
has
subtlety
to
pick
up
it
doesnt
taste
anything
like
12
it
displayed
most
of
the
flavor
near
cellar
temp
i
prefer
something
like
this
as
a
nightcap
beer
d
a
bit
cloying
and
big
abv
though
disguised
well
hurt
drinkability
ill
keep
the
other
4
around
for
an
ocassion
f
still
very
sweet
lingering
but
it
gets
a
slight
dryness
some
creamy
taste
lingering
not
really
boozy
anymore
more
lingering
raisin
and
a
touch
of
smoke
despite
having
a
boozy
taste
and
warmth
there
was
no
alcohol
burn
or
real
feel
otherwise
and
way
too
sweet
an
excellent
well
crafted
belgian
quad
overall
not
the
best
quad
ive
had
but
very
unique
and
enjoyable
cheers
ideas
from
fellow
tasters
not
a
session
beer
but
good
with
friends
all
in
all
its
a
good
brew
but
a
bit
overloaded
on
the
sweetness
pours
a
brownish
body
with
good
head
and
a
lace
ring
on
top
of
a
yeasty
spicy
dark
fruit
and
orangeish
smell
caramel
and
other
sugary
sweetness
emerge
very
smooth
and
creamy
i
never
wouldve
guess
that
this
is
classified
as
a
quad
a
little
chewey
for
a
mediumbodied
beer
there
are
a
plethora
of
dark
fruit
flavors
like
cherrt
and
orange
surrounded
by
sugary
sweet
malts
like
caramel
and
hints
of
toffee
a
little
sticky
its
so
sweet
but
finishes
sweet
and
a
little
dry
like
a
biscuit
for
some
reason
abv
is
wellhidden
and
this
is
just
a
great
quad
drinkability
a
very
complex
and
well
balanced
brew
a
tad
expensive
but
worth
it
once
in
a
while
d
this
beer
drinks
much
lighter
than
its
high
abv
should
allow
i
was
finished
with
my
glass
in
what
felt
like
minutes
it
was
a
subzero
night
when
i
drank
this
and
it
was
a
perfect
way
to
keep
warm
in
the
cold
foam
spicy
or
salty
nose
slightly
chocolaty
and
fruity
with
aromas
of
sweet
wine
more
marked
the
taste
of
alcohol
and
toasted
malt
are
certainly
present
but
they
are
not
powerful
by
cons
it
is
much
more
pungent
than
the
others
style
quad
it
also
feels
slightly
fruity
rum
the
end
of
mouth
is
dry
bitter
and
most
persistent
feature
of
beers
malheur
this
is
a
nice
quad
but
not
much
more
tasty
and
satisfying
but
not
nearly
the
most
impressive
quad
on
the
market
complex
and
loving
it
really
good
stuff
here
d
we
both
loved
this
i
think
this
deserves
more
attention
this
was
never
on
my
radar
in
the
states
you
can
be
sure
ill
pick
up
more
to
enjoy
this
is
fairly
well
made
but
not
on
the
same
level
as
my
favorites
i
will
however
certainly
buy
it
again
anytime
i
want
a
decent
priced
well
made
bsda
d
irrespective
of
the
very
high
abv
this
is
more
than
drinkable
for
the
style
and
i
recommend
it
as
an
end
to
an
evening
in
a
brandy
snifter
or
duvel
tulip
not
for
food
drinkability
i
dont
want
another
now
for
sure
i
did
enjoy
this
quite
a
bit
but
a
whole
750
is
too
much
for
one
person
this
thing
drinks
like
port
and
a
small
serving
would
be
better
taste
fierce
bright
alcohol
upfront
that
gives
way
to
the
most
delicious
yummy
sweetness
dramatic
180
here
the
finish
does
have
a
spicy
pepperyness
to
it
dark
chocolate
malt
flavor
with
some
nice
spicy
notes
especially
pepper
cinnamon
and
brown
sugar
there
are
also
some
nice
dark
fruit
notes
plum
raisin
fig
etc
as
well
as
some
brown
sugar
candi
sugar
subtle
hops
and
some
sweet
alcohol
warmth
in
the
finish
drinkability
i
would
definitely
have
this
again
but
on
another
day
worth
the
try
if
you
like
a
strong
intense

this
is
an
outstanding
quadrupel
that
put
me
in
the
happy
zone
by
the
bottom
of
the
first
glass
and
is
having
no
trouble
keeping
me
there
d
not
bad
but
not
excellent
either
pretty
average
when
compared
to
other
beers
within
the
style
there
is
alcohol
is
way
too
hot
in
this
one
it
could
definitely
benefit
from
some
aging
im
saying
that
in
my
book
this
one
is
quite
drinkable
flavorwise
but
being
12abv
you
wouldnt
need
to
have
more
than
a
couple
d
for
the
price
i
wouldnt
i
would
like
to
try
this
again
though
as
i
really
dont
think
the
bottle
is
sposed
to
blow
up
like
it
did
maybe
this
was
stored
poorly
or
somesuch
in
any
event
this
bottle
of
malheur

is
curious
and
has
merit
but
is
ultimately
flawed
ahh
well
you
cant

em
all
this
is

and

knock
though
the

to
get
a
bit
too
sweet
as
you
drink
big
flavors
of
prunes
and
figs
a
quality
and
heavy
brew
with
great
mouthfeel
and
flavors
might
even
be
great
with
dessert
or
as
an
after
dinner
drink
nice
and
well
made
likely
couldnt
drink
too
much
dark
muddy
brown
with
tons
of
sediment
and
a
light

belgian
quad
i
enjoyed
this
but
it
did
not
wow
me
like
some
of
the
other
quads
currently
on
the
market
drinkability
is
extremely
good
for
this
beer
considering
the
alcohol
level
it
is
not
overwhelming
at
all
this
beer
is
a
great
ager
as
well
overall
this
quad
has
a
lot
of
roasted
and
smoky
qualities
reminding
me
very
much
of
an
imperial
stout
or
porter
since
these
are
some
of
my
favourite
styles
i
found
this
brew
very
enjoyable
the
softness
of
palate
was
quite
a
treat
and
the
12
abv
was
only
noticeable
in
its
effects
not
in
the
taste
or
feel
a
very
enjoyable
an
dangerously
drinkable
beer
this
is
one
i
look
forward
to
having
again
this
poured
a
nearly
opaque
mahogany
with
considerable
sediment
and
fluffy
tan
head
it
smelled
very
malty
like
roasted
barley
and
caramel
and
nuts
with
a
bit
of
raisin
and
alcohol
perhaps
a
hint
of
grassy
hops
it
tasted
very
sweet
too
with
sugary
caramel
and
creamy
yeast
dominating
followed
by
nutty
and
wheat
malts
and
prune
and
a
bit
of
cinnamon
and
alcohol
it
was
slightly
thick
and
silky
with
moderate
carbonation
at
first
that
subsided
over
time
and
a
sweet
sour
aftertaste
overall
this
was
delicious
complex
and
delicious
it
had
fantastic
depth
to
the
flavor
that
im
sure
i
missed
part
of
it
had
a
nice
smooth
body
too
the
alcohol
wasnt
very
strong
considering
the
12
so
this
was
quite
easy
to
drink
this
was
my
favorite
belgian
ale
while
still
cold
since
i
usually
need
to
let
them
warm
up
and
mellow
out
before
i
can
fully
enjoy
them
but
this
was
immediately
great
and
only
improved
as
it
warmed
an
allaround
solid
brew
fresh
and
i
could
imagine
this
further
improving
with
age
d
very
drinkable
given
the
balance
texture
flavor
etc
the
12
abv
is
fairly
well
hidden
although
there
is
some
hotness
id
love
to
try
this
with
a
couple
more
years
on
it
flavors
are
mellow
and
balanced
lots
of
alcohol
coming
through
the
fruity
components
but
it
is
not
out
of
control
it
is
crisp
and
refreshing
as
well
as
giving
off
a
subtle
richness
that
is
very
satisfying
very
enjoyable
beer
perhaps
a
little
too
hot
for
everyday
sipping
but
this
would
be
great
on
a
cold
and
rainy
sunday
poured
into
a
chalice
a
very
nice
dark
brown
color
nice
carbonation
nice
onefinger
foamy
tannish
head
which
leaves
some
nice
sticky
lacing
behind
the
nose
is
malty
yeasty
some
dark
fruits
the
taste
is
very
nice
maltyyeasty
some
nice

nice

the
abv
is
hidden
very
well
with
this
one
very
drinkable
this
is
a
tasty
brew
overall
a
very
solid
quad
from
malheur
i
am
glad
i
picked
up
a
couple
of
these
to
put
some
age
on
defenitely
one
of
the
better
quads
ive
had
westy
12
is
still
my
baby
but
this
one
is
defenitely
a
good
alternative
would
like
to
see
some
smaller
bottles
around
but
man
this
is
good
stuff
this
beer
was
paired
with
a
pork
tenderloined
brined
with
the
beer
cheddar
scallion
potato
cake
and
a
parsnip
mushroom
bacon
mix
that
part
didnt
quite
fit

so
i
wont
give
the
fancy

a

the
dark

maltiness
and
subtleties
in

make
the
malheur
12
exceptionally
soft
in
the
mouth
but
the
beer
does
not
round
out
enough
in
the
end
to
make
it
really
drinkable
in
the
long
run
fantastic
beer
for
a
glass
but
reluctant
to
drink
continuously
drinkability
a
good
beer
in
the
style
belgian
quadrupel
had
this
at
the
metropolitan
in
baltimore
the
appearance
is
typical
quad
chocolate
brown
with
an
airy
off
white
head
the
smell
is
of
chocolate
and
alcohol
and
some
rich
roasted
malt
the
flavor
i
find
to
be
similar
if
not
better
than
st
bernadus
abt12
i
think
malheur
12
has
a
richer
chocolate
flavor
to
blend
with
the
alcohol
where
the
sbt12
lets
the
alcohol
to
do
more
of
the
talking
the
rich
chocolate
also
helps
the
balance
because
less
sharp
astringent
alcohol
you
test
the
easier
it
is
to
balance
with
a
little
hops
mouth
feel
is
bubbly
and
quick
to
evaporate
drinkability
is
good
for
a
quad
do
to
its
balance
which
is
do
to
its
rich
chocolate
malt
flavors
mouthfeel
and
drinkability
overall
thin
and
watery
if
you
ask
me
anything
coming
from
belgium
should
be
much
heartier
this
is
one
that
ill
not
ever
buy
again
im
glad
i
didnt
waste
money
on
a
fourpack
of
this
im
glad
that
i
received
this
as
a
free
sample
just
not
anywhere
near
to
par
in
my
book
it
just
doesnt
cut
it
as
any
type
of
beer
too
much
cough
syrup
going
on
in
here
this
is
a
good
desert
beer
i
think
id
like
to
enjoy
this
one
if
i
was
relaxing
on
the
back
porch
after
a
big
meal
watching
the
sun
go
down
ill
keep
this
one
on
the
list
until
the
next
time
that
happens
i
would
weakly
recommend
this
beer
i
had
this
bottle
at
paters
vaetje
monks
casket
in
antwerp
not
a
bad
beer
but
one
in
a
style
that
has
quite
a
few
top
beers
in
the
world
in
it
not
a
bad
beer
but
gouden
carolus
carolus
dor
is
cheaper
in
the
same
place
i
bought
this
and
a
superior
beer
not
bad
but
there
are
better
a
very
good
beer
a
good
pair
for
some
robust
flavors
but
for
sure
behind
the
holy
graals
of
quads
westwleteren
rochefort
and
st
bernardus
d
its
an
wonderful
after
dinner
or
late
evening
sipper
would
pair
up
nicely
with
a
cigar
a
drinkable
beer
for
sure
i
think
this
brew
could
be
a
real
contender
to
the
roc
line
unfortunately
the
alcohol
was
way
to
evident
and
knocked
this
brew
down
for
me
maybe
this
brew
needs
to
mellow
a
few
years
in
a
cellar
to
bring
out
more
flavors
to
mask
the
alcohol
drinkability
is
poor
due
to
the
evident
and
burning
alcohol
poured
i
drank
this
around
70
f
due
to
unusual
circumstances
out
a
dark
amber
color
it
was
almost
black
and
was
topped
with
a
slightly
tan
head
about
three
fingers
thick
and
very
fluffy
but
it
quickly
thinned
out
into
a
thin
ring
around
the
glass
thee
was
quit
a
bit
a
yeast
on
the
bottom
of
the
snifter
the
bottle
also
kept
on
foaming
and
the
head
just
kept
pouring
out
of
the
bottle
something
new
for
me
i
had
never
seen
this
before
there
is
some
very
active
carbonation
it
has
a
very
floral
aroma
thats
sweet
and
fruity
there
is
a
strong
alcohol
aroma
as
well
its
warm
on
the
tongue
and
very
smooth
there
is
a
very
faint
bitterness
to
it
on
the
sides
of
my
mouth
it
is
spicy
has
a
fairly
thick
body
it
leaves
a
dry
aftertaste
in
your
mouth
and
the
alcohol
is
really
evident
but
it
is
not
too
overwhelming
i
will
be
trying
this
beer
again
and
even
drinking
it
at
a
higher
temperature
than
normal
its
pretty
good
an
tasty
beer
while
it
does
not
do
a
good
job
of
hiding
its
substantial
strength
it
never
gets
hot
or
harsh
and
the
alcohol
seems
to
integrate
with
the
other
notes
the
light
body
on
this
brew
was
also
quite
nice
never
cloying
or
sticky
yet
still
rich
satisfying
and
a
sipping
brew
really
pretty
drinkable
for
what
it
is
my
expectations
were
low
after
tasting
the
ridiculously
sweet
malheur
10
but
i
was
pleasantly
surprised
when
the
sugars
were
only
slightly
overpowering
in
this
dark
brownburgundy
pour
full
creamy
foam
nose
could
be
better
but
it
has
some
dark
fruit
hops
and
yeast
flavor
is
awfully
complex
nicely
malty
with
lots
of
belgian
character
brown
sugar
caramel
toffee
along
with
hints
of
dark
fruits
well
balanced
its
a
really
nice
ale
mouthfeel
is
a
little
thin
and
a
little
too
carbonated
for
my
taste
its
not
awful
or
excessive
but
it
could
stand
to
be
fuller
luckily
despite
this
the
mighty
12
alcohol
is
not
detectable
in
the
flavor
it
does
however
warm
the
insides
fairly
drinkable
for
a
monstrous
beer
d
you
cant
really
judge
this
against
a
low
abv
session
beer
knowing
this
is
12
abv
full
of
flavor
on
every
sip
its
a
beer
to
spend
a
whole
night
with
not
as
thick
and
smooth
as
a
quad
should
be
and
a
bit
too
boozy
smells
great
though
this
variety
is
definitely
worth
a
try
though
im
not
sure
ill
be
tempted
to
have
another
chocolate

10
i
was
stoked
when
i
saw
this
one
on
the
shelf
but
for
the
price
of
a
decent
wine
i
have
no
desire
to
ever
try
it
again
again
the
balance
was
not
right
on
even
though
the
flavor
was
little
more
than
a
trinity
of
fruit
malt
and
alcohol
that
said
i
do
love
the
experience
of
drinking
a
75l
bottle
initial
expectations
initial
tastings
vs
final
thoughts
final
feelings
are
always
swayed
by
alcohol
and
the
possible
disappointment
of
spending
too
much
on
a
bottle
of
beer
sometimes
it
is
totally
worth
it
sometimes
it
is
whyd
i
buy
that
ill
stick
to
malheur
10
from
now
on
why
fix
whats
perfect
body
was
medium
and
carbonation
was
suprisingly
low
considering
how
explosive
the
opening
and
pouring
were
of
1100
beers
sampled
now
this
has
to
be
one
of
the
biggest
let
downs
ever
that
is
not
to
say
that
this
isnt
a
good
beer
because
it
is
but
i
really
do
not
believe
that
this
deserves
the
avg
rating
that
it
has
recommended
my
first
from
this
brewery
you
can
rest
assured
i
will
be
trying
more
a
well
rounded
great
tasting
beer
i
have
tasted
most
of
the
quality
belgians
and
this
rates
right
up
there
with
the
best
highly
recommended
i
highly
recommend
this
one
a
great
belgian
drinkability
a
highly
sippable
ale
that
leads
from
glass
to
glass
in
almost
no
time
full
and
creamy
with
good
use
of
carbonation
very
rich
and
still
well
balanced
good
brew
but
more
similar
to
a
bsda
than
my
idea
of
a
quad
drinkability
a
good
beer
with
plenty
of
flavor
and
complexity
for
the
most
part
im
enjoying
the
malheur
brews
final
verdict
while
this
doesnt
blow
my
mind
its
obviously
an
extremely
wellcrafted
beer
with
the
second
pour
i
swirled
and
dumped
the
yeast
in
for
the
hell
of
it
it
doesnt
seem
to
alter
the
taste
much
but
now
im
getting
an
interesting
perfumey
smell
coming
from
my
chalice
also
theres
a
distinct
almond
nuttiness
in
the
aftertaste
im
noticing
now
that
i
didnt
notice
before
glad
i
have
a
couple
more
bottles
as
i
think
this
one
deserves
further
investigation
i
have
a
feeling
this
is
one
of
those
beers
you
cant
fully
know
in
one
tasting
need
to
relax
and
let
the
subtleties
reveal
themselves
pours
dark
brown
with
a
big

darker

aroma

is

followed
by

some
dry

characteristics
which
are
quite
enjoyable
taste
is
also
dominated
by
some
dry

characteristics
with
some
nice
candi

notes
i
didnt
notice
that
much
of
a
hoppy
presence
as
i
was
expecting
but
nonetheless
i
very
much
enjoyed
the
experience
full
body
with
some
great
carbonation
and
no
alcohol
was
detectable

the
best

probably
would
benefit
from
a
few
years
in
a
cellar

with
a
potential
for

i

this

it
really

it

bubbled
down
into
a
denser

that
held
it
has
an
orange
liquor
smell
on
the
nose
it
has
a
strong
bitterness
across
the
tongue
but
leaves
a
slightly
sweet
aftertaste
it
was
thick
in
the
mouth
and
i
found
it
drinkable
although
youll
certainly
feel
it
after
a
while
curious
to
have
it
off
of
tap
ill
definatly
revisit
mouthfeel
o
a
bit
sweet
and
definitely
darker
the
licorice
note
exists
though
its
not
omnipotent
here
but
hard
not
to
say
its
quite
yummy
fun
getting
a
chance
to
try
it
straight
from
foreign
lands
its
not
anything
id
go
to

to
find

do
it
val
dieu
shows
why
the
legacy
of
belgian
ale
will
live
on
and
in
the
highest
of
quality
possible
its
a
unique
recipe
but
is
also
true
to
form
its
taste
is
simply
divine
the
flavor
is
incredibly
subtle
and
delicious
slightly
sweet
dark
fruits
some
dark
belgian
candi
sugar
that
hearty
grainy
flavor
comes
up
on
the
back
end
for
a
bit
of
balance
a
little
bit
of
alcohol
heat
on
the
back
and
a
little
bit
of
lingering
sweetness
incredible
subtlety
though
with
a
velvety
medium
body
and
prickly
carbonation
its
a
really
great
beer
for
being
so
big
it
drinks
so
easy
simple
but
well
blended
flavors
the
taste
is
a
classic
quad
malty
earth
with
hints
of
leather
and
almost
red
wine
there
is
a
noticeable
amount
of
alcohol
but
it
cuts
the
mouth
making
a
nice
dry
mouth
o
tasty
goes
down
easily
not
too
filling
strong
kick
good
representation
of
style
this
is
a
solid
quad
to
drink
for
a
while
if
youre
in
the
mood
for
the
style
this
beer
is
like
a
dessert
and
afterdinner
liqueur
all
rolled
into
one
my
only
gripe
is
that
the
booziness
while
delightful
is
perhaps
just
a
bit
too
prevalent
and
lends
the
beer
a
somewhat
cloying
character
reducing
the
drinkability
perhaps
my
palate
is
just
too
sensitive
and
is
overreacting
to
too
much
of
a
good
thing
at
any
rate
this
is
certainly
one
of
the
best
quads
i
have
had
yet
a
delightful
drinking
experience
i
must
recommend
to
every
fan
of
the
style
o
while
you
can
tell
that
this
is
a
strong
beer
from
the
sweetness
it
hides
its
alcohol
very
well
from
the
taste
this
is
exactly
how
i
like
my
quads
with
lots
of
fruits
and
a
good
amount
of
sweetness
drinkability
a
nice
beer
in
the
style
quadrupel
pours
a
clear
dark
orangebrown
with
a
foamy
tan
head
that
settles
to
a
film
on
top
of
the
beer
foamy
swaths
of
lace
form
around
the
glass
on
the
drink
down
smell
is
of
malt
brown
sugar
dark
fruit
and
slight
spice
aromas
taste
is
much
the
same
with
fruity
and
spice
flavors
on
the
finish
there
is
a
mild
amount
of
spice
bitterness
on
the
palate
with
each
sip
this
beer
has
a
lower
level
of
carbonation
with
a
slightly
crisp
and
medium
bodied
mouthfeel
overall
this
is
a
good
beer
that
is
tasty
and
easy
to
drink
ill
admit
i
did
represent
this
brewery
in
california
in
2007
and
found
all
their
brews
excellent
great
yeast
and
big
malt
profiles
the
grand
cru
has
a
touch
more
of
a
bite
than
the
others
but
nevertheless
a
lovely
beer
fresh
or
with
a
few
years
age
while
maybe
not
on
a
totally
even
par
with
the
rocheforts
and
westvleterens
of
this
focused
little
world
valdieus
grand
cru
i
just
love
saying
that
for
some
reason
still
comes
off
as
a
serious
player
in
both
flavour
and
otherworldly
complexity
i
still
cant
inwardly
reconcile
how
they
sneaked
a
21proof
abv
offering
past
me
so
cleanly
so
additional
kudos
for
that
o
definitely
a
rebuy
o
really
good
beer
great
aroma
flavor
is
not
on
par
with
the
very
best
quads
just
not
the
traditional
belgian
flavor
of
the
very
top
quads
has
a
lot
more
caramel
flavor
and
lacks
some
of
the
sweetness
never
the
less
this
is
a
really
good
beer
taste
is
chocolate
covered
bananas
with
a
dusting
of
cloves
interesting
and
tasty
belgian
offering
id
go
more
bsda
than
quad
but
that
is
mainly
due
to
the
spicy
zestiness
the
beer
throws
down
interesting
blend
of
flavors
but
a
bit
on
the
sweet
side
for
me
and
the
phenols
are
raging
aroma
and
flavor
of
dark
candied
fruit
caramel
toffee
clove
banana
tart
branston
pickle
ginger
lemon
and
orange
peel
and
honeyed
melon
cherries
grapes
and
pears
very
complex
and
appealing
with
just
the
right
level
of
carbonation
one
of
the
better
grand
crus
ive
tasted
o
one
of
the
best
quadrupels
ive
tried
in
a
while
or
ever
very
very
drinkable
pours
a
deep
reddish
orange
color
with
a
huge
bubbly
off
white
head
that
persists
forever
the
smell
is
quite
fruity
orange
and
cherries
and
raisins
in
front
of
a
solid
caramel
and
darker
sugar
back
drop
with
a
hint
of
alcohol
the
flavor
is
quite
fruity
as
well
with
orange
and
citrus
mixed
with
some
sweet
cherries
raisins
and
plums
a
solid
caramel
and
melanoidin
malt
sweetness
provides
a
nice
balance
against
the
fruit
theres
a
warming
alcohol
but
its
very
faint
and
never
harsh
medium
to
thick
body
with
a
moderate
to
high
level
of
carbonation
and
a
sweet
almost
syrupy
mouthfeel
this
is
a
very
nice
quad
the
citrus
flavor
adds
a
nice
dimension
to
this
brew
a
very
rewarding
and
in
every
sense
great
beer
man
this
was
a
damn
good
quad
it
was
extremely
flavorful
and
smooth
for
the
size
and
was
just
a
real
treat
to
end
our
meal
with
im
glad
we
can
get
these
beers
in
the
states
valdieu
is
on
my
radar
in
a
big
way
now
o
good
drinkability
nice
quad
mark
was
right
not
that
i
doubted
him
this
is
a
great
beer
cheers
mvery
drinkable
if
the
abv
wasnt
so
high
could
session
this
one
served
in
a
valdieu
chalice
which
was
a
nice
surprise
very
dark
brown
nearly
black
in
the
dim
lighting
with
an
attractive
silky
beige
covering
on
top
sweet
raisin
aromas
dominate
upfront
opening
up
to
reveal
strawberry
cherry
caramel
chocolate
banana
and
vanilla
very
nice
somewhat
less
fruity
flavor
though
the
raisin
continues
along
with
plum
fig
and
caramel
malt
no
booze
at
all
mediumfull
bodied
with
very
light
carbonation
making
it
satisfyingly
smooth
i
really
liked
this
one
o
a
beautiful
beer
that
ranks
up
there
with
some
of
the
best
quads
and
belgian
strong
dark
ales
that
i
have
tried
this
poured
out
as
a
deep
amberbrown
color
with
a
tan
colored
head
on
top
the
smell
of
the
beer
was
a
little
sour
ot
funky
it
worried
me
a
little
bit
i
was
expected
a
sweet
malty
aroma
and
i
got
something
that
reminded
me
of
a
wild
ale
the
taste
however
completely
made
up
for
the
aroma
the
sweet
malt
and
candy
like
flavors
that
a
quality
quad
has
were
in
there
and
very
pronounced
the
beer
tastes
sweet
with
minimal
bitterness
the
mouthfeel
was
pretty
good
it
was
moderately
thick
feeling
with
a
low
carbonation
to
it
overall
i
enjoyed
it
the
smell
still
doesnt
please
me
but
the
beer
in
general
is
quite
good
found
a
bottle
gathering
dust
at
one
of
the
beer
stores
on
my
regular
route
given
the
abv
and
the
quadness
i
figured
that
even
if
it
really
had
been
sitting
eternally
on
a
shelf
it
wouldnt
be
rotten
and
old
as
it
turns
out
this
really
wasnt
too
bad
but
it
leans
toward
being
grittysweet
similar
to
the
frosting
on
a
supermarket
sheet
cake
darkbrown
to
nearblack
decent
head
if
a
bit
thin
sugary
aroma
mixed
with
a
dr
peppery
pruniness
a
taste
of
peaches
and
figs
and
then
the
slightly
outofbounds
sugar
definitely
mellows
out
upon
warming
and
makes
a
nice
winter
accompaniment
to
beef
stew
popcorn
and
a
decent
hollywood
western
i
took
about
90
minutes
to
drink
half
the
bottle
by
the
bottom
of
the
glass
my
opinion
had
definitely
risen
although
that
may
just
have
been
the
10
5
talking
overall
this
one
surprised
me
i
really
liked
it
as
a

at
that
a
fine
example
of
a
quad
d
while
the
aroma
and
taste
were
great
this
is
still
a
big
beer
that
being
said
the
alcohol
really
mellowed
out
as
compared
to
the
fresh
version
the

brings
some
light
roast
as
well
as

in
fact
much
better
than
i
anticipated
this
beer
may
very
well
end
up
in
my
top
10
quadbsdas
a
good
quad
with
just
a
touch
too
much
alcohol
heat
deep
amber
in
color
bordering
on
a
nice
brown
with
a
small
head
of
light
off
white
color
that
quickly
faded
into
obscurity
and
left
some
nice
lacing
along
the
sides
of
the
glass
deep
boozy
aroma
here
lots
of
alcohol
present
along
with
some
nice
caramel
malts
and
a
touch
of
light
grassy
notes
as
it
warmed
some
nice
fruit
flavor
on
the
first
sip
but
this
is
drowned
out
quickly
by
the
hot
nature
of
the
booze
really
could
use
some
time
to
sit
down
as
it
is
just
too
fresh
i
feel
still
though
i
push
on
letting
it
warm
and
come
through
some
light
touches
of
raisins
perhaps
a
touch
of
light
fig
now
mixing
in
as
well
smooth
light
and
subtle
carbonation
leaves
the
mouth
dry
o
really
nice
beer
in
one
of
my
favorite
categories
opens
up
quite
a
bit
w
warming
if
you
see
it
buy
it
highly
recommended
served
on
tap
poured
into
a
chalice
a
dark
mahogany
brown
with
a
small
eggshell
head
that
left
some
nice
lacing
on
the
glass
aromas
of
dark
sugars
rich
maltiness
and
notes
of
dark
dried
fruit
nice
array
of
flavors
on
the
palate
with
yeasty
bread
brown
sugar
and
caramel
raisins
pears
plums
smooth
and
mediumbodied
and
pleasantly
drinkable
overall
this
is
an
amazing
beer
strong
full
bodied
flavor
with
a
great
complexity
and
lasting
finish
highly
recommended
o
i
believe
this
sets
the
standard
for
gran
crus
i
found
it
to
be
awesome
and
it
beer
be
at
9
overall
i
really
enjoyed
this
beer
i
paired
it
with
my
saltier
steak
and
it
was
perfect
an
excellent
quad
a
good
value
with
decent
aging
potential
maybe
not
enough
to
warrant
picking
up
a
6l
methuselah
but
its
nice
that
you
have
the
option
there
are
quads
out
there
that
have
more
complexity
and
bigger
flavor
profiles
compared
to
some
of
those
this
one
may
not
be
the
greatest
beer
on
the
planet
let
those
ones
stand
as
a
main
course
this
ones
for
dessert
o
one
of
the
better
quads
out
there
one
of
my
favorites
overall
a
nice
drink
but
lacking
the
usual
complexities
of
the
style
still
a
great
drink
and
well
worth
the
price
pours
dark
brown
relatively
opaque
with
some
great
head
and
retention
mild
spotty
lace
nose
of
dark
fruits
tons
of
spice
cloves
and
pepper
all
taking
on
a
subtler
and
well
integrated
flavour
given
the
5
years
of
age
on
it
taste
has
more
of
the
dark
fruits
plum
spice
and
a
nutty
quality
fruits
are
rich
as
is
the
body
grape
skins
and
chocolate
alcohol
hasnt
yet
disappeared
full
body
and
rich
feel
to
it
not
overwhelmingly
so
complex
and
a
nice
treat
a
nice
beer
but
i
dont
really
feel
impressed
by
it
it
lacks
the
dark
heady
flavors
that
i
generally
associate
with
this
style
and
after
a
while
starts
to
taste
a
tad
too
sweet
not
bad
but
i
was
expecting
something
more
and
ill
pass
on
this
in
the
future
jd
wonderful
beer
active
frothy
head
with
pour
used
a
new
belgium
47l
tulip
glass
color
is
dark
around
1823
lovibond
taste
was
sweet
with
hints
of
caramel
and
red
wine
had
a
sort
of
resin
aroma
very
active
on
the
palate
definetly
getting
more
for
the
price
i
found
it
d
this
is
a
top
shelf
quad
that
i
enjoyed
very
much
overall
this
is
a
very
fine
quad
not
complex
at
all
but
quite
tasty
and
easy
drinking
for
the
huge
abv
its
heft
renders
it
not
terribly
drinkable
but
impressive
nonetheless
this
beer
succeeds
in
every
aspect
except
the
most
important
flavor
maybe
this
bottle
needed
more
age
yet
with
a
cork
date
of
312
i
would
expect
this
to
have
been
bottled
in
2008
or
earlier
so
it
should
really
be
much
more
drinkable
than
it
is
but
recent
reviews
dont
match
previous
reviews
drinkability
heck
yes
get
one
and
enjoy
the
dark
flavors
that
await
brewerys
best
offering
maybe
750ml
bottle
10
i
have
always
passed
up
val
dieu
beers
and
for
some
reason
this
caught
my
eye
maybe
it
was
the
black
label
anyway
this
poured
a
very
dark
brown
and
looks
like
your
typical
belgian
quad
the
smell
was
fruity
and
sweet
almost
too
sweet
the
flavor
was
raisins
and
sweetness
cloying
sweetness
this
was
not
my
favorite
quad
and
now
i
may
know
better
about
buying
val
dieu
beers
drinkability
this
is
a
pretty
good
beer
but
not
that
great
of
a
quad
especially
for
an
actual
belgian
its
just
too
sweet
and
not
multifaceted
enough
it
was
enjoyable
enough
but
i
wont
buy
it
again
this
beer
is
a
little
hotter
and
a
sweeter
than
i
would
prefer
there
are
some
nice
notes
of
dark
fruits
soaked
in
alcohol
and
classic
belgian
yeast
strain
flavors
but
this
is
a
step
below
the
upper
echelon
of
belgian
quads
id
say
this
is
more
of
a
strong
dark
than
a
quad
but
all
around
its
a
great
brew
d
a
solid
quad
but
the
complexity
and
flavour
was
considerably
better
in
the
brune
which
i
had
back
in
the
day
in
all
i
enjoyed
this
beer
but
i
dont
think
its
something
i
would
seek
out
again
to
me
it
was
a
little
overpowering
and
less
subtle
and
complex
than
other
abbey
ales
the
body
was
full
rich
and
smooth
drinkability
was
great
couldnt
be
better
overall
a
true
gem
of
a
beer
worth
seeking
out
mouthfeel
is
full
bodied
smooth
well
balanced
tasty
and
lightly
boozy
a
nice
deep
ruby
colored
beer
with
about
a
finger
of
white
head
aroma
of
dark
fruits
bready
yeasts
some
mild
sweetness
taste
is
similar
to
the
smell
a
delicious
blend
of
fruit
spices
and
malt
the
10
5
abv
is
definitely
not
apparent
in
the
flavor
overall
i
really
enjoyed
this
one
of
course
its
not
something
id
have
more
than
one
of
in
a
sitting
but
id
certainly
have
one
again
very
nice
looking
dark
brown
with
ruby
hues
to
light
lots
of
sediment
huge
off
white
head
smells
of
cloves
bread
yummy
tastses
like
a
medium
to
thick
mouthfeel
tastes
of
cloves
belgian
yeast
a
little
bitterness
in
finish
almost
metallic
very
drinkable
nice
quadruple
nice
lacing
on
glass
finish
is
a
little
lacking
though
pours
a
murky
mediumdark
brown
color
with
a
white
head
the
aroma
is
cherries
dark
fruit
malt
and
some
sweetness
the
flavor
is
dark
fruit
with
a
strong
malty
sweetness
medium
mouthfeel
and
medium
carbonation
i
wont
ever
drink
this
cold
but
warmed
it
is
happy
for
the
taste
buds
and
the
warming
of
cheeks
worth
a
try
especially
if
you
like
the
style
probably
worth
a
trying
in
a
taste
test
next
to
something
similar
this
was
delicious
did
not
find
the
alcohol
imposing
or
even
really
noticeable
this
is
like
a
rich
dessert
one
is
plenty
but
you
cant
help
yourself
going
back
for
another
helping
pours
a
dense
black
body
that
leaves
a
big
head
and
lace
ring
down
the
entire
glass
a
mix
of
roasted
coffee
burnt
chocolate
toffee
oak
maple
im
picking
up
a
lot
of
malts
and
hints
of
fruit
a
thick
bodied
and
stick
beer
that
is
a
little
dry
has
a
large
portion
of
roasted
and
burnt
malts
with
some
sweetness
from
chocolate
vanilla
and
caramel
even
licorice
not
quite
sure
but
i
know
tasting
something
like
maple
or
molasses
along
with
a
berry
type
fruit
finish
is
dry
and
a
tad
bit
of
an
alcohol
burn
a
quality
quad
that
is
meant
to
sip
and
enjoy
for
a
very
long
time
its
just
that
heavy
and
like
a
meal
in
a
bottle
overall
highly
recommend
aging
this
one
if
only
they
made
it
more
convenient
by
placing
the
date
on
the
bottle
instead
of
the
cork
cant
believe
the
reviews
give
this
an
a
this
is
the
only
valdieu
offering
ive
had
and
the
only
quad
but
this
doesnt
come
close
to
american
belgium
offerings
from
allagash
and
ommegang
pour
black
with
not
a
thick
body
virtually
no
head
i
think
this
one
5
years
old
still
good
mouthfeel
conistency
spicey
aroma
taste
of
cocoa
and
licorice
predominately
still
very
nice
with
supper
rich
aged
taste
not
your
coriander
sweetish
spice
d
dangerously
so
buy
a
few
of
these
and
save
them
for
those
splendid
autumn
afternoons
d
this
beer
really
opens
up
as
it
warms
and
has
a
nice
mysterious
complexity
making
it
a
easy
drink
especially
for
a
10
50
abv
it
didnt
have
that
wow
flavor
that
pulled
in
lots
of
flavors
but
it
was
pleasant
to
drink
i
was
thoroughly
impressed
with
this
beer
just
silky
smooth
leaving
a
delectable
presence
on
the
palate
quite
an
easy
drinker
too
although
it
would
probably
be
best
to
keep
this
to
one
or
two
glasses
those
belgian
strong
dark
ales
and
quads
never
cease
to
amaze
me
with
their
ability
to
pack
an
amazing
flavorpunch
yet
retain
a
low
alcohol
presence
despite
the
high
abv
devery
day
beer
no
but
it
is
a
wonderfully
crafted
belgian
quad
that
could
be
considered
a
great
example
of
the
style
this
is
the
type
of
beer
that
i
strive
to
create
as
a
homebrewer
m
creamy
velvety
decent
carbonation
t
m
d
flavour
is
excellent
creamy
smooth
malts
again
a
bit
of
a
chocolate
and
some
breadiness
that
provides
something
of
a
fruitbread
hint
with
the
yeast
flavours
smooth
and
incredibly
easy
to
sip
liberally
mouthfeel
isnt
as
shimmering
rich
and
fullbodied
as
many
of
the
other
quads
out
there
but
its
amazingly
smooth
an
incredibly
tasty
beer
and
the
value
is
great
to
boot
recommended
drinking
overall
its
not
my
favorite
quad
there
are
many
great
examples
but
its
very
enjoyable
and
worth
a
try
if
youre
a
fan
of
the
style
d
too
strong
to
be
sessionable
but
goddamn
would
i
want
another
very
underrated
check
thsi
one
out
if
you
get
the
chance
one
of
the
best
quads
ive
ever
tried
although
the
head
is
large
and
dense
the
carbonation
is
rather
low
this
was
decent
but
tasted
like
coke
with
yeast
cant
say
it
is
my
favorite
or
even
one
of
the
best
of
the
style
this
beer
will
only
improve
i
am
already
very
impressed
time
to
set
a
couple
back
for
2
or
3
d
what
can
i
say
i
enjoyed
this
brew
it
is
worth
an
extended
taste
test
i
would
by
another
case
of
this
but
there
are
so
many
beers
to
try
i
will
move
on
for
now
notes
this
is
a
fantastic
belgian
ale
that
is
almost
like
a
belgian
stout
good
complexity
intriguing
depth
great
flavors
and
good
drinkability
im
going
to
go
snag
the
last
bottle
off
the
shelves
the
next
chance
i
get
now
if
i
could
just
get
my
hands
on
the
rest
of
the
valdieu
lineup
drinkability
is
pretty
good
one
of
the
fruiter
quads
big
flavor
without
being
a
palate
buster
the
light
body
also
really
drives
home
what
a
benchmark
example
this
is
of
the
style
d
a
very
drinkable
beer
i
could
easily
sip
this
all
night
although
the
high
abv
would
get
me
in
the
end
this
is
a
good
little
find
picked
it
up
while
in
spain
for
i
believe
6
euro
not
bad
for
75cl
i
could
see
this
being
a
gateway
to
some
of
the
more
complex
not
overly
aggressive
except
its
drop
kick
to
my
uvula
i
enjoyed
it
and
would
recommend
it
to
those
that
enjoy
this
style
comment
i
never
noticed
the
abv10
5and
this
is
the
charm
of
a
well
executed
and
dangerously
tasty
beer
drinkability
were
it
not
for
the
high
abv
i
wouldve
had
more
but
i
was
driving
so
i
shifted
to
something
with
a
lower
abv
next
time
i
come
here
not
driving
and
having
more
than
one
of
these
excellent
quad
i
liked
this
if
someone
was
getting
into
quads
id
point
them
in
this
direction
very
easy
drinker
for
10
5
tastes
perfect
excellent
excellent
and
perfect
giant
fruit
fresh
and
authentic
like
youre
on
a
grove
walking
amongst
the
fruit
and
you
just
pull
one
right
off
the
goddamn
vine
and
bite
into
it
what
fruit
these
are
i
do
not
know
its
really
fucking
tasty
though
moves
into
mediumbodied
red
wine
peppery
yeast
pleasant
alcoholic
zing
mouthfeel
is
probably
one
of
the
best
i
have
ever
had
it
has
this
creamy
texture
upfront
that
leads
to
a
refreshing
crispness
at
the
end
great
great
beer
put
on
to
try
again
list
overall
this
is
on
the
top
tier
of
quads
all
the
flavors
work
very
well
together
and
its
so
very
smooth
give
this
one
a
shot
if
you
see
it
around
the
taste
is
fruity
like
grapes
or
cherries
background
notes
are
sugar
and
caramel
very
very
nice
drink
alcohol
is
very
warming
but
this
is
an
easy
to
drink
beer
poured
into
a
chimay
glass
deep
brown
in
color
with
a
medium
head
low
carbonation
the
aroma
is
of
rasins
and
plum
the
taste
is
a
touch
of
sour
rasins
but
a
mix
that
is
warming
as
it
goes
down
the
alcohol
is
well
hidden
but
hits
you
at
the
end
the
body
if
full
and
rich
this
makes
for
and
enjoyable
drinking
experience
a
very
smooth
drink
with
a
good
amount
of
subtle
flavors
drinkability
great
example
of
the
style
i
often
see
the
other
val
dieus
around
but
this
should
be
more
widely
available
pours
a
dark
purpleblack
almost
prunelike
color
with
a
thin
offwhite
foamy
head
aroma
is
dominated
by
chocolate
maltiness
dark
fruit
and
toast
very
smooth
drinking
beer
that
masks
the
high
abv
very
well
smooth
creamy
maltiness
lasts
throughout
with
dark
chocolate
fig
toast
caramel
and
toffee
notes
slight
dry
finish
drinkability
a
damn
fine
beer
first
the
reason
its
a
4
0
its
sweet
intensely
sweet
with
tons
of
sugars
hanging
around
fruity
malty
etc
its
also
slightly
medicinal
in
the
phenolic
profile
which
is
enhanced
slightly
by
the
dominating
lighter
fruity
flavors
dimetapp
anyone
the
alcohols
also
pretty
high
on
the
other
hand
that
alcohols
well
hidden
the
phenolic
medicinal
quality
doesnt
come
through
as
strongly
in
the
taste
and
this
is
on
the
whole
a
really
damn
complex
and
good
beer
i
dont
know
if
i
can
in
good
faith
classify
it
as
a
quadrupel
theres
too
much
yeast
character
and
too
little
malt
character
but
regardless
give
it
a
try
recommended
highly
d
so
smooth
thin
and
complex
the
10
5
is
extremely
well
hidden
overall
this
is
a
great
grand
cru
andor
quad
this
pours
a
deep
mahogany
color
with
a
silky
beige
head
very
nice
lacing
as
well
the
nose
is
very
fruity
with
a
sweet
candy
bready
malts
and
a
good
amount
of
peppery
yeasts
the
flavor
is
full
of
ripe
earthy
fruits
spicy
yeasts
biscuity
malts
and
chocolate
creamy
body
is
well
carbonated
and
suits
this
style
perfectly
a
rich
yet
well
balanced
brew
from
val
dieu
ill
have
to
try
the
triple
next
bottle
poured
a
clear
deep
brown
color
ale
with
a
full
foamy
head
with
good
retention
and
great
lacing
aroma
consists
of
sweet
malt
with
some
candi
sugar
and
some
dry
fruit
characteristics
taste
is
also
a
well
balance
mix
between
rich
belgian
malt
with
notes
of
candi
sugar
and
some
dry
fruits
such
as
raisins
and
plums
full
body
with
good
carbonation
and
no
apparent
alcohol
very
well
done
and
some
thing
that
i
would
have
on
a
regular
basis
great
drinkability
on
this
a
little
high
in
the
alcohol
department
to
drink
too
many
of
these
in
one
sitting
i
guess
though
it
depends
how
the
night
goes
would
go
perfectly
on
a
picnic
or
another
hot
day
when
you
normally
would
not
want
to
bottoms
up
a
quad
this
was
my
first
taste
of
valdieu
gran
cru
and
let
me
tell
you
that
it
wont
be
the
last
like
i
just
read
by
another
taster
it
has
such
a
silky
smooth
mouth
feel
and
the
lightly
well
balanced
fruity
taste
was
well
balanced
with
the
high
gravity
alcohol
level
there
is
also
a
slight
spice
taste
that
only
sneaks
in
and
doesnt
take
over
i
might
just
have
to
visit
brasserie
de
labbey
du
valdieu
in
aubel
belgium
someday
and
thank
them
for
such
a
well
done
brew
d
this
is
a
very
good
quad
only
drawback
is
that
it
became
very
heavy
by
the
end
d
very
good
clear
dark
auburn
big
rocky
cap
of
tan
froth
recedes
gradually
and
leaves
nice
swaths
of
lace
aroma
is
full
of
sweet
candy
yeasty
estery
goodness
and
warm
biscuity
malt
tones
very
solid
flavor
profile
that
exhibits
more
earthiness
than
the
aroma
led
on
to
the
candy
like
maltiness
lends
a
sweetness
to
the
overall
impression
subtle
spice
and
subtle
cookie
dough
yeastiness
everything
is
so
subtle
yet
so
perfect
as
well
this
is
truly
an
intricate
work
of
art
cinnamon
and
cardamon
earthy
fruitiness
mouthfeel
is
like
cotton
so
damn
smooth
this
beer
wilts
away
in
the
mouth
like
cotton
candy
this
whole
experience
is
exceptional
great
great
beer
owe
a
thanks
to
the
zapster
for
this
bday
present
next
time
i
crack
one
of
these
ill
have
to
whip
up
some
lobster
salad
and
salmon
steaks
on
the
grill
and
truly
make
it
an
evening
of
decadence
this
is
big
sweet
quad
with
enough
spice
to
make
you
wonder
if
the
yeast
can
really
do
that
much
work
its
fruity
of
course
with
dark
fruit
of
blackberries
dates
and
raisins
the
spice
elements
is
all
very
smooth
with
light
vanilla
corriander
white
pepper
and
cinnamon
my
only
complaint
is
that
while
this
doesnt
drink
cloyingly
sweet
it
can
become
a
little
much
and
this
is
a
mustshare
beer
750ml
bottle
cork
says
1109
i
dont
know
what
that
means
really
if
its
2009
thats
in
the
future
so
its
not
bottled
date
and
its
too
soon
to
be
drink
before
for
a
bottle
conditioned
ale
north
of
10
oh
well
some
things
are
not
for
the
knowing
pours
absolutely
perfectly
black
with
a
dense
creamy
head
that
leaves
lacing
that
makes
me
want
to
lick
the
glass
clean
smell
is
brown
sugar
raisins
cherries
vanilla
sawdust
and
lemons
taste
is
oak
cinnamon
raisins
and
cloves
much
drier
than
i
expected
with
an
almost
puckering
finish
very
nice
indeed
mouthfeel
supports
the
appearance
creamy
with
a
nice
tingle
of
carbonation
to
offset
it
drinkability
is
excellent
the
bonedry
finish
not
withstanding
still
wont
be
an
issue
at
all
to
polish
off
the
whole
bottle
definitely
worth
the
trouble
to
acquire
aged
bottle
not
sure
how
old
but
says
0310
on
the
cork
guessing
about
4
12
years
old
pretty
much
the
same
as
i
remember
it
being
fresh
but
super
smooth
hardly
any
alcohol
or
solvent
quite
sweet
quite
delicious
everything
is
quite
integrated
into
one
cohesive
whole
sort
of
like
christmas
pudding
very
nice
beer
it
aged
gracefully
randomly
picked
from
the
shelf
with
no
expectations
had
never
even
heard
of
it
i
was
immediately
impressed
pours
dark
as
can
be
not
quite
black
but
a
tremendously
dark
brown
thick
offwhite
head
with
decent
retention
and
ok
lacing
smell
is
of
a
typical
belgian
some
bread
and
yeast
a
touch
of
sweet
fruit
and
a
bit
of
alcohol
a
little
heavy
on
the
bread
smell
taste
is
great
it
has
a
very
sweet
taste
to
it
very
sweet
sugar
almost
duvelish
plenty
of
fruit
flavors
a
little
grassy
taste
and
a
warming
alcohol
taste
as
it
goes
down
medium
bodied
with
low
carbonation
a
very
smooth
drinker
the
10
5
abv
is
impressive
but
whats
more
impressive
is
how
well
its
hidden
this
is
a
truely
great
beer
and
one
i
will
definitely
revisit
in
the
future
very
very
nice
dessert
beer
mediumheavy
body
its
not
really
that
viscous
but
once
it
hits
the
tongue
it
really
coats
everything
nicely
very
drinkable
if
it
were
cheaper
i
would
buy
a
ton
of
this
stuff
wonderful
beer
poured
from
from
caged
and
corked
750ml
bottle
smells
of
raisins
and
fermented
apples
deep
brown
color
thin
foamy
head
with
nice
lacing
head
diminishes
over
time
first
sip
of
the
dark
caramelgoodness
is
raisinplum
with
citrius
and
vanillla
notes
slight
alcohol
taste
upfront
alcohol
becomes
more
noticeable
as
if
warms
nice
finish
apples
caramel
and
yeast
become
more
prevalent
as
beer
warms
complex
but
not
cloying
as
some
other
quads
fantastic
beer
highly
recommend
if
you
can
find
took
my
bro
and
i
2yrs
to
find
our
second
bottle
good
smooth
slightly
fluffy
full
body
that
is
a
pleasure
to
consume
a
very
good
solid
quad
that
i
fully
recommend
chalk
another
one
up
for
belgium
fabulous
stuff
just
absolute
nectar
there
are
a
number
of
better
quadrupels
out
there
but
this
one
is
still
very
pleasant
and
worthwhile
d
it
was
full
bodied
and
had
a
high
abv
that
might
limit
its
functionality
as
a
session
brew
it
is
a
sipper
and
a
wonderful
treat
to
share
with
friends
i
intend
to
add
it
to
my
stash
for
special
occasions
glad
i
tried
it
and
nothing
wrong
with
it
but
there
are
other
quads
i
prefer
a
very
nice
quadrupel
its
nice
to
know
there
are
so
many
good
quads
on
the
market
the
flavours
hung
around
in
the
mouth
and
although
it
is
a
strong
beer
the
thickness
wasnt
rich
or
pudding
like
cant
put
my
finger
on
it
but
something
was
missing
which
is
why
the
drinkability
is
only
a
3
5
score
the
no
show
of
any
aroma
doesnt
help
either
highly
recommended
a
very
tasty
quad
indeed
if
not
one
that
you
can
afford
to
drink
every
day
drinkability
this
beer
represented
the
style
well
and
is
a
slow
sipper
alcohol
will
catch
up
to
you
with
this
one
nice
beer
worth
finding
burgundy
color
with
a
full
and
creamy
foam
that
lasts
lightly
aromatic
with
hints
of
burnt
popcorn
brandy
dark
fruit
plum
and
the
attributes
of
belgian
yeast
flavor
is
very
rich
and
full
with
extremely
well
hidden
alcohol
fruit
chocolate
and
belgian
yeast
pours
very
dark
with
very
little
head
that
dissipates
quickly
aroma
is
lots
of
malt
dark
fruits
and
a
little
bit
of
spice
the
alcohol
is
barely
present
in
the
aroma
and
does
not
even
come
to
the
front
in
the
taste
mouthfeel
and
carbonation
are
very
nice
but
this
beer
is
way
too
sweet
for
me
i
love
quads
but
i
think
i
would
turn
this
down
next
time
give
me
a
rochfort
or
pennepot
fishermans
ale
instead
d
pretty
good
id
have
it
again
but
i
am
in
no
hurry
to
do
so
pours
very
very
dark
nearly
black
with
only
shy
tawny
highlights
that
show
up
with
the
liquid
at
a
very
low
level
strong
brussels
lacing
little
head
one
of
the
darkest
belgians
ive
ever
seen
aromas
are
predominantly
sweet
with
roasted
coffee
cola
dark
candi
sugar
and
some
bubble
gum
leading
the
way
very
rich
sumptuous
aroma
on
the
palate
cola
tastes
lead
the
way
from
syrupy
sweetness
right
down
to
that
tarty
cola
tang
nutty
at
the
midpalate
then
creamy
before
drying
out
at
the
finish
mouthfeel
is
full
of
carbonation
and
thick
malts
overall
this
is
a
big
sweet
smooth
quadrupel
i
wasnt
crazy
about
the
cola
flavors
but
its
in
line
with
style
and
well
executed
very
good
a
pretty
decent
belgian
quad
here
valdieus
grand
cru
is
by
far
one
of
the
better
top
notch
brews
to
be
produced
by
them
and
worth
giving
a
try
the
unique
effect
of
body
from
start
to
never
ending
finish
in
flavor
and
tone
is
the
best
partheart
of
the
whole
beer
and
the
main
reason
to
seek
it
out
taste
mmmmmmmespresso
whispers
cola
hushes
dark
fruits
and
anise
black
pepper
peeps
in
black
and
chocolate
malt
and
delicious
belgian
malt
and
yeast
mmm
darkness
and
spice
aplenty
yuum
thats
what
makes
this
special
this
particular
sparkling
spiciness
a
bit
rough
in
the
texture
burrs
against
the
buds
to
much
methinks
but
then
this
unique
and
wondrous
flavor
creeps
in
too
much
mouthfelldrinkability
the
mouthfeel
is
full
bodied
with
a
nice
smooth
carbonation
and
the
drinkability
would
fantastic
if
the
alcohol
was
not
so
high
wonderful
beer
wish
i
had
a
caseful
at
hand
alas
and
alack
we
went
to
ebenezers
pub
in
lovell
me
for
a
party
and
chris
had
a
metheuslah
of
this
beer
besides
the
impressive
presentation
this
is
a
very
good
beer
a
brown
color
with
a
medium
head
that
lingered
well
sweet
fruity
aroma
a
nice
vanilla
taste
with
the
dark
fruit
and
belgian
yeast
present
also
lovely
beer
very
smooth
didnt
know
it
was
10
5
abv
until
i
was
admiring
the
bottle
for
a
beer
that
is
10
5
alcohol
this
is
very
smooth
and
i
definitely
put
it
right
up
with
the
other
quadrupels
i
have
tried
3
philosophers
and
st
bernardus
great
beer
pick
it
up
if
you
ever
find
it
wow
this
is
one
of
the
better
quadsnoels
that
ive
had
in
some
time
great
flavor
well
balanced
and
enjoyable
from
first
sip
to
the
bottom
of
the
bottle
ill
probably
pick
up
another
few
bottles
to
lay
down
for
a
few
years
i
think
that
this
will
age
very
very
well
highly
recommended
oily
slick
mouthfeel
full
bodied
and
rich
but
never
wee
sticky
im
drinking
this
way
too
fast
for
the
alcohol
the
beer
is
amazingly
balanced
this
is
crafted
as
well
as
any
belgian
quad
an
awesome
beer
my
favorite
rr
poured
a
dark
brown
in
color
with
burgundy
highlights
and
a
half
finger
of
head
that
left
some
good
bubbly
lacing
sticking
to
the
glass
plenty
of
dark
fruit
is
noticeable
upfront
in
the
nose
with
nice
belgian
yeast
sweetness
slight
candi
sugar
booze
is
present
and
hints
of
brown
sugar
the
belgian
yeast
character
was
more
apparent
on
the
palate
alongside
dark
fruit
accents
welll
balanced
booze
that
was
not
overwhelming
subtlt
brown
and
candi
sugar
but
with
mild
spice
the
brew
was
medium
in
body
with
good
amount
of
carbonation
which
has
a
sweet
yeasty
dark
fruity
slightly
boozy
and
sticky
finish
finally
got
to
tick
this
beer
after
some
years
of
chasing
yeeahh
pours
a
hazy
orangebrown
with
a
foamy
khaki
head
that
settles
to
wisps
of
film
on
top
of
the
beer
small
dots
of
lace
slowly
drip
into
the
remaining
beer
on
the
drink
down
smell
is
of
malt
brown
sugar
dark
fruits
and
spices
taste
is
much
the
same
with
an
alcohol
kick
on
the
finish
there
is
a
mild
amount
of
spice
bitterness
on
the
palate
with
each
sip
this
beer
has
a
lower
level
of
carbonation
with
a
slightly
crisp
and
medium
bodied
mouthfeel
overall
this
is
a
pretty
good
beer
with
some
solid
aromas
and
flavors
o
good
beer
poor
quad
might
have
again
another
tick
on
the
russian
river
tion
quest
that
i
started
quite
awhile
back
big
thanks
goes
out
to
estocker
for
sending
me
this
one
a
long
time
back
shared
this
one
at
aashers
wedding
reception
with
as
many
people
in
the
wedding
party
as
i
could
find
served
from
growler
into
a
boulevard
tulip
poured
a
ruby
redbrown
with
a
two
finger
offwhite
head
that
subsided
to
a
half
finger
slowly
maintained
nice
lacing
throughout
the
glass
the
aroma
was
comprised
of
sweet
malt
dark
fruit
bread
and
banana
the
flavor
was
of
sweet
mat
fruit
banana
bread
and
dark
fruit
it
had
a
medium
feel
on
the
palate
with
medium
carbonation
overall
this
was
a
good
brew
as
far
as
quadruples
go
this
was
a
fairly
solid
one
all
the
proper
flavors
and
aromas
going
on
in
all
the
right
intensities
there
was
absolutely
no
sign
of
the
alcohol
in
this
one
at
all
this
was
definitely
a
scary
aspect
as
im
sure
the
right
person
could
crush
a
64
oz
growler
without
a
problem
im
just
glad
i
had
help
that
all
seemed
to
enjoy
it
as
well
definitely
worth
trying
if
you
get
the
chance
to
do
so
d
very
drinkable
nice
balance
of
big
sweetness
and
warming
earthy
flavors
not
overly
boozy
oa
decent
quad
but
is
missing
the
complexity
of
my
belgian
favorites
like
st
bernardus
and
the
alcohol
is
clearly
present
yet
to
find
a
good
american
version
of
this
style
b
t
dark
fruits
upfront
with
some
bready
malt
toasted
rye
and
a
touch
of
earthy
hops
on
the
finish
maybe
the
best
american
quad
ive
had
to
date
but
it
has
nothing
on
the
complexities
found
in
some
of
the
better
belgian
quads
o
a
top
notch
quad
up
near
my
favorite
quads
westvleteren
12
de
struise
st
amatus
12
they
should
start
bottling
this
one
insert
something
witty
here
i
got
nothin
o
this
quad
is
really
good
well
balance
very
drinkable
and
complex
enough
for
you
to
want
to
keep
coming
back
o
strange
quad
strange
beer
and
not
my
favorite
from
the
brewery
not
what
i
was
expecting
in
a
quad
but
not
a
terrible
beer
in
and
of
itself
pours
a
dark
brown
with
a
hint
of
red
almost
a
purple
color
with
a
tiny
white
head
scent
is
heavy
with
dark
fruits
biscuits
and
caramel
malt
are
present
as
well
a
little
bit
of
candied
sugar
and
prunes
taste
is
initially
sweet
malt
flavors
immediately
followed
by
dark
fruits
and
belgian
yeast
flavors
a
little
bit
of
breadlike
flavors
with
just
a
hint
of
booze
mouthfeel
is
full
bodied
and
creamysmooth
drinkability
is
high
overall
this
is
a
fantastic
quad
i
love
it
and
if
not
for
the
high
abv
i
could
have
a
few
of
these
in
one
sitting
a
very
good
quad
though
not
as
good
as
i
remember
the
first
batch
being
still
its
very
tasty
o
good
quad
glad
i
got
to
try
this
one
great
way
to
start
a
tasting
but
no
more
than
one
in
a
sitting
but
for
me
thats
not
unusual
for
a
quad
as
the
candy
sugar
flavors
are
a
bit
much
after
1
glass
o
well
rr
never
lets
me
down
and
i
had
reservation
about
this
one
from
jump
street
a
nice
quad
and
one
that
is
super
drinkable
even
fresh
id
like
to
see
what
a
bottle
of
this
would
do
with
some
time
down
d
another
solid
take
on
a
style
by
the
rr
crew
i
dont
see
why
this
is
not
rated
higher
its
more
drinkable
than
most
authentic
belgians
in
the
same
vain
i
dont
want
to
sound
like
a
rr
fanboy
but
they
can
do
no
wrong
a
a
deep
root
beer
color
and
opacity
thin
white
head
s
rich
toffee
hops
coffee
and
sugar
t
toffee
raisin
some
sourness
and
hops
its
on
the
sweeter
side
m
full
and
round
smooth
o
pretty
awesome
beer
on
tap
at
russian
river
high
abv
makes
it
hard
to
drink
more
than
one
cant
wait
until
next
year
to
repeat
the
cycle
but
now
i
have
my
own
rr
growler
to
refill
beer
is
medium
in
body
and
really
sweet
on
lead
off
the
beer
unfolds
to
reveal
almost
no
interesting
yeast
character
and
an
overly
bitter
finish
not
pleasant
d
a
pretty
nice
quad
from
russian
river
lots
of
dark
fruits
and
bready
malts
and
it
had
a
great
mouthfeel
would
have
again
pour
yields
a
mahoganycolored
beer
with
a
good
offwhite
head
and
a
bit
of
lacing
as
it
goes
down
the
sides
of
the
glass
not
quite
as
much
as
id
normally
like
to
see
from
a
quad
but
given
the
fact
that
this
is
a
quad
from
a
growler
ill
give
it
a
break
there
the
nose
contains
a
good
amount
of
dark
fruitsmostly
raisins
and
prunesalong
with
some
caramel
notes
and
some
toasted
bread
the
flavor
hits
along
the
same
lines
focusing
on
the
dark
fruits
and
mild
bread
character
and
then
finishes
with
a
bit
of
dry
bitterness
pretty
good
but
not
the
sort
of
complexity
i
expect
from
a
quad
and
especially
from
russian
river
feel
is
medium
with
lower
levels
of
carbonation
and
a
dry
finish
which
i
quite
enjoyed
definitely
drinkable
for
the
styleit
blew
me
away
when
i
found
out
this
was
10
5
though
i
suppose
i
should
have
suspected
something
in
that
range
d
i
want
to
drink
this
beer
a
lot
but
one
and
im
done
underwhelming
a
mediocre
beer
from
what
is
possibly
the
best
brewery
in
the
country
not
nearly
in
the
same
league
with
the
great
belgian
quads
like
rochefort
chimay
westvleteren
st
bernardus
abt
12
etc
a
great
solid
mouthfeel
that
makes
this
drinkable
at
10
5
it
has
no
noticeable
alcohol
notes
in
it
other
than
a
strong
buzz
in
my
head
after
drinking
three
glasses
it
could
do
with
a
lighter
carbonation
but
criticisms
about
the
sweetness
are
invalid
in
my
mind
i
thought
this
was
a
solid
beer
and
would
order
anywhere
available
on
a
positive
note
nice
mellow
belgian
yeast
flavor
with
no
musty
aftertaste
medium
body
with
low
carbonation
levels
makes
the
beer
a
bit
slick
on
the
tongue
finishing
sweet
and
boozy
on
the
tongue
definitely
a
sipper
though
the
one
dimension
flavor
profile
is
a
bit
disappointing
a
solid
beer
but
not
one
of
the
better
efforts
ive
had
from
rr
that
probably
speaks
more
to
my
expectations
when
it
comes
to
trying
new
rr
beers
rather
than
any
actual
flaws
in
mortification
pours
a
very
dark
yet
clear
rubyred
color

a
big
light
tan

with
good
retention
aroma
is
light
but
has
hints
of

and
some

smooth

strong

but
no

jd
overall
good
quad
d
this
was
quite
different
i
enjoyed
it
but
its
not
exactly
what
i
was
anticipating
still
worth
trying
out
of
course
and
the
complexity
of
it
kept
me
interested
another
great
beer
from
russian
river
pours
like
an
amontillado
in
color
with
a
huge
creamy
head
that
fades
to
a
thin
cap
and
leaves
some
nice
lacing
impressive
for
a
growler
smells
soft
vinous
of
red
fruit
and
brambly
followed
by
the
slightest
hint
of
sour
cherry
tastes
as
fantastic
as

pretty

d
glad
to
get
another
tion
brew
from
russian
river
under
my
belt
and
a
rare
one
to
boot
while
i
dont
have
a
whole
lot
of
quad
experience
i
found
this
one
to
be
pretty
damn
good
good
but
a
bit
of
a
disappointment
russian
river
makes
a
quad
seems
like
some
kind
of
dream
beer
description
to
me
unfortunately
i
found
this
beer
good
but
disappointing
as
a
quad
and
as
a
russian
river
beer
its
still
quite
good
of
course
mortification
pours
a
deep
garnet
with
little
head
and
a
bit
lacing
the
aroma
is
fairly
mild
with
some
bananas
some
plums
some
spice
and
a
whiff
of
sour
cherries
the
sour
comes
through
a
touch
in
the
flavor
but
its
almost
as
though
the
brewery
saw
a
bit
of
crosspollination
from
the
sour
barrels
rather
than
they
were
really
going
for
a
lightly
sour
quad
its
fairly
dry
especially
for
a
quad
it
actually
reminds
me
of
a
dry
barleywine
mixed
with
a
tripel
for
some
reason
the
flavors
dont
punch
as
much
as
i
would
like
but
then
again
the
dryness
is
a
nice
contrast
to
more
normal
pitfall
of
a
cloyingly
sweet
quad
another
nice
upside
to
the
beer
is
that
it
hides
the
abv
almost
entirely
im
pretty
shocked
to
see
it
listed
here
as
11
abv
this
was
my
second
time
tasting
this
beer
and
im
still
confused
by
it
a
deceptively
drinkable
11
beer
i
was
surprised
by
how
much
pineapple
flavor
was
in
this
one
the
citrus
gives
it
a
uniqueness
to
most
quads
that
are
dominated
by
raisins
and
other
dark
stone
fruits
d
fairly
easy
to
drink
didnt
knock
my
socks
off
right
away
but
i
quickly
grew
into
it
comfortably
would
buy
if
they
bottled
it
outstanding
drinkability
pretty
dang
easy
to
quaff
really
no
alcohol
heat
is
present
at
all
sort
of
just
like
liquid
candy
at
11
thats
no
small
feat
nice
all
around
quad
but
a
little
odd
i
was
really
hoping
this
would
make
it
there
and
i
am
glad
it
did
it
was
actually
the
only
russian
river
brew
on
draft
got
quite
lucky
with
this
one
would
not
quite
call
this
quad
it
reminded
me
more
of
a
barleywine
especially
with
its
hop
profile
i
would
like
to
have
this
again
recommended
overall
i
tried
it
because
it
was
there
good
but
not
something
i
will
quest
after
but
that
is
just
my
personal
preferance
drinkability
is
pretty
dangerous
wow
is
this
one
smooth
quad
while
you
can
taste
the
booze
its
not
relaly
hot
or
anything
and
overall
really
dangerous
overall
this
isnt
as
complex
as
some
of
the
worldclass
quads
but
the
flavors
all
work
very
well
together
certainly
worth
a
shot
this
is
one
of
the
more
drinkable
quads
ive
tasted
as
its
on
the
lighter
side
of
things
and
with
a
noticeably
vinous
quality
to
things
another
terrific
brew
from
russian
river

d
for
not

i
like
alot
i
liked
this
beer
d
this
was
excellent
rarely
disappointed
from
rrs
offerings
on

toronado
sd
lots
of
carbination
with
a
swirl
all
the
way
till
the
end
great
aroma
woody
some
sweet

and
with
a
nice
finish
minerals
and
acidity
keep
it
from
being
too
sweet

warmer
great
for
a
cold
night
nice
quad
barley
wine
and
easy
to
drink
for
the
style
had
on
draft
at
tornado
sd
great
coming
off
the
tap
but
its
heavy
and
should
be
enjoyed
without
the
mac
n
cheese
plate
served
there
reminded
me
a
lot
of
traditional
winter
beers
with
a
dark
color
fruity
smell
and
flavoring
and
heavy
feel
to
it
definitely
worth
a
second
go
the
next
time
im
there
d
very
much
so
but
what
from
russian
river
isnt
d
id
like
to
have
this
again
i
could
definitely
have
a
couple
of
pints
tm
huge
maltiness
but
not
overly
sweet
russian
river
brews
their
belgians
on
the
dry
side
something
that
i
really
appreciate
figgy
fruit
notes
of
date
graham
cracker
and
just
a
touch
of
licorice
medium
body
finishes
semidry
almost
crisp
deceptively
drinkable
theres
absolutely
no
trace
of
the
high
abv
very
tasty
strong
brew
good
for
getting
over
a
hard
day
at
work
overall
its
decent
but
not
quite
the
level
of
the
true
belgian
versions
o
huge
flavors
with
some
nice
dark
fruity
notes
wasnt
a
fan
of
the
mouthfeel
but
a
worthy
american
example
of
the
style
overall
not
harpoons
best
offering
although
it
is
still
significantly
better
than
it
was
fresh
the
alcohol
has
mellowed
and
it
has
become
a
pretty
decent
sipping
beer
there
was
no
real
front
or
back
to
the
beer
you
had
a
big
burst
of
flavor
and
then
it
cut
off
o
harpoon
gives
this
style
a
decent
effort
but
it
is
a
bit
hot
in
the
alcohol
presence
and
it
may
need
to
rest
a
few
years
to
mellow
decent
fruit
esters
and
nice
peppery
bite
give
the
drink
some
good
interest

d
likely
not
something
i
would
pick
up
again
considering
the
whole
cherry
cough
syrup
thing
a
little
disappointed
considering
my
enjoyment
of
the
other
leviathan
line
offerings
o
overall
this
is
a
very
interesting
beer
and
the
first
quad
i
have
ever
had
if
this
is
considered
to
be
a
bad
quad
i
cannot
wait
for
rochefort
10
not
the
worlds
greatest
quad
but
i
found
this
to
be
a
fairly
drinkable
and
pretty
tasty
take
on
the
style
a
mess
of
a
brew
i
was
very
disappointed
with
this
brew
its
becoming
more
and
more
rare
to
find
a
good
quad
maybe
i
should
give
them
up
this
one
didnt
end
up
in
the
drain
but
its
not
recommended
12

and
a

some
pretty

it

boozy
and
not
as

as
i
was
hoping
no
cloying

mediumlow
carbonation
and
fairly
full

with
a
fairly
slick

thick
mouthfeel
that
is

alcohol
presence
is
quite
noticeable
with
a
large
lasting
warming
on
the
finish
overall
this
is
an
ok
quad
decent
flavor
balance
and
complexity
and
pretty
smooth
to
sip
on
slowly
i
always
have
high
expectations
for
harpoon
leviathan
beers
and
this
one
does
not
meet
them
omaybe
with
some
aging
the
alcohol
will
calm
down
because
this
beer
has
to
much
alcohol
overall
a
decent
quad
but
a
bit
too
boozy
in
the
nose
and
taste
for
me
originally
reviewed
02222011
the
beer
pours
a
dark
reddishbrown
color
with
a
tan
head
the
aroma
is
full
of
cherries
and
plums
as
well
as
some
bread
and
brown
sugar
the
alcohol
is
also
quite
present
the
flavor
is
similar
the
beer
is
very
boozy
but
the
dark
fruit
candy
sugar
and
belgian
yeast
notes
also
are
strong
the
beer
is
very
fruity
overall
with
a
lot
of
cherries
and
figs
in
the
flavor
medium
to
thick
mouthfeel
and
medium
carbonation
o
i
gave
this
beer
a
legitimate
shot
but
it
just
didnt
bring
much
enjoyment
for
me
im
not
against
a
big
presence
of
alcohol
but
in
this
case
it
took
away
from
accompanying
flavors
instead
of
enhancing
them
i
might
try
this
beer
again
down
the
road
but
only
a
bottle
with
significant
age
in
hopes
of
mellowing
out
the
heat
and
a
more
harmonious
flavor
overall
its
big
sweet
and
belgianesque
but
it
doesnt
hold
a
candle
to
the
principal
belgian
quads
or
even
many
of
the
domestic
american
renditions
poured
from
a
12
oz
bottle
into
a
pint
glass
2012
edition
this
pours
a
darkish
brown
color
with
a
long
lasting
massive
tan
head
the
smells
are
of
yeast
esters
some
ripe
bananas
brown
sugar
a
little
caramel
the
feel
is
medium
to
slightly
thick
the
taste
is
of
brown
sugar
ripe
fruit
and
alcohol
i
havent
liked
the
other
3
or
4
harpoon
beers
ive
tried
because
i
think
their
house
yeast
strain
is
awful
so
knowing
that
they
brewed
this
with
a
trappist
yeast
strain
is
why
i
tried
this
one
this
is
a
really
good
if
not
great
american
version
of
a
belgian
quad
better
than
many
other
american
brewed
belgian
quads
up
there
with
allagash
and
avery
i
would
definitely
buy
it
again
and
highly
recommend
you
try
it
all
in
all
harpoon
has
made
a
tasty
beer
the
alcohol
is
as
hidden
as
it
can
be
in
a
beer
of
this
strength
barley
wine
like
flavors
start
things
off
more
traditional
quad
flavors
start
to
pop
as
things
warm
up
this
quad
may
not
quite
measure
up
with
the
best
of
the
best
its
still
a
tasty
belgian
inspired
brew
the
aroma
has
notes
of
chocolate
which
mask
the
strong
abv
very
drinkable
for
this
style
of
beer
which
could
be
dangerous
in
the
long
run
d
low
it
tastes
good
but
can
take
a
while
to
drink
the
feel
of
this
beer
is
big
with
two
hands
there
is
nice
bold
flavors
and
big
feel
that
is
boozy
but
sweet
a
nice
heavy
beer
that
does
not
seem
too
big
let
me
start
by
saying
this
is
not
one
of
my
favorite
styles
poured
a
medium
to
deep
brownred
with
a
nice
2
finger
tan
head
adequate
lacing
went
downhill
from
here
smell
was
intense
booze
and
over
the
top
sweet
with
fruitsmalts
oranges
cloves
cointreau
taste
was
melted
carmel
with
carbonation
heavy
sugar
taste
almost
syrup
way
too
sweet
for
my
palate
felt
thick
and
heavy
on
the
tongue
almost
hot
does
not
hide
the
11
75
abv
very
well
letdown
by
the
sweetness
and
over
the
top
booze
would
not
track
this
down
for
a
2nd
try
overall
kind
of
disrespectful
to
the
style
this
is
so
amazingly
over
sweetened
with
little
depth
to
it
at
all
booze
soaked
fruits
are
dominant
and
completely
dominant
if
you
want
to
get
drunk
buy
this
beer
if
you
want
to
enjoy
a
beer
dont
overall
a
great
beer
to
have
on
a
cold
day
its
warming
and
pleasant
i
am
very
impressed
and
will
buy
again

this

warm
you
up

a
definite
sipper
quad
reminded
me
of
a
cross
between
a
unibroue
beer
and
samuel
adams
imperial
white
the
only
drawback
being
that
unlike
in
those
brews
harpoon
didnt
quite
manage
to
hide
the
strong
alcohol
flavor
as
well
leaving
a
bitterness
to
the
aftertaste
that
didnt
match
the
rest
of
the
mouthful
mouthfeel
is
indeed
velvety
as
noted
in
the
brewers
blurb
and
while
i
mostly
agree
that
this
is
a
superbly
drinkable
beer
i
would
also
caution
that
this
is
not
one
for
chugging
in
fact

beer
curiousmonkjan

but
only
a

better
than

due

the
massive
heat
i
really
feel
this
would
be
a
good
one
to
let
sit
for
a
couple
of
years
and
i
would
like
to
see
how
it
is
then
very
nice

though
and
i
feel
that
its
a
fair
representation
of

im
sensing
and
understanding
that
it
may
not
so
much
while
remaining
a

thinking
that
it
leans
too
heavily
to
some
barley

versions
may
not
be
such
a

thing
i
just
had
an
early
forum
on
this
lesson
for
me
still
it
is
a
sturdy
complex
and
nice
drink

only
if
you
dont

the
booze

dont

going
on
with
it
as
some

what
it
does
have
is
very
good
i
would
not

getting
more
of
this

some

the
