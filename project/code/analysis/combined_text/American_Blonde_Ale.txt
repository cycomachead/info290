mo
the
mouthfeel
remains
refreshing
and
softly
carbonated
against
a
moderate
flavour
profile
and
a
generally
solid
but
not
thick
body
overall
this
malty
brew
is
quite
different
to
all
other
rogues
ales
ive
had
so
far
due
to
its
emphasis
on
the
aromatic
maltiness
on
the
balance
very
well
made
although
id
prefer
if
a
bit
more
hops
were
applied
to
render
just
a
bit
more
bitterness
overall
esp
at
the
relatively
high
alc
content
based
on
a
simpler
flavour
profile
d
definately
a
spiced
beer
but
for
me
i
thought
this
was
great
it
really
suprised
me
becasue
i
was
not
expecting
it
and
normally
am
not
a
fan
of
such
beers
if
you
can
find
it
shark
tooth
or
whatever
i
think
it
is
worth
a
try
light
golden
in
color
with
a
medium
level
of
haze
and
cloudiness
to
it
that
obscured
a
bit
of
the
sunlight
poking
through
nice
head
of
white
capped
the
top
and
settled
down
smoothly
and
evenly
creating
a
decent
broken
crown
that
ringed
the
side
of
the
glass
and
kept
some
nice
lacing
aroma
was
light
and
this
would
be
a
trend
throughout
the
day
light
notes
of
peach
and
light
grain
are
really
all
that
is
coming
through
right
now
warming
brought
a
smidge
of
citrus
to
it
but
nothing
really
standing
out
here
for
me
at
all
crisp
clean
flavor
though
with
light
hints
of
clove
and
heather
that
sat
on
top
of
a
base
that
resembled
mostly
light
fruits
and
hints
of
grain
this
brew
wasnt
too
bad
it
pours
out
as
a
very
light
yellow
color
with
a
billowing
head
on
it
the
aroma
was
of
grains
and
some
light
citrus
the
taste
was
on
the
light
side
not
a
whole
lot
going
on
here
really
its
got
just
some
grains
up
front
and
a
little
bit
of
a
tart
hoppiness
in
the
aftertaste
i
wouldnt
need
to
have
this
beer
again
i
wasnt
really
impressed
d
perfect
drinkability
in
my
mind
nice
carbonation
and
a
soft
well
rounded
well
balanced
flavor
profile
overall
this
beer
tastes
like
a
hopped
up
belgian
white
decent
and
somewhat
drinkable
but
nothing
special
i
had
this
last
night
at
word
of
beer
in
carrolwood
labeled
as
shark
took
ale
this
beer
poured
a
deep
gold
with
no
head
and
little
lacing
the
aroma
is
a
yeasty
with
a
little
sweet
malt
this
is
a
malty
grainy
beer
with
lemon
and
a
hop
tail
a
medium
bodied
beer
although
i
felt
it
was
a
little
flat
but
decent
overall
i
dont
think
there
is
anything
wrong
with
brewing
a
spiced
golden
ale
but
this
is
way
overspiced
in
my
opinion
alot
going
on
here
with
the
ginger
being
refreshing
and
zesty
the
coriander
softens
things
a
little
bit
but
then
some
wheat
tang
comes
out
and
is
finished
off
by
an
ample
supply
of
grassy
floral
hop
flavor
and
plenty
of
bitterness
a
nice
progression
of
flavors
parade
across
the
palate
but
the
carbonation
might
be
a
bit
high
this
is
one
of
the
better
rogue
beers
i
have
had
a
nice
summertime
brew
still
a
bit
pricey
at
6
99
a
bomber
but
worth
a
try
every
now
and
again
d
i
could
drink
a
few
of
these
they
taste
good
and
go
down
easy
the
alcohol
content
also
seems
low
i
doubt
its
over
5
abv
the
bottle
i
have
is
called
shark
tooth
ale
and
has
a
shark
and
a
stingray
on
the
front
along
with
the
usual
rogue
spiel
about
the
brew
i
gotta
admit
im
a
big
fan
of
rogue
especially
the
way
they
tell
you
everything
about
the
brew
the
only
thing
that
they
leave
out
is
the
abv
anyways
onto
the
beer
it
pours
a
vibrant
golden
colour
with
nice
carbonation
that
leaves
a
one
finger
cloudy
sky
looking
head
and
a
nice
neat
rim
of
lacing
a
very
attractive
looking
brew
if
i
do
say
so
myselfthe
aroma
is
straight
out
corriander
mixed
with
gingerfreshly
cut
grass
and
a
little
paw
pawit
has
an
above
average
mouthfeel
which
is
nicely
carbonated
with
the
herbal
combination
of
ginger
corriander
first
to
the
hit
the
palette
which
is
followed
by
a
nice
hit
of
grassy
fruity
hops
to
beautifully
balance
out
the
tailend
of
this
brew
to
make
the
herbs
not
as
dominant
as
they
first
smell
and
i
wont
say
suprisingly
cos
it
is
rogue
but
this
beer
is
very
sessionable
especially
for
someone
who
doesnt
like
their
ginger
or
corriander
in
their
brews
and
think
if
you
closed
your
eyes
and
smelt
it
you
would
say
its
a
witbier
and
if
you
didnt
smell
it
and
just
drank
it
you
would
say
more
of
a
blonde
and
would
be
interested
to
see
how
it
tastes
with
less
or
different
herbs
or
even
none
at
allwill
buy
again
overall
another
nice
offering
from
rogue
the
steady
carbonation
is
nice
to
look
at
and
the
taste
is
nice
the
coriander
is
a
nice
surprise
addition
that
leaves
a
hint
of
unfiltered
wheat
beers
bottle
poured
clear
amber
with
a
huge
rocky
white
head
that
lasted
and
produced
good
lacing
heavy
hoppy
sweet
citrus
aroma
medium
body
with
a
slick
texture
and
soft
carbonation
moderate
sweet
citrus
flavor
with
a
light
bitter
finish
of
long
duration
this
was
pleasant
enough
but
was
a
little
off
the
beaten
track
for
rogue
simple
and
easy
drinker
tasty
enough
but
lacking
in
the
complexity
that
makes
some
of
these
beers
better
all
i
have
to
say
about
this
beer
is
that
it
was
the
first
rogue
beer
i
ha
tasted
i
prob
would
not
try
any
others
that
being
said
it
is
the
only
rogue
i
truly
did
not
like
at
all
now
i
will
put
gibberish
so
i
can
post
this
review
la
la
ha
ha
ho
ho
he
shared
a
bomber
between
the
two
of
us
and
i
actually
poured
out
the
last
quarter
of
my
glass
didnt
really
enjoy
it
much
1st
rogue
really
that
i
not
so
much
liked
22
oz
bottle
poured
a
golden
hay
color
with
very
little
head
this
beer
had
a
great
nose
to
it
but
the
taste
seemed
a
bit
well
flat
taste
wise
reminded
me
of
something
like
spiced
grass
the
initial
taste
was
good
the
after
taste
just
went
away
very
little
of
anything
here
but
the
spicyhoppy
taste
this
would
have
to
be
my
least
favorite
rogue
beer
that
ive
tried
further
proof
that
beer
needs
a
produced
on
date
pretty
nice
beer
carried
out
in
a
bomber
from
black
bear
burritos
review
edit
from
what
other
people
have
said
this
seems
like
it
might
not
completely
be
the
same
beer
but
what
do
i
know
the
smell
was
dry
and
of
yeasty
bread
the
taste
is
buttery
malt
and
dominated
by
that
malt
with
a
solid
bitter
finish
little
bit
of
sweetness
in
the
middle
it
is
a
wonderful
tasty
brew
i
would
like
to
see
more
of
this
in
bombers
this
has
more
to
it
than
any
blonde
i
have
had
ales
that
is
light
amber
colored
beer
with
a
slowly
fading
thick
head
aroma
is
buttery
bread
taste
is
toffee
and
bread
a
decent
beer
that
you
can
sit
back
and
drink
a
few
at
one
sitting
this
is
something
that
should
be
tried
at
least
once
and
something
that
i
would
purchase
again
overall
this
beers
best
qualities
are
its
drinkability
and
mouthfeel
its
fairly
crisp
and
stay
well
carbonated
not
too
expensive
or
high
in
alcohol
so
pretty
drinkable
i
may
buy
again
if
cheap
d
happy
to
drink
the
bottle
but
not
a
second
i
thought
that
american
blonde
was
a
sessionstyle
beer
not
too
heavy
in
any
dimension
this
one
seems
a
bit
sweet
for
mine
disappointing
especially
given
rogues
other
products
pours
clear
gold
with
sediment
and
no
head
aroma
is
all
pale
and
crystal
malt
taste
is
a
bitter
like
and
esb
but
without
the
body
or
pleasant
hop
balance
the
sweet
malt
and
cascade
hops
just
did
not
mix
well
did
not
enjoy
this
one
poured
a
golden
straw
color
with
a
1
finger
offwhite
head
on
it
very
bubbly
active
carbonation
smelled
grainy
little
hops
in
there
maybe
a
little
fruit
tasted
good
clean
crisp
little
hops
in
there
in
the
taste
also
light
to
medium
bodied
this
would
be
a
killer
session
beer
tastes
like
it
smells
crisp
and
smooth
and
perfectly
balanced
the
flavor
aint
all
that
strong
but
that
dont
matter
when
were
talking
about
a
beer
thats
this
smooth
and
this
wellbrewed
enough
to
keep
you
interested
i
could
drink
a
few
pours
a
hazy
dark
yellow
with
a
crisp
white
head
the
smell
is
a
nice
mix
of
malts
and
some
hops
with
a
bit
of
floral
citrus
the
taste
starts
with
some
malty
flavor
with
a
nice
balance
of
hops
and
a
slightly
bitter
finish
a
nice
balance
of
flavor
and
plenty
of
it
there
the
mouthfeel
is
good
not
as
smooth
as
i
expected
but
still
pleasing
this
is
an
easy
drinker
very
flavorful
but
not
overwhelming
definitely
worth
checking
out
a
great
blonde
beer
overall
a
very
easy
drinking
brew
the
mom
hefeweizen
claims
to
be
an
ale
brewed
with
coriander
and
ginger
mouthfeel
is
lightmedium
not
terrible
just
not
something
id
want
to
sit
around
and
drink
a
lot
d
definitely
drinkable
but
this
beer
is
going
to
be
very
difficult
for
me
to
get
in
texas
a
solid
choice
but
nothing
too
outstanding
copperorange
color
and
pours
with
a
nice
thick
head
good
amount
of
lacing
that
seems
to
last
until
the
end
slightly
malty
spicy
with
a
mild
bitter
hoppy
finish
easy
drinking
well
balanced
and
enjoyable
drinkability
im
conflicting
over
this
one
hate
the
smell
but
love
the
taste
id
grab
a
six
pack
of
this
just
to
shake
things
up
well
worth
trying
drinkability
average
taste
nothing
that
great
was
ok
the
taste
is
crisp
but
a
little
drier
than
i
expected
thats
a
good
thing
as
far
as
im
concerned
fairly
flavorful
for
such
a
light
ale
its
not
my
favorite
style
but
id
definitely
drink
it
again
on
a
hot
day
refreshing
not
bad
well
balanced
and
flavorful
with
an
easy
drinkibility
this
is
a
nice
thirst
quencher
pours
a
hazy
straw
gold
color
with
2
fingers
of
foamy
eggshell

average
retention
leaves
nice

smells
of
honey

orange
peel
coriander
lemon
juice
and
peppery
spicy
hops
medium
in
body
with
low
carbonation
sweet
and
spicy
with
a
nice
amount
of
hops
refreshing
zesty
and
easy
to
drink
its
clear
to
me
that
the
malt
is
ruling
this
american
blonde
ale
whether
by
design
or
by
an
unknown
amount
of
aging
whichever
the
reason
this
malt
dominant
medium
bodied
and
silky
smooth
ale
is
very
pleasing
and
easy
to
drink
and
at
the
ridiculous
price
i
bought
it
for
im
not
going
to
hesitate
in
buying
more
and
soon
before
they
take
them
off
the
shelf
i
had
a
similar
experience
with
rogues
brutal
bitter
what
a
year
or
2
ago
a
surprising
subtle
offering
from
rogue
and
its
nice
to
see
that
they
can
pull
something
like
this
off
clean
easy
simple
flavors
that
have
been
put
together
quite
nicely
id
get
this
again
d
easy
to
consume
but
is
limited
in
complexity
and
enjoyment
pretty
much
begins
to
get
boring
half
way
through
the
drink
nothing
that
really
stands
out
d
initial
impression
was
not
favorable
seemed
more
bitter
than
flavourful
but
it
grew
on
me
after
a
while
still
not
terribly
exciting
d
this
is
a
damn
good
session
beer
blonde
ale
i
dont
get
it
when
drinking
this
i
thought
that
it
was
a
nicely
hopped
esb
or
american
pa
whatever
it
is
its
good
certainly
not
rogues
best
offering
but
a
refreshing
kickback
type
of
brew
that
is
easily
drinkable
d
i
could
drink
many
of
these
in
a
sitting
definitely
a
friendly
and
inviting
ale
hops
are
nice
and
bright
in
the
mouth
balanced
perfectly
by
a
creamy
malt
profile
this
is
a
really
nice
sipper
pretty
drinkable
beer
doesnt
have
a
huge
complexity
to
it
but
it
surprised
me
i
liked
it
more
than
i
thought
i
would
a
strong
pour
gets
a
two
finger
light
tan
head
with
a
rocky
fat
bubbley
head
body
is
an
attractive
orange
brownish
murky
amber
nose
is
a
nice
mix
of
creamy
wheat
and
soft
fresh
hops
with
notes
of
soapy
minerals
enters
the
mouth
creamy
smooth
with
rich
and
slightly
bitter
wheat
feel
coating
the
mouth
a
thick
mouthfeel
is
created
by
the
malty
backbone
and
bitter
bite
but
it
is
nicely
filling
and
quite
full
this
is
a
very
even
drinking
nicely
balanced
beer
would
be
a
nice
summer
beer
very
sesionable
pours
a
dark
but
clear
amber
nose
is
bitter
with
a
touch
of
citrus
if
you
really
dig
for
something
different
on
the
nose
flavor
is
doughy
and
definitely
pretty
bitter
but
in
a
controlled
and
smooth
type
of
way
definite
dough
on
there
on
both
sides
feel
is
thick
on
the
liquid
and
kind
of
feels
a
bit
too
much
so
i
think
bubble
is
nice
overall
very
drinkable
i
found
it
went
down
very
smoothly
and
was
definitely
nice
holds
up
well
for
a
blonde
ale
the
hopping
is
remarkably
restrained
for
rogue
and
well
balanced
drinkability
other
than
the
nose
this
is
a
pretty
solid
beer
that
i
really
enjoyed
glad
i
could
contribute
a
few
bucks
to
the
oregon
aquarium
the
beer
is
very
golden
in
color
but
i
noticed
it
produce
virtually
no
head
i
held
the
glass
up
to
a
light
and
was
surprised
to
find
the
beer
was
cloudy
my
nose
could
not
detect
any
foul
aromas
that
would
indicate
spoilage
so
i
took
a
taste
the
beer
was
very
smooth
and
lacked
in
the
carbonation
arena
the
flavor
hints
of
sweetness
and
hops
with
a
very
mild
bite
in
the
finish
fairly
drinkable
for
a
style
i
dont
go
wild
about
this
would
be
alright
for
a
pint
or
3
not
bad
im
really
happy
i
got
to
try
this
and
even
more
happy
that
i
have
such
a
nice
day
to
enjoy
it
on
bottle
courtesy
of
okbeer
poured
a
deep
golden
color
ale
with
a
nice
medium
foamy
head
with
some
quite
good
retention
and
some
really
good
lacing
aroma
of
cascade
hops
is
providing
some
floral
notes
as
well
as
some
medium
bitterness
taste
is
mostly
dominated
by
the
mix
of
hops
and
i
thought
was
lacing
some
malt
characteristics
body
is
not
as
full
as
i
would
have
expected
with
some
great
carbonation
i
personally
think
that
this
beer
could
have
been
more
rewarding
with
a
bigger
malt
profile
pours
a
very
nice
amber
with
a
big
two
finger
head
that
leaves
great
lacing
smell
is
sweet
breads
and
yeast
taste
is
yeasty
with
an
earthy
hop
biterness
that
comes
through
to
finish
mouthfeel
is
moderate
very
drinkable
and
would
be
a
decent
session
candidate
overall
ok
but
nothing
special
easy
to
drink
my
day
for
session
beers
pours
a
dense
amberorange
color
with
a
fat
twofinger
head
which
sticks
around
for
a
while
and
leaves
a
healthy
lace
as
the
beer
drinks
down
the
aroma
is
a
musty
malt
smell
reminiscent
in
my
opinion
of
the
oskar
blues
dales
pale
ale
nice
enough
but
nothing
spectacular
and
seriously
if
theyre
going
to
try
to
package
this
as
a
bitter
then
at
least
put
give
us
a
hoppy
aroma
the
taste
is
nice
a
bit
sweet
up
front
with
some
hints
of
cut
grass
and
strawberries
mostly
malt
flavors
i
get
a
little
bit
of
the
hoppy
bitterness
in
the
finish
but
i
would
hardly
call
this
beer
a
bitter
what
a
misnomer
the
mouthfeel
is
thin
but
not
too
weak
overall
id
call
this
a
proper
session
beer
and
i
could
see
having
it
again
sometime
but
the
labeling
is
weird
as
this
is
not
what
i
would
call
a
bitter
i
know
rogue
cranks
out
a
lot
of
brews
too
many
but
theres
no
need
to
repackage
something
and
give
it
a
different
name
if
its
really
something
else
just
my
personal
opinion
with
all
that
said
this
just
isnt
very
interesting
i
wouldnt
buy
this
again
but
id
take
a
free
pint
of
it
any
day
nothing
wrong
with
it
just
kind
of
boring
really
poured
a
slightly
hazy
pale
orange
a
lot
of
carbonation
and
a
sturdy
finegrained
head
grainy
toffee
aroma
with
a
bit
of
honey
as
well
very
pleasant
taste
is
a
bit
scratchy
with
co2
on
the
tongue
but
then
a
yeasty
fullness
nicely
balanced
with
bitterness
a
pleasing
ale
not
an
overthetop
brew
but
good
for
the
style
smooth
and
flavorful
enough
to
keep
it
interesting
easydrinking
here
pours
a
slightly
hazy
goldenorange
with
an
offwhite
head
that
builds
quickly
and
aggressively
large
bubbled
but
still
substantial
before
dissipating
back
to
just
a
thin
layer
over
the
surface
of
the
beer
leaves
moderate
lacing
smell
is
malty
first
and
foremost
bread
and
yeasts
taking
the
lead
with
mild
spiciness
and
a
hint
of
light
fruits
as
well
hops
are
noticeable
just
a
light
citrus
aroma
floating
in
the
background
taste
is
very
well
balanced
leaning
to
the
malty
side
but
with
an
obvious
hop
presence
as
well
bread
lightly
toasted
is
the
first
impression
with
butter
and
sweetness
as
well
orange
and
spices
in
the
mix
too
with
a
light
herbal
hop
finish
that
is
drier
but
doesnt
overwhelm
the
rich
malt
profile
in
the
finish
mouthfeel
is
full
and
rich
very
well
carbonated
and
drinkability
is
very
good
nice
brew
light
on
the
hops
but
with
a
distinctive
niche
all
its
own
in
the
rogue
lineup
drinkability
is
average
i
didnt
like
this
beer
i
think
maybe
it
was
a
little
old
or
went
bad
somewhere
along
its
life
ill
definitely
have
to
try
this
again
in
oregon
golden
ale
form
if
i
come
across
it
cheers
a
nice
summer
beer
pours
a
dark
yellow
with
a
medium
head
that
went
away
pretty
quick
the
smell
is
definately
some
hops
with
a
noticable
alcohol
a
but
of
a
hard
cider
smell
to
it
the
taste
is
pretty
good
floral
hops
pretty
balanced
carbonation
ending
in
some
light
bitterness
the
mouthfeel
is
pretty
light
with
a
but
of
carbonation
but
not
too
much
drinkability
is
not
too
bad
but
since
i
found
it
to
be
pretty
average
either
way
i
would
say
if
you
were
at
a
bar
that
offered
a
great
selection
of
beers
you
would
probably
want
to
move
on
to
something
else
after
a
glass
or
two
at
least
i
would
overall
not
a
bad
beer
at
all
alot
better
then
many
common
beers
out
there
but
not
one
of
my
faves
overall
i
would
say
pretty
unoffensive
pours
out
a
cloudy
orange
color
the
medium
head
disappears
after
a
short
while
shows
aromas
of
malt
and
some
grassiness
to
go
with
a
noteable
breadyyeasty
presence
flavors
of
citrus
a
bit
of
floral
hoppiness
with
a
slight
caramel
presence
a
definite
bit
of
sweetness
to
the
palate
very
drinkable
but
nothing
to
make
one
stand
up
and
go
wow
beer
pours
up
with
a
nice
all
white
head
that
lasts
and
lasts
very
good
retention
a
tawny
straw
color
with
some
strawberry
highlights
on
the
edges
vigorous
carbonation
rises
to
the
surface
here
you
can
see
it
billowing
through
the
crystal
clear
liquid
the
smell
is
malty
but
drier
than
i
had
expected
ultimately
a
bit
hoppy
on
the
nose
the
taste
of
this
one
disappoints
sweet
fruity
malts
up
front
and
some
grainy
smooth
tones
are
nice
in
the
middle
but
aside
from
some
dry
cheekiness
in
the
finish
there
isnt
any
thing
not
much
finish
at
all
the
mouthfeel
compounds
this
very
light
and
too
watery
the
carponation
all
escapes
with
the
head
leaving
no
bite
in
the
drink
itself
overall
drinkability
is
quaffable
but
not
all
that
great
i
dont
want
another
one
this
beer
pours
a
dark
orange
amber
color
with
a
fizzy
medium
head
that
disappears
very
quickly
the
smell
is
very
strong
with
malt
bread
yeast
floral
and
earthy
spices
the
smell
is
surprisingly
strong
for
a
lighter
beer
the
taste
is
a
creamy
mixture
of
sweet
malt
bitter
hops
and
a
bisquity
flavor
the
mf
is
light
and
the
flavors
mix
very
well
this
is
a
damn
good
beer
except
for
the
ginger
ale
like
carbonation
cheers
nice
silkscreened
bottle
with
a
lot
of
japanese
characters
on
the
back
of
which
i
cannot
translate
a
word
this
made
for
an
excellent
beach
beer
goes
down
very
well
nice
round
glyceral
mouthfeel
and
a
very
easy
drinker
d
aside
from
what
i
view
to
be
an
oversweetness
for
the
style
this
is
a
decent
beer
unfortunately
when
there
are
so
many
other
great
beers
in
rogues
stable
it
becomes
apparent
why
this
one
was
retired
very
drinkable
and
a
nice
example
of
the
style
typical
rogue
bomber
sharktooth
ale
the
etched
on
label
tells
us
that
part
of
the
proceeds
of
this
one
goes
to
support
a
local
aquarium
nice
tasty
beer
for
a
good
cause
pours
almond
amber
with
a
typical
off
white
semi
loose
head
dissolving
to
a
spotty
film
and
leaving
minor
lacing
soft
malty
nose
this
is
a
fairly
light
balanced
ie
low
hopping
rates
for
rogue
refreshing
and
drinkable
brew
bready
malts
notes
of
pound
cake
and
perhaps
a
hint
of
minty
spice
drinkable
and
pleasant
good
middle
of
the
road
craft
brew
a
great
all
around
drinkable
beer
if
this
were
around
i
would
buy
it
sure
i
prefer
the
youngers
a
smidge
but
niether
of
these
are
found
in
nj
right
now
a
really
nice
bitter
i
enjoyed
it
hazy
gold
topped
with
thick
white
head
good
retention
keeping
a
thick
collar
speckles
of
lace
malty
aroma
pale
malt
with
a
generous
flloral
hop
backing
kinda
dusty
and
yeasty
with
a
doughy
presence
fairly
clean
otherwise
the
flavor
start
with
crackly
grainy
pale
malt
wheat
lighter
medium
bodied
with
softer
carbonation
pretty
smooth
aided
by
the
yeast
pour
notes
of
straw
and
dried
grass
a
hint
of
apple
movinf
directly
into
modestly
hoppy
finish
floral
and
a
touch
citric
with
restrained
bitterness
not
a
lot
going
on
here
but
its
easy
drinking
and
tasty
nothing
id
go
out
of
my
way
for
again
nut
its
nice
to
try
it
once
exactly
like
their
oregon
golden
ale
why
does
rogue
rename
their
beers
like
this
nevertheless
it
goes
great
with
my
udon
noodles
not
too
substantial
compliments
the
meal
and
easy
drinking
i
guess
that
would
make
it
good
beer
wouldnt
it
pours
a
hazy
golden
orange
with
an
ok
head
that
faded
quickly
nose
is
somewhat
bready
and
sweet
taste
starts
with
a
bready
sweet
malt
and
is
finishes
with
a
nice
drysweet
hop
mouthfeel
is
fuller
than
your
average
blonde
ale
drinkability
is
good
the
abv
i
would
guess
to
be
between
5
to
6
this
brew
has
grown
on
me
as
i
have
progressed
thru
the
bomber
worth
a
try
especially
if
you
are
more
inclined
to
stick
with
lighter
colored
ales
somewhat
hazy
gold
color
tightly
formed
offwhite
head
very
faint
smell
of
yeast
dusty
malt
typical
rogue
flavor
of
munich
malt
combined
with
the
unique
pacman
yeast
light
cascade
hop
character
tagged
on
as
well
if
i
didnt
know
better
id
think
this
was
a
cream
ale
its
extremely
creamy
smooth
a
surprisingly
hearty
ale
from
rogue
wellbalanced
easy
to
drink
and
one
worth
trying
shark
tooth
ale
version
poured
out
to
a
hazed
golden
orange
with
a
nice
thick
1
inch
head
minor
notes
of
lace
aromas
of
citrus
fruits
and
yeast
are
most
present
with
afterthoughts
of
herbs
and
earth
taste
is
well
crafted
and
enjoyable
flavors
of
malts
citrus
bitter
hops
and
some
grain
to
add
depth
mouthfeel
was
light
and
medium
bodied
yet
still
had
a
touch
of
texture
which
was
nice
overall
drinkability
is
fair
this
isnt
a
bad
brew
by
any
means
but
it
lacks
depth
and
inspiration
nothing
fantastic
but
a
solid
example
of
the
style
worth
a
try
mouth
feel
is
light
bodied
and
carbonated
generously
and
assertive
mineral
flavor
comes
through
immediately
followed
by
bready
malt
and
hop
flavor
buttery
flavors
linger
bitterness
is
minimal
but
seems
to
sneak
into
the
aftertaste
solid
bitter
here
however
a
bit
too
metallic
for
my
taste
the
beer
pours
a
hazy
burnt
orange
color
with
a
12
offwhite
head
that
fades
to
lacing
the
aroma
is
good
it
has
a
semisweet
malty
scent
that
boasts
of
pale
light
crystal
and
bisquit
malts
along
with
a
mild
hop
bitterness
the
taste
is
good
it
has
a
smooth
malty
flavor
that
goes
down
easy
and
finishes
toastey
and
bitter
the
hop
bitterness
lingers
on
the
tongue
the
mouthfeel
is
fine
it
is
a
medium
bodied
beer
with
adequate
carbonation
this
is
a
pretty
good
englishstyle
bitter
it
has
tremendous
flavor
and
a
fine
aroma
its
not
as
dry
as
some
bitters
which
sets
it
apart
this
would
make
a
good
sessions
brew
well
it
says
shark
tooth
ale
on
the
bottle
but
i
guess
this
is
the
same
beer
anyway
pours
a
nice
light
amber
color
slightly
orange
murky
with
a
smallish
white
head
smell
is
hard
to
pick
out
but
is
full
of
pale
malts
and
lightly
spicy
hops
tasted
is
much
the
same
mostly
a
pale
malty
grainy
beer
but
a
decent
amount
of
spicy
herbal
hops
add
a
bit
of
peppery
zest
tastes
like
a
more
malty
version
of
their
uber
pils
which
i
like
better
nice
smooth
texture
but
a
little
sluggish
it
seems
like
this
beer
is
trying
to
be
something
it
isnt
maybe
its
trying
to
be
a
lager
or
pilsner
but
doesnt
quite
have
the
crispness
anyway
its
a
decent
brew
but
with
the
lineup
of
rogue
beers
theres
no
reason
why
youd
want
to
pick
this
out
of
the
bunch
itll
work
in
a
pinch
though
pours
an
orange
opaque
hazy
color
with
a
moderate
and
quickly
falling
head
the
aroma
on
this
brew
is
remarkable
breadlike
malt
butter
bubblegum
esters
yeast
malt
and
hops
theres
a
lot
going
on
in
there
theres
a
lot
of
flavors
that
come
out
in
the
taste
as
wellcitrus
and
caramel
and
a
lot
of
sweetness
hops
get
turned
up
in
the
hindtaste
and
balance
the
whole
affair
very
nicely
its
pretty
highlycarbonated
and
of
medium
body
slightly
slick
on
the
tongue
resiny
notably
acidic
hops
poke
out
into
the
flavor
from
time
to
time
but
arent
nearly
as
assertive
as
a
lot
of
west
coast
brews
complex
but
the
flavors
seem
somewhat
haphazard
and
dont
always
mesh
together
in
a
seamless
manner
still
i
thoroughly
enjoyed
this
one
its
not
a
masterpiece
but
i
have
few
complaints
id
have
a
few
more
of
these
if
i
had
them
on
hand
drinkability
probably
the
most
hoppy
blonde
ale
i
have
ever
come
across
but
seein
that
it
is
rogue
i
should
have
expected
it
overall
tasty
and
very
drinkable
got
this
in
a
22
oz
sharktooth
ale
bomber
pours
a
dull
copper
with
a
very
scant
head
that
vanished
almost
immediately
a
small
amount
of
lacing
as
i
drink
nose
is
yeasty
bread
with
a
dose
of
juicy
citric
hops
taste
has
the
same
yeasty
breadlike
character
with
a
fair
amount
of
butterscotch
coming
through
and
a
citric
small
hop
bite
as
i
make
my
way
through
the
beer
and
it
warms
the
hops
become
more
assertive
like
i
expect
from
rogue
as
far
as
mouthfeel
goes
this
really
killed
the
beer
for
me
as
it
was
way
undercarbonatedfelt
like
an
esb
also
a
little
on
the
thin
side
reading
other
reviews
it
seems
like
my
undercarbonation
might
have
been
a
fluke
so
ill
give
it
another
chance
but
as
it
is
this
is
my
first
disappointment
from
rogue
starts
off
with
a
good
dose
of
malt
some
caramel
and
then
hops
that
are
juicy
then
fade
into
bitterdry
i
wonder
if
these
were
the
same
hops
they
use
in
the
brutal
bitter
moderate
mouthfeel
with
just
enough
body
and
carb
tingle
great
session
brew
the
only
good
beer
available
at
the
4th
bbq
this
past
weekend
a
nice
hazy
orange
tone
with
a
thin
foamy
white
head
that
laced
well
lots
of
yeast
bread
some
hop
nice
citrus
and
some
acidity
on
the
nose
good
citrus
and
yeast
on
the
tongue
nice
thick
feeling
good
carbonation
a
slightly
bitter
aftertaste
and
something
that
is
good
a
few
times
but
not
on
a
regular
basis
a
bit
too
aggressive
for
what
im
used
to
in
summer
beer
this
had
rogues
rather
filling
and
potent
stock
taste
and
approach
coupled
with
a
laidback
golden
element
i
can
best
describe
as
slightly
metallic
and
a
little
caramel
in
flavour
and
going
easy
on
the
hops
it
slid
down
rather
easily
and
seemed
pretty
strong
if
it
were
cheaper
i
could
see
myself
drinking
a
lot
of
it
im
not
sure
its
worth
4
50
a
pint
though
rogue
could
make
this
bigger
and
better
hoppy
aroma
hoppy
initially
satisfaction
then
rather
plain
and
lighter
mouthfeel
fine
and
drinkable
for
a
late
summer
afternoon
dinner
medium
golden
colour
citrus
notes
otherwise
not
that
much
taste
here
well
carbonated
dry
and
malty
finish
competent
but
nothing
special
drinkabiltyvery
good
this
beer
is
fun
to
drink
i
wish
i
had
more
overall
a
decent
enough
ale
but
really
nothing
more
than
just
above
average
a
little
more
hops
and
malt
wouldnt
go
amiss
and
would
improve
this
offering
no
end
this
one
strikes
as
a
summer
bbq
companion
this
beer
is
not
really
a
apa
this
thing
is
a
frankenstein
half
british
and
half
american
either
way
it
is
very
good
the
beer
pours
a
dark
murky
yeast
golden
color
and
has
a
fat
white
head
that
sticks
around
like
rocky
in
a
big
fight
it
smells
very
much
like
a
fine
british
pale
ale
i
should
almost
give
it
a
5
here
but
considering
that
it
is
supposed
to
smell
like
an
apa
it
is
lacking
the
cascade
aromas
other
than
the
initial
floral
bite
the
cascades
are
destroyed
by
the
kent
goldings
and
the
heavy
malt
profile
provided
by
the
munich
malt
i
just
read
on
their
website
that
this
is
a
2001
limited
edition
bottling
can
this
be
so
if
it
is
4
years
old
then
this
beer
holds
up
really
well
if
not
then
they
need
to
update
their
website
pours
a
deep
gold
almost
amber
color
with
a
good
2
finger
head
and
nice
lace
smells
of
a
slightly
roasted
malt
with
some
slight
caramel
and
toffee
note
somewhat
subtle
hop
floral
aroma
but
it
is
nice
the
immediate
first
taste
is
overwhelmingly
that
of
a
slightly
roasted
malt
but
it
quickly
fades
into
a
very
nice
hop
flavor
and
bitterness
butterscotch
caramel
and
toffee
flavors
are
everywhere
very
much
like
an
apa
but
much
more
malty
very
nice
and
highly
drinkable
a
great
session
beer
pours
a
pale
gold
with
a
thick
fluffy
bone
white
head
very
inviting
good
balance
of
hops
and
malt
on
the
nose
malt
is
a
bit
more
noticable
but
not
too
sweet
good
malty
backbone
on
the
palate
hops
join
in
for
a
pleasant
mildly
spicy
and
dry
finish
similar
finish
to
some
other
rogue
offerings
light
mouthfeel
but
quite
flavorful
a
very
drinkable
beer
i
really
enjoyed
this
worth
a
try
anytime
good
session
beer
for
me
beer
is
good
happy
beering
hazy
gold
in
hue
with
a
tawny
infusion
the

retention
was
average
as
it
slipped
quickly
to
a
fizzy
cap
this
cap
lasted
awhile
though
subsequent
lacing
was
spotty
and
it
clung
poorly
aside
from
the
vast
haziness
of
the
liquid
there
isnt
anything
notable
about
the
appearance
the
nose
lacks
that
typical
rogue
aroma
damn
shame
i
guess
it
is
cool
to
be
different
fruity
apricots
mainly
hints
of
mushy
apples
upfront
before
the
nose
turns
malty
in
the
middle
with
a
buttery
undercurrent
light
kisses
of
spice
from
the
hops
i
assume
this
is
the
most
muddled
bouquet
ive
ever
encountered
from
rogue
the
potency
is
on
the
low
side
of
moderate
i
do
like
what
i
smell
it
is
inviting
but
not
very
articulate
the
palate
is
pretty
damn
dull
im
surprised
im
disappointed
i
like
the
spicy
zip
in
the
middle
and
the
buttermalty
mess
at
the
end
but
the
beginning
is
empty
it
is
earthy
and
juicy
throughout
there
is
an
small
array
of
fruits
like
apricots
and
citrus
zest
weak
toasty
malts
soft
sweetness
this
beer
needs
food
i
think
it
would
work
well
at
a
bbq
on
a
hot
summer
day
assuming
the
food
it
tangy
sweet
this
beer
is
very
tame
this
beer
cant
be
from
rogue
right
i
mean
the
palate
is
just
above
average
the
aftertaste
is
citrusy
and
sweet
with
a
kiss
of
butter
messy
again
it
needs
food
almost
medium
in
body
the
carbonation
is
low
but
natural
and
it
seems
to
work
well
with
the
disheveled
flavor
profile
this
is
a
lazy
beer
overall
this
beer
is
okay
and
thus
drinkable
to
a
point
but
what
is
the
point
there
are
too
many
great
beers
on
the
market
that
are
in
the
same
realm
as
this
one
i
might
try
this
beer
again
but
i
wont
go
out
of
my
way
to
do
so
i
purchased
a
12ounce
bottle
in
west
des
moines
for
2
00
average
stuff
another
fine
rogue
brew
poured
a
cloudy
light
caramel
color
2
of
head
when
poured
and
simmered
down
to
thin
covering
layer
spotty
lacing
when
down
the
sides
of
my
22oz
pilsner
glass
has
a
sweet
malty
beginning
that
develops
into
a
hoppy
finish
not
sure
if
this
is
really
a
pale
ale
but
i
would
consider
this
an
above
average
brew
but
nothing
special
going
on
here
would
be
a
good
staple
beer
if
available
here
in
socal
gotta
love
the
rogue
didnt
like
this
beer
as
much
as
the
seahorse
i
feel
compelled
to
compare
them
as
they
are
part
of
a
benefit
series
and
is
far
less
drinkable
ive
read
that
this
one
is
simply
the
oregon
golden
or
was
in
the
past
however
the
specs
seem
to
be
slightly
different
on
this
newer
version
whatever
minor
changes
were
made
were
for
the
good
methinks
it
pours
a
nice
copperorange
colour
with
a
big
fluffy
head
that
leaves
a
nice
amount
of
residue
on
the
glass
the
nose
is
sweet
but
hoppier
than
i
can
recall
the
oregon
golden
being
theres
a
nice
biscuit
base
as
well
which
mixes
nicely
with
the
citrus
notes
the
flavour
is
fairly
close
to
the
smell
with
perhaps
more
floral
notes
than
citrus
but
overall
pretty
much
the
same
the
finish
is
hoppy
and
sweet
and
quite
nice
here
this
is
as
basic
a
rogue
brew
as
your
gonna
find
as
far
as
i
can
tellhave
experienced
with
them
thusfar
still
its
very
tasty
and
has
a
nice
hop
kick
to
it
thats
not
overpowering
by
any
means
a
nice
session
brew
appearance
bright
shimmering

i
guess
they
hit
their
mark
oregon
golden

a
nice
full
white
head
leaves
behind
a
decent
thicket
of

cant
beat
it
light

malts
great
sweetness
flowery
hop
profile
comes
out
to
the
dominate
williamette
variety
thrown
in
here
not
bad
at
all
taste
once
again
the
flowery
hops
hit
my
seneses
with
a
clean
sweet
cereal
grain
of
a
hop
profiel
did
i
mention
that
i
love
rogue
beers
and
their
signature
pac

yeast
has
something
to
do
with
it
mouthfeel

wonderful

of
a

goes

excellent

around

you
dont
come
by
much
remarkable
examples
of
this
style
this
is
one
comments
i
was
surprised
by
the
lack
of
hop
bite
especially
coming
from
rogue
all
in
all
an
average
beer
for
me
but
one
that
i
will
visit
with
again
poured
a
dull
and
slightly
hazy
golden
orange
a
small
and
creamy
white
head
topped
the
beer
off
the
aroma
has
sweet
creamy
malts
with
a
sweet
citrus
hop
character
the
taste
is
clean
and
simple
well
balanced
with
a
interesting
tanginess
bitterness
is
dead
on
and
finishes
crisp
nice
body
of
malt
this
is
a
simple
and
flavorful
golden
ale
very
nice
poured
into
an
imperial
pint
glass
formed
a
1
offwhite
head
above
the
lightly
amber
golden
brew
head
shows
some
staying
power
and
lacing
is
good
aroma
is
crisp
and
clean
hops
with
some
light
malts
beefing
things
up
underneath
taste
is
surprising
sweet
of
pale
malts
upfront
with
medium
bitterness
dominating
the
rest
of
the
experience
mouthfeel
and
drinkability
are
both
excellent
not
as
overthetop
hoppy
as
many
apas
and
thats
fine
with
me
give
it
a
try
you
wont
be
sorry
drinkability
highly
quaffable
this
one
is
by
legend
one
of
the
original
rogue
ales
from
their
early
days
it
still
has
some
character
of
a
microbrew
from
two
decades
ago
which
adds
to
its
charm
not
as
refined
as
most
of
the
modern
rogue
line
but
a
solid
very
drinkable
ale
that
has
a
nice
northwest
hops
character
for
a
blonde
ale
aaah
yeah
very
drinkable
i
thought
the
hops
in
this
beer
were
going
to
over
power
each
sip
but
was
plesantly
surprised
by
the
ever
present
malt
taste
in
the
background
this
isnt
a
hop
monster
and
is
not
overly
bitter
a
great
beer
i
could
almost
drink
this
stuff
all
day
until
i
got
tired
of
the
super
bitter
aftertaste
the
aroma
was
of
faint
fruity
esters
and
a
cereal
like
toastiness
the
flavor
is
perfect
as
the
initial
bitterness
has
a
very
pleasent
taste
without
being
rough
or
earthy
at
all
the
clean
maltiness
is
the
main
flavor
of
this
ale
with
a
complex
flavor
that
hints
at
munich
malt
flavors
blended
with
dryer
pilsner
malt
flavors
the
body
is
nice
for
an
ale
and
the
carbonation
is
smooth
with
no
carbonic
bite
very
drinkable
this
would
make
an
excellent
session
beer
as
well
as
an
excellent
beer
to
give
to
macro
drinkers
as
an
eye
opener
pours
a
deep
orange
slightly
brown
color
reminiscent
of
apple
cider
not
too
much
head
after
a
conservative
pour
but
what
is
there
is
pure
white
and
sticky
smells
of
spicy
hops
and
carmel
malt
taste
is
more
subtle
than
i
expected
but
it
is
still
good
a
lot
of
malt
for
a
pa
still
enough
hops
to
sate
me
overall
and
above
average
beer
medium
bodied
to
the
light
side
excellent
session
beer
one
i
wouldnt
mind
being
stuck
on
a
desert
island
with
i
was
a
little
surprised
not
to
have
seen
this
beer
reviewed
even
more
surprised
when
i
couldnt
find
record
of
it
on
rogues
website
ive
found
it
to
be
comprehensive
in
the
past
it
has
a
hazy
copper
color
with
a
light
head
and
no
lace
to
speak
of
a
floral
character
with
just
a
hint
of
citrus
lime
from
the
hops
comes
across
in
the
nose
the
taste
is
all
hops
with
the
floral
character
balanced
by
hints
of
grass
and
citrus
a
hint
of
malt
to
balance
the
flavor
no
real
alcohol
bite
which
is
good
it
has
a
decent
medium
mouth
feel
very
drinkable
i
may
have
to
go
back
to
martys
for
another
bomber
quaffing
during
grilling
season
slight
appeared
a
slightly
hazy
golden
color
with
a
tall
frothy
head
of
foam
nice
pieces
of
lace
decorated
the
glass
as
this
one
was
consumed
the
aroma
was
mild
but
pleasant
with
roasted
grain
like
a
cereal
smell
and
a
bit
sweet
with
caramel
malt
the
taste
was
very
similar
in
that
the
caramel
and
cereal
grain
flavors
were
the
dominating
components
a
bit
of
a
bitter
after
taste
rounded
this
out
for
a
refreshing
tasting
beverage
mouthfeel
was
nothing
special
with
about
a
medium
body
and
sufficient
carbonation
this
is
a
very
sessionable
beer
that
i
would
have
again
but
overall
its
not
too
exciting
a
brew
youre
typical
solid
rogue
creation
22
ounce
bottle
a
very
nice
drinking
beer
overall
a
nice
experience
sweet
and
mild
this
makes
a
lovely
session
beer
i
thought
this
beer
was
japanese
but
it
really
a
rogue
beer
brewed
for
the
japanese
market
the
beer
was
a
dark
gold
colour
with
a
good
head
it
was
fairly
bitter
but
finished
with
a
sweetish
finish
it
tasted
a
lot
like
an
esb
and
i
will
say
that
this
is
very
drinkable
one
of
rogues
session
beers
well
a
solid
if
not
great
pale
ale
this
was
one
i
hadnt
seen
before
we
went
to
kclingers
so
we
decided
to
pick
it
up
and
give
it
a
try
a
good
hop
balance
but
not
quite
a
classic
still
if
i
saw
it
around
again
might
give
it
a
try
rogue
bottles
this
same
beer
under
the
name
shark
tooth
ale
with
proceeds
benefiting
the
oregon
coast
aquarium
very
drinkable
brew
not
too
sweet
and
not
a
ridiculously
high
level
of
hops
or
alcohol
sampled
3604
drinkable
and
enjoyable
perfect
for
a
nice
day
as
i
drank
it
after
a
few
hours
of
mountainbiking
this
beer
is
a
dark
golden
color
hazy
body
nice
sized
foam
head
cream
colored
light
malts
and
hops
in
the
nose
this
brew
is
surprisingly
or
not
so
much
if
you
know
rogue
hoppy
light
malts
creamy
mouthfeel
pretty
bitter
for
this
style
but
this
is
a
nice
beer
wish
it
had
a
slightly
bigger
malt
profile
i
wasnt
sure
what
to
expect
from
this
less
well
known
rogue
offering
but
what
i
expected
wasnt
what
i
got
i
mean
that
in
a
good
way
oregon
golden
ale
is
more
flavorful
and
bigger
of
body
than
i
would
have
guessed
another
good
one
from
a
brewery
that
almost
never
disappoints
tastes
unique
like
a
cross
between
a
good
pale
ale
with
a
little
citrus
hop
flavor
and
the
biscuit
malt
of
an
esb
tasty
brew
i
could
probably
drink
a
bunch
of
it
this
is
a
very
smooth
brew
you
can
taste
the
maltiness
of
the
brew
but
it
balanced
nicely
with
the
hops
while
this
is
not
as
hoppy
as
many
of
the
other
rogue
brews
this
is
a
nice
change
and
could
very
well
be
a
great
session
this
week
ill
be
trying
to
review
rogue
brews
as
ive
found
quite
a
bit
in
my
local
beverage
mart
this
past
week
i
was
looking
forward
to
reviewing
this
brew
because
of
the
mixed
reviews
the
bottle
was
slighty
dusted
and
that
got
me
a
little
worried
but
i
didnt
need
to
be
worried
i
popped
the
cap
and
a
huge
head
developed
out
of
the
bottle
poured
out
a
nice
golden
color
with
a
nice
decent
enough
head
on
it
aroma
of
malts
citrus
notes
and
some
hops
blend
in
as
well
almost
like
an
ipa
taste
was
quite
interesting
hops
attack
quickly
and
last
all
the
way
through
even
through
the
aftertaste
but
like
most
rogue
beers
the
hops
seem
controlled
some
citric
notes
and
malts
mix
in
towards
the
middle
and
end
and
some
hints
of
lemon
almost
like
carbonated
tea
in
a
way
im
glad
i
review
this
beer
because
it
is
quite
interesting
but
i
will
say
that
its
a
decent
enough
beer
to
get
a
recommendation
seek
it
out
and
try
it
its
different
and
i
think
its
good
not
your
typical
rogue
brew
because
its
just
pretty
average
light
golden
color
with
a
nose
of
lemon
and
a
twang
of
hops
flavor
is
bready
and
dry
but
the
hops
come
through
to
balance
things
out
nicely
well
balanced
though
i
would
say
i
could
ask
for
a
little
more
of
everything
to
give
it
some
more
character
and
flavor
i
certainly
would
not
mind
drinking
a
few
of
these
though
a
nice
brew
but
just
average
for
rogue
this
is
the
third
rogue
offering
ive
had
dead
guy
mocha
porter
and
this
isnt
quite
as
good
as
the
others
but
also
not
objectionable
hazy
golden
orange
color
with
active
carbonation
that
feeds
a
slight
and
shortlived
foamy
offwhite
head
sweet
malty
grain
smell
dominates
the
nose
which
is
complemented
by
a
buttery
smoothness
the
hops
that
are
lacking
in
the
smell
are
present
in
the
reasonably
balanced
taste
sweet
malts
give
way
to
a
bit
of
spice
and
a
bitterness
in
the
aftertaste
that
lasts
a
really
long
time
mouthfeel
is
smooth
but
also
crisp
this
is
the
most
likable
beer
ive
tried
yet
in
a
style
that
i
generally
dont
care
for
had
the
pour
the
rest
out
maybe
i
just
wasnt
in
the
mood
but
this
was
a
disappointment
pours
a
light
orange
yellow
honey
color
with
relatively
small
head
which
leaves
a
little
lace
the
smell
is
relatively
simple
with
some
earthy
malts
and
a
bit
of
hops
present
has
a
small
bit
of
earthy
chocolate
smell
as
if
from
a
stout
the
taste
is
earthy
as
well
with
a
strange
starchy
flavor
not
offensive
just
curious
that
tastes
somewhat
like
a
raw
potato
it
has
a
slightly
off
metalic
flavor
to
it
as
well
which
masks
the
hoppiness
the
mouthfeel
is
dry
and
smooth
with
bubbles
that
tingle
on
the
back
of
the
roof
of
the
mouth
an
alright
brew
although
it
has
a
bit
of
a
strange
flavor
i
poured
it
straight
out
of
the
characteristic
screened
bomber
into
a
pint
glass
very
little
cascading
and
it
settled
to
a
mostly
clear
middling
to
dark
amber
with
just
a
bit
of
a
white
foam
the
smell
is
enticing
subtle
hops
lightly
filtered
by
sweet
citrus
cedar
and
caramel
suggesting
a
solid
malt
backbone
the
mouth
feel
is
thin
to
medium
accentuated
by
some
uptempo
carbonation
and
there
is
an
underlying
buttery
smoothness
the
taste
is
rather
fine
the
ale
opens
with
a
tartness
dulls
a
bit
in
the
middle
act
but
finishes
strong
with
a
balance
of
bitters
and
hops
note
i
liked
this
beer
but
it
is
not
a
blonde
or
golden
ale
hence
the
low
score
i
guess
rogue
is
ashamed
to
make
anything
that
could
be
considered
lightweight
but
so
what
but
fully
coating
mouthfeel
with
a
tingly
carbonation
but
nothing
above
and
beyond
spectacular
charthepiratejan

so
as
i
said
the
appearance
was
of
a
straw
golden
color
with
some
head
and
very
little
lace
the
aroma
with
of
hops
and
a
floralspicey
nature
when
i
tasted
it
id
like
to
try
it

youll
have
this

tasty
and
very

though
not
a
beer
to
be
sipped
and
savored
this
doesnt
seem
to
be
a
red
ale
to
me
definitely
the
lightest
bodied
and
flavored
rogue
ive
tried
a
grainy
nose
taste
has
some
sweet
graininess
up
front
but
then
a
real
dry
hop
bite
emerges
i
like
it
refreshing
easy
to
drink
thirst
quenching
a
nice
every
day
ale
from
rogue
not
terribly
complex
but
still
enjoyable
the
beer
was
extremely
smooth
with
very
mild
carbonation
it
was
very
light
but
it
had
enough
body
to
keep
it
as
a
good
ale
there
is
a
very
nice
citrus
flavoring
combined
with
the
malts
to
start
you
off
the
malts
dominate
while
you
also
get
zaps
of
hops
and
maybe
a
little
bit
of
yeast
here
and
there
this
is
a
very
interesting
ale
from
rogue
perhaps
im
just
drinking
this
at
the
wrong
time
of
year
what
seems
thin
in
december
might
be
refreshing
in
august
but
for
now
this
rogue
seems
a
little
subpar
pours
a
nice
hazy
golden
orange
with
a
decent
white
head
and
some
nice
yeasties
floating
around
nice
citrus
and
piney
hop
aromas
dominate
in
this
brew
with
the
faintest
of
biscuity
malt
in
the
background
smooth
malty
qualities
provide
the
backbone
of
this
brew
from
start
to
finish
some
nice
biting
hoppiness
towards
the
beginning
of
the
brew
with
definite
piney
qualities
to
it
the
brew
finishes
with
a
nice
biscuity
maltiness
that
leaves
you
yearning
for
more
very
nice
creaminess
that
combines
with
the
hop
bite
to
make
this
brew
rather
crisp
and
very
refreshing
nice
medium
body
to
this
on
this
would
make
a
superb
session
brew
as
i
could
drink
one
after
another
of
these
a
lightly
hazed
copper
color
the
head
mammoth
but
is
does
seem
to
settle
a
bit
quickly
the
lace
is
in
thin
sheets
to
coat
the
glass
nose
is
mostly
malt
light
citrus
tones
begins
malt
and
somewhat
sweet
the
top
is
unsubstantial
the
finish
insignificantly
hopped
slightly
dry
and
middling
in
acidity
drinkable
and
pleasant
enough
hazy
yellowbrown
color
with
a
large
offwhite
head
lots
of
tiny
bubbles
constantly
rise
good
lace
aroma
is
dominated
by
sweet
malts
and
perhaps
a
slight
mustiness
taste
begins
with
wellbalanced
malts
neither
too
sweet
nor
too
grainy
followed
mild
bitter
grapefruit
flavors
from
the
hops
finishes
with
a
slight
sweet
note
and
bread
flavors
mouthfeel
is
very
smooth
quite
a
bit
better
than
usually
seen
in
this
style
would
make
a
nice
warm
weather
beer
heres
another
solid
offering
from
rogue
this
golden
ale
actually
pours
to
a
deep
honey
color
with
a
pretty
durable
head
the
smell
is
as
is
characteristic
of
rogue
hoppy
with
some
solid
malt
lingering
beneath
the
taste
is
of
hops
honey
and
some
tasty
malt
the
mouthfeel
is
very
smooth
and
creamy
making
this
a
pretty
easy
drinking
beer
this
has
to
be
one
of
the
better
blondegolden
ales
produced
in
the
us
rogue
in
general
is
a
welcomed
label
and
i
will
gladly
consume
many
more
of
these
watching
the
summer
storms
roll
in
pours
out
a
slightly
hazy
copper
colour
with
a
nice
thick
pillowy
head
that
laces
down
the
glass
rogue
hop
aroma
some
spiciness
and
sugary
sweet
maltiness
solid
malt
backbone
a
little
light
on
the
hops
for
a
rogue
but
very
drinkable
a
soft
buttery
undertone
delivers
the
deliciousness
slightly
english
in
feel
mouthfeel
is
on
the
lighter
side
a
nice
summer
ale
but
a
bit
lacking
in
all
the
things
that
make
rogue
so
delectable
for
a
blonde
ale
not
bad
within
the
style
one
could
easily
put
down
multiple
bombers
of
this
stuff
mostly
average
but
worth
a
try
okay
this
beer
poured
a
light
amber
color
with
a
off
white
head
which
left
some
lace
the
aroma
held
elements
of
hops
and
malt
in
it
the
taste
also
held
elements
of
hops
and
malt
the
finish
was
lighter
and
not
what
i
usually
expect
from
this
style
not
as
good
a
some
of
their
others
but
still
a
good
beer
ive
had
smaller
apas
than
this
golden
ale
deepstraw
gold
pushing
light
amber
with
a
decent
lace
considering
the
fact
that
many
brewers
make
a
golden
ale
for
the
swill
drinking
masses
i
give
a
nod
to
rogue
for
a
tastier
gold
malty
and
slightly
fruity
with
a
mild
citrus
hop
finish
this
ale
works
well
as
summer
brew
refreshing
when
cold
but
tastier
as
the
sun
warms
the
brew
and
the
brew
warms
you
notes
tame
on
the
hops
for
a
typical
rogue
brew
yet
still
holds
its
own
with
a
bigger
than
average
malty
body
better
than
decent
and
enjoyable
to
say
the
least
i
had
an
odd
experience
with
this
beer
i
popped
the
cap
and
the
head
wouldnt
stop
coming
out
of
the
bottle
i
was
going
to
just
take
this
one
out
of
the
bottle
but
i
ended
up
pouring
it
anyway
to
keep
from
having
to
clean
up
a
mess
from
the
everincreasing
head
even
after
poured
it
took
a
bit
for
it
to
stop
increasing
good
beer
though
not
much
special
but
id
very
likely
buy
it
again
beautiful
golden
with
slight
chill
haze
clinging
thin
white
foamy
head
strawlike
yeasty
character
with
definate
mild
herbal
hop
and
sweet
malt
aroma
in
the
nose
buttery
with
thick
malt
and
a
mildly
grassy
strong
citrusy
hop
bitterness
throughout
very
clean
strawlike
yeasty
taste
very
onesided
no
true
blending
or
complexity
thick
mouthfeel
for
a
golden
ale
not
very
impressive
in
my
opinion
this
pours
a
semihazy
straw
yellow
color
with
a
slight
white
head
the
aroma
is
grassygrainy
the
flavor
is
wellbalanced
for
the
style
with
the
prefect
texture
there
is
a
decent
amount
of
earthy
organic
flavors
it
finishes
with
a
lingering
grassy
grain
flavor
interesting
and
yet
quite
simple
good
crisp
flavor
a
little
dry
hop
pines
with
a
great
flavor
and
finish
051612
too
bitter
for
my
taste
not
as
cloying
as
most
so
perhaps
the
hopheads
might
like
it
this
beer
is
super
drinkable
a
nice
beer
to
have
on
hot
summer
day
like
today
not
very
interesting
but
thats
probably
the
idea
with
a
smash
like
this
if
i
could
find
this
for
2
00
again
id
buy
it
i
had
this
on
draft
at
mellow
mushroom
while
waiting
patiently
for
the
mrs
it
poured
a
hazy
golden
color
i
didnt
realize
it
was
a
blonde
ale
given
then
name
when
i
ordered
it
so
that
came
as
a
bit
of
a
surprise
the
taste
was
floral
almost
under
yeast
and
malts
and
was
actually
quite
nice
there
was
decent
lacing
on
the
glass
but
not
a
ton
of
staying
power
good
stuff
this
one
was
on
the
discount
table
no
date
pours
a
cloudy
bright
yellow
with
an
offwhite
slightly
tan
foamy
head
the
head
sticks
around
12
an
inch
for
the
duration
the
lacing
is
ok
little
dry
spots
of
popped
bubbles
like
sea
foam
on
the
beach
the
smell
is
fairly
onedimensional
nothing
objectionable
nothing
outofthisworld
sour
grain
some
citrusvinegar
its
a
cleantasting
dry
beer
if
this
werent
the
coldest
night
in
november
in
alabama
but
rather
oh
july
then
this
would
be
an
amazingly
refreshing
ale
sharp
metallic
hoppiness
grapefruit
rind
basil
lavender
this
one
doesnt
leave
you
parched
and
the
carbonations
just
about
right
theres
a
bit
of
density
to
it
that
is
welcome
as
its
not
watery
or
thin
a
good
go
at
it
the
smell
is
simple
yet
delightful
a
plain
mix
of
light
malts
and
pine
hop
flavor
that
may
not
be
intriguing
but
it
certainly
is
pleasing
the
taste
leads
with
light
biscuit
flavors
followed
by
yeast
cleaned
up
with
a
touch
of
hop
bitterness
if
this
is
what
i
expected
when
i
saw
a
blonde
on
the
menu
at
a
new
establishment
i
would
order
the
style
much
more
frequently
appearance
has
a
slightly
hazy
golden
straw
color
supporting
a
nice
steady
head
leaving
a
nice
curtain
of
lace
smell
has
a
nice
floral
hop
aroma
over
the
dare
malt
taste
having
a
bold
but
not
overassertive
bitterness
blending
well
with
the
sweetness
of
the
malt
mouthfeel
is
medium
with
good
carbonation
an
easy
drinking
pnw
ale
o
i
enjoyed
this
beer
very
much
i
wish
the
flavors
balanced
themselves
out
a
little
more
however
overall
it
was
not
a
bad
finish
to
the
flavors
i
would
drink
this
beer
again
would
not
be
the
first
thing
i
purchase
however
should
i
be
in
the
specific
mood
for
a
beer
with
a
solid
bite
this
it
is
a
commercial
smash
brew
poured
into
a
shaker
from
the
bottle
pours
a
fairly
hazy
golden
straw
color
with
thick
rocky
head
on
top
there
is
tons
of
good
lacing
to
the
glass
the
nose
is
nice
and
simple
and
revolves
around
some
fresh
bread
light
yeast
smell
and
very
lemony
hop
smell
to
the
nose
the
taste
is
a
nice
flow
from
the
nose
there
is
good
sweet
malt
up
front
with
an
oily
lemon
zing
to
it
the
malt
and
the
hops
play
nicely
together
the
mouthfeel
was
a
little
thin
but
finished
nice
and
dry
overall
i
think
this
a
good
beer
something
i
am
doing
in
my
own
homebrews
i
think
the
only
detriment
comes
from
the
haziness
on
the
appearance
and
the
thin
mouthfeel
it
was
a
good
beer
and
a
good
concept
rouge
single
malt
ale
pours
an
almost
hazy
golden
color
with
a
small
but
lacing
head
there
is
a
sweet
crisp
malty
aroma
with
just
a
hint
of
hop
the
taste
is
the
same
way
good
balanced
mellow
malty
flavors
with
just
a
hint
of
hops
mixed
in
good
full
bodied
flavor
overall
this
is
a
slightly
hoppy
blonde
ale
with
full
flavors
very
enjoyable
for
this
style
hazy
pale
blonde
one
finger
of
white
head
with
pretty
good
retention
as
well
as
a
fair
bit
of
lace
smell
is
full
of
lemony
citrus
hops
followed
by
cereal
malts
more
hop
and
a
bit
of
earthiness
not
overly
complex
but
a
nice
mixture
of
light
citrus
and
malts
taste
follows
the
nose
lemony
citrus
up
front
bready
malts
follow
hoppy
and
lightly
bitter
throughout
citrus
aftertaste
high
carbonation
medium
body
though
watery
at
points
and
a
bit
thin
this
was
pretty
enjoyable
although
simple
not
a
whole
lot
going
on
here
to
make
this
a
great
beer
but
certainly
something
that
i
could
drink
a
few
glasses
of
throughout
the
day
oquite
liked
this
one
simple
an
refreshing
would
love
to
kick
back
on
a
porch
in
the
summer
with
a
bottle
of
this
and
a
steak
probably
not
the
best
beer
for
the
winter
season
but
i
knew
that
going
in
i
would
buy
this
again
i
do
really
like
the
simplistic
approach
to
this
beer
most
of
todays
craft
brews
seem
to
have
6
kinds
of
malt
6
kinds
of
hops
aged
in
this
blessed
by
that
etc
this
actually
reminds
me
alot
of
the
first
home
brew
i
ever
made
come
to
think
of
it
a
very
easy
drinking
beer
simple
in
its
flavors
but
i
think
it
does
what
it
intended
to
do
showcase
the
freshness
of
the
ingredients
and
the
essence
of
beer
itself
im
really
looking
forward
to
trying
other
selections
from
the
chatoe
and
as
others
have
said
i
always
respect
the
process
of
rogue
growing
their
own
barley
malt
and
hops
it
adds
authenticity
to
this
selection
try
it
pours
a
murky
orange
with
a
foamy
bone
colored
head
that
settles
to
a
film
on
top
of
the
beer
small
dots
of
lace
form
around
the
glass
on
the
drink
down
smell
is
of
malt
fruits
and
yeast
taste
is
much
the
same
with
a
mild
hop
bitterness
on
the
palate
with
each
sip
this
beer
has
a
lower
level
of
carbonation
with
a
slightly
crisp
and
medium
bodied
mouthfeel
overall
this
is
a
pretty
good
beer
but
its
pretty
basic
for
the
style
overall
this
beer
is
very
refreshing
and
is
overall
enjoyable
it
has
all
the
elements
youre
looking
for
maltiness
hoppiness
bitterness
however
the
mouthfeel
is
soooo
light
and
the
bitterness
so
mellow
that
it
lacks
the
profoundness
necessary
to
raise
it
to
the
next
level
tasty
hop
flavor
though
light
i
would
definitely
appreciate
this
beer
on
a
hot
day
or
when
i
need
a
good
swig
of
something
refreshing
but
it
is
not
a
real
standout
overall
i
really
dig
this
beer
for
the
concept
of
grow
your
own
gyo
for
that
alone
i
give
an
overall
score
of
5
having
just
homebrewed
a
wet
hopped
beer
a
few
weeks
ago
i
really
admire
what
rogue
did
with
this
one
i
think
a
tad
bit
more
hop
character
would
help
in
the
aroma
nose
profile
but
im
rogue
is
attempting
to
showcase
the
malts
not
the
hops
in
this
finely
crafted
ale
minor
carbonation
medium
viscosity
and
overall
a
decent
brew
to
have
a
couple
of
or
more
since
i
heard
rogue
was
brewing
strains
of
yeast
from
the
master
brewers
beard
ive
been
a
little
hesitant
about
all
their
beers
i
mean
can
you
imagine
the
more
common
areas
they
might
have
already
chosen
for
their
previous
beers
yeah
you
know
o
tasty
goes
down
easily
not
too
filling
mild
kick
good
representation
of
style
this
is
a
solid
beer
to
drink
for
a
while
really
good
table
beer
i
dont
have
a
lot
to
say
about
this
beer
because
this
beer
doesnt
have
a
lot
to
say
about
itself
single
malt
is
that
interesting
certainly
not
this
one
yuck
im
not
drinking
this
one
i
gave
it
several
healthy
swallows
and
im
throwing
in
the
towel
down
the
drain
it
goes
a
huge
disappointment
o
nothing
really
stood
out
about
this
beer
that
would
make
me
want
to
try
it
again
but
it
could
be
something
suited
for
a
hot
summer
day
pick
up
a
bottle
hopefully
it
isnt
priced
too
high
unfortunately
most
rogue
beers
are
pretty
expensive
in
new
jersey
an
interesting
brew
thats
an
easy
quaffer
and
has
some
good
taste
to
it
i
like
it
probably
more
than
most
o
not
quite
as
sessionable
as
it
should
be
at
5
3
abv
but
worth
a
try
if
you
spot
it
the
best
amen
o
a
cool
idea
and
a
nice
drinking
beer
theres
not
too
much
that
jumps
out
at
me
in
the
beer
but
i
do
love
the
idea
that
it
is
from
their
hops
and
their
malt
keep
it
up
guys
pours
an
attractive
if
typical
clear
amber
with
a
very
thick
fluffy
and
rather
persistent
white
head
aroma
is
malty
yeasty
and
a
little
fruity
and
not
particularly
strong
malty
flavor
has
a
bitter
slightly
tinny
overtone
and
a
hint
of
fruit
texture
is
smooth
and
has
average
body
but
not
much
fizz
not
one
of
rogues
better
efforts
but
still
palatable
picked
this
up
at
the
local
bottle
shop
for
30
off
the
appearance
is
a
light
cloudy
gold
in
color
with
a
thick
white
head
the
smell
is
a
nice
fresh
hop
aroma
slight
spiciness
the
flavor
continues
in
that
vein
but
adds
a
subtle
sweetness
and
the
spice
now
tastes
more
like
a
pepperrye
the
mouthfeel
is
fine
if
slightly
cloying
overall
a
nice
blonde
ale
and
certainly
one
of
the
better
blonds
i
have
had
drinkability
probably
pretty
good
with
an
intact
bottle
i
cant
totally
bottom
out
the
score
im
still
nipping
at
the
beer
as
i
type
maybe
got
a
third
of
it
down
but
i
am
always
disappointed
with
infected
bottles
as
i
cant
always
find
another
sample
easily
ill
keep
my
eyes
open
for
this
one
though
and
give
it
another
shot
o
a
very
good
blond
ale
nice
hop
flavor
in
this
beer
d
a
cool
idea
probably
not
worth
the
price
its
a
tasty
brew
but
not
great
for
the
price
sorry
rogue
this
one
isnt
doin
it
for
me
nice
not
must
have
this
particular
one
is
overall
refreshing
balanced
and
enjoyable
however
nothing
really
stands
out
its
about
average
to
slightly
above
average
for
the
category
overall
this
beer
is
a
really
easy
drinker
i
like
the
simplicity
of
it
and
really
like
the
crisp
finish
smell
was
light
with
the
biggest
hints
coming
from
grain
and
a
nice
bread
tone
slightly
sour
tones
present
as
well
maybe
some
sour
grape
or
apple
nice
play
on
the
palate
and
a
decent
hoppy
aftertaste
biggest
flavors
were
by
far
malts
and
grains
d
decent
cheers
o
good
flavor
and
balance
i
hope
future
brews
of
this
ale
come
out
even
better
as
the
recipe
improves
i
love
the
concept
behind
this
beer
and
imagine
this
could
be
nice
and
refreshing
on
a
hot
summer
day
but
its
not
really
hitting
the
spot
on
the
october
evening
not
too
bad
of
a
beer
the
hops
really
take
over
this
beer
it
is
good
as
a
lighter
beer
that
lets
the
hops
do
the
talking
but
i
could
imagine
a
few
of
these
would
be
enough
overall
a
well
made
and
well
balanced
beer
that
really
doesnt
try
to
do
too
much
its
clean
its
refreshing
its
got
a
very
pleasant
though
not
complex
hop
profile
that
takes
center
stage
up
until
the
finish
at
which
point
their
dare
malts
shine
additionally
the
beer
has
a
great
value
i
only
paid
6
well
worth
the
price
and
a
nice
refreshing
brew
o
this
is
not
a
terrible
effort
but
it
is
not
one
of
rogues
finest
offerings
either
in
the
end
this
is
a
pleasant
enough
beer
but
nothing
about
it
is
all
that
remarkable
o
lack
of
interesting
nose
and
the
poor
taste
make
this
a
loser
no
reason
to
try
again
appearance
is
a
light
orange
tone
with
a
one
finger
white
head
the
nose
has
grains
toasted
malts
as
well
as
floral
hops
its
taste
is
a
mix
of
more
of
the
malts
hops
biscuit
and
faint
sweetness
mouthfeel
is
light
to
medium
with
a
very
smooth
finish
this
is
a
great
beer
for
a
warm
day
in
the
late
summer
or
early
fall
a
really
good
drinker
its
almost
like
they
made
the
brutal
bitter
a
lite
beer
i
like
it
overall
this
is
a
drinkable
refreshing
beer
but
nothing
extraordinary
o
this
is
a
perfect
summer
beer
in
my
opinion
very
refreshing
and
light
not
overpowering
at
all
i
think
this
would
be
a
nice
beer
to
go
along
with
a
pizza
an
okay
beer
but
it
lacks
finesse
and
complexity
ok
nice
hop
bite
but
thats
about
it
lightly
hazy
straw
yellow
with
about
a
fingers
worth
of
bubbly
white
head
head
disappears
down
to
nothing
but
tiny
swirls
grainy
an
extremely
pale
malt
grassy
flowers
flavor
is
crisp
and
carbonated
biscuit
malts
which
are
very
pale
but
on
the
caramel
lightly
toasted
side
hops
character
is
huge
with
floral
grassy
hops
starting
to
creep
in
right
after
the
first
couple
seconds
some
fruity
hop
notes
start
the
finish
but
it
becomes
grassy
and
overly
dry
at
first
the
finish
had
great
flavor
changes
but
finishes
off
too
dry
i
love
the
theory
and
i
cannot
say
i
even
understand
how
difficult
it
would
be
to
produce
a
consistent
product
with
self
grown
materials
let
alone
a
first
run
with
first
growth
products
i
love
the
idea
i
dont
love
the
beer
o
while
this
beer
wont
win
a
whole
lot
of
prizes
for
complexity
it
is
likable
and
easy
to
drink
bright
amber
body
on
the
lighter
side
of
the
spectrum
caramel
and
floral
hops
in
the
aroma
the
flavor
is
pretty
one
dimensional
a
weak
nutty
roasted
malt
flavor
and
a
bit
tart
hopped
to
the
point
of
decent
balance
but
theres
not
a
whole
lot
there
the
typical
sour
pacman
yeast
rogue
insists
on
using
is
here
at
work
bland
eh
maybe
the
barley
needs
a
year
or
two
to
get
firmly
rooted
before
the
flavor
comes
in
strong
my
response
to
this
beer
is
unreservedly
positive
and
i
have
to
think
that
some
reviewers
are
allowing
their
negative
feelings
for
rogue
to
cloud
their
palates
i
shared
a
22oz
with
friends
and
the
response
was
overwhelmingly
positive
among
a
wide
range
of
beer
appreciation
from
hopheads
and
homebrewers
to
miller
lite
treats
me
just
fine
i
hope
they
continue
something
like
this
d
pretty
drinkable
overall
it
is
an
interesting
beer
i
spied
with
my
little
eye
a
good
bit
of
sediment
so
my
pour
was
as
gentle
as
it
would
be
for
my
baby
dolls
skin
color
was
a
deep
orangishamber
bupgoo
no
head
thanks
to
the
gentle
pour
nose
smelled
oddly
familiar
it
was
the
characteristic
rogue
hop
strain
underlain
by
the
malty
sweetness
wow
i
have
noticed
this
in
their
beers
before
a
certain
commonality
but
to
have
it
appear
in
a
homegrown
form
is
just
impressive
it
had
a
very
bready
toasty
malt
flavor
initially
on
the
tongue
but
also
an
earthy
grassy
saaz
hops
flavor
underneath
finish
was
very
dry
just
the
way
i
prefer
my
beers
best
blonde
ive
had
in
a
while
d
this
is
a
pretty
nice
blonde
ale
i
like
the
concept
the
taste
is
quite
good
exceptional
balance
is
noted
right
away
notes
of
lively
citrus
toffee
and
pleasant
floral
hop
bitterness
are
present
nothing
extraordinary
yet
very
very
drinkable
and
friendly
excellent
thirstquencher
and
thirst
inducer
calls
for
savory
accompaniments
such
as
grilled
meats
or
hotsmoked
fish
ill
have
another
one
anytime
really
poured
from
a
22
bomber
straight
into
a
perfect
pint
glass
the
was
an
uruption
of
carbonation
once
i
popped
it
openso
i
lost
some
of
it
it
poured
a
hazy
golden
color
with
plenty
carbonation
the
taste
was
vey
smooth
with
a
solid
hop
kick
it
had
a
very
earthy
mouthfeel
and
plenty
of
residue
was
left
on
the
empty
glass
overall
a
quality
brew
solid
beer
not
stellar
but
solid
d
this
is
strange
the
carbonation
is
way
too
high
the
floral
aromas
are
overbearing
and
it
tastes
like
im
licking
a
bayer
aspirin
anywho
this
beer
exemplifies
those
ideas
and
unfortunately
i
think
most
of
the
reviewers
are
probably
just
drinking
it
way
too
cold
you
should
really
be
approaching
this
as
if
it
were
an
english
bitter
60ish
degrees
fahrenheit
if
this
were
ever
served
on
cask
itd
be
a
showstopper
for
sure
best
new
beer
ive
tried
in
recent
memory
pours
a
light
clear
straw
yellow
with
a
fluffy
white
head
the
aroma
is
sharp
sprightly
and
bitter
with
straw
and
slight
lemon
the
flavor
is
primarily
bitter
with
a
sharp
pine
sting
the
flavor
has
a
light
pilsner
character
with
a
lemony
edge
and
some
pine
the
mouthfeel
is
prickly
as
silly
as
it
seems
to
say
i
think
this
one
would
be
made
great
by
honey
pours
a
slightly
hazy
amber
color
with
two
finger
of
head
that
fade
slowly
with
thick
lacing
grainy
malt
and
piney
hops
combine
in
the
aroma
the
body
is
much
thinner
than
i
was
expecting
and
along
with
a
strong
slightly
harsh
bitterness
is
the
dominate
characteristics
of
this
beer
the
bitterness
is
sharp
and
earthy
with
just
the
slightest
hint
of
malt
sweetness
the
finish
is
lingering
with
an
unpleasant
bitterness
not
a
great
beer
the
single
malt
bill
doesnt
have
what
it
takes
to
balance
the
hop
profile
and
really
holds
this
beer
back
i
have
to
admit
that
their
gyo
idea
really
appeals
to
me
the
beer
is
a
rich
amber
color
with
a
touch
of
haze
modest
white
head
the
most
notable
thing
about
the
beer
is
the
intense
malt
aroma
its
wonderfully
complex
and
appealing
the
taste
is
moderately
sweet
with
a
maltcentric
trait
medium
in
body
the
beer
is
not
as
heavy
as
expected
on
the
low
side
in
carbonation
the
concept
is
fantastic
and
the
beer
is
solidly
good
just
not
great
gyo
indeed
inspirational
poured
into
an
imperial
pint
glass
color
was
a
nice
golden
amber
with
small
streams
of
carbonation
rising
from
the
bottom
head
was
a
solid
3
fingers
off
white
froath
that
lasted
a
few
minutes
but
then
left
a
nice
head
akin
to
whip
on
a
mocha
aroma
was
mildly
hoppy
small
amount
of
kick
but
not
overwhleming
malty
did
come
through
a
bit
as
well
taste
was
a
sharp
hop
not
bitter
different
than
i
normally
expect
for
something
classified
as
a
blonde
felt
good
in
the
mouth
a
strange
mix
of
textures
but
yet
still
coated
well
with
enough
to
it
to
be
interesting
seemed
to
me
to
be
one
to
savor
definitely
not
something
to
slam
this
is
the
kind
of
beer
id
like
to
have
a
six
pack
of
in
place
of
a
fizzy
yellow
lager
a
fairly
simple
beer
in
some
respects
but
this
is
actually
a
very
nice
drinking
pale
ale
i
almost
wish
it
was
a
bit
bigger
so
that
i
could
better
zero
in
on
the
daretm
malt
and
the
revolution
hops
i
could
see
myself
enjoying
quite
a
few
pints
of
this
brew
my
biggest
gripe
is
that
it
is
a
bit
overcarbonated
but
luckily
a
few
swirls
of
my
glass
can
get
rid
of
the
excess
carbonation
drinkability
while
it
can
be
assumed
that
a
singlemalt
ale
is
intended
to
be
consistent
in
its
attributes
it
is
definitely
recognizable
and
pleasant
to
drink
as
such
it
has
everything
it
needs
taste
is
lightly
sweet
to
start
lemony
in
the
middle
with
a
saazlike
crisp
hoppy
close
that
lingers
mouthfeel
is
quite
smooth
and
drinkability
is
very
nice
as
well
good
brew
and
admirable
concept
d
tastes
very
fresh
and
very
rogue
estimating
the
abv
at
somewhere
round
5
i
think
this
bomber
is
da
bomb
d
through
the
roof
homey
flavorful
and
modest
i
dig
the
organic
nature
this
isnt
strong
flavored
but
it
is
very
pleasant
there
is
a
slight
bitterness
at
the
end
appears
a
pale
slightly
hazed
bright
orange
golden
hue
with
a
thicket
of
off
white
cream
head
billows
above
the
edge
of
my
new
dfh
curved
pint
glass
aroma
is
simple
yet
very
nice
a
touch
of
light
lemon
citrus
hops
and
pale
biscuit
malts
with
a
nice
air
of
fruitiness
flavor
has
an
assertive
herbalcitric
rind
bitterness
from
the
hops
and
a
pleasant
malt
tones
coming
through
way
more
interesting
than
your
average
blonde
ale
this
is
a
single
malted
ale
that
gives
of
nice
biscuitfruit
malt
character
that
really
makes
the
beer
along
with
grow
your
own
revolution
hops
kickin
in
to
balance
things
out
way
more
hops
than
your
average
beer
very
well
balanced
excellence
mouthfeel
is
medium
bodied
never
thin
or
boring
on
the
palate
carbonation
is
perfect
goes
down
very
easy
drinkability
overall
is
solid
a
nice
big
bottle
of
gyo
from
rogue
i
will
drink
whatever
offerings
come
out
of
this
series
while
the
whole
growyourown
rogue
venture
is
an
interesting
concept
this
resulting
beer
is
a
bit
lackluster
moderate
malt
with
pleasant
grain
and
some
honey
sweetness
not
that
everything
this
brewery
makes
has
to
be
over
the
top
but
here
the
level
of
restraint
makes
for
a
rather
onedimensional
and
unengaging
beer
d
a
refreshing
beer
with
some
interesting
characteristics
but
overall
kind
of
simple
andwhile
very
drinkableleaves
something
wanting
the
beer
pours
a
hazy
gold
color
with
a
thick
frothy
white
head
that
slowly
fades
to
lacing
the
aroma
is
decent
it
has
a
light
pale
malt
scent
along
with
a
powerful
hop
aroma
its
bitter
as
hell
and
totally
dominates
the
nose
the
taste
is
decent
as
well
it
has
a
solid
pale
malt
flavor
with
a
very
bitter
hop
taste
its
light
and
quaffable
an
enjoyable
blonde
the
mouthfeel
is
fine
it
is
a
low
bodied
beer
with
adequate
carbonation
this
is
a
good
drinking
blonde
ale
its
simple
in
composition
yet
flavorful
and
sessionable
d
great
beer
for
the
fourth
of
july
or
any
other
summer
day
not
too
heavy
on
the
alcohol
or
body
so
you
can
have
quite
a
few
great
light
offering
from
rogue
and
with
everything
being
homegrown
how
can
you
go
wrong
chatoe
rogues
first
growth
single
malt
ale
delivers
on
a
few
points
grow
your
own
ingredients
and
emphasizing
quality
over
concept
in
terms
of
style
single
malt
ale
is
about
as
good
as
one
thing
can
be
without
getting
into
the
hazy
realm
of
high
concept
beers
if
more
ales
had
this
sort
of
quality
id
be
a
much
happier
camper
if
all
you
want
is
hoppy
malty
refreshment
try
this
beer
out
maybe
im
off
base
but
this
beer
probably
shouldnt
be
rated
as
an
american
blonde
even
if
thats
what
its
supposed
to
be
t
great
concept
but
fails
to
deliver
anything
to
get
excited
by
better
beers
at
the
same
price
from
both
rogue
other
breweries
means
i
wont
be
buying
this
again
of
the
three
chatoe
rogue
first
growth
brews
that
ive
reviewed
so
far
dirtoir
black
lager
is
clearly
the
best
next
is
wet
hop
ale
bringing
up
the
rear
is
single
malt
ale
a
relatively
lackluster
offering
from
a
brewery
that
is
capable
of
much
much
better
it
seems
that
the
rogue
lineup
the
pacman
yeast
affect
is
taking
on
a
very
strong
englishlike
taste
aroma
and
body
these
make
for
good
beers
but
this
brewery
is
known
for
their
advancements
of
american
style
west
coast
ales
very
contradictory
as
an
example
of
an
integrated
agricultural
product
highlighting
both
a
particular
regions
raw
ingredients
and
approach
to
brewing
its
a
very
cool
opening
salvo
in
the
chatoe
series
d
a
totally
drinkable
beer
if
you
neglect
the
price
that
id
quickly
recommend
to
any
hophating
friends
they
do
exist
unfortunately
sigh
bottle
poured
an
amber
color
ale
with
a
medium
foamy
head
with
average
retention
and
minimal
lacing
aroma
of
caramel
malt
is
nice
enough
with
some
piney
hops
with
light
citrus
undertones
taste
is
also
a
nice
enough
mix
between
caramel
malt
with
a
light
bitter
finish
with
medium
piney
notes
and
some
citrus
as
well
body
is
about
average
with
good
carbonation
not
bad
with
good
drinkability
factor
easy
enough
to
drink
and
goes
down
well
on
a
hot
day
but
not
my
favorite
maybe
i
got
one
out
of

how
the

v
thanks
presario
refreshing
for
summer
i
will
keep
buying
these
brews
because
as
a
homebrewer
they
are
doing
some
of
the
work
for
me
by
doing
experiments
like
these
however
at
7
per
bottle
i
could
make
5
gallons
of
similar
brew
for
the
price
of
5
or
6
bottles
mouthfeel
is
light
bodied
which
i
think
i
really
think
it
could
use
more
malt
character
a
little
more
malt
sweetness
would
really
round
out
the
experience
d
goes
down
fairly
easily
but
not
interesting
enough
to
want
more
than
one
of
drinkability
is
great
its
very
light
and
refreshing
and
i
had
no
problem
going
through
the
bottle
good
drinker
nice
brew
great
concept
d
overall
like
i
mentioned
earlier
a
great
marketing
ploy
but
doesnt
necessarily
translates
into
a
great
beer
overall
decent
per
style
but
a
bomber
is
the
limit
of
my
interest
and
wouldnt
care
for
this
in
six
pack
a
tart
lemony
blonde
that
somehow
didnt
quench
my
thirst
besides
the
appearance
this
was
only
slightly
better
then
average
all
around
from
the
650
ml
bottle
sampled
on
july
3
2010
it
pours
a
goldenyellow
color
with
about
two
fingers
of
fizzy
bubbly
white
head
and
lots
of
lacing
the
aroma
is
an
enticing
concoction
of
barley
malt
and
thin
hops
the
taste
is
almost
a
polar
opposite
with
a
noted
bitter
hoppiness
and
a
thinner
sweet
maltiness
decent
mouthfeel
i
love
liner
notes
and
this
one
declares
the
actual
latitude
and
logitude
of
where
the
barley
and
hops
were
harvested
you
cant
help
but
to
wonder
if
the
taste
would
have
been
different
if
these
ingredients
had
shifted
a
couple
of
degrees
likeable
beer
altogether
carbonation
could
be
toned
down
and
this
is
a
bit
thick
but
over
all
a
good
solid
rogue
brew
and
something
kind
of
new
poured
into
a
pint
glass
hazy
golden
in
color
with
good
carbonation
and
a
nice
thick
head
light
malty
and
baked
bread
aromas
with
some
citrus
and
hops
in
the
background
this
is
a
very
drinkable
beer
with
a
firm
metallic
body
and
mild
hop
flavors
that
make
it
refreshing
drinkability
im
glad
i
picked
this
one
up
i
fully
support
the
use
of
terroir
in
beer
less
transportation
cost
more
locally
produced
products
etc
but
this
beer
is
lacking
in
flavor
it
is
fully
adequate
in
every
other
area
i
guess
it
just
needed
some
tweaking
to
find
itself
i
would
purchase
again
mouthfeel
is
lightmedium
with
a
smooth
amount
of
carbonation
i
could
drink
this
all
day
it
went
down
easy
isnt
too
strong
and
is
actually
very
refreshing
i
will
probably
pick
up
a
few
more
bottles
to
make
this
my
brew
for
relaxing
on
a
summer
day
tastes
a
bit
more
adventurous
than
it
smells
makes
no
mistake
this
is
a
simple
ale
thats
not
supposed
to
blow
your
socks
off
but
its
really
well
brewed
and
theres
enough
going
on
to
keep
your
attention
make
it
more
or
less
worth
the
price
of
admission
very
hoppy
for
a
blonde
but
thats
fine
since
it
turns
out
the
malt
is
more
aggressive
than
the
aroma
had
led
me
to
anticipate
more
citrus
and
biscuit
in
the
taste
corn
is
gone
thankfully
some
light
spice
carbonation
and
hops
make
this
one
fairly
dry
and
not
quite
as
light
or
clean
as
normal
this
would
be
nice
on
a
hot
day
but
probably
only
one
it
is
well
hopped
pours
golden
and
cloudy
a
piney
fresh
hop
aroma
on
the
nose
flavor
is
a
mild
fruitiness
of
pineapple
or
melon
and
a
delicate
bitterness
a
sticky
hoppy
flavor
lingers
between
sips
comes
across
wet
and
refreshing
not
overly
flavorful
and
quite
sessionable
this
definitely
had
a
bit
of
a
dirty
blonde
thing
going
on
with
those
earthy
hops
and
fruit
flavors
getting
to
come
out
and
play
a
little
more
than
normal
for
the
style
the
malt
and
hop
profiles
here
were
pretty
honest
and
clean
thoughout
and
coupled
with
an
easy
feel
to
keep
the
drinkibility
of
this
good
i
had
no
problem
polishing
this
bomber
off
with
dinner
hey
sometimes
simpler
is
better
sometimes
you
just
want
a
straightforward
beer
with
a
clean
flavor
profile
chatoe
rogue
first
growth
single
malt
ale
fits
that
bill
the
politics
of
the
beer
sustainable
estate
grown
ingredients
is
icing
on
the
proverbial
cake
trying
a
new
one
from
an
oldie
but
goodie
rogue
i
like
the
concept
malt
and
hops
grown
by
rogue
beer
brewed
by
rogue
nice
sturdy
looking
beer
blonde
slightly
hazed
thick
rocky
head
not
a
lot
of
character
to
the
aroma
but
clean
crisp
and
grainy
mmm
much
more
going
on
here
than
the
nose
suggested
yes
pretty
basic
but
really
bright
flavors
here
nice
crispy
malt
light
dry
hop
nice
fresh
grain
and
hay
flavors
light
and
lively
on
the
palate
smooth
highly
refreshing
and
schwillable
the
best
quality
of
this
beer
is
its
simplicity
could
be
easily
summed
up
in
three
words
crisp
clean
fresh
golden
amber
with
a
sustained
white
head
fresh
grains
and
grassy
hops
aroma
the
taste
is
balanced
but
predictable
malt
flavors
are
smooth
and
grainy
some
pine
is
present
a
well
cared
for
beer
id
peg
it
for
more
of
an
amber
ale
it
should
be
in
a
six
pack
at
a
lesser
doller
per
ounce
ratio
d
an
all
around
beer
guy
beer
you
have
to
give
rogue
props
for
producing
their
own
barley
malt
hops
while
at
the
same
time
offering
a
beer
that
is
familiar
yet
distinctive
not
quite
as
nice
as
the
dirtoir
but
with
four
ingredients
locally
sourced
you
cant
find
many
that
are
better
what
can
i
say
i
am
something
of
a
sucker
for
gimmicky
offerings
but
i
think
this
is
a
special
beer
a
pretty
tasty
and
drinkable
blonde
ale
one
way
more
enjoyable
than
the
anemic
standard
for
the
style
and
propped
up
with
the
malt
and
hop
characteristics
of
well
nearly
a
properly
rendered
czech
pilsener
of
all
things
well
revolutions
often
have
a
sideeffect
of
recalibrating
expectations
and
rogue
has
provided
at
least
a
glimpse
of
that
here
color
was
very
nice
a
nice
golden
amber
a
nice
head
of
off
white
color
again
taste
was
nothing
more
than
average
kind
of
disappointed
both
the
aroma
and
taste
are
very
clean
and
awfully
reminiscent
of
a
lager
i
know
this
is
technically
an
ale
but
im
not
sure
that
id
be
able
to
pick
it
out
a
kolschpils
lineup
you
get
that
pilsnerlike
bite
at
the
end
but
otherwise
its
very
balanced
although
abv
is
unknown
id
be
shocked
if
it
was
north
of
5
5
so
its
exceedingly
quaffable
i
cant
get
over
how
carbonated
it
is
my
glass
nearly
overflowed
on
every
pour
throughout
the
bottle
so
that
makes
it
a
good
choice
on
a
hot
day
im
not
sure
that
single
malt
does
for
beer
what
it
does
for
scotch
but
this
ones
a
winner
opened
up
a
bottle
today
and
poured
it
into
a
pint
glass
the
beer
was
orange
in
color
and
a
bit
hazy
the
head
was
substantial
and
there
was
a
bit
of
lacing
on
the
glass
took
in
a
deep
smell
of
this
ale
and
the
smell
of
caramel
and
hops
were
detected
immediately
soon
after
the
lingering
smell
of
malts
became
apparent
i
took
my
first
sip
of
this
ale
and
could
immediately
taste
the
caramel
and
hops
then
it
balanced
it
self
of
well
with
the
malts
quite
honestly
it
was
very
tasty
the
drinkability
of
this
ale
was
very
smooth
this
ale
surprised
me
as
i
was
not
expecting
much
i
will
definitely
pick
up
another
bottle
when
i
get
the
chance
this
is
a
blonde
ale
could
have
fooled
me
its
so
hop
forward
in
a
pint
glass
the
beer
was
a
hazy
orange
color
with
a
small
white
head
and
a
little
bit
of
lace
very
citrus
aroma
a
little
malt
big
time
grapefruit
taste
some
malt
that
was
hidden
by
the
hops
not
very
balanced
not
like
any
blonde
i
have
had
but
still
a
nice
beer
drinkability
is
good
an
enjoyable
brew
want
to
thank
merlin48
for
sharing
this
one
with
me
highly
drinkable
and
reasonably
priced
overall
my
first
estate
beer
was
from
sierra
and
maybe
i
was
spoiled
but
given
that
this
one
was
from
the
great
northwest
i
was
slightly
disappointed
that
said
i
was
looking
for
something
more
bold
hoppy
and
rich
that
prejudice
may
have
led
me
to
not
quite
fully
appreciate
the
fact
that
as
a
nice
crisp
and
refreshing
summer
beer
the
chatoe
rogue
would
be
absolutely
ideal
i
like
the
idea
of
this
beer
and
im
glad
i
tried
it
because
ive
often
thought
of
growing
barley
and
am
growing
hops
right
now
in
my
backyard
i
dont
think
i
would
reach
for
it
again
based
on
flavor
but
i
might
it
is
a
well
disguised
high
gravity
beer
overall
not
anything
special
or
anything
id
seek
out
again
d
drinks
rather
nicely
even
though
if
it
is
uninteresting
dry
pop
rock
palate
upfront
but
a
gypsum
and
resin
dry
palate
i
the
finish
picked
up
this
bottle
at
hyvee
on
grand
in
des
moines
pour
a
hazy
blonde
with
a
very
loose
head
the
aroma
is
citrusy
and
piney
with
some
honey
and
good
fruitiness
the
flavor
is
grapefruit
with
a
little
saltiness
and
a
nice
all
around
citrus
rind
bitterness
not
bad
d
not
a
bad
beer
but
it
just
doesnt
have
alot
to
it
its
just
boring
so
to
speak
of
all
of
the
beers
rogue
had
produced
over
the
years
ive
liked
most
of
them
i
have
to
say
im
a
bit
dissappointed
drinkability
im
just
not
into
rogues
first
foray
into
the
chateaubeer
world
this
beer
is
awfully
rough
around
the
edges
and
my
guess
would
be
that
this
is
due
to
the
hops
i
just
dont
think
this
variety
is
wellsuited
to
a
singlevariety
beer
drinkability
ill
admit
its
a
cute
concept
decently
drinkable
and
not
quite
as
simplistic
and
onedimensional
as
id
first
anticipated
lets
see
where
they
go
with
this
whole
gyo
idea
pours
a
toasted
grain
color
with
a
fairly
tight
off
white
head
that
settles
inot
a
light
cap
the
aroma
is
quite
faint
there
is
a
very
light
bready
malt
scent
thats
about
it
the
taste
is
of
a
light
malt
with
some
fruity
notes
and
a
subtle
grassy
bitter
hop
bite
the
feel
is
moderate
with
very
fizzy
carbonation
lightly
sweet
on
the
palate
and
finishes
slightly
bitter
a
nice
easy
drinking
brew
good
balance
between
the
sweet
malt
and
grassy
hops
the
flavor
wont
blow
you
away
but
you
can
easily
pack
away
a
few
of
these
doing
the
math
that
means
an
fg
of
1
011
and
an
abv
of
4
9
certainly
not
worth
the
price
and
really
doesnt
work
as
a
pale
or
a
blonde
love
the
idea
of
the
series
but
this
needs
some
adjustments
in
next
years
batch
tinny
mouthfeel
good
carbonation
with
decent
heft
just
a
hair
on
the
watery
side
slightly
bitter
dry
finish
the
hopping
is
just
on
this
side
of
blonde
ale
understated
and
a
little
boring
overall
i
definitely
think
this
was
more
of
an
apa
than
an
american
blonde
either
way
its
a
very
understated
beer
certainly
not
bad
but
also
not
worth
seeking
out
pours
a
nice
dark
golden
amber
with
a
substantial
thick
creamy
head
not
much
to
write
home
about
in
the
sniffer
department
as
best
as
i
can
tell
but
not
unpleasant
either
light
hoppy
flavor
and
exceptionally
easy
to
drink
definitely
an
interesting
offering
from
one
of
my
favorite
breweries
especially
when
you
consider
that
this
is
a
true
diy
brew
drinkability
is
very
good
wellrounded
beer
well
executed
for
the
style
but
not
exactly
on
my
list
of
favorite
styles
if
this
was
in
6ers
for
the
pool
party
summer
it
would
be
a
better
fit
d
not
impressed
with
this
one
very
basic
flavors
not
complex
at
all
dissapointed
cause
rogue
makes
some
decent
beers
rogue
first
growth
single
malt
ale
is
cloudy
bright
golden
and
very
lively
with
a
foamy
white
head
that
has
outstanding
retention
oh
outstanding
lacing
and
sip
lines
too
it
has
a
bright
fruity
aroma
thats
recognizable
as
rogue
there
are
notes
of
lemon
and
tropical
fruit
it
has
a
super
smooth
mediumlight
body
with
a
crisp
clean
finish
theres
a
nice
resiny
bitterness
and
hop
flavor
that
veers
toward
pineapple
and
mango
the
malt
pretty
much
stays
out
of
the
way
and
isnt
really
sweet
or
dry
its
really
yummy
this
is
a
spoton
american
pale
ale
i
had
this
after
working
all
day
in
the
yard
in
90degree
weather
talk
about
quenching
and
refreshing
good
carbonation
smoother
on
the
mouth
than
i
thought
it
might
be
easy
drinking
i
had
no
problem
putting
down
a
bomber
cloudy
golden
body
white
head
toast
lemon
peel
and
yeast
on
the
nose
same
on
the
palate
light
toasty
grain
moderate
citrus
hop
flavor
and
a
very
dry
finish
light
body
i
enjoyed
it
but
nothing
i
would
seek
out
again
quite
ordinary
uninspired
i
have
to
say
to
me
seeing
rogue
do
a
malt
driven
beer
seems
strange
poured
a
bright
lighter
golden
with
a
fluffy
one
finger
white
head
that
left
broken
rings
of
lace
as
it
settled
very
slowly
light
aromasmainly
light
honeyand
toasty

honey
malt
flavors
hit
up
front
on
the
palate
along
with
some
toastygraininessa
faint
herbal
hop
note
lingers
in
the
finish
its
lagerish
to
me
flavor
wiseits
crisp
and
relatively
cleannot
bad
drinkability
is
ok
would
be
so
much
better
if
it
had
a
tad
more
flavor
diversity
certainly
not
a
blonde
ale
in
my
opinion
delicious
and
worth
the
price
you
cant
go
wrong
d
this
isnt
normally
my
favorite
style
but
this
wasnt
too
bad
for
a
blonde
i
was
pleasantly
surprised
by
the
bitterness
not
rogues
best
but
not
a
flop
either
its
a
little
too
bitter
for
a
nonipa
i
finished
the
beer
10
minutes
ago
and
i
can
still
taste
the
hops
id
love
to
see
more
from
the
gyo
series
just
something
a
little
less
unbalanced
overall
this
is
a
fantastic
fresh
tasting
brew
and
its
great
to
see
that
a
single
malt
and
single
hop
ale
can
come
out
so
good
great
job
to
rogue
for
yet
another
great
beer

drinkability
is
solid
i
am
not
a
fan
of
many
blonde
ales
but
this
and
nbs
are
two
of
the
best
not
much
different
than
pabst
had
at
logan
where
the
options
are
always
disappointing
and
this
did
not
disappoint
in
its
disappointment
this
has
all
the
characteristics
of
a
macro
so
in
that
regards
if
sales
take
off
they
are
ready
it
has
little
smell
or
taste
i
gave
it
a
strong
score
for
look
as
i
am
wearing
my
favorite
sweater
today
and
i
think
the
beer
looks
good
next
to
me
overall
this
is
very
much
a
beer
so
good
work
shipyard
this
beer
doesnt
not
taste
at
all
how
i
remember
it
its
been
seven
years
so
i
guess
time
may
have
warped
my
memory
it
seems
to
be
skunked
but
i
bought
it
at
my
go
to
store
which
is
reputable
and
has
fresh
product
either
i
remember
a
bad
beer
as
good
or
it
got
skunked
along
the
way
drinkable
with
a
pleasant
woody
finish
however
it
has
a
weak
hop
profile
and
tastes
kind
of
like
wort
rinse
taste
a
lot
like
budweiser
if
budweiser
had
a
much
more
beer
flavor
to
it
instead
of
a
watered
down
taste
i
like
it
but
prefer
prelude
from
shipyard
a
pretty
good
beer
i
did
not
like
this
beer
funk
on
the
nose
no
head
to
speak
of
little
body
and
an
odd
taste
bitter
and
foul
mouthfeel
was
ok
would

nice
beer
with

certainly
drink
it
again

ale
with
not
much
going
for
or
against
it
a

though
and
the

arent

aroma

suit
here
downright
impressive
the
taste
leaves
a
little
to
be
desired
for
me
personally
but
i
could
see
someone
being
absolutely
crazy
about
this
beer
it
has
a
great
profile
and
is
pretty
complex
i
like
how
the
malt
and
hop
wrestle
each
other
for
dominance
as
stated
the
hop
actually
wins
the
battle
by
the
end
of
the
taste
it
is
a
good
beer
and
im
sure
its
great
on
tap
give
it

this

this
one
is
obviously
an
english
ale
quite
sweet
malty
and
only
slightly
bitter
not
exactly
a
hopheads
favorite
style
but
a

of
the

not

not

this
is
one
beer
that
goes
great
at

at

a

more
publike
in

demeanor

profilenot
quite
solid
enough
to
demand
seconds
but
not

the
export
is
my
go
to
beer
when
the
only
other
options
is
miller
and
budweiser
perfectly
drinkable
beer
that
you
could
have
one
too
many
of
i
always
like
to
support
local
and
shipyard
produces
a
lot
of
other
good
beers
it
has
better
taste
and
presence
on
the
pallet
than
a
macro
but
does
no
favors
either
only
the
second
shipyard
ive
had
and
probably
the
better
of
the
two
i
was
impressed
with
its
appearance
a
very
nice
dark
amber
color
almost
honeylike
the
odor
was
a
weird
mix
of
malty
sweetness
with
you
regular
beer
smell
i
wasnt
entirely
sure
i
liked
it
but
it
was
altogether
that
bad
mouthfeel
was
just
a
bit
better
than
okay
i
was
very
impressed
with
the
taste
a
nice
roasty
sweet
malt
and
hops
flavor
that
was
crisp
going
down
overall
a
decent
beer
im
glad
i
still
have
plenty
to
go
through
not
unpleasant
as
a
quick
thirst
quencher
but
not
something
i
want
to
go
back
to
you
with
any
frequency
drink
cold
overall
solid
session
beer
easy
and
approachable
but
with
enough
flavor
complexity
that
it
isnt
immediately
forgettable
it
doesnt
really
stand
out
as
something
i
need
a
cooler
full
of
but
id
certainly
have
it
again
strikes
me
as
a
good
beer
for
a
hot
day
the
crack
was
nice
and
loud
the
can
brimful
and
the
glug
inverted
i
have
gotten
quite
practiced
at
doing
this
and
i
can
intuit
when
to
back
off
of
the
pour
so
as
to
avoid
overflow
the
resulting
two
fingers
of
dense
tawny
head
evinced
good
retention
and
produced
some
nice
lacing
as
it
fell

with
just
the
slightest
hint
of
a
haze
my
old
friends
croesus
mammon
and
midas
came
by
for
a
taste
but
as
usual
they
proved
incapable
of
sharing
so
i
went
ahead
with
my
business
nose
had
a
clover
honeylike
sweetness
and
when
i
closed
my
eyes
i
swore
that
i
was
smelling
lager
mouthfeel
was
kind
of
full
thick
and
viscous
and
while
the
taste
was
very
much
like
honey
it
was
cloyingly
sweet
ugh
i
am
not
a
big
fan
of
sweet
especially
in
beer
hence
my
being
a
selfavowed
hophead
the
finish
remained
ungodly
sweet
and
i
was
not
enamored
of
it
there
was
nothing
intrinsically
wrong
with
this
beer
and
it
was
stylistically
correct
but
it
just
was
not
my
cuppa
tea

beer
drinkers
in

export
ale
for
the
tourists
pours
a
lush
golden
brown
upon
pouring
aroma
begins
to
be
noticeable
which
is
a
heavily
malted
scent
this
i
believe
is
shipyards
best
work
their
ipas
usually
miss
the
mark
but
theyre
american
style
beers
are
on
point
very
drinkable
great
color
not
to
heavy
not
to
light
this
is
a
versatile
beer
whether
its
9
degrees
on
a
maine
night
or
a
july
4th
weekend
this
beer
is
good
to
go
anytime
of
year
arguably
its
best
attribute
is
the
aftertaste
which
is
sweet
and
malty
and
makes
you
want
another
round
good
stuff
here
by
shipyard
cheers
o
typical
blonde
nothing
too
special
here
o
dont
recommend
not
much
better
than
an
aal
and
would
in
fact
drink
many
aals
over
this
as
ive
has
several
that
are
actually
better
tasting
and
even
ones
that
are
similar
in
taste
quality
would
be
much
cheaper
this
is
supposed
to
be
a
decent
beer
but
it
just
tasted
off
cheap
sourness
is
the
best
way
to
describe
it
maybe
the
lines
were
dirty
at
the
bar
who
knows
still
though
i
wont
purchase
this
again
o
perhaps
some
proof
that
enjoyment
is
all
in
the
presentation
and
the
environmental
conditions
did
not
particularly
appreciate
the
first
one
i
had
but
this
one
rocks
very
satisfying
that
it
only
cost
me
a
dollar
warms
my
scottish
soul
even
as
the
beer
cools

and
a
small
bite
from
the
carbonation
body
is
thin
and
not
heavy
doesnt
finish
well
because
it
finishes
sweet
and
the
diacetyl
leaves
bitter
its
just
ok
overall
this
is
certainly
good
summer
fare
being
light
and
crisp
but
largely
suffering
from
a
lack
of
sugars
to
help
counter
the
heavy
grain
flavors
pretty
dull
nothing
technically
wrong
it
seems
well
crafted
but
boring
like
a
us
version
of
john
smiths
looks
good
but
the
aroma
and
flavour
dont
hold
your
interest
decent
body
though
rather
too
dry
with
so
many
great
beers
out
there
this
isnt

some
grassy
flavors
on
the

there
is
a
mild
amount
of

bitterness
on
the
palate

each
sip
this
beer
has
a
lower
level
of
carbonation
with
a
slightly
crisp
but
somewhat
medium
bodied
mouthfeel
overall
this
is
an
above
average
beer
with
a
pretty
good
smell
but
the
taste
doesnt
match
up
in
my
opinion
not
a
terrible
beer
but
not
a
great
beer
by
any
stretch
pale
and
sweet
easy
to
drink
with
low
impacts
i
guess
i
can
see
the
appeal
this
is
sweet
and
mellow
its
very
drinkable
but
its
not
particularly
interesting
also
its
not
an
american
blonde
sorry
overall
this
beer
has
great
flavors
of
malt
in
the
finish
and
to
a
lesser
extent
some
delicate
floral
hops
at
the
end
the
malt
gives
it
a
great
beer
smell
and
it
is
satisfying
to
swig
the
carbonation
makes
it
sessionable
and
it
has
a
fullness
that
domestics
lack
without
being
overbearing
like
a
dipa
or
a
stout
i
would
def
order
this
as
a
pitcher
at
the
bar

o
a
good
ale
this
was
all
half
jokingly
medium

solid
brew
with

plenty

a

easy

this
is
a
o
k
beer
not
something
i
would
seek
out
overall
good
brew
not
my
first
choice
though
i
cant
believe
i
havent
tried
this
beer
before
now
being
from
maine
and
all
but
it
is
really
good
just
the
right
balance
of
hops
and
malt
i
can
taste
the
cascade
hops
that
must
be
in
there
if
you
havent
tried
this
in
a
while
try
it
again
it
is
really
good
i
am
a
home
brewer
and
this
is
the
taste
that
i
have
been
trying
to
get
in
my
homebrew
i
will
always
have
some
in
the
fridge
from
now
on
mouthfeel
is
light
crisp
smooth
and
almost
watery
with
a
very
light
feel
and
very
light
carbonation
and
a
finish
thats
almost
dry
highly
drinkability
but
the
flavor
is
just
average
and
its
kind
of
boring
this
is
a
weird
beer
its
a
little
unbalanced
the
hop
character
isnt
smooth
and
over
powers
what
little
malt
comes
through
this
is
probably
a
one
and
done
for
me
ov
very
simple
while
not
seeming
thin
refreshing
and
is
worthy
of
drinking
2
or
3
almost
tingly
like
a
champagne
the
aftertaste
can
turn
away
many
but
it
grew
on
me
i
can
drink
several
of
these
and
would
probably
ask
for
more
cheers
o
a
very
good
session
beer
tastes
great
looks
great
goes
down
easy
and
has
a
reasonable
abv
so
you
can
slam
a
few
back
and
still
go
about
your
daily
routine
great
example
of
a
blonde
ale
will
definitely
drink
again
a
safe
light
ale
that
would
be
okay
to
session
not
alot
to
write
home
about
however
tasting
the
beer
the
flavors
appear
accordingly
nice
mouthfeel
finishes
the
tasting
very
drinkable
light
lagerwith

carbonation
just
like
it
was
meant
to
be
for
this
style
tried
the
shipyard
export
ale
whilst
in
orlando
at
the
ale
house
the
beer
poured
a
clear
golden
pale
color
with
virtually
no
head
and
no
lace
the
smell
was
mostly
grain
with
slight
lemonycitrus
hop
the
taste
was
very
clean
with
cereal
base
and
lemon
hints
mouthfeel
was
light
in
body
and
so
so
carbonation
overall
wasnt
bad
good
for
a
warmer
winter
night
in
fla
o
the
best
of
a
bad
lot
from
this
mixed
6
pack
shipyard
should
ensure
less
stock
put
out
there
as
this
likely
was
an
old
12
it
included
the
summer
ale
and
they
had
a
bunch
of
them
stacked
in
the
main
section
where
it
was
room
temperature
for
a
long
while
this
is
the
type
of
craft
beer
that
people
would
buy
and
not
like
due
to
age
overall
a
prety
good
beer
would
recommend
nice
malt
flavor
the
pour
is
a
golden
color
with
some
nice
white
lacing
down
the
glass
and
a
decent
head
although
a
bit
soapy
scents
are
a
bit
off
may
have
been
the
date
of
the
beer
not
quite
sure
what
an
american
blonde
ale
is
but
to
me
this
is
a
cross
between
some
type
of
a
pilsner
and
possibly
an
apa
it
is
quite
easy
to
drink
fairly
smooth
except
a
bit
tingly
on
the
back
end
and
quite
a
bit
yeasty
a
decent
beer
for
sure
just
not
a
top
grade
microbrewed
beer
but
good
in
its
own
right
why
am
i
drinking
this
oh
yeah
it
was
free
avoid
this
beer
unless
you
like

i
have
very

in

a

without

o
this
beer
just
doesnt

i
dont
know
what
its
supposed
to
be
but
it
just
doesnt
work
as
it
is
something
is
off
im
glad
i
just
bought
one
as
i
dont
think
i
will
ever
come
back
to
this
beer
overall
nice
drinkable
beer
with
a
pretty
mild
standard
taste
nothing
crazy
here
not
bad
just
not
impressive
either
o
not
much
flavor
but
is
very
drinkable
being
a
very
generic
ale
o
a
bit
below
average
falvorwise
in
my
book
kind
of
disorganized
coarse
with
an
overall
flavor
that
really
doesnt
bind
and
flow
well
together
comes
off
as
a
mess
cannot
see
a
repurchase
in
the
future
pours
a

to
it
from
the
buttery
flavor
light
body
finishes
a
bit
off
to
me
light
to
medium
bodied
with
moderate
carbonation
this
is
a
drinkable
yet
filling
beer
the
body
is
rather
light
considering
the
flavors
the
carbonation
is
a
little
fizzy
but
does
not
detract
from
the
flavors
one
bit
overall
a
step
above
average
across
the
board
attributes
are
a
bit
more
developed
than
a
typical
blonde
makes
for
a
nice
casual
ale
this
beer
is
surprisingly
smooth
though
not
lacking
crispness
the
body
is
on
the
lighter
side
of
medium
it
is
a
little
bit
slick
other
than
which
makes
for
a
very
good
mouthfeel
o
standard
session
brew
that
wont
blow
you
away
but
is
still
satisfying
and
goodtasting
really
great
malt
balance
i
just
had
to
comment
due
to
my
previous
perception
of
this
beer
i
was
really
pleased
with
it
o
a
really
tasty
sessionable
ale
cant
beat
it
in
the
summer
heat
o
smooth
drinking
if
unremarkable
otherwise
highly
sessionable
when
eating
summer
food
this
is
pretty
damn
easy
to
drink
havent
had
this
one
in
over
a
year
since
a
road
trip
up
to
maine
not
as
good
as
i
remembered
but
still
very
enjoyable
would
like
to
see
this
more
often
o
no
big
flavor
profiles
but
well
balanced
and
easy
drinking
a
solid
effort
all
around
o
an
average
blonde
nothing
overwhelmingly
impressive
but
if
youre
in
the
mood
for
this
style
its
a
good
one
to
try
o
never
again
on
my
pallet
the
pour
has
a
half
finger
head
the
color
is
clear
with
an
golden
color
and
touch
of
amber
aromas
are
of
barley
taste
is
smooth
with
a
very
mild
hop
finish
sweet
apple
malt
is
appreciated
mild
to
moderate
carbonation
the
beer
is
average
in
taste
it
is
a
safe
brew
without
overwhelming
nor
underwhelming
qualities
overall
better
than
what
my
first
impression
would
have
had
me
believe
upon
the
initial
pour
nothing
great
but
worth
trying
the
taste
was
very
well
balanced
it
wasnt
bitter
or
sweet
but
i
could
taste
lots
of
malt
character
and
hop
character
nonetheless
the
taste
was
heavier
on
the
hop
character
than
id
like
it
was
oddly
lacking
in
bitterness
considering
that
it
still
managed
to
taste
like
grass
ive
mentioned
in
many
reviews
that
i
dont
like
my
beer
to
taste
like
grass
however
other
than
that
it
was
great
i
loved
the
balance
and
i
loved
that
the
flavours
were
not
masked
by
bitterness
from
the
hops
or
from
burnt
malt
nor
was
any
of
the
flavour
masked
by
sweetness
aside
from
the
grassy
flavour
it
was
a
fantastic
beer
o
standard
aba
sometimes
come
back
to
depending
upon
what
else
is
served
the
pour
was
about
what
i
would
have
expected
given
the
style
light
golden
in
color
with
a
medium
level
of
haze
and
cloudiness
to
it
that
obscured
a
bit
of
the
sunlight
poking
through
nice
head
of
white
capped
the
top
and
settled
down
smoothly
and
evenly
creating
a
decent
broken
crown
that
ringed
the
side
of
the
glass
and
kept
some
nice
lacing
aroma
was
light
and
this
would
be
a
trend
throughout
the
day
light
notes
of
peach
and
light
grain
are
really
all
that
is
coming
through
right
now
warming
brought
a
smidge
of
citrus
to
it
but
nothing
really
standing
out
here
for
me
at
all
crisp
clean
flavor
though
with
light
hints
of
clove
and
heather
that
sat
on
top
of
a
base
that
resembled
mostly
light
fruits
and
hints
of
grain
smooth
light
body
was
not
overly
carbonated
but
rather
a
bit
silky
and
left
just
the
right
amount
of
dryness
on
the
tongue
as
it
worked
itself
through
a
deep
golden
color
with
about
a
two
finger
head
that
sits
around
for
a
while
the
nose
has
sweet
pale
malt
and
a
lot
of
peppery
floral
hops
the
body
is
light
tangysweet
biscuit
hops
are
light
as
well
over
the
malt
but
still
very
earthy
but
more
fruit
flavors
are
pronounced
a
lot
of
peach
and
bitter
sourness
finishes
dry
and
tangy
light
fruit
its
a
little
hoppy
for
a
blonde
medium
bodied
the
flavor
is
light
fruits
pear
white
grape
followed
by
a
bit
of
floral
hops
sweet
bread
a
dry
finish
and
a
raw
grain
aftertaste
very
enjoyable
and
worth
having
another
o
ok
its
certainly
not
a
bad
beer
but
its
lacks
depth
to
be
a
truly
good
one
very
average
pretty
solid
better
than
i
recall
from
a
few
years
back
either
its
better
or
im
less
a
snob
either
way
im
happy
its
around
again
drinkability
this
is
a
pretty
solid
brew
reminds
me
of
a
german
pilsner
easy
drinking
and
sessionable
very
nice
for
spring
and
summer
nothing
complicated
no
frills
well
crafted
drinkability
pretty
good
but
not
great
d
good
drinkability
this
is
a
very
easy
drinking
beer
nothing
to
interesting
notes
not
a
bad
beer
and
interesting
style
which
is
a
plus
i
am
happy
i
picked
up
this
one
a
good
style
for
a
warm
day
as
well
cheers
notes
another
safe
offering
from
shipyard
sure
to
be
a
crowdpleaser
a
better
alternative
to
the
ubiquitous
macro
lagers
but
nothing
special
otherwise
i
didnt
mind
drinking
it
but
i
wouldnt
give
it
a
second
look
o
not
likely
to
buy
this
again
there
are
other
beers
of
this
style
i
prefer
pleasantly
surprised
with
this
ill
be
picking
up
a
six
pack
of
this
next
time
aroma
is
malty
and
crisp
more
like
a
lager
than
an
ale
but
still
all
right
it
pours
a
clear
bubbly
amber
with
a
rather
thick
and
fluffy
offwhite
head
flavor
is
crisp
and
malty
with
a
fruity
undertone
mainly
apple
and
banana
and
a
hint
of
hoppy
bitterness
texture
is
fairly
smooth
and
edgy
leaving
behind
a
nice
tingle
this
is
a
good
party
beer
or
an
accompaniment
for
a
hearty
meal
one
of
those
the
best
available
option
beers
among
boring
beer
lists
overall
this
is
a
beer
with
some
easily
fixable
flaws
the
fermentation
schedule
or
temperature
is
most
likely
to
blame
here
most
likely
both
put
together
trying
to
move
the
beer
as
fast
as
they
could
i
think
i
would
like
to
try
this
again
but
maybe
at
the
brewery
or
at
a
pub
who
just
changed
the
keg
drinkability
not
that
great
reminds
me
of
red
stripe
and
would
probably
be
just
as
good
on
a
hot
summer
day
on
a
beach
poured
a
translucent
amber
brown
with
yellow
highlights
with
a
very
thin
head
and
almost
no
lacing
sticking
to
the
glass
the
aroma
was
malty
sweet
various
grain
notes
very
slight
peach
and
citrus
the
taste
was
also
dominated
by
the
malts
alongside
citrusy
mild
peach
and
various
grain
accents
the
brew
was
medium
in
body
with
a
good
amount
of
carbonation
which
had
a
sweet
mild
fruity
malty
and
grainy
finish
it
drank
really
good
and
was
a
decent
blonde
beer
overall
from
what
i
know
this
one
isnt
widely
available
in
my
immediate
area
but
i
certainly
am
not
going
to
lose
sleep
over
that
fact
good
for
a
conversation
piece
maybe
a
beer
to
kill
the
monotony
between
beers
and
its
a
good
drink
but
not
something
id
spring
for
unless
the
options
were
more
limited
mouthfeel
is
light
with
a
crisp
amount
of
carbonation
the
tastes
matches
the
smell
with
a
grain
taste
to
the
finish
starts
with
a
buttery
smooth
and
as
the
carbonation
builds
this
taste
slowly
fades
and
becomes
a
dryer
mouth
with
a
pale
malt
taste
lingering
drinkability
its
a
smooth
sufficiently
tasty
albeit
kinda
buttery
blonde
which
is
exactly
what
i
was
expecting
from
shipyard
cheers
verdict
not
good
but
very
drinkable
unique
and
cheap
d
its
good
im
glad
it
came
in
the
mixpack
i
got
i
wouldnt
buy
a
sixpack
of
just
this
though
this
ale
is
something
different
but
nothing
to
rave
about
it
pours
a
golden
yellow
color
with
not
to
much
of
a
scent
its
a
fairly
lighty
drinking
beer
for
being
an
ale
it
does
have
a
slight
bitter
and
spice
taste
to
it
something
new
to
try
but
probably
not
going
to
be
anyones
new
favorite
db
not
much
to
say
but
nothing
bad
to
say
either
i
would
say
this
one
pretty
much
splits
right
down
the
middle
a
simple
ale
with
a
decent
flavor
set
would
probably
be
good
for
someone
new
to
the
craft
this
is
pretty
good
for
a
blonde
highly
drinkable
for
most
d
very
good
drinkability
with
a
nice
balance
between
hop
and
malt
many
can
go
down
in
a
sitting
and
not
overwhelm
or
distract
my
first
recent
taste
of
this
brew
brought
back
good
memories
of
micro
sampling
many
years
ago
im
glad
to
find
out
shipyard
is
going
strong
its
a
clean
ale
a
bit
thin
but
a
great
lawnmower
or
gateway
creaft
beer
for
the
bmc
crowd
not
a
bad
beer
overall
though
d
the
beer
is
very
easy
to
drink
and
is
quite
sessionable
dr
a
easy
to
drink
mild
good
flavored
beer
a
little
too
sweet
to
have
more
than
one
or
two
one
of
the
first
craft
beers
i
have
had
decided
to
review
it
recently
after
having
one
on
tap
to
relive
the
beginning
not
as
great
as
i
remember
but
still
worth
a
shot
meh
its
like
an
inferior
version
of
sierra
nevada
pale
ale
pours
a
clean
yellow
color
with
a
white
head
in
the
aroma
gingerbread
maltiness
in
the
taste
well
like
buttery
gingerbread
a
small
bite
and
small
to
medium
bodied
mouthfeel
and
a
semi
dry
maltiness
in
the
aftertaste
very
english
kind
of
feel
like
part
of
the
sam
smith
line
but
not
as
good
poured
from
a
brown
12
oz
bottle
has
a
rich
golden
color
with
a
12
inch
head
smell
is
rather
mild
some
hops
taste
is
a
balance
of
hops
and
malts
a
bit
on
the
light
side
feels
medium
bodied
in
the
mouth
and
has
good
drinkability
overall
this
is
a
pretty
good
beer
pretty
well
rounded
beer
not
bad
highly
drinkable
good
everyday
beer
easy
drinking
beer
thats
more
interesting
than
the
average
blonde
ale
taste
a
nice
initial
grasp
of
carbonation
and
light
hops
light
caramel
very
light
it
recedes
though
not
into
something
good
it
just
goes
away
and
becomes
watery
just
not
a
fan
of
this
could
get
comparable
stuff
for
cheaper
d
there
are
better
more
wellrounded
and
smoother
light
ales
out
there
but
shipyards
export
isnt
all
that
bad
its
very
clean
and
looks
good
for
the
style
even
pretty
quenching
and
might
pair
with
grilled
chicken
or
a
summer
salad
however
there
is
a
milled
graininess
and
boring
flavor
that
bump
the
drinkability
down
a
couple
notches
i
think
this
would
be
a
good
summer
beer
lawnmower
i
will
check
with
the
store
the
mixed
6pack
came
from
to
see
how
much
a
6
pack
of
export
costs
it
might
be
a
good
summer
drinker
when
most
people
would
go
for
a
bmc
having
said
that
if
ti
costs
the
same
as
most
micros
i
probably
go
with
something
with
more
flavor
drinkability
i
think
if
this
style
was
something
you
enjoyed
you
could
drink
a
sixer
over
a
couple
hours
no
problem
not
much
to
it
d
very
drinkable
on
both
hot
and
cold
days
i
had
this
beer
almost
every
day
in
portland
maine
during
the
winter
tasty
not
too
flavourful
but
does
the
job
just
bland
boring
and
ho
hum
something
i
will
probably
bring
to
a
memorial
day
bbq
this
weekend
not
really
bad
just
uninteresting
pours
a
golden
honey
color
with
a
thin
white
head
nose
has
dry
malts
and
grainy
hops
about
aberage
in
the
flavor
department
as
well
grassy
malts
and
some
stale
hops
the
body
is
light
but
clean
possibly
the
best
aspect
of
the
beer
not
bad
but
nothing
too
special
either
d
this
is
a
really
easy
drinking
and
enjoyable
beer
picked
this
up
on
a
whim
ive
always
seen
this
on
the
shelves
but
somehow
they
just
dont
stand
out
and
after
drinking
it
i
know
why
nothing
really
to
want
you
to
come
back
way
too
tangy
to
the
point
that
it
overwhelms
the
malts
and
you
get
a
wierd
tang
from
start
to
finish
it
would
be
drinkable
on
a
hot
day
but
what
isnt
i
think
at
one
time
these
guys
were
handled
by
miller
and
i
think
that
is
maybe
where
the
taste
went
this
is
a
quite
drinkable
fairly
well
balanced
beer
i
could
see
drinking
a
few
of
these
at
one
sitting
it
would
go
great
at
a
bbq
or
with
a
burger
something
for
a
warm
summer
day
pretty
good
would
be
easy
to
session
there
really
isnt
anything
to
dislike
about
it
but
it
doesnt
bring
any
game
changing
traits
to
the
table
either
good
in
all
ways
but
great
in
none
serving
type
12
ounce
bottle
feel
was
pretty
bubbly
the
medium
body
was
pretty
slick
i
wouldnt
choose
to
drink
any
of
these
in
the
future
the
flavor
just
didnt
agree
with
me
d
goes
down
easy
enough
but
nothing
special
overall
an
average
american
pale
ale
not
really
much
else
to
say
poured
a
nice
pale
color
with
some
carbonation
that
lingers
nose
is
pretty
weak
fruity
with
malt
detectable
taste
is
somewhat
bitter
with
more
of
alcohol
taste
and
not
too
much
of
other
flavors
detectable
overall
an
interesting
take
on
a
pale
ale
but
nothing
that
impresses
me
much
taste
is
a
bit
sharp
and
bitter
quite
carbonated
something
is
a
bit
odd
with
this
beer
though
i
had
it
with
a
couple
others
and
we
all
thought
it
was
a
pretty
poor
beer
not
easy
to
drink
and
didnt
sit
well
with
any
of
us
skip
it
value
ill
tell
ya
i
paid
6
00
for
a
sixer
of
this
you
couldnt
do
much
better
for
a
buck
a
beer
poured
a
clear
almost
translucent
golden
body
with
a
big
foamy
head
on
top
of
a
faint
aromatic
body
of
mild
hops
and
malts
a
little
too
sharp
for
my
liking
a
mild
even
bland
ale
that
doesnt
pack
much
in
the
hops
or
malts
department
and
just
comes
across
as
a
tad
overly
hopped
with
a
dry
cutting
backbite
has
a
little
punch
to
it
compared
to
macros
but
not
my
favorite
ale
at
all
this
is
a
lightbodied
beer
it
never
really
coats
the
tongue
and
the
relatively
high
degree
of
carbonation
keeps
it
crisp
and
refreshing
between
the
solid
balance
of
flavors
and
aroma
clean
mouthfeel
and
modest
abv
i
could
easily
see
myself
having
several
across
a
prolonged
session
this
is
an
under
appreciated
beer
im
well
above
the
curve
on
this
one
drinkability
you
could
session
this
if
you
wanted
but
it
isnt
anything
id
recommend
i
wonder
if
the
taps
condition
at
the
local
establishment
did
not
affect
this
pourbeer
since
i
can
not
imagine
many
folks
enjoy
this
beer
in
this
condition
poured
a
dark
gold
with
no
head
or
lacing
but
just
a
small
collar
that
stayed
with
the
beeer
throughout
beer
was
almost
totally
flat
smell
was
not
much
of
a
presence
either
with
very
light
notes
of
toasted
malt
and
yeast
no
fruit
or
sweetness
in
the
smell
which
aligned
closely
with
the
taste
of
this
beer
not
much
in
the
line
of
flavor
or
mouthfeel
with
little
no
no
carbonation
not
a
beer
i
will
be
trying
again
if
you
drink
this
one
cold
you
will
not
be
able
to
appreciate
the
beer
it
really
comes
together
once
you
allow
it
to
settle

cool

i
am

i
dont
ever
pick
this
up
just
a
very
uniteresting
brew
th
feel
of
this
beer
is
a
nice
crisp
easy
drinking
beer
its
pretty
light
with
some
really
good

not
a
bad
taste
malt
sweet
some

didnt

a

could
be
good
on
a
warmer

easy
drinking
i
would
not
go
so
far
as
to
say
this
is
the
worst
beer
ive
ever
had
that
title
is
reserved
for
natty
ice
but
it
ranks
close
the
export
tastes
like
vinegar
mixed
with
becks
after
my
first
sip
i
immediately
asked
the
bartender
if
the
keg
had
gotten
skunked
or
if
the
lines
hadnt
been
cleaned
since
new
years
he
assured
me
that
this
was
how
the
beer
was
supposed
to
taste
and
so
i
not
being
one
to
waste
beer
choked
it
down
somewhere
amidst
the
sickly
sour
taste
and
ureayellow
coloring
i
found
a
redeeming
quality
to
this
monstrosity
it
goes
great
with
pretzels
something
about
the
salty
tang
of
a
pretzel
counterbalances
the
overly
dry
feel
and
bitter
morningbreath
taste
of
the
export
ale
it
will
be
a
while
before
i
try
one
of
these
again
overall
a
mess
and
not
very
good
put
it
in
a
different
category
and
maybe
it
would
jump
a
little
but
this
fails
as
an
apa
for
me
cant
recommend
rotation
avail
here
but
one
and
done
for
me
this
is
a
good
straightforward
ale
light
golden
yellow
color
a
little
fizzy
but
nothing
a
little
harder
pour
into
the
glass
didnt
take
care
of
lighter
flavor
but
has
a
nice
balance
for
whats
there
nice
little
hop
background
that
comes
through
the
nose
its
drinkable
also
mouthfeel
is
ok
and
drinkability
is
pretty
solid
whoa
taste
is
rich
no
indication
in
the
appearance
the
butteriness
continues
with
an
assertive
malty
backbonepunch
in
the
face
but
tempered
in
tag
fashion
by
the
hops
not
overly
complex
but
rather
intriguing
as
an
apa
not
a
clone
of
anything
the
buttery
mouthfeel
really
makes
it
all
work
quite
drinkable
a
session
apa
for
sure
at
least
for
me
d
by
the
time
this
beer
was
warming
near
the
middle
or
so
it
was
starting
to
taste
almost
as
malty
as
it
was
hoppy
weird
either
way
it
would
be
easy
to
drink
a
couple
of
these
but
theres
many
better
apas
out
there
341
ml
bottle
pours
a
deep
rusty
gold
with
a
frothy
white
cap
nose
of
sugary
grains
and
fruity
malts
some
white
bread
crust
and
grassy
hops
tastes
of
slightly
biter
hops
and
sweet
grains
and
some
sweet
malts
theres
a
hint
of
vanilla
and
rye
too
finishes
sweet
with
a
slightly
metallic
and
bitter
finish
ok
thanks
mom
d
overall
a
clean
not
so
hoppy
beer
that
does
neither
disappoint
nor
stick
out
off
the
tap
at
the
brewery
this
beer
was
a
light
amber
color
with
no
head
to
speak
of
the
offwhite
skim
did
not
retain
well
and
the
lacing
was
also
thin
and
scattered
the
aroma
was
of
sweet
malt
pale
malt
and
a
little
caramel
malt
the
flavors
were
light
and
crisp
dry
graininess
hoppy
bitterness
and
a
drab
macrolike
finish
though
i
would
describe
it
as
a
session
beer
the
finish
really
took
a
lot
away
from
this
beverage
the
mouthfeel
was
a
little
watery
the
body
light
and
the
carbonation
medium
have
enjoyed
this
beer
since
a
trip
to
portland
d
a
great
apa
if
you
enjoy
ringwood
merely
good
otherwise
but
plenty
sessionable
d
pretty
easy
to
drink
at
first
dryness
is
a
large
part
of
it
pours
a
clear
light
amber
color
with
a
thick
med
of
small
to
medium
sized
white
bubbles
there
is
lots
of
visible
carbonation
rising
in
the
glass
some
hops
in
the
aroma
along
with
malt
and
grain
the
export
tastes
buttery
with
some
hop
bitterness
it
finishes
dry
but
due
to
the
butteriness
the
beer
leaves
a
good
amount
of
coating
in
your
mouth
that
lingers
well
after
youve
swallowed
if
you
werent
partial
to
this
feeling
youd
want
a
sip
of
water
after
each
sip
of
beer
the
amount
of
carbonation
also
borders
on
the
upper
end
all
in
all
there
are
some
good
things
and
bad
things
about
shipyard
export
its
a
beer
you
can
find
almost
everywhere
in
my
area
so
if
i
dont
see
something
i
like
i
can
always
order
one
it
still
carries
a
premium
price
though
so
usually
i
can
find
something
a
little
more
interesting
for
the
same
cost
md
the
beer
had
a
light
texture
but
far
too
much
zing
from
the
carbonation
for
my
tastes
d
easily
drinkable
but
not
very
interesting
average
at
best
pours
slightly
hazy
golden
with
offwhite
head
nose
is
rather
weak
with
some
buttery
grain
elements
and
faint
citrus
palate
is
more
citrusysharp
though
still
thin
bodied
and
has
that
buttery
flavor
coming
through
again
finish
is
short
and
has
more
buttery
flavors
on
tap
at
max
and
dylans
near
park
street
served
in
a
standard
pint
glass
yellow
color
well
carbonated
no
lacing
watery
appearance
smell
was
a
tad
musty
taste
was
pretty
average
for
a
pale
ale
it
was
more
malty
than
hoppy
also
i
did
not
prefer
the
slightly
sticky
mouthfeel
while
i
did
not
find
the
taste
overly
appealing
it
was
a
fairly
easy
beer
to
drink
due
to
its
blandness
this
was
more
of
a
beer
to
order
and
drink
instead
of
ordering
to
enjoy
washed
my
appetizers
down
so
it
served
its
purpose
this
beer
is
very
straight
to
the
point
no
bells
or
whistles
great
for
knocking
back
a
few
with
friends
on
a
cold
evening
good
carbonation
and
mouthfeel
very
sessionable
this
beer
pours
a
nice
golden
color
with
a
decent
white
head
there
is
not
a
very
hoppy
aroma
which
is
typical
of
american
pale
ales
the
taste
is
well
balanced
but
seems
to
be
more
like
an
english
pale
ale
than
an
american
pale
ale
i
dont
taste
the
usual
citrusy
hops
found
in
apas
cascade
centennial
amarillo
etc
not
a
bad
beer
overallquite
drinkable
actually
but
i
dont
think
it
compares
with
the
west
coast
apas
i
enjoyed
this
ale
feel
and
drinkability
dry
finish
with
some
maple
tones
leading
up
to
it
and
some
green
hop
flavors
sticking
around
after
medium
bodied
with
medium
carbonation
nothing
wrong
with
how
this
one
feels
this
is
one
thats
easy
to
drink
though
im
not
sure
how
readily
id
pick
it
up
again
its
good
but
it
hasnt
made
it
to
my
regulars
or
fallback
lists
final
thoughts
definitely
a
decent
entry
by
shipyard
overall
enjoyable
and
definitley
one
to
session
drink
is
still
not
to
good
i
really
couldnt
drink
even
two
of
these
d
sits
heavy
in
the
stomach
cant
have
more
than
a
few
good
brerwery
tour
if
you
are
in
the
portland
area
drinkability
a
very
malty
ale
much
more
of
an
english
pale
ale
to
me
decent
malthop
balance
and
relatively
smooth
nothing
to
complain
about
but
nothing
standing
out
might
be
good
for
someone
into
a
malty
ale
but
not
me
mostly
average
for
the
style
d
this
is
a
very
smooth
and
sessionable
beer
i
have
bought
many
a
sixpack
of
this
and
will
buy
many
more
i
have
drifted
away
from
hoppy
beers
over
the
past
year
as
i
got
tired
of
the
constant
extreme
hop
additions
while
interesting
it
became
distracting
led
me
enjoy
more
maltoriented
brews
which
was
quite
enjoyable
to
say
the
least
lately
maybe
because
of
the
hints
of
spring
that
weve
been
teased
with
here
in
boston
i
have
to
say
i
am
enjoying
the
hops
anew
i
thoroughly
enjoyed
the
12
pack
from
shipyard
including
this
goos
basic
american
pale
ale
arguably
not
the
prototype
like
sierra
nevada
others
shipyards
offering
sensibly
to
my
mind
did
not
leave
out
the
malt
element
golden
yellow
pour
to
a
34
finger
white
head
nice
lace
retention
with
a
flowery
hop
yeasty
breadmalt
aroma
slight
apricot
hints
creamy
yet
crisp
with
a
bit
much
carbonation
good
clean
medium
body
taste
very
refreshing
why
is
this
called
an
apa
maybe
my
bottle
is
old
but
ive
got
no
hops
and
almost
no
malt
this
beer
is
all
ringwood
it
appears
a
clear
amber
with
a
white
head
and
lacing
the
flavor
and
aroma
have
a
creamy
sugar
candy
character
with
a
hint
of
fruit
theres
also
a
mild
bready
malt
backbone
that
provides
a
pleasant
contrast
but
for
the
most
part
this
is
a
simple
yeastdriven
beer
one
reviewer
brought
up
pancakes
and
thats
unfortunately
what
i
was
reminded
of
after
i
read
that
call
this
an
english
pale
ale
and
maybe
im
a
little
more
lenient
but
for
my
money
an
apa
better
bring
at
least
half
a
wallop
of
hopping
d
excellent
beer
can
be
enjoyed
with
or
without
food
and
at
any
time
of
the
year
from
a
12
fl
oz
bottle
with
an
expiration
date
of
apr
09
sampled
on
feb
28
2009
i
like
the
way
it
looks
with
its
ultraclear
coppergolden
tone
i
gave
its
appearance
the
highest
grade
not
much
head
though
the
aroma
is
mostly
malty
and
vaguely
hopped
the
mouthfeel
is
medium
and
the
flavor
is
also
quite
malty
and
a
little
fruity
its
a
nice
product
d
decent
not
something
i
would
buy
again
though
poured
from
12oz
bottle
into
pint
glass
pours
a
light
amber
golden
color
with
very
little
head
smells
kind
of
toasty
but
offputting
taste
is
kind
of
toasty
malts
and
unlike
any
other
apa
ive
ever
had
lightmedium
bodied
mouthfeel
drinkable
but
the
toastyness
doesnt
do
well
for
the
style
all
in
all
an
ok
beer
this
is
a
solid
brew
that
i
will
revisit
occasionally
the
flavor
seems
typical
of
an
english
pale
slight
sweetness
immediately
balanced
by
earthy
hop
flavor
and
mild
hop
bitterness
the
biscuit
flavor
is
also
prevalent
mouthfeel
is
ok
slightly
more
carbonated
than
i
would
like
but
has
a
nice
feel
otherwise
there
is
however
a
bit
of
astringency
making
what
would
be
a
nice
session
beer
tough
to
drink
lots
of
a
decent
beer
from
shipyard
worth
checking
out
overall
i
as
a
bit
surprise
by
the
nose
it
seem
every
time
i
went
to
nose
the
beer
it
change
forms
on
me
there
is
a
slight
chalky
powdery
mouth
feel
the
finish
is
bitter
and
it
lingers
for
a
bit
on
the
palate
it
is
not
a
great
beer
but
it
is
better
than
most
the
shipyard
brewing
co
makes
a
variety
of
different
beers
but
once
youve
tried
one
youve
more
or
less
had
them
all
the
taste
is
similar
across
the
board
the
export
ale
was
the
first
that
i
tried
growing
up
in
maine
and
it
pours
a
typical
light
brownish
color
with
a
bubbly
head
it
is
definitely
possible
to
smell
the
hops
immediately
after
pouring
and
that
is
the
predominant
taste
as
well
i
would
recommend
shipyard
to
those
looking
to
enjoy
a
nice
easy
ale
especially
when
visiting
maine
and
looking
to
pair
your
beverage
with
seafood
this
brew
is
by
no
means
offensive
and
they
use
fine
malts
from
the
weyermann
factory
in
bamberg
germany
d
on
the
other
hand
very
easy
to
drink
d
pretty
good
i
havent
seen
this
beer
around
here
much
but
id
def
pick
up
some
again
i
usually
drink
export
on
tap
and
in
my
opinion
i
think
the
bottled
version
is
a
bit
mellower
with
the
tap
having
a
wee
bit
more
hop
bite
this
is
one
of
my
standard
go
to
beers
that
i
feel
comfortable
offering
a
guests
who
simply
ask
for
a
beer
i
enjoy
most
of
the
products
that
shipyard
produces
wish
it
had
a
greater
distribution
range
a
bit
hard
to
find
here
in
nj
i
hated
their
ipa
but
the
export
wasnt
so
bad
it
had
much
more
flavor
and
was
actually
hoppy
in
comparison
i
poured
this
one
into
a
piraat
tulip
glass
the
head
was
light
the
body
was
decent
and
the
taste
was
very
palatable
i
could
see
myself
drinking
this
beer
all
day
i
wish
i
had
found
this
beer
earlier
in
the
summer
it
would
be
a
decent
session
beer
not
a
beer
id
buy
again
yellow
in
color
and
topped
with
a
fluffy
tan
head
retention
is
quite
good
theres
a
rolling
lacing
left
all
around
the
glass
theres
some
hop
aromas
subtle
fruits
and
some
esters
tastes
a
little
spicy
with
the
hops
being
a
bit
more
present
to
the
palate
than
the
nose
malts
are
definitely
present
some
fruit
and
honey
are
in
the
mix
as
well
a
quick
swirl
results
in
very
little
carbonation
its
very
lightbodied
going
down
with
a
little
chalky
aftertaste
a
few
drinks
in
no
complaints
here
this
beer
poured
a
decent
yellowgold
color
with
pillowey
head
that
dissapated
relatively
quickly
no
lacing
to
speak
of
there
was
not
much
of
an
aroma
the
aroma
was
a
little
sweet
but
not
too
much
the
taste
was
faintly
sweet
from
the
malt
with
some
fruity
background
this
beer
isnt
a
beer
that
completely
wows
you
but
it
is
a
good
beer
that
isnt
all
that
memorable
this
brew
was
the
typical
orangish
color
that
you
would
expect
from
a
apa
but
the
head
looked
too
thin
there
was
a
decent
hop
presence
in
the
nose
as
well
as
a
mild
bite
in
the
taste
however
it
wasnt
nearly
as
hoppy
as
i
would
have
expected
this
brew
just
didnt
really
seem
like
an
apa
to
me
there
was
a
very
mild
malty
sweetness
after
the
mild
hop
burst
it
maybe
had
a
toasted
malt
character
that
seemed
more
like
an
aggressive
red
not
bad
but
just
not
what
i
had
anticipated
i
thought
this
was
by
far
the
best
of
the
4
in
the
pack
a
nice
solid
beer
here
great
smell
nice
hoppy
taste
and
smooth
finish
also
not
too
high
in
abv
so
you
can
easily
put
a
few
back
i
would
definitely
come
back
to
this
one
bought
a
sampler
pack
the
drink
had
a
wicked
good
sized
head
almost
an
inch
thick
clear
crisp
orangeamber
appearance
with
bubbly
lacing
aromas
were
pretty
darn
good
spiced
hops
very
subtly
aromic
taste
had
a
hint
of
honey
to
it
sweeting
the
hoppy
doughy
flavoring
mouthfeel
gives
it
a
good
crispness
but
it
does
have
a
slight
overwatered
texture
to
it
overall
decently
refreshing
pale
ale
sampled
out
of
the
bottle
i
didnt
like
it
golden
colored
topped
with
a
decent
foamy
offwhite
head
spotty
lacing
malts
dominate
the
hops
here
with
some
caramel
honey
and
oats
tilts
too
heavy
on
the
malts
for
my
liking
a
little
syrupy
as
well
too
bad
i
didnt
like
it
has
a
strange
off
flavor
kind
of
a
weirdly
sour
sweet
taste
in
the
middle
of
the
mouth
kinda
funny
beer
im
hoping
i
somehow
got
a
weird
one
because
well
its
not
my
cup
o
nice
refreshing
brew
i
really
enjoyed
having
a
few
of
these
during
the
warm
spring
season
pours
a
light
copperdirty
yellow
color
with
a
nice
thick
head
and
a
good
amount
of
lacing
the
aroma
is
malty
with
a
strong
bread
scent
mild
hops
seem
to
be
present
a
nice
full
mouthfeel
is
pleasing
on
the
palate
the
flavor
is
surprisingly
crisp
and
really
seemed
to
quench
my
thirst
strong
sweet
malt
presence
backed
by
some
mellow
hops
there
is
a
mild
buttery
taste
that
is
hit
or
miss
with
this
one
overall
it
is
rather
enjoyable
once
in
a
while
pretty
darn
good
taste
though
and
extremely
easy
to
drink
its
less
hoppy
than
most
pale
ales
smooth
and
buttery
going
down
nice
summer
beer
good
for
relaxing
an
easydrinking
pale
ale
but
none
too
exciting
or
unique
perhaps
this
was
a
good
alternative
to
macro
lagers
in
the
area
upper
new
england
at
the
time
it
was
founded
but
in
modern
times
i
would
consider
it
quite
average
you
can
knock
these
back
easily
because
here
isnt
one
disinct
flavor
that
jumps
out
at
you
just
had
one
after
painting
outside
for
4
hours
refreshing
not
filling
not
overpowering
decent
but
nothing
id
go
out
of
my
way
for
but
wouldnt
refuse
on
either

there
are

in

its
not

d
definitely
drinkable
i
will
having
this
beer
again
and
look
forward
to
trying
others
from
shipyard
fairly
thick
for
the
style
and
uniquely
centered
around
a
slightly
bready
less
sweet
malt
over
your
normal

i
like

ale
with
plenty
of
flavorit
would
be
hard
not
to
drink
another
if
i
had
one
not
my
beer
of
choice
as
far
as
the
drinkability
goes
but
id
still
take
anohter
d
tasty
goes
down
easily
not
too
filling
mild
kick
decent
representation
of
style
its
nothing
out
of
the
ordinary
but
its
a
good
solid
beer
to
drink
for
while
d
easy
drinking
but
not
much
more
than
an
ordinary
brew
the
taste
has
a
good
balance
of
malt
and
hops
sweetness
and
bitterness
it
has
elements
of
bread
honey
a
hints
of
earthy
pine
and
citrus
giving
a
fairly
crisp
finish
and
nice
lingering
flavour
md
heavy
and
full
flavored
again
more
so
than
you
might
think
just
by
looking
at
it
the
carbonation
was
well
matched
with
fine
abundant
bubbles
licking
back
the
brew
wasnt
a
stunner
by
any
means
but
it
is
a
great
general
purpose
beer
that
i
would
love
to
sample
again
someday
soon
i
would
never
purchase
or
drink
this
beer
again
this
is
one
of
the
worst
beers
ive
ever
reviewed
i
dont
think
it
had
anything
to
do
with
storage
or
transport
because
i
bought
a
variety
pack
and
the
other
2
types
of
beer
in
it
were
exceptional
shipyard
is
usually
good
but
they
missed
the
mark
here
by
a
lot
d
highly
drinkable
this
is
a
fine
session
beer
the
best
thing
about
this
beer
is
that
it
goes
down
very
smooth
and
doesntleave
you
parched
it
quenches
your
thirst
and
leaves
not
fruityhoppy
aftertaste
in
your
mouth
that
you
dont
want
overall
a
decent
beer
but
i
have
to
say
it
isnt
worth
a
purchase
of
a
six
pack
wow
100
and
im
drinking
shipyard
export
ale
no
offense
to
this
beer
but
with
a
decent
cellar
i
think
i
should
have
celebrated
with
a
different
beer
but
onto
the
review
poured
a
12oz
bottle
into
a
smokestack
goblet
aroma
is
nondescript
nothing
special
but
nothing
outstanding
either
though
i
was
expecting
a
bit
of
hops
in
the
aroma
taste
is
about
the
same
faint
hint
of
smoke
maybe
just
roasted
malts
wheat
and
just
a
bit
of
hops
im
stretching
when
i
say
bit
mouthfeel
is
about
average
its
drinkable
nothing
special
meh
pours
a
perfectly
clear
yellowgold
in
color
with
a
full
2
fingers
of
soapy
longlasting
head
aroma
is
quite
faint
but
pleasant
dominated
by
a
slightly
caramel
maltiness
with
only
mere
hints
of
hops
taste
is
at
first
much
like
the
aroma
very
malty
and
somewhat
sweet
towards
the
finish
however
hops
suddenly
appear
mostly
citrusy
and
spicy
not
overwhelming
but
they
contrast
rather
starkly
against
the
overwhelming
maltiness
into
the
finish
there
is
a
good
amount
of
bitterness
in
the
late
finish
and
into
the
after
taste
i
can
detect
some
honey
notes
mouthfeel
is
good
lightmedium
body
with
moderate
carbonation
drinkability
is
good
as
well
this
is
a
solid
apa
but
more
malty
than
hoppy
pours
a
fogged
strawgold
what
gives
a
decent
whiteish
head
that
falls
rather
quickly
nose
is
boring
flavor
is
earthy
and
leafy
with
a
sweet
tone
minor
citrus
not
very
interesting
or
complex
but
well
rounded
enough
feel
is
decent
low
soft
carbonation
on
a
average
liquid
body
very
easy
to
drink
and
certainly
a
possible
session
brew
rereview
july
2008
the
beer
definitely
has
a
buttery
diacetyl
taste
to
it
actually
the
buttery
malt
lingers
a
bit
too
much
and
leaves
a
slightly
oily
mouthfeel
in
its
wake
i
still
like
the
cracked
barley
taste
to
the
beer
but
the
diacetyl
is
a
bit
more
than
i
care
for
im
knocking
this
down
a
peg
another
bottle
copped
singly
from
total
wine
and
more
in
west
orange
was
a
huge
fan
of
shipyards
pumpkin
ale
as
this
is
considered
their
flagship
beer
it
is
a
overall
good
sample
that
goes
down
smooth
and
is
very
easy
to
drink
nice
ambercopper
appearance
with
slight
carbonation
present
smell
is
very
bready
with
hints
of
caramel
and
butter
taste
compliments
the
aroma
with
a
slightly
malty
bread
and
butter
finish
and
slight
bitterness
that
lingers
on
the
palate
good
mouthfeel
and
easy
drinkability
make
this
a
good
sociable
session
beer
a
classic
american
brew
recommended
for
shipyards
flagship
beer
im
sure
they
could
do
better
or
at
least
improve
it
to
make
it
stand
out
as
is
though
its
a
bit
bland
in
the
taste
department
wet
and
thirstquenching
but
with
a
dry
bready
finish
highly
quaffable
a
very
good
session
bitter
sweeter
than
normal
but
wellbalanced
and
smooth

goes

easy
and
quick

conceal

of
earthiness
and
oranges

almost
acidic
touch
of

light
to

spicy

top
is
light
to
medium
in
feel
finish
has
an
understated

presence
acidity
stinging
dry
as
they
come
it
starts
off
promising
with
its
appearance
bright
pale
blonde
with
a
big
crackling
head
odd
aroma
of
sour
grains
and
a
touch
of
grapefruit
the
flavor
is
alright
but
hints
of
ink
spoil
part
of
it
a
touch
of
herbal
and
kissed
with
citrus
all
tied
to
a
mild
astringency
i
tried
to
like
it
but
i
didnt
its
light
enough
to
drink
easy
but
that
damn
inktasting
offflavor
takes
a
lot
of
will
to
consume
enjoyed
on
tap
at
the
marriott
hotel
in
south
portland
maine
this
was
a
bright
and
clear
deep
golden
color
brew
with
just
a
whisp
of
a
white
cover
and
very
fine
lacing
that
held
nicely
the
aroma
is
a
pleasant
but
subtle
lemon
cookie
dough
deal
the
flavor
is
also
clean
and
easy
enough
to
drink
multiple
sample
it
has
a
bready
citruswheat
flavor
clean
a
bit
acqueous
with
kind
flimsy
carbonation
this
might
appeal
to
any
beer
drinker
fairly
mild
and
refreshing
but
generally
unspectacular
and
forgettable
billed
as
a
canadian
style
ale
pours
a
light
yellow
very
dry
and
lightly
malty
crisp
clean
finish
tastes
like
many
canadian
beers
ive
had
that
is
to
say
its
good
but
not
great
d
simple
and
good
definitely
sessionable
and
worthy
of
another
tasting
or
two
solid
contribution
to
the
lighter
side
of
the
pale
ale
cheers
had
this
on
draught
at
the
emerald
coast
brew
fest
in
pensacola
fl
poured
an
attractive
golden
color
with
a
decent
head
that
didnt
last
too
long
somewhat
of
a
fruit
aroma
though
not
real
distinctive
taste
was
a
bit
fruity
with
a
bit
of
a
hoppy
finish
this
was
nothing
special
but
was
decent
and
inoffensive
drinkability
was
pretty
good
a
very
average
beer
nothing
special
at
all
here
this
beer
poured
a
clear
golden
color
with
a
thick
head
there
was
a
steady
stream
of
bubbles
from
the
bottom
of
the
glass
the
aroma
was
initially
hoppy
but
became
more
sweet
and
malty
as
it
sat
the
taste
is
malty
and
sweet
with
a
slight
bitter
hops
finish
the
mouthfeel
is
medium
to
full
overall
i
like
this
brew
and
consider
it
worthy
of
another
d
an
ok
if
somewhat
boring
session
brew
that
exhibits
a
very
british
restraint
and
mellow
character
that
metallic
mineral
well
water
flavor
can
get
on
my
nerves
a
bit
i
wont
be
having
this
again
overall
a
decent
beer
when
your
options
are
limited
overall
not
to
my
taste
fairly
easy
to
drink
but
just
nothing
there
to
really
hook
me
i
will
take
some
of
the
blame
in
assuming
a
beer
called
export
ale
was
going
to
be
on
the
heavier
side
i
drank
it
review
accordingly
then
log
on
and
find
out
its
a
pale
ale
oh
well
bland
even
for
a
pale
in
my
opinion
beer
pours
a
nice
pale
color
with
some
carbonation
that
lingers
mild
fruity
aroma
with
malt
detectable
taste
is
somewhat
bitterish
with
more
of
an
alcohol
taste
and
not
too
much
of
other
flavors
detectable
malt
backbone
shows
through
overall
an
interesting
take
on
a
pale
ale
but
nothing
that
impresses
me
much
eh
pretty
bland
offering
and
not
something
id
turn
to
again

very

miss
with

bottle
poured
a
golden
brown
color
ale
with
a
small
bubbly
head
that
disappeared
a
bit
too
quickly
aroma
of
rough
barley
with
this
weird
shipyard
yeast
which
doesnt
really
fit
my
taste
buds
taste
of
rough
grain
and
yeasty
finish
dont
really
get
me
excited
and
leave
me
wondering
where
this
is
going
average
body
with
some
adequate
carbonation
i
recently
went
through
quite
a
few
beers
from
those
folks
and
i
didnt
find
anything
that
excited
me
well
made
stuff
drinkability
for
as
bitter
beer
as
it
is
still
suprisingly
drinkable
pleasant

more
than
one

pretty

but
it
isnt

protypical

drinkable
i
never
seen
this
and
then
in
the
past
2
days
i
seen
it
twice
i
would
buy
this
again
i
enjoyed
this
one
a
lot
i
poured
into
a
pint
glass
light
rust
color
with
a
foamy
head
that
didnt
last
long
and
had
little
lacing
smelled
of
grains
and
a
slight
alcohol
scent
tasted
slightly
sweet
some
grains
and
a
subtle
taste
of
corn
a
good
brew
overall
not
extraordinary
but
something
that
goes
down
smooth
and
easy
to
drink
a
very
strong
maine
brewing
company
an
okay
brew
for
a
light
pale
ale
nothing
special
inoffensive
too
light
in
body
and
flavor
but
not
a
bad
choice
for
something
that
is
easy
to
drink
with
some
flavor
regardless
thin
mouthfeel
and
astringent
alcohol
taste
aside
it
went
down
well
and
was
great
with
food
ill
still
use
my
shipyard
glasses
and
ill
still
love
the
logo
but
shipyard
export
is
one
of
those
things
ill
only
try
onceinawhile
just
to
see
how
the
formula
changes
over
time
im
not
a
big
pa
fan
but
i
do
enjoy
them
with
food
particularly
stereotypical
bar
food
this
was
paired
with
a
8oz
loaded
burger
fries
and
was
excellent
with
it
i
did
find
this
shipyard
offering
to
be
enjoyable
and
i
would
certainly
enjoy
it
again
especially
if
paired
with
a
good
sandwich
fries
pours
a
light
amber
color
with
a
big
bubbly
head
that
settles
down
rather
quickly
aromas
of
mild
hops
grain
and
some
butterscotch
the
mouthfeel
is
watery
and
almost
what
youd
expect
from
some
macros
i
used
to
really
like
this
beer
but
my
opinion
of
it
has
gone
down
over
the
years
its
a
little
better
on
tap
this
is
probably
the
only
beer
i
can
think
of
where
the
cask
version
had
the
same
or
less
flavor
than
the
original
that
was
dissapointing
overall
this
is
a
good
session
beer
for
me
but
there
are
much
better
beers
to
be
had
from
shipyard
a
very
satisfying
beer
and
definitely
a
good
choice
for
a
session
beer
pours
golden
with
white
head
with
really
small
bubbles
it
leaves
some
lacing
on
the
sides
of
the
glass
aroma
is
grainy
with
hop
aroma
aroma
is
malty
with
some
fruit
and
hop
bitterness
medium
bodied
bitterness
lingers
in
the
finish
drinkability
is
ok
this
is
a
nice
beer
ugh
i
gotta
admit
not
impressed
transparent
straw
color
with
simple
disappearing
head
pine
hop
aroma
with
similar
tase
but
has
a
spoiled
sweetbitter
flavor
perhaps
this
bottle
was
not
taken
care
of
properly
but
i
would
rather
have
water
than
this
again
has
this
stale
aftertaste
and
seems
improperly
carbonated
just
kinda
off
in
general
ill
pass
decent
beer
nothing
to
write
home
about
spend
that
7
somewhere
else
bham
uk
shipyard
export
ale
is
crisp
and
clean
with
a
flavor
profile
that
is
balanced
overall
it
is
a
raw
no
frills
type
of
ale
with
no
one
dominant
flavor
its
not
perfect
but
i
still
like
the
overall
taste
it
seems
like
a
good
basic
all
around
ale
for
consumption
with
food
on
the
back
porch
or
during
a
football
game
overall
a
nice
solid
ale
d
ok
not
a
bad
purchase
but
theres
tons
of
better
beers
out
there
i
cant
quite
put
a
finger
on
why
i
dont
like
this
but
the
flavors
mix
together
in
a
somewhat
harsh
way
my
least
favorite
of
the
shipyard
line
i
remember
when
i
was
in
some
bar
in
georgetown
ct
and
actually
seeing
it
on
tap
happt
happy
joy
joy
an
all
around
good
drinking
beer
m
purchased
plaza
liquors
tucson
az
a
lovely
gold
almost
amber
colour
with
a
lace
head
smell
the
malt
a
refreshing
aroma
with
a
touch
of
fruit
that
seems
to
appear
in
the
mouth
feel
i
liked
this
pale
ale
i
always
prefer
a
pale
ale
over
a
lager
and
this
hit
the
spot
maybe
it
was
cause
i
drank
the
first
three
while
sitting
on
my
veranda
on
a
warm
sunny
afternoon
the
aftertaste
was
just
a
touch
into
the
bitter
zone
just
right
for
a
warm
sunny
afternoon
for
those
of
us
in
the
border
provinces
of
canada
it
is
sometimes
frustratingly
difficult
to
try
beers
from
neighbouring
states
because
of
the
laws
governing
our
impoting
of
foreign
brew
so
to
my
fellow
new
brunswickers
let
me
say
that
this
ale
is
not
in
the
top
fifty
but
a
good
ale
that
comes
recommended
for
those
who
want
to
experience
a
local
brew
when
passing
through
maine
on
the
way
home
pours
a
golden
amber
color
with
white
sticky
head
aroma
is
buttery
with
a
spicey
herbal
hop
and
malt
i
for
one
am
a
fan
of
diacetyl
but
it
is
one
of
those
you
love
it
or
hate
it
buttery
malt
dominate
the
taste
with
not
much
hops
to
speak
of
overall
this
is
a
pretty
decent
brew
that
i
wont
mind
having
again
an
all
malt
midstream
american
pale
ale
good
for
quaffing
and
sessions
12

pours
a
nice
golden
amber
color
with
a
small
head
and
retention
with
little
or
no
lacing
poured
from
a
bottle
into
a
pint
glass
it
has
a
very
fruity
malty
smell
to
it
this
is
a
fairly
tasty
beer
but
nothing
too
special
it
has
a
good
deal
of
fruity
malts
with
a
decent
balance
of
hoppy
bitterness
in
between
light
and
moderate
on
the
palate
with
a
good
amount
of
carbonation
goes
down
fairly
well
and
tastes
pretty
good
a
very
drinkable
beer
tasty
but
nothing
too
out
of
the
ordinary
feels
nice
n
active
on
the
palate
great
for
washing
down
a
great
friedscalop
dinner
yum
lightbodied
and
refreshing
but
too
watery
good
backyard
beer
if
nothing
else
tastes
like
its
trying
to
be
a
british
pale
but
without
the
balance
or
complexity
not
horrible
but
not
really
recommended
either
unless
you
can
find
a
single
for
about
a
buck
or
so
notes
a
decent
pale
ale
nothing
extraordinary
wouldnt
go
out
of
my
way
to
drink
it
but
its
not
offensive
either
i
cant
believe
its
not
butterbut
it
is
total
drain
pour
here
im
glad
i
only
bought
a
single
and
im
glad
trader
joes
only
charged
85
cents
even
at
that
price
it
wasnt
worth
it
hell
at
least
bud
light
will
deliver
a
clean
crisp
taste
without
the
diacetyl
this
beer
is
a
perfect
example
of
why
ringwood
yeast
cant
be
trusted
in
the
hands
of
any
brewer
other
than
an
expert
drinkability
not
really
that
good
overall
this
beer
is
too
thin
and
mild
there
isnt
enough
boldness
or
complexity
to
hold
my
attention
lingering
buttery
flavor
becomes
distracting
over
time
overall
just
cant
get
past
the
off
flavors
would
definitly
avoid
in
the
future
i
can
see
the
homage
to
british
style
beers
shipyard
tends
to
make
but
ive
been
to
england
and
even
the
most
dyed
in
the
wool
british
pubster
would
have
a
hard
time
with
the
amount
of
butter
in
this
beer
it
dominates
all
else
pour
was
a
bit
flat
but
not
upsetting
given
the
style
hop
nose
was
nonexistent
and
the
malt
character
was
weak
at
best
given
its
deep
gold
color
also
how
can
they
call
it
and
american
pale
ale
when
it
taste
far
more
like
something
from
yorkshire
do
they
brew
with
the
square
or
is
their
ringwood
just
really
lazy
a
bigger
disappointment
is
that
i
had
it
at
federal
jacks
birthplace
of
shipyard
drinkability
averagegood
presentation
packaged
in
a
twelve
ounce
brown
glass
longneck
bottle
with
a
twistoff
crown
served
in

standard
pint
tap
glass
drinkability
and
notes
a
great
session
beer
wouldnt
have
a
problem
drinking
a
few
of
them
really
doesnt
stand
out
in
any
respect
but
holds
strong
in
its
simplicity
i
found
this
beer
to
be
a
very
good
session
beer
it
was
not
heavy
at
all
the
color
was
good
as
was
the
smell
i
would
highly
recommend
this
beer
to
any
of
my
beer
drinking
friends
i
got
the
export
ale
in
what
is
called
the
captains
collection
this
is
a
12
pack
of
different
shipyard
beers
i
am
now
trying
to
get
a
case
of
the
beer
since
it
was
so
good
d
ill
finish
this
one
but
wont
buy
it
again
decent
enough
i
suppose
cheers
shipyard
makes
some
decent
beers
this
isnt
one
of
them
it
was
a
nice
orange
color
with
a
small
head
and
some
lacing
it
had
a
sweet
grainy
odor
the
taste
left
a
lot
to
be
desired
it
was
mildly
hoppy
but
the
bitterness
was
not
pleasant
mouthfeel
was
very
thin
drinkable
in
that
it
will
quench
your
thirst
edit

dissappointed
that
the
only
american
micro
i
bring
home
is
available
here
sessionable
but
only
average
for
a
craft
brew
this
shipyard
offering
pours
a
pale
amber
with
a
frothy
white
head
that
is
very
sturdy
it
has
an
uncomplex
aroma
slightly
hoppy
with
a
mild
barley
sweetness
had
a
slight
bitter
taste
something
i
didnt
expect
from
the
aroma
a
decent
offering
worth
a
shot
not
bad
but
not
my
favorite
very
crisp
in
the
mouth
almost
no
aftertaste

which
would
be
nice
with
the
pa
for
an
afternoon
drinker
this
is
ok
this
pale
ale
is
nothing
fancy
at
all
very
light
and
simple
nearly
no
hops
and
not
too
exciting
the
flavor
does
not
do
it
for
me
very
tart
with
more
grassy
hops
a
pleasant
hop
tingle
mingles
with
some
slight
carbonation
medium
body
some
sugary
sweetness
comes
out
as
it
warms
sticky
finish
with
tannin
notes
something
about
the
hop
flavor
is
off
here
and
the
beer
lacks
cohesion
i
dont
want
another
one
of
these
notes
nothing
really
bad
or
faulty
with
this
beer
however
it
doesnt
really
appeal
to
me
as
its
not
very
flavorful
reminds
me
more
of
the
golden
ales
offered
as
a
choice
at
brewpubs
than
an
apa
this
beer
pours
a
light
amber
color
from
a
brown
twelve
ounce
bottle
with
a
head
that
dissipated
quickly
i
dont
detect
any
off
flavors
in
the
aroma
but
i
find
the
taste
to
be
disappointing
definitely
some
butterscotch
in
there
i
wouldnt
say
there
is
anything
really
wrong
with
this
beer
but
in
my
opinion
there
really
isnt
much
to
recommend
it
either
i
dont
care
much
for
it
i
wont
be
purchasing
this

picked

a

a

slight

a

go
but
this
one
is
easy

not

about
with
this
one
a
good

and
one
just
to
relax
and
enjoy
an
exceptionally
easytodrink
fruity
east
coast
pale
ale
not
terribly
exciting
but
tasty
just
the
same
a
good
mouthfeel
however
makes
this

rather
quaffable
an
inexpensive
alternative
to
the
macros
at

cheers

this

has
a
buttery

with

pretty
good
taste
with
the
buttery
malts
detected
in
the
aroma
making
a
return
in
the
flavor
with
spicy

bitterness
in
the
showing
up
in
the
end
tastey
brew
could
more
than
a
few
down
in
one
sitting
this
is
the
best
shipyard
has
to
over
imo
overall
a
fair
ale
but
nothing
to
rush
out
and
try
a
very
drinkable
beer
its
nothing
exciting
but
we
need
nice
unabrasive
beers
around
too
well
done
a
nice
honey
colorbut
a
weak
small
head
that
disappears
quickly
a
nice
hoppy
smell
with
a

a
real
hoppy
tastevery
dry
this
is
a
light
good
summer
beergood
for
bbq
not
a
bad
offering
from
shipyardi
wont
mind
having
more
than
one
at
a
ballgame
a
pleasant
not
too
complex
ale
here
i
wouldnt
pick
this
over
a
snpa
though
clean
crisp
upfront
close
to
medium
bodied
but
takes
a
turn
towards
off
dryness
and
minerallike
chalkyness
the
rest
of
the
way
as
well
as
empty
areas
very
plain
and
poor
attempt
at
an
apa
far
too
dry
and
unbalanced
with
hardly
a
taste
factor
to
it
a
golden
orange
color
a
firm
laceproducing
white
head
great
herbal
aroma
at
first
glance
this
is
a
solid
brew
slight
malt
aroma
and
decent
caramel
and
toasted
malt
foretaste
then
theres
a
huge
astringent
quality
that
kicks
in
i
wasnt
expecting
the
beer
to
dry
out
as
much
as
it
did
and
to
present
a
chalky
metallic
characteristic
bitterness
follows
its
highly
carbonated
and
ends
abruptly
its
an
above
average
brewbut
at
least
in
my
book
its
not
a
standout
serving
type
is
a
brown
bottle
with
freshness
date
this
beer
pours
a
classic
golden
color
with
about
a
12
inch
white
head
smell
is
mostly
malty
with
buried
hops
a
biy
cirtrusy
also
has
some
hints
of
oak
this
is
a
light
tomedium
bodied
beer
also
has
very
minimal
lacing
a
bit
sticky
in
the
mouth
but
goes
down
easy
enough
all
around
about
average
nice
hop
bitterness
and
malt
balance
very
drinkable
with
an
average
mouthfeel
seems
there
could
have
been
more
fruitiness
from
the
hop
aroma
a
tasty
beverage
from
the
beaver
state
definitely
give
it
another
go
round
malts
anchored
this
brew
some
metallic
no
bitterness
that
i
could
detect
although
it
had
enough
hops
to
finish
clean
there
was
actually
some
warming
which
surprised
me
as
its
5
but
it
comes
through
and
helps
this
beer
along
i
liked
the
backend
sweetness
that
is
cemented
by
a
crispness
to
cleanse
the
palate
i
think
this
beer
could
grow
on
me
this
beer
pours
a
crisp
golden
yellow
the
head
is
white
it
appears
quite
fluffy
and
fades
very
slowly
leaving
thick
laces
it
has
a
citrusy
aroma
it
smells
slightly
piney
it
has
an
aroma
that
i
can
not
define
but
it
is
not
all
that
appealing
it
might
be
murphys
wood
conditioner
it
has
a
cirtusy
flavor
it
is
slightly
bitter
but
not
as
much
as
i
expcted
it
has
a
very
slight
biscuty
taste
it
also
is
slightly
malty
ultimately
i
am
unimpressed
with
the
flavor
of
this
beer
it
is
too
mild
i
think
it
needs
to
be
about
doubled
in
bitterness
that
would
help
this
beer
is
carbonated
well
it
goes
down
smooth
leaving
almost
no
aftertaste
this
beer
might
not
be
a
good
session
beer
because
it
doesnt
taste
good
i
doubt
that
i
would
want
to
drink
any
more
of
this
beer
ever
it
is
not
awful
but
just
not
worth
your
money
or
time
this
beer
pours
a
very
clear
straw
color
with
a
small
white
head
that
fizzles
out
pretty
quick
the
smell
is
cornlike
and
lacking
the
flavor
or
also
cornlike
with
some
sweetness
a
little
bit
medicinal
it
is
not
very
complex
the
mouthfeel
is
alright
lightmedium
body
with
medium
carbonation
average
drinkability
its
an
o
k
beer
good
for
a
night
of
heavier
drinking
and
you
dont
care
about
diminishing
your
supply
of
these
this
is
a
very
flavorful
beer
nicely
copper
and
a
touch
darker
than
im
used
to
in
an
apa
smells
sweetly
spicy
sweetly
fruity
in
a
perfume
and
refreshing
way
light
hopping
and
subtle
tastes
moderately
sweet
of
fruits
peaches
pears
plumbs
and
pumpkin
sweet
spices
like
corriander
and
ginger
add
a
summertime
refreshing
flavor
sweet
fruits
and
spices
round
out
nicely
body
is
firm
but
lighter
than
expected
makes
for
an
easy
drinker
finishes
in
a
sweeping
way
a
quick
finish
but
not
abruptly
crisp
or
dry
just
sweet
and
fleeting
very
nice
im
surprised
that
i
have
not
reviewed
the
export
ale
yet
since
shipyard
is
a
summer
staple
for
our
family
nonetheless
i
picked
up
a
captains
collection
recently
ostensibly
to
get
my
hand
on
the
chamberlain
pale
ale
but
i
get
two
reviews
now
the
export
pours
a
light
amber
topped
off
with
a
foamy
thick
offwhite
head
the
aroma
is
of
pine
and
is
slightly
citrusy
but
the
taste
is
rather
different
fairly
bland
some
rose
hips
with
a
yeasty
aftertaste
the
carbonation
quotient
is
high
and
the
mouthfeel
is
thin
this
is
a
light
brew
good
for
summer
id
say
smoothe
mouthfeel
though
very
light
the
carbination
makes
it
a
little
tougher
to
drink
enjoy
slowly
overall
decent
enough
session
brew
i
guess
but
not
one
id
like
to
try
again
pretty
run
of
the
mill
bland
apa
export
ale
is
way
too
ringwoodintensive
for
me
even
though
it
isnt
horrible
anyone
who
drinks
this
stuff
better
have
a
high
diacetyl
tolerance
i
only
bought
a
single
bottle
if
i
had
another
id
put
it
in
the
cupboard
next
to
the
bottle
of
mrs
butterworths
so
itd
be
handy
the
next
time
i
get
a
hankering
for
a
tall
stack
lighter
in
body
lightly
crisp
at
the
start
with
a
smooth
and
relatively
clean
finish
decently
drinkable
not
a
bad
brew
it
kind
of
has
a
unique
flavor
yellowamber
color
filtered
to
transparency
thin
head
that
fades
quickly
some
lace
cling
but
nothing
amazing
rich
malt
smell
butter
maybe
and
light
dough
with
floral
notes
taste
is
balanced
with
malt
sweet
and
buttery
at
first
then
hops
slowly
take
over
and
slowly
diminsh
to
leave
a
citrusy
finish
the
thin
mouthfeel
is
the
weakest
aspect
of
this
brew
needs
more
body
otherwise
it
qualifies
as
a
decent
anglostyle
american
beer
you
can
down
in
quantitity
get
a
couple
six
packs
and
some
friends
and
session
it
up
or
get
a
better
maine
beer
better
than
the
macros
canadian
golden
ale
some
yeast
malts
and
hops
are
there
mostly
in
aroma
and
also
in
taste

at

not
a

but
not

good
either
this
was
a
good
session
beer
i
enjoyed
sipping
it
waiting
for
the
plane
no
complaints
for
this
beer
but
nothing
that
stands
out
pours
a
clear
yellow
gold
color
head
is
good
initially
but
short
lived
taste
is
alright
lightly
hopped
sweet
and

drinkable
a
good
outdoors

beer
if
you
can
find
a
bargain
price
deep
gold
color
with
a
fairly
decent
head
that
slowly
sizzles
down
malty
nose
and
a
buttery
rich
malty
flavor
that
is
adequately
balanced
with
hops
aftertaste
is
slightly
bittersweet
overall
effect
is
that
this
a
fairly
quaffable
session
beer
but
is
unremarkable
there
is
better
ales
out
there
anyway
there
are
also
some
hops
in
the
tail
end
of
it
very
strong
diacetyl
though
nice
aroma
slightly
worse
taste
a
decent
brew
but
not
the
best
example
of
a
pale
ale
drinkability
this
one
surprised
me
with
its
depth
of
character
last
summer
in
maine
i
had
some
bad
experiences
with
a
couple
of
new
england
breweries
that
used
ringwood
yeast
shipyard
and
magic
hat
were
notable
exceptions
and
export
ale
has
convinced
me
that
ringwood
yeast
can
be
extraordinary
when
used
properly
export
ale
is
delicious
feels
wonderful
and
is
highly
drinkable
geeez
im
ready
to
go
back
to
maine
even
if
it
is
a
20
hour
drive
a
good
drinkable
beer
that
would
work
great
a
a
bbq
or
football
game
ontap
at
brian
borus
a
nice
golden
colour
with
an
eggshell
colourd
head
of
frothy
foam
aromas
of
sweet
malts
and
light
green
hops
the
taste
is
nice
but
very
subdued
some
biscuity
malts
and
light
hopping
are
evident
the
mouthfeel
is
medium
light
and
the
drinkability
is
slightly
above
average
a
good
session
drinker
and
a
good
burger
beer
nice
clear
and
golden
honey
very
still
the
offwhite
head
went
away
quickly
leaving
tight
bubbles
in
a
ring
with
a
dusting
but
no
real
retention
nice
malty
scents
with
a
lot
of
caramel
sweetness
punching
through
that
makes
me
think
of
cotton
candy
a
lot
of
carbonation
in
the
feel
bit
foamy
just
a
bit
too
much
for
me
dark
toasty
flavors
with
some
hops
coming
though
bit
of
bitterness
left
on
your
tongue
some
gin
in
there
fairly
astringent
not
too
much
screaming
out
at
me
but
this
would
be
a
damn
good
lawnmower
beer
i
like
this
beer
nothing
terribly
exciting
but
its
good
and
it
really
strikes
me
as
different
its
quite
unique
tasting
pours
a
golden
slighty
hazy
color
smells
like
buttery
malts
and
spicy
english
hops
the
taste
is
fairly
balanced
buttery
malts
with
some
hop
fruitiness
very
clean
taste
kind
of
light
bodied
for
my
liking
all
around
this
is
a
decent
pale
ale
it
kind
of
reminds
me
of
bass
ale
because
of
the
buttery
malts
it
is
worth
a
try
the
mouthfeel
was
solid
with
nice
carbonation
easy
enough
drinking
beer
would
be
a
perfect
session
beer
for
some
folks
its
also
a
nice
intro
beer
for
advocating
it
also
went
well
with
the
food
the
beer
is
dark
gold
in
color
with
a
moderate
creamy
white
head
smell
is
of
slight
floral
hops
and
slightly
stale
bready
malt
taste
is
bitter
and
acidic
grassy
and
slightly
bready
malt
is
also
present
nothing
too
special
but
not
a
bad
beer
good
drinkability
this
is
a
beer
that
i
could
sit
down
with
a
6
pack
of
and
not
get
up
until
i
plowed
through
the
lot
this
one
has
a
clear
gold
body
with
a
slight
haze
to
it
small
offwhite
head
topping
it
off
the
nose
is
light
malt
the
taste
has
a
lightweet
malt
fron
buttery
tones
followed
by
a
touch
of
hop
bitterness
pretty
highly
carbonated
med
mouth
this
is
quite
refreshing
drinkability
just
a
run
of
the
mill
ale
imo
nothing
great
but
decent
may
be
a
nice
session
beer
for
some
pours
with
a
threefingered
white
head
that
fades
quickly
and
leaves
a
good
lace
medium
carbonation
light
almost
clear
amber
color
nose
is
somewhat
hoppy
starts
and
finishes
hoppy
with
a
lingering
hoppy

medium

for
a
12oz
bottle
from

greenland
nh
oelergud
hazy
golden
color
with
a
small
white
frothy
head
that
doesnt
last
long
bready
buttery
aromas
has
bready
grainy
and
butterscotch
flavors
it
is
light
to
medium
bodied
with
a
slick
mouthfeel
finishes
a
bit
sour
not
all
that
great
glad
i
only
bought
a
single
bottle
purchased
this
as
a
store
single
based
on
a
suggestion
from
the
owner
not
only
was
he
biased
towards
the
shipyard
he
even
had
a
very
similar
logo
tattooed
on
his
arm
great
ipa
compared
to
the
many
ive
tried
lately
though
im
not
a
big
fan
to
this
kind
no
lacing
or
carbonation
but
a
great
taste
not
bitter
in
the
least
would
suggest
to
any
ipa
drinker
the
beer
poured
an
orangetinged
harp
like
color
some
consistency
of
color
i
mean
there
was
little
head
and
no
lace
to
speak
of
the
beer
itself
is
sour
not
so
much
hoppy
but
sour
like
green
apples
or
old
leather
the
malt
does
not
add
to
the
hops
but
rather
contributes
to
the
overall
sourness
it
was
a
wierd
beer
for
me
usually
if
i
dont
like
a
beer
on
the
first
bottle
it
improves
with
the
second
and
ten
some
more
with
the
third
but
my
liking
for
this
beer
decreased
by
the
time
i
had
my
third
bottle
drinkablilty
not
bad
id
like
to
try
a
few
more
of
these
drinkability
highly
drinkable
due
to
its
uniqueness
and
balance
the
export
ale
is
flagship
brew
from
this
portland
me
brewery
i
like
this
beer
from
time
to
time
nice
session
beer
pours
a
rich
golden
color
with
a
oneinch
white
head
that
lingers
for
a
while
aroma
of
nice
ale
yeast
astringency
and
a
touch
of
hops
rich
buttery
mouthfeel
holds
a
palate
of
light
hops
fruit
apricots
and
some
breadiness
finishes
with
a
very
nice
buttery
texture
and
a
taste
of
dry
roasted
malt
i
like
this
and
itd
probably
make
a
good
session
beer
but
i
probably
dont
want
more
than
one
at
a
time
seems
to
me
that
this
brewery
is
a
bit
average
but
at
least
if
you
can
rely
on
this
as
a
session
brew
is
need
be
poured
out
a
golden
yellow
with
some
carbonation
visible
smell
consisted
of
grains
slight
hops
butter
caramel
and
some
breadiness
taste
was
pretty
much
as
the
smell
with
the
breadiness
really
showing
up
towards
the
end
and
mixing
with
some
peppery
flavors
that
lasts
into
the
aftertaste
this
ones
a
litlte
bit
above
average
but
nothing
worth
shouting
about
here
this
ale
is
a
clean
pale
yellow
with
a
fizzy
white
head
has
a
big
malty
sweet
aroma
with
some
spiceyness
and
something
else
ringwood
yeast
mabye
a
light
hop
bitterness
followed
by
a
quick
malty
sweetness
that
ends
with
a
smooth
spicey
hop
finish
and
again
something
else
ringwood
yeast
again
this
is
the
beer
that
turned
me
on
the
micro
revolution
it
was
nice
to
see
that
i
still
enjoy
it
too
sweet
to
have
more
than
one
imo
off
the
mark
in
terms
of
style
this
is
one
to
pass
on
like
said
i
was
looking
for
thisone
glad
i
found
it
shipyards
export
ale
exceeded
my
expectations
and
proved
to
be
a
very
enjoyable
pale
ale
i
was
impressed
with
the
mild
malty
sweetness
and
how
well
it
balanced
with
a
hoppy
nose
it
has
a
very
clean
finish
and
stays
on
the
palate
just
long
enough
to
know
youve
had
a
well
produced
brew
poured
into
an
imperial
pint
glass
formed
a
big
ol
2
offwhite
head
above
the
clear
golden
brew
laces
excellently
aroma
is
malty
with
a
tinge
of
hops
taste
is
of
slightly
buttery
pale
malts
ending
with
a
hops
bite
smooth
mouthfeel
and
the
drinkability
is
excellent
escepially
for
these
warm
summer
days
i
imagine
this
on
cask
would
be
exemplary
but
havent
seen
it
this
is
a
very
good
example
of
a
traditional
english
pale
ale
although
its
not
vastly
appealing
to
my
taste
buds
not
being
a
lover
of
the
style
throw
this
towards
your
english
pale
friends
and
they
will
love
you
for
it
as
authentic
as
ive
had
out
of
the
bottle
in
the
us
drinkability
too
bitter
beer
is
good
happy
free
gift
beering
mouthfeel
drinkability
as
well
as
taste
just
above
average
note
had
this
with
a
grilled
talapia
fillet
and
went
very
nicely
with
it
this
pale
ale
poured
a
clear
amber
color
with
white
sudsy
foam
that
settled
but
clung
to
the
glass
a
bit
the
smell
was
minimal
but
improved
as
the
beer
warmed
light
malt
with
a
bit
of
fruitiness
and
a
touch
of
hops
and
finally
a
light
touch
of
butter
the
taste
was
malty
with
a
light
touch
of
butter
diacetyl
some
floral
hops
and
a
decent
touch
of
hop
bitterness
in
the
finish
the
mouthfeel
was
smooth
crisp
and
dry
with
decent
tangy
hoppiness
the
body
was
medium
and
the
carbonation
was
modest
the
lingering
aftertaste
was
floral
and
bitter
hops
with
a
touch
of
butter
this
was
a
good
lighter
bodied
pale
ale
dry
and
easy
to
drink
a
bit
fizzy
and
biting
up
front
lightly
sweet
malt
and
quite
hoppy
especially
given
the
light
malt
profile
in
this
beer
long
hops
aftertaste
and
unpleasant
thin
malt
aftertaste
too
not
well
balanced
or
tasty
pretty
thin
and
nondescript
basically
a
heavier
hopped
golden
ale
not
a
bad
brew
one
that
i
could
see
myself
enjoying
on
a
nice
summer
vacation
up
north
on
the
maine
coast
overall
its
a
bit
subdued
its
not
bad
but
i
prefer
my
ales
with
a
little
more
character
a
real
disappointment
after
a
thumper
the
beer
pours
a
nice
golden
color
with
a
white
lace
head
the
aroma
is
of
pale
malts
and
a
sweet
yeast
scent
the
taste
is
decent
but
nothing
special
it
has
a
good
balance
of
pale
malts
and
mild
bittering
hops
there
is
not
much
complexity
but
it
is
a
fine
beer
none
the
less
the
mouthfeel
isnt
that
good
its
a
low
bodied
beer
with
way
too
much
carbonation
every
sip
ends
with
a
painful
burp
with
all
things
considered
this
is
still
a
good
drinker
bitter
smooth
with
a
feel
on
the
light
side
of
medium
good
hop
strength
for
a
pale
ale
approaching
an
ipa
nice
mouthfeel
being
medium
bodied
with
a
clean
crisp
finish
easily
a
most
drinakble
ale
when
poured
it
was
a
light
amber
yellow
with
not
much
on
the
foam
or
lace
the
smell
of
hops
malts
and
spices
filled
the
nose
the
taste
was
a
pleasant
surpise
of
malts
and
hops
with
a
spicy
nature
a
well
balance
of
sweetness
all
the
above
also
a
pleasant
after
taste
that
lingers
on
the
palate
pours
an
amber
with
a
nice
bright
white
head
a
light
chewy
malt
flavor
holds
in
the
sweetness
bitter
hop
finishing
and
a
slight
fruitness
attempt
to
balance
out
this
brew
fairly
thin
mouthfeel
a
drinkable
beer
but
nothing
special
another
hohum
shipyard
brew
pale
golden
in
color
with
a
sparse
white
head
aroma
is
floral
and
deceptively
hoppy
taste
is
bready
and
malty
without
alot
of
excess
sweetness
hop
bitterness
jumps
in
at
the
end
tying
things
op
nicely
great
drinkin
beer
not
too
strong
sweet
or
bitter
im
bringing
a
bunch
to
the
next
party
i
hit
drinkable
and
approcheable
for
converting
folks
drinkability
nothing
special
by
any
means
quite
light
and
lacking
in
character
wont
try
again
poured
a
big
bubble
foamy
dirty
white
colored
head
the
beer
is
clear
and
light
amber
in
color
the
smell
is
lightly
sweet
butterscotch
the
body
is
on
the
light
side
and
the
taste
is
pretty
well
balanced
between
malt
butterscotch
and
hop
bitterness
the
butterscotch
disappears
in
the
minimal
aftertaste
this
is
a
pretty
good
pale
ale
good
overall
brew
and
nice
sitting
by
the
fire
this
one
warms
up
nicely
nice
drink
tastey
fails
to
warm
up
as
nicely
as
i
would
wish
for
in
both
flavor
and
feel
definitely
a
bass
clone
palt
malt
slight
bittering
from
a
dose
of
what
i
assume
are
fuggles
highly
quaffable
and
good
for
a
session
or
a
meal
does
not
get
in
the
way
of
food
and
goes
down
easy
good
when
the
only
other
beers
on
draft
are
the
macros
yellow
gold
color
small
white
foamy
head
aroma
is
grainy
grassy
and
slightly
sweet
touch
of
breadyness
as
well
a
medium
bodied
blond
ale
malts
are
fruity
and
sweet
hops
are
fairly
spicy
with
a
touch
of
grapefruityness
yet
it
is
not
very
bitter
its
a
blond
ale
so
the
flavors
are
mild
but
it
does
have
some
character
to
it
sort
of
like
a
very
mild
pale
ale
light
and
refreshing
mouthfeel
is
full
and
round
finish
is
clean
and
smooth
aftertaste
is
slightly
sweet
tasted
this
brew
twice
on
a
recent
trip
to
maine
rated
it
exactly
the
same
both
times
funny
thing
is
i
did
not
think
i
had
tasted
it
twice
until
the
time
of
writing
after
the
trip
upon
comparing
notes
not
bad
i
must
say
so
myself
second
tasting
was
at
the
portland
airport
shipyard
brewpub
tasting
notes
on
the
menu
where
quite
good
full
bodied
yet
lighter
in
flavor
maltiness
shows
through
initially
followed
by
a
subtle
and
distinctive
hop
taste
with
a
very
clean
finish
a
golden
ale
with
a
coppery
hue
reminiscent
of
a
canadian
style
ale
of
old
first
tasting
was
at
the
muddy
rudder
in
yarmouth
this
was
my
first
beer
upon
arriving
in
maine
i
enjoyed
it
with
a
bowl
of
crab
stew
this
was
a
deliciously
fresh
tasting
and
well
built
brew
that
had
superior
drinkability
poured
out
a
golden
slightly
orange
color
with
a
head
of
white
foam
that
receded
and
eventually
fell
back
into
the
beer
after
a
few
sips
this
is
a
nice
and
pleasantly
bitter
ale
easy
to
drink
it
has
a
dry
bitterness
with
a
fruity
tang
along
with
a
grassy
hop
flavor
not
bad
at
all
the
taste
is
sweet
malt
then
clean
hops
with
a
nice
spicy
finish
one
of
the
best
shipyard
products
very
balanced
even
and
clean
great
combination
of
malt
and
hops
i
admit
i
am
a
closet
fan
of
a
good
export
ale
this
one
poured
a
medium
gold
color
with
a
white
head
that
was
snap
crackle
pop
like
with
carbonation
from
the
bottom
the
head
receded
pretty
quickly
though
leaving
a
slick
of
white
alonf
the
surface
that
continued
to
bubble
smell
was
oily
and
slightly
toffeeish
with
a
butter
aroma
wafting
here
and
there
taste
was
malty
and
copper
like
with
some
wheat
in
the
backbone
of
it
very
clean
a
crisp
a
slight
hop
bite
towards
the
end
of
the
taste
but
nothing
prominent
pretty
well
carbonated
adding
to
the
crispness
i
like
this
beer
and
would
love
to
try
it
on
cask
for
sure
poured
a
beautiful
golden
amber
with
a
nice
thick
white
head
smells
of
mild
malts
bread
and
a
hint
sweet
citrus
taste
is
well
balanced
with
the
caramel
malt
coming
through
at
the
end
for
a
nice
finish
solid
mothfeel
highly
drinkable
a
very
fine
offering
from
good
brewery
the
bottle
does
not
really
state
the
style
and
for
some
reason
i
thought
this
was
going
to
be
a
scottish
heavy
export
i
was
surprised
when
the
beer
poured
a
clear
gold
the
aroma
was
clean
and
fresh
and
slightly
fruity
mouthfeel
was
very
sturdy
bright
and
malty
on
the
tongue
with
a
bit
of
cooked
cereal
that
lingered
through
the
finish
im
still
not
sure
this
hits
the
pale
ale
style
and
still
seems
to
have
some
scottish
aspects
this
beer
pours
a
light
amber
color
with
a
fizzy
white
head
that
disappears
quickly
the
aroma
is
not
very
strong
but
it
it
a
little
fruity
the
flavor
is
very
malty
and
it
has
something
odd
in
the
aftertaste
possibly
burned
caramel
mixed
with
citrus
not
a
bad
beer
but
i
dont
particularly
like
it
this
is
a
great
looking
pale
ale
honey
colored
body
topped
by
a
thick
white
head
that
shows
excellent
retention
but
little
lacing
hop
laced
fruity
aroma
strong
notes
of
pear
or
raisin
the
taste
is
a
good
bit
of
malt
sweetness
with
some
fruitiness
mixed
in
slight
bitterness
on
the
finish
but
not
much
mouthfeel
is
solid
and
enjoyable
drinkability
is
also
good
as
this
goes
down
smooth
seems
like
a
more
traditional
pale
ale
i
like
this
one
dark
yellow
colored
with
a
white
fizzy
head
that
dissipates
quickly
little
to
no
aroma
mild
flavor
of
floral
hops
with
citrus
highlights
a
light
hop
bitter
finish
comes
through
smooth
mouthfeel
but
a
little
watery
pretty
light
and
average
beer
all
around
appears
a
golden
orange
crystal
clear
hue
with
a
pearl
white
two
finger
sized
head
of
foam
that
leaves
behind
trickled
rings
of
lace
in
my
glass
aroma
some
nice
fruit
notes
of
cherry
aromas
arise
at
first
blended
with
a
mild
hop
aroma
and
buttery
malt
finish
overall
pretty
pleasant
not
mindblowing
but
pleasant
taste
is
crisp
sweetness
at
first
then
a
slightly
woody
tone
creeps
in
on
the
scene
with
some
earthy
mild
hop
bitterness
alright
not
bad
and
i
must
note
that
the
flavor
seems
a
bit
unbalanced
toward
the
woody
hop
bitterness
side
of
things
mouthfeel
is
a
bit
thin
lighter
bodied
ale
not
much
texture
here
kind
of
boring
in
fact
however
its
a
beer
meant
to
be
drank
as
a
session
brew
but
i
will
continue
my
search
for
extraordinary
brews
when
this
brew
was
poured
it
had
a
large
white
creamy
head
with
small
bubbles
that
lasted
a
good
long
time
this
brew
had
good
lacing
to
it
and
the
body
was
clear
with
an
amber
hue
the
flavor
was
smooth
and
lasted
throughtout
my
rating
of
this
brew
this
brew
poured
a
creamy
white
head
of
fine
to
largely
sized
bubbles
that
lasted
a
long
time
and
left
a
good
lacing
its
body
was
a
clear
thin
amberorange
color
i
thought
this
brew
was
very
smooth
from
start
to
finish
with
a
light
bitter
flavor
throughout
it
had
a
mild
bread
hop
aroma
to
it
that
was
not
very
complex
and
rather
on
the
plain
side
this
used
to
be
an
old
favorite
of
mine
some
10
or
more
years
ago
and
i
remember
it
being
better
than
this
bottle
i
have
now
how
time
changes
anyway
a
deep
golden
brew
with
an
esb
like
head
to
go
along
not
much
retention
here
and
little
lacing
aroma
is
bitter
with
slight
hop
and
malt
fragrance
medium
bodied
and
crisp
with
a
slightly
dry
finish
flavor
could
be
stronger
and
as
i
remember
used
to
be
quite
hoppy
on
draught
not
anything
outstanding
but
there
are
so
many
better
than
this
one
pours
a
golden
coppery
color
with
a
retentive
head
shipyard
brews
have
generally
been
very
favorable
tastewise
to
me
and
their
flagship
product
meets
that
standard
the
malt
characteristic
is
immediately
noticeable
but
it
doesnt
necessarily
dominate
the
hops
in
fact
the
finish
is
both
dry
and
hoppy
overall
i
thought
the
brew

added

product
would
be
similar
would
drink
again
but
not
if
there
was
something
else
on
that
i
hadnt
had

4

option
overall
id
give
this
beer
a
solid
b
grade
overall
not
too
exciting
but
its
above
average
for
me
when
considering
american
lagers
and
some
wheat
ales
fairly
decent
stuff
from
high
and
mighty
i
look
forward
to
finding
and
try
more
of
their
beers
overall
not
too
sure
what
to
make
of
this
beer
it
could
be
a
nice
quaffer
but
the
grassy
bitterness
of
the
hops
just
isnt
sitting
right
with
me
its
like
a
pilsner
without
the
crispness
0not
a
huge
fan
but
my
reaction
may
have
been
partially
affected
by
the
high
expectations
i
think
i
may
come
back
to
it
at
some
point
because
i
suspect
the
it
may
have
been
a
bad
keg
one
of
the
things
my
friend
noted
when
he
recommended
it
was
a
nice
carbonation
in
the
beer
which
i
didnt
get
at
all
this
beer
seems
too
well
thought
of
for
me
to
have
had
such
a
bad
experience
maybe
just
a
bad
keg
yea
any
beer
named
beer
of
the
gods
has
be
be
masculine
dominant
and
gentlemanly
high
mightys
version
is
just
to
timid
even
though
her
finesse
and
delicate
nature
is
charming
this
is
perhaps
the
most
commonly
found
session
beer
at
better
beer
bars
in
the
bostonarea
and
there
is
good
reason
for
that
though
rather
simple
in
nature
beer
of
the
gods
is
immensely
quaffable
and
would
make
for
a
terrific
summer
quencher
soft
aromas
of
crackery
pale
malt
and
grassy
earthy
noble
hops
vague
lemon
pith
flavor
is
crisp
and
lightly
bitter
earthy
hop
flavors
and
mild
lemon
pith
again
lending
bitterness
and
citrus
essence
light
bodied
with
ample
carbonation
highly
drinkable
pairs
well
with
many
types
of
food
and
social
situations
simplicity
is
vastly
underrated
these
days
beer
is
wet
and
sweet
with
a
medium
to
light
in
body
beer
is
mildly
bitter
nice
yeast
and
a
great
finish
id
have
this
beer
again
a
little
shocked
but
i
do
love
a
good
blonde
poured
into
a
glass
mug
pours
hazy
straw
colored
with
a
twofinger
length
white
head
that
dissipates
slowly
i
notice
plentiful
streaming
bubbles
in
the
beer
i
can
pick
up
aromas
of
sweet
and
bready
malts
as
well
as
citrus
hops
the
flavors
up
front
are
hoppy
i
pick
up
those
citrus
hops
with
some
slightly
bitter
orange
or
grapefruit
peel
in
the
back
end
along
with
some
herbal
hop
flavors
the
malt
adds
a
nice
grainy
backbone
that
isnt
very
heavy
if
you
told
me
this
was
a
pale
ale
i
wouldnt
have
doubted
it
the
body
is
light
to
medium
with
strong
carbonation
the
finish
is
mostly
clean
and
crisp
the
drinkability
is
high
this
is
a
very
good
beer
o
overall
a
pretty
average
blonde
ale
lots
of
bread
and
grains
to
it
and
not
much
else
would
pass
on
this
one
again
d
decent
golden
ale
light
and
refreshing
not
too
much
going
on
but
worth
a
shot
o
overall
id
say
this
beer
is
more
suited
to
demigods
than
gods
but
it
is
a
very
nicely
refreshing
summery
beer
that
offers
much
more
flavor
than
the
traditional
summer
beers
its
crisp
but
not
too
thin
eminently
drinkable
without
being
too
heavy
this
is
a
beer
to
bring
to
a
picnic
andor
enjoy
over
a
grill
overall
this
just
missed
the
mark
get
rid
of
the
metallic
twang
and
cooked
veggies
and
this
is
a
great
lighter
beer
mouthfeel
is
excellent
light
bodied
with
moderate
carbonation
and
a
nice
long
dry
finish
excellent
if
im
in
the
mood
for
session
drinking
i
will
most
certainly
get
this
again
high
mighty
has
better
beer
than
this
this
beer
poured
out
with
a
very
light
yellow
looking
body
the
head
was
fluffy
and
white
in
color
the
retention
was
decent
the
smell
of
the
beer
was
also
very
soft
and
light
not
too
much
on
the
nose
really
other
than
some
light
grains
the
taste
of
the
beer
was
light
with
some
grains
and
citrus
notes
the
mouthfeel
also
very
light
and
moderately
carbonated
overall
this
beer
would
be
best
to
have
in
the
summer
time
i
think
i
cant
say
ive
buy
this
on
again
though
notes
this
one
is
tasty
the
dry
finish
fits
the
style
very
well
cheers
love
the
beers
that
throw
style
guidelines
out
the
window
some
sediment
on
the
bottom
of
the
bottle
which
we
added
a
few
drops
into
our
sample
pale
yellow
color
with
some
yeasty
haze
and
a
good
amount
of
lace
clean
graini
ness
dried
grass
lemony
herbal
hop
and
a
touch
of
yeast
in
the
nose
clean
dry
malt
palate
on
a
dainty
smooth
body
hops
are
more
flavorforward
than
bitter
heavy
tone
of
wild
herbs
compliments
the
dryness
of
the
malt
bit
of
yeast
though
still
very
clean
this
one
screams
session
beera
great
pick
for
something
light
yet
still
packed
with
flavor
bitter
and
funky
crossed
with
that
old
catpee
and
skunked
flavor
to
start
however
flavors
really
dissipate
after
a
few
slugs
and
you
get
a
soursoapy
tongue
for
the
rest
of
the
brew
snappy
sour
hops
in
the
finish
help
the
thing
go
down
something
is
really
missing
here
this
was
a
fine
free
beer
but
i
wouldnt
pay
for
one
yeups
this
isnt
a
heavenly
beer
but
its
pretty
good
the
malt
is
there
to
provide
some
sweetness
to
keep
the
modest
amount
of
good
hops
at
bay
zesty
and
dry
some
spice
on
the
end
very
drinkable
light
and
refreshing
odthank
the
gods
i
only
got
a
single
of
this
for
free
essentially
not
good
no
redeaming
qualities
i
have
had
worse
than
this
but
this
is
one
of
the
weaker
beers
i
have
had
in
recent
memory
pours
an
ever
so
slightly
hazy
golden
color
pretty
with
a
nice
white
head
with
some
nice
staying
action
particularly
for
a
beer
of
this
style
light
nose
of
hay
light
hops
some
lemon
kind
of
farmhousey
lots
of
rustic
in
the
flavor
definitely
modeled
after
some
of
the
better
farmhouse
ales
out
there
just
nice
and
fresh
plenty
of
dry
musty
flavors
yet
nice
and
grassy
touch
of
citrus
and
a
nice
pale
malt
profile
smooth
and
drinkable
certainly
a
session
beer
uber
quenching
on
this
ballsoaker
of
a
summer
day
seems
like
a
lot
of
people
have
misunderstood
this
beer
or
perhaps
the
style
altogether
but
more
people
should
embrace
the
light
and
subtle
flavors
of
this
well
crafted
ale
which
is
actually
rather
lagery
tasty
overall
surprisingly
decent
for
a
low
abv
beer
that
is
likely
over
a
year
old
im
not
a
big
fan
of
other
hm
beers
that
ive
had
but
i
bet
that
this
is
very
nice
the
fresher
you
get
it
this
is
a
slight
step
up
from
an
adjunct
lager
nothing
off
about
it
per
se
its
just
completely
underwhelming
beer
of
the
gods
it
is
not
awesome
name
that
sets
a
expectations
so
high
that
this
beer
cannot
compete
this
beer
should
be
called
beer
of
the
peasants
its
not
worthy
of
this
name
and
i
feel
bad
for
anyone
else
who
picks
this
up
eh
drinks
ok
no
terrible
qualities
but
nothing
far
above
average
either
and
as
a
sum
of
its
parts
it
still
falls
short
i
love
this
brewing
compnay
but
i
would
much
prefer
purity
of
essence
if
i
wanted
to
enjoy
a
carbonated
lager
price
is
nice
4
99
for
a
22
oz
bomber
doverall
cheap
and
easy
drinking
nothing
special
but
not
the
worst
thing
in
the
world
value
im
not
sure
because
this
was
a
gift
at
6
or
7
per
sixer
id
say
its
decent
but
i
have
a
feeling
its
more
expensive
than
that
d
well
its
certainly
light
enough
to
drink
a
few
of
these
but
all
told
i
think
there
are
many
better
blondes
out
there
as
always
grab
on
and
try
it
may
be
better
on
your
palate
end
note
frankly
i
find
this
stuff
to
be
delicious
i
expected
the
worst
given
the
reviews
from
other
people
here
maybe
i
got
a
fresh
bottle
maybe
the
recipe
was
recently
improved
i
dont
know
all
i
know
is
this
beer
is
good
and
im
sticking
to
it
d
overall
beer
of
the
gods
is
a
decent
beer
but
it
is
not
heavenly
like
the
name
suggests
with
time
im
less
sure
its
a
cascade
brewa
little
nobleishyeah
tettnanger
oh
well
i
feel
terrible
giving
such
a
bad
review
but
i
cant
let
this
one
pass
if
i
did
get
a
bad
bottle
then
i
apologize
to
the
brewer
others
be
warned
before
trying
this
one
this
is
awful
drainpour
one
of
the
worst
beers
ive
ever
come
across
my
wife
concurs
pours
out
a
murky
yellow
blonde
color
with
a
massive
white
creamy
head
that
has
duvellike
ice
cream
properties
and
extreme
retention
should
have
poured
this
one
a
bit
less
aggressively
the
head
was
a
bit
too
much
in
this
case
clouds
of
thick
lacing
are
left
behind
that
make
for
a
good
looking
beer
smell
has
lots
of
yeast
notes
breadiness
and
some
funk
even
the
nose
also
has
some
grassy
notes
from
hops
the
overall
aroma
could
be
stronger
and
have
a
bit
more
to
it
taste
is
good
for
a
while
but
seems
to
degrade
it
has
a
nice
malt
backbone
in
the
aftertaste
and
yeasty
notes
up
front
the
hops
are
pretty
bitter
and
lend
grassy
and
floral
notes
some
citrus
too
the
flavors
up
front
tend
to
disappear
and
the
beer
ended
up
tasting
soapy
to
me
not
my
glasswares
fault
for
sure
the
mouthfeel
had
a
light
body
and
medium
carbonation
a
decent
amount
of
cream
helps
the
watery
feel
and
the
beer
leaves
a
coat
of
bitter
hops
drinkability
is
decent
the
beer
has
a
decent
taste
and
a
good
price
the
flavor
seems
to
degrade
a
bit
but
this
one
could
definitely
be
sessioned
probably
a
one
shot
deal
for
me
d
i
could
drink
a
sixpack
of
these
if
they
still
made
them
and
still
be
rarin
for
more
purchased
a
bomber
for
3
99
at
whole
foods
dedham
split
into
two
glasses
with
my
wife
a
lot
of
sediment
at
the
bottle
of
the
bottle
fluffy
white
head
but
a
stale
hazy
yellow
colored
body
not
much
carbonation
either
had
a
somewhat
hoppy
and
piney
smell
which
is
odd
for
a
blonde
ale
taste
was
soapy
with
just
a
hint
of
citrus
like
a
witbier
to
make
it
barely
palatable
extremely
thin
mouthfeel
borderline
watery
i
guess
you
get
what
you
pay
for
for
3
99
i
wasnt
expecting
much
but
if
i
paid
decent
cash
for
a
pint
of
this
at
a
beer
bar
id
consider
it
to
be
wasting
my
time
and
money
d
if
you
can
wait
out
the
long
pour
this
is
a
very
drinkable
ale
and
at
4
5
abv
one
you
can
do
several
of
great
name
mediocre
beer
not
a
bad
interpretation
of
the
style
at
all
has
more
character
than
typical
though
yeasty
aftertaste
and
carbonation
level
do
slow
it
down
a
bit
pours
a
very
pale
yellow
slightly
chill
hazed
with
a
towering
snow
white
head
lots
of
stickage
a
rather
funky
nose
stale
hops
pale
malt
and
a
mustiness
about
it
i
actually
thought
saison
before
reading
the
style
here
on
ba
not
necessarily
a
good
one
however
the
mustiness
in
the
nose
is
a
bit
off
putting
just
before
the
liquid
hits
your
lips
brightly
carbonated
some
lemon
skin
seltzerlike
bland
and
im
sure
a
bit
past
its
prime
im
sure
this
wascould
be
a
better
beer
but
i
think
this
has
become
infected
light
in
body
and
very
easy
to
drink
my
first
impression
of
high
and
mighty
was
unfortunately
not
a
good
one
d
refreshingly
tart
yet
smooth
making
this
fairly
easy
to
consume
a
smooth
dry
grassiness
of
pale
ale
proportions
a
lager
like
smoothness
and
a
relatively
low
abv
all
aids
and
helps
things
go
down
a
bomber
feels
about
right
here
but
i
could
certainly
drink
more
during
the
summer
time
making
this
a
decent
quencher
this
is
fairly
comparable
to
their
purity
of
essence
which
i
enjoyed
slightly
better
but
worth
checking
out
none
the
less
a
nice
alternative
to
so
many
similar
summer
beers
witbiers
hefes
that
everyone
their
mom
seems
to
churn
out
without
any
distinction
these
guys
definitely
have
brewed
something
a
bit
less
polished
than
the
others
but
offer
up
an
earthier
farm
style
wheat
beer
less
so
a
belgian
blonde
this
pours
a
nice
hazy
chunky
gold
with
fluffy
white
full
head
nice
sticky
lace
the
aroma
is
definitely
a
wheat
beer
with
stale
biscuit
lemon
citrus
spice
in
the
nose
the
flavor
is
earthy
with
a
seasoned
haysour
yeast
quality
some
sweetness
from
the
malt
is
held
by
the
yeast
sour
hop
edging
definitely
do
not
drink
too
cold
or
the
complexity
will
be
loss
making
you
wonder
about
this
odd
hazy
hefeweise
a
nice
interesting
farmhouse
style
wheat
for
a
slow
session
taste
is
sharp
and
wheaty
and
very
unfiltered
tasting
but
in
a
good
way
chewy
earthy
and
grassy
a
pretty
solid
beer
i
say
d
not
worth
the
money
i
paid
or
the
title
beer
of
the
gods
i
find
it
to
be
sloppy
and
unfocused
if
youre
going
to
have
the
swagger
to
label
a
beer
that
you
make
so
confidently
youd
better
have
much
much
more
to
back
it
up
weak
showing
from
high
and
mighty
high
mightys
worst
offering
id
give
this
one
a
shot
if
you
come
across
it
looking
at
some
of
the
other
ratings
here
i
wondered
if
i
had
the
same
beer
but
i
soldiered
on
to
complete
the
bottle
d
this
was
really
different
from
most
blonde
ales
the
lemon
aroma
and
taste
was
a
surprise
drinkability
though
not
my
favorite
style
this
beer
was
very
refreshing
low
abv
and
the
overall
easy
drinking
of
the
brew
make
it
perfect
for
relaxing
on
a
warm
summer
night
i
would
drink
this
again
something
about
this
beer
rubbed
me
the
wrong
way
i
would
not
seek
this
out
again
this
beer
poured
a
very
hazy
light
straw
color
with
a
very
short
but
thick
bright
white
head
to
it
head
retention
is
quite
good
leaving
a
good
amount
of
lacing
on
the
glass
nose
is
very
yeasty
i
am
almost
pressed
to
say
belgian
yeasts
grains
and
some
lemon
zest
to
it
taste
is
of
bitter
hops
up
front
then
moves
in
to
grains
yeast
and
finishes
with
a
high
lemon
smack
to
it
mouthfeel
is
a
lighter
bodied
beer
higher
carbonation
and
felt
somewhat
creamy
and
chewy
at
the
end
this
isnt
necessarily
beer
of
the
gods
as
advertised
but
a
drinkable
beer
that
i
would
choose
over
a
macro
anyday
this
is
a
rather
pedestrian
offering
nothing
overly
distinctive
about
the
nose
appearance
or
flavor
a
pale
straw
color
with
a
rocky
white
head
tons
of
lacing
nose
was
zesty
with
notes
of
lemon
sharp
florals
and
a
thin
estery
quality
the
taste
was
slightly
skunkish
had
some
sharp
biscuity
flavor
more
lemony
sharpness
in
the
middle
and
a
slight
toasty
end
but
certainly
nothing
distinctive
it
really
takes
a
superior
effort
to
rise
above
the
level
of
the
streets
for
this
style
p
s
the
brewer
at
mayflower
informs
me
that
high
mighty
havent
bottled
beer
in
at
least
a
year
so
the
sample
may
have
had
some
age
on
it
and
now
that
i
think
about
it
i
dont
think
the
store
had
too
much
respect
for
their
limited
roomtemperature
craft
selection
caveat
emptor
i
suppose
it
is
a
dark
day
for
the
beer
gods
indeed
this
beer
is
a
good
american
blond
not
a
bad
beer
if
you
are
into
a
good
blond
and
is
also
a
good
beer
for
the
string
time
or
summer
light
on
the
abv
i
think
i
could
probablt
suck
back
a
few
of
these
on
a
hot
summer
day
pours
a
two
finger
white
head
that
fades
quickly
leaving
some
lace
almost
clear
pale
amber
color
hoppy
nose
strong
carbonation
and
lightmedium
bodied
flavor
is
unremarkable
just
some
hops
piney
aftertaste
5
50
for
a
22oz
bottle
from
tullys
beer
wine
wells
me
overall
not
something
id
probably
drink
again
this
was
an
easy
bomber
to
get
through
very
drinkable
and
paired
well
with
tarentaise
cheese
the
beer
pours
a
hazy
gold
color
with
a
12
white
head
that
slowly
fades
to
lacing
the
aroma
is
decent
it
has
a
light
pale
malt
scent
along
with
some
bitter
hop
notes
the
yeast
also
emits
some
fruity
esters
as
well
the
taste
is
pretty
awful
its
really
bitter
and
hard
to
swallow
its
dry
with
some
nasty
yeast
off
flavors
its
kind
of
watery
in
the
finish
the
mouthfeel
is
average
it
is
a
low
bodied
beer
with
good
carbonation
these
guys
need
to
readjust
their
business
plan
they
need
to
invest
in
a
filter
and
they
need
to
invest
in
some
pasteurization
also
the
recipes
need
work
its
one
and
done
for
me
taste
average
nothing
special
certainly
does
not
live
up
to
its
name
it
seems
like
a
confused
beer
hv
frankly
looking
at
the
overall
score
before
trying
this
i
expected
far
less
to
me
this
is
a
solid
beer
with
a
lot
of
flavor
22oz
bottle
purchased
for
4
50
from
bauer
wines
in
boston
pours
a
justopaque
light
gold
with
a
fluffy
head
gentle
hop
aroma
flavour
is
uninspiring
and
light
starts
off
a
bit
empty
upfront
though
it
does
make
its
way
to
a
decent
mild
bitterness
in
the
aftertaste
nice
lacing
a
650ml
bottle
with
bottled
on
6182008
on
the
label
served
in
a
pint
glass
hazy
yellow
color
thick
white
head
little
bit
of
lacing
aroma
of
mostly
citrus
with
a
little
bit
of
grain
grapefruit
taste
not
much
else
there
pleasant
enough
but
not
outstanding
other
comments
i
dont
get
the
point
of
this
high
concept
beer
its
decent
enough
though
i
cannot
say
i
would
slam
this
beer
but
i
probably
would
not
buy
it
again
really
uninteresting
and
not
a
whole
lot
going
on
at
all
really
still
there
are
worse
ones
out
there
for
sure
had
on
tap
at
the
moan
and
dove
the
drink
settled
with
a
pale
gold
color
with
creamy
lacing
and
thin
head
the
aromas
had
a
slight
chilled
hint
to
it
of
mixed
grains
hops
and
florals
the
taste
was
decently
bittersour
in
balance
with
a
generally
floral
flavoring
the
carbonation
was
the
best
part
of
the
drink
as
it
was
crisp
up
until
near
the
end
overall
decent
blonde
mouthfeel
is
good
nice
thinness
to
it
with
some
body
carbonation
is
good
but
it
doesnt
leave
me
wanting
for
another
wouldnt
mind
not
finishing
this
one
actually
but
i
will
d
ehhh
far
from
godly
im
not
sure
about
this
beer
it
pours
a
rather
pale
orange
plenty
hazy
with
a
moderate
amount
of
carbonation
there
isnt
much
head
retention
or
lacing
to
speak
of
the
aroma
is
the
high
point
in
that
youll
get
some
lemony
notes
hop
esters
and
a
malty
pils
characteristic
the
taste
is
a
bit
off
there
is
a
lemony
bite
right
off
the
bat
with
more
bittering
and
acrid
notes
coming
through
at
the
finish
the
beer
tilts
on
the
dry
side
watery
thin
perhaps
with
a
bit
of
sharp
citrusy
lemon
zing
its
not
that
interesting
and
im
not
sure
whats
supposed
to
be
going
on
with
this
beer
there
are
some
very
subtle
but
harsh
citrusy
notes
lurking
in
the
background
too
the
aftertaste
is
a
bit
much
as
well
this
is
a
one
and
done
for
me
perhaps
as
a
beer
to
refresh
and
cool
on
a
hot
summer
day
this
might
work
out
better
but
sampling
this
in
february
in
new
england
just
doesnt
cut
it
pours
a
clouded
gold
white
head
that
falls
to
nothing
eventually
nose
is
a
metallic
and
citrus
mix
theres
an
odd
funk
to
it
flavor
is
not
good
ack
pasty
dough
with
an
acrid
lemon
hit
just
does
nothing
for
me
feel
is
okay
overall
this
is
not
very
drinkable
i
cant
suggest
it
and
i
would
never
go
back
to
it
again
dry
and
ashy
has
a
dry
afterfeel
an
ashy
bitter
hefeweizen
its
a
confused
beer
and
not
in
a
great
way
i
would
like
to
take
the
recipe
use
a
belgian
yeast
strain
and
dump
a
bunch
of
candi
sugar
into
to
dry
it
out
into
a
nice
saison
drinkability
i
like
this
one
but
i
dont
think
it
is
for
everyone
it
would
probably
be
hard
to
take
more
than
one
or
two
of
these
at
a
time
this
really
fits
the
description
of
a
fizzy
yellow
beer
not
quite
sure
they
were
going
for
on
this
one
but
to
each
his
own
if
this
is
a
beer
of
the
gods
then
i
guess
a
god
i
am
not
beer
of
the
gods
this
aint
reedit
this
year
i
had
botg
on
tap
and
spoke
to
the
brewer
he
was
astonished
to
hear
that
id
found
bottles
when
and
where
i
got
them
and
opined
that
they
were
almost
certainly
diverted
from
their
intended
destination
in
the
holyoke
sewer
system
its
now
a
draft
only
beer
and
is
much
better
than
what
i
had
a
couple
of
summers
ago
a
slightly
better
than
average
session
beer
sort
of
an
alt
and
sort
of
a
generic
american
pale
ale
very
drinkable
and
no
offensive
character
of
any
kind
my
apologies
for
reviewing
the
spoiled
beer
overall
itd
be
a
drinkable
session
beer
if
i
enjoyed
the
taste
better
i
wouldnt
recommend
it
but
its
worth
a
try
taste
the
initial
sips
were
astringent
like
unripe
bananas
but
it
smoothed
over
eventually
to
blossom
in
fairly
flowery
tones
and
got
better
with
each
sip
but
overall
it
didnt
do
anything
for
me
ill
have
to
try
this
one
again
so
for
now
it
gets
a
passing
grade
drinkability
not
a
bad
summer
beer
a
bit
more
bitter
than
id
like
to
see
for
the
style
but
this
could
grow
on
me
12oz
brown
bottle
from
florians
very
hazy
yellow
body
with
a
half
inch
of
white
head
smells
malty
with
a
good
dose
of
floral
hops
tastes
like
citrussy
pithy
floral
hops
with
caramel
malt
making
a
nice
malt
backbone
the
mix
of
hops
is
really
nice
lighter
bodied
with
only
a
moderate
amount
of
carbonation
the
great
flavor
and
light
mouthfeel
make
this
a
really
drinkable
beer
it
has
the
perfect
balance
of
full
flavor
and
refreshing
drinkability
good
stuff
slightly
hazed
pale
yellow
body
with
a
short
cap
of
bright
white
foam
nice
stickage
and
decent
head
retention
malty
aroma
grainy
and
bready
with
lemony
hop
notes
moderate
bitterness
with
some
bite
lingering
in
the
finish
mild
malt
presence
with
the
same
lemon
hop
character
but
a
little
floral
too
lightish
bodied
with
moderate
carbonation
some
tannic
dryness
fairly
enjoyable
and
easy
drinking
the
smell
was
a
carbonated
whiff
of
beer
smell
not
at
all
letting
you
know
what
was
awaiting
you
the
first
taste
left
me
thinking
man
this
is
a
bit
hoppy
without
a
real
purpose
the
essence
of
balance
and
proportion
was
not
there
however
there
was
a
nice
thickness
to
the
mouthfeel
a
bit
of
a
malt
base
to
help
the
bitterness
fade
it
was
quite
refreshing
and
it
had
a
bit
of
snap
perhaps
the
two
goals
of
a
an
american
blonde
in
that
sense
its
a
bit
underated
here
overall
it
probably
wont
be
viewed
as
a
terrific
achievement
just
a
decent
alternative
to
macroswill
pours
a
cloudy
light
orange
with
a
huge
white
foamy
head
the
head
leaves
nice
lacing
making
this
a
good
looking
brew
the
smell
is
on
the
light
side
with
sweet
malt
and
floral
aromas
the
taste
has
a
crisp
hop
carbonated
bite
with
lemonsweet
maltwheat
and
bread
yeast
the
mf
is
light
with
all
flavors
mixing
pretty
well
a
beer
thats
not
too
excitingbut
for
the
style
a
blond
ale
packs
a
flavor
punch
mouthfeel
is
sweet
yeasty
medium
bodied
and
smooth
with
a
slightly
hoppy
and
spritzy
finish
md
semieasy
down
but
why
not
a
great
brew
too
thin
on
flavor
neede
more
wheaty
citrus
too
it
what
gods
are
this
a
beer
of
drinkability
is
poor
id
have
a
macro
lager
before
another
one
of
these
this
was
a
sink
pour
not
because
it
was
particularly
foul
but
because
it
was
a
waste
of
calories
ok
i
must
admit
i
was
skeptical
at
first
of
a
beer
called
beer
of
the
gods
from
massachusetts
that
bills
itself
as
a
koelschalt
i
first
had
it
on
tap
at
cambridge
common
but
bought
this
sixer
as
i
was
coming
back
from
a
recent
ski
trip
it
pours
straw
yellow
and
lightly
hazy
with
a
half
inch
of
bright
white
head
that
has
some
decent
staying
power
the
aroma
surprisingly
is
actually
mostly
malt
nice
and
toasty
with
a
hint
of
sulfur
around
the
edge
maybe
each
sip
opens
with
a
bright
german
hop
flavor
followed
immediately
by
a
bracing
bitterness
that
somewhat
overmatches
the
light
body
as
the
sip
evolves
the
hop
flavor
returns
very
strong
but
still
smooth
like
those
noble
hops
are
famous
for
hints
of
malt
in
the
aftertaste
and
thats
it
by
far
the
best
part
is
the
drinkability
the
strong
smooth
bitterness
combined
with
a
light
body
and
relatively
low
alcohol
make
this
a
complete
winner
i
could
drink
gallons
of
it
in
a
sitting
tastes
best
in
big
gulps
even
if
im
trying
to
have
a
sippin
session
i
can
see
myself
really
getting
into
this
one
come
springtime
poured
into
an
imperial
pint
glass
formed
a
1
bright
white
head
over
the
lightly
light
golden
yellow
brew
head
fades
at
an
acceptable
pace
with
spotty
delicate
lace
aroma
is
minimal
but
what
is
present
consists
of
biscuits
with
tinges
of
fruit
and
spicing
taste
is
in
your
face
bitter
upfront
mixed
with
citrus
that
soon
gives
way
to
the
generic
bitterness
again
mouthfeel
and
drinkability
are
just
not
where
i
would
hope
a
saison
should
be
pours
a
pale
cloudy
golden
decent

a

througout
i
dont
believe
ive
had
this
stlye
of
beer
before
its
unusualbut
worth
a
try
i
first
heard
of
this
beer
at
the
2006
portland
international
beerfest
where
it
ranked
among
the
more
popular
beers
i
was
pouring
as
a
volunteer
at
the
adjacent
booth
and
it
seemed
every
other
customer
wanted
one
i
think
in
large
part
this
was
due
to
its
coolballsy
name
reaction
after
tasting
was
mixed
a
good
beer
for
me
id
like
to
try
another
one
at
the
peak
of
freshness
first
i
had
ever
seen
or
heard
of
this
beer
when
i
found
this
weekend
here
in
buffalothis
poured
a
peachy
hazed
blondorange
color
a
decent
well
defind
white
head
atop
leaving
a
trace
amount
of
lace
as
it
settled
quickly
quite
citrusy
in
the
nose
very
orangy
with
lighter
lemon
hints
a
slight
phenolic
element
shows
itself
as
well
with
a
hint
of
toasted
wheat
malt
as
well
the
flavors
really
made
you
want
more
all
around
and
a
thinner
mouthfeel
kept
me
from
getting
to
interested
at
the
same
timesomewhat
citrusy
with
some
toasty
wheat
malt
up
front
but
it
quickly
is
gone
and
an
ubrupt
finish
leaves
you
hangin
eh
it
has
a
nice
aroma
but
honestly
its
kinda
boringnot
a
bad
beer
just
kinda
void
of
any
complexities
high
mighty
brewing
co
and
paper
city
brewing
co
have
the
same
address
in
holyoke
mass
i
dont
know
if
paper
city
is
renting
some
of
its
brewery
to
another
brewing
company
or
its
just
made
by
paper
city
under
another
name
tried
this
one
again
with
even
less
favorable
results
less
aroma
than
i
remembered
and
a
more
acidic
mouth
feel
tinny
and
sharp
all
the
way
through
i
only
took
1
pt
off
appearence
cuz
this
one
didnt
even
throw
much
of
a
head
beer
of
the
gods
and
the
logo
is
pretty
neat
seems
to
be
on
the
wrong
beer
though
a
bad
american
saison
to
put
it
bluntly
overly
spiced
rottedfruit
flavors
and
intensely
bitter
the
best
thing
about
beer
of
the
gods
is
that
i
only
picked
up
one
bottle
if
this
is
the
beer
gods
drinking
im
praying
for
hell
again
nothing
inherently
wrong
with
this
one
its
just
really
really
simple
and
basically
average
in
all
areas
if
you
want
something
thats
just
run
of
the
mill
although
why
would
you
then
this
ones
for
you
but
if
youre
looking
for
even
a
hint
of
bold
flavour
look
elsewhere
once
i
got
the
whole
style
thing
sorted
out
it
was
much
easier
to
decide
how
i
feel
about
this
high
mighty
offering
while
it
may
not
be
able
to
compete
with
the
best
that
germany
has
to
offer
this
is
a
better
than
decent
stab
at
a
hoppierthanhell
kolsch
even
though
i
didnt
want
it
to
be
lousy
beer
i
would
have
loved
to
have
been
able
to
use
the
line
beer
of
the
gods
is
really
more
like
beer
of
the
dogs
i
cannot
recommend
this
beer
if
i
had
to
pair
it
i
would
pick
a
five
cheese
pizza
with
fontina
and
gouda
leave
this
one
on
the
shelf
in
exchange
for
another
in
the
style
drinkability
beer
of
the
gods
this
is
not
i
would
not
recommend
this
the
only
reason
i
did
not
give
it
lower
is
because
i
have
had
a
few
that
really
sucked
nice
effervescent
quenching
mouthfeel
a
great
summer
beer
very
drinkable
also
bright
gold
hazy
with
the

and
lasts

over
the

inspired
the

starts
with
modestly
grainy
pils
malt
nice
and
crackly
feeling
with
the
carbonation
lightish

tending
towards
medium
slightly
doughy

from

dry
pear
not
nearly
as
much
as
the
aroma
suggested
good
solid
hop
bitterness
in
the
finish
floral
noble
and
ever
so
slightly
metallic
finishes
off
crisp
and
dry
just
a
little
bit
of
pilsy
malt
aftertaste
drinks
like
a
kolsch
with
an
alt
finish
quite
an
easy
late
summer
sessioner
i
like
it
nothing
too
redeeming
for
this
one
its
somewhat
refreshing
in
the
end
but
thats
all
this
one
really
has
going
for
it
ive
tried
two
beers
from
this
brewery
to
date
and
they
both
have
been
busts
for
me
looks
like
they
have
some
hard
work
ahead
of
them
pours
a
bright
golden
color
topped
by
an
ephemeral
wisp
of
creamy
white
head
not
much
aroma
a
little
mild
ale
yeast
and
some
lightly
sweet
malt
palate
is
again
very
delicate
very
light
sweet
malt
a
touch
of
ale
yeast
and
a
barely
detectable
hint
of
hops
body
is
thin
but
not
too
thin
theres
just
not
much
going
on
here
a
good
thirstquencher
on
a
hot
night
but
not
really
much
taste
the
mouthfeel
is
sharp
from
carbonation
very
light
in
body
very
light
sweetness
and
bitterness
play
well
together
and
drop
off
completely
after
a
brief
hint
of
grape
nuts
the
only
thing
this
beer
has
going
for
it
is
its
ease
of
consumption
on
tap
at
the
dirty
truth
in
northampton
ma
appearance
was
a
nice
cloudy
yellow
that
had
a
small
head
but
decent
lacing
smell
improved
as
the
beer
warmed
minly
light
fruity
hop
notes
taste
was
mainly
floral
a
bit
different
more
flowers
than
hops
mouthfeel
is
creamy
and
smooth
at
the
low
abva
decent
drinkability

a
definite
summer
brew

a
rather
good

wheatsaison
at

4
abv
for
the
light

level
this
is
a
fantastically
flavorful
brew
and
makes
for
one
fantastic
session
rather
nice
overall
o
tasty
goes
down
easily
not
too
filling
very
mild
kick
good
representation
of
style
this
is
a
nice
beer
to
pound
down
for
a
long
time
a
good
brew
to
drink
in
the
summer
as
i
look
forward
to
its
release
every
may
it
isnt
the
best
blonde
ale
but
it
sure
is
refreshing
when
its
100
degrees
in
the
salt
lake
high
desert
sun
a
solid
summer
seasonal
by
uinta
brewing
overall
refreshing
and
light
with
a
bit
more
flavor
than
i
was
expecting
a
nice
summer
quaffer
i
think
its
excellent
and
with
an
abv
of
only
4
this
is
a
tasty
little
summer
beer
blonde
ales
are
cousins
to
kolsch
and
this
one
sure
reminds
you
of
that
i
would
say
that
its
only
flaw
is
that
the
bitterness
becomes
a
bit
much
as
it
lingers
rather
bland
and
uninteresting
o
plenty
of
flavor
for
4
although
daytoday
i
rather
have
a
low
abv
pils
like
troegs
sunshine
pils
or
pilsner
urquell
id
also
take
21st
amendment
bitter
american
over
this
keeping
in
mind
they
all
have
about
10
more
alcohol
still
this
is
a
good
beer
and
ill
have
it
again
one
things
for
sure
uinta
has
done
a
fine
job
of
capturing
the
taste
of
summer
and
the
sun
in
a
bottle
overall
a
solid
refreshing
ale
available
in
a
can
that
delivers
a
fair
amount
of
flavor
in
contrast
to
its
low
alcohol
o
easy
to
drink
sessionable

lemongrass
was
certainly
a

frankly
it
reminded
me
more
of
a
pilsner
than
a
blonde

was
very
soft
caressing
my
poor
bruised

and
washing
it
with
a
lemony
biscuity

i
stand
behind
thinking
of
it
as
a
german

semidry

its

who

no

a

then
expected
a
refreshing
beer
really
easy
drinker
overall
a
good
beer
that
is
done
well
really
great
summer
beer
but
i
could
have
these
all
year
round
poured
from
a
bottle
into
a
shaker
pint
the
beer
is
a
bright
extremely
light
goldenwheat
color

a
ton
of
carbonation
throughout
the
body
and
a
sparse

ale
an
easy
drinker
overall
unless
you
are
looking
for
the
low
abv
you
should
pass
on
this
beer
overall
definitely
has
the
feel
that
a
summer
beer
should
chewy
creamy
malt
with
light
springy
hops
good
for
a
hot
day
on
the
porch
poured
into

pint
glass
clear
golden
yellow
with
a
medium
white
head
that
sticks
around
with
lots
of
foam
and
lacing
smell
is
lots
of
crackery
malt
and
just
a
hint
of
citrus
and
grassy
crisp
hops
taste
is
delicious
crisp
clean
body
of
biscuity
malt
with
a
perfect
pinch
of
juicy
citrus
and
crisp
hops
another
great
session
beet
from
uinta
overall
a
pretty
good
ale
one
that
i
would
revisit
in
the
right
circumstances
its
light
drinkable
and
has
the
refreshing
quality
a
summer
ale
needs
to
have
not
too
bad
at
all
the
taste
is
upfront
grainy
but
there
are
enough
clean
hops
to
balance
it
off
also
that
lemon
citrus
activity
is
mellow
but
adds
to
the
character
the
aroma
is
ok
but
nothing
to
write
home
about
a
slight
finishing
hops
aroma
nice
but
subtle
the
taste
is
a
refreshing
blandness
not
very
anything
similarly
the
aftertaste
is
nothing
either
it
is
something
good
to
wash
food
down
with
or
to
drink
many
of
on
a
hot
day
barely
medium
in
body
its
got
more
heft
than
many
blondes
its
also
got
a
hard
bite
of
crispness
all
the
way
through
without
giving
up
smoothness
a
gently
herbal
edge
gives
a
little
dryness
going
into
the
finish
o
a
nice
little
summer
beer
very
easy
to
drink
dare
i
say
session
and
a
nice
value
too
a
good
amount
of
flavor
for
a
4
beer
to
boot
worth
a
try
i
picked
up
a
bunch
of
different
beer
for
the
annual
july
4th
bbq
i
really
enjoyed
this
easy
drinker
it
was
refreshing
and
just
was
plain
ol
good
it
was
out
of
a
can
icy
icy
cold
i
could
sit
and
while
an
afternoon
away
with
the
wife
in
the
hammock
and
a
sumr
low
c
o
tough
to
rate
considering
style
for
what
this
beer
is
brewed
for
its
excellent
easy
drinking
and
sessionable
while
providing
a
complementary
depth
of
character
to
keep
it
interesting
i
could
certainly
drink
this
all
day
well
done
blonde
ale
how
fast
do
you
have
to
speak
in
order
to
pronounce
this
beer
the
way
its
written
anyway
this
stuff
pours
a
clear
pale
straw
topped
by
a
finger
of
bone
foam
the
nose
comprises
sweet
lemon
peel
very
light
biscuit
and
a
hint
of
mint
the
taste
holds
notes
of
thoroughly
funky
lemon
peel
light
wheat
a
pinch
of
coriander
and
a
single
miniature
crystal
of
belgian
candi
sugar
the
body
is
pretty
light
with
a
light
moderate
carbonation
and
a
slightly
watery
feel
overall
this
beer
just
didnt
quite
do
it
for
me
i
get
that
its
meant
to
be
light
and
refreshing
for
the
warmer
months
and
whatnot
but
its
just
too
thin
too
light
too
insubstantial
to
really
work
and
the
sorachi
hops
which
actually
can
work
at
times
dont
express
themselves
well
enough
due
mostly
to
a
lack
of
support
you
can
have
an
awesome
quarterback
but
if
hes
got
no
one
to
throw
to
o
this
is
an
easy
drinking
beer
that
is
big
on
flavor
and
at
4
abv
i
could
knock
back
a
bunch
of
these
on
a
hot
summer
day
wonderful
beer
man
this
is
kind
of
an
oddly
sweet
beer
at
first
i
was
thinking
what
the
heck
and
i
was
also
thinking
do
i
need
to
get
milk
tomorrow
actually
that
last
part
is
a
lie
the
beer
does
seem
to
have
a
defined
sweet
tone
to
it
in
a
malty
kind
of
way
but
also
in
a
way
that
brings
grain
tones
into
the
mix
as
well
hearty
ones
but
not
in
a
way
that
overpowers
things
the
overall
verdict
is
that
this
is
a
pretty
good
blonde
ale
a
bit
thick
and
hearty
for
the
style
but
its
alright
at
least
worth
trying
overall
a
sure
fire
winner
of
a
summer
ale
worth
a
six
pack
a
sitting
this
was
certainly
a
pretty
hoppy
take
on
an
american
blonde
and
i
didnt
mind
one
bit
this
was
flavorful
crisp
and
light
on
the
palate
making
for
a
pleasant
drinkable
experience
uinta
has
been
doing
nicely
for
me
this
summer
with
these
quaffable
lighter
beers
pours
a
hazy
light
yellow
with
a
1
inch
foamy
white
head
that
settles
to
a
film
on
top
of
the
beer
foamy
rings
of
lace
line
the
glass
on
the
drink
down
smell
is
of
maltgrain
and
some
mild
grassy
and
hay
aromas
taste
is
of
maltgrain
grass
and
some
herbal
hop
flavors
on
the
finish
there
is
a
medium
amount
of
hop
bitterness
on
the
palate
with
each
sip
this
beer
has
a
good
level
of
carbonation
with
a
crisp
mouthfeel
overall
this
is
a
pretty
good
beer
that
is
easy
to
drink
but
the
aroma
is
a
bit
weak
in
my
opinion
from
the
12
oz
bottle
purchased
at
emigration
market
in
salt
lake
check
out
their
selection
of
utah
singles
odan
unbelievably
forgettable
summer
blonde
that
is
nearly
11
for
a
six
pack
quite
an
incognito
brew
with
a
soggy
price
tag
my
lack
of
success
with
summer
seasonals
continues
not
a
style
i
would
go
to
often
but
i
was
grilling
yesterday
and
this
was
nice
to
have
all
afternoon
poured
into
a
standard
pint
glass
a
clear
lemon
tinged
light
golden
with
a
thinner
white
head
atop
the
aromas
were
actually
quite
complex
with
lemony
hopstoasted
cereal
grainand
a
hint
of
biscuit
lighter
mouthfeel
was
expected
but
it
didnt
deter
much
from
the
beerbright
lemony
notes
along
with
a
grainy
element
that
lingers
into
a
nice
finish
one
of
the
better
beers
i
can
think
of
if
you
want
a
low
alcohol
but
flavorful
blonde
ale
a
well
done
american
blonde
lots
of
flavor
but
easy
drinking
and
refreshing
pours

slight

a

overall
good
appearance

and
body
o
pretty
good
beer
for
the
sumr
season
gives
a
decent
amount
of
flavor
and
the
light
hops
is
a
nice
finish
would
certainly
share
a
few
over
a
barbecue
o
decent
beer
would
be
great
in
the
summer
the
only
real
complaint
is
the
excessive
use
of
malt
overall
much
better
the
second
night
out
of
the
growler
o
good
not
but
not
great
i
wouldnt
buy
again
over
the
wasatch
kolesch
nothing
more
then
expected
decent
summer
quaffer
while
i
appreciate
the
crispness
dryness
and
low
alcohol
content
the
flavors
are
so
offputting
that
i
found
this
to
be
most
unpleasant
however
i
feel
that
this
isnt
a
poorly
crafted
ale
hence
i
cannot
legitimately
rate
it
lower
despite
my
near
thorough
unenjoyment
overall
a
very
light
refreshing
beer
to
be
enjoyed
on
a
nice
hot
day
low
alcohol
allows
you
to
partake
on
a
few
while
working
outdoors
notes
a
couple
of
months
since
bottling
so
maybe
on
a
fresher
version
the
sorachi
might
shine
more
on
the
nose
and
palate
still
it
is
still
holding
up
pretty
well
last
year
i
was
curious
to
try
it
and
this
time
i
did
not
want
to
let
it
go
by
despite
the
pricing
too
expensive
for
what
it
is
otherwise
this
would
make
for
a
fine
easy
social
refreshing
ale

is

o
i
could
definitely
see
myself
drinking
a
few
of
these
under
the
hot

never
been
to
utah
but
id
assume
this
would
be
perfect
when
its

nice
one
do
the
lightest
ales
are
a
simple
pleasure
when
they
are
served
in
a
seasonally
appropriate
fashionwhen
refreshment
becomes
a
bigger
part
of
why
we
drink
this
beer
is
no
exception
with
the
ability
to
quench
a
powerful
thirst
and
still
provide
an
interesting
if
understated
display
of
malt
and
hops
overall
not
a
bad
brew
but
also
not
very
interesting
good
tasting
oi
could
drink
this
all
day
o
this
is
a
summer
ale
the
flavours
are
quite
good
and
very
drinkable
not
summer
yet
but
a
low
alcohol
option
to
consider
when
the
hot
days
come
around
d
a
decent
summer
this
one
poured
a
little
warmer
than
proper
so
it
wouldve
been
a
bit
better
poured
into
a
hefe
glass
color
was
a
very
light
pale
straw
with
a
milky
white
head
initially
poured
a
3
finger
head
that
lasted
510
minutes
a
small
1
finger
head
lasted
for
most
of
the
beer
constant
streams
of
carbonation
rose
for
about
15
minutes
aroma
was
slightly
sweet
and
slightly
wheaty
taste
was
very
pleasant
slightly
citrusy
a
tad
sweet
a
tad
of
hoppy
bitterness
but
very
balanced
felt
ok
in
the
mouth
slightly
over
bitter
on
the
toungue
but
coated
well
and
felt
solid
a
nice
summer
beer
definitely
worth
drinking
mouthfeel
is
light
with
a
crisp
amount
of
carbonation
a
refreshing
tasty
and
fresh
blonde
ale
the
best
one
so
far
for
me
the
highlyrefreshing
drink
is
lightbodied
and
thoroughly
carbonated
but
not
at
all
obnoxiously
so
highly
quaffable
thanks
to
wasatch
for
the
bottle
pours
an
almost
clear
straw
with
a
chill
haze
forming
quickly
as
the
near
purewhite
onefinger
head
dissipating
into
a
bubbly
froth
crisp
malts
light
fruits
and
near
indiscernible
hops
all
float
to
the
nose
a
bit
dry
going
down
with
some
malts
a
surprising
hoppiness
and
a
good
somewhat
delayed
fruit
hit
at
the
end
lightbodied
and
highly
drinkable
but
still
tasty
which
is
what
i
look
for
in
a
good
summer
sessioner
could
polish
a
few
of
these
off
easily
if
i
had
access
to
em
thanks
john
an
ideal
summer
brew
crisp
clean
and
extremely
refreshing
light
in

but
not
in
flavor
great
for
a
nice
session
on
the
deck
into
the
evening
hours

the

medium

drinkable
another
organic
brew
from
four
bitter
middle
of
the
road
o
recommended
for
hop
heads
who
favor
piney
hops
and
plenty
of
grapefruity
bitterness
i
appreciated
the
american
pale
ale
and
it
was
a
good
representation
of
the
style
as
it
was
wellbalanced
i
would
try
it
again
and
pair
it
with
a
dish
like
a
steak
salad
which
i
imagine
would
cut
the
fattiness
and
complement
the
citrus
i
agree
with
bierjager89
but
i
like
it
because
it
is
a
spring
brew
it
should
be
lighter
great
for
a
seattle
spring
day
this
would
be
good
for
any
social
gathering
celebrating
the
pnw
spring
and
a
great
time
to
see
how
friends
like
it
it
really
helps
to
try
this
one
on
a
real
spring
day
especially
after
drinking
all
those
fine
winter
ales
o
it
was
a
bit
light
for
my
taste
and
the
taste
was
not
what
i
was
hoping
for
and
a
bit
disappointing
after
the
nose
still
worth
a
try
overall
not
a
bad
brew
but
seems
a
little
off
for
this
style
not
bad
in
general
though
just
a
quick
review
of
this
beer
i
was
in
awe
by
the
color
it
was
a
deep
beautiful
orange
i
was
expecting
it
to
be
a
much
more
pale
beer
the
smell
was
floral
and
hoppy
without
much
else
being
present
thats
how
it
drank
as
well
pretty
simple
basic
pale
ale
i
could
see
myself
drinking
these
pretty
easily
but
not
a
beer
id
go
out
of
my
way
to
find
an
interesting
pale
ale
or
blonde
or
whatever
you
want
to
call
it
it
seems
more
of
an
english
take
on
the
style
and
with
that
in
mind
is
quite
pleasant
overall
a
pretty
good
beer
some
of
the
beers
from
this
brewery
are
a
bit
hoppy
for
my
taste
but
this
one
is
pretty
close
to
what
i
prefer
its
also
a
bit
more
alelike
than
some
other
blonde
ales
that
ive
tried
pours
a
dark
blonde
color
with
a
little
white
head
on
top
smells
super
citrusy
yet
full
malts
come
through
in
the
nose
as
well
the
typical
white
grapefruit
and
evergreen
hop
tastes
that
we
associate
with
ninkasi
are
not
restrained
in
this
brew
some
roasted
flavors
combined
with
caramel
and
pale
malts
to
provide
a
much
stronger
grain
presence
and
bigger
body
than
most
blondes
this
one
is
an
american
blonde
that
is
not
wimpy
one
shade
blonder
than
snpa
with
a
hint
of
classic
ninkasi
amazingly
refreshing
and
complex
for
what
it
is
supposed
to
be
the
palate
opens
moderately
bitter
and
surprisingly
astringent
it
drinks
closer
to
an
apa
than
a
blonde
ale
with
the
bitterness
being
fresh
pungent
and
with
a
blend
of
a
german
herbalmintyspicy
hop
flavors
and
a
secondary
american
citrus
character
the
malt
character
is
less
noticeable
here
with
a
blend
of
biscuit
and
toast
mildly
sweet
and
moderately
oily
on
the
finish
this
beer
is
mediumlight
in
body
and
slightly
overcarbonated
the
finish
has
a
lingering
bitterness
thats
quite
pleasing
with
an
herbalminty
character
alcohol
is
wellhidden
but
in
all
honesty
theres
no
reason
this
beer
couldnt
be
brewed
at
4
5
just
look
at
victorys
summer
love
which
combines
german
hops
and
a
blonde
ale
remarkably
well
solid
o
a
pretty
dull
beer
with
unpleasant
bitter
earthy
notes
poured
into
a
dogfish
head
pint
glass
pours
a
medium
golden
amber
with
a
half
finger
white
head
with
good
retention
and
lacing
aroma
of
lightly
toasted
and
biscuit
malt
faint
hops
reminiscent
of
a
light
pilsner
flavor
of
mild
bready
and
biscuit
malt
sligthly
nutty
finishing
with
dry
bittering
hops
with
light
herabl
notes
medium
bodied
flavors
are
appropriate
for
a
light
spring
ale
but
nothing
really
stands
out
and
could
use
slightly
more
hop
flavor
to
balance
the
bitterness
in
the
finish
a
nice
dinner
beer
with
pleasant
maltiness
overall
this
is
a
perfect
spring
beer
i
would
definitely
try
this
beer
again
such
a
great
blend
of
bitter
floral
citric
hops
and
sweet
caramel
malt
notes
the
only
thing
keeping
it
back
are
some
astringent
characters
towards
the
aftertaste
im
overlooking
this
since
im
really
enjoying
the
beer
overall
i
dont
know
that
this
fits
your
classic
description
of
an
american
blonde
the
flavor
hits
much
closer
to
an
american
pale
to
me
regardless
its
another
solid
effort
from
ninkasi
and
a
definite
winner
for
a
spring
seasonal
release
poured
from
a
650ml
bottle
pours
a
deep
yellow
with
orange
highlights
nose
has
lots
of
lemony
hops
very
fresh
and
clean
smelling
taste
is
similar
with
lemon
hop
notes
right
up
front
theres
good
strong
bitterness
and
generic
malty
sweetness
as
well
tastes
a
bit
like
an
ale
version
of
a
maibock
overallcomments
this
was
my
first
time
having
this
and
i
came
away
thinking
that
this
would
be
a
very
solid
choice
in
late
springearly
summer
another
solid
beer
from
ninkasi
classified
as
an
american
blond
ale
at
6
abv
spring
seasonal
release
reviewed
and
consumed
92012
a
bright
wellbalanced
ale
tasty
and
nicely
hopped
for
a
blonde
probably
best
in
spring
but
also
thoroughly
enjoyable
in
the
summer
when
i
had
it
o
weird
and
ultimately
below
average
rendition
of
the
style
id
recommend
only
if
you
like
ninkasi
or
hoppy
blonde
ales
odecent
blonde
ale
with
good
flavor
would
be
a
decent
session
beer
o
this
one
didnt
have
too
much
going
on
but
it
was
enjoyable
as
the
temperature
was
getting
warmer
simple
but
it
keeps
you
interested
the
carbonation
is
just
high
enough
to
really
make
those
citrus
hop
notes
sing
and
be
really
refreshing
overall
it
is
a
little
unbalanced
and
doesnt
seem
to
match
the
style
it
claims
but
i
really
like
it
nonetheless
would
love
to
try
it
again
fresh
it
is
probably
on
the
edge
of
its
style
but
that
only
makes
me
like
it
a
little
more
a
little
confused
with
the
abrupt
changes
from
honey
to
hops
and
back
again
but
definitely
worth
a
sixer
deep
golden
color
with
a
white
head
that
dissipated
slowly
leaving
lacing
on
the
glass
aroma
of
toasted
and
biscuitlike
malts
with
some
faint
floral
hops
flavor
very
similar
to
aroma
but
i
didnt
detect
the
hops
at
the
beginning
of
the
taste
its
light
to
medium
bodied
and
has
a
a
crisp
effervescent
mouth
feel
it
tastes
and
drinks
like
a
pilsner
lager
it
finishes
dry
with
an
earthy
hop
bitterness
overall
spring
reign
is
more
malty
than
hoppy
cheers
a
balanced
sessionable
ale
with
just
a
touch
of
hop
great
summer
beer
purchased
at
full
throttle
bottles
in
georgetown
seattle
22
oz
pours
a
nice
amber
color
and
is
fairly
clear
good
frothy
head
out
of
the
bomber
with
lacing
malty
finish
with
come
caramel
notes
nice
fresh
spicy
finish
and
springlike
hence
the
name
the
label
claims
this
is
drinkable
a
session
beer
but
given
the
abv
and
ibus
i
cant
agree
this
was
a
little
hoppier
than
other
blonde
ales
ive
had
that
wasnt
really
a
bad
thing
though
i
thought
it
was
more
of
a
pale
ale
than
anything
else
as
i
didnt
detect
much
malts
in
the
taste
it
had
a
fruityhoppy
smell
with
a
little
malt
in
the
end
its
not
a
beer
that
explodes
in
my
mouth
but
it
is
nice
for
the
hot
summer
days
pours
light
and
blonde
and
drinks
like
a
forgettable
ale
the
hops
show
up
but
dont
really
make
a
statement
and
the
beer
seems
over
carbonated
i
know
this
is
a
entry
level
type
beer
but
i
expected
more
from
these
guys
especially
for
a
seasonal
in
a
bomber
all
in
all
a
very
nice
21st
take
on
an
old
school
west
coast
ale
ninkasi
should
consider
making
it
year
round
the
mouthfeel
is
medium
bodied
for
the
style
and
carbonation
is
moderate
overall
it
was
a
pretty
easy
drinking
and
flavorful
beer
it
wasnt
anything
outstanding
but
was
pretty
decent
the
flavors
were
pretty
well
balanced
in
the
taste
as
well
decent
beer
overall
o
mild
but
flavorable
nice
balance
d
drinks
light
slight
bitterness
d
ive
been
very
impressed
with
most
of
ninkasis
brews
id
give
this
beer
another
shot
and
just
hope
i
got
a
bad
bottle
not
a
bad
brew
can
see
what
theyre
doing
and
its
been
done
pretty
successfully
if
not
outstandingly
a
decent
brew
clean
fresh
bright
and
drinkable
without
being
all
that
exciting
but
im
very
happy
to
have
some
unexcitingly
quaffable
beer
on
the
roster
and
ninkasi
again
delivers
on
that
im
not
really
sure
what
an
american
blonde
ale
is
supposed
to
be
other
than
a
marketing
gimmick
i
feel
its
too
hoppy
for
the
style
and
consequently
would
make
a
better
pale
ale
not
a
bad
beer
at
all
so
this
is
a
matter
of
taste
but
it
seems
like
sharp
highly
hopped
ales
should
be
in
the
pale
ale
category
really
a
nice
beer
for
what
its
supposed
to
be
seems
to
be
a
nice
light
session
beer
to
help
celebrate
the
warmer
weather
spot
on
boys
keep
up
the
great
work
appearance
is
a
light
golden
amber
with
a
thin
head
that
leaves
a
fair
lace
smell
is
light
but
floral
hops
are
there
with
malt
in
the
back
taste
has
a
strong
grapefruit
bitter
that
seems
out
of
balance
with
the
roasted
malts
mouthfeel
is
medium
with
good
carbonation
they
call
this
blonde
a
session
ale
on
the
bottle
but
to
me
its
more
towards
an
ipa
o
solid
spring
ale
from
ninkasi
no
real
complaints
here
good
drinkability
really
refreshing
drinks
pretty
good
for
the
style
not
a
huge
hit
with
me
but
an
easy
going
summerdrinker
the
overly
toasted
malt
character
detracts
a
bit
from
the
overall
package
for
me
but
its
a
nice
drinkable
bland
with
a
healthy
grassy
hop
profile
o
at
6
abv
this
is
not
quite
the
session
beer
it
claims
to
be
but
its
very
easy
to
drink
and
tastes
pretty
good
wouldnt
turn
down
a
free
pint
but
its
not

not

going

here
fairly

not
very
impressed
my
least
favorite
of
ninkasi
offerings
to
date
drink
its
below
average
and
i
expected
more
i
had
heard
good
things
about
ninkasi
but
think
i
need
to
try
their
regular
line
up
before
i
write
them
off
drinkability
easily
quaffable
and
that
is
exactly
what
im
doing
on
such
an
annoyingly
hot
day
upper
80s
right
now
was
90s
earlier
thanks
for
the
great
extra
d
finally
found
a
ninkasi
that
i
dont
like
this
was
a
drain
pour
loads
of
carbonation
in
this
beer
it
looks
like
a
spring
blonde
ale
should
look
like
light
and
crisp
the
color
is
golden
yellow
or
blonde
if
you
will
it
is
a
little
hazy
you
cant
see
through
it
really
at
all
which
is
surprisingly
nice
the
head
is
a
nice
two
fingers
and
it
is
sticking
around
for
a
while
it
looks
fluffy
and
pillowy
and
completely
white
the
appearance
on
this
is
pretty
impressive
the
smell
is
nice
it
smells
like
spring
it
just
smells
super
refreshing
and
nice
and
crisp
it
has
a
nice
light
hop
smell
and
a
sweet
malty
finish
on
the
smell
as
well
it
also
smells
a
little
citrusy
and
it
might
have
some
floral
notes
as
well
a
little
complex
but
not
too
much
on
the
smell
either
way
it
smells
nice
not
as
much
flavor
as
i
would
have
liked
on
the
taste
the
hops
and
malts
are
really
skimping
out
on
this
beer
i
mean
that
is
kinda
to
be
expected
because
it
is
a
blonde
ale
but
its
a
little
more
than
i
would
have
liked
on
the
plus
side
it
is
very
refreshing
and
it
has
some
nice
citrus
characteristics
and
some
flowery
taste
to
it
it
tastes
like
spring
to
me
which
is
really
nice
i
just
wish
there
was
more
of
that
flavor
all
around
overall
tasty
but
i
wish
they
increased
all
the
flavors
one
notch
mouthfeel
is
pretty
good
normal
for
a
blonde
ale
and
the
drinkability
is
very
high
higher
than
i
should
give
it
credit
for
the
taste
would
indicate
low
drinkability
but
since
i
want
more
of
that
flavor
that
im
only
getting
a
little
bit
of
and
because
its
very
crisp
and
refreshing
it
just
makes
me
want
more
and
more
of
it
overall
a
well
done
beer
not
too
impressive
on
the
taste
but
it
is
so
crisp
and
refreshing
that
it
makes
me
want
to
give
it
a
good
grade
this
might
be
a
spring
seasonal
but
man
this
would
be
perfect
for
a
warm
summer
day
well
done
ninkasi
i
am
fan
good
stuff
a
real
beers
beer
as
i
like
to
say
not
something
that
an
old
redneck
would
think
was
to
froofyfroofy
but
still
tasty
i
approve
d
an
easy
beer
to
drink
a
lot
of
its
lagerlike
characteristic
smoothness
is
made
much
more
enjoyable
imo
by
its
strong
hoppiness
for
the
style
making
this
an
above
average
session
beer
i
remember
this
beer
with
more
pale
malt
and
not
so
much
of
that
hangaround
dry
bitterness
rating
drinkability
purely
on
a
typical
blonde
ale
being
fairly
middleofthe
road
id
go
only
a
3
but
pretend
its
an
ipa
and
its
an
easy
4
and
still

for

you
cant
go
wrong
check
it
out
d
pretty
good
and
decently
balanced
but
you
have
to
think
of
this
as
either
an
amber
or
pale
ale
then
you
get
it
i
rate
this
one
a
solid
good
and
would
recommend
it
to
anyone
curious
about
trying
a
slightly
bitter
hoppy
beer
drinkability
i
liked
the
sharp
personality
of
the
flavors
but
it
just
didnt
go
down
well
for
a
beer
trying
to
fill
the
sessionable
bill
drinkable
and
a
little
unusual
for
the
style
more
body
and
bitterness
than
expected
i
would
have
this
again
in
season
i
just
dont
understand
what
ninkasi
was
trying
to
do
with
this
one
the
beer
is
at
best
unoffensive
but
theres
no
complexity
poor
balance
and
well
it
just
doesnt
taste
that
great
an
ok
beer
but
nothing
special
tastes
like
a
watered
down
stone
arrogant
bastard
coarse
and
grainy
in
flavor
with
a
return
of
lemonorange
citrus
that
lingers
through
the
finish
and
accompanies
some
lightly
toasted
grain
offers
a
moderate
body
for
the
style
given
its
texture
with
a
good
balance
of
background
citric
sweetness
though
not
bitter
by
any
means
rather
heavy
in
character
for
a
blonde
ale
adding
some
depth
to
the
style
nice
drinkability
overall
and
rather
dry
on
the
finish
yet
a
firm
carbonation
holds
up
to
give
the
beer
a
creamy
feel
tastes
like
theres
a
fair
amount
of
wheat
in
the
mix
d
i
can
easily
put
down
a
22oz
and
would
enjoy
a
2nd
during
a
long
afternoon
or
bbq
not
a
fan
d
solid
stuff
one
of
the
cheapest
new
bombers
ive
seen
in
a
while
a
nice
brew
for
spring
d
pretty
good
although
a
blonde
it
is
not
a
pale
more
like
it
overall
this
is
a
nice
spring
ale
as
they
call
it
that
will
probably
appeal
to
fans
of
pale
ale
and
mellower
ipas
it
may
be
raining
here
in
wa
but
this
brew
already
has
me
in
the
spring
mood
lol
this
beer
is
a
clear
copperamber
color
with
a
centimeter
of
resilient
sticky
foam
the
aroma
combines
caramel
malt
and
flowery
hops
the
body
is
medium
in
body
as
sweet
and
grainy
malt
spill
into
a
moist
center
the
mixture
of
hops
is
pleasant
with
both
pine
and
citrus
notes
this
is
a
nice
drinkable
beer
i
am
not
sure
about
the
american
blonde
ale
category
though
this
beer
reminds
me
more
of
an
american
pale
ale
the
body
was
typical
for
the
style
as
was
drinkability
overall
a
decent
beer
worth
a
shot
if
you
see
it
next
review
d
pretty
drinkable
the
dry
finish
keeps
you
coming
back
for
more
and
the
flavors
are
nice
just
needs
to
be
balanced
spring
reign
ale
is
at
least
as
good
as
radiant
summer
ale
why
stop
there
ninkasi
give
us
something
for
the
autumn
and
winter
seasons
that
is
just
as
hoppy
and
just
as
good
more
hoppy
and
better
would
work
too
this
beer
reminds
me
quite
a
lot
of
bridgeport
ipa
actually
had
this
in
a
bottle
and
also
at
the
klcc
brewfest
in
february
around
its
debut
time
it
pours
out
a
light
not
quite
opaque
yellowbrown
color
with
a
white
head
looks
like
itll
be
refreshing
though
theres
not
much
of
a
smell
to
it
the
taste
is
dominated
by
the
malt
which
tastes
a
bit
like
straw
and
a
bit
like
bread
not
a
hop
taste
to
be
found
though
no
taste
of
alcohol
either
its
ok
when
its
very
cold
but
as
it
warms
up
it
becomes
even
stranger
tasting
not
the
best
of
ninkasis
spectacular
line
of
beers
the
aroma
was
biscuity
with
a
hint
of
noble
the
taste
was
sharp
and
it
finished
creamy
definitely
got
the
idea
that
this
was
mostly
malt
dominated
brew
out
of
the
few
that
i
have
tried
of
this
style
it
is
tops
on
the
end
of
the
drink
you
get
a
nice
bitterness
that
is
light
on
the
palate
overall
this
seasonal
is
well
worth
trying
out
pours
a
hazy
orangishgold
color
with
a
frothy
white
head
that
turns
to
a
light
ring
around
the
glass
aroma
is
of
caramel
slight
citrus
and
a
touch
of
butterdiacetyl
but
it
isnt
that
vibrant
flavor
mirrors
the
aroma
except
for
more
citrus
hops
with
some
toasty
malts
its
a
light
bodied
beer
that
is
slick
because
of
the
present
diacetyl
its
a
decent
beer
out
of
the
bottle
but
the
tap
version
was
seemed
much
fresher
and
more
flavorful
aroma
is
a
bit
woody
some
straw
and
a
bit
of
metallic
hop
spice
some
diacetylbuttery
flavors
in
here
bleh
some
dms
cooked
veggies
too
some
grapenut
graininess
it
aint
bad
but
its
nothing
outstanding
im
glad
to
see
ninkasi
has
fixed
their
spoiled
bottle
issues
and
such
though
this
js
just
a
standard
blondegoldenpa
nothing
really
off
or
really
exceptional
overall
impression
nice
sessionable
beer
a
lot
more
interesting
than
i
expected
from
a
blonde
ale
recommended
d
very
drinkable
brew
will
be
enjoying
more
of
this
for
sure
drinkability
is
okay
for
what
it
is
a
strong
pale
ale
but
not
what
i
was
hoping
for
or
expecting
after
reading
the
label
decent
price
at

taste
is
semithick
pine

some
nuts
hops
and
a
few

ends
on
the
dry
side
and
bitter
becomes
more
bitter
as
you
drink
recommend
a
try
at
least
but
not
a
top
pick
especially
from
this
brewer
and
i
am
shooting
myself
for
missing
an
oaked
cask
of
tricerahops
last
night
22
oz
bomber
bright
amberorange
in
colour
good
sized
off
white
head
lots
of
citic
hoppiness
in
the
aroma
backed
by
a
good
malt
flavour
is
very
lemony
orange
hoppiness
bright
and
breezy
though
you
can
tell
the
malt
backing
underneath
is
strong
and
consistent
nice
mouthfeel
great
hoppy
after
taste
very
nice
excellent
strong
pale
light
bodied
with
with
good
carbonation
and
a
dry
mouthfeel
i
couldnt
finish
this
the
metallic
and
medicinal
hop
finish
was
too
much
d
very
easy
to
drink
great
solid
brew
one
of
the
more
flavorful
blondes
out
there
would
make
a
nice
session
beer
nice
seasonal
with
a
nice
northwest
hop
presence
wish
this
stuff
was
available
in
my
neck
of
the
woods
recommended
poured
from
a
22oz
bottle
this
is
the
first
beer
i
have
had
from
ninkasi
and
if
the
label
hadnt
been
so
bright
and
appealing
on
a
crappy
seattle
day
i
might
not
have
picked
it
right
now
i
am
glad
to
have
bought
it
a
slightly
vigorous
pour
gives
it
a
light
amber
orange
color
with
a
2
finger
head
and
a
slight
head
retention
and
good
lacing
smell
is
mostly
fresh
hops
with
a
little
bit
of
light
malt
in
the
background
taste
is
orange
zest
and
floral
hops
with
a
bit
of
roasted
malt
hop
bitterness
lingers
in
the
aftertaste
this
is
a
very
drinkable
beer
and
makes
me
think
of
how
some
of
the
better
pale
ales
out
there
would
be
if
they
were
fresh
from
a
22
ounce
bottle
slightly
hazed
amber
with
one
finger
of
off
white
head
gentle
pour
good
amount
of
lacings
aroma
is
floral
hops
taste
is
citrus
grapefruit
orange
hops
and
strong
support
from
the
sweet
malts
tasted
like
a
nice
west
coast
pale
ale
to
my
palate
easy
drinker
very
smooth
medium
dry
finish
very
fine
spring
beer
i
believe
this
beer
was
quite
fresh
and
it
is
the
first
time
i
have
seen
it
on
the
shelves
in
the
portland
area
d
the
bottle
says
a
session
beer
that
everyone
can
enjoy
i
would
agree
another
great
and
tasty
ninkasi
light
crisp
and
refreshing
could
crush
this
all
day
not
huge
in
the
flavor
department
but
on
a
hot
day
or
while
playing
golf
it
would
do
the
trick
mouthfeel
light
bodied
and
very
lightly
carbonated
a
drying
mouthfeel
from
the
lemon
hop
acidity
is
really
the
only
thing
to
mention
as
none
of
the
flavors
or
even
the
weight
of
the
beer
doesnt
last
long
when
summer
comes
cases
of
golden
ale
are
the
way
to
go
great
year
round
but
perfect
in
the
summer
when
i
have
friends
looking
to
start
drinking
beer
this
is
often
one
of
the
brews
i
suggest
to
start
with
light
malt
light
hops
great
refreshing
taste
wonderful
o
good
work
from
mayflower
here
i
know
this
is
a
yearrounder
but
i
think
the
brewery
would
be
better
served
putting
this
guy
in
12packs
and
marketing
it
for
a
summer
release
overall
exactly
what
i
would
expect
from
a
golden
ale
i
typically
like
a
more
robust
beer
but
sometimes
i
want
something
light
and
crisp
this
is
what
im
looking
for
at
those
times
this
would
be
perfect
on
a
warm
summer
day
after
mowing
the
lawn
or
just
hanging
out
on
the
porch
with
friends
it
was
however
very
clean
and
crisp
from
that
point
of
view
i
think
it
is
a
good
summer
beer
and
still
above
the
large
beer
companies
light
ales
o
a
decent
brew
a
good
alternative
to
other
light
beer
options
id
have
another
although
preferably
in
the
heat
of
the
summer
the
taste
really
reminds
me
of
a
german
pilsener
with
a
slight
hop
bite
with
low
bitterness
lingering
at
the
end
easy
to
drink
but
nothing
out
of
the
ordinary
still
a
good
one
to
have
on
a
hot
day
easydrinking
american
blonde
ale
that
is
fairly
straightforward
overall
mouthfeel
is
nice
very
light
body
moderate
to
full
carbonation
this
is
a
very
wellcrafted
very
light
low
abv
summer
beer
thats
all
that
i
would
recommend
it
for
but
it
is
summer
now
so
enjoy
odi
generally
enjoy
mayflowers
brews
their
spring
hop
is
one
of
my
favorite
local
beers
of
all
time
this
is
a
pleasant
little
brew
that
has
enough
kick
to
keep
me
interested
perfect
for
warm
days
like
today
a
nice
little
brew
wont
light
your
pants
on
fire
but
tasty
is
the
bottomline
here
very
light
golden
color
fast
fading
head
and
lots
of
bubbles
rising
through
the
beer
crisp
clean
aroma
lightly
floral
and
spicy
basically
smells
like
beer
tastes
like
beer
too
drinkable
unremarkable
unmemorable
maybe
would
have
been
a
better
choice
on
a
hot
sunny
afternoon
this
beer
when
poured
has
a
golden
color
body
with
a
nice
fizzy
white
head
the
smell
has
a
nice
grain
smell
to
it
the
taste
is
very
well
balanced
with
hops
and
malt
has
a
little
bit
of
a
minty
taste
on
the
back
of
the
tongue
it
has
a
nice
and
smooth
mouth
feel
and
is
a
easy
drinker
had
this
beer
at
the
brewery
during
a
brewery
tour
pours
a
nice
white
head
and
a
very
clear
golden
body
smells
sweet
and
somewhat
metallic
nice
sweet
malt
flavor
very
light
and
spritzy
mouthfeel
very
drinkable
not
my
favorite
style
but
a
very
good
representation
of
it
i
would
certainly
go
for
this
if
i
want
something
mid
winter
as
a
break
from
the
heavy
stuff
it
would
be
evident
if
there
were
something
amiss
here
and
there
isnt
this
is
a
really
good
beer
for
a
day
at
the
bar
a
tailgate
or
at
home
really
refreshing
and
tasty
o
for
what
it
is
its
good
so
i
should
probably
rate
it
higher
hard
to
get
too
excited
though
honestly
for
the
calories
id
probably
rather
have
a
light
beer
overall
i
generally
wouldnt
get
very
excited
about
a
golden
ale
but
this
brewery
just
doesnt
disappoint
about
as
good
as
it
gets
for
the
style
thanks
dr
jay
its
a
tad
bit
overly
dry
but
true
to
the
style
so
cant
fault
it
there
nice
session
brew
d
drinks
very
well
low
abv
makes
this
one
sessionable
i
could
easily
drink
a
few
of
these
the
cpj
d
a
good
blonde
ale
its
always
nice
when
a
hohum
style
impresses
on
the
plus
side
the
ale
has
moderate
alcohol
as
well
stylewise
mayflower
amped
it
up
enough
to
bring
it
from
potentially
mundane
to
a
killer
session
ale
this
is
my
favorite
anytime
beer
great
for
bbqs
and
parties
i
love
that
i
can
share
it
with
the
bmc
crowd
and
not
be
called
a
wuss
d
a
good
bbq
beer
the
beer
pours
a
pale
gold
color
with
a
thick
frothy
white
head
that
slowly
fades
to
lacing
the
aroma
is
decent
it
has
a
light
pale
malt
scent
wit
low
hops
and
a
clean
finish
not
much
else
to
say
the
taste
is
good
it
has
a
crisp
and
somewhat
grainy
pale
malt
flavor
that
goes
down
easy
and
finishes
clean
with
little
hop
character
i
definitely
not
a
complex
beer
but
its
a
damn
drinkable
one
with
no
flaws
the
mouthfeel
is
fine
it
is
a
low
bodied
beer
with
good
carbonation
this
is
a
smooth
quaffable
session
ale
well
done
in
conclusion
another
solid
product
from
mayflower
d
crsip
clean
and
refreshing
lots
of
flavor
for
such
a
low
abv
i
can
certainly
see
taking
a
few
down
overall
i
would
buy
this
reasonably
priced
6pack
again
to
support
the
brewery
the
product
is
nothing
exceptional
but
it
is
a
very
serviceable
and
certainly
not
unpleasant
warm
weather
refreshing
beer
pours
a
four

acton
ma
i
wouldnt
say
that
this
ale
is
anything
special

it
is
a

d
this
was
a
crazy

beer
i
had
no
problem
drinking
this
all
in
a
short
time
as
well
this
beer
is
really
easy
to
drink
and
with
a
lower
abv
this
means
i
could
drink
this
all
night
mouthdrink
this
one
goes
down
easy
and
drinks
nicely
a
good
session
beer
i
always
get
a
couple
of
sixers
of
this
stuff
during
the
summer
a
great
gateway
brew
similar
to
ciscos
sankaty
light
drinkability
this
beer
was
gone
before
i
realized
it
i
can
not
wait
to
drink
this
in
the
summertime
d
could
drink
it
all
day
and
not
remember
it
mayflower
blonde
ale
is
a
pretty
impressive
beer
from
a
brewery
that
i
hadnt
heard
of
prior
to
my
trade
with
damienblack
thanks
man
its
a
good
drinker
that
almost
earns
the
next
highest
flavor
score
bottom
line
as
solid
as
plymouth
rock
not
really
my
thing
but
a
pretty
clean
brew
feh
not
worth
the
bother
mayflowers
duplication
of
watery
thin
tart
bad
lager
you
dont
need
anything
special
for
that
if
thats
what
you
want
save
the
and
buy
a
six
of
bud
otherwise
if
you
want
a
nice
light
beer
from
eastern
mass
buy
mayflower
pale
ale
or
something
from
haverhill
eh
it
was
better
than
miller
but
not
by
a
huge
margin
very
drinkable
however
i
wouldnt
say
no
but
i
wont
seek
it
out
d
this
is
a
good
ale
a
nice
sessionable
summer
brew
a
clean
nondescript
blonde
ale
hot
summer
better
than
lawnmower
beer
decent
but
barely
a
step
above
some
of
the
macros
out
there
i
was
pretty
exited
to
try
this
because
i
really
like
mayflowers
ipa
and
pale
ale
but
it
didnt
quite
live
up
to
the
hype
i
poured
it
into
a
glass
and
it
does
have
a
nice
golden
color
but
its
pretty
average
from
that
point
on
it
smells
like
any
basic
macro
brew
beer
while
having
a
very
bland
taste
almost
kind
of
watered
down
probably
would
be
pretty
refreshing
on
a
hot
day
to
go
with
a
light
snack
but
other
than
that
i
wouldnt
really
recommend
it
id
stick
with
one
of
mayflowers
other
brews
it
seems
tasty
but
its
mild
and
exceedingly
drinkable
not
particularly
exciting
but
solid
not
much
for
carbonation
and
the
flavor
isnt
strong
but
a
solid
offering
that
disappears
quickly
i
think
i
like
it
but
i
may
need
to
test
another
one
put
this
in
your
fridge
for
people
new
to
craft
brew
break
it
out
when
someone
asks
for
a
pbr
or
a
coors
if
they
like
it
recommend
mayflower
as
a
brand
and
suggest
they
try
the
pale
ale
next
you
may
just
get

o
aside
from
being
a
little
overcarbonated
i
really
enjoyed
this
beer
nice
to
drink
while
sitting
in
a
lawn
chair
its
certainly
a
thirst
quencher
and
would
go
great
with
spicy
foods
like
mexican
curry
etc
pretty
much
as
clean
and
well
constructed
as
a
blonde
ale
is
going
to
get
the
honey
and
biscuit
malt
gets
to
be
a
bit
much
as
it
warms
clean
mineral
finish
and
light
airy
hops
are
just
about
perfect
rating
to
style
this
one
gets
a
high
grade
o
very
solid
blonde
ale
if
there
were
just
a
bit
more
complexity
on
the
nose
and
in
the
mouth
it
would
be
an
outstanding
example
of
the
style
this
beer
is
medium
to
light
bodied
it
doesnt
leave
any
residue
but
is
rather
dry
on
the
finish
it
will
dry
your
tongue
out
to
a
point
where
it
almost
feels
as
though
its
leaving
something
behind

d
this

is

drinkable
its
tasty
and
refreshing
no
problems
at
all
simply
great
pours
a
murky
light
orange
with
a
foamy
tan
head
that
fades
to
nothing
small
dots
of
lace
slowly
drip
into
the
remaining
beer
on
the
drink
down
smell
is
of
malt
grain
and
grassy
aromas
taste
is
much
the
same
with
grain
fruit
and
grassy
flavors
on
the
finish
there
is
a
mild
amount
of
hop
bitterness
on
the
palate
that
lingers
long
after
each
sip
this
beer
has
a
lower
level
of
carbonation
with
a
slightly
crisp
mouthfeel
overall
this
is
a
pretty
good
beer
that
is
drinkable
and
refreshing
on
draft
at
hops
and
pie
6
pint
this
was
listed
as
a
kolsch
on
the
menu
aroma
was
slightly
fruity
i
guess
it
could
be
a
kolsch
flavor
lacked
the
crispness
i
would
expect
and
also
had
a
sort
of
dirty
quality
that
may
have
been
the
malts
i
didnt
much
care
for
this
and
im
not
sure
how
close
this
hews
to
the
style
overall
this
is
an
interesting
experience
of
highs
and
lows
but
ultimately
taste
wins
out
mission
hits
the
market
with
a
fine
kolschstyle
ale
which
is
characterful
enough
to
appease
the
craft
beer
crowds
but
uses
enough
finesse
to
win
over
adjunct
lager
buyers
with
ease
its
a
wonderful
ale
thats
very
forgiving
with
food
and
mood
ranges
this
stood
out
for
me
carbonation
give
a
bit
of
a
prickly
feel
while
remaining
pretty
fluffy
crisp
yes
and
moderately
smooth
at
least
the
mouthfeel
isnt
off
i
dont
dislike
this
but
i
dont
know
if
id
have
it
again
the
flavor
isnt
bad
there
just
isnt
much
there
overall
it
is
a
very
drinkable
beer
for
summer
i
would
buy
again
actually
self
titled
a
kolsch
this
is
more
of
a
german
american
hybrid
it
pours
a
mostly
clear
golden
blond
color
with
just
a
thin
head
that
fades
fast
nothing
special
to
look
at
the
nose
is
slightly
fruity
with
pilsner
malts
in
the
background
and
some
german
feeling
yeast
thats
both
doughy
and
dry
the
flavor
of
this
ale
is
very
light
with
some
strawlike
malts
and
just
a
dusting
of
hops
coming
through
mellow
fruit
although
it
flashes
too
quick
to
properly
identify
it
finish
is
mildly
bitter
a
little
contaminated
as
if
by
minerals
hard
water
or
something
i
dont
know
good
feel
though
drinkable
nice
and
easy
carbonation
is
much
better
than
it
appears
and
the
body
is
only
light
a
good
summer
quencher
but
not
a
beer
that
has
anything
new
to
offer
i
think
the
ipa
is
the
best
of
the
mission
beers
so
far
but
i
still
have
the
russian
imperial
in
the
fridge
so
there
is
some
hope
remaining
a
beer
my
molson
drinking
father
would
adore
for
me
just
another
day
at
the
office
i
have
a
couple
others
from
this
brewery
to
try
this
weekend
so
i
look
forward
to
those
after
this
good
experience
a
very
forgettable
ale
that
does
bring
both
flavors
of
a
blond
and
a
klosh
but
doesnt
really
make
you
want
to
come
back
for
more
ok
i
guess
overall
not
a
bad
tasting
brew
at
all
but
not
terribly
intriguing
to
think
about
highly
drinkable
and
tasty
if
mundane
ale
very
easily
sessionable
despite
being
just
at
the
high
end
strengthwise
for
that
very
thirstquenching
nothing
unique
but
nothing
to
complain
about
either
brilliant
golden
flowing
carbonation
bright
white
head
which
slowly
fades
away
and
leaves
speckled
lace
patterns
across
the
sides
of
my
glass
light
kiss
of
herbal
hops
mild
citrus
note
smooth
grainy
bread
filled
blonde
ale
on
the
nose
flavor
light
easy
going
beer
doesnt
challenge
the
senses
to
the
extreme
but
definitely
a
well
executed
warm
weather
beer
that
would
come
in
handy
in
the
summer
on
this
coast
and
yearly
on
the
left
coast
even
malt
balance
light
herbal
hops
biscuit
malt
clean
finish
simple
light
bodied
ale
with
ample
carbonation
smooth
clean
finish
minimal
booze
overall
impressive
simplicity
quite
enjoyable
theres
nothing
wrong
with
any
of
the
mission
beers
ive
come
across
doa
overall
not
bad
but
seems
like
its
missing
something
it
is
a
kolsch
but
more
like
an
ale
version
of
a
pilsner
lots
of
toasty
grainy
malts
straw
and
plenty
of
noble
hops
with
a
slight
metallic
twinge
and
a
light
and
slightly
crisp
but
more
ale
like
finish
i
think
it
would
have
been
better
with
a
lager
yeast
or
if
they
had
gone
more
kolsch
like
then
again
they
call
it
a
blonde
ale
and
more
kolschstyle
so
its
hard
to
really
judge
it
that
way
taste
is
similar
yeasty
apples
bread
dough
light
peppery
grassy
bitterness
under
the
light
sweetness
it
is
light
ans
simple
but
solid
and
wellrounded
and
holds
up
well
d
drinkable
yes
more
of
a
summer
brew
though
overall
a
damn
drinkable
blonde
id
definitely
drink
this
again
this
could
be
a
decent
quaff
except
for
the
peculiar
whiff
of
spoiled
fruit
flavor
mission
makes
some
good
brews
but
this
is
not
one
of
the
stars
nice
level
of
carbonation
slight
amber
to
the
gold
color
and
tight
healthy
head
o
not
something
that
i
would
consider
worth
having
again
only
got
less
tasteful
as
it
warmed
o
not
really
a
good
example
of
the
style
their
hefe
is
amazing
so
i
know
what
they
can
do
but
i
wasnt
a
fan
of
this
one
mouth
feel
medium
bodied

after

quenchable

through

ushers
in

before
transitioning
to
a

finishes
semidry
with

lightly
sweet

in
flavor

and
with
a
decently
lingering
finish
light
pils
flavor
carries
throughout
soft
and
light
yet
without
much
of
a
spice
footprint
poured
from
a
bomber
into
a
pint
glass
i
am
a
middlepouring
drinker
and
this
glass
completely
filled
with
all
foamy
white
head
in
an
instant
after
letting
it
settle
and
continuing
to
pour
the
beer
took
almost
5
minutes
to
pour
completely
i
would
say
that
denotes
a
solid
sign
of
overcarbonation
the
beer
is
an
extremely
light
and
pale
strawyellow
coloring
again
with
the
big
bubbled
white
chunky
head
that
finally
settles
into
a
manageable
one
inch
level
aromas
of
bright
sweet
lemon
zest
and
slightly
sour
tones
also
some
scents
of
toasted
oats
flavors
a
bit
muted
but
a
backbone
of
crisp
wet
hops
slips
in
and
hits
the
back
of
the
mouth
bits
of
smoke
and
toasted
malts
riding
the
hoppy
foundation
the
beer
is
very
wet
in
mouth
both
light
and
slick
minimal
sour
and
toasted
aftertaste
with
a
short
lived
finish
not
an
overwhelmingly
pleasant
beer
and
when
added
to
the
time
involved
just
to
pour
the
damn
thing
it
really
was
disappointing
drinkability
i
would
rate
this
fairly
high
on
the
drinkability
scale
it
is
not
my
preferred
style
but
i
think
it
is
a
beer
that
could
please
a
lot
of
people
if
i
were
one
to
limit
myself
to
a
single
option
at
a
gathering
this
beer
at
a
bbq
on
a
hot
summer
day
would
be
amazing
its
actually
dangerously
drinkable
which
is
a
quality
i
like
in
a
beer
because
i
think
its
important
to
get
those
you
love
sauced
up
at
social
gatherings
d
quite
drinkable
i
wish
there
was
a
little
more
going
on
here
though
drinkability
this
beer
was
nicely
quaffable
and
pleasantly
refreshing
d
a
solid
nonoffensive
kölsch
probably
better
local
tasty
enough
but
not
as
smooth
as
a
great
kolsch
should
be
the
grainyness
in
the
mouthfeel
detracts
and
the
bitterness
is
a
bit
heavy
for
the
style
also
not
screamingly
fresh
which
i
think
is
essential
in
a
lightweight
beer
of
this
nature
drinkable
enough
but
not
a
style
i
especially
enjoy
d
drinkability
was
average
and
fair
being
a
bit
sweet
upfront
with
not
much
hoppiness
to
counter
balance
which
may
limit
consumption
for
those
who
get
sugary
shock
rather
easily
some
acidity
is
detected
upon
the
swallow
overall
a
fair
rate
of
consumption
though
unlikely
repurchase
by
style
d
okay
but
a
little
too
cornygrainy
almost
like
a
macro
adjunct
beer
but
with
a
little
more
flavor
ive
had
a
few
different
versions
of
the
style
now
so
im
not
quite
as
new
to
it
missions
isnt
incredible
but
its
still
a
light
easydrinking
beer
with
a
pleasing
flavor
my
biggest
complaint
is
that
the
vinous
flavor
gets
overshadowed
by
noble
hop
bitterness
i
like
the
really
grapey
ones
best
and
while
the
aroma
is
nice
and
grapey
the
hops
overpower
the
vinous
note
once
you
take
a
sip
also
the
mouthfeel
seems
to
be
lacking
the
effervescence
of
more
traditional
versions
they
need
to
crank
up
the
carbonation
all
that
said
it
would
be
a
very
nice
session
beer
its
mildly
sweet
with
a
good
hop
bite
in
the
finish
and
quite
quaffable
nothing
extreme
it
wont
frighten
away
the
nonbeergeek
friends
that
come
over
but
with
enough
character
that
you
wouldnt
secretly
cringe
a
little
if
they
brought
a
bottle
over
with
them
for
you
an
all
right
beer
but
not
a
great
one
a
beer
really
made
more
for
your
average
budweiser
drinker
than
the
beer
connoisseur
drinkability
highly
drinkable
beer
that
paired
wonderfully
with
my
meal
grilled
mako
smoked
yukon
gold
mash
grilled
zucchini
all
drizzled
with
vanilla
oil
the
vanilla
oil
may
have
made
the
match
i
really
have
never
liked
blondes
before
but
this
is
an
amazing
beer
i
went
out
on
a
limb
because
i
know
mission
makes
some
great
lighter
styles
and
it
paid
off
poured
from
a
12
oz
can
into
a
pint
glass
this
creamy
ale
had
significant
head
a
strong
bready
smell
is
detectable
instantly
not
as
thinbodied
as
some
ales
this
beer
is
creamy
and
delicious
i
tend
to
like
my
beers
a
little
more
bitter
than
this
sweet
ale
but
its
a
great
drinkable
beer
o
mostly
a
creamed
corn
mush
but
that
lingering
bitterness
though
very
subtle
helps
smooth
out
the
big
sweetness
up
front
typical
of
the
style
its
got
a
lot
of
american
adjunct
lagerlike
taste
to
it
but
theres
nothing
wrong
with
it
at
all
a
beer
best
suited
for
the
hot
months
and
while
not
remarkable
in
any
way
i
might
call
for
one
from
time
to
time
out
and
about
nice
malthop
balance
pours
hazy
gold
with
small
white
head
smells
of
wheat
and
bready
malts
tastes
heavy
on
yeast
and
roasty
malts
thin
smooth
mouthfeel
this
beer
would

for

i
know
this
brew
particularly
has
helped
turn
many
of
my
friends
into
craft
beer
fans
this
is
light
crisp
and
unoffensive
o
this
beer
is
easy
to
drink
and
is
quite
flavorful
for
a
blonde
ale
making
it
a
good
representation
of
the
style
o
the
gateway
beer
into
the
southern
star
craft
brewery
its
nice
certainly
nothing
out
of
place
here
very
balanced
could
be
a
good
choice
for
the
beach
or
pool
this
is
a
good
brew
the
texture
is
nice
and
the
flavors
are
pleasant
i
am
increasingly
liking
canned
beer
blonde
ales
are
not
usually
something
i
drink
but
i
found
i
really
enjoyed
this
one
it
poured
a
golden
amber
with
a
big
frothy
white
head
and
plenty
of
fruity
malt
in
the
aroma
for
a
lighter
beer
it
had
a
nice
full
creamy
mouthfeel
with
hints
of
fruit
and
apricot
that
i
found
appealing
this
is
not
a
complex
in
your
face
beer
but
something
that
is
light
and
refreshing
with
enough
body
to
keep
it
interesting
a
great
beer
for
our
hot
texas
summer
days
o
it
was
served
ice
cold
will
try
it
again
on
a
hot
day
d
allinall
not
too
shabby
eliminate
the
haze
and
the
oxidation
and
you
have
a
solid
drinkable
blond
from
this
texas
brewery
o
no
reason
to
recommend
this
beer
good
taste
when
you
drink
it
but
the
aftertaste
is
not
to
my
preference
the
fact
that
it
comes
in
a
can
is
not
optimal
i
think
that
bottle
would
help
the
way
this
beer
is
drank
o
overall
i
feel
this
beer
is
great
for
someone
who
is
not
familiar
with
craft
beer
and
is
transitioning
from
adjunct
lagers
to
the
craft
world
i
feel
i
could
use
more

love
this
stuff
ive
had
it
served
on
draft
at
many
bars
and
they
routinely
dont
get
the
temperature
correct
and
it
just
doesnt
taste
right
to
me
drinks
eay
a
slightly
offcentered
blonde
imo
but
more
interesting
than
most
of
this
style
pours
hazy
gold
with
a
massive
fluffy
biege
head
the
head
dissipates
slowly
leaving
some
lacing
on
the
side
of
the
glass
the
head
retains
very
well
the
smell
is
pretty
mild
but
i
can
detect
some
breadiness
as
well
as
some
citrus
the
taste
is
bready
with
some
strong
citrus
flavor
there
is
some
bitterness
on
the
back
end
the
body
is
light
to
medium
the
beer
is
refreshing
and
easy
to
drink
overall
this
is
a
good
beer
this
would
be
great
for
drinking
on
a
hot
summer
day
pours
a
lightly
hazy
yellow
to
orangeish
color
with
a
white
head
in
the
aroma
a
small
dry
malt
and
a
note
of
dry
hops
in

taste
a
small

and
a
dry

a
smooth
and
medium

mouthfeel
with
a
small

in

aftertaste
a
bigger
hop
than
expected
but
just
ok
kind
of
average
3
5
d
fairly
tame
but
tasty
and
easy
to
drink
the
bombshell
blonde
ale
from
southern
start
is
ok
the
beer
pours
a
nice
clear
golden
color
with
bubbly
white
head
that
is
leaving
a
spotty
lace
the
smell
is
underwhelming
some
faint
lemonlemon
grass
zest
the
taste
is
very
sharp
starts
with
a
lemon
flare
then
turns
to
a
grainybread
finish
the
mouthfeel
is
light
to
medium
with
good
carbonation
overall
it
is
a
decent
beer
kind
of
thick
and
chewy
but
drinkable
i
would
continue
with
the
farmhouse
comparisons
man
im
getting
all
nostalgic
over
here
for
childhood
summers
playing
with
hay
bails
im
not
generally
a
big
fan
of
blondes
at
least
not
when
it
comes
to
beer
but
i
really
like
this
brew
id
love
it
on
a
lazy
summer
afternoon
the
fact
that
it
is
in
cans
also
makes
it
that
much
more
accessible
to
bring
campinghiking
or
to
the
beach
or
to
a
hayfield
somewhere
for
a
midsummer
picnic
grab
a
sixer
if
you
see
one
and
like
the
summer
months
well
crafted

immensely
enjoyable

could

a

these
in

very

comes

as
distinctively
balanced
overall
this
is
one
hell
of
a
refreshing
beer
and
southern
star
have
achieved
it
without
sacrificing
flavor
this
is
a
great
beer
to
drink
and
it
is
very
complex
there
is
no
other
blonde
ale
that
i
drink
the
way
i
drink
this
one
it
is
in
another
league
food
pairing
i
had
this
with
pizza
and
it
was
a
great
combination
a
large
4finger
white
bubbly
head
develops
with
good
retention
a
hazy
yellow
and
straw
colored
body
is
accentuated
by
an
endless
stream
of
bubbles
emanating
from
the
bottom
of
the
glass
the
aroma
is
of
wheat
straw
hops
lemon
orange
a
slight
funk
a
bit
of
spice
and
a
breadbiscuit
finish
it
tastes
of
bread
straw
lemon
orange
some
hops
and
a
bit
of
funky
yeast
mouthfeel
is
very
smooth
and
crisp
on
the
finish
overall
a
delicious
refreshing
brew
its
a
wellcrafted
golden
ale
a
light
beer
for
the
craft
set
i
like
this
beer
even
though
there
isnt
much
going
on
some
floral
hop
and
biscuit
notes
its
one
of
the
better
blondes
ive
had
do
drinkability
is
low
great
look
promising
smell
but
the
taste
and
mouthfeel
stick
the
nails
in
the
coffin
a
pleasure
to
admire
from
far
but
not
the
best
beer
to
actually
imbibe
overall
this
is
a
great
blonde
very
well
balanced
and
the
citrus
flavor
makes
it
a
great
summer
sipper
o
this
is
a
great
session
beer
and
a
perfect
beer
to
take
to
the
beach
or
fishing
keep
up
the
good
work
southern
star
overall
this
is
a
solid
offering
especially
since
it
comes
in
a
sometimes
more
friendly
can
format
as
long
as
i
dont
have
to
smell
it
much
it
still
doesnt
close
to
unseating
sun
king
for
my
go
to
lighter
ale
solid
beer
but
not
quite
what
i
was
expecting
for
a
blonde
is
a
bit
more
malty
than
i
was
expecting
this
beer
is
extremely
easy
to
down
leaves
a
very
nice
aftertaste
and
is
nice
and
smooth
good
job
southern
star
this
is
a
solid
summer
beer
i
would
have
liked
it
to
have
more
hops
to
balance
the
flavor
a
different
take
on
a
blonde
ale
that
works
very
well
this
is
my
second
offering
from
southern
star
and
so
far
i
am
diggin
their
brews
one
of
the
great
texas
craft
brews
that
i
should
have
discovered
a
while
ago
o
i
really
enjoy
beers
in
cans
and
im
glad
the
craft
beer
movement
is
heading
that
way
the
more
campingbeach
options
i
have
the
better
i
can
see
my
cooler
containing
this
next
time
i
head
for
an
outdoor
adventure
thanks
again
to
the
legendary
woodychandler
for
yet
another
canned
beer
poured
from
a
12
oz
can
this
beer
exploded
out
of
the
can
and
finally
setteled
down
to
have
a
cloudy
golden
color
with
about
2
inches
of
head
smell
is
malty
biscuts
slightly
sweet
taste
is
also
malty
and
biscuts
some
honey
a
bit
of
sweetness
to
it
feels
full
bodied
in
the
mouth
and
overall
is
a
quality
beer
o
great
beer
from
southern
star
since
it
comes
in
a
can
i
can
see
myself
quaffing
alot
of
these
by
the
pool
overallthis
is
kind
of
a
hybrid
between
a
hefeweizen
and
a
blonde
ale
love
the
fact
that
its
canned
and
a
7
99
six
pack
is
great
for
a
summer
beer
yet
another
quality
beer
from
southern
star
pours
golden
with
a
12
inch
pillow
of
white
head
that
fades
rather
quickly
to
a
thin
layer
smell
is
of
sweet
maltiness
and
a
hint
of
hops
but
just
a
hint
the
taste
is
just
like
the
smell
sweet
and
citrusy
and
balanced
extremely
well
the
carbonation
is
perfect
giving
this
beer
a
creamy
texture
truly
a
great
session
beer
o
as
drinkable
as
it
gets
balanced
taste
pleasing
mouth
feel
moderate
abv
a
damn
good
session
beer
worthy
of
multiple
purchases
o
great
beer
wish
i
had
a
yard
to
mow
and
a
full
case
of
these
to
drink
just
what
was
needed
after
finishing
work
i
love
blond
beer
and
that
makes
that
i
am
giving
this
good
brew
a
high
rating
a
very
soft
and
tasty
beer
d
definitely
a
session
beer
this
one
is
perfect
for
hot
summer
days
not
too
heavy
for
a
day
at
the
lake
and
flavorful
enough
to
still
be
good
at
a
party
that
night
overall
usually
not
a
big
fan
of
the
blonde
ales
but
this
one
knocked
my
socks
off
big
fan
of
this
brew
overall
seems
more
like
a
light
pale
ale
than
a
blonde
but
on
a
warm
night
this
would
go
down
easily
again
and
again
edit
after
having
another
can
i
believe
this
may
be
better
classified
as
a
kolsch
big
lemony
esters
in
any
case
very
refreshing
nice
summertime
quencher
pours
a
pale
hazy
orange
with
a
bit
of
white
head
smells
floral
and
a
but
hoppy
tastes
smooth
and
sweet
with
a
nice
kick
of
malts
on
the
backbone
vry
drinkable
and
pretty
tasty
all
things
considered
not
something
i
would
seek
out
but
above
average
i
didnt
know
what
to
expect
from
a
texas
blonde
ale
but
this
one
pours
a
slightly
hazed
honey
golden
hue
with
a
bright
white
head
aroma
is
pretty
mellow
layers
of
grassy
herbal
hops
and
sweet
honey
drizzled
bread
notes
flavors
more
grassy
herbal
hops
lending
a
slight
bitterness
with
a
nice
honey
dipped
breadiness
full
all
grain
malts
going
on
no
rough
offness
just
a
clean
drinkable
golden
ale
satisfying
maltiness
and
even
carbonation
with
a
light
to
medium
body
straight
from
the
can
into
my
favorite
mug
overall
experience
so
far
with
these
texan
canned
beers
have
been
nothing
but
positive
if
you
see
them
grab
some
especially
fresh
pale
ale
or
any
form
of
the
buried
hatchet
stout
this
blonde
does
it
all
without
doing
too
much
or
trying
to
hard
very
refreshing
and
has
a
lot
of
depth
to
it
i
cant
wait
to
put
a
six
pack
in
my
cooler
and
go
play
a
round
of
golf
or
go
to
the
lake
its
a
home
run
of
a
blonde
for
sure
pours
hazy
yellow
with
a
full
white
head
smells
like
a
slightly
soured
belgian
ale
taste
is
like
lemonrind
and
tea
brewed
bready
malts
just
a
hint
of
that
soured
nose
really
odd
mouthfeel
is
big
carbonation
and
a
medium
body
overall
this
beer
is
alright
something
seems
off
not
the
quintessential
blondie
but
damn
drinkable
the
carbonation
level
seems
alright
along
with
the
beers
medium
body
the
mouthfeel
is
bombshell
blondes
most
appealing
characteristic
ultimately
though
i
find
this
to
be
a
boring
bland
example
of
the
blonde
ale
style
when
people
say
that
they
dont
usually
like
blonde
ales
its
because
of
snoozefests
like
this
offering
o
all
in
all
this
is
a
solid
brew
not
much
going
on
in
the
scent
but
a
very
easy
and
natural
taste
great
to
try
if
you
like
session
brews
and
have
access
wellbalanced
hop
and
malt
flavor
is
very
drinkable
one
of
the
best
blonde
ales
ive
had
in
quite
a
while
d
pretty
good
brew
very
easy
to
drink
a
few
of
these
during
a
sitting
nice
spring
summer
time
brew
i
would
have
this
brew
again
and
would
recommend
it
d
i
really
enjoyed
this
beer
alot
very
drinkable
and
very
cheap
will
be
picking
this
up
to
throw
in
my
disc
golf
bag
to
drink
on
the
course
give
this
one
a
try
if
you
havent
i
can
only
say
good
things
about
this
beer
as
it
has
served
me
so
well
after
many
tastings
i
have
had
many
cans
of
this
delightful
brew
from
southern
star
brewing
out
of
conroe
tx
pours
a
hazy
yelloworange
smells
deliciously
sweet
and
drinks
the
same
drinkability
is
extremely
high
as
i
could
have
one
of
these
daily
light
on
the
hops
and
malts
are
balanced
very
well
with
the
sweetness
of
this
brew
truly
a
delight
i
just
gave
it
a
3
0
in
appearance
given
that
i
had
it
out
of
a
can
i
dont
really
know
what
separates
a
beer
from
having
an
awful
appearance
versus
an
exceptional
appearance
you
know
unless
there
were
little
bits
of
meat
floating
around
in
it
or
something
i
suppose
that
would
be
pretty
awful
mouthfeeldrinkability
light
bodied
but
the
carbonation
is
really
nice
pretty
smooth
going
down
this
is
a
really
welldone
blonde
ale
and
very
drinkable
it
has
just
enough
flavor
to
make
it
sessionable
and
give
you
a
desire
to
have
several
i
enjoyed
this
beer
more
than
expected
not
ususally
a
lighter
beer
person
but
this
one
worked
for
me
very
light
and
refreshing
great
summer
beer
its
like
a
german
hefeweizen
mixed
with
a
light
pale
ale
a
good
beer
here
definitely
worth
a
tick
or
a
trade
hattip
to
crusian
for
the
cans
picked
up
a
can
at
whole
foods
clean
but
a
bit
boring
just
very
subtle
pale
malt
and
a
hint
of
herbal
hops
this
is
a
very
light
tasting
ale
though
the
body
isnt
too
thin
its
a
fine
lawnmower
beer
probably
a
good
beer
for
a
party
with
mixed
beer
appreciation
but
i
wouldnt
buy
it
for
myself
d
it
is
a
good
beer
for
a
hot
day
there
is
little
complexity
i
really
liked
the
small
amount
of
hop
spice
i
just
really
wish
there
was
a
lot
more
partly
refreshing
but
then
much
too
sweet
with
a
constant
butterscotch
note
not
diacetyl
though
which
grows
very
tiresome
although
my
girlfriend
enjoyed
it
much
more
than
me
so
ymmv
impression
a
mostly
forgettable
beer
that
i
would
not
recommend
unless
offered
as
a
freebie
this
is
a
solid
blonde
the
best
part
about
it
is
the
smell
i
found
it
more
flavorful
than
most
blondes
as
well
its
too
bad
the
beer
didnt
match
up
to
the
buxom
blonde
on
the
can
the
best
things
about
this
beer
were
the
appearance
it
didnt
look
like
an
adjunct
lager
and
the
mouthfeel
which
was
thicker
than
i
expected
but
lets
be
honest
who
buys
a
beer
for
these
two
charactistics
alone
the
taste
factor
dropped
off
for
me
because
it
had
a
strange
lingering
aftertaste
that
i
couldnt
put
my
finger
on
not
repulsive
just
weird
it
didnt
make
me
anticipate
the
next
sip
though
if
you
have
no
hair
on
your
chest
and
this
is
a
favorite
style
of
yours
then
give
it
a
try
however
this
brewery
has
much
better
offerings
like
the
pale
ale
and
proam
not
something
i
would
seek
again
unless
they
attempted
an
imperial
version
d
well
this
is
very
drinkable
tastes
pretty
good
pleasant
and
not
heavy
d
very
much
so
my
full
review
is
here
httpwhatareyoudrinking
net201101thistinwomanhasheartbombshellblondeale
i
would
definitely
buy
this
again
this
was
good
and
had
just
about
everything
i
like
in
an
american
blonde
ale
a
moderately
assertive
bitterness
fruity
hop
flavors
a
silky
sweet
malt
backing
and
a
refreshing
and
crisp
drinkibility
i
pulled
this
cold
out
of
the
box
and
immediately
poured
it
and
had
it
with
dinner
this
is
the
type
of
beer
i
love
to
see
being
put
in
cans
for
all
its
carbonation
this
beer
is
a
very
smooth
drink
mediumbodied
and
almost
creamy
it
was
not
what
i
expected
from
its
appearance
drinkability
is
good
but
i
would
find
it
moreso
if
it
was
just
a
bit
lighter
pours
a
nice
blonde
color
duh
with
a
small
head
that
leaves
some
good
lace
the
aroma
is
lots
of
melon
fruitiness
and
a
nice
breadiness
with
some
yeasty
notes
the
flavor
is
honey
with
some
white
grape
and
baguette
plenty
of
fruity
citrus
notes
and
some
mild
hoppiness
just
delicious
wow
this
beer
really
surprised
meim
not
really
big
on
blonde
alesexcept
belgian
blondesthe
smell
straight
out
of
the
can
reminded
me
of
a
nati
lighti
wasnt
really
expecting
muchbut
that
first
taste
was
awesomei
really
like
ityou
can
def
taste
the
sweet
maltsthe
hop
presence
is
not
there
as
expecteddef
drinkabledef
worth
checking
outa
texan
beer
that
is
actually
pretty
decent
d
im
not
usually
one
for
blonde
ales
but
this
was
quite
nice
easy
to
drink
and
fairly
complex
this
is
not
a
bad
tasting
beer
by
any
means
its
just
on
the
unimpressive
side
even
still
its
light
smooth
and
refreshing
and
for
someone
looking
for
a
beer
they
can
suck
down
a
few
of
on
a
lazy
afternoon
this
is
honestly
a
solid
choice
d
good
beer
with
a
few
flaws
that
limit
my
score
and
desire
for
more
a
little
unclear
when
this
beer
was
birthed
so
its
debatable
where
this
can
is
in
terms
of
its
freshness
case
in
point
friend
returned
with
it
from
texas
midsummer
but
its
been
fridgebound
ever
since
my
hunch
is
though
that
its
still
pretty
fresh
its
just
among
the
middle
of
the
pack
for
those
ive
tried
of
the
style
i
could
return
to
this
or
not
though
since
this
is
my
second
of
two
cans
i
guess
i
did
return
to
it
thanks
bill
slight
carbonation
with
no
alcohol
flavors
present
all
around
a
very
sessionable
beer
would
pair
very
well
with
a
light
lunch
no
strong
flavors
to
overpower
any
food
offerings
southern
star
bombshell
blonde
should
be
renamed
pop
gun
blonde
even
that
though
implies
more
power
and
personality
than
this
rail
thin
brew
delivers
each
and
every
one
of
you
no
matter
where
you
live
should
be
able
to
find
better
beer
than
this
d
very
drinkable
could
easily
session
on
a
hot
day
outside
but
hey
the
label
is
way
cool
i
have
4
left
and
will
pawn
them
off
on
neighbors
to
see
if
somethings
amiss
mouthfeel
and
drinkability
are
both
topnotch
smooth
silken
texture
that
sticks
around
just
long
enough
to
show
off
a
pleasantly
sweet
aftertaste
this
is
an
american
golden
ale
sure
a
blonde
ale
but
it
leans
towards
a
lesser
hoppy
pale
ale
cream
ale
and
wit
unique
and
definitely
worth
trying
and
revisiting
rjt
beer
is
medium
to
light
in
body
and
has
a
nice
bitterness
to
ti
there
is
an
aftertaste
that
is
slightly
grainy
overall
its
moderately
carbonated
and
has
some
sweetness
up
front
its
kind
of
corny
at
the
back
overall
its
ok
drinkability
very
drinkable
had
my
first
tending
the
grill
on
a
texas
august
i
e
quite
warm
day
this
definitely
could
be
a
session
beer
these
are
just
over
5
for
a
6er
at
my
local
specs
my
uncle
who
swears
by
coors
light
drank
a
can
and
said
it
was
good
that
says
something
for
a
man
whos
never
had
anything
other
than
coors
his
whole
life
a
pleasant
surprise
of
a
brew
with
a
nice
bellowing
head
of
ivory
and
a
body
of
cloudy
gold
this
beer
has
sediment
and
you
can
drink
it
clear
or
cloudy
there
is
a
lot
of
esters
in
the
cloudiness
but
the
yeastiness
does
get
a
bit
overboard
smell
of
zucchini
bread
and
very
delicate
pineapple
fruit
palate
is
not
as
exciting
fruit
is
subdued
by
yeastiness
and
the
bitter
is
finish
has
a
straw
must
to
it
not
bad
the
infiltered
aspect
is
a
saving
grace
for
the
ester
and
gentle
body
a
bit
too
gentle
at
times
light
body
with
plenty
of
carbonation
not
the
most
amazing
beer
ever
but
this
is
a
solid
canned
craft
option
probably
will
not
have
this
one
again
thou
d
this
is
a
very
easy
drinking
beer
that
is
refreshing
if
there
were
more
balance
in
taste
i
think
it
would
definitely
add
to
its
drinkability
this
beer
is
way
too
dark
to
be
a
blonde
more
of
a
light
amber
toasty
sweet
hazelnut
and
honey
in
the
nose
similar
taste
very
much
like
a
bizzare
amber
the
dry
toasty
hazelnut
finish
lingers
long
after
you
swallow
very
unexpected
flavors
in
this
beer
pretty
nice
this
is
one
of
the
better
blondes
ive
had
its
full
flavored
but
it
doesnt
end
up
syrupy
nothing
stands
out
as
particularly
good
or
memorable
its
just
ok
after
this
6
pack
im
done
with
this
one
the
sweet
and
grainy
malt
is
foremost
in
the
flavor
here
a
slight
hop
bitterness
but
mostly
a
gentle
noblehop
like
spiciness
quite
pleasant
overallthe
flavors
are
subdued
and
understated
but
they
work
together
quite
well
mediumlight
bodied
with
a
prickly
and
grainy
mouthfeel
drinkability
is
excellent
and
i
think
quite
well
suited
for
a
hot
summer
day
d
great
session
beer
d
the
taste
is
good
and
the
beer
is
light
and
refreshing
with
low
carbonation
makes
this
beer
good
and
drinkable
overall
very
tasty
a
little
odd
for
the
style
but
i
like
that
it
has
character
meh
im
not
in
love
with
this
one
its
decent
but
odd
im
not
sure
what
kind
of
occasion
id
want
to
drink
this
on
its
not
crisp
or
refreshing
enough
its
not
refreshing
at
all
to
be
a
go
to
summer
beer
in
my
opinion
and
thats
the
one
place
i
could
see
it
fitting
it
doesnt
though
a
puzzling
little
beer
i
dont
think
id
come
back
to
it
d
it
does
give
some
semblance
of
drinkability
if
a
straight
forward
malt
heavy
nonbalanced
beer
is
your
style
for
me
i
tried
it
if
i
were
offered
it
again
i
would
respectfully
decline
it
a
nice
enough
beer
for
uncritical
drinking
on
a
warm
day
cant
think
of
too
many
other
situations
where
i
would
be
interested
in
drinking
a
beer
like
this
drinkability
if
you
are
looking
for
an
inyourface
over
the
top
beer
this
isnt
it
if
you
are
looking
for
a
simple
very
drinkable
brew
to
enjoy
and
relax
with
here
it
is
this
is
the
kind
of
beer
you
can
just
sit
down
and
drink
without
having
to
think
about
or
analyze
enjoy
it
for
what
it
is
i
sure
am
pours
a
cloudy
pale
golden
color
with
a
huge
rocky
white
head
aromas
of
bready
malt
light
caramel
and
a
hint
of
hops
on
the
palate
a
nice
mix
of
sweet
malt
and
hops
make
this
one
quite
drinkable
nicely
carbonation
leads
to
a
clean
mouthfeel
which
creates
a
good
refreshing
beer
nothing
out
of
the
ordinary
just
a
good
simple
canned
beer
theres
plenty
of
drinkability
to
this
one
though
if
it
was
stronger
id
be
more
inclined
to
it
all
round
a
tasty
brew
though
overall
not
too
bad
coming
from
a
can
certainly
drinkable
and
creamy
if
a
bit
unbalanced
in
the
finish
d
i
could
kill
a
case
of
cans
on
the
river
d
well
balanced
nicely
blended
decent
representation
of
style
goes
down
very
easy
and
definitely
one
to
sit
with
for
a
while
poured
into
an
imperial
pint
formed
a
1
14
beige
head
above
the
cloudy
amber
brew
dense
bubbly
head
recedes
slowly
with
prevalent
chunky
lacing
aroma
is
sweet
with
a
fruity
bubblegum
tinge
to
it
taste
mirrors
the
nose
mostly
but
near
the
close
hits
an
earthy
hoppiness
that
i
could
have
done
without
mouthfeel
is
smooth
but
kind
of
thin
and
drinkability
is
okay
as
well
d
this
would
make
a
nice
summer
session
beer
for
sure
lots
of
flavor
for
what
it
is
and
it
goes
down
easy
taste
might
suffer
a
bit
but
there
are
times
when
this
would
really
hit
the
spot
another
beer
i
wish
we
had
here
in
mn
dnotes
this
is
actually
a
good
brew
but
odd
as
it
may
sound
may
just
be
a
bit
too
rich
and
flavorful
for
what
somebody
expects
for
the
style
it
really
doesnt
taste
much
like
a
blonde
ale
as
in
a
blind
taste
test
i
would
say
one
could
easily
take
it
for
a
light
vienna
lager
or
amber
ale
that
being
said
with
a
semicomplex
flavor
moderate
abv
and
the
fact
that
its
canned
this
is
a
great
anytime
anywhere
session
beer
for
a
beer
geek
i
cracked
this
beer
after
an
indoor
soccer
game
cause
i
wanted
something
mild
this
would
make
a
nice
summer
session
beer
i
would
probably
pick
up
some
of
this
if
it
were
available
to
me
because
it
would
be
acceptable
to
my
noncraft
beer
drinking
friends
glad
i
got
to
try
it
glad
i
had
the
opportunity
to
try
this
the
refreshing
light
body
and
low
abv
make
this
a
good
quaffer
for
the
spring
or
summer
it
is
not
very
complex
and
the
aforementioned
strange
bitter
flavor
keeps
this
one
from
a
higher
rating
still
well
worth
trying
dark
honey
blonde
with
a
massive
rocky
merengue
like
head
of
cream
colored
foam
that
lasts
for
days
honeysuckle
pale
malt
and
a
touch
of
floral
hops
in
the
nose
plenty
of
pale
and
vienna
malt
flavors
with
a
touch
of
honey
and
decent
hop
bittering
in
the
finish
creamy
bodied
with
mild
carbonation
a
nice
beer
but
not
one
i
would
go
out
of
my
way
for
d
while
it
does
have
some
nice
flavor
going
on
the
mouthfeel
is
pretty
much
enough
to
say
goodnight
for
me
id
drink
this
before
a
budweiser
but
not
much
else
the
blond
on
the
can
convinced
me
to
drink
this
after
having
sat
in
my
fridge
for
a
week
or
two
there
is
a
wonderful
dense
head
on
this
beer
as
it
clings
to
the
glass
on
the
way
down
as
the
can
states
clarity
is
overrated
a
hazy
dull
yellow
colored
beer
the
nose
is
primarily
yeast
character
with
just
a
bit
of
malty
aroma
orange
slice
smell
as
well
more
bitter
than
i
expected
for
a
blond
but
balanced
in
its
sweetness
the
floral
hops
blend
well
too
creamy
mouth
that
ends
semidry
altogether
it
makes
for
a
very
drinkable
delicious
blond
ale
quite
a
drinkable
beer
actually
i
liked
it
and
i
am
not
traditionally
a
big
fan
of
the
blonde
category
of
beer
where
this
beer
actually
shines
is
in
its
mildness
lager
smooth
and
completely
inoffensive
with
a
big
grain
flavor
very
easy
on
the
taste
buds
the
mouthfeel
is
on
the
lighter
side
with
moderate
carbonation
drinkability
is
pretty
good
the
vienna
malt
added
a
nice
flavor
to
it
that
i
enjoyed
its
definitely
different
then
any
other
american
blonde
that
i
have
had
before
but
it
was
pretty
good
i
was
very
pleased
with
this
beer
it
had
a
nice
amount
of
flavor
and
would
make
a
great
session
beer
light
to
medium
body
with
decent
carbonation
light
and
refreshing
fairly
easy
to
drink
but
maybe
a
little
bland
i
would
probably
get
bored
of
this
after
a
couple
dpretty
easy
drinking
as
most
bloneds
tend
to
be
this
one
has
very
full
flavor
though
which
ive
really
not
experienced
with
this
style
before
lots
of
foam
and
lacing
after
he
pour
from
this
headdy
brew
a
wheat
beer
like
haze
of
amber
copper
and
sediment
very
attractive
looking
beer
toasted
bready
malts
some
pilsner
malts
give
a
grainy
smell
and
taste
to
this
brew
while
the
yeast
seems
to
impart
an
aroma
ofdried
apricots
and
light
berries
the
yeast
seems
to
vamp
up
the
berry
flavors
when
you
take
a
sip
of
seems
to
be
exacerbated
but
in
a
good
way
the
palate
is
a
little
powdery
but
definetly
grainy
and
full
of
character
this
has
turned
out
to
be
my
favorite
blonde
ive
had
so
far
i
recommend
anyone
trying
this
beer
d
this
is
a
very
drinkable
beer
i
was
surprised
with
this
one
i
am
starting
to
remember
that
just
because
it
comes
in
a
can
doesnt
mean
it
will
be
bad
would
recommend
to
anyone
who
wants
to
either
try
the
style
or
come
back
to
a
good
beer
in
the
style
pours
a
cloudy
pale
golden
color
with
a
monstrous
creamy
white
head
that
shows
much
resilience
fruity
bready
aromas
waft
in
front
of
my
nose
with
some
bitter
citrus
as
a
supporting
player
taste
is
creamy
rich
and
malty
with
lots
of
fruit
citrus
and
honey
rich
creamy
velvety
mouthfeel
medium
level
of
carbonation
light
to
medium
body
i
am
very
impressed
with
this
one
very
light
and
flavorful
i
could
see
downing
many
of
these
if
i
still
lived
in
houston
very
drinkable
very
smooth
i
will
have
to
drink
more
blondes
because
i
just
might
like
this
style
golden
colored
quite
cloudy
and
hazy
making
slightly
opaque
head
is
thick
and
frothy
and
sticks
down
the
sides
smell
is
a
bit
fruity
mostly
pear
and
apple
little
hop
aroma
taste
follows
the
smell
with
hints
of
pear
hints
of
a
bready
finish
definately
a
nice
malt
background
on
it
a
slight
bitterness
closes
out
the
finish
drinkability
is
incredibly
high
on
this
one
pours
a
golden
orange
with
a
nice
onefinger
white
head
the
beer
is
slightly
hazy
the
aroma
is
wheat
lemon
malt
and
some
honey
the
flavor
is
very
nice
with
some
citrus
and
honey
and
biscuit
malt
i
also
get
a
little
caramel
characteristic
in
the
flavor
the
mouthfeel
is
medium
and
very
creamy
medium
carbonation
a
great
blonde
ale
and
it
is
nice
to
see
a
brewery
actually
try
and
pack
flavor
into
a
beer
of
this
style
instead
of
just
brewing
a
watereddown
beer
calling
it
a
blonde
ale
and
targeting
bmc
drinkers
the
beer
is
well
carbonated
has
a
light
sharp
mouthfeel
and
crisp
finish
it
takes
all
the
desirable
traits
of
an
american
macro
light
easy
to
drink
crisp
mouthfeel
and
adds
a
bit
of
body
depth
and
a
very
nice
balanced
flavor
this
is
something
i
would
definitely
like
to
see
in
new
england
especially
during
the
summer
months
would
i
buy
more
of
it
sure
if
i
lived
down
in
texas
i
could
see
myself
drinking
a
few
of
these
from
time

opinion
i
might
be
jaded
as
this
brewery
is
just
minutes
from
my
house
so
i
am
getting
the
beer
as
fresh
as
it
can
be
this
is
a
session
beer
and
i
think
that
it
is
a
very
good
example
of
the
style
i
like
the
complexity
to
the
malt
on
the
palate
and
the
fact
that
the
hops
are
noticeable
but
play
a
supporting
role
in
the
finish
all
this
combines
into
what
i
would
call
one
of
the
best
examples
of
this
style
i
would
definitely
recommend
it
dsouthern
star
does
it
again
a
very
nicely
done
sessionable
american
blonde
plenty
of
flavour
light
and
easy
to
drink
this
one
would
stand
up
nicely
at
a
texas
bbq
on
a
hot
dry
summer
day
deep
in
the
heart
of
i
liked
this
beer
refreshing
not
much
of
an
aftertaste
citrusy
and
clean
can
is
retro
and
all
so
way
to
go
with
that
if
you
like
that
stuff
pick
some
up
d
is
out
of
sight
could
drink
this
all
day
and
not
get
bored
which
is
rare
for
most
texas
blondes
pours
a
hazy
straw
color
with
a
very
ambitious
head
that
leaves
a
nice
lacing
behind
aroma
is
slightly
sweet
corn
honey
and
wheat
notes
taste
is
predominantly
sweet
the
result
of
bread
wheat
and
corn
flavors
no
bitterness
whatsoever
in
this
beer
features
an
extremely
short
finish
with
no
aftertaste
at
all
pours
a
pleasant
apricot
color
with
a
thick
white
head
that
leaves
some
lacing
there
are
lots
of
little
floaters
suspended
in
it
and
there
are
striations
of
color
toward
the
top
with
a
distinct
pale
cloudy
band
just
below
the
head
its
not
a
pristine
appearance
but
a
very
interesting
one
the
smell
is
mild
but
pleasant
with
notes
of
stone
fruit
biscuit
tangy
yeast
and
minerals
the
taste
is
again
nothing
too
assertive
but
is
quite
delicious
apricot
wheat
bread
chewy
yeast
some
faint
piny
notes
in
the
finish
its
a
little
like
some
belgian
pale
ales
reminds
me
a
little
of
taras
boulba
its
highly
carbonated
which
is
perfect
for
its
rather
thick
body
its
too
complex
and
meaty
for
a
lawnmower
beer
but
i
could
see
putting
away
a
good
few
of
these
in
a
sitting
glad
i
found
this
on
my
visit
to
victoria
tx
too
bad
its
not
in
every
store
in
town
d
i
could
definitely
keep
drinking
this
its
kind
of
like
a
bmc
on
steroids
ya
know
with
actual
flavor
good
brew
d
tasty
goes
down
very
easily
not
too
filling
mild
kick
good
representation
of
style
this
is
a
good
mild
beer
with
a
lot
of
flavor
and
substance
to
make
it
one
that
you
can
pound
down
several
of
throughout
an
evening
i
love
this
beer
and
its
one
that
beeradvocate
has
the
right
idea
about
many
times
i
think
that
the
ba
reviewers
are
blind
to
the
charms
of
beers
with
a
milder
flavor
but
apparently
this
one
bridges
the
gap
positively
delightful
and
an
incredible
bargain
to
boot
d
pretty
easy
to
drink
could
see
this
being
a
great
summer
time
session
brew
im
not
normally
a
fan
of
the
style
but
this
is
alot
more
like
a
hefe
than
any
blonde
ive
had
upon
cracking
open
the
can
head
began
to
foam
up
as
though
it
could
not
wait
to
escape
pretty
dang
full
can
as
it
turns
out
my
aggressive
pour
resulted
in
a
foamy
soapy
two
fingers
of
ecru
head
with
good
retention
the
color
was
a
really
cloudy
extrahazy
honeygolden
shade
nose
was
an
interesting
mix
of
grassy
hops
and
biscuitybready
malt
mouthfeel
was
somewhat
full
almost
creamy
with
that
same
grassybready
admixture
of
flavors
on
the
tongue
that
i
noted
on
the
nose
wild
the
finish
gave
way
to
the
breadybiscuity
flavor
which
was
just
fine
man
i
really
liked
this
beer
and
could
definitely
see
it
filling
my
cooler
in
the
summer
the
beer
is
a
bit
bigger
than
the
crisper
versions
of
blondes
that
appeal
to
me
the
extra
sweetness
and
fruitiness
proves
to
much
in
the
end
thanks
exiled
drinkability
not
a
beer
i
would
have
sought
out
had
i
not
heard
the
review
on
craft
beer
radio
not
sure
this
qualifies
as
a
blonde
ale
i
think
it
is
a
very
creative
take
to
define
a
new
style
d
picnic
beach
yard
work
funerals
this
beer
is
great
anywhere
and
should
be
consumed
by
the
sixer
feel
free
to
channel
your
innerjohn
belushi
decent
enough
beer
once
you
get
beyond
her
looks
theres
not
much
to
her
goes
down
real
easy
d
i
like
it
an
easy
drinker
doesnt
make
you
think
a
def
summer
beer
mouthfeel
drinkability
the
beer
has
a
light
body
it
never
dips
into
the
thin
bodied
notes
the
carbonation
is
active
and
totally
appropriate
to
this
beer
this
is
a
beer
that
i
could
session
with
and
never
be
bored
well
played
dark
cloudy
burnished
gold
the
head
is
creamy
white
and
leaves
very
nice
lacing
smells
of
hops
strawberries
and
a
subtle
pine
note
so
far
way
up
there
on
the
canned
beer
scale
taste
is
freakin
awesome
nice
nice
balance
of
malt
and
hops
again
delicate
hops
and
a
faint
strawberry
taste
a
sharp
finish
not
too
assertive
very
very
very
very
nice
mouthfeel
is
soft
and
a
touch
undercarbonated
drinkability
is
very
good
an
afternoon
in
the
making
for
sure
md
this
beer
is
a
huge
surprise
i
was
expecting
something
like
firemans
4
which
is
a
simple
drinkable
ale
but
this
beer
is
way
more
complex
tasting
the
mouthfeel
is
the
very
definition
of
creamy
and
begs
for
more
sips
a
fake
blonde
but
still
a
lot
of
fun
pretty
good
overall
and
easily
a
session
beer
the
low
abv
and
abundance
of
flavor
make
this
a
cool
session
brew
glad
i
got
to
try
it
not
usually
a
fan
of
blonde
ales
but
id
say
this
is
one
of
the
better
ones
ive
had
not
bad
the
beer
has
an
interesting
honey
malt
sweetness
and
a
good
hop
flavor
and
aroma
however
there
is
a
bit
of
fusel
alcohol
in
this
one
which
is
sort
of
a
turn
off
in
a
beer
this
light
cloudy
darker
than
a
blond
but
lighter
than
an
amber
it
appears
golden
with
a
tinge
of
red
it
produces
a
very
small
head
but
its
dense
enough
to
produce
a
nice
lace
theres
no
noticeable
carbonation
i
get
faint
hints
of
cherry
in
the
aroma
nice
balance
between
the
malt
hops
and
alcohol
a
thicker
mouthfeel
than
you
would
expect
a
bit
on
the
chewy
side
finish
is
also
well
balanced
with
both
sweet
and
bitter
notes
overall
i
would
definitely
go
here
again
this
was
a
superb
offering
for
a
hot
summer
day
highly
recommend
nicely
carbonated
and
creamy
very
smooth
and
easy
to
drink
a
nice
beer
for
a
hot
day
and
you
can
easily
put
down
many
of
these
this
is
an
incredibly
drinkable
blonde
ale
its
perfect
on
a
hot
day
another
craft
brew
in
a
can
always
a
welcome
sight
this
is
a
nice
session

by

taste

chewy
also
unique
in
a
blond

leaves
my

a

sticky

other
blonds
ive
had

very
low

goes
this
is
a
drinkable
example
solidly
made
and
easy
to

d
definitely
a
session
beer
this
one
is
perfect
for
hot
summer
days
not
too
heavy
for
a
day
at
the
lake
and
flavorful
enough
to
still
be
good
at
a
party
that
night
tastes
exactly
like
it
smells
like
a
cross
between
a
vienna
and
an
american
blonde
with
a
big
biscuity
yeast
finish
hops
pervade
all
throughout
and
all
around
its
a
damn
good
balance
between
sweet
grain
and
bitter
hops
a
fine
brew
here
in
this
blonde
ale
wellcrafted
and
unique
easily
drinkable
at
5
abv
i
will
happily
return
to
this
blond
bombshell
d
yep
keep
them
coming
i
can
see
this
being
a
staple

a

with
a
substantial
offwhite
head
that
lasts
and
leaves
nice

smells
of
sweet
light
honeyed

and
a

the
taste

a
nice
bready
quality
light

refreshing
medium

with
lowish
carbonation
nice
blonde
overall
only
the
words
thoroughly
enjoyable
could
summarize
this
beer
nothing
too
much
to
criticize
notes
i
wasnt
impressed
with
the
appearance
and
smell
but
the
taste
changed
my
mind
thats
whats
most
important
anyway
i
guess
a
great
beer
for
converting
the
bmc
heathens
or
for
when
youre
just
thirsty
drinkability
not
my
favorite
style
but
ill
be
damned
if
i
couldnt
drink
a
lot
of
this
on
a
hot
day
or
even
right
now
sitting
in
a
68
degree
house
it
doesnt
taste
or
smell
as
good
as
a
kickass
ipa
or
ris
but
that
shouldnt
be
what
its
held
up
against
its
a
blonde
ale
and
i
cant
think
of
another
beer
of
the
same
style
that
id
rather
have
great
job
southern
star
overall
this
is
a
great
offering
from
texas
anyone
who
enjoys
blondes
should
like
this
i
know
it
is
slowly
being
distributed
to
other
states
if
you
can
not
get
this
drop
me
a
line
maybe
we
can
trade
d
very
drinkable
i
will
be
seeking
this
beer
out
again
overall
a
good
beer
that
i
mildly
recommend
if
you
can
easily
find
it
especially
if
in
a
buddys
fridge
for
me
it
doesnt
have
enough
flavor
to
warrant
buying
many
unless
on
tap
and
limited
choices
or
a
friend
has
it
poured
into
a
pint
glass
pale
straw
yellow
with
a
nice
thick
white
head
lacing
all
the
way
down
the
glass
smell
is
very
fruity
suprisingly
strong
taste
is
very
malty
with
hints
of
various
fruit
flavors
the
hop
bite
at
the
end
leaves
a
slight
dry
feel
which
is
the
only
downer
this
is
going
to
be
a
great
texas
summer
beer
verdict
perfect
for
sessioning
bombshell
is
just
a
mild
and
friendly
beer
every
brewery
has
to
have
an
offering
or
two
in
their
lineup
that
appeals
to
the
fans
of
lighter
beers
luckily
this
one
has
soul
and
flavors
in
abundance
a
perfect
companion
for
a
hot
summer
day
here
in
texas
this
blonde
might
not
be
a
bombshell
but
id
definitely
penetrate
her
aluminum
lining
and
session
her
with
rock
hard
resolve
a
very
solid
beer
taste
is
very
unique
and
tasty
it
has
plenty
of
husky
grainy
maltiness
and
a
noticeable
hop
presence
sweet
toffee
and
caramel
flavors
are
followed
up
by
a
mild
bitter
finish
the
mouthfeel
is
full
and
creamy
with
no
lack
of
flavor
power
this
blows
away
all
other
blonde
ales
i
have
had
which
to
me
is
a
fairly
weak
style
to
begin
with
ive
already
gone
through
2
sixers
and
will
be
buying
many
more
as
it
will
make
a
fantastic
summer
beer
love
it
one
of
the
better
blonde
ales
ive
had
though
its
not
a
style
i
seek
out
the
bready
maltiness
makes
it
a
step
above
most
grainy
offerings
i
am
taking
some
of
these
to
my
bmc
friends
to
see
what
they
think
show
them
there
is
other
beer
out
there
d
pretty
good
and
i
love
the
lable
art
pours
a
hazy
light
copper
colour
with
a
minimal
head
that
doesnt
subside
too
much
the
first
thing
i
though
when
i
stuck
my
nose
into
the
glass
was
dang
it
i
forgot
to
make
bread
today
theres
an
overwhelming
smell
of
bread
dough
with
some
floral
undertones
and
a
malty
sweetness
the
taste
is
not
challenging
by
that
i
mean
its
good
but
fairly
middle
of
the
road
not
too
sweet
not
too
hoppy
not
too
bitter
and
with
a
medium
body
this
style
of
beer
when
brewed
by
a
craft
brewer
is
almost
craft
beer
with
training
wheels
and
is
hopefully
a
stepping
stone
for
the
macro
beer
drinker
to
develop
a
more
discerning
palate
for
someone
who
drinks
something
like
arrogant
bastard
or
sierra
nevada
torpedo
this
beer
will
be
as
easy
to
drink
as
a
glass
of
water
but
for
someone
who
wants
to
try
something
other
than
budmilloors
its
a
great
first
step
into
beer
advocacy
flavor
starts
off
with
some
biscuity
sweetness
from
the
pale
malts
that
combines
with
nutty
notes
along
the
way
hops
are
fairly
muted
but
distinctively
floral
and
saved
for
the
back
of
the
palate
where
they
add
a
slight
bitterness
to
the
finish
mouthfeel
is
solid
with
a
great
carbonation
level
mediumthin
body
and
a
smooth
somewhat
dry
finish
that
both
refreshes
and
leaves
me
wanting
another
sip
this
blonde
bombshell
did
her
job
well
keep
up
the
good
work
southern
star
overall
a
very
nice
beer
i
wish
it
had
a
little
better
mouthfeel
pours
a
golden
yellow
colored
amber
body
with
a
frothy
white
head
good
lacing
somewhat
diminishing
somewhat
fruity
aroma
some
pale
hoppiness
no
very
strong
hoppy
dryish
taste
tasty
light
taste
creamylike
i
had
this
at
the
oktoberfest
party
this
and
real
ale
are
the
two
standards
for
the
style
imo
easy
to
drink
a
good
flavor
and
not
too
heavy
hard
to
beat
on
a
hot
day
or
anytime
d
this
is
a
session
beer
all
the
way
generally
not
a
style
that
gets
me
excited
but
i
could
drink
this
all
day
while
watching
sports
worth
trying
they
really
did
nail
it
probably
the
best
nondark
spiced
beer
ive
ever
had
well
integrated
and
nothing
artificial
about
the
flavors
the
mouth
feel
is
velvety
lending
itself
well
to
the
vanilla
makes
me
want
to
try
white
chocolate
the
smell
is
kind
of
awful
i
dont
know
what
im
about
to
get
when
i
stick
it
under
my
nose
but
then
i
taste
it
and
bam
theres
the
cinnamon
rice
and
vanilla
that
you
know
is
horchata
is
it
the
best
beer
ever
maybe
not
but
did
they
nail
what
its
supposed
to
be
yes
i
adore
this
beer
the
smell
and
taste
are
delicious
and
they
absolutely
nailed
it
one
sip
and
i
feel
like
im
at
a
taqueria
on
a
hot
summer
day
drinking
horchata
on
ice
out
of
a
plastic
cup
with
a
faint
dusting
of
cinnamon
on
top
i
cant
get
enough
of
this
smells
like
your
average
lager
with
a
hint
of
cinnamon
tastes
rich
and
creamy
with
tasty
cinnamon
accents
spot
on
delicious
lots
of
vanilla
and
cinnamon
in
this
beer
flavor
is
very
different
but
not
bad
would
go
nice
with
a
spiced
desert
o
such
a
fun
easy
drinking
beer
the
bruery
knows
how
to
make
an
odd
mix
of
ingredients
come
together
and
be
a
pleasure
to
drink
my
buddies
didnt
like
it
as
much
as
me
very
sweet
definitely
a
sipper
or
xata
pours
a
nice
yellow
beer
foamy
smells
a
bit
to
some
yeast
and
vegetables
taste
sweet
o
this
isnt
offensive
but
i
dont
find
it
particularly
drinkable
i
think
a
threeounce
taster
would
have
been
enough
to
see
that
its
a
beer
with
some
interesting
flavors
and
then
been
done
with
it
in
the
end
i
couldnt
make
it
through
even
my
halfbottle
pour
before
sharing
it
with
the
drain
just
too
sweet
and
not
enough
complexity
to
make
it
worth
pushing
through
overall
an
interesting
and
cool
achievement
by
the
bruery
a
blond
ale
no
but
a
cool
drink
definitely
it
is
refreshing
and
nice
especially
when
the
weather
is
getting
hotter
great
scent
of
horchata
with
a
big
vanilla
nose
golden
body
that
drinks
quite
smooth
there
is
a
sweet
bite
at
the
beginning
for
me
the
vanilla
really
takes
over
but
you
get
a
roundness
from
the
rice
im
not
getting
a
ton
of
cinnamon
which
might
add
a
little
more
depth
really
fun
to
try
but
quite
sweet
o
this
beer
hit
the
marks
they
were
going
for
and
im
sure
fresh
the
vanilla
was
much
more
apparent
very
well
crafted
and
very
well
done
i
dont
know
if
well
be
seeing
this
one
again
but
i
wouldnt
be
opposed
to
it
o
im
not
a
huge
fan
of
blonde
ales
however
or
xata
does
not
taste
anything
like
a
typical
blonde
ale
and
is
extremely
unique
nailing
what
they
are
going
for
the
aroma
was
way
too
sweet
and
unbalanced
with
too
much
cinnamon
and
sweet
vanilla
bean
however
the
taste
in
my
opinion
was
as
spot
on
as
it
could
be
with
nice
vanilla
bean
qualities
balanced
with
a
pinch
of
cinnamon
and
rice
pudding
overall
if
you
love
rice
pudding
and
unique
beers
id
definitely
check
this
beer
out
if
you
dont
id
probably
stay
away
overall
having
had
two
or
xata
beers
i
can
safely
say
i
dont
think
i
would
enjoy
the
title
beverage
the
taste
is
unusual
but
good
pretty
interesting
considering
the
origin
of
the
idea
i
have
made
horchata
and
shared
with
others
who
enjoy
this
specialty
and
it
is
not
exactly
what
you
would
expect
i
think
the
flavor
of
the
alcohol
is
what
seems
to
distract
from
the
drink
it
pays
tribute
to
i
understand
the
brewer
who
created
this
is
not
known
for
low
alcohol
versions
of
any
style
but
to
me
the
spice
is
the
best
part
of
the
taste
a
little
less
rice
tangyness
may
have
helped
i
think
this
is
pretty
decent
for
what
it
is
but
to
me
it
missed
the
mark
if
horchata
or
or
xata
is
what
they
wanted
to
pay
tribute
to
i
think
for
a
first
taste
of
anything
remotely
similar
to
the
original
beverage
it
is
better
than
average
thanks
again
adam
so
glad
i
got
to
try
this
this
is
a
medium
to
lighter
bodied
brew
with
a
very
mild
amount
of
carbonation
having
never
had
the
drink
that
is
the
inspiration
for
this
brew
i
dont
know
how
to
grade
this
i
will
say
though
that
this
pretty
much
drinks
exactly
as
advertised
with
the
listed
ingredients
quite
unique
and
worth
a
try
i
just
have
a
difficult
time
scoring
this
since
it
is
unlike
anything
ive
had
before
and
really
just
isnt
beerlike
in
any
way
poured
into
bruery
snifter
appearance
is
clear
gold
with
minimal
head
and
no
lacing
the
nose
is
very
sweet
notes
of
brown
sugar
cinnamon
and
caramel
come
first
followed
by
heavy
vanilla
character
taste
is
super
sweet
up
front
with
notes
of
burnt
sugar
mild
cinnamon
sweet
cream
and
caramel
the
flavor
is
reminiscent
of
horchata
but
id
say
this
beer
comes
off
a
few
degrees
more
sweet
than
most
horchatas
mouthfeel
is
bordering
on
syrupy
with
moderate
carbonation
overall
the
bruery
did
a
good
job
of
translating
the
delicious
mexican
beverage
into
beer
form
the
resulting
beer
is
very
sweet
and
serves
as
more
of
a
dessert
drink
than
anything
else
pours
medium
dark
amber
fairly
cloudy
but
pretty
far
from
opaquely
so
small
to
medium
off
white
head
mostly
dies
off
after
a
minute
or
two
the
aroma
is
heavy
on
vanilla
and
ground
rice
the
cinnamon
provides
some
depth
and
spice
as
with
the
beers
inspiration
it
smells
about
as
close
to
mexicanstyle
horchata
as
i
can
imagine
for
a
beer
a
relatively
mild
boozy
note
smells
a
little
syrupy
though
less
maple
and
more
agave
or
simple
syrupy
the
taste
is
somewhat
sweet
with
a
lot
of
that
same
vanilla
rice
flavor
its
rich
but
also
somewhat
cloying
lots
of
funny
sweetness
in
the
finish
with
a
light
boozy
note
its
not
altogether
heavy
on
the
palate
but
it
is
rather
heavy
for
the
abv
i
would
guess
that
this
beer
would
be
a
mess
at
10
abv
its
an
interesting
beverage
and
i
applaud
the
effort
but
its
not
altogether
pleasant
to
drink
its
like
boozy
horchata
which
isnt
something
that
i
particularly
like
i
guess
improves
as
it
warms
but
still
i
would
have
preferred
to
split
this
one
with
a
group
and
just
get
a
tasters
worth
quarter
finger
head
on
a
hazy
copper
body
with
nice
lacing
aroma
is
a
bit
light
but
whats
there
is
nice
with
gingerbread
cinnamon
rum
vanilla
caramel
and
butterscotch
the
flavor
follows
with
a
stronger
presence
which
for
me
is
a
little
too
unbalanced
and
sweet
with
again
butterscotch
vanilla
rum
toffee
and
caramel
with
light
malt
presence
medium
body
and
moderate
carbonation
this
one
isnt
bad
but
it
doesnt
really
appeal
to
my
beer
tastes
that
being
said
you
can
still
tell
its
a
well
brewed
beer
im
glad
to
have
tried
it
but
im
also
glad
i
didnt
have
to
drink
it
alone
o
not
perfect
but
i
can
definitely
see
what
they
were
going
for
creamy
and
delicious
for
dessert
the
beer
is
copper
hued
with
ruby
highlights
an
inch
or
so
of
off
white
head
with
plenty
of
staying
power
the
aroma
offers
a
huge
dose
of
sweet
vanilla
cinnamon
butterscotch
candies
booze
smells
as
advertised
like
an
alcoholic
horchata
overly
sweet
and
cloying
a
fun
idea
but
the
sweetness
combined
with
alcohol
is
just
too
much
luckily
this
paired
amazingly
well
with
spicy
food
as
any
great
dessert
wine
does
the
sweetness
would
cut
the
spiciness
and
leave
behind
a
playful
and
warm
toasty
caramel
and
honey
finish
that
made
it
fabulous
for
the
occasion
definitely
not
recommended
on
its
own
unless
you
enjoy
the
sensation
of
slowly
acquiring
diabetes
and
far
better
paired
with
either
spicy
mexican
or
thai
food
i
heard
from
an
acquaintance
that
this
fell
off
in
quality
about
a
month
in
and
i
can
tell
this
does
remind
me
of
a
rather
sweet
shakelike
horchata
i
had
in
sd
earlier
this
year
otherwise
its
definitely
not
the
most
practical
offering
but
it
definitely
was
worth
trying
o
overall
a
very
interesting
beer
that
smells
and
tastes
good
in
small
quantities
and
i
imagine
is
exactly
what
they
were
going
for
if
i
had
a
2
oz
pour
of
this
is
at
a
festival
or
a
4oz
pour
as
part
of
a
flight
i
could
find
myself
really
liking
this
one
even
more
but
trying
to
take
down
half
a
bottle
got
a
little
rough
on
the
back
end
of
the
glass
as
it
is
very
sweet
worth
checking
out
and
goes
well
with
mexican
food
but
share
the
bottle
with
34
other
people
o
sweet
but
great
flavors
a
truly
unique
beer
fun
stuff
o
my
wife
being
mexican
and
loving
horchata
was
skeptical
but
we
tried
and
liked
it
not
my
cup
of
tea
but
not
a
bad
beer
i
especially
liked
the
cinnamon
overall
lets
just
say
that
my
girlfriend
hates
the
ipas
and
imperial
syrups
i
normally
drink
and
she
told
me
id
buy
this
to
drink
for
myself
she
was
pretty
sad
when
i
told
her
theyd
probably
only
ever
brew
this
once
if
you
enjoy
horchata
you
will
enjoy
this
brew
overall
i
enjoyed
it
a
lot
but
not
for
everyone
m
big
medium
because
of
how
creamy
and
full
the
lactose
makes
it
pours
a
clear
gold
with
a
foamy
bone
head
that
settles
to
wisps
of
film
on
top
of
the
beer
small
dots
of
lace
form
around
the
glass
on
the
drink
down
smell
is
of
malt
grain
vanilla
cinnamon
and
spice
aromas
taste
is
much
the
same
with
vanilla
cinnamon
and
horchata
flavors
on
the
finish
there
is
a
mild
amount
of
spice
bitterness
on
the
palate
with
each
sip
this
beer
has
a
lower
level
of
carbonation
with
a
slightly
crisp
and
medium
body
mouthfeel
overall
this
is
a
pretty
good
beer
that
is
more
horchata
like
in
the
taste
versus
the
smell
this
beer
is
creamy
smooth
and
tastes
just
like
horchata
has
little
to
no
head
at
the
top
and
leaves
no
lacing
on
the
glass
great
with
mexican
food
if
you
have
a
chance
to
grab
one
of
these
you
should
try
it
one
of
my
favorite
beers
brilliant
horchata
carbonation
7
alcohol
this
may
be
my
new
favorite
beer
it
needs
to
be
in
a
bottle
more
often
this
beer
is
like
a
cream
soda
an
horchata
and
a
butter
beer
from
potterverse
all
in
one
do
yourself
a
favor
and
try
it
overall
ehhhh
i
want
to
like
this
it
has
the
flavors
youd
expect
but
for
me
who
doesnt
eat
or
drink
anything
sweet
its
hard
to
get
through
more
than
a
sip
or
two
however
this
with
dessert
or
mixed
in
ice
cream
or
pancakes
yum
o
overall
i
enjoyed
this
beer
it
would
be
a
chore
to
get
through
a
whole
bottle
though
still
very
well
executed
take
on
the
cultural
beverage
this
is
really
good
and
goes
down
super
easily
i
finished
a
whole
bottle
in
less
than
a
half
hour
like
it
was
nothing
and
felt
the
subsequent
buzz
a
slightly
different
beer
id
almost
say
its
like
a
blonde
version
of
a
gingerbread
stout
worth
a
try
for
sure
overall
while
i
dont
love
horchata
this
beer
is
right
on
the
money
they
made
horchata
into
a
beer
the
bottle
calls
this
a
blonde
beer
but
it
is
what
it
is
great
experimental
brew
odd
but
tasty
this
beer
really
does
what
it
sets
out
to
accomplish
and
drinks
exactly
like
an
alcoholic
horchata
this
is
an
even
better
option
to
pair
with
mexican
food
as
well
as
being
a
great
summertime
beer
id
love
to
have
a
4
pack
of
tallboys
for
a
day
at
the
beach
a
really
delicious
american
experimental
ale
and
i
think
the
bruery
pulled
off
exactly
what
they
intended
with
this
one
looking
forward
to
pairing
my
next
bottle
with
carne
asada
nachos
because
why
not
super
drinkable
nice
subtle
bitterness
i
wasnt
expecting
overall
a
satisfying
beer
but
goes
slightly
wrong
for
me
somewhere
probably
in
that
slight
bitterness
unbalance
i
picked
up
i
dont
think
the
carb
helped
that
so
much
later
on
in
the
beer
but
a
decent
bottle
nonetheless
a
crackery
malt
profile
makes
this
beer
slightly
different
from
a
classic
american
pale
ale
which
this
very
much
tastes
like
sn
pale
ale
bear
republic
grand
am
overall
this
is
a
flavorful
beer
and
the
2014
edition
is
only
5
0
abv
it
tasted
stronger
than
that
which
i
enjoyed
the
blonde
ales
ive
had
before
have
been
pretty
boring
and
monotone
but
that
wasnt
the
case
with
knockout
blonde
sean
lawson
has
a
knack
for
interpreting
styles
with
a
certain
verve
and
panache
i
wish
i
was
able
to
get
more
of
these
as
i
enjoyed
it
more
than
i
expected

it
pours
a
mildly
hazy
goldenrod
topped
by
a
fingerandahalf
of
creamwhite
foam
the
nose
comprises
light
orange
zest
mild
brettlike
funk
light
wheat
and
a
smidgen
of
bold
banana
a
strong
whiff
of
lemon
zest
wafts
up

the
taste
holds
notes
of
waxy
lemon
rind
light
brettish
funk
dirt
and
a
vague
but
sharp
bitterness
that
pervades
the
finish
and
malingers
a
bit
the
body
is
a
light
medium
with
a
light
moderate
carbonation
and
a
dry
finish
overall
i
found
the
odd
bitterness
to
be
too
much
to
overcome
here
especially
considering
the
style
not
my
cup
o
tea
poured
from
bottle
purchased
at
the
coop
pours
a
nice
clear
golden
with
thick
foamy
head
really
great
hop
aromas
citrus
and
pine
taste
is
a
bit
blah
it
has
very
little
personality
and
is
super
dry
well
blonde
ales
in
general
are
usually
pretty
lacking
in
flavor
and
personality
so
i
guess
when
compared
to
most
blonde
ales
this
has
way
more
to
offer
including
abv
nice
brew
and
somewhat
superior
blonde
but
when
it
comes
to
overall
drinking
experience
lawson
makes
better
brews
than
this
oan
interesting
blonde
ale
easy
drinking
overall
a
excellent
easy
drinking
hopforward
beer
nothing
really
blonde
about
it
just
doesnt
quite
have
the
heft
to
make
it
a
pale
ale
i
guess
overall
the
best
session
beer
ive
ever
had
probably
i
just
had
two
hill
farmstead
blondes
the
other
night
and
im
fooling
myself
into
thinking
that
blondes
are
all
like
this
only
in
abv
is
this
a
blonde
its
really
like
a
super
hoppy
pale
ale
really
nice
enjoyed
on
tap
at
the
black
back
club
a
tasty
blonde
funk
in
the
taste
a
funky
dirty
blonde
nice
hops
piney
and
a
little
citrus
a
sipper
lace
sheet
complex
and
something
i
would
have
on
a
regular
basis
as
it
would
yield
different
flavour
profile
each
time
o
this
was
an
interesting
blonde
ale
im
usually
not
a
huge
fan
of
blonde
ales
but
this
one
wasnt
bad
although
definitely
not
my
favorite
lawsons
offering
i
recommend
trying
it
if
you
like
blonde
ales
but
definitely
not
a
must
have
o
not
what
i
expected
from
the
label
which
listed
cascade
and
centennial
hops
but
i
go
no
aroma
or
flavour
from
them
perhaps
they
were
used
just
for
bittering
this
beer
was
true
to
the
style
overall
pretty
good
mostly
drinkable
except
the
big
bitter
spicy
earthy
hop
finish
and
slight
oily
taste
big
hop
character
for
a
blond
but
nice
malts
the
hops
go
a
little
overboard
but
still
tasty
cheers
o
overall
this
is
a
fairly
solid
blonde
from
the
boys
at
lawsons
finest
that
said
theres
better
blonde
offerings
out
there
in
my
opinion
odi
love
extravagantly
hopped
interpretations
of
generally
nonabrasive
beer
styles
this
is
a
vixen
in
a
bottle
she
has
her
asskicker
boots
on
too
very
tasty
but
very
easy
drinking
memorable
surprised
to
see
this
clock
in
at
over
6
abv
feels
like
a
5er
light
golden
orange
with
a
dense
white
head
with
no
real
retention
or
lacing
the
nose
is
enjoyable
with
a
grainy
bready
malt
character
upon
with
a
citrusy
and
fruity
hop
aroma
is
layered
clean
and
nice
this
is
quite
refreshing
the
palate
opens
lightly
bready
a
little
watery
and
with
a
moderate
hop
flavor
with
citrus
honey
and
toast
mildly
bitter
this
beer
is
bready
and
grainy
on
the
finish
clean
a
little
grassy
and
moderately
hoppy
thoroughly
enjoyable
the
alcohol
is
wellhidden

think
this

or
so
excellent
representation
of
the
style
split
one
with
my
girlfriend
with
the
first
sip
it
is
s
weet
then
the
hops
come
on
with
a
smooth
nonlingering
finish
very
enjoyable
could
drink
a
few
of
these
quite
easily
best
blonde
ale
ive
ever
had
beer
is
medium
to
light
in
body
wet
finish
no
after
taste
a
moderate
bitterness
on
the
back
end
a
very
enjoyable
beer
id
definitely
have
it
again
on
draft
at
prohibition
pig
in
waterbury
vt
served
in
a
lawsons
finest
liquids
snifter
classy
the
beer
appears
crystal
clear
and
light
orange
hued
with
an
inch
of
foamy
white
head
the
aroma
is
mild
offering
a
touch
of
hops
bready
malts
the
flavor
brings
notes
of
citrus
followed
by
sourdough
bread
and
a
bitter
hop
finish
light
bodied
and
flavorful
a
solid
example
of
the
style
mediumlight
bodied
medium
carbonation
crisp
and
dry
a
good
beer
but
not
the
apex
of
the
lawsons
portfolio
big
thanks
goes
out
to
beeruser
for
sharing
this
one
at
a
recent
tasting
served
from
bottle
into
a
boulevard
tulip
poured
a
golden
yellow
with
a
half
finger
white
head
that
subsided
to
a
minimal
amount
quickly
maintained
nice
lacing
throughout
the
glass
the
aroma
was
comprised
of
sweet
malt
earth
earth
hop
and
fruit
the
flavor
was
of
sweet
malt
earth
earth
hop
fruit
and
wheat
it
had
a
light
feel
on
the
palate
with
mediumhigh
carbonation
overall
this
was
a
decent
brew
while
this
was
fairly
nice
for
the
style
nothing
on
it
really
stood
out
from
anything
else
ive
had
i
really
wish
it
would
have
been
a
little
more
complex
here
if
i
am
completely
honest
the
earthy
characters
going
on
here
were
definitely
the
dominate
aspect
going
on
worth
trying
if
you
get
the
chance
but
personally
i
wouldnt
go
out
of
my
way
to
do
so
a
very
nice
tasty
blonde
nice
representation
of
the
style
the
feel
is
smooth
and
goes
down
easy
this
has
a
good
medium
body
and
was
just
about
right
for
the
hot
day
i
am
drinking
this
on
knockout
blonde
pours
a
light
bodied
bright
honey
gold
in
color
with
a
one
finger
bright
white
head
it
looks
great
the
nose
is
pretty
bland
and
average
for
the
style
just
pale
malts
and
honey
the
flavors
are
somewhat
dry
and
bitter
it
features
pale
malt
an
ever
so
slight
touch
of
honey
and
a
prominent
bitterness
perhaps
from
the
hops
that
said
it
certainly
isnt
hoppy
it
drinks
light
and
dry
and
is
really
a
pretty
mellow
beer
i
wouldnt
necessarily
buy
this
if
i
saw
it
but
it
wouldnt
be
a
bad
beer
to
open
after
a
hot
day
ate
pool
or
in
the
yard
from
the
22
ounce
bottle
that
was
part
of
the
2012
batch
sampled
on
june
2
2012
the
pour
is
a
slightly
cloudy
strawpale
yellow
with
a
fizzy
foamy
white
head
that
settles
down
eventually
the
aroma
is
full
of
earthy
piney
hops
with
a
little
zesty
citrus
grainy
malts
and
some
yeast
the
body
is
in
the
medium
range
but
kind
of
acidic
the
taste
begins
grainy
with
a
moderate
to
bold
bitter
hop
note
on
the
end
but
with
each
taste
the
hop
flavor
warms
and
grows
an
enjoyable
beer
the
knockout
blonde
is
a
nurturing
ale
living
up
to
its
vivacious
name
it
is
a
fine
beer
to
look
at
in
the
glass
and
its
scent
is
attractive
and
fetching
imagine
the
light
airy
yeasty
aroma
of
bread
in
a
hearth
coasting
through
the
air
on
a
summers
day
take
that
bright
light
malty
tone
and
imagine
the
staccato
notes
of
grapefruit
and
pine
from
a
lingering
hop
presence
the
taste
is
exactly
like
the
scent
it
is
a
perfect
summer
beer
to
me
the
mouthfeel
is
spectacular
it
leaves
a
pleasant
thickness
at
the
back
of
the
mouth
and
finishes
a
bit
dry
with
the
hops
this
is
a
spectacular
ale
and
another
wonderful
accomplishment
by
lawsons
hv
aroma
was
light
but
nice
and
complex
with
light
hops
light
notes
of
peach
and
light
grain
really
come
through
right
now
warming
brought
a
smidge
of
citrus
to
it
and
really
let
the
light
fruit
notes
pop
crisp
clean
flavor
though
with
light
hints
of
clove
and
heather
that
sat
on
top
of
a
base
that
resembled
mostly
light
fruits
and
hints
of
grain
smooth
light
body
was
not
overly
carbonated
but
rather
a
bit
silky
and
left
just
the
right
amount
of
dryness
on
the
tongue
its
hard
to
imagine
that
blondes
and
cream
ales
were
created
by
the
microbrew
movement
as
an
alternative
to
light
and
pale
lagers
this
beer
is
a
huge
departure
from
these
beer
in
the
taste
department
knockout
is
bmc
pale
with
a
nice
sticky
head
crisp
hops
and
slightly
sweet
malt
decorate
the
nose
the
beer
is
super
bitter
with
a
nice
crisp
mouthfeel
and
a
dry
finish
very
good
i
wish
this
were
easier
to
get
here
in
philly
because
this
would
be
a
great
bbq
beer
o
definitely
a
different
take
on
the
blonde
ale
and
certainly
for
the
better
overall
good
beer
that
could
easily
be
lost
in
the
sea
of
ipas
and
double
ipas
as
a
blond
ale
this
one
is
fantastic
to
be
fair
its
really
hopped
up
for
the
style
but
it
still
doesnt
feel
out
of
balance
and
i
could
drink
this
all
night
long
possibly
the
best
blond
ale
ive
ever
had
pours
light
a
light
translucent
orange
the
keyword
there
is
translucent
light
passes
through
but
there
isnt
really
any
clarity
to
speak
of
mostly
hop
bitterness
on
the
nose
nothing
terribly
exciting
here
first
thing
i
detect
is
a
bready
flavor
but
the
hops
come
through
at
the
finish
ultimately
there
doesnt
seem
to
be
too
much
going
on
with
this
beer
but
thats
fine
as
nothing
about
it
offends
the
palate
really
i
feel
like
i
could
keep
drinking
it
all
night
too
bad
ive
only
got
one
medium
thick
body
sharply
carbonated
with
a
grainy
and
citric
hop
finish
flavor
has
a
strong
biscuit
and
bready
malt
body
with
a
smooth
though
not
particularly
bitter
green
hop
taste
more
of
an
apa
than
a
blonde
the
hops
though
well
balanced
by
the
malt
body
are
still
potent
and
aggressive
a
solid
all
around
offering
but
not
quite
as
exciting
as
double
sunshine
is
taste
is
awesome
generally
i
find
blonde
ales
to
be
pretty
meh
but
this
is
very
well
done
the
c
hops
really
give
this
something
to
work
with
its
bitter
and
sweet
while
still
being
very
easy
drinking
and
smooth
the
mouthfeel
is
spot
on
a
bit
thick
with
light
carbonation
theres
a
bitter
finish
that
rounds
it
out
well
will
look
to
score
it
again
when
available
d
my
third
beer
by
this
brewery
and
i
continue
to
be
impressed
this
has
got
to
be
one
of
the
easiest
drinking
beers
of
all
time
thanks
again
michael
please
keep
the
lawsons
beers
coming
a
big
thanks
to
jedwards
for
breaking
this
out
bottle
98
out
of
168
pours
a
beautiful
orangegold
with
a
semihazy
clarity
no
head
on
this
one
nose
is
light
and
citrusy
on
a
pale
malt
backbone
taste
follows
nose
with
a
pleasant
pinycitrusy
hops
character
in
the
mix
mouthfeel
is
lightmedium
in
consistency
but
closer
to
light
with
a
lively
carbonation
not
a
big
complex
beer
but
perhaps
the
best
example
of
the
style
ive
had
the
opportunity
to
try
to
date
easy
drinking
and
quite
flavorful
i
would
drink
this
all
the
time
if
it
were
more
readily
available
the
beer
is
light
bodied
well
carbonated
and
has
a
nice
bitter
dry
finish
the
6
abv
is
well
incorporated
into
the
flavors
this
one
is
very
drinkable
i
was
i
had
more
than
one
bottle
pours
a
golden
color
with
a
hint
of
peach
there
is
a
onefinger
white
head
with
some
spotty
lacing
the
nose
brings
some
grains
and
quite
a
bit
of
fresh
hops
there
is
a
bit
of
light
amarillolike
hops
fresh
and
a
bit
of
green
hops
there
are
also
some
light
pine
and
floral
notes
definite
fresh
hop
flavor
with
some
floral
and
herbal
notes
light
to
medium
body
and
quite
drinkable
slightly
darker
than
your
typical
blonde
ale
the
hop
character
does
not
jump
out
in
the
smell
but
is
definitely
present
when
you
take
a
drink
i
typically
expect
and
love
lots
of
hops
in
the
lawsons
beer
but
this
one
is
more
mellow
overall
a
nice
take
on
a
blonde
ale
very
refreshing
beer
with
a
nice
balanced
hopmalt
profile
to
it
would
love
to
have
a
stock
of
these
available
during
the
summer
months
wow
this
certainly
is
a
knockout
for
the
style
at
6
1
its
the
big
sister
to
papelblonde
i
cant
really
think
of
much
else
that
could
top
this
stylewise
kudos
to
sean
for
yet
another
excellent
style
interpretation
mouthfeel
is
light
to
medium
bodied
with
medium
carbonation
a
pretty
nice
blonde
ale
very
drinkable
and
refreshing
with
some
nice
character

golden

with

if
i
could
get
this
in

pack
it
would
always
be
in
my
fridge
not
sure
if
this
really
should
be
called
a
blonde
but
regardless
i
its
too
good
to
not
get
high
marks
more
to
come
from

i
have
ever

ill
definitely
be
tossing
these
back
for
most
of
the

this
is
the

i
wonder
if
i
got
a
bad
batch
the
beer
was
just
odd
tasted
at
the
tap
room
overall
it
is
a
nice
session
drinker
no
complaints
but
it
is
little
tough
to
get
too
excited
about
this
one
mouth
is
crisp
and
inviting
this
is
an
easy
drinking
session
beer
with
enough
facets
to
keep
you
coming
back
well
done
an
interesting
and
not
typical
blonde
ale
looks
nice
but
cloudy
good
head
interesting
body
full
carries
way
more
body
than
a
blonde
ale
usually
does
if
this
were
what
a
blonde
ale
typically
was
id
be
happy
unfortunately
that
isnt
the
case
other
brewers
should
follow
this
lead
either
way
a
nice
beer
to
try
this
is
like
a
lighter
version
of
daisy
cutter
good
doses
of
tropical
fruits
easily
one
of
the
best
american
blonde
ales
that
ive
ever
had
overall
it
really
doesnt
balance
well
just
throwing
hops
at
a
beer
does
not
make
it
interesting
or
complex
just
hoppy
one
trick
pony
o
overall
a
decent
blonde
ale
though
with
cans
of
daisy
cutter
also
on
the
menu
no
real
reason
to
get
more
than
one
of
this
some
nice
fruit
in
the
nose
though
the
taste
is
a
little
blander
would
have
it
again
thought
wouldnt
specifically
seek
it

pretty

with
hardly
anything

overall
this
is
a
damn
nice
blonde
ale
very
nice
hoppy
flavor
with
good
malt
balance
and
extremely
easy
to
drink
a
very
enjoyable
offering
o
this
beer
is
very
sessionable
with
its
low
abv
and
smoothness
id
enjoy
this
on
a
hot
summer
day
this
is
also
one
of
half
acres
year
round
beers
and
even
though
it
isnt
very
special
it
is
still
a
good
flagship
beer
thats
respectable
to
their
name
full
body
for
a
lighter
gold
ale
semisweet
grains
on
the
tip
of
the
tongue
lightly
buttery
on
the
middle
of
the
tongue
citric
and
floral
hop
finishes
balances
nicely
lingering
hoppyness
in
the
mouth
held
back
and
slightly
boring
but
what
blonde
ale
isnt
nice
and
clean
and
tasty
though
the
mouthfeel
was
medium
to
thin
with
a
smooth
mild
carbonation
o
this
is
a
nice
blonde
ale
nothing
too
spectacular
but
very
sessionable
poured
a
golden
color
to
a
russian
river
pint
glass
with
a
fingers
width
of
white
head
smell
is
mild
but
some
danky
hop
resins
and
mild
citrus
taste
is
very
nice
for
being
such
a
mild
beer
i
could
honestly
drink
this
beer
all
day
long
with
pleasure
nice
citrus
hop
is
most
noticeable
slightly
floral
and
refreshing
o
very
solid
overall
and
one
of
the
better
if
not
the
best
blonde
ive
ever
head
drinking
many
of
these
on
a
hot
day
would
be
no
problem
o
average
for
the
style
o
really
like
this
beer
i
give
it
bonus
points
for
doing
all
that
it
does
at
only
4

if
there
is
a
better
springsummer
session
beer
i
have
yet
to
come
across
it
poured
from
can
into
dfh
snifter
pours
a
murky
yelloworange
color
decent
lacing
and
head
retention
small
bubbles
come
up
from
the
bottom
of
the
glass
smell
there
is
a
floral
aroma
reminds
me
of
potpourri
and
popcorn
buttery
aroma
orange
peel
as
well
taste
mild
bitterness
with
an
unwanted
soapy
experience
somewhat
watery
a
little
coriander
lemon
peel
this
lacks
body
sweetness
and
is
a
little
high
on
carbonation
i
suppose
if
in
the
summer
this
would
drink
well
from
the
can
if
it
was
a
little
colder
but
this
isnt
that
memorable
a
little
bleh
from
a
schooner
at
the
portillos
in
downtown
chicago
definitely
a
nice
complement
to
the
excellent
hotdogs
but
nothing
terribly
special
very
drinkable
blonde
ale
with
a
semisweet
nose
well
balanced
malt
and
slight
hops
taste
could
have
used
a
little
more
hop
flavor
actually
i
wasnt
looking
for
something
to
blow
me
away
just
a
nice
drinkable
beer
with
lunch
o
somewhat
odd
flavor
profile
but
not
totally
bad
very
grainy
with
a
little
bit
of
bittering
hops
not
bad
for
the
style
but
id
strongly
prefer
daisy
cutter
or
hell
zombie
dust
100
times
out
of
100
o
my
4
5
betrays
some
of
my
other
scores
but
this
beer
is
definitely
in
my
top
3
i
love
it
its
even
better
during
the
summer
i
cant
wait
to
have
a
growler
of
this
in
the
fridge
during
the
warm
days
one
of
my
gotos
when
i
want
to
kick
back
and
have
a
few
o
c
or
b
you
call
it
its
not
a
terrible
beer
but
that
soapy
flavor
really
was
off
putting
for
me
i
dont
know
if
it
was
my
and
my
taste
buds
or
the
can
reveal
half
acre
gossamer
ive
also
seen
this
in
stores
many
times
but
always
reached
for
the
daisy
cutter
really
interesting
4
2
golden
ale
is
not
exactly
what
i
was
thinking
but
i
guess
it
makes
sense
thanks
for
another
beer
ive
been
meaning
to
try
o
this
isnt
your
average
yellow
fizzy
beer
this
stuff
packs
a
punch
of
flavors
if
you
come
across
this
then
pick
some
up
as
these
would
be
perfect
over
a
hot
summery
day
very
sessionable
at
4
2
the
beer
is
golden
hued
with
a
half
inch
of
white
head
the
aroma
brings
some
grain
along
with
some
tropical
citrus
notes
the
flavor
offers
a
lot
of
grain
with
some
musty
citrus
very
bready
easy
to
drink
though
i
would
prefer
the
balance
favor
the
hop
profile
a
bit
more
than
the
grain
light
feel
and
smooth
on
the
palate
overall
highly
drinkable
a
great
choice
for
the
warmer
months
o
verall
solid
beer
decent
sessionable
type
but
blondes
are
not
my
favorite
o
this
one
totally
embodies
the
idea
of
the
session
beer
to
my
mind
i
could
drink
this
all
day
and
cant
wait
to
bring
a
couple
of
these
back
home
so
that
a
couple
of
my
ba
peeps
can
experience
the
magic
the
tastes
is
really
well
balanced
nice
citrus
bitterness
up
front
a
little
malty
sweetness
in
the
middle
and
it
finishes
with
a
combination
between
vanilla
and
sour
light
bodied
and
easy
to
drink
its
not
as
fizzy
as
one
would
expect
overall
one
of
my
standbys
particularly
in
the
summer
having
a
can
of
half
acre
gossamer
golden
ale
after
a
wednesday
hockey
game
2g
5a
in
a
92
win
the
beer
pours
a
golden
straw
color
with
thin
white
head
that
is
leaving
a
mild
lace
the
smell
is
nice
with
a
slight
citrus
hop
the
taste
is
a
combo
of
floral
and
citrus
tones
that
leaves
the
pallet
a
bit
bitter
and
acidic
i
am
guessing
that
columbus
hops
were
used
but
i
am
no
expert
the
mouthfeel
is
light
to
medium
bodies
ales
with
good
carbonation
overall
it
isnt
a
bad
beer
would
be
great
on
hot
days
o
overall
this
is
not
a
style
that
i
jump
for
joy
over
but
hi
enjoyed
this
beer
a
lot
great
example
and
smooth
mouth
this
is
a
beer
that
i
could
drink
all
day
long
in
the
summer
another
great
beer
from
a
great
brewery
this
is
definitely
good
but
its
not
something
i
am
disappointed
that
i
cant
get
regularly
its
good
for
the
style
but
it
could
be
better
im
not
particularly
a
fan
of
the
grassy
aroma
maybe
because
i
am
allergic
to
grass
o
nice
refreshing
golden
ale
with
flavorful
hops
thanks
casey
tallboy
can
into
a
pint
glass
bright
golden
body
with
fine
head
sweet
malt
dominates
the
nose
but
decently
balanced
taste
is
smooth
and
mellow
this
isnt
my
favorite
style
but
chicks
seem
to
like
it
a
lotsweet
finish
with
low
alcohol
nothing
crazy
exceptional
here
but
its
a
good
session
blonde
ale
if
youre
into
that
sort
of
thing
decent
deal
in
the
4
tallboy
packs
too
and
nice
to
support
local
breweries
not
sure
if
they
distribute
much
outside
of
the
chicago
area
but
recommended
will
order
it
on
draught
sometime
and
post
a
tap
review
too
as
this
is
frequently
available
on
tap
at
bars
i
go
to
clean
crisp
and
highly
hopped
for
a
blonde
this
is
one
of
the
better
versions
of
the
style
ive
had
overall
easy
to
drink
and
with
just
enough
flavor
to
keep
things
interesting
this
would
be
a
solid
beer
to
have
around
for
drinking
outside
or
on
a
hot
day
half
acre
scores
again
d
very
good
another
great
beer
from
half
acre
always
thrilled
to
try
beers
from
these
guys
this
is
nice
sessionable
blond
ale
that
goes
down
too
easy
in
this
plus
90
degree
weather
here
now
overall
gossamer
is
a
solid
session
brew
with
more
flavour
and
hop
character
than
your
average
blonde
ale
perfect
for
summer
time
patio
drinking
and
definitely
worth
a
try
o
a
nice
beer
for
warmer
days
where
the
just
need
some
crisp
clean
beer
that
is
easy
drinking
and
still
provides
a
little
flavor
and
body
not
an
earth
shaking
beer
but
it
has
its
spot
and
fits
well
thankfully
i
drank
this
on
a
hot
day
where
i
did
plenty
of
activity
so
fit
perfectly
overall
this
is
a
really
nice
summer
beer
low
abv
light
mouthfeel
and
a
crisp
refreshing
taste
good
beer
o
quite
easy
drinking
though
not
surprising
given
how
light
this
beer
is
a
very
good
enjoyable
session
beer
o
very
likely
the
best
blond
ale
ive
had
i
could
blow
through
a
lot
of
these
on
a
sunday
afternoon
refreshing
and
very
drinkable
blond
ale
nice
hop
like

little

terms
of
mouthfeel
it
stays
at
a

with
a

overall
this
is
a
mostly
average
beer
i
do
appreciate
the
unexpected
or
unique
flavors
here
i
just
wish
that
they
stuck
around
from
the
initial
taste
through
to
the
finish
overall
decent
beer
not
terrible
i
could
drink
it
again
its
definitely
a
sessionable

abv
refreshing
would
i
buy
more
of
it
absolutely
just
like
their
daisy
cutter
pale
ale
this
would
be
on
the
grocery
list
each
week
if
i
lived
in
chicago
o
overall
this
a
very
refreshing
and
enjoyable
brew
perfect
for
a
lazy
summer
afternoon
or
a
day
at
the
beach
if
this
were
available
to
me
locally
i
would
certainly
have
it
on
a
regular
basis
very
tasty
finish
great
finish
smooth
i
loved
this
beer
perfect
for
the
summer
it
gives
great
taste
without
killing
your
taste
buds
overall
aside
from
being
the
weirdest
looking
beer
i
have
ever
come
across
the
cask
version
of
gossamer
is
a
decisive
improvement
from
the
standard
issue
the
yeast
derived
flavors
add
nice
complexity
and
the
cask
conditioning
make
this
much
more
drinkable
albeit
much
heartier
with
all
of
that
yeast
i
think
ill
be
all
set
on
vitamin
b
for
a
while
o
a
nice
brew
not
one
i
would
seek
out
but
im
glad
i
got
to
try
it
good
brew
in
a
good
trade
try
it
if
you
find
it
i
would
be
a
delicious
summer
camping
brew
very
drinkable
and
local
will
buy
again
o
this
is
my
favorite
session
beer
bar
none
i
could
drink
this
stuff
all
day
and
not
grow
tired
of
it
its
not
too
sweet
to
get
overwhelming
but
has
enough
flavor
to
keep
it
interesting
and
refreshing
o
gossamer
is
refreshing
as
they
come
and
a
joy
to
drink
the
perfect
beer
when
youve
just
finished
mowing
the
lawn
honestly
this
reminds
me
a
lot
of
some
of
the
ipas
i
had
while
in
the
uk
a
couple
of
months
back
due
to
their
tea
like
quality
and
more
muted
hops
especially
when
compared
to
their
american
cousins
ddaisy
cutter
could
be
both
a
success
and
curse
for
half
acre
i
think
that
this
beer
will
always
be
compared
and
it
just
isnt
as
good
it
is
very
light
and
drinkable
i
think
i
would
really
appreciate
having
this
on
a
hot
summer
day
but
given
other
options
there
are
plenty
of
beers
i
would
pick
first
o
i
found
a
nice
easy
camping
beer
with
this
one
the
can
is
an
added
bonus
the
taste
is
somewhat
disappointing
because
the
smell
is
so
pleasant
overall
it
is
an
easy
drinking
session
beer
that
i
would
have
no
qualms
about
having
quite
a
few
in
a
row
good
stuff
when
the
temps
get
rocking
grab
a
gossamer
if
there
is
no
daisy
cutter
maybe
the
best
golden
ale
ive
had
i
normally
dont
buy
them
but
i
will
buy
this
each
chicago
trip
great
session
brew
medium
mouthfeel
and
medium
carbonation
a
very
nice
light
to
medium
hopped
blonde
ale
overall
an
easy
drinking
light
golden
ale
nothing
aggressive
or
offensive
good
all
around
session
beer
as
light
as
a
gossamer
wing
good
light
beer
drinkibility
with
light
flavor
overall
2
while
very
drinkable
its
not
anything
special
a
good
light
beer
with
some
flavor
but
not
something
ill
come
back
to
frequently
if
ever
o
this
beer
surprised
me
very
easy
drinkability
i
could
throw
down
a
bunch
of
these
on
a
hot
summer
day
d
golden
ales
arent
the
most
complex
beers
out
there
but
this
one
did
a
pretty
good
job
of
keeping
itself
interesting
i
really
enjoyed
the
daisy
cutter
and
enjoyed
this
one
too
half
acre
keeps
impressing
me
o
a
solid
blonde
ale
ill
admit
this
usually
isnt
the
type
of
beer
i
would
normally
buy
if
i
were
searching
the
beer
cooler
at
my
local
shop
this
beer
is
a
fine
example
and
very
refreshing
i
can
only
imagine
how
nice
this
beer
would
be
if
i
were
outside
shooting
a
round
of
disc
golf
this
would
be
a
perfect
beer
to
take
to
the
course
i
would
buy
this
if
it
were
available
it
would
be
a
great
summer
ale
or
party
beer
i
would
absolutely
use
this
beer
to
convert
bmc
drinkers
o
a
lowweight
blonde
ale
just
a
hair
above
4
more
please
especially
the
orange
citrus
and
grassy
hops
d
mmmm
session
beer
for
sure
d
great
session
brew
i
still
prefer
daisy
cutter
over
this
but
quite
flavorful
for
such
a
low
abv
brew
check
out
half
acre
brews
you
will
be
impressed
excellent
summer
and
newbie
brew
judging
by
other
reviews
id
say
i
got
an
old
can
but
with
no
dating
i
cant
be
sure
very
crisp
and
flavorful
for
a
golden
ale
done
an
american
way
with
the
crisp
attenuation
and
citrus
hop
notes
an
allpurpose
beer
with
a
near
sessionable
quality
this
is
an
absolute
joy
to
drink
a
very
easy
drinking
ale
from
the
folks
at
half
acre

to

the
nose

potent
for
the
style
the

is
much
more
full

expected

good
carbonation
plenty
of
hops
at
the
forefront
of
this
one
mild

but
juicy
citrus
flavors

grasslike
qualities
noted
some
mild
hay
this
beer
breaks
away
from
the
norm
on
the
style
by
packing
plenty
of
flavor
good
beer
thanks
for
the
opportunity

and
white

with
a
hint
of
grassy

overall
the
flavor
is
mild
with
a
decent
mixture
of
tastes
the
beer
is
not
overly
complex
but
is
decent
session
beer
that
could
be
consumed
while
watching
a
game
at
the
pub
with
friends
and
not
get
bloated
full
or
bored
its
good
for
what
it
is
color
me
impressed
not
a
beer
i
anticipated
liking
based
on
the
style
i
was
pleasantly
surprised
flavorful
enough
to
keep
me
interested
and
light
enough
to
drank
several
in
a
sitting
i
would
pick
this
up
on
somewhat
of
a
regular
basis
if
it
were
available
here
all
of
which
makes
it
sound
more
complex
than
it
is
it
isnt
quick
simple
hitter
that
slips
away
quickly
but
without
making
much
of
an
impression
good
solid
session
brew
small
brewers
are
you
paying
attention
make
more
of
these
lighter
body
higher
carbonation
a
little
sticky
and
dry
quick
drinking
alcohol
is
invisible
and
the
flavors
are
decent
enough
for
the
style
the
nose
was
oddly
subdued
although
id
enjoy
this
during
the
warmer
weather
notes
insanely
drinkable
and
super
tasty
dont
think
i
could
get
bored
with
this
one
i
thought
it
was
a
very
sessionable
drinkergrainy
malts
sweet
grassy
hops

with
a
pop
of
bitter
orange
rind
maybe
a
little
bit
overcarbonatedit
felt
gassybut
also
pretty
creamy
and
smooth
goes
great
with
pizza
beer
is
pretty
thin
and
a
little
watery
there
is
a
lot
of
fruit
hop
flavors
in
the
midpalate
and
the
finish
is
so
wet
that
there
is
no
chance
for
an
aftertaste
almost
there
is
a
really
late
aftertaste
of
grains
that
comes
much
after
youve
finish
overall
its
a
decent
blonde
id
have
it
again
i
love
the
artwork
on
the
can
and
the
flavors
and
aroma
were
interesting
this
beer
is
exactly
what
it
is
supposed
to
be
it
is
light
refreshing
and
pretty
damn
tasty
i
tend
to
find
american
blondes
either
so
light
that
i
shudder
to
call
them
beer
or
to
sweet
and
cloying
on
the
palate
gossamer
bridges
the
gap
nicely
it
has
a
decent
body
a
crisp
clean
taste
and
is
not
overly
sweet
it
pours
a
beautiful
gold
with
an
impressive
head
and
consistent
carbonation
running
up
from
the
bottom
not
much
smell
but
there
is
a
little
fruity
estery
thing
going
on
there
this
is
a
lawnmowergrilling
beer
it
almost
seems
like
a
mistake
to
focus
heavily
on
tasting
notes
super
drinkable
light
refreshing
and
easy
to
drink
i
was
unaware
that
this
was
a
style
but
this
seems
to
be
a
pretty
good
one
all
around
to
me
the
finish
is
drying
but
not
overwhelming
overall
a
very
enjoyable
beer
and
a
welcome
beverage
after
a
day
of
work
around
the
yard
and
house
im
definitely
planning
on
revisiting
this
one
as
soon
as
i
get
the
chance
as
i
find
it
hard
to
believe
that
this
is
legit
looked
and
smelled
very
good
and
then
went
downhill
fast
light
refreshing
and
a
lower
alcohol
content
you
could
drink
this
all
day
long
mouthfeel
drinkability
the
body
of
the
beer
is
light
but
not
thin
carbonation
levels
work
well
for
the
beers
character
this
is
definately
a
throw
back
sessionable
beer
i
could
drink
a
bunch
of
this
overall
an
average
beer
nothing
to
special
i
have
had
better
from
half
acres
okay
drinkability
you
gotta
love
free
beer
while
touring
a
brewery
right
this
freebie
pours
a
clear
bright
pale
straw
topped
by
about
a
finger
or
so
of
fluffy
white
foam
the
nose
is
a
blast
of
florality
as
though
a
small
meadow
had
been
pressed
into
my
cup
which
had
been
previously
lined
with
some
light
buttery
caramel
the
taste
toned
down
the
florals
by
a
fair
degree
leaving
some
fossils
to
be
gazed
at
while
munching
on
some
watereddown
caramel
corn
basically
tone
down
a
daisy
cutter
a
bit
and
youll
be
left
with
this
that
doesnt
mean
i
dislike
this
flavor
by
any
stretch
its
just
a
way
to
describe
it
the
body
is
pretty
light
with
a
light
moderate
carbonation
and
a
refreshing
feel
overall
a
very
nice
sessionable
blonde
good
times
down
at
half
acre
i
tells
ya
the
one
poured
a
nice
golden
color
with
perhaps
a
minor
haze
to
it
the
head
comprises
of
a
nice
ecru
foam
that
is
pretty
cloudy
and
stiff
the
nose
was
of
hoppy
citrus
notes
as
well
as
some
notes
of
the
pale
malts
that
may
have
been
slightly
roasted
the
taste
was
fairly
uneventful
the
aromas
that
had
been
in
existence
to
give
it
that
extra
pop
were
not
very
evident
as
was
agreed
on
by
the
others
in
my
party
this
tasted
like
a
toneddown
daisy
cutter
there
was
a
wheatlike
breadiness
to
it
that
was
surprising
due
to
the
relative
clarity
of
the
beer
it
sat
rather
well
in
the
mouth
the
carbonation
was
spot
on
and
you
cant
say
anything
against
the
freshness
of
it
overall
it
was
extremely
drinkable
and
very
sessionable
brew
and
something
i
would
recommend
for
a
relaxing
summer
day
drinkability
good
d
very
well
hopped
this
is
the
best
example
of
the
style
ive
had
id
say
still
i
cant
get
a
patton
oswalt
quote
out
of
my
head
when
i
think
of
this
beer
write
it
in
the
sky
with
gossamer
teardrops
battered
chapped
pussy
this
is
a
highly
drinkable
summertime
session
ale
definitely
worth
a
shot

in
a

looking
for

this

i
really
enjoyed
this

the
malt
bill
is
very
good
and
the
hops
are
assertive
im
also
impressed
with
the
flavor
that
is
packed
into

love
that
this

2
beer
in
a
16
oz
can
but
id
like
a
bit
more
american
hops
or
something
to
make
this
anything
more
than
a
typical
blondegolden
ale
pours
a
hazy
golden
color
with
a
large
head
that
had
good
retention
the
head
slowly
settled
to
a
thick
cap
a
large
amount
of
lacing
is
left
on
the
glass
i
pick
up
floral
and
grassy
hops
in
the
aroma
i
do
not
smell
malt
the
flavor
is
more
hoppy
than
most
blonde
ales
the
hops
gives
some
fruity
qualities
to
the
taste
the
malt
has
a
dry
cracker
like
quality
very
clean
taste
bitterness
is
higher
than
most
as
well
light
body
and
nicely
carbonated
feels
lively
and
does
not
linger
on
the
palate
for
long
a
nice
little
blond
ale
that
comes
in
pounders
a
good
summer
brew
with
great
packaging
this
is
a
perfect
lowabv
sessionable
summer
brew
i
really
wish
they
would
distrubute
a
little
further
into
the
western
chicago
burbs
because
i
havent
had
anything
i
havent
liked
from
them
and
there
use
of
hops
is
just
phenomenal
goes
down
really
easy
and
is
a
very
refreshing
beer
also
digging
the
low
alcohol
by
volume
and
the
fact
that
its
canned
a
really
great
american
blonde
from
half
acre
if
they
nailed
the
mouthfeel
it
may
have
helped
bump
up
the
drinkability
by
0
5
as
well
and
made
this
a
solid
a
very
easy
drinking
d
if
you
want
a
sessionable
brew
with
loads
of
malt
flavor
here
you
go
this
is
an
expertly
balanced
brew
i
dont
typically
purchase
golden
ales
or
blonde
ales
not
sure
exactly
what
this
is
can
says
golden
ba
says
blonde
but
this
one
is
special
these
half
acre
cans
are
my
new
summer
go
to
beer
drinkability
is
good
not
a
lot
going
on
with
this
beer
but
the
flavor
has
some
decent
citrus
to
it
the
body
is
fairly
crisp
and
the
abv
is
low
so
a
pint
or
two
of
this
would
be
easy
on
a
hot
day
tastes
light
with
a
hoppy
bitterness
up
front
and
a
watery
slightly
nutty
sweet
malt
finish
with
a
bit
of
floral
honey
character
throughout
very
fresh
clean
flavors
and
wellbalanced
large
rounded
and
slightly
tingly
carbonation
accentuates
an
otherwise
light
body
drinks
like
water
i
might
wish
for
a
little
more
flavor
somewhere
in
the
middle
of
it
all
otherwise
this
is
a
perfect
summer
beer
glad
to
have
tried
it
nothing
like
a
big
blonde
i
got
two
fingers
worth
of
french
vanillacolored
head
off
of
my
initial
pour
which
i
had
to
back
off
of
lest
it
spill
over
the
rim
of
the
glass
color
was
a
slightly
hazy
golden
yellow
and
remember
boys
and
girls
clarity
is
overrated
nose
had
a
fruity
sweetness
like
tangerine
or
melon
or
both
mouthfeel
was
medium
and
the
taste
was
fruity
but
drier
than
the
nose
had
led
me
to
expect
finish
lingered
with
a
pleasant
fruitiness
this
would
be
good
on
a
hot
day
in
the
sun
especially
given
its
low
abv
but
conversely
it
was
not
exciting
enough
to
warrant
seeking
out
for
the
cooler
mouthfeel
is
light
and
the
carbonation
is
on
the
higher
side
drinkability
is
good
it
has
some
very
nice
flavors
to
it
the
crisp
citrus
flavor
was
particularly
nice
and
made
it
a
pretty
nice
and
refreshing
beer
overall
a
very
nice
flavorful
and
well
balanced
beer

dude
this
one
is
definitely
sessionable
this
was
very
tasty
a
light
golden
ale
with
a
fresh
zesty
profile
and
a
super
easy
drinkibility
to
it
this
one
was
a
great
choice
for
the
tallboy
cans
as
its
prefect
for
summer
imbibing
i
had
this
on
tap
at
half
acre
the
beer
pours
a
light
murky
gold
with
a
decent
white
head
nothing
of
note
the
aroma
is
light
hops
pretty
boring
the
taste
is
bad
its
a
trumped
of
version
of
a
bud
light
light
hop
mostly
skunk
and
a
super
light
feel
mouthfeel
is
water
and
not
something
i
would
drink
more
than
half
a
pint
of
quite
disappointing
this
is
not
a
standout
beer
by
any
means
but
is
a
great
candidate
for
the
cooler
in
the
summer
easy
on
the
alcohol
and
somewhat
easy
on
the
wallet
in
craft
standards
full
flavored
enough
while
still
being
incredibly
easy
to
drink
and
refreshing
this
is
a
great
summer
beer
that
will
probably
see
a
lot
of
cooler
time
from
me
this
summer
whether
it
be
concert
tailgating
golfing
fishing
or
chilling
on
the
lake
cans
are
the
way
to
go
for
the
summer
as
for
drinkability
halfacres
version
of
a
session
ale
truly
hits
the
mark
it
practically
begs
to
be
quaffed
while
relaxing
on
a
porch
no
other
location
would
do
it
justice
drinkability
is
immense
not
since
surly
has
a
beer
in
a
can
been
so
good
to
me
thanks
again
freddy
never
heard
of
this
beer
before
you
and
i
definitely
seek
it
out
next
time
im
up
in
the
chi
d
ive
had
the
pleasure
of
enjoying
this
on
draft
from
a
growler
and
now
from
a
can
i
can
say
that
as
soon
as
it
is
readily
available
around
town
in
cans
this
will
be
my
go
to
summer
session
ale
this
is
a
wonderful
easy
to
drink
and
flavorful
blonde
ale
great
work
guys
a
freebie
to
take
home
from
dld
i
think
this
can
was
from
masterski
the
beer
pours
a
pale
orange
color
slightly
hazed
with
a
few
fingers
of
yeastcakelooking
foam
the
beer
smells
like
a
straightforward
ale
clean
with
hops
presenting
as
a
bitter
note
rather
than
floral
or
citrus
the
taste
is
likewise
straightforward
grainy
and
toasty
again
the
bitterness
in
the
aftertaste
but
not
as
strong
as
in
the
aroma
light
bodied
and
easy
to
pound
with
the
low
abv
id
call
this
a
perfect
summertime
beer
not
the
most
flavorful
from
half
acre
but
thats
not
what
they
were
shooting
for
d
id
drink
this
as
a
session
beer
any
day
its
not
the
most
complex
beer
but
its
got
a
solid
flavor
that
stays
stable
and
refreshing
until
the
end
i
was
pleasantly
surprised
when
i
remembered
i
hadnt
poured
the
entire
can
and
that
it
survived
warming
up
handily
d
if
the
aftertaste
werent
as
offputting
id
gladly
put
down
a
4pack
in
an
hour
or
two
this
would
be
perfect
in
the
wrigley
bleachers
as
everything
about
it
screams
session
love
the
16oz
tallboy
cans
and
the
animalfriendly
holders
too
a
great
drinker
and
fairly
impressive
given
the
low
abv
i
wish
the
flavor
had
lived
up
to
the
smell
but
then
it
probably
wouldnt
be
as
great
of
a
session
beer
edit
just
got
a
lowfill
can
at
the
brewery
super
fresh
there
was
a
clear
grassy
hop
note
to
the
aroma
and
a
nice
creamy
feel
also
seems
like
they
are
hitting
their
stride
with
this
one
great
summer
session
beer
d
highly
drinkable
im
not
a
big
fan
of
this
style
of
beer
but
it
is
a
pretty
good
take
on
it
and
easy
to
get
down
light
bodied
and
fairly
crisp
not
too
thin
not
too
full
refreshing
something
weird
was
in
the
aroma
hiding
underneath
the
hay
and
grassy
hops
i
couldnt
quite
figure
it
out
and
it
wasnt
appealing
at
first
but
then
the
taste
revealed
it
pretty
distinctly
sourdough
bread
contributing
a
little
tanginess
crackers
and
a
little
lemon
rind
really
pleasant
once
i
figured
that
out
some
grassy
hops
in
the
finish
and
just
supremely
drinkable
it
really
grew
on
me
as
i
kept
refilling
my
glass
i
could
drink
this
all
day
extremely
flavorful
and
palatable
for
a
beer
of
such
small
stature
impressive
the
mouthfeel
is
very
dry
and
light
without
being
lifeless
the
carbonation
is
at
a
high
refreshing
level
im
glad
i
got
to
drink
a
low
abv
beer
that
wasnt
boring
even
in
between
all
the
big
stuff
we
were
pouring
this
night
i
would
kill
this
growler
no
problem
on
my
own
this
was
a
good
american
style
session
beer
or
imperial
session
for
the
english
blokes
notes
this
beer
is
probably
too
hoppy
to
be
considered
a
bitter
or
mild
so
i
guess
the
brewery
defined
it
as
a
session
ale
i
see
its
listed
as
an
american
blonde
here
instead
of
any
of
those
i
just
hope
they
brew
more
in
the
warmer
months
we
need
more
flavorful
low
alcohol
beers
libation
what
can
i
say
this
is
an
excellent
ale
it
has
all
the
characteristics
of
what
id
want
a
great
sessionable
lager
to
be
clean
drinkable
and
a
complex
flavor
profile
that
does
not
try
to
assault
the
palate
its
unfortunate
that
so
little
of
this
was
produced
it
would
be
nice
to
see
half
acre
offer
this
one
again
lets
hope
they
do
great
beer
pours
a
bright
golden
hue
thick
rocky
white
head
intensely
and
pleasantly
dryhopped
not
overwhelming
very
little
malt
in
the
aroma
mouthfeel
is
fresh
satisfying
and
fufilling
but
not
heavy
or
crisp
just
right
this
beer
has
some
legs
to
it
very
enjoyable
hops
stay
with
you
throughout
fruity
citrusy
not
dry
great
beer
not
surprising
from
the
guys
at
half
acre
theyre
off
to
a
great
start
cheers
pours
a
clear
golden
orange
with
a
foamy
beige
head
that
settles
to
a
film
on
top
of
the
beer
small
streaks
of
lace
form
around
the
glass
on
the
drink
down
smell
is
of
malt
grain
grass
and
hay
taste
is
much
the
same
with
a
sweet
and
slightly
fruity
finish
there
is
a
very
mild
bitterness
on
the
palate
with
each
sip
this
beer
has
a
lower
level
of
carbonation
with
a
slightly
crisp
mouthfeel
overall
this
is
a
pretty
good
beer
that
is
drinkable
and
pretty
tasty
for
what
it
is
ive
passed
this
one
so
many
times
thankfully
a
single
made
itself
available
recently
so
i
finally
decided
to
give
it
a
shot
it
pours
a
clear
brass
topped
by
a
finger
of
shortlived
offwhite
foam
the
nose
is
a
blast
of
buttery
biscuit
with
little
else
getting
in
the
way
the
taste
changes
things
up
a
bit
thankfully
with
notes
of
orange
zest
light
lemon
peel
caramel
and
light
buttery
toffee
coming
through
the
body
is
a
hefty
light
with
a
light
moderate
carbonation
and
a
fairly
dry
finish
overall
nothing
too
interesting
going
on
here
but
nothing
all
that
offensive
either
just
another
blah
beer
thats
gonna
be
passed
over
by
me
in
the
future
a
decent
blonde
it
pours
a
pretty
golden
color
with
a
small
white
head
and
just
a
bit
of
hoppiness
and
some
mild
bitter
notes
not
a
bad
beer
but
not
my
favorite
from
redhook
i
would
maybe
drink
it
again
but
overall
i
was
not
especially
impressed
overall
it
was
a
little
bitter
to
be
a
real
sessionable
ale
and
is
honestly
a
bit
forgettable
nothing
really
standing
up
and
greabbing
you
about
this
one
a
decent
pale
ale
that
doesnt
really
stand
out
in
the
crowd
during
a
visit
to
portsmouth
we
took
the
opportunity
to
visit
redhook
brewery
tried
the
golden
blonde
the
color
was
golden
clear
with
nice
carbonation
that
gave
way
to
a
thin
white
head
and
lacing
the
nose
was
a
very
faint
citrus
if
any
the
taste
was
good
nice
crisp
clean
with
maybe
a
hint
of
lemon
the
mouthfeel
was
good
and
i
certainly
could
do
a
session
with
this
beer
very
drinkable
welcome
back
hm
well
for
starters
on
appearance
it
looks
almost
completely
see
through
i
am
very
surprised
at
how
clear
it
is
it
looks
like
a
lager
almost
to
me
i
know
its
a
blonde
ale
but
still
there
is
a
lot
of
carbonation
the
head
looked
nice
when
i
first
poured
it
it
almost
looked
creamy
with
a
one
finger
width
but
now
its
almost
gone
the
appearance
is
average
the
first
smell
i
get
is
the
hops
which
is
good
it
means
its
not
pussing
out
the
hop
aspect
the
next
smell
i
pick
up
is
citrus
and
finally
a
small
malt
sweetness
in
the
very
back
the
smell
its
amazing
but
it
smells
pretty
good
well
the
taste
is
a
little
disappointing
instead
of
getting
that
hop
bite
at
first
you
get
the
malts
instead
there
is
a
small
hop
bite
mixed
in
there
pretty
nicely
but
it
is
subdued
by
the
overall
sweetness
and
maltyness
of
the
beer
there
might
be
a
tiny
tiny
citrus
but
nothing
like
what
i
was
smelling
which
is
also
disappointing
all
in
all
the
beer
tastes
a
little
bit
watered
down
to
me
with
all
that
being
said
it
isnt
a
bad
tasting
beer
its
good
just
very
average
an
average
beer
from
what
i
can
tell
is
a
so
far
average
brewery
as
far
as
mouthfeel
and
drinkability
go
the
mouthfeel
is
ok
nothing
special
the
drinkability
is
pretty
good
since
it
is
watered
down
a
bit
and
the
taste
is
easy
drinking
and
its
yummy
enough
not
to
be
a
gross
watery
beer
overall
an
average
beer
the
body
was
a
bit
thin
for
the
style
yet
managed
to
still
be
kinda
sticky
drinkability
was
decent
but
below
average
for
the
style
overall
if
youre
in
the
mood
for
this
style
try
a
different
example
86th
despite
the
overall
presentation
its
a
refreshing
though
not
completely
satisfying
beer
ok
blond
fairly
one
noted
with
the
exception
of
a
nice
clean
honey
taste
ive
alway
found
redhook
to
be
a
solid
if
unspectacular
brewery
and
this
offering
is
no
different
worth
a
try
though
redhook
blonde
is
an
average
blonde
ale
that
is
a
little
lighter
on
flavor
than
i
hoped
d
very
drinkable
probably
goes
well
with
just
about
any
meal
or
salad
refreshing
and
not
boring
for
a
blonde
in
this
category
sessionable
ver
drinkable
even
for
the
non
beer
drinker
like
my
sister
sampled
on
september
30
2010
it
pours
a
slightly
cloudy
golden
yellow
with
a
quarter
to
half
inch
of
fizzy
white
head
hops
seem
to
greet
the
nose
at
first
but
that
is
followed
up
by
a
vaguely
yeasty
slightly
malty
sensation
the
taste
has
this
sort
of
canteloupe
or
melon
thing
going
on
as
well
as
a
thin
but
tart
hoppiness
in
the
end
a
good
choice
if
youre
looking
to
drink
more
than
one
or
two
by
the
same
token
though
there
are
a
number
of
other
beers
out
there
that
taste
pretty
similar
if
you
find
yourself
in
possession
of
a
couple
theyll
go
down
smooth
but
i
wouldnt
go
looking
for
it
i
rank
this
as
a
session
beer
or
a
good
beer
for
drinking
with
food
its
definitely
a
beer
that
invites
a
second
half
or
even
more
drinkability
the
bit
of
sourness
in
the
taste
is
fleeting
and
doesnt
build
on
the
palate
overall
an
enjoyable
and
refreshing
beer
highly
drinkable
but
just
not
as
tasty
as
i
had
hoped
it
would
be
after
the
initial
flavor
burst
up
front
all
in
all
a
good
beer
just
leaning
towards
the
basic
side
which
i
guess
is
fine
for
a
nice
summer
brew
a
definite
session
beer
taste
middle
of
the
road
minimal
hopping
but
a
tang
that
faint
sweetness
again
very
little
malt
heft
but
enough
to
separate
it
from
a
lesser
classification
this
is
a
decently
built
beer
for
a
summer
day
or
girlfriend
good
enough
for
me
around
the
pool
decent
enough
mouthfeel
a
beer
to
drink
after
youve
mowed
the
lawn
and
you
want
something
to
drink
d
very
drinkable
a
good

damn
did

use

overall
a
decent
crisp
ale
that
is
refreshing
nothing
too
special
or
interesting
here
at
all
though
i
wouldnt
turn
one
but
i
dont
see
myself
seeking
this
one
out
again
the
case
packaging
looks
neat
as
well
pass
on
this
one
blondes
are
not
my
favorite
beer
but
this
is
one
thats
worth
getting
if
thats
what
youre
looking
for
not
going
to
be
too
expensive
hopefully
your
expectations
are
already
depressed
and
its
really
not
that
bad
after
all
that
decent
sweetness
which
a
blond
should
have
and
good
enough
abv
to
put
on
a
buzz
with
some
nice
body
in
this
ale
more
than
expected
really
a
fair
amount
of
carbonation
but
still
a
nice
smooth
mouthfeel
very
drinkable
beer
not
heavy
or
filling
and
great
flavor
i
could
do
this
whole
six
pack
no
problem
low
intensity
high
refreshment
and
unexpected
character
d
would
not
recommend
this
one
but
it
is
drinkable
not
a
stellar
example
of
a
blonde
ale
at
all
overall
this
is
nothing
special
it
doesnt
have
to
much
of
a
complex
taste
to
it
no
major
malts
or
major
hops
maybe
a
good
summer
beer
d
this
brew
lacks
in
overall
complexity
and
has
that
as
i
saw
on
another
post
lawnmower
type
of
vibe
on
a
hot
day
this
might
turn
out
to
be
the
cats
meow
otherwise
it
misses
the
mark
it
felt
watery
yet
syrupy
at
the
same
end
that
said
it
was
drinkable
and
not
terrible
pours
a
body
that
is
clear
yellow
in
color
with
a
frothy
head
small
malty
and
effervescent
light
watery
malty
taste
light
similar
in
many
aspects
to
big
brother
beer
not
much
else
to
say
kinda
bland
m
d
moderate
carbonation
and
a
lighter
body
its
a
pleasant
beer
without
going
too
crazy
in
any
way
just
nice
and
simple
if
some
of
the
macro
offerings
were
more
like
this
id
be
in
beer
heaven
not
too
bad
at
all
overall
the
beer
is
just
okay
i
dont
think
it
is
great
there
is
a
cooked
corn
note
coming
over
the
toasted
malt
the
mouth
feel
is
carbonation
and
powdery
finish
is
slight
bit
bitter
and
it
kinda
leaves
a
funky
aftertaste
a
solid
yet
average
brew
doesnt
blow
you
away
with
its
boldness
but
thats
not
the
brews
purpose
the
brews
purpose
is
to
be
a
solid
blonde
ale
considering
the
limitations
of
the
style
i
would
consider
this
a
very
average
blonde
ale
not
something
i
will
seek
out
again
but
i
wouldnt
turn
one
down
either
fairly
drinkable
like
the
rest
of
the
style
a
clear
pale
golden
color
with
a
minimal
white

no

clear

and
little
sweet
and
lemony
kind
of
like
a
hefelight
a
good
beer
for
a
hot
day
but
nothing
spectacular
a
better
alternative
to
bud
light
d
very
dribkable
and
non
offensive
not
amazing
but
it
gets
good
marks
becaue
it
is
quite
nice
in
the
style
the
beer
is
a
good
looking
one
with
a
nice
pale
malt
nose
with
some
graininess
underneath
the
beer
pours
a
clear
golden
a
few
shades
darker
than
pale
with
a
decent
creamy
white
head
and
some
lacing
the
beer
is
light
to
medium
bodied
and
a
little
thicker
and
creamier
than
what
is
typical
in
the
style
there
is
a
hoppy
presence
right
up
front
in
this
beer
and
a
rather
citrusy
rind
taste
more
on
the
back
end
this
isnt
a
particularly
complex
blonde
ale
it
is
smooth
quite
a
bit
sweeter
than
most
other
blondes
with
some
graininess
and
biscuity
qualities
lurking
not
too
far
below
this
is
definitely
more
chewy
than
what
is
typical
for
the
style
there
is
just
a
slightly
off
lemony
citrus
taste
and
a
bit
too
much
hop
up
front
that
detracts
from
this
beer
the
beer
is
moderately
carbonated
and
has
an
aftertaste
that
does
linger
a
bit
not
a
bad
beer
glad
i
gave
it
a
try
drinkability
this
beer
has
a
warm
toasty
feeling
to
it
and
its
ok
for
a
sipper
personally
i
dont
really
care
for
beer
when
it
gets
warmer
but
i
feel
that
this
one
holds
up
better
that
way
i
wouldnt
buy
this
on
a
regular
basis
but
its
not
something
that
id
avoid
either
not
bad
but
definately
not
the
best
redhook
has
to
offer
nothing
out
of
the
ordinary
here
just
the
usual
blonde
ale
that
seems
to
be
pushed
out
by
all
american
breweries
it
was
thrown
in
the
mixed
12
pack
so
i
gave
it
a
whirl
but
wasnt
really
too
happy
with
it
its
light
bodied
and
super
drinkable
but
just
not
enough
taste
to
warrant
buying
this
on
its
own
an
easy
drinker
but
otherwise
unimpressive
not
bad
nothing
to
write
home
about
either
d
a
fairly
new
style
i
would
say
this
is
an
unremarkable
beverage
but
compared
to
some
of
its
contemporaries
its
above
decent
d
very
drinkable
beer
as
it
is
not
very
overpowering
in
any
of
the
flavors
and
is
a
light
feeling
beer
perfect
for
a
summer
day
light
and
fairly
refreshing
golden
color
topped
with
a
thin
white
head
pretty
basic
taste
with
a
slight
malt
flavor
with
some
citric
wheaty
lemon
notes
goes
down
pretty
smooth
but
this
is
nothing
special
it
would
be
good
for
sitting
in
the
hot
sun
or
doing
some
yard
work
the
drinkability
is
ok
but
i
would
not
recommend
or
choose
it
again
prosit
mk
d
this
beer
is
nothing
special
but
i
dont
always
need
an
outstanding
and
complex
beer
this
is
a
drinkable
smooth
ale
and
a
very
good
summer
drink
for
a
blonde
its
not
extreme
but
its
sessionable
and
can
hold
its
own
in
the
summertime
i
wouldnt
want
to
go
after
this
one
during
the
fall
and
winter
months
but
it
fits
with
the
mixed
12pack
it
came
with
there
are
so
many
better
blonde
ales
out
there
that
i
regret
buying
a
six
pack
of
this
stuff
and
will
probably
give
it
to
guests
to
try
except
for
the
weak
aroma
i
kinda
dug
this
brew
d
wouldnt
mind
having
a
few
of
these
to
pound
certainly
better
than
macro
alternatives
but
overall
its
a
very
bland
brew
it
somewhat
reminds
me
of
flying
dogs
tire
bite
mixed
with
semiflat
seltzer
pours
a
clear
med
gold
w
a
thin
white
head
which
dissipates
quickly
leaving
little
to
no
lacing
in
my
nonic
a
very
subtle
smell
a
bit
of
steely
grain
and
lightly
toasted
malts
but
not
much
else
a
thin
dry
flavor
as
well
a
bit
of
bready
malts
and
a
slight
hop
bite
some
fruits
but
not
discernable
slightly
metallic
finish
a
dry
light
bodied
beer
with
a
good
amount
of
co2
a
quaffable
brew
for
sure
just
not
a
striking
one
d
lets
be
honest
this
isnt
going
to
have
as
much
impact
as
a
great
ipa
or
tripel
but
as
a
blonde
ale
its
quite
good

poured
into
a
pint
glass
pours
a
slightly
hazy
golden
yellow
color
with
a
thin
white
head
the
aroma
is
sweet
grainy
malt
with
just
a
touch
of
hops
the
taste
mirrors
the
smell
with
some
malt
and
a
touch
of
hops
in
the
finish
this
is
really
not
an
overly
complex
beer
but
is
decent
for
what
it
is
all
in
all
this
is
an
easy
drinking
blonde
that
just
doesnt
possess
enough
character
to
buy
again
this
poured
a
light
clear
amber
with
very
little
head
it
smelled
and
tasted
like
a
regular
pale
ale
with
a
bit
of
hops
and
descent
malt
flavoring
it
was
watery
but
somewhat
smooth
with
almost
no
carbonation
it
had
only
a
little
aftertaste
which
made
it
easy
to
drink
but
not
very
potent
overall
mediocre
verdict
not
bad
drinkable
sessionable
impressive
not
so
much
good
summer
beer
check
the
flavor
doesnt
really
live
up
to
a
great
ale
but
its
drinkable

cloudy
orange

yellow
with
a
bare
head
that
quickly
dissipates
to
nothing

tracing
to
speak
of
aromas
are
a
play
on
some
crystal
malts
and
hops
mostly
citrus
varieties
with
some
bright
fruitiness
as
well
it
is
a
very
quiet
aroma
clean
on
the
palate
the
malts
develop
with
biscuity
notes
whole
grain
bread
and
then
mashed
with
more
oranges
and
lemons
almost
to
a
slight
tartness
hops
are
very
subdued
an
overall
so
so
beer
certainly
an
easy
drinker
and
nothing
offensive
but
not
particularly
one
i
would
pick
up
again
pours
a
strawish
blonde
yellow
color
with
a
fair
white
head
lots
of
bubbles
smell
is
of
light
graininess
maybe
a
hint
of
fruitiness
taste
is
more
of
the
very
light
matlygrainy
flavors
with
a
slight
noble
hoplike
bitterness
balanced
but
yet
not
much
character
to
speak
of
easy

carbonated

fairly
drinkable
if
you
are
looking
for
something
light
pours
a
light
orangegold
with
a
thin
white
head
that
shrinks
to
a
ring
forthwith
the
nose
is
mostly
citrus
and
tepid
malty
sweetness
as
is
the
taste
rather
bland
and
uncomplicated
while
remaining
inoffensive
crisp
lightbodied
mouthfeel
an
easy
drinker
but
not
a
thrilling
one
mediocre
across
the
board
just
wanted
something
a
little
lighter
while
im
making
the
chili
before
the
big
super
bowl
feast
and
i
pulled
this
out
of
the
redhook
variety
pack
so
as
not
to
take
any
of
the
better
offerings
ahead
of
time
it
served
its
purpose
id
never
buy
one
on
its
own
taste
is
malty
up
front
not
too
sweet
bitterness
near
the
end
but
neither
aspect
are
particular
strong
nor
noteworthy
crisp
taste
bit
much
carbonation
better
if
this
was
a

seasonal
than
a

brew
that
could

winter

typical
of
most
of
them
lighlty
hoppy
smooth
not
much
body
character
or
love
in
this
one
a
drinkable
beer
but
not
one
i
would
have
over
and
over
again
this
would
be
a
great
hot
summer
lawnmower
type
beer
ill
definitely
consider
it
again
when
im
looking
for
that
frisbeevolleyball
summer
beer
overall
not
much
bad
to
say
about
the
taste
that
is
present
rather
theres
a
lot
of
taste
that
is
lacking
a
goldenyellow
with
decent
head
retention
some
lacing
s
some
lighter
malts
a
distant
hop
aroma
nothing
huge
t
huge
presence
of
strawberries
maybe
it
was
just
this
cask
but
im
having
hard
differentiating
anything
else
theres
a
slightly
hop
dry
finish
but
not
much
to
speak
of
m
coarse
light
refreshing
d
the
balance
is
a
bit
off
the
fruit
taste
is
a
bit
overpowering
but
overall
its
a
nice
light
beer
for
a
hot
day
gapit
drinkability
all
day
if
necessary
with
no
regrets
this
is
pretty
drinkable
definitely
sessionableif
you
like
the
style
this
came
in
a
variety
12
pack
and
it
was
okay
i
guess
but
to
purchase
this
on
its
own
not
drinkability
easy
drinking
session
ale
d
pretty
high
for
me
this
is
a
refreshing
beer
that
is
very
easy
to
down
not
too
complex
but
a
good
beer
nonetheless
try
this
beer
if
you
like
redhook
not
great
not
bad
a
good
enough
blonde
my
only
issue
was
what
i
said
above
tasty
clean
flavor
with
a
fresh
accent
and
smooth
easy
finish
not
much
more
than
crystal
malts
and
medium
nobles
but
it
works
especally
in
warm
weather
it
was
83
degrees
yesterday
in
the
middle
of
october
high
drinkability
good
for
the
style
have
this
brew
left
over
from
the
summer
in
my
opinion
on
a
warm
day
this
brew
is
pretty
tasty
and
refreshing
the
brew
pours
to
a
golden
color
that
is
pretty
vibrant
has
a
nice
sized
white
head
that
seems
to
break
down
quite
quickly
but
did
leave
a
little
lacing
at
the
top
of
the
glass
the
aroma
that
comes
to
mind
quickly
is
sweet
but
not
in
a
way
that
is
overpowering
but
dominant
and
i
would
imagine
this
is
from
the
malts
as
well
as
having
a
slight
fruit
like
ester
to
it
all
in
all
it
is
a
lighter
brew
and
the
aromas
seem
to
fit
the
bill
the
taste
is
similar
to
the
aroma
nothing
really
new
here
but
does
have
a
slight
doughbread
flavoring
this
is
a
light
please
do
not
confuse
my
portrayal
of
light
as
equaling
most
mass
produced
light
beers
beer
that
is
very
refreshing
easy
to
drink
on
warmer
days
i
am
glad
to
have
this
one
in
the
summer
pack
but
would
be
a
little
upset
if
this
was
in
the
winter
pack
offering
pours
a
lager
like
golden
light
color
with
a
small
white
head
a
decent
amount
of
head
smells
slightly
citrusy
it
does
have
some
great
hoppiness
to
it
taste
is
like
a
lager
and
an
ale
got
it
on
and
made
a
pretty
decent
beer
has
a
nice
slight
maltiness
to
it
but
also
a
laggery
type
hopness
not
a
bad
beer
redhook
makes
some
good
affordable
beers
and
this
one
is
no
exception
medium
gold
color
decent
white
head
that
fizzes
out
somewhat
quickly
smells
like
a
beer
thats
not
trying
to
be
something
other
than
a
beer
no
stupid
fruity
odors
no
excessive
hoppyness
just
a
pleasant
somewhat
sweet
aroma
if
this
beer
was
a
breakfast
cereal
it
would
be
golden
grahams
nice
amount
of
carbonation
and
texture
this
is
a
quite
drinkable
brew
i
like
it
drinkability
blah
this
beer
is
hardly
worth
even
trying
there
are
no
outstanding
characteristics
to
speak
of
and
its
affiliated
with
bud
stop
trying
to
pass
this
off
as
a
microbrew
k
thx
bye
when
poured
the
color
was
a
medium
dark
yellow
with
very
little
foam
and
no
lace
what
so
ever
the
smell
of
hops
and
spice
was
evident
in
the
aroma
coming
out
of
the
glass
the
taste
of
hops
had
a
weak
flavor
and
the
spice
tasted
like
corriander
that
was
weak
not
well
balanced
and
the
flavor
was
boring
boring
boring
served
with
nearly
no
head
in
a
32
oz
glass
mug
pale
yellow
in
color
and
nearly
clear
very
little
aroma
taste
is
light
with
just
a
hint
of
hops
slight
wheat
flavor
not
bad
for
a
lawnmower
beer
poured
a
hazy
golden
color
with
very
little
head
that
dissipated
rather
quickly
not
much
aroma
to
speak
of
at
all
thin
body
with
watery
mouthfeel
fairly
pedestrian
blonde
ale
that
neither
offends
nor
really
satisfies
unfortunately
much
better
than
a
macrobrew
but
what
isnt
bland
nothing
too
remarkable
about
this
beer
either
but
it
certainly
has
enough
flavor
to
make
it
onto
my
list
again
nothing
stands
out
as
bad
either
a
good
macro
all
around
but
nothing
fantastic
overall
theres
really
not
much
to
say
this
beer
doesnt
really
have
any
downsides
other
than
a
lack
of
upsides
i
certainly
wouldnt
turn
a
bottle
of
this
down
as
its
fairly
refreshing
but
there
isnt
anything
which
would
make
me
seek
it
out
overall
i
had
to
take
a
step
back
when
reviewing
this
beer
i
wasnt
prepared
for
something
so
light
going
in
however
it
was
actually
quite
good
considering
the
style
it
isnt
something
i
would
seek
out
but
the
next
time
im
in
the
mood
for
something
on
the
lighter
side
it
is
something
i
would
consider
smells
of
a
light
sweet
malt
and
fruitiness
a
little
diacetyl
and
hop
pours
medium
straw

clear

mild

is
creamy
tastes
crisp
with

sweetness
fruitiness




low


pretty
light
and
watery

overall
impression
light

easytodrink
beer
good
for
thirsty
summer
afternoons
doesnt
taste
like
much
but
i
suppose
its
not
supposed
to
redhook

what
they
advertised

american

not

redhook
blonde
ale
was
a
golden
color
with
good
clarity
it
had
an
offwhite
head
with
decent
retention
and
left
a
little
lacing
behind
the
aroma
was
sweet
malt
with
a
touch
of
hops
the
taste
was
sweet

with
some

thrown
in
the

overall
a

dnice
summer
beer
not
one
to
drink
to
fast
or
too
slow
drinkability
another
middle
of
the
road
offering
from
redhook
which
i
think
would
be
great
for
the
noncraft
beer
drinker
and
also
occasionally
for
the
craft
beer
drinker
who
is
looking
for
something
basic
or
for
a
change
of
pace
appearance
is
golden
in
color
with
a
white
head
that
disapates
quickly
smell
and
taste
pretty
much
the
same
of
sweet
malt
with
a
good
crispness
to
it
with
a
healthly
carbonation
having
a
light
mouthfeel
this
is
a
simple
ale
and
a
good
choice
for
the
warmer
months
when
looking
for
something
refreshing
surprisingly
good
for
a
redhhook
tho
i
like
the
esb
and
porter
too
the
word
blonde
doesnt
quite
get
it
maybe
golden
amber
hue
as
this
describes
the
color
of
th
body
much
better
with
a
light
tan
head
that
doesnt
stay
around
long
very
zesty
mineral
induced
nose
but
not
special
enters
the
mouth
sharply
with
a
slightly
soured
silky
mineral
feel
nuttines
is
also
present
mouthfeel
is
oddly
thick
for
this
type
of
beer
but
nicely
welecome
fineshes
with
a
slight
wheat
bitter
overall
enjoyable
drinkability
its
harmlessness
is
offset
by
its
relative
vacuousness
im
not
sure
i
could
describe
this
beer
to
you
tomorrow
its
so
nondescript
drinkability
is
only
slighty
inhibitied
by
the
over
sweetness
oh
well
im
rating
it
as
a
tasty
blonde
ale
cheers
notes
red
hook
could
do
better
a
disappointing
effort
peace
bc
dirty
blonde
color
minimal
head
but
some
nice
retention
light
body
some
grain
and
faint
wheat
fllavors
solidly
malty
but
enough
hops
for
a
crisp
dry
finish
simple
and
highly
drinkable
easy
finish
a
little
boring
but
that
might
be
what
you
are
looking
for
the
malts
are
a
bit
more
assertive
when
tasted
as
they
come
across
ascaramel
and
toast
just
enough
hop
dryness
for
balance
and
a
clean
finish
the
butter
is
gone
the
mouth
is
light
and
spritzy
this
would
make
for
a
decent
hot
weather
beer
overall
a
good
nobrainer
beer
with
some
easily
accessible
taste
its
crisp
and
refreshing
so
if
i
ever
have
to
settle
for
it
again
on
a
hot
day
i
wont
be
disappointed
its
just
too
sweet
and
kind
of
bland
theres
not
much
complexity
in
this
one
the
esb
is
still
my
preferred

fine

d
this
beer
his
light
and
crisp
and

many
lager
qualities
but
it
doesnt
have
the
nice
depth
of

nothing

quite
drinkable

yes
a
simple
golden
blond
ale
not
something
id
normally
go
after
but
on
a
warm
summer
day
or
just
hanging
out
watching
the
game
a
great
session
beer
pours
a
clear
yellowish
gold
with
a
small
head
starting
out
fading
to
nothing
little
lacing
to
speak
of
faint
aroma
cant
even
pick
up
enough
to
tell
what
it
is
a
light
body
makes
this
easy
to
drink
but
there
really
isnt
much
to
taste
little
malt
presense
hop
unnoticable
better
than
piss
beer
to
be
sure
but
still
no
reason
to
have
this
again
would
be
a
good
one
for
doing
something
on
a
hot
afternoon
md
it
has
a
mediumlight
body
with
almost
high
carbonation
pretty
much
what
i
was
expecting
easy
drinking
sessionable
and
refreshing
i
could
see
myself
enjoying
these
from
an
ice
bucket
while
on
the
beach
on
a
nice
summer
day

good
solid
choice
amongst
beers
to
relax
with

pale

minimal
with
a

bready

taste
porsents
more

and
is
fairly
pleasant
finishes
with
more
dryness
than
maltiness
and
is
enjoyable
a
nice
easy
drinking
beer
but
nothing
exceptional
a
nice
drinkable
ale
would
be
a
nice
first
ale
for
lager
drinkers
overall
impression
pretty
basic
beer
but
this
one
is
very
drinkable
probably
a
good
crossover
beer
for
your
macro
friends
malty
beers
like
this
seem
to
coat
my
mouth
and
this
one
does
the
same
a
little
hop
dryness
in
the
aftertaste
easy
to
drink
at
first
i
didnt
know
what
i
was
drinking
so
it
was
a
guessing
game
i
figured
it
was
something
light
and
guessed
a
summer
beer
when
i
finally
looked
at
the
keg
i
realized
that
i
was
essentially
right
redhook
blonde
is
not
the
most
flavorful
beer
but
what
is
there
is
very
pleasant
there
is
a
slight
wheat
taste
with
a
hint
of
lemon
that
makes
it
a
very
drinkable
beer
to
have
several
of
the
freshness
of
the
keg
was
a
big
positive
for
this
beer
was
crisp
and
enjoyable
i
can
picture
myself
sitting
outside
during
the
disgustingly
humid
months
of
boston
drinking
one
after
an
another
overall
unremarkable
not
really
sure

this
one
is

well
for
me
on
this
one
mouthfeel
is
light
with
a
light
to
moderate
carbonation
id
like
a
much
healthier
carbonation
to
keep
this
one
from
just
feeling
flat
overall
drinkability
is
just
okay
on
this
one
the
flavors
seem
to
be
fighting
each
other
with
the
doughyness
and
the
noble
hop
just
not
blending
well
the
feel
seems
off
with
the
carbonation
not
balancing
this
is
one
i
dont
see
in
my
future
this
beer
pours
a
golden
yellow
with
a
thin
white
head
that
leaves
a
little
film
and
a
little

the
smell
is
a
sweet

smell
the
taste
is
mild
barley
malts
with
somewhat
of
a
buttery
aftertaste
good
carbonation

the
thickness
is

a

i
wouldnt

picking
it

a

overall
impression

drinkability
is
dangerous
it
seems
to
have
less
alcohol
than
it
does
dnot
much
flavor
but
could
be
very
good
after
working
in
the
yard
this
might
be
a
good
transition
beer
for
those
who
are
just
starting
the
craft
journey
there
are
some
macro
pilsner
similarities
but
just
enough
hints
to
craft
to
possibly
seduce
someone
to
the
dark
side
this
newly
redesigned
bottle
of
redhook
blonde
might
as
well
be
any
basic
macro
in
my
opinion
same
color
taste
etc
pours
a
fizzy
yellow
with
a
faint
hint
of
fruity
ale
sweetness
but
that
seems
to
be
the
only
distinguishing
ale
feature
of
this
beer
bland
boring
macro
taste
with
no
hop
profile
to
speak
of
so
many
other
fine
ales
to
choose
at
this
price
that
redhook
beers
arent
worth
the
time
too
bad
this
is
a
very
drinkable
beer
it
would
be
particularly
good
on
a
hot
summer
day
maybe
even
garnished
with
a
small
slice
of
lemon
drinkability
here
reflects
taste
i
wouldnt
turn
this
down
at
a
party
not
a
bad
beer
at
all
my
friend
who
normally
does
not
like
beer
was
estatic
about
this
one
this
is
a
good
cross
over
beer
give
it
a
try
in
summary
i
think
that
redhook
blonde
ale
is
an
above
average
beer
product
i
think
it
will
appeal
to
most
drinkers
at
least
as
an
occasional
summertime
quaff
its
nothing
exceptional
but
its
good
enough
to
throw
back
a
few
on
a
warm
day
to
quench
your
thirst
while
you
anticipate
something
a
little
better

i
really
wonder
how

this

if
they
didnt

ab
was

if
one
reviews
this
beer
objectively
and
according
to
style
you
should
find
it
pretty
good
its
a
blonde

and
well
made
i
would
have
this
again
if
offered
the

pretty
good
id
have
another

this
is
my
last
blonde
ale
from
a

case
not
my
favorite
kind
of
beer

this
does
its
business
well
and
i

it
is
enjoyed
by
those
kind
of
people
who
enjoy
this
kind
of
beer
this
brew
pours
a
clear
golden

with
a
small

the
recedes
within
seconds
the
aroma

thin

malty
the
taste
is
almost
as
thin
as
the
smell
but
not
quite
there
is
a
faint

flavor
but
nothing
else
the
mouthfeel
is
light

and
over
carbonated
the
carbonation
actually
burns
my
tongue
as
i
drink
overall
this
beer
just
isnt
my
thing
it
might
be
appealing
to
the
average
macro
drinker
as
i
am
sure
it
is
meant
to
be
but
to
a
craft
beer
drinker
this
brew
doesnt
have
enough
of
all
things
that
make
beer
great

and

ill
have
this
again
next

when
the

starts
good
drinkability
the
beer
despite
its
simplicity
or
maybe
due
to
its
simplicity
was
very
drinkable
and
i
could
have
had
one
or
two
more
right
on
the
spot
part
of
that
is
that
i
kept
want
it
to
blossom
into
something
more
significant
on
my
palate
the
other
aspect
is
that
the
beer
is
consistent
from
start
to

this

there

out
there
i
dont

the
purchase
of
a
sixpack
since
i
and
my
friends
will
enjoy
every
one
o
overall
an

blonde
ale
too
sweetmalty
for
my
tastes
had
this
one
while
out
sightseeing
in
new

served
from
tap
into
an
abita
shaker
poured
golden
with
a
half
finger
white
head
that
subsided
to
a
minimal
amount
quickly
there
was
no
lacing
evident
throughout
the
glass
the
aroma
was
comprised
of
sweet
malt
earth
musty
skunk
wheat
and
grain
the
flavor
was
of
sweet
malt
grain
wheat
earth
and
metallic
it
had
a
light
feel
on
the
palate
with
mediumhigh
carbonation
overall
this
was
an
average
brew
unfortunately
nothing
on
this
one
really
stood
out
for
me
for
this
style
it
seemed
to
be
a
pretty
average
example
of
the
style
with
the
earthy
and
wheat
flavors
going
on
i
really
wish
it
could
have
had
a
just
a
little
more
going
on
to
make
my
palate
jump
up
and
down
with
joy
they
do
good
beers
but
this
isnt
one
of
my
favorites
o
my
score
is
significantly
higher
than
the
critical
mass
on
this
one
but
im
judging
nola
blonde
against
the
competition
of
lowabv
session
ales
and
this
is
as
good
as
it
gets
in
the
middletier
price
range
blows
the
doors
off
all
the
other
blah
southern
session
ales
comes
only
in
a
can
has
a
lot
of
flavor
and
wont
have
you
on
the
floor
if
you
happen
to
burn
through
a
bunch
nola
can
be
a
little
hit
or
miss
but
the
blonde
really
works

at

in

poured
golden
color
with
slight

very
mild
malty
macro
aroma
but
slight
crisp

taste
is
good
for
a
blonde
crisp
mild
slightly
sweet
citrus
its
ok
but
there
are
much
better
brews
out
there
but
yes
it
is
a
good
intro
to
craft
beer
but
there
is
about
a
billion
miles
between
this
and
something
like
a
firestone
walker
anniversary
brew
drink
it
was
tasty
probably
the
1st
blonde
ale
ive
really
enjoyed
would
have
this
one
again
on
a
hot
day
while
drinking
from
a
can
overall
not
a
bad
beer
just
a
bit
boring
overall
not
a
phenomenal
beer
but
pretty
good
for
its
style
very
drinkable
and
great
for
a
hot
night
sessionable
tasty
as
far
as
blonde
ales
cans
are
always
a
plus
in
a
style
where
the
top
rated
beer
rates
below
a
4
this
is
one
to
check
out
i
expect
this
to
rise
to
the
top
few
if
more
people
tick
it
with
an
open
mind
to
the
style
in
general
i
do
not
particularly
love
the
american
blonde
style
i
cannot
deny
this
that
being
said
this
is
pretty
remarkable
its
much
less
boring
than
i
anticipated
this
is
not
only
better
than
the
typical
blonde
ale
its
simply
a
good
beer
ive
never
been
a
huge
fan
of
american
blonde
ales
nola
brewing
company
has
done
a
nice
job
with
this
one
the
nice
fruit
and
hop
flavors
really
make
things
tick
its
not
very
deep
or
complex
but
it
is
tasty
nonetheless
as
far
as
american
blondes
go
its
a
pretty
good
option
check
it
out
pours
a
hazed
light
golden
yellow
good
cap
of
white
froth
okay
retention
scent
leads
with
a
blend
of
light
citrus
and
light
doughy
bread
not
much
else
taste
is
light
as
expected
light
fresh
citrus
and
a
splash
of
fruity
and
sweet
esters
some
faint
kisses
of
doughy
bread
again
medium
bodied
good
moderate
carbonation
nice
intro
to
the
brewery
and
one
that
i
would
love
to
share
with
some
craft
beer
noobs
m
lively
and
fruity
the
citrus
lasts
throughout
with
just
a
bit
of
hop
bitterness
nothing
fancy
but
a
good
tasting
ale
o
a
tasty
treat
indeed
a
friend
picked
it
up
for
me
from
new
orleans
and
while
i
was
a
little
disapointed
it
was
a
blonde
ale
it
was
free
a
snapshot
of
a
new
brewery
for
myself
as
well
as
a
damn
good
blonde
ale
i
really
wanna
see
what
else
these
guys
do
now
dammit
i
should
be
watching
the
saints
with
this
beer
rather
than
the
broncos
oh
well
i
guess
gods
in
there
somehow
either
way
right
it
pours
a
lightly
hazy
gold
topped
by
a
finger
of
offwhite
foam
the
nose
comprises
wheat
light
coriander
lemon
peel
and
a
sort
of
brettlike
funk
that
seems
rather
out
of
place
here
the
taste
brings
in
more
of
the
same
with
a
light
pinch
of
black
pepper
and
a
bit
more
lemon
zest
than
before
the
body
is
a
rather
light
medium
with
a
light
moderate
carbonation
and
a
sortakinda
grainy
feel
overall
a
morethanordinary
brew
one
im
glad
to
have
tried
for
the
sake
of
it
but
nothing
id
ever
really
look
to
have
again
o
this
is
an
easydrinking
lawnmower
ale
if
ive
ever
had
one
simple
yet
not
at
all
boring
there
certainly
isnt
focus
on
any
one
particular
flavor
but
im
enjoying
the
final
product
nonetheless
this
is
a
fun
beer
o
harkening
back
to
the
old
drinkability
score
on
ba
this
one
approaches
5
territory
excellent
on
a
mild
fall
afternoon
or
three
and
id
imagine
ridiculously
refreshing
on
a
hot
summers
day
this
was
a
hit
with
everyone
in
my
group
from
beer
novice
to
connoisseur
id
love
to
have
access
to
this
one
yearround
great
job
nola
a
solid
blonde
ale
overall
if
i
went
for
lighter
tasting
beers
this
would
make
a
fine
session
brew
the
bitter
finish
was
a
turnoff
better
on
tap
had
a
glass
at
the
blue
nile
on
frenchmen
this
reminds
me
of
chelseas
checker
cab
blond
though
this
was
a
bit
more
mild
the
spicy
hop
finish
was
subtle
but
tasty
as
was
the
light
pale
malt
backing
the
barley
was
a
fairly
plain
white
toast
flavor
but
it
was
all
appropriate
for
the
blonde
ale
style
a
great
summer
beer
easy
to
drink
an
excellent
lighter
bodied
beer
plenty
of
flavor
a
great
crisp
body
and
goes
down
like
water
something
that
is
great
for
the
hotter
months
or
general
everyday
drinking
highly
recommended
good
brew
i
love
the
warm
malts
and
the
way
they
sit
with
the
fruits
i
want
to
like
this
beer
it
just
tastes
a
little
off
to
me
it
has
a
nice
upfront
flavor
what
i
would
expect
from
a
blonde
the
finish
gets
me
though
there
is
a
hop
bitterness
that
i
dont
expect
or
really
appreciate
in
this
style
the
head
disappeared
right
away
and
there
was
no
lacing
present
i
cant
think
of
much
good
to
say
about
this
one
not
much
to
write
home
about
on
this
one
awkwardly
put
together
with
a
grainy
malt
character
on
par
with
most
mainstream
macro
offerings
indifferent
hopping
and
a
bit
watery
at
the
finish
not
really
even
interesting
enough
to
throw
in
the
refreshing
lawnmower
beer
category
i
tossed
the
last
of
my
beer
simply
because
i
got
bored
with
it
nice
blonde
ale
with
a
deep
tranluscent
golden
hue
nice
creamy
head
that
lasts
has
a
cream
soda
smell
right
now
but
there
is
a
lasy
next
to
me
with
some
nice
perfume
on
balanced
malt
and
hop
taste
pilsner
malts
and
a
dry
hop
bite
a
present
very
drinkable
as
it
goes
down
smooth
on
a
hot
alabama
day
nice
beer
served
with
a
thick
foamy
frothy
white
head
and
lots
of

color
was
a

aroma
was

with
a
bit
of

and

easy

brew
av
crisp
and
mildly
bitter
with
a
trace
amount
of
noble
hops
present
in
the
aftertaste
clean
with
a
vaguely
fruity
yeast
presence
fairly
simple
yet
it
hits
the
spot
nicely
well
carbed
crisp
and
refreshing
good
session
candidate
for

weather
d
i
could
have
had
the
1l
growler
on
my
own
solid
lawnmower
beer
that
is
true
to
style
and
has
a
slight
extra
kick
in
the
aroma
would
be
good
for
a
hot
summer
day
in

at

avenue
pub
in

pours
a
medium
golden
color
with

head
aroma

yeast
light
citrus
pine
and
light
on
the
malts
a
bit
sweet
to
the
taste
with
slight

presence
in
the
finish
okay
not
memorable
compared
to
the
hopatoulis
sp
or
the
brown
but
it
is
a
bit
above
average
rjt
as
a
side
note
ive
also
had
this
on
cask
a
couple
times
and
i
bet
i
would
probably
rate
it
close
to
all
5s
incredibly
smooth
with
a
much
more
powerful
aroma
and
flavor
the
regular
version
is
good
though
not
entirely
spectacular
but
if
you
ever
get
the
chance
to
try
dryhopped
on
cask
it
is
not
to
be
missed
note
the
light
of
the
bar
and
the
smoke
may
have
affected
my
review
this
is
a
very
drinkable
beer
quite
sessionable
perfect
on
a
hot
day
i
reminds
me
a
lot
of
a
pale
wheat
ale
but
more
fruity
d
this
was
a
very
crisp
clean
flavor
that
has
high
sessionable
qualities
a
great
blonde
ale
and
a
great
start
to
the
nola
brewing
company
overall
a
great
beer
from
a
new
new
orleans
brewery
this
is
a
perfect
beer
for
the
heat
and
humidity
of
new
orleans
flavor
is
so
minimal
essentially
water
with
some
beer
in
it
i
guess
i
get
the
point

and
very
smooth
and
crisp
to
drink
a
nicely
enjoyable
offering
overall
a
fair
summer
blonde
about
the
only
thing
it
did
was
make
me
wonder
why
they
ever
retired
somersault
as
their
summer
seasonal
now
that
was
a
fantastic
blonde
o
a
fairly
smooth
easy
to
drink
beer
that
has
a
unique
twist
not
many
beers
immediately
bring
to
mind
pepper
flavors
but
it
was
a
welcome
change
decent
hops
lacking
much
malt
substance
to
my
dismay
but
easy
to
drink
so
its
okay
solid
b
skinny
dip
is
the
absolute
worst
beer
ive
ever
had
it
tastes
like
cigarettes
i
am
at
a
loss
as
to
how
this
beer
has
a
score
of
78
at
the
time
of
this
review
i
made
the
severe
mistake
of
buying
a
12beer
new
belgium
sampler
pack
that
included
this
beer
i
havent
liked
a
single
new
belgium
beer
that
ive
ever
tried
overall
this
beer
is
simple
and
inoffensive
if
you
served
to
a
wide
range
of
guests
no
one
would
complain
but
there
are
better
more
exciting
beers
to
be
had
i
enjoyed
this
beer
but
will
probably
not
buy
it
again
poured
from
a
brown
12
oz
bottle
has
a
dark
golden
color
with
a
12
inch
head
smell
is
of
malts
biscuits
taste
is
of
caramel
malts
hops
are
present
some
biscuits
very
easy
drinking
feels
medium
bodied
in
the
mouth
and
overall
is
a
fine
choice
on
a
hot
summer
night
its
a
very
good
beer
t
better
than
a
macro
light
beer
but
only
by
a
slim
margin
it
sits
in
limbo
between
styles
for
me
if
i
want
water
ill
have
water
if
i
want
beer
ill
drink
something
bigger
o
a
nice
summer
beer
overall
a
decent
tasting
beer
but
for
a
light
watery
summer
beer
these
flavors
dont
really
go
with
it
more
of
a
light
autumn
beer
imo
overall
a
decent
beer
but
nothing
memorable
it
would
work
on
a
hot
summer
day
light
amber
with
a
head
that
last
and
some
decent
lacing
the
smell
is
bready
copper
toasted
malt
the
taste
is
a
biscuit
toasted
malt
with
a
slight
carmal
but
cut
with
a
little
bit
of
water
its
like
all
the
flavors
are
muted
mouthfeel
is
light
this
beer
is
nice
for
summer
kinda
bland
but
maintains
enough
flavor
to
be
decent
clear
golden
color
with
nice
lines
of
carbonation
aroma
is
weak
slightly
astringent
and
did
not
entice
me
to
drink
the
taste
was
okay
but
overall
quite
mild
with
a
slight
malty
presence
and
a
hint
of
bittering
hops
after
taste
is
crisp
but
also
acidic
and
not
ideal
in
my
book
it
goes
down
fine
but
the
mouthfeel
is
light
and
watery
overall
drinkable
and
fine
but
not
that
impressive
of
a
blonde
ale
a
style
already
not
on
my
favorites
list
pours
a
clear
golden
amber
with
a
thin
white
head
aromas
of
toasted
bread
taste
begins
with
some
toasted
bread
then
some
toffee
and
finishes
with
some
leafy
grassy
hops
mouthfeel
is
good
overall
a
pretty
good
lower
alcohol
beer
would
be
nice
after
mowing
the
lawn
skinny
dip
pours
a
golden
yellow
with
a
thick
white
head
that
drops
quickly
from
a
brown
twelve
ounce
bottle
the
aroma
is
citrusy
with
a
bit
of
grain
the
flavor
is
light
and
pleasant
with
a
similar
twang
to
it
that
fat
tire
does
the
malt
bill
finishes
a
bit
dry
nice
overall
it
was
a
little
bitter
to
be
a
real
sessionable
ale
and
is
honestly
a
bit
forgettable
nothing
really
standing
up
and
greabbing
you
about
this
one
a
decent
pale
ale
that
doesnt
really
stand
out
in
the
crowd
d
an
easy
drinker
id
have
another
one
d
although
the
beer
isnt
bad
i
will
be
unlikely
to
purchase
again
in
near
future
drinkability
is
very
good
i
would
not
say
its
spectacular
but
it
is
better
than
most
microbrews
its
on
the
verge
of
macro
level
this
is
a
great
easy
drinking
beer
for
those
that
are
not
hopdriven
its
a
light
amber
color
with
a
1
finger
white
head
the
taste
is
that
of
malt
light
citrus
and
even
lighter
hops
its
a
summer
seasonal
product
so
i
relieved
the
local
liquor
store
of
their
remaining
3
cases
in
early
fall
d
refreshing
and
easy
to
drink
skinny
dip
ale
is
crisp
and
light
or
medium
bodied
its
a
decent
choice
on
a
hot
90
degree
summer
day
thanks
to
rob
for
new
belgium
variety
pack
pours
a
slightlyhazed
yellow
color
with
a
light
white
head
and
not
much
lacing
the
nose
brings
some
really
faint
citrus
notes
other
than
that
theres
just
some
light
grain
the
taste
is
the
same
with
some
very
mild
sweetness
and
a
bit
of
citrus
light
body
drinks
fine
but
really
is
nothing
to
even
say
about
this
other
than
that
it
is
quite
plain
this
clear
golden
ale
is
new
belgiums
summer
seasonal
and
its
among
the
brewerys
lighter
offerings
the
flavor
is
mild
and
malty
with
a
slight
hoppy
character
and
a
hint
of
citrus
oddly
i
place
this
one
curiously
between
a
traditional
lager
and
a
pale
ale
its
certainly
tasty
and
unique
like
most
of
new
belgiums
employeeand
earth
friendly
brews
this
ones
quite
satisfying
light
and
has
a
great
taste
very
chuggable
i
was
really
impressed
with
this
beer
at
first
i
was
skeptical
but
it
turned
out
delicious
i
see
some
high
marks
for
this
beer
wonder
if
i
got
a
glass
from
a
bad
keg
but
nothing
terrible
just
bland
tastes
like
a
beer
but
with
lots
of
extra
water
drinkability
it
is
made
to
be
drinkable
on
a
warm
day
low
in
alcohol
soft
in
taste
as
rich
in
colour
as
a
setting
summer
sun
although
as
a
lower
calorie
and
low
abv
beer
it
does
have
a
lot
of
flavour
and
body
and
mouthfeel
going
for
it
so
im
in
a
bit
of
a
conundrum
as
how
to
rate
it
my
feeling
is
that
it
looks
great
smells
good
tastes
ok
has
a
nice
mouthfeel
but
drinks
hard
weird
d
this
is
a
great
summer
beer
nicely
balanced
and
drinkable
this
will
definitely
quench
thirst
after
a
long
hot
day
while
nothing
spectacular
this
is
a
solid
beer
with
a
good
amount
of
flavor
and
refreshment
cheers
d
a
very
nice
drinkable
and
sessionable
beer
certainly
an
interesting
take
on
the
summer
seasonal
i
must
compliment
nb
in
that
i
was
very
worried
that
the
advertised
lime
flavor
would
be
too
central
to
this
beer
but
it
was
constructed
in
a
way
that
was
well
balanced
and
enjoyable
could
certainly
use
some
tweaking
but
its
pretty
good
and
refreshing
both
in
theory
and
practice
d
pretty
well
rounded
offering
the
flavours
are
nicely
balanced
and
theres
nothing
to
complain
about
an
interesting
offering
the
mild
but
weird
citrus
matched
with
the
biscuity
malt
makes
for
one
crisp
beverage
to
use
new
belgiums
lingo
however
it
gets
a
little
watery
towards
the
end
making
this
easy
to
drink
but
also
easy
to
forget
passed
to
me
at
a
bbq
pours
an
interesting
amber
with
a
decent
head
that
doesnt
last
smells
lightly
of
hops
but
with
a
different
citrus
beneath
it
the
taste
has
the
same
interesting
undertone
and
when
i
read
the
label
kaffir
lime
leaf
is
mentioned
there
we
go
crisp
and
finishes
nicely
an
enjoyable
brew
to
quaff
poolside
in
the
summer
transparent
copper
brew
with
a
solid
offwhite
head
and
rings
of
lace
malt
backbone
is
subdued
in
the
taste
to
give
way
for
an
assertive
pine
hop
there
is
also
an
off
flavor
here
that
i
cant
quite
put
my
finger
on
garlic
maybe
anyways
its
not
too
pleasant
light
to
mediumbodied
and
drying
on
the
tongue
overall
pretty
average
beer
wont
be
buying
it
any
time
soon
drinks
well
another
good
beer
to
possibly
wean
bmc
drinkers
to
better
beers
a
solid
if
unspectacular
offering
from
a
solid
brewery
i
dont
think
anybody
goes
into
a
beer
like
this
expecting
something
mindblowing
however
if
youre
looking
for
a
summer
refresher
that
is
easy
sipping
well
this
is
your
beer
the
label
also
says
it
is
fullbodied
i
didnt
think
a
4
abv
beer
could
be
fullbodied
and
i
still
dont
it
could
pass
for
medium
again
though
just
like
the
smell
foretold
the
taste
and
mouthfeel
are
not
strong
but
not
bad
a
surprising
amount
of
bitterness
and
overall
kick
lots
of
flavor
one
of
the
best
beers
ive
had
at
under
5
definitely
recommended
for
a
summer
session
so
of
course
a
beer
that
lacks
definitive
flavor
is
going
to
take
its
lumps
from
me
but
i
think
this
is
decent
for
what
it
set
out
to
be
a
light
summer
beer
that
will
keep
you
in
skinnydipping
shape
taste
a
little
spring
floral
feel
minor
twang
of
carbonation
and
lemon
a
good
marginal
palate
cleanser
between
heavier
styles
easy
to
drink
but
what
really
are
you
paying
for
with
this
beer
at
the
flying
saucer
in
memphis
tn
into
a
pint
glass
it
poured
a
clear
golden
hue
with
a
thin
white
collapsing
quickly
but
leaving
good
lacing
modest
carbonation
smelled
of
apple
pear
slight
menthol
and
earthiness
the
taste
was
a
little
more
pronounced
applepear
dissolving
to
some
woody
leaves
and
then
finishing
on
a
grassyminty
note
a
rather
odd
flavor
mix
and
rather
thin
too
easy
texture
to
drink
but
not
an
easy
flavor
to
appeciate
the
flavors
and
aromas
are
mild
and
not
terribly
complex
and
the
malt
is
a
bit
full
but
this
is
a
fine
if
unspectacular
summer
brew
and
perhaps
the
first
blonde
that
ive
really
enjoyed
enough
to
not
avoid
revisiting
overall
a
good
beer
im
a
big
fan
of
new
belgium
and
this
is
the
first
time
i
have
had
anything
other
than
fat
tire
and
1554
this
is
certainly
a
lighter
beer
makes
sense
that
its
their
summer
ale
overall
drinkability
very
good
i
could
certainly
have
a
few
of
these
on
a
hot
summer
day
its
not
too
hoppy
and
its
crisp
with
a
full
mouth
feel
drinks
passably
not
a
bad
summer
drink
but
also
one
that
will
probably
not
find
its
way
into
my
fridge
again
unless
my
roommate
decides
to
pick
up
another
pack
new
belgium
skinny
dip
is
a
decent
beer
for
the
summer
season
ive
had
a
few
summer
beers
lately
and
i
would
say
this
beer
is
comparable
to
honey
moon
or
sam
adams
summer
ale
skinny
dip
has
the
typical
citrus
flavor
that
the
other
summer
beers
have
it
is
pretty
easy
to
drink
too
i
would
drink
this
beer
again
overall
id
call
this
one
very
average
it
is
what
it
is
which
is
a
light
refreshing
summer
beer
still
you
can
easily
get
similar
but
better
beers
mouthfeel
is
medium
with
a
crisp
amount
of
carbonation
highly
drinkable
a
good
sessionable
beer
to
drink
a
lot
of
on
a
warm
day
pretty
good
beer
all
in
all
very
light
and
bubbly
in
the
mouth
this
is
a
good
solid
beer
for
a
hot
summer
day
but
not
something
ill
be
seeking
out
too
often
just
not
enough
going
on
to
interest
me
all
that
much
i
was
pleasantly
surprised
by
this
beer
i
hadnt
heard
good
things
about
this
beer
but
i
dont
know
what
those
people
were
talking
about
i
found
it
very
enjoyable
would
definitely
get
this
again
drinkability
this
beer
was
much
better
than
i
expected
this
is
also
the
most
complex
refresher
beer
i
have
had
as
far
as
flavor
a
great
beer
to
have
around
because
it
tastes
good
or
just
to
have
to
refresh
yourself
skinny
dip
has
a
light
straw
color
and
a
fairly
subdued
head
that
quickly
vanishes
the
usual
new
belgium
biscuity
malt
is
present
but
it
is
not
near
as
prevalent
as
in
most
of
their
brews
the
taste
is
citrusy
and
light
i
found
the
carbonation
to
be
a
little
low
and
the
mouthfeel
a
little
thin
its
a
fine
beer
to
relax
with
in
the
sun
but
really
not
complex
enough
or
tasty
enough
for
me
to
want
another
i
think
it
is
outclassed
by
many
other
summer
seasonals
12
ounce

a

with

head
retention
is
average
with
a
good
amount
of

theres
a
nice
unique
citrusy
aroma
in
this
brew
i
guess
its
the
kaffir
lime
leaf
as
stated
on
the
label
that
i
smell
theres
also
some
sweet
malt
and
hops
noticable
too
for
the
most
part
the
taste
is
the
same
as
the
aroma
but
theres
the
addition
of
some
bready
malt
flavor
in
this
beer
theres
also
a
slight
bitter
finish
mouthfeelbody
is
light
its
crisp
with
good
carbonation
drinkability
is
good
its
nice
and
enjoyable
i
liked
this
brew
it
was
a
pleasant
surprise
ill
have
to
buy
some
more
the
next
time
i
see
it
since
its
not
available
in
ohio
wont
have
any
trouble
finishing
of
the
second
bottle
that
is
left
d
you
know
its
an
ok
beer
but
it
just
doesnt
do
it
for
me
drinkability
is
fair
for
what
it
is
but
its
not
an
offering
from
new
belgium
id
go
to
often
if
ever
again
md
light
bodied
no
drying
effect
and
decent

best

this

is
a
great
summer
beer
and
with

like

skinny

might
be

a
very
refreshing
brew
the
lime
isnt
overpowering
to
the
point
of
hurting
my

as
that
of

seasonal
modest
spicy
grassy

with

in

background
overall
it
quaffed

was

refreshing
as
i
ended
a
long

of

in
color
or
in

but
what
do
i
know
worth
a
try
if
youre
making
your
way
through
texas
craft
beers
poured
from
the
bottle
into
a
tasting
glass
the
appearance
is
light
amber
in
color
with
with
light
creamy
head
the
nose
is
very
biscuity
with
a
nice
balance
of
maltiness
and
the
cascade
hopes
the
taste
is
initially
malt
sweetness
and
toasty
with
a
hint
of
citrus
and
hops
the
mouthfeel
is
mediumbodied
and
slightly
slippery
i
think
this
is
a
wonderful
summer
session
beer
d
i
would
probably
not
buy
this
again
but
those
at
the
party
i
went
to
helped
me
finish
my
6
pack
it
was
well
received
by
others
who
mostly
drink
bmc
beers
if
you
are
looking
for
a
good
intro
into
the
craft
beer
world
i
guess
this
would
be
the
ticket
d
this
is
a
perfect
example
of
what
a
summertime
session
beer
should
be
good
taste
with
a
low
abv
thats
easy
to
drink
all
day
in
the
sun
this
is
my
least
favorite
beer
from
new
belgium
at
the
same
time
it
probably
gives
them
the
best
margin
of
profit
it
is
a
pale
yellow
wit
a
tan
head
the
nose
is
of
grainy
malts
and
light
hops
the
flavor
is
light
for
a
blond
light
feel
leads
to
an
overall
light
beer
id
probably
go
for
something
cheaper
if
i
was
in
th
emood
for
this
style
skinny
dip
is
a
exceptional
session
brew
that
is
not
only
refreshing
but
is
perfect
for
those
looking
for
the
figurefriendly
alternative
to
those
light
or
ultra
beers
this
summer
if
anyone
cares
skinny
dip
is
only
114
calories
per
12oz
serving
poured
a
clear
amber
color
with
a
moderate
white
head
that
disipates
rather
quickly
but
still
leaves
some
traces
of
lace
the
aroma
is
bready
with
just
a
suggestion
of
citrus
the
taste
is
light
bready
malt
with
a
trace
of
caramel
and
citrus
slightly
dry
from
the
start
with
a
nicely
dry
citrus
finish
smooth
and
easy
to
take
in
quantity
i
can
think
of
other
good
blondes
to
spend
my
money
on
i
do
enjoy
more
body
to
my
brew
but
when
youre
on
the
beach
hanging
out
at
a
backyard
bbq
or
out
mowing
the
yard
in
the
haze
of
july
this
is
an
excellent
companion
to
have
light
color
but
not
too
light
it
seems
to
hit
the
mark
for
style
the
smell
had
a
decent
hop
aroma
which
i
did
not
expect
from
tasting
this
beer
last
year
maybe
i
forgot
the
nutty
malt
flavor
is
reminiscent
of
fat
tire
and
works
well
for
the
beer
this
is
a
great
spring
summer
fall
or
winter

overall
perhaps
a

beer
and
one
that
would

thirst
quencher
i
honestly
did
not
mean
to
buy
this
beer
today
early
today
i
pulled
one
out
of
a
mothership
wit
6pack
and
tonight
bam
a
beer
that
i
had
no
intention
of
buying
that
being
said
i
am
very
glad
i
revisited
it
all
my
notes
from
this
brew
say
how
much
i
dont
like
it
but
sitting
here
trying
to
be
objective
this
is
a
damn
good
lite
beer
perfect
for
sitting
in
the
sun
or
mowing
the
lawn
or
simply
wanting
a
beer
with
real
flavor
and
not
wanting
to
get
hammered
a
mild
nose
with
not
much
to
it
you
get
a
somewhat
thick
and
staying
mouthful
of
slight
bitterness
with
just
a
touch
of
citrus
brew
its
a
seasonal
released
in
spring
and
it
is
september
as
i
am
drinking
it
so
who
knows
how
that
would
affect
the
taste
it
says
it
is
good
before
december
6th
overall
i
cant
say
i
would
look
forward
to
it
next
year
that
slight
edge
of
bitter
and
the
overall
citrus
edge
to
it
isnt
for
me
and
it
lacks
the
right
punch
to
be
considered
anything
but
just
being
somewhat
good
clear
orange
in
color
average
size
white
head
some
lacing
citrus
hops
in
the
aroma
light
and
refreshing
beer
it
is
indeed
a
great
summer
brew
however
it
is
too
light
for
my
naste
little
hoppy
bitterness
produces
nice
mouthfeel
i
will
gladly
enjoy
this
beer
on
a
hot
summer
day
perfect
light
beer
d
overall
i
was
not
impressed
with
this
beer
at
all
it
is
not
on
the
top
of
my
list
from
new
belgium
brewing
the
only
thing
that
i
can
say
that
sums
up
this
beer
for
me
is
that
i
only
drank
half
of
it
and
would
not
chooses
it
again
pours
a
clear
amberish
almost
a
rusty
water
color
the
head
is
about
two
and
a
half
fingers
of
creamy
white
head
with
good
retention
a
leaves
lots
of
lacing
aroma
has
the
typical
new
belgium
yeast
smell
to
it
along
with
some
lime
not
a
very
strong
aroma
taste
is
sort
of
grainy
along
with
more
lime
and
a
faint
touch
of
toasted
malt
very
bitter
and
not
a
lot
of
malt
to
balance
it
out
mouthfeel
is
thin
and
fizzy
with
a
dry
finish
the
dryness
and
bitterness
definitely
bring
the
drinkability
down
not
one
i
would
really
care
to
purchase
again
kind
of
like
watered
down
fat
tire
with
lime
juice
d
very
high
a
great
beer
for
a
hot
summer
day
a
5050
mix
of
this
with
my
other
nonblonde
ale
blue
frog
blonde
ale
and
you
might
be
getting
close
to
the
actual
style
a
lighter
ale
the
new
belgium
skinny
dip
is
a
good
choice
when
looking
for
a
beer
that
has
a
sweeter
taste
with
a
slight
bite
in
the
aftertaste
served
from
a
bottle
the
beer
produces
a
medium
head
that
i
would
say
has
a
medium
thickness
that
lasts
more
than
a
few
moments
the
color
is
a
clear
light
amberorange
and
the
lightness
is
reflected
in
the
taste
like
other
ales
the
smell
is
more
bitter
than
the
taste
but
both
are
exceptional
the
beer
is
very
smooth
and
carbonation
goes
unnoticed
while
drinking
unlike
lite
incarnations
of
many
beers
this
is
a
very
drinkable
beer
not
one
that
makes
you
not
want
to
stop
but
it
is
very
good
and
pleasant
nonetheless
altogether
skinny
dip
is
a
very
enjoyable
light
summer
beer
party
its
too
bad
winters
on
the
way
as
much
of
this
stuff
as
i
have
consumed
this
summer
i
thought
i
had
allready
reviewed
the
brew
anyhow
pours
a
rich
light
amber
color
with
a
nice
cream
colored
head
first
impressions
speak
of
toasty
biscuit
some
light
hop
and
a
citrus
finish
on
the
lemonlime
side
fairly
well
carbonated
and
refreshing
as
a
summer
seasonal
should
be
i
have
found
it
very
satisfying
after
mowing
the
yard
catching
some
fish
barbqueing
and
finally
this
fall
downing
a
few
birds
afield
serve
this
one
icy
cold
mmm
and
word
has
it
same
carbs
and
calories
as
some
of
the
rediculous
offerings
of
the
big
three
a
great
light
choice
d
this
beer
has
a
big
biscuit
malt
flavor
which
grows
a
bit
mundane
after
a
few
sips
but
the
hops
although
soft
have
a
nice
depth
and
this
is
really
the
best
use
of
kefir
lime
leaves
i
have
tasted
they
offer
a
nice
compliment
to
the
hops
without
being
overbearing
or
buried
drinkability
this
beer
is
highly
drinkable
despite
being
unbalanced
in
taste
the
beer
is
very
refreshing
and
paired
nicely
with
the
spicy
pad
thai
that
i
had
its
citrus
notes
are
very
plesant
and
are
not
overpowering
and
only
a
mild
alcohol
sting
comes
through
as
the
beer
warms
okay
but
thin
i
suppose
it
does
have
more
to
offer
than
a
typical
light
or
macro
brew
but
i
wouldnt
go
out
of
my
way
to
get
it
this
is
fine
drinking
beer
for
friendsnothing
extreme
nothing
special
either
medium
bodied
very
refreshing
the
kaffir
lime
leaves
seem
to
lend
a
interesting
bay
leaf
citrus
note
reminds
me
of
fat
tire
with
a
bit
more
chutzpah
thanks
brewjones
bought
a
six
pack
for
7
99
at
a
local
grocer
liked
fat
tire
so
thought
id
give
it
a
try
appearance
is
similar
to
fat
tire
wit
the
dark
amber
and
medium
buble
carbonation
that
stays
for
a
long
time
on
the
edge
of
the
glass
hints
of
citrus
with
hops
make
a
bouquet
not
unlike
the
fat
tire
cousin
but
the
taste
is
not
as
impressive
as
fat
tire
easily
drinkable
and
smooth
with
appropriate
carbonation
guess
this
is
for
people
who
want
fat
tire
light
had
i
known
this
id
have
purchased
the
original
fat
tire
since
it
is
all
around
a
better
beer
for
the
value
a
nice
summer
offering
not
great
but
certainly
worth
a
try
decent
summer
and
seemed
to
be
selling
well
everywhere
overall
i
enjoyed
it
a
lot
and
recommend
it
surprisingly
the
hops
arent
the
first
thing
i
noticed
in
the
flavor
the
pale
malt
is
front
and
center
lightly
sweet
with
a
creamy
mouth
the
cascade
kicks
in
lightly
for
balance
but
this
beer
is
far
less
crisp
than
i
was
expecting
and
finishes
very
clean
more
sweet
in
the
finish
than
dry
7
g
carbs
i
tried
this
on
tap
at
the
burger
bar
in
the
mandalay
bay
resort
in
las
vegas
it
was
described
to
me
as
a
summer
wheat
beer
but
really
it
seemed
to
be
just
a
light
and
easy
to
drink
ale
the
beer
was
pale
straw
color
and
crystal
clear
with
a
lightly
hopped
aroma
the
taste
was
basically
neutral
maybe
a
touch
of
citrus
character
from
the
hops
or
from
the
lime
thats
added
during
production
fermentation
according
to
the
website
extremely
easy
on
the
palate
and
probably
a
very
good
barbeque
beer
a
nice
summer
sipping
beer
on
a
cool
day
works
well
with
a
light
salad
added
lime
is
an
interesting
touch
in
the
style
worth
a
try
for
something
with
a
different
approach
to
the
style
overall
a
good
beer
to
drink
very
refreshing
in
a
23
beer
setting
after
reading
other
reviews
and
checking
newbelgium

i
see
this
is

and
the
afore
mentioned
hint
of
lime
fairly
bland
mouthfeel
is
crisp
and
somewhat
refreshing
drinkability
is
fair
im
just
not
a
fan
of
this
brew
d
very
light
and
smooth
a
good
summer
beer
i
may
buy
again
i
dont
know
for
sure
just
slightly
above
average
for
me
d
easy
to
drink
especially
on
a
hot
summer
night
i
can
see
having
6
or
more
of
these
on
hand
for
the
summer
except
you
cant
get
this
stuff
in
massachusetts
i
wish
the
kaffir
lime
was
a
little
more
pronounced
but
i
enjoyed
this
a
great
deal
and
will
keep
a
six
in
my
fridge
at
all
times
this
summer
to
flip
some
light
beer
drinkers
same
calories
and
carbs
as
bud
light
drinkability
great
this
is
as
close
to
bud
light
as
i
ever
want
to
get
really
refreshing
and
smooth
pours
an
orangish
amber
color
topped
by
a
pinky
fingers
worth
of
creamy
white
head
aroma
of
lightly
sweet
malt
apricot
sweetness
and
a
touch
of
citrusy
aromatic
hops
palate
is
wellbalanced
between
light
malt
and
lightly
citrusy
hops
but
theres
not
all
that
much
there
finish
is
dry
and
a
little
chalky
this
definitely
goes
down
easy
on
a
hot
summer
night
but
it
leaves
a
bit
to
be
desired
decent
thickness
to
the
mouthfeel
although
the
watery
taste
cant
help
but
make
the
mouthfeel
seem
almost
thin
i
dont
really
get
this
beer
it
doesnt
taste
bad
but
it
just
doesnt
taste
like
much
i
hope
this
isnt
a
sign
that
new
belgium
is
setting
the
bar
lower
as
it
expands
across
the
mississippi
while
this
beer
is
light
and
easy
to
drink
its
a
little
too
light
for
me
even
for
the
summer
if
america
started
drinking
this
instead
of
miller
or
bud
litelight
i
would
be
the
happiest
guy
in
the
world
but
at
10
a
six
pack
i
need
a
little
more
substance
had
this
on
tap
in
colorado
so
it
was
very
fresh
poured
into
a
pint
glass
with
a
great
fluffy
head
taste
had
just
a
hint
of
citrus
with
some
good
hop
bitterness
coming
through
as
well
it
was
very
refeshing
and
drinkable
i
enjoyed
this
beer
and
its
worth
a
try
drink
cold
and
fast
for
best
results
pours
clear
light
copper
with
orange
and
gold
tones
large
and
foamy
barelyoffwhite
head
quickly
dies
down
to
chunky
bubbles
with
medium
lacing
aroma
is
of
shortbread
and
buttery
malts
distant
floral
hops
and
a
noticeable
doughy
yeast
element
mouthfeel
is
lightbodied
and
crisp
flavor
is
sour
crisp
and
pleasing
bready
malts
backed
by
sourdough
and
wheat
notes
a
notable
strain
of
citrus
lime
in
back
some
pleasant
earthiness
and
hop
spice
along
with
buttery
malts
round
out
the
finish
aftertaste
is
crisp
and
mildly
sour
overall
easy
to
drink
quite
refreshing
and
tasty
on
a
hot
texas
summer
night
good
flavor
for
a
light
beer
not
terribly
complex
but
it
isnt
supposed
to
be
overall
decent
effort
but
not
spectacular
id
drink
it
again
no
problem
12
oz
bottle
this
beer
is
a
solid
golden
color
with
a
finger
of
cream
colored
head
that
falls
to
a
light
coat
over
top
a
healthy
carbonation
is
streaming
up
through
the
very
clear
beer
the
aroma
is
grainy
biscuity
and
slightly
lime
citrusy
this
has
a
very
aggressive
edge
from
the
malt
component
that
i
just
dont
find
appealing
this
is
an
edge
i
associate
with
biscuit
malt
the
flavor
starts
with
an
aggressive
husky
grain
and
biscuity
character
with
a
zesty
lime
citrus
character
i
find
the
flavor
to
be
a
bit
watered
down
after
the
initial
kick
mouthfeel
is
light
with
a
moderate
carbonation
this
one
is
very
easy
to
drink
it
is
light
and
refreshing
im
not
a
huge
fan
of
the
flavor
profile
of
the
beer
but
i
think
they
are
hitting
what
they
want
with
it
while
somewhat
refreshing
on
its
own
as
a
beer
this
isnt
so
great
the
lime
and
other
citrus
becomes
very
monotonous
and
seems
to
drown
out
any
other
flavors
that
may
be
present
while
i
enjoyed
this
beerit
was
not
very
exciting
or
unique
very
well
made
but
i
was
looking
for
more
punch
poured
a
crisp
golden
color
with
an
inviting
white
head
clean
and
mild
aromas
of
grain
and
malt
this
beer
is
light
yet
packs
a
good
amount
of
flavor
considering
besides
the
light
malt
character
and
touch
of
hops
there
is
also
a
spicy
lime
flavor
that
is
very
refreshing
another
solid
brew
fron
new
belgium
extremely
thirstquenching
and
drinkable
the
beer
has
a
great
golden
color
to
it
a
slightly
intense
hop
smell
which
i
love
the
head
seems
to
linger
for
a
short
time
while
retaining
a
thin
lace
the
taste
in
very
rich
but
not
too
overwealming
this
beer
is
not
very
thick
and
not
very
filling
making
it
a
very
drinkable
and
overall
great
tasting
beer
cheers
scoring
based
on
light
esb
golden
amber
color
and
a
nice
head
pillowy
lacing
lingers
on
top
and
sticks
pleasingly
to
sides
of
the
glass
the
smell
suggests
nothing
beyond
the
fact
that
this
is
beer
the
taste
is
a
nice
refresing
splash
of
summery
goodness
it
must
be
the
yeast
at
nb
that
lends
the
fat
tire
light
quality
as
the
biscuit
vibe
is
here
as
well
but
more
subtle
the
kaffir
lime
makes
an
appearance
in
the
later
stages
of
the
taste
mouthfeel
is
not
exciting
in
any
way
but
crisp
and
refreshing
not
a
particularly
interesting
beer
but
a
profoundly
refreshing
one
and
thats
what
they
were
going
for
nice
job
d
not
a
bad
beer
but
seemed
kinda
one
dimensional
in
taste
they
claim
there
should
be
quite
a
bit
of
cascade
hop
character
in
this
but
i
dont
see
it
not
a
great
beer
but
drinkable
and
appropriate
in
many
settings
think
of
this
as
fat
tire
light
pours
an
orange
amber
color
with
a
white
head
on
top
that
fades
into
a
moderate
lace
nose

and
biscuity

taste
is
bright
and
crisp
with
sweet
caramel
and
bready
malts
along
with
citrusy
hops
and
a
hint
of
lime
a
refreshing
brew
that
would
be
nice
on
a
hot
day
pours
an
amber
color
without
much
of
a
head
low
carbonation
nose
is
lightly
fruited
beer
is
refrshingly
plain
but
enjoyable
especially
considering
the
lowcalorie
aspect
and
the
tastes
of
this
beer
grouping
taste
of
ripe
apples
wouldnt
mind
having
a
sixer
of
this
in
the
summer
but
if
i
am
to
go
light
id
still
choose
sam
adams
thanks
to
jhammerly
for
the
bottle
this
is
a
gentley
bittered
beer
with
mild
acidic
qualities
in
robust
body
of
light
grain
flavor
there
is
a
slight
twang
in
the
finish
this
is
extremely
refreshing
the
carbonation
is
lively
and
the
mouthfeel
is
light
i
get
a
slight
citrusy
sting
thanks
to
bditty187
this
was
brought
to
me
with
a
big
rocky
bonewhite
head
the
color
was
a
deep
gold
with
great
clarity
the
nose
had
a
slightly
sweet
fruitiness
to
it
the
mouthfeel
was
medium
with
a
lightly
malty
aspect
in
the
mouth
the
finish
was
slightly
dry
and
almost
peppery
i
found
it
to
be
very
refreshing
on
a
nebraska
evening
in
july
excellent
summer
beer
that
is
far
more
interesting
than
most
in
its
style
drinkability
a
sessionable
beer
on
a
summer
day
refreshing
i
could
definitely
go
for
a
few
of
these
in
summer
at
almost
any
event
and
probably
during
any
other
part
of
the
year
for
that
matter
thanks
to
gbontrag
for
the
bottle
very
clear
pale
orange
body
with
light
foam
not
a
whole
lot
going
on
the
tastes
are
very
subtle
soft
malts
at
the
start
followed
by
a
touch
of
bitterness
the
finish
is
a
bit
harsh
with
hints
of
corn
syrup
it
eventually
softens
again
and
leaves
behind
a
nice
grapefruit
aftertaste
the
mouthfeel
is
incredibly
light
airy
with
lots
of
carbonation
highly
drinkable
light
and
refreshing
nothing
too
complex
going
on
i
think
this
would
go
over
well
for
people
who
are
looking
for
a
light
beer
that
doesnt
bring
on
nausea
overall
a
decent
light
microbew
looks
pretty
good
when
poured
its
a
clear
amber
color
with
ok
lacing
the
nose
is
a
little
metallic
with
cascade
hops
and
not
much
else
the
taste
is
like
cornflakes
but
not
in
a
good
way
just
very
macrotasting
and
the
mouthfeel
is
also
macroey
and
thin
the
drinkability
is
ok
i
guess
because
there
is
nothing
offensive
about
this
beer
it
just
doesnt
have
much
oomph
beer
pours
a
golden
orange
color
with
a
decent
head
nose
is
pretty
nondescript
malt
with
perhaps
a
slight
hint
of
a
sweet
fruit
taste
is
malty
slightly
sweet
with
a
light
hop
finish
mouthfeel
is
a
bit
thin
with
no
special
qualities
drinkability
is
ok
this
makes
for
a
good
social
cocktail
hour
beer
as
one
would
get
full
before
they
would
get
faced
with
this
brew
for
an
ale
this
beer
tastes
very
similar
to
a
lager
this
beer
isnt
exactly
bursting
with
flavor
either
good
to
try
but
not
recommended
nevertheless
a
decent
beer
for
a
hot
summer
day
pours
a
dirty
blonde
more
amber
with
hints
of
of
sunshine
decent
bubbling
and
sparse
thin
lacing
decent
head
and
film
the
aroma
was
a
little
mettalic
with
some
hints
of
bright
sweet
malts
the
first
taste
was
preety
bad
but
i
eventually
warmed
up
to
the
battery
end
flavor
with
some
very
stale
malts
and
musty
hops
nothing
exceptional
with
this
american
blonde
ale
from
nbb
when
poured
it
was
a
clear
medium
golden
in
color
with
a
average
amount
of
foam
and
very
little
lace
the
smell
of
hops
was
very
evident
in
fact
over
powering
the
taste
was
of
cascade
hops
with
a
touch
of
spices
with
a
hint
of
fruit
not
really
that
well
balanced
with
all
of
the
ingredients
the
hops
over
powering
taste
masked
the
other
flavors
smell
and
taste
very
nice
not
as
exciting
as
the
waitress
recommendation
of
it
but
still
a
pleasant
experience
some
nice
citrus
flavor
that
seemed
to
come
and
go
light
hops
flavor
some
bitter
hints
that
seem
to
come
and
go
amidst
a
bit
of
wateryness
from
what
the
description
tells
is
kaffir
lime
leaf
the
beer
went
down
smoothly
and
far
too
quickly
in
the
nice
evening
air
however
this
can
play
in
its
favor
as
a
great
summer
session
beer
the
light
body
and
mild
malt
and
hop
profile
really
lend
this
to
be
a
refreshing
beer
on
a
hot
august
afternoon
overall
obviously
set
up
to
drink
in
the
summer
for
sure
and
it
works
well
a
sixpack
is
a
little
expensive
on
the
west
coast
but
i
would
have
no
problems
romping
with
the
skinny
dip
sextuplets
should
the
price
be
right
ill
be
the
first
to
admit
that
im
a
bit
of
a
new
belgium
fanboy
but
thats
what
happens
when
your
first
beer
ever
is
a
new
belgium
abby
this
beer
pours
a
dark
orange
something
i
find
quite
pretty
and
it
had
a
nice
creamy
head
you
can
definatly
smell
lots
of
hopps
and
a
slight
sweetness
this
beer
has
a
slight
tartness
and
a
definate
spicyness
to
it
though
that
could
just
be
the
nearly
excessive
carbonation
and
its
rounded
out
with
a
slight
citrusy
flavor
it
has
a
bit
of
a
watery
mouthfeel
but
that
seems
to
add
to
the
character
of
the
beer
this
is
definatly
a
refreshing
beer
one
that
you
would
drink
after
a
long
and
hot
day
im
seriously
considering
taking
a
6
pack
or
two
down
a
river
for
some
late
season
tubing
overall
its
enjoyable
but
not
one
of
new
belgiums
best
served
to
me
in
a
pint
glass
has
the
color
of
brass
with
a
moderate
head
that
laces
all
the
way
down
smell
is
mostly
of
hops
and
some
lime
nothing
too
special
taste
is
of
a
solid
malt
backbone
with
hops
and
the
kaffir
lime
i
dont
get
as
much
hop
flavor
as
i
do
get
the
balancing
bitterness
but
the
lime
takes
care
of
the
finishing
flavor
somehow
theres
too
much
of
that
new
belgium
house
toast
flavor
mouthfeel
is
a
bit
watery
decent
overall
drinkability
well
at
4
2
its
very
very
light
my
only
knock
would
be
that
its
too
carbinated
it
slows
you
down
yet
i
think
that
it
is
a
great
aspect
of
this
beer
so
i
wouldnt
change
it
a
damn
fine
beer
i
would
say
is
more
of
a
light
pale
ale
than
a
blonde
as
it
is
really
more
hop
than
malt
based
a
good
crowd
pleaser
no
doubt
i
cant
believe
i
waited
til
the
end
of
of
summer
for
this
one
after
the
forced
slowdown
i
grilled
some
indian
style
chicken
marinated
in
a
tomato
sauce
served
over
rice
and
spiced
with
garam
marsala
garlic
red
chili
and
coriander
the
dish
packed
a
notsosubtle
punch
this
beer
went
perfectly
with
dinner
apparently
the
juxtaposition
of
countries
worked
well
with
my
americanized
indian
dish
and
belgianized
american
blonde
ale
unlike
most
sweet
or
spicy
dishes
that
usually
compete
with
beer
especially
hoppy
beers
the
sweetspicy
tomato
sauce
was
brought
to
life
by
the
juicy
orange
skinny
dip
which
contributed
its
own
aromatic
spices
the
hops
in
the
beer
were
low
enough
profilewise
to
allow
the
taffy
malts
to
emerge
without
being
too
sweet
id
definitely
drink
this
again
this
is
one
excellent
light
beer
and
reminds
me
of
fat
tire
a
fat
tire
with
a
splash
of
limeskinny
dip
this
is
a
solid
drinker
and
living
proof
that
light
beers
can
be
tasty
overall
impression
a
fairly
complex
lighter
beer
a
good
summer
sipper
with
some
belgian
overtones
im
glad
to
see
they
tweaked
the
loft
in
a
good
direction
worth
a
try
skinny
dip
may
not
be
great
beer
but
it
is
great
light
beer
although
i
can
think
of
a
few
tweaks
here
and
there
if
i
had
to
drink
low
calorie
low
carbohydrate
beer
for
the
rest
of
my
life
the
stuff
of
nightmares
i
know
then
id
begin
and
probably
end
with
skinny
dip
d
easy
to
drink
a
solid
summer
refresher
not
a
wow
beer
but
after
a
hot
day
this
does
the
trick
amber
orange
in
color
off
white
head
dies
quickly
to
a
film
but
lasts
as
such
for
the
entire
beer
not
like
a
dark
roast
of
course
but
a
nice
malty
aroma
musty
cascade
hops
almost
like
a
german
or
czech
pils
the
taste
is
quite
sweet
with
slightly
toasted
malt
accented
nicely
with
the
kafir
lime
leaf
to
give
it
a
good
zesty
flavor
and
mouthfeel
they
really
used
hops
well
in
this
too
fresh
and
a
bit
floral
but
a
bit
musty
and
resinous
nice
crisp
mouthfeel
far
from
the
dankest
beer
but
i
feel
like
this
one
is
put
together
very
well
simple
beer
all
in
all
but
with
just
enough
flavor
to
make
it
standout
from
other
summer
session
beers
i
will
be
looking
for
a
six
pack
soon
all
around
a
great
beer
to
quench
a
thirst
with
some
simple
but
good
flavors
that
dont
overwhelm
in
a
good
way
the
very
drinkable
with
low
alcohol
content
and
good
taste
i
think
this
would
make
an
excellent
session
beer
this
has
to
be
one
of
the
most
flavoful
beers
with
only
110
calories
overall
nothing
great
but
more
good
than
bad
good
enough
to
cool
down
with
on
a
hot
day
and
an
added
crisp
feeling
this
is
an
american
blond
ale

its
not
suppose
to
be
an
asskicker
drinkability
very
easy
to
drink
very
refreshing
could
drink
a
few
of
these
easily
d
very
drinkable
pours
an
orange
copper
with
a
white
fizzy
head
that
settles
nicely
into
the
session
the
smell
is
of
malts
and
a
nice
hint
of
citrus
fruit
with
caramel
glazed
grain
the
taste
is
light
hints
of
hops
in
the
forefront
that
settle
upon
delicate
but
satisfying
citrus
flavors
this
light
bodied
blonde
went
well
at
the
beach
on
a
gorgeous
day
i
think
this
beer
speaks
volumes
for
where
light
beer
can
go
at
110
calories
and
with
a
taste
this
should
serve
as
a
solid
stepping
stone
for
light
beers
in
the
future
drinkability
i
waivered
on
this
one
going
from
average
to
good
and
back
to
average
again
this
was
not
one
i
wanted
a
second
pint
of
but
one
i
would
have
again
definitely
different
from
other
blondes
on
the
market
poured
a
light
golden
brown
with
lots
of
head
that
quickly
diminished
very
light
hints
of
lime
and
malt
in
the
smell
the
mouthfeel
and
taste
reminded
me
of
a
dressed
up
club
soda
with
a
slight
hint
of
lime
this
beer
is
drinkable
and
would
be
great
as
a
thirst
quencher
on
a
hot
day
otherwise
i
found
it
relatively
unremarkable
to
give
it
a
slightly
larger
market
id
up
the
body
a
tad
and
tone
back
the
flavoring
and
aroma
hops
hmm
heck
i
might
even
think
it
was
pretty
good
then
d
drinkable
a
nice
little
brew
from
nb
would
definitely
recommend
nice
mouthfeel
goes
down
easy
very
drinkable
especially
on
a
warm
and
sunny
texas
afternoon
id
recommend
with
any
type
of
backyard
feasting
especially
chicken
or
fajitas
if
this
truly
is
a
litebeer
its
the
best
ive
ever
had
would
i
have
another
no
thanks
i
dont
find
much
here
that
really
pleases
me
for
a
beer
of
such
low
alcohol
level
it
doesnt
go
down
all
that
easily
picked
up
a
few
new
belgium
brews
when
i
was
in
omaha
this
one
would
be
a
good
beer
to
introduce
to
macrobrew
drinkers
a
few
new
flavors
for
macro
drinkers
but
nothing
outstanding
very
light
and
easy
to
drink
but
theres
just
not
a
lot
of
flavor
to
this
beer
well
this
is
not
the
beer
i
tasted
the
first
time
this
one
is
pleasant
drinkable
and
a
nice
choice
for
a
summer
afternoon
d
i
hate
grainy
finishes
i
really
do
i
wasnt
a
fan
the
body
is
light
and
prickly
with
carbonation
the
hops
bitterness
is
just
about
right
for
such
a
brew
drinkability
is
good
very
easy
to
put
down
several
due
to
the
low
alcohol
but
eventually
i
will
seek
out
bolder
flavors
and
fuller
body
even
during
the
summer
drinkability
excellent
whether
having
one
slowly
or
one
after
the
other
it
goes
down
easily
it
doesnt
leave
any
aftertaste
or
grow
tiresome
quickly
its
a
pleasant
tasteweight
for
your
mouth
all
night
extremely
drinkable
i
have
quaffed
many
pints
in
a
row
at
crescent
moon
this
is
a
really
solid
nbb
beer
it
is
will
be
a
stable
in
the
summer
it
is
simply
lovely
on
an
unrelated
note
i
love
the
artwork
on
the
label
these
notes
were
taken
will
imbibing
at
crescent
moon
in
omaha
it
is
worth
checking
out
a
session
brew
to
be
sure
i
wont
be
begging
colorado
dwellers
to
be
shipping
this
to
me
by
the
case
but
i
wouldnt
turn
it
down
and
would
like
to
see
this
and
other
new
belgium
brews
nearby
this
is
a
pretty
beer
a
lovely
clear
strawberry
blonde
with
a
nice
head
and
okay
lacing
nose
is
malty
biscuits
soaked
in
malts
tastes
reminds
me
a
bit
of
pork
slap
in
the
biscuity
cookieness
yeah
a
slightly
bitter
butter
cookie
makes
sense
to
me
toasty
caramely
cookie
mouthfeel
starts
wet
and
chewy
and
finishes
dry
leaving
you
seemingly
more
parched
than
before
you
sipped
making
you
want
more
very
drinkable
not
heavy
my
one
lonely
bottle
from
colorado
went
too
quickly
who
wants
to
send
more
to
me
in
nyc
stands
true
the
new
belgium
style
of
very
different
brews
an
intellectual
beer
that
keeps
you
guessing
easy
enough
to
drink
but
boring
as
hell
decent
for
a
lawnmower
beer
clear
copper
with
two
fingers
worth
of
white
head
that
quickly
disappears
leaving
only
a
ring
light
biscuity
malts
mix
with
lemonlime
hints
in
the
aroma
the
taste
is
almost
as
light
as
the
scent
malts
and
citrus
blend
well
but
leave
a
slightly
sour
aftertaste
that
i
could
do
without
thin
body
with
light
carbonation
glad
i
tried
it
but
think
i
may
pass
on
this
one
from
now
on
d
the
drinkability
is
good
nothing
bad
here
just
not
my
thing
this
beer
isnt
overwhelmingly
impressive
it
isnt
aweinspiringly
complex
and
its
not
even
something
i
would
necessarily
recommend
to
beer
afficianados
what
it
is
is
one
of
several
examples
of
why
the
likes
of
corona
which
costs
only
slightly
less
by
the
6pack
from
what
ive
seen
should
be
yanked
off
the
shelves
if
youre
looking
for
a
light
smooth
refreshing
easytodrink
beer
that
you
can
pour
back
several
of
during
a
lounge
out
in
the
sun
or
a
barbeque
this
is
a
definite
winner
and
you
dont
even
have
to
throw
a
freaking
lime
wedge
into
it
the
taste
is
already
there
drinkability
a
very
refreshing
summer
thirst
quencher
low
alcohol
content
makes
this
easily
sessioable
as
well
with
temps
in
the
90s
now
its
great
to
see
light
summer
beer
like
this
out
a
great
early
kick
off
for
memorial
day
weekend
im
glad
i
still
have
a
few
more
of
these
left
and
i
will
probably
purchase
again
before
summer
is
over
poured
from
a
bottle
into
a
pint
glass
beer
is
a
medium
transparent
amber
with
a
decent
enough
head
and
surprisingly
sticky
spotted
lacing
smell
is
malty
with
an
odd
funk
that
i
dont
have
the
words
to
describe
its
almost
like
a
belgian
yeast
that
missed
the
target
taste
lightly
malted
lightly
hopped
and
lightly
felt
there
just
isnt
much
going
on
here
i
almost
feel
that
the
hops
are
a
deterent
here
the
malts
seem
ok
not
great
but
the
hops
keep
them
from
showing
themselves
mouthfeel
is
watery
as
hell
and
undercarbonated
not
good
at
all
drinkability
hmm
im
not
sure
where
to
go
on
this
one
it
isnt
a
very
good
beer
but
it
is
a
very
drinkable
beer
in
the
same
way
that
water
is
drinkable
im
just
going
to
sit
the
fenceline
on
this
one
and
call
it
average
12
oz
bottle
expires
in
sept
06
pours
deep
yellow
with
a
hint
of
amber
very
clear
and
the
head
is
huge
smells
like
earthy
sorta
dirty
hops
with
a
slight
sulphur
whisp
taste
is
quite
dry
with
a
prominent
bitterness
but
not
a
lot
of
hop
taste
the
malts
are
a
little
crisp
and
bready
much
more
of
a
nut
overtone
than
i
would
expect
from
a
blonde
ale
but
entirely
to
be
expected
from
a
new
belgium
beer
not
my
favorite
beer
ever
but
its
sales
pitch
is
that
its
a
light
beer
and
in
that
context
its
pretty
damn
tasty
carbonation
is
relatively
low
which
lends
additional
lushness
to
the
mouthfeel
and
makes
it
quite
thirstquenching
this
is
easily
sessionable
but
a
little
less
sweetness
and
some
more
hop
would
make
said
session
more
interesting
a
fine
lawnmower
beer
for
me
and
well
worth
the
6
a
six
pack
or
so
that
nbb
have
been
charging
for
this
i
like
the
beer
a
lot
more
than
the
name
best
before
22
sept
06
pretty
light
body
not
overly
carbonated
its
light
goes
down
easy
but
for
me
its
just
not
that
compelling
mouthfeel
is
light
and
easy
to
drink
refreshing
but
not
too
very
interesting
the
beer
emigrates
from
the
12ounce
brown
bottle
a
luminous
gold
the
head
large
and
frothy
the
color
a
brilliant
white
as
it
fades
away
and
the
residual
lace
forms
a
thin
coating
upon
the
glass
nose
is
fresh
and
crisp
sweet
with
malt
very
light
musty
aroma
and
a
tiny
touch
of
hops
start
is
benign
in
its
sweetness
the
grain
profile
standard
and
the
top
light
to
moderate
in
feel
finish
is
prickly
in
its
acidity
the
hops
modest
in
their
spiciness
desert
bone
dry
aftertaste
a
decent
refreshing
beer
drinkability
drinkable
certainly
but
i
paid
7
for
a
sixer
of
this
at
that
price
theres
better
out
there
i
enjoy
trying
seasonal
brews
and
when
i
found
new
belgiums
summer
brew
i
got
a
little
excited
its
got
a
nice
amber
color
to
it
with
a
nice
frothy
white
head
that
gives
it
a
refreshing
appeal
however
once
taking
a
nose
i
felt
that
it
was
lacking
a
bit
in
the
aroma
dept
the
taste
is
pretty
good
good
citrusmalt
balance
which
was
expected
from
this
brewer
i
think
it
would
be
better
with
a
little
more
carbonation
as
for
drinkability
i
will
at
least
finish
the
sixpack
but
ive
had
better
summer
seasonals
overall
a
fairly
decent
summer
refreshment
the
body
is
light
and
i
carbonation
is
limited
the
beer
has
a
good
flavor
presence
as
there
wasnt
much
of
a
watery
taste
but
there
is
a
lot
going
on
that
clash
with
each
other
overall
ill
keep
my
overalls
on
poured
a
nice
coppery
color
from
a
12
oz
bottle
good
head
with
good
lacing
some
carbonation
hard
smell
for
me
to
nail
down
but
i
like
it
can
definitely
smell
the
lime
very
good
mouthfeel
and
great
taste
goes
down
very
smooth
and
while
maybe
not
quite
a
session
beer
i
can
drink
several
at
a
sitting
another
great
effort
from
new
belgium
4
hr
t
y
drinkability
is
excellent
this
would
make
a
perfect
hot
summer
saturday
session
beer
go
get
some
today
bottom
line
this
is
an
interesting
and
refreshing
session
brew
from
new
belgium
that
is
certainly
worth
trying
if
this
is
a
light
beer
its
the
best
one
out
there
surprising
its
not
more
aggressively
marketed
its
a
mediumly
hoppy
ale
with
a
twist
of
lime
and
while
that
may
make
bas
shudder
by
bringing
back
memories
of
corona
it
seems
to
work
here
the
aroma
is
hoppy
and
citric
and
while
the
flavor
doesnt
grab
the
finish
is
admirable
theres
some
puffy
cratered
lace
after
the
pour
and
the
hops
and
lime
flavors
recede
after
a
few
sips
but
the
nose
makes
the
beer
the
mouthfeel
is
a
bit
watery
doesnt
give
the
tongue
much
to
hang
on
to
but
drinkability
is
quite
high
id
recommend
this
beer
and
id
suggest
letting
it
get
a
fraction
warmer
than
the
45
degrees
new
belgium
prescribes
best
light
beer
ive
ever
had
hands
down
this
is
a
drinkable
beer
but
its
a
little
lighter
than
i
prefer
from
the
label
its
the
new
belgium
stab
at
the
light
beer
market
which
is
fine
but
im
not
much
of
a
buyer
in
that
market
i
probably
will
not
buy
skinny
dip
again
unless
im
looking
to
provide
a
light
offering
for
some
one
else
to
drink
it
might
be
a
good
crossover
beer
for
the
bmc
lite
crowd
i
guess
craft

can
be

this
beer
pored
from
the
bottle
a
medium
copper
color
very
clear
topped
by
a
great
fluffy
white
head
the
head
does
indeed
leave
a
lace
on
the
glass
as
it
recedes
the
nose
has
touches
of
the
kaffir
lime
leaves
and
a
slight
citrus
touch
from
the
hops
the
malt
follows
lightly
with
a
bit
of
caramel
the
taste
has
more
hop
than
i
expected
you
can
really
taste
the
mild
grapefruit
from
the
hop
addition
the
kaffir
lime
is
a
touch
more
subtle
than
i
expected
from
the
nose
the
caramel
from
the
malt
blends
nicely
and
gives
this
almost
a
candy
corn
flavor
the
mouth
feel
is
light
and
well
carbonated
this
is
yet
another
nice
summer
beer
notes
avoid
im
02
from
this
brewer
will
keep
trying
of
course
had
this
one
served
to
me
on
tap
at
old
chicago
in
omaha
not
the
best
place
for
reviewing
beer
but
i
was
bored
it
poured
with
a
large
billowing
head
even
from
the
bartender
who
always
seems
to
pour
a
flat
beer
the
smell
is
light
some
easy
breathing
grains
mixed
with
lemon
zest
and
some
other
citrus
notes
the
taste
is
off
of
what
i
had
expected
for
a
belgian
pale
very
grainy
very
smooth
a
nice
flavor
but
not
what
i
expected
at
all
the
mouthfeel
is
a
bit
watery
with
adequate
carbonation
but
not
matching
the
ginormous
head
overall
a
nice
offering
try
it
if
you
can
to
sum
this
up
with
one
word
wow
if
this
is
skinny
dipping
im
going
to
try
to
get
as
much
pool
time
as
i
can
good

great

session
brew
a

for

this
beer
was
disappointing
if
i
didnt
know
better
i
might
say
that
it
was
watered
down
i
cant
drink
2
of
these
all

no
substance
the
flavor
does
not
improve
as
the
beers
warms

probably
best
consumed

frigid

i
dont
believe
this

lives
up

standards
set
with

a

unique

was

went
with
a
heavyhanded
pour
and
sat
back
as
the
pseudocascade
happened
i
was
a
little
surprised
last
summer
when
the
old
lady
expressed
her
dismay
at
my
pouring
this
way
but
i
like
both
the
visual
and
the
release
of
esters
this
time
i
got
two
foamy
fingers
of
bonewhite
head
that
slowly
collapsed
on
itself
leaving
decent
lacing
in
its
wake
color

nose
was
very
malty
but
in
a
biscuit
malt
not
a
sweet
malt
way
bring
your
bare
ass
closer
honey
warming
it
also
began
to
take
on
a
honeylike
sweetness
and
now
it
was
time
for
a
sip
mouthfeel
was
mediumtofull
and
the
taste
was
very
biscuitlike
making
a
nice
counterpoint
to
the
earlier
blonde
finish
was
semidry
again
more
biscuit
malty
than
sweet
and
a
nice
choice
on
a
humid
summer
evening
o
overall
wasnt
to
impressed
at
first
but
the
pilsner
grain
backing
and
semidry
flowery
hops
soon
grows
on
you
coming
more
to
light
and
saving
this
from
a
mediocre
rating
i
just
had
bare
ass
blonde
for
the
first
time
at
a
beer
festival
and
really
enjoyed
it
it
has
a
golden
color
appropriate
for
a
blonde
ale
with
a
nice
creamy
white
head
and
a
subtle
malty
sweet
smell
bare
ass
blonde
pairs
very
well
with
a
multitude
of
foods
this
is
a
good
beer
to
serve
to
those
who
are
just
getting
into
the
craft
beer
scene
it
is
only
mildly
hopped
and
yet
is
a
full
bodied
brew
appears
honey
blonde
with
a
thin
white
head
forming
aroma
has
some
vegetal
notes
normally
found
in
some
malt
liquor
wow
im
still
loving
it
cereal
grains
slight
fruit
the
flavor
is
clean
drinking
beer
with
higher
alcohol
a
bit
of
cornvegetal
notes
saying
we
fermented
to
get
the
best
of
you
it
seems
higher
abv
than
your
average
blonde
overall
a
solid
blonde
ale
color
was
not
as
blonde
as
id
expect
from
the
style
not
overwhelmingly
hoppy
crisp
alelike
lemon
or
orange
finish
color
is
a
harvest
gold
and
the
aroma
is
a
deep
bouquet
of
woodsy
lemon
i
recommend
this
to
all
pale
ale
lovers
as
a
first
kiss
this
is
a
great
addition
to
my
stable
of
micro
brews
that
i
offer
customers
on
the
lower
eastern
shore
admittedly
this
beer
is
better
than
i
thought
it
was
going
to
be
with
a
name
like
bare
ass
decent
grain
tone
with
some
seemingly
orange
fruit
tone
going
on
as
well
carbonation
is
a
bit
high
and
full
but
just
a
bit
easy
enough
to
drink
i
wouldnt
go
back
to
it
but
it
turns
out
being
not
too
shabby
the
smell
is
faint
of
wheat
with
a
hint
of
lemon
the
taste
is
of
sweet
malt
and
s
hint
of
hops
a
light
hint
of
lemon
hits
the
back
of
the
tongue
mouthfeel
is
grest
and
oversll
s
good

beer
clean
lighte
pale
golden
in

some

over

this

to
a
jevers
can
see
light
beer
lovers
enjoying
this
brew
some
minor
blue
cheese
flavors
here
as
well
not
the
most
interesting
beer
that
they
brew
overall
well
worth
the
dollar
a
paid
its
a
very
easy
drinking
blonde
ale
this
is
a
medium
bodied
brew
with
a
modest
amoubt
of
carbonation
overall
pretty
standard
for
the
style
and
easy
drinking
but
it
is
otherwise
a
forgettable
blonde
ale
o
decent

offtap
this
beer
was
indeed
a
bright
blondegold
color
with
a
white
head
that
left
thin
bands
of
lacing
off
the
collar
the
aroma
was
faint
mostly
a
blend
of
sweet
malt
and
dry
grains
with
a
hint
of
hops
the
flavors
were
similar
i
tasted
the
fresh
dry
grainy
malt
predominantly
with
some
notes
of
bread
coupled
with
a
light
hops
presence
though
it
leaned
towards
the
sweet
side
of
the
spectrum
the
finish
was
crisp
and
clean
the
body
was
mediumlight
the
mouthfeel
a
little
above
average
and
the
carbonation
effervescent
the
beer
is
transparent
and
golden
yellow
hued
the
aroma
is
pretty
weak
offering
hints
of
sweet
malt
and
light
fruit
the
flavor
is
clean
but
pretty
bland
for
the
most
part
a
bit
of
light
toast
and
sweet
malt
light
grain
thin
bodied
easy
to
drink
moderately
low
carbonation
overall
drinkable
but
unexciting
beer
is
sweet
and
thin
with
a
mildly
grainy
bitterness
at
the
back
and
some
moderate
hop
flavor
earthy
and
piny
throughout
interesting
nice
beer
for
the
masses
but
ultimately
not
interested
overall
not
too
bad
this
beer
is
very
light
and
refreshing
should
be
good
for
the
hot
weather
coming
up
pours
a
golden
color
with
a
white
head
and
not
too
much

brings

mostly

with
some

grassy
character
light
body
with
good
carbonation
drinks
pretty
well
and
actually
has

was

very

crisp
could
have
had
a

these
if
the
weather

the
beer
poured
a
good
clear

the
aroma
was
of
malt
and
hops
but
was
very
light
the
taste
was
of
light
fruit
with
just
a
little
hops
the
feel
was
medium
and
wet
making
it
a
nice
thirst
quencher
this
was
a
nice
beer
that
would
do
for

low

its
clear
deepgold
bordering

amber
body
rests
beneath
a
short
lived
head
of
bright
white
foam
that
drops
to
a
thin
collar
and
leaves
little
if
any
lace
the
nose
is
clean
and
expresses
a
sweetish
strawlike
maltiness
with
a
slight
fruitiness
and
just
a
suggestion
of
hops
its
smooth
in
the
mouth
with
a
medium
body
and
a
gently
crisp
and
very
fine
median
carbonation
the
flavor
displays
a
grainy
malt
thats
straightforward
but
clean
and
balanced
towards
sweetness
its
clearly
an
ale
with
a
nice
bit
of
fruitiness
that
doesnt
go
overboard
and
it
finishes
dry
with
some
lingering
grainy
malt
it
offers
a
good
deal
of
drinkability
as
it
does
have
some
real
character
to
it
and
it
pairs
nicely
with
their
mesquite
chicken
roll
appetizers
this
is
my
favorite
fall
beer
and
in
my
top
three
favorite
beers
of
all
time
o
a
great
treat
after
a
day
of
golfing
in
the
searing
desert
heat
i
would
call
this
more
of
a
pale
than
a
blonde
ale
this
beer
was
sort
of
misleading
i
was
expecting
something
strong
and
outlandishly
hoppy
while
the
hops
definitely
hit
my
nose
the
taste
is
actually
pretty
tame
it
is
after
all
a
blonde
ale
the
hops
hit
you
up
front
but
it
goes
down
smooth
with
a
little
aftertaste
from
the
hops
its
actually
a
pretty
refreshing
autumn
beer
a
good
way
to
transition
from
the
crisp
summer
ones
into
the
typically
darker
warmer
beers
of
the
fall
this
is
a
blonde
ale
well
if
they
say
so
sure
heavy
malt
nose
is
followed
by
a
prickly
hop
spicyness
citrus
and
pine
dominate
for
the
most
part
this
is
a
nice
drinker
definitely
a
fall
blonde
ale

flanders
hoppy
o
i
really
enjoyed
this
beer
it
is
unlike
any
other
fall
seasonal
that
i
have
had
it
is
light
and
crisp
with
very
nice
citrusy
flavors
i
wouldnt
necessarily
have
this
on
a
colder
fall
day
but
it
is
pleasant
when
the
weather
is
still
warmish
my
favorite
new
belgium
brew
by
far
they
do
everything
right
with
this
one
great
appearance
a
tempting
golden
bubbly
brew
aroma
is
mixed
from
the
various
hop
usage
but
the
balanced
taste
is
where
its
all
at
balance
of
light
to
medium
malt
with
light
to
medium
hoppiness
is
very
impressive
you
get
great
doses
of
both
malt
and
hop
flavor
yet
feel
the
beer
is
light
to
medium
in
body
meaning
you
feel
up
for
drinking
the
entire
six
pack
or
twelve
pack
which
i
buy
every
fall
try
it
d
this
is
an
ok
beer
but
not
my
favorite
nbb
beer
3
notes
a
little
surprising
for
me
given
the
style
and
the
brewery
i
wasnt
expecting
a
whole
lot
fortunately
i
got
an
enjoyable
refreshing
beer
it
isnt
going
to
blow
anyone
away
but
is
going
to
be
a
simple
beer
i
could
drink
a
couple
of
and
enjoy
would
be
a
really
nice
introduction
beer
with
its
nice
balance
especially
for
introducing
to
hops
and
it
would
be
nice
for
nonintro
reasons
too
d
meh
i
found
this
beer
to
be
bland
and
boring
something
i
dont
think
id
try
again
this
is
a
rare
let
down
from
new
belgium
oh
well
maybe
next
time
d
very
easy
to
drink
i
could
drink
this
beer
all
day
and
all
night
for
the
rest
of
my
life
d
good
beer
overall
not
over
the
top
hoppy
can
drink
a
few
of
these
in
a
row
md
light
bodied
crisp
carbonation
with
a
slightly
bitter
finish
the
flavor
is
nice
and
it
would
be
easy
to
drink
alot
of
this
d
ill
have
another
fairly
drinkable
but
satisfying
enough
to
enjoy
just
one
one
of
the
best
ive
had
of
this
style
love
the
hop
profile
and
the
malt
is
actually
what
makes
this
a
winner
the
burps
taste
like
leafy
green
hops
top
of
the
line
this
is
a
well
done
blonde
i
really
enjoyed
the
hop
level
and
found
it
quite
drinkable
relatively
light
not
overpowering
with
nice
hops
as
well
not
a
hop
bomb
just
a
nice
ale
similar
to
pale
ale
in
the
mouth
with
bitter
finish
finish
leaves
me
wanting
just
a
bit
more
but
a
solid
beer
for
regular
drinking
definitely
one
of
the
better
examples
of
the
style
that
ive
encountered
thus
far
big
and
hoppy
but
still
light
and
easy
to
drink
a
very
nice
bridge
or
leadin
to
the
coming
winter
and
its
warming
requirements
beer
or
otherwise
pours
a
rich
golden
yellow
color
and
a
thick
cloudlike
eggshellcolored
head
the
aroma
is
dominated
by
pine
and
earth
hop
characteristics
with
maybe
a
little
lemon
creeping
in
as
well
the
flavor
is
likewise
primarily
driven
by
a
dull
earthy
hop
character
up
front
with
a
bit
of
peppery
spice
all
balanced
by
a
comparatively
subtle
nutty
sweetness
finely
carbonated
this
one
is
easy
to
drink
but
not
special
in
that
regard
although
it
is
noted
that
it
tastes
lighter
than
i
would
have
expected
for
6
alcohol
overall
it
is
a
solid
hopforward
golden
ale
d
suited
for
the
major
hopsters
i
enjoyed
this
beer
but
if
you
dont
like
bitter
beer
this
may
not
be
for
you
d
nice
beer
didnt
knock
my
socks
off
and
feels
a
bit
heavy
for
numerous
helpings
but
i
didnt
regret
the
purchase
the
best
bottles
of
this
ive
had
approach
gumballhead
its
not
quite
there
but
its
easier
for
me
to
get
and
i
know
it
will
be
fresh
an
easy
beer
for
me
to
pick
up
annually
if
it
continues
to
be
like
this
overall
the
taste
really
skyrockets
this
into
a
notable
state
for
me
one
of
my
favorite
new
belgiums
ever
i
would
recommend
this
to
anyone
looking
for
a
good
semidark
ale
d
wasnt
expecting
a
whole
lot
from
the
beer
actually
enjoyed
the
couple
that
i
had
im
more
inclined
to
try
some
of
their
other
seasonal
beers
now
too
i
really
dont
know
a
ton
about
the
style
but
this
is
a
home
run
well
carbonated
pleasant
the
taste
definitely
grows
on
you
you
can
taste
more
flavors
as
you
drink
i
thoroughly
enjoyed
this
beer
would
drink
my
fair
share
of
it
were
it
available
to
me
well
done
new
belgium
well
done
this
is
an
easily
quaffable
ale
with
layers
of
complexity
aplenty
in
both
the
aroma
taste
drinkability
overall
pretty
good
crisp
nice
hop
profile
the
malt
choices
were
interesting
albeit
a
little
scattered
wasnt
thrilled
but
i
still
enjoyed
it
a
good
deal
nothing
too
special
but
an
alright
beer
that
tries
to
cross
an
oktoberfest
with
a
hoppier
lighter
ale
d
this
is
definitely
a
solid
nb
seasonal
thats
simplicity
is
what
makes
it
great
drinkability
this
is
a
crisp
fairly
bitter
beer
but
the
hops
dont
have
as
much
taste
or
complexity
as
i
would
have
hoped
at
least
it
doesnt
have
that
damn
biscuity
fat
tire
taste
that
most
of
their
americanstyle
beers
do
for
a
blonde
ale
this
has
some
nice
character
this
is
a
greeat
session
brew
if
you
dont
let
the
heavy
carbonation
get
to
ya
i
could
session
this
brew
once
a
week
give
it
a
try
d
easy
to
down
this
by
the
six
pack
felt
like
a
fall
seasonal
had
surprisingly
few
options
and
settled
on
this
pours
a
bright
gold
with
a
just
slightly
off
white
head
head
is
creamy
and
recedes
slowly
leaving
some
thick
lacing
the
nose
on
this
is
incredibly
potent
lost
of
biscuity
malts
up
front
with
some
nice
faint
hop
aromas
to
compliment
unfortunately
after
the
nose
the
taste
is
a
bit
subtle
and
kind
of
a
let
down
but
seems
appropriate
for
the
style
malty
up
front
with
noble
hops
in
the
finish
some
nice
sweet
honey
notes
as
well
mouthfeel
is
a
little
disappointing
kind
of
thin
and
watery
overall
a
solidvery
drinkable
beer
not
really
sure
why
this
is
a
fall
seasonal
thought
doesnt
feel
very
fall
like
beermail
me
if
there
is
something
obvious
im
missing
that
makes
this
a
fall
brew
quite
drinkable
paired
great
with
chicken
wings
mouthfeeldrinkability
light
bodied
crisp
and
refreshing
and
not
overly
carbonated
which
is
a
nice
plus
nice
drinkable
beer
that
actually
has
some
flavor
light
yellow
to
gold
color
with
half
inch
frothy
head
medium
floral
aroma
taste
had
an
assertive
hoppy
bitterness
up
front
that
smooth
out
and
left
with
a
mildly
bitter
finish
body
was
light
to
medium
and
was
very
drinkable
an
excellent
ale
for
early
fall
and
very
refreshing
here
in
the
warm
south
wish
it
was
released
in
the
summer
but
it
is
a
nice
alternative
to
the
traditional
fest
beers
drinks
i
like
what
new
belgium
has
been
doing
with
hops
lately
but
im
not
sure
this
one
fits
with
the
fall
seasonal
theme
it
also
seems
to
me
a
little
overhopped
for
an
american
blonde
still
its
not
bad
d
another
mediocre
brew
from
a
mediocre
brewery
fairly
average
except
maybe
appearance
would
be
good
with
food
or
at
a
barbeque
i
have
to
say
im
impressed
with
this
of
the
new
belgium
ive
had
this
may
be
the
best
very
good
fall
beer
i
poured
this
beer
into
an
oktoberfest
mug
it
pours
a
nice
orange
golden
color
with
the
slightest
lacing
if
a
white
head
the
nose
is
nice
and
hoppy
with
exceptionally
balanced
sweet
manliness
this
is
an
exceptional
oktober
offering
really
well
balanced
with
out
being
overly
mary
like
most
oktober
offerings
i
wish
this
beer
was
on
tap
for
more
oktoberfest
events
it
is
a
great
offering
d
i
feel
that
this
does
not
stand
a
chance
for
a
autumn
brew
too
light
and
lacking
up
front
flavors
while
it
goes
down
easy
and
if
need
be
i
could
drink
plenty
of
this
brew
there
are
many
other
offering
that
i
would
choose
oh
why
new
belgium
this
style
for
a
fall
seasonal
poured
from
bottle
into
new
belgium
tulip
color
is
golden
with
a
fizzy
white
head
and
some
nice
lacing
but
kind
of
ho
hum
smell
is
nothing
i
expected
for
a
golden
ale
very
hop
forward
an
amazing
combination
of
grassy
and
tropical
fruit
notes
some
sweet
mint
in
the
background
a
touch
of
sugary
malt
sweetness
taste
is
similar
to
the
smell
tropical
fruits
up
front
some
malty
sweet
notes
and
grassy
bitterness
in
the
finish
not
a
perfect
balance
but
it
tastes
great
a
wonderful
display
of
hops
without
being
overly
bitter
mouthfeel
is
lightly
carbonated
and
slightly
sticky
could
have
a
cleaner
finish
drinkability
is
great
not
overly
bitter
not
overly
sweet
not
too
high
abv
the
only
downside
to
this
is
the
hops
has
faded
significantly
since
the
first
6
pack
i
bought
still
a
great
beer
one
of
the
best
new
belgium
has
ever
offered
and
by
far
the
best
blonde
ale
ive
ever
had
this
is
an
interesting
autumn
seasonal
while
most
of
them
are
either
oktoberfest
or
pumpkin
ales
this
one
ends
up
being
one
of
the
most
hoppy
beers
in
the
nb
lineup
its
not
a
bad
beer
but
people
have
to
be
in
the
mood
for
something
resembling
an
ipa
to
enjoy
it
we
cant
get
new
belgium
in
pennsylvania
and
that
is
a
shame
thanks
to
simon
for
bringing
the
beer
over
for
tasting
at
the
after
big
pour
4
hangout
oh
yeah
and
his
cousin
for
bringing
it
up
from
sc
yes
i
stashed
a
couple
so
i
could
do
a
review
proper
aftertaste
is
so
smooth
and
drying
very
very
nice
d
highly
drinkable
apv
is
not
enough
to
make
this
something
that
couldnt
be
enjoyed
over
multiple
pints
with
good
company
and
a
nice
cigar
drinkability
isnt
the
greatest
due
to
the
huge
fruity
flavor
this
has
also
it
doesnt
finish
as
crisp
as
id
like
but
on
the
whole
a
very
decent
beer
d
after
seeing
what
direction
new
belgium
took
ranger
ipa
in
this
beer
seems
to
be
cut
from
similar
cloth
the
overall
sensory
theme
appears
the
same
but
here
the
sensory
volume
is
dialed
back
this
is
a
solid
and
versatile
summer
pale
ale
not
to
mention
a
fine
counterpoint
to
fat
tire
drinkability
good
nb
actually
did
a
good
job
on
pretty
much
every
aspect
of
this
beer
except
the
labeling
fire
the
guy
who
decided
this
was
a
golden
ale
and
that
it
should
be
released
in
the
fall
this
beer
is
very
tasty
i
expected
a
marzen
this
is
more
of
a
pale
ale
after
a
rough
day
of
disappointment
after
disappointment
this
hit
the
spot
i
dont
believe
my
judgment
is
askew
because
of
that
but
what
if
it
is
good
beer
can
make
a
bad
day
good
again
and
then
bad
again
if
you
let
yourself
get
all
fuckered
up
anyway
this
is
pure
simplicity
without
any
hohum
elements
i
like
o
solid
offering
from
new
belgium
best
one
ive
had
to
date
outside
of
bomber
offerings
a
wellbalanced
american
blonde
seasonal
with
lots
of
interesting
interplay
between
hops
and
malts
find
it
while
its
still
on
tap
dneed
to
buy
a
sixer
of
this
d
this
is
a
very
drinkable
beer
this
could
be
a
year
round
brew
or
at
the
very
least
available
during
summer
and
fall
pours
a
transparent
golden
color
with
a
one
finger
white
head
smell
is
of
citrus
hops
with
a
little
malt
in
there
too
taste
is
pretty
complex
some
pine
citrus
and
grassy
hops
there
are
some
malts
in
there
too
grainy
taste
finish
is
tasty
not
too
bitter
mouthfeel
is
light
with
good
carbonation
overall
its
a
refreshing
beer
very
tasty
i
love
marzenoctoberfest
brews
but
this
was
a
nice
break
in
the
trend
very
good
definitely
a
beer
i
will
seek
out
again
next
fall
d
this
beer
was
a
ok
at
best
nothing
that
i
would
really
want
to
spend
my
money
on
the
lack
of
alcohol
taste
in
the
beer
made
it
super
drinkable
although
this
beer
might
just
be
a
little
old
so
ill
try
it
again
from
a
place
that
i
know
keeps
their
beer
rotated
d
lets
just
say
i
wont
be
having
this
again
its
way
too
fruity
and
flowery
especially
for
a
fall
seasonal
try
spring
boys
md
nb
has
surprised
me
again
this
isnt
a
one
dimensional
beer
due
to
the
genius
selection
of
hops
used
even
though
theres
hop
in
the
name
this
doesnt
kill
your
palate
with
bitterness
hoptober
would
be
a
great
addition
to
their
year
round
lineup
appearance
is
a
cloudy
light
blonde
with
a
14
head
with
minimal
lacing
light
hop
aroma
with
toasty
biscuit
malt
carbonation
is
ideal
for
the
style
and
the
first
taste
is
citrus
with
a
hint
of
peppery
spice
finishes
with
a
moderate
lingering
bitterness
drinkability
was
less
than
expected
but
would
be
able
to
have
two
or
three
in
a
row
at
the
most
it
has
been
a
year
since
i
first
had
it
on
draft
and
is
pretty
much
as
i
remember
it
a
solid
beer
that
i
would
happily
drink
on
a
cool
fall
day
this
is
a
very
good
blond
nice
color
nice
aroma
and
nice
flavor
more
of
a
warm
weather
beer
than
what
you
expect
for
the
fall
but
good
to
sit
back
with
and
watch
a
game
best
of
the
new
belgiums
in
my
opinion
drinking
from
the
bottle
and
poured
it
in
a
glass
skimpy
on
the
hops
but
overall
a
nice
and
smooth
palate
i
have
to
put
this
up
as
one
of
my
favorite
however
i
am
patial
to
blonds
beautifully
balanced
and
drinkable
beer
normally
id
see
this
as
a
fantastic
summer
beer
but
the
unorthodox
release
time
does
nothing
t
take
away
from
what
it
is
which
is
a
tasty
lightbodied
beer
that
goes
great
with
a
huge
variety
of
food
d
this
is
a
solid
beer
however
not
what
i
was
expecting
i
was
thinking
hoppy
octoberfest
and
i
feel
this
is
more
like
a
lighter
apa
i
should
have
known
this
since
the
beer
is
an
ale
and
not
a
lager
this
is
a
nice
fruity
ale
and
at
6
and
40ibu
will
not
not
kill
you
to
drink
a
few
d
a
solid
beer
but
nothing
like
a
traditional
oktoberfest
clearly
an
ale
with
the
fruitiness
and
has
a
definite
american
influence
a
crowd
pleaser
for
a
fall
party
if
you
are
looking
for
a
traditional
oktoberfest
this
beer
is
not
for
you
this
blonde
ale
is
great
for
the
warmer
falls
of
texas
which
is
surprising
considering
it
is
brewed
in
colorado
if
you
are
looking
to
break
away
from
the
oktoberfest
glut
in
sept
and
oct
this
is
the
beer
for
you
while
many
other
breweries
are
rolling
out
their
marzens
new
belgium
clings
to
the
final
shreds
of
summer
with
this
bright
hoppy
blonde
ale
d
new
belgiums
beers
are
sort
of
hit
or
miss
for
me
and
blonde
ales
are
not
really
my
favorite
but
this
was
quite
enjoyable
id
happily
have
this
one
again
i
like
this
better
than
last
years
fall
seasonal
from
new
belgium
purchased
in
a
folly
pack
probably
the
most
solid
12
pack
youll
find
at
a
grocery
store
and
poured
into
a
12oz
mug
hoptober
is
as
advertised
hoppy
but
not
too
hoppy
or
too
anything
for
that
matter
in
it
are
hints
of
dry
citrus
and
fairly
medium
hops
with
a
decent
amount
of
carbonation
that
adds
an
initial
sharpness
to
the
beer
as
with
many
beers
from
new
belgium
this
beer
tastes
of
good
ingredients
and
modest
aims
for
what
it
is
and
more
importantly

hoptober
is
pretty
darn
good
this
is
a
nice
change
for
oktoberfest
and
autumn
while
this
is
not
very
complex
it
is
extremely
drinkable
and
refreshing
it
fits
the
bill
for
a
fest
ale
its
not
a
bad
beer
to
drink
but
the
flavors
are
pretty
stout
and
like
i
said
i
didnt
feel
they
went
very
well
together
it
has
great
lacing
however
d
this
is
a
nice
beer
overall
its
fairly
light
and
goes
down
easily
ill
be
revisiting
this
when
it
comes
back
around
next
year
picked
up
as
part
of
a
mixed
six
pack
last
week
on
a
whim
poured
a
light
golden
color
with
a
huge
white
head
that
poured
over
the
sides
light
hoppy
aroma
with
similar
hops
on
the
palate
along
with
a
little
sweet
malt
decent
but
ultimately
forgettable
this
is
a
great
seasonal
offering
especially
if
the
prospect
of
a
moderatelyhopped
complex
golden
ale
sounds
up
your
alley
drinkability
this
was
a
very
easy
to
drink
refreshing
crisp
but
round
and
full
bodied
beer
certainly
interesting
and
worth
a
try
2010
bottle
pours
a
clear
golden
color
very
bubbly
with
a
large
white
frothy
head
smells
of
a
lot
of
hops
and
some
wheat
im
digging
the
scent
on
it
very
subtle
yet
intriguing
taste
is
initially
a
sweet
malty
flavor
with
some
definite
rye
notes
then
you
get
the
hop
flavors
not
very
bitter
but
hoppy
at
the
same
time
at
the
end
you
get
some
caramel
and
some
very
delightful
fruitiness
the
mouthfeel
is
very
crisp
and
refreshing
a
perfect
beer
for
a
warm
summer
night
the
drinkability
is
very
high
d
easy
to
drink
surprised
its
at
6
would
go
great
with
a
volleyball
game
dont
drink
blonde
ales
much
but
probably
my
favorite
in
awhile
of
the
style
medium
bodied
soft
finish
starts
big
and
brash
ends
smooth
and
quiet
the
mouthfeel
is
to
me
the
best
part
of
this
bearing
down
on
the
tongue
with
ample
hops
and
effervescence
that
stand
up
nicely
overall
a
very
good
hoppedup
golden
ale
that
is
a
nice
change
of
pace
from
the
normal
marzen
and
fall
lineupwhich
i
also
love
good
stuff
this
is
my
ideal
hotmild
weather
beer
the
bear
looks
amazing
in
a
glass
its
golden
and
clear
with
a
good
thick
long
lasting
head
the
aroma
is
a
nice
bouquet
of
hop
grassy
and
citrus
the
taste
to
quote
the
lonely
island
jizzed
in
my
pants
yeah
its
really
that
good
starts
with
wonderful
blend
of
hop
and
stays
all
the
way
through
good
balance
of
malt
and
bitter
a
wonderful
vessel
for
hop
flavor
i
think
this
should
be
their
summer
release
and
their
autumnoktoberfest
should
be
something
a
little
darker
but
hey
thats
just
me
it
will
transition
you
from
a
great
summer
into
the
perfect
uncertainty
that
those
late
summer
months
will
bring
the
hop
profile
is
very
similar
to
mighty
arrow
the
rye
and
wheat
does
something
for
the
texture
here
that
makes
it
a
pretty
good
golden
very
good
easy
drinking
one
of
the
better
beer
from
new
belgium
go
try
this
one
out
but
dont
wait
for
the
calendar
to
tell
you
when
it
is
time
go
now
this
just
earned
a
spot
on
my
favorite
list
superb
cheers
pours
clear
with
a
thin
lacy
head
nice
fresh
hoppy
smell
slight
hoppy
taste
reminds
me
more
of
a
pale
ale
creamy
mouthfeel
and
nice
and
light
and
crisp
sometimes
it
is
nice
to
drink
a
beer
that
will
not
make
you
feel
full
and
bloated
this
is
a
great
beer
if
you
are
looking
to
sit
back
and
relax
with
a
group
of
friends
despite
my
scores
i
really
like
this
beer
another
one
that
reaches
a
little
beyond
the
style
but
i
really
like
the
taste
of
this
one
not
too
bland
like
many
a
golden
ale
i
have
tried
poured
into
pint
glass
almost
yellow
in
color
with
creamy
white
head
great
retention
and
lacing
smell
is
great
with
some
citrusy
hops
pineapple
and
sweet
malt
taste
is
about
the
same
a
sweeter
malt
taste
at
first
then
a
definite
citrus
kick
really
has
a
pineapple
taste
i
swear
with
a
little
orange
hops
are
definitely
there
as
well
and
add
a
nice
balance
to
the
initial
sweetness
mouthfeel
was
light
and
slightly
oily
thanks
to
the
hops
very
smooth
though
overall
a
great
beer
and
quite
honestly
perhaps
my
favorite
from
new
belgium
yet
d

not
that
i
would
go
to
lengths
to

it
out

the
right
situation
great
golden
ale
overall
this
is
one
of
the
better
beers
ive
had
from
new
belgium
recently
the
brew
is
a
little
hoppy
at
first
and
then
the
nice
sweetness
of
cereal
grains
kicks
in
and
finishes
quite
clean
to
leave
the
palate
satisfied
d
a
strong
summer
beer
nice
flavorwise
with
a
killer
aroma
for
a
blonde
ale
it
kicks

good
for

summer
sitting
on

porch
drink
is
very
high
for
this
one
a
very
nice
fall

d
this
lightbodied
beer
seems
more
appropriate
for

summertime
but
is
damned
tasty
and
refreshing
any
time
of
the
year
mouthfeel
is
mediumlight
with
a
crisp
amount
of
carbonation
d
very
drinkable
although
in
my
humble
opinion
rather
unexciting
i
certainly
dont
mind
drinking
it
but
i
dont
plan
on
running
out
to
get
more
any
time
soon
tasty
beer
i
would
buy
more
if
it
were
available
to
me
overall
a
really
really
well
done
beer
and
a
new
favorite
from

for

d
not
great
despite

and

the

so
far
so
good
on
the
new
belgiums
as
far
as
i
am
concerned
a
good
solid
brew
darn
near
dangerous
drinkability
the
flavors
are
unique
and
will
not
leave
you
bored
the
taste
isnt
overbearing
and
nicely
refreshing
i
would
pair
this
with
a
healthy
plate
of
pasta
and
chicken
with
a
white
sauce
i
am
quite
disappointed
because
nb
is
one
of
my
favorite
breweriesespecially
for
the
belgian
styles
i
was
hoping
for
something
really
flavorful
and
delicious
i
wasnt
sure
what
to
expect
i
had
it
in
my
mind
that
it
might
be
a
little
bit
like
duvelwhich
is
delicious
but
unfortunately
this
beer
misses
the
mark
sorry
nb
ill
still
buy
plenty
of
abbey
trippel
and
1554
but
i
wont
be
picking
up
this
one
again
poured
a
golden
color
with
a
creamy
head
that
left
nice
lacing
on
the
glass
the
color
made
me
think
this
was
not
going
to
pack
the
flavor
it
did
it
had
a
nice
citrus
flavor
with
the
hop
bite
being
present
but
not
overwhelming
very
balanced
and
easy
to
drink
you
could
have
several
of
these
and
enjoy
each
one
pours
a
pale
copper
with
a
thin
beige
head
nose
has
floral
hops
over
candy
malts
and
spices
taste
is
also
on
the
hoppy
side
for
a
marzen
but
still
has
some
nice
malt
characteristics
body
is
a
bit
light
but
well
carbonated
i
like
the
addition
of
extra
hops
to
the
style
but
would
also
like
to
see
a
stronger
base
beer
a
good
beer
on
a
cool
fall
evening
maybe
paired
with
a
chili
dog
watching
the
world
series
otherwise
pleasantly
surprised
with
the
contrast
this
beer
poses
to
other
fall
seasonals
d
this
is
a
very
unique
beer
somewhere
between
an
apa
and
ipa
with
a
little
too
much
strength
alcohol
and
hops
for
a
blonde
ale
in
my
opinion
its
quite
wonderful
when
youre
in
the
mood
for
hops
and
quite
sessionable
to
a
certain
degree
d
i
enjoyed
this
one
though
its
hoppier
than
any
other
blonde
ale
that
i
remember
drinking
id
probably
call
it
a
pale
ale
but
whatever
it
is
i
liked
it
the
flavor
is
clean
and
fresh
and
i
could
easily
drink
a
few
pale
yellow
clear
with
a
larrgish
frothy
white
head
nice
fresh
hop
aromas
from
this
one
smells
at

way
above

a

slightly

goodness
in
the

adding
to

i
liked
the
palate
on
this
it
is
light
but
not
really
highly
carbonated
very
drinkable
good
golden
ale
overall
a
decent
beer
and
a
nice
celebration
of
hops
and
their
varied
characteristics
nicely
drinkable
the
dry
finish
leaves
one
reaching
for
more
simple
tasty
and
satisfying
overall
impression
definitely
a
drinkable
offering
i
tried
this
on
draft
and
wasnt
impressed
but
im
really
enjoying
the
six
pack
so
maybe
it
was
my
taste
buds
or
the
lines
or
something
d
a
good
beer
overall
i
would
drink
this
any
day
it
is
a
nice
between
beer
something
for
when
i
want
hops
but
not
as
much
as
a
pale
ale
or
ipa
good
balance
and
a
pretty
good
gateway
beer
its
a
little
thinner
than
i
would
like
but
easily
drinkable
a
nice
change
of
pace
from
sweeter
maltier
fall
seasonals
d
it
was
good
but
i
would
have
liked
it
better
without
the
hops
clear
golden
with
a
creamy
eggshell
head
of
different
sized
bubbles
that
lasts
awhile
and
leaves
fine
lacing
on
the
glass
the
nose
is
fresh
with
piney
hop
and
caramel
malt
nice
mild
hop
forward
flavors
are
balanced
with
toasty
malt
the
oats
impart
a
smooth
mouthfeel
on
this
one
an
easy
drinker
i
dig
it
creamy
and
easy
to
drink
hoptober
is
a
beers
beer
it
has
perfect
amounts
of
ingredients
and
is
very
well
balanced
an
absolute
pleasure
to
drink
and
one
that
goes
down
smooth
and
finishes
strong
not
bad
at
all
i
can
see
the
appeal
for
this
beer
it
just
does
not
do
a
lot
for
me
this
really
is
worth
a
try
though
d
much
better
than
i
thought
it
would
be
definately
sessionable
im
glad
i
got
this
included
as
an
extra
in
a
trade
solid
beer

well
with
chips
and
bean
dip

6pm
on

day

was
a
small
white
head
on
it
that
dropped
off
rather
quickly
but
left
a
bit
of
lacing
the
aroma
is
rather
decent
there
is
a
lot
going
on
in
this
one
some
citrus
and
pine
hop
notes
up
front
also
some
grassiness
and
malts
in
the
background
a
mild
hop
bite
to
the
taste
medium
bodied
some
malts
and
earthiness
to
the
taste
also
pretty
easy
drinking
not
bad
at

overall
i
love

from
nb
this
one
is
up
there
very
drinkable
and
something
i
would
buy
to
impress
my
friends
cheers
i
found
this
quite
drinkable
a
very
good
brew
for
when
the
temperatures
drop
had
hopes
that
this
might
actually
be
a
well
hopped
offering
from
nb
for
once
you
would
think
calling
it
hoptober
that
it
might
actually
have
a
hop
kick
to
it
but
it
didnt
would
not
recommend
to
anyone
this
is
nice
beer
a
good
change
of
pace
from
oktoberfests
and
harvest
ales
im
impressed
probably
will
pick
up
some
more
before
it
leaves
for
the
year
with

and
this
they
have

seasonals
id
probably
get

subtle
blend
of
citrus
hops
and
pale
malts
with
a
nice
subtle
lingering
sweetness
the
beer
is
on
the
light
side
of
medium
with
decent
carbonation
this
is
certainly
an
interesting
beer
one
that
would
also
be
good
in
summer

damn

great
session
beer
doesnt
live
up
to
the
name
imho
this
is
a
good
bbq
beer
that
might
help
bmc
people
get
into
craft
i
wouldnt
turn
this
one
down
but
plays
so
well
with
the
other
flavors
mouthfeel
is
lighttomedium
bodied
with
moderate
carbonation
sterling
i
enjoyed
this
beer

relatively
smooth
all
the
way
very
piney
now
that
its
in
the
mouth
i
mean
its
worth
a
shot

and
they
add
they
inimitatable
glossy
beefy
slickness
in
the
feel
yet
this
still
drinks
with
abandon
with
its
sparkling
carbonation
this
shows
a
fantastic
amount
of
complexity
on
its
smallish
frame
i
think
youll
be
as
happy
with
it

this

that
this

sipper
quality

brew
from

a
little
suprisingly
considering
the
appearance
highly
drinkable
and
very
unique
for

this
has
the
fruity
belgian
blonde
ale
characteristics
notes
of
ripe
peaches
are
prevalent
but
as
long
as
its
on
the
shelf
as
this
is
more
of
a
summer
beer
in
my
opinion
but
it
definitely
exceeded
my
expectations

i
found
hoptober
pretty
light
and
refreshing
not
what
i
expected
from
a
beer
labeled
as
a
golden
ale
or
from
an
autumn
release
d
simple
pretty
tasty
and
easy
to
drink
o
very
light
very
refreshing
love
the
art
on
the
label
great
bottle
from
new
belgium
as
always
great
name
that
suits
the
brew
good
refreshing
summer
beer
got
it
in
nc
drinking
it
in
china
poured
from
a
brown
12
oz
bottle
has
a
deep
golden
color
with
a
12
inch
head
smell
is
sweet
floral
some
citrus
taste
is
citrus
malts
a
bit
sweet
very
easy
drinking
and
refreshing
feels
medium
bodied
in
the
mouth
and
overall
is
a
solid
beer
taste
is
soft
light
sweetness
with
light
herbal
grassy
bitterness
stronger
at
finish
peaches
hay
up
front
long
graincrackerpeach
finish
with
hint
of
mineral
water
this
is
a
light
bodied
brew
with
a
moderate
amount
of
carbonation
it
is
easily
drinking
but
with
a
bit
of
an
exaggerated
coriander
and
lemony
feel
that
i
just
didnt
dig
all
that
much
for
a
summertime
offering
yeah
i
could
see
throwing
a
few
of
these
back
without
much
effort
but
it
isnt
something
i
would
pick
if
i
was
given
options
d
not
bad
for
what
it
is
though
it
is
an
odd
one
the
tartness
is
refreshing
but
the
apricot
flavor
isnt
to
my
liking
overall
this
is
certainly
drinkable
and
different
in
good
ways
wouldnt
say
i
love
it
but
can
appreciate
is
appeal
perfect
keep
your
edge
stuff
for
disc
golf
barbecues
tailgates
etc
o
i
prefer
more
complex
brews
that
have
a
bigger
body
i
was
given
this
by
a
family
member
so
i
am
very
grateful
to
have
tried
it
it
would
be
a
nice
brew
for
anyone
first
starting
out
in
the
microcraft
brew
world
it
provides
a
nice
touch
of
simplicity
yet
at
the
same
time
adds
a
few
characters
to
help
the
palate
grow
really
nice
lacing
over
a
golden
body
with
the
a
tiny
tiny
bit
of
haze
the
look
of
it
is
great
nice
lemony
grassy
taste
and
smell
this
is
a
very
refreshing
summer
ale
im
having
it
in
the
wet
fall
right
now
and
its
still
almost
perfect
but
in
the
hot
sun
this
one
would
be
spot
on
oa
boring
bland
beer
this
did
nothing
for
me
i
could
drink
it
again
but
i
have
no
reason
to
4
435
00
pours
a
slightly
darker
golden
color
nose
is
of
hops
lemon
and
a
bit
of
a
floral
vibe
overall
taste
follows
with
a
touch
of
other
fruit
like
apricot
as
a
summer
beer
i
think
this
one
lacks
the
crispness
and
refreshing
qualities
that
i
personally
desire
its
a
little
busier
than
most
of
my
sumemr
favorites
but
given
the
more
pedestrian
nature
of
new
belgiums
line
fat
tire
ranger
etc
i
do
appreciate
the
uniqueness
here
o
an
excellent
highly
drinkable
summer
beer
clean
light
and
refreshing
serving
type
bottle
overall
was
impressed
with
this
not
being
a
big
new
belgium
guy
very
good
summer
beer
not
as
good
as
some
of
the
pale
wheat
ales
but
it
holds
its
own
for
summer
beer
od
a
nice
summer
blonde
ale
lots
of
different
fruity
notes
than
the
typical
citrus
and
really
easy
drinking
this
is
a
pretty
decent
beer
not
close
to
the
best
beer
out
of
the
new
belgium
brewery
but
certainly
in
the
upper
half
of
what
ive
had
from
this
fort
collins
brewery
it
definately
tastes
better
out
of
the
tap
it
has
a
not
too
hoppy
taste
but
quite
enjoyable
its
almost
as
if
theres
more
citrus
notes
than
it
being
a
super
hoppy
beer
i
prefer
it
over
shift
1554
and
would
place
it
right
around
fat
tire
as
far
as
quality
of
taste
though
they
are
completely
different
tastes
o
exceptional
i
will
and
have
bought
this
frequently
love
this
beer
picked
this
up
from
the
grocery
store
and
was
pleasantly
surprised
at
how
good
it
is
appearance
and
mouthfeel
are
average
but
the
smell
and
taste
were
very
flavorful
lots
of
fruit
without
being
sweet
spice
yeast
and
lemon
make
this
a
refreshing
summer
beer
id
have
this
one
again
and
again
pours
golden
with
a
really
nice
white
head
that
clings
to
the
glass
aroma
is
very
malty
with
a
hint
of
citrus
wow
flavor
is
not
what
i
expected
at
all
again
malty
but
like
a
whole
grain
cracker
with
no
sweetness
the
hops
make
their
presence
known
with
a
lime
note
in
the
finish
while
this
is
an
ale
it
reminds
me
more
of
a
pilsner
and
is
equally
drinkable
on
this
hot
texas
afternoon
i
wish
i
had
a
sixer
of
this
very
very
easy
to
drink
definitely
one
for
those
lawn
chair
days
o
very
drinkable
an
interesting
balance
of
citrus
and
bitterness
that
pushes
the
malt
bill
to
the
background
it
has
excellent
lacing
could
easily
put
away
2
or
3
on
a
lazy
afternoon
4
5
pours
a
clear
golden
yellow
with
a
white
head
a
nice
bright
smooth
aroma
a
little
grainy
with
big
and
kinda
sweet
and
juicy
lemon
aroma
flavor
followed
suit
a
nice
medium
bodied
and
active
mouthfeel
overall
i
was
really
surprised
by
this
and
quite
enjoyed
it
a
very
nice
summer
beer
enjoyable
easygoing
o
decently
drinkable
for
a
summer
ale
but
overall
very
underwhelming
overall
a
very
pleasant
surprise
to
find
in
the
grocery
store
great
belgian
style
blonde
ale
delicious
mouthfeel
is
creamy
and
smooth
with
mild
zesty
carbonation
thats
refreshing
and
easy
to
drink
with
a
mediumlight
body
a
summer
beer
with
flavor
that
goes
down
easy
and
was
perfect
on
a
hot
summer
night
well
done
another
winner
by
new
belgium
d
a
successful
summer
seasonal
light
and
fruity
fresh
easy
summer
drinking
this
was
pretty
good
it
definitely
had
a
crisp
and
quaffable
nature
to
it
but
didnt
get
over
sharp
or
aggressive
feeling
either
between
this
and
the
dig
pale
ale
i
think
new
belgium
has
two
of
the
better
warm
weather
beers
that
ive
had
lately
o
a
great
easy
drinking
summer
beer
that
has
a
fairly
big
flavor
new
belgium
came
into
my
area
about
a
year
ago
and
i
have
been
looking
for
a
regular
beer
that
lives
up
to
the
bar
that
the
lips
of
faith
beers
set
and
this
one
does
cant
wait
to
have
more
this
isnt
necessarily
the
most
flavorful
beer
ive
had
recently
but
i
found
this
extremely
thirstquenching
very
nicely
balanced
and
very
drinkable
seems
like
a
solid
summer
seasonal
to
me
can
i
have
another
overall
this
is
a
really
nice
summer
beer
i
have
enjoyed
many
beers
by
new
belgium
in
the
past
but
i
havent
drank
too
many
of
their
seasonals
this
is
a
summer
beer
that
i
will
look
forward
to
drinking
again
o
a
great
summer
beer
from
new
belgium
the
playful
fruit
and
spice
complexities
of
somersault
give
it
distinctive
flavor
with
a
clean
soft
finish
for
an
allaround
refreshing
and
enjoyable
treat
overall
liked
it
for
the
first
6
ounces
then
the
more
i
drank
of
the
six
pack
the
worse
it
became
another
average
new
belgium
beer
good
enough
to
drink
the
entire
sixe
but
not
good
enough
to
buy
again
overall
i
like
it
and
would
consider
it
a
good
choice
for
a
beer
to
bring
to
a
bbq
or
other
outside
hot
event
where
you
want
something
thirstquenching
but
also
flavorful
however
it
doesnt
blow
me
away
to
the
point
of
wanting
to
buy
a
second
sixpack
but
id
certainly
be
tempted
to
pick
on
up
again
next
year
overall
this
brew
is
great
for
hanging
out
on
the
patio
during
the
summer
very
drinkable
and
full
of
flavor
drink
it
and
enjoy
drinkability
is
awesome
on
this
beer
a
great
balance
of
all
things
needed
the
perfect
summer
seasonal
beer
a
beer
could
not
be
matched
any
better
to
a
season
overall
impressive
summer
seasonal
from
new
belgium
complex
clean
and
crisp
entirely
drinkable
and
session
friendly
one
of
the
better
summer
releases
out
there
bud
light
lime
eat
your
heart
out
thanks
bry
yummy
o
a
more
grownup
shandy
though
thats
not
what
the
style
classification
designates
a
lawnmower
beer
for
sure
and
a
good
one
at
that
o
good
mellow
beervery
refreshing
chasin
cheers
very
interesting
beer
ive
had
it
from
the
bottle
and
on
tap
pours
a
golden
color
edging
towards
amber
with
1
finger
of
pearly
head
with
abundant
lacing
the
smell
is
distinctly
hemp
to
me
very
grassy
and
resiny
the
flavor
is
full
of
grassy
and
flowery
hops
with
an
almost
honey
flavor
very
complex
and
almost
seems
to
change
from
sip
to
sip
palate
is
almost
syrupy
from
the
flavors
but
not
in
a
bad
way
overall
a
tasty
little
beer
with
lots
of
complexity
o
almost
perfection
i
think
a
bit
thick
on
the
oats
would
like
a
bit
better
hop
presence
but
close
oh
so
close
definitely
a
good
warm
weather
beer
easy
drinking
with
subtle
pleasant
flavors
overall
this
was
very
good
with
a
memorable
fruity
profile
well
worth
seeking
out
during
the
hot
months
of
summer
overall
an
outstanding
summer
brew
i
would
highly
recommend
this
to
anyone
this
could
be
a
good
brew
to
convert
some
of
your
aal
friends
with
at
least
introduce
them
to
some
new
styles
i
will
absolutely
buy
and
drink
this
again
everything
about
this
brew
says
summertime
and
i
love
summertime
personally
i
cant
quite
see
how
ba
jason
scored
this
at
100
granted
the
clarity
and
palate
definition
is
impressive
but
i
would
consider
this
another
summertype
ale
high
drinkability
with
the
usual
lemon
component
and
a
watery
finish
nothing
special
here
overall
impression
loved
it
really
enjoyed
that
this
wasnt
just
a
boring
crackery
typical
american
blonde
ale
i
loved
the
light
hop
character
in
the
aroma
flavor
and
bitterness
it
provided
a
nice
counterpoint
without
killing
the
palate
well
done
and
great
for
the
summer
would
be
wonderful
with
a
mild
cheese
plate
think
brie
and
a
crisp
dinner
salad
with
chilled
shrimp
beer
is
light
in
body
a
little
bitter
on
the
end
an
interesting
yeastiness
to
the
beer
easy
drinking
light
wet
not
dry
very
nice
i
may
have
it
again
o
first
off
i
suppose
its
better
than
alot
of
the
mostly
crap
summer
offerings
but
this
nb
is
just
not
for
me
i
have
been
enjoying
some
high
quality
stouts
and
ipaiipa
lately
so
maybe
i
am
spoiled
this
beer
just
furthers
my
belief
that
this
time
of
year
is
the
doldrums
for
beer
the
search
continues
picked
up
a
sixpack
while
in
obx
seemed
like
a
good
beach
beer
it
was
instead
of
the
clean
bland
blond
ales
you
usually
meet
in
the
summer
this
had
a
lovely
mix
of
mild
citrus
hops
and
grapefruit
sourness
not
bitterness
that
adds
an
extrarefreshing
edge
the
aroma
has
a
mix
of
freshly
toasted
breadmalt
and
light
apricot
fruit
overall
a
great
take
on
the
style
im
glad
to
see
brewers
finally
figuring
out
how
to
make
a
fun
and
satisfying
blond
ale
mouthfeel
medium
bodied
average
carbonation
somewhat
grainy
but
retains
drinkability
flavors
are
well
balanced
dry
finish
quite
a
flavorful
beer
for
the
style
and
a
pretty
damn
good
summer
beer
overall
this
is
an
exceptional
summer
ale
you
can
tell
the
main
focus
here
is
drinkability
while
still
maintaining
a
layered
and
flavorful
brew
they
succeeded
but
fell
short
in
a
couple
areas
the
nose
is
a
bit
weak
and
i
think
they
could
have
brought
the
overall
flavor
up
a
notch
and
still
maintained
the
level
of
drinkability
recommended
to
anyone
looking
for
a
really
good
summer
ale
cheers
c
o
great
summer
beer
would
purchase
a
12
pack
of
this
easily
o
great
summer
brew
will
definitely
enjoy
again
this
summer
excellent
beer
surprised
it
took
me
so
long
to
try
this
one
its
interesting
because
its
different
but
its
almost
too
much
like
cider
and
not
so
much
like
beer
i
wouldnt
buy
another
one
because
its
too
sweet
and
weird
o
not
bad
for
a
summer
ale
light
but
fairly
complex
very
refreshing
and
drinkable
nice
dry
finish
perfect
summer
beer
nice
lingering
sweet
citrus
flavors
would
get
again
for
sure
pours
out
to
a
frothy
white
head
excellent
lacing
golden
color
clear
aroma
is
a
nice
blend
of
fruitiness
spicy
hops
and
soft
grain
flavors
are
light
but
interesting
and
complex
with
apricot
and
a
hint
of
fat
tire
biscuityness
mouthfeel
is
light
and
the
co2
is
generous
overall
this
beer
takes
the
concept
of
a
blonde
ale
in
some
interesting
directions
i
dont
know
if
they
actually
put
apricots
in
it
or
what
the
purpose
of
the
oats
were
but
it
works
t
lots
of
citrus
upfront
mainly
lemon
with
some
crackery
malt
peppery
hops
and
a
touch
of
tropical
fruit
apricot
very
present
as
well
super
easy
to
drink
without
sacrificing
depth
of
flavor
really
impressed
maybe
the
best
summer
beer
ive
come
across
oveall
there
is
a
new
summer
beer
champion
and
its
name
is
new
belguim
somersault
medium
bodied
displaying
a
nice
range
of
flavors
from
malts
fruits
and
a
light
touch
of
hops
the
malt
is
very
lightly
toasted
not
getting
in
the
way
of
the
apricot
and
lemon
freshness
theres
a
slight
tartness
from
these
fruits
just
enough
to
be
pleasantly
summery
without
making
you
pucker
the
hops
in
the
back
are
citrusy
and
a
touch
floral
giving
a
quick
bitterness
that
is
packed
full
of
citrusy
flavor
and
adding
to
a
dryness
to
a
juicy
finish
the
mouthfeel
is
smooth
almost
slick
and
goes
down
incredibly
easily
this
would
be
a
fantastic
beer
to
sit
down
and
enjoy
a
few
of
on
a
hot
summer
afternoon
chock
full
of
more
flavor
than
your
average
summer
beer
this
one
is
definitely
worth
a
buy
t
sweet
almost
a
fruit
beer
it
has
so
much
berry
and
lemon
in
it
the
aftertaste
drops
into
seltzerwater
territory
which
isnt
my
palates
preferred
destination
so
i
dock
points
for
that
otherwise
a
good
choice
for
a
hotweather
beer
o
i
look
forward
to
summer
seasonals
this
one
is
an
easy
drinker
after
mowing
the
yard
on
those
hot
summer
days
oi
am
not
overly
familiar
with
the
style
but
felt
that
this
was
worth
trying
will
only
try
again
if
nothing
else
intriguing
on
the
menu
overall
impression
this
beer
doesnt
fit
into
my
normal
scheme
of
brews
the
sweet
and
sour
nature
is
like
yen
and
yang
going
at
it
i
like
sweet
beers
and
i
like
sour
ipas
but
the
contrast
is
balanced
and
is
interesting
i
think
this
beer
would
be
nice
in
a
breakfast
situation
or
with
grilled
fish
palate
is
a
litle
oily
but
refreshing
and
vibrant
has
the
same
high
brownishdark
yellow
hue
of
many
ipas
when
poured
from
a
12oz
bottle
had
the
same
distinctive
fruit
and
hop
smells
of
a
classic
ipa
even
tasted
something
like
a
mild
ipa
upon
first
taste
however
finished
with
the
sweet
malt
notes
of
a
lager
imagine
if
sam
adams
boston
lager
had
slightly
more
pronounced
hop
notes
and
toned
down
its
big
malt
finish
a
bit
very
interesting
and
very
good
beer
overall
not
a
bad
brew
it
definately
fits
perfectly
with
the
seasonal
category
as
its
offered
ill
probably
drink
this
again
with
some
grilled
chicken
at
the
lake
overall
sigh
not
doing
it
for
me
not
having
another
one
of
these
thats
for
sure
but
it
could
be
worse
overall
another
great
brew
from
new
belgium
thats
worth
your
time
i
certainly
wont
fault
the
high
rating
the
bros
gave
to
this
one
i
suppose
this
is
a
matter
of
preference
whether
you
like
the
sharp
and
tart
flavor
it
doesnt
relate
very
well
to
the
blonde
category
more
like
a
maltfree
wit
with
an
overdose
of
citrus

the
12

o
this
a
great
blond
from
nb
its
a
great
summer
beer
and
i
look
forward
to
drinking
this
on
a
nice
hot
summer
day
im
not
a
big
blonde
ale
fan
this
has
more
flavor
than
many
but
that
flavor
is
an
artificialtasting
lemon
not
offensive
but
not
really
what
i
am
looking
for
in
a
beer
overall
a
great
sipping
beer
for
a
warm
summer
day
absolutely
love
somersault
from
new
belgium
one
of
my
favorite
blonde
ales
and
summer
seasonal
the
taste
is
fantastic
a
nice
blend
of
citrus
and
smooth
finish
i
highly
recommend
this
beer
to
anyone
for
a
summer
beer
very
easy
to
relax
and
enjoy
a
nice
summers
day
with
not
the
worst
beer
of
its
kind
but
horribly
unbalanced
why
cant
they
make
more
beers
like
dig
which
are
thick
juicy
and
with
a
moderate
hop
explosion
this
works
aromawise
but
the
drinking
experience
on
its
own
is
not
my
favorite
works
well
with
a
meal
due
to
its
lightness
but
its
definitely
a
blonde
ale
that
was
trying
to
be
something
else
whatever
it
was
ive
no
clue
pale
yellow
with
a
fluffy
threefinger
head
and
lots
of
lacing
smell
is
grainy
and
not
great
but
the
taste
is
nicetoasted
grain
tart
citrus
hop
a
little
bit
of
apricot
faint
sourness
in
the
aftertaste
which
makes
it
not
as
easy
of
a
drinker
as
i
would
like
would
probably
drink
again
in
the
summer
if
i
was
to
rank

small

like
czech

is
very
lemony
but
not
in
a
fresh
lemons
way
at
all
a
light
biscuity

flavor
comes
in
there
too
right
before
the
metallic
brassy
tart
aftertaste
comes
in
pretty
gross
at
the
end
actually
feel
is
too
light
even
for
a
summer
beer
there
is
just
no

here
at
all
medium
carbonation
is
fine
but
this

isnt
happening

the

by
some

the
beer
pours
light
copper

mostly
transparent
the
fairly
thin
white
head
that
recedes
pretty
quickly
but
leaves
some
nice
strings

path
the

includes
spicy
and

a

the

this
would
be
an
excellent

and
very
drinkable
o
this
is
quite
good
though
im
disappointed
im
drinking
my
first
at
the
end
of
october
rather
than
the
end
of
summer
as
it
would
make
a
great
summer
drink
perhaps
a
bit
more
acidity
than
i
prefer
on
its
own
but
i
will
try
pairing
the
next

i
have
to
say
i
am
very
impressive
with
this
beer
i
have
to
say
this
is
the
first
beer
from
this
brewery
i
would
drink
on
a
day
to
day
bases
a
nice
finish
to
this
beer
i
really
love
the
after
taste
of
this
beer
find
it
before
the
summer
ends
cheers
overall
i
wanted
to
like
this
i
like
blondes
it
looked
good
and
while
i
went
into
it
thinking
that
i
should
be
comparing
to
session
beers
not
actual
blondes
i
still
found
myself
bored
and
uninterested
d
very
refreshing
summer
beer
id
recommend
picking
up
a
few
of
these
typical
sweetness
to
new
belgium
beer
o
not
what
i
expected
but
still
an
average
brew
overall
not
my
favorite
style
but
this
is
an
excellent
representative
of
this
style
really
nice
balance
and
combination
of
flavors
and
lite
enough
to
be
very
refreshing
and
lower
abv
makes
this
a
great
session
beer
and
a
great
thirst
quencher
for
the
warmer
months
overall
drinkability
the
mouthfeel
really
puts
a
damper
on
this
beer
makes
it
feel
lifeless
might
make
a
decent
session
beer
for
newbies
or
as
a
gateway
ipaesb
meh
nose
is
grassy
and
grainy
with
a
slight
mustiness
and
a
gentle
fruit
presence
a
wave
of
juicy
sweet
apricot
and
apple
flavors
up
front
but
a
touch
of
tangy
lemon
keeps
the
sweetness
in
check
theres
a
light
earthy
hop
presence
that
lends
a
nice
depth
very
lively
feel
to
this
stuff
tingly
carbonation
with
a
light
toasty
malt
profile
and
a
very
clean
crisp
finish
regardless
of
style
this
is
a
pretty
damned
refreshing
brew
it
was
the
perfect
lawnmower
beer
on
this
day
as
a
blonde
ale
top
notch
o
fantastic
ale
great
for
if
you
want
substantive
flavor
without
the
high
abv
of
an
ipa
hard
to
categorize
andor
compare
head
to
head
with
other
beers
ive
tasted
and
i
like
that
about
it
o
a
very
refreshing
and
satisfying
beer
on
the
lighter
side
of
the
spectrum
clean
clean
and
direct
in
its
intentions
to
enliven
your
summer
days
i
enjoyed
this
one
more
and
more
with
continued
sips
overall
a
strong
beer
its
probably
one
of
my
favorites
from
new
belgium
it
amazes
me
how
consistent
this
brewery
is
i
drank
this
beer
whenever
it
was
overwhelmingly
hot
outside
i
have
got
to
say
that
it
filled
the
void
well
while
all
of
my
lame
friends
were
sitting
around
wasting
their
lives
on
lesser
beer
this
definitely
gave
me
drinkable
refreshment
without
compromising
a
complex
flavor
one
of
the
better
aba
ive
had
wouldnt
expect
anything
less
from
new
belgium
a
very
well
crafted
blonde
ale
fantastic
summer
beer
for
when
the
heat
index
is
106
like
it
is
here
today
this
is
an
excellent
summer
seasonal
highly
refreshing
bright
fresh
flavors
and
very
drinkable
o
a
nice
summer
beer
that
has
a
bit
of
complexity
said
it
before
ill
say
it
again
blonde
ales
just
dont
do
it
for
me
that
mes
amis
is
why
this
one
is
special
west
coast
allusions
in
the
hop
register
to
go
with
a
solid
if
stoic
malt
base
while
not
exactly
encouraging
me
to
act
out
assoverteakettle
notions
its
still
a
decent
summer
quaff
o
a
pleasant
surprise
although
somersault
has
a
different
flavor
profile
theres
enough
similarity
for
me
to
highly
recommend
this
to
fans
of
magic
hat
9
this
one
is
probably
bestofstyle
for
me
so
far
and
one
i
anticipate
seeking
out
in
the
future
drink
as
i
mentioned
this
was
much
better
cold
but
still
a
tasty
little
beer
unique
on
the
balance
between
blonde
and
ipa
or
apa
probably
wont
have
this
one
again
im
not
normally
real
big
on
blonde
ales
nor
lighter
afternoon
beers
in
general
but
nb
really
did
themselves
proud
on
this
one
absolutely
pick
up
some
somersault
if
you
get
the
opportunity
its
great
on
a
sunny
afternoon
but
would
be
good
otherwise
as
well
even
if
you
tend
to
prefer
darker
fuller
brews
as
i
do
this
is
a
well
crafted
and
refreshing
dalliance
well
worth
your
time
and
money
well
played
new
belgium
well
played
i
really
like
that
not
one
component
of
this
beer
plays
the
dominant
role
here
the
fruit
spice
add
subtlely
to
the
complexity
and
flavor
of
this
beer
without
overwhelming
it
i
wouldnt
guess
there
were
any
additions
to
this
beer
necessarily
and
that
is
a
good
sign
when
adding
extra
ingredients
in
a
light
summer
quaffer
i
am
definitely
enjoying
this
beer
light
refreshing
malty
fruity
spicy
and
even
a
touch
hoppy
this
beer
is
quite
complex
and
i
am
quite
happy
to
be
having
a
sixer
of
this
i
have
a
feeling
this
beer
is
going
to
be
completely
overlooked
by
the
beergeek
set
but
i
am
quite
pleased
with
it
overall
easy
to
drink
beer
and
easy
to
dismiss
as
nothing
special
admit
tingly
i
did
the
first
time
i
tried
it
but
as
a
light
summer
beer
its
got
a
really
beauty
to
it
im
glad
i
gave
this
one
a
second
chance
dvery
drinkable
it
is
on
par
with
other
summer
brews
somersault
pours
a
little
bit
darker
than
blonde
its
a
step
or
two
towards
tangerine
and
crystal
clear
the
white
foam
that
crowns
the
beer
hits
three
fingers
in
height
and
displays
above
average
head
retention
the
sides
of
the
glass
are
left
heavily
coated
in
lacing
the
nose
has
a
light
grainy
sweetness
with
a
definite
touch
of
apricot
the
combination
of
grapefruit
from
the
centennial
hops
and
a
little
bit
of
ginger
forms
an
interesting
counterpoint
in
the
aroma
the
flavor
is
more
of
the
same
with
a
gentle
rolling
bitterness
serving
as
a
transition
between
the
sweet
flavors
and
the
hops
and
ginger
mid
palate
im
pleasantly
surprised
at
how
nice
and
mild
the
grapefruit
presence
is
i
havent
been
a
huge
fan
of
beers
that
use
predominantly
centennial
in
the
past
the
mouthfeel
is
nice
relatively
light
bodied
for
a
summer
ale
and
paired
with
a
carbonation
that
does
more
than
just
cut
through
the
beer
but
stops
short
of
the
bubbly
activity
of
say
a
well
brewed
belgian
somersault
is
a
solidly
put
together
beer
and
one
i
could
drink
a
lot
of
while
hanging
out
with
friends
on
a
hot
summer
day
overall
this
is
a
solid
beer
very
refreshing
and
smooth
could
enjoy
this
all
night
long
on
a
summer
night
this
is
one
of
the
best
beers
to
drink
on
a
hot
day
when
your
mouth
is
dry
once
you
pop
it
open
you
just
cant
stop
drinking
it
easily
sessionable
especially
at
5
2
perfect
summer
brew
gets
high
marks
for
a
great
tasting
and
supremely
balanced
beer
o
a
good
refreshing
summer
beer
this
beer
goes
down
very
easy
and
is
a
perfect
choice
for
a
sunny
day
outside
whether
you
are
on
the
back
deck
mowing
the
yard
or
off
to
the
beach
this
beer
is
sure
to
satisfy
somersault
is
no
hoptoberfest
but
it
has
a
lot
to
recommend
it
over
summer
beers
of
the
same
price
point
give
it
a
whirl
and
see
what
it
does
for
you
overall
this
is
a
great
summer
blonde
that
will
make
most
anyone
happy
they
didnt
pass
it
up
additionally
its
a
fairly
low
calorie
beer
which
is
an
added
bonus
i
wish
i
had
bought
more
of
it
d
good
session
beer
great
thick
head
that
lasts
a
good
long
time
the
color
was
a
deep
amber
so
far
so
good
not
much
in
the
aroma
department
the
flavor
comes
on
with
a
bit
of
bitter
then
fades
through
some
subtle
fruit
hints
i
am
a
big
new
belgium
fan
but
the
somersault
did
not
have
me
doing
somersaults
im
reviewing
this
to
style
as
a
blonde
i
think
its
very
good
its
not
my
favorite
style
but
this
is
great
summer
drinking
refreshing
without
being
too
filling
overall
while
not
bad
i
just
couldnt
get
into
this
one
not
much
aroma
or
flavor
so
it
doesnt
stand
out
at
all
if
i
want
an
easy
drinking
nbb
id
rather
grab
a
mothership
wit
avail
here
in
tx
one
is
enough
for
me
nn
first
time
ive
had
this
beer
it
reminds
me
of
sunshine
wheat
in
that
it
was
missing
something
a
orange
or
lemon
slice
and
sad
to
say
i
didnt
have
either
but
i
am
happy
to
say
a
slice
of
grape
fruit
made
this
beer
just
right
if
you
get
this
beer
i
think
a
lemon
slice
would
make
it
much
better
overall
a
great
summer
beer
pours
a
golden
yellow
with
carbonation
floating
to
meet
the
soft
head
the
nose
offers
up
grains
and
fruit
taste
is
sweet
fruit
and
a
hint
of
citrus
overall
very
good
mouthfeel
is
medium
bodied
and
heavily
carbonated
another
solid
beer
from
nb
i
generally
dont
have
much
love
for
new
belgium
and
wouldnt
have
even
tried
somersault
if
it
werent
for
a
mom
that
is
learning
to
embrace
craft
beer
im
not
blown
out
of
the
water
but
this
light
pale
ale
was
kept
tasteful
while
including
some
fruit
and
spices
this
beer
pours
a
clear
golden
color
with
a
finger
of
white
head
that
dissipates
rapidly
but
does
leave
some
lacing
the
aroma
is
weak
but
has
some
fruity
hop
notes
as
well
as
some
maltiness
the
flavor
starts
with
sweet
malt
and
then
becomes
floral
and
finishes
with
a
slighty
spiciness
the
mouthfeel
is
nice
and
balanced
and
finishes
clean
overall
a
decent
summer
ale
works
well
as
a
thrist
quencher
as
a
sipper
like
at
a
bbq
i
think
it
wont
work
on
tap
at
the
clips
of
faith
event
in
santa
cruz
3
ounce
sample
pours
clear
gold
with
a
small
white
froth
aroma
is
unripe
apricots
and
honey
malts
with
a
floral
tinge
flavor
is
wheaty
banana
tart
apricots
floral
hops
with
a
watery
finish
flavorful
but
the
apricot
thing
gets
old
and
the
finish
is
too
short
edit
had
another
couple
bottles
a
few
days
later
got
a
bit
of
a
tartsourness
in
the
flavor
its
just
slight
though
added
a
nice
touch
overall
i
found
this
to
be
ok
new
belgium
has
done
better
work
but
this
beer
is
good
at
being
a
summer
quencher
o
a
decent
enough
light
summer
beer
however
not
really
that
great
of
a
beer
a
pleasant
summer
ale
at
a
moderate
abv
i
wish
that
the
yeast
flavor
werent
so
present
in
the
finish
and
aftertaste
however
as
it
seems
to
take
out
some
of
the
refreshing
aspect
overall
a
very
good
summer
brew
one
of
the
more
complex
ones
ive
had
overall
this
is
a
wellrounded
highly
sessionable
summer
beer
tried
the
somersault
after
having
a
mothership
wit
although
it
was
completely
different
from
the
mw
it
was
a
very
nice
improvement
the
first
sip
had
a
nickel
taste
but
got
batter
after
awhile
as
i
was
finishing
the
beer
however
it
became
more
of
a
blah
taste
that
could
be
it
getting
a
bit
warm
but
it
felt
like
it
faded
out
flavor
relies
on
being
smooth
and
light
but
theres
actually
a
decent
hop
kick
here
fruit
component
is
mellower
than
the
nose
which
is
welcome
body
is
light
clean
and
very
drinkable
interesting
slightly
outside
the
box
but
pleasant
i
had
this
one
on
tap
this
afternoon
up
at
the
brewery
poured
a
clear
golden
color
with
a
small
lingering
white
head
aromas
of
lime
zest
wheat
and
yeast
on
the
palate
this
one
was
fairly
light
bodied
and
very
refreshing
with
a
flavors
of
wheat
and
light
citrus
mouthfeel
is
light
a
little
slick
and
sticky
overall
pretty
good
for
the
style
i
really
liked
it
i
found
it
refreshing
and
very
tasty
i
was
apprehensive
about
trying
it
because
i
didnt
like
some
of
the
other
beers
from
new
belgium
but
i
really
enjoyed
this
perfect
for
a
hot
summer
night
good
fruity
taste
that
is
very
smooth
o
i
have
had
almost
a
case
of
this
beer
now
i
was
really
impressed
with
the
beer
when
i
first
had
it
i
was
staying
in
the
desert
and
working
outside
all
day
it
was
fantastically
refreshing
and
flavorful
in
the
heat
now
that
i
am
in
cooler
weather
in
san
diego
i
do
not
enjoy
the
beer
as
much
still
it
is
very
well
done
and
is
a
good
beer
for
initiating
those
who
think
they
dont
like
craft
beer
this
was
a
great
hot
weather
beer
sweet
enough
to
give
it
flavor
but
dry
and
crisp
to
make
it
refreshing
goes
down
real
easy
its
hard
not
to
want
to
gulp
this
a
real
thirst
quencher
tastes
more
like
a
lager
than
an
ale
except
for
the
wheat
and
citrus
notes
sessionable
without
a
doubt
could
drain
a
case
of
this
on
a
hot
summer
day
all
praise
aside
its
not
groundbreaking
but
certainly
worth
trying
the
beer
pours
a
yellow
color
with
a
white
head
the
aroma
is
full
of
wheat
with
some
grass
from
the
hops
the
flavor
is
more
of
the
same
with
a
little
bit
of
citrus
notes
mixed
in
still
the
dominant
flavor
is
wheat
with
not
too
much
else
exciting
going
on
easy
to
drink
and
i
think
this
would
go
nicely
on
a
hop
summer
day
medium
mouthfeel
and
medium
carbonation
overall
id
pass
on
this
one
again
not
a
drainpour
but
not
sometime
id
actively
seek
out
overall
a
good
refreshing
summertime
option
and
more
enjoyable
than
the
oh
what
was
it
skinny
dip
thats
it
better
than
that
one
the
apricot
is
very
light
not
nearly
as
distinct
as
in
magic
hats
9
overall
a
crisp
refreshing
fairly
flavorful
blonde
ale
and
as
a
summer
seasonal
it
is
light
years
better
than
the
old
skinny
dip
while
the
apricot
and
ginger
additions
are
minimal
that
may
be
a
good
thing
as
it
just
provides
balance
and
subtle
complexity
love
the
exclusive
use
of
centennial
hops
since
i
am
not
a
hophead
i
cant
put
this
in
my
top
ten
but
i
certainly
can
appreciate
it
overall
a
very
good
blonde
and
i
can
easily
say
it
is
one
of
the
best
for
the
style
appearance
is
a
golden
yellow
with
a
thin
but
steady
head
and
spotty
lace
smell
of
the
light
apricot
blending
with
the
malt
and
hops
taste
has
that
light
sweet
apricot
note
with
a
light
blend
of
hops
that
make
it
go
down
easy
but
leaves
a
twang
in
the
end
mouthfeel
is
light
with
good
body
and
carbonation
not
bad
i
like
the
initial
flavor
but
not
the
cloying
twang
in
the
end
o
i
prefer
citrus
to
stonefruit
flavors
so
id
rather
drink
the
skinny
dip
but
since
new
belgium
is
rotating
their
seasonals
now
this
is
the
current
option
not
sure
ill
be
buying
more
of
this
or
not
this
summer
and
will
likely
try
other
seasonals
before
returning
to
this
one
poured
a
light
yellow
with
an
average
sized
frothy
white
head
that
was
mostly
lasting
and
had
excellent
lacing
the
aroma
was
very
mild
of
a
grain
malt
and
a
moderate
dose
of
floral
hops
with
a
hint
of
citrus
lemon
apricot
and
spices
it
tasted
very
lightly
sweet
with
notes
of
citrus
and
fruit
at
first
then
became
a
tad
sour
with
a
mild
hoppy
finish
mouthfeel
was
light
in
body
and
watery
yet
a
little
dry
in
texture
with
a
very
soft
carbonation
overall
basically
a
lager
with
a
little
more
of
a
hoppy
flavor
very
little
really
nice
and
very
drinkable
the
body
is
light
but
not
watery
the
carbonation
is
ample
and
adds
a
little
bit
of
fizz
before
a
slightly
dry
finish
this
one
is
neither
here
nor
there
which
i
think
was
the
plan
easy
to
drink
no
problems
no
frills
the
color
when
poured
was
a
golden
yellow
with
medium
foam
and
medium
amount
of
lace
the
smell
of
hops
citrus
and
a
hint
of
apricot
was
evident
and
had
a
pleasant
aroma
the
taste
had
a
fair
amount
of
citrus
flavor
with
hops
peach
and
apricot
also
a
fair
amount
of
acidic
citrus
feel
on
the
palate
all
in
all
a
nice
pleasant
flavor
and
nicely
balance
of
sweetacidicfruity
flavor
o
it
took
me
a
couple
of
sips
to
like
it
but
now
i
cant
stop
drinking
it
this
beer
can
be
quite
assertive
when
you
first
try
it
but
believe
me
it
only
gets
better
great
summer
beer
it
could
make
a
great
pairing
for
an
asian
salad
or
a
rosemary
lemon
chicken
probably
very
good
with
thai
food
as
well
pours
a
clear
golden
yellow
with
a
decent
fluffy
head
and
a
bit
of
lacing
citrusy
hops
on
the
nose
cereal
and
a
touch
of
apricot
biscuity
grain
on
the
palate
with
a
decent
hop
background
and
a
bit
of
apricot
though
not
sweet
also
it
has
that
dry
biscuit
finish
that
i
associate
with
a
lot
of
new
belgium
beers
and
i
assume
might
be
from
the
particular
strain
of
yeast
that
they
use
decent
summer
beer
and
one
i
like
more
than
some
of
their
other
offerings
o
overall
a
well
balanced
tasty
and
even
a
bit
unique
beer
a
really
good
outdoor
summer
type
beer
which
is
exactly
what
theyre
going
for
here
i
suppose
aroma
was
a
little
wanting
bright
yellowgold
with
a
big
creamy
white
head
that
sticks
around
as
a
milky
covering
until
the
bottom
of
the
glass
leafy
centennial
aromatics
peppery
citrus
light
fruit
and
flowery
hops
over
some
pale
malt
juicy
citrus
and
apricot
flavor
very
refreshing
floral
slightly
oily
green
hops
and
lemon
zest
light
bodied
and
easily
drinkable
the
fruitiness
can
wear
on
the
palate
after
a
couple
but
not
a
bad
summer
seasonal
pours
from
bottle
into
cold
chilled
glass
golden
colored
clear
no
haze
moderate
head
that
dissipates
quickly
light
citrus
flavor
with
light
hoppy
notes
smell
is
quite
floral
but
not
overwhelming
a
very
solid
summertime
beer
and
a
very
good
seasonal
for
hot
summer
days
very
nice
notes
of
citrus
and
grains
i
had
a
bit
of
an
issue
with
getting
choked
on
it
probably
my
lazy
sipping
mechanism
so
i
wont
blame
the
beer
but
overall
very
nice
and
very
drinkable
a
very
nice
choice
from
nbb
not
too
overrated
like
some
of
their
other
offerings
order
it
and
give
it
a
try
d
i
found
this
beer
to
be
very
drinkable
and
i
took
care
of
my
33
9
oz
surprisingly
quickly
if
the
weather
had
been
warmer
and
i
had
no
obligations
that
evening
i
wouldnt
have
hesitated
to
order
another
very
a
pretty
good
beer
with
a
nice
variety
of
fruity
hops
but
i
find
the
flavors
unbalanced
and
rather
disjointed
needs
a
stronger
malt
base
more
carbonation
i
could
enjoy
several
of
these
on
a
hot
summer
day
super
refreshing
and
delicious
pours
a
nice
golden
orange
smell
is
grainy
dry
and
some
citrus
taste
is
not
that
complex
to
me
it
is
very
dry
and
grainy
not
very
balanced
and
the
abv
seems
higher
than
it
is
this
one
goes
straight
to
my
head
without
any
nuanced
enjoyment
it
feels
light
but
the
finish
is
so
dry
that
it
hurts
drinkability
it
has
more
of
a
liquor
feel
to
it
than
a
beer
feel
maybe
thats
just
the
style
but
i
dont
particularly
care
for
it
i
dont
think
i
would
buy
this
one
again
it
just
seems
like
alcohol
for
the
sake
of
alcohol
nothing
special
to
give
it
taste
enjoyment
very
quaffable
beer
quite
appropriate
for
the
summer
but
i
still
love
skinny
dip
pours
a
clear
bright
golden
color
with
a
medium
white
head
that
diminishes
slowly
scent
is
very
grassy
with
hints
of
citrus
lemon
taste
is
initially
lemony
with
some
hoppy
notes
then
i
get
some
grassy
floral
notes
that
ate
quite
pleasant
finishes
with
more
lemon
and
hops
mouthfeel
is
nicely
carbonated
and
refreshing
drinkability
is
high
overall
this
is
not
even
close
to
being
my
favorite
style
in
beer
but
it
is
a
great
one
for
summertime
this
pours
dark
golden
and
has
very
active
bubbles
and
fluffy
head
this
beer
like
some
other
new
belgium
beers
seems
pretty
earthy
this
one
is
particularly
herbal
and
bitter
and
not
that
amazing
this
tastes
like
a
bad
salad
ok
ok
its
decent
i
dont
usually
prefer
summer
beers
for
these
weedlike
flavors
so
shoot
me
this
is
medium
bodied
and
drinkable
but
i
dont
want
another
gotta
love
the
play
on
words
o
something
i
would
reach
for
one
nice
warm
day
when
i
looking
to
have
a
few
beers
good
summer
style
jh
o
i
was
very
thirsty
when
i
was
choosing
what
to
review
and
out
of
all
the
beers
i
have
this
one
seemed
the
best
for
a
hot
day
when
your
real
thirsty
definitely
a
good
choice
for
that
decent
beer
nothing
to
seek
out
or
write
home
about
pours
a
crystal
clear
light
orange
color
with
a
12
inch
white
head
that
fades
to
a
thin
cap
fat
foamy
rings
of
lace
form
on
the
glass
on
the
drink
down
smell
is
of
sweet
malt
honey
citrus
and
slight
apricotpeach
notes
taste
is
of
sweet
malt
citrus
apricotpeach
and
unfortunately
a
cooked
veggie
flavor
which
really
detracts
from
the
taste
there
is
a
good
level
of
carbonation
with
a
bubbly
and
smooth
mouthfeel
overall
the
veggie
flavor
in
the
taste
kind
of
ruins
the
beer
i
would
be
willing
to
try
this
from
a
bottle
to
see
if
the
same
thing
happens
again
overall
i
got
a
few
of
these
in
the
summer
mix
twelver
from
nb
the
first
one
i
pretty
much
hated
and
im
reviewing
the
second
one
now
my
opinion
of
the
beer
has
definitely
improved
since
my
first
taste
of
it
but
it
is
not
a
beer
i
would
buy
on
its
own
in
single
bomber
or
sixpack
format
a

do
have
to
say
pretty
hoppy
for
a
blonde
ale
good
sitting
by
the
pool

overallanother
good
beer
from

nothing
to
fight
over
though
good
summer
session
beer
but
not
all
that
refreshing
6
pack

store
6
99
clear
deep
golden
beer
small
yet
persistent
pure
white
head
fruity
lemon
scents
and
nice
malty
hops
simple
yet
nice
smmoth
malty
flavour
with
noticable
apricot
the
oats
seem
to
help
keep
this
from
getting
too
sweet
and
thin
actually
a
nice
smooth
palate
probably
because
the
oats
overall
i
liked
this
yet
another
good
summer
quaffer
crystal
clear
straw
colored
body
with
a
lumpy
eggshell
cap
that
leaves
some
nice
lace
on
the
glass
untoasted
grain
citrus
zest
and
herbal
hops
in
the
aroma
mild
but
flavorful
with
a
nice
aggresive
chop
bite
over
a
lean
maltiness
that
falls
just
short
of
being
really
good
but
is
a
nice
refeshing
beer
anyway
soft
creamy
mouthfeel
no
doubt
from
the
addition
of
oats
a
nice
beer
overall
this
is
really
excellently
drinkable
stuff
i
will
definitely
get
this
again
some
other
time
o
overall
this
is
a
great
summer
session
beer
that
has
a
simple
but
strong
palate
its
tasty
enough
to
please
those
seeking
more
from
a
beer
than
the
buzz
but
subtle
enough
to
be
gentle
on
the
stomach
and
thirst
quenching
cheers
this
drinks
pretty
easily
the
style
is
the
craft
version
of
light
lager
just
more
flavor
this
beer
is
a
good
example
of
a
good
brewery
making
a
good
beer
that
has
mass
appeal
this
is
an
excellent
summertime
beer
that
would
be
enjoyed
by
pliny
and
bud
fans
overall
this
was
an
excellent
summer
beer
nothing
over
the
top
just
a
very
refreshing
brew
i
really
liked
the
subtle
apricot
and
how
easy
this
beer
went
down
definitely
worth
picking
up
a
sixer
now
i
just
need
new
belgium
to
can
this
beer
so
i
can
take
it
with
me
everywhere
i
go
this
summer
o
will
be
taking
the
rest
of
this
sixer
to
the
ballpark
tomorrow
i
enjoy
this
much
more
than
any
american
pale
wheat
ale
ive
tried
but
it
has
all
the
summertime
drinkability
and
lemon
presence
that
many
folks
flock
too
during
the
hot
months
this
could
be
a
summer
staple
for
me
somewhat
crisp
for
style
this
is
pretty
good
for
me
itd
have
to
be
a
blazing
hot
day
to
drink
it
just
for
the
lightness
of
taste
overall
a
very
interesting
beer
not
as
much
in
concept
but
more
in
its
actual
taste
o
this
is
a
decent
enough
session
beer
but
the
extreme
hop
flavor
and
yeast
profile
for
the
style
make
it
not
as
refreshing
as
other
versions
of
the
style
this
beer
is
a
bit
outofbalance
for
a
summer
thirstquencher
overall
i
have
to
say
my
expectations
are
far
exceeded
with
this
new
offering
from
new
belgium
i
think
i
may
have
found
my
summer
beer
i
love
how
drinkable
it
is
and
yet
the
flavor
profile
strays
just
far
enough
away
from
the
generic
light
and
sweet
pale
summer
beers
to
keep
things
interesting
overall
this
is
a
decent
summer
offering
that
is
drinkable
especially
on
a
hot
summer
day
however
it
is
lacking
in
taste
compared
to
other
summer
offerings
o
overall
tasty
this
would
be
a
nice
summer
brew
although
it
is
fairly
forgettable
it
matches
the
style
well
but
is
not
something
i
would
get
very
often
mouthfeel
very
clean
and
crisp
this
is
perfect
for
a
summer
beer
goes
down
very
easily
i
personally
dont
care
for
heavy
or
thick
beers
in
the
summer
which
is
contiguous
with
winter
stouts
and
ales
this
ale
has
honey
golden
color
with
a
head
that
clings
for
a
long
time
the
smell
is
bright
with
a
hint
of
complexity
the
flavor
has
a
medium
body
but
a
lot
of
balance
between
bitter
and
sweet
and
maltiness
the
flavor
stays
on
the
tongue
for
a
long
time
and
continues
to
get
better
sip
by
sip
this
is
a
fantastic
session
ale
overall
i
will
be
picking
this
up
again
a
great
summer
beer
and
one
packed
with
flavor
easy
to
quaff
and
quenches
the
thirst
good
job
new
belgium
comes
out
of
the
tap
a
clear
coppery
orange
amber
with
a
finebubbled
offwhite
head
aroma
is
malty
fruity
and
slightly
fruitsweet
crisp
mainly
fruity
is
almost
like
a
dry
cider
but
it
has
malty
and
wheaty
undertones
as
well
as
just
a
hint
of
lemon
texture
is
fizzy
and
lively
a
great
way
to
welcome
summer
i
will
definitely
be
enjoying
several
somersaults
this
summer
delicious
get
some
new
belgium
is
hit
and
miss
for
me
everyone
loves
fat
tire
but
not
me
i
enjoyed
their
ranger
ipa
not
enough
to
get
another
6
pack
of
it
but
i
wouldnt
turn
it
down
when
offered
so
when
i
had
a
chance
to
snag
brewjockeys
last
somersault
i
went
for
it
glad
i
did
this
is
good
stuff
and
a
total
departure
from
what
i
envisioned
new
belgium
to
be
ill
be
getting
more
of
this
beer
this
summer
beautiful
copper
with
clean
transparency
thin
white
foamy
head
that
retains
nicely
throughout
leaving
spotty
sea
foam
lace
the
smell
is
fruity
definite
touch
of
apricot
and
fruity
hops
on
a
clean
biscuit
bready
malt
backbone
touch
of
light
sweet
caramels
and
floral
tones
and
ginger
touches
nice
flowery
hops
kick
in
the
front
of
the
tounge
followed
by
light
fruits
of
apricot
lemon
and
pineaple
notes
citrusy
clean
bready
malts
with
a
touch
of
caramel
with
a
clean
finish
a
slight
creaminess
in
the
front
with
a
slightly
watery
finish
overall
watery
but
this
is
nice
for
a
summer
beer
nice
fruity
light
and
easy
to
drink
beer
nothing
cloying
in
the
fruit
great
well
rounded
hop
profile
with
a
light
bready
malt
great
easy
to
drink
summertime
beer
pouren
into
a
noic
a
dull
lighter
golder
with
athinner
but
well
defined
white
head
that
left
a
few
broken
rings
of
lace
as
it
settled
like
others
have
said
the
aromas
are
quite
yeasty
and
toastycaramelbiscuit
lends
a
little
sweetness
somewhat
dry
and
grainy
on
the
palatethe
big
yeastiness
again
is
a
big
component
of
the
beer
its
a
good
summer
brewa
little
bigger
than
many
with
its
full
on
yeast
attack
o
great
summertime
beer
and
that
is
what
it
was
brewed
for
i
love
new
belgium
beers
and
this
is
probably
second
to
fat
tire
i
would
recommend
this
for
a
hot
summer
afternoon
as
it
is
crip
and
refreshing
and
not
too
heavy
i
would
also
recommend
this
for
someone
who
regularly
drinks
commercial
beers
and
wants
to
explore
new
territory
pretty
good
whole
lot
better
than
skinny
dip
all
in
all
a
very
easy
drinking
summer
ale
if
this
one
is
going
to
be
on
store
shelves
this
summer
it
could
become
a
staple
at
my
house
especially
on
sale
the
overly
soapy
and
oily
hops
detract
for
me
i
love
new
belgium
but
there
are
many
other
beers
for
the
summer
that
i
will
pick
over
this
locally
made
at
that
nothing
i
would
recommend
a
well
constructed
and
sessionable
blonde
or
golden
ale
drinkability
can
be
described
as
meh
better
that
fat
tire
i
suppose
but
boring
no
resell
here
taste
is
smooth
and
rich
with
some
hint
of
spice
hops
and
a
soft
tint
of
fruit
underneath
it
all
quite
complex
especially
for
a
5
4
summer
ale
excellent
and
a
brew
i
always
stock
up
on
in
summer
this
beer
proves
that
fizzy
yellow
beer
doesnt
always
have
to
be
the
enemy
ya
hear
that
koch
it
so
often
is
of
course
but
this
beer
is
my
pick
for
summer
beer
2011
d
very
surprised
by
this
one
a
great
summer
beer
while
imho
not
a
stellar
overall
brew
overall
one
of
the
best
blonde
ales
i
might
have
ever
had
from
an
american
brewery
terrific
for
the
summer
and
much
better
than
last
summers
seasonal
by
new
belgium
skinny
dip
i
have
had
questions
at
the
pub
if
we
are
getting
their
skinny
dip
and
i
say
take
a
drink
of
this
one
fuckin
right
pours
a
clear
gold
color
34
inch
head
of
a
white
color
great
retention
and
great
lacing
smells
of
hops
slight
earthy
malt
slight
pine
and
slight
sweet
malt
fits
the
style
of
an
american
blonde
ale
mouth
feel
is
sharp
and
crisp
with
an
average
carbonation
level
tastes
of
citrus
hops
slight
pine
sweet
malt
slight
pale
malt
hint
of
earthy
malt
and
slight
spice
overall
good
appearance
blend
and
body
i
was
very
excited
to
try
new
belgiums
summer
ale
but
i
just
wasnt
that
impressed
ill
stick
to
fat
tire
wasnt
sure
quite
to
expect
but
enjoyed
this
perfect
for
drinking
on
the
patio
on
a
summer
evening
or
with
a
light
lunch
been
looking
for
a
good
summer
beer
since
the
demise
of
petes
rally
cap
this
has
hints
of
citrus
in
a
bright
light
beer
that
goes
down
all
too
easily
summer
doesnt
have
to
be
light
it
can
have
a
great
taste
while
retaining
its
easy
drinking
qualities
thats
what
new
belgium
has
done
with
somersault
it
was
very
difficult
to
put
down
my
glass
during
lunch
excellent
all
around
beer
a
refreshing
summer
brew
with
characteristic
nb
flavor
malts
are
grassy
and
smooth
clean
spicy
hops
in
the
finish
time
for
another
i
like
this
beer
for
several
reasons
well
first
off
i
do
not
find
bud
light
budweiser
miller
light
coors
light
etc
etc
etc
refreshing
i
know
many
bas
do
that
disgusting
husky
grain
smell
and
taste
are
just
brutal
i
get
that
smellflavor
in
so
many
american
blonde
ales
too
this
beer
skips
that
and
manages
to
become
incredibly
refreshing
and
tasty
its
a
great
hot
weather
beer
and
also
a
perfect
beer
to
pass
on
to
a
bmc
drinker
o
its
a
session
beer
and
i
can
see
where
they
were
going
with
it
its
actually
pretty
refreshing
i
certainly
could
see
drinking
a
couple
of
these
on
a
summer
day
nothing
though
stands
out
in
this
one
but
i
cant
say
its
not
a
decent
beer
either
o
overall
this
is
a
nice
and
drinkable
brew
but
the
flavors
are
a
bit
low
and
overall
very
standard
overall
pretty
good
a
good
summer
thirst
quencher
somersault
starts
with
the
aroma
which
has
a
certain
level
of
lemony
graininess
it
also
has
a
light
sourdough
bread
characteristic
that
i
usually
get
out
of
lagers
its
a
pretty
beer
blonde
in
color
with
a
nice
foamy
head
im
eating
this
with
goat
cheese
and
it
actually
goes
really
well
together
the
high
carbonation
of
the
beer
helps
to
scrub
the
palate
of
the
creamy
goat
cheese
and
the
citrusy
taste
plays
well
with
the
smooth
cheese
i
had
this
on
tap
earlier
this
week
and
didnt
really
care
for
it
but
for
whatever
reason
tonight
its
kind
of
hitting
the
spot
does
a
neat
trick
of
being
very
light
and
easy
to
drink
while
remaining
full
flavored
not
bad
at
all
i
know
this
is
an
american
blonde
but
i
swear
i
got
a
feeling
of
a
belgian
pale
from
it
light
yelloworange
in
color
decent
head
smells
like
orange
a
little
the
flavor
had
a
bit
of
citrus
and
peach
but
just
a
tiny
bit
and
then
i
tasted
spice
i
swear
this
wasnt
bad
but
i
did
not
find
it
as
refreshing
as
some
of
the
other
reviewers
here
and
i
most
likely
wont
revisit
this
the
body
was
on
the
thin
side
of
average
for
the
style
drinkability
was
ok
but
why
bother
when
there
are
better
examples
out
there
pours
a
brilliant
golden
hue
with
white
head
thick
at
first
then
retains
a
thin
rim
layer
nice
nose
is
on
the
light
side
with
some
herbal
notes
gentle
funk
in
the
background
palate
offers
a
pleasant
spicy
to
herbal
character
a
little
earthydirty
medium
bodied
not
too
light
and
finishes
herbalspicy
too
enjoyable
notes
this
is
perhaps
the
cleanest
brew
i
have
tasted
from
new
belgium
light
in
body
yet
very
fullflavored
this
is
an
ideal
summer
brew
very
wellbalanced
and
very
drinkable
this
is
one
of
the
better
summer
seasonal
ales
ive
had
in
a
long
time
a
very
nice
american
blonde
ale
i
will
happily
return
to
this
a
few
times
this
year
without
hesitation
o
easily
drinkable
not
too
overflavored
smooth
and
balanced
this
beer
pours
a
very
very
clear
yet
nice
gold
in
color
with
a
one
finger
bright
white
head
it
is
very
light
in
body
but
very
well
carbonated
the
aromas
are
of
yeast
a
honey
like
sweetness
and
nice
coriandercitrus
zest
it
smells
pretty
damn
good
the
flavors
are
of
sweet
pale
malts
light
honey
spices
and
orange
peels
it
has
a
nice
crisp
bite
to
it
the
flavor
isnt
quite
as
good
as
the
aromas
but
its
pretty
solid
it
drinks
well
and
is
an
excellent
option
for
a
hot
summers
day
overall
im
kind
of
impressed
by
this
one
o
im
going
to
buy
a
six
pack
for
sure
if
i
had
bought
a
sixer
to
begin
with
i
wouldnt
have
been
disappointed
tangy
sweet
apple
notes
leads
off
the
flavor
too
zippy
with
a
little
bit
of
earthy
dandelion
and
residual
herbal
hop
bitterness
light
orange
citrus
in
the
first
few
sips
that
becomes
indistinct
later
on
giving
way
to
the
apple
and
herbal
notes
light
bodied
and
easy
drinking
great
summer
session
candidate
flavor
is
coarse
and
dry
presumably
from
the
addition
of
oats
and
offers
bready
lemon
notes
and
a
bit
of
spice
on
the
finish
offers
a
smooth
and
fullbready
feel
with
a
light
hint
of
bitterness
overall
a
bit
dense
and
not
overly
refreshing
for
the
style
yet
pleasant
enough
i
would
not
expect
anything
less
from
new
belgium
very
easy
drinking
for
a
hot
day
but
still
packed
with
intricacies
drinability
one
of
the
smoothest
ive
had
it
drinks
very
well
a
great
summer
beer
o
this
is
a
very
tasty
blonde
ale
very
high
on
the
sessionable
scale
o
this
is
pretty
much
in
the
new
belgium
simple
summer
beer
style
ala
skinny
dip
but
its
better
than
that
beer
and
is
clearly
well
made
worth
a
purchase
in
my
opinion
overall
a
great
summer
beer
bolder
flavors
and
a
bigger
body
make
this
a
great
sessionable
brew
o
this
beer
was
good
is
it
something
i
would
drink
a
lot
of
maybe
not
a
nice
clean
tasting
summertime
beer
nothing
over
the
top
special
about
this
beer
but
i
did
enjoy
it
the
abv
doesnt
show
up
much
overall
another
nice
beer
from
new
belgium
overall
i
thought
this
was
a
good
light
easy
drinking
blonde
ale
that
would
for
sure
hit
the
spot
on
a
hot
summer
day
everything
was
pretty
on
par
for
its
style
and
good
the
only
thing
i
would
change
is
to
have
the
finish
be
a
little
less
bitter
and
maybe
make
the
body
a
tad
bit
lighter
this
brew
had
great
drinkability
i
could
easily
put
down
three
or
four
of
these
while
playing
disc
golf
in
the
summer
if
new
belgium
was
available
in
michigan
i
would
probably
buy
a
couple
six
packs
during
the
summer
to
enjoy
but
since
they
arent
ill
have
to
enjoy
the
two
i
have
if
you
have
access
to
new
belgium
and
want
a
good
light
summertime
beer
then
you
might
want
to
give
somersault
a
try
so
far
the
two
beers
i
have
had
from
new
belgium
have
been
good
i
hope
the
third
one
i
have
is
just
as
good
another
seasonal
with
that
signature
fat
tire
biscuit
maltiness
i
like
balance
but
i
really
prefer
my
summer
beer
to
be
lighter
and
more
uplifting
the
sour
flash
at
the
end
of
the
drink
is
a
nice
surprise
decent
effort
but
i
think
ill
stick
with
a
nice
wheat
beer
always
nice
to
see
new
faces
in
the
mixed
sixer
section
this
member
pours
a
clear
brass
topped
by
a
healthy
finger
of
eversoslightly
offwhite
foam
the
nose
comprises
coriander
wheat
light
grapefruit
peel
very
light
caramel
and
light
orange
zest
the
taste
holds
notes
of
heftier
yet
still
mild
caramel
coriander
light
lemon
zest
light
butter
mandarin
oranges
and
light
grapefruit
zest
the
body
is
a
slightly
hefty
light
with
a
very
light
moderate
carbonation
and
a
nearly
crisp
finish
overall
a
nice
little
blonde
no
pretenses
toward
anything
but
refreshment
and
this
brew
delivers
in
that
area
not
bad
poured
a
pretty
clear
golden
color
into
the
sa
perfect
pint
glass
nice
creamy
white
head
that
hung
around
for
a
couple
minutes
and
nice
lacing
not
a
whole
lot
on
the
nose
malt
a
little
yeast
and
some
flowering
overtones
taste
was
pretty
decent
malt
biscut
some
citrusy
flavor
and
no
bitterness
whatsoever
not
bad
for
a
summer
brew
i
guess
but
there
are
better
ones
out
there
doubtful
id
seek
this
one
out
again
o
this
will
be
a
nice
summer
beer
nothing
over
the
top
and
every
bit
as
good
as
skinny
dip
a
welcome
change
to
the
summer
line
up
this
will
be
nice
to
sip
on
as
the
weather
continues
to
warm
up
i
would
have
no
problem
having
a
few
of
these
at
a
barbeque
or
out
camping
nice
light
refreshing
beer
good
summer
seasonal
not
too
much
jumps
out
at
me
with
this
guy
its
the
lightest
tasting
ale
ive
ever
had
its
almost
tasteless
in
a
way
but
very
refreshing
its
not
sweet
not
bitter
not
watery
not
much
of
anything
but
refreshing
the
smell
is
pleasent
but
nothing
different
the
color
is
nice
and
light
and
the
head
is
average
i
recommend
as
a
nice
session
beer
this
is
a
very
nice
summertime
session
beer
easy
drinking
and
tasty
i
was
disappointed
to
hear
that
the
werent
bringing
skinny
dip
back
but
somersault
is
good
as
the
skinny
o
not
a
bad
beer
but
nothing
to
look
forward
to
either
i
could
see
myself
again
drinking
one
in
the
summer
at
a
bbq
or
something
if
it
was
there
but
wont
go
out
of
my
way
to
drink
it
d
such
a
refreshing
beer
from
nbit
is
nice
to
have
a
balanced
but
still
pleasantly
hopped
session
beer
this
is
definitely
a
beer
i
will
come
back
to
this
summer
o
a
decent
summer
beer
light
and
clean
with
some
pleasant
flavors
a
good
effort
o
a
nice
spring
ale
refreshing
crisp
and
clean
but
not
too
flavorful
probably
wont
be
picking
up
any
sixers
of
this
oh
well
drinkability
is
average
because
my
palate
just
cant
wrap
itself
around
the
total
package
that
is
somersault
my
summer
can
do
without
this
beer
o
just
an
average
ale
for
meeasy
to
drink
but
not
alot
of
intrest
in
this
on
picked
up
a
spring
folly
pack
in
which
this
beer
is
featured
not
much
to
say
i
wasnt
extremely
impressed
like
i
was
with
mighty
arrow
its
sort
of
a
pale
ranger
very
very
earthy
takes
you
to
the
meadow
pictured
on
the
label
probably
wont
pick
it
up
separately
but
be
sure
to
pick
up
nbbs
folly
packs
theyre
amazing
and
are
better
than
most
beers
in
your
local
market
stay
thirsty
my
friends
overall
an
easydrinker
but
somehow
doesnt
hit
the
spot
for
me
the
grassy
hop
bitterness
grows
tiresome
over
time
its
a
tasty
beer
but
skinny
dip
and
sunshine
wheat
are
better
in
their
summery
type
range
of
offerings
very
refreshing
summer
seasonal
as
they
should
be
i
highly
enjoyed
this
offering
o
a
pleasant
quaff
will
be
good
for
the
warmer
weather
and
i
can
see
spending
some
time
with
this
on
the
front
porch
a
couple
of
months
from
now
also
has
potential
as
a
brew
to
lure
the
uninitiated
away
from
bigmegacorpswill
compared
to
the
beer
this
replaced
skinny
dip
id
say
new
belgium
hit
this
one
out
of
the
park
its
not
a
great
beer
by
any
means
but
it
will
be
a
mainstay
in
my
summer
fridge
very
nicely
put
together
another
amazing
product
from
an
amazing
american
owned
company
definitely
a
good
summer
drinker
this
will
probably
make
it
into
the
fridge
once
or
twice
more
before
fall
nothing
special
very
pale
annoyingly
bland
after
two
good
full
flavored
beer
hint
of
wheat
overtones
light
enough
for
summer
consumption
but
full
flavored
enough
to
enjoy
anytime
would
pair
well
with
salads
sea
food
fish
tacos

oz
can
pours
a
clear
golden
yellow
with
a
nice
white
head
there
was
no
real
and
defiant
smell
to
the
beer
taste
is
pretty
bland
for
a
summer
beer
there
is
no
stand
out
ingredient
that
really
screams
summer
mouthfeel
is
a
lightly
carbonated
beer
that
hangs
around
for
a
little
bit
overall
its
a
little
below
average
and
really
not
worth
it
t6pp
overall
better
than
the
narragansett
lager
and
a
bit
more
expensive
coming
in
at
just
over
8sixer
here
in
boston
however
for
this
price
and
quantity
16oz
cans
id
be
hard
pressed
to
find
a
better
sessionable
summer
beer
that
doesnt
blast
me
with
hops
would
definitely
recommend
especially
if
youre
looking
for
a
partybbq
beer
overall
solid
session
ale
with
a
nice
drinkable
balanced
character
good
beer
for
cookouts
and
outdoor
gatherings
nothing
fancy
but
something
tasty
this
is
a
nice
light
beer
that
is
easily
quaffable
there
isnt
much
here
in
the
way
of
flavor
but
it
is
refreshing
and
easy
to
drink
straight
from
the
can
this
is
a
great
bmc
replacement
beer
as
well
as
a
light
lawnmower
or
tailgate
beer
overall
a
good
summer
beer
hard
to
see
anyone
not
liking
it
not
going
to
be
anyones
favorite
but
it
is
what
you
expect
it
to
be
it
has
no
redeeming
qualities
other
than
i
assume
its
dirt
cheap
overall
this
is
decent
summer
fare
with
a
good
arrangement
of
flavors
in
decent
quantities
the
beer
obviously
designed
to
be
light
crisp
and
refreshing
while
still
maintaining
good
flavors
and
succeeding
very
nicely
in
doing
so
its
a
bit
of
a
shame
that
the
initial
flavors
couldnt
last
longer
and
that
the
hops
come
to
so
heavily
dominate
the
beer
over
time
but
this
is
still
a
very
nice
brew
overall
great
for
the
warm
weather
or
anything
outdoors
will
be
picking
this
one
up
again
notes
heftier
than
any
other
blonde
ale
ive
had
reminds
me
of
an
english
bitter
well
done
what
a
solid
refreshing
take
on
all
of
the
generic
summer
ales
that
come
around
this
has
the
flavor
and
character
of
a
good
lager
and
yet
the
thickness
of
an
ale
that
gives
me
the
best
of
two
worlds
its
not
complex
by
any
means
but
maybe
i
wouldnt
want
to
have
a
super
complex
beer
every
day
of
the
week
and
by
no
means
when
im
out
and
about
on
a
picnic
or
beach
someplace
this
is
nearly
a
british
session
beer
and
i
could
consume
many
in
a
row
three
of
their
beers
in
im
yet
to
find
a
brewery
as
narragansett
that
does
offerings
this
simple
and
equally
enjoyable
as
they
do
overall
3
5
it
is
what
it
is
its
not
perfect
its
not
exceptional
but
its
plenty
easy
to
drink
and
pleasant
in
all
the
ways
that
count
exceptional
in
any
way
no
great
in
any
way
no
very
good
in
any
way
maybe
if
its
hot
out
and
you
didnt
expect
to
see
this
kind
of
beer
around
its
just
fine
and
thats
fine
by
me
glad
i
got
a
sixer
because
this
is
an
easy
going
beer
an
easy
summer
drinker
not
remarkable
but
good
enough
flavor
o
great
summer
beer
its
almost
like
a
light
pale
ale
if
that
makes
sense
you
get
the
flavors
of
a
pale
ale
but
with
less
bitterness
impressive
that
gansett
pulled
this
off
golden
beer
with
a
thick
foamy
head
that
dissipates
slowly
and
leaves
lots
of
lacing
crisp
grass
and
zesty
lemon
aromas
with
some
floral
hints
flavors
of
grasses
and
grain
with
soft
lemon
rind
notes
has
a
light
dry
body
that
makes
it
perfect
for
cooling
off
on
a
hot
summer
day
clear
golden
yellow
with
a
tall
thick
white
head
this
beer
produces
some
beautiful
lace
the
beer
is
light
in
complexion
and
fruity
in
aroma
estery
slight
malt
a
touch
of
herbal
hops
distant
citrus
nice
the
flavor
is
light
as
is
the
body
nice
for
summer
but
it
does
give
us
a
little
complexity
and
intensity
slight
sweetness
but
the
finish
is
abrupt
good
summer
brew
i
purchased
a
6pack
of
these
cans
for
the
beach
and
they
absolutely
hit
the
spot
it
was
light
enough
to
be
enjoyable
with
a
refreshing
and
clean
flavor
profile
and
theyre
priced
just
right
o
not
bad
for
a
summer
ale
ill
definitely
drink
another
o
this
beer
is
very
easy
to
drink
and
is
a
perfect
beer
for
the
summer
it
has
a
bit
of
citrusy
flavors
similar
to
a
west
coast
ipa
but
these
are
very
subdued
this
is
a
nice
summer
beer
very
drinkable
overall
good
definitely
a
little
tame
but
nice
hopsflavor
for
the
low
abvstyle
easy
drinkability
and
price
will
probably
make
this
a
regular
summer
purchase
for
me
a
good
blonde
ale
with
a
noticable
hop
presence
a
bit
grainy
and
the
hop
bitterness
lingers
but
still
quite
refreshing

its
good

it
isa
summertime
quaffer
malt
flavor
with
a
touch
of
grain
that
wasnt
present
in
the

theres
a

crispness
to
keep
the
body
spritzy
an
excellent

carbonated

this
beer
isnt
trying
to
blow
you
away
which
actually
works
perfectly
im
not
really
a
fan
of
the
style
but
id
definitely
buy
this
again

superdrinkable
a
lot
more
to
this
one
than
i
thought
there
would
be
really
good
o
not
a
bad
beer
it
was
an
enjoyable
beer
im
glad
i
got
a
sixpack
of
this
i
would
definitely
have
this
again
o
this
beer
is
very
refreshing
enjoyable
and
easy
to
drink
i
would
love
to
have
another
one
of
these
it
was
surprisingly
good
not
that
i
should
be
too
surprised
as
i
have
liked
each
of
the
beers
i
have
had
from
them
the
hopforward
flavor
with
the
grapefruit
hops
was
quite
enjoyable
another
workman
brew
from
narragansett
nothing
wrong
with
this
one
just
a
decent
beer
at
a
good
price
o
this
is
a
simple
and
insanely
drinkable
beer
it
is
significantly
more
appealing
in
the
warm
weather
omg
i
wasnt
expecting
what
i
got
form
this
beer
honestly
i
used
to
think
new
belgium
hoptober
was
the
best
blonde
but
nope
theres
an
amazing
balance
and
i
think
thats
the
key
here
light
upfront
bitterness
thats
kept
in
check
by
a
subtly
sweet
malt
its
all
so
light
and
a
perfect
summer
beer
clear
yellow
color
with
a
frothy
white
head
mild
juicy
oily
citrus
aroma
over
some
fresh
grain
simple
and
pleasant
increased
grainy
sweetness
comes
through
in
the
flavor
with
some
earthiness
and
a
snappy
citrus
zest
finish
light
bodied
well
carbonated
very
crisp
and
damn
drinkable
this
is
nothing
outstanding
but
its
a
perfect
refresher
for
the
beach
i
personally
like
a
little
more
crackerbiscuit
malt
in
my
blondes
but
this
is
tasty
asis
this
would
fit
in
with
a
cooler
full
of
hoppy
pilsners
quite
well
i
am
shocked
highly
drinkable
with
nice
balance
of
bitter
and
malty
with
nice
hop
character
i
would
buy
this
again
o
a
nice
simple
and
refreshing
summer
beer
that
is
extremely
sessionable
the
price
is
great
too
at
only
8
49
for
a
sixer
of
pounders
i
think
ive
found
my
new
summer
beer
you
should
be
this
thanks
o
overall
i
thought
this
was
a
really
good
light
blonde
ale
there
is
some
nice
citrus
hops
to
it
and
a
lot
of
wheat
and
bready
malts
not
super
flavorful
but
a
really
nice
summer
beer
and
way
better
then
most
lighter
beer
options
would
have
it
again
poured
into
a
nonic
gansett
summer
presents
itself
beautifully
with
a
clear
straw
gold
body
and
a
thick
fluffy
white
head
that
hangs
out
for
a
while
aroma
is
modest
but
good
with
a
distinct
citrus
component
mingling
with
sweet
and
grainy
notes
its
flavor
is
modest
as
well
but
well
done
it
is
a
4
2
summer
beer
after
all
there
is
just
a
faint
hint
of
the
citrus
coming
thru
but
is
second
to
a
very
crisp
clean
refreshing
malt
profile
which
seems
as
though
there
is
some
wheat
in
there
too
which
lightens
the
whole
affair
the
mouthfeel
is
nice
and
creamy
however
i
gotta
say
the
lacing
on
this
one
is
impressive
overall
a
very
well
done
summer
blonde
crisp
clean
and
to
the
point
although
those
looking
for
a
more
robust
flavored
summer
beer
oberon
hop
sun
may
be
dissapointed
but
for
what
it
is
a
clean
lower
alcohol
summer
ale
i
enjoyed
it
and
would
probably
get
it
again
o
this
is
going
to
become
my
goto
this
summer
tasty
light
refreshing
cheap
and
it
comes
in
tallboy
cans
love
this
feel
is
light
bodied
with
light
carbonation
just
enough
to
keep
the
beer
from
dying
at
the
end
not
bitter
not
overly
sweet
a
simple
american
blond
i
could
drink
a
lot
of
this
stuff
at
4
2
o
probably
my
favorite
summer
ale
and
my
favorite
sessioncanbbqbeach
beer
fits
the
bill
perfectly
what
are
you
waiting
for
grab
a
gansett
by
far
the
best
summer
ale
available
for
the
price
after
reading
the
profile
on
the
website
i
was
very
surprised
to
see
the
addition
of
citra
hops
to
the
recipe
i
look
forward
to
this
every
summer
recommended
an
alright
blonde
ale
just
not
enough
flavor
to
get
too
amped
up
about
thanks
to
rubby
for
passing
this
on
for
a
try
this
summer
treat
is
an
anemic
gold
color
with
few
signs
of
life
but
it
does
produce
a
voluptuous
white
crown
of
foam
and
gobs
of
lacing
in
retreat
the
nose
picks
up
a
pretty
pungent
skunky
wheat
bread
with
a
hint
of
cider
hard
to
say
whether
this
is
good
or
not
so
good
but
im
giving
it
the
benefit
of
the
doubt
im
thirsty
the
flavor
is
light
but
not
at
all
complacent
as
i
get
more
skunky
bread
wheat
and
sunny
citrus
hop
very
crisp
with
a
delicate
but
deliberate
carbonation
that
peppers
the
palate
pretty
aggressively
this
is
clearly
a
nice
choice
for
sessioningpartying
light
bodied
near
watery
but
held
together
by
the
lively
feel
lots
of
bread
and
a
tasteful
hint
of
bright
hops
to
make
this
a
very
serviceable
thirst
quencher
take
it
out
on
narragansett
bay
the
next
time
you
push
off
from
the
docks
at
the
east
greenwich
yacht
club
bring
some
chips
and
salsa
and
a
few
ghandi
bots
for
dessert
and
all
you
need
is
a
good
friend
or
two
to
make
it
a
great
evening
d
i
was
pleasantly
suprised
with
this
beer
flavorful
and
interesting
i
could
drink
these
all
day
at
4
2
abv
this
is
a
great
summer
beer
perfect
while
your
roasting
on
the
beach
or
hanging
out
at
a
backyard
bbq
the
nose
has
corn
flora
light
citrus
it
has
a
taste
that
is
reminiscient
of
honey
bunches
of
oats
or
a
similar
cereal
malts
also
come
through
along
with
some
more
light
citrus
mf
leans
towards
light
a
fairly
crisp
and
dry
aftertaste
a
pretty
solid
summer
beer
that
i
picked
out
of
my
basement
before
moving
on
to
some
autumn
beers
soon
this
beer
pours
a
nice
yellow
color
with
a
thin
white
head
the
smell
is
grassy
floral
and
citrus
hops
with
a
light
background
of
malt
bthe
flavor
is
similar
to
the
smell
with
a
smooth
clean
finish
bthe
mouthfeel
is
light
and
almost
thirt
quenching
overall
this
is
an
excellent
summe
beer
thanks
to
victory4me
for
sharing
this
pint
can
into
a
standard
pint
glass
pours
golden
yellow
with
a
large
3fingered
white
head
that
even
after
some
time
still
was
almost
a
fingers
worth
lacing
was
thin
but
present
throughout
nose
is
sweet
with
elements
of
lemon
grain
and
toasted
malt
taste
was
lemongrass
sweet
malts
and
hints
of
grassy
hops
the
finish
is
dry
crisp
and
light
the
mouthfeel
was
on
the
light
side
as
expected
and
mildly
carbonated
this
was
a
pleasant
surprise
and
reported
inexpensive
would
be
a
goto
summer
standbyexcept
we
dont
get
it
here
that
i
am
aware
of
overall
i
have
to
give
this
a
4
5
rating
it
is
a
very
drinkable
and
a
very
tasty
summer
ale
just
what
an
ale
like
this
should
be
d
overall
a
pretty
decent
summer
session
beer
light
bodied
full
of
flavor
lower
on
the
abv
side
o
definitely
nothing
complex
very
drinkable
as
it
is
intended
to
be
best
summer
beer
of
2011
to
bad
i
found
these
late
in
the
season
would
have
been
my
summer
choice
pours
a
very
pale
yellow
with
a
slight
bright
white
head
aroma
of
sweet
citra
hops
and
toasted
grains
great
summer
flavor
begins
with
a
good
hit
of
those
delicious
citra
hops
grain
and
cereal
malt
add
great
balance
and
sweetness
before
a
crisp
hop
finish
flavor
profile
is
not
huge
but
perfectly
constructed
for
such
a
sessionable
ale
not
a
wussy
fruity
hopless
summer
beer
but
a
well
crafted
hop
and
flavor
friendly
sessionable
summer
ale
the
cpj
o
very
good
and
very
drinkable
summer
brew
this
is
definitely
my
pick
for
the
summer
o
im
not
normally
a
fan
of
summer
brews
but
gansett
made
a
wonderfully
refreshing
beer
here
hops
are
noticeable
without
smacking
you
over
the
head
which
most
hoppy
beers
do
these
days
imo
pretty
and
simple
o
really
enjoyed
this
summer
offering
from
the
boys
and
girls
at
narragansett
at
only
4
2
abv
its
extremely
sessionable
goes
down
easy
and
would
be
perfect
on
a
hot
summer
day
at
the
beach
the
best
of
the
best
for
summer
beers
as
far
as
im
concerned
this
is
a
great
summer
brew
from
the
guys
at
narragansett
there
seasonal
brews
continue
to
impress
me
ive
probably
bought
a
case
of
this
so
far
this
summer
and
there
is
most
likely
another
six
pack
on
the
horizon
o
very
nice
summer
beer
that
is
refreshing
balanced
and
quite
tasty
the
only
challenge
with
this
beer
is
that
i
have
not
had
an
opportunity
to
get
any
more
as
demand
is
strong
cheers
o
it
really
cant
get
much
better
for
this
style
recommended
crystal
clear
and
yellowgold
in
colour
with
a
lingering
white
cap
of
fine
foam
solid
sheets
of
bubbles
coated
the
top
of
the
glass
cereal
and
grainy
aroma
along
with
zesty
citrus
and
a
hint
of
pine
moderate
bitterness
provided
balance
for
bready
malt
sweetness
more
citrusy
hops
cereal
grains
slightly
metallic
and
bitter
in
the
finish
rich
creamy
texture
light
to
medium
bodied
with
moderate
carbonation
fairly
dry
i
really
enjoyed
this
a
solid
summer
ale
o
hmm
what
to
say
about
this
im
pleasantly
surprised
and
disappointed
all
at
the
same
time
i
had
heard
from
a
number
of
trusted
bas
how
good
this
beer
is
and
finally
got
around
to
trying
it
well
it
is
way
better
than
i
expected
it
to
be
when
i
first
saw
this
on
the
shelves
earlier
this
summer
but
i
had
heard
what
a
nice
hop
profile
this
has
and
i
just
dont
get
it
maybe
this
has
been
on
the
shelves
or
actually
fridge
of
the
beer
store
for
a
while
and
the
hops
have
faded
some
but
it
just
wasnt
as
expected
however
this
is
definitely
a
better
than
passable
summer
thirst
quencher
a
day
of
working
in
the
yard
a
round
of
golf
a
day
on
the
deck
or
at
the
pool
this
will
work
fine
a
bargain
for
96er
of
16oz
cans
but
not
enough
to
it
to
make
it
into
my
regular
summer
rotation
overall
not
bad
better
than
i
expected
nice
flavors
hints
of
grassy
mild
hops
but
a
bit
watery
and
way
too
light
o
for
the
style
it
doesnt
get
any
better
highly
recommended
light
gold
colored
beer
with
a
slowly
fading
head
aroma
is
very
light
frutiness
taste
is
dominated
by
hops
and
pine
needles
another
disgusting
over
hopped
beer
that
makes
it
taste
like
pinesol
i
would
not
recommend
and
will
be
very
lucky
to
get
through
this
crap
the
flavor
is
delicious
i
could
throw
back
several
of
these
in
a
session
perfectly
balanced
and
teeming
with
flavor
this
is
certainly
a
top
notch
example
of
the
style
i
definitely
want
more
of
this
recommended
with
so
many
better
summer
seasonals
available
i
wouldnt
recommend
but
be
sure
to
try
for
yourself
beer
is
medium
to
light
in
body
moderately
carbonated
on
the
palate
and
good
throughout
the
finish
isnt
dry
or
bitter
just
a
nice
finish
with
no
aftertaste
the
lead
off
is
a
little
sweet
mild
malt
intermediate
levels
of
yeast
character
on
the
middle
and
a
clean
finish
id
have
it
again
unoffensive
sort
of
a
perfect
circle
sort
of
beer
overall
a
tasty
summer
refresher
simple
and
quaffable
over
the
past
few
months
ive
been
able
to
drink
a
lot
of
fantastic
beers
from
all
over
the
country
but
this
one
might
be
the
mvp
of
the
summer
its
perfectly
priced
extremely
refreshing
highly
drinkable
and
it
appeals
to
both
craft
and
noncraft
drinkers
d
this
really
floored
me
ive
never
been
a
fan
of
narragansetts
flagship
even
by
aal
standards
but
this
is
a
very
flavorful
wonderful
refreshing
summer
beer
the
weight
of
the
blue
tallboy
in
hand
is
a
great
addition
to
any
summer
afternoon
buy
it
you
wont
find
anything
better
for
the
price
pou
yields
a
bright
clear
brew
that
is
golden
in
color
with
a
thin
white
head
and
some
very
light
lacing
some
spots
though
not
all
that
much
the
nose
carries
a
bit
of
light
grain
though
not
much
of
any
accompanying
sweetness
no
real
hop
presence
in
the
nose
or
flavor
though
a
bit
of
bitterness
comes
through
in
the
finish
really
plain
overall
however
something
about
the
chemistry
that
i
do
enjoy
no
hops
and
the
malt
really
brings
neither
malt
flavor
nor
sweetness
well
made
with
no
real
flaws
in
execution
kind
of
bland
but
satisfying
o
a
really
nice
flavorful
crisp
and
balanced
pale
blonde
ale
near
perfect
for
summer
and
one
of
the
best
blondes
ive
had
the
4
2
abv
means
you
can
session
at
your
backyard
bbq
or
beach
party
all
day
long
o
goes
down
easily
extremely
tasty
not
filling
not
much
of
a
kick
and
a
great
representation
of
style
hellooo
if
the
local
liquor
stores
can
keep
up
with
the
demand
you
shall
be
my
summer
beer
this
beer
far
exceeded
my
expectations
this
is
a
damn
fine
summer
ale
and
a
damn
fine
beer
all
around
the
distribution
of
narragansett
is
limited
but
if
you
can
get
your
hands
on
this
try
it
now
pours
a
nice
cleanclear
golden

nice

with
some
nice
sticky

left
behind
the

with
a

the
taste

sweet
malty
slightly
hoppy

a
nice

excellent
thirst
quencher
on
a
hot
day
its
great
to
see
the
narragansett
name
out
there
again
low
abv
clean
and
enjoyable
flavors
really
an
excellent
beer
for
the
summer
season
or
any
season
nice
can
too
im
glad
to
see
gansett
changed
it
up
from
the
overly
bready
sa
summer
and
oberon
this
is
a
perfect
gateway
selection
for
those
who
are
scared
of
nonyellow
beer
ive
been
enjoying
it
for
about
a
month
and
it
certainly
holds
up
to
a
thorough
inspection
rich
amber
in
color
light
with
a
nice
head
of
white
on
top
lots
of
carbonation
coming
up
toward
the
surface
throughout
the
session
reinforcing
an
already
strong
look
light
hops
get
stronger
as
it
warms
up
nice
bit
of
grain
mixing
in
as
well
now
nice
depth
to
it
i
have
to
admit
crisp
clean
taste
and
feel
here
really
again
very
well
done
i
have
to
say
light
finish
which
was
quite
dry
and
i
have
to
admit
this
was
very
very
session
able
you
never
can
tell
what
is
going
to
happen
when
you
try
a
new
pale
ale
but
this
was
surprisingly
very
good
a
big
shout
out
to
woodychandler
for
the
hook
up
poured
from
a
16
oz
can
has
a
golden
color
with
a
1
inch
head
smell
is
of
hops
some
grains
taste
is
a
good
hopmalt
balance
some
citrus
flavor
feels
medium
bodied
in
the
mouth
and
overall
is
a
refreshing
and
enjoyable
beer
mouthfeel
is
crisp
and
refreshing
and
at
only
4
2
this
is
pretty
light
overall
im
really
enjoying
this
and
i
think
the
brewers
hit
the
nail
on
the
head
with
a
light
refreshing
summer
beer
that
has
more
flavor
than
your
typical
summer
beer
a
little
bit
heavier
than
i
would
preffer
for
the
style
and
the
carbonation
is
very
soft
not
a
bad
light
summer
beer
here
narragansett
again
makes
a
pretty
kickin
seasonal
o
if
this
was
available
in
my
area
it
would
be
my
goto
beer
throughout
the
hot
weather
season
what
an
impressive
beer
that
absolutely
nails
what
it
set
out
to
do
o
surprisingly
not
bad
old
school
fifties
aura
meets
modern
attempt
to
appeal
to
broader
more
discerning
audiences
with
mixed
results
this
is
a
good
beer
to
get
thoughtless
with
grab
a
few
hit
the
roof
deck
with
friends
and
just
chill
with
some
music
it
tries
to
work
in
some
more
complexity
than
its
flagship
predecessor
but
stumbles
as
much
as
it
strides
as
the
light
fruitiness
and
the
hops
progress
but
the
discrepancy
between
that
and
the
sour
middle
mediocre
aftertaste
weigh
this
beer
down
overall
best
thing
i
have
had
from
gansett
and
what
i
would
describe
as
a
perfect
lawnmower
beer
enough
strength
and
beer
taste
to
quench
the
thrist
and
keep
on
going
complex
enough
to
make
me
want
the
full
six
side
note
along
with
my
inexpensive
6pack
of
tallboy
cans
i
got
a
free
neck
tie
it
is
polyester
blue
with
anchors
and
the
traditional
naragansett
hi
neighbor
cant
imagine
actually
wearing
it
but
found
it
quite
amusing
the
crack
glug
produced
two
dense
fingers
of
rocky
bonewhite
head
with
decent
retention
color
was
a
deep
goldenyellow
with
nequality
clarity
and
an
abundance
of
visible
co2
bubbles
nose
had
an
interesting
lemony
citrus
scent
mouthfeel
was
very
full
thanks
to
all
of
the
carbonation
there
was
a
light
pine
hoppiness
along
with
the
lemon
citrusiness
noted
on
the
nose
finish
was
quite
dry
and
refreshing
and
i
realized
that
i
should
have
been
outside
on
this
warm
afternoon
to
drink
it
rather
than
inside
at
the
keyboard
this
definitely
rates
a
place
in
the
cooler
flavors
of
cereal
grains
caramel
malts
with
a
mini
hop
snap
on
the
finish
some
light
fruit
flavors
like
apple
or
pear
too
with
a
hint
of
lemon
zest
i
really
like
the
soft
mouthfeel
of
this
beer
and
high
drinkability
level
why
couldnt
they
market
this
as
their
light
beer
regardless
a
decent
example
o
a
good
summer
beer
that
ill
be
drinking
a
lot
of
this
summer
the
beer
reminded
me
of
craft
brewery
takes
on
the
cream
ale
it
started
off
with
a
light
somewhat
cream
bread
taste
and
then
a
spicy
citrus
hop
finish
its
simple
but
a
tasty
session
option
sampled
at
the
ba
craft
brew
fest
on
june
3
2011
the
pour
is
a
hazy
goldenyellow
with
a
bit
of
a
fizzy
white
head
up
front
on
the
nose
there
seems
to
be
a
sweetish
malt
character
above
anything
else
with
a
little
hint
of
citrus
zing
the
body
was
a
bit
better
than
average
in
the
medium
range
the
taste
was
quite
sweet
at
the
start
but
then
evolved
into
a
butternut
citrus
circus
and
a
slightly
dryer
finish
pretty
good
summer
this
is
the
best
new
beer
ive
had
in
a
long
time
and
solid
proof
that
narragansetts
rebirth
is
on
solid
footing
its
a
hell
of
a
lot
more
than
hi
neighbor
nostalgia
proof
that
you
can
make
a
refreshing
lawnmower
beer
with
plenty
of
character
that
brings
the
flavor
but
at
4
2
abv
doesnt
knock
you
on
your
ass
illl
be
drinking
a
lot
of
this
this
is
a
very
easy
drinking
beer
that
has
a
well
balanced
flavor
very
refreshing
and
with
4
2
abv
you
can
enjoy
a
few
while
camping
or
at
a
bbq
overall
one
that
i
am
glad
to
have
tried
but
dont
need
to
have
again
of
gansetts
four
seasonals
this
one
was
my
least
favorite
wow
it
seems
like
every
summer
ale
is
lemon
this
or
wheat
that
narraganset
does
an
english
mildipa
with
a
perfect
balance
of
macro
beer
and
session
ale
this
beer
would
be
amazing
on
cask
such
a
unique
style
this
might
actually
give
the
gansett
bock
a
run
for
the
money
this
is
much
better
than
most
summer
ales
ive
had
gansett
summer
for
example
makes
an
embarrassment
out
of
sam
adamss
summer
offering
im
so
glad
this
brewery
came
back
from
the
dead
they
should
brew
a
beer
called
zombie
gansett
the
feel
of
this
beer
is
pretty
light
there
is
a
slight
push
of
bitterness
but
this
beer
just
stays
smooth
and
then
is
gone
down
before
any
real
notice
d
drinkability
is
high
and
this
is
a
great
beer
for
just
sitting
on
the
beach
i
found
it
to
be
more
enjoyable
straight
from
the
can
then
when
poured
and
i
am
glad
that
i
have
a
case
to
tide
me
over
for
memorial
day
weekend
o
very
tasty
goes
down
quite
easily
not
filling
at
all
mild
kick
good
representation
of
style
this
is
an
excellent
bbq
beer
to
pound
down
for
a
very
long
time
i
bought
a
six
pack
this
year
as
soon
as
it
appeared
on
the
shelves
in
the
past
year
i
have
had
some
remarkably
mediocre
summer
beers
and
american
blonde
ales
as
a
result
i
am
bumping
this
to
a
4
5
overall
its
not
a
mindblowing
beer
but
it
is
one
of
the
best
of
this
style
o
this
is
quite
a
nice
summer
brew
and
definitely
worth
picking
up
for
the
price
i
thought
it
was
going
to
be
a
bit
better
than
it
was
but
again
not
at
all
disappointed
it
must
be
noted
that
its
an
extremely
drinkable
brew
quaffable
summer
ale
a
solid
brew
all
around
medium
bodied
with
the
carbonation
on
the
light
side
of
medium
im
digging
the
mouth
feel
and
if
i
had
this
around
my
neck
of
the
woods
regularly
id
drink
a
heck
of
a
lot
of
it
wonderful
brew

head
eventually
settles
into
a
18th

with
delicate
strands
of

encircling
the
shoulders
nose
is
light
and
pleasant
wheat
citrus
apricot
and
a
kiss
of
floral
hops
taste
consistent
with
nose
with
the
floral
hops
character
present
in
the
nose
revealing
itself
at
the
finish
really
quite
flavorful
for
such
a
low
abv
beer
mouthfeel
is
light
in
body
with
a
refreshing
palate
cleansing
carbonation
and
a
semidry
finish
this
is
a
fantastic
session
beer
and
the
16oz
tallboys
make
it
perfect
for
summer
i
see
this
as
becoming
a
staple
in
my
fridge
over
the
coming
months
o
overall
this
is
a
damn
good
beer
from
narragansett
and
quite
possibly
my
favorite
seasonal
of
theirs
for
the
price

hands
down
my
new
summer
session
beer
poured
into
an
imperial
pint
glass
luckily
as
the
three
finger
cream
colored
head
was
barely
contained
the
head
falls
slowly
to
a
half
inch
blanket
decent
lacing
the
brew
is
golden
yellow
in
color
the
nose
is
some
hop
tartness
fruit
citrus
a
little
grain
and
slight
malt
sweetness
the
taste
is
very
clean
and
crisp
a
nice
blend
of
mild
hops
and
light
sweetness
finishes
quite
dry
with
a
slight
bitterness
the
body
is
light
with
active
carbonation
a
touch
course
overall
a
good
summer
drinker
and
a
great
value
to
boot
question
why
is
this
classified
as
a
blonde
ale
on
this
site
when
the
folks
at
narragansett
clearly
labeled
it
a
pale
ale
it
certainly
tastes
more
like
a
blonde
ale
but
if
theyre
going
to
call
it
a
pale
ale
im
going
to
rate
it
as
such
would
i
buy
more
of
it
i
would
and
i
will
the
price
for
a
sixpack
is
hard
to
pass
up
and
summer
has
just
begun
the
hottest
days
are
ahead
and
this
beer
at
16
oz
a
time
is
the
way
to
go
to
be
honest
my
first
impression
wasnt
that
great
but
as
time
went
on
i
did
come
to
appreciate
this
one
more
poured
into
an
8
oz
tester
glass
little
head
that
dissipates
quickly
nice
light
yellowgolden
color
smell
is
of
citrus
and
those
notes
come
through
on
the
taste
a
bit
at
first
it
tasted
a
little
flat
maybe
or
lacking
in
any
strong
taste
at
all
but
for
a
summery
beer
its
actually
not
too
bad
the
carbonation
was
certainly
there
nothing
here
blows
me
away
though
overall
a
crisp
and
refreshing
beer
that
i
could
certainly
drink
a
lot
of
and
isnt
this
the
point
of
a
summer
brew
o
overall
a
very
nice
summer
ale
pretty
excited
about
it
plan
to
buy
lots
more
over
the
summer
finally
finally
a
local
brew
better
than
sam
summer
quite
a
bit
better
by
my
estimate
this
beer
is
exceptionally
refreshing
and
wouldnt
lose
character
if
it
warms
up
on
a
hot
day
plus
i
mean
tallboys
16oz
tall
boy
of
course
pours
a
translucent
golden
color
with
a
half
inch
of
frothy
head
lots
of
lacing
aroma
is
of
grains
floral
hops
a
bit
of
lemon
and
some
cut
grass
taste
is
a
nice
crisp
bite
of
hops
upfront
some
breadiness
along
with
a
slight
hint
of
lemon
most
summer
brews
have
an
abusive
amount
of
lemon
flavor
but
this
one
has
only
a
bit
and
it
works
well
in
this
beer
somewhat
sweet
at
the
end
this
is
an
outstanding
summer
beer
great
balance
of
taste
and
drinkability
gansetts
newest
offerings
have
yet
to
disappoint
overall
i
will
be
drinking
my
fair
share
of
these
beers
over
the
summer
od
in
order
for
a
summer
beer
to
score
relatively
high
on
my
scale
it
needs
to
be
lightbodied
without
sacrificing
flavor
it
obviously
needs
to
be
drinkable
as
well
i
believe
that
this
beer
is
an
excellent
summer
brew
unique
taste
combined
with
light
body
doesnt
hurt
that
it
comes
in
tallboy
cans
as
well
might
be
their
best
seasonal
in
my
opinion
i
will
be
drinking
these
all
summer
636
light
and
fizzy
with
some
faint
malts
in
the
flavor
grainy
o
i
would
never
guess
this
is
a
firestone
walker
beer
its
an
introduction
to
craft
and
i
could
see
adjunct
beer
drinkers
digging
this
definitely
not
for
me
i
like
more
in
my
beer
but
this
would
make
great
lawnmower
beer
its
light
easy
drinking
nothing
overwhelming
balanced
probably
wont
buy
this
again
as
i
think
easy
jack
is
a
better
value
great
tasting
beer
no
bitterness
a
slightly
sweet
taste
with
a
moderate
malty
flavor
very
easy
drinker
an
overall
straight
ahead
take
on
a
simple
style
done
simply
1
pint
6
oz
bottle
from
bevmo
taste
is
malt
forward
with
small
hop
bitterness
and
mild
carbonation
simple
but
smooth
dry
and
clean
no
corn
or
rice
which
places
it
miles
above
the
mass
brewed
standards
i
enjoyed
this
for
what
it
is
a
refreshing
crisp
american
blonde
ale
love
the
low
abv
excellent
tasting
beer
my
goto
beer
on
my
west
coast
visits
just
wish
i
could
buy
in
ohio
great
beer
good
taste
easy
drinking
an
all
around
easy
drinking
beer
its
a
blonde
ale
nothing
experimental
or
crazy
thats
why
i
love
it
its
the
perfect
hot
weather
beer
its
a
very
drinkable
beer
a
slight
sweet
bite
at
first
taste
with
a
sweet
aromatic
finish
i
really
enjoyed
this
beer
while
visiting
cali
this
past
weekend
a
big
plus
to
find
a
beer
that
is
what
it
is
just
a
decent
local
beer
it
not
usually
a
fan
of
blonde
ales
but
this
one
makes
me
want
to
try
more
very
good
but
i
wish
was
sold
in
greater
us
nothing
special
decent
beer
with
a
light
taste
ok
it
is
what
it
is
and
theres
nothing
wrong
with
what
it
is
its
a
blonde
ale
and
thats
what
it
wants
to
be
so
comparing
it
to
something
else
is
like
comparing
a
good
pizza
to
a
good
steak
dinner
its
not
fair
to
either
this
is
the
kind
of
beer
you
drink
when
youre
having
an
impromptu
bbq
with
some
friends
on
a
nice
summer
day
if
a
refreshing
beer
is
what
you
seek
this
is
one
of
the
best
in
that
class
its
a
blonde
ale
anyone
expecting
something
inyourface
spectacular
is
looking
at
the
wrong
style
of
beer
but
for
what
it
is
it
is
really
great
crisp
clean
tasting
and
refreshing
to
drink
smell
and
taste
is
malty
and
alittle
sour
meh
quite
possibly
one
of
the
worst
beers
i
have
ever
had
i
just
dont
get
it
really
enjoyable
but
not
unique
or
memorable
as
the
popularity
suggests
its
part
of
their
typical
12
pack
and
i
usually
enjoy
this
one
after
enjoying
darker
and
hoppier
beers
i
dont
seek
it
out
but
its
usually
on
the
cheaper
side
in
norcal
its
light
flavorful
and
a
much
better
alternative
to
the
big
brewery
watered
down
beers
wouldnt
hunt
it
down
but
its
was
a
good
beer
really
enjoyable
but
not
unique
or
memorable
i
am
not
a
fan
of
blonde
ales
but
for
being
one
this
is
a
decent
beer
a
little
to
sweet
for
my
taste
though
lite
and
sharp
a
little
thin
tastes
like
miller
or
something
similar
good
carbonation
wheatgrainy
taste
nice
blond
color
one
of
my
faves
a
decent
beer
with
a
good
taste
o
nice
malty
beer
with
a
solid
hop
presence
that
is
drinkable
on
any
occasion
it
may
not
rate
well
but
in
my
book
it
rates
higher
than
it
is
on
here
and
thats
okay
keep
in
mind
this
was
on
tap
perhaps
this
one
does
not
age
very
well
in
bottles
if
thats
the
case
firestone
walker
really
needs
to
get
a
new
distributor
not
really
a
firestone
fan
at
all
or
a
american
blonde
ale
drinker
but
this
one
deserves
a
good
review
i
was
handed
one
at
a
get
together
and
hit
with
a
new
respect
for
both
the
style
of
a
balanced
blonde
ale
and
firestone
small
hop
bitterness
toasty
smell
of
barley
and
a
clean
malt
backbone
all
in
all
a
refreshing
crisp
ale
o
meh
awesome
beer
not
amazed
by
this
but
when
i
drink
a
blonde
ale
i
do
prefer
it
to
be
hoppy
and
this
one
most
certainly
is
its
darker
than
blonde
by
a
shade
or
two
honey
maybe
with
a
tall
but
short
lived
white
head
nose
of
robust
pils
malt
and
european
hops
with
more
than
balancing
bitterness
farmy
in
taste
with
a
musty
barny
funky
weirdness
that
i
dont
think
comes
from
yeast
not
quite
tang
but
funk
for
sure
the
pale
malt
is
heavy
here
old
and
rich
for
a
blonde
beer
carbonation
is
high
body
is
fuller
and
there
is
something
distinct
about
this
one
although
i
dont
love
it
all
that
much
hard
to
make
a
simple
pale
beer
distinct
these
days
and
they
succeed
at
that
but
one
bottle
is
plenty
for
me
right
now
short
of
refreshing
but
exhibiting
some
of
the
same
characteristics
im
glad
i
was
able
to
grab
one
of
these
from
lowry
liquors
those
guys
do
a
nice
job
i
never
rate
for
this
beer
i
do
overall
not
super
exciting
still
more
flavor
than
the
average
lager
great
fridge
stocker
has
a
sweet
breadlike
taste
not
bad
if
you
can
get
your
hands
on
it
on
a
hot
day
nothing
beats
it
period
great
drinkability
and
refreshing
firestone
offers
quite
a
selection
of
good
beers
and
805
is
by
far
my
go
to
beer
they
also
are
promoting
the
hell
out
of
it
so
they
obviously
have
faith
in
this
beer
as
well
have
been
to
the
both
breweries
paso
robles
and
buellton
and
loved
the
atmosphere
and
the
food
in
the
restaurants
were
great
this
is
just
funny
i
didnt
like
it
at
first
sip
and
it
didnt
improve
after
that
a
peculiar
release
from
a
great
brewery
from
the
22
oz
bottle
purchased
at
albertsons
supermarket
in
san
diego
this
is
a
very
pale
light
golden
beer
with
a
modest
but
lasting
layer
of
foam
atop
it
the
aroma
is
bordering
on
nonexistent
a
light
dusty
scent
of
hops
perhaps
some
malt
but
its
difficult
to
tell
the
flavor
is
moderately
bitter
though
hop
flavor
is
lacking
giving
away
quickly
to
a
little
sweet
malt
slightly
grainy
body
is
wellcarbonated
light
but
not
watery
this
beer
is
very
drinkable
but
also
inoffensive
and
not
memorable
at
all
honestly
its
a
pretty
good
beer
i
tend
to
lean
toward
amber
lagers
but
im
expanding
my
horizons
on
the
beer
front
that
said
its
damn
near
unbeatable
on
a
hot
day
its
almost
as
light
as
a
wheat
beer
it
manages
to
be
crisp
and
clean
but
still
pack
plenty
of
flavor
its
nice
and
malty
and
they
did
a
great
job
in
not
going
overboard
with
the
honey
it
will
be
a
staple
in
my
fridge
this
summer
and
my
goto
at
the
pub
for
my
first
round
on
a
hot
day
definitely
a
well
crafted
blonde
ale
the
malt
is
full
and
rich
with
a
snappy
hop
bite
on
the
finish
it
goes
from
white
bread
to
biscuits
to
grainy
all
in
one
sip
its
one
of
the
best
i
have
had
but
still
wont
supplant
ss
bombshell
blonde
as
my
go
to
summer
blonde
ale
this
is
a
decent
blonde
ale
that
has
bready
malt
qualities
and
a
slightly
sweet
finish
smooth
light
and
sessionable
edit
had
another
one
of
these
disliked
even
more
its
just
not
a
good
beer
overall
nothing
really
too
outstanding
here
its
refreshing
but
a
bit
lacking
in
the
flavor
department
o
im
not
digging
this
one
too
much
the
sweetness
is
a
little
too
much
o
decent
blonde
though
nothing
memorable
for
me
sessionable
though
i
would
still
prefer
more
hops
overall
all
styles
are
not
created
equal
so
hard
to
judge
a
beer
like
this
when
its
good
for
the
style
but
doesnt
do
much
to
capture
the
excitement
or
imagination
of
your
average
beer
geek
in
essence
because
the
style
is
invariably
boring
for
a
blonde
this
is
amazing
in
its
overall
balance
and
its
drinkability
its
perfect
for
a
summer
bbq
or
mowing
the
lawn
its
midnovember
but
i
think
ill
have
another
overall
a
passable
blonde
ale
it
might
convert
a
macro
drinker
toward
better
beers
probably
much
tastier
on
a
hot
summer
day
which
it
is
not
at
this
time
i
have
two
more
left
in
a
fw
variety
pack
and
might
tweak
my
review
after
drinking
those
overall
this
is
a
slightly
above
average
but
forgettable
blonde
ale
im
gladly
finishing
it
and
enjoying
the
rest
of
this
glass
but
im
not
upset
i
only
picked
up
a
single
overall
try
it
and
be
honest
with
yourself
for
what
this
beer
is
trying
to
accomplish
great
job
firestone
final
though
its
a
beer
that
everyone
can
enjoy
get
some
tritip
and
fire
up
the
grill
o
this
beer
is
so
popular
right
now
in
cali
that
you
cant
miss
it
i
was
skeptical
at
first
but
was
glad
i
dove
in
and
gave
it
a
shot
o
very
easy
to
drink
and
enjoyable
went
well
with
a
meal
drinkability
i
thought
it
was
pretty
good
felt
pretty
refreshing
and
went
down
smooth
i
like
that
citrus
flavors
were
really
good
too
o
nice
brew
but
outclassed
by
many
others
at
this
brewery
overall
decent
session
beer
but
not
extraordinary
this
beer
is
great
for
a
hot
summer
day
at
the
lake
on
a
boat
fishing
or
to
wet
you
palate
after
mowing
the
lawn
but
thats
about
it
o
above
average
but
nothing
special
refreshing
and
drinkable
overall
its
a
really
wellpolished
perfectly
balanced
but
basic
golden
ale
well
not
exactly
completely
basic
as
there
are
some
hops
to
it
and
theyre
really
quite
nice
but
its
not
trying
to
be
anything
other
than
that
is
it
any
better
than
an
inexpensive
american
lager
probably
better
than
a
german
or
czech
pils
well
thats
apples
and
oranges
ive
drank
about
45th
of
it
would
i
have
another
if
i
was
having
one
yes
i
think
so
i
wouldnt
mind
it
good
for
warm
weather
any
place
a
pilsner
might
fit
in
not
really
worth
pairing
with
food
though
o
a
decent
blonde
ale
with
high
drinkability
flavor
is
subtle
but
nice
a
slight
saison
and
wheat
character
comes
through
nothing
really
stands
out
though
o
a
very
good
sessionable
beer
that
should
be
tried
if
given
the
opportunity
to
the
verdict
not
bad
brewed
for
the
805
area
code
as
a
fresh
sessionable
ale
we
can
all
get
behind
and
enjoy
with
our
tritips
or
local
organic
sustainable
heirloom
freerange
farmtotable
artisanal
rabbit
food
its
a
good
solid
beer
with
unusual
freshness
i
do
get
how
this
beer
falls
into
fws
lineup
nicely
however
i
would
have
appreciated
something
a
bit
bolder
and
hoppier
to
rep
the
805
while
well
crafted
this
is
fairly
mediocre
wow
for
a
blonde
ale
not
something
i
would
buy
just
happend
to
aquire
but
i
did
really
enjoy
this
blonde
ale
nice
dark
blonde
in
color
with
some
nice
pure
white
head
rentention
aromas
nithing
there
but
some
sweet
malts
as
expected
but
the
flavor
was
quite
full
for
style
lots
of
slightly
sweet
malt
backbone
no
hops
but
malt
flavors
were
nice
great
with
pub
food
in
general
when
you
dont
know
what
you
are
eating
at
a
party
very
verstile
beer
for
a
beer
lover
drink
it
was
better
than
most
blondes
still
a
blonde
though
pours
a
clear
gold
with
a
foamy
bone
colored
head
that
settles
to
wisps
of
film
on
top
of
the
beer
small
dots
of
lace
form
around
the
glass
on
the
drink
down
smell
is
of
malt
grain
honey
and
some
vegetal
aromas
taste
is
much
the
same
with
a
vegetal
and
slightly
metallic
aftertaste
there
is
a
mild
bitterness
on
the
palate
with
each
sip
this
beer
has
a
lower
level
of
carbonation
with
a
slightly
crisp
mouthfeel
overall
this
is
a
pretty
poor
beer
with
some
weird
aromas
and
flavors
o
this
had
a
promising
start
but
the
simple
and
dull
taste
proved
this
one
to
be
average
at
best
and
certainly
not
one
of
firestones
better
offerings
pretty
much
an
average
blonde
but
great
for
the
summer
d
i
spend
the
entire
pint
trying
to
understand
what
this
was
there
isnt
much
head
retention
or
lace
to
this
one
the
nose
is
weak
and
offrers
some
strange
fruity
notes
and
its
taste
is
more
of
the
same
if
anything
it
tasted
like
a
weak
pale
ale
where
the
hops
werent
worked
as
much
as
they
could
at
least
it
was
easy
enough
to
drink
not
terribly
offensive
and
was
bubbly
in
the
mouth
as
far
as
everything
else
ill
pass
its
a
good
thing
this
is
brewed
for
the
local
central
coast
market
because
i
dont
think
its
necessary
to
inflict
this
beer
on
the
people
in
my
area
orange
county
not
that
good
but
completely
expected
for
the
given
style
the
color
when
poured
into
a
pint
glass
what
a
light
yellow
with
hardly
any
foam
and
not
lace
the
smell
was
of
a
weak
lack
luster
aroma
of
weak
hops
and
that
was
it
the
taste
was
of
really
weak
everything
in
a
beer
i
should
have
rated
it
a
1
all
across
not
a
good
blonde
ale
what
a
disappointment
from
a
very
good
brewery
one
of
the
worst
ales
ive
tasted
from
firestonewalker
clean
taste
mild
mouthfeel
grain

easy
to
drink
slightly
bitter
aftertaste
but
nothing
that
should
scare
any
seasoned
beeradvocate
a
decent
beer
worth
having
around
for
others
to
drink
youve
had
lots
of
iterations
of
this
beer
this
is
the
local
brewery
easy
go
to
drink
for
the
non
beer
drinker
it
is
what
it
is
you
know
what
kind
of
beer
im
describing
its
an
all
barley
version
of
bmc
basically
slightly
better
a
little
more

nothing
special
overall
a

the

adds
a

to
all
aspects
of
the
beer
vs

o
sort
of
an

beer
between

this
is
the
best
thing
ive
had
from
stillwater
in
ages
its
just
fantastic
beer
perfect
for
summer
and
a
nice
alternative
to
a
berliner
weisse
but
does
many
of
the
same
things
made
with
corn
and
rice
clever
grain
bill
to
go
with
the
wheat
in
here
hazy
and
blonde
extremely
creamy
and
leaving
gorgeous
ring
lacing
as
i
sip
it
down
and
the
head
never
settles
at
all
staying
a
few
inches
high
and
super
airy
in
the
glass
a
nose
of
subtle
brett
a
couple
of
strains
were
used
in
this
along
with
a
saison
yeast
strain
that
i
taste
a
lot
more
than
i
smell
the
taste
is
awesome
appreciable
grain
character
to
this
starchy
just
a
little
from
the
rice
i
assume
and
really
full
bodied
the
corn
may
contribute
to
some
mid
palate
sweetness
but
trio
of
yeasts
clean
up
any
and
all
residual
sugar
in
the
very
dry
finish
this
is
the
more
elegant
and
refined
side
of
brett
fermentation
not
heavy
on
the
funk
at
all
just
a
little
more
tart
and
interesting
than
a
normal
farmhouse
strain
but
it
brings
the
best
out
of
the
unique
grain
bill
tasty
and
original
beer
here
low
in
alcohol
and
very
effervescent
which
makes
it
a
bottle
i
wish
i
have
five
or
six
of
to
drink
in
a
session
instead
of
just
sharing
one
stillwater
needs
to
keep
going
in
this
direction
its
fabulous
beer
love

full
feel
to

drinkability
and
the
yeast

top

here
at

the
beer
is

effervesced

with
a
roasted

toasted
character
towards
the
end
of

the
aftertaste
is
more
of
the
toasty
and
grainy
characteristics
with
hints
of
sweetness
the
finish
is
frothy
and
effervesced
with
a
lingering
grassy
and

character
different
take
on
the
style
and
definitely
refreshing
on
a
hot

overall
great
very
recommended
slightly
funky
but
light

and
much
easier
to
drink
than
anticipated
dry

earthy

subtle

with
a
touch
of
sulfuric
funk
followed
by
grainy
adjuncts
as
well
as
some
apple
and
pear
sweetness
o
decent
beer
but
a
little
boring
and
overly
carbonated
overall
the
brew
feels
incredibly
unbalanced
and
too
out
of
kilter
on
the
funky
sense
this
isnt
for
me
this
feels
like
it
went
for
broke
and
burned
everything
in
its
path
to
get
there
o
this
beer
feels
true
to
the
claim
of
being
styled
in
prohibition
times
given
its
cloudy
unfiltered
almost
milky
appearance
its
sour
wild
taste
and
smell
is
raw
and
upfront
worth
given

you
find

not

when

beer
without

much
going
on
it
cheers
a
tasty
enough
pale
wild
ale
i
dont
quite
grok
the
insistence
on
placing
this
in
the
blonde
ale
classification
even
if
said
category
as
a
whole
is
looseygoosey
at
best
so
a
few
niggling
points
off
for
that
and
did
prewwii
beers
in
america
really
rely
on
wild
yeast
and
bacteria
for
their
fermentation
maybe
ive
got
some
further
reading
up
to
do
overall
intriguing
and
probably
a
bit
better
fresh
this
is
still
a
nice
example
of
what
brett
can
do
to
the
american
blonde
style
to
make
it
interesting
and
appealing
overall
a
great
looking
beer
that
may
have
been
just
a
touch
to
funky
for
me
would
definitely
like
to
try
again
and
reassess
the
flavor
profile
i
like
this
beer
it
is
incredibly
easy
drinking
and
has
some
wonderful
sour
characteristics
it
isnt
exactly
what
i
would
reach
for
if
i
was
in
the
mood
for
an
adjunct
lager
which
is
rare
but
it
is
what
i
would
grab
if
i
wanted
a
fancier
lawnmower
beer
it
is
recommended
o
this
would
make
for
a
really
easy
to
drink
beer
for
someone
that
is
just
getting
into
sour
beers
because
the
brett
is
not
overdone
i
really
liked
how
the
brewer
used
a
little
sourness
to
make
a
beer
brewed
with
adjunct
malts
that
doesnt
taste
bland
its
extremely
drinkable
given
its
low
alcohol
content
i
was
really
excited
to
pop
this
beer
open
because
i
honestly
had
no
idea
what
to
expect
from
it
stillwater
premium
pours
out
a
pale
golden
yellow
color
with
a
large
white
head
the
aroma
at
first
smells
like
an
adjunct
lager
with
maybe
a
touch
more
bright
citrus
as
either
the
beer
warms
or
i
get
closer
into
the
glass
more
subtle
aromas
come
out
the
musty
aspects
from
the
brett
start
to
take
over
as
well
as
a
bit
of
spicyearthy
hops
the
taste
is
again
really
interesting
it
has
the
clean
crisp
and
citrusy
lager
taste
there
but
its
subverted
by
a
heavy
amount
of
very
musty
funkiness
that
cuts
right
through
the
lager
base
like
a
knife
the
brett
funkiness
has
a
fun
time
interacting
with
the
citrus
and
hops
in
the
beer
i
dont
know
how
to
really
describe
the
feeling
of
the
funk
hitting
in
this
beer
it
almost
feels
like
the
mouthfeel
gets
thicker
when
the
funk
comes
rolling
through
even
though
it
obviously
doesnt
its
probably
due
to
a
strong
dryness
from
the
brett
that
fights
against
the
crisp
bright
and
light
lager
base
premium
might
not
be
a
beer
that
completely
succeeds
on
all
levels
but
its
interesting
enough
that
i
cant
help
but
recommend
it
o
took
a
chance
on
this
weird
beer
and
was
absolutely
rewarded
im
really
starting
to
get
hooked
on
what
stillwater
is
doing
looking
forward
to
the
next
time
i
come
across
them
4
5
d
a
pretty
unique
brew
highly
quaffable
as
the
brett
dries
things
out
i
would
enjoy
this
in
a
smaller
serving
vessel
as
it
would
make
for
some
solid
session
beer
overall
disappointing
it
just
tastes
like
the
brett
was
added
to
a
tasteless
beer
meh
half
finger
head
wit
excellent
lacing
in
a
cloudy
banana
yellow
body
aroma
of
clove
belgian
yeast
garbage
and
lemon
flavor
has
a
lot
of
corriander
and
clove
with
belgian
yeast
funk
and
light
lemon
custard
sweetness
moderate
carbonation
and
light
to
medium
body
lots
of
belgian
yeast
and
funk
character
drinkable
but
comes
across
very
simpe
not
overly
dry
o
though
this
is
my
first
one
by
stillwater
i
would
say
im
mostly
pleased
but
would
fault
myself
for
having
this
one
this
time
of
year
because
i
think
this
one
would
probably
show
its
aspects
better
in
the
warmer
months
of
the
year
ill
be
looking
for
it
next
summer
though
i
will
say
its
nice
to
see
this
in
maine
d
very
drinkable
nice
crisp
finish
with
good
brett
character
throughout
well
balanced
d
really
interesting
the
funky
notes
play
perfectly
with
the
earthy
european
hops
and
make
for
an
odd
but
endearing
little
beer
overall
4
0
to
be
honest
i
have
mixed
feelings
about
this
beer
i
get
what
brians
going
for
and
i
think
that
he
probably
did
an
excellent
job
in
creating
that
beer
but
its
not
quite
what
i
was
hoping
for
and
is
definitely
not
for
everybody
admittedly
im
a
bit
picky
when
it
comes
to
brett
funk
i
like
the
musty
dank
and
fruity
characters
but
get
a
little
sensitive
when
the
spicy
phenolic
side
of
brett
becomes
more
prominent
in
this
beer
the
latter
is
definitely
the
case
but
it
looks
smells
and
feels
fantastic
overallits
just
the
prominence
and
balance
of
different
brett
notes
that
im
somewhat
at
odds
with
my
understanding
is
that
brian
wanted
to
create
a
very
clean
very
drinkable
brett
beer
and
using
brett
in
primary
with
the
malt
base
he
did
he
did
exactly
that
this
is
a
light
bodied
brew
with
a
modest
to
effervescent
level
of
carbonation
that
is
lightly
prickly
on
the
tongue
it
is
interestingly
enjoyable
at
times
but
it
does
have
some
distractions
that
make
the
brew
fall
apart
a
bit
as
the
experience
continues
the
blend
of
saison
character
and
tropical
hints
was
brilliant
the
sulfur
and
oily
lemon
not
so
much

from

into
a

nonic
poured
a
slightly
hazy
pale
golden
yellow
with
three
finger
pure
white
fluffy
head
that
subsided
to
one
finger
very
slowly
maintained
nice
lacing
throughout
the
glass
the
aroma
was
comprised
of
sweet
malt
earth
banana
fruit
spices
earthy
funk
and
horseblanket
the
flavor
was
of
sweet
malt
fruit
spices
earth
and
massive
funk
it
had
a
light
feel
on
the
palate
with
high
carbonation
overall
this
was
a
good
brew
the
brett
going
on
in
this
one
definitely
took
a
front
row
seat
in
both
the
aroma
and
especially
the
flavor
the
brett
plays
a
really
nice
role
in
this
style
as
it
can
stand
out
and
dominate
the
brew
the
aroma
is
quite
nice
on
it
as
well
an
absolute
must
try
if
you
have
not
done
so
already
you
wont
regret
it
at
all
i
suppose
for
the
style
the
appearance
does
not
get
much
better
its
yellow
but
it
has
nice
lacing
and
fair
head
retention
the
aroma
is
a
lot
of
lemon
lime
soda
phenols
band
aid
earth
and
funk
it
is
just
on
the
right
side
of
off
putting
honestly
strong
herbal
earthy
and
bitter
hop
flavors
a
well
hopped
beer
for
sure
the
lemon
lime
soda
appears
again
here
as
does
the
band
aid
and
phenol
but
it
is
more
subdued
and
mostly
in
the
finish
wonderfully
dry
and
crisp
i
would
love
this
on
a
hot
summer
day
a
neat
interpretation
of
a
bastard
style
in
the
beer
world
the
farm
smell
is
right
there
wafting
through
and
after
the
pour
really
funky
above
average
mouthfeel
nothing
exceptional
taste
wise
a
little
pepper
drinking
of
hay
but
drinkable
some
rice
as
in
saki
as
in
roast
and
toast
rice
worth
a
try
for
something
different
easy
to
get
through
a
bottle
but
not
worth
the
price
love
stillwater
sort
of
like
this
beer
o
this
is
a
pretty
tastier
beer
it
reminded
me
of
a
lighter
version
of
rayon
vert
the
brett
hits
you
like
a
ton
of
bricks
what
a
unique
base
for
such
a
heavy
brett
character
if
you
like
brett
seek
out
this
beer
nicely
done
pour
is
a
very
light
pale
yellow
light
haze
with
a
fair
amount
of
white
fluffy
head
nose
has
a
great
brett
presence
dusty
and
lightly
leathery
hints
of
peppery
spice
with
a
lemony
fruity
back
end
the
taste
is
great
strong
brett
presence
again
dusty
very
fruity
array
of
tropical
fruits
mangos
and
apricots
very
expressive
and
tight
soft
body
a
touch
syrupy
decent
carbonation
extremely
refreshing
and
so
bright
especially
for
the
abv
o
this
beer
really
has
a
beautiful
brett
character
that
is
full
in
the
aroma
with
some
nice
bright
flavors
supporting
it
in
the
taste
there
is
a
touch
of
tartness
that
grows
and
more
depth
comes
with
each
glass
bottle
not
a
bad
beer
for
a
style
im
not
a
huge
fan
of
poured
a
light
golden
yellow
pale
and
slightly
hazy
with
a
small
cap
of
white
bubbles
for
a
head
minimal
retention
and
lacing
aromas
of
pale
malts
musty
grass
and
a
distinctive
belgian
yeast
quality
that
puts
this
on
the
border
of
a
saison
typical
stillwater
fare
more
of
the
same
in
the
taste
bready
pale
malts
yeast
grass
light
herbal
hops
lightmedium
body
and
quite
good
for
the
style
not
much
a
fan
of
blonde
ales
but
the
brett
funks
this
thing
up
and
makes
it
a
beast
another
excellent
beer
in
the
long
line
of
belgianstyle
brews
from
stillwater
this
is
probably
the
lightest
and
most
drinkable
ive
had
from
them
even
if
its
not
quite
a
complex
and
meaty
as
some
of
the
other
one
of
the
easiest
most
flavorful
drinking
bretted
beers
i
have
had
to
date
you
can
have
a
few
of
these
and
really
enjoy
each
one
nice
the
flavoring
has
a
mild
tartness
to
it
and
a
light
spice
with
a
bitterness
midpoint
at
first
i
thought
of
a
rye
spiciness
with
its
concomitant
fruitlike
notes
turns
out
theres
a
double
addition
of
brett
which
would
explain
the
interesting
and
hardtoplace
flavors
and
aromas
as
well
as
the
exceptionally
dry
finish
and
what
i
can
only
describe
as
a
light
baking
soda
hint
on
the
flavor
crisp
light
delicious
ill
have
another
overall
this
beer
argued
too
much
with
my
sensibilities
the
result
i
could
not
appreciate
it
crisp
and
tasy
i
could
drink
this
beer
all
day
and
at
4
5
abv
probably
could
cheers
m
light
body
with
good
carbonation
light
flavors
and
good
use
of
adjuncts
and
brett
quick
fading
aftertaste
and
easy
to
drink
overall
an
interesting
and
fun
beer
to
drink
notes
sure
i
typically
like
what
this
brewer
is
doing
and
cant
help
but
to
reach
out
for
any
new
offering
but
this
one
hit
me
at
the
right
moment
on
the
right
spot
fantastic
so
much
flavor
with
the
low
above
and
that
range
really
nice
overall
a
very
good
brew
who
knew
brett
saison
yeast
and
hops
could
make
corn
and
rice
taste
good
growler
from
gbx
poured
into
a
weizen
glass
nice
amber
pour
with
a
ton
of
pillow
white
head
great
spoting
and
lacing
throughout
smell
is
of
zesty
fruits
complex
notes
of
citrus
and
some
wood
taste
is
a
great
mix
of
hops
malts
and
fruits
big
bold
taste
with
a
zesty
kick
on
the
end
that
leave
me
wanting
more
feel
is
lively
with
awesome
carbonation
and
some
dry
champagne
on
the
tongue
very
interesting
and
a
bonus
overall
a
very
quality
brew
from
stillwater
my
first
experience
with
this
outfit
and
im
impressed
a
very
enjoyable
blonde
that
had
so
much
going
on
with
the
taste
and
smell
sort
of
farmhouse
sort
of
saison
sort
of
good
will
hit
another
of
these
man
this
beer
is
tip
top
well
beyond
average
only
wish
i
was
a
baller
so
i
could
drink
it
all
the
time
at
15
a
750
milly
id
go
broke
otherwise
m
the
latesip
pairing
of
sweet
malts
belgian
spices
and
brettanomyces
is
a
game
changer
sweet
and
funky
and
lively
not
quite
a
fullon
saison
although
it
is
this
close
indicates
mere
millimeters
with
thumb
and
pointer
finger
the
ale
feels
heavy
though
perhaps
my
only
significant
complaint
poured
into
a
black
raven
imperial
pint
pours
a
slightly
cloudy
pale
yellow
amber
healthy
three
finger
head
and
active
carbonation
leaving
chunks
of
foam
on
the
side
of
the
glass
as
it
slowly
dissipated
looked
great
aromatic
aroma
of
belgian
yeast
and
spicing
light
fruit
and
citrus
slightly
sour
and
funky
flavor
dominated
by
citrus
mostly
lemon
and
brett
funk
light
grain
and
sweet
malt
astringently
bitter
finish
but
supported
by
the
fruit
from
the
citrus
im
not
a
big
fan
of
brett
but
i
have
to
admit
that
the
low
level
in
this
ale
along
with
the
refreshing
lemon
flavor
was
quite
nice
light
to
medium
bodied
not
my
style
but
i
enjoyed
the
whole
bottle
good
job
stillwater
overall
there
is
a
ton
of
flavor
in
this
beer
given
the
abv
i
thought
it
was
interesting
and
would
have
more
mouthfeel
is
kind
of
like
a
champagne
beer
bubbly
but
dry
dusty
and
tart
o
overall
a
pretty
nice
beer
from
saison
taste
had
a
little
too
much
pepper
for
me
but
the
nose
was
very
nice
would
try
it
again
beer
is
light
in
body
and
effervescent
a
little
dry
finish
pretty
bretty
brett
c
or
b
character
interesting
a
pretty
good
beer
id
have
it
again
the
beer
appears
a
hazy
straw
yellow
hue
with
a
lasting
white
head
the
aroma
is
enticing
offering
a
bouquet
of
floral
notes
citrus
earth
yeast
grass
the
flavor
has
all
of
the
aforementioned
characteristics
as
well
as
a
pleasant
spice
character
the
feel
is
smooth
on
the
palate
finishing
dry
with
a
crisp
hop
character
light
bodied
easy
to
drink
complex
delicious
i
would
happily
have
this
again
recommended
o
this
is
a
good
beer
that
is
easy
to
enjoy
brett
is
not
overpowering
i
feel
that
it
is
pilsner
with
brett
and
farmhouse
yeast
which
seems
to
work
well
in
my
opinion
pours
a
slightlyhazy
straw
color
with
a
really
nice
white
head
and
some
good
lacing
on
the
way
down
the
nose
brings
a
slight
bit
of
grain
along
with
some
faint
floral
hops
light
earthy
notes
as
well
the
flavor
has
a
nice
grainy
base
along
with
good
hop
and
yeast
notes
the
brett
shines
through
in
the
finish
which
is
quite
dry
light
crisp
body
really
nice
woah
definitely
a
mindfk
here
i
think
that
when
taken
in
context
this
is
one
very
very
well
done
beer
one
foot
in
outer
space
one
foot
in
hipster
dive
bar
pours
a
clear
gold
with
a
white
head
that
holds
and
leaves
lots
of
lace
nose
is
mainly
grain
corn
and
earthy
hops
touch
of
fruit
lemon
spicelemon
pepper
and
bread
thrown
in
for
good
measure
taste
is
crisp
dry
earthy
corny
and
eurohoppy
the
hops
seem
very
real
pilsner
like
just
a
tiny
touch
of
bitter
and
lots
of
earthy
goodness
extremely
clean
finish
with
no
aftertastes
brett
hasnt
quite
shown
itself
yet
so
i
am
curious
to
see
where
this
goes
created
as
deconstructed
hipster
schwill
i
find
it
to
really
hit
the
mark
light
with
flavors
of
adjunct
all
over
but
somehow
coming
off
elegant
and
premium
for
sure
not
what
i
expected
but
not
a
let
down
by
any
means
simple
clean
well
done
this
beer
poured
out
as
a
lightly
hazy
looking
yellow
color
the
head
was
white
and
a
little
on
the
fizzy
side
the
smell
of
the
beer
was
made
of
mostly
corn
aromas
and
bready
yeast
smells
very
much
like
a
very
generic
ale
the
taste
is
sweet
with
some
corn
and
grainy
flavors
the
mouthfeel
was
well
carbonated
with
a
decent
body
to
it
overall
this
beer
was
pretty
good
i
understand
the
style
that
was
being
attempted
here
and
i
think
its
pretty
good
i
found
this
beer
to
be
pretty
refreshing
actually
o
certainly
not
your
typical
blonde
ale
but
well
worth
trying
my
standby
lighter
craft
brew
with
light
session
beers
i
like
to
get
a
real
sense
of
the
ingredients
that
went
into
the
beer
this
seems
to
have
a
very
neutral
yeast
malt
and
hop
character
nothing
really
shines
not
a
poorly
brewed
beer
no
offflavors
i
just
have
had
much
more
interesting
blondes
where
you
really
get
a
sense
of
a
nice
base
malt
with
complimentary
hops
overall
a
good
summer
beer
that
has
more
favor
then
most
on
tap
at
matts
bar
in
south
minneapolis
and
its
wellmatched
to
heavy
fare
crisp
lightly
malty
thin
and
very
consumable
if
not
necessarily
inspired
overall
ive
had
this
on
tap
several
times
but
picked
up
an
onsale
sixer
for
a
review
this
is
a
good
starter
beer
for
your
bmc
drinkers
or
for
a
changeup
from
your
big
flavored
beers
worth
a
try
overall
a
good
example
of
the
blonde
ale
style
the
flavor
is
pleasant
and
interesting
but
stays
out
of
the
way
and
doesnt
try
to
make
a
bold
statement
i
would
have
preferred
the
malts
to
be
a
little
more
toasty
or
maybe
biscuity
rather
than
grainy
but
i
could
be
misperceiving
that
a
solid
member
of
the
fulton
lineup
that
should
not
be
overlooked
just
because
it
doesnt
have
an
overpowering
amount
of
hops
or
malt
mouth
was
ok
very
mild
even
for
a
crossover
beer
final
thoughts
i
went
into
this
review
having
never
tried
fulton
lonely
blonde
before
and
with
low
expectations
for
a
style
i
consider
boring
while
it
is
nothing
complex
or
mindblowing
lonely
blonde
doesnt
need
to
be
it
simply
impresses
with
its
good
flavor
and
drinkability
at
a
sessionable
abv
nice
one
especially
recommend
for
any
craft
beer
newbies
would
i
drink
it
again
yes
oi
am
not
a
huge
fan
of
american
blonde
ales
and
still
have
not
found
one
that
tastes
better
than
a
good
amber
lager
this
beer
doesnt
offer
anything
uniquei
would
not
purchase
again
and
would
think
twice
of
choosing
it
on
tap
at
a
bar
however
once
again
there
aint
nothing
wrong
with
it
and
it
is
just
as
good
as
a
blonde
ale
should
be
in
fact
its
nearly
perfect
for
a
blonde
ale
but
again
im
not
going
to
grab
at
one
anytime
soon
not
a
fan
of
this
one
why
pay
premium
price
for
what
could
be
replaced
by
a
pbr
or
high
life
my
first
sample
of
lonely
blonde
was
at
autumn
brew
review
in
2010
and
my
impression
was
far
less
favorable
my
guess
is
that
tough
festival
conditions
and
a
small
sample
of
a
more
delicate
beer
impaired
a
fair
tasting
fresh
and
from
the
brewery
its
a
solid
beer
thats
refreshing
with
a
complex
taste
that
explains
why
a
large
number
of
folks
are
drinking
with
a
lonely
blonde
at
the
tap
room
today
id
get
this
again
nice
summer
beer
or
with
lighter
foods
ofor
the
price
there
are
better
options
in
my
opinion
but
this
is
a
decent
brew
reminds
me
a
bit
of
spotted
cow
but
a
little
heavy
on
adjunct
flavor
golden
blonde
clear
with
a
white
foam
head
that
dissipates
quickl
leaving
a
skein
spotty
lace
here
and
there
smells
of
flaky
buttery
crackers
bread
dough
cereal
taste
is
cereal
grain
crackers
reminescent
of
triscuits
very
lightly
sweet
hop
bitterness
arrives
and
cleanses
the
palate
nicely
balances
and
a
clean
finish
body
is
medium
to
light
a
little
slick
holds
together
well
decent
carbonation
overall
light
but
decently
balanced
favors
make
for
easy
drinking
toast
and
butter
light
bitterness
in
the
aftertaste
simple
taste
slightly
grainy
papery
and
a
tad
swilly
light
bodied
with
light
carbonation
overall
drinkable
and
refreshing
enough
on
a
hot
day
though
id
prefer
my
local
version
half
acre
gossamer
to
this
o
this
is
a
beer
for
the
masses
to
enjoy
hot
day
hell
yes
id
put
this
back
nothing
special
but
its
solid
per
style
i
wasnt
going
to
drink
the
blonde
last
night
but
after
the
awful
sweet
child
o
vine
during
the
marquetteprovidence
game
i
was
like
trying
to
reset
the
palate
with
a
clean
beer
so
i
popped
this
blonde
ale
open
it
just
didnt
get
the
job
done
it
was
gritty
at
times
the
alcohol
seemed
bigger
than
it
should
have
it
just
didnt
leave
me
in
a
position
to
recommend
fulton
at
this
point
was
this
beer
built
to
compete
with
adjunct
lagers
it
certainly
seems
so
to
me
its
light
clean
and
crisp
without
a
ton
of
flavor
not
bad
but
there
are
better
beers
like
it
around
that
are
more
worth
drinking
yknow
certainly
not
a
bad
beer
but
kinda
boring
the
same
is
true
for
scov
squarely
a
b
beer
for
me
as
was
sweet
i
am
profulton
but
more
often
than
not
i
will
find
something
more
interesting
to
drink
i
think
fulton
needs
to
elevate
its
game
and
get
more
daring
o
this
was
an
okay
blonde
ale
id
like
to
try
some
more
beers
from
fulton
overall
a
pretty
solid
take
on
a
blonde
ale
tasty
and
very
easy
to
drink
overall
this
is
an
example
on
how
to
do
a
blonde
ale
correctly
and
its
perfect
for
any
occasion
its
not
complex
in
flavor
but
it
doesnt
need
to
be
it
gets
the
job
done
as
being
a
beer
that
doesnt
sacrifice
its
flavor
for
simplicity
this
one
really
does
nothing
for
me
i
hope
fulton
does
well
and
i
enjoyed
the
sweet
child
but
i
have
no
need
to
ever
try
this
one
again
overall
i
like
fultons
sweet
child
of
vine
that
ive
had
on
tap
on
a
few
occasions
and
will
try
that
one
from
the
bottle
next
i
was
hoping
for
more
from
this
beer
based
on
the
recent
hype
over
the
brewery
opening
in
town
and
bottles
being
available
this
isnt
a
very
good
interpretation
of
the
blonde
style
and
just
doesnt
do
much
for
me
i
wont
seek
it
out
again
but
im
hoping
they
try
some
more
adventurous
beers
in
the
future
i
might
suggest
this
beer
for
friends
or
family
who
usually
drink
light
beer
but
not
for
my
other
craft
beer
aficionado
friends
half
a
point
bonus
for
the
nice
labeling
on
the
bottle
decent
beer
but
isnt
much
better
than
a
bmc
beer
easy
drinking
but
lacking
depth
and
flavor
serving
type
bottle
o
a
simple
beer
and
one
that
is
easy
drinking
id
bring
this
one
to
a
tailgate
this
beer
pours
a
clear
pale
gold
color
the
head
is
half
an
inch
in
height
and
recedes
within
seconds
into
almost
no
lacing
the
aroma
is
of
light
bready
malt
with
a
hint
of
honey
it
is
nice
but
it
is
all
very
faint
even
for
the
style
the
taste
is
similar
to
the
aroma
i
like
what
i
am
tasting
but
it
is
just
to
light
even
for
a
blonde
ale
the
mouthfeel
is
on
the
lighter
side
of
medium
bodied
with
a
thin
texture
and
moderately
high
carbonation
overall
this
is
an
average
blonde
ale
that
i
will
probably
pass
of
next
time
o
a
good
summer
beer
with
a
low
abveasy
to
drink
but
flat
on
the
taste
still
an
allright
brew
to
try
drinkability
comes
across
as
a
creamier
fuller
bodied
hoppier
lager
and
that
is
aok
with
me
ontap
at
acadia
cafe
id
enjoyed
fultons
child
of
vine
and
hoped
this
would
prove
tasty
as
well
but
frankly
i
was
let
down
with
lonely
blonde
its
just
another
clean
grainy
blonde
ale
i
already
know
what
2row
barley
tastes
like
and
theres
nothing
new
here
plenty
of
other
breweries
have
made
this
same
beer
for
years
there
isnt
much
reason
to
single
this
one
out
i
will
try
again
to
reaffirm
my
impressions
i
know
that
the
first
time
i
had
sweet
child
of
vine
i
did
not
care
for
it
but
have
had
it
since
and
enjoyed
it
d
very
nice
summer
blond
refreshing
flavorful
enough
to
keep
me
interested
balanced
clean
very
nice
beer
from
the
new
kids
on
the
mpls
craft
beer
block
a
wonderful
medium
light
body
and
lots
of
hops

great
light
beer
from
a
brewery
known
for
their
chewy
ipaspas
and
amazing
sour
farmhouse
ales
this
might
be
the
best
tasting
4
abv
beer
ive
ever
tasted
i
enjoyed
it
outdoors
at
82
degrees
and
muggy
walden
was
perfect
in
these
conditions
verdict
a
wonderful
session
ale
im
hard
pressed
to
find
a
more
impactful
and
flavorful
example
of
the
style
refreshing
balanced
and
quaffable
everything
one
could
ask
for
yet
another
hill
farmstead
success
cheers
pour
is
a
pale
hazy
yellow
with
a
bubbly
white
head
nose
is
balanced
bready
and
light
dough
with
fresh
grain
notes
hops
are
soapy
and
citrusy
afterwards
taste
is
strongly
balanced
leaning
towards
the
grain
and
malt
bill
bread
fresh

balanced
hop
faint
soapy
balanced
citrus
hop
gentle
bitterness
carbonation
is
great
body
is
light
and
airy
with
a
semi
dry
finish
could
be
a
bit
brighter
but
darn
this
is
drinkable
and
balanced
wish
i
had
a
keg
every
saturday
to
day
drink
for
hours
pours
a
light
golden
yellow
color
with
nearly
a
finger
of
bright
head
great
lacing
and
retention
smells
of
light
lemony
grass
grain
mild
sweet
malts
and
dry
bitterness
tastes
essentially
the
same
dry
lemony
citrus
hops
mildly
grainy
mediumish
bodied
or
less
well
carbonated
awesome
feel
i
thought
this
would
be
my
least
favorite
in
the
tasting
room
it
was
my
second
favorite
behind
only
ss4
o
a
lot
of
sessionable
pales
have
been
popping
up
this
summer
which
is
definitely
ok
with
me
out
of
what
ive
had
song
of
spring
kane
ripple
and
carton
boat
this
is
probably
my
favorite
surely
the
smoothest
of
the
4
and
not
overly
bitter
like
boat
gets
after
a
while
the
only
problem
is
its
not
very
available
haha
classifying
this
beer
an
american
blonde
ale
may
be
a
bit
ridiculous
but
i
am
definitely
not
complaining
walden
truly
pushes
the
limits
of
the
style
i
cannot
remember
the
last
time
i
had
a
4
abv
beer
with
so
much
character
very
tasty
session
ale
but
i
prefer
the
hopping
in
nelson
more
opossibly
the
best
session
ale
out
there
great
balance
not
too
hoppy
but
at
the
same
enough
to
satisfy
hop
heads
oeasy
drinking
ale
nice
summer
beer
poured
ontap
into
a
shaker
pint
the
beer
is
a
cloudy
bright
opaque
lemonyellow
coloring
with
a
filmy
white
sparse
head
nose
of
lemon
grass
pine
resin
lemon
and
tangerine
and
a
subtle
bitterness
flavors
of
tangy
sweet
citrus
lemoncentric
with
a
grainy
undertone
bitter
tailend
very
light
and
crisp
the
aftertaste
is
citrus
and
hoppy
with
a
semisweet
crisp
finish
extremely
drinkable
wishing
the
flavors
matched
the
nose
a
bit
more
and
with
all
the
palate
wrecking
hfs
varieties
ive
sampled
recently
this
one
falls
a
bit
short
yet
not
unexpected
from
the
abv
and
sessionability
angle
worth
trying
overall
and
an
enjoyable
blonde
ale
overall
an
extremely
delicious
session
ale
i
could
drink
this
all
day
and
that
would
be
a
terrific
day
because
this
little
beer
has
a
ton
of
flavor
and
its
extremely
delicious
the
hop
combination
creates
a
wonderful
flavor
profile
a
delicious
hop
juice
feels
very
delicate
but
brings
a
ton
of
hop
flavor
to
the
table
without
a
substantial
bitterness
a
session
beer
indeed
overall
a
tremendous
summer
beer
that
at
4
25abv
is
one
that
could
be
drank
all
day
it
is
palate
cleansing
and
refreshing
and
though
it
is
different
from
what
i
would
expect
from
these
two
brewers
but
the
quality
is
exactly
what
youd
expect
this
is
perhaps
the
best
session
beer
on
mother
earth
it
pours
a
curiously
greener
tinted
hazy
dull
golden
color
not
green
exactly
but
hued
on
that
side
of
yellow
i
have
seen
this
before
my
globe
was
a
little
overfilled
at
the
farmhouse
tap
in
burlington
so
there
wasnt
much
room
for
head
but
i
am
certainly
not
complaining
about
a
generous
pour
great
nose
a
hop
variety
that
is
new
to
my
senses
here
its
fruity
and
a
little
tart
like
some
of
the
new
zealand
strains
but
this
has
some
bitter
and
high
alpha
simcoe
action
too
a
great
blend
of
hops
here
in
smell
and
taste
the
taste
is
intensely
hoppy
more
like
an
ipa
than
anything
else
but
the
beer
is
gone
as
soon
as
i
taste
it
like
the
driest
finish
ever
so
dry
in
fact
that
it
doesnt
have
a
finish
its
more
like
a
dry
middle
love
the
quick
hits
of
hops
lots
of
punctuation
here
staggered
but
dynamic
splendid
really
im
totally
digging
this
i
taste
just
the
slightest
hint
of
bretty
funk
in
the
finish
not
saison
yeast
but
brett
new
like
this
might
get
crazy
in
a
few
more
months
maybe
its
me
maybe
not
but
whatever
the
yeast
is
here
its
got
plenty
of
character
its
like
something
mikkeller
could
have
come
up
with
but
more
refined
than
that
way
more
refined
carbonated
like
champagne
lighter
than
air
robustly
hopped
drinkable
as
anything
this
is
basically
a
perfect
specimen
and
i
envy
the
vermont
locals
who
drink
this
stuff
regularly
what
a
special
treat
oh
it
also
instantaneously
stopped
an
allergic
reaction
i
was
having
so
there
is
some
magic
in
the
glass
as
well
this
was
a
semihazy
golden
yellow
beer
definite
wheat
malt
head
small
glass
but
very
fluffy
the
body
of
this
beer
was
very
light
i
dont
know
if
it
was
the
yeast
that
was
in
suspension
or
the
wheat
used
in
the
malt
but
the
grassy
quality
of
this
beer
really
surprised
me
not
citrusy
at
all
but
definitely
grassy
i
was
also
a
bit
surprised
at
the
lingering
bitterness
on
the
tongue
not
sure
if
it
was
from
hops
or
perhaps
a
slightly
funky
yeast
but
it
was
very
good
pours
a
light
hazed
yellow
with
a
dense
white
head
leaves
plenty
of
lace
and
thing
ring
as
the
head
fades
crisp
bready

and
lemoncitrus
hop
aroma
nicely
balanced
light
bodied
well
carbonated
with
a
dry
grassy
and
citrus
bitter
hop
finish
flavor
has
a
strong
bready
malt
base
and
tons
of
lemon
and
grass
with
mild
grapefruit
juiciness
amazing
for
a
blonde
overall
good
very
nice
or
a
blonde
ale
light
in
body
but
still
has
a
good
hop
bite
to
it
impressive
as
always
thanks
to
yourefragile
for
sharing
the
growler
served
in
hill
farmstead
stemware
pours
a
very
pale
straw
color
with
a
really
nice
white
head
and
plenty
of
lacing
nose
has
nice
lemon
and
a
touch
of
citrus
intense
flavor
more
subdued
light
grain
fairly
bitter
and
quite
dry
really
drinkable
palate
light
bodied
without
ever
approaching
thin
creamy
biscuity
with
huge
citrus
flavors
primarily
orange
flesh
and
rind
with
lemon
and
a
touch
of
grapefruit
clean
floral
finish
with
mild
bitterness
this
is
beautifully
crafted
and
highly
quaffable
outstanding
o
this
is
fantastic
it
is
easy
to
appreciate
in
small
bursts
makes
for
great
sipping
and
can
also
be
consumed
in
mass
quantities
i
wish
there
were
local
options
like
this
it
would
be
an
ideal
kegerator
beer
medium
medium
light
in
body
fantastically
balanced
apa
id
trade
some
green
beans
for
it
overall
a
really
flavorful
and
interesting
sessionable
version
of
an
ipa
im
almost
done
the
growler
and
i
can
barely
feel
any
effects
it
really
succeeds
in
that
regard
it
is
a
bit
watery
in
the
finish
but
i
feel
that
is
a
byproduct
of
the
powerful
hop
flavors
upfront
that
just
cannot
be
sustained
throughout
really
good
and
interesting
but
i
would
not
say
it
is
my
favorite
from
hf
perfect
for
a
sessionable
hoppy
beer
though
this
is
awesome
all
this
at
4
yes
please
i
had
this
with
life
wo
principle
1
and
while
that
is
really
good
this
is
just
a
bit
better
with
the
low
abv
really
hammering
it
home
this
is
the
definition
of
a
sessionable
beer
the
palate
opens
hoppy
mildly
grassy
but
mostly
citrusy
a
nice
doughy
malt
character
is
present
midpalate
fruity
citrus
peach
fleshy
grapefruit
this
is
an
excellent
showcase
of
hops
not
particularly
bitter
this
is
drying
on
the
finish
with
a
fruity
bitterness
and
a
mild
grapefruit
pithlike
bitterness
very
nice
stuff
this
is
extremely
sessionable
pours
a
hazy
light
yellow
with
a
medium
white
head
smell
is
a
really
nice
citrusy
hop
with
bready
malt
in
the
background
not
quite
as
nice
of
an
aroma
as
lwp
but
still
rather
impressive
i
think
it
might
get
a
4
5
if
i
wasnt
comparing
the
two
flavor
however
is
more
impressive
than
lwp
its
a
little
bigger
and
maltier
than
lwp
but
with
a
similar
hop
profile
it
almost
comes
off
like
a
baby
version
of
heady
topper
mouthfeel
is
lightmedium
bodied
with
nice
carbonation
overall
this
is
another
great
hoppy
beer
from
hf
and
one
i
prefer
slightly
to
lwp
the
beer
is
light
golden
yellow
with
a
soft
white
head
the
aroma
is
great
offering
some
citrus
and
tropical
fruits
the
flavor
brings
a
light
biscuit
malty
character
that
gracefully
balances
the
beer
still
a
hop
forward
offering
of
course
lingering
hop
bitterness
and
tropical
citrus
on
the
palate
delicious
i
could
drink
a
lot
of
this
this
beer
also
has
a
nice
golden
look
though
this
one
is
notably
hazier
than
the
previous
beer
life
wo
principle
and
has
tons
of
lacing
ith
a
small
ring
of
white
head
the
smell
is
great
and
again
reminds
me
of
a
hoppy
citrus
pale
ale
with
a
light
honey
malt
backbone
to
it
the
taste
has
a
big
malt
backbone
with
some
grassy
hop
notes
and
a
touch
of
citrus
lemon
grass
that
reminds
me
of
gumball
head
though
not
as
aggressive
the
feel
is
nice
and
light
ok
carbonation
another
nice
beer
overall
somewhat
interesting
but
not
driving
me
that
much
for
what
is
offered
but
certainly
plenty
to
enjoy
o
this
one
tastes
like
some
of
the
other
hf
pale
ales
even
tho
it
is
a
blonde
ale
the
hops
and
base
blonde
work
very
well
together
combining
with
the
low
abv
to
make
this
one
very
easy
to
consume
this
is
a
really
awesome
beer
another
winner
from
hf
obv
one
of
the
tastiest
lightest
and
wonderful
blondes
ive
had
i
would
drink
this
beer
so
often
if
it
was
around
me
hard
to
get
tired
of
it
even
though
its
so
light
o
this
was
definitely
the
best
blonde
ale
ive
ever
had
if
you
can
call
it
that
almost
more
like
a
citrusy
ipa
then
anything
still
finishes
with
a
blonde
ale
feel
extremely
sessionable
and
lots
of
flavor
for
such
a
low
abv
beer
i
definitely
recommend
trying
this
out
if
you
can
i
would
drink
this
every
day
if
i
could
2l
growler
pale
hazy
yellow
decent
head
that
recedes
quickly
aroma
of
oranges
citrus
peel
resinous
hops
and
white
flowers
very
aromatic
high
lemon
tartness
blends
wonderfully
with
leafy
hops
and
citruz
zest
bitterness
light
bodied
and
dry
finish
makes
it
highly
drinkable
i
really
like
the
actual
summer
beer
trend
it
reminds
me
of
ddc
wallonade
or
tdd
traction
ale
with
hill
farmstead
quality
standards
this
is
a
great
preamble
to
the
very
promising
low
abv
high
citrus
series
ogreat
session
beer
this
is
a
light
bodied
brew
with
a
modest
amount
of
carbonation
at
times
it
is
fairly
watery
but
considering
it
is
4
i
cant
complain
this
is
quite
a
summertime
offering
that
i
could
throw
a
growler
full
back
easily
by
myself
without
regret
my
only
real
cause
for
concern
here
is
that
in
the
past
2
months
i
have
now
tried
5
different
hoppy
beers
by
hill
farmstead
that
are
new
to
me
each
and
every
one
of
them
despite
being
an
ipa
dipa
pale
ale
or
hoppy
blonde
all
have
a
dominating
straw
character
to
them
that
stands
out
more
than
i
would
expect
i
guess
thats
just
hfs
house
character
i
recently
got
to
try
2
other
brewers
takes
on
using
the
motueka
hop
and
despite
knowing
that
was
in
this
brew
it
just
doesnt
come
out
to
me
nor
does
the
amarillo
d
absolutely
crushable
stuff
could
have
drank
all
750ml
easily
on
my
own
or
perhaps
even
an
entire
2l
growler
shaun
has
certainly
redefined
the
blonde
ale
with
this
beer
beer
is
light
in
body
hoppy
on
the
palate
but
not
bitter
at
the
end
it
is
mildly
grainy
and
the
aroma
turns
out
to
be
the
best
part
it
has
a
nice
feel
to
it
and
i
would
have
it
again
mouthfeel
is
light
and
plenty
refreshing
making
this
one
incredibly
drinkable
overall
as
expected
hf
and
the
alchemist
worked
their
magic
with
an
incredibly
tasty
session
blonde
with
so
many
hit
or
miss
collaborations
out
there
this
one
was
certainly
a
hit
this
isnt
the
hop
bomb
one
might
expect
from
these
breweries
but
it
is
certainly
hoppy
with
nice
bitterness
i
guess
for
these
guys
it
counts
as
balanced
yum
the
body
is
nice
and
light
with
good
carbonation
overall
this
one
is
pretty
amazing
lots
of
flavor
for
a
tiny
beer
m
light
body
moderate
carbonation
overall
this
is
what
a
blond
should
be
not
any
of
that
light
malts
and
hint
of
hops
this
is
a
blend
of
lots
of
tropical
fruits
lighter
malts
with
a
full
taste
profile
and
soft
feel
and
ridiculously
drinkable
i
could
pound
the
entire
750ml
growler
in
a
few
minutes
if
im
not
careful
i
dont
think
you
can
do
a
blond
better
probably
pinnacle
of
the
style
odmy
two
favorite
breweries
absolutely
killed
this
collaboration
has
the
flavor
of
a
toptier
dipa
yet
it
has
the
feel
of
a
blonde
ale
this
is
why
craft
beer
is
my
biggest
hobby
i
could
drink
this
and
only
this
every
day
and
be
completely
satisfied
the
perfect
mixture
of
sessionability
and
hoppiness
if
this
can
stand
up
to
the
best
dipas
and
ipas
i
have
tried
it
deserves
a
huge
rating
o
overall
this
is
a
superb
beer
once
again
from
hill
farmstead
the
aromas
and
flavors
on
this
are
a
home
run
i
wish
more
brewers
created
beers
like
this
or
atleast
it
wasnt
a
5
hour
drive
to
get
some
hf
i
am
not
a
fan
of
coffee
flavor
it
tastes
like
a
mocha
drink
most
who
are
into
that
style
of
flavor
would
probably
love
it
though
its
just
not
my
thing
poured
from
bottle
to
pint
glass
pale
pale
yellow
with
a
little
head
no
lacing
smells
of
coffee
and
cream
slight
bitterness
roasted
sweet
caramel
taste
follows
sweet
coffee
with
a
tiny
bite
on
the
end
mouthfeel
is
thin
could
be
a
perception
thing
since
i
was
expecting
something
thicker
to
go
along
with
the
coffee
flavor
little
to
no
aftertaste
just
an
odd
flavor
combination
for
me
blonde
ale
and
coffee
blah
what
i
imagine
a
coffee
enema
tastes
like
the
coffee
aroma
is
divine
smell
of
delicious
coffee
and
vanilla
taste
is
a
bit
messy
pretty
solid
for
a
coffee
blonde
though
odd
side
coffee
taste
ok
but
not
a
repeat
artificially
flavored
coffee
and
caramel
added
to
water
nice
attempt
but
lets
be
real
there
is
no
complexity
to
this
beer
coffee
forward
on
a
lightbodied
blonde
i
was
made
to
try
this
with
my
eyes
closed
and
guess
the
color
yep
got
it
wrong
love
the
light
coffee
flavor
and
crispness
of
the
blonde
my
palate
isnt
so
sophisticated
but
this
tastes
deliciously
delicate
im
not
sure
but
i
enjoy
this
beer
lots
of
vanilla
flavor
some
coffee
and
a
little
chocolate
as
someone
else
said
little
carbonation
which
is
ok
with
me
smooth
and
drinkable
but
probably
not
a
regular
go
to
beer
for
me
given
the
intensity
of
the
vanilla
flavor
but
a
refreshing
change
of
pace
tastes
like
cream
soda
with
a
coffee
aftertaste
neccos
chocolate
candies
is
all
i
can
taste
its
chalky
its
coffee
chocolate
its
an
aleish
thing
the
body
was
medium
to
light
with
modest
carbonation
o
one
word
unique
flavors
make
this
interesting
billed
as
a
blonde
ale
with
coffee
its
a
misleading
label
this
is
a
blond
ale
hidden
within
a
mocha
tone
down
the
chocolates
turn
up
the
coffee
but
not
too
much
letting
the
blonde
come
through
this
might
be
a
really
interesting
beer
i
really
enjoy
the
longboarder
porter
made
with
coffee
and
this
is
the
blond
ale
version
it
is
fantastic
and
they
have
mastered
the
coffee
flavor
but
without
compromising
the
taste
of
the
beer
because
of
the
smell
and
mouthful
was
more
like
that
of
a
cream
ale
instead
of
a
blond
ale
i
rated
it
a
bit
low
this
doesnt
take
away
the
fact
that
the
texture
of
the
flavor
is
superb
very
interesting
and
a
delightful
surprisingly
good
beer
i
wasnt
sure
what
to
expect
but
decided
to
try
it
because
it
wasnt
like
anything
i
had
tried
before
i
could
taste
some
vanilla
and
the
coffee
flavor
is
detectable
but
not
at
all
overpowering
overall
weird
beer
as
per
the
brewery
this
is
certainly
odd
and
different
than
anything
else
ive
ever
had
i
dont
think
ive
even
had
a
blonde
with
coffee
added
before
period
otherwise
forgettable
i
would
drink
this
often
if
i
could
for
sure
i
was
perplexed
when
i
saw
a
coffee
infused
blonde
ale
but
at
the
same
time
exhilarated
to
try
it
damn
glad
i
did
this
ale
pours
a
golden
hue
with
little
white
head
and
virtually
no
lacing
the
nose
reminds
me
of
hot
chocolate
not
a
lot
of
coffee
notes
just
a
subtle
sweet
chocolaty
smell
theres
a
lot
of
malt
here
as
well
and
a
bit
of
hops
to
round
it
out
this
offering
sips
very
light
and
smooth
the
flavor
is
much
more
complex
than
i
had
ever
expected
it
is
sweet
and
reminiscent
of
iced
mocha
at
first
but
followed
by
a
nice
hoppy
bitterness
all
to
resolve
with
a
sweet
malty
chocolate
finish
this
is
a
delicious
and
surprisingly
complex
beer
nothing
like
what
i
expected
but
very
refreshing
and
enjoyable
would
gladly
buy
this
one
again
i
assumed
something
so
dark
roasty
and
powerful
as
coffee
would
overwhelm
a
style
that
is
clean
neutral
and
light
but
i
was
amazingly
wrong
whod
have
thought
that
a
pale
easydrinking
and
approachable
beer
could
retain
those
qualities
amongst
such
an
appreciable
coffee
presence
oddside
ales
you
are
indeed
very
odd
but
also
clever
and
talented
o
this
is
an
interesting
beer
that
i
will
more
than
likely
revisit
i
like
the
coffee
flavor
in
a
lighter
beer
i
think
this
would
be
a
great
alternative
to
a
coffee
stout
in
the
summer
when
i
am
craving
the
coffee
flavor
but
want
a
light
bodied
beer
pours
a
clear
yelloworange
with
a
foamy
bone
head
that
settles
to
wisps
of
film
on
top
of
the
beer
small
dots
of
lace
slowly
drip
into
the
remaining
beer
on
the
drink
down
smell
is
of
malt
grain
earth
and
slight
coffee
aromas
taste
is
much
the
same
with
vanilla
and
coffee
flavors
on
the
finish
there
is
a
mild
amount
of
roast
bitterness
on
the
palate
with
each
sip
this
beer
has
a
lower
level
of
carbonation
with
a
slightly
crisp
mouthfeel
overall
this
is
an
above
average
beer
that
is
drinkable
but
the
coffee
aspect
doesnt
really
work
all
that
well
with
the
base
beer
in
my
opinion
o
it
was
worth
trying
and
an
interesting
attempt
at
a
unique
beer
somehow
the
flavors
do
not
mesh
right
and
leaves
the
beer
without
any
great
qualities
perhaps
the
recipe
can
be
tweaked
to
make
it
blend
better
o
great
beer
unique
aroma
im
getting
very
difficult
to
describe
no
astringency
amazing
coffee
weird
vegetal
flavor
green
coffee
beans
definitely
a
must
try
even
if
you
dont
like
coffee
and
the
usual
espresso
stouts
an
interesting
take
on
a
typical
blonde
ale
with
an
unmistakable
coffee
other
than
that
this
is
your
typical
unproposessing
blonde
with
guzzledown
drinkabilty
traded
off
for
any
sort
of
body
this
is
photoshopped
supermodelthin
still
i
enjoyed
it
an
above
average
and
unique
blonde
ale
that
may
not
be
saying
a
ton
but
one
of
the
better
blondes
out
there
o
is
it
a
lager
is
it
a
stout
what
is
this
concoction
i
applaud
the
brewer
for
creativity
but
the
lack
of
identity
makes
this
more
of
a
novelty
id
try
it
again
but
i
will
not
seek
it
out
good
mouthfeel
and
easy
drinking
this
would
make
for
an
excellent
breakfast
beer
for
those
folks
in
odd
sides
distro
area
4
5
abv
you
got
the
right
idea
bean
flicker
is
another
interesting
beer
from
odd
sides
i
cant
say
im
a
huge
fan
but
the
concept
is
fun
and
unique
and
certainly
worth
a
try
the
nose
and
flavor
are
both
comforting
until
i
get
those
strange
notes
of
rubber
if
the
rubber
wasnt
present
this
would
be
a
much
better
beer
not
sure
if
its
the
influence
of
the
nights
prior
selection
but
this
brew
seems
extremely
chocolatey
rather
than
coffee
dominant
which
suits
my
palate
well
the
base
beer
is
an
afterthought
if
it
werent
for
the
off
flavorsdue
to
the
base
beer
this
would
really
do
well
this
is
an
interesting
brew
it
goes
down
nicer
than
i
thought
but
the
flavor
is
mostly
artificial
despite
it
its
well
balanced
and
easy
to
drink
i
would
buy
it
again
o
goes
to
show
flavor
doesnt
always
follow
appearance
i
thought
it
would
be
a
mess
but
i
quite
enjoyed
it
this
stuff
reminds
me
of
that
purple
and
green
ketchup
that
heinz
put
out
many
years
ago
it
smells
and
tastes
as
its
labeled
but
it
looks
completely
mismatched
and
causes
a
mild
mind
bending
when
you
make
the
transfer
from
sight
to
smell
to
taste
i
actually
enjoyed
bean
flicker
more
than
i
had
anticipated
it
was
quite
tasty
really
though
the
optical
illusion
aspect
is
something
my
tickled
brain
couldnt
overcome
completely

overall
this
is
an
outstanding
coffee
blonde
ale
great
robustness
of
authentic
coffeecream
flavor
and
extremely
smooth
and
crisp
to
drink
a
highly
enjoyable
offering
an
interesting
use
of
coffee
with
a
nice
light
body
could
be
a
highly
quaffable
beer
but
it
falls
apart
as
it
warms
and
it
feels
a
bit
mismatched
carbonation
doesnt
help
either
this
is
interesting
not
something
i
would
want
many
of
in
a
row
but
here
and
there
it
is
good
overall
i
have
had
this
beer
several
times
now
twice
on
tap
and
have
purchase
three
six
packs
of
it
this
is
my
favorite
sessionable
beer
at
only
4
5
abv
i
could
drink
this
beer
all
day
if
it
proves
to
be
available
year
round
i
have
a
new
go
to
beer
i
hate
blonde
ales
because
they
usually
lack
flavor
and
complexity
but
this
one
has
me
wanting
to
revisit
the
style
love
odd
sides
brews
highly
recommend
this
beer
tastefeel
here
we
go
again
odd
side
impresses
me
again
really
liking
how
this
drinks
its
about
what
i
expected
its
a
blonde
ale
with
coffee
in
it
what
do
you
want
me
to
say
the
flavor
of
this
is
actually
a
bit
more
than
i
thought
to
expect
but
thats
fine
by
me
if
thats
not
enough
theres
a
solid
feel
to
this
as
well
the
coffee
flavor
manages
to
stick
to
your
tongue
for
awhile
after
you
sip
which
i
enjoy
a
lot
ya
dont
need
a
dark
beer
to
get
a
coffee
fix
in
your
beer
and
this
blonde
ale
proves
that
a
4
5
beer
with
a
nice
body
surprisingly
bold
flavor
count
me
in
odd
side
just
doesnt
disappoint
worth
the
slight
upcharge
overall
i
really
like
this
beer
and
will
drink
many
with
my
wife
it
is
nice
to
have
something
we
both
enjoy
it
is
an
interesting
take
on
a
blonde
ale
different
from
anything
i
have
had
i
love
coffee
stouts
but
this
is
the
first
light
style
i
have
had
i
recommend
this
for
every
one
looking
for
something
session
able
flavorful
and
different
overall
i
really
liked
this
beer
and
i
thought
it
was
a
great
example
of
a
coffee
infused
beer
that
didnt
have
a
dark
beer
base
it
showed
me
that
while
the
dark
beer
base
can
meld
well
with
the
coffee
flavors
it
isnt
always
a
necessary
and
that
coffee
has
the
potential
to
work
with
the
other
styles
that
i
never
would
have
thought
would
have
turned
out
to
be
good
this
beer
has
very
good
drinkability
its
smooth
crisp
not
filling
and
the
flavors
did
a
good
job
of
holding
my
attention
and
keeping
me
coming
back
for
more
it
wouldnt
be
a
stretch
from
me
to
drink
more
than
a
few
bottles
of
this
since
that
taste
really
doesnt
wear
on
me
what
i
like
the
most
about
this
beer
was
just
about
everything
all
aspects
of
this
beer
were
right
where
they
needed
to
be
to
live
up
to
its
name
what
i
liked
the
least
about
this
beer
was
nothing
there
wasnt
a
single
thing
that
i
didnt
like
or
would
change
about
this
beer
its
great
just
the
way
it
is
i
would
for
sure
buy
this
beer
again
in
fact
i
already
went
back
and
got
a
six
pack
and
i
see
a
few
more
in
my
future
and
it
just
my
be
a
new
regular
in
my
beer
fridge
i
would
recommend
this
to
anyone
who
likes
coffee
infused
beer
all
in
all
i
was
pretty
impressed
with
this
beer
i
have
been
pretty
impressed
with
oddsides
but
i
wasnt
sure
that
they
could
pull
of
a
coffee
blonde
ale
but
they
did
it
in
a
way
that
truly
impressed
me
it
really
messed
with
my
head
at
first
because
it
looks
exactly
like
a
normal
blonde
ale
but
the
taste
is
anything
but
normal
great
job
oddsides
you
guys
are
making
some
great
beer
and
i
have
no
problem
claiming
that
their
one
of
my
favorite
up
in
coming
brewerys
keep
up
the
great
work
guys
overall
i
was
hesitant
to
buy
this
one
and
only
bought
a
single
rather
that
a
sixer
i
was
very
pleasantly
surprised
nice
light
coffee
taste
easy
the
most
memorable
and
best
blonde
that
i
can
think
of
the
feel
has
too
much
spritz
at
first
though
that
drops
after
time
while
appropriately
lightbodied
it
tends
toward
a
watery
feel
in
the
middle
with
nothing
to
really
make
up
for
the
loss
a
smoothness
seems
to
attempt
to
develop
but
doesnt
really
a
minerality
comes
out
at
the
end
of
each
sip
overall
what
we
enjoyed
most
about
this
beer
was
its
aroma
here
we
get
an
instantly
curious
juxtaposition
of
a
clean
blonde
ale
base
with
nicely
bittered
grain
while
atop
it
we
ride
alongside
stronger
coffee
flavoring
than
weve
experienced
in
some
straight
coffee
stouts
the
case
is
very
much
the
same
through
the
flavoring
with
the
first
and
last
thing
youre
left
thinking
about
is
this
bright
hazelnut
coffee
roastiness
its
quite
the
odd
pair
no
pun
intended
that
said
it
seems
as
if
theyve
accomplished
what
they
set
out
to
do
with
this
one
and
we
are
happy
to
have
been
a
part
of
the
experiment
one
downside
was
the
carbonation
which
approached
the
level
of
champagne
slowing
drinkability
a
bit
this
beer
will
certainly
not
appeal
to
everyone
but
if
youve
got
the
interest
it
is
certainly
worth
your
time
rated
this
as
a
blonde
ale
not
an
extra
pale
ale
as
abw
classifies
it
as
not
bad
pretty
average
simultaneously
sweet
and
grainy
the
beer
shares
the
qualities
of
a
failed
experiment
and
a
cheap
macrolager
i
like
abw
a
lot
and
thats
why
this
ones
a
headscratcher
its
direct
competition
in
town
in
the
easydrinking
ale
category
hops
and
grains
the
one
they
call
zoe
blows
it
out
of
the
water
cant
all
be
gems
i
guess
thanks
duff247
for
the
opportunity
pretty
disappointed
in
this
beer
it
seems
that
they
are
trying
to
make
a
mass
market
lager
with
a
craft
beer
price
tag
this
is
my
1st
beer
from
austin
beerworks
after
hearing
good
things
about
the
brewery
it
taste
like
a
subpar
lager
such
as
lone
star
or
pbr
after
drinking
a
few
dogfish
60
minute
ipas
i
grabbed
a
6
pack
of
this
stuff
for
10
and
couldnt
even
taste
it
i
hope
the
breweries
other
beers
have
better
character
than
this
one
otherwise
i
wont
be
revisiting
no
characteristics
to
point
out
just
terrible
o
this
was
a
decent
pale
ale
that
was
nice
to
drink
there
wasnt
anything
that
really
stood
out
in
it
but
it
was
overall
enjoyable
im
glad
i
got
to
try
it
thanks
again
sam
for
sending
it
cheers
o
this
beer
is
pretty
average
the
flavors
are
ok
the
mouthfeel
is
ok
its
just
ok
i
didnt
hate
it
and
i
didnt
love
it
this
would
be
a
great
alternative
to
bmc
if
you
wanted
a
substitute
i
could
see
finishing
quite
a
few
of
these
in
the
summertime
which
should
be
starting
in
about
three
days
drink
i
wanted
this
one
for
the
style
tick
i
wouldnt
have
searched
it
out
in
the
meantime
i
can
say
that
on
a
sweltering
hot
texas
or
ca
summer
day
this
would
work
wonders
austin
beerworks
needs
to
reconfigure
this
ale
or
just
get
rid
of
it
all
together
d
overall
underwhelming
good
yes
i
finished
it
but
not
great
or
worth
revisiting
this
is
what
would
be
an
extra
pale
ale
in
terms
of
being
extra
pale
rather
than
extraordinary
o
this
beer
is
ok
that
is
about
all
ive
got
for
once
i
would
not
buy
it
under
any
circumstance
unless
there
was
just
a
bunch
of
crappy
major
brands
and
this
brew
one
last
thing
the
name
peacemaker
given
the
history
of
the
texas
rangers
and
whatnot
i
imagine
that
this
is
a
reference
to
the
guns
they
used
in
as
pacifiers
while
this
may
be
clever
and
in
line
with
the
brewerys
theme
speaking
for
myself
it
brings
up
uncomfortable
connotations
that
really
shouldnt
affect
my
experience
drinking
but
they
do
and
it
does
not
bad
nothing
spectacular
though
overall
this
is
an
ok
beer
nothing
stands
out
but
its
not
bad
either
i
had
it
as
a
beer
to
end
the
night
with
and
it
might
be
best
served
in
that
role
a
pretty
basic
take
on
the
style
nothing
spectacular
but
perfectly
drinkable
creamy
body
with
grainy
nuts
on
the
flavor
packs
a
nice
amount
of
flavor
in
here
with
a
nice
kiss
of
grassy
and
floral
hops
on
the
finish
kind
of
like
a
cream
ale
with
a
bit
more
malt
flavor
and
maybe
more
yeast
character
i
like
this
one
the
earthiness
from
the
malt
and
understated
hop
presence
give
this
one
a
british
feel
to
it
i
still
like
the
pearl
snap
pils
a
little
better
than
this
as
far
as
abw
offerings
are
concerned
but
the
peacemaker
ranks
above
the
ipa
for
me
tasty
brew
ill
buy
another
sixer
of
this
one
no
doubt
this
drinks
like
a
refreshing
blonde
almost
kolschlike
easy
going
with
only
a
modest
bitterness
and
a
pleasant
crackerbread
malt
profile
would
enjoy
another
o
light
and
very
mild
ok
the
beer
pours
a
clear
yellow
color
with
a
white
head
the
aroma
is
full
of
grass
and
orange
citrus
hops
with
a
little
bit
of
bread
and
biscuit
malt
the
flavor
is
more
of
the
same
with
some
juicy
orange
citrus
notes
coming
from
the
hops
the
bitterness
is
fairly
low
and
the
beer
is
well
balanced
medium
mouthfeel
and
medium
carbonation
a
very
nice
beer
overall
simple
and
enjoyable
i
like
it
not
the
big
hits
like
fire
eagle
or
pearl
snap
are
but
still
a
well
made
mild
pale
ale
excellent
for
the
summer
or
just
everyday
drinking
either
i
just
pick
up
xpas
that
are
past
their
prime
or
this
one
is
just
somewhat
exceptional
mouthfeel
crisp
and
snappy
o
not
bad
but
not
quite
as
nice
as
the
pils
or
the
ipa
the
mouthfeels
just
right
and
id
drink
this
again
i
would
definitely
take
this
beer
with
me
to
tubing
trips
its
such
an
easygoing
beer
however
out
of
three
beers
i
have
tried
from
austin
beerworks
i
think
i
enjoyed
pearl
snap
the
most
12
oz
can
poured
into
sam
adams
glass
pale
amber
color
with
pretty
much
no
head
or
lacing
looks
a
lot
like
apple
cider
not
a
flavorful
aroma
kind
of
a
sour
papery
malt
smell
weak
hop
flavors
for
a
pale
ale
seems
like
more
of
a
blonde
ale
pretty
bland
overall
finishes
okay
good
carbonation
and
bitter
bite
overall
its
a
step
above
domestic
lagers
but
needs
some
work
o
prefer
their
ipa
but
i
could
see
myself
drinking
a
lot
of
this
over
the
summer
clear
yellow
no
head
or
lace
head
could
not
be
created
on
swirling
malty
aroma
taste
is
predominantly
malt
but
very
clean
the
look
and
mouthfeel
are
similar
to
an
adjunct
lager
but
the
taste
is
much
cleaner
in
that
it
is
devoid
of
the
earthy
corn
flavors
in
the
finish
high
carbonation
and
mediumlight
body
a
good
summer
time
beer
overall
very
easy
to
drink
took
my
time
with
the
first
can
but
the
second
one
i
took
down
in
about
5
gulps
great
to
see
new
offering
in
texas
and
great
to
see
more
offerings
out
of
the
can
i
will
have
to
give
their
other
varieties
a
try
i
hate
for
this
beer
to
have
a
negative
first
review
but
i
am
being
honest
hopefully
someone
out
there
really
enjoys
this
brew
and
will
review
it
easy
to
drink
i
guess
i
just
dont
want
to
go
back
and
drink
it
again
but
its
their
entry
beer
gateway
i
guess
one
of
my
favorite
beers
who
doesnt
like
a
blonde
from
my
home
town
of
the
big
d
good
micro
brewed
beer
in
a
can
pretty
much
what
it
claims
to
be
blonde
colored
beer
smell
is
sweet
cereal
notes
taste
is
a
sweet
beer
fat
with
a
yeasty
start
and
a
corn
pops
finish
mouthfeel
is
really
slick
and
buttery
the
really
makes
it
drinkable
hop
presences
is
a
nonfactor
think
they
were
going
for
an
easy
drinking
crowd
pleasure
and
even
though
i
might
reach
for
a
bombshell
blonde
first
dallas
blonde
remains
a
solid
texas
blonde
option
overall
i
like
this
alot
and
if
i
had
more
access
to
it
i
would
put
this
in
the
rotation
for
summer
and
probably
all
year
plenty
of
flavor
and
extremely
drinkable
i
would
definitely
recommend
this
one
86100
drinkable
enough
beer
but
not
one
of
deep
ellums
frontliners
thanks
duff247
for
the
opportunity
the
can
is
correct
this
goes
down
easy
while
its
difficult
to
drink
while
laughing
at
the
overwrought
hand
wringing
over
the
slogan
without
shooting
beer
out
your
nose
it
can
be
done
and
this
is
worth
chasing
down
its
nothing
amazing
and
wont
change
your
life
in
any
meaningful
way
but
it
is
a
solid
blonde
ale
perfect
for
nights
on
the
deck
of
afternoons
by
the
grill
when
you
just
want
a
beer
without
having
to
think
hard
about
it
do
rated
to
style
nothing
offputting
about
this
beer
but
nothing
that
stands
out
either
a
fine
alternative
to
mainsteam
lagers
thanks
for
this
one
kojevergas
again
the
brew
is
super
cloudy
with
debris
which
makes
me
think
the
sixpack
i
picked
up
is
old
the
21214
printed
on
it
might
be
a
bestby
date
but
its
still
really
good
if
it
were
closer
to
4
abv
id
consider
it
a
perfect
session
beer
at
5
2
its
still
a
a
good
one
and
a
beer
ill
definitely
be
picking
up
again
low
c
o
the
look
and
smell
had
me
optimistic
but
the
taste
and
mouthfeel
didnt
back
them
up
its
certainly
not
the
worst
beer
ive
ever
poured
out
of
a
can
but
its
also
definitely
not
the
best
passing
over
some
old
hand
written
reviews
i
remember
liking
this
one
a
little
bit
more
than
what
the
rating
says
guess
im
gonna
have
to
drink
it
again
on
to
the
notes
orange
body
hoppy
aroma
but
not
too
overwhelming
light
body
with
a
hoppy
resinous
presence
crisp
and
dry
to
the
palate
in
the
end
easy
comes
easy
goes
can
given
to
me
from
a
friend
pours
into
my
tulip
glass
all
head
and
then
some
taking
a
while
to
get
this
into
liquid
form
jeez
once
the
head
dissipates
we
have
a
hazy
golden
color
with
still
lots
of
fluffy
white
head
on
top
aroma
of
very
light
pale
malts
some
floral
hops
dry
with
little
sweetness
in
the
nose
flavor
is
hay
a
hint
of
floral
hop
nearly
no
malt
backbone
and
a
slightly
dirty
finish
light
bodied
as
would
be
expected
from
a
session
beer
with
lower
carbonation
than
i
expected
overall
a
mediocre
brew
but
inoffensive
and
seems
like
something
that
a
larger
group
would
enjoy
at
a
cookout
atmosphere
is
pretty
solid
golden
hue
bubbly
head
and
some
persistent
lacing
bread
accentuated
with
honey
and
lemon
pungent
bread
with
a
crisp
hop
and
harsh
lemon
overall
this
is
a
pretty
good
quaff
pours
out
to
a
nice
frothy
white
head
and
dies
down
to
a
permanent
thin
layer
of
foam
lacing
is
minimal
but
it
tries
color
is
a
hazy
yellow
and
tons
of
bubbles
rising
aroma
is
grainy
malty
crackery
and
a
hint
of
hops
flavor
is
a
balance
of
malt
sweetness
and
mild
hop
bitterness
finishes
crisp
mouthfeel
is
big
for
the
style
overall
a
good
alternative
to
adjunct
lagers
overall
great
beer
out
of
a
can
easy
to
drink
id
pick
this
up
over
any
mainstream
domestic
to
stand
out
a
little
with
friends
who
cant
get
away
from
the
norm
and
it
wont
overpower
them
a
furious
of
bubbles
results
in
a
loosely
packed
but
tall
and
fluffy
white
head
that
settles
when
she
gets
good
and
ready
color
is
pale
yellow
with
a
winking
clarity
light
fruits
pear
grapes
lemon
malt
and
even
some
pepper
to
the
nose
this
broad
smells
good
light
and
fruity
as
expected
on
the
tongue
and
goes
down
easy
with
that
simplicity
reserved
for
nights
like
this
when
it
all
just
comes
together
overall
fantastic
blonde
very
friendly
and
drinkable
but
still
has
flavorful
elements
that
make
it
interesting
light
grainy
malt
with
a
modest
fruit
and
hop
combo
that
keeps
it
from
being
too
boring
mouthfeel
falls
just
short
of
medium
for
the
style
but
makes
up
for
it
by
being
perfectly
carbonated
and
mildly
creamy
it
reminds
me
a
bit
of
southern
stars
bombshell
with
less
sweetness
and
body
both
have
nice
grains
and
a
subtle
hop
i
think
this
is
pretty
good
i
have
already
bought
two
sixers
on
my
various
forays
to
the
metroplex
and
as
it
gets
hotter
this
beer
will
only
become
more
appealing
this
is
a
perfect
choice
to
grab
a
sixer
of
before
heading
to
a
rangers
game
in
midjune
on
tap
at
the
brewery
the
beer
pours
an
orange
color
with
a
white
head
the
first
things
to
come
through
in
the
aroma
are
biscuit
malt
and
a
hint
of
grass
i
also
get
a
bit
of
orange
citrus
but
it
is
subtle
the
flavor
is
a
bit
different
the
toffee
and
biscuit
malt
notes
add
some
nice
sweet
character
which
is
complimented
by
the
orange
and
grass
notes
from
the
hops
there
is
also
an
earthy
character
in
the
flavor
which
is
quite
nice
thin
mouthfeel
and
medium
carbonation
nice
beer
d
this
was
an
interesting
brew
but
the
scent
and
taste
werent
super
well
composed
the
body
was
nice
but
the
finish
wasnt
very
smooth
so
it
was
not
incredibly
easy
to
drink
doesnt
seem
like
the
sort
of
beer
you
would
want
to
age
but
maybe
a
few
years
could
help
this
one
gel
and
mellow
fresh
is
not
worth
having
more
than
once
pours
an
orange
like
color
white
head
and
lacing
aroma
of
potpourri
herbs
and
citrus
citrus
and
vanilla
in
the
flavor
blending
with
spicy
herbs
a
clash
of
flavor
slightly
acidic
though
short
lived
and
medium
bodied
well
carbonated
semi
dry
weird
beer
the
flavors
didnt
really
work
overall
not
a
bad
beer
just
one
that
is
too
sweet
for
me
not
real
special
fairly
delicious
goes
well
with
food
tastes
like
standardfare
imperial
porter
o
this
would
work
well
featuring
the
vanilla
and
stone
fruit
or
the
stone
fruit
and
sour
unfortunately
the
sour
doesnt
complement
the
more
prominent
fruitvanilla
well
though
the
beer
as
a
whole
does
pair
well
with
the
holst
suite
flavor
is
interesting
but
not
evocative
taste
profile
of
belgian
orange
dark
chocolate
if
you
like
orange
chocolate
u
r
going
to
like
this
imho
a
bit
of
a
mess
but
bounus
points
for
originality
starting
to
sour
a
little
which
matches
the
apricot
well
glad
i
had
this
one
clear
gold
small
white
frothy
head
smells
of
apricot
vanilla
cardamom
a
little
too
sweet
and
for
my
liking
weird
taste
not
pleasant
but
not
undrinkable
either
first
bells
tasted
and
am
enjoying
the
planets
tastetangerine
apricot
hints
of
vanilla
and
a
subtle
hop
note
interesting
flavor
and
character
just
wasnt
that
pleasant
went
sour
quick
owhile
this
is
an
interesting
and
unique
beer
it
is
not
one
of
bells
best
efforts
overall
i
ended
up
getting
a
good
amount
of
these
and
i
am
actually
happy
i
am
unlike
most
who
did
at
first
i
really
liked
the
taste
but
thought
the
balance
was
way
off
after
a
couple
months
in
the
bottle
the
balance
became
really
nice
and
even
drinkable
stiff
could
be
slightly
less
medicinal
this
could
honestly
be
the
worst
beer
ive
ever
had
3
335
00
wow
not
good
in
any
meaningful
way
and
what
a
disappointment
for
bells
with
the
caveat
here
being
if
you
were
looking
for
some
sort
of
oddly
flavored
iced
tea
this
beer
would
be
on
the
menu
thats
what
it
reminded
me
of
some
sort
of
funky
apricot
peach
cardamom
iced
tea
although
i
personally
wouldnt
drink
this
whether
it
was
labeled
beer
or
tea
i
guess
this
planet
series
is
an
experiment
but
its
one
i
wish
i
hadnt
paid
to
participate
in
its
off
to
an
overall
mediocre
start
at
best
this
particular
beer
by
the
way
lowers
the
curve
way
way
down
very
bitter
taste
to
it
overall
i
enjoyed
this
immensely
and
would
love
another
venus
seems
to
be
an
experiment
that
fell
short
for
my
palate
perhaps
i
expected
more
from
bells
but
this
one
wasnt
for
me
the
adjuncts
seemed
to
compete
rather
than
blend
together
in
any
meaningful
way
as
i
mentioned
i
think
my
feelings
would
be
different
had
this
been
done
without
the
overwhelming
cardamom
this
was
odd
for
an
american
blonde
ale
it
is
really
sour
i
guess
thats
from
the
fruit
they
added
however
this
was
absolutely
terrible
tasted
like
they
came
up
with
the
recipe
by
throwing
darts
at
a
dartboard
oh
look
cardamom
vanilla
apricot
the
flavors
didnt
blend
at
all
a
total
mess
and
one
of
the
few
beers
i
have
drain
poured
that
was
meant
to
taste
that
way
theres
no
other
way
to
say
this
than
an
alcoholic
red
bull
with
sour
patch
floaters
not
my
cup
of
tea
i
kind
of
feel
like
a
2
is
being
nice
this
is
a
truly
awful
beer
i
cannot
believe
bells
bottled
this
just
wow
a
mess
of
rancid
flavors
with
some
apricot
wife
and
i
did
not
finish
the
12oz
bottle
we
split
if
you
like
fruity
blondes
its
great
but
not
everyones
first
choice
of
style
all
i
can
say
about
this
beer
is
yuck
this
is
bottled
a
with
a
hint
of
apricot
lots
of
apricot
not
the
best
mars
was
real
good
though
after
looking
at
all
the
mediocre
reviews
of
this
beer
i
had
very
low
expectations
however
venus
turned
out
to
be
one
of
the
most
pleasant
surprises
i
have
ever
come
across
astonishingly
complex
and
unique
in
so
many
different
facets
this
beer
seems
to
be
an
incredibly
successful
experiment
by
the
folks
at
bells
overall
i
can
see
what
bells
was
going
for
but
the
vanilla
is
too
strong
and
cardamom
simply
does
not
work
with
vanilla
the
cardamom
works
with
the
honey
but
the
vanilla
just
doesnt
match
up
well
too
tart
for
my
taste
i
decided
to
try
this
much
maligned
ale
and
i
found
it
to
be
tart
refreshing
and
above
all
else
tasty
admittedly
this
has
a
unique
taste
profile
not
many
brews
have
a
sweet
apricot
taste
that
lingers
on
and
it
isnt
something
that
i
would
choose
to
have
too
often
as
an
occasional
treat
id
say
this
is
delicious
beer
tastes
great
but
looks
and
smells
ight
this
one
has
been
getting
raggedon
as
the
worst
of
the
bunch
but
so
far
i
think
its
the
best
of
the
bunch
didnt
get
around
to
trying
mars
though
i
really
did
not
like
this
beer
i
took
a
few
sips
and
couldnt
finish
it
it
tasted
too
medicinal
and
sweet
i
actually
kind
of
liked
it
the
sourness
the
flavors
very
interesting
brew
might
not
be
able
to
do
more
than
12oz
in
one
sitting
but
id
definitely
try
it
again
o
a
unique
blonde
ale
worth
trying
especially
if
you
like
vanilla
flavored
ales
tmo
truth
in
advertising
all
the
flavors
are
present
honey
apricot
cadmium
vanilla
and
it
comes
across
very
candy
like
sort
of
artificial
tasting
not
bad
but
the
kind
of
brew
you
try
a
single
of
not
the
kind
that
you
would
want
a
4
or
6
pack
of
novel
and
unique
and
not
half
bad
lets
call
it
interesting
a
bit
of
a
fizzy
fruit
drink
kind
of
packed
on
10214
poured
into
a
pint
glass
this
has
some
lively
carbonation
but
no
head
clear
and
golden
aromas
of
sweetness
apricot
and
slight
vanilla
taste
is
oddtart
and
bitter
at
the
same
time
overpowers
anything
else
here
really
lingers
rough
brew
drain
pour
was
with
4
other
people
tasting
this
and
it
was
horrid
i
cannot
imagine
that
the
brewers
tasted
this
sober
i
hope
that
the
little
sour
smell
that
i
got
in
the
nose
will
come
out
more
with
some
age
really
good
beer
and
really
excited
about
it
the
apricot
honey
cardamom
and
vanilla
beans
are
all
prevalent
not
sure
if
they
are
all
supposed
to
be
together
though
glad
this
is
only
a
12oz
bottle
flavor
is
strangely
close
to
the
taste
of
redbull
the
body
is
light
and
the
crispness
has
a
firm
nip
without
dirupting
the
smoothness
that
goes
creamy
as
it
builds
off
a
consistent
carbonation
it
want
my
favorite
taste
i
didnt
want
to
write
a
review
but
have
to
fantastic
fruity
and
a
bit
sour
luckily
this
is
a
beer
that
is
only
being
brewed
once
as
i
would
not
seek
this
out
or
even
drink
again
oh
jesus
oh
my
i
think
to
my
self
as
i
take
the
first
sip
there
is
a
lot
going
on
here
and
it
is
mostly
bad
oddly
soured
fruits
mixed
with
vanilla
candle
wax
and
musky
honey
tones
on
the
tongue
this
cant
be
what
they
were
shooting
for
here
really
not
enjoyable
to
drink
at
all
i
really
wanted
to
like
this
beer
especially
because
of
how
hard
it
was
to
get
but
i
just
dont
nothing
good
to
say
so
i
wont
say
any
more
at
all
1st
review
a
truly
unique
brew
apricots
and
honey
up
front
and
a
slight
taste
of
vanilla
didnt
catch
much
of
the
cardamom
and
wouldnt
have
guessed
it
was
there
if
the
label
hadnt
said
so
smells
interesting
and
tastes
exactly
the
same
not
bad
per
se
but
definitely
not
something
id
reach
for
again
nonetheless
glad
i
got
to
try
this
as
its
definitely
an
interesting
beer
this
beer
tasted
really
bad
bells
venus
45
a
very
unique
tasting
beer
combining
the
sweet
acidic
juiciness
of
apricots
and
the
smooth
richness
of
vanilla
beans
well
crafted
beer
the
pairing
however
isnt
that
complimentary
o
it
is
an
attack
on
the
senses
the
aroma
and
flavor
are
huge
i
enjoy
the
apricot
and
vanilla
aspects
i
am
still
not
sure
if
i
grasp
the
cardamom
it
is
interesting
and
definitely
worth
a
try
mouthfeel
is
good
and
overall
i
like
this
one
9pm
i
would
rather
drink
miller
lite
quite
possibly
one
of
the
worst
beers
ive
ever
had
i
usually
will
not
waste
a
beer
but
half
way
through
i
couldnt
stomach
anymore
and
dumped
it
out
i
valiant
effort
however
there
really
is
nothing
appealing
about
this
beer
overpoweringunbalanced
on
the
sweettart
apricot
the
only
thing
keeping
it
from
being
a
drain
pour
was
the
15
price
tag
on
the
6
pack
hoping
for
much
better
with
mercury
this
month
poured
a
cloudy
golden
body
with
a
thin
cap
of
foam
it
looks
alright
though
appearance
is
the
weakest
element
of
the
beer
scents
of
fresh
apricot
vanilla
light
cardamom
sugar
cookielike
malt
sweetness
a
slight
floral
aroma
is
also
present
overall
impression
of
aroma
is
of
a
wonderfully
fruity
and
sweet
beer
with
a
big
hit
of
apricot
but
also
showcasing
the
vanilla
and
cardamom
additions
and
a
bit
of
the
malt
very
nice
flavor
begins
lightly
sweet
and
sour
with
notes
of
vanilla
sweet
and
lightly
sour
apricot
juice
and
very
light
sweet
spiciness
likely
from
the
cardamom
middle
moves
into
a
flavor
profile
that
is
very
strongly
reminiscent
of
the
tart
flesh
near
the
apricot
pit
with
lesser
amounts
of
vanilla
still
present
finish
is
sweet
and
tart
with
notes
of
tart
apricot
flesh
vanilla
and
a
background
of
sweet
spices
aftertaste
is
sweet
and
tart
with
notes
of
apricot
vanilla
and
cardamom
overall
impression
of
flavor
is
of
a
nice
fruit
beer
one
that
melds
the
sweetness
of
apricot
with
the
tartness
of
the
innermost
flesh
and
blends
it
well
with
vanilla
and
cardamom
notes
my
only
complaint
is
that
i
wish
there
was
a
bit
more
assertiveness
to
the
malt
mouthfeel
is
medium
bodied
with
light
carbonation
and
a
lightly
tart
feel
overall
impression
of
mouthfeel
is
of
a
nicely
done
beer
that
captures
the
feel
of
eating
an
apricot
overall
this
is
a
fantastic
beer
more
experimental
than
mars
it
has
a
wonderful
aroma
a
beautiful
flavor
and
a
lovely
mouthfeel
quite
nice
and
well
worth
hunting
down
my
nearly
inverted
pour
following
a
pop
of
the
cap
created
two
fingers
of
fluffy
offwhite
head
with
low
retention
it
fell
like
a
souffle
after
the
oven
door
has
been
slammed
shut
but
it
left
some
wonderful
lacing
in
its
wake
color
was
a
goldenamber
srm
5
o
an
interesting
beer
overall
it
was
enjoyable
and
refreshing
enough
though
almost
more
like
a
hard
cider
than
a
beer
pours
gold
with
almost
zero
head
aroma
starts
off
with
the
hit
of
cardamom
paired
with
apricot
a
touch
of
grain
and
vanilla
bean
round
things
out
aroma
starts
off
tart
an
spicy
finishes
out
sweeter
and
richer
tastes
like
candied
apricot
mixed
with
cardamom
and
paired
with
a
little
vanilla
medium
bodied
slight
activity
overall
interesting
beer
and
it
grew
on
me
the
more
i
drank
it
good
balance
in
the
use
of
ingredients
but
in
the
end
i
just
wasnt
much
a
fan
o
this
is
the
only
american
blonde
ale
that
ive
had
that
has
flavor
ill
give
them
that
but
this
was
just
all
over
the
place
its
not
terrible
but
probably
should
stay
a
one
time
release
3
5
just
for
sheer
uniqueness
the
nose
is
spice
coriander
barnyard
yeast
apricot
jam
vanilla
and
heavy
floral
hop
content
the
flavor
is
the
big
let
down
what
a
disappointment
lots
of
apricot
but
the
coriander
spices
and
flowers
ruin
it
it
is
very
soapy
astringent
and
grainy
and
thin
a
bit
of
a
mess
gold
in
color
with
some
haziness
from
suspended
sediment
a
fingernail
of
off
white
head
sits
on
top
faint
overly
sweet
aroma
of
apricots
is
hard
to
pickup
the
flavor
is
an
intenselycloying
sweetness
quickly
giving
way
to
a
hefty
dose
of
herbal
cardamom
theres
moderate
carbonation
and
its
syrupy
maybe
too
weird
for
some
with
apricot
juice
cardamom
vanilla
bean
and
honey
i
personally
think
this
thing
is
amazing
expertly
balanced
between
all
these
unique
and
not
often
paired
elements
it
really
does
work
and
they
really
all
do
get
tasted
there
is
a
funny
tang
to
the
nose
the
apricot
and
the
vanilla
the
most
robust
additives
and
a
curious
yeast
character
with
some
booze
too
the
taste
is
amazing
through
the
honey
and
the
apricot
are
really
vibrant
and
authentic
up
front
with
some
sweeter
and
richer
barley
malt
which
the
cardamom
is
just
subtle
in
the
middle
and
brings
out
the
hoppier
side
of
this
and
the
vanilla
is
all
in
the
finish
sweet
and
circling
back
to
the
apricot
in
a
well
timed
reprise
to
say
its
complex
is
an
understatement
and
i
see
why
others
have
not
reviewed
this
beer
favorably
but
i
for
one
admire
its
reach
and
think
its
as
well
put
together
as
it
possibly
could
be
considering
its
constituent
parts
cant
wait
for
the
rest
of
the
series
o
it
is
almost
awesome
i
love
the
way
the
vanilla
finishes
it
off
the
overpowering
apricot
leaves
it
is
a
bit
of
a
disappointment
this
beer
is
foul
it
reminds
me
much
more
of
the
experiments
of
another
michigan
brewery
shorts
many
of
shorts
creations
are
wildly
offtarget
and
this
is
just
like
that
massive
apricot
and
coriander
in
the
nose
huh
and
the
taste
combination
is
just
bizarre
and
not
in
any
way
enjoyable
cloying
sweetness
that
gets
shattered
by
an
odd
twang
sort
of
bitter
sort
of
chemical
i
feel
like
im
being
generous
with
my
rating
overall
dug
mars
and
trust
bells
i
e
will
grab
the
next
in
the
series
but
this
aint
for
me
appearance
was
not
overly
odd
thin
head
and
great
color
nose
carried
the
apricot
but
i
didnt
get
much
else
taste
roller
coaster
as
the
apricots
came
first
followed
by
the
cardamom
and
finally
a
weird
finish
that
i
cant
even
begin
to
explain
mouthfeel
was
syrupy
in
a
bad
way
with
an
oddly
pleasant
aftertaste
of
apricots
brewed
once
so
i
guess
we
wont
have
to
endure
this
again
o
i
know
this
beer
gets
a
lot
of
hate
on
ba
but
i
actually
enjoyed
it
quite
a
bit
although
i
will
admit
i
am
a
whore
for
cardamom
the
aroma
is
wonderful
the
taste
doesnt
live
up
but
is
still
good
and
its
very
unique
i
really
cant
remember
ever
having
a
beer
that
was
anything
close
to
this
4
taste
is
less
than
spectacular
first
thing
i
noticed
was
a
thickness
on
the
palate
and
a
sugary
sweetness
the
malt
is
pretty
rich
and
the
honey
adds
sugar
too
there
is
a
bright
apricot
that
loses
its
way
amidst
the
earthy
vanilla
that
gets
stronger
as
you
drink
and
the
cardamom
which
also
adds
earth
there
is
a
strange
spice
taste
int
eh
finish
with
a
tinge
of
alcohol
as
well
its
almost
a
plastic
like
taste
or
a
taste
like
something
in
there
is
synthetic
there
is
a
sour
undertaste
overall
finishes
with
a
bitterness
form
hops
that
frankly
saves
it
and
makes
it
drinkable
that
hops
presence
comes
to
the
palate
to
lighten
up
all
that
thickness
and
thick
flavor
and
leaves
a
bit
of
bitterness
alongside
the
tart
apricot
this
frankly
tastes
like
a
spiked
fruit
punch
and
the
mouthfeel
is
just
too
heavy
i
do
not
think
these
flavors
work
well
together
overall
to
me
if
they
kept
the
base
and
just
used
the
vanilla
beans
apricot
juice
this
beer
would
rate
much
better
the
cardamom
to
me
is
what
made
this
beer
weird
at
fridge
temp
the
vanilla
and
apricot
really
clash
as
it
warmed
they
started
playing
nicely
together
this
bottle
is
almost
5
months
old
im
thinking
some
more
age
might
do
it
some
favors
i
definitely
like
it
more
now
than
when
it
was
fresh
will
report
back
in
the
summer
after
cracking
open
another
bottle
o
this
beer
will
appeal
to
very
few
people
the
fact
the
ratings
indicate
it
is
okay
rather
than
poor
is
likely
due
to
bells
reputation
as
a
world
class
brewery
i
like
bells
as
much
as
any
craft
beer
enthusiast
and
will
continue
to
buy
their
beer
but
this
one
is
just
horrible
disappointing
not
sure
what
the
intention
was
here
but
it
sure
seems
that
an
innocent
mild
beer
was
created
to
support
a
blizzard
of
clashing
adjuncts
we
have
some
of
that
throw
it
in
the
pot
lessee
what
happens
not
good
o
i
enjoy
blonde
ales
and
american
blonde
ales
this
one
is
noteworthy
for
being
different
just
not
my
favorite
that
i
have
had
i
would
prefer
a
less
bitter
taste
however
i
think
apricots
go
better
with
wheat
ales
than
an
imperial
blonde
this
was
undrinkable
drain
poured
halfway
through
the
bottle
couldnt
finish
o
how
did
they
release
this
beer
i
find
it
hard
that
a
sensory
panel
would
agree
that
this
tasted
good
i
love
dfh
but
this
really
seems
like
something
that
would
be
released
by
them
i
hate
to
say
it
but
this
is
disgusting
it
is
basically
undrinkable
at
least
a
macro
beer
would
be
drinkable
tasted
like
cough
syrup
pretty
gross
unfortunate
because
i
like
a
lot
of
bells
beers
orange
body
with
a
soapy
white
head
super
sweet
with
mint
and
spice
instantly
cloying
ouch
palate
assault
odd
and
gross
avoid
this
is
an
interesting
beer
to
say
the
least
i
dont
hate
it
but
im
not
crazy
about
it
i
know
this
will
sound
weird
but
id
describe
it
as
great
lakes
christmas
ale
with
apricot
juice
it
is
a
beer
thats
fitting
for
the
holidays
unlike
my
whole
trooper
immersion
deal
im
not
listening
to
holst
right
now
but
i
think
i
can
remember
enough
of
the
piece
to
keep
in
mind
during
this
whole
endeavor
this
stuff
pours
a
clear
straw
topped
by
a
finger
of
dirty
white
foam
the
nose
comprises
orange
zest
powdered
sugar
creamsicle
light
coriander
vanilla
and
a
touch
of
lemon
peel
the
taste
brings
in
more
of
the
same
the
vanilla
and
spices
leading
the
way
followed
by
a
strong
wave
of
orange
and
apricot
juices
which
end
up
washing
out
all
else
some
mild
lemonlike
tartness
pervades
the
finish
the
body
is
a
light
medium
with
a
light
moderate
carbonation
and
a
fluid
feel
overall
a
nice
enough
beer
but
i
think
the
fruit
juices
overpower
the
proceedings
not
really
a
peaceful
situation
if
you
ask
me
but
also
not
entirely
chaotic
pours
a
slightly
hazy
blonde
is
orange
color
with
white
head
that
retains
decently
the
nose
starts
with
heavy
vanilla
and
apricot
notes
reminds
me
of
orange
cream
soda
a
bit
but
with
candied
apricot
instead
of
orange
the
cardamom
brings
a
spicy
herbal
character
at
the
back
end
the
taste
starts
with
a
strong
tartness
from
the
apricot
the
tartness
was
not
too
prevalent
in
the
nose
but
dominates
the
flavor
the
vanilla
softens
it
a
bit
before
the
cardamom
takes
over
giving
the
end
a
spicy
flavor
the
combo
of
flavors
is
quite
odd
and
totally
unique
each
of
the
adjuncts
stand
out
and
are
identifiable
with
the
exception
of
the
honey
overall
im
glad
to
have
tried
this
unique
and
creative
brew
even
if
the
flavors
dont
harmonize
that
nicely
o
i
dont
necessarily
think
this
beer
is
as
bad
as
the
average
rating
makes
it
out
to
be
it
is
a
strange
beer
in
many
ways
though
worth
trying
for
its
novelty
value
overall

i
appreciate
what
bells
was
trying
to
do
here
but
this
was
just
not
for
me
the
blend
of
fruit
floral
and
vanilla
left
me
with
an
unshakable
yup
hand
soap
impression
i
bought
this
one

it
was

overall

but
was
very

in

this
bottle
will
be
tough
to
drink
bells
really
struck
out
with
this
one
i
get
dirty
vegetation
a
weird
cleaning
product
like
taste
and
a
touch
of
junky
vanilla
on
the
palate
drainpoured
after
three
sips
too
sweet
and
a
strange
aftertaste
to
my
palate
overall
perhaps
one
of
the
most
divisive
beers
ever
targeting
the
craft
beer
community
with
the
majority
coming
out
on
the
negative
side
still
i
found
the
beer
fascinating
with
layers
of
flavor
unfolding
while
i
am
glad
to
have
tasted
it
i
doubt
that
i
would
seek
it
out
again
this
is
a
unique
beer
fruitiness
and
cardamom
in
the
nose
brings
to
mind
something
belgian
the
taste
is
tart
apricot
with
a
candylike
aspect
from
the
vanilla
beans
the
finish
has
a
winelike
aspect
to
it
this
didnt
seem
like
my
it
was
going
to
be
my
thing
i
dont
like
sweet
spiced
or
sour
beers
and
this
is
a
bit
of
all
three
however
the
flavors
in
this
are
very
complex
and
blend
into
a
harmonious
whole
a
successful
and
interesting
experiment
one
finger
rocky
orangyoffwhite

unobtrusive
lightly
malty
fruity

fruit

the
flavor
followed
by

the
apricot
just
didnt
work
for
me
at
all
medium
bodied
with
moderate
carbonation
and
a
short
finish
sorry
but
this
just
isnt
for
me
not
a
fan
too
sour
for
me
although
if
you
like
sours
this
is
really
good
this
is
a
hard
one
to
describe
tastes
like
a
weird
fruit
cocktail
creamsicle
yeah
thats
it
overall
i
am
so
happy
i
got
three
more
of
these
overall
im
almost
unsure
if
i
should
rate
this
right
now
it
is
simply
so
different
from
anything
ive
had
that
i
feel
i
need
to
let
it
sink
in
for
a
bit
that
said
im
digging
it
more
and
more
as
the
glass
begins
to
empty
it
was
just
a
shock
to
the
taste
buds
at
first
much
better
than
expected
i
see
how
some
dont
get
this
but
as
a
chef
i
can
fully
appreciate
how
the
apricot
and
cardamom
work
together
great
medium
body
with
nice
carbonation
that
allows
the
flavors
to
shine
through
tastes
like
a
hard
tea
so
maybe
not
what
people
are
looking
for
in
a
beer
but
i
can
fully
appreciate
how
the
flavors
work
here
glad
i
took
a
chance
with
this
o
id
classify
this
more
as
a
fruit
beer
than
as
a
blonde
ale
and
its
a
decent
fruit
beer
im
seldom
in
the
mood
for
a
fruit
beer
however
o
a
great
offering
but
imperfect
less
objective
reviewers
will
also
deduct
points
due
to
high
expectations
from
the
hype
and
price
this
beer
has
a
lot
to
offer
both
a
strong
suit
and
a
weakness
each
major
flavor
is
clear
and
ample
and
most
work
well
together
the
fruit
and
cardamom
certainly
do
but
the
strong
notes
of
vanilla
made
it
too
much
a
good
adventurous
concept
that
had
very
good
realization
and
it
is
a
calming
brew
but
ultimately
unbalanced
my
relatively
high
score
looks
on
the
bright
side
of
their
adventurous
goal
and
less
on
objective
balanced
traditional
beer
scoring
any
adjunctscorners
will
probably
burn
their
hands
just
holding
this
bottle
12

the
beer
pours
a
slightly
hazy
goldenorange
color
with
about
an
inch
offwhite
head
head
retention
and
lacing
are
both
decent
enough
aroma
is
fruity
and
sweet
it
smells
like
apricots
vanilla
cardamom
honey
and
a
sweet
spiciness
i
think
the
taste
is
pretty
much
just
like
the
aroma
its
sweet
fruity
and
a
bit
spicy
and
somewhat
tart
too
i
do
think
its
more
fruity
and
sweet
than
anything
else
mouthfeelbody
is
medium
its
a
bit
slick
and
smooth
with
a
moderate

this
sure
doesnt

beer
thats

abv
overall
i
liked
this
but
if
you
dont
like
sweetfruity
beers
then
you
might
not
like
this
as
much
as
i
did
2
79
a
single
bottle
btw
whats
up
with
holst
he
calls
venus
the
bringer
of
peace
which
according
to
planetary
science
is
total
bs
its
the
hottest
planet
in
the
solar
system
and
it
has
a
super
dense
atmosphere
clearly
he
was
interpreting
the
planets
from
a
mythological
standpointlove
beauty
femininity
he
wrote
venus
as
a
resolution
to
mars
the
bringer
of
war
i
wonder
if
my
perception
of
this
beer
would
be
different
if
i
had
tasted
mars
first
mostly
clear
gold
covered
with
a
fine
layer
of
milky
white
bubbles
smells
like
chai
tea
sweet
powdery
vanilla
cardamom
graham
cracker
and
light
dried
apricot
flavor
is
a
surprisingly
tart
bite
of
apricot
along
with
lemon
creamy
vanilla
herbs
and
flowers
creamy
dry
feel
not
cloying
the
aroma
is
the
best
part
a
little
too
much
dried
apricot
in
the
flavor
for
me
amber
slightly
hazy
and
a
white
head
that
fades
reasonably
fast
this
smells
like
chai
maybe
fruitier
sweet
cinnamon
cardamom
brown
sugary
scents
sweet
citrus
cocoa
and
fleshy
tropical
pitted
fruits
very
aromtic
taste
is
sweet
tropical
delightfully
fruity
and
sourly
bitter
with
farmy
funk
excellent
foamy
mouthfeel
a
very
unusual
surprisingly
pleasant
beer
sour
an
refreshing
the
smell
is
outstanding
the
apricot
delivers
a
strong
sour
lemon
like
punch
has
faint
spice
and
real
nice
sourness
and
complexity
on
the
back
end
i
cant
believe
this
is
getting
scored
so
low
i
like
the
vanilla
notes
with
the
tart
apricot
and
cardamom
spice
in
the
finish
its
working
for
me
while
i
listened
to
gustav
holsts
venus
the
bringer

with
minimal

after
a

flavor
has
vanilla
all
over
the
base
is
a
tart
mild
citric
experience
of
the
apricot
juice
theres
alot
going
on
honey
cardamom
apricot
and
vanilla
compete
and
lack
cohesion
im
enjoying
it
but
its
a
challenging
beer
to
consume
mouthfeel
is
a
bit
cloying
some
residual
sweetness
and
something
in
the
texture
makes
it
tough
to
swallow
light
carbonation
doesnt
help
this
body
move
across
the
palate
any
better
overall
theres
ups
and
downs
i
appreciate
the
effort
but
i
can
see
why
theres
mixed
reviews
on
this
one
although
i
did
enjoy
it
o
a
good
and
interesting
beer
i
think
that
it
would
have
worked
better
in
a
spicy
saison
style
without
the
vanilla
it
was
a
fund
beer
to
drink
and
taste
overall
a
pretty
unique
twist
on
a
blonde
ale
that
comes
out
pretty
decent
nice
citrus
flavor
with
a
sweetness
that
avoids
becoming
too
messy
i
will
continue
to
buy
their
offerings
but
this
was
a
rare
giant
miss
overall
i
just
bought
one
of
these
i
am
glad
i
did
i
dont
think
i
could
ever
really
warm
up
to
this
one
thus
far
mars
is
the
better
of
the
two
offerings
of
this
series
by
a
large
margin
but
i
will
be
interested
in
seeing
what
the
rest
of
them
are
like
tart
apricot
up
front
with
warm
cardamom
and
vanilla
bean
on
the
back
end
a
bit
weird
but
unique
to
say
the
least
cant
truly
say
it
works
however
decent
effort
final
score
3
65
this
is
a
horrible
beer
that
does
not
represent
anything
well
rare
miss
from
a
fine
brewer
glad
i
was
limited
to
2
single
12ounce
bottles
at
the
package
store
not
even
close
to
what
i
thought
this
beer
would
taste
like
almost
tastes
like
a
mead
but
with
a
lot
more
carbonation
not
bad
but
not
that
good
either
poured
from
a
bottle
into
a
stemmed
pilsner
the
beer
is
a
bright
vibrant
orange
coloring
with
a
ton
of
carbonation
and
only
a
wispy
sparse
white
surface
coating
of
head
aromas
of
sweet
apricot
rich
honey
subtle
spices
and
toasted
grains
very
sweet
and
a
bit
lopsided
nose
flavors
are
very
tangy
and
sweet
forward
holy
hell
cloying
like
an
overpowering
piece
of
candy
the
honey
and
apricot
clash
a
bit
with
sweet
over
sweet
taking
out
their
frustrations
on
your
palate
slightly
sour
even
vanilla
notes
come
in
too
and
it
does
not
help
matters
yikes
oily
slick
body
with
a
slightly
sharp
edge
from
the
carbonation
the
aftertaste
is
very
cloying
with
a
tangy
tart
and
slightly
sour
blending
linger
slick
lingering
finish
this
one
is
not
good
glad
i
only
got
one
bottle
but
i
didnt
hate
it
this
is
without
a
doubt
the
worst
beer
i
have
ever
had
from
bells
way
out
of
balance
and
a
complete
mess
not
sure
what
the
goal
was
here
but
its
a
wad
of
character
and
a
mess
that
has
no
clear
definition
frankly
it
tastes
like
poor
homebrew
really
shocked
at
bells
on
this
one
enjoyed
from
a
12
oz
bottle
this
unique
brew
pours
a
hazy
amber
with
a
nice
layer
of
white
foam
that
dissipates
to
a
thin
pooling
layer
and
nice
lacing
nose
of
apricots
sweet
malts
and
an
herbal
note
i
can
not
put
my
finger
on
most
likely
cardamom
flavors
are
unique
with
sweetness
to
the
sides
and
tartness
to
the
front
and
back
mingling
with
apricots
and
vanilla
beans
as
it
warms
the
herbal
notes
are
enticing
with
a
sweet
tart
like
candy
flavor
being
rounded
out
by
nice
carbonation
to
make
this
one
very
pleasant
to
say
the
least
happy
to
have
tried
it
slightly
sweet
pleasant
beer
this
one
was
not
for
me
it
was
one
of
the
worst
tasting
beers
ive
tried
it
was
dry
and
unbalanced
and
i
didnt
care
for
the
apricot
or
cardamom
flavors
even
vanilla
a
flavor
i
generally
like
seemed
out
of
place
my
overall
takeaway
was
that
is
was
a
kitchen
sink
brew
as
in
we
at
bells
threw
everything
in
here
but
the
kitchen
sink
fruit
beers
are
not
my
favorite
style
but
i
really
appreciated
the
flavors
and
dry
mouth
feel
the
brew
is
refreshing
and
reminds
me
of
a
champagne
cocktail
from
new
years
eve
on
a
side
note
im
usually
not
a
huge
fan
of
brettanomyces
but
i
wonder
if
it
would
have
helped
this
one
a
bit
just
a
thought
they
started
off
with
mars
which
was
great
second
round
not
so
good
hopefully
this
planet
series
gets
better
avoid
bleh
if
for
the
hell
of
it
you
bought
every
flavor
of
yoplait
off
the
shelf
this
would
taste
like
the
worst
one
pretentious
label
should
say
yeast
instead
of
peace
initial
hit
of
apricot
hides
the
freshly
manufactured
diaper
taste
bells
was
a
holy
name
to
me
before
i
tried
this
i
came
to
ba
for
someone
to
describe
the
redeeming
qualities
of
this
beer
but
only
found
the
truth
feel
is
all
right
medium
light
body
with
moderate
carbonation
and
a
little
cloying
i
dont
like
this

i
feel
like
this

a
gimmicky

is

mediocre

with

but
quite
enjoyable
overall
apricot
sourness
and
cardamom
spices
dominate
the
taste
kind
of
blends
the
holiday
beer
flavor
with
a
fruited
berliner
the
taste
was
more
complicated
tart
and
spicy
apricot
fruitiness
was
tart
but
not
bitter
i
really
didnt
detect
any
honey
or
vanilla
until
it
had
warmed
up
considerably
and
then
only
because
i
knew
it
was
in
the
beer
and
i
was
looking
for
it
there
was
a
surprising
lack
of
sweetness
in
this
beer
i
expected
with
honey
and
apricot
it
would
present
sweeter
but
it
was
drying
and
tart
i
am
glad
i
tried
it
but
i
wouldnt
seek
it
out
again
cardamom
jumps
to
the
forefront
of
the
aroma
with
a
touch
of
must
and
vanilla
sandalwood
comes
to
mind
apricot
is
soft
and
subtle
theres
a
bit
of
funk
and
phenols
flavor
reveals
a
tart
and
sour
base
sweetened
slightly
by
the
vanilla
that
lingers
long
in
the
aftertaste
apricot
becomes
evident
in
the
tartsour
character
along
with
candied
orange
reminds
me
of
st
joes
childrens
vitamins
honey
sweetness
emerges
mid
palate
to
accompany
the
vanilla
cardamom
weaves
throughout
but
the
apricot
sourness
rules
the
day
very
interesting
but
i
wish
the
vanilla
were
dialed
down
a
bit
almost
shandy
like
had
high
hopes
for
this
one
but
left
much
to
be
desired
do
i
had
been
told
by
a
couple
good
friends
that
this
beer
was
a
letdown
before
i
tried
it
i
am
hardpressed
to
disagree
with
them
the
label
description
reads
malt
beverage
brewed
with
apricot
juice
and
honey
with
cardamom
and
vanilla
beans
added
that
description
is
either
a
recipe
for
a
really
tasty
beer
or
one
that
just
kind
of
is
there
all
muddled
sadly
its
the
latter
drain
pour
after
6
ounces
being
a
fan
of
sour
beers
i
enjoyed
the
slight
amount
of
tartness
behind
it
although
i
dont
like
fruit
in
my
beer
but
i
didnt
find
it
to
be
overpowering
overall
i
think
its
worthy
of
the
3
75
i
gave
it
finishing
with
the
unique
taste
of
citrus
but
without
its
associated
fructose
honey
or
candy
sweetness
the
ale
seems
to
capture
the
taste
of
orange
cream
sickle
but
without
much
of
its
sweetness
instead
a
vanilla
softness
soothes
the
senses
while
a
peppermint
bite
returns
in
echoes
a
bit
too
sweet
and
fruity
for
my
taste
also
the
spices
dont
really
blend
well
o
this
is
definetly
a
different
beer
the
flavors
just
dont
work
harmoniously
but
i
appreciate
bells
doing
something
different
off
flavors
and
sour
avoid
not
an
enjoyable
experience
on
3
different
occasions
o
the
aroma
and
flavor
was
all
over
the
place
and
so
was
the
taste
i
respect
that
they
tried
to
branch
out
and
do
something
adventurous
especially
by
eliminating
the
hop
bitterness
and
replacing
it
with
sourness
to
balance
the
sweetness
but
i
was
disappointed
overall
i
had
much
higher
expectations
after
mars
ipa
and
for
19
99
for
a
six
pack
it
better
be
amazing
the
other
beer
i
picked
up
while
at
the
liquor
store
was
fresh
zombie
dust
and
that
was
4
00
cheaper
you
cant
tell
me
that
someone
honestly
thinks
this
is
worth
4
more
than
zombie
dust
not
a
huge
fan
too
fruity
and
tar
for
my
taste
after
mars
i
was
pretty
excited
about
this
one
thought
its
was
going
to
be
a
solid
tripel
type
beer
but
sad
to
say
i
had
to
drain
pour
on
to
the
next
planet
because
this
one
was
bad
1
5
just
because
its
bells
i
really
do
like
this
fruity
tart
sour
of
a
beer
im
going
to
age
a
few
to
see
what
happens
and
if
those
colliding
flavors
ever
settle
down
instead
the
beer
is
boozy
and
unbalanced
the
spice
overpowers
just
a
messy
brew
in
general
overall
disappointed
in
this
brew
just
too
many
different
flavors
and
they
just
dont
mix
glad
i
only
purchased
a
single
this
was
quite
possibly
the
worst
beer
i
have
ever
tasted
these
flavors
do
not
meld
bells
struck
out
with
this
barely
could
get
through
the
glass
o
i
dont
know
at
first
i
thought
it
was
way
too
tart
and
would
be
a
chore
to
finish
some
warmth
brings
out
complexity
and
makes
for
a
more
enjoyable
beer
from
a
geeky
standpoint
im
glad
i
had
it
and
can
continue
the
planets
series
however
i
wouldnt
seek
out
any
extras
on
this
one
tastes
like
a
vanillaapricot
brandy
next
to
no
hop
flavor
that
i
get
full
of
flavor
and
lightly
carbonated
im
not
entirely
certain
this
isnt
beer
but
carbonated
apricot
juice
no
hops
no
malt
just
apricot
so
much
apricot
golden
with
a
soft
spicy
and
fruity
smell
the
smell
reminds
me
a
lot
of
a
christmas
type
of
spiced
beer
taste
is
very
acidic
with
a
mix
of
holiday
spices
cloves
cardamom
and
fruit
lemon
apple
peach
no
hops
alcohol
masked
well
a
pretty
unique
oddball
im
glad
i
only
got
a
bottle
at
this
price
point
this
beer
just
isnt
the
way
i
envisioned
it
and
maybe
thats
affecting
my
scoring
i
just
expected
something
more
refined
from
bells
a
great
man
once
asked
did
venus
sweep
you
off
your
feet
and
the
answer
is
no
no
it
didnt
really
not
my
style
mouthfeel
and
carbonation
are
ok
even
aroma
is
good
to
me
but
my
god
the
taste
is
odd
after
mars
i
came
into
this
with
high
expectations
and
while
i
appreciate
the
attempted
innovation
ill
be
more
than
satisfied
to
share
my
other
bottle
i
cant
believe
bells
actually
released
this
beer
to
the
public
no
balance
or
moderation
at
all
just
glad
bells
doesnt
fail
hard
like
this
on
a
regular
basis
you
have
to
really
really
really
like
apricot
to
like
this
beer
this
one
was
quite
bad
i
applaud
the
experiment
but
the
acidity
and
tartness
of
the
apricot
juice
overrides
everything
in
the
beer
i
was
looking
forward
to
the
vanilla
and
honey
notes
and
couldnt
do
anything
other
than
pucker
disappointed
by
this
iteration
of
the
planet
series
after
thoroughly
enjoying
mars
this
beer
smells
exactly
like
a
cream
soda
strong
spicy
vanilla
smell
some
juicy
apricot
the
flavor
is
acidic
bitter
unripened
apricot
with
vanilla
and
hints
of
cardamon
spice
not
that
nice
no
hops
medium
carbonation
overall
its
not
terrible
just
not
anything
delicious
its
very
unique
but
its
too
acidic
and
the
various
flavors
dont
work
together
nicely
im
glad
bells
is
being
creative
but
this
is
far
from
their
finest
hope
the
other
planets
come
out
better
interesting
and
quite
different
for
a
blonde
ale
smells
like
a
belgian
single
with
very
light
hints
of
vanilla
and
cardamom
tart
and
astringent
taste
with
light
fruit
and
vanilla
on
the
finish
very
bold
flavors
maybe
a
bit
too
acidic
and
not
enough
malt
or
sweetness
no
hops
to
be
found
o
this
really
resembles
some
sort
of
experimental
shorts
beer
more
than
anything
ive
had
from
bells
before
and
like
a
lot
of
shorts
beers
this
seems
to
be
a
love
it
or
hate
type
beer
i
dont
really
care
for
it
its
not
offense
just
not
a
fan
of
the
flavor

offering
bells
is
a
brewery
with
integrity
and
nothing
proves
that
better
than
third

beer
it
is
a
clean
flavourful
wellmalted
tastefully
hopped
ale
that
has
far
more
character
than
commercial
industrial
brewed
beers
but
is
still
every
bit
as
approachable
and
easygoing
anyone
who
remotely
likes
beer
should
find
this
a
delight
o
as
a
hoppy
blonde
this
isnt
turribly
successful
theres
way
too
much
hopmalt
clash
for
me
having
said
that
this
isnt
something
im
going
to
drainpour
its
only
kinda
crappy
instead
of
godawful
i
dont
need
to
have
this
one
again
o
one
dimensional
but
drinkable
bitterness
is
refreshing
but
almost
overdone
this
is
no
ordinary
blonde
ale
and
thats
probably
why
i
am
enjoying
it
highly
hop
forward
with
a
complimenting
citrus
angle
of
hop
and
yeast
which
works
nicely
third
coast
pours
a
gold
color
with
a
large
head
there
is
an
offensive
aroma
that
is
similar
to
cat
pee
the
taste
has
a
cat
pee
flavoring
with
a
strong
cereal
flavor
the
taste
is
very
light
and
rather
offensive
overall
this
is
an
avoidable
beer
not
too
much
good
can
be
said
o
true
to
the
style
but
im
not
a
fan
ended
up
dumping
half
the
bottle
was
hoping
more
from
bells
but
thats
more
my
high
expectations
talking
since
the
beer
stayed
within
the
style
o
overall
this
was
alright
i
mistaked
the
third
coast
beer
for
the
third
coast
ale
my
bad
none
the
less
this
is
sort
of
a
run
of
the
mill
blonde
ale
its
probably
great
for
a
hot
summer
barberque
but
its
cold
outside
right
now
and
im
not
really
feeling
it
still
to
each
his
own
try
it
if
you
like
lighter
ales
sometimes
im
lovin
this
beer
other
times
it
falls
flat
freshness
probably
has
a
great
deal
to
do
with
it
overall
this
is
obviously
supposed
to
be
an
easily
drinkable
craft
beer
honestly
it
is
not
immensely
different
from
lighter
colored
lagers
though
this
is
an
ale
but
does
include
a
good
depth
of
flavor
for
being
restricted
in
a
sense
to
the
guidelines
of
a
simple
style
if
this
came
in
cans
itd
be
a
great
easily
drinkable
tailgate
beer
come
football
season
poured
this
american
blonde
ale
from
a
12
oz
bottle
into
a
pint
glass
poured
a
clear
yellow
color
produced
a
small
white
head
average
retention
and
it
left
some
lacing
on
the
glass
the
aroma
consisted
of
malted
wheat
sweet
grain
light
in

there
was
a

o
this
would
be
great
for
any
outdoor
summer
day
very
easy
to
drink
but
still
very
quality
i
really
liked
it
like
i
said
its
like
bud
light
for
craft
beer
drinkers
palates
this
is
a
beer
for
taking
out
on
the
lake
for
a
hot
afternoon
of
fishing
refreshing
and
it
goes
down
like
a
champ
not
the
most
flavorful
thing
on
the
planet
but
it
gets
the
job
done
o
im
not
sure
age
has
ruined
it
its
still
tasty
would
have
again
super
drinkable
c
this
is
ideal
for
a
hot
weather
day
with
its
bitter
quenching
properties
but
at
times
this
one
can
be
too
harsh
still
worth
trying
epic
fail
overall
solid
but
not
great
sessionable
ale
that
would
work
well
on
a
hot
day
typical
bells
being
very
clean
i
would
not
go
out
of
my
way
for
this
but
a
fine
example
of
the
style
12oz
bottle
poured
into
a
pint
glass
clear
pale
gold
with
a
white
cap
aromas
of
fresh
hops
orange
slices
grains
crisp
mouthfeel
with
apparent
carbonation
easy
drinking
as
it
should
be
big
bitter
smack
at
each
sip
i
was
not
expecting
that
bitter
peppery
sweetness
is
short
and
fleeting
this
was
not
the
refreshing
drink
i
was
expecting
it
to
be
this
had
some
harshness
to
it
that
i
dont
think
belongs
in
this
light
simple
style
when
i
want
some
bitterness
ill
reach
for
a
ipa
or
hoppy
pa
with
a
blonde
i
expect
sweet
flavors
light
crisp
feel
and
an
ease
of
drinkability
this
was
not
that
not
my
cup
of
tea
pass
oan
average
boring
beer
nothing
offputting
nothing
to
write
home
about
is
this
unfiltered
nose
has
some
nice
tones
to
it
citrus
hits
me
at
the
start
but
seems
to
fade
fairly
soon
into
things
carries
more
spicy
hop
tone
to
it
than
i
would
have
expected
pretty
drinkable
though
the
hops
do
take
it
to
a
different
place
than
most
blondes
are
at
not
too
shabby
pours
a
semi
dark
yellow
with
a
frothy
white
head
smell
is
grainy
subtle
hops
hint
of
sweet
as
well
bitter
up
front
that
goes
all
the
way
through
it
covers
some
of
the
flavor
at
first
after
it
has
a
nice
malt
flavor
the
hops
is
there
with
some
sweetness
at
the
end
the
bitterness
stays
through
the
aftertaste
a
medium
mouthfeel
nice
and
smooth
nice
balance
after
the
first
few
sips
the
bitterness
doesnt
fit
well
in
the
beer
overall
a
good
beer
nice
flavors
not
something
i
would
get
all
the
time
but
a
good
beer
nonetheless

this
blondes
very
drinkable
with
a
great
nose
but
its
a
little
too
bitter
for
the
style
i
could
use
more
sweetness
like
it
enough
wouldnt
go
shopping
for
it
but
really
glad
i
had
it
overall
a
really
poor
showing
from
bells
here
i
think
i
see
what
theyre
getting
at
which
is
an
easy
drinking
beer
for
the
masses
they
have
succeeded
at
this
but
have
sacrificed
a
lot
in
the
process
translucent
golden
yellow
with
tons
of
sediment
nice
sticky
lacing
and
a
head
that
lasts
smells
sharp
pungent
and
bready
almost
meaty
not
much
hop
character
in
the
nose
to
speak
of
the
smell
is
almost
enough
to
turn
you
off
the
taste
is
almost
the
opposite
slightly
sweet
bready
and
a
nice
citrus
hop
bitterness
towards
the
end
as
the
beer
warms
the
tastes
seem
to
blend
and
it
gets
better
i
love
when
a
beer
does
that
mouthfeel
is
light
and
nicely
carbonated
this
is
a
good
session
beer
if
you
can
get
past
the
nose
i
think
my
tastes
have
changed
since
college
d
ok
low
abv
not
a
palate
killer
i
think
this
could
be
a
nice
session
overall
refreshing
and
simple
but
very
satisfying
nice
session
brew
really
good
stuff
a
tasty
refreshing
balanced
and
hopforward
blonde
ale
could
almost
call
this
a
pale
ale
well
done
o
i
could
easily
kill
a
6
pack
of
these
during
the
summer
its
not
a
mind
blowing
beer
by
any
means
but
is
miles
ahead
of
the
bmc
light
beers
o
decent
malty
beer
would
try
again
nothing
too
special
though
opretty
nice
offering
from
bells
taste
is
full
hinting
at
grains
barley
wheat
and
just
enough
of
a
hop
bite
to
make
this
a
formidable
and
ideal
session
ale
nothing
truly
outstanding
but
overall
quite
an
enjoyable
brew
o
easy
drinker
this
has
too
much
flavor
and
character
to
be
a
blonde
ale
this
probably
closer
to
a
pale
ale
overall
the
beers
traits
all
work
very
well
together
this
is
an
excellent
american
beer
o
light
and
refreshing
o
definitely
enjoyable
great
session
beer
but
not
one
i
would
go
looking
for
very
drinkable
the
sweet
character
i
describe
does
not
make
the
beer
too
sweet
citrus
is
the
taste
with
a
light
bitter
aftertaste
very
tasty
and
a
very
drinkable
fresh
and
crispy
beer
a
great
session
beer
here
not
the
most
complex
flavor
profile
but
still
a
very
well
made
beer
pretty
good
stuff
for
what
it
is
overall
a
very
tasty
and
interesting
brew
it
has
a
surprisingly
high
hop
presence
for
a
lighter
bodied
beer
its
like
a
light
version
of
a
pale
ale
a
good
option
for
summer
when
you
want
an
easy
drinking
beer
with
a
good
hop
presence
this
bottle
was
a
few
weeks
past
its
recommended
date
yet
it
still
tastes
fresh
i
guess
i
havent
had
many
american
blond
ales
this
one
is
light
enough
to
drink
easily
but
the
flavors
arent
great
in
my
opinion
the
first
bells
beer
i
havent
liked
too
much
d
high
light
crisp
and
easy
to
drink
o
i
was
expecting
a
bit
more
from
bells
but
i
suppose
i
shouldnt
have
got
my
hopes
up
for
a
blonde
ale
overall
i
like
this
beer
better
than
the
sum
of
its
parts
dont
think
it
would
be
an
every
day
beer
but
its
a
tasty
change
up
this
is
a
good
session
beer
nice
for
its
style
overallnot
really
want
i
was
hoping
for
i
have
yet
to
try
a
bells
beer
i
havent
liked
until
now
will
not
seek
out
this
beer
again
overall
this
is
a
good
beer
ibus
arent
that
bad
but
it
does
have
that
hoppy
bitterness
to
it
orange
lacy
hazy
beautiful
but
smells
grainy
with
a
bit
of
floral
hopwhat
is
an
american
blonde
ale
im
not
sure
ive
ever
had
one
before
its
basically
reminiscent
of
a
light
european
lager
very
crisp
a
little
bit
sweet
like
a
pear
grainy
enough
citrusfloral
hops
to
stay
interesting
but
overall
soft
and
clean
on
the
palate
its
a
great
lager
and
so
top
points
from
me
but
i
guess
i
expect
more
interest
from
bells
drinkability
pretty
good
its
a
boring
beer
but
inoffensive
this
beer
is
far
different
than
most
in
the
bells
portfolio
but
i
find
it
to
be
quite
tasty
it
is
not
the
best
of
its
kind
but
it
is
an
interesting
take
on
an
easy
drinking
lager
i
will
definitely
consider
picking
this
beer
up
for
a
summer
bbq
very
drinkable
and
easy
to
go
down
taste
is
actually
pretty
decent
a
step
above
any
macro
american
blonde
ale
much
more
dominant
malt
profile
shows
up
backed
by
an
even
tiny
hop
bite
that
makes
for
quite
a
refreshing
beer
still
feel
like
the
flavour
is
lacking
a
bit
from
age
at
this
point
also
a
grainygrass
taste
reminiscent
of
macros
mouthfeel
is
light
to
medium
crisp
and
dry
overall
i
was
a
bit
let
down
by
the
first
two
categories
but
the
taste
made
up
for
it
obviously
quality
ingrediants
are
used
for
this
beer
which
set
it
apart
from
similiarly
styled
mass
produced
bmc
types
decent
beer
with
a
good
sessionable
abv
o
not
a
bad
beer
really
easy
to
get
down
overall
a
good
light
beer
this
is
something
that
i
could
see
myself
sessioning
in
the
right
situation
pours
a
hazy
pale
yellow
a
good
amount
of
head
with
good
retention
smells
light
citrus
and
lemon
a
hint
of
yeast
and
some
slight
hints
of
a
sweet
malt
background
mostly
the
lemon
and
citrus
stand
out
very
light
the
taste
is
subtle
and
not
exciting
lemon
and
yeast
a
tough
of
wheat
well
carbonated
but
a
bit
thin
there
is
some
bite
to
it
that
hurts
the
drinkability
a
bit
simple
enjoyable
beer
thrist
quencher
lawnmover
summer
time
make
it
happen
light
bodied
plenty
of
carbonation
and
has
an
unpleasant
bitter
aftertaste
it
does
not
seem
like
this
fits
any
one
style
very
well
i
dont
care
much
for
this
beer
drinkability
ill
have
another
please
seriously
at
4
8
and
with
how
light
and
refreshing
this
is
a
6er
in
a
night
wouldnt
be
out
of
the
question
at
all
i
wish
i
had
access
to
this
in
the
summer
after
a
fun
day
on
the
river
i
know
its
not
a
favorite
style
because
its
not
huge
but
this
beer
deserves
some
praise
i
found
this
beer
very
drinkablesessonable
and
would
be
great
for
a
hot
summers
day
of
fishinng
moderately
bitter
hop
bite
lagery
feel
though
a
blonde
ale
grainy
grassy
herbal
wet
hay
floral
notes
dry
finish
lightly
bitter
simple
and
clean
the
focus
seems
to
be
on
the
floral
american
hops
drinkable
and
quenching
though
a
bit
simple
and
onenote
lager
of
the
lakes
was
more
enjoyable
to
me
personally
highly
drinkable
great
brew
drinkability
very
easy
beer
all
gone
in
less
than
15
minutes
including
forcing
myself
to
take
breaks
drinkability
a
tasty
thirst
quenching
brew
that
can
be
drunk
all
night
long
a
rather
nice
beer
considering
it
didnt
look
like
much
in
the
glass
notes
i
am
happy
with
this
beer
that
i
have
seen
in
stores
everywhere
around
here
and
finally
purchased
for
purposes
of
drinking
and
rating
it
here
today
d
this
has
good
drinkability
it
is
a
very
easy
going
beer
overall
i
think
this
is
good
but
kind
of
generic
i
could
easily
drink
a
lot
of
these
i
think
this
would
be
a
good
beer
to
have
on
a
nice
hot
day
this
is
a
full
pale
ale
the
taste
is
full
of
pale
malts
the
carbonation
is
upfront
and
builds
crystal
malts
make
an
appearance
and
finishes
with
slight
hop
citrus
and
bitterness
d
very
sessionable
dont
go
out
of
your
way
for
this
beer
but
worth
trying
drinkabilitly
i
was
pleasantly
surprised
by
this
brew
its
really
pretty
good
easily
drinkable
and
would
be
real
nice
on
spring
and
summer
days
ill
give
this
a
second
go
round
no
problem
d
somewhat
sessionable
but
not
something
id
want
more
than
a
pint
of
d
the
beer
is
rather
drinkability
but
the
lack
of
complexity
really
hurt
the
beer
overall
outstanding
session
ale
here
i
would
not
mind
throwing
back
a
half
dozen
of
these
any
day
it
just
really
seems
to
work
quite
nicely
spot
on
d
i
wouldnt
really
call
it
a
truly
quaffable
beer
it
seems
like
a
step
above
generic
bmc
stuff
it
just
feels
watered
down
i
needs
a
little
balancing
palepils
malt
to
sweeten
it
up
just
a
touch
and
give
it
a
little
more
body
not
bad
but
not
something
id
reach
for
again
its
a
very
clean
beer
pretty
drinkable
as
well
it
isnt
going
to
wow
many
people
but
if
this
is
meant
to
be
a
refreshing
beer
particularly
for
hot
weather
id
say
its
a
fine
choice
o
versatile
but
not
overly
interesting
pours
a
pale
honey
color
with
a
two
finger
white
head
and
a
bit
of
lacing
nose
consists
of
slightly
sweet
dough
and
hints
of
light
floral
and
citrus
notes
taste
is
the
same
with
a
grain
and
bread
interplay
somewhat
grassy
mouthfeel
is
nice
with
good
carbonation
and
a
heavy
enough
body
drinks
fairly
well
and
would
be
a
solid
introductory
beer
this
is
why
i
like
mixed
sixers
it
pours
a
clear
lemonade
with
a
bunch
o
particulate
matter
floatin
about
in
there
a
nice
finger
of
steadfast
white
froth
sits
on
top
the
nose
comprises
lemon
zest
mandarin
orange
flesh
flowers
and
a
tiny
hint
o
funky
sour
the
taste
is
similar
though
the
lemon
brings
some
of
its
rind
along
for
the
ride
creating
some
extra
bitterness
toward
the
end
the
body
is
light
with
a
light
carbonation
and
a
rather
smooth
feel
overall
an
okay
brew
but
nothing
i
would
necessarily
aim
at
getting
again
i
poured
into
a
pint
glass
to
an
inch
of
white
head
that
was
gone
in
no
time
this
beer
is
yellow
in
color
and
has
suspended
yeast
particles
in
it
the
aroma
is
sweet
bready
malt
the
taste
is
sweet
malt
and
is
replaced
by
a
metallic
bitterness
it
reminds
me
of
a
european
beer
the
mouthfeel
is
medium
and
has
a
slight
grittiness
to
it
this
is
not
my
favorite
style
so
the
drinkability
will
take
a
hit
mfd
quite
carbonated
and
easy
to
drink
the
only
problem
is
that
one
could
do
it
for
a
lot
cheaper
with
a
big
block
of
pbr
drinkability
i
view
this
as
an
all
around
good
beer
but
i
cant
see
myself
having
more
than
one
in
a
sitting
by
itself
this
is
really
a
beer
to
have
with
a
meal
that
crispness
and
bitter
finish
suggests
something
best
paired
with
a
meal
i
dont
know
what
yet
but
something
to
counteract
another
strong
flavor
fish
maybe
again
good
beer
but
even
with
its
nice
abv
i
cant
see
this
as
sessionable
for
me
anyway
on
the
whole
this
almost
seems
like
a
light
ipa
to
me
batch
9722
i
dont
know
what
to
tell
you
something
about
this
beer
is
amiss
clear
golden
color
with
what
i
thought
was
carbonation
bubbles
but
5
min
or
so
later
and
it
was
just
suspended
floaties
is
this
beer
bottle
conditioned
a
golden
beer
brewed
with
pale
malts
large
american
hop
additions
contribute
a
crisp
refreshing
bitterness
a
tribute
to
the
great
lakes
t
c
b
is
a
truly
quaffable
beer
or
so
the
brewery
says
im
not
so
sure
maybe
i
got
a
bad
bottle
bells
is
1
of
my
top
5
breweries
in
america
this
is
not
what
i
see
in
the
reviews
or
the
beer
i
will
try
again
another
time
and
review
d
great
bbqlawnmower
beer
exactly
what
i
look
for
on
a
hot
day
touch
too
expensive
wont
necessarily
keep
it
stocked
at
all
times
but
a
nice
treat
d
easy
beer
to
drink
would
be
nice
to
have
a
few
but
the
price
is
a
little
high
in
my
opinion
extra
points
for
having
one
of
the
most
original
labels
in
michigan
pleasant
easy
drinking
beer
nothing
extraordinary
but
a
good
solid
brew
d
even
with
the
metal
taste
its
a
decent
drinker
the
taste
is
better
the
american
hops
bring
a
nice
drying
bitterness
forth
piney
and
an
unsuprising
touch
of
yeast
being
that
its
floating
around
everywhere
like
fish
food
in
the
glass
a
little
heavy
on
the
carbonation
but
it
makes
for
a
solid
bbq
beer
poured
into
a
pint
glass
left
a
half
finger
white
head
with
minimal
lacing
lots
of
suspended
yeast
sediment
which
i
like
beautiful
floral
scent
with
lots
of
american
hops
very
crisp
and
bitter
taste
little
biscuit
in
the
malt
this
makes
me
think
of
an
american
esb
very
nice
and
drinkable
i
may
try
to
brew
something
like
this
drinkability
easy
to
drink
but
at
10
a
6er
ugh
half
a
point
extra
for
the
awesome
label
drinkability
light
easy
drinking
but
not
really
worth
returning
to
especially
because
of
the
lingering
aftertaste
a
light
snappy
beer
id
recommend
it
wholeheartedly
over
anything
from
a
major
brewery
any
day
pours
a
light
yellow
not
too
translucent
though
head
was
white
and
fluffy
armoa
had
a
mix
of
lightly
sweet
malts
taste
was
slightly
sweet
and
grainy
bitterness
of
the
hops
was
there
as
well
not
too
thick
or
thin
decent
beer
that
i
had
with
my
salmon
burger
t
doverall
refreshing
crisp
and
light
being
that
bells
is
popping
up
in
grocery
stores
and
gas
stations
more
and
more
id
definitely
pick
this
up
over
most
other
brews
youd
find
in
those
locations
id
pass
this
up
while
at
a
specialty
store
however
very
drinkable
third
coast
beer
will
become
a
regular
in
my
fridge
and
i
will
attempt
to
convert
my
bmc
friends
with
this
tcb
should
get
more
love
quite
surprised
that
there
was
only
240
reviews
overall
this
is
a
good
brew
light
and
refreshing
unoffensive
flavors
and
nice
low
abv
great
session
brew
f
finishes
pretty
dry
and
semi
bitter
almost
like
raping
my
tongue
with
it
some
fruity
flavors
seems
to
stick
to
the
sides
of
my
mouth
and
keep
some
juicy
flavors
coming
it
has
quite
a
bit
of
bitterness
but
lacks
much
hop
flavor
but
its
called
a
blonde
ale
and
not
a
pale
so
i
guess
it
doesnt
need
much
for
hop
flavors
but
also
might
be
a
little
to
pale
imo
its
still
a
nice
beer
though
a
good
lagerish
beer
i
enjoyed
the
salty
taste
the
3rd
coast
beer
pours
a
golden
straw
color
with
a
minimal
1
finger
head
lots
of
sediment
slowly
settles
to
the
bottom
of
the
glass
smell
is
sweet
and
citrusy
hints
of
lemons
limes
and
grassy
field
greens
taste
is
not
nearly
as
sweet
as
the
nose
but
has
a
nice
bitter
hoppy
finish
mouthfeel
is
thin
and
crisp
drinkability
is
pretty
high
low
abv
and
refreshing
on
a
warm
day
a
surprising
amount
of
flavor
in
this
blonde
ale
malt
is
full
of
grainy
biscuit
charater
floral
hops
have
a
solid
presence
and
the
peppery
yeasty
quality
was
completely
unexpected
drinkability
even
with
its
lively
effervescence
it
displays
a
substantial
body
that
a
lager
of
comparable
composition
never
could
all
in
all
a
pleasant
easily
drinkable
light
ale
though
the
closest
ive
been
to
the
third
coast
is
a
trip
up
or
two
to
up
to
three
floyds
for
dark
lord
day
poured
in
a
sam
adams
perfect
pint
appearance
is
a
cloudy
haze
with
some
debris
floating
around
smells
a
little
hoppy
and
yeasty
taste
some
pleasent
bitterness
from
the
hopiness
light
bodied
feel
grity
could
drink
a
few
more
of
these
but
not
likly
this
beer
pours
a
pale
yellow
color
wtih
a
finger
of
head
that
falls
to
coat
the
beer
the
nose
is
nice
with
a
spicey
slightly
sweet
hop
over
a
semiorange
seet
malt
the
flavor
is
nice
as
well
the
hop
is
not
something
i
can
place
but
i
really
like
the
crisp
spiceyness
it
brings
there
is
a
slight
orangey
sweetness
i
like
it
the
feel
is
moderate
with
a
lively
carbonation
this
is
a
very
exciting
i
really
really
do
like
it
bells
lives
up
to
their
reputation
with
this
brew
im
looking
forward
to
checking
out
the
rest
of
this
case
now
a
step
above
the
bmcs
but
not
by
much
poured
a
clear
golden
yellow
with
little
head
or
lacing
a
nose
that
was
slightly
grainyslightly
fruity
and
a
thin
body
taste
was
slightly
fruit
but
mostly
bland
finish
slightly
on
the
watery
side
not
much
of
an
offering
from
bells
mfd
quite
carbonated
and
easy
to
drink
the
only
problem
is
that
one
could
do
it
for
a
lot
cheaper
with
a
big
block
of
pbr
d
seems
like
a
good
beer
for
summer
perhaps
a
little
too
bitter
drinkability
fantastic
body
and
drinkability
were
both
typical
for
the
style
there
are
times
when
a
nice
smooth
quaffable
blonde
is
the
beer
youre
in
the
mood
for
and
this
would
be
a
good
choice
if
it
were
regularly
available
to
me
it
would
be
in
my
regular
rotation
worth
trying
and
worth
having
a
friend
bring
back
from
vacation
d
easy
peasy
this
beer
pours
a
deep
straw
yellow
with
ample
amount
of
sediment
floating
around
in
this
brew
a
one
finger
of
bubbly
white
head
caps
the
beer
receding
rapidly
leaving
no
lacing
to
speak
of
nose
is
mostly
of
grains
and
malt
with
only
a
hint
of
floral
hops
to
it
taste
is
grainy
up
front
with
touch
of
breadiness
and
malt
in
the
middle
and
the
finish
is
of
grassy
and
floral
hops
light
to
medium
body
medium
carbonation
very
crisp
and
smooth
goes
down
easily
this
is
a
highly
sessionable
beer
overall
a
very
light
beer
i
could
easily
drink
a
few
of
these
in
a
sitting
nothing
i
would
go
out
of
my
way
for
as
it
just
doesnt
have
to
much
flavor
going
on
not
bad
for
a
summer
day
d
not
for
me
but
i
could
see
some
liking
this
as
a
good
session
beer
not
bad
for
the
style
i
think
most
here
are
voting
against
the
style
rather
than
the
beer
pours
a
hazy
golden
with
a
thin
white
head
aromas
of
bitter
earthy
piney
hops
and
lager
yeast
dont
get
me
wrong
the
hops
are
relatively
light
but
far
more
noticeable
than
usual
for
the
style
similar
as
the
far
as
the
taste
goes
a
quick
hit
of
bitter
hops
refreshing
then
a
slightly
stale
taste
of
lager
yeast
takes
over
crisp
but
a
bit
too
strong
on
the
yeast
front
it
kinda
lingers
in
the
mouth
d
easy
to
drink
but
not
all
that
appealing
to
kick
back
with
either
considering
the
gamut
of
better
beers
to
do
so
taste
reflects
the
nose
semidry
crisp
and
refreshing
mouth
carbonation
is
average
with
light
sweetness
on
the
finish
this
is
a
simple
beer
with
a
nice
crisp
character
mild
and
enjoyable
d
light
body
makes
it
an
easy
drink
but
i
would
tend
to
reach
for
others
probably
not
a
bad
brew
at
all
just
not
mindblowing
for
the
style
however
its
got
more
flavor
than
most
this
is
a
good
unfiltered
brew
with
pretty
solid
flavor
though
some
may
find
it
to
be
both
uncomplicated
and
a
bit
light
i
enjoyed
it
well
enough
cheers
pours
a
weak
goldengreen
clear
with
hundreds
of
unidentified
particles
floating
all
around
moderate
white

mostly
diminishes
aroma
of
corn
grain
adjunct
smell
that
is
unappealing
do
i
have
the
high
life
with
floating
pebbles
natural
light
the
beast
aroma
is
no
appealing
whatsoever
taste
bitter
and
not
as
bad
as
the
aroma
but
still
nothing
pleasant
pale
grains
slight
lemon
taste
just
not
what
i
expect
from
bells
i
really
really
tried
to
be
an
advocate
on
this
one
giving
it
a
2nd
pour
but
just
cannot
rate
this
any
higher
thin
pure
white
head
barely
lasts
a
few
seconds
before
dissolving
into
islands
across
the
surface
no
lacing
at
all
hazy
enough
to
induce
a
decent
translucency
to
the
orangeyellow
color
this
haze
prevents
much
hue
loss
at
the
rims
orange
and
lemon
citrus
break
into
your
nostrils
first
bready
in
a
semiuncooked
manner
somewhat
earthy
more
so
than
floral
not
many
fruit
scents
nor
malt
sweetness
overall
just
trails
off
on
you
as
if
in
midsentence
mediumbodied
holds
its
weight
consistently
throughout
and
the
carbonation
plays
an
able
supporting
role
theres
some
sort
of
pickled
or
saline
bitterness
to
it
doesnt
seem
directly
attributable
to
the
grass
straw
sourdough
bread
flavors
no
malt
rescue
unit
on
the
scene
the
citrus
element
is
mixed
and
without
a
clear
character
comes
across
as
beer
albeit
crafted
beer
wish
the
whole
was
more
than
the
sum
of
the
parts
the
first
and
hopefully
only
bells

such
low
abv
and
the
flavor
profile
is
simple
but
pleasing
not
a
bad
beer
at
all
bells
third
coast
beer
is
an
okay
beer
i
was
almost
certain
that
id
reviewed
this
beer
before
but
found
that
i
had
confused
it
with
third
coast
old
ale
thats
a
different
animal
i
prefer
third
coast
old
ale
third
coast
beer
is
merely
above
average
perhaps
this
is
a
style
for
which
its
tough
to
create
a
standout
that
might
be
the
case
here
ill
have
to
explore
the
style
more
to
have
a
more
informed
opinion
as
it
is
third
coast
beer
is
okay
not
a
great
deal
better
than
that
d
definitely
a
drinkable
beer
but
ive
had
better
from
bells
nonetheless
i
could
see
drinking
this
in
the
heart
of
summer
while
grilling
outside
d
this
is
a
very
offcentered
brew
that
seems
too
strange
to
really
enjoy
not
bad
by
any
means
but
id
pass
on
a
second
one
a
nice
beer
but
not
terribly
interesting
the
beer
is
a
hazy
pale
golden
color
with
an
okay
head
quick
edit
the
beer
is
apparently
bottleconditioned
and
once
the
yeast
settles
out
it
seems
to
clear
up
some
unsurprisingly
the
nose
doesnt
exactly
blow
me
away
but
theres
nothing
offensive
about
it
and
i
can
imagine
a
bit
more
hop
aroma
from
a
very
fresh
bottle
not
that
this
one
is
old
the
nose
has
a
bit
of
spicy
earthy
mineral
hops
against
a
backdrop
of
pale
malt
the
flavor
is
similar
with
a
bit
of
grassiness
coming
in
and
touches
of
lemon
and
corn
the
whole
thing
seems
like
a
european
lager
i
recently
had
a
nice
german
pilsener
and
third
coast
beer
is
bringing
that
back
to
mind
readily
i
would
love
to
try
this
beer
on
tap
at
the
brewery
or
within
a
few
weeks
of
bottling
because
the
flavors
on
these
light
fresh
beers
can
be
fickle
a
big
thanks
to
deliriumfest
for
the
trade
d
a
very
easy
beer
to
drink
which
makes
this
beer
a
decent
session
beer
the
beer
is
pretty
clear
with
a
slight
bit
of
cloudiness
looks
good
with
its
one
inch
fluffy
head
the
pale
straw
colour
makes
the
beer
look
like
its
a
pilsner
of
some
sort
the
nose
smells
of
malt
but
you
really
have
to
strain
to
smell
them
the
flavour
is
mostly
maltiness
but
really
smooth
there
is
a
bitterness
to
the
beer
but
its
quite
subdued
the
hops
come
through
at
the
end
and
they
are
slightly
grassy
there
is
a
sweetness
in
the
beer
that
comes
through
after
the
beer
warms
up
which
gives
it
a
pleasant
aftertaste
the
mouth
feel
is
quite
light
but
this
helps
the
drinkability
the
drinkability
is
what
youd
except
for
this
beer
another
great
beer
from
bells
very
pleasant
overall
if
you
enjoy
a
light
bitter
beer
to
sip
personally
i
find
it
a
bit
too
subdued
it
reminds
of
how
awesome
a
fullon
tripel
could
be
without
quite
going
there
itself
dok
a
fine
sesion
beer
but
relatively
normal
but
regardless
of
its
normal
flavor
its
a
wellmade
beer
and
quite
appealing
this
was
quite
a
surprise
from
the
opening
aroma
blast
to
the
final
sipnot
because
it
was
delicious
but
rather
because
this
was
one
beer
that
one
could
not
judge
by
its
cover
so
to
speak
delicious
subtly
complex
and
one
that
has
a
fixed
position
on
my
beer
radar
thank
goodness
bells
in
back
in
central
illinois
third
coast
is
very
good
stuff
taste
floral
pale
malts
fair
bit
of
spiciness
and
hop
bitterness
in
the
finish
bitter
citrus
rind
flavor
stays
on
the
palate
for
quite
a
while
pours
a
clear
pale
yellow
there
is
a
lot
of
suspended
yeast
14
inch
head
with
slight
lacing
and
slight
retention
smells
of
hops
sweet
malt
and
some
slight
fruit
fits
the
style
of
an
american
blodne
ale
there
is
a
smooth
and
crisp
mouth
feel
with
a
high
carbonation
level
tastes
strongly
of
hops
sweet
malt
background
slight
fruit
and
an
associated
dryness
of
the
palate
i
enjoyed
this
one
more
than
i
expected
since
i
am
not
a
fan
of
this
style
of
beer
d
perhaps
not
the
most
drinkable
beer
one
is
filling
and
two
is
a
meal
and
the
flavor
is
a
bit
heady
i
would
definitely
buy
this
again
but
get
something
a
bit
smoother
too
not
a
bad
beer
though
i
think
reissdorf
has
the
edge
as
it
comes
out
a
bit
smoother
in
the
end
this
one
looks
a
little
better
and
has
some
healthier
looking
lacing
but
then
again
looks
arent
everything
d
i
guess
im
usually
not
a
fan
of
blonde
ales
for
a
blonde
though
it
is
slightly
below
average
for
what
ive
had
went
okay
however
with
indian
food
poured
into
pint
glass
pours
deep
golden
with
a
half
finger
of
head
smells
citrus
lemony
taste
is
smooth
a
little
bitter
but
hop
bitter
not
sour
good
mouthfeel
very
drinkable
my
first
bells
beer
and
although
im
not
a
huge
fan
of
this
style
a
solid
example
this
beer
has
a
nice
bronze
color
with
a
gold
hue
there
is
some
sediment
to
the
body
but
it
is
not
too
bad
it
has
a
golden
white
head
and
lace
there
is
plenty
of
frothy
uneven
head
and
a
lot
of
lace
it
has
a
hoppy
citric
aroma
the
taste
is
also
well
hopped
and
citric
with
some
fruit
like
sweetness
the
aftertaste
is
a
little
sour
but
mainly
cereal
and
grainy
the
mouthfeel
is
fizzy
and
slick
overall
it
is
a
different
beer
but
good
pour
is
a
nice
light
golden
colorwith
a
serious
white
head
aroma
of
citrus
and
floral
hops
with
a
touch
of
spice
light
bodied
smooth
malt
backgroundwith
a
lemony
hop
sort
of
finish
very
easy
mouthfeellike
you
could
dirnk
many
of
these
today
i
thought
this
offering
to
be
quite
good
thank
you
mr
bell
the
taste
matches
up
pretty
well
much
more
interesting
than
i
would
expect
out
of
a
blonde
ale
nicely
balanced
too
definitely
more
of
a
summer
beer
but
not
bad
here
in
the
middle
of
december
either
with
it
being
about
20
degrees
tonight
i
cant
help
feeling
this
would
be
much
better
in
the
summertime
pretty
decent
flavor
overall
and
better
than
i
was
expecting
actually
had
a
pretty
nice
hop
bite
to
it
overall
i
think
this
falls
somewhere
between
a
mild
blonde
ale
and
an
aggressive
ipa
but
its
pretty
solid
regardless
id
definitely
kick
back
with
some
bbq
and
a
couple
of
these
this
beer
has
a
great
texture
rich
unattenuated
but
not
oily
full
feel
i
could
drink
this
all
day
and
at
4
8
abv
i
just
might
d
it
is
a
bit
too
bitter
without
enough
blasting
citrus
hops
for
me
a
good
beer
but
not
the
best
in
bells
catalog
this
one
poured
a
cloudy
golden
with
almost
no
head
it
had
quite
a
bit
of
yeast
in
suspensin
it
smells
mainly
malty
but
there
are
some
hops
in
here
the
taste
is
pretty
goodcrisp
mediumbodied
with
some
solid
flavor
some
bitter
hops
at
the
end
provide
a
good
finish
i
say
this
is
another
solid
brew
by
bells
d
low
alcohol
makes
this
fairly
drinkable
on
one
hand
but
the
bitterness
combined
with
the
higher
carbonation
make
it
tough
to
drink
a
lot
on
the
other
d
decent
session
beer
clean
refreshing
and
eminently
drinkable
d
i
drink
bells
other
brands
pretty
frequently
and
i
think
this
wouldnt
make
many
peoples
regular
rotation
for
a
quality
craft
brew
its
very
drinkable
and
tasty
but
not
distinctive
d
the
ale
is
approachable
loaded
with
hops
but
with
a
pleasant
edge
i
could
spend
my
day
at
the
beach
drinking
this
pours
a
goldish
yellow
color
with
a
white
head
in
the
aroma
small
grapefruity
hop
and
a
grainy
malt
in
the
taste
buscuity
malt
and
small
grapefruity
hops
a
small
bitter
and
medium
mouthfeel
and
a
dry
small
hop
aftertaste
nice
balance
kind
of
standard
pale
with
a
touch
bigger
hops
a
bit
too
strong
for
a
blonde
ale
drinkabilty
is
difficult
and
its
also
possible
that
this
beer
was
miscategorized
it
tastes
more
like
a
base
ipa
than
a
blonde
ale
its
not
bad
but
i
wouldnt
even
classify
it
as
a
blonde
ale
d
this
was
okay
it
had
a
weird
balance
that
didnt
seem
to
work
very
well
it
definitely
got
better
as
it
warmed
though
third
coast
beer
aint
bad
but
seems
to
have
a
bit
too
much
peppery
spiciness
for
my
enjoyment
wouldnt
mind
trying
it
again
but
there
are
many
other
beers
higher
on
that
list
d
really
nothing
special
here
glad
i
went
for
the
single
bottle
and
not
any
more
as
i
doubt
id
want
to
try
it
again
overall
impression
a
straight
forward
balanced
approachable
blonde
ale
good
crossover
beer
dcertainly
goes
down
smooth
and
easy
low
abv
this
is
a
summer
refresher
but
id
advise
you
to
come
thirsty
and
drink
it
cold
light
mouthfeel
probably
leaning
toward
medium
giving
the
crowd
it
runs
with
in
the
blonde
ale
style
very
clean
drinkable
and
hopdriven
take
on
a
classically
summer
style
i
liked
this
beer
and
think
it
would
be
a
good
session
beer
but
probably
only
for
one
session
for
bells
its
not
nearly
enough
of
a
standout
this
rather
is
the
lowestkey
of
any
of
bells
offerings
and
i
suspect
that
is
why
its
ratings
are
low
a
solid
easy
to
drink
beerall
the
terminology
used
for
domestic
macros
but
for
real
worth
trying
d
fairly
easy
to
drink
just
not
a
lot
going
on
here
12oz
bottle
pours
a
light
golden
orange
color
with
a
solid
looking
head
the
aroma
is
sweet

with
some
spices
hints
of
citrus
and
spicy

very
nice
and
interesting

the
taste
is

surprisingly
amount
of
spicy

in
the
finish
overall
bells
third
coast
is
another
solid
beer
from
bells
that
i
wish
was
distributed
down
here
with
most
of
the
other
bells
brews
that
are
available
recommended
golden
mildly
aromatic
slightly
tart
with
notes
of
vanilla
orange
creamsicle
lemon
and
pilsner
malts
when
i
was
drinking
this
i
wasnt
sure
if
this
was
a
lager
or
an
ale
the
malts
are
grainy
unexciting
and
have
notes
of
corn
and
butter
the
hops
are
herbal
and
earthy
with
notes

but
with
a
packed

punch
in
the
finish
this
is
on
the
edge
of
a
pale
ale
style
i
think
a
bit
too
sharp
and
tangy
for
a
blonde
ale
but
nevertheless
a
tasty
treat
if
youre
into
the
hop
ride
dhas
more
hoppy
character
than
the

description
would
indicate
but
i
really
enjoyed
this
one
very
drinkable
i
love
bells
but
this
is
not
one
of
their
best
it
is
like
a
lager
w
ale
hoppiness
however
they
just
didnt
blend
well
it
is
light
like
i
wanted
but
not
very
drinkable
due
to
the
harsh
hops
and
skunkiness
maybe
i
got
a
bad
batch
couldnt
test
the
date
as
the
website
was
down
but
this
is
my
4th
beer
from
the
six
pack
and
they
have
all
been
consistently
dull
i
dont
think
ill
pick
this
up
again
however
i
would
like
to
try
it
on
tap
to
see
if
the
experience
differs
d
i
dont
really
know
what
to
say
this
makes
a
great
warm
weather
beer
and
would
be
a
kick
ass
session
brew
drinkabliity
is
decent
if
the
brew
was
a
bit
sweeter
and
had
a
bit
less
co2
in
it
this
could
be
a
solid
brew
but
it
falls
short
in
a
few
areas
drinkability
a
bit
hoppy
for
a

but
at
4
8
a
sessionable
brew
this
beer
pours
cloudy
blonde
color
with
a
lot
of
visible
yeast
floating
around
the
aroma
has
some
mild
caramel
notes
but
is
mostly
of
sweet
bread
the
taste
is
of
pine
resin
with
a
lingering
bitterness
in
the
finish
the
hop
profile
is
firm
without
being
overpowering
this
is
a
very
bitter
beer
for
a
blonde
ale
the
mouthfeel
is
mediumlight
bodied
with
lively
carbonation
overall
this
is
a
very
nice
blone
ale
it
has
character
which
is
something
most
blondes
lack
im
not
a
huge
fan
of
this
style
but
i
can
surely
see
myself
drinking
this
beer
again
on
a
hot
summer
day
a

with

a
good
summer
beer
drinks
pretty
easy
blonde
with
a
tinge
of
wit
to
it
thanks
to
muenchnerkindl
for
the
sample
very
easy
to
drink
could
down
a
six
of
these
easily
dthis
is
a
very
easy
drinking
beergood
for
a
game
or
twogood
session
beer
d
i
rate
this
slightly
above
average
only
because
the
hops
do
make
it
interesting
it
is
low
enough
abv
to
session
and
would
be
better
than
your
average
american
lager
for
that
purpose
but
i
am
not
sure
i
would
seek
it
out
just
to
have
one
though
maybe
it
would
be
good
on
a
hot
day
after
being
outside
for
awhile
overall
its
a
really
nice
beer
on
the
lighter
end
of
the
spectrum
kind
of
pale
hazy
and
yellowy
nice
dense
white
head
no
huge
presence
of
aromas
maybe
some
hoppy
characteristics
the
flavor
indicates
more
of
a
presence
of
hops
its
got
the
bitter
ale
flavor
with
a
minute
amount
of
citrus
not
too
overpowering
but
then
again
its
not
an
ipa
pretty
smooth
and
easy
to
drink
d
this
beer
is
ok
it
has
a
descent
amount
of
hops
it
doesnt
really
stand
out
as
anything
special
i
think
this
beer
is
very
drinkable
and
satisfies
a
number
of
different
personal
cravings
due
to
its
complexity
the
carbonation
overall
taste
and
particularly
the
aftertaste
are
very
palatable
in
my
opinion
d
a
sessionable
brew
thanks
to
a
light
flavor
and
mouthfeel
its
enjoyable
but
nothing
special
bells
has
set
the
bar
pretty
damn
high
this
beer
is
one
of
their
weaker
offerings
d
pretty
good
taste
profile
is
a
bit
odd
but
it
is
quite
drinkable
sessionable
and
definitely
worth
a
try
but
this
is
probably
my
least
favorite
offering
from
bells
the
drinkability
is
good
not
a
great
style
but
a
fine
brew
for
it
mk
cloudy
gold
with
a
one
inch
head
plenty
of
visible
carbonation
and
good
retention
and
lacing
aroma
is
not
interesting
smells
like
american
hops
i
dont
have
the
ability
to
detect
microaromas
so
i
asked
my
bloodhound
wife
she
said
all
she
smells
is
hops
it
has
an
interesting
bitter
flavor
and
good
mouthfeel
with
plenty
of
carbonation
another
reviewer
referred
to
light
prickly
carbonation
that
describes
it
perfectly
i
enjoyed
this
beer
and
would
drink
it
again
d
not
a
style
that
really
wows
me
but
was
a
good
brew
nonetheless
easily
drinkable
thanks
to
kryptic
for
the
taste
pours
a
light
golden
color
with
light
carbonation
and
a
thin
lace
of
head
the
bottle
had
some
floaties
in
it
also
smell
is
sweet
with
some
fruitiness
to
it
taste
is
almost
identical
to
the
flavor
just
a
light
more
pronounced
mouthfeel
is
smooth
but
has
a
bitterness
that
seems
to
linger
in
the
back
of
the
throat
normally
i
dont
care
for
bitter
aftertaste
but
being
a
blonde
ale
its
quite
pleasing
this
is
the
first
time
reviewing
this
beer
but
second
time
having
it
if
it
wasnt
for
the
floaties
this
would
be
an
excellent
beer
all
around
this
still
is
an
good
beer
that
is
one
of
the
better
blonde
ales
ive
had
batch
8106
light
orange
hue
with
a
thin
white
head
that
disappaited
leaving
a
faint
ring
very
lazy
carbonation
not
quite
clear
more
hazy
transluscent
smells
of
tangerine
pomegranite
hops
lively
hopped
taste
and
mouthfeel
thin
body
some
sharpness
in
the
finish
a
swirl
produces
some
fizziness
and
the
modest
ring
and
lacing
persists
aftertaste
is
bitter
and
dry
overall
quite
enjoyable
like
all
bells
products
that
ive
sampled
recently
what
a
great
session
beer
i
havent
figured
out
whether
they
use
ale
or
lager
yeast
for
this
one
but
it
definately
has
a
clean
finish
the
hop
aroma
and
flavor
are
right
on
for
this
style
did
i
detect
a
bit
of
munich
malt
anyhow
this
is
a
highly
drinkable
and
straightforward
brew
drinkability
i
wouldnt
turn
one
down
but
there
are
many
other
american
blondes
that
i
would
prefer
there
is
not
much
taste
up
front
get
the
hop
bitterness
after
swallowing
not
too
impressive
it
is
light
bodied
like
you
would
expect
and
carbonated
very
well
drinkability
very
refreshing
very
drinkable
good
beer
for
the
summer
ive
seen
third
coast
beer
any
number
of
times
during
trips
back
to
ohio
but
it
has
always
been
past
its
prime
that
is
old
third
coast
ale
not
third
coast
old
ale
this
time
i
got
lucky
and
found
a
relatively
fresh
bottle
why
doesnt
this
stuff
get
more

a
b
drinkability
reading
through
the
reviews
it
appears
that
there
has
been
some
style
drift
clearly
not
an
apa
and
a
blonde
ale
might
be
accurate
but
this
could
be
a
lager
too
whatever
it
is
it
is
just
not
my
style
eric
drank
from
a
12

bottle
from

number

pours
a
slightly
cloudy
yellow
with
a
tall
white
head
nice
light
flavors
and
smells
of
the
hops
a
little
leafy
and
grassy
light
crisp
mouthfeel
overall
a
nice
clean
pale
ale
perfect
to
drink
cold
on
a
summer
evening
another
great
offering
from
bells
standard
apa
just
not
very
interesting
a
very
easytodrink
pale
ale
from
bells
its
good
but
not
great
i
did
not
know
anything
about
this
beer
going
in
i
actually
thought
it
was
a
lager
before
the
pour
the
taste
and
the
haziness
and
particles
in
the
glass
i
think
this
mostly
reminds
me
of
an
unfiltered
victory
prima
pils
and
since
prima
pils
is
one
of
my
most
favorite
beers
i
really
enjoyed
this
beer
overall
a
pleasant
pale
ale
offering
from
bells
more
on
the
refreshing
side
i
must
say
that
i
am
a
bit
let
down
by
this
offering
i
didnt
really
know
what
to
expect
out
of
it
as
i
hadnt
previously
read
any
reviews
it
is
light
refreshing
and
very
sessionable
but
those
are
pretty
much
its
only
highlights
definitely
not
the
best
beer
from
bells
and
one
i
wont
try
again
unless
its
given
to
me
d
is
average
because
of
the
carbonation
mouthfeel
and
drinkability
light
bodied
with
high
carbonation
sums
up
the
body
of
this
brew
tends
to
finish
dry
this
brew
is
easy
to
drink
and
could
be
something
one
could
drink
all
night
this
one
is
soso
nothing
to
brag
about
bottle
before
pouring
it
out
extra
flavor
you
know
i
do
wonder
what
a
fresh
one
is
like
though
easy
to
drink
pleasant
yet
unremarkable
beer
well
balanced
simple
and
easy
to
drink
not
as
crisp
as
i
would
like
but
good
pours
a
straw
yellow
color
just
a
slight
shade
of
haze
with
a
puffy
rocky
white
head
smells
a
tad
sulphury
and
very
floral
the
website
claims
they
add
generous
portions
of
american
hops
but
im
definitely
smelling
some
nice
noble
hops
here
the
first
sip
is
cracking
crisp
and
very
dry
floral
its
grainy
with
lots
of
hops
tastes
like
a
lublin
hops
sandwich
on
hearty
white
bread
strong
flavors
of
lager
yeast
and
coarse
grain
medium
bodied
this
one
could
easily
be
replaced
with
bells
lager
of
the
lakes
beer
my
first
dissapointment
with
a
bells
brew
and
it
was
nothing
like
it
i
enjoyed
it
very
much

its
to
be
noted
that
the

michelob
doesnt

the
taste

are

nothing

overall
nothing
more
than
a
thirst
quencher
good
for
a

day
when
abinbev
products
are
the
only

on

the

is
of

and

with
lightly
toasted
malts
as
well
the
taste
is
a
delicious
mix
of
malt
breadiness
and
strong
citrus
making
one
almost
think
it
was
flavored
with
juice
which
it
is
not

at

sip
the
mouthfeel
is

medium
and

finishes
refreshing
crisp
and
dry
overall
this
is
a
very
enjoyable
beer
and
i
would
like
to
have
it
again
im
actually
glad
i
didnt
know
it
was
ab
or
i
might
not
have
tried
it
ill
try
it
again
if
its
the
only
thing
available
this
was
a
pretty
good
beer
it
is
nothing
special
but
is
averagely
good
i
got
it
on
tap
which
came
out
as
a
light
golden
yellow
color
not
fairly
impressive
the
taste
was
satisfactory
with
no
real
overbearing
tastes
to
it
it
has
no
bite
and
no
bad
aftertaste
if
you
want
an
average
beer
that
will
not
disappoint
you
i
recommend
this
overall
not
a
bad
brew
but
not
very
interesting
or
intriguing
overall
extremely
refreshing
if
a
bit
more
watery
than
the
aroma
lead
me
to
anticipate
still
this
brew
offers
a
much
more
interesting
aroma
and
flavor
profile
than
an
american
lager
a
fantastic
addition
to
my
lawnmower
beer
list
if
only
it
were
available
in
cans
for
days
at
the
poolbeach
feels
crisp
and
clean
as
well
as
wetting
to
the
palate
had
this
at
the
copperhead
bar
grille
in
allentown
i
wanted
to
try
something
i
hadnt
had
before
this
was
the
only
choice
at
the
time
so
i
got
this
beer
in
a
pint
glass
can
out
with
a
nice
little
head
on
it
and
a
little
bit
of
a
hazy
yellow
color
this
beers
aroma
was
pretty
hoppy
for
a
blond
ale
the
flavor
was
pretty
crisp
and
nicely
hopped
i
found
it
to
be
pretty
good
i
dont
know
if
id
need
to
have
it
again
i
would
if
i
had
too
im
surprised
that
ab
produced
such
a
quality
brew
definitely
doesnt
taste
like
a
beer
from
the
brewery
famous
for
the
macrobrewed
bud
and
bud
lite
the
bottle
says
the
beer
is
dry
hopped
but
you
really
cant
tell
from
the
aroma
and
flavor
taste
like
caramel
and
butterscotch
its
got
a
bit
of
sharpness
to
it
that
i
like
light
bodied
summer
beer
that
ill
probably
turn
down
i
try
to
always
look
beyond
the
label
and
just
drink
the
beer
very
drinkable
with
no
trace
of
alcohol
it
wont
replace
shock
top
as
my
favorite
ab
product
but
this
is
not
bad
that
said
its
pretty
easy
to
drink
and
tastes
better
than
most
offerings
out
of
anheuserbusch
the
beer
pours
a
clear
golden
color
with
a
white
head
the
aroma
is
orange
citrus
with
some
biscuit
malt
somewhat
surprisingly
the
beer
doesnt
smell
bad
at
all
the
flavor
is
not
as
good
as
the
smell
while
i
get
a
little
bit
of
biscuit
malt
as
well
as
some
orange
and
pine
notes
the
overall
flavor
is
very
faint
the
beer
is
very
watery
and
has
medium
carbonation
there
is
just
really
not
much
too
this
beer
not
one
to
seek
out
i
wouldnt
seek
this
out
but
i
feel
this
is
better
than
some
that
were
in
my
mixed
summer
6
pack
d
this
wasnt
the
best
blonde
i
have
had
by
any
means
but
at
the
local
pub
on
a
warm
day
you
have
one
or
two
of
these
with
their
famous
muffietta
sandwich
which
as
a
relish
topping
and
it
really
gives
the
sandwich
a
good
flavor
atmosphere
is
pretty
decent
nice
appearance
dark
golden
with
a
nice
foamy
head
and
a
little
bit
of
lace
nose
is
not
strong
but
does
have
a
solid
balance
flavor
is
pretty
decent
nothing
transcendental
but
a
nicely
balanced
lightbodied
brew
overall
this
is
a
pretty
solid
quaff
i
poured
into
a
pint
glass
to
three
fingers
of
white
head
it
is
yellow
in
color
and
clear
there
is
not
much
of
a
smell
its
kind
of
sweet
the
taste
is
lackluster
as
well
it
is
very
bland
it
just
has
the
faintest
hints
of
hops
and
malt
it
is
watery
and
goes
down
like
it
one
of
those
mass
market
beers
where
it
is
hard
to
review
not
because
you
have
bad
things
to
say
simply
that
it
is
hard
to
say
much
at
all
moderate
malt
body
with
no
distinction
very
mildly
hopped
so
as
not
to
offend
the
casual
beer
drinker
enough
to
be
present
and
then
not
much
more
finish
was
clean
with
a
vague
lingering
bitterness
i
would
describe
this
as
vanilla
but
vanilla
at
least
has
a
distinctive
flavor
this
is
more
aptly
described
as
generic
d
clean
albeit
boring
flavors
all
around
beach
bum
will
find
its
place
amongst
the
craft
drinkers
in
the
ab
circle
looking
for
a
great
refreshing
summer
brew
with
some
good
taste
im
not
buying
it
though
dress
the
craftsmanship
anyway
you
want
but
im
never
taking
this
one
back
to
my
place
notes
like
my
review
hints
at
this
beer
is
definitely
nothing
special
me
and
my
friend
drank
this
because
we
had
never
heard
of
it
before
and
we
werent
even
planning
on
getting
a
beer
after
drinking
it
we
came
to
the
conclusion
that
it
had
to
be
a
bmc
product
turns
out
it
is
if
any
beer
makes
you
think
that
it
cant
be
too
good
i
was
not
very
impressed
with
beach
bum
blonde
ale
compared
to
other
summer
season
beers
ive
had
sam
adams
skinny
dip
honey
moon
ect
this
one
was
just
not
up
to
par
with
the
others
i
found
the
flavor
to
be
lacking
i
really
couldnt
detect
much
flavor
other
than
a
poor
aftertaste
there
are
better
options
if
you
want
a
summer
beer
a
pretty
innocuous
but
easy
drinking
blonde
ale
nothing
offputting
here
other
than
the
lack
of
deliverance
heh
of
the
listed
hop
ingredients
in
the
flavour
profile
also
i
couldnt
resist
cracking
this
particular
beer
after
having
trees
beach
blonde
a
few
days
ago
although
i
prefer
the
latters
imagery
eta
i
actually
rated
oe8
higher
and
the
rating
was
deserved
in
both
cases
this
rich
ale
pours
golden
with
medium
lacing
and
though
it
doesnt
offer
anything
too
remarkable
or
unique
it
does
shine
with
a
crisp
maltiness
that
walks
all
over
the
usual
summer
lager
lineup
more
than
drinkable
beach
bum
would
be
an
ideal
middlepoint
for
an
inexperienced
drinker
or
seasoned
lager
fan
to
be
gently
swayed
into
the
wide
and
wonderful
world
of
ales
decent
enough
i
was
in
gas
station
with
a
pretty
limited
selection
i
looked
over
and
saw
this
one
so
i
took
a
closer
look
at
the
package
23
ibus
got
my
attention
so
i
grabbed
a
6
pack
got
home
poured
it
into
a
glass
got
really
stoked
and
then
i
tasted
it
horrible
another
complete
failure
form
the
big
boys
ill
grab
a
steel
reserve
over
this
one
next
time
overall
its
not
bad
i
would
never
pay
for
one
in
a
tavern
but
i
would
select
this
over
a
bud
or
miller
lite
pours
to
a
straw
yellow
with
an
ok
head
but
nothing
to
write
home
about
not
a
lot
of
smell
to
go
by
there
is
a
weak
almost
stale
hops
flavor
smooth
but
has
an
aftertaste
of
hops
and
malt
it
seems
like
it
sticks
to
your
tongue
decent
but
not
one
to
go
out
of
your
way
for
poured
into
a
pint
glass
this
brew
has
a
pale
yellow
color
with
a
1
finger
white
head
that
settled
quickly
into
a
light
cap
no
lacing
left
the
aroma
is
slightly
of
hops
some
corn
lingers
there
is
no
major
hop
tastes
as
is
advertised
on
the
bottle
in
fact
this
is
a
thin
over
carbonated
slightly
hopped
version
of
a
bud
light
not
happy
with
it
but
it
was
a
single
bottle
purchase
for
the
review
so
not
too
mad
overall
this
is
a
very
boring
beer
and
nothing
i
would
ever
buy
it
just
doesnt
have
a
lot
going
on
hardly
any
flavors
a
lot
similar
to
a
macro
it
is
light
so
it
is
somewhat
drinkable
d
good
abv
pretty
easy
on
the
tongue
could
drink
a
ton
but
it
just
does
not
make
you
excited
little
on
a
flat
side
it
is
like
a
lighter
side
of
shock
top
which
is
much
better
it
takes
the
citrus
all
the
way
overall
with
the
sour
aftertaste
and
overcarbonated
feel
and
smell
i
wouldnt
consider
drinking
more
than
two
or
three
of
these
in
one
setting
however
for
the
summer
heat
i
would
bring
these
out
in
favor
of
what
other
beers
are
selfproclaimed
as
royalty
drinkabilityfinal
thoughts
well
i
dont
know
much
about
this
style
of
beer
other
than
the
small
description
here
on
beeradvocate
this
one
was
very
refreshing
crisp
clean
lager
like
really
id
say
just
about
anyone
can
throw
back
a
6pack
or
more
of
this
beer
on
a
hot
summer
day
i
certainly
could
not
bad
overall
but
i
would
explore
the
style
more
before
grabbing
this
brand
certainly
look
for
better
cheers
to
all
d
below
ave
drinkability
here
with
the
lemon
pledge
off
flavors
coming
through
making
for
a
less
then
average
finish
would
not
reach
for
a
second
one
let
alone
consider
a
six
pack
or
future
purchase
just
did
not
go
down
as
smooth
as
a
summer
blonde
should
even
with
its
watery
nature
very
macrolike
drink
that
starts
off
average
and
goes
down
hill
from
there
wouldnt
blame
anyone
for
dumping
this
midway
through
you
just
arent
going
to
get
much
out
of
this
so
why
bother
the
beer
isnt
my
favorite
not
quite
a
horrible
beer
as
stated
in
some
previous
review
there
just
really
isnt
anything
really
special
beer
i
do
agree
with
some
of
the
after
taste
comments
that
were
made
though
im
not
quite
sure
what
it
is
but
im
not
a
huge
fan
of
it
has
ok
smell
and
taste
nothing
that
really
jumps
out
mouthfeel
is
of
most
marcros
that
role
of
the
liquor
stores
daily
decently
drinkable
though
not
too
impressed
d
a
little
tasty
goes
down
easily
not
filling
at
all
mild
kick
decent
representation
of
style
its
not
a
bad
beer
but
there
are
better
light
alternative
out
there
really
not
that
good
at
all
typical
bud
nikki
dark
yellow
colored
beer
with
a
rapidly
fading
head
aroma
is
fruity
taste
is
pineapplecitrus
and
malts
a
pretty
decent
brew
that
goes
down
decently
its
nothing
that
will
knock
your
socks
off
but
still
overall
a
pretty
good
experience
i
probably
would
try
again
cheers
beach
bum
blonde
ale
pours
a
pale
golden
color
with
a
2
finger
head
smells
malty
and
sweet
tastes
good
with
smooth
malty
flavor
which
is
a
little
on
the
sweet
side
finishes
with
very
little
hop
flavor
this
beer
bring
to
mind
the
sweetness
of
a
red
stripe
but
its
quite
better
in
flavor
could
be
a
fine
session
beer
on
a
hot
southern
day
i
detect
some
metallic
taste
here
but
its
still
fairly
drinkable
there
are
some
reviews
on
here
that
talk
about
the
hops
of
this
beer
hops
really
im
not
really
sure
how
anybody
tasted
hops
in
this
beer
theyre
nonexistent
it
is
malty
but
tastes
really
really
watery
which
i
expected
once
i
saw
the
anheuserbusch
label
there
are
actually
some
decent
fruits
but
its
a
really
weak
presence
not
really
a
presence
at
all
actually
really
disappointing
i
was
hoping
to
cleanse
the
memory
of
landshark
lager
from
my
taste
buds
sadly
this
just
added
to
the
disappointment
havent
had
good
luck
with
new
beers
so
far
this
weekend
thank
god
for
dogfish
head
90
and
sam
boston
lager
a
light
golden
color
with
carbonation
bubbles
the
smell
is
corn
caramel
malt
and
yeast
the
taste
is
slightly
hoppy
with
a
hint
of
floral
and
pie
can
taste
toasted
malt
the
mouth
feel
is
thin
and
watery
no
finish
it
is
alright
for
a
budweiser
beer
pours
a
cleanclear
golden
yellow
color
nice
carbonation
nice
onefinger
creamy
white
head
with
some
sticky
lacing
left
behind
the
nose
is
malty
with
some
spice
the
taste
is
sweet
malty
and
spicy
medium
body
kinda
drinkable
not
too
bad
but
ive
had
better
blonde
ales
not
to
much
else
to
mention
pretty
good
for
lawn
beer
if
you
could
get
yourself
to
actually
buy
it
ab
is
moving
in
the
right
direction
with
this
and
its
other
seasonal
brews
to
me
this
is
a
crisp
ale
has
a
decent
blond
ale
flavor
with
a
bit
of
bitterness
it
does
taste
just
slightly
watered
down
it
is
from
anheuserbush
i
was
definitely
a
bit
skeptical
at
first
due
to
it
being
released
by
a
mega
brewer
but
when
my
local
store
was
selling
it
for
2
99
a
6pack
i
bought
a
case
and
was
impressed
with
its
overall
taste
its
refreshing
crisp
and
has
good
flavor
this
is
one
of
the
better
mega
brewer
lighter
beers
ive
had
out
of
the
bottle
this
ab
product
looked
surprisingly
good
white
head
one
finger
head
that
retained
well
and
laced
in
sheets
atop
a
bright
yellow
liquid
the
aroma
was
semisweet
lemon
and
sugary
malt
the
flavors
were
subdued
but
not
unpleasant
a
basic
balance
of
malt
and
hops
with
a
slightly
astringent
quality
and
no
outstanding
characteristics
the
mouthfeel
was
fine
medium
body
and
generally
refreshing
just
an
easy
going
non
thinking
entity
like
the
blonde
surfer
on
the
label
it
wasnt
not
good
but
it
was
too
lackadaisical
to
actually
call
it
bad
either
this
beer
was
simply
beer
and
you
could
drink
it
if
you
like
i
dont
know
if
the
month
of
extra
time
did
anything
to
the
beer
but
if
so
it
couldnt
have
been
anything
negative
this
is
a
great
refreshing
summer
beer
and
i
must
certainly
commend
the
boys
at
ab
for
mixing
this
one
up
mouthfeel
is
rather
boring
and
watery
its
a
drinkable
beer
in
that
its
unoffensive
but
its
certainly
not
good
drinkability
is
ok
this
is
a
lawnmower
beer
nothing
to
seek
out
ok
but
not
memorable
another
attempt
by
the
big
guys
at
craft
beer
so
far
i
havent
tasted
anything
by
these
guys
that
is
worthwhile
at
all
i
like
this
beer
after
the
head
settles
down
a
bit
it
has
a
great
dempled
lace
floating
taste
is
that
of
a
sweet
pale
ale
it
resembles
the
michelob
pale
ale
but
is
certainly
sweeter
with
all
this
sweetness
it
still
tastes
very
well
balanced
actually
the
hops
are
the
first
thing
i
noticed
however
it
got
progressivly
sweeter
after
that
its
a
great
beer
to
drink
on
a
chilly
late
summer
night
like
i
said
i
like
it
and
incase
you
were
wondering
yes
i
know
that
it
is
made
by
ab
cheers
serving
type
bottle
d
easy
to
put
these
down
if
bud
man
wants
to
spice
up
his
beer
life
it
would
be
good
for
them
a
decent
brew
from
anny
there
are
certainly
numerous
better
summer
beers
available
not
a
beer
i
would
drink
again
given
other
options
notes
no
complaints
here
ab
or
not
reminds
me
of
brooklyn
summer
ale
purchased
as
part
of
buildyourownsixpack
at
local
grocer
poured
a
thick
head
on
a
golden
body
there
was
a
nice
surprising
sweetness
to
the
smell
which
was
sadly
nowhere
to
be
found
in
the
taste
instead
had
an
icky
dustiness
and
a
poor
coating
aftertaste
fairly
boring
actually
but
i
didnt
have
very
high
hopes
to
start
with
given
the
maker
d
this
is
a
pretty
good
gateway
beer
i
kind
of
like
this
pseudo
craft
from
ab
it
has
a
decent
taste
thats
refreshing
for
summer
good
to
get
if
your
at
a
bar
that
only
has
bmc
products
nothing
great
nothing
bad
easy
to
drink
and
moderately
flavorful
d
for
what
it
is
its
drinkable
its
not
bad
on
a
summer
day
being
that
it
has
a
thirst
quenching
effect
poured
on
tap
into
a
22
oz
mug
pours
a
light
golden
color
with
a
light
head
that
did
not
last
all
i
can
really
smell
is
a
light
spice
with
a
citrus
aroma
the
taste
is
very
light
again
with
the
citrus
and
spice
but
a
dry
hop
taste
comes
through
at
the
end
the
taste
isnt
bad
i
was
just
hoping
for
more
taste
the
beer
has
a
nice
feel
to
it
as
it
is
not
to
light
or
heavy
with
the
carbonation
and
is
easy
to
drink
as
a
summer
time
beer
recommended
d
i
know
i
could
definately
drink
a
lot
of
this
beer
in
the
summer
months
d
its
not
bad
for
a
hot
summer
day
but
theres
other
ones
id
pick
over
it
not
as
bad
as
i
expectedbut
once
one
has
had
a
taste
of
good
beer
why
even
bother
with
gimmicky
stuff
like
this
i
tried
it
because
it
was
free
and
i
really
hoped
that
ab
would
finally
deliver
a
true
hitnot
to
be
try
again
end
of
story
theres
cheaper
more
drinkable
beer
available
stay
away
from
this
crap
it
might
be
a
blonde
ale
not
at
all
comparable
to
a
kolsch
and
more
similar
to
an
american
macro
lager
so
this
is
what
it
tastes
like
to
mix
val
deiu
with
water
because
if
that
is
what
anheuserbusch
was
going
for
they
have
suceeded
it
is
definitely
a
blonde
looking
ale
with
the
gold
and
the
cloudiness
but
that
about
it
smells
of
sweet
grains
and
corn
from
the
school
cafeteria
tastes
well
like
a
perfectly
good
val
deiu
shaken
up
and
diluted
with
toilet
water
the
fact
i
got
this
on
tap
at
a
dirty
bar
in
fort
myers
with
that
being
their
special
seasonal
says
it
all
eh
ah
um
er
shucks
burp
it
is
a
beer
confidant
of
that
nothing
offending
much
better
than
nothing
i
guess
think
i
have
to
trim
my
toe
nails
now
oh
thats
right
this
beer
clear
yellow
somewhat
fizzy
beery
a
littlle
bittersweet
forgetful
some
head
and
lace
at
least
my
advice
is
to
avoid
this
one
unless
you
like
overpriced
bland
beer
like
corona
draft
in
denver
airport
medium
gold
pour
with
little
white
quickly
fading
head
smell
is
very
light
of
sweet
malts
and
it
somehow
almost
even
smells
watery
taste
is
fairly
smooth
and
crisp
with
a
hop
bitter
bite
up
front
that
lasts
followed
eventually
by
a
little
sweet
finish
nothing
spectacular
more
bitter
than
expected
but
without
any
hop
flavor
to
go
with
it
really
simple
bitterish
cheap
easy
drinking
beer
that
i
wouldnt
go
out
of
my
way
for
or
recommend
got
this
at
a
wing
joint
in
chesapeake
was
on
tap
so
i
ordered
it
and
was
greeted
w
onefinger
head
that
receeded
and
didnt
leave
lacings
the
body
is
a
light
golden
color
nothing
spectacular
there
is
some
faint
citrusyeast
picked
up
in
the
smell
and
that
is
what
it
tasted
like
for
a
blonde
ale
i
expected
there
to
be
more
malt
or
more
hops
in
it
for
that
little
bit
of
extra
tastedryness
this
was
just
watery
and
more
of
a
american
pale
wheat
ale
since
it
was
really
smooth
and
citrusy
in
my
mouth
id
have
a
couple
of
these
for
a
dollar
draft
now
and
then
but
nothing
to
buy
a
6pack
for
d
probably
pretty
decent
i
could
do
a
sixer
i
remember
trying
this
on
tap
when
this
years
batch
was
released
and
not
enjoying
it
nearly
as
much
probably
dirty
lines
im
glad
ab
brews
the
seasonal
beers
theyre
not
bad
and
they
ensure
in
my
area
at
least
that
there
will
always
be
something
other
than
a
water
lager
to
drink
when
im
in
a
mainstream
locale
presentation
packaged
in
a
twelveounce
brown
glass
long
neck
bottle
with
a
twistoff
crown
served
in
a
standard
pint
tap
glass
d
would
be
easy
to
pound
down
a
few
but
the
taste
is
not
good
enough
to
light
on
the
stomach
and
not
bad
i
just
would
not
want
this
to
be
the
beer
i
supply
for
my
friends
at
a
tasting
party
or
anything
from
a
12
oz
bottle
this
was
very
mild
and
light
yellow
light
white
head
with
almost
no
lacing
nose
of
mild
citrus
and
a
very
light
mouthfeel
flavor
very
light
malts
and
a
touch
of
hops
actually
one
of
the
better
brews
from
ab
but
still
pretty
plain
and
average
thank
you
god
for
putting
this
on
pallet
special
at
walmart
right
before
my
football
party
this
beer
was
at
the
appropriate
price
of
2
60
a
six
pack
also
it
kept
everyone
away
from
my
dead
guy
on
draft
perfectly
placed
in
a
bucket
of
ice
outside
in
our
football
theatre
i
obviously
tried
to
say
really
nice
things
about
this
malt
liquor
no
smell
to
it
and
tasted
similar
to
a
budweiser
light
to
me
just
with
more
alcohol
this
beer
has
decent
initial
head
that
fades
very
very
quickly
has
a
nice
pale
malt
smell
with
faint
hops
taste
is
a
little
one
dimensional
and
lack
luster
but
it
makes
the
beer
drinkable
a
decent
summer
ale
worth
a
try
but
i
fancy
other
summer
ales
more
not
a
lot
to
say
about
the
flavor
profile
not
a
whole
lot
going
on
poured
from
the
bottle
into
a
pint
glass
beer
is
a
light
clear
golden
color
with
a
thin
bubbly
white
head
smell
is
nothing
overpowering
mostly
slightly
sweet
maltiness
with
just
a
hint
of
citrus
the
taste
is
also
pretty
much
all
malt
too
but
there
is
a
slight
spiciness
about
it
and
moderate
hop
bitterness
the
mouthfeel
is
medium
bodied
slightly
velvety
with
a
modest
carbonation
a
decently
drinkable
brew
not
the
greatest
out
there
but
i
do
have
to
salute
ab
for
expanding
their
horizons
a
decent
beer
overall
and
drinkable
but
nothing
worth
seeking
out
i
will
take
a
lemon
with
me
if
i
need
refreshing
some
better
hop
aroma
and
flavor
would
make
this
a
respectable
summer
session
beer
one
of
abs
better
efforts
among
their
recent
microattempts
not
the
best
blonde
ive
had
but
very
decent
nice
job
ab
d
this
beer
does
seem
pretty
drinkable
since
it
is
a
nice
light
refreshing
summer
beer
unfortunately
it
is
more
alcoholic
than
malty
which
takes
away
from
its
decent
body
and
mouthfeel
i
still
would
say
either
is
worth
a
try
an
ok
drinkable
beer
but
not
one
i
can
see
buying
again
basically
this
is
michelob
in
ale
form
worth
trying
once
i
guess
but
i
really
cant
see
picking
this
over
a
michelob
lager
if
this
was
one
of
the
meager
choices
all
and
all
not
too
bad
for
a
ab
product
happy
they
are
trying
more
craft
beers
beach
bum
blonde
ale
pours
golden
yellow
with
a
white
head
from
a
brown
twelve
ounce
bottle
there
is
a
very
mild
sweet
aroma
this
beer
is
more
flavorful
than
i
would
have
expected
from
ab
especially
in
a
blonde
ale
hops
in
particular
are
more
prominent
than
i
would
have
expected
mediocre
but
better
than
expected
the
beer
is
a
yellow
a
gold
color
with
a
thin
white
head
that
quickly
fades
away
the
smell
though
light
has
some
pale
malt
along
with
a
light
hop
aroma
the
taste
is
good
there
is
a
nice
balance
of
pale
malt
flavor
and
finishes
with
a
light
hop
taste
the
mouthfeel
is
light
bodied
with
good
carbonation
clean
tasting
easy
to
drink
this
is
a
pretty
good
blonde
ale
another
one
designed
to
be
light
refreshing
and
easy
to
drink
golden
pour
without
much
head
kind
of
thin
mouthfeel
not
much
lacing
on
glass
fruity
taste
not
heinous
like
most
ab
products
but
nothing
memorable
about
it
either
smell
was
fruity
as
well
the
smell
was
actually
better
than
the
taste
ab
should
probably
stick
to
making
crappy
pale
lagers
this
plays
very
well
off
some
buffalo
chicken
pizza
i
had
a
couple
of
these
out
of
a
6er
a
few
days
ago
and
when
i
started
eating
the
pizza
tonight
i
knew
i
had
to
have
one
of
these
blondes
in
between
and
then
with
a
slice
i
think
it
would
match
any
spicy
food
it
tastes
more
malty
when
enjoyed
with
spicy
food
d
believe
me
i
am
a
fan
of
budweiser
and
not
afraid
to
say
it
i
think
anheuserbusch
makes
mass
quantities
of
respectful
beer
however
the
beach
bum
was
simply
that
a
bum
not
impressive
and
not
something
i
plan
on
trying
again
i
am
curious
to
still
try
their
other
seasonal
brews
though
this
corny
beer
is
corny
light
bodied
and
somewhat
refreshing
despite
the
corn
flavor
did
i
mention
that
this
beer
has
a
lot
of
corn
character
the
beer
pours
a
gold
color
with
a
thin
white
head
that
quickly
fades
to
lacing
the
aroma
is
decent
it
has
a
light
and
refreshing
pale
malt
scent
along
with
a
light
hop
aroma
it
appears
crisp
and
clean
the
taste
is
good
it
has
a
smooth
pale
malt
flavor
that
goes
down
very
easily
and
finishes
clean
with
a
light
hop
taste
the
mouthfeel
is
fine
it
is
a
low
bodied
beer
with
good
carbonation
this
is
a
pretty
good
blonde
ale
its
nothing
too
incredible
but
its
an
easy
drinker
im
glad
to
see
ab
taking
a
stab
at
different
styles
drinkability
alright
maybe
a
little
refreshing
even
though
kind
of
drank
like
a
winter
beer
overall
a
decent
ale
tastes
very
much
like
michelob
perhaps
with
ale
yeast
i
didnt
know
this
was
an
ab
product
and
i
must
tip
my
hat
to
themi
really
enjoyed
this
beer
and
would
not
mind
having
it
again
definitely
not
a
macrolager
this
is
a
wellmade
blonde
ale
thanks
to
pegasus
for
the
karma
point
drinkability
sure
a
good
summer
offering
with
a
at
home
summer
label
the
beer
has
a
fruity
smell
and
great
fruit
flavor
the
hops
help
with
the
fruit
aroma
but
there
is
not
enough
kick
to
keep
it
going
the
beer
loses
some
steam
after
room
temp
hits
it
this
is
a
great
summer
beer
and
is
definitely
better
on
draft
than
in
the
bottle
served
fresh
from
the
brewery
on
tap
poured
into
a
sample
glass
approx
8
oz
a
clear
golden
yellow
with
a
foamy
white
head
that
has
decent
retention
aroma
is
fruity
along
with
some
floral
hops
and
a
touch
of
pine
as
well
taste
has
a
nice
fruity
pressence
also
pretty
clean
and
refreshing
beer
not
an
exciting
style
but
a
nice
representation
pretty
solid
effort
from
ab
this
should
be
their
flagship
beer
marketed
to
the
masses

drinkability

is

not
a
bad
summer
beer
at
all
its
nice
and
refreshing
id
buy
it
again
inoffensive
and
clean
nothing
bad
about
it
clean
and
inoffensive
though
boring
typicalaverage
for
the
style
i
didnt
realize
that
it
was
made
by
ab
until
finished
with
it
and
i
do
have
to
say
that
for
the
brewery
and
style
its
okay
and
decent
enough
to
wash
down
a
burger
with
but
even
still
not
worth
seeking
out
and
it
is
rather
bland
dont
drink
and
review
drinkability
lets
thank
andobrew
and
give
him
a
big
surfs
up
for
bringing
this
by
abs
beach
bum
blonde
ale
pours
a
finger
of
foam
over
a
clear
gold
brew
the
foam
collapses
pretty
quickly
despite
the
steady
carbonation
the
nose
is
light
malt
the
flavor
is
sweet
malt
with
a
bit
of
corn
in
the
mix
and
a
ghost
of
an
herbal
hop
finish
the
mouthfeel
was
thin
and
crisp
not
an
awesome
brew
by
any
means
but
quite
pleasant
anyway
a
good
session
brew
for
sure
recommended
are
we
tired
of
these
underwhelming
summer
beers
or
what
pours
with
the
typical
creamyish
anheiser
head
and
typically
dissapears
quickly
like
a
sober
prom
date
the
problem
here
is
one
that
plagues
many
mass
produced
seasonal
offerings
the
flavors
come
off
as
artificial
and
unpleasant
instead
of
natural
and
complentary
there
is
a
lemon
sweetness
here
that
tastes
like
somebody
dropped
a
yellow
spree
in
my
bottle
no
hops
to
be
detected
some
strange
florals
here
again
they
just
dont
taste
natural
as
i
move
on
to
a
second
one
i
leave
it
threequarters
full
and
crack
a
high
life
with
a
huge
smile
on
my
face
leave
this
one
for
the
real
bums
there
is
a
local
offering
that
isnt
much
better
but
it
is
better
terrapin
golden
ale6
996
well
call
it
less
artificial
tasting
overall
i
would
put
this
ab
season
as
second
place
behind
the
pumkin
ale
i
dont
find
anything
that
i
hate
about
it
but
little
that
i
like
from
it
i
think
it
is
more
drinkable
than
the
regular
offerings
from
bud
and
could
be
a
safety
beer
if
that
is
all
they
serve
but
i
could
never
imagine
getting
a
six
pack
of
this
and
enjoying
it
within
a
day
or
two
overall
this
is
not
really
a
step
up
from
most
macros
and
id
actually
take
a
fair
number
of
macros
over
this
golden
in
color
with
a
small
white
head
citrusy
and
slightly
hoppy
aroma
clean
malty
flavor
with
a
hint
of
hop
bite
to
it
somewhat
lemony
flavor
with
a
touch
of
spice
ok
bodyquite
thin
and
along
the
lines
of
a
macro
i
find
this
to
be
quite
a
nice
summers
beer
overall
very
refreshing
and
drinkable
the
guy
in
the
store
said
something
about
it
originating
in
atlanta
and
being
sold
to
ab
got
me
but
it
is
a
decent
effort
a
bit
pricey
though
i
think
it
was
mis
marked
once
i
checked
my
receipt
nice
clear
golden
color
with
a
three
finger
white
frothy
head
that
holds
well
and
a
fair
amount
of
lacing
slightly
fruity
aroma
taste
slightly
bready
and
yeasty
with
a
grainy
hop
finish
mouthfeel
light
and
carbonation
is
good
to
plain
jane
for
me
needs
some
spice
to
kick
it
up
much
better
beer
out
there
i
am
surprised
at
how
enjoyable
this
one
was
overall
the
anheuser
craft
brews
are
all
decent
for
the
most
part
but
id
say
that
this
one
has
been
the
cream
of
the
crop
for
them
with
their
craft
stuff
it
doesnt
have
a
wow
factor
but
it
is
more
than
solid
all
around
and
simply
a
tasty
refreshing
brew
recommended
light
bodied
smooth
and
easy
to
drink
a
nice
summer
cooler
that
should
go
well
with
grilled
meat
or
barbecue
beach
bum
blonde
ale
was
a
clear
golden
color
with
a
white
head
the
head
was
medium
size
and
had
decent
retention
with
a
little
lacing
the
aroma
was
light
hops
with
some
sweet
malt
the
taste
was
spicy
hops
with
some
light
malt
and
a
dry
finish
it
was
crisp
and
refreshing
with
a
light
body
and
plenty
of
carbonation
drinkabity
was
good
overall
it
was
a
decent
summer
beer
this
one
screams
to
be
paired
with
some
summer
barbeque
or
picnic
food
and
it
also
can
be
used
to
turn
your
macro
swilling
friends
onto
to
slightly
more
adventurous
fare
and
im
sure
it
would
be
one
that
would
be
ok
to
drink
out
of
the
bottle
note
ab
has
4
seasonal
sudocraft
brews
3
of
which
i
have
tried
and
theyre
pretty
decent
beers
this
particular
one
is
my
favorite
so
far
pours
clear
and
light
gold
a
very
pretty
color
with
no
head
only
a
collar
of
foam
around
the
top
of
the
beer
aromas
are
of
light
slight
grainy
malts
with
just
a
touch
of
corn
in
the
background
which
is
not
offputting
fresh
continental
hop
smell
mixed
with
minor
strawberry
esters
nice
on
the
palate
the
flavors
are
well
balanced
with
brisk
straightforward
bitterness
first
off
felt
on
the
sides
and
back
on
the
tongue
followed
by
a
growing
graininess
through
the
midpalate
and
culminating
in
a
somewhat
sweet
finish
with
a
flash
of
unripe
pear
at
the
very
end
in
the
back
of
the
throat
there
are
hops
here
for
balance
but
they
dont
add
much
in
the
way
of
flavor
aside
from
an
airy
taste
at
the
beginning
mouthfeel
is
light
in
malts
and
heavy
on
carbonation
overall
this
beer
is
pretty
good
one
of
the
better
ab
craft
attempts
imo
it
should
be
enjoyed
cold
as
it
falls
apart
a
bit
at
warmer
temperatures
but
it
accomplishes
its
intended
purpose
being
a
thirst
quenching
light
and
simple
beer
well
its
fresh
and
clean
and
bright
very
wellbalanced
and
remarkably
drinkable
with
an
easy
going
charm
and
enough
hop
character
to
keep
you
coming
back
for
more
id
gladly
enjoy
a
few
of
these
with
friends
at
a
bbq
camping
trip
or
sports
event
worth
trying
despite
the
label
poured
a
thin
looking
orange
brown
white
head
that
dissolved
almost
instantly
and
nearly
flat
nose
had
a
hint
of
citrus
to
it
but
no
more
than
a
whisp
flavor
was
subdied
as
if
drinking
through
a
coffee
filter
very
flat
in
flavor
some
very
mild
wheat
any
citrus
i
could
smell
was
not
present
in
the
flavor
light
body
without
much
of
a
finish
still
very
easily
drinkable
but
a
bad
take
as
a
craft
beer
i
am
glad
my
friend
brought
this
sixpac
over
to
share
because
i
would
have
disappointed
if
i
paid
cash
for
it
overall
impression
not
bad
certainly
drinkable
enough
and
i
would
take
this
over
a
normal
bud
any
day
this
might
be
a
savior
in
a
bmc
bar
pours
a
clear
gold
head
poured
about
12
inch
with
dense
bubbles
then
quickly
1
minute
dissipated
to
a
film
some
lacing
only
a
mild
sweet
smell
to
this
but
not
unpleasant
taste
has
more
of
the
same
a
mild
sweet
flavor
i
too
tasted
lemon
toward
the
finish
of
this
beer
finish
of
the
tastethat
isnot
the
finish
of
the
bottle
the
hops
in
this
one
came
off
less
like
citrushoppy
and
more
like
citruscitrusy
it
could
be
me
or
there
may
be
some
actual
lemon
in
this
beer
backing
the
hops
either
way
they
were
very
much
a
background
flavor
it
may
have
been
the
glass
of
the
particular
way
i
was
drinking
this
beer
but
all
the
carbonation
seemed
to
settle
toward
the
back
of
my
tongue
golden
colored
beer
with
a
largish
pure
white
head
aroma
very
weak
what
there
is
suggests
lagerish
hops
lightly
malty
flavour
semisweet
a
small
very
small
amount
of
lemony
hop
right
at
the
end
thin
and
no
after
taste
overall
not
a
good
beer
or
even
a
good
blonde
but
cant
say
if
i
was
at
a
neighbours
grillout
i
would
refuse
it
pours
a
golden
color
darker
than
your
standard
busch
macro
beer
by
a
couple
of
shades
i
see
very
little
carbonation
i
can
practically
count
the
bubbles
and
id
only
need
one
hand
the
head
disappeared
almost
instantly
with
almost
no
lacing
or
collar
there
is
a
very
faint
sweetish
aroma
taste
is
a
very
weak
kinda
lemony
bitterness
theres
a
grassy
dryness
on
the
finish
with
a
thin
watery
mouthfeel
i
really
wanted
to
like
this
beer
for
some
reason
but
i
cant
give
it
a
thumbsup
by
any
means
i
bought
a
single
total
wine
more
in
claymont
de
and
im
glad
i
didnt
shell
out
the
money
for
a
sixer
an
extremely
weak
attempt
by
anheuserbusch
with
their
resources
they
can
do
much
better
than
this

can
they

this
is
a

its

man
those
things
smell
good
it
even
has
some
backbone
with
the
malt
id
have
to
say
its
almost
the
blonde
ale
that
strove
to
be
a
pale
ale
except
for
the
brightness
this
is
a
great
beer
for
the

for
the
6pk
i
got
it
for
its
a
good
deal

that
the

place
has
sam
adams
and
its
ilk
for
about
8
im
sure
that
at
5
99
this
beer
is
a
steal
looks
like
ab
is
intimidated
by
the
micro
brew
market
so
they
are
selling
their
own
it
is
obvious
that
ab
will
never
go
over
the
top
on
a
beer
since
they
aim
to
make
beer
tasteless
for
the
masses
this
is
a
decent
beer
but
could
potentially
be
better
i
taste
a
little
bit
of
sourness
and
smell
it
as
well
it
claims
to
be
all
malt
and
that
probably
makes
it
better
than
their
rice
beers
slight
citrusy
flavor
from
orange
and
not
a
bad
summer
session
beer
overall
would
probably
go
well
with
a
burger
from
the
grill
saw
this
at
a
beer
tent
and
had
never
heard
of
it
before
i
normally
shy
away
from
ab
products
but
figured
i
would
give
it
a
shot
poured
was
a
pale
golden
yellow
with
a
huge
white
head
the
smell
was
actually
ok
with
hints
of
some
fruitiness
in
there
and
a
slight
grainey
toned
the
flavor
was
actually
quite
suprisingly
good
this
was
not
bad
at
all
lots
of
light
fruit
with
a
big
carbonated
feel
really
a
decent
session
beer
and
i
was
quite
suprised
by
how
good
this
actually
turned
up
ab
may
actually
have
something
worth
drinking
here
will
have
to
give
it
another
try
before
i
commit
totally
but
really
not
bad
the
character
on

label
looks
like

taste
is
as
it

amplified
a
bit
a

with
a

bitterness
in
the

that
becomes
dry
in

could

with

well
when
i
saw
this
on
tap
i
was
unaware
it
was
an
ab
product
so
at
least
i
wasnt
swayed
by
that
in
the
begining
my
pint
was
yellow
in
color
clear
and
had
a
small
head
and
had
a
slightly
citrusfloral
aroma
i
thought
the
flavor
was
a
little
on
the
weak
side
not
really
a
blonde
that
stands
out
there
was
a
mild
hop
flavor
and
a
touch
of
citrus
with
general
sweetness
throughout
overall
id
say
find
a
different
blonde
if
that
is
your
thing
drinkability
there
was
something
odd
about
this
beer
that
i
can
not
fully
explain
while
i
had
a
couple
of
these
and
they
drank
like
a
macro
easy
to
pound
down
light
and
refreshing
i
just
got
tired
of
them
i
guess
i
was
easily
bored
by
this
beer
probably
not
a
good
sign
maybe
worth
a
try
if
one
comes
across
it
but
not
worth
going
out
of
the
way
for
this
is
brewed
by
ab
so
i
really
wasnt
expecting
much
however
i
had
it
on
tap
on
the
deck
of
a
bar
in
st
simons
island
on
a
90
degree
summer
night
and
must
say
i
was
pleasantly
surprised
by
this
summer
brew
poured
to
a
golden
orange
with
medium
offwhite
head
and
okay
lacing
there
was
a
slight
citrus
aroma
mostly
grapefruit
and
lemons
which
were
more
evident
in
the
taste
the
palate
was
smooth
and
long
and
actually
reminded
me
of
a
mild
version
of
an
ipa
not
a
bad
beer
im
surprised
this
has
anything
to
do
with
ab
considering
the
garbage
they
put
out
these
days
this
was
a
definite
highlight
if
you
see
a
little
beach
bum
surfer
on
a
tap
handle
its
beach
bum
blonde
ale
and
it
is
excellent
taste
good
and
it
isnt
overly
filling
so
you
can
do
a
bit
of
chugging
the
tint
is
a
blonde
heading
to
red
and
is
really
something
i
like
to
have
sitting
in
front
of
me
it
smells
good
tastes
good
and
is
easy
to
drink
i
cant
promise
the
same
reviews
for
this
beer
not
on
tap
but
ontapwhew
grab
a
couple
pints
this
beer
poured
a
golden
clear
with
a
thin
head
the
smell
was
faint
and
a
bit
malty
the
taste
was
sweet
and
smooth
with
a
touch
of
citrus
it
has
a
medium
body
and
a
nice
mouthfeel
this
is
a
smooth
and
clean
beer
id
consider
this
an
easily
drinkable
american
beer
overall
suprisingly
decent
offering
from
ab
pretty
good
lite
ale
flavor
worth
a
try
if
you
see
it
somewhere
overall
this
is
a
very
bad
attempt
at
a
blonde
ab
has
millions
of
dollars
and
after
all
their
rd
they
realized
their
minions
love
cheap
pss
beer
so
they
did
the
inevitable
produced
yet
another
1
stay
far
away
from
this
pss
not
sure
i
like
the
flavor
of
the
bitterness
but
there
is
a
summer
thirst
quenching
quality
that
is
appealing
enough
i
had
a
test
blonde
ale
earlier
served
by
ab
brewmaster
that
had
a
nicer
mouthfeel
and
more
substantial
taste
hope
it
did
not
bring
this
one
down
per
ab
website

abv
had
this
on
tap
at
a
bar
in
south
haven
and
i
had
no
idea
it
was
an
anheuser
product
until
looking
it
up
here
bright
clear
yellow
color
with
a
thick
foamy
head
that
dissipates
quickly
and
leaves
no
remnants
of
its
being
there
aroma
is
somewhat
spicy
almost
tangy
like
the
juice
with
a
straight
pale
malt
dryness
taste
is
similar
to
aroma
i
noticed
an
adjunct
flavor
that
didnt
dominate
but
it
didnt
leave
the
palate
either
slight
spice
and
tang
with
a
cereal
like
aspect
a
bit
muddled
really
and
although
not
sweet
it
seemed
cloying
by
the
end
of
the
glass
odd
not
really
enjoyable
i
dont
care
if
this
is
ab
or
not
i
liked
it
and
drank
more
than
my
shares
worth
at
a
4th
of
july
picnic
right
from
the
tap
this
is
just
as
good
as
anything
id
enjoy
at
a
hot
summer
bbq
too
much
carbonation
fresh
hops
and
very
drinkable
its
nothing
i
would
buy
a
six
pack
of
my
would
always
drink
it
if
its
free
hot
and
the
other
choices
are
limited
i
personally
did
not
enjoy
this
beer
very
much
it
smelled
of
corn
and
looked
just
like
a
lot
of
ahbs
macro
swill
i
thought
it
tasted
like
a
mix
between
miller
high
life
and
miller
genuine
draft
with
a
much
more
alcoholic
aftertaste
i
found
the
highly
alcoholic
to
be
a
big
turnoff
there
was
also
a
lot
of
carbonation
ala
mhl
i
ordered
this
one
in
flordia
with
alligator
tail
thinkin
it
would
be
some
cool
local
brewed
beer
only
to
find
out
it
was
simply
a
beer
that
they
changes
the
name
to
and
it
was
made
my
anheuser
busch
anyways
i
will
never
be
drinkin
this
on
the
beach
or
anywhere
else
for
that
matter
it
poured
a
light
strawish
yellow
that
was
perfectly
transcendent
smelled
very
sweet
and
citrusy
tasted
far
to
lame
and
was
a
rather
unenjoyable
beer
while
it
did
not
taste
bad
it
sinply
did
not
taste
unique
or
fun
or
complex
it
was
just
straight
up
boring
on
tap
at
hemingways
cafe
in
oakland
appears
a
clear
golden
tone
with
a
white
head
that
dwindles
ratherly
quickly
leaves
behind
light
lacing
aroma
has
some
fruity
apple
esters
with
more
of
tart
spicy
sweetness
taste
has
a
creamy
sweetness
with
herbal
hop
flavor
along
with
a
spicy
alcohol
finish
and
a
bit
more
of
a
tea
leaf
citrus
blend
going
on
mouthfeel
is
light
bodied
carbonation
seems
a
bit
fizzy
still
drinkability
well
its
not
what
im
going
for
especially
for
4
50
a
pint
glad
i
had
a
sample
aroma
is
light
but
has
perfumey
hops
that
smell
both
fruity
and
floral
almost
has
a
coriander
wit
type
aroma
but
much
less
concentrated
body
is
clear
gold
with
a
diminishing
thumb
thick
head
fore
is
lightly
hopped
but
the
hops
are
floral
and
pleasant
fairly
watery
but
this
has
some
flavor
big
citrus
kick
in
the
middle
and
finish
tastes
like
orange
peel
and
orange
juice
and
its
fairly
well
hopped
flavor
wise
for
the
style
and
especially
for
a
bud
product
has
a
fairly
lagery
flavor
in
the
far
finish
that
is
grainy
and
malty
sweet
but
this
is
not
at
all
a
bad
beer
the
women
in
the
household
like
it
so
there
ya
gothumbs
up
for
a
good
endeavor
by
ab
the
lastest
bud
attempt
i
had
to
try
it
nice
golden
color
but
the
head
and
any
form
of
retention
was
lost
right
away
no
lacing
smell
is
not
bad
a
good
fruityness
a
little
peachy
and
a
touch
of
malt
sweetness
i
think
the
yeast
they
use
in
these
special
bud
releases
is
not
right
the
beer
is
ok
with
a
decent
depth
of
malt
character
and
a
little
fruity
esters
but
there
is
also
some
off
that
is
bothersome
the
body
is
probably
a
little
too
thick
of
all
thing
for
a
blonde
but
i
had
two
glass
so
it
wasnt
horrible
if
you
are
curious
not
a
terrible
beer
overall
but
i
wasnt
impressed
with
it
in
all
the
categories
especially
taste
id
certainly
choose
this
over
bud
or
bud
light
though
i
had
to
ask
for
a
lemon
after
refusing
a
lemon
i
can
normally
get
behind
macros
more
so
than
a
lot
of
bas
because
hey
theyre
still
beer
but
the
particular
mixture
of
cheap
grained
used
by
ab
never
works
for
me
this
is
one
to
avoid
unless
your
only
other
options
are
bud
and
bud
light
can
someone
overthink
a
beer
if
so
this
is
quite
possibly
proof
bought
a
pint
at
my
favorite
lexington
bierstube
upon
the
bartenders
recommendation
shes
an
idiot
graininess
wateryness
astringency
and
vegetableness
is
evident
right
from
the
getgo
looks
pilsnerish
with
promising
head
retention
that
soon
fell
flat
the
aroma
is
purely
of
wet
grain
hulls
tastes
lightly
lemony
above
the
adjuct
grain
flavors
vegetal
and
apples
also
decorate
the
banal
flavors
feels
astingent
in
the
jaws
from
a
lemon
rind
and
stressed
grain
flavors
finishes
with
a
fleeting
hurry
except
for
the
biteey
hookup
in
the
back
of
the
thoat
it
makes
budweiser
look
pretty
good
overall
a
good
offering
from
ab
that
i
thought
was
above
average
i
would
even
go
so
far
as
to
say
that
i
would
buy
this
packaged
on
occasion
if
it
was
ever
offered

such
d
nice
and
crisp

a

of

not
much
else
drinkability
average
at
best
i
think
some
of
the
other
ab
offerings
in
this
line
of
specialty
beers
are
better
give
it
a
try
but
this
didnt
do
it
for
me
when
the
bar
has
dfh
smutty
and
victory
as
alternative
choices
i
was
pleasantly
surprised
by
this
one
i
got
it
on
tap
a
bit
late
for
the
season
but
i
thought
it
to
be
a
good
crisp
tasty
brew
id
definitely
get
it
again
its
very
smooth
going
down
me
likey
mouthfeel
is
light
and
refreshing
i
could
see
this
as
an
an
every
day
go
to
summer
beer
overall
ah
a
very
lack
luster
beer
nothing
was
all
that
great
a
rather
weak
look
and
very
little
aroma
with
the
flavors
never
really
find
a
balance
and
the
body
was
a
bit
off
for
me
not
one
i
will
likely
do
again
hazy
gold
appearance
with
nice
lacing
floral
aromas
of
yeast
followed
by
some
grain
and
stone
fruits
good
mouth
feel
with
medium
body
and
nice
effervescence
bone
dry
taste
with
a
tight
hoppy
finish
this
is
a
very
solid
beer
and
great
for
summer
session
drinking
overall
not
much
flavor
or
discernable
qualities
average
all
the
way
around
overall
i
feel
this
beer
meets
all
the
criteria
of
an
american
blond
ale
and
many
of
a
farmhouse
ale
as
well
as
they
seem
similar
and
in
that
respect
i
am
going
to
give
it
high
marks
to
add
to
that
the
extreme
pleasantness
of
this
beer
is
also
going
to
get
it
a

score
and
i
dont
see
why
it
has
gotten
lower
scores
on

somewhat
light
had
good
flavor
on
a
light
to
medium
bodied
ale
well
carbonated
overall
this
is
a
nice
session
ale
o
im
not
sure
where
the
farmhouse
term
comes
from
here
the
yeast
is
way
too
cleansubdued
as
a
simple
blond
ale
though
its
okay
i
wouldnt
pick
it
up
again
though
o
this
beer
is
very
easy
to
drink
and
has
some
thirstquenching
properties
its
definitely
sessionable
and
i
would
have
no
problem
knocking
back
a
few
of
these
on
a
summer
day
the
overall
taste
is
pretty
good
when
compared
to
other
beers
in
this
style
d
nothing
crazy
about
this
brew
just
an
easy
drinker
and
very
simple
o
a
little
tasty
goes
down
ok
not
too
filling
mild
kick
decent
representation
of
style
its
a
solid
beer
but
there
are
better
choices
within
the
style
a
very
clean
golden
yellow
pour
with
a
very
minimal
amount
of
head
smells
fruity
strawberry
bready
and
citrusy
orangelemon
peels
there
is
a
taste
of
fresh
apples
up
front
followed
by
a
slight
funky
bitterness
from
the
yeast
i
assume
light
body
with
high
carbonation
still
has
a
creamy
feel
to
it
and
is
very
crisp
and
refreshing
there
isnt
much
in
the
taste
department
aside
from
sweet
and
fruity
but
its
a
simple
beer
like
this
that
i
can
find
myself
going
back
to
next
year
and
making
it
my
summer
goto
beer
especially
with
this
price
tag
pours
a
murky
light
orange
with
a
12
inch
foamy
khaki
head
that
settles
to
a
film
on
top
of
the
beer
small
dots
of
lace
form
around
the
glass
on
the
drink
down
smell
is
of
grain
wheat
yeast
and
some
spice
aromas
taste
is
much
the
same
but
the
flavors
are
pretty
mild
overall
this
beer
has
a
lower
level
of
carbonation
with
a
slightly
crisp
and
medium
bodied
mouthfeel
overall
this
is
a
pretty
average
beer
that
is
drinkable
but
not
something
i
would
seek
out
again
drink
it
was
less
than
2
wont
be
back
to
this
one
but
wasnt
the
worst
beer
overall
tastes
better
than
it
smells
too
bitter
a
freshness
date
would
have
helped
here
from
the
12
oz
bottle
bought
at
the
foodery
in
philadelphia
o
an
easy
drinking
summer
beer
not
really
much
to
it
but
itll
get
the
job
done
enjoyable
o
a
decent
beer
probably
not
one
i
would
be
inclined
to
grab
again
though
o
as
far
as
summer
ales
go
its
not
bad
but
as
far
as
farmhouse
ales
go
its
not
very
good
one
of
flying
fishs
lessthaninteresting
brews
when
i
see
farmhouse
on
a
label
i
tend
to
think
saison
this
is
just
a
drinkable
american
ale
it
works
as
a
lawnmower
beer
for
sure
and
is
quite
nice
in
that
respect
but
the
name
is
misleading
12
oz
bottle
pours
golden
with
a
foamy
long
lasting
white
head
and
lively
carbonation
aroma
is
of
pale
malt
and
grassy
hops
body
is
medium
and
crisp
light
grassy
earthy
hops
and
biscuit
malt
fill
the
mouth
sweet
malt
gives
way
to
drying
hops
in
the
finish
nice
brew
for
a
hot
summer
day
overall
i
would
call
this
a
winner
this
is
a
good
balance
of
malts
yeast
fruits
and
hops
i
can
see
myself
drinking
more
of
this
when
the
summer
arrives
and
the
weather
turns
hot
overall
a
nice
mildly
bold
yeasty
brew
with
a
good
mix
of
flavors
creating
this
yeasty
spicy
citrusy
beer
that
is
rather
tasty
overall
a
great
brew
that
i
have
not
had
in
a
while
and
finally
got
around
to
tasting
to
grainy
and
sweet
for
pils
crispness
but
probably
one
of
the
better
summer
ales
bottle
poured
a
bright
golden
color
ale
with
a
medium
size
foamy
head
with
ok
retention
aroma
consists
of
lightly
sweet
malt
base
with
light
dry
hoppy
notes
taste
is
also
an
ok
mix
between
some
light
dry
hoppy
notes
with
a
sweet
malt
base
and
some
very
subtle
fruity
ester
body
is
average
with
good
carbonation
drinks
easily
though
lacks
character
overall
final
thoughts
even
with
the
lacking
appearance
i
would
buy
this
beer
anytime
its
perfectly
summer
to
me
its
a
sit
on
the
back
porch
and
sip
in
the
summer
evening
taking
in
the
smell
of
sun
baked
grass
and
fresh
air
great
beer
pours
a
somewhat
hazy
golden
color
with
a
very
white
very
foamy
head
that
fades
to
a
cap
lightly
sweet
and
lightly
funky
in
the
nose
pleasant
the
taste
is
similar
some
nice
fruitiness
with
notes
of
red
apple
and
pear
as
well
as
some
breadiness
a
hint
of
bitterness
and
a
little
bit
of
funk
restrained
and
very
refreshing
but
enough
interesting
flavors
to
hold
your
attention
this
is
in
no
way
an
american
blonde
ale
and
those
looking
for
such
will
be
disappointed
this
as
the
label
attests
is
a
classic
belgian
farmhouse
style
ale
call
it
a
saison
if
you
will
but
not
a
blonde
i
enjoyed
it
and
suspect
that
many
that
didnt
are
looking
for
something
more
mundane
o
very
easy
drinking
summer
beer
real
sessionable
too
overall
id
get
this
again
if
i
saw
it
on
tap
the
name
suggests
a
saison
but
in
my
opinion
it
is
far
from
anything
belgium
that
said
i
would
recommend
this
ale
and
will
serve
it
to
friends
as
a
session
beer
with
seafood
or
as
breakfast
at
the
jersey
shore
and
along
the
chesapeake
waterways
o
nice
beer
for
the
summer
but
other
than
that
nothing
else
going
on
here
i
can
see
why
it
was
the
special
for
the
night
at
2
50
a
pint
serving
type
bottle
and
on
tap
flying
fish
farmhouse
summer
ale
pours
a
brilliantly
clear
sunshine
yellow
theres
a
bit
of
wispy
white
foam
sitting
atop
the
beer
but
it
vanishes
without
a
trace
pretty
quickly
the
nose
has
some
of
grainy
sweetness
but
almost
smells
a
bit
like
some
corn
product
was
used
as
an
adjunct
theres
also
a
small
earthynoble
hop
note
to
the
aroma
the
flavor
is
almost
identical
same
grain
corn
and
hoppy
points
get
hit
on
bitterness
is
pretty
much
nonexistent
mid
palate
if
anything
id
say
the
hops
are
just
a
touch
more
present
here
to
the
beers
credit
but
its
really
not
enough
of
a
difference
that
i
can
bump
taste
up
to
the
next
score
the
body
is
surpremely
light
makes
it
very
drinkablethirst
quenching
for
the
hot
weather
the
carbonation
if
measured
in
volumes
would
probably
be
a
bit
on
the
low
side
however
when
paired
with
this
thin
and
i
say
that
with
no
negative
connotation
body
it
definitely
pops
a
little
and
adds
some
liveliness
the
great
mouthfeel
makes
me
wish
the
flavor
profile
was
a
little
more
fine
tuned
on
flying
fishs
farmhouse
summer
ale
because
i
think
then
it
would
make
close
to
an
ideal
summer
beer
overall
one
of
the
better
american
blondes
i
have
had
refreshing
hoppier
than
many
blondes
out
there
my
rating
for
this
is
based
on
my
comparisons
in
the
category
not
necessarily
to
all
beers
across
the
board
yeah
go
grab
a
few
more
a
pretty
desent
beer
spicy
and
dry
i
would
like
to
fry
this
from
a
bottle
for
comparison
purposes
because
i
can
taste
so
off
flavors
im
sure
are
tap
line
related
overall
this
is
a
pretty
good
beer
its
a
mix
of
saison
and
a
light
summer
beer
d
i
could
drink
another
but
why
would
i
not
a
bad
beer
at
all
just
nothing
here
to
hold
my
attention
12oz
bottle
from
total
wine
desert
ridge
pours
hazy
golden
color
with
white
head
i
thought
this
might
be
a
saison
but
it
doesnt
appear
to
be
once
i
opened
it
aroma
has
banana
spice
and
other
notes
that
make
this
see
a
bit
like
a
hefeweizen
maybe
a
little
apricot
there
as
well
taste
is
sweet
with
some
bitterness
on
the
end
pretty
well
balanced
medium
bodied
with
an
oily
texture
lightly
bitter
finish
a
refreshing
and
easytodrink
beer
on
a
hot
day
like
it
is
here
now
o
not
impressive
but
just
a
deviant
of
the
other
summer
seasonal
craft
offerings
out
there
this
beer
poured
out
a
yellow
color
that
was
pretty
clear
looking
the
head
was
white
and
faded
quickly
the
smell
was
kind
of
on
the
weak
side
some
malts
on
the
nose
and
just
some
light
fruity
notes
the
taste
is
kind
of
bland
wasnt
overly
thrilled
by
the
flavor
or
lack
of
one
the
mouthfeel
is
very
light
since
its
a
summer
brew
the
overall
is
that
id
probably
take
something
else
over
this
one
aroma
is
fruity
and
sweet
low
grainy
malt
aroma
somewhat
underwhelming
appearance
is
golden
and
hazy
white
head
fades
quickly
to
a
stable
thin
layer
on
top
of
the
beer
sweet
grainy
malt
dominates
the
flavor
low
hop
bitterness
just
enough
to
prevent
cloying
sweetness
some
fruity
esters
low
citrus
and
some
apple
and
pear
body
is
light
and
refreshing
with
mediumhigh
carbonation
very
drinkable
overall
annoyed
by
the
farmhouse
description
which
is
usually
associated
with
the
saison
style
good
example
of
an
american
blond
but
not
a
style
ill
return
to
very
often
overall
i
have
a
soft
spot
for
this
beer
its
not
going
to
blow
anyone
away
but
its
a
refreshing
light
flavorful
summer
beer
always
enjoyable
there
were
some
fruit
notes
in
the
taste
i
picked
up
pear
and
some
light
spice
o
not
nearly
as
bad
as
their
ipa
that
i
had
before
it
but
still
not
a
fan
overall
ill
be
honest
and
maybe
its
my
own
fault
but
i
purchased
this
assuming
i
was
getting
into
a
saison
the
word
farmhouse
in
the
title
is
generally
appealing
the
word
summer
on
the
other
hand
ive
heard
saison
yeast
can
be
tricky
to
handle
but
im
somewhat
surprised
they
just
copped
out
with
just
a
standard
english
ale
yeast
at
least
they
did
go
for
a
sour
mash
so
the
beer
is
a
tasty
blonde
yes
even
a
very
fine
summery
beer
but
id
a
bit
happier
if
they
dropped
the
word
farmhouse
from
the
label
o
this
is
a
light
beer
that
does
not
have
an
extreme
amount
of
flavor
however
it
is
a
summer
beer
this
beer
has
high
drinkability
more
to
the
point
it
is
an
easy
to
drink
beer
that
still
has
some
nice
flavor
there
is
some
fruit
mild
biscuit
and
crispness
from
the
hops
it
is
on
the
drier
side
but
the
hops
are
not
as
aggressive
as
an
ipa
or
even
a
pilsner
it
would
be
a
perfect
accompaniment
on
a
hot
summer
day
or
with
a
nice
crisp
salad
a
fresh
ale
that
ive
seen
described
as
both
a
blonde
ale
and
a
saison
pours
yellowgold
slightly
hazy
with
a
white
head
that
gets
thin
rather
quickly
grains
and
hay
in
the

grassy
with
light
floral
hops
in
the
taste
and
slight
tones
of
light
fruits
melons
and
the
like
lightmedium
mouthfeel
and
generally
pleasant
drinkability
good
for
a
session
but
not
something
id
go
for
often
overall
not
a
bad
brew
but
not
terribly
interesting
from
my
tasting
point
of
view
theres
a
little
bit
more
variety
toward
the
end
of
the
taste
but
it
would
be
nice
if
it
were
there
throughout
not
bad
but
not
good
drinkability
nice
easy

this
beer
is
alright
not
really
for
me
but
i
dont

it
is

dont
need
to
have
it
again
poured

with

that
faded
quickly
leaving
behind
a
decent
but
shortlived

smell
was
lively
lots
of
yeast
was
present
even
in
the
aroma
and
it
was
very
light
bread
and
earthy

were
the
predominant
aromas
taste
was
crisp

perfect
for
a
summer
day
very
smooth
and
full
of
bready
and
earthy
grain
tones
with
a
slight
hop
presence
as
it
warmed
overall
this
was
excellent
for
exactly
what
it
was
a
great
summer
ale
there
is
a
noticeable
bubbly
yet
smooth
feel
and
lighter
body
pretty
easy
drinking
but
not
incredibly
impressive
12oz

overall
an

nice

beer
on
a

day
a
good
summer
ale
this
beer
took
awhile
and
a
few
to
start
to
get
in
tune
with
it
also
reminds
me
much
of
their
extra
pale
ale
i
enjoy
it
out
of
a
glass
and
out
of
the
bottle
its
light
and
crisp
and
it
went
well
with
grilled
vegetables
it
may
not
astound
but
its
worth
a
try
and
surely
has
potential
appeal
to
a
wide
audience
first
sip
is
a
weird
corn
flavor
doesnt
finish
too
dry
certainly
not
like
other
saisons
that
ive
had
the
label
says
farmhouse
summer
ale
i
call
that
a
saison
and
not
an
american
blonde
no
matter
what
you
call
it
it
is
not
enjoyable
needs
a
dryer
finish
and
maybe
a
nice
crisp
hop
finish
this
seems
under
attenuated
and
corn
flavored
not
a
fan
d
i
thought
the
flavors
were
interesting
but
this
beer
was
much
too
thin
and
flat
for
my
taste
ill
have
to
try
from
a
bottlekeg
when
available
d
this
beer
has
a
very
light
and
lagered
flavor
to
it
with
no
yeast
character
or
depth
at
all
there
were
no
offensive
or
off
flavors
but
i
dont
think
i
would
work
at
their
farm
for
long
and
the
pain
train
that
is
the
leaving
falls
church
uberbender
chugs
along
this
car
pours
a
clear
golden
straw
topped
by
a
finger
of
fastdying
white
foam
the
nose
comprises
wheat
light
coriander
light
lemon
zest
graham
crackers
orange
peel
and
some
fresh
spring
flowers
the
taste
is
heavy
on
the
citrus
notes
orange
peel
lemon
zest
a
splash
of
ruby
red
grapefruit
but
they
all
blend
together
into
a
muddled
citrusy
mess
coriander
cardamom
and
a
pinch
of
nutmeg
round
things
out
on
the
tongue
the
body
is
pretty
light
with
a
light
moderate
carbonation
and
a
fairly
dry
finish
overall
a
decent
summertime
brew
for
those
seasonal
drinkers
among
us
nothing
altogether
special
but
tasty
enough
nonetheless
not
terribly
impressed
by
this
beer
though
i
was
duped
by
it
not
being
a
saisonfarmhouse
ale
just
ordered
it
randomly
appears
a
light
yellow
beer
with
a
bit
of
white
head
smell
is
faint
some
yeast
some
lemon
some
zing
to
it
but
also
a
bit
of
what
smells
like
corn
or
something
taste
is
the
same
way
crisp
clean
with
some
lemon
but
the
corny
taste
sticks
around
its
like
a
craft
version
of
a
macro
if
that
makes
sense
im
just
not
a
huge
fan
of
blonde
ales
i
guess
medium
to
light
mouthfeel
decent
carbonation
good
drinkability
if
only
because
it
was
light
and
refreshing
drinkability
though
not
enamored
on
the
taste
at
first
flying
fish
summer
proved
to
be
an
interesting
and
refreshing
beer
i
enjoyed
it
with
a
light
dinner
of
salad
and
pasta
and
it
was
good
enough
that
i
had
another
probably
one
of
the
best
summer
beers
that
i
have
had
d
overall
a
very
solid
easydrinking
beer
for
hot
humid
nights
in
southeastern
pa
medium
body
with
standard
carbonation
farmhouse
summer
ale
is
a
light
beer
that
doesnt
taste
bad
but
it
doesnt
taste
like
a
saison
either
this
beer
tastes
like
vomit
no
really
it
actually
tastes
and
smells
like
fresh
vomit
that
might
sound
rather
harsh
but
its
the
truth
i
struggled
through
one
of
these
hoping
at
some
point
my
palet
would
adjust
to
something
that
i
was
missing
but
no
it
just
kept
tasting
like
actual
vomit
i
dont
really
know
what
else
to
say
when
a
beer
tastes
this
terrible
the
appearance
and
texture
dont
really
matter
epic
failure
light
orangishyellow

thin
foamy

with
lively
carbonation
sweet
wheat
aroma
with
very
light
citrus
undertones
light
smooth
feel
with
refreshing
carbonation
the
wheat
character
is
very
dominant
again
with
very
light

flavors
very
good
refreshing
summer
ale
poured
from
a
brown
12
oz
bottle
has
a
golden
color
with
a
12
inch
head
smell
is
slightly
sweet
some
citrus
taste
is
good
hops
and
grain
well
balanced
some
citrus
feels
medium
bodied
in
the
mouth
and
has
good
drinkability
overall
this
makes
for
a
quality
beer
this
is
my
first
time
having
this
beer
but
it
is
just
plain
bad
this
is
from
notes
i
compiled
last
summer
i
poured
this
into
a
generic
pintglass
appearance
is
golden
colour
with
good
lacing
and
good
head
retention
smell
and
taste
is
a
good
amount
of
citrus
grains
spices
malts
hops
and
bread
mouthfeel
is
refreshingly
light
to
medium
bodied
and
this
is
a
very
drinkable
brew
for
those
who
like
citrus
and
need
a
fine
lawnmower
beer
d
besides
the
appearance
which
is
really
lacking
its
not
a
bad
beer
it
just
needs
some
work
the
spiciness
isnt
pronounced
or
distinguishable
its
just
there
and
the
malt
is
the
same
way
it
just
needs
some
more
character
drinkable
though
as
it
is
a
solid
sessioner
and
refresher
for
a
summer
day
had
this
on
tap
this
is
really
more
of
an
american
blond
ale
imo
its
very
good
for
that
style
but
not
so
great
for
a
saison
so
ill
rate
it
as
a
hybrid
of
sorts
pours
a
clear
golden
color
with
a
fluffy
white
head
and
decent
lacing
aroma
is
wheat
citrus
light
spice
and
grain
flavor
is
wheat
pale
malt
grain
citrus
and
light
fruits
palate
is
clean
and
crisp
with
fairly
light
body
and
medium
carbonation
drinkability
is
high
since
this
is
so
light
with
somewhat
mild
flavors
finally
let
me
say
it
again
if
youre
looking
for
a
truetostyle
saison
this
is
not
the
beer
for
you
if
you
just
mowed
the
lawn
on
a
90
degree
day
sure
itll
work
in
my
opinion
the
name
is
very
deceiving
in
that
no
mention
should
be
made
of
farmhouse
ale
this
beer
is
nothing
more
than
a
simple
summer
beer
the
mere
implication
that
it
had
any
of
the
complexity
inherent
in
a
saisonfarmhouse
got
me
angry
in
that
vein
its
drinkability
is
great
on
a
hot
day
the
aroma
and
flavor
were
lacking
for
even
that
style
of
beer
very
lightcolored
and
carbonated
but
no
head
sorry
that
this
review
isnt
a
little
more
detailed
but
i
was
very
annoyed
after
my
first
snifftaste
if
you
want
a
topnotch
refreshing
ale
made
by
flying
fish
to
drink
in
the
summertime
rush
out
and
get
some
limited
edition
exit
11
american
wheat
ale
before
its
all
gone
its
outstanding
and
puts
this
socalled
farmhouse
ale
to
shame
i
thought
this
was
a
summer
beer
and
not
a
farmhouse
ale
i
liked
it
when
i
had
it
and
now
see
why
it
was
more
interesting
than
i
expected
very
light
color
average
smell
ok
taste
but
as
a
regular
summer
beer
mouthfeel
and
drinkability
are
good
and
worth
getting
if
youre
hot
and
thirsty
i
found
this
beer
to
be
one
of
the
easiestdrinking
beers
ive
ever
had
now
my
review
is
flawed
because
i
dont
believe
i
have
any
other
saisonfarmhouse
ales
to
compare
it
to
this
is
my
first
but
from
the
description
of
the
style
i
expected
something
a
bit
more
complex
in
flavor
and
this
was
not
complex
at
all
low
abv
combined
with
a
mellow
flavor
equals
very
easy
drinkability
for
an
every
day
summer
beer
id
choose
this
hands
down
over
the
bmc
beers
unfortunately
this
runs
32
a
case
so
it
could
be
come
an
expensive
habit
i
may
have
to
just
fit
it
in
here
and
there
over
the
summer
overall
a
nice
drinkable
farmhouse
ale
that
carries
a
nice
hop
bite
to
it
very
satisfying
and
refreshing
i
would
drink
anytime
during
the
summer
i
really
enjoyed
it
on
tap
pours
clear
gold
with
a
small
fizzy
white
head
that
disappears
instantly
and
leaves
no
trace
smells
incredibly
faint
light
malt
with
some
light
fruit
a
bit
floral
but
thats
a
reach
tastes
of
tangy
wheat
and
sugary
sweetness
littleno
hop
presence
save
for
a
hint
at
the
finish
light
fizzy
feel
this
doesnt
even
bare
a
passing
resemblance
to
a
proper
saison
on
top
of
that
its
too
sweet
to
enjoy
this
is
a
good
farmhouse
summer
ale
easy
to
drink
during
thoughs
hot
dayswell
worth
buying
again
da
nice
hot
weather
session
saison
and
an
interesting
one
because
of
the
filtration
process
under
5
and
enough
flavor
to
hold
up
with
a
light
lunch
or
sitting
in
a
coller
by
the
pool
d
overall
i
feel
it
is
kind
of
low
it
isnt
offensive
just
not
quite
as
drinkable
as
some
of
the
other
domestic
and
imported
varieties
ive
had
definitely
did
not
have
any
of
the
high
points
i
associate
with
a
saisonmuch
more
of
an
american
pale
ale
but
average
for
that
style
wouldnt
seek
it
out
but
might
recommend
it
to
friends
who
like
light
quaffable
ales
d
says
its
a
quenching
summer
beer
cant
say
i
disagree
nothing
outrageous
here
but
fine
for
what
it
aims
for
nothing
too
spectacular
here
would
drink
it
over
most
domestics
but
nothing
to
get
excited
over
mda
fizzydry
mouthfeel
and
an
easy
drink
not
my
favorite
beer
in
the
world
but
id
suggest
that
anyone
give
this
one
a
try
if
you
have
the
opportunity
much
lighter
body
than
expected
for
the
style
but
still
smooth
pretty
easy
to
drink
overall
the
score
probably
suffered
a
little
due
to
when
i
was
drinking
it
i
thought
it
was
a
pale
ale
or
a
pale
wheat
ale
but
overall
not
a
bad
beer
i
would
probably
order
again
highly
drinkable
with
a
thin
mouthfeel
and
almost
sour
apple
taste
very
refreshing
and
could
easily
put
away
a
few
of
these
in
one
sitting
excellent
summer
beer
to
kill
some
time
with
mouthfeel
is
a
little
watered
down
light
but
clean
not
a
great
farmhouse
but
not
aweful
the
beer
is
very
drinkable
could
easily
go
through
several
in
a
night
a
good
refreshing
beer
for
a
hot
summer
day
you
can
certainly
tell
the
difference
with
this
being
filtered
i
prefer
the
unfiltered
offerings
of
this
beer
style
hennepin
is
the
best
but
this
is
good
as
a
different
take
on
it
at
4
6
abv
the
mild
and
refreshing
flavor
makes
this
a
great
choice
for
a
session
beer
the
apple
taste
might
get
to
me
after
awhile
and
its
not
much
to
look
at
but
this
is
an
easy
drinker
drinkability
this
is
surprisingly
easy
to
drink
i
could
down
several
if
i
wanted
a
mildly
favored
beer
to
have
several
pints
d
a
light
drinking
summer
that
goes
down
with
barely
a
second
thought
worthy
of
a
try
this
isnt
the
best
saisonfarmhouse
style
ale
however
it
is
very
complex
and
a
nice
change
from
other
summer
seasonals
and
clocking
in
at
a
sessionable
abv
i
cant
find
anything
to
complain
about
pours
a
nice
golden
copper
with
a
nice
retaining
head
smell
is
floral
hoppy
and
grainy
drinks
crisply
and
smoothly
not
quite
with
a
snap
but
almost
hints
of
coriander
lemon
and
orange
abound
but
neither
are
in
the
spotlight
low
in
alchohol
means
that
this
is
a
quality
summertime
picnic
beer
that
youll
empty
quite
quickly
md
this
one
is
very
drinkable
but
not
necessarily
in
a
good
way
it
wasnt
overwhelming
in
taste
so
you
could
drink
many
and
not
be
overpowered
overall
very
watery
and
the
flavor
is
very
weak
i
thought
it
would
have
lost
a
ton
of
flavor
and
character
being
filtered
and
such
but
this
ended
up
being
a
pretty
solid
farmhouse
ale
on
the
light
side
but
it
makes
up
for
that
with
its
superb
drinkability
d
easy
drinking
and
enjoyable
a
very
good
sessionable
beer
a
slight
departure
from
the
typical
summer
brew
which
is
greatly
appreciated
nothing
great
nothing
bad
about
this
beer
definitely
a
session
beer
that
one
could
put
away
without
thinking
about
it
very
drinkable
easy
to
reach
for
another
sip
d
this
was
okay
overall
just
a
bit
bland
do
drinkability
is
quite
good
for
this
beer
despite
its
flaws
and
straying
from
a
true
saison
my
summer
party
guests
enjoyed
it
immensely
but
i
was
let
down
with
the
bottled
version
after
having
had
it
on
tap
during
philly
beer
week
my
recollections
were
of
a
beer
that
had
much
more
crispness
sweetness
and
bite
what
came
in
the
bottle
was
just
a
bit
simple
for
my
tastes
im
hoping
i
just
got
a
bad
run
and
ill
probably
give
this
another
try
next
summer
id
call
this
beer
a
small
saison
as
the
body
and
flavor
are
considerably
lighter
than
the
heavy
hitters
of
the
saison
style
still
it
has
a
pleasant
and
crisp
body
with
mild
biscuit
malts
and
a
smattering
of
hops
and
belgian
spice
a
simple
but
tasty
summer
beer
id
take
this
over
sam
adams
summer
ale
on
a
hot
day
flying
fish
summer
ale
not
too
much
to
say
tastes
like
sam
adams
summer
ale
not
a
compliment
pours
a
pale
yellow
that
screams
ale
the
appearance
is
not
pleasing
and
there
is
almost
no
head
on
the
beer
i
cant
say
it
doesnt
taste
good
it
does
it
is
a
refreshing
summer
beer
flying
fish
could
do
much
better
and
should
from
a
company
that
puts
out
quality
beer
the
bar
needs
to
be
upped
for
an
ale
light
crisp
refreshing
with
a
husky
grain
flavor
and
citrus
hop
bitterness
not
quite
as
lemony
as
some
other
summer
beers
a
subtle
coriander
spice
is
present
along
with
a
somewhat
bitter
finish
overall
a
really
nice
drinkable
summer
beer
the
beer
is
clear
golden
with
a
decent
white
head
very
light
in
the
aroma
with
some
wafting
grain
huskiness
and
hops
very
light
on
the
palate
with
a
light
flavor
grainy
slightly
acidic
with
slight
bitterness
at
the
end
light
and
refreshing
almost
too
light
i
find
little
resemblance
to
traditional
saisons
so
i
am
not
sure
why
they
use
the
farmhouse
ale
moniker
it
pours
absolutely
beautiful
light
yellow
with
a
vast
enduring
billowy
head
that
dissolves
slowly
to
tremendous
lacing
it
has
however
almost
no
aroma
the
main
flaw
for
this
beer
the
flavor
is
lemony
and
slightly
and
pleasantly
sour
with
a
little
hint
of
bitterness
the
mouthfeel
is
thin
and
refreshing
this
is
a
highly
drinkable
if
somewhat
unusual
summer
session
beer
d
a
bit
watery
but
fresh
tasting
doesnt
quite
satisfy
like
i
was
hoping
it
would
drinkable
but
could
be
improved
overalla
very
dissapointing
beer
that
i
will
never
purchase
again
i
was
also
not
pleased
to
see
this
was
contract
brewed
at
matts
brewing
the
beer
pours
a
yellowish
gold
color
with
pretty
persistent
head
retention
and
modest
lacing
the
nose
is
pretty
close
to
nonexistent
with
none
of
the
spice
andor
funk
one
would
normally
associate
with
a
belgium
saison
if
anything
i
get
a
very
light
aroma
of
hoppy
bitterness
on
the
palate
this
beer
is
very
light
and
crisp
i
guess
one
might
call
it
refreshing
except
that
its
so
light
watery
and
insipid
i
really
had
no
interest
in
finishing
off
my
10
ounce
glass
of
the
stuff
while
i
give
flying
fish
points
for
keeping
the
abv
down
in
this
case
they
clearly
did
so
at
the
expense
of
having
much
flavor
at
least
imo
this
is
not
a
beer
that
would
hold
any
interest
for
me
in
the
future
certainly
not
the
best
depiction
of
the
style
m
d
mouthfeel
is
carbonated
bubbly
but
thin
thickens
as
it
warms
this
beer
would
be
nice
to
drink
on
a
hot
summer
day
especially
when
its
cold
as
it
warms
it
becomes
an
okay
sipping
beer
not
bad
but
didnt
blow
me
away
it
was
my
first
rating
of
a
farmhouse
so
im
eager
to
see
what
else
is
out
there
in
this
style
pours
a
clear
gold
crème
head
nose
is
bland
flavor
is
bitter
no
saison
qualities
at
all
basically
tastes
like
a
metallic
toned
lager
massive
metallic
aftertaste
feel
is
not
saison
like
at
all
thin
and
watery
on
the
liquid
if
this
is
a
saison
then
i
have
three
feet
a
complete
miss
of
the
mark
imo
that
holds
no
qualities
that
the
well
known
saisons
do
i
didnt
enjoy
it
at
all
and
ended
up
dumping
the
majority
of
it
golden
colored
ale
with
a
malt
aroma
to
it
taste
is
malt
maybe
a
bit
of
wheat
and
a
smidge
of
citrus
there
is
nothing
remarkable
or
offensive
in
this
ale
its
freshsmooth
and
drinkable
a
perfect
beer
for
a
hot
humid
dayi
will
buy
again
only
on
the
warm
weather
months
though
an
easy
drinking
brew
not
hard
to
take
with
a
relatively
low
abv
poured
a
clear
gold
color
with
minimal
head
that
left
very
little
lacing
aroma
is
generally
weak
but
pleasant
a
pleasant
funkiness
dominates
with
some
wheat
corn
yeast
and
just
a
bit
of
fruitiness
taste
is
like
the
smell
in
that
it
is
also
fairly
weak
a
bit
spicy
at
first
with
a
wheat
backbone
between
the
initial
taste
and
the
finish
there
is
a
bit
of
dead
space
all
i
can
really
detect
here
is
a
light
wheat
flavor
the
finish
is
a
mix
of
bitterness
from
the
hops
and
a
bit
of
that
typical
farmhouse
funkiness
mouthfeel
is
well
average
at
best
despite
the
lack
of
a
head
this
brew
seems
moderately
carbonated
with
a
lightmedium
body
that
is
certainly
more
towards
the
light
end
of
the
spectrum
drinkability
is
pretty
good
its
crisp
and
fairly
refreshing
but
a
little
subdued
for
my
tastes
i
think
id
like
this
brew
better
if
the
flavors
and
aromas
were
more
assertive
recommended
drinkability
refreshing
hot
weather
alternative
with
a
balanced
malt
fruity
and
slightly
herbaceous
character
it
is
a
real
stretch
to
consider
this
among
other
saisons
however
enjoy
it
for
what
it
is
the
mouthfeel
is
medium
bodied
some
carbonation
bite
clean
on
the
palate
drinkable
no
overwhelming
flavors
here
yet
enough
to
keep
you
interested
very
sessionable
brew
that
said
i
cant
see
myself
spending
money
on
this
one
again
but
its
cheap
pretty
wellcrafted
and
extremely
drinkable
this
saison
is
at
the
very
lightest
end
of
the
spectrum
for
the
style
its
easily
drinkable
but
really
lacks
the
depth
and
complexity
of
a
true
saison
lawnmower
beer
a
very
light
saison
i
prefer
the
stronger
versions
it
is
drinkable
but
light
for
the
style
i
bought
a
case
of
this
brew
after
trying
one
in
lakewood
nj
on
a
business
trip
they
have
a
great
logo
and
an
attractive
label
there
was
no
freshness
date
to
be
found
anywhere
on
the
bottle
this
is
a
very
tasty
and
enjoyable
beer
it
poured
a
clean
and
clear
golden
yellow
to
golden
orange
color
very
clear
and
golden
yellow
when
back
lit
there
was
almost
perfect
carbonation
bubbling
up
from
the
bottom
nice
two
finger
head
with
a
rough
pour
there
is
a
strong
lacing
down
the
glass
and
nice
head
retention
it
still
had
at
least
a
quarter
inch
of
head
34
of
the
way
down
the
glass
smell
is
light
and
airy
with
a
slight
hint
of
spice
it
certainly
has
some
pale
malt
and
a
dough
like
scent
mixed
in
the
nose
perhaps
some
mild
clove
and
some
sweetness
as
well
maybe
some
pineapple
and
banana
tones
there
is
a
slight
tang
or
sour
note
in
there
too
the
taste
is
smooth
and
very
easy
to
drink
there
is
a
taste
of
pale
malt
with
a
nice
dry
flavor
in
the
beginning
of
the
taste
no
real
sweetness
found
on
the
pallet
the
dryness
gives
way
to
a
nice
spice
flavor
with
some
slight
bitterness
subtle
hop
oil
lingers
in
the
back
ground
the
finish
also
lends
itself
toward
the
dry
side
very
nice
mouth
feel
and
a
great
taste
i
wish
i
could
find
this
beer
further
north
but
i
think
it
pretty
much
stays
in
nj
i
have
found
another
great
summer
treat
and
it
certainly
fits
in
my
book
as
a
great
session
brew
nice
offering
from
flying
fish
and
i
would
seek
this
brew
out
again
for
sure
smooth
mouthfeel
is
followed
by
a
blast
of
sweet
orange
citrus
and
a
touch
of
bubblegum
finish
is
dry
and
slightly
herbal
this
is
a
decent
beer
but
not
a
saison
lacking
in
complexity
and
funkiness
that
ive
come
to
expect
in
my
saisons
d
a
refreshing
summer
ale
not
really
like
other
saison
beers
ive
had
but
a
decent
warm
weather
drink
overall
an
easy
drinking
saison
a
very
toned
down
specimen
in
my
opinion
this
beer
was
pretty
good
overall
a
light
golden
color
body
kind
of
reminded
me
of
white
grape
juice
with
no
head
but
a
decent
lacing
not
too
much
of
a
discernable
smell
hints
of
malts
were
evident
the
taste
was
pretty
crisp
with
nice
malty
undertones
that
made
the
beer
appear
to
be
really
light
the
mouthfeel
was
pretty
average
a
little
on
the
thin
side
but
good
for
a
saison
the
beer
overall
is
pretty
light
and
surprisingly
refreshing
definitely
a
good
call
on
a
hot
summer
day
when
your
only
other
alternative
is
a
past
dated
winter
warmer
i
definitely
will
be
drinking
this
beer
as
the
late
spring
and
summer
months
approach
beer
pours
golden
in
color
bubbles
quickly
and
constantly
flowing
to
the
top
mild
aroma
primarily
malt
and
a
little
hoppy
taste
is
definitely
malty
and
heavily
carbonated
the
carbonation
takes
away
from
any
real
discernable
flavor
although
there
is
a
hint
of
hop
flavor
in
there
very
dry
aftertaste
but
i
can
see
this
as
a
very
easy
beer
to
drink
on
a
hot
afternoon
ontap
into
a
pint
glass
pours
a
light
yellowstraw
slightly
foggy
color
no
real
head
no
lacing
nose
is
nice
light
and
crisp
hops
with
a
little
hint
of
malt
nothing
overwhelming
but
tasty
taste
is
a
little
weak
crisp
but
not
strong
a
little
floral
hops
and
some
quiet
malt
feel
is
standard
good
carbonation
drinkability
is
okay
its
an
alright
beer
certainly
not
a
good
saison
i
didnt
even
realize
it
was
supposed
to
be
this
style
while
drinking
it
but
not
one
i
would
necessarily
throw
out
either
poured
out
a
nice
golden
color
with
a
big
lacing
off
white
head
the
nose
offered
floral
hops
some
citrus
and
tineiest
amount
of
spice
nearly
nonexistent
this
drinks
very
easy
again
with
floral
hops
leading
the
way
some
bitterness
tiny
amount
of
malt
and
not
much
else
a
crisp
mouthfeel
and
some
bitter
hops
lingering
on
the
palate
not
what
im
looking
for
out
of
a
saison
styled
beer
but
on
its
own
a
decent
easy
drinking
beer
cheers
my
first
impression
of
this
beer
was
that
it
was
just
another
cheap
macro
brew
all
of
the
constituent
elements
were
there
dry
ashy
yeast
corn
fruity
sourness
but
then
i
realized
that
these
flavors
were
really
well
put
together
the
way
the
flavors
played
off
of
each
other
was
what
i
had
been
wishing
your
average
bmc
swill
tasted
like
i
could
be
silly
and
call
it
the
grandhigh
emperor
of
bmc
seriously
though
this
was
really
well
done
for
what
it
is
and
really
easy
to
drink
as
far
as
saisons
go
ive
had
better
but
this
beers
originality
really
impressed
me
pours
a
clear
golden
color
with
a
foamy
head
that
didnt
stick
around
too
long
not
much
of
an
aroma
grassy
hints
but
thats
about
it
some
wheat
notes
in
the
taste
but
other
than
that
almost
too
light
its
drinkable
in
the
sense
that
it
goes
down
smooth
but
dont
expect
anything
special
its
not
bad
just
a
very
bland
summer
ale
drinkability
is
alright
i
know
ff
keeps
this
drinkable
for
the
masses
one
of
my
old
neighbors
knew
i
was
heavily
into
craft
brews
and
she
brought
me
up
a
few
bottles
a
couple
of
years
ago
she
described
it
like
a
lighter
hefe
weizen
she
didnt
know
much
about
beer
but
something
prompted
her
to
buy
a
case
of
it
to
me
this
would
be
more
of
an
american
ale
than
a
saison
fellas
need
to
make
money
though
maybe
we
could
get
a
farmhouse
roots
version
of
ff
sometime
soon
in
the
big
corkedcaged
bottles
where
they
use
the
same
recipe
but
a
saison
yeast
the
taste
has
some
lemony
bitterness
up
front
from
the
hops
followed
by
a
good
sweet
malt
presence
with
some
biscuit
flavour
the
finish
is
quite
dry
unusual
tasting
beer
and
im
glad
i
got
to
try
it
thanks
to
jwc215
this
was
a
decent
if
uninspiring
brew
doesnt
do
much
on
the
nose
and
the
taste
is
a
bit
thin
it
is
highly
drinkable
though
with
a
bit
of
a
lemony
flavor
it
goes
down
easy
on
a
hot
day
which
is
the
point
of
a
summer
ale
i
suppose
not
sure
its
really
much
of
a
saison
but
its
not
bad
for
what
it
is
once
i
have
more
of
flying
fishs
offerings
i
could
possibly
pinpoint
a
trend
or
two
among
its
portfolio
of
beers
there
wasnt
anything
wrong
or
unenjoyable
about
this
but
this
is
not
the
beer
one
should
delve
into
when
learning
about
saisons
for
the
summer
or
a
hot
afternoon
itll
hold
up
alright
but
i
would
love
to
see
this
redone
for
next
year
more
true
to
form
the
body
is
a
clear
brownyellow
with
little
head
just
a
ring
nose
is
nothing
more
than
a
little
grain
tastes
of
light
grain
citrus
possibly
a
wheat
twang
and
various
spices
i
cant
id
the
mouthfeel
is
medium
and
tingly
from
the
high
carbonation
this
beer
is
refreshing
but
too
light
and
simple
overall
bland
what
smoothness
there
was
came
more
from
thinness
than
anything
else
while
not
awful
and
i
had
two
or
three
and
will
be
able
to
eventually
finish
the
6pack
or
find
someone
to
help
me
do
so
its
blandness
and
aftertaste
would
not
have
me
choose
this
again
for
a
summer
brew
not
satisfying
smooth
even
if
spicy
great
drinking
good
character
not
a
bad
stab
at
a
saison
in
the
least
not
bad
at
all
had
this
on
tap
at
antones
it
was
served
in
a
shaker
pint
glass
kind
of
ruins
the
affect
since
the
name
says
farmhouse
i
had
expected
a
typical
saison
i
didnt
get
it
not
much
in
the
way
of
a
typical
saison
aroma
not
much
yeast
or
grass
or
spiceness
i
read
one
review
that
called
in
a
blond
ale
kind
of
a
plain
beer
not
a
good
example
of
a
saison
but
it
is
a
beer
one
could
drink
during
a
summer
afternoon
drinkability
the
beer
has
a
decent
drinkability
with
no
true
flaws
i
might
have
scored
it
higher
if
it
was
marketed
as
a
blond
ale
it
clearly
did
not
have
the
characteristics
of
a
saison
and
was
not
stylistically
close
to
anything
like
hennepin
or
saison
dupont
i
actually
asked
the
waiter
if
he
accidentally
brought
me
some
other
beer
because
i
was
expecting
so
much
more
the
color
of
this
beer
was
clear
gold
with
a
small
white
head
that
quickly
disappeared
there
was
some
lemon
in
the
smell
with
a
slight
spiciness
but
all
the
smells
were
very
faint
the
flavor
is
dominated
by
peppery
spice
with
a
hint
of
lemon
tartness
with
decent
malt
sweetness
in
the
background
the
mouthfeel
is
biting
from
the
carbonation
and
the
spiciness
overall
this
is
an
ok
beer
sour
and
spicy
and
refreshing
overall
this
is
not
a
good
saison
but
more
of
a
average
pale
ale
ive
tried
this
brew
with
several
types
of
foods
nothing
seems
to
bring
out
any
flavors
with
that
said
this
is
a
drinkable
brew
overall
a
pretty
good
beer
and
one
i
would
love
to
have
when
the
hot
weather
returns
pleasant
darker
golden
color
lots
of
malt
in
the
nose
the
taste
is
pretty
solid
at
first
sip
it
seems
like
it
is
going
to
be
too
carbonated
but
it
smooths
out
considerably
at
the
finish
the
saison
yeast
is
less
noticeable
in
this
beer
than
in
other
saisons
i
have
had
to
me
thats
a
good
thing
a
nicely
crisp
and
refreshing
beer
i
would
like
to
try
it
again
next
summer
poured
a
slightly
hazy
medium
amber
color
with
magnificient
white
puffy
head
that
was
easily
revived
with
a
light
swirl
smell
is
very
mild
with
some
fruitiness
citrus
and
a
bit
of
spiciness
taste
is
a
good
combination
of
a
hoppy
bitterness
fruity
malt
and
nice
background
spiciness
finish
is
very
light
and
dry
a
very
easy
to
drink
beer
that
would
bewonderful
on
a
warm
spring
day
pours
a
nice
looking
golden
yellow
with
a
large
frothy
white
head
and
a
little
lacing
nose
is
a
very
faint
floral
note
with
a
slight
bit
of
lemon
taste
is
a
slightly
sweet
lemony
malt
with
balanced
by
a
small
dose
of
floral
hops
this
doesnt
have
any
of
the
spiciness
or
the
slight
tartness
ive
come
to
expect
of
saisons
mouthfeel
is
thin
and
very
carbonated
this
is
a
rather
mediocre
offering
that
isnt
a
good
example
of
the
style
at
all
super
carbonated
whole
lot
of
head
color
was
a
pale
pale
yellowperhaps
even
lighter
than
some
pilsners
nose
was
oddmalts
with
an
attempt
at
spices
but
such
a
menagerie
of
spices
i
cannot
even
begin
to
place
them
in
terms
of
taste
i
am
not
sure
whether
this
is
truly
a
saison
very
light
and
crisp
with
somewhat
of
a
dry
finish
also
like
the
aroma
the
flavor
is
so
mushed
togeterh
i
cannot
honestly
place
much
of
anything
other
than
some
slightly
sweet
malts
and
a
light
layer
of
bittering
hops
there
is
some
other
flavors
present
but
they
are
so
blended
into
each
other
i
cannot
place
them
for
me
just
not
a
very
interesting
beer
bottle
is
the
standard
12oz
brown
bottle
with
no
freshness
date
or
any
other
information
i
like
labels
to
be
a
little
more
informative
pours
a
goldened
straw
color
with
a
3
finger
head
taht
falls
to
a
light
coating
over
top
the
nose
is
peppery
spice
overlaying
a
light
sweet
and
lemoney
base
i
cant
put
my
finger
on
the
sweetness
its
somewhat
floral
the
flavor
is
a
little
light
comparted
to
the
nose
the
lemoney
floral
component
is
most
dominant
with
the
light
peppery
spice
playing
second
string
i
get
a
light
metallic
twinge
on
the
finish
the
feel
is
moderate
to
thick
with
a
moderate
carbonation
maybe
a
touch
too
thick
for
me
id
like
a
litte
drying
on
the
finish
too
the
drinkability
is
very
good
its
a
refreshing
and
crisp
brew
the
flavor
is
nice
no
real
flaws
just
lacking
anything
to
make
it
stand
out
overalla
rather
lightweight
version
of
the
saison
from
flying
fish
but
its
a
nice
lazy
summer
brew
to
kick
back
on
and
its
so
easygoing
that
its
hard
to
be
dissapointed
decent
brew
spicy
and
refreshing
but
not
really
that
substantial
still
a
very
solid
example
of
the
style
and
another
decent
brew
from
flying
fish
recommended
pours
a
pale
strawyellow
color
with
a
big
white
head
that
leaces
nice
lacing
down
the
glass
smell
is
an
earthy
grassy
straw
smell
with
a
hint
of
spiciness
like
corriander
or
clove
the
taste
is
grassy
and
strawlike
malt
with
a
cloying
spiciness
from
maybe
saaz
hops
that
has
hints
of
corrainder
a
pretty
basic
saison
but
a
good
summertime
brew
thats
crisp
and
refreshing
but
nothing
extraordinary
or
exciting
drinkability
would
be
a
good
beer
to
accompany
a
greek
or
italian
meal
nose
was
nice
inviting
crisp
citrus
tones
pulled
you
in
initial
the
play
is
even
with
malts
hops
then
the
hops
reign
and
invite
the
citrus
currents
to
dance
on
the
pallete
the
brew
continues
to
build
and
peak
on
the
throat
with
sharper
tones
and
hops
swallowing
very
clean
and
crisp
with
a
likewise
aftertaste
an
excellent
summer
brew
that
would
pair
nicely
with
a
variety
of
foods
i
would
definitely
recommend
it
as
a
early
session
offering
or
with
lunchdinner
or
by
its
lonesome
beer
is
good
happy
beering
the
one
thing
i
didnt
like
as
much
the
overly
alive
feeling
in
the
mouth
is
the
thing
that
goes
along
with
the
zesty
flavor
to
make
this
one
very
drinkable
beer
a
little
bit
of
a
dichotomy
there
but
one
that
benefits
it
when
it
comes
time
to
choose
which
beer
to
drink
this
is
absolutely
a
great
lawnmower
beer
but
i
think
the
cask
has
something
to
do
with
that
as
the
bottle
is
not
in
this
league
a
shame
really
that
i
cant
keep
a
cask
on
my
deck
for
after
my
yardwork
this
in
no
way
stands
up
to
any
of
the
saisons
coming
out
of
belgium
my
advice
to
this
brewer
is
to
leave
it
to
the
belgians
to
do
what
they
do
best
and
that
is
brew
great
beer
this
had
hardly
any
flavor
to
it
and
what
was
there
was
straw
and
corn
no
good
farmhouse
flavors
in
any
way
and
no
old
world
quality
to
it
not
good
drinkability
is
solid
again
heavy
end
of
style
very
intersting
but
not
distinctive
pours
a
very
pale
gold
with
minimal
head
aroma
is
of
citrus
and
a
bit
of
wheat
notes
taste
is
smooth
not
really
a
saison
in
my
opinion
wheat
beer
clove
and
spice
notes
with
citrus
nice
hop
finish
at
the
end
mouthfeel
is
nice
and
smooth
overall
this
is
a
very
easy
drinking
beer
would
make
a
nice
session
beer
in
the
summer
not
really
to
style
as
it
lacks
the
funkiness
of
a
true
saison
the
beer
pours
a
hazy
pale
gold
color
with
a
thick
frothy
white
head
that
quickly
fades
to
lacing
the
aroma
is
good
it
has
a
pale
malt
scent
that
is
fruity
to
the
nose
and
has
hints
of
wheat
there
seems
to
be
a
bit
of
spice
as
well
very
nice
the
taste
is
good
also
it
has
a
grainy
pale
malt
flavor
that
boasts
also
of
wheat
and
a
fruity
yeast
finish
it
goes
down
with
ease
and
finishes
a
bit
tart
and
fruity
the
mouthfeel
is
good
it
is
a
low
bodied
beer
with
good
carbonation
this
is
a
fine
saison
its
not
the
best
ive
tried
but
it
drinks
well
nice
deep
golden
color
with
a
nice
14
inch
head
atop
it
malty
aromanot
as
much
as
i
remember
when
i
first
had
this
a
few
years
back
the
overwhelming
earthiness
and
bready
qualities
that
i
loved
in
it
are
gone
as
well
great
malty
flavor
with
a
slight
hop
bitterness
some
very
nice
residual
yeastiness
in
the
backround
very
smooth
on
the
palatenicely
built
for
only
a
4
6
beer
i
could
seriously
drink
this
all
night
no
matter
what
the
season
its
pretty
far
from
a
saison
for
sure
but
on
its
own
merits
its
quite
the
excellent
brew
this
was
served
from
the
tap
as
a
light
yellow
color
with
very
little
head
there
was
a
citrus
scent
to
the
the
nose
and
a
definite
lemon
flavor
in
the
mouth
it
had
a
dry
mouthfell
which
enhanced
its
drinkability
since
each
swallow
left
me
thirsty
for
another
the
lemon
flavor
continued
to
linger
after
the
finish
which
makes
this
a
good
choice
as
a
summer
seasonal
it
feels
thin
in
the
mouth
but
is
cleansing
i
had
one
and
said
enough
drinkabilitynoes
nice
but
nothing
outstanding
would
i
have
a
couple
yes
but
there
needs
to
be
something
here
that
isnt
expected
a
little
more
out
of
the
flying
fish
folks
additionally
i
was
disappointed
with
the
presentation
the
label
was
very
generic
i
was
forced
to
buy
it
from
a
questionable
place
and
would
have
like
some
sort
of
freshness
label
or
at
least
a
year

very
old

have
been
on
a
brewery
tour
at

know
their
process
to
be
heavily
filtered

through
alot
in
this

flavors
of

mix
with
a

yeasty
fruitiness
then
flowery
hoppy
bitterness
rounds
things
out
just
right
lively
carbonation
on
the
tongue
finishes
bitter
with
some
dryness
on
the
palate
a
great
session
ale
due
to
its
low
alcohol
content
overall
too
weak
too
watery
and
what
little
taste
wasnt
that
pleasant
not
horrible
but
not
worth
drinking
my
summer
wont
be
wasted
on
this
sorry
flying

golden

subsiding

leaving
suggestions
of

mostly
clear

hardly
noticeable
with

somewhere
in
there
body

good
and

sweetness
up

not
that
of

with
orange
sweetness
developing
on
the
way
down
clean
finish
not
too
much
character
here
but
very
refreshing
and
easy
to
drink
a
very
good
summer
beer
which
is
somewhere
between
gold
and
amber
a
ok
head
but
a
nice
lace
that
made
up
for
it
a
good
smell
the
taste
has
a
nice
spiciness
to
it
aking
to
their
grand
cru
this
is
pretty
much
a
lighter
more
drinkable
version
of
that
they
dont
seem
to
be
using
the
same
yeast
strain
which
produced
all
those
zesty
esters
in
the
grand

this
is
refreshing
and

to
it
kudos
to
flying
fish
for
actually
making
a
summer
ale
with
some
flavor
other
than
lemon
overall
i
really
enjoyed
this
offering
delicate
at
times
but
very
accomplished
thanks
to
nerofiddled
for
the
sample
light
carbonation
crispness
low
sweetness
and
excellent
clarity
slight
chill
haze
i
liked
it
more
than
i
would
have
if
they
had
rigorously
nailed
the
saison
style
great
to
have
while
cooking
and
eating
some
barbecued
chicken
a
daytoday
saison
to
me
it
was
what
a
lager
should
taste
like
but
with
more
raw
flavors
of
course
drinkable
but
not
the
glory
of
a
dupont
or
hennepin
overall
impression
a
great
saison
usually
a
hit
or
miss
in
the
us
this
is
the
first
beer
ive
tried
from
this
brewery
probably
my
favorite
of
the
19
i
tried
at
the
festival
if
the
rest
of
ffbs
beers
are
this
good
a
light
yellowish
colored
ale
that
a
pour
develops
a
slight
head
not
one
of
the
better
looking
beers
but
it
is
extremely
drinkable
as
light
citrus
and
wheat
flavors
are
well
balanced
little
to
no
aftertaste
more
than
one
can
be
quaffed
without
getting
bored
this
ale
has
become
one
of
my
summertime
staples
in
the
refridgerator
based
on
taste
and
reasonable
price
another
above
averagegood
offering
from
flying
fish
still
havent
seen
them
achieve
greatness
yet
but
they
are
a
solid
brewery
overall
pours
a
hazy
yellowgold
witha
surprisingly
strong
head
which
dissolves
rather
quicjly
leaving
a
bit
of
lace
throughout
just
the
right
amount
of
carbonation
here
i
thought
smells
mainly
of
citrus
but
hints
of
spice
come
out
as
well
the
spices
are
a
bit
more
pronounced
in
the
flavour
but
citrus
still
dominates
here
along
with
the
expected
wheatiness
of
a
summer
brew
again
not
a
bad
brew
overall
id
say
its
a
middle
of
the
road
summer
micro
pretty
straightforward
nothing
daring

not

from

which
is
what
i
was
looking
for

a

taste
isnt

take
control
of
the

herbal
like
also
some
lemon
notes
malt
is
in
the
background
but
mixes
in
to
offer
some
balance
to
the
spiciness
overall
this
is
definitely
an
interesting
beer
worth
a
try
had
a
pleasant
grassy
hop
aroma
this
was
much
creamier
smoother
and
had
more
body
than
the
regular
draft
version
very
flavorful
an
excellent
summer
sipper
this
has
pretty
much
all
the
flavors
of
a
good
summer
ale
making
me
yearn
for
some
warmer
weather
lemon
wheat
and
a
light
maltiness

in

slightly

this

brew

easy
to
drink

ranks

the

a
gentle

sweetness
thats
well

by

a

i

this

i

this
one
is
enjoyable
light

very

like
a

a
nice
little

that
adds
to
the
overall
experience
no
overbearing
or
complex
tastes
but
for
the
style
and
what
little
i
know
of
the
style
this
seems
pretty
good
to
me
a
bit
similar
to
a
good
kolsch
excellent

seasonal
great
taste
and

a
good
summer
beer
not
my
favorite
but
if
its
available
i
will
search
it
out
best
in
style
in
my
opinion
go
astros
i
had
this
about
a
week
ago
and
likely
wont
have
it
again
im
a
big
fan
of
other
victory
offerings
but
i
prefer
their
other
hoppier
styles
thats
not
surprising
since
i
dont
usually
favor
blonde
ales
overall
this
is
a
really
nice
summer
beer
light

refreshing
but
a

nicely
done
an
ok

nothing
special
o
this
is

beer
that
is

for

a

with

extremely

at

overall
nothing
to

about
i
found
this
to
be
quite
funky
with
the
hops
not
even
able
to
mask
it
i
typically
enjoy
everything
victory
does
but
this
is
an
exception
im
gonna
pretend
i
never
had
this
offering
ill
stick
to
blonde
women
instead
appearance
is
a
crystal
clear
golden
straw
color
with
a
thin
layer
of
head
that
dissipated
rapidly
the
nose
is
lightly
malty
and
the
maltiness
is
also
lightly
present
in
the
flavor
profile
this
offering
is
lightbodied
the
finish
has
a
semidry
bitterness
from
the
hops
which
appears
to
grow
more
hoppy
as
one
moves
down
the
glass
overall
drinkability
the
tart
crispness
with
the
very
german
style
finish
makes
me
think
of
a
beer
that
is
part
pilsner
part
us
citrusy
hops
the
overall
effect
is
something
that
is
very
refreshing
and
tasty
and
something
that
pairs
well
with
a
lot
of
different
flavors
went
very
well
with
a
burger
and
roasted
vegetables
beets
and
potatoes
ill
have
to
seek
this
one
out
again
very
drinkable
and
i
wouldnt
mind
having
a
larger
glass
of
it
overall
i
liked
the
composition
of
the
hop
ticket
session
ipa
better
than
summer
love
this
tastes
a
little
thin
to
me
the
grassy
and
slightly
floral
hops
are
more
forward
in
the
flavor
with
a
toasted
malt
character
right
off
the
bat
lingering
finish
the
taste
is
hoppier
than
i
expected
from
the
smell
the
nearly
untoasted
malt
does
provide
a
base
but
it
quickly
disappears
to
a
black
pepper
bitterness
full
bodied
for
the
style
but
also
with
an
elevated
level
of
carbonation
the
aftertaste
starts
off
balanced
but
devolves
to
simply
the
aforementioned
black
pepper
from
the
hop
ill
be
honest
im
not
a
natural
summerbeer
lover
i
prefer
the
deeper
more
complex
flavors
of
autumn
and
winter
brews
i
lean
toward
highergravity
beers
so
that
is
yet
another
turnoff
for
me
regarding
summery
types
that
said
this
beer
was
not
bad
for
a
5
2
summer
ale
it
doesnt
taste
quite
as
light
as
most
beers
of
this
season
there
is
a
distinctively
bitter
aftertaste
that
causes
me
to
be
of
the
opinion
that
this
beer
is
not
as
refreshing
as
a
commonplace
summer
brew
but
it
is
a
damn
good
beer
for
a
summerautumn
hybrid
flavor
of
the
season
indeed
this
american
blonde
ale
is
quite
refreshening
after
an
afternoon
of
grueling
lawn
mowing
its
golden
amber
color
signifies
the
refreshment
of
youth
like
that
of
a
childs
first
alcoholic
beverage
but
the
burliness
of
the
hops
reminds
you
that
this
beer
is
not
for
a
child
but
for
a
man
of
great
wisdom
with
a
minute
hint
of
citrus
heaping
amount
of
hops
and
arouma
that
is
suited
for
the
gods
one
would
be
a
fool
not
to
consume
o
really
great
beer
i
rate
to
style
on
balance
but
this
one
could
hold
its
own
against
most
of
them
a
twelve
pack
of
this
in
cans
would
beat
any
session
ipa
that
ive
had
as
far
as
summery
considerations
go
highly
recommended
if
you
can
find
it
summer
love
brewed
by
victory
brewing
company
with
an
abv
0f
5
2
this
brew
pours
out
a
cloudy
amber
color
with
a
small
white
head
this
is
an
an
filtered
brew
to
me
it
looks
like
an
wheat
brew
the
smell
is
sweet
and
crisp
im
picking
up
citrus
and
grains
this
brew
has
a
nice
smell
to
it
the
taste
is
bitter
there
is
a
lot
of
hops
to
this
brew
that
is
what
the
bitterness
is
coming
from
after
half
way
down
it
gets
better
the
taste
is
ok
and
im
leaving
it
at
that
mouthfeel
is
nice
and
clean
with
a
bitterness
of
hops
summer
love
does
have
some
smoothness
to
it
overall
im
giving
this
brew
a
3
25
out
of
5
not
the
best
ive
had
but
not
the
worst
ive
had
overall
this
is
a
great
summer
beer
for
me
i
am
a
big
fan
easy
to
drink
and
reminds
me
of
the
summer
i
will
definitely
have
it
again
a
3
5
overall
for
summer
love
this
will
be
a
staple
in
my
fridge
these
next
few
months
i
will
buy
this
brew
again
if
victory
was
to
make
a
lawnmower
beer
this
would
be
it
total
thirst
quencher
a
high
degree
of
drinkability
perfect
for
a
hot
mid
summer
cool
down
yes
its
an
ale
but
compared
to
victorys
other
offerings
thus
beer
is
muted
which
will
make
it
appealing
to
the
lager
crowds
and
dare
i
say
even
the
mainstream
budweiser
swilling
types
really
simple
i
like
this
beer
its
pour
its
smell
and
its
taste
it
is
to
me
what
a
american
summer
ale
should
taste
like
nice
job
victory
hard
to
find
here
in
northeast
ohio
so
i
bought
all
they
had
which
was
basically
a
case
ordering
me
some
more
though
have
others
to
try
though
but
will
gladly
nurse
these
overall
not
too
much
unlike
a
german
pilsener
but
has
qualities
of
an
ale
to
it
such
a
the
hops
on
the
back
end
of
the
taste
as
being
new
to
the
blond
ale
style
i
thought
this
was
refeshing
due
to
the
thinner
body
and
lemon
zest
it
has
to
it
i
thought
the
malt
up
front
was
a
bit
bland
however
though
that
does
not
detract
too
much
from
it
not
a
bad
offering
from
victory
a
truly
oddball
and
weird
one
now
this
was
picked
up
as
a
single
so
i
only
had
one
to
base
a
review
on
ill
try
to
pick
it
up
again
and
if
theres
anything
not
right
about
this
particular
bottle
ill
rereview
the
beer
but
it
doesnt
seem
like
theres
any
infection
or
reason
to
not
review
the
beer
the
store
that
sold
it
generally
takes
good
care
of
their
beer
so
for
the
moment
there
you
have
it
o
never
been
a
huge
blonde
fan
this
beer
has
high
drinkability
and
thats
its
selling
point
in
my
opinion
the
aroma
is
nice
and
it
presents
strongly
but
fails
to
fully
come
to
fruition
this
brew
is
ideal
for
whetting
the
whistle
and
fits
the
bill
for
summer
drinking
if
you
cross
paths
with
this
beer
plan
on
having
a
few
i
dont
believe
its
meant
for
sipping
had
this
in
what
seems
to
be
its
intended
setting
at
a
picnic
in
a
park
by
the
water
on
one
of
the
first
nice
days
of
summer
it
did
the
trick
but
wasnt
anything
particularly
special
it
has
the
same
strong
floral
hoppiness
going
on
as
many
other
summer
brews
though
there
isnt
quite
as
much
fruitiness
as
you
sometimes
get
from
blonde
ales
one
thing
ill
say
for
it
is
it
didnt
lose
flavor
as
i
drank
it
as
some
beers
do
on
hot
summer
days
o
i
feel
like
ive
had
this
beer
before
victory
tweaked
some
older
recipe
to
create
this
they
do
well
with
their
german
ingredients
adding
a
touch
of
this
us
hop
and
that
i
could
see
drinking
23
of
these
at
a
bbq
this
summer
a
little
grassy
a
little
pilsnery
a
little
bit
of
adjunct
but
a
decent
brew
and
easy
to
drink
almost
some
kind
of
vegetal
and
fruit
flavors
in
there
too
foamy
white
head
slightly
sticking
to
the
sides
do
you
ever
wonder
if
250
characters
might
be
too
many
for
some
brews
not
bad
at
all
but
i
find
the
bitterness
a
bit
strong
for
my
tastes
a
good
summer
beer
but
not
one
of
my
favorites
from
this
brewery
cheers
with
all
that
hoppy
goodness
victory
should
get
away
from
any
notion
of
this
being
a
blonde
ale
and
would
be
better
suited
to
advance
the
hop
structure
in
all
aroma
flavor
and
bitterness
and
lighten
the
body
to
make
summer
love
a
session
ipa
its

already

is

is
light
overall
a
hoppy
blonde
who
treats
you
right
more
bitter
than
i
prefer
but
more
complex
than
i
anticipated
very
refreshing
brew
medium

smoother
than

this
is
a
fantastic
beer
expertly
crafted
and
brewed
i
would
call
it
a
german
pils
with
the
added
pungency
of
simcoe
and
citra
totally
love
it
i
could
drink
a
6er
of
this
easy
during
a
day
at
the
beach
or
an
outdoor
barbecue
with
family
and
friends
highly
recommended
overall
for
a
blonde
this
is
a
tasty
beer
and
would
be
a
treat
on
a
hot
summer
day
overall
really
good
beer
surprised
with
this
one
i
think
this
is
my
first
blonde
my
favorite
summer
beer
and
one
of
my
favorite
beers
part
of
a
pick
your
own
sixer
from
the
market
it
is
still
summer
just
barely
so
lets
give
it
a
whirl
popping
the
top
i
get
a
very
earthy
dandelion
like
hoppiness
pouring
into
my
sapp
this
brew
is
a
bright
yellow
with
a
big
bubble
white
creamy
top
head
on
the
taste
the
hoppiness
prevails
up
front
not
bitter
but
very
bright
and
sharp
with
a
thin
maltiness
behind
it
that
doesnt
diminish
the
sharpness
of
the
hops
a
different
hop
belt
very
yerba
like
and
sweet
yet
strong
not
really
my
kind
of
flavor
overall
definitely
a
decent
brew
refreshing
and
well
balanced
but
theres
not
really
a
whole
lot
going
on
its
worth
a
try
though
i
wouldnt
go
to
any
lengths
to
seek
it
out
overall
i
could
see
myself
lining
up
to
buy
these
at
a
ball
game
that
is
for
sure
not
too
complex
but
tasty
overall
victory
summer
love
may
approach
the
platonic
ideal
of
a
summer
beer
pours
a
very
deceptively
straw
yellow
big
foamy
head
smells
very
much
like
a
pilsner
with
big
german
aromatics
first
sip
is
slightlly
astringent
bitter
hops
maybe
saaz
or
centennial
but
mostly
for
flavor
makes
way
to
a
sweet
but
still
light
malt
body
best
parts
about
this
beer
is
1
it
is
consistent
2
it
doesnt
taste
like
a
blonde
ale
its
more
like
a
light
hoppy
pilsner
with
and
american
twist
for
a
summer
seasonal
there
sure
are
worse
beers
mouthfeel
this
is
light
bodied
beer
that
when
served
the
proper
temp
can
make
for
a
nice
tasty
pint
while
relaxing
on
your
porch
after
mowing
your
lawn
on
a
hot
ohio
day
pours
clear
yellow
color
not
quite
finger
width
head
mainly
bubbly
very
little
lacing
on
side
has
more
of
an
stale
apple
aroma
with
hints
of
citrus
malty
lemon
flavor
up
front
with
moderate
hoppy
character
on
the
end
hoppiness
is
more
grassy
soapy
aftertaste
on
the
back
end
more
than
i
expect
from
a
blonde
ale
i
am
usually
not
a
fan
of
the
style
but
the
hoppy
character
is
a
plus
for
me
soapy
taste
on
the
end
is
a
little
odd
for
me
while
im
enjoying
it
on
my
couch
i
can
imagine
itd
be
best
enjoyed
out
in
the
sun
i
loved
the
taste
but
i
wasnt
as
keen
on
the
way
it
felt
in
my
mouth
a
little
dryer
than
i
like
i
loved
the
sweet
and
airy
flavor
and
it
has
a
fun
bottle
definitely
something
id
drink
again
o
this
is
a
little
darling
of
a
beer
it
strikes
the
perfect
balance
between
flavor
and
simple
drinkability
its
just
a
fun
and
easy
beer
to
drink
and
thats
exactly
what
you
want
in
a
summer
seasonal
one
of
the
better
blondes
ive
had
in
a
while
overall
really
good
and
very
refreshing
reminds
me
a
bit
of
sierra
nevadas
pale
ale
id
drink
it
again
anytime
a
great
session
beer
this
pours
a
nice
golden
hue
theres
a
slight
crisp
lemony
aroma
to
this
with
a
similar
characteristic
on
the
palate
finishes
with
just
a
touch
of
biscuit
and
a
pleasing
crispness
along
with
a
graceful
tartness
that
i
found
to
be
refreshing
and
enjoyable
this
might
be
a
new
contender
for
summer
beers
clean
crisp
and
so
much
better
than
the
sort
of
stuff
that
passes
for
a
summer
beer
these
days
cant
believe
this
is
a
blonde
aleit
gives
me
hope
for
the
style
seriously
this
puts
the
majority
of
blonde
ales
ive
had
to
shame
its
very
good
just
delicious
light
bodied
but
quite
hoppy
brew
love
the
hops
in
this
very
bright
and
clean
perfect
for
the
summer
the
taste
was
light
yet
full
of
malty
goodness
and
just
the
right
hoppyness
a
perfect
balance
in
my
opinion
very
drinkable
for
both
a
light
beer
drinker
and
for
those
wanting
something
more
this
is
a
beer
that
could
convert
your
miller
and
bud
friends
into
a
craft
drinker
3
75
d
supremely
drinkable
perfect
lawnmower
beer
or
anytime
beer
o
very
drinkable
session
beer
its
not
meant
to
overwhelm
the
senses
and
isnt
for
sitting
down
and
sipping
this
beer
is
meant
for
drinking
quickly
and
often
i
can
feel
the
summer
love
prost
just
enough
flavor
to
keep
it
interesting
friartuck
o
a
good
summer
beer
if
i
come
across
one
at
a
ball
game
i
would
order
one
one
of
the
better
summer
seasonals
i
have
tasted
as
i
find
most
of
them
to
be
very
bland
this
one
is
almost
like
an
ipa
with
a
somewhat
lower
alcohol
and
less
malt
to
make
it
into
a
more
refreshing
thirstquenching
beer
i
prefer
it
to
the
many
bland
american
wheat
ales
coming
out
in
summer
it
has
great
bitterness
for
a
blond
ale
tasty
not
a
bad
beer
at
all
wouldnt
go
out
of
my
way
to
get
it
again
wouldnt
think
less
of
someone
if
they
brought
it
to
a
bbq
wouldnt
bring
it
to
a
bbq
love
this
stuff
the
aroma
of
flowery
hops
just
the
right
bite
light
carbonation
lovely
beer
tast
im
hooked
i
could
drink
this
till
the
cows
come
home
a
quality
session
beer
that
will
not
bankrupt
you
you
will
not
tire
of
the
taste
of
this
lovely
brew
try
it
youll
like
it
hey
its
from
victory
great
stuff
this
beer
had
the
best
nose
but
in
the
drink
it
felt
somewhat
bland
and
muddled
it
was
very
mild
simple
and
not
in
a
bad
way
light
and
drinkable
clear
and
straw
in
color
this
beer
is
light
in
complexion
moderately
carbonated
and
is
topped
with
a
nice
white
head
the
aroma
is
clean
grass
and
grain
not
much
fruit
but
a
moderate
hop
scent
peppery
but
quiet
crisp
and
a
tad
bitter
not
really
sweet
but
there
is
a
flavor
of
malt
medium
in
body
mor
substantial
than
expected
nicely
drinkable
o
nicely
done
and
look
forward
to
the
yearly
release
o
i
like
this
beer
and
wil
enjoy
drinking
it
in
the
summer
hence
the
love
i
didnt
go
crazy
for
it
but
its
quite
a
delicious
and
flavorful
summer
beer
recommended
this
one
is
exactly
what
the
doctor
ordered
for
summertime
quaffing
light
piney
and
easy
to
enjoy
o
not
a
beer
i
would
order
all
that
often
but
at
the
right
price
point
i
could
see
picking
this
up
occasionally
i
could
see
myself
brewing
a
slightly
hoppier
version
myself
for
sure
but
there
is
no
big
flaw
in
this
beer
solid
and
enjoyable
overall
this
is
an
ok
beer
but
a
good
poolside
offering
i
would
have
this
again
at
a
bbq
on
a
hot
day
but
otherwise
it
doesnt
have
the
best
blend
of
flavors
for
my
taste
still
its
above
an
average
beer
by
far
o
eh
could
do
without
but
its
not
awful
you
really
never
find
this
much
flavor
in
a
blonde
too
often
high
c
o
a
solid
choice
for
an
outside
pleasant
weather
beer
a
pretty
good
summer
beer
overall
which
is
saying
something
because
most
taste
the
same
id
have
it
again
o
i
had
this
on
draft
over
the
summer
with
some
oysters
and
was
surprised
by
how
much
i
liked
it
ill
be
picking
this
up
again
when
the
warm
weather
returns
overall
this
beer
was
way
too
bitter
for
me
overall
pretty
good
i
was
not
expecting
that
hop
kick
but
its
a
nice
addition
as
much
as
i
like
the
hops
i
personally
would
have
liked
a
bit
less
hop
in
this
and
more
malt
forward
or
at
least
more
late
addition
hops
and
less
bitterness
otherwise
a
nice
tasty
beer
overall
this
is
a
decent
example
of
the
style
and
one
that
is
fine
to
consume
on
a
warm
summer
afternoon
the
flavor
profile
is
not
too
outstanding
and
leaves
me
wanting
a
little
more
there
are
much
better
sessionable
ales
out
there
that
this
one
does
not
need
to
be
in
anyones
regular
rotation
o
overall
a
pretty
nice
blonde
ale
that
is
smooth
and
easy
to
drink
lots
of
citrus
to
it
especially
in
the
taste
would
definitely
have
it
again
sometime
a
good
summer
beer
o
overall
a
great
beer
and
like
it
a
lot
will
enjoy
this
sixer
and
perhaps
more
before
summer
is
over
pours
clear
golden
with
lots
of
carbonation
and
a
fluffy
white
head
smells
fruity
with
pears
and
green
apple
a
bit
of
sweetness
taste
follows
suit
with
a
refreshing
lemon
peel
twist
a
great
summer
ale
with
no
skunky
lingering
aftertaste
which
is
usually
my
complaint
with
similar
brews
like
sam
adams
top
tier
for
the
style
id
sip
this
all
summer
long
so
drinkable
and
just
incredible
pleasant
o
i
am
not
a
fan
of
victory
but
this
is
one
of
the
better
beers
that
i
have
had
from
them
had
a
chance
to
enjoy
a
few
of
these
beers
while
on
the
beach
in
the
outer
banks
surprised
to
see
it
as
a
blonde
ale
tasted
pretty
hoppy
and
struck
me
as
a
pale
ale
regardless
its
a
delicious
refreshing
beer
thats
well
balanced
and
crisp
with
a
great
finish
would
definitely
recommend
and
makes
for
a
nice
light
summer
beer
overall
this
is
a
wonderful
beer
for
hot
weather
providing
refreshment
and
flavor
at
the
same
time
sign
me
up
for
a
sixer
this
beer
looks
very
nice
on
the
pour
and
the
nose
is
outstanding
the
flavor
hit
me
kind
of
sideways
as
i
didnt
expect
it
but
as
time
went
on
it
either
mellowed
out
or
i
got
used
to
it
and
appreciated
it
more
real
nice
floral
hoppy
character
consistent
smooth
fresh
a
very
nice
beer
im
feeling
the
summer
love
on
this
one
o
very
enjoyable
summer
beer
i
havent
had
a
lot
of
victory
beers
but
each
one
had
impressed
me
this
one
is
no
different
and
is
a
gotta
have
one
gotta
have
six
beer
not
a
review
as
much
as
a
comment
this
was
my
goto
beer
last
summer
but
have
been
unable
to
find
it
in
2012
it
is
what
a
summer
ale
shopuld
be
light
but
hoppy
refreshing
but
not
too
filling
i
miss
it
in
the
meantime
i
will
be
cooling
down
with
new
holland
white
hatter
although
completly
different
styles
they
are
very
similar
o
if
you
ever
wanted
a
beer
that
is
simply
straight
nofrills
germanstyle
drinkability
this
ones
for
you
its
not
going
to
win
any
medals
or
satisfy
a
palate
thats
looking
for
complexity
but
it
does
do
exactly
what
it
advertises
drink
smooth
and
tasty
on
a
hot
summer
day
o
just
not
my
glass
of
beer
it
seems
to
have
a
great
cult
following
so
if
youre
in
to
these
types
of
beers
you
may
like
it
unfortunately
i
did
not
taste
is
full
enough
and
slightly
grainy
touch
of
spritz
and
grain
on
the
finish
full
and
spicy
body
and
feel
very
neutral
as
for
yeast
influence
but
clever
spicinghop
influence
warming
yields
more
lemon
and
pepper
upon
a
nice
pils
base
quite
drinkable
and
not
overdone
with
a
clean
finish
o
love
the
hopcentricity
of
this
summer
creation
the
lingering
bitterness
makes
it
a
quaffable
sipper
while
the
body
makes
it
possible
to
take
a
few
down
it
might
be
a
better
fit
as
a
summer
pale
ale
but
again
expect
no
less
from
victory
4
poured
from
a
bottle
into
a
tumbler
pint
the
beer
is
a
pale
slightly
hazed
goldenrod
coloring
with
a
slow
flow
of
small
carbonation
bubbles
present
throughout
and
a
thin
ring
of
film
around
the
surface
aromas
of
toasted
grains
slight
buttery
sweetness
and
a
light
hopping
flavors
are
a
bit
more
hopped
with
a
slightly
bitter
forward
flavor
followed
by
a
solid
smooth
toasted
grain
backbone
the
buttery
notes
catch
the
tail
end
leading
into
the
bitter
and
spiced
hoppy
aftertaste
the
finish
is
crisp
clean
and
slightly
dry
very
easy
to
drink
very
refreshing
and
slightly
hoppier
than
most
brews
in
this
style
tasty
beer
o
a
really
nice
summer
beer
and
one
that
id
seek
out
again
o
pretty
damn
good
this
is
the
kind
of
beer
that
knows
what
it
is
and
knows
what
it
isnt
drink
it
on
a
hot
summer
day
cough
without
a
care
in
the
world
and
itll
treat
you
like
a
champ
a
real
nice
summer
treat
this
was
perfect
to
throw
back
and
enjoy
very
above
average
taste
and
while
not
the
most
complex
of
beers
it
is
a
standout
as
far
as
summer
beers
forget
the
style
think
beer
to
drink
all
day
and
night
at
a
party
which
has
much
better
flavor
than
a
macro
brew
ill
definitely
seek
this
out
in
the
summer
again
d
love
this
brew
bought
a
sixer
and
would
buy
another
its
rare
that
i
buy
a
6
pack
of
anything
these
days
i
prefer
mix
a
sixes
i
did
so
with
this
and
dont
regret
it
however
one
thing
i
need
to
say
if
you
are
looking
for
a
traditional
summer
ale
light
easy
drinking
look
elsewhere
this
one
is
highly
bitter
and
doesnt
really
fit
into
the
summer
ale
spectrum
overall
i
think
american
blondes
are
one
of
the
more
subjective
styles
of
beer
and
this
one
is
not
only
very
good
but
also
fairly
different
from
others
i
have
had
that
being
said
it
isnt
the
best
summer
beer
out
there
fr
refreshing
character
but
it
definitely
has
the
flavor
many
summer
brews
lack
today
was
victory
day
trying
a
number
of
victorys
that
i
had
not
previously
recorded
on
ba
and
the
three
i
had
all
were
better
than
expected
well
done
o
a
solid
summer
beer
with
good
flavor
and
easy
drinkability

nicely

excellent
summer
brew
i
could
not
think
of
a
better
ale
to
have
on
a
warm
summer
evening
while
the
ale
is
not
complex
it
has
a
solid
flavor
profile
and
remains
thirst
quenching
from
start
to
finish
o
a
good
smooth
beer
that
id
recommend
tasty
but
isnt
overwhelming
at
all
definitely
fitting
for
the
summer
even
with
a
relatively
gentle
pour
i
still
wound
up
with
twoplus

an

nose
had
a

hoppiness
and
my
mouth
began
to
water
mouthfeel
was
medium
and
the
hops
were
quite
evident
on
the
tongue
in
fact
perhaps
more
than
i
would
have
preferred
if
it
is
to
be
a
summer
blonde
i
prefer
a
little
more
subtlety
and
yet
recently
i
have
been
feeling
more
and
more
like
victorys
beers
are
over
the
top
especially
regarding
their
use
of
hops
and
that
from
a
hophead
i
do
not
know
whether
it
is
on
their
end
or
mine
but
as
a
consumer
i
am
not
as
pleased
as
in
the
past
the
finish
was
quite
dry
and
somewhat
refreshing
but
i
just
felt
like
it
needed
to
be
better
offset
with
the
malts
that
they
mentioned
that
or
tone
down
the
hops
wait
did
i
really
just

is

definitely
more

expected
in
a
odd

plenty
of

not

easy

drinking
this
is
unique
and
strangely
good
this
is
light

crisp
and
refreshing
this
might
not
be
a
great
blonde
ale
but
i
like
it
its
got
a
nice
refreshing
hop
flavor
that
is
a
nice
addition
to
a
light
summer
ale
overall
a
good
session
brew
that
is
easy
to
drink
while
hanging
out
and
sitting
around
with
friends
or
just
watching
the
game
on

enjoyable

wet

refreshing
across
the

with
a
medium

well

moderate

imparts
the
correct
feel
to
the

certainly
one
of
the
best

ales
ive
had
this
is
a
decent
beer
for
a
summer
offering
it
has
a
solid

character
and
great
drinkinability
ill
definitely
try
this
out
again
o
very
easy
to
drink
very
enjoyable
and
very
sessionable
nice
and
light
and
very
enjoyable
goes
down
easy
on
a
summer
day
or
evening
o
it
could
be
a
good
summer
beer
i
would
rather
have
a
nice
ipa
with
more
malt
flavors
in
it
however
its
light
and
has
a
decent
noble
hop
presence
kick
but
just
not
much
in
the
body
or
complexity
side
the
body
was
light
and
good
carbonation
helped
carry
the
flavors
across
the
beer
was
slightly
sticky
at
the
end
however
drinkability
was
very
good
this
could
slip
down
your
throat
effortlessly
all
day
long
overall
a
very
good
brew
i
think
the
brewers
hit
their
target
for
this
beer
deadon
worth
trying
overall
quaffable
refreshing
stuff
best
nofrills
summer
beer
ive
had
in
a
while
o
ugh
started
out
well
but
barely
drinkable
by
the
end
maybe
im
super
sensitive
to
a
hop
variety
they
used
in
this
or
just
cat
piss
in
general
because
im
surprised
not
many
other
reviewers
have
picked
it
out
very
light
up
front
its
super
light
base
malt
with
a
sharp
herbal
medicinal
hop
just
a
bit
of
lemon
and
lemon
peel
just
enough
very
balanced
and
light
feeling
with
the
medicinal
hop
going
through
the
finish
doesnt
finish
as
clean
as
i
expected
which
is
the
only
problem
i
find
with
the
beer
color
is
a
golden
straw
with
an
average
sized
head
that
fades
quickly
the
smell
wonderfully
balanced
reminding
me
of
a
fruit
cocktail
of
pears
apples
and
peaches
the
taste
leans
toward
citrus
and
floral
hops
with
a
malty
sweetness
in
the
background
mouthfeel
is
on
the
thin
side
but
this
is
to
be
expected
from
a
lightbodied
summer
ale
makes
a
great
summertime
beer
pairs
great
with
a
baseball
game
o
a
good
crisp
summer
beer
that
certainly
drinks
like
a
blonde
but
has
plenty
of
flavor
solid
brew
o
this
seems
like
an
ale
version
of
samuel
adams
noble
pils
its
pretty
one
dimensional
on
the
noble
hop
flavors
but
those
are
good
flavors
a
decent
to
good
summer
seasonal
this
is
a
terrific
summer
beer
that
i
will
surely
be
drinking
all
summer
long
i
really
liked
this
one
and
thankfully
its
all
over
the
shelves
right
now
a
lot
of
flavor
and
character
in
a
lighter
bodied
beer
fine
summer
drinking
snappy
grassy
light
bodied
but
full
flavored
grainy
malts
up
the
middle
mild
crisp
bitterness
keeps
me
sipping
reminds
me
of
a
lighter
version
of
the
hop
profile
they
used
for
prima
pils
effervescent
perfect
but
dangerous
summer
beer

doesnt
seem
like
much
but
on
a
hot
summer
day
a
cookout
i
could
drink
these
as
if
they
were
a
4ish
session
beer
alll
day
and
end
up
feeling
very
poorly
at
the
end
of
the
day
might
be
my
new
favorite
summer
beer
o
nice
summer
beer
but
lacks
a
lot
of
meat
on
the
bones
much
like
many
beers
in
this
style
refreshing
o
a
light
crisp
beer
just
a
little
too
bitter
to
be
truly
refreshing
lingering
alcohol
heat
and
pine
in
the
aftertaste
cut
down
on
drinkability
definitely
a
good
choice
with
a
few
different
beers
but
wouldnt
be
a
good
session
beer
overall
a
good
beer
pours
a
light
golden
color
in
a
glass
with
good
visible
carbonation
a
good
head
although
it
disappears
in
a
matter
of
minutes
a
bitter
taste
at
first
but
finishes
with
a
good
balance
of
malt
hops
and
a
hint
of
wheat
and
lemon
rinds
not
the
best
out
of
victory
brews
but
definitely
one
of
my
favorite
summer
ales
great
for
its
class
given
that
i
prefer
beers
with
a
strong
hop
presence
i
give
it
a
910
a
good
almost
toned
down
version
of
their
prima
pils
a
good
solid
session
beer
that
would
please
any
beer
drinker
this
isnt
a
style
i
would
pick
up
and
session
all
the
time
at
least
at
this
time
in
my
life
but
is
a
good
solid
drinker
good
summer
love
is
a
great
summer
offering
from
victory
the
taste
is
good
and
well
balanced
the
beer
is
smooth
but
not
thin
and
can
serve
as
a
refresher
or
a
session
beer
if
you
come
across
this
brew
in
any
form
during
its
short
summer
vacation
and
they
get
in
the
way
of
everything
else
the
extrabitter
aftertaste
is
also
strange

wow
a
pretty
decent
and
enjoyable
brew
one
of
those
beers
that
works
well
with
the
warm
weather
as
its
got
some
bright
flavors
to
it
what
an
excellent
beer
the
aroma
is
just
out
of
this
world
my
one
complaint
would
be
the
bitterness
feels
a
little
too
much
for
the
style
but
it
is
a
mild
complaint
unfortunately
i
cant
buy
this
in
my
area
but
i
am
definitely
stocking
up
on
my
next

are
starting
to
make
presence
in
the

which
i
welcome
far
too
little
attention
has
been
given
to
this
style
this
is
totally
one
that
id
drink
of
this
style
on
the
regular
enjoyed
my
first
pint
on
draught
in
pa
tonight
and
will
seek
out
again
whenever
possible
pours
a
medium
yellow
with
a
nice
tall
head
that
sticks
around
and
leaves
lacing
the
smell
is
hoppy
upfront
but
only
some
aspects
of
the
hops
like
pine
the
weird
thing
is
you
dont
get
much
of
that
in
the
flavor
the
pine
is
there
but
not
as
much
as
the
smell
would
suggest
the
flavor
starts
with
the
small
pine
then
moves
to
a
slight
yeastmalt
combo
and
finishes
with
a
slight
pine
but
very
refreshing
taste
the
mouthfeel
is
great
smooth
and
refreshing
great
amount
of
flavor
but
not
overpowering
overall
a
great
beer
nice
for
a
hot
summer
night
definitely
worth
checking
out
this
is
a
nice
example
of
the
style
with
just
enough
character
to
keep
it
in
the
style
but
not
at
all
lacking
oa
one
of
the
better
summer
style
ales
ive
had
in
a
while
its
a
good
brew
and
i
am
sure
it
will
find
its
place
in
my
cooler
again
d
easy
drinker
with
low
abv
i
like
it
drinkability
and
overall
impression
i
initially
wasnt
expecting
much
from
this
beer
but
was
quite
pleased
at
how
much
i
enjoyed
it
it
was
both
something
nice
to
drink
on
its
own
and
ill
be
happy
to
do
so
again
and
it
was
a
pleasure
to
pair
with
food
my
overall
impression
is
that
this
is
a
winner
while
it
may
not
be
world
class
it
is
quite
good
quite
enjoyable
and
ill
be
having
it
again
definitely
a
beer
for
a
summer
party
and
to
enjoy
with
a
light
meal
the
cpj
i
think
this
is
a
pretty
damn
good
summer
seasonalit
reminds
me
a
little
bit
of
victorys
prima
pils
with
some
american
hops
tossed
in
yummy
thirst
quenching
and
easy
drinking
ill
definitely
be
drinking
this
one
again
light
bodied
with
a
uppity
carbonation
that
settles
out
over
time
though
thats
not
much
of
an
issue
as
its
hard
to
do
anything
other
than
pound
these
back
call
it
a
lawnmower
beer
and
id
cut
the
grass
more
often
its
supremely
refreshing
this

me

that
sticks
around
as
a

some

in
the
nose
a
touch

lemony

some

while
neither

one
area
it
is
a

beer
for
the
summer
if
more
widely
available
a
case
of
this
would
be
my
regular
tailgatebbq
beer
victory
brewing
seems
to
be
heading
in
an
interesting
direction
releasing
beers
such
as
summer
love
and
headwaters
pale
ale
rather
than
going
more
extreme
they
seem
to
be
going
for
more
mass
market
appeal
with
smaller
simpler
more
drinkable
beers
im
good
with
that
summer
love
is
good
beer
as
is
headwaters
summer
love
really
is
a
nice
drinkable
beer
to
kick
back
with
this
time
of
year
im
enjoying
it
easy
recommendation
musically
id
pair
this
beer
with
second
chance
by
peter
bjorn
and
john
this
is
a
very
good
blonde
ale
some
bonus
points
for
being
in
a
category
that
is
filled
with
many
subpar
beers
hops
may
not
quite
be
to
style
but
they
certainly
add
a
great
element
to
this
beer
would
get
again
o
a
very
drinkable
beer
i
could
definitely
have
a
few
of
these
at
the
ballpark
and
enjoy
life
this
is
one
i
feel
comfortable
drinking
more
quickly
and
something
to
be
enjoyed
for
beers
sake
very
drinkable
to
say
the
least
really
pushes
the
american
blonde
ale
category
and
bridges
on
the
gap
of
apa
in
general
it
is
quite
easy
to
put
back
a
few
of
these
summer
love
indeed
medium
bodied
with
a
good
balance
of
floral
bitter
hops
pale
malt
spice
and
fruit
notes
crisp
hop
bite
up
front
that
provides
some
dry
bitterness
and
compliments
the
earthy
grass
and
straw
notes
this
is
countered
by
the
sweet
malt
and
hints
of
apple
pear
and
lemon
well
balanced
and
easy
to
drink
especially
during
the
warmer
months
i
was
a
little
nervous
by
the
initial
appearance
but
this
beer
is
pretty
complex
and
flavorful
pretty
nice
for
this
time
of
year
on
tap
at
the
mellow
in
greensboro
poured
into
a

this
is
a
great
clean
and
fresh
summer
beer
not
heavy
on
the
palate
which
is
to
say
too
pale
for
a
pale
ale
the
smell
is
dominated
mostly
by
grassy
hops
with
a
little
tinge
of
lemonthere
is
a
bit
of
sulfur
in
the
aroma
as
the
beer
warms
and
a
bit
of

veggie
the
taste
was
very
nice
and
clean
with
light
malt
flavors
overall
a
tasty
brew
with
a
great
level
of
flavor
and
an
easy
drinking
feel

characteristics

hops
kick

plane
drying
it
out
at
the
finish
very
crisp
and
clean
beer
but
not
as
smooth
and
velvety
as
some
of
the
british
or
belgian
varieties
a
little
hoppy
for
my
taste
but
good
for
a
summer
afternoon
ive
not
much
experience
with
golden
ales
i
guess
but
i
was
expecting
something
a
little
more
drinkable
it
has
a
citrusy
finish
similar
to
a
pale
ale
i
give
it
points
for
being
organic
and
it
seems
relatively
complex
for
a
lighter
beer
i
chose
this
beer
cause
i
really
like
pike
ipa
and
wanted
give
one
of
there
other
brews
a
taste
this
is
is
a
great
break
away
from
hoppy
brews
and
i
really
appreciate
the
obvious
craft
of
creating
another
fine
brew
i
will
still
enjoy
my
ipas
but
this
one
is
on
the
list
for
another
way
to
enjoy
fine
beer
i
think
all
my
texas
friends
who
are
not
craft
beer
drinkers
would
enjoy
it
as
well
conclusion
this
beer
is
a
good
session
beer
for
experienced
craft
beer
drinkers
for
noobs
there
may
be
to
much
flavor
probably
just
fine
on
a
hot
day
not
terribly
interesting
to
me
overall
its
enjoyable
perhaps
not
my
personal
favorite
from
pike
but
still
tasty
had
this
at
uncle
ulis
in
leavenworth
crystal
clear
straw
color
with
a
nice
white
head
floral
and
sweet
notes
in
the
aroma
very
smooth
and
malty
flavor
very
drinkable
light
malty
sweetness
with
mild
bitterness
and
a
dry
finish
im
not
a
huge
blonde
ale
fan
but
i
think
this
one
represents
this
style
well
and
is
another
good
beer
from
this
brewery
o
very
much
a
classic
pilsner
flavour
and
feel
close
enough
to
a
blonde
ale
and
worth
a
purchase
either
way
o
most
american
blondes
really
dont
do
much
for
me
and
this
one
was
no
different
again
nothing
really
wrong
with
it
average
httpwww
facebook
comkajiisbeerreviews
overall
a
decent
pale
ale
aside
from
that
vaguely
musty
quality
on
the
palate
thats
enough
reason
not
to
have
this
again
though
given
the
crowded
field
of
better
pale
ales
out
there
pretty
dull
beer
not
particularly
impressed
overall
light
refreshing
soft
feel
and
good
flavor
for
a
blonde
ale
pretty
good
for
a
3
bomber
a
nice
summer
drinker
ill
probably
get
it
again
at
some
point
o
overall
i
should
have
tried
this
sooner
its

with

balancing
it
very

perfect
beer
for
this
nice
spring
afternoon

a
very
well
balanced

that
doesnt
assault

with
tons
of

finish
nice
tasty
brew
it
took
some
time
but
pike
brewing
has
arrived
in
orange
county
to
all
the
hop
bombs
i
can
easily
grab
from
the
shelf
this
is
a
fair
alternative
for
those
who
arent
looking
to
get
their
palate
thrashed
in
a
pinch
its
more
like
an
english
pale
ale
than
american
pale
ale
its
pretty
good
beer
a
superb
enjoyment
o
a
pretty
good
beer
but
very
easy
to
forget
opinion
this
is
a
pretty
good
pale
ale
overall
it
is
drinkable
and
has
a
nice
balance
the
grassy
note
is
a
bit
out
of
balance
but
overall
that
is
a
pretty
nitpicky
thing
this
is
one
of
the
better
examples
of
this
style
i
have
had
and
i
would
definitely
recommend
giving
it
a
shot
d
a
tasty
offering
reminiscent
of
a
hopped
up
pilsener
worth
a
try
but
dont
expect
anything
spectacular
d
sure
its
fairly
light
and
drinkable
its
an
average
offering
overall
a
decent
enough
pale
ale
restrained
in
the
bitterness
but
still
exhibiting
a
full
flavour

good

final

a
delicious

session
beer
ideal
for
when
you
want
a
beer
with
flavor
but
thats
easy
on
the
palate
and
you
can
have
a
few
in
a
single
setting
would
make
an
excellent
party
or
afteryardwork
beer
d
average
drinkability
even
its
unusual
low
abv
hardly
makes
this
a
contender
for
more
just
a
boring
example
flat
and
lazy
drink
that
is
mediocre
at
best
average
excitement
not
particularly
sharp
and
defined
and
rather
lifeless
and
mundane
pours
a
rather
typical
clear
yellow
with
a
foamy
white
head
aroma
is
not
strong
but
is
crisp
and
malty
if
not
inspiring
flavor
fortunately
is
better
malty
and
a
little
fruity
with
a
faint
and
not
too
unpleasant
tinny
undertone
texture
is
smooth
and
just
a
little
fizzy
overall
fair
to
middlin
and
leaning
towards
middlin
i
think
im
pretty
jaded
at
this
point
nellie
doesnt
look
all
that
naughty
to
me
the
brew
pours
a
mostly
clear
orange
juice
topped
by
a
finger
of
white
foam
the
nose
comprises
wheat
corn
floral
hops
coriander
cardamom
and
a
tiny
touch
of
coffeelaced
toffee
the
taste
comprises
the
toffee
corn
wheat
florals
and
a
touch
of
newcoming
orangepeel
the
body
is
pretty
light
with
a
light
carbonation
and
a
nearly
crisp
finish
overall
a
very
ordinary
brew
nothing
much
going
on
but
very
drinkable
nonetheless
not
bad
if
youre
looking
for
a
session
brew
the
low
abv
does
show
through
on
the
mouthfeel
though
with
a
slight
slick
and
watery
feel
but
even
so
this
is
a
marvellous
hot

beer
average
but
drinkable

a

to
their
other

compared

this
one
is
made
for
the

i
take
it
it
isnt

its
just
a

i
dunno
maybe
they
still

minimal

drinkability
would
have
loved
to
have
more
abv
present
but
it
was
made
well
for
style
drinkability
a
light
though
pleasant
very
easily
drinkable
beer
that
was
the
one
singular
shining
grace
in
a
night
of
being
forced
to
sit
through
twilight
in
its
entirety
however
id
consider
it
more
in
line
with
a
blonde
ale
as
opposed
to
a
pale
ale
but
what
do
i
know
it
has
a
thick
body
with
a
big
malt
backbone
it
has
a
nice
bitter
finish
to
it
that
is
pretty
dry
the
taste
overall
to
me
is
pretty
bland
but
it
is
a
nice
golden
ale
it
is
very
approachable
bright
citrus
hops

a
soft

mild
with

this
is

is

can
be

very

this
would
make
a
stellar
session
beer
not
a
pike
favorite
for
me
but
also
not
something
id
normally
drink
in
any
event
since
i
almost
always
drink
a
higher
alcohol
brew
not
bad
just
not
my
thing
the
body
was
medium
full
not
as
full
as
others
of
the
style
without
being
the
least
bit
heavy
this
is
a
very
drinkable
beer
crisp
light
refreshing
and
easy
to
enjoy

may
be
the

thin

this
beer
is
the
middle
management
human
resources
job
of
american
pale
ales
just
there
for
the
paycheck
like
this
review
the
beer
started
out
with
high
hopes
then
the
wheels
come
off
this
one
had
nice
flavors
added
to
good
drinkability
sessionable
for
sure
nothing
exceptional
but
an
acceptable
standby
if
nobody
else
is
home
naughty
nellies
lacks
the
hoppy
bitterness
to
be
considered
a
pale
ale
in
the
sense
that
we
all
know
it
by
it
is
mild
in
character
throughout
cloudy
pale
and
yellow
in
the
color
fruity
in
the
nose
and
the
mouth
with
no
big
malt
or
hop
characteristics
jumping
out
at
you
fine
mouthfeel
and
good
drinkability
it
tastes
fine
and
has
a
good
abv
that
you
drink
for
a
while
all
in
all
i
was
pleasantly
surprised
by
this
one
at
times
it
felt
a
bit
mundane
and
usual
but
at
the
same
time
its
unbelievably
drinkable
and
smooth
great
with
food
decent
on
its
own
and
all
in
all
delicious
this
one
would
also
make
a
solid
entry
into
craft
brew
for
those
unfamiliar
nothing
too
offensive
or
powerful
sample
at
the
brewpub
this
brew
pours
a
clear
golden
color
with
a
thin
and
foamy
offwhite
head
that
diminishes
steadily
sticky
patches
of
lacing
on
the
glass
mild
hops
and
grass
in
the
nose
lightbodied
with
a
light
hoppy
character
with
notes
of
malt
and
hay
the
finish
is
floral
hops
with
a
lightly
bitter
aftertaste
average
overall
we
bought
this
because
my
wifes
name
is
nellie
not
because
we
wanted
the
beer
it
surprised
me
and
im
glad
i
had
it
i
would
recommend
this
to
anyone
who
prefers
a
less
hoppy
pilsnerpale
ale
style
that
leans
towards
the
sweet
side
poured
a
light

color

some

nice
balance
medium
bodied
full
flavor
mouthfeel
is
full
and
round
finish
is
crisp
and
clean
aftertaste
is
hoppy
and
bitter
overall
the
mouth
feel
is
astringent
and
powdery
dry
the
finish
is
bitter
the
beer
comes
off
as
flat
and
light
struck
there
is
a
slight
sulfur
taste
mingling
in
the
beer
the
head
is
not
persistent
the
beer
is
uninteresting
and
boring
i
didnt
think
that
beer
can
live
up
to
its
name
on
the
label
the
hops
are
dull
in
the
beer
and
adds
no
character
the
malt
comes
off
shallow
which
leads
to
a
bland
personality
fairly
average
would
not
seek
out
again
not
an
exciting
ale
but
a
decent
introductory
standby
thats
very
companionable
with
a
burger
very
enjoyable
actually
d
pretty
good
coffee
was
unexpected
but
welcomed
addition
purchased
liquid
solutions
drinks
alright
just
not
enough
going
flavorwise
to
hold
my
interest
past
one
or
two
the
taste
brings
a
white
wine
sweetness
that
is
balanced
promptly
by
citrus
hops
and
a
hint
of
pine
perhaps
this
is
an
american
pale
ale
after
all
either
way
this
beer
tastes
good
id
even
like
the
hoppiness
if
it
were
a
golden
ale
so
no
marks
against
it
the
mouthfeel
is
juicy
and
clean
with
a
crisp
bubbly
finish
that
picks
up
a
touch
of
bitterness
from
the
hops
i
can
get
down
with
this
brew
although
the
style
isnt
my
favorite
you
can
taste
the
craftsmanship
behind
the
beer
as
with
most
of
pike
brewing
cos
creations
taste
is
somewhat
watery
and
light
hops
some
wheat
grainy
some
citrus
and
just
a
touch
of
bitterness
thanks
to
my
son
for
muleing
this
one
back
from
seattle
and
for
the
warning
that
its
not
much
of
a
drinker
if
you
considering
it
as
a
kolsch
its
really
a
quite
drinkable
session
beer
eh
is
all
i
have
left
to
say
about
this
beer
d
not
bad
pours
a
cloudy
golden
yellow
orangeish
color
with
a
white
head
in
the
aroma
sweet
maltiness
and
almost
lager
like
in
the
taste
dry
to
sweet
maltiness
and
quite
lagerish
a
smooth
with
a
small
bite
in
the
mouthfeel
and
a
small
dry
malty
sweetness
in
the
aftertaste
ok
very
lagerish
throws
me
off
nothing
too
exciting
pours
a
three
finger
white
head
that
fades
slowly
to
thin
layer
leaving
a
good
lace
cloudy
pale
amber
color
light
carbonation
and
light
bodied
slight
hoppy
nose
flavor
has
some
malty
sweetness
but
hops
dominate
which
is
surprising
given
that
the
ibus
are

or
drinkability
this
is
a
refreshing
brew
that
provides
great
flavor
and
unique
character
d
this
is
an
easy
brew
to
drink
long
into
the
night
and
possibly
the
next
day
it
has
a
modest
abv
is
lightly
carbonated
and
neither
the
sweetness
of
the
malts
or
bitterness
of
the
hops
dominates
body
is
light
and
effervescent
although
it
can
be
a
touch
fizzy
if
sipped
hastily
goes
down
easy
and
given
the
low
abv
would
probably
make
a
decent
session
beer
still
it
doesnt
rank
as
one
of
my
favorites
d
moderately
drinkable
a
good
summer
backyard
beer
when
first
poured
the
color
was
a
slightly
haze
golden
yellow
with
very
little
foam
then
after
the
first
smell
it
seemed
that
this
ale
had
a
lot
of
promise
the
smell
of
mild
hops
and
a
fruity
aroma
filled
the
nose
then
it
was
down
hill
after
that
the
taste
was
just
of
a
sourtartbitter
and
not
a
lot
of
hop
flavor
or
any
fruit
what
so
ever
after
each
sip
all
i
got
was
the
sourbittertart
taste
on
the
palate
with
very
litlle
flavor
of
anything
blah
one
more
gulp
and
down
the
sink
certainly
a
session
beer
for
those
who
can
handle
the
hoppiness
of
an
apa
price
wise
this
beer
makes
me
search
out
alleycats
fullmoon
before
visitiing
naughty
nellie
again
though
as
i
drink
this
im
watching
silver
chair
struggle
through
their
new
single
strait
lines
which
i
really
enjoy
on
the
radio
the
singer
cant
hit
the
falsetto
at
all
quickly
switched
to
screaming
and
wow
now
im
not
so
bummed
their
show
at
the
crystal
ballroom
is
sold
out
the
point
is
its
an
interesting
parallel
to
this
beer
as
while
i
applaud
the
effort
but
it
fails
miserably
so
yeah
one
and
done
not
drinkable
to
me
big
thanks
to
lipschitz
for
sending
me
this
canbif
note
my
bottle
says
4
9
abv
and
the
label
is
different
overall
a
great
light
easy
drinking
als
great
on
a
hot
summer
day
this
is
a
beer
that
everyone
will
like
the
taste
was
a
nice
balance
between
bitter
and
sweet
broken
up
with
a
blast
of
hops
in
the
middle
before
finishing
crisp
and
clean
the
carbonation
was
lively
but
not
abrasive
and
medium
body
seemed
right
for
the
style
the
mouth
thins
a
bit
in
the
end
but
this
is
an
easy
drinking
session
beer
nice
to
meet
you
nellie
an
okay
pale
ale
when
all
is
said
and
done
not
worth
the
clams
for
it
when
we
have
decent
micro
pale
ales
brewed
locally
and
regionally
available
for
less
still
its
good
to
see
new
stuff
available
on
the
shelves
as
well
and
i
like
the
name
hazy
golden
pour
with
a
light
head
that
retains
for
the
length
of
the
beer
a
flowery
perfume
hops
with
a
sweet
malt
body
aroma
a
sweet
hops
taste
with
a
bitter
malt
after
taste
a
creamy
feel
with
a
crisp
finish
and
a
sweet
aftertaste
in
all
this
beer
is
very
easy
to
drink
it
has
a
nice
blend
of
flavors
and
a
crisp
quality
that
makes
it
tasty
and
refreshing
drinkability
very
average
i
had
this
on
two
different
days
of
my
trip
and
both
days
i
had
the
same
impression
just
not
impressed
with
this
beer
brought
to
me
from
the
brewery
in
seattle
i
found
this
to
be
a
better
balanced
and
more
drinkable
than
their
standard
pale
ale
very
good
very
pleasant
beer
not
going
to
offend
any
beer
fans
but
may
be
a
bit
difficult
for
people
who
stick
with
lowend
american
beers
to
stomach
it
has
the
malty
backbone
of
a
bohemian
pilsner
mediumgolden
with
a
compact
foamy
white
head
light
grainy
bread
malt
aromas
are
overshadowed
by
lively
spritzy
fresh
citrusy
hops
light
malt
flavors
up
front
grainy
faintly
sweet
big
zesty
hop
splash
fresh
citrusy
juicy
and
bitter
very
thirst
quenching
beer
here
light
bodied
dry
at
first
and
then
juicy
hop
finish
a
nice
session
ale
thats
all
about
fresh
juicy
hops
this
bottle
foamed
over
after
i
popped
the
cap
not
due
to
anything
i
could
controlit
has
been
sitting
upright
unagitated
for
a
week
styrofoam
white
head
chunky
but
not
overly
consistent
the
beer
is
a
fuzzy
nectarine
colour
and
the
head
leaves
rings
of
thick
lacing
the
aroma
is
unexpected
but
delightful
citrusy
belgian
pale
ale
aroma
here
almost
like
the
metallic
tang
of
orval
the
yeast
definitely
plays
a
role
in
the
smell
giving
a
soapiness
and
sourish
fruitiness
a
strange
combination
of
malt
and
little
to
suggest
hops
at
all
the
metallic
and
tart
fruitiness
really
dominates
this
is
not
complex
but
i
enjoy
it
quite
a
bit
pineapple
citrus
and
grapefruit
on
the
mouth
leaving
a
bitterness
like
pomegranate
seeds
light
malts
mingle
with
the
strong
lemon
citrus
and
again
hops
are
not
easy
to
find
in
the
taste
whilst
they
do
leave
the
dryness
the
taste
definitely
has
some
belgian
characteristics
i
would
say
grapefruit
and
lemon
are
the
two
most
detectable
flavours
here
with
the
light
malt
in
the
background
this
possesses
some
similarities
to
hefeweizens
as
well
not
only
in
the
unfiltered
look
but
the
sour
but
revitalising
wheatlike
tastesand
judging
by
the
bottom
of
the
bottle
this
beer
is
unfiltered
the
body
is
medium
and
refreshing
and
the
carbonation
is
average
the
strange
aftertaste
is
unique
for
this
style
and
actually
quite
quaffable
this
is
bit
of
hybrid
in
my
opinionpale

not
quite
describe

take
your

is
the
spice

a
maxim
that
im
sure
applies
to
her
profession
as
much
as
it
applies
to
beer
im
willing
to
cut
her
ale
some
slack
for
its
uniqueness
i
wont
be
buying
it
again

for
a
one

the
aroma
is
that
of

nice
with

along
with

this

an

beers
notes
this
beer
has
2
very
nice
characteristics
that
it
executes
well
one
is
the
hops
and
the
other
is
the
slightly
sweet
biscuity
malt
that
makes
you
want
to
keep
drinking
it
a
very
solid
brew
cheers
it
is
a
slight
cloudy
dark
gold
color
with
a
decent
head
the
aroma
is
slight
sweet
and
there
is
some
floral
and
spicy
hops
in
the
nose
the
body
is
light
but
it
stands
up
well
to
the
bitterness
it
has
some
sweet
maltiness
and
a
slight
citric
taste
there
is
a
bit
too
much
yeastiness
for
my
taste
but
it
is
not
too
bad
it
finishes
pretty
dry
pours
a
bright
auburn
color
with
a
thin
lace
on
the
glass
the
aroma
is
of
mildly
fruity
hops
and
a
hint
of
sweetness
like
the
woman
on
the
label
the
beer
has
a
great
body
with
a
perfectly
balanced
mild
malt
and
spicy
sweet
hop
balance
refreshing
finish
and
extremely
easy
drinking
drinkability

excellent
interpretation
of
the
style
although
the
hopheads
may
be
a
little
disappointed
this
went
down
well
to
start
off
the
night
hazy
copper
with
good
tight
head
and

yummy
sediment
makes
it
cloudy
and
velvety
on
the
tongue
yeasty
aroma
of
must
fruit
i
would
describe
this
as
a
pale
ale
for
lovers
of
yeasty
hefeweizens
not
any
wheat
but
lots
of
fruity
yeast
with
flavors
of
banana
and
apricot
malts
are
complex
with
some
nuts
butter
and
caramel
hops
are
noticeable
but
not
at
all
bitter
just
appealing
and
moreish
incredibly
soft
finish
would
probably
be
awesome
on
a
nottoohot
summer
day
your
girlfriend
may
love
it
a
very
good
and
unique
beer
it
was
definitely
too
fruity
to
be
the
ideal
beer
for
me
but
i
still
liked
it
very
much
slightly
sweet
fruit
nose
sweeter
malt

that
covers
the
tongue
initally
then
you
get
a
nice

juicy

gum
the
brew
finishes
with
a
nice
sharp
hop
bitterness
on
the
back
and
base
of
the
tongue
the
brew
is
balenced
very
nicely
medium

this
is
a

they

a

brew
they
were
right
minus
the
extra
yeast
flavour
this
is
a
good

and
something
id
drink
all

pours
a
very
slightly
hazy
very
slightly

this
is
a
great
summer
brew
lighter
in
body
a
touch
sweet
with
a
nice
hop
presense
to
balance
it
rates
on
the
the
refreshing
scale
as
well
as
in
quaffability
overall
a
notch
better
than
the
average
brand
having
a
little
more
taste
and
body
not
the
worst
beer
in
the
world
but
far
closer
to
it
than
to
the
best
had
a
pitcher
on
tap
in
montreal
tasted
like
a
dirty
diaper
to
me
but
to
each
his
own
so
overall
would
i
recommend
it
for
sure
you
wanna
drink
a
molson
product
take
a
molson
export
this
is
much
better
than
a
molson
dry
or
a
molson
canadian
if
you
are
at
the
bar
and
have
the
chance
to
try
the
molson
export
try
it
are
neighbors
to
the
north
dont
need
to
export
this
one
of
course
they
probably
dont
want
to
drink
it
either
o
a
nice
take
on
the
export
ale
style
though
could
use
a
bit
more
body
but
a
decent
molson
product
nonetheless
when
nothing
else
is
available
its
ok
very
drinkable
especially
after
mowing
the
lawn
this
is
one
of
those
beers
that
tastes
way
better
on
tap
than
in
the
can
i
dont
know
what
causes
that
because
i
am
not
a
professional
canman
good
front
end
and
the
back
gets
a
little
sour
and
syrupy
kinda
like
your
lesser
american
macros
very
nice
front
all
the
way
through
though
and
the
downer
back
end
aint
that
noticeable
in
the
tap
version
its
a
real
bargain
too
the
bell
center
only
charges
11
bucks
a
tall
boy
this
a
good
pretty
good
beer
for
a
macro
but
it
was
first
made
when
it
was
a
microbrewery
it
has
a
great
ale
color
and
smells
fruity
the
taste
ia
awesome
for
a
macro
so
i
think
it
is
above
average
the
mouthfeel
is
like
most
of
the
ales
in
average
it
is
definetly
the
best
ale
you
can
find
everywhere
in
canada
i
like
this
better
than
either
canadian
or
golden
its
very
sessionable
and
less
artifical
tasting
pours
clear
yellow
color
with
a
excited
white
head
over
an
inch
tall
decent
retention
watery
look
overall
but
not
bad
smells
like
pale
malts
very
light
with
ony
some
bittering
hops
in
there
as
to
not
be
offensive
taste
is
the
same
but
i
reckon
a
stiffer
hopping
would
make
this
a
damn
fine
beer
it
seems
to
be
lacking
to
me
and
that
could
really
set
it
off
mouthfeel
is
good
smooth
and
drinkable
lighter
body
but
not
too
light
with
bright
carbonation
sessionable
especially
when
ice
cold
i
dont
mind
this
one
in
the
summer
when
i
am
on
a
budget
molson
makes
a
number
of
abhorrent
beers
and
in
full
fairness
also
have
a
few
passable
offerings
in
their
portfolio
export
in
my
opinion
doesnt
fit
neatly
into
either
of
those
two
camps
its
not
offensive
but
its
far
from
pleasant
i
cant
imagine
any
scenario
where
id
recommend
anyone
buy
this
beer
it
is
distasteful
at
worst
forgettable
at
best
final
thoughts
one
of
molsons
better
offerings
that
is
for
sure
when
i
was
younger
export
wasnt
my
cup
of
tea
as
it
seemed
to
be
a
lot
heavier
and
hoppier
back
then
however
now
it
is
a
suitable
replacement
for
when
only
macros
are
on
tap
molson
export
is
like
most
typical
north
american
beers
it
pours
a
golden
clear
with
initial
big
head
that
dissapates
quickly
the
smell
and
taste
are
mostly
grain
mouthfeel
is
lighter
in
body
with
good
carbonation
overall
it
is
a
decent
beer
that
is
drinkable
nice
crisp
taste
with
a
hoppy
spicy
kick
one
of
my
favorite
styles
of
beer
and
ex
is
a
premier
option
mouthfeel
is
prickly
and
effervescent
my
one
complaint
is
the
beers
flavor
seems
to
diminish
surprisingly
quickly
so
try
to
find
one
with
the
closest
brewed
date
overall
a
decent
macro
that
i
have
always
enjoyed
the
metallic
influence
doesnt
seem
as
good
as
it
used
to
be
still
better
than
labatt
though
on
tap
in
montreal
this
beer
poured
a
golden
color
much
carbonation
is
evident
by
the
bubbles
shiny
white
head
dissipates
quickly
scent
is
a
bit
offputting
not
skunky
just
a
bit
well
macro
smells
like
corn
buttered
corn
taste
was
not
comparative
to
the
smell
much
better
not
great
just
better
the
appeal
for
export
must
be
drinkability
not
taste
mouthfeel
was
a
bit
grainy
and
dry
after
a
while
not
my
favorite
i
was
out
west
for
two
years
and
never
saw
this
stuff
there
ill
admit
to
missing
ex
a
little
bit
during
that
time
it
was
one
of
the
first
beers
i
had
after
coming
back
if
i
am
at
a
pub
that
only
has
the
bare
minimum
of
selection
a
pint
of
export
will
almost
always
be
the
safe
choice
as
far
as
massproduced
canadian
beer
goes
this
is
one
of
the
better
options
and
i
say
this
as
someone
who
is
not
a
fan
of
most
molson
products
at
all
a
favourite
of
a
buddys
usually
consumed
when
at
his
place
outside
in
summer
when
poured
its
a
pal
golden
yellow
with
a
frothy
white
head
nose
is
grain
malt
bit
of
fruit
notes
come
through
and
a
touch
of
alcohol
taste
is
decent
easy
to
down
a
bunch
certainly
tastes
like
youd
expect
a
macro
to
not
much
flavour
most
grain
and
alcohol
light
to
medium
mouthfeel
not
sure
how
he
can
only
drink
this
one
beer
every
single
day
to
each
their
own
overall
i
can
stand
to
have
one
if
i
stop
it
for
a
visit
medium
body
crisp
carbonation
easily
drinkable
a
slightly
more
flavorable
macro
lager
molson
export
pours
a
crystal
clear
bright
gold
with
a
decent
head
that
lingers
nicely
the
aroma
is
faintly
grainy
with
a
bit
of
faint
fruitiness
the
flavor
is
clean
slightly
grainy
and
faintly
astringent
there
is
a
bit
of
bitterness
in
the
finish
overall
there
is
nothing
offensive
about
this
beer
but
its
nothing
special
and
quite
overpriced
here
in
ontario
d
easy
to
drink
not
a
terrible
tasting
beer
overall
pretty
average
d
to
me
this
is
what
a
canadian
beer
should
taste
like
full
flavor
and
not
too
light
worth
a
try
4
99
a
6
pack
of
11
5
ounce
of
brown
bottles
overall
its
a
bit
better
then
molson
canadian
but
still
has
that
mostly
bland
macro
aroma
flavour
when
in
a
bar
that
only
has
generic
macro
available
this
is
one
ill
likely
order
drinkability
this
is
a
beer
to
get
your
drunk
on
and
with
a
few
liter
cans
its
pretty
easy
to
accomplish
and
its
not
that
bad
tasting
a
beer
while
you
wait
for
the
alcohol
to
hit
your
brain
ok
enough
for
something
with
its
heritage
i
had
no
problem
drinking
this
unlike
its
extended
family
i
see
theyve
modified
the
logo
which
is
a
blue
sailing
ship
it
used
to
look
a
lot
like
an
armidillo
when
you
tipped
the
bottle
and
viewed
the
ship
on
its
side
i
was
actually
impressed
to
see
an
apa
come
out
of
molson
brewing
not
my
favorite
but
a
valiant
effort
consistent
with
the
albeit
open
ended
apa
style
drinkability
drinkability
is
strong
good
refreshment
while
not
being
boring
an
ok
choice
for
a
session
beer
for
sure
notes
this
is
a
sortof
guilty
pleasure
beer
for
me
i
usually
drink
it
right
from
the
bottle
and
its
better
that
way
pouring
it
into
a
glass
shows
its
true
lack
of
character
from
a
frosty
cold
bottle
its
a
different
story
needs
to
be
icecold
the
mouthfeel
for
this
beer
is
a
really
evenbalance
beer
light
and
a
bit
crisp
okay
for
what
it
is
mainly
inoffensive
but
nothing
particularly
special
or
tasty
extremely
drinkable
one
of
the
best
bad
beers
ive
had
wont
have
this
again
decent
beer
with
an
identity
crisis
pours
darker
yellow
with
a
white
head
bright
aroma
of
saaz
and
crystal
malt
it
has
a
bit
of
a
bite
like
an
ale
but
is
sweet
like
a
lager
enjoyable
not
great
but
i
cant
really
say
that
ive
had
a
apa
of
this
style
bottle
12
oz
pours
a
very
pale
golden
color
thick
lasting
head
looks
like
many
other
beers
when
poured
strong
hop
aroma
good
smooth
flavor
with
no
strong
aftertaste
no
distinct
taste
its
a
good
tasting
and
drinkable
beer
but
nothing
about
it
really
stands
out
notes
this
is
one
of
my
favorite
beers
from
the
big
breweries
its
always
good
on
a
hot
summer
day
and
also
makes
for
a
good
hockey
watching
beer
honestly
this
beer
is
slightly
better
than
the
other
beers
that
are
widely
available
at
bars
in
its
class
i
love
canadian
love
dry
and
hell
even
laurentide
is
better
than
this
this
tastes
like
a
strangely
unbalanced
macro
lager
rather
than
an
ale
if
youre
looking
for
a
good
canadian
macro
ale
id
go
with
labatt
50
much
better
i
know
this
isnt
longtrail
or
coopers
but
molson
gets
kd
for
this
one
nothing
too
exceptional
here
although
i
think
there
might
be
a
bit
of
an
identity
crisis
going
on
here
says
american
pale
ale
but
smells
and
goes
down
like
a
lager
were
the
little
beasties
on
top
or
bottom
anyway
tastes
just
about
like
a
molson
to
me
light
hops
and
a
lot
of
carbonation
not
a
bad
beer
but
not
my
favourite
notes
this
beer
is
spectacularly
unspectacular
the
taste
just
is
not
there
but
to
look
at
that
positively
it
really
contains
no
offensive
tastes
its
pretty
good
if
you
just
want
to
drink
for
the
hell
of
it
or
if
nothing
else
is
available
to
you
i
certainly
prefer
it
to
most
canadian
macros
and
definately
would
take
it
over
a
canadian
a
safe
enough
choice
if
there
arent
any
micro
brews
in
site
but
that
stink
ugh
when
i
think
molson
export
i
think
of
two
things
canadiens
hockey
and
creamed
corn
its
palatable
but
some
such
as
myself
might
find
it
too
sweet
and
unbalanced
it
didnt
smell
all
that
great
didnt
taste
all
that
great
and
was
not
an
instant
favourite
at
least
it
looked
like
beer
but
not
one
i
would
recommend
to
friends
or
beer
lovers
anywhere
molson
export
is
fairly
standard
for
a
macro
its
miles
ahead
of
the
flagships
of
canadian
macro
brewing
canadian
and
blue
but
thats
about
the
only
accolade
im
willing
to
give
it
on
cheap
drink
night
at
a
crappy
bar
i
might
have
a
couple
but
otherwise
id
take
pretty
much
anything
else
even
a
rickards
red
or
kokanee
would
be
infinitely
more
palatable
still
theres
something
about
the
ex
that
brings
out
a
sense
of
nostalgia
in
me
and
thats
why
every
once
in
awhile
maybe
only
once
a
year
i
grab
a
sixpack

is
a

the

contains
a

edge
of

d
could
drink
a
couple
without
thinking
about
it
but
it
does
leave
some
unwanted
tastes
in
your
mouth
definitely
not
an
allnighter
the
old
standby
without
molson
export
there
is
no
way
i
would
have
been
able
to
get
my
masters
done
when
i
lived
in
albany
ny
i
first
discovered
this
beer
while
broke
and
thirsty
while
not
the
best
beer
in
the
world
by
any
strech
it
is
however
imo
the
best
beer
for
one
on
a
budget
nice
golden
color
but
not
much
head
and
it
quickly
disipates
nice
flavor
with
some
actual
taste
no
mistaking
this
for
water
what
really
sells
this
beer
for
me
is
drinkability
and
price
overall
it
goes
down
smooth
and
has
enough
flavor
to
enjoy
one
can
tell
its
a
macro
but
one
can
also
see
that
it
has
a
bit
more
flavor
than
most
run
of
the
mill
beers
it
could
be
nostalgia
it
might
be
the
taste
heck
its
probably
a
little
bit
of
both
but
i
love
this
beer
its
tough
to
buy
in
the
states
unless
you
find
yourself
up
north
very
easy
to
find
in
maine
nh
and
vt
anywhere
else
good
luck
if
you
see
it
grab
a
six
of
the
red
cap
itd
be
a
very
good
beer
id
drink
this

ever

the
beer
has

good
as
yuengling
in
the
macro
category
but
ill
take
it
over
a
bud
or
coors
any
day
ballantines
is
an
affirmation
that
real
hop
flavor
existed
in
beer
well
before
the
craft
boom
and
that
heritage
beers
are
not
automatically
shadows
of
what
they
should
be
its
clean
refreshing
and
has
real
flavor
i
was
truly
surprised
and
said
wow
out
loud
several
times
with
my
first
pint
can
while
its
not
quite
on
the
hop
level
of
a
contemporary
apa
ballantine
really
has
a
similar
feel
to
it
will
try
again
when
i
get
the
chance
o
this
beer
came
in
a
green
bottle
so
that
might
explain
the
bits
of
skunk
that
i
picked
up
in
the
smell
and
taste
of
this
beer
however
its
not
bad
for
a
macro
beer
and
doesnt
have
much
in
the
way
of
adjuncts
in
the
smell
and
taste
it
also
doesnt
seem
to
be
as
bland
as
other
blonde
ales
d
surprisingly
enjoyable
once
you
get
past
the
skunky
aroma
id
much
prefer
to
drink
this
over
pbr
or
other
adjunct
lagers
particularly
if
canned
or
kegged
very
much
a
lawnmower
beer
that
wouldnt
offend
anyone
not
particularly
complex
but
significantly
better
than
anticipated
i
drank
this
in
college
early
80s
but
did
not
recall
the
flavor
today
liking
the
full
range
of
ales
i
found
and
purchased
this
locally
at
finger
lakes
beverage
ballantine
is
one
of
my
favorite
beers
sure
it
does
not
have
the
punch
of
heartier
ales
but
thats
not
what
this
beer
is
instead
its
clean
very
dry
and
light
in

good
for
drinking
several
at

though
a
shadow
of
its

self

the
poor
relative
to
the
legendary
ballantine

which
was
phenomenal
a
nice
lowpriced
ale
very
drinkable
especially
on
hot
days
i
spent
a
year
in
england
about
then
obviously
the
english
bitters
were
different
but
i
cant
say
i
liked
the
run
of
the
mill
ones
better
only
certain
ones
like
abott
ale
and
just
about
everything
brewed
in
yorkshire
cant
believe
this
beer
got
the
ratings
it
did
flavor
is
neutral
aroma
skunky
o
its
not
the

brew
i
remember
from
the
early
70s
in
north
jersey
i
didnt
know
what
hops
were
then
but
i
knew
i
liked
the
flavor
of
ballantine
xxx
which
i
learned
many
decades
later
used
hop
oil
extract
this
beer
could
use
some
of
that
but
even
so
i
enjoyed
this
more
than
most

very
good

a

you
see

really
is
just

of

average

forgettable
o
its
not
bad
ive
got
five
more
that
i
dont
think
ill
have
a
problem
to
eventually
drink
but
dont
think
id
buy
this
again
ballantine
ale
is
primarily
a
ne
east
coast
regional
brew
this
2012
version
is
owned
by
pabst
sub
brewed
by
miller
the
overall
impression
is
a
much
hoppiermaltier
profile
than
your
average
adjunct
i
would
rate
it
as
one
of
the
best
adjuncts
available
right
up
there
with
schlitz
gusto
i
avoid
the
green
bottles
and
buy
it
in
tall
boy
cans
to
ensure
no
skunk
flavors
unclear
why
pabst
does
not
distro
this
nationwide
as
i
think
it
would
sell
well
d
this
is
an
interesting
beer
id
be
shocked
if
this
werent
actually
a
lager
i
actually
found
this
pretty
similar
to
yuenglings
lord
chesterfield
though
this
has
a
more
european
hop
character
my
curiosity
got
the
best
of
when
i
picked
this
up
but
at
least
its
drinkable
o
a
beer
i
always
enjoy
anytime
of
the
year
i
really
wanted
to
like
this
in
the
end
i
couldnt
even
enjoy
it
yuk
i
tried
this
once
in
the
40z
form
of
course
wasnt
overly
thrilled
with
it
though
its
so
so
i
have
heard
though
the
ballantine
lager
was
good
though
sad
to
say
they
dont
make
it
anymore
oh
well
over
all
if
you
want
a
cheap
ale
with
some
nostalgia
get
a
ballantine
o
considering
what
this
this
it
really
isnt
bad
it
does
taste
like
a
watered
down
pale
ale
not
all
that
good
but
i
think
it
has
more
character
than
popular
adjunct
lagers
this
poured
a
clear
golden
yellow
with
white
foamy
head
scent
was
a
touch
skunky
so
i
let
it
rest
a
bit
before
drinking
surprisingly
good
despite
scent
bready
malt
grassy
hops
a
bit
tinny
though
but
not
bad
overall
its
got
that
golden
flavor
true
ale
flavor
its
a
bit
sad
such
a
famous
beer
has
been
tanked
its
quality
diminished
as
the
brand
has
been
shuffled
from
brewery
to
brewery
eventually
arriving
at
such
a
pitiful
state
ah
well
has
a
thin
sickly
yellow
pour
with
weak
soapy
head
that
fades
instantly
the
nose
is
similar
to
the
armpit
of
a
man
who
just
completed
his
first
bungee
jump
skunky
and
disturbing
the
flavor
doesnt
disappoint
like
many
skunks
were
rounded
up
and
then
distilled
by
squeezing
them
in
a
coffee
press
water
grass
and
a
hint
of
urine
round
out
this
beverage
watery
body
with
spotty

drunk
if
your
homeless
or
aspire
to
be
so
in
the
near
future
d
at
this
point
the
best
40
ive
consumed
to
date
ran
out
of
chesterfield
and
saw
this
at
the
local
distributor
always
wanted
to
give
it
a
try
but
a
tough
call
because
its
a
bit
pricier
than
the
macros
what
if
i
dont
like
it
what
if
she
doesnt
call
me
back
in
the
end
i
manned
up
and
bought
the
case
it
pours

head
dissipates
and
leaves
behind

its

smell
is

a
bit
of
sugar
too
and
some
citrus
theres
some
sweetness
and
hops
there
nice
aroma
taste
is
decent
macroish
but
a
lot
more
hops
are
present
now
this
is
an
apa
and
it
doesnt
have
the
hop
bill
of
snpa
or
sam
adams
boston
ale
but
what
am
i
judging
this
against
in
a
pinch
ill
take
yuenglings
lord
chesterfield
over
this
but
both
are
poseur
craft
beers
with
crisp
carbonation
appreciable
hop
bitterness
and
easy
drinkability
definitely
start
keeping
this
beer
on
rotation
in

easily

tastes
of
pale
malt
grain
and
slight
citrus
hops
overall
akin
to
a
light
lager
with
extra
hop
there
is
a
restaurant
in
purdys
ny
called
the
blazer
pub
some
of
the
best
burgers
in
the
ny
tristate
area
and
a
regular
stop
for
me
well
recently
they
decided
to
go
retro
and
are
now
offering
in
cans
schaefer
ballantine
rheingold
and
schlitz
with
pbr
on
tap
whether
you
like
these
beers
or
not
the
concept
tickled
my
fancy
and
i
decided
to
make
my
way
through
the
list
revisiting
some
of
the
beers
of
my
youth
none
of
them
are
great
in
fact
most
of
them
are
poor
in
comparison
to
the
captain
lawrence
offerings
that
the
blazer
also
has
on
tap
but
you
know
what
they
were
like
an
old
friend
a
blankie
that
i
could
hold
at
the
bar
and
not
feel
self
conscious
about
yes
i
drank
them
all
proudly
and
chances
are
i
will
again
had
a
bottle
for
5
50
at
old
town
bar
near
union
square
surprisingly
not
bad
there
is
legitimate
citrus
hop
flavor
in
this
beer
i
mean
not
much
and
it
sort
of
blends
into
a
dull
white
bread
malt
character
but
its
there
not
very
bitter
but
an
improvement
on
the
cream
ale
and
macro
lager
if
i
came
across
a
cheap
case
of
this
certainly
not
another
bar
charging
5
50
id
pick
a
case
for
a
party
d
tasty
goes
down
very
easily
not
filling
at
all
mild
kick
decent
representation
of
style
for
an
inexpensive
alternative
this
beer
isnt
a
bad
choice
but
over
all
there
are
a
lot
of
other
beers
in
the
style
that
are
better
basically
it
sucks
pours
a
really
pale
golden
color
with
a
thinnish
white
head
that
spends
almost
no
time
atop
my
beer
smells
of
straw
honey
corn
skunk
hints
of
earthy
hops
taste
is
a
little
sweet
with
a
grainy
edge
and
a
faint
hop
bite
has
a
bit
more
fruity
character
than
a
macro
lager
but
is
otherwise
very
similar
medium
to
thin
body
sweet
grainy
mouthfeel
crisp
carbonation
easy
drinker
but
certainly
nothing
special
the
best
part
of
this
beer
is
the
puzzles
under
the
caps
taste
is
not
at
all
appalling
but
still
not
all
that
flavorful
grainy
and
bready
malt
body
with
some
slight
hoppy
flower
notes
but
really
this
is
all
a
bit
watered
down
and
a
bit
metalic
mouthfeel
is
crisp
and
full
of
carbonation
overall
not
a
bad
macro
beer
at
a
good
price
point
green
halfquart
can
with
a
batch
code
on
the
side
and
a
freshness
date
on
the
bottom
dryhopped
with
cascade
and
brewed
by
falstaff
brewing
co
not
pabst
pours
a
light
yellowgold
with
medium
carbonation
and
an
inch
of
frothy
white
head
that
doesnt
really
leave
any
lacing
fairly
aromatic
with
light
malts
citric
orange
zest
and
perhaps
some
pine
very
flavorful
as
well
with
sweet
corn
a
minerally
industrial
twang
and
a
dash
of
sulfur
forming
the
base
topped
with
layers
of
citric
resiny
piney
almost
woodsy
hops
that
impart
a
mild
but
noticeable
bitterness
very
cleanly
fermented
with
just
a
hint
of
ethanol
its
body
is
crisp
tingly
and
dry
but
a
touch
too
heavy
for
mass
consumption
this
is
a
great
light
beer
that
has
become
a
staple
in
my
fridge
while
it
isnt
really
an
apa
more
of
an
american
adjunct
ale
i
imagine
this
is
very
similar
to
what
preprohibition
beers
tasted
like
make
sure
not
to
drink
this
too
cold
because
light
beers
dont
get
any
more
flavorful
than
this
imagine
having
cascadeflavored
burps
from
a
macrobrew
while
i
have
not
had
this
out
of
the
bottle
i
dont
think
i
ever
would
because
they
use
green
glass
regardless
of
whether
or
not
you
like
light
beers
if
you
find
this
in
the
can
buy
it
i
highly
recommend
it
if
only
to
see
that
not
all
massproduced
beer
is
flavorless
swill
its
actually
not
bad
at
all
the
smell
is
of
some
hop
and
grain
the
taste
gives
you
a
quick
flash
of
subtle
citrus
hop
right
up
front
and
ends
with
a
dissolving
hop
grain
taste
it
smells
and
tastes
like
a
semi
watered
down
sierra
nevada
pale
ale
that
was
my
first
impression
on
smelling
and
tasting
this
beer
obviously
the
sierra
nevada
pale
ale
has
more
solid
tastier
bitter
hops
and
a
way
nicer
malt
taste
but
this
really
does
this
trick
if
you
cant
afford
sierra
drinkablity
is
very
nice
not
filling
and
lower
alcohol
content
this
is
definitely
beats
out
budweiser
miller
and
coors
this
beer
seemed
like
a
beer
bursting
with
taste
right
after
i
just
drank
a
miller
lite
but
then
i
guess
a
lot
of
beers
have
more
taste
than
that
but
the
big
3
all
taste
the
same
to
me
anyways
probably
the
only
thing
ill
drink
from
pabst
because
it
has
the
most
hop
character
out
of
any
cheaper
mass
produced
beer
out
there
hands
down
put
this
in
a
brown
bottle
load
these
big
babies
up
in
a
big
cooler
and
slap
some
chicken
and
ribs
on
the
grill
drinkability
a
very
boring
pale
ale
this
beer
isnt
terrible
but
its
basically
a
lesswatered
down
adjunct
beer
if
the
big
macro
companies
made
ales
i
can
imagine
this
is
about
what
it
would
taste
like
not
a
bad
beer
at
all
this
is
an
overly
herbal
brew
accentuated
by
the
high
carbonation
level
which
makes
my
mouth
burn
the
overall
taste
presentation
and
mouthfeel
speak
to
the
stereotypical
canned
adjunct
beer
theres
soemthing
a
bit
off
a
bit
unpleasant
i
can
appreciate
the
size
v
cost
aspect
of
this
beer
but
in
as
i
am
in
ri
the
gansett
will
not
be
replaced
by
this
drinkability
very
enjoyable
and
drinkable
could
see
this
being
a
great
and
affordable
alot
better
beer
than
alot
of
people
would
expect
and
for
a
macro
beer
one
of
great
enjoyable
flavor
it
does
its
history
proud
a
session
american
beer
from
the
time
past
thats
still
better
than
alot
still
thriving
this
isnt
a
beer
i
would
try
again
in
fact
i
think
i
gave
myself
a
headache
trying
to
smell
and
taste
more
than
what
this
beer
had
to
offer
rjt
after
landing
in
philly
then
driving
out
to
cape
may
new
jersey
i
was
ready
for
a
beer
cape
may
however
is
not
the
mecca
of
beer
that
many
cities
are
i
stopped
in
a
packy
and
picked
up
a
sixer
of
this
one
in
the
neon
green
cans
i
walked
out
to
the
beach
behind
the
hotel
and
with
a
roast
beef
sandwich
i
picked
up
at
the
wawa
i
enjoyed
a
couple
for
a
pabst
product
this
one
was
nicely
hopped
balanced
and
very
enjoyable
earth
shattering
no
but
if
this
one
was
sold
in
denver
it
would
always
be
in
my
fridge
drank
from
a
12
ounce
bottle
with
freshness
date
of
jan
42010
i
decided
it
would
be
okay
to
go
ahead
and
drink
this
brew
from
the
bottle
claims
on
the
bottle
to
be
americas
largest
selling
ale
i
have
to
wonder
about
this
not
much
of
a
scent
smooth
flavor
sweet
and
somewhat
herbal
notes
dominate
the
flavor
profile
mouthfeel
is
very
smooth
and
pretty
easy
to
drink
i
could
easily
have
a
couple
more
of
these
mouthdrink
nice
body
its
crisp
and
clean
drinkability
is
nice
a
very
drinkable
old
style
beer
and
its
a
damn
bargain
the
pour
is
the
standard
pale
yellow
with
a
burst
of
fizzy
carbonation
on
top
that
diminishes
to
a
thin
ring
ergh
you
get
that
light
struckgreen
bottle
skunkiness
in
the
aroma
but
once
you
get
around
that
there
are
some
corny
malts
in
there
the
mouthfeel
is
of
medium
texture
a
bit
chewy
and
carbonated
the
taste
is
the
classic
pilsener
style
of
the
past
with
adjuncts
breadiness
and
a
dash
of
dried
hops
and
even
something
vaguely
sweet
it
goes
down
quickly
ballantines
history
fascinated
more
than
the
actual
beer
not
for
the
craft
drinker
more
for
the
drinkerdrinker
i
like
oldfashioned
things
so
this
brand
appealed
to
my
sense
of
nostalgia
i
tried
it
in
maine
several
years
ago
and
it
does
seem
that
its
changed
in
the
past
few
years
its
hard
to
find
in
my
parts
but
i
smoked
it
out
at
a
distributor
in
white
plains
ny
i
agree
with
much
of
the
other
reviewer
commentary
this
is
a
decent
beer
but
not
worth
going
out
of
your
way
for
my
nostalgia
was
not
really
rewarded
it
has
a
bit
of
a
rotgut
alcoholfortified
taste
to
it
im
disappointed
but
cant
really
slam
this
beer
it
does
seem
that
the
current
offering
may
be
treading
on
an
earlier
versions
fame
and
quality
but
it
does
have
a
distinctive
taste
you
might
like
it
its
worth
a
try
esp
if
you
can
find
the
tallboy
cans
usually
in
the
cooler
they
seem
to
move
faster
than
the
6pack
12
oz
bottles
which
look
like
they
gather
a
lot
of
dust
at
retail
and
it
wont
bust
your
beer
or
microwave
burrito
budget
for
the
price
in
times
when
money
is
tight
its
a
great
bargain
those
old
enough
to
remember
original
ballantine
will
agree
that
it
would
probably
rate
a
solid
a
from
most
real
beer
lovers
the
current
version
certainly
falls
short
of
that
ballantine
is
one
of
the
best
mass
produced
beers
popular
in
its
hayday
ballantine
is
now
in
the
nostalgia
category
with
pbr
and
schaefer
etc
but
dont
be
fooled
this
fine
ale
can
win
over
some
beer
advocates
hearts
i
poured
it
out
of
the
can
which
i
prefer
over
the
bottle
it
tastes
alot
better
out
of
the
can
its
color
is
pale
golden
and
its
smell
is
that
of
a
german
pale
lager
a
bit
skunky
with
a
bitter
hop
edge
to
it
it
leaves
a
decent
head
but
its
pretty
irrelevant
with
this
beer
as
it
does
not
contribute
to
the
smell
or
flavor
really
its
really
easy
to
drink
great
summertime
sessions
beer
but
keep
it
in
the
can
and
easy
to
transport
in
a
cooler
do
yourself
a
favor
get
in
it
in
the
can
and
pour
some
out
for
your
four
legged
friend
poured
from
a
green
12
oz
bottle
has
a
golden
color
with
a
12
inch
head
smell
is
of
grains
malts
some
sweetness
taste
is
a
pleasant
surprise
malts
are
abundant
however
there
is
a
nice
hop
balance
feels
medium
bodied
in
the
mouth
and
overall
this
is
a
very
easy
drinking
beer
and
a
great
value
for
the
price
d
not
a
very
good
brew
i
tried
it
hoping
for
a
classic
but
it
fell
short
of
that
ill
part
company
with
the
bros
on
this
one
and
just
say
that
this
is
a
pretty
bad
beer
it
pours
a
pretty
pale
color
with
a
small
but
decent
white
foamy
head
that
does
retain
a
bit
no
lacing
the
nose
has
a
sharp
mustiness
to
it
and
a
slightly
lagery
aroma
the
head
isnt
all
that
enticing
the
taste
is
a
bit
oily
but
sharp
and
tart
with
some
off
soury
notes
with
some
watery
grains
lurking
underneath
there
is
a
cooked
veggie
flavor
to
this
beer
and
it
isnt
good
ive
had
enough
and
i
cant
think
of
too
much
to
recommend
this
beer
d
not
bad
for
the
price
4
99
6pk
bottles
nothing
special
but
respectable
none
the
less
comes
in
half
quarts
thats
pretty
neat
i
paid
one
dollar
and
twenty
five
cents
i
sort
of
like
this
i
didnt
want
to
but
oddly
enough
im
drinking
this
beer
and
am
happy
about
it
smells
pretty
skunky
though
and
grainy
the
skunky
but
its
also
very
well
malted
get
a
hint
of
aluminum
but
not
too
much
the
brewery
has
been
around
for
a
very
long
long
time
in
the
us
so
it
has
to
be
good
right
well
honestly
its
a
whole
lot
better
than
anything
coors
or
ab
puts
out
very
nice
mouthfeel
and
easy
drinking
i
guess
a
go
to
beer
i
cant
find
anything
about
the
abv
on
the
internets
go
figure
gold
colored
beer
with
a
fluffy
white
head
that
fades
very
quickly
aroma
and
taste
to
me
are
both
macro
like
and
i
think
thats
a
good
thing
i
bought
a
12
pack
of
40s
for
24
00
which
seems
to
be
a
decent
buy
its
crisp
and
refreshing
a
perfect
summertime
beer
tastes
good
it
almost
tastes
like
a
corona
if
corona
was
good
but
this
beer
is
much
better
now
this
is
an
ale
but
alot
of
people
think
it
tastes
a
little
like
some
lagers
the
taste
was
good
with
a
nice
balance
of
sweetness
which
i
can
detect
and
some
hops
which
i
can
detect
even
with
my
limited
skills
i
can
detect
some
malted
something
but
i
am
developing
my
skills
so
one
day
i
will
do
a
rereview
drinkability
im
impressed
this
is
a
definite
goto
session
beer
this
one
is
definitely
ideal
for
warm
weather
i
feel
this
could
be
one
of
those
gateway
beers
when
trying
to
convince
friends
that
there
is
more
to
the
world
of
beer
than
bud
and
coors
light
also
at
a
very
affordable
price
old
school
favorite
grabbing
a
6pack
of
16oz
ballantines
would
make
a
great
companion
for
say
a
fishing
outing
or
to
throw
in
the
cooler
for
a
trip
to
the
beach
its
got
that
certain
old
school
novelty
feel
to
it
but
is
actually
a
decent
brew
was
having
nostalgia
for
this
beer
for
some
reason
though
i
ve
drank
less
then
a
case
of
this
in
my
life
bought
a
40
since
they
had
no
six
packs
let
it
sit
a
day
for
some
reason
this
beer
has
never
smelled
good
but
its
the
taste
that
counts
right
poured
it
into
my
pint
glass
nice
looking
head
but
first
yellow
beer
i
drank
in
i
dont
know
when
taste
excellent
might
have
to
stock
up
on
this
stuff
im
sure
my
60
dollar
a
week
beer
bill
will
go
down
and
still
have
a
great
tasting
beer
ale
whatever
the
aroma
is
soda
water
yeast
corn
funk
and
metal
the
appearance
is
pale
gold
with
a
decent
head
the
flavor
is
like
the
aroma
the
palate
is
watery
overall
its
not
good
you
can
do
much
better
than
this
but
of
course
most
of
us
are
just
getting
a
rating
had
this
one
before
figure
ill
drink
it
or
pour
it
depends
how
this
goes
to
remove
it
from
the
cellar
instant
skunkitude
from
the
pour
and
first
whiff
damned
green
bottles
the
taste
isnt
much
better
theres
really
nothing
there
except
for
a
watery
skunky
taste
the
rest
of
this
is
getting
dumped
not
worth
it
americas
largest
selling
ale
the
lime
green
can
told
me
why
did
i
doubt
this
out
of
the
half
quart
of
metal
this
beer
was
a
pale
gold
color
with
a
tremendous
three
finger
head
of
cream
foam
the
retention
was
average
and
it
left
chunks
of
scattered
albeit
thin
lacing
the
aroma
was
slightly
musty
and
dry
typical
american
macro
lager
very
grainy
and
very
generic
the
flavors
were
better
at
first
a
flash
of
semisweet
pale
malt
with
a
nice
grainy
center
that
faded
into
a
bitter
leafy
hop
finish
that
was
crisp
and
rather
refreshing
the
body
was
medium
the
carbonation
perfect
and
smooth
and
the
mouthfeel
very
pleasant
but
a
little
oily
much
better
than
i
was
expecting
andor
the
aroma
suggests
d
this
is
a
classic
old
school
beer
one
which
i
am
proud
to
keep
in
my
beer
fridge
on
a
regular
basis
dont
just
save
this
one
for
mowing
your
lawn
when
i
read
americas
largest
selling
ale
on
the
bottle
i
thought
i
was
doomed
its
not
that
bad
though
its
golden
in
color
with
initially
a
pretty
thick
white
head
that
tapers
away
but
a
thin
head
stays
a
slightly
floral
aroma
but
not
much
to
it
taste
is
slightly
sweet
malt
with
a
very
mild
hop
balance
easy
enough
to
drink
and
relatively
refreshing
notching
it
one
step
above
standard
crap
swill
d
basic
macro
lager
but
it
goes
down
like
water
mfd
thin
bodied
with
pleanty
of
carbonation
to
give
you
tongue
a
slight
sizzle
a
great
old
school
classic
brew
much
better
than
any
of
the
u
s
macros
and
you
get
a
little
puzzle
under
the
cap
to
work
on
while
you
enjoy
your
brew
what
more
can
you
ask
for

mouthfeel
was
medium
to
light
bodied
zesty
carbonation
with
some
slickness
this
is
an
apa
but
it
surely
resembles
a
smaller
market
macro
lager
like
iron
city
this
old
favorite
is
something
i
dont
see
too
often
any
more
especially
in
a
can
so
i
had
to
run
a
quick
review
the
color
is
fairly
consistent
with
the
bottle
dirty
gold
with
a
fair
white
head
and
a
little
lace
the
aroma
is
a
little
anemic
but
there
is
a
mild
hops
bitterness
present
it
has
a
smooth
light
citrus
and
grass
hops
flavor
a
little
dry
at
the
end
tastes
similar
to
the
bottle
an
easy
drinking
option
and
very
refreshing
as
always
fine
i
highly
recomend
giving
this
fine
old
type
american
ale
a
try
i
am
glad
after
all
these
years
i
revisited
it
it
poured
with
a
fingers
worth
of
bonewhite
head
that
reduced
to
wisps
in
no
time
at
all
the
color
was
a
bright
light
gold
with
nequality
clarity
the
nose
had
an
interestingly
sharp
hoppiness
to
it
not
quite
as
snappy
as
saaz
but
still
sharp
the
mouthfeel
was
medium
with
a
light
hop
flavor
on
the
tongue
the
finish
was
dry
and
refreshing
i
am
a
sucker
for
the
old
school
beers
and
i
often
take
ballantine
to
tailgate
parties
when
i
cannot
find
iron
city
mouthfeel
and
drinkability
thin
and
watery
in
the
mouth
overall
very
disappointing
this
is
a
beer
ill
never
come
back
to
if
youre
looking
for
a
craft
beer
it
can
not
be
found
here
maybe
if
this
beer
was
actually
made
from
barley
malt
instead
of
rice
it
would
have
some
flavor
and
weight
to
it
but
alas
drinkability
is
solid
overall
i
only
bought
one
this
time
but
i
could
see
this
as
a
great
6pack
to
accompany
a
social
activity
theres
not
much
else
here
that
would
fit
the
style
its
drinkable
but
thin
at
the
same
time
ive
seen
much
much
better
pale
ales
out
there
pours
a
clear
golden
color
with
a
medium
and
fizzy
white
head
that
dissipates
steadily
stringy
lacing
grainy
malt
aroma
with
some
corn
and
weirdsmelling
hops
lightbodied
with
tart
sour
fruit
earthy
malt
and
light
hops
the
finish
is
more
grain
and
malt
with
an
offtasting
hops
aftertaste
very
one
dimensional
and
barely
above
a
drain
pour
pours
a
pale
yellow
color
with
a
small
head
that
dissipates
quickly
and
leaves
little
or
no
lacing
poured
from
a
bottle
into
a
pint
glass
has
a
fairly
faint
aroma
to
it
sightly
grainy
at
best
with
a
hint
of
hops
the
taste
was
a
little
less
than
i
expected
once
again
very
grainy
with
the
slight
taste
of
hops
to
give
it
some
balance
kind
of
a
boring
taste
has
a
light
mouthfeel
to
it
with
a
good
amount
of
carbonation
overall
not
that
impressive
of
a
beer
try
one
if
you
cant
find
anything
better
better
than
bud
light
not
as
good
as
miller
high
life
drinkability
this
would
be
a
nice
summertime
beer
love
the
color
and
design
of
the
ballantine
can
approx
2
50
40
oz
green
screw
top
bomber
pours
very
light
almost
yellow
and
clear
with
no
head
to
speak
of
immediate
funky
hop
aromas
tickle
my
nose
along
with
some
acrid
sweetness
and
corn
grains
on
the
palate
pretty
sweet
up
front
with
corn
flavors
with
just
a
touch
of
carbonation
and
bitterness
for
bracing
the
finish
is
only
offdry
and
this
beer
sticks
to
your
mouth
with
that
macro
aftertaste
that
i
cant
describe
any
better
than
that
light
in
mouthfeel
average
for
a
macro
overall
this
is
certainly
a
macro
style
beer
but
i
find
it
strangely
compelling
i
would
actually
drink
this
if
no
better
options
were
available
its
pretty
smooth
has
a
bit
of
sweetness
and
in
spite
of
the
obvious
presence
of
grain
adjuncts
isnt
a
corn
bomb
like
a
certain
popular
mexican
beer
not
too
bad
12oz
green
bottle
obtained
at
the
local
hannaford
pours
a
very
light
yellow
body
with
a
thin
film
of
white
head
cereal
grains
characterize
the
aroma
very
reminiscent
of
an
american
macrostyle
lager
tastes
somewhat
sweet
with
cereal
grain
and
just
a
hint
of
grassy
floral
hops
toward
the
finish
very
light
mouthfeel
with
plenty
of
carbonation
a
supereasy
drinker
not
very
challenging
or
heavy
not
a
horrible
beer
but
is
not
at
all
good
for
an
apa
as
a
macrostyle
lager
or
a
cream
ale
this
is
a
solid
beer
simple
drinkable
adjunct
characteristics
but
this
is
no
apa
wouldnt
touch
this
again
if
it
was
the
last
beer
on
earth
the
taste
is
sweetish
malty
up
front
with
some
graininess
and
just
a
wee
bit
of
bitterness
right
before
the
finish
that
could
easily
get
over
looked
and
the
finish
itself
thats
on
the
watery
side
and
probably
the
weakest
taste
feature
for
this
apa
i
remember
this
brew
from
back
in
the
70s
and
80s
and
it
had
a
really
nice
hop
bitterness
bite
to
it
that
threw
the
flavours
totally
out
of
balance
but
thats
what
made
it
so
darn
tasty
i
really
miss
that
old
formula
but
this
one
is
pretty
good
as
well
if
i
had
it
in
my
market
id
visit
it
often
overall
its
a
pretty
nice
beer
much
better
than
yuengling
but
its
really
all
about
the
brand
right
look
its
not
pretty
its
not
hopped
to
hell
and
it
drinking
it
at
a
party
probably
wont
get
you
laid
but
its
american
its
old
school
as
shit
and
i
like
it
fairly
smooth
and
easy
to
drink
however
it
really
wasnt
much
of
an
apa
reminded
me
more
of
a
cream
ale
perhaps
anyway
theres
nothing
great
about
it
very
basic
a
bit
too
bland
for
me
but
again
nothing
offensive
and
not
a
terrible
choice
for
4
bucks
a
sixpack
wish
i
hadnt
wasted
my
1
50
on
this
one
dont
you
waste
yours
too
appears
a
light
golden
tone
and
forms
a
large
white

fine
lacing
behind
on
the
fluted
glass
aroma
is
of
some
semi
skunked
herbal
toned
hops
with
a
touch
of
fruitiness
among
light
toasted
grain
and
an
adjunct
mix
of
corn
and
rice
thats
evident
taste
is
strong
with
a
cloying
sweetness
adjunct
ridee
with
evident
alcohol
presence
and
a
very
low
bitterness
touch
of
mineral
character
and
her
skunked

is
light
bodied
with
fizzy
carbonation
drinkability
some
have
a
sentimental
outlook
on
this
brew
not
me
nothing
classic
about
it
hey
its
89
cents
so
i
grabbed
it
and
its
americas
largest
selling
ale
hmmm
iam
guessing
its
not
but
hey
who
knows
it
had
a
decent
pour
light
gold
with
a
12
finger
white
head
that
was
gone
rather
quickly
but
left
a
mass
on
toplight
skunkiness
from
the
damn
green
bottle
and
some
toasted
grain
no
trace
of
hops
though
to
be
found
the
beer
tastes
mass
produced
somewhat
cooked
and
vegetallike
goes
down
a
little
harsh
made
me
wince
a
little
going
down
eh
wont
get
it
again
even
if
free
but
its
an
old
brand
glad
i
can
say
i
tried
it
anyways
pours

decent

moderate

but
poor

there
is
certainly
some
skunkiness
in
the
nose
but
it
is
accompanied
by
authentic
saaz
aromas
as
well
mild
vegetal
notes
in
the
background
pale

corny
sweet
at
first
sip
aftertaste
is
dry

presents
some
noble

not
overly
crisp

but
this
helps
it
attain
its
high
drinkablity
finishes
mostly
clean
with
a
bit
of
lightstruck
flavor
nicley
balanced
with
a
good
use
of
hops
an
unimpressive
yet
nonoffending
brew
the
green
bottle
skunk
hit
me
when
the
lid
came
off
i
almost
said
forget
it
right
then
and
there
but
i
persisted
once
the
skunk
wore
off
because
after
all
it
is
kind
of
refreshing
and
it
cost
2
75
for
a
sixer
surprisingly
low
carbination
medium
gold
color
one
finger
head
with
some
retention
just
enough
ale
fruitiness
to
stave
off
excessive
adjunt
smell
and
flavor
this
really
takes
me
back
sitting
beside
my
dad
and
uncle
at
a
local
tavern
and
absorbing
that
old
time
beer
flavoraroma
i
heard
this
is
hopped
with
cascade
and
i
do
get
some
floral
elements
but
i
mostly
get
earthygrassy
smell
and
flavor
some
sweeter
malts
though
the
middle
but
good
bitter
finish
mouthfeel
is
substantial
for
a
macro
produced
beer
of
any
kind
i
drank
this
camping
last
weekend
and
at
15
00
a
case
i
will
drink
more
this
summer
if
i
can
get
a
hold
of
some
the
one
to
turn
to
when
on
a
budget
thought
it
was
pretty
good
when
i
thought
it
was
a
pilsner
now
that
i
have
learned
its
a
pale
ale
i
changed
my
mind
a
bit
has
a
nice
blend
of
pilsner
tasting
malts
with
a
lightly
grainy
body
which
is
allowed
in
a
pils
the
hops
add
an
earthy
spicy
character
after
the
skunky
hop
aroma
subsides
the
body
never
really
reaches
medium
or
full
proportions
the
hops
never
reach
citrus
levels
although
there
is
a
light
green
apple
light
lime
flavor
the
malts
are
not
really
caramelized
or
mildly
toasty
anyhow
im
going
to
pretend
its
an
averagely
brewed
pilsner
its
simplistic
but
its
still
flavorful
and
sometimes
simplicity
is
grand
ps
i
too
am
financially
embarrassed
and
find
myself
searching
for
good
cheap
beer
im
brewing
at
home
but
ballantine
costs
half
what
dogfishhead
is
getting
just
sayin
feeling
nostalgic
i
went
for
some
ballantine
the
smell
was
yeasty
and
surprisingly
hoppy
the
color
of
the
beer
is
nothing
special
but
more
of
a
deeper
gold
than
the
other
cheap
beers
the
taste
is
suprising
its
good
very
good
in
fact
it
tastes
of
hops
and
is
clean
and
smooth
nicely
carbonated
mouthfeel
with
superb
drinkabilty
its
clean
and
smooth
and
feels
more
substanial
than
other
cheap
beers
i
like
it
alot
in
fact
i
think
this
is
one
of
the
best
economy
beers
around
i
wish
it
was
more
readily
avilable
nicely
carbonated
mouthfeel
type
of
beer
you
would
want
to
drink
if
you
had
to
all
day
at
a
friends
cook
out
but
otherwise
id
stray
toward
a
pale
ale
or
ipa
pours
a
nice
clear
light
gold
with
an
ample
head
and
some
lacing
good
carbonation
aroma
is
mainly
grainy
with
a
hint
of
grassiness
not
too
bad
taste
is
once
again
grainy
but
with
a
nice
smoothness
and
a
hint
of
bitterness
in
the
finish
mouthfeel
is
medium
with
a
slight
chewiness
that
i
was
not
expecting
very
easy
on
the
drinkability
scale
most
notably
its
smooth
quality
i
cant
imagine
this
beer
offending
anyones
pallete
yet
by
the
same
token
it
wont
light
your
world
on
fire
it
sure
as
hell
beats
bud
though
this
is
what
an
american
macrobrew
lager
should
really
taste
like
clean
with
an
honest
good
level
of
bitterness
and
good
taste
combined
with
very
easy
on
the
senses
intensity
the
ultimate
lawnmower
beer
i
think
this
is
what
budweiser
should
try
to
taste
like
the
mouthfeel
is
a
bit
overcarbonated
finishes
clean
enough
though
id
like
to
say
that
these
are
very
drinkable
but
the
offsmell
throws
me
a
bit
ballantine
xxx
ale
pours
with
a
brilliant
white
head
that
drops
leaving
a
bit
of
lace
and
a
thin
layer
of
foam
the
aroma
is
certainly
nothing
to
write
home
about
with
a
little
whiff
of
canned
corn
and
just
a
hint
of
hop
spice
light
in
body
and
in
flavor
ballantine
shows
off
a
little
bit
of
grassy
hops
under
a
blanket
of
sweet
malt
and
corn
the
hop
bitterness
is
just
enough
to
prevent
this
beer
from
being
too
sweet
wellcarbonated
yet
smooth
ballantines
is
very
drinkable
and
remains
a
bit
of
a
classic
its
easy
drinking
and
does
manage
to
encourage
me
to
have
another
one
but
overall
eh
aroma
is
very
light
grainy
slight
hops
in
the
aroma
but
no
citrusy
notes
detected
first
thing
that
hit
me
when
tasting
it
was
the
sweetness
of
the
malt
but
it
fades
quickly
to
a
dry
finish
i
couldnt
detect
much
of
a
hop
presence
even
though
it
says
its
an
ale
it
definitely
tastes
more
like
a
lager
to
me
it
lacks
the
crisp
dryness
that
some
of
the
other
macros
tend
to
have
i
would
have
preferred
a
12
oz
can
as
16
just
seems
to
be
just
enough
to
fatique
the
palate
with
this
beer
i
can
only
drink
one
of
these
and
would
have
to
move
on
to
something
else
i
dont
really
think
its
significantly
better
than
any
of
the
other
macro
competition
out
there
in
my
opinion
it
would
be
best
as
an
accompaniment
with
some
pizza
or
spicy
food
to
have
one
by
itself
for
the
sole
purpose
of
enjoying
a
brew
it
doesnt
really
cut
it
ballantine
is
an
american
classic
even
if
they
changed
the
recipe
im
not
sure
if
ive
ever
poured
it
into
a
glass
if
you
can
get
this
and
havent
tried
it
you
should
this
is
one
of
few
true
macros
out
there
with
any
significant
hop
content
even
if
it
is
a
weird
sour
brew
i
enjoy
it
about
once
a
week
now
that
i
live
in
brooklyn
economical
at
2
even
for
40
cold
ounces
ive
only
tried
this
stuff
once
before
and
didnt
really
remember
what
it
was
like
this
was
at
my
local
hannaford
so
why
not
this
is
the
most
pale
of
any
pale
ale
i
have
seen
barely
yellow
fuzzy
white
head
that
lasts
forever
taste
well
it
actually
has
some
pleasent
hoppy
flavor
not
sure
what
kind
that
does
fade
out
pretty
quick
mouthfeel
is
quite
thin
overall
this
beer
has
very
nice
flavor
and
can
be
made
into
a
real
nice
beer
regardless
of
any
kind
of
macro
status
if
i
were
offered
another
i
would
take
it
purchased
as
a
40
ounce
green
bottle
with
suggested
retail
price
of
1
25
marked
on
it
poured
a
light
golden
color
with
modest
white
puffy
head
smell
is
very
minimal
with
only
a
hint
of
sweetness
to
be
found
taste
is
also
very
mild
but
not
unpleasant
finished
wet
and
thirst
quenching
good
lawnmower
beer
walking
the
line
of
mediocrity
this
is
a
drinkable
brew
but
beyond
that
its
not
much
pours
out
to
a
medium
golden
color
with
a
fuller
1
inch
head
of
foam
and
some
lacing
aroma
is
fresh
and
laden
with
hops
and
grain
taste
is
a
letdown
very
mild
and
reminiscent
of
bud
light
flavors
of
watery
hops
and
bland
malts
are
hidden
in
the
background
but
a
stale
character
fills
the
palate
mostly
mouthfeel
is
weak
very
light
and
uninspiring
fair
drinkability
this
is
probably
best
when
you
are
dead
ass
tired
at
the
end
of
a
long
summer
day
of
working
in
the
yard
next
time
that
happends
to
me
ill
come
back
to
this
beer
maybe
this
beer
was
not
worth
the
15
bucks
i
paid
for
the
case
the
pour
was
an
off
yellow
color
with
a
thin
head
that
dissipated
quickly
the
smell
was
a
mixture
of
adjunct
ingredients
rice
i
believe
pun
gent
hops
and
pale
malts
the
taste
was
very
reflective
of
the
smell
and
provided
no
complexity
and
a
poor
aftertaste
the
mouthfeel
was
watery
as
in
most
macrolagers
and
the
off
flavor
made
this
beer
low
on
the
drinkability
scale
i
tried
this
beer
since
it
has
been
around
for
so
long
but
it
was
not
worth
the
investment
xxx
pours
with
a
whipped
white
foamy
head
that
lasts
several
minutes
the
brew
is
champagne
gold
and
has
generous
carbonation
hops
are
quite
noticeable
on
the
nose
surprisingly
the
most
abundant
aromatic
of
the
beer
the
taste
is
one
of
sweet
malt
perhaps
a
tad
too
sweet
as
this
distracts
from
the
drinkability
which
is
still
quite
pleasant
as
the
brew
hits
the
mouth
the
sweetness
is
easily
detected
then
fortunately
dries
quickly
perhaps
the
quintessential
ol
time
american
ale
reducing
the
residual
sugars
would
add
dramatically
to
the
potential
for
long
term
multiserving
quaffing
of
this
decent
american
mucho
macro
this
is
my
cheapass
indulgence
beer
plain
and
simple
its
a
cheap
fruity
ale
and
it
tastes
better
than
most
macro
lagers
at
a
lower
price
the
can
means
it
comes
with
me
to
the
beach
to
sit
and
fish
cannot
beat
that
combo
imho
lose
the
skunky
green
bottles
cans
keep
it
fresher

mouthfeeldrinkability
slightly
harsh
in
the
mouth
with
the
bold

yet
the
activity
cleanses
the
palate
to
make

round
of
fare
you
are

beer
has
a
good
creamy
white

and
some

there
is
some
light
floral
hops
in
the
aroma
but
they
were
overpowered
by
a
bit
of
skunk
character
the
taste
and
the
mouthfeel
were
both
a
little
light
with
a
bit
of
spicey
hops
comming
thru
on

mouthfeel
was
about
to

nope
not

wow
what
a
surprise
had
a
few
of
these
lurking
in
the
fridge
that
my
father
brought
i
figured
itd
be
interesting
to
try
a
beer
from
back
in
the
day
this
did
not
disappoint
i
feel
as
though
this
beer
is
a
time
capsule
through
all
the
years
it
has
not
given
way
to
becoming
another
generic
miller
product
with
an
old
nostalgic
name
the
recipe
supposedly
dates
back
to
1820
pours
a
golden
yellow
with
a
little
head
and
some
nice
bubbling
smell
is
slightly
hoppy
and
crisp
taste
is
wonderfully
crisp
and
hoppy
yes
there
are
hops
in
a
beer
that
cost
3
99
a
sixer
i
know
i
was
as
surprised
as
you
this
would
be
a
great
beer
for
a
hot
summer
day
or
to
buy
for
when
you
gotta
supply
a
large
amount
of
beer
for
the
guys
its
main
thrust
would
be
it
has
a
somewhat
unique
flavor
profile
when
compared
to
other
macro
styles

faint
bitterness
the
beer
is

one

pretty

strong
full

with
no
objectionable
qualities
fairly
cheap
strong
enough
and
easy
to
put
down
love
the
dry
hopped
flavor
this
beer
has
a
certain
dignity
to
it
that
the
regular
firemans
four
just
barely
misses
dont
get
me
wrong
firemans
four
is
a
great
beer
but
four
squared
is
just
that
four
squared
rich
thick
with
good
carbonation
and
a
universally
good
flavor
i
could
honestly
not
see
anybody
who
likes
beer
having
a
problem
with
this
brew
its
not
toomuch
or
toolittle
of
anything
it
tastes
great
without
venturing
into
the
more
adventurous
flavors
which
noncraftfans
may
not
enjoy
for
those
new
to
real
ale
who
prefer
more
standard
beers
i
would
start
here
if
youre
feeling
adventurous
or
want
something
thats
stronger
than
necessary
and
has
a
crazy
flavor
try
their
devils
backbone
either
way
this
is
a
company
that
makes
great
product
and
youre
in
good
hands
buying
any
of
their
beers
this
pours
from
the
can
a
solid
yellow
tan
color
like
a
dark
lemon
jello
color
theres
a
underprounced
strawgrass
hop
aroma
on
it
which
lends
itself
to
a
crisp
strawgrassy
characteristic
as
its
sipped
the
seasons
havent
changed
to
fall
where
i
live
yet
but
this
beer
is
making
me
think
it
would
be
the
perfect
autumn
ipa
sipper
over
all
a
really
surprisingly
good
beer
that
is
well
balanced
hoppy
beer
let
me
first
start
by
saying
im
a
big
fan
of
both
real
ale
and
firemans
4
but
this
rendition
of
the
beer
is
not
to
my
liking
the
beer
is
a
bright
golden
color
with
a
soap
bubble
head
nose
is
extremely
floral
and
citrusy
beer
is
a
sharp
one
hit
of
bitterness
and
overpowering
yeasty
flavors
that
left
an
unpleasant
after
taste
the
body
is
light
and
crisp
almost
no
malt
flavoring
to
balance
not
something
id
recommend
or
return
to
firemans
4
just
isnt
a
big
enough
beer
to
balance
the
dry
hoppying
when
i
first
tasted
this
i
thought
it
was
a
pale
ale
i
was
shocked
to
see
its
supposed
to
be
a
blonde
i
would
definitely
have
this
again
in
a
heartbeat
cheers
nice
summer
night
and
my
neighbor
brings
over
a
couple
of
texan
beers
this
one
in
a
can
surprised
me
because
it
started
as
a
blonde
ale
and
im
a
very
hoppy
beer
lover
it
was
very
clean
and
dry
and
although
not
really
hopped
up
it
was
very
pleasant
to
drink
balances
and
tasty
reat
nose
sweet
citrus
cotton
candy
definite
pine
much
more
on
the
malty
flavor
somewhat
surprising
nice
caramel
mild
breadiness
with
a
twinge
of
tartness
near
the
finish
very
nice
hops
that
finishes
a
pretty
solid
beer
i
dont
really
like
their
firemans4
offering
and
was
afraid
this
would
be
a
mildly
hopped
version
of
that
it
actually
is
a
very
nice
beer
that
really
showcases
the
hops
around
a
decent
base
beer
o
i
will
buy
this
all
the
time
overall
a
very
nice
beer
o
an
enjoyable
recommendable
beer
12
ounce
can
poured
into
glass
a
nice
clouded
golden
yellow
with
good
head
smell
of
hops
very
prounounced
a
little
citrus
fruity
smell
i
dont
like
blonde
beers
normally
and
i
dont
care
for
the
regular
firemans
4
version
but
this
hopped
up
version
is
awesome
hope
they
decide
to
make
it
a
regular
offering
this
and
their
stellar
lost
gold
ipa
are
my
favorites
from
real
ale
the
rye
pale
ale
aint
bad
either
its
an
excellent
beer
a
supercharged
version
of
the
firemans
4
with
a
clean
dry
finish
that
went
down
smooth
the
4squared
poured
a
hazy
gold
with
a
substantial
white
head
the
added
hops
were
readily
apparent
on
the
aroma
and
through
the
first
sips
that
really
transformed
the
firemens
4
into
a
fantastic
beer
the
base
firemans
4
flavors
are
there
with
a
bit
more
body
behind
them
and
more
pleasingly
bitter
hops
all
around
this
real
ale
beer
is
a
tasty
one
and
the
hops
help
make
it
and
enjoyable
brew
it
seems
like
it
would
go
very
well
with
certain
cheeses
and
its
fruity
component
makes
it
a
good
refresher
for
a
summer
day
something
i
wouldnt
normally
say
for
a
hoppier
than
average
beer
but
this
one
is
definitely
one
to
try
and
enjoy
and
i
recommend
grabbing
a
six
pack
or
two
if
you
can
find
it
this
revved
up
golden
ale
features
nice
floral
spice
on
the
nose
that
matches
the
wonderful
taste
of
aggressive
yet
not
offensive
hopping
plus
increased
carbonationcompared
to
firemans
4
the
beer
is
now
a
seasonal
offering
overall
id
really
love
to
try
this
from
the
tap
i
think
it
would
have
much
more
character
than
from
the
can
this
is
a
medium
bodied
brew
with
a
modest
amount
of
carbonation
it
is
quite
enjoyable
with
a
mellow
yeastiness
and
alcohol
feel
probably
the
best
real
ale
offering
i
have
tried
to
date
thanks
again
will
excellent
lightdrinking
but
still
hoppy
and
wonderfully
aromatic
beer
perfect
for
the
dog
days
of
summer
the
abv
on
this
is
6
per
real
ales
website
i
agree
with
other
reviewers
that
this
is
more
of
a
pale
ale
rather
than
an
amber
or
red
i
had
the
one
that
comes
in
a
black
can
perhaps
the
various
incarnations
of
4
have
created
confusion

good
happy
i
tried
would
not
seek
again
but
ive
seen
it
in
spots
where
if
i
had
to
make
choiceit
would
be
my
buy
o
pretty
good
nothing
special
but
it
gets
the
job
done
good
with
pizza
not
heavy
which
is
nice
i
do
not
write
reviews
pretty
fucking
good
ill
drink
it
again
thats
basically
how
every
review
should
be
good
beer
but
not
great
a
great
one
pretty
good
blonde
ale
very
refreshing
eh
not
bad
eh

pours
an
almost
clear
opaque

moderately

dry
overall
a
mediocre
effort
crisp
and
refreshing
nothing
offensive
overall
this
essentially
seems
like
a
tastier
adjunct
beer
option
and
it
serves
its
purpose
well
i
would
definitely
get
this
as
a
substitute
for
bmc
when
out
drinking
however
day
to
day
this
isnt
worth
putting
in
the
rotation
especially
with
better
beers
within
the
style
available
79100
i
wouldnt
seek
this
out
although
if
at
a
texas
night
spot
that
serves
only
bud
coors
corona
fare
and
this
one
happens
to
be
in
the
mix
still
best
to
order
this
o
overall
light
and
inoffensive
as
youd
expect
i
do
believe
it
is
an
ale
but
it
is
very
reminiscent
of
an
american
light
lager
with
just
a
bit
more
body
and
taste
than
that
highly
carbonated
thin
bodied
a
step
up
from
the
macros
but
little
else
raw
grain
lightly
sour
and
whiff
of
hop
essence
best
describes
this
beer
refreshing
on
a
hot
day
but
little
else
in
terms
of
redemption
on
draft
this
beer
is
smooth
and
creamy
with
a
citrus
apricot
flavor
on
the
finish
that
is
the
perfect
antidote
to
all
the
watered
down
domestic
varieties
available
from
a
bottle
the
firemans
4
doesnt
have
the
creaminess
of
the
draft
version
but
is
just
as
tasty
i
had
this
firemans
4
on
a
late
afternoon
and
it
was
just
what
i
needed
to
tame
the
heat
while
some
pilsners
can
be
light
and
bright
i
found
this
blonde
to
be
bigger
and
bolder
the
firemans
4
is
surprisingly
deep
and
full
on
the
palate

endind
is
slightly
dry
overall
a
nice
refreshing
session
brew
overall
i
like
it
this
might
be
a
good
gateway
beer
only
in
that
its
made
by
a
company
that
also
makes
some
great
pale
ales
a
decent
brown
ale
a
nice
tripel
and
other
decent
stuff
get
somebody
on
this
one
and
maybe
theyd
branch
out
to
other
real
ale
products
but
the
beer
itself
is
only
better
than
or
different
from
the
average
bmc
offering
by
a
fraction
overall
easy
to
drink
and
thirst
quenching
but
not
spectacular
the
flavors
are
a
little
on
the
light
side
ridiculously
easy
to
drink
with
nice
mild
characteristics
goes
well
with
texmex
overall
really
enjoyed
this
beer
very
refreshing
would
be
a
perfect
summer
beer
would
seek
this
beer
out
again
when
looking
for
a
blonde
with
a
hardy
grass
and
wheat
malt
simple
but
well
balanced
and
pleasing
this
is
relatively
light
bodied
with
a
very
crisp
feel
a
flavorful
choice
for
the
style
i
like
this
beer
it
was
cheep
and
tastes
good
more
success
from
rabc
o
this
is
a
great
summer
beer
and
comes
in
cans
so
is
great
for
camping
especially
in
the
texas
heat
o
solid
blonde
albeit
boring
overall
it
was
a
little
bitter
to
be
a
real
sessionable
ale
with
good
flavor
and
a
smooth
mouthfeel

any

products
but
if
this
is
an
example
of
what
they
have
to
offer
ill
be
on
the
lookout
for
more
of
their
stuff
this
was
a
very

ale
rjt
overall
not
bad
very
drinkable
and
a
definite

overall
flavors
are
a
bit
too
light
however
with
a
beer
like
this
any
real
off
flavors
would
most
likely
come
out
quickly
and
that
didnt
happen
so
thats
a
good
sign
i
am
mostly
a
dark
ale
drinker
but
this
one
surprised
me
i
had
the
real
ale
brewhouse
brown
ale
and
enjoyed
it
i
thought
i
would
give
this
a
shot
it
pours
light
with
a
a
small
head
very
common
for
blonds
the
smell
is
similar
to
a
lager
but
with
a
hint
of
hops
the
mouthfeel
and
taste
is
very
refreshing
with
a
hint
of
something
sweet
maybe
molasses
i
would
say
this
is
a
perfect
summer
blonde
ale
i
am
interested
to
see
what
it
would
taste
like
in
a
beer
batter
or
on
a
steak
o
firemans
is
a
wellcrafted
beer
but
its
flavor
lingers
which
is
the
opposite
of
what
im
looking
for
in
an
american
blonde
ale
still
it
is
frequently
the
best
option
on
tap
and
i
will
continue
to
drink
it
very
light
amber
body
good
effervescence
floral
hops
a
bit
of
breadiness
in
the
nose
taste
mirrors
aromas
a
bit
on
the
sweet
side
pretty
good
mouthfeel
very
sessionable
one
of
the
easiest
drinking
beers
on
the
trip
would
like
to
try
the
tap
version
again
for
comparison
worth
a
try
i
close
my
eyes
and
i
am
back
in
the
uk
this
really
reminds
of
many
excellent
bitters
i
had
on
cask
in
the
uk
all
around
excellent
this
says
volumes
about
real
ale
as
a
brewery
and
hay
merchant
as
an
establishment
both
for
makingserving
this
properly
highly
recommend
on
cask
overall
impression
a
very
easy
drinking
blonde
but
didnt
have
the
characters
i
wish
were
present
more
hops
and
fruit
flavors
could
have
popped
up
more
for
me
still
enjoyed
as
my
first
brew
of
this
festival
o
decent
blonde
just
kind
of
a
bland
style
for
me
but
very
enjoyable
and
drinkable
o
just
another
good
beer
from
real
ale
this
is
just
so
easy
to
drink
and
has
a
very
nice
taste
the
one
thing
i
enjoy
thoroughly
about
it
is
its
nutty
character
it
has
a
grainy
and
lasting
mouthfeel
it
is
in
some
ways
similar
to
real
ales
octoberfest
when
it
comes
to
the
nose
i
love
hopping
back
and
forth
between
the
two
in
a
22
oz
mug
the
wofts
are
euphoric
the
warmer
they
get
the
better
the
stank
as
the
carbonation
dies
down
the
better
the
flavors
come
through
real
ale
is
underrated
for
sure
esp
if
your
a
steady
beer
drinker
i
like
it
recommend
it
and
will
drink
it
again
fyi
its
better
than
their
rye
pale
ale
if
your
staring
at
the
planogram
and
dont
know
which
one
to
roll
the
dice
on
peace
lkeys
pours
golden
and
slightly
cloudy
with
a
modest
head
with
minimal
lacing
aroma
of
citrus
floral
and
maybe
a
bit
of
yeast
flavor
is
similar
to
aroma
very
smooth
even
somewhat
creamy
with
mild
hop
aftertaste
nice
drinkable
blonde
ale
but
nothing
special
o
i
thoroughly
enjoyed
this
beer
it
had
a
great
flavor
and
a
nice
appearance
i
look
forward
to
drinking
some
more
its
beer
i
drank
it
end
of
post
o
not
something
that
i
would
go
out
of
my
way
to
have
again
but
not
something
that
i
couldnt
bring
myself
to
finish
either
i
guess
i
would
describe
it
as
too
average
there
is
a
nice
balance
in
the
beer
and
the
highlight
for
me
is
the
hints
of
critrus
this
is
a
summer
drink
and
will
help
help
during
a
long
day
outside
o
not
something
id
come
back
to
personally
my
boss
on
the
other
hand
liked
it
quite
a
bit
o
overall
a
very
drinkable
beer
could
drink
a
few
of
these
probably
best
with
some
bbq
on
a
hot
day
pretty
smooth
and
easydrinking
but
the
more
maltdominated
blondes
arent
my
favorite
id
consider
this
a
gateway
beer
for
people
who
arent
familiar
with
craft
beer
or
for
those
hooked
on
bmc
for
the
rest
of
us
its
an
excellent
example
of
a
quality
craft
beers
approach
and
the
difference
it
makes
id
pair
this
with
pizza
nachos
grilling
outside
andif
it
was
cannedtubing
down
the
guadalupe
at
least
until
beverages
are
officially
banned
on
the
river
as
far
as
blond
ales
go
its
a
winner
this
was
a
decent
beer
it
had
kind
of
a
sweet
honey
flavour
to
it
it
was
otherwise
fairly
bland
highly
drinkable
not
exciting
probably
not
worth
the
price
for
that
bracket
it
had
kind
of
a
sticky
mouthfeel
o
i
guess
if
its
a
light
summerlawn
mower
type
beer
youre
looking
for
this
works
not
my
thing
though
nice
sensation
on
mouth
balanced
m
it
was
crisp
and
enjoyable
and
the
only
reward
to
the
not
so
enjoyable
taste
no
where
near
my
favorite
craft
brew
but
it
is
very
consistent
would
be
a
good
starter
beer
for
someone
jumping
off
the
main
stream
wagon
not
bad
at
all
but
not
great
overall
it
was
a
little
bitter
to
be
a
real
sessionable
ale
nothing
really
standing
up
and
greabbing
you
about
this
one
overalli
bought
a
single
but
its
6
99
for
a
6pk
its
affordable
above
average
but
not
going
to
knock
your
socks
off
maybe
the
best
year
round
beer
from
real
alewhich
isnt
saying
much
a
clear
pale
yellow
with
a
thin
white
head
smells
of
lemon
and
a
hint
of
grain
taste
is
a
hint
of
sweetness
followed
by
a
tobacco
and
grassy
hop
middle
and
finish
very
similar
hop
profile
to
a
california
common
i
brewed
that
utilized
northern
brewer
hops
average
mouthfeel
and
carbonation
overall
a
decent
beer
refreshing
and
non
offensive
o
a
pretty
good
summertime
beer
not
my
favorite
but
one
i
would
by
again
at
its
price
point
overall
a
great
beer
for
the
summer
very
refreshing
and
at
a
great
price
one
i
go
back
to
quite
often
this
is
one
of
the
texas
beers
converting
bmc
drinkers
into
craft
drinkers
stuck
in
the
airport
of
austin
linger
than
i
would
like
to
mention
cant
beat
em
drink
the
local
beer
this
was
tasted
from
a
bottle
so
take
that
into
account
appearance
was
a
bottle
so
towed
the
lone
and
said
it
is
good
smell
is
pretty
malty
as
is
taste
but
a
nice
blonde
overall
good
earthy
notes
easy
drinker
and
good
blonde
in
general
overall
drinkability
enjoyable
beer
withs
ome
off
flavors
that
dont
do
much
to
diminish
the
overall
enjoyability
pale
apricot
colored
with
a
firm
beige
head
that
lingers
long
and
leaves
sheets
if
jagged
lace
up
the
sides
of
the
glass
no
aroma
even
flavor
of
breast
malt
slight
corn
and
grassy
notes
even
mouthfeel
full
and
creamy
tasty
beer
not
overly
complex
this
is
a
well
made
blonde
ale
perfect
for
inclusion
in
the
lawnmower
beer
category
its
nothing
special
but
sometimes
you
want
just
a
plain
ol
beer
to
ground
your
tastebuds
in
reality
and
this
would
definitely
fit
that
bill
from
a
trade
with
gawnphishin
thanks
drinkability
this
is
one
of
those
beers
you
can
drink
one
after
another
without
worrying
about
missing
out
on
the
flavors
startlingly
smooth
and
simple
the
body
is
light
and
slick
which
is
par
for
the
style
drinkability
is
aided
well
easy
to
consume
decent
enough
flavors
what
i
got
in
the
nose
didnt
carry
over
to
the
flavor
thankfully
theres
some
light
malts
buttered
bread
corn
rice
noted
light
bitterness
this
is
an
easydrinking
beer
if
there
ever
was
one
perfect
for
the
grillingseason
got
this
in
a
trade
with
depechemode1983
along
with
a
slew
of
other
real
ale
beers
this
was
the
first
one
i
tried
and
it
didnt
knock
my
socks
off
but
it
is
a
well
made
easy
going
ale
firemans

poured
a
transparent
golden
straw
color
with
a
good
bit
of
carbonation
running
through
it
the
1
finger
white
head
stuck
around
for
a
short
while
then
receded
to
a
film
the
smell
is
of
grains
and
a
little
bit
of
hops
taste
is
similar
you
get
the
grain
in
the
front
and
it
finishes
with
the
hops
mouthfeel
is
a
little
thin
and
bubbly
for
what
i
prefer
in
a
goldenblonde
ale
drinkability
is
good
if
you
want
to
give
something
of
much
greater
quality
than
their
usual
to
your
bmc
friends
this
is
a
good
first
step
also
i
think
i
honestly
would
have
enjoyed
this
beer
more
in
texas
because
a
rainy
oregon
winter
doesnt
bring
out
the
better
qualities
of
this
beer
d
extremely
drinkable
this
is
a
good
beer
to
have
while
cooking

a
hot
day

pours
a

color
with
a
tiny
bit
of
a
white
head
and
not
much
else
the
aroma
doesnt
bring
much
forward
just
some
light
grain
and
a
bit
of
yeast
taste
is
mild
grain
flavors
without
any
real
yeast
or
any
other
characteristic
really
clean
i
guess
thats
about
the
only
compliment
i
have
here
goes
down
smoothly
as
well
i
suppose
this
was
a
competent
enjoyable
blonde
whose
only
real
weakness
was
its
appearance
which
isnt
really
all
that
important
after
all
flavor
is
a
blend
of
light
sweet
malts
with
a
slight
toast
grain
edge
and
a
pleasant
hop
bitterness
in
the
finish
aroma
is
simple
and
inoffensive
grassy
and
pale

blend
mouthfeel
is
thicker
and
fuller
than
your
average
macro
swill
with
a
robust
body
and
lingering
earthy
and
grassy
finish
appearance
is
a
pale
unfiltered
golden
cloud
with
minimal
head
produced
by
a
vigorous
pour
an
average
enjoyable
blonde
thanks
to
whoever
sent
me
this
this
is
a
great
sessionable
beer
very
refreshing
the
beer
pours
a
hazy
straw
yellow
color
with
a
white
head
the
aroma
is
wheat
lemons
and
grassy
hops
the
flavor
is
lemons
wheat
grass
and
biscuit
malt
medium
mouthfeel
and
medium
carbonation
very
drinkable
not
too
exciting
but
there
is
nothing
wrong
with
the
beer
d
goes
down
easy
no
flaws
to
speak
of
it
was
not
full
flavored
enough
to
keep
me
going
back
i
would
drink
this
at
a
bar
while
in
tx
if
it
were
on
special
i
paid
4
75
for
a
pint
and
it
was
not
worth
it
if
real
ale
was
going
for
something
that
light
beer
drinkers
could
handle
then
they
succeeded
to
me
this
beer
seemed
to
go
for
mass
appeal
and
i
would
recommend
this
as
a
much
better
alternative
to
people
use
to
the
adjunct
lager
scene
i
dont
disagree
with
the
bandaid
smell
comment
from
another
reviewer
i
would
say
that
the
taste
was
very
thin
i
want
to
the
rhe
ila
right
after
and
i
think
that
this
beer
made
that
beer
taste
better
and
unerring
rated
quality
i
might
add
this
beer
is
fine
foe
a
hot
summer
day
but
more
than
two
in
a
session
would
get
on
my
nerves
dnot
a
good
beer
maybe
infected
but
problems
all
over
medicinal
and
under
carbonated
drinkability
the
low
abv
and
great
mouth
feel
make
this
an
incredibly
easy
beer
to
drink
the
nose
and
palate
seem
right
in
line
with
the
style
although
its
not
my
favorite
yeah
as
noted
before
the
taste
is
remarkably
stronger
than
the
aroma
biscuity
and
slightly
hopped
even
definitely
pretty
good
and
very
drinkable
solid
blond
ale
glad
i
got
to
try
it
again
overall
i
thought
this
was
a
decent
beer
however
the
flavors
werent
robust
enough
to
be
anything
more
than
that
flavor
matches
the
aroma
well
with
a
bit
more
hoppinessfruitiness
on
the
front
of
the
tongue
malts
are
slightly
grainy
and
taste
of
bleached
bread
dough
and
wheat
a
slightly
hoppy
aftertaste
fits
the
style
well
but
it
was
the
clean
profile
of
this
brew
that
really
impressed
me
as
it
washed
down
the
hot
wings
well
body
is
light
and
nicelycarbonated
overall
a
tasty
brew
by
real
ale
not
quite
up
to
southern
stars
blonde
bombshell
but
its
a
distant
second
id
easily
have
this
again
but
probably
only
ontap
and
probably
only
when
the
other
options
are
all
macros
as
was
the
case
today
its
a
light
bodied
beer
with
a
low
bitterness
in
the
aftertaste
this
is
a
great
beer
and
i
was
able
to
drink
4
in
one
sitting
so
this
serves
for
a
good
drinkability
admittedly
this
one
of
my
favorite
beers
so
my
review
is
biased
pours
with
a
lighten
golden
color
minimal
head
transparent
body
has
a
smell
of
malts
with
traces
of
citrusy
fruits
taste
is
very
smooth
with
a
high
amount
of
carbonation
along
with
the
fruits
very
easy
beer
to
drink
has
a
light
beginning
and
ends
with
a
crisp
bite
not
overpowering
and
a
wonder
to
drink
had
from
a
bottle
from
grocery
store
pore
clear
gold
excellent
carbonation
exactly
how
the
style
should
look
aroma
is
malty
sweet
no
noticable
hop
aroma
a
great
beer
from
a
day
on
the
patio
if
it
were
available
in
cans
would
be
my
goto
lakebeachriver
beer
accessable
to
beer
drinkers
of
all
types
this
is
what
i
give
my
friends
when
only
craft
beer
is
available
and
they
are
bmc
drinkers
once
more
a
thin

head
that
dissipated
into
wisps
even
prior
to
arrival
color
was
lemonyellow
with
nequality
clarity
nose
had
a
grainy
silagelike
scent
interesting
mouthfeel
was
thintomedium
with
a
slight
peppery
taste
on
the
tongue
finish
was
dry
and
refreshing
good
mouthfeel
nice
carbonation
overall
very
drinkable
and
a
great
beer
for
the
people
who
dont
like
strongerdarker
beer
d
could
be
an
easy
summer
cook
out
session
beer
d
i
had
two
glasses
and
enjoyed
them
both
this
seems
like
a
good
fallback
beer
if
im
playing
pool
which
i
was
and
there
wasnt
anything
great
on
tap
which
there
wasnt
a
very
smooth
drink
and
something
i
would
enjoy
at
a
bar
definitely
a
beer
to
suggest
to
first
time
beer
drinkers
and
a
beer
to
take
to
gatherings
poured
into
an
imperial
pint
glass
formed
a
12
bright
white
head
over
the
clear
light
golden
brew
airy
head
collapses
at
reasonably
quick
pace
with
minimal
lace
aroma
is
sweet
pale
and
prominent
vegetal
taste
is
dominantly
pale
malt
sweetness
with
the
earthy
hops
towards
the
end
mouthfeel
is
pretty
smooth
and
drinkability
is
okay
as
well
this
one
could
be
better
d
if
you
are
looking
for
a
beer
that
you
can
pound
this
will
do
nicely
there
is
nothing
that
sets
this
apart
from
the
blonde
crowd
though
golden
clear
head
dissapates
quickly
medium
carbonation
this
is
my
1st
blonde
ale
so
i
have
no
others
to
compare
it
to
it
reminds
me
of
a
witbier
which
is
not
my
favorite
a
little
too
much
fruit
finishes
clean
and
is
easy
to
drink
malty
with
only
the
slightest
hint
of
hops
a
sessionable
beer
but
not
one
with
a
lot
of
complexity
not
bad
at
all
for
a
blonde
decent
balance
and
a
softer
body
on
this
made
for
a
refreshing
quaff
good
summertime
beer
tastes
more
complex
than
it
smells
more
like
a
kolsch
than
a
blonde
peat
and
mineral
nodes
pleasantly
accentuate
very
pale
malt
light
dry
hops
finish
things
out
pours
a
clear
golden
color
with
a
thin
head
leaves
some
lacing
smells
faintly
of
banana
and
noble
hops
you
can
taste
the
banana
as
well
its
has
medium
carbonation
and
a
creamy
but
clean
finish
theres
some
hop
bitterness
there
as
well
which
serves
to
clean
the
whole
thing
up
a
bit
the
finish
is
slightly
dry
which
contributes
to
the
overall
drinkability
of
the
beer
ive
had
this
on
bottle
before
and
didnt
like
it
as
much
on
draft
you
can
taste
a
lot
more
its
one
of
the
most
sessionable
beers
ive
had
in
texas
a
honey
yellow
pour
with
an
already
faded
head
leaving
a
good
bit
of
empty
space
in
the
pint
note
to
ginger
man
theres
a
spotty
lacing
all
around
smells
of
malts
a
bit
of
grass
and
some
faint
hops
tastes
of
sweet
malts
some
honey
and
subtle
almost
undiscernible
light
fruits
im
a
big
real
ale
fan
but
this
one
could
use
some
work
firemans
4
pours
into
the
glass
hazy
unfiltered
blonde
with
a
wisp
of
yeast
which
all
sits
underneath
a
frothy
white
cap
of
foam
simple
nose
of
grain
yeasty
fruit
and
little
to
no
hops
detected
flavor
is
a
bit
citruisy
than
the
nose
and
yields
a
nice
hop
finish
for
those
of
you
who
are
new
to
craft
beer
pick
this
up
when
you
see
it
nice
nice
balance
boil
some
crawfish
and
dont
forget
firemans
4
this
will
be
a
staple
in
my
fridge
all
spring
and
summer
everything
has
been
good
session
beers
so
far
do
not
recommend
this
one
again
d
drinkable
but
i
wont
be
having
again
easy
to
drink
but
smell
was
quite
off
pours
from
the
bottle
a
golden
yellow
with
a
full
two
fingers
of
white
head
bubbles
rise
from
the
bottom
of
the
glass
throughout
the
life
of
the
beer
smell
is
mostly
malty
with
some
citrus
and
pepper
to
make
things
a
bit
more
interesting
firemans
4
tastes
a
bit
bready
and
fruity
with
just
a
hint
of
hops
in
the
finish
on
the
whole
the
beer
is
crisp
and
light
and
a
nice
local
offering
to
enjoy
during
warm
weather
this
is
a
blonde
ale
you
cant
ask
too
much
more
from
the
style
pours
a
pale
straw
yellow
with
a
thin
white
head
that
sticks
around
as
a
nice
ring
and
provides
some
nice
lacing
smell
is
malty
and
earthy
with
a
little
fruit
the
taste
pale
malts
with
a
slight
hint
of
earthy
hops
there
isnt
much
going
on
with
this
one
its
not
too
thin
but
not
a
lot
of
body
the
drinkability
is
good
but
not
spectacular
i
would
like
a
little
more
flavor
and
body
fairly
drinkable
brew
i
like
it
this
is
my
second
real
ale
brew
and
ive
been
impressed
so
far
i
was
somewhat
surprised
by
the
fairly
low
reviews
for
this
one
on
here
but
i
like
it
pours
a
golden
clearish
colored
body
with
a
smallish
head
offwhitish
in
color
has
a
bitter
aroma
some
hops
a
medium
strength
aroma
a
weakish
bitter
malty
taste
but
balanced
somewhat
sweet
reminds
me
of
an
ipa
maybe
a
nice
beer
for
a
change
of
pace
from
my
usual
ipas
and
barleywines
this
beer
is
becoming
very
easy
to
find
in
texas
overall
i
wasnt
really
impressed
by
this
beer
i
had
heard
good
things
about
it
but
i
ended
up
being
disappointed
the
beer
is
very
light
bodied
and
has
a
small
bitterness
in
the
aftertaste
this
is
a
well
balanced
beer
that
would
go
good
with
almost
any
meal
dnotes
i
used
to
drink
this
beer
a
lot
more
on
tap
here
in
austin
but
for
some
reason
havent
done
so
as
much
recently
its
a
shame
as
this
is
actually
a
very
good
simple
brew
it
basically
tastes
like
a
full
bodied
macro
lager
that
used
ale
fermentation
to
give
it
the
distinctive
esters
you
dont
get
wa
cold
bottom
fermented
lager
this
would
be
a
great
brew
to
give
to
a
macro
only
drinker
to
introduce
them
to
the
world
of
craft
beer
it
also
has
enough
character
to
give
to
an
experienced
beer
lover
if
they
desire
a
simple
refreshing
ale
drinkability
overall
a
good
session
beer
i
have
been
known
to
drink
my
share
of
firemans
on
hot
summer
days
its
watery
and
light
bodied
summation
would
be
not
great
but
not
bad
either
single
from
mhewes
in
preseason
football
bif
notched
as
best
by
december
this
is
a
solid
session
beer
imo
not
much
in
the
way
of
taste
but
good
none
the
less
the
taste
isnt
all
that
impressive
its
just
a
little
too
generic
for
this
style
but
its
not
a
bad
taste
overall
this
is
a
very
good
drinkable
beer
but
dont
expect
anything
to
knock
your
socks
off
apparence
was
pretty
good
with
a
light
pale
gold
colour
with
virtually
no
head
retention
and
no
lacing
scent
and
taste
was
weak
with
some
really
odd
flavours
that
i
could
not
quite
place
i
finished
the
beer
however
not
one
that
i
would
purchase
on
my
own
nice
and
light
flavor
that
seams
to
be
based
on
the
yeast
in
this
beer
smels
kind
of
sour
but
the
smell
lies
because
i
dont
taste
soure
in
this
one
at
all
i
dont
tast
any
hops
in
this
one
eather
this
is
a
nice
drinking
light
flavor
beer
that
i
would
drink
agan
for
sure
drinkability
for
this
one
is
low
in
my
view
ill
pour
this
beer
out
and
probably
wont
seek
this
one
out
again
brought
it
back
with
me
from
my
trip
to
texas
a
descent
mouthfeel
and
not
the
least
bit
heavy
heavy
on
my
palate
if
in
a
bind
and
this
was
on
a
list
i
would
drink
this
beer
over
just
about
anything
else
especially
in
a
macro
sense
nice
effort
for
a
go
to
beer
from
the
folks
in
blanco
d
i
could
drink
these
for
hours
but
would
pair
with
food
because
there
isnt
a
whole
lot
of
flavor
although
abv
is
not
listed
i
assume
it
is
between
45
drinkability
very
sessionable
and
a
great
summer
pick
thanks
to
bgthang
for
sending
me
a
few
of
these
put
to
good
use
in
some
august
heat
i
had
this
beer
with
a
7
on
the
menu
it
was
worth
the
money
and
anyone
who
goes
to
katzs
should
try
this
if
you
like
good
beer
you
will
not
be
disappointed
in
the
least
mouthfeel
is
carbonated
crisp
sweet
and
has
a
great
weight
very
nice
other
than
a
lack
of
head
formation
and
a
lackluster
nose
firemans
4
is
good
beer
since
the
final
three
attributes
are
far
more
important
to
me
than
the
first
two
the
overall
score
is
not
a
reflection
of
how
i
really
feel
about
this
real
ale
ale
id
drink
it
again
very
pale
yelloe
hazey
color
with
one
finger
tight
white
head
that
hung
in
there
pretty
well
smells
of
grainy
and
sweet
malts
some
grassy
and
spicey
hops
and
a
white
grapegreen
apple
sent
taste
is
bpretty
smooth
with
a
good
malt
flavor
with
more
hop
hit
than
advertised
in
the
nose
and
the
aftertaste
is
that
grapeapple
that
i
smelled
its
nice
on
the
mouth
if
light
and
has
a
good
dry
finish
certainly
sessionable
md
definitely
a
quaffer
if
ive
ever
had
one
carbonation
is
perfect
and
a
great
combination
with
spicy
dishes
drinkability
is
about
average
seems
sessionable
but
flavors
are
uninspiring
d
its
giving
me
heartburn
but
i
really
like
it
d
quite
easy
to
drink
great
for
when
the
sun
is
still
up
d
i
can
see
why
this
doesnt
get
better
reviews
it
seems
kinda
bland
boring
i
liked
the
subtleties
and
enjoyed
the
malty
fruity
flavor
and
aroma
a
good
version
of
this
kolschlike
style
easy
to
drink
relatively
light
body
and
fine
to
sip
on
a
springlike
day
poured
a
hazy
straw
with
a
big
white
head
that
disappeared
in
the
time
it
took
me
to
turn
back
around
no
lacing
aroma
is
really
weak
there
is
a
faint
malty
sweetness
but
absolutely
nothing
distinct
taste
is
much
the
same
there
is
nothing
great
but
nothing
memorable
either
mouthfeel
is
medium
bodied
and
slightly
dry
its
definitely
drinkable
had
a
whole
lot
worse
beers
then
this
one
as
crappy
as
my
review
is
i
still
very
much
appreciate
hopsleeroy
for
this
brew
thanks
lee
this
is
only
my
2nd
real
ale
bc
beer
now
on
to
the
sisyphus
a
solid
middle
of
the
road
brew
would
make
good
session
beer
or
an
outstanding
lawnmower
if
it
was
cheaper
overall
impression
very
basic
beer
but
for
a
blonde
its
pretty
good
the
drinkability
is
good
not
a
bad
beer
at
all
prosit
mk
d
easy
beer
was
fairly
clear
a
light
straw
color
with
a
small
thin
head
the
aroma
was
of
very
light
malt
with
no
hop
aroma
evident
taste
was
about
the
same
a
little
malt
slightly
grainy
with
not
much
else
evident
mouthfeel
was
thin
and
watery
overall
i
didnt
care
for
this
one
it
needed
more
of
some
type
of
character
malt
hops
something
prosit
draft
at
billys
in
austin
slightly
cloudy
yellow
color
similar
to
some
hefeweizens
light
smell
of
corn
malt
and
spices
similar
taste
with
a
little
hearty
corn
like
malt
taste
followed
by
some
light
corianderish
spice
mild
easy
drinking
beer
almost
like
a
light
hefeweizen
nothing
to
write
home
about
but
a
decent
simple
beer
as
for
drinkability
i
can
see
drinking
this
in
the
hot
summer
in
az
or
texas
where
it
is
made
as
a
lawnmower
beer
or
something
but
certainly
not
one
i
would
seek
out
again
cloudy
straw
color
with
minimal
head
the
nose
is
of
light
malts
and
subtle
banananess
initially
it
is
hop
forward
seems
like
a
saaztype
followed
by
a
malty
backbone
with
a
timid
amount
of
cloves
tastes
better
than
it
looks
there
is
some
substance
to
yet
it
is
very
light
and
refreshing
becomes
kind
of
bland
as
it
warms
so
drink
quickly
special
thanks
to
ricksawyer
for
this
beer
d
not
very
tasty
goes
down
ok
not
very
filling
not
the
best
representation
of
style
mild
kick
not
much
left
to
say
other
than
i
would
not
recommend
this
beer
at
all
this
is
a
bit
to
mild
mannered
to
be
anything
but
the
gentlest
of
crossover
beers
ive
liked
everything
i
have
had
from
this
brewery
i
just
like
this
one
a
little
less
this
beer
doesnt
have
a
lot
going
on
but
is
pretty
easy
to
get
down
poured
from
a
12oz
bottle
with
no
dating
system
into
a
pint
glass
it
was
a
hazy
golden
color
with
some
yeast
bits
in
it
it
barely
had
a
head
and
that
quickly
dissipated
into
nothing
no
collar
foam
or
lacing
the
aroma
was
malty
and
sweet
very
reminiscent
of
a
kolsch
the
taste
was
average
to
slightly
above
average
for
me
this
style
doesnt
have
much
in
the
flavor
department
but
they
are
easy
to
put
down
and
make
good
session
beers
i
dont
see
this
being
a
big
player
in
the
rotation
but
does
make
a
nice
change
up
beer
in
the
summer
heat
overall
a
good
beer
for
the
style
and
worth
trying
3

rbchangeup
t
y
smell
is
very
malty
taste
is
malty
sweet
and
maybe
fruity
a
little
hop
bitterness
but
very
little
not
sure
what
this
beer
is
to
me
it
seems
almost
like
a
lager
but
lacking
poured
into
a
pint
glass
from
a
12oz
bottle
the
beer
pours
a
hazy
medium
straw
forming
a
very
thin
white
head
no
lacing
apparent
on
the
glass
the
aroma
is
a
light
mix
of
hops
and
fruit
aromas
along
with
a
little
grain
the
taste
has
a
more
noticeable
malt
character
mainly
sweet
and
finishing
with
a
hint
of
hop
citrus
flavor
nothing
too
complex
about
the
taste
medium
mouthfeel
being
a
little
thicker
than
expected
but
not
bad
light
flavor
and
assumed
low
abv
makes
this
a
very
drinkable
summer
ale
overall
not
as
bad
as
others
have
said
but
still
nothing
special
about
this
ale
to
set
it
apart
from
the
rest
in
the
end
just
a
typical
summer
ale
better
on
draftor
at
least
it
seemed
better
in
the
past
with
more
detectable
hoppiness
pours
a
crystal
clear
golden
with
a
full
head
with
a
variety
of
different
levels
of
elevation
and
some
raised
lacing
left
on
the
glass
the
aroma
of
the
malt
has
a
candyish
sweetness
that
reminds
me
of
cotton
candy
and
i
get
a
bit
of
citrus
hop
underneath
malt
flavor
is
light
crisp
toasted
and
with
some
graininess
herbal
hop
flavor
snappy
bitterness
and
an
overall
dryness
come
in
the
finish
mouthfeel
is
light
and
apropos
for
the
overall
refreshing
quality
of
this
beer
but
i
wouldve
liked
just
a
bit
more
carbonation
tasty
and
refreshing
but
i
can
think
of
other
beers
id
rather
have
d
tasty
with
an
aftertaste
that
starts
out
very
pleasant
and
degrades
slowly
to
a
dryness
that
begs
another
sip
sessionable
i
dont
know
how
to
style
this
beer
is
but
it
is
a
good
alternative
to
the
fake
beer
that
both
fake
beer
drinkers
and
real
beer
drinkers
can
both
agree
on
especially
on
tap
taste
is
spicy
upfront
nice
lemon
flavor
without
any
citric
acidity
big
deep
biscuity
malt
base
with
cracked
grain
piping
up
at
times
i
get
a
liitle
white
pepper
and
the
taste
then
darkens
slightly
to
something
im
associating
with
bay
leaf
for
the
finish
i
love
this
beer
but
feel
it
is
kinda
all
over
the
place
for
blonde
and
could
be
brighter
fortunately
im
not
feeling
like
a
style
nazi
mouthfeel
is
midbodied
and
grippy
step
up
from
a
macro
lager
unobtrusive
in
almost
every
way
except
that
graininess
but
thats
not
necessarily
a
good
thing
for
people
who
want
flavor
and
some
hops
maybe
and
not
just
an
easy
quaffer
d
fairly
underwhelming
the
taste
is
rather
light
and
goes
down
relatively
easy
there
are
some
slight
citrus
notes
with
a
mild
hop
finish
overall
it
reminds
me
of
a
watered
down
cross
between
a
wit
and
a
kellerbier
which
left
me
a
bit
dissapointed
overall
a
very
tasty
and
refreshing
brew
not
quite
what
i
expected
and
pleasantly
surprised
thanks
chadspivey
for
the
brew
on
tap
at
bd
rileys
on
6th
street
in
austin
it
had
a
golden
body
with
a
slight
haze
beneath
a
creamy
white
head
that
displayed
good
retention
and
fair
lacing
the
nose
was
fairly
basic
with
a
combination
of
lightly
grainy
malt
yeasty
fruitiness
and
floral
hops
it
was
mediumlight
bodied
and
crisp
the
flavor
followed
the
aroma
it
was
basic
but
very
nice
a
nicely
hoppy
not
overdone
beer
the
bitterness
was
kept
in
check
and
the
hops
were
quite
present
but
not
to
the
point
that
they
overshadowed
the
malt
nicely
done
very
drinkable
and
seemingly
quite
popular
throughout
the
bars
of
austin
this
is
one
of
my
favorites
from
real
ale
and
i
am
stoked
that
they
put
it
in
bottles
this
used
to
be
a
bar
only
treat
for
me
i
still
like
it
better
on
tap
but
now
i
am
not
limited
in
my
options
definitely
worth
a
try
light
and
creamy
understated
wheat
edge
and
body
powderychalky
feel
decent
hop
tartness
finishes
a
slight
dry
the
beer
was
a
slightly
hazy
straw
color
with
a
touch
of
white
head
it
laced
the
glass
nicely
smell
was
tart
like
wheat
malt
and
apricots
with
a
little
touch
of
hops
the
aftertaste
had
those
same
notes
though
the
main
flavor
was
clean
like
a
germanstyle
lager
enough
hop
presence
balanced
the
beers
sweetness
making
an
overall
wellrounded
brew
the
beers
body
was
the
appropriately
light
for
a
refreshing
summer
ale
i
would
have
this
one
again
next
time
im
in
austin
not
a
bad
brew
but
not
one
id
go
out
of
my
way
for
on
tap
at
the
flying
saucer
in
addison
it
is
a
distinctly
gold
not
yellow
color
with
a
thin
head
that
dissippated
quickly
the
smell
is
caramel
and
floral
hops
redundantly
repeating
myself
the
taste
is
surprisingly
malty
with
a
crisp
sharp
aftertaste
that
has
a
note
of
citrus
the
mouthfeel
is
silky
and
a
touch
creamy
definitely
not
the
macro
brew
it
looks
like
to
start
the
drinkability
is
excellent
it
is
very
refreshing
and
the
silkiness
balances
the
crisp
finish
nicely
this
one
has
session
beer
written
all
over
it
the
smell
is
floral
hoppy
and
fruity
the
mouthfeel
is
pretty
light
but
not
watery
overall
a
pretty
good
beer
it
poured
a
pale
yellow
color
with
a
lot
of
haziness
and
a
fairly
high
degree
of
very
fine
carbonation
aroma
was
a
slight
malt
sweetness
flavor
was
also
very
lightly
sweet
like
a
very
lightly
flavored
witbier
and
i
detected
some
cloviness
mouthfeel
was
also
very
light
and
thin
this
beer
struck
me
as
very
drinkable
although
its
lightness
was
slightly
offputting
to
me
while
i
liked
the
way
it
tasted
it
just
didnt
feel
like
beer
in
my
mouth
not
sure
if
that
makes
sense
overall
id
recommend
it
but
and
maybe
this
is
just
me
im
surprised
it
has
the
broad
appeal
it
does
in
austin
d
all
night
long
i
could
play
drinking
games
with
this
one
too
bad
they
dont
make
it
in
bottles
very
easy
to
drink
a
session
beer
if
i
have
ever
had
one
quite
nice
taste
as
well
somebody
ship
me
a
case
when
the
weather
starts
to
get
warm
and
i
will
give
it
a
real
test
drive
pours
a
clear
blonde
amber
color
with
a
short
white
head
that
fades
into
a
medium
lace
nose
is
somewhat
sweet
with
a
bit
of
floral
hops
and
hints
of
honeysuckle
taste
begins
with
sweet
honey
malt
and
a
light
fruitiness
followed
by
some
mildly
bitter
hops
to
round
things
out
not
a
bad
choice
as
a
session
beer
or
as
something
to
enjoy
on
a
warm
afternoon
opinion
i
really
like
this
beer
i
dont
know
how
much
it
walks
the
line
between
the
golden
ale
that
is
printed
on
the
bottle
versus
the
apa
that
it
is
classified
on
this
site
it
is
really
clean
and
refreshing
like
a
golden
ale
while
it
has
a
bit
of
a
hoppy
aroma
and
flavor
that
is
not
too
common
with
a
true
golden
ale
regardless
the
beer
is
really
clean
and
drinkable
and
that
is
why
i
would
definitely
drink
it
again
i
thought
it
was
intended
to
be
a
fruit
beer
based
on
the
flavor
in
the
pint
glass
it
looks
apaish
enough
light
gold
white
head
that
doesnt
spend
too
much
time
hanging
around
no
lace
and
lots
of
columns
of
carbonation
the
smell
has
an
odd
fruity
odor
like
canned
pineapples
or
apricots
the
flavor
matches
the
smell
and
i
couldnt
detect
or
was
too
distracted
to
notice
any
hoppiness
light
bodied
short
finish
definitely
not
a
hardy
winter
beer
this
would
make
a
nice
barbecuelawnmower
beverage
this
was
my
first
beer
from
real
ale
found
it
better
with
food
not
strong
enough
to
stand
by
itself
though
i
typially
really
like
apas
but
i
didnt
really
care
for
this
one
too
much
apparence
was
pretty
good
with
a
light
pale
gold
colour
with
virtually
no
head
retention
taste
was
weak
with
some
really
odd
flavours
i
finished
it
but
ive
definitely
had
better
from
real
ale
and
much
better
tasting
pale
ales
cut
out
for
a
session
ale
its
not
heavy
on
either
malt
or
hops
and
is
a
well
made
beer
thats
a
good
foundation
for
ras
product
line
this
is
the
4th
beer
ive
had
from
real
ale
and
my
least
favorite
appearance
is
golden
pale
with
small
head
smell
is
rather
weak
some
hops
mixed
with
fruit
after
reading
other
reviews
i
think
grapefruit
are
present
taste
is
of
mild
hops
and
grapefruit
not
exactly
what
i
like
but
not
bad
drinkability
is
pretty
good
but
this
beer
didnt
quite
feel
right
on
my
palate
maybe
i
just
dont
like
the
style
its
definently
not
like
any
other
apas
that
ive
had
overall
impression
a
light
refreshing
tasty
beer
pretty
straightforward
but
a
touch
of
intricacy
lends
itself
to
a
good
summer
thirst
quencher
or
session
beer
drinkabilitynotes
tasted
on
tap
at
the
brewery
during
the
realale
seventh
anniversary
celebration
in
blanco
tx
on
june
28th
2003
according
to
the
good
folks
at
realale
this
beer
may
be
offered
in
bottles
soon
alas
there
are
no
plans
to
offer
the
muchbeloved
coffee
porter
in
bottles
this
was
a
good
beer
much
lighter
than
i
normally
prefer
but
a
great
summertime
refreshing
beer
drink
one
on
a
hot
afternoon
and
see
if
you
agree
i
was
slightly
reminded
of
a
wheat
beer
with
its
effervescence
and
slightly
cloudy
appearance
very
crisp
with
a
hint
of
bitter
and
sweetness
reminds
me
of
a
pale
ale
but
a
little
lighter
my
first
experiences
with
real
ale
brewery
were
iffy
but
i
think
that
was
due
to
poor
retail
storage
this
year
ive
revisited
all
the
real
ale
brews
and
i
think
theyve
my
favorite
texas
micro
so
overall
would
i
recommend
it
of
course
if
you
see
that
the
price
is
the
same
as
a
budweiser
or
a
molson
or
a
coors
as
a
labatt
50
take
the
labatt
50
with
no
doubt
or
no
fear
this
is
a
nice
refreshing
testing
beer
with
that
personal
taste
i
took
one
and
i
was
surprised
that
i
took
a
second
one
o
disappointing
since
i
can
recall
this
beer
being
much
more
heavily
hopped
many
years
ago
i
wouldnt
turn
one
down
but
i
dont
see
myself
buying
this
again
as
there
are
better
choices
in
this
class
for
the
same
money
seems
like
another
standard
light
drink
o
more
of
an
adjunct
lots
of
bready
malts
and
quite
sweet
easy
drinking
but
not
something
i
would
grab
for
unless
no
other
options
were
available
a
simple
minded
brew
indeed
overall
i
was
quite
surprised
by
the
brew
while
not
a
flavor
powerhouse
it
was
much
smoother
then
i
would
have
expected
and
was
quite
easy
drinking
and
enjoyable
pours
a
clean
yellow
color
with
a
white
head
in
the
aroma
faint
nose
more
lager
tones
than
ale
in
the
taste
a
bit
sweet
and
still
lager
like
not
so
much
ale
like
a
small
bite
and
a
lighter
bodied
mouthfeel
with
a
small
dryness
of
a
standard
lager
more
a
lager
that
ale
however
fresh
nonetheless
great
beer
by
macro
standards
good
beer
by
any
standards
a
tasty
macro
worth
sucking
back
in
a
pinch
as
far
as
macro
beers
go
this
may
be
the
best
ive
ever
had
and
that
is
saying
a
lot
because
ive
had
plenty
this
is
a
c
pale
ale
and
not
a
standout
at
all
when
compared
within
that
beer
style
but
taken
as
a
macro
im
hardpressed
to
come
up
with
something
more
palatable
a
b
grade
seems
far
more
fair
in
that
context
but
im
not
much
of
a
curve
grader
i
sometimes
see
this
ontap
at
bars
with
minimal
selection
and
it
will
probably
be
my
default
option
at
these
places
in
the
future
overall
i
was
actually
surprised
at
how
decent
this
beer
was
growing
up
it
seemed
like
this
beer
was
the
lunch
line
for
a
lot
of
beer
jokes
for
the
style
its
actually
pretty
drinkable
and
has
a
decent
taste
you
could
do
far
worse
probably
30
years
since
may
last
fitty
not
sure
if
it
was
the
nostalgia
or
the
ale
but
i
enjoyed
it
on
tap
at
the
sheraton
toronto
wish
it
were
more
available
as
an
option
when
compelled
to
drink
a
mass
produced
product
or
chlorinated
tap
water
overall
a
surprise
macro
that
works
well
in
dire
situations
when
theres
no
other
choice
at
shows
this
doesnt
completely
suck
especially
for
a
rather
warm
summer
day
and
looking
for
a
thirst
quencher
thos
brew
pours
out
as
a
clear
yellow
color
with
a
fizzy
whit
sheaf
that
last
only
a
few
seconds
the
smell
of
the
beer
almost
has
a
pilsner
aroma
going
on
in
it
there
is
some
grassy
notes
and
some
hops
on
the
nose
the
taste
was
kinda
hoppy
and
earthy
the
mouthfeel
is
light
and
a
little
bitey
overall
not
really
that
much
of
an
impressive
brew
really
wouldnt
need
to
have
this
one
again
i
think
this
beer
is
definitely
an
above
average
macrobrew
its
cheap
has
no
really
bad
qualities
and
is
drinkable
i
might
keep
this
around
the
house
pours
a
golden
yellow
colour
with
thin
white
head
some
mild
lacing
on
the
glass
i
can
smell
a
hint
of
hops
with
bready
malts
no
off
flavours
just
some
mild
bitterness
pretty
much
this
used
to
be
one
of
my
favourites
before
i
knew
of
craft
beer
it
has
more
flavour
than
a
typical
macro
lager
one
of
my
favorite
beers
when
i
lived
in
london
on
this
is
refreshing
and
crisp
but
overall
mediocre
still
if
i
wouldnt
turn
it
down
on
tap
for
sentimentality
another
ale
from
the
big
boys
that
blurs
the
line
between
lager
and
ale
kim
mitchell
should
look
into
this
i
drank
most
of
this
before
being
distracted
by
watching
an
entertaining
amateur
play
so
it
turned
out
to
be
sufficient
for
the
lull
but
now
onto
something
more
modern
and
appropriate
for
the
venue
oh
right
big

finish
much
more
flavour

than

but
still
pretty
plain
and
tasteless
compared
to
most
craft
offerings
when
fresh
and
at
its
best
50
is
a
bright
serviceable
fallback
that
outshines
its
mainstream
counterparts
however
unless
youre
in
a
dingy
bar
theres
no
reason
to
buy
this
over
superior
micro
options
i
tried
this
beer
on
may
22
2009
at
hoops
bar
and
grill
bremner
blvd
in
toronto
ontario
canada
the
beer
poured
a
translucent
gold
colour
with
a
minimal
white
head
and
a
high
amount
of
effervescence
the
aroma
was
grainy
malt
and
a
surprising
amount
of
hops
the
mouthfeel
was
medium
bodied
with
medium
carbonation
the
flavour
was
similar
to
the
aroma
with
grainy
malt
and
a
surprising
hoppish
flavour
definitely
better
than
i
expected
for
something
that
probably
can
be
classed
as
swill
4
99
a
six
pack
of
11
5
ounce
brown
bottles
d
to
put
it
bluntly
you
could
get
bombed
on
this
stuff
a
little
more
alcohol
combined
with
a
taste
that
encourages
mass
consumption
of
a
not
too
filling
beer
at
a
reasonable
price
i
paid
22
00
for
a
case
this
beer
is
a
great
party
beer
to
drink
all
night
long
mouthfeel
was
light
and
crisp
and
a
bit
dry
with
a
higher
than
average
amount
of
carbonation
a
very
drinkable
beer
overall
my
impressions
are
that
this
is
an
average
offering
from
labatt
not
bad
but
nothing
worth
raving
over
drinkability
i
grew
up
on
labatts
50
and
find
that
it
is
one
of
my
go
to
beers
although
it
is
imported
i
consider
it
a
glorified
domestic
ranking
higher
than
the
macros
of
the
u
s
the
taste
is
consistently
very
good
and
has
yet
to
let
me
down
drinkability
i
had
to
rate
this
a
5
since
there
have
been
many
many
nights
of
plenty
with
this
beer
ive
enjoyed
it
for
years
and
years
and
its
always
a
great
standby
with
great
taste
refreshment
and
character

good
beer
for
watching
hockey
football
reading
a
good
book
or
spending
time
with
friends
when
i
serve
it
at
home
to
company
the
reaction
is
usually
something
along
the
lines
of
50
i
have
not
had
one
of
those
for
awhile
its
not
craft
beer
but
its
still
not
bad
worth
a
try
poured
a
medium
and
very
lightly
hazy

color
wtih
a
smaller
sized
white
head
aromas
of
some
citric
lemons
grainy
and
some
grassiness
tastes
of
grains
and
some
malty
sweetness
thinner
body
another
one
that
isnt
anything
too
special
but
drinkable
not
a
bad
beer
and
the
can
is
pretty
neat
written
in
french
this
is
real
nice
offering
from
labatt
but
in
my
opinion
only
2nd
to
blue
i
have
a
soft
spot
for
that
beer
anyway
pours
out
a
really
golden
yellow
color
looks
like
pee
smell
is
good
smells
very
fresh
malt
up
front
with
a
citrusy
smell
in
the
back
this
has
a
really
smooth
and
crisp
taste
malt
up
front
just
like
the
smell
and
a
crisp
hot
bitterness
at
the
finish
very
full
mouthfeel
very
satisfying
this
is
a
great
beer
to
pound
all
night
something
you
can
relax
with
when
cold
it
is
easy
to
drink
alot
of
this
this
is
labatts
answer
to
molsons
export
and
i
think
this
is
much
much
better
but
unfortunately
it
is
harder
to
find
at
bars
i
highly
recommend
this
one
nothing
impressive
here
a
totally
average
ale
that
said
this
is
far
better
than
labatts
blue
not
assertive
in
any
regard
there
is
a
faint
hop
bitterness
with
a
slightly
watery
malt
backbone
a
beer
that
would
pair
well
with
pizza
or
a
burger
and
is
easy
to
drink
nothing
really
wrong
here
but
nothing
outstanding
either
pours
a
threefingered

from

emporium
concord
nh
an
american
style
pale
ale
from
canada
that
drinks
more
like
a
pilsner

a
pale

like
dry
straw
no

at
all
an
aroma
like
budweiser
only
not
so
sour
surprisingly
easy

starts
a

on
the

but
finishes
bitter
down
the
middle
a
little
hops
a
little
malt
lightly
carbonated
ok
mouthfeel
but
very
little
body
for
a
big
big
brewery
this
is
a
pretty
decent
brew
wouldnt
turn
my
nose
up
at
it
if
offered
but
wouldnt
request
it
either
now
this
isnt
a
bad
beer
but
theres
little
resemblance
to
a
typical
apa
its
more
of
what
id
call
a
macro
ale
as
it
reminds
me
a
great
deal
of
a
macro
lager
the
taste
is
slight
and
sweet
and
the
carbonation
is
a
bit
sharp
the
flavor
isnt
bad
when
you
pick
it
apart
husky
grain
and
white
bread
with
a
sweet
green
apple
note
theres
even
a
hint
of
hops
for
balance
but
this
is
closer
to
a
blonde
ale
than
anything
else
i
can
think
of
in
the
ale
category
on

with

cream

oh
yeah
and
lacing
is
actually
there
evenly
with
each
sip
fine
even
and
intricate
on
my
chalice
aroma
contains
an
actual
mild
citrus
and
herbal
toned
hop
profile
with
a
minimal
amount
of
cereal
sweetness
and
mild
perfume
like
accents
flavor
wise
some
residual
honey
like
sweetness
after
the
crisp
light
malt
grain
and
adjuncts
clear
mineral
water
with
a
trace
of
citric
and
herbal
hop
kick
just
peaking
through
in
the
finish
mouthfeel
is
light
bodied
carbonation
does
tickle
the
back
of
the
throat
but
overall
quite
unremarkable
drinkability
is
mediocre
this
is
definitely
a
macro
brew
that
i
can
do
without
all
in
all
the
drinkabilitty
was
good
without
sacrificing
body
this
is
much
preferable
to
most
macro
lagers
and
should
be
recognized
d
ehhh
ill
pass
but
id
drink
this
over
blue
john
labatt
classic
is
still
the
best
out
of
the
bunch
though
had
this
sitting
in
the
fridge
and
just
needed
a
beer
pours
a
bright
flourescent
pale
yellow
color
with
plenty
of
sudsy
white
head
smell
is
somewhat
skunky
with
grainy
corn
type
aroma
taste
is
sweet
with
the
malt
of
plenty
of
a
grain
taste
mouth
feel
is
crisp
and
refreshing
good
style
on
a
hot
summer
day
so
i
guess
i
drank
this
at
the
wrong
time
and
yea
whats
up
with
the
11
5
oz
bottles
shame
on
you
so
if
youre
looking
to
put
back
a
12pack
and
not
too
concerned
about
flavor
this
might
not
be
your
worst
choice
d
this
is
an
okay
apa
probably
one
of
labatts
best
brews
but
it
really
lacks
in
hop
character
overall
a
decent
and
easy
drinking
ale
dreally
doesnt
exhibit
many
outstanding
qualities
kind
of
a
basic
run
of
the
mill
golden
ale
certainly
not
at
all
similar
to
the
good
apas
ive
had
id
never
buy
it
again
but
if
given
one
id
have
no
problem
putting
it
down
smooth
drinkability
aid
this
beer
and
its
appeal
to
go
with
food
12oz
brown
bottle
this
one
labeled
labatt
50
my
last
one
was
labatt
canadian
ale
pours
clear
straw
yellow
with
a
thin
film
of
offwhite
head
smells
somewhat
malty
with
adjuncts
and
dms
playing
roles
in
the
aroma
as
well
tastes
like
biscuit
malt
with
a
small
amount
of
american
hops
and
adjunct
flavor
as
well
pretty
drinkable
and
more
tasty
than
most
macrobeers
having
said
that
there
are
definitely
better
examples
of
the
style
with
a
lower
price
tag
good
for
what
it
is
though
and
better
than
labatt
blue
i
dont
like
how
my
labatt
50
comes
in
11
5
ounce
bottles
the
canucks
are
robbing
me
of
a
half
an
ounce
of
beer
per
bottle
in
this
situation
i
dont
really
mind
the
beers
pretty
mediocre
its
pale
gold
with
a
white
head
that
goes
away
quickly
i
smell
a
musty
hoplike
odor
that
i
wouldnt
say
is
a
very
good
its
not
too
horrible
but
not
a
great
smell
tastes
like
a
typical
macrobrew
thats
trying
to
sell
something
as
being
special
i
dont
know
what
ingredients
im
tasting
here
corn
rice
some
stinky
hops
the
beers
ok
i
dont
think
ill
buy
it
again
but
if
someone
wants
to
give
me
one
for
free
ill
take
it
pours
a
medium
golden
color
with
a
head
that
never
seems
to
rise
much
aroma
is
somewhat
fruity
and
some
malt
shines
through
ive
always
heard
good
things
about
this
beer
but
it
never
was
widely
available
in
this
area
until
now
taste
is
somewhat
bitter
and
malty
with
some
chewiness
better
than
i
expected
a
second
sip
confirms
it
the
only
thing
i
dont
like
is
the
aftertaste
but
other
than
that
this
isnt
a
bad
choice
for
something
made
by
labatts
drank
it
right
from
the
bottle
at
a
barbeque
on
a
95
degree
day
i
was
not
expecting
much
expected
a
bmc
i
was
suprised
this
beer
had
a
nice
light
character
with
a
slight
malt
flavor
easy
to
drink
even
though
there
were
a
few
beers
available
that
i
have
not
sampled
i
went
back
for
a
second
canadian
ale
i
would
add
this
to
my
list
of
beers
worthy
of
a
six
pack
purchase
being
that
labatt
is
more
available
than
the
others
when
i
get
a
craving
and
im
not
in
ballantines
area
that
is
a
long
stretch
for
an
average
beer
better
than
labatts
blue
i
guess
da
could
not
finish
d
easy
to
drink
but
just
like
every
other
basic
blond
beer
had
it
with
pizza
which
was
a
good
match
pours
golden
with
a
bit
of
head
much
like
any
other
macro
smells
sweet
but
i
get
a
sensation
of
hops
which
i
find
pleasant
taste
more
or
less
like
the
smell
with
a
hint
of
hops
rarely
found
in
a
macro
mouthfeel
is
nice
not
overpowering
but
not
to
watery
the
highlight
of
this
beer
is
most
certainly
drinkablity
you
could
easily
find
yourself
drinking
one
to
many
and
i
have
yet
to
find
something
that
flows
like
a
50
i
still
havent
had
what
i
would
consider
a
good
beer
from
labatt
canadian
ale
might
the
best
so
far
because
its
actually
drinkable
in
a
gotta
be
cold
kind
of
way
too
bad
it
isnt
as
widely
available
south
of
the
49th
parallel
as
is
labatt
blue
not
that
it
matters
to
me
i
dont
care
if
i
ever
drink
either
one
of
them
again
labatt
canadian
ale
is
indeed
an
ale
it
was
launched
as
labatt
50
in
1950
and
was
canadas
bestselling
beer
until
1979
it
pours
a
deep
golden
color
and
raises
a
fingerthick
head
of
creamy
white
froth
the
head
retention
is
slightly
better
than
average
and
it
leaves
some
nice
lace
about
the
glass
the
nose
is
mainly
malty
basic
and
sweetish
and
theres
a
light
touch
of
fruity
yeastiness
its
medium
bodied
and
gently
crisp
across
the
palate
the
flavor
offers
a
very
well
balanced
combination
of
gently
sweet
malt
a
mild
yeasty
fruitiness
and
some
leafy
and
mildly
grassy
hops
its
still
a
basic
golden
ale
but
theres
more
to
it
than
most
golden
lagers
offer
it
finishes
dry
with
a
drop
of
sweet
maltiness
that
fades
quickly
leaving
behind
a
refreshing
bitterness
and
some
dull
lingering
hops
an
interesting
and
refreshing
golden
ale
50
pours
a
light
golden
color
with
a
white
sticky
head
smell
is
slightly
grainy
and
malty
taste
is
sweet
malt
with
a
hint
of
hops
at
8
a
12
pack
you
really
cant
beat
it
for
the
price
labatt
canadian
is
definitely
one
of
the
best
macros
around
my
favorite
for
sure
poured
in
nonic
glass
achieving
a
surprising
2
finger
head
that
collapsed
but
held
its
own
down
the
glass
stickinglacing
straw
colored
with
med
to
high
carbonation
smell
is
slightly
fruity
flavor
is
grainy
up
front
with
medium
bitterness
then
slight
fruit
takes
over
and
finishing
with
good
hop
bite
i
get
a
little
adjunct
flavor
near
the
end
but
not
bad
as
some
macro
lagersales
mouthfeel
is
average
but
good
for
a
lighter
ale
seems
to
be
a
throw
back
that
to
me
is
very
refreshing
and
satisfying
pretty
easy
on
the
wallet
bought
in
the
detroit
metro
area
for
about
9
50
a
12
pack
the
mouthfeel
is
decent
and
the
drinkability
is
also
i
really
dont
get
overly
tired
of
this
beer
and
weve
been
doing
the
tango
for
a
few
months
now
it
is
a
paele
gold
with
a
head
that
is
about
2
inches
and
disapears
quickly
it
smell
is
pretty
malty
and
not
very
present
tatse
of
somr
amlt
and
with
very
distnict
bitternes
it
was
very
pleasent
compared
to
other
labatt
brews
ive
tried
carbonation
is
pretty
present
when
in
teh
mouth
and
kinda
of
hides
some
of
the
taste
overall
a
very
drinkable
beer
that
can
be
enjoyed
but
obviosully
needs
improvement
i
will
never
order
this
one
again
not
drinkable
at
all
considering
aroma
is
a
large
part
of
my
taste
in
beer
the
only
reason
i
ordered
this
in
the
first
place
was
out
of
curiosity
and
im
trying
to
finish
up
my
world
tour
at
a
local
pub
pours
crystal
clear
pale
gold
a
one
and
a
half
finger
head
of
dense
bubbles
shows
decent
retention
and
some
spotty
lacing
aromas
of
pale
malt
and
mild
noble
hops
sweet
munich
and
spicy
pilsener
malts
make
up
a
decent
malt
flavor
but
the
taste
is
still
mild
classic
semidry
german
hops
in
the
aftertaste
are
barely
noticed
in
an
otherwise
clean
finish
what
it
lacks
in
flavor
it
makes
up
for
with
an
excellent
balance
mediumlow
carbonation
with
a
light
body
that
combines
with
crisp
malt
profile
for
a
smooth
mouthfeel
and
good
drinkability
drinkability
well
not
bad
for
the
style
rather
refreshing
but
taking
cost
into
account
there
are
many
beers
of
comparable
quality
that
are
easier
on
the
wallet
nothing
special
like
most
macros
this
one
doesnt
have
much
flavor
upfront
but
it
does
have
a
nice
dry
finish
however
its
too
bland
for
a
session
beer
this
review
is
based
on
numerous
bottled
samples
this
stuff
is
quite
enjoyable
its
not
as
clean
or
smooth
as
labatt
blue
or
the
better
molsons
but
its
more
flavorful
reminds
me
of
the
way
my
fathers
beer
tasted
in
the
60s
and
70s
before
just
about
all
those
old
brands
got
watered
down
the
taste
really
settles
in
and
makes
sense
if
you
happen
to
be
smoking
a
cigarette
at
the
time
as
well
not
surprising
given
this
was
released
to
market
in
1950
the
latter
part
of
the
dear
old
swing
era
by
no
means
the
best
available
in
todays
beer
market
if
you
have
the
oof
and
can
afford
to
sling
it
around
a
bit
but
hard
to
beat
at
18
50
a
case
retail
in
worcester
if
you
have
to
watch
the
decimals
that
makes
it
a
bit
pricier
than
the
standard
us
macros
but
its
pronouncedly
better
than
those
as
well
as
a
surprising
number
of
more
expensive
brands
such
as
corona
usually
about
21
a
case
a
pleasant
throwback
perfectly
preserved
after
55
years
and
shrewdly
priced
to
boot
drinkability
underated
this
brand
exists
since
several
decades
and
it
used
to
be
trendy
long
years
ago
so
drink
it
in
a
nightclub
will
be
you
looking
funny
but
it
is
still
a
hidden
gem
in
the
current
world
of
canadian
macros
decided
to
give
this
one
a
shot
because
of
a
1
00
price
tag
for
a
single
i
guess
i
got
my
moneys
worth
pours
a
clear
golden
color
with
mild
bubbles
medium
thin
white
head
and
minimal
lacing
the
aroma
is
vaguely
sweet
with
nothing
really
distinguishing
itself
lightbodied
with
a
pretty
bland
flavor
of
mild
hops
and
sweet
corn
luckily
nothing
offensive
in
there
the
finish
is
crisp
dry
and
pretty
much
flavorless
aside
from
the
faintest
hops
bitterness
all
said
its
a
labatt
by
any
other
name
poured
a
straw
yellow
not
much
head
or
retention
smell
was
almost
non
existant
very
little
taste
as
well
lightly
hopped
corn
husk
flavor
mouthfeel
is
thin
and
watery
very
carbonated
drinkability
is
average
at
best
would
make
a
nice
lawnmower
beer
i
tried
this
beer
again
after
a
couple
of
years
and
more
experience
honestly
i
did
not
think
it
was
so
bad
a
mildly
hoppy
and
malty
beer
with
high
carbonation
a
more
rounded
out
maltiness
and
drier
than
labatt
blue
a
simple
golden
ale
that
is
thirst
quenching
and
nonoffensive
to
the
average
beer
drinker
which
is
mostly
not
a
good
thing
recommended
if
your
other
option
is
a
bmc
or
other
labatt
product
bottle
poured
a
golden
color
ale
with
almost
no
head
aroma
is
very
weak
almost
nonexistent
taste
is
a
mix
between
some
sweet
malt
and
light
bitterness
better
then
most
crap
that
labatt
produce
but
this
is
still
macro
beer
without
taste
im
not
even
sure
this
one
should
qualify
as
american
pale
ale
the
best
of
the
american
labatts
that
you
can
get
in
my
opinion
medium
to
high
carbonation
light
bubbly
head
that
is
short
lived
golden
yellow
color
that
is
typical
of
well
made
beers
this
beer
has
more
flavor
that
regular
labatts
and
would
be
more
to
the
liking
of
those
who
prefer
a
more
complex
beer
flavors
of
malt
and
hops
were
most
present
overall
i
see
this
beer
as
far
over
looked
and
highly
underated
worth
a
try
if
you
have
never
had
it
the
beer
pours
a
pale
gold
color
with
a
thick
frothy
white
head
that
quickly
fades
to
lacing
the
aroma
is
decent
it
has
a
clean
crisp
scent
that
boasts
of
grainy
pale
malts
lager
yeast
and
some
hops
the
taste
is
decent
also
it
has
a
basic
pale
malt
flavor
along
with
a
dry
lager
yeast
finish
it
goes
down
easy
and
finishes
clean
the
mouthfeel
is
fine
it
is
a
low
bodied
beer
with
good
carbonation
this
is
a
good
drinking
beer
it
has
an
above
average
makeup
but
it
goes
down
quick
and
easy
pours
an
unpromising
translucent
pale
golden
color
ive
seen
pilseners
a
deeper
shade
of
gold
than
this
the
heads
pretty
adequate
but
the
overall
carbonation
left
is
low
and
a
few
bubble
streamers
bready
grainy
malts
and
a
flickering
of
floral
hops
but
not
much
in
either
department
aromawise
corn
is
present
in
the
aroma
too
overall
taste
is
rather
subdued
whitebready
and
thin
on
the
malt
and
thin
on
the
hops
slightly
crisp
but
thats
one
of
its
only
assets
pours
out
a
clear
straw
yellow
with
a
light
bright
white
head
nice
and
smooth
with
a
halfway
decent
malt
profile
crisp
hop
balance
very
light
and
drinkable
a
macro
ale
if
there
ever
was
one
but
a
macro
ale
done
right
easy
to
drink
and
tastes
good
enough
to
enjoy
a
good
backup
beer
if
only
american
and
canadian
macros
are
available
at
the
beer
store
clear
gold
colour
with
a
bright
white
head
which
stuck
around
for
a
couple
minutes
and
left
light
lacing
on
the
glass
very
light
aroma
with
some
malt
and
a
light
hop
character
bitterness
served
as
a
base
for
the
light
flavour
and
it
carried
through
to
the
dry
finish
some
malt
sweetness
at
the
beginning
that
didnt
last
long
light
bodied
and
fairly
smooth
not
a
bad
thirst
quencher
labatt
is
as
popular
around
here
as
snow
its
everywhere
but
i
dont
come
across
the
canadian
ale
too
often
its
very
pale
amber
colour
with
little
head
if
any
at
all
is
its
weakest
point
other
than
that
its
not
a
bad
beer
a
bit
of
a
plain
taste
but
there
are
hints
of
earthy
hops
as
smooth
as
an
ale
can
get
drinkability
doesnt
do
much
for
me
in
fact
i
just
assumed
it
was
a
pale
lager
and
not
a
pale
ale
it
was
an
average
lager
but
makes
for
a
wretched
pale
ale
at
8
99
a
12pack
ill
pass
as
there
is
far
better
to
come
from
a
can
a
cheaper
at
that
is
it
ale
or
lager
i
dunno
but
its
great
if
you
like
belching
a
canadian
ale
that
is
brewed
like
a
lager
leaving
very
little
distinctive
character
the
beer
looks
like
a
typical
canandian
lager
in
the
glass
pale
gold
color
with
a
wispy
head
the
aroma
is
corn
sweetness
and
very
faint
fruit
notes
the
taste
is
clean
corn
sweetness
and
faded
yeast
flavors
not
distinctive
at
all
as
are
most
canadian
beers
this
is
a
very
clean
drinkable
beer
but
not
much
different
than
any
of
the
other
macros
from
canada
this
is
quite
drinkable
although
the
only
remarkable
quality
about
it
is
that
it
doesnt
taste
too
bad
compared
with
other
macroales
this
is
a
step
above
compared
to
some
real
ales
this
is
nothing
all
in
all
a
decent
labatt
offering
if
they
say
this
is
canadian
ale
though
i
cant
be
too
harsh
this
isnt
a
good
beer
taste
is
even
but
weak
but
thankfully
generic
hop
bitterness
manages
what
would
be
overbearing
flaked
corn
sweetness
hop
flavor
is
virtually
non
existant
the
finish
is
of
yellow
corn
wheres
my
butter
and
a
hint
of
bready
grain
although
labett
canadian
ale
isnt
a
bad
brew
light
ale
and
something
of
a
training
wheel
beer
to
get
macrodrinkers

almost
frozen
citrus
smell
and
taste
goes
down
easy
great
beer
for
a
hot
summer
day
great
tasting
beer
very
refreshing
good
beer
to
drink
on
a
warm
day
no
bite
on
the
back
end
1st
beer
in
severna
park
this
was
ontap
at
the
astros
spring
training
facility
in
kissimmee
fl
on
a
hot
90
degree
day
where
i
literally
turned
red
from
sunburn
i
couldnt
have
asked
for
a
better
beer
it
was
a
good
hoppy
while
being
exceptionally
refreshing
and
having
a
clean
finish
i
walked
away
very
impressed
i
really
like
the
kona
offerings
not
sure
golden
ales
are
supposed
to
be
this
hoppy
but
it
was
too
bitter
for
my
taste
golden
ales
can
be
difficult
to
pull
off
kona
did
a
good
job
though
overall
ive
had
bad
experiences
with
kona
so
i
wasnt
expecting
much
but
was
actually
pleasantly
surprised
3

paws
my
go
to
beer
one
of
my
favorites
clean
crisp
and
smooth
yet
has
enough
character
to
keep
it
interesting
to
me
it
is
what
i
base
all
other
golden
ales
on
very
light
golden
orange
color
the
smell
is
faintly
metallic
but
that
doesnt
carry
over
to
the
taste
it
has
a
malty
flavor
that
isnt
overpowering
smooth
and
flavorful
no
bad
beer
aftertaste
at
all
mild
carbonation
gives
it
a
good
overall
feel
and
taste
darker
than
id
expect
for
the
style
a
little
too
malty
for
my
taste
not
fond
of
this
one
o
this
is
not
a
bad
blonde
ale
i
could
see
this
really
hitting
the
spot
on
a
hot
day
overall
quite
delicious
very
refreshing
with
loads
of
citrus
zest
if
you
are
in
hawaii
drinking
this
how
can
you
not
enjoy
this
beer
overall
its
a
good
ale
and
would
be
a
superior
one
if
it
werent
for
the
rush
of
garbage
hop
that
comes
in
halfway
through
the
taste
that
being
said
id
have
it
again
and
share
it
with
friends
it
is
one
of
the
best
golden
ales
ive
had
and
is
satisfying
and
smooth
really
good
and
sweet
but
all
in
all
its
alright
how
this
could
he
anything
less
then
a
5
blows
my
mind
light
crisp
refreshing
and
that
hint
of
island
that
makes
you
feel
like
your
in
hawaii
very
unique
brew
pours
a
goldenyellow
in
color
with
a
thinner
white
foamy
head
some
spotty
lacing
is
seen
when
sipped
that
sticks
to
the
sides
of
the
glass
the
aroma
is
of
some
yeast
grass
with
a
hint
of
fruit
even
more
going
on
with
the
taste
as
there
are
some
light
hops
grass
and
hay
very
tasty
and
goes
down
easy
lighterbodied
with
perfect
carbonation
really
liked
this
brew
and
a
easy
solid

this

i
say
this
in

with
a
spicy

element
from

leading
the
flavor
the
body
is

the

for
that
reason
im
lowering
the
overall
score
a
bit
i
guess
i
was
expecting
an
ale
with
fruit
or
maybe
something
shandylike
for
that
reason
i
am
somewhat
let
down
i
have
to
get
past
that
however
and
rate
it
as
a
pale
ale
in
that
regard
it
is
pretty
good
not
quite
as
good
as
mirror
pond
but
a
fair
shake
is
owed
to
twilight
summer
ale
poured
from
a
brown
12
oz
bottle
has
a
rich
golden
color
with
a
12
inch
head
smell
is
of
malts
biscuits
taste
is
citrus
floral
hops
malts
kicking
in
at
the
finish
very
high
drinkability
feels
medium
bodied
in
the
mouth
and
overall
makes
a
fine
session
beer
this
is
a
decent
good
tasting
beer
but
it
fails
badly
as
a
blonde
ale
there
is
nothing
blonde
aleish
about
it
smooth
and
solid
an
easy
drinking
pale
ale
taste
overall
solid
refreshing
easydrinking
red
ale
nothing
over
the
top
nothing
spectacular
but
a
well
built
beer
that
is
pretty
easy
to
drink
rating
b
clear
light
yellow
body
big
white
foamy
head
aroma
of
lemon
and
malt
spiced
malty
lemon
pledge
taste
only
ok
o
this
is
a
simple
and
incredibly
enjoyable
summer
ale
the
bright
and
delicate
hop
character
blends
perfectly
with
the
malt
character
feel
lively
medium
carbonation
near
medium
body
brilliant
deep
golden
with
copper
highlights
and
a
frothy
cream
head
aroma
is
zesty
with
grass
light
floral
notes
and
that
signature
amarillo
savory
character
theres
a
hint
of
bready
malt
flavor
is
slightly
fruity
likely
attributable
to
specialty
malt
with
floral
perfumey
notes
a
touch
of
citrus
and
a
grassy
almost
piney
earthy
crisp
finish
very
clean
and
refreshing
though
the
perfumey
character
is
somewhat
overwhelming
overall
a
nice
version
of
a
blonde
ale
maybe
a
bit
more
hoppy
than
other
examples
but
it
is
a
great
thirst
quencher
with
good
flavor
to
boot
bottle
came
from
a
too
warm
cooler
net
result
being
that
some
qualities
of
the
beer
are
exaggerated
good
others
less
appearance
is
great
with
a
huge
frothy
head
and
lots
of
lace
aroma
is
fruit
and
hops
with
a
little
grain
and
malt
body
because
of
temp
is
hard
to
gauge
aftertaste
may
have
been
affected
by
a
shot
of
rye
whiskey
which
gave
it
some
not
so
good
flavs
o
great
beer
for
a
hot
summers
day
nice
grapefruit
flavor
very
refreshing
theres
a
very
gentle
bite
in
the
feel
and
it
starts
on
the
tongue
leaning
sweeter
before
hitting
semidry
and
keeping
light
dryness
on
the
tongue
the
rest
of
the
way
crispness
nips
lightly
and
doesnt
give
out
while
smoothness
comes
through
nicely
overall
a
very
crisp
and
refreshing
beer
im
typically
not
a
fan
of
the
summer
ale

than
i
did
cant

what
it
is
i
didnt
really

for
think
i
wanted
a

brew
like

instead
was
surprised
by
the

this
one
packs
definitely
not
a

beer
drank
it
pretty

just
probably
wont
add
it
to
my

beer
list

very

like
something
youd
get
at

in

town
not
worthy
of
the
deschutes
brand
overall
drinkability
you
have
to
be
in
a
hoppy
mood
because
this
one
will
linger
on
your
tongue
for
a
while
overall
not
bad
at
all
here
this
was
a
very
good
little
session
ale
that
i
would
have
no
issue
at
all
with
trying
out
again
some
day
another
solid
seasonal
from
deschutes
here
overall
a
good
apa
lots
of
flavor
and
easy
drinking
o
a
well
crafted
beer
it
was
more
than
i
expected
to
receive
for
a
summery
beer
6
99
for
6
pack
on
sale
looks
like
a
steal
now
the
hop
taste
will
surprise
some
read
the
bottle
after
drinking
beer
as
it
mentioned
amarillo
hops
it
wasnt
bad
just
nothing
special
with
so
many
great
apas
out
there
and
easily
found
i
wouldnt
get
this
again
pours
is
a
moderate
golden
color
with
a
slight
amount
of
haze
white
head
with
good
retention
nice
ringy
lacing
on
the
way
down
nose
is
some
light
citrus
hops
and
a
bit
of
bread
nothing
terribly
complicated
but
it
works
well
in
the
nose
at
the
same
time
the
taste
seems
a
bit
too
tame
good
feel
with
a
nice
balance
perfect
level
of
bitterness
to
drink
quite
a
few
of
during
a
sitting
d
nice
brew
i
like
it
theres
no
doubt
about
that
but
whether
or
not
ill
buy
it
again
is
up
for
debate
i
prolly
will
middle
of
next
summer
just
to
see
how
it
is
then
overall
a
pretty
average
pale
ale
i
would
expect
more
from
deschutes
hopefully
next
summer
they
will
revamp
their
seasonal
poured
from
a
12oz
bottle
into
a
shaker
glass
color
is
a
little
orangeamber
with
a
small
head
and
minimal
lacing
taste
was
sweet
malt
a
good
thing
with
a
bit
of
citrusy
flavor
to
boot
very
smooth
crisp
and
quite
drinkable
will
definitely
look
for
this
again
next
summer
well
done
deschutes
o
not
an
amazing
beer
by
the
brewerys
standards
but
it
will
appeal
to
a
very
wide
market
thanks
to
wagenvolks
for
the
trade
12oz
bottle
into
a
dfh
signature
glass
pours
a
crisp
bubbly
light
orange
with
a
thin
off
white
head
that
diminishes
to
barely
a
ring
and
leaves
just
a
trace
of
lacing
on
the
glass
aroma
is
crisp
earthy
citrus
hops
in
front
of
sweet
malts
the
taste
is
a
nice
amount
of
sweet
malts
balanced
nicely
balanced
by
crisp
citrus
hops
the
beer
is
quite
smooth
crisp
and
refreshing
with
great
smooth
carbonation
a
great
summer
beer
even
on
a
cool
late
summer
night
dthis
is
a
pale
ale
really
hmmm
it
was
easy
to
drink
but
too
bitter
to
enjoy
repeatedly
if
you
were
in
the
mood
for
a
summerpale
ale
d
a
mild
and
light
pale
ale
that
does
the
style
justice
not
my
favorite
brew
or
style
but
for
what
it
is
it
is
done
well
i
really
wish
this
brew
were
available
in
12ers
here
in
austin
as
a
sixpack
just
goes
too
fast
if
you
live
in
a
warm
climate
like
i
do
this
could
easily
be
a
great
yearround
drinker
as
there
isnt
one
bit
of
that
seasonal
type
of
novelty
feel
to
this
beer
that
tends
to
pertain
to
a
lot
of
the
more
fruity
wheat
beers
a
lot
of
craft
brewers
tend
to
release
best
of
all
deschutes
is
one
of
the
only
craft
brewers
im
aware
of
that
does
not
follow
the
norm
of
releasing
their
seasonal
brews
two
months
before
the
actual
season
this
way
you
get
to
enjoy
the
beer
fresh
when
you
should
actually
be
drinking
it
what
a
concept
poured
a
golden
amber
brown
with
a
half
finger
of
head
and
left
a
little
bit
of
lacing
sticking
to
the
glass
the
nose
was
citrusy
with
a
mild
hop
aroma
and
had
hints
of
caramel
it
also
had
orange
zest
notes
as
well
the
flavors
were
pretty
much
the
same
as
the
nose
but
the
caramel
malts
were
more
potent
on
the
palate
but
had
citrus
and
hop
accents
that
had
a
good
balance
the
brew
was
medium
body
with
a
good
amount
of
carbonation
that
had
a
slight
sweet
but
citric
hop
bitter
clean
finish
very
good
it
drank
really
good
and
is
a
good
session
beer
on
a
hot
summer
day
in
socal
poolside
with
some
bbq
very
drinkable
a
little
milder
than
their
mirror
pond
pale
ale
its
an
easy
drinking
beer
it
wasnt
the
most
flavorful
beer
ive
had
but
the
balance
made
it
pretty
easy
drinking
decent
beer
overall

i
could
only

that
this
beer
would
hit
the
spot
on
a
summer
day
at
a
bbq
light
in
body
with
hardly
any
noticeable
carbonation
unfortunately
i
just
found
this
brew
to
be
too
light
in
taste
and
body
though
it
was
hardly
bad
just
not
great
probably
would
not
have
again
o
really
a
spot
on
blonde
with
the
drinkability
i
desire
and
subtly
to
offer
intrigue
totally
wish
this
was
more
regularly
distro
in
my
area
as
i
would
purchase
more
often
o
ill
go
with
a
solid
b
on
this
one
its
perfect
for
a
hot
summer
day
for
sure
really
solid
pale
ale
that
had
a
nice
hit
of
hops
behind
the
beer
it
was
crisp
and
refreshing
as
youd
expect
in
a
pale
ale
but
as
the
name
suggests
you
get
a
bit
of
noticeable
hops
throughout
the
beer
that
really
give
it
some
added
complexity
and
round
out
the
whole
beer
o
not
a
bad
drinking
blonde
a
definite
session
as
an
apa
this
is
not
too
bad
however
as
the
badictated
blonde
ale
style
this
is
the
shit
a
nice
light
ale
just
hinting
of
what
is
possible
in
greater
cascadia
hops
on
standdown
but
not
lacking
presence
if
that
makes
sense
anyways
a
good
ol
yankee
session
ale
if
i
ever
saw
one
crisp
malty
aroma
has
a
decided
overtone
of
fresh
apple
it
pours
a
lovely
clear
golden
amber
with
a
thick
fluffy
white
head
malty
flavor
has
a
fruity
and
slightly
sweet
undertone
and
a
bit
of
yeast
as
well
as
a
slight
edgy
metallic
tang
that
actually
adds
to
the
flavor
texture
is
rather
fizzy
and
wellrounded
leaving
a
pleasing
finish
recommended
to
all
lovers
of
golden
ales
thanks
to
cyberkedi
for
this
one
a
decent
pale
ale
though
a
bit
lacking
of
hops
for
my
liking
and
just
a
bit
lackluster
in
general
o
a
very
fine
product
indeed
if
this
was
available
in
my
area
i
could
see
this
quickly
becoming
a
goto
beer
for
me
great
on
its
own
or
as
a
marinademeal
beer
this
really
hits
the
spot
i
highly
recommend
this
and
will
seek
it
out
whenever
im
in
the
good
ol
usa
ok
after
doing
some
research
on
the
deschutes
website
i
found
out
that
this
is
not
a
pale
ale
its
a
blonde
so
who
ever
posted
this
beer
messed
up
big
time
with
this
new
information
i
understand
the
flavor
a
little
bit
more
but
its
not
enough
for
me
to
change
this
beer
rating
its
still
not
up
to
par
with
anything
else
deschutes
puts
out
o
really
disappointing
from
deschutes
i
would
pass
on
this
beer
overall
very
nice
beer
and
a
style
that
i
think
is
often
overlooked
it
may
be
easy
for
beer
afficionados
to
discard
this
as
an
adjunct
lager
lookalike
but
its
an
important
beer
a
quality
beer
with
a
role
to
play
its
like
equal
parts
american
pale
ale
kolsch
and
european
lager
i
think
the
classification
as
an
american
pale
ale
gives
the
wrong
impression
best
on
a
warm
day
accompanying
picnics
or
ballgames
dont
expect
to
be
bowled
over
but
expect
a
nice
beer
the
mouthfeel
is
light
and
carbonation
is
moderate
overall
it
was
a
pretty
easy
drinking
beer
but
it
lacked
in
the
flavor
category
my
preference
would
have
been
a
little
more
hop
flavors
to
make
it
interesting
and
to
balance
out
some
of
the
grainy
sweetness
the
flavors
reminded
me
somewhat
of
an
american
light
lager
only
with
ale
characteristics
it
was
easy
to
drink
but
pretty
average
overall
for
the
style
d
light
but
the
bitterness
and
flavor
arent
deep
enough
for
me
could
be
refreshing
during
the
summer
but
i
wish
it
had
more
flavor
besides
the
bitter
hint
nice
and
light
but
with
some
interesting
character
this
would
be
a
great
summer
beer
the
beer
poured
a
light
copper
color
with
a
small
head
that
didnt
last
very
long
the
smell
contained
citrus
hops
and
some
grain
notes
the
smell
is
pleasing
but
not
assertive
the
taste
is
where
this
beer
really
stood
out
and
thats
what
counts
right
cascade
ale
starts
with
a
little
bit
of
citrus
hop
then
transitions
to
some
light
malts
mouthfeel
is
refreshing
and
carbonation
is
playful
this
is
the
best
blonde
ale
i
have
yet
tasted
and
i
like
it
it
ranks
among
the
great
craft
lawnmower
beers
it
strikes
a
balance
between
flavor
and
simplicity
that
is
perfect
for
a
hot
summer
day
th
low
abv
also
makes
is
a
perfect
candidate
for
a
session
on
a
warm
evening
even
in
the
pacific
northwest
where
you
can
find
deschutes
beer
in
your
average
gas
station
you
dont
often
see
cascade
ale
still
this
is
a
quality
beer
as
youd
expect
from
deschutes
for
someone
who
doesnt
like
pilsners
or
light
lagers
but
wants
a
session
beer
this
is
a
good
option
overall
not
a
bad
brew
maybe
i
got
an
old
6
pack
who
knows
i
always
like
the
stuff
this
brewery
puts
out
so
overall
a
very
nice
pale
ale
a
pleasant
change
from
the
overhopped
versions
that
are
just
ipalight
grab
a
sixer
when
you
see
it
and
youll
have
your
new
lawnmower
beer
drinkability
very
solid
i
could
drink
this
all
day
especially
in
the
warm
summer
as
it
would
be
quite
refreshing
nice
flavors
and
a
crisp
and
lighter
body
with
a
low
abv
would
allow
this
to
be
sessioned
as
the
bottle
advertises
there
is
a
pleasant
citrus
kick
towards
the
end
there
is
some
delicious
malt
in
the
middle
but
not
much
up
front
just
when
you
think
youve
found
some
caramel
flavors
they
go
away
refreshing
with
a
very
clean
finish
appearance
has
a
dusty
copper
tone
with
a
thin
head
that
dissipates
leaving
no
lace
smell
of
faint
malt
and
light
fruity
hops
tastes
somewhat
like
a
macro
brew
with
corn
but
with
obvious
malt
light
caramel
with
a
nice
low
hop
background
mouthfeel
is
a
light
medium
with
with
good
carbonation
not
what
i
expected
from
deschutes
but
would
probably
make
for
a
good
summer
session
beer
mouthfeel
there
isnt
any
depth
at
any
stage
i
guess
its
kind
of
drinkable
since
it
doesnt
overload
your
palate
overall
a
nice
herbal
apa
a
very
mediocre
pale
just
wish
it
had
more
oomph
to
it
i
feel
like
some
of
the
underlying
ideas
are
good
i
just
want
to
actually
be
able
to
taste
them
this
is
very
light
and
thin

im
simply
not
impressed
by
this
beer
weak
on
hops
weak
on
malts
no
sophisticated
flavor
profile
hard
to
believe
this
came
from
deschutes
yes
its
old
but
it
shouldnt
have
faded
that
fast
this
would
make
a
great
introduction
to
craft
beer
for
those
accustomed
to
only
bud
miller
and
coors
light
and
crisp
but
with
flavor
i
think
it
does
what
the
brewer
sought
probably
not
hoppy
enough
for
most
craft
beer
enthusiasts
but
i
like
it
better
than
mirror
pond
ale
pours
a
orangeyellow
with
a
finger
of
fizzy
white
head
that
quickly
dissolves
into
a
wispy
layer
the
aroma
is
grassy
herbal
hops
with
some
touches
of
honey
and
caramel
malt
the
flavor
is
sweet
malt
upfront
and
followed
by
a
soft
grassy
hop
bitterness
its
light
bodied
with
lively
carbonation
if
there
is
one
word
to
describe
that
flavors
of
this
beer
it
would
be

its
a
refreshing
beer
and
definitely
nice
on
a
hot
summer
day
but
i
would
reach
for
it
otherwise
drinkability
this
is
a
classic
sessionable
beer
that
has
a

and
is

and

with
that
fresh

that
you
would

from
a

not
only
that
but
everything
you
would
expect
from

taste
is

and
the

for
a

mouthfeel
is
fine
maybe
a

watery
but
that
works
great
for
this

drinkability
is

could
see
this
as

as
an
alternative

enjoyed
the
mild

and
liked
that

not
big

feel
but
didnt
expect
it
from
this
type
of

would
definitely
buy
again
if

the

without

toasty

light
in

well
tasty
and
enjoyable
river

may
not
be
flashy
big
or
bold
but
it
remains
a
flavorful
and
welldone
session
ale
that
i
would
gladly
enjoy
time
and
again
prost
overall
its
a
nicely
crafted
ale
with
an
emphasis
on
the
hop
and
yeast
the
hop
is
subdued
enough
to
make
it
enjoyable
and
pairs
well
with
the
yeast
not
something
id
drink
over
and
over
but
this
beer
is
definitely
respectable
well
done

this

enough
to
make

straightforward

you
dont

to
give

overall
pretty

easy

overall
a
refreshing

this
would
be
perfect
for
the
hot
dog
days
of
summer
i
guess
this
is
what
people
would
call
a
session
beer
it
would
take
many
people
3
or
4
of
these
to
get
a
buzz
probably
better
consumed
outside
on
a
hot

day
the
beer
just
doesnt
have
enough
substance
for
me
great

just
a
overall
wonderful
taste
crisp
with
the
right
amount
of
hop
notes
served
from
a
bottle
poured
into
a

overall
this
is
a

not

its
inoffensive
and
could

this
is
just
a

more

than
your

there
is
quite
a

going

this
puts
some
pizzazz
into
the
average
boring
blonde
ale
the
flavors
are
exceptionally
clean
and
i
could
put
back
a
ton
of
these
without
getting
tiired
of
it
deschutes
really
does

oct

i
got
this
on
tap
toward
the
end
of
the
summer
but
it
wasnt
my
favorite
deschutes
brew
just
didnt
quite
stack
up
to
some
of
their
other
offerings
almost
a
witbier
or
belgian
white
as
compared
to
the
blonde
that
its
classified
as
here
decent
but
probably
wouldnt
pick
that
one
if
other
deschutes
products
were
available
overall
incredibly
impressive
golden
ale
as
they
describe
it
on
the
label
i
know
i
could
drink
this
as
a
dessert
island
beer
for
sustainability
o
this
is
super
easy
to
drink
and
it
has
excellent
balance
its
much
more
complex
than
other
blondes
probably
because
its
so
hop
forward
i
liked
it
o
refreshing
and
fairly
light
works
well
as
a
session
beer
not
incredibly
flavorful
but
flavors
that
are
present
work
well

oh
so
thats
where
the
brewery
got
its

this

the

comprises

beers
from
the

kick

extra

very
moderately
vigorous

frothy

white
the

is
a
great
balance
of
grassy

hoppiness
and
straightforward

a

a

of
toast
this
is
a
very
good

type

i
think
or
a

american
pa
in
any
case
a
very
drinkable

together
overall
i
am
hoping
this
beer
will
grow
on
me
i
generally
enjoy
golden
and
blond
ales
but
this
seems
a
little
strange
to
me
thus
far
it
is
not
bad
neither
is
it
great
i
was
expecting
more
as
i
have
always
been
pleased
with
deschutes
products
the
beer
just
seems
to
lack
a
proper
balance
and
is
more
hop
forward
while
lacking
in
the
sweetness
i
am
accustomed
to
in
this
style
i
liked
this
one
a
lot
but
then
again
theres
nothing
that
deschuttes
makes
that
i
dont
like
another
winner
from
this
highly
rated
oregon
brewery
o
really
good
but
im
not
sure
that
id
buy
it
again
hence
the
lower

score

an

you
can
sip
it

ponder
away
or
just

refreshing
with

the

with

and
has
a

up

with
a
mild

the
yeast
brings
a
slight
fruitiness
to
the
taste
which
blends
well
with
the

the
taste
the
overall
drinkability
is
great
i
enjoyed
this
and
for
a

beer
it
is
not

at
all
theres
a

a

flavor
at

goes
down
easy
and
thats
not
a
problem
since
i
could
probably
down
a
sixer
of
this
with
no
ill
effects
a
great
effort
from
deschutes
im
down
with
the
new
session
craze
and
this
falls
right
in
line
with
that
plenty
of
flavor
in
a
small
package
overall
pretty
good
above
average
beer
definitely
worth
a
try
if
youre
looking
for
a
sessionable
summer
beer
its
also
a
good
representation
of
the
style
d
oh
boy
i
really
wanted
this
to
be
something
besides
this
i
was
hoping
for
a
light
hop
presence
and
a
highly
drinkable
summer
brew
instread
this
is
totally
lacking
in
hop
presence
and
is
beat
up
with
diacetyl
overall
a
pleasant
surprise
a
tasty
and
easy
drinking
sessionable
ale
one
of
those
beers
that
is
better
than
the
sums

a

but
have

for

the
beer

overall
just
wish
there
was
a

more
depth

this
is
real

drinking
and
has
a

palate
compared

ive

a
solid
deschutes

it
is
light
on

overall
not
a

blonde
indeed
but
nothing
i
would
seek
out
again
like

ale
that
well
tastes
like
an
ale
taste
of
crackers
and
not
much
else
to
start
definitely
a
blonde
ale
in
that
regard
some
slight
fruitiness
and
a
little
sweet
malt
no
real
hop
flavor
that
i
can
find
still
its
refreshing
and
drinkable
and
its
hard
to
complain
about
the
mild
flavor
given
the
4
abv
maybe
theyre
brewing
this
for
the
utah
supermarket
trade
from
the
22
oz
bottle
purchased
at
bottleworks
in
san
diego
poured
from
a
355ml
bottle
pours
a
coppery
orangebrownish
amber
colour
the
nose
is
full
of
classic
west
coast
hop
notes
like
pine
grapefruit
and
other
citrus
the
taste
also
has
some
good
fresh
hop
notes
with
some
crackery
malt
as
well
its
quite
light
bodied
and
quaffable
but
with
lots
of
flavour
an
excellent
summertime
session

quite
a

a
good

interest
the
seasoned
craft
beer
drinker
looking
for
something
lighter

nice

as

ok
for
what
it
is
a
good
summer
beer
and
low

is
a
plus
put
this
in
cans
and
this
would
be
in
my
camping
cooler
this
camping
season
cheers
a
nice
blond
with
a
little
more
bitterness
than
normal
overall
both
subtle
and
complex
which
is
not
each
to
do
supremely
drinkable
high
c
delicious
couldve
sworn
there
were
new
world
hops
in
this
beer
one
of
the
best
sub
5
beers
ive
had
wouldnt
expect
anything
less
from
deschutes
overall
a
very
nice
light
drinkable
seasonable
beer
pours
a
light
orange
with
a
yellowish
hue
and
a
slight
white
head
a
couple
effervescent
bubbles
rising
to
top
for
a
little
while
following
the
pour
a
balanced
low
key
but
present
aroma
of
some
grainy
breadiness
paired
with
some
orange
and
its
rind
as
well
as
some
florals
flavor
follows
suit
grainy
and
bready
along
with
some
orange
and
a
slightly
bitter
grassiness
aftertaste
is
what
i
have
come
to
expect
from
blondes
though
with
the
cereal
graininess
a
crisp
active
mouthfeel
overall
a
decent
session
ale
i
wonder
if
they
intend
to
keep
twighlight
around
now
because
this
as
by
far
a
better
blond
ale
and
i
would
never
choose
twighlight
when
i
could
grab
this
instead
overall
a
fine
summer
beer
for
times
when
you
need
less
alcohol
quite
well
done
actually
i
will
be
consuming
more
of
these
this
summer
othis
is
another
pretty
good
beer
from
deschutes
for
a
beer
with
only
4
0
abv
they
really
manage
to
pack
a
lot
of
flavor
in
here
that
being
said
if
you
are
looking
for
a
sweeter
more
maltylagery
example
of
the
style
you
might
look
elsewhere
pours
a
clear
dark
orange
with
a
foamy
bone
colored
head
that
settles
to
a
partial
film
on
top
of
the
beer
foamy
patches
of
lace
form
around
the
glass
on
the
drink
down
smell
is
of
malt
grain
and
some
citrus
zest
aromas
taste
is
much
the
same
with
some
grassy
flavors
on
the
finish
there
is
a
mild
amount
of
hop
bitterness
on
the
palate
with
each
sip
this
beer
has
a
lower
level
of
carbonation
with
a
slightly
crisp
but
somewhat
medium
bodied
mouthfeel
overall
this
is
a
good
beer
that
is
tasty
and
easy
to
drink
especially
with
the
4
abv
one
of
the
better
4
0
abv
session
ales
i
have
had
perfect
for
the
daytime
and
perfect
for
avoiding
the
side
effects
of
stronger
beers
it
is
mighty
well
balanced
and
is
clean
and
crisp
it
has
flavors
and
body
of
a
stronger
beers
as
well
this
turns
out
to
be
a
very
flavorful
light
ale
loaded
nice
grain
and
malt
complexity
with
a
nice
low
abv
so
very
sessionable
a
nice
gentle
warming
delight
on
a
late
winter
early
evening

overall
this
accomplishes
its
goal
quite
well
a
fairly
tasty
beer
you
would
drink
down
by
the
river
and
be
able
to
drive
home
after
a
few
but
still
remains
tasty
this
is
also
definitely
a
beer
that
could
be
used
for
future
conversions
overall
a
light
relatively
flavorful
blonde
with
refreshing
qualities
not
especially
fond
of
blondes
but
this
one
may
be
the
occasional
buy
once
the
weather
turns
a
bit
warmer
summer
bbqs
here
this
comes
much
better
than
their
twilight
summer
offering
i
like
this
session
beer
and
ill
be
buying
more
as
there
are
literally
no
choices
for
low
abv
brews
other
than
beers
with
the
word
light
in
them
d
i
like
this
one
quite
a
bit
given
the
style
and
objective
its
a
success
i
wish
more
breweries
would
start
offering
quality
sessionable
beers
on
tap
at
an
irish
pub
in
park
city
of
all
places
apparently
a
low
abv
selection
made
for
the
states
with
funny
laws
i
was
impressed
with
this
though
it
pours
a
clear
sunny
color
with
an
inch
of
lasting
rich
fluff
on
top
the
nose
is
mellow
malt
light
and
crisp
crackery
with
a
honey
sweetness
meadow
springtime
feeling
beer
the
taste
matches
the
nose
crisp
and
clean
balanced
with
a
decent
bit
of
bittering
hops
coming
through
the
straw
malt
profile
very
very
drinkable
at
a
low
abv
fuller
bodied
too
for
its
color
which
i
like
a
lot
this
was
an
outstanding
beer
on
a
big
hangover
just
something
to
ease
the
headache
away
and
reestablish
myself
i
always
associate
deschutes
with
big
bold
beers
experimental
stuff
and
a
penchant
for
creativity
but
this
simple
everyday
drinker
is
also
something
to
behold
in
its
own
way
i
really
enjoyed
it
and
could
easily
drink
pint
after
pint
of
this
everything
a
lighter
beer
should
be
well
done
golden
clear
nice
solid
creamy
foam
smells
floral
some
grain
hint
of
hay
taste
is
a
little
bitter
a
little
corn
a
bit
of
herbal
hops
light
bodied
with
lower
carb
and
a
semi
dry
finish
meh
needs
a
little
more
oomph
if
you
ask
me
extremely
drinkable
and
more
than
enough
flavor
to
go
around
for
its
size
well
done
deschutes
o
enjoyable
brew
not
a
style
that
i
normally
frequent
but
a
nice
departure
at
the
time
of
writing
this
ive
never
had
another
blonde
ale
yet
but
the
description
on
this
site
of
blonde
ales
is
pretty
spoton
with
this
beer
in
terms
of
looks
it
reminds
me
of
a
pale
wheat
ale
and
looks
quite
nice
but
in
terms
of
taste
i
found
it
forgettable
if
i
think
of
this
as
a
lager
its
rather
nice
drank
way
better
than
i
thought
it
would
not
a
bad
example
of
the
style
i
was
concerned
that
the
beer
was
two
months
past
its
best
by
date
and
so
i
employed
a
very
gentle
pour
which
resulted
in
just
a
skim
of
wisps
in
lieu
of
head
no
problem
as
i
then
used
the
servers
trick
and
agitated
it
into
producing
a
finger
of
foamy
eggshellwhite
head
with
good
retention
color
was
a
deep
goldenyellow
srm
4

with
nequality
clarity
and
my
old
friends
mammon
croesus
and
midas
returned
for
a
taste
i
leaned
in
for
a
sniff
and
was
rewarded
with
an
odor
like
honeylemon
tea
no
joke
the
saaz
hops
interacted
really
well
with
the
belgian
malt
to
create
a
very
mellow
smell
i
have
been
fighting
a
bad
head
cold
of
late
and
this
seememed
like
just
what
the
doctor
ordered
my
first
draught
was
very
tealike
slightly
thin
on
the
tongue
in
terms
of
mouthfeel
but
very
much
like
drinking
honeylemon
tea
i
would
have
probably
identified
it
as
a
czech
pils
or
another
type
of
lager
had
they
not
identified
it
on
the
label
as
an
ale
finish
was
semidry
and
mellow
to
the
point
that
i
was
driven
to
have
a
bit
of
a
liedown
oh
my
overall
nothing
extraordinary
happening
in
this
brew
but
it
certainly
would
make
a
perfect
companion
on
a
warm
and
sunny
afternoon
pours
bright
sunny

light

taste

sweetness
with
a
mild

close

easy
going
sweet
tasty
honest
beer
great
midwest
farm
beer
overall
just
a
middle
of
the

ale
nothing
particularly
memorable
about
it
two

golden

3

pours
amber
touched
golden
with
a
strong
grain
presence
on
the
nose
flavor
brings
a
lot
of
the
same
one
dimensional
but
consistent
feel
is
okay
this
is
pretty
basic
no
real
flair
but
at
least
it
brings
a
more
hearty
character
than
most
of
the
others
in
its
style
one
and
done
oa
boring
but
easy
drinking
beer
try
it
and
then
forget
it
overall
pretty
much
a
glutenfree
kolsch
which
would
be
a
really
good
thing
if
the
mouthfeel
was
better
o
decent
glutenfree
offering
definitely
beerlike
and
not
ciderlike
which
is
my
main
complaint
with
most
gf
beers
m
fine
grained
well
carbonated
thick
enough
nice
overall
its
not
a
bland
blonde
ale
but
its
really
nothing
to
buy
again
another
great
beer
from
two
brothers
o
this
beer
is
easy
to
drink
and
is
a
good
representation
of
the
style
it
would
probably
make
for
a
good
summer
beer
or
a
pairing
with
a
meal
o
a
decent
ale
for
this
style
i
would
drink
more
than
one
in
a
sitting
i
highly
recommend
this
to
folks
who
are
used
to
drinking
nothing
but
mgdbud
this
beer
will
not
blow
you
away
i
think
a
great
positive
for
this
beer
is
it
being
gluten
free
this
makes
it
a
great
option
for
those
allergic
to
gluten
o
a
pretty
good
blonde
ale
i
think
the
hops
could
have
been
utilized
a
bit
better
in
the
flavor
profile
which
could
have
been
a
bit
stronger
in
general
but
still
tasty
and
refreshing
didnt
know
quite
what
to
expect
from
this
beer
but
being
a
fan
of
two
brothers
i
figured
it
was
worth
investigating
i
have
to
say
i
was
pretty
disappointed
pours
a
transparent
gold
color
with
a
meager
head
that
is
soon
gone
smell
is
faint
but
whats
there
is
not
all
that
appealing
flavor
leans
toward
the
hoppy
end
of
the
spectrum
with
a
wheat
aftertaste
reminiscent
of
bud
light
golden
wheat
to
be
honest
overall
a
pretty
thin
beer
with
little
working
for
it
in
any
regard
two
brothers
have
far
better
brews
than
this
pours
from
the
bottle
into
a
pint
glass
a
clear
bright
gold
color
a
fingers
worth
of
bright
white
head
quickly
settles
to
a
thin
cap
leaving
little
lacing
behind
smells
are
faint
but
i
can
detect
some
grain
bready
malts
spice
from
hops
and
light
sweet
fruits
the
taste
is
bigger
than
the
nose
all
of
the
above
blend
together
very
well
to
create
an
easy
drinking
light
tasting
beer
mouthfeel
is
kinda
thin
but
average
for
the
style
overall
this
would
probably
be
better
for
a
long
hot
summer
day
but
it
hit
the
spot
on
a
cold
winters
night
with
dinnner
just
as
well
plain
and
simple
this
is
a
nice
beer
smooth
feel
light
to
medium
body
floral
husky
grains
light
bready
sweetness
pepper
and
yeastiness
with
a
dry
clean
finish
simple
and
easy
drinking
though
its
often
overlooked
took
me
years
to
write
a
review
of
it
not
the
first
2
bros
beer
ill
usually
reach
for
but
wouldnt
turn
it
down
either
trying
the
prairie
path
ale
from
two
brothers
out
of
warrenville
il
the
appearance
is
clear
golden
color
with
very
thin
white
almost
nonexisitent
head
that
appears
to
be
trying
to
lace
the
smell
has
very
subtle
citrus
lemonny
notes
not
much
else
the
taste
is
a
little
bitter
due
to
the
citrus
twang
not
much
grain
or
malt
i
am
guessing
rye
is
used
to
give
the
beer
a
dryness
and
ability
to
clear
the
pallet
except
for
the
lemon
sourness
that
hangs
on
mouthfeel
is
ok
i
think
the
bitternesstartness
from
the
lingering
pallet
grasp
of
the
citrus
make
this
beer
a
bit
dodgy
overall
it
is
ok
whoever
added
this
beer
to
the
ba
has
classified
it
wrong
this
is
a
golden
ale
not
a
belgium
pale
ale
this
is
overall
a
very
enjoyable
drinkable
take
on
the
belgian
pale
ale
style
the
aroma
and
taste
are
to
be
recommended
though
neither
are
particularly
strong
another
two
brothers
beer
i
will
keep
my
eye
out
for
taste
is
toasty
with
a
wee
bit
of
citrus
and
hops
a
pleasant
and
drinkable
golden
ale
here
without
much
flash
or
overthetop
attitude
not
outstanding
but
solid
12zo
bottle
very
clear
and
copper
color
very
light
carbonation
and
head
thins
out
rapidly
suttle
aroma
of
citric
hops
and
light
lemon
taste
lingers
of
only
a
moment
and
then
discipates
very
light
and
crsip
beer
for
engoying
any
time
one
of
the
most
suttle
golden
ales
and
a
very
good
beer
while
this
is
very
good
and
i
would
recommend
trying
it
i
was
puzzeled
a
bit
as
to
why
it
is
listed
as
a
belgian
pale
ale
as
there
wasnt
much
belgian
yeast
flavor
to
it
at
all
solid
but
no
need
to
seek
out
overall
a
very
solid
beer
that
i
would
have
no
issues
with
trying
out
again
anyday
about
as
solid
as
they
come
figured
i
needed
a
beer
whilst
moseying
down
memory
lane
and
this
one
was
the
first
to
jump
outta
the
fridge
it
pours
a
clear
golden
straw
topped
by
a
finger
of
white
foam
the
nose
comprises
lemon
zest
light
black
pepper
a
pinch
of
what
seems
like
nutmeg
and
a
decidedly
light
bit
o
caramel
the
taste
follows
pretty
closely
though
the
pepper
comes
through
a
bit
more
and
some
lemongrass
joins
the
party
as
well
the
body
is
a
light
medium
with
a
moderate
carbonation
and
a
fairly
dry
finish
overall
a
pretty
nice
brew
nothing
overtly
special
but
i
could
easily
see
downing
several
of
these
if
given
the
opportunity
o
decent
if
not
memorable
average
beer
another
top
notch
beer
from
two
brothers
as
far
as
i
am
concerned
very
enjoyable
and
highly
recommended
drinkability
although
not
the
time
of
year
for
it
now
i
could
see
myself
having
a
few
of
these
on
a
hot
summer
day
out
at
a
bbq
there
is
just
a
little
more
going
on
here
than
312
the
light
ale
i
normally
find
at
such
gatherings
delicate
but
not
one
of
the
more
enjoyable
beers
i
have
had
from
two
brothers
this
is
my
2nd
favorite
beligian
pale
ale
only
troubadour
is
better
for
me
and
this
is
much
less
expensive
and
locally
brewed
drinkability
nice
look
smell
and
taste
a
refreshing
beer
especially
with
fish
i
like
the
clarity
of
prairie
path
its
bouquet
of
grassy
herbal
floral
tones
never
come
across
as
muddled
or
musty
though
not
my
usual
choice
but
i
wouldnt
mind
having
this
one
again
avoid
this
d
good
ale
not
anything
that
begs
back
for
more
very
typical
but
well
done
though
the
taste
isnt
all
that
impressive
it
finishes
very
clean
and
coupled
with
its
dry
mouthfeel
high
carbonation
and
moderate
weightits
fairly
drinkable
as
a
summer
afternoon
beer
d
i
could
take
down
a
6pack
no
problem
i
would
continue
to
purchase
this
if
there
is
nothing
new
i
havent
tried
at
my
local
beer
store
drinkability
very
drinkable
brew
perhaps
too
drinkable
or
i
was
really
thirsty
not
sure
which
this
beer
was
gone
before
i
knew
it
definitely
a
thirst
quencher
more
than
a
sipping
beer
wouldnt
seek
out
again
but
wouldnt
turn
one
down
medium
body
with
a
light
carbination
could
drink
these
as
long
as
youd
care
to
d
this
beer
is
drinkable
but
boring
reminds
me
more
of
a
pale
lager
than
a
belgian
pale
overall
it
is
palatable
just
very
lacking
in
character
all
in
all
quite
drinkable
appearance
and
smell
suggested
that
this
might
be
thin
and
light
but
that
just
set
up
the
taste
which
was
full
with
a
lot
of
honey
and
the
mouthfeel
which
was
again
full
but
very
smooth
all
in
all
a
very
enjoyable
beer
and
one
you
could
go
back
to
again
and
again
d
this
is
a
good
tasting
beer
although
it
doesnt
seem
like
a
belgian
pale
ale
still
it
would
make
a
solid
session
brew
not
my
favorite
offering
from
two
brothers
nor
my
favorite
style
of
beer
but
worthy
of
a
try
yourself
this
is
my
first
but
certainly
not
my
last
two
brothers
offering
this
first
four
of
the
six
pack
poured
a
head
that
topped
a
samuel
smith
pint
glass
so
i
took
it
easy
on
this
one
and
the
head
was
minimal
but
still
nice
looking
for
the
style
kinda
an
average
beer
here
on
ba
but
i
really
dig
this
beer
paired
with
a
frozen
pizza
just
out
of
the
oven
and
it
pairs
well
smell
is
on
par
for
the
style
but
taste
and
mouthfeel
are
above
average
and
drinkability
well
i
could
drink
several
of
these
in
one
sitting
nice
job
two
brothers
i
am
really
not
sure
to
what
degree
this
is
belgian
little
corresponding
aromajust
pils
malts
and
some
floral
hop
the
brewery
website
cites
the
usage
of
belgian
malts
but
im
not
sure
belgian
malts
do
a
belgian
beer
make
the
label
says
golden
ale
and
i
reckon
its
actually
a
pretty
fair
example
of
that
style
light
but
present
and
nice
enough
malt
character
good
hop
contributions
well
call
it
a
golden
ale
a
pleasant
surprise
a
12
ounce
bottle
picked
up
at
the
beer
stop
for
around
1
75
poured
into
a
nonic
pint
glass
the
ale
appears
a
clear
golden
yellow
color
with
about
an
inch
of
foamy
bone
white
head
nose
and
flavor
are
of
spicy
yeast
pepper
toasted
bread
lemon
apricot
sweet
malt
a
notch
better
than
medium
in
both
body
and
carbonation
tasty
and
accessible
d
this
was
okay
but
nothing
to
memorable
i
wouldnt
have
called
this
a
belgian
anything
if
i
had
tasted
it
blind
reviewed
on
07312009
on
tap
at
blind
tiger
this
beer
pours
a
clear
orange
with
a
small
head
the
aroma
is
of
fruit
and
bready
yeast
the
flavor
is
of
bread
yeast
sweet
fruits
it
is
very
pleasant
drinking
and
definitely
underrated
on
this
site
overall
a
drinkable
beer
mediumlightbodied
mouthfeel
with
low
carbonation
fairly
easy
to
drink
but
this
bpa
needs
some
work
d
i
liked
this
beer
overall
the
flavor
is
fairly
complex
and
the
low
abv
makes
it
easy
to
imbibe
d
easy
enough
to
drink
a
couple
of
and
something
that
bmc
fans
could
probably
appreciate
when
i
first
had
this
beer
before
ba
i
remember
liking
it
a
lot
more
mouthfeel
is
good
for
the
styleand
its
easy
to
drink
howeverits
just
not
that
impressive
in
my
opinion
maybe
i
got
a
bad
bottlebut
kinda
middle
of
the
road
two
brothers
has
done
much
better
overall
i
think
this
is
a
quality
brew
my
lovely
wife
was
kind
enough
to
bring
this
back
to
me
during
one
of
her
recent
trips
down
to
the
chicago
area
im
always
open
to
gifts
i
can
drink
i
suggest
this
beer
be
on
your
hit
list
d
fantastic
balance
and
good
all
around
this
beer
is
an
easy
drinker
and
something
id
take
part
in
any
time
i
could
good
summer
beer
or
sessioner
drinkability
good
session
beer
crisp
and
refreshing
a
noble
attempt
at
the
belgian
pale
ale
style
by
two
brothers
its
a
beer
that
goes
down
nicely
yet
rewards
savoring
as
well
probably
wont
set
the
world
afire
but
a
good
choice
if
youre
in
illinois

a
hazy
golden
yellow
color

and
one
half
inch

of
an
offwhite
color
great
retention
and
great
lacing
smells
of
hops
sweet
malt
lemon
aroma
some
yeast
cleanliness
and
some
wheat
fits
the
style
of
a
belgian
pale
ale
mouth
feel
is
smooth
a
crisp
with
a
high
carbonation
level
tastes
of
hops
and
lemon
up
front
a
sweet
malt
background
and
a
hint
of
spice
all
spice
maybe
a
smooth
finish
overall
and
not
a
bad
brew
the
lighter
palate
of
this
beer
makes
it
a
great
summer
session
brew
i
must
say
that
im
rating
this
brew
a
bit
higher
than
the
average
and
im
not
sure
as
to
why
there
is
such
a
low
average
rating
probably
the
best
lemon
beer
ive
ever
had
a
drier
take
on
the
style
i
would
like
this
a
little
more
it
if
it
were
a
little
sweeter
im
going
to
keep
trying
two
brothers
so
far
no
knockouts
though
d
big
drinkabilty
here
screw
budlights
drinkability
this
is
it
this
is
my
idea
of
a
damned
near
perfect
session
beer
somethnig
i
can
sit
down
with
and
either
relax
with
or
get
a
snoot
full
of
im
not
a
hophead
but
there
is
enough
hops
in
here
to
make
me
happy
enough
at
least
for
a
change
of
pace
from
my
normal
diet
of
maltbombs
im
digging
this
beer
and
really
digging
this
brewery
these
guys
are
cranking
out
some
great
beers
second
only
to
new
glarus
as
my
favorite
brewery
and
not
by
much
there
are
better
golden
ales
out
there
wasnt
impressed
with
this
a
decent
lightbodied
golden
ale
with
a
mellow
spicy
hop
character
that
seems
to
come
from
noble
hops
like
saaz
pours
clear
and
blond
with
a
firm
head
that
settles
to
slight
ring
of
bubbles
no
lace
somewhat
like
a
kolsch
but
a
touch
darker
in
color
and
with
a
more
toasted
character
just
enough
bitterness
and
crisp
toasted
malt
character
to
get
this
one
from
getting
boring
very
clean
and
almost
lagerlike
get
this
one
fresh
and
its
a
delicious
session
beer
not
sure
this
has
the
esters
to
be
considered
a
belgian
ale
more
of
blonde
but
thats
quite
alright
i
found
the
ale
a
bit
thick
on
the
tongue
like
a
flat
cola
it
wasnt
something
to
savor
and
squeeze
in
the
mouth
but
the
ease
of
drinking
with
the
clean
finish
it
makes
this
a
beer
i
would
drink
again
and
again
mouthfeel
is
carbonated
and
also
slightly
creamy
and
there
is
a
clean
finish
as
i
swallow
overall
a
decent
beer
and
one
that
i
would
have
again
there
was
just
something
weird
about
this
beer
that
i
cannot
place
right
now
for
this
style
im
going
for
the
orval
trappist
ale
poured
from
the
bottle
into
a
pint
glass
beer
is
a
slightly
hazy
yellowgolden
color
with
a
thin
cap
of
creamy
looking
head
the
smell
is
sweet
slightly
fruity
a
little
grainy
and
spicy
the
taste
reveals
some
of
the
same
sweetness
pretty
well
bitter
but
not
hoppy
there
might
be
a
bit
of
skunk
to
this
bottle
although
its
expo
is
102108
the
mouthfeel
is
light
in
body
with
a
creamy
carbonation
and
a
very
dry
finish
overall
this
beer
is
decent
probably
better
than
your
average
bmc
beer
but
nothing
spectacular
i
would
not
make
a
point
to
seek
this
one
out
again
d
its
a
very
drinkable
brew
but
a
little
weak
on
the
flavor
for
me
rich
golden
color
poured
from
the
bottle
pencil
thin
head
lasted
the
entire
duration
with
good
lacing
good
strong
hop
aroma
is
present
here
the
mouthfeel
was
slightly
bitter
which
accented
the
hoppy
aroma
overall
flavor
is
very
good
and
rather
complex
for
a
golden
ale
this
one
is
bursting
with
flavor
very
enjoyable
and
highly
recommended
received
as
an
extra

but
not

consistent
in
my
opinion
i
was
hoping
for
a
bit
more
from
this
one
as
i
have
lived
just
off
of
said
prairie
path
for
many
a
year
while
it
is
not
really
a
belgian
pale
ale
it
is
still
a
good
beer
i
will
definitely
grab
some
for
my
next
midnight
session
on
the
path
dark
golden
color
with
a
fine
bubbly
head
fair
amount
of
lacing
left
behind
crisp
clean
smell
reminds
me
of
spring
day
boy
does
that
sound
stupid
mostly
light
malts
with
a
faint
grassy
hop
note
taste
is
light
malt
with
some
cereal
like
flavors
to
it
again
some
faint
grassy
hop
in
the
finish
mouth
is
a
little
thin
overall
another
quality
brew
from
two
brothers
i
would
recomend
trying
all
of
their
brews
that
ive
sampled
so
far
and
this
one
is
no
different
pours
a
medium
to
dark
gold
with
a
medium
lived
small
white
head
smell
is
nice
anc
clean
grassy
hops
which
are
subtle
but
nice
and
fresh
taste
is
light
and
clean
malt
with
crisp
grassy
and
lightly
bittering
hops
smooth
flavorful
and
easy
drinking
medium
to
thin
bodied
with
moderate
carbonation
i
enjoyed
this
one
for
sure
despite
its
relative
simplicity
nothing
special
here
certainly
not
as
bold
as
other
american
blondes
glad
i
didnt
pay
for
it
fair
carbonation
mid
body
good
beer
these
guys
do
a
pretty
good
job
brewing
interesting
styles
for
the
midwest
i
could
drink
this
again
need
to
visit
the
brewery
a
nice
easy
drinker
but
nothing
great
d
very
good
drinkability
this
seems
more
like
a
toasty
pilsner
than
a
bpa
quite
refreshing
pours
golden
amber
with
some
good
bubbling
spradic
lacing
and
a
ring
foam
the
first
whiff
whether
cold
or
warm
is
sweet
butter
as
it
warms
the
buttery
malts
simmer
down
just
a
tad
then
a
few
other
drier
grains
come
up
in
the
tail
end
of
each
end
the
taste
is
equally
buttery
but
with
some
hard
water
taste
in
the
middle
with
a
light
bitterness
at
the
finish
the
palate
is
a
little
toasty
sweet
and
dry
this
beer
pours
a
hazy
golden
color
two
finger
white
head
with
some
nice
lacing
throughout
the
drink
its
nose
isnt
very
strong
but
i
notice
a
hint
of
sweetness
behind
a
faint
lemon
scent
this
beer
has
a
smooth
mild
taste
a
little
spice
a
touch
of
citrus
and
mild
yeasty
flavor
i
think
the
mouthfeel
is
great
good
carbonation
smooth
going
down
this
beer
is
very
drinkable
and
would
pair
great
with
pizza
awesome
for
a
small
brewery
outside
of
chicago
i
plan
to
try
more
from
two
brothers
pours
a
light
orange
color
with
a
smallish
head
smell
is
kinda
citrusy
with
a
light
hop
presence
taste
is
first
a
bit
bitter
then
a
more
smooth
taste
it
is
not
bad
could
have
a
bit
more
body
to
it
the
mouthfeel
is
kinda
watery
this
kinda
tastes
like
a
mixture
of
hefeweizen
and
a
pale
ale
its
interesting
fairly
hard
pour
made
just
a
wee
bee
ivory
head
but
on
a
clear
and
crisp
golden
ale
just
full
of
sparkling
carbonation
head
did
have
some
staying
power
aroma
is
more
along
a
standard
pilsner
than
anything
belgium
quaff
is
the
same
almost
more
english
bitter
than
anything
else
woody
resinous
and
dry
in
the
finish
surprised
by
the
averageness
of
this
brew
nothing
unique
or
special
with
it
not
a
bad
tasting
brew
but
not
one
to
come
back
for
again
clear
pale
gold
with
not
much
headlacing
understated
nosesome
vague
fruitiness
sweet
malt
and
an
grassyvegetal
aroma
lightly
sweet
malts
upfront
and
a
light
but
noticeable
bitterness
just
over
light
bodied
with
appropriate
carbonation
maybe
a
good
beginners
or
lawnmower
craft
beer
what
can
i
say
it
tasted
a
lot
better
when
sharing
it
with
my
dad
and
thinking
of
old
memories
so
i
will
buy
this
brew
again
but
purely
for
sentimental
reasons
not
a
bad
brew
and
like
i
said
would
be
great
for
an
outdoor
excursion
with
a
cooler
of
ice
a
grill
full
of
meat
and
a
hot
sun
would
compliment
a
burger
perfectly
carbonation
is
overdone
a
real
surprise
given
the
lack
of
a
longlasting
head
however
as
i
continue
to
drink
the
beer
my
enjoyment
never
wanes
a
flawed
but
highly
drinkable
brew
one
i
would
have
no
trouble
ordering
in
the
future
the
beer
pours
a
hazy
gold
color
with
a
thin
white
head
that
fades
to
spotty
lacing
the
aroma
is
good
it
has
a
nice
pale
and
munich
malt
scent
along
with
a
light
hop
aroma
it
seems
quite
malty
very
nice
the
taste
is
decent
it
has
a
smokey
malt
flavor
that
boasts
of
pale
munich
and
rauch
malts
the
belgian
yeast
doesnt
seem
to
be
present
in
the
taste
it
goes
down
smooth
and
finishes
with
a
dry
goldings
hop
flavor
the
mouthfeel
is
decent
also
it
is
a
medium
bodied
beer
with
less
than
adequate
carbonation
this
is
a
forgettable
beer
the
appearance
suffers
no
head
retention
the
taste
is
smokey
for
some
reason
and
the
co2
is
less
than
desirable
its
one
and
done
for
me
mouthfeel
is
medium
bodied
and
pretty
smooth
and
the
drinkability
is
pretty
decent
as
theres
nothing
to
really
make
this
one
hard
to
put
down
flavor
wise
other
than
the
lack
there
of
d
tasty
goes
down
easy
just
a
little
bit
filling
may
not
be
quite
ontarget
for
the
style
but
still
a
pretty
good
beer
i
could
drink
a
few
of
them
but
might
look
for
something
a
little
more
flavorful
after
that
pours
a
golden
lemon
with
a
nic
epillow
head
and
good
lacing
mainly
malt
some
hop
notes
smells
a
bit
lagery
smooth
creamy
malty
on
the
front
hops
kick
in
a
midpalate
metallic
and
bitter
on
the
finish
mouthfeel
is
creamy
but
has
an
unplasant
matallic
finish
because
of
teh
metallic
finish
drinkability
suffers
the
mouth
is
soft
with
a
bit
slickness
this
is
a
very
easy
drinker
but
its
not
really
tasty
enough
to
session
i
like
it
but
i
wont
be
buying
kegs
of
it
again
ill
stick
to
the
occasional
six
pack
from
here
out
d
very
drinkable
indeed
what
it
lacks
in
strength
and
complexity
it
makes
up
for
in
its
muted
gentle
flavor
and
aroma
seems
to
be
more
of
a
pale
ale
than
a
belgian
though
as
it
doesnt
seem
outrageous
or
assertive
enough
to
be
compared
to
the
likes
of
duvel
and
orval
drinkability
is
a
ok
quite
a
nice
refreshing
brew
this
would
be
a
tremendous
pick
to
keep
on
hand
for
those
timid
bmc
drinker
that
just
need
to
get
their
feet
a
little
wet
to
start
prosit
mk
drinkability
this
is
decent
and
could
be
sessionable
this
poured
a
slightly
hazy
orange
yellow
color
with
no
head
the
carbonation
was
light
to
moderate
the
aroma
was
sweet
and
malty
the
hops
greet
you
in
a
similar
way
as
a
pils
would
there
is
some
floral
taste
to
it
refreshing
but
almost
dry
this
is
a
very
flavorful
golden
brew
there
is
the
slightest
hint
of
euro
smelltaste
to
it
the
mouthfeel
is
dry
and
slick
overall
this
is
very
refreshing
but
complex
as
the
label
states
looks
simple
but
tastes
complex
i
suggest
drinking
this
not
too
cold
to
bring
out
the
flavors
poured
into
an
imperial
pint
glass
formed
a
12
white
head
over
the
clear
light
golden
brew
head
fades
pretty
quickly
down
an
uneven
layer
of
bubbles
although
with
lots
of
white
lacing
aroma
is
minimal
some
pale
malt
and
effervescence
taste
is
light
pale
sweetness
countered
and
overcome
by
rounded
bitterness
that
dominates
the
rest
on
through
the
aftertaste
mouthfeel
is
soft
over
the
tongue
although
the
bitter
is
more
dominating
thatn
i
would
want
and
drinkability
is
acceptable
nothing
much
i
would
strive
to
revisit
here
orange
well
orchestated
aroma
of
butter
toffee
burnt
corn
peaches
spicy
and
grassy
hops
along
with
some
grainy
and
cereal
like
malts
this
tastes
like
a
prairie
dry
grainy
husky
malts
put
forth
notes
of
caramel
medicine
and
light
fruit
the
hops
shine
through
the
most
here
they
are
herbal
grassy
quite
spicy
and
not
a
pleasing
combo
for
me
anyway
not
offensive
m
d
mouthfeel
and
drinkability
are
ok
on
this
offering
from
two
brothers
very
light
tasting
and
easy
drinking
beer
thats
refreshing
and
goes
down
smoothly
seems
like
a
very
good
summer
beer
as
you
are
sweating
on
the
beach
i
would
have
another
one
of
these
if
it
was
offered
to
me
but
not
sure
if
i
would
go
out
and
buy
six
pack
unless
there
wasnt
a
better
alternative
easy
drinking
smooth
not
one
i
would
go
out
of
way
to
get
but
i
certainly
would
not
pass
one
up
overall
middle
of
the
road
humble
as
prarie
path
may
be
it
would
make
a
fine
session
beer
notes
growing
up
i
lived
just
a
block
away
from
the
prairie
path
this
ale
refers
to
like
other
reviewers
from
the
area
drinking
this
brew
always
brings
back
fond
memories
from
my
childhood
i
could
get
to
the
wayne
county
store
in
20
minutes
flat
by
bike
from
my
house
mouthfeel
is
rather
light
with
a
bit
of
creaminess
and
a
good
flow
of
carbonation
extremely
easy
to
drink
this
one
my
fiance
has
started
drinking
this
over
miller
lite
which
i
applaud
i
could
see
having
a
few
on
a
hot
day
but
other
than
that
this
one
leaves
me
searching
for
something
more
opinion
well
its
not
a
bad
beer
it
is
too
one
dimensional
for
my
taste
and
is
very
lacking
for
an
apa
it
is
definitely
more
of
a
blonde
ale
i
probably
wont
be
seeking
this
out
drinkable
but
boring
not
what
i
would
expect
for
the
style
nice
session
beer
but
no
real
flavor
this
is
a
very
raw
beer
in
that
the
smell
and
taste
is
reminiscent
of
unfermented
malts
smells
like
my
mash
tun
really
its
not
overpowering
though
looks
nice
in
the
glass
hazy
golden
color
hops
alphas
only
not
too
floral
just
bitterness
ive
really
not
been
too
impressed
with
two
brothers
and
this
is
no
exception
beer
is
good
happy
beering
prairie
path
golden
ale
is
a
hodgepodge
of
a
beer
that
doesnt
quite
come
together
to
form
a
unified
whole
having
said
that
i
felt
much
more
kindly
toward
it
by
the
tenth
ounce
or
so
although
i
wont
be
looking
for
another
bottle
anytime
soon
im
not
sorry
that
i
gave
it
a
home
clear
amber
gold
with
a
slight
tawny
highlight
the
color
is
a
little
deeper
than
insipid
that
might
not
sound
like
much
of
a
compliment
but
it
is
a
lovely
color
the
head
didnt
form
that
impressively
at
the
apex
the
foam
was
still
less
than
one
finger
in
height
and
it
quickly
faded
to
a
soapy
cap
this
aspect
of
the
beer
is
not
impressive
there
was
no
subsequent
lacing
aside
from
a
speckle
or
two
it
is
uninspiring
to
look
at
the
nose
is
buttery
with
a
kiss
of
popcorn
floral
hops
at
the
back
some
herbal
spiciness
disinterested
malts
the
nose
doesnt
explain
anything
to
me
the
label
says
golden
ale
ba
says
apa
rb
says
a
belgian
ale
wtf
does
that
mean
two
brothers
website
says
prairie
path
ale
is
a

golden

prairie

and

the
belgian

with

give
this
beer
great
drinkability

is
this
suppose
to
be
like
duvel
they
cant
be
serious
to
me
this
beer
smells
more
like
an
english
pale
ale
whatever
it
is
i
dont
find
the
aroma
inviting
the
first
sip
is
boring
the
second
sip
is
buttered
popcorn
the
third
sip
is
heavy
with
the
residue
of
the
second
sip
but
some
new
flavors
emerge
like
weak
bitterness
and
some
flowery
vibes
two
brothers
thinks
this
beer
is
belgian
in
nature
you
got
to
be
kidding
me
first
of
all
it
is
way
to
clean
it
is
also
too
english
and
too
damn
simplistic
for
me
to
care
where
are
the
saaz
and
goldings
hops
they
are
not
offering
any
bitterness
of
note
and
little
in
the
way
of
flavor
either
my
definition
of
golden
ale
is
wrong
or
this
beer
is
just
off
i
really
dont
understand
what
is
going
on
lets
say
for
the
sake
of
argument
i
completely
ignore
style
guidelines
and
just
go
by
taste
this
beer
doesnt
taste
good
i
dont
care
for
it
boring
with
too
significant
flavors
of
popcorn
blah
mediumlight
in
body
watery
on
the
tongue
the
carbonation
is
low
and
this
only
hurts
the
situation
this
beer
is
not
drinkable
or
enjoyable
or
anything
id
suggest
you
try
it
will
take
some
serious
convincing
to
get
me
to
try
this
beer
again
i
purchased
this
bottle
in
iowa
city
ia
not
good
layer
of
crisp
citrus
orange
and
lime
chewy
grains
flash
roasted
a
great
gulper
i
finished
that
bottle
in
30
seconds
or
so
quaf
quaf
it
would
go
great
with
duck
or
goose
and
roasted
roots
and
tubers
and
green
beans
and
almonds
the
beer
is
a
clear
golden
color
with
a
frothy
noteworthy
head
moderate
lace
the
nose
is
grassy
and
fruity
with
a
substantial
citrus
character
light
body
and
fairly
high
carbonation
a
little
acidic
trait
in
the
brew
as
well
not
really
a
lot
of
sweetness
in
this
one
but
there
is
a
solid
sharp
bitter
finish
i
see
this
one
as
a
great
refreshing
summer
sipping
beer
drinkability
for
a
cookout
id
say
5
it
is
good
for
the
summer
when
you
want
something
refreshing
for
winter
id
want
a
little
fuller
body
something
to
keep
me
warm
id
buy
it
again
prairie
path
pours
a
crystal
clear
golden
body
beneath
an
averagesized
head
of
bright
white
foam
the
head
retention
is
quite
good
and
it
leaves
some
very
nice
lace
at
the
outset
of
the
glass
the
nose
delivers
a
combination
of
yeast
fruitiness
floral
and
grassy
hops
and
lightly
grainy
and
perhaps
subtly
toasty
malt
the
body
is
mediumlight
and
its
crisp
carbonation
tingles
the
palate
the
flavor
is
as
might
be
expected
based
on
the
nose
with
a
bit
more
graininess
to
the
malt
and
more
floral
herbal
and
spicy
hops
than
are
already
suggested
its
anchored
by
a
firm
bitterness
and
what
sweet
malt
is
there
at
the
start
fades
to
a
dry
finish
that
lingers
with
some
swirling
hop
flavors
floral
spicy
grassy
its
an
interesting
and
refreshing
beer
but
it
still
remains
fairly
basic
in
character
overall
still
its
a
nice
summer
beer
to
enjoy
at
the
end
of
a
long
day
as
the
sun
goes
down

poured
with
a
malty
golden
color
and
nice

aroma
was
of
light
to
medium
hop
but
the
conditions
for
smelling
were
not
decent
hops
were
adequate
in
the
taste
but
not
overpowering
hops
were
balanced
but
mild
there
was
minimal
malt
feel
had
a
very
waterdowned
overall
characteristic
overall
nice
bier
for
a
session
drink
just
would
benifit
from
more
malt
or
grains
its
gold
and
a
bit
hazy
the
head
is
ample
but
doesnt
last
very
long
the
malts
are
in
the
aroma
with
a
slight
bready
smell
a
bit
of
hops
in
the
aroma
too
but
nothing
special
a
solid
swigger
here
easy
to
drink
pleasantly
mild
on
the
palate
perfect
carbonation
level
bready
malts
make
up
most
of
the
mild
flavor
and
hops
finish
it
off
once
again
mildly
this
beer
doesnt
quite
tickle
my
fancy
but
its
worth
a
try
how
does
this
pour
such
a
huge
head
i
poured
about
23
of
it
in
a
pint
glass
and
there
is
about
2
inches
of
head
its
a
hazy
orangegold
color
with
lots
of
visible
carbonation
smell
is
not
very
strong
light
malt
and
hops
not
a
very
interesting
taste
the
malt
is
very
weak
the
hops
do
go
well
with
the
carbonation
level
though
not
terribly
impressive
not
bad
though
poured
a
slightly
hazy
golden
straw
with
no
much
head
to
speak
of
aroma
was
sweet
with
cottoncandy
and
vague
fruit
flavor
continued
to
favor
the
sweeter
side
with
some
indistinct
fruit
and
sugarygrain
hopping
was
barely
enough
to
balance
not
a
bad
beer
but
not
a
lot
to
commend
this
beer
either
this
beer
poured
a
quickly
diminishing
small
white
head
with
fine
sized
bubbles
the
body
was
clear
and
the
hue
was
golden
the
nose
was
on
the
weak
side
but
i
did
detect
some
malt
and
hops
the
flavor
was
fruity
tasting
and
the
mouthfeel
was
tingly
and
smooth
there
was
very
little
lacing
with
this
beer
all
and
all
a
pretty
simple
brew
yet
fairly
likeable
and
easy
to
drink
the
beer
pours
a
pale
golden
with
orange
hues
the
head
is
minimal
the
palate
is
refreshing
and
clean
with
ample
balance
between
hop
and
malt
not
a
bad
pounder
id
be
interested
to
try
this
on
tap
on
a
hot
sumer

in

two
brothers
beers
are
all
over
the
map
to
me
this
one
is
a
keeper
as
a
warm

refresher
beyond
the
sea
of
hefes
not
a
big
beer
but
excelling
in
the

a

light
golden
color
with

not
a
very

but
what
is
present
is

the

not
in

the

in

with

a
lot
like

golden
ale
suffices
as
is
but
a
few
more
handfuls
of
chops
would
provide
it
with
more
of
the
piercingly
independent
spirit
it
boasts
of
it
is
a
simple
ale
wellsuited
to
the
hot
texas
climate
to
be
sure
however
the
lone
star
state
has
enough
new
craft
breweries
that
residents
should
probably
forget
about
the
alamo
and
move
to
greener
pastures
not
much
to
stir
the
imagination
here
i
guess
i
have
to
admit
this
is
quite
drinkable
but
its
no
better
than
the
average
blonde
from
the
12
oz
bottle
bought
at
texas
wine
cellars
in
fredericksburg
tx
overall
a
nice
beer
to
drink
outside
on
a
nice
warm
day
id
drink
a
couple
light
mouthfeel
and
very
easy
to
drink
very
solid
overall
and
could
definitely
see
this
being
a
regular
in
my
fridge
if
available
to
me
not
a
bad
beer
for
alamo
its
weird
the
label
says
this
is
a
real
ale
beer
possibly
alamo
is
an
off
shoot
would
like
to
see
more
outta
these
guys
always
willing
to
give
the
texas
breweries
my
business
my
biggest
issue
is
that
a
beer
this
easy
to
drink
should
be
canned
so
you
can
take
it
to
the
lake
and
on
your
fishin
boat
its
pretty
tasty
stuff
i
just
made
a
blonde
ale
that
i
am
hoping
comes
out
this
light
and
tasty
and
easy
to
drink
overall
impression
as
i
said
above
do
not
drink
this
ice
cold
or
you
will
be
sorely
disappointed
this
needs
to
warm
up
a
bit
to
fully
come
alive
and
deliver
to
you
a
very
solid
golden
ale
that
may
not
offer
you
a
lot
of
surprises
it
definitely
gets
the
job
done
and
does
it
well
overall
impression
a
very
pleasant
golden
ale
that
still
had
character
and
a
nice
taste
to
keep
this
above
average
thanks
for
the
share
laura
i
have
seen
this
bottle
several
times
before
buying
one
as
a
part
of
a
mix
and
match
your
own
sixpack
this
was
the
only
of
the
six
that
was
not
an
ipa
and
that
was
because
coming
from
san
antonio
i
have
an
affinity
for
the
alamo
and
texas
in
general
five
of
the
six
were
texas
brews
i
struggled
to
figure
out
where
in
the
world
this
beer
came
from
the
label
indicated
it
is
a
product
of
real
ale
brewing
in
blanco
bu
the
website
is
a
completely
different
company
so
obviously
real
ale
must
be
contract
brewing
for
them
while
they
build
up
the
brand
i
am
a
huge
real
ale
fan
and
consider
firemans
four
smash
brew
or
not
the
best
lawnmower
beer
around
since
i
am
firmly
in
camp
with
real
ale
i
cannot
falt
their
technique
and
must
fault
the
recipe
for
what
turned
out
to
be
a
dissapointing
experience
the
brew
is
crystal
clear
and
pours
with
a
slight
head
if
agitated
which
leaves
light
lacing
but
the
hop
profile
is
almost
nonexistant
and
reminded
me
of
a
bmc
rather
than
blond
ale
like
firemans
four
the
malt
is
strangely
out
in
front
and
does
not
seem
well
balanced
with
any
bittering
hops
i
could
distinguish
i
prefer
a
blond
ale
with
a
light
malt
body
that
is
subtle
and
there
mostly
to
support
about
25
ibus
but
this
seems
closer
to
5
or
6
overall
an
okay
drinker
overall
not
a
bad
beer
if
you
dont
mind
a
smooth
but
salty
beer
i
hesitate
to
say
it
was
bitter
it
really
wasnt
and
the
bitterness
was
felt
mostly
in
the
aftertaste
all
in
all
a
beer
you
would
expect
out
of
texas
but
im
texan
so
im
biased
this
beer
is
a
nice
change
of
pace
from
the
heavier
abby
ales
stouts
ipas
and
other
meal
beers
it
is
what
the
american
mainstream
beers
should
be
light
yet
flavorful
its
honeysuckle
nose
light
sweet
taste
and
low
alcohol
content
are
perfect
for
those
times
when
youre
ready
for
a
brew
but
not
a
buzz
the
only
fault
i
find
is
its
slight
over
carbonation
this
isalthough
it
pains
me
to
say
itan
utterly
forgettable
golden
ale
why
does
it
pain
me
because
its
a
local
microbrew
and
i
wanna
give
some
love
to
the
home
team
it
is
not
the
same
recipe
as
real
ales

until
they

orange
and
some
pepper
spice
getting
just
a
small
amount
of
bitter
hops
in
there
as
well
just
like
the
taste
sweet
upfront
with
a
bitter
middle
that
sort
of
even
out
towards
the
finish
all
previous
characters
are
still
present
the
mouth
feel
is
very
refreshing
just
under
medium
bodied
with
crisp
carbonation
not
bad
at
all
this
one
is
a
bit
above
average
a
good
drinking
beer
great
for
summer
weather
no
doubt
blonde
tilting
toward
amber
moderate
malt
aspect
with
some
mildly
sweet
grain
notes
closely
followed
by
an
equally
moderate
hops
presence
not
a
bad
representation
of
the
style
although
a
tad
less
smooth
than
the
frontrunners
in
the
category
and
fell
a
little
short
of
what
i
would
want
in
a
session
ale
finally
a
beer
that
stands
out
among
most
texas
beers
a
little
strongly
hopped
but
not
too
much
i
especially
liked
the
alamo
name
king
of
the
hill
i
think
hank
hill
would
enjoy
this
one
hypothetically
speaking
boy
i
tell
you
what
this
is
a
great
starter
beer
in
the
ale
category
thats
probably
why
it
can
cause
some
confusion
for
folks
who
dont
care
too
much
for
a
strong
finish
this
is
good
i
would
say
its
in
the
middle
overall
its
a
great
texas
beer
i
would
definitely
recommend
it
to
beer
novices
looking
to
take
a
step
up
now
for
the
part
that
matters
taste
its
very
delicious
for
a
blonde
ale
its
yeastier
than
id
normally
like
but
its
pleasant
somehow
its
a
pleasantly
fruity
yeastiness
that
is
well
balanced
by
the
hops
and
the
taste
is
fresh
as
well
all
around
great
stuff
not
my
favourite
style
but
if
im
going
to
drink
a
blonde
this
is
going
to
be
it
sure
beats
shiners
i
like
this
beer
a
lot
its
got
a
good
deal
of
flavor
but
its
surprisingly
refreshing
exceptionally
well
balanced
o
exceeded
my
expectations
atmosphere
is
pretty
solid
nice
color
and
a
substantial
head
which
lingers
and
some
nice
lacing
nose
is
a
very
stout
grainy
tone
with
some
pepper
and
citrus
flavor
also
very
grainy
fresh
baked
bread
with
hints
of
the
sweet
citrus
and
a
bit
of
bitterness
to
balance
it
out
overall
this
is
a
pretty
good
quaff
very
average
at
best
i
think
that
is
pretty
much
the
point
of
this
beer
though
even
so
not
a
lot
going
on
to
keep
me
interested
taste
is
grainy
and
fresh
with
a
light
hint
of
fruity
yeast
biscuity
and
there
is
still
a
hint
of
pecan
nuttiness
hops
are
a
noshow
on
the
palate
not
bad
by
any
means
but
totally
and
utterly
forgettable
it
is
just
slightly
above
average
for
a
blonde
ale
the
fresh
grainy
malt
flavors
are
the
saving
grace
here
opinion
this
is
a
pretty
decent
beer
i
am
not
a
big
fan
of
their
hopbill
but
that
is
just
personal
preference
overall
the
balance
is
pretty
good
and
it
is
a
pretty
well
made
beer
without
any
fermentation
flaws
or
anything
this
is
the
last
beer
out
of
a
6pack
that
i
got
and
i
may
come
back
to
it
someday
but
will
probably
pick
up
a
number
of
other
beers
first
poured
into
a
tall
pilsner
good
head
about
2
fingers
that
dissipated
slowly
with
consistent
lacing
immediately
noticed
caramel
smells
and
a
toffee
caramel
nutty
taste
similar
to
a
st
arnolds
amber
but
with
less
body
good
beer
to
pair
with
spicy
light
foods
or
grilled
meats
refreshing
and
super
super
cheap
picked
up
a
6er
at
heb
for
7
bucks
i
really
like
this
beer
but
im
having
a
hard
time
finding
alot
to
say
pick
one
up
for
yourself
taste
left
some
to
be
desired
the
malts
and
hops
were
well
balanced
enough
but
the
aftertaste
was
not
terribly
pleasant
there
was
a
slight
adjunct
taste
to
this
beer
does
not
compare
to
other
blonde
ales
ive
had
even
though
it
wasnt
horrible
pretty
good
beer
worthwhile
on
a
summer
day
i
enjoyed
it
but
i
would
rather
try
something
new
next
time
overall
drinkability
this
beer
has
some
good
aspects
but
the
cardboard
finish
ruins
the
drinkability
its
very
refreshing
beer
very
drinkable
and
sessionable
only
thing
lacking
is
the
flavor
otherwise
its
a
good
summers
beer
easy
to
drink
on
a
hot
san
antonio
evening
and
enough
flavor
to
satisfy
this
pours
a
dull
yellow
golden
color
under
a
sparsley
spotted
thin
film
head
layer
there
is
a
restrained
but
pleasant
aroma
of
sweet
malt
honey
and
lemon
citrus
this
is
a
mouth
awakening
experience
a
top
other
blonde
styles
ive
tried
it
opens
up
with
a
somewhat
puckering
sour
and
sweet
lemon
bitterness
and
makes
way
to
a
sudden
robust
malt
center
and
a
smooth
refreshing
finish
theres
also
a
significant
amount
of
visible
sediment
that
collects
at
the
bottom
of
the
glass
robust
refreshing
and
perfect
for
those
hot
summer
days
in
texas
overall
i
would
not
buy
this
beer
again
on
tap
but
was
worth
trying
once
i
would
recommend
this
beer
to
someone
who
wanted
a
simple
beer
with
drinkability
next
time
i
will
have
to
try
alamo
in
a
bottle
to
see
if
there
is
a
difference
maybe
it
taste
better
that
way
drinkability
a
simple
light
beer
designed
for
simple
light
refreshment
and
in
that
duty
it
does
fine
i
suppose
remember
the
alamo
though
you
may
have
trouble
remembering
this
brew
down
the
road
easy
to
drink
better
than
expected
on
tap
at
the
airport
in
san
antonio
clear
golden
yellow
smells
boooring
the
taste
is
actually
pretty
good
crisp
slight
bit
of
lemon
not
too
bad
extremely
easy
to
drink
would
order
again
but
fortunately
i
will
probably
never
have
to
go
back
to
texas
as
the
description
says
it
will
help
put
out
the
fire
but
so
will
a
tall
glass
of
ice
water
a
good
looking
beer
didnt
match
it
in
the
taste
taste
starts
a
little
musky
with
some
notes
of
clove
but
its
watery
there
is
also
a
little
sweetness
to
it
the
finish
is
dry
this
beer
actually
delivered
more
than
i
was
expecting
its
fuller
and
more
robust
than
i
imagined
it
still
thats
not
to
say
that
i
would
go
out
of
my
way
to
drink
this
beer
again
because
i
wouldnt
but
it
was
somewhat
better
than
i
expected
it
to
be
and
thats
always
a
good
thing
worth
trying
if
youre
working
your
way
through
all
the
beers
in
texas
alamo
ale
of
course
being
in
san
antonio
for
the
first
time
i
had
to
try
it
i
was
a
bit
disappointed
as
i
thought
it
could
definitely
be
better
it
wasnt
bad
but
it
wasnt
great
either
it
poured
a
clear
slightlydarkerthanstraw
color
with
a
decent
head
on
it
that
hung
around
a
little
bit
smell
was
of
light
malts
and
a
touch
of
hops
flavor
followed
suit
a
decent
hit
of
malts
blended
with
a
light
flavor
of
hops
produces
a
clean
and
crisp
flavor
and
mouthfeel
its
nothing
spectacular
but
its
a
decent
ale
it
could
be
improved
with
only
a
little
work
however
that
said
given
the
alamo
theme
my
feeling
is
that
its
more
targeted
towards
the
average
beer
drinker
whos
visiting
texas
and
gets
pulled
in
by
the
novelty
of
the
label
still
its
worth
a
try
i
could
see
it
being
a
great
hotsummerday
type
beer
better
than
a
macro
lager
a
no
frills
beer
i
believe
this
is
brewed
by
real
ale
brewing
according
to
the
bottle
contract
brewed
what
a
fun
idea
i
love
the
alamo
but
is
this
the
best
we
can
drink
to
drink
to
the
alamo
refreshing
and
light
yes
tasty
no
not
really
i
assume
this
brew
is
targeted
to
moreofyouraveragebeerdrinkercrowdtype
persons
but
why
cant
it
taste
better
it
is
just
shy
of
good
drank
really
easy
suprised
i
didnt
see
it
around
more
down
by
the
riverwalk
give
this
a
chance
overall
a
nice
offering
and
ill
keep
this
one
in
mind
when
spring
rolls
around
again
cheers2beers
this
is
a
very
drinkable
brew
quite
a
nice
surprise
from
a
blonde
ale
from
a
beer
trade
first
time
ive
heard
of
this
hopefully
this
will
be
distributed
back
east
pours
a
hazy
golden
orange
color
smell
is
of
light
citrus
taste
is
a
citrusy
hop
flavor
quite
like
graprfruit
which
fades
out
quite
quickly
mouthfeel
is
a
little
thinner
than
expected
but
overall
this
is
a
really
great
beer
to
drink
reminds
me
of
a
more
flavorful
summer
ale
i
think
this
is
the
only
style
alamo
makes
hopefully
they
will
branch
out
a
bit
more
picked
this
up
just
before
leaving
sa
on
the
way
back
to
il
had
to
wait
more
than
24
hours
before
trying
i
wish
id
had
a
chance
to
sample
a
draft
version
but
this
one
is
a
very
drinkable
ale
one
i
will
definitely
get
again
next
time
in
the
river
city
this
beer
makes
for
a
good
session
ale
the
beer
i
am
drinking
looks
the
same
as
in
the
picture
i
dont
know
if
this
is
the
same
alamo
beer
i
tried
at
the
menger
hotel
in
san
antonio
going
on
two
years
ago
or
a
completely
new
concoction
the
alamobeer
website
only
furthered
my
befuddlement
comments
although
the
beer
has
many
positive
characteristics
i
am
not
really
fond
of
it
this
would
make
a
good
summer
beer
overall
impression
very
enjoyable
refreshing
and
clean
this
is
a
great
summer
session
or
lawnmower
i
think
the
label
and
name
are
a
bit
gimmicky
but
what
ever
it
takes
to
get
real
ales
product
out
there
strongly
recommended
alamo
golden
is
a
hazy
golden
orange
in
color
head
is
white
and
frothy
the
aroma
is
a
fairly
nondescript
generic
sweetness
not
bad
smelling
but
not
much
character
taste
is
sweet
almost
as
if
there
is
a
little
honey
involved
there
is
also
a
distinct
herbal
tealike
taste
towards
the
middle
of
the
sip
finish
is
a
lingering
combination
of
sweet
malts
and
herbal
flavor
drinkability
is
very
good
this
is
a
nice
lighter
ale
for
sessioning
still
this
beer
isnt
nearly
as
good
as
the
other
real
ale
offerings
ive
sampled
the
bar
staff
along
the
riverwalk
couldnt
tell
me
anything
about
the
brewer
i
began
to
suspect
contract
brewing
this
beer
is
a
slightly
hazy
dirty
gold
with
a
small
white
foamy
head
the
aroma
is
nutty
a
little
sour
a
little
wheaty
a
little
floral
the
front
is
tangy
fruity
and
floral
the
fizzy
middle
is

light
and
a
little
milky
the
finish
is
very
roasty
and
nutty
with
some
nice
bitterness
and
a
little
more
fruit
delicious
a
long
lingering
grainsy
aftertaste
apple

its
a
nice
flavorful
nutty
blonde
i
like
it
a
lot
alamo
in
a
bottle
pours
with
a
quickly
dissipating
head
and
is
a
rich
gold
there
are
slight
citrus
notes
and
some
floral
hops
in
the
nose
this
is
a
great
for
those
that
like
some
character
in
their
beer
without
going
over
the
top
in
any
of
the
aspects
while
this
is
not
terribly
light
it
is
a
summery
beer
with
a
decent
balance
a
little
hay
and
orange
peel
in

aftertaste
didnt

a
bit
sickly
and
disgusting
although
still
relatively
crafty
i
keep
wanting
to
say
its
like
high
life
with
some
bad
honey
lemon
added
to
it
i
expected
more
honey
sweetness
instead
i
got
an
adjunct
lager
taste
honey
hops
and
soap
maybe
i
set
my
soaps
er
hopes
too
high
with
that
being
said
im
sure
it
pairs
with
certain
foods
in
a
good
way
as
for
the
remainder
down
the
drain
it
goes
it
served
its
purpose
overall
this
a
decent
light
refreshing
summer
beer
not
outstanding
but
good
nonetheless
pours
a
pretty
golden
color
with
a
thin
white
head
lots
of
lacing
is
seen
which
each
sip
which
settles
back
down
the
sides
of
the
glass
the
aroma
is
of
pale
malts
with
some
honey
sweetness
the
taste
is
about
the
same
with
a
hint
of
white
pepper
with
the
right
amount
of
honey
goes
down
very
easy
with
no
harsh
after
taste
perfect
carbonation
this
is
a
great
blonde
ale
that
isnt
over
done
o
it
may
not
be
interesting
or
complex
but
its
good
and
its
refreshing
definitely
recommended
especially
on
a
hot
summer
day
poured
into
a
dogfish
head
pint
glass
pours
a
medium
golden
amber
with
a
two
finger
white
head
that
dissipates
slowly
to
a
thin
cap
and
heavy
ring
around
the
edges
aroma
of
light
bready
malt
grassy
hops
and
a
hint
of
sourness
flavor
is
biscuit
malt
light
honey
and
grassy
hops
finishing
with
grassy
hop
bitterness
light
flavored
and
otherwise
unremarkable
but
redeemed
somewhat
by
the
light
honey
in
the
background
there
is
a
slight
brisk
hoppy
taste
with
a
slight
bitter
aftertaste
a
hint
of
resin
and
something
herbal
not
much
to
get
excited
about
but
a
decent
representative
of
the
style
a
little
honey
and
flowers
in
the
nose
from
the
12
oz
bottle
bought
at
ajs
fine
foods
in
phoenix
poured
this
american
blonde
ale
from
a
12
oz
bottle
into
a
pint
glass
poured
a
clear
yellow
color
produced
a
nice
white
head
decent
retention
and
a
nice
amount
of
lacing
left
on
the
glass
the
aroma
consisted
of
pale
malt
white
pepper
and
a
touch
of
honey
medium
bodied
easy
to
drink
there
was
a
foundation
of
pale
malt
sweet
honey
and
fruitiness
dry
finish
overall
decent
summer
brew
but
there
is
nothing
that
makes
this
beer
stand
out
i
love
a
lighter
beer
for
the
warmer
weather
that
has
some
taste
to
it
other
than
corn
mash
this
one
fits
the
bill
nicely
and
i
will
definitely
seek
this
out
again
o
not
great
below
average
avoid
pours
a
semiclear
amber
color
with
a
slight
but
fast
diminishing
head
scent
is
sweet
with
wheat
and
hints
of
honey
taste
is
light
refreshing
and
smooth
the
texture
is
decent
for
a
summer
beer
but
could
perhaps
still
be
a
bit
thicker
the
taste
is
sweet
with
malts
and
honey
for
a
summer
beer
its
not
to
bad
but
big
sky
does
have
better
made
beers
on
the
market
one
of
the
many
easydrinking
summer
seasonals
that
shows
up
every
year
like
most
this
doesnt
offer
much
in
flavor
but
what
it
has
is
pleasant
subtle
spicing
sets
it
apart
some
light

i
cant
put

on

which
helps

it
mildly
interesting
a
decent
little
summer
beer
from
the
last
best
place
nothing
outstanding
but
worth
a
taste
or
two
o
very
good
certainly
adds
something
in
taste
to
the
concept
of
a
summer
beer
innovative
o
another
great
beer
by
big
sky
my
second
favorite
brewery
this
is
delicious
and
the
perfect
amount
of
sweetness
makes
this
a
great
session
beer
o
overall
this
has
been
my
least
favorite
offering
from
big
sky
brewing
overall
i
usually
dont
favor
honey
beers
but
this
stuff
tastes
great
its
very
drinkable
and
i
hope
to
find
it
again

big

summer
honey
ale
is
a
good
choice
for
a
refreshing
summertime
brew
dr
drinkable
but
forgettable
i
might
try
it
again
on
draught
if
im
feeling
squirrelly
but
otherwise
ill
just
avoid
this
in
the
future
this
was
the
fourth
and
final
beer
i
had
from
their
variety
pack
i
see
no
reason
to
have
anything
from
this
brewery
in
the
future
unless
it
comes
naturally
to
me
they
seem
to
be
pretty
shite
at
first
i
was
a
bit
confused
by
the
honey
but
it
grew
on
me
very
quickly
this
is
really
one
of
the
best
uses
of
honey
ive
encountered
in
quite
some
time
im
note
sure
if
its
what
i
want
in
a
summer
beer
but
it
works
quite
well
right
now
as
im
drinking
it
in
october
this
is
a
drinkable
and
light
ale
that
would
definitely
be
a
good
one
to
quaff
at
a
summer
party
i
found
it
to
be
pretty
unremarkable
but
solid
none
the
less
nice
and
hopped
grassy
with
some
decent
touches
of
light
citrus
and
pine
mixed
in
a
biscuit
like
bready
middle
to
it
that
really
came
out
once
it
warmed
up
the
flavor
was
more
of
the
same
crisp
and
clean
with
a
quick
hitting
citric
hop
bite
crisp
and
clean
o
overall
i
liked
it
and
im
happy
about
the

a

and

aromas
of

sweet
malts
and
herbal

but
very
uninspiringthe

is
light
bodied
and
dissapointing
with
tastes
of

and
finished
with
a
spicy

hoppy
dryness
and
overall
its
below
par
with
an
average
mouthfeel
that
doesnt
suit
and
would
not
buy
again
cheers
an
interesting
concoction
enjoyable
but
not
especially
memorable
certainly
a
good
summer
option
if
youre
looking
for
something
a
little
different
pours

with

fades
to

foamy
rings
of
lace

on

on
the

down
smell
is
of
malt
honey
and
some
spice
notes
taste
is
of
toasted

and
spices
there
is
a
slight
bitterness
on
the
tongue
after
each
sip
that
lingers
for
a
bit
a
good
level
of
carbonation
makes
for
a
crisp
and
clean
mouthfeel
overall
this
is
a
pretty
good
beer
but
not
something
i
would
buy
more
of
overall
its
tasty
and
i
would
like
to
get
it
in
cans
for
a
day
of
fishin
overall
this
beer
was
pretty
boring
there
are
many
summer
honey
style
beers
i
prefer
over
this
one
i
wouldnt
get
this
again
under
the
cap
if
yer
gonna
be
stoopid
ya
gotta
be
tough
this
brew
poured
up
a
clear
golden
body
with
a
onefinger
head
from
a
somewhat
vigorous
pour
retention
was
minimal
reducing
down
to
a
bubbly
film
on
top
with
minimal

effects
smell
lots
of
sweet
honey
and
spices
throughout
served
fridgecold
scents
and
flavors
of
honey
duh
and
various
spices
and
very
little
detection
of
hops
or
malts
throughout
it
does
go
down
very
well
on
a
hot
hot
night
probably
a
good
gateway
beer
from
macro
beers
to
craft
brew
other
than
that
i
look
for
something
with
a
little
more
action
not
great
but
good
when
its
cold
pours
a
clear
golden
color
with
a
decent
two
finger
white
head
aromas
of
toasted
biscuit
malt
and
honey
kind
of
reminds
me
a
bit
of
honey
nut
cheerios
but
not
in
a
bad
way
also
picking
up
a
bit
of
lemon
on
the
end
flavor
pretty
much
follows
suit
i
remember
having
this
beer
a
few
years
ago
and
not
being
a
huge
fan
but
its
actually
tasting
pretty
good
to
me
today
o
this
is
definitely
a
summer
session
beer
in
my
mind
there
isnt
anything
remarkable
about
it
but
thats
ok
i
think
it
would
appeal
to
the
bmc
drinkers
that
you
might
want
to
try
giving
a
little
push
in
the
craft
direction
this
beer
has
a
light
body
and
mouth
feel
from
the
first
sip
to
the
last
swig
if
you
are
into
drinking
lighter
beers
aka
bud
coors
etc
this
is
right
in
your
ballpark
but
a
step
up
without
getting
all
heavy
on
you
d
will
surely
enjoy
this
one
again
this
summer
not
overtly
sweet
nor
bitter
good
hump
day
timed
to
wet
the
whistle
with
alil
summer
honey
from
big
sky
the
appearance
is
good
crisp
clear
and
golden
with
good
carbonation
that
forms
a
thin
white
head
the
nose
is
strong
with
honey
grain
and
some
spice
the
taste
is
decent
good
honey
start
polished
off
by
a
little

taste
the
mouthfeel
is
good
and
it
is
a
fine
beer
to
have
on
a
summer
day
taste
is
also
rather
muted
hops
and
honey
are
not
relevant
sweetness
is
more
reminiscent
of
corn
than
honey
faintly
bready
light

girlfriendintro
beer
o
good
beer
nothing
over
the
top
crazy
but
a
great
beer
for
a
hot
summer
day
could
drink
several
of
these
o
overall
the
beer
was
good
but
it
wasnt
exciting
none
of
the
flavors
were
very
distinctive
from
the
malt
base
to
whichever
hops
were
used
i
would
drink
this
beer
again
but
i
wouldnt
expect
it
to
be
memorable
overall
an
average
beer
and
a
below
average
apa
that
i
wont
remember
soon
as
i
crack
the
next
beer
really
like
some
other
big
sky
offerings
but
this
one
is
a
miss
for
me
avail
here
in
tx
too
many
other
offerings
out
there
to
make
the
rotation
nn
d
meh
not
very
impressed
i
wouldnt
drink
another
one
d
no
real
appeal
here
much
better
summer
ales
available
its
still
summer
right
regardless
this
brew
pours
a
clear
wan
gold
topped
by
a
shortlived
halffinger
of
white
foam
the
nose
comprises
wheat
light
honey
light
corn
syrup
light
flowers
and
light
lemonade
did
i
mention
the
lightness
the
taste
brightens
things
up
a
bit
but
not
very
much
a
hint
of
nuttiness
joins
the
party
along
with
some
very
light
orange
flesh
the
body
is
surprise
surprise
pretty
light
with
a
light
carbonation
and
a
slightly
watery
feel
overall
a
nice
light
brew
for
summer
but
i
do
wish
there
were
more
to
it
one
of
the
easiest
drinking
honey
beers
ive
had
could
actually
probably
stomach
more
than
just
one
at
a
time
like
most
honeys
thumbs
up
on
this
one
pours
a
pale
golden
color
with
a
white
head
nose
brings
forward
a
dash
of
honey
and
a
little
bit
of
mildly
floral
hops
pretty
plain
overall
and
this
carries
over
into
the
taste
there
is
some
faint
honeybaked
bread
along
with
some
ever
so
slight
bitterness
feel
is
light
and
well
carbonated
no
apparent
defects
just
nothing
really
going
for
it
drinkability
very
tasty
brew
no
lingering
aftertaste
and
very
clean
in
general
easy
one
to
come
back
to
and
a
great
summer
brew
the
taste
is
light
crisp
slightly
sweet
with
honey
grain
and
a
biscuitygrain
aftertaste
very
pleasant
smooth
light
and
crisp
it
is
highly
drinkable
pleasant
and
does
the
job
well
drinkability
overall
a
decent
beer
with
very
little
complexity
ill
admit
i
expected
more
from
the
makers
of
moose
drool
but
alas
its
just
okay
good
beer
nothing
overly
special
sure
but
enjoyable
enough
when
the
season
and
occasion
call
for
it
a
good
beer
to
go
with
intensely
spicy
hot
wings
as
was
the
pairing
in
my
case
yknow
when
in
rome
and
all
that
tasted
from
12oz
bottle
pours
pale
golden
with
a
thin
and
quickly
receding
white
head
light
nose
of
wheat
and
some
honey
simple
flavors
of
wheat
and
honey
with
some
spices
on
the
back
of
the
palate
body
is
light
and
carbonation
is
very
lively
with
a
rather
short
spiced
finish
overall
i
am
not
crazy
about
this
beer
skip
this
commercial
garbage
my
pour
created
a
finger
of
eggshellwhite
head
with
good
retention
the
color
was
a
goldenyellow
with
nequality
clarity
i
got
the
honey
up
front
on
the
nose
there
was
a
light
spiciness
in
there
but
it
seemed
more
yeastdriven
than
anything
else
mouthfeel
was
slightly
thin
with
a
honeysweet
taste
on
the
tongue
finish
had
a
spicy
dryness
that
i
would
have
otherwise
attributed
to
a
yeast
strain
doing
its
thing
the
spices
were
there
but
they
did
not
seem
readily
identifiable
to
me
this
is
definitely
a
summer
beer
light
smooth
dry
on
the
finish
a
definite
candidate
for
the
cooler
if
only
it
were
readily
available
tasty
lightmedium
body
very
drinkable
drinkability
is
pretty
good
this
is
a
decent
honey
ale
dryer
and
less
sweet
than
i
expected
which
was
a
pleasant
surprise
all
in
all
a
pretty
good
summer
beer
pours
a
light
golden
yellow
with
a
creamy
head
that
settles
to
a
half
inch
film
sweet
and
floral
smelling
some
black
pepper
and
faint
baking
spices
like
cloves
and
cinamon
come
out
very
clean
and
crisp
flavor
sweetness
with
a
little
peppery
kick
to
start
finishes
bone
dry
with
a
just
with
a
little
bitterness
and
a
touch
more
spice
this
stuff
works
for
what
its
for
very
refreshing
hot
weather
all
day
drinking
kind
of
beer
d
pretty
high
easy
to
drink
nothing
about
that
taste
wants
to
make
you
not
have
another
one
if
you
are
just
relaxing
with
friends
and
want
to
throw
a
few
back
this
is
a
great
choice
instead
of
buying
a
mass
marketed
beer
flavor
has
more
going
for
it
than
the
aroma
with
sweet
malts
honey
apple
and
cinnamon
finishes
clean
lighter
bodied
smooth
and
moderately
carbonated
crisp
clean
mouthfeel
quite
drinkable
d
this
is
an
okay
beer
it
really
seems
more
like
a
blonde
ale
than
an
apa
overall
this
seems
like
a
bit
of
a
misfit
despite
being
a
pretty
good
beer
i
just
dont
know
what
season
it
fits
in
because
the
mouthfeel
seems
too
heavy
for
a
springsummer
beer
but
the
flavor
is
in
that
range
poured
this
pale
wheat
colored
beer
into
a
pint
glass
the
foam
that
was
created
off
the
pour
was
that
of
a
12
inch
then
reduced
down
to
wisps
of
lacing
the
wheat
and
floweral
tones
of
the
beer
off
the
aroma
is
tantalizing
the
taste
isnt
that
great
that
follows
the
aroma
it
has
a
bittering
taste
of
the
wheat
that
doesnt
create
a
great
pallet
the
after
taste
is
likewise
but
doesnt
linger
for
that
long
sorry
big
sky
your
ipa
moose
drool
and
scape
goat
are
still
great
the
beer
pours
a
very
clear
yellow
color
with
a
white
head
the
aroma
is
honey
and
wheat
the
flavor
is
more
of
the
same
with
lots
of
wheat
and
honey
flavors
for
a
pale
ale
there
is
hardly
any
hop
character
medium
mouthfeel
and
low
to
medium
carbonation
a
nice
easy
drinking
beer
but
that
is
about
it
an
easydrinking
apa
from
big
sky
not
great
but
definitely
good
overall
i
enjoyed
this
beer
but
dont
think
ill
get
it
again
this
is
a
moderately
enjoyable
brew
but
once
i
finished
off
the
bottles
i
had
no
desire
to
revisit
it
again
a
bit
too
sweet
and
thin
for
my
tastes
overall
the
mouth
fee
is
light
carbonated
and
a
tad
crisp
the
body
is
also
light
and
the
finish
is
mild
i
am
not
impressed
this
beer
does
not
taste
like
an
apa
i
think
it
is
a
tad
sweet
and
not
enough

to
speak

taste
is
sweet
and
full
of
honey
upfront
with
emerging
hints
of
lemon
and
orange
to
provide
a
sour
balance
body
is
light
and
carbonation
is
high
i
could
take
down
a
six
pack
fairly
easily
but
i
would
prefer
to
drink
other
styles
overall
its
not
bad
for
a
honey
ale
style
but
i
like
a
more
flavorful
brew
d
not
bad
on
a
hot
day
but
there
are
quite
a
few
others
i
would
reach
for
instead
not
worth
seeking
out
a
fine
choice
and
good
to
drink
if
its
available
to
you
not
worth
going
out
for
your
way
for
though
appearance
is
a
golden
orange
and
minimal
head
after
an
aggressive
pour
minimal
lacing
but
lots
of
carbonation
not
much
hits
the
nose
but
the
aroma
is
sweet
malts
and
maybe
a
little
bit
of
honey
taste
is
similar
to
the
nose
with
it
seeming
very
watered
down
little
hints
of
sweet
honey
and
a
rather
dry
bland
finish
mouthfeel
is
very
thin
and
drinkability
is
rather
low
not
a
very
exciting
beer
in
any
way
a
good
effort
from
big
sky
but
i
found
it
to
be
a
tad
too
sweet
for
my
taste
the
honey
is
quite
dominant
and
thus
not
very
wellbalanced
may
do
well
to
lure
some
away
from
mead
the
body
was
very
thin
you
almost
dont
even
notice
its
in
your
mouth
the
beer
was
certainly
drinkable
but
why
bother
try
this
if
youre
looking
to
add
another
notch
on
your
gunhandle
but
otherwise
avoid
this
beer
pours
a
clear
honey
color
with
a
one
finger
of
white
head
that
disappears
immediately
minimal
to
no
lacing
on
this
beer
nose
is
of
pale
malts
honey
and
faint
wheat
tones
taste
is
of
grainy
and
pale
malts
up
front
then
a
bit
of
citrus
with
a
honey
sweetness
in
the
finish
lighter
bodied
medium
carbonation
really
thin
feel
but
finishes
with
a
crispness
a
bit
too
sweet
and
leaning
towards
bland
on
the
taste
though
stops
before
becoming
too
honeyish
not
one
i
would
seek
out
but
refreshing
enough
on
a
hot
day
easy
enough
to
drink
as
theres
not
much
to
it
and
carbonation
is
controlled
making
it
pretty
smooth
more
of
an
american
blonde
than
an
apa
to
me
overall
a
decent
slightly
plain
summer
beer
d
ive
been
a
fan
of
big
sky
in
the
past
i
just
didnt
find
this
one
very
good
a
pass
for
me
im
a
fan
of
bears
referencing
my
7
years
of
photographing
them
so
i
decided
to
pick
up
a
bottle
of
bis
skys
summer
beer
its
almost
like
a
pilsner
with
honey
flavor
its
a
medium
goldamber
color
thats
visually
appealing
with
a
small
amount
of
head
the
aroma
is
hoppy
taste
wise
it
has
very
mellow
malts
with
the
honey
almost
undetectable
it
goes
down
and
finishes
very
smoothly
it
burbs
good
its
ok
but
it
just
doesnt
stand
out
any
drinkability
easy
drinking
lightly
flavorful
though
somewhat
forgettable
yep
its
about
average
for
a
simple
summertime
libation
not
really
an
apa
to
me
but
an
okay
offering
nonetheless
it
goes
down
easy
but
is
heavier
than
i
might
like
there
is
something
to
this
one
being
cold
that
gives
it
a
kolsch
feel
i
have
to
admit
this
might
be
releiving
on
a
hot
day
drinkability
is
moderate
the
beer
is
easily
sessionable
at
only
4
7
abv
however
its
a
bit
dull
and
uninspiring
which
doesnt
exactly
compel
the
drinker
to
have
another
or
finish
the
current
one
for
that
matter
its
ok
but
subpar
in
my
book
drinks
well
i
have
enjoyed
all
of
the
big
sky
beers
so
far
this
one
is
a
nice
departure
from
the
typical
apa
pours
a
clear
yellow
color
one
inch
head
of
an
offwhite
color
good
retention
and
good
lacing
smells
of
hops
honey
citrus
and
pine
fits
the
style
of
an
american
pale
ale
mouth
feel
is
smooth
and
slightly
thick
with
an
average
carbonation
level
tastes
of
hops
pine
slight
honey
and
citrus
there
is
a
slight
dryness
associated
with
this
brew
overall
a
very
drinkable
apa
with
decent
body
one
thing
that
i
have
noticed
about
big
sky
is
as
they
get
more
known
the
quality
seems
to
be
going
down
many
of
their
beers
take
on
a
watery
feel
this
should
be
the
case
when
i
spend
15
on
a
12
pack
and
this
is
on
a
good
day
pours
a
crystal
clear
golden
with
a
big
white
head
smell
is
faintly
of
grain
not
much
here
taste
is
light
and
grainy
super
clean
grain
bill
and
a
good
bitterness
from
the
hops
rounds
it
out
not
much
hop
flavor
mouthfeel
is
somewhat
watery
and
thin
high
carbonation
quite
drinkable
though
a
simple
nofrills
beer
that
would
be
nice
to
drink
every
once
in
awhile
though
this
really
doesnt
seem
like
an
american
pale
ale
i
would
say
its
an
american
blonde
ale
its
worth
a
shot
crisp
clean
mouthfeel
with
a
short
finish
thirstquenching
plenty
drinkable
a
good
summer
beer
very
pale
in
color
and
very
clear
appearance
the
color
of
light
honey
perhaps
traditional
beer
smells
of
grain
and
malt
in
the
mainstreammacrobrew
sort
of
way
frothy
head
with
a
smooth
and
thick
attack
and
mouthfeel
the
flavor
is
rich
in
that
macro
sort
of
way
the
finish
is
clean
this
beer
i
think
would
have
very
wide
mainstream
appeal
and
would
be
handy
to
have
in
the
cooler
for
a
party
it
makes
me
think
of
honey
brown
only
a
superior
version
of
it
perhaps
the
name
clouds
my
judgment
though
very
refreshing
and
a
great
summer
alternative
to
the
usual
weissbier
or
kolsch
not
sure
this
beer
is
really
a
pale
ale
not
hoppy
enough
would
fit
more
in
the
pale
wheat
category
but
i
got
a
ipa
in
the
sampler
pack
as
well
so
i
cant
complain
nonetheless
its
refreshing
and
quaffable
i
could
sit
down
and
drink
this
all
day
and
not
be
offended
the
taste
on
the
other
hand
was
not
bad
just
a
bit
to
yeasty
i
guess
almost
like
a
grain
belt
however
i
think
it
needs
that
because
there
isnt
much
else
in
there
a
decent
enough
summer
beer
ill
have
to
remember
this
for
the
hot
days
because
this
beer
is
probably
quite
good
out
of
a
bottle
notes
from
and
tasted
on
91106
rated
aug
9
2007
its
an
ok
quencher
but
not
overly
exciting
or
flavorful
ill
stick
to
the
moose
drool
i
really
do
like
several
big
sky
beers
and
this
is
not
one
of
them
the
beer
really
does
have
a
honey
color
aroma
and
taste
white
foam
dissipated
fasr
very
subtle
honey
in
the
aroma
and
tase
department
and
there
is
nothing
else
going
on
other
than
it
is
balanced
i
dont
like
this
one
i
dont
find
it
drinkable
for
me
to
drink
this
one
again
my
other
choices
will
have
to
be
quite
horrid
out
of
the
bottle
this
montana
brew
was
a
wetstraw
gold
color
with
a
white
head
one
finger
thick
faded
after
a
few
minutes
to
a
thin
skim
and
then
a
tiny
ring
moderate
lacing
aromas
are
mostly
wheat
and
some
hops
with
pale
malt
behind
it
flavors
are
almost
all
wheat
crisp
but
the
honey
is
very
hard
to
find
slightly
sour
wet
finish
of
grains
sticks
to
the
tongue
decent
mouthfeel
and
fizzy
carbonation
ok
but
not
much
more
than
that
papery
pale
malt
flavor
mild
graham
sweetness
not
really
getting
any
floral
or
honey
flavor
average
is
about
all
i
can
say
moderate
fizz
drinks
fine
a
nobrainer
for
a
dog
day
the
mouth
is
decent
with
unlooked
for
heft
i
suppose
this
is
an
easy
enough
drinker
and
would
be
a
nice
crossover
beer
drinkablity
easy

and
tasty
brew
dat

i
have
no
complaints
drinking
it
apart
from
the
very
disappointing
flavor
profile
pours
a
clear
straw
with
a
quick
head
and
no
lacing
or
foam
good
bubbles
though
the
aroma
is
a
delicate
mix
of
pale
malts
adn
light
spices
hen
somesoft
honey
and
musty
hops
the
tase
immediately
mkes
me
think
of
an
american
pale
wheat
ale
musty
german
hops
with
some
light
honey
bread
sweetness
and
even
lighter
spice
notes
the
palate
is
sweet
but
a
little
musty
but
the
finish
has
a
nice
honey
and
spice
combo
tastes
more
like
an
american
wheat
ale
than
an
apa
d
very
drinkable
great
for
sessions
or
parties
probably
just
fine
even
in
the
nonsummer
seasons
and
obviously
far
better
than
any
macro
of
any
sort
pale
filtered
straw
colored
in
the
body
head
is
white
and
fuzzy
with
modest
retention
the
aroma
is
mild
hop
and
tea
leaf
notes
with
touches
of
sweetness
could
that
be
the
honey
as
it
enters
the
mouth
i
immediately
become
refreshed
off
its
easy
and
light
flavor
almost
citrusy
tasting
bready
notes
break
up
the
monotone
flavor
i
cant
seem
to
find
the
honey
character
okay
its
there
but
its
very
light
this
is
a
simple
and
refreshing
beer
i
have
to
admit
that
i
didnt
pour
this
into
a
glass
and
so
i
gave
the
appearance
a
3
0
as
a
default
i
dont
think
the
appearance
could
have
saved
this
one
though
it
tasted
very
watery
to
me
like
a
light
macro
beer
but
with
some
honey
flavor
added
i
know
that
a
summer
ale
is
supposed
to
be
light
but
this
one
was
dismal
good
beer
and
i
am
probably
downplaying
it
but
overall
i
want
a
little
bit
more
out
of
my
summer
seasonals
but
still
very
nice
i
am
actually
very
surprised
that
ive
never
reviewed
this
one
before
despite
my
dozens
of
times
enjoying
it
drinkablility
goes
doen
easy
enjoy
anytime
i
dont
care
what
the
name
says
a
nice
beer
this
should
be
a
revisited
every
summer
recommended
great
summer
brew
not
too
heavy
but
still
does
the
trick
when
camping
with
friends
cool
and
crisp
a
slight
hop
bite
greets
you
followed
by
a
mellow
honey
twang
almost
unnoticable
not
much
on
hop
aroma
possibly
mt
hood
or
even
cascade
if
i
had
to
venture
a
guess
a
definate
and
constant
summer
must
for
me
and
my
friends
as
we
all
enjoy
this
one
to
start
the
night
off
before
moving
to
the
cheap
stuff
i
see
this
is
being
deeply
discounted
in
a
lot
of
places
if
you
like
it
stock
up
when
poured
from
a
12
oz
bottle
the
first
thing
i
notice
is
the
thick
lacy
head
that
after
it
is
gone
leaves
soap
like
suds
on
the
edge
of
the
glass
the
color
was
a
pale
amber
yellow
the
first
thing
i
could
smell
was
a
wild
coriandercilantro
and
a
little
bit
of
citrus
taste
was
about
the
same
with
a
little
more
veggie
taste
mouthfeel
was
creamy
but
clean
nice
and
sudsy
drinkability
is
awesome
on
this
one
i
really
enjoyed
this
beer
a
lot
better
this
time
than
the
first
time
i
had
it
the
beer
pours
from
the
12
ounce
bottle
a
slightly
foggy
gold
with
a
portly
bright
white
creamy
head
that
dissipates
leaving
the
lace
a
firm
sheet
upon
the
glass
nosey
is
sweet
with
honey
and
malt
citrus
like
in
its
crispness
start
has
a
pleasant
honey
taste
nice
malt
presence
the
top
light
to
medium
in
feel
finish
has
a
sparkling
acidity
the
hops
underpowered
sweetness
continues
to
the
end
also
a
bit
dry
a
drinkable
beer
maybe
a
bit
to
sweet
for
me
but
not
a
major
malfunction
drinkability
isnt
quite
there
i
try
to
be
optimistic
when
trying
and
rating
styles
that
i
dont
have
a
strong
affinity
for
big
sky
does
justice
in
the
fact
that
its
a
decent
summer
ale
light
and
refreshing
just
seems
that
some
more
honey
and
a
moderate
increase
in
hopping
couldve
kicked
this
one
up
a
few
notches
drinkability
purchased
a
mix
12
pack
to
try
the
big
sky
beers
i
should
have
waited
til
they
had
a
different
seasonal
in
the
pack
i
would
not
purchase
this
as
a
stand
alone
product
could
not
drink
many
of
these
because
it
is
heavy
for
a
lighter
beer
the
taste
is
disappointing
as
well
theres
a
touch
of
honey
barely
detectable
with
a
bland
blend
of
wheat
and
bitter
spice
pretty
awful
stuff
really
mouthfeel
is
crisp
and
astringent
with
a
high
level
of
carbonation
but
a
bad
aftertaste
that
tries
its
best
at
a
bitter
finish
but
ultimately
fails
all
in
all
i
wouldnt
ever
buy
this
again
quite
the
flop
of
a
summer
brew
from
the
makers
of
such
a
finetasting
beer
as
moose
drool
i
hope
this
is
just
a
case
of
a
bad
bottle
not
good
not
recommended
most
went
down
the
drain
as
ive
found
with
spiceheavy
brews
let
this
one
sit
out
a
minute
to
appreciate
the
subtlety
of
the
ingredients
very
crisp
when
cold
lots
of
carbonation
light
of
body
a
touch
watery
but
quaffable
not
bad
served
in
a
shaker
medium
pour
yields
a
onefingered
off
white
head
of
medium
duration
and
fairly
good
lacing
very
clear
golden
in
color
with
moderate
carbonation
nose
is
subtle
honey
and
lightly
sweet
pale
malts
slightly
vegetal
and
no
apparent
hops
honey
is
apparent
on
the
first
sip
but
is
fleeting
a
bit
more
than
the
minimun
impression
is
left
before
the
semisweet
malts
round
out
the
palate
and
a
dryer
biscuity
malt
takes
over
nice
and
dry
in
the
finish
somewhat
fruity
and
aromatic
with
clover
honey
just
a
guess
and
apple
blossoms
aftertaste
leaves
an
impression
of
peach
which
is
actually
quite
nice
the
hops
are
there
also
but
very
very
attenuated
body
is
lighter
and
mothfeel
is
a
little
on
the
thin
side
and
the
carbonation
is
reasonably
easygoing
too
this
is
a
nice
wellexecuted
fruitvegetable
beer
and
id
say
so
especially
if
we
were
to
consider
it
more
of
an
amalgam
of
golden
ale
and
fruit
vegetable
beer
rather
than
an
apa
for
whatever
reason
this
bottle
is
striking
me
as
tastier
and
livelier
than
the
last
draght
i
had
of
the
summer
honey
so
either
the
recipe
has
changed
or
its
less
impressive
on
draught
improves
a
bit
asit
warms
but
no
doubt
goes
down
quite
well
on
the
cold
side
for
some
folks
is
there
a
touch
of
wheat
malt
in
this
one
at
any
rate
its
much
better
than
i
remember
it
from
the
many
times
ive
sampled
it
over
the
previous
five
or
six
years
a
solid
summer
quaffer
from
a
solid
craft
brewery
today
was
a
hot
one
over
90
and
yes
this
was
refreshing
but
there
are
many
other
summer
beers
that
are
better
a
boring
beer
that
tastes
like
a
coors
with
kicked
up
bitterness
levels
no
reason
to
ever
try
this
big
sky
delivers
a
beautifully
floral
gently
sweet
and
lightly
citrusy
golden
beer
in
their
summer
honey
ale
it
pours
a
deep
golden
body
with
an
orange
cast
beneath
a
frothy
head
of
bright
white
that
steadily
dwindles
to
a
cottony
surface
covering
and
thick
collar
rings
of
spotty
and
cragged
lace
are
left
behind
in
the
nose
its
lemony
over
some
malty
and
honeyish
sweetness
the
body
is
medium
with
a
decidedly
dextrinous
edge
and
its
crisp
on
the
palate
with
a
lightly
bristling
carbonation
the
flavor
is
loaded
with
honey
flavor
and
wheatish
malt
floral
hop
flavors
and
a
bit
of
lemon
zest
help
to
round
it
out
it
finishes
surprisingly
short
and
dry
given
the
amount
of
flavor
packed
into
each
sip
and
it
lingers
for
a
few
moments
with
a
combination
of
wheatish
malt
and
floral
hops
as
well
as
a
very
light
touch
of
pine
quite
a
nice
summer
ale
this
ones
perfect
for
a
wide
variety
of
events
and
i
could
easily
imagine
enjoying
this
at
a
ball
game
boating
a
backyard
bbq
fishing
trip
or
cool
evening
on
the
porch
worth
trying
there
are
too
many
amazing
big
sky
beers
id
rather
be
having
yes
this
is
better
than
any
other
refreshing
lawnmowever
macro
beer
due
to
its
honey
spiced
flavor
but
i
just
want
to
move
on
from
this
beer
this
is
a
good
summer
beer
maybe
excellent
very
refreshing
the
smell
brings
strong
honey
flavor
with
some
light
flower
scents
in
the
taste
pale
malts
start
things
off
while
honey
takes
over
part
way
through
and
lasts
through
the
finish
the
mouthfeel
is
fairly
light
while
drinkability
is
very
high
drinks
okay
i
prefer
the
crystal
ale
as
a
summer
time
libation
one
of
the
better
honey
beers
ive
had
still
a
bit
too
sweet
a
nice
summer
beer
not
too
heavy
but
complicated
enough
to
be
interesting
recommended
d
the
sweetness
of
the
honey
was
nice
and
the
bitterness
of
the
hops
offered
a
nice
balance
most
beers
that
add
honey
have
some
odd
fermented
honey
flavors
but
this
one
wasnt
bad
i
came
close
to
pouring
this
one
down
the
sink
its
just
too
sweet
and
the
sweetness
has
some
odd
characteristics
as
well
it
reminds
me
of
the
smell
of
overaged
beef
i
can
see
how
a
lot
of
folks
might
like
this
beer
but
i
think
ill
avoid
this
one
in
the
future
poured
from
bottle
into
pint
glass
a
light
transparent
yellow
color
with
2
finger
head
and
lots
of
carbonation
smell
is
slightly
sweet
with
grasshay
and
hops
scents
coming
through
as
well
taste
is
pretty
sweet
like
honey
with
a
very
light
hoppy
aftertaste
nothing
too
special
though
mouthfeel
is
nice
and
smooth
a
little
bit
on
the
flat
side
overall
this
is
a
pretty
decent
summer
ale
that
goes
down
easily
with
summer
honey
ale
big
sky
has
demonstrated
their
brewing
dexterity
by
keeping
three
balls
named
honey
hops
and
spices
in
the
air
at
the
same
time
theyve
come
up
with
an
excellent
summer
cooler
that
id
love
to
have
access
to
when
the
hot
weather
rolls
around
looks
like
about
15000
other
beers
crystal
clear
gold
colr
with
a
small
white
head
that
fades
to
almost
nothing
not
a
lot
in
the
nose
but
malt
and
honey
sweetness
and
a
little
spice
taste
is
very
nice
for
a
honey
ale
the
honey
is
there
and
makes
the
beer
sweet
but
enhances
the
malt
flavor
very
light
and
crisp
the
malt
and
honey
are
absolutely
at
perfect
levels
to
each
other
good
work
big
sky
you
have
made
the
best
honey
beer
i
have
ever
tasted
overall
impression
one
of
the
better
honey
beers
i
have
tried

i
wasnt
dissapointed
it
is
what
its
trying
to
be
a
bit
spicey
yet
sweet
almost
to
the
point
of
annoying
but
like
george

it
pulls
up

i
did
this
six
pack
in
tonight
and
would
like
another
in
my
book
thats
some
super
drinkability
far
from
a
big
beer
this
is
lawnmower
material
and
it
does
what
you
think
it
will
refresh
without
boring
you
a
nice
summer
seasonal
that
is
quite
drinkable
seemed
a
bit
more
like
a
cream
ale
than
an

me

i
could
swear
theres
some
wheat
in
here
nice
summer
ale
that
thankfully
is
not
just
another
american
pale
wheat
ale
its
pale
gold
with
a
big
creamy
head
good

looks
like
the
kind
of
beer
i
want
to
drink
after
mowing
the
lawn
doesnt
smell
too
much
a
little
bit
of
spiciness
but
tastes
great
the
scent
is
representative
of
the
flavor
a
very
easydrinking
beer
with
a
bit
of
spice
excellent
and
refreshing
on
this
particular
day
drinkability
all
in
all
a
great
beer
with
different
and
great
flavors
this
may
take
over
my
top
montana
beer
the
beer
pours
a
pale
gold
color
with
a
thick
frothy
white
head
that
slowly
fades
to
lacing
the
aroma
is
good
it
has
a
pale
and
bisquit
malt
scent
with
some
honey
notes
and
a
musty
breadlike
finish
the
taste
is
excellent
it
has
a
very
smooth
pale
and
bisquit
malt
flavor
that
is
slightly
sweet
and
very
drinkable
it
goes
down
easy
and
finishes
spicey
and
breadlike
the
mouthfeel
is
good
it
is
a
medium
bodied
beer
with
adequate
carbonation
this
is
a
damn
fine
summer
seasonal
it
has
real
good
flavor
and
aroma
a
good
drinker
this
is
a
perfectly
drinkable
beer
though
its
nothing
fantastic
im
just
not
a
fan
of
honey
beers
it
was
quite
good
at
the
price
i
got
it
at
but
im
not
sure
id
seek
it
out
and
pay
actual
money
for
it
i
recommend
this
for
the
people
in
your
lives
who
dont
understand
why
you
like
beer
so
much
it
may
help
them
quite
a
drinkable
honey
beer
a
lighht
golden
brew
with
white
head
aromas
of
honey
and
light
grassy
hops
and
bready
yeast
but
nothing
special
it
has
a
light
refreshing
body
holding
bready
malt
and
yeast
flavors
with
a
good
malt
backbone
it
finishes
with
a
toasted
malt
and
lightly
honey
flavors
a
nice
summer
beer
the
bitterness
and
sweetness
is
well
balanced
in
this
ale
a
different
taste
that
just
made
it
interesting
and
worth
trying

big

has
done
a

with
this

ale
perfect
for
a
hot

with
both
sweet
tones
and
hop
flavors
color
is
just
like
honey
not
much
head
even
though
it
is
over
corbonated
which
is
why
i
gave
it
lower
score
on
mouthfeel
the
carbonation
burn
detracts
from
the
flavor
so
i
just
swirl
it
a
bit
until
the
carbonation
is
released
some
a
bit
pricey
for
a
lighter
beer
so
i
wait
for
it
on

the

nice

echoes
the
smell
with
a
nice

sugary
taste
with
sweet
honey
and
a
bit
of
hops
showing
up
with
a
very
slight

that
together
keeps
this
nicely

this

and
very
drinkable
in
my
book
i
think
i
have
a
new
summer
brew
to
add
to
my
list
this
summer

a

but
thats
not
what
theyre
going
for
an
excellent

refreshment
for
a

to

has
some

qualities
in

theres
a
little
midmouth
interest
in
this
brew
but
it
doesnt
redeem
the
wandering
finish
of
sweetsourweird
to
my
tongue
big
sky
brewing
is
a
real
puzzler
to
me
high
variation
in
quality
in
their
brews
this
clear
light
golden
brew
throws
out
a
medium
white
head
with
little
retention
beautiful
sweet
clover
honey
is
present
on
the
nose
with
some
light
spicing
perceived
also
cinamon
this
is
really
a
nice
tasting
summer
brew
the
honey
is
evident
as
well
as
some
wheat
malt
it
seems
theres
a
nice
little
hop
bite
its
light
to
medium
in
body
and
glides
over
the
tongue
effortlessly
there
is
also
a
very
nice
dryness
present
throughout
the
drink
but
moreso
on
the
finish
one
of
my
favorite
quaffable
summer
beers
not
bad
at
all
id
take
it
over
leinies
honey
any
day
of
the
week
ive
got
three
more
of
these
and
may
adjust
this
rating
as
i
drink
them
but
my
first
impression
is
pretty
good
interesting
light
somewhat
spicey
aroma
with
a
honey
sweetness
and
slight
fruitiness
to
it
very
clear
yellowish
gold
color
fizzy
head
with
a
relatively
short
life
fairly
bland
flavor
the
qualities
that
make
the
aroma
pleasing
dont
transfer
that
well
into
the
flavor
fairly
dry
over
all
has
a
somewhat
refreshing
quality
to
it
to
make
it
an
appropriate
seasonal
beer
for
summer
somewhat
full
mouthfeel
and
a
good
amount
of
carbonation
nice
goldorange
color
but
unfortunately
for
me
the
beer
quality
did
not
match
its
appearance
honey
sweet
with
citrus
undertones
and
a
medium
leaning
towards
the
light

subtle
hints
of

refreshing
and
really
good
for

found
this
in
my
basement
been
in
there
for
a
year
a
summer
ale
beer
that
i
would
drink
again
a
strong
yellow
in
color
not
a
weak
yellow
water
down
color
but
a
beer
that
i
could
enjoy
in
the
summer
i
cant
get
it
here
but
i
will
be
looking
a
beer
to
enjoy
with
friends
its
lightbodied
as
it
should
be
with
a
softer
crispness
that
while
constant
gives
preference
to
smoothness
a
little
leaf
dries
it
out
but
it
never
leaves
the
area
between
semidry
and
semisweet
httpwww

comkajiisbeerreviews
overall
pretty
crisp
little
summer
ale
here
no
frills
no
thrills
but
a
decent
light
option
for
outdoor
activities
in
the
summer
i
consider
blue
point
to
be
local
beer
company
and
i
am
a
big
east
coast
beer
drinker
o
bmc
missed
out
because
this
is
the
light
drinkable
everyday
beer
that
they
claim
to
make
the
difference
is
that
bluepoint
summer
ale
is
good
for
real
p
s
i
drank
this
all
summer
long
right
from
the
can
now
on
the
first
day
of
fall
i
poured
one
into
a
pint
glass
for
the
review
good
stuff
overall
this
is
a
good
beer
nice
and
crisp
draught
headkeeper
this
one
pours
a
clear
golden
color
there
was
almost
no
head
and
no
lacing
on
mine
the
aroma
is
lighter
but
still
nice
faint
malts
a
hint
of
fruit
and
floral
notes
the
taste
is
nice
hint
of
sweetness
faint
fruits
and
some
malts
nice
and
refreshing
cheers
o
nothing
mind
blowing
but
a
good

overall
a
decent
but
unremarkable
spiced

blonde
ale
thanks
to
the
creator
of
the
can

for
this
beer

with
a

is
malty
sweet
taste
is
very
mild
some
light
malts
a
touch
of
floral
hops
feels
medium
bodied
in
the
mouth
and
overall
is
a
mediocre
beer
overall
the
neutral
flavor
and
mouthfeel
make
this
for
an
easy
beverage
to
down
immediately
in
90
degree
heat
other
than
that
i
wouldnt
reach
for
this
again
light
gold

a

overall
the

rvealed

another

and
the
glug
initiaally
filled
my

with

until
i
backed
off
the

were
extremely
fizzy
causing
it
to
diminish
in
a
hurry
color
was
a
deep

with
nequality

and
lots
of
co2
bubbles
in
evidence
a
fizzy
yellow
beer
and
mr
koch
may
eat
his
heart
out
nose
had
a
soft
maltiness
along
with
a
lagerlike
honey
scent
interesting
mouthfeel
was
slightly
thin
but
the
taste
was
lightly
malty
with
a
honey
undertone
on
the
tongue
finish
was
semidry
and
refreshing
but
somehow
i
felt
as
though
it
were
lacking
something
it
was
kind
of
an
underwhelming
beer
i
would
look
for
something
else
for
the
summer
from
a
12
fl
oz
bottle
sampled
on
june
30
2012
the
pour
was
golden
yellow
with
a
thin
fizzy
white
head
slow
moving
carbonation
and
a
slight
chill
haze
the
aroma
was
your
basic
toasted
pale
malts
with
a
clean
and
crisp
hop
note
in
the
background
the
body
was
summer
light
while
the
taste
had
a
pleasant
enough
pale
malt
character
i
was
expecting
more
of
a
citrus
zest
in
there
as
well
low
bitterness
it
was
drinkable
on
the
87
degree
day
on
which
i
tried
it
out
a
decent
summer
thirst
quencher
but
im
not
inclined
to
buy
it
again
odpretty
bland
not
happy
with
a
sixpack
purchase
another
snoozer
in
a
long
line
of
summer
bores
easy
to
gulp
down
but
doesnt
impress
at
all
pours
a
beautiful
pale
crystal
clear
yellow
with
full
white
long
lasting
head
nice
scent
of
citrus
and
sweetgrass
taste
is
clean
and
crisp
just
what
i
want
in
a
summer
brew
really
refreshing
no
hoppy
aftertaste
or
bitterness
a
great
more
than
one
choice
great
alternative
to
a
macro
lager
highly
drinkable
without
that
macro
veggie
taste
good
for
a
rather
bland
style
o
refreshing
very
easy
to
drink
and
quite
sessionable
not
the
most
interesting
flavored
beer
but
it
is
very
light
and
refreshing
for
a
hot
summer
day
overall
at
first
glance
i
wasnt
expecting
much
out
of
this
beer
and
sorry
to
say
blue
point
i
was
right
very
bland
flavor
and
nothing
shot
out
at
me
with
anything
new
a
beer
i
maybe
might
recommend
to
someone
who
is
just
starting
out
drinking
new
and
exciting
beers
but
something
i
cant
drink
all
around
let
alone
in
the
summer
overall
quaffability
is
key
here
this
is
definitely
something
i
could
drink
throughout
a
warm
summers
day
not
much
going
on
which
ive
come
to
expect
from
summer
ales
but
this
is
as
flat
flavorwise
as
they
come
nothing
stands
out
i
will
forget
about
this
beer
by
tomorrow
if
you
want
an
easy
drinking
take
to
the
beachcookout
warm
day
playing
frisbee
beer
this
will
definitely
fit
the
bill
overall
this
is
really
just
a
seasonal
purchase
and
the
price
was
right
mix
and
match
of
9
99
but
if
i
ever
need
a
summer
ale
this
one
would
be
purchased
again
might
or
might
not
be
a
small
step
up
from
bmc
pass
on
this
one
every
time
2
5
worth
a
shot
if
youre
not
big
on
microbrews
overall
an
easy
drinking
but
ultimately
forgettable
blonde
top
five
summer
beers
in
my
opinion
a
very
fullflavored
yet
easydrinking
crisp
summer
brew
a
perfect
companion
to
a
hot
summer
day
bbq
on
a
rooftop
in
new
york
city
i
love
when
a
brewery
finds
a
winning
recipe
and
sticks
with
it
there
is
no
need
to
fix
what
aint
broken
o
starts
bright
and
ends
relatively
clean
overall
this
is
a
rather
weak
beer
forgettable
all
around
o
kind
of
upset
i
discovered
this
at
the
end
of
the
summer
really
enjoyed
this
one
pours
a
warm
yelloworange
color
with
a
thin
creamcolored
head
the
aroma
features
a
faint
combination
of
light
lemony
wheat
characteristics
and
a
slight
citric
tartness
the
flavor
is
likewise
light
with
a
mild
fruitiness
that
seems
like
some
combination
of
banana
and
orange
the
texture
is
light
and
fizzy
which
works
with
the
mild
flavors
overall
this
one
is
a
pleasant
easy
beer
that
is
appropriate
for
the
heat
of
summer
but
there
is
nothing
that
stands
out
among
other
mild
summer
offerings
this
is
a
great
summer
brew
and
was
a
very
pelasant
surprise
i
really
like
the
honey
aspect
of
this
beer
o
overall
i
found
this
beer
to
be
something
to
bring
to
a
party
to
add
to
the
beer
selection
its
not
too
heavy
so
it
wont
fill
you
and
it
will
satisfy
a
lager
drinker
becuase
it
doesnt
have
that
heavy
ale
feel
gold
colored
beer
with
a
rapidly
fading
head
aroma
is
dominated
by
bread
taste
is
bread
and
florals
overall
a
decent
beer
that
will
not
wow
you
or
sicken
you
kind
of
a
run
of
the
mill
flavor
i
personally
would
not
buy
again
but
would
recommend
to
try
once
not
bad
nothing
special
though
much
better
options
out
there
o
glad
i
tried
but
dont
need
it
again
not
a
fan
of
overly
malty
beers
and
that
is
what
this
is
too
much
so
at
a
lowly
4
4
summer
is
here
and
this
is
a
good
ale
overall
its
a
pretty
good
beer
nothing
too
special
but
nice
when
thirsty
on
a
hot
day
mouthfeel
is
average
with
average
carbonation
overall
this
is
a
decent
summer
offering
but
there
are
many
other
which
a
much
more
flavorful
profile
which
are
just
as
readily
available
and
just
as
sessionable
no
need
to
revist
here
d
a
pretty
standard
light
ale
that
could
double
for
just
about
any
yellow
fizzy
beer
the
aroma
is
pretty
nice
with
a
light
note
of
malt
and
some
pleasant
herbal
hop
characteristics
that
are
together
reminiscent
of
the
better
international
light
lagers
the
flavor
is
considerably
more
bland
as
it
possess
only
shadows
of
the
character
hinted
at
by
the
aroma
and
there
is
very
little
to
taste
by
the
finish
not
bad
in
any
specific
way
just
very
bland
and
unremarkable
not
over
the
top
not
a
top
rated
one
but
good
and
enjoyable
and
at
this
time
of
the
year
thats
pretty
good
o
not
bad
but
i
like
my
summer
ales
with
a
little
more
wheatish
flavor
and
dry
feel
this
brew
is
a
clear
golden
color
with
huge
apparent
carbonation
and
a
fairly
huge
head
it
doesnt
retain
for
too
long
though
the
aroma
is
a
bit
off
bit
citrus
grains
and
overripe
fruit
the
fruit
is
the
part
that
gets
to
me
it
just
doesnt
smell
that
great
this
bad
boy
tastes
a
lot
better
than
it
smells
though
comes
in
lemony
and
grainy
at
first
then
some
other
citrus
flavors
come
in
along
with
some
solid
wheatiness
to
pair
with
the
grains
on
the
finish
aftertaste
is
dry
and
wheaty
the
mouthfeel
is
nice
its
light
and
gets
a
bit
drying
towards
the
end
and
the
drinkability
is
fairly
good
a
good
enjoyable
summer
ale
nothing
more
d
definitely
a
beer
for
someone
who
just
wants
to
keep
on
drinking
i
found
it
bland
with
no
taste
that
made
you
want
to
come
back
for
more
i
would
steer
clear
from
it
overall
not
a
trailblazing
beer
by
any
means
but
still
a
very
clean
and
crisp
refreshing
summer
ale
its
extremely
drinkable
and
would
work
well
as
a
camping
brew
overall
decent
and
not
how
i
remember
it
bigger
and
more
flavorful
than
i
remember
it
being
which
is
good
but
i
wonder
if
it
isnt
missing
the
aim
of
being
a
summer
beer
still
im
sure
ill
end
up
drinking
lots
of
these
by
the
time
labor
day
rolls
around
cheers
the
first
notes
coming
through
were
of
the
grain
and
bready
like
tones
cereal
grains
which
were
present
right
away
in
front
of
you
were
now
taking
center
stage
soon
though
some
subtle
hints
would
start
to
come
out
as
well
a
nice
subtle
touch
of
banana
was
apparent
as
was
the
slightest
little
bit
of
a
hop
note
it
was
hard
to
discern
what
kind
as
it
was
very
subtle
but
i
would
guess
a
little
citrus
or
fresh
grass
flavor
not
very
heavy
and
just
more
of
background
lightness
then
anything
else
predictably
the
first
flavor
that
came
through
was
the
grain
notes
that
were
so
prevalent
in
the
aroma
but
quickly
these
faded
or
rather
mingles
in
with
some
light
fruit
notes
some
yeast
showing
their
muscle
giving
me
hints
of
banana
some
light
lemon
almost
very
nice
with
a
little
bit
of
a
kick
the
kick
probably
coming
from
a
little
bit
of
the
hops
that
were
poking
their
head
around
in
there
light
grass
now
mixing
in
as
a
summer
ale
that
is
suppossed
to
be
drinkable
this
is
just
do
not
expect
to
be
blown
away
by
any
taste
pours
a
light
straw
color
no
head
no
lacing
smells
of
some
citrus
but
little
of
anything
else
tastes
pretty
bland
has
some
lemon
notes
and
is
more
bitter
than
i
would
have
thought
mouthfeel
is
that
of
a
light
lager
and
it
drinks
like
one
as
well
bottom
line
pretty
average
md
medium
bodied
with
good
carbonation
overall
a
pass
all
in
all
this
kind
of
sucks
not
worth
your
time
or
effort
dont
bother
hunting
or
trying
d
i
really
enjoyed
this
one
it
hit
the
spot
my
first
sip
of
this
beer
was
too
reminiscent
of
mass
produced
american
beers
i
felt
that
though
this
is
a
blonde
ale
it
should
have
been
a
bit
more
substantial
the
flavor
notes
of
hops
was
apparent
but
not
as
strong
as
i
would
like
maybe
this
isnt
the
style
for
me
but
overall
i
did
not
believe
it
was
very
good
twelve
ounce
bottle
pours
a
clear
light
golden
body
with
a
two
finger
offwhite
head
retention
is
average
and
there
are
some
curtains
of
patchy
lace
on
the
glass
aroma
has
hints
of
twangy
wheat
malt
and
lemon
zest
but
mostly
biscuity
scents
just
a
faint
note
of
grassy
hops
light
body
is
nicely
carbonated
taste
has
a
subdued
sweetness
that
goes
well
with
the
biscuity
pale
maltiness
lemon
zest
a
faint
note
of
grassy
hop
bitterness
and
an
aspirin
note
comprise
most
of
the
flavor
profile
finishes
clean
and
crisp
not
bad
but
far
from
my
favorite
for
a
summer
ale
this
is
a
tasty
crowdpleasing
summer
ale
its
refreshing
enough
to
drink
on
its
own
on
a
summer
afternoon
but
its
also
light
enough
to
pair
well
with
a
flavorful
summer
meal
i
dont
think
you
can
really
go
wrong
with
this
beer
and
i
would
definitely
get
it
for
a
bbq
or
dinner
party
disappointing
just
kind
of
bland
with
a
few
off
flavors
easy
to
drink
and
worth
your
time
good
summer
brew
d
the
beer
is
somewhat
refreshing
and
thirst
quenching
although
the
taste
isnt
very
interesting
its
not
a
bad
choice
if
youre
looking
for
a
light
beer
on
a
hot
summer
day
i
think
this
beer
is
a
solid
example
of
a
quality
blonde
ale
the
beer
pours
a
translucent
cornfield
yellow
it
has
a
good
two
fingers
of
head
that
dissipate
quickly
limited
lacing
present
as
the
beer
is
appreciatively
quaffed
not
a
whole
lot
comming
through
in
the
nose
faint
hop
present
and
slight
lemon
citrus
taste
is
frankly
watery
there
is
as
in
the
nose
a
slight
bitter
finish
malt
presence
equally
subtle
the
beer
is
well
carbonated
and
it
suits
its
mild
taste
this
beer
is
very
drinkable
could
have
several
of
these
without
problem
however
there
isnt
enough
going
on
for
me
to
reach
for
it
over
other
excellent
summer
beers
really
only
slightly
better
than
many
bmc
products
fine
to
have
on
a
hot
summer
day
to
quench
ones
thirst
but
beyond
that
simply
average
for
a
summer
ale
i
would
expect
a
lighter
feel
with
more
carbonation
this
might
be
past
its
best
by
date
so
some
carbonation
may
have
been
lost
overall
it
would
make
a
good
summer
beer
d
not
offensively
bad
and
undrinkable
but
just
terribly
average
poured
a
very
light
yellow
with
good
carbonation
and
almost
no
head
aside
from
some
very
subtle
herbs
the
nose
had
nothing
ditto
the
taste
i
understand
that
lawnmower
beers
are
supposed
to
be
light
but
this
one
was
almost
begging
me
to
add
some
flavor
in
the
form
of
a
citrus
slice
the
mouthfeel
was
slightly
above
average
given
the
carbonation
overall
i
was
sincerely
disappointed
with
this
specimen
a
the
color
of
wet
straw
thin
layer
of
tightly
packed
head

s
a
light

on
the
nose

t

on

end

the
beer
otherwise

steps
forward

somewhat

doughy
taste

wow
wee
about
it
and
there
are
other
session
beers
i
would
reach
for
first
a
great
summer
brewi
can
and
will
have
this
beer
again
very
refreshing
in
the
hot
humid
summer
days
pours
a
bubbly
clear
gold
with
an
initially
billowing
head
that
quickly
dissipates
into
nothingness
sweet
graininess
on
the
nose
taste
is
ordinary
unimpressive
but
not
offensive
lightly
sweet
malts
without
much
in
the
way
of
hops
to
back
them
up
watery
body
is
its
biggest
drawback
blue
point
has
better
beers
in
its
lineup
ill
not
have
this
one
again
an
okay
blonde
ale
probably
good
for
outdoors
in
a
barbque
do
a
decent
summertime
refresher
but
nothing
too
terribly
interesting
going
on
would
work
well
with
a
variety
of
summer
foods
probably
good
at
parties
with
noncraft
beer
drinkers
but
there
are
better
options
out
there
in
the
style
d
not
bad
goes
down
nicely
with
little
aftertaste
d
this
beer
goes
down
very
easy
and
hits
the
spot
on
a
hot
summer
day
nothing
really
stands
out
but
it
all
works
well
d
one
of
the
easiest
drinking
beers
ive
had
this
year
not
loaded
with
flavor
and
aromas
but
a
very
drinkable
beer
i
was
pretty
disappointed
with
this
beer
i
know
summer
beers
tend
to
be
lighter
but
this
one
was
bland
and
lacked
the
crispness
that
makes
a
beer
like
this
refreshing
pours
a
perfectly
clear
straw
with
a
small
head
its
exactly
what
it
intends
to
be
a
light
easydrinking
ale
for
hot
summer
days
lemon
is
present
in
both
the
nose
and
taste
slight
cooked
cornveggie
in
the
aftertaste
pretty
clean
and
crisp
would
make
a
great
session
on
a
summer
afternoon
pours
with
small
fizzy
white
head
that
bubbles
down
to
nothing
making
the
glass
appear
to
be
filled
with
apple
juice
fruity
malty
sweet
nose
sugary
with
a
little
bit
of
mint
aroma
tangy
in
flavor
and
slightly
alive
with
small
bubbles
that
coat
the
tongue
the
fruit
flavors
are
pretty
refreshing
at
first
but
become
boring
over
done
and
far
too
sweet
id
like
some
bitterness
some
crispness
this
is
almost
juicelike
in
body
syrupy
and
coating
one
dimensional
in
flavor
i
dont
necessarily
care
for
it
slight
bit
of
body
from
the
wheat
but
the
bad
taste
seems
to
dominate
any
positive
mouthfeel

beer
md
i
find
this
beer
very
drinkable
but
only
because
there
isnt
much
to
it
i
wouldnt
seek
it
out
to
buy
myself
but
if
offered
it
i
would
definitely
not
say
no
overallwould
drink
again
though
i
wouldnt
seek
it
out
taste
is
a
malt
front
with
a
nice
citrus
back
and
some
good
balance
to
it
i
like
that
this
beer
is
not
trying
to
be
too
much
of
anything
it
doesnt
overwhelm
but
it
doesnt
underwhelm
either
its
very
sessionable
with
a
low
abv
and
a
good
crisp
finish
and
mouthfeel
that
is
good
for
the
warmer
weather
months
im
going
to
go
back
for
a
second
to
see
if
anything
else
comes
out
im
on
my
second
one
and
maybe
there
is
a
cracked
graininess
that
is
coming
through
in
the
body
this
beer
is
just
ultra
smooth
and
not
much
there
there
the
finish
is
just
watery
emptiness
the
aftertaste
is
slightly
soapy
to
non
existent
the
mouthfeel
is
watery
and
a
tad
bit
drying
on
the
tongue
this
is
an
entirely
refreshing
empty
and
forgettable
beer
not
worth
spending
anymore
words
on
light
bodied
medium
carbonation
the
finish
again
to
me
tastes
only
of
water
and
thats
not
going
to
make
me
want
have
another
bottle
for
sure
this
one
i
cannot
recomend
d
this
ones
just
not
working
needs
some
carbonation
or
a
pop
of
flavor
to
be
a
refreshing
summer
brew
i
would
pass
on
this
one
again
as
there
are
more
interesting
summer
styles
to
be
had
out
there
not
citrusy
or
hoppy
enough
to
be
an
adventurous
outing
but
one
thats
satisfying
no
less
overallnot
offensively
bad
but
not
great
blue
point
based
on
my
tastings
makes
good
beer
but
this
isnt
great
really
watery
and
nothing
notable
still
fine
on
a
hot
day
pay
for
it
again
i
will
not
somewhat
drinkable
as
there
is
a
crispness
but
it
also
has
a
watery
thinness
overall
its
too
shallow
not
a
fan
of
whats
going
on
here
better
summer
thirstquenchers
out
there
imo
i
was
drinking
this
out
of
the
keg
while
fishing
saturday
night
this
beer
pours
darker
than
your
average
summer
ale
in
my
opinion
with
a
slight
white
head
the
smell
is
feint
but
what
i
get
is
citrus
the
flavor
is
nice
i
mean
its
a
summer
ale
not
a
dipa
like
i
usually
drink
but
it
has
nice
flavor
and
is
extremely
drinkable
the
flavor
has
a
mild
hint
of
nuts
and
citrus
the
mouthfeel
is
very
pleasant
and
its
certainly
something
that
can
be
drank
all
night
a
summer
beer
nothing
incredibly
out
of
the
ordinary
easy
drinking
pours
a
nice
golden
color
with
a
nice
white
head
that
leaves
a
thin
lace
on
the
beer
smells
very
grainy
with
a
hint
of
citrus
and
malt
their
is
more
citrus
appearance
in
the
taste
with
the
grain
their
is
a
slight
taste
of
hops
in
the
nose
and
finishes
nice
and
dry
this
is
a
nice
summer
time
beer
and
easy
to
drink
i
will
probably
look
for
this
one
again
pours
a
transparent
gold
the
aroma
is
grainy
and
intense
with
a
nice
dose
of
flowery
hopes
the
flavor
follows
suits
with
a
nice
grain
good
flowery
hop
character
and
a
sly
bitterness
that
comes
in
on
the
back
end
this
has
a
thin
refreshing
mouthfeel
not
a
trailblazer
but
a
good
summertime
drinker
the
mouth
feel
is
light
which
is
expected
for
a
summer
ale
this
is
on
my
list
of
must
haves
during
the
summer
as
it
is
light
and
refreshing
i
really
like
that
it
doesnt
have
the
heavy
citrus
flavor
that
a
lot
of
summer
brews
have
its
a
must
try
for
those
that
like
the
summer
seasonals
pours
a
very
nice
golden
yellow
color
nice
carbonation
nice
twofinger
fizzy
white
head
which
leaves
some
sticky
lacing
behind
the
nose
is
malty
slight
hops
with
lots
of
caramel
the
taste
is
malty
slightly
sweet
grapefruit
with
some
caramel
medium
body
drinkable
a
nice
thirst
quencher
mouthfeel
i
really
like
this
starts
off
like
a
light
ale
but
the
hops
come
back
for
the
finish
almost
like
a
pale
ale
that
is
weak
or
a
summer
brew
that
got
a
heavier
dose
of
hops
thirst
quenching
and
i
was
pleasantly
surprised
by
the
hoppier
flavors
the
growler
claimed
this
bew
has
another
unnamed
ingredient
aside
from
the
lemon
citruscardamom
maybe
pours
a
clear
golden
color
with
little
bubbles
going
up
the
glass
there
is
a
one
finger
white
head
that
dissipates
quickly
leaving
no
lacing
wheat
malt
and
lemon
aromas
are
well
balanced
up
front
flavors
of
toasted
malt
with
the
wheat
and
lemon
following
up
not
very
complex
flavors
but
well
balanced
light
body
medium
carbonation
this
is
a
smooth
easy
drinking
summer
ale
not
to
much
to
it
but
enough
to
let
you
know
you
are
drinking
a
craft
beer
pale
gold
with
ashort
tan
head
the
aroma
gives
off
hints
of
creamy
diacetyl
in
a
good
way
and
mellow
bready
grains
the
flavor
is
pretty
mild
but
it
has
the
same
salty
and
astringent
aftertaste
that
i
didnt
like
with
the
toasted
lager
its
almost
chaulky
in
the
aftertaste
and
that
pretty
much
ruins
this
one
for
me
this
ones
headed
for
the
drain
im
not
usually
a
big
buyerdrinker
of
summer
style
brews
but
when
i
get
the
urge
for
one
this
wouldnt
be
a
bad
choice
d
overall
a
refreshing
and
enjoyable
summer
brew
that
is
good
all
summer
long
again
was
able
to
pick
this
up
at
community
beverage
in
queens
which
has
a
wonderful
selection
of
blue
point
brews
very
light
summery
drink
with
not
much
flavor
to
it
its
far
from
being
watered
down
but
if
its
going
to
be
called
a
summer
ale
you
would
expect
more
citrus
kick
to
it
very
small
citrus
hints
with
a
crisp
clean
feel
not
that
the
lack
of
citrus
was
its
downfall
but
it
was
a
bit
surprising
to
read
the
label
and
then
taste
it
overall
smooth
and
refreshing
but
not
spectacular
in
flavor
dvery
drinkable
on
a
summer
day
the
biscuits
dominate
the
pallate
i
prefer
the
brooklyn
summer
to
this
d
at
less
than
4
5
abv
this
is
one
heck
of
a
summer
session
beer
this
ale
is
quite
refreshing
for
a
hot
summer
day
it
has
just
enough
flavor
without
that
heavy
citrusy
taste
to
keep
it
interesting
notes
i
see
this
is
considered
an
american
pale
ale
but
it
seems
to
be
more
of
a
wheat
beer
in
a
lot
of
ways
or
maybe
like

light
with

to
make
you
want
to
keep
drinking
a
very
solid
summer
ale
poured
a
bottle
of
it
into
a
glass
mug
the
beer
poured
a
light
gold
colored
body
with
a
very
small
head
and
poor
retention
decent
lacing
afterwards
the
smell
was
fairly
malty
with
a
sweet
undertone
the
taste
was
very
smooth
it
was
a
nice
mix
of
sweet
and
bitter
tastes
with
a
sweet
aftertaste
that
was
honeylike
the
mouthfeel
was
pretty
thin
but
that
is
expected
of
a
summer
ale
the
beer
was
very
drinkable
tasted
good
had
a
light
body
and
was
very

really

overall
some
would
say
bland
but
thats
not
really
the
case
here
flavors
a
clean
drinking
ale
with
some
citrus
and
pine
hop
flavors
with
a
clean
malt
sweetness
again
a
refreshing
clean

with
enough

to
keep
most
interested
im
really
a
fan
definitely
easy
drinking
mouthfeel
is
light
bodied
even
carbonation
even
a
bit
watery
but
to
hell
with
the
texure
this
beer
pulls
of
light
beer
with
flavor
presence
drinkability
is
high
i
could
down
a
few
of
these
without
overthinking
it
im
a
fan
of
blue
point
beers
that
ive
tried
this
is
no
different
great
stuff
for
the
summer
visit
to
the
long
island
brewery
taste
is
somewhat
sweet
with
biting
earthy
hops
and
very
subtle
hints
of
citrus
id
think
they
would
want
to
expose
the
citrus
element
more
since
this
is
a
summer
ale
still
this
is
a
quality
ale
from
blue
point
something
i
would
have
again
and
would
recommend
to
anyone
looking
for
a
solid
session
beer
d
the
tastiness
is
a
little
lacking
but
it
goes
down
easy
nottoofilling
ive
definitely
had
better
in
the
style
and
quite
frankly
i
was
a
little
disappointed
based
on
what
ive
come
to
expect
from
bluepoint
brewing
poured
into
an
imperial

not
a

it

to

for
the

bighuge0
not
one
of
favorites
at
rr
this
should
be
graded
on
the
curve
the
scores
here
are
way
too
low
unfortunately
this
category
like
irish
reds
dont
reflect
a
true
mean
like
ipas
and
stouts
and
wild
ales
i
am
surprised
to
see
this
one
rated
so
low
of
all
the
non
sour
beers
at
russian
river
this
was
one
of
my
favorites
its
a
very
light
but
flavorful
blonde
ale
more
hoppy
than
most
with
a
great
citrus
finish
and
enough
body
to
not
come
through
watered
down
at
all
there
appears
to
be
some
wheat
in
here
too
a
nice
base
for
the
higher
hop
dose
carbonation
is
happy
and
the
finish
is
pretty
clean
touch
of
sweetness
there
makes
it
stick
i
dont
get
the
low
marks
its
a
great
blonde
ale
while
i
was
in
some
ways
unimpressed
by
the
base
beer
offerings
at
russian
river
i
though
this
one
was
a
success
definitely
different
from
the
crowd
very
nice

2
of
flight
of
all
at
the
brewery
on
tap
at
the
brewery
in
santa
rosa
yellow
color
i
guess
this
is
supposed
to
be
a
hoppy
blond
but
i
did
not
find
it
all
that
hoppy
in
fact
it
was
my
least
favorite
beer
at
russian
river
and
was
just
overall
very
boring
to
me
i
would
not
order
this
again
if
i
saw
it
on
tap
as
part
of
a
sampler
at
the
brewpub
pours
light
golden
with
a
creamy
white
head
the
nose
is
light
citrus
and
peach
notes
very
fruity
with
some
accompanying
hay
aroma
flavor
is
light
with
hay
grass
light
citrus
and
a
wheatlike
finish
that
is
just
a
tad
dirty
light
bodied
spritzy
carbonation
easy
going
very
easy
drinking
beer
that
is
worth
sucking
down
on
a
hot
day
its
dull
but
very
solid
i
guess
russian
river
cant
be
all
oakaged
wilds
and
hoppedup
insanity
o
overall
pretty
drinkable
but
they
have
some
many
good
beers
here
this
just
isnt
a
standout
good
one
to
start
with
on
the
sampler
though
dr
incredibly
drinkable
very
refreshing
well
priced
for
the
quality
among
the
best
blondes
ive
tried
insert
sex
joke
here
how
they
get
that
fresh
orange
note
in
there
puzzles
me
o
very
solid
i
just
had
to
try
it
when
i
could
o
this
is
not
usually
a
style
i
seek
out
but
really
enjoyed
this
brew
not
overly
complex
but
easy
to
drink
and
tasty
clean
and
simple
pale
malt
that
lends
a
little
sweetness
and
grainy
qualities
and
a
lightly
bitter
hop
to
balance
in
the
finish
lightly
nutty
impression
also
medium
bodied
with
a
generally
light
feel
something
easily
sessionable
and
pretty
accessible
to
most
beer
drinkers
golden
and
crystal
clear
with
a
small
white
head
nice
light
hop
aroma
with
a
mild
hop
flavor
that
hints
of
everything
thats
packed
into
the
bigger
rr
ipas
simple
but
very
refreshing
and
enjoyable
this
is
a
great
intro
beer
for
those
new
to
craft
beer
and
a
fantastic
session
option
this
is
a
decent
belgianamerican
blonde
ale
light
crisp
and
slightly
fruity
this
is
just
what
the
doctor
ordered
d
very
drinkable
the
balance
between
all
of
the
various
flavors
here
is
very
nice
with
out
feeling
empty
or
muddled
it
is
a
great
approachable
beer
for
new
craft
beer
drinkers
as
well
as
a
great
way
to
start
off
the
night
o
there
is
really
not
much
to
this
beer
but
more
importantly
there
isnt
anything
negative
about
this
beer
i
could
drink
this
all
day
and
never
get
tired
of
it
good
not
a
must
have
with
blonde
ales
you
can
expect
a
creative
coma
even
apparently
from
the
worlds
most
creative
brewers
blonde
ales
are
nothing
more
than
clean
moderately
malty
and
easygoing
there
are
far
more
interesting
offerings
at
russian
river
and
this
is
one
that
could
stand
to
be
spared
but
if
you
like
the
style
its
one
of
the
best
examples
youll
find
o
amazing
this
is
one
of
the
best
if
not
the
best
blonde
ales
ive
ever
had
though
for
a
blonde
this
is
seriously
hoppy
almost
on
the
pale
ale
level
though
without
the
grapefruitpine
character
of
most
apas
the
hops
provide
a
great
deal
of
complexity
and
the
majority
of
the
character
there
is
a
great
malt
counterpoint
as
well
overall
this
beer
is
very
well
put
together
taste
full
of
it
refreshing
lemon
slightly
bitter
hoppy
yet
easy
enough
to
pass
off
on
the
girlfriend
a
crowd
pleaser
probably
beer
geek
centric
or
not
a
little
spicy
as
if
some
rye
but
its
probably
the
yeast
drinkability
i
could
drink
a
few
of
these
with
a
nice
meal
had
this
on
tap
in
a
restaurant
in
santa
rosa
the
name
of
the
place
escapes
me
pours
a
pale
yellow
colour
with
thin
white
head
smells
quite
fruity
and
sweet
with
some
mild
hops
very
sweet
flavour
nicely
balanced
ale
big
carbonation
level
would
probably
prefer
it
toned
down
a
bit
a
pretty
nice
beer
on
tap
at
the
brewpub
the
color
could
be
described
as
blond
clarity
is
pretty
good
and
so
is
head
retention
the
nose
is
fairly
bland
largely
pale
malt
with
a
touch
of
honey
sweetness
and
straw
tastes
pretty
good
for
the
style
it
had
a
clean
pale
malt
profile
a
little
citrus
and
breadiness
theres
a
very
mild
and
clean
hop
bite
in
the
finish
solid
for
a
blonde
but
not
standout
in
russian
rivers
lineup
beer
is
light
in
body
and
has
a
nice
presence
on
the
palate
good
carbonation
midpalate
is
mostly
citrus
and
minimal
sweetness
up
front
it
tastes
really
nice
its
light
refreshing
its
sessionable
its
about
the
easiest
drinking
beer
ive
ever
had
obviously
not
my
favorite
rr
brew
but
its
totally
solid
taste
ill
admit
i
tried
this
as
a
lark
since
this
isnt
my
typical
beer
style
but
i
wanted
to
see
what
rr
could
do
crisp
light
and
fizzy
with
more
graininess
than
i
expected
some
underlying
hop
flavor
but
not
much
however
it
is
very
drinkable
though
id
likely
contend
that
its
too
drinkable
the
middle
is
more
of
the
same
very
grainy
with
an
underlying
rich
moist
edge
that
i
often
taste
in
some
german
lagers
finishes
very
clean
with
faint
hops
and
grain
notes
to
do
get
more
intense
as
it
warms
ill
give
this
a
b
since
im
rating
to
style
definitely
not
average
but
not
exciting
at

to
me

is

this

d
kind

this

pretty

beer

ive
only
seen
it
on

and
i
dont
go
to
bars
to
drink
light
stuff
i
guess
if
i
saw
it
on
a
really
hot
day
id
get
it
but
for
my
usual
pub
crawls
this
is
going
to
be
skipped
this
easy
drinking
style
is
quickly
overshadowed
and
forgotten
when
you
start
working
your
way
through
the

all
summer
pours
a

with
a

is
soft
and
citric
flavor
is
lightly
grainy
with
a
lemony
zing
and
a

mouthfeel
is
semidry
and
the
drinkability
is
off
the
charts
one
of
the
most
refreshing
beers
ive
had
the
taste
is
light
crisp
exceedingly
refreshing
and
very
smooth
but
full
of
flavour
and
subtle
complexity
it
tastes
of
grain
fruit
citrus
yeast
its
a
nicely
balanced
bittersweet
beer
with
a
faint
yeasty
sourness
lutrking
underneath
d
served
purpose
of
starting
off
the
day
very
easy
drinking
and
refreshing
nice
balance
between
slight
sweetness
and
hop
taste
but
nothing
overwhelming
i
would
probably
order
it
again
but
likely
as
a
leadin
to
something
else
got
this
on
tap
at
the
brewpub
in
santa
rosa
came
in
a
pint
glass
and
was
a
clear
yellow
with
a
minimal
head
as
are
many
pub
pours
nose
of
flowery
hops
and
mild
malts
good
clean
mouthfeel
nice
flavors
with
hops
sort
of
like
a
pils
nice
dry
finish
very
drinkable
d
very
high
on
the
drinkability
scale
i
put
down
a
bunch
of
these
at
my
buddys
wedding
with
ease
this
isnt
the
best
beer
that
russian
river
makes
but
its
quite
good
especially
for
the
style
very
drinkable
this
would
be
very
good
if
it
wasnt
on
the
same
menu
as
pliny
the
elder
blind
pig
damnation
salvation
perdition
and
compunction
i
wasnt
expecting
much
from
this
and
im
surprised
i
even
reviewed
it
i
dont
think
i
wouldve
if
it
hadnt
been
made
at
the
beer
mecca
russian
river
drinkability
on
a
hot
day
is
pretty
good
but
not
lot
to
keep
your
interest
the
smell
has
an
assertive
hop
presence
mostly
in
citrus
form
hops
also
come
through
strong
in
the
taste
from
the
front
all
the
way
through
malts
are
light
and
barely
present
in
the
face
of
those
hops
the
mouthfeel
is
light
while
drinkability
is
good
drinkability
certainly
one
of
the
most
flavorful
blondes
i
have
ever
had
overall
pretty
tasty
and
recommended
the
flavor
was
more
malty
than
hoppy
again
faint
easy
to
drink
and
could
be
sessionable
but
mostly
forgettable
to
me
compared
to
the
other
beers
from
russian
river
interestingly
there
was
no
sour
component
despite
a
lack
of
hops
to
cover
up
said
flavor
so
i
guess
they
have
good
control
over
their
brett
from
my
notes
on
recent
trip
this
beer
pours
a
light
golden
color
with
no
head
as
delivered
but
spotty
lacing
here
and
there
aroma
is
of
citrussy
lemons
and
a
slight
malt
floating
around
there
too
pretty
decent
taste
is
quite
nice
an
easily
drinkable
creamy
smooth
malt
and
lemon
cirtus
thats
fresh
and
refreshing
at
4
5
id
drink
this
all
night
long
overall
i
realized
that
it
was
an
american
blonde
ale
and
i
didnt
expect
a
lot
even
here
but
i
wanted
to
try
it
nonetheless
it
turns
out
that
this
was
very
good
yet
it
turned
out
to
be
the
least
favored
return
to
of
the
rrbc
beers
that
i
sampled
over
my
weekend
visit
simply
put
there
is
just
too
much
competition
still
this
is
a
solid
3
95
though
almost
a
4
0
says
a
lot
that
citrusy
very
easy
to
drink
what
a
summer
brew
should
be
wow
very
refreshing
better
than
i
expected
i
mean
its
widmer
ya
know
low
abv
but
refreshing
i
wonder
how
it
would
go
down
on
a
hot
lawnmower
saturday
afternoon
overall
i
will
return
to
this
beer
i
was
caught
offguard
by
its
balance
and
flavour
a
good
summer
beer
tropical
tangerine
fruity
aroma
and
flavor
with
light
malt
sweet
bready
the
aroma
is
really
nice
sweet
orange
malt
and
moderately
bitter
pinegrapefruit
peel
flavor
a
very
nice
beer
a
beer
i
would
love
to
have
again
recommend
this
highly
pouring
a
deeper
slightly
cloudy
gold
it
has
a
shortlasting
fizzy
white
head
a
miniscule
amount
hangs
on
and
leaves
some
lacing
the
aroma
is
almost
nonexistent
with
a
slight
funky
earthy
hops
and
malt
sweetness
to
it
the
taste
is
little
more
complex
than
the
aroma
there
is
a
light
hint
more
robust
malt
on
the
finish
i
cant
quite
identify
the
body
is
a
little
watery
and
thin
its
definitely
an
easy
drinker
but
it
just
hasnt
have
much
oomph
behind
it
in
the
flavor
department
o
refreshing
and
well
balance
although
i
would
have
preferred
more
citra
flavor
overall
very
refreshing
summer
beer
perfect
for
a
hot
day
nothing
over
the
top
but
a
very
well
balanced
beer
that
does
its
job
perfectly
pours
translucent
dirty
gold
with
a
ring
of
white
foam
malty
chalky
nose
a
little
citrus
taste
is
a
subtle
pale
almost
helles
backed
by
some
lemon
citrus
very
mild
and
even
flavorful
summer
brew
balanced
and
not
too
sweet
good
for
the
fourth
o
overall
while
i
wished
the
citra
hops
lasted
a
bit
longer
on
the
nose
this
did
follow
within
the
guidelines
per
style
of
an
american
blonde
nice
soft
dry
grain
base
bittering
more
typical
per
style
but
lightly
dry
a
body
that
was
a
bit
fuller
with
a
pretty
decent
rate
of
drinkability
while
not
a
big
fan
of
widmers
earlier
works
they
do
seem
to
be
progressing
final
thoughts
while
those
might
be
expecting
a
big
burst
of
tropical
citra
hops
this
is
more
focused
on
traditional
style
softly
dry
bittering
and
not
meant
to
be
an
ipa
overall
pretty
decent
per
style
o
theres
room
for
improvement
the
citra
hops
could
be
shown
off
better
and
it
could
also
use
less
of
a
carbonic
bite
but
its
nice
enough
in
its
current
state
give
me
a
six
pack
and
100
degree
weather
and
id
probably
think
of
this
in
a
much
better
light
it
certainly
beats
bmc
thats
for
damn
sure
wait
overall
for
a
profile
of
a
great
hop
this
beer
showcases
it
extremely
well
great
session
beer
and
i
believe
it
is
underrated
based
on
the
breweryno
need
to
be
pretentious
overall
its
pretty
refreshing
and
fits
the
description
of
a
blonde
ale
pretty
well
my
anxious
pour
netted
me
just
over
two
fingers
of
dense
bonewhite
head
with
very
good
retention
color
was
a
slightlyhazy
sunshine
yellow
srm

and
i
found
myself
wishing
for
the
return
of
warmer
weather
i
just
attended
my
30year
high
school
reunion
last
night
and
by
the
end
my
feet
and
right
knee
caused
me
to
have
to
sit
down
today
the
arthritis
in
my
hands
is
kicking
it
warmth
would
be
good
right
about
now
the
foam
fell
as
i
typed
leaving
beautiful
lacing
in
its
wake
i
plan
on
running
the
dishwasher
later
today
so
it
all
works
out
the
jackhammer
can
remain
in
the
basement
as
a
result
nose
was
citrusy
evocative
of
tangerines
or
mandarin
oranges
mouthfeel
was
light
not
thin
per
se
but
not
big
either
upon
tasting
it
i
definitely
stand
behind
tangerines
in
terms
of
taste
a
nice
breakfast
beer
although
i
have
already
eaten
breakfast
finish
was
semidry
and
this
would
make
an
excellent
lawnmower
beer
during
the
summertime
overall
this
is
probably
a
lot
better
fresh
citra
doesnt
seem
to
hold
up
very
well
under
too
many
months
on
the
shelf
but
if
you
could
find
this
fresh
itd
probably
be
one
hell
of
a
tasty
session
beer
poured
from
a
brown
12
oz
bottle
has
a
cloudy
yellowish
color
with
a
12
inch
head
smell
is
surprisingly
hoppy
some
citrus
notes
as
well
taste
is
well
balanced
hops
and
malts
a
bit
minty
some
citrus
very
easy
drinking
feels
medium
bodied
in
the
mouth
and
overall
is
a
refreshing
summer
brew
overall
this
is
a
tasty
little
brew
if
you
want
a
summer
session
brew
with
some
flavor
this
would
be
a
good
one
to
go
with
pours
with
a
foamy
white
head
that
leaves
a
great
web
of
lacing
on
the
glass
aroma
is
pungent
skunky
hop
goodness
not
sure
if
i
get
citrus
from
citra
the
scent
seems
more
musk
to
me
i
can
see
why
people
say
catpee
and
somewhat
sweet
so
to
style
its
really
quite
good

unfairly
low
ratings
for
this
beer
here
i
admit
a
lot
of
their
strong
and
belgian
styles
have
been
lackluster
but
this
is
a
pretty
good
summer
ale
certainly
a
good
one
to
buy
a
case
of
in
a

state

for
hot

mass
consumption
pale
blonde
in
color
bubbly
and
emitting

of

and
extremely

the
flavor
is

with

and
then
a
clean
slightly
citrusy
balanced
finish
crispy
clean
drinking
supremely
refreshing
and
with
the
low

its
a

slammer
right
from

i
think
it
probably
deserves
a
little
more
credit
than
it
has
on
here
i
mean
there
are
no
off
flavors
and
the
feel
is
great
i
guess
folks
may
be
looking
for
a
bit
more
hop
character
or
even
just
more
robust
flavors
throughout
but
this
beer
is
for
the
light
beer
drinker
looking
to
go
craft
i
think
it
works
and
aside
from
being
awfully
light
ive
got
no
real
critiques
i
like
the
biscuity
front

and
the
hint
of

o
this
beer
is
easy

and
light
enough
and
low
enough
in

to
be
quite

there
is
nothing
that
really
stands
out
about
this
beer
but
it
is
enjoyable
overall
good
clean
summer
drink
not
a
big
flavor
or
at
all
challenging
overall
a
quaffable
summer
ale
o
the
light
body
nature
of
this
beer
makes
it
go
down
easily
but
theres
nothing
special
about
the
smell
or
taste
overall
this
is
a
subpar
attempt
at
a
blonde
ale
flavor
profile
is
muted
and
seems
dialed
back
not
horrible
but
there
were
much
better
options
that
i
passed
up

wont
make

this

to

it
does
add

twist
to
things
nothing
crazy

decent
for
a
standard
american

flavors
are
good
could
very
well
go

with

quickly
large

leaves

but
not
much
as
it
settles
itself
out
aroma
is
light
grains

grasses
a
touch
of
bready
malts
and
a
bit
of
a
lingering
hop
note
that
is
soo
faint
i
dont
know
how
i
picked
it
up
clean
crisp
and
light
feel
and
flavor
there
is
really
not
much
to
it
a
touch
of
peach
perhaps
on
the
tongue
but
that
was
all
nothing
to
write
home
about
medium
bodied
but
on
the
lighter
end
with
some
tight
carbonation
and
zesty
spice
dry
and
earthy
with
hints
of
grass
straw
and
pepper
bready
yeast
is
the
most
prominent
flavor
but
it
doesnt
add
much
to
the
palate
sweetness
toward
the
finish
with
hints
of
apple
and
lemon
peel
kind
of
bland
but
somewhat
easy
to
drink
o
i
like
this
beer
for
hot
summer
days
and
nights
it
has
just
the
right
amount
of
flavor
without
beeing
too
overpowering
well
this
is
a
watery
beer
but
representing
this
benighted
style
its
not
bad
an
enjoyable
quaff
i
have
to
admit
this
is
definitely
a
warm
weather
beer
it
is
light
in
taste
texture
color
and
alcohol
content
this
is
what
i
look
for
in
a
warm
weather
beer
it
is
straight
forward
without
any
need
for
lemon
or
lime
flavoring
however
the
lack
of
flavoring
also
leaves
you
wanting
a
little
more
taste
in
the
beer
especially
if
you
like
darker
beers
like
i
do
this
beer
pours
out
like
a
traditional
blonde
ale
the
coloe
is
yellow
with
a
minimal
haze
to
it
the
small
has
some
grains
and
citrus
in
it
the
taste
follows
through
with
a
lot
of
citrus
almost
like
grapefruit
the
mouthfeel
is
light
and
smooth
overall
this
brew
is
a
decent
summer
beer
worth
a
try
md
body
is
thin
but
compliments
the
delicate
flavor
very
easy
drinker
despite
low
alcohol
there
is
plenty
of
flavor
and
it
was
priced
well
this
was
strange
to
say
the
least
the
expierience
i
mean
got
this
on
tap
at
a
local
inn
first
off
and
friend
and
i
struggled
to
pick
up
on
any
scent
particullarly
with
this
beer
secondly
this
beer
hit
my
pallet
and
felt
and
tasted
like
water
in
all
honestly
my
best
describtion
would
be
coors
only
more
water
im
going
to
have
to
try
this
beer
in
a
different
format
this
is
to
surprising
perhaps
something
was
wrong
with
the
keg
regardless
be
forwardned
first
impression
is
a
wave
of
corn
graininess
not
good
kind
of
musty
tasting
there
is
a
kiss
of
bitterness
on
the
end
followed
by
a
lingering
cooked
corn
flavor
disappointing
this
beer
is
a
very
refreshing
very
drinkable
beer
and
once
i
tried
it
i
bought
a
case
a
very
nice
summer
blond
beer
give
it
a
try
let
me
first
say
that
i
have
not
been
a
fan
of
river
horse
beers
in
the
past
that
said
i
actually
dont
think
this
is
that
bad
of
a
brew
is
it
great
absolutly
not
but
it
has
a
very
laid
back
texture
and
understated
drinkability
which
results
in
an
average
beer
that
can
be
quite
tremendous
when
enjoyed
in
the
proper
setting
ie
hot
summer
day
its
strength
lies
in
its
ability
to
avoid
the
pitfalls
that
too
many
summer
brews
fall
victim
too
ie
excessive
citrus
overstated
flavors
etc
river
horse
tones
it
down
nicely
unlike
their
liquid
cement
monstrosity
hopalotamus
and
make
a
very
solid
albeit
not
great
summer
beer
that
i
might
not
go
out
of
my
way
to
purchase
but
will
enjoy
if
i
come
across
it
overall
a
great
summmertime
brew
d
not
something
i
will
drink
again
in
succession
i
could
barely
finish
two
maybe
one
of
these
if
its
all
i
have
but
i
doubt
id
purchase
this
again
flavors
are
all
over
the
place
sweet
artificial
honey
flavor
is
over
the
top
which
cripples
drinkability
really
off
balanced
bottle
a
nice
golden
color
a
fairly
light
aroma
of
faint
malt
and
hops
the
taste
is
more
faint
hops
than
malt
this
is
a
lightweight
fairly
charcterless
brew
fine
to
drink
after
a
lawnmowing
excursion
or
to
quench
a
summer
thirst
but
overall
not
a
very
interesting
beer
poured
from
a
brown
12
oz
bottle
has
a
cloudy
yellow
color
with
a
12
inch
head
smell
is
mild
some
malts
taste
is
crisp
light
some
malts
and
slightly
sweet
feels
medium
bodied
in
the
mouth
and
is
highly
drinkable
overall
this
makes
for
a
good
quality
brew
oopewan
d
average
light
ale
drinkable
yes
flavorful
no
d
goes
down
nicely
once
you
get
rid
of
the
pea
flavor
tm
smooth
slightly
sweet
crisp
nice
tingle
from
the
carbonation
short
dry
finish
with
not
much
aftertaste
drinkability
besides
being
light
and
a
low
abv
i
really
couldnt
stomach
to
have
another
one
of
these
nothing
special
d
session
beer
i
like
power
hour
better
this
is
an
extremely
drinkable
summer
offering
from
river
horse
d
nice
drinkability
and
unique
flavor
makes
this
worthy
of
a
try
i
would
buy
a
sixer
of
this
i
really
hope
i
got
a
bad
batch
of
this
i
cant
imagine
the
carbonation
level
in
this
bottle
could
possibly
be
representative
of
the
beer
however
it
has
got
to
be
the
fizziest
darn
beer
ive
ever
set
my
lips
on
absolutely
undrinkable
carbonation
levels
i
tried
to
pour
it
into
a
glass
but
it
immediately
fizzed
to
the
rim
burp
wasnt
impressed
with
it
otherwise
with
the
pungent
citris
flavor
making
it
taste
more
like
a
7up
than
a
beer
i
would
recommend
for
a
hot
summer
day
not
a
year
round
champ
but
a
good
drinkable
summer
beer
drinkability
yknow
its
not
so
terrible
once
all
of
that
damnable
carbonation
settles
down
the
beer
pours
a
cloudy
gold
color
with
a
12
white
head
that
fades
to
lacing
the
aroma
is
decent
it
has
a
dry
yet
fruity
malt
scent
that
boasts
of
pale
and
wheat
malts
as
well
as
a
nice
lemony
zest
it
has
a
slight
bisquity
aroma
the
taste
is
pretty
good
it
has
a
light
pale
and
wheat
malt
flavor
that
goes
down
smooth
and
finishes
earthy
and
dry
with
a
slight
lemon
zest
the
mouthfeel
is
fine
it
is
a
low
bodied
beer
with
adequate
carbonation
this
is
an
easy
drinking
summer
ale
but
not
a
beer
you
will
go
to
lengths
to
obtain
its
perfect
for
those
hot
afternoons
average
drinkability
easy
to
drink
non
filling
but
there
are
so
many
more
that
are
so
much
better
i
wouldnt
go
out
of
my
way
to
get
it
but
i
would
pick
it
up
again
bottom
line
it
doesnt
taste
bad
because
for
the
most
part
it
doesnt
taste
strange
brew
it
might
almost
quench
a
thist
in
the
heat
because
of
its
inoffensiveness
but
not
much
of
a
beer
a
pleasant
summer
beer
but
nothing
outstanding
pours
a
deeper
shade
of
straw
in
my
glass
with
very
little
head
despite
what
i
thought
was
a
good
pour
smells
of
some
slight
fruit
bready
yeast
and
citrus
drinking
the
beer
i
found
it
to
be
very
bland
yet
smooth
and
satisfying
yet
at
the
same
time
you
can
def
chug
this
beer
but
that
is
about
its
best
quality
there
is
a
noticable
lack
of
carbonation
which
i
found
strange
too
all
in
all
a
great
beer
for
the
warmer
weather
but
thats
about
it
the
beer
pours
a
cloudy
gold
color
with
a
12
white
head
that
fades
to
lacing
the
aroma
is
decent
it
has
a
dry
yet
fruity
malt
scent
that
boasts
of
pale
and
wheat
malts
as
well
as
a
nice

it

that
goes

with
a
slight

the
mouthfeel
is
fine
it
is
a
low
bodied
beer
with
adequate
carbonation
this
is
an
easy
drinking
summer
ale
but
nothing
to
write
home
about
its
perfect
for
those
hot
afternoons
another
fun
but
uninspiring
beer
from
river
horse
drinkablity
would
be
average
as
mentioned
before
there
was
a
slight
sour
and
a
slight
cardboard
taste
that
means
i
caught
this
beer
at
the
end
of
its
life
still
fresh
this
would
be
an
average
beer
with
low
abv
to
drink
in
the
summer
while
doing
stuff
in
the
yard
thought
i
would
try
this
beer
as
summers
end
is
knocking
on
my
door
unfortunately
not
a
whole
lot
to
this
beer
pours
incredibly
pale
yellow
in
color
also
appears
slightly
tinged
green
slightly
hazy
only
a
thin
and
filmy
head
on
top
nose
is
amlts
but
they
come
across
as
corn
in
terms
of
flavor
tis
beer
reminds
me
of
long
nights
working
my
way
through
too
many
macros
adjuncts
lots
of
light
malts
plus
corn
and
other
adjunct
flavors
plus
the
hops
are
essentially
nonexistent
perhaps
could
make
a
suitable
picnic
beer
thin
crisp
mouthfeel
and
an
overall
pleasant
enough
character
makes
this
one
an
easy
drinker
on
a
hot
day
but
its
not
my
favorite
this
summer
ale
pours
a
bit
cloudy
with
a
thin
white
head
an
evident
nose
of
sweet
malt
was
appealing
but
the
brew
itself
was
somewhat
thin
and
mostly
sweet
ie
it
lacked
balance
the
body
was
there
due
to
the
sweetness
i
presume
but
overall
would
not
have
me
coming
back
for
more
overall
a
fair
summer
ale
which
might
fit
the
taste
of
your
average
lite
drinker
but
ill
stay
away
not
a
very
good
beer
this
was
my
first
river
horse
beer
and
if
all
the
other
beers
in
this
sampler
are
like
this
they
wont
be
in
business
too
much
longer
at
least
date
the
fucking
things
overall
a
very
bland
uninspiring
beer
with
a
taste
not
much
different
from
macro
crap
not
recommended
this
is
pretty
good
beer
its
one
of
the
first
blonde
ales
that
ive
had
that
actually
tastes
blonde
river
horse
may
not
have
a
derby
winner
here
but
summer
blonde
is
definitely
no
nag
i
think
id
rather
drink
a
coke
than
this
beer
overall
a
decentmediorce
summer
blondewont
offend
mostly
clear
gold
blond
color
just
a
thin
white
rim
of

is
the
only
interesting
part
of
this
otherwise
boring
brew
sweet
creamy
wheat
mixed
in
with
some

is
very
sweet
some
light

nothing

mineral
aftertaste

a
very
slightly
hazy
pale
straw
with
a
medium
sized
white
head
that
quickly

and
barely

the
glass
aroma
is
very
light
mostly
just
a
faint
graininess
flavor
is
somewhat
sweet
lightly
breadygrainy
with
a
hint

thinmedium
in

fairly
bland
and
boring
this
beer
was
not
really
to
my
liking
though
i
have
no
problem
finishing
the
six
pack
i
have
already
purchased
i
would
suggest
it
to
someone
who
likes
flavorful
smooth
lightbodied
beers
but
i
found
it
too
thin
to
be
enjoyable
i
could
sit
back
and
drink
some
of
these
on
a
summer
afternoonevening
it
sort
of
sparkles
nothing
spectacular
about
this
beer
and
certainly
nothing
offensive
the
beer
poured
a
hazy
yellow
color
with
a
small
head
that
quickly
disappated
the
aroma
was
of
slight
citrus
the
malt
come
through
on
the
tongue
with
slight
bitterness
the
bitterness
lasted
a
bit
after
swallowing
very
dry
and
light
carbonation
definitely
drinkable
since
it
has
a
lighter
body
but
not
overly
exciting
pours
a
slightly
hazey
light
golden
color
with
a
light
head
that
leaves
some
light
lacingaroma
is
definently
malty
and
grainy
with
some
light
sweetness
the
taste
has
a
nice
malty
backbone
but
nothing
really
gives
it
some
umph
this
a
solid
brew
easy
to
drink
quite
a
few
of
these
not
very
complex
the
flavor
is
smooth
and
malty
with
a
spicy
carbonated
mouthfeel
hops
take
up
the
rear
providing
a
mildly
bitter
herbal
finish
a
little
muddy
tasting
but
still
finish
the
beer
nicely
no
dryness
yet
crisp
malts
are
fairly
clean
with
a
slight
pear
esteriness
some
nuttiness
towards
the
end
just
before
the
hops
slide
in
very
slight
soapy
aftertaste
but
all
told
this
is
surprisingly
tasty
not
terribly
complex
but
flavorful
and
quenching
very
true
to
the
blonde
ale
style
summer
beers
seem
to
be
getting
better
and
better
a
hazy
golden
body
is
capped
by
a
creamy
head
of
brightwhite
foam
that
holds
fairly
well
before
dropping
to
a
creamy
collar
and
some
whispy
surface
foam
lacing
however
is
limited
the
nose
is
intriguing
with
a
soft
wheattinged
grainy
malt
thats
smoothed
by
a
light
touch
of
buttery
diacetyl
and
backed
by
a
subtle
fruitiness
the
body
is
medium
and
it
appears
creamy
and
smooth
in
the
mouth
due
to
a
fine
moderate
carbonation
the
buttery
diacetyl
found
in
the
nose
is
a
bit
stronger
in
the
flavor
yet
it
actually
seems
to
work
for
the
beer
by
combining
with
a
grainy
maltiness
thats
gently
balanced
by
mildly
spicy
hops
theres
a
malty
sweet
flavor
to
it
that
i
associate
with
the
dextrins
delivered
by
carapils
malt
but
its
not
overdone
and
it
retains
a
refreshing
quality
it
finishes
with
a
lingering
note
of
sweet
malt
that
slowly
receeds
to
reveal
some
gentle
background
hop
flavor
and
delicate
bitterness
overall
a
very
decent
summer
beer
that
might
not
be
really
refreshing
right
after
mowing
the
lawn
but
has
a
little
bit
more
malt
flavor
to
it
for
when
youre
relaxing

a
late

it
is
truly
an
exact
science
to
get
rid
of
or
at

hide
all
of
the
off

the
only
way
to
make
this
beer
better
would
be
to
hop
andor
lager
the
hell
out

it
o
not

overall
3

a
good
average
beer
but
with
no
qualities
that
really
stand
out
i
am
a
very
big
fan
of
all
of
heavy
seas
brews
that
i
have
had
so
this
was
actually
somewhat
of
a
disappointment
of
their
line
to
me
i
got
as
part
of
a
botmc
pours
a
fizzy
yellow
with
a
moderate
white
head
the
aroma
is
bready
musty
the
hops
are
bready
grassy
it
has
a
lingering
finish
the
body
is
medium
light
very
quaffable
not
a
whole
lot
going
on
would
be
good
on
a
hot
day
or
maybe
as
a
transition
beer
i
poured
this
very
average
beer
into
my
tumbler
at
45
degrees
the
beer
was
a
nice
golden
color
but
poured
a
weak
head
that
was
gone
very
fast
the
beer
has
a
yeasty
bready
smell
and
the
taste
was
just
plain
beer
not
good
enough
for
another
try
i
will
not
buy
again
o
nothing
fancy
here
at
all
just
an
easy
drinking
sessioner
goes
down
without
any
problems
might
purchase
again
if
i
need
a
no
frillspoolshoot
the
shit
kind
of
brew
would
go
good
with
a
pizza
or
some
ball
park
dogs
definitely
a
good
intro
for
bmc
drinkers
cheers
this
beer
doesnt
necessarily
have
the
best
flavor
nor
does
it
have
depth
but
it
is
light
and
sessionable
theres
nothing
bad
about
this
beer
but
there
isnt
anything
that
stands
out
either
i
wont
buy
it
again
but
i
wouldnt
turn
it
down
if
it
was
offered
to
me
overall
ok
but
nothing
special
here
this
is
a
medium
bodied
brew
with
a
modest
level
of
carbonation
it
is
crisp
and
easy
drinking
but
really
a
mild
brew
even
for
the
style
i
would
be
hard
pressed
to
find
any
real
reason
to
return
to
this
brew
overall
drinkable
like
so
many
beers
from
this
brewery
however
just
not
that
imaginative
and
obviously
made
for
the
masses
o
decent
golden
ale
not
my
favorite
beer
from
clipper
city
but
it
went
down
smooth
and
was
easily
drinkable
decent
a
nice
little
session
that
would
taste
good
on
a
95
degree
day
o
overall
i
consider
it
a
soso
beer
the
flavor
is
pretty
good
but
the
smell
and
appearance
leave
much
to
be
desired
theres
nothing
that
makes
me
want
to
buy
another
one
of
these
oits
drinkable
but
id
like
a
little
more
flavor
from
an
american
ale
i
have
mixed
feelings
about
the
beer
boring
flavors
but
well
executed
with
a
spectacular
boosted
body
for
such
a
crisp
light
beer
there
we
go
super
fresh
sampler
pack
these
babies
are
best
by
32012
this
one
pours
a
brilliant
bright
clear
golden
hue
with
a
full
thicket
of
egg
shell
white
head
frothing
head
dwindles
down
leaving
layers
of
intricate
lacing
layers
of
cereal
grains
light
fruit
notes
and
floral
hops
come
across
my
nares
a
very
pleasant
herbal
grassiness
as
well
a
perfect
clean
drinking
gold
ale
really
nothing
else
to
add
other
than
damn
its
refreshing
and
its
good
cold
and
doesnt
hurt
to
let
it
warm
up
this
is
like
the
most
solid
homebrew
gone
pro
brewer
beer
ever
simple
flavorful
and
nails
the
style
guidelines
a
true
session
ale
at
4
5
abv
packs
a
nice
amount
of
flavor
into
a
poundable
format
ive
never
seen
this
stuff
outside
of
the
sampler
packs
lighter
bodied
ale
with
ample
sturdy
carbonation
really
packs
in
the
flavor
and
definitely
pulls
off
an
enjoyable
beer
in
a
style
that
most
beer
geeks
dont
give
much
attention
to
out
of
a
bottle
this
beer
was
a
golden
color
surprise
with
one
finger
of
head
the
retention
was
not
very
good
and
the
lacing
sparse
subsequently
the
aroma
was
of
light
citrus
sweet
breads
dry
grains
and
a
hint
of
green
apples
the
flavors
were
similar
being
mostly
a
compilation
of
citrus
zest
dry
grains
and
some
sweetness
similar
to
both
caramelized
sugars
and
sweet
breads
sort
of
like
an
amber
ale
yet
it
claimed
to
be
an
american
blonde
the
mouthfeel
was
a
little
thin
the
body
mediumlight
and
the
carbonation
fine
an
ok
beer
but
it
seemed
unsure
of
what
it
was
trying
to
be
i
drink
as
much
heavy
seas
on
my
weekends
as
i
can
muster
my
buddy
fassio
left
me
a
gold
ale
in
exchange
for
one
of
my
guinness
black
lagers
and
i
have
to
say
i
really
enjoy
this
brew
it
looks
great
in
a
glass
and
has
a
nice
mouth
feel
excellent
drinkability
but
a
little
heavy
on
the
corn
aftertaste
overall
a
solid
and
refreshing
drink
notes
a
decent
blonde
ale
one
of
the
better
ones
that
i
have
had
cheers
mo
the
beer
is
very
crisp
and
drinkable
overall
it
fits
the
style
very
well
but
does
not
exceed
expectations
ontap
at
alewitch
the
brew
pours
a
translucent
gold
capped
with
a
thin
wispy
white
head
and
deposits
a
surprising
amount
of
lace
the
nose
has
very
little
presence
offering
only
something
faintly
metallic
the
flavor
seems
better
initially
as
it
has
a
slightly
fruity
character
atop
a
very
basic
beery
profile
succeeding
quaffs
get
progressively
more
unpleasant
as
the
faint
tropical
fruity
notes
start
to
linger
like
a
cheap
daquiri
i
would
not
have
another
one
of
these
this
was
a
very
easy
to
drink
beer
the
flavor
was
good
probably
average
among
the
style
i
dont
know
if
i
would
seek
this
out
but
i
wouldnt
mind
having
it
again
not
my
favorite
style
but
not
a
bad
beer
average
for
the
style
could
be
i
drank
this
one
too
late
easy
drinking
yes
malt
oriented
i
dont
think
so
but
the
extremely
high
quality
crafting
tha
twent
into
making
this
is
worth
something
this
is
a
high
quality
beer
hv
o
usually
i
like
to
sit
and
analyze
my
beers
a
bit
but
this
tasted
so
good
i
was
surprised
how
quickly
it
disappeared
from
my
glass
nothing
too
complex
just
well
made
and
one
of
the
best
mouthfeels
in
recent
memory
o
a
nice
easy
to
drink
blonde
ale
not
complex
but
a
nice
treat
for
a
hot
sunny
day
the
mouthfeel
is
medium
bodied
with
carbonation
being
moderate
overall
it
was
a
decent
beer
but
nothing
special
it
was
clean
and
crisp
and
showed
a
lot
of
pale
grainy
malts
to
it
easy
drinking
and
moderately
flavorful
not
a
bad
beer
for
the
style
but
not
an
outstanding
beer
overall
either
doverall
i
was
more
impressed
with
this
beer
then
i
thought
would
drink
this
again
very
nice
drinkability
basic
blond
ale
dynamic
taste
bold
and
drinkable
more
bitter
than
the
smell
might
indicate
not
as
delicate
as
some
blondestheres
a
definite
black
pepper
aspect
to
the
swallow
the
grain
kinda
gets
lost
in
this
one
even
on
the
initial
sip
i
like
the
bodyits
more
full
than
most
from
this
style
high
carbonation
as
well
overall
a
very
weak
offering
from
a
pretty
good
brewery
glad
i
only
bought
a
single
not
the
beer
of
the
year
but
still
a
pretty
nice
example
of
what
the
style
is
like
drinks
easily
and
refreshes
on
a
pretty
hot
day
o
a
mild
and
drinkable
session
ale
4
overall
a
light
flavored
easy
drinker
with
crisp
finish
nothing
spectacular
but
a
well
made
local
beer
that
is
easy
to
drink
and
i
would
definitely
try
again
anytime
pours
a
nice
gold
color
a
white
ring
washes
around
the
glass
smell
is
tight
and
potpourrilike
fresh
grass
and
orange
taste
starts
off
juicy
and
slightly
hoppy
overall
a
tart
roastycitrusy
combo
that
im
not
entirely
wary
of
finishes
a
bit
sour
and
a
little
sweet
these
blonde
ales
are
odd
to
my
palette
but
thats
alright
o
overall
a
pretty
average
blonde
ale
some
nice
citrus
and
fruit
in
the
taste
very
easy
to
drink
wouldnt
seek
it
out
again
but
worth
trying
once
o
solid
beer
affordable
and
local
overall
is
a
a
good
blonde
summer
beer
easy
to
drink
while
at
a
bbq
or
watching
a
game
overall
this
is
a
pretty
good
blonde
ale
nothing
too
special
or
noteworthy
good
drinkability
overall
it
is
a
very
light
crisp
beer
more
or
less
what
you
would
expect
for
a
golden
ale
d
tastes
good
not
too
strong
and
i
could
have
a
bunch
more
but
there
isnt
too
much
excitement
easily
a
sessionable
beer
if
not
bold
enough
to
be
an
every
day

example

d
a
nice
beer
to
relax
to
definitely
high
on
the
drinkability
scale

this
one
surprised
me
given
the
prior
ratings
bottle
serving
totally
average
in
every
way
nothing
special
a
bit

my
taste

barely
produce

12
head
with
an
aggressive
pour
hardly
any

watered

taste
nothing
special
about
this
ale
i
cannot
find
any
redeeming
qualities
to
highlight
nothing
spectacular
there
are
other
options
out
for
this
category
but
it
was
ok
d
tasty
goes
down
easily
not
too
filling
mild
kick
good
representation
of
style
its
nothing
extraordinary
but
this
is
a
solid
beer
that
is
worth
drinking
for
a
long
time
pours
a
bright
golden
straw
and
produces
little
foam
and
lazy
bubbles
the
smell
isnt
particularly
inviting
and
the
taste
is
somewhat
bland
it
does
have
a
slight
hint
of
grassyness
but
nothing
too
discernible
from
something
that
is
mass
produced
drinkability
is
high
considering
the
abv
and
the
mild
flavor
you
could
go
all
night
with
these
but
you
could
save
a
little
dough
and
opt
for
bmc
if
youre
sessioning
drinkability
is
pretty
good
this
is
a
light
abv
beer
and
would
be
fine
as
a
session
beer
an
ok
summer
beer
that
i
probably
wont
drink
again
poured

is

more
hops
than
i
expected
from
this

well
balanced
feels
medium
bodied
in
the
mouth
and
has
good
drinkability
overall
a
good
quality
brew
d
not
a
bad
beer
but
pretty
forgettable
less
interesting
and
unique
but
more
sturdy
than
their
summer
ale
and
while
i
rate
them
both
the
same
i
liked
this
one
slightly
more
for
the
bigger
malt
backbone
and
more
varied
hops
pours
clear
golden
with
a
lively
head
that
is
dismayingly
short
lived
the
aroma
is
weak
but
with
a
slight
toastiness
to
it
the
flavor
is
decently
light
malty
with
a
little
shiver
of
hops
the
finish
is
a
little
flat
and
sour
which
isnt
such
a
happy
thing
the
mouthfeel
is
quite
thin
drinkability
definite
sessionable
beer
beer
went
down
quickly
on
a
hot
day
cheers
overall
this
is
probably
the
best
blonde
ale
ive
had
i
really
enjoyed
this
for
the
style
its
nothing
overly
complex
or
impressive
but
its
quite
nice
on
a
hot
day
not
very
good
honestly
i
think
i
would
prefer
a
coors
light
still
like
ska
though
decent
brew
cant
really
review
it
bcuz
i
didnt
dribknit
super
fresh
but
again
another
one
worth
trying
not
bad
in
any
way
but
also
doesnt
do
much
for
me
i
appreciate
that
it
is
mostly
clean
but
it
just
lacks
any
compelling
flavors
or
use
of
them
this
beer
might
be
light
on
color
but
not
in
taste
i
just
had
this
beer
about
a
week
ago
and
it
quickly
has
become
one
of
my
favorites
overall
not
my
preference
but
in
a
pinch
id
take
a
can
or
two
to
the
pool
soso
not
unpleasant
but
not
terribly
impressive
either
looks
quite
nice
but
the
aroma
and
flavour
are
bland
and
understated
a
decent
body
cant
rescue
it
the
honey
might
be
there
an
evanescent
floweriness
lurks
in
the
background
however
its
hard
to
be
sure
drinkable
but
forgettable
no
need
to
seek
it
out
this
beer
goes
down
quite
well
could
use
a
bit
more
spice
just
a
bit
body
was
light
and
carbonation
seemed
a
bit
down
still
good
summer
beer
pours
out
to
a
rocky
frothy
white
head
that
falls
very
little
lacing
is
moderate
pale
strawgold
color
aroma
is
sweet
grains
floral
hops
and
a
slight
buttercreme
note
flavor
is
mostly
pale
lager
malt
and
noble
hops
to
balance
with
a
dry
crisp
finish
mouthfeel
is
light
and
co2
is
appropriate
this
is
a
very
good
blonde
ale
rjt
i
didnt
think
this
was
so
damn
bad
its
just
another
very
light
beer
but
it
has
a
little
more
style
and
substance
than
the
average
for
this
category
an
enjoyable
brewski
for
the
twilight
on
the
patio
from
the
12
oz
can
at
the
radisson
on
the
yavapai
reservation
o
this
is
a
great
blonde
not
sure
why
it
is
getting
reviewed
poorly
i
actually
like
the
beer
but
its
not
exceptional
its
really
balanced
and
really
light
and
highly
drinkable
c
o
decent
blonde
ale
but
subpar
very
sessionable
with
high
abv
but
not
my
personal
choice
for
a
blonde
ale
drinks
more
like
an
american
light
lager
o
good
but
not
too
impressive
atmosphere
is
good
enough
fair
body
and
nondescript
nose
flavor
is
a
light
and
crisp
doughy
thing
overall
this
is
a
pretty
good
quaff
reminds
me
of
a
kolsch
which
is
a
distinct
improvement
from
the
smell
lots
of
pale
malt
up
front
with
just
enough
hop
to
provide
balance
the
body
of
this
beer
seems
off
to
me
its
way
too
thin
and
the
carbonation
is
way
to
high
this
is
distracting
otherwise
i
find
this
to
be
a
flavorful
blonde
mouthfeel
is
light
crisp
and
refreshing
with
very
mild
carbonation
a
very
light
and
almost
watery
body
and
a
sessionable
ease
that
lets
it
flow
down
like
water
micro
impersonating
macro
this
was
ok
a
great
lawn
mowing
beer
this
is
a
rather
malty
brew
the
bready
flavors
are
intense
there
are
some
fruity
notes
that
come
trhough
as
well
the
lemon
is
most
evident
there
are
some
subtle
grassy
hops
but
overall
this
is
a
bit
unbalanced
and
ultimately
a
bit
forgettable
part
of
the
ska
brewing
mixed
12
pack
of
cans
enjoyed
on
a
nice
hot
week
at
the
beach
blonde
ales
are
typically
boring
styles
but
this
one
does
seem
to
have
a
bit
more
body
and
taste
than
the
usual
one
nice
lemony
touch
crisp
hops
and
clean
finish
an
above
average
blonde
ale
but
probably
wouldnt
seek
it
out
again
this
beer
has
a
nice
peachy
smell
and
a
fairly
decent
clean
citrusy
bright
taste
i
am
drinking
it
out
of
a
regular
pint
glass
it
is
not
the
best
beer
i
have
ever
had
but
it
is
a
fairly
decent
session
beer
with
a
nice
clean
taste
for
a
hot
day
it
is
fairly
drinkable
but
i
wish
it
wasnt
in
a
can
overall
standard
fare
from
ska
not
great
not
awful
pretty
enjoyable
when
the
temp
is
103
and
youre
sitting
on
the
deck
but
ive
had
better
not
regrettable
its
a
refreshing
blonde
sure
beats
bmc
for
tailgating
parties
ect
very
sessionable
highly
recommended
on
hot
days
or
for
drinking
outdoors
the
taste
however
is
not
as
impressive
there
is
no
hop
flavor
and
it
is
best
compared
to
an
adjunt
lager
with
wheat
the
beer
is
drinkable
but
the
flavor
wont
keep
you
interested
the
feel
is
light
which
isnt
bad
but
the
aftertaste
is
poor
and
rather
bland
this
is
a
step
up
from
the
big
name
beers
but
a
small
step
indeed
from
a
can
to
a
duvel
tulip
beer
pours
a
clear
golden
yellow
with
a
finger
length
white
head
aroma
is
light
bread
corn
very
faint
floral
not
much
here
taste
is
bready
malt
more
corn
and
lower
quality
grains
mouthfeel
is
thin
and
forgettable
not
my
favorite
beer
overall
its
a
fairly
good
beer
very
sessionable
at
5
3
but
not
quite
substantial
enough
for
my
personal
tastes
looks
drinks
and
nearly
tastes
like
a
lite
beer
but
with
some
nice
flavoe
complexity
and
balance
a
straw
yellow
clear
pour
into
a
pint
glass
with
nice
amounts
of
head
and
lacing
throughout
the
glass
smells
of
pils
and
grassy
hops
a
hint
of
citrus
tastes
a
bit
bitter
and
wheaty
not
much
else
there
tastewise
a
nice
refreshing
mouthfeel
though
light
bodied
and
makes
your
cheeks
cringe
a
tiny
bit
with
the
bitterness
but
is
overall
a
crisp
and
refreshing
summer
blonde
ale
pours
a
nearly
clear
yellow
with
a
fading
1
5
inch
white
head
but
i
prefer
this
one
ice
cold
right
from
the
can
smells
like
a
medium
bodied
wheat
beer
some
malty
textures
but
nothing
overbearing
hops
here
serve
merely
to
make
it
crisp
nothing
ornamental
with
the
hops
flavor
wise
feel
is
pretty
good
bubbly
and
foamy
and
drinkable
this
is
a
very
light
beer
in
terms
of
it
filling
you
up
very
sessionable
on
a
summery
afternoon
definitely
nothing
special
by
skas
standards
but
it
serves
it
purpose
rather
effectively
o
decent
blonde
ale
with
some
nice
creamy
textures
and
a
solid
group
of
flavours
unlike
a
lot
of
american
beers
there
doesnt
seem
to
be
the
usual
identity
crisis
here
its
just
a
straight
homage
or
ripoff
of
a
classic
belgian
pale
ale
not
sure
how
this
was
classified
as
an
american
blonde
im
sure
thats
not
a
real
category
but
its
an
enjoyable
beer
with
modest
aspirations
thanks
to
beermasons
for
this
and
pours
a
see
through
golden
blonde
hue
which
leaves
a
frothy
three
finger
head
and
clingy
lacingthe
smell
is
quite
average
and
has
aromas
of
honeyed
maltsherbal
hops
and
some
grassinessthe
mouthfeel
is
lightbodied
too
light
for
me
and
the
tastes
arnt
much
better
very
similar
to
smell
with
hints
of
honeyed
maltsgrassy
herbal
hopscereal
and
bread
and
overall
love
the
label
but
thats
it
for
me
and
wouldnt
buy
or
drink
again
cheers
pours
a
golden
yellow
with
a
slight
white
head
that
quickly
drops
down
some
honey
some
lemon
zest
some
malt
in
both
flavor
and
aroma
very
simple
a
nice
medium
body
to
it
overall
this
is
a
very
easy
drinking
beer
not
the
most
memorable
but
every
once
in
a
while
it
can
hit
the
spot
nothing
wrong
with
this
decent
simple
enough
to
be
sessionable
body
is
big
enough
to
be
content
with
just
one
have
bought
plenty
worse
overall
drinkability
a
bit
disappointing
but
still
worth
the
try
merry
christmasthe
first
beer
on
this
blessed
holiday
is
a
true
blonde
from
ska
the
beer
pours
a
golden
clear
with
thin
white
head
that
is
not
lacing
due
to
the
fruitiness
the
smell
has
subtle
lemon
flare
with
delicate
malt
balance
the
taste
is
a
great
balanced
beer
with
good
lemon
zeal
the
mouthfeel
is
a
medium
to
light
body
with
good
carbonation
overall
the
beer
is
quite
tasty
and
highly
recommended

o
overall
its
pretty
average
but
is
quite
pleasant
to
drink
and
would
make
a
good
session
beer
overall
not
a
bad
brew
but
not
very
interesting
either
overall
impression
refreshing
but
wouldnt
go
out
of
my
way
to
have
again
the
main
reason
i
went
for
this
was
it
was
in
a
can
and
the
other
8
cans
i
grabbed
were
all
to
match
up
craft
beers
with
other
friends
a
b
cans
and
see
what
they
thought
so
far
the
ofallon
wheach
is
winning
w
skas
modus
hoperandi
in
a
close
2nd
overall
at
5
3
this
is
easily
sessionable
if
the
sweetness
doesnt
build
too
much
i
think
i
could
handle
two
or
three
before
the
sugar
got
to
be
too
much
that
said
i
think
ska
created
a
very
accessible
beer
in
the
blonde
that
is
palatable
for
the
uninitiated
to
good
beer
and
the
seasoned
vets
who
can
still
enjoy
it
even
if
it
is
toned
down
a
bit
overall
this
is
just
simply
boring
but
dont
rule
this
out
being
a
light
beer
to
be
enjoyed
and
paired
with
food
sampled
one
while
eating
pizza
and
one
before
bed
it
definitely
made
my
pizza
into
a
pretty
damn
good
meal
however
look
to
something
else
if
youre
just
looking
to
drink
a
beer
one
and
done
overalljust
another
blonde
ale
nothing
to
brad
about
but
would
drink
more
pours
a
crystal
clear
light
yellow
color
with
a
1
inch
white
head
that
fades
to
a
film
on
the
top
of
the
beer
nice
rings
of
lace
form
around
the
glass
on
the
drink
down
smell
is
of
sweet
malt
and
slight
honey
aromas
the
taste
is
mainly
sweet
malt
with
some
fruity
and
honey
notes
this
beer
has
good
carbonation
with
a
crisp
and
clean
mouthfeel
overall
this
is
a
good
easy
drinking
blond
ale
that
i
am
glad
i
got
to
try
light
golden
yellow
with
a
nice
white
frothy
head
that
faded
quickly
leaving
behind
a
decent
but
shortlived
lace
ring
smell
was
lively
lots
of
yeast
was
present
even
in
the
aroma
and
it
was
very
light
bread
and
earthy
grains
were
the
predominant
aromas
taste
was
crisp
light
and
refreshing
perfect
for
a
summer
day
very
smooth
and
full
of
bready
and
earthy
grain
tones
with
a
slight
hop
presence
as
it
warmed
overall
this
was
excellent
for
exactly
what
it
was
if
you
pour
it
out
into
a
glass
you
will
be
presented
with
a
hazy
golden
color
and
just
a
slight
head
the
aroma
of
yeast
lemons
and
grains
drift
from
the
glass
and
begin
to
brighten
up
your
day
the
full
essence
of
summer
fills
your
mouth
when
you
take
that
first
sip
flavors
of
sweet
malts
lemon
and
a
slight
hop
presence
brings
a
smile
to
the
face
drinking
this
beer
you
can
easily
knock
back
a
few
cans
and
just
enjoy
the
afternoon
better
than
the
typical
can
of
beer
i
can
have
on
the
golf
course
will
keep
looking
for
a
beer
that
i
can
really
enjoy
out
on
the
course
without
violating
the
rules
average
blonde
ale
really
potent
honey
character
but
thats
all
that
was
really
memorable
about
this
beer
overall
a
middle
of
the
road
blonde
ale
that
i
wont
remember
15
mins
from
now
not
that
its
bad
but
just
not
much
there
to
get
excited
about
avail
here
in
tx
rotation
i
like
the
other
ska
offerings
much
better
so
ill
stick
to
those
nn
needs
more
spice
possibly
from
hops
all
other
flavors
in
accordance
with
the
style
not
a
bad
session
beer
might
be
better
fresher
nothing
aggressive
or
memorable
d
good
for
sessions
or
multiples
goes
down
easy
nothing
to
complain
about
d
one
is
enough
for
me
maybe
in
a
pinch
id
drink
another
one
drinkability
different
enough
to
keep
me
interested
but
not
too
weird
where
its
more
like
a
onetime
experiment
id
have
a
couple
of
these
in
a
night
and
might
pick
up
another
one
but
i
am
not
infatuated

a
slightly
hazy
straw
color
with
a
white
head
head
is
foamy
and
hangs
around
for
a
while
eventually
leaving
some
thick
lacing
not
much
going
on
in
the
nose
mostly
grains
and
a
hint
of
citrus
taste
is
again
very
grainy
but
with
more
lemon
than
was
present
in
the
nose
not
much
else
going
on
lighter
bodied
with
a
crisp
finish
not
the
best
beer
ive
ever
had
but
i
do
have
to
say
i
could
easily
throw
a
few
of
these
back
to
summarize
a
decent
beer
but
nothing
to
really
write
home
about
i
guess
if
you
like
grainy
brews
this
one
is
for
you
also
nice
art
on
the
can
very
cool
d
a
nice
beer
not
overly
sweet
like
some
beers
brewed
with
honey
flavors
but
it
is
still
on
the
sweet
side
so
not
too
sessionable
d
nice
beer
to
sit
down
and
drink
the
mouthfeel
really
makes
the
beer
one
that
i
would
drinkt
more
than
one
of
pours
a
golden
blond
color
with
a
small
fluffy
white
head
that
dissipates
quickly
smells
of
grains
bread
honey
and
grass
with
a
hint
of
herbal
hops
smells
sweet
and
grainy
for
the
most
part
taste
is
sweet
with
lots
of
honey
in
the
taste
mixed
with
a
bit
of
grainy
malt
and
almost
enough
hops
to
keep
this
from
being
a
bit
sweet
medium
body
crisp
carbonation
sweet
sticky
mouthfeel
not
a
bad
little
drinker
smooth
sweet
and
tasty
its
a
decent
brew
nothing
really
wrong
with
it
but
nothing
exceptional
either
average
in
drink
not
much
about
it
makes
me
want
to
go
rushing
out
for
a
sixer
its
ok
tho
ok

on
the
bottom
of
the
can
pours
out
a
bright
golden
color
with
a
frothy
head
wonder
if
there
are
some
wheat
malts
in
there
nice
frothiness
and
lacing
on
the
sides
of
the
glass
smell
is
very
clean
more
like
a
lager
than
an
ale
the
taste
is
quite
crisp
dry
and
bitter
with
a
clean
herbal
bitter
aftertaste
mouthfeel
is
light
and
refreshing
another
good
beer
from
ska
last
i
had
was
their
winter
euphoria
this
i
guess
is
their
summer
style
beer
for
all
year
round
it
appears
i
actually
really
like
the
can
format
it
goes
into
a
glass
anyway
and
it
takes
up
less
space
in
the
trashcan
anyway
i
found
this
to
be
a
tasty
highly
drinkable
ale
with
a
nice
clean
aftertaste
almost
like
a
lager
would
pair
well
with
a
lot
of
great
summer
food
on
a
hot
day
goddamn
dyejobs
huh
wha
oh
yeah
the
review
ahem
this
chick
pours
a
clear
sortapale
golden
straw
topped
by
about
a
finger
or
so
of
white
foam
the
nose
comprises
wheat
flowers
orange
rind
and
light
honey
the
taste
is
nearly
identical
though
the
orange
rind
and
flowers
dominate
the
proceedings
all
filibustery
and
whatnot
wouldnt
that
have
been
a
better
politicalcharged
thriller
winnie
the
pooh
and
the
filibustery
day
yeah
i
went
there
the
onesidedness
really
hurts
things
the
body
is
a
heavyfeeling
light
with
a
moderate
carbonation
and
a
kinda
dry
finish
overall
a
decent
brew
nothing
worth
raving
or
ranting
about
im
not
sure
id
aim
for
another
one
any
time
soon
d
decent
beer
nothing
flashy
or
bold
but
it
got
the
job
done
of
providing
something
to
wash
my
dinner
down
with
not
bad
but
there
is
a
reason
this
sat
in
my
fridge
for
a
while
ive
had
better
american
blonde
ales
for
sure
worth
a
shot
and
would
be
a
good
choice
while
consuming
lots
of
beer
drinkability
good
tailgatelawnmower
beer
drinks
easy
but
not
interesting
enough
for
me
to
want
to
session
on
poured
a
clear
pale
yellow
with
a
inch
and
a
half
white
head
with
minimal
lacing
aromas
of
biscuits
and
barley
malts
much
reminisant
of
a
budweiser
thou
lighter
in
carbonation
than
the
fore
mentioned
it
had
more
of
a
lager
taste
and
pretty
much
the
same
disappointment
save
your
money
and
have
a
bud
this
isnt
going
to
blow
anyone
away
but
its
probably
the
best
example
of
a
nonboring
american
blonde
i
can
think
of
definitely
on
par
with
the
examples
from
brick
and
montgomery
in
the
deep
south
overall
this
one
just
reminded
me
too
much
of
an
adjunct
lager
there
really
wasnt
a
lot
of
flavor
should
one
expect
a
lot
of
flavor
no
but
some
would
be
nice
its
good
thanks
to
woodychandler
for
the
trade
poured
from
a
12
oz
can
has
a
rich
golden
color
with
a
12
inch
head
smell
is
mainly
of
hops
taste
is
of
malts
and
hops
well
balanced
a
touch
of
citrus
feels
medium
bodied
in
the
mouth
and
is
very
drinkable
overall
this
is
a
good
quality
beer
this
is
a
light
bodied
brew
with
a
modest
amount
of
carbonation
fairly
drinkable
but
not
a
bold
amount
of
flavor
or
things
to
pick
out
in
the
nose
however
i
cant
fault
this
brew
considering
i
am
not
that
familiar
with
the
american
style
blonde
ale
my
impression
of
this
brew
is
that
with
its
easy
drinkability
and
lack
of
big
flavor
it
would
be
a
likely
substitute
for
a
lawnmower
beer
the
body
is
fairly
full
for
this
style
slightly
chewy
and
has
a
bit
of
depth
on
the
back
end
carbonation
level
is
lowtomoderate
nice
clean
flavors
make
this
up
the
honey
comes
through
a
bit
in
the
flavor
as
there
is
a
mild
sweetness
present
bitterness
is
low
on
this
but
that
is
expected
slight
grassy
notes
on
the
aftertaste
this
was
pretty
good
every
once
in
awhile
i
could
go
for
this
style
this
is
a
good
representation
check
it
out
d
a
pretty
good
beer
in
a
style
that
doesnt
all
too
often
interest
the
beer
geek
kind
of
kolsch
with
a
kiss
of
mead
definitely
worth
a
try
drinkability
is
good
even
with
the
so
so
mouthfeel
12
ounce
bottle
perhaps
not
surprisingly
pours
a
bright
blonde
color
with
minimal
head
aroma
is
all
cereal
malt
with
some
faint
grassy
hops
off
in
the
background
clear
light
malted
flavor
comes
through
with
some
light
hopping
adding
to
a
bittersweet
finish
light
mouthfeel
with
mild
carbonation
most
assuredly
a
beer
that
comes
in
on
the
light
end
of
the
spectrum
this
isnt
a
beer
that
will
come
out
and
wow
you
by
any
stretch
of
the
imagination
its
a
simple
straight
forward
beer
meant
to
be
enjoyed
on
hot
summer
days
pretty
not
bad
d
could
drink
this
all
night
low
abv
good
flavor
a
nice
little
ale
that
is
available
in
cans
a
winner
right
there
pours
a
bright
golden
color
with
one
inch
of
white
head
that
slowly
settled
to
a
halfinch
and
hung
in
there
to
the
bottom
of
the
glass
moderate
amount
of
lacing
is
left
on
the
glass
clean
aroma
of
bready
malt
and
cereal
grains
not
much
else
to
expand
on
in
the
aroma
pleasant
taste
of
light
malt
and
some
hops
giving
notes
of
melon
and
grass
just
slightly
sweet
finishes
clean
light
body
with
good
carbonation
that
keeps
things
lively
without
being
prickly
really
nice
for
a
lighter
tasting
beer
a
refreshing
beer
that
hit
the
spot
on
a
hot
evening
no
problem
finishing
off
several
of
these
in
a
sitting
drinkability
solid
enough
and
great
for
a
hot
summer
night
nothing
special
about
it
but
itd
definitely
sessionable
with
its
light
weight
and
low
abv
i
was
glad
to
find
this
beer
in
a
can
the
taste
is
really
smooth
and
tasty
golden
color
with
just
enough
of
a
hop
to
give
it
a
great
flavor
its
just
a
good
smooth
drinking
summer
time
beer
if
you
ate
looking
for
a
great
beer
for
a
night
bye
the
grill
with
friends
this
is
a
good
choice
d
interesting
to
try
and
decent
tasting
but
i
think
1
will
last
me
for
the
rest
of
my
life
kinda
of
an
odd
beer
but
not
awful
p
white
fish
toss
into
a
beer
batter
for
some
onion
rings
or
a
cheese
sauce
for
pretzels
sesame
or
leeks
seem
good
as
well
d
in
a
can
bonus
but
a
very
lighter
blonde
in
regards
to
taste
and
aroma
a
good
drinkable
and
light
bodied
beer
would
i
buy
more
of
it
i
hear
they
do
a
mixed
pack
of
ska
cans
and
that
would
definitely
be
a
worthy
investment
for
any
weekend
of
outdoor
activities
this
one
would
be
the
perfect
beer
to
start
with
before
going
on
to
the
others
m
d
nice
crisp
and
light
bodied
very
refreshing
and
a
good
summer
beer
d
decent
blonde
and
would
be
a
great
summer
brew
to
enjoy
in
the
hot
socal
heat
overall
i
enjoyed
this
beer
a
simple
beer
with
no
rice
or
corn
and
you
can
taste
the
difference
well
crafted
brew
with
good
malted
barley
touch
of
hops
and
a
nice
sweet
taste
d
a
little
tasty
goes
down
easily
not
too
filling
mild
kick
decent
representation
of
style
this
beer
seems
to
fit
the
lawnmower
beer
role
well
even
if
there
are
some
beers
out
there
that
fit
the
role
better
d
not
well
blended
not
a
very
good
representation
of
the
style
the
soapy
nature
is
overpowering
not
of
true
soap
but
of
the
overpowering
floral
nature
id
pass
on
this
one
in
the
future
i
look
foward
toi
try
the
true
blonde
dubbel
i
saw
on
the
shelf
taste
is
mildly
interesting
and
i
would
drink
one
if
offered
one
of
my
favorite
beers
has
a
very
good
taste
poors
nice
from
bottle
to
tall
glass
very
nice
taste
but
needs
to
be
your
style
of
beer
not
strong
but
flavorful
light
fruit
aroma
looses
bite
quick
so
drink
when
first
opened
i
can
easily
drink
a
6
pack
md
mouthfeel
is
thin
but
does
leave
a
pleasant
aftertaste
overall
this
is
a
very
drinkable
beer
which
could
easily
be
sessioned
light
yellow
golden
in
coloer
very
pretty
to
look
at
smells
a
little
of
faint
lemons
head
was
thin
gone
quickly
crisp
cool
refreshing
subtle
hints
of
citrus
slight
after
taste
though
this
would
be
good
on
a
summer
day
at
the
beach
not
really
my
style
pours
cloudy
yet
incredible
pale
golden
color
with
a
shallow
wispy
white
head
thats
gone
in
a
flash
leaving
spotty
patterns
of
lacing
the
smell
is
timid
yet
balanced
between
a
sweet
grainy
malt
and
bright
lemon
hop
adequately
carbonated
the
mouth
feel
is
bright
and
tangy
yet
finishes
smooth
as
the
sweet
flavor
takes
over
and
cleans
up
fairly
quickly
the
flavor
is
bright
sweet
refreshing
lemon
while
im
not
a
big
fan
of
this
style
i
found
that
this
one
was
easy
to
consider
d
drinkable
though
not
very
complex
hops
are
only
detected
with
a
subtle
hint
on
the
nose
and
a
sticky
film
on
the
lips
though
i
believe
that
is
to
style
its
a
cold
night
in
chicago
this
beer
is
more
suited
for
a
hot
summer
afternoon
when
you
want
something
refreshing
with
some
taste
but
not
too
heavy
initially
this
beer
came
off
sweet
and
light
then
dries
out
throughout
the
finish
with
citrusy
notes
nothing
offputting
just
sweet
and
dry
overall
this
is
a
very
drinkable
beer
but
nothing
stands
out
i
would
pick
some
up
and
dont
regret
bringing
this
home
in
my
suitcase
drinkability
this
is
a
chugger
very
drinkable
beer
this
is
an
easy
drinker
with
average
abv
that
is
barely
noticed
pours
a
clear
yellow
with
a
thin
white
head
nose
has
grassy
hops
and
some
pale
malts
taste
is
has
subtle
fruity
hops
and
grainy
malts
light
body
is
a
bit
thin
and
over
carbonated
could
use
a
bit
more
hops
but
a
decent
blonde
ale
from
ska
comes
in
cans
too
easy
to
drink
d
one
of
the
cleanest
ales
ive
had
to
date
overall
a
well
balenced
wheat
beer
clear
golden
yellow
with
a
short
but
dense
head
the
smell
is
quite
average
maybe
a
bit
of
wheat
or
is
it
malt
i
dont
know
because
the
beer
practically
has
no
aroma
other
than
a
beery
smell
the
taste
is
an
average
blonde
ale
nothing
hoppy
about
it
the
malts
are
unremarkable
boring
the
only
thing
this
beer
has
going
for
it
is
that
it
is
relatively
light
and
easy
to
drink
d
this
is
a
great
session
beer
that
i
could
have
a
few
of
d
this
is
a
pretty
nice
blonde
ale
its
great
to
find
a
sessionable
ale
in
a
can
two
fingers
of
bonewhite
head
with
good
retention
color
was
a
deep
goldenyellow
with
nequality
clarity
nose
had
a
sugary
sweetness
to
it
that
reminded
me
of
a
lager
mouthfeel
was
medium
with
a
candylike
sweetness
finish
was
likewise
sweet
much
too
sweet
for
my
taste
drinkability
kinda
high
if
you
liked
this
beer
i
however
did
not
not
much
to
this
beer
i
would
drink
this
over
bmc
anyday
but
would
pass
on
it
for
something
with
more
flavor
just
not
my
style
i
guess
pours
a
very
nice
cleanclear
golden
yellow
color
nice
carbonation
very
nice
two
finger
white
head
with
some
very
nice
sticky
lacing
the
nose
is
malty
with
some
slight
yeast
notes
and
some
spice
the
taste
is
sweet
malty
slightly
yeasty
with
a
spice
note
medium
body
drinkable
not
a
bad
little
brew
glad
to
have
had
a
chance
to
try
it
pours
a
bright
yellow
with
a
fluffy
white
head
the
bottles
artwork
is
pretty
neat
as
well
says
its
brewed
with
honey
but
i
cant
really
smell
or
taste
anything
to
indicate
that
not
surprising
seeing
as
how
you
have
to
really
dump
in
honey
to
change
the
final
beer
tastes
light
and
clean
mainly
of
pale
malt
slight
hop
bittering
and
some
noble
hoplike
flavors
not
bad
but
not
really
exciting
there
are
tastier
and
cheaper
blonde
ales
out
there
pours
brilliant
golden
with
lacey
white
head
nose
has
a
light
herbal
hop
quality
with
cerealgrain
and
bready
aromas
palate
is
rather
uninteresting
with
a
light
malt
more
cereal
flavors
and
light
hops
to
balance
easy
drinking
but
only
because
it
lacks
much
to
savor
d
overall
a
very
nice
tasting
blonde
i
was
a
bit
put
off
by
the
aroma
and
appearance
but
the
taste
saved
this
beer
very
light
and
refreshing
my
first
beer
from
ska
brewing
so
im
curious
to
see
what
else
they
do
d
easy
drinking
beer
this
is
a
pretty
mellow
beer
and
an
easy
drinking
one
to
boot
i
probably
wont
be
seeking
this
out
again
but
it
is
something
i
would
recommend
to
cross
over
drinkers
d
this
is
a
nice
and
unassuming
blond
this
isnt
my
favorite
style
but
this
beer
does
its
job
as
a
summer
refresher
kudos
to
ska
brewing
should
be
successful
in
a
can
d
a
fine
beer
just
lost
in
the
sea
of
blondelighter
ales
and
lagers
probably
best
local
and
fresh
color
was
a
light
golden
color
with
a
big
thick
white
head
that
stuck
around
for
awhile
aroma
was
light
grassy
hops
with
very
little
else
flavor
was
light
slightly
grainy
malt
with
a
grassy
hop
flavor
and
a
fair
amount
of
bitterness
for
a
blond
ale
mouthfeel
is
light
crisp
and
refreshing
hops
are
pretty
noticeable
in
this
beer
a
mix
of
floral
flavors
and
grassy
bitterness
that
could
be
because
the
malt
bill
seems
pretty
tame
not
a
whole
lot
going
on
besides
some
grainy
husky
sweetness
taste
is
pretty
average
for
the
style
light
crisp
and
refreshing
a
nice
nononsense
summertime
quencher
d
drinkable
but
i
will
not
be
seeking
out
this
beer
again
if
youre
looking
for
a
beer
that
goes
down
easily
and
doesnt
give
you
a
fight
this
one
would
be
worth
trying
d
a
very
nice
surprise
as
most
blondes
dont
offer
a
whole
of
anything
interesting
while
ska
blonde
is
not
the
most
original
brew
its
done
well
and
quite
enjoyable
decent
thirst
quencher
easy
to
drink
not
a
good
one

d
very
easy
to
drink
smooth
crips
and
clean
d
overall
a
good
session
beer
this
was
served
at
a
prewedding
party
and
provided
a
nice
introduction
to
a
broad
cross
section
of
beer
drinkers
bought
this
one
at
the
liquor
barn
in
southside
santa
fe
out
of
the
bottle
this
one
poured
a
true
gold
color
but
the
white
head
was
very
short
lived
and
left
on
wispy
lacing
great
clarity
though
the
aroma
was
light
slightly
sweet
and
grainy
the
flavors
were
at
first
a
bit
of
honey
sweetness
with
some
grassy
undertones
and
floral
hops
as
it
finished
biscuity
malts
appeared
good
mouthfeel
and
light
to
medium
bodied
not
much
to
think
about
but
a
good
session
beer
and
easy
drinking
d
again
quite
decent
for
an
everyday
watching
sports
or
grilling
beer
i
plan
to
buy
more
of
this
a
nice
little
drinker
of
a
blonde
wholesome
bready
tender
sweet
and
fulfilling
for
what
it
is
im
really
surprised
at
how
much
i
enjoyed
this
one
i
was
expecting
another
run
of
the
mill
blonde
ale
but
this
one
takes
the
basics
of
the
style
amps
them
up
a
touch
and
just
makes
everything
work
give
it
a
shot
you
might
be
surprised
drinkability
this
is
not
bad
but
i
certainly
would
want
something
else
after
one
or
two
of
these
and
i
dont
think
id
ever
have
it
very
often
in
the
first
place
easy
drinking
well
balanced
my
only
complaint
on
this
one
was
that
it
seemed
a
bit
one
dimensional
a
solid
beer
in
every
regard
very
refreshing
this
is
one
to
gret
your
friends
started
on
micro
breweries
overall
quite
drinkable
no
complaints
definitely
worth
trying
drinkability
pure
lawn
mower
beer
here
light
and
easy
to
consume
many
of
these
could
be
thrown
back
decent
but
not
overwhelming
flavor
brings
the
higher
score
here
the
ska
brewing
company
should
have
spent
more
time
on
their
brewing
recipes
and
techniques
than
it
did
on
the
cool
punk
rock
appealing
bottle
labels
i
had
this
at
kumas
corner
in
chicago
and
i
thought
it
to
be
pretty
good
especially
for
a
style
i
usually
associate
with
disappointment
this
beer
poured
a
slightly
hazy
golden
color
with
a
towering
pile
of
head
aroma
is
very
light
with
some
small
amount
of
fruitiness
what
i
didnt
get
was
a
lot
of
cerealness
which
i
usually
associate
with
beers
of
this
style
thats
a
bad
thing
flavor
was
extremely
light
and
pleasant
a
bit
of
fruitiness
and
a
touch
of
maltiness
pretty
good
mouthfeel
was
very
light
and
clean
bottom
line
a
pretty
tasty
blonde
ale
but
i
doubt
id
put
it
on
my
regular
rotation
if
it
was
available
locally
drinkability
this
is
session
beer
not
something
you
are
going
to
sit
around
and
savor
at
all
while
drinking
but
if
you
needed
something
to
take
to
a
party
especially
one
with
non
craft
beer
drinkers
this
would
fit
the
bill
pretty
well
what
you
have
here
is
a
pilsner
wolf
in
a
lambs
skin
if
you
like
strong
pilsner
beers
then
you
will
love
this
stuff
this
is
very
strongly
hopped
with
nobel
hops
and
your
liking
of
them
will
pretty
much
determine
how
well
you
will
like
this
d
very
easy
to
drink
but
wouldnt
bother
me
if
i
didnt
have
another
fits
the
style
that
earns
this
brew
some
points
not
a
bad
beer
just
another
average
attempt
at
a
pretty
average
style
flavors
are
balanced
but
mild
sweetness
becomes
cloying
after
awhile
hop
bite
gets
stronger
as
it
warms
fortunately
there
is
a
nice
hop
bitterness
providing
a
beer
taste
i
wouldnt
seek
this
out
but
it
puts
me
in
mind
of
a
decent
lager
drinkability
another
quite
quaffable
beer
from
the
rude
brewers
of
colorado
so
far
i
am
rather
pleased
with
my
ska
brewing
variety
pack
12oz
brown
bottle
with
bottled
on
date
of
july
of
2005
uh
oh
pours
a
very
slightly
hazy
golden
blond
with
a
good
2
finger
head
and
nice
lacing
slight
citrus
and
malt
aromas
mixed
with
a
bit
of
honey
slight
hop
aroma
as
well
nice
honey
malt
flavor
up
front
with
a
decent
hop
presence
in
th
middle
and
a
maltbitterness
in
the
finish
i
would
love
to
try
this
when
it
is
frsh
especiall
on
tap
not
a
bad
beer
but
it
does
have
a
ring
of
oldness
to
it
for
a
blond
ale
its
ok
body
is
just
above
light
with
an
expansive
forcedcarbonation
feel
and
grainy
texture
they
say
gentlemen
prefer
blondes
i
sir
am
not
a
gentleman
verdict
indistinct
and
burdened
by
offflavors
i
probably
wont
drink
it
again
pours
pale
clear
golden
color
with
a
foamy
white
head
that
leaves
a
nice
lacing
in
my
glass
light
bready
aroma
mild
flavors
of
bread
and
grains
light
bodied
with
a
thin
yet
crisp
mouthfeel
good
carbonation
it
does
have
a
clean
finish
not
much
flavor
but
a
decent
session
beer
overall
impression
not
a
bad
beer
but
certainly
not
an
exciting
one
either
drinkability
is
ok
its
enjoyable
if
nothing
else
poured
from
a
12oz
bottle
with
label
notched
twomonths
before
tasting
clear
pale
golden
head
is
frothy
white
one
finger
dissipating
rather
quickly
it
does
end
up
leaving
a
persistant
sticky
lace
nose
was
malty
grassysweet
made
me
want
to
jump
right
in
and
taste
it
taste
was
malt
balaned
with
hops
in
the
beginning
but
a
bit
bitter
on
the
finish
light
to
moderate
carbonation
crisp
mouthfeel
dry
finish
easy
to
drink
the
after
its
escape
from
the
12ounce
brown
bottle
resides
in
the
nonick
glass
a
cloudless
amber
color
with
the
head
upon
the
pour
moderate
in
size
semi
creamy
in
texture
and
the
color
a
winsome
light
tan
the
resultant
lace
a
fine
coating
surrounding
the
glass
nose
has
a
pleasant
malt
sweetness
a
touch
of
fresh
plowed
dirt
fresh
and
pleasant
to
the
senses
start
has
a
mild
sweetness
the
malt
decent
and
the
top
light
to
middling
in
its
feel
to
the
palate
finish
is
pleasantly
carbonated
the
hops
adequate
for
the
style
and
the
aftertaste
droughty
a
nice
drinking
beer
that
lies
easy
on
the
palate
this
is
a
pretty
nice
blonde
ale
between
the
good
balance
the
residual
sugars
and
the
saaz
hop
flavor
and
bitterness
it
makes
it
enjoyable
to
drink
my
favorite
offering
from
the
brewery
so
far
i
bet
it
tastes
quite
nice
fresh
on
tap
light
golden
in
color
with
a
big
fluffy
off
white
head
that
leaves
good
lacing
aroma
is
light
grainy
with
grassy
like
hop
aromas
smells
like
a
pilsner
taste
is
light
slightly
grainy
malt
with
a
grassy
hop
flavor
and
very
light
bitterness
might
be
an
ale
but
reminds
me
of
a
decent
pilsner
mouthfeel
is
light
crisp
and
refreshing
would
make
a
great
lawn
mower
beer
to
bad
its
winter
drinkability
is
ok
but
light
ales
arent
my
cup
of
tea
so
to
speak
if
there
yours
give
it
a
shot
if
your
like
me
dont
bother
12
ounce
bottle
kinda
boring
i
wanted
something
easy
to
drink
while
watching
the
pistons
game
tonight
so
i
picked
thispours
a
clear
light
golden
color
with
a
soapy
looking
light
head
aromas
of
toasted
grain
and
some
honey
thrown
in
not
to
badtaste
is
toasted
up
front
with
a
lightly
sweethoney
finish
this
beer
served
its
need
good
with
some
chilly
dogs
not
a
award
winner
by
any
means
but
a
quaffer
and
better
alternative
to
a
macro
lager
for
sure
poured
a
light
clear
golden
color
with
a
small
head
with
big
bubbles
that
mostly
dissipated
quickly
has
a
honey
aroma
with
floral
hints
the
initial
taste
was
of
honey
with
some
citrous
on
the
side
i
normally
expect
a
blonde
ale
to
be
pretty
bland
but
this
had
more
flavor
than
most
light
pale
yellow
color
fizzy
beer
color
only
a
bit
more
shiny
thin
small
white
head
grainy
sour
beer
smell
taste
is
very
grainy
wet
grass
and
pasta
only
a
subtle
wiff
of
honey
and
that
seemed
more
sour
than
sweet
old
beer
taste
like
stale
beer
from
your
dads
stash
in
10th
grade
taste
still
tastes
like
beer
though
and
thats
good
honey
taste
is
nearly
lost
on
me
comes
and
goes
light
bodied
highly
charged
easy
enough
going
down
not
much
lingers
a
decent
beer
nowhere
near
the
level
of
their
ten
pin
porter
worth
a
try
but
dont
lose
any
sleep
if
you
havent
had
it
yet
thanks
to
arctic
liquors
for
the
sample
